    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nA schematic of this protocol is shown in the Graphical Abstract.\nCell harvesting and embedding in agarose plugs\nTiming: 1–6 h\nThese steps describe the method of harvesting cells for SMAT such that each treatment replicate yields an agarose plug embedded with 1–2 × 106 cells. It then describes the process of embedding cells in agarose, followed by lysis and digestion with Proteinase K.\nNote: Due to potential processing of labeled DNA by various endo/exo-nucleases, work quickly, avoid light exposure, and keep cells on ice prior to embedding in agarose when harvesting multiple samples.\nEdU pulsing/labeling of cells\nThe number of cells required per treatment replicate ranges from 1–2 × 106. This protocol has been optimized for the U-2 OS adherent ALT cancer cell line but can also be used on non-adherent cells.\nCulture asynchronous cells such that they are 50%–80% confluent on the day of EdU pulsing. This protocol can also be applied to treated cells, e.g., drug-treated, siRNA transfected, or synchronized cells, when pathway analysis or cell-cycle effects are being investigated.\nAdd 1:1,000 dilution of 10 mM EdU stock directly to the culture media, for a final concentration of 10 μM, gently agitate flask to mix, then return the flask to the 37°C incubator for 1–5 h. The length of the EdU pulse is dependent on cell cycle duration and the temporal window of analysis in the case of synchronized cells. For U-2 OS, we pulse synchronized cells for 2 h and asynchronous cells for 5 h.",
    "Note: Due to reports of EdU-induced toxicity in the literature, we performed an experiment whereby we compared untreated U-2 OS cells, U-2 OS cells labeled with EdU for 5 h or mock-treated with DMSO vehicle control, washed out and allowed for recover for 24 h or one cell-cycle. We report no significant impact of EdU labeling as shown in Figure S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1472-Mmc1.pdf].\nDuring EdU labeling, melt the aliquot of LMP agarose at 68°C in a water bath for 20–30 min. Transfer the molten LMP agarose to a 50°C water bath to hold in a molten state.\nNote: Addition of EdU to cells should be performed in a Class II biosafety cabinet. Leftover EdU solution can be re-frozen. Discard EdU aliquot after 10 freeze-thaws.\nHarvesting cells:\nTrypsinize or scrape the cells. Pellet the cells at 300 g and at RT for 5 min in a 15 mL falcon tube. This can be increased to 400 g for mitotic cells.\nResuspend cells in 10 mL of PBS and count cell number using a hemocytometer, or an automated cell or particle counter e.g., Beckman Coulter Counter Z1.\nDistribute sufficient cells (in fresh falcon tubes if necessary) such that 1–2 × 106 cells are allocated to each plug. Extra tubes can be prepared if backup plugs are desired.\nPellet the cells at 300 g and at RT for 5 min then aspirate PBS from each sample, leaving behind ∼45 μL in each tube for each agarose plug. As a guide, this can be achieved by leaving ∼2 mm of PBS above the cell pellet.\nNote: Typically for U-2 OS cells, 80% confluency in a T75 flask yields three plugs.",
    "Critical: Loading too many cells in a plug can result in excessive fiber density, making it difficult to distinguish the telomere ends. Too few cells can lead to insufficient telomere ends being available for scoring.\nImmediately place the cell pellet on ice in the dark for up to 30 min, while harvesting the rest of the samples.\nResuspend cell pellets using a P200 pipette on ice, then quickly warm the samples in the 50°C water bath for 10 s (5 s for mitotic cells). Immediately add ∼45 μL molten 1.2% LMP agarose to the sample, quickly pipette to mix.\nImmediately pipette each ∼90 μL cell and agarose mix into a plug mold (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1472-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Embedding cells into agarose plugs and washing\n(A) Preparation of agarose plugs. Pipette the cell suspension & LMP agarose mix into the plug mold as indicated. Do not overfill the wells or create bubbles.\n(B) Graphic showing TE wash using a mesh gauze to prevent plugs from falling out.\nAllow the plug to set for 30–40 min at 4°C before commencing the next step. For long-term storage of plugs, wrap plugs tightly in parafilm to avoid dehydration.\nNote: Avoid overfilling plug molds with the cell-agarose mix. The tops of overfilled plugs can easily flake off and become lost during the TE wash steps (they are small enough to pass through gaps in the gauze) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nProtein digestion in plugs and stretching DNA onto coverslips\nTiming: 2 days 6 h",
    "Cells embedded in plugs are lysed in a Proteinase K lysis buffer for 16 h and washed with TE buffer to remove proteins. Agarase digestion is then used to liberate the deproteinated DNA fibers from the plugs. Digestion is performed in 0.5 M MES pH 5.5, which enables strong binding of DNA to vinyl silane coated coverslips. DNA fibers are stretched onto vinyl silanized coverslips using a Molecular Combing System, and fixed by baking (Gallo et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nAdd 275 μL of ESP solution (made fresh on the day) to a fresh 15 mL falcon tube for each sample/plug. For each plug, add in the following order, mix, and centrifuge for 1 min at 300 g:\n200 μL of 0.5 M EDTA pH 8.0\n25 μL 10% sarcosyl/0.5 M EDTA\n50 μL 20 mg/mL Proteinase K\nRemove the plastic seal backing on the plug mold. The plugs should remain in the molds and not fall out.\nUsing round-headed tweezers, gently push the solidified agarose plugs into each falcon tube containing ESP solution.\nGently flick the tube down such that all the plugs are completely immersed in ESP solution.\nIncubate the tubes in a 50°C water bath, without agitation, in the dark for 16 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1472-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Example of YOYO-stained DNA fibers\n(A) intact good-quality fibers and (B) sheared low-quality fibers. Scale bar 20 μm.\nCritical: After lysis of the cells followed by protein digestion, the DNA in the agarose plugs is vulnerable to shearing. Handle plugs carefully after Proteinase K digestion and do not shake or vortex. Sheared DNA fibers will negatively impact quantitation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nThe next day, check that the plugs are intact.",
    "Discard the ESP buffer by carefully tilting the tube while ensuring the plug does not come out. It does not matter if some of the ESP buffer remains in the tube.\nWash plugs three times for 1 h each with TE buffer:\nFill each 15 mL tube (including plug) with TE buffer up to the top, wrap the tube in aluminum foil, and incubate for 1 h at 20°C–25°C in the dark with slow rotation on an orbital shaker. Do not use darkened tubes as you will need to check for the presence of the plug.\nDiscard TE wash, using a mesh gauze to prevent plugs from falling out (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nDuring each TE wash, examine each tube for the presence of the agarose plug. Plugs may be difficult to see but can be best visualized in natural light next to a window.\nNote: Plugs are fragile. If they get stuck on the gauze, gently tap them off using the rim of the falcon tube. Alternatively, use fresh TE buffer to wash plugs off the gauze and back into the tube.\nRepeat TE buffer washes two more times incubating with rotation for 1 h at 20°C–25°C each time.\nWash for a fourth and final time with TE buffer for 3–4 h, then discard the wash.\nPause point: Plugs can then be stored in TE buffer in the dark in a 4°C cold room for several months.\nCritical: Do not store plugs in a fridge, as vibrations may shear the DNA.\nMelt agarose plugs to release the DNA:\nSet a heat block to 68°C.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.5 M MES pH 5.5 solution to fresh 2 mL microtubes (nuclease-free).",
    "Use a micro sampling spatula with a bent end to gently transfer each plug from the falcon tube to the 2 mL microtube.\nCheck that the plug is fully immersed in MES solution and incubate at 68°C for 20 min to melt the plug (covered with aluminum foil).\nAdjust the heat block temperature to 42°C and allow to equilibrate for 10 min.\nIn meantime, aliquot Agarase such that you have enough for 2 μL per sample plus 20% extra.\nAfter the 10 min is up, warm the aliquoted Agarase for ∼10 s on the heat block, then add 2 μL of Agarase to each sample and gently invert the microtube to mix (do not vortex).\nIncubate on the heat block at 42°C for 16 h (covered with aluminum foil).\nCritical: The agarose plug must be completely melted into the MES solution or DNA fibers will clump on the coverslip when stretching the DNA fibers.\nThe next day, add 700 μL of MES buffer to fresh disposable reservoirs.\nRemove the Agarase-digested samples from the 42°C heating block and allow to cool to 20°C–25°C.\nTransfer Agarase-digested DNA fiber solution to disposable reservoirs by tipping.\nGently invert the disposable reservoirs to homogenize the DNA fiber solution.\nPlace the reservoirs in the reservoir bench holder.\nPause point: DNA fiber solutions in MES buffer can be stored in the dark for up to a week at 20°C–25°C.\nStretch the DNA fibers onto coverslips (see Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]):\nPlace a reservoir into the FiberComb® machine receptacle. Load the vinyl silanized coverslip.\nStretch the DNA fibers onto the coverslips (∼ 5 min) using the FiberComb® machine.\nCarefully place the freshly prepared coverslips onto a coverslip rack holder\nNote: Avoid vibrations or bumping the bench while the FiberComb® machine is operating.",
    "Note: The FiberComb® machine should be regularly calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions to ensure a constant stretching factor of 2 kb/μm is maintained. Perform a no-sample operating cycle (see Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]) and check that the machine’s soaking time is 5 min ± 10 s and the combing time is 1 min and 40 s ± 5 s. If the times differ from required, perform instrument maintenance as described in the instruction manual from Genomic Vision - https://store.genomicvision.com/index.php?controller=attachment&id_attachment=2[href=https://store.genomicvision.com/index.php?controller=attachment&id_attachment=2].\nBake coverslips at 60°C in a fan-forced oven:\nFor “DNA-fiber quality check[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]”, stretch DNA fibers from one reservoir onto an extra coverslip and bake for 1–2 h. We routinely perform a DNA-fiber quality check on one slide per experimental batch.\nFor “Telomere FISH probing, Click-iT EdU-labeling and YOYO-1 staining[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5]”, bake coverslips for 3–4 h.\nLet coverslips cool to 20°C–25°C protected from light.\nPause point: Baked and dried coverslips can be stored for up to a year at 20°C–25°C in the dark.\nNote: Coverslips are stored on a coverslip rack holder for convenience. Washes can be performed on the rack holder, minimizing handling of the coverslips and saving time.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nVideo S1. Captioned video showcasing how to perform DNA fiber stretching onto coverslips using the FiberComb® machine, related to step 27.\nDNA-fiber quality check\nTiming: 1 h\nStretched DNA is stained with YOYO-1, which is a sensitive dsDNA binding fluorophore, to check that the Proteinase K treatment and Agarase digestion of plugs has been performed correctly. YOYO-1 staining also enables fiber density and quality to be checked, to ensure that fibers are not short or sheared (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), prior to progressing with the protocol: Telomere FISH probing, Click-iT EdU-labeling and YOYO-1 staining[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.5].",
    "Note: The YOYO-1 staining intensity from the DNA-fiber quality check will be more intense than after the Click-iT EdU-labeling and YOYO-1 staining process. Additionally, the fiber density will be slightly higher. This should be considered when deciding whether to proceed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nNote: If the DNA fibers are too dense after checking the YOYO-stain (i.e., you cannot readily distinguish YOYO-1 stained DNA ends), dilute the fiber solution in the reservoir with more 0.5 M MES solution and re-stretch on fresh coverslips. If the fibers are too sparse, stretching DNA onto the same coverslip again after initial stretching can help increase fiber density for imaging.\nDilute the 1 mM YOYO-1 stock 1:4,000 in ABDIL or equivalent blocking solution.\nIncubate coverslip with YOYO-1/ABDIL solution for 15 min at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove coverslip and wash twice in 1× PBS for 5 min each.\nRinse with deionized water to remove salt traces from your coverslips\nAir dry coverslips and visualize on the microscope\nTelomere FISH probing, Click-iT EdU-labeling, and YOYO-1 staining\nTiming: 6 h up to 22 h\nDNA fibers that have been stretched and baked onto coverslips are subject to non-denaturing FISH with G-rich telomere probe conjugated to TAMRA fluorophore (TelG-TAMRA) . We then describe the washing steps and subsequent labeling of incorporated EdU (on the DNA fiber), followed by detection of DNA fibers with YOYO-1. Non-denaturing FISH is required for YOYO-1 staining to work. YOYO-1 and EdU-labeling is performed in a single step to save time. Stained slides are then mounted with antifade solution for microscopy imaging.\nSubject coverslips to an ice-cold (pre-chilled at −20°C) ethanol dehydration series: 70% ethanol for 3 min, 90% ethanol for 2 min, 100% ethanol for 2 min.\nImmerse coverslips, held in a coverslip rack holder, in a small beaker containing ∼80 mL ice-cold ethanol solution.",
    "Replace ethanol solution according to ethanol series then repeat from previous sub-step.\nAir dry coverslips at 37°C for 10 min.\nWhile the coverslips dry, prepare slides in a dark humidifying chamber by adding 50 μL TelG-TAMRA PNA probe to each slide. Gently place each coverslip on the PNA probe, label side up (or down if desired).\nIncubate at 20°C–25°C in the dark humidifying chamber for 3 h at 37°C.\nCritical: While handling coverslips, it is important to label the front of the coverslip rack holder and record the order and orientation of coverslips in the holder e.g., label face up. Incubations should always be performed with consistent positioning of the label to ensure correct staining of the same side of each coverslip.\nCritical: Non-denaturing FISH is required for subsequent YOYO-1 staining to work. It is important to use the TelG (TTAGGG)3 PNA probe. For reasons that are unclear, TelC (CCCAAT)3 produces a poor signal.\nNote: Bubbles trapped underneath the coverslip can be released by gently moving the coverslip. Do not push down on the coverslip as this will scrape off the DNA fibers.\nTransfer the coverslips back to the coverslip rack holder and commence washes (∼80 mL each) in a small beaker in the dark:\nWash coverslips for 5 min in prewarmed 37°C 1× SSC/50% formamide (use Formamide (ACS reagent) from Sigma – see “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”).\nWash twice for 5 min with prewarmed 37°C 2× SSC.\nWash once for 5 min with 2× SSC/0.1% Tween at 20°C–25°C.\nRinse once with deionized water.\nFix coverslips with 4% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nCritical: Fixation with 4% formaldehyde in PBS is essential to stop denaturation of DNA fibers. Denaturation will result in reduced YOYO-1 signal, which will inhibit fiber detection.",
    "Discard fixative then wash twice for 5 min with PBS.\nPrepare a 1:100 dilution of 1 mM YOYO-1 iodide solution (Invitrogen) in ABDIL. Store at −20°C in the dark.\nPrepare the Click-It & YOYO-1 staining master mix (CYMM) as listed in “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”. It is important to add the components in order, otherwise the reaction will not proceed optimally. Use the Click-iT® reaction cocktail within 15 min of preparation.\nPrepare 1× Click-iT® EdU buffer additive by diluting the 10× solution (Click-iT™ Plus EdU Cell Proliferation Kit for Imaging) 1:10 in MQW. Prepare this additive solution fresh and discard any unused 1× solution. Other components can be returned to storage temperature.\nAdd 150 μL of CYMM to each slide then overlay with the coverslip.\nIncubate for 30 min at 20°C–25°C in a dark humidifying chamber.\nNote: We combine EdU Click-iT labeling and YOYO-1 staining into a single step.\nTransfer coverslips back to the coverslip rack holder and wash twice with PBS for 5 min each.\nAir dry the slides at 37°C for 30 min in a fan-forced oven or for 16 h at 20°C–25°C in the dark.\nMount the coverslips onto microscope slides using Prolong gold antifade.\nAllow slides to cure for 30 min at 20°C–25°C in the dark. Store slides in the fridge in a slide folder (in the dark).\nNote: Prolong Gold® is a curing mounting agent and as such needs to harden through drying and storage in the fridge prior to imaging. Other commercial or homemade antifade mounting reagents are also likely to be suitable.\nPause point: Mounted coverslips can be stored for up to 6 months in the fridge.\nMicroscopy imaging\nRemove slides from the fridge and allow to equilibrate to 20°C–25°C for about 10 min.",
    "Perform automated imaging of 2,500–3,500 tiles on the Axio Imager Z.2 microscope or any other epifluorescence microscope with semi-automated tiling capability. For U-2 OS cells, ∼2,800 tiles are sufficient; however, if fiber density is lower the number of tiles imaged may need to be increased (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). We perform imaging using the Plan-APO 63X/1.40-Oil objective.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1472-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. ZEN Blue microscope imaging interface and key settings used for imaging\n(A) Screenshot of tiling setup (red grid) and support points (yellow markers).\n(B) Settings used for adaptive autofocus under the “Focus Strategy” tab on the left side panel.\n(C) Settings used under the “Tiles” tab on the left side panel.\nFirst, select the FITC, DsRed, and Cy5 excitation and emission filters to detect YOYO-1 (DNA), TelG-TAMRA (Telomere G-probe) and AF647 (EdU Click-label) fluorescence, respectively. Guideline exposure settings are in Methods S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1472-Mmc3.zip]\nEnable “Tiles” on the ZEN software and change settings in “Focus Strategy” to enable the adaptive focus imaging method on ZEN (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). This uses the initial Z-coordinates defined by the support points generated by the user to create a dynamic focal plane, which updates in real-time to compensate for drift.\nFor convenience, we have attached an example imaging method file in “Methods S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1472-Mmc3.zip]”. The settings file that must be opened in ZEN software. After importing into ZEN, check that the following settings are correct:\nSelect YOYO-1 as the reference channel. This will be used for the adaptive focusing.\nSet up approximately 20–30 support points on the ZEN Blue microscope imaging software (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nSet up tiling according to the settings shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B. Enable stitching to allow analysis of telomere tracts that traverse separate tiles (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nVerify the support points by manually adjusting the focus until the YOYO-1 DNA fiber staining becomes focused.",
    "Select “Start Experiment” and allow imaging to perform for 12–16 h, depending on tile imaging area.\nNote: We advise supervising the imaging for several tiles to check that the autofocus is working correctly. If the autofocus does not work, switching to TAMRA as the reference channel may help."
