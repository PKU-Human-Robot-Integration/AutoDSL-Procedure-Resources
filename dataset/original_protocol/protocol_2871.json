The medium is changed every two days along the\n      differentiation and cells will start beating by days 12–18 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). We observed that 30% confluency is optimal to induce a successful\n      differentiation for multiple hPSC lines. Starting the differentiation at a\n      low confluency allows reaching approximately 100% confluency at day 4 of\n      differentiation. We found that if 100% confluency is reached before or\n      after day 4, the differentiation efficiency will be significantly reduced.\n      This step is not described in the manufacturer protocol and should be\n      implemented to reduce variability in the differentiation efficiency when\n      comparing multiple cell lines. It is crucial to start with high quality\n      karyotypically normal hPSCs, with passage number below 50 and showing a\n      good expression of pluripotency markers.
