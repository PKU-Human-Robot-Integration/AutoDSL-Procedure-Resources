    "This protocol has been previously approved by and follows the guidelines set by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board. Data shown were collected as part of a project approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Iowa. Participants gave informed consent and the studies were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Equipment\nCheck the equipment table to verify that all required equipment is available. Double check the configuration using the graphic depiction of the equipment in Figure 2.\n2. Plethysmography\nNOTE: Barometric plethysmography is a well-described clinical tool and is performed using commercial equipment according to the consensus statements on standardizing lung volume measurements14,15. When necessary, lung flows and volumes are compared to predicted values from the NHANES data set and Goldman and Becklake16 that are included in the plethysmograph software.\nPerform calibration of the plethysmograph daily and prior to any experiments.\n\t\nMeasure the temperature, barometric pressure and relative humidity using a standard barometer prior to the calibration and enter these values into the plethysmograph software as correction factors.\nCalibrate the flow sensor using a calibrated 3 L syringe at variable flow rates. Calibrate the box pressure using a precise 50 mL pump. Box pressure transducers should be checked monthly and re-calibrated as needed, per manufacturer’s recommendation.\nImmediately prior to the measurement, place the participant in the whole body plethysmograph and close the door. Make measurements after 30-60 s, which allows for thermal equilibration.\n\t\nInstruct the participant to place their mouth on the mouthpiece, put on nose clips, and place their hands on their cheeks. Preventing “puffing” of the cheeks during the maneuver minimizes changes in volume that result from changing the mouth volume.",
    "Instruct the participant to breathe normally, allowing at least four tidal breaths to be acquired and functional residual capacity (FRC) to be established.\nAt the end of a normal exhalation (FRC), close the shutter. Coach the participant to pant lightly at 0.5-1 breaths/s for 3-4 s. Evaluate the relationship between the mouth pressure and plethysmograph pressure to ensure that it is a series of overlapping, straight lines without thermal drift.\nOpen the shutter and allow the participant to take a normal breath. Coach the participant to exhale to residual volume (RV), followed by a maximal inspiratory maneuver to total lung capacity. Repeat at least three times until FRC values that agree within 5% are obtained\n3. Volumetric Capnography\nNOTE: Steps 3.1 – 3.4 are performed before the arrival of the research subject.\nBefore proceeding, address the variables in Table 1 and modify if needed. It is important that these variables are adjusted during the study design phase and then held constant for the duration of the study.\n\t\nBefore beginning a new experimental protocol, take care to accurately measure the time delay between the gas analyzer, which measures CO2 concentration, and the pneumotach, which measures flow. This allows for the CO2 and flow signals to be aligned.\nMeasure the time delay experimentally with a stream of 5% CO2. Attach the gas line to a stopcock, followed by the mouthpiece.\nOpen the stopcock, introducing the gas at a rate of 10 L/min. Determine the mean time delay between the response of the pneumotach and gas analyzer over 10 trials and enter into the macro.",
    "Maintain the time delay constant by maintaining the analyzer sampling rate. The time delay is highly dependent on the sampling rate of the gas analyzer and it is critical that this remain constant through the experiment and between participants.\nDefine three “channels” for the collection of flow, exhaled CO2 (%), and volume. Flow and exhaled CO2 (%) are analog inputs and volume is the integral of flow.\n\t\nConfirm that flow and CO2 (%) are measured directly from the pneumotach and gas analyzer and that volume is calculated as the integral of flow. Figure 3 shows that these are being collected in channels 1,2, and 6.\nCalibrate the gas analyzer prior to each use. Include the O2 sensor if this is to be measured.\n\t\nZero the analyzer with an inert gas. 100% calibration grade (<0.01% contaminant) N2 or He may be used, although helium is preferred because nitrogen may be contaminated with trace amounts of oxygen. Place the drying tube in a bag or connect to a mixing chamber. Flush the bag or chamber with inert gas at a rate of at least 10 L/min. Care should be taken not to pressurize the system as this can impact the calibration.\nFlood the bag or chamber with inert gas to displace O2 and the CO2. Once the displayed concentrations of CO2 and O2 stabilize, adjust the zero knobs until they both read zero.\nRepeat with 6% CO2 and room air (20.93% O2) as calibration gases. When the concentration of the desired gas stabilizes, adjust the span knob to match the concentration of the calibration gas.\nRecheck the inert gas and calibration gases and adjust the zero and span until both are accurate ±0.1%.\nCalibrate the heated pneumotach according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "Briefly, allow the pneumotach to warm to 37 °C for at least 20 min prior to the study.\nSelect the drop-down menu of the flow channel (Channel 1), select the Spirometer menu option, and click Zero to zero the pneumotach. Finish by selecting Okay.\nDirectly connect a 3L syringe to the pneumotach using a flow head adapter. Highlight the calibration breath. Again, select the drop-down menu of the flow channel. Select Spirometer flow | Calibrate, type in 3L, and select Okay\"\\.\nCheck the calibration by injecting 3L into the pneumotach at varying flow rates (0-4 L/s, 4-8 L/s, and 8-12 L/s). The difference from 3 L should be less than 5%.\nCollect the maneuver, ensuring that two sequential breaths are collected and that they are made at the same flow rate.\n\t\nCoach the subject to perform a single maneuver consisting of two pairs of breaths – a coaching breath and a breath for analysis. This is shown graphically in Figure 1 (bottom).\nDuring the maneuver, coach the participants to follow the flow guide on the computer monitor. The investigator may coach the subject by indicating “inhale now” or “exhale now”.\nPerform the maneuver so that there are two pairs of these breaths in a single maneuver. The first exhalation of the maneuver is 3 s and the second is 5 s. Consider adding a resistor in-line with the mouthpiece in order to make exhaled flow easier to control. A resistance with 5 cm H2O/L/s of resistance is generally well-tolerated.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important that if a resistor is used, it is used throughout the study and for every participant because it increases mouth and airway pressure, which can change airway diameter. It is also important that participants not “puff out” their cheeks as this increases the dead space.\nMeasurement protocol",
    "Instruct the participant to sit straight with both feet on the floor, put nose clips on their nose and place their mouth on the mouthpiece.\nCoach the participant to complete at least one minute of tidal breathing. This is for measures of metabolic function and allows the participant to familiarize themselves with the mouthpiece. After one minute, stop data collection.\nNext, coach the participants to vary their tidal volume, taking either normal, smaller- or larger than normal tidal breaths. This ensures that the capnograms are obtained at different lung volumes\nCoach the participant that they should transition to performing a capnogram maneuver as soon as they see the flow tracing appear on their screen.\nResume data collection at a random point in the participant’s respiratory cycle. This allows for measurements to be made at different lung volumes.\nFinally, coach to perform a sigh at the end of each maneuver, completely relaxing the muscles of respiration. This allows for FRC to be determined.\nStop data collection. Repeat Steps 3.6.3-3.6.5 until at least 6-8 maneuvers (12 -16 pairs of breaths for analysis) are completed.\n4. Data Analysis\nExporting Data. To run through the macro, each pair of breaths must be exported as a single text file that is then imported into the macro. Screen shots of this process are given in Supplemental Figure 1.\n\t\nHighlight each pair of breaths, taking to care to highlight a portion of the exhalation before the maneuver begins.\nUnder the file menu, select Export, and name the subject's maneuver.\nUse the drop-down menu under Save As Type and save it as a data file. Then select Save.\nThis will prompt an Export As Text box to appear. On the right deselect Block header Columns, Time, Date, Comments, and Event Markers.",
    "On the left, select Current Selection and Output NaN for Values. Select Downsample by and enter 10 into the box.\nSelect the Flow Channel and the CO2 (%) Channel to be exported and click Okay. Consider making duplicates of these exported files as backups before beginning the analysis.\nPerform the macro analysis. The Step-by-step annotated screen shots of for analyzing exported maneuvers with the macro and comparing to lung volume are given in Supplemental Figure 2 and may be used as a guide.\n\t\nOpen the macro, go to file, and select Open.\nSelect the saved data file, saved with the .txt extension.\nA Text Import Wizard box will appear. In the upper left-hand corner, select Delimited and click Next. For step 2, select Tab under Delimiters and click Next. For step 3, select General under Column Data Format and click Finish.\nTo run the macro, select View, Macro, View Macro, and Run in succession. Select Yes if there is a backup copy of the data.\nAllow the macro to run (approximately 90 s) and generate a workbook with four sheets. Of relevance to these measurements, Sheet 2 contains the numeric data and Chart 3 contains a plot of the capnogram.\nReturn to the data and determine the volume for FRC. This is identified as the volume at the end of the sigh at which flow = 0 L/s.\nDetermine the volume at which the second exhalation in each pair of breaths was begun. By subtracting this from the FRC volume, the starting volume above or below FRC can be determined for each breath.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
