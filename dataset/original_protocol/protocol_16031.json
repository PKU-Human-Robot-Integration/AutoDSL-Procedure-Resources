    "This protocol describes the preparation of competent yeast cells using the Y190 strain and subsequent transformation with BD and AD clones (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-tbl-0001]; also see Strategic Planning). For general guidelines on preparing yeast media and selection plates, please refer to the Yeast Protocols Handbook from Clontech. For the generation of competent yeast cells and transformation, this protocol uses a commercially available kit (Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation IITM Kit, Zymo Research). The competent cells created via this method can be frozen at −80°C for future use. We first describe how to set up and grow overnight cultures of Y190 and how to prepare competent cells, followed by a method of slow freezing that allows retaining the competency of frozen cells. We then describe the steps involved in yeast transformation using the bait and prey constructs. For a more commonly used but time-consuming transformation method using lithium acetate (LiAc), please refer to Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0002].\nMaterials\nYeast strain: Any compatible strains can be used (see Strategic Planning); here, we use Y190 maintained on Yeast Extract-Adenine-Peptone-Dextrose (YAPD) agar plates (Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0003])\nYAPD liquid medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-rec-0012])\nFrozen-EZ Yeast Transformation IITM Kit (Zymo Research, cat. no.

Inoculate a single colony of Y190 from a stock agar plate (Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0003]) into a 15-cm long glass culture tube containing 5 ml of YAPD liquid medium.\nFrozen yeast competent cells can be prepared from any yeast strains by following the steps of this protocol.\nUse freshly streaked yeast colonies, not older than 1 week, for high transformation efficiency.\nPerform all steps under sterile conditions, to avoid contamination.\n2. Incubate overnight (up to 16 hr) at 30°C with constant shaking at 200 rpm.\n3. The next day, measure the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of a 1:10 dilution of the overnight culture (i.e., 100 μl of the overnight culture in 900 μl YAPD) using a spectrophotometer.\n4. In a fresh 50-ml Erlenmeyer flask, dilute the overnight culture with YAPD medium to an OD600 = 0.3 in a final volume of 10 ml. To calculate the amount of overnight culture needed, use the following formula:\n         formula:\n\\begin{equation*} \\frac{{\\bm{Vf}{\\rm\\;{*}}\\;0.3}}{{ODM{\\rm\\;{*}}\\;DF}} \\end{equation*}\nVf (final volume) = 10 ml\nODM = Measured OD600 of the 1:10 diluted overnight culture\nDF (dilution factor) = 10\nFor example: If the ODM of the 1/10 dilution is 0.5, add 0.6 ml of the overnight culture to 10 ml of YAPD.\nVf can be changed while scaling up. You can prepare multiple 10-ml tubes or 50-ml Erlenmeyer flasks accordingly.\nUse a higher DF if the 5-ml overnight culture is overgrown and the OD600 value of 1:10 dilution does not fit into the linear detection range of the spectrophotometer.",
    "5. Let the yeast culture grow at 30°C with constant shaking at 200 rpm until the OD600 is between 0.8 and 1.0.\nAn OD600 between 0.8 and 1.0 will be reached within 2-3 hr. Measure the OD600 of 1:10 dilutions of the culture several times during the incubation period at regular intervals to avoid overgrowth, as the transformation efficiency decreases drastically when the OD600 is more than 1.0.\n6. Transfer the culture to a 15-ml polycarbonate tube and pellet the cells by centrifuging 4 min at 500 × g, room temperature.\n7. Carefully discard the supernatant using a 5-ml pipette, without disturbing the pellet.\n8. Add 10 ml of Frozen-EZ Yeast Solution 1 (Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation IITM Kit, Zymo Research) and carefully resuspend the pellet by pipetting up and down.\n9. Pellet the cells again by centrifugation for 4 min at 500 × g, room temperature.\n10. Add 1 ml of Frozen-EZ Yeast Solution 2 (Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation IITM Kit, Zymo Research) to the tube. Resuspend the cells by slowly pipetting up and down.\n11. Dispense the cells in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes as 50-μl aliquots. At this point, the competent cells can directly be used for transformation (see next step), or slowly frozen (see note below) and stored at −80°C for future use.\nIt is important to freeze the cells slowly (Cabrera et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-bib-0005]) to retain the competency. This can be achieved by wrapping the tubes containing competent cells with seven layers of tissue paper or placing them inside a Styrofoam box and sealing, before transferring them to the −80°C freezer.\nCells can be used at least for the next 6 months without losing efficiency (Zymo Research, Frozen-EZ yeast Transformation IITM Protocol).\nTransformation of competent cells with bait and prey plasmids",
    "12. For each transformation, add 1 μg each of bait and prey plasmids in less than 5 μl of total volume to a clean 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. In addition, prepare a control 1.5-ml tube without any plasmid DNA, to rule out contamination in the competent cells, and include the proper positive and negative controls.\nPositive control: Choose a reliable interaction that has been observed before in yeast to confirm that the assay is carried out optimally (here, we use pAS2-1_SPA1 + pACT2_PAP2).\nNegative controls: Co-transform the bait plasmid containing the ORF of the POI (e.g., pAS2-1_SPA1) together with an empty prey plasmid (pACT2_GW). Likewise, co-transform the prey plasmid carrying the ORF of the POI (e.g., pACT2_PAP2) together with an empty bait plasmid (pAS2-1-GW). These controls ensure that the bait or prey protein alone does not activate the reporter gene (autoactivation). In case of autoactivation, swap the POIs between bait and prey fusions via cloning or change the yeast strain/system (see Strategic Planning).\nFor the “no DNA” control, use water or the buffer in which the plasmid DNA was resuspended.\n13. Thaw the frozen yeast competent cells at room temperature. Add 50 μl of competent cells (aliquot from one tube of competent cells; see step 11) to each microcentrifuge tube.\nIt is important not to thaw the cells abruptly at temperatures higher than room temperature. Also, avoid thawing the cells on ice.\n14. Add 500 μl of Frozen-EZ Yeast Solution 3 (Frozen-EZ Yeast Transformation IITM Kit, Zymo Research) to each tube and mix well by pipetting up and down.\nEZ3 is a viscous solution. To make sure that the plasmids and EZ3 are mixed properly, pipette up and down at least four times.",
    "15. Incubate the tubes at 30°C for 45 min. In between, vortex the tubes briefly at least 2-3 times (once in every 10-15 min).\n16. Transfer 50-150 μl of each transformation mix onto separate SD/–LW plates and spread using sterile glass beads. To evenly spread the mix, place 4-7 sterile glass beads onto each plate. Then, cover with lid and move each plate forward and backward, and left to right, at least three times in each direction.\nThe entire 150 μl of transformation mix can be plated when more colonies are desired, such as during a Y2H library transformation. For routine Y2H transformation involving only two POIs, plating 50 μl should provide sufficient colonies for downstream assays.\n17. Open and allow the plates to dry for 10 min in a biosafety cabinet.\n18. Remove the glass beads (by pouring them into a bottle containing 80% ethanol) and wrap the plates with Parafilm to prevent loss of moisture from the plates during incubation.\nThe glass beads can be reused after washing in 80% ethanol, drying, and subsequent autoclaving.\n19. Invert the wrapped plates and incubate for 3-4 days at 30°C, until colonies appear.\nYeast colonies appear if co-transformed with both bait and prey plasmids. Positive control plates should also obtain colonies. A successful transformation usually provides 105-106 colonies per μg of the circular plasmid.\nColonies on the control plate without plasmid DNA suggest yeast contamination or problems in selection.\nProceed to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0004] immediately or store the plates for a maximum of 15 days. Storing for more than 15 days negatively affects the quantitative assay, due to non-uniform yeast growth at later stages.",
    "As an alternative to the kit-based preparation of competent yeast cells and transformation described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0001], we provide here a LiAc-mediated protocol (adapted from the Yeast Protocol Handbook, Clontech). Compared to Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0001], this method is more time-consuming, and the competent cells cannot be stored for more than 4 hr after preparation. However, compared to Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0001], this method is cheaper, as it does not involve a commercial kit. In this protocol, yeast cells from an overnight culture are pelleted, washed in 1× TE buffer, and resuspended in 1× TE buffer containing LiAc, before being used directly for transformation. The following protocol should yield sufficient competent cells for 16 transformations. For a general overview, see Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-fig-0002].\nMaterials\nYeast strain: Any compatible strains can be used (see Strategic Planning); here, we use Y190 maintained on YAPD agar plates (Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0003])\nY190 Genotype: MATa, ura3-52, his3-D200, lys2-801, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4D, gal80D, URA3::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-lacZ, cyhr2, LYS2::GALUAS-HIS3TATA-HIS3.

Combine all the cells in one of the 50-ml tubes.\n5. Centrifuge for 5 min at 2000 × g, room temperature. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of TE/LiAc solution.\nUse the competent cells within 1 hr of preparation to have the highest efficiency.

Keep the tubes with the plasmids on ice.",
    "8. Optional: Use salmon sperm DNA. To denature the salmon sperm DNA for use, boil for 5 min in a heat block and cool on ice immediately to avoid renaturing. Add 10 μl of salmon sperm DNA to each tube.\nUse fresh stocks of salmon sperm DNA to avoid contamination, or divide into small aliquots and use one at a time.\nThe salmon sperm DNA may act as a carrier, enhancing the uptake of the plasmids during yeast transformation. The use of carrier DNA is optional, as we do not see an improvement in efficiency compared to the samples without it in routine yeast transformations. However, the addition of salmon sperm DNA may help achieve higher efficiencies in high-throughput assays like Y2H screening.\n9. Add 60 μl of competent yeast cell solution (from step 5) to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing the bait and prey plasmids, or the control.\n10. Add 300 μl of PEG/LiAc to each tube and mix by vortexing vigorously for 5 to 10 s.\n11. Incubate the samples for 30 min at 30°C in a water bath and gently mix every 10 min.\n12. Add 35 μl of DMSO to each sample and mix carefully by inverting the tubes. Incubate the samples at 42°C in a water bath for 20 min and carefully mix them every 5 min.\nThe heat shock allows the DNA to enter the cells.\n13. Chill the cells on ice for 1-2 min. Pellet the cells by centrifugation for 2 min at 2000 × g, at room temperature.\nThis step is important to obtain higher transformation efficiency.\n14. Remove the supernatant and carefully resuspend the cells in 200 μl of 1× TE buffer.",
    "15. Transfer 100 μl of each sample to different plates with appropriate dropout medium (e.g., SD/-LW) and spread using sterile glass beads. To evenly spread the mix, place four to seven sterile glass beads onto each plate. Then, cover with lid and move the plate forward and backward, and left to right, at least three times in each direction.\n16. Follow Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0001], steps 17 to 19, and incubate the plates at 30°C until colonies appear.\nProceed to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0004] subsequently or store the plates for a maximum of 15 days. Storing for more than 15 days negatively affects the quantitative assay, due to non-uniform yeast growth in later steps.",
    "The following protocol provides detailed instructions for the long-term storage and subsequent recovery of yeast strains. Long-term storage of yeast strains is achieved by resuspending a single colony of yeast from a fresh YAPD agar plate (the master plate) in YAPD medium and glycerol before transferring to a −80°C freezer. For recovery, a small amount of frozen yeast cells is streaked onto a YAPD agar plate and grown at 30°C until colonies appear. Fresh colonies of yeast strains can be maintained in solid YAPD medium [e. g., YAPD without uracil (–Ura) for Y190] at 4°C for a maximum of 2 weeks. Fresh colonies can be obtained by streaking the old colonies onto new medium. However, repeating this many times (passage) may lead to the accumulation of, unwanted spontaneous mutations. Hence, always revive the yeast cells from frozen glycerol stocks maintained at −80°C.\nMaterials\nYeast strain (e.g., Y190) grown on a YAPD agar plate\nYAPD liquid medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-rec-0012])\nSterile 50% (v/v) glycerol in water (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-rec-0004])\nYAPD agar (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-rec-0012]) in polycarbonate disposable Petri dishes, 60 × 15 mm, 10 mm grid size (VWR, cat no. 25384-093 or equivalent)\n200-μl pipette tips\n1.5-ml screw-cap microcentrifuge tubes (Sarstedt, cat. no. 72.692.005)\nVortex mixer (VWR, Vortex VV3, cat. no. 444-007 or equivalent)\nParafilm (VWR, cat. no. 291-1212)\nLong-term storage of yeast strains (adapted from Yeast Protocol Handbook, Clontech)\n1.

    "5. Invert the tube and vortex several times to mix the cells and glycerol.\n6. Label the tube and store at −80°C.\nFor storage up to 1 year, a temperature of at least −60°C is required.\nReviving frozen yeast stocks\n7.

    "Here, we describe the quantification of β-gal activity using X-gal as substrate. An overview of the protocol is given in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-fig-0002]. In this protocol, several co-transformed yeast colonies selected on SD plates and belonging to one plasmid combination (e.g., BD-SPA1 + AD-PAP2) are combined, resuspended in sterile water, and plated as droplets on fresh SD plates. The lawn of cells obtained after 48 hr of growth at 30°C is scrapped, pelleted, and used for X-gal assay in 96-well microtiter plates in PBS buffer with agarose. The plates are then incubated at room temperature to allow blue color development, which can be quantified by first taking photographs using a smartphone camera or a DSLR camera and then analyzing the images with an ImageJ-based plugin.\nAll the steps in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0004] should be performed under sterile conditions.

Add 750 μl of sterile water to 1.5-ml labeled microcentrifuge tubes (three biological replicates for each transformation).\n2. Under sterile conditions, pick five colonies per master plate containing co-transformed yeast colonies (from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0001] or Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0002]) using 200-μl sterile pipette tips (use one tip per colony) and resuspend in one of the tubes from step 1. This tube represents biological replicate number 1. Similarly, pick 5 additional colonies from the same master plate two more times and resuspend in the remaining tubes, corresponding to biological replicate numbers 2 and 3, respectively. See the schematic given in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-fig-0002]. Repeat this step for all the samples/master plates.\n3. Vortex each tube (each biological replicate) for 3 s. Allow a moment for the cells to settle and repeat vortexing. Repeat this at least 3-5 times or until a homogenous yeast cell suspension is obtained.",
    "Since yeast cells tend to settle down within seconds after vortexing, handle one tube at a time.\n4. Pipette ten 20-μl droplets from each biological replicate onto separate square Petri plates with SD/–LW agar medium (Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-fig-0002]).\nHandle one tube at a time to avoid settling of the yeast of cells. Alternatively, vortex for at least 3 s, just before pipetting.\nUsually, ten droplets fit in 1 row, and up to 8 rows are possible in one square Petri plate (see Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-fig-0002]). For a smaller number of samples, round Petri plates can be used. Make sure to place three biological replicates from each SD/–LW plate in three different square Petri dishes, as depicted in different colors in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-fig-0002], to account for plate-to-plate effects or uncontrollable experimental variables.\nDepending on the Y2H system, SD plates may differ in composition compared to the once used in this protocol (see Strategic Planning)\n5. At this stage, handle the plates carefully to avoid mixing the cell suspensions.\n6. Allow the plates to dry for 20 min in a sterile biosafety cabinet.\n7. Seal the plates with Parafilm, invert, and incubate at 30°C for 48 hr. Colonies will be visible in each spot after 48 hr.\nGrow yeast plates according to the desired treatment conditions and duration if needed (e.g., for protein-protein interactions that occur only when exposed to particular wavelengths of light or in presence of modifiers).\nHarvesting and processing the yeast cells\n8. Prepare one labeled 1.5-ml tube per biological replicate (three tubes per sample) to be harvested, each with 1 ml of Z-buffer.\n9. Prepare another set of labeled 1.5-ml tubes (one per biological replicate; 3 tubes per sample) with 950 μl of double-distilled water, for measuring the OD600.",
    "10. Clean the London forceps with 80% ethanol and wipe with a paper towel. Scrape the cells from all 10 spots that belong to each biological replicate from the square plate and combine them by resuspending in the respective labeled 1.5-ml tube containing 1 ml of Z-buffer. Mix the cells by vortexing for 3 s.\n11. After collecting each biological replicate, clean the forceps with 80% ethanol and wipe with a paper towel.\n12. Transfer 50 μl from each tube into the corresponding 1.5-ml tube containing 950 μl of double-distilled water. Mix thoroughly. Measure the OD600 using a spectrophotometer.\nVortex the tubes with cell suspensions in between, to prevent the cells from settling at the bottom.\n13. Based on the results from OD600 measurements, prepare a yeast suspension of OD600 = 5.0 in a total volume of 2 ml of Z-buffer, using the following formula:\n         formula:\n\\begin{equation*} \\hspace*{-13.9pc}Vc = \\;\\frac{{{{\\bm {Vf}}}*ODf}}{{ODM*DF}}\\quad \\quad Vz = \\;2 - Vc \\end{equation*}\nVc = Volume yeast cells (ml)\nVf (Final volume) = 2 ml\nVz = Volume of Z-buffer (ml)\nODf (Final OD600) = 5\nODM = Measured OD600 of the 1:20 diluted yeast suspension (step 11)\nDF (dilution factor) = 20\nVf can be changed while scaling up or down. Use a higher DF, if the cell suspension obtained from step 10 needs to be diluted more to fit into the linear detection range of the spectrophotometer. Likewise, the ODf can be changed according to the interaction strength and time required for color development (see the following section). In general, use higher ODf for weak interactions and lower ODf for strong interactions.\nExample calculation: If the ODM of the 1/10 dilution is 0.8, Vc will be 625 μl and Vz will be 1.375 ml.",
    "14. Centrifuge the samples 10 min at 5000 × g, room temperature.\nDo not centrifuge higher than 5000 × g to prevent yeast cells from bursting at this point.\n15. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant by pipetting. Resuspend cells in 100 μl of Z-buffer.\nMake sure to pipette up and down thoroughly to resuspend the yeast cells that may adhere to the sides of the tubes.\n16. Snap-freeze the samples in liquid nitrogen. At this point, the samples can be stored at −80°C for a maximum period of 2 weeks, or immediately used for the quantitative X-gal assay.\nQuantitative X-gal assay\n17. Thaw the samples at 30°C in a heat block or water bath. Then re-freeze directly in liquid nitrogen. Repeat the freeze-thaw cycles for two additional times, to permeabilize the cells.\n18. Prepare two technical replicates for each biological replicate. For each technical replicate, pipette 50 μl of the lysate into one of the wells of a white 96-well plate (Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-fig-0002]).\nMake sure to thoroughly mix the lysate to distribute the cell debris uniformly among the technical replicates.\n19. Prepare two blank samples in two separate wells of the same 96-well plate, containing 50 μl of Z-buffer each.\n20. Prepare the X-gal master mix. The list below shows the reagents and amount needed for one well (one technical replicate) of the 96-well plate, with a total approximate volume of 330 μl/well. Prepare enough volume of the master mix to account for the total number of samples, including the biological replicates, technical replicates, and blank samples. Make sure to prepare an excess of 10% of the total volume of the master mix to account for pipetting errors.\n         \ntable:\n﻿0,1\nReagent,Amount per well\n0.5% Agarose in 1× PBS,0.2 ml\n1× PBS,0.13 ml\nβ-mercaptoethanol,0.2 μl\nX-gal,0.001 g",
    "To prepare the master mix:\n         \nAdd the required amounts of 1× PBS and X-gal powder to a 50-ml centrifuge tube. Vortex thoroughly to dissolve the X-gal.\nIf X-gal takes time to dissolve, the 50-ml tube can be attached to a rocker and shaken for 10-15 min.\nAdd the β-mercaptoethanol.\nUse a chemical safety cabinet while working with β-mercaptoethanol.\nHeat the 0.5% agarose in 1× PBS in a bottle until the agarose is fully melted. Cool the solution with constant stirring with a magnetic stirrer until the bottle can be handled with bare hands (no more than 55°C).\nAdd the warm 0.5% agarose in 1× PBS to the tube containing X-gal/ β-mercaptoethanol master mix. Vortex the tube vigorously for 30 s and immediately proceed to the next step.\nVortex the 50-ml tube several times in between, to prevent solidification of the master mix. Alternatively, depending on the assay and number of samples, the master mix can be prepared in a bottle with a magnetic stirrer and placed on a warm heating block with constant stirring. This may provide sufficient time for pipetting the master mix without solidification.\n21. Add 330 μl of the master mix to each well of the 96-well plate containing the yeast lysate or the blank samples. Record the starting time of the reaction. Mix the yeast lysate and the master mix thoroughly using a multichannel pipette.\nIf needed, a multi-dispenser pipette can be used to make the pipetting faster.",
    "In case of too many samples, handle up to 8 wells at a time using a multichannel pipette and mix well by pipetting up and down multiple times before proceeding to the next set of samples. This will ensure the equal distribution of X-gal within each well. Otherwise, patches of blue color will be formed that may affect the quantification.\nAs the quantitative X-gal assay takes many hours to finish, the short delays between the start of reactions in different wells would not cause significant differences in the final values.\n22. Wait for 10 min after finishing the last sample to ensure full solidification in all the wells. Cover the 96-well plate with a lid, seal using Parafilm, and incubate at room temperature and wait for blue color development.\n23. Check blue color development visually at regular intervals of approximately 30 to 60 min.\nIf the color develops too quickly (directly after adding the master mix), repeat the assay starting from harvesting and processing the cells, using a lower ODf (see step 13).\nDo not extend incubation until the negative control and blank samples turn blue. Incubation for too long may cause blue color formation everywhere, including the blank samples.\n24. Once the blue color appears on the interaction samples—but not on negative control or blanks—record the reaction time elapsed.\nDo not wait until the blue color starts to develop in the negative controls or the blank.\n25. Open the plates and scan using a smartphone or DSLR camera. Make sure to avoid the reflection of light or flash, as it may affect quantification.",
    "Check the image carefully for shiny spots caused by reflection from the flash of the camera. If needed, take several pictures or scans to ensure that an appropriate reaction stage is captured in at least one of the pictures.\n26. Take pictures of the plates at different time points, while recording the time elapsed.\nMake sure to take several pictures at each time point. Close the plate with the lid after each time a picture is taken, and continue to incubate at room temperature.\nWhen performing a quantitative interaction assay, it is necessary to make sure that the measurements are within the linear range of the assay. To this end, a regression curve needs to be prepared, for which pictures at different time points are required.\n27.

    "This protocol describes the steps involved in quantifying protein-protein interaction strength using ONPG as a substrate of β-gal. We have included this protocol to demonstrate the increased sensitivity of the quantitative X-gal assay (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0004]) in detecting interactions, compared to the commonly used ONPG assay. In the presence of β-gal, ONPG is hydrolyzed to galactose and o-nitrophenol (Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-fig-0001]). The yellow color of o-nitrophenol can be measured spectrophotometrically. Note that the ONPG assay cannot be used in yeast strains with low LacZ activity, such as AH109.\nMaterials\nMaster plates containing co-transformed yeast, from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0001] or Alternate Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0002]\nZ-buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-rec-0013])\nZ-buffer + β-mercaptoethanol (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-rec-0014])\nZ-buffer + ONPG (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-rec-0015])\nLiquid nitrogen\n1 M Na2CO3 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-rec-0005])\nSterile double-distilled water\n80% v/v ethanol (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-rec-0002])\nSD/–LW 92-mm-diameter agar plates (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-rec-0008]; Sarstedt, cat. no. 82.1473.001)\nBiosafety cabinet (e.g., Kojair® BioWizard Silver Line Biosafety cabinet)\nSterile 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (e.g., Sarstedt, cat. no. 72.690.001)\nHeat block/water bath (at 30°C)\nCentrifuge 5810 R (Eppendorf or equivalent)\n50-ml polycarbonate centrifuge tubes (Sarstedt, cat. no. 62.547.254 or equivalent)\nMulti-dispenser pipette (Eppendorf Multipipette® M4 or equivalent)\nVortex mixer (VWR, Vortex VV3, cat. no. 444-007 or equivalent)\nPipettes (2.5 μl, 20 μl and 200 μl, 5 ml)\nSterile pipette tips\nMulti-channel pipette (Brand, Transferpipette® S-12, cat. no. 705932 or equivalent)\nShaking incubator at 30°C for tubes and plates (Infros-HT Ecotron or equivalent)\nWhite 96-well plate with lid (Greiner bio-one, cat. no. 655083 or equivalent)\n96-well flat transparent plate (Greiner Bio-One, cat. no. 675101 or equivalent suited to the plate reader)\nPlate reader (Tecan Lifesciences, Infinite® 200 PRO or equivalent)\nPlating transformed yeast cells on SD medium",
    "1. Prepare yeast plates with droplets following Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0004], steps 1 to 7, with the following exception: in step 1, use 1 ml of sterile water instead of 750 μl.\nHarvesting and processing of yeast cells\n2. Follow Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0004], steps 8 to 16, with the following exceptions:\n         \nIn step 8, prepare 1.5-ml tubes with 900 μl double-distilled water instead of 950 μl.\nIn step 13, calculate the final volume as 300 μl of yeast suspension with OD600 = 1.0, instead of a total volume of 2 ml with OD600 = 5.0.\nLiquid ONPG-assay\n3. Prepare all buffers freshly for the ONPG assay. Prepare enough Z-buffer + β-mercaptoethanol to have 700 μl per sample. Prepare enough Z-buffer + ONPG to have 160 μl per sample.\n4. Follow step 17 of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0004] to make the yeast cells permeable.\n5. Give the tubes a short spin in the tabletop centrifuge. Pipette 150 μl of each lysate into two new 1.5-ml tubes (technical replicates). Prepare a blank with 150 μl of Z-buffer.\n6. Add 700 μl of Z-buffer + β-mercaptoethanol to each tube, including the blank, using a multi-dispenser pipette.\n7. Add 160 μl Z-buffer + ONPG to each tube and the blank. Record the start time when adding Z-buffer + ONPG to the first tube.\n8. Incubate tubes at 30°C in an incubator with shaking until yellow color develops. Check once every 15-30 min for the appearance of the yellow color. Use the blank and negative controls against a white background to assess the intensity of the yellow color.\nFollow the guidelines in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.421#cpz1421-prot-0004], steps 23 and 24, regarding color development.",
    "9. Once color development is at an appropriate stage (the tubes with the POIs show yellow color, but not the negative controls), record the stop time and immediately stop the reaction by adding 400 μl of 1 M Na2CO3 to each tube. Determine the time elapsed (subtract the end time in minutes from the start time).\n10. Centrifuge the samples for 10 min at maximum speed in a tabletop centrifuge at room temperature to pellet the cell debris.\n11. Transfer 200 μl of the supernatant from each sample, including the blank, into a 96-well plate. Measure OD420 using a TECAN plate reader.\nTo be within the linear range, the OD should be below 2.0 when using the TECAN plate reader. If the values are too high, dilute samples with Z-buffer + β-mercaptoethanol. If TECAN is not available, transfer 1 ml each of the supernatants into cuvettes and use a spectrophotometer to measure the OD420 of the blank and the samples.\n12. Calculate β-galactosidase activity (Miller units) according to the following formula:\n         formula:\n\\begin{equation*} \\hspace*{-1.3pc}{\\bf{\\beta }} - {\\bf{galactosidase\\;activity\\;}}\\left( {{\\bf{Miller}}} \\right){\\bf{\\;units\\;}} = \\frac{{\\bf 1,000{\\bf{\\;*\\;OD}}\\bf 420}}{{{\\bf{t*V*OD}}\\bf 600}} \\end{equation*}\nOD420 = OD420 measured in step 11\nT = Time elapsed in minutes (from step 9)\nV = Volume of culture in ml = 0.15 ml (from step 5)\nOD600 (OD600 of culture; see step 2b) = 1"
