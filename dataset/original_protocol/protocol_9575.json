    "Patient blood samples were supplied by Longhua Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Medical University.The protocol follows the guidelines of Peking University Third Hospital's human research ethics committee. Informed consent was obtained from the patients for using the samples for research purposes.\n1. Pre-experiment to check the capture efficiency with cultured tumor cells\nCulture the tumor cells MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and HeLa for determining the capture efficiency. Dilute the tumor cell suspension, count the number of tumor cells, and repeat until the desired number of cells in 1 mL of PBS is obtained.\n\t\nCulture the cells in a cell culture flask with a starting cell number of ~ 1 x 105 cells in 1 mL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Incubate in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C with a 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nWhen the cell lines grow as adherent monolayers to 95% confluence, detach them from the culture dishes with 0.25% trypsin solution for 2 min as described in Chen et al.16.\nStain the tumor cells with calcein AM. Put 3 µL of calcein AM in the culture dish, and keep the dish in the incubator for 30 min. Then,digest all the cells with trypsin.\nCount the cultured tumor cells in PBS with a cell counting chamber, and dilute until 100 tumor cells per 1 mL of PBS are obtained.\n\t\tNOTE: In order to precisely enumerate cell number, take 50 µL of the obtained cell suspension to see whether the number of tumor cells in it is five or not with a microscope. Decide the volume of cell suspension that needs to be taken to obtain 100 tumor cells according to the actual number of tumor cells in 50 µL of cell suspension.",
    "Introduce the cell suspension containing 100 tumor cells per 1 mL of PBS into the microfluidic chip using a syringe with a syringe pump at varied flow rates of 0.5 mL/h, 1 mL/h, 2 mL/h, 3 mL/h, 4 mL/h, and 5 mL/h. Obtain the capture efficiency for the various flow rates, and determine the optimal flow rate.\n\t\nCount the number of tumor cells captured on the chip and flowing out from the outlet. Calculate the capture efficiency as below:\n\t\t​Capture efficiency = Number of cells captured/(Number of cells captured + number of cells flowing out) × 100%\nRepeat to obtain the capture efficiency for different numbers of tumor cells from 10 to 100 (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100).\nTest and validate the microfluidic chip for rare numbers of tumor cells. Inject these 10 sample suspensions into the microfluidic chips using a hollow needle made with a micropipette puller to aspirate 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 tumor cells diluted in 1 mL of PBS. Detect and enumerate the number of tumor cells for each sample after their capture on the chip.\n\tNOTE: The hollow needle is around 3 cm in length with a 1 mm external diameter.\nPerform clinical pre-experiment testing for tumor cells spiked into normal blood samples.\n\t\nStain the tumor cells with calcein AM, and then enumerate 100 tumor cells in 5 µL of PBS. Spike these cells into 1 mL of whole normal blood samples. Introduce these cells into the chip, and enumerate the number of tumor cells captured on the chip with green immunofluorescence. Perform in vivo enumeration on the chip as described above, and calculate the capture efficiency after capture.",
    "Repeat step 1.4.1 for nine additional concentrations of tumor cell numbers from 10 to 90 (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90).\nEnumerate 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 tumor cells as described in step 1.3 without staining, spike into 1 mL of whole normal blood, introduce these samples into the microfluidic chip, and capture the tumor cells on the chip.\nStain on the chip with Hoechst, CK-FITC, and CD45-PE. Put 3-5 µL of fluorescent dye into 20-30 µL of PBS, and then introduce this solution onto the microfluidic chip with a syringe. Enumerate the number of tumor cells captured on the chip with both blue and green immunofluorescence to determine the capture efficiency.\nPerform modification of the microfluidic chip for the affinity-based capture of anti-EpCAM.\n\tNOTE: Since the wave chip combines both affinity-based and physical property-based isolation, modify the chip with agents.\n\t\nModify the surface of the chip with 100 µL of 4% (v/v) 3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxysilane in ethanol at room temperature for 45 min. Introduce this solution into the chip carefully and slowly in case it destroys the internal structure of the chip, especially the bonding of the top surface and substrate glass.\n\t\tNOTE: The chip surface is modified using mercaptosilane. The interactions that occur on the chip are determined by chemical bonds. Chemical bonds are established to realize the bonding of the antibody modified with the antigen. Various reagents are modified inside the chip to establish chemical bonds that connect with each other. The last reagent to be modified is an anti-epithelial adhesion molecule (anti-EpCAM). The tumor cell surface antigen of EpCAM combines with anti-EpCAM inside the chip to realize the capture of the CTCs.",
    "Wash with ethanol 3x. Add 100 µL of the coupling agent N-y-maleimidobutyryloxy succinimide ester (GMBS, 1 µM) onto the chip, and allow it to interact for 30 min.\nWash with PBS 3x. Use a syringe to introduce 1 mL of PBS onto the chip to wash.\nTreat the chip with 30-40 µL of 10 µg/mL neutravidin at room temperature for 30 min, leading to immobilization of the cells onto the GMBS, and then flush with PBS to remove excess avidin.\nModify the chip with 3 µL of anti-biotinylated EpCAM antibody at a concentration of 10 µg/mL in 100 µL of PBS with 1% (w/v) BSA. Keep this overnight.\n2.

Collect whole blood samples in anticoagulation tubes. Add 6-9 mL of RBS lysis solution into 2-3 mL of blood. Centrifuge at 111 x g for 5-8 min at room temperature, and discard the upper layer of red clear liquid.\nCapture, stain, recognize, and enumerate the cells on the chip as described below.\n\t\nCapture the cells on the chip as described in step 1.Stain the chip for the CTCs captured using Hoechst, CK-FITC, and CD45-PE. CK-FITC is a specific stain for tumor cells, and CD45-PE is for white blood cells.\nAdd 3 µL of CK-FITC to 20 µL of PBS. Introduce this into the syringe, and pump the diluted CK-FITC onto the chip. Allow to stain for 30 min. Introduce 300 µL of PBS onto the chip to wash the chip.",

Introduce 300 µL of PBS onto the chip to wash the chip.\nIdentify the CTCs with an inverted fluorescence microscope at 20x or 40x magnification. CTCs emit both blue and green fluorescence, and white blood cells (WBCs) emit both blue and red fluorescence. Identify the CTCs with both blue and green fluorescence and the WBCs with both blue and red fluorescence.\nFrom the immunofluorescence images, enumerate the number of CTCs captured on the chip. Enumerate the CTCs as Hoechst+/CK-FITC+/CD45− and the WBCs as Hoechst+/CK-FITC−/CD45+.\nEnrich the captured CTCs by flushing with PBS through the syringe in the reverse direction onto the microfluidic chip to collect the CTCs captured on the chip from the inlet. Use a syringe with 1 mL of PBS, introduce it from the outlet to enrich the CTCs captured on the chip within 2-3 min, and collect them from the inlet. Use 1 mL of PBS for each washing step, and repeat 3x.\nStain the tumor cells or CTCs captured on the microfluidic chip as described below.\n\t\nStain using calcein AM. Add 5 µL of calcein AM to 20 µL of PBS, stain the cells for 30 min, then centrifuge at 111 x g for 2 min at room temperature to obtain tumor cells, and suspend in 1 mL of PBS.",
    "To identify the cellular nuclei, add 20 µL of DAPI solution (10 µL of DAPI reagent in 20 µL of PBS) to the chip at the optimal flow rate of 1 mL/h for big-ellipse microfilters and 1.5 mL/h for trapezoid ones. Pass through 20 µL of anti-cytokeratin stock solution (3 µL of anti-cytokeratin antibody in 20 µL of PBS) to react with the chip for 30 min.\nStain the WBCs captured on the chip. After the CTCs have been captured on the chip, add 25 µL of anti-CD45 antibody solution (5 µL of anti-CD45 solution in 20 µL of PBS) to the chip, and allow to stain for 30 min. Wash with PBS, and identify the epithelial cells with both blue and green fluorescence.\nPerform immunofluorescence identification with fluorescence microscopy as described below.\n\t\nUse a fluorescence microscope and excite the sample with the blue laser. Find the cells emitting blue fluorescence, which are nucleate cells. Use one of the following magnifications: 10x, 20x, or 40x. Find a clear field for the tumor cell. For the blue laser source, use an excitation plate wavelength of 420-485 nm and an emission plate wavelength of 515 nm.\nWithout moving the samples, use another laser source. Rotate the fluorescence microscope and excite the sample with the green laser. Find the cells emitting green fluorescence, which is indicative of tumor cells. Take images of the same field with the same magnification with this green laser source. The cells that emit both blue and green fluorescence are recognized as tumor cells. For the green laser source, use an excitation plate wavelength of 460-550 nm and an emission plate wavelength of 590 nm",
    "Without moving the samples, use another laser source. Rotate the fluorescence microscope and excite the sample with the red laser. Find the cells emitting red fluorescence. Take images of the same field with the same magnification with this red laser source.
