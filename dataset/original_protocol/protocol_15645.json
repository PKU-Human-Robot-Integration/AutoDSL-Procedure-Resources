    "The animal study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IACUC-PE-2022-06-002), and animal ethics review and animal protocol of Yunnan University (YNU20220149).\n1. Preparation of retinal explants\nObtain primate eyeballs from wild-type macaques, aged 1 to 3 years old, store in tissue storage solution, and transport on ice within 3 h of enucleation after the monkeys were sacrificed or after natural death.\nFor the preparation of proteinase K solution, dissolve 25 mg of proteinase K in 250 µL of distilled water, and then add 225 µL of the solution to 18.5 mL of basal medium (R16).\nWash the eyeballs in 10 mL of 5% povidone-iodine (povidone-iodine: water = 1:19) for 30 s and dip them into 5% penicillin/streptomycin (PEN/STREP):phosphate-buffered saline = 1:19 for 1 min to avoid bacterial contamination. Then, incubate the eyeballs in 10 mL of R16 medium for 5 min.\nPre-heat the proteinase K solution in a 37 °C incubator. Then, immerse the eyeballs in 10 mL of proteinase K solution and incubate for 2 min. Immerse the eyeballs in 10 mL of R16 + fetal bovine serum (1:1) solution, incubate for 5 min, and then transfer the eyeballs to 10 mL of fresh R16 for a final wash.\nSeparate out the sclera, cornea, iris, lens, and vitreous body, and cut the retina from 4 sides with tweezers and scissors (Figure 1A-L).\nCut retinal explants with trephine blades into five sections-a 4 mm trephine blade for the nasal/temporal/superior/inferior side and a 6 mm trephine blade for the central side (containing optic disk and macula; Figure 1M-O). Cut at the following distance from the optic nerve head: 1.5 mm for nasal, 4 mm for temporal, and 2 mm for both superior and inferior side.",
    "Transfer the retina explants (containing retina and choroid) with eyelid depressor and place them in the middle of the insert, photoreceptor side up (Figure 1P). Place approximately 1 mL of complete medium (R16 supplemented with BSA, transferrin, progesterone, insulin, T3, corticosterone, vitamin B1, vitamin B12, retinol, retinyl acetate, DL-tocopherol, tocopheryl acetate, linoleic acid, L-cysteine HCl, glutathione, glutamine, vitamin C) below the membrane on the plate to fully cover the retina.\n2. Primate retinal explant culture\nCulture retinal explants in complete medium and place in a 37 °C incubator aerated with humidified 5% CO2.\nApply drug treatment at appropriate concentration to the retinal culture medium (e.g., zaprinast at concentrations of 100 µM, 200 µM, or 400 µM). Use at least three explants per treatment condition and use explants without drug as control. Treat with drug for 4 days.\n3. Fixing and cryo-sectioning\nIncubate retinal explants with 1 mL of paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 45 min, rinse them briefly with 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and then incubate with 10% sucrose for 10 min, 20% sucrose for 20 min, and 30% sucrose for 30 min (1 mL for each retina explant).\nCut retinal explants using trephine blades to ensure consistency in the size of the explants obtained from different sites with the following characteristics: four quadrants in the periphery, 6 mm at the center. Then, transfer the retinal explants into a tinbox (about 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm) with O.C.T. embedding medium to cover the tissue. Immediately, freeze the tissue sections in liquid nitrogen and place in a -20 °C refrigerator for storage.",
    "Use a sharp blade to trim the agar into a small block containing the tissue sample, cut the sample blocks into 10 µm sections, and place them on adhesion microscope slides using a soft brush. Then, dry for 45 min at 40 °C and store at -20 °C until use.\n4. Immunohistochemistry (Figure 2)\ncGMP staining\n\t\nDry the slides and draw a hydrophobic ring around the retinal sections with a liquid blocker pen to cover the samples.\nImmerse slides in 200 µL of 0.3% phosphate buffer saline and Triton X-100 per slide (PBST) for 10 min at room temperature, and then in blocking solution (5% normal donkey serum, 0.3% PBST, 1% BSA, 200 µL per slide) for 1 h at room temperature.\nIncubate the samples overnight with the primary antibody (1:250, sheep anti-cGMP, 200 µL per slide) prepared in the blocking solution at 4 °C, and then rinse with PBS for 10 min (200 µL per slide) 3x.\nIncubate the samples with secondary antibody (1:300, Donkey anti sheep Alxea Fluor 488, 200 µL per slide) for 1 h at room temperature, and then rinse with PBS for 10 min, 3x. Cover the samples with an antifade mounting medium containing 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and store at 4 °C for at least 30 min before imaging.\nTUNEL staining\n\t\nDry the slides at room temperature for 15 min and draw a water-repellent barrier ring around retinal tissue specimens with the liquid blocker pen, and then incubate them in 40 mL of PBS for 15 min.\nIncubate slides in 42 mL (per five slides) of TBS (0.05 M Tris-buffer) at 37 °C. Aspirate out the TBS, and incubate the samples with 6 µL of proteinase K for 5 min. Then, wash slides 3x with TBS for 5 min each time.",
    "Expose the slides to 40 mL of ethanol-acetic acid solution in the choplin, cover with a transparent sheet, and incubate at -20 °C for 5 min. Wash the slides 3x with TBS for 5 min each time.\nExpose the slides to blocking solution (1% BSA; 200-300 µL per slide as per requirement) and incubate in a humidity chamber for 1 h.\nPrepare TUNEL kit solution, TMR red, in the following proportion: 62.50 µL of blocking solution (1% BSA), 56.25 µL of labeling solution (TMR-dUTP), and 6.25 µL of the enzyme (proportion for each slide). Add approximately 130 µL of this solution per slide and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h. Then, wash the slides with PBS for 5 min (200 µL per slide), 2x.\nPlace cover slides containing 1-2 drops of antifade mounting medium with DAPI over the samples, and then incubate the slides at 4 °C for at least 30 min before imaging.\ncGMP staining combined with TUNEL staining\n\t\ncGMP staining was followed by TUNEL staining. Follow the steps of TUNEL staining from step 4.2.1 to step 4.2.5, and then continue the steps of cGMP staining from step 4.1.2 to step 4.1.4.\nPerform light and fluorescence microscopy with camera parameters as follows: exposure time = 125 ms, ROI size = 2752 x 2208, Color = B/M. Capture images using the software. Picture four different fields with a digital camera at 20x magnification from each section and obtain representative pictures from the central areas of the retina using DAPI (465 nm), EGFP (509 nm), TMP (578 nm), with Z-Stack scanning having an interval = 1 µm and optional = 1.251 µm.\nSubscription Required.
