    "Platelet isolationThe mouse is placed under terminal anaesthesia by inhalation of isoflurane (2.5% with oxygen at medical grade).With a scalpel the abdomen is opened and the bowel pushed aside to expose the major abdominal vessels.A syringe with a needle (27 G) containing ACD buffer (150 µl/ml blood) is inserted into the vena cava above the renal veins to collect blood (Figure 1). Blood volume collected in this way is usually from 800-1,000 µl for a mouse of 20.0 g weight. After the collection of blood, the mouse was completely exsanguinated by transection of the vena cava.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170216/20170216212204_1396.jpgFigure 1. Blood collection from the vena cava in a mouse. A shows position of the vena  cava and B shows blood collection with a syringe containing ACD buffer.The blood should be anti-coagulated by rapid mixing with the ACD buffer during collection. The blood is then transferred to a 15 ml conical bottom polypropylene tube and mixed with washing buffer (3 ml/ml, 1 ml of 100 mmol/L EGTA [pH 6.8] and 2 ml of resuspension buffer).The tube is centrifuged at 180 x g at 22 °C for 10 min. This results in pelleting of the larger cellular elements such as red blood cells and leukocytes.Platelet-rich plasma is collected and transferred to a 15 ml conical bottom polypropylene tube. The pellet discarded. The washing buffer detailed in step A4 now with the addition of prostaglandin E1 (0.25 µmol/L) is added to yield a total volume of 10 ml. The mixture was gently pipetted 3-5 times with a 5 ml pipette. The prostaglandin is essential at this point to prevent platelet activation. The tube is centrifuged at 1,250 x g and 22 °C for 10 min.The pellet now consists mainly of platelets.",
    "Remove the supernatant and wash two more times using the buffer in step A6 with prostaglandin and centrifuge as in step A7.  After suspension at this point in 10 ml of washing buffer including 0.25 µmol/L prostaglandin E1 the platelets can be counted.   To count the platelets, mix the platelet suspension (15 µl) and undiluted prostaglandin E1 (5 µl, 500 µM). Counting can be done in a Coulter counter. Note that the counter must be adjusted for the size of mouse platelets. The diameter of the mouse platelet is approximately 0.5 µm, which is smaller than human platelets (1-2 µm).At this point the platelets can be used for experimentation remembering that until an experiment is initiated, it is important to block activation with 0.25 µmol/L prostaglandin E1. This will then need to be removed- often by dilution- to assess platelet action.Platelet stainingWe have used the vital dye PKH26 to fluorescently tag the collected platelets following the manufacturer’s directions with some modifications. At this point the platelets from step A9 can be centrifuged as in A7. They should be resuspended in 1 ml of Diluent C (PKH26 Kit) to be 8 x 105/µl with added 0.25 µmol/L prostaglandin E1. Prepare a stock solution of PKH26 (1 mM) by dilution of PKH26 dye solution in 100% ethanol.Add 2 µl of both PKH26 and prostaglandin E1 (2.5 µg/ml) into 1 ml of platelet suspension.Immediately mix the sample by gentle pipetting.Incubate the sample at 22 °C for 10 min.The staining reaction is stopped by addition of 10 ml of a mixture of citrate-albumin buffer, 0.35% bovine serum albumin (pH 6.5) and 0.25 µmol/L prostaglandin E1. Incubate the mixture at 22 °C for 1 min. Pellet the platelets by centrifugation at 1,250 x g at 22 °C for 20 min.",
    "Remove the supernatant and resuspend the platelets at 6 x 106/µl in the resuspension buffer for use (as described in Recipe 4).For in vivo experiments, 100 µl of platelet suspended solution can be injected with a 1 ml syringe a needle (27 G) into the mouse tail vein. We find that the number of platelets harvested in this way from 5 mice usually supplies enough for in vivo injections into 3 mice. The resultant reconstitution usually results in approximately 50% of the platelets being newly introduced and fluorescent. They remain functional for at least 24 h. We have not looked in detail after that time, but in principle a longer time span should be possible."
