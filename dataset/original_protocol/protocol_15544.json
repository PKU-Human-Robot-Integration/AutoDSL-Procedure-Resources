    "NOTE: This protocol has two main steps: a wet lab step, involving cell culture and live confocal microscopy to obtain images of live mitochondria (Figure 1) and an in silico step to analyze obtained images (Figure 2). For automated data analysis of 3D live imaged mitochondria, the MATLAB application Mitometer was used as provided by Lefebvre et al.9. The Routine optimization is written in MATLAB. The software, updated versions and processing ImageJ Macros are freely available online through GitHub, at https://github.com/JoseJoaoMV/Routine_Optimization_Mitometer_APP_MATLAB. \n1. Live microscopy\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65452/65452fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Experimental protocol. SH-SY5Y cells were differentiated and treated with retinoids. (A) TMRM was used to live image healthy mitochondria in treated cells using a confocal microscope, capturing a time lapse z-stack of five visual fields. (B) Mitometer application MATLAB automatically segments and analyzes mitochondria images. In addition to analyzing, this software automatically discriminates mitochondria according to nuclear proximity. Blue dots are mitochondrial initial positions; red dots are final positions. Scale bar = 30 µm. Abbreviation: TMRM = tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester.

    "Wash cells with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and treat for 72 h with 10-7 M RAR-isoform agonists, in equal parts of MEM (Minimal Essential Medium) and F12 (Ham's F12 Nutrient Mix) Medium, supplemented with 1% FBS.\n\t\tNOTE: The RARα agonist used was AM580; RARβ agonist used was CD2314; Ch55 was used as agonist as RARα and β co-agonist; atRA was used as a positive control; BMS493 was used as a RAR pan-antagonist.\nLive confocal imaging\n\t\nReplace culture medium with fresh 1% FBS-containing culture medium with 20 nM tetramethylrhodamine, methyl ester (TMRM) for 45 min.\n\t\tNOTE: TMRM is a cell-permeant fluorescent dye, sequestered by active mitochondria, and this incubation period allows TMRM to reach an equilibrium and be taken up by polarized mitochondria11. Imaging should be started before equilibrium is established as TMRM signal intensity could artificially increase during imaging.\nPlace the cells in an incubator attached to a laser-scanning confocal microscope at 37 °C.\nCapture images using a 63x oil-immersion apochromat objective, with an image size of 512 x 512 pixels obtained with a pinhole aperture of 1 airy unit, capturing a time series of 15 frames from five different visual fields in each cell plate, and a z-stack of 8 equidistant z-planes. The resulting .lsm file is a time-, position-, and z-stack.\n\t\tNOTE: Settings for gain, contrast, and brightness must be initially optimized using the minimum laser power necessary to use the entire dynamic range of the detector and kept constant throughout the study, ensuring that all imaging is performed under the same conditions. Up to nine different positions can be recorded in this hardware-software combination and the microscope cycles between imaging positions automatically.\n2.

(D) Routine optimization result validation: representative image of mitochondria in untreated cells (left panel), treated with atRA (10-7 M, 72 h, middle panel), and treated with RAR antagonist BMS493 (10-7 M, 72 h, right panel), imaged after incubation with TMRM (20 nM, 45 min incubation). Scale bar = 30 µm. (E) TMRM Intensity in cell body mitochondria. Significant decrease with all-trans retinoic acid treatment (atRA, 10-7 M, 72 h), compared with control (p=0,0062), not observed when treated with RAR antagonist (BMS493, 10-7 M, 72 hours). Five cells were quantified from each of three repetitions per condition.
