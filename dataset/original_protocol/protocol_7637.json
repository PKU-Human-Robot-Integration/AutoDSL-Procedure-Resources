    "Lipid preparation Important: work in a laminar flow hood when working with chloroform and argon gas. Fill round-bottom glass tubes with argon gas.Transfer 20 μL of Egg PE, Heart CL, Egg PA, Egg PG, and Egg PC chloroform solutions and 50 μL of Brain PI(4)P chloroform solution (all stored at -20 °C under argon gas) to a separate argon gas–filled round-bottom glass tube. If lipid combinations are to be tested, it is possible to dry the lipids in the same round-bottom tube in the desired amounts. This reduces the detergent concentration in the protein–lipid mix.Dry the lipids under an argon stream and shake on a pulsing vortex mixer for 15 min.Re-suspend dry lipids to 5 μM under shaking, depending on their average molecular weight:Egg PE (MW: 746 Da) in 54 μL of 0.25% LMNG.Heart CL (MW: 1494 Da) 27 μL of 0.25% LMNG.Egg PA (MW: 711 Da) 57 μL of 0.25% LMNG.Egg PC (MW: 770 Da) 52 μL of 0.25% LMNG.Egg PG (MW: 782) 51 μL of 0.25% LMNG.Brain PI(4)P (MW: 974) 10 μL of 0.25% LMNG.Add 1.8 μL of the 5 μM lipid solution to 50 μL of 32 μM purified MARCH5 (1 mg/mL) in 100 mM NaCl; 50 mM Tris pH 7.7; 5% glycerol; 0.001% LMNG; 0.1 mM TCEP (MARCH5 is incubated with the different lipids in a 1:10 molar ratio).Incubate the lipid–protein solution on ice for 1 h.The protein is now considered ready for activity and/or stability measurements.Note: Generate lipid stocks that take the lipid:detergent ratio into consideration in the final assay conditions. Thus, the lipid stocks might have to be adjusted to keep the reaction mixture volumes equal, while still keeping the final critical micelle concentration (CMC) equivalent throughout the assay. This can be done by adjusting the detergent:lipid ratios already in the stock solution.",
    "However, this also limits the maximal detergent:lipid ratio that can be tested in solution. Lipid-binding assay (Figure 1A) Cut a rectangle (2 cm × 6 cm) of the PVDF membrane.Spot 1 μL of the chloroform solutions of Egg PE, Heart CL, Egg PA, Egg PC, Egg PG, and Brain PI(4)P on the PVDF membrane at approximately 1 cm of distance.Dry the spotted lipid for 1 h at room temperature (RT) in a laminar flow hood.Spot positive controls on the dry membrane lipid strip:Spot 1 μL of Anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked antibody on the membrane lipid strip.Spot 1 μL of 0.35 mg/mL target protein.Dry positive controls for 15 min.Block the PVDF membrane with 30 mL of TBS supplemented with 3% BSA overnight at 4 °C with soft agitation on a plate shaker.Remove the blocking solution.Add 10 mL of 1 μg/mL of MARCH5 in TBS supplemented with 0.001% LMNG and 3% BSA (1 CMC of LMNG is added to ensure MARCH5 will not precipitate during incubation) to the PVDF membrane.Incubate the PVDF membrane and MARCH5 for 4 h at 4 °C with soft agitation on a plate shaker.Wash the PVDF membrane three times with 5 mL of TBS supplemented with 0.001% LMNG for 5 min at RT under soft agitation.Add 5 mL of Anti-MARCH5 antibody N-terminal in TBS supplemented with 0.001% LMNG and 3% BSA to the PVDF membrane.Incubate anti-MARCH5 antibody N-terminal for 4 h at 4 °C.Remove the antibody solution and rinse the PVDF with 5 mL of TBS supplemented with 0.001% LMNG.Add anti-rabbit IgG, HRP-linked Antibody in 5 mL of TBS supplemented with 0.001% LMNG and 3% BSA to the PVDF membrane.Wash again the membrane lipid strip three times in 5 mL of TBS supplemented with 0.001% LMNG for 5 min at RT under soft agitation.",
    "Prepare PierceTM ECL western blotting substrate, add onto the membrane lipid strip, and incubate for 1 min.Measure chemiluminescence using the ChemiDocTM Touch Gel imaging system (Figure 1B and 1C).Note: This assay will give you a yes/no answer on lipid membrane protein binding (see Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20231101/20231101194700_5982.jpgFigure 1. Lipid binding assay. A. Schematic overview of lipid binding assay. B. Example of positive hits. Cardiolipin and PI4P interact with the protein of interest, indicated by the dark dots. The protein of interest spotted in the left-right corner is a positive control (+ cntl). C. Example of no lipid-protein interaction. The positive control (+ cntl) shows a positive signal indicating that the assay has worked properly."
