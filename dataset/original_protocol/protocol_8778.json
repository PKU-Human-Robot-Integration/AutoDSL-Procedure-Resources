  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: All procedures were carried out in compliance with The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Arizona. A list of recommended materials and equipment can be found in Table 1.\n1. Tissue Preparation\nPerfusion\n\t\nEuthanize rodent with an overdose of sodium pentobarbital (25 mg/kg, IP), and perfuse transcardially with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) until completely exsanguinated (3-5 min) at a flow rate of 8 ml/min. For in-depth perfusion instructions, see Gage et al 20129.\nImmediately following PBS flush, fix tissue by perfusing with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15-20 min at a flow rate of 8 ml/min.\nRemove brain and place in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hr, followed by graded sucrose solutions (15%, 30%, 30%, in sequence; prepared in tris buffered saline) at 4 °C. Transfer the brain to the subsequent sucrose solution only after the brain has sunk in each solution. Note: Usually, 5 days in each solution is sufficient time for tissue to sink.\nTissue Freezing and Cryosectioning\n\t\nPlace the brain in embedding medium, such as O.C.T. compound and submerge in isopentane at a temperature of -35 °C. Allow the brain to freeze for a minimum of 10 min, and then store at -80 °C. Problems can arise if diligence to temperature is not taken; please see discussion for troubleshooting information.\nCut serial coronal sections at a thickness of 20 µm and a temperature of -20 °C. Collect tissue onto positively charged slides. Brain sections may be placed in a slide box wrapped in foil in a zip-top bag and stored long-term at -80 °C. This method of storage creates a double boundary to prevent exposure to air and frost.\n2. Tissue Processing",
    "NOTE: Example equipment and materials required for staining are shown in Figure 3. Alternatives are available, however, these images will aid those new to immunohistochemical staining to visualize appropriate items prior to purchasing.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52293/52293fig3highres.jpg\nFigure 3: Example items required for immunohistochemical staining. The black box shown in (A) is an ideal humidity chamber for immunofluorescence, as slides are protected from light without the need to wrap the box on foil. Following sectioning, slides can be stored in a box such as the yellow box shown in (B). Wrapping the box tightly in foil and placing in a zip-top bag prior to the freezer helps protect the tissue samples from freezer burn. An example of slides is given in (C), with different staining dishes depicted in (D) and (E). Coverslips can vary in size and thickness (F), however 1.2 thick coverslips provide nice imaging results on most upright and confocal microscopes. A pencil such as that shown in (G) can be used to label slides. Permanent markers should be avoided as the ink can run, affecting both staining and the ability to determine what the sample is. A mini pap pen such as that shown in (H) enables a repellent border to be drawn on slides.\nSlide preparation\n\t\nRemove slides from freezer and thaw at room temperature.\n\t\t\nOptional: If sections have previously floated from slides, place thawed slides in an oven at 60 °C for no more than 4 hrs to help prevent tissue sections from floating off slides.\nPlace slides in a slide rack and corresponding dish.",
    "Wash slides three times in PBS for 5 min each, changing solution between washes. From this step forward, avoid having sections without liquid for extended periods of time. Note: If sections dry out, background staining is increased and meaningful data cannot reliably be obtained.\nTissue Staining\n\t\nIn a light-tight staining box, create a “humidity chamber” with lint-free tissues soaked with deionized water.\nDry the edges of the slide with a lint-free tissue, use a mini pap pen to make a liquid repellent border at the very edge of the slide, away from tissue sections. This border should ensure ample space between the meniscus of the liquid and the edge of the tissue so that surface tension does not affect staining.\n\t\tNOTE: The pap pen repellent border can be applied prior to 2.1.3 if the antibodies of interest do not require microwave antigen retrieval. If the pap pen has been applied prior to washing in PBS, the integrity of the liquid-repellent border must be checked at this step. Use a mini-pap pen to fill in any gaps in the border.\nWith slides laid horizontally, block nonspecific antigen binding by incubating in 4% v/v serum in PBS (block solution). Pipette 300 µl of block solution per slide for 1hr at room temperature. Make sure the block solution extends to the pap pen at the edge of the slide and completely covers the tissue to avoid uneven staining caused by surface tension near the tissue.\n\t\t\nUse serum from the same species in which secondary antibody is made. Note: In this procedure, the secondary antibodies are made in donkey, and thus donkey serum is used. If secondary antibodies from two or more different species are used, include serum from each species.",
    "Pipette primary antibody onto slides. Note: Antibody concentrations for this staining have been optimized at 1:5,000 and 1:500 for Iba1 and Pan-neuronal, respectively. These concentrations have been found to show meaningful staining with an absence of background staining.\n\t\t\nDilute block solution to 1% serum in PBS and add primary antibodies. Pipette 300 µl of primary antibody solution in 1% serum per slide. Again, ensure the fluid is to the edge of the pap pen. Incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nInclude three control slides: one that contains neither Iba1 nor Pan-neuronal antibodies, one with Iba1 without Pan-neuronal antibody, and one with Pan-neuronal antibody without Iba1. Stain these slides in the same run with the same solutions, however omit the primary antibodies to test the non-specific binding of the secondary antibodies.\nThe following morning, wash slides three times in PBS for 5 min each, changing solution between washes.\nFluorescent antibodies are light-sensitive, therefore, from this step forward, minimize light exposure by ensuring wash containers are wrapped in foil and hybridization boxes are either black or incubated in the dark. Pipette the appropriate secondary antibodies on all slides and incubate for 60 min at room temperature at a concentration of 1:250 in block solution (see step 2.2.3) in a light-tight “humidity chamber” (see step 2.2.1).\n\t\t\nUse secondary antibodies of different wavelengths. Here, for the primary antibody rabbit anti-Iba1, use donkey anti- rabbit 594 as the appropriate secondary antibody. For the primary antibody mouse anti-Pan-neuronal, use donkey anti-mouse 488 as the appropriate secondary antibody. Alternately, use anti-rabbit 488 and anti-mouse 594.\nWash slides three times in PBS for 5 min each.\nOptional: perform nuclear staining.\n\t\t\nPlace in Hoechst (or other nuclear stain) at a concentration of 0.03 µg/ml in double distilled H20 for exactly 60 sec.",
    "Wash slides three times in PBS for 5 min each.\nWash in ddH20.\nCoverslipping\n\t\nCoverslip slides with an aqueous mounting medium, such as Fluoromount-G or ProlongGold. Take care to remove all bubbles using a cotton-tipped applicator.\n\t\tNote: Other mounting agents could be used, however high bleed-through between dyes has been noted by some within days of coverslipping.\nUse clear nail polish to seal the edges, preventing the sections from drying out due to evaporation. Allow nail polish to dry in a light-tight container while slides remain flat and at room temperature, and then store in a light-tight container wrapped in foil at 4 °C.\n3. Imaging the Stained Tissue\nMicroscopy\n\t\nAllow the nail polish to dry for at least one hour before commencing microscopy, which should take place in a darkened room.\nAcquire photomicrographs using a confocal or research microscope with a fluorescent light source and a digital camera attachment. Using the accompanying software, set the exposure for each wavelength – 405, 488, and 594 – separately. Note: in-depth imaging instructions should be available online from the microscope manufacturer.\nAcquire photomicrographs in each channel without moving the sections or adjusting the focus. Take images in color, or alternately in grayscale and convert to color afterward.\n\t\tNote: Color or grayscale images from each channel can be collated in post-processing.\nEnsure that tissue sections are not exposed to ambient light or microscopic light for long periods of time, as photo-bleaching of the sections will occur. To avoid this, increase exposure time rather than increasing light/laser intensity.\nDo not turn off the fluorescent light source within 30 min of being turned on.\n\t\tNote: Switching the source on and off in quick succession may decrease the life span of the fluorescent bulb.\nSubscription Required.
