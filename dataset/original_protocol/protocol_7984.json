    "This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Institute of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (reference number D2018-09-29-1). All procedures were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., 1996). Twelve adult Sprague-Dawley male rats (weight 220 ± 20 g) were used in this study. Animals [license number SCXK (JING) 2017-0005] were provided by the National Institutes for Food and Drug Control.\n1. Innervation of rat cranial dura mater\nPerfusions\nIntraperitoneally inject an overdose of tribromoethanol solution (250 mg/kg) to the rat to induce euthanasia.\nOnce the breath stops, transcardially perfuse with 100 mL of 0.9% normal saline followed by 250-300 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.4).\nAfter perfusion, remove the head skin and open the skull to expose the dura mater and dorsal side of the brain. Then dissect out the cranial dura mater along the brainstem to the olfactory bulb in the whole-mount pattern (Figure 1). Perform post-fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h, and then cryoprotect in 25% sucrose in 0.1 M PB for more than 24 h at 4 °C.\nFluorescence immunohistochemistry for CGRP and phalloidin labeling\n\tNOTE: A combination of fluorescent staining of CGRP and phalloidin was applied to reveal the spatial correlation of dural nerve fibers and blood vessels in the rat cranial dura mater in the whole-mount pattern.\n\t\nRinse the cranial dura mater in 0.1 M PB for about 1 min.\nIncubate the dura mater in a blocking solution containing 3% normal donkey serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PB for 30 min.",
    "Transfer the dura mater into mouse anti-CGRP antibody (1:1000) in 0.1 M PB containing 1% normal donkey serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C11.\nWash the dura mater three times in 0.1 M PB the following day.\nIncubate the dura mater in a mixed solution of donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (1:500) and phalloidin 568 (1:1000) in 0.1 M PB containing 1% normal donkey serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1.5 h at room temperature (26 °C).\nWash the dura mater three times in 0.1 M PB.\nTrim the edges and mount it on microscope slides (see Table of Materials).\nPut on coverslips with 50% glycerin before observation.\nObservation and recording\nObserve the fluorescent samples under a fluorescent microscope or a confocal imaging system.\nTake the images of the whole-mount dura mater by a fluorescent microscope equipped with a digital camera (4x, NA: 0.13), and use an exposure time of 500 ms. The image mosaics of the dura mater were completed with a software of fluorescent microscope (see Table of Materials).\nTake images of the CGRP-immunoreactive nerve fibers and phalloidin-labeled blood vessels in the dura mater using a confocal microscope. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 nm (green) and 594 nm (red). The confocal pinhole is 110 (20x) and 105 µm (40x). The resolution of image capture is 640 x 640 pixels.\nCapture 20 images in 2 µm frames of from each 40 µm thick section and perform single in-focus image integration with a confocal image processing associated software system for 3D analysis as follows: Set Start Focal Plane | Set End focal plane | Set step size | Choose Depth Pattern | Image Capture | Z series.",
    "Use a photo editing software to adjust the brightness and contrast of images to optimize the visualization. Pay attention to not remove any data from the images.\n2. Retrograde tracing study with FG\nSurgical procedures\nDetermine the coordinate area of interest in rat cranial dura mater.\nPrepare a 10 µL micro-syringe and test it with liquid paraffin.\nAnesthetize the rats with tribromoethanol solution (150 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Check for the depth in anesthesia by the lack of response to toe pinch.\nShave the rat's head with an electric razor.\nPut blunt ear bars to the rat and place it on the stereotaxic device. Then put the mouth holder and apply ophthalmic ointment on the eyes.\nClean the surgical site of the head skin using 10% povidone iodine followed by 75% ethanol.\nMake an incision along the midline of the scalp.\nBluntly remove the periosteum and muscle tissues away from the skull using sterile cotton-tipped applicators (Figure 1A).\nDrill a small hole (~5-7 mm) using a burr drill with a round-tip bit (#106) on the left parietal and temporal bones above the MMA12, and make sure that the cranial dura mater was kept intact (Figure 1B).\nBuild a bank around the hole with dental silicate cement to limit the spread of the tracer (Figure 1C).\nAdd 2 µL of 2% FG into the hole around MMA with a 10 µL micro-syringe (Figure 1D).\nCover the hole with a small piece of hemostatic sponge.\nPut a piece of paraffin film on the hole and seal the edges with bone wax to prevent the leakage of tracer and to avoid contaminating to the surrounding tissues.\nSuture the wound with sterile thread.\nKeep the rats in a warm area until they have fully recovered.",
    "Return the rats back to their cages and add an antibiotic and analgesic into the drinking water.\nPerfusions and sections\nAfter 7 survival days, perfuse these rats as mentioned above in the procedures in section 1.1.\nDissect out the TG and C1-4 DRGs, then post-fix and cryoprotect them as above mentioned in section 1.1.3 (Figure 1F).\nCut the TG and DRGs at the thickness of 30 µm on a cryostat microtome system in the sagittal direction and mounted on silane-coated glass slides.\nDouble immunofluorescences for FG- and CGRP-labeling in the TG and DRGs\n\tNOTE: Although the FG-labeling can be directly observed with UV illumination under mercury lamp without additional staining13,14,15,16, the labeled neurons with FG were further examined in TG and cervical DRGs using double immunofluorescences with FG and CGRP for revealing the origins of dural CGRP-immunoreactive nerve fibers in the TG and DRGs.\n\t\nCircle the sections with the histochemical pen.\nIncubate the sections for 30 min in a blocking solution containing 3% normal donkey serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PB.\nTransfer the samples into the solution of rabbit anti-fluorogold (1:1000) and mouse anti-CGRP antibody (1:1000) in 0.1 M PB containing 1% normal donkey serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the sections three times in 0.1 M PB the following day.\nIncubate in a mixed solution of donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (1:500) and donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500) secondary antibody in 0.1 M PB containing 1% normal donkey serum and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1.5 h at room temperature.\nWash and apply coverslips to the sections as the procedures in steps 1.2.6 and 1.2.8.\nObservation and recording\nTake images of the FG-labeled neurons in TG and DRGs under UV illumination by fluorescent microscope equipped with a digital camera.",
