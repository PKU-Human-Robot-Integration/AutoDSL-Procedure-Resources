    "The experiments were conducted according to the recommendations of the Declarations of Helsinki and Tokyo and to the Guidelines for the Use of Experimental Animals of the European Community. The experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.\nNOTE: The CCl4 model has been generated and used in a previous study17. The protocol timeline is demonstrated in Table 1.\n1. Preparing rats for the experimental procedure\nNOTE: Select adult male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 300−350 g.\nObtain approval for experiments from Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\nMaintain rats at room temperature (22 °C ± 1 °C), with 12 h light and 12 h dark cycles. Provide rat chow and water ad libitum.\nPerform all experiments between 6:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.\nShave the rat and disinfect the skin with alcohol.\n2. Determination of serum GOT, GPT, and TB baseline levels\nAnesthesia\n\t\nPrepare a continuous isoflurane administration system to induce anesthesia. Make sure the vaporizer system is filled with isoflurane.\nAnesthetize the rat with 2% isoflurane. Confirm that the rat is fully anesthetized by observing the movement and pedal reflex in response to external stimuli.\n\t\tNOTE: Use 1−5% isoflurane for anesthesia induction and maintenance.\nCannulate the tail vein with a 22 G catheter.\nCollect a 0.5 mL blood sample at baseline. Ensure that the blood volume retrieved does not exceed IACUC guidelines.\nPerform blood biochemical analysis including the measurements of serum GOT, GPT and TB, as previously described18.\n\tNOTE: Examinations of liver enzymes and TB level were carried out in the biochemical laboratory of Soroka Medical Center. Blood samples were analyzed using a fluorescence method on a chemistry analyzer (Table of Materials).\n3. Induction of acute liver injury in rats",
    "CAUTION: Exposure to high concentrations of CCl4, including absorption through vapor or skin, can have negative effects on the central nervous system and cause degeneration of the liver and kidneys. Prolonged exposure can cause coma or death.\nPrepare a 50% solution of CCl4 (Table of Materials) by mixing CCl4 with olive oil as a vehicle in a 1:1 ratio.\n\tNOTE: The solution should be prepared according to IACUC guidelines for non-pharmaceutical grade compounds.\nInduce hepatotoxicity in vivo by CCl4 administration via an orogastric tube.\n\t\nInsert a 16 G orogastric tube (3 inches deep) through the oral cavity of the rat.\nExpose the rat to different doses of CCl4 by injecting a syringe with one of the following diluted solutions into the rat’s stomach: 1 mL/kg (mild ALI), 2.5 mL/kg (moderate ALI), or 5 mL/kg (severe ALI) of the 50% solution. For the sham-operated control group, expose the rat to 5 mL/kg olive oil only.\n4. Determination of serum GOT, GPT, and TB levels after 24 h\nAnesthesia\n\t\nPrepare a continuous isoflurane administration system to induce anesthesia. Make sure the vaporizer system is filled with isoflurane.\nAnesthetize the rats with 2% isoflurane. Confirm that the rat is fully anesthetized by observing the movement and pedal reflex in response to external stimuli.\nCollect blood samples at 24 h from CCl4 exposure.\nPerform blood biochemical analysis including measurements of serum GOT, GPT and TB.\n5. Liver collection for histological examination\nEuthanize the rat by replacing the inspired gas mixture with 20% O2/80% CO2. Ensure that CO2 is delivered at a predetermined rate in accordance with IACUC guidelines.\nEnsure death by checking for lack of heartbeat and confirm by a secondary method in accordance with IACUC guidelines.",
    "Place the rat on a dissecting board with its dorsal surface facing down and abdomen facing up. Shave the abdomen of the rat.\nWith a scalpel, incise the full length of the ventrum skin from the anus to the chin. Separate the skin. Incise the abdominal wall with a scalpel from the anus to the xyphoid cartilage, exposing the abdominal viscera.\nUsing scissors and forceps, isolate the liver by dissecting it from its ligaments and attachments. Starting at the liver hilum, carefully perform a hepatectomy by releasing all the liver lobes from attachments. Dissect and cut away all ligaments and blood vessels.\nTransfer the liver into a Petri dish. Fix the liver in a 4% buffered formaldehyde solution (Table of Materials) for at least 24 h.\n6. Histological examination\nSample preparation\n\t\nAfter fixation, cut the sample into 5 μm thick slice series by microtome sectioning.\nGently place the slices on glass slides with a soft brush, 1 slice per slide.\nPerform H&E staining as previously described19.\nExamine the slices under a microscope at 200x magnification using a 20 mm objective lens (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: The liver sections should be graded by a specialized pathologist blinded to the treatment protocol. A score of 0 indicates no liver abnormalities, 1–2 indicates mild liver injury, 3–4 indicates moderate liver injury, and 5–6 indicates severe liver injury20,21,22.\nSubscription Required.
