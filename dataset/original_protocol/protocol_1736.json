    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nProtocol 1 – recording and analysis of cortical interneuron migration parameters in organotypic brain slices\nOrganotypic brain slices culture is a well suited protocol to study interneuron migration parameters in a context close to in-vivo situation. Here, we used organotypic brain slices at E13.5 from a transgenic mouse model characterized by expression of GFP by interneurons (Dlx5/6-Cre-IRES-EGFP).\nPreparation of the embedding solution\nTiming: 25 min\nPrepare a 2%–4% agarose solution for brain embedding by adding 0.5 g to 1 g of low-melting agarose into a 50 mL conical tube containing 25 mL of sterile HBSS.\nNote: a 2% solution is recommended for E12.5 brain, while a 4% solution is well-suited for E13.5 to E16.5 brains.\nTransfer the tube into a microwave and bring the solution to boil. Keep the tube cap loose until the agarose is completely dissolved.\nNote: prevent excess boiling and overflow while heating the solution; when the solution starts to boil, stop the microwave, close the tube and mix by inverting the tube several times; repeat the heating step until complete dissolution of the agarose. Protect your hands from burns by wearing heat-resistant gloves.\nTransfer the tube into a 37°C incubator and allow the solution to cool down during approximately 20 min keeping the cap loose to allow air bubbles to escape. It is crucial to cool down the agarose solution to avoid burning the brain meninges during the embedding procedure.\nDissection and embedding of embryonic brains\nTiming: 30 min\nThe embedding of brains in polymerized agarose solution allows mechanical support during slicing, and prevent the expansion of the tissue while maintained in culture.\nTime-mated females are sacrificed by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation to confirm death.",
    "Note: Euthanasia methods may vary from one country to another. Please refer to your local ethical regulations. If needed, anaesthesia can be induced before cervical dislocation using an induction chamber filled with a mixture of 96% air and 4% isoflurane.\nAfter sacrifice, disinfect the abdomen of the pregnant female with 70% alcoholic solution and open it with fine scissors under a laminar flow hood. Collect the uterus and excise the embryos from the amniotic sac using forceps. Immediately harvest the embryos in sterile ice-cold HBSS; section the head and dissect the embryonic brain. Here, we used E13.5 embryos.\nNote: For embryos between E12.5 and E13.5, brain dissection must be performed carefully in order to preserve the meninges that will maintain the brain structure.\nNote: If a transgenic mice model expressing a fluorescent protein as reporter is used, a fluorescence binocular microscope might be useful to select the transgenic embryos. Here, we used Dlx5/6-Cre-IRES-EGFP transgenic mice.\nPour the low-melting agarose solution previously cooled to 37°C in 35 × 10 mm petri-dish. Do not fill completely the dish to prevent the dish cover to touch the agarose.\nNote: Do not embed the brains in an agarose solution containing air bubbles; discard the top part of the solution containing air bubbles if necessary, before pouring the solution in the petri-dish.\nQuickly transfer the brains into the agarose solution using a perforated spoon; remove the excess of HBSS from the spoon using Tork® paper.\nCarefully rotate the brains with forceps until the olfactory bulbs face the bottom of the petri-dish, and the hindbrain locating at the top.\nNote: This orientation is optimal to perform coronal slices at the vibratome by starting the slicing from the olfactory bulbs; for sagittal or horizontal slicing, it might be easier to orient the brains differently during embedding.",
    "Critical: Step 6 to 8 must be completed quickly; agarose solution undergoes polymerization in few minutes at a temperature under 37°C and in few seconds at 4°C. Rotation of the brains in a rigid polymerizing agarose solution could damage the tissue because of the pressure.\nPlace the petri-dish on ice ensuring that brains hold a good orientation; repeatedly rectify brain position with the help of forceps until the agarose solution is solid enough to maintain the brains.\nCritical: A good orientation of brains within the agarose block at this step is key to allow proper slicing with the vibratome. The parallel positioning of the sectioning plane and the bottom of the petri-dish allows you to immediately glue the top side of the agarose block, without additional adjustments. However, if the brain is not perfectly oriented after agarose polymerization, adjust progressively the orientation by cutting the bottom of the agarose block with a razor blade.\nLet the agarose block solidify on ice for 20 min.\nSlicing and culture of brain slices\nTiming: 30 min\nOrganotypic brain slices are obtained with a vibratome and maintained on a millicell membrane placed in a MatTek® glass-bottom dish filled with culture medium. This method is recommended to maintain the viability of organotypic slices for one to three days.\nPrepare the MatTek® dish under the cell culture hood by adding 1.6 mL of culture medium. Install the millicell with sterile forceps. Place it progressively, starting with an angle of 30° to prevent the formation of air bubbles underneath. Transfer the dish into an incubator set at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nFill the vibratome tray with ice-cold HBSS and surround the tray with ice. Set the following parameters: section thickness: 300 μm; speed: 3; frequency: 3.",
    "Note: These parameters are adjusted for a vibratome Leica VT100S and might need optimization according to the type of vibratome.\nCut the agarose block with a truncated pyramid shape using a razor blade, with the hindbrain towards the major base (at the bottom) and the olfactory bulbs facing the top of the pyramid (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B). This shape allows a good stability of the agarose block and prevents its break.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1325-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Organotypic brain slice preparation\n(A and B) Embedded E13.5 brains. Trim the agarose block into a truncated pyramidal shape so that olfactory bulbs face the smallest edge of the pyramid, the hindbrain facing the major base glued on the vibratome support (see figure A on the right, and figure B).\n(C) Vibratome slicing. Place the brains in the vibratome tray containing ice-cold HBSS with the ventral part facing the blade.\n(D) Culture of slices. The slices are cultured on a millicell membrane placed in a MatTek® glass-bottom whose bottom is irrigated with the maintenance culture medium to optimize gas exchange in the slices.\nGlue the agarose block on its major base on the vibratome support making sure that the olfactory bulbs face upward. With this orientation, the vibratome will perform slicing from rostral (olfactory bulbs) to caudal (hindbrain) regions.\nPlace the support with the brain in the vibratome tray. The ventral part of the brain should face the blade of the vibratome (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C), as starting to slice from the cortex might tear it apart. By positioning the brain this way, the razor blade will perform a forward movement starting from the ventral part of the brain and finishing by the dorsal part (cortex) for each slice.",
    "Note: It is possible to cut several brains at the same time. However, make sure that the brains placed on the vibratome support fit with the size of the razor blade (otherwise the brains would not be cut properly).\nProceed to the slicing until obtaining medial to caudal brain slices.\nNote: Only comparable slices from different brains should be used for the analysisin order to minimize the analysis bias due to regional differences in interneuron migration streams.\nCollect brain slices with a spatula without detaching the tissue from its surrounding agarose. Transfer the slices on the millicell insert (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) and place the dish in the incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nCritical: Keep adding more ice around the tray during the whole procedure if needed. Keeping a low temperature reduces cell death and prevents the separation of the tissue from the agarose.\nNote: Up to five slices can be collected on a millicell, depending on the width of the agarose block. Do not overlap the edges of the slices as it will compromise the proper live-imaging acquisition (e.g., expansion of the tissue; blurred images).\nTime-lapse microscopy\nTiming: 10 h\nAfter 4 to 24 h of recovery in the incubator, the migration of GFP-expressing cortical interneurons can be recorded for few hours at the confocal microscope.\nPlace the dishes in the atmosphere-controlled recording chamber of an inverted confocal microscope (here we used a Nikon A1R microscope) and set the parameters to 37°C and 5% CO2.\nFocus on interneuron migratory streams in the cortex using a 20× long-range objective (0.45 mm) (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A for a representative image of the region of interest). The two interneuron migratory streams in the marginal zone (MZ) and intermediate zone (IZ) should be clearly recognizable.",
    "Acquire time-lapse images. Image at least 5 Z-steps of 2 μm every 5 min for 5 to 10 h. Interneurons should be traceable for at least 3 h.\nCritical: it is very important to set the laser power at a level allowing the visualization of the migrating cell bodies without inducing phototoxicity; fluorescent cells are photosensitive and an over-exposition would impair migration parameters and viability. Dying cells can be recognized by the appearance of large vacuoles or fluorescent protein aggregation, as well as disintegrated cell processes. It should be mentioned that recording with a two-photon microscope is particularly well-suited as it reduces phototoxicity.\nNote: Any confocal microscope can be used as long as an atmosphere-controlled recording chamber and a long-range objective are available. The 20× objective is well suited for this experiment as it allows to follow migrating interneurons during few hours before they leave the image field. A 40× long-range objective might work as well.\nProtocol 2 – recording and analysis of cortical interneuron branching using MGE explant culture\nThis protocol consists in a 2D culture of migrating interneurons that exit from MGE explants. Compared to the first protocol, it allows a more detailed analysis of interneuron branching behavior.\nPreparation of black sylgard dissection dishes\nTiming: 7 h\nMix 5 mL of pre-polymer with 45 mL of catalyst coming from the SYLGARD™ 184 Silicone Elastomer Kit (as indicated in the manufacturer’s datasheet) in a 50 mL conical tube. Add 3 mL of Chinese ink and mix with a spatula.\nPlace the tube on a 360°C vertical shaker for 30 min. The ink should be homogeneously mixed to the solution.\nCentrifuge at 120 xg for 5 min.\nPrepare two Sylgard dishes by pouring 25 mL of the solution in two 100 × 17 mm petri-dishes.",
    "Place the dishes in a vacuum bell for 1h to remove the bubbles. Remove the remaining bubbles with a micropipette tip if necessary.\nHeat the dishes at 60°C for minimum 5 h.\nNote: These dishes can be prepared a long time before the day of the experiment. After use, clean them with ethanol 70%; rinse them with water and let them dry. They can be reused for next experiments.\nPlasmid preparation\nTiming: 3–5 min\nPrepare the plasmid solution at 1 μg/μL in PBS with 0.05% Fast Green for a total volume of 15 μL.\nPull glass microcapillaries by using a P-97 Flaming/Brown type Micropipette Puller. Set the following parameters: heat, 634; pull, 92; velocity, 115; time, 210.\nNote: the efficacy of the heating filament from one instrument to another might be slightly different; if needed, adapt the pulling conditions on your instrument.\nPreparation of homochronic cortical feeder layer\nTiming: 5 h 30\nThe migration of interneurons out of MGE explants strongly depends on the coating used to cover the glass-bottom dish. An homochronic layer of cortical cells is the most appropriate migration substrate for MGE explants as it recapitulates most properties of cortical interneuron migration in vivo (Bellion et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The cortical feeder layer should be prepared the day before culturing the MGE explants.\nCoat the 4 compartments glass-bottom dish with 0.1 mg/mL poly-L-ornithine (pH=8.4) diluted in sterile water. Add 200 μL per compartment. Incubate the dish in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 45 min.\nNote: Microscopes usually allow imaging one or two petri-dishes at a time. Therefore, the 4 compartments dishes are useful to test different conditions. For experiments with only one condition, the non-compartmented glass-bottom dishes work as well (but adapt the volume to 700 μL per dish).",
    "Wash the dish compartments three times with sterile water.\nDilute laminin in sterile ice-cold PBS to reach a final concentration of 5 μg/mL. Add 200 μL per compartment and incubate 2 h at 37°C. Alternatively, laminin can be incubated up to 24 h at 37°C.\nWash the dish compartments three times with sterile PBS. Place the dish with PBS back to the 37°C incubator.\nNote: Make sure to not let the dish dry as it will disrupt laminin structure and thus impair cell attachment.\nSacrifice the E13.5 wild-type pregnant female by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation to confirm death.\nNote: Euthanasia methods may vary from one country to another. Please refer to your local ethical regulations. If needed, anaesthesia can be induced before cervical dislocation using an induction chamber filled with a mixture of 96% air and 4% isoflurane.\nAfter sacrifice, disinfect the abdomen of the pregnant female with 70% alcoholic solution and open it with fine scissors under a laminar flow hood. Extract the uterus and excise the embryos from the amniotic sac using forceps. Immediately harvest the embryos in sterile ice-cold HBSS; section the heads and dissect the brains (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B). Clean brains from meninges as much as possible without damaging cortices. It is recommended to dissect one embryo per dish plus one extra embryo (i.e. two embryos for one dish, three embryos for two dishes, etc).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1325-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cortices dissection\n(A) Head of E13.5 mice embryo. Hold the brain at the level of the nose or the hindbrain and remove the skin and cartilage around the brain using forceps.\n(B) Dissected brain.\n(C) Dissected hindbrain (bottom) and hemispheres (top).\n(D) Dissected cortex (Ctx) and ganglionic eminences (GE). Cut out the cortex around the ganglionic eminences without damaging cortical cells.\nScale bar, 1000 μm",
    "Separate cortices from ganglionic eminences (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D) using forceps to pin ganglionic eminences and hold the tissue, and a micro knife to cut at the border between cortex and ganglionic eminences. Transfer cortices using forceps in one sterile Eppendorf® tube filled with HBSS and keep on ice.\nUnder a culture hood, replace HBSS by 800 μL of cold culture medium and mechanically dissociate the embryo cortices by pipetting up and down with a P1000 micropipette (∼20 times).\nFiltrate the dissociated cells through a sterile 40 μm cell strainer.\nReplace the PBS from the coated dishes by 200 μL of dissociated cells per compartment.\nNote: For the preparation of more than one dish, add the amount of culture medium necessary to the dissociated cell solution.\nPlace the dish back into the incubator set to 37°C and 5% CO2 and let the cells adhere for 2 h. During that time, bring the temperature of the culture medium to 37°C.\nSlowly add 600 μL of heated culture medium to each compartment, making sure to not detach the adhered cells. Maintain the dish in the same conditions in the incubator until the next day.\nElectroporation and culture of MGE explants\nTiming: 45 min\nFill a microcapillary with 10 μL of plasmid solution previously prepared using microloader tips. Cut approximately 2 mm of the capillary tip using small spring scissors.\nNote: The tip of a newly pulled microcapillary is closed, and prevents the plasmid solution to enter into the tip. The solution is allowed to reach the microcapillary tip once it is cut to the edge.\nNote: The plasmid concentration should be between 0.5 and 1 μg/μL. The electroporation of an excessive amount of plasmid might generate cellular toxicity.",
    "Place the capillary on the Femtojet microinjector station and set the following parameters: Pi, 100 hPa; Ti, 1.7s; Pc, 17 hPa.\nInstall the electrodes and set the parameters of the ECMTM 830 electroporator as following: polarity, unipolar; mode, LV; voltage, 50V; pulse length, 50 msec; interval, 1 sec; pulses, 5.\nSacrifice the E13.5 wild-type pregnant female by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation to confirm death.\nNote: Euthanasia methods may vary from one country to another. Please refer to your local ethical regulations. If needed, anaesthesia can be induced before cervical dislocation using an induction chamber filled with a mixture of 96% air and 4% isoflurane.\nAfter sacrifice, disinfect the abdomen of the pregnant female with 70% alcoholic solution and open it with fine scissors under a laminar flow hood. Collect the uterus and excise the embryos from the amniotic sac using forceps. Immediately harvest the embryos in sterile ice-cold HBSS; section the heads and place them in the black Sylgard dissection dish filled with cold PBS.\nStabilize the head in the Sylgard dissection dish placing one pin at the level of the nose and another one at the level of the hindbrain (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1325-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. MGE electroporation\n(A) Pinned head of E13.5 mice embryo. Put one pin in the nose (top) and one pin in the hindbrain (bottom).\n(B) Injection of plasmid solution in the MGEs. The white arrowhead shows the microcapillary tip. The white dotted lines represent MGE borders.\n(C) Electroporation of the brain. The white arrowheads show the electrodes placed from either side of the head.\n(D) Pinned head after injection of plasmid solution in the MGEs and electroporation. It is possible to distinguish the injected MGEs thanks to the Fast Green contained in the plasmid solution.\nScale bar, 1000 μm",
    "Using forceps, tear apart the skin and open the skull to reach the forebrain. Then, using two pairs of forceps, gently open the dorsal cortex by making a hole and stretching the tissue in order to visualize the ganglionic eminences located inside the brain, just beneath the dorsal cortex. Make sure to not pin your forceps too deeply in the tissue as you would damage the ganglionic eminences.\nUsing the microcapillary and the injector, inject the plasmid of interest in both MGEs, directly into the tissue (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Perform up to ten injections in each MGE, making sure to not completely damage the tissue.\nNote: We usually inject around 0.1 μL plasmid solution per MGE in total. By cutting 2 mm of the microcapillary tip, the injection volume does not strongly vary. However, the volume ejected from the microcapillary when pressing the “injection” button can be determined if necessary. To do so, continuously press the injection button of the injector until 1 μL of the solution is ejected from the microcapillary. The number of injection is automatically counted by the injector. The volume ejected from the microcapillary when pressing the injection button corresponds to 1 μL divided per the number of injections performed. Using this method, it is possible to determine the exact volume injected in the MGE. Adapt the number of injections according to that volume.\nThe volume remaining in the microcapillary at the end of the experiment can be retrieve using a microloader tip, and kept at −20°C.\nElectroporate the brain by placing the tweezer platinum electrodes from either side of the head at the level of the MGE (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C and 3D).\nCritical: Do not touch the metallic pins with the electrodes during electroporation.",
    "Note: The relative positions of positive and negative electrodes are not important as the plasmid solution is injected in multiple regions of the MGE tissue. Using this method, both hemispheres are electroporated, and MGE cells around the injection sites incorporated the plasmid.\nMicro dissect the electroporated MGE and cut it in multiple small blocks (300–500 μm3) with forceps or with a micro knife. Each piece is considered as an explant.\nTake the dish coated with cortical feeder out of the incubator and remove the culture medium. Only leave a thin layer of medium so that the cortical feeder does not dry.\nPlace the electroporated explants on the cortical feeder. Transfer the dish in the incubator for approximately 10 min to allow the explants to adhere to the cortical feeder.\nSlowly add 800 μL of culture medium to each compartment of the dish, making sure to not detach the explants.\nTime-lapse microscopy\nTiming: 10 h\nTime-lapse recordings of explant culture are usually performed after 24 h of culture, when the cortical interneurons have migrated out of the explants. Explant cultures can be kept healthy for up to 3 days. Half of the culture medium should be replaced every day.\nPlace the dishes in the recording chamber of an inverted confocal microscope (here, Zeiss LSM 880) and set the parameters to 37°C and 5% CO2.\nFocus on the edge of the migratory front to record individual migrating interneurons. This makes the analysis of the branching parameters easier. Use a 20× long-range objective.\nAcquire time-lapse images; image at least 5 Z-steps of 2 μm each 5 min for 5 to 10 h.",
    "Critical: it is very important to set the laser power at a level that allows visualizing the leading process branches without inducing phototoxicity; cells expressing fluorophores are photosensitive and laser over exposure would impair migration parameters and viability. Dying cells can be recognized by the appearance of large vacuoles or fluorescent protein aggregation, as well as disintegrated cell processes.\nNote: Any confocal microscope can be used as long as an atmosphere-controlled recording chamber and a long-range objective are available. The 20× objective is well suited for this experiment as it allows to follow migrating interneurons during few hours before they leave the image field. A 40× long-range objective might work as well."
