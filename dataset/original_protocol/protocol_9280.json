    "1. Dissection of the Gut Epithelium from R. microplus\nCollect semi-engorged ticks from cattle on the day of experiment. Dissect ticks within 24 h after removal from the host.\nAdhere a strip of duct tape to the bottom of the 92 mm x 16 mm Petri dish. Add a drop of super glue to the tape. Place the tick, ventral side down on the super glue, allow to dry for 2 min.\nPour 100 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into the petri dish, or until the tick is completely submerged.\nUtilizing a size 11 scalpel, cut from the top of the eyes to the bottom festoons, on both sides of the tick.\nUsing sterile forceps, completely remove the scutum and alloscutum, to expose the internal organs.\nRemove the fine white thread-like organs (trachea) and other membranes to prevent contamination.\nRemove the gut using forceps, by pinching the upper region and pulling from the carcass. Remove any remaining gut tissues, ensuring that no other tissues have been dissected.\nStore gut in ice-cold Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) without calcium chloride and magnesium sulfate with proteinase-inhibitor cocktail (PIC). Snap freeze the guts in dry ice and store at -20 °C.\n\tNote: To assist with gut dissection and details of the tick internal organs refer to Chapter 3.1 of D. Sonenshine, \"Biology of Ticks\"19.\n2. Epithelial Cell Dissociation\nPour the dissected gut onto a 70 µm cell strainer inside a 50 mL tube.\nFlush the gut tissue with 50 mL ice cold HBSS with PIC until the solution runs clear, and the guts take on a white/clear appearance.",
    "Re-suspend guts in 30 mL ice cold HBSS with PIC, mix gently and centrifuge at 500 x g at 4 °C for 10 min to pellet the gut. Remove the supernatant and repeat the wash process three times.\nTo dislodge epithelial gut cells, re-suspend the gut in 10 mL of cell culture medium Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM), 2% fetal calf serum (FCS), 0.5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP), PIC and incubate for 60 min at 37 °C under slow rotation using a roller at 6 rpm.\nFilter the suspension through a 250 µm cell strainer, vortex the flow-through and filter through a 70 µm cell strainer collecting the remaining flow-through.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 500 x g at 4 °C for 20 min to pellet the single cells.\n3. Isolation of Single Epithelial Cells using a density centrifugation gradient\nPrepare density centrifugation gradient (e.g., Percoll) by filtering through an AP15 pre-filter paper. Prepare 40% and a 20% Percoll in mqH20 (v/v) and cool at 4 °C for 1 h prior to layering the gradient.\nUsing a peristaltic pump set at the lowest speed, layer 3 mL of 40% density centrifugation gradient into a 16 mL ultracentrifuge tube, allowing it to settle on ice for 15 min. Speed of the pump should lead to a <1 mL per min flow rate.\nTilting the tube to a 45° angle, use the peristaltic pump to layer the 20% density centrifugation gradient on top of the 40% layer. Speed of the pump should lead to <1 mL per min flow rate. Allow the layers to settle on ice for 15 min.\nUse the peristaltic pump at <1 mL per min flow rate to layer 3 mL of DMEM medium containing tick gut cells over the 20-40% density centrifugation gradient.",
    "Program the centrifuge for maximum acceleration and minimum deceleration. Centrifuge at 600 x g for 10 min. Collect interphases between the DMEM:20% density centrifugation gradient, and the 20%: 40% density centrifugation gradients to isolate epithelial single cells. Store collected interphases at 4 °C for subsequent analyses.\n4. Assessment of Cell Isolation\nHemacytometer\nClean the hemacytometer slide with alcohol.\n.Re-suspend the cells by gently pipetting the cells up and down. Pipette 100 µL of the cell suspension and place in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 400 µL of 0.4% Trypan Blue. Gently mix by flicking the tube.\nPipette 100 µL of the Trypan Blue-treated cell suspension to slowly fill both chambers of the hemocytometer.\nPlace the hemocytometer under a light microscope, focusing upon the grid lines of the hemocytometer with a 10X objective.\nUsing a hand-held tally counter, count the live unstained cells within a set of 16 squares. Within the same square, count the blue dead cells. Continue counting until four sets of 16 squares are counted.\nCalculate the total cells per mL by using the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55747/55747eq1.jpg\nCalculate the percentage cell viability by using the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55747/55747eq2.jpg\nCell Isolate Visualization\nDilute 1 µL of the isolated cells in 9 µL of HBSS in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Flick the microcentrifuge tube gently to mix.\nPipette 5 µL of isolated cells in HBSS into the middle of a glass slide. Apply three drops of mounting medium with 4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).\nIncubate the slide at room temperature for 5 min. Carefully place a cover slip over the preparation, avoiding air bubbles.\nVisualize cells stained with DAPI at excitation 360 nm and emission at 460 nm under a fluorescent microscope.\n5. Cell Surface Protein Biotinylation",
    "Biotinylate 100 µL of single cell epithelial cells using Biotin (Type A) Conjugation kit, at a molar ratio of 1:1 surface protein to conjugate, as per manufacturer's instructions\nFor cell lysis, add 100 µL of PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 100 µM oxidized glutathione and PIC to the biotinylated cells. Incubate on ice for 1 h with gentle mixing every 10 min.\nCentrifuge the biotinylated cells at 20,000 x g at 4 °C for 20 min to pellet insoluble material. Collect the supernatant containing cytoplasmic, and biotinylated membrane proteins.\nDetermine the protein concentration using the Bradford assay.\n6. Isolation of Biotinylated Surface Proteins\nAdd 50 µL of Streptavidin Magnetic Beads into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nPlace the tube into a magnetic stand, collecting the beads against the side of the tube. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 1000 µL of TBS, 0.1% Tween-20 to the tube. Mix gently and collect the beads with the magnetic stand. Remove and discard the supernatant.\nCombine 40 µg of biotinylated cell surface proteins, diluted to 300 µL in 1x PBS with washed magnetic beads. Incubate for 2 h at room temperature with agitation.\nCollect the beads with a magnetic stand, remove and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 300 µL of TBS, 0.1% Tween-20 to the tube, gently mixing to re-suspend the beads. Collect beads, remove and discard the supernatant. Repeat this wash step twice.\nAdd 100 µL of the 0.1 M glycine pH 2.0 to the magnetic beads, and incubate at room temperature for 5 min. Collect beads and remove supernatant containing eluted biotinylated surface proteins.\nVisualize isolated surface proteins on a 4-20% Tris-MOPS SDS-PAGE gel.\n7. Assessment of Biotinylated Surface Protein\nDot Blot\nCut a 7 cm x 3 cm strip of nitrocellulose membrane.",
    "Apply 10 µg total tick gut contents (from 1.8 above), and 10 µg of biotinylated surface protein to the membrane. Allow drying for 15 min at room temperature.\nTransfer to a container and submerge in 100 mL of blocking buffer. Incubate at room temperature with agitation for an hour. Discard blocking buffer.\nWash nitrocellulose membrane in 100 µL PBS, 0.05% Tween-20 for 5 min with agitation. Discard wash buffer and repeat the washes for three times.\nIncubate in 1/5000 Streptavidin- horseradish peroxidase (HRP)in 100 µL PBS, 0.05% Tween-20 for 2 h with agitation at room temperature, and discard any remaining solution.\nWash nitrocellulose membrane in 100 µL of PBS, 0.05% Tween-20 for 5 min with agitation. Discard wash buffer and repeat the wash three times.\nFor detection, dissolve 1 tablet of 4-chloro-1-napthol in 10 mL of ice cold methanol. Add 4 mL of methanol stock to 20 mL of TBS. Add 10 µL of fresh 30% hydrogen peroxide and immediately apply to nitrocellulose membrane.\nIncubate with agitation at room temperature until substrate produces an insoluble blue end product. This may take between 2-15 min.\nDiscard detection solution and wash the membrane three times in 100 µL mqH2O.\nELISA Assay\nDilute 200 ng of each sample with 400 µL of 100 mM Carbonate coating buffer and coat 2 lanes of the first row (A#) of the ELISA plate (flat bottom wells)\nAdd 100 µL of 100 mM carbonate coating buffer to all other corresponding wells in rows (B-H).\nPrepare serial dilutions of each sample by pipetting 100 µL from each well in row A, and transferring into row B. Mix gently by pipetting and avoid producing bubbles. Repeat the dilutions down each row, discarding the final 100 µL from each well in row H.",
