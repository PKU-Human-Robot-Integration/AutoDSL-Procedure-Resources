    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCritical: Placentas utilized in this protocol must be obtained with written and informed consent in accordance with the appropriate ethics guidelines, committees, and institutions.\nCritical: All steps should be completed under sterile conditions in a BSC free from contamination unless otherwise stated.\nPlacental tissue collection and preparation\nTiming: 0.5 h\nThis describes the aseptic preparation of the placental tissue and includes dissection specifications to optimize the following section in which the tissue is enzymatically and mechanically digested.\nHealthy human full-term placenta is donated via cesarean section and transferred to an autoclaved stainless-steel tray for dissection and processing within an hour immediately after surgery.\nIn a cell culture hood under sterile conditions, use forceps and scissors to remove any calcified tissue on the placenta and remove the thin layer of the maternal placental decidua (top layer) to avoid any maternal cell contamination.\nUsing forceps and scissors, dissect out 50 g of placental villi, which is enriched with fetal vasculature, and transfer onto a petri dish with washing buffer. Avoid collecting tissue from any clotted regions.\nAfter placing the placenta villi section onto a petri dish, rinse the tissue with washing buffer until blood residue is removed. The tissue is now ready for digestion.\nPlacental tissue digestion\nTiming: 2 h\nThis section specifies the steps for optimal placental tissue digestion, enabling creation of a placental single-cell suspension.\nTo aid enzymatic digestion efficiency, cut the villi into smaller pieces using surgical scissors, ensuring the vessel structures are homogenized.\nTransfer the tissue into a 250 mL conical flask for digestion and add 75–80 mL of digestion buffer to the flask.\nDigest the tissue for 2 h at 37°C in an incubated, preferably sterile, shaker, providing constant agitation at 65 rpm.\nPreparation of single cell suspension\nTiming: 1 h",
    "Described here is the preparation of the placental single-cell suspension to allow for optimal downstream sub-populational enrichment. This section includes a pause point in which the placental single-cell suspension can be cryopreserved for use at a later date.\nAfter 2 h of digestion, back in a BSC, filter the cell suspension to remove undigested aggregations using a 100 μm cell strainer, collecting the single cell suspension into an appropriate number of 50 mL falcon tubes at approximately 20 mL/ tube. Discard any undigested tissue. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nDilute the single-cell suspension by adding 20 mL of ice-cold DPBS per 50 mL falcon tube.\nPellet the cell suspension via centrifugation using 350 × g with (break speed 5) for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard 30–35 mL of the supernatant carefully using a 25 mL serological pipette. The cell pellet is soft, pipette slow to avoid loss of sample.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 30 mL of red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer per 50 mL falcon tube, and incubate for 10 min on ice at 4°C.\nCritical: The suspension will appear pinkish-clear when lysis is successful. Incubation longer than 10 min will result in excessive cell death and loss of stem cell yield. It is critical to remove the remaining RBC lysis buffer. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nTo remove the RBC lysis buffer, wash the pellet 2 times. To wash the first time, centrifuge the cell suspension at 350 × g (break speed 5) for 5 min at 4°C. Discard 35 mL of the supernatant using a 25 mL serological pipette. The cell pellet is soft, pipette slow to avoid loss of sample.",
    "To wash the second time, resuspend the cell pellet in 35 mL ice-cold MACS buffer per 50 mL falcon tube centrifuge at 350 × g (break speed 5) for 5 min at 4°C to re-pellet. Again, discard the supernatant using a 25 mL serological pipette. The cell pellet is soft pipette slow to avoid loss of sample.\nResuspend the cell suspension in 20 mL ice-cold MACS buffer to perform a cell count.\nPause point: Here it is possible to continue ECFC isolation (continue to step 16) or prepare samples for long-term cryogenic storage. Alternatively, cryogenic storage can be performed following CD45 depletion or CD34 enrichment to reduce the quantity of vials needed. See Option a: cryogenic storage of sample for cryogenic storage and see Option b: thawing of samples from cryogenic storage for thawing procedure.\nCryogenic storage of sample.\nResuspend cell pellet at 1–5 million cells per mL of cryopreserving solution. Quickly aliquot 1 mL of the cell suspension per cryovial.\nPlace cryovials into a Cool Cell™ Freezing Container and transfer to a −80°C freezer or liquid nitrogen after 24 h.\nThawing of samples from cryogenic storage.\nCritical: To use cells from long term cryopreservation storage, the following steps should be completed rapidly to remove cells from DMSO and maximize cell viability.\nAdd an appropriate amount of pre-warmed (37°C) Complete Culture Medium to a single cryovial of frozen cells. Gently pipette up and down until thawed.\nTransfer the thawed cell suspension to a 15- or 50-mL falcon tube. If it is a pre-depletion/ enrichment sample being thawed, 5 cryovials should be thawed per 50 mL falcon tube. Repeat until all cryovials are thawed.",
    "Top up each falcon tube to 20 mL with Complete Culture Medium and wash the cells via centrifugation at 350 × g (break speed 5) for 5 min at 4°C.\nCarefully discard the supernatant using a 25 mL serological pipette. The cell pellet is soft pipette slow to avoid loss of sample.\nResuspend in 20 mL ice-cold MACS buffer and perform a cell count.\nResuspend the cell pellet in ice-cold MACS buffer at 1 × 107 cells/mL. Separate 50 mL falcon tubes can be consolidated at this step if appropriate.\nSet aside a 100 μL aliquot of placental cell suspension (approximately 1 × 106 cells) into a sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and keep on ice until step 33 for preparation of flow cytometry with FACS antibody staining controls. This is referred to as the antibody control aliquot.\nCritical: Due to the low frequency of MSCs and ECFCs in the total placenta cell suspension, it is essential not to waste the enriched CD45 negative (CD45NEG) and CD34 positive (CD34POS) cell fraction.\nDynabeads™ CD45 depletion\nTiming: 0.75 h\nHere the placental single-cell suspension undergoes the first round of sub-populational enrichment via Dynabead™ CD45 depletion to remove any hematopoietic lineage contamination. The subsequent isolate is referred to as the CD45NEG cell fraction. This enrichment enables time and cost reduction in later FACS steps, while increasing stem cell populational purity.\nPrime 1 × 15 mL falcon tube of Dynabeads™ CD45 per 2.5 mL of placental cell suspension or less. To prime the beads, place 250 μL of Dynabeads™ CD45 in 3 mL of MACS buffer and homogenize.",
    "Slot the Dynabeads™ CD45 suspension into the DynaMag™-15 Magnet placed inside the biological safety cabinet for 1 min to wash (See here for DynaMag Setup). Tip the magnet forward, keeping the 15 mL falcon tube containing Dynabeads™ CD45 suspension secure in the magnet to collect and subsequently discard the supernatant.\nRemove the falcon tube containing the primed Dynabeads™ CD45 from the DynaMag™-15 Magnet and resuspend the Dynabeads™ CD45 in 250 μL of MACS buffer.\nAdd 2.5 mL of the placental cell suspension (1 × 107 cells/mL) to the washed Dynabeads™ CD45 suspension to make a Dynabeads™ CD45 cell suspension, gently mix well, and incubate for 20 min on a roller at 4°C.\nOnce incubated add 10 mL of MACS buffer to the Dynabeads™ CD45 cell suspension and place into the DynaMag™-15 Magnet for 2 min.\nCollect the non-bound CD45NEG cells in suspension in a new sterile 15 mL Falcon tube by tipping the magnet forward as previously described. This is the CD45NEG cell suspension. Save this suspension.\nCritical: Label collection tubes clearly and adhere to the protocol to avoid the collection of the wrong fraction.\nPellet the CD45NEG cell suspension at 350 × g (break speed 5) for 5 min at 4°C to collect the cell pellet. Carefully remove the supernatant using a 10 mL stripette.\nConsolidate any CD45NEG samples from separate falcon tubes together at 1 × 107 cells/mL in ice-cold MACS buffer. Proceed to step 26.\nCD34 MACS microbead enrichment\nTiming: 1 h\nHere the placental single-cell suspension, now referred to as the CD45NEG cell-suspension, undergoes its second round of sub-populational enrichment via selection for CD34POS cells. This enrichment selects for endothelial lineage cells and, again, enables time and cost reduction in later FACS steps while increasing stem cell populational purity.",
    "Alternatives: CD34POS MACS™ Microbead enrichment can be achieved via 2 methods: Option a: Automatic, using the Miltenyi AutoMACS™ Pro Separator or Option b: Manual, using the MidiMACS™ Separator. Proceed to step 26 regardless and choose an alternative method at step 29.\nAdd 100 μL of CD34 microbeads to the CD45NEG cell suspension for up to 1 × 108 cells. Mix well and incubate on ice for 20 min at 4°C.\nAfter incubation, top up the CD45NEG cell suspension with 10 mL MACS buffer.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 350 × g for 5 min (break speed 5) at 4°C to collect the cell pellet. Carefully remove the supernatant using a 10 mL stripette.\nCD34 enrichment.\nAutomatic.\nResuspend the CD45NEG cell pellet in 5 mL of autoMACS running buffer and label 2 × 15 mL falcon tubes “CD34 negative” (CD34NEG) and CD34POS for fraction collection. Pre-chill tubes by placing on ice for transport to the Miltenyi AutoMACS Pro Separator.\nTransport the sample, AutoMACS buffer, and chilled collection tubes to the Miltenyi AutoMACS Pro Separator.\nCritical: The Miltenyi AutoMACS Pro Separator should be operated by a trained individual only (See Miltenyi AutoMACS Pro Separator Setup). An overview of operation can be found below but is NOT a comprehensive guide. Please seek training where appropriate.\nLoad the autoMACS running buffer into the corresponding position, switch on the Miltenyi AutoMACS Pro Separator and allow the initialisation program to run.\nPrime the Miltenyi AutoMACS Pro Separator.\nPlace the chill rack onto the autoMACS MiniSampler and load the CD45NEG cell suspension, CD34NEG collection tube, and CD34POS collection tube into their corresponding positions.\nUnder the “Separation” menu, fill in the sample separation template field and select the “POSSEL” selection program with a “Rinse” wash cycle between samples if appropriate.\nRun program.",
    "Once complete, transfer the CD45NEGCD34POS cell suspension to ice. Save this population.\nCritical: Label collection tubes clearly and adhere to the protocol closely to avoid collection of the wrong fraction.\nEnsure the correct shutdown functions are performed on the Miltenyi AutoMACS Pro Separator. Proceed to step 30.\nManual.\nAn LS column can load up to 2 × 109 total cells. Place the LS column in the magnetic field of the MidiMACS™ Separator (see here for MidiMACS™ Separator Setup).\nTo prepare the LS column, pre-wash the column by loading 3 mL of MACS buffer and discard the flow-through.\nCritical: Make sure the column reservoir is empty before proceeding to the next step.\nCritical: Label collection tubes clearly and adhere to the protocol to avoid collection of the wrong fraction.\nLoad the labeled CD45NEG cell suspension onto the pre-washed column. Collect the flow-through in a new sterile 15 mL Falcon tube. This is the CD34NEG fraction. It is not necessary to keep this fraction.\nCritical: Make sure the column reservoir is empty before proceeding to the next step.\nWash the column with 3 mL of MACS buffer. Collect and combine with the CD34NEG flow-through. Repeat this wash 3 times.\nCritical: Make sure the column reservoir is empty before proceeding to the next step.\nRemove column from the MidiMACS™ Separator and place it on a new sterile 50 mL falcon tube.\nPipette 5 mL of MACS buffer onto the column and flush out the magnetic labeled cells by pushing the plunger into the column. This is the CD45NEGCD34POS cell suspension. Save this suspension. Proceed to step 30.\nCritical: Label collection tubes clearly and adhere to protocol to avoid collection of the wrong fraction.",
    "Back in the sterile BSC, top up the CD45NEGCD34POS cell suspension with 10 mL of ice-cold MACS buffer. Pellet the cell suspension via centrifugation at 350 × g (break speed 5) for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL ice cold MACS buffer. Transfer cell suspension to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube labeled “Sample” and place on ice for FACS antibody staining.\nAntibody staining\nTiming: 1 h\nHere the now enriched CD45NEGCD34POS cell-suspension undergoes antibody staining in preparation for FACS. Re-staining for CD45 and CD34 again ensures populational purity upon isolation, while the addition of CD31 staining, a marker for mature endothelium, enables identification of the MSC (CD31 negative, CD31NEG) and ECFC (CD31 low, CD31LO) populations. It is essential that these steps are followed as specified to ensure accurate cell sorting outcomes, including the preparation of unstained and single-stain staining controls for compensation set-up. Fluorescence-minus-one (FMO) staining controls are also critical to correctly identifying both MSC and ECFC populations.\nPrepare 9 × 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes for FACS staining controls, placing 50 μL of ice-cold MACS buffer in each. Label each tube as a single stain (7′AAD, CD45, CD34, and CD31), an FMO (7′AAD-FMO, CD45-FMO, CD34-FMO, and CD31-FMO), and unstained control.\nDilute the 100 μL antibody control aliquot (approximately 1 × 106 cells) from step 17 into 450 μL total volume using ice cold MACS buffer and place 50 μL into each of the staining control tubes on ice for a total volume of 100 μL per control.",
    "Add the appropriate volumes of CD45, CD34, and CD31 antibodies to their corresponding tubes (see: key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A for sample, FMO, and unstained control antibody groupings. Homogenize thoroughly and incubate on ice at 4°C out of the light for 20 min, on a roller.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1612-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Subsequent Sample gating is shown, as well as the Unstained Control.\nCritical: Do not add any antibodies to the unstained control and do not add 7′AAD Live/Dead until 15 min prior to sorting. This stain does not require washing out of the sample.\nOnce incubation is complete, remove excess antibody by washing. To do so, add 1 mL of MACS buffer to each tube and centrifuge the cell suspensions at 350 × g (break speed 5) for 5 min at 4°C to pellet.\nAspirate the supernatant completely. To resuspend the pellet, add 200 μL of ice-cold MACS buffer to each staining control and add 500 μL of ice-cold MACS buffer to the sample.\nTo ensure a single-cell suspension for FACS, filter each cell suspension using a 40 μm cell strainer into a respectively labeled 5 mL FACS tube with its lid and place on ice for transport to a sterile flow cytometry facility.\nFor sorting collection, prepare sterile 5 mL FACS tubes or 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes filled with 500 μL -1 mL filtered heat-inactivated FBS, labeled ECFC (CD45NEGCD34POSCD31LO) and MSC (CD45NEGCD34POSCD31NEG).\nFluorescence-activated cell sorting\nTiming: 2 h",
    "This section details the steps required for the isolation of both MSC (CD45NEGCD34POSCD31NEG) and ECFC (CD45NEGCD34POSCD31LO) stem cell populations via FACS. It is critical to refer to the sample flow plots provided to ensure accuracy of population selection.\nOn the flow cytometer use a 100 μm nozzle to achieve low pressure (approx. 20 psi) and run the samples at a medium flow rate (<2.0) with an event rate of approximately 1,000 events/ second.\nWarning: Flow cytometry with FACS should be completed on an appropriate machine operated by a trained individual. Please seek assistance or training where required.\nUse the unstained control and single-stained controls to set up compensation. FMOs should be used to set the appropriate gates (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nGenerate a forward scatter area (FSC-A) versus side scatter area (SSC-A) to select the total cell population (P1) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, Sample).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1612-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Population frequencies shown as percent (%) parent gate.\n(C) Representative flow pseudo-color smooth plot emphasizing the respective CD31NEG (MSC) (P6) and CD31LO (ECFC) (P7) populations.\nGenerate an FSC-A versus forward scatter height (FSC-H) to select for singlets, named P2 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, P1). SSC-A versus side scatter height (SSC-H) will confirm this, named P3 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, P2).\nTo select for the live population, generate 7′AAD PE-Cy5A versus SSC-A and gate on the negative fraction, termed P4 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, P3). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].",
    "Following this, generate CD34 PE-A versus CD45 FITC-A and create a gate on the CD45NEGCD31POS population, named P5 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, P4).\nGenerate a CD31 BV421-A versus SSC-A dot plot panel to identify the CD31NEG MSC population (P6) and CD31LO ECFC subset of endothelial cells (P7) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C, P5).\nSort these populations directly into ice-cold filtered heat-inactivated FBS.\nCritical: Obtain cell population numbers from the sort for the purpose of cell culture. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nPrimary cell culture and colony establishment\nTiming: 7–28+ days\nHere we describe the optimal process for encouraging MSC and ECFC colony formation and subsequent expansion. It is essential that sterile conditions are maintained throughout this process as these stem cells may remain in culture beyond 28 days. Please note that MSCs will often undergo clonogenesis and expansion 2× faster than ECFCs.\nFollowing collection, place isolated populations on ice and once back in a BSC top up with 3 mL ice cold DPBS.\nPellet cells via centrifugation 500 × g (break speed 5) for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend cells in warmed (37°C) Complete Culture Medium and seed onto a type I collagen-coated plate at approximately 1 × 104 cells/cm2. For example, a 96-well plate is often used for MSCs, while a 24-well plate is used for ECFCs.\nCulture cells at 37°C in a sterile primary incubator under standard mammalian conditions.\nAllow 48 h for cells to adequately attach to their plate. Any cells left in suspension following this are not likely to adhere.",
    "Following 48 h, refresh the Complete Culture Medium by carefully pipetting out the old media without touching the bottom of the well. To do this, rest the tip of the pipette tip against the wall of the well, close to the bottom. Leave 10% of the old media in the well to prevent cells drying out. Pipette new media in slowly, placing the pipette tip against the wall, approximately 1 cm from the base.\nRefresh media on a stringent 24-h basis for 5 days following attachment.\nRefresh Complete Culture Medium on a stringent 48-h basis thereafter until strong High Proliferative Potential ECFCs (HPP-ECFCs) and MSC colonies have formed, taking from 21–28 days for ECFCs and 7–14 days for MSCs (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and 3E).

Red indicates colony border.\n(D) Representative confocal images showing MSC colony formation (scale bar indicates 100 μm). Red indicates colony border.\nOnce adequate HPP-ECFCs and MSC colonies have been established, but before reaching confluency, passage cells (P0). Please note, MSCs may form colonies approximately 2× faster than HPP-ECFCs.",
    "To passage, wash the cells by removing the Complete Culture Medium by resting the tip of the pipette tip against the wall of the well, close to the bottom. Leave 10% of the old media in the well to prevent cells drying out.\nPlace enough DPBS to cover the well by slow pipetting, placing the pipette tip against the wall, approximately 1 cm from the base.\nRemove the DPBS by the same method and repeat the wash 1 time.\nComplete the final DPBS wash by removing all DPBS from the well. Add a volume of RT TrypLE to the culture plate. For example, add 100 μL to a single well of a 24-well plate.\nIncubate the cells in the TrypLE in a sterile incubator under standard conditions at 37°C for 3–5 min.\nUsing a microscope, check ECFCs or MSCs have detached, gently tapping the side of the vessel if necessary, and add a volume (e.g., 900 μL) of warm (37°C) Complete Culture Medium to inhibit the TrypLE and create a cell suspension.\nEnsure all cells have detached by gently washing over the bottom of the well with the Complete Culture Medium cell suspension.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a sterile 15 mL Falcon tube with an additional 1 mL Complete Culture Medium.\nTo wash cells, pellet via centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL warm Complete Culture Medium.\nSeed ECFCs into a type I collagen-coated plate of the same size previously used and incubate at 37°C in a sterile incubator under standard conditions. This will encourage HPP-ECFC and Low Proliferative Potential-ECFC (LPP-ECFC) homogeneity and expansion without reducing cell density and causing unnecessary cell stress. For MSCs, graduate to a 12-well plate.",
    "Allow 48-h for cells to adequately adhere to their plate.\nReplenish media every 24-h for the first 5 days following adherence, and every 48-h thereon.\nRepeat passaging to a minimum of P3 before cryopreservation, seeding cells at a density of 1 × 105/cm2 from P1 onwards. Collagen coating is not required following P0. It will be possible to expand into multiple T175’s by P3, therefore allowing biobanking of approximately 2–3 million ECFCs and 5 million MSCs per flask.\nTo cryopreserve both ECFCs and MSCs, lift cells as described in steps 56–64.\nRapidly, resuspend cells at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ mL in cryopreservation solution to make a cryopreservation cell suspension.\nAliquot 1 mL cryopreservation cell suspension per cryovial and place into a Cool Cell™ Freezing Container.\nRapidly, transfer the Cool Cell™ Freezing Container to a −80°C freezer or liquid nitrogen. Cells can be stored in this condition as per standard cell cryopreservation guidelines. Refer to step 15b for thawing procedure for use in downstream assays. Refresh Complete Media every 2–3 days as per standard cell culture guidelines."
