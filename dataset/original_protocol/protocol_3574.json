Protein expression is then induced by shifting the temperature from 30°C to 42°C for 20 min then to 38°C for 3 h. Finally, the cells are harvested and frozen for later use in protein purification.\nInoculate a single colony from the plate containing E. coli BL21/ pcIts,ind+(NSP8) into 8 mL of Terrific broth with 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Incubate for 16 h with shaking at 30°C, 200 rpm.\nThe following morning pellet the cells by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min.\nDecant the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 6 mL of fresh Terrific broth with 100 μg/mL ampicillin.\nInoculate each of 2 × 1 L of Terrific broth with 100 μg/mL ampicillin, split into 2 × 2.8 L baffle-bottomed flasks, with 3 mL of the resuspended culture from step 3. Incubate the culture at 30°C with shaking at 250 rpm.\nMeasure the OD600 of the culture every 30 min until the OD600 reaches 2.\nWhen the OD600 reaches 2, remove a “pre-induction” sample by pelleting (10,000 × g, 5 min, 20°C–25°C) a volume of cells equal to 1 mL at an OD600 of 6. Aspirate the supernatant then store the pellet at −80°C.\nInduce expression by moving the cultures to an incubator preheated to 42°C for 20 min and incubate with shaking at 250 rpm.\nMove the cultures to an incubator preheated to 38°C and incubate with shaking at 250 rpm for 3 h.",
    "Measure the OD600 of the cultures. Take a post-induction sample by pelleting a volume of cells equal to 1 mL at an OD600 of 6. Decant then aspirate the remaining supernatant. Store the pellet at −80°C.\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C Decant the supernatant then transfer the pellet to a pre-weighed 50 mL conical tube with a spatula.\nDetermine the mass of the tube plus pellet then subtract the mass of the empty tube to get the yield of cell pellet. Record the mass on the tube as well as in your notes. Typical yields are 15–20 g of cell pellet per 2 L of growth media.\nStore the pellet at −80°C. The pellet is stable for at least one month at −80°C but likely is stable for longer than we have tested.\nHazard Note: Dispose of E. coli cultures as recommended by your local biosafety protocols\nExpression of SARS-CoV-2 nsp12/7/8 in E. coli\nTiming: 2.5 days\nIn this step, E coli harboring the chaperone plasmid pG-Tf2 and the RdRp complex co-expression plasmid pQE-(NSP12)-pcIts,ind+-(NSP7-NSP8) are grown to a high density before inducing expression for 16 h and harvesting the cells by centrifugation.\nInoculate a single colony from the plate with E. coli BL21/pG-Tf2/pQE-(NSP12)-pcIts,ind+ -(NSP7-NSP8) into an 8 mL starter culture of Terrific broth with 30 μg/mL kanamycin and 20 μg/mL chloramphenicol. Incubate at 30°C with shaking at 200 rpm for 16 h.\nThe following morning inoculate the starter culture into 1 L of Terrific broth with 30 μg/mL kanamycin and 20 μg/mL chloramphenicol in a 2.8 L baffle-bottomed flask and incubate with shaking at 30°C, 250 rpm.",
    "Periodically check the OD600 of the culture. When the OD600 reaches 2, take a pre-induction sample by harvesting a volume of cells equal to 1 mL at an OD600 of 6 and storing the pellet at −80°C.\nAdd tetracycline from a 10 μg/mL stock to a final concentration of 10 ng/mL and move the culture to an incubator pre-cooled to 16°C.\nIncubate with shaking at 16°C, 250 rpm for 20 min.\nAdd IPTG to 0.5 mM from a 1 M stock solution. Add nalidixic acid to 50 μg/mL from a 25 mg/mL stock.\nCritical: Make 25 mg/mL nalidixic acid stock fresh daily by dissolving the powder into 0.3 M NaOH.\nExpress for 16 h at 16°C with shaking at 250 rpm.\nMeasure the OD600. Pellet a volume of cells equal to 1 mL at an OD600 of 6 and store the pellet at −80°C.\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C.\nDecant the supernatant and transfer the pellet to a pre-weighed 50 mL conical tube with a spatula. Determine the mass of the pellet then store at −80°C.\nHazard Note: Dispose of E. coli cultures as recommended by your local biosafety protocols\nTesting expression levels from large-scale E. coli expressions\nTiming: 0.5 day\nIn this step, pre- and post-induction samples collected during protein expression are lysed and separated by SDS-PAGE to determine the level of overexpression and solubility of the proteins of interest before pursuing further purification from the large pellets. The method described here is adapted from (Brandis and Johnson, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nFor each sample to be analyzed, set up a series of 3 tubes for each time point, each containing 45 μL of Expression Test Sample Buffer. Label the tubes in each set of three as follows:\nTCP = Total Cell Protein",
    "SOL = Soluble Protein\nINS = Insoluble Protein\nThaw pellets collected pre- and post-induction from the large-scale expressions above on ice.\nAdd 200 μL of Expression Test Buffer A containing 0.3 mg/mL Lysozyme to each pellet. Vortex until the pellets have been uniformly resuspended.\nIncubate samples at 37°C for 10 min then place on ice. The solutions should be very viscous due to the chromosomal DNA that is released upon lysis.\nSonicate with the micro-tip (20% duty cycle, 0% output) for 30 – 40 bursts, ensuring the tip is always under the level of the solution in the tube. After sonication, the viscosity of the sample should be much lower.\nAdd 22.4 μL of 5 M NaCl to each sample. Seal the tubes and vortex.\nRemove 15 μL of the sonicate and transfer it to the appropriate “TCP” sample tube, containing 45 μL of Expression Test Sample Buffer.\nSpin the remainder of the sonicate in a microcentrifuge tube at 16,000 × g in a tabletop microcentrifuge for 10 min at 20°C–25°C.\nRemove 15 μL of the supernatant to the appropriate “SOL” sample tube already containing Expression Test Sample Buffer.\nAspirate off the remaining supernatant.\nAdd 400 μL of Expression Test Buffer B and resuspend the pellet using the same sonication procedure as in step 27. This is a wash step to remove any residual soluble protein from the pellet and from the walls of the tube.\nSpin the suspension at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 20°C–25°C in a tabletop microcentrifuge.\nAspirate and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 192 μL of Expression Test Buffer B to each sample and resuspend the pellets by sonication as in step 27. Usually only 10 – 12 bursts are needed to resuspend the pellet.",
    "Remove 15 μL of the resuspended pellet solution to the appropriate “INS” tube with Expression Test Sample Buffer.\nHeat all samples at 80°C–85°C for 5 min prior to loading 10 – 15 μL per lane for SDS-PAGE.\nRun SDS-PAGE gels according to the manufacturers protocol, then stain with Coomassie brilliant blue.

During sonication, check the sample every 3–5 min to ensure efficient mixing and ice cooling as the sonicator produces heat.\nAdd 4% sodium deoxycholate to a final concentration of 0.1%. Add 5 M NaCl to a final concentration of 0.5 M. Stir on ice for 30 min.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 75,000 × g for 45 min at 4°C.\nFilter the supernatants through a 0.2 μm syringe filter.",
