    "NOTE: All experimental procedures described below were approved by the Sydney Local Health District (Royal Prince Alfred Zone) Ethics Review Committee.\n1. Participant Recruitment\nRecruit participants from the institution databases and by advertising the study on the institution website and local newspapers.\n\tNOTE: Criteria that was applied for this particular study are male and female, aged 25–55 years, pre-menopausal, with a BMI ≥25 to ≤35 kg/m2.\nEnsure that potential participants are computer literate.\n2. Preparing Participants for Dietary Data Collection\nArrange an initial individual screening visit by calling each participant.\nObtain written informed consent from each participant prior to the screening visit.\nTrain participants in the use of the electronic platform.\nProvide participants with a step-by-step guide explaining how to use the electronic platform. Give participants sufficient time to read it.\nShow participants how to use the platform on the study laptop.\nAsk participants to enter in the platform some food and drink items in the presence of a trained study investigator.\nProvide participants with a traditional paper-based food diary with instructions on how to use it included. Ask them to complete it before their baseline visit.\nInstruct participants to:\nRead the instructions and the 'Example Day' (Figure 1) included in the food diary thoroughly before starting to record any food or drink.\nRecord all foods and beverages consumed for three consecutive days (two weekdays and one weekend). Ask them to report all items consumed both at home and outside home (e.g. at work or at a restaurant) and to insert them in the diary as close to the time of consumption as possible to avoid relying on memory.\nRefer to the portion sizes guide included in the food diary to estimate the measurement and amount of foods and drinks.",
    "Use the checklist of commonly forgotten foods and beverages included in the food diary to make sure no food and drink items are missing.\nRecord items consumed as specific as possible (write 'chicken thigh with skin' instead of 'chicken', or 'reduced fat milk' instead of 'milk', for example).\nIndicate the preparation methods (fried, steamed, baked, and raw, for example).\nList the brand name of food and drink products.\nInclude recipes for any unusual items prepared at home.\nInstruct participants to enter the written information recorded on the paper food diary into the electronic diaryat the end of each of the three days.\nArrange a baseline visit for each participant within one week after the screening visit.\nInstruct participants to bring the completed paper food diary at the baseline visit.\nAt the week five visit, provide participants with a new paper food diary and instruct them to complete it for another three days before the week six visit and ask them to enter the data into the electronic diary over the same three days.\n3. Written Food Diary\nNOTE: Food intake was self-reported and collected by utilizing both the traditional written paper diary method and the electronic web-based platform ('Boden Food Plate') over the same three-day period.\nCollecting the Dietary Data\n\tNOTE: Participants complete the three-day paper food diary and return them at the baseline and week six visit.\n\t\nReview the food diaries together with the participants to ensure all dietary data is legible and all of the measurements and amounts consumed are entered correctly.\nAnalysis of the Written Dietary Data\nEnter the three-day written food diary data for each participant into dietary analysis software (see Table of Materials) for the analysis of nutrient intake. The software automatically calculates the nutritional intakes.",
    "Export the calculated values for energy (kJ) and macronutrient intake (protein, fat and carbohydrate) represented in absolute grams (g) and as a percentage of total energy intake (% kJ) as the average of six days (three days at baseline and three days at the week six visit) into a spreadsheet.\nImport mean values of the six days into statistical software for analysis.\n4. Electronic Food Diary ('Boden Food Plate')\nRegistration\nSend an 'invitation email' to the study participants with the link to register a new account in the electronic platform.\nInstruct participants to follow the registration process by entering their full name, date of birth, gender, email and create a username (email address) and password to log-in to the electronic platform (Figure 2).\nInstruct participants to access the visual guide on how to use the electronic food diary from the application homepage and to read it carefully (Figure 3).\nProvide phone and email support to assist participants who encounter difficulties when completing the electronic food diary.\nTo create an electronic food diary, have study participants:\nSelect the icon with the specific project title they are invited to join (Figure 4).\nSelect 'Make a new entry' to create a new day of the electronic food diary where they can enter food and drink items using the information from the written food diary (Figure 5).\nUse the 'Search' tool to find food and drink items consumed during the day from the database (Figure 6).\nClick on the desired food and drink items and virtually drag them onto the plate to reflect the meals consumed at that time (Figure 6).",
    "Select one of the small plates at the bottom of the page to move to different meals (breakfast, morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner and supper). When the selected small plate starts to bounce, enter foods and beverages on the big plate in the middle of the screen which corresponds to the meal selected (Figure 6).\nClick the 'Save changes' button to save all entries of the day (Figure 6).\nVisualize the bar graphs showing the comparison between the automatically calculated dietary intakes and the average population dietary intakes (Figure 7) by clicking on the 'Graph' icon on the entries page (Figure 5).\n\t\tNOTE: Participants create two separate three-day electronic food diaries for the baseline and week six visit.\nPreparing dietary data for analysis\nExport the average value of energy and nutrient intakes for each participant into a spreadsheet by accessing the platform managing portal.\nImport the spreadsheet into statistical software for analysis.\nOverall satisfaction questionnaire\nAdminister a paper-based questionnaire to measure the overall satisfaction with the program for participants at week six.\nInstruct participants to score different elements of the web-based application on a scale of 0–10 (with 0 being a negative, 5 a neutral and 10 a positive evaluation), covering topics such as ease of use, completeness of the food list, and search function.\n5. Analysis of the Dietary Data\nUse only data from participants who entered three days of dietary data into the electronic platform and completed three days of written food diary at both baseline and week six visits.\nObtain macronutrient percentages.\nMultiply the total macronutrient amount (g) by kilojoules per gram (kJ/g) of macronutrient, with 17 kJ per gram for protein and carbohydrate and 37 kJ per gram for fat.",
    "Divide the value (kilojoules per total grams of macronutrient) by the total energy intake (kJ), then multiply the number obtained by 100 to find the macronutrient percentage of total energy intake (% kJ).\nCalculate mean values (±standard deviation (SD)) for total energy (kJ) and protein, fat and carbohydrate intake (in both absolute grams and as a percentage of energy intake) for the electronic and written food diaries separately.\nUse Pearson's product-moment correlation to determine the correlation between the two dietary collection methods.\nObtain percentage differences between the two data collection methods.\nSubtract the values determined for the written food diary from the electronic food diary.\nCreate Bland-Altman plots for mean total energy (kJ), protein, carbohydrate and fat intake (% kJ).\nPlot the mean values of each data collection tool (x-axis) against the difference between the methods (y-axis)15,16.\nPlot the mean difference and upper and lower interval lines (mean (±SD)*1.96). This allows for extensive examination of the agreement between the electronic and paper dietary collection methods.\n6. Analysis of the Questionnaires\nCalculate the mean (±SD) score for each question of the overall satisfaction with data derived from the questionnaire.\nSubscription Required.
