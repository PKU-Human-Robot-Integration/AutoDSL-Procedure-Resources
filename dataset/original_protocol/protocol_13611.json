    "Animal experiments are performed according to the experimental procedures approved by the institutional animal care and use committees (IACUCs) of Stanford University and the Veterans Affairs Hospital in Palo Alto. 6-8 week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed either chow or a fast-food diet supplemented with 4.2% high-fructose corn syrup (see Table of Materials) in drinking water for 14 weeks5. The mice were kept in standard cages at a 12 h dark/light cycle.\n1. Surgical preparation and procedures of liver perfusion\nWeigh the mouse before the procedure.\nAnesthetize the mouse by administering Ketamine (90 mg/kg) and Xylazine (10 mg/kg) (see Table of Materials) via an intraperitoneal injection. Ensure that the mouse is fully anesthetized by toe pinching before proceeding to the next step.\n\tNOTE: Isoflurane is not needed here since this is a non-survival surgery.\nShave the ventral area using a hair clipper and disinfect the skin with 70% ethanol. Place the mouse on its back, and immobilize the legs on the surgical board with tape.\nAfter reconfirming the depth of anesthesia by a toe-pinch, use Mayo scissors and Adson forceps (see Table of Materials) to make a 3 cm incision laterally in the lower abdomen and then a 5 cm incision vertically from the low abdomen to the xiphoid process. Be careful not to open the chest cavity.\nAfter opening the peritoneum, gently place the intestines to the animal's left, and elevate the right lobe of the liver with a Rayon tipped applicator (see Table of Materials) to expose the portal vein.\nCatheterize the portal vein using a 24 G IV catheter. Introduce the catheter into the distal end of the portal vein. Place the catheter tip before the portal vein branches out into the hepatic lobes.",
    "Withdraw the needle immediately when the catheter enters the vein. Check that the catheter is correctly positioned inside the vein by perfusing the liver with PBS using a 1mL syringe via the catheter.\n\t​NOTE: Upon PBS perfusion, all lobes should immediately blanch. If the catheter is correctly placed, venous blood will quickly flow through the catheter.\nUse Dumont micro forceps, a Castroviejo microneedle holder, and 4-0 suture (see Table of Materials) to place a stitch below the branching of the portal vein and a second stitch 1 cm below to secure the catheter.\n2. Tissue decellularization\nConnect the catheter to a silicone tubing (~1 m length, 3 mm inner diameter, and 4.1 mm outer diameter) with a Luer connector. Connect the silicone tubing to a peristaltic pump and a reservoir containing deionized water (see Table of Materials).\nCarefully remove the air bubbles inside the tube and avoid generating new bubbles during the perfusion. Set the peristaltic pump at a ﬂow output of 0.2 mL/min (i.e., 288 mL/24 h).\nPerfuse first with deionized water (~50 mL/mouse) for 2 h. The color of the liver will change from red to yellow during perfusion.\n\tNOTE: The animal will expire after 10 minutes of perfusion.\nSwitch the perfusion solution to 0.5% (wt/vol) sodium deoxycholate (DOC, see Table of Materials) and continue overnight (18 h, ~250mL/mouse).The liver will become white at the end of perfusion (Figure 1).\nSwitch the perfusion solution to deionized water (~50 mL/mouse) and perfuse for 2 h.\nUse Dumont micro forceps and micro-spring scissors (see Table of Materials) to collect the decellularized liver and wash it carefully in a Petri-dish with PBS.\nCut the decellularized tissue into small pieces for immediate imaging or freeze at -80 °C for further biochemical analysis such as tandem mass spectrometry, ELISA, or western blot.",
    "3. Slide preparation for imaging (with a multiphoton/confocal fluorescence microscope)\nTransfer a small piece of decellularized liver (<3 x 3 x 3 mm) to a microscope slide and place the tissue in the middle.\nAdd 10 µL of antifade mounting medium (see Table of Materials) to the tissue with a pipette to avoid tissue drying.\nCover the tissue with a cover glass and apply a small force to flatten the sample. Seal the edges of the cover glass with colorless and transparent nail polish (Figure 2).\n\t​NOTE: Due to the setting of the upright two-photon through the microscope, a cover glass was used on the sample. However, samples could be placed differently if an inverted microscope is used.\n4. Image acquisition\nPlace a drop of immersion oil on the top of the cover glass and place the slide on the microscope slide holder. Lower the 20x oil objective lens until it contacts the immersion oil.\nSwitch to the violet (405 nm) channel, turn on the shutter, and focus on the sample. Navigate and position the area of interest for imaging. Turn off the shutter before moving to image acquisition using laser light.\nSwitch to the computer control and start the two-photon laser. Turn on the two-photon laser first (Figure 3A), then turn on the two-photon laser controller (see Table of Materials) and shutter (Figure 3B,C). Ensure that the output power is higher than 2.5 W.\n\tReduce the laser power to prevent fluorescence quenching. Select and adjust detectors (both photomultipliers and the hybrid) to accommodate the chosen fluorophores.",
    "NOTE: Two-photon imaging was performed at an excitation wavelength of 860 nm. Two channels were selected for collagen SHG and two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) images, respectively. One channel corresponding to the wavelength range of 415-445 nm detected the detailed structure of collagen from SHG signals. Another channel covered the range of 465-669 nm to collect TPEF signals.\nChoose simultaneous or sequential image acquisitions. Adjust the pinhole to the highest value. Adjust laser wavelengths, gain, power, and offset. Adjust pixel dwell time, the pixel size, averaging, and the zoom (Figure 4A).\nScroll the computer z-controller and set the z-dimensions, define the start and endpoints, and choose the numbers of images given within a volume (z-stack). Acquire images.\n\tNOTE: Here, a 20 µm Z volume and 1 µm Z-step size was chosen (Figure 4B).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
