  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: The following protocol follows our internal guidelines and standard operation procedures approved by the chair of our department. The same protocol was approved by our institutional review board and was used for studies published in a previous paper8.\n1. Pre-ultrasound Scan Preparation\nPlace the patient in a supine position with an optional elevated head of bed or stretcher for comfort if the patient is awake.\nPosition the ultrasound machine in a line with operator´s position and the puncture site to prevent operator´s head or body twisting to see the display. Turn on the ultrasound machine and connect the micro-convex ultrasound probe.\nChoose a pre-set that allows deep tissue penetration, e.g., set probe to 8 MHz or lower. Use alcoholic disinfection on skin for acoustic coupling of the ultrasound probe.\n2. Ultrasound Scan of the CVC Insertion Site and Superior Vena Cava\nPlace the micro-convex ultrasound probe on the puncture site.\n\tNOTE: A B(rightness)-mode short axis view and out of plane puncture technique is preferred. Adjust gain, depth and focus position for an optimal image.\nConfirm vein by applying pressure to test for compressibility and to exclude thrombus at puncture site. Use color flow doppler if there is uncertainty. Move ultrasound probe centrally to detect potential thrombus.\n3. Supraclavicular Fossa Ultrasound View\nPlace the ultrasound probe in the right supraclavicular fossa to obtain a view of the confluence of the internal jugular vein and subclavian vein to detect a potential thrombus. Change gain, depth and focus using knobs of the ultrasound machine.\n\tNOTE: Set gain high enough to differentiate between hyperechoic vessel walls and hypoechoic vessel lumen. Set depth (10-12 cm) to have a full view of the SVC and right pulmonary artery (RPA). Set the Focus to the level of the RPA.",
    "Increase depth (4-6 cm) using the knob of the ultrasound machine to obtain a view of the confluence of the brachiocephalic veins. This will also correspond to the beginning of the upper superior vena cava. Adjust depth (10-12 cm) and angulation of the ultrasound probe to obtain a full longitudinal view of the superior vena cava, adjacent ascending aorta and right pulmonary artery.\n\tNOTE: Probe frequency will be adjusted by the ultrasound machine depending on depth of imaging.\nEvaluate the brachiocephalic veins and the superior vena cava for intravenous thrombus. Turn the ultrasound probe 90° clockwise to obtain a sagittal view of the superior vena cava. Observe the right pulmonary artery in short axis dorsal of the lower superior vena cava. Additionally, observe a short axis view of the pulmonary veins distal of the right pulmonary artery. Use optional Doppler to confirm superior vena cava.\n4. Ultrasound Guided Venipuncture\nPrepare CVC kit and dress with sterile gown and gloves. Disinfect skin with alcohol wipes and apply sterile drapes. Insert ultrasound probe into a sterile cover. Ultrasound guided venipuncture can be performed in non-sedated as well as in anesthetized patients.\n\tNOTE: For non-sedated patients a local infiltration anesthesia before venipuncture is highly recommended.\nObtain an ultrasound view of the vein to be punctured. Right-handed operators use the needle attached to a syringe in the right hand and the ultrasound probe in the left hand.\nPerform a venipuncture under ultrasound guidance.\n\tNOTE: Out of plane and in plane techniques are both appropriate.\nFollowing venipuncture, insert the guidewire through the needle. At this point, a long axis view of the vein can confirm the guidewire within the vein.\n5. Ultrasound Guided Guidewire Advancement",
    "Switch ultrasound probe to the right hand. Obtain a view of the superior vena cava by adjusting depth and focus position of the ultrasound image (Figure 3A and supplemental video loop).\n\tNOTE: This has to be done by an assisting person or by the operator himself if the ultrasound machine is operated with a sterile cover. Angulation of the ultrasound probe needs to be in a small angle in relation to neck.\nAdvance the guidewire with the left hand. Do not introduce the guidewire too far into the superior vena cava because this will make it difficult to identify the guidewire tip. Visualize the guidewire J-tip during advancement and crossing of the upper wall of the right pulmonary artery (Figure 3B).\nIf the ultrasound beam cannot be aligned with the J-tip and the right pulmonary artery, use the ascending aorta as a landmark. Turn the ultrasound probe 90° clockwise to obtain a sagittal view of the superior vena cava. With this view, confirm the guidewire position relative to the right pulmonary artery observed in the short axis.\n6. Measurement of Insertion Depth\nUse the central venous catheter to measure the insertion depth of the guidewire. In order to do so, align the 20 cm markings of the CVC and the guidewire and read the cm marking at the venipuncture site.\n\tNOTE: The guidewire has markings at 10, 20 cm and at the position indicating that the J-tip leaves the distal lumen. These markings may be different depending on the manufacturer. Be careful not to move the guidewire.\n\tNOTE: From this point on, complete placement according to standard hospital protocol, including dilation of skin and vein, insertion of the CVC over guidewire, aspiration and flushing and suture.\n7. Lung Ultrasound",
    "In the perioperative setting, perform a lung ultrasound examination in the patient to exclude pneumothorax following CVC placement.\n\tNOTE: This procedure has been described by Lichtenstein et al.11.\nPlace the ultrasound probe in all four quadrants of the anterior chest bilaterally to obtain view in B-mode for lung sliding and M-mode for seashore sign. Preferably use a linear ultrasound probe. For obese patients, use an ultrasound probe with higher penetration, e.g., curved array or micro-convex probes.\n8. Central Venous Catheter Change Over Guidewire\nNOTE: CVC change over guidewire is a single contributor to catheter-related blood stream infection and should be avoided. In patients with a high risk of mechanical complication related to CVC insertion or limited venous access, CVC change over guidewire still can be considered12.\nIn case of a misplaced central venous catheter (not using the ultrasound guided tip position method), obtain a supraclavicular view to advance the guidewire into the correct position. Under sterile conditions, introduce a guidewire into the distal lumen of the misplaced central venous catheter. Change of a CVC over a guidewire with ultrasound guidance works in non-sedated patients as well as in anesthetized patients.\n\t\nPull back the central venous catheter. Visualize the guidewire from thesupraclavicular fossa view.\nAdvance the guidewire into the correct position in the superior vena cava. Introduce the new central venous catheter over the guidewire.\nFrom this point on, complete procedure according to standard hospital protocol.\nSubscription Required.
