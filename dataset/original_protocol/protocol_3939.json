    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolation of total RNA\nTiming: 1 h\nIn this step, total RNA is isolated from the cells using PureLink RNA Mini Kit. Prepare the buffers in the kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol before starting the experiment.\nSample harvest and homogenization\nRemove medium from cells and rinse with 1× PBS (e.g., 5 mL for 60 mm plates).\nAdd 350 μL of PureLink Lysis buffer to the plate. Scrape the cell lysate thoroughly using a cell scraper.\nTransfer the viscous liquid into a new 1.5 mL tube.\nPause point: Samples can be frozen at −80°C.\nHomogenize the sample with a 23G syringe needle. Repeat the suction-release step 5–10 times.\nNote: Try not to generate too many bubbles during homogenization (samples can overflow the tubes).\nPurification of total RNA\nAdd 350 μL of 70% ethanol to sample (Sample: 70% ethanol = 1:1) and vortex.\nTransfer 700 μL of the sample into the PureLink Spin cartridge and centrifuge for 15 s at 12,000 × g at 25°C. Discard the flow through.\nAdd 700 μL of PureLink Wash Buffer I and centrifuge for 15 s at 12,000 × g at 25°C. Discard the flow through.\nAdd 500 μL of PureLink Wash Buffer II and centrifuge for 15 s at 12,000 × g at 25°C. Discard the flow through. Repeat the step twice.\nCentrifuge the column for 2 min at 12,000 × g to ensure complete removal of the wash buffer.\nTransfer the column to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nNote: Leave the column on the tube for 5 min to evaporate any residual ethanol from the wash buffer.\nAdd 50 μL nuclease-free water directly to the column matrix and incubate for 5 min.",
    "Centrifuge for 2 min at 12,000 × g at 25°C. The flow through contains total RNA.\nPause point: Samples can be frozen at −80°C.\nMeasure RNA concentration using Nanodrop with absorbance at 260 nm.\nNote: 80–90% confluent HEK293E cells from a 60 mm plate result in >75 μg total RNA.\nPurification of mRNA using Oligo(dT) beads\nTiming: 3 h\nIn this step, polyadenylated [poly(A)] mRNA is isolated from total RNA using oligo(dT) beads. Except heat block and ice incubation steps, all procedures are performed at 25°C. When not in the reaction (i.e., while preparing beads or kits), RNA samples should be kept on ice. Before starting the experiment, bring the oligo(dT) Binding and oligo(dT) Wash buffers to 25°C, and reconstitute the buffers in the Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator kit.\nPreparation of RNA\nSpin down the samples.\nAdjust the sample amount to contain 50 μg of total RNA in 100 μL nuclease-free water.\nHeat the samples in dry heat block at 65°C for 2 min to disrupt RNA secondary structures.\nPlace the sample on ice immediately.\nNote: Rapid cool down of the heated RNA samples is the key to minimize secondary structures for efficient binding of RNAs with Oligo(dT) beads.\nPreparation of Oligo(dT) beads\nResuspend Oligo(dT) beads (vortex >30 s or tilt for 5 min).\nTransfer beads to a new 1.5 mL tube. Use 250 μg beads for 50 μg total RNA.\nNote: For example, the concentration of NEB #S1419S bead suspension is 5 mg/mL. Use 50 μL of NEB #S1419S bead suspension to get 250 μg beads.\nAdd 0.5 mL Oligo(dT) Binding Buffer to the beads and rinse by pipetting.\nPlace the tube on the magnetic rack until the solution is clear (i.e., incubate for 1 min on the magnetic rack).\nCarefully remove the supernatant using a pipette.",
    "Note: Do not use aspirator to prevent loss of the beads.\nAdd 200 μL Oligo(dT) Binding Buffer to the beads and mix well.\nIsolation of mRNA\nAdd 100 μL RNA solution (prepared in step 4) to 200 μL Oligo(dT) bead suspension (i.e., RNA solution: Bead suspension = 1:2). Mix thoroughly by pipetting.\nIncubate the samples in Thermomixer for 5 min with agitation at 800 rpm at 25°C.\nPlace the tube on the magnetic rack until the solution is clear, and then remove the supernatant.\nWash the mRNA-bead complex with 200 μL Oligo(dT) Wash Buffer by pipetting.\nNote: When handling multiple samples, stagger steps 6a–6d to decrease differences in bead incubation times among the samples.\nIncubate on the magnetic rack and remove the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 6d and 6e.\nTo discard the wash buffer completely, centrifuge at 200 × g for 10 s at 25°C.\nNote: Do not centrifugate the beads at speeds higher than 200 × g. Place the tube in a metal rack and remove the residual wash buffer.\nElution\nAdd 50 μL of Oligo(dT) Elution Buffer to the beads. Mix well by pipetting.\nTo elute mRNA from the beads, heat the samples at 75°C for 2 min.\nImmediately place the tube on the magnetic rack and incubate until the solution is clear.\nTransfer the supernatant (i.e., eluted mRNAs) to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nPause point: Samples can be frozen at −80°C.\nRepeat one more round of Oligo(dT) purification (i.e., steps 4–7) to achieve higher mRNA purity.\nPause point: Samples can be frozen at −80°C.\nConduct RNA clean-up using Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator kit to remove residual salts from mRNA samples for the m6A processing step.\nAdd 100 μL Zymo RNA Binding Buffer to 50 μL mRNA sample and mix (RNA Binding Buffer: mRNA sample = 2:1).",
    "Note: To decrease variations in the isolated mRNA amount among the samples, use same amount of total RNA as a starting material (e.g., Adjust total RNA amount as 50 μg across all samples).\nAdd 150 μL of 100% ethanol and mix (mRNA-RNA Binding Buffer: 100% ethanol = 1:1)\nTransfer the sample to the Zymo Spin cartridge.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 30 s at 25°C. Discard the flow through.\nAdd 400 μL Zymo RNA Prep Buffer to the column and centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 30 s at 25°C. Discard the flow through.\nAdd 700 μL Zymo RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 30 s at 25°C. Discard the flow through.\nAdd 400 μL Zymo RNA Wash Buffer to the column and centrifuge for 2 min to completely remove the wash buffer.\nTransfer the column carefully into a new 1.5 mL tube.\nNote: Leave the column on the tube for 5 min to evaporate any residual ethanol from the wash buffer.\nAdd 15 μL nuclease-free water directly to the column matrix and incubate for 5 min.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 × g for 30 s at 25°C. The flow through contains purified mRNA.\nPause point: Samples can be frozen at −80°C.\nMeasure mRNA concentration using Nanodrop with absorbance at 260 nm. 50 μg of total RNA results in >300 ng mRNA.\nProcessing of mRNA samples for m6A analysis\nTiming: 5 h",
    "In this step, nuclease P1 hydrolyzes phosphodiester bonds in mRNA to generate nucleoside 5′-monophosphates (nucleotides). Nucleotides are further processed with alkaline phosphatase to remove phosphate groups for LC-MS analysis. Efficient enzymatic processing is critical for the LC-MS to accurately detect each nucleoside signal. Use 100–200 ng of mRNAs for sample processing. Include negative control (water-only sample) to estimate and subtract background signals.\nNuclease P1 digestion\nIn each sample tube, add the components listed below. Make a master mix and distribute to the samples to reduce pipetting error.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_907_8.csv\nVortex briefly and spin down the samples.\nIncubate the samples in Thermomixer for 2 h at 37°C with agitation at 800 rpm for 30 s every 5 min.\nPhosphatase treatment\nAdd 2 μL of 2 M ammonium bicarbonate solution.\nVortex briefly and spin down the samples.\nAdd 1 unit of alkaline phosphatase.\nVortex briefly and spin down the samples.\nIncubate the samples in Thermomixer for 2 h at 37°C with agitation at 800 rpm for 30 s every 5 min.\nRe-neutralization of the solution\nTo neutralize the reaction, add 1 μL of 1.2 M HCl. Vortex briefly to mix the samples.\nCentrifuge the samples for 30 min at 16,000 × g at 4°C to precipitate any insoluble parts.\nTransfer 20 μL supernatant to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nPause point: Samples can be frozen at −80°C.\nLC-MS analysis of m6A\nTiming: 1 h\nPreparation of LC-MS samples\nMix 20 μL of the purified nucleoside samples with 40 μL of acetonitrile.\nNote: This is to have a similar proportion of organic solvent in the LC-MS sample with the starting LC mobile phase (75% acetonitrile).\nCentrifuge the samples at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to precipitate any insoluble parts.\nCarefully transfer 40 μL of supernatant to a new LC-MS vial.",
    "Note: Do not touch the pellet.\nInject 3 μL of samples to the LC-MS system with the setting parameters described above.\nNote: The 3 μL sample now contains ∼4.5 ng mRNA if the m6A processing was performed with 200 ng mRNA as a starting material.\nRun m6A and adenosine standards in the same LC-MS setting with the samples."
