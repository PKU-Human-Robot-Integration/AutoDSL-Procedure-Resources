    "Prepare fresh ACSF 1× (see Recipe section below).Setup instruments and solutions for brain slice preparation (see Note 2 and Figure 1G).Fill the slice maintenance chamber with ACSF, deliver 95% O2 + 5% CO2 through a small glass capillary (same as those used to pull patch clamp pipettes, Figure 1D), and place the chamber in the thermostatically controlled water bath at 32°C.Place a glass bottle containing ~20 ml ACSF in a tray filled with ice and oxygenate (95% O2 + 5% CO2) the solution using a gas-diffusing stone for at least 20 min (see Note 1).Mount a perfusion tubing onto the peristaltic pump. Place the suction end into the oxygenated ice-cold ACSF and mount a 25 G needle at the opposite end.Fill the vibratome tray with ice. Mount the vibratome buffer chamber (which will receive the specimen plate; see Section F).Take 200 ml sucrose-containing cutting solution (kept at 4°C) and fill the vibratome buffer chamber. Oxygenate the cutting solution with 95% O2 + 5% CO2.Prepare a 10-cm glass Petri dish filled with ice and capped with its own lid. Place a paper filter disk over the lid and wet the filter with 2-3 ml ice-cold cutting solution.Prepare a 2% agarose cube (~1 cm3 in volume; see Note 6).Animal anesthesiaUse a stock ketamine/xylazine mixture (see Recipes section below), adjusting the volume of injection according to the mouse weight (in our experiments, we injected ~300 µl in 25- to 30-day-old mice of both genders).Perform an intraperitoneal injection of the anesthetic solution, then put the mouse back in the cage.Carefully monitor the status of anesthesia before proceeding with transcardiac perfusion. Correctly anesthetized mice should be completely unresponsive to paw pinching. Do not proceed with cardiac perfusion until the animal is completely anesthetized.",
    "Transcardiac perfusionSet the speed of the peristaltic pump so that 1-2 drops per second of ice-cold ACSF flow through the 25 G needle (if using a Gilson minipuls 3, a speed of 4.5 is recommended). Before continuing, be sure that no bubbles are present in the perfusion tubing line.Place the mouse (ventral side facing up) on a polystyrene tray covered with aluminum foil.To facilitate the surgical procedure, fix the mouse limbs to the tray using syringe needles.Pour a few ml 70% ethanol on the mouse abdomen to prevent fur dispersion.Using forceps (e.g., Dumont #3c), lift the skin of the mouse at the level of the liver and use fine scissors to perform a V-shaped cut through the abdominal wall, starting from beneath the rib cage to the collarbone to expose the liver and the diaphragm (Figure 3A).Carefully separate the liver from the diaphragm using blunt forceps.Using sharp scissors, make a small incision at the center of the diaphragm and cut from side to side to expose the pleural cavity.While lifting the sternum, cut the sternopericardial ligament to separate the heart from the bone.Holding the heart with blunt forceps, insert the perfusion needle into the left ventricle (Figure 3A).Once the needle is in place, cut the right atrium of the heart with Vannas spring scissors (avoid touching the descending aorta).Increase the speed of the peristaltic pump to 5 ml/min. The animal will be correctly perfused when the liver and limbs have turned pale white (taking approximately 20-30 s starting from the moment the perfusion speed is raised).Brain collectionRemove the head of the mouse using surgical scissors. Place the head onto the ice-filled glass Petri dish.Expose the skull by cutting the mouse skin from the neck to the nose tip. Remove skin and muscle residues using fine forceps (Dumont #5) (Figure 3B).",
    "Use fine scissors to cut the skull at the level of the lambda and remove the cerebellum and occipital bone (Figure 3B).Use fine scissors to carefully cut along the lateral part of the skull starting from the most posterior part of the parietal bone to the eye socket. Subsequently, cut the nasal bone from side to side at the level of the anterior frontal bone suture (Figure 3B).Using fine forceps, peel away the dorsal part of the skull. If performed correctly, minimal strength is sufficient to detach the skull and expose the brain.Insert a small flat spatula at the level of the olfactory bulbs and separate the brain from the base of the skull in the rostro-caudal direction. Cut the cranial nerves in the most ventral part, and carefully detach the anterior part of the brain.Trim any residual connection of the brain with the skull and delicately drop the brain into a 50-ml beaker filled with oxygenated, ice-cold ACSF.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4109/bioprotoc-11-15-4109-g003.jpgFigure 3.

Preparation of SNc coronal slices using a vibratome and slice collection in a mantainance chamber.",
    "Pick up the brain from the ACSF solution using a spoon and lay it onto the ice-filled glass Petri dish (with the ventral part touching the filter paper disk).Using a scalpel, perform a coronal cut at the level of the striatum and a second coronal incision to remove the residual cerebellum (Figure 3C). Be careful not to cut the midbrain region containing the SNc.Pour 1-2 drops superglue at the center of the vibratome specimen plate and spread to form a thin layer. The layer surface should be large enough to host the brain block and the agarose cube.Lift the brain with a spatula and carefully remove the residual ACSF using absorbent paper.Lay the brain onto the glue on the vibratome specimen plate, with the posterior coronal plane facing up.Glue the 2% agarose cube close to the cortices (i.e., behind the brain block). This will help to keep the brain steady and firm throughout the cutting process (Figure 1H).Insert and lock the specimen plate into the vibratome buffer chamber with the ventral side of the brain facing the blade (such that the SNc will be closer to the blade; Figure 1H).Set the vibratome frequency at approximately 85 Hz, slice thickness at 250 μm, and advance speed at 0.15 mm/s. Start cutting the tissue.Discard all slices that do not contain the SNc.Approximately 4-5 slices containing the SNc will be obtained with these cutting settings (Figure 1L).Note: We advise using Sylvius aqueduct and hippocampal formation as supplementary elements to clearly define the anteroposterior coronal plane (Figure 4). Transfer the brain slices containing the SNc into the maintenance chamber at 32°C and allow them to recover for 30 min. Cover the chamber with a plastic lid.",
    "To handle the slices, use a plastic Pasteur pipette (Figure 1I) previously cut at 2/3 of its length or a fine brush (the use of a brush requires particular attention to avoid pinching the tissue with the bristles).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4109/bioprotoc-11-15-4109-g004.jpgFigure 4. Schematic representation of coronal sections containing the SNc. Arrows point to SNc areas (green) through different cutting planes. Light blue outlines the Sylvius aqueduct.In this section, we will discuss the experimental setup used in a recent study published by our lab (Regoni et al., 2020).Cell-attached and whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiologyTurn on the perfusion system of the electrophysiology setup so that oxygenated ACSF will continuously flow in the recording chamber at a rate of 2-3 ml/min. Turn on a suction system (vacuum- or peristaltic pump-driven) to maintain a constant level of liquid in the recording chamber.Turn on the bath temperature controller and set it to 32°C. Wait until the ACSF temperature in the bath has reached the desired level.If multiple drug concentrations are to be tested, prepare the proper volume of oxygenated ACSF supplemented with the different drug concentrations. In our custom-made perfusion setup, we used three 50-ml syringes connected to a Luer-lok 3-way manifold system that could be easily switched on/off according to the experimental protocol.Carefully position an SNc-containing slice in the recording chamber and fix it to the chamber bottom using the U-shaped anchor (Figure 1M).Visually identify the SNc using a 4× objective (Figure 5A). As previously mentioned, use the Sylvius aqueduct and hippocampal formation as supplementary elements to clearly define the antero-posterior coronal plane of the brain slice.Switch to a larger objective (40×) to visually identify dopaminergic neurons. These cells are packed next to each other within a relatively narrow area at the edge of the SNr.",
    "As shown in Figure 5A, dopaminergic neurons display an ovoidal, elongated soma (longer axis of about 20 μm) and are easily recognizable.Fill a patch-clamp pipette with the internal solution, remove any air bubbles, and load it on the electrode holder (see Note 4 and Figure 1E, F).Apply slight positive pressure to the pipette tip before moving toward the brain slice.Using the micromanipulator, gently move the pipette toward the cell, while continuously monitoring the pipette tip resistance. Upon touching the cell membrane, the pipette resistance progressively increases, and a small indentation of the membrane beneath the pipette tip becomes visible.Quickly remove the positive pressure.Carefully apply slight and continuous negative pressure until the resistance increases to at least 1 GΩ (giga-seal), reaching a cell-attached configuration.Dopaminergic cells of the SNc spontaneously fire action potentials in a pace-making fashion. Cell firing will be stable approximately 2 min after obtaining a cell-attached configuration. Under our conditions, the DA neuronal spontaneous firing pattern is mostly regular, with a mean firing frequency of 1.75 ± 0.18 Hz in WT animals (Regoni et al., 2020) (Figure 5C).Pharmacological studies on drugs able to modify the firing pattern of these cells can be performed by acutely switching the perfusion from control to drug-supplemented ACSF at different concentrations.Finally, move into whole-cell patch clamp configuration by quickly applying brief negative pressure to the pipette to open the cell membrane (“break-in”).At this stage, current-clamp experiments can be performed to univocally identify the firing pattern of DA neurons, as shown in Figure 5C (see also Figure 5D and Note 5). This step is necessary because different types of cells in the SNc are able to fire action potentials spontaneously.",
    "Cell recognition may be ambiguous in the cell-attached configuration; thus, whole-cell recordings are required to better detect membrane potential responses to hyperpolarizing current steps (namely, a prominent and fast Ih-mediated depolarizing sag that is typical of DA cells). Firing and electrical membrane parameters of SNc TH+ neurons are summarized in Table 1.Table 1. Firing and electrical membrane parameters of SNc TH+ neuronsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210730/20210730181430_4517.png Data are given as the mean ± S.E.M.
