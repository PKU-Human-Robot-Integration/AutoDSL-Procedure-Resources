    "1. Plating HC11 Cells\nIn a laminar flow hood using sterile techniques prepare a bottle with 50 mL of HC11 cell medium: RPMI-1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 5 μg/mL insulin, and 10 ng/mL EGF (see Table of Materials).\nPlate approximately 400,000 cells per 3 cm Petri dish: Pass two 10 cm, 50% confluent Petri dishes into twenty 3 cm dishes in HC11 medium. The cells must be well spread out but drying must be avoided.\n\t\nAspirate the medium into a flask using a vacuum pump.\nAdd 250 µL of trypsin (see Table of Materials) per 10 cm plate. Swirl and hit the plate from the sides while keeping it horizontal to spread the trypsin and to dislodge the attached cells\nObserve under phase contrast microscopy with a 4x objective to make sure the cells have started to detach from the edges before pipetting.\nAspirate approximately 1.5 mL of HC11 medium in a sterile, 9 inch Pasteur pipette and squirt it vertically against the cells. Rotate the Petri dish while squirting to dislodge all cells. You must work fast to avoid drying of the cells.\nTransfer all cells to the bottle with the HC11 medium and swirl.\nPipette 2 mL of cell suspension in each 3 cm Petri dish. Rock the Petri dishes crosswise to spread evenly. Place the cells in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nThe next day, or when cells are ~90–100% confluent, aspirate the medium, and replace it with medium with FBS and insulin but lacking EGF.\n2. Differentiation Induction, Monitoring, and Quantitation of HC11 Cells",
    "After growing the cells in medium lacking EGF for 24 h, add the differentiation medium (HIP medium) to ten 3 cm plates: RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 μg/mL Hydrocortisone (see Table of Materials), 5 μg/mL Insulin and 5 μg/mL Prolactin (see Table of Materials) for up to 10 days.\nKeep the other ten 3 cm plates as controls: Change to a medium with 10% FBS and 5 μg/mL insulin lacking EGF and HIP.\nChange the medium every 2–3 days to both HIP-treated cells and controls. Pipette the medium carefully to make sure that cells do not detach.\nTo monitor differentiation (i.e., the formation of \"domes\"), observe the cells under phase contrast microscopy (Figure 1A, left panel). If the cells are expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP), observe under fluorescence microscopy (excitation = 485/20; emission = 530/25; magnification 240x; 20x objective) (Figure 1A, right panel).\nTo quantitate the degree of differentiation, extract proteins from one Petri dish each of HIP-treated cells and controls, once a day for a total of 10 days and probe Western blots for β-casein (see Table of Materials) (Figure 1B).\n\t\nScrape the cells on ice with 1.5 mL ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) into a 1.8 ml plastic centrifuge tube.\nPellet the cells at 350 x g, 1 min, 4 °C.\nQuickly wash the pellet 2x with ice-cold PBS. Drain any residue.\nMake a lysis buffer: 50 mM HEPES (pH = 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10 mM Na4P2O7, 1% NP-40, 100 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, 0.5 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 μg/mL aprotinin, 10 μg/mL leupeptin16. Add 100 µL per 3 cm Petri dish.\nClarify the lysate by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 10 min in the cold.",
    "Determine protein concentration (see Table of Materials) and load 10–20 µg of protein from each sample onto a 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gel.\nElectrophorese for 15 h at 45 V, or at 100 V for ~2–2.5 h.\nTransfer onto a nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane using an electroblotting transfer apparatus (see Table of Materials).\nBlock with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST).\nAdd the primary antibody, goat anti-β-casein diluted 1:2,000 or mouse anti-β actin diluted 1:1,000 (see Table of Materials).\nWash 3x with TBST, 5 min each time.\nAdd the secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) linked donkey anti-goat diluted 1:2,500, or HRP linked horse anti-mouse antibody diluted 1:10,000.\nWash 3x with TBST, 5 min each time.\nAdd ECL reagents to the membrane according to the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials).\n3. Plating and 3D Growth of EpH4 Cells in EHS Matrix\nNOTE: The matrix is liquid at temperatures <10 °C and solid at temperatures above. Store at -80 °C. Thaw at 4 °C the night before use. Pre-chill the tissue culture plates and pipette tips at -20 °C prior to handling and keep the matrix, plates, and pipette tips on ice to prevent it from solidifying.\nGrow EpH4 cells in 2D in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS and 5 µg/mL insulin (EGF is not required).\nPrepare EpH4 growth medium supplemented with 10% (v/v, 3,500 µL) or 20% (v/v 2,000 µL) matrix in two 50 mL conical tubes. Keep on ice until ready to use.\nCoat 10 wells (1 cm2 each) of a 24 well plate with 150 μL of undiluted matrix. Spread the matrix using a pipette tip. Avoid creating bubbles. Gently tap the sides of the plate while holding it horizontally to ensure that the matrix is evenly distributed across the bottom of the well.",
    "Incubate the 24 well plate at 37 °C for 1 h to allow the matrix to solidify.\nTrypsinize EpH4 cells as described above for HC11 cells and count them with a hemocytometer. Transfer 5 x 104 cells per well to a 1.5 mL sterile conical centrifuge tube and spin at 250 x g for 5 min.\nCarefully aspirate the medium and place the tube on ice.\nResuspend cells in 350 µL of EpH4 growth medium supplemented with 20% matrix using a 1 mL pipette tip while keeping the conical tube on ice. Avoid bubbles. It is important to ensure a single cell suspension.\nOnce the bottom layer matrix has solidified (the matrix should appear translucent and lighter in color compared to the initial coating of the wells), add the 350 µL of cell suspension to each coated well and place in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C for ~1 h to allow the 20% matrix layer to solidify.\n\t\nObserve the cells microscopically under phase contrast with a 4x objective. Single cells should be visible.\nAdd 200 µL of EpH4 medium containing 10% matrix on top of the 350 µL of cells suspended in 20% matrix. Incubate at 37 °C.\n4. Differentiation Induction of EpH4 Cells Grown in 3D (Figure 2)\nNOTE: Besides differentiation, EpH4 cells can also undergo tubulogenesis when stimulated with HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) in 3D culture. Tubular outgrowths can be seen after 10 days of HIP and HGF stimulation.\nBegin differentiation induction of EpH4 cells 1 day after plating in the matrix. Carefully remove 150 µL of top medium containing 10% matrix from the wells using a plastic pipette tip. Add 200 µL of EpH4 medium containing HIP and 10% matrix.",
    "Replace the 10% matrix-HIP medium every 2 days for up to 10 days. Grow control cells in the same 10% matrix medium without HIP.\nMonitor mammosphere formation under phase contrast (Figure 3A, lower panel).\n5. Tubulogenesis Induction of EpH4 Cells Grown in 3D (Figure 3A and 3C)\nPrepare 24 well plates and EpH4 cells for growth in matrix as detailed in steps 3.1–3.9. The day after plating the cells in the matrix, remove 150 µL of EpH4 medium containing 10% matrix from the wells using a plastic pipette tip. Add 200 µL of EpH4 medium containing 10% matrix, HIP, and 20 ng/mL HGF (see Table of Materials).\nReplace the 10% matrix/HIP/HGF medium every 2 days for up to 12–14 days.\nMonitor tubule formation microscopically using a 20x or 40x objective (Figure 3A, right panel).\n6. Quantitation of Differentiation: Western Blotting for β-casein\nCarefully pipette off the 10% matrix-HIP medium from the wells. Rinse the 20% matrix layer 2x with 350 µL of ice-cold PBS. The spheroids should still be present in the matrix layer.\nAdd 700–1,000 µL of ice-cold PBS with 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) directly into the wells. Gently detach the bottom layer of the 100% matrix from the well with a pipette tip to recover spheroids present in that layer. Shake gently for 30 min at 4 °C.\nCarefully transfer the spheroid suspension to a conical tube. Rinse the wells with ~500 µL of PBS-EDTA to recover any remaining spheroids in the wells and add to the conical tube.\nRock on ice for an additional 30 min. Make sure the matrix has fully dissolved. If visible matrix clumps are seen, add more PBS-EDTA or shake longer.\nCentrifuge the solution to pellet the spheroids at 350 x g for 5 min.",
    "Aspirate the supernatant, lyse the spheroids in ice-cold lysis buffer, and probe for β-casein, cyclin D1, and p120RasGAP by Western blotting as in step 2.5 above16. As primary antibodies, use goat anti-β-casein diluted 1:2,000, rabbit anti-cyclin D1 diluted 1:2,000, and mouse anti-p120 diluted 1:2,000. For secondary antibodies, use HRP linked donkey anti-goat diluted 1:2,500, HRP linked donkey anti-rabbit diluted 1:2,500, and HRP linked horse anti-mouse diluted 1:10,000.\nSubscription Required.
