    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNanoluciferase binding assay\nTiming: >3 hours, depending on pre-treatments that may need to be performed\nVirus and VLPs bearing nanoluciferase-tagged-vpr are bound to target host cells at entry non-permissive temperatures and the resulting nanoluciferase signal read on a plate reader. For HIV, temperatures below 22°C do not support efficient fusion and cell entry. Thus, virus that is bound and attached to the cell surface can be quantified. This protocol is an updated, optimized version of the viral binding assay described by Janas and Wu (2009).9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nNote: Prior to performing a binding assay, the sensitivity of the plate reader as well as the dynamic range of the nanoluciferase containing particles should be assessed. This is detailed within the technical manual for the Promega Nano-Glo Luciferase Assay System.\nWhere necessary, pretreat the cells or virus/VLP mixes with the chosen drug/competimer/ compound etc prior to starting this assay.\nInclude all necessary controls, such as a mock (cells only, with no virus or VLP) and an untreated control (untreated cells with untreated virus or VLP).\nWhere possible include a trypsin control (untreated cells with untreated virus or VLP that are treated with trypsin after binding).\nWhen investigating glycan mediated binding responses, a suitable negative control involves PNGase F treatment of virus or VLPs.\nNote: The trypsin control above will allow an estimation of the proportion of virus or VLPs that are either internalised into the cell during the binding assay or those that are protected from proteolytic activity. A high nanoluciferase signal obtained for these samples would suggest that either the cells are internalising bound virus/VLPs or the trypsin treatment has not been effective and the length of treatment needs to be optimised.",
    "Troubleshooting: To reduce high trypsin control signals, review the handling steps to ensure that entry non-permissive temperatures are always maintained. Alternatively, the trypsin treatment has not been effective in removing the bound particles. Refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section below.\nNote: Recombinant PNGase F is an amidase able to cleave N-linked glycans. New England Biosciences PNGase F (P0708) is guaranteed to be endoglycosidase F1-, F2- and F3-free. When using this treatment as a control in these assays we have used the manufacturer’s supplied glycobuffer2 that maintains native conditions.\nFor our PBMC based assays we use 1 × 106 PBMCs per treatment.\nPrepare the cells by determining the cell density and resuspend the cells at 1 × 106 cells/mL in fresh, complete RPMI.\nAliquot 1 mL of cells into the appropriate number of screw-cap tubes needed for the experiment.\nJust before the experiment is started, centrifuge the cells at 200 g for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nCarefully remove 900 μL of media from each tube, ensuring that the cell pellet remains undisturbed.\nGently resuspend the cells by tapping the tubes or by gentle, brief vortexing.\nStand the tubes at 4°C for 10–15 min. Ensure that the rack allows sufficient cooling and does not insulate the tubes.\nEnsure that the virus or VLP stocks being used for the assay are cool and on ice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Where possible, cool all consumables, including pipette tips in the refrigerator.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3072-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Cartoon schematic of the nanoluciferase binding assay\nFrom this point forward, work on ice and maintain all buffers at 4°C.\nMix the virus or VLPs into their respective cell containing tubes.\nPipette the cell and virus/VLP mixes at least five times up and down to mix. Do not vortex.\nPlace the tubes immediately back on ice, in the refrigerator.",
    "Incubate for 20 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nNote: For our binding assays using infectious NL4-3 virus a p24CA equivalent of 50 ng results in a strong nanoluciferase signal. For our bindings assays using pNL4-3 ΔRTΔINΔVifΔVpr VLPs a p24CA equivalent of 100 ng was suitable. These values were used based on the dynamic range of the nanoluciferase on our Tecan MP200 Pro reader.\nAdd 1 mL ice-cold HBSS to each tube followed by centrifugation at 100 g, 4°C, 3–5 min.\nWash the cell and virus/VLP mixes at least three times using ice-cold HBSS buffer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Wash with 1 mL of HBSS per tube, per wash. Take care not to disturb the cell pellet when removing the HBSS wash.\nNote: When washing the cell pellets do not attempt to remove all of the HBSS wash buffer between washes. Allow approximately 50 μL to remain in the tube. PBMC cell pellets tend to be loose and cells can be inadvertently removed when trying to clear all of the HBSS. Where a researcher is concerned that their cells have not been adequately washed, they can increase the number of washes to five.\nIf a trypsin control is being included, add 50–100 μL 0.25% trypsin (EDTA free) to this sample after the initial HBSS washes.\nIncubate this tube at 37°C for 4 min.\nAdd 800 μL cold, complete RPMI to dilute and inactivate the trypsin.\nImmediately wash the cells with ice-cold HBSS at least three times, as detailed above.\nNote: The length of time required for the trypsin treatment may need to be optimised for the assay conditions in use. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] points for potential solutions.\nAfter the final wash, resuspend the cell pellets in 100 μL 1 x cell lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and 1% NP40 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).",
    "Note: 1 x Cell lysis buffer can be prepared ahead of the experiment and stored indefinitely at room temperature (20°C–25°C) until either contaminating microbial growth is seen or precipitation of the constituents occurs. Stock preparations of 10x cell lysis buffer should be stored 4°C, indefinitely until either precipitation or contamination becomes apparent.\nPause point: After the cells have been washed and resuspended in lysis buffer, the screw cap tubes can be directly frozen at -80°C. We have frozen lysates for up to one week, but have not tested the long-term stability past this point. For infectious virus work, this step is preferred as it is a failsafe to ensure that cells are fully lysed prior to removal from the PC3 laboratory for analysis. Allow all tubes to warm to room temperature (20°C–25°C) prior to continuing with the nanoluciferase assay. Pulse vortex prior to distributing thawed samples into the 96-well plate below.\nPrepare Nano-Glo luciferase reagents as per manufacturer’s instructions in the technical guide (Promega).\nCalculate the number of assays that need to be performed and prepare reagent with 5–10% excess to accommodate pipetting error.\nTransfer 25 μL of each lysed sample to a 96-well plate suitable for luminescence reading for the plate reader.\nTo each sample well pipette 25 μL Nano-Glo reagent.\nPipette to mix and then allow to stand at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for at least 3 min before reading the plate in the plate reader (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1])."
