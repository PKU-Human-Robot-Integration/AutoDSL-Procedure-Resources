    "1. Comparison of the Uptake of mTHPC in the Respective Low and Highly Metastatic HOS and 143B OS Cell Lines\nPrepare cell culture medium containing DMEM, Ham F12, and heat inactivated fetal calf serum in a ratio 4.5:4.5:1.\nNote: The liposomal formulation of the PS mTHPC was dissolved in water at a final concentration of 1.5 mg/ml mTHPC.\nPlate 0.2 x 106 HOS and 143B cells/well in 6-well plates (triplicates for each condition) and let the cells adhere overnight.\nNote: the number has to be adjusted to individual cell lines. A confluency of 80-90% is most suitable at the time of the experiment.\nOn the following day, incubate the cells with a fixed concentration of mTHPC for different time periods (time dependent uptake), or with increasing concentrations of mTHPC during a fixed time period (dose dependent uptake).\nIncubate the cells with mTHPC for specific time points or concentrations of mTHPC.\n\tNote: In this study, both the HOS and 143B cell lines were incubated with 0.6 µg/ml mTHPC for 0, 2.5, 5, or 10 hr, or with 0, 0.6, 2.5, and 10 µg/ml mTHPC for 5 hr. The applied time periods and dosages may vary depending on the cell line that is used.\nRemember to always work in the dark or in dimmed light conditions to prevent direct light exposure of the cells.\nAfter incubation of the cells at the indicated conditions, aspirate the medium and wash the cells three times with PBS. Next, detach the cells with 0.5 ml trypsin/EDTA and count the cells.\nAfter detachment, centrifuge the cells at 400 x g for 5 min, aspirate the medium and resuspend the cells in PBS to a final density of 200,000 cells/ml.",
    "Pipette 100 µl of the obtained cell suspension (i.e. 20,000 cells) in a 96-well plate and measure the fluorescence of these cells in a fluorescence spectrophotometer . The settings for mTHPC fluorescence measurements are: 417 nm for the excitation and 652 nm for the emission.\nIn order to calculate the amount of internalized mTHPC per cell, normalize the relative fluorescence unit (RFU) for the cell number and cell volume as follows:\nPrepare a standard curve using different concentrations of mTHPC in PBS from 0-4 µg/ml (use triplicate measurements). Pipette 100 µl of each dilution in a 96-well plate and measure the fluorescence of the wells using the settings described under step 1.6.\nDivide the RFU (obtained for 20,000 cells) by the slope of the linear standard curve of mTHPC, which gives the concentration of mTHPC (in µg/ml) in the well.\nDivide this mTHPC concentration by 10 to get the total amount of mTHPC in one well (in µg, representing 100 µl of cell suspension) and divide this value by the volume of 20,000 cells.\nCalculate the volume with the formula for a sphere: (4/3 x π) x r3. Obtain the radius r by measuring the diameter of 20 trypsinized cells under a microscope, and dividing this value by 2.\nFinally, normalize all the values to those obtained for HOS cells after 10 hr of incubation (dose dependent uptake) or treated with 10 µg/ml mTHPC (time dependent uptake), which were set to 100%.\n2. Measurement of Phototoxicity of PS In Vitro\nSeed 3,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate (triplicates for each concentration of mTHPC used) and let them adhere overnight. Similarly prepare an additional 96-well plate and treat the cells as described below, but then put them aside for phase contrast imaging.",
    "Note: the number has to be adjusted for each individual cell line. A confluency of 50-60% at the time of the experiment is ideal.\n\t\nKeep in mind to add the corresponding dark toxicity control of cells for each of the mTHPC concentrations. These are cells that will be incubated in the absence or presence of selected concentrations of mTHPC, but will not be illuminated.\nOn the following day, incubate the cells with different concentrations of mTHPC (0, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.03, 0.075, 0.15, 0.3, 0.6, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 µg/ml) depending on the cell lines and keep them in the dark for 5 hr.\n\t\nRefer to Section 1.3.2\n\t\tNote: The incubation time before illumination depends on the cell line and on the PS used, therefore it is advisable to test different concentrations and different time points in separate experiments.\nFollowing incubation for the indicated time period, wash the cells twice with PBS and add new fresh medium without mTHPC.\nIlluminate the cells with a 652 nm diode laser, specific for the mTHPC absorption spectrum (see Figure 1).\n\t\nSet the laser to 21.88 mW/cm2 power at a height of 13.5 cm distance from the cells, in order to get an energy dose of 5 J/cm2. Illuminate the cells for 230 sec. Do not illuminate the dark toxicity control cells (with and without mTHPC).\nNote: Always wear glasses to protect the eyes from the laser light used for excitation of the PS.\nAfter illumination, keep the cells in the dark at 37 ºC for 24 hr. Subsequently, add water soluble tetrazolium (WST-1) reagent (10 µl/100 µl of medium).\nThree hours after the addition of the WST-1 reagent, measure the absorbance of individual wells of the 96-well plate at 415 nm.",
    "In order to calculate the percentage of surviving cells, set the mean of the values obtained for the non mTHPC treated cells for each condition to 100% (i.e. illuminated, without mTHPC and nonilluminated, without mTHPC).\n3. Estimation of Cell Number by Cell Counting\nSeed 20,000 cells/well in a 24-well plate and let them adhere overnight.\nIncubate the cells for 5 hr with mTHPC (0.001, 0.003, 0.15, 0.6, and 1.25 µg/ml) and illuminate them as described above.\nCollect the medium, wash the cells once with PBS, trypsinize them and collect them by centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min.\nAfter centrifugation, aspirate the medium and resuspend the cells in 200 µl of fresh medium.\nCount the cells in a Neubauer chamber.\nSubscription Required.
