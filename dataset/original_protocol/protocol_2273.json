    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nPEG Incubation\nTiming: 45 min, day 1, 48 h incubation\nThe gold cover glasses are incubated with PEG-SH (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). The thiol groups covalently bonds with gold to form a self-assembled monolayer (SAM), which is protein repellent.\nPrepare a solution of 1 mg/mL PEG-SH in ultrapure water (Solution 1).\nCritical: Store the solution at 4°C.\nNote: The solution remains stable for several months at 4°C and does not have to be freshly prepared before each incubation.\nWash gold coated coverslips in ethanol in an ultrasonic bath (400 W) for 2 min and dry them in a stream of dry nitrogen.\nDo surface pre-treatment to clean gold coated coverslips in an air plasma (100 W) for 40 s.\nIncubate the coverslips with 200 μL of solution 1 at room temperature for 48 h in argon atmosphere.\nCritical: Store the coverslips in argon atmosphere. During incubation, cover slips should not be exposed to large room temperature fluctuations.\nNote: Use a weighing bottle. This can be filled with argon and sealed tightly with parafilm.\nNote: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) tapping measurements were performed to check the change in surface chemistry, which indicates a PEGylation on the surface on the cover glass. This step is useful during development of the protocol. However, it is not critical. Checking the end result using fluorescently labeled protein coating suffices. As shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] both gold and PEG-layered gold form a smooth surface on the cover glass with different surface roughness. Smooth surfaces are ideal for passivation. The distribution of phase values of the PEG surface is broader than the gold, indicating changes in surface chemistry/composition.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/188-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Then clean them in ethanol in an ultrasonic bath (400 W) for 5 min and afterwards dry them in a stream of dry nitrogen.\nClean the photomask by rinsing in isopropanol, water, and ethanol. Then dry the photomask in a stream of dry nitrogen.\nClean the photomask in air plasma (100 W) for 40 s.\nPlace the mask on a paper tissue on the laboratory bench so that the chrome side is facing upwards. As an adhesion layer between the chromium side of the mask and the pegylated coverslips use ultrapure water (MilliQ). Pipette 5 μL onto the mask (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). Turn your cover glass so that the non-pegylated side is facing up and the pegylated side is in contact with the water (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/188-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Scheme of UV Exposure\n(A) The distance of 0.5 cm between mask with cover glasses and UV lamp is adjusted by a lifting platform.\n(B) The gold side of the coverslips is placed on the water drop.\n(C) The mask is turned upside down. The chromium side with the coverslips points down and is placed on a lifting platform. With this platform the distance of 0.5 cm to the UV lamp is regulated.",
    "Note: Before exposure, make sure that there are no air bubbles between coverslip and photomask. For this, it is best to use the back of a plastic pipette tip (100–1,000 μL volume) to carefully press the cover glass to the mask. Apply pressure with pipette tip carefully and directly onto the cover slips. Be careful that they do not break and the mask is not damaged. Otherwise, even exposure is not guaranteed, and the patterns will show defects.\nTurn the mask over so that the side of the mask with the coverslips is facing down on the lifting platform. A distance of 0.5 cm has proven to be effective for producing accurate patterns. With lifting platform the distance between mask and UV lamp can easily be adjusted (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). The mask with the cover glasses can now be exposed.\nNote: The even exposure depends on the intensity distribution of the used UV lamp.\nIrradiate the coverslips with UV light for 5 min at an energy dose density of the lamp is 70 mW/cm2. The irradiation time need to be optimized for different lamps and intensity distributions.\nNote: It is essential that the step is carried out in a fume cupboard or in a flow. The deep UV light produces ozone during the reaction. Due to the UV radiation it is important to wear protective goggles and not to expose your skin during the reaction and to make sure that no people enter the laboratory.\nRinse the mask carefully with water and remove the cover glasses.\nNote: Using the back of a plastic pipette tip (100–1,000 μL volume) while rinsing with water, the cover slips can be carefully pushed off the mask to avoid scratches.",
    "Clean the irradiated coverslips in a mixture of acetone, ethanol, and ultrapure water (1:1:1) in an ultrasonic bath for 1 min. Afterwards dry them in a stream of dry nitrogen.\nPause Point: Before incubating with protein, the cover slips can be stored for several weeks.\nNote: It is recommended to store the cover slips in a weighing bottle filled with argon and sealed with parafilm. The cover slips are placed vertically in the Wash-N-Dry rack in the weighing bottle, so that no agglomerates can develop on the surface. A thin layer of PDMS has been poured into the weighing bottle to prevent the holder from slipping. (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) The rack can be used to assign numbers to the individual samples, so that it is possible to determine which sample will be used later.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/188-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Coverslips Stored in a Rack in a Weighing Bottle with PDMS on Bottom and Filled with Argon\nThe PDMS prevents the holder from slipping. A storage for several weeks is possible, cause the coverslips are stored vertically and it is more difficult for agglomerates to adhere.",
    "Note: In order to achieve a reliable transfer of the micropatterned array from the mask to the PEG-SH layer, the UV exposure time was adjusted stepwise. Different exposure times were tested and the transferred oxidized patterns were examined in the AFM for their shape and size. The quality of transfer was determined by the comparison between the single patterns in the mask and in the PEG-SH layer. AFM images of the three different patterns in the mask (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A–7C) show the expected size of the whole patterns and a linewidth of approximately 5 μm (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]G). After 5 min exposure the PEG-SH layer shows the successful transfer of the patterns (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D–7F). The exposure left an around 1 nm deep oxidized pattern in the layer (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]H). The AFM images confirm the highly accurate, high-fidelity transfer of the patterns onto PEG-SH with virtually unchanged linewidth. In contrast, an oxidized pattern with a too long exposure time of 6 min (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]I) is larger than the mask pattern and appears less sharp. This can also be seen in the cross-section (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]J). In the AFM height image, agglomerates and additional layers can also be seen, because at this time of protocol development no washing step with rack for vertical storage of the cover glass was performed after the PEG incubation and before the UV exposure. The measurement with the AFM is not critical. It was used to develop the protocol and to demonstrate the fidelity of the pattern transfer.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/188-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

Cells can later attach to this extracellular matrix protein using the RGD motif.\nPrepare a sterile solution of 1 mg/mL fibronectin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (solution 2).\nMixing solution 2 with Cy3 as described in the Cy3 Amersham Mono-Reactive Dye Pack yields solution 3.\nCritical: The dye Cy3 is only used to check the pattern transfer of the photomask (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]A) to the protein pattern of the PEG layer (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B) in the fluorescence microscope. If the cells are stained later, this Cy3 staining may be counterproductive and overlapping spectra must be avoided. The fibronectin solution without the dye is also diluted to a concentration of 10 μg/mL like in step 16. Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]C and 8D shows inadequate fibronectin-Cy3 patterns. The patterns are arranged in an incomplete array. They are blurred, wider than desired, and additional fibronectin is visible on the surface.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/188-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8.

    "Note: Protect the dye from light with aluminum foil and switch off the light or darken the room.\nRinse the pegylated coverslips in ethanol in the biosafety cabinet to get them sterile.\nDilute solution 3 to 10 μg/mL in PBS (solution 4).\nPipette 500 μL of solution 4 on top and incubate for 2 h.\nNote: Protect the coverslip from light with aluminum foil and switch off the light or darken the room.\nWash carefully three times with PBS after 2 h.\nCell Culture and Seeding\nTiming: 24 h, day 3\nThe protein micropattern were incubated with 3T3 mice fibroblasts, which adhered to the pattern and change their shape due to the underlying pattern shape (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nNote: All values refer to a T25 cell culture flask.\nCheck the general health state of the 3T3 cell line with the microscope. Aspirate the old medium.\nWash gently with 5 mL PBS and aspirate it.\nDetach your cells with 0.5 mL 0.25% trypsin and store them for 3 min in an incubator 5% CO2 37°C.\nTap gently against the cell culture flask and look under the microscope to see if the cells have detached.\nStop the reaction with 4.5 mL medium and suspend well to obtain evenly distributed single cells.\nDetermine the cell count.\nSeed the cells in 3 mL medium per coverslip and petri dish. For 3T3, a total of 60 000 cells has proven to be a good value.\nKeep the cells incubated for 8–10 h in an incubator 5% CO2 37°C.\nFluorescence Staining of Cells on Pattern\nTiming: 24 h, day 4 + 5\nTo observe, analyze, and evaluate the effect of the shape on the cytoskeleton of the cell, the cells were fixed, and actin fibers were stained.\nNote: All values refer to a T25 cell culture flask.",
    "Look at the cells after 8 h in the microscope and judge whether you have single cells and notice changes in shape.\nCritical: If that worked, follow protocol. If you notice that you have single cells that have not adhered enough, incubate longer. Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9] shows seeded 3T3 mice fibroblasts on fibronectin cross micropatterns adhere to the pattern which leads to separated single cells. They adjust their cell shape accordingly to the underlying pattern. If you have a confluent cell layer, start the protocol at the beginning with PEG incubation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/188-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Optical Image of 3T3 Mice Fibroblasts Adhering to the Fibronectin Cross Micropattern\nScale bar, 50 μm.\nSafety Warning: 16% formaldehyde is toxic and harmful to health. Working in a fume cupboard is necessary.\nPrepare a solution of 4% formaldehydes in PBS.\nNote: Always prepare the formaldehyde solution fresh. It can polymerize with oxygen.\nRemove the medium and carefully wash your cells with PBS.\nNote: It is very important to wash carefully at this step and do not pipette directly onto the cover glass. The cells can adhere less to the protein patterns and are not as relaxed as on a normal protein layer. If not washed carefully enough, the cells may be detached.\nIncubate the coverslips for 10 min with 2 mL 4% formaldehyde.\nWash 3 times with PBS.\nPrepare a solution of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS.",
    "Note: Triton X-100 must be pipetted very slowly and very carefully. It is highly viscous. It is best to use reverse pipetting. Do not cut off the tip of the pipette, this will change the volume. After pipetting in PBS, it is vortexed for a few minutes. A strong foaming will occur. Make sure that a homogeneous solution has formed in the falcon by holding it against the light. If not vortex further.\nIncubate the cover glasses for permeabilization with 2 mL of the 0.5% Triton X-100 solution for 10 min. Do not be surprised about the foam.\nWash 3 times with PBS.\nIncubate the coverslips for at least 30 min with 2 mL solution of 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in MilliQ water.\nRemove the BSA. Pipette 2 mL of Alexa 568 phalloidin diluted in PBS (1:100) into the petri dish.\nNote: Depending on the research interest, other cell components may be of interest, for which another dye can be used.\nIncubate 10 h at 4°C. Then remove the dye and wash three times with PBS.\nNote: The fluorophore must be protected against light.\nStore the slide with the cells upwards in a petri dish in PBS for imaging. Additional mounting depends on the application."
