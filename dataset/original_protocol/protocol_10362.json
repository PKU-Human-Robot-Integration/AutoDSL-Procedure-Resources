    "1. MFP Head and Platform Cleaning and Preparation\nNOTE: This protocol uses vertically-oriented silicon-glass hybrid MFP heads15,16. The silicon component of the head contains the microchannels, which are etched to a depth of 100 µm. The etched silicon is bonded to glass using anodic bonding. The channel design comprises a pattern consisting of six channels, two each for injection and aspiration, and two for injecting the immersion liquid (Figure 1). The channels used for injecting immersion liquid replenish the media surrounding the biological sample, thus avoiding losses due to aspiration and evaporation. The inner channels and outer channels used in the current work are 100 × 100 µm and 200 × 100 µm respectively. Post fabrication and processing, MFP heads with clear channels and polished apexes are obtained.\nPreparation of the pumping station and fluid-handling apparatus\nUse capillaries with a 1/16'' (1.59 mm) outer diameter and 0.02'' (0.51 mm) inner diameter for all tubings connected to the syringes. Vary capillary size based on application and obtain the appropriate connectors and fittings to interface the MFP head with the syringes. Use ultrapure water wherever dilutions are necessary.\nClean syringes (250 - 500 µl volume) and syringe plungers by sonication in 0.5% bleach solution in ultrapure water prior to- and post- live cell experiments. Rinse them thoroughly with water. Fill them with water by immersing their tips completely in a water bath and aspirating using the plunger. Purge the liquid while within the water bath with the syringe shaft contacting the seal at the exit of the syringe. Repeat aspirate and purge until no air bubbles are seen in the syringe columns.",
    "Connect filled syringes to the syringe pumps using Luer-lock connectors. Use a switch valve mounted on the pumps to direct the liquid from the syringe to one of two capillaries leading either to the MFP head or to the liquid reservoirs (Figure 6). (If no switch valve is available see section 1.4.4). Purge both capillaries with water from the syringes at a flow rate of about 10 - 50 µl/min, depending on the size of the syringe until about 10 µl of water is left in the syringes.\nPre-insert the purged capillaries into an appropriate microfluidic connector/adaptor which interfaces with the channel vias in the head (e.g., M1 connector — see materials).\nMFP head preparation\nClean the MFP head by sonication using glassware detergent for standard cleaning or 0.5% bleach for stringent cleaning, for 5 min. Purge channels with water by immersing the apex in water and applying vacuum to the vias.\nInspect channels under a stereomicroscope for potential obstructions (clogging) and repeat the previous step if necessary.\nMount the clean head on the head holder and screw the connector with the pre-inserted and purged tubing onto the head. Screw the head holder to the Z-stage, which is used for the control of gap distance between the head and the cell monolayer.\nCalibrating the scanning stages of the MFP platform\nPerform endpoint calibration of the X-, Y- and Z-stages prior to connecting the head to the platform, according to manufacturer's protocol with an appropriate software interface. Calibrated stages ensure accuracy in positioning the MFP head.",
    "Obtain a crude zero gap distance (zeroing) by bringing the MFP head over a chamber slide without cells and slowly descend in 5 µm steps. Upon probe contact with the substrate, Newton's rings should be observed. This is a crude estimate. An accurate position is to be obtained after adjusting coplanarity of the probe apex to the substrate.\nTo ensure coplanarity of the probe apex, adjust the tilt of the head using a goniometer (at the interface of the head and the Z stage). When formed ensure that the Newton's rings are symmetric (Figure 1). Move the MFP head 20 µm away from the substrate and adjust tilt using the goniometer. Repeat descend, zeroing and tilt adjustment until the Newton's rings are symmetric on contact. With tilt adjusted, set the z position which produces symmetric Newton rings as zero.\n\t\tNOTE: The Z-stage controls the head-to-substrate distance, whereas the X-Y stage controls the scanning of the substrate (Figure 2). A detailed explanation can be found in our earlier work14.\nChemical preparations for local removal of cell layers\nCaution: Where appropriate, use safety equipment (e.g., nitrile gloves, safety glasses) for the chemicals being prepared. Use a fume hood if necessary for preparing solutions. Prepare all chemicals and buffers with ultrapure water as the diluent.\n\t\nPrepare 50 mM NaOH solution as the processing liquid for the inner injection channel (i2 with flow QI2 in Figure 1).\nPrepare the extraction buffer solution required for the outer injection (i1 with flow QI1 in Figure 1), composed of 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 0.5% Tween 20, and 10 µM rhodamine B in 50 mM Tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane at pH 8. For purging, use water in the aspiration syringes.",
    "Filter all solutions using a 0.2 µm syringe filter. Degas all filtered solutions using a desiccator until the dissolved air stop bubbling to the surface.\nUsing the drain line connected to the syringe pumps, purge the remnant water and aspirate the degassed solutions into the injection syringes at 40 µl/min until the syringes are full (250 or 500 µl). This ensures bubble-free filling of the syringes, connectors, and capillaries. The syringe–switch valve–two-capillary system allows filling of the syringes mid-experiment. In the absence of such a switch valve, disconnect the capillaries from the head and fill the capillaries and the syringe by aspirating the degassed solutions before reconnecting them to the head.\nAspirating the processing and shielding liquids through the capillaries allows for the use of small volumes during operation. If the chemicals can be prepared in large volumes, fill syringes with the required solutions directly. For example, the aspiration syringes that contain water can be filled using this approach.\nPurge the capillaries to the MFP head with the liquids allocated for each channel as defined in 1.4.1 and 1.4.2.\n\t\tNOTE: The extraction buffer solution shields the NaOH in the inner confinement and the rhodamine component in the buffer facilitates the visualization of the hHFC during operation.\nIf the cells are over-confluent, with cell aggregates appearing on the cultured surface, supplement the extraction buffer with 10% Proteinase K. This supplements the action of NaOH on these aggregates by dissolving denatured proteins as the lysate enters the aspiration channels. This prevents clogging of the channels during operation.\nPreparation of cell monolayers on chamber slides\nCaution: Use a cell culture hood for culturing the cells and handle equipment as per regulations set by the biosafety officer of the laboratory. Note special requirements of specific cell lines and adapt protocol and equipment accordingly.",
    "Use cell culture incubators (at 5% CO2 and at 37 ºC) for culture and expansion of cells to be patterned. Perform the expansion using standard cell culture protocols17,18 in T flasks. Use culturing media as per requirements of the specific cell line (e.g., serum and antibiotic supplemented DMEM for culturing MCF7 and MDAMB 231).\nOn reaching cell confluence in the culture flasks, trypsinize and collect cells and seed 2×105 cells/cm2 in each of the 2-chamber slides for patterning and culture over 48 hr. Use the cells in one of the chambers as a control for cell growth and viability.\nOn reaching cell confluence on the chamber slides, incubate the cells for 45 min with 500 µl cell-tracker dye solution (e.g., green - CMFDA or orange - CMRA) at 10 µM concentration prepared in serum-free medium. This is done for cell visualization during patterning. Wash the labelled cells with PBS by gently flushing each chamber using a pipette, and subsequently culture the cells in serum-supplemented media for the patterning experiments.\nObtain a reference image of the cell-tracker-stained cell surface for the purpose of cell counting. This is done to ensure confluency of the cell layer. In addition, it serves as an aid for quantification experiments if sample recovery and DNA analysis are objectives.\n\t\tNOTE: In case that cell viability is to be assessed during patterning, the cells can be stained with a Live/Dead cytotoxicity kit in accordance to the manufacturer's instructions.\n2. Creating the Hierarchical Hydrodynamic Flow Confinement (hHFC)\nMove the MFP over the cell monolayer to a gap distance of 50 µm from the glass slide. This gap distance while ensuring contact of the hHFC also accounts for monolayer surface and thickness variation.",
    "Inject NaOH at 6 or 8 µl/min through i2. Evaluate other flow rates (i.e., QI1, QA1 and QA2) using the flow rules in Figure 3.\nModulate the size of the inner HFC by changing the ratio of QI2/QI1 using the injection syringes. For example, use a QI1 between 1.3 µl/min and 4 µl/min, with the QI2 fixed at 8 µl/min, which results in a NaOH footprint of 150 - 300 cells (100 - 200 µm2/cell) (Figure 3D).\nInject complete medium from the outer-most apertures on the MFP head at a flow rate of 20 µl/min to account for evaporation of the media and aspiration during the operation of the hHFC.\n3. Patterning Cell Monolayers Using hHFC\nNote: The scanning pattern determines the areas of the cell monolayer where the cells are extracted (subtractive patterning), leaving the remaining cells to study specific biological questions. This pattern can be straight lines or an array of spots, for example. Complex patterns require design of a suitable scanning trajectory. For example, a checkered scanning trajectory provides a grid of cell areas (shown for example in Figure 4A), which would enable studying the effect of different stimuli on cells in different squares while being in close proximity. These patterns can be created using control over the X-Y stages of the platform, where the control software allows scripting of scan trajectories for the MFP head over the cell monolayer.\nSet the stage software to scan the probe head over the cell monolayer in user-defined patterns (by setting X, Y and Z coordinates) at a scan velocity of 10 µm/s at a gap distance of 50 µm.\nWith the nested hHFC in operation and in contact with the monolayer, scan the MFP with a trajectory of the desired pattern to effect patterned cell removal.",
    "For a co-culture after the first cell type removal, seed a different cell line to fill the gaps, using methods described in section 1.5. Move between nested and pinched modes (by increasing gap distance, for example) to control cell removal.\n\tNOTE: The scan velocity may have to be investigated for other cell lines. The scan velocity used in this demonstration effects complete cell removal over the scanned regions for the used cell lines.\n4. Downstream Processing for Sampling and DNA Amplification\nPrepare the sampling station for downstream analysis of the lysate. For the sampling station, use a 3D printed 8-strip PCR tube holder. Alternatively, choose an appropriate tube holder to serve as this adaptor, which is capable of being mounted within the scanning range of the head outside the substrate. Wipe the tube holder with 70% ethanol or other surface decontaminants based on the stringency desired for the application. Use a magnetic clip on the tube holder to attach it onto the substrate holder.\nAfter preparing the sampling station, position the MFP head 100 µm from the monolayer. Begin operating the hHFC with 50 mM NaOH solution as the processing liquid for the inner injection channel with flow rates of 1, 6, -7 and -17.5 µl/min for QI1, QI2, QA1 and QA2 respectively.\n\t\nOnce the flow confinement has stabilized (in approximately 10 sec), descend the probe head to a gap distance of 50 µm to perform NaOH based local lysis of the chosen sub-population of cells with the hHFC. Once lysis of the sub-population is complete (approximately 30 sec per footprint), direct the head towards the tubes in the sampling station. Eject the collected lysate into the PCR tubes directly (Figure 6).",
    "For downstream processing of the lysate, first neutralize the pH of the solution by mixing the lysate with Tris buffer (1:1). After neutralization, heat the lysate to 95 ºC for 30 min. Then directly load the lysate into a standard qPCR workflow as set by supplier of the instrument."
