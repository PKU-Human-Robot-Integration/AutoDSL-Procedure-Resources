    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nSeeding Cells (Day 0)\nTiming: approximately 30 min\nThis step describes how to seed the medium- or heavy-labeled IGR37 or IGR39 melanoma cell line.\nRemove and discard culture medium from the pre-cultured IGR37 or IGR39 melanoma cells in 15 cm dish.\nWash attached cells with 10 mL of autoclaved phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for three times to remove serum (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nAdd 1.0 mL of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA solution, incubate at 37°C for 3–5 min and observe cells under an inverted microscope. If required, extend the incubation time until all the cells detach from the plastic dish.\nAdd 9.0 mL of complete medium- or heavy-labeled growth medium and aspirate cells by gently pipetting.\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL conical centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 250 × g for 5 min at 25°C (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nRemove and discard culture medium and suspend the cell pellet in 1.0 mL complete medium- or heavy-labeled growth medium and check the cell number using a cell counter.\nSeed 1 × 106 cells in 10 mL complete medium- or heavy-labeled growth medium into one 15 cm dish.\nNote: generally, by seeding 1 × 106 cells more than 2 × 106 cells are collected at day 2. If not, seed more than one plate for each sample.\nNote: depending on the cell type, 1 × 106 cells may look sparse, in this case seed at least at 50% confluency.\nCells Starvation in Serum-free Medium (Day 1)\nTiming: 30 min\nThis step describes how to eliminate serum proteins from the medium.\nRemove and discard the culture medium.\nWash the attached cells with 10 mL of autoclaved PBS for three times.",
    "Wash the attached cells with 10 mL of medium- or heavy-labeled growth medium deprived of fetal bovine serum (FBS) for three times.\nAdd 10 mL of medium- or heavy-labeled growth medium FBS deprived, starve the cells for 18 h.\nSecretome Preparation (Day 2)\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step describes how to prepare the secreted proteins extract.\nCollect the medium from 2 × 106 cells previously starved in serum-free medium for 18 h. Centrifuge at 250 × g for 5 min to eliminate dead cells. Filter the supernatant with 0.22 μm filters.\nMix the heavy and medium secretomes 1:1. Concentrate the secreted proteins by using microcon filters with 10 kDa cutoff (Millipore) (capacity 15 mL) until 500 μL. Centrifuge at 4,500 × g for 10 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/325-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Concentration and Buffer Exchange of Secreted Proteins\n(A) Concentration of the cell culture medium. The solution in the lower part of the Falcon tube is discarded, while secreted proteins, present in the upper part, are concentrated to 500 μL.\n(B) Further concentration of the secretome. The solution at the bottom of the tube is discarded, while secreted proteins, present in the upper part of the filter and indicated by the arrow, are concentrated to 30 μL.\nNote: if the volume of the combined secretomes exceeds the microcon capacity, load the sample in steps of 15 mL each until the entire volume is loaded on the filter.",
    "Denature proteins by changing the buffer with urea 8 M Tris-HCl 100 mM at pH 8 (urea buffer) as follows. Add urea buffer on the top of the microcon filter, centrifuge at 9,300 × g for 10 min and discard the flow through. Perform at least three washes with 5 mL of urea buffer or until the solution become transparent. Transfer the secreted protein extract (generally about 500 μL) into an Eppendorf tube and sonicate with BIORUPTOR (3 cycles: 30 s on/30 s off).\nNote: the sonication step is important to destroy proteins aggregates and to release proteins from extracellular vesicles allowing proteins to be properly solubilized.\nQuantify proteins concentration by using Bradford assay. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nNote: in our experiments, 2 × 106 cells produce more than 30 μg of secreted proteins. This amount is sufficient for the MS analysis.\nPause Point: The secreted protein extract can be stored at −80°C for at least several weeks.\nSecretome De-glycosylation and Proteolytic Digestion (Day 2)\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step describes how to reduce and alkylate cysteines of secreted proteins and how to perform proteins de-glycosylation and double digestion.",
    "By using smaller (about 400 μL capacity) microcon filters with 10 kDa cutoff (Millipore), reduce the volume of 30 μg of secreted proteins to 30 μL. Add the secreted proteins on the top of the filter (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Centrifuge 10 min at 9,300 × g at 25°C. Discard the flow through. As the secretome will be more than 400 μL, load the secreted proteins in steps of 400 μL each until the entire sample is loaded. Leave the proteins on the filter and perform cysteines reduction and alkylation adding TCEP 10 mM and 2-Chloroacetamide 40 mM in urea buffer on the top of the filter and incubate for 30 min at 25°C. Specifically, add 200 μL of urea buffer to the filter plus 8 μL of 2-Chloroacetamide 1 M and 2 μL of TCEP 1 M. After 30 min, centrifuge 10 min at 9,300 × g at 25°C. Discard the flow through.\nExchange buffer by centrifugation at 9,300 × g for 10 min with 200 μL of buffer G (dilution buffer provided with the enzyme) and add 1.5 μL PNGase F (500 units/μl) for 1 h in 100 μL of buffer G at 25°C following manufacturer’s instruction.\nExchange again buffer by centrifugation at 9,300 × g for 10 min with 300 μL ammonium bicarbonate 50 mM for two times and digest with trypsin (1:50 = enzyme: secreted proteins) dissolved in 100 μL ammonium bicarbonate 50 mM for 12–18 h at 37°C.\nPeptides are recovered at the bottom of the microcon filters by centrifugation at 9,300 × g for 10 min and by adding two consecutive washes of 50 μL of NaCl 0.5 M.",
    "Exchange again buffer by centrifugation at 9,300 × g for 10 min with 300 μL phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) for two times and add Glu-C (1:50 = enzyme: secreted proteins) dissolved in 100 μL of phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) on the top of the filters to further digest polypeptides.\nPeptides are recovered at the bottom of the microcon filters by centrifugation at 9,300 × g for 10 min.\nNote: trypsin- and Glu-C-digested peptides are analyzed separately at the MS and pooled together in MaxQuant analysis.\nPeptides Purification and LC-MS/MS (Day 4)\nTiming: 2 days or more (depending on the number of samples to be analyzed)\nThis step describes how to purify peptides and LC-MS/MS analysis.\nEluted peptides are purified on a C18 StageTip (Rappsilber et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). 3 μg of digested sample are injected onto a quadrupole Orbitrap Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific).\nPause Point: The peptide samples can be stored at −20°C for a few weeks.\nPeptides separation is achieved on a linear gradient from 95% solvent A (2% ACN, 0.1% formic acid) to 55% solvent B (80% ACN, 0.1% formic acid) over 75 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) and from 55% to 100% solvent B in 3 min at a constant flow rate of 0.25 μL/min on UHPLC Easy-nLC 1000 (Thermo Scientific) where the LC system is connected to a 23-cm fused-silica emitter of 75 μm inner diameter (New Objective, Inc. Woburn, MA, USA), packed in-house with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 μm beads (Dr Maisch Gmbh, Ammerbuch, Germany) using a high-pressure bomb loader (Proxeon, Odense, Denmark).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/325-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. TIC (Upper Panel) and Base Peak Chromatogram (Lower Panel) of a Typical Secretome MS Analysis",
    "The mass spectrometer is operated in DDA mode: dynamic exclusion enabled (exclusion duration = 15 s), MS1 resolution = 70,000, MS1 automatic gain control target = 3 × 106, MS1 maximum fill time = 60 ms, MS2 resolution = 17,500, MS2 automatic gain control target = 1 × 105, MS2 maximum fill time = 60 ms, and MS2 normalized collision energy = 25. For each cycle, one full MS1 scan range = 300–1,650 m/z (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), was followed by 12 MS2 scans using an isolation window of 2.0 m/z.\nMS analysis is performed as reported in Matafora et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]. Raw MS files are processed with MaxQuant software, making use of the Andromeda search engine (Cox et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). MS/MS peak lists are searched against the UniProtKB complete proteome database depending on the samples origin. Searches are performed on both trypsin- and Glu-C-digested peptides analyzed together for each sample by selecting, as fixed modification, alkylation of cysteine by carbamidomethylation, while, as variable modifications, oxidation of methionine, N-terminal acetylation, and N-Deamination. For R and K amino acids, multiplicity is set to 2 and modifications including medium- heavy-labeled R and K are considered. Trypsin and Glu-C specificity are used with up to two missed cleavages allowed. Mass tolerance is set to 5 ppm and 10 ppm for parent and fragment ions, respectively. Andromeda generates a reverse decoy database used to calculate the False Discovery Rate (FDR), which is set to <0.01 for peptide spectrum matches (PSMs). For identification, a minimum of two peptides identified per protein is required, of which at least one has to be unique to the protein group. The minimum ratio count used for quantification is 2 (Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: LC-MS/MS parameters and post data analysis may vary depending on the instruments and software available in each laboratory."
