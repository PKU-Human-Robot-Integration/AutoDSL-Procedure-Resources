    "All procedures described in this protocol have been performed in accordance with guidelines and regulations for the use of vertebrate animals, including prior approval by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Passivation of windows\nNOTE: Passivation of stainless steel cleans the metal of contaminants and creates a thin oxide layer that greatly increases the metal's biocompatibility with soft tissues, even beyond that of titanium16.\nStart the passivation process by washing the optical window frames with a 1% (w/v) enzymatically-active detergent solution.\nSubmerge the frames in a 5% (w/v) sodium hydroxide solution at 70 °C for 30 min inside a glass jar.\nTake out the frames and rinse them with deionized water.\nImmerse the frames in a 7% (w/v) citric acid solution at 55 °C for 10 min inside a new glass jar.\nRemove the frames and rinse them with deionized water again.\nRepeat step 1.2, and finally, rinse the window frames with deionized water one last time.\n2. Preparation for tumor implantation or window surgery\nNOTE: For studies of pancreatic tumors, tumor cells must be implanted and allowed to grow into overt tumors. To visualize the tumor cells in vivo, it is recommended to use cells that have been genetically altered to express fluorescent proteins such as Dendra2. Using fluorescent protein labels that are bright will mitigate potential issues with tissue autofluorescence. Other potential fluorescent proteins, dyes, and genetically encoded fluorescent mouse models that may be used have been discussed elsewhere17,18. To prevent contamination of the operative field, perform the surgical procedure in a hood or laminar flow cabinet and ensure that distinct areas are used for preparation, surgery, and recovery.",
    "Prior to the surgery, sterilize all surgical instruments in an autoclave and, if necessary, use a hot bead sterilizer for subsequent procedures. Ensure that the surgery employs a tips-only technique.\nSwitch on the heated surgical pad and bead sterilizer and wait for it to reach the appropriate operating temperature. The heating pad temperature should be monitored with a surface thermometer to avoid potential burns. Place a sterile cloth over the heating pad if the temperature cannot be adequately controlled.\n\tNOTE: Body temperature during short procedures (≤20 min), such as tumor and window implantation, is minimally affected while using a heated surgical pad. However, longer periods of anesthesia, such as during extended timelapse imaging, require the mouse to be placed in a heated chamber to maintain body temperature.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 5% isoflurane in an anesthesia chamber.\nCritical Step: Lower the anesthesia to 2% once the mouse is unconscious. Carefully monitor the anesthesia level and the mouse's vitals (e.g., using a pulse oximeter)19.\nPlace a small drop of eye lubricant on each eye of the mouse to prevent corneal drying.\nPrior to surgery, apply depilatory cream generously to the left upper abdomen to remove hair. After 20 s, use moistened tissue paper to firmly wipe away the hair and depilatory cream. Repeat the process as needed until all hair is removed from the surgical area.\nInject 10 µL of buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) diluted in 90 µL of PBS subcutaneously to ensure preoperative analgesia.\n3. Pancreas tumor implantation",
    "Prepare aliquots of tumor cells at the desired concentration (based on tumor cell doubling time). Place the cell suspension in an insulin syringe and keep it on ice. To follow this protocol, use 106 syngeneic KPC tumor cells20 suspended in a maximum of 50 µL of PBS, following the orthotopic injection protocol adapted from Erstad et al.21\n\tNOTE: This cell line injected at this concentration routinely produced palpable or appropriately large tumors by 10-14 days. Subclones of this cell line and other pancreatic cell lines would need to be evaluated for appropriate concentrations and timelines to produce appropriately sized tumors).\nWash hands using antiseptic soap.\nPrior to each new surgery, put on new sterile gloves.\nTransfer the mouse to the sterile surgical hood and place it in a partial right lateral decubitus position.\nSecure the limbs with paper tape.\n\tNOTE: Proper use of the instruments is important throughout the procedure. Examples of how to hold forceps, Castroviejo scissors, and the vacuum pickup tool are shown in Figure 2A-C.\nSterilize the abdomen with antiseptic (Figure 2D).\nEnsure the animal is fully anesthetized by performing a toe pinch test.\nMake a 10-15 mm left subcostal incision in the skin using forceps and Castroviejo scissors (Figure 2E).\nControl hemostasis using cotton swabs or a cautery pen when/where deemed necessary.\nCarefully divide the underlying muscle with forceps and Castroviejo scissors to enter the peritoneum (Figure 2F).\nUsing sterile cotton swabs, atraumatically externalize the pancreas and spleen.\nSplay the pancreas out so there are no folds (Figure 2G).\nIdentify the desired tumor injection site in the body or tail of the pancreas (away from blood vessels).",
    "Critical step: After careful positioning of the pancreas, use forceps to provide tension to the tissue and insert the insulin syringe tip, with the bevel facing upwards, into the desired site of the pancreas to a depth of 4-5 mm (Figure 2H).\nSlowly inject the tumor cell solution. Look for a small bubble that confirms a successful injection (Figure 2I).\nCarefully return the pancreas to the abdomen without disturbing the tumor cell injection bubble (Figure 2J).\nUsing absorbable 5-0 polydioxanone sutures, close the muscle layer first and then the skin with interrupted sutures (Figure 2K-N).\nCover the incision with cyanoacrylate glue (Figure 2O), then return the mouse to a clean cage under a heating lamp for recovery. Administer antibiotics in drinking water to prevent infection. Monitor the mice and allow them to completely recover from surgery.\n\tNOTE: Antibiotics are administered as required by IACUC protocol. All animals are housed individually.\nAllow the tumor to develop for 10-14 days until it is palpable through the abdominal wall.\n4. Pancreas window surgery\nWhen the animals are ready for imaging, begin the window implantation surgery. To begin, wash hands with antiseptic soap.\nBefore every new surgery, put on fresh sterile gloves.\nOn the heated surgical stand, place the mouse in the right lateral decubitus position to expose the left abdomen.\nAnchor the mouse's front and hind limbs to the heated surgical stage cranially and caudally using paper tape. Ensure the spleen (beneath the skin) is visible within the surgical field (Figure 3A).\nTo maintain sterility, unpackage all surgical instruments in the hood.\nDisinfect the surgical site by swabbing the mouse's skin with a generous application of antiseptic.\nEnsure the animal is fully anesthetized by performing a toe pinch test.",
    "Critical step: Lift the skin of the left upper quadrant of the abdomen with forceps and make a ~10 mm circular incision in the skin and musculature using Castroviejo scissors (Figure 3B,C).\nControl the bleeding and maintain hemostasis using cotton swabs or the cautery pen, where needed.\nLocalize the pancreas, which is attached to the spleen, and identify the direction the pancreas is laying within the incision to decide where the supporting cross-stitch should be placed.\nUsing 5-0 silk suture, place the first stitch at the desired location in the muscle layer. Tie this end with 3-5 knots. (Figure 3D,E)\nContinue to stitch directly across the incision. Cut and leave a tail of ~5 cm (Figure 3F).\nRepeat steps 4.11 and 4.12 perpendicular to the first stitch (Figure 3G,H).\nCritical step: Gently lift and position the pancreas over the cross-stitch (Figure 3I,J). Take care not to damage the pancreas during manipulation.\nCritical step: Using the 5-0 silk suture, perform a purse-string stitch ~1 mm from the hole, circumferentially, interlacing the skin and muscle layer (Figure 3K).\nPosition the window frame so the edges of the circular incision are seated within the window's groove (Figure 3L).\nFasten the implanted window by firmly tying down the 5-0 silk.\nLoad 100 µL of liquid cyanoacrylate adhesive into the 1 mL syringe.\nDry the tissue by applying a delicate flow of compressed air for ~10 s.\nClasp the window frame by its outer edge with forceps and gently raise it to ensure separation of the pancreas from the undersurface of the window frame.\nCritical step: Dispense a thin layer of liquid cyanoacrylate adhesive along the recess of the window (Figure 3M). Be sure not to get any of the adhesive on the pancreas tissue.\nUsing vacuum pickups, lift the 5 mm coverslip.",
    "Carefully place the coverslip inside the recess in the center of the optical window frame. Hold with light pressure, allowing the cyanoacrylate adhesive to set (~25 s).\nSeparate the coverslip from the vacuum pickups using forceps.\nTighten the cross-stitch sutures to secure the pancreas snugly to the coverslip (Figure 3N,O). Note: Do not overtighten the cross-stitch as it can cause damage and ischemia to the pancreas.\nCut the ends of the suture.\nStrip off the tape from the mouse.\nSwitch off the isoflurane vaporizer.\nRelocate the mouse to a clean cage or directly to the intravital microscope.\nHouse the animals individually following window surgery and monitor them until full recovery.\nImaging is then carried out on a two-laser multiphoton microscope as we have previously described 22,23,24 For long imaging sessions the mouse is placed in a heated chamber to maintain body temperature and provided with supporting fluids as per IACUC standards.\n5. Cerulein treatment for the induction of pancreatitis\nTo investigate the onset of pancreatitis, treat healthy mice with cerulein after implantation of the SWIP. Ensure that the mice are fasted for 14-18 h and given ad libitum water before cerulein administration.\nInject 50 µg/kg of cerulein in 100 µL of sterile 1x DPBS intraperitoneally at 1 h intervals for up to eight injections. Administer an equivalent volume of 1x DPBS alone, injected intraperitoneally, to the control mice.\nFollowing imaging, sacrifice the mice 24 h after the first injection by cervical dislocation as per IACUC standards.\nPerform imaging on a two-laser multiphoton microscope as previously described22,23,24. For long imaging sessions, place the mouse in a heated chamber to maintain the body temperature and provide it with supporting fluids as per IACUC standards.\nSubscription Required.
