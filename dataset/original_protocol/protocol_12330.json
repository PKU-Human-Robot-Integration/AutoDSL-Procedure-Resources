    "NOTE: All animal procedures in this protocol are conducted with the approval of University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and are in compliance with the 'Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals'.\n1. Basic Experimental Set up Before Intermittent Hypoxia Administration\nExpose pups12 to the different gas mixes using a whole-body mouse plethysmograph chambers in much the same manner as adult rodents for other experimental purposes5,13,14. The chambers have a 4 inch diameter (volume = 450 ml), which is of ample size to accommodate 3-4 mouse pups or 1-2 rat pups. Here, AIH protocols are delivered to neonates aged postnatal day 1-8 (P1-P8).\nUse compressed air gas tanks to deliver the 21% “baseline” gas, which maintains chamber oxygenation at 21%. To achieve “relative hypoxia”, use a 10% oxygen/90% nitrogen gas tank.\n\tNOTE: Plastic tubing (3/16” diameter) connects the gas tanks to a flow meter. Thus, the input to the flow meter consists of one tube each for baseline and hypoxia airflow.\nConfigure the gas tubing as follows.\n\t\nRun plastic tubing (1/8” diameter) from the flow meter to a bias flow regulator, which enables flows of 1 L/min to each chamber (i.e., 4 L/min if 4 chambers are used).\nRun plastic tubing (1/8” diameter) from the bias flow regulator to the plethysmography chambers. Airflow at 1 L/min to each chamber is a predetermined flow rate at which gas exchange is deemed to be non-stress-inducing to the animals based on physiological and behavioral observations.\nSeal all unused connections to and from the bias flow unit and all unused openings to the chambers with caps so that no gas flow escapes to other chambers not in use, or out of the plethysmography chambers during the protocol.",
    "Place the chamber(s) into an incubator prior to putting animals in the chamber to allow equilibration to 37 °C, or body temperature.\n2. Calibration of Cycle Times for Intermittent Hypoxia\nInspect all tubing, between air tanks and flow meter, flow meter and bias flow unit, and bias flow unit and plethysmography chamber(s) for proper connections. The connections are set up as described in Step 1. Verify the connection by a step-wise check of all described lines and closures: e.g., checking unused lines out of the bias flow unit and any chamber openings not in use.\nConnect an ambient O2 sensor with a hand-held O2 meter and then attach the sensor to the plethysmography chamber lid.\nOpen both gas tanks and attach one pair of surgical, long handled hemostats insulated with plastic tubing to clamp the off-cycle flow of gas. In this way, only one gas tank at a time is delivering the 1 L/min gas flow per chamber. Clamp the “baseline” gas mix while the “hypoxic” gas mix is delivered to the chamber, and vice versa.\nRecord the time required for the chamber O2 to reach the target levels of 10% and return to 21%. Utilize the recorded times for subsequent protocol delivery.\n3. Administration of Acute Intermittent Hypoxia\nInspect all tubing and connections as described in Step 2.1.\nPlace neonates in the plethysmography chamber(s) and house the plethysmography chamber lids into the chamber base. Confirm a proper seal to the O-ring seal is as well as closure of any unused chamber connections. These steps are critical to ensuring the appropriate delivery of gas mixes.",
    "Place the chambers holding the pups to be treated into the 37 °C incubator and close the door. Allow chamber to equilibrate to 37 °C prior to starting the protocol. Maintain control animals at 37 °C in the incubator at room air oxygenation.\nOpen both gas tanks and use one pair of surgical, long handled hemostats insulated with plastic tubing to clamp the off-cycle flow of gas. In this way, only one gas tank at a time is delivering the 1 L/min gas flow per chamber.\nUse a hand-held timer to precisely time cycles and to indicate the time to switch the hemostats between tubes, thus resulting in the alternation of gas flow to the chambers.\nRecord the completion of each cycle using a treatment log such as the one provided in Figure 1 to mark off all steps in the 2-step, 20 cycle protocol.\nMonitor the incubator temperature at every cycle change to ensure animals are maintained at the designated range (33-35 °C, which is the setting on the incubator that results in 37 °C).\nClosely monitor pup activity throughout the protocol to ensure that animals tolerate cycles without visible distress such as vocalizations, altered level of limb activity or rolling.\n4. Isolation and Culture of Stem/Progenitor Cells from the Subventricular Zone\nNOTE: The change in neurosphere formation following AIH compared to controls is an example of an endpoint that demonstrates the efficacy of this protocol to elicit tissue- and cellular-level changes.\nTo isolate neurospheres forming cells, remove mouse or rat pups from the chamber immediately after AIH is completed. Sacrifice the animals according to IACUC protocols within 30 min of protocol termination.",
    "Harvest the SVZ tissue, place into neurosphere culture and conduct standard passage and expansion of derivative neurospheres, as previously published in methods chapters15,16 and a separate video protocol8.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
