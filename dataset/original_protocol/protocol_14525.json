  "procedures": [
    "Procedures involving postmortem human tissues have been reviewed by the institutional review board and exempted under 45 CFR (Code of Federal Regulations).\nNOTE: The protocol describes a symmetric bihemispheric brain cutting procedure for postmortem brain assessment finalized for neuropathological studies in humans. Detailed descriptions of the apparatuses, instruments, materials, and supplies necessary to perform human brain cutting will be excluded. Materials and supplies for brain dissections are selected at the discretion of the single investigator and are based on autopsy tools allowed or approved at each research institution. The minimal set of tools and material required for this procedure is described in the Material/Equipment Table. Specific cutting procedures and precautions for suspected transmissible brain diseases, such as human CJD, are outside the aims of this manuscript and are available from other sources7.\n1. Symmetric Bihemispheric Brain Cutting\nNote: Ensure that the brain has received the necessary tissue fixation (using, for example, neutral-buffered 10% formalin) for a period of two to three weeks, depending on the periagonal, metabolic (i.e., pH), and tissue preservation (i.e., temperature) conditions. However, for imaging-pathology correlation studies, a longer period of fixation (>5.4 weeks) has been suggested8.\nPlace the brain on a flat surface facing the investigator, with the frontal poles directed in the opposite direction with respect to the investigator.\nPlace the brain in such a way as to allowing a full and clear visualization of all cortical gyri and sulci of the entire cerebrum (Figure 1a).\nFirst look for meningeal anomalies, macroscopic hemispheric asymmetries (possible indicators of focal, lobar, or generalized hemispheric phenomena of atrophy), macroscopic tissutal lesions (i.e., tumors or herniation), congenital malformations, vessel abnormalities, and any other possible abnormalities or unusual presentations of the cerebral surface.",
    "​NOTE: For detailed descriptions on how to assess a human brain, refer to commercially available neuropathology textbooks and autopsy manuals9,10.\n2. Protocol Sequence\nFace frontal poles away from the investigator, with the superficial aspects of the hemispheres (telencephalon) facing the investigator. Take as many digital pictures as necessary in each particular case to document possible macro-anomalies and to account for possible clinico-neuroanatomical and post-cutting considerations. Have a research assistant take digital photographs perpendicularly to the brain to capture the entire cortical surface (Figure 1a - c).\nMark pre and postcentral cortical gyri using ink or colored needles before cutting the brain (Figure 1b).\n\tNOTE: This procedure facilitates a more immediate recognition of the motor and somatosensory primary cortices after cutting.\nRotate the brain by 180 degrees while keeping it facing the same direction (i.e., the frontal poles facing away from the investigator). Carefully inspect the base of the brain. Pay special attention to the conditions of cerebrovascular systems (i.e., basilar and vertebral arteries and the circle of Willis) and cranial nerves at their brainstem exit/entrance levels. Manage the olfactory bulbs and tracts with special care to avoid tissutal laceration, due to their extreme frailty.\n\t\nTake as many digital pictures as necessary in each particular case to document possible macro-anomalies and to account for possible clinico-neuroanatomical and post-cutting considerations. Have a research assistant take digital photographs perpendicularly to the brain to capture the entirety of the cortical and brainstem surfaces.",
    "Facing the base of the brain and using a scalpel, cut the brainstem transversally at the level of the upper portion of the pons (as close as possible to the base of cerebrum). Carefully inspect the SN (i.e., for pallor)11 and other neighboring structures12. Take note, possibly using an audio recorder device, of any unusual appearance of the brain in comparison to a normal brain13.\nAgain rotate the brain by 180 degrees and, using a sharp knife, separate the two hemispheres by cutting the corpus callosum centrally through the medial longitudinal fissure and following a fronto-occipital direction. Inspect each side of each hemisphere for possible anomalies (e.g., ventricular enlargements, malformations, tissue softening, tumors, etc.)13. See Figure 2a.\n\t\nTake as many digital pictures as necessary in each particular case to document possible macro-anomalies and to account for possible clinico-neuroanatomical and post-cutting considerations. Have a research assistant take digital photographs perpendicularly to the brain to capture the entire cortical surface. Take note of any unusual feature of the brain in comparison to a normal brain.\nPlace the two hemispheres flat, lying on their medial aspects, with the frontal lobes facing away from the investigator, as shown in Figure 2b. Place them in such a way that their centers touch (also in case of marked hemispheric asymmetry).\nUsing a sharp knife, manually cut through both cerebral hemispheres, starting at the frontal poles and moving towards the occipital poles through the entire length of the hemispheres. Obtain two series of 1 cm thick blocks of brain tissue (around 18 slabs for each hemisphere).",
    "Place the brain slabs in an anatomically organized (fronto-occipital direction) sequence on a separate flat surface. Use a white surface with a ruler printed on it for better contrast when photographing. Display the two series of cerebral slabs in an anatomically symmetric way (fronto-occipital direction), making sure that their coronal surfaces are visible for direct eye inspection and digital photography (Figure 3a). Use cutting surfaces with printed millimetric grids on both sides to localize brain structures, sizes, and possible abnormalities in a more accurate manner.\n\t\nTake as many digital pictures as necessary in each particular case to document possible macro-anomalies and to account for possible clinico-neuroanatomical and post-cutting considerations. Have a research assistant take digital photographs perpendicularly to the brain to capture the entire cortical surface. Take notes (possibly using an audio recorder device), of any unusual aspect of the brain in comparison to a normal brain.\nUsing a sharp scalpel, manually dissect smaller rectangular blocks of brain tissue for each established cerebral region. Follow the proposed cerebral region collection scheme described in Table 1.\n\t\nPut each tissue block in separately labeled histocassettes.\n\t\t​NOTE: Each block of brain tissue needs to be cut to fit, as much as possible, the standard histocassette maximal volume (30 x 20 x 4 mm3).",
    "Label the histocassettes using a de-identifying code for each case and using specific neuroanatomical identifiers (do not use random letters or numbers for different brains; rather, always use the same regional anatomical names or corresponding numbers, as shown in Table 1). Create de-identifying codes, for example, by generating random or semi-random numbers for each case (i.e., BRC 130, where B stays for Brain, R stays for Resource, C stays for Center and 130 is a progressive accession or AD160001, where AD stands for \"Alzheimer's disease study,\" 16 is the year when the autopsy was performed (2016), and 0001 a progressive accession specimen number).\n\t\t​NOTE: This step is very helpful for future researchers; keep a legend, and specify the hemisphere (L = left hemisphere, R = right hemisphere). Use two different colors of histocassettes, establishing a specific color for each hemisphere.\nTake as many digital pictures as necessary in each particular case to document possible macroanomalies and to account for possible clinico-neuroanatomical and post-cutting considerations. Have a research assistant take digital photographs perpendicularly to the brain to capture the entire cortical surface. Take note of any unusual feature of the brain in comparison to a normal brain.\nTake digital pictures (as many as necessary or desired) of the entire cut brain and the associated histocassettes.\nPunch (e.g., by Accu-punch) small pieces of tissue for DNA extraction and genetic analyses. Use a punch of 2 - 5 mm in diameter.\n\tNOTE: For its high content of genomic material, the cerebellum is the preferred choice; however, any other region is fine.\nRe-immerse all histocassettes containing brain tissue blocks in the same type of fixative solution (e.g., 10% neutral-buffered formalin) as previously used until the next step of tissue processing.\nFollow standard procedures for human formalin-fixed tissue processing14.",
    "3. A Special Approach: Alternating Frozen and Fixed Symmetric Bihemispheric Cutting\nNOTE: The symmetric bihemispheric brain cutting protocol described in section 2 offers the possibility of cutting tissue slabs from unfixed, fresh brains (when available) in the same systematic and symmetric manner.\nPlace the entire fresh brain upside down (preferably on a semispherical bowl-like plastic surface) for 8 - 10 min in a -80 °C freezer to harden the brain tissue without provoking biochemical damage and to facilitate the manual cutting.\nUsing a sharp knife, cut both hemispheres in an alternate and consecutive manner, following the brain cutting protocol described in Section 2, but freeze and fix every other slab (from both hemispheres and along a fronto-occipital anatomical direction).\n\t\nAt this point, do not try to cut each cerebral region, as described in Table 1. Cut specific fresh brain regions only if required for immediate RNA or protein extraction (i.e., for genomic or proteomic studies)15.\nAfter cutting, immediately freeze, label, and number each fresh tissue. Take digital pictures of the entire slab series; pack each slab in a single plastic bag; collect the slabs in a separate, one-brain-only container; and store the container in a dedicated -80 °C freezer.\n\t​NOTE: The freezer should be dedicated to human brain tissue only. Only later will single frozen brain regions be cut as required for each specific experiment.\nImmerse every other tissue slab chosen for fixation (10% neutral-buffered formalin or another fixative) in separate bags containing a sufficient volume of fixative (3/1 volume of fixative/tissue-block ratio). Label each bag by consecutively numbering them following a fronto-occipital sequence. Seal each bag, take digital pictures, and store them in a plastic container.\nOpen the fixative-containing bags after 2 weeks of tissue fixation and cut each cerebral region as described in Table 1.",
    "4. Histostain and Immunohistochemistry\nNOTE: The set of cerebral regions cut based on the proposed scheme (Table 1) are sufficient to satisfy most, if not all, currently established consensus-based pathological criteria for AD16, PD17, Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB)18, Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD/MND)19, Progressive Suprabulbar Palsy (PSP)20, Multiple System Atrophy (MSA)21, Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE)22, etc.\nFor each brain region and for both hemispheres, perform the following minimum set of histostains: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), cresyl violet (CV; if quantitative morphometric studies are planned, for example), and silver staining (if \"exploratory\" analyses are needed).\nFor each brain region and for both hemispheres, perform the following minimum set of immunohistochemistry protocols: β-amyloid (βA), phosphorylated-Tau (pTau), phosphorylated α-synuclein (pα-syn), and phosphorylated-TDP43 (pTDP43), as described14.\n\tNOTE: The total number of tissue sections in order to assess each brain following this protocol is 46 (if all cerebral regions from both hemispheres are available).\nSubscription Required.
