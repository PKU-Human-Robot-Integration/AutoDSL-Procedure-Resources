    "1. Preparation of protoplasts from M. oryzae\nPrepare the oatmeal-tomato agar (OTA).\n\t\nWeigh 30-50 g of oatmeal and boil it in 800 mL of water (ddH2O) for 20 min. Filter through two layers of gauze and take the filtrate.\nPick ripe tomatoes and peel them. Squeeze the juice, and filter through two layers of gauze to collect 150 mL of the filtered juice.\nMix all the tomato juice and the prepared oat filtrate thoroughly and add ddH2O up to 1000 mL.\nAdd 250 mL of the OTA and 2.5 g of agar powder to a 500 mL conical flask, and autoclave for 20 min. Store at 25 °C.\nPour 25 mL of the autoclaved OTA into a glass 5 cm x 5 cm Petri dish. Prepare 10 of these Petri dishes total. After the OTA has solidified on the Petri dishes, store the dishes upside down at 25 °C.\nUse a sterilized toothpick to dig out a small piece of mycelium from M. oryzae (the wild-type strain P131, knockout strains Δmobre2, Δmospp1, and Δmoswd2) and place them on the prepared OTA dishes. Culture them for 4-6 days at 28 °C under light conditions.\n\tNOTE: Turn the Petri dish upside down to prevent pollution.\nAdd 1000 µL of liquid Complete Medium (CM) (0.6% yeast extract, 0.3% enzymatic casein hydrolysate, 0.3% acidic casein hydrolysate, 1% glucose) to the OTA dishes using a 1000 µL pipette.\n\tNOTE: The hyphae grew on the OTA dishes for 4-6 days.\nScrape the mycelia of the wild-type strain and knockout strain with an inoculation loop.\nCollect the mycelia debris and transfer them to 250 mL of liquid Complete Medium (CM).\nGrow the fungal debris in a triangular flask at 28 °C for 36 h with shaking at 150 rpm.",
    "Use a funnel to filter and collect the fungal hyphae.\nWash the fungal hyphae with 500 mL of 0.7 M NaCl solution.\nCollect the fungal mycelium and weigh it.\n\tNOTE: The mycelium does not need to be dried before weighing.\nAdd ~1 mL of lysis enzyme permeation solution per 1 g of the fungal mycelium.\n\t\nPrepare the 20 mg/mL lysis enzyme permeation solution by dissolving the lysis enzyme from Trichoderma harzianum in 0.7 M NaCl.\nPlace the hyphae for lysing at 28 °C for 3-4 h with shaking at 150 rpm.\nWash the lysed hyphae with 50 mL of 0.7 M NaCl solution.\nCollect the protoplasts and centrifuge for 15 min at 2,000 x g and 4 °C.\nAfter centrifugation, discard the supernatant carefully.

    "Perform sonication (25% W, output 3 s, stop 5 s, 4 °C) immediately with a sonicator for about 10 min. The purpose of this step is to sonicate the cross-linked lysate for a period of time to determine the best conditions.\n\tNOTE: The lysate can be frozen at -80 °C at this step.\nIf optimal conditions for sonication have already been determined, proceed to the next step.\nIf desired, remove 5 µL of protoplasts for agarose gel analysis (unsheared DNA).\nShear the chromatin by sonication with an ultrasonic homogenizer for 8 min (25% W, output 3 s, stop 5 s, 4 °C).\nAfter the sample is ultrasonically broken, take out a part of the sample as \"input\".. The input does not perform the ChIP experiment and contains all DNA and protein released after the sample is sonicated.\nAfter sonication, run a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis to analyze the length of the DNA fragments.\n\tNOTE: The agarose gel electrophoresis results show that the length of the DNA fragment is 200-500 bp (Figure 4).\nPlace the sonicated tube on ice to prevent protein degradation.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 10,000 x g and 4 °C.\nAfter centrifugation, transfer the centrifuged supernatant to a new 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and store it at -80 °C for later use. The chromatin solution obtained in this step can be used for subsequent IP.\nBefore performing the IP experiment, dilute each chromatin sample to a ratio of 1:10 with 1x RIPA buffer (e.g., add 10 µL of chromatin sample to 1 µL of 1×RIPA buffer).\n3.

The incubation time depends on different factors (e.g., the antibody, gene target, cell type, etc.) and will need to be empirically tested.\n4. Collecting and rinsing the IP products\nPellet the superparamagnetic protein beads by placing them on a magnetic stand.
