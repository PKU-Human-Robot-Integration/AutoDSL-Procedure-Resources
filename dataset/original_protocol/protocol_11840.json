    "The procedures for working with zebrafish breeding adults and embryos described in this protocol were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Murray State University.\n1. Embryo Collection and Fixation\nPrepare spawning tanks by placing adult zebrafish mixed sex pairs or groups in tanks with a mesh or slotted liner filled with system water overnight.\nAt lights on, change the spawning tank water for fresh system water to remove feces. Use a 14 h/10 h light dark cycle with lights coming on at 9 am.\nOnce eggs are laid, return the adults to home tanks.\nCollect eggs by drawing them up using a transfer pipet or pouring them into a mesh strainer.\nTransfer the eggs to Petri dishes filled halfway with embryo medium (such as 30% Danieau or E2 embryo medium with 0.5 mg/L methylene blue), limiting the number of embryos per dish to 50.\nRemove any eggs that are dead or fail to divide.\n\tNOTE: Dead embryos can be easily identified as they become opaque and often appear \"cloudy\". If methylene blue is added to embryo medium, the dead embryos take on a dark blue appearance.\nIncubate dishes of eggs at 28.5 °C until they reach the desired stage. For this experiment, raise the embryos until 23 hpf.\nOptional) Transfer the embryos at 24 hpf to 200 µM 1-phenyl 2-thiourea (PTU) in embryo medium to prevent melanogenesis16,17. Alternatively, bleach embryos post-fixation (see optional section 5).\nChange embryo medium or PTU medium daily.\nDechorionate unhatched embryos using ultra-fine-tip forceps under a stereomicroscope. Alternatively, chemically dechorionate embryos by incubating in 1 mg/mL Pronase in embryo medium for several minutes at room temperature. Remove the embryos from Pronase and wash three times with embryo medium.",
    "Dechorionated embryos will stick to plastic. Keep them in glass or plastic Petri dishes coated with 1-2% agarose dissolved in embryo medium. Move dechorionated embryos using fire-polished Pasteur pipets to minimize damage.\nTransfer the embryos to 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes using a plastic or fire-polished pipet.\nRemove embryo medium with a micropipette. Leave only enough liquid to just cover the embryos after each fluid change.\nPrepare 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a chemical fume hood.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is a hazardous material. Wear gloves and dispose of contaminated liquids and solids in designated areas.\nFix the embryos in 4% PFA for 1-2 h with gentle rocking at room temperature. Alternatively, fix the embryos 4 h to overnight at 4 °C.\nWash three times in 1x PBS + 1% Triton-X (PBTriton) for 5 min.\nUse the embryos immediately or store at 4 °C for up to 1 week.\nFor long term storage, dehydrate the embryos in 100% methanol (MeOH) 2 h or overnight at -20 °C. Store the embryos at -20 °C in MeOH for several months.\n\tCAUTION: MeOH is a hazardous material. Wear gloves and dispose of contaminated liquids and solids in designated areas.\n2. Embryo Preparation\nRehydrate the embryos through serial incubations at room temperature.\n\t\nIncubate in 75% MeOH/25% 1x PBS for 5 min, rocking.\nIncubate in 50% MeOH/50% 1x PBS for 5 min, rocking.\nIncubate in 25% MeOH/75% 1x PBS for 5 min, rocking.\nIncubate in 100% PBTriton for 5 min, rocking.\n(Optional) Prepare a fresh proteinase K working solution (10 µg/mL in PBTriton) on ice by adding 10 µL of freshly thawed proteinase K stock (10 mg/mL).\n\t\nPermeabilize the embryos by digesting up to 30 min in Proteinase K.",
    "NOTE: Suggested timing is <24 hpf: no digestion; 24 hpf: 15 min digestion; and 7 days old: 30 min digestion.\nRinse permeabilized embryos in PBTriton and re-fix in 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature.\nWash the embryos three times in PBTriton for 5 min at room temperature with gentle rocking.\n3. Primary Antibody Incubation\nSelect a commercial blocking solution or serum matching the secondary antibody host species (ex. 10% goat serum in PBTriton) with or without 2 mg/mL Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA).\nBlock the embryos in blocking solution for 1-3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C while rocking.\nIncubate in primary antibody diluted in blocking solution or 1% serum in PBTriton overnight at 4 °C while rocking. In this experiment, the primary antibodies used were anti-NMDAR1, anti-pan-AMPA receptor, and anti-phospho-Histone H3, each diluted to a final concentration of 1:500 in 1% goat serum in PBTriton.\nWash five times in PBTriton for 10 min at room temperature while rocking.\n4. Secondary Antibody Incubation\nSelect a secondary antibody based on the host species of the primary antibody and the desired wavelength.\nIncubate in secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution or 1% serum for 2 h at room temperature (or overnight at 4 °C) while rocking.\n\tNOTE: Fluorescent secondary antibodies are light sensitive. We used 1:500 goat-anti-mouse Alexa488 diluted in 1% goat serum in PBTriton.\nCover the tubes with aluminum foil or cover with a light-blocking box for this and all subsequent steps.\nWash three times in PBTriton for 10 min at room temperature while rocking.\nTransfer the embryos to a 50% glycerol solution in PBS over a bed of 2% agarose in embryo medium and proceed to documentation or proceed to further processing steps below.\nOptional Steps\n5. Bleaching",
    "Prepare bleach solution in a 1.5 mL tube by adding 810.7 µL of ddH2O, 89.3 µL of 2 M KOH, and 100 µL of 30% H2O2.\nInvert the tube three times to mix.\nPipette 1 mL of bleach solution direction to the embryos.\nOpen the embryo tube cap to allow gas to escape. Gently tap the tube on the bench to dislodge bubbles.\nMonitor the bleaching process (use a microscope if necessary) and stop the reaction when pigment is sufficiently removed (approximately 5 min for 24 hpf or 10 min for 72 hpf).\nCarefully remove the bleaching solution with a micropipette and rinse embryos three times in 1 mL of PBTriton.\n\tNOTE: Embryos are sticky in this step.\nProceed to documentation or further processing steps below.\n6. Embryo Dissection and Deyolking\nTo remove the yolk, transfer a small amount (~200 µL or enough to completely cover the embryo but restrictive enough to limit where it can float) of 1x PBS to a depression slide or a plain glass slide.\nUse a plastic transfer pipet to move 1 or more embryos to the PBS droplet.\nUse ultra-fine forceps and 00 insect pins to break apart the yolk and very gently scrape yolk granules from the ventral surface of the embryo (see also Cheng et al., 2014)18.\nRemove yolk granules and replenish PBS as needed.\nRepeat until embryo is sufficiently free of yolk.\n7. Flat Mounting on Slides\nTransfer deyolked embryos to a charged glass slide with a plastic pipette or a 1 mL micropipette with a trimmed tip (to reduce shear stress). Orient as desired with a 200 µL micropipette tip or insect pin.\nWick away excess PBS with a Kim wipe or paper towel.\nAdd 2-3 drops of mounting media to the slide and coverslip.",
    "Air dry for approximately 5 to 10 min.\nSeal the cover glass onto the slide with clear nail polish.\n\tNOTE: The edges of the cover glass must be completely covered with a thin, continuous layer of nail polish.\nAllow to dry approximately 10 min before imaging.\n8. Mounting in Agarose\nPrepare 1% agarose in embryo medium by adding 0.5 g of agarose to 50 mL of embryo medium in a microwave-safe flask or beaker of at least 3x greater volume than desired.\nHeat in a microwave, swirling every 30 s, until agarose is completely dissolved.\nMake 1 mL aliquots in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. Store the aliquots at room temperature.\nCover tube caps with cap locks before heating.\nPlace agarose tubes in a floating tube holder in a beaker half-filled with water.\nMicrowave the beaker with floating tubes for 2-3 min, or until agarose is completely melted.\nTransfer an embryo to the bridged slide with a plastic pipette or a 200 µL micropipette with a trimmed tip (to reduce shear stress).\nPosition the embryo on a rectangular coverslip using insect pins and add approximately 20 µL melted agarose directly to the embryo.\nQuickly orient the region of interest closest to the coverslip using 00 insect pins.\n\tNOTE: This is an upside-down mount.\nReturn the agarose tube to the hot water tube float between each use and microwave as needed.\nImage using a microscope when the agarose hardens. Keep the mounted embryo upside-down for use on an inverted microscope. Flip the coverslip over (so the agarose is under the coverslip) for use on upright microscopes.\n9. Mounting on Bridged Slides\nTo make bridged slides, glue square coverslips to the glass slide using a small dot of superglue.",
    "NOTE: There should be a trough at least 5 mm wide between the coverslips. Two #1 coverslips high is typically appropriate for 24-48 hpf embryos while three coverslips high may be necessary for 72 hpf.\nTransfer 1-2 deyolked embryos to the bridged slide with a plastic pipette or a 200 µL micropipette with a trimmed tip (to reduce shear stress).\nWick away excess fluid with a Kim wipe or paper towel.\nAdd a drop of ≥80% glycerol directly to the embryo.\nCover with a rectangular cover glass. The droplet of glycerol should touch the cover glass.\nAdd more glycerol to the space between the cover glass and slide as needed to completely cover the embryo with a margin of glycerol on the sides of the embryo.\nSlide the rectangular cover glass gently to roll the embryo into position for imaging.\n10. DAB Staining\nNOTE: This section begins after step 4.2 above and replaces the rest of step 4.\nIncubate the embryos in a blocking solution with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C while rocking.\nWash three times in PBTriton for 10 min at room temperature.\nTransfer the embryos to a culture plate or depression slide with a transfer pipette.\nMix 50 µL of 1% DAB (3,3'-diaminobenzidine) dissolved in ddH2O and 50 µL of 0.3% hydrogen peroxide and bring to 1 mL with PBS.\n\tCAUTION: DAB is a hazardous material. Wear gloves and dispose of DAB contaminated liquids and solids in designated areas.\nCover HRP-stained embryos with the DAB solution prepared above and monitor for color development (typically 1-5 min) under a microscope.\nAfter reaching the desired level of color development, rinse the embryos briefly in PBS.\nTransfer the embryos back to a 1.5 mL tube before fixation.",
    "Re-fix the embryos for 15-20 min in 4% PFA at room temperature.\nWash the embryos three times in PBTriton for 5 min.\nProceed to documentation.\n11. Modified Protocol for Staining Sectioned Tissue That is Mounted on Slides\nEncircle tissue to be stained with a pap pen.\nTransfer the slides to a humid chamber.\nAdd 1 mL ofPBS directly to the slide.\nIncubate 7 min at room temperature to remove embedding medium.\nPour off PBS by inverting slide.\nRehydrate 1 min in up to 1 mL of TNT buffer (100 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween20).\nBlock in up to 1 mL of blocking solution (commercial or 10% serum + 2% BSA) for 1 h at room temperature.\nIncubate overnight in primary antibody diluted in 1% serum or blocking solution at 4 °C.\nWash five times in up to 1 mL of TNT buffer at room temperature.\nIncubate in secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Cover the chamber with foil or use a dark lid.\nWash five times in TNT at room temperature. Pour off last wash.\nMount with 2-3 drops of mounting medium and coverslip. Let sit 5-10 min.\nSeal the cover glass onto the slide using clear nail polish. Allow to dry completely before imaging.\n12. Documentation\nRecord the full procedure and any deviations in a lab notebook.\nRecord the concentration, name, catalog number, manufacturer, and lot number of the primary antibody.\nPlace appropriately mounted sample on the microscope stage. Locate the region of interest.\nSelect a relatively bright example. Set camera exposure and gain so that signal is sufficiently bright without saturating.\nCompare staining intensity of the same region of interest using the same exposure settings when comparing between experimental antibody-labeled embryos and control antibody (ex. IgG) embryos.",
