    "Outcross TurboID-dGBP lines with GFP-tagged lines of interest (e.g., zebrafish lines expressing GFP-labelled proteins or regions of interest)Set up zebrafish pairs in mating tanks. It is preferable to use males from the TurboID-dGBP line and females from the GFP-tagged lines for protein extraction from embryos younger than 3 dpf (see Nots 1).Collect embryos the next morning and incubate them in the embryo medium at 28.5°C.Sort embryos at 3 dpf according to fluorescent marker expression under a fluorescence microscope. The transgenic fish lines are normally maintained as heterozygote carrying a single copy of the transgene. Therefore, an outcross will produce offspring with all four genotypes: WT embryos with no fluorescent marker, POI-GFP embryos with GFP fluorescent marker, TurboID-dGBP embryos with mKate2 fluorescent marker, POI-GFP and TurboID-dGBP co-expressing embryos with both GFP, and mKate2 fluorescent markers (Figure 1). For protein extraction from 3 dpf embryos or younger, sort the embryos after biotin incubation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4178/bioprotoc-11-19-4178-g001.jpgFigure 1. Representative embryos (3 dpf) from outcrossing the mKate2-P2A-TurboID-dGBP with Cavin4a-Clover line. The transgenic fish lines are maintained as heterozygotes carrying a single copy of the transgene. Therefore, the crossing produces four combinations of genotypes indicated by corresponding fluorescent markers. Scale bar = 1 mm.In vivo biotinylationPrepare fresh biotin-supplemented embryo medium by diluting biotin stock solution into embryo medium to reach a concentration of 500 μM biotin.Incubate sorted embryos (~350 each group) in ~ 25 ml biotin-supplemented embryo medium in a 10 cm Petri dish at 28.5°C for 18 h.Remove unincorporated biotin by three changes of fresh embryo medium (20 min each change) after the biotin incubation. Added ~1 ml tricaine to the medium to anesthetise embryos before changing the medium.Check the biotin labelling in the embryos by immunostaining with NeutrAvidin-DyLight 405 and immunofluorescence imaging (see next section).",
    "Examining in vivo biotinylation by NeutrAvidin immunostainingNote: This should be performed prior to streptavidin affinity pulldown and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. A trial experiment of NeutrAvidin immunostaining with a small number of embryos is recommended before conducting a large-scale pulldown. Sample three embryos for each group after in vivo biotinylation step and anaesthetise them in 500 ml ice-cold tricaine solution in a 24 well plate for 20 min.Replace the tricaine solution with 500 μl of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) by carefully pipetting, and fix the embryos overnight at 4°C.After fixation, wash embryos 3 times with PBS and permeabilise the embryos with 300 µl of 10 µg/ml proteinase K (10 min for embryos at 2 dpf; 15 min for embryos at 3 dpf; or 20 min for embryos at 4 dpf). Fix embryos again with 4% PFA for 15 min.Wash embryos twice in 1 ml of 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS by gently swirling on a shaker for 5 min.Transfer embryos into embryo blocking solution (see Recipes) for 3 h at room temperature.Note: Embryos can be kept in blocking solution overnight at 4°C. Stain the embryos with NeutrAvidin-DyLight 405 (1:500 dilution in blocking solution) overnight at 4°C followed by four washes with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS, 30 min each wash on a shaker. For nuclear staining (if required), stain embryos with DAPI (see Recipes) for 10 min followed by 3 washes with PBS 0.3% Triton X-100, 20 min each wash on a shaker.Mount embryos on a slide with coverslip; alternatively, the embryos can be imaged directly with a water dipping lens. Fluorophore DyLight 405 can be visualised using a blue filter on a fluorescent microscope or use laser 405 nm for excitation and detect emission between 415-460 nm on a confocal microscope.",
    "Note: Embryos co-expressing mKate2-P2A-TurboID-dGBP and GFP-POI should show a clear colocalization of NeutrAvidin and GFP signals, whereas embryos carrying only one of the transgenes should give no or minimum NeutrAvidin staining. An example is provided in Figure 2.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4178/bioprotoc-11-19-4178-g002.jpgFigure 2. Representative confocal images showing TurboID-catalysed biotinylation in zebrafish embryos. Embryos were obtained from outcrossing the TurboID-dGBP line with a Caveolin3-EGFP line. They were subjected to overnight biotin incubation at day 4 and fixed at day 5. TurboID-catalysed biotin labelling was visualised by NeutrAvidin-DyLight 405 staining. Strong biotin labelling was observed at the plasma membrane of muscle cells in the embryos co-expressing TurboID-dGBP and Cavoelin3-EGFP. This staining pattern corresponds to the subcellular localisation of membrane protein Caveolin3, and it is absent in the siblings expressing either TurboID-dGBP or Caveolin3-EGFP. The inserts show boxed area in inverted grayscale. Scale bar = 40 µm.Yolk removal (strongly recommended for embryos younger than 5 dpf; otherwise, skip to section E)Anesthetise embryos by adding tricaine solution and incubate on ice. Transfer the embryos into 2 ml Eppendorf tubes.Replace the medium with ice-cold deyolking solution and disrupt yolk sac by pipetting embryos through a 200 μl pipette tip (Figure 3).Pellet the embryos by brief centrifugation and remove supernatant, which contains yolk proteins. Rinse embryos twice with deyolking solution on ice.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4178/bioprotoc-11-19-4178-g003.jpgFigure 3. Representative images showing the 3 dpf embryos before and after deyolking. The disrupted yolk sac was resulted from pipetting through a 200 μl pipette tip.Protein extraction and biotin affinity purificationHomogenise deyolked zebrafish embryos in 1 ml of embryo lysis buffer (with freshly added protease inhibitors) by brief pulse sonication (1s sonication at intensity 5 with 1s interval for 1 min). Add another 1 ml of embryo lysis buffer and vortex for 30 min at 4°C.",
    "Centrifuge the lysates at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to remove insoluble tissue debris.Note: Zebrafish embryo lysates are prone to protein degradation. Add protease inhibitors and keep lysates on ice to minimise protein breakdown. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube and measure the protein concentration using the PierceTM BCA protein assay kit. For each sample, we used 4 mg of crude fish proteins for biotin affinity purification. However, the amount of crude protein required depends on the GFP-POI expression level and tissue types. For low expressing GFP lines or expression in low abundance cell types, a larger amount of crude protein lysates may be required.Pass the fish lysates through a PD-10 desalting column to remove free biotin. This step is important for subsequent streptavidin pulldown because it increases the efficiency of capturing biotinylated proteins by streptavidin-conjugated beads.Prewash Streptavidin-conjugated DynabeadsTM in embryo lysis buffer three times. Add 200 μl of washed Dynabeads into each lysate sample and constantly mix the lysate/beads on a rotor wheel at 4°C overnight.After the incubation, separate the beads from the fish lysates using a magnetic particle concentrator and transfer to a new Eppendorf tube. Wash the beads twice with fish embryo lysis buffer, once with SDS washing buffer, once with urea washing buffer, and twice in embryo lysis buffer again. Note that the magnetic beads tend to clump together after capturing biotinylated proteins. Vortex the beads in the washing buffer to break down the aggregate and ensure a thorough wash.Protein electrophoresis and protein gel staining (skip this step if on-bead digestion is used)To elute captured proteins, incubate beads in 60 μl of 2× Blot LDS sample buffer with 2 mM biotin and 20 mM DTT at 95°C for 10 min. Briefly vortex the beads after the first 5 min of incubation.",
    "Note that the combination of free biotin and excess heat is able to efficiently elute the biotinylated proteins from streptavidin-conjugated beads (Cheah and Yamada, 2017).Load the eluted protein sample to a BoltTM 4-12% Bis-Tris Plus Gel (or similar) and separate the proteins at 100 V for 30 min.Stain the protein gel with InstantBlueTM Coomassie Protein Stain (or Colloidal Coomassie Blue) (Figure 4). Note that the incubation time varies depending on the amount of protein. For maximal detection sensitivity, incubate the gel overnight in the staining solution.Cut the protein gel into slices of 1-2 mm thickness. Avoid any blank gel in an excised gel slice since blank gel will reduce in-gel digestion efficiency. The excised gel slice can be stored in the fridge for one week.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4178/bioprotoc-11-19-4178-g004.jpgFigure 4. Protein gel stained by InstantBlueTM Coomassie Protein Stain.  The left lane contains a streptavidin pulldown from embryos co-expressing TurboID-dGBP and Cavin4b-Clover, while the right lane contains a streptavidin pulldown from control embryos expressing only TurboID-dGBP.Sample preparation for mass spectrometryFor in-gel digestion, destain the gel slices with 500 μl of destaining solution and incubate for 30 min with occasional vortexing.Replace the destaining solution with 200 μl of 100% acetonitrile and leave for 15 min. Replace the acetonitrile again with another 200 μl of 100% acetonitrile for 15-30 min to ensure dehydration of the protein gel. Acetonitrile is removed in preparation for trypsin digestion.Add 200 μl of sequencing grade Trypsin/Lys-C (20 ng/μl in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate pH 8 buffer). Note that the Trypsin/Lys-C solution should cover the gel pieces, and if required, a further 100 μl of Trypsin/Lys-C solution can be added. Incubate the samples at 37°C overnight.Add 200 μl of 5% formic acid/acetonitrile (3:1, vol/vol) to each sample and incubate for 15 min at room temperature in a shaker.",
    "Transfer the supernatant into clean Eppendorf tubes and dry down in a vacuum centrifuge.Add 12 μl of 1.0% (vol/vol) trifluoroacetic acid in H2O to the tube and vortex. Incubate in a sonication bath for 2 min and then centrifuge for 1 min at 6,700 × g. Transfer the solution to an autosampler vial for MS analysis."
