    "The procedures involving animal subjects were approved by the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic Care and Vision Research and the Boston University IACUC protocol (201800302).\n1. Designing the 3D printed holders and cover bar\nDesign the 3D printed holders and cover bar accounting for the average diameter of mouse globes and 3D print the design (Figure 1A, B).\nKeep the diameter of the inner wall of the holder slightly larger than the average diameter of the globe to account for the different sizes of individual mice. Keep the height of the holder at around half of the globe diameter, ensuring a tight fit of the globe when secured by the 3D printed cover bar.\nSize the holder cover bar to the length of the holder's outer diameter with a width that is 1/4 to 1/2 of the holder diameter. The cover bar is sized to allow for access to the globe when secured in the holder for hydration and the removal of the eye at the conclusion of the experiment.\nPrint the holder and cover bar.\n2. Sample collection\nEuthanize mice (male C57BL/6 mice aged 9-12 weeks and 27 weeks old were used for this study) using established protocols in compliance with institutional guidelines. For this protocol, perform euthanasia with carbon dioxide followed by decapitation.\nRemove the mouse head and place it immediately on ice to preserve the viability of the tissue. Enucleate the globes using dissection tools while preventing tissue damage.\nProptose the globe using tweezers. Clip the optic nerve using dissection scissors just below where it is held by the tweezers.\n\tNOTE: For further precautions, perform the following steps in a laminar flow hood.",
    "Incubate the globes in 2 mL of medium in a p35 cell culture dish including a calcium indicator and/or cell membrane stain for 1 h in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator with low light conditions. Ensure the globes are submerged in the staining medium for uniform staining.\n\t\nFor the experiments performed here, use the calcium indicator, Fluo4-AM (1:100)2, and cell membrane counter stain, deep red plasma membrane stain (1:10,000)2, with a final concentration of 1% (v/v) DMSO and 0.1% (w/v) pluronic acid in 2 mL of keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM) with the following growth supplements: 25 µg/mL bovine pituitary extract, 0.02 nM epidermal growth factor, 0.3 mM CaCl2, and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/mL and 100 µg/mL, respectively).\n\t\t​NOTE: The incubation conditions and times are variable depending on the calcium indicator, tissue type, and sample volume. When using pluronic acid, caution is advised as it renders tissue permeable. This protocol calls for 10% pluronic acid. Lower concentrations of pluronic acid have been determined experimentally to be ineffective, and higher concentrations risk damage to the tissue.\n3. Preparation of sample holders\nAdhere the holders to a clean glass-bottom coverslip with glue that has not been used previously. The glue used in this protocol comes from single-use containers to ensure sterility and a new, unopened container is used every time.\nWash the holder in 70% ethanol. Place glue onto the holder and adhere the holder to the glass bottom coverslip. Ensure no glue is within the inner area of the holder as glue can fluoresce, complicating imaging.\nWait until the glue solidifies. Confirm the holder is secure against the coverslip.\n\tNOTE: P35 cell plates with glass-bottom coverslips were used for the experiments presented in this manuscript. Other glass-bottom slides and/or plates can be substituted based on the needs of the experiment.",
    "4. Wounding of the eye globes\nRemove the globes from the staining solution using sterile eye droppers, taking care to prevent tissue damage to the region of interest. Wash the globes for 5 min at room temperature using sterile phosphate-buffered saline to remove excess stain, and place the globes in the medium for transport to the microscope.\nWound the globes using a sterile 25 G needle in the region of interest.\n\t\nUsing a sterile eye dropper, pick up and hold the globe from the back of the eye. This will keep the globe stable, prevent it from rolling, and allow consistent wounds to be made. Using this setup, the optic nerve will be inside the eye dropper nozzle, and the cornea will be facing outward.\nFor a scratch wound, gently move a sterile 25 G needle across the exposed cornea. For a puncture wound, gently press the needle directly into the central cornea. Ensure the wound does not puncture the cornea.\n\t\t​NOTE: Skip this step if a wound response or wounded environment is not required for the experiment. Previous studies have shown that both scratch wounds and puncture wounds to murine corneas made using this method are consistent in both diameter and depth10. Confirmation of the wound dimensions between independent globes was performed using a region of interest analysis.\n5. Sample placement on the holder\nPlace the cornea or limbal region onto the coverslip in the inner area of the holder and stabilize using the 3D printed cover (Figure 1C-H).\nConfirm that the globe is positioned correctly and that the site of interest is in contact with the glass coverslip. Once the globe has been placed into the holder, do not try to remove the globe as this may cause tissue damage.",
    "Adhere the 3D printed cover to the holder using glue, ensuring stabilization. Ensure the cover bar adheres to the holder and not the globe.\n\t​NOTE: The area to be imaged is placed down because the protocol is written for use on an inverted microscope. The protocol can be adapted for upright microscopes using holders with a smaller inner radius and the removal of the cover bar. This will result in less globe stabilization.\n6. Sample imaging\nTurn on the microscope and environmental chamber and verify that the chamber is humidified. Set the environmental chamber to 35 °C and 5% CO2 for the duration of the experiment.\n\tNOTE: Microscopes with environmental chambers are preferable for this procedure to prevent dehydration and to keep the globe at optimal temperatures but are not required.\nPlace the coverslip, holder, and stabilized globe on the microscope stage within the environmental chamber and image using live cell imaging techniques9.\nPipette additional growth media onto the coverslip to prevent dehydration and maintain tissue viability. Ensure there is enough medium in the well to cover the globe in the holder. Depending on the duration of imaging, add fresh medium when needed throughout the experiment.\nBegin experiments using live cell imaging techniques and protocols. Use low power laser settings to preserve the tissue and prevent tissue damage in long-duration experiments. Use appropriate objectives for long working distances. The experiments in this manuscript were performed using a 20x objective.\n\tNOTE: The laser power and gain, experimental duration, location, and plane of imaging are all variables depending on the experimental parameters. Imaging experiments on intact globes ranging from 1 h to 4 h in duration have been performed successfully in past publications10.",
    "Record and save data in the preferred file format. The software used by the microscope produces .czi files for data recording.\nDispose of the globes as per the standard institutional protocols at the end of the protocol.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
