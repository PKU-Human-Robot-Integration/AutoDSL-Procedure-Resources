    "1. Preparation of Graphite Oxide\nNOTE: Graphite oxide is prepared according to Hummers' method10,11.\nAdd 3 g of graphite into 69 mL of concentrated H2SO4 and stir the solution until the graphite has completely dispersed. Add 1.5 g of sodium nitrite and leave it for 1 h while stirring. Then, place the container in an ice bath.\nAdd 9 g of potassium permanganate into the dispersion and remove the container from the ice bath. Allow the solution to warm up to room temperature.\nFirst, add 138 mL of distilled water dropwise. Then, continue to add 420 mL of distilled water. Maintain the temperature at 90 °C for 15 min using a hotplate. Add 7.5 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide to the dispersion.\nCollect the product by centrifugation at 10,000 x g for 20 min and discard the supernatant solution. Wash the pellet 4x with warm double-distilled water and 2x with a 10% HCl (v/v) solution. Finally, wash it 2x with ethanol and dry it at 50 °C in the oven.\n2. GO-deposited Electrode Preparation\nDisperse 10 mg of graphite oxide in 10 mL of water and then sonicate it in an ultrasonic bath for 6 h.\nRemove the unexfoliated graphite oxide flakes by centrifugation for 30 min at 2,700 x g. Discard the solid particles after centrifugation and use the supernatant for further experiments.\n\tNOTE: We used this exfoliated GO flakes dispersion as the stock solution.\nDilute the GO stock solution two-fold. Always prepare a fresh GO working solution from the stock solution.\nAdd 2 µL of the GO working solution on top of an exposed interdigitated gold electrode (Figure 1A and Figure 2). After drop casting, dry the electrode at room temperature for 12 h. This is the GO-deposited electrode.\n3. Reduction of GO to Electrochemically Reduced Graphene Oxide",
    "Insert the electrode in the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) electrode holder (bottom piece). Place the other part of the electrode holder, which serves as a solution reservoir, on top of the electrode as shown as in Figure 1A - 1C. Assemble the holders by clipping the two parts together using two paper clips. Make sure that the PDMS holder does not cover the GO-deposited electrode part.\nPipet 300 µL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) in the reservoir. Then, place the reference and the counter electrode in the solution in such a way that the electrodes are placed close to the surface of the GO film, as shown in Figure 1C. This set-up serves as an electrochemical cell to perform electrochemical reduction of GO and for polyaniline deposition.\nConnect the electrodes with the potentiostat connected to a computer for data acquisition. Use cyclic voltammetry for the electrochemical reduction: select 0 to -1.2 V as a potential range and 50 mV/s as the scan rate. Cycle the voltage over the electrode between 0 to -1.2 V 10x (Figure 3).\nAfter the experiment, remove the electrode from the holder and repeatedly wash it with double-distilled water. Then, dry the electrode in an oven at 101 °C for 12 h.\nWhen the electrode is dry, remove the electrode from the oven and allow it to cool down to room temperature. Then, measure the conductivity of the electrode with a multimeter. The electrode is now referred to as an electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) electrode.\n4. Polyaniline Functionalization of the ERGO Electrode\nPrepare 10 mM aniline monomer for the polyaniline functionalization. Dissolve 5 µL of 10 mM aniline in 5 mL of 1 M H2SO4.",
    "For the polyaniline functionalization, add 300 µL of aniline monomer to the solution reservoir. Place the ERGO-deposited electrode into the electrode holder as described in the procedure for GO reduction.\nUse cyclic voltammetry for the electropolymerization of aniline to functionalize ERGO into ERGA-polyaniline (ERGO-PA): select 0 to 0.9 V as a potential range and 50 mV/s as the scan rate. Cycle the voltage over the electrode between 0 to 0.9 V for 50x (Figure 4).\nAfter the polyaniline deposition, remove the electrode and repeatedly wash it with double-distilled water. Then, dry the electrode at 80 °C in the oven for 12 h.\nRemove the electrode from the oven and allow it to cool down to room temperature before measuring the conductivity of the electrode with a multimeter.\nPrepare a pH 5 buffer solution by adding 0.2 M NaOH to the Britton-Robinson buffer solution until pH 5 (see step 5.1). Keep the electrode in the buffer at pH 5 for 24 h.\n\t\nTo prepare a Britton-Robinson universal buffer solution, mix 0.04 mol of phosphoric acid, 0.04 mol of acetic acid, and 0.04 mol of boric acid in 0.8 L of ultrapure water. Add 0.2 M sodium hydroxide dropwise to the buffer solution until the desired pH is reached4. Add ultrapure water until the final volume is 1 L.\n5. ERGO-PA Electrode Testing at Different pH (Pre-calibration Before Nafion Coating)\nAfter conditioning the electrode in a pH 5 buffer solution, measure the resistance of the electrode in solutions of a different pH (from pH 4 to pH 9; see Figure 5).\n\t\nFor this measurement, dip the electrode directly into the buffer solution and connect the other part of the electrode to the computer-controlled potentiostat for data acquisition. Change the pH by titrating with 0.2 M NaOH.",
    "Choose chronopotentiometry or amperometry i-t curve from the list of techniques and apply a 100 mV potential difference to the electrode.\n\t\tNOTE: The potentiostat measures the current against time. The software controlling the potentiostat provides a graphical representation of the current against time.\nUse Ohm's law (resistance equals voltage divided by current) to calculate the resistance value from the measured current and applied voltage.\nAfter the measurements, dry the electrode at room temperature for 12 h.\n6. Preparation of the Nafion-coated ERGO-PA Electrode\nAdd 5 µL of 5 wt% Nafion on top of the ERGO-PA electrode and dry the electrode at room temperature for 12 h.\nAfter the Nafion coating, keep the electrode in the buffer solution at pH 5 for 24 h before pH measurements.\nAfter conditioning in pH 5, remove the Nafion-coated ERGO-PA electrode (ERGO-PA-NA) and measure the resistance of the electrode from pH 4 to pH 9 as mentioned in section 5.1 (Figure 6).\n7. Preparation of L. lactis Culture Medium\nAdd 9.3 g of M17 powder into 250 mL of ultrapure water. Slowly agitate the solution until the powder dissolves completely. Autoclave the solution at 121 °C for 15 min.\nTake a 250-mL sterilized flask with a magnetic stirrer bar and add 50 mL of the sterilized M17 medium to the flask. Then, add 8 mL of autoclaved 1 M glucose solution. Inoculate the solution with 10 µL of an L. lactis culture, previously grown in the same culture medium.\n\tNOTE: The bacterial strain was obtained from Jan Kok, Molecular Genetics, University of Groningen.\nPlace the flask with the inoculated culture medium for 18 h on a magnetic stirrer plate in an incubation oven at 30 °C while stirring and monitor the pH.\n8. Testing of the ERGO-PA-NA pH Response in an L. lactis Fermentation Experiment",
    "Place the ERGO-PA-NA electrode into the L. lactis culture and close it with a cotton plug. Then, place the set-up into the thermostat at 30 °C to grow L. lactis.\nApply 100 mV to the electrode and measure the current against time.\nTake 0.5-mL samples at different time points (see, for instance, Figure 7) to measure off-line the optical density at 600 nm and the pH with a conventional glass electrode. Continue the measurements until the optical density of the culture becomes constant, indicating that the bacteria are not growing anymore.\nSubscription Required.
