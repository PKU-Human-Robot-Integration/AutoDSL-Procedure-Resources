    "Test cageA circular perforation (5 cm diameter) is made in the floor in one of the extremes of the plexiglass cage (see Figure 1A). This modification allows the odor holder to be placed between the table and the test cage, keeping it stable and resistant to any pressure made by the mouse. Preparation of the odor solutionA stock solution is prepared by adding 1 µl of the odor, either almond or banana, to 1 ml of mineral oil (0.1% concentration) which is then aliqouted into 50 µl lots/batches in Eppendorf tube. All the tubes were sealed using parafilm to prevent evaporation from the tubes and were then stored at room temperature in a cardboard box protected from the light. Preparation of the scented filter paperThe filter paper is cut into small pieces (1 cm x 3 cm, Figure 1C). For the olfactory habituation test, 5 µl of the diluted odorant (0.1%) or mineral oil is applied using a pipet to one edge of the pre-cut filter paper, which is then placed inside of the odor holder, introducing only two thirds of the scented filter paper (see Figure 2). Note: It is important not to introduce completely the filter paper in the holder in order to avoid physical contact (i.e. with the tongue) from the mouse. When this happens there is high probability that the mouse will bite the odor source, making it difficult to score the olfactory exploration. Three odor holders were used for the test, one dedicated to the mineral oil, another to the banana odor and the last one to the almond odor. The holders were cleaned with 20% ethanol after every use.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141014/20141014234759_0662.jpgFigure 2. Procedure to place the scented filter paper inside the odor holder.",
    "The filter paper is bent along its longitudinal axis, and is then introduced (two thirds) into the tube of the odor holder. Before placing the odor holder into the test cage, verify that the filter paper does not change position.Olfactory habituation testThe test is performed during the light cycle with a standard temperature in an experimental room separate from the housing room. On day 0 the animals are food deprived for 24 h, starting 4 h after the onset of the light cycle. On day 1 (the test day) 30 min before the task all the necessary material (see above)  is prepared. The test cage is placed on the table and cleaned with 20% ethanol. Then, all the parameters concerning the video recording and scoring software are established, such as camera focus and contrast, position of the test cage in the right camera view field, etc. Once everything is set up, the first holder containing the mineral oil is placed in the test cage and the video recording is started. The mouse is placed in one of the extremes of the test cage opposite to the odor holder. The task consists of 5 min exposure to mineral oil or odor separated by 5 min inter-trial intervals; during this time the mouse remains in the test cage. In a given session, mice are first presented with only the holder containing the mineral oil. They are then presented with the first odorant during two successive trials (habituation).  Subsequently, they are presented the second odorant. The Figure 3 schematizes the different steps of the protocol.  Note: The presentation of the second odor is reflecting whether the animals can discriminate between odors, which are based on animal’s tendency to explore novel smell, and to control for a potential disinterest in the test odor. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.",

Immediately after arrival, mice are placed in individual cages for one week, where the body weight and food intake are monitored daily. On the test day, food deprived (24 h) animals are placed in the test cage and submitted to the presentation of first, the mineral oil, then, twice the odor A (almond or banana) and finally the odor B (almond or banana). Each presentation is followed by a rest time in which no odor or oil is presented. The time of exploration of the odor source is scored."
