    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation: Decapitation and tissue extraction [part 1]\nTiming: 20 min\nThe mouse brain is dissected after decapitation with a guillotine and placed inside the preparation ringer solution, which is constantly oxygenated. Note that to keep the slices healthy for a longer duration, the respective preparation ringer or mess ringer solution should be constantly oxygenated with carbogen. The preparation of microtome and oxygenation is to be done prior to sacrificing the animals.\nPrepare the surgery site with surgical scissors, standard pattern forceps with curved and serrated tips, fresh blades, and a spatula (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1999-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of brain slices and incubation with Aβ42 peptide\n(A) Overview of the setup required for the sacrifice of the mice. Isoflurane (5%) was used as the anesthetizing agent.\n(B) Close overview of the surgical set required for the dissection of mice brains. From the left, spoon, spatula, standard pattern forceps with curved tips and surgical scissor.\n(C) Microtome cutting through the sagittal section of the mouse brain.\n(D) Organotypic incubation of slice with Aβ42 peptide.\nKeep a beaker with the preparation ringer solution continuously oxygenated on the side.\nMake sure to keep the beaker in a box full of ice, to keep the preparation ringer in a slushy state.\nKeep another petri dish with oxygenated preparation ringer solution, which serves as a platform to dissect the brain from the decapitated head.\nAnesthetize the mouse by placing it in an isoflurane chamber with 5% isoflurane concentration and at a flow rate of 2 L/min. Wait until the animal is unresponsive. The standard and a reliable way to test whether the mouse is aptly anesthetized is by doing a twofold check.\nCheck for the instance when the mouse loses the righting reflex.",
    "Pinch the tail with the forceps and see if the mouse does not respond. Once, checked for these measures, bring the mice to the guillotine and decapitate the head.\nQuickly transfer the decapitated head to the petri dish containing preparation ringer solution.\nWith the help of sharp surgical scissors, cut open the scalp through the midline along the sagittal suture.\nMake a lateral cut on both the sides of skull and remove the top of the skull to expose the brain.\nCritical: Be careful while cutting through the joints of the skull particularly the bregma. If the bone does not fall off completely, it can be slowly removed using fine-tip forceps.\nFrom the caudal side, gently lift out the brain using the spatula. Quickly transfer the brain to iced-cooled preparation ringer solution in the beaker. Discard mouse body and head in the freezer, disinfect and clean guillotine, anesthetizing chamber and workspace.\nBring the brain to the microtome setup.\nTreatment: Sectioning (350 μm slice) and incubation with Aβ42 [part 2]\nTiming: 5 h\nSection the brain in the sagittal plane into 350 μm thick slices for incubation and treatment with the Aβ peptide. Sagittal sectioning best preserves the stratum radiatum layer of CA1 region of hippocampus. This section includes the incubation of slice for 30 min in water bath warmed to 35°C and then in the aCSF at RT (21°C to 24°C) for 1 h. This allows sufficient time for the recovery of slices.\nTransfer the brain to a small flat platform and cut off the cerebellum with a razor.\nSeparate the two hemispheres with a sharp razor blade.\nPut two streaks of tissue adhesive on the microtome cutting plate.\nDry both hemispheres of the brain by first transferring them on a filter paper for 2–3 s.",
    "Transfer the brain hemispheres to the tissue adhesive on the microtome plate and place the plate inside the holder.\nCarefully lock the plate and insert the razor blade inside the microtome.\nFix the cutting window in the microtome by setting the starting and the final position of brain.\nSet the thickness to 350 μm. Start trimming the hemispheres until anterior hippocampus starts to appear (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nStart collecting the slices and divide them into the respective beaker: control and treatment (Aβ42).\nCut slices and carefully transfer them to oxygenated mess ringer filled beakers in the water bath with a pipette (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCritical: Pay attention to the bubbles in the nets holding the slices. They directly affect the longevity of the slices. Also, make sure that the brain slices are not overlapping on each other. This would affect the health of the slices.\nCritical: To reduce the overcrowding of slices inside the beaker, one can trim off the rest of the brain area from the sagittal section of the brain keeping the hippocampus and cortex intact. This allows more slices to fit in the respective beakers.\nAfter completing the sectioning, place the beakers containing the slices in the water bath at 35°C for about 30 min, then remove it from the water bath, and incubate at RT (21°C to 24°C) for 1 h. This allows sufficient time for the revival of slice.\nFollow the incubation scheme as shown in the table below this step.\nPipette out 35 μL of Aβ42 in 70 mL of the aCSF solution into the treatment beaker to obtain 50 nM concentration of the Aβ42 and incubate the slices for a duration of 90 min at RT (21°C to 24°C). The Aβ42 would evenly mix by the continuous oxygenation.",
    "Leave the slices in the control chamber in the aCSF with continuous oxygenation for the same 90 min duration.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1999_3.csv\nCritical: The Aβ42 stock solution will begin to degrade at RT (21°C to 24°C). Twenty min prior to the starting of incubation with the amyloid beta oligomer, the Aβ42 can be brought to the RT (21°C to 24°C) to allow the contents to thaw, then place it back in the −20°C freezer.\nProcessing of brain slices [part 3]\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step is crucial for fixation and further cryopreservation. Hard fixatives like PFA allow covalent cross-linking between molecules and stabilizes the proteins. Place the slices in 30% sucrose solution for cryoprotection. It helps to prevent the ice crystal formation in the tissue and thereby avoid freeze-damage.\nDivide the slices into a 6-well plate and pour in adequate amount of 4% PFA to cover the slices. Incubate the slices overnight (16–20 h) on a 3D shaker at 4°C in 4% PFA solution.\nCritical: PFA is hazardous. Take adequate care while handling it. It should be freshly prepared and should not be reused multiple times. Dispose of properly in hazardous waste.\nOn the following day, wash the slices three times with 1× PBS for 10 min each.\nAdd 2 mL of 30% sucrose solution into each well and incubate for 2 days on 3D shaker at 4°C.\nCryosectioning: 30 μm brain section [part 4]\nTiming: 2–3 h per brain\nThe brain slices are further sectioned into 30 μm thick sections for better staining and effective immunofluorescence protocol. This step is crucial for obtaining good free-floating sections. Cracks or tear in the sections would directly affect the staining and mounting onto the slides.",
    "Pour in a small amount of the optimal cutting temperature (OCT) media on the sample disk and allow it to solidify. Carefully place the disk in the holder and trim the OCT compound until it becomes a flat surface.\nCritical: Make sure that the surface of the OCT is completely flat. The brain slices (350 μm) need to be kept on a flat surface to ensure uniform cutting of the brain sections.\nTake the specimen disk out, mark the position where you intend to place the brain slice. For our purpose, we marked the OCT with positions resembling the hands of a clock.\nPick up the brain slice by a spatula and place it horizontally on the specimen disk. Now cover the surface of slice with ample amount of OCT media and place the specimen disk back in the holder.\nStart trimming until the slices are reached. Once the slices are reached, set to desired thickness (30 μm) and start collecting the sections. (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) See Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] for detailed demonstration.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1999-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Cryosectioning of brain sections (30 μm)\n(A) The first step is to cover the specimen disk with the OCT mounting media. Flatten the surface by initially trimming off the OCT media and creating a smooth flat surface.\n(B) Place the brain slice (350 μm) horizontally on the surface of flattened OCT mounting medium. If not flat, gently press the brain slice to the surface and cover the surface with OCT.\n(C) Start trimming of extra parts of OCT before reaching the brain slice. Thin straight 30 μm sections as seen in the last image of the panel is produced at the end of this procedure.",
    "Critical: It is essential to make sure that the slices are laid flat on the OCT media. If necessary, it can softly be pressed using a brush/spatula to make the surface flat.\nCarefully cut 3–4 sections, take them up all at once with a metal pick and transfer them into 6-well plate filled with 1× PBS (the sections will unroll in the 1× PBS solution).\nNote: In an alternative scenario, if one wishes to do the staining not in a free-floating section, rather on a slide, the brain section can be made flat using an anti-roll plate and can directly be mounted on the slide. These slides can be stored in -80°C for a longer duration.\nIt is possible to obtain 6-7 good 30 μm sections from a single 350 μm sagittal slice of hippocampus. Collect enough sections in 1× PBS from both control and treatment groups.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Cryosectioning of hippocampal slices (30 μm) (step 16)\nImmunofluorescence staining [part 5]\nTiming: 3 days\nTo assess the synaptic engulfment of the “eat me signal” C1q protein, we perform the immunofluorescence on a sagittal section. The synaptic engulfment is further verified using a post-synaptic marker PSD95. The astrocytes are marked by using GFAP. Pre-select intact hippocampus sections using a brush and place them in the 6-well plate. Avoid putting too many sections into a single well, which would lead to overcrowding. A maximum of 3–4 sections per well is recommended.\nWash the sections three times with 1× PBS using a plastic Pasteur pipette. Handle the sections carefully.\nBlocking: Add 1 mL/well of blocking solution (10% NGS in 1× PBS + 0.3% triton-X) and block for 2 h at RT (21°C to 24°C) on a 3D shaker.",
    "Remove the blocking solution. Incubate with primary antibody (800 μL/well, diluted in 10% NGS) for 2 days at 4°C. Use Rabbit Anti C1q (1:250) for staining C1q protein, mouse anti GFAP (1:800) for staining astrocytes and rabbit anti-PSD95 (1:400).\nRemove the primary antibody and put it in a separate tube marked as recycled. These reused antibodies can be stored in −20°C and can be used for another round of staining.\nWash the sections three times with 1× PBS solution for 10 min each. Meanwhile prepare the secondary antibodies.\nIncubate the sections with respective secondary antibodies anti-mouse 647 (1:500) and anti-rabbit 488 (1:500) for 2 h at RT (21°C to 24°C). Cover the plate with a shielded cover (like aluminum foil) to keep it dark.\nWash the sections three times with 1× PBS solution for 10 min each.\nTake a petri dish filled with 1× PBS and transfer 3–4 sections from the 6-well plate into petri dish and carefully mount them flat on the slide. Use a brush to transfer and flatten them.\nNote: For an efficient and easy transfer of the section onto the slide, keep the slide tilted with half of its surface inside PBS. Carefully move up the section where the slide touches PBS and slowly pull out the slide. The section sticks onto the surface. If there are still small folds on the section, use a soft fine-ended brush and carefully adjust the section to make it flat.\nKeep the slides tilted on filter paper in the dark to dry. Mount the sections with a NucBlueTM mounting media.",
    "Critical: Each slide should not contain more than 4 brain sections. Extreme care should be taken while putting coverslip on the section. Put adequate amount (10 μL per hippocampus section) of the mounting media to avoid putting pressure on the section, which could affect the structure of the proteins under study, and thereby affecting rendering process in the further steps. Also, make sure not to introduce any air bubble into the specimen. An easier way to accomplish this would be to put a thin pipette head between the coverslip and the slide and slowly removing the pipette allowing the mounting media to slowly but evenly distribute above the sample. In any case, if there is still air bubble, avoid scratching the coverslip or applying direct pressure from the top, instead start removing the bubble by slowly applying pressure from the sides, particularly from the areas, which are distant from the brain specimen.\nCritical: For preserving the fluorescent signals for a longer period, keep the slides at −20°C. When kept at RT (21°C to 24°C), the fluorescent signal decays. Before imaging the slides on a confocal microscope, they can be briefly kept in at RT (21°C to 24°C) (20–30 min).\nConfocal imaging: “Hunting for astrocytes” [part 6]\nTiming: 2 h per brain",
    "We image high-resolution individual astrocyte from the stratum radiatum layer of CA1 region of hippocampus. The slides are double-immunofluorescent stained for astrocytes and either the complementary tag C1q protein or a postsynaptic marker PSD95 for reference. The images taken during the process are further deconvolved with the lightning function in the Leica software, to improve image resolution and contrast. For effective volumetric analysis of the synaptic engulfment by the astrocyte, it is essential to reduce the background noise. To effectively categorize the astrocyte, the nucleus/DNA is labeled with NucBlueTM present in the mounting media (nuclear stain). Since we are particularly focused on the CA1 area of hippocampus, it is also crucial to mark distinct layers and regions of the hippocampus, to effectively identify our region of interest and pick the astrocyte from the layer. Imaging is performed with three active fluorescent channels. Leica Microscope SP8 provides the user an advantage to have 2-hybrid detectors (HyD) which produce less noise. Apart from these HyD sensors, they also have an additional photomultiplier tube (PMT) sensor. Since the Leica microscope, has a maximum of two HyD sensors and the rest PMT sensors, it is essential to pick the correct proteins for the respective sensor. To make things easier, it is always advisable to keep large, ubiquitous or uniformly expressed proteins in the PMT sensor and the proteins of interest for colocalization and for the analysis of the synaptic engulfment to be kept in the HyD sensor. In our case, we detect the nuclear (NucBlueTM) signal with the PMT sensor and GFAP and C1q/PSD95 signals using with the HyD sensors.\nSwitch on the confocal 30 min prior to imaging. Care should be taken to calibrate the stage before imaging.",
    "While starting the system the LASX provides the option to initialize the calibration of the stage. This should always be switched on. Non-calibration will interfere while taking the z-stacks.\nThe laser power should also be stabilized before imaging. On a first-hand rule we switch on the laser after the confocal has been switched on for at least 15–20 min.\nThe primary step here is to locate the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Using the widefield fluorescence imaging mode, start from a lower magnification (10×/0.40 NA) and (20×/0.75 NA). Having a nuclear stain in the regiment of fluorophores greatly helps in identifying the region of interest (CA1) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1999-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Scale Bar 10 μm.\n(D) Schematic representation of different regions of hippocampus. The astrocytes are selected from the stratum radiatum layer, which is illustrated in magenta and is marked using a red rectangular box.",
    "Note: In our experience, it is easier to locate the dentate gyrus (V shaped structure) in the hippocampus first and then track down the CA1 area of the hippocampus. While finding the stratum radiatum of the CA1 can be tricky, it can be eased by locating the pyramidal layer, which is densely packed with nuclear bodies as seen in the NucBlueTM channel. The stratum radiatum layer (marked by a red box) is directly below the densely stained pyramidal layer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nOnce the region has been identified, switch to 63× (oil)/1.40 NA for single cell acquisition of astrocytes. Put one drop of immersion oil.\nAdjust all three channels: Blue, Green and Red with the parameters as suggested above. Slowly move across the XY plane and look for well-processed and structured astrocytes. The z-stack is set according to the GFAP channel in a way that it covers the entire volume of the astrocyte. The step size can be changed as per needs and demands of the experiment (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). The green channels (C1q/PSD95) are imaged in this z stack range.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1999-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Scale Bar 100 μm.\n(B) Detailed view of the settings for acquiring the image.\n(C) Lasers used for acquiring the image.\nNote: The step size to be chosen greatly depends on what analysis; the researcher wants to perform with the astrocytes. For instance, if someone were looking to characterize the structural analysis or the branching complexity of the astrocyte we would recommend having a smaller step size (0.2 μm–0.25 μm) to have a detailed structural outlook of the astrocytes.",
    "Click on “Start Experiment” to start taking acquisition of all the three channels. For an individual astrocyte, this could take between 5-8 min depending on the step size and the volume of astrocyte under consideration.\nDeconvolution: To improve resolution and signal to noise (S/N) ratio, we recommend performing deconvolution of the images. The lightning function from the Leica Confocal SP8 allows one to deconvolve the images before they are exported to Imaris for further analysis.\nNote: The lightning function uses Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm and a physically modeled Point Spread Function, which is adapted to the respective imaging method (confocal, STED, multiphoton, etc.). The parameters to be considered are regularization and smoothing. The Regularization parameter determines how strongly to average over a certain radius around a voxel. For the highest possible gain in resolution (with good signal-to-noise (SNR) in the raw data), this value should be set as low as possible (e.g., to 0.01 or even 0), with a low SNR this value should be set as high as possible (e.g., to 0.7) to avoid artifacts. The settings used for our image acquisition are found in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nCritical: Switch off the smoothing function for the GFAP channel, which might cause changes in the astrocyte structure and therefore affect the morphometric analysis.",
    "Critical: The regularization parameter is paramount to having a better signal to noise ratio. It represents to what extent a signal is interpreted as background or noise. Having an accurate adjustment of this parameter is essential to avoid false positives. The higher the value, the more severe constraints are applied to avoid the risk of deconvolution artifacts. However, this also increases the chance that information carrying signal will be discarded and thus the highest resolution enhancement might not be achieved. We use the default settings of the LASX regularization parameter for the deconvolution of the image. The Regularization parameter determines how strongly to average over a certain radius around a voxel. This value is proportional to the full width at half maximum of the point spread function (PSF) of the optical system. The regularization parameter also depends on the SNR ratio (Dey et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). With a good SNR the regularization value should be set at the lower side and vice versa (described in step 33).\nNote: If the confocal microscope does not have an inbuilt deconvolution software, one can use the deconvolution function from the Imaris Package.\nFiles can be saved in the appropriate “xxx.lif” format and can be exported to Imaris directly for quantification of synaptic pruning.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1999-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "Digital processing: Measurement of synaptic engulfment [part 7]\nTiming: 15 min per astrocyte\nThis part is essential for the measurement of the synaptic engulfment of the C1q protein by the astrocytes. The procedure involves 3D volumetric reconstruction of individual astrocytes and colocalization analysis to calculate the C1q protein inside the entire volume of the astrocyte. PSD95, postsynaptic marker has also been used as a reference to calculate the synaptic engulfment. Correct rendering of astrocyte volume forms a major step in the subsequent colocalization analysis.\nCritical: For proteins expressed uniformly throughout the tissue, it might be necessary to perform a background subtraction, with a filter width suitable to the spatial distribution of the protein. This improves the signal to noise ratio. The background subtraction can be done in Imaris by clicking on the image processing and selecting background subtraction for the respective channel. In our case, the deconvolution using the lightning function from the Leica Confocal SP8 was sufficient to obtain high-resolution imaging for all the channels.\nOpen the file in the Imaris software. Select “Add new surface” (blue oval like structure imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1999-Fx4.jpg) from the tab menu.\nThe creation of the surface around the astrocyte takes place in 4 steps. To segment individual astrocyte, select “Segment only a region of Interest” under the “Algorithm Settings” box.\nNote: Select the region of interest by dragging in through the X-Y plane. One can use pull arrows to restrict the region of interest (step 1 of 4).\nIn the next step, unselect the smooth option for the astrocyte. The smooth function as described before can affect the morphology of the astrocytes and thereby interfere with the final analysis (2/4). An overall visual guide to surface construction around the astrocyte is provided in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1999-Fig7.jpg",
    "Figure 7. A visual guide through the four different steps of surface building on the astrocyte\n(A) In step 2 select the red channel (GFAP), disable the smoothing option to avoid changes to the morphology of astrocytic surface.\n(B) In step 3 the intensity threshold is selected for the red channel (For a detailed understanding of how to balance the threshold refer to Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). While Imaris provides an automatic threshold for the surface reconstruction, we recommend adjusting the threshold manually for a more consistent and better rendering of the astrocyte.\n(C) While the surface construction of the astrocyte, there are small unwanted disjoint signals produced in the background. In step 4, we filter these small disjoint signals using a volume threshold filter.\n(D) The surface of the astrocyte is rendered. Scale Bar 10 μm.\nNext, we render the surface of the astrocyte by adjusting the signal threshold corresponding to the GFAP channel. One can manually slide the bar, under the “Threshold” tab to select the surface. Although there is an automatic threshold which is suggested by the Imaris, we suggest using the manual way to set the threshold in a way that the surface covers the complete astrocyte (3/4) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nCritical: This step is crucial and plays an essential role in directly affecting the colocalization analysis. Correct rendering of astrocyte is essential to quantify the synaptic engulfment. Both over rendering and under rendering can provide false sets of data. We therefore recommend an iterative approach (or trial and error approach) and, once a surface is created, compare with the original image, see if the surface is rendered in the proper way (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). If not, come back to step 39 and repeat it again, until the surface encloses all visible processes!",
    "In the next step, we can adjust the additional rendering required for achieving the volumetric rendering of astrocyte. For this step, set the filter to volume and manually adjust the threshold to remove small particle. We used a volume filter of 0.2 μm3, to exclude unwanted particles.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1999-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Creating the balance for a correct threshold for 3D rendering of astrocyte\n(A) Original image showing astrocyte (red) and C1q (green).\n(B) Example of under representation of the surface of the astrocyte. In this case, the threshold is not adequately selected, and several astrocytic filaments are not covered by the surface function.\n(C) Over rendering of the surface. Having the threshold set too high, would introduce unnecessary and unreliable processes on the astrocyte.\n(D) A balanced threshold should always be selected for the correct rendering of the astrocyte. The rendered astrocyte is now processed to further remove any other background signals. Scale Bar 10 μm. Scale Bar for zoomed in section (inset) 5 μm.\nNote: However, if the experimenter feels that additional small disjointed particles need to be removed, this parameter can be changed accordingly. However, to avoid any kind of bias leave the same setting for all the astrocytes (4/4) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C).\nClick the green arrow button on step 4 to complete the rendering of the astrocyte. If desired rendering is not achieved, the user is advised to start again from step 39. This loop is to be followed until the desired rendering of astrocyte is achieved (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D). For a demonstration of steps, 37–40, see Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2].",
    "Note: If a user intends to perform morphometric analysis of the astrocytes along with the colocalization study, Imaris provides an option to export all the statistics regarding the structural complexity and the branching details of the astrocyte. Click on the “Statistics” tab. Select all the parameters that you intend to study in the dropdown list “Export Statistics on Tab Display to file”. If the user intends to study all the parameters, select “Export all statistics to file”. The file can either be exported in “xxx.csv” or in “xxx.xls” format. These sets of data can be further analyzed.\nThe next step is to process the rendered astrocyte (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]A). Usually even after careful surface reconstruction of the astrocyte, there are several unwanted signals or sometimes processes from other astrocytes, which need to be filtered out before proceeding to the next step.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1999-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9.

Scale Bar 10 μm.\nThis is achieved by selecting all the unwanted background signal (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]B) using the “Circle Selection Mode” (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]D).",
    "Choose the delete option under “Edit” tab (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]E). These unwanted signals are now filtered from the astrocyte (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]C). For a demonstration of this step, see Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3].\nThe next step is to mask the surface of the astrocyte. To achieve this, click on the “Edit” tab under a newly built surface. Click “Mask All” option (Figures 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]A and 10B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1999-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10.

Select the channel in which the astrocyte is present (red) and set the voxels outside surface to 0.\n(D) The masked surface of the astrocyte appears and in the display adjustment box, in addition to blue, red and green channel, the masked red channel appears. Scale Bar 10 μm.\nThe mask channel box opens. Under the channels, select GFAP (Red) channel. Set voxels outside the surface to 0. This is to eliminate any signal, which is outside the surface that has been rendered. This step further reduces any false positives resulting from the background signal (Figures 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]C and 10D). For a demonstration of steps, 42–43, see Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4].",
    "Note: To quantify the synaptic engulfment, we use the colocalization analysis. The coloc analysis of Imaris analyzes the contact between the C1q protein (Green) and the astrocyte surface. Using the masked red channel, we can calculate the colocalization between the C1q and the astrocyte. The percentage of region of interest (Astrocyte) colocalized with the neuronal tag can be exported in a separate file in .csv format. In this part, we are focusing on the colocalization between C1q and GFAP (Astrocytes). However, this analysis can be extended to different post-synaptic and pre-synaptic markers.\nSelect the Coloc tab in the Imaris (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1999-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. Guide for the colocalization analysis with Imaris\nOpen the Coloc tab (imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1999-Fx5.jpg) which is present on the side of “Image Processing” option.\n(A) For setting the threshold of channel A select unambiguous punctum as is shown in the figure. Scale Bar for zoomed in section (inset) 0.5 μm.\n(B) Right click on each punctum and drag to create a boundary around each punctum. The boundary is shown by an arrow. Make sure that the yellow boundary covers the entire individual green signal. The intensity threshold for channel A (green) is selected by averaging the intensities of 10 unambiguous green puncta selected by setting the boundary around each signal. A correct boundary is shown with a tick on the left and a wrong boundary setting is shown on the right with a cross sign. Scale Bar for zoomed in section (inset) 0.1 μm.\n(C) For the channel B (masked red), the threshold is set at 1.\n(D) Imaris does provide an option for automatic thresholding which can be done clicking on the calculate threshold option as shown in the figure. However, this produces inconsistent results and therefore we do not recommend using this method for the colocalization.",
    "Imaris allows the selection of 2 channels to be analyzed for the colocalization. In the first channel (A) select green (C1q) (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]A). The next step is to set the threshold intensity for the green channel.\nNote: While Imaris provides an automatic way to determine threshold, we have found this approach gives inconsistent and unreliable results (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]D). The better way to analyze the threshold for green channel is by setting a manual threshold.\nSelect the manual threshold for the green channel by randomly selecting 10 unambiguous green dots and averaging the intensity to set the threshold for the green channel.\nLeft click and drag on a green punctum in a way that the boundary set (yellow as shown in Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]B) by Imaris completely covers the signal (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]B).\nFind the mean value of the 10 randomly selected C1q protein signals and set the threshold intensity of channel A. Averaging the intensity from multiple puncta ensure a balanced threshold for the image.\nCritical: While Imaris recommends setting the threshold for both the channels, using the 2D histogram, in our experience it is better to proceed with manual threshold instead of using the 2D histogram, as it produces inconsistent results.\nCritical: While encircling the boundary of a positive C1q signal, care should be taken to completely encircle the boundary. Wrong acquirement could produce false results in the colocalization analysis.\nIn the channel B select the masked GFAP and set the intensity threshold for the channel B (Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]C). This is relatively easy as compared to the setting of the threshold for channel A. During the masking protocol, we eliminated the background signal by threshold masking of the original GFAP channel. Therefore, the threshold intensity of this channel can be directly set at 1.",
    "Towards the bottom in the right side, select the define “Region of Interest” tab. This is a crucial step in the analysis of the final set of the data. Since we intend to calculate the colocalization over the whole volume of astrocyte, we select the masked GFAP channel and set the threshold as 1 (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1999-Fig12.jpg\nFigure 12. Generation of colocalization statistics\n(A) In the “Define Region of Interest (ROI)” box in the lower right corner, select mask dataset and select the masked red channel in the channel box.\n(B) The colocalization analysis produces a set of data which define % of colocalization. These values can be exported to a separate “xxx.csv” file. The % of ROI colocalized is of interest to us as it gives us the measurement of synaptic engulfment by the astrocyte.\n(C) Representative Dataset showing % colocalization of GFAP and C1q between control and Aβ42 treated slices. Data is plotted as mean ± SEM of six animals per group and is analyzed by unpaired two-tailed t-test. Mean ± SEM of each group: Control (1.332 ± 0.1169) and Aβ42 (1.884 ± 0.1597). ∗p < 0.05, significantly different from control group.\nThe last step of the analysis is to “Build Coloc Channel”.\nA new tab opens with different parameters analyzed.\nThe whole file can be exported as a “xxx.csv” file. To our interest, is the % of ROI colocalized, where we have defined the ROI as the astrocyte mask (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]A). This gives us an estimation of the amount of C1q tag present in the whole volume of the astrocyte.\nThis can be transferred to a master excel file consisting of data from several other astrocytes and in both control and treatment samples for the final statistical analysis (Figure 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]B).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",
