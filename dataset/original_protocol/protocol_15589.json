    "All steps are performed at room temperature unless otherwise indicated. All C57BL/6J mice used were obtained from the Laboratory Animal Center of Wuhan University, and all the related experiments were approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Wuhan University. All efforts were made to minimize the suffering of the mice.\n1. Enucleation and fixation of the eyes\nEuthanize the mice with carbon dioxide asphyxiation, and enucleate the eyeball gently using toothless tweezers.\nRinse the eyeball once in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nPuncture the eyeball with a syringe needle at the cornea under a microscope (eyepiece WF: 10x/22; continuous magnification objective: 0.67x-4.5x) to accelerate the fixation into the eyeball and improve the fixing efficiency.\nTransfer to a 24-well plate containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nFix the eyeball in 4% PFA for 45 min, and then transfer it to 1x PBS to remove excess PFA (wash three times, 5 min/time) immediately.\n2. Retina isolation and flattening\nTransfer the eyeball to a glass slide, and place it under a dissecting microscope (eyepiece WF: 10x/22; continuous magnification objective: 0.67x-4.5x).\nHold the forceps in one hand, and use it to clamp the margin of the cornea to prevent eyeball movement. Use the other hand to hold the dissecting scissors and cut around the cornea at approximately 1 mm of depth through the corneoscleral limbus. Remove the lens and vitreous body.\nHold the optic disc at the center, and using dissecting scissors, cut the retina radially along the four quadrants, reaching approximately 2/3 of the radius of the retina.\nClamp one of the scleral edges using toothed forceps. With the other hand, hold the edge of the sclera with untoothed forceps, and move from where the sclera is fixed by the toothed forceps toward the base of the sclera. Carefully peel the retina.",
    "Draw off PBS using a pipette (200 µL) to flush and wet the retina, and then remove any excess PBS with a small piece of absorbent paper. If needed, gently flatten the retina with a small bristle brush.\nSlowly pipette cold methanol (precooled in a −20°C freezer) drop by drop onto the inner surface of the retina (the volume of methanol is not fixed, as long as the retina can be completely coveredby the methanol). The retina turns white and develops increased tenacity.\nGently flatten the retina, and remove impurities such as residual pigment membranes and the vitreous body with small bristle brushes. Invert the retina using small bristle brushes, and repeat the above-mentioned process.\nTransfer the methanol-treated retina into a well of a 24-well plate, and keep it soaked in methanol.\nStore it at −20°C for 1-2 h for immediate immunostaining, or leave the retina in methanol, and store it at −20°C for long-term storage.\nRemove the methanol from the 24-well plate, and rinse the retina with 1x PBS.\n3. Immunofluorescent staining of the RGCs\nCarefully transfer the retina to a 24-well hemagglutination plate with a plastic Pasteur pipette, and block in 5% PBS-TX-BSA (5 g of bovine serum albumin powder dissolved in 100 mL of 1x PBST solution; the PBST is formed by adding 10 mL of Triton X-100 to 2,000 mL of 1 x PBS) at room temperature for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C. Keep the ganglion side up.\nRemove the PBS-TX-BSA, and incubate the retina at 4 °C for 48-96 h, adding 100 µL of the selected primary antibody (guinea pig anti-RBPMS antibody) using a 1:400 dilution.\nRemove the primary antibody, and rinse the retina three times (20 min each) with 1x PBS, shaking at room temperature.",
    "Incubate the retina with gentle shaking overnight at 4 °C with 100 µL of the corresponding secondary antibody (see Table of Materials), cyanine Cy3 affiniPure donkey anti-guinea pig IgG (H+L), using a 1:400 dilution.\nRinse the retina with 1x PBS three times (20 min each).\nLay the retina flat on the slide with the ganglion cell layer facing upward, drop an appropriate amount of anti-fluorescence quenching agent around the retina with a pipette, and cover the slide with a coverslip (be careful not to have bubbles).\n\tNOTE: To determine the appropriate amount of anti fluorescence quencher, ensure that it covers the entire retina. After that, cover the slide without allowing the retina to float and move easily.\nSeal the slide all around with a sealing agent to prevent it from moving. Store the samples at −20°C, and protect them from light.\nImage the retina using a fluorescence/confocal microscope.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
