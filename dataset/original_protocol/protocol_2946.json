    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nTransduction of Mice with Adenovirus Expressing hACE2 – Day 0\nTiming: ∼1 h\nThaw aliquots of Ad5-hACE2 and Adenovirus without hACE2 expression (Ad5-empty) stock by slowly swirling in water at 23°C.\nStore the thawed virus on ice during the procedure.\nAnesthetize mice with ketamine/xylazine (17.5 mg/mL ketamine; 2.5 mg/mL xylazine) at a dose of 100 μL/20 g body weight of mouse through intraperitoneal injection.\nEnsure the mouse is completely sedated before proceeding to the next step.\nTransduce mice intranasally using a P200 micropipette with 2.5 × 108 PFU of Ad5-hACE2 or Ad5-empty (negative control) in 75 μL DMEM per mouse.\nDispense the virus dropwise on the nostril of the mouse. Allow the mouse to inhale the drop of virus before applying the next drop (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nObserve the mouse for normal breathing, light chest massage can be given if the mouse exhibit difficulty breathing.\nTransfer transduced mice to a separate container and repeat steps 4–7 until all mice are transduced.\nReturn transduced mice to animal cages. Check to make sure mice are conscious before returning them to animal facility. It usually takes around 30–45 min for the mice to recover from anesthesia. Allow mice to recover for 5 days before proceeding to step 10.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S1. Intranasal Inoculation (Refer to Step 5, Step 10, and Steps 80–83 of the Step-By-Step Protocol)\nIntranasal Infection of SARS-CoV-2 – Day 5\nTiming: ∼1 h\nRepeat steps 1–8 on day 5 post transduction for intranasal infection, but replace Ad5-hACE2 or Ad5-empty with SARS-CoV-2 and dilute the virus stock to achieve 1 × 105 PFU of SARS-CoV-2 in 50 μL of DMEM for each mouse.",
    "Note: Infected mice should be monitored daily for weight change and disease progression. Try to weigh mice at the same time every day to avoid intraday fluctuation. (Sun et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Also, we took the day of infection with SARS-CoV-2 as day 0 and did not weigh mice before day 0. All steps involving SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in a BSL3 laboratory with appropriate PPE.\nCritical: Before transducing or infecting mice, make sure the mice are completely anesthetized so that the mice remain totally still when virus droplets are applied onto the nose as they inhale. Excessive movement of the mice may result in incomplete inhalation of the virus droplets if mice are not properly sedated. When dispensing the virus on the nostril, do not place the tip inside the nostril. The virus should be applied onto the nose. It is critical to apply the next drop only when the previous drop has been inhaled.\nHarvest Virus by Homogenizing Lungs for Validation of Infection\nTiming: ∼1 h\nAnesthetize mice with ketamine/xylazine (17.5 mg/mL ketamine; 2.5 mg/mL xylazine, intraperitoneal injection) at a lethal dose of 300 μL/20 g body weight.\nEnsure the mouse is completely sedated by observing pedal reflex before proceeding to the next step.\nPosition the mouse on an absorbent bench pad on top of a polystyrene foam board so that the ventral side of the mouse faces upwards.\nAttach the limbs of the mouse to the foam board with 25 g × 5/8 inch needles.\nSpray the ventral side of the mouse with 70% ethanol.\nLift up the fur/skin close to the urethral opening with forceps. Incise the skin midline from the urethral opening up to the mandible with surgical scissors.",
    "Pull the fur/skin on both sides of the mouse sideways with forceps to peel the skin off the underlying tissues.\nIncise the abdominal wall midline by lifting up with forceps until the base of the thorax. Open the abdominal cavity by making transverse incisions on both sides of the midline.\nMake an incision on the diaphragm right under the sternum and cut the diaphragm following the costal arch. Expose the lungs and heart by removing the ribcage.\nPrepare a 10 mL syringe filled with sterile DPBS. Insert a 25 g × 5/8 inch needle to the apex of the right ventricle and tear off the left atrium with forceps.\nPerfuse the lungs by injecting at least 5 mL of DPBS into the right ventricle.\nAfter perfusion, remove the lungs from the thoracic cavity and weigh in a weighing dish.\nPlace the lung into a sterile, disposable tissue homogenizer and add 1 mL DPBS.\nHomogenize the lungs in DPBS by grinding inside the homogenizer.\nTransfer the homogenates into a 2 mL screw-top sterile vial.\nSamples are stored at −80°C.\nNote: When harvesting organs other than the lungs, transcardiac perfusion should be performed by inserting needle to the apex of the left ventricle with puncture of the right atrium. Also, lung homogenates can be briefly pulsed down for 10 s after thaw before use. Viral titers of lung homogenate can be quantified by plaque assay or focus-forming assay.\nSARS-CoV-2 Plaque Assay – Day 0\nTiming: ∼30 min\nPlaque assay serves to determine viral titer by revealing individual infectious virion with overlaying media that limit virus spread only to neighboring cells.",
    "Seed Vero E6 cells with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS at approximately 1.25 × 105 cells per well in 12-well plate so that they reach >95% confluency the next day (after 16 h) (day 1).\nSARS-CoV-2 Plaque Assay – Day 1\nTiming: ∼1 h for processing and 3 days for incubation\nPrepare a 48-well dilution plate by adding 720 μL serum-free DMEM to each well.\nThaw lung homogenates by slowly swirling in water at 23°C. Pulse centrifuge the vial for 10 s to clarify the homogenates.\nKeep the thawed lung homogenates on ice during the procedure.\nSerially dilute the samples by 10-fold with serum-free DMEM by transferring 80 μL of virus sample to the first well of the 48-well plate and mix well by pipetting up and down.\nRepeat the dilution process by adding 80 μL from the current well to the next dilution well.\nRemove the media from each well of the 12-well plate. Wash with 500 μL of DPBS and remove DPBS from the wells.\nAdd 200 μL of diluted virus from the 48-well plate to each well of the 12-well plate in the order of the highest dilution to the lowest dilution.\nIncubate the 12-well plate at 37°C incubator with 5% CO2 for 1 h and rotate the plate every 15 min to keep cells from dessicating.\nMelt sterile 1.2% agarose in PBS (in a 50 mL Falcon tube) by heating in a microwave oven for 2 min or until melted. Keep the melted 1.2% agarose in a 65°C water bath.\nRemove 200 μL inocula from each well after 1 h of incubation. Mix the melted 1.2% agarose at 56°C with 2× DMEM at 37°C (1:1, v/v; i.e., for 3 × 12-well plate, 20 mL of 1.2% agarose + 20 mL of 2× DMEM).",
    "Immediately add 1 mL of agarose/growth media mixture to each well by a 10 mL serological pipette.\nWait for the agar overlay to solidify, add 500 μL of DMEM with 10% FBS on top of the solid agar and incubate cells at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3 days.\nSARS-CoV-2 Plaque Assay – Day 4\nTiming: ∼1 h\nRemove the residual media on top of the agar overlay from each well.\nAdd 1 mL of 10% formaldehyde (∼37.5 mL PBS + ∼12.5 mL 37% formaldehyde) each well and incubate at 23°C for 20 min to fix cells and inactivate viruses.\nRemove the liquid and agar overlay using curved forceps.\nAdd 0.1% crystal violet (5 mL of 1% crystal violet + 45 mL PBS) to each well to delineate plaques.\nIncubate at 23°C until plaques are visible.\nRemove the crystal violet, rinse wells with PBS, and count plaques.\nNote: When preparing the dilution plate, add serum-free DMEM to enough wells so that the intended dilution factor is achieved. The volume of serum free DMEM added to each well of the dilution plate can vary according to the final volume of diluted virus required for infection. In our experiments, we routinely use 200 μL of diluted virus in 12-well plates for plaque assay with technical triplicate for each dilution (4 dilutions can be tested in a 12-well plate). Therefore, we dilute 80 μL of virus into 720 μL of serum-free DMEM serially to achieve serial 10-fold dilution. Also, always pipette at least 10 μL of virus or solution to avoid pipetting errors. When counting plaques, choose a dilution with easily distinguished plaques (10–20 plaques) and calculate titer in plaque-forming units per mL (PFU/mL): PFU/mL = (plaques/well) × (dilution factor)/(mL inoculum), and calculate PFU/g according lung weight.\nSARS-CoV-2 Focus-Forming Assay – Day 0",
    "Timing: ∼30 min\nThe idea of focus-forming assay is similar to that of plaque assay which reveals individual infectious virion. However, instead of observing plaque formation in plaque assay, focus-forming assay visualizes intracellular antigen of the virus by immunostaining which can be done with higher-throughput and in shorter amount of time.\nSeed Vero E6 cells with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (2 x104 cells/well) in a 96-well plate.\nSARS-CoV-2 Focus-Forming Assay – Day 1\nTiming: ∼2 h\nThaw samples and warm 1.6% methylcellulose in DPBS to 37°C in water bath.\nSerially 10-fold dilute lung homogenates in DMEM containing 2% FBS serum DMEM (20 μL of sample with 180 μL DMEM).\nAspirate cell culture medium from the plate.\nTransfer 50 μL of diluted virus to each well and incubate the cells at 37°C for 1 h. Rotate gently every 15 min to keep cells from drying out.\nRemove infecting inocula after 1 h.\nAdd 100 μL/well pre-warmed (37°C) 1.6% methylcellulose in DMEM with 2% FBS.\nIncubate the cells for another 24 h at 37°C.\nSARS-CoV-2 Focus-Forming Assay – Day 2\nTiming: ∼2 h\nFix the cells with 200 μL/well 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 1 h at 23°C.\nRemove fixative and wash with 200 μL/well PBS three times.\nPermeabilize cells with 50 μL/well 0.2% Triton X-100 with 1% BSA for 30 min at 23°C.\nWash with 200 μL/well PBS three times.\nIncubate permeabilized cells with 50 μL/well of rabbit anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein polyclonal antibody (1:1000) in PBS with 1% BSA at 37°C for 1 h.\nDiscard primary antibody and wash three times with 200 μL/well PBST (0.1% Tween) and remove residue liquid completely.\nAdd 50 μL/well goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP (1:5000) in PBS with 1% BSA and incubate at 37°C for 1 h.",
    "Discard secondary antibody and wash three times with 200 μL/well PBST (0.1% Tween), remove residue liquid completely.\nAdd 50 μL/well True Blue, shake the plate on a shaker for 5–10 min at 23°C.\nRemove TrueBlue and Wash with 200 μL/well ddH2O, completely remove residue liquid, and count the foci by ELISPOT reader.\nNote: For each sample, choose a dilution with easily distinguished foci (e.g., 20–200 per well) and calculate titer in focus-forming units per mL (FFU/mL): FFU/mL = (foci/well) × (dilution factor)/(mL inoculum), and calculate FFU/g according lung weight.\nSARS-CoV-2 Plaque Reduction Neutralization Assay – Day 0\nTiming: ∼30 min\nPlaque reduction neutralization assay measures the reduction of the number of plaques of a virus standard with known titer so as to infer the neutralizing titers in the sample being tested.\nSeed Vero E6 cells in 12-well plate that will reach >95% confluency the next day (day 1).\nSARS-CoV-2 Plaque Reduction Neutralization Assay – Day 1\nTiming: ∼3 h for processing and 3 days for incubation\nSerially two-fold dilute the mouse serum in 400 μL of serum-free DMEM to reach a 2× concentration of the final concentration to be tested in a 48-well plate. Pipette up and down to mix well.\nThaw aliquots of SARS-CoV-2 stock by slowly swirling in water at 23°C.\nStore the thawed virus on ice during the procedure.\nDilute the virus in serum-free DMEM to achieve a concentration of around 80–100 PFU of virus in 400 μL. Pipette up and down to mix well.\nTransfer 400 μL of the diluted virus to the 400 μL of the diluted sample. Pipette up and down to mix well.\nRepeat until all the diluted samples of different concentration contain virus.\nIncubate the virus/sample mix at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 1 h.",
    "Remove the media from 12-well plate of Vero E6 cells.\nAdd 200 μL of diluted virus/sample mix to each well in the order of the highest dilution to the lowest dilution.\nRepeat steps 36–40 in SARS-CoV-2 plaque assay – day 1 with the virus/sample mix.\nSARS-CoV-2 Plaque Reduction Neutralization Assay – Day 4\nTiming: ∼1 h\nRepeat steps 41–46 in SARS-CoV-2 plaque assay – day 4.\nNote: Equal volume of virus and diluted sample should be used. The sample is diluted into a 2× concentration in step 65. For example, for a 1:20 dilution of the sample, it is diluted to 1:10 in 400 μL of serum-free DMEM so that when mixed with 400 μL of virus, the final concentration of the sample is1:20 (1×). Also, technical triplicates should be performed for each dilution. A total of 800 μL of virus/sample mix is sufficient for a triplicate technical repeat for a single dilution. In a 12-well plate format, four dilutions each with three technical repeats are performed. The total volume of virus therefore to be prepared is 1.6 mL (400 μL × 4). In addition, a triplicate well control can be performed with the virus alone to obtain the actual PFU per well without neutralization.\nVenezuelan Equine Encephalitis Replicon Particle Immunization\nTiming: ∼6 weeks\nVRPs are replication-competent and propagation-deficient which transduce cells with replicon of Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus genome incorporated with gene of interest as a mean to introduce viral antigen for immunization.",
    "Uninfected mice were immunized with 1 × 105 Infectious Units of VRPs expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane protein (M), envelope protein (E) or GFP through footpad injection or intranasally. Mice were primed and boosted once (3 weeks after priming) at the same dose through footpad injection or intranasally. Sera were collected 1–2 weeks after booster.
