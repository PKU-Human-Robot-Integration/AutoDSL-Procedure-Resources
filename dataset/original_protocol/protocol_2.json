    "1. Streak yeast cell EGY48 with p8op-lacZ reporter plasmid on SD-Ura plate for 3-5 days \\(at 30 <sup>o</sup>C). Scrape an entire colony \\(2-3 mm in diameter) into 1 ml of YPD medium, Vortex vigorously to disperse any clumps. Transfer this into a flask containing YPD:\n  Small Scale: 50 ml in 250 ml flask\nLibrary Scale: 150 ml in 500 ml flask\nIncubate at 30 <sup>o</sup>C overnight \\(16-18 hr) with shaking \\(at 250 rpm) to stationary phase \\(OD<sub>600</sub> greater than/equal to 1.5).\n2. Early the next morning, transfer overnight culture \\(enough to produce an OD<sub>600</sub>=0.2-0.3) into this volume of YPD:\n  Small Scale: 300 ml in 1L flask\nLibrary Scale: 1000 ml in 2L flask\n3. Incubate at 30 <sup>o</sup>C for 3 hr with shaking \\(230 rpm). The OD<sub>600</sub> will be 0.5 plus/minus 0.1. \n  \n4. Place cells in 50-ml tubes and centrifuge at 1500 rpm in floor centrifuge for 5 min at room temperature.\n  \n5. Discard the supernatant and resuspend cell pellets by vortexing in this volume of sterile TE or H<sub>2</sub>O:\n  Small Scale: 25-50 ml\nLibrary Scale: 500 ml\n  \n6. Pool cells in 50 ml tube and centrifuge at 1500 rpm in floor centrifuge for 5 min at room temperature.\n  \n7. Decant the supernatant.\n  \n8. Resuspend the cell pellet in this volume of freshly prepared, sterile 1xTE/LiAc:\n  Small Scale: 1.5 ml\nLibrary Scale: 8 ml\n  \n\\(NOTE: Cells must be used within about an hour after preparation.)\n9. Prepare PEG/LiAc solution, and this solution will be used in step #12:\n  Small Scale: 10ml\nLibrary Scale: 100ml\n       \n10. Add the following to each tube and mix:\n  Small scale \\(in 1.5 ml eppt tube) \nLibrary scale \\(in 500 ml centrifuge tube)\n        \nBait vector- 0.2 ug \\(small), 0.6 mg \\(library)\nLibrary vector- 0.1 ug \\(small), 0.3 mg \\(library)",
    "Herring testes carrier DNA- 0.1 mg \\(small), 20 mg \\(library)\n\\(For simultaneous cotransfection, a molar ratio of 2:1 \\(Bait vector: Prey vector) is recommended). \\(Just prior to use, denature the carrier DNA by placing it in a boiling water for 20 min and immediately cooling it on ice)\n11. Add this volume of yeast competent cells to each tube and mix well by vortexing:\n  Small Scale: 0.1 ml\nLibrary Scale: 8 ml\n         \n12. Add sterile PEG/LiAc solution \\(made in step #9) to each tube and vortex at high speed to mix:\n  Small Scale: 0.6 ml\nLibrary Scale: 60 ml\n13.  Incubate at 30 <sup>o</sup>C for 30 min with shaking \\(200 rpm).\n  \n14.  Add this volume of DMSO:\n  Small Scale: 70 ul\nLibrary Scale: 7 ml\nMix well by gentle inversion or swirling. Do not Vortex.\n15.  Heat shock for 15 min in a 42 <sup>o</sup>C water bath. Swirl occasionally to mix \\(large- and library-scale only)\n  \n16.  Chill cells on ice for 1-2 min.\n  \n17. Centrifuge cells for:  \n  Small Scale: 5 sec., room temperature - 14K rpm\nLibrary Scale: 5 min., room temperature - 1500 rpm\n18.  Remove the supernatant. \n  \n19. Resuspend cells in this volume of 1 x TE:\n  Small Scale: 0.5 ml\nLibrary Scale: 10 ml\n20. Plating:\n   For Small-scale cotransformation: spread 200 ul per 100-mm SD-Ura-His-Trp.\n For large- and library-scale transformation:\n--- Spread 100 ul of a 1:1,000, 1:100, and 1:10 dilution on SD-Ura-His-Trp plates \\(100 mm) for cotransformation efficiency controls.\n--- Spread 1 ul \\(diluted in 100 ul of H<sub>2</sub>O) on SD-His-Ura and SD-Trp-Ura plates \\(100 mm) to check the transformation efficiency of each plasmid. \n--- Spread the remaining transformation suspension on SD-Ura-His-Trp plates \\(200 ul per 150-mm Plates)\n Incubate the plates at 30 <sup>o</sup>C for 3-5 days.\n21. Calculating cotransformation efficiency and number of clones amplified:",
    "A.      Cotransformation efficiency:  count the colonies \\(cfu) growing on the SD-His-Trp-Ura dilution plate that has 30-300 cfu.\n     \ncfu/ug DNA = \\(Cfu x total suspension vol. \\(ul)) / \n             \\(\\(Vol. Plated \\(ul)) x \\(dilution factor) x \\(amount.DNA used\\(ug)\\(Limiting plasmid)))\nB. The number of clones amplified:\ncfu/ug x amt. Of library plasmid used \\(cfu/ug) = # of clones amplified. \n*************************************************************************************************************************"
