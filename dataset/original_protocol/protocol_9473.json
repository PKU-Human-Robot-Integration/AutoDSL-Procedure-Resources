    "Ethics Statement: Mice were purchased from an independent, non-profit biomedical research institution and housed in the Division of Laboratory Animal Resources at the University of Pittsburgh. All animal protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Pittsburgh.\n1. Protein Extraction and Generation of Peptides for Chemical-tagging\nExtract protein from tissue, cells, or bodily fluids.\nHomogenize 60-90 mg of tissue (e.g. brain, heart, and liver) in phosphate buffer saline (1x PBS) with 8 M urea (500 µL) using a mechanical homogenizer. Protease or phosphatase inhibitors may be added to the buffer if necessary. In this project, they were not used. Use the following parameters for the homogenizer: lysing matrix A beads, 4 m/s, 20 s. Heart tissue may require up to 9 cycles of homogenization.\n\t\tNOTE: Protease or phosphatase inhibitors may be added to the buffer if necessary. They were not used in this study.\n\t\t\nRemove tissue homogenate from the lysing tube and transfer to a micro-centrifuge tube. Rinse lysing tubes with 100-500 µL of PBS with 8 M urea and combine the rinse solution with tissue homogenate.\nCentrifuge the homogenized tissues (9,447 x g, 4 °C, 15 min) and collect the supernatant.\nDetermine the protein concentration using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay according to manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: Further dilution with buffer may be necessary if the protein concentration is too high. The resulting concentrations for samples from these tissues were in between 6-13 µg/µL.\n\t\nOptional: Add an internal quality control standard (e.g. bovine alpha casein or other exogenous protein) with the ratio 1 µg standard:100 µg protein sample.\n2. Sample Digestion\nAdd 100 µg (100 x 10-6 g) of protein from each sample to individually labeled micro-centrifuge tubes. The volume is dependent on the protein concentration (see step 1.2).",
    "Add dithiothreitol (DTT) (40:1 reagent to sample mol ratio) to each sample. Incubate at 37 °C for 2 h. The calculation for the molar ratio is based off the protein mass of bovine serum albumin (BSA), which is 66.5 x 103 g/mol.\nAdd iodoacetamide (IAM) (80:1 reagent to sample mol ratio) to each sample. Incubate on ice in the dark for 2 h. This reaction is performed on ice for 2 h to prevent side reactions.\nAdd L-cysteine (40:1 reagent to sample mol ratio) to each sample. Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nAdd 20 mM Tris buffer with 10 mM CaCl2 (pH 8.2) to dilute urea to a final concentration of 2 M.\nAdd L-1-tosylamido-2 phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (50:1 substrate to enzyme mol ratio) to each sample and incubate at 37 °C for 24 h.\nQuench the protein digestion by flash-freezing the sample in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C until further processing.\n3. Sample Desalting\nRe-acidify the samples by adding formic acid (FA). Add enough FA to obtain a final concentration of 0.1%. If samples are originally at -80 °C, thaw samples on ice before re-acidification.\nDe-salt the peptides using C18 hydrophilic lipophilic balanced (HLB) 10 mg cartridges as previously described16.\nDry the samples by vacuum centrifugation (5 Torr, 45 °C, 77 x g) to a volume of ~10 µL.\n4. Dimethylation Labeling (N-termini)\nReconstitute peptides in 1% acetic acid (0.25 µg/µL) dissolved in high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or nano-pure grade water. Remove a 50 µg portion to a new micro-centrifuge tube (1.5 mL) and store the remainder at -80 °C.",
    "Add 8 µL of 60 mM (4%) CH2O (37% wt/v) or 60 mM (4%) 13CD2O (20% wt/v) to the samples for labeling with light or heavy dimethylation, respectively. Typically, 4 µL of reagent is added per 25 µg of peptides (Steps 4.2, 4.3, 4.6).\nAdd 8 µL of 24 mM NaBH3CN or 24 mM NaBD3CN to the samples labeled with light or heavy dimethylation, respectively.\nVortex and shake on a tube shaker for ~10 min at room temperature.\nQuench the reactions by adding 16 µL of 1% ammonia (~28-30% v/v) for 5 min. Typically, 8 µL of reagent is added per 25 µg of peptides.\nRe-acidify the reaction mixtures by adding 8 µL of 5% FA (98% v/v).\nCombine the light and heavy dimethylated peptides (Figure 1) to generate a total of six samples. See Table 1 for a description of sample tagging and pooling used for this study.\nPerform sample desalting according to steps 3.2 and 3.3.\n5. Isobaric Tagging (Lys residues)\nReconstitute 100 µg of dimethylated peptides (1 µg/µL) in 100 mM tri-ethyl ammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) buffer (pH ~8.5).\nPrepare isobaric reagents as stated in the manufacturer's protocol (see Table of Materials/Reagents).\nAdd solubilized isobaric reagents (41 µL) to peptides and vortex for ~10 s. Shake the samples on a micro-centrifuge tube shaker for ~1 h. Quench the reactions with 8 µL hydroxylamine (10% w/v) and incubate the samples for 15 min at room temperature.\nPool the six labeled samples into a single mixture and desalt (Steps 3.1-3.3) or store at -80 °C until further use.\n\tNOTE: For improving proteome coverage and depth, a multi-dimensional separation strategy is suggested such as strong cation exchange (SCX).\n6. Strong Cation Exchange\nPerform SCX as per the manufacturer's protocol (see Materials Table).",
    "Prepare ~1 mL of ammonium formate solutions (20 mM, 40 mM, 60 mM, 80 mM, 100 mM, 150 mM, 250 mM, & 500 mM) with 10% acetonitrile (ACN), 0.1% FA (pH 3).\nRemove the red cap from the top of the pipette tip and tap the pipette tip with packing slurry to ensure that the packing material is towards the bottom of the pipette tip.\n\t\tNOTE: Critical: Do not throw away the pipette tip until the end of the protocol.\nPlace the centrifuge adapter onto the top of a micro-centrifuge tube (2 mL) and secure the pipette tip inside.\nAdd 150 µL of SCX reconstitution buffer to pipette tips.\nCentrifuge the pipette tips for 6 min at room temperature (4,000 x g). Repeat this step two more times and discard the waste.\nDissolve the peptides in 150 µL of SCX reconstitution buffer. Ensure that the pH is 3.\nAdd peptides to the pipette tips, centrifuge (see 6.1.5), and keep the eluent.\nTransfer the filter and pipette to a new micro-centrifuge tube (2 mL) and add 150 µL of 20 mM ammonium formate solution. Centrifuge for 6 min at room temperature (4,000 x g) and keep the eluent.\nRepeat step 6.1.8 an additional seven times, using successive concentrations (i.e. 40 mM, 60 mM, 80 mM, 100 mM, 150 mM, 250 mM and 500 mM) of ammonium formate.\nTransfer the eight SCX fractions to micro-centrifuge tubes (1.5 mL) and concentrate them by using centrifugal evaporation (see step 3.3).\n7. Liquid Chromatography–Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and MS3\nReconstitute the peptides in mass spectrometry grade water with 0.1% FA, filter, and place into an auto-sampler vial. Filter peptides as follows:\n\t\nAdd reconstituted peptides to a micro-centrifuge tube containing a 0.65 µm filter (see Materials Table).",
    "Centrifuge peptides at 12,000 x g for 1 min. Remove filter, discard, and add filtered peptides into an auto-sampler vial.\nPrepare the mobile phase buffers as follows: 3% (v/v) ACN with 0.1% FA (A) and 100% ACN with 0.1% FA (B).\nInject 6 µL of each SCX fraction sample onto a trap column packed to 2 cm with C18 material (5 µm, 200 Å pore size).\n\tNOTE: Sample cleaning on the trap is as follows: 3 min, 0% B; 3 µL/min using a 2D liquid chromatography system (see Materials Table).\nRun the analytical separation method. Use a 75 µm i.d. x 13.2 cm laser pulled-tip fused silica capillary column packed with C18 material (5 µm, 100 Å). The gradient is: 0-5 min, 10% B; 5-40 min, 10-15% B; 40-90 min, 15-25% B; 90-115 min, 25-30% B; 115-130 min, 30-60% B; 130-135 min, 60-80% B; 135-145 min, 80% B, 145-150 min, 80-10% B; 150-180 min, 10% B; 300 nL/min, 180 min.\nRun the data acquisition for the mass spectrometer while the analytical separation method is running.\n\tNOTE: The parameters for the MS survey scan are as follows: 400-1,600 m/z, 60,000 resolution, automatic gain control (AGC) target 1 x 106 ions, maximum injection time 500 ms. Parameters for CID–MS/MS are as follows: Top 1-7 or Top 8-14 data dependent acquisition (DDA), 3 m/z isolation width, 500 minimum signal, 35% normalized collision energy (NCE), 0.25 activation q, 10 ms activation time, 3 x 104 AGC, 50 ms maximum injection time. Parameters for HCD–MS3 are as follows: 200 minimum signal, 4 m/z isolation width, 60% NCE, 0.1 activation time, 3 x 105 AGC, 250 ms IT, 300-1,300 m/z MS/MS selection range, exclude un-fragmented parent ion.\nPerform each analysis in duplicate for both the top 1-7 and top 8-14 runs.",
    "NOTE: For samples run on a newer model of an instrument containing an orbitrap or a tribrid mass spectrometer, DDA parameters will vary and can be optimized to include more MS/MS and MS3 scans. Additionally, for tribrid instruments, synchronous precursor selection (SPS)-MS3 should be employed.\n8. Data Analysis16\nSearch the RAW files using protein analysis software against an appropriate database, such as mouse Uniprot.\n\tNOTE: It is important to create two workflows for each RAW file in order to search for light and heavy dimethylated peptides.\nSearch the RAW files using the following parameters: trypsin with two missed cleavages, peptide mass range 300-6,000 Da, 15 ppm parent mass tolerance, 1 Da fragmentation tolerance. Static modifications: light dimethylation (+28.031, peptide N-terminus) or heavy dimethylation (+36.076 Da, peptide N-terminus), carbamidomethyl (+57.021 Da, C).\n\tNOTE: Sometimes the heavy dimethylated peak is ~7 Da (+35.069 Da, peptide N-terminus) is from the light dimethylated peak and thus should be incorporated into the search workflow for heavy dimethylated peptides. Dynamic modifications: oxidation (+15.995 Da, M), 6-plex isobaric tag (229.163 Da, K). Include a decoy database search to yield false discovery rates (e.g. 1 and 5%) and a quantitation node to search for the reporter ion intensities of isobaric tags.\nStatistics\n\t\nExport data into an electronic spreadsheet program in order to normalize protein reporter ion values. For each protein, divide either the median reporter ion ratios or raw reporter ion intensities by the median ratio of the internal standard or raw reporter ion intensities of the internal standard, respectively. Use the appropriate statistical software such as an electronic spreadsheet program, Perseus, or R to determine significant changes among sample conditions.\nSubscription Required.
