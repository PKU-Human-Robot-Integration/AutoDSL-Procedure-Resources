    "Morphological changes to the cellular architecture are the most striking features of apoptosis and necrosis (Figs. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-fig-0001]-5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-fig-0005]). Membrane blebbing and cell shrinkage (associated with apoptosis) or membrane swelling and ballooning (associated with necrosis) can easily be detected by observing cells with a phase-contrast microscope (Figs. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-fig-0006] and 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-fig-0007]). Stimuli that initiate apoptosis will typically take 8-20 hr to provoke the latter changes in cells, whereas stimuli that provoke necrosis often elicit morphological alterations to cells within 2-3 hr. Quantification of cell death can be done directly from the culture dish without any processing of the sample. As a result, microscopy is probably the simplest and most accurate method to assess cell death and to discriminate between live, apoptotic, and necrotic cells. However, this approach does require knowledge of the distinct features displayed by apoptotic versus necrotic cells and involves manual cell counting, which can be time consuming. That said, this is the preferred method for rapidly and accurately quantifying apoptosis and necrosis in many laboratories, including our own. Numerous cytotoxic drugs and other stimuli can induce apoptosis, and it is useful to include a well-known pro-apoptotic agent as a positive control (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-tbl-0001]), as the specific morphological features of apoptosis can vary between cell types. Because necrosis is largely a physical process due to plasma membrane rupture, followed by high-amplitude cellular and organelle swelling, the features of necrotic cells tend to be broadly similar even among diverse cell types (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-fig-0007]).\nTable 1.\n                Stimuli That Initiate Apoptosis in Many Cell Types\ntable:\n﻿Pro-apoptotic compound,Mechanism(s) of action,Concentration range,Source\nTRAIL ligand,\"Activator of death receptor pathway (TRAIL receptors 1/2, DR4/5)\",10-200 ng/ml,Adipogen: Superkiller TRAIL AG-40T-0002-C020\nFas ligand,Activator of death receptor pathway (Fas/CD95 receptor),50-200 ng/ml,\"Merck: anti-Fas antibody (human, activating), clone CH11\"\nCisplatin,Inducer of DNA damage by DNA crosslinking,10-200 μM,Merck: cisplatin PHR1624",

Avoid any unnecessary disturbance of the dish before and during analysis as detached cells tend to settle in the center of the tissue culture vessel upon disturbance.\n2.

    "It can be useful to take photographs of representative fields of view to capture the morphological appearance of the cells and to represent the relative live versus dead cell composition of the culture (Figs. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-fig-0006] and 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-fig-0007]).",

This can be achieved by eosin and methylene blue staining of cytospun and fixed cell preparations. The cell cytoplasm is stained purple/blue and the nucleus becomes pink after eosin and methylene blue staining. This method is more involved than direct cell counting from tissue culture but allows a more detailed inspection of nuclear morphology; and, because cells are fixed and mounted, slides can be stored and re-counted at a later date.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5b9199f0-15f0-4eed-9b25-f8e0c523dd5a/cpz1951-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nPhase-contrast microscopy analysis of eosin-/methylene blue-stained cytospins.

    "The condensation and fragmentation of nuclei that occurs during apoptosis can easily be detected with fluorescent DNA-binding dyes such as Hoechst 33342 or propidium iodide (PI). This protocol describes the use of the cell-permeable dye Hoechst 33342 to stain fixed cells that have been grown on coverslips. Hoechst 33342 can be excited with a UV laser or a xenon or a mercury lamp of a fluorescence microscope and emits blue fluorescence. Cells stained in this way can then be counted, with apoptotic nuclei displaying characteristic hypercondensation and fragmentation into distinct globules (Fig. 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-fig-0009]). In contrast, necrotic, necroptotic, or ferroptotic cells display a swollen, decondensed morphology that is very distinct from the features exhibited by apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-fig-0007]). Hoechst 33342 can also be used to stain live as well as dead cells directly in the culture dish.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4e1a5581-2d4f-4ef2-a987-febd6c6f7f30/cpz1951-fig-0009-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 9\nAnalysis of nuclear morphology by phase-contrast microscopy.

    "Adherent cells can be grown on sterilized coverslips. Some suspension cells can also be grown on sterilized coverslips precoated with 10 μg/ml poly-D-lysine for 30 min and then air-dried. Cleaning the coverslips with a solution containing 1% HCl might be required before use.\nCytospins can alternatively be used.\nCells can also be stained directly in the tissue culture dish without fixation. In this situation, incubate cells with 2 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (added to the tissue culture medium from a 100× stock) for 20 min at 37°C and visualize cells under a UV microscope.\nUse untreated cells as a negative control and cells treated with a stimulus that is well established to induce apoptosis (see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-tbl-0001]) as a positive control.\n2.

    "Cytocentrifugation is a very useful method of adhering cells to slides (cytospins) for staining as well as for long-term storage. In this protocol, cells are spun at low speed onto glass slides while the liquid from the cell suspension is absorbed by a filter paper. After cytocentrifugation, cells should appear as a flat monolayer on the microscope slide.

    "The annexin V binding assay is one of the most sensitive and widely used techniques to detect and distinguish between early and late apoptosis, as well as between apoptosis and necrosis. However, it is important to emphasize that annexin V staining does not discriminate between apoptotic and necrotic cells when plasma membrane permeabilization has occurred. In this assay, FITC-conjugated annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine (PS), a phospholipid normally maintained on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane that is rapidly externalized on the plasma membrane of apoptotic cells. Because plasma membrane integrity is maintained in the early stages of apoptosis, the use of a vital dye such as propidium iodide (PI) enables discrimination between live cells (annexin V-negative and PI-negative), early apoptotic cells (annexin V-positive and PI-negative), and late apoptotic or necrotic cells (annexin V-positive and PI-positive; Fig. 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-fig-0010]).

Pellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 400 × g, room temperature.\nCells should not be fixed before staining with annexin V as fixation agents will permeabilize the cells and permit the PS localized on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane to bind the annexin V, thus generating false positives.

Resuspend the cell pellets with 300 μl of 1 μg/ml annexin V-FITC staining solution.\nBecause annexin V binds to PS in a Ca2+-dependent manner, the presence of Ca2+ ions in the annexin V binding buffer is essential at all times. Ca2+ ions should be present at concentrations between 1 and 3 mM. Higher concentrations of Ca2+ are not recommended and can promote nonspecific binding of the protein to other phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine.\n4. Incubate 15 min at room temperature.\n5.

    "Intranucleosomal DNA fragmentation is a major hallmark of apoptosis, whereas necrotic cells exhibit little DNA fragmentation by comparison. Activation of caspase-activated endonucleases (CAD) during apoptosis results in the generation of low-molecular-weight (∼200 bp multiples) DNA fragments. In this protocol, the small DNA fragments of apoptotic cells are passively released with a phosphate-citrate buffer after fixation/permeabilization of the cells with ethanol. As a result, apoptotic cells display a markedly reduced DNA content (i.e., apoptotic cells appear below the typical 2N DNA peak observed for the majority of viable cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle) upon analysis by flow cytometry. This can readily be measured by flow cytometry after staining with the DNA-intercalating dye propidium iodide (PI), which binds stoichiometrically to nucleic acids, resulting in a red fluorescence emission proportional to the DNA content of the cell. Using this assay method, apoptotic cells appear below the G1 peak on the DNA histogram and are therefore called sub-G1 (Fig. 11[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-fig-0011]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8cc09c46-4ea7-4d77-b9c4-d0e66191c9ee/cpz1951-fig-0011-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 11\nMeasurement of the sub-G1 population by flow cytometry.

    "Although detection of the sub-G1 cell population is a relatively easy way to determine whether cells have undergone apoptosis, this technique is usually considered a semi-qualitative method for apoptosis detection. This protocol provides an alternate method allowing the quantitative detection of cells displaying DNA fragmentation. The TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling) assay is more complex and significantly more expensive than the sub-G1 assay. In this protocol, cleaved ends of genomic DNA are labeled with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) enzyme. BrdU-labeled DNA breaks are subsequently detected with a FITC-conjugated anti-BrdU antibody. Here, BrdU is preferred to the traditional dUTP-biotin because it is more sensitive, cheaper, and easier to use.\nUnlike the sub-G1 assay, the TUNEL assay requires a cross-linking step to prevent the release of cleaved DNA fragments. This is achieved with the use of the cross-linking fixative paraformaldehyde. BrdU-labeled cells can be quantitatively measured by flow cytometry. Alternatively, TUNEL staining can be performed on cells grown on coverslips for fluorescence microscopy analysis. In this case, counterstaining of the nuclei with propidium iodide or Hoechst 33342 can be performed to facilitate counting of TUNEL-positive nuclei.\nMaterials\nSingle-cell suspension or cells grown on coverslips (no. 1.5 thickness)\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\n3.5% (w/v) paraformaldehyde (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-rec-0008])\n0.15% (v/v) Triton X-100 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-rec-0014])\nTdT equilibration buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-rec-0012])\nTdT reaction solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-rec-0013])\nFITC-conjugated anti-BrdU staining solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-rec-0004])\nCentrifuge\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes\nIce\n37°C incubator\nFlow cytometer with a 488-nm argon-ion laser\nCell fixation and permeabilization\n1.

    "Several members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases, particularly caspase-3 and caspase-7, play key roles in the phenotypic changes to the cell that occur during apoptosis (Figs. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-fig-0001] and 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-fig-0003]). In contrast, caspase are not typically activated during passive necrosis, ferroptosis, or necroptosis. Indeed, necroptosis is typically observed upon engagement of death receptors, such as TNFR, when caspase activity is inhibited. Activation of other caspases (i.e., caspase-1, -4, and -5) is, however, associated with pyroptosis (a programmed mode of necrosis that is typically associated with caspase-1-mediated activation of the pore-forming gasdermin D protein), and pyroptotic cells are best discriminated from apoptotic cells on the basis of morphological criteria (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-prot-0001]). Therefore, measuring caspase activity is an easy way to discriminate between apoptosis and most forms of necrosis, with the exception of pyroptosis. This can be achieved with the use of FAM-VAD-FMK, a cell-permeable caspase substrate. The tripeptide VAD, which is able to bind the active site of all caspase family members, is coupled to a fluoromethylketone (FMK) moiety, which is responsible for the covalent binding of the probe to the active site of catalytically active caspases. This inhibitor is conjugated with a green fluorescent carboxyfluorescein moiety (FAM); therefore, cells with active caspases will stain green, whereas cells with inactive caspases will remain unstained. In this protocol, cells are also counterstained with propidium iodide (PI) to allow discrimination between viable and dead cells by flow cytometry. However, as an alternative, cells can be fixed for UV or confocal microscopy analysis.\nMaterials\nSingle-cell suspension\nCell culture medium appropriate for the cells of interest\n300 μM FAM-VAD-FMK FLICA reagent (e.g., Molecular Probes or ImmunoChemistry Technologies) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)\n1 mg/ml propidium iodide (PI) stock solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-rec-0011])\nCentrifuge\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes\n37°C incubator",

    "Because caspases play a key role in apoptosis, the effects of broad-spectrum caspase inhibitors (such as zVAD-FMK, Emricisan, or qVD-OPh) can be used to determine whether a specific agent is promoting apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, or ferroptosis. Whereas caspase inhibitors typically inhibit apoptosis, or radically alter the morphological features of cells undergoing apoptosis, such inhibitors typically have little effect on conventional necrosis or ferroptosis and can even enhance or accelerate necroptosis.\nNecroptosis is a mode of programmed necrosis that is typically only observed when caspases are inhibited and can be suppressed using a RIP kinase 1 inhibitor called necrostatin. Ferroptosis is a mode of programmed necrosis typically seen in response to agents that promote extensive lipid peroxidation and is normally suppressed by the lipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4). Ferroptosis can be discriminated from apoptosis, necrosis, and necroptosis through use of the radical-trapping antioxidants ferrostatin-1 or liproxstatin-1, which block this mode of cell death. Thus, assessing the effects of poly-caspase inhibitors, necrostatin, ferrostatin-1, and liproxstatin-1 on the morphology and kinetics of cell death induced by a specific stimulus is a relatively straightforward way to discriminate between apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis.\nMaterials\nCells of interest\nCytotoxic agent under investigation\nzVAD-FMK (or alternative poly-caspase inhibitor; Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-tbl-0002])\nNecroptotic inhibitor (Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-tbl-0002])\nFerroptotic inhibitor (Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.951#cpz1951-tbl-0002])\nPositive control pro-apoptotic agent (optional)\nTable 2.\n                Inhibitors of Apoptosis, Necroptosis, and Ferroptosis\ntable:\n﻿Inhibitors,Mechanism(s) of action,Concentration range,Source\nApoptotic Inhibitors,Apoptotic Inhibitors,Apoptotic Inhibitors,Apoptotic Inhibitors\nZ-VAD-FMK,Poly-caspase inhibitor,5-20 μM,\"Bachem: Z-Val-Ala-DL-Asp-fluoromethylketone, 4026865\"\nQ-VD-OPh,Poly-caspase inhibitor,5-20 μM,\"ApexBio: Q-VD-OPh, A1901\"\nEmricasan,\"Poly-caspase inhibitor, caspase 8 inhibitor\",1-10 μM,\"Merck: emricasan, SML2227\"\nNecroptotic Inhibitors,Necroptotic Inhibitors,Necroptotic Inhibitors,Necroptotic Inhibitors\nNecrostatin-1 (Nec-1),Inhibitor of RIPK1,10-100 μM,\"Merck: necrostatin-1, N9037\"\nNecrostatin-1 Stable (Nec-1s),Specific inhibitor of RIPK1,10-100 μM,\"Selleck: necrostatin 2 racemate (Nec-1s), S8641\"\nNecrosulfonamide,Binds to MLKL,1-20 μM,\"Selleck: necrosulfonamide, S8251\"\nFerroptotic Inhibitors,Ferroptotic Inhibitors,Ferroptotic Inhibitors,Ferroptotic Inhibitors\nFerrostatin,Lipid ROS scavenger,1-20 μM,\"Merck: ferrostatin, SML0583\"",
