    "1. Day 1\n1) Plate cells\nPlate hMSC in a T75 flask at a confluency of 80% at least 18-24 hours prior to labeling. Refer to Table 1 for instruction for alternate vessels.\n2. Day 2\n2) Prepare labeling solution. This preparation will label one (1) T75 flask at 80% confluency with a concentration of 400 μg Fe/ml. Refer to Table 1 for instruction for alternate vessels.\nCreate a solution (solution 1) by mixing 1 ml of serum-free media and 93.1 μl of ferumoxytol (stock: 30 mg/ml) in a 15 ml conical tube.\nCreate a second solution (solution 2) by mixing 1 ml of serum-free media and 7 μl of protamine sulfate (stock: 10 mg/ml) in a second 15 ml conical tube.\nAllow each solution to rest for 5 minutes.\nAdd solutions 1 and 2 together. Gently mix the new labeling solution. Allow the solution to rest for 5 minutes to permit USPIO-protamine sulfate complexes to form.\nAdd 5 ml of serum-free media to the mixed 2 ml of SPIO/protamine sulfate solution for a final volume of 7 ml.\n3) Prepare cells for labeling\nAspirate the media from cells.\nGently wash cells once with 2-3 ml of pre-warmed Mg/Ca-free D-PBS or serum-free media to rinse away residual serum proteins and or other media components that could impair contrast agent uptake and labeling efficiency. Aspirate out the rinse fluid.\n4) Label cells\nAdd the complete 7 ml of labeling solution to cells.\nPlace cells into an incubator (37°C/ 5% CO2) and allow the cells to incubate in the labeling solution for 4 hours.",
    "Add 700 μl of FCS to the labeling solution of the cells to achieve a final serum concentration of 10%. Serum is added to re-establish the enriched environment of which the cells are accustomed, and to assist in minimizing cell death that could result from an abrupt shift to 24 hour exposure to a serum-free environment.\nAllow the cells to incubate with the labeling solution for an additional 20 hours.\n3. Day 3\n5) Prepare labeled cells\nAspirate the labeling solution from cells.\nGently rinse cells with 2-3 ml of pre-warmed Mg/Ca-free D-PBS. Aspirate out the PBS. It is important to use Mg/Ca-free PBS as the Mg and Ca will impair the efficiency of Trypsin in the next step.\nAdd 2 ml of pre-warmed 0.05% Trypsin to the cells and tilt the flask back and forth to ensure the entire surface of the flask is covered with a thin layer of Trypsin. Place the cells in an incubator (37°C/ 5% CO2) and allow the cells to rest for 5-7 minutes or until cells begin to detach from the plate. It may be necessary to confirm detachment under a microscope. Gently tap the sides of the flask if necessary to facilitate cell-surface detachment.\nAdd 4 ml of pre-warmed complete media to the flask to neutralize the Trypsin. Gently rinse the flask by pipetting the Trypsin/media/cell solution up and down several times. Collect the entire solution in a 15 ml conical tube. Centrifuge the cell solution at 400 RCF for 5 minutes.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet. Resuspend the cells in 5 ml of media (serum containing or serum-free). Centrifuge the cell solution at 400 RCF for 5 minutes.",
    "Repeat the cell wash described in step 5.5. In total, cells will be rinsed three times to remove residual, free contrast agent in media and on the surface of cells.\nCount cells at this point to attain the most accurate cell count, as cells will be lost during previous washing. Perform a viability test of cells. Cells are now ready for subsequent analysis and or experimental application. MR imaging can be performed with T1-w and T2-w parameters, because although ferumoxytol is a T2-w contrast agent, ferumoxytol also exhibits T1 effects. Representative T2-w MRI parameters that can be used to image ferumoxytol labeled cells include: FSE or SE_Multislice sequences with a TR of 2000-2500 ms and a TE of 60-80 ms. To acquire a T1-w image, decrease the TE value on a FSE or SE_Multislice sequence or use a GRE sequence with a high TR and low TE. Figure 4 demonstrates a potential in vivo application for labeled stem cell imaging.\n4. Representative Results:\nLabeled cells demonstrate a significant darkening or negative contrast effect on T2-weighted MR images and a brightening or positive contrast effect on T1-weighted MR images (Figure 2). Longitudinal MR imaging and viability tests performed 5 days post labeling demonstrated no significant MR signal and no significant impact on viability compared to unlabeled controls (data not shown).\nLabeled stem cells can subsequently be differentiated into various cell types or intravenously injected for in vivo investigation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3482/3482fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
