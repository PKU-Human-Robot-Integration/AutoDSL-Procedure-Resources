    "Note: When the cells are centrifuged, use swing rotors.   Cell culture  Culture cells to 70%–80% confluency with 5 mL of medium in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C. The media and flask used for each cell line in our experiments are described below.Medium and flasks:table:\n﻿0,1,2\nCell type,Media,Flask\nC2C12,\"DMEM, high glucose, GlutaMAX supplement with 10% FBS\",Falcon T25 flask\nHeLa S3,Falcon T25 flask,\nHEK293,Falcon T25 flask,\nHEK293T,Falcon T25 flask,\nA375,Falcon T25 flask,\nH2009,Falcon T25 flask,\nH2122,RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS,Primaria T25 flask\nH1944,Falcon T25 flask,\nH441,Falcon T25 flask,",
    "Aspirate the medium from the flask and add 3 mL of PBS slowly.Aspirate PBS from the flask and add 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA.Incubate the cells in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 5 min at 37°C.Add 5 mL of the medium described in the table above and detach cells from the flask by pipetting.Transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL tube.Centrifuge the cells at 800  × g  for 3 min at 25°C.Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 5 mL of the medium described in the table above.Count the cell number by CellDrop. Note: The cell suspension should be at 0.5  ×  106 –2  ×  106 cells/mL.  Dilute the cell suspension to 2 × 105 cells/mL with the medium described in the table above.Seed 10 mL of cell suspension (2 × 105 cells/mL) in a 10 cm dish. Note: The following cultures should be prepared: one culture for the tested sample and another for the negative control for FACS analysis.  Incubate the cells in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 overnight at 37°C. HPG labeling  For the sample, aspirate the medium from one of the 10 cm dishes and add 10 mL of Met-free DMEM (see Recipes).Aspirate the medium and add 10 mL of Met-free DMEM with anisomycin and HPG (see Recipes) to the 10 cm dish. For the negative control, use DMEM with anisomycin (see Recipes). Note: Anisomycin is used to shut off cytosolic protein synthesis.  Incubate the 10 cm dish in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 3 h at 37°C. Fixation and permeabilization  Aspirate the medium from the 10 cm dish and add 10 mL of PBS.Aspirate the PBS and add 1.5 mL of trypsin-EDTA.Incubate the cells in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 5 min at 37°C.",
    "Transfer the cell suspension to a 2 mL tube.Centrifuge at 300  × g  for 3 min at 25°C.Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 0.5 mL of cold PBS.Centrifuge the cells at 300  × g  for 3 min at 25°C.Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 0.5 mL of mitochondria-protective buffer with 0.0005% digitonin (see Recipes) at room temperature.Incubate the cells for 5 min at 25°C.Centrifuge the cells at 300  × g  for 3 min at 25°C.Discard the supernatant with a pipette and resuspend the cell pellet with 0.5 mL of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate buffer solution on ice.Incubate the cells for 15 min on ice.Centrifuge the cells at 300  × g  for 3 min at 25°C.Discard the supernatant with a pipette and resuspend the cell pellet with 0.5 mL of PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (see Recipes) at room temperature.Incubate the cells for 5 min at 25°C.Centrifuge the cells at 1,000  × g  for 3 min at 25°C.Discard the supernatant and proceed to the “Click reaction” immediately. Click reaction  Resuspend the cell pellet with 250 µL of click-reaction mixture (see Recipes) at room temperature.Incubate the cells for 30 min at 25°C.Centrifuge at 1,000  × g  for 3 min at 25°C.Discard the supernatant with a pipette and proceed to the “Tom20 immunostaining” immediately. Tom20 immunostaining  Resuspend the cell pellet with 0.5 mL of intercept (TBS) blocking buffer at room temperature.Centrifuge at 1,000  × g  for 3 min at 25°C.Discard the supernatant with a pipette and resuspend the cell pellet with 100 µL of ice-cold intercept (TBS) blocking buffer with Alexa-Fluor 647 Anti-Tom20 antibody (see Recipes) on ice. Note: For negative control of Tom20 immunostaining, use ice-cold intercept (TBS) blocking buffer (omitting Alexa-Fluor 647 Anti-Tom20 antibody).  Incubate the cells for 1 h on ice.",
    "Centrifuge at 1,000  × g  for 3 min at 2°C.Discard the supernatant with a pipette and resuspend the cell pellet in 0.5 mL of cold PBS.Repeat steps E41–42 twice (for a total of three washes).Resuspend the cell pellet in 0.5 mL of cold FACS buffer (see Recipes).Proceed to “FACS preparation and analysis” immediately. FACS preparation and analysis  Filter the cell suspension with a cell strainer and collect the cells in a 5 mL round-bottom polystyrene test tube.Transfer the cells that passed through the filter to a new 5 mL round-bottom polystyrene test tube and preserve in ice until measurement.Place the 5 mL round-bottom polystyrene test tube containing the negative control (neither HPG-Cy3 nor Tom20-AF647 labeling) on the BD FACSMelody and start the flow.Set appropriate photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltages for forward scatters (FSCs) and side scatters (SSCs) with BD FACSChorus so that the signal lies within the detectable range. Then, gate a cell population as “Gate: Cells” in BD FACSChorus.To discriminate doublets, set “Gate: Singlet” according to the values of FSC-A/FSC-H and FSC-H/FSC-W in FlowJo.Set the PMT voltages for HPG-Cy3 labeling [561 nm laser, PE filter set (582/15 filter and 582 LP mirror); alternatively, 488 nm laser, PE filter set (586/42 filter and 560 LP)] and Tom20-AF647 labeling [640 nm laser, APC filter set (660/10 filter and 660/10 mirror)] in BD FACSChorus so that the signal is shown in approximately 100.Replace the 5 mL round-bottom polystyrene test tube containing the sample with the one containing the negative control in BD FACSMelody and start the flow.Record the data up to 10,000 events in “Gate: Singlet” and then export all the data at least including FSC-A, SSC-A, PE-A, and APC-A as an FCS file."
