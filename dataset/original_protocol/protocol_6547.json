    "Reviving enteroids from liquid nitrogen storageThaw Matrigel aliquot overnight at 4 °C.Add 10 ml of LWRN- into a 15 ml conical tube and leave on ice.Transfer frozen vial containing enteroids from liquid nitrogen under running tap water at room temperature (a frozen vial usually contains about 150-200 enteroids).Transfer content into the 15 ml conical tube containing LWRN-.Spin down cells in a refrigerated centrifuge at 80 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Aspirate medium and suspend pellet in Matrigel (calculate the required volume of Matrigel based on the total number of wells that will be seeded with enteroids).Plate enteroids in 10 µl Matrigel drops in a 24-well plate, four drops per well (seed 3 wells of 4 drops from one cryovial of 500 µl).Allow the Matrigel to solidify in a 37 °C incubator for 10 min.Add 1 ml of LWRN+ medium to each well containing enteroids suspended in Matrigel.Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Replace medium every two days until enteroids are ready to be passaged after 6 to 7 days (Figure 1, left).Passaging and maintaining enteroids (procedure for 1-10 wells)Preparation: Keep pipette tips in refrigerator for about 30 min before start. Warm up the plates.Carefully aspirate medium from wells without disturbing Matrigel.Add 500 µl of cold LWRN- to each well and mechanically break up Matrigel by pipetting up and down 3-5 times with a P1000 pipette. Optimize the level of pipetting for each enteroid line.Using a 1 ml syringe with a 25G x 5/8″ needle, push broken Matrigel in and out 3-4 times per well, transfer the contents of the well into a 15 ml conical tube (cells will not be damaged by the needle; if there are multiple wells of the same enteroid line, combine up to 10 wells in the same tube).",
    "Add another 500 µl of cold LWRN- to each well and transfer the content into the 15 ml tube with the syringe. Add at least 5 ml total volume to 15 ml tube.Spin down cells in a refrigerated centrifuge at 80 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.Carefully remove and discard supernatant and keep enteroid pellet on ice.Suspend enteroid pellet in Matrigel on ice. Matrigel must be kept cold to avoid solidification.Using cold P20 pipette tips, plate enteroids in 10 µl Matrigel drops in a 24-well plate, four drops per well.Transfer plate into a 37 °C incubator and allow the Matrigel to set for 10 min.Add 500 µl of room temperature LWRN+ to each well and incubate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubatorReplace medium every two days until enteroids are ready to be passaged (usually after 6 or 7 days) (Figure 1, left).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200715/20200715114146_8469.jpgFigure 1. 3D and 2D human intestinal enteroids. Fetal ileum line were kept in LWRN+ culture media for 4 days (left; 3D) or seeded in 48-well plate and kept in differentiation media for 6 days (right; 2D)Making and maintaining 2D enteroid monolayers on Transwells and 48-well platesPrepare a collagen IV stock solution (1 mg/ml in 100 mM glacial acetic acid).Prepare 100 mM acetic acid by adding 60 µl of 100% acetic acid to 10 ml sterile water.Suspend 1 mg of collagen IV in 1 ml of 100 mM acetic acid to make collagen IV stock solution and vortex to mix.Aliquot in 500 µl and store at -20 °C.Prepare a 1:30 dilution of collagen IV stock solution in cold sterile water.Add 100 µl of the cold diluted collagen IV solution to each Transwell or 200 µl to each well in the 48-well plate and incubate at 37 °C for 2 h for the collagen to solidify.",
    "Take off the culture medium from well, and break enteroids apart by adding 500 µl/well of cold 0.5 mM EDTA wash solution (made by diluting 10 µl of 500 mM EDTA to 10 ml PBS-/-) and pipetting up and down 5 times.Transfer the enteroid solution into a sterile 15 ml tube.Add another 500 µl/well of cold 0.5 mM EDTA wash solution to each well and transfer into the 15 ml tube. Add at least 5 ml total volume to 15 ml tube.Spin at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells (if pellet is not compact, then re-spin).Carefully remove and discard supernatant using a 10 ml pipette. A small amount of residual liquid is okay.Re-suspend pellet in 500 µl 0.05% trypsin by pipetting up and down with P1000 (500 µl trypsin for 1-5 wells combined or 1 ml trypsin for 6-10 wells of enteroids).Incubate at 37 °C for 4-6 min (optimize the incubation time for each enteroid line).Inactivate trypsin by adding 1 ml of LWRN- medium containing 10% FBS.Dissociate the enteroids by vigorously pipetting up and down 40-50 times using P1000 pipette (optimize the specific number of times for each enteroid line; avoid forming bubbles by pipetting against the wall of the tube).Put a 40 µm cell strainer over a 50 ml conical tube.Pre-wet the strainer by passing 1 ml of LWRN- medium supplemented with 10% FBS.Add the cells onto the strainer and allow the cells to flow through by gravity.Rinse the strainer with additional 1 ml LWRN-.Pellet the cell suspension by centrifuging at 400 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.Remove and discard supernatant with a 10 ml pipette and carefully remove the remaining liquid with a P200 pipette without disturbing the pellet.",
    "Suspend the cell pellet in 100-1,000 µl LWRN+ medium containing 10 µM Y-27632. Take a small aliquot of the cells and count with hemocytometer.Remove the collagen coating solution from the Transwell or plate.Plate by adding 1 x 105 cells dropwise into the middle of the collagen-coated Transwell or plate (100 µl per Transwell or 200 µl per 48-well). The cells will spread out and coat the well so do not rotate or swirl the seeded plate.Add 600 µl of LWRN+ medium containing 10 μM Y-27632 in the lower compartment of the Transwell.The next day, remove the LWRN+ medium containing 10 μM Y-27632 and replace with LWRN+ medium only.Replace medium every two days until enteroids are ready to be infected (usually when cells are about 80-90% confluent).If there was a need to infect differentiated cells, add differentiation medium to the upper (100 µl) and lower (600 µl) compartments of Transwells or 200 µl to 48-well plate to differentiate 2D enteroids when the wells are 80-90% confluent.Replace differentiation medium every two days until enteroids are ready to be infected (usually after 3-7 days) (Figure 1, right).Human astrovirus infection of enteroid 2D monolayerThaw HAstV1, MLB1, VA1 and mock cell lysates plus HAstV5-positive stool filtrate at room temperature (expand HAstV1 and VA1 in Caco-2 cells; expand MLB1 in Huh7.5 cells; freeze and lyse infected cells to yield virus stock; filter HAstV5-psitive stool sample collected in AMES buffer through 0.22 µm; titer virus stock by RT-qPCR to determine the genome copies).Dilute MLB1 and VA1 as 105 genome copies per 100 µl of LWRN- medium only while HAstV1 and HAstV5 diluent should contain 5 µg/ml porcine trypsin.Incubate HAstV1 and HAstV5 in the trypsin solution above for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Rinse the enteroid monolayer once with cold LWRN- medium.",
    "Remove media and gently add 100 µl diluted virus.Incubate the infected cells for 1 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.Remove the inoculum and gently wash the monolayer once with LWRN- medium.Store a plate containing few wells with infected HIE at -80 °C as 0 h to measure the initial inoculum.Add 200 µl (100 µl in Transwell insert) LWRN+ or differentiation medium to the remaining wells (± 2 µg/ml porcine trypsin) and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 till harvest.Collect supernatant and cells separately during harvest.Store at -80 °C during harvest until analysis.Immunofluorescent staining of astrovirus-infected 2D enteroid monolayers on TranswellsRemove media from wells in both apical and basal compartment.Wash once with warm 100 µl DPBS+/+.Fix cells with 100% methanol for 15 min at -20°C in both apical and basal compartment.Aspirate fixative and wash twice with 100 /500 µl (apical/basal) DPBS+/+.Block with DPBS+/+ containing 0.1% Triton-X100 and 3% BSA for 1 h.Add 100 µl DPBS+/+ containing 0.1% Triton-X100, 3% BSA and the appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C on the apical side (example of primary antibodies include VA1 for virus, ZO1 for tight junction, UEA-1 for multiple intestinal cells, DAPI for nucleus). Keep the blocking buffer in the basal compartment.Aspirate antibody and wash twice each with 100 µl DPBS+/+.Add 100 µl DPBS+/+ containing 0.1% Triton-X100, 3% BSA and the appropriate secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT and away from light.Wash thrice with DPBS+/+.Add 100 µl DPBS+/+ containing appropriate amount of DAPI for 5 min at RT.Wash thrice with DPBS+/+.Cut out membrane from the Transwell with care and place on microscope slide with apical side face up.Place a drop of Prolong gold (without DAPI) on the membrane and place a coverslip to cover the cells.Drain excess prolong and seal with nail polisher.",
