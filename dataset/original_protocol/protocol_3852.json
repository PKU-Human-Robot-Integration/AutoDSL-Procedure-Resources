    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnimal surgery\nTiming: 60–90 min\nThis section describes steps to expose the brain surface to create a cranial window and fix the head bar to the skull. 2–4 month-old male and female Cx3cr1GFP/+ and Thy1-YFP mice and 7–8 month-old male and female 5XFAD mice and littermate controls are used in this protocol.\nUse a small-animal heating pad to maintain the mouse body temperature at 35°C–37°C during surgery and imaging.\nAnesthetize the mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg ketamine and 15 mg xylazine (KX) per kg of body weight, diluted in 0.9% NaCl solution prepared under sterile conditions. Adequate depth of anesthesia should be checked regularly during the experiment, e.g., through toe pinching. Supplement with subcutaneous KX injections when needed. In general, subcutaneous KX supplemental doses are 30%–50% of the original dose.\nApply artificial tears ointment to the eyes to prevent dehydration of the cornea.\nShave the head of the mouse, disinfect the exposed skin with betadine and 70% ethanol, and inject 2% lidocaine (or xylocaine) subcutaneously. Make an incision of approximately 1 cm to expose the skull.\nHold the mouse head gently but firmly between thumb and index finger during the following steps.\nThoroughly remove subcutaneous connective tissue, clean and dry the exposed skull area.\nUsing a small drill, make a circular moat of about 3–4 mm in diameter over the somatosensory (S1HL/S1FL) cortex until the bone inside the moat flexes under gentle pressure of a dental micro-scalpel blade.\nAttach a custom-designed steel head bar that includes an imaging chamber (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) over the bone island to the skull with cyanoacrylate glue and Metabond dental cement.",
    "Apply a drop of pre-warmed (35°C–37°C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF, in mM: 125 NaCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 3.1 CaCl2, 2.7 KCl, and 1.3 MgCl2; pH 7.4) to the imaging chamber over the bone island.\nAfter about 1 min, gently lift off the bone island with a dental microscalpel blade using the blade as a lever.\nGently flush the dura mater with pre-warmed ACSF. Make sure the imaging chamber is covered with ACSF at all times to prevent dehydration of the meninges.\nFor acute cortical microinjection experiments with simultaneous in vivo imaging, proceed to “Imaging of acute microglial responses to intracortical fibrinogen microinjection using 2P microscopy” below.\nFor longitudinal imaging experiments that will require revisiting the same cortical area for imaging tissue changes multiple times following intracortical injections, proceed to “Implantation of chronic glass window for longitudinal in vivo imaging”.\nCritical: It is recommended that the breathing rate should be regularly checked during the entire course of anesthesia. It is important to frequently stop drilling to prevent overheating the bone and damaging the underlying brain and to use compressed air to clean bone debris, as well as to cool down the bone. Before applying cyanoacrylate glue, the skull should be completely dry to ensure the solid attachment of the headbar. While lifting off the bone island with a dental microscalpel blade, great care should be taken not to touch the brain.\nImaging of acute microglial responses to intracortical fibrinogen microinjection using 2P microscopy\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step describes the in vivo imaging of acute microglial responses using Cx3cr1GFP/+ reporter mice.\nThaw an aliquot of Alexa dye-labeled fibrinogen (see section “Preparation of Alexa dye-labeled fibrinogen”) at 37°C and mix by inverting the tube 2–3 times. It is important to keep the thawed aliquot at 30°C–37°C until ready to inject.",
    "Pre-heat a pulled glass microinjection micropipette prepared in step “Preparation of pulled glass microinjection micropipettes” to 37°C and keep at 37°C until ready to inject. Pre-heating can be done by placing the microinjection micropipette on a small animal heating pad or other regulated heating element.\nIf vehicle (e.g., ACSF) solution will be microinjected, mix the solution with a fluorescent dye-labeled dextran to be able to visualize successful injection of the solute into the brain.\nFor imaging the cerebrovasculature, inject a small volume of fluorescently labeled dextran diluted in saline, intravenously (100 μL solution, 3%–5% w/v).\nPlace the mouse on the microscope stage and attach the head bar/imaging chamber to its holder (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nIntroduce a 25 × or 40 × water-immersion objective lens into the ACSF in the imaging well. The conical tip of the objective should be narrow enough to provide space for the microinjection micropipette.\nAcquire baseline images of the vasculature in the meninges and the surface of the exposed cortex, as well as of other fluorescent structures that can be used as reference images prior to injection of solutions and/or as maps to relocate the same cortical location in the future.\nUnder epifluorescence light, identify a cortical location that allows insertion of the microinjection micropipette without damage to superficial blood vessels.\nRaise the objective to create room for insertion of the microinjection micropipette underneath the objective.\nBack-fill the pre-warmed microinjection glass micropipette with the pre-warmed Alexa dye-labeled fibrinogen solution and insert the micropipette in the injector holder. The angle of the microinjection micropipette should be ∼30°–35° with tip facing downwards.\nIntroduce the microinjection micropipette into the ACSF filling the imaging chamber, and use epifluorescence to locate the micropipette, center its tip into the field of view of the objective lens, and bring it to focus.",
    "Under epifluorescence guidance, gradually lower the injection micropipette with the micromanipulator while simultaneously lowering the objective lens. This has to happen in a gradual and synchronized fashion, to ensure that the micropipette tip and objective lens travel the same distance, so that the micropipette tip remains in the focal plane of the lens. This will allow the user to be always aware of the exact location of the micropipette tip as it is slowly lowered towards the exposed cortical surface.\nContinue lowering the objective and microinjection micropipette until the dura becomes visible and the micropipette tip is right above it. If available, switch the micromanipulator settings to needle insertion mode, i.e., simultaneous downwards and forwards movement of the micropipette.\nUsing the lowest micromanipulator speed settings, gently insert the micropipette tip through the dura and into the top layer of the underlying cortex.\nSwitch the microscope to 2P laser-scanning mode. Use the 2P laser excitation wavelength, dichroic mirrors, and bandpass filters appropriate for the Alexa dye-labeled fibrinogen or fluorescent dextran-mixed vehicle/ACSF and fluorophores present in the brain.\nContinue advancing the microinjection micropipette into the cortex until reaching a minimum depth of 70–100 μm below the pial surface.\nSet the upper and lower limits of a z-stack ensuring that the tip of the micropipette lies in the middle of the stack. Start the z-stack acquisition, and pressure-eject the solution at a pressure of 0.1–0.7 bar and ejection pulse time of 0.5–2 s. The microinjector’s ejection pulse time is directly proportional to the volume injected, i.e., increasing the ejection pulse increases the injection volume. Appearance of a fluorescent cloud around the needle tip confirms successful injection (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).",
    "Set up time-lapse z-stack acquisition parameters using 1 μm z-step, and acquire a full z-stack every 2–3 min for a total of 30 min from injection, for subsequent evaluation of the response of microglial processes to the local injection of fibrinogen.\nFollowing the injection, the processes of neighboring microglia invade the area around the injection site and eventually reach the tip of the electrode (Davalos et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Davalos et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). To quantify the extent and speed of microglial responses to locally injected fibrinogen:\nCreate z-projections of the imaged volumes for each timepoint collected as part of the time-series spanning the microglial response and create the collective timelapse z-stack consisting of all these individual z-projections in sequence.\nTo account for signal intensity differences among different experiments, threshold every image in that timelapse z-stack so that all microglial processes have the maximum value 255, and all background is set to 0.",
    "Quantify the number of microglial processes entering from an outer area Y (∼70 μm in radius) into an inner area X (∼35 μm in radius) surrounding the tip of the electrode as a function of time, by counting the number of white pixels in area X over time (Rx(t)) and comparing it with the first picture taken immediately after the insertion of the electrode (Rx(0), measured in the first image of the timelapse). The number of white pixels corresponds to the region covered by processes within the area X, and its increase over time provides a measure of the microglial response. To account for the variability in the number of microglia located in the outer area Y in different experiments, calculate the microglial response relative to the number of processes in the outer area Y immediately after the insertion of the electrode (Ry(0), measured in the first image of the timelapse). The microglial response at any time point (R(t)) is therefore given by R(t) = ( Rx(t) – Rx(0) ) / Ry(0).\nRepeat the same procedure for the control (ACSF) injections and plot both responses over time as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/767-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Place a round glass coverslip (3 mm in diameter, type 0) on top of the dura, making sure it is resting completely on/flush with the dura.\nSeal the edges of the coverslip with Flow-It™ ALC™ composite and cure the Flow-It™ ALC™ composite under UV light.\nFollow post-operative care instructions (steps 65–68) and allow 14–21 days for the tissue to recover from the surgery and for the inflammatory response to the cranial window implantation to subside.\nLongitudinal in vivo 2P imaging of microglial responses and dendritic spine elimination in response to fibrinogen microinjection in healthy mice\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis step describes longitudinal in vivo 2P imaging of microglial responses, dendrite loss and dendritic spine elimination in layer I-II of the cortex of Thy1-YFP:Cx3cr1GFP/+ mice (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).",
    "To perform intracortical fibrinogen microinjection, follow steps 14–32 of “Imaging of acute microglial responses to intracortical fibrinogen microinjection using 2P microscopy”.\nAcquire baseline/day 0 images of microglia, dendrites, dendritic spines and the vasculature (Merlini et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]):\nSet an xyz stack of 100 × 100 × 60 μm around the electrode tip, and inject a small volume (5–10 pL) of the respective solution with a pressure injector (Narishige) at a pressure of 0.35–0.6 bar during simultaneous imaging of the neurites, spines, and microglia at 4× optical zoom (40× objective lens).\nAcquire additional xyz stacks with the 40× objective lens at 1× and 2× optical zoom and with the 10× objective lens at 1× optical zoom to create overview maps of the vasculature and dendritic structures for relocation of the same imaging site.\nPlace and seal a new coverslip over the craniotomy.\nFor re-imaging three days later, anesthetize the mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg ketamine and 15 mg xylazine (KX) per kg of body weight, diluted in 0.9% NaCl solution prepared under sterile conditions (see section on “Animal surgery” above) and fix the mouse underneath the microscope by attaching the headbar/imaging chamber to the mounting post.\nTo re-image the exact same imaging region(s) of interest (ROIs) follow the ROI re-location method (Grutzendler et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Merlini et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/767-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Calculate the number of spines on these dendrites at day 3 as percentage of that at baseline.\nQuantification should be performed by researchers blinded to the injection agent (fibrinogen or ACSF).\nNote: This method can be used for labeling microglia, dendrites and dendritic spines as well as the vasculature using Thy1-YFP:Cx3cr1GFP/+ mice (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). Fibrinogen microinjection can be performed following steps 14–32 outlined above.

This protocol has been used for the in vivo labeling of fibrinogen in the spinal cord (Davalos et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) and brain (Merlini et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Ryu et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/767-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Thaw the required number of aliquots of Alexa dye-conjugated fibrinogen at 37°C using a heating block. After thawing, invert the solution/aliquot tube 2–3 times.\nUnder light isoflurane anesthesia, i.e., 1.5%–2% isoflurane at an oxygen flow rate of 0.5 L/min, inject 100 μL of Alexa dye-conjugated fibrinogen retro-orbitally by inserting a 28-gauge 0.5-mL insulin syringe in the retro-orbital sinus, which is located caudally to each eye.\nPerform the imaging experiment 24 h after the second injection (see note about injection time points above) using the 2P excitation laser wavelength and emission filter appropriate for the Alexa dye-conjugated fibrinogen used",
    "Critical: Please see “Preparation of Alexa dye-labeled fibrinogen” steps 5–9 for protocol of fibrinogen preparation. It is recommended to seek training by veterinary staff for proper administration technique in the retro-orbital sinus without damaging the eye. Also, performing the r.o injection while the mouse is (lightly) anesthetized mice is critical because potential twitching/jerking of the mouse head may cause r.o. vascular damage and, hence, mechanical damage-induced intra-cerebral extravasation of fibrinogen.\nLongitudinal in vivo 2P imaging of spine elimination around fibrinogen deposits and Aβ plaques in 5xFAD mice\nTiming: ∼2h\nThis section describes steps for longitudinal in vivo 2P imaging of dendrites and dendritic spines around fibrinogen deposits and Aβ plaques in an AD mouse model.\nPut the mouse on a temperature-controlled stereotaxic injection frame and fix the head with ear bars.\nFill a Hamilton syringe (attached to a beveled 33-G needle) with AAV1.hSyn.eGFP.WPRE.bGH (titer ≥ 7×1012 vg/mL) to fluorescently label dendritic spines through viral infection.\nUsing a dissection scope, move the syringe to the prefrontal cortical area, lower the syringe until the needle tip touches the skull and record the z coordinate. Perform the same steps for measuring the z coordinate of lambda.\nAdjust the alignment of the mouse head in the stereotaxic device to yield a < 0.3 mm difference between the prefrontal cortical and lambda z coordinates.\nMove the syringe to bregma and record the A/P and M/L stereotaxic coordinates.\nMove the syringe to the somatosensory cortex (in mm from bregma: A/P -0.75, M/L +1.5). Mark location on the skull, then raise the syringe.\nDrill a hole through the skull at the identified location.\nLower the syringe until the tip of the needle touches the dura mater and record the z coordinate. Lower the needle to 1.00 mm below the dura mater.",
    "Inject 1 μL of the virus using an autoinjector set at a speed of 60 nL/min. After the injection, wait 5 min for the virus to diffuse. Slowly raise the syringe and perform “Animal surgery” steps 1–13 and “Implantation of chronic glass window for longitudinal in vivo imaging” steps 33–35.\nAllow a 14-day incubation time for the virus to infect neurons.\nPerform r.o. administration of fluorescently labeled fibrinogen as described under “In vivo fibrinogen labeling: retro-orbital injections of Alexa dye-conjugated fibrinogen” steps 42–44.\nOn day 2 of the r.o. fibrinogen injection, i.e., one day before imaging, administer Methoxy-XO4 (5 mg/kg) by intraperitoneal injection.\nUse screws to secure head bar with the holder, then fix mouse under the 2P microscope.\nUse epifluorescence to locate the cranial window.\nLocate dendritic spines 100 μm below the dura with and without Alexa 594-labeled fibrinogen deposits and which are located < 50 and > 50 μm of a Methoxy-XO4-labeled amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque. Use 2P wavelengths of 840 nm and 920 nm and a 40 × objective at 4 × optical zoom.\nAcquire a stack of 100 × 100 × 60 μm around the region of interest.\nAcquire additional xyz stacks with the 40 × objective lens at 1 × and 2 × optical zoom and with the 10 × objective lens at 1 × optical zoom to create overview maps of the dendritic structures for relocation of the same imaging site.\nFourteen days later, locate the same imaging area using the 10 × and 40 × vascular overview maps and re-image as described above in steps 38 and 39 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).",
    "Critical: To avoid recording cellular responses due to potential injection-induced brain injury, it is recommended to avoid the needle trace when selecting the ROI for imaging. While drilling the skull at the identified location for viral transfection, it is advised to maintain the minimum widening of the bone surface area necessary for the injection needle and great care should be taken not to touch the dura.\nNote: An alternative to labeling of dendritic spines by AAV1.hSyn.eGFP.WPRE.bGH injection (steps 45–54) is the use of Thy1-YFP:5XFAD fluorescent reporter mice. Fibrinogen and Methoxy-XO4 labeling can be performed in Thy1-YFP:5XFAD mice following steps 55–62 as we previously described (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) (Ryu et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/767-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

House the mouse individually.",
    "Provide analgesia every 6–12 h for 2 days post-operatively or as needed, and as recommended by veterinary staff and IACUC. Daily monitoring of each mouse is required to ensure normal behavior and full recovery from each surgical procedure and imaging session.\nCritical: Post-operative use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as carprofen or dexamethasone have been shown in prior studies to improve recovery and optical quality of glass windows. However, when performing microglia imaging studies, it is highly recommended to not use any anti-inflammatory drugs before, during, or after surgery as they may alter microglia morphology and dynamics."
