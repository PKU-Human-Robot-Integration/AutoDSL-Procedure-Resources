    "All animals were handled in full compliance with Danish and European regulations. Permission number: 2012-15-2934.\n1. Preparation of the Syringe for Hydraulic Extrusion of the Spinal Cord\nFor an adult rat, use a 10 mL syringe. For an adult mouse, use a 5 mL syringe. For pups, use a 2.5 mL syringe.\nAdjust a non-filter pipette tip universally suitable for 2-200 µL pipettes by trimming the large end of the pipette tip until it fits firmly to the syringe. Place the adjusted pipette tip on the syringe. For pups, use a 23 G or similar needle instead of an adjusted pipette tip.\nAspirate ice-cold sterile PBS and leave the syringe on ice until further use.\n2. Euthanasia\nDo not perform cervical dislocation, as this will disturb the spinal vertebrae rendering extrusion impossible.\nFor adult rat/mouse, euthanize using gas such as CO2 or isoflurane. These substances are harmful. Perform euthanasia in a fume hood and handle the substances according to institution guidelines. (CAUTION: CO2: H280, P410, P403; isoflurane: H361d, P260, P281, P280)\n\t\nTo ensure that the rodent is dead, ensure absence of reflex by pinching a paw with tweezers. Decapitate the rodent using large scissors. For pups, euthanize by decapitation.\n3. Isolation of the Spinal Column\nSprinkle water onto the fur to control the hair.\nUsing a pair of scissors, cut open the fur along the spinal column in a distal direction and isolate the spinal column by cutting on both sides along the spinal column past the pelvic bone. Cut the spinal cord distally to the pelvic bone with a pair of scissors.\n\tNOTE: The rostral-caudal axis is denoted as the proximal-distal axis throughout the protocol.",
    "Trim the spinal column using a pair of scissors to avoid the proximal-most and distal-most areas as these may render the spinal column too S-shaped for successful spinal cord extrusion. Ensure that the spinal cord is visible at both ends. If the spinal cord is not visible, trim the spinal column with scissors until the spinal cord becomes visible.\n4. Hydraulic Extrusion of the Spinal Cord\nPlace a Petri dish (100 mm in diameter) filled with sterile PBS on ice.\nStraighten the spinal column by applying an index finger on the bent part (proximal-most end) of the spinal column, thereby straightening the spinal column as much as possible.\n\t\nFor pups, avoid bending the spinal column, as the vertebrae will be disrupted rendering spinal cord extrusion impossible.\nInsert the pipette tip (23 G needle for pups, alternatively 18 G needle for adult mice) at the distal-most end of spinal column. If inserted correctly, the tip is stabilized in the spinal cavity.\nEnsure that the spinal column is straightened as much as possible. Apply steady pressure, and extrude the spinal cord into the Petri dish on ice. Ensure that the spinal cord is kept moist on ice by keeping it in PBS until further handling.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55226/55226fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Representative spinal cords.

Identification of Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRGs)\nSplit the spinal column in two equal longitudinal parts using scissors and place the split spinal column under the microscope.",
    "Identify the T13 vertebra segment by locating the attachment site of the distal-most costae on the spinal column paying attention not to confuse the costae with the nearby intercostal nerves. The distal-most costae are attached to the proximal part of the T13 vertebra segment and the T13 DRG is located distally to vertebra T13 and proximally to vertebra L1.\nIdentify concomitant DRGs in the distal direction. For an adult rat, concomitant DRGs appear white with clearly visible dorsal and ventral roots. For an adult mouse, concomitant DRGs appear white with clearly visible dorsal and ventral roots. For pups, concomitant DRGs appear as clear spheres.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55226/55226fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Identification of DRGs in spinal column after extrusion of spinal cord.

Isolation of DRGs\nNumber Petri dishes (30 mm in diameter) according to the specific DRGs to be isolated, e.g. L3, L4, L5. Fill the Petri dishes with ice-cold sterile PBS and place them on ice.\nUsing micro scissors, cut dorsal and ventral roots as close to the DRGs as possible to release them while avoiding damaging the DRGs.\nWith the tip of closed tweezers, gently scoop out DRGs and transfer them to the corresponding numbered Petri dishes.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55226/55226fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Representative isolated DRGs.

Processing of Tissues for Further Analysis\nWestern blotting\n\t\nIsolate the tissue area of interest, e.g. the spinal cord lumbar enlargement. If needed, separate the spinal cord into ipsilateral and contralateral sides and further into dorsal and ventral horns.",
    "Place the tissue in lysis buffer such as TNE lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-base, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP40 in double distilled H2O) containing appropriate enzyme inhibitors on ice.\nHomogenize the tissue for approximately 30 s on ice using a mechanical grinding pestle.\nCentrifuge for 15 min at 16,000 x g at 4 °C and use the supernatant for further processing according to standard protocols5,6 or keep the supernatant at -20 °C until further use.\nRNA-analysis\n\t\nIsolate the tissue of interest.\nImmediately place the tissue in RNA stabilization solution to stabilize the RNA for storage.\nIsolate RNA according to standard protocols7.\nConvert RNA to cDNA and perform qPCR according to standard protocols7.\nImmunohistochemistry\n\t\nFor fresh-frozen tissue (applicable to spinal cord):\n\t\t\nPrepare dry ice powder by pulverizing dry ice cubes to an amount corresponding to two tablespoons of powder. Cover dry ice cubes in a cloth and pulverize the cubes using a hammer. Place silver foil (approximately 5 cm x 5 cm) on a layer of dry ice cubes and cover the silver foil with dry ice powder.\nPlace the spinal cord area selected for further analyses on the dry ice powder using tweezers, let it snap-freeze, and transfer the spinal cord to a cryo tube. Keep it on dry ice at all times or store it at -80 °C until further use.\nTransfer the spinal cord to a cryostat (-20 °C). If needed, trim the spinal cord inside the cryostat. Place the spinal cord in embedding material inside the cryostat in order to attach it to the specimen disc.",
    "Cut the spinal cord in the desired thickness, e.g. 5 µm, and collect on glass plates. Heat the glass plates with a finger immediately prior to tissue collection for better attachment. Keep any leftover tissue in cryo tubes at -80 °C until further use.\nLeave the sections on glass plates inside the cryostat until ready for post-fixing.\nPost-fix the sections by immersion into 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature.\nPerform staining according to standard protocols8.\nFixed tissue for cryo sectioning (applicable to spinal cord and DRGs)\n\t\t\nFix spinal cord and DRGs in 4% PFA (2 h for spinal cord, 1.5 h for mouse DRGs and 4 h for rat DRGs) at 4 °C (place spinal cord in horizontal position to prevent it from fixing in a bent position).\nTransfer the tissue to 25% w/v sucrose overnight at 4 °C. The tissue can be stored in 25% w/v sucrose supplemented with a few droplets of 10% sodium azide to prevent microbial contamination at 4 °C until further use. If needed, trim the spinal cord to make up the lumbar enlargement only on a silicone board or similar.\nUsing the tip of a paper towel, aspirate excess sucrose solution from the tissue.\nFill a cryo mold halfway with embedding material. Push any bubbles to the sides of the cryo mold with tools such as closed tweezers.\nPlace the tissue on the embedding material using tweezers and ensure the desired tissue orientation.\nFill the cryo mold completely with embedding material and push any bubbles as far away from the tissue as possible (e.g. by using closed tweezers).",
    "Fill a Petri dish (100 mm in diameter) with 2-methylbutane. This substance is harmful. Perform this step in a fume hood and handle the substance according to institution guidelines (CAUTION: H224, H304, H336, H411, P210, P280, P273, P301, P331, P304/P340, P309/P310).\nPlace the Petri dish on a layer of dry ice and add two dry ice cubes to the Petri dish. Place the cryo mold in the Petri dish and allow the embedding material to freeze completely.\nKeep the embedded tissue on dry ice at all times or at -80 °C wrapped in Parafilm until further processing.\nCut the tissue on a cryostat (-20 °C) in the desired thickness, e.g. 5 µm.\nPerform staining according to standard protocols8.\nFixed tissue for paraffin-embedding (applicable to spinal cord and DRGs)\n\t\t\nFix spinal cord and DRGs in 4% PFA (2 h for spinal cord, 1.5 h for mouse DRGs and 4 h for rat DRGs) at 4 °C (place spinal cord in horizontal position to prevent it from fixing in a bent position).\nTransfer the tissue to 25% w/v sucrose overnight at 4 °C. The tissue can be stored in 25% w/v sucrose supplemented with a few droplets of 10% sodium azide to prevent microbial contamination at 4 °C until further use.\nIsolate the tissue area of interest, e.g. the spinal cord lumbar enlargement.\nFill an embedding mold halfway with paraffin.\nCool down the embedding mold briefly by placing it on the cooling area of the embedding machine to harden the paraffin slightly. This allows for better tissue positioning.\nPlace the tissue in the desired orientation in the embedding mold. Fill the embedding mold with paraffin and cool immediately.",
    "Place the paraffin-containing embedding mold at 4 °C overnight to let it harden completely and remove the paraffin block containing the tissue from the embedding mold.\nCut sections on a microtome in the desired thickness, e.g. 5 µm.\nPerform staining according to standard protocols8."
