    "1. Skull Penetration\nAnaesthetize rat with isoflurane (5% induction, 1.5-2% maintenance) in 70% N2 and 30% O2. Following induction of anaesthesia, place the rat prone on a warming plate, positioning the rat's nose in an anaesthetic nose cone.\nWhilst maintaining anaesthesia, secure the head in a stereotaxic frame, inserting the ear-bars until head is stabilised. Ensure breathing is not impaired. (Figure 2-A).\nInject scalp subcutaneously with long lasting local anaesthetic, Bupivacaine 0.3 ml 0.5% (Pfizer, Australia) before making a 1.5 cm skin midline head incision. (Sterile instruments and gloves should be used.)\nBlunt dissect the soft tissue and surrounding muscles to clearly locate Lambda and Bregma. Retract the skin and connective tissue.\nStem any bleeding by applying pressure to the exposed skull. Excessive skull bleeding may be cauterized.\nUsing a dental drill with a 1 mm tip burr, burr a hole 2 mm wide into the right parietal bone. Burr the hole 2 mm lateral and 2 mm posterior from Bregma to avoid the superior sagittal sinus and ensure the placement of the ICP sensor is over the ischemic territory, for stroke studies. Alternative locations would be equally suitable for other applications. Burr the hole to a depth where the skull above the dura becomes translucent. (Figure 2-B).\nReplace the burr with a 0.5 mm tip burr to remove the skull at the base of hole.\nWhen the skull begins to crack, use 45° forceps to remove all remaining skull, ensuring the base of the hole is cleared of debris. (Figure 3).\n2. Screw Modification and Insertion\nDrill a 0.7 mm hole through a hexagonal-headed screw using a lathe and 0.7 mm drill bit.",
    "Insert the monitoring screw into the hole by turning it approximately 1.5 turns (use the minimum amount of turns needed to secure screw in skull so as not to damage underlying tissue). (Figure 2-C and Figure 4).\nBurr a second hole for an anchoring screw in the left parietal bone, 2 mm lateral and 2 mm posterior from Bregma. This hole does not require complete penetration of the skull, so the 1 mm tip burr is used to thin the skull for screw insertion.\nInsert a 2 x 4 mm hexagonal-headed screw into the second hole. This screw helps to anchor the dental cement and hence the monitoring screw to the skull.\nUse a transfer pipette to mix and apply dental cement monomer and polymer to the base of the head of the screws.\nAllow dental cement to dry for at least 10 minutes.\n3. Intracranial Pressure Transducer Insertion\nUsing white correction fluid, mark the fibre-optic sensor 4 mm from the tip.\nFill the hole of the monitoring screw with sterile saline (0.9%) and ensure no air bubbles are present within the screw.\nInsert the ICP probe 4 mm into the screw so that the tip of the probe is level with the end of the screw. Ensure the tip does not pierce the dura.\nAdjust the tip of the probe within the screw until an ICP trace reflecting ventilation and blood pressure pulse waves can be observed. (Figure 5).\n4. Forming an Airtight Seal",
    "An airtight seal is imperative to an accurate ICP reading. Mix a viscous biocompatible caulking material monomer and polymer in the ratio of 1:1. Because the pressure sensor is at the tip of the probe, and this is within the hollowed out screw, application of caulking material to the shaft of the fibre-optic probe has no effect on pressure sensitivity of the sensor.\nApply a thin layer around the probe and the head of the monitoring screw. Avoid displacing the ICP probe.\nAllow to set for 5 minutes.\nApply a second layer of caulking material around the entire monitoring screw and probe. Ensure that no liquid is leaking from any crevasses in the caulking material. (Figure 2-D).\nRemove ear-bars.\nThe rat may remain in the prone position, or be carefully rotated into the supine position during ICP monitoring.\nA schematic of the completed procedure is depicted in (Figure 6).\n5. Intracranial Pressure Transducer Removal and Reinsertion\nAt the completion ICP monitoring, the ICP sensor may be removed by gently pulling the catheter from the screw and caulking material.\nThe SAMBA sensor should be immediately place into 1 % Terg-A-Zyme solution to prevent tip corrosion.\nThe hole remaining in the caulking material should be covered with an additional layer of caulking material. (Rat may be woken at this stage).\nTo reinsert the SAMBA catheter for additional monitoring, slice the caulking material at the level of the head of the screw.\nRepeat steps 3.2 - 5.3.\n6. Representative Results",
    "Figure 5 is a representation of ICP readings over ten seconds. At baseline, the average ICP in a Wistar rat is 6 mmHg. The events of shorter periodicity depicted in Figure 5 reflect blood pressure pulse waves. The events of longer periodicity show ventilation events. Note that the SAMBA sensor reflects a ventilation amplitude of 3-4 mmHg and pulse amplitude of 1-2 mmHg.\nTo validate the position of the SAMBA sensor in each experiment, ICP traces should be tested for responsiveness to abdominal compressions and respiratory events, such as periods of apnoea. An abdominal compression is depicted in Figure 7.\nPeriods of apnoea (illustrated in Figure 8) are observed in most experiments involving spontaneously breathing animals. These events are identified on physiological records by an absence of respiratory deflections on respiratory (diaphragm transducer) and arterial pressure traces. An equivalent alteration in the ICP trace validates the ICP probe positioning.\nFigure 9 depicts a typical ICP trace after the removal of the ear-bars (step 4.6). The insertion of the ear-bars in step 1.2 results in a slight compression of the skull and consequent disruption in intracranial volume and hence an increased ICP. If the sensor is positioned correctly, ICP will drop at least 4 - 5 mmHg with the removal of the ear-bars.\nHistological analysis may be used to check for any damage to the cortical area immediately under the pressure sensor and screw. An example of a traumatic and non-traumatic screw insertion is depicted in Figure 4.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3689/3689fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Fluid Filled Vs SAMBA ICP Traces. ICP was recorded simultaneously via the SAMBA fibre-optic catheter (top) and a fluid filled catheter (bottom). The mean ICP values were similar in both traces, however the fluid filled catheter signal was notably dampened compared to the clear respiratory and arterial pressure waveforms seen with the fibre-optic catheter.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3689/3689fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Intracranial Pressure Catheter Insertion Procedure. The rat's head was secured in a stereotaxic frame with ear-bars and an anaesthetic nose cone [A]. A hole, approximately 2 mm in diameter, was drilled into the right parietal bone [B]. A 2 x 4 mm screw with a 0.7 mm hole in the shaft was inserted [C]. An anchoring screw was inserted into the left parietal bone and the skull and surgical site covered in dental cement. The ICP catheter (black arrow) was then inserted into the screw-hole and an airtight seal made with the caulking material (white arrow) [D].

Abdominal Compression. The abdomen was temporarily compressed (~1 sec) to validate the viability of the ICP signal. Compression results in reduced cerebral venous return, increasing intracranial volume and thus increasing ICP. Arterial pressure (Pa) dropped only after the initial ICP rise.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3689/3689fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Period of Apnoea.
