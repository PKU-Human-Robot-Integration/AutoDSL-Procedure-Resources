    "Mouse tissue collection and fixationNote: Because most Ab used in this report are monoclonal Ab, the single epitope recognized by the Ab are often destroyed by harsh fixation. Thus a mild fixation method with limited reaction period was used. This fixation method also improves tissue staining by polyclonal Ab. Fill reservoirs a and b (Figure 2B) in the perfusion assembly with PBS and 2% PLP respectively. Expel air bubbles by first opening the 3-way stopper to allow 2% PLP to flow into the vacutainer. Switch valve position to allow PBS to flush the perfusion line and to stop 2% PLP flow. Ensure that all bubbles are purged. Clamp the vacutainer line with a hemostat.Inject mice i.p. with 0.225 ml anesthesia mix (Recipe 14). Wait for 3-5 min until the mouse loses the foot pinch reflex. Pin the mouse on a vinyl dissection pad in a dissection tray (Figure 2A; Figure 3A)The surgical procedure is illustrated in Figure 3. Open skin by first making a nick in the posterior end of the abdomen at the midline (Figure 3A). Insert the closed scissors blades underneath the skin towards the anterior end of the thorax (Figure 3B). Open the blades (Figure 3C) and slide in the posterior direction to separate the skin from the abdominal and thoracic walls.Slit open the skin along the midline (Figure 3D) and pin the skin on the side to keep the rib cage exposed (Figure 3E).Nick the abdominal wall with a pair of scissors (Figure 3F). Insert the pointed blade into the opening and cut open the abdomen wall short of the diaphragm. Cut sideways to open up the abdomen.Lift the rib cage at the diaphragm to identify the location of the heart.",
    "Poke gently through the diaphragm with the pointed blade of the scissors toward the heart to release air into the rib cage. This will create space in the thoracic cavity and facilitate incisions without damaging the heart and lungs (Figure 3G).Cut the rib cage along the midline until the larynx (Figure 3H). Excise the rib cage from the side to expose the heart (Figures 3I and 3J).Open blades of a small pair of scissors and press down on the heart to position the overhanging segment of the right atrium between the blades (Figure 3K). Excise the atrium segment to create the perfusion outlet.Grab the heart with a pair of #3 forceps (Figure 3L) and insert the needle of the vacutainer into the apex of the left ventricle (Figure 3M). Release the vacutainer clamp to commence PBS flush. Ensure that no air bubble drains into the heart.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200630/20200630184653_6349.jpgFigure 3. Kidney perfusion through the left ventricle. The details of the method are described in Steps A2-A9.After the 20 ml PBS flush, turn valve to flush with 20 ml 2% PLP.Clamp vacutainer tubing.Remove kidney capsule by grabbing the capsule near the hilum with a #3 forceps. Carefully puncture the capsule with a fine pair of scissors. Insert blade and push outward and upward to remove capsule. Excise kidneys. Cut 1 mm traverse sections with a razor blade.Note: Select central kidney slices near the traverse midline such that cortex, medulla and papilla regions are included in each slice. Two such kidney slices are fixed in 2% PLP for immunofluorescence staining and 2 slices are fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin (Fisher) for histological staining. Two additional slices flanking the central slices on each side are combined with the 2 central pieces for 2% PLP fixation for added glomeruli scoring.",
    "Usually 1 kidney is cut into slices for immunofluorescence and histological staining and the other kidney is cut in half, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored for biochemical analyses. Place the tissue slices into tissue cassettes and fix in 2% PLP on ice for 3 h.Remove p-formaldehyde and equilibrate the tissue in sucrose for preservation by washing tissues twice in PBS followed by soaking in 5% sucrose at 4 °C overnight.Note: It is critical to remove p-formaldehyde by soaking in low percentages of sucrose for at least several hours. Residual p-formaldehyde causes high background, especially at the shorter wavelengths. Graded percentages of sucrose solutions are then used to bring the tissue sucrose content to 30% to minimize ice crystal formation during freezing for better tissue architecture preservation and for extracting water to reduce swelling. Avoid prolonged soaking in 30% sucrose because the high osmolarity causes shrinkage of the tubules. The tissue is finally dipped briefly in 4 successive wells of OCT compound before embedding to remove surface sucrose for easier sectioning on the cryostat. Change solutions and equilibrate the tissue in 15% sucrose for 2 h followed by 30% sucrose for 3 h.Dip tissue slices briefly in 4 consecutive wells of OCT in 24-well plates to coat tissue slices thoroughly with OCT. Immerse tissue in OCT in base molds with the cut surface facing down. Press tissue down towards the sectioning face of the tissue block. Freeze on dry ice.Store in -70 °C freezers.Tissue stainingCut 5 µm sections and place on Superfrost plus slides, 2 sections per slide.Label slides on the frosted surface with a Sharpie marker.Encircle tissues by etching with a diamond knife on the underside of the slide to facilitate tissue localization during microscopy.",
    "Place slides in Coplin staining jars and wash 2 ×, 5 min each with PBS.Add detergent extraction medium and incubate at room temperature (RT) for 30 min.Wash 2 times, 5 min each, with PBS.Block non-specific binding with blocking solution for 2 h at RT.Prepare Ab mixes using 2 µg/ml of each Ab and up to 4 Ab labeled with respective fluorochromes of BV421, A-488, A-555, and A-647. Dilute Ab in blocking medium.Notes:DAPI for nucleus localization can be used instead of BV421-conjugated Ab (see Recipes for DAPI use). Avoid using secondary Ab for kidney staining. For direct staining with purified unconjugated Ab, label Ab with Thermo Fisher (Invitrogen) mAb labeling kits as described by the suppliers. Wash slides 2 times, 5 min each, with PBS. Suction off liquid around the tissue slices with a Pasteur pipet and place slides in a 24.5 cm × 24.5 cm Bioassay dish lined at the bottom with a square wetted #3 Whatman filter paper. Do not allow the kidney tissue to go dry.Pipet 50 µl Ab mix onto the tissue section and spread the solution with the pipet tip to cover all areas of the tissue.Incubate for 2 h to overnight at 4 °C in the dark.At the end of the Ab staining, stand slide lengthwise upright and tap on a paper towel to drain off staining solutions.Place in PBS. Wash 4 times, 5 min each.Suction off liquid and put a small drop of mounting medium on the tissue slices. Place a #1 coverglass on top. Invert slide and press down on a paper towel to spread out the mounting medium.Place in a slide box.Image capture Set up the confocal microscope using the “Smart Setting”. Images were captured with 3 track excitation: track 1, PacBl, A-647, T-PMT; track 2, A-488; track 3, A-555.",
    "Other settings were: Image size, 1,024 × 1,024; scan speed, 7; scan mode, frame; averaging, 2, frame, mean, 8 bit; gain, 750. Other parameters are at default or set automatically by “Smart Setting”. Most images were captured with the 20× objective.Note: Settings on the confocal microscope can be varied to optimize the collection time, resolution, and photobleaching attenuation. In the locate mode, use a 10× objective to locate the field of interest and approximate focus with brightfield or a single red or green fluorescence channel.Switch to the 20× lens. Locate the field of interest and focus.In the “Acquisition” mode, set Scan Area to maximum. Turn on one laser and switch the others off. Increase laser power for image visualization. Click “Live” to set focus with fine focusing knob and image brightness with laser power. Turn on the “Range indicator” in the laser power adjustment to minimize off scale fluorescence.Set brightness for all channels by adjusting the laser power one color at a time (see Figures 4A-4C for optimal exposure).Turn on all 3 lasers and scan with “Live” to ensure optimal color intensities.Capture the image using “Snap”.Save image in LSM or CZI format.Use the “Crop” button under the “Dimensions” tab to magnify subregions or structures in the captured image.Collect 1 cycle of image capture with Snap for brightness adjustment. Collect final cropped image with “Snap” and save.Confocal image analysisOpen image files by ZEN Lite blue, a free download from the Zeiss website.Adjust brightness and background of each channel with the slider in the Histogram panel. Avoid offscale adjustment and keep gamma at 1.0 (see Figure 4 for optimal settings).Set pseudocolor for each channel. For confocal images, limit the single colors to red, green, and blue for easy colocalization determination.",
    "Colocalization colors are: green and red, yellow; green and blue, cyan; red and blue, magenta; green, red, and blue, white.Place scale bars in images.Export single color and confocal images as TIFF files.Use Photoshop to trim images, compile composite figures, and label panels.Save composite images with LZW and ZIP for image and layer compression respectively.Merge layers, adjust image size, and save as TIFF files for publication.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200630/20200630185327_8073.jpgFigure 4. Setting channel brightness in confocal images. The brightness and background intensities were adjusted with the sliders in the Histogram panel in Zeiss Zen Lite software. Brightness is increased until red regions which designates offscale intensity barely appears (panels A-C). Scale bar in panel G equals 10 μm."
