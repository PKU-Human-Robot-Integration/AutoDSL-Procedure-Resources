    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMain procedure: Dissection\nTiming: 10 min\nThis step describes the procedure for dissecting out each of the three neurogenic niches (SVZ, SGZ and CC) containing the adult neural stem cells. It is not advisable to extract more than one neurogenic niche per animal as keeping tissue over prolonged time periods on ice will significantly impact the percentage of retrieved viable cells. To mitigate this, additional workstations can be set up to process each extracted niche in parallel.\nCritical: The entire process from decapitation to transport should take no longer than 5 min. It is recommended to familiarize with the procedure practicing on cadavers before attempting the first harvest. Try to avoid pieces of white matter being mixed in during dissection (especially the CC), as these will significantly hamper the dissociation. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] may be useful.\nBrain Dissection:\nEuthanize the animal by first inducing deep anesthesia with 4% Isoflurane followed by decapitation. Disinfect the animal thoroughly before starting the dissection.\nRemove head and cut open the scalp with surgical scissors to expose the skull.\nCut off the remnant of the spinal column with the bone scissors. Break open the back of the skull with rongeurs and cut away the pieces of skull with the bone scissors.\nInsert the sharp blade of the surgical scissors into the skull along the longitudinal fissure and cut open the skull (superficial damage to the brain during this step is not a problem).\nRemove the surgical scissors and carefully insert the Heidemann spatula through the crack down the midline and release the Dura Mater from the skull on both sides before opening the skull with the rongeurs.",
    "When fully exposed, extract the brain with a curved hippocampal dissection tool and transfer to the ice-cold glass plate, and soak in ice-cold sterile saline.\nDiscard remains and surgical barrier sheet.\nFor subgranular zone (SGZ) extraction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1704-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

(VI) Dentate gyrus (arrow) after extraction from the hippocampal formation (above), all scale bars: ≈5.0 mm.\nCritical: Make sure the tissue remains chilled at all times by periodically dousing it in ice-cold sterile saline to improve cell survival.\nRemove the cerebellum entirely before separating the two hemispheres sagittally down the midline using a sterilized and chilled razor blade.\nRemove the remaining part of the brain stem, cerebellum and as much of the basal ganglia as possible with the bone scissors, exposing the hippocampus on one hemisphere.\nUsing the Heidemann spatula, cut the hippocampus in two equal parts down the middle (dorsal-ventral).\nGently move the Heidemann spatula underneath the dorsal hippocampal section and gently flip it out of the brain and onto the filter paper-covered chilled glass plate. Discard what is left of the hemisphere.\nUsing the Heidemann spatula and forceps, isolate the dentate gyrus from the rest of the hippocampal formation.",
    "Discard the CA regions of the hippocampus, (unless there is capacity and set up enabling simultaneous processing of the relevant tissue), remove the filter paper and thoroughly dice the dentate gyrus tissue with a chilled and sterile razor blade, and transfer to the vial with ice-cold Neurobasal 1× with a graduated transfer pipette for transport and dissociation.\nRepeat for 2nd hemisphere, and transport tissue from both hemispheres in the same 15 mL tube on ice.\nFor subventricular zone (SVZ) extraction (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1704-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

(II) (left) location of lateral SVZ as seen after cutting the brain coronally, (right) lateral SVZ highlighted. (III) View of lateral SVZ after removal of basal ganglia and medial SVZ. (IV) (left) lateral SVZ fully exposed after removal of overhanging cortical and corpus callosum tissue, (right) lateral exposed SVZ highlighted. (V) Extraction of lateral SVZ. (VI) SVZ after extraction, all scale bars: ≈5.0 mm.\nCritical: Make sure the tissue remains chilled at all times by periodically dousing it in ice-cold sterile saline to improve cell survival.\nRemove the cerebellum entirely before separating the two hemispheres sagittally down the midline using a sterilized and chilled razor blade.\nUsing the apical tip of the hippocampus as a marker, cut one hemisphere coronally 0.5 mm anterior to the hippocampal apex.\nDiscard the caudal part of the brain hemisphere and trim away remnant of basal ganglia and cut away the overhanging cortex using the fine forceps and small dissection scissors, fully exposing the Subventricular zone.\nUsing the Vannas spring scissors and forceps, gently cut out the anterior 2/3 of the lateral SVZ in a single thin sheet.",
    "Note: Make sure the tissue excised is a uniform light brown color. White webbing-like tissue will indicate when too much tissue has been cut out laterally.\nNote: The rate of NSC proliferation has been shown to occur in the anterior SVZ, so to reduce the amount of additional tissue, it is recommended to only extract the anterior 2/3 (Falcão et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). The lateral wall of the SVZ mainly gives rise to neurons and astrocytes, while the medial wall primarily gives rise to oligodendrocytes (Mizrak et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]), it is recommended to take this into consideration when dissecting.\nTransfer the SVZ onto the filter paper-covered chilled glass plate and dice thoroughly with a sterile and chilled razor blade, and transfer to the vial with ice-cold Neurobasal 1× with a graduated transfer pipette for transport and dissociation.\nRepeat for 2nd hemisphere, and transport tissue from both hemispheres in the same 15 mL tube on ice.\nExtracting SGZ & SVZ neurogenic niches from the same animal.\nCritical: Make sure tissue dissociation steps (39–53) are set up in such a way that the tissues can be processed in parallel. It is recommended to have two parallel setups (fume hood and centrifuge) with one person processing each extracted niche separately. It is not recommended to additionally extract the CC neurogenic niche from the same animal as spinal cord dissection and CC extraction take a long time and this will negatively impact cell viability.\nPrepare the brain for the niche extractions as described in steps 8–10 & 15–17. Ensure that all pieces of the brain are continuously chilled with ice-cold PBS throughout the procedure to minimize cell loss.\nExtract the SGZ as described in steps 10–14 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",
    "Immediately extract the SVZ as described in steps 17–20, excluding the removal of the caudal section of the hemisphere if the SVZ is extracted prior to the SGZ (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nProceed to tissue dissociation section.\nSpinal cord dissection:\nOpen up chest and stomach, removing all internal organs using the surgical scissors.\nCut through the spinal column at the base of the animal’s neck using the bone scissors.\nRelease the skin of the back from the spinal column and ribs all the way down to the hips of the animal and cut through the spinal column just rostral to the Rectus Femoris muscles using the bone scissors.\nInsert one blade of the dissection scissors into the spinal column and carefully cut both sides of each vertebra to expose the spinal cord.\nNote: Carefully cut 1 vertebra at a time, always pointing the tip of the dissection scissors outwards, away from the spinal cord as damaging the spinal cord will make later steps much more difficult.\nQuickly douse the exposed spinal cord with ice-cold sterile saline before extraction.\nCarefully grip the rostral tip of the spinal cord with a pair of fine forceps (non-dominant hand) and lift gently until resistance is met. Carefully cut the root ganglia on either side stepwise with a pair of small dissection scissors (dominant hand) while gently lifting the spinal cord as it releases.\nCut the spinal cord right below the lumbar enlargement and transfer to the filter paper-covered chilled glass plate and douse again with ice-cold sterile saline.\nDiscard remains and surgical barrier sheet.\nFor central canal (CC) extraction (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1704-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

(IV) Isolation of CC and small amount of surrounding tissue from white and gray matter of the spinal cord. (V) Isolated CC (arrow). (VI) Dicing of CC tissue in preparation for dissociation for NSC isolation, same procedure for SVZ and SGZ tissues, all scale bars: ≈5.0 mm.\nCritical: Make sure the tissue remains chilled at all times by periodically dousing it in ice-cold sterile saline to improve cell survival.\nCut the spinal cord into 2–3 1 cm long pieces using a chilled and sterile razor blade.\nNote: Rest the spinal cord against the side of the forceps and let the razor blade gently cut through the spinal cord against the forceps. Do not compress the spinal cord as it will make later steps more difficult.\nUsing the bone scissors, gently cut of the white matter on either side of the piece of spinal cord (lateral sides, identify the dorsal side of the spinal cord by the large blood vein running down the midline).\nCut the white matter off the top of the spinal cord.\nNote: During these steps it is important to maintain orientation of the spinal cord and precision when cutting as the target area is very small and it can very quickly become difficult to see where to cut.\nGrab the gray matter containing the central canal with the fine forceps and carefully cut it off from the remaining ventral white matter of the spinal cord piece.",
    "Remove filter paper and place the piece of gray matter onto a clean part of the glass plate and dice thoroughly with a sterile and chilled razor blade, and transfer to the vial with ice-cold Neurobasal 1× with a graduated transfer pipette for transport and dissociation.\nRepeat the procedure for the remaining spinal cord sections (start with 1–2, expand to 2–3 when more experienced with the procedure), and transport tissue from all sections in the same 15 mL tube on ice.\nCritical: Make sure to clean the extracted tissue off white matter during the dissection. Pieces of white matter do not dissociate as easily and resulting clumps may get stuck in the pipette tip when aspirating. This will narrow the opening of the pipette tip, effectively increasing the pressure exerted on the cells during aspiration, resulting in a drastic reduction of cell survival.\nMain procedure: Tissue dissociation\nTiming: 45 min\nThis step describes the process of dissociating the tissue extracted through chemical digestion and mechanical dissociation. This process isolates the adult NSCs into a suspended single cell solution and initiates their expansion. Begin this step immediately after each dissection. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] may be useful. Adapted for use with all three other neurogenic niches from Dizon et al. (Dizon et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nSpin down the tissue at 100× g for 1 min at RT (20°C–23°C).\nIn a laminar flow cabinet, aspirate the transport media and resuspend the tissue in the same 15 mL tube using 5 mL ice-cold HBSS −/− using a serological pipette. Spin down the tissue at 100 × g for 1 min at RT (20°C–23°C).",
    "Note: To avoid loss of tissue at this stage the pellet should ideally be broken up using the force of the stream of the HBSS being added rather than through aspirations, as the tissue will tend to stick to any pipette tips and serological pipettes.\nRepeat steps 39–40 once.\nAspirate the HBSS and resuspend the tissue from 1 animal in 1 mL accutase for dissociating the CC -derived, SVZ -derived tissue or 1 mL trypsin for dissociating the SGZ-derived tissue (this should be at least at RT (20°C–23°C) when being added), breaking up the pellet with the stream of liquid.\nCritical: Both accutase and trypsin can be used for SVZ and SGZ dissociation, and the expected percentage of surviving cells directly following dissection and dissociation prior to proliferation is shown in Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]. Trypsin will increase proliferative potential in both compared to accutase (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A for representative number of cells after 20 days of proliferation) but may likely result in increased spontaneous glial-fated differentiation of SVZ-derived cells (see expected outcome: SVZ[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec4.2]). However, only accutase should be used for dissociating the CC-derived tissue as trypsin will severely impact NSC yields from this neurogenic niche (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nIncubate the tissue for 15 min (accutase) or 5 min (trypsin) in an incubator at 37°C. Following incubation, mechanically dissociate the tissue by repeatedly triturating the solution 500× using a p100 or p200 pipette set to 100 μL.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1704-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

The tip can be stabilized at the right height by holding the shaft of the pipette at the opening of the 15 mL tube with the same hand holding the tube.\nTransfer the dissociated tissue into a new 15 mL tube already containing 1 mL warm wash media.\nWash the lower part of the inside of the original tube using 1 mL warm Neurobasal 1× wash media and add this to the new tube to recover as many cells as possible.",
    "Add another 2 mL of Neurobasal 1× wash media for a final volume of 5 mL.\nNote: Do the washing of the old tube using the same tip used to transfer the cells to minimize loss of cells.\nSpin down the cells at 150 × g for 5 min at RT (20°C–23°C).\nAspirate the washing media and resuspend the pellet in 4 mL warm wash media and spin down the cells again at 150 × g for 5 min at RT (20°C–23°C).\nNote: For all washing steps, the cell pellet should be broken up using only the stream of media from a p1000 pipette set to 1000 μL, if at all possible, as the loss of cells tends to be substantial if repeated triturations are required, as they will stick to the plastic of the pipette tip.\nRepeat steps 45–46 once.\nDuring the wash steps, prepare a non-tissue culture-treated 6-well plate for seeding by adding 3.5 mL of culturing media to 1–3 wells and place the plate in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 37°C). Recommended seeding density is 5 × 105/well. Also, keep in mind that due to proliferation the number of wells should be doubled at P1.\nFollowing the second wash, remove the wash media and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL culturing media.\nCritical: Carry out the next steps quickly to ensure cell viability does not decrease.\nTake 10 μL of resuspended cell solution and add this to 10 μL of 0.4% Trypan Blue in a 500 μL Eppendorf. Mix gently but thoroughly by triturating 10× times and apply 10 μL to both sides of a cell counting chamber slide.",
    "Count the cells using an automatic cell counter (or other method of choice) and record the numbers from both sides of the chip. From the average of the two counts of live cells, determine the volume containing 5 × 105 cells.\nCalculation: Average of total number of live cells ÷ 1000 for number of live cells per μL of cell solution. 5 × 105 ÷ number of live cells/μL gives how many μL of cell solution contain 5 × 105 live cells.\nAdd the volume of cell suspension containing 5 × 105 live cells to each well in the 6-well plate prepared in step 51.\nPlace the plate in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 37°C) and leave undisturbed for 4 days.\nNote: For best results make sure that cells are evenly distributed throughout the wells. One option here is to gently swirl the plate, switching between clockwise and counterclockwise.\nCritical: Ensure that the tissue has been dissociated properly before performing cell counts, to obtain appropriate estimates of viable cells. This is particularly important for the CC dissociation as up to 90% of the live cells will die within the first few days leaving only the NSCs behind.\nNote: Presence of debris/dying cell will not notably impact NSC behavior but should be cleared away by washing the neurospheres during media changes and passages. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] may be useful.\nMain procedure: Media change\nTiming: 1–3 h (depending on number of cultures)\nThis stage describes the media changes, a critical main part of the maintenance process during the expansion phase of the experiment. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5] may be useful if problems with cell proliferation are encountered.",
    "Critical: In this protocol CHIR 99021 is used to prevent spontaneous differentiation (and subsequent cell death during dissociation) and increase proliferation in the SVZ-derived NSCs when grown as monolayer cultures (Pachenari et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]; Tang et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]). CHIR 99021 is not required for suspended NSC cultures as demonstrated by most other protocols. Do not add CHIR 99021 to CC-derived NSC cultures as this will induce differentiation (see expected outcomes: CC[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec4.1]). Paradoxically, adding CHIR 99021 to late-stage differentiating CC NSCs may induce de-differentiation to a more NSC/progenitor-like state and have been used for cell-to-stem cell reprogramming (Han et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Liu et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Tian et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]; Zhu et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]). CHIR 99021 is also critical for cell survival of the SGZ-derived NSCs monolayer cultures using this protocol (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B), however troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11] may also improve SGZ NSC viability beyond what is presented in this protocol.\nCritical: During P0 NSCs may form adherent cultures on the well bottom, and after P1 passage, all NSCs should form an adherent monolayer prior to the 1st media change. This will allow more cells to access nutrients, avoiding cell death from suffocation within neurospheres with minimal impact on NSC characteristics and behavior (Babu et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Conti and Cattaneo 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Miyazaki et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Mori et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]; Pollard et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]; Zheng et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]).",
    "Critical: Surface topography of culture vessel is of high importance to monolayer NSC survival and proliferation: The SVZ-derived NSCs will spontaneously differentiate and die on any surface that is not completely smooth (Example: non-tissue culture treated plates, key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). This can be mitigated to some degree by seeding NSCs on glass coverslips coated with Poly-L-Ornithine and Laminin solution (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). The SGZ-derived NSC monolayer cultures thrive best when they have a rough physical environment to attach to, drastically improving rate of proliferation (Example: tissue culture treated plates, key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), however, survival and proliferation is impacted on both coated and non-coated glass coverslips (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). The CC-derived NSCs are much more versatile in terms of surface topography and will thrive on both smooth and non-smooth surfaces, including coated and uncoated glass coverslips, however, smooth surfaces provide the highest rate of proliferation (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). Cell seeding density have also been shown to have an effect on NSC behavior on different culture vessel topographies (Cha et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nLeave the cells in the incubator for 4 days to expand following the dissociation before the 1st media change.\nPrepare media according to Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3], and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4] and pre-warm to 37°C in a water bath.\nUsing a 5 mL serological pipette, remove cell media from 1 well, triturate 2–3 times to wash off any adherent cells before transferring the media to an empty 15 mL tube. Triturate cell-containing media quickly 3–4 times to clean the neurospheres of any adherent cell debris.\nCritical: Avoid aspirating in air as that will damage and potentially kill cells.\nPipette 1 mL of fresh media into the well quickly, making sure any remaining cells are submerged, using the same 5 mL serological pipette as during step 56.\nRepeat the procedure for remaining wells on the same plate.",
    "Centrifuge the tube containing the cells at 150 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\nRemove supernatant and replace with 2 mL fresh media per well. Using a p1000 pipette, triturate 3–4 times to break up the pellet and return cells to their wells.\nNote: Triturate twice before reseeding each well, as the cells sink quickly, to maintain equal number of cells between the wells (there may be more cells in the last well reseeded if this is not done properly prior to seeding). To avoid bias in later cell counts all wells seeded from the same initial population need to be pooled and counted as one experimental unit for an accurate record of cell numbers and rate of proliferation.\nReturn plate to incubator.\nSuggested schedule: P0: Harvest cells on day 0, change media on days 4 and 7, passage to P1 on day 10. P1: Change media on days 13, 16 and 18 and passage to P2 on day 20.\nNote: For P1 and later generations: Keep an eye on media acidification (phenol red shifting to a yellow hue) as growth rate may require media changes more often (P2 may require changing every 18–12 h if expansion is continued beyond 20 DIV as rate of proliferation increases exponentially).\nMain procedure: Passaging\nTiming: 45–60 min (per passage)\nThis step describes the passaging of cultured NSCs for the purpose of breaking up suspended neurospheres and adherent monolayer colonies into single cell suspension to be reseeded for redistribution and avoiding cell death from being suffocating within the core of neurospheres and overgrown adherent 3D structures. If NSCs do not properly form monolayers after P1, troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] may be useful.\nIf there are suspended cells/neurospheres (relevant for P1 passage):",
    "Remove media with cells using a 5 mL serological pipette and transfer to empty 15 mL tube.\nVery carefully add 1 mL warm (37°C) Neurobasal 1× to the well to keep the attached cells hydrated, make sure not to dislodge any adherent cells when doing so.\nCentrifuge tube with cells at 150 × g for 5 min at room temperature.\n    Aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in dissociation agent (accutase/trypsin, 1 mL per well).\nCarefully remove the hydration media from each well, take care not to detach any adherent cells.\nTriturate dissociation agent with cells twice, aspirate and return 1 mL to each well and continue from step 68.\nIf there are no suspended cells/neurospheres:\nGently remove cell media and replace with 1 mL dissociation agent per well.\nContinued for both:\nIncubate the cells for 15 min (accutase) or 5 min (trypsin) in an incubator (5% CO2, 37°C). Following incubation, aspirate off the dissociation agent, and use it to wash the bottom of the well, collecting the cells in the bottom. Transfer all cells and dissociating agent to a 15 mL tube and mechanically dissociate the cells by triturating the solution 100× times using a p200 pipette for volumes =< 2 mL, or p1000 pipette for volumes > 2 mL, triturating approximately 20% of the total volume of liquid in the vial each time.\nNote: Avoid introducing bubbles during this step, to avoid this as well as shearing forces that could reduce viability if the pipette tip touches the very bottom of the tube while triturating. The tip can be stabilized at the right height by holding the shaft of the pipette at the opening of the 15 mL tube with the same hand holding the tube.",
    "Add 4 mL of warm Neurobasal 1× wash media to the tube (for 1 mL dissociating agent. Add 1 additional mL of wash media for every additional 1 mL of dissociation agent) to neutralize and wash out the dissociation agent (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] for issues when using trypsin).\nSpin down the cells at 150 × g for 5 min at RT (20°C–23°C).\nAspirate off the washing media and resuspend the pellet in 4 mL warm wash media and spin down the cells again at 150 × g for 5 min at RT (20°C–23°C).\nNote: For all washing steps, the cell pellet should be broken up using only the stream of media from a p1000 pipette set to 1000 μL, if at all possible, as the loss of cells tends to be substantial if aspirations are required, as they will stick to the plastic of the pipette tip.\nRepeat the washing step once more.\nDuring the wash steps, prepare 6-well culture plates (non-tissue culture-treated for the CC and SVZ-derived NSCs, and tissue adherence culture-treated plate for the SGZs-derived NSCs from P1 and onwards) for seeding by adding 3 mL of culturing media to the new wells and place the plate in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 37°C).\nFollowing the second wash, remove the wash media and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL culturing media.\nCritical: Carry out the next steps quickly to ensure cell viability does not decrease.\nTake 10 μL of resuspended cell solution and add this to 10 μL of 0.4% Trypan Blue in a 500 μL Eppendorf tube. Mix gently but thoroughly (about 10 aspirations) and apply 10 μL to both sides of a cell counting chamber slide.",
    "Count the cells using an automatic cell counter (or other method of choice) and record the numbers from both sides of the chip.\nCritical: Double the number of wells on each passage to give the cells space to expand. Seeding density should not exceed 5 × 106 cells per well.\nSplit the cell solution evenly between the new wells and return the plate to the humidified incubator (5% CO2, 37°C).\nNote: For best results make sure that cells are evenly distributed throughout the wells. One option here is to gently swirl the plate, switching between clockwise and counterclockwise directions a number of times.\nMain procedure: NSC characterization\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step presents a method for labeling and characterizing the cells resulting from the successful application of the protocol through EdU incorporation into the DNA of actively proliferating cells and immunocytochemical labeling for NSC and neural differentiation cell markers. We have chosen an array that tests for broadly recognized NSC characteristics (self-renewal and multipotency that should be applicable to NSCs from all three neurogenic niches. As the lateral SVZ NSCs primarily differentiate into neurons and astrocytes (Mizrak et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]) and SGZ-derived NSCs practically do not differentiate into oligodendrocytes in vivo (Wachs et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]), oligodendrogenesis was not tested for as a measure for multipotency beyond the expansion stage in vitro.\nDilute EdU in relevant cell media to a 1:500 dilution and replace 50% of cell media with EdU media solution, resulting in a final EdU solution of 1:1000 per well (10 μM/mL). Leave cells in EdU solution for the desired duration, 12–24 h recommended.\nFixation (30 min).\nRemove media and submerge cells in 3% glyoxal solution (Richter et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]) for 15 min (300 μL/well in 24 well plates, adjust volume to vessel used to ensure complete coverslip submersion).",
    "Remove Glyoxal solution and wash twice with 1× PBS for 5 min each, increasing volume of PBS by 100 μL for each wash.\nNote: If more than 1 plate is being processed, start timers once the first plate has been completed, not the last for more accurate times (Do this for all steps).\nThe immunostaining process can be started immediately after fixation, or the plates can be stored at 4°C for up to 3 weeks in 1× PBS, however the quality of the cells will start deteriorating after 1 week.\nImmunostaining (2 days).\nDay 1: Primary antibodies (20–24 h).\nRemove PBS from wash and replace with 0.5% Triton-X 100 in 1× PBS for 5 min.\nRemove Triton-X and wash twice for 5 min with 1× PBS, increasing volume of PBS for each wash.\nReplace PBS with 5% Goat Serum diluted in 1× PBS (blocking solution) and set aside for 1 h (300 μL/well is enough for 24 well plates). Prepare primary antibody solution in 5% goat serum at this time and store in fridge until needed.\nRemove goat serum blocking solution and submerge cells with primary antibody solution. Transfer plates into the cold room and place onto shaker table and leave overnight (18–22 h, at 4°C).\nNote: Always leave 1 well without primary antibodies for a primary antibody exclusion control.\nDay 2: Secondary antibodies and sample preservation (6 h).\nPrepare secondary antibodies (1:500 standard solution) in 5% goat serum in 1× PBS.\nCentrifuge secondary antibody solution at 2,000 × g for approx. 15 min, perform washing steps during this step.\nRemove primary antibody solution and wash with 1× PBS 3× times for 5 min each, increasing volume of PBS for each wash.",
    "Note: Always start each wash/step from here with the primary exclusion control and change tips between each solution and step (the more the better to avoid cross- contamination of antibodies. It is recommended to use a separate PBS and waste vial for the primary exclusion.\nRemove PBS and submerge cells in the secondary solution.\nPlace on a shaker table set to low speed and leave for 3 h, protected from light.\nTake out Prolong Gold Antifade mounting media at this time and leave to warm at room temperature.\nPrepare Hoechst solution (1:2000) in 1× PBS and protect from light during the last 30 min of the secondary incubation time.\nRemove secondary solution and submerge cells in the Hoechst solution for 30 min (300 μL/well).\nRemove Hoechst solution and wash 3× times with 1× PBS, increasing the volume of PBS for each wash.\nWash 1× additional time with MQ water. Remove MQ water and replace with new MQ water (700 μL/well for 24 well plate).\nPrepare cover slide, mark with date, sample type and secondary antibody wavelength.\nAdd a small drop of mounting media onto the cover slide. Remove coverslip from the well with fine forceps and dry by gently tapping one edge onto a sheet of tissue paper. Mount the coverslip by touching the mounting media with one side of the coverslip, then slowly lowering the other side, ensuring that no air bubbles are trapped under it.",
    "Note: Use Dumont 5/90 curved forceps to easier grab hold of the coverslips. Hold the plate at approximately 75°–80° so that the coverslip can rest in a standing position for ease of grabbing. Slowly lower the coverslip onto the mounting media, be careful not to get mounting media on top of the coverslip as this will introduce a lot of background and potentially ruin the sample. To ensure the coverslip is properly mounted (level), check it with a fluorescent microscope at low magnification (narrow/low numerical aperture recommended) for DAPI/Hoechst with the coverslip facing upwards, and adjust with forceps.\nLeave the coverslips to dry for 20–30 min, then gently seal the edge with clear nail varnish topcoat, ensuring minimal varnish on top of the coverslip.\nNote: Do not use nail polish and colored/matte nail polish as this will introduce a lot of background fluorescence.\nLet nail varnish dry for 15–20 min. Ensure that it is completely dry before handling further.\nNote: To check if mounting media/sealant is completely dry, gently touch with a filter paper where it does not cover the coverslip, and when no mark/indentation is left behind the sample is ready for imaging. Sealing with nail varnish is not required but will significantly extend the lifetime of the sample for future imaging, when the sample is stored at 4°C protected from light.\nMain procedure: Additional methods\nFreeze-Thaw of NSCs.\nFreezing and thawing of the NSCs follow established protocols and can be found elsewhere.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM).\nProtocols for preparing cells for imaging with SEM can be found elsewhere.\nDifferentiation of CC, SVZ and SGZ-derived NSCs (18+ days).",
