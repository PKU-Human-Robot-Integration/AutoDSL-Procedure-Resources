Schematic of passaging dfm1Δ+GALpr-Hmg-GFP cells to suppression\nDay 1\nThaw dfm1Δ-null yeast cells containing GALpr-Hmg2-GFP from freezer by streaking cells directly on SC-His plates.\nIncubate SC-His plate in 30°C incubator for ∼3 days.\nDay 4\nPrepare starter culture by inoculating a single colony into 3 mL of minimal media-His supplemented with 2% raffinose.\nCritical: Raffinose is used instead of dextrose to avoid repression of the GAL promoter.\nGrow starter culture overnight (16–20 h) until cells are grown to saturation (OD600>1).\nNote: dfm1Δ-null cells grow slower than wildtype cells. Wildtype growth rates typically have 90 min doubling time in glucose, 180 min doubling time in raffinose, and 150 min doubling time in galactose whereas dfm1Δ-null growth rates have 120 min doubling time in glucose, 240 min doubling time in raffinose, and 200 min doubling time in galactose.\nDay 5\nDilute cells to OD600 ∼0.1 in total volume of 3 mL of minimal media -His supplemented with 2% raffinose and incubate with rotation at 30°C for 4–5 h; allowing cells to double or grow to an early log-phase (OD600 ∼0.2–0.3). This culture is designated as Passage 0 (P0).\nFor strong expression of Hmg2-GFP under the control of the galactose-inducible promoter, once cells have grown to early log phase (OD600∼.3-.8), induce cells with the addition of galactose at a final concentration of 0.2% (v/v).\nIncubate at 30°C with rotation for ∼24 h or until cells are grown to saturation (OD600>1)\nDay 6",
    "Dilute cells to OD600 ∼0.1 in total volume of 3 mL of minimal media -His supplemented with 1.8% raffinose/0.2% galactose and incubate at 30°C with rotation for 24 h or until cells are grown to saturation (OD600>1). Designate this new culture as (P1).\nDay 6–21\nContinue passaging until dfm1Δ-null cells are completely suppressed (see major step below “Flow Cytometry to analyze for restored membrane substrate, Hmg2-GFP, degradation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2]” for details on how to analyze cells for suppression). We typically see complete suppression by P10.\nCritical: It is important to passage cells immediately after culture reach saturation phase. Sustained growth in saturation phase makes it difficult for cells to recover after dilution. Refer to troubleshooting section below.\nCritical: For growth, minimal medium is used rather than YPD to reduce background fluorescence which will not interfere with flow cytometry fluorescent readouts.\nFlow cytometry to analyze for restored membrane substrate, Hmg2-GFP, degradation\nTiming: [2–3 weeks]\nThis section outlines how Hmg2-GFP steady-state levels can be measured by flow cytometry throughout different passaging stages of dfm1Δ-null cells.\nControls and samples used:\nNon-induced control: cells are passaged continuously in the presence of glucose\nDegraded Hmg2 control: WT strains + GALpr-Hmg2-GFP are passaged in induced galactose condition. This is a control for what steady-state Hmg2 levels would be when undergoing ERAD degradation.\nStabilized Hmg2 control: cdc48-2 + GALpr-Hmg2-GFP passaged in induced galactose condition. This is a retrotranslocation-deficient control for what stabilized steady-state levels of Hmg2 would be.\nSample 1: P0 dfm1Δ + GALpr-Hmg2-GFP is non-passaged and non-suppressed sample, which should look like control #3.\nSample 2: passaged dfm1Δ + GALpr-Hmg2-GFP is suppressed strain, which should look like control #2.\nBiological triplicates were used for each strain and flow cytometry analysis was performed as technical triplicates.\nDay 1",
    "Thaw, inoculate, and passage dfm1Δ-null yeast cells containing GALpr-Hmg2-GFP as indicated above.\nFor P0 analysis of Hmg2-GFP levels: Once dfm1Δ-null yeast cells containing GALpr-Hmg2-GFP have been induced with galactose for at least two hours and grown to OD600∼0.4, take 300 μL of P0 cells and analyze for mean fluorescence levels using BD Biosciences FACS Calibur flow cytometer.\nAdjust the following settings before analyzing samples on flow cytometer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/775-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Run Settings: Run with Limits at 10,000 events. Fluidics: Medium flow rate for yeast.\n(B) Density plot displaying all events detected by flow cytometry. Gate 1 (in red) is drawn to isolate intact yeast cells, which is used for generating a histogram plot for mean fluorescence. Gate 2 (in purple) represents ruptured or damaged cells.\n(C) Entire cell population and Gate 1 cell population were used to generate histograms with the number of cells versus GFP fluorescence (FITC-A).\n(D)Analysis of nonsuppressed dfm1Δ cells (P0), passaged dfm1Δ cells (P4) and suppressed passaged dfm1Δ cells (P11) by flow cytometry. Mean fluorescence for P0 cells are ∼50K whereas suppressed P11 cells are ∼20 K. Histograms of 10,000 cells are shown, with the number cells versus GFP fluorescence.\nRun Settings: Run with limits, 10,000 events\nFluidics flow rate: Medium\nRun samples by aliquoting 300 μL of suspended cells into sample tubes and placing the tube on sample collector.\nData acquisition: For each run, create two plots: density (side scatter SSC vs. forward scatter FSC) and histogram plots (Cell Count vs. 530 filter for GFP FITC-A).",
    "Draw a gate around the population of intact yeast cells and display gated population as a histogram (Cell count vs. 530 filter for GFP FITC-A) to obtain the mean fluorescence of the gated population (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C).\nFor analysis of other passages, once cells are passaged and diluted in fresh minimal media, allow cells to double to OD600∼.4 and analyze for mean fluorescence via flow cytometer.\nCritical: Analyzing cells in saturated growth phase will yield large cellular debris and an abnormal distribution of fluorescence. Accordingly, it is important to analyze cells in the log-phase. Finally, all flow cytometry readings were performed directly from minimal media since it has negligible background fluorescence.\nSpot growth assay of non-suppressed and suppressed dfm1Δ-null cells\nTiming: [3–4 weeks]\nThis section outlines how spot growth assay can be utilized to demonstrate normal growth for suppressed dfm1Δ-null cells vs. a growth defect in non-suppressed dfm1Δ -null cells (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/775-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Schematic of spot assay used to analyze suppressed versus non-suppressed dfm1Δ+GALpr-HMG-GFP\nControls used\nNegative control: WT and cdc48-2 strains expressing both GALpr-Hmg2-GFP and empty vector.\nNegative control: dfm1Δ expressing empty vector.\nBiological triplicates were used for each strain and the growth assay was performed as technical triplicates.\nDay 1\nThaw dfm1Δ-null yeast cells containing GALpr-Hmg2-GFP from freezer by streaking on SC-His plates.\nIncubate SC-His plate in 30°C incubator for ∼3 days.\nDay 4\nFor growth analysis of P0 cells: Inoculate a single colony into 3 mL of minimal media supplemented with 2% raffinose. This culture is designated as Passage 0 (Passage 0).\nIncubate at 30°C with rotation overnight (16–20 h) until cells are grown to saturation (OD600>1).\nDay 5",
    "Dilute cells to OD600 ∼0.1 and incubate with rotation at 30°C for 4–5 h; allowing cells to double or grow to an early log-phase with OD600 ∼0.2–0.3.\nDay 6\nPellet 0.12 OD of cells by spinning at 14,000 × g for 2 min at room temperature and resuspending pellets in 1 mL of sterilized dH2O.\nTransfer 250 μL of each sample to a 96-well plate and perform a five-fold serial dilution in dH2O of each sample to obtain a gradient of 0.03–0.0000096 OD cells (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). 8. Pin the cells using the 8×12 pinning apparatus onto synthetic complete (-His) agar plates supplemented with 2% dextrose or 2% galactose.\nAir-dry the pinned droplets of cells under the flame in sterile conditions, seal the plates with parafilm and incubate at 30°C.\nNote: To make the droplets absorb faster and avoid droplet from running along the plate, it is important to pre-dry the plates with lids off in the Biosafety Cabinet or under a flame before spotting.\nRemove the plates from the incubator for imaging with the ChemiDoc Imager (Setting: UV-Trans) or a camera as an alternative on Day 3 and 7.\nFor growth analysis of suppressed passaged cells: Once cells have been validated for suppression by the flow cytometer, pellet 0.12 OD of cells and follow steps 5–10 (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/775-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Strongly expressed integral membrane substrates cause a growth defect in P0 non-suppressed dfm1Δ cells and restored growth in P11 suppressed dfm1Δ cells\nNon-passaged dfm1Δ cells (P0) or cells passaged to suppression (P11) were assessed for growth defect in the dilution assay by spotting 5-fold dilutions of cells on galactose-containing plates to drive Hmg2-GFP overexpression, and plates were incubated at 30°C.\nIn vivo retrotranslocation assay of suppressed and non-suppressed dfm1Δ-null cells\nTiming: [2–3 weeks]",
    "This section outlines how the in vivo retrotranslocation assay can demonstrate membrane substrate retrotranslocation deficiency for non-suppressed dfm1Δ -null cells vs. restored retrotranslocation in suppressed dfm1Δ-null cells (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/775-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Depiction of in vivo retrotranslocation assay for analyzing membrane-bound and retrotranslocated membrane substrate, Hmg2-GFP\nAdapted from (Neal et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nControls and Samples used:\nDegraded Hmg2 control: WT+ GALpr-Hmg2-GFP for retrotranslocation.\nStabilized Hmg2 control: cdc48-2+ GALpr-Hmg2-GFP for being retrotranslocation-deficient.\nSample 1: P0 dfm1Δ + GALpr-Hmg2-GFP is non-passaged and non-suppressed sample, which should look like control #2.\nSample 2: passaged dfm1Δ + GALpr-Hmg2-GFP is suppressed strain, which should look like control #1.\nBiological replicates were used for each strain and the in vivo assay was performed as technical triplicates.\nDay 1:\nThaw dfm1Δ-null yeast cells containing GALpr-Hmg2-GFP from freezer by streaking directly on SC-His plates.\nIncubate SC-His plate in 30°C incubator for ∼3 days.\nDay 4:\nInoculate a single colony into 10 mL of minimal media supplemented with 2% raffinose. This culture is designated as Passage 0 (Passage 0).\nIncubate at 30°C with rotation overnight (16–20 h) until cells are grown to saturation (OD600>1).\nDay 5:\nDilute cells to OD600 ∼0.1 in fresh minimal media supplemented with 2% raffinose (total volume= 50 mL in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask) and incubate with shaking at 30°C for 4 h; allowing cells to double or grow to an early log-phase (OD600 ∼0.2–0.3).\nOnce cells have grown to early-log phase (OD600∼0.2–0.3), remove 3 mL of cells suspension and add to culture tube. Continue passaging cells as outlined in major step above “Culturing and passaging dfm1Δ-null +GALpr-Hmg2-GFP cells to suppression” (Steps 6–8) until cells are completely suppressed.",
    "Non-suppressed, non-passaged cells: For the rest of the culture (∼47 mL), add MG132 at a final concentration of 25 μg/mL and incubate for 1 h with shaking for 2 h.\nNote: MG132 is a proteasome inhibitor that allows for accumulation of retrotranslocated HMG2 in cytosol and easier detection on western blot. We typically obtain efficient inhibition by MG132 with 1–2 hours of incubation.\nAfter incubation with MG132 pellet 15 OD of cells in 50 mL falcon tubes by centrifuging at 1,000 × g for 5 min in room temperature.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend the pellets in sterile deionized water and centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 5 min in room temperature.\nPause point: At this point, cells can be stored in −80°C freezer and for future use until suppressed passaged cells are ready for analysis in the retrotranslocation assay.\nPassaged suppressed cells: Once cells are suppressed through continued galactose induction during passaging, dilute cells to OD600 ∼0.1 in fresh minimal media supplemented with 1.8% raffinose/ 0.2% galactose (total volume= 50 mL in 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask) and incubate with shaking at 30°C for 4 h; allowing cells to double or grow to an early log-phase (OD600 ∼0.2–0.3). Follow steps 43–45.\nResuspend passaged and non-passaged cell pellets in 400 μL of sterile deionized water and prepared for bead lysis by dividing samples into 4×2 mL Eppendorf tubes (∼100 μL of cell suspension per tube). Spin tubes at 10,000 × g rpm for 2 min at room temperature and aspirate supernatant.\nResuspend each pellet with 100 μL of MF buffer supplemented with the following protease inhibitors 1 mM PMSF, 260 μM AEBSF, 100 μM leupeptin, 76 μM pepstatin, 5 mM aminocaproic acid, 5 mM benzamidine, and 142 μM TPCK.\nNote: phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) is prepared fresh for each experiment.",
    "Add 0.5 mM silicone beads to meniscus of cell suspension. Vortex samples on multi-vortexer set at top speed for 6 × 1-min intervals with 10 min intervals on ice between each vortexing.\nCheck cells under the microscope (20 × magnification) for lysis efficiency.\nNote: Lysed cells are distinguishable by their fragmented shape and for optimal yield it is critical to achieve ∼80–90% lysis efficiency. See troubleshooting section below for more details on lysing.\nCritical: At the point, samples and all solutions should be kept on ice.\nAdd 100 μL of chilled MF buffer with PIs to each eppendorf tube and combine lysates by transferring to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with a 1 mL pipette. Centrifuge at 2,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C to remove cell debris.\nTransfer clarified supernatant to ultracentrifugation tube.\nUltracentrifuge the clarified lysate at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C to separate the pellet microsome fraction (P) and cytosolic supernatant fraction (S).\nResuspend pellet in 200 μL SUME buffer with PIs and NEM.\nAdd 600 μL of IPB with PIs and NEM to the (S) fraction and resuspended (P) fraction.\nFor immunoprecipitation of Hmg2-GFP add 15 μL of rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antisera to the (P) and (S) samples.\nIncubate the samples on ice for 5 min, spin at 14,000 × g for 5 min, and remove the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL eppendorf tube and incubate overnight with gentle mixing using a nutator at 4°C.\nNote: For equilibrating Protein A-Sepharose, do this before you begin the retrotranslocation assay:",
    "Add Protein-A Sepharose to 50 mL Falcon tube. Fill tubes with ∼40 mL of deionized water and place tube on ice. Once beads settle to the bottom, carefully pour out water (it is ok to leave residual water). Repeat these 6 times with deionized water. After final rinse with water, add 6 mL of IPB. This solution is suitable for storage at 4°C for future use.\nAdd 100 μL of equilibrated Protein A-Sepharose to the samples and incubate for 2 h at 4°C with gentle mixing using a nutator.\nWash Protein A-Sepharose beads twice by adding 900 μL of IPB followed by brief spin of 1,000 × g for 30 s at room temperature and aspirating supernatant with an 18-gauge syringe needle. Repeat again with addition of IPB to beads.\nWash beads once more by adding 900 μL of IPW followed by brief spin of 1,000 × g for 30 s at room temperature and aspirating beads to dryness using a 30-gauge syringe needle.\nResuspend beads in 60 μL of 2× urea sample buffer and solubilize samples by incubating at 55°C for 10 min.\nSpin samples at 14,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature. The eluted proteins are removed to a new tube.\nEluted proteins are resolved by SDS-PAGE using 8% gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting at 15 mAmp for 15 min using a TransBlot.\nImmunoblot with monoclonal anti-ubiquitin (1:4,000 dilution) anti-GFP (1:10,000 dilution) along with Goat anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) recognized the primary antibodies.
