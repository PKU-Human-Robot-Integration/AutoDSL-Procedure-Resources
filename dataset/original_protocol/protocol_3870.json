    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe overall procedure is outlined in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/783-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Scheme of Mr BMT\nFirst, PLX5622-formulated diet is administered for two weeks to create a microglia-empty niche in the CNS of recipient. After that, a 9 Gy whole-body irradiation is applied, followed by the bone marrow transplantation immediately. Then, replace the PLX5622-formulated diet by the control diet for 30 days.\nWBI: whole-body irradiation; BMT: bone marrow transplantation; PLX5622: PLX5622-formulated AIN-76A diet; CD: control AIN-76A diet.\nMicroglial depletion\nTiming: 14 days\nThis procedure achieves efficient microglial depletion (usually > 99% in the brain cortex and 100% in the retina) in the CNS of the adult recipient mouse with the CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622 (Huang et al., 2018a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Huang et al., 2018b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Xu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). We usually used 1.5- to 4-month-old mice as the recipient in our experiments. Both males and females are applicable. Notably, the donor cell should come from the gender-matched animal.\nFeed the C57BL/6J recipient mouse with PLX5622-formulated chow diet ad libitum from D0 to D14.\nRefill the PLX5622-formulated chow every three days.\nBefore the lethal irradiation, treat the mouse with neomycin (1.1 g/L) containing acid water (pH 2 to 3) ad libitum from D11 to D28. The acid water prevents most bacterial contaminations (Duran-Struuck and Dysko, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).",
    "Critical: According to our experience, at the specific pathogen free (SPF) animal facility, more than 95% of microglia in the brain cortex and 100% of retinal microglia in the otter plexiform layer (OPL) are able to be ablated at day 7 of PLX5622 administration. At day 14, more than 99% of brain microglia in the cortex and all retinal microglia are ablated (Huang et al., 2018a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Huang et al., 2018b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). In contrast, microglial depletion efficiency will be dampened in a non-SFP animal facility. The efficiency of microglial depletion is critical for the replacement efficiency. We strongly recommend a 14-day microglial depletion.\nCritical: The animals should be kept at a specific pathogen-free (SPF) animal facility. Otherwise, the microglial depletion efficiency is relatively low in the “dirty environment”, which will influence the replacement efficiency.\nConditioning of the recipient mouse by X-ray lethal irradiation\nTiming: 4 h\nChange the PLX5622-formulated chow with sterilized AIN-76A control diet (CD) 2–3 h before the lethal irradiation at D14.\nCut a piece of sterilized foam plastic pad that can fit into an open mouse cage. Put the recipient mice in an open cage. Put the foam plastic piece over the cage and press down so that the mice will only be able to crawl on the floor of the cage (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/783-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The design of foam plastic pad\n(A) A regular mouse cage for the irradiator, please refer to the manual of the irradiator.\n(B) 1–10 mice can be included in the cage.\n(C) Cut a piece of foam pad to fit into the cage. Stab some hole in pad for venticulation of the cage.\n(D) Make sure that the foam fit the cage, to prevent the mice from escaping from the cage.",
    "(E) The foam pad should be inserted low enough so that the space between the foam pad and the cage can restrain the mice from standing up.\nSet the irradiation dosage to 9 Gy on the X-ray irradiator (Radsource, RS-2000). Put the mouse cage in the irradiator and initiate irradiation.\nNote: The irradiation duration depends on the power of the irradiator. Typically, the irradiation time is 5–10 min. Usually, no more than 10 mice are irradiated at one time.\nCritical: Please make sure the irradiation is X-ray. We found that the replacement efficiency by Gamma-ray is quite low.\nAfter the irradiation, remove the covering foam plastic piece from the cage. Feed the irradiated mouse with sterilized CD and neomycin containing acid water (1.1 g/L, pH 2 to 3) ad libitum.\nBone marrow transplantation\nTiming: 1 h (one donor and five recipients)\nThis procedure applies the bone marrow transplantation to the microglia-depleted mouse.\nIsolation of bone marrow cells from the gender-matched donor CX3CR1+/GFP mouse. We usually used 1.5- to 4-month-old mice as the donor in our experiments.\nPrepare ice cold 1× PBS in three 35 mm Petri dishes. Put a 100 μm cell strainer into a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Prewet the strainer with PBS in advance.\nDeeply anesthetize the CX3CR1+/GFP donor mouse with ketamine (100 mg/kg, dissolved in saline) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, dissolved in saline) by intraperitoneal injection. Dislocate the cervical spine of the donor mouse after loss of the toe reflex.\nIsolate the femurs, tibias and humerus (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Clean up soft tissues from the bones with Kim Wipes. Put the cleaned bones in one of the dishes containing ice cold PBS. Wash the bones three times to remove attached soft tissue and furs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/783-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Bone marrow isolation by flushing",
    "After isolating the femurs, tibias and humerus (A), cut off both ends of the bones (B). Insert the syringe needle into one end of the bone (C), and flush out the bone marrow into the cell strainer (D). Bone marrow can be seen as red pieces in panel D.\nCut off both ends of the bones (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Fill in a 5 mL syringe up with ice cold PBS with a 21 G needle. After removal of trapped bubbles, insert the needle into one end of the bone (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). Flush out the bone marrow into the cell strainer (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nRepeat Step 8d until all bones are processed. Next, triturate the bone marrow piece with 1 mL pipette for 10 times. Pour the triturated bone marrow cells into the cell strainer.\nGrind the remaining bone marrow against the strainer with the plunger from the syringe until no obvious pieces of bone marrow can be found (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Wash the strainer with 2 mL ice cold PBS.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/783-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Use a plunger to grind the large pieces of bone marrow\nCentrifuge at 4°C 300 g for 5 min. Red cell pellets containing bone marrow cells and red blood cells will be at the bottom of the centrifuge tube (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A). Discard the supernatant carefully.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/783-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Comparison of bone marrow cell pellets before and after red blood cell lysis\n(A) The cell pellets before blood cell lysis is red.\n(B) It turns white after ACK lysis buffer treatment.\nRemove the red blood cells by adding 1 mL ACK lysis buffer at room temperature (approximately 20°C–25°C) for 1 min. Then, add 9 mL ice cold PBS to the cell suspension and mix gently.",
    "Centrifuge at 4°C 300 g for 5 min. White cell pellets containing bone marrow cells will appear on the bottom of the centrifuge tube (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nDiscard the supernatant. Resuspend the pellets with appropriate amount of PBS (550 μL per donor mice).\nPut the cell suspension on ice. Count the cell number using hemacytometers as follows:\nAdd 10 μL of the cell suspension to the hemocytometer.\nCount the total cell numbers in the central grid and grids of the four corners. Calculate the average cell number.\nMultiply the average cell number by 104 to estimate the number of cells per microliter.\nNote: Typically, about 5 × 107 bone marrow cells are able to be collected from one donor mouse. To achieve efficient replacement, at least 1 × 107 cells in 100 μL PBS are recommended to be transplanted into one recipient. Thus, bone marrow cells harvested from one donor mouse can be transplanted to up to 5 recipients. If one recipient is injected with 100 μL donor cells, then the maximum amount of PBS reconstituting the donor cell pellet from one mouse is about 550 μL (50 μL for aspiration error).\nBone marrow transplantation\nPlace the C57BL/6J recipient mouse into the restraining tube carefully. Insert face-mask plug into the restraining tube so that the mouse cannot move but can still breathe easily. Tighten the screw on the plug (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCritical: Tightly restrain the recipient mouse avoiding suppressing its breath (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nAspire 100 μL donor cells into a 29 G syringe without trapped bubbles.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/783-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Restraing mouse in the restraining tube for tail vein injection\nThe recipient mouse must be tightly restrained (A), but can still breathe (B).",
    "Straighten the tail of the mouse; locate the tail vein about 2 cm from tail tips as the injection site with the help of an orange LED light placed beneath the tail (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]; Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/783-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Using a mini-LED to help locate the tail vein.\nNote: There are three veins in the tail. Choose the most accessible one. We usually choose the one of the side tail veins.\nInsert half of the needle bevel into the injection site with an angle of about 30° to the tail, then parallelly insert about 1 mm of the needle into the tail vein (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nNote: The tail vein is “enlarged” after insertion of the needle with the help of LED light illumination.\nSlowly inject the cells into the vein. Press the injection site and withdraw the needle. Keep pressing the injection site while releasing the mouse from the restrainer with the mouse tail still in the operator’s hand. After releasing the mice, press the injection site for another 20 s (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). See Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5].\nFeed the transplanted mouse with sterilized CD for recovery of 30 days ad libitum. Meanwhile, the mouse is treated by neomycin containing acid water (1.1 g/L, pH 2 to 3) for the first 2–3 weeks after transplantation. Then, the endogenous microglia are replaced by CX3CR1GFP/+ Mr BMT cells.\nNote: We usually conducted the bone marrow cell transplantation within 3 hours post irradiation.\nNote: Though we did not systematically test the recovery day shorter than 30 days, the replacement was not sufficient at day 21 post transplantation as we observed from one signal case.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.
