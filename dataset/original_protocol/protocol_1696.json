Recombinant L. monocytogenes expressing a full length of ovalbumin protein are named LmOVA. Through T cell receptor-specific recognition of ovalbumin peptide residues 257–264 (OVA257-264), LmOVA is able to induce the conversion of a fraction of CD8+ T cells into antigen-specific cells (Yang et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nHere, mice are immunized with LmOVA for 7 days. Splenocytes are isolated and stained with antibody to detect the CD8+ T cells which specific response to OVA and the cytokine production. The Scheme of this experiment is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1281-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Bottom panel: Spleens of mice treated with PBS (-).\nPreparation of LmOVA before mice immunization\nSpin down 5 × 105 CFU of LmOVA bacteria (per mouse) at 3000 g for 10 min at 25°C.\nWash LmOVA twice with 1 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuge at 3000 g for 10 min at 25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nResuspend the LmOVA precipitate with 100 μL PBS.

    "Obtain organs On day 7, use CO2 for mice euthanasia and collect spleens and livers (in general, bigger spleens are observed if the corresponding mice are infected with LmOVA (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E). The surgical procedure to harvest the organs is as follows.\nMice treatment with CO2 for euthanasia.\nMice are sprayed with 75% ethanol. This step will reduce the probability of the cells being contaminated by bacteria.\nSpleen collection (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C):\nPlace the mouse on its side with one of its limbs facing outward.\nUse forceps and surgical scissors to cut a small incision in the outer epidermis of the mouse, as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C.\nUse the new forceps and surgical scissors to make a small incision in the inner epidermis of the mouse.\nCut gastro-splenic ligament with surgical scissors and forceps to separate the spleen from the stomach.\nPut the spleen in a 6-well cell culture dish with 2 mL PBS for next step.\nLiver collection (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D):\nPlace the mouse on ventral surface as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and secure limbs using needles.\nUse forceps and surgical scissors to cut abdominal outer epidermis of mouse.\nUse the new forceps and surgical scissors to make an incision in the diaphragm of the mouse.\nCarefully separate the liver from the diaphragm.\nPut the liver in a 6-well cell culture dish with 2 mL PBS for next step.\nPreparation of the splenocytes\nTiming: 25 min\nPlace a 70 μm cell strainer on a 50 mL tube.\nPut a mouse spleen on the 70-μm cell strainer and homogenize using the rubber end of a syringe with 2 mL PBS.\nFlush and wash the strainer with another 2 mL PBS.\nSpin down the spleen homogenate at 400 g at 4°C for 10 min.",

Two-tailed Student’s t test; ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001.\nAdoptive transfer of OT-I CD8+ T cells to CD45.1 mice followed by immunization with LmOVA\nWe use an OT-I and CD45.1 mice adoptive transfer model to evaluate OT-I CD8+ T cell immune responses to LmOVA challenge. OT-I mice have transgenic inserts for mouse Tcra-V2 and Tcrb-V5 genes designed to recognize the OVA257–264 peptide. These mice are commonly used as a model immunological system for studying CD8+ T cell response to antigen (Clarke et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Hogquist et al., 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). CD45.1 mice are C57BL/6 congenic strain and widely used in adoptive transfer studies to track the donor and recipient cells. These mice carry the differential leukocyte marker commonly known as CD45.1, which are distinguish with C57BL/6(CD45.2) mice (Geiger et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPurified OT-1 CD8+ T cells are adoptively transferred to CD45.1 mice and then the recipient mice are infected with LmOVA. The Scheme of this experiment is shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1281-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "Repeat “xi” twice.\nPick up the magnet, and in one continuous motion invert the magnet and tube, pouring off the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells (OT-I CD8+ T cells) with a suitable volume of PBS.\nNote: The purity of these cells can reach 90%–95%. Purity can be checked by FACS when using the isolation kit for the first time. In general, approximately 2–5∗106 CD8+ T cells can be obtained from the spleen of a 6–8 week old male mouse.\nCritical: All procedures below are carried out in sterile conditions.\nOT-I CD8+ T cell transfer\nTiming: 7 days\nTransplant OT-I CD8+ T cells (CD45.2+; 5 × 105 cells in 100 μL PBS/per mouse) into CD45.1+ mice by tail-vein injection.\nThe next day, intravenously inject 5 × 105 CFU LmOVA into each CD45.1 mouse (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\n7 days later, collect the CD45.1 mouse spleen.\nPlace a 70 μm-cell strainer on a 50 mL centrifuge tube.
