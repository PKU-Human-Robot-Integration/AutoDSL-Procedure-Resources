Implantation of a cranial window requires\n      approximately 1 h.\n    \n        Pre-surgical preparation of the animal.\n        \n            Place the animal into the induction chamber with 4% isoflurane in\n            oxygen or medical air.\n          \nShave the surgical area.\n            Transition the animal to the stereotactic frame. Hook the teeth into\n            the hole in the incisor bar and fix the ear bars in place.\n          \nCheck head stability.\n            Maintain anesthesia at an isoflurane level of 2%–2.5% in oxygen or\n            medical air, delivered continuously through a nose cone.\n          \n            Monitor isoflurane level throughout the experiment to maintain depth\n            of anesthesia. Confirm depth of anesthesia with stable breathing and\n            absence of a pedal reflex.\n          \n        Use a homeothermic closed loop monitoring system to maintain the\n        animal’s body temperature at 37.5 degrees throughout the experiment.\n      \nCover the animal with cotton wool to maintain body temperature.\n        Give analgesics.\n        \n            Subcutaneous injection of meloxicam 5 μg/g under the dorsal\n            skin on the back.\n          \n            Subcutaneous injection of bupivicaine/epinephrine 4 μg/g\n            locally under the skin on top of the head.\n          \nRecord time of drug administration.\nApply eye ointment.\nNote: This prevents dehydration of the\n      eyes and is also anti-inflammatory.\n    \n        Swab surgical area with iodine in a triangular shape from between the\n        eyes to between the ears.\n      \nApply liquid plaster on top of the iodine and allow to dry.\nNote: This keeps any remaining hair\n      together and prevents contamination within the surgical plane.\n    \n        Remove a section of skin on top of the head.\n        \n            Pinch the skin between the eyes with forceps and make an incision\n            using scissors.\n          \n            Insert scissors into opening and cut a triangular flap of skin to\n            expose the scalp.\n          \nMake sure not to damage the lateral muscles.",
    "Remove the periosteum using sterilized cotton buds, forceps and scissors\n        to fully expose the bone.\n      \n        Secure the wound margin with 3M Vetbond Tissue Adhesive (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3122-Fig3.jpg\n              Figure 3. Stages of surgery for cranial window implantation\n            \n              The perimeter around the removed skin is secured to the bone using\n              3M Vetbond Tissue Adhesive and a 3 mm biopsy punch (A) is used to\n              gently engrave the outline of a craniotomy on the skull (B). A\n              high-speed micro drill is used to lightly drill around the\n              perimeter of the engraving to make the craniotomy region clear\n              (C). Following mounting of the head plate using dental cement the\n              bone is carefully drilled until sufficiently thin (D). A\n              sterilized suture is secured to the bone that will be removed\n              using a small amount of dental cement (E). This is allowed to set\n              with each end of the suture on either side (F). The suture is\n              pulled up gently at both sides to remove the bone flap and expose\n              the brain in a controlled and delicate manner (G). The cranial\n              window is secured in place using 3M Vetbond Tissue Adhesive,\n              followed by clear dental cement (H). See\n              Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] for a movie of animals with cranial\n              windows implanted.\n            \n        Use a 3 mm biopsy punch to gently engrave the outline of the craniotomy\n        onto the skull (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\n      \n        Lightly drill around the perimeter of the engraving so that the outline\n        of the craniotomy is clear (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\n      \n        Secure the head plate in place using dental cement (see\n        Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for placement).\n        \n            Compose dental cement according to manufacturer’s instructions.\n          \n            Position the large circular gap in the center of the head plate\n            above the region where the craniotomy will be.\n          \n            The head plate should be slightly angled to match the curvature of\n            the skull.",
    "Hold the head plate in the correct orientation until the dental\n            cement is dry.\n          \n        Gently thin the bone around the craniotomy region detailed in steps 11\n        and 12 using a high-speed micro drill set at approximately 14,000 rpm,\n        whilst continuously moving in a circular motion to avoid local heating\n        of the tissue (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\n        \n            There are blood vessels in the bone so there may occasionally be a\n            little bleeding.\n          \n            Remove bone debris using compressed air regularly to keep the area\n            clear and visible for drilling.\n          \n            Whilst drilling, soak the area with saline intermittently to help\n            prevent heat damage.\n          \nSerially assess the thickness of remaining bone.\n        Remove the bone flap.\n        \n            Check that the drilled bone has been thinned sufficiently by\n            pressing down very gently at the center of the circular piece of\n            bone to be removed using forceps. Adequately thinned bone will\n            become translucent under saline making the vasculature visible.\n          \n            Use a drop of dental cement to secure a sterile suture to the\n            circular piece of bone that will be removed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). Allow to dry whilst soaking the surrounding drilled bone with\n            saline (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\n          \n            Very gently raise the bone flap away holding the suture tightly at\n            both sides to ensure that it comes off in a single piece.\n            \nNote: Apply equal pressure on\n              either side of the suture to ensure clean removal and avoid damage\n              to the brain.\n            \n            The bone flap can also be removed using Pierse fixation forceps. The\n            gap between the bone and the dura mater is very small in mice so\n            great care needs to be taken not to penetrate below the bone margin\n            and the bone needs to be grasped firmly.\n            \nNote: Previous protocols have\n              utilized a removal technique using forceps, however the suture\n              method described here is an optimization for this surgical\n              procedure.",
    "Following bone removal soak the exposed brain dura with saline (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\n          \n        Secure the cranial window in place (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).\n        \n            Place a cranial window above the craniotomy with the 3 mm window at\n            the bottom whilst saline is still on top of the brain.\n          \n            Lower the window gently using forceps so that the 3 mm window fills\n            the 3 mm craniotomy and the 4 mm window sits on top.\n            Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] illustrates positioning of the window\n            on the skull.\n          \n            Remove saline from bone to the margin of the cranial window using\n            eye spears.\n          \n            Place a drop of 3M Vetbond Tissue Adhesive close to the window but\n            not over the opening. Use eye spears to carefully surround the\n            window whilst holding it firmly in place and ensure that the glue\n            does not seep underneath the window.\n          \n            Once this has partially dried, use a small amount of clear dental\n            cement to further secure the window around the perimeter.\n            \nNote: Be aware that dental cement\n              viscosity changes over time and therefore can flow on top of the\n              brain if sufficient care is not taken.\n            \n            Hold the window in place for several minutes until sufficiently\n            dried.\n            \nNote: The cranial window should be\n              parallel to both the brain surface and the head plate to ensure\n              imaging at the same focal plane throughout the cranial window.\n            \n        Inject the animal with 0.5 mL of saline subcutaneously to rehydrate.\n      \n        Put animal into the recovery cage with an appropriate post-surgical diet\n        e.g., wet mash and monitor recovery until the animal is fit for return\n        to housing.\n      \n        Complete the relevant documentation according to local animal\n        regulations.\n      \n        In our studies animals are left for 2 weeks following implantation of\n        cranial windows before imaging.\n      \nNote: Acute experiments can be conducted\n      where animals are imaged immediately after surgery or at other time points",

    "Within the LAS X software, configure the imaging parameters as follows:\n        \n            Multiphoton excitation using the MaiTai (Spectra-Physics) MP laser\n            tuned to 800 nm with emitted signal imaged simultaneously onto\n            external ND-HyD’s through BP525/50 (for Alexa Fluor 488) and\n            BP624/40 (for Texas red) filters.\n          \n            Also acquire regions with the MaiTai MP laser also tuned to 880 nm\n            and emitted signals imaged onto an additional ND-HyD through a\n            BP440/20 filter.\n          \nNote: This enables imaging of the highly\n      organized collagen fibers of the dura, via backscattered second harmonic\n      generation (SHG).\n    \nNote: It is important to differentiate\n      between cortical and meningeal vessels as these can have different\n      properties. See Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3] which shows a Z stack using\n      SHG to detect the dura and red dextran to label the bloodstream.\n    \nCAUTION: The multiphoton lasers are\n      high powered and often invisible. They can be damaging to the eyes so\n      should only be switched on when the animal and imaging area are completely\n      covered.\n    \n        Select live.
