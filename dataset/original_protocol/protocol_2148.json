Here, we discuss how to measure receptor plasma membrane density at steady states (i.e., in the absence of receptor activation or inhibition) by cs-ELISA.\nEGFR labeling\nTiming: 2 h\nEGFR is labeled with a primary Ab followed with an HRP-conjugated F(ab’)2 secondary Ab. EGFR cell surface density is measured by the fluorescence generated by the addition of Amplex Red reagent.\n48 h after cell seeding:\nWash cells once with pre-warmed PBS++ at 37°C.\nStarve cells for 2 h in pre-warmed 0.5% FBS-DMEM media (0.5 mL/well) at 37°C. Serum-starvation induces cellular stress responses and accumulate receptors at the plasma membrane.\nAfter starvation, cells should be assessed by a light microscope if they are in good condition, then the plate is placed on ice for 5–10 min to impede receptor internalization. The next steps are all performed on ice.\nAdd 300 μL/well of EGFR primary Ab diluted 1:1000 (i.e., a final Ab concentration of 1 μg/mL) in ice cold 0.5% BSA/PBS++ and incubate for 1 h on ice.\nAs a background signal control, an IgG isotype control should be used (same dilution as the primary Ab is prepared).\nWash cells 3 times with ice cold PBS++ (500 μL/well). All washes should be done gently and quickly to avoid cell detachment and wells from getting dry. It is recommended to use an aspirator.\nAdd 300 μL/well of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated F(ab’)2 secondary Ab diluted 1:1500 (i.e., a final Ab concentration of 1 μg/mL) in ice cold 0.5% BSA/PBS++ and incubate for 1 h on ice.",
    "F(ab’)2 secondary Ab is used to avoid non-specific interactions of the Ab Fc portion with cell surface proteins.\nWash cells at least 4 times with ice cold PBS++ (500 μL/well).\nFluorescence measurement\nTiming: 15 min/24-well plate\nAmplex Red reagent is a highly sensitive probe for H2O2. In the presence of HRP, Amplex Red reacts with H2O2 to produce highly fluorescent resorufin. This facilitates the measurement of receptor plasma membrane density in live cells.\nPrepare Amplex Red reagent dilution as follows (for 10 mL): 9.85 mL ice cold 1× PBS, 50 μL of 10 mM stock Amplex Red reagent and 100 μL of 20 mM H2O2.\nPrepare 10 mM stock Amplex Red reagent according to manufacturer’s instructions, aliquot and store at −20°C protected from light.\nTo prepare 20 mM H2O2 working solution: dilute 3% H2O2 stock solution in the appropriate volume of dH2O (i.e., 1 mL 20 mM H2O2= 23 μL of 3% H2O2 + 977 μL of dH2O).\nAdd 300 μL/well of the prepared Amplex Red reagent dilution and incubate for 10 min on ice. The plate should be protected from light.\nAfter incubation, transfer 200 μL of the added Amplex Red to a 96 well BLACK plate (Corning 96-Well Solid Black Polystyrene Microplates).\nIt is important to transfer all the quadruplets to the 96 well BLACK plate exactly after 10 min of incubation with Amplex Red reagent. For that, allow one minute difference between quadruplets once Amplex Red reagent is added in step 8 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1732-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic representation on how to add and remove Amplex Red reagent for equal incubation times among the different samples being tested and for an accurate signal quantification\nCell surface receptor density is measured by detecting Amplex Red fluorescence intensity (590 nm) using a fluorescence plate reader (Tecan).",
    "In case of a high background signal (IgG control wells), increase washes to 6 times after secondary Ab incubation and add Amplex Red reagent again.\nThe average signal from IgG wells (i.e., the background signal) should be subtracted from the signal of each well labeled for EGFR (i.e., from NT and shESCRT wells) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nMeasuring EGFR plasma membrane stability by cs-ELISA\nReceptor plasma membrane stability is the measure of cell surface receptor density after a stimulatory or inhibitory signal (e.g., activating EGFR with EGF or inhibiting it with Gefitinib). Receptor plasma membrane stability is regulated by several factors, such as ligand concentration, rate of receptor internalization and recycling. Here, we discuss how to measure EGFR plasma membrane stability following EGF stimulation.\nCell seeding\nTiming: 48 h\nSame as seeding for cell surface receptor density measurement. However, to measure receptor plasma membrane stability, NT control and ESCRT-depleted HeLa cells should be seeded in two 24-well plates: one plate to be stimulated with EGF and the second is unstimulated.\nEGF stimulation\nTiming: 20 min\n48 h after cell seeding, starve cells for 2 h in 0.5% FBS-DMEM pre-warmed media at 37°C. After starvation, one plate is stimulated with EGF (50 ng/mL prepared in 0.5% FBS-DMEM media) for 20 min at 37°C, whereas the second plate is left unstimulated. The 20 min EGF stimulation is sufficient to deliver EGFR towards the endo-lysosomal compartment, however upon ESCRT depletion EGFR trafficking is disrupted and its plasma membrane stability is affected (Kazan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nAfter EGF stimulation, the two plates are washed twice with PBS++ and placed on ice for 5–10 min to impede receptor internalization (keep PBS++ in wells).\nReceptor labeling\nSame as described for cell surface density measurement.\nFluorescence measurement\nSame as described for cell surface density measurement.",
    "Analysis of receptor plasma membrane stability\nAfter subtracting the background signal from all wells labeled for EGFR, the average signal of each quadruplet in the EGF stimulated plate is normalized to the average of each quadruplet in the unstimulated plate. Results are plotted as the percentage of remaining EGFR at the plasma membrane (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1732-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative graph showing the plasma membrane stability of EGFR after 20 min of EGF stimulation (50 ng/mL, 37°C) in ESCRT-depleted HeLa cells (shESCRT) compared to control cells (HeLa NT)\nEGFR levels after stimulation (t=20 min) are normalized to that in the unstimulated plate (t=0 h) and plotted as the percentage remaining at the cell surface. Values represent the average mean +-SEM.\nMeasuring EGFR internalization using cs-ELISA\nCell surface receptor is internalized via endocytosis which is catalyzed by several processes such as clathrin-dependent or -independent mechanisms (Scita and Di Fiore, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). EGFR internalization from the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm can be measured by cs-ELISA upon a short EGF stimulation.\nCell seeding\nSame as described for cell surface stability measurement (i.e., cells should be seeded in two 24-well plates: one to be stimulated with EGF, the second is unstimulated).\nEGF stimulation\nTiming: 5 min\n48 h after cell seeding, starve cells for 2 h in 0.5% FBS-DMEM pre-warmed media at 37°C. After starvation, one plate is stimulated with EGF (50 ng/mL prepared in 0.5% FBS-DMEM media) for 5 min at 37°C, whereas the second plate is left unstimulated. The 5 min EGF stimulation is sufficient to induce the rapid internalization of EGFR (Kazan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nAfter EGF stimulation, the two plates are washed twice with PBS++ and placed on ice for 5–10 min to impede receptor internalization (keep PBS++ in wells).\nReceptor labeling\nSame as described for cell surface density measurement.",
    "Fluorescence measurement\nSame as described for cell surface density measurement.\nAnalysis of cell surface receptor internalization\nSame as described for cell surface stability measurement.\nMeasuring EGFR recycling using cs-ELISA\nUpon ligand activation, several cell surface receptors, including EGFR, undergo ubiquitination and subsequent internalization, and then traverse the early endosomes (Kumari et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Piper et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Receptors in early endosomes can be sorted towards multivesicular bodies and then to lysosomes or recycled back to the plasma membrane via recycling endosomes (Kumari et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nThis experiment requires cell seeding in five different 24-well plates:\nIn plate one (P1): receptor internalization is not induced, hence recycling is not triggered. In plate two (P2): receptor internalization is induced, however, blocking is not performed, and recycling is not triggered. In plate three (P3): receptor internalization is induced, blocking is performed, but recycling is not triggered. In plate four (P4): receptor internalization is induced, blocking is performed and recycling is triggered. (P5): same as P1, however the Ab labeling is different which includes a blocking step. The blocking efficiency of the mouse anti-rat unconjugated F(ab’)2 secondary Ab will be assessed by comparing the signal of P5 to that of P1 (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1732_1.csv\nCell seeding\nTiming: 48 h\nSeed cells in quadruplets in five different 24-well plates (P1, P2, P3, P4 and P5). (Same as described for plasma membrane density measurement).\nReceptor labeling\nTiming: 2 h\nAfter starvation (as described for plasma membrane density measurement), plates are placed on ice for 5–10 min to impede receptor internalization.\nAdd 300 μL/well of rat anti-EGFR primary Ab diluted 1:1000 in ice cold 0.5% BSA/PBS++ and incubate for 1 h on ice.",
    "As a background signal control, an IgG isotype control should be used in every plate (1:1000 dilution, i.e., a final Ab concentration of 1 μg/mL).\nWash cells 3 times with ice cold PBS++ (0.5 mL/well).\nInduce receptor internalization\nTiming: 10 min\nAdd 1 mL of pre-warmed complete media (10% FBS-DMEM media) to P2, P3 and P4 and incubate for 10 min at 37°C to internalize receptors. Keep P1 and P5 on ice to avoid receptor internalization.\nPlace P2, P3 and P4 on ice for 5–10 min to stop receptor internalization.\nWash P2, P3 and P4 once with ice cold PBS++ (0.5 mL/well) on ice.\nBlocking labeled/remaining cell surface EGFR\nTiming: 1 h\nAdd to P3, P4 and P5 300 μL/well of mouse anti-rat unconjugated monovalent F(ab’)2 secondary Ab 1:1000 in ice cold 0.5% BSA/PBS++, and incubate for 1 h on ice, to block remaining cell surface EGFR/Ab complexes. Keep PBS++ in the wells of P1 and P2 and keep the plates on ice.\nWash P3, P4 and P5 five times with ice cold PBS++ (0.5 mL/well) on ice.\nInduce receptor recycling\nTiming: 10 min\nAdd 1 mL of pre-warmed complete media (10% FBS-DMEM media) to P4 and incubate for 10 min at 37°C to trigger receptor recycling.\nPlace P4 on ice for 5–10 min to stop receptor trafficking.\nWash P4 once with ice cold PBS++ (0.5 mL/well) on ice.\nReceptor labeling\nTiming: 1 h\nAdd 300 μL of anti-rat HRP-conjugated F(ab’)2 secondary Ab diluted 1:1500 in ice cold 0.5% BSA/PBS++ to P1, P2, P3 and P4, and incubate for 1 h on ice.\nWash P1, P2, P3 and P4 four times with ice cold PBS++ (0.5 mL/well) on ice.\nFluorescence measurement\nSame as described for plasma membrane density measurement.\nAnalysis of receptor plasma membrane stability",
    "After background signal subtraction from all wells labeled for EGFR, the average signal of each quadruplet in each plate is normalized to the average signal of each quadruplet in P1 plate. Results are plotted as percentage of receptors remaining at the cell surface. To assess the blocking efficiency, the signal from P5 (with the minimum signal intensity) should be compared to P1 (with the maximum signal intensity) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1732-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative graph showing the percentage of EGFR remaining at the plasma membrane in the different plates used to detect EGFR recycling\nUpon ESCRT depletion more EGFR are recycled back to the plasma membrane (P4). Values represent the average mean +-SEM.\nMonitoring EGFR endocytic sorting by fluorescence ratiometric image analysis (FRIA)\nThis method allows tracking the post-endocytic fate of plasma membrane receptors based on pH measurement of internalized cargo-containing compartments in live cells. The detailed description of FRIA technique can be found in: (Barrière et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Barriere and Lukacs, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Kazan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Endocytic organelles (early endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes) have characteristic pHs, which can be used to predict the endocytic compartment of the internalized/labeled EGFR. The recognition of EGFR is carried by a primary antibody which recognizes the extracellular domain of the receptor, followed by recognition with a pH sensitive FITC-conjugated secondary Ab. The determination of FITC fluorescence intensities at 490 nm excitation normalized to that at 450 nm excitation (i.e., ratio 490 nm/450 nm) allows to predict the pH value of the EGFR-containing vesicle in the presence of a multi-point pH calibration curve."
