    "Prepare and set up the electroporator (Figure 1A):Voltage: 100 VPulse length: 50 msPulse number: 6 (1 s interval)Periodicity: 1 kHz.Anesthetize rat with 24-36 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital. (Duration time: 30-60 min)Depilate hindlimbs with depilatory cream (cream should stay for about 3 min) (Figure 2A).Sterilize hindlimbs using absorbent cotton impregnated with 70% (v/v) ethanol.Inject 50 μl of hyaluronidase solution into the quadriceps muscle using a 1 ml syringe with a 26 G two-stage needle (Figure 2B).Leave to stand for 10 min. Stab electrodes into the quadriceps muscle (Figures 1B and 2C).Inject 30 μl of plasmid DNA solution into the same place where hyaluronidase solution pretreatment was done (Figure 2D).Pulse by electroporator (100 V, 50 ms pulse length, 1 kHz, 6 times with each 1 s interval).Repeat the same operation (Steps 3-9) to the other hindlimb (Figure 2A-2D).Note: The required time of operation (Steps 3-10) is about 20 min.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190217/20190217222438_0473.jpgFigure 2. Experimental procedure of DNA immunization using in vivo electroporation. A. Depilate hindlimbs. B. Inject hyaluronidase solution into quadriceps muscle and leave to stand for 10 min. C. Stab the electrodes into the quadriceps muscle. D. Inject plasmid DNA solution into the same place where hyaluronidase solution pretreatment was done. Subsequently, pulse by electroporator. Repeat the same operation (A-D) to the other hindlimb.Repeat the same DNA-immunization protocol 1, 3, 4, 7 and 9 weeks after the primary immunization, respectively (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190217/20190217222455_3489.jpgFigure 3. Overview of DNA immunization using rats. Scheme of DNA immunization using in vivo electroporation.Irradiate (30 Gy) 1 x 109 IL-9R/B300-19 cells in PBS (preferably on ice) using Gamma irradiation device.Transfer 1 x 109 irradiated IL-9R/B300-19 cells intraperitoneally 4-27 weeks after the final immunization.Six or eleven weeks after the primary immunization, check sera of the immunized rats for anti-IL-9R IgG by flow cytometry using IL-9R/B300-19 cells.",
    "Detection with sera diluted by 1:104 or more is desirable (Figure 4A).In order to generate hybridomas that produce monoclonal antibodies, collect splenocytes from the immunized rats 3 days after the cell transfer, and fuse them with mouse myeloma cell line (e.g., SP2/0) by a conventional method (e.g., Köhler and Milstein, 1975).Screen the hybridomas for secretion of IgG Ab that stains IL-9R/B300-19 cells (and does not stain EV/B300-19 cells) using flow cytometry (Figure 4B). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190217/20190217222518_7903.jpgFigure 4. Titration of antisera and hybridoma screening. A. Titration of anti-IL9R antisera using flow cytometry. IL-9R/B300-19 cells were stained with sera, diluted (dil) as indicated, of a rat, immunized 6 weeks previously. B. An example of flow cytometric analysis in hybridoma screening. IL-9R/B300-19 or EV/B300-19 cells were stained with hybridoma supernatant. (A-B) Bound IgGs were revealed with FITC-conjugated anti-rat IgG Ab.Stain the cells expressing IL-9R utilizing anti-mouse IL-9R (e.g., Figure 5) (Takatsuka et al., 2018).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190217/20190217222536_1124.jpgFigure 5.
