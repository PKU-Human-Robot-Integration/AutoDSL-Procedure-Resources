    "The research was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (protocol number: 14-2108).\n1. Blood collection from donors\nCollect whole blood using clean venipuncture into the antecubital vein with a 21 G needle. Discard the first 3 mL of blood because this portion of blood may contain TF from perivascular cells.\nDraw 2.7 or 1.8 mL (depending on the size of the tubes) of blood into a vacutainer containing 3.2% sodium citrate (0.109 mol/L). Do not over- or underfill the tubes. Gently invert tubes immediately after blood collection to disperse the sodium citrate.\nAvoid agitation if the tubes are transported before processing. Prepare plasma within 2 h of blood collection.\n2. Preparation of negative control plasma\nNOTE: Samples should not be placed on ice at any time before the final freeze.\nPrepare negative control plasma using whole blood from healthy volunteers. Immediately after blood collection, prepare platelet-free plasma as follows.\n\t\nTransfer blood samples from the vacutainer tubes to 15 mL tubes.\nCentrifuge blood samples at 2,500 × g for 15 min at room temperature (20-24 °C) without brake.\nTransfer the supernatant (platelet-poor plasma) to a new tube and repeat the spin under the same conditions.\nTransfer the supernatant (platelet-depleted plasma) to a new tube.\nAliquot the sample into ≥100 µL aliquots. Leave approximately 100 µL at the bottom of the tube.\nImmediately freeze the platelet-depleted plasma at −80 °C (Figure 1).\n3. Preparation of positive control plasma\nNOTE: Response to lipopolysaccharide is variable between individuals.\nTransfer blood samples from the vacutainers to 15 mL tubes.\nPrepare positive control plasma using whole blood from healthy volunteers stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Escherichia coli O111:B4 (10 µg/mL) for 5 h at 37 °C with agitation.",
    "After 5 h incubation, follow the steps 2.1.2 to 2.1.6.\n4. Isolation of extracellular vesicles from plasma\nNOTE: EV pellets may not be visible. The defrosting time is dependent on sample volume but we usually defrost 100 µL plasma for 30 min at 37 °C.\nDefrost plasma samples at 37 °C.\nAdd 1 mL of HBSA without calcium [HBSA-Ca(-)] buffer [137 mM NaCl, 5.38 mM KCl, 5.55 mM glucose, 10 mM HEPES, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin] to each 100 µL of plasma sample in a 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge plasma samples at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant down to 20 µL without disturbing the EV pellet.\nReconstitute the EV pellet by adding 1 mL of HBSA-Ca(-) buffer to each tube, pipette up and down at the location of the EV pellet, and vortex each tube before centrifuging for a second time at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant down to 20 µL without disturbing the EV pellet.\nReconstitute the EV pellet in 80 µL of HBSA-Ca(-) and pipette up and down at the location of the EV pellet (Figure 2).\n5. Option: Isolation of small extracellular vesicles using ultracentrifuge\nAfter step 4.3, collect the supernatant and ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant down to 20 µL without disturbing the EV pellet.\nReconstitute the EV pellet by adding 1 mL of HBSA-Ca(-) buffer to each tube and vortex each tube before ultracentrifuging for a second time at 100,000 × g for 70 min at 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant down to 20 µL without disturbing the EV pellet.\nReconstitute the EV pellet in 80 µL of HBSA-Ca(-).\n6. Measurement of extracellular vesicle tissue factor activity",
    "NOTE: EV samples should be pipetted and vortexed well to mix before adding to wells. EDTA-disodium will inhibit the ability of FXa to cleave the chromogenic substrate. Therefore, EDTA-disodium cannot be used as a replacement for EDTA-tetrasodium in step 6.7.\nAdd 40 µL of an EV sample to two wells of a 96-well plate.\nAdd 11 µL of an inhibitory mouse anti-human TF IgG [(36.4 µg/mL, final concentration 7.8 µg/mL)] to one well of an EV sample and 11 µL of control mouse IgG [(36.4 µg/mL, final concentration 7.8 µg/mL)] to the other well.\nIncubate the 96-well plate for 15 min at room temperature.\nDuring the incubation time, prepare 50 µL/well of TF standards (0, 0.32, 0.63, 1.25, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 pg/mL) in duplicate using relipidated recombinant TF.\nPrepare factor mix by mixing 4 mL of HBSA with calcium [HBSA-Ca(+)] [HBSA-Ca(-) + 10 mM CaCl2, final concentration 10 mM], 800 µL of 900 nM FX in HBSA-Ca(+) (final concentration: 146.4 nM), and 120 µL of 200 nM FVIIa in HBSA-CA(+) (final concentration: 4.8 nM).\nAdd 50 µL of the factor mix solution to each well, cover the plate with film, and incubate for 2 h in an incubator at 37 °C.\nAfter 2 h, stop FXa generation by adding 25 µL of HBSA ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) buffer [HBSA-Ca(-) + 25 mM EDTA-tetrasodium, final concentration 5 mM] and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nReconstitute the chromogenic substrate that is cleaved by FXa to 4mM (add 8.7 mL of distilled water to a 25 mg vial).\nAdd 25 µL of the chromogenic substrate solution to each well, cover the plate with film and then with aluminum foil to protect it from light, and incubate for 15 min at 37 °C.",
    "After 15 min of incubation, remove bubbles with a needle or by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 1 min.\nRead the plate at 405 nm using a plate reader with one mix before reading.\nConvert the FXa generation of each well to TF activity using the standard curve generated using relipidated recombinant TF.\nCalculate TF-dependent FXa generation (EVTF activity) using equation (1):\n\tTF-dependent FXa generation (EVTF activity [pg/mL]) = Total FXa generation (control IgG well) - TF-independent FXa generation (anti-TF IgG well) (Figure 3) (1)\nSubscription Required.
