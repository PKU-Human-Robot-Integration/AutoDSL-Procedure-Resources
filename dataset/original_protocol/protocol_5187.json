    "Growing and maintaining Caco-2 cell linesUsing MF-Millipore filters prepare media, Caco-2, human colon adenocarcinoma cells are maintained in cEMEM (complete EMEM, see Recipes) Seeding cells: Thaw a vial of frozen Caco-2 cells from ATCC (or previously frozen cells in the lab) by gentle agitation in a 37 °C water bath. To reduce the possibility of contamination, keep the O-ring and cap of the tube out of the water. Thawing should be rapid (approximately 2 min)Remove the vial from the water bath as soon as the contents are thawed, and decontaminate by dipping in or spraying with 70% ethanol. All of the operations from this point on should be carried out under strict aseptic conditions.Transfer the vial contents to a centrifuge tube containing 9.0 ml cEMEM and spin at 125 x g for 5 to 7 min. Discard supernatant. Resuspend cells in 1 ml cEMEM and transfer the cell suspension to flask containing pre-warmed (37 °C) cEMEM. Place the flask in CO2 forced-air incubator at 37 °C.24 h after seeding, check the cells under microscope for attachment, if attached to flask surface, slowly aspirate media to remove dead cells and add pre-warmed (37 °C) cEMEM.Re-feed cells every 48-72 h or when the color of the media changes. For re-feeding the cells, carefully aspirate the existing media using pipette and add fresh media to the flasks without disturbing the cells. Check cells for contamination and confluency every 48 h. When 80% of the flask surface is covered by cells, they are ready for passaging (Natoli et al., 2012).Cells need to be passaged for a minimum of 3 cycles before using them for the experiment. When the flask is contaminated, the media is cloudy and cells do not adhere to the flask surface.For passaging, remove media and wash monolayer with 1x PBS.",
    "Add 2-4 ml (depending on the size of flask) of trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate at 37 °C for 1-4 min (do not over incubate cells). When cells start sloughing add media (1:10, trypsin to media ratio) to inactivate trypsin and thoroughly pipette several times to get a uniform cell suspension.Count cells using a hemacytometer and seed a 12 well cell culture plate with a density of 105 cells/well. Each cell will require 1 to 2 ml depending and the size and manufacturer. Calculate the cells accordingly.Preparation of bacterial cultureUsing sterile microbiology technique streak listeria strains (WT and Mutant) from frozen cultures on BHI agar and place them in a 37 °C incubator for 48 h.From a freshly grown bacterial culture plate pick single isolated colony with a pipette tip and drop it in a 15 ml culture tube containing 10 ml BHI broth. Incubate the tubes in a 37 °C shaker for overnight. (see Note 5)Overnight cultures (15 ml) of F2365 (wild type) and F2365∆2117 (mutant) L. monocytogenes strains in BHI broth are adjusted to an OD600 = 1.0 using fresh BHI broth on the day of infection if necessary.For each strain, pellet 100 µl of the above bacterial suspension in a bench top micro centrifuge for 2 min at 3,000 x g.Wash pellet and resuspend it in 1 ml of fresh warm (37 °C) cEMEM.Use 30 µl from step B3 for infections with Caco-2 cells.Adhesion assayPlates with Caco-2 cells from step A5 are infected following the template shown in Figure 1 with bacterial culture from step B3 (Multiplicity of infection [MOI]: 1 Caco-2 cell:10 bacterial cells).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170427/20170427203905_6603.jpgFigure 1. Plate template for infection of Caco-2 cells. Caco-2 cells are seeded in 12 well cell culture plates and infected with appropriate bacterial strain as labeled in the template.",
    "Infections were performed in three replicates per plate for each strain. Three wells were uninfected or untreated and three wells were infected with cEMEM sans bacteria and acted as negative controls (NC1 and NC2).Infect one well at a time and change pipette tip after every infection. (see Note 4)Centrifuge the plates briefly for 45 sec and incubate them at 37 °C for 30 min. Centrifugation aids mixing and binding of bacteria to mammalian cells.After incubation wash cells five times with 1x PBS and lyse using 500 µl of cold 0.1% Triton X-100.The resulting suspensions are diluted (1/100, 1/1,000 and 1/10,000) using 1xPBS.100 µl of 1/1,000 and 1/10,000 diluted suspensions are spread on BHI agar, and grown at 37 °C for 48 h. (see Note 5)48 h post incubation count bacterial colonies, record and calculate colony forming units.Invasion assayPlates with Caco-2 cells from step A5 are infected with bacterial culture from step B3 (MOI:1 Caco-2 cell:10 bacterial cells) as shown in Figure 1.Infect one well at a time and change pipette tip after every infection. (see Note 4) Centrifuge the plates briefly for 45 sec and incubate them at 37 °C for 2 h.After incubation wash twice with 1x PBS, and add fresh media containing gentamycin (100 µg/ml) to kill extracellular bacteria.At 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24 h post-infection, cells are washed twice with 1x PBS and lysed using 500 µl of cold 0.1% Triton X-100. Once lysed cells float in the solution, using a pipette carefully mix the solution (without splashing) to remove adherent cells if any. Pipetting also helps in breaking mammalian cells. Transfer lysate from each well to separate appropriately labelled microcentrifuge tubes and proceed to sonication.",
    "Sonic dismembrator settings: setting 3 (operation frequency: 20 kHz and power rating: 120 watts), 3 pulses, 5 sec each helps in further lysis of Caco-2 cells but does not harm L. monocytogenes.100 µl of 1/1,000 and 1/10,000 diluted suspensions are spread on BHI agar, and grown at 37 °C for 48 h. (see Note 5)48 h post incubation count bacterial colonies, record and calculate colony forming units."
