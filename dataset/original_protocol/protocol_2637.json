Mix together plasmid and bacteria by finger flicking. Incubate the mixture on ice for 30 min.\nNote: Too much starting plasmid will result in the crowding of bacterial colonies on agar plates.\nNote: Each aliquot of XJb (DE3) competent cells is 100 μL in volume from the manufacturer.\nHeat shock competent cells at 42°C for 1 min and then cool on ice for 2 min.\nTransfer 950 μL fresh LB broth (Lennox) to competent cells and grow bacteria for 1 h in a bacterial shaker at 37°C and 250 rpm.\nEvenly distribute 100 μL bacterial culture on a LB (Lennox) agar, supplemented with 100 μg/mL Carbenicillin. Grow bacterial colonies overnight in an incubator at 37°C.\nPause point: The agar plate containing bacterial colonies can be stored at 4°C for no more than 1 month. Each plate needs to be sealed with parafilm to prevent culture contamination.\nInoculating and expending bacterial culture\nTiming: 2 days (for step 5)\nThis step is to expend culture for 8×His-TEV-SaCas9-containing competent cells.\nSelect 2 bacterial colonies from LB (Lennox) agar and grow each colony in 3 mL LB (Lennox) broth, supplemented with 100 μg/mL carbenicillin, in a bacterial shaker overnight at 37°C and 250 rpm. Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nExpand the overnight culture in a 50 mL LB broth (Lennox) culture, supplemented with 100 μg/mL carbenicillin, in a bacterial shaker overnight at 37°C and 250 rpm.\nPause point: Individual bacterial culture can be stored at 4°C for no more than 3 days.\n8×His-TEV-SaCas9 protein induction",

Decant the supernatant and resuspend cells in buffer A, supplemented with 1 mM PMSF. Freeze cells at −80°C until protein purification.\nNote: The wet weight of bacterial pellet is typically 1.5–1.7 g per liter of induced bacterial culture.\nNote: The ratio of buffer A and bacteria pellet wet weight is set at 1:10 (v:w). i.e., 10 mL buffer for 1 g bacteria pellet.\nPause point: Suspended bacteria solution can be stored in a −80°C freezer for no more than 6 months.\nImmobilized metal affinity chromatography-assisted enrichment of 8×His-TEV-SaCas9 proteins\nTiming: 90 min (for step 10)\nThis step is for an initial capture of 8×His-TEV-SaCas9 proteins with a Ni2+-NTA column.\nLyse cells by freeze and thaw between liquid nitrogen and 37°C water bath 2 times.\nNote: A successful lysis procedure can be observed when liquid viscosity is transformed from runny to an egg white consistency.
