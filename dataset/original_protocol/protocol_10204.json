  "procedures": [
    "The procedures described in this protocol were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Utah State University (IACUC protocol: 2484). Hamsters used in this protocol are adult (6 - 10 weeks of age) LVG strain golden Syrian hamsters. All hamsters are housed in the vivarium at the Bioinnovation center, Utah State University. Room temperature is set at 23 °C, humidity is set at 40 - 50%, and light cycle is set 14L:10D (light:dark). Whenever possible, embryo manipulation and surugical procedures should be performed with sterile techniques.\n1. sgRNA and Cas9/sgRNA Ribonucleoproteins (RNP) Preparation\nSynthesize sgRNAs following the in vitro transcription procedures described in the manual of synthesis kit (Materials Table, Supplement 1).\nTo assemble ribonucleoproteins, mix 2 µg of Cas9 with 1 µg of sgRNA and incubate the mix at room temperature for 10 - 15 min. For PN injection, make a working solution at the concentration of 100 ng/µL Cas9 and 50 ng/µL sgRNA with 10 mM TE buffer (RNase free, Materials Table).\n2. Vasectomy Preparation\nNOTE: Vasectomy is performed on male hamsters at 6 - 8 weeks of age. The surgery should be performed 10-14 days ahead of the first mating. Sterility is confirmed by failed pregnancies from mating with fertile females. Vasectomized males can normally be used for a year before they become less sexually active.\nAnesthetize males by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ketamine/xylazine with a dose of 40 mg/kg (ketamine) and 10 mg/kg (xylazine). Confirm anesthesia by lack of a pedal reflex (toe pinch).\nLay the sedated hamster in dorsal recumbency on a dry tissue paper. Rinse the abdomen with three rounds of antiseptic treatments by alternating surgical scrub solutions between 70% alcohol and povidone-iodine.",
    "Make a vertical incision with surgical scissors starting 1.5 cm cranial to the prepuce extending 1 cm to each side from mid line (Figure 1a). Incise the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and linea alba to access the peritoneal space (Figure 1b).\nApply gentle pressure to the caudal aspect of the scrotum to force the testes and fat tissue out. Grasp the vas deferens gently with forceps and carefully separate the blood vessel from the vas with a second set of forceps (Figure 1c).\nHold the vas deferens with forceps to form a loop. Heat the tip of another forceps in flame until it is red, and then use it to remove the loop of the vas deferens. Insert fat tissue and testes back to abdomen. Remove the vas deferens on the opposing side with the same procedures.\nSuture the musculature first followed by suturing the skin. Place the animal on a warm pad in a cage for 30 min until the animal recovers. Observe the animal until it resumes normal activity.\n3. Donor/Recipient Hamster Preparation Schedule\nMonitor and record estrous cycles.\n\tNOTE: Female hamsters have a stable 4-days estrous cycle that is maintained immediately after parturition. Females on the first day of estrous can be identified by the opaque, yellowish and sticky vaginal discharge (Figure 2a). Females on Day 4 of estrous can be identified by the transparent, sticky mucus (Figure 2b).\nFor superovulation of donor hamster, superovulate the sexually mature females (>6 weeks) on the first day of the estrous cycle by IP injection of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (PMSG; dissolved in PBS as 50 IU/mL) (Table 1) between 9 - 12 AM.\n\tNOTE: PMSG is for inducing superovulation but not for estrous cycle synchronization.",
    "80 - 84 h after injection of PMSG (Day 4, 6 - 8 PM), place the females in cages with males for mating. As hamster matings do not result in copulation plugs, ensure successful matings by watching the matings.\nPrepare pseudopregnant females by mating sexually mature females on Day 4 of estrous with vasectomized males. The time schedule for preparing donor and recipient females are shown in Table 2.\n\tNOTE: True pregnant females can also be used as recipients, i.e., females with a coat color distinguishable from the golden color matted with the same color fertile males. Pups derived from embryo transfer can be identified based on coat colors. A potential advantage in using true pregnant females is that endogenously produced embryos would ensure successful pregnancies and help PN injected embryos to implant; a potential drawback in using true pregnant females as recipients is that PN injected embryos need to compete with endogenously produced embryos for implantation.\n4. Zygote Isolation\nPrepare culture medium (HECM-9; recipe is described in Supplement 2), as described previously in McKiernan and Bavister12.\nOne day prior to PN injection, prepare zygote handling dishes (25 µL/drop) and a PN injection drop (100 µL) in the lid of a 35 mm dish with HECM-9. Then cover the medium drops with mineral oil. Balance medium in an incubator overnight under the following conditions: 37.5 °C, 10% CO2, 5% O2, 85% N2 and 100% humidity.\nOn the day scheduled for PN injection, prepare embryo flushing dishes (1 dish/donor hamster) with HECM-9 and store all dishes in the incubator until use.\nEuthanize superovulated hamsters with CO2.\nOviduct Isolation\n\t\nPlace a euthanized female hamster in dorsal recumbency on a surgical drape or tissue paper and prepare the abdomen with a 70% ethanol spray.",
    "Firmly hold skin and abdominal muscle layer at the midline and make an incision. Incise the peritoneum to expose the abdominal organs.\nGrasp one of the uterine horns with a fine forceps and retract the tissue from the abdomen. Separate the uterus from the mesometrium and fat tissue. Make a cut between the oviduct and ovary and a second cut adjacent to the junction of the oviduct and uterus (include a small part of uterus). Place the two oviducts in the same flush dish.\nFlush and collect zygotes\n\t\nUnder the dissection microscope, grasp the side of uterine horn with a #5 Dumont forceps and insert a homemade needle (Figure 3) into the lumen of the oviduct from the infundibular end and flush the oviduct with 300 - 400 µL of HECM-9 medium.\nCollect the zygotes immediately and wash them twice with HECM-9 medium in the handling dish. At this stage of development, all of the zygotes should be denuded from cumulus cells.\nPlace the zygotes in an incubator (37.5 °C, 10% CO2, 5% O2, 85% N2 and 100% humidity) immediately after collection to minimize exposure to light .\n5. PN Injection\nThaw the Cas9/sgRNA RNP on ice and maintain the complex on ice during the entire PN injection process.\nLoad the injection needles with Cas9/sgRNA RNP solution immediately before the injection experiments. Place the rear end of the injection needles into the tube containing the Cas9/sgRNA RNP solution and allow the Cas9/sgRNA RNP solution to fill the needle by capillary action.",
    "Prepare the injection dish and needles. Fill the holder pipette with mineral oil to within ~3 mm of the bend of the holder needle. Place the holder in the microinjector with the tip of the needle horizontal to the bottom of the dish and fill the tip of the needle with medium by suction. Set the injection needle at a 10 - 15° angle opposite to holder.\nPN injection\n\t\nIdentify a zygote and apply a fine suction with the holder needle. Ideally, the male and female pronuclei are within the same focal range and aligned parallel to holder.\nPenetrate the zona and male pronuclei (3 o'clock position) with the injection needle.\nWithdraw the injection needle quickly once the pronucleus swells to prevent the nucleus from adhering to the needle and to avoid damaging the pronucleus.\n6. Zygotes Transfer to Pseudopregnant Hamsters\nAnesthetize a pseudopregnant hamster (the same way as described in the vasectomy section above) and lay it on a surgical drape or dry tissue paper in ventral recumbency.\nApply eye lubricants to the eyes of the animal to prevent eye dryness and cover the head with a cloth or paper to protect the eyes from light. Prepare the lateral aspect of the body by shaving a about 4 cm x 4 cm skin area on each sides of the body followed by applying 3 times of povidone-iodine scrubs and 3 times  70% ethanol scrubs. Make a 2 cm vertical incision 2 cm caudal to the last rib (as shown in Figures 4a, 4b) on each side of the back of the animal.",
    "Grasp the fat pad with forceps and pull gently until the oviduct and uterus are visible. Clamp the fat pad with a hemostats and reflect the fat pad dorsally over the spine (Figure 4c). Position the reproductive tract such that the uterine tube can be penetrated with a 30 gauge needle for embryo transfer (Figure 4d).\nWash the injected zygotes with HECM-9 in a new dish. Use a new glass pipette (diameter: ~150 - 200 µm) to load 10 - 15 zygotes. Arrange the zygotes as a chain of pearls followed by several air bubbles. Insert the pipette into the open penetrated tube from step 6.3 and gently blow into the pipette to transfer the zygotes to the oviduct. Continue blowing until the first air bubble is released into the oviduct tract (Figure 4e).\nRelease the fat pad and return the tissue to the abdomen. Transfer approximately the same number (10 - 15) of injected embryos to another oviduct tract by the same processes.\nSuture the musculature and the skin in 2 layers. Administer Buprenorphine-HCL ( 0.5 mg/kg) subcutaneously as post-op analgesia. Return the hamster to a cage and place the cage on a warm pad for recovery. Return the cage to the animal room when the animal is fully recovered from anesthesia. Post-op analgesics are given again six hours later.\nSubscription Required.
