    "Notes: Although TMT is not a deleterious substance, it can cause irritations at high concentrations so it should be treated in a fume hood.TMT is colorless but has a distinct, strong smell. Thus, it is not easy to perform the experiments with the experimenter blinded to the exposure condition. However, if the fume hood has a minimal opening and there is no leakage of TMT, performing this experiment in a blinded manner may be possible.Sex-and age-matched littermate controls should be used (sex, age, genetic background, and parental nurturance could affect animal behavior).The experimenter should opt for either single- or group-housing, since the number of cage mates might affect the results. I kept 2-4 mice per cage (136 x 208 x 115 mm).Avoid cage changing 24 h before the all the procedures of the experiment. Genotype/treatment should be blinded to avoid experimenter bias.Handle all animals twice for 5 min each in a fume hood the day before the TMT exposure to habituate them to the experimenter and the fume hood (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. An example of mice handling in the fume hood Move animal housing cages in the experimental room from the breeding area at least 30 min before start of the experiment.Note: If possible, experimental animal cages should be placed in a next room to experimental room to minimize an effect of leaking TMT during the experiment.Stick a piece of Kimwipe (1.5 x 2 cm) to the top edge of the wall of a disposable circular test chamber (Figure 1A).Place the test chamber in the fume hood and locate the CCD camera in a suitable position so that the test chamber is kept within its visual field (Figure 1B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170829/20170829195416_5876.jpgFigure 1.

    "The chamber is placed at the center of the walled area and illuminated at 500 lux in my equipment.Place each mouse gently into the test chamber, put on a transparent lid with vents, and close the door with a blinder to hide the experimenter from the mouse. Start video capture. This ‘no-odor’ interval lasts for 5 min, in order to record a baseline level of freezing. Open the door and apply the neat 5 μl TMT to the Kimwipe with a Pipetman pipette. Close the door and continue observing for 12 min to monitor TMT-induced freezing.Note: Pay attention to avoid potential leakage of TMT from the fume hood to the experimental room. If TMT is spilled out, wipe out as soon as possible with 80% ethanol or 5% ammonium hydroxide.Remove the mouse from the test chamber and place it into the temporary holding chamber next to the experiment room, to prevent untested mice from being disturbed by TMT on the surface of the analyzed mouse.Replace the test chamber with a new one and seal off the used test chamber tightly in a plastic bag and place it at a separate room (Each test chamber is used only once). Renew gloves and repeat from step 5.When all experimental procedures are completed, wipe fume hood with 80% ethanol or 5% ammonium hydroxide and discard all experimental apparatus such as cardboard walls and test chambers."
