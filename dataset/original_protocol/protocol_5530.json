    "Solution preparationNotes: Buffers For the interactions between SPT6L(Phe1218-Asp1412) and the CTD peptides of the A. thaliana RNA polymerase II, the assay buffer is NaP buffer (see Recipes).For the interactions between the HP1 proteins and the histone peptides, the assay buffer is MST-T buffer (see Recipes).Preparation of the working solutions of the targetsPeptides CTD-noP, CDT-Ser2P, and CDT-Ser5P: These peptides serve as targets for binding of SPT6L(Phe1218-Asp1412).Follow the manufacturers’ instructions and dissolve the peptides.Prepare the target working solution by diluting the peptide stocks to 80 nM with MST-T buffer.HP1 proteins from P. falciparum and D. melanogaster. These proteins serve as the targets for binding of the different histone peptides. Labeling of the targets is not necessary in this context, because their intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence can be used with the Monolith NT.LabelFree device.Prepare the target working solution by diluting the protein stocks to 3.5 µM in MST-T buffer.Preparation of the working solution of the ligandSPT6L(Phe1218-Asp1412) protein: This protein serves as the ligand for binding of the CTD-peptides.Dilute the ligand stock with MST-T buffer to 4.3 mM. Ideally, the concentration of the working solution of the ligand should be around 50-times higher than the projected KD value.Note: Centrifugation of the ligand stock for 5 min at 14,000 x g at 4 °C may help remove aggregates. Low volume, low binding reaction tubes (e.g., Thermo Fisher Scientific) are recommended to avoid adsorption of molecules to the tube walls.When preparing the ligand working solution it has to be considered that–depending on the dilution factor–a certain amount of ligand stock buffer can still be present in the working solution. If this exceeds 1%, we recommend adjusting the final MST buffer accordingly.Histone peptides: These peptides serve as the ligands for the measurements with the two HP1 protein targets.Follow the manufacturers’ instructions and dissolve the peptides.",
    "Prepare the ligand working stock by diluting the peptide stocks to 20 mM in NaP buffer.Preparation of the ligand dilution seriesThe ligand is diluted in 16 serial steps in 200 µl PCR tubes. Dilute the ligand by 50% (1:1 dilution) in each of the sixteen steps.Note: The concentration finder tool implemented in the control software simulates binding data and helps with finding the right concentration range for the dilution series.Add 10 µl of assay buffer into PCR tubes 2 to 16.Fill 20 µl of the ligand working solution in PCR tube 1.Transfer 10 µl from PCR tube 1 into PCR tube 2 and mix properly by pipetting up and down several times.Note: Avoid vortexing or heavy shaking in order to prevent protein denaturation.Transfer 10 µl from PCR tube 2 into PCR tube 3 and mix. Repeat this process for the remaining dilution steps.Discard the excess 10 µl from the last tube. All 16 PCR tubes should now contain a volume of 10 µl.Note: It is important to avoid any buffer dilution effects. All 16 PCR tubes should contain the exact same buffer composition. If the ligand stock solution is in a different buffer than the MST assay buffer, the best practice is to prepare an aliquot of the MST assay buffer that features the exact same composition as the buffer of the ligand working solution. This buffer is then used for pipetting the serial dilution series. For example, if the ligand stock solution is in buffer A + 2 mM DTT and is diluted 10-fold in buffer A to yield the ligand working solution, the DTT concentration in the working solution is 0.2 mM. Thus use buffer A + 0.2 mM DTT for preparing the serial dilution series.",
    "Preparation of the final MST mixAlthough a volume of 4 µl is sufficient to fill the MST capillaries, it is advised to prepare at least 20 µl of the final MST mix in order to minimize pipetting errors.Add 10 µl of the target working solution to each 10 µl ligand dilution step and mix properly by pipetting up and down several times.Note: Avoid vortexing or heavy shaking in order to prevent protein denaturation.Incubate at room temperature for five minutes to achieve binding equilibrium. Longer incubation times or different incubation temperatures may be required depending on the specific targets and ligands. The specific incubation time and temperature have to be chosen with a priori knowledge about the interaction to be analyzed. As a general suggestion, we recommend to incubate for between 5 and 20 min at room temperature.Fill 16 capillaries with the 16 MST mixes by dipping the capillaries into the sample. Note: Do not touch the capillaries in the middle section where the optical measurement will take place.Place the capillaries onto the capillary tray and start the MST device.MST measurementStarting the MST deviceStart the MST control software and adjust the desired temperature by enabling temperature control. Usually measurements are performed at 25 °C. Wait for the temperature to reach the predefined value.Note: MST instruments can be temperature-controlled from 22 to 45 °C.Place the capillary tray in the MST device.Set the LED channel (fluorescence excitation) to ‘blue’ for FITC fluorophore labels and set the LED power to gain a fluorescence signal of 300 to 1,000 units at an MST device with a standard sensor and 6,000 to 18,000 on a device with a high-sensitivity sensor.Note: Other fluorescent labels may require the ‘red’ LED setting. Check the excitation wavelengths of the used fluorophore.",
    "Capillary scanPerform a capillary scan in order to check different quality aspects of the sample.Check the capillary scan to see if the maximum fluorescence signal obtained falls in the ranges described above.Check the capillary scan for sticking effects of labeled target to the glass walls of the capillaries. This leads to U-shaped or flattened peaks.Check the capillary scan for pipetting errors. These lead to inconsistent fluorescence values across the 16 MST mixes.Check the capillary scan for ligand-dependent fluorescence enhancement or quenching effects. These lead to increasing or decreasing fluorescence values with increasing ligand concentration in the 16 MST mixes.MST measurementBefore starting an MST measurement, make sure to exclude any sticking effects, pipetting errors, enhancing/quenching effects, and ensure a sufficient fluorescence signal.Assign each of the 16 MST mixes with the respective final ligand concentration in the control software. In newer control software versions, only the highest ligand concentration (usually in MST mix 1) is set and the dilution type (e.g., 1:1 or 1:2) is chosen.Note: The ligand concentration that has to be entered at this point is half the concentration of the ligand dilution series described above, because the dilution samples were mixed 1:1 with target solution.Enter the fixed concentration of the fluorescently labeled target.Note: This concentration is also half the concentration of the target working solution due to the preparation of the MST mixes described above.For most applications, the default settings (initial fluorescence for 5 sec, recording of thermophoresis for 30 sec, and after-thermophoresis fluorescence for a further 5 sec) are sufficient.Adjust the MST-power to 20%.Notes:  In order to receive the best signal-to-noise ratio and to avoid unspecific effects, a laser power of 20-40% is recommended. In some cases, a higher laser power may be required to get good separation of unbound and bound molecules.",
    "In newer control software versions only the MST power settings ‘low’, ‘medium’, and ‘high’ are available. ‘Medium’ is recommended for most applications.Enter a destination folder path where the experiment file will be saved. The experiment will be saved as a .ntp file.Start the MST measurement. The measurement will take between 10-15 min, depending on the times set.Repeat the MST measurement at least twice for a more reliable determination of the equilibrium binding affinity.Note: In order to test the technical reproducibility of the measurement, the same capillaries can be used for several MST measurements."
