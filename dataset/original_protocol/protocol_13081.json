    "NOTE: An overview of the entire experimental design is depicted in Figure 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63210/63210fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Overview of the in vitro screening assay of Trypanosoma cruzi Dm28c/pLacZ line using CPRG as a substrate for the colorimetric reaction. The assay consists of seeding the parasites (1), incubating them with BZN (2 and 3), and then adding the colorimetric substrate (4). When parasites are lysed, β-galactosidase is released and cleaves CPRG to chlorophenol red; this change in color can be measured spectrophotometrically (5). Data can be analyzed in statistical analysis software to obtain the half inhibitory concentration (IC50) of BZN. Abbreviations: CPRG = chlorophenol red β-D-galactopyranoside; BZN = benznidazole.

Preparation of stock solutions\nPreparation of media and solutions\n\t\nHemin solution (Supplemental Table S1)\n\t\t\nAdd all the components to a 50 mL centrifuge tube in the order given in the recipe and homogenize by inversion several times.\nSterilize by filtration through a 0.22 µm filter.\nPrepare 1 mL aliquots in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and keep them at -80 °C until use.\nLiver Infusion Tryptose (LIT) Medium (Supplemental Table S1)\n\t\t\nWeigh all the components and stir to homogenize at room temperature in a 1 L beaker containing at least 700 mL of distilled water.\nAdjust the pH to 7.2 and top up the volume to 900 mL in a 1 L graduated cylinder with distilled water; sterilize by filtration or autoclaving (121 °C for 20 min).\nSupplement the medium by adding 100 mL of fetal calf serum (FCS), (10% FCS, sterile and heat-inactivated at 56 °C for 45 min), 20 mL of 40% sterile glucose solution (sterilized by autoclaving, 121 °C for 20 min), and 5 mL of hemin solution (final concentration 5 µM) to 900 mL of LIT medium.",
    "Prepare Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) from the powder following the manufacturer's instructions.\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Supplemental Table S1)\n\t\t\nDissolve all solid components by stirring the solution at room temperature in a 1 L beaker.\nAdjust the pH to 7.2, level up to 1 L in a 1 L graduated cylinder with distilled water, and sterilize by filtration or autoclaving (121 °C, 20 min).\nBenznidazole (BZN) stock solutions and dilutions\n\tNOTE: The range of BZN concentration used in this work was 2.5 to 80 µM.\n\t\nPrepare a stock solution of 1 M BZN by dissolving 13 mg of the drug in 50 µL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Under aseptic conditions, prepare serial dilutions from this 1 M BZN stock solution at twice the final desired concentration (2x solutions) in a final volume that is adequate for the number of wells to be assayed.\n\t\tNOTE: Calculate for 100 µL per well with an excess of 10-20%. The BZN stock solution and all BZN dilutions must be prepared immediately before use in the assay due to the low solubility of the drug in the medium.\nPrepare 2x BZN dilutions of 160, 80, 40, 20, 10, and 5 µM.\n\t\t\nDilute 1 M BZN stock solution at a 100-fold dilution (10 µL of 1 M BZN + 990 µL of medium) to obtain a 10 mM solution in the appropriate medium used for each life cycle stage of T. cruzi. Mix continuously to homogenize the suspension.\nDilute 10 mM BZN solution to prepare 320 µM BZN in the appropriate medium: 32 µL of 10 mM BZN + 968 µL of medium. Mix continuously to homogenize the suspension.",
    "Dilute 320 µM BZN 2-fold to obtain a concentration of 160 µM (500 µL of 320 µM BZN + 500 µL of medium). Mix continuously to homogenize the suspension. Repeat this 2-fold dilution with each resulting solution to obtain 80, 40, 20, 10, and 5 µM solutions.\nDilute DMSO 1,000-fold in the appropriate medium for use as untreated control (100% survival control).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Epimastigotes tolerate up to a 100-fold dilution of DMSO, whereas Vero cells tolerate only up to a 1,000-fold dilution of DMSO. If necessary, a death control with 50% DMSO can be included as the 0% survival condition.\nSubstrate solution\n\t\nDissolve CPRG at 1 mM concentration in distilled water. For a 96-well plate, add 2.4 mg of CPRG to 4 mL of water.\n\t\tNOTE: CPRG solution must be prepared immediately before the assay.\nLysis solution\n\t\nPrepare a 2.5% v/v solution of nonionic, non-denaturing detergent 2-[4-(2,4,4-trimethylpentan-2-yl)phenoxy]ethanol (see the Table of Materials) in 1x PBS. Prepare 1 mL of the solution per 96-well plate immediately before the assay.\n2. Parasite culture preparation\nEpimastigote preparation\n\tNOTE: T. cruzi Dm28c/pLacZ line13 is used throughout this report.\n\t\nGrow the β-galactosidase-expressing T. cruzi epimastigotes axenically at 28 °C in cell culture flasks with a growth area of 25 cm2 (T-25 flasks). Maintain the cultures in log phase by subculturing every 48-72 h (in 5 mL) in LIT medium supplemented with 10% FCS (Supplemental Table S1) and geneticin sulfate (G418) at a final concentration of 200 µg/mL. Quantify parasite growth by cell counting in a Neubauer chamber before subculturing. Securely close the cap and keep the culture flask (not vented) at 28 °C in a vertical position.\n\t\tNOTE: G418 ensures pLacZ plasmid selection and maintenance. Log phase cultures have an epimastigote concentration of 1-5 × 107 parasites/mL for the Dm28c/pLacZ line.",
    "Prepare a suspension of 2 × 105 epimastigotes/mL from a log phase culture in LIT supplemented with G418 antibiotic. Dispense 100 µL of the epimastigote suspension per well (20,000 epimastigotes in 100 µL of LIT) of a 96-well microplate and make up the final volume to 200 µL per well with the medium.\nAmastigote preparation\n\t\nUse spontaneous metacyclic trypomastigotes obtained from an aged epimastigote culture (for 7 days in this protocol) to perform an initial infection in a T-25 flask with 2 × 105 Vero cells seeded previously in DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS.\n\t\t\nCount the number of metacyclic trypomastigotes in a Neubauer chamber, infect the Vero cell monolayer with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 in 5 mL of DMEM with 2% FCS, and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 16 h. Wash the remaining trypomastigotes by removing the medium from the flask with a 5 mL sterile pipette, then add 5 mL of 1x PBS and aspirate. Finally, add 5 mL of DMEM with 2% FCS and incubate under the same conditions.\nUse the trypomastigotes emerging from the infected Vero cell monolayer to maintain the infection in T-25 flasks with 2 × 105 Vero cells in DMEM with 2% FCS, generating a new infected bottle every week.\n\t\t\tNOTE: After 5-7 days, trypomastigotes start to emerge and are visible in the supernatant. Do not add G418 to the trypomastigotes used to infect the cells or the infected cells, as the Vero cell line is not resistant to G418.",
    "Prepare a suspension of 1 × 105 Vero cells/mL in DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS and seed 100 µL of the suspension per well in 96-well tissue culture plates (10,000 cells per well). Incubate overnight (12-16 h) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to ensure cell adherence to the bottom of the wells.\nAfter the overnight incubation, rinse the Vero cell monolayer three times with 100 µL of sterile 1x PBS. Add T. cruzi Dm28c/pLacZ trypomastigotes (obtained from a previous infection in a T-25 flask, step 2.2.1) at an MOI of 10 in 100 µL of DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS per well (100,000 trypomastigotes per well).\nIncubate the plates for 6 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After this incubation period, wash the plates twice with 1x PBS, and add 100 µL of DMEM without phenol red supplemented with 2% FCS.\n\t\tNOTE: After 48 h (2 days post infection), intracytoplasmic amastigotes are visible with an optic microscope. Phenol red, a pH indicator in DMEM and other cell culture media, could interfere with the absorbance measurement of CPRG. If DMEM without phenol red is not available, see alternatives mentioned below in section 3.2.1.\nTrypomastigote preparation\n\t\nPrepare a suspension of 1 × 106 Vero cells/mL in DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS and seed 800,000 cells in 5 mL of the medium in T-25 flasks. Incubate overnight (12-16 h) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to ensure cell adherence.\n\t\tNOTE: For a T-75 flask, seed 2 × 106 cells in a final volume of 15 mL.\nAfter incubation, rinse two times with 3 mL of sterile 1x PBS. Add T. cruzi Dm28c/pLacZ trypomastigotes at an MOI of 10 in 5 mL of DMEM with 2% FCS (8 × 106 trypomastigotes for a T-25 flask).",
    "NOTE: For a T-75 flask, add 20 × 106 trypomastigotes in a final volume of 15 mL of DMEM with 2% FCS.\nIncubate overnight (12-16 h) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Wash the flask twice with 3 mL of 1x PBS, and add 5 mL of fresh DMEM supplemented with 2% FCS. Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for four days.\nCheck the supernatant for trypomastigotes under an optic microscope. Quantify the trypomastigotes by counting them in a Neubauer chamber. Collect the supernatant in a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 7,000 × g for 10 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet to obtain a concentration of 1 × 106 trypomastigotes/mL in DMEM without phenol red supplemented with 2% FCS. Seed 100 µL of the trypomastigote suspension (100,000 trypomastigotes per well) in a 96-well plate.\n\t\t​NOTE: If DMEM without phenol red is not available, see alternatives below in section 3.2.1.\n3. β-galactosidase assay\nNOTE: Quantitation of β-galactosidase activity is used as an indirect way of determining the number of parasites. It is expected that growth will be inhibited in the presence of a trypanocidal compound, leading to a lower number of parasites compared to the untreated control, which will be reflected in a lower β-galactosidase activity and therefore lower absorbance.\nIncubate the parasites with BZN.\n\t\nAdd 100 µL of corresponding 2x BZN solution per well to reach a final concentration of BZN of 80, 40, 20, 10, 5, and 2.5 µM to 100 µL of epimastigote suspension (from step 2.1), Vero cells with amastigotes (2 days post infection) (step 2.2), or trypomastigotes (step 2.3) in a 96-well plate.",
    "Incubate the epimastigotes at 28 °C for 72 h, and the trypomastigotes or infected Vero cells with amastigotes for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: Each drug concentration should be evaluated at least in triplicate and include control cultures of epimastigotes, trypomastigotes, and infected Vero cells with DMSO (see step 1.2.2.4).\nColorimetric reaction\n\t\nAfter the treatment incubation period, if infected Vero cells or trypomastigotes are in DMEM with phenol red, replace the medium with 100 µL of 1x PBS to avoid interference. Perform triplicate blank wells containing only 100 µL of corresponding medium (or 1x PBS as appropriate).\n\t\tNOTE: It is not necessary to remove the culture medium for epimastigotes in case of LIT medium or DMEM without phenol red. DMEM with phenol red can still be used; prepare a blank well with DMEM alone to measure the base absorbance and then subtract this value during data analysis (step 3.3.). Schneider's insect medium, which is colorless, is an alternative for epimastigotes.\nAdd 40 µL of CPRG substrate solution and 10 µL of the detergent solution to each well, obtaining a final concentration of 200 µM CPRG and 0.1% detergent in a final volume of 250 µL in each well.\n\t\tNOTE: The CPRG solution and detergent can be added together in a final volume of 50 µL per well.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 2 h and measure the absorbance at 595 nm in a microplate spectrophotometer.",
    "NOTE: The expected color change is yellow to reddish-brown upon β-galactosidase enzymatic cleavage (Figure 2A). Incubation time can be extended up to 4 h, and the absorbance spectra of chlorophenol red can be read between 570 and 595 nm with similar curve fittings (Supplemental Figure S1A,B). Incubation for up to 24 h in the presence of CPRG substrate has shown similar curve fittings (Supplemental Figure S1C).\n\t\t\nIn a microplate spectrophotometer with a monochromator selector, create a new protocol in the equipment software (Supplemental Figure S2).\nClick Absorbance as detection method | Endpoint as read type | Ok (Supplemental Figure S2A). Add a Read Step, type the selected wavelength, and click Ok (Supplemental Figure S2B).\nIn the Plate Layout section, mark the wells to be read and click Ok (Supplemental Figure S2C). To read the plate, insert it in the tray and click on Read Plate. Wait for the values to appear on the screen (Supplemental Figure S2D) and export them to a spreadsheet to analyze the results.\nData analysis and media inhibitor concentration (IC50) calculation\n\t\nSubtract the blank measured value, corresponding to only LIT medium, 1x PBS, or DMEM with or without phenol red plus the CPRG-detergent solution. When testing the trypanocidal activity of colored compounds, measure the absorbance of additional blank controls with LIT or DMEM with each concentration of drug used and then subtract those values from the absorbance values obtained with the parasites at each concentration.\n\t\tNOTE: Supplemental Table S2 shows typical values obtained in this assay with these media without parasites plus CPRG-detergent solution. The differences before and after adding CPRG are significant but do not interfere with the assay with parasites (Supplemental Table S2).",
    "In statistical analysis software, plot the concentration of BZN (in µM) versus the absorbance at 595 nm in an xy table. Transform the BZN concentrations to logarithmic values by clicking on the Analyze button, selecting the Transform option | transform the x-values using x=log(x) option, and clicking the Ok button.\nObtain the IC50 values from the statistical analysis software.\n\t\tNOTE: The IC50 is defined as the drug concentration that reduces parasite growth by 50% compared to the untreated control and is calculated as the inflection point of the sigmoidal function that fits the curve.\n\t\t\nIn the statistical analysis software, click on the Analyze button, select Non-linear regression (curve fit) in the xy analysis list, and click Ok.\nIn the model tab of the Parameters window, in the dose-response - inhibition group of built-in equations, select the option dose-response method: log(inhibitor) vs. response - Variable Slope (four parameters). Leave all the other tabs at default values; click Ok.\nClick on the results section of the statistical analysis software to find the IC50 value, the SD, and the goodness of the fit.\nClick on the graph section to find the xy graph of the logarithmic concentration of the drug versus the absorbance values. Look for the curve fit is also graphed in a different color.\n\t\t\tNOTE: A free online IC50 calculation tool can be found at https://www.aatbio.com/tools/ic50-calculator.\nSubscription Required.
