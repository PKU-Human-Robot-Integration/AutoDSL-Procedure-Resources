    "RNA isolationNotes: Isolate no less than 500 ng RNA from Mus musculus adult whole tibialis anterior (TA) skeletal muscle (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180828/20180828202809_4392.jpgFigure 1. Image of tibialis anterior (TA) anatomy and dissection. Dashed red lines represent location of the TA. A. Location of TA prior to the removal of fur; B. Location of TA prior to dissection of the muscle; C. TA is cut from the tendon near the foot and pulled up towards the knee. D. Image of fully dissected TA.Maintenance of RNase-free conditions are imperative to high quantity and quality yield of RNA from tissue, and surfaces can be cleaned with RNaseZapTM. RNA will be used for microarray analysis and cDNA synthesis. Expect yield > 4 μg RNA/sample Dissect TA muscle or tissue of interest from respective mouse specimen (Figures 1A-1D).Weigh TA muscle, flash freeze in liquid nitrogen and add 1 ml of TRIzolTM reagent per 50-100 mg of tissue in 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tube.Use a tissue homogenizer to homogenize the tissue for 2-3 sec at a time, placing the sample on ice to ensure it does not over-heat. The sample should be homogenized until no clear pieces of tissue are visible, approximately 2-4 times.Optional: clear lysate by centrifugation for 5 min at 4 °C and 12,000 x g and transfer supernatant to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (approximate volume ~800 μl).Incubate the sample at room temperature for 5 min.Add 0.2 ml of chloroform per 1 ml of TRIzolTM reagent used, and shake or vortex vigorously for 15 sec. Then incubate the sample at room temperature for 3 min.Centrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C and 12,000 x g to separate phases.",
    "Transfer the aqueous phase (clear, upper phase Figure 2) containing the RNA to a new tube using a 1 ml pipette (volume ~400-600 μl), making sure not to transfer any of the interphase or phenol-chloroform phase.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180828/20180828202832_7070.jpgFigure 2. Image of phase separation following TRIzolTM reagent RNA extraction. Aqueous phase (gray) contains RNA and is to be carefully transferred into a fresh tube for downstream isolation.Add 0.5 ml of isopropanol per 1 ml of TRIzolTM reagent used to the aqueous phase containing RNA from Step A8 and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.Centrifuge sample for 10 min at 4 °C and 12,000 x g to precipitate RNA (RNA should form a white pellet at the bottom of the tube).Discard the supernatant being careful not to disturb the pellet.Resuspend pellet in 1 ml of 75% ethanol per 1 ml of TRIzolTM reagent used to wash the RNA pellet.Gently shake sample briefly and centrifuge for 5 min at 4 °C and 7,500 x g.Carefully discard supernatant, removing as much ethanol as possible without disturbing the pellet.Air-dry pellet for maximum 5-10 min at room temperature. Make sure that the ethanol has evaporated but do not let the pellet dry for too long as residual ethanol and over-drying both may affect RNA quality. Resuspend pellet in 50 μl of RNase-free water (imperative if being used for downstream microarray analysis).Measure concentration and the ratio of A260/A280 using NanoDrop Spectrophotometer.Notes:One milligram of the sample should yield roughly 1 μg of RNA. The ratio of A260/A280 in the range of 1.85-1.95 is required for downstream applications, and the RNA sample quality should be checked using the Agilent bioanalyzer. Determination of the quality of RNA sample on an Agilent bioanalyzer should yield two large peaks corresponding to the 18S and 28S ribosomal subunits (Peterson et al., 2009).",
    "Examples of good and poor quality RNA are shown in Figure 3. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180828/20180828202849_5431.jpgFigure 3. Images of intact (ideal), partially degraded and degraded RNA samples as determined by using the Agilent BioAnalyzer. The top panel clearly shows two peaks which correspond to the 18S and 28S ribosomal subunits, a small peak to a spike-in control and otherwise smooth lines. The middle and bottom panels represent degraded RNA in which the 18S and 28S peaks may or may not be clear and are usually preceded by multiple smaller peaks (indicative of degraded RNA). The x- and y-axis are nucleotides and fluorescence, respectively.Transcriptomic Microarray AnalysisMicroarray methods and analysis are adapted from the manufacturer’s manuals (Agilent, Two-Color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis–Low Input Quick Amp Labeling) Preparation of Spike A Mix and Spike B Mix as positive controls, all procedures should be done in an RNase-free environment to ensure stability of RNA, following steps can be done in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Vortex and heat Spike A and B Mix at 37 °C for 5 min upon arrival and briefly centrifuge.To dilute Spike A Mix (for example) prepare first dilution by adding 2 μl of Spike A Mix to 38 μl dilution buffer, mix, and briefly spin down (dilution is 1:20).Dilute solution from Step B1 b by adding 2 μl of diluted solution to 78 μl dilution buffer, mix, and briefly spin down (dilution is 1:40).Dilute solution from Step B1 c by adding 2 μl of diluted solution to 30 μl dilution buffer, mix, and briefly spin down (dilution is 1:16).Dilute solution from Step B1 d by adding 4 μl of diluted solution to 28 μl dilution buffer, mix, and briefly spin down (dilution is 1:8).",
    "Add 2 μl of final diluted solution (final dilution is 1:102,400) to 25-100 ng of sample RNA (volume should not exceed 3.5 μl).Repeat for Spike B Mix for other RNA samples (i.e., RNA from wild-type sample vs. RNA from experimental sample) and proceed with labeling reaction.Labeling reaction, purification and quantification of fluorescently labeled complementary RNA (cRNA) Note: For Spike A prepare with Cyanine 3-CTP and Spike B Cyanine 5-CTP dye otherwise both samples are treated the same. Have water baths or heating blocks set to 65 °C and 80 °C prior to starting procedure for Steps B2a-B2d (below). Prepare T7 primer mix by combining 1.8 μl T7 primer to 1 μl nuclease-free water per reaction.Add 1.8 μl T7 primer mix to each tube and incubate at 65 °C for 10 min, gently shaking the tube every couple of minutes.Remove the reactions from heat and place on ice for 5 min.In the meantime, pre-warm the 5x first strand buffer at 80 °C for 3-4 min, vortex and spin down so that the buffer components are fully re-suspended.Assemble the following cDNA reaction on ice in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube (scaling up according to the number of reactions with one reaction in excess to correct for pipetting error):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180828/20180828203910_2275.jpgAdd 4.7 μl cDNA reaction to each tube containing RNA + Spike Mix (final volume is 10 μl), mix by pipetting and briefly spin down.Pre-heat blocks to 42 °C and 70 °C 10 min prior to use to ensure temperature reaches desired degrees (i.e., 42 °C and 70 °C). Incubate reaction at 40 °C for 2 h then heat inactivate reaction at 70 °C for 15 min (occasionally shaking tube or using a circulating water bath).",
    "Place the sample on ice for 5 min and in the meantime prepare the transcription master mix reactions (scaling up according to the number of reactions) as follows to amplify and fluorescently label the RNA:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180828/20180828204015_5140.jpgAdd 6 μl of transcription reaction to Spike A Mix or Spike B Mix (final volume per reaction now 16 μl), mix by pipetting up and down and incubate at 40 °C for 2 h.Using the RNeasy Mini Kit, purify the cRNA from each reaction (protocol below as summarized per the manufacturer’s instructions)Bring volume of cRNA reaction to 100 μl with nuclease-free water.Add 350 μl of RLT and mix well.Add 250 μl of 100% ice cold ethanol and mix by gently pipetting.Transfer reaction to spin column, place in a collection tube and centrifuge at 16,000 x g and 4 °C for 30 sec.Discard flow through and add 500 μl of RPE buffer to the column, centrifuge at 16,000 x g and 4 °C for 30 sec.Repeat Steps B2j-B2k v but centrifuge at 16,000 x g and 4 °C for 60 sec.Place column in a fresh collection tube and centrifuge at 16,000 x g and 4 °C for 30 sec to remove and remaining buffer.Place column in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and add 30 μl of RNase-free water to the column.Incubate at room temperature for 1-2 min and then centrifuge at 16,000 x g and 4 °C for 30 sec.Optional: re-elute with eluate to increase yield.Measure RNA concentration and quality with a NanoDropTM ND-1000 UV-VIS Spectrophotometer version 3.2.1 or higher.1)Use 'Microarray Measurement' tab and select RNA-40 as sample type.2)Record cyanine 3 or 5 concentration, RNA absorbance ratio and cRNA concentration (RNA absorbance ratio [260/280 nm] should be 1.9 ± 0.04 and cRNA concentration should yield at minimum 1.875 μg if using 2-pack format).",
    "Hybridization of sample and probesPreparation of 10x blocking: add 1,250 μl of nuclease-free water to the 10x gene expression blocking agent (supplied with the kit) and gently vortex to dissolve powder completely.Note: If powder does not readily dissolve, heat blocking agent at 37 °C for 4-5 min. Assemble the following reaction in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.Note: The reaction below and subsequent volumes are for 2-pack microarray, for 1-pack, 4-pack or 8-pack refer to refer to Agilent’s Two-color Microarray-Based Gene Expression Analysis Protocol. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180828/20180828204052_6473.jpgIncubate at 60 °C for 30 min then place reaction on ice.Add equal volume 2x Hi-RPM Hybridization Buffer to stop reaction and mix well, being careful to not introduce any bubbles.Briefly spin sample down and place on ice for immediate downstream use.Load gasket slide into Agilent SureHyb (Figures 4B and 4C) chamber base with label facing up.Slowly add 240 μl of sample onto the gasket well from left to right, being careful not to introduce any air bubbles.Make 1x solution from 2x Hi-RPM Hybridization Buffer in any wells that remain unused.Place the slide with the ‘active’ side down, such that the Agilent-labeled barcode is facing down and the numeric barcode facing upwards.Place the SureHyb chamber cover onto the slides, clamp both pieces and tighten.Double-check that there are no stationary bubbles and, if needed, tap on surface to remove.Note: bubbles may be a source of artifacts as they may impact signal intensity. Load the chamber onto the rotator rack in the hybridization oven, set it to rotate at 10 rpm and hybridize at 65 °C for 17 h.Washing microarray slidesTo prepare the Wash Buffers, remove outer and inner caps from container and use a pipette to add 2 ml of Triton X-102 to gene expression Wash Buffers 1 and 2.",
    "Mix by inversion and replace the original outer and inner caps with the spigot provided with the kit.Pre-warm gene expression Wash Buffer 2 to 37 °C before proceeding with washing the arrays.Wash the staining dish prior to use as follows (repeat 2 x):Add slide rack and stir bar to staining dish and fill the dish with 100% isopropyl alcohol (Figure 4A).Turn on magnetic stir plate to wash for 5 min.Rinse staining dish with Milli-Q water multiple times.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180828/20180828202909_3463.jpgFigure 4.

Individual parts of the SureHyb assembly kit. Top is the chamber, the microarray slide sits on top of it and the cover (middle) is gently placed on top. The clamp (bottom) is then used to ensure the slide and chamber stay tightly together. D. Image of microarray slides, the visible barcodes clearly state “Agilent” and are to be used for proper orientation.Prepare staining dishes as followsFill slide-staining dish #1 with gene expression Wash Buffer 1.Place slide rack into slide-staining dish #2 and add magnetic stir bar, fill with gene expression Wash Buffer 1 and place on a magnetic plate.Place dish #3 on the stir plate, add a stir bar and only fill with pre-warmed gene expression Wash Buffer 2 immediately before use.Remove hybridization chamber from the rotating incubator and note any bubbles that may have formed during hybridization.Disassemble the hybridization chamber by placing it on a flat surface, remove the array-gasket while maintaining the numeric barcode facing up and immediately submerge it in slide-staining dish #1.Keeping the array-gasket sandwich submerged, pry open the sandwich with forceps and let the gasket slide drop to the bottom of the dish.",
    "Remove the slide and place it into the slide rack in slide-staining dish #2, being careful to only touch the slide over the numeric barcode or along the thin edges.Repeat these steps for the remaining slides.Incubate the slide on the magnetic stir plate for 1 min.Add slide rack to slide-staining dish #3 and incubate on the magnetic stir plate for 1 min.Slowly and carefully remove slide rack and place slides on the slide holder.Add the slide without the barcode label towards the edge.Active microarray surface should be facing up towards the slide cover.Close the plastic cover.Proceed to scanning slides.Scanning microarray slides, feature selection and data collectionPlace the slide holder containing slide into the scanner cassette.Select the ‘AgilentG3_HiSen_GX_2color’ protocol.Click ‘Start scan’.Open Agilent Feature Extraction (FE) and add the images to be extracted to the FE project (default settings for project ok).Note: Manual grid mapping may be required. Save the Feature Extraction project as .fep via File > Save As.Select Project > Start Extracting.Validation of microarray resultsGene-specific primer design for real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR): selection of amplicon size, primers and template are imperative to generating reproducible data that can accurately determine if the results from the microarray are validatedNote: Pre-validated gene expression assays can be purchased from a variety of vendors and thus do not require optimization. For genes that are not available or have not been previously validated, primers efficiency should be evaluated (see below):Select genes based on the microarray results. Candidate genes should be chosen based on genes that displayed a significant change across conditions and a reference gene should be chosen that did not display any change in expression across samples (for the latter examples include 18S rRNA or β-actin).Amplicons targeted by primer should be approximately equal in size (not greater than 0.",
    "6 kb) and the secondary structures of the target sites can be determined using nucleic acid-folding software such as OligoAnalyzer 3.1 (IDT), as highly structured sequences can impact qPCR efficiency and results.Primers target sites should be analyzed by in silico PCR tools such as NCBI BLAST or UCSC Genome Browser to determine specificity.Each primer should have roughly the same melting temperature, however the exact ideal annealing temperature must be determined experimentally.cDNA synthesisOne to five microgram of template RNA from tissue samples assayed in microarray analysis required (use both biological and technical replicates here; the former being another mouse sample under the same condition and the latter the same RNA that was used for microarray analysis), and quality should be determined prior to cDNA synthesis.Thaw reagents from M-MLV RT kit, vortex and centrifuge briefly.Assemble the following reaction on ice in the respective order:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180828/20180828204126_2546.jpgGently flick PCR tubes to mix contents, briefly centrifuge and incubate at 65 °C for 5 min then place on ice immediately.Add the following components to the reaction in the respective order:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180828/20180828204149_1439.jpgMix reaction by pipetting up and down and incubate at 25 °C for 10 min.Incubate reaction at 37 °C for 50 min.Heat inactivate reaction at 70 °C for 15 min.Resulting cDNA can be used immediately for real-time PCR analysis or stored at -20 °C.Real-time qPCR of candidate target genesNote: Important to set up biological and technical replicates as well as a negative control containing no template. 3 biological replicates (i.e., three RNA/cDNA samples from three different mice), 3 technical replicates (i.e., using the same RNA to generate cDNA) suggested per sample. Primers should be re-hydrated in nuclease-free water and stored at a stock concentration of 10 μM.",
    "Thaw reagents on ice and prepare the following reaction on ice (multiply the final reaction volume by the number of PCR reactions planned plus to [to account for pipetting error] create a master mix that can be aliquoted into Roche LightCycler 480 plates).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180828/20180828204208_7331.jpgGeneral Real-time Quantitative PCR cycler settings.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180828/20180828204242_3920.jpgCq values can then be analyzed for primer efficiency and subsequent fold-change in target gene expression (Cq values > 35 are not recommended to use).Note: Samples requiring over 35 cycles may not provide reliable results and indicate that the cDNA quality or reaction efficiency is poor. While some very lowly expressed genes may yield a Cq value between 35-40, under those conditions it is imperative the negative control produces no signal at that cycle number"
