If the supernatant is still turbid/hazy, perform an additional washing step.\nEndothelial cell enrichment using CD31 murine MicroBeads\nResuspend the pellet in an appropriate amount of Wash Buffer 1 and add the appropriate volume of CD31 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-097-418) to the suspension according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nNote: We suggest to resuspend the cells in 90 μL of Wash Buffer 1, determine the cell number and follow the manufacturer's instructions (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/cd31-microbeads-mouse.html?countryRedirected=1#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/cd31-microbeads-mouse.html?countryRedirected=1#gref]) i.e., for up to 1 × 107 total cells, resuspend the cells the cells in 90 μL of Wash Buffer 1 and add 10 μL of CD31 MicroBeads. If fewer than 1 × 107 cells are available use the same volumes as indicated above. When working with higher cell numbers than 1 × 107 cells, scale up all reagent volumes and total volumes accordingly.\nNote: In case the sample is too viscous or contains clumps, filter through 70 μm cell strainer (do not filter if not necessary).\nMix well and incubate for 20 min at 4°C.\nNote: Process samples fast in order to avoid non-specific binding of beads at 20°C–22°C.\nWash cells by adding 3 mL of Wash Buffer 1 and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.",
    "During the centrifugation step prepare collection tubes and LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-042-401) according to the manufacturer's instructions (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/ls-columns.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/ls-columns.html#gref]) i.e., place the column in the suitable magnetic separator and prepare the column by rinsing with 3 mL of Wash Buffer.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 0.5 mL of Wash Buffer 1.\nApply the cell suspension onto the prepared LS column through a 40 μm cell strainer to prevent clogging of the column.\nWash the LS column 3 times with 3 mL Wash Buffer 1 adding buffer each time once the column reservoir is empty.\nNote: The eluent (CD31-negative fraction) from step 17f can be used to prepare controls for FACS analysis or can be discarded if not further needed.\nRemove the LS column from the separator and place it onto a new 15 mL conical collection tube.\nPipet 5 mL Wash Buffer 1 onto the LS column. Immediately flush out the fraction containing the magnetically labeled cells (CD31-positive fraction) by firmly applying the plunger supplied with the column.\nFACS CRUCIAL: Prepare all required controls for flow cytometry analysis beforehand i.e., unstained cell (US) control, viability control (VB), Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) control, isotype controls (optional), as well as the compensation controls (one for each fluorophore) for proper set up of the cytometer.\nNote: We recommend to use the cells from the final step of the isolation as controls (US, VB, FMO, isotype controls). However, if the cell number is limited, one can use the cells from, e.g.,: CD31-negative fraction, to prepare the controls. For compensation controls we would recommend to use compensation beads (e.g., OneComp eBeads™ Compensation Beads, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#01-1111-41) to ensure clear fluorescence signal and sufficient compensation.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 g for 5 min and remove the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 0.5 mL Wash Buffer 1-based staining solution containing:\nCD11b Monoclonal Antibody (M1/70), e.g.,: CD11b-PE (BioLegend, Cat#101208) (1:500).\nCD31 (PECAM-1) Monoclonal Antibody (390), e.g.,: CD31-FITC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#11-0311-82; 1:300).\nCD45 Monoclonal Antibody (30-F11), e.g.,: CD45-PE-Cyanine7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#25-0451-82; 1:700).\nViability Dye, e.g.,: eFluor 450 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#65-0863-18; 1:1000).\nStain the cells for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.\nAdd 3 mL of Wash Buffer 1 and centrifuge the stained cells at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C, remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in Wash Buffer 1 (based on the pellet size between 200 μL and 0.5 mL) and proceed with FACS.\nSort viable, CD11b-, and CD31+ cells to collection tubes.\nNote: To ensure high viability of the ECs, sort the ECs to collection medium (10% (v/v) FBS in PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#A38401) in an Eppendorf (∼ 200 μL) or 15 mL conical tube (∼ 2 mL).\nFigure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A shows representative FACS plots and gating strategy of viable, CD11b-, CD31+ liver ECs."
