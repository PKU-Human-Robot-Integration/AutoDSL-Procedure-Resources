    "NOTE: All following steps should be performed in as sterile an environment as possible. Thus, working in front of a Bunsen burner is necessary.\n1. Let E. coli BL21(DE3) cells thaw on ice and aliquot 50 µl into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Quickly re-freeze the tube containing the bacterial stock at −80°C.\n2. Carefully add 50-100 ng plasmid DNA encoding GEPII 1.0 to the 50 µl of bacteria. Mix by carefully moving the pipette tip.\nDo not vortex and do not blow out the remaining liquid from the pipette tip, as this may damage the cells.\n3. Incubate on ice for 30 min.\n4. Heat shock the cells at 42°C for 10 s.\nThe time needed for heat shock may depend on the strain and competence of the bacteria.\n5. Incubate in ice for 5 min.\n6. Add 950 µl SOC medium and incubate at 37°C for 1 h with shaking.\n7. Add 10 ml LB medium containing 50 µg/µl kanamycin sulfate to 15-ml conical tubes. Inoculate with bacterial culture and cultivate overnight at 37°C.\n8. Pipet 350 µl of 50% glycerol solution into sterile 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and add 500 µl bacterial culture. Immediately freeze glycerol stocks at −80°C.\nPrepared glycerol stocks can be used in the future to start directly with induction.\nInduce protein expression\nNOTE: From this point on, avoid excessive light exposure at all steps to prevent photobleaching of the fluorescent proteins.\n9. Inoculate 1 L LB medium (with kanamycin) with transformed bacterial culture and incubate with shaking at 37°C until the OD600 reaches 0.6-0.8 (typically, 4-6 hr).\n10. Add 1 mM IPTG and incubate for 4-6 hr at 20°C with shaking to induce protein expression.\nAfter 4-6 hr, bacteria should have a slightly green to yellow color caused by expression of GEPII 1.0.",
    "11. Transfer bacterial suspension to centrifuge tubes and pellet cells at 7,800 × g (6,000 rpm in Sorvall LYNX Superspeed centrifuge) for 10 min at 4°C.\n12. Remove supernatant and resuspend pelleted cells in 15 ml lysis buffer.\nIf desired, resuspended cells can be frozen at −80°C. Frozen cells should be thawed in a 37°C water bath before use.\nPrepare cell lysate\n13. Add 250 U Benzonase nuclease and 150 µl bacterial protease inhibitor cocktail (1:100 dilution) to the cell suspension and incubate on ice for 30 min.\n14. Break up cells by sonicating for 20 min on ice. Perform 10 s of sonication followed by 10 s of pause over a period of 20 min.\nAvoid touching the tube with the sonicator or the tube will be damaged and the probe lost. Keep suspension on ice to prevent damage from heat generated during sonication.\n15. Centrifuge at 17,200 × g (10,000 rpm in Sorvall LYNX) for 45 min at 4°C to pellet cell debris.\n16. Transfer supernatant to 15-ml conical tubes and keep on ice. Discard pelleted debris.\nIf desired, centrifuged supernatant can be frozen at −80°C. Frozen supernatant should be thawed in a 37°C water bath before use.\nPerform nickel affinity chromatography\n17. Load an Econo-Pac Chromatography column with 3 ml pre-charged Protino Ni-NTA agarose.\nNickel-agarose should never be allowed to dry out. Columns can be stored in column storage buffer.\n18. Equilibrate column by filling to the top with lysis buffer (15 ml) and letting the buffer flow through.\nIf the next step cannot be performed immediately after equilibration, re-cap the column with a remaining volume of 2 ml lysis buffer on the beads or refill it to the top to prevent drying.\n19. Apply cell lysate to the column by carefully decanting or pipetting it.",
    "Avoid disturbing the beads, as this may reduce the efficiency of protein binding.\n20. Allow the lysate to flow through the column.\nThe blue nickel beads may change color upon protein binding.\nThe maximum flow rate should be 1 ml/min. If the flow rate is too high, it may be necessary to re-apply the flowthrough to the column to ensure optimal binding of the protein.\n21. Wash column once each with 15 ml wash buffer 1 and then 15 ml wash buffer 2.\nThe pH of both buffers must be adjusted to 8.0, as lower pH values may lead to elution of the protein.\n22. Elute protein with 15 ml of high-salt purification buffer.\nIf desired, the protein solution can be frozen in liquid nitrogen and further steps can be performed on the next day. Frozen eluate should be quickly thawed in a 37°C water bath before use.\n23. Concentrate the protein solution using Vivaspin concentrator tubes according to manufacturer's instructions. Centrifuge at 2,300 × g (4,000 rpm in Eppendorf centrifuge) for 20 min at 4°C. Repeat centrifugation until a volume of 500 µl protein remains in the collector.\nDiscard the flowthrough after each centrifugation if there is too much liquid at the bottom of the tube.\nThe protein is now concentrated enough to be applied to the size-exclusion column.\nPerform size-exclusion chromatography\nNOTE: Other FPLC systems may be used, but the protocol may vary depending on the system.\n24. Insert a Superdex 200 increase 10/300 GL column into the Äkta pure system according to manufacturer's instructions.\n25. Choose the “inlet” and “column position” and define the “system flow”. Set the column position at “Bypass” to avoid applying any impurities onto the column during washing.",
    "Inlet defines the tube that is connected to the equilibration buffer (SEC buffer). System flow is set to 0.5 ml/min.\n26. Wash the selected pump system with SEC buffer.\n27. Under “monitors”, select “wavelengths” to define the wavelengths that are shown on the screen. Set wavelength to 480 nm to screen for the yellow fluorescent GEPII 1.0 protein.\n28. Set “alarms” according to the used column. Define the pre-column pressure and the delta column pressure.\n29. Press “execute” to wash the system without the column.\n30. Select the “manual load” option on the injection loop and apply 5 ml SEC buffer with a syringe onto the loop.\n31. Switch from “manual load” to “inject” to wash the loop.\nEvery loop has a defined volume that is retained in the loop. Any excess volume will flow into the waste. For 500 µl protein solution, use a 1-ml loop to ensure that the protein is not lost during application.\n32. Change back to “manual load” on the loop and then remove the syringe.\nDo not remove the syringe without changing back to “manual load” or air will be trapped in the system.\n33. Change from the “bypass” position to the actual column position and allow 30 ml SEC buffer to flow through the column to wash and equilibrate it.\nAll solutions and buffers will now pass through the column.\n34. With “manual load” selected in the software, use a small syringe to load protein solution from the concentrator tubes onto the loop. Be careful to avoid any air bubbles.\n35. Change to “inject” to apply the protein onto the column. After ∼6 ml, start the fractionation to collect fractions containing protein.\n36. Combine fractions containing protein and determine the protein concentration using a method of choice.",
    "37. Calculate the molarity of the protein solution.\nGEPII 1.0 has a size of ∼70 kDa.\nVerify functionality of purified GEPII 1.0\n38. Dilute GEPII 1.0 in dilution buffer to a concentration of 400 nM and then pipet 40 µl into 14 wells of a black 96-well plate.\n39. Add 40 µl of the following K+ calibration solutions to duplicate wells: 60 µM, 200 µM, 600 µM, 2 mM, 6 mM, and 20 mM. Add 40 µl dilution buffer to the last two wells as a blank.\nThe final [K+] in the wells will be 0 µM, 30 µM, 100 µM, 300 µM, 1 mM, 3 mM, and 10 mM.\n40. Measure all wells using the CLARIOstar Plus fluorescence plate reader with the following settings:\n         \nExcitation: 430-20 nm\nEmission: 475-10 and 525-10 nm\nDichroic filters: 455 and 480 nm\nGain: 2,000 for both emissions with focal height adjusted to blank\nTop optics\n41. Calculate FRET ratio values of all wells by determining the FRET/CFP fluorescence (525 nm/475 nm).\n42. Determine the average FRET ratio value from the blank wells and subtract it from the value for each well containing K+ calibration solution. Plot the blank-corrected FRET/CFP ratios (ΔRatio) against [K+] both linearly and logarithmically and determine the EC50.\nIf GEPII 1.0 is functional, a concentration-dependent increase in the FRET ratio should be observed, with an EC50 of ∼500-600 µM at room temperature, as shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.71#cpch71-fig-0002].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/afe436c9-21a3-44f4-904b-7499a272a331/cpch71-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nTesting the functionality of recombinant purified GEPII 1.0. Blank-corrected FRET ratio signals (ΔRatio(FRET/CFP)) of GEPII 1.0 are plotted against [K+], both linearly (A) and logarithmically (B), in mM. The EC50 of GEPII 1.0 determined by sigmoidal concentration-response curve fitting is indicated in (B). n = 2 experiments.",
    "43. If GEPII 1.0 has proven functional, prepare aliquots as desired and shock-freeze in liquid nitrogen. Store up to 2 years at −80°C in the dark. If protein has been stored for >1 year, it is recommended to repeat the functionality tests (steps 38-42) before use.",
    "The following protocol describes how to collect murine blood by phlebotomy from v. facialis and how to prepare murine serum samples. Furthermore, presents the generation of a K+ calibration curve for GEPII 1.0 and the determination of [K+] in murine serum samples using GEPII 1.0.\nGenerally, mice (e.g., wild-type C57BL/6) should be maintained in a clean environment with a regular light-dark cycle (12 hr/12 hr) and unrestricted access to food and water. The mouse strain as well as conditions can be modified as needed to suit the experimental design.\nMaterials\nMice\nDilution buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.71#cpch71-rec-0005])\nSerum assay solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.71#cpch71-rec-0016])\nK+ calibration solutions (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.71#cpch71-rec-0010])\nK+ standard solutions (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.71#cpch71-rec-0011])\nMediware blood lancets (Servoprax, cat. no. 10947551)\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 11926955)\nSterile gauze\nMicrocentrifuge (Himac CT15RE, Koki Holdings, cat.no 90560701)\nBlack, F-bottom 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, cat. no. 655086)\nFluorescence plate reader (CLARIOstar Plus, BMG Labtech)\nCollect blood and prepare serum samples\n1. On the day of sample collection, remove mouse from its environment and restrain it securely by grasping the neck scruff with the thumb and index finger and holding the base of the tail between the palm and the ring finger.\n2. Puncture the superficial temporal vein using a sterile single-use lancet.\n3. Collect blood from the second drop (∼20-30 µl) into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\n4. Lightly press the puncture site with a sterile gauze for a few seconds to cause hemostasis. Release mouse from restraint and return to its home cage.\n5. Repeat for the desired number of mice.\n6. Allow blood samples to clot for 15 min at room temperature.",
    "7. Centrifuge samples for 10 min at 400 × g to separate the blood clot from the serum. Carefully transfer serum to a new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, taking care not to disturb the pelleted blood clot, and place on ice.\nIMPORTANT: If the blood clot is mixed with the serum, start over with a fresh blood sample.\n8. Visually check sera for hemolysis.\nIf samples are discolored red, hemolysis may have occurred. If hemolysis is visible, be careful with these samples, as the lysis of red blood cells drastically increases the [K+]. When in doubt, exclude these samples and start over with fresh blood samples.\nSerum samples are ready for analysis and can be can be analyzed directly or stored for up to 1 year at −20°C. For direct analysis, samples should be maintained on ice.\nGenerate standard curve\n9. Pipet 40 µl serum assay solution into the number of wells of a 96-well plate needed to generate the calibration curve.\nTo generate the calibration curve, we recommend using at least triplicate wells for each concentration. Thus, if the calibration curve consists of a blank and six K+ concentrations, 21 wells are required to generate the calibration curve.\n10. Add 40 µl of each K+ calibration solution (200 µM, 300 µM, 400 µM, 500 µM, 600 µM, and 700 µM) to triplicate wells containing 40 µl serum assay solution. For blank wells, use 40 µl dilution buffer.\nThe final [K+] in the wells will be 0 µM, 100 µM, 150 µM, 200 µM, 250 µM, 300 µM, and 350 µM.",
    "Be very careful with pipetting. GEPII 1.0 is highly sensitive for K+ and slight deviations or pipetting mistakes will drastically affect the calibration curve, leading to errors in calculating [K+] from the serum samples. Avoid air bubbles in pipetting, as they may alter fluorescence measurements. If air bubbles have been produced, try to destroy them using sterile needles.\n11. Measure samples using a CLARIOstar Plus fluorescence plate reader with the following settings. Be sure to remove the lid from the plate before taking measurements.\n         \nExcitation: 430-20 nm\nEmission: 475-10 and 525-10 nm\nDichroic filters: 455 and 480 nm\nGain: 2,000 for both emissions with focal height adjusted to blank\nTop optics\n12. Calculate the FRET ratio by determining the FRET/CFP fluorescence (525 nm/475 nm) of each well containing K+ calibration solution. Plot the FRET/CFP ratio versus [K+] as demonstrated in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.71#cpch71-fig-0003]A.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/00ca1c80-9331-4b38-829c-b45f848c3f92/cpch71-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nGeneration of a calibration curve suitable for quantification of [K+] in serum samples. (A) FRET ratio signals of GEPII 1.0 are plotted against [K+] (n = 3) before (A) and after (B) blank correction. Data were fitted using a one-phase decay. The equation for the curve and R2 are indicated in (B). (C) Formula for calculation of [K+] (mM) in serum samples from FRET ratio signals of GEPII 1.0, determined by solving the equation in (B).\n13. Calculate the FRET/CFP ratios of the blank wells, determine the average value, and then subtract that from each value of the calibration curve. Plot the blank-corrected FRET/CFP ratios (ΔRatio) against [K+] as demonstrated in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.71#cpch71-fig-0003]B, and fit the values using a one-phase decay. Create the equation of the curve and solve it for x as demonstrated in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.71#cpch71-fig-0003]C.\nThe formula is afterwards used to calculate the [K+] from the FRET/CFP ratio of GEPII 1.0.",
    "Determine [K+] in serum samples\n14. If serum samples were frozen, thaw them on ice.\n15. Dilute 8 µl of each serum sample and K+ standard solution (5.0 and 8.0 mM) with 92 µl dilution buffer (1:12.5 dilution). Mix by inverting tubes. Do NOT vortex, as vortexing may lead to foaming.\nThe optimal dilution factor may vary depending on the expected [K+] within the samples. The final [K+] in the wells needs to fall within the range of the calibration curve. For murine serum, one can expect [K+] to be 5-8 mM. The initial dilution of 1:12.5 yields [K+] of 400-640 µM. A further 1:2 dilution with serum assay solution gives a final assay dilution of 1:25 (200-320 µM).\nWe recommend including at least two K+ standards as internal standards.\n16. For each [K+] determination, pipet 40 µl serum assay solution into duplicate wells of a 96-well plate. Include duplicate wells for the blank and both K+ standards.\nWe recommend performing all [K+] determinations at least in duplicate.\n17. Add 40 µl of each diluted sample and standard to the wells containing serum assay solution. Use dilution buffer for the blank wells.\nAvoid air bubbles during pipetting, as air bubbles may alter the fluorescence measurements. If air bubbles have been produced, try to destroy them using sterile needles.\n18. Measure fluorescence as in step 11.\nIf you have generated a calibration curve earlier and did not use the indicated settings, do not change the measurement parameters! The samples and calibration curve must be measured with the same device settings.\n19. Calculate the FRET ratio by determining the FRET/CFP fluorescence (525 nm/475 nm) for each well.\n20. Determine the average for the blank wells and subtract it from each sample and standard.",
    "21. Verify the accuracy of the internal standards (K+ standard solutions) by calculating [K+] in mM using the formula generated from the calibration curve, as shown in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.71#cpch71-fig-0003]C.\nInternal standards may vary ±5% of the target value. If K+ standard values deviate strongly, several parameters may have to be checked. See Critical Parameters and Troubleshooting for details.\n22. If the [K+] of the standards is within range, continue to calculate the [K+] for the samples. Determine the average of the duplicates for each sample and present data as desired.\nExample data from sera of six animals are presented in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.71#cpch71-fig-0004].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/da9ee96e-5469-4de3-a547-79ef67b4b447/cpch71-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\n[K+] in serum samples of six C57BL/6 mice determined using GEPII 1.0.

    "2. One day before the experiment, wash cells with PBS and trypsinize them. For a 10-cm dish, use ∼3 ml trypsin solution and incubate 2-4 min in a humidified 37°C incubator.\n3. Suspend floating cells in 10 ml medium to stop trypsinization.\n4. Transfer suspension to a 30-ml multipurpose container and centrifuge at 200 × g for 10 min (3,000 rpm in Sorvall RT6000B).\n5. Remove supernatant and wash cells with 10 ml PBS, centrifuging again at 200 × g for 10 min.\n6. Remove PBS, carefully resuspend cell pellet in 10 ml supplemented RPMI 1640, and place on ice to prevent cell adherence.\n7. Determine cell density (number/ml) using a Bürker-Türk counting chamber or any other method of choice. Adjust to ∼250,000 cells/ml.\n8. Seed 200 µl suspension (∼50,000 cells) in the desired number of wells of a black 96-well cell culture plate with a clear bottom. For each condition, include at least two wells containing 200 µl medium alone (no cells) for blank measurements.\n9. Culture cells overnight, then check cell density. Proceed to the next step when cells are 70%-80% confluent.\nPerform assay\n10. Wash wells twice with 250 µl cell wash buffer.\n11.

Use at least two blank wells per condition.\nCAUTION: Be careful with pipetting. The more exact the volume is in each well, the better the results will be, as the [K+] in the supernatant is dependent on the volume of the supernatant.\n12. Measure CFP and FRET signals of GEPII 1.0 over time using a CLARIOstar Plus fluorescence plate reader with the following settings.\n         \nExcitation: 430-20 nm\nEmissions: 475-10 and 525-10 nm\nDichroic filters: 455 and 480 nm",
    "Gain: 2,000 for both emissions with focal height adjusted to blank\nBottom optics\nCAUTION: To prevent evaporation, do not remove the lid from the 96-well plate prior to the measurements.\nThe temporal resolution of the measurement will depend on the cell treatment. The faster the cells are expected to undergo cell death, the higher the temporal resolution needed.\n13. At the end of measurement, add 5 µl of 850 µM digitonin stock solution to all wells including blanks (final 50 µM).\nApplication of digitonin will permeabilize all cell membranes and is important in order to ensure the same cell numbers under all conditions.\n14. Calculate the FRET ratio signal of GEPII 1.0 by determining the FRET/CFP fluorescence (525 nm/475 nm) for all wells including blanks.\n15. Perform blank correction of FRET ratio signals from wells containing cells using the respective blanks. If several wells were used as a blank, calculate the average blank value and subtract it from each well of the respective condition.\n16. Analyze and present the FRET ratio signal of GEPII 1.0 over time as demonstrated in Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.71#cpch71-fig-0005].",
    "The following protocol describes how to quantify the number of dead cells using recombinant GEPII 1.0 for quantification of extracellular [K+]. Refer to Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.71#cpch71-prot-0003] for all materials needed.\nPrepare cells\n1. Cultivate cells of interest to a confluency of ∼80% using the appropriate culture medium and a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nIt is critical to note that the determined regression curve and formula are cell-type specific and are not applicable for other cell lines than the one used to generate them. The sample data in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.71#cpch71-fig-0006] were generated using HeLa cells cultured in DMEM (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.71#cpch71-rec-0006]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b602d389-ee8e-437e-a284-37ea61c96d5f/cpch71-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nGeneration of a calibration curve for calculating cell number from the FRET ratio signal of GEPII 1.0. (A) Increasing numbers of HeLa cells in DMEM were seeded into the wells of a 96-well plate. After cell permeabilization using 50 µM digitonin, the FRET ratio signal of GEPII 1.0 was recorded. Blank-corrected FRET ratio signal (ΔRatio(FRET/CFP)) is plotted against cell number. Values were fitted using a one-phase decay. The equation of the curve and R2 value are indicated. n = 3 for each cell number. (B) Formula for calculating cell number from the ΔFRET ratio signal of GEPII 1.0 obtained by solving the equation demonstrated in (A).\n2. On the day of the experiment, wash cells with PBS and trypsinize them. For a 10-cm dish, use ∼3 ml trypsin solution and incubate 2-4 min in a humidified 37°C incubator.\n3. Suspend floating cells in 10 ml medium to stop trypsinization.\n4. Transfer suspension to a 30-ml multipurpose container and centrifuge at 200 × g for 10 min (3,000 rpm in Sorvall RT6000B).\n5. Remove supernatant and wash cells with 10 ml cell wash buffer, centrifuging again at 200 × g for 10 min.",
    "6. Remove supernatant and carefully resuspend cells in 5 ml cell wash buffer.\n7. Determine cell density (number/ml) using a Bürker-Türk counting chamber or any other method of choice.\nCount cells as precisely as possible, as deviations in the assumed cell number will affect the estimated number of dead cells for Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.71#cpch71-prot-0003].\nPerform assay\n8. Dispense increasing cell numbers into the wells of a black 96-well cell culture plate with clear bottom and adjust the volume of each well to 40 µl using cell wash buffer. Include blank wells containing 40 µl cell wash buffer without cells.\nWe recommend performing at least triplicates for each cell number tested. Appropriate cell numbers range from 1,000 to 200,000, depending on cell type. For the example in Figure 6, we used 0, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 40,000, and 80,000 HeLa cells.\n9. Add 35 µl cell assay solution to all wells.\n10. Add 5 µl of 850 µM digitonin stock solution to all wells (final 50 µM) and incubate for 10 min for full permeabilization of all cells.\nApplication of digitonin will permeabilize all cell membranes and allow determination of the K+ released from defined cell numbers.\n11. Measure CFP and FRET signals of GEPII 1.0 over time using the CLARIOstar Plus fluorescence plate reader with the following settings:\n         \nExcitation: 430-20 nm\nEmissions: 475-10 and 525-10 nm\nDichroic filters: 455 and 480 nm\nGain: 2,000 for both emissions with focal height adjusted to blank\nBottom optics\nCAUTION: To prevent evaporation of buffer, do not remove the lid from the 96-well plate prior to measurement.\nIf you have measured cell viability over time earlier and did not use these settings, do not change the measurement parameters! The samples and calibration curve must be measured with the same device settings.",
