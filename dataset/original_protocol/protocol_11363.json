    "1. Generation of Spheroids from Colorectal Cancer Cell Line\nWash HCT 116 (stably transduced to express Cluster of Differentiation 19 (CD19) and Green Fluorescence Protein (GFP)) cell monolayers with phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 5 mL for a 25 cm2 or 10 mL for a 75 cm2 flask). Add trypsin (0.5 mL for a 25 cm2 or 1 mL for a 75 cm2 flask) and incubate cells at 37 °C for 5 min.\nCheck cell detachment under a microscope and neutralize cell dissociation enzyme with complete Roswell Park Memorial Institute 160 medium (RPMI 1640) (RPMI 1640 + 10% FCS + Gentamycin; 10 mL for a 25 cm2 or 20 mL for a 75 cm2 flask).\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 500 x g for 5 min. Remove supernatant using a pipette and resuspend by pipetting up and down several times with 5 mL of complete RPM1 1640 medium.\nCount cells using Trypan blue exclusion on a compatible cell counter.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 500 x g for 5 min. Remove supernatant using a pipette and resuspend in RPMI medium to obtain 5 x 103 cells/mL.\nCoat a 96-well round bottom plate with 100 µL/well of 100 µg/mL of poly-L-lysine (PLL) in PBS during 1 hour at room temperature. Wash twice with PBS and let the plate dry.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a sterile reservoir and dispense 200 µL/well into the PLL-coated 96-well round bottom plates using a multichannel pipette.\nTransfer the plate to the automated imaging apparatus inside an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity).\nLog into the acquisition software, select Schedule To Acquire | Launch Add Vessel | Scan On Schedule | Create Vessel: New.",
    "Select Scan Type: Spheroid. Select the channels of interest: Phase + Brightfield (to follow spheroids growth), Green (to follow tumor signal, acquisition time 300 ms) and Red (to follow apoptosis, acquisition time 400 ms).\nSelect the desired magnification: 10x.\nPick the plate model and its position in the drawer. Select the position of wells to image. Enter the description of the experiment: name, type of cells, number of cells.\nFor the analysis setup, select Defer Analysis Until Later. Right click on the timeline and select Set Selected Scan Group Interval option and set Add scans every to 4 h and For a total of to 24 h. Set the desired starting time (at least 1 h after incubation in the automated imaging apparatus).\nCheck every 2 days for the growth of spheroids by logging into the imaging software.\nPick the View Recent Scans option and double-click on the desired experiment. Select Brightfield in the image channels panel and then use the Measure image features tool to measure the diameter of the spheroids. It takes 6 days for a spheroid to reach the desired size: 0.5 mm of diameter. Add 50 µL of complete RPMI medium per well at day 4 to limit medium evaporation effect.\n2. Generation of CD19 CAR T cells\nExpansion of CD19 CAR T cells\nNOTE: Stable expression of CD19 CAR T cells was acquired by bulk retroviral transduction of the healthy donor PBMCs as previously described16. The retroviral construct coding for CD19 CAR is a second-generation CAR and consists of fmc63 scFv chain, CD8 hinge and transmembrane domain, a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain and finally a CD3ζ domain.",
    "To expand, culture the transduced T cells in the presence of anti-CD3/28 magnetic beads with a cell to bead ratio of 1:1 for 10–11 days. During the expansion, cells are in complete medium (X-VIVO 15, 5% Serum Replacement, and 100 U/mL recombinant human IL-2).\nNOTE: The ideal density for an efficient expansion is 1 to 2 x 106 cells/mL. Depending on the initial number, cells can be expanded in flasks (25 cm2 flasks to 20 mL, 75 cm2 flasks to 40 mL of total volume) in a cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity).\nAs a negative control group for the following assays, include non-transduced PBMCs (will be referred as Mock) to the expansion protocol parallel to the CD19 CAR T cells.\nOn day 3 and onwards, add fresh medium every day and divide the cells into more culture flasks if necessary.\nOn day 10–11, centrifuge cells at 500 x g for 5 min. Remove supernatant and combine all the cells into one 50 mL tube and resuspend the cells in ~30 mL of fresh complete media.\nPlace the 50 mL tube containing the resuspended cells on a magnetic stand to separate the magnetic beads from the culture medium.\nWait for 2–3 min for the beads to collect on the side of the tube.\nRemove the culture medium with a pipette and transfer to a new tube without touching the magnetic bead collection zones.\nRepeat steps regarding the bead removal (2.1.5–2.1.7) once more to limit the number of beads in the final culture medium.\nResuspend and count the cells, adjust the density to 1 to 2 x 106 cells/mL in complete medium.",
    "Rest the cells for at least 4 h up to overnight. Then directly freeze them down at -80 °C and transfer the vials to a liquid nitrogen tank on the following day for long-term storage. Alternatively, one can prolong the rest up to overnight for immediate use.\nCD19 CAR expression control on primary T cells\nCount the number of expanded T cells as the numbers might vary slightly after overnight culture or moderately after freeze/thaw.\nTransfer 5 x 105 cells from both CD19 CAR and Mock primary T cells to separate flow cytometry tubes.\nWash the cells with 200 μL of Flow Buffer (2% FBS in PBS) and centrifuge the tubes at 500 x g for 5 min. Repeat the washing steps to get rid of any artifacts caused by the culture medium.\nPrepare the primary antibody (Biotin Goat Anti-Mouse IgG, F(ab')₂ Fragment Specific) by performing 1:200 dilution in Flow Buffer.\nResuspend the cells in 100 μL of antibody mix per tube and incubate on ice for 15 min. Repeat the previous washing step twice to remove excess antibody.\nPrepare the secondary antibody (Streptavidin-PE) as 1:400 dilution in Flow Buffer.\nResuspend the cells in 100 μL of antibody mix per tube and incubate on ice for 15 min. Repeat the previous washing step twice to get rid of excess antibody.\nResuspend the cells in 200 μL of Flow Buffer per tube and analyze it on a flow cytometer.\nUse Mock T cells to set up the negative and positive gate and analyze CD19 CAR transduced T cells accordingly.\n3. 3D Tumor Spheroid Killing Assay\nAfter 6 days or once spheroids reach the desired size, remove the plate from the incubator. Using a multichannel pipette, gently remove 100 µL/well of complete RMPI 1640 medium from the spheroid plates.",
    "For this step, angle the tips towards the inside wall of the 96-wells plate, avoiding contact with the bottom of the well in order to minimize disturbance of the spheroids. Remaining volume should be around 100 µL.\nPrepare a 1:200 solution of Annexin V red by mixing 50 µL of Annexin V red with 9.95 mL of complete RPMI 1640 medium.\nAdd 100 µL/well of the 1:200 Annexin V red solution.\nTransfer the plate to an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity) for 15 min.\nHarvest the transduced CAR CD19 T cells in a 15 mL tube and centrifuge them at 500 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant using a pipette and resuspend by pipetting up and down several times with 2 mL of complete RPM1 1640 medium.\nCount cells using Trypan blue exclusion on a compatible cell counter.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 500 x g for 5 min. Remove supernatant using a pipette and resuspend in RPMI medium to obtain 2 x 105 cells/mL.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a sterile reservoir and dispense 100 µL/well into a 96-well round bottom spheroid plate using a multichannel pipette.\nTransfer the plate back to the automated imaging apparatus inside an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity).\nLog into the acquisition software, select Schedule To Acquire.\nRight-click on the Scan timeline and select Edit Timeline. Right-click on the scan group and delete it. Right-click on the timeline and select Set Selected Scan Group Interval option and set Add scans every to 1.5 h and For a total of to 24 h.\nSet the desired starting time (at least 1 h after incubation in the automated imaging apparatus). Select Save schedule scans.\n4. Automated Image Analysis",
    "Log into acquisition, pick the View Recent Scans option and select Launch Analysis option. Select Create New Analysis Definition | Analysis Type: Spheroid. Tick the Image channels to analyze (Phase + Brightfield, Green and Red).\nSelect at least 10 representative images: typically, 1 per condition and at least 3 time points (beginning, middle and end of the acquisition).\nPreview the default analyze procedure on the whole image stack.\nModify the parameters for brightfield mask. Typical parameters are: Sensitivity 10, Hole fill 1,000 µm2, min area 1,000 µm2. Preview on the whole image stack and check that the selected parameters detect the spheroids accurately.\nModify the parameters for green mask (GFP). Typical parameters are: Top hat segmentation with radius 200 µm and threshold 3 GCU, Edge split off, Hole fill 5,000 µm2, Adjust size -2 pixels, Area min 3,000 µm2. Preview on the whole image stack and check that the selected parameters detect the spheroids accurately.\nModify the parameters for red mask (Annexin V). Typical parameters are: Top hat segmentation with radius 150 µm and threshold 2 GCU, Edge split off, Hole fill 5,000 µm2, Adjust size 0 pixels, Area min 1,000 µm2. Preview on the whole image stack and check that the selected parameters detect the spheroids accurately.\nLaunch the analyzer.\nOnce the analysis is done, extract the measurement of interest. Select the analyzed file and then the Graph Metrics option. Select the metrics of interest, the scan and the well. Typically, total red and green intensity within brightfield boundaries give the most accurate measurements by restricting the signal of fluorescence to the spheroids boundaries determined by the brightfield mask (Figure 3). Extract selected metrics in several file format by clicking on “Export Data”.",
    "Proceed to the extraction of the images and movies by selecting the analyzed file and then select the Export Images and Movies option. Two options are available, either “As Displayed” to retrieve images and movies as seen on the imaging software (usually composite images), either “As Stored” to retrieve raw data for external analysis through third-part software.\nSubscription Required.
