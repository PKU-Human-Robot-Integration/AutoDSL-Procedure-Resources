    "Acquisition of human semen samples This study utilized existing human specimens (semen) and therefore is not human subjects’ research. The samples were discarded from routine examinations and not linked to any identifiers.Collect semen by dry manual stimulation and ejaculation into sterile 15 ml polypropylene conical tubes. Store samples at room temperature for 30 min to promote liquefaction and then centrifuge for 10 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C to pellet spermatozoa. Remove seminal plasma from spermatozoa-containing pellets. Pellets can be discarded or stored for downstream analysis. Store seminal plasma samples at -80 °C until required for exosome purification by ExoQuick or ultracentrifugation. We have found no discernable difference between the two methods of purification. ExoQuick purification of exosomesThaw seminal plasma samples before centrifuging at 2,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C in a 50 ml conical tube. Transfer supernatant to a new tube and centrifuge again at 10,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C in a 50 ml conical tube to pellet cellular debris.Place clarified seminal plasma in a fresh 50 ml conical tube and add ExoQuick at a ratio of 4:1 (clarified seminal plasma/ExoQuick). Mix by inversion, and incubate at 4 °C overnight (12-24 h). Centrifuge the clarified seminal plasma/ExoQuick mixture at 1,500 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. Remove the supernatant (exosome free clarified seminal plasma and ExoQuick) and repeat centrifugation at 1,500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C without resuspension of the pellet.Remove the residual supernatant. Resuspend the exosome pellet in PBS to 1/10 of the original volume of seminal plasma, quantify protein concentration by Bradford assay, and aliquot.",
    "Ultracentrifugation purification of exosomeDilute clarified seminal plasma 50% in PBS, and ultracentrifuge at 100,000 x g for 2 h at 4 °C to pellet exosomes using an SW41Ti rotor.Wash exosome pellets in PBS three times with ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 30 min per wash (1.5 h). A volume of PBS should be used that completely fills the ultracentrifuge tubes to avoid collapse of the tubes. Resuspend exosomes in PBS to 1/10 of the original volume of seminal plasma, quantify protein concentration by Bradford assay, and aliquot. Fluorescent labeling of exosomes, liposome controls or PBS controlsFluorescently label PBS control, Lipofectamine 2000 derived liposome control, or exosomes using PKH67Green or PKH26Red kits according to manufacturer’s instructions with the following modifications: Add 1 mg of purified exosomes or liposome control or an equivalent volume of PBS to 250 µl of PBS and mix with 250 µl of Diluent C in SW41Ti ultracentrifuge tubes.Add 4 µl of PKH67Green or PKH26Red lipophilic dye to 500 µl of Diluent C in a separate tube at room temperature (RT) in the dark and perform all subsequent steps at RT in the dark.Combine the tube containing dye and Diluent C with the tube containing exosomes or controls in PBS and Diluent C in the SW41Ti ultracentrifuge tube. Rapidly mix by manual pipetting. Incubate for 5 min in the dark at RT and vortex twice during the 5-min incubation. After the 5 min of incubation, add exosome-free FBS in a 1:1 ratio to the ultracentrifuge tube containing dye, exosomes or controls, and Diluent C. Incubate for 1 min to occupy unbound dye.Ultracentrifuge the solution at 100,000 x g for 30 min. Discard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the pellet containing dye-labelled exosomes or controls in PBS, transfer to another SW41Ti ultracentrifuge tube and wash three times by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 x g for 30 min per wash. After each wash, transfer the PBS resuspended pellet to a new SW41Ti ultracentrifuge tube to minimize transfer of unbound dye. A volume of PBS should be used that completely fills the ultracentrifuge tube to avoid collapse of the tube. After the final wash, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in PBS to the original volume of the exosomes. Quantify dye-labelled exosomes or controls using Bradford Protein Assay Kit, aliquot, and store in the dark at -80 °C until use.Cell culture preparation for internalization of fluorescent exosomesGrow human monocytic and lymphocytic cell lines in tissue culture dishes in RPMI supplemented with 10% exosome depleted FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 0.3 mg/ml L-glutamine in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.Grow TZM-bl vaginal epithelial cell lines in tissue culture dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% exosome depleted FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 0.3 mg/ml L-glutamine in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.Grow VK2 and V428 vaginal epithelial cell lines in tissue culture dishes in keratinocyte serum free media supplemented with 0.1 ng/ml prequalified human recombinant Epidermal Growth Factor 1-53, 0.05 mg/ml BPE, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.

    "Expose cells to 25-100 μg/ml of red or green fluorescent exosomes or controls for 0, 3, 6, 9, 12 or 24 h incubation periods in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The incubation of SE with cells should be completed in cell culture media. Final volume of SE incubation with cells will depend on the concentration of exosomes after fluorescent labeling. Wash TZM-bl, VK2 or V428 adherent cells three times in 1 ml PBS in the plate and detach the cells from the plate using 0.5 ml of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA dissociation reagent. Neutralize the trypsin with 0.5 ml 10% exosome free FBS in DMEM. Collect the cells from the wells and transfer to 5 ml polystyrene round-bottom tubes. Wash the cells three times in 1 ml PBS with 5 min centrifugation at 500 x g at 4 °C.Collect monocytic and lymphocytic suspension cells in 5 ml polystyrene round-bottom tubes. Treat with trypsin as described in step E5, and neutralize with 10% exosome free FBS in RPMI. Wash the cells three times in 1 ml PBS with 5 min centrifugation at 500 x g at 4 °C.Assess cellular uptake and exosome internalization kinetics utilizing FACS analysis or confocal microscopy.For FACS analysis:Fix cells for 15 min on ice with 300 μl 2% paraformaldehyde.Wash the cells two times in PBS with 5 min centrifugation at 500 x g in between each wash. Resuspend the cell pellets in 300 μl PBS.Analyze fluorescence using a FACSCalibur or FACSVerse flow cytometer (BD) to detect the PKH67Green (FL-1 or FITC channel, respectively) or PKH26Red (FL-2 or PE channel, respectively) transferred from exosomes to cells during fusion and uptake.

Discard the supernatant before removing the tube from the magnet. Add the SE solution to the washed beads and mix by pipetting. Incubate the SE/beads solution at 4 °C overnight (18-20 h) in a rotating mixer. Centrifuge the SE/beads solution for 3-5 sec. Wash the SE bound beads in 300 μl of 0.1% BSA and mix by pipetting before placing the tube on the magnet for 1 min and discarding the supernatant.Remove the tube from the magnet.
