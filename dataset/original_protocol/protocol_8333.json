    "All technical procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institute of Health's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and EU Directive 2010/63/EU and were approved by the Ethical Committee of KU Leuven.\n1. General Methods for Extracellular Recordings in Awake Behaving Monkeys\nTrain the animals to perform the visual and motor tasks required to address your specific research question. Ensure that the animal is able to flexibly switch between tasks during the same recording session in order to test the neuron extensively and obtain a better understanding of the features driving the neural response (Figure 2-3). \n\t\nTrain the animal in Visually-Guided Grasping (VGG; grasping ‘in the light’) to evaluate the visuomotor components of the response. Note: independently from the task chosen, gradually restrict fluid intake at least three days before the start of the training phase. \n\t\t\nRestrain the monkey’s head for the whole duration of the experimental session.\nIn the first sessions, hold the hand contralateral to the recording chamber at the resting position and help the animal to reach and grasp the object, giving manual reward after each attempt.\nPlace back the monkey’s hand on the resting position at the end of each trial.\nEvery few trials, release the hand of the monkey, and wait a few seconds to observe if the animal initiates the movement spontaneously.\nApply manual reward whenever the monkey reaches towards the object.\nWhen the reaching phase is acquired correctly, help the animal to lift (or pull) the object and reward manually.\nAs in 1.1.1.4 and 1.1.1.5, release the monkey’s hand, and wait a few seconds to observe if the animal initiates the movement spontaneously. Give reward whenever the movement is performed correctly.\nCorrect the reaching, hand position, and wrist orientation as many times as necessary during the procedure.",
    "Repeat the steps above until the animal performs the sequence automatically.\nLoad the automatic task. The animal gets rewarded automatically when it performs the reach and grasp movements for a predetermined time.\nGradually increase the holding time of the object.\nIntroduce the laser that projects the fixation point at the base of the object. Add then the eye tracker to monitor the eye position around the object-to-be-grasped. \nTrain the animal in Memory-Guided Grasping (MGG) to investigate the motor component of the response, not affected by the visual component of the stimulus.\n\t\t\nRestrain the monkey’s head.\nFollow the same steps described for the VGG making sure that the animal maintains fixation on the laser during the task within an electronically defined window. For this version of the task, the light goes off at the end of the fixation period.\nTrain the monkey in Passive Fixation to address visual responsiveness and shape selectivity. \n\t\t\nRestrain the monkey’s head.\nPresent the visual stimuli to the monkey using either a CRT (Passive fixation of 3D stimuli) or an LCD monitor (Passive Fixation of 2D stimuli).\nPresent a fixation spot at the center of the screen, superimposed on the visual stimuli.\nReward the animal after each presentation of the stimulus and increase gradually the fixation period until reaching the standards of the task.\nPerform Surgery, using sterile tools, drapes and gowns.\n\t\nAnesthetize the animal with ketamine (15 mg/kg, intramuscularly) and medetomidine hydrochloride (0.01-0.04 mL/kg intramuscularly) and confirm the anesthesia regularly by checking the animal’s response to stimuli, heart rate, respiration rate and blood pressure. \nMaintain general anesthesia (propofol 10 mg/kg/h intravenously) and administer oxygen with a tracheal tube. Use a lanolim-based ointment to prevent eye dryness while under anesthesia.",
    "Provide analgesia using 0.5 cc of Buprenorphine (0.3mg/ml intravenously). In case of increase of heart rate during the surgery, an extra dosage can be administered. \nImplant an MRI compatible head post with ceramic screws and dental acrylic. Perform all survival surgeries under strict aseptic conditions. For an adequate maintenance of the sterile field, use disposable sterile gloves, masks and sterile instruments. \nGuided by anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; Horsley-Clark coordinates), make a craniotomy above the area of interest and implant the recording chamber on the monkey’s skull. Use a standard recording chamber for single unit extracellular recordings or a multielectrode microdrive, for the simultaneous recording of multiple neurons.\nAfter the surgery, discontinue the intravenous administration of propofol until spontaneous breathing resumes. Do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained consciousness and introduce the animal in the social group only after complete recovery.\nProvide post-operative analgesia as recommended by the institutional veterinarian; use for example Meloxicam (5mg/ml intramuscularly).\nWait 6 weeks after the surgery before starting the experiment. This allows a better anchorage of the head post to the skull and guarantees that the animal has fully recovered from the intervention.\nLocalize the recording area using MRI (for single unit extracellular recordings) and computed tomography (CT; for multielectrode recordings).\n\t\nFill glass capillaries with a 2% copper sulfate solution and insert them into a recording grid.\nPerform structural MRI (slice thickness: 0.6 mm). \nMonitoring of  neural activity.\n\t\nUse tungsten microelectrodes with an impedance of 0.8 – 1 MΩ.\nInsert the electrode through the dura using a 23G stainless steel guide tube and a hydraulic microdrive. \nFor spike discrimination, amplify and filter the neural activity between 300 and 5,000 Hz. \nFor local field potential (LFP) recordings, amplify and filter the signal between 1 and 170 Hz.\nMonitor the eye signal",
    "Adjust an infrared camera in front of the animal’s eyes to obtain an adequate image of the pupil and of the corneal reflex. \nUse an infrared-based camera to sample the pupil position at 500 Hz.\n2. Investigating Object Selectivity in Dorsal Areas \nPerform Visually-Guided Grasping (VGG).\n\t\nChoose the right grasping setup depending on the goal of research: carousel setup or robot setup (Figure 3). \nFor the carousel setup, run the VGG task:\n\t\t\nLet the monkey place the hand contralateral to the recorded hemisphere in the resting position in complete darkness to initiate the sequence. \nAfter a variable time (intertrial interval: 2,000-3,000 ms), apply a red laser (fixation point) at the base of the object (distance: 28 cm from the monkeys’ eyes). If the animal maintains its gaze inside an electronically-defined fixation window (+/- 2.5°) for 500 ms, illuminate the object from above with a light source. \nAfter a variable delay (300-1500 ms), program a dimming of the laser (visual GO cue) instructing the monkey to lift the hand from the resting position, and reach, grasp and hold the object for a variable interval (holding time: 300-900 ms). \nWhenever the animal performs the whole sequence correctly, reward it with a drop of juice.\nUse a similar task sequence for the robot setup.\n\t\t\nAs for the carousel setup, let the monkey place the hand contralateral to the recorded hemisphere in the resting position in complete darkness to initiate the sequence. \nAfter a variable time (intertrial interval: 2,000-3,000 ms), illuminate the LED (fixation point) on the object (from within; distance: 28 cm from the monkeys’ eyes). Again, if the animal maintains its gaze inside an electronically-defined fixation window (+/- 2.5°) for 500 ms, illuminate the object from within with a white light source.",
    "After a variable delay (300-1500 ms), switch off the LED (visual GO cue), instructing the monkey to lift the hand from the resting position, and reach, grasp and hold the object for a variable interval (holding time: 300-900 ms). \nWhenever the animal performs the whole sequence correctly, reward it with a drop of juice.\nDuring the task, quantify the performance of the monkey, paying special attention to the timing. Measure both the time elapsed between the go-signal and the onset of the hand movement (reaction time), and between the start of the movement and the lift of the object (grasping time).\nPerform Memory-Guided Grasping (MGG; ‘Grasping in the dark’). Use the MGG task to determine if neurons are visuomotor or motor-dominant. \n\t​Note: The sequence is similar to that described for the VGG, but the object is grasped in total darkness.\n\t\nIdentical to the VGG task, let the monkey place the hand contralateral to the recorded hemisphere in the resting position in complete darkness to initiate the sequence. \nAfter a variable time (intertrial interval: 2,000-3,000 ms), apply a red laser/LED (fixation point) to indicate the fixation point (at the base of the object for the carousel setup, at the center of the object for the robot setup; distance: 28 cm from the monkeys’ eyes). If the animal maintains its gaze inside an electronically-defined fixation window (+/- 2.5°) for 500 ms, illuminate the object.\nAfter a fixed time (400 ms), switch off the light. \nAfter a variable delay period (300-1500 ms) following  light offset, dim/switch off the fixation point (GO CUE) to instruct the monkey to lift the hand and reach, grasp, and hold the object (holding time: 300-900 ms). \nWhenever the animal performs the whole sequence correctly, give a drop of juice as a reward.",
    "Perform Passive fixation. As for the VGG task, choose the most appropriate setup (carousel or robot setup) depending on the goal of the research. \n\t​Note: Two different passive fixation tasks can be performed: passive fixation of real-world objects (using the objects-to-be-grasped in the carousel and robot setups) and passive fixation of 3D/2D images of objects.\n\t\nPerform passive fixation of real-world objects. \n\t\t\nPresent the fixation point (red laser for the carousel setup projected at the base of the object and red LED in the robot setup).\nIf the animal maintains its gaze inside an electronically-defined fixation window (+/- 2.5°) for 500 ms, illuminate the object for 2,000 ms. \nIf the animal maintains its gaze within the window for 1,000 ms, reward it with a drop of juice. \nPerform passive fixation of 3D/2D images of objects.\n\t\t\nPresent all visual stimuli on a black background (luminance of 8 cd/m2) using a monitor (resolution of 1,280 × 1,024 pixels) equipped with a fast-decay P46-phosphor and operated at 120 Hz (viewing distance: 86 cm).\nIn the 3D tests, present the stimuli stereoscopically by alternating the left and right eye images on a display (CRT monitor), in combination with two ferroelectric liquid crystal shutters. Locate these shutters in front of the monkey’s eyes, operate at 60 Hz and synchronize to the vertical retrace of the monitor. \nStart the trial by presenting a small square in the center of the screen (fixation point; 0.2° × 0.2°). If the eye position remains within an electronically defined 1° square window (much smaller than for real-world objects) for at least 500 ms, present the visual stimulus on the screen, for a total time of 500 ms. \nWhen the monkey maintains a stable fixation until the stimulus offset, reward it with a drop of juice.",
    "For an adequate study of shape selectivity, run a comprehensive battery of tests with 2D images during passive fixation task, in the following sequence.\nRun a Search test. Test the visual selectivity of the cell using a wide set of images (surface images; Figure 4A), including the pictures of the object that is grasped in the VGG. For this and all subsequent visual tasks, compare the image evoking the strongest response (termed ‘preferred image’) to a second image to which the neuron is responding weakly (termed ‘nonpreferred image’). If the neuron under study responds also to the images of objects, search for specific stimulus components driving the cell’s responsiveness (Contour test, Receptive Field test and Reduction test).\nRun a Contour test. From the original surface images of real objects (2D or 3D images containing texture, shading and perspective), obtain progressively simplified versions of the same stimulus shape (silhouettes and outlines; Figure 4B). Collect at least 10 trials per condition in order to determine whether the neuron prefers the original surface, the silhouette or the outline from the original shape.\nRun a Receptive Field (RF) test. To map the RF of a neuron, present the images of objects at different positions on a display (in this experiment, 35 positions; stimulus size of 3°), covering the central visual field19,20. To collect enough stimulus repetitions at all possible positions in a reasonable time, reduce the stimulus duration (flashed stimuli; stimulus duration: 300 ms, intertrial interval: 300 ms).",
    "Run a Reduction test. Run a Reduction test with contour fragments presented at the center of the RF to identify the Minimum Effective Shape Feature (MESF). Generate the set of stimuli in Photoshop by cropping the contour of each of the original contour shapes along the main axes (Figure 3B). Design the MESF as the smallest shape fragment evoking a response that is at least 70% of the intact outline response and not significantly smaller than that response8. \nFor a better estimation of position dependency (the effect of stimulus position on fragment selectivity), run two different tests. Run a Reduction Test with the fragments located at the position occupied in the original outline shape. Run a Reduction Test with the fragments at the center of mass of the shape. \nAt this stage, run a new RF mapping using the MESF.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
