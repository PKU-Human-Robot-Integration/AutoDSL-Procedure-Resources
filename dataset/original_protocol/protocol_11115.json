    "1. Culturing ES-D3 cells\nTo generate exosome-free fetal bovine serum (FBS), load FBS into an ultracentrifuge and centrifuge at 100,000 x g for 16 h at 4 °C. Following centrifugation, collect serum supernatant as exosome-free FBS for culturing the murine ESC cell line ES-D3 and acquiring exosome-enriched EVs.\nBefore plating the ES-D3 cells, coat 15 cm tissue culture dishes using gelatin (0.1%) at room temperature for 30 min.\nFollowing a previously described protocol16, culture the ES-D3 cells without feeder layer cells in the gelatin-coated 15 cm tissue culture dishes. The ES-D3 cell culture medium is composed of DMEM, exosome-free FBS (15%), nonessential amino acids (0.1 mM), L-glutamine (2 mM), β-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mM), penicillin (50 units/mL), streptomycin (50 µg/mL), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; 100 units/mL). Culture ES-D3 cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator.\nOnce the ES-D3 cells reach around 90% confluency in 15 cm tissue culture dishes, remove the medium by aspiration. Wash the cells using trypsin (5 mL; 0.05%). Add trypsin (5 mL) to the dishes and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Collect the cells from the dishes.\nAdd fresh culture medium (5 mL) to the collected cells to inactivate the trypsin. Centrifuge the cells at 390 x g for 5 min. Resuspend the cells in fresh medium and determine the cell number using a hemocytometer.\nFor passaging cells, plate the ES-D3 cells (5 x 106) in a gelatin-coated (0.1%) 15 cm tissue culture dish with fresh medium (15 mL) and culture for 3 days before subculturing the cells.\nTo collect the cell culture supernatant for isolation of exosome-enriched EVs, plate the ES-D3 cells (1 x 107) in a gelatin-coated (0.1%) 15 cm tissue culture dish with fresh medium (15 mL) for 3 days prior to collecting cell culture supernatant.",
    "2. Generation of GM-CSF expression plasmid\nNOTE: Generate the transfection plasmid pEF1α-mGM-CSF-IRES-hrGFP to overexpress GM-CSF in ES-D3 cells. In this plasmid, expression of murine GM-CSF cDNA along with the marker protein humanized Renilla reniformis GFP (hrGFP) is driven by the human polypeptide chain elongation factor 1α (EF1α) promoter17,18.\nGenerate the vector backbone.\n\t\nDigest the plasmid pEF1α-FD3ER-IRES-hrGFP (20 µg of DNA) using the restriction enzyme EcoRI (100 units) at 37 °C for 2 h to generate two DNA fragments: the vector backbone (6.0 kb) and FD3ER insert (2.5 kb).\nTransfer 50% of digested plasmid DNA (10 µg) into one 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and treat with alkaline phosphatase (20 units) at 37 °C for 1 h. Resolve both untreated and dephosphorylated DNA using agarose gel electrophoresis (2%).\nPurify the vector backbone DNA fragments (6.0 kb) using a DNA gel extraction kit . While the untreated vector backbone will serve as the empty vector (pEF1α-IRES-hrGFP), the dephosphorylated vector backbone will be used to generate GM-CSF-expressing plasmid (pEF1α-mGM-CSF-IRES-hrGFP).\nGenerate the GM-CSF cDNA insert.\n\t\nDigest the plasmid pMSCV-mGM-CSF-IRES-EGFP19 (20 µg) using the restriction enzyme EcoRI (100 units) at 37 °C for 2 h to produce two DNA fragments: the vector backbone (6.5 kb) and the murine GM-CSF cDNA insert (474 bp).\nResolve the digested DNA through agarose gel electrophoresis (2%). Purify the murine GM-CSF cDNA fragment (474 bp) using a DNA gel extraction kit.\nGenerate the expression plasmids.\n\t\nSet up 2 ligation reactions (10 μL total volume) using a DNA ligation kit.\n\t\t\nTo generate the empty vector pEF1α-IRES-hrGFP, ligate the untreated vector backbone from step 2.1.3 (6.0 kb; 500 ng).\nTo generate pEF1α-mGM-CSF-IRES-hrGFP, ligate the following DNA fragments: (1) the dephosphorylated vector backbone from step 2.1.3 (6.0 kb; 500 ng) and (2) the mGM-CSF cDNA fragment generated in step 2.2.2 (474 bp; 200 ng).",
    "Ligate at 25 °C for 5 min. Transform ligated DNA into DH5α competent E. coli cells. Plate the transformed E. coli cells on LB-agar plates containing carbenicillin (50 μg/mL).\nPurify plasmids from single E. coli colonies using a DNA isolation kit. Validate the identities of the plasmids by DNA sequencing.\n3. Generation of ES-D3 cells overexpressing GM-CSF\nNOTE: Transfect the ES-D3 cells with the plasmid pEF1α-mGM-CSF-IRES-hrGFP to overexpress GM-CS.

Culture plated ES-D3 cells at 37 °C for 24 h.\nPrepare two plasmid mixtures in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes: (1) pEF1α-IRES-hrGFP (28 µg, vector control) with pBabe-Neo (4 µg) and (2) pEF1α-mGM-CSF-IRES-hrGFP (28 µg, expressing GM-CSF) with pBabe-Neo (4 µg). Carry out transfection using a transfection kit following the manufacturer's protocol.\nAdd transfection medium (1 mL) and transfection reagent (64 µL) to each tube containing the plasmid mixtures and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd the transfection mixtures to respective 10 cm dishes of ES-D3 cells.

Add trypsin (2 mL) and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Transfer the cells to a 15 mL centrifuge tube and add 2 mL of fresh culture medium to neutralize trypsin. Centrifuge at 390 x g for 5 min.",
    "Resuspend the transfected cells in fresh culture medium (10 mL). Evaluate the fluorescence intensity of GFP in transfected ES-D3 cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), following manufacturer's protocol.\nTransfer the transfected cells into two 10 cm dishes containing fresh culture medium (10 mL).

Co-culturing transfected ES-D3 cells with their untransfected parental counterparts ensures that stably transfected single ES-D3 cells survive and proliferate as a single clone.\nCulture the cells for 48 h, and then add neomycin (0.5 mg/mL) to 96-well plates to eliminate untransfected parental ES-D3 cells.\nContinue culturing the GFP-positive ES-D3 cells in 96-well tissue culture plates with medium containing neomycin (0.5 mg/mL) for 1 week.
