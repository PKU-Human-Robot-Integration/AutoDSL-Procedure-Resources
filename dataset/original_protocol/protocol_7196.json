    "Maintenance of stable TMLC reporter cell linesNote: For all cell culture steps, use sterile filter tips and sterile tubes (see Materials and Reagents). Grow TMLC cells in T75 flasks (or equivalent) with DMEM (4.5 g/L glucose and L-glutamine, without sodium pyruvate) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% amphotericin B. To maintain expression of the luciferase TGF-β reporter cassette, also supplement the media with 1 mg/mL G418.TMLC cells expressing the various components of L-TGF-β1 or GARP are cultured using the following antibiotic selection markers (also see Recipes section):TMLC L-TGF-β1 or TMLC L-TGF-β1(R249A): TMLC basal media with 1 mg/mL G418 and 10 μg/mL puromycin.TMLC L-TGF-β1/GARP or TMLC L-TGF-β1(R249A)/GARP: TMLC basal media with 1mg/mL G418, 10 μg/mL puromycin, and 20 μg/mL blasticidin.When 70–90% confluent, detach TMLC cells using 0.25% trypsin EDTA at 37°C for 2 min. Trypsin should be inactivated using at least an equal volume of basal media.Sub-culture cells at a density of 1:20 twice weekly. Spinning and washing of cells is not necessary for routine cell culture. In preparation for functional assays, 70–90% confluent cells are sub-cultured at 1:5 density for 48 h, in the absence of antibiotic selection.Note: We have noticed a significant reduction in the performance of TMLC cells if allowed to reach confluency. For further information on cell line maintenance and quality control, please refer to the “notes on reproducibility” and “cell line QC sections” in the Notes section. Cryopreserve TMLC cells at a density of 2 × 106 cells/mL in a solution of 90% FBS and 10% DMSO, using standard protocols (At a rate of cooling: 1°C per minute, to -80°C. Transfer cells to liquid nitrogen storage within 1 week).Preparation of Assay platesNote: For transferring all reagents, we recommend using sterile filter pipette tips and sterile tubes (see Materials and Reagents).",
    "Prepare stock solutions of recombinant Human αvβ8 ectodomain and negative controls, including BSA, αvβ3 (which does not activate TGF-β), and anti-LAP at a concentration of 1 μg/mL in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 1 mM Ca2+ and 1 mM Mg2+ (see Recipes section).Note: Anti-LAP binds to L-TGF-β1 and was therefore used to control for both the binding and subsequent cell adhesion affects that αvβ8 may have, in addition to its ability to promote TGF-β activation. Plate solutions onto immulon 4 HBX 96-well plates (50 μL/well is sufficient) as in Figure 1C, and cover the plate with a transparent plate sealer. Incubate on a rocking platform at 37°C for 1 h.Wash cells twice with 300 μL of PBS, and block wells in PBS solution supplemented with 1% BSA, using a multichannel pipette and reagent reservoirs. Incubate the assay plate at room temperature for 1 h.Note: Plates can be stored at 4°C up to 48 h before the assay start date. However, it is recommended to use the plates on the same day, for purposes of reproducibility. Cell line preparation and cell seedingForty eight hours prior to TGF-β activation assays, split 70–90% confluent TMLC lines at 1:5 density. At this stage, culture cells in TMLC basal media only.Note: For continued use of cell lines, also maintain some cells in relevant reselection media. On the day of the assay, detach cells using 0.25% trypsin EDTA as described above.Note: Cells should not be confluent. Inactivate trypsin using an equal volume of TMLC basal media, and transfer cell suspensions to labelled 15 mL Falcon tubes.Pellet cell suspensions by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min. After centrifugation, aspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in TMLC basal media by gentle vortexing for 5 s. Count viable cells using a LUNA cell counter or equivalent.",
    "Prepare standard curves in a serial 3-fold dilution series, starting from 16 ng/mL* rTGF-β1 in basal media using a multi-channel pipette (This can be performed within the assay plate, see Figure 1C). The final volume of standards in the assay plate should be 100 μL.Note: *For clarity, when an equal volume of TMLC cell suspension is subsequently added to each well, this dilutes each standard by 50%, matching the dilution series depicted in Figure 1C. Standard curves are essential to control for differences in TGF-β sensitivity between TMLC cell lines.Dilute TMLC cell suspensions to a concentration of 1.5 × 105 cells/mL in TMLC basal media, and plate 100 μL of cell suspension/well onto immulon 4 HBX 96-well assay plates, using a multi-channel pipette and reagent reservoir (an example of an assay plate format is shown in Figure 1C–D).Note: Whilst TMLC cells do not easily clump, it is recommended to pipette up and down three times before transferring cells from the reagent reservoir to the assay plate. Cover plates with Aeraseal plate covers, and incubate under standard cell culture conditions (37°C, 5% CO2, in a humidified cell culture incubator) for 16–18 h.Note: For assay reproducibility, ensure that incubation times are consistent between experimental replicates. Assay developmentEnsure that luciferase assay lysis buffer, luciferase assay buffer and PBS are equilibrated to room temperature prior to assay development.Prepare cells for lysis by aspiration of media using a multi-channel vacuum manifold. Immediately wash cells twice with 300 μL of PBS, using a multi-channel pipette and reagent reservoir. It is not necessary to maintain aseptic technique from this point.Note: TMLC cells adhere strongly to culture plastic, and all aspiration steps can be performed with a vacuum manifold for efficiency.",
    "Lyse cells in 100 μL of luciferase assay lysis buffer, and incubate on a rocking platform at room temperature for 30 min.Note: To reduce intra-plate variability, it is not recommended to scrape the wells manually. Transfer 80 μL of lysate from each well of the immulon 4 HBX plate into a 96-well cell culture white plate (Costar 3917), using a multi-channel pipette.Record luciferase activity using a Glomax Explorer (Promega), with the following settings:Injection volume of luciferase assay buffer (100 μL), wait 2 s, integrations (10) interval (0.3 s).Data analysis and expected resultsSubtract the raw relative light unit (rLU) data recorded in the BSA control wells from all other rLU values. This allows for removal of the background signal for each cell line.Note: Subtracting the BSA control data for each cell line is important due to variance in background readings between cell lines. Transform background subtracted rLU data to represent nanograms per mililiter of active TGF-β, by interpolating from the standard curves of known TGF-β treatments (Figure 2B).Note: This allows for more accurate comparison of the amount of TGF-β signaling between different TMLC lines, as it also controls for observed differences in TGF-β sensitivity. Present the data using GraphPad prism 7 or above, as depicted in Figure 2D.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4385/bioprotoc-12-08-4385-g001.jpgFigure 1. Assay design to assess the ability of recombinant αvβ8 ectodomain for promoting cell intrinsic TGF-β signaling, from both releasable and non-releasable forms of L-TGF-β1. A. Cartoon depiction of TMLC TGF-β reporting cells. TMLC are a stable clone of mink epithelial cells overexpressing the PAI-1 promoter sequence fused to a luciferase reporter cassette (Abe et al., 1994). TMLC cells express high levels of TGF-βRs which are able to initiate TGF-β signaling on binding to mature TGF-β.",
    "Downstream of TGF-β signaling, pSMAD drives the expression of luciferase, and TGF-β signaling can be reported following cell lysis and assessment of luciferase activity using luciferase assay buffer (containing D-luciferin substrate). To build a cell intrinsic TGF-β signaling model, we overexpressed the adaptor molecule GARP and/or L-TGF-β1, or the non-releasable form (R249A). B. Cartoon depiction of TMLC L-TGF-β1/GARP cells in culture with immobilized αvβ8 ectodomain. In this case, the TMLC L-TGF-β1/GARP cells (or controls) were plated onto immobilized integrin ectodomain (or control substrates), and the subsequent luciferase activity of the cells measured. C. Assay format to assess whether αvβ8 can support cell intrinsic TGF-β activation. Negative controls, including BSA protein (green), αvβ3 ectodomain (red), and anti-LAP (yellow), were immobilized alongside αvβ8 ectodomain (purple), as described in the assay procedure section. TMLC WT, TMLC GARP alone, and TMLC L-TGF-β1 alone control cells were then plated onto the various substrates in triplicate, so that they could be compared to the signal generated in the TMLC L-TGF-β1/GARP test cells. D. Assay format to assess the ability of αvβ8 to promote cell intrinsic TGF-β signaling of non-releasable TGF-β. Here, the assay was modified to include controls of TMLC L-TGF-β1 alone, TMLC L-TGF-β1(R249A) alone, and TMLC L-TGF-β1/GARP, so that they could be compared to the signal generated in TMLC L-TGF-β1(R249A)/GARP cells. In all cases, a unique standard curve of each cell type treated with known concentrations of recombinant human TGF-β1 (in 3-fold serial dilution, from 8 ng/mL) was used, so that TGF-β responsiveness could be normalized between cell lines, and data could be presented as concentration (ng/mL) of TGF-β1 signaling (Abe et al., 1994; Campbell et al., 2020).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4385/bioprotoc-12-08-4385-g002.jpgFigure 2. An exemple of raw data and data analysis workflow from an assay plate prepared identically to Figure 1D. A.",
    "Relative light units (rLU) readings following assay development. Data is presented in heat map format (high rLU values in red low values in blue). B. A standard curve of known rTGF-β1 concentrations were prepared for all four TMLC lines used in this assay, allowing for quantitative analysis of TGF-β signaling and for normalization of TGF-β sensitivity between cell lines. C. Data from A is presented in graphical format, after subtracting the BSA control wells from each sample. D. BSA background subtracted rLU data was then converted to ng/mL of TGF-β signaling for each cell line, by interpolating from individual standard curves as shown in (B). Data sets with more than one technical replicate are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD)."
