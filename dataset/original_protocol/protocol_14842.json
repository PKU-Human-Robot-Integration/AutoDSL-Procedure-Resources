    "NOTE: The experiments using mice were performed in accordance to the institutional animal welfare committee (IACUC) guidelines.\n1. Reconstituting the Rag-1-/- Mice with In Vitro Cultured Th17 cells (Three days prior to Infection)\nFor establishing Th17 cells, culture CD4+ CD44low CD62Lhigh CD25- naïve T cells (3 x 104) in U-bottom 96 well plates alone, or co-culture them along with 3 x 104 CD4+CD25+Foxp3+Tregs in the presence of soluble  α-CD3 (1 µg/ml), α-CD28 (2 µg/ml) antibodies and antigen presenting cells, under Th17 conditions (polarized using IL-6 (25 ng/ml), TGF- β (2 ng/ml),  α-IFN-γ (2 µg/ml) and α -IL-4 (2 µg/ml)) for three to four days. \n\tNOTE: Naïve cells and Tregs were sorted using fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) and magnetic cell isolation procedures and cultured as described previously19-22.\nOn day 4, after resuspending the Th17 cells using the pipette, collect them from cultures, and centrifuge them under sterile conditions.\n\t\nTake a small aliquot of these cells to examine their viability and for phenotyping. Resuspend them in 500 µl of RPMI medium, add propidium iodide (200 ng/ml) and assess their viability immediately by flow cytometry. Perform phenotyping by flow cytometry assessment of IL-17A production after restimulation (see section 6.3).\nCentrifuge and wash the main bulk of the cells in sterile PBS at 480 x g for 6 min at 4° C in all the steps unless otherwise specified.\nUse these cells for adoptive transfer into 6-8 week old CD45.2 Rag1-/- immunodeficient mice.\n\t\nResuspend the cells at 1 x 107 cells/ml cell density using cold sterile PBS.",
    "Inject 100 μl of the cells by intraperitoneal injection, using 25 G needles on 1 ml tuberculin syringes, such that one mouse receives 1 x 106 cells. Some mice will receive PBS or Th17 cells only, and other mice will receive Th17 cells that were co-cultured with Treg cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform all the steps aseptically.\n2. Growing C. albicans for infection (one day prior to Infection)\nBefore inoculation, disperse five colonies of the CAF2-1 C. albicans laboratory strain in 100 µl of sterile PBS suspension, and add the suspension to the sterile broth.\nInoculate 5 colonies of the C. albicans in 50 ml of the Yeast nitrogen base (YNB without amino acids)/Peptone/Dextrose broth medium and incubate in a shaker incubator at 30 °C for 15–18 hr at 130 rpm.\nMonitor the broth for cloudiness, as that is an indication for the growth of the fungus.\n3. Candida Harvesting and Counting Procedure (On the Day of Infection)\nCollect 10 ml of Candida broth in 15 ml tubes. For larger volumes, collect Candida in 50 ml tubes.\nCentrifuge the blastospores at 1900 x g for 5 min at RT in all the steps unless otherwise specified. Pellet the blastospores by centrifugation, followed by the removal of the supernatant.\nIf there is more than one tube, pool the Candida blastospores from multiple tubes, adding sterile PBS to the pellets and resuspend them in 10 ml of PBS for counting.\nTake 20 μl of blastospores in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes, add 20 μl of the 2X paraformaldehyde and incubate at RT for 15-20 min. Count the fixed blastospores using the hemocytometer under the microscope.\n\tNOTE: Paraformaldehyde is carcinogenic. Open the undiluted solution only in the fume hood.",
    "In the meantime, repeat washing the blastospores at least twice, by centrifuging them in PBS, and pelleting the blastospores . Keep the pellets in 15 ml tubes at RT, in the ABSL1 hood, ready for infection.\nLeave some sterile PBS at RT for resuspending the blastospores for infection.\nAfter counting, add sterile PBS to the blastospore pellet to adjust the yeast blastospore cell numbers to 2 x108 of yeast cells/ml. This is the blastospore suspension that will be used to infect the mice.\n\tNOTE: Perform all the steps aseptically.\n4. Mice Infection (3-5 Days after Cell Transfer)\nNOTE: The basic infection procedure is performed as described previously19,23-25.\nWeigh the Rag-1-/- mice that received PBS or the cells three days earlier.\nCalculate the dose of anesthetic agents using their body weight. Anesthetize the mice by administering ketamine/xylazine mixture (16.1 mg/ml and 1.6 mg/ml), using 25 G needles on 1 ml tuberculin syringes, by intraperitoneal injection.\n\t\nAdminister 50 µl per 10 grams of body weight. (i.e., 0.8 mg of ketamine and 0.08 mg of xylazine/10 g of body weight or 80 mg of ketamine and 8 mg of xylazine per kg of body weight respectively). Observe for toe pinch response every 15 min after anesthesia.\n\t\tNOTE: This dosage will induce 60-90 min of anesthesia, which is enough for the infection procedure.\nApply the ophthalmic lubricant ointment in the eyes of the mice to prevent the corneas from drying out. As the eye lubricant may dry out, repeat ophthalmic lubrication every 45 min.\nInject 1 ml of saline (0.9% NaCl) subcutaneously on the back adjacent to the forelimb, to help rehydration of the mice during anesthesia.",
    "Obtain a new, clean cage. Follow the infection procedure one mouse at a time, placing each mouse into the new cage once infected. Perform the PBS/sham infection first,and then proceed to the Candida infection groups.\nPick up the anesthetized mouse and open the mouth wide to reveal the base of the tongue.\n\t\nPlace a 3 mm diameter cotton ball saturated with 50 µl of PBS or blastospore suspension, sublingually in the oral cavity for 90 min. Flip the mice every 15 min front and back to prevent lung congestion, ensuring that the cotton balls don't move.\nSet up a timer for every mouse to ensure 90 min of Sham or Candida inoculation in the oral cavity.\nKeep them in a cage under the heat lamp (4 feet away), and each mouse on heat gel pads.\nMake sure that the tongue is withdrawn inside and away from the teeth, to avoid teeth lacerating the tongue.\nAt the end of 90 min, remove the cotton ball from the mouth of the mouse. Watch for any mouse that may recover from anesthesia sooner than 75 minutes. In such a case, anesthetize them again with ketamine (40 mg/kg) only.\n5. Post Procedure Monitoring (during the 90 min Anesthesia)\nUse heat gel pads during the 90 min anesthesia.\n\t\nTo maintain the body temperature and to prevent suffocation, do not allow mice to recover on the regular corn-cob mouse bedding.\nAfter the recovery from anesthesia, administer an additional 1 ml of sterile 0.9% NaCl subcutaneously in two locations on the back.\nKeep up to five PBS (sham) inoculated mice per cage. House only 1-2 infected mice per cage.\nFill out the procedure card with initials every day after the procedure to note down the changes in the body weight, grooming habits and overall health.",
    "6. Assessing the Inflammation\n6.1) Weight loss\nWeigh the mice every day during the infection, starting on the day prior to infection procedure.\n\tNOTE: Typically, the immunodeficient mice injected with Th17 cells and with no Tregs succumb to 20-30% weight loss due to increased fungal burden19 and exacerbated inflammation.\n6.2) Histology scoring of the tongue\nSacrifice the mice by CO2 asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation.\nOpen the jaws and dissect out the tongue with scissors and forceps. Use blunt forceps to hold the tongue, and using the scissors reach out to the back of the mouth to incise the back end of the tongue.\nFor immunocytochemical hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of the tongue tissues, rinse the tongue tissues with ice cold PBS. Add 5 ml of 10% formalin for 2-3 tongues and fix them O/N in 15 ml tubes.\n\t\nThe next day, remove the formalin and immerse the tissues in 5 ml of 70% ethanol to prevent hyper-fixation. Send them out to commercial service to continue with paraffin embedding, sectioning and staining of paraffin sections.\n\t\tNOTE: Commercial histology service is used to perform these steps.\nOnce the slides are back from the commercial histology service, grade the inflammation by observing the tissue sections under a light microscope.\n\t\nScore from 0 to 5, with 0 being no inflammation, and 5 being the most severe inflammation. Score the inflammation using Table 1.\n6.3) Cytokine production by Th17 cells\nNOTE: Excessive TNF-α production is one of the readouts for excessive immunopathology. When mice are adoptively transferred with Th17 cells only, it causes immunopathology that is associated with excessive TNF-α production in Th17 cells.\nCollect a single cell suspension from spleen, cervical lymph nodes, axillary lymphnodes, and tongue, using previously described methods19,26.",
    "Restimulate the cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (50 ng/ml) and Ionomycin (500 ng/ml) for 4 hr with Brefeldin A (10 µg/ml) added in the last 2 hr. Wash the cells with PBS and fix them using a commercial Fixation/permeabilization kit according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nPerform intra cellular cytokine staining using the fluorochrome conjugated anti-TNF-α, anti-IL-17A and ROR-γt antibodies as described previously19.\nBriefly, resuspend the cells in the 1X permeabilization buffer with the cocktail of anti-TNF-α, anti-IL-17A and ROR-γt antibodies, each antibody at 2 - 3 µg/ml final concentration.\nIncubate the cells for 1 hr at RT.\nAfter the incubation, wash the cells with 1X permeabilization buffer.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 500 µl of PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin for flow cytometry analysis.\nSubscription Required.
