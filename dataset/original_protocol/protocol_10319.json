    "1. Target Fabrication\nSandblasting\n\t\nPrepare a 316 stainless steel sheet with a 1.2-mm thickness. Using a pencil or a nail, draw a 40 mm x 40 mm square onto the sheet with the aid of a ruler.\nCut the drawn square using a manual metal cutter. CAUTION! Watch the fingers.\nUse a file to round the corners and sides of the sample. CAUTION! They are very sharp; be careful.\nPrepare a straight wooden or metal block slightly larger in size than the stainless steel sheet. Place the cut sheet on it; do this in order to avoid bending the sample during sandblasting.\nPlace the assembly in the internal blast chamber. Remember to use a dust collector and to tightly seal the internal blast chamber; otherwise, the sand will spread all over during the process. Wear safety goggles to protect the eyes.\nPosition a blast gun perpendicular to and at least 4-5 cm away from the metal surface. Apply the foot control for sandblasting. Put the sample on the piece of wood (1-2 cm thick) using a vice, as the high-pressure sand flow can deform the sample. During sand-blasting, hold the sample tightly by the edge of the piece of wood or by using another vice.\nRepeat the sandblasting on the other side if it is desirable to have a calibration pattern engraved on both sides.\nLaser patterning\n\t\nDesign a pattern of asymmetric circles, as shown in Figure 1.\nPrepare a drawing exchange format (DXF) file of the design either using CAD software or another suitable programming language.\n\t\tNOTE: For convenience, a Python application that can generate DXF files for the design mentioned in this paper is provided as part of the compact GUI application16.\nImport the DXF files into the laser cutting software.",
    "Set up the following parameters for background etching. Laser Power: 40%, Scan Speed: 80 cm/s, Frequency: 4,000 Hz, Number of Passes: 1.\nSet up the following parameters for etching the pattern. Laser Power: 40%, Scan Speed: 2.1 cm/s, Frequency: 4,000 Hz, Number of Passes: 1.\nPut the sample on the working platform and align the cutting pattern using the software.\nAfter the laser performs the cut, clean the sample by dipping it in alcohol. Do not use any wipes, as they usually leave undesirable residue.\nSterilization\n\t\nWrap the sterilized sample in a sterilization package and insert it in the sterilization unit (autoclave).\nAdd water (not distilled water) to the autoclave and follow the user's guide/manufacturer's recommendations to sterilize the target.\n2. Peri-operative Calibration\nCalibration software\n\t\nInstall the \"endocal\" endoscope calibration software package provided on GitHub16 (follow the instructions in the README file therein).\n\t\tNOTE: This software wraps the OpenCV camera calibration module17 in an easy-to-use convenience application. The provided application runs in two modes: online and offline. The online mode acquires the video stream directly from compatible frame-grabber hardware. The offline mode allows for loading endoscope images either from a video file or a folder with a number of video frames saved as image files. See README for supported hardware and detailed instructions on how to use these two modes.\nEndoscopic video acquisition\n\tNOTE: The following instructions are for online calibration (as described above), but they are also applicable to offline calibration.\n\t\nPlace the calibration target in a sterile fluid container, such as a gallipot.\nFill the container with the target fluid or a similar sterile substance.",
    "NOTE: For instance, in fetoscopic procedures, the target fluid is amniotic fluid. Since the optical properties of amniotic fluid are similar to saline water18,19, sterile saline water can be used for calibrating the fetoscope.\nAdjust the zoom and sharpness of the endoscope as desired.\nImmerse the endoscope in the fluid and hold it at a distance from the calibration target similar to the distance from the anatomy that the endoscope will later be used at.\nLaunch the calibration application and start the camera acquisition.\nMove the tip of the endoscope slightly for different views while keeping the whole calibration pattern in view of the camera. For optimal performance, keep the elliptical legend around the calibration pattern within the circular view of the endoscope.\n\t\tNOTE: Video frames that are usable for calibration are indicated by a virtual pattern overlay, as seen in Figure 3.\nAcquire at least the minimum number of endoscopic camera views required for calibration (as indicated in the endocal window).\n\t\tNOTE: The current version of endocal requires at least 10 endoscopic camera views for calibration, a heuristically selected number of views where the calibration error appears to be minimal and follow a stable pattern20.\nPress the calibration key, as indicated on the endocal window, to start the calibration process using the images acquired so far.\nSaving and using the calibration parameters\n\t\nPress the indicated calibration key to save the resulting calibration parameters in a YAML (\"YAML Ain't Markup Language\") file21.\nGroup the calibration parameters into the camera matrix and distortion coefficients, as explained in the OpenCV camera calibration module17.\n\t\tNOTE: After performing the calibration, the calibration application automatically displays the distortion-corrected image to the right of the original endoscope image.\nUse the distortion-corrected video feed during a fetoscopic procedure for pure visualization or for real-time placental mosaicing11."
