    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMouse breeding and embryonic gestation\nTiming: 2–3 weeks (for E14.5 pregnancies)\nThis part of the protocol includes all the necessary steps to breed the females, check the vaginal plug and establish timed pregnancies.\nStart the breeding process by placing 1 or 2 fertile females in a cage with a single male of the appropriate genotype (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Consider that different mouse lines have different reproductive efficiencies. To maximize the breeding process outcome, we recommend adhering to the following guidelines, especially in difficult-to-breed strains:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1206-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Mouse breeding and plug check\n(A) Schematic of breeding strategy.\n(B) Representative image showing normal aspect of C57B6/N female genitalia.\n(C) View of C57B6/N female genitalia with a positive vaginal mating plug (black arrowhead on inset).\nUse females that have been pregnant before and efficiently delivered a litter.\nChoose animals between 2 and 5 months old. Using too young (below 6 weeks old) or too old (above 30 weeks old) animals might reduce breeding efficiency.\nAlways introduce the females in the cage containing the male that should have been individualized at least 2 days in advance if coming from a stock cage.\nAvoid adding more than 2 females per male at the same time.\nEvery day in the morning (the earlier the better) check the presence of a vaginal plug in the females.\nLocate the female on a flat surface with the head pointing forward.\nLift the back part of the animal by the tail, exposing the vagina (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nCarefully, introduce a p200 sterile pipet tip 1–3 mm inside the vagina to check the presence of a vaginal plug (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). The tip can be also used to gently expose slightly the vaginal opening to visualize the plug inside.",
    "Note: Different mouse strains produce different types of plugs in terms of size, location and duration. The plug could fall down before the time it is checked. For that reason, we recommend exploring the females early in the morning.\nWhen the plug is observed, the female will be considered positive, the date recorded and established as embryonic day E0.5. It is recommended to separate the female into a new cage without the male. If no plug is observed, the female should remain in the male cage until a positive plug is observed.\nCritical: If a female is negative for more than 7–10 consecutive days, it is recommended to separate the animals and use a different female for the plug breeding. However, the original female should be monitored for pregnancy since there is a possibility of getting false negatives (i.e. in case the plug is lost before plug check). We do not recommend using false negative females for echocardiographic analysis as the exact day of pregnancy might not be accurate. Instead, these pregnant females could be used to refresh the mouse colony.\nSince a positive plug does not mean pregnancy, the positive females should be monitored for effective pregnancy. Several methods can be used depending on the stage of pregnancy:\nFor early stage pregnancy, monitoring the weight of the female might be helpful. The values could vary depending on the genetic background, e.g., C57BL6/N vs CD1. Generally, for B6N backgrounds an increase in body weight of 1.5g from day E0.5 to E8.5 is usually indicative of pregnancy.",
    "For later stage pregnancies, closer to the echocardiography day (E12.5, E14.5 and so on), observe enlargement and roundness of the female’s lower belly, indicative of pregnancy. Alternatively, hold the female exposing the abdomen and feel the developing embryos. However, this last option should be performed gently and only by experienced personnel, since excessive pressure could damage the embryos and/or cause abortions.\nAnimal preparation and anesthesia\nTiming: 5 min\nThis step describes the anesthesia set up for the pregnant female and spatial disposition at the echocardiography stage. It also covers how to position the female for trans-abdominal echocardiography (detailed in next section) and the necessary steps to expose the embryos for trans-uterine echocardiography.\nTurn on the anesthetic gas scavenging system.\nTurn on the isoflurane anesthesia system.\nMake sure the anesthesia flow is directed to the induction chamber.\nTurn on the oxygen flow meter and establish an oxygen flow of 0.4–0.6 mL (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1206-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Fetal echocardiography by trans-uterine ultrasound\n(A) Oxygen flow meter showing appropriate opening direction (white arrow) to administer oxygen to the anesthetic circuit up to around 0.4–0.6 mL (white square), the usual oxygen range used in mice.\n(B) Isoflurane vaporizer in closed position (OFF) and white flow indicating head′s vaporizer opening direction to dispense anesthesia.\n(C) Pregnant female placed in the warmed platform (white arrowhead), showing mouse head inside the anesthetic nose adapter (black arrowhead) and the paws attached to the electrode pads (ECG pads, white lines).\n(D) The skin of the caudal part of the abdomen is grasped and lifted to pull it upwards to open the abdominal cavity. A small incision is performed to localize the embryo closer to the ribs on the left lateral side (left uterine horn).\n(E) Embryo outside the abdomen inside the uterus.",
    "(F) Individual embryo inside the uterus but outside the abdomen covered with warmed gel and with the echography transductor on top ready to begin a direct trans-uterine ultrasound.\nSet the isoflurane vaporizer to a 2.0%–2.5% for anesthesia induction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPlace the female in the induction chamber and wait until movement stops. This step usually takes between 2 to 3 min.\nTransfer the anesthetized female to the mice heating platform that has been prewarmed at 38.6°C and switch the anesthesia flow to the nose adapter located in the platform (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPlace the female in supine position and gently introduce the nose into the nose adapter.\nUsing tape, gently attach the rear and front paws of the animal to the electrodes pads and add a small volume of water underneath to improve the ECG signal.\nAdjust the isoflurane dose (usually it varies between 1.5%–2.5%) to avoid spontaneous movements but maintaining pedal reflex (light anesthesia plane). This ensures to scan the hearts maintaining physiological conditions as much as possible.\nAdjust the heating platform to maintain the mouse temperature in normothermia (36.8°C–38°C).\nFor trans-uterine echocardiography embryos should be exposed by opening the abdominal cavity of the pregnant female to expose the uterus.\nFor trans-abdominal echocardiography, which allows non-invasive analysis and prevents potential cardiac function alterations associated with temperature drop in ex vivo analysis, proceed from step 4 to next section (See problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]). Troubleshooting 1 Troubleshooting 2\nCritical: For this surgical approach anesthesia must be increased to avoid pedal reflex, which ensures a deep anesthesia plane. Always check full absence of the pedal reflex or the blinking reflex in the pregnant female to make sure anesthesia is complete and effective.\nIncrease isoflurane dose to avoid pedal reflex (usually around 2.5%–3.0%)\nGently sterilize the abdomen of the pregnant female with 70% ethanol.",
    "Using fine forceps, grasp the skin on the lower central part of the abdomen and lift it pulling upwards (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nUsing sterile surgical scissors positioned parallel to the plane of the animal, localize the embryo closer to the ribs on the left lateral side and make a small incision to create a hole in the skin (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nKeep pulling slowly with the forceps, introduce the tip of the scissors and make a cut on the top left lateral side of the abdomen until the embryo pops up (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nImmediately cover the exposed embryo with warmed gel to protect body temperature (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F) and proceed to echocardiography acquisition as detailed in next section.\nNote: When using the scissors, always locate the tip facing upward to avoid damaging any abdominal structure or the embryos inside the uterus. Note: The embryo should remain inside the uterus during the acquisition to minimize alterations on cardiac function and further drop of body temperature.\nEchocardiography acquisition\nTiming: 5 min per embryo\nHere we describe how to perform a systematic embryo identification and imaging acquisition in order to minimize imprecisions and mistakes when associating trans-abdominal echocardiography analysis with the postmortem embryos collected for further histological characterization. In addition, we describe the direct ex vivo method of trans-uterine echocardiography of embryonic hearts.\nFor trans-abdominal echocardiography begin the ultrasound analyzing the embryos located at the left uterine horn scanning them from caudal to cranial. Afterwards, proceed with embryos of the right uterine horn (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1206-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Fetal echocardiography by trans-abdominal ultrasound\n(A) Pregnant female placed in the warmed platform with a scheme of the urinary bladder (UB) location at the point of uterine bifurcation, left and right uterine horns (LH, RH) and embryos from E1-E4 in each side.",
    "(B) Pregnant female abdomen covered with abundant warmed gel and the transductor positioned to visualize the embryos of the left uterine horn.\n(C) Representative echocardiography view of an embryo in cranio-caudal position, showing the head (recognized by visualization of the eye) and the heart with both ventricles (white square).\nCritical: Always begin the study from the embryo located closer to the female urinary bladder in each uterine horn to have a fixed reference that allows you to match a given set of acquired images with a certain embryo. The urinary bladder is easy to detect by ultrasound and is adjacent to the uterine bifurcation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nCover the shaved abdominal region of the pregnant female with abundant warmed ultrasound gel.\nApproximate the probe to the gel and verify a clear echocardiographic view (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nSearch for the tail of the embryo of interest and slowly move towards the head until you find the beating heart (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nFor trans-uterine echocardiography after performing an abdominal section, begin exposing the embryo located closer to the left ovary and more distal from the uterus bifurcation below the pregnant female left ribs. Next, proceed with the consecutive embryos until you reach the bifurcation and start over from the right ovary with embryos located in the right uterus horn.\nPlace the exposed embryo inside the uterus in supine position and cover the thorax with abundant warmed ultrasound gel.\nVerify that no bubbles form in the gel as they might cause imaging artefacts.\nApproximate the probe to the gel and verify a clear cardiac echocardiographic view.",
    "Note: The strategy for embryo acquisition in trans-abdominal and trans-uterine analysis is different. Trans-uterine acquisition requires the exposure of the embryos and has a higher risk of body temperature drop after abdominal opening of the pregnant female. For that reason, when performing trans-uterine ultrasound, acquisition begins with the embryo located more distal of the uterine bifurcation, closer to the female ribs. In this way, the exposure of embryos out of the abdominal cavity is reduced, as the operator can gently place them back after each embryo acquisition and proceed from the ovary to the uterine bifurcation.\nOnce the heart of a given embryo is identified with the ultrasound probe in either trans-abdominal or trans-uterine procedures, continue with a common protocol for functional and structural data acquisition (Liu et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Zhou et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nPlace the probe longitudinally from head to tail to identify the heart (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Angled to optimize a long axis view (equivalent to a longitudinal 4-chamber section of the heart). Once the heart is visualized and centered in the screen, both ventricles and the interventricular septum could be easily observed (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1206-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Basic echocardiographic analysis in a long axis view using the 2D mode\n(A) Heart echocardiography view when the probe is positioned longitudinal to the embryo.\n(B) Optimized long axis view of the heart visualizing the four chambers and the interventricular septum (IVS) by slight angulation of previous longitudinal position.\n(C) Color Doppler echocardiography through the atrioventricular valves. Red color indicates flow towards the upper part of the screen and blue towards the lower part. Black arrows indicate the direction of the blood flow (from the atria into the ventricles).",
    "(D) Pulse wave Doppler obtained positioning the sample in a semilunar valve and showing a regular rhythm (upper image) and an arrhythmia (lower image). In this image, the heart rate can be obtained positioning the heart rate ultrasound caliper in three consecutives waves (white lines).\n(E) Color Doppler echocardiography view placing the area of interest in the IVS to confirm its integrity and lack of communication between ventricular chambers in a normal embryo. Black arrows indicate the direction of the blood flow (from the ventricles to the big vessels, (Aorta and Pulmonary artery)).\n(F) Color Doppler echocardiography view placing the area of interest in the IVS to identify pathological septal defects in an abnormal embryo with ventricular communication (VSD, white arrowhead). A flow (blue area) crossing the IVS can be identified. Red color indicates flow towards the upper part of the screen and blue towards the lower part. A, atria; V, ventricle; IVS, interventricular septum; VSD, ventricular septal defect.\nIn this view, use the bidimensional mode (2D mode) to subjectively assess cardiac function and morphology.\nApply color Doppler (CD) to identify the flow through the atrioventricular and semilunar valves in this plane (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nTo evaluate heart rate, valvular function, and the presence of arrhythmias, utilize Pulsed Wave Doppler (PWD, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nIn addition, CD mode is used to detect abnormal flows through wall septum defects. The Doppler window is placed in the area of interest to highlight normal (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E) or pathological (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F) flows, as in the case of ventricular septal defects (VSD).",
    "Incline the probe to a frontal plane as needed (usually around 90 degrees) to obtain a short axis view (equivalent to a transversal 2-chamber section of the ventricles) for motion-mode acquisition (M-mode). Rotate the probe clockwise to improve the 2-chamber view if necessary. The line used to choose the ultrasound area for M-mode construction must divide both ventricles symmetrically (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1206-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Basic echocardiographic parameters in a short axis view using the M-mode\n(A) Short axis view of the heart visualized when the probe is positioned in a frontal plane to the embryo, and the M-mode line (yellow line) crossing the middle of the ventricles.\n(B) Representative M-mode image of a short axis view showing the measures required to perform structural and functional assessment of the heart. V, ventricle; RVPW, right ventricular wall thickness; IVS; interventricular septum and LVPW, left ventricular wall thickness (in diastole); RVIDd, right ventricular internal diameter; LVIDd, left ventricular internal diameter (d, in diastole); RVIDs; right ventricular internal diameter; LVIDs, left ventricular internal diameter (s, in systole). The yellow lines shown in the right follow the endocardium and the epicardium′s motion as a reference to trace the detailed measures.\nEchocardiography analysis\nTiming: 5 min\nIn this step we describe how to perform a blind analysis off-line using the Vevo Workstation (Visualsonics, Toronto).\nPerform structural analysis of both ventricles using de M-mode acquisition to calculate internal chamber dimensions at the end of the diastole (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nThe internal diameter of left (LVID) and right (RVID) ventricles are measured from endocardium to endocardium, from the ventricular free wall to the septum at the end of the diastole (d) and systole (s)",
    "The left and right ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW, RVPW, respectively) and interventricular septum (IVS) can be measured at the end of the diastole from endocardium to epicardium.\nNote: increased inner diameters could be associated with ventricular chamber dilation and generally correlates with poor cardiac contraction capacity. Increased thickness of LVPW, RVPW or IVS could be related with hypertrophic phenotypes, while thinning of these walls might reflect deficient proliferation or growth arrest and is also present when ventricles are dilated.\nDetermine cardiac function using M-mode images to obtain fractional shortening (FS), which represents the percentage of size reduction of the ventricle during each contraction or systole (s); and ejection fraction (EF), which represents the percentage of blood that is pumped in each systole in relation to the total volume of blood in the ventricle in diastole (d). The FS and EF are automatically calculated by the ultrasound software using the diastolic and systolic ventricular internal diameter measured (Wu et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nLVFS (%) is calculated as: [(LVIDd-LVIDs)/LVIDd] × 100. LVEF (%) is calculated as: [(LV Vold – LV Vols) / LV Vold] × 100. Volume is calculated as: [7/ (2.4 + LVIDd)] × (LVIDd)3\nNote: same calculations can be applied for the RV.\nNote: contractility can be also assess subjectively identifying oscillatory peaks in the M-mode reflecting effective diastole (higher peaks) and systole (lower peaks) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B)\nNote: congenital cardiac defects associated with pathological chamber communication are subjectively assessed with the CD images in both atrial and ventricular septum as detailed in further sections (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nEmbryo dissection and histological validation\nTiming: 1 week\nThis part of the protocol describes how to dissect the embryos after echocardiography and its processing for histological analysis and morphological validation of echocardiographic assessment.\nEmbryo dissection:",
    "In order to collect the embryos, the pregnant females should undergo euthanasia:\nOnce the last embryo has been acquired and before switching the anesthesia system off, sacrifice the female by bilateral pneumothorax.\nTo this aim, perform an incision with the scissors into the second intercostal space, open the chest cavity and break the diaphragm. This procedure will make the lungs collapse.\nWait 2–5 min before switching the anesthesia off and remove the female from the platform.\nExcise the uterus in one piece. To keep the embryos matched with the echocardiography acquisition, it is recommended to keep the ovary in the right side of the uterus (last imaged embryo) and remove the ovary in the left end (first imaged embryo).\nPlace the uterus in a Petri dish filled with ice-cold PBS (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1206-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Midterm embryo collection, dissection and preparation of thoracic region for paraffin inclusion\n(A) View of the whole uterus containing embryos at E14.5 in cold-PBS over a Petri dish.\n(B) Excision of the first decidua located in the more distal position relative to the uterus bifurcation on the left horn of the uterus.\n(C) Isolated decidua at E14.5, containing the embryo and the placenta.\n(D) View of an E14.5 embryo, still connected to the placenta through the umbilical cord.\n(E) Fragmented E14.5 embryo to isolate the trunk, allowing a better fixation of the thoracic region (white arrowhead).\n(F) Trunks containing the heart are incubated in P12 wells filled with ice-cold- 4% PFA for fixation.\nCut out the first decidua containing embryo #1 (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B) and transfer it to a clean Petri dish with ice-cold PBS (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nUsing sterile fine forceps, under the binocular scope remove all the extraembryonic tissues and the yolk sac (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D).",
    "Save the yolk sac in a 1.5 mL tube labeled with the embryo code for genotyping purposes.\nFor E14.5 or older embryos, it is recommended to only fix the thoracic region, to improve fixative penetration (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E).\nRemove the head by cutting at the neck level.\nIn the abdomen region locate a dark-brown area, the liver, and cut out the inferior part of the embryo at this level.\nIn the remaining piece of the thorax, remove the abdominal organs and upper limbs and carefully open the diaphragm membrane with fine forceps without disturbing the heart or lungs.\nTransfer the thorax of the embryo to a p12 well labeled with the embryo code and filled with 2 mL of 1M KCl solution. Incubate for 5 min. This treatment will relax the cardiac chambers to be in diastole (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]F).\nWith a plastic pipette, remove the KCl solution and add 2 mL of 4% ice-cold PFA. Keep the plate on ice until all the embryos have been harvested.\nFollow steps d. to i. with each of the remaining embryos matching the E number code between genotyping tubes and embryo collecting plates.\nFix the embryos for 12–16 h at 4°C with gentle shaking.\nGenotyping:\nPerform your preferred DNA extraction and genotyping protocol using the yolk sac saved in a 1.5 mL tube during each embryo dissection.\nHistological processing: Once fixed, cardiac morphology will be analyzed to correlate with echocardiography results.\nAfter fixation, wash the embryos with PBS for 5 min 3 times.\nAfter washes, place the embryos in 70% ethanol. Embryos can be stored in this solution at 4°C or immediately be processed for paraffin embedding.\nPerform dehydration and paraffin embedding steps following general histological practices. In our experience, processing the embryos using an automatic processor gives better and more consistent results.",
    "Once embryos are paraffin-embedded, orientate them in a histological mold. We recommend transversal sections at this gestational stage. To this aim, place the thorax of the embryo with the caudal part (closer to the liver) laying on the bottom of the mold filled with paraffin.\nSectioning and staining:\nObtain paraffin sections of 5 microns thickness using a microtome.\nStore sections at 4°C to perform immunostaining or at 20°C–25°C for routine histological staining (H&E, Masson Trichrome, etc). For in situ hybridization, 10 microns sections should be stored at –20°C.\nMorphological analysis by microscopy:\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained sections can be analyzed using a bright field microscope. In our mouse models, we correlated the observations in the echocardiography acquisition with the H&E analysis, including the interventricular septum defects and the ventricular wall thickness reduction in VHL mutants compared to controls, as described in the next section.\nTroubleshooting 3\nQuantification of histological parameters\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis last part of the protocol describes how to quantify morphological parameters using ImageJ software and H&E stained embryo sections.\nAcquire a full transversal section of the embryonic heart after H&E staining. Use an anatomical position where the ventricles are open and the atrioventricular valves are present (4-chamber view, Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1206-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

This will set up the scale of the image and will allow to obtain further measurements in microns.\nTroubleshooting 4\nUsing the straight-line tool, draw a line from the epicardium to the base of the trabeculae, covering the whole thickness of the compact myocardium (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nPerform the measures in the bottom outer quarter of the ventricles within the highlighted area in the figure.\nMake 3 measurements per ventricle on the lateral wall as indicated in the inset (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B). The average of these 3 length measures represents the relative compact wall thickness in microns.",
    "Using the same tool, measure the relative width of the interventricular septum in its central area from one endocardial edge to the other side of the septum (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C).\nAverage the 3 length measures of each area. This is the mean value per animal. Perform biological replicates as needed.\nFor the quantification of chamber sphericity, indicative of dilatation (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D):\nMeasure the major axis of the chamber from the intersection of the valve with the ventricular wall on the basal region to the most apical region of each chamber, at the epicardial level.\nMeasure the minor axis of the chamber from the epicardial level to the septum endocardium at the midplane of the chamber.\nThe sphericity is calculated as: minor axis length/major axis length.\nNote: Values closer to 1 indicate more spherical shape (chamber dilatation). This parameter should correlate with ventricular inner diameter and volume determined by echocardiography."
