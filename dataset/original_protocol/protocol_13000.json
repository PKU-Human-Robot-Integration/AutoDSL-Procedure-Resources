    "1. Sample preparation\nUse grids containing gold foil and gold grid support16 (see Table of Materials) because tilted data collection can accentuate beam-induced motion17.\n\tNOTE: For the present study, samples on grids were vitrified using the manual plunging and blotting technique18 in a humidified (greater than 80%) cold room (~4 °C).\nAvoid using grids containing copper support and carbon foil or a continuous layer of amorphous carbon unless absolutely necessary, as these grids may lead to greater beam-induced motion16 when the specimen stage is tilted.\n\tNOTE: Alternative support layers, such as graphene/graphene oxide, appear to reduce beam-induced movement compared to amorphous carbon19,20.\nPre-screen grids and identify regions characterized by acceptable ice thickness and particle distribution. Grids containing too tightly packed particles will lead to particle overlap during tilted data collection, which may affect downstream data-processing steps.\n\tNOTE: These steps are subjective since identifying good areas of ice is performed by visually inspecting defocused images for regions where particle contrast is clear. This may not be feasible for all samples since some samples will not distribute efficiently in areas of thin ice, leading to challenges during data collection (described in the Discussion section).\nVitrify the grids containing your protein sample. Here, for demonstration purposes, we use DNA Protection during Starvation (DPS) protein (see Table of Materials) at a range from 0.1-0.5 mg/mL with gold foil and gold support grids.\n\t​NOTE: The protein was purified as described previously, except no TEV protease cleavage was performed21. The protein concentration range for a sample of interest will have to be optimized individually, since it is hard to gauge an ideal range that is universally applicable and will almost certainly vary between different samples.\n2. Setting up tilted data collection\nAlign the microscope to ensure parallel illumination of the specimen and minimize coma aberrations22.",
    "NOTE: The microscope must be well aligned for standard SPA data collection without stage tilt. No special alignments are necessary for tilted data collection, but a good alignment will ensure that targeting and imaging proceed smoothly. A general scheme comparing tilted and untilted data collection is provided in Figure 2.\nRecord a grid atlas without stage tilt to identify squares suitable for data collection or manually inspect squares at the magnification used in Square Acquisition Node. Look for squares where the foil is intact, does not look dehydrated, and has ideal ice thickness.\n\tNOTE: Square Acquisition Node is the low-magnification node used for multi-scale imaging in Leginon.\n\t\nFor typical untilted automated data collection, record a grid atlas, which provides an overview of the overall grid quality and an initial indication of suitable areas for data collection.\nSubsequently, select suitable squares through the atlas and submit them to the queue. Then, either through manual selection of holes or through the automated EM hole finder, queue and submit the hole targets.\nFinally, use the automated EM hole finder for submitting high magnification exposure targets.\n\t\tNOTE: For tilted data collection, squares may need to be queued manually for consistent results, especially if the optimal tilt angle has not been pre-determined and is likely to be adjusted during data collection. The grid atlas could also be recorded using a pre-defined stage tilt if the tilt angle used for data collection had previously been established.\nMove the specimen stage to a square of interest.\nDetermine the eucentric height for the stage position using α-wobbler at ± 15° stage tilt. Adjust the Z-height to bring the stage to eucentric height using the keypad panel for the microscope. Ensure the image shift is minimal during the α-wobble routine.",
    "NOTE: If the eucentric height is not properly identified, a large image shift will be observed upon tilting the stage at the square magnification. This can also happen if there are local deformations on the grid, for example, if the grid is broken or severely bent in the vicinity of the imaged area. Although it is best to avoid such regions for data collection, it is imperative to accurately estimate eucentric height if these represent one of the few promising regions for data collection. Figure 3 shows how targeting without properly identifying eucentric height can cause large image shifts in the square magnification.\nFind a more accurate Z-height, use the Focuser node, and press Simulate.\n\t\nTypically, estimate the Z-height in the Focuser node at the magnification used in Square Acquisition Node.\n\t\tNOTE: The Focuser node focus sequence can also include a fine Z focus estimation at the Hole Acquisition node (a tool in Leginon software) magnification during data collection.\nAdjust the settings for the Focuser node and enable/disable the fine Z focus option during the initial queuing of squares.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to ensure that eucentric height is accurately identified when automated data collection begins, which may require re-enabling fine Z focus (step 2.10).\nTilt the specimen stage to the desired tilt angle for data collection at the true eucentric height, and re-center the stage if necessary. 0°, 30°, and 60° tilt angles were used for this study. Press Simulate in the Square Acquisition node to begin queuing targets for Hole Acquisition node exposures.",
    "NOTE: As indicated in step 2.2.1, the grid atlas can be recorded using a pre-defined stage tilt, which would obviate the need to tilt the stage again at this step. This works well and speeds up the process if the tilt angle used for data collection is pre-defined. The current protocol is written with new specimens in mind, wherein the user may wish to test different tilt angles for data collection.\nSelect a Z focus target and regions with holes suitable for high magnification exposures.\nPress Submit targets to queue for imaging. Do not press Submit Queued Targets until finished queuing up all squares.\nBring the specimen stage back to its untilted state. Move to the next square and repeat steps 2.3-2.8 until an adequate number of hole exposures have been queued.\nGo to the Hole Targeting Node and press Submit Queued Targets once all squares are queued.\n\tNOTE: If fine Z focus was disabled previously to save time (step 2.5), it needs to be re-enabled before submitting the queue.\nManually inspect targets selected by the high magnification Exposure Acquisition node to test if the automated EM hole finder can accurately identify suitable regions for image acquisition when the specimen stage is tilted.\n\t\nDuring this procedure, select 'Allow for user verification of selected targets' in Exposure Acquisition node settings. Once the user is satisfied with targeting accuracy, deselect this option for automated data collection.\n\t\t​NOTE: Targets in high magnification Exposure Acquisition node are typically imaged using a beam-tilt image shift strategy, which works equally well for both tilted and untilted data collection23,24,25,26. For accurate CTF estimation in downstream data processing steps, the lens-coma aberration calibration must be performed for the beam-tilt image shift data collection strategy.\n3. Data Processing",
    "Initiate on-the-fly data processing10,27,28,29 with motion-correction of recordedmovies, CTF estimation, particle selection, and generation of initial reconstructions during data collection.\n\tNOTE: For the present study, cryoSPARC Live10 (see Table of Materials) has been utilized for pre-processing. On-the-fly data processing provides an initial cryo-EM reconstruction and an approximation for the angular distribution, which can inform the user about the extent of resolution anisotropy. These can, in turn, be used to guide the user as to whether or not the tilt angle used for data collection is sufficiently high.\nVisualize the reconstructed map and plot the Euler angle distribution to gauge the extent of preferred particle orientations.\n\tNOTE: The Euler angle distributions can be converted directly into Fourier space sampling distributions to determine the potential extent of resolution anisotropy. A graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed to assist the user in evaluating the quality of an Euler angle distribution and determining an optimal tilt angle30,31. The tool can be obtained from the Github repository, https://github.com/LyumkisLab/SamplingGui.\nIf necessary, adjust the stage tilt angle at which data is collected to overcome the effects of preferential orientation. The angle can be increased if the preferential orientation remains a problem, as evidenced by the map and Euler distribution in 3.2. Alternatively, the user may wish to split the data collection into groups and record using several different tilt angles, such as 20°, 30°, and 40°.\n\tNOTE: Although most TEMs must have the capability of tilting the stage to 70°, common specimen stage tilts (that we have used) range from 20°-40°.\nSubscription Required.
