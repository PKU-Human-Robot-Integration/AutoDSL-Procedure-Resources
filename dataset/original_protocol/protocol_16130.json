    "A variety of protocols have been described over the years in regard to gene cloning (Curtis & Grossniklaus, 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20099#cppb20099-bib-0008]; Katzen, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20099#cppb20099-bib-0015]; Walhout et al., 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20099#cppb20099-bib-0034]). Described here is the gene cloning protocol used in our lab. A two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to clone the genes of interest and link them to the donor vector using the Gateway BP reaction. As some genes cannot be linked to the donor vector by the Gateway BP reaction, we have alternatively used In-Fusion or Gibson assembly to sub-clone these genes (see Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20099#cppb20099-prot-0002]). Next, the genes of interest are recombined into the destination vector by the Gateway LR reaction, under the control of the plant ubiquitin 10 promoter (Grefen et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20099#cppb20099-bib-0011]).\nMaterials\nNuclease-free water\nPhusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase (ThermoFisher Scientific, F530L) and corresponding 5× buffer\ndNTP mix (New England Biolabs, cat. no.

    "Protein complexes can be isolated through in vivo immunoprecipitation methods by using specific antibodies recognizing the bait protein. Given that it is incredibly laborious to directly use specific antibodies against plant proteins, an affinity tag protein (GFP or GS tag) fused to the protein of interest facilitates the development of a high-throughput affinity purification method for protein complexes (Van Leene et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20099#cppb20099-bib-0032]).

    "In-solution enzymatic protein digestion is a useful, and sometimes necessary, alternative to in-gel digestion. For samples of low content, or for samples not amenable to SDS-PAGE, in-solution digestion can be used and will provide similar results to in-gel digestion. However, protein folding can protect the amino acid chain from enzymatic cleavage, so denaturation is necessary for efficient cleavage. The conundrum with in-solution digestion is finding conditions to denature the sample without denaturing the protease. Detergents cannot be used in the denaturation process, since they will interfere with subsequent MS analysis. Common denaturants that we use in our laboratory for in-solution digestions include 8 M urea in 10 mM Tris·Cl (pH 8.0), 8 M guanidine HCl (pH 8.0), and 6 M urea/2 M thiourea in 10 mM Tris·Cl (pH 8.0). Unfortunately, trypsin, the most common protease for MS analysis, is not stable under any of these conditions, but fortunately another enzyme, LysC protease, is. LysC cleaves on the carboxyl side of lysine residues, while trypsin targets both lysine and arginine residues.\nMaterials\nProtein sample of interest\n6 M urea/2 M thiourea in 10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8\nReduction buffer: 1 μg/μl (6.5 mM) dithiothreitol (DTT) in water\nAlkylation buffer: 5 μg/μl (27 mM) iodoacetamide in water\n10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8\nTrypsin/LysC proteases, modified sequencing grade (Promega): 0.4 µg/µl; i.e., in 50 µl, 20 µg)\n100% methanol\n80% (v/v) acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in distilled deionized water\n0.1% and 2% (v/v) TFA in distilled deionized water\nResuspension solution: 0.2% (v/v) TFA/5% acetonitrile\nEquilibration buffer A (100% H2O/0.2% TFA)\nElution buffer B (100% acetonitrile/0.2% TFA)\nBath sonicator\nRefrigerated centrifuge\npH strips\nC18 SepPak columns, 100 mg/ml\nVisiprep™ 12- Port Vacuum Manifold (Sigma, 57044)\nVacuum pump\nSpeedVac evaporator",

Dissolve sample in a small volume of 6 M urea/2 M thiourea (pH 8.0). Use as low a volume as is compatible with your sample. Sonicate for 10 min to solubilize using a bath sonicator.\nIn this procedure, all steps are performed at room temperature to reduce unwanted derivatization of amino acid side-chains by the denaturants.\n2. Centrifuge samples 10 min at 8000 × g, room temperature, to pellet any insoluble material.\nThe pH of the final solution should be near 8.0 for optimal trypsin digestion. Check this with pH strips.\n3. Add 1 μl reduction buffer for every 50 μg of sample protein and incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nOnly a very rough estimate of protein content is necessary—where sample amount is limited, it is better to sacrifice accuracy than waste sample on a protein assay.\n4. Add 1 μl alkylation buffer for every 50 μg sample protein and incubate for 20 min at room temperature in the dark.\n5. Dilute sample with four volumes of 10 mM Tris·Cl, pH 8.\nThis step is absolutely necessary to dilute the urea concentration, as trypsin/LysC is very sensitive to high concentrations of salt.\n6. Add 1 μl of 0.4 µg/µl trypsin/LysC per 50 μg sample protein and incubate overnight at 37°C.\nSamples should not be stored in liquid. We highly recommend desalting the samples directly after the digestion.",
    "Trypsin and LysC perform optimally at pH 8.0, but we have successfully extracted a sample in 6 M urea/2 M thiourea, pelleted the insoluble material, and solubilized this pellet with 8 M guanidine HCl, pH 1.5, and also combined the guanidine and urea to achieve a higher degree of sample solubility than either denaturant alone. As a bonus, Tris buffering of the urea is sufficient to maintain the combined solution at or near pH 8.0 when combining equal volumes of the two.\nC18 Stage- SepPak for peptide desalting and concentration\n7. Put the C18 Stage-SepPak columns in the Visiprep™ 12- Port Vacuum Manifolds and attach the vacuum pump.\n8. Equilibrate the C18 SepPak columns with 1 ml 100% methanol and switch on the pump.\n9. Equilibrate the C18 SepPak columns with 1 ml 80% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA in distilled, deionized water and switch on the pump.\n10. Equilibrate with 1 ml of 0.1% TFA in distilled deionized water and switch on the pump. Repeat this step.\n11. Dissolve samples in 0.1% TFA (add 1/10 volume of 2% TFA to reach pH 2.0). If the pH is too high, add 2% TFA, until it reaches a pH of 2.0.\nIt is very important to reach pH 2.0 for the peptide to bind to the column.\n12. Load the sample onto the SepPak columns, and switch on the pump.\n13. Wash the tube that contained the digested sample with 200 µl 0.1% TFA, centrifuge 1 min at 1000 × g, and load this onto the column.\n14. Wash the column with 1 ml of 0.1% TFA. Repeat this step.\n15. Elute the peptides with 800 μl of 60% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA into a new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube.\n16. Dry the peptides in a SpeedVac evaporator.",
    "Samples can be stored dry at −80°C for a long time.\n17. Using a Nano LC 1000 liquid chromatograph with a reversed-phase C18 column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC, 75 µm × 150 mm, C18, 2 µm, 100 Å), perform mass spectrometric analysis as required by the experiment.\nHere, we suggest using neutral-loss scanning and multistage activation.\n18. Add a final volume of 40 µl of resuspension solution (0.2% TFA/5% acetonitrile) to the sample and transfer it to a microtiter plate for mass spectrometric analysis.\nLC-MS/MS analysis can be performed on a Q Exactive Plus (ThermoFisher Scientific).\nA Nano LC 1000 (ThermoFisher Scientific) and reversed-phase C18 column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC, 75 µm × 150 mm, C18, 2 µm, 100 Å) are used to resolve peptides.\nA gradient is prepared using Equilibration buffer A (100% H2O/0.2% TFA) and elution buffer B (100% acetonitrile; 0.2% TFA). Gradient should be run as follows: 5 min from 0 up to 10% buffer B with 300 nl/min flow, 30 min up to 20% buffer B with flow 300 nl/min, 8 min up to 40% buffer B with flow 300 nl/min, followed by wash for 2 min with 80% buffer B at flow of 300 nl/min, 5 min with 80% buffer B at flow of 500 nl/min, and 5 min with 0% buffer B at flow of 500 nl/min.\nQ Exactive Plus Full MS scan settings are resolution 60,000, AGC target 3e6, maximum IT 100 ms, scan range 150 to 1600 m/z.\nMS2 scan settings are resolution 15,000, AGC target 2e5, loop count 15, isolation window 2 m/z, collision energy.\nData-dependent acquisition settings are apex trigger on, charge exclusion 1.5-8, >8.\nQuantitative analysis of MS/MS measurements is performed using the Progenesis IQ software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, U.K.).",
    "Proteins are identified from spectra using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK). Mascot search parameters are set as follows: TAIR10 protein annotation, requirement for tryptic ends, one missed cleavage allowed, fixed modification: carbamidomethylation (cysteine), variable modification: oxidation (methionine), peptide mass tolerance = ±10 ppm, MS/MS tolerance = ±0.6 Da, allowed peptide charges of +2 and +3. A decoy database search is used to limit false discovery rates to 1% on the protein level. Peptide identifications below rank 1 or with a Mascot ion score below 25 are excluded. Mascot results are imported into Progenesis QI, quantitative peak area information extracted, and the results exported for data plotting and statistical analysis.",
    "The ribosome protein and translation-related protein could be deleted at this step. The normalized signal intensities are processed to determine fold-change abundance (FC-A) scores by use of the SAINT algorithm embedded within the CRAPome software (Mellacheruvu et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20099#cppb20099-bib-0021]). Compared with the GFP control, the background protein could be deleted at this step by FC-A values of at least four within at least three replicates (Morris et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20099#cppb20099-bib-0023]). MS/MS information from the SUBA4 database (Hooper, Castleden, Tanz, Aryamanesh, & Millar, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20099#cppb20099-bib-0013]) could give the subcellular localization of the bait and prey, and thus improve the reliably of the interactions. Finally, we consider only the protein pairs for which the intensities are in the top 2% compared with the bait intensity to represent positive interactions.\n1. Following the LC-MS measurement, the ribosomal and translation-related proteins can be deleted unless there is a specific interest in translation-regulatory proteins.\n2. The normalized intensity of all the bait and tag control lines can be analyzed by the CRAPome software (you need to follow the introduction to the software to prepare the interaction files (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20099#cppb20099-fig-0004]A).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/76100fb1-e397-4687-b7ef-7ad04c4b6c09/cppb20099-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nData analysis. (A) Examples to prepare the Excel files for the CRAPome software analysis. (B) Histogram of FC-A score. Data are displayed in a table format and in different graphical formats. The standard primary fold-change calculation (FC-A) averages the counts across all controls, while the more stringent secondary fold-change score (FC-B) takes the average of the top three highest spectral counts for the abundance estimate. (C) Visualization: FC-A versus FC-B. The conservative FC scores readily distinguish between the contaminant and true interaction partner.",
    "3. After getting the resulting lists of candidate interactors with the corresponding fold change (FC; Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20099#cppb20099-fig-0004]B and C), interactions with FC greater than 4 can be selected as possible positive interactions. Only the intensities of interactors that have greater than 2% of the intensity of the GFP protein are selected.\n4. The possible target prey proteins also need to be analyzed by the SUBA4 database to get the right subcellular localization with the bait protein.\n5. The protein interaction network can be presented by Cytoscape (https://cytoscape.org/[href=https://cytoscape.org/]; Shannon et al., 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20099#cppb20099-bib-0030])."
