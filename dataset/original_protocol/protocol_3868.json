    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIn vitro spectral unmixing of two bioluminescent cell populations\nTiming: 3 days\nPlate mixtures of HEK-CBG2 and HEK-CBR2 cells in the following ratios: 100:0, 75:25, 50:50 for HEK-CBG2:HEKCBR2 and vice versa. Plate them in a 96-well black plate with clear bottom at the density of 1 × 104 cells / 100 μL per well and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. For statistical analysis, two triplicates should be considered.\nThe next day, prepare NH2-NpLH2 substrate at final concentration of 2 mM in PBS.\nCritical: Keep the NH2-NpLH2 luciferin solution protected from light and store it at −20°C. If the color changes, discard and make fresh luciferin solution.\nPrior to imaging the plate, replace DMEM culture media with PBS and resuspend the cells in 100 μL PBS per well. This will avoid interference by colored media while measuring the photon flux.\nAdd 10 μL NH2-NpLH2 substrate (2 mM) to each well containing plated cells in 200 μL PBS. Final concentration of NH2-NpLH2 substrate will be 0.1 mM.\nStart imaging 10 min after substrate addition to collect the maximum number of photons.\nSet up imaging settings at the IVIS spectrum system with open filter, 30 s exposure time, field of view (FOV) C, f/stop=1, medium binning.\nSelect bandpass filters ranged from 580 nm to 800 nm to measure the spectra of interest (starting from the lowest to the highest filter)\nWith the guided spectral library tool, create specific libraries for pure HEK-CBG2 cells (100%) and HEK-CBR2 cells (100%).\nUse the relevant libraries of HEK-CBG2 cells (100%) and HEK-CBR2 cells (100%) and apply them to perform the spectral unmixing in wells where unknown HEK-CBG2: HEK-CBR2 cell mixtures are plated.\nThe resolved HEK-CBG2 and HEK-CBR2 emission will appear as separated images where quantification is possible.",
    "Note: A detailed guide on how to perform spectral unmixing is reported as technical note on Perkin Elmer website (https://resources.perkinelmer.com/labsolutions/resources/docs/TCH_011047_01_Spectral_Unmixing.pdf[href=https://resources.perkinelmer.com/labsolutions/resources/docs/TCH_011047_01_Spectral_Unmixing.pdf] )\nNormalize the emission spectra so that the CBG2 and CBR2 emission peaks can be visualized.\nFor well plate image analysis, calculate light outputs for the HEK-CBG2 and HEK-CBR2 emission by drawing Region Of Interest (ROI) by Living image software 4.5 (Perkin Elmer). Place a ROI over the signal in each well and select “measure”. The software will record the BL outputs in photon flux (photons/sec).\nExport data outputs to Excel (Microsoft) sheet to measure the average amongst triplicates and relative standard deviations.\nNote: the substrate is light sensitive and must be kept in the dark. We recommend receiving training on using the IVIS Spectrum.\nIn vivo spectral unmixing of two cell populations\nTiming: 2 days\nCulture separately HEK-CBG2 and HEK-CBR2 cells in a T75 flask (cell density ∼ 1× 106/mL) and incubate at 37°C for 24 h.\nThe next day, prepare NH2-NpLH2 substrate solubilized in PBS at the final concentration of 44 mg mL−1 (4.4 mg NH2-NpLH2 in 100 μL of PBS per 20 g mouse corresponds to a dose of 220 mg Kg−1).\nCritical: Keep NH2-NpLH2 luciferin solution protected from light and. If the color changes, discard and make fresh luciferin solution.\nPrior in vivo imaging, wash HEK-CBG2 and HEK-CBR2 cells twice with DPBS and resuspend them in sterile DPBS.\nPrepare cell aliquots (final concentration 1 × 106 /100 μL sterile DPBS per mouse) for 100% HEK-CBG2, 100% HEK-CBR2 and for various ratios for HEK-CBG2: HEK-CBR2 and vice versa.\nSet up imaging settings at the IVIS spectrum imager system with open filter, 30 s exposure time, field of view (FOV) C, f/stop=1, medium binning.",
    "Select bandpass filters ranged from 540 nm to 800 nm to measure the spectra of interest (starting from the lowest to the highest filter)\nRegister guided spectral libraries of 100% luciferase-HEK293T (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]):\nAnesthetize BALB/C nude mice (females, aged 6–10 weeks) with 1.5%–2.0% isoflurane (flow rate 1 L/min O2).\nInject 100 μL 100% HEK-CBG2 or 100% HEK-CBR2 cells with intravenous injections (I.V.)\nInject 220 mg Kg−1 of NH2-NpLH2 substrate solubilized in DPBS intraperitoneally (I.P.)\nNote: We recommend pre-loading one syringe per mouse. All mice must be injected with luciferin within a few seconds of each other. This also reduces differences in dosage and enhance the accuracy.\nPerform the spectral imaging 10 min post I.P. injection to measure the highest light output.\nWith the guided spectral library tool (in the ROI menu), create specific libraries for pure in vivo signals for HEK-CBG2 injected (100%) and for HEK-CBR2 injected (100%) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nSpectral unmixing for unknown HEK-CBG2: HEK-CBR2 cell ratios:\nAnesthetize nude mice with 1.5%–2.0% isoflurane (flow rate 1 L/min O2).\nInject 100 μL HEK-CBG2: HEK-CBR2 and vice versa at different cell ratios with intravenous injections (I.V.)\nPerform the spectral imaging 10 min post i.p. injection to let the substrate stabilize and allow the measurement of highest light outputs.\nAfter imaging, the mice can be placed back into their respective cages. They should be awake within 30 s to 1 min.\nFor spectral imaging, choose band pass filters between 620–800 nm and select the relevant guided library registered for in vivo spectra of HEK-CBG2 cells (100%) or HEK-CBR2 cells (100%) on the ROI menu.\nApply the relevant libraries to perform the spectral unmixing for unknown HEK-CBG2: HEK-CBR2 cell ratios and draw a mask where the cell mixtures are expected to be localized after i.v. injections",
    "Proceed with spectral unmixing, the algorithm will separate HEK-CBG2 and HEK-CBR2 cell contributions\nTwo unmixed images will be built each containing the signature of only one of the luciferases of interest.\nTo calculate light outputs for the unmixed images, draw Region of Interest (ROI) by Living image software 4.5 (Perkin Elmer). Place a ROI over the signal.\nExport data outputs to Excel (Microsoft) to measure the average amongst triplicates and relative standard deviations. Graph the “total flux” column.\nPerform the in vivo experiment with at least three mice\nCritical: Ear tags are necessary to distinguish mice during the luciferin injections.\nNote: Up to five mice can be imaged and keep the stage heated to 37°C during the in vivo imaging. Total imaging time acquisition is about 6 min.\nWe recommend receiving training on using the IVIS Spectrum as well as its accompanying isoflurane anesthesia machine.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/781-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Illustration of the spectral unmixing for co-localized bioluminescent signals in vivo\n1) Create and save the specific libraries for pure (100% cell ratio) HEK-CBG2 and HEK-CBR2 in the database.\n2) Use the relevant libraries to unmix the emission outputs when HEK-CBG2 and HEK-CBR2 are co-injected i.v. in the same mouse.\n3) Use the spectral unmixing algorithm to separate and quantify the unmixed images. Normalized emission curves can be plotted highlighting the luciferase emission peaks. Scale bar: Radiance (ph/s/cm2/sr).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/781-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Step-by-step spectral unmixing\n(A) Save the specific luciferase spectrum to create a pure (100% cell ratio) HEK-CBG2 or HEK-CBR2 library.\n(B) Perform spectral unmixing by loading opportune pure libraries. The algorithm will be able to distinguish each luciferase contribution even if the two luciferases are colocalized in the same area. Scale bar: radiance (ph/s/cm2/sr).
