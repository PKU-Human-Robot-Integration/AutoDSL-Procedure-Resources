    "NOTE: Testes from 1-week-old piglets were obtained from a commercial pig farm as by-product from castration of commercial pigs. Sourcing of testes was approved by the Animal Care Committee at the University of Calgary.\n1. Preparation of enzyme solutions for tissue digestion\nNOTE: Three different enzymatic solutions are needed, which include two different collagenase IV solutions (solution A, B) and a deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) solution.\nTo prepare solution A, dissolve 20 mg of collagenase IV S (Table of Materials) and 40 mg of collagenase IV W (Table of Materials) in 25 mL of high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM). Then filter sterilize with a 0.22 µm filter. Add 0.4 mL of fetal bovine serum (FBS) to solution A to inhibit trypsin activity.\nTo prepare solution B, dissolve 80 mg of collagenase IV W (Table of Materials) in 40 mL of DMEM. Then filter sterilize with a 0.22 µm filter.\nTo prepare DNase I solution (7 mg/mL), dissolve 70 mg of DNase I in 10 mL of DMEM. Then filter sterilize with a 0.22 µm filter.\n\tNOTE: The enzyme concentration for collagenase IV solutions outlined here, varies from the concentrations (2 mg/mL) stated in the original article14. The current protocol yields cells with slightly higher viability. However, cells isolated by both protocols produce organoids with identical tissue architecture.\n2. Testis tissue enzymatic digestion\nCollect the testes into a sterile beaker and wash with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S). After washing, transfer the testes to a 100 mm tissue culture dish with PBS containing 1% P/S and remove the tunica vaginalis and epididymis using autoclaved scissors and forceps. Transfer the isolated testes to a new 100 mm dish and wash thoroughly with PBS containing 1% P/S.",
    "To maintain sterility, use another set of sterile scissors and forceps to peel the testicular parenchyma out of the tunica albuginea. Cut the testes along the longitudinal axis directly under the tunica. Then peel the testes out of the tunica using two forceps and place into a new 100 mm dish containing of 1 mL DMEM with 1% P/S.\nMince the peeled testes with sterile scissors into 1-2 mm tissue pieces. After chopping, use sterile forceps to remove white fragments of connective tissue.\nTransfer the minced tissue pieces into solution A and top it up to 50 mL with DMEM to obtain a concentration of 0.4 mg/mL for collagenase IV S (Table of Materials) and a concentration of 0.8 mg/mL for collagenase IV W (Table of Materials). Place solution A containing the tissue pieces into a 37 °C water bath for 30 min, gently invert the tubes every 5 min and check visually for the release of DNA.\n\t\nAdd 500 µL of DNase I if free floating DNA is observed. After 30 min, centrifuge the tube at 90 x g with brakes at 25 °C for 1.5 min and discard the supernatant.\n\t\tNOTE: DNA would appear as a cloudy substance. When the tubes are shaken, the tissue pieces settle down whereas the DNA would stay afloat.\nAdd solution B to the tube and top up to 50 mL with DMEM to obtain a concentration of 1.2 mg/mL of collagenase IV W (Table of Materials). Place the tube into 37 °C water bath for 30 min and gently invert the tube every 5 min. Add 500 µL of DNase I if free floating DNA is observed.",
    "After 30 min, centrifuge the tube at 90 x g with brakes at 25 °C for 1.5 min. After that discard the supernatant and wash once with PBS with 1% P/S.\n\tNOTE: The discarded supernatants from both solution A and B will primarily contain interstitial cells.\nTop up the tube with PBS up to 50 mL. Carefully collect the tubules from the top and place into a new 50 mL tube.\n\tNOTE: The big undigested tissue fragments quickly settle at the bottom, while digested seminiferous tubules will remain in suspension. No big tissue fragments should be collected. This procedure can be repeated several times until the solution in the original tube is almost clear and just undigested tissue fragments are remaining, which can be disposed.\nCentrifuge the tubules at 90 x g with brakes at 25 °C for 1.5 min and discard the supernatant. Add fresh PBS and centrifuge again. Repeat this wash step twice.\nAfter the last PBS wash, remove the supernatant and resuspend the seminiferous tubules in 5 mL of PBS. Then add 15 mL of 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to the tubules. Place the tube in 37 °C water bath and gently invert every 2 min. If a lot of free-floating DNA is observed, add 500 µL of DNase I with 5 mL of DMEM.\nEvaluate the enzymatic digestion of tubules to single cells under the microscope (first after 5 min, then every 2 min). If mostly single cells can be detected, stop the reaction with 5 mL of FBS and filter through a 70 µm mesh and then through a 40 µm mesh.",
    "NOTE: Care should be taken that the caps on the 50 mL tubes used for digestions (Solution A, B and 0.25% trypsin-EDTA) are tightened properly. If contamination in the water bath is a concern, paraffin film may be wrapped around the cap to ensure sterility.\nCentrifuge the single cells at 500 x g with brakes at 25 °C for 5 min, resuspend in the enrichment medium (Dulbecco Modified Eagle Medium F/12 (DMEM/F12) containing 5% FBS and 1% P/S) and count the number of viable cells. This is the starting cell population. Fix 100 x 103 cells and perform immunocytochemistry for germ cell marker UCHL1 (Ubiquitin C-Terminal Hydrolase L1) as described12 and determine the percentage of germ cells in this starting cell population.\n\tNOTE: Germ cell marker Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF)15 could also be used as a suitable alternative for UCHL1. In the starting cell population, the expected cell yield is around 700-800 x 109/g of tissue. The percentage of germ cells in this cell population should be 4-5%.\nPlace around 20 x 106 of this starting cell population in two ultra low attachment 100 mm Petri dishes (10 x 106 cells suspended in 10 mL of DMEM/F12 containing 1% P/S in each dish) for 2 days in a tissue culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 21% oxygen). Perform the germ cell enrichment with the remaining cells.\n\tNOTE: To ensure optimum viability and cell quality, while the germ cell enrichment and subsequent quantification takes place, the starting cell population is placed in culture in ultra low attachment tissue culture dishes for 2 days.\n3. Germ cell enrichment\nNOTE: The procedure described above yields primarily Sertoli cells and germ cells. Different adhesion properties allow for the separation of Sertoli cells and germ cells via differential plating.",
    "Seed 20-25 x 106 cells of the starting cell population per 100 mm tissue culture dish in a total volume of 8 mL of enrichment medium (DMEM/F12 with 5% FBS and 1% P/S) for differential plating. Place the cells into an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 21% O2) and after 1.5 h, ensure that the majority of Sertoli cells attach to the plate.\nCollect and combine the supernatant (mainly containing germ cells) of 2 plates to one new 100 mm plate and place it back into the incubator. After 1 h, again combine the supernatant of 2 plates to a new 100 mm plate. Place the plates back into the incubator for overnight.\n\tNOTE: The supernatants combined will primarily contain germ cells. The adhered cells that are discarded along with the plates are primarily testicular somatic cells such as Sertoli and peritubular myoid cells.\nCollect the enriched germ cells in two fractions as follows.\n\tNOTE: Enriched germ cells adhere differently, non adherent fraction and slightly adhered fraction. Both these fractions together form the enriched germ cell population\n\t\nNon adherent fraction: collect the supernatant.\nSlightly adherent fraction: wash the plates gently with PBS, treat with 2 mL of 1:20 dilution of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 5 min at room temperature, stop the reaction with 2 mL of enrichment medium and collect in the same tube as non adherent fraction.\n\t\tNOTE: 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA needs to be diluted with PBS to produce a 1:20 trypsin solution.\nCount the total number of cells using a cell counter, fix 100 x 103 cells and perform immunocytochemistry for germ cell marker UCHL1 as described12 and determine the percentage of germ cells in this enriched cell population.",
    "NOTE: The percentage of germ cells in this cell population should be at least 60-70%. Since the immunocytochemistry for quantification would require 1 day, the enriched cells should be placed in an ultra low attachment 100 mm Petri dish with DMEM/F12 supplemented with 1% P/S for the duration to ensure optimum cell quality and viability.\n4. Preparation of cells for seeding\nTo harvest the starting cell preparation, collect the supernatant in a 50 mL tube from the ultra low attachment 100 mm dishes. Wash the plates vigorously with PBS to collect the adhered cells. No enzymatic digestion is needed.\n\tNOTE: Some of the testicular cells, primarily Sertoli cells, can slightly adhere to the ultra low attachment plates.\nCombine the starting cell preparation and enriched germ cells to obtain a working cell preparation containing 25% germ cells. Centrifuge at 500 x g with brakes at 25 °C for 5 min, discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in organoid formation medium (DMEM/F12 supplemented with insulin 10 µg/mL, transferrin 5.5 µg/mL, selenium 6.7 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 1% P/S). Adjust the cell density to 2.4 x 106 per mL.\n\tNOTE: Each well in the microwell plates used13 in this protocol contained 1,200 microwells.\nUse the formula below to calculate the number of cells per well as described below.\n\tNumber of cells per well = number of microwells x number of cells to be clustered for each organoid.",
    "To generate organoids from 1, 000 cells each, seed each with (1,200 x 1,000 cells each=) 1.2 x 106 cells. Adjust the cell density in the cell suspension in a way that the cells are seeded in a volume of 0.5 mL of medium. For organoids formed from 1,000 cells each, use a density of 2.4 x 106 cells per mL (1.2 x 106 cells in 0.5 mL).\n5. Preparation of microwells to receive cells\nNOTE: To ensure that the cells do not adhere to the microwell surface, treat with a surfactant rinsing solution that is available for purchase by the manufacturer.\nAdd 0.5 mL of rinsing solution to each well. Ensure that no air bubbles are trapped in the well. To remove air bubbles, if any, centrifuge the plate at 2,000 x g with brakes at 25 °C for 2 min.\nObserve the plate under a low-magnification inverted microscope, to verify that the bubbles have been removed from the microwells. If trapped bubbles are observed, centrifuge again at 2,000 x g with brakes at 25 °C for 2 min to remove any remaining bubbles.\nCover the plate with the lid and incubate for 30 min at room temperature. After the treatment is complete, remove the rinsing solution and immediately wash the plate with sterile water or PBS. Ensure that the plate do not dry out after the treatment with the rinsing solution.\n6. Generation of testicular organoids",
    "Add 0.5 mL of organoid formation medium (without any cells) to each well and centrifuge at 2,000 x g with brakes at 25 °C for 2 min to remove any trapped air bubbles. Observe the well under a low-magnification inverted microscope to verify that the air bubbles have been removed. If trapped bubbles are observed, centrifuge again at 2,000 x g with brakes at 25 °C for 2 min to remove any remaining bubbles.\nAdd 0.5 mL of the working cell suspension and gently mix by pipetting up and down. Centrifuge at 500 x g with brakes at 25 °C for 5 min. Use an inverted microscope to verify that the cells have clustered within the microwells.\nTransfer the plate into a cell culture incubator and culture for 5 days. Change half of the medium every other day.\n\t\nTo change medium without losing any organoids, touch the pipette tip to the wall of the well and lower gently to touch the meniscus and slowly draw the medium. Make sure to follow the meniscus as it drops down. To add fresh medium, touch the pipette tip to the wall of the well on the same side as the medium withdrawal and add fresh medium gently against the well wall, allowing it to slowly flow down the wall.\nTo recover the organoids, gently pipette the medium up and down using a wide mouth pipette. This would allow the organoids to come out of the microwells.\nCollect the organoids, wash with PBS, fix and perform immunocytochemistry for germ cell marker (UCH-L1), Sertoli cell marker (GATA Binding Protein 4-GATA4), peritubular myoid cell marker (α-Smooth Muscle Actin-αSMA) and Leydig cell marker (Cytochrome P450-CYP450) as described12 and visualize under a confocal microscope.\nSubscription Required.
