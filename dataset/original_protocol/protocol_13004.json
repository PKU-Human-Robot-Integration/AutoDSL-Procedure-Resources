    "1. Purification of septin hetero-oligomers\nCo-transformation of bacterial cells with the expression vectors\n\t\nSelect a combination of one pnEA and one pnCS plasmid44 that will be used for expression. Choose the combination depending on the desired subunit composition of the septin hetero-oligomer10,35 and on whether or not fluorescent tagging is required.\n\t\tNOTE: C-terminally tagged monomeric superfolder GFP (msfGFP)-tagged SEPT2 (for human septins) or msfGFP- or monomeric enhanced GFP (mEGFP)-DSep2 (for Drosophila septins) is used here (Table 1).\nPipette 1 μL of each plasmid (~1 ng/μL) into 100 μL of competent BL21 Escherichia coli cells and incubate on ice for 20 min.\nPlace the cells in a water bath at 42 °C for 40 s and then immediately incubate them for 3 min on ice.\nAdd 0.9 mL of lysogeny broth (LB) medium to the cell suspension and let the cells grow for 1 h at 37 °C. Plate 100 μL of cells on warm LB-agar plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 100 μg/mL spectinomycin and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\nGrow bacterial pre-culture\n\t\nFill a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask with 100 mL of Terrific broth (TB) or LB medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 100 μg/mL spectinomycin.\nPick out a single colony from the LB-agar plate with a sterile inoculation loop and transfer it to fresh media from step 1.2.1.\nIncubate at 37 °C in a rotary shaker incubator, either overnight or for at least 6 h.\n\t\tNOTE: From this culture, a glycerol stock can be prepared by mixing the bacterial suspension 1:1 with glycerol and stored at −80 °C. This stock can be used in step 1.2.2. instead of a freshly transformed colony.\nBacterial culture and protein expression induction",
    "Transfer 100 mL of grown bacteria into 5 L of TB or LB containing 50 μg/mL ampicillin and 50 μg/mL spectinomycin.\nGrow this culture at 37 °C in a shaker incubator until it reaches an optical density (OD) measured at a wavelength of 600 nm in the range of 2-3 for unlabeled septins or 0.6-0.8 for msfGFP/mEGFP-labelled septins and induce protein expression by adding a final concentration of 0.5 mM IPTG. The lower OD for the labeled septins is to avoid reaching the death phase in their longer expression time, as detailed in the next step.\nIncubate the cells expressing unlabeled septin hetero-oligomers for 3 h at 37 °C or the cells expressing msfGFP-labelled hetero-oligomers overnight at 17 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The short protein expression time for unlabeled complexes, facilitated by the use of the richer TB medium, is chosen to prevent protein degradation. The longer expression time combined with lower temperature for labeled complexes is chosen to allow for correct folding of the msfGFP tag.\nBacterial lysis and lysate clarification\n\tNOTE: From this point onwards in the purification procedure, keep the protein-containing solution on ice or at 4 °C at all times to prevent proteolytic protein degradation or loss of activity.\n\t\nCollect the cultured cells by centrifuging at 4,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant.\n\t\t\nOptionally, snap-freeze the pellet in this step and store at −80 °C for maximally 6 months. If this option is chosen, make sure to thaw the pellet on ice before continuing.\nDissolve the pellet in 100 mL of lysis buffer (Table 2) and lyse the cells. Choose one of the two options below\n\t\t\nSonicate in 7 cycles of 30 s ON and 59 s OFF with a tip sonicator using 30% amplitude (note that the settings are sonicator-dependent).",
    "Break down the cells in the French press by passing them at least 3x.\nClarify the cell lysate by centrifuging at 20,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C and keep the supernatant. It is recommended to start with step 1.5.1. during this centrifugal step.\nOptionally, take a sample for denaturing electrophoresis, as described in section 2.\nAffinity chromatography for His-tagged proteins\n\tNOTE: This step yields complexes containing human SEPT2 or Drosophila Sep1 using a nickel column (Figure 1B).\n\t\nEquilibrate a pre-packed nickel sepharose high-performance chromatography column with septin buffer (Table 2).\nLoad the clarified supernatant onto the column at 1 mL/min and wash the bound protein with at least three column volumes of septin buffer.\nElute the septin complexes with 50% HisTrap elution buffer (Table 2) at 1 mL/min while collecting 0.5 mL fractions to yield an imidazole concentration of 250 mM.\nPick the fractions containing septin complexes, as indicated by the optical absorbance of the eluate at 280 nm monitored online with a fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system or after the purification with a microvolume spectrophotometer.\n\t\tNOTE: Imidazole absorbs light at 280 nm. This probably explains why the protein peak does not go back to zero absorbance after the septin elution (Figure 2A).\nAffinity chromatography for Strep-II-tagged proteins\n\tNOTE: This step yields complexes containing either human SEPT7 (hexamers), human SEPT9 (octamers), or Drosophila peanut using a Strep-Tactin column (Figure 1B). The chromatography column is based on a modified biotin-streptavidin system. The protein is tagged with modified biotin (Strep-II-tag), and the column contains an engineered streptavidin (Strep-Tactin). Despite being modified from the biotin-streptavidin system, there is no interference between the Strep-Tactin-Strep-II-tag system and the biotin-streptavidin system. The described system is used to avoid interference with reconstitution assays using biotin and streptavidin.",
    "Equilibrate a pre-packed StrepTactin sepharose high-performance chromatography column with septin buffer (Table 2). Load the septin-containing fractions recovered from the nickel column at 1 mL/min and wash the bound protein with at least three column volumes of septin buffer.\nElute the septin complexes with 100% StrepTrap elution buffer (Table 2) at 1 mL/min while collecting 0.5 mL fractions to yield a concentration of 2.5mM desthiobiotin.\n\t\tNOTE: The desthiobiotin in the StrepTrap elution buffer must be dissolved fresh.\nPick the fractions containing septin complexes, as indicated by the optical absorbance of the eluate at 280 nm monitored online with an FPLC system or after the purification with a microvolume spectrophotometer.\n\t\tNOTE: The denaturing electrophoresis is usually done at this point with samples of the column washings and septin fractions. The order of columns can be inverted with indistinguishable results, i.e., the clarified lysate after step 1.4. can be subjected to Strep-Tactin affinity chromatography followed by nickel affinity chromatography.\nDialysis and storage\n\t\nTo remove the desthiobiotin from the final storage solution, dialyze the septin complexes in a ~1:300 sample-to-buffer volume ratio against septin buffer (Table 2) supplemented with 1 mM DTT overnight, or for at least 4 h, at 4 °C using a 30 kDa MWCO dialysis membrane.\nOptionally, concentrate the septins using a 30 kDa MWCO centrifugal concentration column up to the desired concentration. Aim for a concentration of 5-7 μM, as measured via the solution optical absorbance at 280 nm and using a theoretical extinction coefficient calculated via ProtParam (Table 3).\nAliquot the protein complexes into the desired aliquot size, snap-freeze the aliquot, and store it at −80 °C.",
    "NOTE: It is recommended not to store the protein for more than 6 months. In addition, it is recommended to perform regular quality control experiments, especially if the protein is stored for longer than the recommended time.\n2. Quality control of purity and integrity of the septin hetero-oligomer\nNOTE: The hetero-oligomer quality control consists of a set of biochemical and imaging techniques that allow for the detection of the mass and integrity of the septin complexes present in the solution.\nDenaturing electrophoresis to check for the formation of the septin hetero-oligomer with the correct components\n\t\nMix 10 μL of the selected fractions with 10 μL of 2x SDS sample buffer, load them onto a precast 4%-15% TGX gel, and fill the system with Tris/glycine/SDS running buffer.\nRun the electrophoresis for 35 min at 200 V and stain the gel (Table of Materials) to visualize the results. The molecular weights of the individual septin proteins and septin hetero-oligomeric complexes can be found in Table 3.\nMeasure the relative intensity of each band inside each lane containing purified septins in a contrast-inverted image. Do this by calculating the mean intensity of equally sized rectangles around each band and of an equally sized rectangle on a region without any band in the same lane. Then, normalize the values by dividing the intensity of each band by the intensity of the region without bands.\n\t\tNOTE: If the intensity is saturated (for example, values of 255 for an 8-bit image on a contrast-inverted image), skip the lane.\nEnsemble-averaged native size distribution via native electrophoresis",
    "Prepare 800 mL of anode buffer and 200 mL of light blue cathode buffer the day before and store them in the fridge. To prepare the anode buffer, dilute 40 mL of 20x running buffer with 760 mL of type-I deionized water (I-water). To prepare the light blue cathode buffer, dilute 10 mL of 20x running buffer and 1 mL of 20x cathode additive with 189 mL of I-water. The running buffer and cathode additive come with a kit (Table of Materials).\nPrepare 10 μL of the sample by mixing ~500 ng of septin with the needed amount of sample buffer (2.5 μL in this case, due to the use of a 4x sample buffer; see Table of Materials) and enough I-water to reach a volume of 10 μL.\nLoad the samples onto the gel and fill the system with the ice-cold anode and cathode buffers.\nRun the electrophoresis for around 115 min at 150 V with a power supply that does not stop at low currents and stain the gel (Table of Materials) to visualize the results. The molecular weights of the single proteins and complexes calculated based on the sequence can be found in Table 3.\nSingle-molecule mass distribution using mass photometry via interferometric scattering microscopy\n\t\nWash #1.5 glass slides by sonicating them in an ultrasonic cleaner for 5 min in I-water, 5 min in isopropanol, and finally, 5 min in I-water.\nDry two glass slides with a gentle stream of nitrogen gas and place a 7 μL drop of 0.01% Poly-L-Lysine (PLL) solution on the center of one of the slides. Then, place the center of the other slide on top of the PLL drop, orienting the two slides orthogonally for easy separation. Incubate for 30 s.",
    "Wash by immersing in a beaker with I-water 1x and by directly applying a stream of I-water 2x. Then, dry the two slides with a flow of nitrogen gas. These slides can be stored afterward for around 6 weeks at room temperature in dry conditions.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Label the side of the slide that is treated with the PLL to correctly run the experiment.\nJust before the experiment, cut a piece of 2 x 2, 3 x 2, or 3 x 3 gaskets (that yield 4, 6, or 9 imaging chambers/slide, respectively) and stick it on the PLL-treated part of a glass slide while avoiding the glass slide and the gaskets contacting any dirty surface. Place the slide on a light-duty wiper tissue and press on the gaskets with a pipette tip to stick them with the protecting plastic still on the gaskets.\nWarm septin buffer (Table 2) to room temperature and thaw the proteins in hand (keep them on ice afterward).\n\t\tNOTE: iSCAT shows the signal of some detergents and small molecules that resemble protein signals45. DTT is one of those small molecules, and that is why it is not used for this experiment. There is only a trace of DTT coming from the stored septin.\nPlace the slide with gaskets on the commercial mass photometry system containing 19 μL of septin buffer and focus the microscope using the autofocus option. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to check if the found focus is correct. The standard 100x objective that is part of the setup is used here.\nCreate or load a project folder to store the data using File > New Project or File > Load Project.",
    "Pipette 1 μL of sample onto the 19 μL of septin buffer drop (step 2.3.5) used to focus and mix while minimizing the movement of the slide by not touching anything while doing so. Then, record a 6,000-frame video by clicking on Record.\n\t\t\nFor correct analysis, record the following samples: septin buffer, protein mass standard for the calibration of the signal-to-mass ratio (if a recent calibration is available and the environmental conditions have not changed, this sample can be skipped), and 250 nM of septin complexes diluted in septin buffer without DTT (this gives a final concentration of ~12.5 nM).\nAnalyze the videos using the manufacturer's software to obtain the protein mass distribution. Check for good quality data as follows.\n\t\t\nIf the peaks of different septin hetero-oligomers sizes are overlapping too much or too many events are detected (>3,500 events for a 6,000-frames video with the regular field of view of 128 pixels x 34 pixels spanning 10.8 μm x 2.9 μm), decrease the final septin concentration and measure again.\nIf there are not enough counts of single molecules measured (at least 2,500-3,500 for a 6,000-frame video with the regular field of view), increase the septin concentration and measure again.\nDirect imaging of septin complexes via negative stain transmission electron microscopy\n\t\nDilute samples to a concentration of about 50 nM in septin buffer and prepare the staining solution (2% uranyl formate or uranyl acetate in I-water).\n\t\tNOTE: Uranyl formate must be prepared fresh.\nPipette 4 μL of diluted septins onto a glow discharged electron microscopy grid and incubate for 30 s.\nRemove most of the protein solution using a filter paper and wash the grid 2x with septin buffer and 1x with I-water to remove loosely adsorbed septins.",
    "Stain with 2% uranyl acetate or uranyl formate solution in I-water for 1 min, absorb the staining solution with a filter paper, and air-dry the grid for a few minutes.\nScreen the grid using a properly aligned transmission electron microscope to search for regions of enhanced stain and collect about 100 images within these selected areas.\nCollect images at a magnification of at least 50,000x to obtain a pixel size of about 2 Å/pixel and with a defocus varying from −1 μm to −2 μm. Use an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. Preferably, use an automated procedure to collect the data, which will depend on the acquisition software available.\nPerform 2D image processing using dedicated software\n\t\t\nBox out at least 2,000 particles using a dedicated software46.\nPerform two-dimensional alignment and classification iteratively until classes are obtained without further improvement. The first alignment and classification step should be reference-free to avoid any bias in the classification.\nUse the averages obtained from the first reference-free classification as new references to carry out an extra round of classification. Repeat this process iteratively until no further improvement is achieved. Ensure that each class is based on 50 to 100 picked particles, and individual subunits are clearly visible. Different software tools can be used (Spider, Eman, or Relion)46,47,48.\n3. Septin functional quality control via polymerization analysis\nNOTE: The functionality quality control consists of a set of imaging techniques that allow for the detection of polymerized septin complexes. Below, unlabelled septins are referred to as \"dark\" septins, and the buffer used for polymerizing unlabelled septins is referred to as \"dark\" septin polymerization buffer (SPB).\nSeptin bundle imaging via fluorescence microscopy",
    "Prepare the 5x fluoSPB (Table 2) and a septin mix consisting of 90% dark septin and 10% msfGFP-septin at six times higher concentration than the desired final concentration in septin buffer + 1 mM DTT. A typical concentration for this assay is 300 nM, and, therefore, the concentration is 1,800 nM for this mix.\nPolymerize the septin by mixing, in this specific order, I-water (enough to top up to the final desired volume), 20% 5xfluoSPB (a final dilution of 1:5), 0.05 μM PCD, and 16.67% septin mix (a final dilution of 1:6). For 10 μL, mix 6.23 μL of I-water, 2 μL of 5xfluoSPB, 0.1 μL of PCD (with a stock of 5 μM), and 1.67 μL of septin mix. Incubate this mix for at least 30 min at room temperature.\nAdd the samples to an imaging chamber washed with fluoSPB (Table 2) and image the septin bundles. PLL-PEG-passivated flow channels, as described in previous research10,32, work well for this experiment.\nSeptin bundle imagining via negative stain transmission electron microscopy\n\t\nPrepare the 5x darkSPB (Table 2) and a septin mix consisting of 100% dark septin at six times higher concentration than the desired final concentration in septin buffer + 1 mM DTT. A typical concentration for this assay is 300 nM, and, therefore, the concentration is 1,800 nM for this mix.\nPolymerize the septin complexes by mixing, in this specific order, I-water (enough to top up to the final desired volume), 20% 5xdarkSPB, and 16.67% septin mix. For 5 μL, mix 3.16 μL of I-water, 1 μL of 5x darkSPB, and 0.83 μL of septin mix. Incubate this mix for at least 30 min at room temperature.",
    "Add 3-5 μL of sample to a glow-discharged electron microscopy grid and incubate for 1 min. Then, wash the grid 2x with darkSPB (Table 2) by absorbing the liquid with a filter paper and adding a drop of darkSPB buffer, wash 1x with I-water, incubate for ~30 s with 2% uranyl acetate, blot the stain, and air-dry the sample for a few minutes.\nImage the septin bundles at 120 kV and magnifications between 5,000x and 60,000x with a defocus of between 1-2 μm."
