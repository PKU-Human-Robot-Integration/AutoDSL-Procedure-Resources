    "Cell CultureMaintain PDE12-/- HEK293 cells in T75 flasks in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, at 37°C and 5% CO2. Cells should be ready for transfer to a T175 flask in ~2-3 days.Scale up by splitting every 2-3 days until the target cell mass is reached. At least 8 flasks with 30 ml cells per flask is recommended as a starting point for adapting to suspension culture.At 90% confluence, detach cells with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA for 10-15 min at 37°C, and monitor the cell rounding. Centrifuge at 200 × g to remove trypsin, then resuspend the pelleted cells 2-3 times in 10-20 ml Freestyle medium with 1% FBS to wash out old media.Resuspend the detached cells in 30-50 ml Freestyle media with 1% FBS, adjust cell density with media to around 0.5 × 106 cells/ml, and grow at 37°C, 8% CO2, 120 × g.Scale up by diluting and splitting with pre-warmed fresh Freestyle media with 1% FBS. Count cells using an automated cell counter and adjust cell concentration to 0.5 × 106 cells/ml.Observe and count the cells every other day, and proceed to split/dilute the cells if the cell density is above 1.5 × 106 cells/ml.The final cell density can range from 0.8 to 1.5 × 106 cells/ml, and the isolation of mitochondria requires at least 10 L as a starting point (Please see Notes for starting volume of wild-type).Harvest cells by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 7 min at 4°C. Decant the supernatant carefully and resuspend the pelleted cells quickly in pre-cooled PBS to wash out the media.Centrifuge the resuspended cells at 1,200 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Decant the supernatant carefully and weigh the pellet. Continue to isolate the mitochondria from harvested cells, or snap-freeze the cells in liquid nitrogen and store at -80°C.",
    "Mitochondria isolationPre-cool the Teflon/glass Dounce homogenizer O/N prior to use.Resuspend the pellet (e.g., 10 g) in 60 ml MIB buffer.Allow cells to swell by gently stirring in a 4°C cold room for 15 min.Add 20 ml SM4 buffer (1/3 of MIB buffer volume).Dounce homogenize the samples (> 60 up-and-down passes).Centrifuge the homogenized sample at 800 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Collect supernatant (Supernatant-1) through a Miracloth (or other cheese cloth with a typical pore size of ~22-25 µm). Keep the pellet.Resuspend the pellet in 20 ml MIBSM (3:1 MIB:SM) buffer, homogenize manually (~15 up-and-down passes), then centrifuge at 4°C, 800 × g for 15 min.Collect supernatant (Supernantant-2) through a Miracloth and combine with Supernatant-1 from B-6. Centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Collect supernatant.Centrifuge the supernatant from the previous step at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.Keep pellet, but carefully wash out loose pellet without disturbing the tight portion.Resuspend in 10 ml MIBSM buffer, add 100 U RNase-free DNase I per 10 g cells, rotate on a roller in a cold room for 20 min.Centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.Resuspend the pellet in ~2 ml SEM buffer and homogenize gently with a small Dounce homogenizer. Perform no more than five up-and-down passes.Prepare a 15-23-32-60% sucrose gradient in SW40 tubes. Place 1.5 ml of the 60% sucrose stock buffer into the Beckman Ultra-Clear centrifuge tube. Carefully overlay 4.5 ml of the 32% sucrose stock buffer. Repeat with 1.5 ml of the 23% sucrose stock buffer and then with 1.5 ml of the 15% sucrose stock buffer.Load resuspended crude mitochondrial sample from Step B13 on top of the 15% sucrose in the density gradient prepared in Step B14.",
    "Centrifuge in an SW40 rotor at 28, 000 × g for 1 h at 4°C.The intact mitochondria form a brown band at the 60%-32% sucrose interface. Carefully remove the sucrose from the top until reaching the mitochondrial band, then take the brown band with a pipette at the interface of 32% and 60% sucrose.Snap-freeze the purified mitochondria in liquid nitrogen and store at -80°C.Mitoribosome-Oxa1L purificationDefrost the frozen mitochondria on ice.Add 2 volumes of lysis buffer to mitochondria (e.g., Add 8 ml lysis buffer to 4 ml mitochondria). Mix immediately by inverting the tube several times.Homogenize with a small Teflon/glass Dounce homogenizer to assist lysis.Rotate on a roller in a cold room for 20 min to complete the lysis.Centrifuge the lysed material (approximately 9 ml) at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C to remove the insoluble material. Decant the supernatant carefully from the pellet and discard the pellet.Prepare the sucrose cushion in Ti70 (tube vol approx. 24 ml): underlay 7 ml 1 M (34%, w/v) Sucrose Cushion Buffer at the bottom of the tube.Layer approximately 17 ml lysed mitochondrial sample on the sucrose cushions carefully, resulting in a lysate:cushion ratio of 2.5:1.Centrifuge the sample at ~231,550 × g for 60 min at 4°C.Discard the supernatant and rinse the tubes sequentially with resuspension buffer to remove residual sucrose (without disturbing the pellet).Resuspend pellets in a total of 100 µl resuspension buffer.Measure mitoribosome absorption at A260.Load the entire sample onto a linear 15-30% sucrose gradient tube. Centrifuge in a TLS-55 rotor at 213, 626 × g for 60-90 min at 4°C.Fractionate the gradient, determine the optical density at A260, and pool the fraction corresponding to the nucleic acid peak together. The typical A260:A280 ratio of the peak is >1.6.",
    "Exchange the buffer if necessary and dilute the sample with at least 5-10 volumes of final buffer; concentration or dialysis are recommended. Calculate the final concentration using a NanoDrop and the conversion: 1 A260 = 0.1 mg/ml.Use the purified mitoribosome sample for subsequent experiments or snap-freeze in resuspension buffer and store at -80°C."
