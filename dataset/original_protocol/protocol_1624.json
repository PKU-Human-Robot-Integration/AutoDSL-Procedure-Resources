    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nConduct IncuCyte experiment\nTiming: Varies in function of length of starvation, but typically 2–3 days\nThe monitoring of turboGFP-LC3B signal in live cells upon starvation was performed using an IncuCyte system (https://www.sartorius.com/en/products/live-cell-imaging-analysis/live-cell-analysis-instruments[href=https://www.sartorius.com/en/products/live-cell-imaging-analysis/live-cell-analysis-instruments]). This live-imaging platform consists of a microscope residing in a standard tissue culture incubator maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2 that allows automated image acquisition and analysis through the IncuCyte software. This protocol was tested using IncuCyte FLR and ZOOM models but more recent versions should also be compatible. The main difference between FLR and ZOOM is that the latter has both green (Ex: 460 [440,480] nm; Em: 524 [504,544] nm) and red (Ex: 585 [565,605] nm; Em: 635 [625,705] nm) LEDs, whereas the FLR offers only the green fluorescence. Both have phase contrast imaging.\nImportantly, this protocol may be used to monitor autophagy using any high-throughput imaging platform (i.e., N Cell Analyzer [GE] or Cytation Multi-Mode Reader [BioTek/Agilent]) but some adjustments may be required depending on the system.\nDuring starvation experiments, DMEM high glucose supplemented with 2 μg/mL penicillin–streptomycin and 10% FBS was used as a control and cells were starved in starvation media (for example DMEM without glucose, DMEM without amino acids or Earle’s Balanced Salt Solution [EBSS], supplemented with 2 μg/mL penicillin–streptomycin and 10% dialyzed FBS).\nFBS was dialyzed at 4°C in 3,500  MW cut-off dialysis tubing against PBS for 6 h and then overnight to remove amino acids and glucose.\nFor more detailed starvation protocol, refer to (Nowosad et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) and (Nowosad et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nIn the current manuscript, starvation was performed using EBSS medium supplemented with 10% FBS and non-essential amino acids.\nSeed turboGFP-LC3B expressing cells into multi-well plates.\nTrypsinize cells, inactivate trypsin with serum-containing medium and count cells using a method of choice.",
    "Seed appropriate number of cells to obtain 50%–70% confluence the day of starvation (the exact density depends on the type and duration of treatment). MEFs were seeded at 12 000 cells per well in 24-well plates but the optimal number of cells should be determined for each cell types in a pilot experiment. Allow cells to adhere overnight in the incubator.\nNote: Seeding the cells at the right density and without cell clusters is crucial for the success of the experiment. Autophagy was shown to be affected by contact inhibition. Thus, particular attention should be paid to obtain the appropriate seeding density. See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for more information.\nStarve cells.\nRemove medium and wash cells twice with warm PBS followed by one wash with starvation medium. Add full (control) or starvation medium to the wells.\nBegin plate imaging with IncuCyte.\nPlace plate in available slot and ensure that plate is seated securely.\nOpen IncuCyte software and select the appropriate plate type and imaging pattern. Schedule scan every 2 or 4 h for 2–5 days (depending on the cell type and starvation medium), selecting phase and green fluorescence channels.\nComplete IncuCyte experiment.\nRemove plate from scan schedule in the IncuCyte software.\nRemove plate from the IncuCyte.\nGenerate processing definition\nTiming: 45–60 min\nCreating a \"processing definition\" aims to “train the software” using the selected images to determine the optimal settings for automated object detection in all images generated in the experiment. This step is required only the first time the experiment is performed. Once defined and saved in the software, the same workflow can be applied to subsequent experiments.\nNote: This step is specific for the Zoom software and is not present in the FLR version.\nNote: You can also generate a new processing definition for previously analyzed experiments.",
    "Add representative images to Image Collection. We recommend using at least 2–3 images for each condition representing different time points of the experiment.\nDefine parameters for object detection (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) for phase contrast and green fluorescence channels.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1186-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Processing definition for autophagy assay\nImages represent MEFs expressing turboGFP-LC3B with and without masks using parameters set up in processing definition. The merge channel shows overlap between the green mask (purple) and the phase mask (yellow). For phase channel analysis, the following parameters were applied: segmentation adjustment: 1.1; adjust size: −1 pixel; area: min 200 μm. For green channel analysis, the following parameters were used: Top-Hat segmentation; radius: 90 μm; threshold (GCU): 2; area: min 200 μm. Scale bars are 300 μm.\nDefine the parameters for the phase contrast channel.\nClick Preview Current and apply the Confluence Mask to visualize the preset values already present in the analysis software.\nRefine the parameters within the confluence mask:\nSet up Segmentation adjustment, which aims at adjusting the Background/Cells slider bar. We used a 1.1 value.\nClean up by adjusting size. This parameters allows to either enlarge (by choosing a positive value) or shrink (by using a negative value) the mask by a specific number of pixels. We set up −1, which means that the mask was reduced by 1 pixel.\nDefine minimal object area to filter out dead cells and debris (in the Zoom software, distance measurement can be made by clicking a ruler icon on the right side of the image). In our analysis, we excluded objects smaller than 200 μm2.\nPreview all the images. If you are satisfied with the parameters, proceed to the processing definition of the green channel.\nDefine the Analysis Parameters for the green Channel.",
    "Define the mode of object segmentation by selecting top-hat processing, which allows subtracting the local background from brightly fluorescent objects within a given radius\nSet up a fluorescence threshold. Increasing the threshold will eliminate masking of background while decreasing the threshold will include dimmer objects. We used a threshold of 2 GCU.\nAdjust edge sensitivity to optimize the segmentation mask for adjacent objects. As we will be extracting confluence and not the number or area of objects, there is no need to switch the Edge Split on.\nAs above, define minimal object area to filter out dead cells and debris. In our analysis, we excluded objects smaller than 200 μm2.\nPreview all images to control the segmentation mask. If you are satisfied with the parameters, launch the analysis.\nExtracting and analyzing data\nThis protocol explains how to exploit and further analyze data generated with the IncuCyte software.\nTiming: 1–3 h (depending on the number of wells and conditions)\nExtract raw counts from IncuCyte software.\nExport the results for confluence (percent) calculations for phase contrast and green channels.\nCopy raw data to Excel file and calculate the ratio of the percentage of confluence in the green channel by the confluence in the phase contrast channel using the following formula:\nGreen confluence (percent)/Phase contrast confluence (percent)\nAlternatives: Instead of normalizing data with phase confluence, you can label cell nuclei using an appropriate red probe (e.g. IncuCyte® Nuclight Rapid Red Dye) and normalize the number of fluorescent green objects [in this case edge split should be turned on to precisely determine the number of objects] by the number of nuclei (only applicable in IncuCyte models equipped with more than one fluorescence channel).\nNormalize the obtained values with that of the first scan (time 0 h).",
    "Optional: Import your data into graphing software to create graphs. We used GraphPad Prism for statistical analysis and data visualization but this step may also be performed in Excel.\nGenerate a curve representing the levels of green fluorescence normalized by the number of cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). In the example shown Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], cells were starved in EBSS supplemented with 10% serum and non-essential amino acids for the indicated times. Upon starvation, there is a progressive decrease of turboGFP-LC3B fluorescence (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). A similar observation is made by immunoblotting endogenous LC3B (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) at various times following starvation, indicating that turboGFP-LC3B behaves similarly to the endogenous protein in starvation conditions.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1186-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Quantification of autophagy in turboGFP-LC3B MEFs\n(A) turboGFP-LC3B MEFs were kept either in full or starvation medium (EBSS supplemented with 10% serum and non-essential amino acids) and fluorescent object confluence was measured every 2 h for 72 h. Fluorescent object confluence results were divided by phase confluence results at the same time point and normalized with the first scan (0 h).\n(B) Immunoblot of LC3B levels in MEFs starved for the indicated times as in (A). Actin was used as loading control."
