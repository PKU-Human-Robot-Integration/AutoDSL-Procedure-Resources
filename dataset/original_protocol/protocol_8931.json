    "All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the institutional guidelines of the DKFZ.\nCaution: In order to prevent RNAse contamination of samples, take basic precautions for avoiding RNAse contamination and prepare all buffers with DEPC-treated water.\n1. Preparation of Sucrose Gradients\nPrepare 17.5, 25.6, 33.8, 41.9 and 50% sucrose solutions (see Table 1). Start preparing gradients by slowly adding 2 ml of 50% sucrose solution to the bottom of a polyallomer ultracentrifuge tube. Freeze the layer by placing tubes for 20 min at -80 °C.\nAdd the subsequent layers at decreasing sucrose percentages with freezing steps in between, ending up to 17.5% sucrose. Keep gradients on ice during addition of sucrose solutions in order to prevent thawing of underlying layers.\nPrepare sucrose gradients freshly one day before use and keep at 4 °C. Alternatively, prepare gradients in advance, store at -80 °C and thaw at 4 °C the night before the experiment.\n2. Tissue Preparation (Spinal Cord and/or Brain)\nAnesthetize mouse by an overdose of Xylazin and Ketamin in NaCl and transcardially perfuse with 20 ml of Hank's balanced salts solution (HBSS) containing 200 µg/ml CHX which immobilizes ribosomes on associated transcripts. Confirm proper anesthetization by non-responsiveness to toe pinches.\nExtract tissue rapidly. Open the cranium dorsally and extract the brain. Perform laminectomy of the entire thoracic and lumbar vertebral column and extract the spinal cord. Use whole brain (~400 mg) or a 4 cm piece of spinal cord (~90 mg), respectively.\nTransfer tissue into ice cold homogenization buffer A (see Table 1) (spinal cord: 1 ml; brain: 4 ml) and dice into small pieces with a clean scalpel to allow increased uptake of cycloheximide. Perform all further steps on ice.",
    "Incubate for 15 min and homogenize tissue mechanically using a Dounce homogenizer. Carefully controlled homogenization is necessary to ensure that nuclei remain intact. Treat all samples exactly the same way to ensure comparability. Note: for brain tissue: Disrupt tissue by 5 strokes with a tightly fitting pestle. For spinal cord tissue: disrupt by 5 strokes with a loosely fitting pestle, followed by 5 further strokes with a tightly fitting pestle.\nTake aliquots (400 µl for brain and 200 µl for spinal cord), flash freeze and store at -80 °C for total RNA isolation.\nRemove nuclei and undisrupted cell and tissue fragments by centrifugation at 500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Low speed centrifugation prevents loss of ribosomes.\nLyse membrane fragments in the nuclei free supernatant for 30 min by adding NP-40 and sodium deoxycholate detergents (each to a final concentration of 1%).\n3. Myelin Flotation\nThis step removes fatty components from the sample which will otherwise mask the signal in the polyribosome profile. First, pre-chill ultracentrifuge buckets and rotor at 4 °C and prepare 2 M, 1.1 M and 0.9 M sucrose solutions (see Table 1).\nMix lysate with an 1.22 volumes of 2 M sucrose solution and transfer into a polyethylene ultracentrifuge tube. Fill up all tubes to equal volume of 10 ml with 1.1 M sucrose solution, thereafter overlay it carefully with 0.9 M sucrose solution.\nPlace the ultracentrifuge tubes into pre-chilled ultracentrifuge buckets. Centrifuge for 3 hr at 100,000 x g at 4 °C. During this process ribosomes become deposited in the pellet whereas fatty components float up and remain in the supernatant.\n4. Sucrose Gradient Fractionation",
    "Remove supernatant and dissolve pellet in homogenization buffer B (see Table 1). Measure the absorbance at 260 nm for each sample using a Nanodrop or equivalent apparatus and normalize amounts to load according to the absorbance value.\nPlace sucrose gradients (preparation is described in a previous section) into the pre-chilled ultracentrifuge buckets. Layer samples carefully on top of the gradient. Add one blank sucrose gradient as technical control.\nAdjust the weight of each bucket with homogenization buffer. Centrifuge samples for 1.5 hr at 285,000 x g at 4 °C.\nStart preparing the Isco fractionator 30 min before the end of centrifugation. If another model of fractionator is used, follow the manufacturer's protocol.\n\t\nSet the appropriate sensitivity (0.2 AUFS for brain or 0.05 AUFS for spinal cord) for the UV lamp and switch it on for warming up. Assemble the tube piercer, connect it via the rolling pump to 60% sucrose solution through the tube piercer.\nTest the setup by pumping sucrose (flow rate: 1 ml/min), in particular make sure there is no leaks in the tubings which will introduce bubbles into the gradient.\nBlank background absorption by manually pumping gradient buffer into the UV detector and correcting the baseline.\nCarefully remove the ultracentrifuge buckets containing the sucrose gradients with sedimented samples from the rotor and place them on ice. Avoid any bumping of gradients to prevent loss of resolution.\nRun gradients on the fractionator. Run empty gradients first to assess background absorption and ensure proper technical setup.\n\t\nAttach gradient to the UV detector and pierce the bottom of the tube with the tube piercer. Start the pumping of 60% sucrose, which will displace the gradient with sedimented samples upwards through the UV detector and into the drop dispenser.",
    "The absorbance at 260 nm is documented to generate the absorption profile for the sample, with peaks indicating the sedimentation of mRNAs associated with ribosomal subunits, monosomes, and subsequently increasing number of ribosomes.\nCollect samples into 20 fractions via the drop dispenser (600 µl each, in 2 ml tubes).\n5. RNA Isolation from Individual Fractions\nAdd 10% SDS to a final concentration of 1% to individual fractions and mix well in order to unfold proteins and dissociate ribosomes. At this point samples can be frozen at -80 °C. Depending on the question to be addressed, fractions can be pooled according to the absorbance profile.\nIsolate RNA with acidic phenol/chloroform extraction, which also removes contaminating traces of DNA.\n\t\nAdd one volume of acidic phenol/chloroform (prewarmed to RT) to each sample, heat for 10 min at 65 °C and release pressure under the fume hood afterwards.\nCentrifuge samples for 20 min at 17,000 x g at RT. Carefully transfer aqueous phase to a new 1.5 ml tube. Be aware of phase inversion in denser sucrose fractions, where the aqueous phase might be at the bottom after centrifugation.\nAdd one volume of isopropanol, 1/9 volume sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 1 µl GlycoBlue to each sample in order to precipitate RNA. Keep samples at least 1 hr at -80 °C.\nCentrifuge for 30 min at 17,000 x g and 4 °C. GlycoBlue provides visualization of the pellet. Remove supernatant, wash pellet once with ice cold 80% ethanol and air dry pellet. Dissolve pellet in RNAse free water.\nQuantify amount of RNA by Nanodrop and analyze RNA integrity by a Bioanalyzer chip. RNA which is obtained by the presented protocol is suitable for all state of the art high throughput assays including microarray and deep sequencing."
