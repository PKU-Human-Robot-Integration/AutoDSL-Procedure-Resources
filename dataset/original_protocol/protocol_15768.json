    "The procedures involving animal use were conducted following local and national guidelines and approved by the corresponding Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Institute of Cellular Physiology IACUC protocol VLH151-19). Drd1-Cre transgenic male mice27, 35-40 days postnatal with C57BL/6 background were used in the current protocol. Mice were kept under the following conditions: temperature 22±1 °C; humidity 55%; light schedule 12/12 h with lights off at 7 p.m. and were weaned at postnatal day 21. Weaned pups were housed in same-sex groups of 2-5. Animals were housed in static housing with micro-barrier tops. Bedding consisted of sterile aspen shavings. Rodent pellets and RO-purified water were provided ad libitum, except when noted.\n1. Surgical procedures\nPrepare an LED cannula at the desired length according to the dorsoventral coordinates of the structure of interest (ideally 0.5 mm longer to account for the thickness of the skull, for the dorsolateral striatum 3.5 mm) (Figure 1).\n\t\nCut the glass fiber to a length longer than the final desired size, grind the fiber tip to the target length with rough sandpaper, and finally, polish the fiber tip with fine sandpaper.\n\t\tNOTE: LED cannula is a glass optical fiber of 250 µm diameter attached to an infrared receiver (see Table of Materials).\nPull glass pipettes (1.14 mm outer diameter, 0.53 mm inner diameter, and 3.5 in length) for the nano-injector with a horizontal puller (see Table of Materials) and store them for later. Program the puller in one loop to get a 15-20 µm tip diameter with a long gradual slope taper (4-5 mm).\nPrepare the surgery area by thoroughly disinfecting the stereotaxic apparatus, hood, micro-injector (see Table of Materials), and surrounding surfaces with 70% ethanol.",
    "NOTE: A mouse stereotaxic apparatus is essential to inject Adeno Associated Virus (AAVs) precisely and place the LED cannula in the region of interest.\nWear the appropriate personal protective equipment for the procedure, including a clean lab coat or disposable surgical gown, sterile gloves, face mask, and disposable head cap.\nPlace the necessary equipment close to the surgery area, such as sterile surgical tools, cotton tips, solutions, micropipette, pipette tips, capillaries, micro-fill with mineral oil, and marker.\nFill a pipette for microinjections with mineral oil and place it in the micro-injector. Make sure that the micro-injector is working correctly by ejecting some mineral oil.\n\tNOTE: All instruments used during the surgery should be autoclaved and sterile. Aseptic technique should be used.\nAnesthetize animals with gaseous isoflurane 4-5% to induce anesthesia and 1.2% throughout the surgery with 0.5-1 L/min pure oxygen. The surgery begins only after the animal has reached a point of deep anesthesia, assessed by the absence of paw withdrawal after a slight pinch.\n\t\nContinuously monitor the breathing rate and temperature of the animal. Maintain the body temperature by a heating pad set at 34 °C.\nApply an ophthalmic ointment. Remove hair from the scalp with a trimer and hair removal cream. Wipe the scalp with cotton swabs having 8% povidone-iodine (see Table of Materials) and 70% ethanol alternated three times each.\nPlace the mouse in the stereotaxic apparatus and secure the head, ensuring that the skull is leveled in the mediolateral and anterior-posterior axes.\nMake a 1 cm incision with a scalpel through the scalp at the level of the eyes along the sagittal axis. Retract the skin to expose the skull and clean the periosteum with cotton swabs.",
    "Clean the cranium surface with saline solution and sterile cotton swabs. Resolve any bleeding at the surface using sterile absorbent eye spears (see Table of Materials) or similar sterile absorbent material.\nApply a drop of 2.5% hydrogen peroxide with a cotton swab and let it act for a few seconds to make the skull sutures visible and have a better reference. After a few seconds, clean thoroughly with a clean cotton swab.\nWith the glass pipette (15 µm final tip diameter), locate bregma and lambda to check that the skull is leveled in the anterior-posterior axis.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to have a stereoscopic microscope or USB microscope to see the tip of the glass pipette. In case it is needed, adjust the height of the mouth holder to level the skull.\nMove the capillary toward the selected anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) coordinates (dorsolateral striatum AP 1.2 mm, ML 2.28 mm). Paint a reference point in the scalp above the selected coordinates with a sterile marker.\nIn the reference point, perform an ~1 mm diameter craniotomy applying gentle pressure to the skull with a sterile rotary tool or dental drill at a low to medium speed with a small round dental drill bit (see Table of Materials).\nLoad the capillary with 300-400 nL of Cre-dependent adeno-associated virus (AAV) such as AAV1-dflox-hChR-2-mCherry to express Channelrhodopsin or an AAV to express only the reporter protein (e.g., mCherry) as a control in the region of interest (see Table of Materials). Check that the tip is not clogged, then introduce the glass pipette in the brain at the desired dorso-ventral (DV) coordinates (dorsolateral striatum DV -3.35 mm).",
    "Inject 200 nL using an automatic injector at a rate of 23 nL/s. Wait for 10 min after finishing the injection, withdraw the glass pipette slowly to avoid spillage.\n\t\tNOTE: It is possible to use a 30 G needle to inject with the appropriate micro-injector.\nClean and dry any residues with cotton swabs.\nAttach the sterile glass LED cannula to the stereotaxic arm and calibrate the coordinates using bregma as a reference. Insert the cannula very slowly (300 µm/min) to avoid tissue damage and place it 100 µm above the injection site.\nOnce the LED cannula is in place, add a drop (100 µL) of tissue adhesive at the edge of the craniotomy.\nPrepare dental cement mixture (see Table of Materials) following the manufacturer's instructions to fix the fiber to the skull.\n\tNOTE: Briefly, use a chilled porcelain dish to have more working time before cement sets. Add 2 scoops of resin clear powder to the porcelain dish, add 4 drops of quick base and 1 drop of catalyst, then mix well. The powder/liquid ratio can be adjusted if a thinner or thicker viscosity is needed.\nUsing a sterile brush, apply the dental cement mixture around the cannula connector little by little, building layers until the skull is covered and the connector is securely attached to the skull, leaving the pins completely free. Avoid getting dental cement on the skin of the mouse.\nAllow drying completely.\nClose the skin around the implant using tissue adhesive (see Table of Materials).",
    "Place the mouse in a recovery cage over a heating pad at 33° C. Monitor for the presence of one or more of the following signs of pain/discomfort: 1) Hunched up, lack or reduction of motor activity, 2) Failure to groom reflected in a unkept dirty coat, 3) Excessive licking or scratching, redness in the incision site, 4) aggressive behavior, 5) anorexia or dehydration, and 6) Lack of nest formation.\n\tNOTE: Keep the mouse individually caged during all the procedures to avoid implant detaching. In case of detachment of the cannula, perform euthanasia by injecting 150 mg/kg of sodium pentobarbital followed by decapitation after deep anesthesia is reached.\nInject subcutaneously (SC) meloxicam 1 mg/kg once daily for three days post-surgery to provide analgesia.\nWait at least 7 days for complete recovery and 14 days for opsin expression before further procedures.\n\tNOTE: Perform a postoperative follow-up every 12 hours for three days, then check animals every day until the day of euthanasia at the end of the experiment.\n2. Reach-to-grasp training\nOn day 7 post-surgery, start the food deprivation protocol28. Weigh mice for three consecutive days to determine their average ad libitum body weight. Then, schedule food restrictions so that the animals receive enough nutrients to maintain approximately 90% and not less than 85% of body weight.\n\tNOTE: This is achieved by providing 2.5-3 g of food daily. Monitor animals' weight daily and score for overall well-being observing animals' behavior and appearance, for example, coat and eyes appearance. Use the body condition scoring system from Reference29.\nDuring the pre-training, training, and testing periods, provide each mouse with 20 pellets (20 mg of dustless chocolate-flavored pellets) daily (see Table of Materials) (eaten during the task or after) besides the standard food pellets.",
    "Three days before habituation, scatter 0.4 g/animal/day 20 mg of dustless chocolate-flavored pellets in their home cages, so mice get acquainted with the pellets that serve as a reward during the reach-to-grasp task.\nHabituate mice by placing them 10 min in the testing chamber one day before pre-training with pellets scattered on the chamber floor (Figure 1A).\nAllow food daily after training and testing. Keep a similar schedule every day.\nOn the first day of pre-training, place the mice in the reach-to-grasp chamber and observe from the front. Place the pellets in front of the chamber close to the opening so that they start consuming the pellets. At this stage, mice are allowed to grab the pellets in any form.\nOn day two of pre-training, place the pellets further and further from the opening until getting them to the indentation (1 cm from the opening) so mice can shape their reach-to-grasp movement (Figure 1C).\nTrain mice to run to the rear of the cage and return to the cage opening to receive the next food pellet as a strategy to individualize trials.\n\tNOTE: This can be achieved by waiting until the mouse is in the rear of the cage before placing a pellet in the indentation for each trial.\nPlace pellets to be grasped by either their right or left paw.\n\tNOTE: Mice start using preferentially one paw to grasp, which will be used the following days of training and testing.",
    "Train animals for 6 days in daily sessions lasting 20 trials or until a maximum of 10 min elapse. From day 2 of training, put the mock receiver (dimensions 12 x 18 x 7 mm, 1 g, see Table of Materials), so mice get habituated to the weight while performing the task (Figure 1B). Each day score the number of hit and missed trials.\nRecord behavior with a regular camera and capture 30-60 frames/s from the front of the chamber. Additionally, one can place a mirror under the training chamber at a 45° angle to monitor the animals' posture (Figure 1D,E).\nFor post-hoc kinematic analysis (Figure 2), mount a high-speed camera (see Table of Materials) at an angle of 45° to record from the side of the cage. If a 3D analysis is required, place a second high-speed camera to record at a 35° angle from the front of the chamber; both cameras should be placed in the right or left side of the cage depending on animals' sidedness and should capture at the same frame rate and be synchronized7 (Figure 3D,E).\nSet the high-speed cameras to 100 frames/s with a resolution of 376 x 252 pixels or more if possible. Place white Styrofoam walls behind the sides and back of the chamber to reduce background and increase contrast (Figure 1E).\nOn test day, replace the mock unit with an infrared receiver for wireless optogenetic stimulation (Figure 1B,C).\nWhen mice start reaching, turn the LED cannula manually with the remote controller to have a continuous stimulation for the time the behavior is performed and for no longer than 2 s. Programming an automatic stimulation paradigm is preferable. The stimulation device triggers an LED of 470 nm (blue light) with intensity at the tip of 1.0 mW/mm2.",
    "Collect the videos for further examination, including scoring and kinematic analysis.\n3. Post-hoc histological confirmation\nUpon completion of an experiment, confirm viral expression and LED cannula placement. Anesthetize the animal with a cocktail of ketamine 100 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg. Once the mouse presents signs of deep anesthesia (step 1.7), perfuse with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% PFA.\nRemove implanted cannula carefully by firmly grasping the connector with forceps and pulling up gently.\nExtract and post-fix the brain for 24 h in 4% PFA23.\nPerform 3-10 min washes with PBS.\nCut the brain in 50 µm sections using a microtome (see Table of Materials).\nMount the sections in slides with hard-set mounting media with DAPI to stain nuclei and cover slides.\nAfter drying, observe the sections under the confocal microscope and verify the implanted cannula location and expression of Ch2R fused with any fluorescent protein.\nSubscription Required.
