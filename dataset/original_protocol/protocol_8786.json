    "Ensure that each patient is reviewed for suitability for the research study, and appropriate patients must be consented for participation in the study according to local IRB procedures.\n1. Patient Selection for SEEG and Research\nPatient Selection for SEEG\n\tNote: Epilepsy patients must be clinically assessed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of epileptologists, neuropsychologists and neurosurgeons.\n\t\nEnsure that the patient has medically refractory focal epilepsy, defined as failure to respond to at least 2 adequate trials of anti-epileptic medications.\nEnsure that non-invasive techniques have failed to localize the epileptogenic foci.\nConfirm with multidisciplinary team that patient is not suitable for investigation only with subdural grid electrodes.\nConfirm with multidisciplinary team that there is clinical suspicion of a deep seizure onset zone.\nPatient selection for research task\n\t\nEnsure that subject is between the ages of 13 and 65 years.\nObtain consent or assent (together with parental consent if below the age of 18 years) from the patient.\nEnsure that subjects are able to attend to the task and cooperate with the testing.\n2. Preparation and Implantation Technique\nPerform a volumetric T2 and contrast enhanced volumetric T1 MRI preoperatively and transfer the images to the stereotactic navigation software, according to manufacturer’s protocol.\n\t\nPlan the depth electrode targets based on the MRI and clinical suspicion of seizure foci.\n\t\tNote: The examples provided are based on the BrainLab navigation software and are thus specific to this system. However, any stereotactic navigation software can be used to plan depth electrode trajectories and placement.\nDefine the anatomical region of interest as the target point within the “Stereotactic Planning” function in the stereotactic navigation software.",
    "For example, use dACC as the target of interest. To define its trajectory, press “New Trajectory,” then press “target” and click on the dACC. Center the target in the middle of dACC by examining dACC in all 3 planes (axial, coronal and sagittal) and clicking on the middle of dACC in each plane.\n\t\t\nDefine the entry point on the scalp within the “Stereotactic Planning” function in the stereotactic navigation software.\nFor example, choose a point on the scalp that appears to be the shortest path to the dACC. Press “entry” and choose the point on the scalp to make the entry point.\nClick and drag the “target” and “entry” points to modify the defined trajectory to avoid cortical and subcortical vascular structures as well as any potential eloquent cerebral regions.\nRepeat for all planned depth electrode targets (Figure 1).\nAdmit the patient on the morning of the surgery, bring to the operating room, and induce under general anesthesia26,27.\nAttach a Cosman-Roberts-Wells (CRW) stereotactic headframe to the patient’s head with skull screws.\nObtain a volumetric CT with the headframe in place.\nLoad the volumetric CT and MRI images into the stereotactic navigation software via the “Load and Import” function.\nClick on the “Localization” function within the stereotactic navigation software.\nLocalize the CRW headframe by clicking on all of the images defined by the stereotactic navigation software as containing the headframe and then pushing the “Assign localizer” button.\nClick on the “AC/PC Localization” function within the stereotactic navigation software.\nIdentify the anterior and posterior commissures based on their anatomical location.\nDesignate the anterior and posterior commissures via the “Set AC/PC system” function within the stereotactic navigation software.\nClick on the “Image Fusion” function within the stereotactic navigation software.",
    "Merge the CT images with the MRI images in the stereotactic navigation software28,29. Click on the paired volumetric CT and MRI images underneath the “Fusion” tab and then click “Auto Fusion”.\n\t\tNote: This places the MRI within the stereotactic frame coordinates.\nClick on the “Stereotactic Planning” function within the stereotactic navigation software and confirm the planned trajectories from steps 2.1.2 - 2.1.6.\nChoose the volumetric CT as the stereotactic reference under the “Stereotactic Functions” tab.\nClick the “print” icon in the vertical column of icons to print the final stereotactic coordinates for each depth electrode trajectory 30,31.\nImplantation technique\n\t\nReturn the patient to the operating room following the CT scan.\nPrepare and drape the surgical field using routine sterile methods32,33.\nEnsure that a fluoroscope is in the operating room and draped along with the rest of the surgical field.\nUsing the printed stereotactic coordinates from step 2.1.20, set the coordinates for the first depth electrode on the headframe.\n\t\tNote: The stereotactic coordinates are given in 3 planes: lateral (x), vertical (y) and anterior-posterior (z). For example, the printed coordinates for a target in the right dACC are +48.2 mm A-P, 6.6 mm Lateral and +2.2 mm Vertical. The headframe is then set to those coordinates accordingly.\nExtend the guideblock down to the skin and mark the location of the burr hole on the scalp with a marking pen. Fix the guideblock in place based on the stereotactic coordinates and as such, no landmarks are necessary to mark the incision.\nInject 2 - 3 ml of 0.5% bupivicaine in a 1:100,000 dilution of epinephrine into the marked incision.\nMake a nick in the scalp with a scalpel down to the skull into the marked incision.",
    "Cauterize the dermis and deep tissue using monopolar cautery directed with a coated obturator in order to minimize any bleeding from vessels in the skin or subcutaneous tissue.\nDrill a burr hole using a 2.1 mm twist drill bit in the middle of the incision.\nOpen the dura with a rigid obturator probe. Screw an anchor bolt into the skull. Place a pre-measured stylet probe through the anchor bolt to make a track for the electrode.\nCarefully advance the electrode to the pre-calculated depth. Tighten the anchor bolt cap down to secure the electrode.\nRepeat this process for all of the depth electrodes.\nPlace the fluoroscope underneath and surrounding the patient’s head in both AP and lateral planes to obtain fluoroscopic images to ensure adequate placement trajectories of all electrodes.\nConnect the electrodes to the clinical EEG system to verify appropriate impedances.\nWake the patient from anesthesia and transport to the recovery room, and subsequently to the EMU.\nIn the EMU, monitor the patient via closed circuit monitoring for clinical seizures and via ECoG for electrographic evidence of seizures.\n3. Behavioral Task and Data Acquisition\nBehavioral task\n\t\nOpen behavioral software on computer devoted solely to running the behavioral software.\n\t\tNote: The instructions provided are based on MonkeyLogic, a MATLAB toolbox designed for the presentation and execution of temporally precise psychophysical tasks34,35 and are thus specific to that behavioral software platform. This program is run on Matlab version 2010a and requires the “Data Acquisition Toolbox.” However, any behavioral software platform capable of presenting visual stimuli and recording electrophysiological data could be used.\nSet the conditions file designed to run the MSIT task to include all four trial types of equal frequency.",
    "Note: The MSIT task consists of presenting the subject with a cue of three numbers between 0 and 3, where two of the numbers, the ‘distractors’, are the same and one number, the ‘target’, is different.\n\t\t\nInstruct the subject to identify the ‘target’ by pressing the corresponding button on a button box. If ‘1’ is the target, the left button is the correct choice. If ‘2’, the middle button, and if ‘3’, the right button. ‘0’ does not correspond to a possible button (Figure 2).\nPress the “Set conditions” button and choose the desired conditions file set in the prior step.\n\t\tNote: There are two types of cognitive interference that induce conflict during the decision making process. Flanker interference trials occur when the distractors are possible (1, 2, or 3, rather than 0) button choices (e.g., 121), while spatial interference trials occur when the target number’s spatial location differs from the response location (e.g., 200, in which the middle button is the correct response, despite the fact that the target number is in the left position). There are four trial types based on the presence or absence of these two interference types.\nTest the behavioral display monitor by clicking “Test” in the display box. The display monitor should show the test visual stimulus for 2 - 3 sec.\nConnect the subject interface device (button box) to the analog inputs on the data acquisition board on the computer devoted to recording the electrophysiological data via three standard BNC cables.\nConnect the button box to a power source.",
    "Connect the data acquisition board to the 512-channel neural signal processor via a ribbon cable split into 9 ribbons. 8 of the ribbons are connected to ports 0 - 7 on the digital I/O portion of the data acquisition board while the 9th ribbon is connected to port 0 on the digital PFI portion of the data acquisition board.\n\t\tNote: The ribbons send 8-bit digital markers (ports 0 - 7, digital I/O) and a strobe pulse (port 0, digital PFI), to the neural signal processor.\nSet the desired sampling rate in the neural signal processor software.\n\t\t\nIn this example, set the desired sampling rate to 50,000 samples per second, alias and down-sample online to 1,000 samples per second. Adjust the sample rate to fit the specific goals of the task. Sub-millisecond precision timing requires an extremely high sampling rate.\nConnect the amplifier to the neural signal processor via fiber optic cable.\nConnect the neural signal processor to the data streamer and the optical PCI card in the neural data acquisition computer via fiber optic cable.\nData acquisition\n\t\nUse the research rig for EMU electrophysiology containing a 512-channel neural signal processor for processing and filtering digitized, pre-amplified electrical signals from the depth electrodes.\n\t\tNote: While there are 512 channels for processing, in practice, there are never more than 15 - 20 electrodes placed for clinical purposes. Therefore, we recommend recording from as many electrodes as feasible as data size and spatial resolution is never an issue.\nTransport the rig to the patient’s room, place the behavioral monitor in front of the patient on a portable table and connect to the behavioral control computer running the behavioral software using a standard DVI cable.",
    "Place the recording rig behind or to the side of the patient’s bed in order to remain as unobtrusive as possible.\nConnect the research system to the splitter box that separates the research recording from the clinical system.\nControl recording parameters using the neural signal processor software34,35.\n\t\tNote: This system enables sub-millisecond control over behavioral events34,35. Synchronization between neural and behavioral data can be accomplished with either analog pulses coding for task events or digital markers. Both signals can be sent from either the digital or analog outputs on the data acquisition board to the analog or digital inputs on the neural signal processor.\nHand the patient the subject interface device (button box) and give task instructions.\nClick “Run” to run the task.\nAllow the patient to complete 2 blocks of 150 trials each.\n4. Data Analysis\nOpen software package that allows for visualization of electrophysiological data.\n\tNote: The instructions provided below are specific to Matlab version 2010a but any software that allows for visualization and manipulation of electrophysiological data can be used.\nOpen .edf file containing raw electrophysiological data from the trial session.\nVisualize SEEG signal from the session to ensure there is no visible artifact such as epileptiform discharges or movement artifact (Figure 3A).\nOverlay the timing pulses from the behavioral task onto the raw LFP trace (Figure 3B) to illustrate how analog pulses can delineate trial structure.\nUsing the timing pulses, align the SEEG trace to cue presentation for each trial (Figure 3C).\nRemove outliers (>4 standard deviations) and artifact traces (Figure 3D).\nSave all aligned trials in a matrix for further analyses (20 trials shown stacked in Figure 3E).",
    "Average LFP activity across trials to reduce effect of noise, artifact, or EEG activity not related to the presented stimuli, and to increase the signal of interest (Figure 3F).\nCreate the raw, trial-averaged spectrogram using multi-tapered spectral analysis36-38.\n\tNote: Time-frequency analysis can be used in order to investigate the specific spectro-temporal dynamics across single or multiple trials. This method enables the investigation of neuronal oscillations at different frequencies over time.\nPad the signal from each trial with zeroes to the next largest power of 2 to avoid edge effects.\nApply a 800 ms sliding window with 5 leading tapers and a time-bandwidth product of 9 every 10 ms through the duration of the signal to create the spectrogram (Figure 4A).\nMultiply the log of the spectrogram by 10 and normalize to display higher frequency information.\n\tNote: Spectrograms can be normalized by a theoretical frequency distribution (i.e., each frequency value raised to the negative 2nd power)(Figure 4B), the mean spectrum of some baseline activity (Figure 4C), or by dividing by the mean and subtracting the standard deviation of the values in each frequency band (Figure 4D). This procedure allows for the examination of specific frequency bands in both raw and normalized forms over time for changes specific to the task. For example, high gamma band activation (70 - 150 Hz), which is shown in Figure 3E, is thought to reflect local excitatory activity of the local neuronal population surrounding the electrode39,40.\nSubscription Required.
