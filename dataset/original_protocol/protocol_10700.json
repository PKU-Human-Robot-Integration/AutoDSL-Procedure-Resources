    "1. Prepare the Upper and Lower Inserts for Cell Growth by Collagen Coating\nCalculate the number of inserts needed for the experiment. Place each insert in a separate sterile Petri dish (35 x 10 mm) and sterilize by irradiation (11 Gy).\nPrepare the collagen solution for coating of membranes: 50 μg/ml, 154 μl per insert (insert surface area 1.54 cm2).\nPlace several drops (~20 μl per drop) of collagen solution in a circle on the surface of the insert membrane (do not let the pipette tip touch the surface) and then carefully add the rest of the aliquot to form one large drop on the membrane surface. Ensure that the collagen solution remains hemispherical and does not drain from the membrane surface.\nCover the Petri dish with a lid and incubate for 1 hr at room temperature on a flat surface.\nAspirate the collagen solution and wash the membrane once by covering with 160 μl PBS.\nAspirate the PBS and replace the lid. If using the same day, place the Petri dish in a dry place at room temperature. Otherwise, place the dish at 4 °C and use the insert within 7 days.\n2. Culture Endothelial Cells on the Upper Inserts\nPrepare EC suspension in desired culture medium. Ensure that the cell viability is >98% and use immediately.\nNote: For human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC), 4 x 105 cells in 160 μl per insert is used.",
    "Take the Petri dishes with collagen-coated inserts prepared in section 1; do not remove the inserts from the dishes. Place several small drops of the cell suspension (approximately 20 μl per drop) in a circle on the surface of the collagen-coated membrane (do not let the pipette tip touch the surface) and then carefully add the rest of the cell suspension to form one large drop. Ensure that the cell suspension remains hemispherical and does not drain from the membrane surface.\nReplace the lids and carefully place the dishes in a 5% CO2 cell culture incubator and incubate (without shaking) at 37 °C for 30 min to allow the cells to attach to the membrane.\nGently add 5 ml of culture medium to each Petri dish ensuring that the insert remains on the bottom of the dish and is completely covered by the medium. Replace the lids and carefully put the dishes back in the incubator. Culture the cells at 37 °C overnight.\nUse the same approach to prepare the second (optional) lower insert with cells representing the local microenvironment, which will be placed below the insert containing the EC layer.\nNote: if the lower inserts are included in the experiments, the upper and lower inserts are first connected to each other before placing the inserts into the 3D device (Figure 4B).\n3. Assemble the 3D Flow Chamber Device\nScrew together the upper and lower plates, connect the plates to the gas exchange unit using tubing, place the assembled device into a clean plastic bag, and sterilize the bag and contents by irradiation (11 Gy).\nRemove a tray-shelf from the cell culture incubator, place into a sterile tissue culture hood, spray with 70% ethanol, wipe off, and then cover the tray with a large sterile napkin.",
    "Place the irradiated plastic bag into the hood, remove the device from the bag and place on the sterile incubator tray. Connect the device to the peristaltic pump with the tubing provided. Program the pump for an optimal speed of 0.2 ml/min.\t\nNote: To connect the pump with the electrical socket, extrude the electrical cord through the hole in the backside of the incubator. Use robber plug around the cord to assure that the hole is airtight.\nPlace 5 - 7 ml of desired culture medium into a sterile 15 ml tube (for the \"inlet\").\n4. Prime the 3D Flow Chamber Device\nDisconnect the inlet tubing from the outlet by pulling the metal needle from the tubing (use small sterile napkins to maintain sterility of the tubing). Use the metal needle connected to the tubing as an \"inlet\" and the disconnected end of tubing as an \"outlet\". Place the metal needle inlet into the 15 ml tube with the media; place the outlet into the empty 15 ml tube.\nTurn on the pump so the flow is counterclockwise and set the flow rate at 0.2 ml/min. Allow the negative pressure to draw the medium from the 15 ml inlet tube into the tubing and stop the pump when the medium reaches the end of tubing immediately before it connects to the device (Figure 2, Stop #1).\nUnscrew the upper and lower plates of the device. Carefully remove the upper plate and place 1,500 - 1,550 μl of medium (either medium alone or plus the experimental chemokines) into the lower wells. Make sure the well contains sufficient medium to form a hemisphere that reaches approximately 1 - 2 mm above the lower plate.",
    "Transfer the prepared insert from the Petri dish to the wells of the lower plate using sterile forceps, making sure that no bubbles are trapped beneath the inserts. Aspirate any medium that appears on the surface of the lower plate to ensure that the plate remains dry. Place the upper plate back onto the lower plate and re-connect the plates using the screws.\nImmediately turn on the peristaltic pump and allow medium to flow through the 3D device. Elevate the outlet end of the device and maintain the chamber in this position to prevent formation of bubbles within the space between the plates.\nAllow the medium to fill the chamber and the tubing connecting the chamber to the gas exchange unit. Stop the pump immediately before the medium reaches the gas exchange unit (Figure 2; Stop #2). Place 3 ml of medium into the gas exchange unit, turn on the pump, and allow the air bubbles to escape through the gas exchange unit. Elevate the gas exchange unit to allow the medium to fill the tubing exiting the gas exchange unit and stop the pump when the medium reaches 2 - 3 cm before the end of the outlet tubing (Figure 2, Stop #3).\nConnect the inlet metal needle to the outlet using small sterile napkins. Reprogram the pump so the medium flows in the opposite direction (clockwise) toward the gas exchange unit and ensure any air bubbles are removed once they reach the gas exchange unit. Check that no air bubbles remain in the system.",
    "Reprogram the pump so the medium flows counterclockwise. Add 100 μl of the test cell suspension to the gas exchange unit. Close the lid of the gas exchange unit, place the tray with the working system back into the incubator, and allow the test cells to circulate in the 3D device at 37 °C for the desired time. \t\nNote: Clean the electrical cord of the pump with 70% ethanol and place it inside of the incubator.\n5. Terminate the Test and Collect Samples for Assay\nRemove the tray with the working system from the incubator and place in the hood. Stop the pump, disconnect the inlet and outlet, and place the ends into empty sterile 15 ml tubes.\nTurn on the pump and collect the cell suspension from the system; place the cell suspension on ice, if appropriate, until use.\nDisassemble the chamber by removing the screws and lifting off the upper plate. Remove the inserts from the lower plate and transfer them to Petri dishes.\nNote: The inserts can be stained to visualize and count cells in situ (crystal violet 0.05% in dH2O) or trypsinized to collect the EC for further testing.\nRemove the medium and cells from the lower wells into tubes and centrifuge for 5 min at 210 x g. Remove the supernatant, wash and resuspend the cells as desired, and process the cells according to the specific experimental goals (discussed further below)."
