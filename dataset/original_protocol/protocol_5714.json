    "Preparation of seedling plants for infectionSeeds treatment and germinationPut tomato seeds into a cheesecloth or nylon bag and then incubate in a 50 °C water bath for 25 min. Briefly submerge the seeds in tap water to cool down to room temperature.After that, transfer the seeds to a 10% trisodium phosphate (TSP) solution for 15 min and rinse (at least 5 times) in autoclaved distilled water for 5 min at room temperature to remove residual disinfectant.Germinate tomato seeds for 48 h on a wet filter paper at room temperature in the dark (Figure 1B). Sow the germinated seeds in soil and cultivate in growth chambers under cycles of 16 h light at 25 °C and 8 h darkness at 18 °C. (The light intensity for light cycle was 200 μM photons m-2 sec-1 in our growth chamber.) For disease assay, the tomato seedlings are grown for 4 weeks (Figure 1C). Note: In our lab, we use Miracle-Gro® Garden Soil (for Vegetables) for plant incubation, which is pre-sterile and less labor cost. Because plants grow faster in this soil, thus we use 4-week plants for the disease assay. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180418/20180418021752_5416.jpgFigure 1.

A 4-week-old tomato plant for inoculation assay.Fungal strains and growth conditionsB. cinerea B05.10 used in this study is routinely maintained on 2x V8 agar for 21 days at 20 °C under a 12-h photoperiod prior to spore collection (Figure 2A). Harvest spores by scrubbing the plates with pipette tips until the tips have about 2 ml amount of tissues, then suspend in 5 ml 1% SMB.",
    "Filter the suspensions through nylon mesh on a funnel to remove mycelia (Figure 2B, Video 1). <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. How to collect spores Measure the concentration of spores with a counting chamber. Figure 2B shows the small squares of counting chamber we used under 20x objective. The counting chamber is 0.1 mm sample depth. The small square is 1/400 mm2 as shown in Figure 2B. It makes the volume of each small square 2.5 x 10-7 ml/square. Each spore in a small square is equal to 4 x 106 spores/ml. Adjust the concentration to 1 x 106 spores/ml for inoculation.Set a solution of 1% SMB without spores as the control treatment.Plant infection assayThe 4-week-old plants are selected for infection assay (Figure 1C). For the pathogenicity test on detached leaves: Individually harvest the leaflet of the third true leaves of 4-week-old plants and gently place in Petri dishes containing 25 ml 0.8% agar, with the petiole embedded in the medium (Video 1). Inoculate each leaflet with a single 5 μl spore suspensions droplet on the right or left of main midrib (Video 2). Cover plates with lids, followed by sealing with Micropore tape.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. How to place a detached leaflet on medium Place the plates under the same conditions as for plant growth (Figure 2C). Monitor the disease development by scanning the plates 3 days after infection. The size of the infected area was measured with ImageJ.For the pathogenicity test on living plants Place 4-week-old plants in a transparent box (Figure 1A), which keeps the humidity at 100%. Inoculate the third true leaves with B. cinerea. Each leaflet is infected with a single 5 μl spore suspensions droplet on right or left of the main midrib (Video 3).",
    "Cover the box with lid and keep it under the same conditions used for plant growth (Figure 2D, Video 3).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Infecting a leaflet with a droplet of spore suspension Harvest the infected leaflets at different time points (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 h) after infection (HAI) for profiling resistance gene expression or at 3 days after infection (DAI) for monitoring disease development by imaging the leaflets. Then measure the size of the infected area on those leaflets with ImageJ (see Data analysis), following the procedure of the imageJ User Guide (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/index.html[href=https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/index.html]).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180418/20180418022404_1732.jpgFigure 2.

Pathogenicity test on detached leaves, the right leaflet was inoculated with a single 5 μl spore suspensions (106 spores/ml) droplet on the right or left of main midrib, while the left leaflet was set as control. The scale bar stands for 1 cm. D. Pathogenicity test on living plants, each leaflet was inoculated with a single 5 μl spore suspensions (106 spores/ml) droplet on the right or left of the main midrib. The areas infected by B. cinerea that developed for 3 days were highlighted with red circles."
