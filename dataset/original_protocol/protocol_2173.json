    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHabituation and handling of animals\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThis step is to habituate the mice to both the researcher conducting the experiments and the testing environments to which the mice will be exposed.\nIf purchasing the mice from an external supplier, ensure that they arrive at least one week prior to behavioral testing.\nTransport mice, preferably using a trolley, to a quiet room. The light intensity for the room should be 30–70 Lux.\nLeave animals to settle for 30 min.\nGently remove the first mouse by gently holding the base of its tail and place it on gloved hand. Allow the mouse some restricted movement on the hand and wrist.\nAfter 2 min of handling, gently return the mouse to its home cage.\nIf the mouse has urinated or dropped scat on the glove, wipe off with tissue paper and spray with 80% (v/v) ethanol.\nOnce gloves are dry pick up the next mouse and repeat the procedure.\nRepeat this procedure at the same time for the next two days.\nCritical: If both males and females are being tested, habituate the same sex at the same time. Once all animals of one sex have been habituated, thoroughly wipe down the area and return the animals to the holding rooms/ carousels. Depending on the air turnover rate, wait 30–60 min before habituating the other sex. This is to allow sufficient time for scents and pheromones to dissipate. The same approach should also be used during testing of animals.\nCritical: One experimenter should perform the entire procedure (both habituation and testing) and should wear the same laboratory coat to limit olfactory cues.",
    "Note: Aged mice are generally used to being handled as they have gone through numerous cage changes during their lives. They should, however, still be handled prior to behavioral testing by the person who will perform the experiment, as it will habituate them to that person and reduce their anxiety levels.\nNovel object location test (1–2 days)\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThe novel object location (NOL) test is based on the spontaneous tendency of mice to spend more time exploring a novel object than a familiar one (Akirav and Maroun, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Assini et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Haettig et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Leiter et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Murai et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Vogel-Ciernia and Wood, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Mice are first allowed to explore an arena with two objects. In the second trial, one of the objects is moved and the amount of time the mouse spends exploring the object in the novel location is determined.\nCritical: Behavioral tests should always be performed during a fixed time period and remain constant for the entirety of the testing. Ideally, it is better to perform tests during the dark phase to minimize the disruption to the animals’ sleep patterns. Animals should be maintained on a reverse light cycle and tested during their active dark cycle (Beeler et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). However, most animal houses use a 12:12 light: dark cycle with the light phase between 7 am and 7 pm. If it is not possible to reverse this cycle, aim to conduct behavioral testing during the initial hours of the light phase.\nNOL test - day 1.\nPlace boxes (ours are made of white Perspex with dimensions of 37 × 48 × 19 cm) on a 70 cm high pedestal.\nAlign the boxes with markings on the pedestal to allow for the consistent placement of boxes during testing.",
    "Note: Each box should have a piece of black tape along one edge to aid in spatial navigation.\nSet the light intensity over the box to 50–100 Lux.\nCritical: There should be minimal shadows in the boxes. If two boxes are used, ensure a gap between them to allow for post-test analysis.\nSecure two identical objects (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) in each box 3 cm away from the long edge and 5 cm away from short edge of the box as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B (left box).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1756-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Novel object location test\n(A) A mouse is placed in a white Perspex box containing two identical objects and allowed to explore (left box). In a second trial one of the objects is moved to a new location (right box) and the animal is retested.\n(B) Two identical objects approximately 10–15 cm in height are required.\nCritical: Significant variation can exist between the novel objects that are selected. Ideally the objects should be of similar size, durable, unable to be climbed, and easily cleaned. Many studies have relied on building blocks of various sizes to build novel and complex shapes. Extremely complex shapes using small building blocks are difficult to replicate and clean sufficiently, especially to remove the scent of previous mice. Although larger blocks are easier to clean, this requires dismantling the shape. To circumvent these issues, we 3D print objects and have included the files required to produce them (see Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1756-Mmc2.zip], S2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1756-Mmc3.zip], S3[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1756-Mmc4.zip], and S4[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1756-Mmc5.zip] and Figures S1–S4[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1756-Mmc1.pdf]). Our objects are all printed on a Ultimaker S5 FDM printer with orange ABS filament, 0.1 mm slice thickness and 20% fill.",
    "Optional: Lightly cover the bottom of the box with bedding. Some researchers believe that having bedding covering the arena floor lowers the anxiety of the mice during testing. Appropriate handling of animals prior to any testing will also minimize this risk. However, some strains are inherently anxious. If bedding is not used, the base of the open field should be a matte finish to minimize reflections during the video tracking.\nBring animals into the ante-room or testing room for habituation.\nLeave animals to habituate for a minimum of 30 min.\nRecord 1–3 s of video showing empty boxes with the objects to be used for mask creation during the analysis phase. A “mask” is a region of interest that defines the location of the objects that the animals will be examining.\nStart video recording.\nOptional: Hold a card identifying the run number or animal ID for record keeping/analysis purposes or place it on the edge of the pedestal at the start of recording.\nNote: We recommend a Firewire video camera, suitable for use in low-light settings, that can capture 15–60 frames per second, e.g., a Point-grey FL2 or FL3 video camera, or similar.\nCritical: Do NOT leave the card on top of the box during testing.\nGently pick up the first mouse from the home box and place it in the middle of the NOL box facing away from the objects.\nIf a second box and mouse is being tested, simultaneously place the second mouse in the second box.\nRetreat behind the curtain during recording and ensure that the lid to the mouse home cage is secured to minimize any scent.",
    "After a pre-determined duration, stop the video recording. Re-testing can be conducted either 90 min following the first test or after 24 h (long-term memory). For shorter re-test periods, a 5 min exploratory period can be used. For a long-term re-test, a 10 min exploratory time is recommended.\nRetrieve mouse and place it back in home cage.\nEmpty bedding into a clinical waste bin. Clean down the box and objects with 80% (v/v) ethanol.\nRefill the box with bedding and ensure that it is placed back in the correct spot.\nRepeat steps h-o until all animals are tested.\nNOL test - day 2.\nSet up the testing room exactly as on day 1.\nMove one of the two identical objects to a novel location 3 cm from the long edge and 14 cm from the short edge of the box (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B; right box).\nCritical: The novel location should be alternated during testing to minimize the chance of nonspecific cues affecting the mouse’s exploration.\nCritical: Ensure the novel location is noted in a template, i.e., A or B for later accurate analysis.\nRepeat steps 9 e–o until all animals are tested.\nAnalysis.\nNote: Several parameters are included within Ethovision XT to aid in the analysis of the NOL test.\nCritical: Setting masks appropriately in Ethovision is critical to ensure accurate data collection.\nCreate masks both immediately around the objects and a second “zone of interest” 0.5–1 cm bordering the objects.\nCritical: This step is required to determine if the animals are paying interest to the objects.\nFor this test it is recommended to use the 3-point body analysis option so that the direction of the head can be automatically determined during analysis.",
    "Note: Alternatives to the Ethovision software are also available, including Deep Lab Cut and ezTrack (Pennington et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nNote: See the following manuscript for a review of free animal-tracking software applications (Panadeiro et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nBarnes maze\nTiming: 4–5 days\nIn this task, mice are placed in the center of a brightly lit table with 32 evenly spaced holes around its circumference. They are then tested for their ability to use the visual cues placed around the room to locate the one hole with an escape chamber located beneath it (Barnes, 1979[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Harrison et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Leiter et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Reiserer et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nPrepare room for Barnes maze testing.\nOur Barnes maze consists of a circular white piece of acrylic plastic (100 cm diameter) with 32 holes each measuring 5 cm in diameter evenly spaced around the circumference 7.5 cm from the outer edge. The Barnes maze is placed on a 70 cm high pedestal located in the middle of the behavioral room equidistant from all walls (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). There is one removable escape tunnel underneath the Barnes maze. The tracking rails for this escape tunnel ensure the maze remains in the same location throughout the experiment (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1756-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Barnes maze test\n(A) A circular table with 32 evenly spaced holes around its circumference is placed on a pedestal in the center of a room with a different cue placed on each of the four walls.\n(B) Tracking rails for the escape tunnel are located under the Barnes maze to ensure that the maze remains in the same location throughout the experiment and to allow for placement of the escape tunnel.\n(C) The escape tunnel can be fitted with a ramp to aid aged animals to enter.",
    "(D) A start chamber consisting of a laminated square of paper, and a darkened beaker is used to place the mouse in the starting location.\nPlace a clean tissue in the end of the escape tunnel.\nNote: For aged animals or those animals with mild motor deficits, use an acrylic plastic ramp inside the escape tunnel at an angle of less than 45° as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C. This is to encourage these animals to enter the escape tunnel. The ramp should be the same color as the escape tunnel so that it does not provide an additional spatial cue.\nPlace spatial cues equally around the walls level with the Barnes maze surface.\nSet light intensity to 1000 Lux.\nBring mice into the testing or ante-room to habituate for at least 30 min.\nHabituation of mice to the Barnes maze.\nAttach the escape chamber and place clean paper towel in the end of the chamber (this will act as bedding and should help to reduce stress).\nPlace the mouse into the escape tunnel.\nAfter 1 min gently remove the mouse from the chamber and place it in the center of the apparatus.\nAllow the mouse to explore until it enters the escape tunnel.\nIf 5 min have elapsed without the animal locating the escape tunnel, gently move it to the tunnel.\nAfter 30 s in the escape tunnel place the animal back in its home box.\nClean the escape tunnel and Barnes maze with 80% (v/v) ethanol.\nRepeat with the next animal.\nAcquisition of Barnes maze data. Three or four days of acquisition with three trials per day are commonly used. There should be at least 1 h between each daily trial.",
    "Critical: Ensure that the escape tunnel is in a different location to that used during habituation (move the tunnel 90 °).\nClick the start record button for the camera.\nGently remove the mouse from its home cage and place it onto a laminated square of paper – do not let go of its tail.\nContinuing to hold the tail, lower the start chamber (consisting of a darkened beaker) down, ensuring that the beaker spout is aligned with the tail (to prevent injuring it).\nSet down the laminated square, mouse and chamber down in the starting location (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCarefully pull the laminated square out without releasing the mouse.\nWait for 15 s.\nLift the start chamber and retreat behind the curtain.\nStop the trial when the mouse enters the escape tunnel, or once 3 min have elapsed. If a mouse fails to enter the escape tunnel place it gently in the escape tunnel for 15 s.\nClick the stop record button for the camera.\nClean the escape tunnel, Barnes maze and start chamber and laminated square with 80% (v/v) ethanol. Add fresh tissue to the escape tunnel.\nRepeat with the next animal.\nNote: Each mouse should be placed in the center of the appropriate quadrant of the apparatus. Each daily trial of the mouse should be initiated from a different quadrant. A template of running order will aid in ensuring that this is done accurately.\nProbe trial (Optional). The probe trial is to test the memory consolidation of the mice following the acquisition phase. Typically, a well-trained mouse will move directly to the escape hole where the tunnel was located, thereby showing spatial bias and evidence of spatial learning.\nDo not add the escape tunnel to the maze.\nClick the start record button for the camera.",
    "As described above, move the mouse over to the maze with the laminated square and start chamber. Place it in the center of the appropriate quadrant on the apparatus.\nWait for 15 s and then lift the start chamber.\nStop the trial after 1 min.\nClick the stop record button for the camera.\nCollect the mouse and return it to its home cage.\nClean the Barnes maze and start chamber with 80% (v/v) ethanol.\nRepeat with the next mouse.\nActive place avoidance\nTiming: 1–6 days\nThis task involves the mice using visual cues to orient themselves within a rotating arena in order to actively avoid a stationary shock zone (Cimadevilla et al., 2000a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5], 2000b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Leiter et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Vukovic et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Willis et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17], 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nActive place avoidance (APA) apparatus and tracking setup.\nOur APA apparatus (BioSignal Group) consists of a square elevated arena under evenly spaced metal bars (0.5 cm apart) enclosed by a 32 cm high transparent circular boundary (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1756-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. APA test\nAnimals are placed on a rotating arena and must use visual cues placed around the room to actively avoid a stationary shock zone.\nNote: The APA apparatus can also be purchased from Conduct Science. The original developers of the APA paradigm also included detailed manufacturing instructions in their initial publications (Cimadevilla et al., 2000b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7], 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nThe APA apparatus should be placed directly under a ceiling-mounted camera, with the position of the mouse being tracked using Tracker software (BioSignal Group).\nThe arena rotates (typically counterclockwise at a speed of 1 rpm) and a foot shock (500 ms, 60 Hz, 0.5 mA) is delivered when the mouse enters a pre-designated 60 ° shock zone.",
    "Place four cues equally around the room at the same height as the rotating platform. Cues should typically be 30–50 cm from the platform.\nNote: Cues need to be different from each other, and similar cues (e.g., a filled circle and a filled oval) should be avoided. Cues should be of A3 size or larger and typically black and white in nature. Laminating the cues increases durability and allows for easy cleaning.\nLight levels should be 30–70 Lux.\nBefore starting, create a folder in the Tracker program and select the APA task. This will populate the tabs required to configure the parameters required to run the test. This can then be saved as a configuration file and modified as required.\nIn the “Experiment” tab select the duration of the experiment. This is represented as seconds, i.e., 10 min is 600 s.\nEnsure that the “Enable Timer” is ticked. Within this it is possible to alter various shock parameters. Common settings are: shock initiation latency = 500; shock duration = 500; outside refractory = 1500; and inter-shock latency = 1500. All shock timings are in milliseconds.\nSelect the “Target” tab and then ensure that the circular mask includes the entire area of interest. The mask is to define the area in which the mouse is tracked during the APA task.\nSelect the angle and size of the aversive zone, represented by a shaded wedge. A typical shock zone is 60 degrees and extends from the center point to the edge of the arena. These settings can be altered using the “Target” tab by clicking on the edit button.\nUsing the “Tracking” tab you can select if the animal is darker or lighter than the rig (e.g., darker is used for C57BL/6 animals).",
    "Clicking the “From Calibrator” tab allows appropriate thresholds for effective tracking of the animal to be set. This includes the size of the animals.\nThe “Mask” tab will ensure that only the arena is included in the tracking of the animal.\nThe “Device” tab allows the rotation direction and speed of the arena to be set using the velocity button.\nThe current source section allows for the shock intensity to be set. The most common setting for mice is 0.5 mA. The mode of current is typically set to Track dependent; however, shocks can be set to be delivered at a constant time. Previous tracks can also be used to shock an animal. This is typically done to provide a yoked control animal that received the same number of shocks but not in a spatially dependent manner.\nHabituation to the APA arena (1 day).\nBring animals into the ante-room or testing room for habituation. Leave the animals to habituate for a minimum of 30 min.\nSet up the Tracker software.\nHabituation to the APA apparatus typically involves a 5 min exposure where the apparatus is rotating but no shocks are delivered.\nPlace the animal on the opposite side to the aversive shock zone, facing the arena.\nRetreat behind the curtain and begin the trial.\nEnsure the animal is being tracked efficiently.\nAt the end of the trial gently pick up the animal and return it to its home cage.\nRemove any scat from the arena and grid. Wipe down the grid and arena with 80% (v/v) ethanol.\nRepeat steps 17 d–h for all animals.\nAcquisition training using APA (1–6 days).\nSet the room light to same intensity as on the habituation day.",
    "Bring animals into the ante-room or testing room for habituation. Leave them to habituate for a minimum of 30 min.\nSet up the Tracker software.\nSet the duration of the trial.\nNote: Common times are 10 min for up to 6 days or a single trial of 20 or 30 min.\nEnsure that the current source is on and set (i.e., 0.5 mA).\nRepeat steps 17 d–h for all animals.\nNote: In some experimental paradigms researchers test animals prior to an intervention in order to obtain baseline spatial learning ability. Following treatment, animals need to be re-tested to examine changes in cognitive ability. The APA testing paradigm can accommodate this by changing several components of the test. This includes changing the rotation of the APA apparatus from clockwise to anti-clockwise. The aversive zone can also be moved to an alternative location and novel cues can be used to alter the parameters of the test. These changes will provide a novel spatial task for the animals to learn. There is no need to conduct a second habituation session in this instance.\nCritical: The bedding in the home cage should not be changed during the behavioral testing as this could provide stimulation that affects performance.\nCritical: It is important to remain quiet while the animals are performing the task, as any noise may result in additional cues that affect performance.\nReversal acquisition training (Optional, 1–6 days).\nIn the Reversal test, the shock zone is re-located to a new location, typically 180 degrees from the original shock zone and the animals are tested for their ability to flexibly learn a novel location.\nRepeat steps 18 a–f for all animals.\nProbe trial (Optional, 1 day).\nSet room light intensity.",
    "Bring animals into the ante-room or testing room for habituation. Leave animals to habituate for a minimum of 30 min.\nSet up the Tracker software.\nSet the duration of the trial to 10 min.\nFor this trial do not turn the current source on.\nPlace the animal on the opposite side to the aversive shock zone, facing the arena.\nRetreat behind the curtain and begin trial.\nEnsure the animal is being tracked efficiently.\nCarefully observe the animal. When it enters the aversive shock zone area stop the trial.\nGently pick up the animal and return to home cage.\nRemove any scat from arena and grid. Wipe down grid and arena with 80% (v/v) ethanol.\nRepeat steps 20 f–k for all animals."
