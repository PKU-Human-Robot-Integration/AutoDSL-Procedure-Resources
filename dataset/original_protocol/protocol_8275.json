    "1. Prepare Liposomes\nDisperse phospholipids (e.g., 10 mg in powder) in chloroform at a desired concentration (e.g., 10 mg/mL).\nEvaporate chloroform.\n\t\nPlace the phospholipid solution in a round-bottom flask and set it on a rotary evaporator (see Table of Materials) connected to a N2 gas cylinder. Rotate the flask under N2 flow at room temperature until a thin phospholipid film appears (after ~30 min).\nPlace the open flask into a desiccator that is connected to a vacuum pump. Using the vacuum pump, aspirate the inside of the desiccator for several hours to remove the chloroform thoroughly.\nAdd an appropriate volume of an electrolyte solution to the flask and suspend the phospholipid to obtain a 2 mg/mL phospholipid suspension.\nSonicate the suspension for several tens of seconds using a bath sonicator (see Table of Materials) to obtain a multilayered vesicle (MLV) suspension.\nFor preparation of proteoliposomes that contain ion channel proteins, add a protein solution (with the proteins solubilized using appropriate detergents; 2% volume is the maximum) to the MLV suspension and sonicate for several seconds using the bath sonicator.\n2. Prepare Large-Bore Glass Pipettes\nSet a glass capillary to a pipette puller and fabricate micropipettes with a fine tapered tip through two-step pulling.\nSet the micropipette on a microforge and contact the tip of the micropipette to a platinum filament at the tapered portion with a diameter of 30 to 50 µm.\nHeat the filament briefly (5 s) and immediately turn it off.\n\tNOTE: This manipulation forms a crack at the heating point, whereby the tip of the micropipette is cut off, leaving a wide bore with a diameter of 30 to 50 µm.\n3. Treat the Surface of Glass Slide with a Shallow Concave Well (Siliconization for a Water-Repellent Finish)",
    "Clean the surface of the glass slide with a shallow well with distilled water and ethanol.\nApply an appropriate volume (e.g., 100 µL) of a siliconizing reagent (water-repellent) onto the hole slide glass.\nDry the reagent completely in the air.\nPlace the glass slide on the stage of an inverted microscope.\n4. Form the CBB and Perform Electrophysiological Measurement\nAdd 100 µL of hexadecane into the shallow well of the siliconized hole slide glass.\n\t​NOTE: For the lipid-out method, phospholipids are dispersed in hexadecane (20 mg/mL) beforehand.\nFill the electrolyte solution up to half the length of the micropipette, using a tuberculin syringe.\nSet the micropipette onto the micropipette holder with a pressure port, allowing the Ag/AgCl wire electrode to soak into the pipette electrolyte solution.\nConnect one of the micropipette holders to the head stage of a patch-clamp amplifier and the other one to the electrical ground.\nConnect a microinjector to the pressure port of the micropipette holder.\nSet the micropipette to an appropriate position above the stage of an inverted microscope by manipulating the micromanipulator.\nAdjust the electrode offset potential.\n\t\nPlace 1 µL of the same electrolyte solution used to fill the micropipette on the flat surface around the shallow well of the hole slide glass, creating an electrolyte dome.\nSoak the tip of both micropipettes into the electrolyte dome by manipulating the micromanipulator.\nAdjust the electrode offset potential of the patch-clamp amplifier.\nConfirm the correct offset at the end of experiments by breaking the CBB via application of a high membrane potential (electrical breakdown; using Zap on the amplifier), causing the two bubbles to be fused into one (bubble fusion).",
    "Correct the liquid junction potential54 in the cases where asymmetric electrolyte solutions are used, such that the calculated value is added to the applied membrane potential for the true membrane potential.\n\t\tNOTE: The liquid junction potential is calculated using the program JPCalc55.\nDraw the liposome solution from the tip.\n\t​NOTE: When water-soluble channels are examined using the lipid-out method, suctioning of the liposome solution is not necessary.\n\t\nPlace 1 µL of liposome solution on the flat surface around the shallow well of the hole slide glass (liposome-containing dome).\nManipulate the micromanipulator and insert the tip of the micropipette into the liposome-containing dome.\nAspirate the liposome-containing solution by lowering the pressure inside the micropipette holder using the microinjector.\nRepeat the procedure for the other pipette.\nManipulate the micromanipulator and dip the tip of the micropipette into the hexadecane in the shallow well.\nBlow a water bubble slowly by increasing the pressure until the bubble reaches the desired size (e.g., 50 µm in diameter) and maintain the same pressure thereafter.\nDiscard the bubbles by passing the tip through the oil-air interface if it is hard to keep the size of the bubbles stable.\nRepeat steps 4.8 to 4.9 until stable bubbles are formed.\nManipulate the bubbles to allow contact between them (Figure 5).\n\tNOTE: Sometimes, the bubbles approach each other spontaneously to form the CBB. In other cases, the bubbles are close but do not contact each other. In this case, push the bubbles each other mechanically.\nFine-tune the pressure to maintain the bubble size, because the size may gradually change even at the constant intra-bubble pressure.\nSet the membrane potential to the appropriate value using the patch-clamp amplifier and wait for the channel current to emerge (Figure 6).\n5. Measure Bilayer Capacitance",
    "Measure the bilayer electrical capacitance (Cel) by applying a ramp potential.\n\tNOTE: When the rate of the voltage change in the ramp command is 10 mV/10 ms (or 1 V/s) followed by -10 mV/10 ms, the amplitude of the current jump upon changes in the slope corresponds to the read of the membrane'scapacitance value (e.g., 100 pA → 100 pF).\nEvaluate the bilayer area of two bubbles stacked one on the other and focus the microscope at the bilayer level to view the edge of the bilayer (Figure 6).\n\tNOTE: The bilayer shape is mostly circular, and the area is calculated from the radius.\nCalculate the specific membrane capacitance (Csp) by dividing the electrical capacitance by the bilayer area (Csp = Cel/A).\nCalculate the bilayer thickness (thickness of the hydrophobic core) using Dc = (εrε0)/Csp (where εr and ε0 represent the permittivity of the hydrophobic region of the bilayer and the permittivity of a vacuum, respectively).\nSubscription Required.
