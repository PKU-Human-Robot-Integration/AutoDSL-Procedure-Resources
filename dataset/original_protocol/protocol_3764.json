    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nFixing and permeabilization\nTiming: 1.5 h\nOrganoids must be fixed prior to staining to preserve protein localization and structure, and to prevent degradation. Permeabilization disrupts the cell membrane to allow for intracellular staining.\nFix the organoids.\nAspirate media from the wells of disc culture, leaving only the Matrigel discs containing the spheroids/organoids.\nPut 2 mL of fixative in each well and incubate plate at 4°C for 15 min. After 15 min, swirl the plate by hand and place back at 4°C for another 15 min.\nPipette to break up the Matrigel and transfer into a labeled 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCritical: Unless otherwise stated, all steps that involve mixing of organoids will use a P1000 tip with the tip cut off at the end. This is done to prevent mechanical disruption of the organoids. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nWash and permeabilization\nWash: Centrifuge the organoids at 2300 × g for 5 min in a microcentrifuge. Aspirate off the supernatant, paying careful attention to not disrupt the pellet. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 0.1% TBSTX with a P1000 and repeat centrifugation and aspiration.\nResuspend each pellet in 1 mL 0.5% TBSTX.\nPlace tubes on rotator at room temperature (20°C–22°C) to permeabilize for 30 min.\nBlocking and staining\nTiming: 1.5 days\nBlocking prevents non-specific staining before any antibodies are added. The primary antibody will detect the protein of interest, and the secondary antibody will detect the primary antibody and allow for fluorescent imaging.\nBlocking and primary immunostaining\nRepeat wash step in 2a.\nResuspend pellets in 1 mL Antibody Dilution Buffer.\nPlace on rotator for 1 h at room temperature (20°C–22°C) to block.\nPause Point: Organoids can be left in the Antibody Dilution Buffer for blocking overnight (12–16 h).",
    "For fibroblast/tumor cell staining: add both the anti-smooth muscle actin antibody and the anti-cytokeratin 8/18 antibody at a dilution of 1:250 each, directly to the Antibody Dilution Buffer. For β-catenin staining: add the anti-β-catenin antibody to a final dilution of 1:500 directly to the Antibody Dilution Buffer.\nPlace on rotator at 4°C for 12–16 h.\nOptional: Staining can be done for shorter time periods at room temperature (20°C–22°C) or 37°C, but this will need to be optimized for each antibody and may increase background staining. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nSecondary immunostaining\nRemove from rotator and repeat wash step in 2a.\nResuspend pellets in 1 mL Antibody Dilution Buffer.\nFor fibroblast/tumor cell staining: Add anti-guinea pig and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies, each at a dilution of 1:250, directly to the Antibody Dilution Buffer/organoid suspension. For β-catenin staining: Add anti-mouse secondary antibody to a final dilution of 1:500 in Antibody Dilution Buffer.\nPlace on rotator in the dark at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 3 h.\nSlide preparation and imaging\nTiming: 1 h (preparation)\nSlide preparation is the final step that must be done before slides can be stored indefinitely. Imaging and analysis can occur days or weeks after the slides have been prepared and sealed.\nWash and mount on slide\nRepeat wash step in 2a\nOptional: Resuspend pellet in 0.1% TBSTX. Add Hoechst at a 1:1000 dilution directly to 0.1% TBSTX, rotate for 20 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C) in the dark and repeat wash step in 2a.\nOptional: Resuspend pellet in 0.1% TBSTX. Add phalloidin at a 1:100 dilution directly to 0.1% TBSTX, rotate for 20 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C) in the dark and repeat wash step in 2a.\nRemove as much of the supernatant as possible without disturbing the pellet.",
    "Resuspend organoids in 50 uL PBS with a P200 with the end of the tip cut off and pipette the organoid suspension onto a labeled slide.\nAllow the organoids to settle. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nTip the slide slightly so that the PBS pools in one spot, leaving the majority of the organoids in place. Aspirate the PBS, taking care not to disturb the organoids.\nPipette 50 uL Prolong Gold Antifade onto the slide.\nNote: If using Hoescht, use Prolong Gold without DAPI. If not using Hoescht, use Prolong Gold with DAPI. Prolong Gold enables long-term storage of slides prior to imaging, as long as the slides are sealed and properly stored.\nPlace a coverslip over the slide without creating bubbles.\nSeal the edges with clear nail polish and allow to cure in the dark for 5–10 min.\nPause Point: Store in a dark box at 4°C until ready to image.\nImage\nOn the microscope, use the focusing adjustment knobs to adjust the z-plane down to the bottom of the organoid of interest and select it as “bottom.”\nAdjust the z-plane up to the top of the organoid and select it as “top.”\nUse the recommended step size (typically 1–2 um).\nSelect “create Z-stack.”\nOnce finished, save file.\nNote: If imaging multiple color channels, make sure to image from the longest wavelength to the shortest wavelength (i.e., image 561 then 488 then 405) to prevent bleaching. Samples will bleach faster at higher magnifications, so always start with low magnifications before going to higher magnifications.\nPerform analysis of your choice."
