    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nQuantitative proteomics analysis of adult Drosophila heads\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this study, we use two autophagy mutants: Atg8aKG07569 (Scott et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) and Atg8a LDS (LIR motif docking site) mutant (Rahman et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). It is hypothesized that these flies have defective LIR motif binding ability and thus accumulate LIR motif containing proteins. We perform label-free quantitative proteomic to analyze the accumulated proteins in Atg8a LDS, Atg8a mutant compare to wild type flies. The accumulated proteins are putative selective autophagy receptors.\nSample preparation for Label-Free-Quantification (LFQ) based mass spectrometry analysis.\nIn this protocol, we use 200 μg of protein extraction for digestion.\nCalculate the required volume of 200 μg protein according to the protein concentration.\nMix 200 μg of protein extraction with UA buffer in the filter tube (Millipore, UFC500396).\nMake sure the total volume is 400 μL.\nCentrifuge the filter units at 12, 000 g for 20 min at 4°C and discard the flow-through from the collection tube.\nAdd 400 μL of UA buffer to the filter tube.\nCentrifuge at 12, 000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Discard the flow-through from the collection tube.\nRepeat steps (c-d) two times.\nAdd 300 μL of UA buffer and 6 μL of 1 M DTT buffer to the filter tube. Mix and incubate at 37°C for 1 h.\nAdd 30 μL of 1 M IAA buffer to the filter tube. Mix and incubate at 25°C for 1 h.\nCritical: Make sure the filter tube is cooled to 25°C before adding the IAA buffer.\nNote: Incubate in dark place.\nAlternatives: Reduction and alkylation can also be use 10 mM TCEP (Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) and 40 mM CAA (Cyanoacetamide) in ABC buffer for 30 min at 25°C.",
    "Centrifuge at 12, 000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Discard the flow-through from the collection tube.\nAdd 400 μL of UA buffer to the filter tube.\nCentrifuge at 12, 000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Discard the flow-through from the collection tube.\nRepeat steps (i-j) two times.\nAdd 400 μL of ABC buffer to the filter tube.\nCentrifuge at 12, 000 g for 20 min at 4°C. Discard the flow-through from the collection tube.\nRepeat steps (l-m) two times.\nAdd 200 μL ABC buffer with trypsin (enzyme to protein ratio 1: 50), incubate at 37°C for 20 h.\nNote: Change to a new collection tube before adding trypsin.\nNote: When incubating, wrap the lid of the filter tube with sealing film.\nCentrifuge the filter units at 12, 000 g for 20 min at 4°C.\nAdd 200 μL ABC buffer and centrifuge the filter units at 12, 000 g for 20 min at 4°C.\nCollect the tryptic peptides from the collection tube.\nEvaporate the samples to dryness using a Labconco Speedvac (Centrivap, Labconco, USA), usually for 3–4 h.\nStore the samples at −20°C until use. A workflow of sample preparation for Mass spectrometry is shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2142-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Critical: All biological repeats are digested at the same time to improve the repeatability. If your repeats are digested in batches, make sure you use the same materials and methods.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at this point for up to 1 month at −80°C.\nMass spectrometry and statistical analysis\nTiming: weeks\nTryptic peptides are analyzed by mass spectrometry to identify the accumulated proteins in Atg8aKG07569, Atg8a LDS mutant compared to wild type flies.\nSamples are analyzed by mass spectrometry.\nPrepare LC-MS/MS equipment.\nBoth MS and MS/MS calibration should be carried out at regular intervals (monthly and at the beginning of a new batch of an experiment).\nInstall fresh mobile solvent A and solvent B in sufficient amounts.\nInstall the precolumn and analytical chromatography column.\nFlush air of pump A, pump B and pump S with mobile phase buffer. The flush threshold is 10 μL.\nEquilibrate the precolumn and analytical column with solvent A buffers.\nCheck LC-MS/MS performance by running a blank sample. Ensure the mobile phase flow path is smooth.\nIt is highly recommended to use quality control samples such as mixtures of standards to check if the LC-MS/MS performs as expected.\nPrepare the samples.\nDissolve tryptic peptides in 200 μL of 0.1% formic acid (solvent A).\nCentrifuge peptides at 12, 000 g for 20 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new Eppendorf tube.\nLoad 10 μL samples into an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC (Dionex) using an Acclaim PepMap μ-precolumn catridge (C18, 5 μm, 100 Å, 300 μm × 5 mm) and an analytical Acclaim PepMap RSLC column (C18, 2 μm, 100 Å, 75 μm × 50 cm, Thermo Scientific).\nLC gradient and LC parameter settings are in the table below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2142_10.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2142_11.csv",
    "Peptides are subjected to Nano Spray ionization (NSI) source followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in Thermo Orbitrap Fusion coupled online to UPLC (Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano HPLC) (Dionex) or Q exactive coupled online to EASY-nLC 1000 system.\nThe electrospray voltage applied is 2.1 kV.\nThe m/z scan range is 375–1,575 m/z for full scan, and intact peptides are detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000 resolution with a 2 × 105 ion count target.\nThe maximum injection time is set to 150 ms.\nTandem MS is performed with an isolation window at 1.2 Th using the Quadrupole. Use of wider isolation windows improves sensitivity, but noise of ions also increases. We set isolation window at 1.2 Th for Orbitrap Fusion Mass Spectrometer, 2.2 m/z for Q exactive Mass Spectrometer according to our experience.\nHCD (High-energy collisional dissociation) is significantly affected by the normalized energy applied. HCD fragmentation with normalized collision energy of 33 or 32 is recommended for Orbitrap Fusion Mass Spectrometer, 27 for Q exactive Mass Spectrometer.\nThe MS2 ion count target is set to 5 × 103 and maximum injection time is 200 ms. Precursors with charge state 2–7 are selected and sampled for MS2.\nThe dynamic exclusion duration is set to 50 s with a 10 ppm tolerance around the selected precursor and its isotopes. Fixed first mass is set as 120 m/z.\nMonoisotopic precursor selection is turned on and instrument is run in top speed mode.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2142_12.csv",
    "MaxQuant analysis of Samples. All acquired raw data are searched against Drosophila melanogaster database and the common contaminant database by MaxQuant software (v1.6.5.0) (Cox et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Tyanova et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Please see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for workflow on MaxQuant detailed parameters for analysis of these data. Unless explicitly stated, parameters in MaxQuant have not been changed from their standard values.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2142-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Screenshots of MaxQuant workflow for identifying proteins\nAlong the top of MaxQuant are six tabs. Select Raw data, then click “Load” to load all raw data (step 1).\nWrite template (step 2), then a txt named “experimentalDesignTemplate” will automatically appear in the folder. Assign the experiment number (step 3) and then read the “experimentalDesignTemplate” from file (step 4).\nIn the Group-specific parameters tab, choose type as ”Standard” and the “Multiplicity” is 1 for label-free quantification (step 5). Choose “Multiplicity” 2 if you have light and heavy labels, and 3 if you have light, medium, and heavy.\nPrecursor mass tolerance is 4.5 ppm and product ions are searched at 15 ppm tolerances (steps 6 and 10).\nPeptides are generated from a tryptic digestion with up to two missed cleavages (step 7), carbamidomethylation of cysteines as fixed modifications, and oxidation of methionine as variable modifications.\nWe use LFQ with minimum ratio count of 2 to perform label-free quantification (step 8).\nOn the Global parameters tab, click “sequence” and add a FASTA file of Drosophila proteome downloaded from Uniport (step 9).\nMinimum peptide length is set at 7, while the estimated false discovery rate (FDR) threshold for peptide and protein are specified at maximum 1% (step 11).\nCritical: Perform three or four replicates for Atg8a, Atg8a-LDS mutant and wild type in order to improve the accuracy of results.\nIdentify the accumulate proteins.",
    "All result files appear in the folder “…\\combined\\txt” as tab-delimited text files. Data processing and annotation are performed by manual operation.\nOpen “ProteinGroups” with Microsoft Excel, and remove the reverse and contaminant hits (as defined in MaxQuant) from the MaxQuant output files.\nOnly protein groups identified with at least one unique peptide are used for the analysis.\nCalculate the average LFQ intensity of each protein group in each type of sample.\nThe ratio is calculated by dividing the average value of LFQ intensity of Atg8a, Atg8a LDS mutant sample by average value of LFQ intensity of wild type sample (Atg8a/ wild type, Atg8a LDS/ wild type).\nProtein groups are assigned a probability value (p-value) using a two-sample Student’s T-Test.\nProteins are considered significant if the p-value < 0.05 and had a more than two-fold change in protein expression."
