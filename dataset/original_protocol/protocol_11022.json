    "NOTE: The ovarian cancer cell line, OVCAR3, was used in these steps, but this protocol is broadly applicable to multiple other cell lines, including those derived from non-ovarian sources. A schematic of the protocol is shown in Figure 2.\n1. Plating the cells\nMake poly-L-lysine coated coverslips.\n\t\nAdd autoclaved 12 mm diameter coverslips to a 50 mL conical tube with poly-L-lysine solution, and place on a rocker for 15 min.\nAspirate the solution in a tissue culture hood. Wash the coverslips by adding sterile water, and place the tube containing the coverslips back on the rocker for 5 min. Repeat this wash step three times.\nSpread the coated coverslips on a sterile dish, and aspirate any remaining water. Let the coverslips dry in the tissue culture hood for 1 h or until no water droplets remain. Once dry, seal the dish with parafilm, and place at 4 °C.\nPlace one poly-L-lysine-coated coverslip in each well of a 24-well plate. The use of poly-lysine coverslips is critical to prevent the detachment of the cells from the coverslips during the pre-extraction step.\nTrypsinize OVCAR3 cells once they reach 70%-80% confluency.\n\t\nTo trypsinize a 10 cm culture dish that is 70%-80% confluent, aspirate the medium from the plate, and wash with 5-7 mL of PBS.\nAspirate the PBS, add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin, and place the dish in a 37 °C incubator for 8-10 min, or until cells lift off from the bottom of the plate.\nCollect the cells with 5-10 mL of medium, and add to a conical tube.\nCount the cells manually with a hemocytometer using standard procedures.",
    "Make a dilution of 25,000 cells/mL, and add 1 mL of the cells on poly-L-lysine coverslips placed in the wells of 24-well plates. For any other cell line, determine a number such that the cells are about 70%-80% confluent after three population doublings.\nGrow the cells in the culture medium under standard conditions.\n2. Pulsing cells with IdU\nFor the cells to properly spread onto the coverslips, one population doubling is enough. After one population doubling, pulse the cells with 10 µM 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (IdU) (see Table of Materials on how to reconstitute IdU) for the two subsequent population doublings.\n\tNOTE: We have tried different thymidine analogs, including bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), 5-chloro-2′-deoxyuridine (CIdU), and IdU. Amongst the three analogs, IdU gives the best signal-to-noise ratio. Comparative images of cells pulsed with the three different analogs are shown in Figure 3. We recommend the use of two negative controls: (i) a no IdU pulsed sample, and (ii) a no primary antibody control. If the formation of ssDNA needs to be assessed due to a given treatment, we recommend adding the drug after the first round of IdU doubling.\nAfter pulsing with IdU for two population doublings, harvest the cells for imaging.\n\t\nReplace the medium with ice-cold 0.5% PBSTx (PBS + 0.5% Triton X-100) on ice for 5 min. This pre-extraction step helps to release cytoplasmic and non-chromatin-bound proteins, leaving chromatin-bound proteins intact. Certain cell lines can easily peel off during pre-extraction. In such a scenario one can use 0.5% CSK buffer (10 mM PIPES (pH 6.8),100 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA and 0.5% Triton X-100).\n3. Fixation",
    "Aspirate PBSTx, and incubate for 15 min with 3% PFA (Table of Materials) at room temperature, followed by three to four washes with 1x PBS. The fixed cells can be kept at 4 °C until further steps.\n\t​CAUTION: PFA is highly toxic and carcinogenic. Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and mucous membranes. Perform all the steps with PFA in a fume hood, and dispose of the materials properly.\n4. Permeabilization and blocking\nAfter fixation, permeabilize the cells using 0.5% PBSTx on ice for 5 min. Use enough volume to cover the entire coverslip (typically between 500 µL and 1 mL).\nWash the cells three to four times with 0.2% PBST (1X PBS + 0.2% Tween-20) at room temperature. One mL of PBST is enough for washing each well. Perform the washes back to back without any incubations.\nAspirate the PBST, and block the samples using 5% BSA (Table of Materials) made in 1x PBS (blocking buffer) for 30 min at room temperature.\n5. Immunostaining with the IdU antibody\nFor immunostaining, prepare a humidified chamber (wet paper towel on a flat-bottom Tupperware). Cover the lid of the 24-well plate with parafilm, place in the humidified chamber, and lay down the coverslips on the plate lid.\nPrepare the anti-BrdU primary mouse antibody (Table of Materials) by diluting it 1:200 in the blocking buffer from step 4.2.The anti-BrdU antibody has previously been shown to detect IdU.\nAdd 60 µL of IdU antibody dilution on the top of the coverslips. Incubate the coverslips for 1 h at 37 °C.\n\t\nAlternatively, use less antibody solution if the coverslips are flipped onto a drop (20-25 µL) of 1:200 antibody dilution pipetted onto parafilm. This also decreases the likelihood of the solution drying out during the incubation.",
    "After the 1 h incubation, aspirate the primary antibody. Return the coverslips back to a 24-well plate, and wash them four times with 0.2% PBST.\nFor the secondary antibody, use the same humidified chamber described in step 5.1. Dilute anti-mouse conjugated secondary antibody (Table of Materials) in the blocking buffer (1:200). Add 60 µL of secondary antibody to the coverslips, and incubate at room temperature in the dark for 1 h.This secondary antibody is light-sensitive.\nAspirate the secondary antibody. Return the coverslips back to the 24-well plate, and wash four times with 0.2% PBST.\nLabel microscope slides, and mount the coverslips on the slides with DAPI mounting medium (Table of Materials). Store slides in the dark at room temperature for 24 h. The 24 h incubation is recommended if the mounting medium needs to be cured or hardened.\n\tNOTE: The slides can then be stored in 4 °C before being imaged on a fluorescence microscope. A representative image is shown in Figure 4.\n6. Automated quantification of IdU foci\nNOTE: The power of this assay lies in the ability to automate the analysis for quick and efficient quantification. We present here an automated analysis pipeline that can be used to quantify IdU foci in a given image field. It is important that all the images within a given experiment are taken with the same exposure settings; otherwise, the quantification will not be reliable. It may also be valuable to include a non-stained control as a negative control, at least for the first time this experiment is run (Figure 5). The protocol below is specific for NIS General Analysis Software, but the same principles can be applied with other commercial software as well.",
    "In the View tab, go to Analysis Controls | Analysis Explorer. This opens a new side window called Analysis Explorer. Click on Create New | General Analysis 3. This opens the Analysis Explorer flowchart creation software.\nGo to the Sources tab, and drag the Channels command from the left menu into the working area. The two channels for the DAPI and IdU foci will automatically pop up as binary boxes (shown in Figure 5 as boxes with red outlines).\nGo to the Preprocessing tab, and drag the Local Contrast command from the left menu to the working area. Connect the Local Contrast with the IdU foci channel. From the Segmentation tab, drag the Threshold command (one for each channel).\nConnect each channel to a Threshold command. To eliminate any nuclei at the border of an image, go to the Binary Processing tab, drag the Touching Borders command, and connect to the DAPI threshold.\nMerge the data from the two channels by using the Aggregate Children command in the Measurement tab. Define the DAPI channel as Parent (A) and the foci channel as Child (B). In the dropdown menu in the Aggregate Children command, select the option child is inside the parent. This step helps to count the number of foci (child) per nucleus (parent).\n\t\nTo export the data in a tabular format, click on the Modify Columns command in the Data Management tab. In the dropdown menu from the Modify Columns command, select DAPI-ID (this helps to assign a unique number to each nucleus within a given image) and IdU count (this provides the number of IdU foci in each nucleus). To export the data in a CSV format, use the Table To CSV command in the Reference tab. The GA3 can now be saved with a descriptive title.",
    "For the analysis, open an image in the software.\n\t\nOpen the Analysis Explorer tab as was done in step 6.1, and locate the newly made GA3. Double-click on the GA3 file, which opens a new window called GA3 Wizard where one can set the threshold for the DAPI and the IdU channels.\nUse the slider in the window to set the minimum and maximum threshold for each channel and, hence, define the signal. A good thresholding value is where the boundaries for each nucleus and IdU focus are clearly defined. Once satisfied with threshold values, retain these numbers for analyzing all the files in a given experiment.\nClick on the Run button to obtain the count of IdU foci/per nucleus.\n\t\tNOTE: The software generates a table of foci per nucleus, which can thereafter be used for any graphing purposes (Figure 5).\nSubscription Required.
