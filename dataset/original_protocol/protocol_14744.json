    "Ethics statement: All animal procedures were carried out in strict accordance with good animal practice as defined in the guidelines provided in the Guide for the Use and Care of Laboratory Animals: Eighth Edition from the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research (ILAR, 2011) and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Michigan (PRO0001553).\n1. Mouse Surgical Procedures\nNOTE: Use 8-10 week old C57BL/6 mice. Other ages, backgrounds, and strains of mice can also be used to test different conditions or genetic make-up. For the tenotomy portion of the procedure, maintain sterile conditions by using face mask, hair bonnet, and sterile gown, gloves, and instruments. Surgical sites should be sterilely prepared with povidone-iodine and sterile draping. Avoid hypothermia by using a veterinary heating pad and warming resuscitation solutions to 37 °C prior to administration.\nAnesthetize the mouse using 2.5% inhaled isoflurane. Use a nose cone to leave the dorsum and hind-limbs easily accessible. Adjust the rate of isoflurane administration to maintain appropriate respiratory rate and coloration of mucous membranes and to ensure anesthesia by checking muscle tone, toe pinch, and corneal reflex. Apply bland ophthalmic ointment to the mouse’s eyes to prevent dry eye injury during the procedure. Maintain adequate body temperature using a veterinary heating pad or warm water circulator beneath the surgical field.\nAdminister buprenorphine, 0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneously immediately prior to surgery for analgesia.\nClosely shave the surgical site on the left hind paw using clippers from the heel to the knee.\nClosely shave the dorsum of the mouse, beginning over the spine and extending the shaved area to the left of the dorsal midline, clearing an area at least 2 cm x 3 cm to accommodate the burn injury.",
    "Prepare the surgical site, including the hind paw to the knee using 3 alternating povidone-iodine scrubs.\nPerform a longitudinal incision along the medial aspect of the left Achilles tendon. Extend the incision so the Achilles tendon can be easily visualized; approximately 0.5 cm.\nPerform an Achilles tenotomy with sharp dissection of the tendon at the midpoint with sharp tissue scissors. Insert one blade of the tissue scissors in the tissue plane beneath the tendon and dissect along the plane until the blade is at the tendon midpoint. Close the scissor blades to sever the tendon sharply.\n\tNOTE: Ensure inclusion of all posterior tendons including Gastrocnemius, Soleus, and Plantaris tendons.\nAchieve hemostasis by applying pressure with sterile gauze (there should be minimal bleeding) and close the skin incision with a 5-0 vicryl stitch.\nPerform the dorsal partial thickness burn with an aluminum block weighing 35 g with approximate measurements 2 cm x 2 cm x 3 cm heated to 60 °C in a water bath applied to the shaved dorsum of the mouse for 17 sec.\n\tNOTE: Achieve the appropriate burn depth by resting the block on top of the anesthetized mouse, ensuring that the entire surface area of the block is in contact with the mouse, however avoid applying any additional pressure to the block, i.e., allow gravity to be the only force holding the block in place. A thin plastic handle attached to one side of the block is convenient for manipulation, stabilization, and retrieval from the hot water bath. This will create an approximately 30% total body surface area burn in an 8-10 week old C57BL/6 mouse. This contact burn was chosen over other methods (flame or scald burn) due to the uniformity of burn depth over the wound and the reproducibility between animals.",
    "Dry the burn site with gauze and apply a tegaderm dressing.\nAdminister warmed resuscitation fluids: Lactated Ringer’s solution 1 ml intraperitoneal injection and 0.5 ml subcutaneous injection. This one-time administration of resuscitation is adequate for recovery from the burn injury and tenotomy.\n\tNOTE: Do not return anesthetized mice to housing cages with other mice, house individually in clean cages under monitoring until mice are fully recovered. Typical recovery occurs within 1-6 hr. Burn sites generally heal within 2-4 weeks and are rarely complicated by wound infection if kept in clean housing environments.\nAdminister Buprenorphine 0.1 mg/kg subcutaneous injection every 12 hr for 3 days following the procedure. Monitor HO growth with serial µCT scans at appropriate intervals. Ectopic bone growth is first evident around 3 weeks post-op by µCT.\n\tNOTE: The majority of HO development is complete by 9 weeks post-op. We have not observed a difference in HO volume or location with repeated µCT scans bi-weekly for 15 weeks compared to a single end-point µCT scan at 15 weeks. At the end of the experiments, euthanize all mice with CO2 inhalation according to institutional guidelines and verify death with cervical dislocation after 10 min.\n2. µCT Acquisition and Analysis\nSecure the anesthetized mouse on the scanner bed in the prone position. Tape the hind limbs securely to the bed to prevent breathing motion artifact. Include the air, water, and hydroxyapatite containing phantom beneath the mouse for image calibration.\nOpen the Bone Analysis software and define a region of interest (ROI) that encompasses both hind limbs from the hip joint proximally to the tip of the hind paw distally. Obtain an image using the following parameters: 80 kV, 500 µA and 1,300 msec exposure, 48 µm voxel size.14,15",
    "Calibrate the image to Hounsfield units (HU) by drawing a ROI in each of the three phantom chambers and inputting the average density into the appropriate fields in the software.\nUsing the “grabber” tool in the software, re-orient the image so the tibia of the left hind limb is parallel along the Z axis to allow the clearest anatomical view for the delineation of orthotopic cortical bone structures and HO.\nBeginning at the knee, scroll distally through the image slices until HO is encountered. Using the manual spline tool, make an ROI around the ectopic bone on every 5th slice continuing distally through the paw or until HO has been surpassed. Use the extrapolate tool to extend and stitch the ROIs together into one ROI that contains all the HO.\nMake a 3D ROI and choose the analysis menu. Calculate the bone volume by setting the lower and upper threshold values that best show the bone window. Use the same fixed threshold values for all scans.\nSubscription Required.
