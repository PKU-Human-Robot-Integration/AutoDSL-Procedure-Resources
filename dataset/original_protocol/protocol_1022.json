    "Procedure\nConstruction of AAV vectors\ncrRNA expression vector design and construction\n1. Identify genes for knockout by targeted delivery of HDR template. Here we chose TRAC and PDCD1, but note that any gene with a Cpf1 PAM sequence may be targeted.\n  2. Design LbCpf1 crRNA \\(20bp) with Benchling or other computational pipelines.\n  crTRAC: GAGTCTCTCAGCTGGTACAC \ncrPDCD1:  GCACGAAGCTCTCCGATGTG\n3. Synthesize oligonucleotides with two LbCpf1 direct repeat and sticky ends.\n  4. Digest pXD017 with FD BbsI and insert guide after U6 promoter \\(pXD017-39).\n  \nCAR sequence generation\n1.

The sequence of CD19 binding scFv \\(FMC63) was found from NCBI \\(GenBank: HM852952) and followed by CD8 hinge-transmembrane-regions linked to 4-1BB \\(CD137) intracellular domains and CD3ζ intracellular domain 12. In order to detect CD19BBz CAR in different way, the Flag-tag sequence \\(GATTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAG) was added after the CD8⍺ leader sequence.\n  3.   Synthesize m971-BBz and FMC63-BBz using gBlock \\(IDT).\n  \nHDR template design\n1.

Isolate aqueous layer and concentrate through a 100-kDa MWCO. Critical step: concentrate AAV at high concentration so the volume can be reduced when performing the infection, which can decrease the toxicity of AAV. AAV should be aliquoted and stored at -80℃.\n  12. Titer virus by qPCR using custom Taqman assays \\(ThermoFisher) targeted to promoter U6.\n  \nT cell electroporation\n1. Human primary peripheral blood CD4+ T cells were acquired from healthy donors \\(STEMCELL technologies).

    "HDR quantification \n1. Map reads to possible amplicons based on primer combinations and HDR status.\n  2. Define \"informative\" amplicons as truncated so that 100bp reads would have at least 20bp homology with the CAR sequence \\(or with the other TRAC arm, in the case of wild-type sequences). Informative reads can be used to distinguish wild-type, NHEJ and HDR reads with higher confidence.\n  3. Map paired reads to amplicon sequences using BWA-MEM with -M flag to generate SAM files.\n  4. Use SAMtools to convert SAM files to BAM, sort, index, and generate summary statistics of read counts with the idxstats option.\n  5. To quantify wild-type vs NHEJ reads, take reads that mapped to “info_nonHDR” sequence \\(described below), and call reads with indels \\(I\" or \"D\" characters within the CIGAR string) as NHEJ. Otherwise call reads as wild-type.\n  6. Pool read counts for downstream analysis. \n  7. Schema for our amplicon sequences and quantifications provided below:\n  \namplicon_nonHDR: refers to full amplicon from F1 and R1 of genomic, wild-type DNA.\namplicon_CAR_F1: refers to full amplicon from F1 and R1 of expected, integrated CAR.\namplicon_CAR_F2: refers to full amplicon from F2 \\(primer site within the CAR as opposed to outside) and R1 of expected, integrated CAR.\ninfo_nonHDR same as amplicon_nonHDR, except truncated to 80bp of the TRAC arms.\ninfo_CAR_F1: same as amplicon_CAR_F1, except truncated to 80bp of the TRAC arms flanking the TRAC-CAR interface.\ninfo_CAR_F2: same as amplicon_CAR_F2, except truncated to 80bp of the TRAC arms flanking the TRAC-CAR interface \\(relevant to the right arm only, since F2 is within the CAR sequence). \nHDR, NHEJ, and WT scores were calculated as follows:\ninfo_nonHDR = info_WT + info_NHEJ\nhdr_score = info_CAR_F2/\\(info_CAR_F2+info_nonHDR)\nwt_score = info_WT/\\(info_CAR_F2+info_nonHDR)\nnhej_score = info_NHEJ/\\(info_CAR_F2+info_nonHDR)\nCo-culture functional assays\nStable cell line generation\n1.
