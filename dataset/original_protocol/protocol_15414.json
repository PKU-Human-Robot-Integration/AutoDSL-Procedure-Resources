    "1. Setup\nA temperature controlled exam room equipped with an infrared camera and a PC for infrared image acquisition and storage as well as a data acquisition card connected to a computer are shown in Fig.1a. \nThe room temperature and skin surface temperature are monitored by thermocouples attached to a data acquisition card during the patient study and measurement data are stored on the computer.\n2. Image Acquisition\nSince the lesion cannot be detected in the thermal image without the cooling effect, a square adhesive marker is used to localize the pigmented lesion of interest and its surroundings (Fig. 1b).\nWe acquire a bright light image of the pigmented lesion and the adhesive window with a digital camera (Canon PowerShot G11) (Fig. 1b).\nA dermatoscope connected to a digital camera (DermLite Foto System) is used to capture the polarized light image. \nWe acquire a steady state infrared image with a Merlin midwave (3-5 μm) infrared camera shown in Fig.1a, c. \nWe apply a stream of cold air to the area of the patient’s skin containing the lesion as well as a 50 mm diameter surrounding region for the duration of one minute. \nAfter one minute, we remove this cooling stress to allow the skin to re-warm at room temperature within 3-4 minutes (thermal recovery phase) (Fig. 1c-d). \nDuring the thermal recovery phase, infrared images of the pigmented lesion are captured every 2 seconds (Fig. 1c-d). \nAll IR images (in addition to the white light and polarized light images) taken during the study are saved and stored using the Labview software.\n3. Image Processing\nThe IR images are analyzed using a dedicated Matlab code in order to obtain accurate transient temperature distributions on the skin surface. For this purpose, we introduce several calibration steps and a multimodal image analysis system.",
    "We start with applying a landmark detection algorithm to the bright light image for localizing the corners of the adhesive marker. Next, we identified the corresponding points in the reference IR image. \nIn order to compensate for involuntary body/limb movement of the patient, we use these points as landmarks in a quadratic motion model for aligning the IR image sequence during the recovery phase. \nWe use the random walker, an interactive image segmentation algorithm where the user can spatially guide the segmentation by placing seed points, to create a mask image delineating the lesion. \nOnce we determine the shape of the lesion, we identify the corresponding region in each of the registered IR images.\nWe select random points inside the lesion and away from the lesion representing the lesion and the healthy tissue, respectively.\nWe compare the transient thermal response of healthy skin and the response of the lesion.\nWe prepare a table showing all the data: digital, dermoscopy, color-coded IR images of the lesion and surrounding area recorded at ambient conditions and 2 seconds after the cooling excitation, and the transient thermal response of the lesion and the healthy tissue.\n4.
