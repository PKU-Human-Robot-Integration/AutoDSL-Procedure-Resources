    "For routine growth and maintenance of C. elegans, see Wormbook chapter Maintenance of C. elegans (Stiernagle, 2006). Maintain C. elegans strains to be used in the assay in plates without contamination.Prepare fresh 35 mm Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) plates (see Recipes) containing 3 ml media, at least one day before the assay and store at 4 °C until use.Seed regular 60 mm NGM agar plates for routine maintenance with 15 μl E. coli OP50 under sterile conditions in a bacterial hood two days before the assay. Allow the plates to dry at room temperature.Place about 20-30 L4 stage wild-type (WT), N2, and mutant strains of interest using a pick made of platinum wire (described in Stiernagle, 2006) onto the 60 mm NGM plates seeded with E. coli OP50 and allow the worms to grow at 20 °C for about 20 h.On the day of assay, take out 35 mm NGM plates from 4 °C and allow them to attain room temperature. Pipette 300 μl of 100 mg/ml PTZ stock solution at the center of the plate and spread it uniformly over the entire NGM surface to obtain a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. Allow the plates to dry for 35 min with lids closed. Keep the same number of 35 mm NGM plates without PTZ to be used as control in the experiment. Spread 300 μl of Ethanol on control plates to avoid behavioral changes due to exposure of ethanol. Once the plates are dried, put a 10 μl drop of concentrated E. coli OP50 (overnight culture concentrated by centrifugation) at the center of the plate and let it dry for at least 2 h at room temperature. The plates are now ready for the assay.",
    "Transfer 10-15 worms of each genotype from Step 4 onto the center of the plate on food on both the control and PTZ-containing plates. Leave the plates undisturbed for 30 min at room temperature (~23 °C).Observe the C. elegans after the 30 min interval. Count the total number of animals on the plate and the number of C. elegans showing anterior convulsions or ‘head bobs’ (Figure 2A). Wild type C. elegans shows no response to PTZ exposure (S1 movie in Thapliyal et al., 2018). While mutant defective in GABAergic synaptic transmission show high degree of convulsions (S2 movie in Thapliyal et al., 2018). One can also observe the C. elegans after a 60 min interval to take the second reading (optional). These recordings are also done at room temperature (~23 °C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180830/20180830023902_9857.jpgFigure 2. casy-1 mutants show increased convulsions when compared with WT C. elegans. The casy-1 mutants show higher sensitivity to the GABA receptor antagonist PTZ when compared to WT animals. A. Representative still frame images demonstrating casy-1 mutant C. elegans with anterior convulsions (head bobs) and tail shrinker phenotype. The still frame images are representative frames from movies (7 frames/sec). B. The graph shows the fraction of animals showing anterior ‘head bobs’ after 30 min and 60 min exposure to 10 mg/ml PTZ. The sensitivity to PTZ could be fully rescued by expressing casy-1 isoforms in GABAergic neurons but not in cholinergic neurons or muscle. Assays were done (~15 C. elegans/assay) at least thrice. Values that differ significantly from WT animals are indicated (*** indicates P < 0.0001 using two-way ANOVA). Data are represented as mean ± S.E.M. Part of Figure 2A and Figure 2B have been previously published in (Thapliyal et al., 2018).",
    "Here in the present example, casy-1 represents a cell adhesion molecule that has been reported to regulate vesicle trafficking in GABAergic motor neurons (Thapliyal et al., 2018). GABA release from the presynaptic terminals is reduced in casy-1 mutants which can be easily interpreted from high degree of convulsions in the mutant upon PTZ exposure."
