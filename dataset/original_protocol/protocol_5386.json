    "The manipulation of cells for the SA-β-gal staining assay may be performed in a 24-well plate format. Prepare each sample in triplicate.At 120 h post-transfection or after the cell manipulation, aspirate the cell culture medium and wash the cells with PBS (500 μl per well) twice, using a p1000 pipette. After the last rinse, replace the PBS with 250 μl of 4% PFA for fixation.Incubate the cells for 5 min at room temperature.Aspirate the 4% PFA and wash the cells two times for 5 min each at room temperature with gentle shaking with 500 μl PBS.Add 250 μl SA-β-gal staining solution to each well. Incubate the cells in the dark in a 37 °C incubator. Terminate the reactions when the cells are stained blue-green, as visualized under an inverted bright-field microscope. To terminate the reaction, aspirate the staining solution and replace with distilled water.Wash the cells a second time in distilled water.After the last wash add 500 μl of distilled water to each well and observe the plate under an inverted bright-field microscope.Capture images of cells in each well using a 10x objective.Images may be printed for counting the total cell number, or count the stained cells on a computer monitor, which may give better distinction between the unstained and stained cells. Represent the SA-β-gal positive cells as a percentage of the total cell number.Note: A trial may need to be carried out to determine the optimal length of incubation with SA-β-gal staining solution for each of the cell lines to be studied. Cells may be observed every 4 h during the first 12 h, and subsequently every 12 h. For example, the optimal incubation period in our hands was determined based on the visibility of the stained cells in test samples (e.g.",
    "PAX8siRNA treated samples) but not in the control samples (i.e. untreated sample or/and control siRNA treated sample). It is important to remember that the detection principle of this assay is based on the cellular abundance of the lysosomal β-galactosidase, which varies between cell lines. A table showing the length of optimal incubation time for several cell lines in our hands is as follows (Table 1).  Table 1.

Bright-field images show SA-β-gal positivecells in blue-green (insets). The colors of the images were inverted usingAdobe Photoshop (version 10.0) to aid the visibility of the positive (pink) cells. SA-β-gal positive cells were undetectable (or at a very low frequency) in control siRNA(SN) treated samples (highest detection was 3%, in TK-10 cells, Figure 1B). In comparison, adistinct elevation of SA-β-gal positive cells was observed in all PAX8 siRNA (S8) treated samples (highestdetection was 38%, in TK-10 cells).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171228/20171228224156_1940.jpgFigure 1.
