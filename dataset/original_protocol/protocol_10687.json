    "1. Assembly of Probe to Stiffener\n\tThis section of the protocol describes fabrication of a silicon stiffener, and the assembly of a thin-film polymer probe to the stiffener. Figure 1 illustrates a typical polymer neural probe along with the proposed stiffener. The details of the stiffener design are shown in Figure 2. The novel feature of this design is the shallow \"wicking\" channel running along its length which is used to distribute liquid adhesive during assembly. The wider portion of the stiffener is a tab for handling during assembly and surgical insertion. A reservoir on the tab connects to the channel. The component is fabricated from silicon using standard microfabrication processes.\n\t\tThe silicon stiffener with a wicking channel was fabricated from a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer with a device layer thickness equal to the desired thickness of the stiffener (Figure 3A). A reasonable range of stiffener thickness is 20-100 μm. It is recommended that the width of the stiffener be 20-30 μm smaller than the probe width, which helps to prevent overflow of the adhesive from the bond interface to the top of the probe. First the wicking channels are dry-etched using the standard Bosch process (Figure 3B). Next, the stiffener geometry is defined by a longer etch that stops on the buried oxide layer (Figure 3C). Finally, the stiffeners are released by wet-etching the buried oxide layer in 49% hydrofluoric acid (Figure 3D). After thoroughly rinsing the stiffeners, soak them in deionized water for 15 min.\n\t\tPlace a pellet of polyethylene glycol (PEG) of molecular weight 10,000 g/mol into the reservoir (Figure 4). Heat the stiffener to 65 °C so that the PEG melts and wicks into the channel by capillary action. Then cool to room temperature to solidify.",
    "Figure 5 shows a schematic of the flip chip bonder set up. Place the stiffener upside down on the base stage of the flip chip bonder, then pick up the stiffener with the tool head. Place the probe upside down on the base stage. Using the flip chip bonder, align the stiffener and the probe and then lower the stiffener and place it onto the probe.\n\t\tThe base stage of the flip chip bonder should have a heating element to apply heat to the substrate. After placing the stiffener, heat the assembly once again to 65 °C. Allow one minute for the PEG to remelt and begin to fill in the interface between the probe and stiffener. Cool to solidify.\n\t\tTurn the assembly over and inspect from the top. Reheat as needed to allow the PEG to completely fill the interface between the probe and the stiffener. This can be visually evaluated since the probe is transparent. As the assembly is sitting on the heater top- (probe-) side up, manually place 1-3 extra pellets of solid PEG onto the tab so that they melt over the probe, providing additional reinforcement in this region (Figure 6). Finally, allow the assembly to cool so that the PEG solidifies. At this point, the assembly is ready for surgical insertion.\n\t2. Insertion and Extraction\n\t\tMount the probe-stiffener assembly to a micromanipulator as illustrated in Figure 7A by adhering the back of the stiffener to the micromanipulator arm at the tab region. This may be done with double-sided tape or cement, but take care not to contact the probe with adhesive. Temporarily secure the connector end of the probe to the micromanipulator with a small piece of adhesive putty such that it can be easily removed with low force.",
    "Position the probe assembly over the target and insert the probe with the desired insertion speed. Insertion speeds of 0.13-0.5 mm/sec were used when developing this protocol.\n\t\tImmediately remove the connector end of the probe from the micromanipulator gently and rest it on a nearby surface, such as a second manipulator arm (Figure 7B). This must be done before the PEG begins to dissolve to avoid displacing the probe.\n\t\tAllow time for PEG to dissolve. This amount of time will depend on PEG molecular weight and area of contact between the probe and stiffener. For example, with PEG molecular weight of 10,000 g/mol, a microelectrode probe about 6 mm and a matching stiffener that is 306 μm wide, 15 min has been found to be an adequate amount of time. Section 3 of the protocol presents a method to test the required dissolution time. During this time, apply phosphate buffered saline (PBS) using a dropper around the tab and insertion point to dissolve any PEG that is above the target (Figure 7C).\n\t\tUsing a motorized micropositioner, begin extraction of the stiffener by applying a displacement of 100 μm at a speed of 5 mm/sec. This initial fast motion helps to overcome any static friction and minimize probe displacement. Then, complete the stiffener extraction at a slower speed of approximately 0.1 mm/second (Figure 7D).\n\t\tIn the case of an actual surgery, continue with normal procedures to apply gel, silicone, and/or dental acrylic at the insertion site to secure and protect the probe, as demonstrated in 21.\n\t3. Agarose Gel Test",
    "This section of the protocol describes a set up and procedure to examine the extraction of the stiffener in a 0.6% agarose gel that approximates the bulk mechanical properties, pH, and salinity of brain tissue 17,22. Since the gel is nearly transparent through short distances, stiffener separation and probe displacement can be observed.\n\t\tPrepare a solution of 0.6% agarose in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Mix at an elevated temperature to completely dissolve the agarose powder. Pour the solution into a shallow acrylic box; gel should be 3/4- 1 in deep. Allow to the gel set at room temperature for an hour.\n\t\tEnsure that the hardened gel is saturated with PBS so that it does not dry out, and heat the gel to 37 °C.\n\t\tSet up the micromanipulator, box of agarose gel, and microscopic camera system as shown in Figure 8.\n\t\tInsert a glass reference fiducial into the box of gel by sliding it between the gel and the side of the box (Figure 8). Use a dental pick to square the features on the reference fiducial to the field of view of the digital microscope.\nMount the probe assembly to the micromanipulator as described in step 2.1.\nPosition the probe assembly over the gel about 1 mm behind the reference fiducial.\nInsert the probe into the gel, using the camera to guide it to a desired depth in the field of view.\nImmediately move the connector end of the probe to rest on a nearby surface.\n\t\tMake any required adjustments to the camera image to focus on the probe (the reference fiducial features may be slightly out of focus). Take a snapshot of the probe location.",
    "Allow PEG to dissolve (this time may vary, and in fact may be a parameter to be tested). Apply PBS near the tab to dissolve PEG that is above the gel.\n\t\tStart video capture if desired, and begin extraction of the stiffener as described in step 2.5. When extraction is complete, take a final snapshot of probe location.\n\t\tUse image processing tools to compare the images before and after stiffener extraction. Use the features on the reference fiducial that are visible in the field of view to register (align) the images. Calibrate the scale of the image based on the size of known features on the probe. Measure the distance of probe displacement.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
