    "Prepare PEI solution (see Recipes) as 10 mg/ml in water.Note: Other transfection methods can be used as well, PEI is used here due to being inexpensive and showing good transfection efficiency.Cultivate HeLa or HEK293T cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until 70-80% confluent.Trypsinize cells and seed 2 x 104 cells into each well of a PerkinElmer Viewplate using a multi-channel pipette (total volume of 50 µl). Include wells for negative and positive controls (see Note 3). For weakly adherent cells, pre-treatment with gelatin or poly-L-lysine may be required. Incubate cells overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Prepare a mix of 100 ng GFP-Grb2 plasmid DNA with 100 ng of cDNA (e.g., 3xFLAG-TACC3 as positive control or other controls, see Note 3) in DMEM (25 µl) without FBS and penicillin-streptomycin.Add PEI (10 mg/ml solution) at a ratio of 4:1, i.e., for 200 ng total DNA add 0.8 µl PEI.Vortex the DMEM/DNA/PEI-mix and leave at room temperature for 15-20 min.Add the DMEM/DNA/PEI-mix dropwise to cells using a gentle dispensing method. Note: Alternatively, the transfection mix can be dispensed first into plates and then cells added on top (reverse transfection).6 h after transfection, replace the transfection mix with fresh DMEM plus FBS/penicillin-streptomycin media.Incubate cells overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.The next day, aspirate off the media and wash the cells once with 1x PBS (see Recipes).Note: At this stage, treatments such as EGF stimulation or drug treatment can be performed before the PBS-wash, depending on the duration of the incubation (e.g., 10 min EGF, or a couple of hours of drugs).Add 50 µl of 4% PFA in PBS to each well and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.",
    "Note: The assay can also be performed on live cells, in which case steps 12 and 13 can be omitted. Here, we fixed the cells as they can be kept in PBS for a couple of days and plates can be imaged at a later time-point. Yet, live-cell imaging allows for more experimental flexibility, such as time-lapse microscopy.Aspirate off the PFA and wash once with 1x PBS.Add Hoechst 33342 (diluted 1:10,000 in 1x PBS) for 10 min.Wash cells once with 1x PBS and add 50 µl 1x PBS.Note: At this stage, plates can be stored at 4 °C until imaging, up to a couple of days.Acquire images on a suitable fluorescence microscope (e.g., Opera Phenix) with the following settings: Channel 488 nm for GFP, 100% laser power, 40x objective, binning ‘1’, exposure time may vary between 500 msec and 2 sec, depending on transfection efficiency and brightness. Figure 2 shows the settings on the Opera-high-content screening microscope. Example images (TACC3-overexpression and AMPH-overexpression compared to GFP-Grb2 only) are shown in Figure 3. Perform image analysis or qualitatively assess images by eye. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170830/20170830001343_8696.jpgFigure 2. Instrument settings for image acquisition. A screenshot of the Opera LX image acquisition page. Arrows indicate settings that can be adjusted including laser channels, cameras, plate types, objectives, laser power, filters and exposure times (from top to bottom). Other instruments vary in the layout and setup of settings.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170830/20170830001456_3958.jpgFigure 3.
