    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDifferentiation of hESCs via embryoid body formation\nTiming: 3–9 weeks\nPrior to differentiation, hESCs are first amplified on Geltrex-coated dishes for at least one passage to remove MEFs which are inhibitory of differentiation toward mesoderm and blood cells.\nExpansion of hESCs in feeder-free culture\nThaw a Geltrex aliquot on ice 10–12 h in a fridge. The following day prepare a further 1:40 dilution with cold KO-DMEM (total dilution factor from initial stock 1:200).\nDispense 1 mL of diluted Geltrex per well of a 6-well plate. Plates can be prepared in advance, sealed with parafilm, and kept in the fridge for up to one week.\nPlace the 6-well plate with Geltrex at 37°C for 15–20 min, check under the microscope that Geltrex pieces have attached, then aspirate the remaining Geltrex.\nWash gently with 1–2 mL KO-DMEM per well and add 1 mL of TeSR-E8 basal medium per well.\nOn the day of passaging, leave TeSR-E8 medium at 20°C for at least 30 min to warm up and place an aliquot of EDTA 0.5 mM solution in a 37°C water bath for at least 10 min prior to use.\nPrepare the required volume of TeSR-E8 medium, containing 10 μM ROCK inhibitor, for the number of wells in which the cells will be split, calculating 1.5 mL per well.\nCarefully remove medium from the hESC colonies and wash quickly and gently with 0.5 mL of EDTA 0.5 mM to remove any trace of medium and debris.\nAdd 1 mL of EDTA 0. 5 mM and place cells in the incubator at 37°C for 2 min. Check the colonies under microscope, the cell-cell interactions should become more relaxed and cells within the colonies should become more refringent.",
    "Carefully remove the EDTA solution without disturbing the cell layer. Let the cells dry by keeping the plate lid off for 1 min in the tissue culture hood.\nTo detach the hESCs, pipette 500 μl of TeSR-E8 medium containing ROCK inhibitor directly over the colonies, aiming to detach small clumps of 5–6 cells, avoiding making a single cell suspension (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nRepeat step j until reaching the desired volume of medium, calculating 500 μl per well in which the hESCs will be split (e.g., 2 mL of medium for a 1 in 4 split). This minimizes repeated pipetting of the cell clumps, minimizing cell death and single cell formation. Typically, hESCs are split at 1 in 6 or 1 in 8.\nDispense 500 μl of hESC clump suspension dropwise to each new well. Gently move the plate up and down, left and right to evenly distribute the cell clumps within the wells.\nCarefully transfer the plate to an incubator at 37°C 5% CO2 in normoxia to avoid gathering of all cell clumps to the middle of the wells.\nReplace medium without ROCK inhibitor after 24 h. The first passage on Geltrex may show spontaneous differentiation, more death, fewer attached clumps and more flattened morphology (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) than on feeders. Cells will recover after a few days and with further passaging on Geltrex.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/499-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. hESC colonies morphology\nRepresentative example of hESC colonies grown on Geltrex-coated dish. Scale bar, 250 μm.\nMake a stock of hESCs grown on Geltrex before beginning an experiment if needed. Use the freezing protocol below.\nFreezing hESCs grown on Geltrex\nBefore starting, warm up an aliquot of EDTA solution in a water bath at 37°C for at least 10 min.\nUse the protocol for EDTA passage.",
    "Determine the volume of freezing medium needed calculating 1 mL per cryovial. Typically, 2 cryovials can be frozen per confluent well of a 6-well plate.\nIn step j of the EDTA passage protocol, use freezing medium instead of TeSR-E8 medium.\nTransfer the cell clumps into a cryovial, then place the cryovials in an appropriate freezing container (Isopropanol-filled or similar) to ensure a gradual decrease of the temperature.\nPlace the container at −80°C.\nTransfer the cryovials to liquid nitrogen 24–48 h later.\nDifferentiation of hESCs via Embryoid Body formation Embryoid bodies (EBs) are made from hESCs grown on Geltrex when 80% confluence is reached. The formation of EBs is the first step in the differentiation process. This is best achieved by culturing small aggregates of hESCs in the presence of BMP4 for 24 h. At this stage, BMP4 promotes the survival of the hESCs. At day 0, it is important to add ROCK inhibitor to enhance survival and Geltrex to maintain a good aggregation of cells. At day 1, FGF2 is added to the EB medium then at day 2 and 4, the medium is changed.\nRemove the TeSR-E8 medium and wash quickly and gently with 1 mL of EDTA 0.5 mM per well of a 6-well plate.\nAdd 1 mL of EDTA 0.5 mM per well of a 6-well plate and incubate at 37°C for 2 min or more. The length of incubation with EDTA will depend on the cell line, so it is important to check under the microscope that the edges of the colonies are becoming refractive.\nAspirate EDTA and replace with 2 mL of IMDM 20% FBS EB harvesting medium.",
    "Cut the hESC colonies into small clumps using a StemPro EZPassage tool, cutting up and down, then rotating the plate and cutting up and down in a perpendicular orientation to the previous cut. This is performed in a laminar flow hood (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/499-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Square cutting for embryoid body seeding\nhESC colonies grown on Geltrex-coated dish and cut in small squares for embryoid body seeding using a StemPro EZPassage tool. Scale bar, 200 μm.\nCollect the clumps in a screw-cap tube, avoid making single cell suspension by pipetting too vigorously. Wash the plate thoroughly with extra medium to harvest all the clumps. A cell scraper can be used to reach the cells located at the edges of the well.\nLet the clumps settle by gravity for 20 min. If the clumps are small, they can be centrifuged for 5 min at 600 × g.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and gently add 2 mL (per well of 6-well plate) or 10 mL (per 10 cm dish) of Embryoid Body differentiation medium day 0.\nCarefully transfer the clumps to Poly-HEMA coated plates. 6 wells of a 6-well plate are needed to seed a 10 cm dish of EBs or 1 well into 1 well of a 6-well plate. Incubate at 37°C, 5% O2, 5% CO2.\nAt day 1, add 0.5 mL per well or 2 mL per 10 cm dish of EB medium day 0, containing FGF2 for a final concentration of 5 ng/mL in the total volume.",
    "At day 2, collect the EBs with a 10 mL serological pipette and let them settle by gravity for 15–20 min. Gently wash the dish with 6 mL of IMDM basal medium to collect all EBs. Resuspend in EB medium day 2. Replate the EBs in new Poly-HEMA-coated dishes or plates and incubate at 37°C 5% O2 5% CO2.\nAt day 4, collect the EBs (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]), let them settle by gravity for 15–20 min and resuspend in EB medium day 4. Replate the EBs in new Poly-HEMA-coated dishes or plates and incubate at 37°C 5% O2 5% CO2 for 2 more days.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/499-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Embryoid bodies\nRepresentative example of embryoid bodies at day 4 of differentiation. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nHemogenic endothelium isolation and culture\nHemogenic endothelium is an endothelial subset that give rise to all blood progenitors in specific culture conditions (Lacaud and Kouskoff, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). To determine the hemogenic potential of the culture, the endothelial population is isolated from EBs and further cultured in hematopoietic inducing conditions.\nIsolation of hemogenic endothelium by cell sorting\nBefore starting the protocol, warm up the TrypLE solution in a water bath at 37°C.\nCollect day 6 EBs in 50 mL screw-cap tubes and let them settle by gravity for 20 min. EBs from up to two 10 cm dishes are collected per 50 mL tube. Dishes can be washed with extra IMDM medium to ensure harvesting of all EBs. If the EBs are small, they can be centrifuged for 3 min at 400 × g.\nOnce the EBs are pelleted, carefully remove the supernatant and add 5 mL of warm TrypLE per 50 mL tube.",
    "Incubate for 3 min at 37°C in a water bath, then vortex briefly. If EB clumps are still present in the suspension, return to the water bath for 2 min.\nAdd 5 mL IMDM 10% FBS and pipette up and down to disaggregate EBs. Allow any non-disaggregated EBs to settle and pass supernatant through a pre-wet 50 μm Filcon filter (BD bioscience, cat# 340630) into 5 mL snap cap tubes (Falcon, cat# 352054).\nAdd 2 mL IMDM 10% FBS to the remaining EBs and use a 5 mL syringe with a 18G blunt needle to disaggregate the remaining clumps. Allow any non-disaggregated EBs to settle and pass supernatant through a pre-wet Filcon filter into 5 mL snapcap tubes. Repeat until all EBs are collected.\nCount cells using a hematocytometer.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 3,000 × g.\nResuspend cells in IMDM 10% FBS at 5 × 106 cells/mL and pass the cell solution through a pre-wet 50μm Filcon filter to remove any potential cell clumps. Set aside 200 μL of cell suspension for flow cytometry unstained control and single stained controls.\nStain the cell solution by adding anti-CD43, anti-CD144, and anti-CD31 antibodies directly to the cell solution. Hoechst 33258 is added as a cell live/death discriminator. The choice of fluorochromes will depend on the Flow Cytometer sorter filters and lasers settings. Stain between 20 × 106 and 50 ×106 cells to have enough cells after the sort for replating.\nIncubate for 1 h at 4°C, mixing the cell solution after 30 min by vortexing gently.\nCells are washed once with 5 mL of IMDM 10% FBS, centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 × g, the supernatant is discarded and the cells resuspended in IMDM 10% FBS at 5 × 106 cells/mL or less depending on the Flow Cytometer sorter used.",
    "Compensation settings are performed using BD CompBeads (BD Bioscience) labeled with the antibodies used for staining the cells according to the manufacturer’s instruction (https://www.bdbiosciences.com/ds/pm/tds/552843.pdf[href=https://www.bdbiosciences.com/ds/pm/tds/552843.pdf]).\nGating strategy is decided based on the unstained and single stained cell samples.\nLive cells positive for CD144 and CD31 expression and negative for CD43 expression are sorted. Typically, the frequency of CD144+CD31+CD43− is 20% to 25%.\nAfter the sort, cells are centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 × g, the supernatant is discarded and the cells resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/mL in hemogenic endothelium inducing medium.\nCells are plated on gelatin-coated plates at 120,000 cells per well of a 6-well plate for analysis at day 4 and 80,000 cells for analysis at day 7. The media does not need to be changed during this period.\nFlow cytometry analysis at day 4 and 7 of hemogenic endothelium culture\nBefore starting warm up the TrypLE solution in a water bath at 37°C.\nCollect the supernatant of the culture into a 15 mL screw-cap tube as it contains floating hematopoietic cells. The remaining attached cells which are mostly endothelial are trypsinized.\nAdd 1 mL of warm TrypLE to the well and incubate 3 min at 37°C in an incubator.\nCells are gently detached and resuspended by pipetting the TrypLE solution up and down. Cells are transferred to the tube containing the supernatant and the well is washed with 1 mL of IMDM 10% FBS\nCentrifuge the cells for 3 min at 3,000 × g, aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of FACS wash",
    "Cells are stained for hematopoietic (CD43, CD235a) and endothelial markers (KDR, CD73) (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). For each set of markers, 1 × 105 to 5 × 105 cells are stained. Unstained control is also analyzed. Compensation settings are performed using BD CompBeads (BD Bioscience) labeled with the antibodies used for staining the cells according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls should also be run to control the level of fluorescent spill over in the multicolor flow cytometry panels.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/499-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Hematopoietic and endothelial cell characterization\nFlow cytometry analysis of day 4 hemogenic culture for hematopoietic (CD43, CD235a) and endothelial (KDR, CD73) cell surface markers.\nClonogenic assay\nNote: This assay measures the number and type of hematopoietic progenitors and is performed with cells from day 4 and day 7 hemogenic inducing cultures.\nFor each assay 3.5 mL of semi-solid medium is used, enough to seed three 35 mm dishes containing 1 mL each. 0.5 mL is prepared in excess as it is impossible to recover all the methylcellulose solution from the tube.\nWarm up an aliquot of methylcellulose (MEC) at 37°C for at least 20 min.\nPrepare the required amount of semi-solid medium, adding the methylcellulose last using a 5 mL syringe with 18G blunt needle.\nDispense 3.5 mL of semi-solid medium per 15 mL snapcap tube using a 5 mL syringe with 18G blunt needle.\nAdd 3.5 × 103 to 105 cells of day 4 or day 7 hemogenic culture to each 15 mL snapcap tube containing 3.5 mL of semi-solid medium and vortex vigorously briefly to homogenously mix the cells within the methylcellulose medium then let the air bubbles settle. The added volume of cells should not exceed 10% of the final volume.",
    "Incubate for 5 min in a 37°C water bath to loosen up the methylcellulose and vortex vigorously to mix and allow the air bubbles to dissipate before dispensing.\nUsing a 1 mL syringe and 18G blunt needle, carefully distribute 1 mL of the solution per 35 mm sterile petri dish. Keep in mind it will go slowly due to the high density of this medium.\nPlace the dishes in a cell culture protective tray containing a dish with water to keep the appropriate humidity inside the tray and put in the incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2, 5% O2.\nEnsure an appropriate level of water is maintained inside the tray for two weeks\nCount the colonies after 14 days of culture.\nT lymphocyte generation The capacity to generate T lymphocytes from progenitors relies on a supportive stromal niche providing Notch signaling (Schmitt et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). To this end, cells are co-cultured on OP9 stromal cells expressing the human ligand DLL1 (obtained from the Zuniga-Pflucker group). These stroma cells are mitotically inactivated by Mitomycin C as described for the MEF above (section 15). It is advisable that these stromal cells express a fluorescence protein (GFP or similar) to exclude them in flow cytometry analysis. T cell potential is assessed either directly from sorted hemogenic cells or from cells obtained after 4 days of hemogenic inducing culture.\nOne day before starting the assay, plate a vial containing 106 mitotically inactivated OP9-hDLL1-GFP mouse stromal cells in a 12-well plate or in a 6-well plate in OP9-DLL1 medium depending on the number of cell populations to be tested.\nThe next day, check that the OP9-hDLL1 cells are healthy and homogenously distributed (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/499-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. OP9-DLL1 stroma\nRepresentative example of a confluent layer of OP9-DLL1 stroma cells. Scale bar, 100 μm.",
    "Warm up an aliquot of the OP9-DLL1 medium at 20°C.\nHemogenic endothelium sorted from day 6 EBs can be directly used in this protocol. Alternatively, cells harvested after 4 days of hemogenic inducing culture can be seeded on OP9-DLL1 stroma layer (see step 5a–d for harvesting these cells).\nThe cells to be tested for T lymphocyte potential are seeded at minimum of 104 cells per cm2 in T lymphoid generation medium containing 20 ng/mL FLT3L, 100 ng/mL SCF, 25 ng/mL IL-2 and 5 ng/mL IL-7 human cytokines.\nCells must be transferred to a fresh inactivated OP9-hDLL1 cells at day 10 and every 5 days afterwards, keeping the culture for 1 month. The stroma cells must be thawed the day before passages\nFrom day 15 onward, feed the cells with stroma medium containing 10 ng/mL FLT3L, 25 ng/mL IL-2 and 5 ng/mL IL-7 human cytokines\nTo passage the cells onto a fresh stroma cell layer, collect the supernatant into a 15 mL screw-cap tube as it contains floating hematopoietic cells.\nAdd 1 mL of warm TrypLE to the well and incubate 3 min at 37°C in an incubator.\nCells are gently detached and resuspended by pipetting the TrypLE solution up and down. Cells are transferred to the tube containing the supernatant previously collected and the well is washed with 1 mL of stroma medium and passed through a pre-wet 50μ m sterile Filcon to remove clumps of OP9 cells.\nCentrifuge the cells for 5 min at 3,000 × g and add fresh OP9-DLL1 medium containing human cytokines according to the day of culture. Each well is transferred completely to another well, maintaining the culture without diluting the cell density.",
    "After 1 month in culture, dissociate the culture as described for passaging and analyze the cells by flow cytometry for the expression of human CD45, CD8 and CD4 markers (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]). Hoechst 33258 or any other suitable live dye is used for live/dead discrimination.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/499-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. T lymphocyte characterization\n(A) T lymphocyte culture on OP9-DLL1 showing T lymphocytes (red arrows) on top of the stroma layer. Scale bar, 100 μm.\n(B) Flow cytometry staining for CD4 and CD8 cell surface markers.\nUse FMOs (fluorescent minus one), unstained sample, live single stained controls, and OP9-GFP stromal cells alone as controls for the flow cytometry data analysis.\nThe first gate must be done on the GFP negative CD45+ population to eliminate the OP9 cells that express high GFP."
