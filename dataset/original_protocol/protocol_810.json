    "**RNA FRAGMENTATION**\n1| Set up the following fragmentation reaction in a thin-walled 200 μl PCR tube. Mix well by vortex and spin down. \n<a href=http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5485/original/Supplementary_Protocol_1_03152017_table1.pdf?1492068835> <img src=http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5485/original/Supplementary_Protocol_1_03152017_table1.pdf?1492068835> </a>\n2| Incubate at 95 °C for 5 min in a pre-heated thermal cycler block with the heated lid closed. Remove tubes from block and immediately add 2 μl of stop solution. Mix well by vortex and spin down, and place on ice. \n3| Purify fragmented RNA using RNA Clean & Concentraton-5 kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Elute in 15 μl molecular biology grade, RNase-free water. Note that each RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 column is suitable for purification of up to 10 μg RNA. \n**3’ END REPAIR**\n4|Set up the following 3’ end repair reaction in a thin-walled 200 μl PCR tube. Mix well by gentle tapping and spin down. \n<a href=http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5487/original/Supplementary_Protocol_1_03152017_table2.pdf?1492068903> <img src=http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5487/original/Supplementary_Protocol_1_03152017_table2.pdf?1492068903> </a>\n5| Incubate at 37°C for 30 minutes.\n6| Purify 3’ end-repaired fragmented RNA using RNA Clean & Concentraton-5 kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Elute in 15 μl molecular biology grade, RNase-free water.\n**OXIDATION-ELIMINATION-DEPHOSPHORYLATION CYCLES** \n7|Set up the following oxidation-elimination reaction in a dark tube. Mix well by vortex and spin down. \n<a href=http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5489/original/Supplementary_Protocol_1_03152017_table3.pdf?1492068926> <img src=http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5489/original/Supplementary_Protocol_1_03152017_table3.pdf?1492068926> </a>\n8| Incubate at 37 °C for 30 minutes with shaking. \n9| Quench the reaction by adding 2 μl of ethylene glycol. Mix well and spin down. \n10| Dephosphorylate by adding 5 μl of CutSmart Buffer \\(10X), 2 μl of rSAP enzyme \\(2 units) and 1 μl of molecular biology grade, RNase-free water \\(total reaction volume of 50 μl), mix well and spin down. \n11| Incubate at 37 °C for 30 minutes with shaking.\n12| Purify RNA using RNA Clean & Concentrator-5 kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Elute in 32 μl molecular biology grade, RNase-free water.",
    "13| Repeat steps 7-12 seven more times. \n \n**FINAL OXIDATION-ELIMINATION** \n14| Repeat steps 7-9 once. Make sure not perform dephosphorylation \\(steps 10-11). \n15| Purify RNA using RNA Clean & Concentraton-5 kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Elute in 32 μl molecular biology grade, RNase-free water.\n**5’ PHOSPHORYLATION** \n16|Set up the following 5’ dephosphorylation reaction. Mix well by gentle tapping and spin down.\n<a href=http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5491/original/Supplementary_Protocol_1_03152017_table4.pdf?1492068949> <img src=http://www.nature.com/protocolexchange/system/uploads/5491/original/Supplementary_Protocol_1_03152017_table4.pdf?1492068949> </a>\n17| Incubate at 37 °C for 30 minutes.\n18| Purify RNA using RNA Clean & Concentraton-5 kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Elute in 8 μl molecular biology grade, RNase-free water.\n**LIBRARY PREPARATION FOR MASSIVELY PARALLEL SEQUENCING**\n19| Use RNA from step 18 to construct a small RNA library using NEBNext® Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina, according to the manufacturer’s instruction, with the exception that 3’ adaptor ligation should be performed  overnight at 16 °C."
