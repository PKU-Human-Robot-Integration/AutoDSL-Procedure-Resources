    "1. Nucleic acid and chemical probe preparation\nNucleic acids\n\tNOTE: The oligonucleotide named \"TBA\" is the 15-mer DNA sequence 5'-GGT-TGG-TGT-GGT-TGG-3' labeled at the 3'-end by the fluorophore 5-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) to enable visualization on the gel. The unlabeled oligonucleotide \"cTBA\" is its DNA complementary sequence 5'-CCA-ACC-ACA-CCA-ACC-3'. TBA and cTBA are employed to obtain the three different structures, as shown in Table 1.\n\t\nAutoclave tips and 0.5 mL tubes in order to obtain sterile disposables and avoid contamination.\nPrepare stock solutions solubilizing each oligonucleotide in ultrapure water to a final concentration of 100 µM. Determine the exact oligonucleotide concentration with a ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer, using the extinction coefficient at 260 nm provided by the manufacturer.\n\t\tNOTE: Extinction coefficients: 164,300 M-1 cm-1 and 138,600 M-1 cm-1 were used for TBA and cTBA, respectively.\nStore TBA and cTBA stock solutions at -20 °C (for months in these conditions).\nCompound B-CeP 1\n\tNOTE: The compound B-CeP 1 is synthesized as previously reported6.\n\t\nPrepare the B-CeP 1 stock solution at ~10 mM. Weigh ~1 mg of the lyophilized compound using an analytical balance located in a fume hood and solubilize it in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\nCalculate the exact compound concentration based on the actual amount of compound and DMSO (d = 1.1 g/cm3) used.\n\t\tNOTE: Handle the compound with gloves at all times (both when lyophilized and when dissolved in DMSO)13,14.\nTable 1: Oligonucleotide structures used in this protocol.

Folding of nucleic acid constructs\nPreparation of buffers\n\t\nPrepare a BPE buffer solution (biphosphate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA], 5x: 2 mM NaH2PO4, 6 mM Na2HPO4, 1 mM Na2EDTA, pH 7.4) and a solution of 500 mM KCl in ultrapure water. Filter the solutions through 0.22 µm pore size filters.",
    "NOTE: For best results, use freshly prepared solutions. BPE buffer can be stored at 4 °C for up to 15 days.\nFolding of G4-TBA, ssTBA, and dsTBA samples by the heat-refolding procedure\n\tNOTE: Potassium cations are necessary to fold the G4 structure (G4-TBA). Do not add potassium cations in the folding solution of the controls ssTBA and dsTBA.\n\t\nPrepare 40 µL of a 4 µM solution of G4-TBA in 1x BPE and 100 mM KCl. Denature the oligonucleotide G4-TBA solution by heating the tube to 95 °C for 5 min and slowly cool it down to room temperature (RT) to allow the TBA to fold into G-quadruplexes.\nPrepare 40 µL of a 4 µM solution of ssTBA in 1x BPE. Perform the heat-refolding procedure, as mentioned in step 2.2.1, to fold TBA in its single-stranded form.\nPrepare 40 µL of a 4 µM solution of dsTBA by mixing equimolar amounts of TBA and cTBA in 1x BPE. Perform the heat-refolding procedure as mentioned above (step 2.2.1) for TBA to anneal to its complementary sequence cTBA and form the double-stranded form of TBA.\n\t\tNOTE: The final volume of each folding solution is based on the number of samples for the probing reactions, considering that 5 µL of 4 µM solution will be needed for each sample. Prepare a little excess volume of each solution to avoid pipetting errors.\n3. Probing reactions\nNOTE: Probing reactions must be done immediately after the heat-refolding procedure.\nWhen the folding solutions of G4-TBA, ssTBA, and dsTBA have cooled to RT, perform a short-spin centrifugation (7,000 × g for 5-8 s at RT) and start the probing reactions.\nPrepare 21 empty 0.5 mL autoclaved tubes. Organize them in three sets of seven tubes each in the rack for lab samples, as reported in Table 2.",
    "NOTE: Each column set corresponds to the three different TBA folding conditions G4-TBA, ssTBA, and dsTBA. Each row corresponds to three different incubation times. Each cell within the column corresponds to the final B-CeP 1 probe concentration (Table 2). Make sure to clearly label the tubes.\nAdd 3 µL of ultrapure water in each tube.\nAdd 5 µL of folded G4-TBA in each tube of the first set (step 3.2). Add 5 µL of folded ssTBA in each tube of the second set. Add 5 µL of folded dsTBA in each tube of the third set.\nDilute the B-CeP 1 stock solution to 250 µM and 25 µM in ultrapure water.\n\tNOTE: Dilutions of the B-CeP 1 chemical probe must be freshly prepared and immediately reacted with the DNA substrate to avoid competing reactions with water.\nAdd 2 µL of the appropriate B-CeP 1 dilution (25 µM and 250 µM) to the samples. Replace the compound with ultrapure water in the three control samples (C) for analysis of the differently folded TBAs in the absence of the compound. Incubate all the samples at 37 °C.\nAfter 1 h, 4 h, and 15 h of incubation, stop the reaction by placing the tubes at -20 °C until the next step.\n\tNOTE: The samples can be stored in these conditions for a couple of days.\nDry the samples in a vacuum centrifuge.\n\tNOTE: The dried samples can be stored at -20 °C for weeks before proceeding with the PAGE analysis.",
    "Table 2: Samples for the probing reactions (structures, probe concentrations, and incubation time). Each column set corresponds to the three different TBA folding conditions (G4-TBA, ssTBA, and dsTBA). Each row corresponds to three different incubation times (1, 4, 15 h). Each cell within the column corresponds to the final B-CeP 1 probe concentration (5 or 50 µM). The control (C) for each set corresponds to a sample of the differently folded TBAs incubated for the longer time (15 h) in the absence of compound.

High-resolution PAGE\nPreparation of the denaturing polyacrylamide solution\n\tNOTE: Prepare in advance 500 mL of 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel solution. Around 80 mL of this solution will be used for each experiment. Use an amber glass bottle or cover a glass bottle with aluminum foil to store the solution at RT.\n\tCAUTION: Polyacrylamide is neurotoxic. During all steps of gel preparation and pouring, wear gloves and a lab coat. Discard polymerized acrylamide in an appropriate box for contaminated materials.\n\t\nWeigh 210 g of urea in a 1 L beaker. Add 250 mL of 40% acrylamide/bisacrylamide (19/1) solution and 50 mL of 10x TBE (890 mM Tris-HCl, 890 mM borate, 20 mM EDTA, pH 8).\nPlace the beaker on a stir plate and mix the solution with a stirring rod. Cover the beaker with aluminum foil during mixing to prevent splashing and contamination.\nMix the solution until the urea is completely dissolved and the solution is clear.\n\t\tNOTE: This step can take many hours. To promote the dissolution of urea, add a small aliquot of water without going beyond the desired final volume.\nRemove the stirring rod. Pour the solution in a cylinder and add water to an exact final volume of 500 mL.",
    "Setting up of gel apparatus\n\t\nClean two plates (one notched and one unnotched) with 70% ethanol, let them dry, and then treat the plates with a dimethyldichlorosilane solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Silanization can be skipped, although it helps the release of the gel from one of the plates when the gel sandwich is taken apart.\n\t\tCAUTION: Handle the silanization solution with gloves and carry out the plate treatment with this solution in a fume hood.\nPlace the 0.4 mm spacers along the long edges of the longer plate, place the short plate on top of the other, and align the two plates at the bottom.\nPlace multiple layers of paper tape along all the edges except for the top.\nTo avoid leaks during casting, add an additional layer of tape to the bottom of the gel.\nClip the sides of the glass sandwich with clean clamps following the supplier's instructions (different suppliers use slightly different apparatus, sandwich clamps, and gaskets).\nPouring the gel\n\tNOTE: Pour the gel at RT (25 °C), since polyacrylamide polymerization is temperature-sensitive.\n\t\nIn a beaker, pour 80 mL of the previously prepared denaturing polyacrylamide solution (step 4.1), 450 µL of a 10% m/V ammonium persulphate (APS) solution, and 45 µL of tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) immediately before use.\nMix the solution and rapidly pour it down between the glass plates using a 50 mL syringe. Introduce the comb with the desired number of wells between the glass plates, avoiding bubbles. Add gel solution to fill the sandwich completely, if necessary. Place four clamps on the comb to press down and allow for even distribution of the wells.\nLet the gel polymerize for at least 45 min.\nRunning the gel",
    "After the polymerization, remove all the clamps and paper tape layers. Remove the comb slowly and thoroughly rinse the wells with distilled water.\nFollow the instructions from the specific supplier to correctly place the gel sandwich in the vertical gel electrophoresis apparatus.\nPrepare TBE running buffer (1x: 89 mM Tris-HCl, 89 mM borate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8) in deionized water and fill both the top and bottom reservoirs with the buffer.\nWarm up the plates by performing a pre-run of the gel electrophoresis for at least 30 min at 50 W.\nPrepare denaturing gel loading buffer (DGLB: 1 M Tris-HCl, 80% formamide, 50% glycerol, 0.05% bromophenol blue) in ultrapure water.\n\t\tNOTE: GLB helps to track the oligonucleotide samples' movement into the gel system and allows to load the samples into the gel's wells. The presence of the denaturing agent formamide allows DNA species to separate according to size, even in a non-denaturing PAGE.\nResuspend the dried samples (samples from step 3.8) in 5 µL of DGLB.\nBefore loading the samples, clean the wells using a small syringe and the TBE buffer in the upper buffer chamber to remove the urea from the wells.\n\t\tNOTE: Repeat this step several times to accurately clean the wells, thus avoiding bands difficult to be interpreted.\nLoad the samples into the clean wells and make a note of the order of loading.\nRun the gel electrophoresis for 2 h at 50 W, or at least until the bromophenol blue dye has run 2/3 down the gel.\nImaging the gel\n\t\nAfter electrophoresis, turn off the power supply, remove the glass sandwich, and clean the glasses.\nDetect the fluorescence of the FAM-labeled oligonucleotide bands by scanning using a gel imager.\nSubscription Required.
