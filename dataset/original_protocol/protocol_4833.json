    "Bone marrow sample was diluted with equal volume of DPBS, then the diluted sample was carefully layered onto the top of Ficoll-Paque PLUS. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 30 min with the brake off (Figure 1). The mononuclear cells were carefully harvested from the interface between the Ficoll-Paque PLUS and plasma using a sterile Pasteur pipette, and transfered to sterile centrifuge tubes. Cells were washed with an equal volume of DPBS twice to remove the Ficoll-Paque PLUS residue. After washing, the isolated mononuclear cells were cultivated in flasks coated with human fibronectin (25 μg/ml) and induced by ECGM2 medium at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in humidified air at a density of 3-5 x 106/cm2 (Figure 2).After 72 h in culture, non-adherent cells were removed by washing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), preheated fresh ECGM2 medium was applied and the cultivation was maintained through 7 d. All cells used in this experiment are cultivated with ECGM2 at passages 3 to 5.Quantitative fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed on a vantage SE flow cytometer to detect the surface marker of CD34, CD133, KDR, VE-cadherin, E-selectin, vWF on the cells at 7 and 14 d. Immunofluorescence staining was performed using Dil-ac-LDL and FITC-UEA-I. Brifely, cells were first incubated with Dil-ac-LDL (5 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 2 h and then fixed through incubation with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. They were subsequently incubated with UEA (10 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were visualized and photographed using a fluorescence microscope and counted at 200x magnification. Double-positive cells were considered to be differentiating EPCs. Plate 5 x 103 BM-EPCs in a 96-wells plate overnight to a confluent monolayer in ECGM2.",
    "Label the cells with 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 dye in PBS for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by washing with PBS three times. After washing, the cells are kept in the PBS in the cell incubator until the inoculating of another set of cells.Another set of BM-EPCs from the same donor are starved in a 96-wells plate (5 x 103/well) with basic medium (without any supplemented growth factors or fetal bovine serum) for 24 h, and treated with small molecule compounds.After 48 h incubation with the compounds to be investigated, the cells are washed twice with PBS, incubated with 2 μM calcein AM (100 μl/well) for 1 h in the cell incubator at 37 °C, followed by washing with PBS three times.The cells are detached using 0.25% trypsin-0.02% EDTA (50 μl/well) for 3 min, then resuspended with 100 μl ECGM2 and plated onto the established cell monolayer (acceptor cells) with the density of 3 x 103/well.The cultures were incubated in the PBS for 20 min at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 cell culture incubator.After that the cultures are washed gently using PBS (100 μl/well) three times.Attachment and spreading of the plated cells are monitored and recorded with a fluorescence microscope every 5 min (Figure 3).Quantification of intercellular adhesion is performed by counting the number of cells that are calcein-AM positive per microscopic field of view."
