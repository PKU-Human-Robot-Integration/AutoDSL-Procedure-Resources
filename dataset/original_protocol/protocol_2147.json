    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTotal RNA extraction\nTiming: 1.5 h\nPlanarian total RNA will be extracted from worms pooled from different regenerative time points as well as whole worms. Be sure to cool down the centrifuge to 4°C in advance.\nPlace worms in a 2 mL tube. Remove as much residual water as possible.\nCritical: If using another organism, be sure to include stages/time points where the gene of interest is expressed to ensure that its transcript will be included in the total RNA pool after extraction. We pool together multiple stages/time points to increase this likelihood.\nAdd 500 μL TRIzol reagent per 2–3 worms and place at −80°C for at least 1 h to quick-freeze them.\nCritical: TRIzol reagent is a toxic chemical and should be handled and disposed of safely.\nThaw the lysate at 20°C–22°C for 30 min to 1 h, vortexing every 10 min.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Transfer the clear supernatant to a new tube.\nIncubate for 5 min at 20°C–22°C to permit complete dissociation of the nucleoproteins complex.\nAdd 200 μL chloroform for 1 mL of TRIzol reagent used for lysis, then securely cap the tube. Vortex for 1 min.\nCritical: Chloroform is a toxic chemical and should be handled and disposed of safely.\nIncubate for 3 min at 20°C–22°C. Centrifuge the sample at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the upper aqueous phase containing the RNA to a new 2 mL tube by angling the tube at 45° and pipetting the solution out. Avoid transferring any of the interphase or organic layer into the pipette when removing the aqueous phase.",
    "Add 500 μL isopropanol per 1 mL of TRIzol reagent used for lysis to the aqueous phase. Mix for 2 s and incubate for 10 min at 20°C–22°C.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 12,000 × g at 4°C. Total RNA precipitate forms a white gel-like pellet at the bottom of the tube. Discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nAdd 1 mL of 75% ethanol for 1 mL of TRIzol reagent used for lysis.\nVortex the sample for 2 s, then centrifuge for 5 min at 7,500 × g at 4°C. Discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nAir dry the RNA pellet for 5–10 min. Do not dry for too long, as the pellet will be difficult to resuspend.\nResuspend the pellet in 20–50 μL nuclease-free water by pipetting up and down. The resuspension will be dark in color.\nIncubate in a heat block set at 55°C–60°C for 10–15 min.\nQuantify the RNA concentration using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer or Agilent’s Bioanalyzer.\nStore the RNA at −80°C or proceed with cDNA synthesis.\nNote: This protocol is adapted from (Liu and Rink, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) and (King and Newmark, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) as well as the manufacturer’s instructions for the TRIzol reagent[href=https://assets.fishersci.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/trizol_reagent.pdf].\ncDNA synthesis\nTiming: 1 h\nRNA is converted to cDNA to use as a template to synthesize the insert for the gene of interest in the Gibson assembly.\nThaw all components except the Reverse Transcriptase thoroughly and centrifuge for 2 s to collect components at the bottom of the tube before using. Place components on ice.\nAdd the following components to a 0.2 mL PCR tube in the indicated order:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1730_3.csv\nAdd the following components in the indicated order:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1730_4.csv\nMix gently and centrifuge for 2 s. Incubate the tube as follows in a thermal cycler:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1730_5.csv",
    "The reaction product can be used directly in PCR applications or stored at −20°C for less than one week. For longer storage, −80°C is recommended.\nNote: This protocol is adapted the manufacturer’s instructions for the RevertAid Reverse Transcriptase kit[href=https://assets.fishersci.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0012715_RevertAid_FirstStrand_cDNA_Syn_K1621_UG.pdf]. Alternatively, any other cDNA synthesis kit will work here.\ncDNA amplification\nTiming: 4 h\nUsing gene-specific primers with Gibson overhangs, the insert for the gene of interest is cloned from cDNA.\nPrepare the PCR master mix on ice:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1730_6.csv\nVortex the tubes for 2 s to mix. Run the tubes in a thermal cycler with the following conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1730_7.csv\nNote: Annealing temperature will depend on the primers you have designed. We recommend using the calculator from the polymerase vendor or your thermal cycler’s gradient feature to find the suitable annealing temperature for your primer pair.\nRun 1–3 μL of the PCR(s) on an agarose to confirm a successful PCR.\nClean the PCR(s) according to the manufacturer’s instructions for the PureLink PCR Purification Kit[href=https://assets.fishersci.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/purelink_pcr_man.pdf].\nAdd 4 volumes of PureLink Binding Buffer HC (B3) to 1 volume of the PCR product. Mix well.\nAdd the sample to a PureLink Spin Column.\nCentrifuge the column at 20°C–22°C at 10,000 × g for 1 min.\nDiscard the flow through and place the spin column into the collection tube.\nAdd 650 μL of Wash Buffer to the column.\nCentrifuge the column at 20°C–22°C at 10,000 × g for 1 min. Discard the flow through from the collection tube and place the column into the tube.\nCentrifuge the column at maximum speed at 20°C–22°C for 2–3 min to remove any residual Wash Buffer. Discard the collection tube.\nPlace the spin column in a clean 1.7 mL PureLink Elution Tube provided with the kit.",
    "Add 50 μL of Elution Buffer (or sterile water) to the center of the column.\nIncubate the column at 20°C–22°C for 1 min.\nCentrifuge the column at maximum speed for 2 min.\nRemove and discard the column (the recovered elution volume is ∼48 μL).\nNote: The PureLink purification kit has a buffer (B3) that allows for the removal of PCR products smaller than 300 bp. When running the PCR products on a gel, you will likely observe small bands distinct from the correctly-sized bands produced by the appropriate PCR amplification. We have found that small products (likely small primer products) interfere with subsequent Gibson reactions, so it is important to use Buffer B3 when purifying your PCR products.\nQuantify the concentration of the PCR product using your preferred method (i.e., Nanodrop, spectrophotometer, etc.).\nStore the gene insert PCR at −20°C until ready to proceed with Gibson assembly.\nAlternatives: High-fidelity polymerases (e.g., Phusion, Q5) are recommended to ensure high accuracy in the synthesis of your gene insert for the subsequent downstream nucleic acid synthesis products (e.g., riboprobes) to be as close to the target mRNA sequence as possible. However, we have also synthesized successful in situ riboprobes using Taq-based polymerases.\nGibson assembly and bacterial transformation\nTiming: 2 days\nThe PCR product from the gene of interest will be inserted into the pDL1 vector. The restriction digest of the vector and the Gibson reaction to insert the PCR product is done in the same tube.",
    "Note: The pDL1 plasmid (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) can be purchased through Addgene (cat #182263). Similar to plasmid pJC53.2 for T/A Cloning (Collins et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), pDL1 includes T3 and SP6 promoters for single-stranded RNA synthesis, and two T7 promoters and terminators for dsRNA synthesis. In addition, pDL1 includes a MCS region flanked by BspQI asymmetrical restriction sites, M13 forward and reverse universal sequences before the T7 terminators for complete forward and reverse sequencing of the inserted gene, and the AmpR resistance gene. pDL1 was constructed by Gibson assembly of PCR-amplified pGEM-5Zf(+) (Promega) backbone with two synthesized gBlocks (IDT), one for each T7 terminator-M13-promoters-restriction sequence due to the presence of the two inverted T7 promoters. In the design of the gBlock sequences, one base was added between the M13 promoters and T7 terminators to prevent hairpins in the M13 promoters and reduce annealing between the two opposite T7 terminator/promoter pairs. Finally, the T3 and SP6 promoter sequences are compatible with their universal primers, as an alternative to the M13 primers for sequencing.\nCalculate the volume needed of insert for a 3:1 molar ratio with 10–100 ng of pDL1 backbone (2196 bp after digestion of pDL1 with BspQI) as:\n  insert μl  = 3 ⋅  backbone μl  ⋅    backbone ng / μl   insert ng / μl    ⋅   insert bp backbone bp    \nWe regularly use 2 μL of vector diluted at 12.5 ng/μL, resulting in:\n  insert μl  = 3 ⋅   25  ng   insert ng / μl    ⋅   insert bp  2196  bp    \nThaw on ice two 0.2 mL PCR tubes with 10 μL 2× Gibson Master Mix (one experimental and one control).\nAdd to each PCR tube on ice:\nCalculated μL pDL1 backbone.\nCalculated μL insert DNA (experimental) OR equivalent μL nuclease-free water (control).\nNuclease-free water up to 10 μL total.\n0.5 μL BspQI.",
    "Note: BspQI cuts at the same site as SapI but at 50°C (the same temperature as the Gibson reaction), allowing the digest and the Gibson assembly to occur simultaneously in the same tube. Crucially, the restriction digest produces an asymmetrical cut, preventing the vector from re-linking. Thus, this results in very low background.\nPipet up and down to mix well.\nIncubate at 50°C for 1 h.\nWarm LB-Ampicillin (LB-Agar with 100 μg/mL ampicillin) plates to 37°C in plate incubator. LB-Agar plates can be stored at 4°C for up to 6 months.\nThaw two tubes of Mix & Go! Competent Cells on ice.\nNote: We found the Mix & Go! Competent Cells to be the most convenient for transformation, but other competent DH5α cells can be used.\nAdd 1 μL Gibson reaction to a tube of competent cells (both experimental and control). Incubate on ice for 5 min.\nPlate the entire tube of competent cells onto an LB-Ampicillin plate. Incubate the plates at 37°C for 12–18 h.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1730-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Graphical map of the pDL1 plasmid for the synthesis of single-stranded riboprobes and double-stranded RNAs\nThe multiple cloning site (MCS) is removed through the simultaneous digest with BspQI and Gibson assembly with the gene fragment insert.\nPlasmid purification and verification\nTiming: 2 days\nThe completed plasmid will be grown and purified and then sequenced to verify that the insert from the gene of interest has been inserted into the backbone.\nPrepare 15 mL LB-Ampicillin liquid media and divide equally into three 50 mL Falcon tubes. LB media can be stored at 20°C–22°C for 3–4 months.\nAdd a different single colony from the experimental LB-Ampicillin plate to each tube.\nIncubate the tubes in a shaker at 37°C at 400 rpm for 12–18 h.",
    "Note: The shaking rotational speed indicated is for a mini-shaker. It should be adjusted according to your particular shaker’s orbital diameter for standard bacterial culture growth.\nUsing ∼3.5 mL liquid culture, miniprep the liquid cultures using the manufacturer’s instructions for the GeneJET Plasmid Miniprep Kit[href=https://assets.fishersci.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0012655_GeneJET_Plasmid_Miniprep_UG.pdf].\nAdd 1.5 mL liquid culture to a 2 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 30 s at 20°C–22°C.\nRemove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nAdd 2 mL liquid culture to the 2 mL tube. Centrifuge again and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 250 μL of Resuspension Solution and vortex until the bacteria are resuspended (no cell clumps remain).\nAdd 250 μL of Lysis Solution and invert the tube 4–6 times until the solution becomes viscous and slightly clear.\nAdd 350 μL of Neutralization Solution and invert the tube 4–6 times. The neutralized bacterial lysate should become cloudy.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 5 min to pellet cell debris and chromosomal DNA.\nTransfer the supernatant to the supplied GeneJET spin column by pipetting. Avoid disturbing or transferring the white precipitate.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 1 min. Discard the flow through and place the column back into the same collection tube.\nAdd 500 μL of Wash Solution to the GeneJET spin column. Centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 30–60 s and discard the flow through. Place the column back into the same collection tube.\nRepeat the wash procedure (previous step) using 500 μL of Wash Solution.\nDiscard the flow through and centrifuge for an additional 1 min at 12,000 × g to remove residual Wash Solution. This step is essential to avoid residual ethanol in plasmid preps.",
    "Transfer the GeneJET spin column into a fresh 1.5 mL tube. Add 50 μL of Elution Buffer to the center of the spin column membrane to elute the plasmid DNA. Take care not to contact the membrane with the pipette tip. Incubate for 2 min at 20°C–22°C and centrifuge at 12,000 × g for 2 min.\nDiscard the column.\nAlternatives: Any plasmid miniprep kit can be used here to purify the plasmids.\nQuantify the plasmid concentrations. Purified plasmids can be stored at −20°C.\nRun 1–3 μL of the 3 plasmids on an agarose gel along with the original pDL1 vector to observe which plasmid had a successful Gibson reaction. A successful Gibson will result in the brightest band not running as far as the brightest band of pDL1.\nSequence the plasmid(s) with M13 forward and reverse primers to validate the successful Gibson reaction.\nNote: More colonies can be grown if none of the 3 initial colonies produced a plasmid with a successful Gibson reaction. However, the Gibson reaction and digest are very efficient, so this is very unlikely.\nSynthesis of RNA probes for in situ hybridization\nTiming: 16 h\nThe created vector is used to synthesize an RNA probe for the purpose of in situ hybridization.\nGenerate the DNA template for riboprobe transcription.\nPrepare the following PCR on ice: PCR master mix (Phusion DNA Polymerase)\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1730_8.csv\nNote: In order to have enough PCR template as input for the riboprobe transcription reaction, run multiple reactions simultaneously and pull them together before purifying the PCRs.\nVortex the tubes for 2 s to mix.

Ensure the transcription buffer is thawed and fully dissolved.\nNote: Using SP6 polymerase will result in the synthesis of a probe anti-sense to the gene insert sequence, while T3 polymerase will yield a probe sense to the gene insert. Both sense and anti-sense riboprobes can then be used in subsequent in situ hybridization experiments, with anti-sense probes used to detect the expression of the gene of interest and sense probes used as negative control.",
