    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nIsolation of Menstrual Blood-Derived Stromal Cells (MnSCs)\nTiming: 5–10 days\nMnSCs are obtained from the menstrual blood of volunteers at the peak of flow (first or second day of menses). The samples are collected in 5 mL of calcium/magnesium-free PBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 5 mM EDTA (collection medium). The cells are harvested with the informed consent of the donor as approved by an institutional review board. All cell lines must be regularly tested to ensure that they are free of mycoplasma prior to reprogramming and every 5–10 passages (we use a PCR-based test, see Key Resources Table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for specific reagent used in this protocol).\nPrepare 15 mL tubes containing 3 mL of Ficoll (Histopaque 1077-Sigma) and bring to 25°C.\nCarefully layer the menstrual blood sample onto the Ficoll Histopaque-1077 (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/289-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Transfer of the Menstrual Blood Sample onto the Ficoll Histopaque-1077\n(A) 15 mL tube containing 3 mL of Ficoll Histopaque-1077.\n(B and C) Menstrual blood sample layering onto Ficoll avoiding the disturbance of phases.\n(D) Supernatant containing MnSCs after centrifugation of menstrual blood sample.\nCritical: When transferring the menstrual blood sample into Ficoll-containing tubes it is important to add the blood drop by drop on the tube wall to avoid mixing with the Ficoll phase.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 30 min at 25°C to pellet red blood cells.\nRecover supernatant containing MnSCs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) and transfer into a clean 50 mL tube.\nWash the cells by adding 10 mL of DPBS with 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) and mix by gently drawing in and out of a 10 mL pipette.\nCentrifuge at 250 × g for 10 min to pellet stromal cells.\nDiscard supernatant.\nRepeat steps 5–7 twice.",
    "Resuspend cell pellet with 1 mL of MnSC medium using a p1000 micropipette.\nAdd 6 mL of MnSC and transfer cell suspension into a T25 cell culture flask.\nPlace in a 5% CO2, 37°C incubator.\nChange MnSC medium every other day.\nWhen the cells reach 80%–90% confluency (usually after 5–7 days) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) (see Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.1]), dissociate them by adding 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA to the T25 flask after PBS washing and incubate for 5–10 min at 37°C.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/289-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. MnSC Morphology\nBright-field microscopic image showing isolated MnSC morphology and appearance at 80% confluency. Scale bar, 20 μm.\nAdd 5 mL of MnSC medium to inactivate the trypsin and mix well by gently pipetting up and down using a 5 mL pipette and plate at 104 cells/cm2.\nSplit the cells every four – five days to maintain 80% confluence. See Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.5].\nCritical: Do not dilute cells below 5 × 103 cells/cm2. Low confluency yields into poor cell proliferation and early senescence.\nPause Point: Cells may be stored at −80°C for short-term storage or in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage. Freeze cells in 10% DMSO/FBS.\nPreparation of the Reprogramming Viruses\nTiming: 5–8 days\nRetroviral particles are prepared from pMX-backbone based vectors (from Cell Biolabs, find information in Key Resources Table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) encoding reprogramming factors ASF1A, SOX15 and OCT4 (AOX15)(please find pMX-ASF1A, pMX-SOX15 and pMX-OCT4 vector description in Lopez-Caraballo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])(Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Retroviral particles will be used to over express AOX15 combination in MnSCs.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/289-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Seed ~5 × 106 cells of HEK293T cells onto a 100 mm tissue culture plate and culture for 24–48 h in 293T medium.\nDay 0: When the cells reach 100% confluency split cells at a 1:4 ratio. Allow cells to reach 80%–90% confluency (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). See Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.9].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/289-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. 293T Morphology\nBright-field image of (A) 100% confluent and (B) 80%–90% confluent 293T cells. Cells should appear similar to image (B) immediately prior to transduction. Scale bar, 50 μm.\nDay 1: Remove medium and replace with 10 mL fresh pre-warmed growth medium 1–2 h before transfection.\nCritical: Be careful not to dislodge the cells when adding the medium.\nPrepare the two solutions listed below in 15 mL Eppendorf tubes for each of the retroviruses:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_289_1.csv\nAdd 60 μL PEI (1 μg/μL in water, pH7) to the mixture (4:1 v/w ratio of PEI:DNA), drop by drop while vortexing at medium speed (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCritical: When adding PEI to the DNA mix, it is important to add it drop by drop while vortexing.\nVortex briefly (30 s) and leave for 10 min at 25°C.\nAdd the mixture dropwise in a circular motion, to the 293T cells.\nGently rock the plate in a back and forth and side-to-side motion to ensure even distribution of the transfection mixture. Incubate the plate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator for 8 h.\nAfter 8 h aspirate the medium and add 6 mL of 293T medium.\nCritical: Do not exceed 12 h post-transfection.",
    "Virus Collection Point 1: Approximately 36 h after transfection (on day 3), collect the supernatant using a disposable syringe and filter the supernatant using a 0.45 μm syringe filter, into a 50 mL conical tube. Use this supernatant for cell transduction or store this tube for 17–18 h at 4°C. For short term storage freeze supernatants down at −20°C (up to 1 month) or at −80°C for long-term storage (up to 6 months).\nGently and slowly add 6 mL of fresh 293T medium down the side of the culture plate and incubate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator for 24 h.\nCritical: Be careful not to dislodge the cells when removing or adding the medium.\nVirus Collection Point 2: On day 4, repeat step one from day 3, by filtering the additional 8 mL of medium into a 50 mL conical tube and use for cell transduction or store as in virus collection point 1.\nVirus titration using 293T transduction and flow cytometric analysis:\nThe day before transduction (day 0), plate 6 × 105 293T cells in a 6-well plate (105 cells/well).\nOn day 1, add 1 mL or 3 mL of pMX-SOX15, pMX-ASF1A or pMX-OCT4 viral supernatant to each well (6 total). pMX-SOX15 and pMX-ASF1A will allow expression of GFP as they are bicistronic vectors, while pMX-OCT4 will not express GFP (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) and thus it will be the GFP negative control.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_289_2.csv\nIncubate in a 37°C, 5% CO2 tissue culture incubator for 24 h.\nOn day 2, replace medium with 2 mL/well of 293T medium.\nIncubate for 72 h (replacing the medium 48 h after transduction, on day 4).\nOn day 5, dissociate transduced and control (non-transduced) 293T cells with 0.05% Trypsin/EDTA, and resuspend pellet with 1 mL of 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA).",
    "Incubate 20 min at 25°C to fix the cells.\nWash cells adding 10 mL of DPBS, centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Repeat this step once again.\nResuspend cells with 0.5–1 mL PBS-0.1% BSA-150 mM EDTA-0.02% sodium azide and analyze cells by flow cytometry.\nPause Point: or store cells at 4°C for up to 1 week.\nAnalyze GFP positive cells by flow cytometry (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/289-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Dot plots (A) and histograms (B) showing percentages of GFP positive cells under each condition.\nNote: Only viral supernatant reaching an efficiency of 80% GFP positive cells in 1 mL supernatant (and over 95% in 3 mL) should be used for cell reprogramming.\n        Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n      \nMethods Video S1. Time Lapse Movie Showing the Drop-By-Drop Addition of PEI to DNA Mix, Related to Step 20\nAOX15 Reprogramming of MnSCs\nTiming: 3–4 weeks\nMnSCs are reprogrammed into iPSC using the oocyte-based factor combination ASF1A, SOX15 and OCT4 (AOX15). Transduction of the reprogramming factors must be carried out using low passage MnSC cells (ideally passage 3–5).\nThe day before reprogramming (day 0) plate 10 5 MnSCs into 35 mm cell culture plates.\n24 h later (day 1), add 5 mL of each pMX-SO15, pMX-ASF1A and pMX-OCT4 retroviral supernatant (it should be a MOI= 5 for each vector), and 15 μL of 8 μg/mL polybrene per plate and return plate to incubator.\nNote: When using frozen viral supernatant, thaw them on ice.\nOn day 2, replace medium with 5 mL of MnSC medium and return plate to incubator. See Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec5.11].",
    "On day 4, dissociate cells and plate 5 × 104 cells/well (6-well plate) containing iMEFs using hES medium as the final medium and return plate to incubator.\nChange hES medium daily.\nOn day 14–21, the reprogrammed cells should now transform from fibroblast morphology to a round shaped morphology (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) and can be collected for characterization of pluripotency markers (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]) and reprogramming efficiency and can be further analyzed for iPSC phenotype and pluripotent state characterization as needed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/289-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.
