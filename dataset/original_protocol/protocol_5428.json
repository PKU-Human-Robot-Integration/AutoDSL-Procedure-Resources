    "Coat glass coverslips and 4-well/24-well plates with collagen I working solution (150 μg/ml)Autoclave round glass coverslips, 13 mm diameter, in advance.Roughly estimate the desired number of round glass coverslips, and place one glass coverslip within one well of a 24-well plate in a biological safety hood. Coat each coverslip with enough collagen I (~400 μl for each well) at room temperature (RT) for 2 h.Remove collagen I, rinse coverslips with sterile H2O twice and allow the coverslips to dry overnight.Store coated plates and plates with coated coverslips at 4 °C for no more than 2 weeks.Embryo preparation Note: This can be done on a lab bench. Timed pregnant mice are sacrificed by CO2. To isolate neural crest cells from the neural tube, dissect embryos at the embryonic day (E) 9.0 (12-15 somite stage). To isolate neural crest-derived cells form pharyngeal arches posterior to the 2nd arch, dissect embryos at E9.5 (24-26 somite stage).Place the sacrificed mouse on its back, and wet the lower abdomen with 70% ethanol. Open the peritoneal cavity with fine scissors, push gut aside and expose the uterus.Cut the uterus from the cervix with fine scissors. Hold the broken end of the uterus with forceps, pull the uterus straight, open a small hole on the uterus, insert a fine tip of scissors into the uterus, and slowly cut open the uterus on the vessel-free edge of the uterus.Pick up the embryos and transfer to a dish with DPBS at RT.Isolation of neural crest cells from neural tubes (see Movie in Pfaltzgraff et al., 2012)Neural tube dissection and explant culture: Note: Dissection should be done inside a horizontal flow hood. Prepare collagenase/dispase solution fresh for each experiment: add 50 μl of 100 mg/ml collagenase/dispase stock solution to 5 ml DPBS at RT. Pipet 500 μl into each 1.",
    "5 ml centrifuge tube. One tube will be used to digest one embryo. Under dissection microscope, isolate E9.0 embryos by stripping of decidua and membranes with fine forceps. Trim off the tail of the embryo.Wash each embryo once in DPBS at RT by transferring it into a new plate with fresh DPBS, and then transfer the embryo into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube containing 500 μl of the collagenase/dispase solution by using sterile plastic transfer pipet. Incubate embryos at 37 °C water bath for 7 min. The incubation time is critical. It is difficult to separate the neural tube from the surrounding tissue if the tissue is not digested enough; however, if over-digested, the neural tube will be curled.While waiting for the digestion, pipet 180 μl self-renewal medium into each well of a 4-well Nunc plate coated with collagen I, and label 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes, which will be used to save the rest of the embryo for genotyping. Wash embryos with DPBS three times. And transfer embryos to a 35-mm dish in DPBS. Under dissection microscope, hold the head of the embryo with one pair of forceps, and peel the surface ectoderm overlaying the cardiac neural tube segment (from otic vesicle to the 3rd somite) with another pair of fine forceps. Insert the tips of forceps between the lateral neural tube and the somites, and carefully separate them by moving the tip back and forth. Do the same for the other side of the neural tube. If the digestion is ideal, it should be very easy to do this step. Cut the neural tube at the level of the otic vesicle and the upper edge of the 4th somite, and free the neural tube from ventral tissues. Rinse the neural tube with self-renewal medium (Bixby et al.",
    ", 2002) and transfer neural tube segments to the center of wells containing 180 μl self-renewal medium. The neural tube will dry out if too little medium is used and will float in the medium if too much is used. Place the neural tube laterally, so the neural crest cells can migrate out and attach to the bottom of the dish. Save the rest of the embryo for genotyping. 12 h later, when the neural tube is well-attached to the bottom, carefully and slowly add 350 μl of fresh self-renewal medium pre-warmed to 37 °C into each well and culture 4 more days. Replace half of the medium with fresh self-renewal medium on the 3rd day.Isolation of cardiac neural crest-derived cells from pharyngeal arches (Figure 1 and Video 1)Pharyngeal arch dissection and culture:Note: Dissection should be done within the horizontal flow hood.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170831/20170831010217_7383.jpgFigure 1. Work-flow of isolation cardiac neural crest cells from E9.5 mouse embryo and their differentiation into smooth muscle cellsPrepare collagenase/dispase solution.Dissect E9.5 embryos.Digest embryos with collagenase/dispase at 37 °C in a water bath for 4 min; if multiple embryos are processed, digest one embryo at a time.While waiting for the digestion to complete, pipet 500 μl self-renewal medium into each well of 24-well plate coated with collagen I, and label 1.5 centrifuge tubes that will be used to save a small part of each embryo for genotyping.Wash each embryo with DPBS three times, and transfer to a 35-mm dish in DPBS for dissection. Video 1 starts at this step:Under dissection microscope, hold the head of the embryo with one pair of forceps, chop off the embryo’s tail and peel the surface ectoderm off of pharyngeal region (PA 3-6) with another pair of fine forceps. Trim the head off from the upper edge of PA 3.",
    "Trim the heart off by cutting through the aortic sac. Detach the pharyngeal arches from the dorsal tissue by cutting through both dorsal aortae. The pharyngeal arch tissue is composed of cardiac neural crest cells and other cell types, such as mesodermal and endodermal cells.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Demonstration of dissection of pharyngeal arches 3-6 from E9.5 embryos Transfer the dissected piece of pharyngeal tissue to a 24-well plate. The tissue will sink and attach to the bottom of the well in 12 h. Save the rest of the embryo for genotyping.Culture pharyngeal arch tissue for 4 days. And replace half of the medium with fresh self-renewal medium on the 3rd day.Smooth muscle cell differentiation Note: This should be done within a biological safety hood. To replate neural crest cells that have migrated from neural tube explant (Figure 2A), the neural tube should be removed by pipetting the medium up and down in the wells for about 5 times (neural crest cells will not be affected because they are tightly attached to the bottom). This step is omitted for the pharyngeal arch culture. Wash the wells containing neural crest cells once with DPBS pre-warmed to 37 °C, and incubate with 150 μl 0.25% trypsin for 1 min at 37 °C or until all cells round up and appear to be nearly detached from the plate.Add 350 μl differentiation medium into each well, pipet up and down about 5 times, to dissociate neural crest cells into single cells. Together with trypsin, wells now have 500 μl of medium. Cells can now be plated for differentiation, as described in the next step. There are usually enough cells to split into 4 wells of a 24-well plate.",
    "For differentiation, plate neural crest cells onto collagen I-coated coverslips in a 24-well plate, and culture for 2 h. When cells settle down, replace the medium with fresh differentiation medium and culture for 2 days.ImmunostainingTo identify neural crest-derived smooth muscle cells, neural crest cultures were stained for GFP (neural crest cells are GFP+) and smooth muscle cell markers, such as αSMA and Calponin.Rinse cells with DPBS and fix them at RT with 4% PFA pre-warmed to RT for 20 min, then rinse with DPBS 3 times, 5 min each, before proceeding for immunostaining.Permeabilize cells with 500 μl 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS (PBST) for 10 min at RT. Get coverslips from wells, and place them in a flat dish covered with Parafilm. The dish should be shallow, and should be topped with a lid. Tuck a few wet Kimwipes near sides of the dish to create a humidified environment when the dish is closed. Make sure the side of the coverslip with cells faces up. Add 50 μl of blocking buffer (5% normal donkey serum in PBST) for 30 min at RT. This set up minimizes the volume of antibody solutions used for staining, only 30 μl solution is required to cover cells on the coverslip.Remove the blocking buffer by aspiration, and add 30 μl of primary antibody solution in blocking buffer for 2 h at RT. The antibody concentrations: anti-GFP 1:500; anti-αSMA 1:300; anti-calponin 1:150.Return coverslips to wells in a multi-well plate and wash with PBST 3 times, changing to fresh PBST every 10 min.Get coverslips from the wells and place them on Parafilm in the staining chamber, add secondary antibodies and incubate for 1 h at RT: anti-chicken, anti-goat, anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa 488, Alexa 555, Alexa 647, all diluted at 1:300.",
    "Put coverslips back into the wells of a multi-well plate, and wash with PBST 3 times, changing to fresh PBST every 10 min.Place 10 μl of anti-fade mounting reagent (with DAPI) on a glass slide, then put the coverslip upside down on the reagent.Observe slides using a fluorescence microscope."
