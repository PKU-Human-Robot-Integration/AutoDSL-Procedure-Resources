    "NOTE: Intracoronary acetylcholine testing has been approved by the local ethics committee and the protocol follows the guidelines of our institution for human research.\n1. Preparation of the Acetylcholine Solutions (See Materials Table)\nMix the 20 mg acetylcholine with the 2 ml solvent provided with the package.\nAdd the 2 ml ACH solution to 98 ml of NaCl 0.9 %. This corresponds to a dose of 0.2 mg/ml and is called stock solution 1. Add 9 ml of stock solution 1 to 91 ml of NaCl 0.9%, This corresponds to a dose of 18 µg/ml and is called stock solution 2.\nPrepare 3 perfusion syringes (each of 50 ml) labeled as \"high\", \"medium\" and \"low\". Fill the perfusion syringe 1 labeled \"high\" with 40 ml of stock solution 2.\nFill the perfusion syringe 2 (labeled \"medium\") with 8 ml of the perfusion syringe 1 (high) and add 32 ml of NaCl 0.9%. This corresponds to a dose of 3.6 µg/ml.\nFill the perfusion syringe 3 (labeled \"low\") with 4 ml of the perfusion syringe 2 (medium) and add 36 ml of NaCl 0.9%. This corresponds to a dose of 0.36 µg/ml.\n2. Preparation of the Syringes for Intracoronary Injection of Acetylcholine\nPrepare 5 syringes for the intracoronary injection (4 syringes of 5 ml [#1, #2, #3, #4] and 1 syringe of 10 ml).\nFill the 5 ml syringe #1 with 6 ml from the perfusion syringe labeled \"low\" (see step 1.5). This corresponds to a dose of approximately 2 µg.\nFill the 5 ml syringe #2 with 6 ml from the perfusion syringe labeled \"medium\". This corresponds to a dose of approximately 20 µg.\nFill the 5 ml syringe #3 with 5.5 ml from the perfusion syringe labeled \"high\". This corresponds to a dose of approximately 100 µg.",
    "Fill the 10 ml syringe with 11 ml from the perfusion syringe labeled \"high\". This corresponds to a dose of approximately 200 µg.\nFill the 5 ml syringe #4 with 4.5 ml from the perfusion syringe labeled \"high\". This corresponds to a dose of approximately 80 µg. Put this syringe aside and only use it for assessment of the right coronary artery.\n3. Diagnostic Coronary Angiography\nInject local anaesthesia either in proximity to the right radial artery (usually 2 ml of mepivacain) or in proximity to the right femoral artery (usually 15 ml of mepivacain).\nConfirm the success of local anesthesia is by pricking the anesthetized-skin with the needle and asking the patient if pain is still present.\nPuncture the artery according to the Seldinger technique13 with a cannula, then insert the wire through the cannula and remove it. Insert the sheath (usually 5F) over the wire. Perform coronary angiography under sterile conditions.\nAdvance the wire through the sheath to the ascending aorta and place the diagnostic catheter above the aortic valve. Then remove the wire and connect the catheter with the contrast syringe.\n\tNOTE: The contrast agent contains Iomeprol, Trometamol, hydrochloric acid and water.\nPlace the diagnostic catheter for the left coronary artery in the left main stem by slightly pulling and turning the catheter. Confirm correct positioning of the catheter by injecting 2 ml of contrast agent.\nPerform coronary angiography according to the Judkins technique14 with manual injections of approximately 10 ml of contrast to visualize the coronary arteries in different views.\n\tNOTE: Usually LAO 40° and RAO 35° are used for the right coronary artery and LAO 45°/CRAN 25°, RAO 30°/CRAN 30° and RAO 20°/CAUD 30° are used for the left coronary artery.\nStart acetylcholine testing after exclusion of any relevant epicardial stenosis (≥50%) by visual assessment.",
    "4. Intracoronary Injection of Acetylcholine\nInject 6 ml of the 2 µg syringe #1 into the left coronary artery. Inject this within 20 sec with continuous monitoring of the ECG and the patient's symptoms (e.g. chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness). Perform coronary angiography of the left coronary artery (usually a RAO 20°/CAUD 30° projection is best projection) after injection of the 6 ml.\nPerform coronary angiography by injecting 10 ml of contrast manually via the contrast syringe into the catheter. The 12-lead-ECG should be recorded and printed after every dose of acetylcholine. A pause of 1 min should lie between every dose.\nInject 6 ml of the 20 µg syringe #2 into the left coronary artery. Inject this within 20 sec with continuous monitoring of the ECG and the patient's symptoms. Perform coronary angiography of the left coronary artery after injection of the 6 ml as mentioned above.\nInject 5.5 ml of the 100 µg syringe #3 into the left coronary artery. Inject this within 20 sec with continuous monitoring of the ECG and the patient's symptoms. Perform coronary angiography of the left coronary artery after injection of the 5.5 ml as mentioned above.\n\tNOTE: Most patients report some symptoms, show ECG changes or epicardial vasoconstriction at this dose. Sometimes the speed of the manual injection needs to be slowed down. As mentioned below different protocols for ACH-testing are in use with a different speed of injection. A slower injection over a period of 3 min compared to the injection within 20 sec may also be feasible.",
    "If no spasm (i.e. >90% vasoconstriction compared to the relaxed state of the vessel after 200 µg nitroglyercine injection) occurs at the 100 µg dose continue with the 200 µg (10 ml syringe) ACH dose. Inject the 11 ml within 20 sec with continuous monitoring of the ECG and the patient's symptoms.\nPerform coronary angiography of the left coronary artery after injection of the 11 ml as mentioned above (section 3).\n\tNOTE: Although the 200 µg dose has been applied in many patients it should be mentioned that appropriate doses of intracoronary acetylcholine remain to be fully defined. Some authors suggest that 100 µg should be the maximum dose for the left coronary artery.\n\tNOTE: Often bradycardia occurs and the speed of the injection needs to be slowed down.\nInject 80 µg ACH (4.5 ml, syringe #4) into the right coronary artery if no abnormal findings are seen during testing of the left coronary artery. Inject this within 20 sec with continuous monitoring of the ECG and the patient's symptoms. Often bradycardia occurs and the speed of the injection needs to be slowed down to prevent prolonged bradycardia and/or asystole.\nPerform coronary angiography of the right coronary artery after injection of the 4.5 ml (usually a LAO 40°/0° projection is best) as mentioned above (section 3).\nInject intracoronary nitroglycerine with a dose of 200 µg into each tested artery after the test or when severe symptoms (i.e. severe chest pain or severe shortness of breath), ischemic ECG shifts or epicardial spasm occurs.\nImage the vessel as mentioned in step 4.2 after one minute to document reversion of spasm.\nSubscription Required.
