    "In the present study, samples were collected during a clinically indicated bronchoscopy after obtaining informed consent under a protocol approved by the UNC Institutional Review Board.\n1. Sputum/mucus collection and storage\nCollect airway mucus via sputum collection or bronchoscopy aspiration.\n\t\nCollect sputum either via spontaneous expectoration or induce sputum by 3% hypertonic saline inhalation. Alternatively, directly aspirate mucus from the airways during a bronchoscopy procedure.\nStore collected airway sputum/mucus in sterile specimen cups. In the case of sputum, remove excess saliva from the sample immediately upon collection.\nPlace the samples on ice for transport. Limit the transport time to less than 4 h.\nAnalyze the samples at the time of collection or store at -80 °C until processed.\n\t\nBefore storage, homogenize the mucus by gently pipetting up and down three to five times with a positive displacement pipette or pipette directly into the microcentrifuge tubes.\nAliquot the samples for storage in volumes ≥500 µL to ensure sufficient volume for experiments.\n\t\tNOTE: Freezing and thawing may affect the viscoelastic properties of the sample. Only compare samples that have undergone similar freeze/thaw cycles.\n2. Sample preparation\nPipette fresh and frozen sputa/mucus directly or homogenize specimens using a positive displacement pipette by gently pipetting up and down three to five times before aliquoting.\n\tNOTE: Homogenization is important for samples that contain thick plugs that can affect reproducibility.\nAliquot 400-500 µL of the sample into separate microcentrifuge tubes. Prepare as many aliquots as needed for repeat measurements and/or treatment with pharmacological reagents (e.g., rhDNase, N-acetyl cysteine). Incubate the aliquots to be tested at 37 °C for a minimum of 5 min prior to measurement.\nFor testing pharmacological agents (optional), use high concentrations of stock solutions to prevent sample dilution.",
    "Add between 0.4% and 10% volume (to minimize specimen dilution) of the desired reagent (e.g., TCEP) directly onto the sample. Make sure no drop of the compound stays on the side of the tube.\nIncubate the samples at 37 °C for the desired length of time to allow a chemical reaction (<1 h to prevent the proteolytic degradation of the mucus).\nMix the mucus sample and reagent by flicking the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube every 2 min to allow progressive penetration of the reagent into the mucus sample without compromising the mucin network (e.g., mimicking ciliary beating and mucociliary clearance). When comparing multiple drug reagents, ensure that the incubation time is similar.\n3. Instrument initialization and calibration\nTurn on the machine (Table of Materials) and initialize the software.\nSelect New Measurement. Enter the sample identification number under Measure ID and the name of the operator under Operator to continue. Enter additional information or comments under Comments.\nSelect a geometry set (i.e., rough, or smooth 25 mm parallel plates) and inspect large and small plates carefully to ensure that plates are clean and in perfect condition).\n\tNOTE: Rough plates are designed for large volumes (350-500 µL) and smooth plates are designed for smaller volumes (250-350 µL). Using a lower or higher sample volume than recommended can cause inaccurate measurements.\nInsert the large plate firmly on the bottom pulpit.\nInsert the small plate gently on the upper pulpit and lock the plate by slightly rotating until hearing a \"click\", which indicates that the plate is properly clamped. Note that free oscillation of the upper plate is normal.\nWait until the temperature reaches the 37 °C target value. Then, initiate automatic calibration as prompted by the software.\n\t​NOTE: Do not disturb the machine or benchtop surface during this process.\n4. Sample loading",
    "Using a positive displacement pipette, slowly pipette between 250 and 500 µL of the sample on the center of the large bottom plate. Once deposited on the plate, viscous samples will adopt a dome shape whereas highly elastic samples may require physical severing (use dissecting scissors).\n\tNOTE: Avoid introducing air bubbles. If needed, remove residual bubbles by pushing away with a pipette tip.\nLower the measuring head carrying the small plate via the software and observe the sample. If properly loaded on the bottom plate, the sample will make contact and be centered between the two plates.\nTo ensure that the sample fills the gap (i.e., by spreading to the edges of the plates), use the Reduce Gap function until the sample is no longer in a biconcave shape or is aligned with the edge of the plates. The Reduce Gap function lowers the measuring head in 0.1 mm increments and is limited to seven increments.\n\tNOTE: Monitor the sample carefully and adjust the gap progressively to avoid overspill.\n\t\nIf a gap remains after seven increments, click on Redo Installation to return to the initial position and adjust the position and/or volume of the sample.\nIf the gap is exceedingly reduced (e.g., biconvex shape), remove the excess sample with a spatula by a circular motion along the edge of the upper plate. Make sure to trim the excess sample gently to avoid shear stress.\n\t\t​NOTE: At the end of this step, the edge of the sample should be aligned with the edge of the upper plate as shown in the user guidelines.\nLower the protective cover to avoid any accidental projection of contaminated fluids during oscillation.\n5. Initiate biophysical measurement\nTo initiate measurement, click on Start Analysis. A full cycle will take 4-7 min.",
    "Avoid talking loudly and touching the device or the bench during the entire length of the cycle. A quiet environment is particularly important for the first 2 min.\n\t\tNOTE: During the cycle, the instrument performs a standardized strain sweep test, which consists of successive oscillating steps. Each step is a series of 10 oscillations at constant amplitude and frequency (1 Hz), during which the corresponding torque is measured in real-time. The strain and torque signals allow computation of the complex (G*), elastic (G'), and viscous (G\") moduli, as well as the damping ratio (tan δ) at each step. Oscillations gradually increase in amplitude, which intensifies the deformation imposed on the sample.\n6. Sample removal\nOnce the cycle is complete, click on Next to raise the measuring head and generate the sample analysis report.\n\tNOTE: For the report, the software computes the recorded data and automatically graphs two curves showing the evolution of the viscous and the elastic moduli in relation to the deformation exerted to the sample and displays the linear viscoelastic regime (i.e., a plateau at low deformation) if present. If no linear regime is detected, the values of G', G\", G*, and tan δ are extracted at 0.05 strain. In addition, the crossover strain and yield stress (γc, and σc) are calculated at tan δ = 1. Data are also provided in spreadsheets for each step for further analysis.\nOnce the measuring head is fully retracted, raise the protective cover, discard the sample and carefully remove the plates. Clean and disinfect the plates using warm water and soap.\n\tNOTE: Dry the geometry set thoroughly before repeated use.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
