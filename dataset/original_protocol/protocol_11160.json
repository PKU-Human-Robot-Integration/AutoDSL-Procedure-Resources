    "1. Plating cells\nNOTE: In this described protocol, HEK293 stable cell lines, previously generated for stable inducible expression of Nek4 were used21, however, the same protocol is suitable to many other cell lines, such as HEK29322, HeLa23,24,25,26, U-2 OS27, COS728, SH-SY5Y29. The pattern of expression of minigene E1A isoforms under basal conditions varies between these cells and should be characterized for each condition. This protocol is not limited to stable cell lines. The most common approach in evaluation of candidate protein is by transient co-transfection of increasing its amount with fixed amount of the minigene. The same protocol is suitable for knockout cells.\nPlate cells considering vehicle, untransfected and GFP controls.\nCulture HEK293 cells with stable expression of the gene of interest in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% of Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 4.5 g/L Glucose, 4 mM L-Glutamine and maintain with 100 µg/mL of hygromycin B, on tissue culture-treated plates at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and a humidified atmosphere.\nSplit cells using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Plate 3 x 105 cells in 6-well plates and incubate them for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\n\t​NOTE: For transfection, cells must be 70-80% confluent to decrease cell death after the transfection.\n2. Cell transfection\nNOTE: 1-2 µg of pMTE1A minigene plasmid was used here, however the DNA amount, as well as the time of expression, must be kept at minimal to avoid toxicity. For example, high toxicity was observed in HeLa cells after 30 h of transfection with 1 µg of pMTE1A DNA. For the transfection described here, a lipid-based transfection reagent was used\nCheck cell confluence 24 h after plating and transfect HEK293 stable cells only when 70-80% confluent.",
    "Remove the cell culture medium carefully with a pipette, instead of using a vacuum pump system. Then carefully add 2 mL of complete DMEM medium without antibiotics and put the plate back in the incubator.\nPrepare a tube with the transfection buffer (200 µL/well), add 2 µg of pMTE1A DNA, vortex and then add 2 µL of transfection reagent. Vortex again and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nRemove plates from the incubator and carefully add the transfection mixture dropwise.\nTo HEK293 stable cells, add tetracycline (0.5 µg/mL) for Nek4 expression induction 6 h after the transfection. Medium change is not necessary.\n\t​NOTE: Volumes/amounts described in this section are for one well. Prepare the mixture for all wells used in the experiment in the same tube.\nPrepare one well to transfect with EGFP, or another fluorophore expressing plasmid to estimate the transfection efficiency. Better results can be observed with transfection efficiency of at least 40%, but good performances with lower transfection efficiency were previously observed.\nWhen using co-transfection (interest protein and minigene) keep a well with non-transfected cells to avoid obtaining results from endogenous mRNA. In the case of E1A, HEK293 cells already express the E1A gene30.\n3. Preparing the drugs\nNOTE: The time and concentration of treatment were chosen based on literature results, which point out changes in alternative splicing for some genes.\nPerform a dose-response curve before starting the assay to determine the minimal concentration to alternative splicing induction with no effect in cell viability.\nPrepare a Paclitaxel stock solution at 5 mM concentration in ethanol. The final concentration is 1 µM. Keep at -20 °C. Use 0.02% ethanol as vehicle control.",
    "Prepare a cisplatin solution by diluting in 0.9% NaCl at around 0.5 mg/mL (1.66 mM). Protect from light, vortex and incubate in a thermal bath, 37 °C for 30 min. The final concentration is 30 µM. Prepare fresh or store at 2-10 °C for until one month.\n\t​NOTE: All drugs must be protected from the light.\n4. Cell treatment and collection\nNOTE: HEK293 stable cells were collected 48 h after the transfection and for this were treated 24 h after the transfection because the highest Nek4 expression level is achieved within 48 h. However, high levels of 13S isoform expression (until 90%) were observed at this time. To decrease the proportion of 13S isoform, try to treat and collect cells 30 h after transfection maximum.\nUse RNA/DNase free tips and tubes. Perform total RNA extraction with phenol-chloroform reagent following manufacturer's recommendation.\n24 h after the transfection, verify cell morphology and transfection efficiency using a fluorescent microscope.\nRemove the cell culture medium, preferentially using a pipette instead of a vacuum pump system. Then add cell culture medium with the chemotherapeutics in the previously described final concentration.\nIncubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 18 - 24 h.\nCollect RNA by discarding the cell culture medium in a container and adding 0.5 - 1 mL of RNA extraction reagent directly to the well. If wells are very confluent, use 1 mL of RNA extraction reagent to improve RNA quality.\nHomogenize with the pipette and transfer to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. At this point, the protocol can be paused by storing samples at -80 °C or proceed immediately to the RNA extraction.\n\t​WARNING: The phenol-based RNA extraction reagent is toxic and all procedures should be performed in a chemical fume hood and the residues disposed properly.\n5. RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis",
    "In a fume hood thaw the samples and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Add 0.1 -0.2 mL of chloroform and agitate vigorously.\nIncubate for 3 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 x g and 4 °C.\nCollect the upper aqueous phase and transfer to a new 1.5 mL centrifuge tube. Collect around 60% of the total volume; however, do not collect the DNA or the organic (lower) phase.\nAdd 0.25 - 0.5 mL of isopropanol and agitate by inversion 4 times. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min, at 4 °C and discard the supernatant.\nWash the RNA pellet twice with ethanol (75% in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water). Centrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 min and discard the ethanol.\nRemove excess ethanol by inverting the tube on a towel paper and then leave the tube open inside a fume hood to partially dry the pellet for 5 - 10 min.\nResuspend the RNA pellet in 15 µL of DEPC-treated water.\nQuantify total RNA using absorbance at 230 nm, 260 nm, and 280 nm to verify RNA quality.\nTo verify total RNA quality, run a 1% agarose gel pre-treated with 1.2% (v/v) of a 2.5% sodium hypochlorite solution for 30 min31.\nPerform cDNA synthesis using 1-2 µg of total RNA.\n\t\nPipette RNA, 1 µL of oligo-dT (50 µM), 1 µL of dNTP (10 mM) and make up the volume to 12 µL with nuclease free water. Incubate in the thermocycler for 5 min at 65 °C.\nRemove samples from the thermocycler to cool down and prepare the reaction mixture: 4 µL of reverse transcriptase buffer, 2 µL of dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 µL of ribonuclease inhibitor. Incubate at 37 °C for 2 min.",
    "Add 1 µL of thermo-stable reverse transcriptase. Incubate at 37 °C for 50 min and inactivate the enzyme at 70 °C for 15 min.\n\t\t​NOTE: The cDNA can be stored at -20 °C for several weeks. Perform a non-reverse transcriptase (NRT) control for genomic contamination from putative intron-retention events discrimination.\n6. pMTE1A minigene PCR\nPerform PCR with the reaction composition (1.5 mM of MgCl2, 0.3 mM of dNTP mix, 0.5 µM of each primer, 2.5 U of a hot-start Taq Polymerase and 150 ng of cDNA) with the following conditions:\n\t94 °C for 2 min, 29 cycles of: 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 2 min, ​72 °C for 2 min, 72 °C for 10 min.\nLoad 20-25 µL of the PCR product in a 3% agarose gel containing nucleic acid stain and run at 100 V for approximately 1 h.\n7. Analysis of the gel using an image processing and analysis software32\nAfter the run, photograph the gel (using a gel imaging acquisition system) avoiding any band saturation and quantify the bands using an image processing software.\nFor quantification consider the bands at ~631 bp, ~493 bp, and ~156 bp to correspond to the 13S, 12S and 9S isoforms, respectively.\nFrom the software's File menu, open the image file obtained from the imaging acquisition system. Convert to greyscale, adjust brightness and contrast and remove outlier noise if necessary.\nDraw a rectangle around the first lane with the Rectangle Selection tool and select it through the Analyze | Gels | Select First Lane command, or by pressing the keyboard shortcut for it.",
    "Use the mouse to click and hold in the middle of the rectangle on the first lane and drag it over to the next lane. Go to Analyze | Gels | Select Next Lane, or press the available shortcut. Repeat this step to all remaining lanes.\nAfter all the lanes are highlighted and numbered, go to Analyze | Gels | Plot Lanes to draw a profile plot of each lane.\nWith the Straight-line selection tool, draw a line across the base of each peak corresponding to each band, leaving out the background noise. After all the peaks, from every lane, has been closed off, select the Wand tool and click inside each peak. For each peak that highlighted, measurements should pop up in the Results window that appears.\nSum the intensity from all the 3 bands for each sample and calculate the percentage for each isoform relative to the total.\nPlot the percentages of each isoform or the differences in the percentage relative to untreated samples.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the sum of three E1A variants must be equal to 100%.\nSubscription Required.
