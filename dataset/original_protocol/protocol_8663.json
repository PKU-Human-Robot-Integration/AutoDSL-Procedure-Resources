  "procedures": [
    "The following protocol complies with all the animal care guidelines of The University of Sheffield and Beijing Normal University.\n1. Reagents and Equipment Preparation\nRecording and Light Stimulation Equipment Setup\nChoose at least a 2.5 x 2.5 m recording area for performing electrophysiological experiments in a room that has air conditioning with regulated humidity and means to provide dark recording conditions. Ensure that this area is large enough to comfortably fit a : (i) 1 x 1 m vibration-isolation table that houses the rig [fly stimulation and recording apparatus], stereomicroscope and a cold light source with two goose necks, all enclosed within a large >180 cm tall Faraday cage; (ii) a 38U equipment rack for housing a personal computer with a flat LCD monitor, microelectrode amplifier, LED drivers, filters, temperature control units, oscilloscopes and other required electrical instruments; and (iii) a small desk and a chair for the investigator.\nPlace the rig far away from electrical and mechanical noise sources, such as refrigerators, centrifuges and elevators. Use separate surge protectors to protect the rig's electrical devices from voltage spikes occurring in the mains. Ideally, connect the rig to its own uninterruptible power supply (UPS battery) to minimize noise.\nConstruct a conical fly-holder out of brass and black plastic (Figure 2). Drill a small tapering hole through the brass unit with its external rim narrowing to ~0.8 mm diameter (matching a typical fly's thorax width).\n\t\tNote: This hole needs to taper toward the tip of the fly-holder so that a larger than average Drosophila, which is projected from below by airflow, would get stuck shoulder-deep at the top rim.",
    "Design and build a mechanically-robust, yet precise, fly stimulation and recording apparatus (Figure 3). Construct out of aluminum or brass (high conductivity metals) a fly preparation platform pole and around it a Cardan-arm system, with embedded ball bearings, to provide smooth and accurate x,y-positioning and locking of the light stimulus.\n\t\tNote: This integrated composite design minimizes mechanical vibrations, which could otherwise dislodge the recording electrode tip out from the studied cell. It can further incorporate a Peltier-element-based close-loop temperature control system, enabling investigators to use temperature-sensitive genetic constructs, such as shibireTS, for assessing synaptic circuit computations9,30. Anodize the apparatus or paint it black to minimize light stimulus scatter.\n\t\t\nFix the fly stimulation and recording apparatus on the anti-vibration table's breadboard; for example by M6-bolts, using its metric screw holes. Use a black breadboard or cover it with black fabric to minimize light scatter during experiments.\nPosition and lock (using a locking screw) a vertically adjustable fly preparation platform pole at center of a Cardan-arm system. Place the fly-preparation (within the fly-holder, see step 2) on the platform pole so that the light source attached to the Cardan-arm radially points to the fly's head. Ensure that the center of the fly eyes is exactly at the intersection point (0, 0) of the Cardan-arm's x- and y-axes, as this enables accurate x,y-positioning of the light stimulus to any point within the fly's visual field.\n\t\t\tNote: This functionality is necessary for mapping the response properties of individual cells to specific eye locations; e.g., when searching for electrophysiological evidence for structural adaptations, such as bright or acute zones, which would show increasing sensitivity or resolution, respectively31.\nMount the stereomicroscope behind the fly stimulation and recording apparatus on the anti-vibration table so that it provides comfortable high magnification viewing of the fly eye.",
    "Mount the cold light source on the top of the microscope with the light source's dual head semi-rigid gooseneck light guides pointing down toward the fly preparation holder. Freely movable two beam illumination makes it easier to visualize the recording electrode tip when driving it through a small opening into the fly eye.\nAttach an appropriate x,y,z-micromanipulator set (coarse & fine) for the recording electrode and the head-stage on the anti-vibration table, at the right side of the fly stimulation and recording apparatus, using M6-bolts or magnetic stands.\n\t\tNote: In the Juusola laboratory, different rigs are equipped with different manipulators; for details see the Table of Materials and Reagents. These all provide high-quality intracellular recordings.\nMount a small manual 3-axis micromanipulator for the reference electrode holder on the vertically adjustable fly preparation platform pole. Orient the reference electrode so that it is pointing toward the fly preparation.\nConstruct a free-standing light-shielded Faraday cage out of steel-panels around the anti-vibration table, surrounding the fly stimulation and recording apparatus, to prevent outside electromagnetic interference. Leave the front of the cage open, providing access to transport the fly preparation for the experiments. Attach black fabric curtains (having copper- or aluminum-mesh implanted inside them for grounding) at the front to shield out noise and light. Paint the interior of the cage black to minimize light scatter and bolt the feet of the cage on the floor to prevent vibrations.\nConnect the voltage and current outputs of the high-impedance intracellular microelectrode amplifier to the inputs of two separate low-pass filters (Bessel or similar) using BNC-cables. Likewise, connect the filter outputs into the appropriate channels of the AD-connector blocks/boards of the data acquisition system (DA/AD cards). Connect the DA/AD card(s) into a personal computer by specialized cables, according to supplier manuals.",
    "Install appropriate acquisition software for the data acquisition system of choice on the personal computer. Ensure that the data acquisition drivers are compatible with the operating system on the personal computer.\nGround electrically the fly stimulation and recording apparatus, Faraday cage, copper mesh (within the curtains), microscope, micromanipulators, cold light source, 38U equipment rack with all its instruments (the intracellular amplifier, filters, temperature control unit, PC and LCD monitor etc.) to a single central ground point by using equipment grounding wire and M6 crimp ring grounding ends. Use an electric multimeter to test that all the parts are in the same ground.\n\t\tNote: To achieve the best possible low-noise recording conditions, the grounding configurations typically vary from one set-up to another.\n\t\t\nIf needed, connect the central ground point further to the building ground, and/or the microelectrode amplifier's central ground. After testing the fully functioning system during real electrophysiological experiments, be prepared to change the grounding configuration as needed to minimize noise in the recordings.\nConfigure software amplification (1 - 10X), signal filtering (typically low-pass filters set at 500 Hz, which is suitable for both R1-R6 and LMC data), and sampling rate (at least 1 KHz). Ensure that the settings obey Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem32; for example, when acquiring data that is low-pass-filtered at 500 Hz, use a sampling frequency of 1 kHz or higher to minimize aliasing effects.\n\t\t\nAs characteristic voltage responses of R1-R6 photoreceptors are 40 - 65 mV, and those of LMCs 20 - 45 mV, set the amplification and display scales accordingly to enable high-resolution sampling and data visualization.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54142/54142fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Conical Fly-holder. The fly-holder is made out of two pieces: the central brass unit and its conical black plastic coat. The central hole inside the brass unit tapers to a small diameter that barely lets the fly through.

The set-up contains a free-standing light-shielded Faraday cage, the anti-vibration table, the fly stimulation and recording apparatus, and black fabric curtains with copper- or aluminum-mesh inside for grounding. The instrument rack is electrically connected to the same central ground with all the equipment inside the Faraday cage. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54142/54142fig3large.jpg]\nFabricating Microelectrodes\nPull the reference microelectrode from filamented borosilicate (outer diameter: 1.0 mm; inner diameter 0.6 mm) or quartz glass (outer diameter: 1.0 mm; inner diameter 0.5, 0.6 or 0.7 mm) tubing using a pipette puller instrument. Try to achieve a short gradual taper.\n\t\tNote: The exact settings of the pipette puller program vary from instrument to instrument; more details in the Table of Materials and regents. The pore size at the tip is not crucial because the tip of the reference electrode will be broken before being inserted into the fly preparation.\nPull the recording microelectrode from filamented borosilicate (outer diameter: 1.0 mm; inner diameter 0.6 mm) or quartz glass (outer diameter: 1.0 mm; inner diameter 0.5, 0.6 or 0.7 mm) tubing using a pipette puller instrument. Try to achieve a long (10 - 15 mm) fine gradual taper.\nInspect with a light microscope that the recording electrodes show correct tapering. Mount the electrode on a glass slide with moldable adhesive and use 40X air objective to inspect its tip.",
    "Note: A good electrode tapers smoothly until its invisibly small tip, around which continuous parallel darker and lighter interference patterns can be seen. Some puller settings generate high resistance electrodes, which cannot yield successful cell penetrations because their tips resemble \"trumpets\". Thus, visual inspection of the electrodes is important.\nAttach the electrodes horizontally on a large Petri-dish with modelling clay (or similar moldable adhesive) for safe-keeping and transportation to the electrophysiology rig. Ensure that the electrode tips are always in the air and not accidentally touching anything.\nBack-fill the recording and reference electrodes just before the experiment with the appropriate salt solution. Use a small 5 ml syringe connected to a small particle filter with a fine plastic tip (such as a microloader).\n\t\t\nFor photoreceptors experiments, fill the recording electrode until full (a droplet forms in its large end) with 3 M KCl as this solution minimizes the effect of liquid junction potential to the recorded voltage.\nFor investigating the histaminergic LMCs, which respond to synaptic input from R1-R6 photoreceptors by chloride-conductance changes, fill the recording electrodes with 3 M potassium acetate and 0.5 mM KCl, as this solution has less effect on the cell's chloride battery. Fill the reference electrode with fly Ringer, containing in mM: 120 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 TES (C6H15NO6S), 1.5 CaCl2, 4 MgCl2, and 30 sucrose5.\nTest the resistance of a newly pulled recording electrode in the recording system.\n\t\t\nEnsure that the silver wires inside the electrode-holders are evenly coated with silver chloride (appearing purple-grey - not shiny silvery) to minimize recording artefacts (such as drift in the junction potential). If not, replace them with properly chloridized wires.",
    "If needed, chloridize new silver wires. Carefully clean the wires (by quickly passing them through a flame) so that these appear bright silver in color. Avoid touching them with the fingers, in order to deposit on an even layer of AgCl. Soak the wires in full strength household bleach for 15 - 30 min until they appear purple-gray color. Alternatively, electroplate each wire (by making it positive with respect to a solution containing 3 M KCl and passing a current through it at a rate of 1 mA/cm2 of surface area) for 10 - 15 sec until adequately coated.\nConnect the back-filled recording and reference electrodes to their electrode-holders. Place a small Ringer's solution bath on the vertically adjustable fly preparation platform pole. Drive the electrode tips into the Ringer's solution and measure the recording electrode's tip resistance.\n\t\t\tNote: This step is only needed when testing the resistive properties of electrodes, which are pulled from a new batch of glass tubing, or when optimizing the microelectrode puller instrument programs through iteration.\nBefore performing the resistance measurements, read the instructions in the amplifier manufacture's user manual for the appropriate measurement settings. For a good recording electrode, have a tip resistance of ~100 - 220 MΩ.\n2. Drosophila Preparation \nCollect 5 - 10 days old flies (after eclosion) and place them in a clean fly tube containing standard food. It is possible to achieve good recordings from younger flies too, even from the \"newborns\"; but because of their softer eyes, cutting a corneal opening for the recording electrode is more difficult.\nConstruct a fly catching tube and a fly preparation stand (Figure 4). See Figure 4 for the general idea of how these self-made tools were put together.",
    "To make a fly catching tube, cut off the tip of 50 ml plastic centrifuge tube's conical bottom. Then, insert and glue the large end of 1 ml pipette tip on this new opening.\nFinally, cut the small end of pipette to a size that readily lets a fly to walk through. Consult a mechanical workshop to assemble a small fly preparation stage that enables 2-axes rotation and locking of the fly-holder to different positions.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54142/54142fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Tools and Devises Needed for Making the Fly Preparation. Fly catching tube is made by gluing a 1 ml plastic pipette tip to a 50 ml plastic centrifuge tube. Bespoke fly preparation stand enables free-rotation and locking of the fly-holder in a preferred position for preparing the fly. The fly is fixed by beeswax, using the electric wax-heater. Petroleum jelly is applied by a small applicator made by connecting a thick sort hair on a handle. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54142/54142fig4large.jpg]\nCollect a fly for the experiment in a 1 ml pipette tip, which barely enables a fly to fit through. Attach the fly catching tube, with the pipette tip on it, to the fly tube. In catching a fly, take advantage of their inherent tendency to climb upwards (antigravitaxis) into the pipette tip. Preferably, select the biggest female, as size matters in electrophysiology.\n\tNote: The bigger the fly, the bigger its cells and the better the chances for high quality intracellular recordings. Smaller flies (both females and males) can also provide excellent recordings, but the preparation is more difficult to make. Once the fly is trapped in a large pipette tip, remember to close the fly tube to stop other flies from escaping.",
    "Connect a 100 ml syringe with a flexible plastic hose to the larger opening of the pipette tip - with the fly still in it.\nPlace the narrow end on the large pipette tip, which is enlarged just to let a Drosophila through, to the opening in the bottom of the fly-holder and squeeze a small volume of air from the syringe to eject the fly into the fly-holder.\n\t\nLook through the stereomicroscope and gently administer more air until the fly's head is protruding from the conical end of the fly-holder. Ensure that the fly is firmly trapped from its thorax to the small opening on the top of the fly-holder.\nUse a wax heater to fasten the fly with beeswax from its \"shoulders\" to the fly-holder. Adjust the temperature of the wax heater to be as low as possible yet cleanly melting the wax.\n\tNote: When the temperature is correct, the wax appears transparent. Too high of a temperature makes the wax \"burn away\"; too low keeps the wax stiff. When fixing the fly, be accurate and brief as prolonged heat exposure may damage it. Using light-cured dental glue is not recommended here as its application is too slow.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54142/54142fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Preparing the Fly for In Vivo Experiments. Left, A Drosophila's head is positioned straight in the fly-holder and fixed from its proboscis, right eye and shoulders to the fly-holder with heated beeswax. Right, A small opening is cut in the thickest part of the eye, just above the equator and only a few ommatidia away from the back cuticle, using a sharp razor edge. A piece of cornea is gently removed and the hole is sealed with petroleum jelly to prevent the eye from drying up. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54142/54142fig5large.jpg]",
    "Immobilize the fly's head. Apply beeswax to the proboscis (Figure 5) and the corner of the right eye, avoiding the cornea, and fix the head from these points to the fly-holder.\nProduce a micro-knife. Clamp a non-stainless-steel razorblade with two blade-holders/breakers (both with flat grip) and crack a small strip of its sharp edge. For health and safety, use goggles for eye protection (even though it is highly unlikely that pieces would ricochet when the razor is cracked). Ideally, produce a sharp razor edge that resembles a spire. Ensure that this \"spire\" is firmly attached to the blade-holder, but be careful to avoid any self-injury!\nUsing the micro-knife, prepare a small opening size of few ommatidia in the fly's left eye - at about 4 - 5 ommatidia from the dorsal cuticle just above the eye's equator to provide the passage for the recording microelectrode. Perform under a stereomicroscope, viewing the preparation with high magnification.\n\tNote: Because the fly eye feels elastic and resistive to probing, the hole is best cut with a \"spire\"-knife. The cutting technique is quite challenging, so pay close attention to the video demonstration. Keeping the fly-holder in certain orientations (in the fly preparation stand) can make the dissection easier. Initially, the microsurgery may feel difficult to learn, but once committed, neural adaptation gradually improves the investigator's 3D-perception and dexterity.\nRemove carefully the small piece of cornea from the opening that was just cut, exposing the retina underneath. Swiftly cover the hole in the eye with a tiny blob of petroleum jelly using the fine hair of the petroleum jelly applicator.",
    "Note: Petroleum jelly serves multiple roles here. It prevents tissue dehydration and coagulation of the hemolymph that would break the inserted recording electrode. It also incidentally coats the microelectrode, reducing its intramural capacitance. This can improve the frequency response of the recording system, and so the temporal resolution of the recorded neural signals. Avoid smearing petroleum jelly over the rest of the eye as this blurs the optics.\n3. Recording from R1-R6 Photoreceptors or LMCs \nAlways be grounded when operating the microelectrode amplifier (for example by touching the metal surface of the Faraday cage or anti-vibration table), as this precludes one from accidentally delivering a static charge to the head-stage, which could damage the circuitry.\nIlluminate the fly preparation platform pole from above by two goose-neck light guides (Figure 6A) (with the cold light source inside the Faraday cage) so that the fly-holder can be placed on the pole in the preferred position under close visual control.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54142/54142fig6.jpg",
    "Figure 6. Positioning the Fly-holder and the Electrodes for the Experiments. (A-B) The fly-holder is placed on the recording platform that also provides temperature control via a Peltier element (A: white round platform in the center). The Cardan-arm enables exact positioning of the light stimulus at an equal distance (via x,y-rotation) around the fly, with the light source (a liquid or quartz fiber-optic bundle end) directly pointing to its eye. In many of our rigs, light stimulation is generated by LEDs (with linear current-drivers) or by a monochromator. Thus, their stimuli carry a specific (band-passed) spectral content, selected between 300 - 740 nm and cover 4 - 6 log intensity unit range (as attenuated by separate neutral density filters). (C) Two microelectrodes, controlled by separate micromanipulators, are positioned in the fly head: the reference electrode (above) through the ocelli; the recording electrode (left) through the small opening in the left eye. (D) For obtaining a maximum number of photoreceptor recordings, the recording microelectrode is driven into the hole, parallel to the proboscis-ocellus axis. When the electrode tip penetrates and seals to a photoreceptor, the freely rotatable light source is fixed to the position where the cell produces the maximum voltage response to a given light stimulus. This point in space lies in the center of the cell's receptive field. If the hole is close to the cuticle, LMC penetrations can further be achieved with this same electrode angle (left). If the hole is further from the cuticle, another useful electrode approach angle to obtain LMC recordings is also shown (right). Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54142/54142fig6large.jpg]",
    "Mount the fly-holder (with the fly in it!) on the fly preparation platform pole. Rotate the fly-holder so that the fly's left eye is directly facing the investigator (Figure 6B).\nInsert the blunt reference electrode gently through the fly's occelli into the head capsule using a small coarse micromanipulator while observing the preparation through the stereomicroscope ( Figure 6C). Do not push the electrode too deep, as this can damage the fly brain.\n\t\nAlternatively, insert the reference electrode into the back of the thorax. Always, ensure that the fly appears heathy (moves its antennae) and its eyes are intact; not accidentally damaged. If the preparation looks less than immaculate, prepare a new fly for the experiments.\nDrive the sharp recording microelectrode into the left eye through the petroleum jelly covered small opening prepared earlier. Use high magnification in the stereomicroscope and move the light guides and the focal plane so that the electrode tip location becomes apparent in 3D by its reflectance patterns.\n\tNote: Figure 6D shows how the fly's head should be positioned slightly differently (in respect to the angle the recording microelectrode enters the eye) for photoreceptor and LMC recordings. Driving the electrode into the eye without breaking it is the most difficult phase of the experiment. If the electrode tip misses the small opening in the eye, hitting the cornea, it typically breaks.\nTurn on the microelectrode amplifier once both electrodes are firmly inside the preparation, in electrical contact with the fly's body fluids.",
    "Turn off the cold-light source (inside the Faraday cage) and unplug it from the mains. Connect its plug to the central ground to minimize ground-loop induced electrical noise, and move the goose-neck light guides away so that the Cardan-arm system can be freely moved around the fly. Switch off the room lights to ensure that the fly preparation is now in relative darkness.\nMeasure the resistance of the recording electrode in the eye (as instructed in the amplifier's user manual). Use only recording electrodes in which resistance is 100 - 250 MΩ.\n\tNote: It is virtually impossible to achieve high quality intracellular recordings by <70 MΩ electrode. If the resistance is <80 MΩ, it is likely that the electrode tip is broken. In this case, switch off the amplifier and change the recording electrode.\n\t\nOnce the electrode is replaced and in the eye, switch on the amplifier to measure its resistance. Sometimes, the electrode tip can become blocked by some detritus as it enters the tissue. This can be remedied by using the amplifier's capacitive buzz and current pulse functions that typically clear it by rapid resonation or repulsion.\nSet the amplifier to current-clamp (CC) or bridge recording mode. Cancel out any arbitrary voltage difference between the recording and reference electrodes, as both of them are now resting in the electrically interconnected extracellular space, by setting the signal offset (recording voltage) to zero. Follow the signal offset changes using the amplifier's display readout or an oscilloscope screen.\nWait 2-3 min for the fly eye to dark-adapt.\nDrive the recording electrode tip gradually deeper into the eye with small 0.1 to 1 micron steps. Do this with an x-axis piezo-stepper of a remote-controlled micromanipulator or by gently rotating the fine resolution knob of a manual manipulator.",
    "Stimulate the fly eye with brief (1 - 10 msec) light flashes as the recording electrode is being advanced in the tissue.\n\tNote: If the recording electrode is positioned in the retina and the eye functions normally, each light flash will cause a brief and small drop in the voltage (0.2 - 5 mV hyperpolarization), called the electroretinogram (ERG). This change in the field potential of the extracellular space is caused by the retinal cells' collective response to light. However, once the electrode tip enters the lamina, closing on the LMCs, the ERG reverses, showing depolarizing responses.\nMove the light source around the fly eye by using the Cardan-arm system and find the position where the light evokes the largest ERG response.\n\tNote: This position marks the small area in the visual space where the photoreceptors (or LMCs), which are located next to the tip of the recording electrode, sample their light input.\nPenetrate a cell with the recording electrode.",
    "Note: The penetration can occur spontaneously, or when the electrode is micro-stepped forward. It can be further facilitated by gently tapping the micromanipulator system or by using the buzz-function of the amplifier; these actions resonate the electrode tip in the tissue. When the electrode impales the photoreceptor membrane, entering its intracellular space, the voltage difference between the recording and reference electrode drops suddenly from 0 mV to ~-65 mV (between -55 and -75 mV); whereas during LMC penetrations, this drop is typically less (between -30 and -50 mV). These voltage differences represent the negative resting potentials of the given cells. Depending on the quality of the recording electrode (its sharpness) and the cellular process it penetrated, the voltage reading from the recording electrode can stabilize rapidly or gradually to the resting potential, as the cell membrane seals to the outer layer of the electrode. But if the penetration is only partial or poor, the electrode typically slips out of the cell with the recorded potential climbing back towards zero.\nLocalize the center of the penetrated cell's receptive field when the electrode appears properly sealed, showing stable membrane potential (dark resting potential). Move the flashing light stimulus around the fly eye, using the Cardan-arm system, to find the point in visual space, where the light flash evokes the cell's maximum voltage response. Lock the Cardan-arm when the light stimulus directly faces (points at) the receptive field center.",
    "Note: In darkness, Drosophila photoreceptors respond to bright light pulses with 40 - 65 mV depolarizing voltage responses4,5, while stable LMC recordings show 20 to 45 mV hyperpolarizing responses9,10,14. Glia penetrations may happen rarely, indicated by <-80 mV resting potentials and much slower and smaller (~5 mV) saturated light-induced depolarizations. Photoreceptors in Drosophila with different eye pigmentations, such as white-eye7 and cinnabar, show comparable response sizes to wild-type.\nUsing the amplifier's current-clamp (CC) mode, compensate the recording electrode's capacitance by injecting small 0.1 nA and brief (100 - 200 msec) current pulses into the studied cell to minimize recording artefacts during its membrane charging.\n\tNote: This important procedure is explained in detail in the amplifier's user manual, and should be practiced with an electrical cell model before the actual experiments.\nRecord voltage responses to light pulses and other stimuli of interest, having varying statistical or physical qualities (such as naturalistic light intensity time series or random contrast patterns). Test, for example, how the recorded responses change with light- or dark-adaptation.\n\tNote: One can accurately light-adapt the studied cell by continuous light of preselected intensity by adding neutral density filters on the light path4,5. Alternatively, for prolonged dark-adaptation switch off the light stimulus for a preset time. Because of the mechanical stability of the recording system, the high quality of the recording electrodes and the intactness of the preparation, stable recording conditions can sometimes last for many hours. Thus, on a good day, it is possible to collect a large amount of data at different adapting conditions from a single cell. When the electrode slips out of the cell, the recorded responses diminish and the mean voltage begins to approach zero.",
    "Advance carefully the recording electrode with the fine x-axis control of the micromanipulator until the electrode makes contact and penetrates the next cell (this is typically the nearest neural neighbor). Do not move the electrode along y- or z-axis as these maneuvers would make the electrode to \"plough the tissue\" sideways, damaging eye structures!\n\tNote: With a good electrode and a healthy preparation, one can record high quality responses from many photoreceptors (but rarely from many LMCs) in the same fly over a period of several hours; occasionally, over the whole working day (>8 hr) without clear signal deterioration.\nSave data files periodically with identifying information, such as date, genotype, and the recorded cell type. Because of the large amount of data that can be collected in a successful recording session, keep good written records in a lab-book for future data analysis."
