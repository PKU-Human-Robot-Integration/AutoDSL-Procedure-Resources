    "Ethics Statement: All protocols involving animals were approved by the Comité de Protection des Animaux de l'Université Laval and were made in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care's Guide to the Care and Use of Experimental Animals (Ed. 2). The protocol described here was optimized for adult animals of approximately 800 g. The volumes of fixative should be adjusted according to the animal's size.\n1. Preparation of Solutions for Transcardiac Perfusion\nPrepare 1 L of a 50 mM sodium Phosphate-buffered Saline (PBS) solution according to the following steps. Prepare the solution at most 24 h before perfusion and keep at 4 °C until use.\n\t\nMeasure 800 mL of distilled water in a 1 L beaker. Add 5.87 g of dibasic anhydrous sodium phosphate (Na2HPO4), 1.20 g of monobasic monohydrate sodium phosphate (NaH2PO4·H2O), and 9 g of sodium chloride (NaCl). Stir to dissolve.\nAdjust the pH to 7.4 by gradually adding 5 N NaOH. Add distilled water to reach a total volume of 1 L.\n\t\tCAUTION: NaOH is a corrosive chemical compound. Wear the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE; laboratory coat, gloves, protective goggles, etc.).\nPrepare 2 L of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) according to the following steps. This solution should be prepared at most 24 h before surgery and kept at 4 °C until use.\n\t\nMeasure 1.5 L of distilled water in a 2-L beaker. Add 23.48 g of dibasic anhydrous sodium phosphate (Na2HPO4) and 4.80 g of monobasic monohydrate sodium phosphate (NaH2PO4·H2O). Stir to dissolve. Add distilled water to reach a total volume of 2 L.\nHeat the solution under a venting hood until the temperature reaches approximately 45 - 55 °C. Do not heat to over 60 °C.",
    "Gradually add 80 g of PFA to the solution and stir until completely dissolved (approximately 30 - 60 min). Keep monitoring the temperature to keep it below 60 °C.\n\t\tCAUTION: PFA is highly volatile in its powder form. It is highly toxic if in contact with eyes or skin and is hazardous in case of inhalation or ingestion. Wear PPE and use with caution under a venting hood.\nCool the solution down to 4 °C and filter. Store at 4 °C.\nPrepare 1 L of 3% acrolein in 0.1 M Phosphate Buffer (PB) according to the following steps. The PB solution should be prepared at most 24 h prior to perfusion.\n\tCAUTION: Acrolein is highly toxic if inhaled and can produce immediate damage. It is also corrosive and highly toxic if absorbed through the skin. It is carcinogen and mutagenic. Wear the appropriate PPE and use under a venting hood.\n\t\nMeasure 800 mL of distilled water. Add 8.66 g of dibasic anhydrous sodium phosphate (Na2HPO4) and 5.38 g of monobasic monohydrate sodium phosphate (NaH2PO4·H2O). Stir until all the salts dissolve. Add distilled water to reach a total volume of 1 L. Keep the solution at 4 °C.\nBefore surgery, transfer 900 mL of the PB solution to a 1 L glass container and add 30.94 mL of 97% acrolein solution under a venting hood. Add PB solution to reach a total volume of 1 L and stir. Filter the solution and keep it at 4 °C.\n2. Transcardiac Perfusion and Brain Dissection",
    "Keep solutions on ice during the entire surgical procedure. Prepare the pump by placing the tube in the first solution to be used (PBS; 50 mM) and turning the pump on until no air remains in the hose. For the transcardiac perfusion of a macaque monkey, use a 21 G needle and set the outflow at approximately 80 mL/min.\nAnesthetize the animal with an intramuscular injection of a mixture of ketamine (20 mg/kg), xylazine (4 mg/kg), and acepromazine (0.5 mg/kg). Maintain the animal under isoflurane (3%) sedation.\nAttach the animal's limbs to a venting table.\nWith a scalpel, remove the skin up to the armpits. Cut the abdominal muscles. Use heavy-duty surgical scissors to cut the ribs laterally by carefully avoiding the vital organs.\nCut the diaphragm with surgical scissors and raise the rib cage to expose the heart. Once the diaphragm is cut, proceed quickly, since the heart will stop beating within minutes.\nRemove the pericardium with a scalpel blade and insert the needle into the left ventricle. With a scalpel, carefully make a small excision to the right atrium. Quickly start the pump at 72 mL/min and hold the needle in place. If possible, tilt the animal in order to have its head on a lower level than the heart.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to pierce the interventricular septum when inserting the needle.\n\t\nRinse the blood with approximately 300 mL of PBS until the lungs are white and no blood comes out of the right atrium.\nStop the pump, quickly transfer the hose/tube to the 3% acrolein solution, and start the pump again. Gradually increase the pumping speed to 80 mL/min once the heart has stopped beating. Perfuse approximately 500 mL of the acrolein solution.",
    "Stop the pump, quickly transfer the hose to the 4% PFA solution, and start the pump again. This step requires approximately 1 L of PFA.\n\tNOTE: The fixation is complete when the forelimbs are rigid and the neck is stiff.\nCut the head and carefully dissect the brain out of the skull. Take care to not damage the brain with the surgical instruments. The perfusion is optimal when the brain is pale (no trace of blood) and rigid (Figure 1A).\nImmerse the intact brain in 4% PFA for 1 h at 4 °C.\nSerially cut the brain with a cooling vibratome (4 °C) in the desired plane into 50 µm thick sections and collect them in PBS (0.1 M) (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: This step can be carried out in many ways according to the desired protocol. Hemispheres can be separated prior to vibratome cutting, or kept whole. If the brain is too large for the vibratome platform, it can be cut into smaller blocks. After this step, sections can be stored for a long period of time at -30 °C in an antifreeze solution made of 40% PB (50 mM), 30% glycerol, and 30% ethylene glycol.\n3. Pre-embedding Immunohistochemistry (Figure 1C)\nPrepare a 4 L stock solution of Tris-buffered Saline (TBS, 50 mM, pH 7.6) as follows.\n\t\nMeasure 2L of distilled water in a 4 L beaker, add 24.23 g of trihydroxymethyl aminomethane (THAM; C4H11NO3), and stir to dissolve.\nAdjust the pH to 7.6 with approximately 148 mL of 1 N HCl. The acid should be added with caution to avoid reaching a pH below 7.6. The total volume should be 4 L.\n\t\tCAUTION: HCl is highly corrosive. Wear the appropriate PPE.\nSelect sections (from step 2.11) containing the region of interest to be processed for EM immunohistochemistry.",
    "Wash the free-floating sections 3x in PBS (0.1 M, pH 7.4) for 5 min at RT to rinse the antifreeze solution.\nPrepare a 0.5% solution of NaBH4 diluted in PBS.\n\t\nWeigh 0.05 g of NaBH4 and dilute it in 10 mL of PBS. Do not cover. Prepare this solution just before use.\nIncubate the sections in the freshly prepared NaBH4 solution for 30 min at RT. Rock gently. Do not cover.\nWash 3x in PBS for 10 min at RT, rocking vigorously until none of the reaction gas remains.\nPrepare a blocking solution for EM with 2% appropriate normal serum and 0.5% cold fish gelatin diluted in PBS.\n\tNOTE: The quantity should be calculated in order to have enough for the following three steps. Use a serum made from the same animal species hosting the secondary antibody. Avoid the use of antigen retrieval methods or addition of small amounts of triton (to increase the penetration of antibodies), as these methods significantly compromise the quality of the tissue.\nIncubate the sections in the blocking solution for 1 h at RT. Rock gently.\nPrepare primary antibody solution diluted in the blocking solution.\n\tNOTE: The concentration of the primary antibody is usually the same as for LM immunohistochemistry, but consider conducting tests with different antibody concentrations beforehand, as some primary antibodies may not work with acrolein. If so, it is possible to use a mix of glutaraldehyde (0.1 - 2%) and 4% PFA for transcardiac perfusion and obtain similar results. Optimize the incubation time and temperature as well.\nIncubate the sections in primary antibody solution overnight at RT with gentle rocking. Use a previously tested incubation time and temperature.\nWash the sections 3x in PBS for 5 min at RT with gentle rocking.",
    "Prepare a 1:1,000 solution of biotinylated secondary antibody diluted in the blocking solution.\n\tNOTE: The secondary antibody must be raised against the host species used to generate the primary antibody.\nIncubate the sections in secondary antibody solution for 1.5 h at RT. Rock gently.\nPrepare an avidin-biotin-peroxidase (ABC) solution at least 60 min prior to the end of the secondary antibody incubation.\n\t\nUse a calibrated pipette to measure 8.80 µL/mL of solutions A and B and dilute them in PBS.\nRock mildly for at least 60 min at RT to allow the complete binding between the avidin and biotin molecules.\nAfter the incubation in secondary antibody solution, wash 3x in PBS for 10 min at RT.\nIncubate the sections in the ABC solution for 1 h at RT. Rock gently.\nWash once in PBS and twice in TBS for 10 min at RT with gentle rocking.\nPrepare a fresh solution of 0.05% 3,3'-diaminobenzidine (DAB) with 0.005% H2O2 diluted in TBS.\n\t\nWeigh 12.5 mg of DAB and dilute it in 25 mL of cold TBS. Protect from light.\n\t\tCAUTION: The DAB powder is highly volatile and harmful if inhaled. It is carcinogenic and teratogenic. Thus, pregnant or nursing women should not manipulate this product, even when diluted. Use a N95 mask when manipulating and wear PPE.\nFilter the solution and add 4.5 µL of 30% H2O2 just before use.\nIncubate sections in the DAB solution for 3 to 7 min at RT. Rock gently.\n\tNOTE: The brown precipitate should not be too dark in order to avoid a high level of background staining. The incubation time should be optimized accordingly.\nStop the reaction by quickly washing twice in cold TBS, then twice for 10 min in cold TBS at RT, followed by twice for 10 min in PB, with mild rocking.",
    "NOTE: The use of PB (and not PBS) is critical in order to eliminate any traces of NaCl, as it would react with osmium and form crystals.\n4. Osmification and Embedding for Electron Microscopic Observation\nPrepare a solution of 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO4) diluted in PB. Protect from light.\n\tCAUTION: Osmium is highly toxic and should not come in contact with the skin, eyes, or mouth and should not be inhaled. It can cause death if ingested. It should only be used under a venting hood and with appropriate PPE.\nIncubate the sections in OsO4 solution for 30 min at RT under the venting hood (without agitation) and cover them with aluminum foil to protect them from light. Completely flatten the sections prior to adding the OsO4 solution.\n\tNOTE: The sections become very dark and rigid and should be manipulated with care following this step.\nPrepare water-repellent epoxy resin during the osmification.\n\t\nAdd appropriate amounts of each component of the epoxy resin mix (20 g of epoxy resin, 20 g of hardener, 0.6 g of accelerator and 0.4 g of plasticizer) to a large plastic cup. Stir with a wooden stick or plastic pipette until a homogeneous brown color is obtained.\n\t\tNOTE: It is critical to use the exact proportion of each component.\nTransfer equal quantities to aluminum cups of appropriate sizes, depending on the number of sections to be processed. Allow it to rest.\nWash the osmificated sections 3x in PB for 10 min at RT with low-speed rocking.\nDehydrate the sections in the following series of graded ethanol for 2 min each: 2 times in 35% ethanol; 1 time each in 50, 70, 80, 90, and 95% ethanol; and 3x in 100% ethanol.",
    "Transfer the sections to glass vials to complete the dehydration process by incubating the sections 3 times for 2 min in propylene oxide.\n\tCAUTION: Propylene oxide is a highly volatile and toxic organic solvent. It can cause serious damage in the eyes or skin in case of contact or if inhaled or ingested. It has been classified as a grade 2 carcinogenic substance. It should only be used under a venting hood and with PPE. It is also highly flammable and should be kept away from any heat source.\n\tNOTE: Prior to this step, sections should be carefully transferred in glass vials, since propylene oxide is an organic solvent and is incompatible with plastic. At this point, sections are very fragile and should be manipulated with care. Sections can be alternatively transferred to glass vials prior to step 4.5.\nTransfer sections carefully, one by one, in the aluminum cups and avoid contact with air as much as possible. Flat-embed the sections in previously mixed water-repellent epoxy resin and incubate them overnight under the venting hood at RT.\n\tNOTE: At this step, the sections are completely dehydrated and very fragile and should be manipulated with care.\nUsing mineral oil, prepare grease-coated glass slides along with greased plastic coverslips.\nSoften the resin by incubating aluminum cups at 60 °C for 12-15 min at most. Carefully flatten the sections on the greased side of the glass slide. Place the greased coverslip and carefully push out any remaining air.\nIncubate the slides at 60 °C for 48 h.\n\tNOTE: It is critical to not exceed 48 h incubation time, as the resin will become too hard.\nRemove the plastic coverslip.\n5. Sample Preparation for Ultrathin Sectioning and Observation Using a Transmission Electron Microscope",
    "Use binoculars to find the region of interest and cut a small quadrangular piece of approximately 1 mm2 with a scalpel.\nFile the tip of a resin block and glue the quadrangular piece onto it (Figure 1C). Allow the glue to dry for at least 1 h or overnight prior to sectioning.\nUsing an ultramicrotome, cut the quadrangular piece into 80 µm-thick sections (Figure 1D).\n\t\nPlace the resin block in an ultramicrotome deck in the vertical position and, using a sharp razor blade, gradually cut each side of the resin block to form a trapezoid with smooth sides.\nPut the deck in its horizontal position and rotate the block until the longest side of the trapezoid is facing downward.\nUse a diamond trimming tool or a glass knife to trim the surface of the quadrangular piece. Set the ultramicrotome to cut 300 µm thick sections at 1 mm/s. Adjust the knife to be vertically parallel to the quadrangular piece and to display a very small horizontal angle of approximately 1°.\n\t\tNOTE: This angle will allow the user to approach the tissue almost parallel to the surface of the block, where immunolabeled elements are more likely to be found. When using these parameters with the diamond trimming tool, the resin displays a shiny white color. When the tissue is being cut, it changes to a purple or greenish color. \nUse an ultra 45° diamond knife equipped with a boat filled with distilled water to cut 80 µm thick sections, smoothen sections by passing over them with a piece of absorbing paper tipped in xylene, and collect serial sections on formvar-coated nickel slot grids or bare 150 mesh copper grids (Figure 1E).\nPlace the grids in a grid storage box.\nStain the grids with lead citrate.",
    "Use a 5 mL syringe and a 0.2 µm syringe filter to prepare a 1:1 solution of filtered lead citrate stock solution and filtered distilled water. Protect it from light.\n\t\tNOTE: The stock solution of lead citrate should be made fresh every month to avoid the formation of solid deposits. See the material data sheet for the stock recipe. In addition, if many series of grids need to be stained, change the diluted solution when it becomes milky.\nPlace each grid onto a drop of the diluted solution, with the section in contact with the solution. Incubate for 3 min.\nUse small tweezers to hold the grid, and thoroughly rinse it in two beakers containing distilled water.\nRemove excess water by gently using absorbing paper. Store the grids in a grid box. Wait 30 min before examining the sections by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM; Figure 1F).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
