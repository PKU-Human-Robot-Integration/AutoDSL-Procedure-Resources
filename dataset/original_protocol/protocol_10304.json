    "W1118 adult flies and third instar larvae were used for the present study.\n1. Experimental preparation\nNOTE: An open-field arena for Drosophila locomotion tracking is made withacolorless and odorless silica gel.\nMix reagent A and reagent B at a ratio of 1:10, according to the manufacturer's instructions for the silica kit (see Table of Materials). Ensure that sodium bicarbonate is added to the mixture by stirring until the color changes to white. Transfer the mixture to a clean Petri dish and place it in an oven at 40 °C for drying for 48 h.\nSet the HD camera (see Table of Materials) on a tripod, adjusting it so that the camera lens is perpendicular to the surface of the silica arena. Adjusting the focal length and the apertures of the camera, ensure that the camera is focused on the surface of the silica and that the display is adequately illuminated. The experimental setup is illustrated in Figure 1.\nTransfer a fly into the open-field arena to record a continuous video of at least 61 s.\n\tNOTE: Considering the sluggish nature of larvae, a video recording time of more than 10 min is recommended.\n\t\nOpen the video with Fiji, drag the progress bar to the initial frame, and tacitly approve. Choose the whole body of the fly using the \"freehand selection\" tool (Figure 2B,C).\nClick image > adjust > brightness & contrast to adjust the white balance until the gray value of the selected area approaches the broad background (Figure 2D-F).\n\t\t​NOTE: Background homogenization of the first frame enables the software to distinguish the background without any objects and create a contrast when a fly is present, thus allowing the software to track it.",
    "Perform the entire experiment in a testing environment set at 25 °C and 60% relative humidity, in an area that is quiet and devoid of exposure to bright light.\n2. Video recording and preprocessing\nAfter a short period of anesthesia using95%carbon dioxide (CO2), transfer a fly to the open-filed arena and press the record button on the camera application to start video recording.\n\tNOTE: To minimize the effect of the anesthetic on locomotion, allow the flies to recover for 10 min before initiating video recording. Cool-anesthetizing by chilling is also recommended.\n\t\nOnce the flies recover from the anesthesia, put the arena dish containing the fly under the camera and shake the plate quickly from side to side to ensure that the fly is in motion when the recording begins.\nUpon completion of the recording, press the stop button to terminate the video recording.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the video recording time slightly exceeds the destination tracking time by a small margin. In addition, to improve the experimental efficiency, it is possible to track multiple flies spontaneously. This depends on the resolution of the camera to enable a high-quality video crop.\nConvert the recorded videos into AVI format with MJPEG encoding, so they can be opened and analyzed using Fiji. Meanwhile, set the frames per second (fps) rate of the video to 15 fps for adult flies and 12 fps for larvae.\n3. Video analysis\nOpen the video that has been transformed with \"use virtual stack\" and \"convert to grayscale\", two options in the popup window when opening the video with Fiji (Figure 2A).\nMake a blank first frame, as mentioned above.",
    "Obtain a processing window by using the \"set active image\" tool of the AnimalTracker plugin and create a tracking area that circles the arena in the original video window using the \"oval\" tool (Figure 3A).\nSet the filters (Figure 3A,3) and the parameters of the two filters (Figure 4A-G) for the first blank frame in the processing window. Then, select the next frame in the original video window, and choose the filtered surface of the processing window (Figure 5A-C).\n\tNOTE: The filtering step serves to decrease image noise and/or remove the background, thus making it simpler to separate the foreground from the background in the binarization of the frames.\nOnce a filtered processing window is selected, turn the tracked fly with a red profile covered in the processing window by using the \"set threshold\" tool (Figure 3A,4, Figure 5D-E, and Figure 6A).\nUse the \"set blob-detector\" to let the computer recognize the fly with a red profile covered in the processing window (Figure 3A,5 and Figure 6B).\nSet frame 901 as the last frame for the adult fly, calculated by the video's recording duration and fps (Figure 3A,6, Figure 6C).\n\tNOTE: The following experiment with larvae has been tracked for 10 min, so frame 7200 is set as the last frame.\nUse the \"show blobs\" tool to present a tracking rectangle in the original video window (Figure 3A,7 and Figure 6D,E). Then, start the tracking and export the tracking file after the monitoring is completed (Figure 3A,8,9 and Figure 7A,B).\n4. Tracking file analysis\nLoad the track and zone files using the Animal tracker > Tracking analyzer plugin (Figure 8A).\nSelect the desired index using zone settings and alter the parameter settings (Figure 8). Calculate the time of the frame interval using the frame rate.",
    "NOTE: In this condition, the frame rate is 15 fps, and the frame interval is approximately 0.067 s, which is the default setting (Figure 8D).\nProduce the quantitative analysis charts using the spreadsheet software and GraphPad Prism after being analyzed in tracking analyzer (Figure 9).\n5. Analysis per frame\nPerform speed analysis per frame interval. Analyze the track file without Fiji if more detailed research is needed.\n\t\nOpen the track file, copy all coordinates to Microsoft Office Excel, and split the cells using the space key.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, once the file has been divided into \"C\" and \"D\" columns, the speed of Drosophila per frame interval is calculated by the formula SQRT((C5-C4)^2+(D5-D4)^2), which is shown in the \"E\" column (Figure 10A). The data in column \"E\" indicates the number of pixels that the fly moved between two frames, with the first frame not being considered. Select all calculated results and insert a line chart to exhibit an intuitive fly movement speed per frame interval, with a peak on the line chart (Figure 10B).\nCalculate the immobility time per frame interval. After the file has been split into \"C\" and \"D\" columns, calculate the immobility status of Drosophila per frame interval using the formula IF(SQRT((C6-C5)^2+(D6-D5)^2) <20, 0, 1), which is shown in the \"E\" column. (Figure 10C).\n\tNOTE: Unlike speed analysis, the results of the first frame were defined. Flies that moved fewer than 20 pixels were considered immobile and recorded as \"0\" in column \"E\".\n\t\nSelect all calculated results and insert a column chart to visually exhibit the immobility time by the margin of the whole column chart (Figure 10D).\nEnsure that the angle of direction changes.",
    "NOTE: The angle of direction change analysis represents the flies' direction choice. Once the file has been split into \"C\" and \"D\" columns, the angle of direction change is calculated by the formula ACOS(((SQRT((C7-C6)^2+(D7-D6)^2))^2+(SQRT((C6-C5)^2+(D6-D5)^2))^2-(SQRT((C7-C5)^2+(D7-D5)^2))^2)/(2*SQRT((C6-C5)^2+(D6-D5)^2))*(SQRT((C7-C6)^2+(D7-D6)^2)))*180/PI(), which is presented in the \"E\" column (Figure 10E). The calculated results indicates the angle between three coordinates.\n\t\nSelect all calculated results and insert a scatter diagram to illustrate the angle of direction change of the flies' movement (Figure 10F).\nSubscription Required.
