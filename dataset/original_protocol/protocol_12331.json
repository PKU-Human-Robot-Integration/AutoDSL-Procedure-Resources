  "procedures": [
    "All procedures described in this work were performed according to the guidelines recommended by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Johns Hopkins University.\n1. Ahead of Time: Preparation of Instruments, Reagents and Dishes\nPreparation of Eggs: Incubate fertilized White Leghorn chicken eggs at 37.5 °C and 60% relative humidity for 5 days in an egg incubator.\n\tNOTE: An incubator with rocking capacity may be helpful for standardizing and synchronizing embryonic development, but rocking is not strictly necessary for the outcome of this protocol.\nPlasmid Preparation:\n\t\nDesign plasmid construct for gene overexpression or downregulation (for example through the use of RNAi technology1,34) as needed. Include a reporter gene (such as EGFP, RFP or LacZ) in the construct whenever possible.\n\t\tNOTE: Some commonly used promoters such as CMV, can become silenced after time. The CAG promoter (chicken beta-actin promoter with CMV enhancer) is a very good alternative, providing efficient long term expression of the gene of interest35-37.\nPrepare a plasmid solution at a concentration of 1.5 µg/µl in sterile PBS. OPTIONAL: Prepare plasmid solution ahead of time and store it frozen until ready to use.  \n\t\tNOTE: Higher plasmid concentrations do not result in a significant increase in efficiency, whereas using lower plasmid concentrations lower the transfection efficiency1.\nElectrodes:\n\t\nFor the anode use a thick gold tipped electrode (see Table of Specific Materials/ Equipment). Wipe clean with 70% ethanol.\n\t\tNOTE: Insulation of the gold tipped electrode, leaving approximately 0.5 mm exposed, is advisable to minimize leakage of the electric current. Information for insulating material can be found in Table of Specific Materials.",
    "Make a cathode out of a 2.5 mm square box filament, 4.5 mm wide (normally used in micropipette pullers). With the aid of forceps, undo the square box and straighten filament into a long strip. Then, under dissection microscope and using a ruler as a guide, bend the filament into a square 'U' shape 3 mm long at the base and 2 mm high at one side, with the other side the remaining length of the filament (Figure 1, C - D). Using forceps, dip the electrode in 96% ethanol and flame to sterilize. Then attach an electrical lead with a small alligator clip to the longer arm of the electrode.\nElectroporation Chamber Setup:\n\t\nPrepare the electroporation chamber by cutting the lid of a sterile 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and affixing it, flat side down, to a 100 mm Petri dish using tape (Figure 1E).\n\t\tNOTE: Other container in the form of a well of similar size would work; however, a microcentrifuge tube lid is easily accessible and autoclavable. The well must be big enough to house a chick eye and cathode electrode, but not so big as to result in a waste of plasmid solution.\n2. Ex ovo Electroporation Procedure\nPreparation of Instruments:\n\t\nSterilize micro-dissection tools (2 pairs of big curved Moloney forceps for opening egg shells and scooping out embryos, 2 pairs of fine-tip curved Dumont tweezers for removing RPE, one pair of Bonn toothed forceps for removing lens and vitreous) by dipping the tips in 96% ethanol and flaming. Clean dissection scope using wipes dipped in 70% ethanol. Warm a bottle of sterile Calcium-Magnesium-free Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (CMF-HBSS) in a 37 °C water bath. Fill 100 mm sterile Petri dishes to 3/4 full with warm CMF-HBSS.",
    "Place electroporation chamber under another clean dissection microscope and fill with 120 µl of plasmid solution. Connect electrodes to electroporation apparatus, making sure custom-made electrode is connected to the negative pole and gold tipped electrode to the positive pole.\nEmbryo Collection:\n\t\nClean the eggs by wiping shells with wipes wetted in 70% ethanol. Maintain sterile procedure throughout the rest of the protocol to avoid carrying contamination into the cultures. Using big curved Moloney forceps carefully open a hole in the egg shell by gently tapping on the rounded tip of an egg (over the air chamber) and then gripping and pulling out shell pieces.\nWith another pair of forceps remove membranes and collect embryo by scooping it out of the egg (being careful not to damage the embryo). Place it in a dish with CMF-HBSS.\n\t\tNOTE: Collect as many embryos as necessary to obtain the desired number of retinal cups for electroporation as specified in 2.4.4\nCRITICAL STEP: Stage the embryos according to Hamburger and Hamilton38 .\n\t\tNOTE: To obtain optimum efficiency embryos must be at stage 27 (Figure 2A).\nEuthanize the embryos by decapitation using Moloney forceps.\nObtaining Retinal Cups:\n\t\nUsing fine Dumont tweezers, carefully enucleate the eyes and transfer to a new CMF-HBSS dish.\nStarting from the posterior part of each eye, close to the optic nerve head, and using two fine Dumont tweezers, introduce one tip of each pair of tweezers between the neural retina and RPE and carefully dissect out the RPE being cautious to not damage the neural retina (Figure 2B).\n\t\tNOTE: The lack of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the solution will help the RPE detach from the neural retina more easily.\nElectroporation:",
    "Set up electroporator's parameters to deliver 5 square pulses of 15 Volts, 50 msec duration, and 950 msec interval. Place 'U' shaped negative electrode inside electroporation chamber (microcentrifuge lid filled with 120 µl of plasmid-containing solution).\nUsing curved Dumont tweezers transfer one retinal cup to the electroporation chamber (by scooping, not pressing), and place it inside the 'U' shaped electrode, with the posterior part of the retina towards the bottom of the electrode and the lens facing upwards (Figure 2D).\nPlace the anode so that it touches the anterior part of the eye, next to the lens, and using the electroporator's foot pedal deliver the electric pulses.\nTransfer electroporated retinal cup to a new Petri dish with CMF-HBSS and repeat electroporation procedure with each of the remaining retinal cups.\n\t\tNOTE: Up to 6 retinal cups can be electroporated with the same plasmid solution without a significant decrease in transfection efficiency.\nRemove the lens and vitreous body of each electroporated retinal cup by gripping them with Bonn toothed forceps and gently pulling through the pupil opening while holding the eye in place with the back of the curved Dumont tweezers.\nProceed to the dissociation and culture of the electroporated retinal cells following standard procedures.",
    "NOTE: For a detailed protocol on the dissociation and culture of chick retinal cells refer to Vergara and Canto-Soler, 2012, Additional file 421. In this protocol the cells are seeded at low density on polyornithine-coated 6-well plates or 35-mm dishes (6 x 105 cells/35 mm-diameter well or dish). The medium used is medium 199 with penicillin/glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), and linoleic acid-BSA at 100 µg/ml. The cultures are maintained in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Using this procedure, 5 - 6 x 106 cells can typically be obtained per each stage 27 electroporated eye.\n\t\tNOTE: Ideally, no more than 3 hr should pass between embryo collection and cell plating, to ensure good cell survival and minimize stress. A typical timing for observation and further analysis is after 4 days in culture, since at this point the cells have achieved good morphological and molecular differentiation and survival is still high.\nSubscription Required.
