    "1. System Calibration\nPoint Spread Function (PSF) calibration\n\t\nDilute 10 µl of 30 nm fluorescent bead solution (about 5 μM) in 90 µl of distilled water and then sonicate the solution for 20 min. Cut a square (1 cm x 1 cm) piece of agarose gel (3%) and deposit 10 µl of the solution on the top of the gel. Overturn the piece of gel on the bottom glass of a 2 cm Petri dish and squeeze the drop on the glass.\nTurn on the acquisition setup, put the sample in the holder, set the camera exposure and EMgain (100 msec and 1,000 are good parameters but optimize according to the system) and wait for the camera to cool down.\nSet camera exposure to 100 msec, camera EMgain to 1,000, acquisition mode to Frame Transfer, 100 repetition and auto save setting.\nUsing the eyepiece and transmitted light focus on the border of the gel and then move the objective to the center of the gel, adjust the focus and start the laser alignment procedure (in LAS AF, select ‘TIRF setup’ and follow the auto alignment procedure).\nFind a field of view with isolated single spots, accurately focus on the brighter spot (that usually represents beads aggregate) as a reference, acquire 100 frames and repeat the step 5-6 times in order to acquire several single spots.\nImport the acquired series to a data processing program and average the stack in time (Figure 1A) and select a single isolated bead. Take care to select the smallest ones to avoid particle aggregates.",
    "Fit the selected intensity distribution (an example of single beads profile is presented in Figure 1B) with a Gaussian function using the command “gaussfit” (in the ICS-Matlab tools in the Materials in Matlab). Verify the goodness of the fit by inspecting the obtained residuals (an example of fitted Gaussian profile with the corresponding residuals is presented in Figure 1B).\nCamera calibration\n\t\nTurn on camera and wait for the camera to cool down. Set camera acquisition setting, (i.e., for the used camera we set the exposure to 0.5 msec, camera EMgain to 1,000, acquisition mode to Cropped Mode, the ROI size to 32 x 128, 10,000 repetitions) and start the acquisition of the camera background signal.\nImport acquired frame series to a data processing program. Calculate and inspect the average intensity in each pixel in order to verify that the camera background is approximately flat in the selected region of the chip. In Cropped Mode, remove the first and the last few horizontal lines (3 to 10 depending on the size of the ROI) for each frame because the camera background is usually biased in the border lines.\nCreate a histogram of the values (also defined Digital Level, DL) in acquired images stack (using command ‘hist’ in Matlab) and plot the logarithm of resulting frequency (using semilogy command in Matlab). An example of DL distribution for camera background is presented in Figure 2.",
    "NOTE: If the camera is working well, the plot will show an approximately Gaussian peak (a parabolic profile in log-scale) representing the distribution of values associated to zero photon followed by an exponential decay (a line with negative slope in log-scale) that represents the distribution of values associated to 1 photon (Figure 2). In particular, the center and the variance of the Gaussian function represent the camera offset and error, respectively, while the decay constant of the exponential part represents an estimation of the DL assigned by the camera to each single photon. In Matlab use the section “CalibrateCamera” of the Script in supporting materials.\nRepeat the operation for all the selected Camera EMGain and Gain.\n2. Labeled Cell Preparation\nTo prepare the liposomes required for lipid incorporation 36, dissolve separately 1 mg of DOPE (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine), 1 mg of DOTAP (1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane), and 1 mg of PPE-ATTO488 in 1 ml of chloroform. Mix together 0.5 ml of DOPE solution, 0.5 ml of DOTAP solution, and 25 µl of PPE-ATTO488 solution and dry under vacuum for 24 hr. Add 0.5 ml of HEPES buffer 20 mM, vortex for 15 min and sonicate for 15 min at 40 °C.\nTo prepare the cell, wash 3 times with PBS a p100 dish of confluent CHO-K1 (Chinese Hamster Ovary), add 1 ml of trypsin and store in incubator for 5 min. Suspend detached cells adding 9 ml of DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% of FBS and seed 150 µl of cell solution in a Petri dish containing 800 µl of the same medium.",
    "Store in incubator for 24 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2. For lipid incorporation, replace cell medium with 500 µl of serum-free medium; after 30 min, add 2 µl of liposomes solution; after 15 min wash with PSB and add new DMEM/F12 medium for imaging.\nFor Transfection, transfect cells according to Lipofectamine protocol (Manufacturer instructions) using TfR-GFP plasmid and store 24 hr in incubator before imaging.\n3. Data Acquisition\nSetup preparation\n\t\nIn order to thermostat the microscope, 24 hr before the experiment turn on the incubator.\nIn order to apply the fastest achievable acquisition time, work in Cropped Sensor Mode (see introduction) and use a first camera for imaging (camera 1) and second camera to select the cell (camera 2). A scheme of the setup configuration is presented in Supplementary Figure S1. Then, to align the two cameras turn on the microscope and wait for the cameras to cool down.\nSet on both cameras the parameters for transmitted light imaging (i.e., 20 msec for exposure time, 1 for EM Gain) and put the microscope in Bright Field mode.\nPut the samples in the holder and focus using eyepiece, send the light to camera 1 and gently push the slits allowing light only on the ROI used for cell imaging (here a 32 x 32 pixels ROI).\nMove a cell in the selected region and send the light to the camera 2, then draw a ROI in the software that control camera 2 in order to have a reference.\nImaging (Figure 3A)\n\t\nFirst of all, align the TIRF laser according to the procedure of your setup. In our setup, select the ‘TIRF setup’ and start the auto alignment procedure. When the laser is aligned set 70 nm of penetration depth (about 70°).",
    "Set exposure time to 70 msec and EMGain to 100 on both camera 1 and camera 2; then, select a cell using camera 1, then send the light on camera 2 and accurately focus the cell membrane. Set the minimum exposure on camera 2, 1,000 EMGain, Cropped Sensor Mode, 105 repetitions and set autosave as fits files (Flexible Image Transport System, a format that can be easily managed).\nStart the acquisition to record the image series. Release the Gain and the cropped Mode to allow temperature stabilization before acquiring a new cell, then repeat the last two steps in order to acquire 8-10 cells.\n4. Calculation of the Mean Square Displacement from Imaging (iMSD)\nNOTE: The following protocol can be directly applied to raw data. At the same time, the whole protocol is valid for data acquisitions simulated both in Matlab and in SimFCS. The link to the corresponding tutorials can be found in the ‘Materials’ section.\nCalculation by Matlab\n\t\nImport the acquired series to Matlab using ImportImageSeries script. Calculate the average intensity of each image in time using the command mean on the first 2 dimensions and use plot to see the resulting vector.\nIf more than 10% of photobleaching is present, discard the series or remove the first part of them. If it is lower, try to correct the effect on the correlation function by subtracting to each image its average intensity, as shown before37.\nCalculate the average intensity of each pixel by using mean on the third dimension and see resulting image.",
    "NOTE: Particular attention is required in order to avoid artifactual correlations. In fact, as previously shown for similar techniques38, cell borders as well as out of focus vesicles could introduce a strong correlation. If the inspection of the average image reveals cell borders or out of focus vesicles, try to exclude the region involved otherwise discard the acquisition. To correct the effect of this immobile structures subtract the average temporal intensity from each pixel39.\nCalculate the spatiotemporal correlation (G(ξ,χ,τ)) by using the function CalculateSTICScorrfunc. Remove G(ξ,χ,0) because the correlation due to the shot noise in low-light regime dominates G(0,0,0); the correlation due to the detector dominates the G(±1,0,0), and particle movement during the exposure time could deform G(ξ,χ,τ) for τ=0 by increasing the measured waist (this effect disappears for τ>0)34.\nAverage G(ξ,χ,τ>0) using a logarithmic time-bin to reduce the noise by using “LogBinStack” function in Supporting Material and then fit the resulting G(ξ,χ,τ) using the function “gaussfit” of the ICS-Matlab tools in the Materials to recover the iMSD (the second column of the resulting array).\nPlot the obtained waist σ(τ)2 (iMSD) as a function of time. If the data are too noisy, try to increase the number of acquired frames, increase the laser power, average more G(ξ,χ,τ) together.\nCalculation by SimFCS\n\t\nOpen the acquired files with ImageJ using BioFormat importer plugin and save acquired series as Tiff sequence.\nOpen SimFCS and select RICS tool and select File>Import Multiple Images (Supplementary Figure S2).\nSelect Fit, insert the correct acquisition parameters and close the fit window (Supplementary Figure S3).\nSelect Display>Average Intensity>CH1 and verify the presence of photobleaching (Supplementary Figure S4).\nIf more than 10% of photobleaching is present discard the series or if it is possible load again the image sequence removing the first part of the series.",
    "If bleaching it is lower than 10% select Tools>iMSD>Set Parameters, check ‘Use moving average’, set in the ROI panel on the left a number of frame for the moving average paying attention that the correspondent time is higher than the characteristic diffusion time (for particle moving at 1 µm2sec-1 a time of 10 sec is a good moving average)\nSelect Tools>iMSD>Calculate iMSD (Supplementary Figure S5) and fit and export the iMSD from the memo pad (Supplementary Figure S6).\n5. Calculation of the Diffusion Law from the iMSD\nFit the first few points to extrapolate the intercept (σ02) (5 points are usually enough but more points can be fitted if they show a linear behavior) and compare this value with the previously measured PSF2. If they are comparable, the dynamics of isolated fluorophores are being followed. By contrast, if σ02 >> PSF2 try to acquire faster to ensure that no hidden dynamics are present34.\nCalculate the apparent diffusivity (Dapp) and the average displacement (R) using equations 3 and 4 (see Introduction).\nPlot Dapp as a function of R to obtain a diffusion law comparable with what is measured with spot variation based FCS12 (Figure 3D).\nSubscription Required.
