    "1. SC Extraction\nPrepare 100 mL of extraction buffer (see Table 2) by dissolving EDTA in water. Increase pH with KOH until completely dissolved, then adjust pH to 7.5 with HCl. Add remaining components to the solution, complete to final volume with water, and keep on ice. In a tube, dissolve digitonin in extraction buffer to make a 10% stock solution, vortex thoroughly until completely dissolved, and keep on ice.\n\tNOTE: Extraction buffer can be prepared in advance and kept at 4 °C for 2 months maximum. If wavy bands start to appear at the bottom of the gel, it means extraction buffer is too old. When preparing the 10% digitonin solution, prepare a stock volume counting 500 µL per sample if using mouse liver mitochondria. Digitonin solubility varies upon provenance and product lot (see Table of Materials).\nMitochondria isolated from animal tissue (mouse heart, muscle, liver; rat heart) or cells (human fibroblast) using standard protocols23,24,25 can be used for the extraction of SCs. Once mitochondria are obtained, quantify protein content using the bicinchoninic acid assay kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Supplement isolated mitochondria with proteases and phosphatases inhibitors at this step as needed.\n\tNOTE: SCs can be extracted on either fresh or thawed mitochondria. It is recommended to extract SCs from all samples at the same time, to insure they are treated with the same batches of solutions and under the same conditions.",
    "Based on the mitochondrial protein concentration obtained, and the final digitonin/protein ratio desired, calculate the volume of stock digitonin solution and extraction buffer required as per Table 1. For SC extraction, add 1 µL of extraction buffer (Table 2) containing digitonin for each 10 µg of mitochondrial protein. The digitonin/protein ratio can vary from 2 to 8 g/g. A digitonin titration should always be performed for each new type of sample used (See Figure 2 for an example).\nPellet mitochondria, in a 1.5 mL tube by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nDiscard supernatant and re-suspend the mitochondrial pellet in the calculated volume of ice-cold extraction buffer containing digitonin. Place tubes on a mini tube rotator and incubate for 30 min at 4 °C at a medium rotation speed. Make sure that samples are getting properly mixed.\nCentrifuge samples at 20,400 x g for 45 min at 4 °C to remove insolubilized fragments.\nTransfer supernatant in a new tube on ice and quantify proteins. This fraction represents the respiratory supercomplexes extract. If electrophoresis is not performed on the same day, store samples at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: 1) Avoid freeze/thaw cycles of the extract, as this disrupts higher molecular arrangements of SCs. Aliquot sample before the first freeze/thaw cycle if needed. 2) To perform a standard BN-PAGE experiment, CB should be added to the SCs extract at this step. CB should be added in a 1g/8g ratio relative to the amount of detergent used.\n2. Gradient gel Casting and Electrophoresis\nPrepare 3x gradient buffer and acrylamide stocks for making the gradient gel, aliquot, and store at -20 °C (see Table 3).\nPrepare anode and cathode buffers and keep at 4 °C (see Table 5).",
    "Open the casting chamber and place an outer glass plate (20 cm x 22 cm) in the chamber. Position one set of spacers (1.5 mm) using the alignment card to ensure they are seated firmly against the side and corners of the chamber. Place an inner glass plate (20 cm x 20 cm) on top of the spacers (this forms the gel sandwich), and put a plastic separation sheet on top of the glass plate.\nRepeat step 2.3 until the desired number of gels to cast is reached. For this protocol, 4 gels are casted. The casting chamber system we use (see Table of Materials) allows the casting of a maximum of 10 gels at a time. Take-up the remaining space in the chamber by first adding as many acrylic blocks as needed, and then glass plates if needed.\n\tNOTE: The montage has to be tightly sealed; there should be no space between the gel sandwiches in the chamber.\nPlace a strip of parafilm in the groove before seating the gasket firmly in the gasket notch. Place the sealing plate on the chamber and tighten all 6 screws. Stand the casting chamber.\nPlace gradient former on a stir plate with a magnetic stirrer in the “light” mixing chamber. Connect the tubing of casting chamber to the gradient former, secure the tubing in the cassette of the peristaltic pump, and make sure the stopcock of the gradient former is closed.",
    "To cast 4 gels, prepare 60 mL of 4% and 60 mL of 12% gel solutions (see Table 4) in an Erlenmeyer flask and swirl thoroughly to mix. Pour 60 mL of 4% gel solution in the “light” mixing chamber, and 60 mL of 12% in the “heavy” reservoir chamber of the gradient former. Set stir speed of the stir plate at 350 rpm. Open the stopcock and turn on the pump at 35 rpm.\nOnce the light fraction is lower than the heavy fraction, pause the pump and open the valve stem between “light” and “heavy” reservoirs, let fractions volume equilibrate, and restart the pump.\n\tNOTE: It is important that no bubbles enter the system and get trapped between glass plates. If this happens, undo montage, wash, and redo.\nOnce the gradient gel is completely poured, stop the pump, and overlay water (about 1 mL) on each gel sandwich to prevent drying of the gel. Let polymerize for 2 h.\nPrepare 25 mL stacking gel in Erlenmeyer and swirl to mix thoroughly. Remove water and insert 15 well combs in each gel sandwich. Pour stacking gel and let polymerize for 2 h.\n\tNOTE: Gels can be casted and kept at 4 °C for 1 week.\nInsert gel in sandwich clamps and remove comb. With the short glass plate facing down, insert the gel sandwich in the cooling core. Repeat on the other side, and place core in the electrophoresis tank.\nPour 300 mL of Blue Cathode Buffer in inner chamber of the electrophoresis tank. Pour 2 L of Anode Buffer in outer chamber of electrophoresis tank.\n\tNOTE: The electrode has to be submerged in cathode buffer, which requires approximately 300 mL.",
    "Load between 75 μg and 175 μg of protein per well. Run gel at 150 V for 1.5 h (or until samples have all entered the gradient gel) in cold room (4 °C).\n\tNOTE 1: 1) A minimum of 75 μg per well is required for good resolution of in-gel activity bands. Loading over 175 μg of protein will lead to a loss of clear bands due to excessive enzyme activity. 2) Replicates of the sample should be loaded in separate wells to enable parallel determination of in-gel activities and immunoblot analysis of OXPHOS complexes. Parallel determination of IGA for CI, CII, CIV and CV requires a minimum of 300 µg. Parallel immunoblot analysis of CI, CII, CII, CIV and CV requires a minimum of 375 µg.\nRemove Blue Cathode Buffer with pipet or vacuum, replace by 300 mL Coomassie Blue-free Cathode Buffer, and run gel at 200 V overnight (16–20 h) in cold room (4 °C). Proceed to step 3 or 4 for in-gel activity measurement or immunoblotting.\n3. In-gel Activity for Complexes I, II, IV and CV\nBefore the end of electrophoresis, prepare in-gel activity buffers according to Table 6, and keep in the dark at RT. 20 mL of in-gel activity buffer is sufficient for 3 sample lanes.\n\tNOTE: This CV in-gel activity assay is based on the reverse activity of ATPsynthase (i.e., ATP hydrolysis), and uses calcium as a co-factor, which precipitates in the gel. Calcium is less harmful than the lead used in other protocols. Furthermore, the use of this protocol does not require a pre-activation/conditioning of the gel23.\nStop electrophoresis and retrieve gel. Cut lanes, if necessary, and transfer gel lanes in plastic bags (3 sides cut, and plastic bag opened like a book). Seal 2 of the 3 sides with a heat sealer.",
    "NOTE: To compare the composition of SC bands between experimental groups, it is recommended to run the same samples in replicates on the same gel. Cut lanes to incubate each replicate in different in-gel activity buffers (CI, II, IV, V). To confirm the specificity of the assays, additional replicates can be prepared to run in gel activities in presence of specific respiratory chain inhibitors.\nFor 3 experimental samples (i.e. 3 wells), add 20 mL of in-gel activity buffer, remove bubbles, and seal 4th side of plastic bag.\n\tNOTE: Add inhibitors in negative control experiments if performed: CI: Rotenone 1 µM; CII: Sodium Malonate 10 mM; CIII: Antimycin-A 8 µM; CIV: KCN 0.6 mM; CV: Oligomycin 0.5 µM.\nIncubate gel lanes at 37 °C in the dark and check every 15 min. Incubation time varies depending on the amount of protein and complexes. CI will react faster than CIV or CV. Optimal staining usually occurs after 2 h for CI, 4 h for CIV and 6 h for CII and CV.\nRinse gel lanes in water to stop reaction, and image on a white background for CI, CII, CIV, or black background for CV.\n\tNOTE: Gels can be kept in plastic bags at RT or 4 °C for several months.\n4. Immunoblotting\nPrepare transfer buffer according to Table 7, and keep at RT. Prepare TBST and keep at RT.\nPlace the entire gel, or selected lanes, in a container and add transfer buffer supplemented with SDS (0.25% final in transfer buffer). Place container on rocker and incubate for 1 h.\nCut PVDF membrane (size corresponding to the size of the gel) and activate in 20 mL of methanol under agitation for 2 min. Replace by 20 mL transfer buffer and place under agitation for 2 min.",
    "Prepare transfer sandwich, from bottom to top, making sure there is no bubble between gel and activated PVDF membrane: clear side of cassette / black sponge / blotting paper / membrane / gel / blotting paper / black sponge / black side of cassette. Close and lock the cassette.\nPlace transfer sandwich in transfer tank, with clear side of the sandwich facing the red side of the electrode, and pour transfer buffer to immerge the gel. Connect cooling system to the transfer tank and set at 4 °C. Connect to the power supply, set at 40 mA, and run for 24 h.\nRetrieve membranes, block for 1 h in 5% BSA in TBST, and incubate in primary antibody solution prepared in 5% BSA in TBST overnight at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: See Table 8 for antibodies used.\nRinse membranes in TBST 3x for 10 min each.\nIncubate membranes in secondary antibody solutions prepared in 5% BSA in TBST for 2 h at room temperature.\nRinse membranes in TBST 3x for 10 min each.\nAdd chemiluminescent solution to membranes and image.\n5. Analysis\nIn-gel activity assay images or immunoblots can be used to analyze SCs. To analyze composition of bands, align replicates and validate which complex reacted positively for each given band.\nTo analyze the distribution of complexes, in various supramolecular assemblies, open images in ImageJ and use the Gel analysis tool (see Figure 5 for an example).\n\t\nSelect lanes with the rectangle tool, and plot lanes.\nDraw lines to close the area under the curve of each bands of interest and click on each area with the wand tool to generate a Table containing the area under the curve values.\nTo calculate the distribution of the complex, report the values for each band relative to that of the monomer."
