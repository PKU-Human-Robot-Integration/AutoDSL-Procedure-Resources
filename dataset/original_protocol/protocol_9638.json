    "NOTE: Pay attention to safety measurements before trapping wild-type migratory insects, it is suggested to wear safety gear (gloves, long-sleeved shirts, and goggles). Also, turn off the trap when not in use to avoid other safety hazards and overheating the light. It is important to follow safety protocols before dissection, such as wearing gloves, goggles, and lab coat to prevent exposure to body fluids and chemicals.\n1. Trapping of migrant insects\nBegin this protocol by trapping insects using the searchlight lamp. In this protocol, test insect source is Jiyang district, Jinan city, Shandong province, China (36.977088° N, 116.982747° E).\nUse the main body of the searchlight lamp, that is made of non-rusted steel, the box, which is a rectangular body, and the GT75 type halogen headlamp, with a power of 1000 W. Place the headlamp in the middle as the light source.\nPlace a funnel-shaped insect-collecting channel inside and at the bottom of the light, place a box for insect-collection with a diameter of 5 cm, followed by a 60-order insect-collecting net bag (0.5 m x 0.5 m), which is used to collect insects trapped by light. The known projection of the light is about 500 m above the ground.\nThis protocol emphasizes on the immigratory dynamics of wild-type females and ovary development; therefore, collect different species of insects (here collection was done from April to August, during 2021 to 2022). Avoid collecting small sized and injured insects, select similarly sized large pests for this experiment.\n2. Preparation of insects",
    "Transfer all collected insects from net bag (0.5 m) to the net cage (30 cm x 30 cm), and then provide a Petri dish containing sterilized solution of 10% honey water (feeding is optional). Place the cage at 27 ± 2 °C, 65% ± 12 % relative humidity, and a maintain in dark for 8-12 h.\nSelect wild-type females that have flown inside the cage on the same day, carefully transfer them into the individual vial tubes, and close each tube with a cotton lid. Avoid direct handling, that could damage or injure the pest due to excessive pressure.\n\t​NOTE: All wild-type females were captured in the night-time and dissection was performed in daytime. Thus, each experiment was performed within a day.\n3. Preparation for insect paralyzing method (Figure 1)\nPlace selected female pest individually into a fly vial tube in the middle and anesthetize female using CO2 gas by holding blow gun needle to cause mild paralysis. To confirm whether the pest is paralyzed or not, gently nudge or touch the pest using a soft brush. No response to soft stimuli and immobility indicates a successful paralysis.\n\t​NOTE: Low temperature (-20 °C) can also be used as an alternative technique to paralyze insects.\n4. Dissection of insects\nPlace freshly paralyzed female into the dissecting Petri dish containing absolute ethanol (10 mL). To avoid the influence of scale hairs and powder of wings during dissection, infiltrate the living or paralyzed insect with absolute alcohol and rinse in clean water.\nSeparate the dorsal wings from the junction of the chest and abdomen body, using two pairs of forceps.",
    "Transfer the abdomen into a new disposable Petri dish, containing an appropriate amount of water (2-5 mm deep), and gently peel the abdominal exoskeleton along the dorsal ventral line from the pointed mouth to the tail, using dissecting forceps. Repeat the same steps on the other side, and then put it into clean water to disperse the intact tissues.\nCarefully peel off the epidermis fat tissues using forceps, and gently pull and release the ovaries.\nUse dissecting forceps to gently remove fat particles and other organs around the ovaries. Generally, the pest ovaries are mostly folded inward on both sides of the abdomen, try to operate in a liquid environment while unfolding the ovaries, and slowly peel off the mating sac from the middle, and pick out the fat particles attached to the ovarian tubes.\nGently hold on to the ovary and mating sac from the vertical posterior end and unfold it carefully downwards. To avoid damage during unfolding, transfer the ovary into a new or clean Petri dish containing water. Hold the ovary tip and unfold the ovary inwardly; carefully perform this step to avoid damage of the ovarioles.\n5. Analyzing data for ovarian tissues anatomy\nAt this step assess the eggs development for each insect, following the color and size of the eggs, to judge its maturity. Then, judge the ovarian grade according to egg development.\n\tNOTE: The division of various ovarian development levels is mainly divided, either before egg laying or egg development with yolk precipitation level. Insects egg grain development are further divided into stages for more clarity such as, yolk occurrence stage, yolk maturity stage, and yolk demise stage. The maturity of egg grain depends on the fullness, color, and size of the egg to judge its maturity.",
    "After dissection, ensure to separate the female mating sacs tissues from the intact ovaries, and observe the morphology to distinguish the species because most mating sacs anatomy varies from species to species. Therefore, use mating sacs to distinguish between species.\nAt this step, evaluate the ovarian anatomy, and analyze the ovarian development grading. Divide the ovarian tissues into five grades (grade 1 to grade 5).\n\t\nLook for the following changes and structure to organize the tissue: first grade (1) is an early stage of development (milky transparent), full abdomen, soft, fat body fluffy, light color, difficult to peel. Second grade (2) is the yolk deposition stage and grade the ovaries separately if needed after observing the longer and thicker ovarian canal. Third grade (3) has fewer fat bodies and only a few granules attached to the ovary. Fourth grade (4) appears less elastic and easy to break, and some eggs can be present in the middle of uterine tube. Fifth grade (5) is easy to identify with less or no fat bodies, atrophic and fragile ovaries.\nCapture images using a digital camera as per experimental need.\nSubscription Required.
