  "procedures": [
    "1. Preparation of Micropore Gradients in Macroporous Metallic Implants\nClean the implants (such as implants made of medical grade titanium beads with a size range of 400-500 μm, Neyco SAS, France) with ethanol and then sonicate in acetone for 15 min.\nDesign and manufacture Teflon molds according to the implant size and shape (For standard experiments, cylindrical molds of 1.5 cm diameter with a height of 2 cm are used). Molds should be modular, so that the certain parts can be removed during extraction. Such a mold design ensures the control over the extraction process by forcing the movement of the extraction fluid in a directed manner.\nFor tubular implants designed to replace trachea, the structure should be composed of three pieces: i) a bottom part to determine the size of the implant, ii) a mandrel and iii) an outer core which is removable. This way, the pore size gradient can be formed from outside towards inside.\nPrepare the synthetic polymer (PLLA) solution: For freeze/extraction PLLA solution needs to be prepared in a binary mixture of dioxane and water (87:13%, v:v).\nHeat the mixture to 60 °C in order to obtain a homogenous solution. 60 °C selected as it is the higher limit of the temperature resistance for the precision glass syringes that has to be used for the introduction of the solution into the implants.\nIf high concentration (≥6%), high molecular weight PLLA solutions are used, introduce the solution into the implant after heating immediately. Otherwise gelation of the solution occurs without full immersion.\nCalculate the volume of the necessary polymer solution with respect to the porosity of the implant, for accuracy change in the volume of the frozen solution can be taken into account.",
    "Introduce the solution into the implants with precision glass syringes with 0.1 μl accuracy. The lower limit for the polymer concentration is 3% for reproducible pore gradient formation whereas it becomes hard to obtain homogenous distribution in the thick samples above 6%. However, for specific applications other concentrations can be used.\nFreeze the samples either directly at -80 °C or with a prior incubation period of 30 min at room temperature. Freezing conditions determine partially the pore formation, thus the freezing conditions can be adjusted according to the porosity aimed. Keep the samples overnight at -80 °C.\nExtraction: Immerse the implants in 80% pre-chilled EtOH. Carry out the extraction at -20 °C overnight. To obtain porosity gradients, remove all the mold parts except the mandrel for the tubular implants and all the parts except the bottom part for disk shaped implants. Use a pre-chilled scalpel for easier separation of the mold.\nAfter extraction at -20 °C overnight 19, remove the remaining mold parts and air dry the implants. For characterization of the overall porosity of the structure mercury porosimeter analysis is necessary. Mercury Porosimeter measurements showed distinct peaks that correspond to the pores on the both sides of the implant and the smaller interdispersed pores. However the more crucial data is the difference between the porosities of intraluminal and extraluminal surfaces, which can be analyzed by Image J for pore size distribution with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) 20. For verification of the pore gradient, freeze-fracture the samples and observe the cross-section with SEM.\nDue to the open porous nature of the implants used, and the light reflecting capacity of Titanium, it is possible to do z-stacks of labeled cells within the porous implants. Label the cells with PKH26 or Calcein-AM and visualize the implants with confocal laser microscopy.",
    "2. Surface Coating of Porous Metallic Implants with Collagen/Alginate Multilayers\nFor build-up of multilayers, highest reproducibility is obtained with dipping robots. However, if a dipping robot is not available these steps can be done manually.\nUse medical grade collagen type I and sodium alginate. The optimized concentrations are 0.5 g/L for each in 150 mM NaCl in citrate buffer at pH 3.8.\nDissolve the collagen solution overnight to ensure the homogeneity of the solution. Acidic pH of 3.8 is necessary for stable build-up of the layers as the structure is unstable before crosslinking in neutral pH.\nDeposit the layers by a dipping robot system by immersing the implants into collagen and alginate solutions alternatively. Deposition time is 15 min for each subsequent layer. Rinse the structure in between deposition steps with 150 mM NaCl at pH 3.8 for 5 min.\nDesign specific holder for utilization of the implants with dipping robots used in polyelectrolyte multilayer production. Deposit the layers on the surface of either titanium only implants or implants modified as described in section 1.\nStabilization of the basement membrane mimic with genipin: Prepare the crosslinking solution in a Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)/citrate buffer (150 mM NaCl, pH 3.8) at 1:4 v:v ratio. A wide range of concentrations can be used and 100 mM is adequate for crosslinking. Dissolve genipin first in the DMSO component and add the water component later to avoid clumping.\nCrosslink the samples by the immersion in the crosslinking solution between 12-24 hr. Afterwards rinse with copious amount of citrate buffer (pH 3.8).\nAfter washing steps, sterilize the samples either with UV treatment (30 min) or an antibiotic/antifungal bath (Penicillin/Streptomycin, Fungizone).",
    "The main parameters that determine the quality of the basement membrane mimic are its thickness and the diameter of the fibers. Calculate the fiber diameters using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) images obtained in contact mode. Dry the samples with a nitrogen flow before imaging. Quantify the thickness of at least 10 fibers per image to determine the average fibril thickness with Image J software.\nThe thickness of the films can be determined by scratch tests using AFM. Dry (COL/ALG)24 / COL multilayer films. Use a syringe needle to scratch the film. After localization of the scratch with a light microscope, obtain images with AFM on 10 x 10 μm2 surfaces at the boundary of the scratch. Calculate the heights from the profiles obtained with the AFM software, which provides the thickness of the film layer.\n3. Indirect Monitoring of Implant Integration In vivo by Analysis of Blood Plasma\nAll the necessary committee approvals should be taken for animal experimentation according to the governing rules for each country 21. In our case the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 2010) is followed and the approval of the University of Strasbourg ethic committee is obtained.\nCarry out the implantation at the target site. The blood monitoring protocol given here was used for tracheal replacement in New Zealand white rabbits of a 15 mm tracheal resection.\nFollowing implantation a daily follow-up is necessary such as montioring the general well-being of the animals (healing around the surgical sites, rate of breathing) and recording of their weight.",
    "To validate the blood test, use a well-established method such as ELISA tests for blood CRP levels. CRP tests for many animals are available and the specific test used for rabbits is listed in Table 1. Similarly, use western blotting for the determination of CGA levels. Monoclonal anti-CGA antibodies (anti-CGA47-68) were used in this protocol.\nFor plasma characterization, obtain blood samples from the auricular veins of the rabbits. Centrifuge at 5,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Use the supernatant obtained for analysis. In our procedure, these tests are done on a weekly basis, but more frequent tests are also possible.\nReverse phase HPLC purification of the Plasma protein content: Extract the rabbit plasma with 0.1% of trifluoroacetic acid (1:1; v:v). Purify the extract by using a Dionex HPLC system (Ultimate 3000; Sunnyvale, CA USA) on a nucleosil reverse-phase 300-5C18-column (4 x 250 mm; particle size 5 μm; porosity, 300 Å).\nRecord the absorbance at 214 and 280 nm. The solvent system used is i)Solvent A: 0.1% (v/v) Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water and ii) Solvent B: 0.09% (v/v) TFA in 70% (v/v) acetonitrile-water.\nUse a flow rate of 700 μl/min using gradients for elutions. Collect the peak fractions. Concentrate the fractions by evaporation by speed-vacuum application. It is important to stop the speed-vacuum before complete dryness.\nCorrelate the peaks obtained at different time-points over the course of the implantation period. Use the purified peptides that are showing consistent trends during the course of implantation for identification by automatic Edman sequencing.",
    "Automatic Edman sequencing of the peptides: Determine the N-terminal sequence of the purified peptides by automatic Edman degradation using a Procise microsequencer. Load the sample to polybrene-treated glass-fibre filters. Next step is the identification of Phenylthiohydantoin-amino acids (Pth-Xaa) by chromatography on a C18 column (PTH C-18, 2.1 x 200 mm) 22. After the sequence is obtained, it can be identified by Blast software using SWISS-Prot database.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
