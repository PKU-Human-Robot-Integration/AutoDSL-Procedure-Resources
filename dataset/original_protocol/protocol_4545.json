    "Every experimental step involving the handling of cyanobacterial cell cultures must be performed under a Laminar flow hood to prevent contamination!    Cyanobacterial liquid cultures were inoculated from agar plates in BG11 medium (Rippka et al., 1979) and incubated with continuous shaking (150 rpm) at 30 °C under constant illumination with white light of 50 µmol photons m-2 s-1 measured at the position of the agar plates for 2-3 days (measured with a LI-190R Quantum Sensor).  Note: Even though some mutants carry antibiotic resistance gene cassettes inserted in their genome, cultures for the spot assays were always grown in medium lacking antibiotics to exclude effects from growth on selective media. There is no specific volume or OD needed, but the pre-cultures should not reach late stationary phase and their OD750 should be similar.   The well-grown pre-cultures were diluted to OD750 0.2 in a final volume of 20 ml BG11 medium and were incubated further under the above mentioned conditions until they reached logarithmic phase (approximately OD750 0.6-0.7).  Note: It is important to measure OD at a wavelength where no pigments absorb.   The logarithmically growing cultures were again diluted to OD750 0.2. With the freshly diluted cultures, a dilution series was performed with a multichannel pipette in a sterile microliter plate ranging from 100 to 10-7 (Figure 1).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150905/20150905203140_2242.jpg Figure 1. Dilution series for viability analysis. Rows B to H were pre-filled with 180 µl BG11 medium. After every dilution step, the cell suspension was thoroughly mixed with the pipette before transferring part of it into the next well.      From each of the dilution steps, 5 µl was spotted in triplicates using the multichannel pipette onto square BG11 agar plates supplemented with 0.3% (w/v) Na2S2O3. Note: The exact composition of the agar can be customized.",
    "If the experimenter wishes to observe viability under mixotrophic conditions, the BG11 agar can be i.e. supplemented with glucose. It is also possible to exclude iron or nitrogen from the media stock solutions. However do not forget to add Na2S2O3 to the plates. This is important for proper growth of the colonies (Thiel et al., 1989).    The drops of liquid cultures were allowed to dry for approximately 15-20 min (closed plate, at room temperature on the table top). Afterwards, plates were incubated at 30 °C under constant illumination with white light at 50 µmol photons m-2 s-1 for approximately 5 days or until no more colonies appeared in the highest dilution step. Note: To prevent phototactic movement of motile strains, the plates should be placed below the light source and lateral illumination from only one side should be avoided. In order to prevent dripping (in case the drops are not completely dry), the plates were incubated with the lid facing upwards for the first day. After the first day, plates were turned upside down to avoid evaporated water dripping on the spots. For investigation of light-dark related phenotypes, constant illumination can also be changed to light-dark-cycles. In our case, we investigated mutants of circadian clock associated genes and therefore chose a 12:12 h light:dark incubation. In this case, the starting OD750 for the dilution series was adjusted to 0.4 instead of 0.2 (step 2).   Record the result (Figure 2) by scanning the plate or by taking a picture. In the best case, it may even be possible to count the single colonies within several spots (you may need a Binocular microscope).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150905/20150905203304_1367.jpg Figure 2.

    "The plate was incubated until no more colonies appeared in the highest dilution step. Strains have been published by Dörrich et al. (2014).  Further results generated by using this method were published by Dörrich et al. (2014)."
