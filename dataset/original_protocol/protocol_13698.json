  "procedures": [
    "The experiments presented here are performed using about 10-week-old female domestic pigs and are approved by the Animal Experiment Board in Finland. Animals weigh 30-40 kg at the beginning of the protocol, allowing the same procedural equipment and imaging modalities as possible for humans. Chronic ischemia is induced 14 days before the gene transfer, and the follow-up time after the gene transfer depends on the viral vector used. The study protocol is shown in Figure 1. This protocol can be used to perform adenoviral or AAV-mediated gene therapy injections. The time of sample collection has to be adjusted to the transgene expression peak, which depends on the viral vector used. For example, when performing adenoviral gene transfers, the time of the sample collection is set to 6 days after the gene transfer.\n1. Medication\nAdminister a daily dose of 200 mg of amiodarone and 2.5 mg of bisoprolol to prevent fatal ventricular arrhythmias. The medication begins 1 week before the ischemia operation and is continued daily until the follow-up.\nIn addition, administer peroral doses of clopidogrel (300 mg) and acetylsalicylic acid (300 mg) to the animals 1 day before the ischemia operation to prevent acute in-stent thrombosis after the stent placement.\nAdminister 100 mg of lidocaine and 2.5 mL of (246 mg/mL) MgSO4 intravenously to the animals at the beginning of the ischemia operation to prevent ventricular arrhythmias.\nAdminister intramuscular injection of cefuroxime (500 mg) at the beginning of each operation for infection prophylaxis.\nAdminister 30 mg of enoxaparin intravenously at the beginning of the ischemia operations and subcutaneously after the operation procedure for thrombosis prevention.",
    "For anesthesia and analgesia, administer 1.5 mL of atropin, 6 mL of azaperone (40 mg/mL), propofol 20 mg/mL, at a rate of 15 mg/kg/h, and fentanyl 50 µg/mL at a rate of 10 µg/kg/h. Drug dosages were the same for each pig. Refer to local animal use guidelines for dose administration.\nAnesthetize the animals during all operations. All the operations should be performed in a sterile environment using a sterile technique.\n2. Transthoracic echocardiography\nPerform transthoracic echocardiography before ischemia operation, gene transfer, and euthanasia to evaluate any detectable pericardial fluid and determine the myocardial strain.\nPlace the transducer in the third or fourth intercostal space under the armpit of the pig to access parasternal short-axis views at the mitral valve level, papillary muscle, and apical levels (Video 1). The marker of the transducer should point to the sternum of the pig. To save a clip, press Acquire.\n3. Endovascular operations under fluoroscopic guidance\nPerform left ventricle cine imaging after coronary angiograms before ischemia operation, gene transfer and tissue collection.\nPreparation of the operation\nPrepare for the operations by sedating the pigs with an intramuscular injection of 1.5 mL of atropine and 6 mL of azaperone.\nAfter the sedation, induce general propofol and fentanyl anesthesia for the angiographic procedures to the pigs with doses of 15 mg/kg/h and 10 µg/kg/h, respectively.\n\t\tNOTE: The pigs are anesthetized for the entire procedure.\nSupport the ventilation by intubation and ventilator and monitor the vital physiological parameters, such as ECG and respiratory parameters.\nIntroducer sheath placement\nPlace an introducer sheath into the right femoral artery for all the operations as standard practice in cardiology. Use ultrasound to track the femoral artery and pierce it with an entry needle (18 G).",
    "NOTE: Use an 8F introducer sheath for intramyocardial gene transfers and a 6F sheath for all other operations. Introduce the guidewire of the sheath through the needle to thread the artery and hold the guidewire still while removing the needle.\nInsert the introducer sheath along the guidewire, and when placed, remove the guidewire and administer 1.25 mg of sublingual dinitrate to the pig to induce coronary vasodilation.\nCoronary angiography\nPerform coronary angiography directly before ischemia operation, gene transfer, and tissue collection. The machinery needed for the angiograms is shown in Figure 2.\nUse a 6F catheter under fluoroscopic guidance with an iodine contrast agent to image the right coronary artery and the left ascending coronary artery (Video 2).\nLeft ventricle cine imaging under rest and dobutamine stress\nAdminister a 21 mL bolus of iodine contrast agent into the left ventricle via a 5F pigtail catheter using an auto-injector. First, set the bolus duration at 3 s and the total volume for 21 mL. Then, press Single and Yes.\nCalculate the ejection fraction by the measurement software of the angiographic workstation. To perform the calculation, select Ventricular Analysis of the image in question. Scroll the image to select a time frame, one in diastole and one in systole. Select a tool to draw ventricular outlines of each time frame.\n\t\tNOTE: The software now calculates the ejection fraction and stroke volume by the Simpson's method. The ejection fraction measurement is performed during rest and under dobutamine-induced stress.\nStress imaging\nDose dobutamine intravenously in escalating doses from 10 µg/kg/min to 20 µg/kg/min for the dobutamine-induced stress imaging until the target heart rate of 160 bpm is reached. Then, perform the cine imaging.\nIschemia operation",
    "Place a bottleneck stent into the left coronary artery (LAD) 14 days before the gene transfer to induce chronic myocardial ischemia. After the bottleneck stent placement, check whether the bottleneck stent is placed correctly, restricting the coronary blood flow.\n\t\tNOTE: The bottleneck stent is placed on a dilation catheter and consists of a bare-metal stent covered by a polytetrafluoroethylene tube formed in a bottleneck shape to reduce coronary blood flow9.\nDefining the stent size\nChoose the size of the stent, either 3.0/3.5/4.0 x 8 mm, according to the size of the left ascending coronary artery in the angiogram by using the automatic measurement software in the angiographic workstation (Video 3)12.\nStent placement\nPlace a coil to the left coronary artery and glide the bottleneck stent to the LAD, placing it distally to the first diagonal.\nInflate the stent to nominal pressure in the artery using an in-deflator with a stent-to-lumen ratio of 1.3, anchoring the bottleneck in place. After an additional 15 s, deflate the stent and retract the equipment from the artery.\n\t\tNOTE: Confirm the correct placement of the bottleneck stent by angiogram.\n4. PET imaging\nNOTE: One day before the gene transfer, perform rest and stress 15O-labeled radiowater PET/CT scans (requires hospital environment and radiological technicians).\nReference imaging\nPerform computed tomography (CT) scans before rest and stress imaging. Use the CT information for attenuation correction.\n15O-labeled radiowater imaging\nPerform rest and stress imaging using an 800 MBq 15H2O bolus.\nStress imaging\nPerform stress imaging with a further 800 MBq 15O-water bolus after a suitable radioactive decay of 12 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Hyperemia is induced by adenosine (200 µg/kg/min intravenous), as described previously12.\n5. Gene transfer\nElectroanatomical mapping\nProceed to electroanatomical mapping after a coronary angiogram and functional measurements (echocardiography, LV cine imaging).",
    "Introduce a mapping catheter to the left ventricle via femoral sheath in fluoroscopic guidance.\n\t\tNOTE: Register about 100-150 points around the left ventricle with the mapping catheter to create the electroanatomical map.\nFinishing the electroanatomical map\nDelete the outlier points to ensure a more reliable electroanatomical map of the left ventricle.\nDo this by selecting Clip Planes of the map and delete the points that differ from the points forming the ventricular shape. Next, select Trajectories for the map view and delete the points that have traveled horizontally during point registering.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure the remaining points cover the left ventricle and register more points if needed.\nGene transfer injections\nIntroduce an intramyocardial injection catheter to the left ventricle via the femoral sheath under fluoroscopic guidance. Set the injection needle length to 3 mm.\nCriteria for intramyocardial injections\nGuide the gene transfers by electroanatomical mapping system and target the injections into viable but hypokinetic areas of the left ventricle.\n\t\tNOTE: For viability, use a unipolar voltage over 5 mV as a criterion. For hypokinesia, select a local linear shortening (LLS) as low as available, at least below 12% but preferably below 6%13.\nIntramyocardial injections\nDuring 30 s, inject the vector material into the point of selection (step 5.4) and keep the injection needle inside the myocardium for an additional 5 s before retracting to prevent backflow to the left ventricle.\n6. Euthanasia and sample collection\nNOTE: After the coronary angiogram and ejection fraction measurements described in steps 3.4.1 and 3.5.2, respectively, administer 50 mL of saturated potassium chloride intravenously to the anesthetized pig.\nPerfusion fixation of the heart",
    "Harvest the heart from the thoracic cavity. Rinse with water. Place an 18 G needle above the aortic valve and attach the needle to a perfusion pump. Perfuse the heart with 750 mL of 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA).\nSample collection\nSlice the heart into 1 cm thick slices using a sharp kitchen knife. Collect the samples from the gene transfer area into 4% PFA and liquid nitrogen.\n\t\tNOTE: To harvest negative controls, collect a control sample from the posterior wall of the left ventricle.\nSafety tissue collection\nHarvest samples from remote tissues, such as the lung, liver, kidney, spleen, and ovaries. Take samples into 4% PFA and liquid nitrogen.\n7. Sample storing\nStore the samples for staining in 4% PFA for 48 h at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: Replace the PFA daily with a fresh liquid.\n\t\nAfter 48 h, replace the PFA with 15% sucrose in deionized water. Store for at least 24 h before embedding the samples into paraffin blocks. Snap frozen samples are stored at -70 °C.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
