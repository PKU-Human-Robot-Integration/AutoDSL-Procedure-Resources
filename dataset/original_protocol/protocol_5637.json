    "Bacterial cultureMycobacterium tuberculosis strains are grown at 37 °C in 7H9 OADC media (see Recipes) in standing culture in T25 flasks until mid-log phase (OD600 ~0.6). Bacterial cultures are started from frozen stocks and maintained for no more than 5 passages. Constitutive expression of fluorescent protein by Mtb is required for further detection. We used Mtb Erdman strains with an integrated pMV306 plasmid expressing mCherry from smyc promoter (smyc’::mCherry). This plasmid confers kanamycin resistance, therefore growth media contains kanamycin at a final concentration of 25 μg/ml (see Recipes).Notes: Do not grow more than 10 ml of bacterial culture in a T25 flask to ensure sufficient amount of oxygen available to Mtb. To estimate timing for bacterial culture growth, consider that Mtb divides approximately once in two days when grown in standing culture. More details on bacterial culture growth for macrophage infection can be found in (Nazarova and Russell, 2017).We advise testing your wild type strain constitutively expressing fluorescent protein for ability to efficiently intake Bodipy-palmitate during macrophage infection by microscopy. We have noticed that in Mtb Erdman strain expression of mCherry under strong promoter (smyc’ or hsp60’) from replicating plasmid impacts Bodipy-palmitate uptake. However CDC1551 strain with the same plasmid demonstrated high level of fatty acid uptake. Additionally, care should be taken to determine by confocal microscopy if Bodipy-palmitate accumulates within bacteria versus on their surface.Macrophage isolation and culturingMacrophages of various origins can be used. We differentiated macrophages from bone marrow cells from BALB/c mice and maintained in BMDM media (see Recipes) with antibiotics at 37 °C and 6.0% CO2 for 10 days before infection. Infection The day before infection seed macrophages in antibiotic-free BMDM media into T150 tissue culture flasks (3 x 107 cells and 40-50 ml of BMDM media per flask) to obtain confluent monolayers.",
    "If macrophages are of limited numbers one T75 flask with 1 x 107 cells would provide sufficient results, however, two T150 flasks (6 x 107 cells) would give easily detectable pellet of bacteria at the end of the experiment.On the day of infection measure optical density of mid-log Mtb culture. Assuming that OD600 of 0.6 equals 108 bacteria/ml, centrifuge required amount of culture at 3,300 rpm (~2,500 x g) for 12 min in Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge, GH-3.8 rotor. We infect macrophages at MOI of 4:1, therefore to infect 6 x 107 cells we need 2.4 x 108 bacteria. To ensure that sufficient numbers of bacteria are pelleted we routinely centrifuge 3 ml of bacteria at OD600 = 0.6.Notes: As estimation of bacterial numbers may vary, one may want to determine it on their own. However, to achieve higher replicability in terms of MOI, we advise adhering to our estimation. More details on macrophage infection can be found in (Nazarova and Russell, 2017).Following centrifugation, remove the supernatant and resuspend the bacterial pellet in 1.5 ml of BUB (see Recipes). Pass bacterial suspension through a 1 ml tuberculin syringe with 25 gauge needle 12-20 times the same syringe and needle. Add 3.5 ml of BUB to the suspension to obtain 5 ml in total and mix thoroughly.Add 2.4 ml of bacterial suspension to each T150 flask containing 3 x 107 cells. Mix well, but gently. Incubate at 37 °C and 6% CO2 for 4 h.Remove extracellular bacteria by replacing with fresh pre-warmed antibiotic free BMDM media. Infected macrophages are maintained in BMDM medium at 37 °C and 6% CO2 for 3 days. Changing media on the second day of infection is optional.",
    "Labeling On the day of labeling (third day of infection) pre-warm sterile 1% fatty acid-free BSA (see Recipes) in PBS at 37 °C for 30-60 min. Add 4 mM stock of Bodipy-palmitate (see Recipes) to obtain 100 μM concentration. For labeling one T75 flask add 50 μl of 4 mM Bodipy-palmitate stock to 1.95 ml of 1% fatty acid-free BSA. Mix well by vortexing until the solution turns green. Keep at 37 °C and protect from light.Notes: The day of labeling can be chosen with consideration of the questions you are trying to address. We tested uptake of Bodipy-palmitate at various stages of macrophage infection, and noted that before the third day of infection the uptake levels are not sufficient to be detected.In addition to Bodipy-palmitate, we have tested Bodipy FL C12 and Bodipy 558/568 C12. Bodipy FL C12 accumulated in intracellular bacteria as efficiently as Bodipy-palmitate, while Bodipy 558/568 C12 was poorly assimilated by Mtb. We chose to use Bodipy-palmitate as fatty acids of the length (16 carbons) are more commonly found in the membranes of macrophages infected with Mtb.For labeling one T75 flask add 1.6 ml of 100 μM Bodipy-palmitate in 1% fatty acid-free BSA (from Step 1 of Labeling) to 18.4 ml of pre-warmed cuvette buffer (see Recipes) such that the final concentration of the labeled lipid is 8 μM, mix well. Use 15 ml for labeling one T75 flask, and 30 ml for labeling one T150 flask. Increase volumes in Steps 1 and 2 (Labeling) accordingly for larger infections.Remove media from infected macrophages and replace with cuvette buffer containing Bodipy-palmitate (volumes are described in Step 2 of Labeling). Incubate the infected macrophages with label at 37 °C and 6.0% CO2 for 1 h.",
    "After the 1 h labeling period, remove the cuvette buffer containing the Bodipy-palmitate and add fresh pre-warmed cuvette buffer without label for 1 h. Use 15 ml for one T75 flask, and 30 ml for one T150 flask. Proceed to the next step right after 1 h incubation without label.Note: Alternatively, Bodipy-palmitate in 1% fatty acid-free BSA can be added directly to infected macrophages cultured in BMDM media. Label chase can be performed in fresh pre-warmed BMDM medium as well. No cuvette buffer is needed in this case. From our experience, either way of labeling gives comparable results. Isolation of intracellular bacteriaNote: This portion of the protocol is based on phagosome isolation described in (Pethe et al., 2004). Remove cuvette buffer from labeled infected cells, and quickly rinse with 10 ml of Homogenization buffer (see Recipes).Add 15 ml of ice-cold Homogenization buffer, incubate at 4 °C for 10-15 min, and harvest macrophages by scraping off from each flask with cell scrapers. Transfer the cells to a 50 ml conical tube and pellet the cells by centrifugation at 1,500 rpm (514 x g) for 10 min in Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge, GH-3.8 rotor. This and all the following centrifugations are done at 4 °C to block any further uptake of lipids by bacteria.Remove supernatant, resuspend pellet in 1.5 ml of Homogenization buffer by pipetting and transfer the cells to a 15 ml conical tube. Lyse the cells by 25-70 passages through a 1 ml tuberculin syringe with 25 gauge needle. Monitor cell lysis under a microscope using glasstic slides with 100 grids. Continue until > 95% of the cells are lysed, when intact cells are replaced by cell debris.Note: For safety purposes place glass slide with infected material in 150 x 15 mm Petri dish.",
    "Increase the volume to 5 ml by adding Homogenization buffer, resuspend well. Centrifuge cell lysate at 800 rpm (~146 x g) for 10 min in Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge, GH-3.8 rotor.Transfer the supernatant (suspension of phagosomes) into a new 15 ml conical tube. The pellet mainly consists of nuclei and unlysed cells and is discarded.To the suspension add 20% Tween 80 (see Recipes) to a final concentration of 0.1%, mix well and leave at 4 °C for 15 min to lyse Mtb containing vacuoles.Quickly agitate by shaking and isolate the bacteria by centrifugation at 2,500 rpm (1,430 x g) for 15 min in Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge, GH-3.8 rotor.Remove supernatant and resuspend the bacterial pellet in 10 ml of 0.05% tyloxapol in PBS (see Recipes). Centrifuge bacteria down at 3,300 rpm (~2,500 x g) for 15 min in Beckman Allegra 6KR centrifuge, GH-3.8 rotor.Optional: repeat the previous step to further remove labeled fatty acids adhered to bacterial cell surface.Note: Non-specific binding of bodipy-palmitate to the bacterial cell surface produces background signal. However, if tested strains/conditions produce a significant difference in specific uptake of label, this background noise wouldn’t impact results greatly.Remove supernatant and fix bacteria in 4% PFA (see Recipes) for 24 h in 2 ml screw-cap tube.Note: If you have flow cytometer in BSL3 facility, bacteria can be analyzed live immediately after isolation and without fixation."
