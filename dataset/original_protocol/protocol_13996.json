  "procedures": [
    "The procedure described below has been approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi. The serial reference number of the approval is IAEC#355/14.\n1. Preparation\nPrepare for the surgical procedure as described earlier by Das B et al.26.\nUse 6–8-week-old inbred Wistar rats with a body weight of 200–250 g.\nHouse the animals under standard animal care conditions and feed them with rat chow and libitum before and after the procedure.\nWhen performing 70% PHx, use a standard cocktail mix of ketamine hydrochloride (100 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (10 mg/kg body weight), which is injected intraperitoneally.\n\tNOTE: The type of anesthetic used can have postoperative effects on the mortality and morbidity.\nDuring the cell transplant, use inhalant anesthesia Isoflurane (2-chloro-2-(difluoromethoxy)-1,1,1-trifluoro-ethane) to reduce the time of recovery of the animal after the transplantation surgery.\nInduce and maintain the inhalational anesthesia using a customized anesthesia system. Maintain the oxygen flow at 4 L/min. For induction use isoflurane at 4% and for maintenance use 2–3% during the surgical procedure.\n2. Preoperative procedures\nAnesthetize the rat by injecting the ketamine-xylazine mixture described in step 3.1 intraperitoneally. Confirm the complete anesthetization by pinching the toe of the animal. Further procedures are carried out only when there is no pedal reflex.\nTo prevent corneal desiccation, apply a carboxy methyl-cellulose based eye drop to both eyes.\nRestrain the anesthetized animal to a surgical board using white tape. Place the animal with the abdominal side facing up, ensuring the mouth is on the distal side from the person performing the operation.\nRemove hair from the upper right abdominal surgical area using an electric clipper.\nDisinfect the surgical site by three alternating scrubs of povidone iodine and 70% ethanol using sterilized cotton pads in circular motion.",
    "3. Partial hepatectomy (PHx) to remove 70% of the mass of the liver\nNOTE: Perform the entire surgical procedure under a sterile environment in a laminar flow hood. Use only sterile surgical instruments to minimize the risk of infection postsurgically. Removal of 70% of the liver mass, named 70% partial hepatectomy (70% PHx), was performed as described by C. Mitchell and H. Willenbring, 200827.\nPrior to the start of the surgery, confirm the complete anesthetization of the animal by pinching its toe. Further procedures are carried out only when there is no pedal reflex.\nMark the skin to be cut just beneath the sternum, perpendicular to the xiphoid, and parallel to the ribcage.\nPlace a sterile drape sheet having an opening of around 3 cm x 1 cm over the marked skin.\nPerform a transverse incision of around 2–3 cm along the marked line with a scalpel. Use surgical blade No. 22. Gently remove the attachment of the skin to the underlying muscle layer in the vicinity of the incised area using sterile moistened cotton tips.\nNext, make a transverse incision through the peritoneal layer just beneath the xiphoid process.\nWith the help of two saline moistened cotton tips, expose the left lobe of the liver by applying gentle pressure on the thorax. Place one cotton tip on the diaphragmatic region of the incised portion and the other cotton tip below the incised region to lift the liver lobe up.\nSlip an 8–10 cm long sterile nylon thread loop (size 4–0, 0.15 mm diameter) around the exposed liver lobe. Take the loop to the base of the lobe close to the hilum with the help of microdissecting forceps or moistened cotton buds.",
    "With the help of the microsurgery needle holder and microforceps, tie the two ends of the loop, placing the knot as close to the base of the lobe as possible to constrict the blood vessel and reduce bleeding after the liver lobe is removed. Tie two additional knots on the other side.\nTake precaution not to tie the knot too close to the nearby blood vessels, which may otherwise cause venous obstruction (stenosis).\nUse microsurgery scissors to cut the tied lobe just above the knot, which leaves a discolored mass of tissue called an ischemic stump in place of the lobe.\n\tNOTE: The rat liver, like those of mice, is divided into four distinct lobes: the median lobe, right lateral lobe, left lateral lobe, and caudate lobe, which represent about 40%, 20%, 30%, and 7% of the total liver mass, respectively. Any combination of these lobes can be removed to excise 70% liver mass. In the current study, the median lobe and left lateral lobes were removed.\nCarefully locate the median lobe without damaging the remaining stump of left lateral lobe. Gently pull it out of the abdominal cavity, and at the base of the lobe tie an 8–10 cm long nylon thread (size 4–0) knot as mentioned earlier. Tie two additional knots on the other side. Carefully excise and remove the tied median lobe taking all the precautions mentioned.\nAfter removing the lobes, suture the peritoneum using an absorbable chromic 4–0 suture with continuous stitches followed by skin suturing with an interrupted suture.\nApply povidone iodine on the skin surrounding the sutures to prevent infection.\nRemove the drape sheet and remove the animal from the surgery board.\n4. Postoperative care in animals",
    "Intraperitoneally inject the animal with a dose of 12 mg cefotaxime antibiotic in 1 mL of 5% glucose solution with a 1 mL syringe to protect it from the risk of postoperative infection.\nAdminister a subcutaneous injection of analgesic meloxicam (1 mg/kg body weight) for pain relief after surgery and follow it up by two more doses, keeping the regimen as one dose per day.\nHouse the operated animals under standard conditions of 12 h light/dark cycle and monitor at regular intervals.\n5. Injection of drug in partially hepatectomized animals to induce liver failure\nAfter 24 h postsurgery, when the animals have successfully recovered from 70% PHx, measure the body weight of the animal followed by the injections.\nInject 750 mg/kg body weight of APAP intraperitoneally in partially hepatectomized animals 24 h after the 70% PHx following the animals' successful recovery from the surgical procedure. Repeat the dose again after 24 h.\n\tNOTE: Two doses of APAP are administered intraperitoneally to the animal (i.e., 24 h and 48 h post the 70% PHx procedure, respectively).\nAt each time point after the injection of APAP, measure the body weight of the recovering animal.\n\tNOTE: APAP (biocetamol) is injected in animals as a 150 mg/mL solution in 2% benzyl alcohol.\n6. Transplantation of healthy hepatocytes in ALF animal models",
    "NOTE: To study the reversibility of ALF in rats, transplant healthy syngeneic rat hepatocytes intrasplenically in the ALF-induced animals along with the 1st dose of APAP. In the current study, to provide ample time to the transplanted cells for homing and engraftment, the transplantation was done just after giving the 1st dose of APAP. Rat hepatocytes are isolated by a protocol first published by Berry and Friends et al.28 and later adapted in various other studies29,30,31 with some modifications. For intrasplenic transplantation of cells in the ALF animal model, follow the steps mentioned below.\nPlace the rat into a poly (methyl methacrylate) chamber for induction of anesthesia with 4% isoflurane and 4 L/min oxygen flow for a rat of 250–350 g body weight. Check for the depth of anesthesia by the lack of pedal reflexes when pinching the toe of the animal.\nPlace the anaesthetized rat on the surgical board such that its left lateral portion is facing up. Maintain anesthesia at 2–3% isoflurane inhalation through a suitable mouthpiece.\nShave the skin on the left lateral region and sterilize it by povidone iodine solution.\nMake a transverse incision on the shaved region of skin.\nMake a 1–2 cm cut in the peritoneal layer to expose the spleen.\nGently take out the spleen of the peritoneal cavity and lift it up with the help of two moistened cotton tips.\nKeep the cells (typically 107 per animal) to be transplanted suspended in 50 µL IMDM media in a 1 mL insulin syringe with a 29 G needle.\nGently pierce the needle into the spleen cortex and release the cell suspension into the spleen within 2–3 min.",
    "After the cell transplantation is completed, carefully take out the needle and dab the area of the needle puncture with a moistened cotton tip to avoid leakage of the cell suspension from the site.\nClose the peritoneum and skin by a 4–0 absorbable suture with continuous and discontinuous suturing respectively.\nApply povidone iodine solution on the skin at the place of the sutures to prevent infection on the operated site.\nIntraperitoneally inject 1 mL volume of 12 mg/mL of antibiotic (e.g., cefotaxime) solution and subcutaneously inject analgesic (e.g., meloxicam) 1 mg/kg body weight to the animal as a part of postoperative care. Move the animal to a warm recovering cage.\nKeep the operated animal in isolation under normal conditions of 12 h light/dark cycle until the surgical wounds are completely healed. This may take 3–4 days.\n7. Characterization of ALF development\nEuthanize the animals by overdose of ketamine-xylazine solution 2 h after the 2nd dose of APAP treatment and collect blood and tissue samples.\nCollect serum from blood for biochemical studies32.\nProcess liver tissue samples for histological and gene expression studies33,34,35.\nSubscription Required.
