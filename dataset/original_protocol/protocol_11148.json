    "All mouse experiments were performed in compliance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the Third Military Medical University. Use 6-8-week-old C57BL/6 mice and naïve OT-I transgenic mice weighing 18-22 g. Use both male and female without randomization or \"blinding.\"\n1. Preparation of medium and reagents\nPrepare cell culture medium D10 as previously described29 by adding 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 2 mM L-glutamine into Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium.\nPrepare cell culture medium R10 by supplementing RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.\n\tNOTE: The culture media, D10 and R10, can remain sterile and stable for at least 2 weeks when stored at 2-4 °C.\nPrepare Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) buffer by supplementing 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 2% FBS and 0.01% of sodium azide.\n\tNOTE: With the addition of sodium azide, FACS Buffer can be stored at 2-4 °C for months.\nPrepare red blood cell lysis (RBL) buffer by adding 155 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, and 0.1 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) into double-distilled water, and adjust its pH to 7.3.\n\tNOTE: RBL buffer is stable for up to 3 months at room temperature (RT).\nPrepare magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) buffer by supplementing PBS with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2 mM EDTA.\n\tNOTE: The solution should be passed through a 0.22 µm filter after the reagent is dissolved and preserved in asepsis.\nPrepare a working solution of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol.\n\t\nDissolve 2.5 g of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol in 5 mL of tert-amyl alcohol (2-methyl-2-butanol). Stir in a vapor-bathing, constant-temperature vibrator at 180 rpm, 40 °C overnight.",
    "Filter the solution through a 0.22 µm filter into a sterile container. Add double-distilled water up to a final volume of 200 mL, and mix thoroughly and continuously until the solution becomes clear and transparent.\nDetermine and adjust the pH value of the solution to 7.3. Completely wrap the container with aluminum foil to exclude light and store at 4 °C.\n\t\t​NOTE: The final concentration of the working solution of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol is 12.5 mg/mL. A more concentrated solution is not recommended because the material is irritating at higher concentrations. Test the pH value of the working solution before each use, and discard it if the pH is less than 5.\n2. Preparation of B16F10-OVA cell suspension\nNOTE: Cell culture should be carried out in a biosafety hood under strict aseptic conditions.\nThaw and culture a vial of B16F10-OVA cells with D10 in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nWhen the cells reach the confluency of about 80-90%, subculture the cells.\n\t\nRemove the culture medium with a pipettor, and rinse the cells twice using PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not add PBS forcefully against the adherent cells in the flask or cell culture dish. Instead, pipette the PBS toward a sidewall or add it drop-wise into the flask or dish.\nRemove the PBS, and add 1-2 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution into the flask or dish. Rock it back and forth to cover the entire cell surface. Place the flask or dish in an incubator at 37 °C for ~1 min or at RT until the cells detach.\n\t\t​NOTE: An inverted microscope can be used to check whether the cells have detached.\nAdd fresh D10 to stop the trypsinization. Pipette the suspension up and down to ensure that all the cells are dissociated from the flask or dish surface.",
    "Transfer the B16F10-OVA cell suspension into a 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge the cells at 125 × g for 5-7 min at RT.\nDiscard the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet with D10. Dispense the B16F10-OVA cell suspension into a new flask or cell culture dish containing D10 and incubate in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nOn the day of the tumor implantation, harvest B16F10-OVA cells that are ~90% confluent as described in steps 2.2.1 to 2.2.4. Discard the supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL of PBS.\nCount the viable cells with a hemocytometer using 0.4% trypan blue. Adjust the cell density to 1 × 106 cells per 100 µL by adding PBS. Keep the cells on ice.\n3. Ectopic tumor implantation of B16F10-OVA cells in the inguinal region of mice\nUse 6-8-week-old C57BL/6 mice weighing 18-22 g. Use both male and female without randomization or \"blinding.\"\nWithdraw 100 µL of the prepared B16F10-OVA cell suspension into a 1 mL tuberculin syringe. Tap the barrel to move bubbles to the top, and gently push the plunger to remove air bubbles.\nRestrain the mouse and expose its abdomen. Press the left hind leg with the little finger to tighten the skin of the left inguinal region.\nRemove the mouse's hair from its left lower abdomen with an electric shaver. Use cotton soaked in 75% ethanol to clean the posterior quadrant of the left abdomen.\nHolding the syringe at a very shallow angle (0-15°) with the bevel of the needle facing upwards, insert it at the site of the left upper thigh, and advance 0.5-1 cm through the subcutaneous tissue into the inguinal region.",
    "Pull back on the plunger prior to injection. If there is negative pressure, depress the plunger entirely, and observe a small bolus (formation of fluid pocket) in the subcutis emerge.\n\tNOTE: If blood is drawn back into the needle hub, withdraw and try again at another site.\nRemove the needle after the injection is carried out and dispose of it appropriately. Release and place the mouse back into the cage.\nMeasure tumor size on days 6-8 using a vernier scale after B16F10-OVA implantation. Select mice with a ~3 mm diameter (mung bean-sized) tumor and divide them equally and randomly into two groups.\n\t​NOTE: Mice with tumors of similar size are randomly assigned as donor and recipient mice; the matched tumor tissue excised from donor mice will be transplanted into the recipient mice. Furthermore, non-operated controls and sham-operated controls should be included to evaluate the effects of surgery on adoptive cell transfer and on the general health of mice. Thus, one group of tumor-bearing mice serves as non-operated controls, receiving either CD45.1+CD45.2+ or CD45.1+ OT-I cells but no surgery. The other group of mice serves as sham-operated controls, receiving either CD45.1+CD45.2+ or CD45.1+ OT-I cells and subsequent surgery similar to the experimental group but no allograft transplantation.\n4. Adoptive transfer of congenically marked OT-I T cells into tumor-bearing mice\nOn the day before the transfer, administer 4 mg of cyclophosphamide dissolved in 200 µL of PBS via intraperitoneal injection to each tumor-bearing mouse.\n\tNOTE: Treatment with cyclophosphamide aims to induce lymphopenia in the host that produces \"space\" for transferred cells, promoting their survival and homing to lymphoid organs to function efficiently.",
    "Use naïve OT-I transgenic mice with distinct congenic markers (6-8-week-old, 18-22 g, the same sex as the tumor-bearing mice). Use CD45.1+ OT-I mice and CD45.1+CD45.2+ OT-I mice to adoptively transfer OVA257-264 antigen-specific T cells into tumor-bearing donor and recipient mice, respectively.\n\tNOTE: The origin of adoptively transferred OT-I cells can be easily identified if they display distinct congenic or fluorescent markers. For instance, inject CD45.1+ OT-I T cells into B16F10-OVA-bearing donor mice while injecting CD45.1+CD45.2+ OT-I T cells into B16F10-OVA-bearing recipient mice. CD45.1 and CD45.2 are both isoforms of the pan-lymphocyte marker CD45 (Ly5). Other commonly used congenic markers include different isoforms of CD90 (Thy1). This protocol can be used for mice carrying different congenic markers. OT-I mice should be of the same sex as the mice receiving OT-I cell transfer to avoid rejection issues.\nIsolate the lymphocytes from the spleen and lymph nodes of the OT-I mouse.\n\tNOTE: The following procedures in this step must be performed in a biosafety cabinet to maintain strict asepsis.\n\t\nPrepare two 60 mm × 10 mm Petri dishes. Add 3 mL of R10 medium into one dish while adding 3 mL of RBL buffer into another dish. Place a 70 µm nylon cell strainer in the dish containing RBL buffer.\nEuthanize an OT-I mouse in an isoflurane chamber followed by cervical dislocation.\nHarvest the spleen, inguinal (subiliac), and axillary lymph nodes of the mouse and transfer them to a 60 mm × 10 mm dish with 3 mL of R10 on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: The number of OT-I mice sacrificed may be adjusted depending on the number of tumor-bearing mice to be transferred. A typical yield of OT-I CD8+ T cells from a spleen and bilateral inguinal and axillary lymph nodes of OT-I CD8+ T cells is ~30-100 × 106 cells per mouse.",
    "Using the end barrel of a 1 mL syringe, macerate the spleen in 3 mL of RBL buffer through the strainer. Incubate for 3 min at RT, and terminate the reaction by adding 3 mL of cold R10 medium.\nMash the lymph nodes until only connective tissues remain. Rinse the filter with R10. Transfer the cell suspension into a new 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge at 500 × g, 4 °C for 6 min.\nDecant the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in 3 mL of MACS buffer. Pass the cell suspension through a new 70 µm cell strainer to remove any flocs.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Decant the supernatant.\nUse a mouse CD8+ T cell isolation kit (see the Table of Materials) to purify CD8+ T cells by negative selection, as per the manufacturer's protocol.\n\t\tNOTE: When using kits from other companies, follow the manufacturer's instructions.\nKeep the purified cell suspension on ice. Take a small sample of cells and mix with trypan blue to count cells using a hemocytometer.\nDetermine the percentage of OT-I (live/dead-CD8+Va2+) cells by flow cytometry.\n\tNOTE: Simultaneous staining of congenic markers and the transgenic TCR should be performed to verify the correct phenotype of the cells prior to transfer.\n\t\nAdd 5 × 104-1 × 105 cells into 1 mL of FACS buffer in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube, and centrifuge the cell suspension at 350 × g, 4 °C for 3 min.\nDiscard the supernatant, and disperse the cells by flicking the bottom of the tube. Place the tube on ice.\nPrepare the following conjugated antibody mixtures (diluted in 100 µL FACS buffer): anti-CD8, 1:200; anti-TCR Vα2, 1:100; anti-CD45.1, 1:200; anti-CD45.2, 1:200; and live/dead, 1:200 (refer to the Table of Materials).",
    "Vortex the antibody cocktail and centrifuge at 15,000 × g for 3 min to pellet antibody aggregates. Store the cocktail on ice and protect it from light.\nResuspend the cells with 100 µL of antibody cocktail and thoroughly mix by flicking the tube. Incubate in the dark for 30 min on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid disturbing the antibody aggregates at the bottom of the tube.\nWash the pellets twice with 1 mL of FACS buffer. Centrifuge at 350 × g, 4 °C for 3 min. Resuspend the cells in 200 µL of FACS buffer, and transfer the cell suspension to a FACS tube.\n\t\tNOTE: To maintain the viability of the OT-I cells to be transferred, test the specimen as soon as possible. If the stained OT-I cells cannot be tested immediately, keep the cells in the dark on ice or refrigerate at 4 °C until analysis. Alternatively, the samples can be resuspended in 1-4% paraformaldehyde for extended storage (16 h) to prevent deterioration.\nRun the specimen on a flow cytometer. Calculate the percentage of live/dead-CD8+Va2+ cells by dividing the number of live/dead-CD8+Vα2+ cells by the number of live/dead- cells.\nDetermine the absolute number of OT-I cells (live/dead-CD8+Va2+) by multiplying the percentage of live/dead-CD8+Va2+ cells by the viable cell number obtained in step 4.3.9.\nAdjust the concentration of OT-I cells (live/dead-CD8+Va2+) to 1.5 × 106 /mL with PBS.\nInject 3 × 105 distinct congenically marked OT-I cells (live/dead-CD8+Va2+) in 200 µL of PBS intravenously into two groups of B16F10-OVA-bearing mice (tumor-bearing mice divided into donor and recipient mice from step 3.8).\n\t\nWithdraw 200 µL of OT-I cell (live/dead-CD8+Va2+) suspension into a 100 U insulin syringe (29 G), and remove bubbles as in step 3.2.",
    "Place the mouse separately in a cage with an infrared lamp over the cage for 5-10 min to dilate the tail vein. Immobilize the mouse with a restraining device of appropriate size. Pull the tail to straighten it and spray with 75% ethanol to make the vein visible.\nHold the syringe parallel to the vein and insert it into the vein at an angle of 0-15°. Pull back the plunger slightly, and if blood enters the barrel, slowly and steadily inject the suspension at a rate of no more than 1 mL/min.\n\t\tNOTE: Resistance or swelling at the injection site indicates that the needle is not inside the vein; the injection site should be moved proximally.\nAfter the injection is completed, remove the syringe, and press the insertion area gently for 3-5 s to stop bleeding. Return the mouse to the cage and closely observe it for a few minutes for adverse reactions. If it has normal mobility and nasal discharge, place it back in the company of the other mice.\n5. Dissect tumor mass from tumor-bearing donor mice\nNOTE: Maintain sterile conditions during surgery in sections 5 and 6. Sterilize all surgical instruments by autoclaving before and after each use. Disinfect the operating area in the biosafety cabinet with 75% ethanol followed by ultraviolet irradiation. Wear a clean gown, cap, face mask, and sterile gloves.\nEight to ten days after the adoptive transfer, select donor mice bearing comparable tumor mass of ~5 mm diameter (soybean-sized) for transplantation surgery.\nPrepare a 100 mm × 20 mm dish in a biosafety cabinet, and add 10 mL of sterile ice-cold PBS.\nEuthanize a tumor-bearing donor mouse in an isoflurane chamber followed by cervical dislocation. Immerse the mouse in 75% ethanol for 3-5 min and transfer to the biosafety cabinet.",
    "NOTE: The following procedures in this step must be performed in a biosafety cabinet to maintain strict asepsis.\nPlace the mouse on a dissection board covered with clean absorbent paper in a supine position. Restrain the mouse limbs with dissection needles.\nCut the skin along the midline from above the urethral orifice to the xiphoid with scissors. Stretch the skin towards the left side of the mouse body with tweezers and restrain the skin with dissection needles.\nExcise the tumor, keeping its capsule as intact as possible. Carefully and gently remove the connective tissue near the tumor with surgical scissors.\n\tNOTE: To maintain the integrity of the tumor, do not peel off the tumor capsule or cut the tumor tissue into pieces.\nPlace the tumor tissue in a 100 mm × 20 mm dish containing 10 mL of sterile ice-cold PBS for subsequent transplantation.\n6. Subcutaneous transplantation of donor-derived tumor onto the tumor-matched recipient mice\nNOTE: The allograft is supposed to be implanted into the mouse's lower flank on the same side as the previously existing tumor to make two tumors drain to the identical lymph node. In the protocol presented here, as the B16F10-OVA tumor was implanted subcutaneously on the left inguinal region of the mouse (section 3), the donor-derived tumor tissue was transplanted onto the left flank of the recipient in this step. The transplantation site can be adapted to the first-implanted tumor site.\nAnesthetize a tumor-matched recipient mouse with 250 mg/kg of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol via intraperitoneal injection. Pinch the toe of an extensor limb of the mouse to assess the level of anesthesia and wait for lack of pain reflex, which indicates the proper depth of anesthesia for performing the surgery. If vocalization or hind limb withdrawal is observed, further inject 0.01−0.03 mL of 2,2,2-tribromoethanol.",
    "NOTE: The tumor-matched recipient mouse should be the same sex as the donor mouse that provides the allograft to avoid rejection issues.\nUse veterinary ointment on eyes to prevent dryness. Shave the left flank of the mouse with an electric shaver. Apply a depilatory cream to remove the remaining hair.\n\tNOTE: Avoid abrading the skin, which may increase the risk of contamination and infection.\nPlace the mouse in the biosafety cabinet. Place it in the prone position on a dissection board covered with clean absorbent paper, with the mouse's vertical axis parallel to and its head to the right side of the experimenter.\n\tNOTE: The following procedures in this step must be performed in a biosafety cabinet to maintain strict asepsis.\nRub the skin of the shaved area with cotton soaked in povidone-iodine.\n\tNOTE: Use povidone-iodine instead of 75% ethanol for sterilization to prevent loss of body heat.\nLift the skin at the center point between the mouse hip joints with surgical tweezers. Use the scissors to make a 5 mm-long vertical excision. Extend the cut rostrally along the dorsal midline to ~10-15 mm.\nPerform a sharp dissection by inserting the closed tips of the scissors into the incision and then opening to separate the peritoneum of the left flank from the skin and soft tissue.\n\tNOTE: To avoid causing damage to the subcutaneous tissue and peritoneum, lift the skin at the center of the incision, and then insert the closed scissors as close to the skin as possible.\nMake a skin pocket at the left flank by performing sharp dissection several times. Deposit the encapsulated, intact donor-derived tumor mass into the capsule.\n\tNOTE: Mice in the sham-operated control group receive the same surgery operation without the donor-derived tumor transplantation.",
    "Close the incision by interrupted suture (see Materials List). Place 2-3 sutures for each incision. Disinfect the skin around the cut with cotton soaked in povidone-iodine.\n\tNOTE: There should be 5 mm between two consecutive stitches and a 3 mm distance from the incision.\nPlace the mouse in the lateral position in a clean and warm cage. Monitor it continuously until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nAdminister buprenorphine subcutaneously at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg body weight every 8 h three times after surgery to alleviate the pain. Monitor the mouse's eating, drinking, moving, and the area operated on. Return the transplant recipient to the company of other animals only after it has fully recovered.\n\tNOTE: The mouse typically recovers from the trauma of the surgery within 3 days. If the mouse is not back to normal feeding and mobility and shows any manifestations of infection, consult a veterinarian for interventions or euthanize it.\nSacrifice (euthanize the animals as in step 4.3.2) the mice at the indicated time points, and recover the cells of interest for flow cytometric analysis.\nSubscription Required.
