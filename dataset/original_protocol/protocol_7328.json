Amplify junctions with NEB OneTaq Hot Start High-Fidelity 2× Master, and run PCR reactions in gel to verify amplification size. Successful amplifications are sentfor Sanger sequencing. Verified constructs with Sanger sequencing are then cultured in 2 mL of LB with appropriate antibiotics overnight in a shaking incubator (37 °C, 250 rpm). Plasmids from overnight culture wereextracted using Zyppy Plasmid Miniprep Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Prepped plasmids can then be sequenced using whole plasmid sequencing services, such as plasmidsaurus (www.plasmidsaurus.com/[href=http://www.plasmidsaurus.com/]).Construction of Mutagenesis Plasmid (MP) –aTc-MP6 plasmid (Addgene #189935)An Anhydrotetracycline-Inducible Mutagenesis Plasmid (aTc-MP) was constructed as follows:Amplify the mutagenic operon (danQ926, dam, seqA, emrR, ugi, and cda1) and origin of replication (CloDF13) from the L-arabinose–inducible MP6 plasmid (Addgene #69669).Primer #3: Mutagenic operon Forward primer: acccgtttttttggacgcgtPrimer #4: Mutagenic operon Reverse primer: agtcaaaagcctccgaccggPrimer #5: CloDF13 Forward primer: tacgtgccaagccaaataggPrimer #6: CloDF13 Reverse primer: ggctgacttcaggtgctacaAmplify the anhydrotetracycline-inducible system (pTet and TetR) and kanamycin resistance gene (KanR) from pAJM.011 (Addgene #108529).Primer #7: pTet and KanR Forward primer: cagtggaacgaaaaatcaatPrimer #8: pTet and KanR Reverse primer: tcagtatctctatcactgatPrimer #9: TetR Forward primer: ctcggtaccaaattccagaaPrimer #10: TetR Reverse primer: ctcacttccctgttaagtatUse NEBuilder HiFi to assemble the fragments according to manufacturer’s instructions.Transform assembly reactions to NEB 10-beta Competent E. coli cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Grow transformations on LB agar plates containing kanamycin and 1% glucose.

    "Plasmids fromovernight culture were extracted using Zyppy Plasmid Miniprep Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Prepped plasmids can then be sequenced using whole plasmid sequencing services, such as plasmidsaurus(www.plasmidsaurus.com/[href=http://www.plasmidsaurus.com/]).Sequence-verified aTc-MP6 can then be transformed into E. coli C600 containing the P1 phage (available upon request from Crook Lab). E. coli C600 containing both P1 phage and aTc-MP is the starting point for the construction of the diversification strain.Preparation and transformation of electrocompetent cells to generate Diversification Strain Inoculate the selected diversification strain (E. coli C600 strain containing mutagenesis plasmid and P1 phage) into 2 mL of LB media containing 50 µg/mL of kanamycin and grow overnight in a shaking incubator (37 °C, 250 rpm).Dilute 500 μL of overnight culture into 50 mL of LB media (1:100 dilution), and grow in a shaking incubator (37 °C, 250 rpm) to OD600 = 0.8.Transfer culture to a 50 mL tube and chill on ice for 10–15 min.Spin down cells at 3,000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min.Remove supernatant and resuspend pellets in 25 mL of ice-cold 10% glycerol.Spin down cells at 3,000 × g and 4 °C for 5 min.Repeat steps 5–6 two times (total 2 washes). Repeat more times if having trouble with arcing during electroporation.Resuspend washed cells in 1 mL of 10% glycerol in microcentrifuge tubes, and spin at 3,000 × gand 4 °C for 3 min.Resuspend pellets in 0.5 mL of 10% glycerol.Place the electroporation cuvette on ice for 2 min.Transfer 50 μL of the cells to a chilled microcentrifuge tube. Add 1 μL of the phagemid DNA (>50 ng).Carefully transfer the cell/DNA mix into the chilled cuvette without introducing bubbles, and make sure that the cells deposit across the bottom of the cuvette.Electroporate cuvette with the transformation mixture on an electroporator (e.g., Bio-Rad EC1).",
    "Time constant should be 5.0–6.0 ms for successful transformation.Immediately add 1 mL of Super Optimal Broth (SOC) medium to the electroporation cuvette, mix by pipetting up and down, and transfer to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.Place the transformation reaction in a shaking incubator (37 °C, 250 rpm) for 1 h.Centrifuge the cells at 3,000 × g for 2 min and resuspend cells in 100 μL of DPBS.Spread cells onto a prewarmed selective plate (e.g., LB + kanamycin + chloramphenicol), and incubate at 37 °C overnight.Induction of mutagenesis Subinoculate overnight culture of diversification strain in LB with 1% glucose, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol into 2 mL of LB containing kanamycin and chloramphenicol (no glucose, 1:100 dilution) in a culture tube.Induce mutagenesis by adding 200 ng/μL of aTc (2 μL of 100 ng/μL of aTc) to the subinoculated culture.Grow induced culture in a shaking incubator (37 °C, 250 rpm) for 8–16 h depending on desired mutation rate (3.4 × 10–7 substitutions per bp per generation).For the first cycle of IDE, start with one colony for overnight cultures.For cycles 2 and beyond of IDE, start with a mixed population from overnight outgrowth after infection of the diversification strain.Phage production Inoculate 2 μL of strains after the mutagenesis step (containing P1, aTc-MP, and the phagemid) or after the screening/selection step (containing P1 and the phagemid) into 2 mL of LB media containing chloramphenicol, andgrow overnight in a shaking incubator (37 °C, 250 rpm).Dilute 150 μL of O/N culture into 15 mL of ePLM (1:100 dilution) in 50 mL reactor tubes, and grow in the shaking incubator (37 °C, 250 rpm) to OD600 = 0.8–1.0.Add 150 μL of 20% L-arabinose (1/100 culture volume), and place back in the shaking incubator (37 °C, 250 rpm) for 2 h. Cultures should clarify as inFigure 2.",
    "Transfer the cultures to a 50 mL centrifuge tube, and add 400 μL of chloroform (2.5:100 volume).Place the tubes on ice for 5 min with gentle mixing or pipetting every 1 min.Centrifuge at 3,000 × g and 4 °C for 10 min, and transfer the supernatant to sterile tubes for storage. Phage lysate is stable at 4 °C for 1 year and indefinitely at -80 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4535/bioprotoc-12-20-4535-g002.jpgFigure 2. Cell cultures before and after phage production. Top: Strains after the mutagenesis step or after the screening/selection step are subinoculated into fresh ePLM and grown to OD600 = 1.0. Bottom: Cell cultures are lysed after 2 h of induction with L-arabinose.Phage infection Inoculate the screening/selection strain containing P1 into 2 mL of LB media for the screening step or LB media containing kanamycin for diversification step, and grow overnight in a shaking incubator (37 °C, 250 rpm).Subinoculate overnight culture into ePLM (1:100 dilution), and grow in a shaking incubator (37 °C, 250 rpm) to OD600 = 1.0.Centrifuge at 3,000 × gand 4 °C for 5 min, and resuspend the pellet in 1/3 volume of fresh ePLM.Mix 1 mL of cells with 1 mL of phage lysate in a 14 mL culture tube.Place the infection mixture in a standing incubator (37 °C) for 20 min and then for another 20 min in a shaking incubator (37 °C, 250 rpm).Add 1 mL of SOC containing 200 mM of sodium citrate to the infection reaction to quench the infection. Place the reaction in a shaking incubator (37 °C, 250 rpm) for 1 h.To eliminate the uninfected cells, transfer the infection reaction to 50 mL of LB media containing kanamycin and chloramphenicol for the diversification step or LB agar plates containing chloramphenicol for the screening step.",
    "To count the library size of the infection, spot plate on LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotics.In a 96-well plate, perform serial dilutions of the infection reaction with ePLM. Perform five dilutions, from 1:10 to 1:105. Add 180 μL of ePLM to rows A-E. In row A, add 20 μL of the infection reaction.Preform the rest of the dilutions by adding 20 μL of the previous dilution to the next row. Make sure to mix well and change pipette tips after each dilution. This step can be done with multichannel pipettors.Using a multichannel pipettor, plate 5 μL of each infection reaction dilution on LB agar plates containing kanamycin and chloramphenicol for the diversification step or LB agar plates containing chloramphenicol forthe screening step.Incubate spotted plates overnight in a standing incubator (37 °C).Count CFU/mL in the morning to determine library size. Remember to multiply the number of colonies counted by the dilution factor corresponding to that row to obtain CFU/mL.To check whether phage production and infection steps were carried correctly, run the following controls:Infect desired strains with another phage lysate that has already generated an expected library size. This control will determine if phage production or infection failed.Plate uninfected cells on LB agar plates containing chloramphenicol or kanamycin to test whether the infected strain has resistance to either antibiotic.Introduction of P1 phage into P1-free strains for desired screening strains Produce phage lysate from a strain containing P1 and phagemid.Induce phage production (see section: Phage production).Infect the strain of interest (see section: Phage infection).Streak 10 μL of infection reaction on standard size LB agar plates to obtain single colonies.Screen 10–20 colonies for P1 using P1-specific primers (fragment size 296 bp):Forward primers: ACGACCATGAAAGCTCTTCACCCGTAGReverse primers: GCTTATTCGCACCTTCCCTAAAAACAAAGATGTTTGTAGNote: To increase P1 infection efficiency to a new strain, use 1:10 cells:phage lysate by volume.",
    "Note that this ratio differs for infection with phagemid-containing particles that were discussed previously. Screening/Selection Freshly infected screening/selection strains are directly used from the prior step.Screening/selection steps are different based on the application.Example 1: Growth-based selection for increasing the utilization of a specific sugar.Ensure that the screening/selection strain achieves a low, but nonzero growth rate in minimal media containing the sugar as the sole carbon source.Select improved variants by culturing the library in minimal media containing the sugar as the sole carbon source.Subinoculate culture 2–5 times to select rapidly-growing strains before transfer back to the diversification strain. Repeated subinoculations without transfer run the risk of selecting for strains withgenomic mutations.Example 2: Biosensor-enabled screening for increasing the production of a molecule or protein.Include a biosensor in the screening/selection strain that couples productivity to fluorescence, where wild-type productivity remains in the linear range of the biosensor.Culture the screening/selection strain under conditions that favor biomolecule production.Screen for high-producing variants via Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS).As above, isolated variants can be grown and re-sorted via FACS several times before transfer back to the diversification strain.Mutagenesis, Phage production, Phage infection, and Screening/Selection steps are repeated until a satisfactory variant is found.After screening is complete Plasmids may be extracted from screened/selected libraries and used for next-generation sequencing to measure the frequencies of common mutations. Illumina iSeq 100 was used to achieve 80–100× sequencing depth.Other sequencing machines and services that can reach similar sequencing depth can be used. Illumina whole-genome sequencing kits and IDT® for Illumina® DNA/RNA UD Indexes are used for librarypreparation and sequencing. Equivalent NGS primers can be used to index different samples.

To directly compare evolved pathways to the wild type, evolved pathways may be cloned into a fresh phagemid backbone,or both evolved, and wild-type pathways may be integrated into the genome.The performance of individual isolates may be compared to the screening/selection strain containing the wild-type phagemid using additional assays (e.g., growth in 96-well plates or productivity in shake flasks, followed byHPLC analysis).The most productive variants may be used as is or subjected to additional rounds of IDE.Appendix 1: Running gels Confirm cloning and PCR amplifications using a 1% agarose gel.Dissolve 300 mg of agarose in 30 mL of 1× TAE buffer by heating until boiling.Add 3 μL of SYBR Safe DNA gel stain to the liquid gel.Cast the gel by pouring into gel trays with combs in place and allow to solidify.Run the loaded gel with 5 μL of Quick-Load 1 kb Plus DNA Ladder at 120 V for 25–30 min.

    "Appendix 2: Best practices for handling phage:  All steps containing phage lysate should be conducted in the BSL2 hood to avoid contaminating other E. coli experiments. Quarantine your P1 work as much as possible from your other projects. This can be done by designating a separate bench space and materials for projects involving phages.Use filter tips when pipetting P1 phage lysate.Use Virkon to wipe off all surfaces and tools after handling phages.Store phage lysate in screw-top 15 or 50 mL centrifuge tubes. Infections and phage production are also done in these tubes.If possible, store P1 lysates in a 4 °C fridge that is not used for other E. coli experiments.Do not keep old plates of bacteria containing P1 as phages can initiate lysis in stationary colonies (<1 week in 4 °C)."
