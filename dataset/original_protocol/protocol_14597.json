    "All experimental techniques must be conducted in accordance with Institutional Care and Use Committee guidelines.\n1. X-ray Imaging Acquisition\nSoftware Overview (See Figure 1 for an Overview of Software Settings).\nSelect the Capture button directly below the File tab.\nIn the Settings drop-down menu, select Current Session.\nSelect Standard Exposure in drop-down box located under Exposure Time.\nSet the Exposure Time to 2.00 min, and No. Exposures to 1. Set the X Binning and Y Binning to 2 pixels. See Figure 1.\nSelect Final Accumulation from the Export Options drop-down menu.\nIn the Illumination settings, select X-Ray from the Illumination Source drop-down menu. The default KVP is set at 35.\nSelect Autoselect in the Apply Reference File drop-down menu to apply the corresponding X-ray reference file. (See Section 2).\nIn the Set Camera To settings, set the f-stop to 2.51.\nSet the FOV (Field of View) to 125.64 for PN10 mice.\nSet the Focal Plane to 13, and in the drop-down menu beside the Focal Plane slider, select X-Ray.\nFor X-rays, set the Excitation Filter and the Emission Filter to 0 in the drop-down menu.\nSave current session by clicking New on the top next to Settings. Enter name for New Acquire Settings File, e.g., \"Jove Single Exposure Event for making a Protocol.\" See Figure 2.\nCreating an X-ray Imaging Protocol\nClick on the Create/Edit Protocols button on the right side of the open window.\nAs new Protocol pop-up window appears, click the New button in the upper right-hand corner\nEnter the name that the protocol will save under, for example \"Jove Demo Protocol\", and click OK. (See Figure 3).",
    "On the bottom of the Protocol pop-up window in Protocol Steps, ensure that Step 1 is highlighted in red text, Capture New Images is selected, and Do Nothing is selected in the Before Image Capture drop down menu.\nIn Capture Setting, select the recently generated single exposure event from Step 1.1.12.\nSelect Wait (sec) from the After Image Capture drop-down menu.\nClick the Edit button, type 180 into the pop-up box, and click OK to add a 3 min wait time after each 2 min acquisition.\nDuplicate Step 1 by right clicking the Step 1 tab and selecting Duplicate Step. Create 23 duplicates for a 2 hr observation period. (See Figure 4).\nOn the final step (Step 24), change the After Image Capture setting to Do Nothing from Wait (sec).\nClick the Save button and exit the Protocol Editor.\n2. Illumination Reference Files\nNote: Apply X-ray illumination reference files to an X-ray image in order to automatically correct for variations in detector uniformity of the X-ray images obtained throughout experiment. The procedures outlined below are specific to the Bruker In Vivo Animal Imaging Systems; other in vivo imaging systems may be used.\nGenerate an illumination reference file by opening the molecular imaging software and clicking on the Capture button.\nUsing the pop-up menu, establish the X-ray capture settings in Illumination Source (see suggested settings in section 1 above) and then select Illumination Reference in the exposure type. This can be found under the Standard Exposures drop down box. (See Figure 5).\nRemove all samples from the image station. Set the X and Y binning to 4 x 4 binning. Refer to Table 1: Illumination reference file exposure times to determine the accurate exposure time.\nPress Expose.",
    "Apply the reference file by selecting Auto Select from the drop down menu under Apply Reference File. (See Figure 6). The illumination reference file will now be automatically applied to all X-ray images captured with the same camera settings. Steps 2.1 - 2.4 will not need to be repeated if same camera settings are utilized in subsequent experiments.\n\tNote: An illumination reference file can be applied after image acquisition, or if an error message occurs after auto-selection of reference files. Apply illumination reference files post-image capture using the following series of commands in the Navigation Panel of the molecular imaging software: Image > Image Math > Type: Task > Calculate: Illumination correction. Select the input image (X) that you would like to apply the illumination reference file (Y) to. Rename the corrected file (Z). (See Figure 7).\n3. Animal Handling\nAcquiring Animals\nPurchase pregnant dams from commercial breeders or breed female mice in house at 12 weeks of age (or older) in accordance with institutional guidelines.\nHouse newborn mice with lactating mothers up to postnatal day (PN) 10.\nAnimal Anesthesia (PN 10)\nPrepare a Ketamine/Xylazine cocktail to anesthetize PN 10 mice for prolonged anesthetic effects lasting up to 40 min. Add 500 µl of Ketamine (100 mg/ml) to 75 µl of Xylazine (100 mg/ml). Dilute 1:10 in a 0.9% saline solution to make a Ketamine (100 mg/kg)/Xylazine (10 mg/kg) anesthetic cocktail.\nWeigh the newborn mice.\nUsing a 3/10 syringe with a 31 G 5/16 inch (8 mm) needle, administer 10 µl/g of body weight of anesthesia with an intraperitoneal injection.\nKeep animals dry and insulated to prevent excessive loss of body heat.\n4. Tracheal Instillations",
    "Prepare an intratracheal saline solution comprised of 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, and 10 mM HEPES; pH = 7.4. The osmolality of this solution should be 319 mosmol/kg H2O.\nMount anesthetized animals ventral side up onto a sloped surgical board using surgical tape. Ensurethat the animals' heads are at the top of the incline.\nPerform a toe pinch to ensure that animals are anesthetized and ready for surgery. Disinfect all surgical areas, instruments, and thoracic region of the animal.\nMake a small (3 mm) incision in the anterior-medial ventral aspect of the neck (throat region) using a surgical scalpel, size 11. Push aside the platysma and anterior tracheal muscles using blunted forceps in order to visualize and access the trachea.\nInstill 3 µl/g of weight (approximately 10 - 30 µl final volume) of saline via the exposed trachea using a 31 G 5/16 inch (8 mm) needle. The minor incision is left open during animal imaging and usually heals itself well. Consult with local Division of Animal Resource to determine if the incision can likewise be left open. Otherwise, sutures may be required.\n5. Animal Imaging\nPosition the pups ventrally on a clear-bottom, removable, animal imaging tray. Center the animals so that the X-ray beam will be directly over the thoracic area.\nFor odd numbered animal cohorts, place the first pup directly in the middle of the tray, and for even numbered cohorts place the first pup just left of center so that when the other animals are placed on the tray all of the animals are centered.\nReturn the imaging tray to the X-ray imaging cabinet and close the cabinet door.",
    "Turn on the animal thermal control unit to maintain the anesthetized animals' body temperature. Use the high setting to achieve a chamber temperature of approximately 35 - 37 °C. Turn on animal anesthesia unit (vaporized isoflurane delivered via oxygen) to ensure animals are anesthetized and immobilized throughout duration of 2 hr imaging procedure.\nExecuting X-ray imaging protocol\n\t\nClick on Capture and select the appropriate protocol, e.g., \"Jove Demo Protocol,\" from the Protocol drop-down menu. (See Figure 8).\nClick the Execute Selected Protocol button on the molecular imaging software.\n\t\tNote: A pop-up window will appear to track the status of the image acquisition, when the protocol is complete the window will disappear. The X-ray dose is low, < than 0.3 mRem or about 10 times less than a dental X-ray. As with other X-Ray procedures, there is no residual radiation.\nWhen the 2 hr acquisition session is complete, remove the animals from the imaging tray and return them to their cage. Monitor animals for full recovery before returning to racks.\n6. Data Analysis\nNote: Molecular imaging software allows for quantification and the translation of X-ray pixel intensity into rate of lung fluid clearance. The steps below outline the procedures needed to normalize X-ray images and quantify intensities in defined regions of interest (ROI).\nDesign an ROI template\n\tNote: A region of interest template must be created specific to the captured X-ray images during the 2 hr study, and should be used in order to compare X-ray intensities amongst experimental groups. Since small volumes of saline challenges typically accumulate in the left upper lobe of the lung4-6, the ROI(s) should focus on this portion of the lung.\n\t\nOpen the first and last x-ray image in the 2 hr set. Select the window of the first x-ray image.",
    "In the Navigation toolbar, select Manual-ROIs > New ROI Set.\nClick ROI Ellipse and create a ROI that adequately covers the mouse's left lung.An ROI is not defined until the red, outlined ROI is dragged to a different position. A defined ROI will be outlined in blue with a number.\nIf multiple pups are imaged, click on the red, outlined ROI and drag to the left lungs of the other mice to create more individual ROIs in the same set. Drag the red, outlined ROI to an area with a clear background to create a background ROI.\n\t\t\nSelect Pointer Selection to position the ROIs to lie over each mouse's left lung, directly under the second rib.\nIn the top toolbar, click Image Display.\nCheck Overlay in the Image Display dialog to overlay the last x-ray image while maintaining the set ROI locations. If necessary, select Pointer Selection in the Navigation toolbar to adjust the positions of the ROIs and ensure adequate lung coverage in both images.\nIn the Manual ROI dialog, select Template > Save to Template. Name the template and click OK.\nClose both images. Select No when prompted to save changes.\nApply the ROI template to each X-ray image captured to analyze fluid clearance by opening all images taken during the study. Start by selecting an open file and click Manual ROIs > Template.\nSelect the previously created ROI template from the drop down menu and click Apply to All Open Documents.\nExport Numerical ROI Data from the Images to a Spreadsheet\nIn the upper left hand corner, click File > Export Data > ROI.\nCheck As Displayed and Auto Open in Excel in the pop-up dialog.\nSelect Export All Open Documents.\nName the file and click Save.\nClose molecular imaging software.",
