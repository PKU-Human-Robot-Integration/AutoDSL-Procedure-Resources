    "The high-level workflow for mAbScale is shown in Figure 2. Each step has more sophisticated inner decision branches, loops, and combinatorics. A detailed algorithmic workflow describing the calculation process is presented in Supplementary Figure 1. The application output is saved in a spreadsheet format in the user-selected folder. The output file consists of multiple separate worksheets, which can be categorized as the user input, molecular weight calculations, and references for the average isotopic mass derivations (example output is provided in supplemental tables). The user input worksheets include the protein amino acid sequences and other information entered by the user, averaged elemental masses, and glycan masses, which are used to calculate the elemental composition and different molecular weights. The molecular weight calculation sheets include the chemical composition of various forms, the reduced mass with and without glycosylation and chemical modification, and the intact mass with and without glycosylation and chemical modification. Sheets containing half-antibody masses will be generated automatically if the user enters two different HCs and/or two different LCs in the user input page, since half-antibodies are primary impurities that need to be identified and quantified relative to the desired heterodimer. The source code for mAbScale can be accessed through the following repository: https://github.com/kkhatri99/mAbScale.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65298/65298fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Overview of the steps involved in the calculation of elemental compositions and masses using the application. Color coding can be used to link to the process flow described in Supplementary Figure 1.

Opening the mAbscale application\nOpen the software application by double-clicking on the icon for the executable file.\n2. Sequence entry\nEnter the heavy-chain and light-chain sequences in the respective text boxes marked with 1 without any spaces.",
    "For bsAbs, add additional heavy or light chains in the second set of text boxes marked 2. Leave 2 blank for mAbs with identical heavy chains and light chains.\nCheck the N-Terminal Cyclization and/or C-Terminal Clipping check boxes, if these heavy chain terminal variants are applicable.\nAdd any chemical modifications, including linker and payload for ADC molecules, to the Heavy Chain Chem Mod and/or Light Chain Chem Mod text boxes.\n\t\t\nSpecify modifications as elemental compositions, such as CaCl2. The modification will be added to the respective protein subunit or chain.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: A chemical composition may also be subtracted from a subunit or chain by prefixing the elemental composition with a - sign. For example, -H2O will subtract a water molecule from the subunit composition and mass.\n3. Specifying the number of disulfide bonds\nSpecify the number of disulfide bonds in the protein molecules in the text box marked Total Number of Disulfides.\nEnter the number of unreduced HC disulfides into the Unreduced HC Disulfides text box and the number of unreduced LC disulfides into the Unreduced LC Disulfides text box, depending on the extent of reduction (complete vs. partial).\n\tNOTE: The reduced mass analysis of mAb subunits involves the reduction/separation of the disulfide-linked heavy and light chains.\nIf glycosylation is present on the mAb light chain, check the Light Chain is Glycosylated check box.\n4. Setting the output folder and running the application\nClick on the Browse button to select an output folder for the Output Folder text box.\nEnter the output file name without a file extension (automatically saves as .xlsx) into the Excel File (no ext) text box.\nClick on the Submit button to start the application. The output file can be found in the designated folder.",
    "​NOTE: The elemental masses and the list of glycans can be customized by editing the delimited text files Element_Mass.csv (Supplementary Coding File 1) and Glycan.csv (Supplementary Coding File 2), respectively. These files must be placed in the same folder as the mAbScale.exe (Supplementary Coding File 3) executable file for the application to execute. The application will be closed automatically after one execution. The user will have to start the app again if a second calculation is needed.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
