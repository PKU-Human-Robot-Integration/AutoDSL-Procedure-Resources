    "1. Preparation of the Native Soluble Collagen Solution\nPrepare or purchase 200 mg of acidified, soluble, type I collagen from rat tails at 1–3 mg/ml using standard isolation protocols, such as reported by Piez et al.15\nScale the amount of starting material based on the desired end volume of modified collagen solutions. Approximately make 25–30 ml of methylated and 25–30 ml of succinylated collagen solutions, each at 3 mg/ml, from 200 mg of soluble native collagen.\n2. Collagen Methylation\nDilute 100 mg of the native, acidified (pH 2–3) collagen solution to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml with ice cold sterile water and keep the solution on ice to prevent gelation.\nAdjust the pH of the collagen solution to 9–10 with a few drops of 1 N NaOH and stir at RT for 30 min. Observe the collagen precipitate, causing the solution to become cloudy.\nSpin down the precipitated collagen solution at 3,000 × g for 25 min. A clear, gel-like precipitate should be visible in the bottom of the tubes. Aspirate and properly dispose of the supernatant fluid.\nResuspend the precipitated collagen in 200 ml of methanol with 0.1 N HCl and allow the methylation reaction to occur with stirring at RT for 4 days. The collagen will not dissolve, but should break apart into very small visible pieces that will make the solution cloudy.\nAfter the methylation, centrifuge the solution at 3,000 × g for 25 min to pellet the methylated collagen. Aspirate and dispose of the acidified methanol supernatant.\nDissolve the methylated collagen in 25 ml of sterile PBS, giving a concentration of approximately 3 mg/ml, with repeated pipetting, and filter the solution through a 60 µm cell strainer. Adjust the pH of the solution to 7.3–7.4 using 20 µl increments of 1 N NaOH.",
    "Assess the concentration of the solution using a commercial rat collagen ELISA kit or hydroxyproline assay kit. Dilute the solution to 3 mg/ml with sterile PBS.\nSterilize the methylated collagen solution by transferring it to a glass bottle with a screw cap, carefully layering 3 ml of chloroform at the bottom of the bottle, allow the bottle to set O/N at 4 °C, and then aseptically remove and store the top layer, which is the methylated collagen.\nStore the solution at 4 °C for use within 1 month.\n3. Collagen Succinylation\nDilute the other 100 mg of the native, acidified (pH 2–3) collagen solution to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml with ice cold sterile water and keep the solution on ice to prevent gelation.\nAdjust the pH of the collagen solution to 9–10 with a few drops of 1 N NaOH and stir at RT for 30 min. The collagen should precipitate, causing the solution to become cloudy.\nDissolve 40 mg of succinic anhydride (0.4 mg per mg of collagen) in 10 ml of acetone (1/20th the volume of the collagen solution). Slowly (in approximately 0.5 ml increments) add this mixture to the collagen solution with stirring while continuously monitoring the pH. Maintain the pH above 9.0 by adding 1 or 2 drops of 1 N NaOH as the pH approaches 9.0.\nContinue stirring at RT for 120 min after adding all of the succinic anhydride in acetone. Observe the solution to become clear as the succinylated collagen dissolves. Periodically check the pH to ensure it remains above 9.0.\nAdjust the pH of the solution to 4.0 with 20 µl increments of 1 N HCl. Observe the solution cloudy again, as the succinylated collagen precipitates.",
    "After the succinylation, centrifuge the solution at 3,000 × g for 25 min to pellet the succinylated collagen. Aspirate and dispose of the acidified supernatant with unreacted succinic anhydride.\nDissolve the succinylated collagen in 25 ml of sterile PBS, giving a concentration of approximately 3 mg/ml, with repeated pipetting, and filter the solution through a 60 µm cell strainer. Adjust the pH of the solution to 7.3–7.4 using 20 µl increments of 1 N NaOH.\nAssess the concentration of the solution using a commercial collagen rat ELISA kit or hydroxyproline assay kit. Dilute the solution to 3 mg/ml with sterile PBS.\nSterilize the succinylated collagen solution by transferring it to a glass bottle with a screw cap, carefully layering 3 ml of chloroform at the bottom of the bottle, allow the bottle to set O/N at 4 °C, and then aseptically remove and store the top layer, which is the succinylated collagen.\nStore the solution at 4 °C for use within 1 month.\n4. Verification of the Collagen Modifications\nPrepare 1 ml samples from each of the native, methylated, and succinylated collagen solutions and dilute to a concentration of 0.1 mg/ml with sterile pure water for hydrogen ion titration. Further dilute the buffer at least 1,000-fold by dialysis against water through a 10 kDa cutoff membraneusing 3 solution changes for at least 4 hr each.\nAdjust the pH of the solutions to 7.3 with small amounts of NaOH and HCl. Using pH 7.3 as an arbitrary reference, perform hydrogen ion titration on each of the samples as described by Tanford16 to create titration curves for the native, methylated, and succinylated collagen solutions.",
    "Plot the change in pH per volume of acid added versus the number of bound H+ ions per molecule. The high pH “amino” range should show a shift in the succinylated collagen towards the neutral point (a loss of amine groups), and the low pH “carboxyl” range should show a leftward shift in the methylated collagen (a loss of carboxyl groups) and a rightward shift in the succinylated collagen (a gain in carboxyl groups), compared to the native collagen.\nAssess the efficacy of the succinylation reaction by determining the % of amino groups in the native collagen replaced by succinylation using the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBA) colorimetric method, following standard protocols17,18.\n5. Fabrication of Microfluidic Devices and Cell Seeding\nFabricate microfluidic devices using standard methods9. Use replica molding of PDMS from SU-8 masters on silicon defined using photolithography to create microfluidic cell culture chambers with 100 µm tall, 0.4–1.5 mm wide, and 1–10 mm long channels for cell growth.\nUse a plasma cleaner to oxidize the surfaces of the device and a glass slide, and then press together to bond. After sterilizing the device by exposure to UV light for at least 30 min, fill the chamber with 50 µg/ml fibronectin in sterile PBS and incubate at 37 °C for 45 min.\nSeed the device with cells, such as primary rat or human hepatocytes, which require a collagen gel for stabilization of phenotype or differentiation state. We use 20 µl of freshly isolated primary rat hepatocytes7,19 or commercially available cryopreserved primary human hepatocytes seeded at 14×106 cells/ml per device.\nAllow the cells to attach for 4–6 hr, and then wash out unattached cells and replace the plating media with growth media. Incubate O/N to ensure full cell spreading and create a confluent monolayer of cells.\n6. Layer-by-layer Collagen Deposition",
    "In a laminar flow tissue culture hood, prepare sufficient volumes of methylated and succinylated collagen solutions for 10 applications of each solution per device, as well as a few mls of media. Keep the solutions on ice. We use 20 µl (10–15 times the total device volume) of collagen per layer per device.\nBeginning with the methylated (polycationic) solution, alternate flushing the devices with 20 µl of methylated and then succinylated collagen solutions, waiting 1 min between each application. Flush the device a total of 10 times per solution, which should take approximately 20 min. Work quickly to minimize the amount of time the cells are without media.\nObserve collagen slowly accumulate at the inlet/outlet depending on its size. If the resistance to fluid flow increases, flush the device once or twice with media, and then continue layering.\nAfter applying all of the layers, rinse the device twice with fresh media and return to the incubator. Depending on the cell type, the extracellular matrix-induced morphological changes, such as enhanced polarization in hepatocytes, should be visible within a few hours.\nPrepare representative devices for transmission electron microscopy using standard methods9 to verify the presence of a collagen matrix assembly on top of the cultured cells.\n7. Stabilization of Cell Phenotype and Function\nImage the cell morphology, viability, and polarity using standard methods for the cell type. For hepatocytes, collect images over 14 days using phase microscopy, LIVE/DEAD staining for viability, and CMFDA dye for apical polarization to demonstrate the effects of the collagen deposition.\nFor cell morphology, flush the device through the inlet by pipette with 20 µl of PBS to rinse, inject 20 µl of PBS, and image the device using phase contrast microscopy.",
    "For LIVE/DEAD staining, flush the device through the inlet by pipette with 20 µl of PBS to rinse, inject 20 µl of LIVE/DEAD staining solution with DAPI prepared following the manufacturer's instructions, incubate for 30 min at 37 °C, rinse the device again with 20 µl of PBS, and image the device using fluorescence microscopy.\nFor bile canaliculi staining, flush the device through the inlet by pipette with 20 µl of PBS to rinse, inject 20 µl of 2 µM CMFDA staining solution with DAPI prepared following the manufacturer's instructions, incubate for 30 min at 37 °C, rinse the device again with 20 µl of PBS, and image the device using fluorescence microscopy.\nCollect the spent media and measure cellular metabolic products at appropriate time points over the culture duration to determine the cell function. For hepatocytes, measure the amount of albumin and urea in the spent media.\nPerform endpoint functional analyses on the cells themselves, such as assessing enzyme activity levels, antibody staining, or RNA analysis. For hepatocytes, induce and measure cytochrome P450 enzyme activities or phase II conjugation enzyme glutathione S-transferase.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
