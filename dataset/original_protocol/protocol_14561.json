    "All experiments were approved by the CIC bioGUNE institutional committees for animal care and handling. All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number of animals used. 3-months old male glycine N-methyltransferase (Gnmt) deficient (Gnmt−/−) and its wild type littermates (Gnmt+/+) were used.\n1. Cell Preparation and Lysis\nNOTE: Herein, Huh-7 (human hepatoma cell line) and THLE2 (human hepatic cell line) were used.\nMaintain cells in P100 plates in standard growth media at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% humidity.\nGrow cells in P100 plates plating at a density of 1.2–1.5 × 106 cells per dish by counting the cells using a Neubauer haemocytometry counting chamber.\n\t\nCulture Huh-7 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin-amphotericin B (PSA) and 1% glutamine.\nCulture THLE2 cells in culture dishes pre-coated with 0.01 mg/mL fibronectin, 0.01 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.03 mg/mL collagen type I dissolved in growth medium which consists of bronchial epithelial cell growth basal medium (BEGM) supplemented with growth factors (0.4% BPE, 0.1% insulin, 0.1% hydrocortisone, 0.1% retinoic acid, 0.1% transferrin, 0.1% triiodothyronine as well as 10% FBS, 1% PSA, 5 ng/mL epidermal growth factor (EGF) and 70 ng/mL phosphoethanolamine.\nAt the end point of the experiment, aspirate the media from the plates and wash cells with 5 mL of sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Lyse cells directly on the plate placed on ice using 500 µL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% nonidet P-40 (NP40), supplemented with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and 50 μM PR-619 for each P100 dish. Using a cell scraper, gently scrape the cells off the bottom of the plate into the Lysis medium.",
    "NOTE: Check that all the cells have detached from the plate by visually inspecting the plate base after the treatment.\nAlternatively, harvest cells by trypsinization by aspirating cell media and add 1 mL of 1x (0.05%) trypsin-EDTA to the plate, enough to cover the cells and placing the plate in the incubator set at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity for ~5 min ensuring all cells have detached from the plate. Add 2 mL of pre-warmed growth medium in order to stop trypsinization. Centrifuge at 150 g for 10 min and aspirate the supernatant. Wash with 1x PBS and centrifuge at 150 x g for 10 min. After aspirating the supernatant, add 500 µL of lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, supplemented with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and 50 μM PR-619 for each P100 dish.\n\tNOTE: The addition of the PR-619 is critical.\nCentrifuge at 15,500 x g and 4°C for 10 min. Transfer the supernatant to another tube and discard the pellet.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here, and samples stored at -80 °C until further analysis.\n2. Tissue Preparation and Lysis\nUpon animal sacrifice, collect mouse livers, wash with cold PBS, and snap freeze immediately in liquid nitrogen. Store the samples −80 °C until further analysis.\nHomogenize 75 mg fragments from snap-frozen/or fresh livers in 1 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% NP40, supplemented with complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail and 50 μM PR-619). Run the homogenizer at 6500 x rpm, 2 x 60 s each, with a 30 s pause (see Table of Materials).",
    "Centrifuge the samples in a microfuge at 15, 500 x g and 4 °C for 10 min. Transfer the supernatant to another tube and discard the pellet.\nAlternatively, triturate 75 mg of frozen tissues in liquid nitrogen. Then recover the tissue in 1 mL of lysis buffer.\nCentrifuge the sample in a microfuge at 15, 500 x g and 4 °C for 10 min. Transfer the supernatant to another tube and discard the pellet.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here, and samples stored at -80 °C until further analysis.\n3. Binding of GST-SUBEs or GST Control to Glutathione-Agarose Beads\nNOTE: The synthesis of the GST-SUBEs or GST control are outside the scope of this manuscript and can be reviewed in previously published literature20. Alternatively, GST- and Control SUBEs are commercially available (e.g., SignalChem).\nPreparation of glutathione beads\n\t\nAdd 1 mL of de-ionized water to 70 mg of lyophilized glutathione-agarose beads. Reconstitute the beads overnight at 4 °C (or for at least 30 min at room temperature).\nWash the beads thoroughly after swelling (to remove lactose and ethanol that are usually present in the lyophilized powder agarose beads). To do so, first wash with 10 mL of de-ionized water or PBS followed by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Perform this thrice.\nAfter 3 washes, resuspend the beads in 1 mL of PBS to obtain a 50% (v/v) slurry.\n\t\tNOTE: This volume is suitable for the analysis of 10 samples.\nFor each sample, add 100 μg of GST-SUBEs or GST control (see reference20) to 100 μL of the glutathione beads slurry and 500 µL of PBS.",
    "NOTE: The relative abundance of the SUMOylated proteins of interest determines the amount of GST-SUBEs used for pull-downs. For each new experimental model, analyze the condition prior to the actual experiment by western blotting the input, bound, and flow-through (FT) material using anti-SUMO2/3 antibodies or against proteins of interest (Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1).\nIncubate all the GST-SUBEs or GST control with beads prepared in 3.2., slowly rotating in rotator or mini roller (see Table of Materials) at 4 °C for at least 2 h (slow binding reaction).\n\tNOTE: Adding 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) improves GST binding to the glutathione beads.\nRecover the agarose beads by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature. At the end, resuspended the beads in PBS to obtain 50% (v/v) slurry.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here, and samples stored at -80 ˚C until further analysis.\n4. GST Pull Down Assay\nAfter step 1.5, 2.3 or 2.5, take 1/10 of total volume (e.g. 50 μL) and dilute in the same volume of 3x boiling buffer (250 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 500 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 50% glycerol, 10% SDS, bromophenol blue). This fraction is considered as INPUT.\nAdd 450 μL of clarified lysate from steps 1.5, 2.3 or 2.5 to 100 μL glutathione beads slurry. Incubate the lysate with beads, slowly rotating at 4 °C for at least 2 h.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, 100-200 μg of total protein from steps 1.5, 2.3 or 2.5 (quantified with the Bradford assay) in a total volume of 450 μL can be used.",
    "Spin down the beads in a microfuge at 300 x g for 5 min and collect the supernatant for the analysis. Transfer 1/10 of the total volume (e.g., 50 μL) in a separate tube and dilute in an equal volume of 3x boiling buffer. This fraction is the flow-through (FT) fraction.\nWash the remaining sample three times with 1 mL ice-cold PBS, 0.05% Tween 20, spin down at 4 °C and 300 x g for 1 min. Carefully aspirate ensuring no liquid remains. The beads correspond to SUBEs BOUND (SB) fraction.\nElute the sample with 15 μL of 3x boiling buffer and 15 μL of the lysis buffer. This is called the BOUND Fraction.\n5. Identification and Characterization of SUMO Targets by Western Blot analysis\nPerform western blot analysis using an anti-SUMO2/3 antibody or any other specific antibody of choice as described previously22.\n6. Identification and Characterization of the SUMOylated Proteome by Mass Spectrometry\nNOTE: In the case of Mass-Spectrometry (MS) analysis, samples were processed using the Filter-Aided Sample Preparation (FASP) method described by Wisniewski et al.23.\nDesalt the peptides by using stage-tip C18 microcolumns and resuspend them in 0.1% formic acid (FA) prior to MS analysis.\nLoad the samples onto a LC-MS system (see Table of Materials) and analyze them in triplicate (technical replicates) (Figure 2b).\nCarry on with the protein identification and abundance calculation by using an associated software.\nFor statistical analysis and heatmap generation, load the data onto the Perseus platform (http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/). Apply a permutation-based false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected t-test for the comparison of the abundances. Proteins with a q < 0.05 and a SUBEs/GST ratio greater than 2 were considered as enriched24.\n\tNOTE: Proteins identified with at least two different peptides are considered in the final analysis."
