    "This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital and University of South Carolina. TMA samples composed of breast cancer and matched adjacent normal breast tissues were provided by the Biobank of Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, a member of the Korea Biobank Network.\n1. Solution Preparation\nPrepare 1 L of DNase and RNase free water. Make all chemical solutions using diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water. Treat 1 L of water with 500 µl of DEPC and incubate for 3 hr at room temperature. Autoclave the water to inactivate DEPC.\n\tCaution: Do not inhale DEPC since it is known carcinogen.\nPrepare 1x PBS from 10x PBS using DEPC treated water.\nPrepare 20x SSC (dissolve 175.3 g of NaCl and 88.2 g of Sodium Citrate in 800 ml water, adjust the pH to 7.0 with a few drop of 14 N solution of HCl and adjust the volume to 1 L with water), 4% paraformaldehyde, 95% ethanol, 80% ethanol using DEPC treated water.\nAdd 8 ml of triethanolamine and 1.05 ml of HCl in 590 ml of DEPC-treated water and add 1.5 ml of acetic anhydride for acetylation.\nPrepare 50 µg/µl proteinase K in buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 in DEPC treated water).\nPrepare hybridization buffer composed of 500 µl of formamide, 250 µl of 20x SSC, 100 µl of 50x Denhardt's solution, 12.5 µl of t-RNA, 2.5 µl of herring sperm DNA, 30 µl of RVC, 0.02 g of blocking reagent and 50 µl of DEPC water. Prepare fresh.\n2. Breast Tissue Sections\nCut 5 µm formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections with microtome and apply the section to charge slide14.\n\tNote: The breast tissue used here was prepared previously from the Korea Biobank Network.\n3. Tissue Preparation",
    "Remove paraffin from the tissue by immersing slides into Coplin jar 2x in fresh xylene for 10 min each and rehydrate the tissue section by 5 min incubations in decreasing concentrations of ethanol (100%, 95% and 80%) in ddH2O. Perform this step in a fume hood.\nImmerse the tissue in DEPC treated water for 5 min. At this point make boundaries around tissue section with hydrophobic barrier pen.\nFix the tissue with 4% PFA for 15 min followed by a wash with PBS.\nImmerse the tissue in 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 min followed by a wash with PBS.\nIncubate sample with 50 µg/µl Proteinase K solution for 15 min at 37 °C. Then incubate tissue sections with triethanolamine and acetic anhydride for 5 min at room temperature, followed by a wash with PBS. No PBS wash is required between Proteinase K treatment and triethanolamine/acetic anhydride treatment.\n4. Hybridization\nWash the tissue thoroughly and incubate the tissue section with hybridization buffer for 2 to 3 hr at room temperature. Typically 120 µl hybridization buffer is enough to cover the tissue section.\nDilute 5'-DIG labelled LNA probe to final concentration of 3 pM in 120 µl hybridization solution. As the stock concentration usually is 40 ng/µl, add 3 µl of stock to 120 µl hybridization buffer and incubate mixture at 95 °C for 5 min.\nIncubate tissue section with probe overnight at 54 °C (Tm) in a humid chamber. Typically 120 µl is enough to cover one section. Create humidity by using two wet paper towels. The ideal size of chamber is 10 inches by 8 inches.\nNote: Tm may be different for different miRNA. 54 °C is mention for miR-489.\n5. Stringency Wash",
    "Wash the tissue with 5x SSC for 7 min (after the hybridization step, RNase free conditions are no longer required).\nWash the tissue section with 1x SSC for 7 min twice at 57 °C.\nWash the tissue section with 0.2x SSC for 7 min at 57 °C.\nWash the tissue section with 0.2x SSC for 7 min at room temperature.\nIncubate tissue section in PBS for 10 min.\n6. Blocking\nIncubate the tissue section with blocking buffer at room temperature for 1 hr in a humid chamber (To make blocking buffer add 2 ml FBS, 10 µl of Tween-20 and 3 µl of BSA in 18 m of PBS. Store blocking buffer at 4 °C).\n7. Primary Antibody Incubation and Development\nDilute 1:300 anti-DIG-AP antibody in blocking buffer and incubate the tissue section with antibody at 4 °C overnight.\nWash the sections with wash buffer 3 times, for 5 min each (buffer provided by development kit).\nDevelop the tissue section with a commercial kit for alkaline phosphatase that produces CY-3 florescent light.\nWash the section with wash buffer for 5 min. Stain section with 100 µl of 2.5 ng/µl Hoechst dye for 5 min followed by a 5 min wash with wash buffer.\nMount the section with mounting buffer according to manufacturer's protocol. Use 15 µl per tissue section and wipe excessive mounting solution with tissue wipe. Seal the slide with clear nail polish to prevent leaking.\nObserve the section florescent microscope using with 10X lens so total magnification is 100X.\nSubscription Required.
