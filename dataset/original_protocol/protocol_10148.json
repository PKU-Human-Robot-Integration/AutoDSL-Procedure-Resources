    "1. Preparation of Tissue Culture Media\nUse a 0.5 L bottle of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/L glucose, sodium bicarbonate, and L-glutamine as the base for the culture media.\nIn a sterile laminar flow hood, add 10 mL of antibiotics to the 0.5 L of DMEM.\nUsing a sterile pipette, transfer 50 mL of the DMEM antibiotics solution to a sterile 50 mL conical tube.\nAdd 50 mL of chick serum to the remaining DMEM antibiotics solution in the 0.5 L bottle in the sterile hood.\nStore the final solution (referred to hereafter as chick culture media [CCM]) in 50 mL conical tube aliquots at -20 °C.\n2. Egg Incubation\nUse delicate wipes with 70% ethanol to clean fertilized specific pathogen-free White Leghorn chicken eggs. Arrange eggs in a longitudinal orientation on holders.\nTurn on an egg incubator to set a target temperature of 37.5 °C and maintain the humidity at 48 - 55%. The humidity is controlled by adding an appropriate amount of water to the incubator.\nIncubate the eggs to HH11-13, approximately 40 - 44 h.\nLet the eggs cool down at room temperature for approximately 15 - 30 min prior to spraying/cleaning with 70% ethanol.\n3. Pull Glass Capillaries\nMount a 10 cm-long glass capillary tubes with an outer diameter of 1.0 mm and an inner diameter of 0.5 mm on a micropipette puller.\nSet the heat and pull parameters to 750 and 400, respectively. Press the pull button to pull the capillary tube into thin needles.\n4. Filter Paper Carrier Method\nCut circles of approximately 3 cm in diameter from filter paper.\nCut a rectangle roughly 1 cm by 2 cm from the circle using a hole puncher. Make sure to remove any protruding or sharp corners.\n5. Embryo Harvesting and Preparation",
    "Crack eggs from the bottom, pull apart the shell gently and carefully deposit contents into a 150 mm x 15 mm petri dish. To ensure the embryo side is up, keep the eggs in the same orientation they were incubated while cracking them.\nRemove the thin albumin using a disposable Pasteur pipette.\nSeparate the thick albumin from the yolk using blunt ended forceps. Ensure that the thick albumin has been removed by lightly scraping the top of the yolk with the blunt ended forceps.\nUse fine-tipped forceps to center and place a filter paper ring over the embryo, matching the long axis of the ring with the long axis of the embryo.\nCut the yolk surrounding the filter paper ring with scissors.\nPull the ring and embryo off the yolk in an oblique direction towards the site where the yolk was first cut.\nRinse the embryos in two sequential 100-mm dishes with room temperature 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nPlace a filter paper ring into a 35-mm petri dish first. Then place the embryo dorsal side up onto the filter paper already in 35-mm petri dish.\nPlace a stainless-steel ring on top of the filter paper sandwich. Make sure not to damage the embryo.\nAdd 3 mL of the previously prepared CCM to each petri dish.\nRemove the VM of each embryo by lightly skimming the pulled capillary needle across the top of the embryo and peeling the VM away, starting from the anterior end (right above the forebrain) and proceeding to the notochord (Figure 1A).\nPlace eight 35-mm Petri dishes into one 150 mm dish that was lined with water saturated delicate task wipes (to maintain humidity).",
    "Place the 150-mm petri dish into a sealable plastic bag then fill the bag with a gas mixture comprised of 95% O2 and 5% CO2.\nSeal the bag and place it in a 37.5 °C incubator.\nIncubate the embryos for an additional 27 h until HH15-HH16 (Figure 1B).\n6. Inducing Surface Tension\nRemove the embryos from the incubator and use an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system to image them. Use OCT to determine the torsional angle of the neural tube (NT) (Figure 2).\nTransfer the embryos to a light microscope and visualize at 10X magnification. Use a 200 microliter pipette to incrementally remove 0.2 mL of media from the petri dish.\nTake brightfield images at each interval to observe the effects of the media-air interface on the embryo.\nRemove media until the surface tension across the embryo induces torsion (Figure 1C).\nImage the embryo using the OCT system once again to establish a final torsional angle for comparison to control embryos.  NOTE: The Bright-field images were acquired by using a dissecting microscope. An optical coherence tomography system with an attached microscope was used to acquire cross-sectional image stacks of live embryos. Images were obtained in a 3 x 10 mm x 3 mm3 scanning domain, then processed in an imaging software. Lastly, the physical model images were taken with a digital single-lens reflex camera.\n7. Physical Modeling of Surface Tension/VM Forces\nDevelop a simplified 3D geometry that resembles an embryo between HH14-17 in commercial modeling software (Figure 3A).\nDesign the negative mold of the 3D geometry in commercial 3D computer graphics software.\nUse a 3D printer loaded with 1.75 mm acrylonitrile butadiene styrene filament to 3D print the designed mold, in stereolithographic (.stl) format.",
    "To cast the mold, mix silicone rubber elastomer components A and B in equal parts and pour the mix into the mold promptly; set the casting mold to cure at room temperature for 12 h (Figure 3B).\nMark the physical model of the embryo along the NT on the dorsal side to visualize torsion.\nUse a coverslip to replicate the force applied to the 3D physical model which mimics that of the VM or surface tension (Figure 3D).\nInsert a series of rigid wires of equal length to the side of the physical model. After the coverslip exerts an external force on the brain model, the wires become tilted at an angle that depends on the location. Determine the rotational angle by arctan of the projected length over the original length of each wire (Figure 3E).\n8. Altering the Direction of the Heart Loop\nFollow the steps in 3.1 and 3.2 to obtain a pulled capillary tube.\nFollow the steps in 5.1 through 5.10 to prepare the embryo.\nUse a pair of forceps to flip the filter paper so that the embryo becomes ventral-side-up.\nUse the pulled capillary tube to cut open a slit in the splanchnopleure (SPL) membrane.\nUse the capillary tube to exert a mechanical force to push the heart from the right-hand side to the left-hand side.\nFollow the steps in 5.12 through 5.15 to observe the change in torsion.\nSubscription Required.
