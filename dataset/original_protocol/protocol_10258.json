    "1. Preparation of Silicon Primary Mold\nNOTE: A photomask is required for the preparation of the primary mold. The photomask can be either purchased from independent providers or fabricated in-house through standard optical mask fabrication procedures. A photomask with bright field polarity is used in this case (Figure 2a).\nPattern definition\nSpin coat a 4 inch silicon wafer with SU-8 3010 negative photoresist at 2,300 rpm for 30 s.\nSoft-bake the photoresist on a hot plate at 65 °C for 2 min and then at 95 °C for 8 min.\nExpose the photoresist to UV light (i-line, 365 nm) through the photomask under the mask aligner for a total energy dose of 100-120 mJ/cm2; the hard contact mode is preferred to achieve a better resolution.\nRemove the wafer and apply a post exposure bake at 65 °C for 1 min and then at 95 °C for 2 min.\nDevelop the photoresist using a SU-8 developer at room temperature, then rinse with isopropyl alcohol, and gently blow dry with nitrogen; the measured pattern thickness should be 10 µm and below. See Figure 2b for the picture of the actual silicon mold.\nSilanization of silicon mold\nTreat the silicon mold with oxygen plasma at 60 W for 30 s with 20 sccm of oxygen flow. Set the chamber pressure to 1-10 mbar during the process.\nPlace the mold in a vacuum jar with 50 µL of silane and leave the jar in the vacuum state (1-10 mbar) for at least 2 h.",
    "NOTE: The silanization process creates a hydrophobic surface coating which prevents PDMS from sticking to the mold15. Note that the primary mold can also be fabricated using an alternative method, which involves dry etching of the silicon. In this case, the photomask will be of opposite polarity (dark field), and the pattern definition in step 1.1 will use a positive photoresist.\n2. Preparation of PDMS Secondary Mold\nPDMS mixing\nMix the PDMS elastomer and curing agent, 10:1; the total amount is such that the resulting PDMS thickness is approximately 1 to 1.5 mm.\nAfter thorough mixing, degas the mixture by leaving it in a vacuum jar in the vacuum state (1-10 mbar) for approximately 15 min or until there are no visible bubbles; this is to remove any trapped air within the mixture.\nMold replication\nPour the PDMS mixture on the silicon mold fabricated in step 1 and degas the mixture to remove any trapped air with the same settings as in step 2.1.2. Heat at 70 °C for 2 h on a hot plate to cure the mixture.\nRemove the cured PDMS from the hot plate and let it cool down to room temperature. With a razor blade, cut the PDMS along the edges of the silicon mold.\nWith a pair of tweezers, pinch one corner of the cut PDMS and carefully peel the PDMS replica off the silicon mold; the resulting microfluidic pattern on this secondary mold is a protrusion, which is the opposite polarity of the primary mold (Figure 2c).\nSilanization of the PDMS replica (same as in step 1.2)\nTreat the PDMS mold with oxygen plasma at 60 W for 30 s with 20 sccm of oxygen flow. Set the chamber pressure to 1-10 mbar during the process.",
    "Place the mold in a vacuum jar with 50 µL of silane and leave the jar in the vacuum state (1-10 mbar) for at least 2 h.\n3. Preparation of PDMS Templates\nNOTE: To standardize the shape and size of the final devices and to ease the alignment of the main features in the two halves, two separate PDMS templates were used, which define the geometry of the device, the placement of the transparent window and the in- and out-let connections. The first PDMS template aids the fabrication of the patterned half of the device, while the second helps to ease the fabrication of the flat half of the device.\nDesign the templates using a computer aided design (CAD) software. Figure 3a shows the lay-out and dimensions of the template used to fabricate the patterned half of the device. To fabricate the flat half of the device, remove the 1.5 mm diameter holes from the design.\nAcquire the templates from an external provider or through an internal mechanical workshop if available.\n\tNOTE: Acrylic was used as the template material due to ease of fabrication and low cost achievable in any standard workshop. There are alternative options, such as 3D printing.\nMix the PDMS elastomer and curing agent 10:1; be sure to prepare a sufficient amount of PDMS to entirely submerge the templates.\nAfter thorough mixing, degas the mixture by leaving it in a vacuum jar in the vacuum state (1-10 mbar) for approximately 15 min or until there are no visible bubbles (whichever is later); this is to remove any trapped air within the mixture.",
    "Pour the PDMS mixture on the acrylic templates until their top-most surface is submerged about 1 mm below the liquid surface. Degas the PDMS again to remove any trapped air with the same settings as in 3.4. Heat this at 60 °C for 2 h on a leveled hot plate to cure the mixture.\nRemove the cured PDMS from the hot plate and let it cool down to room temperature. With a razor blade, cut the PDMS along the edges of the acrylic templates.\nWith a pair of tweezers, pinch one corner of the cut PDMS and carefully peel the PDMS off the acrylic templates.\n\tNOTE: Figure 3b shows the lay-out and dimensions of the PDMS replica used to fabricate the patterned half of the device.\nPrepare the second PDMS replica for fabricating the flat half of the device by repeating steps 3.3 to 3.7 but using the acrylic template without the 1.5 mm diameter holes.\n4. Microfluidic Device Fabrication\nFabrication of the patterned half of the device (i.e. , with device layout)\nTreat the CaF2 window with oxygen plasma at 60 W for 30 s with 20 sccm of oxygen flow. This is done to improve the flow of NOA during the following fabrication.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is not mandatory.\nPlace carefully the first PDMS template (one with the 1.5 mm diameter pillars) on a flat surface, e.g., a soda lime plate (Figure 4a). Place a CaF2 window centered on top of the PDMS plug and gently press the window such that it is in good contact with the plug (Figure 4b).",
    "Take the PDMS mold made in step 2 and place a thin UV-transparent plate (in this case, a quartz plate, 500 µm thick and 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm in size) on the backside of the mold, aligned with the location of the central chamber (Figure 4c). Make sure that the quartz plate is in good contact with the PDMS mold.\n\t\tNOTE: The quartz plate prevents the unwanted area of the mold from easily coming into contact with the CaF2 window.\nGently place this PDMS mold face down towards the CaF2 window with the fluidic chamber aligned to the center of the CaF2 window. Make sure that all the elements (template, mold and window) are in good contact and aligned (Figure 4c-4d).\nGradually dispense drops of NOA at the in-let of the PDMS template and let it slowly fill the cavity. Once the resin comes into contact with the edge of the window, the capillary flow will fill the thin gap (~10 µm) between the PDMS mold and CaF2 window (Figure 4e-4f).\nAfter the cavity is completely filled, cure the NOA by exposure to UV light (e.g., with a UV-LED exposure system, Figure 4g).\n\t\tNOTE: The exposure time may vary accordingly with the energy of the UV source. The UV-LED exposure system, which provides a power density of 24 mW/cm2, requires around 90 s at 100% power and continuous exposure mode.\nCarefully remove the thin quartz plate from the back of the PDMS mold and then gently peel the PDMS mold from the top of the NOA layer (Figure 4h). Finally, remove the NOA layer from the PDMS template (Figure 4i).\n\t\tNOTE: The resulting device layout on the cured NOA would have the same polarity of the pattern in the primary silicon mold.",
    "Fabrication of the flat half of the device (i.e. , without device layout)\nTreat the CaF2 window with oxygen plasma at 60 W for 30 s with 20 sccm of oxygen flow.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is not mandatory.\nPlace carefully the second PDMS template (one without the 1.5 mm diameter pillars) on a flat surface, e.g., a soda lime plate. Place a CaF2 window centered on top of the PDMS plug and gently press the window such that it is in good contact with the plug.\nPlace a 1 mm thick PDMS sheet with 5 cm x 3.5 cm size on top of the CaF2 window, with the PDMS sheet aligned with the center of the PDMS template. Make sure that the PDMS sheet is in good contact with the window.\nGradually dispense drops of NOA at the in-let of the PDMS template and let it slowly fill the cavity.\nAfter the cavity is completely filled, cure the NOA by exposure to UV light (e.g., with a UV-LED exposure system).\n\t\tNOTE: The exposure time may vary accordingly with the UV energy source. With the UV-LED exposure system, which provides a power density of 24 mW/cm2, this requires around 50 s at 100% power and continuous exposure mode.\nPeel off the PDMS sheet from the top of the NOA layer and carefully remove the cured NOA layer from the PDMS template.\nBonding of the two halves of the device\nAlign the two halves of the device such that both CaF2 windows are aligned. Gently finger-press both halves at the corner of the NOA layers such that the position of the two halves are fixed.\nCut two circular discs out of a 1 mm thick PDMS sheet using an 8 mm diameter puncher (Figure 5a).",
    "Cut two rectangles with the same size of the device (4 cm x 2.5 cm) from a 1 mm thick PDMS sheet. On both PDMS rectangles, cut openings corresponding to the channels and the in-let/out-let of the device.\n\t\tNOTE: The pre-cut openings in the PDMS rectangles are meant to prevent the channels from collapsing during pressing.\nStack in the following order from the bottom: one PDMS rectangle with pre-cut openings, one PDMS disc (in contact with the bottom window, cut in step 4.3.2), the two finger-pressed halves of the device, the second PDMS disc (sitting on the top window), and lastly the second PDMS rectangle with pre-cut openings (Figure 5b).\nPlace this assembly in the vacuum press setup such that it is sandwiched between 2 plates and seal the plastic bag (Figure 5c). Turn on the vacuum pump and evacuate the assembly. Let the vacuum pump reach its base pressure or apply the vacuum for at least 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The base pressure achieved depends on the vacuum pump used and quality of the sealing of the plastic bag.\nExpose the evacuated assembly to UV with a broad-band Hg gas lamp at 270 W for 15 min. Turn off the vacuum pump and let the assembly slowly vent to atmospheric pressure before removing the final device from the assembly.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
