    "Localisation of NO and ROS by DAF and DCF fluorescenceSurface sterilize seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (Col-0) by incubating seeds in 10% NaOCl and 0.1% Tween-20 detergent for 10 min and washed three times with autoclaved distilled water.Transfer the sterilised seeds horizontally on Murashige Skoog (MS medium) 1.5% agar plates, close the plates with micropore tape and culture for 12 days under long day conditions . Grow Trichoderma asperelloides (T. asperelloides) T203 and Fusarium oxysporum (F. oxysporum) f. sp. lentis on potato dextrose agar (PDA; 39 g/L) plates for 10 days at 28 °C.Harvest T203 conidia by gentle scraping the petridish in 5 ml sterile water, consisting of both mycelium and spores, and add the solution (that contain mycelium+spores) to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube in which the plant intact root system has to be placed (shown in Figure 1).The following treatments are recommended:Untreated plants (control).Incubate with T. asperelloides for various time intervals as described by Gupta et al. (2014).Incubate F. oxysporum-for 10 min to 4 h depending on experiment.Incubate plants simultaneously with T. asperelloides sand F. oxysporum. Once the fungal incubation is finished remove plant from microcentrifuge and wash three times with HEPES buffer.Incubate the whole plant with 10 µM DAF-2DA or DCF-2DA (2 ml volume) for 10 min in dark (Figure 1).Wash excess of DAF or DCF-2DA dye three times with HEPES buffer.Observe roots under bright field mode and capture picture.The observe fluorescence emission using a 505- to 530-nm band-excitation filter coupled with a 515-nm long-emission filter.Quantify images using Image J software by selecting area of interest and go to menu under Image J and click for analyse and then click submenu to measure.",
    "Determination of NO by gas phase griess reagent assayPlace 1 g of root material in a 10 ml small conical flask that contain 4 ml of HEPES buffer (Figure 1).Take a loop-full of inoculum, that contains both mycelium and spores, and add to a conical flask.The following treatments are recommended.Untreated plants (control).Incubate with T. asperelloides for various intervals.Incubate F. oxysporum-for various Intervals Figure 1.Incubate plants simultaneously with T. asperelloides and F. oxysporum.Flush the solution in conical flask with NO free air (It is a safe process) (shown in Figure 1B).Trap the emitted air (bubbling) containing NO into 2 ml solution containing 1 ml of 1% w/v sulphanilamide and 0.02% w/v N-(1)-(naphthyl) ethylene-diaminedihydrochloride (Greiss reagent) (shown in Figure 1B).Read the absorbance at 540 nm in spectrophotometer.Make a standard curve with 0.1 to 5 µM nitrite.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141001/20141001071206_4673.jpgFigure1. A. NO and ROS detection by DAF and DCF2DA fluorescence; Roots were incubated in the solution containing fungus+spores and then transferred to DAF or DCF solution and monitored fluorescence B. Detection of NO released into gas phase detected by Griess reagent assay. 1 g of roots were placed in conical flask containing 4 ml of HEPES (pH 7.6) and flushed with NO free air and then NO generated from roots in response to fungal infection was trapped in griess reagent."
