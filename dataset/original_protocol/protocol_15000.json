    "1. Culturing HUVECs on Microslides for Observing CTC-endothelial Interactions\nUnder the tissue culture hood, first rinse the microslide, channel width of 1 mm with PBS. Gently coat the microslide with 200 µl of 50 µg/ml fibronectin (dissolved in PBS) using a 1-ml Luer-lock syringe.\nCover the microslide with the lid and keep it inside the tissue culture hood for 30 min. Slow dispensing of the liquid in the microslide prevents bubble formation in the channel.\nPerfuse 200 µl of warm (37 °C) HUVEC growth medium (M199 media, 1M HEPES, 20% FBS, 5 mg/ml heparin, 100 µg/ml endothelial cell growth factor, and L-glutamine) over the microslide and incubate for 20 min at RT. During the perfusion, prepare HUVEC cell suspension.\nRinse HUVECs with PBS and add 0.05% trypsin-EDTA for 1-2 min at RT. Centrifuge HUVECs in 2 ml growth medium at 180 x g for 5 min.\nMeasure the cell concentration using a neubauer hemocytometer and prepare 107 HUVEC cells/100 µl growth medium. Then, carefully remove the medium from the inlet of the microslide using a 200-µl pipette tip.\nBring the microslide to eye level and using a 1-ml Luer-lock syringe, gently perfuse 200 µl of prepared concentration of HUVECs into the channel. Caution is required at this step to prevent bubble formation. If the bubbles appear, keep perfusing for a slightly longer time until bubbles enter the outlet channel.\nPut an equal volume (~80 µl) of HUVEC media in both the inlet and outlet of the microslide. This prevents the flow of cells in either direction.\nCover the slide and keep it in the incubator (37 °C) for 1.5 hr.\n2. Preparation of Flow Chamber Assembly for Overnight HUVEC Culture on a Microslide",
    "Place a sterile 20-ml syringe, female and male Luer connectors, tubing, and a syringe pump in the incubator for 15 min.\nFor minimal dead volume, use the tubing with inner diameter of 0.04 inches. Smaller tubing diameter prevents bubble formation.\nFill the 20-ml syringe with warm (37 °C) HUVEC media (12 ml). Attach the tubing with the connectors onto the syringe. Remove the bubbles. Connect this assembly to the microslide.\nCompletely fill the inlet of the microslide with HUVEC media. Bring the filled 20-ml syringe attached to the connector next to the microslide. Gently attach the connector to the microslide.\nBring the set-up into the incubator and connect it to the syringe pump, set at 10 µl/min shear rate. Leave the cells O/N in the incubator at 37 °C.\nNext day, disassemble the set-up by removing the connector attached to the inlet of the microslide.\nTo upregulate E-selectin expression on ECs, prepare fresh growth medium containing IL-1β at 10 ng/ml in 4 ml media. Aspirate the media in a 10-ml syringe. Remove the media from the inlet of the microslide and connect the syringe to the slide.\nSet the syringe pump at 10 µl/min shear rate for 4 hr in the incubator.\n3. Preparation of Anti-PSMA (J591-488) Labeled Prostate Cancer Cells\nDuring IL-1β incubation of HUVECs, prepare anti-PSMA J591-alexa488 labeled PCa cells. Add 0.05% trypsin-EDTA to MDA cells for 1 min. Do not expose the cells to trypsin for longer times as it can affect the glycopeptides present on the cell surface. Enzyme free cell dissociation reagent can also be used instead of trypsin. Centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min.",
    "Resuspend MDA cell pellet in 1 ml H/H buffer (Hanks balanced salt solution/0.1% HSA/10 mM HEPES/1 mM CaCl2). Add anti-PSMA J591-alexa488 antibody at 20 µg/ml for 30 min at RT in a dark place. Resuspend the cells during the incubation.\nAfter 30 min, centrifuge the cell solution at 800 x g for 5 min. Aspirate and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml H/H buffer. Count the labeled MDA cells and bring the final concentration to 1x106 cells/ml. Fill a 5-ml syringe with J591-488 labeled MDA cells and remove the bubbles.\n4. Preparation of Anti-PSMA (J591-488) Labeled CTCs Enriched from PCa Patients\nCollect 7.5 ml blood from prostate cancer patients in a blue cap tube (containing sodium citrate). Gently dilute blood 1:1 in 0.1% BSA/1 mM EDTA/PBS.\nAdd 5.3 ml Ficoll-paque plus in a 50-ml conical tube. Layer diluted blood on top of the ficoll-paque. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 30 min.\nPre-coat all the tubes or tips coming in contact with CTCs with 2% FBS/RPMI-1640/ 1 mM CaCl2/ 4 mM MgCl2 (R/S buffer) to prevent non-specific binding of CTCs to the surfaces. Maintain 4 °C temperature of media and buffers coming in contact with CTCs.\nCollect the peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) fraction containing CTCs from the interface in another 50-ml conical tube containing 30 ml R/S buffer. Centrifuge at 400 x g for 8 min.\nResuspend the pellet and wash again in R/S buffer at 400 x g for 8 min. After centrifugation, resuspend the pellet in H/H buffer. Add anti-PSMA J591-488 antibody at 20 µg/ml for 30 min at RT in a dark place.\nAfter 30 min, centrifuge the PBMCs containing J591-488 labeled CTCs at 800 x g for 5 min. Resuspend in H/H buffer. Fill a 1-ml syringe (pre-coated with R/S buffer) with the sample.",
    "5. Preparation of Microscope, Syringe Pump and Flow Chamber Assembly\nTurn on the inverted microscope and set the Kohler illumination at 10X objective. Bring the syringe pump at the same level as the sample stage of the microscope and set it at 1 dyn/cm2 shear stress (~ 10 µl/min).\nOpen the Zeiss Axiovision software. Select the objective on the computer screen. Create a new folder under the tools option in the software.\nOpen the smart experiments option in Axiovision and adjust the settings to record short 30 sec videos for 30 min.\nFor live fluorescent video, set the image options- 12 msec Exposure, 2 x 2 bin, 5 Gain. These parameters help in attaining videos close to the video frame rate (~ 23 frames per sec) with the Zeiss mRm camera.\nTo visualize full width of the flow channel at 10 X objective on the computer screen, use a C-mount adapter (0.63 x f/60 mm Interface).\nSwitch on the mercury lamp.\nPlace the syringe and the connector containing the cells onto the syringe pump.\nBring IL-1β stimulated HUVECs from the incubator. Attach the connector to the filled inlet channel of the microslide containing HUVECs.\nConnect the outlet channel with the connector attached to the tubing. Put the tubing into a dish or 15 ml conical tube to collect the flow through.\nStart the infusion through the microslide at 10 µl/min. Observe the interactions between endothelial cells and labeled MDA cells or labeled CTCs derived from patients under 488-nm filter on the epifluorescence microscope.\nStart recording the experiment as 30 sec short videos. During playback analysis, measure the rolling velocity. Rolling velocity is measured by dividing the distance traveled by the cells over time.\n6. Immunostaining of the Microslide",
    "Remove the media from the inlet and outlet of the microslide after perfusing MDA cells on IL-1β-stimulated HUVECs for 10 min.\nUsing a 200-µl tip, put warm (37 °C) PBS containing calcium and magnesium into the inlet of the microslide for 5 min. Tilt the microslide using its lid as a prop on the bench. Keep the microslide in a tilted position for all the incubations during immunostaining.\nFix HUVECs by perfusing warm 2% formaldehyde into the inlet\nIncubate for 20 min at RT. Rinse twice with PBS for 5 min each.\nAdd triton-X 100 (0.1%) in 5% BSA in PBS for 10 min at RT.\nRinse twice with PBS for 5 min each. Block with 5% BSA in PBS for 30 min.\nIncubate with primary antibody goat anti-VE-Cadherin (1:100) in 2.5% BSA O/N at 4 °C.\nNext day, wash twice with PBS for 5 min each. Add secondary donkey anti-goat 647 antibody for 45 min. Wash twice with PBS for 5 min each.\nIncubate at RT with humanized J591-alexa488 conjugated antibody for 1 hr.\nWash twice with PBS for 5 min each. Add DAPI for 5 min. Wash with distilled water for 5 min.\nAdd PBS (or mowiol for long-term storage). Visualize the microslide under the confocal microscope.\nSubscription Required.
