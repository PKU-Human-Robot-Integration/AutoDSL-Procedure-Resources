    "All applicable international, national, and/or institutional guidelines for the care and use of animals were followed. The protocol was approved by local authorities at the Regierung von Unterfranken, Wuerzburg, Germany.\n1. Tissue Processing and Immunohistochemistry\nEuthanize mice with CO2 or any other approved method.\nPerfuse six 12-week-old C56Bl/6N male mice transcardially with 10 mL of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using a 25-G needle and an infusion pump, followed by 70 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M PBS.\nCAUTION: PFA is toxic, allergenic, and carcinogenic.\nDissect the mouse brain in the coronal plane with a brain matrix slicer at the region of +0.74 mm from Bregma (Figure 25, Paxinos and Franklin mouse brain atlas14).\nPut the dorsal part of the brain, including the SN, in 4% PFA in 0.1 M PBS for 1 d at 4 °C for immersion-fixation.\nExchange the PFA for 30% sucrose/0.1 mol PBS solution for cryo-protection and incubate for another 2 d at 4 °C.\nPut the dorsal part of the brain into a cryomold filled with optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound and slowly freeze the tissue in liquid dry ice-cooled isopentane.\nCAUTION: Dry ice is extremely cold (-78 °C); use personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves, while working with dry ice. Dry ice evaporates in CO2; therefore, work under a fume hood.\nSerially cut 30-µm cryo-sections in the coronal plane and collect the sections, starting at 2.46 mm from Bregma (Figure 51, Paxinos and Franklin mouse brain atlas14) and ending at 4.04 mm from Bregma (Figure 64, Paxinos and Franklin mouse brain atlas14).\nStore four series in tubes that are filled with cryoprotectant (30% glycerol, 30% ethoxyethanol, and 40% PBS) at -20 °C. During the sectioning procedure, mark the right hemisphere by puncturing a small hole into the upper region of the brainstem.",
    "For immunohistochemical staining, select one series of sections per mouse. Preincubate free-floating sections for 1 h in 10% normal goat serum (NGS)/2% BSA/0.5% detergent in 0.1 mol PBS on a shaker. Incubate the sections with rabbit anti-mouse tyrosine hydroxylase (TH; 1:1,000 dilution) antibody diluted in 2% NGS/2% BSA/0.5% detergent in 0.1 mol PBS overnight at 4 °C.\nApply secondary antibodies against rabbit Igs (1:100 dilution) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by avidin/biotin reagent (1:100 dilution). Incubate and stain with 3,3-diaminobenzidine-tetrahydrochloride (DAB) and H2O2. Mount the sections after staining them on coated object slides.\n\tNOTE: TH+ dopaminergic SN neurons are shown in Figure 1a. By staining one series, an average of 13 SN sections, extending from the rostral to caudal portions of the SN pars compacta (SNpc) and reticulata, are stained per animal (Figure 1b). The sections are separated by 120 µm (1/4 series) (Figure 1c).\nCAUTION: DAB is a suspected carcinogen. It is toxic by contact and inhalation. Use PPE when working with DAB.\n2. Acquisition of Images\nCapture TH immunohistochemically stained SN sections digitally using imaging software that is coupled to a microscope. Separately analyze each section of one series.\nUse the scan slide option of the imaging software. Save in TIFF format for high-quality images (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Image resolution is 312 pixels per cm.\nPress \"Acquire\" to open the acquisition window (Figure 2a).\nSet the binning to \"2\" for grayscale images.\n\tNOTE: The acquisition of grayscale images instead of color pictures reduces the size of the final stack image file (Figure 2a).\nClick on \"Show Live\" in the acquisition window to open a new window showing the live image of the section (Figure 2a and b).",
    "Click on \"Stage\" in the acquisition window. Choose \"Scan Slide\" in the dropdown menu and check the box (Figure 2c).\n\tNOTE: This enables the acquisition and alignment of highly magnified SN images (630X magnification) in the x,y-plane, as well as the acquisition of stack images with a distance between consecutive images of 1 µm in the z-plane, covering a total range of 13 µm.\nSelect the 2.5X objective to search for the SN.\nChange the objective to 63x.\nDefine the upper left corner (TopLeft) (Figure 2c) and lower right corner (LowRight) (Figure 2d) of the section by clicking on \"Set.\"\nClick on \"Z-Series\" and check the \"Z-Plane series\" box (Figure 2e).\nDetermine the actual mounted thickness of the sections at three randomly selected counting sites per section using the imaging software. For this, click on \"View Top Offset\" to define the top of the section (Figure 2e) and then click on \"Stop View Top\" (Figure 2f). Thereafter, click on \"View Bottom Offset\" (Figure 2f) and then click on \"Stop View Bottom\" (Figure 2g). Write down the thickness of the section.\nSubtract 3 µm (guard zone) from the top offset and type the result into the top offset slot (Figure 2h). Subtract 13 µm (height of the optical disector) from the top offset number and type the result into the bottom offset slot (Figure 2i). Select the following parameters: steps, 14; size, 1.00 (Figure 2i).\n\tNOTE: This corresponds to a thickness in the z-plane of 13 µm, with a 1-µm distance between consecutive images.\nSelect the directory to save the file (Figure 2j).\nClick on \"Sequence\" to start the acquisition (Figure 2j).",
    "Click on \"Processing\" and select the following parameters: \"All Planes,\" from \"Sequence;\" \"Montage;\" and the \"Fast\" and \"Stitching\" boxes, with an image overlap of 10% (Figure 2k). Start to stitch the images by clicking on \"start\".\n\tNOTE: This will generate stack images for analysis (Figure 2l, Figure 3a-e).\n3. Sequence of Stereological Assessment\nPerform the analysis of SN stack images using the NIH ImageJ software version 4.7.\nDownload the two plugins that are needed from the ImageJ.nih.gov website: the \"Grid Overlay\" plugin15 and the \"Cell Counter\" plugin16. Install both plugins as described.\nFor unbiased stereological assessment, define the counting parameters as follows: grid size, 130 x 130 µm; counting frame, 50 x 50 µm; and optical disector height, 13 µm.\nOpen the image by clicking on \"File\" → \"Open\" (Figure 4a) Set the image scale by using the \"Analyze\" → \"Set Scale\" command (Figure 4b). For this step, change the defined size from pixels to µm (Figure 4c).\n\tNOTE: For the analyzed images, 425 pixels corresponds to 100 µm.\nSelect the \"Plugins\" → \"Grid\" → \"Grid Type: Lines\" command to randomly insert a grid. Check the \"Random Offset\" box. Define the size of one square within the grid (grid-square) as 130 µm x 130 µm = 16,900 µm2 (Figure 3b and Figure 4d and e).\nChange image type from 16-bit to RGB Color (Click on \"Image\" → \"Type\" → \"RGB Color\") (Figure 4f). Locate the SNpc, as described by Baquet et al.17. Encircle the SNpc with the \"Paintbrush Tool\" (brush width: 11) (Figure 3c and Figure 4g-i).\nUndo the \"Set Scale\" command by clicking \"Analyze\" → \"Set Scale\" → \"Click to Remove Scale\" (Figure 4j-l) to enable the performance of the calculations in pixels rather than µm.",
    "Make a screenshot (Figure 4m), save the image file, and open the new file with ImageJ (Figure 4n). Select \"Point\" (Figure 4o) and a brush width of 25 (Figure 4p). Mark every grid-square that contacts the SN for placement of an optical disector (Figure 4q). Perform analysis of the cell number in all optical disectors that are localized fully or partially within the outlined SN.\nSelect one grid-square that includes parts of the SN. Measure the upper left corner of this square with the cursor in ImageJ to define the x and y coordinates to start with (Figure 4r).\n\tNOTE: Coordinates will be inserted for optical disector positioning using the \"optical disector position\" (Figure 4s), as described in step 4.\nCalculate the optical disector position by using the spreadsheet template entitled, \"Optical disector position,\" as described in step 4.\nCalibrate the optical disector (macro written by Christopher S. Ward, Supplemental File) by clicking on \"Plugins\" → \"Macros\" → \"Edit\" (Figure 4t), open the \"opt_dis_grid.txt\" file (Figure 4u), and define the size of the \"usergrid\" in pixels that corresponds with the x,y dimension of the optical disector (Figure 4v). Select a size of 50 µm x 50 µm, so that the size of one side of the usergrid is defined as 212.5 pixels (50 x 4.25 pixels).\nDetermine the position of the optical disector in the stack image by inserting the ImageX and ImageY coordinates that define the center of the optical disector (Figure 4v). Run the macro (\"Macros\" → \"Run Macro\") (Figure 4w).\n\tNOTE: The grid will vanish from the stack image (Figure 3d and Figure 4x). The optical disector will persist when moving down in the z-plane (Figure 3e and Figure 4x).",
    "Select \"Plugins\" → \"Cell Counter\" to start the Cell Counter plugin (Figure 4y). Initialize the Cell Counter and select a marker type (Figure 4z). Zoom in on the image (click on \"+\") and perform the stereological assessment of the cell numbers at a magnification of 200%.\nIdentify dopaminergic neuronal perikarya by their rounded or ovoid shape and cell size (Figure 1a). Quantify the number of cells using stereological rules.\n\tNOTE: Since the optical disector is a 3-dimensional cube (Figure 5a), define the exclusion sides as the front, left, and top sides of the cube (red). Therefore, don't count TH+ cells that come into contact with either the red line (left and front) or the top side. Add the results of the cell counts to the prepared spreadsheet file entitled, \"Calculation of cell count\" (step 5).\nAccording to the SN image, calculate the next grid-square in which to place the optical disector for the next cell count, using x,y steps the size of the overlying grid (Figure 5b) and the \"Optical disector position\" spreadsheet template, as described in step 4.\nPerform an estimation of the cell number using the \"Calculation of cell count\" spreadsheet (step 5).\n4. Calculation of Optical Disector Position Using the \"Optical Disector Position\" Spreadsheet Template\nCalculate the size and position of each optical disector to be placed into the overlying grid within the outline of the SN (Figure 5b) using the \"Optical disector position.xlsx\" spreadsheet file (Supplemental File).\nInsert the conversion of pixel per µm, as defined by the \"Set Scale\" command, into the yellow marked positions of the \"Optical disector position.xlsx\" file (Figure 6a and Supplemental File).",
    "Insert the planned size of the optical disector and the size of the grid-square of the overlying grid, defined by the length of one side (in µm), into the orange marked positions.\n\tNOTE: Results are depicted in the red boxes next to the orange boxes.\nStart with the grid-square within the SN outline that was determined as the starting point (one grid-square was selected to begin with, as in step 3.9, above).\nInsert the x and y coordinates, as measured in step 3.9, into the green boxes of the file (by using these values, the x,y coordinates for the center of the optical disector within this first square are calculated, and the results are depicted in the blue boxes). Run the opt_dis_grid.txt macro (Supplemental File).\nCalculate the x,y coordinates of the consecutive optical disectors by inserting the grid-square distance (measured in number of squares) relative to the first grid-square (brown boxes).\n\tNOTE: +x: grid-square is located to the right; -x: grid-square is located to the left; +y: grid-square is located to the bottom; -y: grid-square is located to the top. Results are shown in the gray boxes.\n5. Estimation of Cell Number Using the \"Calculation of Cell Count\" Spreadsheet\nCalculate the estimated number of TH+ SN cells per animal (N) using the formula published by West et al., 19913, where ∑Q- is defined as the total number of TH+ neurons counted in all optical disectors of one brain section.",
    "NOTE: The height of the optical disector (h) in relation to the measured thickness of the section (t) is included in the equation. The area sampling fraction (asf) is defined as the proportion of the area (A) of the optical disector (A optical disector) frame size within the square size of the grid (A x,y step) (A optical disector/A x,y step) (Figure 3b), and the section sampling fraction (ssf) is defined as the proportion of sections of the whole serially cut brain:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56103/56103eq1.jpg\n\tTo ensure high-quality quantitative estimates, the coefficient of error (CE) should be lower than 0.10. Determine the CE using the formula by Keuker et al., 200110:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56103/56103eq2.jpg\nFor the stereological estimation of the cell number within the SN of each mouse, insert the indicated information regarding the total number of generated series per mouse, the height of the optical disector, the x,y area of the optical disector (A optical disector, in µm2), the x,y area of the grid-square (A x,y step, in µm2), and the mean measured thickness of the section (in µm) in the yellow boxes using the \"Calculation of cell count.xlsx\" spreadsheet file (Figure 6b and Supplemental File).\nAnalyze each SN section from the same animal, as described in step 5.\nInsert cell counts for each optical disector in the gray boxes, each line referring to one SN section, using the \"Calculation of cell count.xlsx\" spreadsheet file (Supplemental File).\n\tNOTE: The estimated cell number and the calculated CE are depicted in the blue boxes (Figure 6b).\n6. Estimation of Cell Number Using a Commercially Available Stereology System\nStart the estimation of dopaminergic SNpc cell number by clicking on \"Probes\" → \"Optical Fractionator Workflow\" to open the Optical Fractionator Workflow window.",
    "NOTE: A new window will pop-up to determine if a new series of SN is going to be counted.\nStart a new series of TH+ SN sections by clicking \"Start a new subject\" in the pop-up window.\nGo through the different steps of the Optical Fractionator Workflow. Set up the subject in the first step. For this, insert the investigator's name, the subject's name (SN group), and other helpful information. Insert the numbers of sections to count for this SN. Insert the thickness of the cut tissue sections. Insert the section interval, which is four in this case. Insert the randomly determined section number to start with.\nIn the second step, set the microscope to low magnification (2X objective) and select \"2X Mag Lens\" from the menu.\nIn step 3, trace the region of interest with the left mouse button, which is the SNpc, as described by Baquet et al., 200917.\nSet the microscope to high magnification in step 4. For this, change the objective to 100X and select \"100X Mag lens\" from the dropdown menu.\nMeasure the mounted thickness in step 5 by focusing to the top and to the bottom of the section.\nIn step 6, define the counting frame size as 50 x 50 µm; this is the size of the optical disector (x,y).\nIn step 7, set the size of the systematic random sampling (SRS) grid as 130 x 130 µm.\nEnter a 3-µm guard zone in step 8.\nSave the settings in step 9.\nFinally, count the TH+ dopaminergic cells in each of the optical disectors within the SRS grid in step 10 of the Optical Fractionator Workflow. For this, start by clicking on the \"Counting\" button.",
    "After finishing one section, click on the \"Begin Next Section\" button to start the Optical Fractionator Workflow of the next SN section of the same SN series.\nWhen the last SN section of one SN series has been quantified, click on \"I've Finished Counting.\"\nClick on the \"View Results\" button to display the results of the stereology sampling.\nSubscription Required.
