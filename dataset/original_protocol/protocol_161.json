The fluorescence emission peak of CFDA SE is approximately 517nm, close to SYBR Green I at about 520nm. CFDA SE can thus only be used in combination with Hoechst 33342. The fluorescence emission peak of DDAO SE is close to 657nm. So, it can be used in combination with either Hoechst 33342 or SYBR Green I.\n1.
