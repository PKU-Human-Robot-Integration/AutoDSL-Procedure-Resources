(2015)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], Börner and Cha (2015a)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1], and Börner and Cha (2015b)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nMeiotic synchronization\nTiming: 6 days\nUpon starvation for nitrogen in the presence of a nonfermentable carbon source, S. cerevisiae diploid cells will do meiosis. Therefore, media with less nutrients are applied to arrest yeast cells in G1 phase and then promote meiosis more synchronously and efficiently (Elrod et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nPatch Cells from glycerol storage at −80°C onto YPG plates and incubate at 30°C overnight (∼14–16 h).\nNote: Glycerol is a non-fermented carbon source. Yeast strains with mitochondrial defects can be screened out on YPG plates. In order to prevent yeast cells entering meiosis in advance, usually do not let yeast cells grow on YPG for more than 16 h.\nStreak yeast cells onto YPD plates and incubate at 30°C for 2–3 days (54–56 h) to obtain single colonies.\nInoculate a whole colony into 4 mL YPD liquid medium in a test tube. Grow at 30°C for 24 h on a roller. Set up three cultures for each strain.\nPick two good YPD cultures for each strain (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Dilute each one into 150 mL SPS II medium in a 2 L flask: 1/500 (300 μL) for WT strain, and 1/50 (3 mL) for rnh1Δrnh201Δhpr1Δ mutant, incubate at 30°C for ∼16 h in a shaker with 200 rpm. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1582-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Examples of YPD culture in step 4",
    "Tube 1, diploid yeast cells grow normally in YPD medium, a large number of cells settle down to the tube bottom, and the culture is slightly cloudy. Tube 2, yeast cells grow poorly in YPD medium as indicated by less sediment. Tube 3, haploid yeast cells as indicated by the clear liquid and all cells settle down to the tube bottom. Tube 4, a culture probably contaminated with bacteria as indicated by no/little cells settle down to the tube bottom and the liquid is too cloudy.\nNote: After 24 h in YPD medium, a good culture gives enough sediment at the tube bottom, meanwhile, the liquid looks slightly cloudy (tube 1). It should also be taken into account that some mutants grow slowly and thus have few sediment (tube 2). It is worth noting that if all cells settle down to the tube bottom with very clear liquid on the top, you should check whether it is a haploid yeast (tube 3). In contrast, if the culture is too cloudy with little sediment at the bottom, the culture may be contaminated (tube 4).\nFor each strain, select one better culture to prepare the meiosis culture.\nThree steps to determine the better culture.\nOptical density. The OD600 of the undiluted culture measured with a spectrophotometer usually is 2.7–2.8, which corresponds to ∼1 × 108 cells per mL. Use SPS II medium as a blank control.\nPercentage of G1/G0 cells. By DAPI staining, assess the percentage of cells in vegetative S-phase (small buds without DAPI bodies) and mitosis (large buds with DAPI at or stretched across the neck) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). These cells should be < 10%. The absence of such mitotic figures may indicate the culture has prematurely entered meiosis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1582-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Examples of DAPI staining in step 5.a.ii",
    "(A) A cell (no bud) in vegetative G1/G0-phase.\n(B) A cell with a small bud (no DAPI signal in the bud or at the neck) in vegetative S-phase.\n(C) A cell with a large bud (with DAPI at or stretched across the neck) in mitosis. Scale bar, 5 μm.\nCell Morphology. 4–8 daughter and mother cells at similar size are beaded (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1582-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Example of “beaded” cells in step 5.a.iii\nA large number of beaded cells indicate that the culture is well synchronized. Scale bar, 5 μm.\nNote: Determine the synchronized culture as quickly as possible.\nCollect cells by centrifugation in 175 mL centrifuge bottles at 1,800 × g for 2 min, 25°C.\nResuspend cells with 150 mL prewarmed SPM.\nRepeat steps b and c.\nTransfer each resuspended culture into one 2 L flask.\nIncubate cultures in a shaker incubator at 30°C, ∼200 rpm. Record the time as 0 h.\nNote: To ensure a better meiosis time-course, prewarm all media used in step 5°C–30°C in an incubator before use.\nCollect a proper amount of samples at desired time points according to your experimental purpose. For chromosome spreading, collect 10 mL cultures every hour during 0–8 h in SPM to detect RNA-DNA hybrids by immunostaining.\nNote: Let the samples sit on ice before you use it. And the differences between WT and mutants in meiosis progression should be taken into account when you decide the time point to collect samples according to your experimental purpose.\nChromosome spreading\nTiming: 1–2 h\nIn the following steps, spheroplasts are prepared and nuclei are spread on slides. Surface spreading of yeast nuclei results in expansion of chromatin with minimal loss of bound proteins (Grubb et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).",
    "Collect 10 mL of meiotic culture with a 15 mL centrifuge tube, and pellet at 1,000 × g for 2 min, 25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells with 2.5 mL 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).\nAdd 50 μL 1 M DTT and mix well.\nLet stand at 25°C for 2 min.\nPellet at 1,000 × g for 2 min, 25°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend with 2.5 mL ZK buffer.\nAdd 5 μL zymolyase 100T solution and mix well. Incubate at 30°C on a roller for ∼25 min, resuspend cells by inverting tubes every 5–10 min during incubation. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nNote: Check progress by placing ∼1 μL of mixture into a large drop of water on a slide and observe under a light microscope. If >90% of cells burst within 1 min, the spheroplasts are ready, then put the samples on ice to stop the reaction.\nPellet cells at 800 × g for 2 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend in 5 mL cold MES wash buffer.\nPellet cells at 800 × g for 2 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend cells in a suitable volume of MES wash buffer (can just barely see through suspension if you lift it up against the light). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nPut 20 μL cells on a slide.\nAdd 40 μL 3% paraformaldehyde with 3.4% sucrose to cells, then quickly add 80 μL 1% lipsol. Mix well with swirling.\nCheck under a microscope, when ∼90% of cells explode (usually within 1 min). Then add 80 μL 3% paraformaldehyde with 3.4% sucrose to the mixture and mix.\nSpread with a clean glass pipet. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nDry in air. It may take more than 4 h.\nStore at −20°C in a slide storage box for 2–3 months, or at −80°C indefinitely.\nImmunofluorescence staining\nTiming: 13–14 h",
    "Dip slides vertically in 0.2% photoflo for 30 s.\nAllow to dry.\nDip in 1× TBS in a horizontal Coplin jar for 15 min.\nDrain the liquid thoroughly but do not dry it.\nPlace the slides horizontally in a moist chamber. Add 200 μL 1× TBS with 1% BSA, cover with a 24 × 60 mm coverslip and incubate for 10 min at 25°C.\nDrain as above.\nDilute the S9.6 antibody using 1× TBS with 1% BSA (1:1,000 dilution works well). Apply 200 μL diluted antibody solution to each slide.\nCover with a coverslip and incubate overnight (∼8–10 h) at 4°C in a moist chamber.\nShake the slide gently to remove the coverslip.\nApply 1×TBS to cover the slide (∼700 μL) and incubate for 5 min at 25°C.\nDrain.\nRepeat steps #33–34 twice.\nAdd 200 μL diluted secondary antibody (1:1,000 of donkey anti-Mouse Alexa 488 antibody in 1× TBS with 1% BSA) to each slide under subdued light.\nCover with coverslip and incubate 1–3 h in a moist chamber in the dark at 25°C.\nRemove coverslip and wash with 1× TBS as before.\nDry in the dark. Put 1 drop of antifade with DAPI. Cover with 24 × 50 mm coverslip, and seal with clear nail polish.\nStore at −20°C in a 100-slide storage box for 1–2 months, or store at −80°C indefinitely.\nS9.6 antibody specificity test\nTiming: 16–17 h",
    "The S9.6 antibody has a highly specific affinity for RNA-DNA hybrids, but it may also bind to other AT-rich RNA-RNA strands, especially the abundant rRNA, although with a much lower affinity (Hartono et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Smolka et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). If necessary, use a RNase H treated sample as a negative control to evaluate the non-specific background. RNase H is an endoribonuclease that specifically hydrolyzes the RNA strands in RNA-DNA hybrids (Lockhart et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Given the instability of single-stranded RNA in vitro, the interference of rRNA on RNA-DNA staining results would be small. If necessary, RNase A in 300 mM NaCl can be used to minimize the effects of rRNA. Under this condition, RNase A can digest RNA but not that in RNA-DNA hybrids (Halász et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nUse a slide that you know the signal of RNA-DNA-hybrids can be detected. Dip the slide into 0.2% photoflo for 30 s.\nAir dry.\nIf necessary, test the specificity of S9.6 antibody.\nFor the use of RNase H, dilute the RNase H enzymes using 1× RNase H buffer (1:200 works well). Add 200 μL diluted RNase H enzymes to each slide.\nFor the use of RNase A, dilute the RNase A (10 mg/mL) to 0.6 ng/μL with 300 mM NaCl solution. Add 200 μL diluted RNase A to each slide.\nCover with coverslip and incubate in moist chamber for 2–3 h at 37°C.\nRemove coverslip and wash in TBS as before.\nPerform S9.6 immunofluorescence staining according to steps 28–40.\nFluorescence microscopy\nTiming: 1–3 h\nTake images with a 100× 1.6 NA oil-immersion objective on two channels individually to observe the signal of DAPI and RNA-DNA hybrids."
