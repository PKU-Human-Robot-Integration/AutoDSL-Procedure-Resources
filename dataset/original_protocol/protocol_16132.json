    "In this protocol, we cover the format of raw SOLiD and Illumina RNA-seq data, necessary file conversions, and steps to ‘clean’ the reads. Cleaning entails the removal of adapter sequences and low-quality bases. This protocol is designed to be carried out using a public Galaxy account. Galaxy is an open-source, web-based platform that enables researchers without command-line programming experience to perform basic bioinformatic analyses (Giardine et al., 2005[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-bib-0010]). The utility of Galaxy lies with its graphical interface, which allows users to interact with their data, perform large-scale operations, and run standard programs, all without exposure to the underlying computational infrastructure. We introduce Galaxy at this stage to provide the reader with a visual sense of the input data prior to downstream analysis at the terminal. Sample data and final output files are provided in the accompanying Supporting Information.\nMaterials\nA personal or desktop computer with internet access\nA public Galaxy user account; register at: https://usegalaxy.org/[href=https://usegalaxy.org/]\nRaw SOLiD small RNA-seq dataset: 1.sRNA_reads/1.raw\nRaw Illumina mRNA-seq dataset: 2.mRNA_reads/1.raw\nProcess the SOLiD small RNA-seq data\n1. Upload the small RNA-seq files to Galaxy.\nTo do this, first navigate to Galaxy at https://usegalaxy.org/[href=https://usegalaxy.org/] and sign in with your account credentials. From the tool panel on the left, select the category ‘Get Data’. Click on the tool ‘Upload file from computer’. Select the option ‘choose a local file’ to browse your file directory. Upload the 12 small RNA data files. See Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-fig-0003] for an annotated layout of the Galaxy workspace.",
    "Each small RNA sample consists of two individual files, with the extensions .qual and .csfasta. There are 12 total files (2 conditions × 3 replicates × 2 sequence files). The .qual file contains a quality score (also known as a Phred or Q score) for each sequenced base. A Q score is an integer ranging from 0 to 42 that is inversely associated with the error probability of the sequenced base, meaning that a base with a higher Q score is more likely to be correct than one with a lower score. The .csfasta file contains the sequenced reads in color space fasta format, where each di-nucleotide (i.e., two consecutive nucleotides) is represented as one of four possible colors (blue=0, green=1, yellow=2, and red=3). This so-called 2-base encoding derives from the ligation-based SOLiD sequencing technology, which differs from the sequencing-by-synthesis method used by Illumina.\nAs an example, here is a single record (i.e., read) from one .csfasta file:\n         \n>135_886_1067_F3\nT32320113231210122000131330201030313\nThe name/identifier of the read is provided in the first line, following ‘>’; this one is designated 135_886_1067_F3 (with F3 indicating that these sequences are to be read in the forward direction, i.e., 5′→ 3′). The second line is the sequence in color space format, apart from the ‘T’, which is the last sequenced base of the primer.\nHere is the same read from the corresponding .qual file:\n         \n>135_886_1067_F3\n31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 28 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31 31\nFor each of the 35 sequenced bases in the .csfasta file (not including the ‘T’), there is an associated quality score in the .qual file.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/fe232678-7ad4-487a-8316-93cfad29a923/cppb20090-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",
    "Layout of the Galaxy workspace. The tool panel is shown, with arrows indicating the location of tools used in this article. The history panel is also shown, containing user-uploaded files as well as output files.\n2. For each sample, combine the .qual and .csfasta files into a single fastq file.\nUnder the tool category ‘NGS: QC and manipulation’, select ‘Convert SOLiD output to fastq’. For the ‘reads’ option, provide the .csfasta file (e.g., sRNA_E1_10k.csfasta), and for the ‘qualities’ option, provide the corresponding .qual file for that sample (e.g., sRNA_E1_10k.qual). Set ‘trim trailing F3 and R3?’ to ‘yes’.\nNow, the read above is represented in fastqcssanger format as follows:\n         \n@135_886_1067\nT32320113231210122000131330201030313\n+\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@=@@@@@@@@@@@@@@\nIn fastq format, each record consists of four lines. The identity of the read is defined in the header, following the @ sign. The sequence (still in color space here) is in the second line. The third line is a plus sign, which separates the sequence and quality information. The fourth line contains Q scores as before, but now they have been converted to corresponding ASCII (base 33) characters.\n3. Decode the sequence from color space to base space.\nUse the tool ‘FASTQ Groomer’ under the category ‘NGS: QC and manipulation’. For ‘file to groom’, select the fastqcssanger file generated from step 2. For ‘input FASTQ quality scores type’, select ‘color space sanger’.\nNow the read is represented in standard fastq sanger format:\n         \n@135_886_1067\nAGCTTGTAGCAGTTGAGGGGTACGCCTTGGCCGTA\n+\n@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@=@@@@@@@@@@@@@@",
    "Note that conversion from color space to base space was possible due to the known identity of the first base, i.e., the ‘T’ remaining from the primer sequence. With 2-base encoding, each color represents four possible di-nucleotides, so knowledge of the first base is essential for correct decoding. If you are working with SOLiD data that does not contain a known first base, then you must instead convert the reference sequence (i.e., genome or transcriptome) to color space for downstream alignments. However, since the SOLiD platform has been discontinued commercially since 2016, this option is not incorporated in all mapping tools, so be sure to select a mapper that includes this feature if required.\n4. Obtain an overview of library quality.\nRun the ‘FastQC’ tool under the category ‘NGS: QC and manipulation’. The file to be evaluated is the fastq output from step 3.\nFastQC evaluates multiple areas, including per-base quality scores, overrepresented sequences, duplicated sequences, adapter contamination, and kmer/GC content. Each test result is associated with a green check mark (normal), orange triangle (slightly abnormal), or red cross (very unusual). The assumption is that normal libraries are random and diverse; however, some experiments or library preparation methods create expected biases, so an abnormal or failed result is not always cause for concern. For example, RNA-seq libraries that have incorporated random priming will tend to fail the ‘per base sequence content’ check, since random priming has inherent sequence bias. However, this does not impede downstream analysis.\n5. Remove contaminating adapter sequences.\nSelect the ‘Clip’ tool from the category ‘NGS: QC and manipulation’. For input, select the fastq file output from step 3. Set ‘minimum sequence length’ to 18, ‘custom clipping sequence’ to CGCCTTGGCCGTACAGCAG, and both ‘discard sequences with unknown bases’ and ‘output only clipped sequences’ to ‘yes’.",
    "Due to adapter read-through, which occurs when a sequenced fragment is shorter than the defined read length of sequencing, a portion of raw reads will include contamination of the form 5′-REALSEQUENCEADAPTER-3′. This is solved by truncating reads at the first base of identified adapter sequence. If your RNA-seq data were obtained from a sequencing company, the company will provide you with the adapter associated with each library. If you are working with publicly available data, you may not have access to the adapter sequence. In this case, FastQC should have identified the adapter in the previous step, either as an ‘overrepresented sequence’ or a standard adapter.\nThe remaining parameters are set to filter out reads unlikely to be derived from bona fide miRNAs. Since most miRNAs are 21 nt, we set the minimum length after adapter clipping to 18 nt. Similarly, given our read length of 35 bp, any read derived from a true miRNA should contain adapter read-through; therefore, we output only sequences that were clipped. Non-clipped reads are likely derived from longer products of RNA degradation. Finally, discarding bases with unknown nucleotides is important for downstream miRNA and target prediction, both of which rely on sequence alignment.\n6. Remove low-quality bases from reads.\nSelect ‘Trimmomatic’ from the category ‘NGS: QC and manipulation’. Specify that the data are single-end reads and choose the adapter-trimmed fastq file produced from step 5 as input. Select ‘sliding window trimming’ as the operation to perform, with default parameters.",
    "As you may have observed from the per-base sequence quality plot in the FastQC report, Q values decline steadily toward the 3′ end of reads; this is due to a reduced signal-to-noise ratio with increased amplification. Some programs resolve this issue by truncating the read at the first base below a specified quality threshold. Trimmomatic offers a more flexible ‘sliding window’ approach, truncating the read once the average Q value (over four bases) is reduced to 20.\n7. Apply a final length filter.\nUse the tool ‘Filter FASTQ’ from the category ‘NGS: QC and manipulation’. Set ‘maximum length’ to 28 nt.\nThis filter removes reads unlikely to be miRNAs.\n8. Convert the fastq file to fasta format.\nChoose the tool ‘FASTQ to FASTA’ from the category ‘Convert Formats’. For input, select the output fastq file from step 7. Set ‘rename sequence names in output file’ to ‘no’.\nThis is the processed file that will be used for downstream miRNA prediction. The conversion from fastq to fasta (i.e., removal of quality information) was made to conform with input requirements of downstream software.\nThe read that we were tracking above now looks like this:\n         \n>135_886_1067\nAGCTTGTAGCAGTTGAGGGGTA\nA comparison with the raw sequence reveals that the adapter was trimmed correctly.\nProcess the Illumina mRNA-seq data\n9. Upload the mRNA-seq data to Galaxy.\nSee the instructions provided in step 1.\nEach mRNA-seq sample has two paired fastq files, designated R1 or R2, indicating that they contain sequences in the forward or reverse-complement orientations, respectively. There are twelve mRNA-seq files (2 conditions × 3 replicates × 2 paired sequence files).\nA read from an R1 file looks like this:\n         \n@HWI-D00423:99:HB533ADXX:2:1213:12544:78916 1:N:0:CGATGT\nTTCCTGTAGGCTGGGAGATTGGAAAGGTACCATGCGATTAATGGGCTGGATGTCACTGGGGTCTCAAGTCCTCCAATGAATGGGTCTCCATTCAAGGGCTGGATTACTTGGTATGTTTGCTTATCAGATTGAATGGCCTTGATGGTAAAGG\n+\n@CBFFFFFHGHHHJJHIIJIJJIJJJJEFHIIJJJJIJJJIJIJJJJJJJJJJIJIIJJJJHHHHHHHFFFFFFEEEEEEEDDDCDDDDDDFFEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDACDDEEEDDDDDDDEEDCDDDDDDDDDDDDCDDDDEDDDD",
    "This format is identical to that above for the small RNA reads in fastq format. The only difference is that the header contains additional information.\nThe paired read from the corresponding R2 file looks like this:\n         \n@HWI-D00423:99:HB533ADXX:2:1213:12544:78916 2:N:0:CGATGT\nCAACAACATCACCAATGGCCAGCCAATTAAAGAGTGGCTTCACCGCAACAATTGTGACTCCCAAGGGCATCTCTGGTCCTGCCTTAAGGCCCTTCCCTTCCATCAGGAGGCACCATTCCTTTACCATCAAGGCCATTCAATCTGATAAGCA\n+\nCCCFFFFFHHHHHJJJJJJJJJJJJIJJJJIJJJGHJJJJJJJJIJJJJIJJJJIIJIIJJJHHGFFFFEEDEEEECCDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDEEDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDEEEEDDEDEDDDDC\n10. Run FastQC on each fastq file to obtain an overview of quality.\nThe ‘FastQC’ tool can be run as in step 4. Since the raw mRNA-seq reads are already in fastq format, no additional conversions are necessary.\n11. Remove adapter sequences and low-quality bases, and apply a minimum length filter.\nUse ‘Trimmomatic’ from step 6. Specify that the reads are paired-end and provide the R1 and R2 files. Choose ‘yes’ to ‘perform initial ILLUMINACLIP step’. Choose ‘Truseq3 paired-end adapters’ from the available adapter sequences. Add two additional options: ‘sliding window trimming’ as before and ‘drop reads below a specified read length’ (default is 20 nt).\nSince paired-end data are available, palindromic mode can be engaged in Trimmomatic for improved detection of partial adapter sequences, down to as little as one nucleotide. Another useful feature of Trimmomatic is that it maintains correspondence of paired-end reads; that is, if one member of the pair fails quality control, the other member of the pair is automatically discarded. Correspondence between paired-end files is often required for downstream software.\n12. Download and save the clean small RNA-seq and mRNA-seq files.\nAt this point, you should have 18 total files (6 small RNA-seq fasta files and 12 paired mRNA-seq fastq files). To check that all steps were performed correctly, compare your results with the clean files 1.sRNA_reads/2.clean and 2.mRNA_reads/2.clean (see Supporting Information).",
    "This protocol covers de novo transcript assembly and annotation using Trinity and Trinotate, respectively. We combine the clean mRNA-seq reads of all samples to produce a single reference transcriptome. From the assembled transcripts, the most likely open reading frames (ORFs) and their translated protein sequences are obtained using TransDecoder. The transcript and protein sequences are used in BLASTX and BLASTP homology searches, respectively, against the curated SwissProt protein database. Additionally, the protein sequences are searched for conserved Pfam protein domains. Using Trinotate, the search results are built into a comprehensive annotation report that provides insight into the function of each transcript.

The latter parameter means that for each pair, the R1 read will be reverse-complemented, while the R2 read will be processed as-is in the forward direction. Note that the relationship between read-pairs depends on the strategy employed during strand-specific library preparation.\nThe ‘samples’ file is a tab-delimited text file specifying the location of clean mRNA-seq reads and information about biological replicates for downstream analysis.

    "This protocol covers miRNA prediction and the identification of conserved and novel miRNAs. Plant miRNA precursors tend to be longer and more structurally complex than those of animals; therefore, we use miRDeep-P for miRNA prediction since it adopts plant-specific scoring criteria. First, we process the clean small RNA reads to remove undesired species (rRNA, tRNA, snoRNA, snRNA), preventing their mis-annotation as miRNAs. From the filtered small RNA dataset, we prepare a collapsed small RNA fasta file required by miRDeep-P. miRNAs are then predicted as follows: (1) aligning small RNAs to the reference mRNA transcriptome; (2) extracting and folding the mRNA sequence surrounding aligned regions; (3) evaluating small RNAs within the folded structure, based on experimentally determined features of plant miRNA biogenesis. The ‘evaluation’ step comprises the core algorithm of miRDeep-P. Following prediction, the miRNAs are annotated based on sequence conservation with known plant miRNAs.

    "This protocol covers mRNA and miRNA differential expression analysis. We begin by quantifying mRNA transcript abundance. The clean RNA-seq reads are aligned back to the reference transcriptome using Bowtie2, then alignments are processed with RSEM to estimate the number of reads derived from each transcript. From these results, we generate a matrix containing the number of reads per transcript for each sample. This count matrix is used as input for differential expression testing with edgeR. miRNA differential expression analysis follows the same procedure, except that quantification with RSEM is not necessary (since one small RNA read = one miRNA). This protocol relies on wrapper scripts packaged with Trinity. Wrapper scripts are helpful for those with limited command-line experience, executing programs ‘behind the scene’ rather than requiring direct interaction from the user.

For example, if we apply a p-value threshold of 0.05, this means that 5% of all tests (i.e., 0.05 × 3000 transcripts) may be incorrectly detected as being differentially expressed. By contrast, an FDR threshold of 0.05 means that 5% of the significant tests (i.e., 0.05 × 0.05 × 3000) may be incorrectly identified as differentially expressed.

    "This protocol covers GO term functional enrichment analysis. GO terms are structured, curated concepts relating to gene functions. A gene product may be annotated in up to three categories: molecular function, cellular component, and biological process. The ontology is structured as a directed graph in which each term has defined relationships to one or more other terms. Lower-level terms have greater specificity than higher-level ones. In this protocol, we use GOseq to identify functional associations that are over-represented among the differentially expressed miRNA/target pairs. GOseq also corrects for transcript length bias: the fact that longer transcripts are more likely to be identified as differentially expressed than shorter transcripts.

Specifically, the 5′ end of the expected cleaved target is cloned and sequenced to assess whether it underwent slicing by a miRNA-guided Argonaute protein. This method takes advantage of the exposed 5′ monophosphate on the target that results from miRNA-induced cleavage. First, the poly(A) mRNA pool (from the Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0008]) undergoes 5′ ligation with an RNA adapter. Then, the mRNA pool is reverse transcribed into cDNA using a 3′ d(T) adapter. To enrich for low-abundance cleavage products, the cDNA pool is subjected to nonspecific PCR amplification using primers annealing to the RNA adapter and 3′ d(T) adapter. Finally, the specific target is amplified using a 5′ adapter primer and 3′ gene-specific primer. Sequences to facilitate cloning into a vector using Gibson assembly are introduced by a subsequent PCR of the specific target.

In some cases, we observed randomly distributed cleavage surrounding the expected site. This suggested that the limit of detection had been reached: background levels of mRNA degradation were as high as the miRNA cleavage. Thus, it is difficult to obtain trustworthy, reproducible results with RLM-RACE when abundance of the miRNA and/or target is low (e.g., < 10 counts per million and < 100 transcripts per million respectively).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/96b194c3-ea15-4927-847b-4e1899b7806a/cppb20090-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7",

    "In this protocol, we cover total RNA extraction from plant tissue and steps to enrich for either small RNA or mRNA. RNAzol reagent is used to enable extraction of both total RNA and small RNA from a single plant sample. Total RNA is obtained first. Plant tissue is ground in liquid nitrogen, followed by addition of RNAzol; DNA and protein contaminants are removed through centrifugation, then total RNA is precipitated with ethanol. Using the supernatant reserved from total RNA extraction, the small RNA fraction is then obtained by isopropanol precipitation. mRNA enrichment is performed using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module on the previously extracted total RNA. Starting with high-quality RNA is critical for the success of downstream validations. Specifically, total RNA, small RNA, and mRNA will be used for qRT-PCR and stem-loop qRT-PCR (Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0009]), and RLM-RACE (Basic Protocol 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0007]), respectively.

    "Here, we cover validation of miRNA and target differential expression results from RNA-seq using stem-loop qRT-PCR and standard qRT-PCR, respectively. Both methods rely on the same underlying principle: a relative fold change is determined by quantifying RNA levels of the species of interest under each condition and normalizing the expression change to an internal control that is stably expressed for the treatment under study. To prepare for qPCR, the RNA of interest and the internal control are both reverse transcribed into cDNA using gene-specific primers. Then, qPCR is conducted to quantify cDNA levels, based on fluorescence occurring from intercalation of dye into the double-stranded PCR product. In terms of primer design for stem-loop and standard qRT-PCR (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-fig-0008]), the latter is straightforward in that primers must simply produce a product of 150 to 200 bp. In contrast, the short length of miRNAs (∼21 nt) necessitates use of a specialized stem-loop primer during reverse transcription to increase the melting point of the product, followed by PCR using a reverse primer complementary to the stem-loop and a forward primer specific to the miRNA.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8526020e-4006-438e-8280-0a698fbe8eee/cppb20090-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nPrimer design for qRT-PCR validation of mRNA and miRNA expression. (A) The ideal product size for a qRT-PCR reaction is between 150 and 200 bp. Wherever possible, forward primers (FPs) and reverse primers (RPs) should be designed to span an intron, which will reduce the level of genomic DNA amplification from contamination and allow its detection on an agarose gel for troubleshooting. (B) miRNAs require reverse transcription with a reverse primer bearing a stem-loop, which serves to increase the length and melting point of the PCR product, to be compatible with standard PCR cycling.",
    "Following qPCR, the ΔΔCt formula is used to determine the relative fold change. The Ct value is the PCR cycle at which fluorescence rises above a set threshold during exponential amplification. The lower the Ct value, the higher the abundance of the RNA under study. A statistical test is conducted to determine whether the RNA abundance is significantly different between the experimental and control conditions. Finally, the fold changes obtained by qRT-PCR are correlated with those obtained by RNA-seq to determine whether the two methods of RNA quantification agree. Note that although most miRNA/target pairs under validation should be randomly selected, those of special interest are also tested.\nMaterials\nTotal RNA or small RNA of interest (Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0008])\nPrimers in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-tbl-0002]\n10 mM dNTPs (NEB N0446S)\n5× first-strand buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-rec-0001])\n0.1 M DTT\n40 U/µl murine RNase inhibitor (NEB M0314S)\n200 U/µl Superscript III reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher 18080093)\n2× SYBR Green mastermix (Bimake B21202)\n0.2-ml PCR tubes\nRotor-GeneQ qRT-PCR System (Qiagen)\nTable 2.\n                Primers for qRT-PCR\ntable:\n﻿Primer name,Sequence (5′ to 3′),Usage\nmRNA/Internal Control Reverse Transcriptase Primer (RTase RP),…XXXXXXXX…,\"Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0009], step 1\"\nmiRNA/Internal Control Stem Loop RTase Primer,GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGAC-XXXXXX,\"Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0009], step 1\"\nmRNA/Internal Control Forward Primer (FP),…XXXXXXXX…,\"Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0009], step 4\"\nmRNA/Internal Control Reverse Primer (RP),…XXXXXXXX…,\"Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0009], step 4\"\nmiRNA/Internal Control Forward Primer,…XXXXXXXX….,\"Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0009], step 4\"\nUniversal Reverse Primer (RP),CCAGTGCAGGGTCCGAGGTA,\"Basic Protocol 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0009], step 4\"\na X's indicate sequence complementarity with the miRNA/mRNA under validation.\nReverse transcribe the total RNA and small RNA\n1. Dilute 250 ng of total RNA or small RNA (Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-prot-0008]) in 11 µl distilled H2O. Add the following reagents:\n         \n1 µl 10 µM mRNA reverse transcriptase primer or stem-loop RTase primer\n1 µl 10 mM dNTPs.",
    "Prepare separate samples for each miRNA and target. For miRNA samples, use the stem-loop reverse primer shown in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-tbl-0002]; for target samples, use a standard reverse primer.\nPrepare the appropriate internal controls for both the miRNA and mRNA. Internal controls are chosen based on their levels remaining stable for the treatment under study. Guidance in choosing appropriate internal controls is included in the Critical Parameters section. At least two miRNA and two mRNA internal controls should be included.\n2. Denature the RNA at 65°C for 10 min, then place on ice for at least 2 min. Add the following reagents:\n         \n4 µl 5× first-strand buffer\n1 µl 0.1 M DTT\n1 µl 40 U/µl murine RNase inhibitor\n1 µl 200 U/µl Superscript III reverse transcriptase.\n3. Mix well, then incubate at 50°C for 1 hr to perform reverse transcription. Inactivate the reverse transcriptase at 70°C for 15 min.\nStore cDNA at −20°C until needed.\nQuantify miRNA and target abundance using qPCR\n4. For each sample, set up the following reaction in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube to perform qPCR:\n         \n5 µl reverse transcription product (from step 3)\n2 µl 10 µM mRNA forward primer or miRNA forward primer\n2 µl 10 µM mRNA reverse primer or universal reverse primer\n23 µl distilled H2O\n33 µl 2× SYBR Green qRT-PCR mastermix.\nFor miRNA samples, use the universal reverse primer shown in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-tbl-0002]; for target samples, use a standard reverse primer.\nEnsure that the reverse transcription product does not exceed 10% of the total reaction volume; otherwise, it will inhibit the PCR reaction due to carryover of buffer and primers.\n5. Aliquot the above mixture into three 0.2-ml PCR tubes at 20 µl per tube. Place on ice until you are ready to run the assay in the RotorGene Q system.",
    "The three aliquots per sample serve as technical replicates for qPCR.\n6. Insert the tubes into the 36-place rotor and affix the locking ring. Place into the machine and run with the following settings:\n         \nHold 1: 50°C for 20 sec\nHold 2: 95°C for 600 sec\nCycling: 95°C for 15 sec, 60°C for 60 sec\nMelt: Ramp from 58°C to 95°C\n               \nRising by 1°C each step\nWait for 90 sec of pre-melt conditioning on first step\nWait for 5 sec for each step afterwards\nAcquire to Melt A on Green\nUncheck optimize gain before melt on all tubes.\n7. Upon completion of program, remove PCR tubes from machine. Download the run file (.rex) and the Rotor-Gene Q Series software; run in virtual mode with serial number 123456 to analyze data on different computers.\nAnalyze the qPCR results\n8. Use the ΔΔCt equation below to determine relative fold change:\n         imgsrc:/cms/asset/298b657d-8507-4d10-89ea-a226848dfe6b/cppb20090-math-0001.png\nNote that this equation assumes equal amplification efficiencies of primers for both the gene of interest and internal control.\n9. After calculation of fold change, test for differential expression using the Student's t-test on Ct values.\n10. Create a scatterplot that compares the fold change by RNA-seq against the fold change by qRT-PCR. Make two separate plots, one for miRNAs and one for targets, with each point on the graph representing a single miRNA or target. Calculate the R2 correlation value to quantify the strength of the linear relationship between the two methods. An example of such a plot comparing the fold change of eight JA-responsive miRNAs measured by RNA-seq and qRT-PCR is illustrated in Neller et al. (2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20090#cppb20090-bib-0022])."
