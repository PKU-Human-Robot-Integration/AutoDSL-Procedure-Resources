    "All in vivo studies were approved by the University of Notre Dame Animal Care and Use Committee and used female C57/BL6J mice.\n1. Murine Ovarian Cancer Cell Culture\nMake the ID8 murine ovarian cancer cell culture medium as follows: 1 L of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin, 5 µg/ml Insulin, 5 µg/ml Transferrin and 5 ng/ml Sodium Selenite.\nTransduce ID8 murine ovarian cancer cells13 to express Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) using commercially procured lentiviral particles expressing RFP and a selection marker (blasticidin gene). Note that green fluorescent protein can be used, but provides a weaker fluorescence signal.\n\t\nImmediately prior to transduction, culture cells to 50 - 70% confluence and add fresh medium (without penicillin/streptomycin) that includes 1 ml polybrene (5 µg/ml final concentration).\nGently pipette RFP-lentivirus (20 µl) dropwise into the dish and incubate at 37 oC for 72 hr. Remove medium and incubate with fresh medium for 24 hr. Begin selection of transduced cells by adding blasticidin to the culture medium (5 µg/ml) and monitor for red cells using fluorescence microscopy (Figure1).\nCulture the RFP-tagged cells in ID8 medium by seeding approximately 106 cells into a tissue culture dish and visualizing daily using a light microscope until the cell monolayer is confluent.\nWhen confluent, harvest the cells using trypsin (0.25%, 3 min) and return the flask to the 37 oC incubator until the cells are detached.\nNeutralize the trypsin with 6 ml of ID8 culture medium containing serum. Pipette up and down against the bottom of the dish, then transfer to a 15 ml conical tube. Centrifuge at 1,200 RPM for 2 min, then aspirate the medium using a glass pipette.",
    "Wash the cells with Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) by gently resuspending in 6 ml warm PBS and centrifuging as in 1.5 above. Re-suspend in PBS to a final concentration of 5 x 106 cells/ml. Keep cells warm (37 oC) until injection.\n2. Intra-peritoneal Injection of ID8 Cells and in vivo Imaging\nInject each mouse with 2 mL of the warm ID8-PBS solution for a total of 10 million cells through intra-peritoneal (i.p.) injection. Allow tumor cells to grow in vivo for approximately 10 weeks with weekly live imaging.\nImmediately following injection and each week thereafter, weigh the mice and then anesthetize each mouse using isofluorane (2.5% flow rate in 0.5 L/min O2 flow). Note: The mice were weighed, not as a quantitative measure of tumor burden, but rather a more general measure of individual mouse physical progression throughout the study.  Mice weights were compared with their own previous weight values.  \n\t\nAnesthetize mice by placing in an isofluorane chamber. Maintain constant anesthesia while scanning by positioning the mouse head in the nose-cone for exposure to 2.5% flow rate isofluorane throughout the procedure.\nUse depilatory cream to remove the hair on the torso and abdomen of each mouse, as the black hair will cause attenuation of the fluorescence signal. Mice are bathed with warm water after application of the depilatory cream and dried with RT paper towels.  \nWhile anesthetized, scan the entire body of each mouse using a small animal optical imaging system. Scan all mice in a cohort at each time point. Use the following two step protocol (Figure 2A):",
    "In Step 1, to observe fluorescently labeled (RFP) tumor cells, execute multispectral acquisition to collect a total of 5 images using excitation filters of 440 nm, 460 nm, 480 nm, 520 nm and 540 nm, and an emission filter of 600 nm. Use the following acquisition parameters: a standard exposure of 15 sec, 2 x 2 binning, FOV of 160 mm, and fstop of 1.1.\nIn Step 2, to observe the whole animal, acquire a reflectance image using an open excitation filter (white light), an open emission filter, a standard exposure of 0.2 sec with 2 x 2 binning and an FOV of 16 cm.  Note: The actual imaging time is ~1 min. \n3. Mouse Dissection and Image Acquisition\nWhen live imaging shows the presence of extensive intra-peritoneal disease or animals exhibit accumulation of ascites (as evidenced by abdominal distension), loss or gain of body weight greater than 20%, lethargy or other signs of distress, euthanize each mouse using CO2 anesthesia followed by cervical dislocation.\nCut the skin anteriorly along the ventral midline of the mouse, using pointed dissection scissors, from the top of the thighs to the bottom of the rib cage. Take extreme care to cut through only the skin layer (Figure 2Bi). Gently separate the skin from the peritoneal tissue, being sure to not puncture the peritoneal wall.\nUsing pointed dissection scissors, cut laterally both along the bottom of the rib cage and the top of the thighs to create two flaps of skin (Figure 2B ii,iii).\nPlace each mouse on its ventral side (peritoneal cavity facing downward) with the skin flaps pulled open and scan each mouse with its organs in situ using the small animal optical imaging system (Figure 3A,B).\n\t\nUse the same image acquisition parameters as described in 2.4.1.-2.4.2.",
    "Continue dissecting the mouse by extracting individual peritoneal organs including liver, omentum/pancreas, stomach, diaphragm, small intestine, large intestine, left and right peritoneum, ovaries, kidneys, mesentery and fat pad.\n\t\nObserve, enumerate, and record visible tumors on each organ. Use a caliper to measure the diameter of each tumor.\nDesignate tumors less than 2 mm in diameter as small, in between 2 and 5 mm as medium and greater than 5 mm as large.\nPlace the organs on the organ scanning template (Figure 4) that identifies a predetermined location for each organ. Use PBS to keep the organs moist.\nScan each sheet of organs using the small animal optical imaging system (Figure 3C,D).\n\t\nUse the same image acquisition parameters as described in step 2.4.\nAfter scanning, place organs in 10% formaldehyde to enable subsequent processing for histology.\n4. Quantification of Tumor Burden in the Fluorescence Images\nIn order to reduce the amount of auto-fluorescence in each multispectral scan, first unmix the files using software available with the small animal imaging system.\n\t\nLoad first the RFP: In Vivo spectral file, followed by the Autofluor: In Vivo Red file in the Unmixed Images window and select Unmix.\nExport the .bip files as 16 bit .tiff (unscaled) format .\nUse ImageJ software (ex vivo organs and then the full mouse body with organs in situ).\nUse File > Open to open the 16 bit .tiff files of the organ scanning template files in ImageJ.\nUnder Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast, choose to Set the Minimum displayed value to 0 and the Maximum displayed value to +35353 and then under Image > Lookup Tables, select Red Hot. Note: Various animal models will require different brightness levels, but it is important to keep the brightness consistent throughout a given study.",
    "Using the Freehand Selection tool, draw a free-form region of interest selection (ROI) around each organ and use the Measure tool (CTRL+M) to calculate the surface area of each organ; record the surface Area of each organ in a spreadsheet.\nWith the ROI drawn around each organ, right click within the ROI and select Duplicate to include only the organ.\nWhile looking at the individual organ, under Image > Adjust > Threshold, choose to Set the threshold of the image to a Lower Threshold Level of + 1200 and an Upper Threshold Level of + 1700 to select only the most brightly fluorescing regions and check to select Dark Background; select OK. Note: The images may require manual manipulation of the threshold sliders in ImageJ so that the previously brightest areas are selected for the analysis step, as shown above.  Different disease models will require different threshold constraints, but it is important to keep the threshold levels consistent throughout a given study.\nUnder Analyze > Analyze Particles, change the Size (pixels ^ 2) to 10-Infinity, choose to Show: Outlines, check to select only \"Display results\" and click OK to measure both the areas and raw integrated densities of these bright regions, deemed tumors.\nRecord the values of the surface Area and the Raw Integrated Density of each tumor selection displayed in the Results table in the same spreadsheet containing the organ surface areas.",
    "Under Analyze > Tools > Calibration Bar, add a calibration scale bar to the images of the organs. Note: In this example, this was done by changing the Location to Upper Right, the Fill Color to Black, the Label Color to White, the Number of Labels to 5, the Decimal Places to 0, the Font Size to 12 and the Zoom Factor to 4.0 and enabling Bold Text.\nUnder File > Save As…, save the montage as a .Tiff and .Jpeg.\nUse File > Open to open the .jpeg file of the organs and then under Insert > Text Box, add organ labels by creating a text box below each of the three rows of organs.\nUse File > Open to open each of the 16 bit .tiff files of the full body scans in ImageJ in order of mouse number.\nUnder Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast, choose to Set the Minimum displayed value to 0 and the Maximum displayed value to + 35353 and then under Image > Lookup Tables, select Red Hot.\nUnder File > Save As…, save the montage as a .Tiff and .Jpeg.\n5. Data Analysis\nAdd the tumor selection areas and raw integrated densities, respectively, for each organ of each mouse and record the total organ tumor area for each mouse.\nNormalize the recorded area and raw integrated density values for the size of each organ by dividing the total tumor area and total raw integrated density values by the corresponding organ surface area (Table 1).\nCalculate and plot the average of both the normalized tumor surface areas and the normalized raw integrated density values (Figure 5A,B).\nCompare these average values to those obtained by visually counting the tumors that were visible to the naked eye during the inspection of each organ for metastatic lesions.",
