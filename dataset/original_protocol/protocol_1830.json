    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSciatic nerve dissection\nTiming: ∼ 2 h\nThe steps of the sciatic nerve dissection 24 h after sciatic nerve injury are described in this section.\nSacrifice mouse by cervical dislocation 24 h after sciatic nerve injury.\nSpray the entire body with 70% ethanol and remove skin and internal organs to make dissection easier.\nTransfer the clean mouse body to a foam board and fix the fore and hind limbs on the board with four bent 20g needles keeping the back of the mouse onto the board.\nDissect the tissues under the dissection microscope.\nUsing the student vannas spring scissors, carefully cut the ventral vertebrae and expose the spinal cord using forceps.\nL4-L6 sciatic DRG are located in the intervertebral foramen, carefully dissect these DRG by cutting the branches that are connected to them. Next, collect them in 1 mL 1× PBS with protease and phosphatase inhibitors in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube on ice for other experiments.\nTranspose the mouse body with its back upwards and fix it on the board again.\nOpen the sciatic nerve wound with the hardened fine scissors and expose the injured sciatic nerve carefully with forceps.\nRemove the attached tissues as well as a very thin nerve near the main branch.\nCarefully grab the injured end of the proximal segment of the sciatic nerve with forceps and pull it along the spine.\nOnce the nerve is pulled out as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, immediately place it in a 3.5 cm cell culture dish with 2 mL 0.2× PBS with protease and phosphatase inhibitors on ice.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1423-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Sciatic nerve and sciatic dorsal roots dissection\n(A and B) Dissected sciatic nerve segment (A) and sciatic dorsal roots attached with L4-L6 DRG (B)",
    "Collect 10 sciatic nerves from 5 mice in one 3.5 cell culture dish, therefore preparing 2 dishes for 10 mice.\nCollect sciatic nerves from animals that have received the sham injury.\nCut the nerves with the microdissection scissor in the wound site.\nPull it out carefully with forceps after tissue clearance.\nThe length of the nerve should be the same as that collected from the mice who had SNA injuries. The overall length is about 1.8 cm in total as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A for an adult mouse.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1423-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Sciatic nerve length measurement and fascicles separation\n(A and B) Measuring sciatic nerve segment length (A) and separation of fascicles (B)\nCritical: Mouse should be euthanized in a fume hood to avoid allergies caused by animal hairs and taken out after skin is removed. Dissection has to be done as soon as possible after the mouse has been sacrificed. Keep the cell culture dishes on ice the whole time. Sciatic DRG must be harvested before nerve dissection for the nerves to be easily pulled out.\nDorsal root dissection\nTiming: ∼ 4 h\nThis section describes the steps of the sciatic dorsal root dissection 24 h after spinal cord injury.\nWhen collecting sciatic dorsal roots from mice that received a spinal cord injury or laminectomy, fix them on the foam board with their backs down.\nDissect the tissues under the dissection microscope.\nCut the ventral vertebrae using the student vannas spring scissors carefully without cutting the dorsal roots and expose the spinal cord with forceps.\nCarefully dissect L4-L6 sciatic DRG out from the intervertebral foramen using forceps without breaking the roots.\nSeparate the dorsal from the ventral root and track along the spine until you reach the dorsal root entry zone.",
    "Collect the dorsal root segment that extends from the DRG to the dorsal root entry zone. The L6 dorsal root is the longest (∼ 1.5cm) as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B.\nPool dorsal roots from 7 and 8 mice in one 3.5cm cell culture dish and always keep the dish on ice. Prepare 2 dishes for a total of 15 mice.\nCritical: When sacrificing mice, perform cervical translocation gently without breaking the spinal cord and dorsal roots. Carefully cut and remove the ventral vertebrae as the L6 DRG dorsal root is very thin and easy to be cut off.\nAxoplasm extraction\nTiming: ∼ 4 h\nThis section explains how to extract axoplasm after tissue dissection.\nTransfer the nerves to a new 3.5 cm cell culture dish with 2 mL 0.2× PBS with protease and phosphatase inhibitors.\nCut each nerve into 2 pieces. Gently expose and separate nerve fascicles under the dissection microscope with fine forceps until they become cloudy and float in the dish as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B.\nTransfer the floating fascicles to a fresh 2 mL Eppendorf tube containing 500 μL 0.2× PBS with inhibitors, keep the tube on ice. Transfer fascicles immediately after they become cloudy and start the separation on the next nerve.\nOnce finish, incubate the Eppendorf tube at 20°C–22°C for 2 h.\nAfter incubation, transfer fascicles to a new 2 mL Eppendorf tube and wash them with 1 mL 0.2× PBS with inhibitors. Wash 5 min on the roller mixer.\nRepeat the washing steps 2 more times.\nAfter washing, transfer the fascicles into a new empty 2 mL Eppendorf tube to remove liquid, repeat this step once.\nTransfer the fascicles to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 300 μL 1× PBS with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and incubate at 20°C–22°C for 30 min.",
    "Pre-cool the centrifuge to 4°C during incubation, centrifuge at 10,000×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, the total volume is about 500 μL.\nThe axoplasm is ready for concentration.\nCritical: Complete the fascicles separation as soon as possible. In the final incubation step (step 15), pool fascicles from the sciatic nerve (10 mice) or from the dorsal roots (15 mice) to one 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nPause point: Stop here for the first day and store the axoplasm at 4°C for up to 72 h or proceed to the next concentration step.\nAxoplasm concentration and buffer exchange\nTiming: ∼ 4 h\nThis section describes the steps of axoplasm concentration and buffer exchange before mass spectrometry.\nPrepare the Amicon® Pro device by attaching the Amicon® Ultra-0.5 filter to the base of the exchange device.\nAdd 500 μL TBST with 1% Tween20 to the exchange device, close the cap and centrifuge at 4,000×g for 1 min at 4°C.\nAdd 500 μL 1× PBS with inhibitors to the exchange device, close the cap and centrifuge at 4,000×g for 1 min at 4°C.\nRemove the Amicon® Ultra-0.5 filter and place a 2 mL Eppendorf tube over top and invert. Centrifuge at 1,000×g for 2 min at 4°C.\nAdd purified axoplasm to the exchange device and centrifuge 4,000×g for 30 min at 4°C in a swinging bucket rotor.\nAfter sample concentration, add 500 μL denaturation buffer to the exchange device. Centrifuge at 4,000×g for 2 h at 4°C. The final volume should be about 30 μL.\nRemove the Amicon® Ultra-0.5 filter and place a collection tube which is provided in the Purification System over the top and invert. Centrifuge at 1,000×g for 2 min at 4°C.",
    "Store the concentrated samples at −80°C for the Mass Spectrometry analysis.\nCritical: In step 23, after 2 h centrifugation, check sample volume, if the volume is more than 30 μL, increase the centrifuge time until the final volume is about 30 μL. In step 24, when removing the Amicon® Ultra-0.5 filter from the exchange device, depress the cap at the same time to expel the remaining sample that is held by the exchange device tip into the filter.\nPause point: Stop here. Proceed to the mass spectrometry experiment after collecting the axoplasm samples from all the groups.\nMass spectrometry sample preparation\nTiming: ∼ 1 day\nThis section describes the steps of axoplasm protein sample preparation for mass spectrometry.\nHeat the axoplasm samples at 70°C for 10 min in 1× NuPAGE LDS Sample Buffer with 100 mM DTT. 20 ug protein is loaded per sample.\nAfter, separate proteins on 10% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel in MES running buffer for 10 min at 180 V.\nFix the gel in 7% acetic acid containing 40% methanol for 15 min.\nStain the gel using the Colloidal Blue Staining Kit for 30 min.\nAfter staining, cut the lanes containing proteins from the gel.\nChop the gel slices and collect them in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Incubate with 1 mL 50% ethanol in 25 mM NH4HCO3 at 20°C–22°C with rotating followed by several rounds of exchange until destained.\nRemove destain buffer, dehydrate the gel pieces in 100% acetonitrile for 10 min with rotating until they are white and compact.\nRemove the supernatant, dry sample gel pieces with the vacuum (using Vacuum centrifuge).\nRehydrate and reduce the vacuum-dried samples in 150 μL reduction buffer (10 mM DTT in 50 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0) for 60 min at 56°C.",
    "Remove buffer, add 150 μL 50 mM iodoacetamide in 50 mM NH4HCO3, pH 8.0 and incubate at dark for 45 min at 20°C–22°C.\nWash gel pieces once in 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0.\nRemove the solution and repeat steps 32 and 33, then add 160 μL trypsin digestion buffer (1 μg trypsin per sample in 50 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0) and incubate 1–12 h at 37°C.\nCritical: Remove all acetonitrile before trypsinization to ensure the complete digestion of proteins.\nPeptides extraction, purification, and desalting\nTiming: ∼ 1 day\nPeptides are extracted, purified, and desalted in this section.\nCollect the supernatant which contains the protein peptides to a new Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 100 μL 30% acetonitrile extraction solution to the gel pieces and incubate for 15 min at 20°C–22°C with shaking at 1,400 rpm.\nCollect the supernatant and combine it with the solution obtained in step 38.\nRepeat steps 39 and 40.\nAdd 100 μL 100% acetonitrile and incubate at 20°C–22°C for 15 min with sharking at 1,400 rpm.\nCollect the supernatant and combine it with the previous supernatant.\nRepeat steps 42 and 43.\nReduce supernatant volume with vacuum to remove acetonitrile until ∼100 μL is left.\nPerform reductive methylation labeling for quantification as described previously (Hsu et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nAfter labeling, purify peptides using C18 StageTips as described in (Rappsilber et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nActivate and equilibrate C18 material with 50 μL each 100% methanol, 80% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid and 0.1% formic acid before loading peptides.\nLoad peptides supernatant.\nWash with 0.1% formic acid.\nElute the peptides in 30 μL 80% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid and dry it with vacuum.\nReconstitute peptides in 14 μL of 0.1% formic acid.",
