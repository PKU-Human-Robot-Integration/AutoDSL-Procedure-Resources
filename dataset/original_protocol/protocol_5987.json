    "Ultrasound guided intra-thymic injectionPick up one mouse and place in the acrylic chamber connected to an isoflurane vaporizer (Figures 1A and 1B). We normally use the mouse ranges from 6 to 10 weeks of age. Induce anesthesia using the acrylic chamber with 3% of isoflurane in O2 administered at a rate of 600 ml/min into the chamber (Figure 1B).Frequently check the anesthesia state of the mouse; the mouse should be anesthetized within 3 min.Take mouse out of the chamber and quickly transfer to the immobilization heating pad, cover the mouse nose with a facemask to maintain anesthesia with 3% of isoflurane in O2 administered at a rate of 600 ml/min (Figure 1C).Apply eye ointment on both eyes to prevent them from drying during anesthesia period.Flip the mouse belly up and immobilize limbs with medical tape, during which the mouse should be maintained under anesthesia with the facemask (Figure 1C).Apply Nair on chest area, wait for 1-2 min to effect, remove hair with a paper towel. Swipe the chest area with betadine and clean up with an alcohol pad to sterilize the area.Apply ultrasound gel on the chest area and then perform the ultrasound scan using the Vevo® 2100 Imaging System (Visual Sonics) with the MS550 transducer, which ranges from 32 to 40 MHz. Fix the transducer right above the chest area in direct contact with ultrasound gel; the live ultrasound imaging should be as shown, while the syringe will approach the thymus from the side of chest (Figures 1C and 1D).Identify the thymus in the ultrasound image as shown in Figure 1D.",
    "Fill the syringe (29G1/2 needle) with 10-20 µl of NHS-biotin at 1 mg/ml in PBS or with cell suspension, tightly fix the syringe in the syringe stand on the right side of the animal and adjust to approximate 135° angle point from the ground (Figure 1C).First, approach the needle into the gel between mouse and transducer until clearly visualized in the ultrasound imaging as a high-density white dot (Figure 1E). Then, slide the syringe up and down to target the needle directly above the thymus (Figure 1E).Pull the needle out of the gel, lower the syringe (till the needle tip points to the chest area), advance the needle into the mouse through the ribs and continuously penetrate toward the thymus. Frequently monitor the ultrasound image until the needle tip is visualized within the area of thymus (Figure 1F), perform injection, then pull the needle out of the mouse.After injection, remove the ultrasound gel using a cotton pad and wipe the chest area clean with an alcohol pad. Remove medical tape restraints on mouse limbs, remove mouse from nose cone and place the mouse back in the cage for recovery. The mouse should recover in 2-3 min and behave similar to before injection. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181128/20181128180031_3999.jpgFigure 1.

    "The white dashed line outlines the thymus; the yellow arrow indicates the needle penetrating inside the thymus during injection. G. Image for the localization of thymus in the chest cavity of mouse. The yellow arrow indicates the thymus.Track recent thymic emigrants (RTEs) in the peripheryTo track RTEs, perform intra-thymic injection of NHS-biotin as described in Procedure A. Euthanize the mouse 24-72 h later, collect the thymus (Figure 1G) in ice cold FACS buffer and spleen in ice cold MACS buffer.Prepare single cell suspension from the thymus and spleen by mashing the tissues with the plunger of a 3 ml syringe and passing cell suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer.Determine the cell count of each sample using hemacytometer.In accordance with the Miltenyi protocol, resuspend spleen cells in 80 μl of MACS buffer per 107 cells, add 20 μl of Anti-Biotin MicroBeads per 107 cells. Vortex to mix well and incubate for 45 min in the refrigerator (2-8 °C).Wash cells with 2 ml of MACS buffer per 107 cells and centrifuge to pellet at 300 x g for 10 min. Aspirate supernatant.After wash, resuspend cell pellet with 500 μl of MACS buffer up to 108 cells.Proceed to the magnetic enrichment of biotin+ cells using LS columns according to the Miltenyi protocol.Collect the flowthrough and bound fraction of cells and perform flow cytometry to identify biotin+ cells through staining with streptavidin-PE or streptavidin-BV421. Developmental outcome of transferred progenitorsPerform intra-thymic injection of sorted or purified cells of choice into congenically distinct recipient mice as described in Procedure A to study T cell development in the thymus. In our hands, we successfully transferred invariant natural killer T (iNKT) progenitor cells, T regulatory (Treg) progenitor cells and DN thymocytes, and monitored their differentiation into iNKT effector subsets, mature Treg cells, and mature SP thymocytes, respectively.",
    "Briefly, sort the iNKT progenitors from thymocytes of T-betGFP/KN2 mice, Treg progenitors from thymocytes of Foxp3GFP mice with a FACS sorter, or purify and enrich the DN thymocytes using LS column by depleting CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+ CD8+ thymocytes of B6 mice. More details concerning the background of iNKT cell and Treg cell development, as well as gating and sorting strategies of their precursors were shown in the original research paper (Wang and Hogquist, 2018; Owen et al., 2018).Wash the sorted or purified cells 2 times with 10 ml of PBS and centrifuge to pellet at 300 x g for 10 min. Aspirate supernatant.After the second wash, resuspend cell pellet in about 20 μl of PBS, keep cell suspension on ice before injection.Perform the intra-thymic injection of the cell suspension as described in Procedure A.Euthanize the mouse after the injection (experimental end points should be determined empirically for each study), collect the thymus in ice cold FACS buffer.Prepare single cell suspension from the thymus by mashing the tissues with the plunger of a 3 ml syringe and passing cell suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer.Perform flow cytometry to identify the transferred cells through staining of the congenic markers (CD45.1 and CD45.2) and/or other related cell markers."
