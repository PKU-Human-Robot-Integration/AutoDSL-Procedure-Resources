    "The following protocol follows the animal care and ethics guidelines provided by Utah State University.\n1. Media preparation\nPrior to oocyte handling, prepare the following solutions, as described in Table 1: 400 µL of Hyaluronidase Solution, 500 µL of T2 media, 1,020 µL of T20 media, and 800 µL of T10 media.\nDivide the T10 media into two wells of a four-well plate, 400 µL per well. Label one well with \"M\" and the second well with \"MR.\" Place in a 5% CO2 incubator until after bisection.\nPrepare 500 µL of Cytochalasin B (CB)/Synthetic Oviductal Fluid with HEPES (HSOF). Aliquot 50 µL of CB/HSOF solution into a separate 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nPrepare 40 µL of Pronase Solution. Centrifuge for at least 30 s at 2,680 x g. Mix 20 µL of the supernatant with 20 µL of T2 to a new centrifuge tube; this forms a diluted, 5 mg/mL pronase solution.\nPrepare 3 mL of HSOF. On a search plate, separately deposit four 400 µL drops; place this plate under a stereomicroscope.\nPrepare 500 µL of CB/T20 solution.\n2. In vitro maturation (IVM) of bovine oocytes\nIVM: Culture aspirated cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) at 38.5 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 21 h in a four-well dish of maturation media containing 10% FBS, 0.26 IU/mL FSH, and 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin.\nPerform the following steps to denude the oocytes.\n\t\nCollect the desired number of the COCs using a 200 µL pipette, and deposit them at the bottom of a 1.5 µL centrifuge tube.\nAdd the same volume of 0.6 mg/mL hyaluronidase to the centrifuge tube with the oocytes (i.e., if the volume of oocytes and IVM media is 100 µL, add 100 µL of hyaluronidase).",
    "Pipette the solution up and down without creating bubbles, until all the cumulus cells have been removed.\nCheck the maturation of the oocytes.\n\t\nUse the pipette to add 200 µL of HSOF from one of the four HSOF drops on the search plate to the oocyte/hyaluronidase solution.\nTransfer the oocytes from the hyaluronidase/HSOF drop and place them in unused 400 µL of HSOF drop. Wash them with two additional HSOF drops to assist in removing hyaluronidase and cumulus cell remnants.\nUsing a mouth pipette (or a 10 µL pipette and tip) and high microscopic magnification, roll and select the oocytes based on polar body presence.\nAfter sorting the oocytes, collect the desired number of MII oocytes to be bisected, and place them in 400 µL of HSOF drop.\n\t\tNOTE: If the oocytes have been outside of the incubator for longer than 30 min, oocytes may be placed back into a well of maturation media and placed in a CO2-controlled incubator to rest for at least 30 min. Limit the number of oocytes to be bisected to an amount that is feasible to finish bisecting in approximately 30 min to minimize time outside of incubation. If ooplasts are to be fused with a somatic cell, activated, and cultured as embryos, oocytes should be enucleated at this time.\n3. Centrifugation of the oocytes\nNOTE: If oocytes were placed in the incubator in maturation media, move them to the HSOF drop from which they were most recently collected.\nUsing a mouth pipette, collect the selected mature oocytes from the HSOF drop, and place them into the 1.5 mL tube containing 50 µL of the HSOF/CB solution. Centrifuge the oocytes at 15,000 x g for 12 min.\n\tNOTE: It is not detrimental for bubbles to be present in the centrifuge tube.",
    "While the oocytes are being centrifuged, prepare the bisection plate.\n\t\nMake the pattern as shown in Figure 1 on the lid of a 60 mm petri dish (20 µL per drop), and fully cover the drops with mineral oil.\nUsing a thin-tipped marker, mark the lines underneath the dish, as shown in Figure 2.\n\t\t\nDraw a box around the pronase drop and a line between the CB/T20 drops and the bottom row of T20 drops.\nCover the dish with an opaque lid until centrifugation is complete to prevent osmolarity changes of microdrops.\nAs soon as centrifugation is complete, use a 200 µL pipette to collect the oocytes within the solution, and move them into an empty portion of a new search plate with four 400 µL HSOF drops.\nCollect and wash the oocytes through the four HSOF drops.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64060/64060fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Bisection plate. All drops shown have a 20 µL volume. The plate has a diameter of 60 mm. Drops have been completely covered with mineral oil. Oocytes will first be placed in the uppermost and leftmost T2 drop (indicated here with a star). PRO/T2: 10 µL of pronase and 10 µL of T2, combined prior to creating microdrops. CB/T20: 1 µL of cytochalasin B per 1 mL of T20, combined prior to creating microdrops.

    "NOTE: The following process involves preparation of the oocytes for bisection.\nTurn the heating stage on to 37 °C.\nUse a mouth pipette to move the centrifuged oocytes from the HSOF drop to the top left T2 drop of the bisection plate, then wash the oocytes through the next three drops on the top row (T2, T20, T20).\nDeposit the oocytes in one of the pronase drops, assuring there is little to no contact between them.\n\tNOTE: The removal of the zona pellucida can take varying amounts of time, but typically occurs between 30-120 s with the use of a heating stage. The absence of a heating stage will extend this time.\nObserve the oocytes until there is clear deformation of the zonae pellucidae (see Figure 3).\nOnce a single oocyte zona pellucida has become deformed, move that oocyte to the neighboring T2 drop. Repeat as additional oocytes become deformed, until all oocytes have been removed from the pronase and placed in the T2 drop.\nObserve the oocytes until only a thin layer of the zone pellucida remains.\nWash the oocytes through the next three drops within the row (T2, T20, T20), then deposit them in vertical lines within the CB/T20 drops (see Figure 4).\n\t\nBegin with fewer oocytes in the vertical lines and increase the number of oocytes per drop as bisection skills progress.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64060/64060fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Removal of zona pellucida using pronase. (80x) An oocyte zona pellucida will begin to appear deformed when the pronase has affected the zona pellucida enough for the oocyte to be moved to the adjacent T2 drop.

Bisection of the oocytes\nFocus on the first, left-most CB/T20 (bisection) drop that contains oocytes, and use a mouth pipette to rotate the oocytes, so that the mitochondria-dense portion of each oocyte is either facing toward or away from the microscope's arm.\n\tNOTE: The mitochondria-dense portion will not contain lipids, which appear as the darkest portion of the oocyte following centrifugation.\nRest the tip of the microblade to the left of the topmost oocyte, in line with the space directly above the mitochondria-dense portion. Keeping the tip of the blade in the same place, carefully lower the blade to cut all the way through the oocyte.\n\t\nEnsure that the mitochondria-dense ooplast and mitochondria-reduced ooplast are similar in size; bisection should cut each oocyte in half to produce two ooplasts.\n\t\tNOTE: Comparative sizes of ooplasts produced from a single oocyte may vary based on research goals; if mitochondria-reduced ooplasts are to be fused with a somatic cell, their volume should be greater than the mitochondria-dense ooplasts'.\nEnsure that the blade is bisecting the oocyte above the mitochondria-dense portion and below the lipid-dense portion, in the clearest segment of the centrifuged oocyte.\nWhen lifting the blade, ensure that the same line is maintained, and that the tip of the blade remains in same place, then gently lift the tip from the plate.\nRepeat bisection steps for all oocytes within the first bisection drop. If oocytes are present in additional drops, orient and bisect the remaining oocytes.",
    "Using a mouth pipette, collect mitochondria-reduced ooplasts from the first bisection drop. Place them in the left-hand T20 drop located in the bottom row of the plate. Repeat for all remaining bisection drops.\n\tNOTE: Mitochondria-reduced ooplasts will contain lipids, that are darker in color than the rest of the oocyte.\nUsing a mouth pipette, collect mitochondria-dense ooplasts from the first bisection drop. Place them in the right-hand T20 drop located in the bottom row of the plate. Repeat for all remaining bisection drops.\n\tNOTE: Mitochondria-dense regions will have a visible conglomeration of organelles that will be light gray in appearance.\nRetrieve the T10 four-well dish from the incubator. Using a mouth pipette, move all mitochondria-reduced ooplasts to the well labeled \"MR,\" and move the mitochondria-dense ooplasts to the well labeled \"M.\"\nPlace the four-well plate back into the CO2-controlled incubator. Allow ooplasts to rest for at least 30 min prior to quantification of mtDNA.\n6. Quantification of mtDNA\nUse a DNA extraction kit designed to extract material from a small sample to extract DNA from individual samples (single oocytes, single mitochondria-dense ooplasts, single mitochondria-depleted ooplasts).\nUse a DNA quantification method of the choice to ensure that DNA was successfully extracted from each sample. If quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) will not be completed at that time, freeze the extracted DNA in a labeled tube in a -80 °C freezer.\nPerform qPCR\n\t\nRefer to Table 2 to determine the volume of each reagent to add to each qPCR tube, along with the primer sequences. These primers are designed to amplify the 12S region of bovine mtDNA.",
    "Set the initial denaturation time for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of: 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 15 s of annealing at 60 °C, and 15 s of extension at 72 °C. When the reaction is complete, record the cycle threshold (Ct) values.\n\t\tNOTE: In order to obtain relative mtDNA copy number values, a standard curve must be produced using samples with known quantities of mtDNA copy numbers, that increase exponentially. The cycle threshold values then need to be manipulated using the following formulas to determine relative mtDNA copy numbers.\nObtain the concentration of the DNA using the equation below:\n\t\tConcentration of DNA = (10(Ct-intercept/slope)) x tested volume\nObtain the copy number using the equation below:\n\t\tCopy number = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64060/64060eq01.jpg\nObtain the copy number using the equation below:\n\t\tCopy number per cell = 2 x imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64060/64060eq02.jpg\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64060/64060fig05.jpg\nFigure 5: Somatic cell mtDNA standard curve. This standard curve was created through the mtDNA quantification of logarithmic concentrations of bovine somatic cells using the qPCR reagents and program as described in protocol step 6.3.
