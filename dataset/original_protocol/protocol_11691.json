    "All experiments involving the differentiation of human iPSC lines were performed in compliance with the Institutional Review Board of Boston University (protocol H33122). The dermal fibroblasts, procured for reprogramming to iPSCs, were obtained from a donor with written informed consent, under the approval of the Human Research Protection Office of Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO. Reprogrammed iPSCs were generated at the Center for Regenerative Medicine at Boston University and Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA.\n1. Alveolosphere dissociation\nPrepare complete serum-free differentiation media (cSFDM) as per the composition mentioned in Table 1.\nPrepare CK + DCI media in the prepared cSFDM base as per Table 2.\nThaw 2D (human embryonic stem cell-qualified) and/or 3D (growth-factor reduced) matrix on ice as required for the experimental needs.\nAspirate all the CK + DCI medium using a pipette or aspirating pipette with vacuum from the 3D matrix droplets containing alveolospheres, derived from directed differentiation19, in a 12-well plate.\nAdd 1 mL of dispase (2 mg/mL) per droplet. Gently pipette the droplet into the dispase using a P1000 pipette. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h, pipetting up and down once after 30 min.\nTransfer the dissociated organoids (from Step 1.5) from one matrix droplet in the dispase to a 15 mL conical tube. To wash, add 10 mL of Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM, see Table of Materials).\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant using a pipette or aspirating pipette with vacuum, leaving as little supernatant as possible.",
    "NOTE: It is important to remove all dispase as any remaining dispase may dissolve the matrix that the cells will subsequently be seeded into. If a clear haze is seen above the pellet, the dispase has not completely dissolved the matrix, and more dispase can be added to the pellet for another 20-30 min at 37 °C.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin per droplet and transfer back to the 12-well plate. Incubate at 37 °C for 12-15 min. Observe the dissociation under a microscope. Avoid over-pipetting the cells at this stage.\n\tNOTE: At the end of incubation, the cells need to achieve a single-cell suspension after pipetting 3-5 times with a P1000 pipette. For passaging iAT2s to ALI (Step 3), the trypsinization time needs to be minimized (maximum 12 min), such that the cells are in 2-3-cell clumps rather than single-cell suspension when ready for plating onto the cell culture insert.\nStop the action of trypsin with an equal volume of FBS-containing medium (10% ES-qualified FBS in DMEM). Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nWash the cells with 10 mL of IMDM. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nResuspend the cells in an appropriate volume for counting, and then count the cells using a hemocytometer (see Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: From one confluent 50 µL matrix droplet seeded at 400 cells/µL, the expected yield is 500,000 to 1.5 x 106 cells per droplet.\nUse the single-cell suspension of iAT2 cells to generate alveolospheres by plating in the 3D matrix (Step 2) and/or plating on cell culture inserts for ALI culture (Step 3).\n2. 3D plating of iAT2s",
    "After counting (Step 1.11), determine the number of desired cells to replate in the 3D matrix (400 cells/µL of the matrix with 50-100 µL of 3D matrix droplets per well of a 12-well plate). Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Remove as much supernatant as possible using a pipette.\nResuspend the cells in the 3D matrix. Resuspend quickly and on ice, if needed, to prevent the matrix from polymerizing (which occurs when warm).\nUse a P200 pipette to dispense one 3D matrix droplet per well into a pre-warmed 12-well plate. Pipette carefully to avoid creating bubbles in the matrix droplet. Do not allow the cell suspension to settle while dispensing multiple droplets.\nPlace the plate in a 37 °C incubator for 20-30 min to allow the matrix droplets to polymerize.\nAdd 1 mL of CK + DCI + 10 µM of Y-27632 medium (see Table of Materials) per well to cover the matrix droplet.\nAfter 72 h, change the medium to CK + DCI without 10 µM of Y-27632.\nReplace the medium with fresh CK + DCI every 48-72 h.\n\t​NOTE: iAT2s will typically need to be passaged approximately every 10-14 days, depending on cell line and plating density.\n3. Passaging of iAT2s to ALI\nPrepare freshly coated 6.5 mm cell culture inserts 1 h before use by diluting the 2D matrix in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12) to working solution as per manufacturer's instructions for the 2D matrix (see Table of Materials). Then, add 100 µL of the diluted matrix per 6.5 mm cell culture insert. Allow the matrix to polymerize in a 37 °C incubator for 30 min or at room temperature for 1 h.",
    "Aspirate the excess matrix from the cell culture inserts using a pipette or aspirating pipette with vacuum and rinse once with DMEM/F12. Aspirate this wash immediately before adding the cells.\nAfter counting, determine the number of required cells to seed the desired number of cells in the culture inserts (520,000 live cells/cm2, equivalent to 172,000 live cells per 6.5 mm cell culture insert). Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature. Remove as much supernatant as possible.\nResuspend the cells in the appropriate volume to seed with 100 µL of CK + DCI + 10 µM Y-27632 per cell culture insert (cell suspension should be 1,720 cells/µL ). Add 100 µL to the apical compartment of the cell culture insert. Gently agitate the plate in a cross-pattern to ensure an even distribution of cells across the cell culture insert, and confirm this by checking under a microscope at 4x objective.\n\tNOTE: Seeding density is critical and may require optimization, ranging from 160,000-300,000 cells per 6.5 mm cell culture insert. Calcein green (see Table of Materials) cell-permeable dye may be added to the cells and viewed on an inverted fluorescent microscope to visualize the cells after seeding.\nAdd 500 µL of CK + DCI + 10 µM of Y-27632 to the basolateral compartment of each cell culture insert.\nAspirate apical CK + DCI + 10 µM of Y-27632 medium 48 h after seeding using a pipette to initiate ALI (known as \"air-lift\").\n\tNOTE: The cells should be 100% confluent at this point. If the cells are not 100% confluent, Steps 3.7-3.8 should still be performed at the indicated time points; confluent cell monolayers may take longer to form.",
    "Change the basolateral CK + DCI + 10 µM of Y-27632 medium after 72 h to CK + DCI without 10 µM Y-27632.\n\tNOTE: There should be minimal if any, \"leak\" of medium to the apical side. However, if this does occur in the first few days, continue to aspirate the apical side daily until there is no further leakage.\nReplace the basolateral medium with fresh CK + DCI every 48-72 h.\n\tNOTE: The iAT2s used in ALI cultures are maximally matured at 5-14 days post-plating.\nMaintain the cells with careful monitoring for up to 28 days post-plating, if needed, for more prolonged experimentation.\n\tNOTE: Visible signs of ALI failure, such as peeling of the cells away from the edge of the insert or formation of holes in the monolayer, may be observed after an overextended time in culture, at which point the ALI is no longer usable for experiments."
