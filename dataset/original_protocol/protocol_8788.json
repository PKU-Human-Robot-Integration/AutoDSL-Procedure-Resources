    "The procedure was done in accordance with the NIH standards for care and use of laboratory animals and was approved by the Tel-Aviv University Animal Care and Use Committee (permit number – L-14-019).\n1. Preparation of Instruments and PDMS\nPrepare the wafer (Table of Materials, or order the wafer from a microfabrication lab), a scalpel, and a pair of tweezers – sterilization is not needed.\nMake poly-D-lysine (PDL) solution according to the following conditions: 4 mg/ml in 0.1 M borate buffer, pH 8, and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare PDMS stencils according to the following procedure:\n\t\nPrepare polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, silicone elastomer) by mixing together the base and the curing agent with a ratio of 10:1, then stir the 2 substances for approximately 5 min.\nPlace in vacuum chamber twice for 15 min each time and verify bubbles are gone.\nWhen the PDMS is ready, prepare spin coater: open nitrogen knobs to allow gas usage, place the silicon wafer (Figure 1A) on spinner, and use the vacuum to prevent it from moving.\nPour PDMS over wafer and activate the spinner for 1 min at 1,000 rpm (creates approximately 100 µm height).\nPlace wafer on a hot plate at 100 °C for 30 min.\nWhen the PDMS has hardened, outline the stencil's borders with PDMS, using Pasteur pipette. Place wafer on a hot plate at 100 °C for 30 min.\nWhen the PDMS borders have hardened, use a scalpel to cut stencils according to the borders and peel off the silicon stencil from the wafer (a squared PDMS containing a single pattern).\n2. Petri Dish and Cover Slip Preparation\nPrepare 23 mm square glass cover slips and clean them according to the following order:\n\t\nWash with distilled water, 70% ethanol, and acetone.\nWash with isopropanol and fast dry with nitrogen.",
    "Place patterned PDMS stencils on coverslip, and gently press to verify that they are firmly attached to the glass surface. Place in vacuum chamber for 15 min.\nDrop 1 ml of PDL on stencil. Insert the coverslip into the vacuum chamber twice for 20 min each time, and leave PDL O/N to dry.\nPrepare Petri dish to create a supporting cell network:\n\t\nCover the surface of the dish (3.5 cm) with 1 ml of PDL for 2 hr in RT. Remove the PDL drop using a pipette.\nWash with distilled water and leave to dry. Place a very small drop of silicone grease on each corner of the coverslip.\nPlace the coverslip on the center of the Petri dish (i.e., the PDMS should be facing up) and press gently to verify attachment.\nGently remove PDMS from coverslip using tweezers. For sterilization, expose to UV illumination for 7 min.\n3. Multi-Electrode Array (MEA) Preparation\nClean MEA in this order (Table of Materials):\n\t\nWash with water under tap and sonicate in a concentrated, enzymatic detergent 3 times.\nSonicate in distilled water 3 times.\nWash with distilled water (in hood, 1,000 µl tip) for 3 times and place under UV for 30 min.\nSupporting network preparation:\n\t\nPrepare the designed support network mold.\n\t\t\nPour PDMS into a 12-well plate (22 mm diameter).\nWhen the PDMS is hardened take out the mold and using a scalpel, cut a hole in the middle to create a ring shape.\nPlace a designed support network mold on the center of the MEA (Figure 2A) and cover the rest of the surface with PDL for 2 hr at RT.\nRemove PDL using pipette and wash with distilled water.\nRemove the mold and leave to dry (Figure 2A).\nAlign stencil to MEA in the following way:",
    "Place stencil on designated micro manipulator. Use an inverted microscope to accurately align patterned structure to electrodes, and lower the stencil until it is placed on the MEA surface (Figure 2B).\n\t\tNote: Contact with a well cleaned MEA provides competitive adhesion between the PDMS and the MEA itself.\nLift the micromanipulator and if needed, use tweezers to apply a small amount of pressure above the PDMS to prevent it detaching from the MEA.\nGently press stencil to MEA surface, and use microscope to verify it is firmly attached, and well aligned. (Figure 2C-D).\nPlace MEA in vacuum chamber for 15 min; put a 1 ml drop of PDL on stencil.\nInsert into vacuum chamber 2 times for 20 min each. Leave PDL to dry O/N in the incubator.\nBefore plating, remove the PDMS stencils from MEAs and wash using sterile water. Place under UV illumination for 7 min.\n4. Dissection and Culture\nPrepare cultures as described in Herzog et al. 2011 21.\n5. Plating\nCalculate number of cells needed for plating, using a hemocytometer (optimal density according to the size of the circuit as discussed in the result).\n\t\nMake sure the counting chamber (hemocytometer) is clean and place a cover slip on it (use alcohol to clean).\nDilute 10 µl of the cell suspension in 190 µl of plating medium (dilution 1:20).\nLoad 10 µl of the diluted cells onto the edge of the counting chamber and slowly pipette the cells out allowing the chamber to fill itself.\nUsing an inverted microscope, visualise the haemocytometer grid. Determine the number of cells in the chamber by direct counting (healthy cells should be round). Count the cells within the large square without those crossing the edges.\nCalculate the concentration of cells:",
    "Total number of cells/1000 µl = Total cells counted × dilution factor × 104 (area of the hemocytometer).\n\t\tNote: For example, if the dilution factor was 20 and the total cells counted were 100:\n\t\t100 × 20 × 104 = 0.1 x 107 cells/1,000 µl or 1 x 106/100 µl. In order to plate 0.75 x 106 cells, take 75 µl out of the cells.\nTake the number of cells needed for plating per single MEA or Petri dish, resuspend the cells to prevent aggregation, and plate them at the center, on top of the patternate area (if needed, it is possible to dilute the cells in the medium). For the MEA, place a 100 µl drop in the middle. For cover slip, place a 1,000 µl drop in the middle.\nIncubate the plated cells at 37 °C for 40 min. Add plating medium to the plated cells, up to 1 ml per MEA and 2 ml per cover slip.\nKeep at 37 °C and, every 4 days, dilute with fresh growth medium enriched with 0.5 Pen-Strep, 2% B-27 and 0.75% glutamax.\nFrom 6/7 DIV, after seeing connections between the islands, dilute medium with 10 µl/ml FUDR (25 mg deoxyuridine + 62.5 mg uridine in 12.5 ml MEM (Minimum Essential Medium Eagle)) or any other anti-mitotic agent to prevent glial overgrowth.\nSubscription Required.
