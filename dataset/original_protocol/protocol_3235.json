    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\n      For both assays, cells need to be infected following steps 1–14. For\n      quantifying infection by the FISH-flow assay, follow steps 15–23, and for\n      evaluating the infection with the morphological RNAscope assay, follow\n      steps 24–57.\n    \nInfection of Vero cells\nTiming: 24 h\n      In this step, Vero cells are incubated with various amounts of infectious\n      virus with indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) ranging from 0.01 to\n      0.00001, thus including a condition with low infectious virus\n      concentration (< 10 infectious virus/mL), not detectable in techniques\n      such as plaque forming assays or RT-qPCR, this later one being sensitive\n      but unable to discriminate infectious from non-infectious virus.\n    \n      This protocol applies to the detection of low levels of infectious virus\n      produced by different cells in ex vitro or in vitro culture\n      systems.\n    \n        Seed cells in D10 in a 96-flat well plate so that a layer of confluent\n        cells can be infected with the virus on the day of infection (usually\n        50,000 cells/well the day before). Anticipate having at least 3\n        replicates per dilution of virus tested and per sample in order to\n        ensure robustness of the detection.\n      \n        Perform 10-fold serial dilutions of viral stocks or biological samples\n        in DMEM supplemented with Penicillin/streptomycin (100 U/mL) and 2% FCS\n        (D2).\n      \nCritical: Addition of 1% final\n      TPCK-treated trypsin might increase detection of infectious particles from\n      biological samples in Vero E6 cells that lack expression of the protease\n      TMPRSS2.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nInfect cells with 50 μL viral dilution for 1–3 h at 37°C.\nReplace inoculum with 100 μL fresh pre-warmed D2.\nIncubate Vero cells for 24 h at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nWash two times Vero cells with PBS-FISH.\n        Detach Vero cells by incubating them in Trypsin 0.05% v/v solution for\n        5 min at 37°C, 5% CO2.\n        \nAdd 50 μL trypsin/well.",
