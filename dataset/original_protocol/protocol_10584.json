    "1. Cell Preparation\nPlate 1×105 cells/ml of metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 in a volume of 10 ml per tissue culture T75 flask in Leibovitz’s L-15 Medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.\nIncubate MDA-MB-231 cells in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 0% CO2 environment.\nHarvest cells for experiments 2 days after seeding by treating cells with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 2 min and inactivate trypsin’s enzymatic activity by adding 8 ml of the growth media.\nPellet cells by centrifuging for 5 min at 200 × g and resuspend in Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS, 1x, without Ca2+ and Mg2+) to a final concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml.\n2. Device Design and Fabrication\nNOTE: The mask, master mold fabrications and the microchannel enclosing process are to be conducted inside a clean room while the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannel casting process can be performed on a regular laboratory benchtop.\nDesign a microfluidic device as illustrated in Figure 1 with AutoCAD. The device should consist of an inlet with multiple injection ports, coarse filters and two parallel straight rectangular inertial focusing channels (L = 7 mm, W = 40 μm, and H = 70 μm). Individual straight channel consists of 5 electroporation chambers, which are placed 800 μm apart (WC = 400 μm) with two via holes for aluminum electrodes. Two transversally adjacent electroporation chambers share the hole for the negative electrode. Two straight channels merge into an outlet at the downstream of the electroporation region.",
    "Convert the CAD file with micro-patterns to a GDSII file using LinkCAD. Write the micro-patterns on a 5” x 5” photomask blank using a laser mask writer. Develop the mask by following the manufacturer’s protocol. NOTE: The mask development process includes photoresist developing, chrome etching and resist removal. Alternatively, micro-patterns printed on a high resolution transparency (>20,000 dpi) can be purchased from a third party manufacturer and used as a photomask. Final microscale features on a photomask should be transparent to match the polarity of a negative photoresist.\nFabricate the casting mold of the device design using standard soft lithography techniques23 with a negative photoresist spun coat on a 4 inch silicon wafer at 2,000 rpm to have the final thickness of 70 μm.\nPrebake the wafer with negative photoresist for 20 min at 95 °C.\nContact the mask with the wafer and expose to a UV source (17.4 mJ/cm2) for 80 sec using a mask aligner.\nDevelop the exposed wafer for 4 min in a SU-8 developer.\nMeasure the developed photoresist thickness using a surface profilometer.\nRigorously mix a 10:1 ratio of elastomer to curing agent (silicone elastomer kit) and pour the mixture on the casting mold to generate PDMS replicas. Degas the casting elastomer for 30 min and cure the casting mold with degassed elastomer in an oven at 70 °C for 2 hr.\nDelaminate cured PDMS replica with microchannel patterns from the mold and punch holes for inlets, outlet and electrode insertions using a pin vise. NOTE: The normal cutting edge diameter of the pin vise should be 0.76 mm, adequate for tightly holding PEEK tubing (O.D. of 1/32”) and aluminum electrodes (O.D. of 0.029”) in place.",
    "Create enclosed microfluidic channels by bonding PDMS replicas to a glass slide treated in an oxygen-plasma cleaner for 7 sec at a radio frequency power and oxygen partial pressure of 75 W and 500 mTorr, respectively.\n3. Flow Experiments\nInsert aluminum electrodes (0.029” OD) and an outlet PEEK tubing (1/32” OD) into designated places via holes in the microchannel (see Figure 3B).\nConnect the electrical equipment18 responsible for generating high-voltage short square-wave pulses to the aluminum electrodes (see Figure 3C) that are in contact with flowing solutions in the PDMS mold. NOTE: The equipment should consist of a pulse generator and an in-house built high voltage amplifier.18\nPrepare four 50 ml centrifuge tubes individually containing DPBS, solutions with cells and biomolecules, and attach each tube to its respective vial holder connected to the pneumatic flow control system (see Figure 3A).18\nConnect inlet PEEK tubing from the vial holders into the respective inlet holes in the microfluidic device.\nSet the magnitude of square-wave pulses, V, to 100 V in order to have the electric field strength, E =V/Le, across the electroporation chamber be equivalent to 0.7 kV/cm. NOTE: Here, Le is the distance between two points where the positive and negative electrodes are in contact with the flowing solution (see Figure 1).\nSet the pressure regulator to 40 psi. NOTE: A single manually adjustable nitrogen source is used to uniformly pressurize all sample vials and a high-speed manifold is utilized to timely activate individual solution ports using the custom-built LabVIEW software.18\nFor valve control, open the custom-built LabVIEW software labeled Valve Runner, and click run from the dropdown menu entitled operate.",
    "Turn on valves by clicking on each corresponding valve icon. NOTE: The valve icon should turn green when it is activated. Clicking the active icon will deactivate and close the valve. The closed valve icon should turn grey.\nOpen the valve for the DPBS reservoir (i.e., washing solution) to prime the flow speed required for stable cell-trapping vortex generation for 1.5 min.\nSwitch the active solution port from the washing solution to the cell solution to trap cells in the electroporation chamber for 30 sec (i.e., the cell-trapping step).\nFlow both washing and cell solutions through the device simultaneously for 10 sec prior to the cell-trapping step to ensure undisrupted flow during the solution-switching step. NOTE: This brief co-flow step should be repeated at each solution-switching step.\nTurn on the washing port and flush the device for 20 sec in order to remove non-trapped contaminating cells.\nInject the solution containing the first molecule of interest (0.2 mg/ml of 3,000 Da neutral and anionic dextran molecules or 1.5 mg/ml of 70,000 Da neutral dextran molecule) into the device.\nApply five short pulses (Δt= 30 msec with 2 sec intervals) promptly after injection of the molecular solution and monitor the magnitude and duration of the applied electrical pulses in real-time using an oscilloscope.\nRepeat step 3.10 as many times as the number of additional molecules to be delivered. For each molecular delivery, incubate cells for 100 s in the molecular solution then flush the device with the washing solution for 100 s to remove excess molecules.\nRelease the cells in a 96-well plate for downstream analysis by lowering the operating pressure below 5 psi. NOTE: Approximately 100 μl of solution with 100 cells is collected from each release.",
    "Run the experimental steps 3.9 through 3.16 three times to collect enough cells for flow cytometry.\nCentrifuge the 96-well plate containing processed cells for 5 min at 228 × g.\nRemove the supernatant that contains excess fluorescent molecules.\nResuspend cells in DPBS for flow cytometry analysis.\nLoad cells in the flow cytometer for molecular uptake efficiency analysis.\nSubscription Required.
