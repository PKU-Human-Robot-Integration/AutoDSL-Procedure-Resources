    "This step contains information on using a collagen gel contraction assay to evaluate the effect of inhibitors and sphingosine-1-phosphate on cell contraction in a tissue like environment. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B shows a diagram of the layout of the different cell treatments. This protocol was adapted from a procedure that can be found on the manufacturer’s website: https://www.cellbiolabs.com/cell-contraction-two-step-attached-model[href=https://www.cellbiolabs.com/cell-contraction-two-step-attached-model].\nSuspend at least 7 × 106 BJ-5ta cells in fresh media at 2 × 106 cells per mL.\nIn a pre-chilled falcon tube, prepare the collagen solution on ice according to the ‘Collagen solution’ table above.\nFirst add the collagen solution and 5× medium and mix well by gently pipetting up and down.\nAdd the neutralization solution and mix immediately.\nCritical: Keep everything on ice to prevent premature polymerization of the solution. Make the solution right before plating out for the experiment.\nMake a 4:1 mixture of collagen stock solution to cells in a pre-chilled 15 mL falcon tube and mix well.\nTo 12.936 mL of collagen solution, add 3.23 mL of BJ-5ta cells in media.\nPipette up and down carefully to avoid bubbles. Do not vortex.\nPlate 500 μL of the cell collagen solution into 30 wells in two 24-well dishes.\nIncubate the cell-collagen matrix at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 1 h to allow collagen polymerization to occur.\nNote: It is difficult to determine whether polymerization is successful. Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7] shows a representative image of successful vs unsuccessful polymerization. Commonly, we discovered polymerization was unsuccessful when there was no contraction upon the addition of S1P.\nAfter 1 h, add 1 mL of prewarmed media to each well.\nCritical: Add the media very gently to prevent the matrix from detaching from the plate. Using a pipet, press the pipet tip against the wall of the well and depress the plunger slowly (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",

How to carefully add media to the wells\nA diagram showing how to correctly pipette 1 mL of media against the wall of the well onto the cell collagen matrix gently so as not to disturb the forming matrix (step 11).\nIncubate the matrix at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 30 h.\nAfter 30 h, supplement the wells with DMSO vehicle or with either 5SGlcNAc (200 μM) or Thiamet-G (10 μM).\nTreat 15 wells with DMSO vehicle and 15 wells with 5SGlcNAc/Thiamet-G.\nIncubate for an additional 16 h.\nAfter incubation, carefully aspirate the liquid media out of the well and replace the media with serum-free media containing S1P (0.1–5 μM) or no S1P as a control.\nTreat 6 wells with each concentration of S1P: 3 wells that were pre-treated with DMSO and 3 wells that were pre-treated with 5SGlcNAc.\nTreat one row of 6 wells with DMSO as control.\nInitiate contraction by gently releasing the sides and the bottom of the matrix from the plate using a 10 μL pipet tip.\nImage the wells using a ChemiDoc XRS+ molecular imager (Bio-Rad) immediately after release (t = 0). Alternatively, images can be taken with any type of imager or the matrix can be measured with a ruler.\nIncubate the matrix at 37°C for 30 min and then image the wells again (t = 30).\nQuantify the change in diameter of each matrix using ImageJ (see quantification protocol below)."
