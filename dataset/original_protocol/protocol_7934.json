  "procedures": [
    "The experiments reported in this video were conducted according to the national guidelines for the use of experimental animals, and the protocols were approved by the German governmental committees (Regierung von Oberbayern, Munich, Germany). The mice used in this study were male C57Bl/6J mice, 10-12 weeks old, and dispatched by Charles River Germany. The animals were housed under controlled temperatures (22 °C ± 2 °C), with a 12 h light-dark cycle period and access to pelleted food and water ad libitum.\n1. Preparation of the material and instruments\nDissolve Rose Bengal in 0.9% saline solution to reach a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. Connect the heat blanket to keep the operation area warm and maintain the mouse body temperature during anesthesia at 37 °C.\nPrepare scissors, forceps, pieces of cotton, dexpanthenol eye ointment, and suture material. Prepare a syringe with saline solution (without needle) to maintain the operation area hydrated. Prepare the anesthesia gas (100% O2 + isoflurane).\n2. Preparation of the animal\nInject analgesia 30 min before surgery (4 mg/kg Carprofen and 0.1 mg/kg Buprenorphine).\nRecord the mouse body weight to adjust the dose of Rose Bengal to be injected (10 µL/g i.e., 100 µg/g).\nPlace the mouse in the induction chamber with an isoflurane flow rate of 4% to anesthetize it until the spontaneous movement of the body and vibrissae stops.\nTransfer the mouse into the stereotactic frame and place it in a prone position with its nose into the anesthesia mask. Fix the animal and maintain the isoflurane concentration at 4% for 1 min. Then reduce and maintain the isoflurane concentration at 2%.\nGently insert the rectal probe to monitor the temperature throughout the surgical procedures. Set the associated feedback-controlled heating pad to maintain the mouse body temperature at 37 °C.",
    "Apply dexpanthenol eye ointment to both eyes and clean the skin and surrounding fur with a disinfectant agent.\n3. Photothrombosis model\nMake a 2.0-2.5 cm longitudinal incision and retract to expose the skull. Perform the skull exposure with a single cut to avoid wound complications.\nRemove the periosteum gently with cotton and identify the coronal sutures.\nPut on the protective glasses, switch on the 561 nm laser and mark the bregma +3 mm left.\nSwitch off the laser, attach a sticker with a 4 mm diameter hole placed at the marked coordinates mentioned above.\nInject the mouse with Bengal Rose (10 µL/g), intraperitoneally. Place the laser beam at 4-5 cm from the skull, switch on the 561 nm laser and illuminate the skull for 20 min.\nApply two drops of 0.9% saline on the skull to rehydrate, suture the wound, and place the animal in a recovery chamber at 37 °C to recover from anesthesia. After 1 h, return the mice to their cages in a temperature-controlled room.\nInject analgesia every 12 h for 3 days after surgery (4 mg/kg Carprofen and 0.1 mg/kg Buprenorphine).\n4. Sham operation\nCarry out two different procedures of Sham operations as described in steps 4.1.1 and 4.1.2.\n\t\nPerform all the procedures identically to the operation described above. Inject Rose Bengal without switching on the laser. After 20 min under anesthesia, allow the animals to stay in the recovery chamber for 1 h to recover, before being returned to their cages.\nPerform all the procedures identically to the operation described above, switching on the laser. Do not inject Rose Bengal. After 20 min of laser illumination, allow the animals to stay in the recovery chamber for 1 h to recover from anesthesia, before being returned to their cages.\n5. Laser speckle",
    "Connect the heated blanket to keep the operation area warm and maintain the mouse body temperature during anesthesia at 37 °C.\nPlace the mouse into the induction chamber with an isoflurane flow rate of 4% to anesthetize it until the spontaneous movement of the body and vibrissae stops and then transfer the mouse into the stereotactic frame.\nPlace the mouse in a prone position with its nose into the anesthesia mask. Fix the animal and maintain the isoflurane concentration at 4% for 1 min. T hen reduce and maintain it at 2%.\nGently insert the rectal probe to monitor the temperature throughout the surgical procedures. Set the associated feedback-controlled heating pad to maintain the mouse body temperature at 37 °C and apply dexpanthenol eye ointment to both eyes. Clean the skin and the surrounding fur with a disinfectant agent.\nMake a 2.0-2.5 cm longitudinal incision and retract to expose the skull. Perform the skull exposure with a single cut to avoid wound complications.\nPlace the sterotactic frame under the laser speckle and adjust the height to obtain a sharp image. Focus the laser speckle perfusion imaging (LSI) camera on the cranial window. Configure the high resolution laser speckle imaging (LSI) camera system as previously described15.\nAcquire data from a 1 cm x 1 cm field of view using a 785 nm wavelength and 80 mW lasers with a frame rate of 21 images/s at a working distance of 1 cm for 1 min.\nAfter imaging, apply two drops of 0.9% saline to the skull to rehydrate, suture the wound and place the animal in a recovery chamber at 37 °C to recover from anesthesia for 1 h. After 1 h, return the mice to their cages in a temperature-controlled room.\n6. Neuroscore",
    "NOTE: For the neurological deficit analysis, a modified neurological scale published by Eckenstein et al. in 1997 is used15.\nScore the animals for general (Table 1) and focal deficits (Table 2). This composite scale ranges from 0 (no deficits) to 46 (severe impairments).\nPerform the neuroscore at the same time each day and use surgical clothes to keep a neutral smell.\nHabituate the mice for 30 min in the room with an open cage prior to the testing and allow them to observe each item for 30 s.\n7. Perfusion\nPrepare a 20 mL syringe containing PBS-heparin (2 U/mL) and place it 1 m above the bench to facilitate/ensure gravity-driven perfusion.\nInject intraperitoneally 100 µL of ketamine and xylazine (120/16 mg/kg body weight, respectively). Wait for 5 min and corroborate the cessation of spontaneous body movement and vibrissae.\nFix the animal in a supine position and disinfect the abdominal body surface with 100% ethanol. Make a 3 cm long incision in the abdomen; cut the diaphragm and the ribs to completely visualize the heart.\nMake a small incision in the right atrium and insert the perfusion cannula into the left ventricle and perfuse with 20 mL PBS-heparin.\nAfter perfusion, decapitate the animal and remove the brain, freeze it using dry ice and store them at -80 °C until further use.\n8. Infarct volumetry\nCryosectioning: Cut the brain serially on a cryostat to 20 µm thick sections every 120 µm and mount on slides. Store the slides at -80 °C until further processing.\nCresyl violet (CV) staining",
    "To prepare the staining solution, mix 0.5 g of CV acetate in 500 mL of H2O. Stir and heat (60 °C) until the crystals are dissolved. Allow the solution to cool and store it in a dark bottle. Reheat to 60 °C and filter (paper filter) before every use.\nDry the slides at room temperature for 30 min. Place them in 95% ethanol for 15 min, followed by 70% ethanol for 1 min, and afterwards in 50% ethanol for 1 min.\nPlace the slides in distilled water for 2 min, refresh the distilled water, and place the slides in water again for 1 min. Then, place the slides in the pre-heated staining solution for 10 min at 60 °C. Wash the slides twice in distilled water for 1 min.\nPlace the slides in 95% ethanol for 2 min. Then place them into 100% ethanol for 5 min, refresh the 100% ethanol and place the slides in 100% ethanol again for 2 min. Afterwards, cover the slides with a mounting medium.\nAnalysis: Scan the slides and analyze the indirect infarct volume by the Swanson method16 to correct for edema: Ischemic area = (ischemic region)-((ipsilateral hemisphere) - (contralateral hemisphere)).\n9. Tunel staining (in situ apoptosis detection kit)\nDry the slides, post-fix in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (ph 7.4) for 10-20 min at RT. Wash in PBS, post-fix in precooled ethanol: acetic acid 2:1 for 5 min at -20 °C.\nWash in PBS and apply equilibration buffer (10 s to a maximum of 60 min at RT) and apply working strength TdT enzyme (1 h at 37 °C in humidified chamber)\nApply working strength stop/wash enzyme (10 min at RT), wash in PBS and apply warmed (RT) working strength anti-digoxigenin conjugate (30 min at RT in dark)",
    "Wash in PBS, incubate with DAPI for 5 min at RT and mount the slides with fluoromount media.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
