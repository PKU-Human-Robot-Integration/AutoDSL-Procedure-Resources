    "Note: For all animal experimentation, Institutional and National guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals were followed.\n1. Prepare Surgical Instruments and Solutions for Surgery\nAutoclave all stainless steel surgical instruments.\nPrepare 70% ethanol by diluting 200 proof absolute ethanol with sterile molecular grade deionized distilled water.\nAttach the 29 G needle to the Hamilton syringe. Clean the interior of Hamilton syringe and needle by drawing up and ejecting nanopure water repeatedly for 1 min. Repeat this procedure with 70% ethanol.\n\t\nRemove the plunger and needle from the Hamilton syringe. Air dry the parts in a laminar flow hood O/N.\nIrradiate the needle and syringe with ultraviolet light for 30 min before use.\nPrepare saline solution by dissolving NaCl in molecular grade water to a final weight to volume concentration of 0.9%. Sterilize the solution by filtering it through 0.2 μm pore filter.\n2. Prepare Oligomeric Aβ1-42\nMonomerize and resuspend recombinant human Aβ1-42 in DMSO to 5 mM exactly as described in the publication of Fa' and others13 .\nDilute 5 mM Aβ1-42 with sterile (1x) PBS to 100 µM on the day before surgery.\nMix the solution well by trituration.\nIncubate Aβ1-42 solution for 12 hr at 4˚C.\n\tNote: Control solutions such as diluting DMSO in PBS or scrambled/reverse Aβ1-42 peptide should be prepared the same way as Aβ1-42.\n3. Determine Injection Coordinates\nUse the adult mouse brain atlas to determine the exact anterior-posterior (AP), medial-lateral (ML), and dorsal-ventral (DV) coordinates for the brain region of interest14.",
    "​Note: To illustrate the technique we picked the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus as the target with the following coordinates from the bregma: AP, -2.00 mm; ML, ±1.3 mm; DV, -2.2 mm. The negative sign preceding the AP value indicates that it is 2.00 mm posterior of the bregma. The ± sign preceding the ML value indicates left and right direction from the center. Lastly, the negative sign preceding the DV indicates it is moving ventrally from the surface of the brain.\n4. Stereotaxic Frame Setup\nWear a surgical face mask, clean lab coat, and sterile surgical gloves.\nWipe down stereotaxic instrument and mouse adaptor with 70% ethanol.\nLay down sterile surgical drape on the counter.\nPlace the stereotaxic instrument with mouse adaptor on top of the sterile surgical drape.\nWipe the mouse heating pad with 70% ethanol. Position the heating pad over the stereotaxic frame bed. Use general purpose laboratory labeling tape to tape down the heating pad over the mouse adaptor bed.\n\t\nAttach the heating pad to the warm water recirculator pump according to manufacturer’s directions.\nTurn on the warm water recirculator pump and set the temperature to 37 °C, and then wait until it reaches temperature.\nAffix the 50 µl Hamilton syringe with a 29 G needle onto the stereotaxic frame by screwing it onto the motorized vertical injecting shaft according to manufacturer’s directions.\nTurn on the bead sterilizer and wait until it reaches the manufacturer’s preset temperature.\n\tNote: This is used for sterilizing stainless steel instruments between animals. It takes instruments 20 sec of contact with the beads for sterilization.\nTurn on hot plate and set it to 42 °C and place a clean empty cage atop.",
    "While the Hamilton syringe is fixed on the stereotaxic frame use the motorized stereotaxic injector to draw up the Aβ1-42 solution.\n\t​Note: Draw up more than 4 μl of the solution into the syringe and then use the stereotaxic injector to set the injecting volume. Operate the injector according to manufacturer’s instructions.\n5. Animal Preparation\nDetermine the weight of the mouse using the weigh scale.\nAnesthetize mouse with ketamine/xylazine cocktail at 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine by injecting intraperitoneally (IP). Monitor the depth of anesthesia by the loss of toe pinch reflex.\nAfter the mouse is sedated take the hair clipper and shave its head to expose the skin over the skull.\nPlace the mouse on top of the heating pad on top of the stereotaxic bed.\nUse the spatula to open the mouth and place the incisor teeth inside the teeth guard. Secure the nosepiece over the face of the mouse. Clamp it down gently and not too tight.\nPosition the bilateral ear crossbars into auditory meatus to secure the head. Move each crossbar in until it hits the skull, and then turn the screw to lock it.\n\t\nTo make sure the head is secured use your index finger to gently push down on the head. If the head is properly secured it will not give out or move when pressed.\nApply a drop of eye cream or eye drop to the eyes to keep them moist. Make sure the eyes are moist throughout the surgical procedure.\nTo disinfect the surgical site use sterile cotton swabs to apply betadine solution to the skin over the skull, followed by 70% ethanol. Perform the alternating betadine and 70% ethanol cleaning 2 more times.\n6. Surgery and Infusion",
    "Use a scalpel to make a 2-3 mm incision in the midline of the scalp, and then use a straight fine scissors to extend the incision line to 1.0-1.5 cm to expose the sagittal suture, bregma, and lambda of the skull, landmarks which the stereotaxic coordinates are based on. Use micro clamps to keep the skin apart.\n\tNote: The bregma and lambda positions are explained in the mouse brain atlas “The Mouse Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates”14.\nTake a cotton swab, soak it in sterile saline, and use it to clean the skull. Then, use a clean dry cotton swab to dry the skull.\nUse a sterile fine point pen to mark a dot on the bregma. Use the stereotaxic micromanipulator to position the Hamilton syringe so that the tip of the needle just touches the dot on the bregma.\n\t\nRecord the DV coordinate.\nTo check if the AP axis of the skull is level move the Hamilton syringe posteriorly so that the tip of the needle touches the lambda point.\nRecord the DV position. Make sure the DV coordinates for bregma and lambda are within 0.5 mm.\n\t\tNote: The goal is to minimize the DV difference between bregma and lambda.\nUse the micromanipulator to return the Hamilton syringe needle tip back to the bregma dot.\nRecord the starting AP position.\nCalculate the ending AP position by subtracting 2.00 mm from the starting AP coordinate.\nUse the micromanipulator to reposition the Hamilton syringe needle to the final AP coordinate.\nRecord the current ML coordinate.\nCalculate the left and right ending ML coordinates by adding or subtracting 1.3 mm from the starting ML coordinate.\nUse the micromanipulator to move the Hamilton syringe needle to either the ending ML coordinate.",
    "Touch the needle tip to the surface of the skull on both ending ML coordinates and record the DV coordinates and make sure the values are within 0.5 mm.\n\t\tNote: The goal is to minimize the DV difference between the two ending ML coordinates.\nWhile at an ending coordinate pull the needle up 0.5-1 cm over the skull. Take a sterile fine point pen to mark a dot on the surface of the skull. Repeat this step for the contralateral side of the skull.\nSwing the Hamilton syringe clear out of the way.\nAttach 0.8 mm drill head to the drill. Take the drill with both hands, set elbows on the surface of the table for stability, and position the drill head slightly above the sharpie dot on either the left or right ML coordinate. Activate the drill, lower the drill tip onto the skull surface to introduce a hole in the skull. Repeat this step for the contralateral side.\n\tNote: Some bleeding may occur from the newly introduced holes. If there is bleeding then use a clean dry cotton swab to dab the blood.\nMove the Hamilton syringe back into position over either of the newly introduced ML holes. Lower the Hamilton needle just past the skull. At this point be careful not to puncture the brain. To make sure the needle has passed the skull take your index finger and gently push the needle against the skull to make sure the needle doesn’t exit the hole.\nRecord the starting DV coordinate.\nCalculate the ending DV coordinate by subtracting 2.2 mm from the starting DV coordinate.\nLower the needle down to the ending DV coordinate.\nActivate the stereotaxic injector pump to pump 4 µl of Aβ1-42 into the dentate gyrus at a rate of 0.5 µl/min.",
    "When the infusion is complete let the needle remain in place for an additional 1 min to minimize backflow of solution out of the injection site.\nMove the needle to the other side of the brain and repeat steps 6.13-6.18.\n7. Animal Removal and Postoperative Care\nUnscrew the ear bars and face/nose guard. Remove the mouse from the apparatus.\nUse a student standard pattern forceps to pull close the scalp and then seal the wound with suture.\nInject 1 ml of sterile saline into the mouse via IP for hydration.\nInject buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) subcutaneously to relieve pain.\nMaintain the mouse in the clean empty cage set on top of 42 °C hot plate until it wakes, then return it to its housing cage with ample food and water.\nAdminister buprenorphine via subcutaneous injection every 12 hr for 3 days for pain relief.\n8. Suture Removal\nAnesthetize mouse with ketamine/xylazine cocktail at 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xlyazine by IP. Note: This is done 7-10 days after surgery.\nUse a student standard pattern forceps and straight fine scissors to remove the suture.\nInject 1 ml of sterile saline into the mouse via IP for hydration.\nMaintain the mouse in a clean empty cage set on top of 42 °C hot plate until it wakes, and then return it to its housing cage with ample food and water.\n9. Animal Sacrifice and Tissue Processing\nAnesthetize the mouse and perfuse it with 4% paraformaldehyde15, remove the brain, and process it for cryosectioning16.\n\tNote: The timing of animal sacrifice depends on the experimenter. However, for our studies we chose 7 and 14 days post surgery.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
