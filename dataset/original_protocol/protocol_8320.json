    "All procedures explained here were approved and carried out in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Florey Institute Animal Ethics Committee or the Neuroscience Research Center.\n1. Housing, Handling, and Food Restriction\nUse adult (normally 8 weeks old) male rats (any strains) and keep them in the room with a 12-h light/dark cycle.\nRestrict their food access to encourage the animals to perform the task.\n\tNote: Housing the animals singularly is suggested, as it provides a better control of each one’s food intake.\nOn days 1 - 3, handle the animals for approximately 5 min, 2x a day.\n\tNote: Handling familiarizes the animals with human contact and decreases the level of stress and anxiety in the animals throughout the experiments.\nWeigh the animals after each handling session. Use the first day’s weight as the free-feeding amount and keep the animals on about 80 - 85% of their free-feeding amount.\n2. Experimental Set-up\nUse a T-maze equipped with 3 partitions or arms, 2 stimulus speakers, 5 retractable doors, and 5 infrared motion sensors or infrared beam (IRB) sensors.\n\tNote: The T-maze can be constructed of medium-density fiberboard (MDF) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC).\nControl the maze constructed here by an Arduino microcontroller.\nCopy the Arduino code into the computer.\nDownload the Arduino software from the software website and install it on a computer.\nConnect the microcontroller to the computer using a USB port.\nOn the computer, click the software icon, go to Tools, and then select Port.\nFrom the drop-down menu, choose the COM port (Communication port) which connects the software to the computer.\nGo to Tools and select Boards. From the drop-down menu, select the type of Arduino that controls the T-maze.",
    "Click Upload on the top left of the interface window. Select the Arduino code. Wait until the process finishes.\nClick Serial monitor at the top right of the interface window. Then, in a new pop-out window, change the baud rate to 115200.\n3. Habituation to the Maze\nPrior to each session of habituation, bring the animals to the experiment room at least 1 h prior to the experiment.\nLeave 10 sugar pellets at each goal arm and leave all doors open.\n\tNote: At this stage, there is no need to track the animals’ movements (Figure 1).\nDays 1 - 3: Place the animals individually in the maze for periods of 10 min, 1x per day, to explore the maze with no restrictions.\nDays 4 - 5: Place the animals individually in the maze. Leave 2 pellets in each arm and allow them to sample the food from both sides. Remove the animal from the maze immediately after eating pellets from both sides or after 5 min of being in the maze.\n\tNote: The main difference between this stage and the previous stage is that animals need to be removed from the maze immediately after eating pellets from both sides. This would familiarize an animal with being removed from the maze at the end of a trial.\nAfter each session, clean the maze’s floors with 70% ethanol and make sure the ethanol has evaporated before placing the next animal in the maze.\n4. Discrimination Training\nMaze preparation \nDay 6: Bring the animals to the experiment room at least 1 h prior to the experiment.\nRun the Arduino program and set the trial number to 14 of which the first 4 trials will be forced-choice and the rest will be choice trials.",
    "Note: The program will randomly generate an equal number of trials to be assigned to the left and right side of the T-maze.\nBefore each trial begins, place 4 pellets in the goal arm which is to be cued as the HRA and 2 pellets in the other arm which is the LRA.\nForced-choice trial training (4 trials)\nPseudo-randomly block one arm before each trial so that the animal is forced to select the other arm.\n\t\tNote: The blocked arm can be a high reward arm or a low reward arm whilst the auditory signal highlights the side of the HRA.\nPlace an animal in the start box (Figure 1). After 5 - 7 s, simultaneously open the start gate and click Start in the Arduino’s interface window.\nCollect the animal immediately after eating pellets or after 5 min of being in the maze.\nLeave the animal in the home cage for 2 min.\nChoice trial training (10 trials)\nPrior to each trial, close door-B in the arm which is selected by the software to be the HRA. Leave door-A open in the opposite arm (the LRA).\nPlace an animal in the start box (Figure 1). After 5 - 7 s, simultaneously open the start gate and click Start.\nLet the animal freely choose either arm. If the animal chooses the HRA, open door-A, let the animal enter the chamber, shut door-A, and open door-B immediately to give the animal access to the selected food well.\nIf the animal chooses the LRA, open door-B in order to give the animal access to the food well.\nRemove the animal after it has eaten all the food in the selected food well and leave it in the home cage for 2 min.",
    "Complete the 10 choice trials for each animal and record the animal’s choice (HRA or LRA) in each trial.\nCalculate the percentage of high reward choice (HRC) for all choice-trials after each training session.\nFollowing the completion of 14 trails, the individual times obtained by each infrared sensor are shown in the Arduino interface window.\n5. Delay Training\nOnce each animal has reached 80% of HRC in the discrimination training (step 4), begin the delay training by running 10 trials per day for each animal. In this stage, door-B is to be opened after only a 5 s delay when the animal chooses the HRA.\nIf the animal reaches an HRC of 80% at the end of a training session with a 5 s delay, increase the delay to 10 s for the next training session.\nOnce the animal has reached an HRC of 80% with a 10 s delay, increase the delay to 15 s for the next training session.\nRecord the animal’s choice for each trial to calculate the HRC after each training session.\nFollowing the completion of the trials, the individual times obtained by each infrared sensor are shown in the Arduino interface window.\n\tNote 1: The timer starts when you click Enter. The ‘Time_decision’ is the time after the nose-poke to the IRB-1. ‘Time_left_1’ is the time when an animal breaks IRB-1L and ‘Time_left_2’ is when IRB-2L is broken. If the behavioral study is combined with electrophysiology or neural imaging (e.g., calcium imaging) methods, film recording is suggested for a better synchronization of the animal’s behavior to neural signals.\n6. Electrophysiology (Electrode Fabrication)\nUse single or bipolar electrodes to record the local field potentials (LFPs).",
    "Note: The use of bipolar electrodes is suggested because it enables local re-referencing to reduce the impact of the volume conduction. Therefore, the recorded LFP is the differential voltage between 2 electrodes with a ~200 μm distance between the tips.\nTo make a bipolar electrode, glue 2 tungsten electrodes together or wind 2 stainless-steel wires together (normally, PFA-coated stainless-steel wires with a 50 μm diameter are used).\nSolder the grounding and recording wires to a mini plug/socket to become a connector to the electrophysiology recording system.\n7. Anesthesia\nTo implant the electrodes, anesthetize the rats by an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (8 mg/kg), or by administering isoflurane as described in the following steps.\n\tNote: Isoflurane is recommended due to the improved control of its anesthetic depth.\nUse an anesthetic machine with a controlled oxygen and anesthetic vapor flow.\nTo anesthetize the animal by isoflurane, place it in the induction chamber and set isoflurane at a rate of around 4% and oxygen at 500 - 1,000 mL/min on the anesthetic machine.\nContinue the induction until the righting reflex of the animal disappears.\nSet the anesthetic maintenance rate at 1 - 2.5% isoflurane and 300 - 400 mL/min oxygen on the machine.\nPlace a heat-pad with insulation (cotton wool) on a stereotaxic device and then immobilize the animal in the stereotaxic device.\nMeasure the level of anesthesia by pinching the toes of the animal.\n8. Surgical procedure\nUsing an electric shaver or a pair of scissors, shave the animal’s head where the incision is to be made.\nScrub the surgery area with ethanol and then with povidone–iodine, 4%.\nApply eye lubricant to protect the animal’s cornea during the surgery.",
    "Using tissue forceps, gently pull the skin between the animal’s eyes and ears. Using scissors, cut the skin that is pinched between the forceps and remove the periosteum.\nUse hydrogen peroxide to clean and disinfect the skull.\nFind the location of the electrode insertion point by using stereotaxic coordinates and mark it on the skull with a permanent marker.\nUse a handheld drill to make one hole for the grounding electrode, one for anchoring the implant, and one hole per recording electrode.\nInsert the electrodes at a very slow rate to minimize the possible cortical and subcortical damage.\nConnect the grounding electrode to the skull using a small screw.\nSecure the connector plug/socket in place by using a thin layer of dental acrylic cement.\nInject buprenorphine (15 µg/kg, subcutaneously) or meloxicam (1 - 3 mg/kg, subcutaneously) as a painkiller.\nLeave the animal in a cage on a heated mat to recover. Observe the animal at least every 30 min until it has recovered from the anesthetic.\n9. Post-procedure Training\nFollowing the surgery, allow at least a 10-day recovery period. House the animals individually with free access to food and water ad libitum and monitor them on a daily basis (see Rudebeck, Walton, Smyth, Bannerman, and Rushworth7 for more information).\nFollowing the recovery, start restricting the animal’s diet to 85% of their free-feeding amount.\nRetrain the animals in the maze to recall the discrimination phase (step 4).\nContinue re-training the mice until they have achieved 80% of HRC.\nSubscription Required.
