    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nOrganoid Plating – 3D Format\nTiming: 2 h\nHere we describe how to plate the organoids, preserving their morphological and cellular organization in order to acquire high-resolution confocal images for 3D reconstruction.\nNote: For this protocol, we plate the organoids in a thin layer of BME2 (example in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) instead of the standard drops. This makes the organoids more accessible to the stain, since the thickness of the BME2 drop may prevent the reagents from reaching the inner parts, leaving the organoids unlabeled. Using a layer instead of a drop decreases the thickness, facilitating the imaging process.\nNote: Plate the organoids at least one day before the experiment and let them recover for 12–16 h. We recommend plating between 5–7 × 104 cells per well. You can let them to grow for a couple of days in order to see crypt-like structures with cellular heterogeneity (stem and differentiated cells).\nNote: Place the 8-well culture slide with the organoids in a humid chamber to avoid evaporation of the organoid culture medium.\nPlate the organoids in an 8-well culture slide; you have two options depending on your experimental conditions:",
    "Plate the organoids in a single cell format: Remove the medium and resuspend the drops containing the organoids directly with pre-warmed Trypsin. You can do this in the same plate where the organoids were grown. We recommend using 1.5 mL of Trypsin per one 6-well. Incubate 5 to 15 min at 37°C, checking regularly under the microscope the state of the organoids. Pipet up and down using p1000 first, and then switch to p200 in order to dissolve the BME2 and break the organoids down to a single cell format (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Confirm under the microscope that you have achieved single cell format, transfer the mixture to a 15mL tube and add 5 mL of medium. Centrifuge and wash once resuspending the pellet in 5 mL of medium. Count the cells and plate the organoids in the 8-well culture slide.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/179-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative Image of Single Cells and Small Organoids\n(A) Single cell suspension generated by trypsinization.\n(B) Small organoids generated by dissolving the BME2 with Cell Recovery Solution. Scale bars: 500 μm.",
    "Plate the organoids as a small organoids: If you do not want to generate single cells, we recommend to resuspend the drops containing the organoids in Cell Recovery Solution that will allow you to dissolve the BME2 while preserving the organoid structure (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Use 1.5 mL of Cell Recovery Solution per one 6-well and gently disaggregate the drops using p1000. Transfer the mixture into a 15 mL tube and keep it on ice for 30 min. After this incubation period, gently mix with p1000, add 5 mL of cold PBS and centrifuge the mixture. Wash the pellet with cold PBS and centrifuge again to obtain the pellet. In order to have an estimation of the number of cells you have, we suggest taking an aliquot of your organoid suspension before the incubation with Cell Recovery Solution and bringing it to a single cell state using Trypsin, counting, and extrapolating the result.\nResuspend the single cell or the small organoids pellet with BME2 by gently pipetting up and down. The amount of BME2 required would vary depending on the number of wells you need to plate. There is no need to perform this step on ice if the procedure is done quickly.\nCritical: Avoid bubble formation when resuspending the organoid pellet with BME2.\nDistribute 20 μL of the mixture per well in a layer format (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). With the help of apipette, make sure the mixture is evenly distributed and that it reaches all the walls and corners of the well. Avoid bubbles.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/179-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. 8-Well Culture Slide to Plate the BME2 Layer Containing the Organoids\n(A) Representative image of an 8-well culture slide with a BME2 layer containing the organoids (first well on the left).",
    "(B) During the incubation periods, place the culture slide within a humid chamber to avoid evaporation. Notice the wet tissues on both sides of the slide.\nCritical: Make sure to distribute the BME2 uniformly over the well when plating the organoids in the 8-well culture slides.\nPlace the 8-well culture slide in the incubator at 37°C. Because of its shortness, this step does not require a humid chamber. A minimum of 30 min is required for a proper solidification. This period of time can be extended for up to 1 h.\nAdd 400 μL of the appropriate growth medium to each well on top of the BME2 layer containing the organoids.\nPlace the 8-well culture slide within a humid chamber and let the organoids recover between 12–16 h in the incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nOrganoid Plating – Paraffin Embedding\nTiming: 2 h\nHere we describe the procedure to plate the organoids for paraffin embedding purpose. In this case, the organoids are plated in regular 6-well plates in a drop format (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/179-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Organoids Plated in Drop Format in a 6-Well Plate\nFor the paraffin embedding protocol, organoids are plated in drop format in a 6-well plate.\nNote: The number of organoids per well can vary depending on the experiment. Is important to calculate the number of wells you will plate before you start the experiment.\nNote: To have enough material, at least one full well of a 6-well plate is needed per condition (approximately 1 million of cells).\nNote: Plate the organoids at least one the day before the experiment and let them recover for 12–16 h.",
    "Plate the organoids in BME2 drops following the same guidelines we provided before. You can also plate single cells or small organoids. If you cannot plate the organoids immediately after you mix them with BME2, the mixture must be kept on ice until you use it, or the BME2 will solidify. If you are using a 6-well plate format, we recommend using 200 μL of BME2 per well distributed uniformly in a form of 10 μL drops (20 drops/well).\nCritical: If the experiment requires a high numbers of wells, or if you have little experience handling BME2, we recommend aliquoting the suspension of organoids in BME2 in order to avoid solidification. If using an Eppendorf, hold it by the lid, the warmth of your hands may speed up the process of BME2 solidification.\nAllow the drops to solidify in the incubator at 37°C for 30 min before adding the medium. A minimum of 30 min is required for a proper solidification. This period of time can be extended up to 1 h. We recommend using 2 to 3 mL of growth medium per well for the 6-well plate format. You can reduce the volume down to 1 mL for short incubations, such as during OPP incubation (1–2 h maximum).\nLet the organoids recover for 12–16 h in the incubator at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nOPP Incorporation– 3D Format and Paraffin Embedding\nTiming: 1 h\nDuring the OPP incorporation step, organoids are kept with regular growth medium in order to let the compound be incorporated into newly synthesized proteins.",
    "Note: The steps for the OPP incorporation are shared for both the 3D format and the paraffin embedding protocols. 30 min of OPP incubation should be sufficient to visualize its incorporation into nascent proteins. However, the incubation time can be extended depending on the organoid line.\nPreparation of OPP working solution:\nDilute the OPP reagent (from 20 mM stock) 1:1,000 in organoid culture medium to prepare a 20 μM final working solution. Prepare it fresh for every experiment.\nCritical: The range of concentration for OPP is between 2 μM to 20 μM. We recommend you to test and determine the optimal concentration yourself.\nRemove the organoid containing medium carefully and add 300 μL of OPP working solution per well for the 8-well culture slides or 1 mL per well for the 6-well plate. Alternatively, add OPP (1:1,000) directly to the well whenever you want to avoid the effect of fresh medium addition on your culture, or in the case there is a pre-treatment with a drug you wish to keep.\nIncubate the organoids for 30 min at 37°C, or under optimal conditions for the organoid type.\nCritical: OPP incorporation into nascent polypeptides halts translation elongation and leads to the generation of truncated peptides that can be targeted for degradation. It has been shown the maximum peak of OPP incorporation is detected 1 h after administration (Liu et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Signer et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). However, we already detected OPP with 30 min incubation period in our organoid model. Thus, we recommend incubation periods between 30 min and 1 h in order to maximize detection and minimize the influence of differences in degradation activity and eventually cell death. We highly recommend testing different incubation periods and adjust it to the organoid or cell line used before the final experiment.",
    "Proceed to fixation and permeabilization procedures specific for the 3D format (steps 14–18) or for the paraffin embedding (steps 19–26).\nFixation and Permeabilization– 3D Format\nTiming: 2 h\nAfter OPP incorporation, the organoids are fixed and permeabilized, followed by OPP detection and antibody staining.\nAfter incubation, remove the medium containing the OPP and wash the cells carefully once with PBS. Remove PBS.\nFixation: This step must be done in the fume hood! Add 300 μL of freshly prepared 3.7% Formaldehyde. Incubate for 15 min at 21°C–23°C.\nRemove the fixative inside the fume hood and wash twice with PBS.\nCritical: After fixation, the BME2 can lose consistency. Therefore, from this step onwards is critical to be careful when removing any liquid from the 8-well culture slide. We recommend tilting the 8-well chamber, placing the tip of the pipette in one of the well corners and removing the solution slowly in order to prevent any loss of BME2 containing the organoids. A p1000 pipette tip with a cut end can help.\nPermeabilization: Add 300 μL of permeabilization buffer. Incubate 20 min at 21°C.\nRemove the permeabilization buffer and wash twice with PBS.\nFixation– Paraffin Samples\nTiming: 2 days\nHere we describe how to perform the fixation of the drops containing the organoids and the material required for the embedding into paraffin blocks.\nNote: We recommend performing the fixation of the BME2 drops directly in the same 6-well plate.\nWash the wells with PBS.\nFrom this step onward, sterile conditions are no longer required. Inside the fume hood, carefully add 3 mL of Formalin per well and leave the plates inside the hood for 2h at 21°C. Use tin foil to protect the plates from light.\nWash the wells once with PBS. Remove PBS.",
    "Add again Formalin to the wells. Seal the plates with Parafilm and incubate for 16–18 h at 4°C, protected from light.\nWash once with PBS. Remove PBS.\nTilt the plates and remove the liquid, and, by gently pushing with the p1000 tip, detach entire drops from the plate.\nCollect the drops as gently as possible using a p1000 pipette with a tip cut at an angle (to make it wider). Transfer the drops to a microcassette, and put the microcassette inside a normal cassette (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/179-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Microcassette and Cassette Used to Embed the Organoid Pellets in Paraffin\n(A, B and C) After fixation, drops containing the organoids are placed within the microcassette (white) which will be placed inside the normal cassette (green).\nPlace the cassette in a vessel containing PBS and keep it fully submerged. Proceed to standard protocol for paraffin embedding.\nCritical: All steps except the 12–16 h incubation must be performed inside the fume hood. There are several ways to transport the drops from a plate into a microcassette, including using a cell scrapper to detach the drops.\nOPP Detection: Click-it Reaction\nTiming: 1 h\nIn this section we describe how to prepare the Click-it OPP reaction cocktail for a successful OPP detection.",
    "Note: The steps for OPP detection are shared for both the 3D and the paraffin embedding protocols. In the case of the 3D format, the click reaction will take place inside the 8-well culture slide. For the paraffin-embedded organoids, if you have followed the standard protocol for immunofluorescence using paraffin-embedded samples, you should stop before the incubation with the primary antibody and perform the click-it reaction prior to it. Even if you do not plan to use any primary antibody, you should still perform all the steps of rehydration and antigen retrieval of your organoid paraffin sections.\nPrepare the Click-it OPP reaction cocktail following the Click-iT™ Plus OPP Alexa Fluor™ 488 Protein Synthesis Assay Kit from Thermo Fisher Scientific.\nPrepare all the reagents required for the Click-it OPP reaction cocktail following the kit protocol (steps 1.1–1.4)\nFollow the recipe provided in Table 2 of Thermo Fisher'skit protocol to prepare the Click-it OPP reaction cocktail (steps 5.1 and 5.2).\nCritical: The Click-it OPP reaction cocktail needs to be prepared fresh every time and must be used immediately. When mixing the different components of the click-it cocktail is crucial to follow the same order as they are listed in the table provided in the kit instructions.\nAdd 150μl of Click-it OPP reaction cocktail per well for the 3D setting and incubate for 30 min at 21°C. Alternatively, incubate the slides carrying paraffin cuts, as you would normally incubate with the antibody. Volumes should be adjusted according to your needs. Make sure to protect the sample from light from this step forward.\nAfter the click-it reaction, wash twice with PBS. After this step, you can already proceed to analyze your samples. Alternatively, you can continue with immunofluorescence protocol.",
    "Alternatives: You can use a different color of Alexa Fluor picolyl azide. Alexa picolyl azide can be purchased from different vendors, the one we tested is listed in the troubleshooting section below.\nBlocking and Antibody Staining-3D Format\nTiming: 2 days\nNote: For the paraffin-embedded organoids, continue with your standard immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence protocol for paraffin sections.\nBlocking: Add 300 μL of blocking solution and incubate 1h at 21°C.\nPrepare 150 μL of the primary antibody dilution per well in a standard antibody diluent or in a blocking solution. Different primary antibodies can be combined together. (See the Key Resources Table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for the antibodies we have used). Add to each well the desired combination of the antibodies and incubate for 12–16 h at 4°C in humid conditions, protected from light.\nAfter incubation, wash each well 3 times for 5 min with 300 μL PBS. Place the chamber slide on a benchtop orbital shaker set to 60 RPM during each wash.\nDilute the corresponding secondary antibodies using a standard antibody diluent or in a blocking solution and add 150 μL to each well. Incubate for 1 h at 21°C protected from light.\nOptional: To visualize DNA/nuclei prepare a solution of DAPI (1μg/mL) in PBS. Remove the secondary antibody,add 300 μL to each well and incubate for 5–10 min.\nAlternatively, you can use Fluoromount G mounting medium, which already contains DAPI and this step can be skipped.\nWash each well 3 times with 300 μL PBS.\nRemove the PBS and detach the upper part using the removal kit provided with the chambers.",
    "Using a p200 pipette tip with the tip cut off add a small amount of Fluorescent DAPI mounting medium over each specimen (∼20–30 μL each). Place a cover slip over the slide, avoiding bubbles. Use clear nail polish to seal the sides of the cover glass to the slide. Allow to harden for 12–16 h at 21°C in the dark."
