    "Subcellular fractionation Cell harvesting from culture platesGrow the cells to a confluency of ~80%. Rinse the cells with 1× PBS.For adherent cells, detach the cells with Trypsin-EDTA. For suspension cells, proceed to step A1d.Add an equal volume of complete media to stop the trypsin proteolysis.Collect the cell suspension in a conical tube and centrifuge at 200× g for 5 min.Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 1× PBS.Perform cell counting and aliquot 1 × 106 cells into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.Centrifuge the tube at 200× g for 5 min and remove the supernatant.Keep the cell pellet on ice prior to the next step.RNA isolation from cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of cellsResuspend the cell pellet gently with 100 μL of ice-cold hypotonic buffer and incubate on ice for 5 min.Note: Volume of the hypotonic buffer can be adjusted based on the size of cell pellet. Check for membrane lysis with trypan blue. Proceed with centrifugation at 500× g for 10 min at 4 °C until > 90% of cells are lysed. Otherwise, increase the incubation time for step A2a until > 90% of cells are lysed.Note: Do not overlyse the cells. Collect the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) and wash the pellet (nuclear fraction) with 300 μL of ice-cold hypotonic buffer three times with centrifugation at 500× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Add 1 mL of RPS to the cytoplasmic fraction and incubate at -20 °C for at least 1 h.Vortex the cytoplasmic fraction in RPS and centrifuge at 18,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and rinse the pellet with 70% (v/v) ice-cold ethanol.Add 1 mL of TRIzol to the semi-dry nuclear and cytoplasmic pellets followed by the addition of 10 μL of 0.5 M EDTA.",
    "Heat both fractions at 65 °C until the pellet dissolves with vortexing.Cool the samples to room temperature and add 200 μL of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (1:24).Vortex the samples and centrifuge at 18,000× g for 10 min at room temperature.Transfer the aqueous supernatant into a clean microcentrifuge tube.Add an equal volume of isopropanol and incubate at -20 °C for at least 1 h.Vortex the samples and centrifuge at 18,000× g for 15 min at room temperature.Wash the pellet with 70% (v/v) ethanol and centrifuge at 18,000× g for 5 min.Air-dry the pellet for 5–10 min.Dissolve the air-dried RNA pellet in 30 μL of RNase-free water.Quantify the RNA concentration and purity with NanoDrop 2000c UV-Vis spectrophotometer.cDNA synthesis DNase I treatment for isolated RNAPrepare the RNA in PCR tube for DNase I treatment as shown in Table 1.Table 1.Components used for DNase I treatment table:",

If more than four pairs of primer sets (targeting linear mRNAs and/or circRNAs) are needed for primer-specific cDNA conversion, prepare 5 μM primer mix and add 1 μL into the RT reaction. ii. One may start with random hexamer for the cDNA conversion and switch to primer-specific cDNA conversion if the amplification of the targeted circRNA BSJs is weak, absent, or unspecific. iii. Random hexamer-generated cDNA allows amplification of any circRNA target of interest at any one time, while primer-specific-generated cDNA only allows amplification of the planned circRNA targets and does not allow any amplification of any unplanned circRNA targets. iv. Caution is needed when generating circRNA-specific cDNA, as the remaining unused reverse primer in the RT reaction could possibly interrupt or participate in qPCR process and lead to undesired amplification from linear mRNA.
