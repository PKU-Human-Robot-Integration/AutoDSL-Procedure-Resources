    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIntravitreal injection – day 3\nTiming: ∼3–4 h (dependent on animal number)\nThe following experimental steps are used to promote the activation of MΦ2 by CSF-1 within the vitreous body of the eye utilizing an intravitreal injection. This step additionally describes the use of AFS98, a monoclonal antibody that blocks CSF-1 receptors, or saline as an experimental control.\nNote: This protocol related to the injection into the vitreous cavity of the eye using needles and a micropipette is a modification and an optimization of previously published protocols (Gerhardt et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Kubota et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nNote: There are no pause points in this step, given the nature of the experiments. The whole process needs to be done without breaks due to the time limitation of animal anesthetization. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A for guiding critical steps.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1321-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Injection position and effect of the injection\n(A) Injections were made in the superior temporal quadrant and performed approximately 1 mm behind the limbus into the vitreous cavity\n(B) The frontal images of the isolated eyeball 15 days after the injection. Arrows show the optic nerve through the pupil. Asterisk shows a leakoma. Arrowhead shows a lens injury. Scale bar = 500 μm\nPrepare equipment and laboratory space for injection (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nIntravitreal injection should be performed under a dissecting microscope with a micropipette connected to a microsyringe.\nConnect a glass micropipette to a holder for the Drummond Nanoject II Automatic Nanoliter Injector (3-000-204, Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA. USA) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nStretch laboratory parafilm on the surface of a 35 mm × 10 mm cell culture dish and add 1 μL of sterile saline on top of the film.",
    "Press the fill-model to fill the sterile saline into a glass micropipette, and then use the inject-model to test the count of 1 μL of liquid. (See Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nInjection of MΦ2 activating or blocking agent into the vitreous body of the eye.\nAnesthetize mouse by intraperitoneal injection of the anesthetic mix (xylazine, 20 mg/kg, and ketamine, 100 mg/kg) 10 μL/g of the cocktail of 2 mg xylazine and 10 mg ketamine per mL is injected for adults and 6 μL/g of the cocktail for postnatal day 15 (i.e., for adult 200 μL for a 20 g mouse and 60 μL for a 10 g 15 day old mouse).\nAdd a few levofloxacin drops on the surface of the eye to be injected to prevent infection.\nInsert a 33-gauge needle to make a hole at a point approximately 1 mm behind the limbus at the superior temporal quadrant into the vitreous cavity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nFill a glass pipette with 0.5 μL of solution of CSF-1, CSF-1 receptor antagonist (AFS98), or saline, depending on the experimental group.\nPull out the 33-gauge needle lightly and insert the filled glass micropipette, which is connected to the Drummond Nanoject II Auto-Nanoliter Injector, into the hole made by the 33-gauge needle and inject reagent into the vitreous cavity. (See Troubleshooting problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nGently remove the glass micropipette.\nReapply levofloxacin drops on the eye surface to keep it wet and prevent infection.\nAfter injection, place the mouse on a heating pad until the mouse is awake and alert.\nNote: Build a channel for inserting a glass micropipette by using a 33-gauge needle to make a hole behind the limbus. Do not prick too deep and disturb the lens.\nNote: Test the count of 1 μL volume liquid once more whenever changing the injection glass micropipette.",
    "Note: Avoid touching the lens or retina, and the angle of injection should be ∼ 40°–50°. Best practice to choose littermate pups within a group. The animal number should be no less than 6; 2–3 pups for assessing macrophage subtypes 24 h after injection; 3–4 pups for analyzing fibrosis 15 days after injection. Every different injection solution needs at least three groups. Use of right eye is described here, left eye can be used too, however, better to keep consistent for all animal groups.\nAssessment of the distribution of various subtypes of macrophages – day 4–10\nTiming: ∼2–3 h (Day 4)\nThe following experimental steps are used to confirm the activation of MΦ by CSF-1 within the vitreous body of the eye utilizing an intravitreal injection. This step utilizes immunofluorescence to identify different MΦ subtypes using cryosections of the injected eyes.\nNote: A previous report showed that macrophage numbers increased sharply 24 h after CSF-1 injection (Hume and Macdonald, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), in our mouse model this increase of macrophages, at this timepoint, was indeed observed. However, the real time point of interest for certifying macrophage activation may vary in different animal models.\nIsolation of the Eye.\nCarefully isolate the eyeball under a dissecting microscope 24 h after CSF-1 intravitreal injection and put it in PBS.\nUse a sharp needle (BD Lo-Dose U-100 Insulin Syringes, Frankin Lake, USA) to make a hole for fixation at a location approximately 1 mm behind the limbus in PBS (same site of injection).\nFix the whole eyeball in 0.75% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for 24 h at 22°C. To enhance effect of fixation, the tube can be placed on a shaker shaking at the lowest speed (∼60 rpm). (See Troubleshooting problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).",
    "Note: Do not press or pull the eyeball directly when isolating the eyeball.\nNote: Pierce through the same hole made during the injection step to accelerate fixation for keeping morphological structure and relative relationship of eye tissues in order.\nTiming: ∼48 h (Day 5–7)\nEmbedding and Sectioning of cryosections.\nRinse off the PFA with PBS 3 times, incubating for 30 min each time.\nCryoprotect the eyeball by incubating it sequentially in: 10% sucrose for 1 h at room temperature, 20% sucrose for 1 h at 22°C, and 30% sucrose 12 h at 4°C. (See Troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nEmbed the eyeball in Tissue-Tek® optimal cutting temperature compound (O.C.T., Sakura, Torrance, CA, USA) in an aluminum foil mold in a sagittal position. To avoid potential tissue damage caused by the hole made for the injection and fixation, position the hole on the top of the eyeball using a microscope.\nDip the embedding mold in liquid nitrogen for a short time and repeat dipping until the O.C.T. changes to a porcelain white color, indicating freezing of sample. Store at −20°C for at least 12 h before cutting sections. Long-term storage can be done at −80°C for ≤ 1 month.\nCut sections in a sagittal orientation at a thickness of 12 μm and mount the sections on prepared gelatin-coated glass slides. (See Troubleshooting problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nKeep cut section at −20°C until use. Prior to staining, remove from freezer and let samples come to 22°C for ∼30 min.\nPause point: Staining Can be Continued the Next Day or later\nTiming: ∼2–3 h (Day 8–9)\nStaining of Cryosections.\nImmerse the frozen tissue sections in cold acetone, which increases the permeability and fixation, at −20°C for 2 min, and then air-dry the sections.",
    "Use Hydrophobic Barrier PAP Pen (Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, IL, USA) to draw a liquid barrier around each tissue section. After drying, rinse the slide with PBST (0.1% Tween-20 in PBS) to remove residual O.C.T.. Wash 3 times with PBST, 5 min for each time.\nAdd 0.1% Sudan Black solution at 22°C for 10 min to reduce the auto-fluorescence. Wash 3 times with PBST, 5 min for each time.\nIncubate with the blocking solution at 22°C for 1 h.\nTo determine MΦ1.\nAdd 1st primary antibody, Rabbit inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) polyclonal antibody (1:100 dilution, Rabbit, NB10059740, Novus Biologicals, CO, USA) at 22°C and incubate 12 h at 4°C. (See Troubleshooting problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11]).\nTiming: ∼13–14 h (Day 9–10)\nWash 3 times with PBST, 5 min for each time.\nIncubate with donkey-anti-rabbit 647 (1:400 dilution, Jackson Immuno Research, PA, USA) secondary antibody at 22°C for 1 h.\nWash 3 times with PBST, 5 min for each time.\nIncubate with the blocking solution 22°C for 1 h.\nTo determine MΦ2.\nAdd 2nd primary antibody, goat Arginase-1 (Arg-1) polyclonal antibody (1:300 dilution, NB10059740, Novus Biologicals, CO, USA), and incubate at 22°C for 1 h.\nWash 3 times with PBST, 5 min for each time.\nIncubate with donkey-anti-goat 488 (1:400 dilution, Jackson Immuno Research, PA, USA) secondary antibody at 22°C for 1 h.\nWash 3 times with PBST, 5 min each time.\nTo determine all MΦ.\nAdd 3rd primary antibody, rat-anti-mouse CD68 polyclonal antibody (1:500 dilution, MCA1957, BIO-RAD, Hercules, CA, USA) at 22°C for 1 h.\nWash 3 times with PBST, 5 min for each time.\nIncubate with donkey-anti-rat 594 (1:400 dilution, Jackson Immuno Research, PA, USA) secondary antibody at 22°C for 1 h.\nWash 3 times with PBST, 5 min for each time.",
    "Add 4′,6-Diamidino-2′-phenylindole (DAPI) (1 ug/mL, Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA) for 10 min, followed by a PBST wash 3 times, 5 min each time.\nMount with Fluoromount-G (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA) and seal with a cover slide (keep tissue hydrated throught this process). Then use nail polish to seal the edges of the cover slip carefully. After using the nail polish, put in a dark location for 10–15 min to allow the nail polish to dry.\nStore the slides in a black plastic box at 4°C to prevent quenching of fluorescence signals until imaging is completed.\nNote: After adding the secondary antibody, it is important to keep sections under dark conditions to prevent the quenching of fluorescence signals.\nNote: Staining times for primary antibodies can be adjusted (at 4°C for 12 h or 1–2 h at 22°C), however 4°C for 12 h is suggested for 1st primary antibody (usually the one with the lowest affinity) in order to maximize the binding affinity.\nNote: During immunofluorescence staining, tissue section slides need to be maintained hydrated. Dry samples may increase auto-fluorescence signals.\nNote: All the antibodies, including primary and secondary, should be diluted before use. Keep all solutions on ice.\nAssessment of fibrosis following MΦ2 activation in the posterior lens capsule – day 15–20\nThe following experimental steps are used to confirm that activated MΦ2, by CSF-1 injected in the vitreous body of the eye via intravitreal injection, induces the formation of fibrosis, which seals the injury site of posterior lens rupture. This step utilizes paraffin sections, to best preserve morphological details, and immunohistochemical staining to identify fibrotic tissue formation.",
    "Note: After isolation of the eye, observe the refractive transparency on the injected eye (right eye) and compare it with the non-injected eye (left eye). The optic nerve is clearly shown through the pupil (white arrows, Figure 2B).\nNote: If leakoma, a white corneal scar, on the cornea (black asterisk) or lens injury, a big opaque mass in the lens (solid white arrowhead), as showed in the Figure 2B, occurs, which can be caused by intravitreal injection, discard the sample.\nNote: For our mouse model, we choose the Cx50−/−/AQP0−/− knockout mouse, which has congenital cataracts. In such cases, it is hard to observe the refractive transparency. Special care must be taken to ensure the injective steps, especially the injection angle, are followed.\nTiming: ∼2–2.5 h for collecting samples\nIsolation and Fixation of the Eyes\nIsolate the eyeball carefully under a dissecting microscope 15 days after CSF-1 intravitreal injection and place it in PBS.\nUse a sharp needle (BD Lo-Dose U-100 Insulin Syringes) to make a hole at a point approximately 1 mm behind the limbus.\nPlace the entire eyeball into Fekete’s acid-alcohol-formalin fixation solution in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and incubate for 24 h at 22°C. Place on a shaker to shake at the lowest speed (∼60 rpm). (See Troubleshooting problem 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.13]).\nRinse off the fixation solution with 70% Ethanol directly.\nPause point: Tissue Processing Can be Continued the Next Day\nDehydrate the eyeballs with ethanol and xylene, then embed in paraffin.\nDehydrate the eyeballs with 70% Ethanol, 80% Ethanol, 95% Ethanol, 100% Ethanol (repeat 3 times) sequentially with 1 h each.\nChange to 100% Xylene (repeat 3 times) with 1 h each\nEmbed eyeball in paraffin wax.\nIncubate eyeball in 58°C paraffin wax for 2 h (repeat once)\nEmbed eyeballs into paraffin blocks",
    "Pause point: Tissue Sectioning Can be Continued the Next Day\nPrepare sagittal paraffin sections (∼ 3-μm thickness)\nPause point: Tissue Staining Can be Continued the Next Day\nImmunohistochemistry-stain with Monoclonal mouse anti-human α-SMA antibody (1:200 dilution, M085129-2, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and VECTASTAIN® ABC Kit (PK-6102, Burlingame, CA USA) following manufacturer’s protocol, then image.\nNote: Perform antigen retrieval prior to immunolabeling the paraffin sections.
