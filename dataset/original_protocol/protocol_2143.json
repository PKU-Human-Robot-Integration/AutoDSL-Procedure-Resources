Spray the mouse with 70% Ethanol.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1727-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Tumor isolation from MMTV-PyMT model\n(A) MMTV-PyMT mouse is pinned down on its back.\n(B) Incision area is labeled with dashed lines.\n(C) Localization of multiple mammary glands after cutting open the skin.\nOrthotopic model: Tumors from MVT-1 tumor bearing FVB mice.\nNote: Tumor size should be measured with digital caliper every week. Once a tumor volume reaches 1500 mm3, the tumor can be collected. For tumor measurements, W is the tumor width (mm), L is the tumor length, and a tumor volume (V) is calculated using formula, V   =   L  ( W  ×  W )   2   .\nThis step describes how the tumors are collected from both FVB mice bearing MVT-1 tumor and MMTV-PyMT mice.\nCut open the mouse skin from the area near the bottom of rib cage to neck with scissors (as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nGently hold the tumor capsule with half-curved forceps and dissect out the MVT-1 tumor.\nCritical: All the surgical tools should be autoclaved before use.\nGenetically engineered transgenic mouse (GEMM) model: Tumors from MMTV-PyMT mice.\nMMTV-PyMT mice are euthanized at 12-week-old or 15-week-old for tumor collection.\nCut open the skin from the area of the urethral orifice to the neck with scissors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPin down the skin as shown below (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) for an easy access to the tumors.\nGently hold the tumor capsule with half-curved forceps and dissect out the tumor.",
    "Critical: Although MMTV-PyMT mice have multiple tumors, MMTV-PyMT tumors are only collected from mammary glands no.3 and no.4 of each mouse as shown in the Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C. The tumors from other mammary glands are not collected (Plante et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nTumor sample fixation\nTiming: 5 min\nTrim off any visible contamination of yellowish fat tissue or brachial lymph node from tumor samples.\nImmediately put the tumor into a 10 cm culture dish and rinse once with cold sterile phosphate buffered saline (DPBS, pH 7.4).\nThe ball-shaped mammary tumor can be bisected along the longest diameter using a sharp razor.\nNote: The longest diameter needs to reach 15 mm.\nTransfer one half of each tumor sample into scintillation vials containing 10 mL of 4% buffered formalin (Z-fix) for histology.\nNote: The other halves of tumors will be used for isolating primary tumor cells or Western blot assay.\nAfter fixing tumor samples with Z-fix for 72 h at 22°C, rinse them once with 1× DPBS (pH 7.4). Dehydrate the fixed tumors and embed them in paraffin.\nParaffin-embedding and H&E staining\nTiming: 2 h for staining\nBecause necroptosis is a major cause of tumor necrosis (Jiao et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]), which normally happens in the core areas of solid tumors, identification of the necrotic region before necroptosis detection is critical. Therefore, serial sectioning in tumor samples should be used for identifying the necrotic region. Then those samples with tumor necrosis can be used in evaluating necroptosis by phospho-MLKL IHC labeling.\nThe formalin-fixed tumor tissue is entrusted to Histoserv company for paraffin embedding and H&E staining following a general protocol (https://www.histoservinc.com/[href=https://www.histoservinc.com/]). The brief procedures of H&E staining (Fischer et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) are provided below.\nTrim the top of the paraffin-embedded tumor block and cut 5 slides by 5 μm-serial-sectioning.",
    "Note: H&E staining is performed on the 3rd slide from serial sections (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The unstained slides will be used for IHC.\nPlace an unstained tumor slide in IHC slide staining holder. Deparaffinize the slide with 100% Xylene for 2 min.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1727-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. An example of tumor sample serial sections\nThe slide in the middle was stained with H&E.\nRepeat step 2.\nHydrate tumor slide in 100% Ethanol for 2 min.\nRepeat step 4.\nHydrate tumor slide once with 95% Ethanol for 2 min.\nWash tumor slide once with ddH2O for 2 min.\nStain tumor slide with Carazzi’s hematoxylin for 3 min.\nWash tumor slide once with tap water and place the slide in 95% Ethanol before proceeding to the next step.\nCounterstain tumor slide with eosin-phloxine for 30 s.\nDehydrate slide once with 95% Ethanol for 1 min and twice with 100% Ethanol for 1 min.\nRinse twice with 100% Xylene for 2 min.\nMount tumor slide with 200 μL of Permount solution dropwise to cover tumor tissue, followed by applying a coverslip.\nDeparaffinization for IHC\nTiming: ∼40 min\nThe necrotic areas of tumors can be identified based on the unique morphology of tumor necrosis from H&E-stained tumor samples as shown in expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]. After tumor samples with necrosis regions are identified by H&E staining, the serial sectioned slides of these samples will be stained with anti-p-MLKL antibody to examine necroptosis.\nThis step describes how to dissolve the paraffins from tumor slides for IHC.\nPlace tumor slides in slide staining holder (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C) and incubate at 56°C for 30 min in Shake’N’Bake hybridization oven.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1727-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

All the solution should be freshly made before use.\nWash tumor slides in ddH2O for 5 min.\nNote: All wash steps are performed on a shaker at 0.005 × g (50 rpm) at 22°C.\nAntigen retrieval\nTiming: ∼60 min\nThis step describes the antigen retrieval method specific for p-MLKL antibody. Antigen retrieval is critical for the paraffin-embedded tissue section, which unmasks antigens to improve the binding of p-MLKL antibody.\nTake out tumor slide from the slide holder and transfer into a 250 mL beaker (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B) containing 150 mL of 1× antigen retrieval solution.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1727-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "Once visible coloring is observed, immediately put the slide in fresh ddH2O to stop the reaction.\nNote: The DAB solution should be washed out immediately after coloring to inhibit background staining (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).
