    "Note: Single-end sequencing with 50 bp reads. The sequencing will inform how uniform the ePCR amplification was as it will allow the user to assess barcode representation and unimodal distribution (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The sequencing results will represent your ‘DNA input’ sample to analyze your MPRA and to quantify the barcodes in transfected cells.\nNote: Aim for ∼400–600× coverage, however, do not sequence more than one order of magnitude deeper than the final MPRA replicates, i.e. 300× coverage for replicate = 600× coverage for DNA input.\nIf the ePCR was successful (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B), up to 99.7% of barcodes can be found, and up to 92.4% of reads can align to barcodes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3142-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

White cells (VSMCs1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) depict GFP test transfection.\nCritical: When ePCR conditions are established, the assessment of barcode representation and oligo distribution by NGS can be performed after the cloning step to save resources. Ideal barcode representation is indicated by a unimodal distribution of oligos. A bimodal distribution of oligos suggests uneven representation of oligos in the amplified oligo pool or in the final plasmid pool. It is important that one does not move forward with next steps unless a unimodal oligo distribution is observed. Various samples can be sequenced on the same lane when primers with various Illumina indices are used.\nPause point: ePCR product can be stored at −20°C until the next step.\nHigh-throughput cloning of plasmid pool\nTiming: 7 days\nThis step integrates the oligos (candidate region + barcode), and subsequently a minimal promoter and a reporter gene, into the MPRA empty vector (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).

    "This protocol will describe how MPRA plasmid pools can be transfected into mammalian cells.

Alternatively, commercial RNA isolation kits such as the QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit can be used.\nCritical: Ensure your transfection efficiency is high enough to obtain an appropriate barcode representation in transfected cells (>∼40%). It is recommended to perform test transfections with a visual marker such as GFP to estimate transfection efficiency. We have successfully used Lipofectamine Stem transfection reagent (Life Technologies) to transfect cardiomyocytes and achieved a barcode recovery of 77.09%. Additionally, we used GeneXPlus (ATCC) to transfect vascular smooth muscle cells and achieve a barcode recovery of 54.80% (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).

    "Note: Due to the large quantity of plasmid DNA being transfected into the cells, one DNase I digestion is often insufficient. For this reason, two rounds of DNase I digestion are recommended, followed by a qPCR quantification of the remaining DNA (plasmid) contamination. This is important to prevent plasmid DNA from being amplified during the subsequent library preparation step.\nPerform an in-solution digestion using QIAGEN RNase-free DNase set as per the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/lab-essentials/enzymes/rnase-free-dnase-set].\nPurify this digestion using the RNeasy Mini Kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions.
