  "procedures": [
    "1. Pre-cultures of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii\nPrepare the pre-cultures of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (strain wild type CC-1690 mt+) by transferring cells from solid plates of TAP medium to Erlenmeyer flasks with 200 mL of HSM medium12.\nGrow the pre-cultures on a rotatory shaker at 24 °C at 100 µmoles·m-2·s-1 continuous light until the cell density reaches ~ 2 x 106 cells/mL.\n2. Synchronization of Chlamydomonas liquid cultures in fermenters\nNOTE: The parameters presented in this protocol, such as temperature, light and CO2, are specific to synchronization of the strain CC-1690 mt+. In order to develop a synchronized culture using another strain, it is necessary to test the optimal conditions.\nTransfer the pre-culture to a fermenter system (see Supplementary Figure 1 for the custom-made fermenter design), connected to a recirculating cooler to maintain the temperature, with bubbling of filtered CO2 (2%, v/v) and stirred with a magnetic stir bar at the bottom of the fermenter with constant agitation.\nTo initiate the synchronization, set the fermenter at light-dark regime of 12:12 h, under 34 °C and 200 µmoles·m-2·s-1 light and ensure it contains 500 mL of culture in HSM medium with a cell density of 1 x 106 cells/mL.\nAt the end of 24 h cycle, re-dilute the culture to 1 x 106 cells/mL with fresh HSM medium with minimal perturbation by using a tube system in combination with peristaltic pumps, which allows to first pump a distinct amount of culture out and afterwards pump in autoclave-sterilized medium.\n\tNOTE: As an alternate to peristaltic pumps, inoculating syringes can be used to withdraw the culture, while the required volume of fresh medium can be added directly into the fermenter under sterile conditions.\nRepeat step 2.3 three times to obtain the synchronized cultures on 4th day of inoculation.",
    "In order to validate synchrony of cells, harvest samples at an interval of every 2 h and measure the cell density and cell volume using a cell counter and size analyzer (see Table of Materials). Depending on the cell density, dilute the samples between 1:10 to 1:100 and measure in a size range of 30 – 1900 µm3.\n3. Harvesting Chlamydomonas cells\nLabel 15 mL conical centrifuge tubes and prepare a dewar filled with liquid nitrogen.\nHarvest samples using a syringe (50 cm3) through the inner glass tube of the fermenter. Distribute the sample into conical centrifuge tubes which should contain 10-15 x 106 cells. Note the volume transferred to each tube and measure the cell density and the cell size of each time point using cell counter and size analyzer (see Table of Materials)\nPellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 4000 x g. Then discard the supernatant, freeze the pellets in liquid nitrogen and later store at -80 °C.\n4. Preparation of extraction buffers and extraction chlorophyll, lipids and metabolites\nCAUTION: Methanol (MeOH) and MTBE are flammable and can cause irritation of respiratory tract, eye or skin on prolonged exposure and/or contact. Please handle them carefully only in a fume hood and use the appropriate safety procedures during the extraction (lab coat, safety glasses, gloves, etc.).\nExtraction Buffer 1\nIn a 100 mL volumetric flask, add 75 mL of MTBE, 25 mL of MeOH (UHPLC grade) and homogenize (3:1, vol/vol).\nAdd the following internal standards solution: 50 µL of corticosterone (1 mg/mL in MeOH), 50 µL 1,2-diheptadecanoyl-SN-glycero-3-phosphocholine (17:0 PC) (1 mg/mL in chloroform HPLC grade), 25 µL of ampicillin (1 mg/mL in water UHPLC grade) and 50 µL of D-Sorbitol-1-13C (1 mg/mL in water UHPLC grade).",
    "Transfer the extraction buffer to a clean glass bottle and pre-cool the solution at -20 °C, 1 h before use. Use freshly prepared solution for the extractions. This solution can be stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks.\nExtraction Buffer 2\nIn a 100 mL volumetric flask, add 75 mL of water UHPLC grade and 25 mL of MeOH UHPLC grade and homogenize.\nTransfer the extraction buffer to a clean glass bottle. Use fresh solution for the extractions. This solution can be stored at room temperature for several weeks.\n5. Extraction of chlorophyll, lipids and metabolites\nArrange the tubes, with the cell pellet (containing 10-15 x 106 cells), in liquid nitrogen.\nResuspend the cell pellet in each tube with 1 mL of pre-cooled (-20 °C) Extraction Buffer 1.\n\tNOTE: Perform this step quickly to avoid evaporation of low viscosity extraction buffer. After adding the Extraction Buffer 1, maintain the tubes at room temperature.\nVortex until the cells are well homogenized within the extraction mixture and aliquot the mixture into 2 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nSonicate the cultures using sonication bath (see Table of Materials) in ice cooled water for 10 min.\nIncubate all the samples on an orbital shaker at 1000 rpm for 60 min at 4 °C.\nTo induce the phase separation, add 650 µL of Extraction Buffer 2.\nVortex briefly followed by centrifugation at 20000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: After this step, there is a separation of liquid phases and a solid pellet in the bottom of the tube. Handle the tubes with care to avoid mixing of the two liquid phases. The top MTBE-phase contains lipids and chlorophyll, while the lower phase contains the polar and semi-polar metabolites. The precipitated pellet at the bottom contains proteins, starch and other insoluble molecules.",
    "6. Aliquoting the fractions\nTransfer 500 µL of upper MTBE-phase (lipids) into a labelled 1.5 mL tube. Dry the samples using a vacuum concentrator (see Table of Materials) and store at -80 °C until measurement.\nRemove the remaining MTBE-phase using a 200 μL pipette.\nTransfer 650 µL of the lower phase (polar and semi-polar metabolites) to a new labeled tube. Dry the samples using a vacuum concentrator (see Table of Materials) and store at -80 °C until measurement.\nRemove the remaining lower phase by pipetting off the excess volume.\nFreeze the solid pellet in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C until further extraction.\n7. Determination of polar metabolites (primary metabolites)\nResuspend the dried pellet of the polar phase (step 6.3) in methoxyamine-hydrochloride/pyridine solution for methoxymization of carbonyl groups.\nHeat the samples at 37 °C for 90 min.\nDerivatize the samples with N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifloracetamide (MSTFA) for 30 min at 37 °C as described previously13.\nUse gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) to analyze the primary metabolites. The gradient parameters used were according to the previously described protocol14.\n8. Determination of non-polar metabolites (Lipids)\nRe-suspend the dried pellet of non-polar phase (step 6.1) in a mixture of acetonitrile:isopropanol (7:3, v:v).\nCentrifuge at 20000 x g and separate on a reverse phase C8 column (100 mm×2.1 mm×1.7 μm particles), using a UPLC system (see Table of Materials). The two mobile phases were water with 1% 1 M ammonium acetate, 0.1% acetic acid (Buffer A), and acetonitrile:isopropanol (7:3) containing 1% 1 M ammonium acetate, 0.1% acetic acid (Buffer B).\nUse the gradient parameters according to the previously described protocol14.\n9. Determination of chlorophyll content\nMix 100 µL of the MTBE-phase (step 6.1) with 900 µL of 90% methanol for a method blank as well as the experimental samples.",
    "Measure the absorbance using spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 665 nm and 652 nm to distinguish between chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b.\n\tNOTE: The absorption should range between 0.1 and 1 for valid concentration calculation. Dilute the samples, if necessary.\nCalculate the chlorophyll a and b content, and also the total chlorophyll content according to the following formulas.\n\tChla = 16.82A665 – 9.28A652 \n\tChlb = 36.92A652 – 16.54A665 \n\tChla=b = 0.28A665 + 27.64A652 \n\tNOTE: The formulas were described by Bar-Nun and Ohad15.\n10. Extraction and determination of the protein content, digestion and analysis\nNOTE: To resuspend the protein, pellet urea/thiourea buffer (6 M urea, 2 M thioureaand protease and phosphatase inhibitors) was used with modifications in the protocol previously described16. However, any buffer of choice can be used for resuspension of proteins.\nPrepare the protein buffer using the following concentrations: 6 M of urea and 2 M of thiourea.\nDissolve the pellet (step 6.5) in 200 µL of protein buffer (10.1).\nIncubate the samples at room temperature for 30 min, followed by centrifugation at 20000 x g for 5 min.\nTransfer the supernatant, which contains the proteins, to a new tube.\nDetermine the protein concentration by Bradford assay17.\nDigest 50 µg of protein in-solution with a protocol of choice. Here, use the following protocol.\n\t\nReduce 50 µg of protein samples using 5 mM DTT for 30 min followed by alkylation using 10 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature in dark.\nAdd Trypsin/Lys-C Mix at a 25:1 protein:protease ratio (w/w), mix and incubate for 3 h at 37 °C.\nDilute the samples six folds using 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 8) and Incubate overnight at 37 °C.\nTerminate digestion by adding trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to a final concentration of 0.5–1%.",
    "After digestion, perform desalting of the peptides prior to mass spectrometry using C18 stage tips and elute the digested peptides18.\nConcentrate the samples to near dryness, leaving 2-5 µL of solution in a vacuum concentrator (see Table of Materials) without heating.\nResuspend the samples in loading buffer (5% acetonitrile, 0.5% formic acid) and analyze the peptide mixtures by LC-MS/MS using a high-resolution mass spectrometer (see Table of Materials) connected to a nano-UPLC system.\nSeparate the peptides using UPLC system (see Table of Materials) on a 20 cm reverse phase charged surface hybrid (CSH) column (see Table of Materials) with an inner diameter of 75 μm and a particle size of 1.7 μm.\nLoad 4 µL of sample and run through 90 min gradient at a flow rate of 300 nL/min.\nSet the gradient. Use partial loop-offline settings with isocratic gradient set at 3% of buffer B (99.9% acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid) held for 14 min before the loop is shifted to online position with the column, thereafter the gradient is increased linearly for 50 min, until 20% buffer B is reached.\nWithin the next 15 min, increase the concentration of buffer B to 30%. Then in the following 15 min, increase buffer B to 40%, before reaching 90% of Buffer B after another 4 min. Perform the washing step, which is required to clean the column, at 400 nL/min and hold for additional 10 min (see Table 1 for detailed gradient conditions).\nFinally, set back the system to a flow rate of 300 nL/min and a concentration of 3% buffer B within 1 min. Equilibrate the column for 15 min before the next sample is injected.\n\tNOTE: A complete list of identified proteins after LCMS/MS analysis is presented in Table 2.\n11. Extraction and determination of starch content",
    "NOTE: For determination of total protein and starch content, the solid pellet was extracted in a two-step procedure as described previously10.\nAdd 500 µL of 80% (v/v) ethanol to the cell pellet (step 6.5) and incubate for 10 min at 80 °C.\nCentrifuge at 4000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Then dissolve the pellet in 250 µL of sterile water followed by the addition of 250 µL of 100 mM sodium acetate.\nHydrolyze the starch by heating for 3 h at 99 °C. Digest the dissolved starch into glucose monomers overnight by adding an enzyme mix of α-amylase (4.2 units per sample) and α-amyloglucosidase (10 units per sample). Incubate the tubes at 37 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: After incubation, samples can be frozen at -20 °C for few days, or at -80 °C for several months, prior to glucose measurements.\nCentrifuge the digested extract at 20000 x g for 5 min and collect the supernatant. Dissolve the supernatant (with the starch-derived glucose monomers) in 100 mM of HEPES-buffer (pH 7) that contains 5 mM MgCl2, 60 mg/mL ATP, 36 mg/mL NADP and glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase (1 unit per sample).\nIn order to analyze the starch content, first measure the baseline absorbance at 340 nm. Then add hexokinase (1 unit per sample) to start the reaction. Finally measure the increase of NADPH+H+ (indicating level of starch digested to glucose) at 340 nm with a 96-well plate reader.\n\tNOTE: The difference of the maximum value at 340 nm (should not exceed the linear range of 1) and the baseline is equivalent to the glucose concentration of the digested starch. A glucose curve should be made to determine the glucose concentration in nmol of glucose per mL."
