    "Preparation of plant materialSurface-sterilize seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana, carrying a fluorescent reporter expressed at meiotic stages (an example is available in Prusicki et al., 2019). One efficient method to surface-sterilize seeds is by chloride gas: pour the seeds in 1.5 ml tubes, and mark the tubes with a black marker (other colors will faint due to the sterilization process). Leave the lid of the tubes open, and place the tubes in a racket inside a vacuum chamber. In the same chamber place a glass bicker containing 25 ml of a 7.5% bleach solution (eluted with tap water). Add to the bicker 1 ml of 37% HCl, quickly close the chamber and apply vacuum. The whole procedure should be carried out under a chemical hood. Be careful not to breathe the chloride gas! Leave the seeds in the chamber for 3-4 h. After the treatment, the seeds are ready to be sawn. If instead you are planning to store the sterilized seeds in the tube for some time, let the tubes open under a clean bench for a minimum of 30 min to ensure the gas has completely evaporated.Saw the seeds on Murashike and Skoog (½ MS, Recipe 1) squared Petri dishes enriched with selecting agent according with the resistance of the inserted construct. e.g., add 25 mg/L Hygromycin B to select for PROREC8:REC8:GFP as done in Prusicki et al. (2019). Alternatively, the selection can be performed by genotyping or based on fluorescence detection, if the protein of interest is expressed in seedlings.Store the plates for stratification in the dark for 3 days at 4 °C and then transfer them to long-day conditions (16 h day/8 h night regime at 22 °C/18 °C) for germination.10 days after germination transfer the seedlings on soil and grow them at long-day conditions.",
    "Plants will be ready to image in 3 to 4 weeks, depending on growth conditions and genotypes.Preparation of imaging samplesPrepare Apex Culture Medium (ACM) with agarose to 0.8%, 1% and 2% concentrations and 1,000x vitamin stock as indicated in the session (Recipe 2).Sterilize the ACM by autoclaving.When the autoclaved (or reheated) ACM with 0.8% agarose is hand warm, add the vitamin mix to a 1x working concentration (e.g., to 50 ml of ACM add 50 μl of a 1,000x vitamin stock solution), and pour it into small Petri dishes (35 x 15 mm), seal with parafilm and store at 4 °C.Pour the ACM with 1% agarose in medium-sized Petri dishes (60 x 15 mm), seal with parafilm and store at 4 °C.Aliquot the ACM with 2% agarose in sterile 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes and store them at 4 °C.Sample mountingCut an inflorescence and anchor it on a Petri dish with ACM with 1% agarose (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Removal of large flower buds and selection of the flower bud for image acquisition, Steps C1 and C2 Remove all the open and the elongated flowers at the base of the pedicel but the flower bud with a roundish shape and the size between 0.4-0.6 mm containing early meiocytes (Video 1). The characteristics of flower buds with meiocytes in an early stage can vary depending on the growth conditions and the genotype, e.g., mutants in which meiosis is delayed usually takes places in flower buds of larger sizes. It is therefore recommended to analyze several flower buds with acetocarmine or similar staining to estimate in which flower buds meiotic stages can be found. In general, flower buds at developmental stage 9 (Smyth et al., 1990) contain male meiocytes undergoing meiosis.",
    "Remove the upper sepal of the selected flower bud, being careful to not touch the inner organs of the flower, in particular the anthers (Videos 2 and 3).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Removal of sepal to give access to two anthers in the selected flower bud, Steps C3 and C4 <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Close up of a flower bud ready to image, after Steps C3 and C4 Remove the remaining flower buds (Videos 2 and 3). The next smallest/youngest flower buds can be left attached as a backup flower in the case the main flower bud gets damaged during the removal of the sepal.Lift the inflorescence from the preparation medium and cleanly cut the stem to a length of circa (ca.) 0.5 cm (with forceps or better using a needle) (Video 4). This will facilitate the uptake of nutrients from the medium and will keep the sample in good condition for a long time.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 4. Positioning of the selected and processed flower bud for imaging, steps C5 and C6 Transfer the sample onto the small Petri dish with ACM with 0.8% agarose, anchor it in the middle of the plate and cover the flower bud with a drop of ACM with 2% agarose (Video 4 and Figures 1A and 1B).It is possible to follow more than one flower bud in one microscopy session. In this case, prepare a new sample as previously explained (starting from Procedure C1 of the Bio-protocol), and locate all flower buds as close as possible in the center of the Petri dish (Video 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200427/20200427014215_5422.jpgFigure 1.

    "C Overview and D zoom onto the microscope stage with the sample positioned under the water immersion objective.Image acquisitionIt is important to have stable acquisition conditions, e.g., room temperature, humidity, etc. Therefore, it is advisable to turn on the confocal microscope in advance and position the sample in the room with a few ml of water covering the mounted samples.After approximately one hour you can start the image acquisition.Position the sample on the microscope stage, submerge the water-dipping objective and fill up the Petri dish to the top with autoclaved water (Figures 1C and 1D). It is advisable to thoroughly clean the objective with isopropanol before the acquisition to reduce the risk of bacteria growth during image acquisition.Using the visual function (or related software tools), identify the position of each flower bud in the sample and save it using the multi-position function on ZEN black software.The set-up for image acquisition needs to be adapted to the purpose of the experiment and to the characteristics of the used fluorophores. To follow a complete meiotic division in a time-lapse experiment, and to identify the meiotic landmarks using the KINGBIRD line as presented in Prusicki et al. (2019), the following set-up can be used:Use the Argon laser at λ 488 nm to excite GFP and the DPSS 561-10 laser (λ 561) to excite TagRFP.Use two tracks in sequential line mode for signal detection, and the Beam splitter MBS 488/561. In the first track, use the GaAsP detector to record the GFP signal filtered for λ between 498 and 550 nm. In the second track, use the GaAsP detector to observe the TagRFP signal filtered for λ between 578 and 649 nm.",
    "A third channel to detect the autofluorescence of chloroplast can be added to the second track and filtered for λ between 680 and 750 nm. Additionally, the Transmitted Light detection can be added to one of the two tracks.Set the Pinhole at 1 Airy Unity for the TagRFP detection, use bidirectional scan function and set the pixel dwell to a value around 2 μs.Parameters for image acquisition such as laser intensity, gain and offset have to be adapted to the individual imaging conditions. Among others, they depend on the laser status, as well as on the reporter line used, and thus the level of protein expression. In general, a compromise between sample viability and high-resolution imaging has to be found to obtain the best image quality while maintaining the sample in good conditions. In our case, we set the intensity of the Argon laser between 1% and 4.5%, while the DPSS 561-10 laser was set between 0.3% and 1%. The detector gain to collect GFP and TaqRFP signals was set between 700 and 850, and was set between 650 and 750 for the detection of chloroplast autofluorescence. In all the cases, the offset parameter was 0.Perform averaging on 2 lines in case of the KINGBIRD line; for other reporters, different setting may be needed.Acquire time lapse of multiple positions with 10 min interval time. At each position, perform a Z-stack of 6 to 7 planes with a step size to a maximum of 50 μm per time point. To follow the entire meiotic division, images should be acquired for ca. 30 h (Prusicki et al., 2019).The use of the Autofocus function at each position and each time point is suggested, especially for long acquisition times.",
    "In case the sample is still going through meiosis but the data acquisition needs to be shortly interrupted (e.g., in case of readjustment of the focal plane or in case of reaching the last acquisition cycle) it is advisable to fit the time of interruption to match the interval time, so to start the new time-lapse acquisition at the end of the 10 min interval.Image processingSave each position of the acquired time-lapse as a separate file, for instance in the case of the ZEN black software: processing → copy→ subset.Open the image in Fiji and save it in a separate folder as image sequence (save as → image sequence → format TIFF → digits must be enough to cover all time points e.g., 110 time points need 3 digits).Open the image sequence using MetaMorph (App → review multiple image sequence file → open sequence → follow the instructions), and select for each time point the z-stack layer, which shows the cells of interest. Finally, load the selected z-stacks for each wavelength and save them as tiff. files. This step helps to correct for the drift of the sample in the z-direction, and together with the autofocus function activated during image acquisition (see Procedure D6) allows following the same cells for the complete duration of the time lapse.Open the new files in Fiji, combine the different channels, adjust their brightness and contrast and generate an RGB version of the file.If an x-y drift is detectable, it can be corrected by using the plug-in Stackreg from Fiji (Plugins → Stackreg → Rigid body) (Thévenaz et al., 1998).An example of a time-lapse series after image processing is given in Video 5.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 5.
