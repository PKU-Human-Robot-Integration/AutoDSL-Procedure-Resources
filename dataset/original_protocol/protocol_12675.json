    "1. Characterization of Functionally Associated miRNAs in Glioblastoma\nAnalysis of broad differential miRNA expression in glioblastoma vs. brain\nFirst, determine the most significantly deregulated miRNAs in the tumor. This can be achieved using at least three different methods:\n\t\t\nMine the Cancer Genome Atlas, found at https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga, for sequencing data11.\nPerform microarray analysis from a fresh operative specimen12.\nUse previously published datasets13.\nNOTE: Whichever method is chosen, the output provides a bulk set of miRNAs whose expression is statistically correlated (either directly or inversely) with tumor biology. This initial group constitutes the pool of miRNAs that are further analyzed for the identification of a subset of miRNAs displaying the most stringent functional association by performing a more dynamic analysis of expression changes, as discussed below.\nCondition-specific miRNA expression analysis\nInduction of cell differentiation:\n\t\t\nUse pre-coated poly-D-lysine (PDL) plastic dishes to favor the formation of a monolayer culture. For dish coating, dissolve PDL in water at a concentration of 100 µg/mL. Use 1 mL of solution per 25 cm2 surface. Rinse 2x with PBS 6 h after application of the PDL solution.\nPlate human neural stem cells in equal amounts (100,000 cells/5 mL) either in stem cell medium (neurobasal medium + B27 supplement + 20 ng/mL EGF/FGF), astrocytic differentiation medium (DMEM + 10% FBS), or neuronal differentiation medium (neurobasal medium + B27 supplement, + 2 µM retinoic acid)14. The protocol for oligodendrocyte differentiation requires addition of IGF-1 (200 ng/mL) after EGF/FGF removal14,15.\nAfter cell plating, place in incubator for 1 week at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nRNA extraction:\n\t\t\nAfter 7 days, remove the cells from the incubator and remove the medium.",
    "Wash the cells with PBS (5 mL). Then, add 1 mL of lysis reagent (see Table of Materials) to lyse the cells and scrape the cells into 1.5 mL microfuge tube using a cell scraper. Keep the tubes containing the lysed cells at room temperature (RT) for 5 min.\nProceed to total RNA isolation following the manufacturer's instructions.\nmiRNA expression analysis:\n\t\t\nQuantify the differential expression of specific miRNAs identified in step 1.1 among the three differentiation patterns by real-time PCR, using TaqMan probes and following the manufacturer's protocols for reverse transcription and PCR amplification (Figure 1).\nValidation of miRNA clusters by stress-specific challenges\nCulture G34 glioblastoma stem-like cells in neurobasal medium + B27 supplement + 20 ng/mL EGF/FGF. Start with 1 x 106 cells in 5 mL in a 25 cm2 low attachment flask.\nStarting 48 h after plating, add doubling concentrations of DNA alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ) every 5 days, as follows:\n\t\t\nStart with 5 µM for 5 days. After 5 days, remove the medium and replace with fresh medium without temozolomide, to allow the surviving cells to recover. After 48 h, add 10 µM TMZ and incubate for another 5 days.\nRepeat step 1.3.2.1, doubling TMZ concentration each time, until a concentration of at least 100 µM is reached and cells become resistant to the drug10.\nIn a parallel experiment, irradiate G34 cells as follows:\n\t\t\nStarting 48 h after plating 1 x 106 cells in 5 mL in a 25 cm2 low attachment flask, irradiate cells with 2 Gy of energy (any irradiator providing photon emission is acceptable). Return the cells to the incubator and do not disturb. After 48 h, irradiate the cells again with additional 2 Gy of energy.\nRepeat step 1.3.3.1 4x until a total of 10 Gy of energy is administered.",
    "Return the cells to the incubator and let them recover in fresh medium for at least 5 days before downstream analysis.\nAfter the induction of resistance, lyse cells using lysis reagent and extract total RNA according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nAnalyze the expression of the specific miRNAs identified in sections 1.1-1.2 as described in step 1.2.1 (Figure 2).\nCharacterization of the functional convergence of clustered miRNAs\nObtain the predicted targetome of each miRNAs defined in sections 1.2-1.3 obtained using miRNA targeting prediction tools.\nNOTE: We generally resort to TargetScan, as its algorithm is periodically updated16. Additional prediction tools are miRanda17, miRDB18, and DIANA-miRPath19. All these programs are free, web-based applications.\n\t\t\nFrom the front page of Targetscan, select the miRNA of interest from the pre-populated drop-down menu. Click the Submit button.\nDownload the resulting list of targets as a spreadsheet using the Download table link (Supplementary Figure 1).\nTo decrease the chances of false positive predictions, include only targets within the conserved sites column in downstream analyses. Also, further stringency can be obtained by using additional miRNA prediction programs (see above) and only including targets that are common to all algorithms.\nClassify the resulting targetomes according to Gene Ontology categories using ToppGene Suite20 to evaluate for the enrichment of pathways that are common to each miRNA.\n\t\t\nPaste the list of targets obtained from step 1.4.1 in the \"Training gene set\" window, using HGNC symbol as the entry type. Click Submit > Start. The program will provide an output table showing the most significant \"Go\" categories for the entered list of genes (Supplementary Figure 2).",
    "To finally establish the contribution of each miRNA to the regulation of a common pathway or cellular process (in this case, chromatin regulation), check each targetome obtained in step 1.4.1 against the full list of genes involved in the specific cellular process (i.e., chromatin regulation), using the Venn diagram function provided in the Bioinformatics and Evolutionary Genomics website http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn.\nNOTE: This program allows the intersection of multiple groups at the same time (Figure 3). The specific unique targets provided by each miRNA are then annotated and selected for downstream functional experiments.\n\t\t\nIn the front page of the program, upload or copy/paste the list if target mRNAs for each miRNA or interest in the respective windows. Name each list with a unique identifier.\nClick Submit. The program will provide a visual output of a Venn diagram with numbers of genes in each sector, as well as a full list of mRNAs for each subset and intersection combinations.\n2. Assembly of miRNA Modules into a Polycistronic Transgenic Cluster\nPreparation of transgenic scaffold based on miR-17-92 cluster locus\nObtain the nucleotide sequence of the miR-17-92 cluster from the Ensembl genome browser21. Select the ~800 base pair \"core\" sequence encompassing all six encoded miRNA hairpins of the locus and at least 200-nucleotide flanking sequences both upstream (5') and downstream (3') of the core sequence.\nPaste the sequence above into any word editing program.\nDefine the sequence of each one of the six native hairpins by retrieving them in miRBase22. Mark each one of these sequences within the span of the previously identified \"core\" sequence. Any sequences between each hairpin represent spacer sequences, which are important for the correct processing of the transgene.",
    "Remove the native hairpin sequences from the \"core\" sequence, with the exception of 3-5 nucleotides at both the 5' and 3' ends of each hairpin, which will serve as an acceptor for the new hairpins.\nBuilding a new transgene encoding multiple miRNAs of choice\nObtain hairpin sequences of miRNAs intended to be overexpressed in the transgene from miRBase. Carefully note the specific nucleotides that are the sites of microprocessor cleavage.\nReplace the removed hairpins (step 2.1.4) with the hairpin sequences of the desired miRNAs obtained in step 2.2.1.\nAdd desired restriction sequences at both flanking regions of the transgene to facilitate subcloning into delivery vectors of choice. Verify that the chosen restriction sequences are not present within the sequence itself.\nFor negative controls, use 20-nucleotide scrambled sequences to replace the natural 20-nucleotide sequence of each mature miRNA. Generate these scrambled sequences using an online tool such as https://genscript.com/tool/create-scrambled-sequence.\nVerifying the two-dimensional structure of the transgene\nCopy the full transgenic sequence into the RNA structure prediction software program RNAweb Fold23.\nUsing standard program settings, click Proceed.\nAnalyze the graphical output, particularly for the presence of well-defined hairpins and presence of double-stranded stem structures at least 11 nucleotides proximal to the microprocessor cleavage site. Also, look for the absence of branching points within the hairpin sequences (Figure 4).\n3. Obtaining Transgenes by DNA Synthesis\nAfter the design and in silico validation of the chimeric miRNA cluster, obtain the working sequence using DNA synthesis from commercial vendors24 and proceed with downstream cloning into vectors and transgene delivery. We have used lentiviral vectors for in vitro delivery10 and adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) for in vivo intracranial delivery25.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
