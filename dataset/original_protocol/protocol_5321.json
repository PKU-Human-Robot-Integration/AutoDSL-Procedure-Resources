    "UV crosslinkingAdd 400 µl of 100 µg/ml each of purified BMV virions into 3 wells of a 6-well cell culture plate. Incubated the plate on ice for at least 5 min. Place the plate without the cover in the crosslinking machine and irradiate three times at 254 nm to 400 mJ/cm2 (Figure 1). Between irradiations, agitate the samples with gently tapping the plate to mix the samples and incubate the plate on ice for 3 min to prevent the samples from overheating. Repeat the irradiation, agitation, and incubation on ice two more times. Notes:  BMV virions are purified to homogeneity using cesium chloride density gradients as described in Ni et al., 2014. The concentration of the purified virion was determined in Ni et al., 2014. The dose of irradiation that provided optimal crosslinking of the BMV virion RNAs was determined empirically by sequencing the RNA fragments processed through the protocol. The same conditions were also successfully used for crosslinking of bacteriophage MS2 RNA (Rolfsson et al., 2016). Nonetheless, it is quite likely that modifications in the crosslinking time should be empirically determined for other virions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170712/20170712200906_9695.jpgFigure 1. Location of the plate containing BMV virions in the UV crosslinkerFor a negative control, repeat step A1, but do not irradiate the virions. This control reaction can be processed in parallel with the irradiated virion.Harvest and pool the irradiated virion solutions into a small polyallomer centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 150,000 x g for 30 min using a preparative ultracentrifuge. Resuspend the virion pellet in 150 µl 100 mM Tris (pH 7.0). Add 15 µl of RNA Fragmentation Reagent, mix and incubate at 70 °C for 15 min.Note: We have empirically examined several combinations of ribonucleases and observed more bias in the cleavage of the RNAs.",
    "Zinc-induced cleavage of the RNA produced more random cleavage of the RNA, is easier to use, and is easily removed during the processing of the samples. For BMV, the conditions used will fragment the BMV RNA to ~50-nt in length (Figure 2). During the fragmentation step, the pH of the solution and the incubation at 70 °C will cause the BMV virion to dissociate and denature. The virion solution should become cloudy soon after incubation. With other virions, it will be important to try different conditions to identify those that can generate relatively short RNA fragments.Add 15 µl 0.2 M EDTA (pH 8.0), mix and incubate on ice for 10 min to stop the reaction.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170712/20170712201019_3544.jpgFigure 2. Time-dependent fragmentation of RNAs from UV-crosslinked BMV virions. The image shown is from ethidium bromide-stained agarose gel containing 100 μg BMV virions that were resuspended in 150 μl Tris buffer (pH: 7.0) containing 10 Mm ZnCl2, and heated at 70 °C to fragment BMV RNA for the time indicated in the gel image.Immunoprecipitation and RNA extractionAdd 50 µl of the Pierce Protein A/G magnetic beads suspension into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 1 ml of ice-cold IP binding buffer (see Recipes), mix, and then concentrate the beads by placing the tube against the magnetic tube holder. The beads should be concentrated on the side of the microcentrifuge tube. Use a pipette to remove the supernatant. Repeat the washing of the beads.Resuspend beads in 100 µl ice-cold IP binding buffer, add the anti-BMV CP antibody and the crosslinked CP-RNA solution from step A5 and place the tube to mix on a rocking platform set at 50 rpm at 4 °C for 2 h.Collect the beads and co-precipitated protein using a magnetic tube holder. Remove the supernatant.",
    "Add 1 ml ice-cold IP binding buffer to wash the beads four times, each time collect the beads using Magnastrip and remove the supernatant.Remove final wash solution, add 100 µl of Laemmli sample buffer (see Recipes) to the beads, mix and heat at 95 °C for 2 min, load up to 30 µl samples on precast 4-12% Bis-Tris gel, and run the gel for 1 h at 150 V in 1x MES SDS running buffer. Transfer protein-RNA complexes from the gel to a PVDF membrane using a wet transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Transfer should be at 100 V for 2.5 h.Note: Transferring the protein from the denaturing PAGE to the PVDF membrane will help to remove non-covalently bound RNA fragments, and will decrease the background.Rinse the membrane with sterile PBS buffer twice, stain with 0.1% Ponceau-S for 10 min. then rinse the membrane with sterile PBS twice to remove excess dye. Cut out the portion of the membrane at ca. 3-4 mm above the BMV CP band using a new razor blade (Figure 3). Transfer the membrane slice that contains the CP and crosslinked RNA fragments into a 1.5 ml sterile microcentrifuge tube, rinse with sterile PBS twice.Note: The membrane slices can be stored at -80 °C until use.Add 200 µl of 1 mg/ml Proteinase K diluted in the PK buffer (see Recipes) to the membrane slice. Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h with occasional mixing to digest the CP.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170712/20170712201157_1485.jpgFigure 3.

The boxes with dashed lines denote the area of the membrane excise with a razor blade.",
    "cDNA library construction and Illumina DNA sequencingApply the solution from step B7 that contains eluted RNA fragments to a Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator column. Elute the RNA using 35 µl elution buffer from the kit.Add 5 µl of 10x PNK buffer and 50 U of the PNK enzyme and 5 µl of 10 mM ATP. Incubate the mixture at 37 °C for 30 min. Note: The PNK adds a 5’-phosphate to the RNAs to enable the addition of oligonucleotides adaptors needed for library construction. Transfer the RNA to a fresh Zymo RNA Clean & Concentrator column and elute the RNA in 7 µl elution buffer from the kit. Analyze 2 µl of the eluant on an Agilent High-sensitivity RNA TapeStation tape to determine the RNA concentration. Use a volume of remaining eluant that contains between 200 ng to 1 µg of the eluted RNA to construct a cDNA library using an Illumina Small RNA kit. Construction of the library as per the manufacturer’s instruction using 11 to 15 cycles of DNA amplification, with the cycle number being dependent on the mass of the RNA present. Estimate the concentration of the libraries using the Agilent High-sensitivity DNA TapeStation.Pool the libraries then clean and concentrate the pool using a 1.8x ratio of SPRIselect beads (Beckman Coulter) and eluted in 22 µl. Note: In the TapeStation, the libraries of DNA fragments are separated by electrophoresis from the adaptors, the primer dimers and other DNA molecules generated during the amplification process. The DNAs of lengths expected to have adaptors flanking the cDNA are excised and eluted. The libraries (5 µl with ca. 500 ng of each library) were denatured with 5 µl of 0.2 N NaOH for 5 min, then neutralized with 985 µl of the HT1 buffer provided by Illumina.",
    "5 µl of the 200 mM Tris pH 7.5 was added to supplement the buffering capacity of the HT1 buffer.Note: Given the small sizes of viral genomes, multiple viral libraries can be a small percentage of an Illumina sequencing run. Even 1% of the sample on a run can still result in several hundred thousand reads for each of the libraries.The Illumina NextSeq500 run was performed by members of the Indiana University CGB staff using a 75-High output flow cell designated for an 80-bp read."
