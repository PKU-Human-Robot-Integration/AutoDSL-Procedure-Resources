    "All animal studies in this protocol were completed in compliance with Federal, State, and local guidelines, and using protocols reviewed and approved by the University of Maryland's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).\n1. Synthesis of Lipid-stabilized Micro- and Nanoparticles\nIn a 7 ml glass vial(s), combine DOPC, DSPE-PEG, and DOTAP lipids at a 60:20:20 molar ratio to prepare a master lipid mix.\n\t\nTo synthesize a single sample: Transfer 242.9 μl, 287.4 μl, and 71.9 μl, of DOPC, DSPE-PEG, and DOTAP respectively, into the vial using 2 ml glass serological pipettes.\nTo synthesize multiple samples: Multiply each lipid volume above by the number of samples and combine into a single vial, then transfer equal aliquots of this lipid mixture into vials corresponding to each sample to be prepared.\nDry lipids under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas for 10 min, or place in vacuum oven overnight.\nIn a single, empty 20 ml glass vial, dissolve 80 mg of PLGA in 5 ml of dichloromethane for each particle sample to generate a 16 mg/ml polymer stock solution.\nAdd 5 ml of polymer solution to the vial(s) containing the dried lipids, cap, and vortex for 30 sec.\nTo synthesize microparticles:\n\t\nBegin sonicating the organic phase containing the polymer, lipid, and other water-insoluble cargo on ice at 12 W using a sonicator.\nCreate the water-in-oil (w/o) emulsion by using a pipette to add 500 µl of distilled H2O, or H2O containing 1 mg of peptide, protein, or other water soluble cargo.\nContinue sonicating for 30 sec at 12 W on ice, gently rocking the vial up and down and side to side around the sonicator tip to ensure complete emulsification.\nCreate the water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) emulsion by pouring the w/o emulsion into 40 ml of H­2O in a 150 ml beaker.",
    "Homogenize for 3 min at 16,000 rpm using a digital homogenizer.\nAdd a magnetic stir bar, transfer the beaker to a stir plate, and allow the w/o/w emulsion to stir overnight to remove the excess solvent.\nTo synthesize nanoparticles:\n\t\nBegin sonicating the organic phase containing the polymer, lipid, and other water insoluble cargo on ice at 14 W.\nCreate the w/o emulsion by using a pipette to add 500 µl of distilled H2O, or H2O containing 1 mg of peptide, protein, or other water soluble cargo.\nContinue sonicating for 30 sec at 14 W on ice.\nCreate the w/o/w emulsion by pouring the w/o emulsion to 40 ml of H­2O in a 150 ml beaker and sonicating for 5 min at 16 W on ice. Gently rock the vial up and down and side to side around the sonicator tip to ensure complete emulsification.\nAdd a magnetic stir bar, transfer the flask to a stir plate and allow the w/o/w emulsion to stir overnight to remove the excess solvent.\nThe next morning, wash and collect particles:\n\t\nPour emulsion through 40 µm Nylon mesh cell strainer into a 50 ml conical tube.\nCentrifuge particles for 5 min at 5,000 x g for microparticles or 5 min at 24,000 x g for nanoparticles.\nDecant supernatant and wash particles by resuspending in 1 ml of H­2O.\nTransfer suspended particles to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 5,000 x g for microparticles or 5 min at 24,500 x g for nanoparticles.\nWash particles twice more by removing supernatant, resuspending in 1 ml H2O, and centrifuging as in step 1.6.5. After washing, suspend particles in 1 ml H2O for immediate use, or lyophilize for extended storage.\n2. Measurement of Synthesis Yield",
    "Preweigh an empty 20 ml glass vial. Add 100 µl of particle suspension to the preweighed vial after pipetting up and down with a micropipette to mix.\nLyophilize the particles or dry under a gentle stream of nitrogen.\nWeigh the vial containing the dried polymer. Determine the particle yield in the vial by subtracting the original weight of the vial from the mass of the vial containing the dried particles.\nDetermine the overall particle yield by multiplying the particle mass in the vial by the dilution factor. To determine percent yield, divide the particle mass by the maximum theoretical input mass and multiply by 100%.\n3. Determination of Particle Size\nClean the supplied cuvette-style glass fraction cell by filling with deionized water and wiping with cotton-tipped swab. Transfer 10 ml of distilled H2O to the cleaned faction cell, add magnetic micro stir bar, and load the fraction cell into the cell mount of the particle size analyzer.\nAdjust the magnetic stirring speed in the particle analyzer to achieve complete mixing in the fraction cell and close the compartment door.\nAlign the lasers to the fraction cell using the instrument software interface.\nUse the instrument software interface to record a baseline reading with the fraction cell containing only distilled H­2O.\nPipette the original particle suspension up and down with a micropipette to mix.\nPipette 10 µl of particle suspension (typically approximately 0.5 mg) into the fraction cell. Ensure the volume of particle sample added to the cell is sufficient to generate signal strength in the appropriate range as indicated on the instrument software interface. The actual mass of particles required is dependent on percent yield and the optical properties of the particle sample.",
    "Close the particle size analyzer compartment door and measure particle size using a refractive index of 1.60 for PLGA.\nUse the software interface to calculate particle diameter using a number basis.\n4. Visualization of Particles\nPipette particle suspension up and down with micropipette to mix. Dilute particle suspension to 1 mg/ml in deionized water.\nPrepare a microscope slide by adding 3 µl of diluted particle suspension and mounting a coverslip at a 45° angle to avoid bubble formation. Place the slide on microscope stage and image using the appropriate filter sets for each fluorescent cargo.\n5. Preparation of Mice for i.LN. Injection\nPrepare tracer dye solution:\n\t\nPrepare a 0.1% (w/v) solution of tracer dye by dissolving 10 mg of dye powder with 10 ml of distilled H2O.\nSterilize the dye solution into a glass vial using a 0.2 µm syringe filter.\nOne day prior to injection, anesthetize mouse using isoflurane according to an IACUC approved animal protocol. To evaluate depth of anesthesia, perform a toe pinch reflex test and monitor breathing rate to ensure a respiratory rate of approximately 100-140 breaths per minute.\nShave hair at base of tail and hindquarter using clippers while the mouse is anesthetized. Remove hair from the ventral side of the animal and laterally around to the dorsal side just above the joint of the hind leg (hip).\nInject tracer dye.\n\t\nFor each dye injection, use a micropipette to transfer 10 μl of dye solution into a microcentrifuge tube, and aspirate the entire 10 μl into a 31G needle attached to a 1 ml syringe.\nInject 10 μl of dye solution subcutaneously on each side of the tail base where the hair was clipped, reloading in between injections.",
    "Remove remaining hair by applying a mild depilatory cream via cotton swabs. Be sure to coat the area in between the hind thigh and abdomen.\nAllow depilatory cream to incubate on skin for 3 min. After incubation, wet gloved hand with warm H2O and gently rub depilatory cream into skin.\nImmediately remove depilatory cream by wetting gloved hand with warm H2O and rubbing tail base and hindquarter. Repeat until excess depilatory is removed, making sure to keep hand wet to avoid irritation.\nRemove residual depilatory from mouse by wetting a soft cloth or paper towel with warm H2O and in a single motion, wiping lower portion of mouse. Avoid a rubbing motion to prevent abrasion or skin damage to the mouse.\nAllow mouse to recover under a heat lamp and return to holding.\n6. i.LN. Injection of Particles\nOn the following day, anesthetize mouse using isoflurane according to an IACUC approved animal protocol.\nExamine the mouse to confirm drainage of tracer dye into each inguinal lymph node. The lymph node should be visible as a dark spot near the hind thigh and abdomen.\nPrepare particle injection solution:\n\t\nResuspend particles in distilled H2O at desired injection concentration. For each injection, use a micropipette to transfer 10 µl of particle solution into a microcentrifuge tube.\nAspirate the entire 10 µl into a 31G insulin needle attached to a 1 ml syringe.\nInject particle dose:\n\t\nAfter visualizing LN, tighten skin around LN using thumb, index finger, and middle finger to pull skin taunt and allow for controlled placement of the injection volume.\nApproach the LN with the needle at a 90° angle to the skin and penetrate the skin over the dyed LN to a depth of 1 mm.",
    "Slowly inject the entire volume. During injection, observe the LN volume through the skin to confirm injection by visible LN enlargement.\nAllow the mouse to recover under a heat lamp and return to holding or conduct additional testing.\nFor relevant analysis techniques (e.g. histology, flow cytometry) see JoVE Articles 265, 1743, and 3054 and Current Protocols in Immunology, chapters 5 and 2115-22."
