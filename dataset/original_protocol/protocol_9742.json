    "1. Creation of silicone masters\nNOTE: Most of the process of the design, creation, and troubleshooting of silicon masters for the repeated molding of PDMS stamps has been covered previously21, so only key differences in this new approach will be described here.\nCreate the design for the photomask using AutoCAD or similar design software. Coat one side of the photomask, a thin piece of glass, with a thin layer of chrome to control UV light scattering. Design the photomask so that shining UV light through it onto the chosen photoresist will create a silicone master with the inverse of the features desired on the final PDMS stamps. See Figure 1 for the design of this mask.\n\tNOTE: Whether the desired features or the area outside them should be made transparent on the photomask depends on the chosen photoresist. The photoresist used here is SU-8 2005 (CAUTION: flammable, skin and eye irritant; keep away from heat/flames/sparks and use protective gloves and eyewear when handling), a negative photoresist which is capable of making 5 µm tall features with near-vertical sidewalls.\n\t\nCure the negative photoresist by exposing it to UV light and removing the uncured SU-8 with a chemical solvent. Therefore, design the primary features of the mask to be transparent while the surrounding area of the mask is opaque.\nFor this new removal method, design the photomask so that it is composed of two squares of 1.5 x 1.5 cm (Figure 1A), one full of an even grid of 2 µm circles spaced 6 µm center to center, and another made up of many square islands which are smaller, isolated versions of that same grid pattern (Figure 1B). Make islands of the following sizes: 6 x 6 dots, 12 x 12 dots, 25 x 25 dots, and 42 x 42 dots.",
    "NOTE: The diameter of the adhesion points (2 µm) was chosen based on previous studies that measured cellular traction forces22,23. The mask used here is 101.6 x 101.6 mm and is coated on one side with a 0.06 µm thick layer of chrome, which is recommended because of the small features of the master. The photomask used here was commissioned from an external photomask printing company.\nWithin a cleanroom, coat the chosen silicon wafer evenly with photoresist. As an optional step, surface-treat the wafer in a plasma asher before coating it with resist.\n\tNOTE: Here, 100 mm diameter wafers are used. Treatment in a plasma asher makes the wafer more amenable to binding to SU-8 and helps prevent delamination of SU-8 from the wafer.\nPerform the following steps according to the photoresist manufacturer's instructions:\n\t\nSpin the coated wafer to create the desired feature thickness, varying the spin time based on the desired thickness and the type of resist. For a 5 µm thick SU-8 2005, divide the recommended spin program into the following three steps:\n\t\t\nCoat the wafer with photoresist by spinning at 500 RPM for 10 s with a ramp of 100 RPM/s.\nReduce the resist thickness to roughly 5 µm by spinning the wafer at 3,000 RPM with a ramp of 300 RPM/s for 30 s.\nSlowly decelerate the wafer after spinning by reducing the speed to 0 RMP with a ramp of 500 RPM/s for 1 s.\nPrepare the resist for UV exposure by baking it briefly on a 95 °C hot plate. Modify the time spent on the hotplate according to the desired thickness of the resist; baking time is 2 min for a 5 µm-thick SU-8 2005.",
    "Expose the resist to UV light to fully cure the desired features. Be wary of overexposure, as this can make SU-8 brittle and affect the overall quality of the resulting master.\n\t\t\nUse exposure energy of 105 mJ/cm2 for a 5 µm-thick SU-8 2005. Based on the power of the available UV lamp, calculate the exposure time by dividing the exposure energy by the power of the lamp in mW.\n\t\t\tNOTE: As the lamp used here has a power of 8 mW, the exposure time should be 13.1 s.\nTo set the SU-8 features following development, bake again on a 95 °C hot plate, this time for 3 min. Wait for the desired features of the master to appear within 1 min during this baking step if the resist was exposed properly.\nRemove uncured SU-8 from the silicon wafer using SU-8 developer. Be thorough when removing the uncured SU-8, as it can get stuck between the micron-sized and spaced features on the wafer.\n\t\tCAUTION: SU-8 developer is a flammable skin and eye irritant; keep it away from heat/flames/sparks and use protective gloves and eyewear when handling it.\nAfter development, rinse with acetone to remove excess developer on the wafer and dry it completely with a nitrogen spray gun.\n\t\tCAUTION: Acetone is a flammable skin and eye irritant; keep it away from flames/sparks and use protective gloves and eyewear when handling it.\nOptionally, for SU-8 2005, bake on a 200 °C hot plate for 10 min.\n\t\tNOTE: This hard bake adds mechanical strength to the photoresist.",
    "After being allowed to cool, put the wafer into a wafer carrier tray and then cast it in PDMS. First, complete a silanization treatment on the wafer to make the SU-8 features of the silicon master less likely to bind to PDMS and thus less likely to be removed from the surface of the wafer.\n\t\nTo complete the silanization surface treatment, place the master and a small glass coverslip inside a desiccator designated for use with silanes only. Place 1-2 small drops of Trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane onto the coverslip, close the desiccator, and run it under vacuum for 30 min at a pressure of 4,500 Pa24.\n\t\tCAUTION: Trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane is a flammable skin and eye irritant; keep it away from heat/flames/sparks, use protective gloves and eyewear when handling, and work under a fume hood.\nTurn off the vacuum and leave the master and coverslip in the desiccator for another 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The master is now ready for casting in PDMS.\n2. Subtractive microcontact printing\nMix PDMS in the correct ratio of curing agent to base based on the manufacturer's instructions. Let it sit at room temperature and pressure for 15 min; then, degas under vacuum for 15 min.\nPour the PDMS into the master and put it into an incubator set to 37 °C overnight to cure.\nRemove the master from the incubator and allow it to cool to room temperature.\nWhile the master is cooling down, sonicate 25 mm coverslips in ethanol for 10 min. Use as many coverslips as the number of stamps being prepared.\nThoroughly rinse 25 mm coverslips with deionized (DI) water and dry using a filtered air gun.",
    "Plasma treat the coverslips for 1 min using a plasma cleaner under vacuum on high (radio frequency power of 30 W). Be sure to release the vacuum slowly after treatment to prevent the coverslips from moving inside the chamber.\n\tNOTE: Plasma treatment of the glass surface serves two purposes: it cleans the surface of the glass to remove contaminants and generates oxygen-based polar groups on the surface of the glass to make it hydrophobic25. This hydrophobicity makes the surface of the glass more amenable to protein binding.\nIn a room devoid of direct sunlight/overhead lighting, coat each coverslip with 100 µL of fluorescent-labeled protein solution at a concentration of at least 100 µg/mL, cover for extra protection from light and let it sit for 20 min.\n\tNOTE: Here, fibronectin isolated from human plasma and dyed with AlexaFluor 488 is used.\n\t\nTo dye fibronectin, combine unlabeled fibronectin of known concentration and volume with the appropriate amount of fluorescent dye in a 1.5 mL tube. Cover the tube with aluminum foil to protect the dye from light and incubate it at room temperature for 1 h, mixing gently every 10 min by turning the tube upside down 5-10 times.\n\t\tNOTE: The amount of dye required varies based on the dye used and the mass of protein being used. See Supplemental File 1 for the calculator used to determine the appropriate amount of dye for fibronectin labeled with Alexa 488. According to the manufacturer's instructions, excess dye can be filtered out with the use of desalting columns (see the Table of Materials).",
    "Rinse each coverslip thoroughly with DI water, and remove excess water from the surface by gently tapping the sides of each coverslip onto a paper towel or similarly absorbent material. Leave the coverslips uncovered in the dark for at least 30 min to allow them to dry completely.\nWhile the protein-coated coverslips dry, remove the PDMS stamp from the master by cutting it with a scalpel or other sharp blade.\n\tNOTE: It is best not to try and cut through the PDMS on the first attempt, as applying that much pressure will crack the silicon wafer and damage the master.\nPlasma treat the PDMS stamps for 2 min under vacuum on high (radio frequency power of 30 W).\nWithin a fume hood, place the stamps in a container with a lid and coat each stamp with a very thin layer (<100 µL) of 10% (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (3-APTMS) diluted in 100% ethanol.\n\tCAUTION: 3-APTMS is a flammable skin and eye irritant; keep it away from flames/sparks, use protective gloves and eyewear when handling, and work under a fume hood. Excessive coating of 3-APTMS solution will cause an orange film to form later in this process. This 3-APTMS surface treatment incorporates the amine functionality into the surface of the PDMS stamp, which will allow for further derivatization of the surface of the stamp later on26.\nCover the container with the stamps and allow them to sit at room temperature for 5 min.\nUsing DI water, thoroughly rinse each stamp on both sides.\nPlace the stamps in a clean container and coat them liberally with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in DI water.",
    "CAUTION: Glutaraldehyde is toxic; use protective gloves and eyewear when handling and work under a fume hood). This glutaraldehyde treatment alongside the previous 3-APTMS treatment provides aldehyde functionalities on the surface of the PDMS stamps, which can react with the amine groups in the proteins to create a secondary amine linkage, which is critical to the protein removal process27.\nCover the stamps, let them sit at room temperature for 30 min, and then rinse thoroughly with DI water again. Remove excess water from the surface of stamps in the same manner as the coverslips, and allow the stamps to dry uncovered for ~30 min.\nAfter 30 min, check if both the protein-coated coverslips and the stamps are dry. If either is not completely dry, use a filtered air gun to dry them completely, ensuring that the coverslips are not exposed to light for an extended period.\nOnce both the coverslips and stamps are dry, push the stamps pattern side down onto the coverslips with enough pressure so that the stamps come in full contact with the surface of the coverslip. Leave the stamps in contact with the coverslips for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: Due to the covalent amide bond between the glutaraldehyde stamp with the protein layer on the glass coverslip-which is much stronger than the weak hydrophobic interactions between the protein layer and the glass coverslip-the proteins should peel off the glass according to the pattern on the PDMS stamp once it is removed.\nAfter 15 min, carefully peel the PDMS stamps off the coverslips.\n\tNOTE: If the removal process worked correctly, the stamps should not come off the coverslips with no resistance but should also not be so firmly stuck to the coverslips that they cannot be removed without excessive force.",
    "Check the fidelity of the patterned coverslips using the appropriate filter on a fluorescent microscope (depending on which fluorescent dye the proteins are marked with).\nUse the patterned coverslips immediately or save and store them away from direct light.\n3. Activated coverslips\nNOTE: The bottom coverslips for use in the experimental chamber for PAA gels are made in this step. This bottom coverslip is specially treated to allow the PAA gel to remain securely adhered to as the top patterned coverslip is removed during the patterning process. Similar techniques are also described elsewhere10,12,15,28.\nSonicate 30 mm coverslips in 100% ethanol for 10 min, rinse with DI water, and then thoroughly dry with a filtered air gun. Prepare up to 6 coverslips at a time per batch in a 6-well plate.\nPlasma treat the coverslips for 1 min on high (radio frequency power of 30 W) and then place each coverslip into a well of a 6 well plate.\nCoat each coverslip with a very thin layer of 5% APTMS in ethanol in a fume hood.\n\tNOTE: An orange residue will form in case of excessive coating in this process.\nCover the 6-well plate and let the coverslips sit for 5 min.\nRinse the coverslips (both sides) and the inside of each well thoroughly with DI water and remove excess water inside the wells.\nPlace the coverslips back in the 6-well plate and add approximately 2 mL of 0.5% glutaraldehyde in DI water.\nCover the 6-well plate and let the coverslips sit in the glutaraldehyde solution for 30 min; then, thoroughly rinse both the coverslips and the wells of each plate with DI water.",
    "Store the treated coverslips in DI water within the 6-well plates for up to two weeks or use them immediately. Ensure the coverslips are completely dry before use.\n4. PAA gel fabrication and pattern transfer\nNOTE: Once patterned coverslips are made, they must be used to transfer those protein patterns to the PAA hydrogel soon afterward (<24 h)1,29,30. The following recipe is for a PAA gel with a Young's modulus of 3.6 kPa. The amounts of bis-acrylamide, acrylamide, and DI water can be varied to adjust the stiffness of the PAA gels12.\nJust before starting to make the PAA hydrogel precursor, remove the acrylic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-ester from the refrigerator so it can reach room temperature before being opened. Prepare an interchangeable coverslip dish set by sterilizing it with 70% ethanol and letting it sit under UV light in a biosafety cabinet for at least 30 min before use.\n\tCAUTION: NHS is a toxic skin and eye irritant; use protective gloves and eyewear when handling it, and work under a fume hood.\n\t\nAdd 1.25 mL of 40% acrylamide in DI water to a 15 mL conical tube.\n\t\tCAUTION: Acrylamide is a toxic skin and eye irritant; use protective gloves and eyewear when handling it, and work under a fume hood.\nAdd 175 µL of bis-acrylamide solution in DI water to the same tube (step 4.1.1).\n\t\tCAUTION: Bis-acrylamide is a toxic skin and eye irritant; use protective gloves and eyewear when handling it, and work under a fume hood.\nAdd 500 µL of 10x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\n\t\tCAUTION: PBS is an eye irritant; use protective gloves and eyewear when handling.\nAdd 2.915 mL of DI water.\nPipette 969 µL of this precursor into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube, and store the rest at 4 °C for up to two weeks.",
    "Measure out ~50-100 mg of ammonium persulfate (APS) in another microcentrifuge tube and dilute it in DI water down to 100 mg/mL; set it aside for use later. Open the NHS ester (now at room temperature) in the hood and carefully measure up to 3 mg of NHS in a microcentrifuge tube. Dilute the NHS-ester to 1 mg/mL in 1x PBS.\n\tCAUTION: APS is a skin and eye irritant; use protective gloves and eyewear when handling it, and work under a fume hood. Both APS and NHS-ester will hydrolyze over time, causing the activity of the chemicals in the stock solution to vary. Therefore, both these solutions must be prepared fresh every time (unlike the rest of the precursor).\nPerform the next three steps in a fume hood:\n\t\nAdd 2 µL of tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) to the microcentrifuge tube containing the 969 µL aliquot of PAA precursor.\n\t\tCAUTION: TEMED is a flammable skin and eye irritant; keep it away from heat/flame/sparks, use protective gloves and eyewear when handling, and work under a fume hood. TEMED is one of two crosslinking agents critical to the polymerization of the PAA hydrogel, the other being APS.\nAdd 15 µL of 1 M hydrochloric acid to decrease the pH of the hydrogel solution and avoid hydrolysis of the NHS-ester.\n\t\tCAUTION: Hydrochloric acid is a corrosive skin and eye irritant; use protective gloves and eyewear when handling it, and work under a fume hood.\nAdd 10 µL of the NHS-ester solution to the tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The NHS is critical to the patterning process. It will react with amine groups in the proteins on the patterned coverslip to form a stable amide bond, which will allow the pattern to be transferred from the glass coverslip to the surface of the PAA gel as it polymerizes31.",
    "Perform these final steps in a biosafety cabinet:\n\t\nCarefully place the 30 mm coverslip within the metal part of the coverslip dish set (3-APTMS and glutaraldehyde-treated side up) and screw the plastic ring on top. Set up the patterned coverslip so it can be easily reached in the next step, still protecting it from light as much as possible.\nPipette 5 µL of APS solution into the rest of the PAA precursor in the microcentrifuge tube, invert it to mix, and then immediately pipette 35 µL of that solution onto the 30 mm coverslip.\nDrop the patterned coverslip protein side down onto the solution, being careful not to create air bubbles in the hydrogel. Protect the hydrogel from light and allow it to polymerize for 90 min.\nOnce the hydrogel has polymerized, use a razor blade or scalpel to remove the upper coverslip, ensuring that the coverslip does not slide off the gel or fall back onto the gel once it has been removed, as this will ruin the pattern on the surface of the gel.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not leave the gel uncovered in an area with significant airflow (such as a biosafety cabinet).\nTo passivate any remaining NHS-ester in the hydrogel, add 2 mL of sterile PBS to the gel and incubate at 37 °C for 45 min. Immediately prepare the gels for experiments or store them overnight in sterile PBS at 4 °C until use.\n5. Imaging\nTo prepare for experiments with cells, turn on the heat (37 °C) and humidity (70%) in the microscope the afternoon before a planned experiment to allow the equipment inside the microscope chamber to equilibrate to the higher temperature.\n\tNOTE: This step minimizes the z-drift caused by temperature fluctuations.",
    "Just prior to the start of the experiment, turn on the chamber's CO2 source.\nTo prevent x-y drift caused by the repeated movement of the microscope stage during the experiment, fix the interchangeable coverslip dish set holding the cell-seeded hydrogel to the stage with double-sided tape.\nLook over the gel to find frames of interest to image, saving each stage position of the sections to be imaged.\nIn both the brightfield view and the fluorescent view corresponding to the labeled protein, set the microscope software to image each frame once every 5 min for 2 h.\n6. Image analysis\nNOTE: A system has been developed that can measure the deformation of the patterned PAA gels by determining the location of the traction points, interpolating the initial locations of the deformed points, and then calculating the cellular traction forces at each location. Any software system capable of performing image processing and numerical calculations can be used. The program aims to determine traction forces rapidly, eliminating user input and preprocessing procedures that would contribute to user-related errors. The code used here is available here as Supplemental Files 2-10, and these files, along with a pair of practice images, can be accessed at www.bu.edu/mml/downloads.\nIn an image processing software, open all individual images taken during a timelapse experiment from each microscope view used in order, from the first to the last image captured, and turn them into a single image stack (clicking on Image | Stacks | Images to Stack). Ensure that there are two separate image stacks: one of the brightfield view of the cells and one of the fluorescent view of the pattern to which they are attached.",
    "If there is drifting in the fluorescent images (i.e., the island of interest moves around in the x- and/or y-direction between each frame by >1-2 µm), first process the image stack with the StackReg plugin (P. Thévenaz, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne) to recenter each image in the stack based on the position of the first (clicking on Plugins | StackReg |Translation | OK).\n\t\tNOTE: This is critical because even sub-µm drift can significantly affect the final calculation of traction forces, especially on stiffer gels where this x-y drift is outside the range of expected noise. This code will save the images after drift has been removed, which can then be made into a new image stack to be analyzed.\nInput the brightfield and fluorescent image stacks into CTFTimelapse.m (Supplemental File 2).\n\t\nSpecify the file directory where the image stacks are located on line 7.\nOn lines 8 and 9, specify the names of the fluorescent image stack and the corresponding brightfield fluorescent stack, respectively.\nSpecify PAA gel stiffness (Pa):\n\t\t\nIn lines 11-14, which include a few different elastic moduli of PAA hydrogels used most often, comment out (type % at the start of the line) all but the elastic modulus of the gel in the images being analyzed. Alternatively, add the elastic modulus if not already present and comment out the rest (3658.19 Pa for test images).\nSpecify dot radius (m) on line 15 (1 × 10-6 m for test images).\nSpecify maximum possible dot diameter (µm) on line 16 (2.5 µm for test images).\nSpecify pixel ratio (µm/pixel):",
    "In lines 17-20, which include a few different image pixel ratios based upon imaging setups used previously, comment out (type % at the start of the line) all but the pixel ratio of the images being analyzed. Alternatively, add the pixel ratio used if not already present and comment out the rest (0.1613 µm/pixel for test images).\nOn lines 35 and 87, specify the file directory where the necessary image processing files are located.\n\t\tNOTE: From the fluorescent image stack, the code determines the location of each fluorescent dot and tracks the movement of each dot between each image in the stack20. The initial position of the microcontact printed points is known because they do not deform when properly transferred to the hydrogel32.\nWait for two figures and one dialogue box to appear once the program finds the dots. Use Figure 1 to ensure that the program has found the correct dots and did not find many dots where there were none. Use Figure 2 to choose the rectangular grid that helps the program locate and calculate cellular traction forces.\n\tNOTE: Figure 1 is the brightfield image of the cell with the dots found by the program (which will be red) overlaid over it (see Figure 3A). Figure 2 is an image displaying the same dots shown in Figure 1 but without the brightfield image in the background.\n\t\nWait for the dialog box to prompt to Press Enter After Selecting Point-wherein each point is one of the red dots found by the program-and has one large button inside it labeled Enter.",
    "Choose four different dots in Figure 2 to create a rectangular grid around and including the cell/cluster on that pattern. Select each dot one by one with a left click of the mouse and confirm it by pressing Enter on the button in the aforementioned dialog box. Keep count of how many dots are between the first and second dot as well as the first and third dot, as the program will ask for these values once all four-corner dots have been selected. Enter these values into the command window (type the number of dots and click the enter button on the keyboard when prompted to).\nOnce the rectangular grid is chosen, wait for the script to calculate traction forces that it finds within the grid based on the locations of the fluorescent dots. Note that the script first finds the displacement vector (u) of the geometric center of each dot and then calculates the corresponding traction force vector (F) using Eq (1):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63628/63628eq01.jpg    (1)\n\tWhere E is the Young's modulus of the PAA substrate, a is the radius of the fluorescent dot markers, and ν is the Poisson's ratio of the PAA substrate32. Eq (1) assumes that the substrate is an infinite elastic half-space, that traction forces are applied at the center of each circular dot marker, and that spacing between the dot markers is sufficiently large so that their respective displacements do not interact with each other23.",
    "NOTE: In the experiments described here, dot markers of radius a = 1 µm and 6 µm center-to-center spacing are used. Traction force arrows inside the cell/cluster pointing inwards toward the center of the cell should be present, while the area outside the cell/cluster should not have traction arrows present (see Figure 3C-E). Traction arrows pointing outward from inside the cell/cluster or many large traction arrows present outside the cell are indicative of a poorly chosen rectangular grid.\nOnce the correct traction field is found, select an appropriate region of interest (ROI) surrounding the cell/cluster, which includes all traction arrows within the cell using the cursor.\n\t\nTo draw the ROI, left-click as many times as necessary to draw a polygon shape with as many sides as desired, adjust the shape or move the ROI after it is drawn by left-clicking on the corners or edges, respectively. Once the ROI is drawn, double left-click to move on to the next image in the stack. Repeat this for all images in the brightfield stack.\n\t\tNOTE: The code will save traction force and displacement data for each time point in the same folder as the original image stacks, which can then be analyzed further.\nSubscription Required.
