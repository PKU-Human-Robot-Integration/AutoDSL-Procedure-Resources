    "RWG is a label-free biophysical technique that detects the change in wavelength of reflected light due to an event within 200 nm of the surface of the detector. For aggregation, this event would presumably be the formation of aggregates that interact with the microplate well at the surface of the biosensor plate.\nMaterials\nBuffer (see Critical Parameters)\nTest compounds and controls\nDimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; e.g., EMD Millipore MX1457)\nResonant waveguide grating optical biosensor instrument [e.g., Corning Epic BT or Perkin Elmer EnSpire (discontinued)]\nAssay plate, optical biosensor, 384-well with lid (Corning 5040) or 1536-well with lid (Corning 5090)\nFilter, 0.22-µm, 250-ml (e.g., Corning 430756)\nMultichannel pipette (e.g., ThermoFisher Scientific E1-ClipTip)\nPipette tips (e.g., ThermoFisher 94410150; ClipTip 384)\nReagent reservoir, 25-ml (e.g., VistaLab 3054-1005)\nMicroplate centrifuge (e.g., ThermoFisher Scientific Heraeus Multifuge X3 with TX-1000 rotor)\nSource plate, Echo-compatible, 384-well, polypropylene (e.g., Labcyte P-05525)\nLinear regression software such as Prism (GraphPad Software) or KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software)\nSpreadsheet software such as Excel (Microsoft Corporation)\nOptional: Acoustic dispenser (e.g., Labcyte Echo or Biosystems ATS)\nOptional: Liquid dispenser (e.g., Thermo Scientific Multidrop Combi or Formulatrix Tempest)\nData collection\n1. Turn on the RWG instrument 60 min prior to use.\n2. Dispense 30 µl of filtered buffer into each well of a 384-well assay plate.\nThis can be performed in a manual mode using a multichannel pipette (e.g., 384 ClipTip pipette; use a new tip after each dispense), or in automated mode using a liquid dispenser. 1536-well plates can also be used. For 1536-well plates, 8 µl of filtered buffer is dispensed into each well using a liquid dispenser.\n3. Centrifuge plate for 3 min at 336 × g (1200 rpm in a TX-1000 rotor), 20°C.\n4. Incubate plate at room temperature for 120 min in the RWG instrument.",
    "Insufficient incubation time will increase the variability in response (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.78#cpch78-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/890c40a0-046e-48c0-90dc-8ea399945943/cpch78-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nThe dependence of incubation time on wavelength shift and standard deviation of the wavelength shift in RWG. The response stabilizes in terms of both the value and standard deviation after a 2-hr incubation time for the baseline read prior to compound addition. After compound addition of DMSO at 1% (v/v), the response is stable after a 0.5-hr incubation. Measurements were performed in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, at a final DMSO concentration of 1% (v/v).\n5. Read buffer baseline.\nThe following settings are used on a Corning Epic BT when using a 384-well plate: Plate Type: CBA_384_2 mm; Avg/pt: 10; Data points: 4. The same parameters are used for a 1536-well plate, except the plate type is CBA_1536.\n6. Remove the plate from the instrument.\n7. Prepare compounds at a concentration of 10 mM in DMSO (e.g., EMD Millipore MX1457). Add 30 μl DMSO to columns 2-11 and 14-23 of a 384-well source plate. Add 60 μl of 10 mM stock compound to columns 1 and 13 and mix. Transfer 30 μl from column 1 to column 2. Repeat the transfer to the next column across the plate to column 11 to obtain an eleven-point, two-fold serial dilution of the compound. Repeat for columns 13-23. Place 30 μl DMSO in each well of columns 12 and 24 as negative controls. At least one eleven-point two-fold dilution should be of a positive control such as miconazole nitrate (e.g., Tocris 301, ≥99% purity by HPLC). This step can be performed at any stage, often prior to step 1.",
    "In addition to DMSO, a serial dilution series of fluconazole (e.g., Sigma F8929, ≥98% purity by HPLC), prednisone (e.g., Sigma P6254, ≥98% purity by HPLC), sulfadiazine (e.g., Sigma S8626, ≥99% purity by titration and thin-layer chromatography), and/or thalidomide (e.g., Sigma T144, ≥98% purity by HPLC) can be used as negative controls.\nThis step is best performed with an acoustic dispenser. Alternatively, multichannel pipettes can be used with 384-well plates.\nDMSO is hygroscopic.\n8. Centrifuge compound source plate for 5 min at 2103 × g (3000 rpm in a TX-1000 rotor), 20°C.\n9. Dispense 300 nl from the source plate (step 7) to the 384-well assay plate replicating the source plate layout [final DMSO concentration of 1% (v/v)].\nThis step is best performed with an acoustic dispenser. Alternatively, multichannel pipettes can be used with 384-well plates.\nMatching of DMSO concentration in the wells is needed to avoid a DMSO-dependent, rather than compound-dependent change in response.\nFor 1536-well plates, 80 nl of test compound is added to each well with an acoustic dispenser.\nOther plate layouts can be used.\n10. Centrifuge plate for 3 min at 336 × g (1200 rpm in a TX-1000 rotor), 20°C.\n11. Incubate plate for 60 min at 20°C in the RWG instrument.\n12. Read plate using the same settings as in step 5.\n13. Remove plate.\nDo not reuse plates.\nData analysis with linear regression\n14. Inspect the data. For an aggregating molecule, a shallow linear change in wavelength shift is expected below the CAC and a steeper linear change in wavelength shift is expected above the CAC (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.78#cpch78-fig-0001]). For a non-aggregating molecule, either no change or a shallow increase of less than 200 to 400 pm is expected for compounds in buffers containing 1% (v/v) DMSO.",
    "15. Fit the data below the CAC to a straight line (y1 = m1x + c1) and fit the data above the CAC to a second straight line (y2 = m2x + c2). The CAC is the concentration at which the two lines intersect and is calculated using the equation (c2 − c1)/(m1 − m2).\nAggregating compounds may exhibit a “hook effect” when measured using RWG, where the response increases in a concentration-dependent manner, and then decreases at the higher concentrations (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.78#cpch78-fig-0003]). The decrease is presumably due to very large aggregates or compound precipitation prior to dispensing. In such cases, the analysis concentration range can be truncated prior to the hook.\nCAC values determined by RWG using 384-well and 1536-well plates are statistically equivalent (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.78#cpch78-fig-0004]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/dda53b68-9c0b-48a5-a1db-ece7eafe8f3a/cpch78-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nThe hook effect. In this example, the response initially increases with concentration then decreases at concentrations above 12.5 μM.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f6a081dc-b2c4-41b0-900d-64790623b19c/cpch78-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nRWG assays in 384-well and 1536-well formats are equivalent as judged by a Bland-Altman analysis with all points within the 1.96 standard deviation, 95% confidence limit of agreement (dashed lines). CAC values were measured for five aggregators (clotrimazole, econazole nitrate salt, ketoconazole, miconazole nitrate salt, and nicardipine HCl) in 384-well and 1536-well plates. The y axis (Difference) is the CAC measured in a 384-well plate minus the CAC measured in a 1536-well plate. In addition, four non-aggregators (fluconazole, prednisone, sulfadiazine, thalidomide) exhibit no evidence of aggregation at either plate density. Measurements were performed in 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, at a final DMSO concentration of 1% (v/v).\nData analysis based on DMSO response",
    "16. Calculate the mean response plus six times the standard deviation for the control wells containing buffer and 1% (v/v) DMSO. This value is used as a threshold to determine if and at what concentration a compound is aggregating. Aggregating compounds will have a response greater than the threshold at one or more concentrations, whereas non-aggregating compounds will have a response less than the threshold at the tested concentrations. For an aggregating compound, the lowest tested concentration at which the threshold is crossed can be considered an estimate of the CAC.\nThis method is less labor intensive than linear regression fitting of each data set. However, the method can be subjective, as it depends on the standard deviation of the response, which varies with incubation time (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.78#cpch78-fig-0002]), and the data should be inspected to ensure that the six times standard deviation cutoff is reasonable. For data with a large standard deviation, a value of the average response plus three times the standard deviation may be more appropriate.\nThe standard deviation method can be used to identify potential aggregators for subsequent analysis with linear regression to obtain the CAC, i.e., to triage non-aggregators from more detailed analysis. This is particularly useful for larger datasets.",
    "DLS measures the fast (nanosecond) fluctuations of scattered light intensity by particles in solution as they diffuse due to Brownian motion, and determines the translational diffusion coefficient. The translational diffusion coefficient can be used to calculate the particle hydrodynamic radius (Rh) and size using equations derived from the first principles of classical physics (Stetefeld, McKenna, & Patel, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.78#cpch78-bib-0026]).\nMaterials\nEthanol\nNitrogen (N2) source\nTest compounds and controls\nDimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; e.g., EMD Millipore MX1457)\nAssay buffer (see Critical Parameters)\nDynamic light scattering (DLS) instrument (e.g., Wyatt DynaPro Plate Reader II, Wyatt DynaPro NanoStar, or Malvern Panalytical Zetasizer)\nAssay plate, 384-well, low-volume, non-treated, black with clear bottom (e.g., Corning 3540)\nFlashlight\nMicroplate centrifuge (e.g., ThermoFisher Scientific Heraeus Multifuge X3 with TX-1000 rotor)\nMultichannel pipette (e.g., ThermoFisher Scientific E1-ClipTip)\nPipette tips, ClipTip 384 (e.g., ThermoFisher 94410150)\nReagent reservoir, 25-ml (e.g., VistaLab 3054-1005)\nSource plate, Echo-compatible, 384-well, polypropylene (e.g., Labcyte P-05525)\nOptional: Acoustic dispenser (e.g., Labcyte Echo or Biosystems ATS)\nOptional: Liquid dispenser (e.g., Thermo Scientific Multidrop Combi or Formulatrix Tempest)\nSpreadsheet software such as Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corporation)\nDLS analysis software such as Dynamics version 7.8 (Wyatt Technology Corporation)\nOptional: Linear regression software such as Prism (GraphPad Software) or KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software)\nData collection\n1. Turn on DLS instrument at least 30 min prior to use and set temperature to 25°C.\n2. Clean bench with ethanol to remove dust particles.\n3. Place plate cover supplied with the assay plates on the bottom of a 384-well plate. In a fume hood, illuminate the plate with a flashlight and tilt plate to spot large dust particles. Remove any dust particles with 10-s bursts of N2.\nScratches on the glass bottom of microwell plates and dust particles cause large and artifactual light scattering effects.",
    "In-house generated nitrogen with an in-line filter may be used to remove dust particles. Aerosol products are also suitable.\nAfter cleaning, cover plate or place inside a plastic bag to avoid contamination.\nCheck manufacturer's specifications to ensure that the plate and lid are compatible with DMSO.\n4. Centrifuge compound stock solutions for 10 min at 14,000 × g (e.g., 12,000 rpm in a F45-24-11 rotor), 20°C.\n5. Dispense 30 µl of assay buffer into specified wells.\nThis can be performed in a manual mode using a multichannel pipette (e.g., 384 ClipTip pipette; use new tip after dispensing each time), or in automated mode using a liquid dispenser.\n6. Centrifuge the plate for 5 min at 583 × g (e.g., 1500 rpm in a TX-1000 rotor), 20°C.\nThis step removes bubbles that interfere with DLS.\n7. Prepare compounds at a concentration of 10 mM and dissolved in DMSO. Add 30 μl DMSO to columns 2-11 and 14-23 of a 384-well source plate. Add 60 μl of 10 mM stock compound to columns 1 and 13 and mix. Transfer 30 μl from column 1 to column 2. Repeat the transfer to the next column across the plate to column 11 to obtain an eleven-point, two-fold serial dilution of the compound. Repeat for columns 13-23. Place 30 μl DMSO in each well of columns 12 and 24 as negative controls. At least one eleven-point two-fold dilution should be of a positive control such as miconazole nitrate (e.g., Tocris 301, ≥99% purity by HPLC). This step can be performed at any stage, often prior to step 1.",
    "In addition to DMSO, fluconazole (e.g., Sigma F8929, ≥98% purity by HPLC), prednisone (e.g., Sigma P6254, ≥98% purity by HPLC), sulfadiazine (e.g., Sigma S8626, ≥99% purity by titration and thin-layer chromatography), and/or thalidomide (e.g., Sigma T144, ≥98% purity by HPLC) can be used as negative controls.\nThis step is best performed with an acoustic dispenser.

Centrifuge compound source plate for 5 min at 2103 × g (e.g., 3000 rpm in a TX-1000 rotor), 20°C.\n9. Dispense 300 nl of test substance from the source plate (step 7) into specified wells of the 384-well assay plate. Add 30 μl of buffer [final DMSO concentration of 1% (v/v)]. Place DMSO in each well of columns 12 and 24 and eleven-point two-fold dilutions of test compounds in wells 1-11 and 13-23 of each row.\nCompound addition is best performed with an acoustic dispenser. Alternatively, multichannel pipettes can be used.\nOther plate layouts can be used.\n10. Centrifuge plate for 3 min at 583 × g (e.g., 1500 rpm in a TX-1000 rotor), 20°C.\nThis step aids sample mixing and removes bubbles that interfere with DLS.\nVisually check the plates for bubbles after centrifugation. If bubbles are present, then increase the centrifugation speed and/or time.\n11. Check the bottom of the assay plate for particles, and spray with 10-s bursts of nitrogen to remove particles on the bottom of the assay plate if necessary.\n12. Place assay plate in DLS instrument for at least 15 min to allow plate to equilibrate to 25°C.",
    "To prevent evaporation during longer experiments (over 1.5 hr), it may be necessary to layer 5 µl silicon or paraffin oil on each well (e.g., Alfa Aesar A12728). If oil is used, then reduce the buffer volume to 25 µl, add 25 nl compound or DMSO, and then add 5 µl oil before the final centrifugation. It is important to ensure that oil does not touch the bottom of the plate, as this will adversely affect data quality.\n13. Collect DLS data. Example parameters for a DynaPro Plate Reader II:\n         \nNumber of times to measure each well: 1\nNumber of times to scan the selected regions: 1\nEnable Auto-attenuation: Yes\nAcquire an image of each well: Yes\nNumber of DLS acquisitions: 10\nTemperature: 25°C\nDLS Acquisition Time: 3 to 5 s.\nThe DLS acquisition time may be increased for large particles to ensure the signal decays to baseline during the acquisition time.\n14. Remove plate.\nDo not reuse plates.\nData analysis\n15. Open data in DLS software.\n16. Set cutoffs for data analysis between 1.5 µs and 1 s.\n17. Add data filter in the summary table to mask acquisitions with an autocorrelation intensity outside of the baseline limit of 1 ± 0.02.\nThis masks acquisitions with very large species and particles above the limit-of-detection of the instrument, and is particularly useful when analyzing large datasets. Depending on the instrument and data quality, the baseline limit may be relaxed to 1 ± 0.05.\n18. Mask acquisitions with no measured particles.\nThis will identify acquisitions with random noise around the baseline and no particles detected, such as those expected for buffer control wells (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.78#cpch78-fig-0005]). The hydrodynamic radius of these wells may be set to zero.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/45b143fb-c52a-421d-911a-39430330031d/cpch78-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",
    "Examples of acceptable DLS decays. (A) Expected autocorrelation function if no particles are present. Small, random values are observed that are distributed around 1 and do not change with time. This function should be observed for DMSO, buffer, or compounds below the CAC. (B) Expected autocorrelation function if discrete particles are present with a smooth decay to a value of 1. The data are for miconazole nitrate at concentrations of 100, 50, 25, 12.5, and 6.3 μM (top to bottom traces).\n19. Inspect the acquisitions for the DMSO/buffer and buffer-only control wells. Calculate the percentage of acquisitions with no measured particles. The autocorrelation function should center on a value of 1 and exhibit noise around the baseline (Fig. 5A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.78#cpch78-fig-0005]).\nIf ≥30% of the buffer/DMSO or buffer acquisitions contain particles, the experiment should be repeated with attention to filtration of both buffer and sample, and plate preparation, to remove dust or other particles.\n20. Inspect all compound acquisitions (autocorrelation plots and images if available) on a well-by-well basis. Acceptable data show an exponential decay to a value of 1 (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.78#cpch78-fig-0005]). Data should only be used in calculating the hydrodynamic radius (Rh) if the autocorrelation function exhibits the behavior of the example in Figure 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.78#cpch78-fig-0005]. Examples of data that should not be used are shown in Figure 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.78#cpch78-fig-0006]. Inspect the regularization fit for each acquisition to confirm goodness of fit.\nIf >70% of acquisitions in a well are particle-free, the hydrodynamic radius of the well may be set to zero.\nIf ≥30% of acquisitions in a well are masked due to the presence of very large particles, or if there is large variability between the acquisitions for a well, the well should be excluded from analysis.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/519a62c3-5909-4f7a-965d-6f23ae51d7ff/cpch78-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6",
    "Examples of unacceptable DLS decays. Panel A is an example of sample with large particles, panel B is an example of a compound with visible precipitate, and panels C and D are examples of multiple species with different masses.\n21. Determine the lowest compound concentration at which particles are observed in at least 70% of the acquisitions. This is the Lowest Aggregation Concentration (LAC).\n22. Alternatively, if the data are of sufficient quality, the Rh values can be analyzed with linear regression to calculate the CAC (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpch.78#cpch78-prot-0001], step 15)."
