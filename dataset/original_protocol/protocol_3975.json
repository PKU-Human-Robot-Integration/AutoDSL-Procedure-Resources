    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSeeding cells and supplementing with cytokines\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThe following steps are performed on “Day 0” and describe how to start T cell cultures using unfractionated PBMCs. PBMCs are stimulated by a cytokine mixture containing GM-CSF, IL-4, and Flt3-L, which support the development of distinct dendritic cell (DC) subsets (Parajuli et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Sterile reagents and aseptic technique should be used while performing the following steps.\nCryopreserve PBMCs.\nPrepare cryopreservation solution containing 90% human serum and 10% DMSO.\nSuspend isolated PBMCs at 5–25 million/mL concentration in cryopreservation solution.\nAliquot 1 mL of suspended PBMCs into cryovials.\nPlace cryovials into a cell freezing container, such as Mr. Frosty, and store at −80°C for 24–48 h.\nTransfer cryovials into liquid nitrogen for long term storage.\nThaw cryopreserved PBMCs.\nRemove cryovials containing cryopreserved PBMCs from liquid nitrogen storage.\nImmediately place cryovials into 37°C water bath.\nRemove vials from the water bath as soon as cells are almost thawed (typically <1 min) with a small pellet remaining.\nSpray the outside of the vials with 70% ethanol.\nTransfer the vials into a biological safety cabinet.\nTreat thawed cells with DNase I.\nAdd 25 μL of DNase I stock solution into 24 mL X-VIVO 15 media to obtain a final 1 μg/mL concentration (approximately 2 U/mL).\nDilute 1 mL thawed cells by adding drop by drop into 24 mL X-VIVO 15 media containing DNase I.\nResuspend PBMCs at 106 cells/mL in X-VIVO 15.\nCentrifuge diluted cells at 400×g for 10 min.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend cells in 5 mL X-VIVO 15 media.\nPass the resuspended cells through a 70 μm cell strainer.\nTake an aliquot and count the total number of cells.\nAdjust the volume of X-VIVO 15 media to obtain a cell concentration of 106 cells/mL.",
    "Note: If cells still appear clumpy, higher DNase I concentrations and/or longer incubation times may be adopted.\nSeed cells.\nTransfer 100 μL of the resuspended cells per well into 96-well U bottom plates to seed 105 cells/well.\nOptional: Freshly isolated PBMCs may also be used instead of cryopreserved PBMCs. We observed comparable assay performance using fresh or cryopreserved cells isolated from healthy donors and cancer patients, except, for certain cancer types freshly isolated cells yielded better results in which we detected greater IFN-γ or TNF-α expressing antigen-specific T cell frequencies after expansion. Therefore, while working with patient PBMCs, we recommend using freshly isolated cells, if available.\nNote: The total number of wells to be seeded can be determined by the user. We recommend seeding at least 10 wells (1×106 cells) per group to enable detection of rare T cell clones.\nPause point: Seeded cells can be kept 12–24 h at a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nAdd cytokines.\nPrepare 2× cytokine solution.\nTransfer 100 μL of the 2× cytokine solution into the wells containing 100 μL of cells, yielding the following final concentrations: 1000 IU/mL GM-CSF, 500 IU/mL IL-4, and 50 ng/mL Flt3-L.\nMix gently by pipetting.\nCulture cells for 24 h at a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nStimulating cells\nTiming: 3 h\nTiming will change based on the number of the antigens being tested.",
    "The following steps are performed on “Day 1”, using sterile reagents and aseptic technique. Here the goals are to induce the activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and to stimulate antigen-specific T cells. Adjuvants, namely Toll-like receptor agonists lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and R848, as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, are used to induce APC activation, thereby enhancing their capacity to stimulate T cells (Lovgren et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], Wesa and Galy, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Antigen-specific T cell expansion is achieved through stimulation of T cells by synthetic peptides. A single peptide or pooled peptides can be used depending on the experimental design. We have successfully used both short (8–12mers) and long (14-25mers) peptides. Routinely, we use pools of overlapping 15mers spanning the protein sequences of interest, which can elicit both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses, suggesting the feasibility of antigen cross-presentation in this assay system (Cimen Bozkus et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). In general, we pool less than 20 peptides in order to avoid potential peptide competition. However, we have successfully detected antigen-specific T cell responses with pools containing up to 125 peptides.\nStimulate cells.\nTransfer the plates into a biological safety cabinet.\nRemove 100 μL of solution from each well.\nAdd 100 μL of 2× adjuvant solution containing peptides into appropriate wells to obtain a final concentration of 10 μM R848, 100 ng/mL LPS, 10 ng/mL IL-1β and 1 μM of each peptide.\nCalculate the total volume of 2× adjuvant solution needed based on your plate design and prepare 2× adjuvant solution.\nDivide 2× adjuvant solution into separate tubes for each condition you are testing.\nAdd the peptides and the vehicle control into each tube.\nMix well.\nMix gently by pipetting.\nCulture cells for 24 h at a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.",
    "Note: We recommend using a multichannel pipettor while removing media or mixing the contents of the wells. Fresh tips should be used to avoid contamination between test conditions.\nNote: We recommend using 1 μM final concentration of each peptide even when added as pooled, though lower peptide concentrations may also yield successful results. We recommend not exceeding 20 peptides per pool to avoid peptide competition. However, investigators should conduct pilot experiments to identify the optimal peptide concentrations and number of peptides to be pooled.\nNote: To pool peptides, we combine equal volumes of individual peptides in a separate tube and mix well. It is important that each individual peptide included in the pool has the same concentration to assure equal representation within the pool.\nNote: In addition to negative controls to assess background, such as media alone or vehicle control (e.g., DMSO), and other experimental controls determined by the investigator, we recommend using myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and CEFT (previously defined MHC-I or II-restricted T cell epitopes from Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Influenza virus or Clostridium tetani) pools as negative and positive peptide stimulation controls, respectively.\nNote: If testing for the role of immune checkpoint blockade, blocking antibodies can be added at this stage supplemented in the 2× adjuvant solution together with the peptides.\nCritical: There is no need to centrifuge the plates as the cells will settle at the bottom following the 24 h incubation. However, please be gentle while removing the media at Step 8.b., also at Step 9.b., and do not disturb the cell pellet. As the cells will be in suspension, media exchanges may cause cell lost.\nFeeding cells\nTiming: 1 h\nTiming will change based on the number of plates being fed.",
    "The following steps describe how to feed T cells throughout the culture period using a cytokine cocktail containing IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15. This cytokine combination supports in vitro T cell expansion (Geginat et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Notably, here we switch to using R10 media, RPMI supplemented with 10% human serum, which aids T cell proliferation. Feedings are performed using sterile reagents and aseptic technique on “Day 2, Day 4 and Day 7”. However, feedings after “Day 2” can be performed on alternative days. We recommend feeding the cells every 2–3 d.\nFeed cells.\nTransfer the plates into a biological safety cabinet.\nRemove 100 μL of solution from each well.\nAdd 100 μL of 2× feeding solution to obtain a final concentration of 10 IU/mL IL-2, 10 ng/mL IL-7, 10 ng/mL IL-15.\nCalculate the total volume of feeding solution needed based on your plate design and prepare 2× feeding solution.\nMix gently by pipetting.\nCulture cells for 48–72 h at a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nNote: For the last feeding, we recommend using R10 media without the cytokines in the feeding solution. This might help reduce the background.\nRe-stimulating cells\nTiming: 6 h\nTiming will change based on the number of antigens and donors being tested.",
    "The steps below are performed on “Day 9” using sterile reagents and aseptic technique. In this section expanded T cells are re-stimulated with peptides they were initially stimulated with to induce effector cytokine production, which enables the identification and enumeration of antigen-specific T cells. If pooled peptides were used for the initial stimulation, here pools can be deconvoluted by re-stimulating the cells with the individual peptides constituting each pool, thereby demonstrating the immunogenic peptides within pools. For example, if on “Day 1” cells were stimulated with a peptide pool containing peptides a, b, and c, to deconvolute on “Day 9”, we re-stimulate these expanded cells with the individual a, b or c peptides in separate wells to evaluate the individual contribution of each peptide to elicited T cell responses. Furthermore, these steps can be leveraged to study cross-reactivity of T cells, for example T cells expanded following initial stimulation with mutant peptides can be re-stimulated with corresponding wild type peptides.\nHarvest cells.\nLabel tubes with the names of each test condition.\nTransfer the plates into a biological safety cabinet.\nMix the contents of each well vigorously by pipetting.\nCollect and transfer the contents of wells into appropriate tubes.\nCombine all replicate wells for each test condition.\nCentrifuge cells at 400×g for 8 min.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend the cells in R10 media.\nTake an aliquot and count the number of cells for each test condition.\nAdjust the volume of R10 media to obtain a cell concentration of 2×106 cells/mL.",
    "Note: We routinely resuspend cells in each test condition in 0.5–1 mL R10 media. To count, we make 1:10–1:100 dilutions of resuspended cells in trypan blue, depending on cell density. However, these suggested volumes can be modified according to total harvested cell numbers, which will depend on the initially seeded number of replicate wells and the rate of T cell proliferation.\nNote: Please refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section (problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]) for concerns regarding low cell numbers after expansion.\nSeed cells.\nTransfer 100 μL of cells per well into a new 96-well U bottom plate in triplicates for each test group to obtain 2×105 cells/well.\nPause point: Seeded cells can be kept up to 18 h at a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nRe-stimulate cells.\nCalculate the total volume of 2× re-stimulation solution needed based on your plate design with an extra amount to account for volume loss during transfer.\nPrepare 2× re-stimulation solution.\nDivide 2× re-stimulation solution into separate tubes for each test condition.\nAdd the peptides and control reagents into each tube appropriately and mix well.\nAdd 100 μL of 2× re-stimulation solution supplemented with peptides or control reagents onto appropriate wells containing cells.\nMix by pipetting.\nNote: Although the contents of 2× re-stimulation solution will be further diluted by the addition of peptides at Step 13.d., we consider this negligible since the added peptide volumes are exceedingly small (e.g., 1:5000 dilution or 0.02%).\nNote: We recommend using 1 μM final concentration of each peptide, same as in initial stimulation described in step 8, both when used in a pool or individually. However, lower or greater peptide concentrations may also yield successful results.",
    "Note: As an additional positive control, we recommend stimulating cells with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and ionomycin, which potently activates T cells independent of T cell receptor stimulation. We typically use PMA and ionomycin at a final concentration of 50 ng/mL and 1 μg/mL, respectively.\nCulture cells for 1 h at a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nAdd protein transport inhibitors.\nPrepare 11× protein transport inhibition solution and add 20 μL into each well.\nMix by pipetting.\nOptional: Although we utilize both monensin and brefeldin containing reagents in the protein transport inhibition solution, investigators can choose a single reagent to block protein transport that provides the optimal flow cytometric detection for their cytokines of interest. Furthermore, protein transport inhibitors may be supplemented in the 2× re-stimulation solution.\nCulture cells for 8 h at a humidified incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nNote: Investigators should perform pilot experiments to determine the optimal incubation time following peptide stimulation. We found that shorter incubation times yield better cell viability. However, detection of certain activation markers may require longer incubation times.\nOptional: If the minimal epitope and the restricting MHC information are known, tetramer staining can be utilized to detect reactive T cells. If performing tetramer experiments, re-stimulation steps can be skipped.\nAlternatives: If the goal is to determine the restricting MHC alleles for test peptides, alternative re-stimulation methods should be pursued. For example, cells can be re-stimulated by co-culturing them with peptide-pulsed antigen presenting cells that can be engineered to express desired MHC allele(s).\nStaining for flow cytometry\nTiming: 2 h",
    "The following details the staining method for flow cytometry to detect cytokine production by T cells. Here we investigate antigen-induced IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 production by CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. However, expression of various activation markers by different T cell subsets can be evaluated.\nMix pelleted cells by pipetting and transfer to V bottom 96-well plates.\nCentrifuge plates at 400×g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant.\nRapidly decant the supernatant by inverting the plates over a waste container.\nGently tap the plates on a paper towel to remove excess fluid.\nStain cells for viability and extracellular markers.\nPrepare the extracellular staining solution.\nCalculate the total volume of solution required including an extra amount to account for volume loss during transfer.\nAliquot the determined volume of PBS.\nAdd antibodies,anti-CD3, anti-CD4, and anti-CD8 at 1:200 dilution to obtain a final concentration of 1 μg/mL, 0.4 μg/mL, and 0.25 μg/mL, respectively.\nAdd viability dye at 1:1000 dilution.\nResuspend cells in 100 μL extracellular staining solution.\nMix well by pipetting.\nIncubate at 4°C for 20 min protected from light.\nWash cells.\nAdd 150 μL of PBS into each well.\nCentrifuge plates at 400×g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant.\nRapidly decant the supernatant by inverting the plates over a waste container.\nGently tap the plates on a paper towel to remove excess fluid.\nFix and permeabilize the cells.\nAdd 100 μL of Fixation/Permeabilization solution (BD) into each well.\nMix well by pipetting.\nIncubate at 4°C for 30 min protected from light.\nWash cells.\nAdd 150 μL of 1× Perm/Wash Buffer (BD) into each well.\nCentrifuge plates at 400×g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant.\nRapidly decant the supernatant by inverting the plates over a waste container.\nGently tap the plates on a paper towel to remove excess fluid.\nStain cells for intracellular proteins.",
    "Prepare the intracellular staining solution.\nCalculate the total volume of solution required including an extra amount to account for volume loss during transfer.\nAliquot the determined volume of 1× Perm/Wash Buffer (BD).\nAdd antibodies, anti-IFN-γ, anti-TNF-α, and anti-IL-2 at 1:200 dilution to obtain a final concentration of 0.25 μg/mL, 1 μg/mL, and 0.15 μg/mL, respectively.\nResuspend cells in 100 μL intracellular staining solution.\nMix well by pipetting.\nIncubate at 4°C for 30 min protected from light.\nWash cells.\nAdd 150 μL of 1× Perm/Wash Buffer (BD) into each well.\nCentrifuge plates at 400×g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant.\nRapidly decant the supernatant by inverting the plates over a waste container.\nGently tap the plates on a paper towel to remove excess fluid.\nResuspend cells in 200 μL PBS.\nStore cells at 4°C protected from light until ready to acquire by flow cytometer.\nPrepare single color compensation controls.\nLabel separate test tubes for each antibody used in staining for flow cytometry.\nVigorously vortex the beads.\nCombine 1 drop of beads, 200 μL PBS and 1 μL antibody in a test tube.\nMix and incubate at 4°C protected from light for 15–30 min.\nAdd 1 mL of PBS and centrifuge tubes at 400×g for 5 min.\nDecant supernatant and resuspend pellet in 250 μL PBS.\nStore cells at 4°C protected from light until ready to acquire by flow cytometer.\nAcquire and record data from experimental samples using a multi-color flow cytometer following fluorescence detector voltage and compensation setup.\nUse compatible software to analyze flow data, such as FlowJo.\nNote: Please refer to the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section (problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]) for concerns if a high background signal for cytokine production is detected in negative control cells.",
    "Alternatives: Here we use human antibodies from BioLegend and viability dye from Thermo Fischer Scientific for flow cytometry staining. However, antibodies and fixable viability dyes from other manufacturers may also be utilized."
