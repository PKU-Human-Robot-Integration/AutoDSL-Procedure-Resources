    "All procedures involving the care and use of animals were approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institute of Natural Sciences (16A074), and carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the National Institute for Physiological Sciences.\nNOTE: The original protocol was reported by Steven G. Shimada and Robert H. LaMotte4, and the present report describes these methods with several modifications, including the addition of a screen to prevent the animals from seeing each other, the absence of a mirror, the number of mice per recording, mouse strain, cage size, and recording time.\n1. Cheek Injection Model\nExperiment preparation\nCage\n\t\t\nSet four cages under a camera as shown in Figure 1. Set a screen to prevent the mice from seeing each other. Put in each mouse to each cage and set an acrylic lid to prevent escape of mice. Note that recordings should be performed in an environment in which temperature, humidity and sound are controlled.\nNOTE: Behaviors can also be recorded without a lid if the cage is sufficiently high.\nNeedle and syringe\n\t\t\nUse a 29 G or 30 G needle attached to a 0.5 mL syringe for the injection of test substances. If the test substance solution is highly viscous, larger needles are required. However, please note that large needles pose additional physical side effects.\nNOTE: A needle connected to a syringe with a polyethylene tube can be used.\nVideo camera\n\t\t\nUse a video camera having sufficiently large frame rates (30-60 frames/s) with relatively high resolution for the measurement of scratch bouts and wiping behaviors.\nSoftware for video analysis\n\t\t\nUse a video editing software for the video playback and analysis. Note that a fast-forward mode and a frame-by-frame playback mode are needed for precise analysis.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58943/58943fig1.jpg",

Before shaving, do not restrain the mice.\nNOTE: CD-1 or C57BL/6 mice were mostly used in this model4,5. In this article, male 6-12 week-old C57BL/6N mice were used. Note that sensitivity to the chemicals could be different between the various mouse strains3,6,7.\nOne day after shaving, move the mouse to the recording cage for 1 h to acclimatize it to the recording conditions. If a topical application is used, apply it during this acclimation period.\nNOTE: In this report, 10 μL of 2% (w/v) diphenhydramine hydrochloride salt in saline was topically applied 30 min prior to recording.\nSet a video camera above the cage, and start the video recording before the test substance injection. Inject a 10 μL solution of the test substance intradermally into the shaved cheek under awake conditions (Movie 2). After the injection, return the mouse to the recording cage.\nNOTE: In this report, 50 μg/10 μL histamine, 40 μg/10 μL capsaicin or vehicle (7% tween 80 in saline) were used as test substances.\nClose the lid of the cage and continue video recording for 30 min.\nNOTE: The total recording time will depend on the experimental conditions.\nBehavioral analysis",
    "Count scratch bouts and wiping behaviors, respectively. Mice raise a hind leg towards the cheek and scratch several times over one or a few seconds, then put their leg down. This series of actions is counted as one scratch bout. Scratching of other areas should not be counted. Mice use a single foreleg for wiping and both forelegs for grooming. These actions should be distinguished. Only wiping behaviors are counted as pain-related behaviors.\nNOTE: Each action is shown in Figure 2, Movie 3, Movie 4, and Movie 5.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58943/58943fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Typical mouse activity during recording. Panels A-C are illustrations representing wiping behavior with the right foreleg (A), scratching behavior with the right hind leg (B) and grooming behavior with both forelegs (C). Mice raise a hind leg towards the cheek and scratch several times over one or a few seconds, then put that leg down. This series of actions is counted as one scratch bout. Scratching of other areas should not be counted. Mice use a single foreleg for wiping and both forelegs for grooming. These actions should be distinguished. Only wiping behaviors are counted as pain-related behaviors. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58943/58943fig2large.jpg]\n2. Neck Injection Model\nInjection and recording\nOne day prior to the experiment, shave the fur on the nape of the mouse’s neck with hair clippers after approximately 5% isoflurane inhalation for 2-3 min.\nOne day after shaving, move the mouse to the recording cage for 1 h to acclimatize it to the recording conditions.",

Mice raise a hind leg towards the neck and scratch several times over one or a few seconds, then put that leg down. This series of actions is counted as one scratch bout. Scratching of other areas should not be counted.\n​NOTE: The action of scratching is similar to that in the cheek injection model, except that the location of the scratching is shifted to the neck."
