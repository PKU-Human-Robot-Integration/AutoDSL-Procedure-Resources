    "1. Preparative HPLC Purification of the Aβ40 or Aβ42 Peptide\nPrepare the following buffers for the HPLC purification.\nPrepare buffer A (20 mM NH4OH) by adding 1.3 mL of NH4OH (28% solution) to 1,000 mL of ultrapure water.\nPrepare buffer B (80% acetonitrile with 20 mM NH4OH) by adding 1.3 mL of NH4OH (28% solution) to a solution of 800 mL of HPLC-grade acetonitrile and 200 mL of ultrapure water.\nPrepare sample dissolution buffer (0.1% NH4OH) by adding 100 µL of NH4OH (28% solution) to 100 mL of ultrapure water.\nSetup the HPLC instrument as shown in Figure 1.\nFit the solvent bottles that contain buffer A and buffer B to the inlets of the HPLC pump using polymer tubing. Attach the polymer tubing to the HPLC pump with a one-piece fitting. Ensure that the polymer tubing of each buffer is fitted to the correct inlet valve of the instrument. Fit the HPLC pump with a degasser.\nCouple the HPLC pump with the inlet of the 300 Å 8 µm 25 mm х 300 mm preparative column (Figure 1B, far left column, see Materials List) using polymer tubing.\n\t\t\nAttach the polymer tubing to the preparative column with a one-piece finger tight fitting. Ensure that the polymer column is orientated in the correct manner.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The stationary phase of the preparative column is comprised of poly(styrene-divinylbenzene) particles. The correct orientation of the polymer column is marked on the outer casing with a single directional arrow.\nConnect the outlet of the column to the dual wavelength detector using polymer tubing and set the wavelength detector to 214 nm and 280 nm.\n\t\t\nAlter the wavelength by changing the detection wavelength parameters in the setup instrument method option of the built-in HPLC software.",
    "Attach the polymer tubing to the inlet of the wavelength detector with a one-piece finger tight fitting. Attach polymer tubing to the output valve of the wavelength detector. Attach the polymer tubing to the outlet valve of the HPLC detector with a one-piece finger tight fitting. This will be the sample collection tubing.\n\t\tNOTE: The lack of a strong chromophore on the Aβ peptide dictates that 214 nm be used as the primary ultraviolet (UV) wavelength for peak collection.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55482/55482fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Experimental setup of the HPLC instrument used for purification of the amyloid beta peptides.

Enter the purification method by changing the solvent timetable parameter (in the setup instrument method option built into the HPLC software). Turn on the HPLC pump by clicking the \"on\" button on the HPLC software.\n\tNOTE: The pump will begin supplying starting ratio of buffer A and buffer B through the preparative column and the HPLC instrument.\n\t\nLeave the system for 30 min to fully equilibrate.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nTime / min,% of Buffer Aa,% of Buffer Bb,Flow Rated / mL min-1\n0,80,20,6\n45,75.5,24.5,6\n45.01,80,20,6\n52.01,80,20,6\n52.02,73,27,6\n85,73,27,6\n92,5,95c,6",

Sonicate the sample for 30-60 s at room temperature and at a frequency of 40 kHz to aid dissolution.\nInject the entire sample onto the HPLC column using a 5 mL plastic syringe fitted with a 16-gauge stainless steel needle. Run the purification method as outlined in sub-step 1.3.\n\t\tNOTE: The system enables sample injection to be done through the use of a manual injector fitted with a 10 mL stainless steel injection loop (Figure 1D). The desired Aβ peptide will elute between 72 and 74 min as a sharp resolved peak (Figure 2C).\nCollect the sample into a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube. Confirm the identity of the Aβ peak through direct injection mass spectrometry of the collected eluent.11 Store the eluent for up to 12 h at -20 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Storage of the solution for periods longer than 12 h is not advised due to the potential for oxidation of the peptide.",
    "Isolate the purified peptide by flash freezing the collected aliquot/aliquots of the Aβ peptide in liquid nitrogen and lyophilize. Perform lyophilization by freeze-drying the sample at a temperature of -60 °C and a pressure of 20 mTorr for a period of 24 h.\nRun the analytical HPLC protocol as outlined below to determine the purity of the Aβ peptide. Store peptides in their lyophilized form at -20 °C for a period of up to 6 months.\n2. Analytical HPLC Analysis of the Purified Aβ Protein\nPrepare the HPLC buffers as outlined in sub-section 1.1. of the above protocol.\nSetup the analytical HPLC as per step 1.2.1 and as depicted in Figure 1 with the 4.6 × 250 mm analytical column (Figure 1B, far right column) and the manual injector with 20 µL stainless steel injection loop (Figure 1C) fitted to the instrument.\nProgram the HPLC software to run the analytical method as shown in Table 2 following instructions similar to those in step 1.3.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nTime / min,% of Buffer Aa,% of Buffer Bb,Flow Rate / mL min-1\n0,95,5,1\n30,50,50,1\nTable 2: Timetable for the HPLC purity analysis of the Aβ peptide. aBuffer A - H2O with 20 mM NH4OH; b80% MeCN / 20% H2O with 20 mM NH4OH.\nPurity analysis of the Aβ peptide\nPrepare a 1 mg/mL solution of the purified peptide through dissolution of the peptide in the sample buffer solution.\n\t\tNOTE: The buffer recipe can be found in sub-section 1.1. Protein concentration is determined by measuring the protein absorption at 280 nm (A280nm).12 The molar extinction coefficient (ε) used to determine concentration is ε = 1,490 dm3 mol-1 cm-1.13\nInject 20 µL of the 1 mg/mL (222 µM) solution onto the HPLC column and run the analytical method that was setup in step 2.3.",
    "NOTE: The remaining solution not used for analysis can be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized to recover the Aβ peptide. Lyophilization details can be found in sub-section 1.4.4. The Aβ peptide will elute from the analytical column between 16 and 18 min (Figure 2D). Use the built-in integration analysis software that accompanies the HPLC instrument to determine the purity of the Aβ peptide. Purity is determined by integrating each of the individual peaks on the spectrum and calculating peptide-peak percentage area. Typically, a purification of >95% should be ascertained.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55482/55482fig2.jpg",

For parts A, B and C the peak corresponding to Aβ42 is marked by an asterisk. Collection of the marked Aβ42 peak in part C reveals a purity of >95% as shown in part D. Mass spectrometry was used to determine the identity of the Aβ42 peak.
