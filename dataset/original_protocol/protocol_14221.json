    "1. Preparation of Cells\nPlate 20,000 cells in 2 mL of culture medium into each well of a 6-well plate using sterile technique in a biosafety cabinet.\nPlace 6-well plates in a humidified incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 24 h to allow the cells to adhere to plates.\n2. Preparation of Photosensitizer for Treatment of Cells\nPrepare 0.5, 1, and 2 mM 5-ALA solutions in culture medium. If fetal bovine serum (FBS) is an ingredient of culture medium, prepare and treat cells with 5-ALA in culture medium solution with 0.1% FBS for incubations.11,12 In this case, SCC-13 cells do not require FBS, so 5-ALA was added directly to keratinocyte serum-free medium supplemented with bovine pituitary extract and epidermal growth factor.\nAspirate the culture medium and wash the cells with at least 2 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nAspirate PBS and add 2 mL of 0, 0.5, 1, or 2 mM 5-ALA solutions into separate plates or wells.\nIncubate the cells with 0, 0.5, 1, or 2 mM 5-ALA on a 36 to 37 °C heating block for 30 min. Protect the cells from light exposure during incubation using aluminum foil.\nAspirate the 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 mM 5-ALA solutions and wash the cells with 2 mL of PBS.\nAspirate PBS and add 2 mL of culture medium for blue light irradiation.\n3. Blue Light Phototherapy\nBefore irradiating the cells, turn on the blue light device (e.g., light-emitting diode, fluorescent, or halogen light) and run for one cycle (1,000 s) to warm up the device. The blue light device should have an output wavelength of 417 +/- 5 nm. Allowing the device to run for one cycle before treatments ensures that the blue light wavelength and irradiance are consistent throughout the photoactivation phase.",
    "Use a photometer to measure irradiance at the cell surface. The blue light irradiance at the cell surface should be 10 mW/cm2. The distance between the light and the cells may need to be adjusted to achieve an irradiance of 10 mW/cm2 depending on the intensity of the light source.\nPlace 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 mM ALA treatment groups on a black surface under the blue light source. Irradiate the cells with blue light for 1,000 s (16 min and 40 s) for a total fluence of 10 J/cm2. Following blue light photoactivation, the cells are ready for analysis.\n4. Collection and Staining\nPrepare flow buffer according to manufacturer guidelines (see Table of Materials).\nAspirate culture medium and wash cells with 2 mL of PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and allow cells to detach for approximately 3 to 5 min. The cells may be examined under the microscope to confirm cell detachment.\nAdd 1 mL of culture medium (or PBS) with 10% fetal bovine serum to deactivate the trypsin.\nCollect cell suspension into labeled 5 mL flow tubes.\nSpin 5 mL flow tube in a centrifuge at 201 x g for 5 min. Aspirate solution without removing cell pellet.\nAdd 200 µL of flow buffer with conjugated annexin-V antibody (1 µL of annexin-v per 39 µL of flow buffer) to each sample.\nResuspend the cells and place in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 20 min to allow annexin-V binding.\nAdd 3 µL of 7-AAD to each sample. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\n5. Flow Cytometric Analysis\nFollow flow cytometer manufacturer guidelines for set-up (see Table of Materials).\nCollect and analyze samples with flow cytometry.13",
    "Perform statistical comparison of treatment and control groups using analysis of variance (ANOVA)14. Compare the means of the treatment groups to the mean of the control with a Dunnett's test for post hoc analysis."
