    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nImmunofluorescence staining specific for M2-like and total macrophage populations\nTiming: 2 days\nThe main purpose of this step is to obtain the binding between the first primary antibodies specific for i) the membrane receptor CD206, which is expressed mainly in the surface of macrophages with a M2-like phenotype; ii) the pan murine macrophage marker F4/80. This allows the characterization of the immune response profile in the studied tissues.\nIn order to succeed in the staining procedure, the steps of fixation, permeabilization and blocking of unspecific sites are crucial.\nRemove the selected slides from −80°C and allow them to reach room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 20 min.\nDraw 2–4 times the hydrophobic barrier around the sections using the hydrophobic marker PAP Pen and let the barrier dry completely for 5 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C). Do not draw too close to the tissue section and do not touch it while drawing the hydrophobic barrier.\nFixation\nPlace the slides in a slide-holder and cover completely the sections (∼400 μL) with cold acetone (stored at −20°C). Let it dry completely for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nNote: this step should be done under the chemical hood.\nRehydrate the tissue in 1× PBS for 10 min by placing the slides in a slide staining jar.\nPlace the slides in a slide staining jar and wash three times in 1× PBS under gentle shaking, for 5 min each wash (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Washing the slides, related to steps 2c, 3c, 5e, 6e, and 7e\nPermeabilization\nRemove excess PBS from the slides using a wipe (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). Do not touch the sections.",
    "Cover the sections with 100 μL permeabilization buffer and incubate for 30 min in a humidified chamber containing ddH2O at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nPlace the slides in a slide staining jar and wash three times in 1× PBS under gentle shaking, for 5 min each wash (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nBlocking\nRemove excess PBS from the slides using a wipe (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). Do not touch the sections.\nCover the sections with 100 μL blocking buffer and incubate for 30 min in a humidified chamber at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAddition of first primary antibody\nDilute the goat anti CD206 antibody (1:500 v/v) in blocking buffer.\nGently vortex the solution for 2 s at moderate speed.\nRemove excess blocking solution from the slides using a wipe (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). Do not touch the sections.\nCover the sections with 100 μL blocking buffer supplemented with anti-CD206 and incubate for 12–16 h in a humidified chamber at +4°C.\nPlace the slides in a slide staining jar and wash three times in 1× PBS under gentle shaking, for 5 min each wash. (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCritical: Sections must be covered by the solutions during all the incubation times to avoid drying out (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Wiping the slides, related to steps 3a, 4a, 5c, 6c, 7c, and 8a\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1015-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Designing of hydrophobic barrier and coverage of the sections\n(A) The hydrophobic barrier retains the liquid solution on the top of the sections. The tissue sections must be always covered.\n(B) The presence of the hydrophobic barrier allows to perform different stainings in tissues located in the same slide.",
    "Note: The usage of hydrophobic marker is strongly recommended to avoid the spreading of the staining solution throughout the slide. Moreover, the hydrophobic barrier can be useful to avoid cross-contamination, if different staining solutions are used next to each other in the same slide (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B)\nAddition of second primary antibody\nDilute the rat anti-F4/80 antibody (1:100 v/v) in blocking buffer.\nGently vortex the solution for 2 s at moderate speed.\nRemove excess PBS from the slides using a wipe (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). Do not touch the sections.\nCover the sections with 100 μL blocking buffer supplemented with anti-F4/80 antibody and incubate for 1 h in a humidified chamber at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nPlace the slides in a slide staining jar and wash three times in 1× PBS under gentle shaking, for 5 min each wash. (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nAddition of secondary fluorescent-conjugated antibodies\nDilute 1:1000 (v/v) the Alexa Fluor® 555-conjugated anti-rat and Alexa Fluor® 488- conjugated anti-goat secondary antibodies in blocking buffer.\nGently vortex the solution for 2 s at moderate speed.\nRemove excess PBS from the slides using a wipe (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). Do not touch the sections.\nCover the sections with 100 μL blocking buffer supplemented with secondary antibodies and incubate for 1 h in a humidified chamber at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nPlace the slides in a slide staining jar and wash three times in 1× PBS under gentle shaking, for 5 min each wash. (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nMounting\nRemove excess of 1× PBS from the slides using a wipe (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). Do not touch the sections.\nPlace one drop of VECTASHIELD® Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI on the tissue section.\nLay a microscope glass coverslip on the tissue section.",
    "Remove excess of VECTASHIELD® Antifade Mounting Medium with DAPI at the edges of the slide, avoiding to press the glass coverslip.\nFix the coverslip at the perimeters with nail polish.\nPause point: The mounted slides can be stored at +4°C for one week under protection from light prior imaging.\nNote: Fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies tend to form precipitates. It is recommended to vortex them prior usage to reduce the risk of fluorescent clamps in the staining procedure, which would interfere with the imaging process.\nMicroscopy imaging\nTiming: it varies according to number of samples and number of desired images for each sample\nAdjust the exposure time and gain of each channel blue (DAPI), green (CD206) and red (F4/80) to satisfy the dynamic range of the experiment.\nNote: The adjustment should be done from the sample having the highest intensity.\nOnce the settings are selected, acquire pictures of at least 5 representative fields from each sample on individual blue (DAPI), red (F4/80) and green (CD206) channels.\nMulti-channel images can be merged or separated, based on the visualization purposes. ImageJ/FIJI can be utilized for merging or separating the channels of the different pictures.\nCritical: It is important to avoid the overexposure of each fluorophore to prevent photobleaching which can compromise the fluorescent signal (it is not recommended to go longer than 1s for exposure time)\nNote: Fluorescent staining are not permanent. Therefore, it is recommended to acquire the images of all the samples in the same day to relate any variation of the signal intensity to biological relevance and not to fluorescence stability.\nPause point: described Images can be stored indefinitely prior to analysis."
