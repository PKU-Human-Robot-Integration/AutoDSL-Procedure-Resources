The length of the plasmid standard is L. Therefore, the relative molecular mass of the standard product is 2 × 330 × L. 6.02 × 1023 is Avogadro constant. So, the copy number of 2 × 330 × L g standard plasmid is about 6.02 × 1023.\nCalculate the number of copies of single-stranded DNA in each standard\nThe Ct value of each standard product as the independent variable x, and the logarithm of the copy number with base 10 as the dependent variable y, to fit the linear regression equation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).

Therefore, by observing the green fluorescence of the mouse liver, we can judge whether expression of the Cas9 protein in liver cells is successfully induced.\nDetect the green fluorescence of the whole liver.\nThe mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 4% chloral hydrate at a dose of 10 mL/kg.\nOpen the abdominal cavity of the mouse and remove the liver.",

Cut sections at a thickness of 4 μm.\nObserve the green fluorescence of liver slices with a fluorescence microscope.\nUse T7E1 assay to detect genome editing efficiency.\nDesign primers to amplify mouse genome sites targeted by the sgRNA.\nNote: We recommend that the length of the PCR product should be between 600 bp–1000 bp. Long PCR products will increase the difficulty of amplification. The distance from the cut site should be greater than 150 bp. Otherwise, it will be difficult to separate the undigested DNA band and the longer digested fragment through DNA gel, and the shorter digested fragment will also be blurry on the DNA gel.\nExtract genomic DNA from mouse liver.\nUse the primers to amplify the genomic sequence targeted by sgRNA.\nRun the PCR products on a 1% agarose gel. Cut the target DNA band and extract the DNA using a gel extraction kit.\nDenature the DNA at 95°C for 5 min, then slowly cool the solution 0.1°C/s to 25°C in a thermocycler.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1319_15.csv\nDigest the annealed DNA fragments with 0.5 μL T7 Endonuclease I (T7EI) enzyme at 37°C for 30 min.\nRun samples on a 1% agarose gel.",
