    "All experiments and animal care are conducted according to the Dutch Animal Experimental Act and conform to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health. The Animal Experiments Committee of the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, approved the current experimental protocol (permit number: 2014-041/3005).\n1. Housing and acclimatization\nUse 20–30 g wild type C57 black 6 (C57BL/6) mice (institutional breeding line described previously47), male and female, all more than 8 weeks old. House the mice in groups with a maximum of five per cage. In order to get used to human handling, let the mice acclimatize for at least 7 days. Do not perform any procedures during this period.\n2. Pulmonary artery banding surgery\nPreparation\n\t\nPlace the mouse in the induction chamber filled with 5% isoflurane/100% oxygen. Check for the lack of reflexes by giving a pain stimulus (i.e., toe pinch).\nShave the left hemithorax of the mouse using an electric shaver.\nGently pull out the tongue and hold with mild tension.\nIlluminate the inner throat by placing a light source on the exterior throat at the level of the glottis.\nIntubate the mouse endotracheally with a 20 G flexible cannula.\nPlace the animal on its right side on a heat mat (set temperature at 37 °C).\nConnect the cannula to the miniventilator and start ventilation with 1.5%–2.5% isoflurane/oxygen (180 breaths/min, tidal 250 μL).\nInject 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously for postoperative analgesia.\nPrevent dehydration of the eye using eye ointment.\nPulmonary artery banding surgery by left lateral thoracotomy\n\t\nPlace the mouse on its right side by placing the right foreleg in a neutral position, the right hind leg extended, and the left foreleg bent back.\nDisinfect the skin on the thorax with chloride-hexidine, swab 2x.",
    "Use sterile instruments for surgery. Open the skin with small scissors (round handle, 12 mm blades) from the left armpit parallel to the second and third rib.\nIdentify the m. pectoralis superficialis (oblique, superficial muscle) and the m. pectoralis profundus (oblique, underlying muscle).\nUsing suture loops, pull the m. pectoralis superficialis towards the ventral side and the m. pectoralis profundus towards the dorsal side of the mouse.\nOpen the second intercostal space and spread the ribs by using adapted paper clips, allowing the left heart ear, left lung, and the pulmonary artery to become visible.\nSeparate the arteria pulmonalis from the aorta. Place a suture loop around the pulmonary artery with a blunt 25 G needle that contains a 6-0 suture and place a lose 2-1-1 ligature around the arteria pulmonalis.\nPlace a 23 G needle parallel to the arteria pulmonalis within the 6-0 suture and first fix the most proximal suture knot and then distal knot of the 2-1-1 suture. Remove the 23 G needle. Make sure the knot is adequate.\nClose the thorax with two or three separate sutures with a monofilament polypropylene 5-0 suture. Release the m. pectoralis superficalis and m. pectoralis profundus.\nSuture the skin with a pure polyglycolic acid 5-0 suture. Use a continuous suture technique to minimize scar formation in the tissue; scar tissue will influence the image quality of the echocardiography.\nTurn off the isoflurane while continuing ventilation with oxygen during recovery from anesthesia until the mouse regains its own, spontaneous respiration as can be observed from movement of the abdomen.\nUncouple the endotracheal tube from the ventilator. Check for spontaneous respiration, extubate only when spontaneous respiratory action is visible. When spontaneous respiration is not seen, connect the tube to the ventilator again and return to step 2.2.12.",
    "Observe the mouse until it regains consciousness.\nSham surgery\n\t\nPerform the above procedure with the exception of the banding (steps 2.2.2–2.2.6).\nPostsurgical period\n\t\nHouse the mouse individually in an incubator (37 °C) for 24 h.\nObserve the mouse daily during the first 3 postoperative days. In case of any signs of discomfort, inject 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine subcutaneously 2x daily for postoperative analgesia.\n3. Echocardiography\nPreparation\n\t\nPerform PAB gradient analysis by means of echocardiography 14 days after PAB surgery.\nStart the echocardiography device. Choose the cardiac package and a 14.0 MHz transducer.\nAnesthesia\n\t\nPlace the mouse in the induction chamber filled with a mixture of 5% isoflurane and 100% oxygen.\nShave the thorax of the mouse.\nPlace the mouse on its back on the heat mat (temperature 37 °C) and place the snout in the ventilation mask.\nVentilate with a mixture of 1.5%–2.5% isoflurane and 100% oxygen (0.15 L/min) and room air (0.3 L/min).\nCheck the depth of the anesthesia by performing a toe pinch and adjust the anesthesia accordingly.\nPrevent dehydration of the eye by using eye ointment.\nDetermination of PAB gradient by echocardiography\n\t\nPlace pediatric electrocardiogram-stickers on each foreleg and one on both hind legs. Use the stickers to hold the animal.\nApply ultrasound gel to the shaved part of the mouse’s thorax.\nTo obtain the images of the pulmonary artery, two views can be used: the parasternal long axis (PLAX) or the parasternal short axis (PSAX) view. Obtain both and use the view that gives the best quality measurements and highest velocities for analysis.\nObtain PLAX and PSAX views.\nPress the color-Doppler button to visualize blood flow.\nPlace the ultrasound probe at a 30° angle to the parasternal line to obtain PLAX (for detailed description see Cheng, et al.48), visualizing the ascending aorta.",
    "Sweep the probe minimally towards the left so the ascending aorta disappears behind the pulmonary artery. The appropriate PLAX is identified when the pulmonary artery is visualized, with blood flowing vertically.\nPlace the cursor in line with the pulmonary artery. Press the continuous wave (CW) Doppler button to derive velocity time integral measurements during three cardiac cycles. Press Save.\nRotate the probe 90° clockwise from the PLAX to obtain PSAX, then tilt the probe slightly towards the cranial/ventral direction to derive the PSAX at the aortic level. The appropriate PSAX view is identified if the RV outflow tract is situated between the aorta and the probe. This continues in the pulmonary artery, with blood flowing vertically. For a detailed description see Cheng et al.48\nPlace the cursor in line with the pulmonary artery. Press the continuous wave (CW) Doppler button to derive velocity time integral measurements during three cardiac cycles. Press Save.\nMeasure the three maximum velocities of the best view (PSAX or PLAX) and calculate the mean. Use the simplified Bernoulli’s principle to derive the PAB gradient in millimeters mercury (mmHg).\n4. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging\nPreparation\n\t\nPerform CMR analysis 6 weeks (i.e., 42 days) after PAB surgery.\n\t\tNOTE: Additionally, earlier timepoints after PAB surgery may be chosen when multiple timepoints are to be included, depending on the research question. Later timepoints could be considered; however, RV failure and death may increasingly occur.\nUse a sufficiently powerful magnet (typically, >7 T is used for rodent CMR scanning). For the current protocol, a 9.4 T vertical system, with 1,500 mT/m gradient set and 89 mm bore size is used.",
    "Install CMR postprocessing software for analyzing volumes and masses in the derived images. The software is deemed appropriate if it allows manual segmentation to determine end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) volumes (EDV and ESV, respectively) and ventricular mass (measured both ED and ES).\nAnesthesia and fixation\n\t\nPlace the mouse in the induction chamber filled with a mixture of 5% isoflurane and 100% oxygen. Verify the effect of the anesthesia by giving a pain stimulus by a toe pinch.\nPut eye ointment on the eyes of the mouse to keep them moist during scanning.\nPlace the mouse in the scanner's animal bed with integrated air supply, a warmed (37 °C) mixture of 1.5%–2.5% isoflurane, 100% oxygen (0.15 L/min), and room air (0.3 L/min), and a pressure pad that enables observation of heart rate (aim for 400–500 bpm) and respiratory rate (aim for ~35 breaths per min) during scanning. Regulate the anesthesia based those two parameters. Make sure the bed is made of plastic, without any magnetic material.\nPlace the animal bed with the mouse into the scanner.\nPerforming cardiac magnetic resonance imaging\n\t\nMake preacquisition adjustments by tuning the radiofrequency (RF) birdcage coil on 1 Hydrogen (1 H) resonance frequency.\nThen set the magnetic field as homogeneous as possible using the automatic shimming procedure.\n\t\tNOTE: The computerized shimming is done by the so-called Tuning method, which uses the area under the 1 H FID as a quality parameter. In this Tuning procedure a user-defined group of shims (Z, Z2, X, Y, XZ, and YZ) is examined in an iterative cycle. Each shim in succession is adjusted individually to maximize the area under the FID. This is essentially a linear procedure that works well quickly.\nOptimize the RF pulse by maximizing the one-dimensional image profile with adjustment of RF pulse power.",
    "Assign the exact position of the heart in the scanner by making scout scans using a tripilot sequence. Use a fast gradient echo sequence to acquire the scout images through the thorax: a transversal, coronal, and sagittal slice. (Figure 1A,B,C)\nAdjust the axes to the actual axes of the axial, two-chamber, and four-chamber view (Figure 1D,E).\nSubsequently, position the cine slices perpendicular to an imaginary axis between the RV outflow tract and the utmost apical part of the RV.\nDerive ten to eleven 1 mm-thick cine slices without a slice gap to cover the entire top to base imaging of the RV (Figure 1F) by means of the Self-gated IntraGate-fast low-angle shot (FLASH) method, which obviates the need for an electrocardiogram (ECG) and respiratory gating. The acquisition parameters are displayed in Table 1. Save the images in DICOM format.\nPerforming analyses on acquired images\n\t\nDouble click on the software to open the program.\nOpen images in the CMR postprocessing software by using the import button.\nIdentify the end-systolic phase (defined as the phase with the visually smallest RV cavity) and the end-diastolic phase (defined as the phase with the visually largest RV cavity).\nAccording to guidelines from the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance49, draw the epicardial contours manually in end-diastole and end-systole from apex to base, by marking several points at the epicardial border of each image. At the last point, double click to complete the epicardial contour.\nDo the same for the endocardial contours. (Figure 2). The left ventricular and right ventricular EDV, ESV, ED mass, and ES mass are now automatically calculated by the software.\n\t\tNOTE: Mass is defined as myocardial volume times myocardial density (i.e., 1.05).",
    "Depending on the research question and population under study, index these variables for subject size by means of tibia length or body weight, according to previously published formulas50.\nCalculate the eccentricity index (EI) both in end-diastole and end-systole, by dividing the diameter of the LV cavity parallel to the intraventricular septum (IVS) by the diameter of the LV cavity perpendicular to the IVS, derived from the short axis at midpapillary level.\nThe software calculates the stroke volume (SV) in mL as imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60837/60837equ01.jpg, and ejection fraction (EF, %) as imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60837/60837equ02.jpg.\nCalculate the cardiac output (CO) in ml/min as imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60837/60837equ03.jpg. The heart rate is measured manually by the pressure pad embedded in the animal bed as described above, because the scanner is not able to register the high frequent heart rate adequately.\nDepending on the research question and population under study, index the CO and SV for subject size by means of tibia length or body weight, according to previously published formulas50.\n5. Statistical analyses\nOpen the software used for data visualization and statistical analyses.\nSort the data per group (PAB and sham) with every group in a separate column.\nUse the Mann-Whitney test to compare PAB versus sham for every variable.\nSubscription Required.
