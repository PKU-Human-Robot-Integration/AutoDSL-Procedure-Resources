    "1. Anesthesia and Pre-operative Procedures\nInduction of general anesthesia\n Approval by the appropriate Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee is obtained. Male C57/black mice, aged 10 weeks, are anesthetized. Deliver 4% isoflurane with 0.8 L/min oxygen to a Plexiglas box via an isoflurane vaporizer and place the mouse inside. Alternatively, if preferred by the surgeon, intraperitoneal anesthesia can be used.\nPreserving anesthesia\n After confirmation of anesthesia by lack of reaction to toe pinch, the mouse is put on the operation table in a supine position with a silicone mask. Isoflurane is decreased to 2% to maintain appropriate anesthesia level.\nHair removal\n Ventral hair is removed from the neck to lower abdomen using a hair remover. Hair remover is preferred because the hair that is left using a shaver may interfere with the Doppler ultrasound.\n2. Preoperative Ultrasound\nObjectives of the ultrasound\n Doppler ultrasound examination is performed prior to AVF surgery so as to record the base level findings that can be compared with post-operative findings to see anatomical and physiological changes.\nPoints of observation\n The jugular vein, supra- and infra-renal inferior vena cava (IVC), and abdominal aorta are examined using both pulse Doppler and B-mode.\nMeasurements\n Using the B-mode, diameter of each vasculature is measured. In addition, maximum velocity (peak systolic velocity in arteries) and waveforms are recorded in each of the measuring points described above.\n3. Operative Procedures\nMouse Preparation\nPrepare the incision site with a topical antiseptic and continue proper aseptic technique during the surgery including using a surgical drape, sterile gloves and instruments, etc.\nLaparotomy\n Midline abdominal incision is made from lower edge of the liver to just above the pubis.\nExposure of the aorta and IVC.",
    "A retractor is inserted and all of the bowels are pulled out of the abdominal cavity to the right side and kept wrapped in gauze soaked with saline. Dissect the membrane that connects the retroperitoneum and lower colon to get full view of the aorta and IVC. Apply pressure on the bladder if it is dilated and gets in way.\nExposure of the puncture site\n Puncture site will be between half to three quarters of the distance from left renal vein to aortic bifurcation. (Figure 1) Dissect the left margin of the aorta so that it can be punctured. Keep in mind that the aorta is positioned about 45 degrees behind the IVC and it must be dissected posteriorly in addition to the left. (Figure 2) The most important point of this surgery is not to dissect between the aorta and IVC. Keep far away from them.\nExposure of the clamp site of the aorta\n Dissect the infrarenal aorta from surrounding tissues. Be careful not to injure the IVC on the left and left renal veins with its tributaries on the right.\nClamping of the aorta\n Clamp the proximal aorta by applying microsurgery clips.\nRotation of the aorta\n By grasping the connective tissue surrounding the aorta, rotate the aorta so that the puncture can be made from slightly dorsal side of the aorta (Figure 2).\nPuncture of the aorta through to IVC\n Keeping the aorta in a rotated position, puncture the aorta through to IVC using a 25 G needle. (Figure 2) If successful, the needle can be seen through the thin IVC wall.\nHemostasis\n By pulling the retroperitoneal tissues, including the muscles, wrap the puncture site of the aorta. Do not compress the aorta against the IVC, as it may clot the AVF (Figure 3).\nDe-clamping the aorta",
    "After confirmation of the primary hemostasis, de-clamp the aorta. Additional bleeding may occur but it can be stopped with further compression described above. Upon de-clamping, arterial blood can be seen flowing into the IVC instead of dark venous blood flow.\nClosure of the abdomen\n Return the bowels into its natural position and close the abdomen.\n4. Post-operative Procedures\nPost-operative care\n After closure of the abdomen, isoflurane is stopped. Post-operative care including analgesia and wound care is applied in accordance with the instructions recommended by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For analgesia we use buprenorphine at 0.1 mg/kg intrasmuscularly every 12 hr for 24 hr following the surgical procedures.\nPost-operative ultrasound\n On the first day after operation, Doppler ultrasound is performed to confirm the AVF. In addition, other variables are measured to check the changes from pre-operative values.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
