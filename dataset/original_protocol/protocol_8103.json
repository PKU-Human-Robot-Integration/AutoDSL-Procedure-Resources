  "procedures": [
    "The following three TMS methods are described below. First, two methods are described to measure cortico-cortical connectivity using dual-site transcranial magnetic stimulation (dsTMS) while participants are either 1) at rest (resting state) or 2) performing an object-directed reach-to-grasp movement (task-dependent). Second, a cortical paired associative stimulation (cPAS) method is described to modulate the interplay between two brain areas in a controlled manner by pairing cortical stimuli (e.g., posterior parietal and primary motor cortices) to strengthen functional specific neural pathways with TMS and induce changes in cortical excitability. A representative data set is provided for each method. All the methods described in this protocol were approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. Participant Recruitment\nScreen all participants for any contraindications to TMS95,96,97,98,99,100 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) prior to recruitment. Recruit right-handed participants101 for experiments investigating functional connectivity in the motor system.\nInform each participant about the study objectives, procedures, and risks approved by the local institutional review board. Obtain written consent before allowing the individual to participate in the study.\n2. Electromyography (EMG) Electrode Placement\nInstruct the participant to sit comfortably in the experimental chair with both arms supported in a relaxed position. Provide a chin rest for participants during TMS to keep head movement to a minimum during stimulation.\nClean the skin over the muscle of interest with a mild abrasive. Using a belly-tendon electrode arrangement, place one disposable Ag-AgCl electrode on the belly muscle and another on a bony landmark nearby for a reference site on both hands of the participant. Repeat this step for each muscle of interest.",
    "Connect a ground electrode to the ulnar styloid process. It is important to inspect the level of surface contact of the electrodes with the skin throughout the duration of the experiment, because this precludes the impedance quality of the EMG signal. Placing tape over the surface electrode can improve the degree of contact with the skin surface.\n\tNOTE: For reach-to-grasp actions common muscles studied are 1) the first dorsal interosseous (FDI), 2) abductor pollicis brevis (APB), and 3) abductor digiti minimi (ADM) muscles of the hand.\nConnect surface electrodes with an EMG amplifier and a data acquisition system. Record and store the EMG signals from the amplifier to the data collection computer with EMG software for online monitoring and offline analysis of the EMG signal. Optionally, amplify the EMG signal 1,000x, and use a band-pass filter between 2 Hz and 2.5 kHz, digitized at 5 kHz by an analog-to-digital interface.\n3. Localizing Brain Areas for Targeted TMS\nMethod 1: Localizing without an MRI scan\n\t\nUsing the 10–20 EEG system mark C3, located approximately over the left primary motor cortex (M1), and P3, located approximately over a part of the angular gyrus in the left posterior parietal cortex (PPC), on the participant's scalp. Refer to methods previously described102 for specific steps to localize brain areas with the 10–20 EEG system (see Figures 3 and 4 from Villamar et al.102).\nAlternatively, an electroencephalography (EEG) head cap can be used to approximate the brain areas on the scalp. Place an appropriately sized EEG cap on the participant's head and align the Cz position on the cap with the marked Cz position on the participant's scalp. Mark C3 and P3 using the cap.",
    "NOTE: Localization without an individual's MRI scan has the potential to be inaccurate103. Therefore, MRI-based neuronavigation is strongly recommended to increase the accuracy and reliability of targeting the TMS. This can potentially lead to less variability in the TMS-induced aftereffects.\nMethod 2: Using an MRI scan\n\t\nBefore the TMS session, obtain the participant's structural MRI (T1). Upload the scan to a neuronavigation system.\nCreate a three-dimensional reconstruction of the brain and skin overlay using the neuronavigation software. Place markers on the anatomical landmarks at the tip of the nose, nasion, inion, and the preauricular notches of both ears. Do not use the tragus as it can shift when ear plugs are inserted.\nLocate the hand knob, the anatomical landmark that corresponds to M1104, in the left precentral gyrus. Place a trajectory marker at this point with the neuronavigation system. This point should be aligned 45° from the midsagittal line and approximately perpendicular to the central sulcus. Record and name the anatomical landmark with the neuronavigation system (Figure 1).\nLocate the nonmotor area of interest (e.g., over the anterior intraparietal sulcus area in PPC). Place a second trajectory marker over this anatomical landmark. Record and name the location with the neuronavigation system (Figure 1).\nPerform coil and head registration with the tracking system\n\t\nCalibrate both TMS coils with the calibration block separately using the neuronavigation system.\nPlace the head tracker securely on the participant's head so that the tracker is in view throughout the duration of the experiment.\nCoregister the anatomical landmarks on the participant's head to the neuronavigation system. If an MRI was not obtained from the participant, use a template MRI from the Montreal Neurological Institute.",
    "NOTE: It is important to not apply too much force with the pointer on the participant's skin to avoid discomfort and inaccuracies when performing registration. It may be valuable to check regularly throughout the course of the experiment that the head tracker has not shifted. These procedures ensure precision when applying the TMS coil to a target area for stimulation during the experiment.\n4. Localizing Optimal TMS Coil Position and Determining Thresholds\nNOTE: In this experiment, CoilM1 refers to the coil used to deliver stimulation to M1, while CoilTwo refers to the coil used to deliver stimulation to the other cortical area of interest (e.g., posterior parietal cortex). Thresholding over M1 must be determined for CoilTwo to calculate the maximum stimulator output (MSO) used over nonmotor areas. Motor threshold values should be reported to allow for comparisons and reproducibility across experiments.\nLocalizing and thresholding with CoilTwo\nPosition the center of CoilTwo over the target M1 location identified in the previous section to induce a posterior-anterior current direction in the brain.\nTo find the optimal location for activation of the target muscle, deliver pulses to M1 at 30% of the machine's MSO. Observe whether the delivered stimulation produces a muscle twitch and determine the amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP) recorded with the EMG electrodes from the muscle activity displayed by the data acquisition system.\nIf an MEP or a visible muscle twitch is not observed, continue to increase the stimulator output by 5% increments. The position, rotation, pitch, and yaw of the TMS coil may need to be adjusted to optimize the amplitude of the MEP. Repeat this until a response is observed.",
    "Lower the intensity in a stepwise manner to the lowest intensity that produces at least 5 out of 10 MEP responses with an amplitude of ≥50 μV while the participant is at rest97,98,105. This is defined as the resting motor threshold (RMT).\nEnsure for the duration of the thresholding session that both hands are in a resting position with both arms and hands supported with pillows.\nProvide real-time visual or auditory feedback of muscle activity from EMG (e.g., on a monitor or speaker) throughout the session, especially if there is excessive muscle activity (e.g., older adult populations).\nContinuously ask participant about levels of comfort.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important that all procedures described above are performed separately and repeated for each TMS coil to determine the specific parameters used in the experiment for the different sized coils (e.g., localizing optimal TMS coil position and determining stimulation intensities for motor thresholding). It also is important that the interval between the TMS pulses is >5 s to avoid inducing changes in cortical excitability.\nLocalizing and thresholding with CoilM1\nRepeat the steps described above to find the optimal stimulation location with the CoilM1.\nDetermine the lowest stimulator intensity needed to generate MEPs of ≥1 mV in 5 of 10 trials in the target hand muscle when the muscle is completely relaxed. Mark and record the position of CoilM1 using the neuronavigation system.\n5. Dual-site TMS (Resting State)\nUse two figure-8 shaped coils (e.g., CoilM1 and CoilTwo) connected to two individual TMS stimulators (e.g., two Magstim 2002 units). Deliver the test stimuli (TS) over M1 with CoilM1 (e.g., D70² figure-8 shaped coil, outside diameter of loop is 7 cm) and the conditioning stimuli (CS) to the other area of interest with CoilTwo. (e.g., D50 Alpha B.I., outside diameter of each loop is 5 cm).",
    "Determine the percentage of the MSO intensity for the conditioning stimulus (CS) for CoilTwo.\n\tNOTE: The percentage of the MSO intensity is often between 70–140 of RMT and will depend on the specific parameters and objectives of the experiment (see Table 3 from Lafleur et al.14). For this experiment, the CS was set at 90% of RMT, similar to parameters used elsewhere35,44,60.\nFor the test stimulus (TS), use the previously determined intensity that elicits MEP amplitudes of ~1 mV in the targeted quiescent hand muscle.\nSet the precise interstimulus interval (ISI) between the CS and TS.\nUse the supplied control software or external control via TTL pulses to control the ISI for the two pulses. The ISI often ranges from 4–20 ms (see Table 1 from Lafleur et al.14). For this experiment, the CS to PPC preceded the TS to M1 by an ISI of 5 ms.\nUsing a custom-made coding script, generate in random order the single-pulse TMS trials (TS alone) and paired-pulse TMS trials (CS-TS) at the specified ISI.\nPosition CoilM1 over the left M1 and position CoilTwo over the other area of interest.\nDeliver the TS alone trials with CoilM1. For the paired-pulse (CS-TS) trials, deliver the CS with CoilTwo followed by the TS to CoilM1 at the predetermined ISIs. This is illustrated in Figure 2. Repeat a minimum of 12 trials for each condition. Deliver the TS at least 1 s after the start of the trial to collect prestimulus EMG activity. Use a 4 s data acquisition sweep for each trial followed by a 1 s intertrial interval.",
    "If necessary, adjust the TMS coil positions slightly to accommodate the placement of both coils over the selected targeted locations on the participant's head. Adjust and record the new location of CoilM1 and CoilTwo using the neuronavigation system accordingly.\nUse the trigger button on the TMS machine for the supplied control software or the custom-made coding script from the external controller to deliver the programmed TMS pulses.\n\tNOTE: For this experiment, a data acquisition system (e.g., CED Micro 1401) and software package (e.g., Signal version 7) were used to generate stimuli, capture data, control the external equipment, and run the analysis. The custom-made coding scripts used to run and analyze data from the experiments are available from the corresponding author.\n6. Dual-site TMS (Task Context)\nNOTE: Dual-site TMS also can be used to test whether functional connectivity at rest can be modulated by different task contexts.\nFollow the same method described in the section above to examine functional interactions between different cortical areas interconnected to M1, but during the preparatory phase of a task that engages the network (e.g., during the action plan for a grasp).\nDetermine the time course and a cortical area of interest (e.g., PPC) to study functional interactions with M1 during the preparation of a complex movement plan (e.g., object-driven precision grip or whole-hand grasp43,44,45,46,47,48,49,106) for selective hand muscles.\nUsing a custom-made coding script, generate in random order the timing of TS alone trials and paired-pulse trials (CS-TS) at a given ISI after the 'GO' cue during the reaction time period (plan phase) such that the MEP recordings are collected before the movement initiation (premovement period) for the task.",
    "Deliver single-pulse TMS (TS alone) or paired-pulse TMS (CS-TS) probes between 50 and 800 ms after the 'GO' cue47,49 during the action plan of complex hand movements. See Figure 3 for timing of an event-related trial for this experiment. The custom-made coding scripts used to run the timing of event-related trials are available from the corresponding author.\n\t\nBefore the testing session with TMS, have the participant perform the task for a minimum of 50 practice trials to establish a consistent reaction time. Encourage the participant to ask questions about the task to ensure reliable performance during the testing session with TMS.\nUse the custom-made coding script to deliver all combinations of single-pulse TMS (TS alone) or paired-pulse TMS (CS-TS) and task (e.g., grasp a smaller top or grasp a larger bottom object) during the reaction time period (plan phase) such that the MEP recordings are collected before actual movement initiation.\n7. Cortical Paired Associative Stimulation (cPAS)\nNOTE: This protocol involves delivering pairs of monophasic pulses to two different cortical areas over short periods to induce pathway-specific changes in synaptic strength between connections within the human brain. This approach is based on Hebbian principles of spike timing dependent plasticity107,108,109,110. Similar to dual-site TMS methods, cPAS is delivered with two TMS machines connected to two individual TMS coils over two different cortical areas (e.g., PPC and M1).\nUsing a custom-made coding script, generate 100 pairs of stimuli at 0.2 Hz (8.3 min duration each). For the experimental cPASTwo→M1 condition, deliver the first stimuli over the nonmotor area (e.g., PPC) with CoilTwo with a specified pulse intensity (e.g., 90% RMT) for 5 ms before the second stimuli over M1 with CoilM1 with a pulse intensity that elicits a MEP amplitude of ~1 mV in the targeted hand muscle.",
    "It is important to control for: 1) directionality of the connectivity (CTRLM1→Two); 2) timing (CTRLISI=500ms); and 3) stimulation site (CTRL Control site→M1) in separate sessions. For examples see72,74,111,112. The custom-made coding scripts for each cPAS condition are available from the corresponding author. The stimulation parameters (e.g., intensities and ISI) can be adjusted for different cortical areas. Refer to Table 2 from Lafleur et al.14 for a summary of plasticity protocols.\nUse the procedures described in previous sections to guide the precise location of the TMS coils.\nObtain baseline corticospinal measurements with CoilM1 (e.g., ~24 MEPs).\nRandomize the participants to one of four intervention groups: 1) cPAS Two→M1; 2) CTRLM1→Two; 3) CTRLISI=500ms; 4) CTRL Control site→M1.\nFor this experiment only the experimental cPAS Two→M1 condition was tested and the PPC was used as the area of interest. When performing multiple sessions on the same participant, it is important that each experimental session is separated by at least 48 h in a randomized order to prevent crossover effects. It also is important to repeat sessions within each participant at the same time of day to control for alertness.\nUse the custom-made coding script to deliver the specified cPAS condition.\nMonitor the muscle activity of the other (left) hand during the experiment with EMG to ensure the hand is fully relaxed during the protocol.\nObtain corticospinal measurements with CoilM1 (e.g., about 24 MEPs) at different times after cPAS (e.g., 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 min) to examine the time course of the TMS-induced effect on brain excitability.",
    "NOTE: The experimental protocol used here is shown in Figure 4. Most studies to date have focused on the motor system because the MEP is a reliable outcome measure. However, behavioral measures72,73,74 and functional connectivity strength with fMRI92,93 and EEG89,90 following TMS manipulation of associative plasticity can also be investigated. These methods can also be adopted for different cortical areas that do not include M1 as a cortical target.\n8. Data Processing and Analysis\nVisually inspect EMG data offline and discard any traces showing muscle activity in which the root mean square EMG activity in the muscles exceeded a background level of 10 μV during the 100 ms immediately before the TMS pulse to ensure the muscles were at rest59,113.\nSimilarly, discard any trials with EMG activity that coincide with the TMS pulse during the movement preparation period (e.g., 800 ms window47,49) in dual-site TMS task context trials to exclude anticipatory responses.\nFor each MEP trial, measure the peak-to-peak amplitude between the minimum and maximum values in mV in the time window between 50 ms before and 100 ms after the TS105.\nCalculate the mean of the MEP amplitudes in millivolts from the TS alone trials and the paired-pulse (CS-TS) trials for each participant. Calculate the mean across all participants. Report these values.\nNext, normalize the mean MEP amplitude from paired-pulse stimulation (CS-TS) trials from the unconditioned single-pulse (TS alone) trials for each participant and condition. Express the MEP amplitudes as a ratio to the baseline TS condition.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60706/60706equ01.jpg\nCalculate the mean across all participants.
