    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of metal-organic frameworks ZIF-8 templates\nTiming: 25 h\nThis section describes the standard procedure for preparing Metal-Organic Frameworks ZIF-8 templates, the method for removing unreacted monomers by washing, and the storage method.\nMix 40 mL of 1.02 mol/L Zn(OAc)2‧2H2O and 40 mL of 0.73 mol/L 2-MIM stock solution under stirring with a magnetic bar.\nStop stirring after completely mixing the component solutions.\nLet the mixture be at 25°C for 24 h to allow the ZIF-8 nanocrystal growth.\nCollect the formed ZIF-8 nanoparticles by centrifuging (12,850 × g), and wash three times with deionized water (DI water) and methanol, respectively.\nStore the synthesized ZIF-8 NPs in methanol before using, and measure their concentration.\nNote: Please ensure that the ambient temperature during each synthesis is the same, which is related to the size of the final nanoparticles. In addition, please adequately wash the nanoparticles under ultrasonic conditions until they are completely dispersed.\nPreparation of TA-stabilized mineralized precursor solution (MPS)\nTiming: 5 min\nThis section describes the preparation process of TA-stabilized mineralized precursor solution, focusing on the proportion of various reagents.\nTransfer 6 mL of TA aqueous solution to a 20 mL synthetic flask, in which a magnetic bar was added, and place the flask on a running magnetic stirrer.\nAdd 1 mL CaCl2 of solution and 1 mL of Na2O‧3SiO2 solution successively to the flask and stir thoroughly, the final molar ratio of TA: CaCl2: Na2O‧3SiO2 in the precursor solution is 1:1:1 (problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nCritical: TA is easy to oxidize after a long time, so the MPS solution needs to be used for the following experiments as soon as possible.\nPreparation of mineralized metal-phenolic frameworks (MPFs)\nTiming: 40 min",
    "This section describes the preparation process of mineralized Metal-Phenolic Frameworks, including the pre-treatment ZIF-8 nanoparticles, the reaction process, the subsequent washing process and the storage condition of mineralized MPFs.\nRemove the methanol solution containing 8 mg of ZIF-8 from the previously synthesized ZIF-8 methanol solution and place it in a centrifugal tube. After centrifugation (12,850 × g), collect the ZIF-8 nanoparticles and further clean them with DI water.\nCollect the ZIF-8 nanoparticles by centrifugation (12,850 × g), and disperse them into 8 mL of MPS solution under ultrasound.\nKeep the mixture stirred for 10 min and then centrifuge (12,850 × g) it to collect the MPFs nanoparticles Zn-MPFs@CS, which should be washed with DI water and methanol three times, respectively.\nStore Zn-MPFs@CS nanoparticles in methanol for the following characterization and experiments (problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2503-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Etching and biomimetic mineralization process of ZIF-8 in MPS solution\n(A) Photograph of MPS solution.\n(B) Photograph of Zn-MPFs@CS solution.\n(C) TEM image of Zn-MPFs@CS nanoparticles. Scale bar, 100nm.\nNote: When ZIF-8 is mixed with the MPS solution, the mixture solution quickly turns a cloudy brown color (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), which is a typical phenomenon indicating that ZIF-8 has been etched by TA. In addition, this customizable protocol is also feasible when the MOFs templates are replaced with ZIF-67 and HKUST-1, as well as change the CS precursors to calcium phosphate (CaP) precursors. The optimal molar ratio of TA:CaCl2:K3PO4 in CaP precursor solution is 3:3:2.\nPreparation of composite hydrogel\nTiming: 3 days\nThis section describes the preparation process of gelatin-chitosan hydrogel loaded with Zn-MPFs@CS, which will be used as a functional hydrogel for wound therapy.",
    "Dissolve 0.027g gelatin and 0.054g chitosan hydrochloride (the mass ratio is 1:2) in 1 mL of 1× PBS (these mentioned agents should be sterilized as described in steps 3–5 of the “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section), and the obtained solution keep stirred at 300 rpm for 36 h.\nDissolve 0.1 g transglutaminase (1,500 U/g) in 500 μL of 1× PBS, keep stirred at 150 rpm for 24 h, and filtered with a 0.22 μm filter.\nAdd 100 μL of sterile transglutaminase to the dissolved gelatin-chitosan solution which contains 100 μg of Zn-MPFs@CS for crosslinking for 45 min at 37°C.\nNote: Perform these procedures in Class II biological hood with standard aseptic technique.\nEstablishment of full-thickness skin defect model on rat back and therapy\nTiming: 21 days\nThis section describes how to establish a full-thickness skin defect model on the back of rats to evaluate the effect of wound healing and apply the composite hydrogel to wound therapy.\nAnesthetize Sprague Dawley rats at 7 weeks old (problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nPlace the rats in an animal anesthesia box.\nPlace cotton adsorbed with isoflurane or another suitable anesthetic in an anesthesia box until the rats are anesthetized before being moved to a clean operating table.\nRemove the back fur using a razor.\nUse 75% ethanol(v/v) to disinfect the expected location of the wound.\nCreate a full-thickness skin wound model (diameter: ∼15 mm) on each rat’s back with sterilized scissors and forceps, and take photos for archiving.\nSpread the compound hydrogel over the wound surface using a syringe.\nHouse each rat individually in a single cage after surgery (problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nFollow up on wound healing progress, record the wound size regularly and take photos for archiving (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2503-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Note: Please ensure that the distance between the camera and the operating table is the same when the size of the wound is being recorded, which is conducive to the statistical analysis of the size of the wound in the photos. It is necessary to classify and label the records and photographs collected at different points in time.\nRegenerated tissue pathology analysis\nTiming: 3–4 days\nThis section describes how to prepare tissue biopsy sections and analyze the healing quality of regenerated skin tissue by different staining methods.\nTissue processing.\nCollect regenerated wound tissue from each rat with sterilized scissors and forceps, and cut the tissue into two strips.\nPlace the tissues in the pre-filled 10% neutral buffered formalin container (problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nAfter being fixed for 48 h, embed the tissues with paraffin and Tissue-Tek O.C.T. (Optimum Cutting Temperature Compound), respectively.\nProcess the tissues overnight with different reagents following the tissue processor (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2503_4.csv\nChoose an appropriate size base mold and add some liquid paraffin into it.\nPosition the tissues onto the paraffin base mold for subsequent longitudinal sectioning of the tissue.\nPlace the base mold with the tissues on the cold plate at −10°C to solidify the paraffin, making sure that the tissues are pressed down and fully immersed.\nPlace the pre-labeled cassette on top of the base mold containing the tissue and fill the mold with additional liquid paraffin.\nLet the paraffin completely solidify before removing the paraffin block from the mold.\nTrim excess paraffin from the sides of the cassette with the Para Trimmer.
