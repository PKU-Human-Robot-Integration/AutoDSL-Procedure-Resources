    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMouse perfusion\nTiming: 30 min per mouse\nPFA perfusion is critical for isolating cells while maintaining their in vivo cell states.\nPrepare 30 mL each of ice-cold PBS, 0.5% PFA, and 2 M Glycine solution in 50 mL falcon tubes for one mouse and label them with “PBS”, “PFA”, and “Glycine”, respectively. Store the tubes on ice.\nNote: If processing multiple mice, a larger volume of solutions can be prepared in a beaker and stored on ice.\nSet up the perfusion pump with a speed of 70–80 rpm.\nNote: The pump is specifically designed to mimic the contraction of the heart so that the solution is not continuously pumped into the mouse.\nAnesthetize the mouse with 2,2,2-Tribromoethanol (Avertin) (250 mg/kg) through intraperitoneal injection.\nNote: Avertin is 1.25% in PBS. 125–300 mg is injected per kg of a mouse through intraperitoneal injection. We administer 600–800 μL of Avertin solution for a 2-month-old mouse. The mouse that weighs heavier or older may require more anesthetization reagent.\nAlternatives: Other anesthetization reagents can also be used. We used Pentobarbitone (20 mg/mL) as an alternative. 50–90 mg is injected per kg of a mouse through intraperitoneal injection.\nCritical: Only proceed to the next step when the mouse stops moving. Pinch the mouse on the sole to check whether it is fully anesthetized. Mouse that is not fully anesthetized may struggle during the perfusion process, influencing your operation. Wait longer or administer an additional dose of anesthetization reagent if needed.\nImmobilize the mouse with pins/needles on plastic foam. Open the chest and expose the heart for perfusion.\nMake an incision on the right atrium for fluid removal. Hold the heart with blunt-end forceps and pierce the heart near the bottom of the left ventricle with the butterfly needle. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).",

Example of stabilization of the perfusion setup\nPerfuse the mouse with PBS for 3 min or until the pumped-out solution becomes clear.\nPerfuse the mouse with 0.5% PFA for 5 min.\nNote: The heart will stop beating once perfused with PFA. The tail of the mouse will become rigid during the PFA perfusion.\nPerfuse the mouse with 2 M Glycine for 3 min to quench the PFA fixation.\nFACS sorting of SCs from PFA-perfused mouse\nTiming: 4 h\nPrepare a 10 cm glass petri-dish with 10 mL of wash medium for each mouse.\nDissect the hindlimb muscles and put them into the petri-dish.\nTransfer all muscles of a mouse to a fresh Petri dish (or use the lid of the initial one) and mince the muscles in the dissociation buffer until no large pieces can be seen.\nTransfer the minced muscle pieces to a 50 mL falcon tube with 10 mL of muscle dissociation buffer.\nSeal the tube with Parafilm and incubate them in a 37°C shaking water bath with agitation at 65–70 rpm for 90 min.\nAfter digestion, top up the tube to 50 mL with the cold wash medium.\nCentrifuge the cells in a swing-bucket rotor at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant down to 10 mL.\nAdd 1 mL of stock Collagenase II solution and 1 mL of stock Dispase solution. Resuspend the pellet with a 10 mL serological pipette. Triturate until the pellet is fully suspended.\nFill the tube to 30 mL with the cold wash medium. Seal the tube with Parafilm and incubate in a 37°C water bath with agitation at 65–70 rpm for 30 min.\nAfter digestion, use a 30 mL syringe and a 20-gauge needle to aspirate and eject the muscle suspension 10 times.",
    "Place a 40 μm nylon cell strainer on a new 50 mL falcon tube. Transfer the cell suspension to the new 50 mL falcon tube through the cell strainer.\nAdd 10 mL of wash medium to the original tube. Swirl to rinse and transfer it through the same cell strainer. Collect any remaining liquid on the underside of the strainer using a 200 μL pipette.\nTop up the tube to 50 mL with the cold wash medium.\nCentrifuge the tubes in a swing-bucket rotor at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Remove all the supernatant by aspiration immediately after centrifugation.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of wash medium. Transfer to the strainer cap attached to a 5 mL FACS tube. Gently tap the tube to facilitate flow-through.\nSet up the cell sorter following the manufacturer’s specifications with the 70-μm nozzle. The sorting does not need to be done at 4°C.\nCreate gates to collect the singlet GFP+ population into 500 μL of PBS in a 5 mL round-bottom FACS tube (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). The cells are ready for library generation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2769-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "Critical: Do not snap-freeze the cell pellet for ATAC-seq. Proceed the cells directly to the tagmentation steps. Cell pellets may be stored at 4°C for up to 3 days but it is not recommended. A comparison between ATAC-seq libraries generated from PFA-perfused SCs stored under different conditions is shown in Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B–2D.\nATAC-seq library generation from PFA-perfused SCs\nTiming: ∼20 h\n100,000 cells were collected for the tagmentation reaction.\nNote: Pre-cool PBS and Lysis Buffer on ice before starting.\nNote: The number of cells can be reduced to 50,000.\nCentrifuge the sorted cells at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\n(Optional) Gently remove the supernatant using a 200 μL pipette. Resuspend the cells with 50 μL cold PBS. Centrifuge at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nGently remove the supernatant using a 200 μL pipette. Resuspend the cells with 50 μL Lysis buffer and centrifuge at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCritical: The cell pellet is too little to be seen. Remember the orientation of the tube when you put it in the centrifuge. Do not touch the side where the pellet should be.\nNote: Using a white tip on top of the yellow tip on the 200 μL -pipette helps minimize cell loss.\nGently remove the supernatant using a 200 μL pipette. Resuspend the cells with a 50 μL Tagmentation reaction mix.\nIncubate the reaction mix at 37°C for 30 min in a thermomixer.\nAdd reverse crosslinking solution to the tagmented mixture. Incubate at 65°C with agitation at 1000 rpm in a thermomixer for 12–16 h.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2769_9.csv\nNote: Incubate with shaking allows better reverse crosslinking.\nPurify the tagmented DNA with a PCR Cleanup kit and elute in 10 μL elution buffer.\nPause point: Purified DNA can be stored at −20°C for days.",
    "Amplify the purified DNA for 5 cycles.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2769_10.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2769_11.csv\nAlternatives: Other PCR Mix reagents such as NEBNext High-Fidelity 2× PCR Master Mix can also be used.\nDetermine the cycle number with qPCR for library amplification (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2769-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Example of PCR cycle determination\nThe cycle number is chosen when the fluorescence intensity reaches 1/3 of the maximum intensity. Alternatively, the Ct value can also be used as the final cycle number. Usually 17–19 cycles are used for final library amplification.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2769_12.csv\nAmplify the rest of the previously PCR-amplified DNA with the additional number of cycles you chose based on the fluorescence intensity.\nPurify the DNA using AMPure XP beads with a size selection of 200 bp to 1 kb.\nEquilibrate AMPure XP beads to 20°C–22°C for at least 30 min beforehand and mix the beads thoroughly.\nTop up the PCR product to 50 μL with Nuclease-free water and add 27.5 μL of beads (0.55×). Mix well and incubate at 20°C–22°C for 10 min.\nCentrifuge briefly, then place the tube onto a magnetic rack for 2 min until the liquid becomes clear. Carefully transfer the supernatant to a new tube and discard the beads.\nAdd 32.5 μL of beads (1.2×) to the supernatant from the previous step. Mix well and incubate at 20°C–22°C for 10 min.\nCentrifuge briefly, then place the tube onto a magnetic rack for 2 min until the liquid becomes clear. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL freshly prepared 80% ethanol to the tube while on the magnetic rack without disturbing it. Incubate at 20°C–22°C for 30 s and discard the supernatant. Repeat this step once.\nCompletely remove the residual ethanol, and air-dry beads for 2 min while the tube is on the magnetic rack with the lid open.",
    "Remove the tube from the magnetic rack and add 21 μL of nuclease-free water or elution buffer to elute DNA. Mix thoroughly and incubate at 20°C–22°C for 5 min.\nCentrifuge briefly and then place the tube back onto the magnetic rack until the liquid becomes clear. Transfer 20 μL of supernatant to a new tube with no beads carry-over.\nThe library is sequenced in 2 × 100 bp paired-end mode with at least 50 M read-depth.\nAlternatives: The library can also be sequenced in 2 × 75 bp paired-end mode."
