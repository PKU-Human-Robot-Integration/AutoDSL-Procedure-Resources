    "1. Preparation of Reagents for Day 0 to Day 14 of the Protocol\nPrepare the following medium components:\nMake 100 mL of retinal differentiation medium (RDM) by adding 1 mL of 100x N2 supplement, 2 mL of 50x B27 supplement, and 1 mL of 100x non-essential amino acid (NEAA) to 96 mL of Dulbecco's modified essential medium/nutrient mixture F12 9 (DMEM/F12).\nMake 10 mL of 1 M nicotinamide (NIC) by dissolving 1.221 g of NIC in 8 mL of sterile water, vortexing, and bringing the volume to 10 mL with sterile water. Sterile filter the solution.\nPrepare the following growth factors and small molecules:\nReconstitute recombinant mouse noggin, human dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1 (DKK-1), and IGF-1 to 100 µg/mL each in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered solution (PBS). Aliquot as needed and store at -20 °C for up to 3 months.\nReconstitute FGF-basic to 10 µg/mL and recombinant human/mouse/rat Activin A to 100 µg/mL each in 0.1% BSA in PBS. Aliquot as needed and store at -80 °C for up to 1 year.\nReconstitute SU 5402 (FGF receptor-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and CHIR99021 (glycogen synthase kinase 3, GSK-3β, inhibitor) to 10 mM each in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). Aliquot and store at -20 °C for up to 1 year or 6 months, respectively.\nObtain the following for day 0 and/or day 14: 1x ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution (0.2 g EDTA per 1 L of PBS), 1X PBS -/- (PBS without calcium or magnesium, pH 7.4), 1x trypsin-like dissociation enzyme (TDE), DPBS (Dulbecco's PBS), RPE supporting medium (RSM), and Y-27632 dihydrochloride (use at 10 µM).\n2. Day 0: Day of Pluripotent Stem Cell Passage for Differentiation\nGrow stem cell colonies in feeder-free, serum-free conditions to approximately 80% confluence before passaging.",
    "NOTE: See discussion for details on optimizing this step.\nCoat a 12-well plate with extracellular matrix-based hydrogel (ECMH) as per manufacturer recommendations. Allow to set for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.\nAliquot the volume of RDM and PBS -/- needed for day 0 and warm in a water bath to 37 °C before adding growth factors . Bring EDTA to room temperature.\nAdd the growth factors necessary for day 0 to the warmed RDM with 10 mM NIC, 50 ng/mL noggin, 10 ng/mL DKK-1, and 10 ng/mL IGF-1.

Use a P10 pipet tip to manually remove the differentiated cells.\n\tNOTE: Fibroblastic cells between colonies as well as the opaque cells within colonies indicate differentiated cells to be removed. See discussion for details about differentiated cells.\nPassage a single well of a 6-well plate into 4 wells of a 12-well plate (1:4).\n\tNOTE: See discussion for details on passaging stem cells at this stage.\n\t\nAspirate the stem cell medium from the stem cells and wash the wells once with 2 mL of pre-warmed PBS -/-.\nAspirate PBS -/- and rinse each well three times with 1 mL of EDTA per well of a 6-well plate.\nGently tilt the plate and aspirate the EDTA. Do not agitate the plate in any way to avoid prematurely lifting the cells.\nAfter the third wash, add 1 mL of EDTA and incubate at room temperature in the hood for 3-5 min. Do not disturb the plate during this incubation.",
    "Aspirate the EDTA and add 1 mL of RDM per well that will be seeded with 0.5 mL of extra medium. For example, wash 1 well of a 6-well plate with 4.5 mL of RDM to plate on 4 wells of a 12-well plate.\nUse a cell scraper to gently detach the cells. Collect all cells in a conical tube and triturate the cells in RDM by pipetting up and down 5 times. Dissociate large clumps of cells, but do not triturate to single cell suspension. Distribute the cells evenly in the pipet. Complete this step quickly to prevent reattachment to the plate.\nSeed cells on the ECM-coated 12-well plates (1 mL of cell suspension per well).\nTilt the plate back and forth to distribute the cells evenly throughout the wells. Gently place in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until the next medium change.\nNote the exact time. Change medium at the same time each day.\n3.

Wash twice with 1 mL of pre-warmed DPBS per well.\nAdd 0.5 mL of TDE per well of a 12-well plate and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Use a cell scraper to gently remove the cells from the plate. Use a P1000 pipet to gently triturate the cell/TDE suspension by pipetting up and down 3-4 times to create a uniform suspension.\nDilute the cell/TDE suspension 1:10 in pre-warmed RSM, without Y-27632.

    "Aliquot the volume of DPBS and RSM needed and warm in a water bath to 37 °C. Bring TDE to room temperature.\nAspirate spent medium from wells and wash each well twice with 2 mL (10 mL) of pre-warmed DPBS.\n\tNOTE: Do not use 10 µM Y-27632.\nAspirate DPBS and add 1 mL (5 mL) of TDE. Place in incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5 min. After incubation, view cells on an inverted microscope to confirm the cells are contracting and detaching.\nUsing an appropriately sized cell scraper, gently remove the cells from the bottom of the well or flask.\nUse a P1000 tip (10 mL serological pipet) to gently triturate the cell/TDE suspension up and down 3-4 times to create a uniform suspension.\nDilute cell suspension 1:10 in RSM.

Creating an Intermediate Cell Bank: Cryopreservation of Passage 2 day 3-5 RPE",
    "NOTE: Cryopreserve cells while they are subconfluent (~50%) and have not regained pigment.\nBased on the number of cells, calculate the volume of cryopreservation medium with 10% DMSO needed to resuspend the cells at a concentration of 3x106 cells/mL.\nFollow steps 5.2 to 5.8. Resuspend the cell pellet in the cryopreservation medium with 10% DMSO to 3 x 106 cells/mL and transfer 1 mL of the cell suspension to 1.2 mL cryogenic vials.\nPlace cryogenic vials in a freezing container designed to cool at -1 °C/min and place at -80 °C overnight.
