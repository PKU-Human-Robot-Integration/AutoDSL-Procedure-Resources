    "Animal husbandry and experiments were performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the IACUC at the University of Nevada.\n1. Preparation of the Diaphragms and Phrenic Nerves from Transgenic Mice\nPurchase transgenic mice and oligonucleotide primers to genotype these mice.\n\tNote: The primers are listed on the “Information” page for each of these mice.\n\t\nBreed a 3- to 6-month-old mouse expressing one copy of the appropriate transgenic/knock-in Cre-driver allele and zero copies of the conditional GCaMP3/6 allele with a second mouse of the same age expressing one or two copies of the conditional GCaMP3/6 allele and zero copies of the Cre-driver allele.\nGenotype the pups and mark the ones that have both Cre and conditional GCaMP3/6 alleles—these will henceforth be called double-transgenic mice (e.g., Myf5-Cre, conditional GCaMP3)6.\n\t\tNote: This way, all data will derive from mice expressing one copy of both Cre and conditional GCaMP3/6 alleles. This is particularly important when adding in other mutant mice (e.g., knockouts) to these crosses.\nWhen the double-transgenic mice are of the appropriate age (e.g., postnatal day 0 or 5 [P0 or P5] or adult), euthanize the mice by decapitating them with scissors (for mice younger than P10) or by placing them in an isoflurane inhalation chamber—when they are no longer responsive to pinching the tail with a pair of forceps, they are ready for sacrifice.\nSacrifice the animal by decapitation with a pair of scissors.\nTransversely section across the entire animal just below the liver and just above the heart and lungs with iridectomy scissors.\nDissect away the liver, the heart, and the lungs, being careful to maintain a length of the phrenic nerve that is sufficiently long to be drawn into a suction electrode (i.e., 1 - 2 cm).",
    "Note: The left phrenic nerve can be identified as a white piece of tissue that enters the medial portion of the left diaphragm. It must not be cut when removing the lungs. The right phrenic nerve runs within a piece of fascia that also contains the superior vena cava and is thinner and whiter than the vena cava. Together, they both penetrate the right medial diaphragm.\nFurther remove the ribcage and the vertebral column, except for the thin ridge around the diaphragm.\nPlace the diaphragm and the phrenic nerve sample in a microfuge tube with Krebs-Ringer solution with 1 µg/mL 594-αBTX for 10 min in the dark.\n\tNote: This concentration of 594-αBTX labels ACh receptors (AChRs) without blocking their function (personal observation).\n2. Stimulation and Recording of the Muscle Action Potentials\nUsing minutien pins, immobilize the diaphragm by pinning it onto a 6-cm dish coated with silicone dielectric gel and filled with ~8 mL of oxygenated Krebs-Ringer solution and place it onto the microscope stage. Perfuse the diaphragm with more Krebs-Ringer solution (8 mL/min) for 30 min.\n\tNote: This rinses the unbound 594-αBTX, as well as equilibrates the tissue after dissection.\nMake a suction electrode according to the established methods7.\n\t\nAt 4X magnification, using a micromanipulator, move the suction electrode over the left phrenic nerve and apply suction by pulling out the barrel of a 5-mL syringe connected to the tubing that is attached to the suction electrode.\n\t\tNote: When successfully drawn into the suction electrode, the phrenic nerve is taut. Turn on the stimulator and stimulate the phrenic nerve by flipping the manual switch 1x.",
    "Ensure that the diaphragm contracts in response to the 1-Hz stimulation by visually examining it with brightfield illumination. If not, adjust the voltage by turning the voltage knob incrementally to achieve a supramaximal pulse, which can be verified by a visual examination of muscle contraction. If still not visible, blow out the nerve with the syringe and attempt to draw it in again by applying suction.\nTurn off the perfusion and add the muscle-specific myosin inhibitor BHC6 or the voltage-gated sodium channel antagonist µ-conotoxin8 to a final concentration of 100 µM.\n\t\nTo make 100 µM BHC, pipette 4 µL of 200 mM stock in DMSO and predilute it in 1 mL of Krebs-Ringer solution.\nRemove 1 mL of Krebs-Ringer solution from the dish.\nAdd the prediluted BHC, to the dish.\n\t\tNote: This predilution helps prevent the induction by undiluted DMSO of a non-transient fluorescent response in GCaMP3-expressing cells.\nWait 30 min and then, turn on the perfusion of fresh Krebs-Ringer solution for another 20 - 30 min.\nPrepare the recording electrode.\n\t\nWearing gloves, place a borosilicate filamented glass with an outer diameter (OD) of 1 mm and an inner diameter (ID) of 0.4 mm into a micropipette puller and tighten the dials to clamp it into position. Close the puller door.\nUsing a P-97 puller, program the following setting: heat at 900, pull at 120, velocity at 75, time at 250, pressure at 500, and no additional loops.\n\t\tNote: Resistance (R) is measured using software controls of the amplifier: the data acquisition software confirms resistance by solving the formula V = IR. The software controller passes a known current (I) (typically 1 nA) through the electrode and measures the change in voltage (V), thus enabling us to solve for R.",
    "For embryonic diaphragms, ensure that the resistance is near 60 MΩ, and for older diaphragms, 10 - 20 MΩ. Load the recording electrode with 3 M KCl.\nAt 10X magnification, lower the electrode into muscle, using a second micromanipulator on the opposite side of the stage as a stimulating electrode.\nUsing electrophysiological data acquisition software, wait until the resting membrane potential changes from 0 to -65 mV or below.\nStimulate at 1 Hz and verify the presence of a muscle action potential by checking for a large potential that exhibits a modest overshoot (potential that rises above 0 mV when it starts at -65 mV or below). Do not confuse stimulation artifact with an action potential.\n\tNote: Potentials are significantly longer in duration (~5 ms) than stimulation artifacts.\n3. Imaging of the Fluorescence of the Sample\nAt 20X magnification, locate the endplate band at the center of the muscle by looking for 594-αBTX–labeled NMJs under green/yellow light excitation (550 nm). Switch to the blue light excitation (470 nm) to image Ca2+ responses in muscle, motor neuron, or Schwann cells.\nIf desired, set up the image splitter with bandpass filters and a dichroic single-edge filter for the dual-wavelength imaging.\nIn order to calculate the maximal fluorescence (Fmax) exhibited by GCaMP3/6-expressing tissue, add 12 µL of 3 M potassium chloride (KCl) to the diaphragm preparations6.\n\t\nPerform experiments with the brightness bar on the lookup table bar set to 110% of the level at which the GCaMP3/6-expressing tissue exhibits saturation at 20X magnification, without binning in response to KCl.\nRecord at 20 frames per second to not miss any fast events.",
    "Stimulate with 1 - 45 s of 20 - 40 Hz of nerve stimulation by delivering a train of impulses using the suction electrode or add pharmacological agonists by bath application or by perfusion and collect dynamic fluorescent Ca2+ responses in one cell subtype together with the static 594-αBTX NMJ signal.\n\tNote: If tissue-specific red or far-red GECI or GEVI mice become available for use at the NMJ, they can be used to collect two dynamic signals reflecting two distinct cellular elements at the NMJ.\nWhen the imaging or electrophysiological experiments are finished because the desired results have been achieved, perfuse water through the perfusion lines and suck water 2x - 3x through the suction electrode to ensure that salts do not build up.\n4. Export and Analysis of the Data by a Standard Deviation Map of Fluorescence Intensity (SDiu16)\nRecord image sequences recorded as 16-bit TIFF stacks and load them into the desired imaging data analysis system for analysis.\nIn the software’s 8d file menu, select Image stack of interest and click to load.\n\t\nOnce the video loads, scan through the time to identify a section that has no cellular fluorescent activity.\n\t\tNote: This region will be used to create a background sample.\nHold Shift and click to draw a region of interest (ROI) box in the area identified as the background sample area.\nAfter creating the box, press the space bar to generate a plot of background activity change.\nRight-click the trace and select the assorted option to present the option to Dump ROI as text to make the trace as an xy coordinate text file.\nMoving back to the video of interest, scan again to identify the time region where the activity of interest is occurring.",
    "Using the middle mouse button, select this time region in the yellow time box.\nRight-click on the video and select Stack OPS and then Stat map option 5.\n\t\tNote: This will generate a standard deviation map (SD map) in the left window.\nClick on the SD map and then press the ] key 19x to apply the appropriate color heat map.\nRight-click the SD map and select STM load and save, which will present the option Save stm as tiff to save the SD map.\nThen, press the [ key 19x to return to a grayscale color map.\nPress C and then D to bring up density mapping tools. Using the left mouse button and the center mouse button, adjust the threshold to include all fluorescent activity shown in the SD map.\nPress C to close the density tools while maintaining the threshold settings.\nRight-click the SD map and select STM particles and then Find PTCLS.\n\t\tNote: This will identify individual cells expressing fluorescent activity.\nRight-click the SD map once more and select Create Particle ROIs.\n\t\tNote: This will superimpose the selected cells on the original video of interest.\nWhile holding Shift, right-click on any one of the now identified particle ROIs on the original video.\nSelect ROI Marker and Measure Int in ROI.\n\t\tNote: This will generate individual fluorescent activity plots for each identified ROI in the video of interest. These can be saved by right-clicking any one of these and selecting Assorted, followed by Dump ROI as text.\nFor detailed logic underlying these operations, please see the source code file9.\nSubscription Required.
