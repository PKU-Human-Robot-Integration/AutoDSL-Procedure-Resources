    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nImplant dual-port guide cannula\nPrepare mouse for surgery\nTiming: 10–15 min\nPrepare 8-week-old C57BL/6J male mice.\nNote: Animals are housed individually under specific pathogen-free conditions in a temperature controlled environment with either a 12 h: 12 h or 14 h:10 h light: dark cycle.\nAll animal procedures are performed according to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Washington.\nRecord body weight and calculate buprenorphine dosage.\nSet induction chamber to 2% isoflurane.\nPlace mouse inside the induction chamber for a duration of 2–5 min.\nOnce anesthetized, with an electric shaver, remove hair from the incision area on top of the head.\nApply eye lubrication to keep eyes moist during the surgery.\nSet surgical station isoflurane flow to 1%–2%.\nPlace mouse in stereotaxic apparatus by opening the mouth with non-sterile thick forceps moving the tongue out of the way, and placing the top teeth in the hole on the mouth plate. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1580-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Implant dual-port guide cannula\n(A) Stereotaxic apparatus and controller unit set-up for mouse to implant a guide cannula.\n(B) Stereotaxic holder containing a multiport guide cannula. Scale bar 1 cm.\n(C) Mouse skull with reference points bregma, lambda, bone screw placement, and red x denoting the cannula placement.\n(D) Mouse fixed in ear bar with guide cannula implanted targeting the third ventricle. Created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nPull the nose cone over the mouth.\nPlace the animal in the ear bars.\nTighten the nose cone and the ear bars to ensure the head is firmly in place.\nEnsure the depth of anesthesia by performing a toe pinch. The mouse should not react.\nSkin preparation\nTiming: 2 min",
    "Sterilize the shaved incision area with 3 alternating scrubs of betadine and alcohol wipes.\nBegin sterilizing scrubs along what will be the incision line in a circular motion and extend outward.\nImplant third ventricle cannula\nTiming: 20 min\nReplace gloves with sterile surgical gloves for surgery.\nUsing sterile forceps, place the guide cannula in the holder on the stereotaxic device to ensure the cannula tip is perpendicular, straight down by viewing it from multiple angles. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nConnect a 1 cm vinyl catheter to the osmotic pump port.\nSeal the end of the catheter by melting the tube close with forceps just removed from the hot bead sterilizer.\nUsing dog-tooth forceps in one hand, grasp the skin between the eyes. On the other hand, use a scalpel to make a small incision along the midline in the center of the head.\nUse cotton swabs to clean the skull and, by opening using lateral traction, the incision of the skin will stay open.\nUse the guide cannula to level the skull.\nMove the tip of the guide cannula to lambda (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C), touch the skull and zero all the coordinates on the controller by pressing reset.\nMove the guide cannula to bregma and touch the skull. Look at the Z coordinate to determine if the distance is within 0.1 mm, indicating the skull is level.\nOnce level, touch the tip of the guide cannula at bregma and zero all the coordinates.\nMove the guide cannula to the 3V coordinates -1.8 mm posterior to bregma and midline zero.\nMark the coordinate on the skull for the guide cannula (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nMove the guide arm out of the way.",
    "Drill three holes for the screws ensuring that the holes are from the sutures on the skull and screws will not block placement of the guide cannula (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nIt is important to use light pressure to drill through the skull to ensure drill bit doesn’t subsequently damage the brain by going too deep.\nImplant the screws, in one hand hold the curved forceps with a small bone screw. In the other hand, use the screwdriver to screw in the screws.\nCritical: Ensure the head is secure in ear bars to prevent any movement of the head while placing the screws.\nOnce the screws are in place, move the cannula back into place, touch the skull and ensure the guide cannula lines up with the mark made.\nDrill a hole for the guide cannula, then lower the guide cannula to -5 mm. The base of the cannula should be 0.3 mm off the skull surface.\nCoordinates for dual-port cannula.\nA/P: -1.8.\nM/L: 0.\nD/V: -5.00.\nIf bleeding occurs during guide cannula placement, use a sterile cotton tip applicator to apply light pressure until bleeding has stopped.\nCritical: The cannula is implanted directly through the superior sagittal sinus and therefore bleeding is expected. Direct pressure with a sterile cotton-tipped applicator applied for 1–2 min, or sterile gauze pads wrapped around the cannula can be used to stop the bleed. Ensure that bleeding has completely stopped prior to cementing the cannula in place.\nCement cannula in place (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nMix the acrylic and Ortho-Jet powder in a 1:2 ratio in a small plastic cup. Remove the needle on a 3 mL twist top syringe, fill the syringe with the acrylic solution and twist on the capped needle.",
    "Uncap the needle and squeeze the acrylic on the skull covering the 3 implanted screws fully and bottom ½ of the guide cannula.\nLet acrylic dry completely (approximately 10–15 min).\nRemove the cannula holder and ensure the cannula is not moving out of place.

Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nReturn animal to clean cage on a heating pad. Make sure the animal has access to water or gel and food.\nAllow the mouse to recover for a week before performing injections or implanting an osmotic pump.\nCritical: Standard Allentown shoebox cages are used for housing mice after surgery.

Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nDrop pump flow moderator and catheter into the sterile field.\nAdjust the metal tube in the flow moderator so that 3 mm is visible above the white cap.\nConnect the 3 cm catheter tubing to the flow moderator.\nFill one sterile 1 mL syringe with U0126 and a second 1 mL syringe with vehicle.\nConnect the filling needle to the 1 mL syringe.",
    "Insert the filling needle to the bottom of the pump. Slowly fill the pump while withdrawing the needle until a small bubble of liquid forms outside the pump.\nFill the catheter tubing-flow moderator from the catheter tubing end.\nInsert the flow moderator into the osmotic pump.\nPrime the osmotic pump in a sterile 15 mL falcon tube fully submersed in sterile saline solution at 37°C for 24 h.

The mouse should not react.\nClean the shaved incision area with three alternating scrubs of betadine and alcohol wipes.\nBegin along what will be the incision line in a circular motion and extend outward.\nDrape mouse with a sterile sheet containing a small window for the surgical area.\nImplant osmotic pump\nTiming: 5–7 min\nUse small scissors to make a small incision the diameter of the osmotic pump between the scapulae.\nCreate a pocket for the pump under the skin by gently inserting thick forceps into the incision the same length as the osmotic pump. Open and close the forceps to spread the subcutaneous tissue.\nInsert a filled pump connected to vinyl catheter tubing into the pocket with the catheter and flow moderator facing the guide cannula. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nThe pump should rest below the incision to one side of the spine.\nCarefully remove the tubing connected to the infusion port on the guide cannula using forceps.\nCut the catheter tubing from the osmotic pump to fit the length (ca. 3 cm) and connect tubing to the guide cannula. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nClose incision\nTiming: 2–5 min\nPlace 2–4 interrupted sutures, closing the skin around the catheter tubing. (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nInspect the incision site to ensure it is completely closed.\nAdminister icv injection\nAdminister icv injections\nTiming: 10 min\nPrepare icv injection Hamilton syringes for use, one for FGF1 and one for U0126.\nDrop the sterile icv tubing and the injectors into sterile field.\nConnect one end of icv tubing to the 10 ul Hamilton syringe and remove the plunger.",
