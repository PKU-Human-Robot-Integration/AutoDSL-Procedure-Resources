First round of biopanning: Screening phage clones that bind to the extracellular domain of FGFR2\nNOTE: Use aerosol-resistant pipette tips and wear gloves for all protocols in order to minimize contamination with environmental bacteriophages.\nPrepare a 10 µg/mL FGFR2 (Purity > 97%; see Table of Materials) solution in coating buffer. Add 1 mL of the prepared solution to a 35 cm2 dish and swirl repeatedly until the surface is completely wet. Incubate overnight at 4 °C with shaking.\n\tNOTE: To avoid selection of decoy target binders, the target protein must be highly purified.",
    "Inoculate 5 mL of LB + Tet medium with Escherichia coli (E. coli) ER2738 for 5–10 hours at 37 °C with shaking. The amplified ER2738 cells will be used for titration in step 3.3.\nPour off the coating solution from the dish (the excess solution must be removed) and add the blocking solution. Incubate at 4 °C for at least 1 h.\nDiscard the blocking solution and wash 6 times quickly with TBST (TBS + 0.05% (v/v] Tween-20). Avoid drying out the dish.\nReconstitute the original phage library in 1 mL of TBST [final concentration of 1011 plaque forming units (PFU)], add to the coated dish, and rock gently for 2 h on a shaker at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the dish 10x with TBST (TBS + 0.05% (v/v) Tween-20), as performed in step 2.4.\n\tNOTE: The unbound phages must be removed thoroughly by vigorous washing.\nElute the bound phage by adding 1 mL of 0.2 M glycine-HCl buffer (pH 2.2) to the dish and rocking gently for 10 min at room temperature.\nTransfer the eluate into a sterilized microfuge tube and neutralize it with 100 µL of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.1.\n\tNOTE: In step 2.6, remove the unbound phage as much as possible by washing the dish 10x vigorously. This is a crucial step. The eluted phage can be stored at 4 °C for one week. However, it is best to go forward to the next step as soon as possible.\n3. Titer determination of the eluted phages\nPre-warm LB + IPTG/X-gal plates for at least 1 h at 37 °C before use.\nPrepare 100 µL of 10-fold serial dilutions (i.e., 101, 102, 103 and 104) of the eluate from step 2.8 in LB. Use tips with filter cartridges to avoid contamination.",
    "Let the culture from step 2.2 reach mid-log phase (OD600 ≈ 0.5). Dispense 200 µL of the culture into sterilized microfuge tubes, one for each eluate dilution.\nTo initiate the infection, add 10 µL of each dilution from step 3.2 to individual microfuge tubes containing the E. coli ER2738 culture from step 3.3. Vortex quickly and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nCoat 90 μL of the mixture from step 3.4 into the LB +IPTG/X-gal plates with coating sticks.\nOptionally, melt top agar in a microwave, dispense 3 mL into sterile culture tubes, one for each eluate dilution, and maintain tubes at 45 °C. Transfer the mixture from step 3.4 to culture tubes containing 45 °C top agar. Mix quickly and immediately pour the culture onto a pre-warmed LB/IPTG/X-gal plate. Gently tilt and rotate the plate to spread the top agar evenly.\nAfter 5 min, invert and incubate plates overnight at 37 °C.\nCount plaques on plates with approximately 100 plaques. Multiply each number by the dilution factor for that plate to get the phage titer in PFU per 10 µL.\nInoculate another 5 mL of LB + Tet medium with E. coli ER2738 at 37 °C overnight with shaking for phage amplification.\n\tNOTE: Use the culture of ER2738 in mid-log phase (OD600 ≈ 0.5) for phage titer. If most of the plaques are white on X-gal/IPTG plates, it means that the pool of phage has been contaminated with wild bacteriophages. If contamination occurs, it is necessary to start again with the panning steps from the uncontaminated phage stock solution.\n4. Phage amplification\nDilute (1:100) the overnight culture from step 3.8 in 20 mL of LB in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Add the unamplified eluate and incubate with vigorous shaking for 4.5 h at 37 °C.",
    "Transfer the culture to a centrifuge tube and centrifuge for 10 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube, centrifuge again, and discard the pellet.\nTransfer the upper 80% of the supernatant to a fresh tube and add to it 1/6 volume of 20% PEG/2.5 M NaCl. Allow the phage to precipitate at 4 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: Mix the culture supernatant with PEG/2.5 M NaCl well.\nCentrifuge the precipitated phage at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.

Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a fresh microfuge tube and precipitate again by adding 1/6 volume of 20% PEG/2.5 M NaCl. Incubate on ice for 15–60 min. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant, re-spin, and remove the residual supernatant with a pipette.\nResuspend the pellet in 200 μL of TBS and centrifuge for an additional minute to remove impurities. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh microfuge tube to obtain the amplified eluate.\nTiter the amplified phage as described in section 3.\n\tNOTE: The dilution of the amplified eluate is higher compared to the unamplified eluate; serial dilutions of 108–1011 are typically suggested.\n5. Second round of biopanning\nRepeat sections 2 to 4.\nTiter the second round of the amplified eluate on LB + IPTG/X-gal plates as described in section 3.",
    "NOTE: Reduce the coating concentration of FGFR2 protein to 5 μg/mL. Use the amplified phage from step 4.7 as the input and keep the titer same as in the first round (1011 PFU). Shorten the incubation time of phage and FGFR2-coated dish to 1 h and increase the Tween concentration to 0.1% (v/v) in the wash steps.\n6. Third round of biopanning\nRepeat steps 2.1-2.6.\nElute the bound phage by adding 1 mL of 20 μM bFGF solution (a ligand for FGFR2) to the dish and rocking gently for 60 min at room temperature.\nRepeat steps 3.1-3.7.\n\tNOTE: Reduce the coating concentration of the FGFR2 protein to 2.5 μg/mL. Use the second round of amplified phage from section 5 as the input and keep the titer same as in the first round (1011 PFU). Shorten the incubation time of phage and FGFR2-coated dish to 30 min and increase the Tween concentration to 0.5% (v/v) in the wash steps.\n7. Acquisition of plaque DNA for sequencing\nPlaque amplification\n\t\nDilute (1:100) an overnight culture of ER2738 in LB. Dispense 1 mL of diluted culture into a 2 mL tube, one for each clone to be characterized.\nUse a pipette tip to pick one well-separated blue colored plaque from a titer plate from section 6 and transfer to the tube containing the diluted culture. Pick a total of 15 plaques.\n\t\tNOTE: Plates should be < 1–3 days old, stored at 4 °C, and have < 100 plaques.\nIncubate the tubes with vigorous shaking for 4.5 h at 37 °C.\nTransfer the cultures to centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 30 s. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh tube and centrifuge again.",
    "Using a pipette, transfer the upper 80% of the supernatant to a fresh tube. Label this as the amplified phage stock.\n\t\tNOTE: Dilute the amplified phage with an equal volume of 100% sterile glycerol and store at -80 °C for later use.\nExtraction of plaque DNA\n\t\nTransfer 500 µL of the amplified phage to a fresh microfuge tube and add a 1/6 volume of 20% PEG/2.5 M NaCl. Invert to mix and let it stand for 10–20 min at room temperature.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and then pour off the supernatant.\n\t\tNOTE: Phage pellet may not be visible.\nCentrifuge again.

Wash the pellet with 0.5 mL of 70% ethanol, quickly centrifuge again, remove the supernatant, and brieﬂy dry the pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in 30 µL of TE buffer and use this for sequencing.\n\t\tNOTE: Pre-cool the 70% ethanol at -20°C in advance of Step 7.2.6. The phage pellet must be thoroughly resuspended in the iodide buffer prior to the addition of ethanol.\n8. Identification of the peptide sequence\nUse the -96 gIII sequencing primer (5´-CCC TCA TAG TTA GCG TAA CG –3´) for sequencing.\nAnalyze the peptide sequences displayed on the phage based on the DNA sequencing results.\nSynthesize small peptides and analyze by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and mass spectrometry to confirm their purity (≥98%).\n9. Detecting the affinity of the obtained small peptide and extracellular protein of FGFR2 by ITC",
    "Degas sterile water using an ultrasonic instrument. Dissolve the small peptide and the FGFR2 extracellular protein in sterile water. Centrifuge these samples to remove residual precipitate.\nPerform the ITC titration experiments at 25 °C. Titrate 40 μM of small peptide in the cell with 1.5 μM of FGFR2 protein from the syringe, with a stirring speed of 750 rpm. Add the FGFR2 protein in 2 μL aliquots (for a total of 19 injections) at 5-min intervals.\nAnalyze the ITC data using a single-site binding model.\n\tNOTE: Sterile water must be degassed, and all samples must be centrifuged to remove air bubbles and residual impurities.
