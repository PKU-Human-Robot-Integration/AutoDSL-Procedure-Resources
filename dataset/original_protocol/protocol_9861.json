    "All procedures were approved by the George Mason University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and are in accordance with guidelines set forth by the Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care.\n1. Animals and considerations prior to the assessment\nFor this protocol, use adult, 9 - 12-month-old C57BL/6J (n = 10) (stock # 000664) wildtype mice and APOE e4 mice (n = 11) from a hemizygous J20 (stock #006293) x homozygous APOE e4 (stock #012307) cross.\nIn the housing room, group-house mice with littermates of the same sex with appropriate enrichment (e.g., for this protocol, mice were provided a running wheel, igloo, and a small nylon chew toy). Group-house 4 - 6 female mice, and 4 males in a 356 mm L x 485 mm W x 218 mm H home cage.\n\tNOTE: Researchers may consider implementing strategies prior to and/or after nesting in order to avoid cage-mate aggression when mice are reintroduced after nesting trials. Such strategies may include, but are not limited to, daily handling prior to behavioral testing to better acclimate mice to handling during behavioral testing, researchers, and husbandry staff19, separating and individually housing aggressive mice, or reducing the number of mice in the homecage20, depending on the severity of in-cage fighting, observed wounds21, etc.\n2. Room and nesting set-up\nEnsure that each mouse completes four trials (1 material per trial). Randomize the order of nesting material for each mouse to avoid an order effect.\nPrepare the cages in a separate testing room. Record environmental conditions (e.g., 22.2 – 22.3°C, 45-47% humidity, lights on 9:00 AM – 9:00 PM) such that they are consistent across trials and are identical to the housing room. Provide food and water ad libitum.",
    "Assign each mouse a random identification (ID) number or letter. Attach the random identifier card to a 29.2 x 18.4 cm cage.\nRecord the original animal ID/tag and other necessary identification in a colony record to ensure that assistants and animal husbandry staff remain blind to conditions.\nRandomly order cage placement in the testing room such that wildtype and transgenic mice are not inappropriately separated (i.e., on opposite sides of the room, on separate shelves, etc.).\nPrepare the nesting materials by sufficiently covering the bottom of the cage. Use approximately 100 g dry weight of corncob bedding for the square, twist, and shredded paper trials, and approximately 100 g of the soft cob bedding for the soft cob trial.\nIf using a beaker to disperse the nesting material, then fill the beaker no more than 100 mL with corncob bedding or soft cob bedding.\nPlace the first nesting material in the sequence prior to introducing the mouse into the cage. This protocol utilized (1) a single pressed cotton square, (2) a single paper twist, (3) 100g of soft cob bedding only (i.e., no additional bedding or nesting material added), and (4) 2.5 g of clean (no ink), shredded white printer paper cut into 5 – 7cm strips. Disperse nesting materials as shown in Figure 1 (baseline).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60139/60139fig1v3.jpg\nFigure 1: Cage set-up for each material. All mice completed one trial with each type of material for a total of four trials. Corncob bedding lined the entire bottom of the cages containing a paper twist, a pressed cotton square, and shredded paper. Soft cob bedding was evenly dispersed across the cage to encourage mice to separate out the small cotton squares from the corncob.

    "Begin the first nesting trial at the same time of day at the start of the light cycle (e.g., 9:00 AM).\nBring the homecage containing the mice into the testing room. Remove each mouse from the homecage and place it into its assigned nesting cage with the material already placed in the cage. Return the homecages to the housing room.\nAllow mice to complete 1 trial for 24 h undisturbed.\n24 h after the start of the first trial, return to the testing room.\nCarefully remove the lid of the cage and photograph each mouse’s nest, capturing the assigned ID in the photograph and minimizing the appearance of any materials outside of the cage.\n\tNOTE: Wait for the mouse to move off the nest before attempting to remove it from the cage. It is strongly recommended to photograph the nest while the mouse is in the cage but off the nest. Attempting to remove the mouse from the cage before photographing can potentially cause the mouse to become startled, thus move on top of, and disperse, nesting materials.\nGently remove the mouse from the nesting cage and place it in a temporary holding cage. Dispose of the bedding and any nesting materials, replace the bedding and provide the next nesting material in the sequence, and return the mouse to the nesting cage.\nRepeat as necessary to obtain scores for all 4 trials. It is recommended to use shredded paper and the accompanying scoring criteria, although researchers may be interested in using the alternative materials discussed in this protocol.\nWhen all trials are complete, return mice to their home cages. Observe the mice for any potential aggressive behavior. Aggression may occur in older wildtype males.",
    "NOTE: For the purposes of this protocol, mice were tested once at approximately 9 – 12 months of age. Nesting should be conducted at several ages (i.e., at an earlier age, dependent on the chosen strain, prior to the onset of phenotypic traits) to document the decrease in nesting capacity over time and demonstrate the likely causative role of neurodegeneration.\n4. Scoring and assessing inter-rater reliability\nProvide baseline images for each nesting material to at least 2 individuals blind to the study. Although not required, ensure that the scorers are familiar with the concept of nesting. When training scorers, provide a series of example nests (e.g., Figure 2 for shredded paper) to familiarize the scorers with each type of material (if applicable) and the scoring criteria.\n\t\nEvaluate each nest on a scale of 1 – 5 using the following scale information (adapted from Deacon, 2006)2. See Figure 2 as example scoring using shredded paper.\nAssign a score of 1 when the shredded paper or small squares remained scattered throughout the cage, or the cotton square or twist remained untouched;\nAssign a score of 2 when some of the material was constructed into a nest, but over 50% of the material was not used for nest construction (i.e., remained scattered or the majority of the original material remained untouched);\nAssign a score of 3 when a noticeable nest was constructed, but several pieces were still scattered;\nAssign a score of 4 when almost all the material was used for the nest, but few pieces of material remained scattered or were near the nest;\nAssign a score of 5 when all material was used to make an identifiable nest.",
    "NOTE: Scorers should take breaks and revisit baseline photos in order to avoid fatigue and bias during the scoring procedure. Scorers should not discuss scores with one another to avoid bias. Scorers should discuss scores after scoring is complete, or if further discussion is needed to change scores, which can potentially resolve issues with intraclass correlations (ICC). Intraclass correlations will be conducted using the steps listed in section 4.2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60139/60139fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Example of scoring using the criteria for shredded paper, the preferred material. From left to right: 1 – the shredded paper remained untouched; 2 – some of the paper was constructed into a nest but most of the pieces remained scattered; 3 – a noticeable nest was constructed, but several pieces were still scattered; 4 – most pieces were used for the nest, but some pieces were scattered near the nest; 5 – all pieces were used to make the nest. Note that in the photographs, the animal’s assigned number is shown to avoid unblinding. The color of the card is random. Researchers should allow the mouse to remain in the cage in order to avoid startling the mouse, which could potentially disperse the nest.

The script removes headers and subjects variables (i.e., the top row and animal IDs) to conduct the intraclass correlation (ICC). Run the script to conduct a two-way, agreement, averages measures ICC by highlighting the demarcated section of the code and hitting Ctrl+Enter or Command+Enter.",
    "Compare the ICC to existing criteria24,25,26. Typically, ICC values above 0.80 correspond to strong inter-rater reliability, justifying scores to be averaged at a given time point (Supplementary File 2).\nUse the same ICC criteria for intra-rater reliability, which may be of interest for those conducting scoring for the first time.\n\tCAUTION: Scorers should score the same photographed nests within a week of the initial assessment. Proceed with caution with averaging data when ICC is low, as this may skew data or produce null findings. If ICC values are low, then (1) additional training for scorers may be required, (2) scorers may need to discuss their reasoning for nest scores, (3) another independent reviewer may be needed to make a judgment call regarding the scores, or (4) intra-rater reliability may need to be assessed. If intra-rater reliability is poor, then additional training or a different scorer may be required.\n5. Statistical considerations\nConduct statistical analyses, as appropriate. For data that do not violate normality assumptions but use multiple materials for each mouse (i.e., a within-subjects effect), use a mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA).\n\t\nIf using codes provided as supplemental files, please download additional add-on packages which are specified in the script27,28,29,30.\nIf conducting a mixed ANOVA using the provided script, run the script to convert any wide-format data files into long-format (i.e., instead of variables repeated across Columns, convert the cells to repeat across Rows). An example data file is included in this manuscript to demonstrate how to convert a data file from wide-format to long-format.\nConduct the mixed ANOVA, as specified in the script. Note that if Mauchly’s test of Sphericity is violated, then implement correction factors such as Greenhouse-Geisser correction.",
    "Conduct any necessary posthoc tests to examine differences among factors with more than 2 levels, as specified in the coding script. In this example, conduct Bonferroni posthoc tests to compare the different types of nesting material.\n\t\tNOTE: If only using one nesting material, then do not incorporate a within-subjects factor. If collecting data at multiple time points, however, incorporate these repeated-measures as if levels of a within-subjects factor.\n\t\t​NOTE: In some cases, wildtype mice may have perfect scores and thus will exhibit a ceiling effect, leading to a non-normal distribution2. Consider appropriate statistical tests (e.g., nonparametric tests with alternative measures of central tendency and dispersion), normalization methods, or robust approaches (mixed effects modeling for repeated measures) when analyzing data."
