    "Our study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee.\n1. Basic Information\nNOTE: The analytical protocols can be applied to various types of data without any restrictions as to specific participants, electrodes, reference methods, or electrode locations. In our example, we tested six patients suffering from pharmacologically intractable focal epilepsy. We tested patients who had no epileptic foci in the regions of interest.\nRecord intracranial EEG data during the cognitive experiment at the target electrodes.\n\t\nImplant depth electrodes using the stereotactic method12.\nUse subdural platinum electrodes (diameter: 2.3 mm) and depth platinum electrodes (diameter: 0.8 mm) to simultaneously measure cortical and subcortical activity, respectively.\nPlace reference electrodes on the surface of the skull of the midline dorsal frontal region, with the contacts of the electrodes facing away from the skull to avoid referential activation12.\nAmplify data, filter online (band pass: 0.5–300 Hz), and sample at 1,000 Hz.\nTo record and statistically remove artifacts associated with eye movements, additionally record electrooculograms. Select the target electrodes based on theoretical interests. In addition, use individual MRI and computed tomography data to check the electrode locations.\nSample and preprocess trial intracranial EEG data (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The analytical protocols can be applied to various types of data without any restriction to specific data-length or preprocessing methods.\n\t\nHere, sample data during 3,000 ms (pre-stimulus: 1,000 ms; post-stimulus: 2,000 ms) for each trial.\nBecause participants here showed abnormally high amplitude activity in some trials, possibly related to epilepsy, exclude these outlier trials using predefined thresholds (>800 μV and >5 SD). Other preprocessing steps, including visual inspection and independent component analysis, may be required depending on the experimental objectives and conditions.\nConvert the EEG system native format to a MATLAB-based SPM format (cf. SPM12 Manual 12.1 and 12.2).",
    "NOTE: The most EEG data formats can be directly imported into SPM software by selecting Conversion in SPM Batch Editor interface and specifying all required input parameters. Another possible way is to use an example script \"spm_eeg_convert_arbitrary_data.m\" in the man/example_scripts subdirectory of the SPM program directory. This script provides a convenient way to convert an ASCII file or MAT file that can be exported by many EEG system with SPM format.\n2. Time-frequency SPM Analysis\nSet up SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) and use the M/EEG analytical menu13 (Figure 2).\nPerform the time–frequency SPM analysis2 by selecting \"Time-frequency analysis\" in the SPM menu for the preprocessed intracranial EEG data of each trial using continuous wavelet decomposition with Morlet wavelets based on predefined parameters (Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: Wavelet transforms reveal the temporal evolution of spectral components by convolving intracranial EEG data with wavelets of multiple frequencies14.\n\t\nHere, conduct wavelet decomposition using seven-cycle Morlet wavelets for the entire epoch (-1,000–2,000 ms) and frequency range of 4–300 Hz.\nDetermine the mother wavelet and number of cycles based on a previous study15. Note that the number of cycles in the wavelet controls the time–frequency resolutions and is recommended to be greater than 5 to ensure estimation stability13.\nDetermine time and frequency ranges based on the research interest.\nCrop the resultant time–frequency maps automatically by selecting \"Crop\" in the SPM menu to remove edge effects. Here, crop the time–frequency maps into -200–500 ms.\nPerform the data transformation (optional) and baseline correction by selecting \"Time-frequency rescale\" in the SPM menu for the time–frequency maps to visualize the event-related power changes better and improve the normality of the data.\n\tNOTE: Here, the time–frequency maps were log-transformed and baseline (-200–0 ms)-corrected.\nConvert the time–frequency maps into two-dimensional (2D) images by selecting \"Convert2Images\" in the SPM menu.",
    "Smooth using a Gaussian kernel with a predefined full-width half-maximum (FWHM) value to compensate for inter-subject variability and conform to the assumptions of the random field theory used in the statistical inference2,13.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, the time–frequency maps were smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of FWHM of 96 ms in the time domain and 12 Hz in the frequency domain based on a previous study2.\nEnter the 2D images into the general linear model by selecting \"Specify 1st-level\" in the SPM menu.\nEstimate the general linear model by selecting \"Model estimation\" in the SPM menu.\nPerform statistical inferences on the time–frequency SPM{T} data based on the random field theory2 by selecting \"Results\" in the SPM menu. Detect significantly activated time–frequency clusters with predefined thresholds (possibly corrected for multiple comparisons).\n\tNOTE: Here, the extent threshold of p <0.05, which was FWE-corrected for multiple comparisons, with a height threshold of p <0.001 (uncorrected) was used.\n3. DCM of Induced Responses\nSet up SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) and use the M/EEG analytical menu13 (Figure 4).\n\t\nStart DCM analysis by clicking \"DCM\" button in the SPM menu. Activate DCM for induced responses by selecting \"IND\" in the list box. Import the preprocessed intracranial EEG data by clicking \"new data\" in the DCM for M/EEG menu.\nSpecify time window of interest, conditions of interest, contrasts for the selected conditions (this define the modulation inputs later used in network specification), frequency window of interest, and the number of the wavelet cycles in the DCM for M/EEG menu (Figure 5).\n\t\nUse five-cycle Morlet wavelets (4–100 Hz in 1-Hz steps) and set the time window to 1–500 ms.",
    "Determine the wavelet cycle in accordance with the default setting. Note that the software recommendation is the value greater than 5 to ensure estimation stability13. The time–frequency ranges were determined based on our research interest. Note that a time window with an additional ± 512 ms was automatically used during computation to remove edge effects.\nBased on the DCM framework4,5, define the (1) driving inputs, which represent the sensory inputs on neural states; (2) intrinsic connections, which embody the baseline connectivity among neural states and self-connections; and (3) modulatory effects on intrinsic connections via experimental manipulations for null and hypothesized models. Also define the type of modulation as linear (within-frequency) or nonlinear (between-frequency).\n\t\nSpecify intrinsic (linear and nonlinear) connections, driving inputs, and modulation inputs in the DCM for M/EEG menu.\nModify the default settings of some related parameters (e.g., prior stimulus onset time and duration) if necessary. Estimate the models by selecting \"invert DCM\" in the DCM for M/EEG menu. After that select Save results as img to save frequency-frequency modulatory coupling parameter images.\nConduct a random-effects Bayesian model selection (BMS) analysis17 by clicking \"BMS\" in the DCM for M/EEG menu to identify the optimal network model. Use the model expected probabilities and/or exceedance probabilities as evaluation measures.\nMake inferences regarding the cross-frequency patterns of the modulatory connections using the winning model parameters by using the SPM menu (see Step 2).\n\t\nSmooth the modulatory coupling parameter images by selecting \"Convert2Images\" in the SPM menu.\nPerform general linear model analyses by selecting \"Specify 2nd-level\" in the SPM menu.\nCalculate the 2D SPM{T} values by selecting \"Results\" in the SPM menu.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, the FWHM was set at 8 Hz based on a previous study4. Significant values were exploratorily identified using a height threshold of p <0.05 (uncorrected).",
