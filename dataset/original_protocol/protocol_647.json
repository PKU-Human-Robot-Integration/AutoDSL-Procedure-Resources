    "**1) Primary PCR amplification**\nThe first step of this protocol can be carried out using option A or B, depending on whether the user wishes to perform the template concentration optimization step \\(A -recommended for new sample types or unknown samples) or not \\(B - recommended for samples with known and consistent template concentrations).\n**CRITICAL STEP:** In order to minimize the potential for cross-contamination of samples, for all sample transfer steps, ensure that the liquid in the plate has been completely spun down and remove the seals slowly to avoid aerosolization. Likewise, for all sample mixing steps, make sure each individual well of the plate is well sealed.\n**1A.I) Creating sample dilution plate**\n**CRITICAL STEP:** For low abundance samples, sample dilution may result in population bottlenecking. Optimal results are achieved by minimizing PCR cycles and selecting the most concentrated samples possible. Potential bottlenecking can be assessed by sequencing multiple dilutions.\ni) Vortex samples to mix at 1900RPM for 15 seconds and spin-down on centrifuge.\nii) Using the Liquidator or a multichannel pipet, dispense 10 μl of undiluted sample into quadrant 1 \\(A01) of a 384-well deep-well plate that already has 18 μl water dispensed into quadrants 2 \\(A02), 3 \\(B01), and 4 \\(B02). Label plate appropriately.\niii) Make a 10 fold dilution series using one set of 20 μl Liquidator tips, or using a multichannel pipet. Transfer 2 μl of each sample from quadrant 1 \\(A01) to quadrant 2 \\(A02). Mix by pipetting up and down 10x.\n**CRITICAL STEP:** Do not go to the second stop on the Liquidator trigger, as this will introduce bubbles.\niv) Using the same tips, transfer 2 μl of well-mixed sample from quadrant 2 \\(A02) to quadrant 3 \\(B01). Mix samples in quadrant 3 by pipetting up and down 10x.",
    "v) Finally, transfer well-mixed samples from quadrant 3 \\(B01) to quadrant 4 \\(B02) to complete the dilution series.\nvi) Using the same set of tips, change the volume on the Liquidator to 3 μl, and transfer 3 μl of each dilution to a barcoded 384-well PCR plate, starting with the most dilute sample in quadrant 4 \\(B02) and ending with the most concentrated sample in quadrant 1 \\(A01). Label plate appropriately.\nvii) Cover plate with foil seal, vortex to mix and spin-down on centrifuge.\n**PAUSE POINT:** Store plates at -20°C or continue on to primary PCR.\n**1A.II) Primary PCR**\ni) Thaw the KAPA HiFi PCR kit reagents as well as the sample dilution 384-well plate if it has been stored in the freezer. Remember to vortex and centrifuge the plate\\(s) and reagents \\(when thawed) before using them.\nii) Make a 2x KAPA HiFi qPCR master mix using the following recipe \\(see Table 1 for list of marker-gene primer sequences):\n1.2 µl 5x KAPA HiFi buffer\n0.18 µl 10 mM dNTPs\n0.3 µl DMSO\n0.12 µl ROX \\(25 µM)\n0.003 µl 1000x SYBR Green\n0.12 µl KAPA HiFi Polymerase\n0.3 µl forward primer \\(10 µM)\n0.3 µl reverse primer \\(10 µM).\n0.48 µl Nuclease-free water\n**TROUBLESHOOTING:** This recipe uses the KAPA HiFi Polymerase enzyme at 1x the manufacturer’s recommendation. For samples with low template abundance, a lower enzyme concentration such as 0.5x may be desirable, as we have shown that decreasing the enzyme concentration can improve sample balance and reduce adapter dimer contamination.\niii) Using a Matrix or multichannel pipette, dispense 3 μl of 2x KAPA HiFi qPCR master mix in each reaction well on the 384-well plate containing sample for a final reaction volume of 6 μl.",
    "iv) Seal the plate with an optical seal, vortex at 1900 rpm for 15 seconds to mix, and spin-down in centrifuge.\nv) Run the following qPCR protocol on the ABI 7900. Typically, this should be run for 20 cycles and stopped at the end of the final extension phase.\nCycling Conditions:\n95°C – 5 minutes\n15-30 cycles of:\n98°C – 20 seconds\n55°C – 15 seconds\n72°C – 1 minute\nHold at 4°C\n**TROUBLESHOOTING:** Samples that amplify poorly can be amplified with increased cycle numbers. It is recommended that a water blank be run to allow assessment of potential contamination in reagents.\n**PAUSE POINT:** Store plate at -20°C or continue on to analysis and cherry-picking and primary PCR dilution.\n**1A.III) Analysis and cherry-picking and primary PCR dilution**\nThis analysis and cherry-picking protocol has been protocolized on an EpMotion 5075 Robot. Cherry-picking of optimally amplified samples could also be done using other systems or even manually, though using a robot is strongly recommended to avoid error.\ni) Export the “Clipped data” .txt file from the ABI 7900, open it with Microsoft Excel, and paste the contents of this file into the “paste clipped data” tab of the DI_qPCR_Analysis.xlsx template \\(see Supplemental Files).",
    "ii) Examine the amplification curves for each sample in the “96-well summary” tab of the DI_qPCR_Analysis.xlsx spreadsheet. If the samples have amplified consistently, enter the number of amplification cycles and a target Rn value in the “Set thresholds” tab. This target Rn value should be the Rn at which most or all samples have at least one dilution that is in the mid-to-late exponential phase of the PCR at the final amplification cycle. Try to minimize the number of plateaued \\(i.e. overamplified) samples that you are selecting. Such samples can be excluded automatically by entering “TRUE” in the “Exclude overamplified samples?” box on the “Set thresholds” tab.\n**CRITICAL STEP:** Double-check the cherry-picking choices in the “Calculations” tab \\(to make sure that the sub-optimal choices are not being made, for instance, choosing a non-amplified samples when all of the amplified samples have plateaued). If necessary, cherry-picking choices can be manually edited by changing the entry in column “AA” in the “Calculations” tab to select the desired dilution.\niii) Open the “EpMotion program” tab and save the data in this tab as a .csv file.\niv) Centrifuge the 384-well qPCR plate to collect sample and remove the optical seal from the plate.\nv) Using the EpMotion, transfer 2 μl of sample of the appropriate dilution from the 384-well qPCR plate to a 96-well plate containing 18 μl of water, making a 1:10 dilution of the initial PCR. Label this plate appropriately.\nvi) Cover 1:10 dilution plate with foil seal, vortex at 1900 RPM for 30 seconds and spin down in centrifuge.\nvii) Transfer 5 μl of the sample to a 96-well plate containing 45 μl of water to make a 1:100 dilution. Label this plate appropriately.\n**PAUSE POINT:** Store plates at -20°C or continue on to Indexing PCR.\n**1.B.I) Creating sample plate**",
    "i) If desired, normalize samples to a consistent concentration in a 96-well plate. Label plate appropriately.\nii) Transfer 3 ul of sample from each well to a 96-well run plate. Seal the plate with a foil seal. Label plate appropriately.\niii) Vortex samples to mix at 1900RPM for 15 seconds and spin-down in a centrifuge.\n**PAUSE POINT:** Store plates at -20°C or continue on to primary PCR.\n**1.B.II) Primary PCR**\ni) Thaw the KAPA HiFi PCR kit reagents as well as 96-well plate if it has been stored in the freezer. Remember to vortex and centrifuge the plate\\(s) and reagents \\(when thawed) before using them.\nii) Make a 2x KAPA HiFi PCR master mix using the following recipe \\(see Table 1 for list of marker-gene primer sequences):\n1.2 µl 5x KAPA HiFi buffer\n0.18 µl 10 mM dNTPs\n0.3 µl DMSO\n0.12 µl KAPA HiFi Polymerase\n0.3 µl forward primer \\(10 µM)\n0.3 µl reverse primer \\(10 µM).\n0.6 µl Nuclease-free water\n**TROUBLESHOOTING:** This recipe uses the KAPA HiFi Polymerase enzyme at 1x the manufacturer’s recommendation. For samples with low template abundance, a lower enzyme concentration such as 0.5x may be desirable, as we have shown that decreasing the enzyme concentration can improve sample balance and reduce adapter dimer contamination.\niii) Using a Matrix or multichannel pipette, dispense 3 μl of 2x KAPA HiFi PCR master mix in each reaction well on the 96-well plate\\(s) containing sample for a final reaction volume of 6 μl.\niv) Seal the plate\\(s) with Microseal PCR film, vortex at 1900 rpm for 15 seconds to mix, and spin-down in centrifuge.\nv) Run the following PCR protocol on the BioRad Tetrad \\(or equivalent PCR machine). Typically, this should be run for 20 cycles and stopped at the end of the final extension phase.\nCycling Conditions:",
    "95°C – 5 minutes\n15-30 cycles of:\n98°C – 20 seconds\n55°C – 15 seconds\n72°C – 1 minute\nHold at 4°C\n**TROUBLESHOOTING:** Samples that amplify poorly can be amplified with increased cycle numbers. It is recommended that a water blank be run to allow assessment of potential contamination in reagents.\n**PAUSE POINT:** Store plate at -20°C or continue on to Primary PCR dilution.\n**1.B.III) Primary PCR dilution**\ni) Transfer 2 μl of sample of each well of the 96-well Primary PCR plate to a 96-well plate containing 18 μl of water, making a 1:10 dilution of the initial PCR. Label this plate appropriately.\nii) Cover 1:10 dilution plate with foil seal, vortex at 1900 RPM for 30 seconds and spin down in centrifuge.\niii) Transfer 5 μl of the sample to a 96-well plate containing 45 μl of water to make a 1:100 dilution. Label this plate appropriately.\n**PAUSE POINT:** Store plates at -20°C or continue on to Indexing PCR.\n**2.I) Indexing PCR: Picking an indexing scheme**\ni) Determine an i5 and i7 dual-indexing scheme, ensuring no index overlap between samples to be pooled for sequencing \\(see Appendix 1 on making indexing primer plates). The final scheme used will be dependent on how many samples are to be pooled together for sequencing. For low numbers of samples, follow the Illumina’s guidelines for low-plex sample pooling \\(http://www.illumina.com/documents/products/technotes/technote_nextera_low_plex_pooling_guidelines.pdf)\nSee Table 2 and attached MiSeq setup sheets for index primer sequences.\n**CRITICAL STEP:** Be absolutely certain that no two samples have the same index combination.\nii) Copy and paste the sample names, sample plate number, into the appropriate MiSeq setup template \\(see Supplemental Files – MiSeq setup templates). Save this file as a .csv file.\n**2.II) Indexing PCR**",
    "i) Thaw the KAPA HiFi PCR kit reagents as well as the Primary PCR 1:100 dilution plate if it has been stored in the freezer. Remember to vortex and centrifuge the plate\\(s) and reagents \\(when thawed) before using them.\nii) Make sure there is a corresponding 5 μM oligo plate for each index scheme being used \\(see Appendix 1).\niii) Make a 3.33x KAPA HiFi Indexing PCR master mix using the following recipe:\n2 µl 5x KAPA HiFi buffer\n0.3 µl 10 mM dNTPs\n0.5 µl DMSO\n0.2 µl KAPA HiFi Polymerase\niv) With a multichannel pipette, dispense 3ul of mix into each well of a 96-well PCR plate. Label this plate appropriately.\nv) Using the Liquidator, or a multichannel pipet, pull 5 μl from the Primary PCR 1:100 dilution plate and dispense into the corresponding 96-well PCR plate that already contains 3 μl of the Indexing PCR master mix.\nvi) Using the Liquidator, or a multichannel pipet, pull 2 μl from the appropriate 5 μM indexing scheme plate and dispense into the corresponding 96-well PCR plate that contains the indexing PCR master mix and sample.\nvii) Optional – If you are preparing more than 96 samples, with the tips still submerged in the sample, change the Liquidator volume knob to 10\nμl and draw up the 10 μl reaction dispense \\(starting in quadrant 1, A01) into a 384-well plate. Label this plate appropriately.\nviii) Repeat steps iii-vii using a new set of Liquidator tips if there is more than one plate to set up.\nix) Cover the PCR plate\\(s) with Microseal PCR film, vortex at 1900 RPM\nfor 30 seconds and spin down in a centrifuge.\nx) Amplify PCR plate\\(s) for 10 cycles on the BioRad Tetrad \\(or comparable PCR machine) using the following cycling conditions:",
    "95°C – 5 minutes\n10 cycles of:\n98°C – 20 seconds\n55°C – 15 seconds\n72°C – 1 minute\nHold at 4°C\nxi) After the PCR program is complete, centrifuge the plate to collect the sample.\n**PAUSE POINT:** Store plates at -20°C or continue on to Normalization and Pooling.\n**3) Normalization and pooling**\nThe normalization and pooling step of this protocol can be carried out using option A or B, depending on availability of equipment and reagents, whether or not size selection is required, and scale \\(A - PicoGreen-based normalization - recommended for smaller-scale projects or when doing size selection; B - SequalPrep–based normalization - recommended for larger-scale projects).\n**TROUBLESHOOTING:** Note that the presence of adapter dimers can throw off mass-based normalization calculations and may lead to sample pool imbalance if different samples have different amounts of adapter dimer contamination \\(particularly if libraries are size selected).\n**3.A.I) PicoGreen quantification of indexed samples**\ni) Determine the individual sample concentrations by PicoGreen \\(following manufacturer’s protocol).\n**3.A.II) Normalization calculations**\ni) Determine a desired concentration for normalization. This concentration can be adjusted depending on how concentrated or dilute the samples are.\nii) For each sample, calculate the amount of water that needs to be added to a fixed volume of indexing PCR sample \\(typically 2 μl, 4 μl, or 6 μl) in order to get the desired concentration.\n**3.A.III) Sample Normalization**\ni) Use the EpMotion to transfer the appropriate amount of water to each well of a new 96-well plate. Label this plate appropriately.\nii) Use the Liquidator or a multichannel pipette to add the previously determined fixed amount of indexing PCR sample to each well on the normalization plate.\niii) Cover plate with foil, vortex to mix and spin-down in the centrifuge.",
    "**TROUBLESHOOTING:** We have observed some systematic differences in the efficiency of amplification and ultimate sample balance associated with specific indexing primers. At this point it is unknown whether this is due to intrinsic sequence-specific properties of the indexing primers or due to the specific synthesis. However, whatever the cause, we have found that sample balance can be improved by adding empirically determined index-specific correction factors to the normalization calculations.\n**PAUSE POINT:** Store plates at -20°C or continue on to Pooling and clean-up.\n**3.A.IV) Pooling and clean-up**\ni) Dispense an equal volume of each sample to be pooled into a trough. Mix well and transfer from the trough to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube.\n**CRITICAL STEP:** If doing the optional size selection step, make sure not to pool more than 1 μg \\(Which is the maximum input for the Caliper cut). The amount of each sample to pool depends on the number of samples and the normalized sample concentration.\nii) Use the Speedvac to concentrate the sample pool down to 20-100 μl and purify the sample pool using 1X AmPureXP beads \\(Appendix 2). If you will be size selecting the material on the Caliper XT, elute in 12.5 μl of nuclease-free water. If the sample will not be size selected, or if you have pooled >1.5 μg of sample, elute in 25 μl of nuclease-free water or EB \\(10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0).\n**PAUSE POINT:** Store samples at -20°C or continue to Library QC or optionally size selection using the Caliper XT.\n**3.B.I) SequalPrep plate-based normalization**\ni) Purify the 10 μl indexing PCR reactions using a SequalPrep normalization plate, following the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "**CRITICAL STEP:** For new sample types, make sure that there is sufficient input material post-indexing PCR to use the SequalPrep plates. This can be assessed using the PicoGreen assay. If samples are expected to be consistently amplified, it may suffice to spot-check several samples.\n**3.B.II) Pooling and clean-up**\ni) Dispense 10 μl of each sample to be pooled into a trough. Mix well and transfer from the trough to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube. For projects with large numbers of samples, the volume of pooled material can be adjusted downward.\n**TROUBLESHOOTING:** We have typically observed yields that are ~5-10 fold lower than those listed in the SequalPrep manual. Keep this in mind when pooling to ensure that you have enough material in the final library to sequence. The eluted material, which is typically in the range of 0.1-0.2 ng/ul, will need to be concentrated 5-10x in order to get the library into the 1-2 nM range required for Illumina sequencing.\nii) Use the Speedvac to concentrate the sample pool down to 20-100 μl and purify the sample pool using 1X AmPureXP beads \\(Appendix 2). Elute in 25 μl of nuclease-free water or EB \\(10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0).\n**PAUSE POINT:** Store samples at -20°C or continue to Library QC.\n**OPTIONAL: Size selection using the Caliper XT**\ni) Remove the Caliper LabChip XT DNA 750 kit reagents from the 4°C and the AmPureXP beads and let them come to room temperature. The Caliper reagents are light sensitive- so keep them in the dark.\nii) Load 10 μl of the concentrated pool on a single Caliper LabChip DNA 750 chip lane and cut depending on the region being amplified, following the manufacturer’s protocol. The sizes used for size selecting different variable regions are as follows:",

Load the sample sheet on the MiSeq.\niii) Follow Illumina’s protocol for preparing the instrument and flow cell.",
    "iv) In a 1.5 ml microfuge tube, denature 10 μl of 2 nM library by incubating with freshly diluted 0.2 N NaOH for 5 minutes at room temperature.\nv) Add 980 μl of Illumina’s HT1 buffer to bring the sample to 20 pM.\nvi) Dilute to 8 pM by mixing 400 μl of 20 pM library and 600 μl of Illumina’s HT1 buffer in a clean 1.5 ml microfuge tube.\nvii) Prepare 8 pM PhiX.\nviii) Remove 150 μl of the 8 pM library and discard. Add 150 μl of 8 pM PhiX to the remaining 850 μl of 8 pM library \\(15% PhiX spike).\nix) Add 600 μl of the 8 pM \\(15% PhiX) library to the sample well of the MiSeq cartridge and initiate sequencing. Libraries generated with this protocol are sequenced using standard Illumina sequencing primers \\(which are already present in the MiSeq reagent cartridge).\n**TROUBLESHOOTING:** Sequence quality will be dramatically affected by cluster density and amount of PhiX spike. Accurate clustering will depend on the accuracy of library quantification. The amount of library clustered and may need to be varied to account for differences in library quantification methodology or technique between groups. In addition, for longer amplicons such as V1-V3, V3-V5, and V4-V6, it is desirable to spike in 25% PhiX, rather than 15% \\(see Anticipated Results section).\n \n**APPENDIX 1 – Making 5 μM indexing scheme primer plates**\n**CRITICAL STEP:** In order to avoid potential contamination, we recommend making up batches of indexing scheme plates designed to be used a small number of times \\(≤5).\n**1) Making a 5 μM master plate**",
    "i) Starting with the 100 μM stock plates \\(see Table 2 for primer sequences and plate layouts), first make 10 μM daughter plates containing the desired forward and reverse indexing schemes. Note: forward indexing primers are arrayed in columns \\(and given numerical prefixes as names) and reverse indexing primers are arrayed in rows \\(and given letter prefixes as names).\nii) In a deep-well 96-well plate, for the forward indexing scheme, add 270 μl of nuclease-free water to each well of the column\\(s) corresponding to the indices that you will be using in the 100 μM stock plate. Next transfer 30 μl of each forward index to the column\\(s) containing water.\niii) In a deep-well 96-well plate, for the reverse indexing scheme, add 180 μl of nuclease-free water to each well of the row\\(s) corresponding to the indices that you will be using in the 100 μM stock plate. Next transfer 20 μl of each forward index to the row\\(s) containing water.\niv) Using a multichannel pipet, add 20 ul of the 10 μM forward primers column-wise to a new 96-well plate. Label the plate appropriately \\(i.e. Indexing scheme 1B \\(5 μM)).\nv) Using a multichannel pipet, add 20 ul of the 10 μM reverse primers row-wise to the 96-well plate made in step ii.\nvi) Using a multichannel pipet or the liquidator, Add 40 μl of water to each well create a 5 μM master plate containing 80 μl of indexing primer mix.\nvii) Seal the plate with a foil seal, vortex at 1900 rpm for 15 seconds to mix, and spin-down in centrifuge.\nviii) Repeat for additional indexing schemes if desired\n**PAUSE POINT:** Store master plates at -20°C or continue to Aliquoting limited use indexing plates.\n**2) Aliquoting limited use indexing plates**",
    "i) Thaw the indexing scheme master plate\\(s) if it has been stored in the freezer. Remember to vortex and centrifuge the plate\\(s) \\(when thawed) before using them.\nii) Carefully remove the foil seal from the indexing scheme master plate and use the liquidator or a multichannel pipet to dispense 12 μl of primer mix from each well into each of 6 96-well plates. Each plate will have enough primer mix for 5 indexing reactions, thus each batch makes enough material for 5 x 6 x 96 = 2880 samples per indexing scheme.\niii) Store indexing scheme plates at -20°C.\n**APPENDIX 2 – AmPure XP bead purification**\ni) Vortex AmPure XP beads until they are well mixed. Calculate the amount of beads needed to clean-up the samples \\(typically a ratio of 1.8x beads:sample is used, though 1x or even 0.8x beads:sample ratios can be used in cases where it is desirable to remove material that is <200 bp, such as adapter dimers).\nii) Add appropriate volume of well-mixed AmPure XP beads using a multichannel pipette to each well \\(if using a plate-based magnet) or tube \\(if using a tube-based magnet). Allow the sample and beads to incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature.\niii) Place the plate \\(or tubes) on the magnetic stand at room temperature for 2 minutes, until the liquid appears clear. Remove and discard the supernatant, being careful to not disturb the magnetic bead pellet.\niv) With the magnetic plate still on the stand, wash the bead pellet 2X for 30 seconds with 200-500 μl of fresh 80% ethanol, also while not disturbing the pellet. Make sure that 80% ethanol completely covers the beads during the wash.\nv) Remove all traces of the 80% ethanol and let the plate/tubes dry at room temperature for 10 minutes.",
    "vi) Resuspend the beads in designated amount of nuclease free water and pipette gently to mix. Allow beads/sample to incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes.\nvii) Place the plate/tubes back on the magnetic stand at room temperature for 2 minutes, until the liquid appears clear.\nviii) Transfer supernatant \\(containing the eluted DNA) to a new tube or plate."
