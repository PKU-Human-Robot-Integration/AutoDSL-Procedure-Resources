    "Thaw frozen vial of MA-104 cells received from ATCC on dry ice or frozen in liquid nitrogenRemove the frozen vial of MA-104 cells either from dry ice or liquid nitrogen storage.Thaw MA-104 cells in a 37 °C water bath.Keep the lid of the MA-104 cell frozen vial above the surface of the water to lessen the chances of contamination.When the MA-104 cells are almost thawed (only a small piece of ice) move the vial to the tissue culture hood.Wipe the surface of the vial with 70% ethanol and remove the top.Carefully remove the MA-104 cell suspension using a sterile Pasteur pipette.Gently add MA-104 cells in T75 flask containing 15 ml of pre-warmed MA-104 media at 37 °CPlace the MA-104 cells in T75 flasks in a 5% CO2 incubator.After 24 h discard the old media.Add 15 ml of MA-104 media in T-75 flask and place the flask in a 5% CO2 incubator.MA-104 cell sub culturing when confluent (Figure 1) at ratios 1:3 to 1:10Remove and discard culture media.Rinse the MA-104 cell monolayer with 10 ml 1× DPBS.To remove traces of serum that contains trypsin inhibitor, briefly rinse the cell monolayer with a 0.25% (w/v) Trypsin-0.53 mM EDTA solution.Add 3.0 ml Trypsin-EDTA to the flask and keep the flask in 5% CO2 incubator and observe every 2 min under an inverted microscope until cell monolayeris completely dispersed (typically takes 5-15 min).Add 8.0 ml MA-104 media and break cells by gently pipetting up and downAdd approximately 1 ml aliquot of the cell suspension to new T-150 flaskIncubate culture in an 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °Cimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3955/bioprotoc-11-06-3955-g001.jpgFigure 1.",
    "MA-104 cells at 100% confluency and ready to be subcultured into new flasks Subculture and plating ratios used to prepare MA-104 cells: To achieve 80% confluency of MA-104 cells 2 days after splitting a ratio of 1:3 is used.To achieve 80% confluency of MA-104 cells 4-5 days after splitting a ratio of 1:10 is used.To culture MA-104 cells in 6-well culture dishes, seed at 1 × 106 cells/well.To culture MA-104 cells in 96-well culture dishes, seed at 1 × 104 cells/well.Procedure to freeze MA-104 cellsBefore freezing MA-104 cells check for bacterial, yeast, or fungal contamination under inverted microscope.Freeze only healthy cells in the log phase of growth (between 70-90% confluency; Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3955/bioprotoc-11-06-3955-g002.jpgFigure 2. MA-104 cells shown growing in active log phase ready to be prepared for frozen stocks Split MA-104 cells: Discard old growth media. Wash cell monolayer with 10 ml 1× DPBS then discard 1× DPBS. Rinse cells with trypsin/EDTA and discard it and then add 3 ml of trypsin/EDTA. Once cells start detaching, give the flask a gentle pat and re-suspend the cells with 8 ml of growth media. Disperse cells by gently pipetting up and down to break clumps and get a homogeneous suspension.Count the cells using hemacytometer under inverted microscope.Number of cells used to freeze should be in the range of 5 × 106-1 × 107 cells/vial. Calculate the volume of freezing media needed for a final cell concentration to be in this range.Transfer cell suspension to sterile centrifuge tubes, balance the centrifuge, and centrifuge at 201 × g (1,000 rpm) for 5 min.Carefully remove as much supernatant as possible without disturbing the pelletQuickly re-suspend pellet by adding the calculated amount of recovery freezing medium (Thermo Fisher, catalog number:  12648-010  ) in a 2 ml screw cap tube, and label the tube.",
    "Place the vials in Mr. Frosty Freezing Container, which allows the cells to cool down slowly.Close the freezing container and place at -70 °C for at least overnight.Next day, transfer the vials of frozen MA-104 to liquid nitrogen.ASFV titration in MA-104 cells detection by Hemadsorption (HA)For titration in 96-well culture plates use 1 × 104 cells/well prepared in MA-104 media; recommended volume of cell suspension/well is 100 µl.Prepare ten-fold serial dilutions of each ASFV sample (swine blood) using MA-104 media.Add 50 µl of each dilution of ASFV samples in order from 10-7 to 10-1 to the plate wells containing 100 µl of MA-104 cells.Incubate cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2.24 h post infection (hpi), add 1 µl of 25% v/v suspension of swine red blood cells to each well of MA-104 cells in the plate.Incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for seven days of incubation.Observe the plates under the inverted microscope for Hemadsorption to confirm the infection.Calculate virus titer using the Reed and Muench method (Reed and Muench, 1938) by Hemadsorping dose (HAD) and express it as log10HAD50/ml.Detection of ASFV infection in MA-104 by HAFor HA, plate 2 ml of MA-104 cell suspension prepared in MA-104 media at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well tissue culture dishes.Add ASFV field sample to three wells of the 6-well plate with 1 µl, 10 µl and 100 µl.1 hpi, add 100 µl of 25% v/v suspension of swine red blood cells were to each well.24 hpi, observe ASFV-infected cells for rosette formation in MA-104 cells (Figure 3). Depending on quantity and quality of the ASF sample, rosettes may take longer to form, if no rosettes are observed at 24 hpi, check daily for 7 days.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3955/bioprotoc-11-06-3955-g003.jpgFigure 3.",
