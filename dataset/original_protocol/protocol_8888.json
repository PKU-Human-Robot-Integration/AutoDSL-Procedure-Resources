    "1. Fly Preparation\nOutcross all mutants, Gal4/UAS and other lines with a wildtype strain, such as CSw-, for at least six generations prior to the behavioral experiments to control for genetic background26.\nGrow flies on a standard cornmeal, yeast and molasses food diet under a 12:12 hr light-dark cycle at 25 °C unless specific manipulations require a different temperature.\n\t\nTo determine the effects of transgene expression: Use 18 °C to prevent the expression of transgenes in Gal4 Gal80ts (TARGET system) through development and then move the flies to a 30 °C incubator 1-2 days before the behavioral experiment. Conduct the experiment at 30 °C to determine the effects of transgene expression3,4,6,7,14.\nFor experiments using heat-activated TRPA1 channels to stimulate neurons: Raise the flies at 23 °C, which is a temperature known to maintain an inactive channel, and then shift to a behavior room at 30 °C to activate the TRPA1 expressing neurons.\nFor experiments using Shibiretemperature sensitive to block synaptic output11,14,24: Rear the flies at 18 °C and conduct testing at 30 °C.\nCollect the flies 1-2 days before the experiment and count them in groups of approximately 25 under light CO2 anesthesia. Store the flies at least O/N in food vials (without yeast) at 25 °C (unless specific manipulations required a different temperature) and 70% relative humidity in an environmentally controlled room with 12:12 hr light:dark conditions until the time of the experiment.\n\tNote: This storage allows the flies to acclimatize to the subsequent learning test performed in the environmentally controlled room, which had the optimal conditions for Drosophila learning and, importantly, removes any daily environmental variations that might have affected the behavioral phenotype.\n2. Preparation Before the Experiment\nPerform the experiments in a custom-made Perspex T-maze (Figure 1).",
    "Regularly check the tube fitting to ensure that an airtight seal is obtained during the experiment. If necessary, change the O-rings that seal the inside compartments of the T-maze.\nPlace custom-made copper grids inside the training tubes. Check and clean these grids regularly, and replace if oxidized. Attach the copper grids to wires via crocodile clips that run to a switch-box connected to an electric stimulator. Use a voltmeter to ensure that the apparatus is delivering the required shock.\nUse g-clamps to hold the maze tightly to avoid any air leakage.\nAttach the T-maze to tubing that runs to an air pump, to allow odors to be drawn across the flies and subsequently removed from the T-maze. Maintain mild airflow at ~2 L/min\n3. Odor Dilutions\nUse two different odors at concentrations such that the flies show an equal preference for both odors. Use 4-methylcyclohexanol (1:67) and 3-octanol (1:100) diluted in mineral oil7,13.\n\tNote: Carefully determine these concentrations, which will vary by laboratory. For instance others use 1:10 for both odors24 . Other commonly used odors include ethyl acetate and iso-amyl acetate.\nPipette 30 μl of the diluted odor into a custom-made odor cup placed in an odor block covered by a plastic tube with a perforated top that allows air to be drawn over the odor in the cup, thus exposing the flies to an odor plume.\n4. Training Protocol (Figures 1 and 2)\nFor adult olfactory shock conditioning, perform all experiments under a dim red light (i.e., red LED), which allows the researcher to see but prevents the fly from seeing, thus allowing the flies to concentrate on olfaction as opposed to visual inputs.",
    "Introduce the flies into the training tube and then attach to the T-maze and allow them to adapt to the tube and airflow for 90 sec.\nPresent the first odor (4-methylcyclohexanol, MCH) with a 60-V shock (consisting of twelve 1.25 sec pulses with 3.75 sec inter-pulse intervals) for a total duration of 60 sec.\nFollow the shock with a 30 sec rest period without an odor or shock.\nPresent the second odor (3-octanol, OCT) for 60 sec without a shock.\nFollow the shock with a 30 sec rest period without an odor or shock.\nMove the flies from the training chamber into the central chamber of the T-maze by turning the T-maze on its side and gently banging the bottom of the T-maze on a soft surface such as an old mouse mat. Maintain the flies in the central chamber for 90 sec.\nFit the choice tubes into the bottom of the apparatus to form the T-maze.\nTo measure learning, move the flies to the choice point of the T-maze, where they were simultaneously exposed to both odors and move towards one. Conduct a test period for 120 sec.\nTrap the flies in the choice tubes by sliding the central chamber up thereby blocking the ends of the choice tubes. Collect the flies in each arm of the T-maze and in the central compartment into food vials and count.\nTo measure memory, collect the flies after training (4.6) and transfer them from the T-maze to food vials without yeast. Store flies in the dark at 25 °C and 70% humidity for the remaining time necessary to determine the memory phase of interest (see introduction). Reintroduce the flies to the T-maze as in stage 4.7.",
    "For long-term memory, use a custom built maze which allows several batches of flies to be trained simultaneously. Administer 5 cycles of training with a 15 min inter-cycle interval (spaced) or without an inter-cycle interval (massed). Maintain the flies at 18 °C and 70% humidity in the dark until testing. Prior to testing, move the flies to 25 °C and allow them to acclimatize for at least 1 hr. Assess long-term memory 24 hr after training.\nAfter the behavioral experiments, clean the odor cups with hot water and odorless detergent. After drying, coat the cups with 10 μl sigmacote. Dry the sigmacote by heating in a microwave oven. Occasionally clean the T-maze perspex tubes and odor blocks with hot water and odorless detergent.\n5. Calculation of the Performance Index: a Measure of the Flies’ Memory\nCalculate the Performance Index (PI) for each condition as the number of flies avoiding the shock-paired odor (CS-) minus the number of flies choosing the shock-paired odor (CS+) divided by the total number of flies (CS- + CS+)1.\n\tPerformance index (PI) = (# CS- flies - # CS+ flies) / (# total flies)\nCalculate the final PI of the experiment by averaging the PI of the experiment in which MCH was the shock-paired odor and one in which OCT was the shock-paired odor. This removes any bias of the flies having a higher preference for one odor.\n6. Sensorimotor Controls\nPerform odor acuity by introducing ~40-50 flies into the T-maze6,7,17.\nAfter 90 sec, move the flies to the choice point, and allow them 2 min to choose between pure odors and air.\nCollect and count the flies. Calculate the avoidance percentage by dividing the total number of flies that chose the odor by those that participated in the test.",
    "For shock reactivity6,7,17, introduce the flies into the shock chamber.\nAfter 90 sec of rest, administer a 60-V DC electric shock, from which the flies can escape to a similar tube without a shock.\nAllow 2 min for the flies to choose; collect and count the flies. Calculate the shock avoidance percentage by dividing the number of flies that avoided the shock by escaping the shock tube by the total number of flies in the experiment. Include the flies that remain in the central chamber in the total of those that escaped the electric shock."
