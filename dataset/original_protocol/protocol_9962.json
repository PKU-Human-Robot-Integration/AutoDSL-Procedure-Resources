    "NOTE: All methods described here were approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee (MO12M354).\n1. Preparation of rapamycin in PLLA-PCL\nPrepare two glass vials (with caps) of 70:30 PLLA-PCL polymer solutions (inherent viscosity 1.3−1.8 DL/G; Table of Materials) solutions, with one vial containing 1.0% rapamycin and the other without rapamycin.\n\t\nMake a 1.0% rapamycin containing polymer solution by adding 6 mg of rapamycin to 600 mg of 70:30 PLLA-PCL in a glass vial.\nFor polymer solution without rapamycin (control), only add 600 mg of 70:30 PLLA-PCL to the glass vial.\nUnder a fume hood, add 6 mL of dichloromethane to each glass vial.\n\tCAUTION: Dichloromethane is a corrosive material and only glass pipettes should be used. Appropriate safety precautions include personal eye protection and gloves.\nAdd 120 µL of glycerol to each glass vial (for 2% glycerol solution).\n\tNOTE: The addition of glycerol allows for increased flexibility and decreased stiffness in the stent construct.\nRecap the glass vials and allow 70:30 PLLA-PCL with and without rapamycin to dissolve and homogenize for 6−12 h.\n\tNOTE: Glass vials can also be placed on a rotating shaking platform for faster dissolution.\n2. Rapamycin elution testing\nPipette 1 mL of 70:30 PLLA-PCL solution containing 1% rapamycin into a glass Petri dish.\n\tNOTE: This volume of 70:30 PLLA-PCL solution containing 1% rapamycin will contain 120 µg of rapamycin and represents the total amount of rapamycin in each construct. Alternative volumes and concentrations can be used.\nAllow 70:30 PLLA-PCL with 1% rapamycin to harden into a flat disk in the glass Petri dish.\nOnce hardened, place the disk in 2 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) and incubate in a 37 °C chamber.",
    "Collect and replace PBS (2 mL) every 24 h and use collected PBS for high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of rapamycin content.\nUse an autosampler and a C18 4.6 cm x 250 mm HPLC column to run samples through the autosampler injector along with serial dilutions of rapamycin to create a calibrated standard curve. Run each sample in triplicate.\n\tNOTE: Serial dilutions of rapamycin to be tested include 10%, 1%, 0.1%, and 0.01%.\nUse a mobile phase of HPLC grade water and acetonitrile with 10/90 volume/volume with a flow rate of 2.0 mL/min. Set absorbance during HPLC for rapamycin to 280 nm.\n\tNOTE: Figure 1 shows the elution of rapamycin over a 14 day period.\n3. Creation of rapamycin-eluting PLLA-PCL murine airway stents\nNOTE: Perform steps 3.2−3.9 using sterile materials and sterile technique to avoid contamination that would influence in vivo and in vitro applications.\nPrepare PLLA-PCL solutions containing rapamycin as described in section 1.\nUsing a glass Pasteur pipette with a rubber balloon, apply 1 mL of PLLA-PCL solution containing 1% rapamycin onto the venous cannula of a 22 G fluorinated ethylene propylene based angiocatheter (Table of Materials). Hold the angiocatheter in one hand and use the glass pipette to drop the PLLA-PCL solution onto the angiocatheter. Slowly rotate the angiocatheter to ensure a homogenous coverage of the angiocatheter with the PLLA-PCL solution.\n\tNOTE: At first, the PLLA-PCL solution will be thin, but as the dichloromethane evaporates during the application onto the angiocatheter, the solution will become more viscous to mold onto the angiocatheter. Continuously turning the angiocatheter during the application is beneficial. This step must be done slowly and meticulously to ensure the consistent thickness of the stent.",
    "Prop the molded angiocatheter with the tip of the angiocatheter facing downward and the hilt on the edge of a glass Petri dish for drying.\nAllow stents to dry for 24 h in a vacuum hood at room temperature (Figure 2A).\nRemove the stent construct from the underlying angiocatheter by gently twisting the underlying catheter free and sliding it out of the molded stent (Figure 2B).\nCheck the stent circumferentially for any defects that may have resulted during the casting process. If a defect in the casted stent is present, discard it.\nTrim each end of the casted stent with fine straight scissors so that the edges are axial.\nUsing fine straight scissors, cut 3 mm axial segments of the cast stent for use in a mouse model of LTS (Figure 2C).\n\tNOTE: Approximately 8 stents can be made from one casted angiocatheter, with each 3 mm stent containing 120 µg of rapamycin.\nLoad the 3 mm stent onto a new 22 venous catheter for use in a mouse model of LTS (Figure 1).\n4. Laryngotracheal stenosis induction in mice\nPrior to conducting in vivo mouse studies obtain approval from the Animal Care and Use Committee.\nAnesthetize a 9-week old male C57BL/6 by giving an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (80−100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5−10 mg/kg).\n\tNOTE: Other strains of mice can be substituted, but it is recommended that the mice weight be between 20−27 g.\nRandomize mice into an experimental group (chemomechanical injury with a placement of a 1% rapamycin-containing PLLA-PCL stent) and two control groups: 1) chemomechanical injury with the placement of a PLLA-PCL stent, 2) chemomechanical injury without the placement of a stent.",
    "Place a mouse on a surgical platform in a supine position. Use a small loop of thread affixed to the top of the platform to extend the cervical spine by looping it around the central incisors.\nAffix the hands and legs of the mouse to the table using 2 inch pieces of tape. Pinch mouse paw to ensure it has had adequate anesthesia.\nThe surgical site is then prepped. The overlying fur should be removed and the skin should be cleaned (alternating iodine or chlorhexidine scrub with alcohol or diluted skin disinfectant) three times. The area should be draped and sterile gloves be worn. The sterilized instruments should be laid on a sterile surface when not in use.\nMake a 1.5 cm midline vertical incision in the neck of the mouse using fine curved iris scissors. Divide the overlying thymus and lateralize the two resulting lobes to visualize the trachea. Divide the overlying sternohyoid and sternothyroid (strap) muscles at the superior attachment bilaterally.\n\tNOTE: The entire laryngotracheal complex should be completely exposed after this.\nPass a 22 G angiocatheter transorally through the larynx into the trachea. Use small forceps to apply pressure to the anterior larynx of the mouse to assist in the correct placement of the angiocatheter. Visualize the white angiocatheter through the trachea to ensure correct placement (non-esophageal).\n\tNOTE: The mouse trachea is extremely thin and the white angiocatheter will be visualized through the translucent trachea.\nPass a bleomycin-coated wire brush through the inserted angiocatheter.\nSlowly withdraw the angiocatheter so that only the wire brush remains in the trachea.\nApply counter pressure using fine forceps on the trachea to mechanically disrupt the tracheal lumen with the wire brush.\nReinsert the angiocatheter into the trachea over the wire brush.\nRemove the wire brush and reapply bleomycin.",
    "Repeat steps 4.8−4.12 a total of 5x. Apply bleomycin to the brush between each application.\n\tNOTE: Validation and description of this model can be found in Hillel et al.8.\nRemove the angiocatheter from the mouse trachea.\n\tNOTE: If no stent is to be placed, the incision can be closed with tissue glue.\n5. Transoral PLLA-PCL stent placement in mice\nLoad one 3 mm casted stent onto an empty 22 G angiocatheter (Figure 3A).\n\tNOTE: The stent should rest 5 mm from the tip of the angiocatheter.\nDraw a thin black vertical line on the 3 mm casted stent.\n\tNOTE: This line allows for improved visualization of the stent in the trachea.\nTransorally intubate the mouse with the angiocatheter that has been preloaded with the stent.\nVisualize the stent on the angiocatheter in the trachea through the transcervical incision (Figure 3B).\n\tNOTE: The trachea is very thin, allowing the black dye on the stent to be visualized through the trachea. Use this to confirm correct tracheal placement.\nHold the stent in place by gripping the trachea through the transcervical incision with fine forceps.\nRemove the angiocatheter transorally while maintaining a grip on the stent with the fine forceps.\n\tNOTE: It is extremely important not to apply too much force to the stent to not crush the lumen when the angiocatheter is removed. However, enough force is required to ensure the stent is not removed with the angiocatheter. A 0.8 mm sialendoscope can be used to visualize the location and placement of the stent in the trachea.\nClose the transcervical incision with tissue glue.\nAllow each mouse to recover to its original activity level before placing it back in its cage.\n6. Histologic preparation of samples",
    "Anesthetize mice with inhaled anesthetic and sacrifice mice with cervical dislocation per animal protocol after 7, 14, or 21 days.\n\tNOTE: Based on the chronicity of the study, different time intervals can be used (e.g., 28, 30 days, etc.).\nPosition a mouse on the surgical platform as described in steps 4.4 and 4.5.\nReopen the neck incision on the mouse using fine curved iris scissors.\nExpose the trachea per step 4.6.\nDivide the distal trachea below the level of the stent using fine curved iris scissors.\nDivide the proximal trachea below the larynx and above the stent using fine curved iris scissors.\n\tNOTE: It is important to divide the distal trachea first to prevent the trachea from retracting into the thorax.\nSeparate the divided trachea from the esophagus posteriorly and remove trachea from the mouse.\n\tNOTE: Stents will still be retained within the mouse trachea.\nRemove stent from the trachea and fix in 10% formalin for 24 h.\nEmbed formalin-fixed mouse trachea specimens in paraffin with the distal end oriented superiorly so that axial cuts of the trachea can be made in the next step.\nCut 5 μm sections of the paraffin-embedded mouse trachea using a microtome.\n\tNOTE: Specimens should be cut axially starting from the distal trachea.\nObtain a 5 μm representative section every 250 μm along the length of the specimen.\nComplete H&E stain on each representative section.\n\t\nDeparaffinize the slides by placing in xylene 2x per slide for 3 min.\nPlace the slides in 100% ethanol for 2 min, 95% ethanol for 2 min, and 70% ethanol for 2 min to rehydrate.\nWash the slides with running tap water for 2 min.\nStain the slides in hematoxylin for 3−5 min.\nWash the slides with running tap water for 5 min.",
    "Place the slides in 1% acid alcohol for 1 min.\nWash the slides with running tap water for 1 min.\nRinse in 0.2% ammonia water for 30 s.\nRinse the slides in running tap water for 5 min. Dip in 95% ethanol 10x.\nEosin stain by placing slide in eosin phloxine for 30 s.\nDehydrate the slides by placing in 95% ethanol for 5 min, followed by absolute ethanol 2x for 5 min.\nPlace in xylene 2x for 5 min.\nMount the slides with xylene-based mounting medium.\nMeasure the thickness of the lamina propria as described in Hillel et al.8.\n7. Stent biocompatibility in vivo\nPrepare tissue sections as in steps 6.1−6.4. Do not remove stent from these tracheal sections in order to visualize the changes in inflammation relative to the location of the stent within the lumen of the trachea.\n\t\nTo determine the acute foreign body response to the stent, observe macrophage and T cell activity using CD3 and F4/80 markers.\n\t\tNOTE: Other markers can also be used to determine acute inflammatory reaction to the stent.\nObtain 5 μm cut sections of the paraffin-embedded trachea on commercially available hydrophilic plus slides (Table of Materials). Place two sections on each slide.\n\t\tNOTE: These sections should be from an area of the trachea where the PLLA-PCL stent was placed.\nPlace the slides in xylene 2x for 5 min each.\nPlace the slides in 100% ethanol 2x for 3 min each.\nPlace the slides in 95% ethanol for 1 min.\nPlace the slides in a histology staining rack so that they are immersed in antigen retrieval buffer (Table of Materials) and then place in a vegetable steamer with boiling water for 20 min.\nRemove the staining racks from the steamer and discard the antigen retrieval buffer.",
    "Replace the buffer with 1 mL of PBS.\nPlace the slides in a wet staining box for 1 min.\nDiscard the PBS and incubate the slides with Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS for 30 min.\nDiscard the DMEM and add a mixture of two primary antibodies raised in different species. Cover the slides with paraffin film and incubate overnight at 4 °C in a dark room.\n\tNOTE: In this protocol rabbit anti-CD3 and rat anti-F4/80 (Table of Materials) were used.\nWash the slides in PBS 3x for 5 min.\nIncubate the slides with secondary antibodies specific to the primary antibody species (Table of Materials) diluted in DMEM with 10% FBS for 0.5−1 h at room temperature in the dark.\nWash the slides in PBS 3x for 5 min in the dark.\nMount the slides on coverslips with a drop of mounting medium with 4'6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Store the slides in the dark at either 20 °C or 4 °C.\nObserve the stained slides on a laser scan confocal microscope and photograph.\nQuantify the total number of cells staining with DAPI and antibodies of interest for comparison to uninjured trachea.\n8. Mouse trachea quantitative gene expression analysis\nCollect mouse trachea as described in steps 6.1−6.7 and remove stent.\n\tNOTE: Harvested mouse tracheas can be stored in a -80 °C freezer for up to 2 years.\nDesiccate the tracheal tissue harvested in step 8.1 using fine scissors and further homogenize using a bead mill homogenizer with 1.4 mm ceramic beads (Table of Materials) as part of a commercially available column-based RNA extraction kit (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: Bead mill homogenizer settings = one 40 s cycle at 6 m/s.\nExtract RNA from tracheal lysate using a column-based extraction and purification kit (Table of Materials) following manufacturer's instructions.",
    "Quantify RNA from each sample using a spectrophotometer (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: RNA purity is assessed using the 260/230 nm ratio with a pure RNA sample reading 2.0.\nCreate complementary DNA from extracted RNA using reverse transcriptase (Table of Materials) and a thermocycler with the following settings: 5 min at 25 °C (priming), 46 °C for 30 min (reverse transcription), and then 95 °C for 1 min (inactivation of reverse transcriptase).\nDilute complementary DNA samples with RNase free water to a concentration of 10−25 ng/mL for use in quantitative real-time PCR.\nMix 1 µL of the complementary DNA (10−25 ng/mL) with 10 µL of a PCR mastermix (Table of Materials), 8 µL of ddH2O and 0.5 μL of 10 μM forward and reverse primers for the gene of interest in one well of a 96-well PCR plate (Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: The total volume in each well should be 20 μL. Each well on the 96 well plate should contain only one sample and one gene of interest.\nRepeat steps 8.1–8.7 for all genes of interest and run each sample for each gene in triplicate.\n\tNOTE: The gene-specific forward and reverse primers (Table of Materials) for collagen 1, collagen 3, and the reference gene β-actin are commonly used to investigate markers of fibrosis.\nPlace the 96 well plate on the real-time quantitative PCR machine and initiate the following protocol: denature at 95 °C for 15 s and anneal and extend at 60 °C for 60 s for 40 cycles.",
    "Normalize the cycle threshold value (CT) for gene product detection of each gene of interest (GOI) to the CT value for the reference gene β-actin for all samples to obtain a ΔCT for each GOI. Then, compare the ΔCT values for each GOI for treated and untreated samples to generate a ΔΔCT.\n\tNOTE: The cycle threshold is the point on the amplification curve when a predetermined amount of gene product is present (ΔRn). The ΔRn value for each reaction should be determined for each gene of interest and should fall on the linear portion of the amplification curve.\n\tNOTE: ΔCT = CT (GOI) – CT (reference gene); ΔΔCT = ΔCT (treated) – ΔCT (untreated).\nCalculate the relative change in gene expression between treated and untreated samples as an expression of fold change by calculating 2ΔΔCT.\nSubscription Required.
