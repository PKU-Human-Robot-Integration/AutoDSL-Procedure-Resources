    "This study was approved by The Human Ethics Committee of Ningbo University, China. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects after they were told about the goal, details, requirements, and experimental procedures of the table tennis experimental.\n1. Laboratory preparation for table tennis\nInsert the USB dongle into the PC's parallel port and open the motion-capture infrared cameras and analog-to-digital converter.\n\tNOTE: In this laboratory, the force platform (sampling frequency of 1000 Hz) is used together with the motion acquisition system, and the data collected by the force platform was displayed and preliminarily analyzed through the same system. The default sampling frequency of the force platform is 1000 Hz.\nDouble-click the software icon on the desktop to open the tracking software.\n\tNOTE: Before opening the software, remove all obstacles in the experimental environment and clean the ground.\nEvery camera node will show a green light if the hardware connection is true. When the indicator light of all cameras is green, select eight cameras in the Local System.\nClick on Camera in the Perspective window and adjust the Strobe Intensity as 0.95-1, Gain to times 1 (x1), Threshold as 0.2-0.4, Minimum Circularity Ratio as 0.5, Grayscale Mode to Auto, as well as Max Blob Height to 50.\nPlace the T correction rack in the center of the shooting area, and select eight cameras in the system. Using a 2D model, confirm that the camera can discern T correction and that there are no noise points.\n\t\nPlace the T correction rack in the center of the camera area. Click on the System Preparation, the L - Frame drop-down list, and select 5 Marker Wand & L - Frame. Then, click on the Start button under the AimMX cameras option.",
    "Select the System preparation button, and click on the Start button in the Calibrate MX Camera section in the Tool pane. Then, wave the T-wand in the capture range. When the blue light on the infrared camera stops flashing, stop the action.\n\t\nObserve the progress bar until the calibration process is complete at 100% and returns to 0%. At the same time, observe the error of the image. When the error of the image is less than 0.3, continue the following operation.\nPlace the T-shaped correction frame in the center of the moving area to ensure that the axis direction is consistent with the boundary direction of the force platform.\nSelect the Start button under the Set Volume Origin section in the Tool pane.\n2. Participants' preparation\nNOTE: Sixteen healthy male national level 1 table tennis players volunteered to participate in the experiment (Ages: 20.75 ± 2.06year; Height: 173.25 ± 6.65 cm; Weight: 66.50 ± 14.27 kg; Training Year: 12.50 ± 2.08 year). All of them belong to the Ningbo University table tennis team. Before the formal start of the experiment, the details and process of the experiment were briefly explained to the participants again, and the written informed consent of the participant who met the conditions of the experiment were obtained.\nSelect participants that are right-handed, have the right leg as dominant, and are in good physical health, free of any form of lower limb disease or injury in the last 6 months. A total of 16 male participants who met the experimental conditions were included in this experiment. The demographic information of participants is shown in Table 1.\n\tNOTE: Because there are few left-handed racket users, it was easier to find enough right-handed racket users to participate in this experiment.",
    "Ask all participants to fill out a questionnaire related to fitness.\n\tNOTE: Questions include: Have you had a history of table tennis competition? How often do you take part in table tennis training in a week? Have you suffered any lower-limb disorders and injuries in the last 6 months?\nEnsure that all participants wear professional table tennis match shoes as well as identical t-shirts and tight-fitting pants. Have all participants use the same professional table tennis racket.\nGive each participant 5 min to adapt to the experimental environment and 15 min to warm up with light running on the professional treadmill and stretching. Due to the short duration of the experiment, restrict subjects from eating and drinking during the formal experiment in order to keep them in a stable state.\n\tNOTE: Participants first completed a 5 min jog at an adaptive speed on the lab's professional running table, followed by a 5 min stretch of their lower limb muscles. Finally, they practiced table tennis footwork technique for 5 min. After completing the warm-up task, the participants were given 2 min to adjust their state. The formal data collection began.\n3. Static calibration\nClick on the Data Management button on the toolbar.\nClick on the New Database tab on the toolbar, click on the Location, and then import the description of the trial. Select Clinical Template and click on the Create button.\nSelect the name of the database created in the Open Database window. Then, click on the green New Patient Category button, the yellow New Patient button, and the gray New Session button to create experimental information in the newly opened screen.\nClick on Subjects to create a New Subject data set in the Nexus main pane.",
    "Click on the Start button in the Subject Capture section to create a static model. Click on the Stop button when the image frames are at 140-200 to finish the establishment of the static model.\n\t​NOTE: The participants were asked to stand on a force platform during the experiment. They were asked to maintain a stable posture with their hands folded and raised on their chest, looking ahead, and their feet shoulder-width apart.\n4. Dynamic trials\nAs shown in Figure 1, place the table tennis table and ball basket in the experimental environment to ensure that the subjects have enough space to execute two kinds of footwork.\n\tNOTE: The table tennis table and balls are up to the standards of professional events.\nAsk the participant to hold the ready position, When the experimenter gives the start command, ask the coach to serve the table tennis balls to the first and final impact area, respectively.\n\t\nBefore the formal experiment begins, give the participants enough time to get accustomed to this position through practice.\nAsk the participants to start on the left side of the table, about half a meter away from the table. Then, ask them to hit the first and second served ball by forehand with maximum force and return to the ready position after finishing the second stroke task.\nAsk the participants to first use the chasse step footwork to complete 5 successful strokes, and then use the cross-step footwork to complete 5 successful strokes.\nIn the software, click on the Capture button in the pressure platform to start the recording and click on the Stop button to end the recording. Repeat five times for each participant.",
    "​NOTE: If the shot is not within the range of the target area, or if the subject's right foot is not fully on the force platform, the measurement will be re-taken.\n5. Post-processing\nDouble-click on the trial name in the Data Management window. Click on the Reconstruct Pipeline and Labels buttons in the toolbar to display the experiment demonstration.\nIn the Perspective window, move the blue triangle on the time bar to intercept the desired time interval.\nSelect the Dynamic Plug-in Gait that is in the Subject Calibration pane. Click on the Start button to run and export the data.\n6. Statistical analysis\nAnalyze all data using professional statistical software. Run the Shapiro-Wilks tests to check the normal distribution for all variables.\nUse a paired t-test to compare kinetics characteristics of chasse step footwork and cross-step footwork during table tennis stroke.\nSet the significance level at p < 0.05. The results are presented as the mean ± the standard deviation throughout the text unless otherwise stated.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
