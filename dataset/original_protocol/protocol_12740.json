    "Animals were handled according to approved protocols and animal welfare regulations of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.\n1. Isolation and Purification of MPC-derived Exosomes\nSeed 5 x 106 C2C12 cells in a 15 cm cell culture dish with 20 mL complete Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin G and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nPrepare exosome-depleted medium by ultracentrifugation of FBS at 100,000 x g for 18 h at 4 °C using a swinging bucket rotor. Discard the pellet.\nReplace the complete DMEM with exosome-depleted medium when monolayer cells reach 80% confluence in the culture dish.\nUse a transfer pipette to collect the supernatant from the cell culture dish every 48 h for a total of three times. Collect the supernatant in 50 mL centrifuge tubes, and centrifuge at 150 x g for 10 min to remove the remaining cells.\nFilter the supernatant through a 0.22 μm filter to eliminate cell debris. Ultracentrifuge the filtered medium in ultra-clear tubes using the swinging bucket rotor at 100,000 x g for 120 min at 4 °C to precipitate exosomes.\nResuspend the exosome-containing pellet in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and fill the entire ultra-clear tube with PBS. Perform ultracentrifugation of this suspension at 100,000 x g for 120 min at 4 °C to eliminate contaminating proteins.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the exosome pellet in 100 µL PBS. Store at -80 °C for future use.\nFor electron microscopy analysis, place 3 µL of exosomal suspension on a 200 mesh formvar-coated copper electron microscope grid for 5 min at room temperature. Continue with standard uranyl acetate staining23. Examine the semi-dry grid by transmission electron microscopy.\n2. Intramyocardial Exosome Delivery",
    "NOTE: We used six mice in each group.\nAnesthetize DBA/2J-DMDMDX mice (male; age > 10 months; body weight (BW) > 18 g) with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 100 mg/kg BW of ketamine combined with 10 mg/kg BW of xylazine, and confirm the depth of anesthesia by toe pinch.\nFix each mouse in supine position on a surgical platform by using tape to secure each limb and place a 3-0 suture horizontally below the upper teeth to hold the upper jaw in place.\nApply the depilatory cream to the left side of the mouse chest to remove the fur from the skin.\nPerform endotracheal intubation via oral cavity using a 24 G catheter, and ventilate the mouse with room air at a rate of 195 breaths/min using a rodent ventilator (see the Table of Materials).\nDisinfect the skin with 75% alcohol and 10% povidone iodine.\nMake a 10‒15 mm oblique incision from the left sternal edge to the left armpit, cut the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor by a scissor, then make a left thoracotomy through the fourth intercostal space. Gently insert the retractor bands to spread the thoracic cavity to a width of 10 mm. Take care to avoid damage to the left lung.\nUse two straight tweezers to remove the pericardium, pull them apart, and place them behind the retractor tips to expose the heart. Inject MPC-Exo (50 μg in 30 µL PBS) or 30 μL PBS (as a control) intramyocardially into the anterior wall of the left ventricle using a 31 G insulin needle at one site.\nUse 6-0 nylon sutures to close the thoracic cavity, pectoralis muscles and skin in sequence.\nRecover mice. Once rhythmic, spontaneous breathing is present, remove the mice from the ventilator, and extubate. Observe and record the mice condition after surgery.\n3. Echocardiography",
    "NOTE: A single observer blinded to the experimental groups performs echocardiography and data analysis.\nTwo days after PBS/exosome transplantation, anesthetize the mice with 1‒2% isoflurane.\nFix a mouse in supine position using tape, and apply the preheated acoustic gel on the left chest area.\nAssess left ventricular function by echocardiography as previously described16,24.\nObtain the parasternal long axis view of the left ventricle (LV) in two dimensions (B mode), and then rotate the ultrasound probe 90° to obtain a LV short-axis view at papillary muscle level.\nRecord M-mode echocardiographic images and measure left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESD), left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), and left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV).\nNOTE: Fractional shortening (FS%) = [(LVEDD − LVESD) / LVEDD] x 100, and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF%) = [(LVEDV − LVESV) / LVEDV] x 100.\n4. Immunohistochemistry\nTwo days after PBS/exosome transplantation, anesthetize mice (see step 2.1) and cut the sternum open to expose the thoracic cavity. Dissect the inferior vena cava, and perfuse the heart through the left ventricle apex with 3 mL PBS, followed by 3 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, using a butterfly catheter with a 25 G needle attached to a 5 mL syringe.\nEmbed fixed hearts into paraffin, and cut into 5 μm thick sections.\nDeparaffinize slides in xylene and rehydrate in ethanol solutions in following order: 100% xylene (3 min), 100% xylene (3 min), 100% ethanol (1 min), 100% ethanol (1 min), 95% ethanol (1 min), 80% ethanol (1 min), H2O (1 min).\nFix tissue sections with 4% paraformaldehyde for 8 min at room temperature.\nImmerse slides in sodium citrate (0.01 M, pH 6.0) and perform antigen retrieval using an antigen retriever.\nPermeabilize sections for 1 h at room temperature with 1% polyethylene glycol tert-octylphenyl ether in PBS.",
    "Block sections with 5% goat serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature.\nIncubate sections with diluted primary antibody (anti-dystrophin antibody) in PBS (1:100) overnight at 4 °C, then wash three times with PBS for 5 min.\nIncubate sections with diluted secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG) in PBS (1:400) for 45 min at room temperature.\nControl autofluorescence using an autofluorescence quenching kit (see the Table of Materials).\nUse mounting medium containing DAPI (see the Table of Materials) to mount the slides.\nObserve slides under a confocal microscope.\nSubscription Required.
