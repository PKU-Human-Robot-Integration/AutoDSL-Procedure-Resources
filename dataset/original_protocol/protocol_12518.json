    "1. Preparation of CVD graphene\nPrepare graphene etching solution as described below.\n\t\nDissolve 4.6 g ammonium persulfate (APS) in 20 mL of molecular grade water in a 50 mL beaker for a 1 M solution and cover with aluminum foil. Allow APS to completely dissolve while proceeding to step 1.2.\nPrepare a section of CVD graphene for methyl methacrylate (MMA) coating. Carefully cut a square section of CVD graphene. Transfer the square to a coverslip (50 mm x 24 mm) within a clean Petri dish and cover during transport to the spin coater.\n\t​NOTE: An 18 mm x 18 mm square should yield 25-36 graphene-coated grids.\n2. Coating CVD graphene with MMA\nSet the spin coater settings to a 60 s high speed spin at 2,500 rpm. Carefully place the CVD graphene on the appropriately sized chuck.\n\t​NOTE: Ideally, the CVD graphene will extend 1-2 mm over the edge of the selected chuck to prevent aspiration of MMA into the vacuum system.\nPress the Take/Absorb button to engage the vacuum pump and affix the CVD graphene to the chuck. Apply MMA to the center of CVD graphene square, close lid, and press Start/Stop button immediately. For an 18 mm x 18 mm square of CVD graphene, 40 µL of MMA is sufficient.\nOnce spinning has stopped, disengage the vacuum pump and carefully retrieve the MMA coated CVD graphene with tweezers. Invert the CVD graphene such that the MMA coated side is facing down and place it back on the glass coverslip.\n3. Plasma etching of the graphene back-side\nTransfer CVD graphene on the coverslip into the glow discharger and glow discharge for 30 s at 25 mA using flat-tip tweezers.",
    "Return the CVD graphene on the coverslip to the Petri dish and cover during transport to the copper etching area. MMA coating will protect the topside graphene layer from plasma etching.\n4. Cutting grid-sized MMA coated CVD graphene squares\nUse two pairs of tweezers to support the CVD graphene square. Take note of the orientation of the CVD graphene square, keep the MMA side up while attached to the tweezers (CRITICAL).\nCut CVD graphene into approximately 3 mm x 3 mm squares. Use two sets of reverse-action forceps for this step to hold the CVD graphene square right-side-up and anchor it in position, and also to hold the edge of a 3 mm x 3 mm square after cutting it away from the rest of the square.\n5. Dissolving copper substrate from MMA coated CVD graphene\nCarefully float each 3 mm x 3 mm square in the APS solution. Make contact with the surface of the APS solution prior to releasing each square. Tilt the beaker such that each square can be placed in the solution at a shallow angle; this ensures that the square does not sink.\nCover beaker with aluminum foil and incubate overnight at 25 °C.\n6. Removing MMA/graphene films from APS\nUse a glass coverslip with dimensions 12 mm x 50 mm and extract the MMA/graphene squares from APS by gently plunging the coverslip vertically into the APS and then moving the coverslip laterally such that it abuts a floating MMA/graphene square.\nCarefully remove the coverslip and ensure that the square adheres completely to the side of the coverslip upon removal.",
    "Transfer MMA/graphene squares to a clean 50 mL beaker filled with molecular grade water for 20 min. Gently plunge the coverslip with an MMA/graphene square attached into the water vertically and ensure that the square dislodges from the coverslip upon interaction with the surface of the water. Repeat for all MMA/graphene squares.\n7. Adhering graphene to grids\nUsing negative action tweezers, gently dip a grid vertically into the water with the carbon side facing a floating MMA/graphene square. Once in contact with the square, carefully remove the grid and ensure that the square adheres completely to the carbon side of the grid upon removal. Minimize lateral movement of the grid when submerged in water to prevent damaging grid squares (CRITICAL).\nPlace grids on a clean coverslip MMA/graphene side up and air dry for 1 to 2 min. Transfer coverslip graphene/MMA coated grids to a hot plate set to 130 °C using flat-tip tweezers.\nCover with the top of a glass Petri dish and incubate for 20 min. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature for 1 to 2 min.\n\t​CAUTION: Exercise caution as the Petri dish top will be extremely hot.\n8. Dissolving MMA with acetone\nTransfer entire coverslip into a Petri dish filled with 15 mL of acetone. Incubate for 30 min.\nUsing a clean glass serological pipette, transfer acetone, in which the grids were incubated, to a waste container. Carefully add 15 mL of fresh acetone to the Petri dish using a clean glass serological pipette. Incubate for 30 min.\nRepeat these wash steps for a total of 3 acetone washes.\n9. Removing residual acetone with isopropanol\nFollowing 3 acetone washes, remove acetone and replace with 15 mL of isopropanol using a clean glass serological pipette. Incubate for 20 min.",
    "Repeat 3x for a total of 4 isopropanol washes. Carefully remove grids from isopropanol and air dry on a clean coverslip using tweezers.\n\tNOTE: Residual isopropanol can make it difficult to release grids from tweezers. Making contact between the grid and the clean coverslip prior to releasing the grid from the tweezers can alleviate this problem.\nEvaporate residual organics by transferring the coverslip with graphene-coated grids onto a hotplate set to 100 °C for 10 min. Cool to room temperature and store under vacuum until use.\n10. UV/ozone treatment of graphene-coated grids\nUsing reverse-action tweezers, gently place grids into a clean illumination area of a UV/ozone cleaner with the graphene-coated side facing up.\nSlide the illumination area closed and turn the machine ON. Turn the time dial to the designated treatment time to begin UV/ozone treating the grids..\n\tNOTE: Treatment duration is a tunable parameter, with excess treatment having the potential to damage the grid. Han et al.30 recommends 10 min of UV/ozone treatment, and we have also found a 10 min treatment to suffice. See step 12 for guidance on tuning this treatment time.\nProceed directly to plunging a cryoEM sample on the treated grids by following plunging steps as described in Koh et al.37.\n\tNOTE: Atmospheric hydrocarbons can accumulate on the grid surface after UV/ozone treatment and increase the hydrophobicity of the graphene surface38,39. To avoid this, plunge the UV/ozone treated grids immediately. It may be advantageous to UV/ozone treat grids in batches, for example, UV/ozone treating six grids and immediately plunging those six grids, then UV/ozone treating a second batch of grids, followed by plunging the second batch.\n11. Capturing a diffraction image\nEnsure that the microscope is well tuned with parallel illumination established and set final defocus to -0.2 µm.",
    "Insert the fluorescent screen and the beam stop fully. Enter diffraction mode to clearly visualize diffraction spots.\nAcquire an image using a CCD camera and evaluate it using image analysis software.\n\tNOTE: The most easily observed and identifiable diffraction spots generated by a graphene monolayer are 6 spots corresponding to a spatial frequency of 2.13 Å. Use a measurement tool to estimate the distance from the center of the diffracted beam to one of these diffraction spots in reciprocal units. Notably 2.13 Å imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/66023/66023eq01.jpg 0.47 Å-1.\n12. Assessing grid hydrophilicity\nPrepare the imaging setup. Locate a phone stand, tabletop imaging surface, phone with camera, glass coverslip, and paraffin film. Images shown here were obtained using a phone stand and tabletop imaging surface that were 3D printed using the provided .stl files, resulting in more easily reproducible and quantifiable contact angle measurements (Supplementary Figure 1A).\nLay a glass coverslip onto the flat surface, then cut a 1 cm by 1 cm square of paraffin film and place it onto the glass coverslip. Place phone on the phone stand, orienting the phone such that the camera is in-plane with the glass coverslip. Secure phone in this position using rubber bands (Supplementary Figure 1B). Take a sample photo to verify that the camera is aligned with the imaging surface.\nDirectly after UV/ozone treatment of graphene-coated grids, place a single grid onto the square of paraffin film on the glass coverslip. Ensure the graphene side is facing upwards. Add a 2 µL water droplet onto the center of the grid surface with a pipette and immediately take a photo.",
    "NOTE: Repeat this step after: i) desired intervals of UV/ozone treatment to determine a sufficient length of treatment; or ii) desired time intervals post UV/ozone treatment to measure how long after treatment the grid surface maintains its hydrophilic character.\nCalculate contact angles from photos by importing them into ImageJ43 and using the contact angle plugin.\n13. Single particle analysis of the dCas9 complex dataset\nNOTE: All image processing described in this protocol was performed using cryoSPARC version 4.2.1.\nPreprocess movies using Patch Motion Correction and Patch CTF Estimation jobs. Perform particle picking using the Blob picker job, using a spherical blob ranging in diameter from 115 Å to 135 Å.\nExtract particles using the Extract from micrographs job, using normalized correlation coefficient (NCC) and power thresholds resulting in approximately 200-300 particles per micrograph. Note that appropriate thresholds and resulting particle count may vary, and users should inspect pick quality across a range of micrographs to identify suitable conditions.\nPerform multiclass initial reconstructions using the Ab-initio reconstruction job, requiring three classes. Two of the three classes will likely contain non-Cas9 particles, including surface contaminants. Select the class resembling dCas9 for further processing.\n\tNOTE: Additional rounds of multiclass Ab-initio reconstruction or Heterogeneous refinement may be applied to further refine the particle stack.\nPerform 3D refinement using the Non-uniform Refinement job selecting default parameters. Estimate resolution of the reconstruction using the Validation (FSC), and ThreeDFSC jobs, employing the maps and mask from the final 3D refinement.\nSubscription Required.
