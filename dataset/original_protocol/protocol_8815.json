    "1. Body Wall Preparation\nNOTE: Preparation of third instar larval body walls (for study of the NMJs which innervate the body wall muscles) was performed as previously described in Brent et al. 10, or Ramachandran and Budnik 11,12, but with some modifications.\nDissection\n\t\nRaise fly stocks and crosses at 25 °C for five to six days using standard procedures 13.\nPick crawling third instar larvae from vials or bottles using fine forceps.\nWash the larvae in a small Petri dish containing Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) to remove any food particles.\nPlace a single larva onto a sylgard disc and immerse it in a few drops of ice-cold PBS. Using ice-cold PBS will help stun the larva making it easier to manipulate. Throughout the dissection, ensure that the preparation is always submerged in PBS to prevent it from drying.\nPosition the larva with its dorsal side facing up so that the two tracheal tracts are visible under a dissecting microscope (Figure 2A). Using the forceps to grasp a minutien pin, pin the larva down at the posterior end near the spiracles (Figure 2B). With another pin, pierce through the cuticle at the anterior end near the mouth hooks. Gently stretch the larva out lengthwise, then pin it down (Figure 2B).\nUsing microdissection scissors, pinch the posterior end near the pin to create a small opening. The incision should be superficial enough to just pass through the cuticle.\nPlacing the tip of the bottom blade of the scissors into the incision, cut along the entire length of the dorsal midline between the two tracheal tracts (Figure 2C). Point the scissor blades slightly upwards when cutting to avoid damaging the ventral body wall muscles.",
    "Make a small horizontal incision slightly anterior to the posteriorly-placed pin (Figure 2C). Make another similar incision slightly posterior to the anteriorly-placed pin (Figure 2C). The incisions should just pass through the cuticle.\n\t\tNOTE: The three incisions from steps 1.1.7 and 1.1.8 combined should resemble an \"imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52139/52139_letter_I.jpg\" when completed, i.e., a left- and right-hand flap on the dorsal side of the larval body should be produced.\nCarefully clean out the internal organs with the forceps. Adding a few forceful drops of PBS will help displace the organs out of the larval body, thus making it easier to remove them. Avoid poking the larval body as it will cause damage to the body wall muscles.\nUnfurl the larval body open and pin the corners down (Figure 2D). When pinning, stretch the body wall both horizontally and vertically to form an evenly-tensioned rectangle (see Figure 2G for the shape), taking care not to tear the body wall muscles in the process.\nFinish removing any remaining internal organs (Figure 2E).\nFixation and Permeabilization\n\t\nImmerse the pinned body walls in several drops of Bouin's Solution. Incubate for 15 min on ice. Alternatively, use 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) as an alternative fixative; incubate for 30 min.\nRinse three times with Phosphate Buffer Saline with Triton (PBT).\nUsing fine forceps, carefully remove the pins and transfer the body walls by their corners into a siliconized 0.65 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nStore the body walls in PBT at 4 °C until ready for PLA. For optimal results, start immunostaining the body walls within a day or two of dissection.",
    "NOTE: To save on reagents and to ensure that all body walls are treated equally during the assay, different genotypes can be placed into a single tube. Genotypes can be distinguished by cutting the corners of the body walls differently (see Figure 2F for examples).\n2. Immunohistochemistry\nNOTE: Immunostaining of third instar larval body walls was performed as previously described in Brent et al. 14 and Ramachandran and Budnik 11, but with some modifications 11,14.\nNOTE: Perform all steps at room temperature and with gentle agitation unless otherwise stated.\nBlocking\n\t\nWash the body walls with PBT three times for 10 min each.\nBlock with 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) for 1 hr.\nImmunostaining\n\t\nIncubate the body walls with mouse and rabbit primary antibodies against the two proteins of interest (diluted in 1% BSA) for 2 hr at room temperature, or overnight at 4 °C. In this case, use 1:10 mouse anti-Dlg and 1:250 rabbit anti-HtsM 15,16. Antibodies against markers that are not made in mouse or rabbit can also be included — e.g., use 1:200 goat anti-Hrp to delineate the neuronal membranes.\nWash with PBT three times for 10 min each.\nIncubate with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies to detect the markers (diluted in 1% BSA) for 2 hr at room temperature, or overnight at 4 °C. As the PLA signal is later visualized with a red fluorophore, another fluorophore must be used to detect the marker — e.g., use 1:200 FITC-conjugated anti-goat to detect the goat anti-Hrp antibody. Due to the use of light-sensitive reagents, keep the tubes in the dark from this point onwards.",
    "NOTE: The kit that is used allows for PLA to be performed between primary antibodies raised in mouse and rabbit, with the signal visualized on the red channel under confocal microscopy. If desired, other kits are available that allow the assay to be done with primary antibodies raised in other species, and the signal visualized on other channels.\n3. Proximity Ligation Assay\nNOTE: Perform all steps at room temperature and with gentle agitation unless otherwise stated.\nPLA Probes\n\t\nWash the body walls with PBT three times for 10 min each.\nIncubate with PLA probes (1:5 dilution each in 1% BSA) for 2 hr at 37 °C. In this case, use 40 µl of PLA probe anti-mouse MINUS, 40 µl of PLA probe anti-rabbit PLUS and 120 µl of 1% BSA to ensure the proper immersion and mixing of 5-10 body walls. Up to a 1:25 dilution of the PLA probes can still result in an adequate signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., for this experiment).\nLigation\n\t\nWash the body walls with Wash Buffer A twice for 5 min each.\nIncubate with Ligation solution (1:40 dilution of Ligase in Ligation buffer) for 1 hr at 37 °C. In this case, use 5 µl of Ligase, 40 µl of 5 Ligation buffer and 155 µl of high purity water to ensure the proper immersion and mixing of 5-10 body walls.\nAmplification\n\t\nWash the body walls with Wash Buffer A twice for 2 min each.\nIncubate with Amplification solution (1:80 dilution of Polymerase in Amplification buffer) for 2 hr at 37 °C. In this case, use 2.5 µl of Polymerase, 40 µl of 5 Amplification buffer and 157.5 µl of high purity water to ensure the proper immersion and mixing of 5-10 body walls.\nPreparation for Imaging",
    "Wash the body walls with Wash Buffer B twice for 10 min each.\nWash with 0.01x Wash Buffer B once for 1 min.\nEquilibrate in a few drops of mounting solution for at least 30 min before mounting, or store overnight at 4 °C.\nUsing fine forceps, carefully transfer the body walls onto a platform slide with their cuticles facing down. Position the body walls in rows and in the same orientation within a drop or two of mountant. Place a 22 mm x 40 mm coverslip over the preparation taking care not to generate air bubbles, then seal the slide with clear nail polish.\nStore the slides in the dark at -20 °C until ready for confocal imaging.\nSubscription Required.
