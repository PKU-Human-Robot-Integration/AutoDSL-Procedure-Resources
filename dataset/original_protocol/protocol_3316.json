    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDissect the left ventricle\nTiming: 30 min\nE12.5 left ventricles are collected under a dissection microscope.\nE12.5 BmxCreER;R26fsGFP mouse embryos are collected from the pregnant female mice which were sacrificed immediately after anesthesia after inhaling isoflurane, and their hearts are isolated using autoclaved scissors and forceps and collected in cold DPBS.\nNote: No perfusion is necessary as we collected the embryonic ventricle for culture.\nCheck the hearts’ GFP expression under a fluorescent microscope, the GFP positive hearts are BmxCreER;R26fsGFP and the endocardial cells are labeled by GFP. The subsequent experiments are using these GFP positive hearts.\nDissect out the left ventricle from the heart using a fine forceps as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3082-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissecting the left ventricle\nRV: right ventricle; LV: left ventricle.\nNote: The whole heart was in the cold DPBS in 60mm Petri dishes.\nuse one forceps to hold the heart on the bottom of the Petri dishes.\nuse another forceps to dissect the left ventricle as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nput the left ventricles in cold DPBS on ice.\nNote: Please don’t too long time on ice, we usually put on ice for no longer than 2 hours.\nMake sandwiched left ventricular explant culture\nTiming: 9 days\nLeft ventricular explants are sandwiched in the Matrigel media and cultured within the Matrigel media as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3082-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Make sandwiched left ventricular explant culture\nMake the Matrigel media freshly on ice, add 150 μL/well Matrigel media to a 4-well dish\nNote: Please use the 1000 μL precooled (4°C) pipette to add Matrigel media.\nNote: Please make 300 μL/well Matrigel media here, use 150 μL/well this step and the remaining 150 μl/well Matrigel media was kept on ice and will be used in the 7th step.",
    "Put the Matrigel media-coated 4-well dish in 37°C 5% CO2 cell culture incubator for 25–30 min to allow the Matrigel polymerized (solidified).\nCritical: The incubation time is key and needs to be optimized for good ventricular explant culture. Too short incubation time will lead the ventricle to attach to the dish bottom and too long time will lead the ventricle to poorly growth on the Matrigel media.\nNote: If one can finish the dissection step within 25 min, one can make the Matrigel media first, and then do the dissection step during Matrigel media incubation time. Otherwise, do the dissection step first (put the left ventricle on the ice) and then make the Matrigel media incubation.\nPipette 1 to 3 left ventricles in DPBS using a 3 mL transfer pipette and put them on one well of a Matrigel media coated 4-well dish. Allow the cutting side of left ventricles facing the bottom and gently remove the extra DPBS using a 20 μl pipette\nNote: We usually culture one to three ventricles/well in the 4-well dish.\nAdd slowly another 150 μL Matrigel media per well and incubate for 30 min in 37°C 5% CO2 cell culture incubator to let the Matrigel solidified.\nAdd 200 μL/well ventricular explant culture Basal Media supplemented with 2 ng/mL TGFb2 (Conditional Media 1) and use ventricular explant culture Basal Media without TGFb2 as control. Culture the sandwiched left ventricles in 37°C 5% CO2 cell culture incubator for one day and today is day 0. On day 1 and day 2, carefully remove whole conditional media 1 with 100 μL pipette and change to fresh conditional media 1 for two days.",
    "Alternatives: We can add 200 μL/well ventricular explant culture Basal Media supplemented with 10 ng/mL TGFb2 (Conditional Media 2) and use ventricular explant culture Basal Media without TGFb2 as control. Culture the sandwiched left ventricles in a 37°C 5% CO2 cell culture incubator for one day and today is the day 0. On day 1 and day 2, carefully remove whole conditional media 2 with 100 μL pipette and change to fresh Basal Media for two days.\nOn the day 3, switch to ventricular explant culture Basal Media supplemented with 10 ng/mL VEGF120 (Conditional media 3), carefully change the culture media every other day (change to fresh conditional media 3 on the day 5 and day 7) for another 6 days.\nNote: Take images of cultured left ventricles under the fluorescent microscope on day 3, 6, and 9 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) to document coronary angiogenesis and formation of coronary networks.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3082-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
