    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBelow we provide a detailed step-by-step protocol about the AtGLR3.4 protein purification, sample preparation, and cryo-EM structure determination (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1057-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Overview of the protocol of AtGLR3.4 protein expression, purification, sample preparation, and cryo-EM structure determination\nThe image has been created using BioRender (https://biorender.com/[href=https://biorender.com/]).\nBacmid preparation and isolation\nTiming: 4 days\nAccording to the manufacturer protocol, bacmid preparation and isolation were carried out using DH10Bac competent cells (Bac-to-Bac, Invitrogen). The steps are described here.\nFor transposition, prepare LB agar plates containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin, 7 μg/mL gentamicin, 10 μg/mL tetracycline, 200 μg/mL Bluo-gal and 40 μg/mL IPTG.\nTransformation of bacmid\nThaw DH10Bac (Life Technologies Cat#10361012) competent cells on ice and dispense 25–30 μL to a prechilled 1.5-mL polypropylene tube.\nAdd approximately 1–10 ng (1–2 μL) of plasmid DNA (pEG BacMam_AtGLR3.4) and mix gently by flicking/tapping the tube several times.\nIncubate on ice for 15–30 min.\nTransfer the tube to a water bath at 42°C for 45 s.\nAfter heat shock, immediately transfer the tube back to ice and let it cool on ice for 2–3 min.\nAdd 200 μL SOC media to the tube and transfer to an incubator shaker set at 220 rpm and incubate for 4 h at 37°C.\nPipette 20–100 μL of transformation reaction on the plates and spread evenly.\nGrow transformed cells\nIncubate the plates for at least 24 h at 37°C. Blue and white colonies will appear; for better results, incubate the plates for 48 h to distinguish the blue from the white colonies.\nCarefully inoculate a single white colony in 5–6 mL LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/mL kanamycin, 7 μg/mL gentamicin, and 10 μg/mL tetracycline.\nIncubate for 12–15 h at 37°C with continuous rotation at 220–250 rpm.\nPause point: Overnight (12–16 h)\nIsolate bacmid DNA",
    "Centrifuge the culture at ∼3,100 g for 10 min. Then, decant to discard the supernatant and save the cell pellet.\nNote: If needed, the pellet can be stored at −20°C for up to a couple of weeks prior to bacmid DNA isolation. For bacmid isolation, we use reagents from the Promega mini prep kit. Reagents from other mini prep kits can also be used.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL resuspension buffer until homogeneous, via pipetting up and down and/or by vortexing. Transfer the suspension to a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube.\nAdd 200 μL lysis buffer and mix by gently inverting the tube several (∼15–20) times. The suspension in the tube turns slightly viscous.\nAdd 200 μL neutralization buffer and mix by gentle inversion several (∼20) times. A white precipitate will be observed.\nCentrifuge the tube at ∼21,100 g for 10 min at ∼20°C–25°C.\nAvoiding the pellet, carefully collect and transfer the supernatant to a fresh 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube. In the fume hood, add an equal volume (typically around 500–600 μL) of Tris equilibrated Phenol:Chloroform: Isoamyl-alcohol (25:24:1) and mix by inverting gently several times for 1 min.\nSpin at ∼21,100 g for 5 min at ∼20°C–25°C. In the fume hood, gently collect the top layer supernatant (∼500–600 μL) and transfer it to a new 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube. Add 2× volume (∼1–1.2 mL) of ice-cold 100% ethanol, mix well by gently inverting for 30 s, and incubate at −20°C for a minimum of 30 min.\nCentrifuge at ∼21,100 g for 20–30 min at 4°C. A white pellet is observed at the bottom of the tube. Carefully decant to discard the supernatant and add 1 mL ice-cooled 70% ethanol.\nInvert the tube gently several times to wash the pellet. Centrifuge for 5 min at ∼21,100 g at 4°C.",
    "Discard the supernatant by gentle aspiration (make sure to not discard the pellet as it may dislodge from the bottom).\nTo avoid traces of remaining ethanol, air dry the pellet for 15–20 min at ∼20°C–25°C in a fume hood. Add 40–50 μL of autoclaved milli-Q water and dissolve the pellet by gentle tapping/flicking. Once the pellet is dissolved, place the tube with bacmid DNA on ice. Now the bacmid DNA is ready to be used for baculovirus production and can be stored at −80°C for an extended period.\nTransfection of Sf9 cells with recombinant bacmid DNA\nTiming: 4–6 days\nProduction of the first-generation baculovirus (P1 virus).\nNote: The following steps should be performed under sterile conditions in a laminar hood.\nIn a 6-well plate, add 2 mL of Sf9 cells per well, with the Sf9 cell density of 0.5–0.75 ×106/mL (1–1.5 ×106 cells per P1 virus). Allow the cells to adhere for 30 min to 1 h in a dark incubator at 27°C.\nIn the meantime, take a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube and add:\n180 μL of SF900 media\n10 μL of Cellfectin II\n10 μL of thawed bacmid DNA\nClose and tap the tube to mix. Let mixture sit for 20–30 min in the hood.\nAdd the mixture of SF900 media, bacmid DNA, and Cellfectin II dropwise to the cells in the well.\nIncubate the plate at 27°C for 4–6 days. Observe the plate under the microscope to monitor cell behavior and fluorescence if the gene of interest is fused with a fluorescent marker gene.",
    "Note: It is always better to have a fluorescent marker fused to the protein of interest to monitor baculovirus preparation and protein expression. The AtGLR3.4 P1 virus is typically harvested on the 5th day post-transfection because most of the cells already express the protein (monitored by eGFP fluorescence), while very little cell death is observed.\nTo harvest the P1 virus, filter the 2 mL medium using a 0.2 μm sterile syringe filter in a laminar hood and store the filtered virus at 4°C protected from light. The P1 virus can be stored for 4–6 months.\nP2 virus production\nTiming: 5 days\nNote: The following steps (except for centrifugation and resuspension) should be performed under sterile conditions in a laminar hood.\nIn a laminar hood and sterile conditions, infect 500 mL of Sf9 cells at a cell density of 1.5×106 cells/mL in a 1-L non-baffled Erlenmeyer flask by adding 500 μL of P1 virus. Incubate the Sf9 cell culture in a shaker at 27°C and 115 rpm for 72–120 h. Keep the cell culture protected from light.\nCentrifuge the culture at ∼5,000 g for 15 min at 4°C in a Sorvall centrifuge. Discard the cell pellet and save the supernatant containing the P2 virus.\nUltracentrifuge the supernatant at 4°C for 1 h at ∼61,000 g in a preparative ultracentrifuge with a Type 45Ti Beckman Coulter rotor.\nA small translucent pellet is observed at the bottom of the tube. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 50 or 25 mL Gibco FreeStyle 293 expression media supplemented with 2% of γ-irradiated fetal bovine serum (FBS) to get 10× or 20× concentrated P2 virus, respectively.\nNote: Always run the FBS through a 0.22 μm filter before adding to the media (perform this procedure under sterile conditions in a laminar hood).",
    "Pass the resuspension through a 0.22 μm filter into a sterile 50-mL tube and store at 4°C well protected from light. The P2 virus stock can be stored for 1–2 months at 4°C while protected from light.\nNote: To fully dissolve the pellet, allow it to stay in the resuspension media in the dark at 4°C for no longer than 24 hours prior to filtration.\nTransduction of HEK 293S GnTI− cells with P2 baculovirus\nTiming: 3 days\nIn a laminar hood and sterile conditions, prepare 800 mL of HEK 293S GnTI− cell culture at the density of 2.5–3.5 × 106 cells/mL maintained in Freestyle 293 media supplemented with 2% FBS in 2-L baffled Erlenmeyer flask and add 8 mL of 20× concentrated P2 virus stock. Incubate the cell culture at 37°C in an orbital shaker at 110 rpm and 5% CO2.\nTo enhance the protein expression, add 10 mM of sodium butyrate to the culture 12–20 h post-transduction and decrease the incubator temperature to 30°C.\nAfter 72–74 h post-transduction, harvest the cells by centrifugation at ∼5,000 g (in a Sorvall RC 5B Plus centrifuge) for 15 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant, wash the cell pellet by resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 8.0), and transfer the suspension to a 50-mL Falcon tube. Centrifuge at ∼3,100 g for 10 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant and store the cell pellet at −80°C until further use.\nPurification of AtGLR3.4\nTiming: 2 days\nNote: The buffers should be filtered using 0.22 μm filter (Merck-Millipore) and chilled to 4°C prior to utilization. When required, add β-mercaptoethanol (βME) and protease inhibitors right before buffer usage. All protein purification steps are to be carried out at 4°C or on ice, unless otherwise noted.",
    "Resuspend the cell pellet in ice-cold Cell Lysis buffer. Add a stir bar and ∼40 mL of the Cell Lysis buffer to the 50-mL falcon tube with the frozen cell pellet till it reaches 45-mL volume and resuspend the pellet by rocking on a platform or by vortexing until the cell pellet becomes detached and dissolved.\nDisrupt the cells by sonication using Misonix Sonicator with a preset program with six cycles (3 min total process time) at the amplitude of 8, 15 s pulse on time, and 15 s pulse off time. The sonication steps must be carried out on a stir plate (at medium speed stirring) on ice or at 4°C to avoid heating and denaturing of the protein. Repeat this process 2 more times or until optimal cell lysis.\nNote: For optimal cell lysis, check a small droplet of the lysate under a light microscope to confirm that cells are lysed post-sonication, as the appearance will be distinctly different from cells prior to sonication.\nCentrifuge the cell lysate suspension at ∼3,100 g (using an Eppendorf Centrifuge 5810) for 10 min at 4°C to remove cell debris and unbroken cells.\nCollect the clarified supernatant by decanting the supernatant into a prechilled polycarbonate bottle assembly for ultracentrifugation. Ultracentrifuge in a Type 45Ti Beckman Coulter fixed-angle rotor at ∼186,000 g for 1 h at 4°C to obtain the membrane fraction.\nDiscard the supernatant and mechanically homogenize the obtained membrane fraction pellet in Cell Lysis buffer (∼25 mL) using a homogenizer.\nNote: We use a prechilled dounce homogenizer and move a plunger forth and back at least 6 times to fully homogenize the pellet in the Cell Lysis buffer.",
    "Solubilize the membrane protein from the homogenate by adding an equal volume of solubilization buffer to the homogenate (totaling ∼50 mL with a final ∼1% concentration of the detergent, digitonin in our case) and stir/rotate (low-medium speed to prevent bubble formation) at 4°C for ∼2 h (1 h minimum).\nUltracentrifuge the solubilizate at ∼186,000 g in a Type 45Ti Beckman Coulter fixed-angle rotor at 4°C for 1 h to remove insoluble material.\nCollect the supernatant and add 2 mL of strep resin prewashed and equilibrated in T buffer. Rotate the mix for 12–14 h at 4°C.\nPause point: overnight (12–15 h)\nPurify the protein using affinity chromatography.\nEquilibrate 30-mL chromatography gravity column by rinsing column with milli-Q water and allowing SEC buffer to flow through.\nTransfer the AtGLR3.4 protein-bound strep resin to the empty pre-equilibrated gravity chromatography column and collect the flow-through.\nWash the resin by pouring 25 mL of SEC buffer into the column.\nElute the AtGLR3.4 protein with ∼10–15 mL of freshly made Strep Elution buffer. Observe the eGFP-tagged protein eluting from the column by the color of the collected protein appearing green and the resin becoming white. No more Strep Elution buffer is needed once the strep resin is white, stripped of its eGFP green color, indicating that the protein has been eluted from the column.\nNote: When adding buffer to the column, wait until the buffer from the previous step is almost finished flowing through the column but do not let the column run dry.\nMeasure the concentration of the protein, add 1/300 (w/w) thrombin and incubate at 22°C for 90 min to cleave off eGFP and the strep tag. Protein concentration can be measured using a spectrophotometer set to A280 (absorbance at 280 nm) and blanked with the elution buffer.",
    "Note: Successful thrombin cleavage can be monitored by fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC) (Kawate and Gouaux, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) and SDS-PAGE (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nConcentrate the thrombin digest reaction to ∼500 μL using 100-kDa NMWL centrifugal filter.\nTransfer the concentrated protein to a new 1.5-mL tube and centrifuge the concentrated protein at ∼86,500 g for 30 min at 4°C using a Sorvall MTX150 Micro-Ultracentrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a S100AT4 rotor.\nAvoiding the pellet, inject the supernatant into a 500-μL loop connected to a Superose™ 6 10/300 GL SEC column attached to an AKTA FPLC (GE Healthcare) and pre-equilibrated in SEC Buffer.\nAt the end of the SEC column run at 0.5 mL/min, pool the peak fractions corresponding to AtGLR3.4 tetramer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) and concentrate to 3–4 mg/mL using 100-kDa NMWL centrifugal filter. Typically, ∼800 mL of HEK 293S GnTI− cell culture yields ∼1 mg of purified protein. The concentrated, purified protein can be stored at 4°C, structurally stable, and functionally active for one week.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1057-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. On the left, FSEC traces for AtGLR3.4 before (blue) and after (red) thrombin cleavage\nThe chromatograms were recorded using Superose 6 column at the flow rate of 0.5 mL/min using eGFP fluorescence (excitation, 488 nm; emission, 507 nm). On the right, SDS-PAGE demonstrating AtGLR3.4 bands before and after thrombin digest at two (1/1,000 and 1/300) thrombin/AtGLR3.4-eGFP ratios.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1057-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. On the left, SEC profile for purified AtGLR3.4",
    "The chromatogram was recorded using Superose 6 column at the flow rate of 0.5 mL/min using A280 absorbance. In the middle, SDS-PAGE for the protein peak fractions outlined by the red dashed lines on the SEC plot. On the right, normalized FSEC traces for purified AtGLR3.4, rat GluA2-γ2 fusion (Twomey et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16], 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]), mouse TRPV3 (Nadezhdin et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Singh et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) and human TRPV6 (Bhardwaj et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; McGoldrick et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). The latter three membrane proteins represent molecular weight markers and confirm the tetrameric assembly of AtGLR3.4. The chromatograms were recorded using Superose 6 column at the flow rate of 0.5 mL/min using tryptophan fluorescence (excitation, 280 nm; emission, 334 nm).\nInspect the purity of the protein by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).\nOptional: Protein purity can also be assessed by FSEC.\nGrid sample preparation\nTiming: 2–3 h\nFor cryo-EM grid sample preparation, use UltrAuFoil CF-1.2/1.3-2Au 200 mesh holey carbon grids covered with a thin layer of gold according to the published method (Russo and Passmore, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]).\nOptional: The user can optimize various grid types and vitrification parameters however they see fit.\nDeposit ∼50 nm of gold onto the grids using gold wire and the Edwards Auto 306 evaporator.\nNote: This grid gold-coating step is only necessary for carbon-coated grids.\nThen remove the carbon with the Gatan Solarus (model 950) Advanced Plasma Cleaning System Ar/O2 treatment (4 min, 50 watts, 35.0 sccm Ar, 11.5 sccm O2).\nNote: This carbon removal step is only necessary after the previous grid gold-coating step.",
    "Before applying the purified protein sample to the gold-coated side of the grid, subject the grids to a H2/O2 plasma treatment using the Gatan Solarus (model 950) Advanced Plasma Cleaning System (20 s, 10 watts, 6.4 sccm H2, 27.5 sccm O2) with the gold-coated side facing up.\nNote: Glow discharging step could be used as an alternative to plasma cleaning.\nPrior to applying the purified protein to the grid, ultracentrifuge the protein at ∼86,500 g for 30 min at 4°C using a SorvallMTX150 Micro-Ultracentrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and a S100AT4 rotor. Transfer the supernatant to a prechilled tube, avoiding any possible protein precipitation.\nFor vitrification, set the vitrobot to 4°C with 100% humidity, a 15 s wait time, and a 4–5 s blot time with a 4–5 blot force. Apply 3 μL of purified AtGLR3.4 protein at 3–3.5 mg/mL to the gold-coated side of the grid and plunge freeze the grid into liquid ethane cooled to ∼−190°C in liquid nitrogen using a Mark IV vitrobot (Thermo fisher scientific).\nNote: After grids are plunge frozen, they must remain at cryogenic temperatures and avoid contamination as well as exposure to humidity or condensation.\nPause point: The prepared grids can stay in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nGrid screening, cryo-EM data collection, and processing\nTiming: 2–4 weeks\nTest the grids on screening transmission electron microscopes (TEMs), such as Glacios or F20 (FEI Thermo Scientific), and assess particle distribution, orientation, and ice quality.\nNote: The grids can be loaded onto the F20 microscope straight from the grid storage box. However, the grids need to be clipped before being screened on the Glacios microscope.",
    "Collect cryo-EM data from the prescreened grids on a FEI Titan Krios TEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) operating at 300 kV and equipped with a direct electron detection (DED) camera in counting mode with ∼50 frames per movie and a total dose of ∼58 electrons per Å2, a physical pixel size of ∼0.83 Å, and a defocus value between −0.5 to −2.5 μm. We used Krios with a post-column GIF Quantum energy filter and a Gatan K3 Summit DED camera, Gatan, Pleasanton, CA, USA.\nProcess the data in RELION 3.1 (Zivanov et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]) or CryoSparc (Punjani et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Perform beam-induced motion correction using MotionCor2 (Dose per frame of 1.16, EER fractionation -32, B Factor -150, number of patches 5×5) (Zheng et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]) and contrast transfer function (CTF) estimation using CTFFIND4.1 (Zhang, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]) in RELION 3.1.\nNote: All the processing steps can also be performed in cryoSPARC.\nManually pick ∼3,000 particles by selecting any particle shape that commonly appears in the micrographs, recognizing reoccurring shapes as well as any shape that potentially resembles an iGluR.\nNote: We used the particle/mask diameter of 230 Å.\n2D-classify these manually selected particles to generate templates for further template-based auto picking in RELION 3.1.\n4×4 bin the picked particle images to a pixel size of ∼3.32 Å/pixel and subject them to 3D classification into 10 classes (C1 symmetry). Select the best classes, which corresponded to the Y shape of iGluR (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1057-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Cryo-EM processing workflow\nNote: A model-generated iGluR map (for example, using the GluA2 model, PDB: 3KG2 (Sobolevsky et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15])), low-pass filtered to 40 Å, can be used as an initial reference.\nExtract particles for the best 3D classes without binning to an original pixel size (∼0.83 Å/pixel).",
    "Perform 3D refinement using C2 symmetry in RELION 3.1. At this step, the postprocessed map from RELION had the resolution of ∼3.98 Å (FSC = 0.143) from 277,615 particles (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nCarry out micelle subtraction. For micelle subtraction, first create a mask using 3D refined map as input from the last 3D refinement step in Relion. Then run Particle subtraction using optimizer.star file from the last 3D refinement step and the mask as an input. Carry out multiple rounds of 3D classification (C1 symmetry) without angular sampling to reduce particle heterogeneity followed by 3D refinement. Also, perform Bayesian polishing and CTF refinement.\nNote: Vary the regularization parameter (T) and iterations for 3D classification. We used T= 4 and iterations = 40 in 3D classification without angular sampling. Multiple rounds of 3D classification into 8 classes followed by 3D refinement on the particles from the best class using C2 symmetry and postprocessing yielded a map with resolution of 3.73Å from 118,592 particles (FSC=0.143) in RELION. Every time we used the 3D refined map from the previous job as an input reference in the subsequent 3D classification job.\nTo improve the map quality, import the particles from the last 3D refinement job from RELION to cryoSPARC and clean them up by 2D classification.\nSelect the best 2D classes and subject the corresponding particles to homogeneous and non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC applying C2 symmetry. The map after non-uniform refinement in cryoSPARC had a resolution of 3.57 Å (FSC = 0.143) (Chen et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) from 110,630 particles.\nEstimate the local resolution using the unfiltered half-maps and Resmap (Kucukelbir et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nNote: Local resolution can also be estimated in cryoSPARC.\nUse UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) to visualize the EM density maps.\nModel building and refinement\nTiming: 1–2 weeks",
    "Once the high-resolution cryo-EM map is obtained, build atomic models of AtGLR3.4.\nAs guides, use the crystal structure of AtGLR3.4-S1S2 (PDB: 7LZ0) (Green et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) to build the ligand-binding domain and homology modeling in SWISS-MODEL (Waterhouse et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]) using the GluA2 crystal structure as a guide (PDB: 3KG2, (Sobolevsky et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15])) to build the amino terminal and transmembrane domains. Finalize the model building manually using COOT (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nNote: Since AtGLR3.4 is a tetramer, it is advisable to first build two subunits, A and B, and then duplicate the AB dimer following the C2 symmetry of the map to make the CD dimer and assemble the ABCD tetramer.\nRefine the obtained atomic model of AtGLR3.4 in real-space using PHENIX (Adams et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nValidate the model quality. For this purpose, we used the validation programs MolProbity (score = 1.69, clash score = 4.49, poor rotamers = 0.44%) (Williams et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]) and EMRinger (EMRinger score = 2.41, optimal Threshold = 0.67, Rotamer-ratio = 0.77) (Barad et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) in Phenix."
