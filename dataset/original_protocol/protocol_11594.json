    "This method has been approved by the Office of Regulatory Affairs at the University of Pennsylvania. For the research studies described herein, informed consent was obtained from each adult and informed assent from each child seven years of age or older.\n1. General Considerations\nConduct the preference test in a comfortable, private room that ideally has a sink for subjects to expectorate solutions during testing. If a sink is not available, give subjects a cup into which to expectorate.\n2. Test Materials\nObtain 1-L volumetric flasks, 1-L amber glass bottles, and 100 ml amber glass bottles for the preparation, storage, and dispensing of solutions. For testing, obtain the following materials: 30 ml disposable medicine cups for solutions; drinking cups containing water for rinsing in between trials; a stopwatch to monitor inter-pair and inter-series intervals; distilled water for solution preparation and for rinsing; a cup for expectoration (if the testing room does not contain a sink); a sheet of paper labeled with the numbers 1 and 2 representing the order of tasting; and a tracking grid (Figure 1) for recording data.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54163/54163fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Weigh the appropriate amount of sucrose to make solutions A through E (Table 1).\nMaking one solution at a time, place the appropriate grams of sucrose (Table 1) in 1 L volumetric flask and fill to the line on the flask with distilled water. Mix to dissolve the sucrose. Once sucrose is dissolved, transfer the solution to the appropriately labeled 1 L amber glass bottle.",
    "Store the solution-containing bottles in the refrigerator (4 °C) for a maximum of one week. Repeat step 2.3 to make the remaining four solutions. Solutions will be enough to test approximately 25-30 subjects.\nConstruct tracking grid to record subject data, using template found in Figure 1. Label each grid with the Series number (1 or 2) and the concentrations of the sucrose solutions, and include space to record the start and end times of each series. Include a column on each grid to record notes as necessary during the test.\n3. Subject and Testing Preparation\nInstruct adults to abstain from eating or drinking and instruct parents to not give child participants anything to eat or drink for at least 1 hr before testing.\nTwo hr before testing, remove solutions from the refrigerator, transfer approximately 100 ml of each to the appropriately labeled 100 ml amber glass bottles, and allow the solutions to equilibrate to RT.\nSeat the subject at a table in front of the sheet of paper labeled with the numbers 1 and 2, and allow the subject to acclimate to the testing room and the tester for at least 10 min.\n4. Psychophysical Method\nNote: The preference test is a two-series, forced-choice, paired comparison tracking technique in which subjects are asked to taste (without swallowing) pairs of solutions of different concentrations and to point to the solution they prefer. Below are the introductory verbal instructions given to pediatric and adult subjects at the time of testing, followed by investigator instructions on how to conduct the preference test.\nVerbal Instructions to Subjects\nPediatric Subjects",
    "Show the cups to the subject and say: \"We're going to play a game with things to taste. Here are two cups. You will taste what's inside the first cup, swish it around your mouth, but don't swallow, and I will tell you when to spit it out in the sink (or cup). You will then rinse your mouth with water, and then taste what's inside the second cup. I will tell you when to spit it out. Then I want you to point to which one you like better-the first one or the second one. You will then rinse your mouth two times with water, and we will do this again. There is no right or wrong answer; we want to know which one you like better.\"\nAdolescents and Adults\nShow the cups to the subject and say: \"We're going to give you solutions to taste. Here are two cups. You will taste what's inside the first cup, swish it around your mouth, but don't swallow, and I will tell you when to spit it out in the sink (or cup). You will then rinse your mouth with water, and then taste what's inside the second cup. I will tell you when to spit it out. Then I want you to point to which one you like better-the first one or the second one. You will then rinse your mouth two times with water, and we will do this again. There are no right or wrong answers; we want to know which one you like better.\"\nInvestigator Instructions",
    "For Series 1, begin by placing two cups, respectively containing 5 ml of solution B and 5 ml of solution D on a sheet of paper labeled with the numbers 1 and 2 in front of the subject: Place solution B on number 1 to be tasted first. Place solution D on number 2 and have the participant taste second. In Series 1, always place the weaker (lower) concentration solution of the pair in the number 1 position. Using the grid in Figure 1, underline the concentration that is presented first (solution B).\nInstruct the subject to taste the solution in position 1 by swishing; after 5 sec instruct the subject to expectorate, to rinse his or her mouth with water, and to expectorate again.\nInstruct the subject to taste the solution in position 2 by swishing, and to expectorate after 5 sec.\nAsk the subject to point to the solution the subject likes better. If the subject says they like both, instruct the subject to again point to the one they like better. Circle the X on the grid (Figure 1) that corresponds to the subject's preferred concentration.\nInstruct the subject to rinse his or her mouth twice with water and to expectorate. Use the timer to wait 1 min before presenting the next pair of solutions.",
    "For the second comparison of solutions in Series 1, pair the preferred concentration from the first comparison with the lower adjacent concentration. For example, if the subject prefers solution D to solution B in the first pair, then present the second pair consisting of solutions C and D. Place solution C (the lower concentration) in position 1 and solution D in position 2. Indicate which solutions are being presented by marking X's on the grid and underline the X that corresponds to the solution presented in position 1 (in this case Solution C).\nRepeat this process until the subject chooses the same concentration when presented with both a lower and higher adjacent concentration (e.g., if the subject chooses C when paired both with B and with D), or when the subject chooses either the lowest (A) or the highest concentration (E) twice consecutively.\nRecord each subject's preferred concentration from Series 1 on the grid, and wait 3 min before beginning Series 2.\nFor Series 2, pour 5 ml of each of solutions B and D into disposable cups, and place solution D on number 1 and solution B on number 2 in front of the subject. In Series 2, the stronger (higher) concentration solution of the pair is always placed in the number 1 position. Using the grid, underline the concentration that is presented first (D).\nInstruct the subject to taste and expectorate the solutions following the protocol used for Series 1 as outlined in steps 4.2.2-4.2.8.",
    "For the second comparison of solutions in Series 2, pair the preferred concentration from the first comparison with the higher adjacent concentration. For example, if the subject prefers solution D to solution B in the first pair, present solutions E and D in the second pair, placing solution E (the higher concentration) in position 1.\nRepeat this process until the subject chooses the same concentration when presented with both a lower and higher adjacent concentration, or when the subject chooses either the lowest or the highest concentration twice consecutively.\nRecord the subject's preferred concentration from Series 2 by circling it on the grid.\nDetermine the subject's preferred level of sucrose by calculating the geometric mean of the concentrations chosen in the two series (the square root of the product of the two concentrations):\n\t\tGeometric Mean = √ (series 1 preference) x (series 2 preference)\nSubscription Required.
