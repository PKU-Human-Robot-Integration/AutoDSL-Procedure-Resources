    "Before the experiment Prepare antibiotic and B27 aliquots, and keep them at -20 °C. Prepare 1 mM of luciferin (see Recipes). Note: The aliquots should avoid repeat freeze/thaw cycles, optimally less than 5 times.Classify your animals according to their genotype to select homozygote knock-in (KI) mice for the transgene Per2::Luc; keep in mind that the heterogeneous KI/+ should have the half of the signal due to the presence of only one allele.Note: Probes that we used for PCR genotyping are the same as that described in Yoo et al. (2004).Prepare HBSS 1x and DMEM 1x under a clean fume hood (see Recipes).Note: Fresh HBSS 1x and DMEM 1x can be prepared on the day of experiment, but HBSS has to be cold enough. On the day of the experiment PreparationPrepare the DMEM medium ready-to-use by adding B27, antibiotics and luciferin (see Recipes).Note: It is not necessary to filter the medium again.Prepare sampling pot, for each animal, filled with HBSS 1x enough for the brain to bathe (around 10 ml).Prepare culture dishes as many as samples. Number them on the cover side. Put 1 ml of ready-to-use DMEM in each and cover the top with vacuum grease. The grease avoids the medium to evaporate at 37 °C: the samples will not dry and the apparatus will stay dry. Put the cover gently on its Petri dish and keep them at 37 °C in the incubator.Notes: Avoid red/pink ink. To open the LumiCycle and put the samples inside, it must be done under red light.To easily cover the top, first fill a 10 ml syringe with the grease (see Video 1). <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Petri dish sealing. This video shows how we use a syringe to seal Petri dishes cleanly.",
    "Clean the fume hood (horizontal flow) and all the equipment inside (stereomicroscope, lamp) with 70% EtOH. Clean the brain matrix and all the forceps with 70% EtOH and let them dry under the clean fume hood. Cover the brain matrix with aluminum paper and keep it at 4 °C at least 1 h before to cool it down.Note: It is also possible to put the matrix in the freezer to cool it faster but do not let it inside too much time. If the matrix is too cold, the brain will stick on it. If it happens, put some drops of HBSS medium on the brain and the matrix to take off the slices. SamplingKill the mouse by cervical dislocation. Then, obtain the brain quickly and keep it in HBSS 1x on ice/or in the fridge until dissection. To avoid degradation of the tissue (if all the procedure reaches more than ~1 h), we recommend starting with the sacrifice of one or two animals at once.Notes:  This sacrifice method is performed in accordance with the rules of the French National Law and the European Committee Council Directive of September 22, 2010 (2010/63/UE).We do not use sedation. You can use another method of sacrifice that allows you to obtain quickly the brain. If you need more than one sample, be careful at what time you are sampling. It is important for sampling at the same moment, or to check if sampling at different moment of the day is not affecting your data.We generally spent less than 1 min per animal to extract the brain after its death. DissectionPut the brain inside the matrix and slice it in a single act with the razor blade (around 500 µm of thickness).",
    "To place the brain upside down could be a solution to find anatomical landmarks as the optic chiasma, and find the location of the slice containing the area of interest with the help of a brain atlas (see Figure 2). It is also possible to section the whole brain (see Video 2) and, afterward select the slice where your structure of interest is.Note: We generally spent less than 2 min to slice the whole brain.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180702/20180702014736_4387.jpgFigure 2. Upside down mouse brain in the matrix. The optic chiasma pointed with the arrow can be used as an anatomical landmark.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Brain slicing with the mouse matrix Microdissection is done under the stereomicroscope in cold HBSS, in the glass and sterilized Petri dish. Try to minimize the sample to fit in 1 mm2: in this way, tissue will have access to all the nutrients needed easily, and avoid necrosis.Notes: It is also possible to use plastic culture dish, but after one or two microdissections, the scalpel leaves marks on it while it does not on glass. Also, glass Petri dish can be used again after sterilization.We usually use forceps to maintain the sample and scalpel to cut a square containing the structure of interest. However, it is important to microdissect only the area of interest if adjacent areas also oscillate. For example, the SCN fits in a square without any problem, while another brain structure of our interest, the habenula, needs to have all the other tissues around it removed. We generally spent between 3-5 min to microdissect according to the difficulty of the area of interest. If you have many brains, one person can slice the brain with the matrix while the second one is microdissecting to accelerate the experiment.",
    "Pick up the culture dish inside the incubator corresponding to the sample and put the cell culture insert (Millicell®) on the medium. It should not have any bubbles under it. If this is the case, take it out and put it back. Place your sample on the top of it with your forceps or by recovering your sample with your 1,000 µl pipette. Remove the remained HBSS1x on the top of the culture insert (see Video 3).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Sample dropping on the Millicell® culture insert Return the sample into the incubator until you collect all of them.Note: We generally spent less than 5 min to place the sample on the insert and to return the petri dish inside the incubator. LumiCycleAt the end, put your samples in a photon-counting luminometer as the LumiCycle. You will need to be in dim red light and in low intensity to avoid the light (mostly green-yellow light) altering sensitive photomultipliers inside. The LumiCycle 32, as its name says, allows you to have 32 samples inside. You can turn on them at once or at several times.We usually record our sample 3 times in one hour by setting 112 sec of recording per sample.After 7 days, you will need to change your medium if you want to keep the sample on recording.Note: It depends on your sample (the size, its consumption of luciferin…) and your experiment schedule. You need to check your sample oscillations and change them when they are low. CleaningTo make sure that no bacteria or fungi will grow in medium used for dissection or culture, we add 10x bleach into it until the liquid becomes clear before throwing away.Place all the forceps used and the brain matrix in the cleaning solution for 20 min minimum.",
    "They need to be fully dipped or at least the part that was in contact with the tissues. Wash the equipment under tap water and dry them. Be careful the solution is toxic; therefore, do not discard it in the sink.Note: We usually let the tools in the cleaning solution overnight. Avoid bleach as it will harm your equipment.Clean the fume hood (horizontal flow) and all the equipment inside (stereo microscope, lamp) with 70% EtOH."
