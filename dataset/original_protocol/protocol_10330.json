    "NOTE: Crambe seeds (cultivar Galactica) were supplied by the Plant Research International, Wageningen, Netherlands. Oil was extracted from the seeds by the method of Appelqvist13. Both the crambe meal and the wheat gluten were stored at -18 °C until further use.\n1. Dough Preparation\nSieving crambe\nSieve the crambe meal with a round, fine-mesh stainless steel kitchen sieve (pore size: ~1.5 mm, 14 mesh), to remove large fiber fractions and uncrushed seeds. Store the sieved meal at -18 °C to prevent material ageing.\nMilling crambe\nTo reduce the particle size and make the material more homogeneous, mill the sieved crambe meal in a rotary ball mill.\nMill 250 g of crambe meal each time in a 7 L jar with 21-25 mm diameter ceramic balls using a 53 rpm jar revolution rate and a milling time of 24 hr.\nConditioning\nBefore further processing, condition all the ball-milled crambe meal and wheat gluten powder in open jars for a minimum of 48 hr at 23 °C and a relative humidity of 50% in a climate-controlled room.\nMixing the components\nGrind the urea powder (stored in a closed beaker at ambient conditions) to fine particles with a mortar and pestle.\nBlend urea and glycerol (25.5 g of glycerol and 15 g of urea per 100 g of the final mixture).\n\t\t\nHeat the glycerol to 65 °C in a glass flask in an oil bath and add the urea powder slowly.\nStir the mixture with a magnetic stirrer at 65 °C until the urea powder is completely dissolved.\nMixing the crambe and wheat gluten",
    "Blend the crambe meal powder and wheat gluten powder in a kitchen mixing machine for 5 min. For example, for a 60/40 (w/w) crambe/wheat gluten ratio, use 35.7 g of crambe meal and 23.8 g of wheat gluten per 100 g of the final mixture.\nMixing glycerol/urea with crambe/wheat gluten\nSlowly add the glycerol/urea mixture to the crambe/wheat gluten blend in the kitchen mixing machine while stirring the mixture. Continue mixing for approximately 2 min, until a homogeneous dough is obtained. Prepare 500 g of the mixture each time.\nFor the material with 60/40 (w/w) crambe and wheat gluten, use the following relative contents of the respective constituents: 35.7 g of crambe meal, 23.8 g of wheat gluten, 25.5 g of glycerol, and 15 g of urea (per 100 g). For the other two material combinations (i.e., 70/30 and 80/20), change only the crambe and wheat gluten contents. Keep the glycerol and urea contents the same as in the 60/40 combination.\n2. Film Extrusion\nLow-temperature profile\nPerform the film extrusion in a twin-screw extruder. Set zones 1-10 (each 80 mm-long) along the extruder barrel at a low temperature profile (subsequently called \"low-T profile\"), as follows: 75-75-75-80-80-80-80-85-85-85 °C. This prevents the wheat gluten from crosslinking in the barrel.\nUse a flat sheet die (45 mm x 0.7 mm) to extrude the films.\nChoose a screw speed between 30 rpm and 200 rpm and record the die pressure.\nFeed the dough manually through the hopper with the help of a wooden pusher to support the material flow towards the screws.\nAt the die, pick up the extrudate with a conveyor belt operating at a speed of 2.0 m/min. Place air ventilation cooling (fans) along the belt.",
    "Run different die temperatures (105 °C-(105 °C), 110 °C-(110 °C), 125 °C-(115 °C), 130 °C-(120 °C), and 140 °C-(125 °C)) to select the conditions that give the smoothest extrudate with a minimum amount of voids.\n\t\tNOTE: The values in the brackets correspond to the temperature in zone 11, next to the die. It is adjusted to reach the target temperature in the die.\nAfter extrusion, store the extrudates in sealed polyethylene bags until further processing or analysis in order to prevent ageing and atmospheric water absorption.\nFilm extrusion using the high-temperature profile\nExtrude films as described in section 2.1, but use a high-temperature profile (subsequently called \"high-T profile\"), as follows: 85-85-85-100-100-100-110-110-120-120-120 °C for zones 1 to 11 of the extruder.\nUse die temperatures of 125 °C and 130 °C.\nFilm extrusion after pelletization\nIn order to get pellets, extrude the material as continuous strands in the extruder using a two-strand die.\n\t\t\nUse the low-T profile for the extruder barrel, as described above, and a 60-rpm screw rotational speed.\nUse different die-(zone 11) temperatures (130 °C-(125°C), 125 °C-(115 °C), 105 °C-(100 °C), and 85 °C-(85 °C)) to obtain the strands with the smoothest surfaces.\nPelletization\n\t\t\nAfter passing the conveyor belt (the belt situated after the extruder that helps to feed material out of the extruder), feed the strands into a pelletizer operated with a cutting speed of 7 m/min.\nFilm extrusion from the pellets\n\t\t\nFeed the pellets manually into the extruder and extrude films with the low-T profile inside the barrel and with a 125 °C-(115 °C) flat-sheet die temperature. Use a screw rotational speed of 30 rpm.\nFilm extrusion using volumetric feeding\nIn order to simulate automatic feeding (commonly used in industry), use the pellets previously extruded at 85 °C (steps 2.3.1-2.3.2.1).",
    "Connect the feeder to the extruder and choose the volumetric feeder mode of the hopper.\nUse a feeding volume of 35 kg/h and hopper and extruder screw speeds of 16 and 120 rpm, respectively.\nExtrude with the low temperature profile of the barrel and use a die-(zone 11) temperature of 125 °C-(115 °C).\n3. Post-extrusion Process (Compression Molding)\nPressing with the frame\nFor the first setup, cut two extrudates into pieces of 4.4 cm x 7.0 cm and 2.6 cm x 7.0 cm.\n\t\tNOTE: This is needed because the frame is broader than the extrudates.\nPlace them next to each other in an aluminum rectangular frame (70 x 70 x 0.5 mm3).\nSandwich the frame between two aluminum plates using poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) films on both sides to prevent adhesion, and then place them into the press.\nSet the pressure gauge on the press to 200 or 400 bar.\nFor each molding pressure, press the films with a plate temperature of 110, 120, and 130 °C for 10 and 20 min.\nAs a reference to the pre-extruded samples, press films from unextruded material. Center 7.2 g of fresh material (from section 1.6) in the aluminum frame.\nPress with the same parameter settings as for the pre-extruded films above (steps 3.1.4- 3.1.5).\nPressing without a frame\nCut out and sandwich rectangular samples (4.4 cm x 4.4 cm) between two aluminum plates using PET films on both sides to prevent adhesion.\nPlace them into the press. Set the pressure gauge to 50 bar, 75 bar, or 100 bar.\nFor each molding pressure, press films for 5 or 10 min using 110 °C, 120 °C and 130 °C plate temperatures."
