    "1. Design of microarray\nNOTE: DNA probes represent custom 36-nucleotide sequences, consisting of the recognition site for T7 DNA primase (GTC) located between two variable flanking regions, followed by a constant 24-nucleotide sequence tethered to a glass slide3. We used a 4 x 180,000 microarray format, which enabled spotting of each DNA sequence in six replicates, randomly distributed on the slide.\nDesign of DNA library for primases with known recognition sequences \nEnsure that each sequence is composed of 60 nucleotides. Keep the first 24 nucleotides constant (to be attached to the glass slide). Variable regions should have the following general form: (N)16GTC(N)17; where N represents any desired nucleotide.\nDesign the flanking region to address a specific scientific question (an example of the design is presented in the following text). The flanking regions may be designed to contain specific features such as the repeat elements or specific symmetry.\n\t\tNOTE: We have created eight categories of different flanking sequences composed of two or three specific nucleotides: T and G (group 1); T and C (group 2); C and A (group 3); A and G (group 4); G, C and T (group 5); C, T and A (group 6); G, A and T (group 7); G, A and C (group 8). 2,000 different sequences were designed for each group. Each group had subgroups of sequences with different types and different numbers of sequence repeats.\nInclude a set of negative control sequences (lacking the specific binding site)4. The presence of such sequences allows to validate the occurrence of specific binding in the experiment.\nDesign of DNA library for primases with unknown recognition sequences \nIf the recognition sequence is unknown, create the DNA library by selecting the sequences (with or without specific features mentioned previously) from the genome of desired organism (bacteria, fungi, etc.).",
    "Design of microarray slide \nPurchase custom slides (e.g., 4x180K, AMADID #78366) from a commercial supplier (for more details see Table of Materials). Order each sequence in six replicates, where each replicate should be attached to a randomly selected spot on the slide.\n2. Primase DNA binding experiment\nNOTE: The day before (or at least 2 h before) the PBM, prepare the blocking solution [2% w/v skim milk in phosphate buffer saline (PBS)] and stir it on a magnetic stirrer. Prior to use, filter the solution with a 0.45 µM filter. To detect the primase binding to the DNA strands, several steps should be performed in the following order.\nBlocking procedure \nPre-wet the microarray slide in a Coplin jar with 0.01% v/v Triton X-100 in PBS (5 min at 125 rpm on a lab rotator).\nBriefly wash the gasket slide (also referred to as coverslip) with water and ethanol and dry using compressed air.\nAssemble bottom part of steel hybridization chamber (PBM chamber) with the gasket slide facing up (commercial label facing up). For more details regarding the assembly, refer to the Table of Materials.\nPipet blocking solution (2% w/v skim milk in PBS) into each chamber.\nRemove the microarray slide from the Coplin jar, then dry the non-DNA side (the DNA should be on the same side as the company label) and edges using a fine wipe. Slowly place the microarray on the gasket slide, avoiding bubbles (company label facing down). Immediately assemble and tighten steel hybridization chamber apparatus. Incubate for 1 h at room temperature (RT).\nFill one staining dish (the “PBS” dish) with 800 mL of fresh PBS. Fill a second staining dish (the “WASH” dish) with 800 mL of freshly prepared 0.5% v/v Tween-20 in PBS.",
    "Unscrew the PBM chamber and remove the microarray slide-coverslip “sandwich”, taking care not to break the seal. Disassemble it underwater in the WASH dish by placing forceps between the slide and coverslip.\nShake the microarray slide underwater and quickly transfer to a Coplin jar.\nWash once with 0.1% v/v Tween-20 in PBS (5 min at 125 rpm on a lab rotator).\nWash once with 0.01% v/v Triton X-100 in PBS (2 min at 125 rpm on a lab rotator).\nQuickly transfer the slide to a Coplin jar containing PBS.\nProtein binding \nAssemble the PBM chamber as previously described (steps 2.1.2–2.1.3).\nPipette protein binding mixture containing 5 µM T7 DNA primase, 30 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 6.5 mM MgCl2, 30 mM K-glutamate, 6 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 65 μM ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTP), 2% w/v skim milk, 100 ng/μL bovine serum albumin (BSA), 50 ng/μL salmon testes DNA, and 0.02% v/v Triton X-100 (TX-100) into each chamber of the gasket slide (without touching the rubber sides and without introducing bubbles).\nRinse the microarray slide briefly by dipping it in the PBS dish, which removes excess detergent from the surface of the slides. Wipe the non-DNA surfaces of the slide with a fine wipe.\nSlowly lower the microarray slide (facing down) onto gasket slide, being careful to prevent leakage from one chamber to another. Immediately assemble and tighten PBM chamber apparatus without introducing bubbles. If bubbles do form, they can be removed by gently tapping the steel chamber against a hard surface.\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature (RT).\nFluorescent antibody attachment\nUnscrew the PBM chamber and remove the microarray slide-coverslip “sandwich”, taking care not to break the seal. Disassemble underwater in the WASH dish using forceps. Shake the slide underwater and quickly transfer to a Coplin jar containing PBS.",
    "Assemble the PBM chamber with gasket slide as previously described (steps 2.1.2–2.1.3).\nAdd Alexa 488-conjugated anti-his antibody (10 ng/μL in binding buffer) to the gasket slide.\nRinse the slide briefly by dipping it in PBS dish as before, then remove the slide from PBS slowly, wipe the non-DNA surface and place it facing down onto gasket slide.\nIncubate 30 min at RT in the dark (fluorescence probe is light- sensitive) to reduce photo-bleaching.\nDisassemble the PBM chamber and coverslip as before, removing the coverslip underwater in the WASH dish.\nRinse the slides briefly by dipping them in the PBS dish. Dry the slides with compressed air. Store in the dark in a slide box until ready to scan.\nScanning the microarray slide \nScan the chip by using microarray scanner (refer to Table of Materials) with excitation of 495 nm and emission of 519 nm and collect the median fluorescence intensity.\n3. Microarray data analysis\nNOTE: All data processing was performed using custom written scripts in MATLAB.\nPerform the initial PBM data processing using Wilcoxon rank sum test p-value as described previously4.\nUse the median value of the binding intensity for each DNA sequence for further analysis.\nNext, using the one-way ANOVA p-values, compare statistical significance of the observed differences in primase-DNA binding intensities obtained for different groups of DNA probes, as explained above in the DNA library design section3.\n4. Template-directed RNA synthesis catalyzed by T7 DNA primase\nPreparation of denaturing polyacrylamide gel\n\t\nTo prepare 100 mL of gel mixture, combine 62.5 mL of 40% acrylamide-bisacrylamide (19:1), 42 g of urea, 1.1 g of Tris base (2-Amino-2-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-propanediol), 0.55 g of boric acid, and 0.4 mL of 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution.",
    "Divide the mixture into 14 mL aliquots (the amount needed for one gel of 16.5 cm x 26 cm x 0.03 cm) and keep them protected from light at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nTo prepare one denaturing polyacrylamide gel, add 4 µL of TEMED and 40 µL of 10% w/v ammonium persulfate to 14 mL of the previously prepared mixture, cast it, and leave it to polymerize for at least 2 h at RT. The gel can be kept for one day at 4 °C.\nSample preparation\n\tNOTE: Keep the reagents, reaction mixture, and samples on ice.\n\t\nTo prepare the reaction mixture required for ten reactions combine 11 µL of 5x activity buffer (200 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 7.5; 50 mM dithiothreitol, 250 mM potassium glutamate, 50 mM MgCl2), 5.5 µL of 2.5 mM mixture of nucleotide tri-phosphate (NTPs), and 5.5 µL of radiolabeled ribonucleotide [e.g., ATP, (α-32P) 3000 Ci/mmol].\n\t\tNOTE: All amounts have been increased by 10% due to possible pipetting errors. Radiolabeled ribonucleotides should be diluted according to the strength of radioactive signal (initial dilution is usually 1:10 or more).\nTransfer 2 µL of the reaction mixture to ten PCR tubes.\nAdd 1 µL of 100 µM DNA template to the corresponding PCR tube and spin down.\nAdd 2 µL of 16 µM T7 DNA primase, spin down, mix gently, and spin down again.\nIncubate the reaction at RT for 20 min.\nStop the reaction by adding 5 µL of quenching solution (95% formamide, 20 mM EDTA, 0.05% w/v xylene cyanol and bromophenol blue), mix, and spin down.\nSeparation of RNA products by electrophoresis through denaturing polyacrylamide gel and subsequent signal detection\n\t\nPre-run the gel for 1 h (10 mA, 600 V) in 1x TBE buffer (90 mM Tris-borate, 2 mM EDTA).",
    "Load up to 2 µL of each sample and perform electrophoresis (20 mA, 1100 V) in 1x TBE buffer (90 mM Tris-borate, 2 mM EDTA).\nDry the gel for 2 h at 80 °C under a vacuum.\nExpose the phosphor imaging plate to radioactive gel for a few hours to overnight, depending on the strength of radioactive signal.\nRecord the signal (photostimulated luminescence) by using phosphorimager (see Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required.
