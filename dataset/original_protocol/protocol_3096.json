    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nInjection of SB Plasmids into the Fourth Ventricle of Neonatal Mice\nTiming: 1–1.30 h/10 mice\nThis protocol is adapted from Mendez et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] and has been used by our laboratory to generate reproducible models of brainstem high-grade glioma. This non-viral method induces tumors in situ via Sleeping Beauty transposase mediated integration of plasmid DNA into the host genome (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). To generate high-grade brainstem glioma, plasmids encoding DNA transposons, encoding the SB transposase and luciferase, fluorescently labeled oncogenic drivers and genes of interest are injected into the fourth ventricle of post-natal day 1 pups (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). The resulting tumors exhibit the salient features of brainstem high-grade gliomas.\nLoad syringe with 10 μL of plasmid DNA/Jet-PEI solution prepared previously.\nAnesthetize first pup prior to plasmid injection by hypothermia. Wrap the pup in gauze and place it on ice for 2 min. Anesthesia will continue on the cooled stereotaxic frame throughout the procedure.\nCritical: Maintain the temperature of the frame above freezing (2°C–8°C) to prevent burn injury to the pups. Use Parafilm to prevent direct contact of the pups with the metallic frame.\nPlace pup on pre-cooled stereotaxic stage and immobilize head using the gauze covered ear bars.\nCritical: Ensure the pup’s head is secured by the ear bars and is parallel to the surface of the stage.\nDisinfect injection surface by wiping the pup’s head with 70% ethanol.\nLower the needle to injection surface and adjust the stereotaxic coordinates to target the fourth ventricle (3 mm posterior to the lambda suture; Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nLower needle further until a dimple has formed on the skin and record the coordinates.",
    "Lower the needle to a depth of 4 mm, and then raise the needle 1 mm to get to a depth of 3 mm below the skull.\nInject 0.75 μL plasmid solution using the automatic injection at a rate of 0.5 μL/min.\nAfter the injection is completed, leave needle in place for 1 min.\nSlowly raise the needle from the skull.\nRemove the pup from the stereotaxic frame, and place it under a heating lamp. Monitor pup’s recovery to ensure normal breathing, mobility, and rosy color have returned (5–7 min). Gentle lung massage and limb stimulation can be performed to aid in the recovery.\nCritical: To ensure pup survival, it is important to limit the length of time between anesthesia and post-injection warm up. If the time between hypothermia and heating lamp less than 10 min, survival of the pups is typically 100%.\nRepeat steps above to proceed with remaining injections.\nReturn pups to mother’s cage and monitor her response for 30 min to ensure nurturing behavior resumes.\nCritical: The mother is typically accepting of the pups after the injection procedure. However, a surrogate mother can be added to the cage if feeding behavior does not resume.\nReturn cage to vivarium.\nCritical: The plasmid encoding for the SB transposase (pT2/SB100x-Luc) also harbors a transposon that mediates Luciferase gene genomic integration. Once integrated into the host’s genome (24 h post injection) the expression of the Luciferase enzyme allows for tumor monitoring by bioluminescent imaging (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D) (Calinescu et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Koschmann et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Nunez et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Mendez et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Frequently, for a successful injection procedure, we detect luciferase signal on >80% of the injected mice after 24 h post injection.\nMonitor plasmid uptake in pups using an IVIS bioluminescence imaging system (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).",
    "Remove pups from the mother’s cage 24–48 h after injection. Anesthetize pups prior to imaging by hypothermia. Wrap the pups in gauze and place them on ice for 2 min. After this, place pups individually into wells of a sterile 6-well tissue culture plate.\nUse a 1 mL syringe with a 30-gauge hypodermic needle to subcutaneously inject 10 μL of luciferin (30 mg/mL) between pup’s shoulder blades. Pinch and lift the skin gently prior to injection to prevent penetration of organs.\nWait for 5 min to allow for luciferin to penetrate the brain.\nImage pups immediately on IVIS bioluminescence imaging system (IVIS Spectrum settings: automatic exposure, large binning, aperture f = 1).\nCritical: Plasmid uptake must be verified no later than 24 h post injection, as the process relies on the detection of transient expression. The transient expression decreases after 24 h, and the growth of fur on the head of the pups makes it more difficult to detect the luciferase expression at time points later than 24 h post injection.\nMonitor tumor formation and progression using IVIS bioluminescence imaging system. According to the model and the genetic lesions incorporated, tumors will appear between 2 months and 4 months post injection of the plasmids (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nPlace animals in chamber with flowing oxygen and isoflurane (1.5%–2.5% isoflurane, with an oxygen flow of 1.5 L/min [LPM]) to anesthetize.\nRemove mouse from chamber and use a 1 mL syringe with a 26-gauge needle to intra-peritoneally inject 100 μL of luciferin (30 mg/mL in PBS or saline). Set a timer for 5 min. Up to five animals may be injected at a time.\nPlace animal back into anesthesia chamber for 3–4 min.\nInitiate flow of oxygen and isoflurane (1.5%–2.5% isoflurane, with an oxygen flow of 0.25 LPM) to the bioluminescence chamber.",
    "Position animals into imaging slots and glass nose cones in the bioluminescence chamber.\nWhen the timer sounds, obtain a series of six images at 2-min intervals (IVIS Spectrum settings: automatic exposure, median binning, open aperture f = 1).\nFor each animal imaged, define the area of interest (placing the oval over the head) and measure the intensity of luminescence using the calibrated units (photons/s/cm2/sr) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nGeneration of Primary Neurospheres from Brainstem High-Grade Glioma\nTiming: 1 h\nSleeping beauty induced tumors can be harvested and used to generate stable primary cell cultures that harbor the key mutations of high-grade brainstem glioma. These tumor neurospheres (NS) represent a valuable model of high-grade brainstem glioma and facilitate the study of the biology of brainstem tumors in vitro and in vivo (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nMonitor tumor bearing animals for signs of tumor burden.\nCritical: The specific genetic alterations delivered to the brainstem will determine the length of time before animals display neurological deficits as a symptom of tumor burden. For SB induces brainstem tumors symptoms of morbidity include hunched posture, impaired mobility, scruffy fur, as well as ataxia and seizures.\nEuthanize tumor bearing mice by transcardial perfusion with Tyrode’s solution supplemented with Heparin (15 Units/L).\nCritical: Given their location, brainstem tumors can be relatively small at the time mice demonstrate significant signs of tumor burden. It is important to preserve as much tumor tissue as possible when generating NS cultures; therefore, be extremely careful and precise when dissecting to preserve the tumor tissue.\nDecapitate mouse and gently dissect brain from skull.\nPlace brain in sterile Petri dish resting on damp ice.\nVisualize tumor using fluorescent dissecting stereo microscope (e.g., Olympus SZX16) at the appropriate wavelength for fluorescent markers used in SB plasmid mixture.\nUse a scalpel to isolate fluorescent tumor from surrounding tissue.",
    "Transfer tumor into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 300 μL of neural stem cell media.\nUse plastic pestle to dissociate mechanically the tumor tissue.\nAdd 10 mL of neural stem cell media to the dissociated tumor suspension and filter it through 70 μm strainer.\nCentrifuge at 2,000 × g for 2 min. Wash pellet twice with 1 mL of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (without Ca2+ or Mg2+), resuspending by pipetting and centrifuging at 2,000 × g for 2 min in each wash.\nIncubate tumor suspension with 1 mL of pre-warmed (37°C) Accutase. Incubate for 2–3 min at 37°C.\nAdd 10 mL of DPBS to the cells suspension and centrifuge cells at 2,000 × g for 2 min. Discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL of NS complete media. After resuspension, add NS complete media (supplemented with EGF and FGF to final concentration of 20 ng/mL) to a final volume of 10 mL. Plate cells in a T25 flask and culture at 37°C, 5% CO2 in neural stem cell media. For the first 2 weeks, centrifuge the neurospheres (500 × g, 2 min), resuspend with 10 mL NS media supplemented with growth factors to a final concentration of 20 ng/mL (FGF and EGF) and replate to a new T25 flask twice a week.\nMonitor cells for formation of neurospheres. Once visible, collect spheres (discard freely floating single cells or cells adhering to flask), passage, and replate.\nSize of flask will depend on volume of cells recovered at this time.\nIf neurospheres are small or not forming readily, change media and replace growth factors as needed until well formed spheres appear.",
    "Maintain cells in culture. Passage and expand cells as needed when flasks contain neurospheres and media becomes orange/yellow. Use cells for implantation and other experiments at a passage below 10, since over-passaging can lead to accumulation of genetic rearrangements.\nOrthotopic Implantation of Glioma Neurospheres to Generate Brainstem High-Grade Glioma\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nNeurospheres from the SB tumors can be implanted orthotopically to generate a 100% penetrant and reproducible model of brainstem high-grade glioma located in the correct anatomical location (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). This is important because the brain has unique components including the blood-brain barrier, cellular microenvironment, and tissue/organ architecture.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/287-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Stereotaxic Implantation Coordinates and Results\n(A) Left: overhead view of the surgical area for orthotopic implantation. Image shows the incision held open with retractors, revealing the top of the skull with visible suture lines. The square highlights the lambda, and the red dot marks the injection sight. Right: enhanced view of the injection region. Diagram illustrates X (1.0 mm), Y (1.0 mm), and Z (4.5 mm) coordinates for neurosphere implantation.\n(B) Immunohistochemical analysis of a sagittal mouse brain section at the experimental endpoint. The tumor was generated by stereotaxically implanting SB-derived DIPG neurospheres in the brainstem of a mouse following the orthotopic implantation protocol. Positive Ki67 staining shows the tumor located in the brainstem.\nTake a 70%–90% confluent T-75 flask of neurospheres and transfer to a 15 mL conical tube with a serological pipet. Centrifuge at 350 × g for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL of pre-warmed (37°C) Accutase. incubate for 2–3 min at 37°C.\nCritical: Make sure neurospheres are properly dissociated by gently pipetting the solution post incubation, leave cells at 37°C longer if not dissociated. Additionally, cells can be filtered through a 70 μm strainer to discard cell clumps.",
    "Add 9 mL of PBS and centrifuge at 1,500 rpm (∼350 × g) for 5 min to wash cells.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend in 100 μL PBS.\nCritical: For higher implantation concentrations, it may be necessary to resuspend in a smaller volume.\nCount cells and dilute to the proper concentration with PBS in a 0.6 mL Eppendorf tube for implantation (e.g., 30,000 cells/μL if implanting 30,000 cells). Maximum injection volume is 5 μL. Keep cells on ice (4°C).\nCritical: Higher concentrations increase the likelihood of clogging the injection needle. Limit to a concentration of 50,000 cells/μL.\nTo maximize reproducibility, mice implanted should be 6–8 weeks of age. Anesthetize mouse.\nIntraperitoneally inject mouse with mixture of ketamine (120 mg/kg) and dexmedetomidine (0.5 mg/kg), dissolved in sodium chloride 0.9% solution\nWait until animal is properly sedated.\nCritical: When sedated, mouse should not be responsive to pain stimuli (e.g., foot pinch) and breathing should slow down. Sedation parameters should be checked throughout surgery. Ketamine can be re-dosed if necessary, using half the original dose. It should not be mixed with dexmedetomidine.\nShave top of head with animal hair clippers.\nInject each mouse intraperitoneally with carprofen (5 mg/kg) dissolved in sodium chloride 0.9% solution.\nPlace mouse on stereotaxic frame.\nSet mouse on platform with heat support (should be set to around 37°C).\nOpen mouth with forceps.\nPlace mouth over the bite bar, making sure front teeth go through hole on bar and pull tongue to the side.\nPress ear bars lightly against side of head and adjust so they have the same reading. After adjusting, they should be similar lengths and be pressing with enough pressure to stabilize head.\nTighten nose clamp (Not too hard, until you feel some resistance).",
    "With a cotton swab, apply iodine to the top of head and wipe off. Repeat three times, after the last application wait 5 min before wiping off.\nMake 0.25 cm incision on top of skull with scalpel.\nUsing forceps, carefully pull back skin from incision and insert retractors.\nCritical: Make sure that skull is in the correct orientation. To do this move needle along the sagittal and coronal sutures (raised slightly above the skull surface so it does not touch it). The needle movement should be aligned (in parallel) with the sagittal and coronal suture lines, and maintaining the same distance to them along its movement.\nLocate the lambda coordinate and move the needle slightly above this location. Lambda can be visualized easier if the skin is slightly dry and by pressing down lightly on top of skull near the suture.\nFrom the lambda coordinate, move the needle 1 mm posterior and 1 mm lateral to the target site (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nMark the location with a tuberculin syringe equipped with a 26-gauge needle by gently scraping the periosteum.\nRaise Hamilton syringe and drill through the skull using a #7 or #8 bit connected to a Dremel drill at marked location (1 mm posterior, 1 mm lateral from lambda). Drill until you reach the dura mater.\nCritical: When drilling, use gentle pressure and take breaks to make sure area does not get too hot.\nLoad the syringe with cell suspension.\nFlick or gently pipette tube with tumor cells to resuspend cells.\nDraw up cells (volume depends on concentration and number of cells to be injected).\nEject 1 μL of volume to ensure that there is no air in syringe and that cells can be dispensed properly.",
    "Critical: Prior to loading, flush injection syringe with PBS to ensure that it is not clogged and dispenses volume correctly. When loading cell suspension, make sure to draw more volume than needed (e.g., If injecting 1 μL, draw at least 3 μL into syringe). Maximum injection volume per mouse is 3 μL.\nLower the syringe to target site until tip barely touches the dura mater.\nLower the syringe 5 mm inferior to the dura mater.\nRaise syringe 0.5 mm (Should now be at 4.5 mm inferior to the dura mater) and wait 2 min.\nSlowly deliver the cells at a rate of 1 μL/min.\nWait 5 min, and then slowly retract the syringe from the brain.\nCritical: Be patient when retracting the syringe. Removing it too quickly can cause injected cells to come out.\nEject the remaining volume in the syringe into a tube containing 10% bleach solution and flush needle twice by fully loading it with PBS, and then twice with ultrapure sterile water.\nCritical: It is important to flush syringe quickly after removal to make sure it does not clog between injections, especially when using higher cell concentrations.\nWash the injection site three times with sterile PBS.\nRemove the mouse from stereotaxic frame by loosening nose clamp and ear bars. Then, gently remove the mouth from the bite bar with forceps.\nClose incision with 4-0 sutures.\nPerform subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg) followed by intraperitoneal injection of atipamezole (1 mg/kg).\nPlace the animal in fresh cage with heat support and monitor until full recovery."
