    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGeneration of transient transgenic larvae for SypHy expression in neurons\nTiming: 6 h\nThis section describes the generation of zebrafish larvae with mosaic expression of the exocytosis indicator SypHy in neurons for the detection of synaptic vesicle release in the motor neuron presynapse.\nPrepare an injection solution of 3–13 pg/nL plasmid DNA (mnx1:SypHy-p2a-mRFP) in deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease-free water.\nBackfill 10 μL of plasmid solution into embryo injection needle.\nInsert the injection needle into a glass pipette holder clamped onto a micromanipulator.\nFor the first use of a plasmid, prepare injection solution with multiple plasmid concentrations to identify the optimal plasmid concentration.\nNote: The optimal concentration yields a sufficient percentage of expressing cells in the larvae for efficient analysis.\nExamine the injected larvae under a fluorescent stereo microscope to visualize transgene expression for identifying optimal plasmid concentration.\nNote: Once the optimal dose is identified, use this injection amount for all experiments to ensure expression consistency. Excess amount of plasmid introduced to the embryo can be lethal.\nUsing forceps, break the tip of the injection needle to create a tip opening diameter of around 20–25 μm, preferably with a beveled tip to effectively penetrate the chorion and embryo.\nCalibrate droplet diameter to 120 μm for a 1 nL volume by suspending in mineral oil on micron slide (Drerup and Nechiporuk, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nCollect zebrafish embryos within 20 min of spawning.\nMicroinject into single cell of zebrafish zygotes at the one cell stage.\nNote: Zebrafish zygotes may be stabilized in a 1.5% agarose plate within troughs formed by a plastic mold (Adaptive Science Tools).\nIncubate embryos in petri dishes filled with E3 embryo media at 50–100 embryos per dish in an incubator set to 28.5°C.\nAt 3–4 h post-fertilization, remove any unfertilized or abnormal embryos.",
    "Continue to remove abnormal or dead embryos at least every other day starting at 1 dpf.\nGeneration of stable transgenic lines for G-GECO expression in neurons\nTiming: 6 months\nThis section describes the generation of a novel zebrafish transgenic line with neuronal expression of the calcium indicator G-GECO. Completion of this section generates zebrafish larvae expressing G-GECO in all neurons for the detection of calcium flux in the motor neuron presynapse.\nNote: Instead of generating a new transgenic line, adults or embryos may be requested from laboratories maintaining the Tg(5kbneurod:G-GECO)nl19 transgenic line.\nPrepare an injection solution of 7 pg/nL of pDestTol2CG2-5kbneuroD:G-GECO plasmid DNA along with 100 pg/nL Tol2 transposase mRNA in deoxyribonuclease and ribonuclease-free water.\nBackfill plasmid solution into embryo injection needle.\nInsert the injection needle into a glass pipette holder clamped onto a micromanipulator.\nNote: Tol2 transposase mRNA is synthesized using an mMessage Machine SP6 kit (ThermoFisher catalog# AM1340). Store Tol2 transposase RNA in single use aliquots at −80°C to avoid freeze-thaw cycles.\nCalibrate droplet diameter to 120 μm for a 1 nL volume suspended in mineral oil over micron slide.\nCollect zebrafish embryos within 20 min of spawning.\nMicroinject into zebrafish zygotes at the one cell stage.\nScreen injected embryos (F0) at 2–4 dpf for G-GECO expression in neurons of interest.\nNote: Transgenesis will occur in a subset of the injected embryos and these embryos will show mosaic transgene expression.\nRaise G-GECO expressing F0 embryos to reproductive maturity.\nOutcross F0 transgenic zebrafish with wild type and screen the progeny embryos (F1) for transgene expression in neurons of interest.\nNote: Since F0 zebrafish are mosaic for the transgene, a variable subset of their offspring will be heterozygous for the transgene.\nRaise G-GECO expressing F1 embryos to reproductive maturity.\nOutcross heterozygous F1 zebrafish to create heterozygous F2 zebrafish.",
    "Identify lines with a single transgenic insertion event by assessing larvae for transgene expression on a fluorescent stereo microscope.\nNote: Mendelian inheritance with visually similar levels of transgene expression is indicative of single integration of the transgene. These F2 heterozygote zebrafish and their offspring can be used as stable transgenic larvae for calcium imaging experiments.\nImage acquisition: Spontaneous motor neuron synaptic activity\nTiming: 4–8 h\nThis section describes the imaging of spontaneous motor neuron synaptic vesicle release in the absence of stimuli using the fluorescent exocytosis indicator SypHy. Completion of this section will generate imaging data for measuring the rate of spontaneous motor neuron synaptic activity.\nRaise zygotes injected with plasmid DNA encoding mnx1:SypHy-p2a-mRFP to 4 dpf.\nSort larvae for expression of the mRFP reporter in the cell body of spinal motor neurons of the ventral spinal cord on a fluorescent stereo microscope.\nBecause the objective recommended in this protocol for imaging has a limited working distance, make sure to group sorted larvae based on whether neurons expressing fluorescent reporters are on the left or right side of the larvae by placing each group in a separate dish containing E3 embryo media.\nNote: This step is to ensure that the side of the larva containing the motor neuron of interest will be mounted facing the objective.\nMelt low melt agarose in water near boiling temperature and incubate in 42°C water bath to equilibrate.\nUsing vacuum grease, secure new coverslip to the top of the punched petri dish lid.\nAnesthetize larvae in fresh E3 embryo media with 0.02% tricaine (0.4% tricaine diluted 1/20 in E3) and mount the larvae.\nWash larvae briefly in fresh embryo media to remove the tricaine.\nIndividually mount larvae in 1.8% low-melt agarose (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).",
    "Use glass pipette to individually dispense larvae suspended in minimal volume of E3 into agarose.\nPipette the larvae, now suspended in agarose solution, onto coverslip mounted on 35 mm punched petri dish lid.\nWhile the agarose is fluid, gently press the side of the larva with the expressing neuron onto the coverslip.\nNote: Minimize the gap between the surface of the larva and coverslip using a fine embryo manipulator. The larva should lie on one side with the right and left eyes and horizontal myosepta appearing directly on top of one another when viewed from above. Embed the larvae in agarose within 1 min following the removal of tricaine before the anesthetic effect is lost.\nCritical: High percentage agarose is essential here to eliminate movement as larvae are no longer in anesthetic during imaging. A gap between the larva and the coverslip will significantly degrade signal intensity.\nOnce agarose has solidified (∼1–2 min), submerge the solidified low-melt agarose in embryo media by placing the lid on the 35 mm petri dish bottom filled to the brim with embryo media (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nWrap edge with parafilm to avoid spillage.\nIdentify a motor neuron axon terminal of interest.\nUnder brightfield or phase contrast illumination on a confocal microscope, identify the ventral spinal cord with a 10× objective.\nAdd water for immersion to the coverslip.\nWith a 63× (NA1.2) water immersion objective, identify the cell body of the targeted motor neuron using the cytosolic mRFP and trace its axon through the trunk to a terminal on the surface of the trunk, near the horizontal myoseptum (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2079-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(A) Schematic of the trunk cross-section showing the position of the notochord (nc), spinal cord (sc), and the primary motor neuron axons which extend from the spinal cord. Green rectangle on the horizontal myoseptum (hm, purple dotted line) represents the area and depth at which SypHy and mRFP signal are acquired from motor neuron axon to measure spontaneous motor neuron synaptic vesicle release.\n(B) A representative image of an axon terminal of a motor neuron expressing SypHy (B′; green) and mRFP (B″; magenta). Scale bar = 5 μm.\n(C) Over time, spontaneous synaptic vesicle release may be visualized within the motor neuron axon by increases in SypHy fluorescence intensity, indicated with a heatmap overlay.\nAfter identifying a motor neuron axon terminal of interest, adjust the focal planes for a z-stack of the region.\nCapture the mRFP and SypHy signal using 561 nm and 488 nm excitation lasers in an optimized z-resolution stack every 10 s for a total duration of 5 min, yielding 30 image stacks (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C–C‴, Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nNote: We suggest that images be taken with optimal image parameters for best resolution dependent upon your confocal system. For the typical point-scanning confocal microscope, sequential imaging without averaging is ideal to allow sufficient temporal resolution while minimizing potential cross-talk by co-excitation between channels.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Representative video of SypHy signal intensity change (left) and heatmap overlay (right) after 20-s (2 frame) temporal binning, related to steps 37–38 in “Data analysis of spontaneous synaptic activity (SypHy) in motor neuron axon terminals using FIJI/ImageJ”\nAxon terminal shown. Scale bar = 5 μm.\nRepeat for at least 10 animals for each group, subject to power analysis, to record spikes in SypHy signal indicative of spontaneous synaptic vesicle release.",
    "Critical: Keep all microscope settings (laser power, detector sensitivity and offset, etc) consistent between larvae imaged for the experiment.\nNote: Because transient transgenesis generates reporter-expressing neurons in unpredictable locations, we select the CaP neuronal fiber that falls within the depth of the trunk denoted by the green box in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A. While the protocol presented here is used to analyze spontaneous motor neuron synaptic activity using SypHy, protocols described for stimulation-evoked motor neuron synaptic activity could be implemented to analyze evoked synaptic vesicle release (refer to G-GECO protocol below).\nOptional: To augment synaptic vesicle release, spontaneous release frequency can be increased through incubation in 100 mM N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). Previous work has shown NMDA treatment increased spontaneous motor neurons synaptic activity in fictive swimming behavior (Cui et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; McDearmid and Drapeau, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]; Todd et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36]). Our previous work has shown that the effects of NMDA treatment on motor neuron is reflected in transient increases of motor neuron synapse SypHy fluorescence intensity (Mandal et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]). This manipulation is valuable for questions regarding synaptic vesicle recycling or recruitment, which are required for sustained synaptic vesicle release.\nOptional: To remove background SypHy fluorescence intensity resulting from exocytosis before the start of image acquisition, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) may be used by photobleaching the imaging area immediately prior to imaging in step 22. This procedure should be taken if the experiment involves the acute (e.g., pharmacological) rescue of exocytosis. In conditions where endocytosis is reduced, measurements of exocytosis using SypHy should also utilize FRAP. As an example, see (Koudelka et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nImage acquisition: Evoked motor neuron synaptic activity with fluid jet stimulation\nTiming: 8 h",
    "This section describes the imaging of evoked motor neuron synaptic calcium influx at the neuromuscular junction. Synaptic activity is evoked by stimulating the tail with a fluid jet. Completion of this section will generate imaging data for measuring the kinetics of calcium influx during synaptic activity at the motor neuron presynapse.\nNote: This embryo mounting, and imaging method may also be used for live imaging of spontaneous activity.\nAnesthetize larvae in fresh E3 embryo media with 0.02% tricaine (0.4% tricaine diluted 1/20 in E3) and mount the larvae.\nAfter movement ceases, position 4 dpf G-GECO expressing larva near the surface of a droplet of 1.8% low-melt agarose lying on one side, similar to the orientation described in step 19 above.\nUse fine forceps (#5 or #55) to cut two shallow lines parallel to each side of the tail (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2079-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. In order to produce evoked motor neuron synaptic activity, the tail of the zebrafish larva is freed from agarose to deliver tactile stimulation\n(A) In preparation for stimulation, the tail is first freed from the agarose by cutting around the tail (A) and lifting the agarose free of the tail using #5 or #55 fine forceps (A′).\n(B) Heart injection needle is used to deliver the paralytic α-bungarotoxin, which replaces tricaine, a sodium channel blocker. α-bungarotoxin eliminates muscle movement but does not alter neuronal activity. The heart injection needle must puncture through the low-melt agarose and enter the cardiac chamber from the ventral side of the zebrafish.\nCut the agarose beneath the tail and lift the agarose that is bounded by the 3 cuts until it breaks off and slides off the tail (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]Aʹ). The caudal fin and some of the peduncle should be exposed.",
    "Submerge the larva in embryo media with 0.02% tricaine in order to immobilize the larva for heart injection.\nLoad needle with α-bungarotoxin for heart injection.\nBackfill heart injection needle with 3 μL α-bungarotoxin colored with phenol red used to visually confirm injection.\nInsert the heart injection needle to a pipette holder clamped to a micromanipulator next to a stereo microscope.\nConnect the pipette holder to a pressure injector with the following suggested settings: Pinjection = 100 hPa, tinjection = 0.5 s, and Pcompensation = 5 hPa.\nPosition the pipette holder to point down ∼30° from the horizontal and position the immobilized larvae such that the DV axis is parallel to the heart injection needle with the heart facing the needle.\nOn the stereo microscope, use the heart injection needle to penetrate the low-melt agarose and into the cardiac cavity.\nInject one pulse into the cardiac cavity using the recommended pressure injector setting (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). The cavity should distend slightly from the additional volume.\nRinse the paralyzed larva with 3 washes of embryo media to remove tricaine. Do not let the larva dry out during the rinses.\nCritical: Make sure the heart does not stop beating or significantly slow down. If the heartbeat is impacted, prepare a new larva.\nPlace the larvae under the objective of a confocal microscope with stimulation capability.\nTo prepare the fluid-jet needle for use in stimulation, backfill the fluid-jet needle with embryo media for fluid-jet stimulation.\nCreate a wider opening for the fluid-jet needle by scoring the tip of the needle perpendicularly against a ceramic tile to break the tip such that the inner diameter of the opening is between 35 and 50 μm.\nCritical: Ensure that the break is even across the tip for well-directed flow.",
    "Under phase contrast with a 10× objective of the confocal, position the fluid jet near the tail.\nAdjust the pressure output and visually confirm that the tail and tail fin are deflected without shifting the body of the larva (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nSet the back pressure such that the fluid jet pipette is not deflecting the tail at rest. Visually confirm by moving the pipette away from and back toward the tail; the tail should not move.\nLocate somite 4, which may be identified by counting the chevron-shaped body segments that span the dorsal-ventral axis of the trunk (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2079-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Zebrafish motor neurons with evoked presynaptic calcium influx\n(A) Motor neuron axon calcium activity is recorded in the body segments 4–9, which are represented in this schematic as white chevrons. Starting from segment 4, a superficial area (green), dorsal to the horizontal myoseptum (hm, purple dotted line), but ventral to the spinal cord (sc), is imaged for G-GECO signal for evoked motor neuron axon calcium activity.\n(B) In order to specify the region of interest (ROI) from which G-GECO fluorescence intensity is measured, an arbitrary straight line is drawn across the width of the imaged motor neuron axon. The signal intensity measured across the line is used to determine the half-max intensity (B′), which is used as the lower threshold limit (yellow outline) to define the pixels included in the measurement (red, B″). Scale bar = 5 μm.\n(C) Evoked synaptic calcium activity may be visualized within the motor neuron axon immediately following the delivery of a tail stimulation, represented by increases in G-GECO intensity indicated with a heatmap overlay.",

Baseline intensity (F0) is taken from the average of the 2-s (black bar) prior to stimulation delivery (gray bar).\n(E) Two example traces of motor neuron axon G-GECO signal showing signal intensity increase immediately following stimulation onset (gray bar). Black trace is taken from the example show in (B-C‴). Pre-stimulation baseline intensity, peak intensity, and time-to-baseline can vary between axons.\nTrace the motor neuron axon from the spinal cord until a superficially located bulbous axon terminal dorsal to the horizontal myoseptum but slightly ventral to the spinal cord is identified.\nSwitch to a 60× (NA 1.0) dipping objective and identify an imaging plane of interest.\nTest the fluid-jet pressure to ensure that the imaging plane does not move out of focus during the application of fluid-jet stimulation.\nCritical: Movements which changes the focal plane (shifting in the Z axis) cannot be corrected post-acquisition with registration procedures. Minor shift in the imaging field of view (shifting in the X or Y axis) may be corrected by registration post-acquisition but should be minimized.\nCapture the G-GECO signal at the single focal plane using a 488 nm excitation laser every 50 ms for a total duration of 10 s, yielding 200 images.\nSet the fluid jet to deliver a 50 ms pulse of fluid at 5 s (or 100 frames) after commencing image acquisition (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C–C‴, Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nCollect at least 12 measurements for each group.\nCritical: Multiple stimulation attempts should be separated by a 2 min rest period.",
    "Note: Consistently selecting the area and tissue depth for imaging CaP axon in the G-GECO stable transgenic line improves signal consistency (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A). Even so, tail stimulation sometimes does not generate discernible G-GECO fluorescent intensity increase. Imaging trials with G-GECO intensity change <150% above the range of observed baseline fluorescence intensity (signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5×) may be discarded. In our experience, we have had difficulty identifying evoked G-GECO signal below this signal-to-noise threshold.\nNote: Alternative protocol: Heart injection can be technically challenging. An alternative procedure to deliver α-bungarotoxin is to bathe the larvae in 50 μg to 1 mg/mL α-bungarotoxin in 0.5%–1% DMSO in E3 embryo media for ∼ 1 min (Randlett et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2.

Completion of this section will generate the relative rate of synaptic vesicle release at the motor neuron presynapse for comparison between groups.\nNote: Most file format generated by software driving confocal microscopes may be opened by FIJI/ImageJ with the Bio-formats plugin.",
    "In the FIJI tool bar, under “Analyze”, use the “Set Measurement” window to select Area and Mean gray value as measurement values to display for analysis.\nImport image sequence for analysis into FIJI.\nUnder “Image”, in “Stack”, use the “Z-project” function to generate sum-projected z-stacks of the axon terminal, excluding any focal planes above or below, through the time series.\nUsing the freehand tool, outline the axon terminal to be analyzed.\nMoving through the stack, record the mean fluorescence intensity for the SypHy and mRFP channels separately.\nTo determine the average spontaneous synaptic activity over the time series, calculate the average mean fluorescence intensity of SypHy normalized to the mean fluorescence intensity of mRFP across entire time series and compare between groups.\nData sets can be compared using an ANOVA if the data is parametric or Wilcoxon rank sums for nonparametric data.\nPower analyses (use alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.2) should be done to confirm adequate sampling.\nData analysis of evoked synaptic activity in motor neuron axon terminals using FIJI/ImageJ\nTiming: 2–5 h\nThis section describes the procedure to measure evoked synaptic activity indicated by the fluorescent signal from the calcium indicator G-GECO. Completion of this section will generate the kinetics of calcium influx at the motor neuron presynapse, from which the peak change can be extracted for comparison between groups.\nIn FIJI, install the Image Stabilizer plugin (Li, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). In the menu bar, under “Analyze”, select the “Set Measurement” window, and check boxes for “Area”, “Mean gray value”, and “Add to overlay”.\nImport acquired images with FIJI.\nUse the Image Stabilizer plugin to register X-Y movement artifacts.\nNote: See Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4] for a walkthrough of steps 42–46.",
    "To segment the frame for intensity measurement, go to frame 60, or 3 s after imaging began, and draw a line region of interest (ROI) using the Straight-Line tool across an arbitrary axis of the visible motor neuron and include some background on each end of the line (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nUnder “Analyze”, open the “Plot Profile” window to plot the intensity value across the line (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]Bʹ).\nCalculate the average between the maximum and minimum intensity values. This half-max value will be used as the minimum threshold value to segment the image into regions (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B″).\nUse the threshold tool to segment the image from the half-max to the maximum value.\nCreate an ROI around the area above the threshold using “Create selection” under “Edit”, in the “Selection” sub header.\nOpen the “Roi manager” window and add the newly created ROI.\nIn the “Roi manager”, use “Multi measure” to record the values for the mean intensity for each time point on a spreadsheet, and record the area measured for this time series.\nThe ROI Manager window will contain the region(s) measured. In the ROI Manager, save the ROI containing the axon of interest. The saved file will be written in the .roi file format.\nPlot the change in intensity over baseline.\nThe baseline intensity (F0) for each time series is generated by getting the average of the 2 s before stimulation (frame 60–99, Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D and 6E).\nCalculate the change in intensity over baseline by subtracting fluorescence measurement (F) of each frame by F0, and then divide this value by F0 ((F-F0)/ F0).\nFrom the change in intensity over baseline, collect the maximum value after stimulation onset for each time series.\nPerform the appropriate statistical analysis on the peak change in intensity.",
    "The distribution of peak change in intensity per experiment group is expected to approach Normal. If this holds true and variability between groups is consistent, data sets can be compared using ANOVA.\nCritical: If the distribution is non-normal, use Mann-Whitney U test for two sample tests or Kruskal-Wallis for multiple comparisons.\nWhile sample sizes are typically 12 measurements per group, perform power analyses following collection to confirm adequate sampling.\nNote: Currently, the amount of change in calcium activity necessary to represent physiological changes in presynaptic function is not known. It is therefore important to consider any reported differences in motor neuron presynaptic calcium activity in the context of changes in overall motor neuron function and behavioral output.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S4.
