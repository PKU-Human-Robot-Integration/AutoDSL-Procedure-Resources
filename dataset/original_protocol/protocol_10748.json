    "1. Microtubule Gliding Assay Stock Solutions\nPrepare ahead of gliding assay.\nPolymerize 0.5 mg microtubules sparsely labeled  with bright organic fluorophore 22.  The target label concentration is 1 fluorophore per micrometer of  microtubule, or a labeling density of approximately 1 fluorophore per 1,500  tubulin dimers. Store at room  temperature, light protected with aluminum, foil for up to two weeks.\nPurify biotin-kinesin21 at approximately 1 μM. Store  at -80  °C in 5 μl aliquots for use in individual experiments.\nPrepare the assay buffer (AB) of 50 mM  imidiazole, 50 mM potassium chloride (KCl), 4 mM magnesium chloride (MgCl2),  2 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), pH 6.7. Sterile filter and store at 4 °C.\nDissolve biotinylated bovine serum albumin  (biotin-BSA) to 2 mg/ml in AB. Filter  with 0.2 μm syringe filter. Store at -80  °C in 100 μl aliquots for long periods, at 4  °C for up to one month. \nDissolve streptavidin (SA) to 10 mg/ml in AB. Filter with 0.2 μm syringe filter. Store at -80  °C in 20 μl aliquots for long periods, at 4  °C for up to two weeks.\nDissolve α-casein to 5 mg/ml in AB. Filter with 0.2 μm syringe filter. Store at -80  °C in 100 μl aliquots for long periods, at 4  °C for up to two weeks.\nDissolve dithiothreitol (DTT) in deionized water  at 200 mM. Store at -20  °C in 100 μl aliquots, use within 8 hr of thawing. Can be refrozen.\nDissolve paclitaxel (PT) in HPLC-grade dimethyl  sulfoxide (DMSO) at 4 mM. Store in 10 μl aliquots at -80  °C long term, -20  °C short-term. Use within 8 hours  of thawing. Can be refrozen.\nDissolve glucose in deionized water at 120  mg/ml. Store in 100 μl aliquots at -20  °C. Can be refrozen.",
    "Dissolve adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in  deionized water at 150 mM, pH 7.0. Store  in 5 μl aliquots at -80 °C, use within 8 hr of thawing.\nPrepare 100x oxygen scavenging stock25 by dissolving 10,000 units glucose oxidase and 156,000 units catalase  into 600 μl total assay buffer. Centrifuge  briefly in a microcentrifuge to pellet solids; filter supernatant with 0.2 μm syringe filter. Store at -80  °C in 10 μl aliquots for long periods, at 4  °C for up to one week.\n2. Microtubule Gliding Assay, Same Day Solution Preparation\nPrepare the solutions in 2.1-2.6 on the day of the experiment.  With practice, solutions 2.2-2.6 can be prepared during flow-cell washing.  Unless otherwise noted, keep stock solutions on ice.\nPrepare AB, 1 ml of assay buffer with 10 μl of DTT stock (AB with 2 mM DTT).  Keep at room temperature.\nPrepare bio-BSA buffer, 40 μl of a 1:1 mixture of the biotin-BSA stock and AB. Keep at room temperature.\nPrepare BSA buffer, mixing 645 μl of AB with 5.5 μl BSA (1 mg/ml BSA in AB). Keep  at room temperature.\nPrepare SA buffer, mixing 57 μl of AB with 3 μl streptavidin stock (0.5 mg/ml streptavidin in AB). Keep at room temperature.\nPrepare α-casein buffer, mixing 200 μl of BSA buffer, 50 μl casein stock, and 0.8 μl of 15 μM ATP (1 mg/ml α-casein, 0.8 mg/ml BSA, 50 nM ATP in AB). Keep at room temperature.",
    "Prepare fluorescence anti-bleach buffer, mixing  95 μl α-casein buffer, 2.5 μl glucose stock, 1 μl 100x oxygen scavenging mix, 1 μl paclitaxel stock, 1 μl 2-mercaptoethanol (βME). Add βME under fume hood. Use  fluorescence anti-bleach buffer within 1 hr of preparation. CAUTION: βME is highly toxic and smells awful. Be sure to only open under the fume  hood. Store bottle in the absence of  light; light degrades βME and its ability to reduce photobleaching.\n3. Microtubule Gliding Assay\nConstruct about four flow lanes between a 24 x 60 mm coverslip and 22 x 22 mm coverslip using vacuum grease, extruded  from a syringe through a pipette tip, as a spacer. Each flow lane should be approximately 10 μl in volume (scale subsequent volumes accordingly).\nWash 10 μl of bio-BSA buffer into each lane. Incubate 5 min to allow BSA to coat the  glass surfaces.\nWash each lane three times with 15 μl BSA buffer to remove free biotin-BSA, while continuing to block the  slide surface. Use a Kimwipe or filter  paper to remove buffer from opposite side of flow chamber, being sure not to allow air bubbles to go through the flow chamber.\nWash 15 μl SA-buffer into each lane. Wait 10 min, or up to 2 hr. The streptavidin will bind to the  surface-bound biotin-BSA.\nWash each lane three times with 15 μl BSA buffer to remove free SA while continuing to block the slide  surface. \nWash each lane with 15 μl α-casein buffer. α-casein helps further block non-specific binding of kinesin and  microtubules to the glass.",
    "Dilute kinesin to 10 nM in α-casein buffer and wash each lane with 15 μl of this kinesin - α-casein solution. Wait 15 min (or up to an hour) for the biotinylated kinesin to bind specifically to the  surface-bound streptavidin. The kinesin  motor domains will remain free to bind microtubules.\nDilute paclitaxel to 40 μM in room-temperature α-casein buffer, and wash each lane with 15 μl of this solution to wash out free kinesin and to pre-load each flow  chamber with a paclitaxel solution to prevent microtubules from depolymerizing. Cold also depolymerizes microtubules, so make  sure these steps occur at room temperature with room temperature solutions.\nDilute fluorescently labeled microtubules  1:100-1:1,000 in fluorescence anti-bleach buffer with 1 mM ATP. Wash 15 μl into one lane and observe within 30 min.\n4. Data Collection\nObserve the microtubules gliding using  fluorescence microscopy; a microscope capable of resolving single fluorophores  such as a commercial or home-build TIRF setup is required26 (Figure 2).\nThe microtubules should be propelled by the  kinesin motors over the substrate at approximately 0.5 μm/s, depending on temperature. If  the field-of-view of the microscope is 50 μm, individual microtubules should be visible for approximately 100 sec. Set illumination intensity so that single fluorophores do not photobleach more quickly than 100 sec. If using laser excitation, a power  setting of approximately 3-5 mW is appropriate.\n  \nCollect sequences of images for analysis. 600 images at 5 Hz (2 min total) works  well. Use sequences long enough that  microtubules traverse the entire field-of-view.\n5. Data Analysis\nAn IDL routine, get_lp.pro[href=http://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/50117/50117IDL_Routines.zip], is attached. This  routine returns a persistence length value based on all microtubules gliding in  a given image sequence. Either run this  routine on each image sequence, modifying intensity parameters depending on  your particular microscope setup, or do the following:",
    "Track each fluorophore attached to a microtubule  to create fluorophore trajectories.\nCombine all the trajectories of fluorophores on  a given microtubule into an overall microtubule trajectory; repeat for each  microtubule in the image sequence (Figure 3).\nCalculate the tangent angle to each point along  the trajectory (Figure 4), and calculate <cosθs> in Eq. 1 by averaging the cosine of the angle  difference for every pair of points separated by a path-length s (Figure 5).  Find the persistence length for a single  microtubule or group of microtubules by fitting <cosθs> to Eq. 1,  weighting the individual data points in the fit by the number of independent  values of cosθs that are used  to compute the average.\nSubscription Required.
