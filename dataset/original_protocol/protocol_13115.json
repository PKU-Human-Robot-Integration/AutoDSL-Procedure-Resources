    "1. Sample preparation\nCape gooseberries\n\t\nPlace 100-200 g of fresh fruits in a blender vase. Keep at 4 °C for 30 min, and then homogenize in a laboratory blender.\nImmediately, transfer the juice to 50 mL plastic tubes, freeze them in liquid nitrogen and lyophilize to dryness for 4 to 5 days.\nGrind the lyophilized material to a fine powder using an electric grinder.\n\t\tNOTE: Handling of the dry material needs to be done quickly because the powder is highly hygroscopic.\nWeigh 1 g of the ground material and add 10 mL of ultrapure water. Vortex for 1 min.\nSonicate for 20 min at 10 °C, and then centrifuge at 23,000 × g for 20 min at 10 °C.\nRecover the supernatant and filter it through a 13 mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) 0.45 µm syringe filter.\nLyophilize 1 mL of the filtered extract to dryness and then re-suspend the obtained solid in 0.9 mL of 200 mM sodium oxalate buffer pH 4. Vortex.\nLyophilize the resulting sample to dryness and dissolve it in 0.9 mL of deuterium oxide containing 5 mM of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt (TMSP-d4).\nFill the NMR tube with 0.6 mL of the sample using a micropipette.\nVanilla leaves\n\t\nCollect the leaves, clean them with damp tissue paper and freeze them whole in liquid nitrogen.\nBreak the leaves into small pieces and lyophilize for 4 days until dryness.\nGrind the dry matter to a fine powder using an electric grinder.\nWeigh 50 mg of ground material and add 0.75 mL phosphate buffer pH 6.0 in deuterium oxide containing 0.1% of TMSP (w/w) and 0.75 mL methanol-d4. Vortex for 1 min.\nSonicate for 20 min at 25 °C.\nCentrifuge at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 25 °C.",
    "Recover the supernatant (~1.3-1.4 mL) and filter it through a 13 mm PTFE 0.45 µm syringe filter.\nFill the NMR tube with 0.6 mL of the filtered sample using a micropipette.\nPotato tubers\n\t\nPeel and slice 4 to 8 tubers. Immediately, place approximately 125 g of material in stand-up bags and freeze them in liquid nitrogen.\n\t\t​NOTE: To avoid oxidation during handling keep the potato damp.\nLyophilize for 4 to 6 days until complete dryness.\nGrind the dry matter to a fine powder using an electric grinder.\nWeigh 160 mg of ground tuber and add 1.6 mL of deionized water. Vortex for 1 min.\nSonicate for 45 min at 10 °C.\nCentrifuge at 23,000 x g for 20 min at 10 °C.\nRecover the supernatant (~1.5 -1.6 mL) and evaporate it to dryness in a refrigerated centrifugal vacuum concentrator for 16 h, at 10 °C.\nAdd to the solid obtained (20-25 mg) 0.9 mL of 100 mM sodium oxalate buffer pH 4, vortex, and evaporate for 16 hours at 10 °C.\nDissolve the solid obtained in 0.9 mL of deuterium oxide containing 3 mM of TMSP.\nCentrifuge at 23,000 x g for 5 min at 10 °C and filter the supernatant directly into the NMR tube through a 13 mm PTFE 0.45 µm syringe filter.\n\t\t​NOTE: In this case, direct filtration into the NMR tube was performed to diminish steps in the preparation of more than 1000 samples.\n2. NMR Data Acquisition and Processing\nNMR initial setup\n\t\nTransfer the samples to the NMR spectrometer.\nTune and match the probehead.\nLock and shim the sample.\nCalibrate the 90° hard pulse. Calibrate the 90° pulse using any of the standard procedures.\nRun a standard 1D proton NMR spectrum.\nPSYCHE experiment",
    "Select the reset_psyche_1d pulse sequence from the Bruker Topspin library (Figure S1). Use the following standard parameters: 5 kHz spectral width (SW2), at least 1 or 2 seconds of relaxation recovery delay (D1), 16 dummy scans (DS), 64 or 128 complex data points per block (L31), and 64 or 128 scans (NS) (Figure S1).\n\t\tNOTE: L31 is the number of complex digital points acquired in each Pure Shift block, best to be set to a power of 2.21\nSet the desired CHIRP pulse flip angle excitation (CNST61) and 10 kHz for the CHIRP pulse bandwidth (CNST60) (Figure S2).\n\t\tNOTE: The PSYCHE experiment is based on an anti-z-COSY scheme; consequently the CHIRP pulse flip angle needs to be small to avoid recoupling artifacts (Figure 1). The absolute intensity increases with the excitation flip angle. The periodic artifacts are also enhanced, spreading into the spectrum and increasing the \"noise\" (Figure 1). The \"noise\" becomes a combination of standard noise and chuncking artifacts. A good compromise between sensitivity and low recoupling artifacts is to set CNST61 = 20°.19,22\nSet the hard pulse length (P1) to the previously calibrated value and the PSYCHE shape pulse length to 30 ms (P49) (Figure S2).\n\t\tNOTE: It is very important to calibrate the hard pulse value as the shape pulse powers will be automatically calculated from this value.\nChoose the Crp_psyche.20 (SPNAM 37) shape pulse for the PSYCHE element (Figure S2).\nSet the strength of the pulse field gradient applied during the PSYCHE element (GPZ0). Choose RECT.1 for the gradient shape pulse (GPNAM 0) (Figure S2).\n\t\tNOTE: A weak magnetic field gradient is applied during the PSYCHE element, normally, between 1% to 4% of the maximum strength of the gradient, depending on the probe.",
    "Set the number of blocks to acquire in order to reconstruct the Pure Shift FID (TD1) (Figure S3).\n\t\tNOTE: PSYCHE is acquired as a pseudo-2D experiment where TD1 is the number of Pure Shift interferogram blocks. The spectrum resolution depends on the size of the spectral window (SW1) and the total number of acquired points, which is TD1*2*L31. Typically, 16 or 32 blocks with 64 or 128 complex points per block will provide enough digital resolution. As PSYCHE is recorded in an interferogram manner, a higher number of blocks increase the digital resolution, but, also the total acquisition time19. Homonuclear J-couplings evolve during each block resulting in an oscillating J modulation pattern21,23. After Fourier transform, this generates periodic sideband artifacts that depend on the length of the block (Figure 2). To reduce artifacts, the duration of the block must be short, typically less than 16 ms (block duration = 2*in0: Figure S1). If the block duration is high, reduce L31.\nProcess the data with Bruker's Proc_reset AU program and Fourier transform.\n\t\tNOTE: We recommend to transform the spectrum using zero filling and a sine bell apodization (Figure S4).\nSAPPHIRE-PSYCHE experiment\n\t\nSelect the SAPPHIRE-PSYCHE pulse sequence and set the pulse sequence parameters. Standard parameters would be the following: 5 kHz spectral width (SW3), at least 1 or 2 seconds of relaxation delay (D1), 16 dummy scans (DS), 8 or 16 scans per increment (NS) and D2 to 14 ms (Figure S5).\n\t\tNOTE: This sequence is not in Bruker's repertoire, however, the sequence and the processing programs may be obtained from the Manchester NMR Methodology Group website, (https://www.nmr.chemistry.manchester.ac.uk/?q=node/426)23. The D2 delay ensures that T2 relaxation remains constant with each J modulation increment. D2 needs to be greater than 1/4*SW1+p16+2*d16.23",
    "Set the desired CHIRP pulse flip angle excitation (CNST20) and 10 kHz for the CHIRP pulse bandwidth (CNST21) (Figure S6).\n\t\tNOTE: As in the regular PSYCHE experiment, the CHIRP pulse flip angle needs to be short to avoid recoupling artifacts. CNST20 = 20° is a good compromise between sensitivity and low recoupling artifacts21,23,25.\nSet the hard pulse length (P1) to the previously calibrated value and the PSYCHE shape pulse length to 30 ms (P40) (Figure S6).\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to calibrate the hard pulse value as the shape pulse powers will be automatically calculated from it.\nChoose the PSYCHE_Saltire_10kHz_30m shape pulse for the PSYCHE element (Figure S6).\nSet the strength of the pulse field gradient applied during the PSYCHE element (GPZ10). Choose RECT.1 for the gradient shape pulse (GPNAM 10) (Figure S7).\n\t\tNOTE: A weak magnetic field gradient is applied during the PSYCHE element, normally, between 1% and 4% of the maximum strength of the gradient, value that depends on the probe.\nSet the number of SAPPHIRE J modulation increments in F2 (TD2) (Figure S7).\n\t\tNOTE: normally 8 increments ensure an excellent suppression of sideband artifacts (Figure 2 and 3). The total number of scans of the final Pure Shift FID is NS*TD2.23\nSet the F1 and F2 spectral windows (SW1 and SW2) (Figure S5).",
    "NOTE: SW2=SW3/(2*TD2) and SW3/SW1 = TD2*N, were TD2 and N are even integers23. The SAPPHIRE-PSYCHE experiment is acquired as a pseudo 3D where F2 encodes the J-coupling artifact phase modulation and F1 the Pure Shift interferogram acquisition20. Since SAPPHIRE-PSYCHE removes J modulation sidebands, the interferogram Pure Shift block duration could be longer than regular PSYCHE (Pure Shift block duration = 1/SW1), typically between 20 to 40 ms (Figure 2). However, longer chunk data acquisition leads to higher J-coupling evolutions, which would require more J-coupling phase modulation increments to remove the stronger sidebands attained23.\nSet the number of Pure Shift blocks (TD1) (Figure S7).\n\t\tNOTE: Since SAPPHIRE-PSYCHE needs to compensate the J-coupling phase modulation of the first block, an extra block needs to be acquired. Typically, 17 (16+1) or 33 (32+1) blocks give enough digital resolution23.\nProcess the data executing the pm_pshift and the pm_fidadd AU programs followed by Fourier transform23.\n\t\tNOTE: We recommend to transform the spectrum using zero filling and a sine bell apodization (Figure S4).\nSubscription Required.
