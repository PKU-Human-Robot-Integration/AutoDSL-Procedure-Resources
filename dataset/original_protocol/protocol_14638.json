    "This protocol meets and follows the guidelines set by the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Micro-dissecting a Mouse Prostate\nEuthanize the mouse by carbon dioxide asphyxiation or an alternative approved method in accordance with institutional animal care and use guidelines.\nPin the mouse in a supine position to a dissection board by putting a pin through each of the four paws.\nSpray the abdomen with 70% ethanol.\nHold the skin of the lower abdomen with forceps, and use scissors to cut through the skin and peritoneum approximately 1 cm anterior to the opening of the penis, careful not to cut any organs.\nCut away the skin and peritoneum from the lower abdomen, up both sides of the abdomen to the rib cage, exposing the peritoneal cavity.\nIdentify the bladder and urogenital tract, and expose them by gently moving fat and other organs to the side.\nUsing forceps, grip the vas deferens at the base near the urethra, and tear it away.\nRepeat with the opposite vas deferens.\nUsing forceps, carefully grip the bladder and pull it up, while simultaneously using scissors to cut through the urethra below the bladder and ventral prostate (approximately 1 cm below the base of the bladder).\n\tNote: As the bladder is pulled up, the entire urogenital tract (containing bladder, a section of the urethra, all prostate lobes, and the seminal vesicles) will come with it. There may be some resistance.\nPlace the urogenital tract (UGT) into a 60-100 mm Petri dish containing approximately 5-10 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nPerform the remaining part of the protocol under a dissection microscope. Use two fine forceps, one in each hand. Hold the forceps \"like a pencil\" and rest the forearms on the bench top so as to steady them.",
    "Use fine forceps to position the UGT such that the bladder is on top, the urethra is pointed down, and the seminal vesicles are positioned on either side of the bladder.\nGrip the urethra with one forceps and carefully pull away fat with the other forceps without tearing away any prostate tissue. Note: Fat will appear \"shiny\" relative to the surrounding tissue.\nOnce the fat is removed, use forceps to tear the connective tissue between the two ventral lobes of the prostate and separate them.\nTo remove one of the ventral lobes, use one forceps to grip a single ventral lobe near the tip, and use the other forceps to grip that lobe at the base as close to the urethra as possible. While still gripping the base of the lobe, use the other forceps to grip the urethra. Pull the lobe away from the urethra with a firm, smooth motion. Make sure no prostate tissue remains attached to the urethra. Place the lobe into the appropriate medium, depending on the next experimental step.\n\t\nTo fix and paraffin-embed the sample for histological analysis, place the lobe in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) 8.\nPlace the lobe in freezing medium, such as OCT, for cryopreservation and sectioning 8.\nPlace the lobe in cold PBS for single cell isolation for culture or flow cytometry 9.\nRepeat step 1.15 with the other ventral lobe.\nTo remove one of the anterior lobes, use forceps to gently pull the lobe away from the seminal vesicle, making sure not to puncture the seminal vesicle. Once the lobe is independent of the seminal vesicle, remove it in the same fashion as the ventral lobe in step 1.15.\nRepeat step 1.17 with the other anterior lobe.\nFlip the remaining urogenital tract over such that the dorsal prostate is visible.",
    "To remove one of the dorsolateral lobes, use forceps to tear the connective tissue between the two dorsolateral lobes and also the connective tissue between the lobes and the posterior region of the seminal vesicles. Remove the lobe in a similar fashion as the ventral lobe in step 1.15.\nRepeat step 1.20 with the other dorsolateral lobe.\n2. Surgical Castration\nNote: This is a survival surgery, so asepsis, anesthesia, and pain management are important to the ethical and successful completion of this protocol. Follow all institutional animal care and use guidelines. Use an external heat source, such as a recirculating water blanket, during the surgical procedure to prevent hypothermia.  Do not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered. Autoclave all surgical instruments before use in surgery.\nOn a clean, sterile surface anesthetize the mouse using appropriate measures (e.g. 2% inhaled isoflurane) and position the mouse in a supine position. Note: Alternative anesthesia methods, such as ketamine, may also be used, depending on the approved animal protocol.\nCheck the mouse's reflexes by pinching the toes. If the mouse does not react, proceed to the next step. If it does react, wait 1-3 min and check again. Shave the surgical area with an electric razor.\nAseptically prepare the abdomen of the mouse using alternating scrubs of 70% ethanol and iodine or procedures recommended by the institutional veterinary staff or IACUC.\nUsing a sterile scalpel, make a 1 cm vertical incision through the skin in the midline of the lower abdomen, approximately 1.5 cm anterior to the penis.\nMake a small incision (<1 cm) through the peritoneum, careful not to cut any organs.",
    "Using sterile forceps, grip the cut edge of the peritoneum and lift it up gently so as to be able to see the peritoneal cavity beneath.\nUsing another sterile forceps, reach into the peritoneal cavity and grip either the left or right testicular fat pad, lateral to the bladder. Pull the fat pad through the opening in the peritoneum and skin until the testis comes out as well. Be careful not to injure any other tissues or organs during this step.\nUsing a cautery pen, cut through the fat pad that is holding the testis. Cut slowly through the testicular artery with the cautery pen Note: If the testicular artery is cut too fast, there may be too much bleeding and the mouse may have to be euthanized.\nOnce the fat pad and artery are cut, remove the testis and fat pad.\nRepeat steps 2.6-2.9 with the other testis. Note: An alternative method for removal of the testes is to surgically ligate the testicular artery, followed by cutting the vessel with scissors.\nSuture the peritoneum closed with absorbable suture.\nStaple the skin closed with surgical wound clips.\nAdminister an analgesic to manage pain, and place the mouse in a clean cage on a cage warmer for 5-10 min. Monitor the mouse for signs of pain or bleeding.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
