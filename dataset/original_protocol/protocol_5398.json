    "Between 11:00 AM and 1:00 PM five days before surgery, 0.2 ml of 200 μg/ml LHRHa solution (see Recipes) is injected into the intraperitoneal cavity of the female recipient rats to synchronize estrus.At noon one day prior to surgery the female recipient rats are mated with vasectomized males. The following morning females are checked for the presence of a vaginal copulation plug as proof of mating. Females with vaginal plugs are used in the procedure and negative females are placed back into the colony for two weeks before reuse.The surgeon should wear a clean lab coat, hair net and gloves. A disinfected area is prepared by wiping the base of the microscope with 70% ethanol and placement of a clean surface protector. Embryos to be transferred are produced and collected as previously described (Filipiak and Saunders, 2006) and are incubated in KSOM (see Recipes) at 37 °C up to 24 h before the transfer.Instruments are autoclaved before the first surgery and sterilized in between up to four additional surgeries. Between surgeries, wipe instruments with sterile saline then insert the tip of each instrument into a 250 °C bead sterilizer for 15 sec. Allow to cool a minimum of one minute on a sterile Kimwipe before use.Anesthesia is induced in the recipient rat typically within 3-5 min of placement in a chamber with 1.0-1.5 liters per minute (L/min) of 5% isoflurane with oxygen as a carrier gas. Anesthesia is maintained during surgery with 3% isoflurane by placement of the nose of the preanesthetized rat in a nose cone (Figure 1). A diaphragm can be created using a glove and rubber band and cutting a small hole to fit snugly around the nose of the anesthetized rat (see Notes).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170815/20170815024839_5222.jpgFigure 1.",
    "Anesthetized rat receiving isoflurane through tight fitting nose coneApply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes by squeezing a thin layer of ointment onto the eye without contaminating the tube by touching the eye directly. Separate subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg), carprofen (5 mg/kg) and 0.5 ml of ampicillin (100 mg/ml) also take place immediately prior to surgery. Surgical depth of anesthesia is ensured first by observation of a depressed respiratory rate, then by repeated absence of tail- or foot-pinch reflex.The lower back of the recipient rat is shaved above the left uterine horn, and placed on a sterile tissue on the stage of the microscope. The shaved area is blotted with iodine and wiped with 70% ethanol-soaked tissue to prepare the surgical field and remove excess hair particles caused by shaving (Figure 2). This is repeated twice.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170815/20170815024939_6294.jpgFigure 2. Rat fully prepared for surgery after shaving and sterilization. Incision location indicated by black line.A sterile drape is placed over the animal.A single incision about 1 cm in length in a dorsal to ventral direction is made in the skin using grip forceps and large scissors at the level of the last rib (Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170815/20170815025021_1671.jpgFigure 3. Initial incision through skin and subcutaneous fat. D: dorsal; V: ventral; SC: subcutaneous fat; BW: body wall.The body wall is picked up with fine forceps and a small incision is made with spring scissors (avoiding blood vessels) just over the left ovarian fat pad (Figure 4). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170815/20170815025106_8168.jpgFigure 4. Incision through body wall. D: dorsal; V: ventral; BW: body wall; OFP: ovarian fat pad.The ovarian fat pad is grasped with fine forceps, and the distal portion of the reproductive tract is gently retracted from the abdominal cavity.",
    "The fat pad is held in place by an attached micro clip with a sterile piece of tightly rolled tissue under the uterus (Figure 5). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170815/20170815025215_5711.jpgFigure 5. Externalized ovary and fat pad. D: dorsal; V: ventral; OFP: ovarian fat pad; OB: ovarian bursa; OV: oviduct; U: uterus.A minimally vascularized area of the ovarian bursa is manually torn with fine forceps, providing a route to the ostium of the oviduct (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170815/20170815025258_1440.jpgFigure 6. Location of minimally vascularized area of ovarian bursa. D: dorsal; V: ventral; OFP: ovarian fat pad; OB: ovarian bursa; OV: oviduct; U: uterus.1-2 drops of epinephrine (approximately 20 μl) are dripped onto the bursa from a syringe until bleeding ceases. This decreases the length of the surgery and expedites location of the ostium.The tip of the transfer mouth pipet is loaded with 15-20 embryos for implantation and inserted into the ostium of the oviduct after stabilization with fine forceps. The embryos are injected into the oviduct by gentle pressure through the pipette (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170815/20170815025335_8803.jpgFigure 7. Placement of embryos into the reproductive tract. D: dorsal; V: ventral; OFP: ovarian fat pad; OB: ovarian bursa; OV: oviduct; U: uterus; O: ostium.The reproductive tract is carefully replaced in the abdomen, and the abdomen is closed by 2 sutures in the body wall (Figure 8) followed by skin closure with 2 wound clips.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170815/20170815025410_2802.jpgFigure 8.

D: dorsal; V: ventral; SC: subcutaneous fat; BW: body wall.Following surgery, the recovering rat is placed inside a rat cage resting on a 37 °C warming plate until the animal is fully awake and upright, typically five to ten minutes (see Notes).The cage is returned to a cage rack in a rat room and provided subcutaneous injection 0.2 ml carprofen (5 mg/ml) after 24 h as post-surgical analgesia.",
    "Up to three females can be housed together.The rats are monitored daily to verify recovery from the procedure. Females are separated 20 days after the procedure to give birth in individual cages."
