In\n      Taxol-sensitive cells, Taxol suppresses MT dynamics during spindle\n      formation leading to delays in establishing MT-kinetochore attachments.\n      The populations of kinetochores within the cells that are unattached and\n      tensionless, or attached with low tension cause a delay in anaphase onset.\n    \nEstablishing a log phase culture\n        Inoculate 5 mL SC media (Synthetic Complete) with Taxol-sensitive yeast\n        strain (MGY 2150;\n        Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2938-Mmc1.pdf]).\n        \n            Grow this culture at 30°C for 12–24 h before using as a pre-culture\n            to inoculate larger cultures.\n          \n        Use the freshly saturated 5 mL culture to inoculate into a 30–50 mL\n        culture, also in SC media at 30°C, at a dilution that will be in log\n        phase with an OD600(0.15–0.4) the next morning.\n      \n        Pellet the cells by centrifugation (3,000 g for 3–5 min) once desired OD\n        is reached.\n      \nNote: If the culture is undergrown at this\n      point, let it continue growing until it reaches\n      an OD600(0.15–0.4). If culture is overgrown, it's best to\n      prepare another 5 mL starter culture and try again. A possibility is to\n      start multiple 30–50 mL cultures with different dilutions of inoculum to\n      ensure one is in the proper stage in the morning.\n    \nNote: If you plan to fix cells for scoring\n      anaphase onset via DAPI staining, put a bottle of 70% ethanol in the\n      freezer the night before the assay to ensure it is ice-cold for fixing\n      samples.

    "The Cdc20 release assay is used to measure the effect of attached\n      kinetochores with reduced tension on the timing of anaphase onset. To\n      generate a metaphase spindle with kinetochores that are attached to MTs\n      and under tension, the cells are arrested in metaphase via depletion of\n      CDC20, in the absence of MT poisons. Due to the fact\n      CDC20 is an activator of the Anaphase Promoting Complex (APC/C),\n      when it is depleted, cells cannot enter anaphase.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\n      The strain used in this assay (MGY1293) has endogenous CDC20 under\n      the control of a methionine-inducible promoter.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\n      When methionine is present in the media, Cdc20 levels will be depleted,\n      and the cells arrest in metaphase. Taxol is added once the culture is\n      arrested in metaphase (pMET3-Cdc20 depletion) where the spindles are fully\n      formed, and kinetochores have established bipolar MT attachments.

There is critical\n      information about the relative effectiveness of Taxol in plates, notes\n      about preparing the YPD for the Taxol plates, peptone brand and lots, and\n      the age of the Taxol plates, which can all be sources of variation in this\n      assay.\n    \nEstablishing a saturated culture for spotting\n        Inoculate a 5 mL culture (MGY1872, MGY1874, and MGY2104;\n        Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2938-Mmc1.pdf]) in YPD.\n        \nIncubate on a rotator/shaker overnight at 30°C.\n        Use this culture to inoculate 10 μL into 10 mL fresh YPD the next day.\n        \nIncubate on a rotator/shaker at 30°C for the next 48–72 h.\nNote: We chose to use saturated cultures\n      for spotting assays because some mutant cultures grow slower than control\n      cultures. To generate high density starting spots these cultures need\n      additional growth time and using 48–72 h cultures results in similar\n      culture densities.\n    \n        Spot fully grown cultures onto the Taxol-containing plates.\n        \n            If the control plate is not showing similar density between strains,\n            then standardize cultures to the same OD600 before serial\n            dilutions.",
    "Spotting the Taxol plates\n        Add 150–200 μL of each saturated culture to the top well in a 96-well\n        plate.\n      \n        Perform 10× serial dilutions to create the range of dilutions for\n        plating.\n        \n            To create each spot a multichannel pipette is used with 2–3 μL of\n            each 10× serial dilution.\n          \n            Alternatively, a multi-pinned spotter, or ‘frogger’ can be used to\n            transfer droplets from the 96-well plate onto the various test\n            plates.\n          \n        Incubate spotted plates at 24°C and monitor for differences in Taxol\n        sensitivity over the next 3–5 days.\n        \n            Be sure that any plates between different spotting assays that are\n            being compared have the same amount of growth time at identical\n            temperatures.\n          \nNote: It is possible that intermediate\n      concentrations of Taxol could result in levels of cell death that are\n      obvious in early stages of colony growth but become obscure in later days\n      when control colony growth slows and the inhibited strain colonies ‘catch\n      up’ in size.\n    \nNote: The spotting assay can be performed\n      at different temperatures, e.g., 30°C. However, we found that on control\n      plates, without drug, colony formation of bub1 mutant strains lags that of\n      strains harboring functional Bub1. This difference is less pronounced at\n      24°C, presumably due to increased time to complete spindle assembly.\n    \nImage the plates with an overhead bright light.\nRecord and analyze results."
