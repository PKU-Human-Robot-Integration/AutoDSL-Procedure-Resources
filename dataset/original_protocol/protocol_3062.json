To monitor labeling of endogenously expressed protein, skip the transfection steps 3–6, and 9. Below are step-by-step details for transfection and radioactive metabolic labeling optimized for HEK293T cells.\nSplit the cells a day before transfection into 6 cm dishes so that they reach 70% confluency on transfection day.\nNote: A 6-well plate format also works for HEK293T cells if the expression of the gene of interest is good.\nFor prenylation assays, incubate the cells in 4 mL DMEM containing 5% dialyzed serum and 15 μM lovastatin8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] for 2 h.\nNote: Skip this step for palmitoylation assays.\nCritical: Treatment with lovastatin (or compactin11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) inhibits HMG-CoA reductase to suppress production of endogenous unlabeled mevalonate from HMG-CoA, increasing the probability to incorporate H3-mevalonate label derivatives into intended target protein.\nThaw the plasmids and PEI Max at room temperature.\nPut optiMEM (100 μL/μg DNA) into 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes and add plasmids (1–5 μg/6 cm culture dish).\nCritical: The plasmid amounts depend on the expression levels for the genes of interest and should be optimized for dish formats used.\nAdd PEI Max at a ratio of 3:1 (ratio of PEI to DNA) and mix by flicking or alternatively brief careful vortexing.\nIncubate the tubes at room temperature for 10–15 min.\nFor prenylation labeling, add 2 mL of fresh DMEM containing 5% dialyzed serum, 400 μCi of concentrated H3-mevalonolactone (0.2 mCi/mL)11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] and 15 μM lovastatin to the 6 cm dishes.",
    "Note: For cost-effectiveness, we labeled the cells with 400 μCi of concentrated H3-mevalonolactone (0.2 mCi/mL) in minimum possible volume enough to cover the cells. Tritiated-labeling metabolites are rather costly reagents.\nNote: To distinguish between geranylgeranylation and farnesylaion use specific inhibitors (GGTi vs FTi) during labeling and/or use cell systems lacking specific prenyltransferase (GGTase 1/2/3 or FTase).\nFor palmitoylation labeling, change the medium of the 6 cm dishes to 2 mL of labeling medium (see materials and equipment for the composition) containing 0.2 mCi/mL of concentrated H3-palmitic acid.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nNote: The labeling medium composition varies depending on the cell line used for the assay.\nAdd the transfection mixture dropwise to cells. Mix well by back-and-forth dish shaking.\nIncubate the cells overnight at 37°C in the CO2 incubator.\nHarvesting, lysis, and immunoprecipitation\nTiming: 6–24 h\nIn these steps the cells are harvested, lysed, and the protein of interest is immunoprecipitated.\nNote: To immunoprecipitate endogenously expressed protein, use protein-specific antibodies in steps where FLAG-M2 antibody is used in this protocol.\nRemove the medium from the plates and dispose according to the liquid radioactivity disposal guidelines.\nAdd 1 mL PBS to the plates and scrape the cells.\nPipette up and down and transfer the cells in a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nWash the plate once with 1 mL PBS to recover residual cells.\nCombine the 1 mL wash with scraped cells in the same 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C to pellet down the cells.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL PBS.\nTransfer the mixture into a fresh 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at 4°C and aspirate the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 500 μL lysis buffer containing 1× PIC and incubate on ice for 30 min with intermittent vortexing (we used NP-40 based lysis buffer).\nSonicate the lysate for 3 min (pulse on: 10 s, pulse off: 10 s, and Amplitude: 30%) in Sonic Dismembrator with Cup Horn (Fisher Scientific, FB705).\nNote: All liquid washes should be disposed of according to the liquid radioactivity disposal guidelines. For sonication, it is better to use Cup Horn instead of a probe to avoid contamination of the probe, cross contamination between the samples, and loss of sample. Use cold distilled water in the Cup Horn to decrease sample degradation.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 21000 × g for 20 min and transfer the supernatants to separate 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nAliquot 10% of the samples as input in a separate 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd 4× sample buffer containing freshly added DTT (50 mM) to a final concentration of 1×.\nHeat at 70°C for 10 min.\nCool at room temperature.\nGive a short spin (full speed) in a tabletop centrifuge, and store at −20°C.\nWash rProtein G Agarose and M2-FLAG-Agarose Gel in lysis buffer without PIC 2–3 times, each time centrifuging at 350 × g for 3 min and aspirating the supernatant.\nResuspend the pelleted beads in lysis buffer as 50% mixture (1:1 mixing).\nNote: M2-FLAG- Agarose Gel can also be centrifuged at 5000 g for 30 s. M2 Agarose Gel is used for immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged proteins. In case of performing endogenous IPs for a target protein, specific antibodies can be used either conjugated to resin or rProteinA/G resin can be used after the primary incubation period to pull down the target immunocomplex.\nAliquot 40 μL of the washed rProtein G Agarose into fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.",
    "Note: For homogenous aliquoting of washed rProtein G Agarose and washed M2-FLAG resin, cut the front portion of a 200 μL pipette tip with clean scissors to make a wider bore.\nAdd labeled protein samples to microcentrifuge tubes containing aliquoted rProtein G Agarose and mix by flicking gently to preclear the samples.\nOptional: The lysates can be quantified by BCA or Bradford assay to add equal amounts of protein samples to rProtein G Agarose resin.\nNote: 1–5 μg/μL of protein concentration and a total of 1–3 mg of protein is optimal for an IP.\nRotate the samples for 1–2 h at 4°C (∼16 rpm).\nNote: Tube rotator with 1.5/2 mL rotator drum (Fisher Scientific) was used for rotating the samples.\nWhile the samples are preclearing, aliquot 40 μL of the washed M2-FLAG-Agarose Gel into fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nSpin the samples from step 25 at 350 × g for 3 min and add the supernatants into the microcentrifuge tubes containing aliquoted M2-FLAG-Agarose Gel. Mix by flicking gently.\nRotate samples for 1–16 h at 4°C (∼16 rpm).\nNote: (a) In this step, samples can be rotated between 1‒16 h depending on the expression levels of the target protein. As a rule of thumb, endogenous IPs may be carried out for longer periods than exogenously expressed tagged proteins. It is recommended to optimize this step for the target protein beforehand, preferably without radiolabeling. (b) If the antibody used to IP endogenous protein is not conjugated to resin, add 30–50 μL of washed rProtein A/G Agarose resin (50% mixture of resin and buffer) for additional 1–2 h before next step.\nSpin the samples and wash 3 times with lysis buffer (1 mL/wash) without PIC, each time centrifuging at 350 × g for 3 min and aspirating the supernatant.",
    "Note: All liquid washes should be disposed of according to the liquid radioactivity disposal guidelines.\nRemove the remaining supernatant with a 200 μL tip.\nAdd 20–30 μL of 2× sample buffer and denature at 98°C for 10 min. Cool the tubes at room temperature and spin for a short time at full speed. Samples can be stored at −20°C or −80°C before loading.\nOptional: The samples can alternatively be eluted with 3X-FLAG peptide in TBS (concentration of 3X-FLAG peptide and volumes used for elution should be optimized) and then reconstituted with the sample buffer.\nRunning and transfer to PVDF membrane\nTiming: 3 h\nRun the samples on BoltTM 4%–12% Bis-Tris Plus gel at 150 V for 50 min in an Invitrogen Mini Gel Tank. Include a calorimetric or radioactive molecular weight marker.\nNote: (a) As a routine lab practice, we usually run 5%–10% of the sample to confirm IPs and for normalization of baits among various samples by Western blotting (anti-FLAG) before proceeding to run final gels for the autoradiography. (b) In our protocols, we used gradient gels. BoltTM 4%–12% Bis-Tris Plus gels provide a wide range of resolution for sample targets, particularly for those with higher molecular weights, and the run times are shorter. Tris-glycine-based gels and manually casted gels were not used in our protocol, and if used, should be checked beforehand for the target protein.\nActivate the PVDF membrane by wetting it in methanol for a few seconds and equilibrating in the transfer buffer until it sinks.\nTransfer the samples at 20 V for 1 h in an InvitrogenTM Mini Gel Tank.\nNote: Our protocol SDS-PAGE run time, transfer voltage and time are optimized for BoltTM gradient gels with regards to protein of interest. The running and transfer conditions should be empirically optimized for manually cast gels.",
    "Stain the PVDF membrane with Ponceau S to confirm the proper transfer of proteins.\nWash the membrane with TBST (0.1% Tween-20).\nStain with Ponceau S until color develops.\nWash with distilled water to remove the background.\nDe-stain with TBST.\nWash with PBS/TBS once before next step.\nAir dry the PVDF membrane on filter paper, carefully monitoring the orientation of top vs. bottom sides.\nPVDF exposure to phosphor screen and detection using phosphor imager\nTiming: ∼2 weeks\nCover the PVDF membrane with the phosphor screen in a cassette.\nUse low adhesion tape to keep the phosphor screen in place.\nClose the cassette tightly.\nPlace the cassette at room temperature in dark to expose the phosphor screen for 2–3 weeks.\nNote: Phosphor screens are rather expensive reagents. Accordingly, portions of the phosphor screen, enough to cover the PVDF membrane, should be cut with clean scissors to minimize costs.\nAlternatives: Kodak BioMax MS film for autoradiography can be used instead of phosphor screen. In this case, exposure is done at −80°C which increases the sensitivity of the film.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nRemove the phosphor screen from the cassette and detect the H3 signal in a phosphor imager.\nNote: 2–3 weeks of exposure are generally sufficient to detect the signal.\nTake a colorimetric image of the PVDF membrane if using a colorimetric molecular weight marker.\nNote: Markers on PVDF are used to correctly align and locate the positions of the bands in the autoradiograph.\nProcess the same PVDF membrane for Western blotting.\nBlock the PVDF membrane in 5% nonfat dry milk.\nImmunoblot for the transfected target protein with rabbit anti-FLAG antibody.\nNote: Alternatively, Western blotting can also be done prior to exposure to the phosphor screen. Moreover, portions of the samples can be used for Western blotting (see Note (a) in step 32)."
