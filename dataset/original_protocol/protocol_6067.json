    "Protein extractionPlace freshly prepared leaf discs (10-50 mg) punched-out with a cork borer in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and immediately freeze in liquid nitrogen in a Dewar’s vessel. The estimated average weight of five leaf discs should be approximately 10 mg. Grind the sample in the microcentrifuge tube with a homogenizer pestle and add 200 µl of the ice-cold protein extraction buffer (prepare immediately prior to use, Recipe 1) per 50 mg sample on ice before sample lysis. Note: Make sure not to dissolve the sample. We recommend grinding the sample in the presence of liquid nitrogen rather than on ice. In the case of Arabidopsis leaf discs, it is easy to obtain fully homogenized sample in a couple of seconds. Centrifuge at 14,000 x g, 4 °C for 10 min.Transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube for removing sample debris.Protein measurementPrepare the dye for Bio-Rad Protein Assay by diluting 1 volume of the dye reagent concentrate with 4 volumes of distilled, deionized (DDI) water.Add 2 and 5 µl protein extract into 198 and 195 µl diluted dye reagent, respectively.After 5 min, measure absorbance at 595 nm and estimate the protein concentration with protein standard II (BSA) in Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit (0.2 to 2.0 mg/ml).Thiol alkylationAdjust the protein concentration to 1.0 mg/ml with the extraction buffer and combine several samples to prepare 1.5 ml of protein extract in a single tube.Divide the solution into three 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. Each tube contains 500 µl of the extract, one each for the determination of free thiols (tube A), disulfide bonds (tube B), and total thiols (tube C) in the protein extracts. All the tubes should be kept on ice until use.",
    "Note: For all experiments, we strongly recommend starting from a single protein extract to discriminately detect free thiols, disulfide bonds, and total thiols in proteins to minimize the sample variations. Add 2.5 µl FOCUSTM alkylation buffer to tubes B and C, and vortex for 10 s.Add 25 µl 0.4 M IAA (prepare immediately prior to use, Recipe 2) only in tube B for detection of disulfide bonds. Incubate tubes B and C without shaking at room temperature (approximately 23 °C), under dark for 30 min.Protein purificationAdd an equal volume of cold 20% (w/v) TCA solution to tubes B and C.Centrifuge the tubes at 14,000 x g, 4 °C for 30 min.Remove the supernatant, leaving the protein pellet intact.Remove TCA by washing pellet twice with 500 µl cold acetone and retain the pellet.Disulfide reductionAdjust the protein reduction solution by adding 2.5 µl FOCUSTM Reductant buffer and 10 µl FOCUSTM Protein Reductant (or 250 mM TCEP in DDI water) to 487.5 µl DDI water.Add 50 µl reduction solution to tubes B and C, and then suspend the pellet by gently pipetting up and down. Here, the pellet is not completely dissolved.Incubate the tubes at 55 °C for 1 h. Vortex for 10 s every 10 min and confirm the complete dissolution of pellet after incubation.mBB labelingAdd 25 µl of 60 mM mBB solution to tubes A, B, and C.Note: TCEP can be involved in dehalogenation of mBB and might weaken the efficiency of fluorescent labeling in solution (Graham et al., 2003). Be sure to keep the mBB concentration higher than that of TCEP in the labeling solution. Incubate at room temperature (approximately 23 °C) for 15 min.To remove excess unreacted mBB, add an equal volume of cold 20% (w/v) TCA solution to tubes A, B, and C.",
    "Centrifuge the tubes at 14,000 x g, 4 °C for 30 min.Remove the supernatant, leaving the protein pellet intact.Remove TCA by washing pellet twice each with 500 µl cold acetone and retain the pellet.Separation of the labeled proteinsSuspend the pellets in 10-25 µl SDS-PAGE sample buffer (can be stored at room temperature for 1 week, Recipe 3) and boil for 3 min.Assemble the Mini-PROTEAN TGX gel in Mini-PROTEAN Tetra system and pour SDS-PAGE buffer (can be stored at room temperature for 1 month, Recipe 4).Load the boiled samples, equivalent to 20-40 µg of proteins, to the sample well. Note: The initial amount of protein per tube is approximately 50 µg. Adjust and determine the loading volume based on some pilot experiments in the laboratory. We recommend setting an experimental replicate for SDS-PAGE with approximately 20 µg protein, for example, a replicate with 10 µl of the solution obtained by resuspending the pellet in 25 µl SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Start the electrophoretic run at 100 V and stop after the samples have traversed the desired distance.Protein visualizationPlace the gel on UV transilluminator and irradiate the gel.Use yellow filter to obtain fluorescence derived from mBB-labeled protein.Note: mBB has an excitation maximum at 394 nm and an emission maximum at 490 nm."
