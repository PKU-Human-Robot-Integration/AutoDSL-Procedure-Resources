    "See Figure 2 for the steps of the experimental procedure.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190814/20190814231850_4444.jpgFigure 2. Graphic representation of the behavioral testing steps. The behavioral testing consists of a habituation phase, in which the mice get used to the experimental cage, the novel environment and the experimenter. Habituation is then followed by sham-stimulation trial, where the wooden stick is introduced in the cage avoiding tactile contact with the animal. This will provide a baseline score of the animal anxious behavior (animals with high anxious response to the sham condition should be excluded from the WN test). Finally, the actual test phase will consist in bilateral stimulation of mice facial vibrissae.Notes: Each experimental mouse must be single-housed in a cage at least 1 week prior to beginning of behavioral testing. These cages are referred to as home cages.  Behavioral experiments must be performed in a dedicated room. Ideally, the behavioral room should have black curtains all around the experiment area in order to minimize the interference with environmental stimuli. The room must also be free of conspecific and heterospecific odors, since they can affect mouse behavior. Noise should also be reduced to the minimum or to a comparable level of housing room. The experimenter must avoid making loud noises or sudden movements during both the habituation phase than the experimental phase.  The light should be reduced or at least indirect, however attention should be paid to the quality of video recording. We recommend always running a pilot experiment to establish position of the camera and the cage and standardizing the experimental environment before starting the proper experiment. Once the experimental conditions are standardized the experimenters can proceed with the behavioral testing.",
    "Preparation of experimental cages (Day 0)Prepare several clean cages equal to the number of mice you intend to test, these cages are referred to as experimental cages. Be sure to label all the cages properly since each mouse will have its own experimental cage.Transfer a handful of bedding from the home cage to the experimental cage, close it and leave it for all the night. This step is necessary in order to facilitate the habituation to the novel environment. Be sure to clean your hands with alcohol each time you change cage.Note: At any point during the experiment the investigator performing both stimulation and scoring of the test must be blinded from the experimental conditions. This procedure is easily applicable by preventing the experimenter from knowing the mice group of belonging.Habituation phase (Days 1-3)Choose a time for the habituation phase and the behavioral testing (i.e., morning), and then keep it for the duration of the whole experimental procedure. It is very important to be consistent in testing time parameters.Remove the bedding from the experimental cage.Transfer the mouse from its home cage to its experimental cage, without lid (Figure 3).Note: The cage should be placed in the same position every day; use adhesive tape to keep track of the correct position.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190814/20190814231915_9911.jpgFigure 3. Mouse in the experimental cage during habituation phaseLeave the animal in the experimental cage for 30 min. Be there, the animal should habituate also to your presence.Note: The first day of habituation is the trickiest, the animals could be scared and jump out of the cage, pay attention and be patient.At the end of the habituation phase transfer the mouse from the experimental cage to its home cage.Remove all the urine and fecal boli from the experimental cage and clean with 70% ethanol.",
    "Place a handful of bedding from the home cage to the experimental cage, close it and leave it for all the night.On Day 2 repeat Steps B1 to B6.On Day 3 repeat Steps B1 to B6.Note: The habituation phase should be performed for at least 3 days, less days could have a negative impact on the behavioral assessment. A successful habituation is when the animals show no sign of fear, stress and/or anxiety (e.g., freezing, evasiveness, excessive grooming) due to the novel environment and to the presence of the experimenters. Experimental phase (Day 4)The experimental phase consists in the sham stimulation and in three trials of bilateral whisker stimulation. Both sham phase and stimulation phase last 5 min with 1 min of inter-trial interval.Remove the bedding from the experimental cage.Transfer the mouse from its home cage to its experimental cage, close the lid and position the cage in front of the camera.Leave the animal in the experimental cage for 30 min.Open the lid of the cage and start recordingStart sham stimulation for 5 min (Video 1).Note: In the sham stimulation, the animal is presented with the wooden stick. Pretend to stimulate the whisker of the mouse without touching them. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Example of sham stimulation. (All animal procedures described in this protocol were approved by the University of Trento animal care committee and the Italian Ministry of Health (protocol 949/2015-PR).)Start directly with trial 1 and continuously stimulate the whiskers for 5 min (Video 2).Note. Use rhythmic movements to bend the middle of the whiskers and alternate the whisker stimulation (about 3 seconds in duration) for each side of the mouse’s snout.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Example of whisker stimulation.",
    "(All animal procedures described in this protocol were approved by the University of Trento animal care committee and the Italian Ministry of Health (protocol 949/2015-PR).)Wait 1 min.Repeat Steps C6 and C7 other 2 times.Stop the recording, save the video on a computer and go on with another mouse."
