    "1. Sample fixation and resin embedding\nSamples of fresh tissue and cells are fixed for at least 2 hours in 2% paraformaldehyde, and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at a pH of 7.4. The sample size should not exceed 0.150 mm in thickness to allow adequate penetration or fixative, and should not be left in the fix for longer than 12 hours.\nPlace the samples in 20ml glass scintillation vials and rinse them three times, 5 minutes each, in 0.1M cacodylate buffer.\nStain with 1.5 % (w/v) potassium ferrocyanide and 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) for 30 minutes.\nStain with 1.0 % (w/v) osmium tetroxide in 0.1M cacodylate buffer for 30 minutes.\nRinse once with double distilled water for 3 minutes.\nStain with 1 % (w/v) uranyl acetate in double distilled water for 30 minutes.\nRinse sections for 5 minutes in double distilled water, and then dehydrate in graded alcohol series, 2 mins each change (1 x 50 %, 1 x 70 %, 1 x 90 %, 1 x 95 %, 2 x 100 %).\nEmbed in increasing concentrations of Durcupan resin mixed with ethanol, 30 minutes each change, starting at 50% Durcupan in ethanol, then followed by: 70%, 90%, 95%, and then 100%.\nReplace with fresh Durcupan and agitate slowly for 4 hours.\nPlace sections, using wooden cocktail sticks, on glass microscopes slides coated with mould separating agent, and place in 65° C oven for 24 hours.\n2. Preparing the sample for the FIB/SEM\nSeparate the resin layer, containing the samples, from between the two glass microscope slides and wash thoroughly to remove any mould separating agent.",
    "Using a transmitted light microscope with low power objectives, or dissecting microscope with transmitted illumination, to identify the region of interest within the slice of resin.\nCut a small (3 mm x 3 mm) square around the region of interest using a razor blade and stick this to the top of blank resin block with acrylic glue (Figure 1). Wait 5 minutes for the glue to harden, and then proceed with the next step.\nClamp the block into the holder of the ulramicrotome and, using the attached stereomicroscope, trim around the region of interest with a razor blade until only a small pyramid of material remains.\nFurther trim the block, using a glass knife fixed into the ultramicrotome, so that the region of interest can be precisely located with respect the dimensions of the block’s surface (Figure 1). Cut one edge of the block, close to the region of interest, so that a perpendicular step is cut through the sample (Figure 1 and 2). This step forms the imaging face (Figure 2).\nRemove the block from the ultramicrotome and photograph the region of interest within the block, using a transmitted light microscope.\nCut the trimmed block away from the remaining resin stub. This is done by using a jeweller’s saw and ensures that only a small block is placed inside the FIB/SEM. The total height of this block should not be more than 5 mm.\nGlue the block to an aluminium stub with carbon paste ensuring that the side to be imaged is on the outermost edge (Figure 1).\nAfter the glue has dried, coat the block with a thin layer of gold (> 20 nm; Cressington vacuum evaporation system).\n3. Imaging in the FIB/SEM",
    "At a low magnification, and using secondary electron imaging ( 5 kV, 0.5 nAmp), orient the block so that the chosen region of interest and the side of the block to be imaged is facing the operator (Figure 2 c, d).\nOrient the block so that the face to be imaged lies parallel to the milling beam. This will mean that electron beam is oriented at 54 ° to this face (Figure 2 b).\nUsing an ion beam current of  13 - 27 nAmps at 30 kV remove a narrow band of resin from the front of the region to be imaged.\nSwitch to backscattered imaging mode to view the milled face that overlies the region of interest. \nUsing the light microscopy reference image (taken at step 16) and the image of the milled face locate the exact region on the block to be milled and imaged (Figure 2).\nDeposit a protective layer (approximately 1 micron thick) of carbon (or metal), using the gas injection system of the microscope, onto the surface of the block, above the region of interest (Figure 2).\nUsing a current of  700 picoAmps, finely mill the region of the block within which the final images will be taken.\nLeave the milling beam to completely mill this image face until no milling artifacts can be seen on the face. A complete mill of the face is checked by observing changes in each subsequent image across the entire field of view. Inadequate milling can also seen as white streaks or ‘curtains’ appearing vertically in the image.\nLeave the microscope for a least 2 hours for any thermal changes to dissipate. This reduces the risk that the block face will drift during imaging, resulting in misaligned images.",
    "Select the microscope parameters for imaging the face serially. Ensure that the electron beam has a voltage that is low enough to only image a very shallow depth of material in the block face. This should also be much shallower than the thickness of the face to be removed. Typical parameters for imaging are voltages of between 1.2 - 2.0 kV with pixel sizes of between 4 - 20  nm. The pixel dwell time needs to be kept around 10 μsecs so that the total time to mill the face and acquire one image is maintained below 2 minutes (Figure 3).\n4. Secrets to success\nStep 1) Ensure the samples are not thicker than 150 microns. This will enable adequate penetration of the different stains and resin into the material. This can be achieved by sectioning the samples with a vibratome immediately after the fixation. This thickness is appropriate for brain  tissue. Other tissues need to be tested to ensure adequate fixation and staining.\nStep 3) The samples must be freely distributed throughout the solution, and not clumped together in one part of the vial while this secondary fixative is introduced. This will ensure maximum penetration of the sample and reduce the sample becoming distorted during this fixation process. This is achieved by gently swirling the samples within the vial immediately after the solution is added.\nStep 15) Ensure that the region of interest is located immediately below (< 30 microns) the surface of the block. This will reduce the amount of milling by the ion beam during the image acquisition phase.",
    "Step 22) The scanning time of the ion beam needs to be adequte to ensure that the entire imaging face is completely milled. Inadequate milling will be shown as white streaks, or ‘curtains’ appearing vertically down the imaging face.\nStep 26) The final milled face must be larger than the face that is imaged. This is because the milled resin is ejected from the block and redeposits on the block surface in the immediate vicinity. This redeposition can encroach onto the imaging field of view, and is avoided by milling a much large area than is imaged. For an imaging window that is 20 microns wide, the milled block face is greater than 30 microns wide.\nStep 29) It is critical that the electron beam parameters are such that the image is generated by electrons that emerge from only the first few nanometres of the block’s surface. This a acheved by minimising the voltage to below 2 kV and ensuring that no electrons penetrate too far. This is also helped by using a grid voltage on the detector so that only the electron with the highest energies contribute to the final image. Typically, a grid tension of 1.3 kV is used for an imaging voltage of 1.5 kV.\n5. Representative Results:",
