    "1. Preparation and Incubation of a DNA Sample\nPrepare DNA constructs that are ligated to duplex ends (typically employ ≈ 600 bp DNA PCR fragments) that are functionalized with multiple biotin and digoxigenin groups, respectively18. To start, a DNA tether length > 1 µm, e.g., a 7.9 kbp corresponding to a stretched length of ~2.7 µm as employed here, is recommended for ease of use; in particular, using a DNA length that is similar to or shorter than the bead radius is problematic due to the attachment geometry in the MTT and FOMT. See the Discussion for a description of how DNA length influences temporal response in the angular domain.\nAssemble the flow cells for single-molecule experiments. For the flow cells, use two glass microscope coverslips separated by a double-layer Parafilm spacer. The top microscope coverslip should have two holes for the fluid in- and outlets to the cell. It is convenient to use a sandblaster to drill the holes. The bottom coverslip is coated with nitrocellulose (0.1% wt/vol in amyl acetate). Place the Parafilm spacers on the nitrocellulose-coated side of the bottom slides and close the top with clean top slides.\nSeal the flow cells. Using physical tweezers, place the assembled flow cell on a heater plate set to 80-100 °C for ~1 min. Pay attention that the flow cell is well sealed, that the Parafilm does not close off the holes that connect to the in- and outlet, and that the glass slides are well aligned.\n\tNote: To ensure a good seal, it is recommended to stroke out bubbles in the Parafilm using a large cotton swab. The flow cell can then be mounted on the magnetic tweezers instrument.",
    "Prepare buffers. Prepare TE tethering buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and 200 mM NaCl). Alternatively, one can use PBS buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) supplemented with 100 μg/ml BSA, 0.1% Tween and 5 mM sodium azide (PBS+) as tethering buffer. Flush 2-3 cell volumes TE tethering buffer into the flow cell.\nIncubate 0.5 or 1.5 μm radius non-magnetic latex beads in the flow cell for ~30 min. These beads will act as reference beads during magnetic tweezers measurements that allow one to minimize the effect of drift between the objective and the sample holder (i.e. the flow cell). Flush out unattached non-magnetic beads by rinsing with 2-3 cell volumes of TE tethering buffer.\nFunctionalize the bottom surface of the flow cell by incubation with 100 μg/ml anti-digoxigenin in PBS for at least 1 hr (preferably longer; incubation can be carried out overnight), to provide for DNA attachment. Rinse with 2-3 cell volumes of TE tethering buffer. Finally incubate the flow cell with 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TE tethering buffer for 30 min for surface passivation.\nTake an aliquot of 2 ml streptavidin-coated superparamagnetic MyOne beads (see Discussion and Table of Materials) and dilute with 10 ml TE tethering buffer. Wash twice with 10 ml TE tethering buffer using a magnetic particle concentrator, and resuspend in 10 ml TE tethering buffer. Attach ~1 ml of the DNA molecules (approximately 1 ng) to these beads by incubation in TE tethering buffer for 30 min.",
    "Dilute the solution of the DNA-tethered superparamagnetic beads ten-fold by adding 90 ml TE tethering buffer. Finally, inject the solution into the flow cell and incubate for ~1 hr to allow for DNA attach­ment to the anti-digoxigenin-coated surface. Wash the flow cell thoroughly with TE tethering buffer. After incubation of the DNA-tether constructs, flush extensively with experimental buffer (this can be TE tethering buffer) to remove all non-attached beads.\nFor measurements that employ an angular tracking protocol that requires fiducial marker beads attached to the magnetic beads23 (see Discussion), incubate the flow cell with 1,000-fold diluted stock of marker beads in TE tethering buffer for at least 30 min and rinse with the buffer thoroughly.\n2. Measurements on a Single DNA Molecule in the Conventional Magnetic Tweezers\nUsing a conventional MT (see Discussion) with appropriate field configuration (Figure 1a) and both translational and rotational control of the magnet position, search for rotationally constrained DNA molecules in the flow cell. At pulling forces of ≥ 1 pN (consult references 4,19,20,28,29 regarding force calibration in magnetic tweezers), tethered beads can easily be distinguished from beads stuck to the surface of the bottom slide by their different heights in the focus. Whether a DNA molecule is rotationally constrained can be assessed by introducing 20-30 turns of the magnets at a force of ≈ 0.25 pN: here, the tether length should decrease by 0.4-0.5 μm.\n\tNote: To run magnetic tweezers experiments, image processing is used to determine the x,y, and z position of DNA-tethered beads. Custom Labview software for this purpose is available from the authors upon request.",
    "Verify that the bead is attached by a single DNA tether. This can be done by comparing the behavior under positive and negative turns at forces of > 1 pN (Figure 2a). In this force regime, the presence of multiple DNA tethers will give rise to an approximately symmetric decrease in the extension upon introducing positive and negative turns, whereas single DNA tethers will give rise to an asymmetric response.\nSearch for appropriate fixed beads stuck to the bottom surface in the vicinity of the tether of interest that can serve as reference beads.\nCalibrate the length of the DNA, l. The position of the flowcell surface can be determined by bringing the tethered bead in contact with the surface (e.g., by rotating the magnet by ~60 turns at a force below 0.2 pN). Measurements of the tethered bead’s vertical position with respect to this surface then report on absolute value of l.\n\tNote: To minimize subsequent effects of drift, it is advised to perform measurements of l relative to the position of a reference bead affixed to the surface.\nRecord a rotation curve (i.e. a measurement of the DNA extension as a function of the number of turns) at a stretching force of ≈ 0.25 pN (Figure 2a).\n\t\nDetermine the number of turns at which the extension is maximal, as this corresponds to the state at which the DNA molecule is torsionally relaxed. To do so, it is useful to fit the rotation curve locally with a parabolic or a Gaussian function to determine the center position. Define this point as “zero turns”.\n\t\tNote: A custom-written routine for this purpose is available from the authors upon request.",
    "For a series of ~20 magnet positions, determine the average extension of the torsionally-relaxed molecule (i.e. at “zero turns”, see step 2.4.1) from the z-trace.\nFor each measurement point in step 2.5, precisely determine the stretching force from the fluctuations in the x or y position20,28,29, or, provided the magnetization of the bead is well-known, using knowledge of the local field gradient4. Plotting the stretching force versus the average extension results in a force-extension curve (Figure 2b).\n\t\nFit the resulting force-extension data to the worm-like chain equation using the polynomial approximation by Bouchiat et al30.\nIf preparing for subsequent FOMT measurements, slowly rotate the magnets while recording the magnetic bead’s excursions in (x,y).\n\tNote: The smaller the radius of the resulting annulus in the conventional MT configuration, the more closely the DNA molecule is tethered closer to the “south pole” of the magnetic bead. When one switches to the FOMT configuration, such a DNA molecule will be tethered closely to the “equator” of the magnetic bead, which enables reliable tracking of the rotation angle from the (x,y)-position (see Discussion).\n3. Measurements of DNA Twist Using the Freely-orbiting Magnetic Tweezers\nManually replace the square magnets of the conventional magnetic tweezers by a cylindrical magnet that is used for FOMT (Figure 1b). This operation should be performed in such a way that the selected DNA tether remains within the field of view.\n\t\nThis can be accomplished in less than 1 min by simply unscrewing the complete magnet head that holds the magnets for the conventional tweezers configuration and replacing it by a magnet head that holds a cylindrical magnet for FOMT.",
    "The excursions in (x,y) of a magnetic bead tethered by a single dsDNA tether depend strongly on the position of the tether with respect to the axis of the cylindrical magnet (Figure 1b, Figure 3a). Record the (x,y) excursions in order to determine the corresponding location within the characteristic fluctuation pattern (Figure 3a, Discussion).\nPerform coarse alignment of the magnet in the FOMT. This can be achieved by moving the cylindrical magnet above the flow-cell using (x,y) translation stages. If the (x,y) excursions follow an arc, the cylindrical magnet is not properly aligned and needs to be moved in the appropriate direction (Figure 3b).\n\t\nCoarse alignment can be accomplished within 15 min for the case of MyOne beads with 7.9 kbp tethers, and is complete when measurement of the (x,y) excursions results in the observation of circular motion (Figure 3b, center).\n\t\tNote: Coarse alignment is typically sufficient to observe the changes in twist occasioned by protein binding to single DNAs tethered in the FOMT configuration21,31 (Representative Results, Figure 5), despite the fact the accompanying two-dimensional histogram may not have its counts absolutely uniformly distributed along the circular annulus (Figure 3c).\nIf required for further experiments, perform fine alignment in the FOMT. This can be achieved using high-resolution micrometer screws or a high-resolution automated stage to either move the magnet or the flow cell to center the cylindrical magnet onto the bead to within ~10 µm. In the fine alignment stage, the magnet is carefully positioned such that the fluctuations on the circle annulus are nearly uniform, corresponding to a situation where the energy barrier to full rotation due to the magnet is kBT (Figure 4).\n\tNote: A MATLAB script for plotting the fluctuations in a histogram or thermogram as in Figure 4 is available from the authors upon request.",
    "Note: Fine alignment can be accomplished within 45 min for the case of MyOne beads with 7.9 kbp tethers, and in reduced timeframes for smaller beads and shorter tethers are employed (see Discussion).\n\tNote: Fine alignment is typically required to perform measurements of the torsional stiffness of bare or protein-coated DNA (Representative Results, Figure 4).\nIf required for analysis, calibrate the force in the FOMT. This can be carried in a manner analogous to MT, using either the bead’s radial fluctuations <r2> (where the angled brackets denote the time average) as shown in the accompanying video and detailed in Lipfert et al21, or, provided the magnetization of the bead is well-known, using knowledge of the local field gradient21.\n4. Measurements of DNA Torque Using the Magnetic Torque Tweezers\nManually replace the cylindrical magnet that is used for FOMT by a cylindrical magnet plus a side (permanent) magnet for the MTT (Figure 1c). This operation should be performed in such a way that the selected DNA tether remains within the field of view.\n\t\nThe most straightforward way to achieve this is to manually add the side magnet at its proper location, which can be accomplished within 1 min. No further realignment is necessary.\n\t\tNote: An alternative to a side magnet is the use of electromagnets32.\nIf required for analysis, calibrate the force in a manner analogous to MT, using either the bead’s x or y fluctuations or, provided the magnetization of the bead is well-known, using knowledge of the local field gradient21.",
    "Track the angular fluctuations as a function of time θ(t) using either the fiducial based tracking protocol23 or, as shown in the accompanying video, the angular tracking protocol based on monitoring the (x,y)-position (see Discussion). In the former case, record full images of the bead as a function of time for subsequent image processing. In the latter case, it is sufficient to record the bead’s (x,y) fluctuations at this step.\n\tNote: A MATLAB script for determining θ(t) from full images of the bead as a function of time in the fiducial based tracking protocol is available from the authors upon request.\n\t\nAs described in the Discussion, for the angular tracking protocol based on monitoring the (x,y)-position it is also advisable to record a time trace where the magnets are slowly (typically at 0.1 Hz) rotated by several turns. This will allow one to accurately convert Cartesian coordinates (x,y) into polar coordinates (r,θ) using Equations 3-5 of the Discussion.\n\t\tNote: A MATLAB script for angular tracking script based on monitoring the (x,y)-position is available from the authors upon request.\n\t\tNote: The measurement time depends mostly on the desired torque resolution. A detailed argument is given in Lipfert et al24. For MyOne beads and 8 kbp DNA tethers, measuring for 30-100 sec should be sufficient to give a torque resolution in the range of ~1 pN·nm.\nDetermine the stiffness of the torsional trap from the variance of the angular fluctuations (σθ2, in radians) using:\nkθ = kBT / σθ2 (1)\n\tNote: Typical rotational trap stiffnesses achieved in the MTT are in the range of 10-1,000 pN·nm/rad, lower than for conventional magnetic tweezers.\nIn addition, record the z-position of the bead and use this to determine the tether length l (see also steps 2.4-2.7).\nRotate N turns and again record θ(t) and l(t).",
    "Note: The reduced rotational trap stiffness of the MTT compared to MT renders it suitable for measurements of single molecule torque, but implies that the maximum torque that can be exerted is reduced. This implies that the MTT may not be able to counterbalance high drag torques caused by rapid rotation. Care must therefore be taken not to exceed the maximum speed; typically rotate at rates close to 0.1 Hz.\nDetermine the torque accumulated in the nucleic acid tether after N turns using:\n\tΓ = − kθ <θN - θ0> (2)\n\tWhere <…> denotes the average and θ0 and θN are the angle at zero turns (corresponding to a torsionally relaxed tether, cf. step 2.3 and N turns, respectively.\nRepeat steps 4.5 and 4.6 as necessary in order to fully determine a molecule’s torque response in a single measurement run (Representative Results, Figure 6)."
