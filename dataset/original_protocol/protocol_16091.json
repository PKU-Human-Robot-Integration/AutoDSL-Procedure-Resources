    "Years ago, Lian and colleagues developed a protocol for differentiating iPS cells into cardiomyocytes by modulating canonical Wnt signaling pathways with small molecules (Lian et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0029]). Here, we have adapted that protocol from Lian et al. (2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0029]) and Herron et al. (2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0021]) to obtain differentiated cardiomyocytes from iPS cells (Fig. 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-fig-0001]). The following protocol yields mostly ventricular-like cardiomyocytes, with a small proportion of atrial and nodal-like cells as well (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-fig-0001]). Minor variations in the protocol can allow differentiation of only ventricular-like or atrial-like cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-fig-0001] and 1C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-fig-0001]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/481357d6-6291-4402-8963-87e04751ba6f/cpz1601-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nSchematic of the cardiac differentiation protocols. (A) Mixed CM Population Protocol: After iPSC monolayers reach 90%-100% confluence, cardiomyocyte induction begins on day 0 with the addition of CHIR and concludes on day 8 with the addition of RPMI B27+ medium to the cells. (B) Ventricular Population Protocol: Using medium containing ʟ-ascorbic acid and human albumin from day 0 to day 7 produces ventricular-like iPSC-cardiomyocytes. (C) Atrial Population Protocol: Basal medium, as in the ventricular protocol, is used to induce chamber-specific iPSC-CMs. Here, retinoic acid is also added from days 3 to 6 to induce atrial-like iPSC-cardiomyocytes. RPMI B27– medium is not used in either the ventricular- or atrial-specific protocols. All of the protocols displayed follow similar steps for inducing iPSC-CM differentiation.\nNOTE: Perform all cell culture manipulations in a laminar flow hood.\nMaterials\niPS cell lines\nMatrigel (cat. no. 345277, Corning)\nStemMACS iPS-Brew XF (with supplements; cat. no. 130-107-086, Miltenyi Biotec)\nVersene solution (cat. no. 15040066, Gibco)\nROCK inhibitor (cat. no.

Seed ∼5 million iPS cells into a Matrigel-coated six-well plate in 2 ml of StemMACS iPSC Brew XF medium per well. Culture in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator for 5-6 days, until confluent.\nChange the medium every other day until cells show high confluency.\nDepending on the iPS cell line, some iPSC colonies will exhibit morphological changes after ∼6 days in culture, which may indicate spontaneous differentiation. It is worth noting that undifferentiated iPSC colonies are compact, with well-defined edges. Furthermore, iPS cells have a large nucleus with little cytoplasm.\nTo continue the culture of any iPS cell line, transfer a few colonies to an additional Matrigel-coated plate and culture until they reach 80%-90% confluency. Repeat the process as needed.\nDepending on the iPS cell line, ROCK inhibitor may be required (e.g., when the cells do not form a stable attachment to the matrix substrate).\n2. Aspirate the medium and then dissociate iPS cells using 1 ml/well of Versene solution at 37°C for 7 min. Reseed as monolayers on Matrigel-coated (100 μg/ml) 12-well plates at a density of 8.5 × 106 cells/well in 2 ml StemMACS iPSC Brew XF medium supplemented with 5 μmol/L ROCK inhibitor.\nReplace medium every day.\n3.

This small molecule induces iPSC differentiation to vascular progenitors in this protocol step.",
    "A small percentage of cell death (∼20%) is usually expected. If more than half of the cells die after CHIR treatment (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-fig-0002], left), discard the plate and begin the differentiation process again.\nThe concentration of CHIR may vary depending on the iPS cell line. It needs to be adjusted empirically until the appropriate concentration is identified.

Add 1 μl/ml IWP4 (10 μmol/L); you will have a total volume of 3 ml per well.\nIWP4 promotes cardiomyocyte differentiation in iPS cells after treatment with CHIR99021.\nA small percentage of cell death (∼20%) is usually expected, although to a lesser extent than after CHIR addition (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-fig-0002], right).

    "Do not even handle the plate.\n10. Day 7: Aspirate the medium and add 2 ml of RPMI supplemented with B27 containing insulin (RPMI/B27+) per well.\n11. From day 8 onward, change the medium every day until the cells are ready for purification.\nCells typically begin beating between days 9 and 12. If no beating is observed by day 15, discard the plate.\nThe cells usually are ready for purification ∼15-30 days after starting the differentiation protocol.\nUnpurified beating monolayers can be cultured for up to 1 month at this stage (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-fig-0002]).",
    "The directed differentiation method used here (adapted from Herron, Monteiro da Rocha, & Campbell, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0020], and Pekkanen-Mattila et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0040]) should generate a cell population that is 20%-80% cardiomyocytes. For most downstream applications, the cardiac monolayers need to be purified. Currently, the most widely used method for purifying iPSC-CMs is based on THE significant differences in glucose and lactate metabolism between CMs and non-CMs (Tohyama et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0050]). Although this means of iPSC-CM purification has been widely adopted and is a highly efficient method for large-scale purification, the same medium composition has also been used in the past to simulate ischemia preconditioning in cultured adult CMs (Diaz & Wilson, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0014]). In other studies, a similar glucose-free solution was used as “injury solution” to cause localized ischemic injury in cardiac monolayers (Arutunyan, Webster, Swift, & Sarvazyan, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0001]; Vanden Hoek et al., 1996[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0054]). On the other hand, using the magnetic bead purification protocol that follows (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-fig-0003]), we obtain a large number of iPSC-CMs without an ischemic-injury-like phenotype that are appropriate for variety of studies (Block et al., 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0003]; da Rocha, Creech, Thonn, Mironov, & Herron, 2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0011]; Davis et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0012]; Herron et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0020]; Jimenez-Vazquez et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0025]; Ponce-Balbuena et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0041]). This method has been also described and validated for use in proarrhythmia cardiotoxicity assays (da Rocha et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0010]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cf730e9f-c032-419e-a179-0c17351feaa8/cpz1601-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",

Add 2 ml EB20 medium per well of dissociated cells to inactivate the trypsin. Triturate each well up to 10 times with a 10-ml serological pipet and transfer the cells into a sterile 50-ml conical tube fitted with a 70-µm strainer.

    "4. Count the cells as follows: Transfer 5 μl of the trypsinized cell suspension to a 1-ml centrifuge tube and mix with 45 μl trypan blue. Transfer 15-20 μl of the cell suspension between the hemocytometer and cover glass using a 20-μl (P-20) micropipettor.

    "Standard cell culture techniques produce confluent but unstructured monolayers. Unlike native adult cardiomyocytes, iPSC-CMs do not retain many key structural and functional properties that are essential for many applications in cardiac research. The lack of myocyte alignment in iPSC-CMs is a significant deviation from the phenotype of adult cardiomyocytes in vivo, as evidenced by the irregular sarcomere alignment of iPSC-CMs plated on traditional planar substrates (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-fig-0005]). Importantly, there are several reports indicating that cell shape and substrate stiffness improve contractile activity and facilitate maturation of iPSC-CMs (Chen, Mrksich, Huang, Whitesides, & Ingber, 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0007]; da Rocha et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0010]; Dike et al., 1999[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0015]; Herron et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0021]; Kuo et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0027]; Ribeiro et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0043]). Micropatterning provides a structural framework that promotes the formation of rod-shaped iPSC-CMs that more accurately reproduce adult cardiomyocyte structure and function (e.g., increased expression of structural genes, greater sarcomere organization, matured mitochondria function, binucleation, etc.). The micropatterning platform detailed below (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-fig-0006]), adapted from Kuo et al. (2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-bib-0027]), produces contracting single cells (Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-fig-0007]) through the use of a reusable micropatterned silicone stamp that is compatible with a variety of matrix protein solutions. The stamp will leave a patterned growth substrate on the PDMS membrane that will provide the spatial resolution and structure for appropriate iPSC-CM anisotropy. The cell seeding pattern is also easily adaptable using different types of micropatterned silicone stamps. iPSC-CMs should be cultured as a monolayer for at least 7 days to induce maturation (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-prot-0002], step 20) before the cardiomyocytes are re-plated onto the micropatterned PDMS.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2c6ec2e1-265b-4635-937d-718dc846ad08/cpz1601-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6",

Carefully clean the surface of the silicone stamps with Scotch tape by placing it onto the stamp surface and slowly removing it (this is to remove residues from Matrigel used before). After that, sonicate the stamps in 70% ethanol/Milli-Q water for at least 20 min.\nAvoid scratching the stamp surface.\nThe micropatterned area is 1 cm × 1 cm total (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-fig-0008]). Each micropattern is 50 μm in height and 300 μm in width, and they are spaced apart from each other by 4 µm.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6b8d0e65-13ef-4f71-b4ec-6b85ad88394d/cpz1601-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nSilicone micropatterned stamp.\n2. Dry the stamps in a sterile hood and then apply 250 μl Matrigel diluted 1:100 in di-water. Incubate the stamps in the diluted Matrigel at room temperature for at least 1 hr.\nKeep the Matrigel solution on ice because any left over can be used the next day.\n3. Using a punch tool, cut 18-mm PDMS circles from a sheet of PDMS and sonicate them in 70% ethanol for 20 min.\n4. Shake excess ethanol off the 18-mm PDMS circles and transfer them to a six-well plate.\n5. When ready for microprinting, treat the PDMS culture dish with UVO (UV light/ozone) for 9 min with lid off.\nUVO treatment is necessary to reduce the hydrophobicity of PDMS and allow Matrigel micropatterns to be transferred from the stamps.",
    "This UVO incubation time is for PDMS with a stiffness of ∼3 MPa.\n6. While UVO is performed on PDMS circles, aspirate the Matrigel solution from the PDMS stamps.\n7. After UVO is completed, invert the dried stamps onto each PDMS circle, and remove one by one after ∼2 min.\nLet the plate cool down for ∼20 s before placing the dried stamps onto each PDMS membrane.\nDry the silicone stamps for no more than 10 min.\n8. Incubate the micropatterned PDMS plate with 1% Pluronic F-127 overnight at room temperature.\nPluronic F-127 is a nonionic surfactant polyol that is used in this application as a passivating agent to block unpatterned regions, making them resistant to protein absorption and thus cell adhesion. Failure to add Pluronic F-127 results in micropattern fouling.\n9. Before re-plating iPSC-CMs, clean the micropatterned plates for 1 hr with 3× PSA diluted in PBS, aspirate the PSA, and expose them to UV light for 15 min.\n10. Dissociate the iPSC-CMs monolayers using 1 ml of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and incubate the cardiomyocytes for 8-10 min at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nSpontaneous contraction in monolayers should always be observed before the cells are re-plated on the micropatterned PDMS. If monolayers are not contracting, wait additional time, for up to 5 days.\n11. After dissociation, add 1 ml of RPMI medium containing 10% FBS to inactivate the trypsin.\n12. Transfer dissociated iPSC-CMs through a 70-μm filter into a 50-ml conical tube.\n13. Collect the iPSC-CMs into a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube and centrifuge for 3 min at (112 × g), room temperature.\n14. Resuspend the iPSC-CMs in 1 ml re-plating medium.\n15. Count (see Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.601#cpz1601-prot-0002], step 4) and plate ∼30,000 iPSC-CMs in 350 μl re-plating medium in the center of the micropatterned area.",
    "16. After ∼5 hr, gently add 2 ml re-plating medium.\nThe use of re-plating medium for the next 3 days is absolutely critical for cell survival after re-plating of iPSC-CMs onto the Matrigel-coated micropatterned PDMS.\n17. Return the plate to the incubator\n18. Change the medium on days 1 and 3 after re-plating.\niPSC-CMs must be on micropatterns for at least 4 days before being used in an experiment.\nMatrigel-coated micropatterned PDMS plates can be kept for up to 3 days at 4°C before plating iPSC-cardiomyocytes."
