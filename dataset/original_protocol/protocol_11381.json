    "1. Investigation of a Putative Regulator of Hippo Signaling Using the LATS-BS\nPlating and transfection of cells\nPreparation of cell culture\n\t\t\nWarm 1x PBS, DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to 37 °C in a water bath for approximately 30 min.\nThoroughly clean a biosafety cabinet with 70% ethanol.\nPlace tissue culture dishes, Pasteur pipettes, serological pipettes, and pipette tips into the tissue culture hood as required.\nTake out 1x PBS, the media, and the trypsin-EDTA from the water bath, clean them with 70% ethanol, and place them in the hood.\nMaintenance and plating of the cells for transfection\n\t\t\nChoose a cell line with a high transfection efficiency (e.g., HEK293) for the experiment. Check for the expression of Hippo pathway components in this cell line by western blot to make sure Hippo signaling is active.\nGrow HEK293 cells in DMEM in 10 cm Petri dishes in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Monitor the cells under a microscope every day. Passage the cells as described below when 80–90% confluency is observed.\nWash the cells by adding 5 mL of 1x PBS into a plate, gently swirling the plate, and aspirating the media completely.\nAdd 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA to the plate. Swirl the plate to ensure that the trypsin evenly covers the cells.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 5 min or until all the cells are detached.\nAdd 4 mL of media (with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) to neutralize the trypsin, resuspend the cells by pipetting up and down several times, and dispense one-tenth (0.5 mL) of the cells into new 100 mm plates (for a passing ratio of 1:10) containing 9.5 mL of complete media.",
    "For LATS-BS transfection, count the cells using a hemocytometer and plate 2 x 105 cells into each well of a 12-well plate 24 h before transfection.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Using higher cell numbers may increase the background bioluminescent signal as Hippo signaling activity is regulated by cell confluency. Using lower cell numbers may increase cell sensitivity to transfection reagents and increase cell death24.\nTransfection of the LATS-BS alone or together with the candidate gene\n\t\t\nMiniprep LATS-BS plasmids (NLuc-YAP15-pcDNA3.1-Hygro and 14-3-3-CLuc-pcDNA3.1-Hygro) fresh from DH5a bacteria liquid culture (necessary to achieve an optimum LATS-BS expression).\n1 h before transfection, aspirate the medium from the plate, add 500 µL of complete growth medium to each well of the 12-well plates and return the cells to the incubator.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The following protocol describes transfection methods using a commercially available polymer-based transfection reagent. Other transfection reagents may also be suitable for transfection; however, we have not yet tested them.\nMake solutions A and B as described in Table 1. For N transfections, make (N + 0.5) x solution B premix.\nImmediately add the diluted polymer-based transfection reagent (solution B) to DNA (solution A). Pipette up and down gently to mix.\nIncubate the sample at room temperature for 15 min to allow transfection complexes to form.\nAdd the total volume (76 µL) of transfection complexes dropwise to each well of the 12-well plate with gentle swirling.\nIncubate the cells overnight (18–24 h) at 37 °C.\n\t\t\tNote: For cells that are sensitive to polymer-based transfection reagents, the incubation time can be reduced to 5 h.\nThe day after transfection, remove the transfection-complex-containing media and replace it with fresh complete media. Culture the cells at 37 °C for another day to perform luciferase assay.\nLuciferase assay",
    "NOTE: The Luciferase Reporter Assay System detecting firefly and Renilla together in one assay is used for the luciferase assays. If Renilla was not used as an internal control, perform one-step luciferase assay by adding LARII without adding the Renilla detection reagent.\n\t\nPreparation of the cell lysates\n\t\t\nDilute 5x passive lysis buffer (PLB) with distilled water as follows:\nTotal volume of 1x PLB required = N x (50 μL of 5x PLB + 200 μL of dH2O) = N x 250 μL of 1x PLB per well of the 12-well plates (N = number of samples).\nAspirate the media completely. Add 1 mL of 1x PBS into each well. Swirl the plate gently to remove detached cells and residual growth media. Aspirate the 1x PBS completely. Make sure no residual 1x PBS remains prior to the addition of 1x PLB.\nAdd 250 μL of 1x PLB/well.\nPlace the culture plates on a rocking platform with gentle rocking to ensure complete and even coverage of the cell monolayer with 1x PLB. Rock the culture plates at room temperature for 15 min to allow the cells to lyse.\nTransfer the lysate to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nMeasuring the bioluminescent signal\n\t\t\nTake out the LARII (20 μL/sample) from -80 °C and equilibrate it to room temperature.\nPrepare Renilla detection reagent for N assays: add (N + 1) x 0.4 μL of 50x Substrate to (N + 1) x 19.6 μL of its Buffer.\nPredispense 10 μL of each cell lysate to 1.5-mL tubes.\nProgram a luminometer to perform a 2-s premeasurement delay, followed by a 10-s measurement period for each dual luciferase assay.",
    "NOTE: The first and second measurements will be corresponding to the LATS-BS signal and the Renilla internal control signal, respectively. Any luminometer compatible with a single or dual luciferase can be used.\nCarefully transfer 20 μL of LARII reagent into one tube and quickly pipette up and down 3x to mix it.\nImmediately place the tube in the luminometer and initiate the reading.\nRemove the sample tube from the luminometer, immediately add 20 μL of Renilla Reagent, and mix by pipetting up and down 3x. Bring the sample in the luminometer and initiate the next reading. Record the measurements.\nDiscard the reaction tube and proceed to the next sample.\n2. A screen to Identify Hippo Pathway Regulators Using the LATS-BS\nCell culture and transfections\nCulture HEK293AD cells as described in section 1.1.\n\t\tNOTE: HEK293AD is more adherent than other HEK293 cell lines, which makes it a good cell line for use in screens.\nDetach cells as described in section 1.1.2. Count and plate 2 x 106 cells in 100 mm plates 24 h before transfection.\n1 h before transfection, aspirate the media from the plate and replace them with 5 mL of fresh complete growth media.\nMake solutions A and B as described in Table 2.\nImmediately add the diluted polymer-based transfection reagent (solution B) to DNA (solution A). Pipette up and down to mix.\nIncubate the sample at room temperature for 15 min to allow transfection complexes to form.\n\t\t\nAdd the total volume (500 µL) of transfection complexes dropwise to cells with gentle swirling.\nIncubate the cells overnight at 37 °C.",
    "The next day, trypsinize and count the cells. Plate 1 x 104 to 2 x 104 cells into each well of a 96-well plate in a total volume of 100 µL of media per well. Incubate for another day.\nThe next day, add agents/small molecules regulating the Hippo pathway at a final concentration of 10 µM to each well, 1–4 h before performing the luciferase assay.\n\t\tNote: For most small molecules/agents, a 4 h treatment at 10 µM does not affect cell viability. If a lower concentration is used, treatment may be extended for a longer period of time.\nLuciferase assay\nIn vitro luciferase assay\n\t\t\nAspirate the media from the cells completely. Wash the cells with 100 µL of 1x PBS in each well. Aspirate completely.\nAdd 20 µL of 1x PLB (prepared as described in step 1.2.1.1) into each well of the 96-well plates.\nPlace the culture plates on a rocking platform with gentle rocking at room temperature for 15 min.\nCarefully transfer 20 µL of LARII reagent into each well and pipette up and down 3x to mix.\nImmediately place the plate in a plate-reading luminometer and initiate the reading.\nLiving cell luciferase assay\n\t\t\nMake 11x D-luciferin stock as follows: dissolve 1.5 mg of D-luciferin powder in 1 mL of normal culture media.\nTransfer 10 µL of 11x D-luciferin into each well and mix it gently with the media which is already in the well.\nReplace the cells into the incubator for 10 min.\nPlace the plate in the luminometer and initiate the reading.\n\t\t\tNote: If the signal intensity is not strong enough at this concentration of D-luciferin, another 10 µL of the D-luciferin stock may be added to the cells.\nSubscription Required.
