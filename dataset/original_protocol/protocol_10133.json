    "The tissue used, and the protocol of this paper follows the ethical guidelines of Gothenburg University.\n1. Tissue Preparation and Storage\nCut the surrounding tissue from the retrieved saphenous vein using surgical forceps and scissors.\n\tNOTE: The saphenous vein is dissected from the lower limb of humans by vascular surgeons. The saphenous vein used in this paper is an un-used part after bypass surgery.\nTo prevent leakage during perfusion, ligate all the side branches at their ends with sutures and forceps.\nKeep the vein in a 50 mL tube containing 40 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Wash the vein by changing PBS 2 - 3 times to remove excess blood. Store the vein by freezing at -80 °C.\n2. Preparation of Decellularization Setups and Recellularization Bioreactor\nNOTE: Using scissors, cut the silicon tubes as shown in Table 1.\nDecellularization Setup 1 (For Triton X-100 perfusion and washing)\nTo a 2 L chamber (plastic tub), tape all three pieces of tube A as shown in Figure 1A.\n\t\tNOTE: Tape one tube to one wall where the edge touches the bottom of the chamber (detergent's inlet) and the other two tubes to the opposite wall with a distance of 5 - 10 cm in between depending on the length of the vein. At least 5 cm of these tubes should also be taped to the chamber's floor (vein's inlet and outlet).\nUsing the male and female Luer connectors, connect in series the detergent's inlet tube to tube B followed by tube F, tube C and finally to the vein inlet. Place the tube F into the cassette of the peristaltic pump I.",
    "Take another tube C and connect one end to the vein's outlet. Place the other end into the glass jar with the bottom hose outlet that is placed 45 cm above the chamber (detergent outlet) and tape it to secure. Take tube G and push one end into the hose outlet of the glass jar and place the other end into the vein chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: The pictures of complete setup (red arrows), chamber, and flow direction (white arrows) are shown in Figure 1A.\nDecellularization Setup 2 (For TnBP perfusion)\nTake a 1 L glass jar, and place one end of tube C (detergent inlet) into the jar until the tube touches the jar's bottom.\nConnect the other end to tube F followed by tube C. Place the other end of tube C into the jar until half depth (vein's inlet). Place tube F into the cassette of peristaltic pump I.\nTake tube D and place one end into the jar (vein's outlet) until half depth and the other end into the glass jar with the bottom hose placed at a 45 cm height from the vein's inlet (detergent outlet). To secure, tape the detergent's inlet and outlet tubes.\nPlace the 1 L glass jar on a magnetic stirrer and keep the magnet inside the bottle.\nTake tube G and push one end onto the hose outlet of the glass jar and place the other end into 1 L glass jar.\n\t\tNOTE: The picture of complete setup (red arrows), chamber and flow direction (white arrows) is shown in Figure 1B.\nDecellularization Setup 3 (For DNase perfusion)\nTake a 250 mL glass bottle and place both ends of tube C. Place the middle area of the tube into the cassette of peristaltic pump II.",
    "NOTE: One end of the tube is the solution inlet and the other end of the tube is connected to the vein's inlet. The vein's outlet is left free in solution.\nPlace the whole setup including pump at 37 °C. The picture of complete setup and flow direction is shown in Figure 1C.\nRecellularization Bioreactor\nKeep ready all the parts as shown in Figure 2A.\nAs shown in Figure 2B, take the 4-port cap and insert into each port, tube H (vein's outlet), tube I (media inlet), and tube J (vein's inlet). Insert the other end of tube H into the 4th port (media outlet).\n\t\tNOTE: The view of the 4-port cap from the top is shown in Figure 2C. For easy insertion of tubes, cut the edges to a sharp point with a scissor.\nBend the other end of tube J into a U shape and tie it with a suture. Connect the reducing connectors to the inner ends of tubes H & J.\nPlace the 60 mL tube with a flat base into the 250 mL glass bottle and then place the above made setup into the tube as shown in Figure 2D. As shown in Figure 2E, connect tubes K, E, and K in series. Connect one tube K to the vein's inlet and another tube K to the media inlet.\n\t\tNOTE: The schematic diagram of the setup, and flow direction is seen in Figure 2F.\nSterilize the bioreactor by autoclaving.\n3. Preparation of Solutions\nSolution 1 (10x water): To 1 L of ultrapure water, add 2 g of sodium azide and 18.6 g of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).

Agitate as above for 11 h.\nAssemble the bioreactor using sterile gloves under the LAF cabinet. Tie the vein to the bioreactor's vein inlet and outlet with sterile suture and forceps.",
    "Connect the vein to the bioreactor and fill with the same medium. Add heparin at 50 IU/mL and perfuse for 1 h at 2 mL/min in 37 °C.\nCollect 15 - 25 mL of fresh blood (depending on the vein's length) from the donor in heparin coated vacutainer tubes and dilute 1:1 with Steen solution. Later, add endocrine gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor (EG-VEGF, 80 ng/mL), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF, 4 µL/mL) and acetyl salicylic acid (5 µg/mL).\nMove the bioreactor to a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and perfuse for 48 h at 2 mL/min.\nApproximately after 12 h, move the bioreactor to a LAF cabinet, take a drop of blood and measure glucose using a blood glucose monitoring device. If the level is less than 3 mmol/L, add glucose to bring in the range of 7 - 9 mmol/L. Repeat this step every 8 - 12 h.\nAfter 48 h, move the bioreactor into the LAF cabinet and drain the blood from the bioreactor. Add 30 mL of sterile solution 7 and perfuse for 5 min. Drain the solution. Add 30 mL of sterile solution 7 and perfuse for 5 min. Repeat twice or until the blood red color is lost.\n\tNOTE: The biopsy can be taken for verification of the cell attachment. Disconnect the vein, cut 5 mm edges of the vein with scissors and discard them. Take a biopsy as stated in step 5.2 and connect the vein again to the bioreactor (optional step).\nAdd 30-45 mL of endothelial medium and perfuse for 96 h in the incubator at 2 mL/min.\n\tNOTE: Add endothelial medium until the vein is submerged.",
