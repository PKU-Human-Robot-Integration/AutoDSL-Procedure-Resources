In the example shown in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.308#cpz1308-fig-0001], we used an LLC-Pk1 pig kidney epithelial cell line.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/32f13014-7b9c-4368-ad47-9a1b7d49181e/cpz1308-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nRobust staining of DNA and polymerized actin occurs within minutes of adding OneStep Solution. Mammalian cells were imaged prior to (before and including t = 0) and during a time course with 2× OneStep solution added to an equal volume of cells in 1× PBS. Cells were imaged until the phalloidin fluorescence signal plateaued, at which time the field of view was imaged as a z-stack to record multiple focal planes within the sample. Maximum intensity projections from these z-stacks are shown on the right, with endpoint times given in min, and scale bars showing 25 µm. Representative timepoints are shown from three replicates. DAPI staining of DNA is shown in magenta, and phalloidin staining of actin polymer is shown in cyan.\n0.25% trypsin-EDTA (ThermoFisher; 25200-056) if needed to detach adherent cells\nCell culture medium \n               \nThe type of medium can vary. In the example shown in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.308#cpz1308-fig-0001], we grew the cells in a 1:1 mixture of Opti-MEM and F-10 medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic.\nOneStep Solution (optimized for LLC-Pk1 pig kidney epithelial cells; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.308#cpz1308-rec-0002])\nType B immersion oil for microscopy (Cargille; 16484) or similar immersion oil\nImaging plate: 96-well glass-bottom plate (Brooks; MGB096-1-2-LG-L), or similar glass bottom dish\n1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (Capp; 5101505, or similar)\nMicropipettes and micropipette tips (P-2.5, P-20, P-200, P-1000)\nFluorescence microscope with a camera capable of time-lapse imaging.",
    "For Figures 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.308#cpz1308-fig-0001]-3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.308#cpz1308-fig-0003], we used a Nikon Ti2 eclipse equipped with a Plan Apo λ 100× oil objective (1.45 NA), a Crest spinning disk (50 μm), a Prime 95B CMOS camera, and a Spectra III/Celesta light source (with excitation wavelengths of 405, 477, 546, and 638 nm). This microscope was controlled through NIS Elements software.\nChemical hood for preparing paraformaldehyde solutions\nTissue culture hood for seeding mammalian cells (any Class II Type A2 Biological Safety Cabinet)\nA humidified incubator set to 37°C + 5% CO2\n1. Seed cells into imaging plates or dishes.\nFollow your preferred protocol for seeding cells, choosing a seeding time that ensures that the cells are displaying the desired behaviors during imaging. In our example, the day before the experiment, we lifted cells from a subconfluent 25-cm2 culture flask using 200 μl of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA. Once detached, cells were suspended in 1000 μl of medium, and 20 μl of this suspension were added to wells of a 96-well plate containing 150 μl/well of medium. We then allowed the cells to settle for ∼24 hr in an incubator at 37°C, with 5% CO2. We recommend seeding at least 10 wells during initial optimization of new cell lines to allow for troubleshooting. Cells can also be seeded into other types of dishes or plates, provided that they are suitable for imaging. For optimal optics, we recommend glass coverslip-bottom dishes.\n2. Prepare a “2×” OneStep solution on the day of the experiment.",
    "If the protocol has not yet been optimized for your desired cell type, make up a few different formulations of OneStep solution, varying the concentration of paraformaldehyde (PFA) and detergent (Triton X-100 or NP-40 Alternative). As a starting point, we recommend testing the concentrations you typically use for fixing and staining, keeping in mind that the fixatives/detergents/dyes will need to be at twice their final concentrations (“2×”) because the OneStep mixture will be added to an equal volume of buffer and cells in the well. For example, if you typically use a fixation buffer of PBS + 3.7% PFA, a permeabilization buffer of PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100, and a staining solution of 1 μg/ml DAPI + 66 nM labeled phalloidin in PBS, make up a solution of: 1× PBS + 7.4% PFA + 0.2% Triton X-100, 2 μg/ml DAPI, and 132 nM labeled phalloidin. Also make up formulations with higher and/or lower concentrations of PFA and Triton X-100 (we have found that lower levels of detergent are usually more effective—here, 0.05% Triton X-100 was optimal).\n3. Gently aspirate the medium out of the wells.\nPipette or aspirate the medium out of the corner of the well while tilting the plate slightly to remove as much medium as possible without dislodging the cells.\n4. Gently add 150 μl of PBS to each well.",
    "Do this immediately following step 3, so as not to let the cells dry out (this is critical). If your cell type does not tolerate PBS, test your preferred buffer. For long-term imaging of mammalian cells, we recommend waiting until step 5, then gently removing medium and replacing it with PBS on the microscope before step 6, or testing a buffer (other than the growth medium) that is preferable for longer incubations (e.g., HBSS). If you seeded cells into a different type of dish, add an amount of buffer up to half of the volume you typically use for that dish/well type.\n5. Begin imaging the cells using fluorescence and DIC or phase/contrast microscopy as a time series.\nBe sure to use the appropriate filters for the dyes you are using. In our example, we used DAPI and TRITC fluorescence channels. After imaging the first well, optimize the exposure settings before moving to the next well. We recommend a time window of 5-20 s between frames.\n6. After a few minutes (or as long as you would like to observe the live cells), add 150 μl of the appropriate OneStep solution to the imaging well. Continue imaging until you are satisfied with the staining intensity. We typically image until the fluorescence signal plateaus.\nWhen the time series is complete, it can be helpful to image the cells as a z-stack to observe structures outside of the initial focal plane. See Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.308#cpz1308-fig-0001] for examples of representative time points and maximum intensity projections of z-stacks, and Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.308#cpz1308-fig-0002] for additional cell types.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/37354e41-daba-4c54-b447-93f3a5412cd8/cpz1308-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "OneStep fixing and staining is adaptable to different cell types. (A) Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and (B) Naegleria gruberi cells were imaged prior to treatment (before and including t = 0), and throughout the fixation/staining process, during which the 2× solution was added to an equal volume of cells in water. Representative cells are shown 30 and 60 s after the addition of the OneStep solution. DAPI staining of DNA is shown in magenta, and phalloidin staining of actin polymer is shown in cyan. Naegleria gruberi cells were treated with MitoTracker™ Red (displayed in yellow) prior to imaging."
