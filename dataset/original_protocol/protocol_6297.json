    "Substrate fabricationPolyacrylamide gels are prepared as adapted from protocols in literature (Tse and Engler, 2010; Wen et al., 2014).Silanization of glass bottom dishes. This functionalizes the glass surface so that the polyacrylamide hydrogel will covalently bind to it. Add 250 μl of a 0.2 N NaOH solution to the glass area of each glass bottom dish. Ensure NaOH solution coats entire glass area but not the plastic surface as shown in Figure 1A.Incubate on a gently rocking shaker for 1 h.Rinse dishes 3 times with deionized water (dH2O). Use compressed, filtered air to dry the dishes. Bake the dishes at 80 °C on aluminum foil on a hot plate until completely dry. Overheating the dishes may cause adhesive on the glass to fail. Add 0.2 ml of 3-(Trimethoxysilyl) Propyl Methacrylate (3-TPM) to 9.8 ml of 100% ethanol.Apply 100 ul of 3-TPM solution to the glass area of each dish. Ensure 3-TPM solution coats entire glass area but not the plastic surface as shown in Figure 1A.Incubate on a gently rocking shaker for 30 min.Add 3 ml of ethanol to each dish. Incubate on a gently rocking shaker for 5 min. Remove ethanol. Use compressed air to dry the dishes. Bake the dishes at 80 °C on aluminum foil on a hot plate until completely dry. Note: At this stage, silanized glass bottom dishes can be stored for up to one month in a dark, dry location. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191030/20191030203954_5646.jpgFigure 1.

    "The polyacrylamide gel provides the deformable hydrogel substrate for cells to bind to as part of TFM preparation.Prepare a polyacrylamide pre-polymer solution based on desired stiffness (Recipe 3). You will need 20 μl of solution for each dish. Add 0.1 g of Irgacure 2959 (light-sensitive) to 0.5 ml 100% methanol to produce a 20% w/v Irgacure solution. Vortex until solution is clear.Combine the pre-polymer solution and Irgacure solution at a 9:1 ratio. Prepare enough. Sonicate the bead suspension for 15 min.Add beads to the working solution at a 1:500 ratio (i.e., 1 μl bead solution to 500 μl working solution). Vortex to ensure complete mixing. Degas the full working solution in a vacuum desiccator for 15 min. Pipette 20 μl of the working solution into the center a glass bottom dish. Avoid bubbles in the droplet as shown in Figure 1B.Carefully float a 12 mm coverslip onto the droplet. The solution should spread the edges of the droplet as shown in Figure 1C. Repeat with the remaining dishes.Invert the dishes, as shown in Figure 1D, and let stand for 15 min to allow beads to migrate towards the surface.Expose dishes to 365 nM UVA for 15 min in the UV crosslinker. Fill dishes with deionized water as shown in Figure 1E. Let sit for 3-24 h. Carefully remove coverslips using forceps. Avoid twisting or shearing the coverslip which may cause ripping in the gel surface.Note: Use of clean coverslips and careful removal after 24 h of soaking in dH2O typically results in successful removal of the coverslip without damaging the gel. For very soft gels, it may be necessary to further passivate the coverslip surface. Strategies include wiping the surface with Rain‑X® using a delicate task wiper, or vapor deposition of Dichlorodimethylsilane.",
    "Dehydrate gels at 50 °C on a hot plate until all water has evaporated from the gel. A dehydrated gel is shown in Figure 1A. Gel dishes can be stored for up to one month in a dark, dry location. Microarray printing This process prints an array of circular spots of biomolecules onto the polyacrylamide substrates. These array spots are where cells will adhere forming circular islands.If needed, prepare a suitable 2x printing buffer (Recipe 1) Note: ECM protein printing (ECMP) buffer is appropriate for most ECM molecules. Growth factor (GF) printing buffer is suitable for other classes of molecules such as growth factors or ligands, where a low pH could cause issues. Prepare a microarraying source plate.In a 384-well V-bottom microplate, prepare printing solutions which should include equal volumes of 2x printing buffer with biomolecule solution at double the target concentration. For many ECM proteins, 250 µg/m is a suitable concentration. Optimal concentrations will vary depending on the molecule, its retention, and its function. The total volume in each well should be between 5 and 15 µl. In your source plate, you should also include a solution with a fluorescent marker which will be used to convey the orientation of the array to determine the locations of each condition. We recommend rhodamine-conjugated dextran at a final concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. The source plate configuration will differ based on the arrayer, pin configuration, and desired array layout.Mix each well thoroughly by pipetting. Take care to avoid generating bubbles. Centrifuge the source microplate for 1 min at 1,000 x g. Source plates can be used immediately or stored at 4 °C for 1 day before until microarray fabrication. If storing, cover source plate with an adhesive seal. Clean and prepare pins according to the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "Load cleaned pins into the microarrayer printhead.Prepare the microarrayer and arraying program using the manufacturer’s software. The set-up and programming will differ based on the arrayer and desired array layout. The program should be devised such that the array orientation is unambiguous, and the locations of each arrayed conditions are known and could be determined by the location relative to the fluorescent marker in any orientation. An example of this is provided in Figure 2.Notes:The example array layout shown was designed for printing 6 replicates of 4 conditions, which were simultaneously printed by four SSP015 pins which produce 600 μm diameter islands. The number of islands and/or conditions can be scaled up when using pins that produce smaller islands. Be sure to record how the layout corresponds to the arrayed conditions. Include wash steps using both water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) between each condition in order to prevent carry-over and cross-contamination. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191030/20191030204041_3704.jpgFigure 2. Example layout of an array of 4 ECM conditions with dextran rhodamine markers. When the islands and dextran rhodamine spots are visible, the orientation of the array can be discerned whether rotated or if viewed from above or below.Turn on the humidifier and ensure it is adjusted to 65% RH (non-condensing). Wait until the rheometer matches the set point. Place the source plate in the arrayer in an appropriate adaptor.Dehydrate hydrogel substrates at 50 °C for 15 min. Protect from light due to the presence of the fluorescent beads. Place dishes into an appropriate adaptor. If the arrayer can fit a standard multiwell plate, the 6-well plate is suitable to hold the dishes.Note: See the note under Materials and Reagents #5.  Begin array fabrication. Check frequently that the humidity has not dropped below 65% RH (non-condensing).",
    "When the program is complete, store fabricated arrays covered with aluminum foil at room temperature and 65% RH (non-condensing) overnight. While the array spots are visible, it is helpful to visibly mark the top or bottom of the array so the orientation is known when placing on the microscope. For some hydrogel and pin combinations, it may be necessary to store arrays at ambient temperature and humidity for an additional two days to ensure arrays have dried completely. Arrays can be stored for up to 7 days before use. Seeding cells on microarraysHere cells are transferred from their normal culture condition on to the microarrayed hydrogel substrates for TFM.To sterilize the gels, add 3 ml of PBS with 1% v/v penicillin/streptomycin. Expose to UV C for 30 min. Exchange penicillin/streptomycin solution for cell culture media. Collect and count cells following the cell appropriate procedure. Resuspend cells in culture media at an appropriate concentration for seeding. This will differ based on cell type but will likely range between 170 x 103 and 7 x 105 cells/ml. Add 3 ml of cell suspension to each dish. Incubate dishes at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2-24 h, or until confluent cell islands have formed. Seeding density and time may need to be optimized for your cells and application. Agitation of the dishes every 15-60 min may also aid in forming consistent, confluent islands.Once islands have formed, rinse arrays twice with 3 ml prewarmed media. At this stage, add any experimental treatments such as growth factors or inhibitors. Change media every 1-2 days until time to perform TFM, or as your cell culture protocol suggests, maintaining any treatment concentrations at each exchange. Figure 3 shows an example of an array with cellular islands.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191030/20191030204121_5683.jpgFigure 3.",
    "35 mm glass bottom dish with cellular island array after 24 h of cultureAcquiring images for traction force microscopyPrepare a solution of 1% v/v bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1% v/v sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in PBS. This will be used to dissociate cells during image acquisition. The microscopy process will vary based on the microscope used, but the following steps should broadly apply. Some additional details are provided for use with Zeiss Zen software. The microscope should have a robotic stage and a chamber which provides incubation and humidity control which have been appropriately set and allowed to come to equilibrium. Place one dish on the stage of the inverted fluorescent microscope. It is helpful to use the mark provided after array fabrication to place the dish with the array’s XY axis approximately aligned along that of the microscope stage. Secure the dish in place so that it does not shift when the stage moves.Using the appropriate fluorescent channel, locate and mark (in the software) the XY positions of the fluorescent arrayed markers. In Zeiss Zen Blue 2, this is accomplished in the acquisition section by checking the tiles box and adding a single position for each island, as shown in Figure 4.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191030/20191030204143_2920.jpgFigure 4. Zeiss Zen Blue 2 environment. To mark locations, in acquisition, mark Tiles and enter advanced setup. Set individual island positions as shown by the yellow markers. The verify positions tool can be used to move through positions to set the Z position without altering the XY position. Using phase contrast or bright field, locate and mark the XY positions of the cell islands. Either imaging modality may be suitable as long as the image can provide the boundary of the cell island in subsequent analysis.",
    "Individually find and save the Z plane focus of each island. An example image phase contrast is shown in Figure 5A. The verify positions tool can be used to move through positions to set the Z position without altering the XY position. The saved XY positions of the islands can be saved and reused for subsequent dishes.Begin the automated imaging of the phase contrast images of the cell islands. Save this file with a suitable name that notes the experiment details as well as that it is the phase contrast image.Switch to the appropriate fluorescent channel for the beads. Individually find and save the Z plane focus of the top surface of the gel under each island. Take care to avoid changing the XY positions. Save this file with a suitable name that notes the experiment details as well as that it is the pre-dissociation image. An example image is shown in Figure 5B.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191030/20191030204207_5622.jpgFigure 5. Example images from TFM data collection. A. Phase contract image of a cellular island. Image should be clear enough to define island boundaries. B. Fluorescence image of the beads at the surface of the substrate under the island. Scale bar: 200 μm.Begin the automated imaging in the fluorescent channel of the pre-dissociation bead images. Save this file with the same experiment details as well as that it is the pre-dissociation image.Carefully add 150 µl of the SDS solution to the dish, taking care to not bump or move the dish. Monitor dissociation of the cell islands using the phase contrast channel. Wait until the islands have completely dissociated from the substrate at which time there the island locations, when viewed in phase contrast channel, should appear mostly blank. Note: Some cells may require addition of more SDS solution, or higher concentration.",
    "Additionally, Triton-X may be used instead.  Return to the island positions and using the fluorescent channel check that the beads at the top of the surface are still in focus. If the beads have moved out-of-plane due to relaxion of the cell induced deformation, correct and save the Z-coordinate of the focus plane but do not alter the XY positions. Repeat automated imaging of the islands to capture the post-dissociation images of the beads. The displacement of the beads will likely be difficult to discern, meaning the post-dissociation fluorescent bead image should appear very similar to the pre-dissociation image. Save this file with a suitable name that notes the experiment details as well as that it is the post-dissociation image.Repeat Steps D2-D9 for each dish."
