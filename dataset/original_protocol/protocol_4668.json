    "Bacterial inoculum preparation and inoculationStreak out each Xcv strain from -80 °C glycerol stocks using a sterilized toothpick onto an independent sterile NYGA agar plate with appropriate antibiotics and grow for 2 d in a 28 °C incubator.For each strain analyzed, suspend a portion of the bacterial cells from the agar plate using a sterilized toothpick or pipet tip in 1 ml of 10 mM MgCl2 in a 1.5 ml microtube. Vortex the cell suspension well and check its optical density at 600 nm (OD600) by using a spectrophotometer. To prepare the inoculum, dilute the cell suspension with 10 mM MgCl2 to obtain an OD600 = 0.2. (Different inoculum concentrations should be empirically tested for optimal ethylene production.) Inoculate each leaflet of middle leaves with 10 mM MgCl2 (mock inoculation) or a bacterial inoculum using a 1 ml needleless syringe (Figure 1). Carefully remove excess solution on the surface of the leaflet with tissue paper. Use leaflets on the same branch for comparison to control for leaf age. For statistical analysis, prepare a minimum of three biological replicates.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160205/20160205151747_0612.jpgFigure 1. Hand infiltration with needless syringeMove the inoculated plants into a plant growth chamber or greenhouse (~ 25-28 °C, 16 h day/8 h night cycle).Ethylene gas measurementAt 0, 2, and 3 days post-inoculation (dpi), excise the leaflets (mock or Xcv-infected) and measure their weight. Roll each leaflet and then place it into a glass tube (16 mm diameter x 100 mm) for 30 min without sealing. Then cap each glass tube with a Suba-Seal Septa stopper (Figure 2). Note: It is important to use the smallest size glass tube to reduce the volume of the gas space to concentrate the ethylene emitted by each leaflet.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160205/20160205151803_4880.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Rolled leaflet in a glass tube capped with a septa stopperIncubate the glass tubes for 1 h at room temperature.Using a 25 gauge needle attached to a 1 ml syringe, remove 1 ml of the gas sample from each glass tube (Figure 3) and inject it into a gas chromatograph.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160205/20160205151816_3424.jpgFigure 3. Gas sampling from a glass tube capped with a septa stopperUse company instruction manual to detect ethylene [e.g., Shimadzu's GC instruction manual (https://store.shimadzu.com/p-52629-instruction-manualgc-8apfgc-8a.aspx[href=https://store.shimadzu.com/p-52629-instruction-manualgc-8apfgc-8a.aspx])].Measuring ethylene using a standard curveUse the needle attachment on the 1% ethylene can to pump ethylene gas into a Tedlar bag. Label bag as standard 1. Final concentration of standard 1 = 1% = 10,000 nl of ethylene/ml.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160205/20160205151830_2264.jpgFigure 4. Pumping ethylene gas into a Tedlar bagTake 1 ml of 1% ethylene from the ethylene-filled Tedlar bag and inject it into a capped glass tube (18 mm diameter x 150 mm glass tube with Suba-seal septa). Label tube as standard 2. Final concentration of standard 2 = 0.0352% or 352 nl of ethylene/ml. (An empty capped tube contains 27.4 ml of air. Ethylene concentration in standard 2 = 1% /1 ml + 27.4 ml.)Take 1 ml from capped glass tube (standard 2; 18 mm diameter x 150 mm glass tube with Suba-seal septa) and inject it into a capped tube labeled standard 3 (18 mm diameter x 150 mm glass tube with Suba-seal septa). Final concentration of standard 3 = 0.00124% or 12.4 nl of ethylene/ml.Inject 1 ml of each standard on the GC and determine the peak area.Construct a standard curve by plotting the peak area (X-axis) by nl of ethylene (Y-axis).Using the standard curve, determine the level of ethylene in each inoculated leaflet. Ethylene levels are defined as nl of ethylene/gram of fresh weight/hour. Representative results can be found in Lund et al.",
