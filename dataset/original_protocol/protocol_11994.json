    "1. Id1 Virus Preparation and Infection\nGenerate Id1 overexpressing lentivirus by co-transfecting pCMVDR8.74, pMD2.G, and pCDH-EF1-Id1-PGK-PuroR (Addgene: plasmid #107735) into HEK293T cells. Collect viral particles, filtrate, purify from the supernatant, and store at -80 °C as in Kitamura et al. (2003)19. Alternatively, produce Id1 lentivirus commercially by sending pCDH-EF1-Id1-PGK-PuroR to a lentivirus-producing vendor.\n\tCaution: Please follow lentiviral safety regulations and standard operation protocols.\n\tNote: IMPORTANT: Optimal virus titer should be at least 108 to 109 Transducing Units/mL (TU/mL).\nPrior to infection, coat one well of a 96 well plate with 50 µl of coating reagent, typically a gelatinous protein mixture secreted by Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma cells (see Table of Materials).\nDissociate one well of pluripotent stem cells grown in a 6 well plate by adding 1 mL of PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and with 0.5 mM EDTA.\n\tNOTE: Dissociation time varies from 3–10 min. When more than 80% of the cells are detached from the bottom of the plate, proceed to next step.\nCollect cell suspension with sterile pipet into 15 mL plastic centrifuge tube.\nNeutralize dissociation reagent with 5 mL of PBS-containing Ca2+ and Mg2+.\nPellet cells by centrifugation (200 x g for 3 min).\nRemove supernatant and gently flick the tube in order to dislodge the pellet.\nRe-suspend cells in 1 mL of stem cell media.\nCount cells using an automated cell counter following vendor instructions.\nPlate 20,000 viable cells per coated well (96-well plate) in 50 µL of stem cell media supplemented with 2 µM RHO/ROCK pathway inhibitor (see Tables 1 and 2).\nAfter 24 h, monitor for cell attachment and replace media with 100 µl stem cell media supplemented with 2 µM RHO/ROCK pathway inhibitor and 6 ng/mL hexadimethrine bromide (see Tables 1 and 2), one h prior to lentiviral infection.",
    "NOTE: Cells should be firmly attached to the bottom of the plate.\nThaw Id1-lentivirus on ice.\nAdd 3 µL of purified lentivirus per well (virus titer should be between 108 to 109 TU/mL), and then transfer the plate back to cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 20% O2).\n24 h post-viral infection, add 100 µL of fresh stem cell media to infected cells.\n48 h post-lentiviral infection, replace virus containing media with 200 µL of fresh stem cell media supplemented with 1 µg/mL puromycin.\nRefresh media daily with 200 µL of stem cell media supplemented with 1 µg/mL puromycin.\nWhen cultures reach 80% confluency, dissociate cells using 200 µL of PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ + 0.5 mM EDTA (for one well of a 96-well plate).\nCollect cell suspension into a centrifuge tube.\nNeutralize dissociation reagent with 5 mL of PBS-containing Ca2+ and Mg2+.\nPellet cells by centrifugation (200 x g for 3 min).\nRemove supernatant and gently flick the tube in order to dislodge the pellet.\nRe-suspend cells in 1 mL of stem cell media supplemented with 2 µM RHO/ROCK pathway inhibitor.\nTransfer all cells (1 mL) to a coated well of a 12-well plate.\nAfter 24 h, monitor for cell attachment to the well and replace media with 1 mL of stem cell media supplemented with 2 µM RHO/ROCK pathway inhibitor and 6 ng/mL hexadimethrine bromide, one h prior to transduction.\nThaw Id1-lentivirus on ice.\nAdd 5 µL of purified virus per well (12-well plate).\n24 h post-lentiviral infection, replace virus containing media with 1 mL of fresh stem cell media supplemented with 3 µg/mL puromycin.\n48 h post lentiviral infection, replace virus containing media with 1 mL of fresh stem cell media supplemented with 6 µg/mL puromycin.",
    "When cultures reach 80% confluency, dissociate cells using 500 µL of PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and with 0.5 mM EDTA (for one well of a 12-well plate).\nTransfer half (250 µL) of the cell suspension to one well of a coating reagent coated 6-well plate containing 2 mL of stem cell media supplemented with 2 µM RHO/ROCK pathway inhibitor.\nUse the other half (250 µL) of the sample for RNA extraction and qRT-PCR in order to determine lentiviral-mediated Id1 expression levels, as in Colas et al. (2012)4.\n\tNOTE: IMPORTANT: If Id1 mRNA expression levels are lower than 0.005 fold of GAPDH expression levels (see Table 3 for qRT-PCR primers), repeat infection process as described above until Id1 expression levels exceed the threshold.\n2. hPSCsId1 Maintenance\nCulture hPSCsId1 in coated 6 well-plates and grow in 3 mL per well of stem cell media supplemented with 6 µg/mL puromycin.\nWhen hPSCsId1 reach 80% confluency, passage cells as aggregates (1:6 split ratio) using enzyme-free dissociation reagent following vendor guidelines and grow in 3 mL per well of stem cell media supplemented with 6 µg/mL puromycin.\n3. Preparation of hPSCsId1  for Differentiation\nCoat a 12-well plate with 500 µL per well of coating reagent.\nWhen hPSCsId1 reach 90% confluency dissociate cells by adding 1 mL of PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and with 0.5 mM EDTA per well for 5–10 min. Check dissociation process every minute, and once 80% of the cells are dissociated from the plate, proceed to the next step.\nCollect cell suspension into a centrifuge tube.\nNeutralize dissociation reagent with 5 mL of PBS-containing Ca2+ and Mg2+.\nPellet cells by centrifugation (200 x g for 3 min).\nRemove supernatant and gently flick the tube in order to dislodge the pellet.",
    "Re-suspend cells in 2 mL of stem cell media supplemented with 2 µM RHO/ROCK pathway inhibitor.\nCount cells using an automated cell counter.\nPlate 300,000 cells per well in 1 mL of stem cell media supplemented with 2 µM RHO/ROCK pathway inhibitor and 6 µg/mL puromycin, and transfer plate into tissue culture incubator.\nRefresh media daily with 2 mL of stem cell media supplemented with 6 µg/mL puromycin until cultures reach 90% confluency. At this point, initiate cardiac differentiation (next step).\n4. Differentiation of hPSCsId1 into First Heart Field-like Cardiac Progenitors (FHF-L CPs)\nFor 12-well plate format, initiate differentiation (day 0) by replacing stem cell media with 1.5 mL of induction media (Table 1) supplemented with Activin A (100 ng/mL) (see Table 2 for recommended volumes and Activin A concentrations for different plate formats).\nOn day 1 (24 h after differentiation is initiated), replace media with 2 mL of induction media without Activin A (per well of a 12-well plate).\nOn day 3, replace media with 2 mL of induction media without Activin A (per well of a 12-well plate).\nOn day 5, collect FHF-L CPs for cryopreservation (next step).\n\tNOTE: IMPORTANT: Cryopreservation is preferred at this point, as it enables to uncouple cardiac progenitor generation from subsequent cardiomyocyte production and biobank large batches of cells. Note that alternatively, day 5 FHF-L CPs can be passed to a freshly coated plate to continue differentiation, please refer to Steps 5.1–5.5 to passFHF-L CPs and then proceed to Step 6.5 for differentiation.\n5. Cryopreservation of FHF-L CPs\nAspirate all media from wells containing day 5 FHF-L CPs and quickly add 1 mL of warm (37 °C) 1x enzyme-containing dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials). Place plate in the tissue culture incubator.\nAfter 1 min, shake plate side to side in the incubator.",
    "After 2 min (total time), remove plate from the incubator and add 1 mL of 10% FBS media.\nGently pipet cells up and down with a 5 mL pipet to facilitate cell detachment from the plate.\nCollect cell suspension to a centrifuge tube and pellet cells by centrifugation at 200 x g for 3 min\nRe-suspend cell pellet in 2 mL of cryopreservation reagent.\nCount cells using an automated cell counter.\nAdd cryopreservation reagent (see Table of Materials) at a sufficient volume to cryopreserve cells at desired concentration (typically 5–10 x 106 cells/mL).\nTransfer cells to cryopreservation vials and place vials in cooling device (1 °C/min) and place cooling device in -80 °C freezer overnight.\nAfter 24 h, transfer frozen vials to liquid nitrogen for long term storage.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here.\n6. FHF-L CP Differentiation Into Ventricular-like Cardiomyocytes\nTransfer day 5 FHF-L CPs frozen vials from liquid nitrogen storage into dry ice container.\nPlace vials in 37 °C water bath for 2 to 3 min, until cell suspension is thawed completely.\n\tNOTE: IMPORTANT: The thawing process is time-sensitive. Exposing cells to the cryopreservation media for an excessive amount of time (i.e., 10 min) will decrease cell viability.\nTransfer cells to 15 or 50 mL centrifuge tube, depending on the number of thawed vials.\nDispense dropwise (5 drops every 30 seconds) pre-warmed (37 °C) cardiogenic media (Table 1) to cell solution. Continue this process until a 1:3 cryopreservation media:cardiogenic media ratio is reached. At this point, increase the cardiogenic media addition rate until a 1:10 cryopreservation media:cardiogenic media ratio is reached.\n\tNOTE: IMPORTANT: Rapid osmolarity changes will increase cell death during the thawing process; therefore, dropwise addition of cardiogenic media as described above is highly recommended.",
    "Centrifuge cell suspension and pellet cells by centrifugation (200 x g for 3 min).\nRemove supernatant and gently flick centrifuge tube to dislodge cell pellet.\nRe-suspend cells with cardiogenic media supplemented with 2 µM RHO/ROCK pathway inhibitor.\n\tNote: Cell viability can vary from thaw to thaw, and, in general, > 65% viability predicts good plating efficiency.\nDilute concentrated cell suspension with cardiogenic media supplemented with 2 µM RHO/ROCK pathway inhibitor to obtain the desired cell concentration for plating (see Table 2 for different plate formats).\n\tNOTE: IMPORTANT: Note that cardiac differentiation efficiency may decline if cells are seeded too sparsely.\nSeed cells on plate.\nKeep plate in the tissue culture hood for 20 min before transferring it to tissue culture incubator.\nOn day 6 of differentiation, monitor cell attachment.\n\tNOTE: Cardiac progenitors are cryopreserved on day 5 of the differentiation. 24 h after thawing the cells would be on day 6 of the differentiation.\n\tNOTE: The presence of floating (dead) cells is common.\nOn day 7, aspirate 50% of the media and replace with an equal amount of fresh cardiogenic media.\n\tNOTE: The addition of RHO/ROCK pathway inhibitor to the cardiogenic media is not necessary after this point.\nReplace 50% of the media with cardiogenic media every other day.\nNote spontaneous beating that appears between day 11 and day 13.\nOn day 15, quantify cardiac differentiation efficiency by immunofluorescence using DAPI (nucleus stain) and ACTC1 (pan-cardiac marker).\n7. Passing and Maintenance of Ventricular-like Cardiomyocytes\nNOTE: By day 14–16, a monolayer of spontaneously contracting ventricular-like cardiomyocytes should be obtained. At this point, it is suggested to dissociate and re-plate cardiomyocytes in order to homogenize the culture and prevent cells from detaching from the plate.",
    "Aspirate all media from wells and quickly add 1 mL of pre-warmed (37 °C) 1x enzyme-containing dissociation reagent.\n\tNOTE: 1x enzyme-containing dissociation reagent volumes vary depending on plate format, but should completely cover the bottom of the well surface.\nTransfer plate into a tissue culture incubator.\nGently shake plate side to side every 2 min inside the incubator to accelerate the detachment process.\nAfter 5–15 min, when 80% to 100% of the cells are detached from the bottom of the plate, remove the plate from the incubator and inhibit 1x enzyme-containing dissociation reagent activity by adding an equal volume of 10% FBS media.\n\tNOTE: Incubation time with 1x enzyme-containing dissociation for this process will vary from batch-to-batch.\nCollect cell suspension to a centrifuge tube.\nMix cell suspension with pipet and count cells using an automated cell counter.\nDilute cell suspension to desired cell concentration (see Table 2 for different plate formats) with maintenance media supplemented with 2 µM RHO/ROCK pathway inhibitor.\nAfter seeding cardiomyocytes onto the plate, distribute the cells evenly and allow the cells to attach for 10–20 min before transferring plate to tissue culture incubator.\n24 h after re-plating, monitor cell attachment and recovery.\n\tNOTE: The presence of floating (dead) cells is common. 48–72 h after re-plating, cardiomyocyte should resume spontaneous contraction.\nTo maintain cardiomyocyte culture, replace 50% of the media with the maintenance media every other day until use of ventricular-like cardiomyocytes for subsequent experiments.\nSubscription Required.
