    "Transformation of E. coli cells with plasmid the pGEX-6P-1-KaiCPlace the calcium competent BL21(DE3) cells and the pGEX-6P-1-KaiC plasmid in ice water. Measure the plasmid concentration spectrophotometrically and add 0.1 µg of pGEX-6P-1-KaiC into 100 µl of BL21(DE3) cells in a 1.5 ml tube. Mix the plasmid and the cells gently and set down in ice water for 30 min. Place the tube in a 42 °C water bath for 90 sec before placing it in ice water for 60 sec.Add 400 µl of LB (Luria-Bertani) medium (without antibiotics) to the tube, and let the cells recover in a shaker at 37 °C, 150 rpm for 45 min. Spin down the cells at 6,000 x g (30 sec).Discard supernatant and re-suspend cells in 100 µl of fresh LB medium (without antibiotics). Spread cells evenly on solid LB medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml of ampicillin.Incubate the plate at 37 °C overnight until colonies form.Expression of KaiCPick a single colony of the transformed BL21(DE3) cells containing pGEX-6P-1-KaiC and inoculate it into 3 ml liquid LB medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml of ampicillin in a sterilized 15 ml tube. Grow the cells overnight at 37 °C, 220 rpm. Transfer 1 ml of the overnight culture to 1 L of sterilized liquid LB medium containing 100 µg/ml of ampicillin in a 3 L flask. Grow culture until OD600 reaches ~0.6 at 37 °C, 220 rpm, lower the temperature to 28 °C and induce the expression of kaiC by adding 200 µl of 1 M IPTG. After 16 h of induction, collect the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 7,000 x g, 4 °C. Keep the pelleted cells on ice for instant processing or store at -80 °C.",
    "GST affinity purificationRe-suspend the cells from 1 L cell culture thoroughly with 40 ml of PSP buffer in a 100 ml glass beaker. Place the beaker in ice water, and disrupt the cells by sonication for 45 min at 35% output power (wait for 2 sec after every 1 sec of sonication). Transfer the solution to a fresh 50 ml tube, and centrifuge for 40 min at 4 °C, 16,000 x g. During the centrifugation, take 1 ml of the GST resin and wash it with 5 ml of sterilized ddH2O and then 3 ml of PSP buffer. Mix the GST resin on an orbital shaker with the supernatant from the centrifuge tube (step C3) for 2 h at 4 °C. Re-suspend the resin with 5 ml of PSP buffer (4 °C) and elute the buffer to remove unbound proteins. Add the PreScission protease to the resin and keep the solution at 4 °C for 16 h to allow the enzymatic digestion of the GST-tagged KaiC. Keep the supernatant (or the eluent) containing KaiC at 4 °C for further purification steps.Notes: Use an orbital shaker (40 rpm) when incubating the resin mixture at 4 °C.Store 10 µl of the sample at each step (including the steps in the following anion exchange purification) for evaluation for the first time at -20 °C. Anion exchange purificationSet up the FPLC machine and turn on the 280 nm UV lights for detection. Install a 5 ml Hitrap FF Q column on the FPLC machine, and wash it with 25 ml of ddH2O and then 25 ml of buffer A at 4.0 ml/min. Exchange buffer of the KaiC protein from the last step with buffer A using a NAP-25 buffer exchange column, and load the sample onto the column at 2.0 ml/min.",
    "Wash the column with buffer A until the absorbance at 280 nm reaches the baseline. Wash the column with 10% buffer B (90% buffer A) to remove non-specifically bound proteins. Set up a linear gradient elution program with 10-50% buffer B for 70 min, and collect the protein peak (~ 40 min) which contains KaiC. Keep the KaiC sample at 4 °C.Notes: All buffers and samples used for FPLC purification must be filtered through 0.22 µm filters. The linear gradient elution step is strongly recommended for the first purification trial. Storage of KaiCTo store the purified KaiC protein, concentrate the KaiC sample from the last step (step D7) to 1-5 mg/ml with a 10 kDa centrifugal filter at 4 °C, 3,000 rpm. Exchange buffer with reaction buffer using a NAP-5 buffer exchange column. Concentrate the KaiC sample to 1-5 mg/ml, and store the protein at -80 °C.Notes:  Determine the concentration of the sample with the Bradford assay. We suggest using the protein immediately for the following procedures. For storage add 20% glycerol, freeze in liquid nitrogen and keep at -80 °C. Please note that long-term storage (2-3 months) might result in an activity loss of KaiC.Preparation of KaiC samples for SDS-PAGE analysisTake out the KaiC protein stored at -80 °C and thaw on ice. Dilute KaiC to 0.5 mg/ml with reaction buffer supplemented with 80 µg/ml of kanamycin to a final volume of 30 µl. Transfer 4 µl of the diluted KaiC sample to clean and sterilized PCR tubes labelled as tubes 1 to 5. Add 2 µl of 3x loading dye to sample tube 1 and incubate at 100 °C for 5 min. Store sample 1 at -20 °C and transfer samples 2-5 to 4 °C. After 24 h, take out sample 2 and prepare as described above.",
    "Place the sample tubes 3-5 in a PCR machine, and set the sample temperature to 30 °C. Take out one tube every 4 h and prepare as described before.SDS-PAGE analysis of the auto-phosphatase activity of KaiCTake out the KaiC protein stored at -80 °C and thaw on ice. Dilute KaiC to 0.5 mg/ml with reaction buffer supplemented with 80 µg/ml of kanamycin to a final volume of 30 µl. Transfer 4 µl of the diluted KaiC sample to clean and sterilized PCR tubes labelled as tubes 1 to 5. Add 2 µl of 3x loading dye to sample tube 1 and incubate at 100 °C for 5 min. Store sample 1 at -20 °C and transfer samples 2-5 to 4 °C. After 24 h, take out sample 2 and prepare as described above. Place the sample tubes 3-5 in a PCR machine, and set the sample temperature to 30 °C. Take out one tube every 4 h and prepare as described before.Notes: The best amount of KaiC in each well is 2-3 µg in this protocol. Add 10 µl of the loading dye in the wells beside the samples to reduce the ‘smile effect’."
