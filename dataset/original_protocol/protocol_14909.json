    "NOTE: All animals used in this procedure are treated in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research as well as the guidelines set down by the animal oversight committee at Saint Louis University.\nNOTE: All surgical instruments and solutions are sterilized prior to surgery to limit microbial infection of the eye. It should be noted that while the animals do experience some pain from this procedure, we do not employ analgesics.  The reason for this is because all analgesics are anti-inflammatory and since corneal transplantation responses involve inflammation, the use of anti-inflammatory drugs would compromise our ability to determine what factors are involved in corneal graft failure.\n1. Anesthesia\nPlace donor and recipient mice under general anesthesia by IP injections of ketamine (86.98 mg/kg) and xylazine (13.04 mg/kg).\nKeep the recipient mouse under anesthesia throughout the procedure which typically takes 30 min to an hr. Consequently, constantly monitor the mouse for any signs of regaining consciousness.\nApply puralube ointment to the eye that will not undergo surgery after the animal is anesthetized to prevent dryness.\n2. Corneal Grafting\nObtaining the donor corneal button.\n\t\nOnce the animal is fully anesthetized, achieve adequate mydriasis by administration of a couple of eye drops of 1% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine hydrochloride.\nPosition the head of the donor animal horizontally on a board placed on a sturdy movable support. Fix the head with a strip of tape across the neck to ensure that the eye is in a horizontal position throughout the entire operation.\nUsing a 2 mm diameter trephine, whose tip was dyed with methyl blue, outline the central cornea graft site.",
    "With a sharp blade, penetrate the cornea and inject healon into the anterior chamber to deepen it to reduce the chance of damage to the donor endothelium and underlying lens.\nExcise the donor graft with vannas scissors and place into a dish containing Hanks’ balanced salt solution until use.\nAfter the donor graft has been the removed, euthanize the donor mouse via CO2 inhalation.\nPreparing the graft bed.\n\t\nRepeat the same steps as described in 2.1.1 through 2.1.2 for the recipient.\nUsing a 1.5 mm diameter trephine, outline the recipient graft site.\nWith a sharp blade, penetrate the cornea and inject healon into the anterior chamber to deepen it to reduce the chance of damage to the underlying lens.\nRemove the outlined central corneal button from the recipient using vannas scissors and discard.\nSuturing the graft\n\t\nPlace the donor cornea over the graft bed in the recipient’s cornea. Be sure that adequate healon is under the donor cornea to protect the donor endothelial cells from damage by direct contact with lens.\nUsing super fine tipped microforceps, place the first bite of 11-0 nylon suture into the donor side, through the donor with 90% depth of full thickness to recipient’s side, then tie off.\nOnce the cornea is anchored in place, perform midcardinal interrupted sutures such that the cornea has 8 to 10 total sutures and the donor cornea is securely lined up with and attached to the recipient corneal graft bed.\nDeepening the anterior chamber\n\t\nDeepen the anterior chamber by injecting HBSS or air bubble into the anterior chamber and gently check the integrity of the corneal graft for leakage with a cellulose sponge.",
    "NOTE: If the anterior chamber cannot be reformed then there is a high probability of cataract which will make future evaluations of the transplanted cornea very difficult and will also potentially lead to donor corneal endothelium dysfunction and thus graft failure.\nFinal evaluation\n\t\nObserve the eye to determine that the pupil is round and the depth of the anterior chamber is normal.\n\t\tNOTE: If the pupil is not round this indicates that during suturing the iris was damaged and thus the graft is considered a technical failure.\nApply antibiotic ointment to the eye. Optional: Close the eye lid with a 7-0 silk suture.\nObserve mice until they are fully awake and then individually house them for a minimum of two days post-surgery.\n3. Suture Removal\nIn those cases where lid suture is used, anesthetize mice as described above and remove the lid suture at 48 hr.\nAnesthetize mice on day 7 postoperatively. Remove the sutures securing the corneal graft. Once the sutures are removed and the animal has fully awakened, return it to its cage.\n4. Clinical Evaluation\nExamine the eye for indications of procedural complications which include, cataract (clouding of the lens), hyphema (blood in the anterior chamber), an anterior chamber that is not of the proper depth, or significant opacity of the cornea. Consider those that demonstrate these complications as “compromised” and euthanize them by CO2 inhalation.\n\t\nPerform all examinations on unanesthetized mice. Hold the mouse with one hand thus restraining the mouse so that the other hand can proptose the eye to enable a better view of the eye. Once observations are completed, return the animal to its cage.",
    "Have an observer unfamiliar with the treatment groups evaluate transplanted corneas 2 to 3 times a week for signs of corneal graft rejection episodes or corneal graft failure. Use either the surgical microscope or a horizontal slit-lamp biomicroscope for these observations.\n\t\nEvaluate every cornea for opacity using a scale of 0 to 5. The scale is defined as follows:\n\t\t\nAssign a score of 0 to those corneas that have no signs of opacity.\nAssign a score of 1 to those corneas that show minimal superficial opacity.\nAssign a score of 2 to corneas that display mild and deeper opacity but the underlying pupil and iris are still discernable.\nAssign a score of 3 to cornea that display stromal opacity wherein the iris cannot be seen in detail with the exception of the pupil margins.\nAssign a score of 4 to cornea that display dense stromal opacity and if no underlying structures can be viewed.\nAssign a score of 5 to cornea that display complete opacity and intensive stromal edema, with pupil and iris totally obscured.\nAlso evaluate every cornea for the degree of blood vessel infiltration (neovascularization) using a rating scale of 1 to 8. To accomplish this, view the cornea as consisting of 4 equal quadrants and determine the amount of blood vessels in each of these quadrants with a score that will range from 0 (no vessels) to 2 for extensive vascularization of that quadrant. Add the individual scores from each quadrant to calculate the final neovascularization score.\nClassify corneas as acutely rejected if they have a score of 3 for two consecutive observations for time points up to 5 weeks.",
    "Classify mice whose corneas were clear at 5 weeks but develop opacification at times >45 days post engraftment, with a score of 3 for two consecutive time points, as having undergone late-term corneal allograft rejection. Use Kaplan-Meier survival curves to analyze graft survival.\n5. Manipulation of the Model\nPreparation of single cells from the spleen.\n\t\nTo prepare single cells, first euthanize the donor mouse. Then, remove the spleen.\nPlace the spleen in a cell strainer and disrupt it with a syringe plunger from a 3 ml syringe.\nWash cells and resuspend in 10 ml of Hanks Balanced Salt Solution.\nRemove 10 μl of cell suspension and add to 10 μl of 0.4% trypan blue and mix. Add that to hemocytometer and count the cells in the central grid. The number of cells in tube is the cell count x 104 x 2 (dilution factor in trypan blue) x 10 (volume in the tube).\nInjection into the anterior chamber.\n\t\nAnesthetize mice as previously described.\nPerform injections using a dissecting microscope. For each intracameral injection, use 106 spleen cells in a 0.005 ml volume and a 0.25 ml microliter syringe fitted with a 33 G needle.\n\t\tNOTE: Other manipulations of the model can be performed by treating animals with reagents that act as either antagonists or agonists to determine the role that a particular factor may play following orthotopic corneal allograft surgery.\nSubscription Required.
