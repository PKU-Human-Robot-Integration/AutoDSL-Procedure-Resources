    "All methods described in this section have been approved by the ethical committee of the Center for Human Movement Sciences of the University of Groningen (Register number: 201800904).\n1. Field test and inertial measurement unit preparation\nSet two cones at least 1 m from each other to determine the start of the field test.\n\tNOTE: The 1-m distance between the cones enables the subject to run easily through the starting point of the field test. This distance can be adjusted to the preference of the test leader.\nDetermine the end point of the field test by rolling measuring tape from the starting point of the test until a 30-m linear distance has been travelled.\nSet two cones at least 1 m from each other to determine the end point of the field test.\nPrepare the IMUs to get properly attached to the subject's body.\n\tNOTE: See Table of Materials for IMU dimensions and weight characteristics.\n\t\nCut stretch tape into 5 pieces the size of 10 cm x 10 cm.\nCut double-sided adhesive tape (e.g., toupee tape) into 5 pieces equal to the size of the IMUs that are used.\nAttach a piece of double-sided adhesive tape to each IMU.\nLabel each IMU, so that it can be recognized individually during data analysis.\n2. Subject preparation\nObtain information about the subject's gender, age, body weight, and height. Ask the subject to fill in a questionnaire about their background in team sports. Obtain written informed consent from subjects that meet the inclusion criteria.",
    "NOTE: Examples of questions: (i) For how many years do you play soccer? (ii) At which level do you play soccer? (iii) How many hours per week do you have soccer training during the past 6 months? (iv) What is your playing position? (v) Did you experience any pain or did you sustain a musculoskeletal injury at the lower extremity during the past 6 months?\nDetermine if the subject meets the inclusion criteria.\n\tNOTE: Include subjects when they did not experience any musculoskeletal injuries or pain in the lower extremities in the 6 months before executing the protocol; Subjects should have more than 1-year experience in competing team sports at amateur level.\nAsk the subject to change into sports clothing (e.g., a soccer shirt, soccer shorts and soccer shoes).\n\tNOTE: Because sensors will be placed on the tibia, soccer socks are unwanted.\nPrepare the IMUs for attaching to the subject's body.\n\t\nAlign all 5 IMUs next to each other.\nActivate all five IMUs at the same time by pushing a button on top of the sensor. The sensor is activated when a green light is blinking.\n\t\tNOTE: From this moment, each IMU samples data at 500 Hz. Data is stored on a SD card internally. Data has to be uploaded to a laptop or computer after the test has been completed.\nEnsure that a mechanical peak has been generated by tapping all IMUs on a hard surface at the same time (e.g., on a table).\n\t\tNOTE: The mechanical peak is needed for synchronizing the IMU signals. Synchronization of the IMU signals is performed during data processing (section 5). This section is not necessary when commercially available sensors are used. In that case, use the corresponding software to synchronize the sensors.\nAttach the IMUs to the subject's body (Figure 1).",
    "Shave the subject's body hair at the following anatomical locations: at the sacrum between both posterior superior iliac spines, the anteromedial bony part of both right and left tibia, and the lateral part of both right and left thigh (i.e., tractus illiotibialis).\n\t\tNOTE: The anatomical locations where sensors should be placed can be determined by palpation.\nSpray adhesive spray on the anatomical locations described in step 2.5.1. Wait 5−10 s to make sure the adhesive spray is dry.\n\t\tNOTE: Hold the spray at least 10 cm (4 inches) away from the skin and spray the desired area with a sweeping motion.\nRemove the protective layer of the double-sided adhesive tape from the IMUs.\nPlace the IMU at the described anatomical locations. Write down the anatomical location with the corresponding label of the IMU (e.g., right shank: IMU 1).\nAttach the stretching tape on top of each IMU to make sure the sensor is additionally secured to the skin.\n3. IMU sensor calibration\nInstruct the subject to stand still in a neutral position with their feet hip-width apart and their hands in their side. Maintain this position for a minimum period of 5 s.\nInstruct the subject to flex their left hip and knee to a 90° angle in the sagittal plane followed by extending the hip to their neutral position as described in step 3.1.\n\tNOTE: For definitions of kinematic variables, see Figure 2.\nRepeat step 3.2 for the right hip and knee.\nInstruct the participant to flex their trunk towards the ground and return to their neutral position.\nWait for a minimum period of 5 s.\nRepeat steps 3.1−3.5 once.\n4. Execute the 30-m linear sprint test\nInstruct the subject to perform a warming up (e.g., the soccer specific FIFA 11+ warming up programme20).",
    "Inform the subject about the test protocol.\n\t\nClearly state that the risk of sustaining an injury during the test is not higher than during normal training and that the subject can abort the test at any time, without giving any reason.\nInstruct the subject to stand in the correct starting position, with their preferred foot standing on the starting line and their shoulders behind the starting line on the field.\nInstruct the subject that the test leader will count down from 3 to 0 followed by shouting 'Start'. Instruct that when 'Start' has been called, the test begins.\nInform the subject to sprint as fast as possible until the 30-m end point has been reached. After the 30-m finish point has been reached, the subject has to decelerate as fast as possible to a standstill position.\nAllow the subject to ask questions. If needed, allow the subject to perform a practice run to familiarize the subject with the protocol.\nAsk the subject if the instructions were clear.\nMake sure the subject is in the correct starting position.\nCount down from '3' to '0' and shout 'Start' to start the test. Start the timer when the start sign has been given.\nEncourage the subject in order to achieve maximal performance.\nStop the timer when the participant has reached their standstill position.\nRepeat steps 4.4−4.6 until three sprints have been performed.\n\tNOTE: Let participants rest for at least 2 min between trials. Include the fastest sprint for data analysis.\nInstruct the subject to perform a cooling down.\nDetach the IMUs from the subject by removing the stretch tape and double-sided adhesive tape from the subject's body.\n5. Data processing\nConnect the IMU with a computer by using a USB cable. Export the raw IMU data to a specific folder on the computer.",
    "Open MATLAB (version r2018b). Import the raw IMU data files (i.e., accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer data).\nSynchronize the raw IMU data files.\n\t\nImport the acceleration data file of one sensor (e.g., pelvis sensor).\nCalculate jerk by differentiating the X, Y and Z acceleration signals. Sum up the X, Y, and Z jerk to obtain the total jerk.\nObtain the mechanical peak by finding the index value in the data file where the total jerk has reached its maximal value. The index value is the start of the measurement.\nDelete all data points of the acceleration data, magnetometer data and gyroscope data before the index value of the sensor.\nRepeat steps 5.3.1−5.3.3 for each raw data file of the corresponding sensor.\nDetermine which sensor contains the lowest amount of data points by obtaining the number of sampled data points for each data file.\nCut all other data files equal to the size of the sensor that registered signals for the shortest time period.\nFilter gyroscope data using a second order low-pass Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 12 Hz.\n\tNOTE: The filter and particular cutoff frequency were chosen based on visual data inspection in previous pilot experiments.\nObtain sensor orientation with respect to the global earth frame by calculating the orientation quaternion of the sensor using a Madgwick filter35.\n\tNOTE: An extensive description of how sensor orientation with respect to the global earth frame is calculated is described in Madgwick et al.35.\nAlign the sensor coordinate frame to body segment.\n\t\nSelect the index numbers of the data file when the subject was standing still during calibration (step 3.1).\n\t\tNOTE: It is assumed that the longitudinal axis of the sensor is similar to the gravity vector.",
    "Use the index numbers of step 5.6.1 to calculate the average orientation of each sensor with respect to the global reference frame during the static calibration. Then rotate the sensor frame of each sensor, so that it aligns with the global reference frame during static calibration.\nSelect the index numbers of the data file when the calibration movement of the left leg was performed (step 3.2).\nRotate the orientation of the left leg sensors in such a way that the calibration movement is a rotation about the frontal axis only.\nRepeat steps 5.6.3 and 5.6.4 for the calibration movements of the right leg and trunk.\nObtain joint orientations by expressing the orientation of the distal body segment in the coordinate frame of the proximal segment for each joint.\nObtain joint angles by decomposing the obtained joint orientations into 'XZY' Euler angles.\n\tNOTE: How to decompose the obtained joint orientations into 'XZY' Euler angles is described in the work of Diebel36.\nObtain joint angular velocities expressing the gyroscope signals of each distal segment in the coordinate frame of its corresponding proximal segment minus the angular velocity of the proximal segment.\nIdentify each step during the linear sprint by using a step detection algorithm.\n\t\nImport the filtered gyroscope data in MATLAB.\nUse a peak detection function to identify peaks in the gyroscope signal.\n\t\tNOTE: Peak height was set at 286.5 °·s-1 and minimal peak distance was set at 100 samples (= 0.2 s).\nFor each step, calculate the maximum value for hip angle, knee angle, hip angular velocity, and knee angular velocity.\nFor each step, calculate the minimum value for hip angle, knee angle, hip angular velocity, and knee angular velocity.\nFor each step, calculate the hip range of motion by subtracting the minimum hip angle from the maximum hip angle.",
    "For each step, calculate the knee range of motion by subtracting the minimum knee angle from the maximum knee angle.\nSave the processed data to a specific folder on the computer in order to use it for further analysis.\n6. Data analysis\nImport the processed IMU data in MATLAB.\nDivide the sprint into an acceleration, a top speed and deceleration phase based on the steps identified by the step detection algorithm.\n\tNOTE: Sprint phases in this article were chosen arbitrarily. The acceleration phase is defined as step 3 to 837, whereas the deceleration phase is defined as the last eight steps of the sprint. Top speed data was derived from steps performed between these phases.\nSelect the angular velocity data for data analysis.\nCalculate the mean values and standard deviation of the kinematic variables of all steps during each phase of the 30-m linear sprint test.\nRepeat step 6.3 and 6.4 for the angle data."
