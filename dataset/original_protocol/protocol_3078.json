    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSeparate and activate primary naïve T cells\nTiming: 3 days\nObtain pure activated mature T cells for genome editing.\nObtain human blood samples from volunteers or blood bank.\nSeparate human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from the blood sample.\nPre-warm density gradient medium (Ficoll) to room temperature around 25°C before use.\nTransfer blood sample to a 50 mL Falcon tube and dilute 1:2 with PBS.\nAdd Ficoll to another Falcon tube.\nRefer to the table below for the blood sample, PBS, Ficoll volume and tube size.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2822_5.csv\nPipette the diluted blood sample down along the side of the tube gently. The blood sample will stay above the density gradient medium.\nSpin at 1,200 × g for 20 min, accelerate 7, brake off, at room temperature around 25°C.\nCollect the mononucleated cells at the interface between the gradient medium and upper supernatant.\nWash enriched cells by topping up with PBS. Spin at 300 × g for 10 min, normal speed, 4°C.\nWash the pellet again as in h.\nCount the cell number. The PBMCs are now ready for downstream processing. Store the rest of the cells in Freezing medium (90% FBS + 10% DMSO) for future use.\nCritical: The Ficoll has to be pre-warmed to reach room temperature around 25°C. Chilled Ficoll will lose the appropriate density and PBMCs won’t become separated.\nApply negative selection kits, e.g., Pan T cell isolation kit from Miltenyi Biotec (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/SG-en/products/pan-t-cell-isolation-kithuman.html#130-096-535[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/SG-en/products/pan-t-cell-isolation-kithuman.html#130-096-535]) or EasySep™ Human T Cell Enrichment Kit from STEMCELL (https://www.stemcell.com/products/easysep-human-t-cell-isolation-kit.html[href=https://www.stemcell.com/products/easysep-human-t-cell-isolation-kit.html]). Count T cell number, and they are ready for activation. Store the rest of the cells in Freezing medium for future use.\nNote: Negative selection is preferred so that the T cells will not be labeled or pre-activated before adding anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads.",
    "Prepare anti-CD3/CD28 Dynabeads or suitable alternative for T cell activation.\nEvery 25 μL of bead solution can be used for activation of 1 × 106 T cells: use a T cell:bead ratio of 1:1.\nDraw amount of beads solution according to the cell number for activation and add equal volume of buffer (PBS with 0.1% BSA, 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.5), or at least 1 mL, and mix (vortex for 5 s, or keep on a roller for at least 5 min).\nPlace the tube on a magnet for 1 min and discard the supernatant.\nRemove the tube from the magnet and resuspend the washed beads with equal volume of culture medium as the initial beads volume.\nBeads are ready to be used.\nMix washed beads and T cells evenly at a concentration of 1 × 106 T cells/mL. Supplement with human IL-2 at 100 U/mL.\nActivate the T cells with beads in 37°C incubator for 60 h.\nGenome editing and HDR gene insertion\nTiming: 2 h\nInsert gene selection markers into target gene locus.\nAdd 1 mL of T cell culture medium into one well of a 12 well plate and incubate at 37°C to pre-warm the medium.\nPerform PCR on the HDR donor DNA fragment, containing LHA-selection gene marker-RHA, from HDR template plasmid template. The PCR reagents and running programs are shown in “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nPrepare RNP solutions for electroporation.\nMix crRNA and tracrRNA and run duplex cooling program according to “materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]”.\nAdd Cas9 protein to the duplexed gRNA and incubate at 37°C for 20 min.\nCentrifuge the 1 × 106 T cells at 90 × g for 10 min at room temperature around 25°C. Remove supernatant completely.\nResuspend the T cell pellet carefully in 100 μL of Nucleofector® Solution.",
    "Mix RNP solutions with the 2 μg donor DNA fragment for at least 30 s. Combine 100 μL of cell suspension with RNP-DNA mixture, transfer the suspension into a cuvette.\nNote: The sequence of adding RNP, DNA, and cell solution will affect the editing efficiency. The RNP and DNA is suggested to be mixed before the cell solution is added.\nSelect the appropriate Nucleofector® Program EH-115 in the 4D Lonza electroporator.\nAdd 500 μL of the pre-equilibrated culture medium from the prepared 12 well plate to the cuvette and gently add the cell sample back to the well dropwise.\nCritical: Avoid any harsh operations, such as repeated aspiration, be as gentle as possible. Harsh operations will induce cell death.\nPut into the 37°C incubator for 15 min.\nAdd IL-2 (500 U/mL) to each well and culture until confluent in the 12-well plate.\nOptional: HDR enhancer can be added to further enhance the insertion efficiency.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]\nThe HDR gene insertion efficiency can be observed after 48 h.\nClone isolation and gene expression validation\nTiming: 1 week\nGenerate GOI double allele knockout T cell clones.\nCheck the selection gene marker expression, for example expression of CAR-His and CARMyc.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3], Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2822-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Clone isolation and gene expression validation\n(A) Expression of gene markers after HDR insertion. CAR-Myc and CAR-His are used to indicate GOI disruption at different allele. LCK gene is used as a demonstration.\n(B) Sorting and restimulation of selected clones. Double positive gene marker expressed T cells (DP) and single positive gene marker expressed T cells (CAR-His or CAR-myc) are sorted and restimulated individually.\n(C) PCR results of editing DNA region. The single positive gene marker expressed T cells are used for illustration, and both inserted CAR gene and WT DNA fragment can be detected.",
    "(D) Western blot of LCK expression in DP and SP T cells. The data are retrieved and reorganized from the study by Wu et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nSort the double selection gene marker-expressing cells by staining with fluorescent antibodies and a fluorescence flow cytometer. Culture the sorted cells and supplement with IL-2 (500 U/mL in medium).\nWhen the sorted T cells stop or slow down their proliferation, restimulate and expand the sorted cells using irradiated PBMCs as feeder cells.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] HLA type matching is not required.\nIrradiate PBMCs in 30Gy. The number of PBMCs should be slightly higher than the designated number, for irradiation will induce some cell death.\nAlternatives: Mitomycin C (MMC) can be used to arrest the PBMCs proliferation. In this case, incubate PBMCs with 20 μg/mL of MMC for 1 h in a 37°C incubator. Wash the cells with PBS three times after incubation. The PBMCs are ready to use.\nMix irradiated PBMCs with sorted T cells at cell number ratio of 3:1.\nNote: If the sorted cell number is few (fewer than 1 × 106 cells), add PBMCs according to the surface area. Add 3 × 106 and 1 × 106 irradiated PBMCs to one well of 6 well plate and 12 well plate respectively. If doing more strict clone selection by FACS sorting, fewer than 20 cells per well of a 96 well plate, add 2 × 105 of irradiated PBMCs per well of a 96 well plate.\nSupplement the medium with 100 U/mL IL-2, 10 ng/mL IL-7, and 10 ng/mL IL-15 and 1.5 μg/mL PHA lectin. This day is designated day 0.\nAt day 5, T cell clusters are visible, and T cell clones are expanding. Passage the expanded T cells accordingly and maintain cell density at 1–3 × 106/mL.",
    "Check the expression of selection gene markers. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nNote: It is important to select cells expressing both markers, as single marker-expressing cells could represent only a single allele insertion, where the expression of the protein of interest may not be completely depleted, as shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nThe GOI knockout can be validated by using primers, described at step 7 in “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” session, to PCR the editing region, and by performing western blotting to examine the GOI depletion. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nNote: The PCR results should show only the band of selection gene markers. This validates the GOI knockout. The western blot should also show no GOI expression.\nThe validated GOI knockout clones are then ready for downstream experiments.\nCulture and expand the cells until they arrest the proliferation. Freeze and aliquot the cells in freezing medium (90% FBS, 10% DMSO). The frozen cells are GOI knockout clones.\nNote: The frozen cells can be revived and expanded via the same procedure described as step 20. The clones are able to be restimulated and expanded at least 5 times with similar activity in each cycle."
