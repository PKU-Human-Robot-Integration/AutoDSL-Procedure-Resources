The task should be performed in batches if more sequences are being aligned and results should be combined after sequence stratification. Parameters (Figure 1B):UPPERCASE/lowercase, select \"same as input'.Direction of nucleotide sequences, select “Adjust direction according to the first sequence”.Output order, select \"aligned\".Advanced Settings (Figure 1C):Keep alignment length, select \"Yes\".Strategy, select \"auto\".Download the aligned sequence in FASTA format, once available.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3871/bioprotoc-10-24-3871-g001.jpgFigure 1. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) using MAFFT online service Video for Procedure A-B: https://youtu.be/hbnsXnikRak[href=https://youtu.be/hbnsXnikRak] Alternatively, download a ready-to-use MSA file from our OSF page (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/NPCS6[href=https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/NPCS6]). Note: Data in our original publication (Khan and Cheung, 2020) was downloaded from GISAID that does not permit the release of MSA files publicly. The MSA file provided on our OSF page was generated using sequences downloaded from the NCBI virus. The file would be updated periodically during the pandemic (file 1 aligning 19863 SARS-CoV-2 sequences).",
    "Save Region of Interest (ROI) for each primer/probe as a separate FASTA fileOpen the MSA file from Procedure B or Procedure C in the AliView program.Note: Aliview program (available from https://ormbunkar.se/aliview/[href=https://ormbunkar.se/aliview/]) needs to be downloaded on the computer in advance. Find the primer binding site using the “find” function (Figure 2A) or using “add and align sequences from clipboard” function (Figure 2B).Reverse-complement the primer/probe sequence as necessary using Sequence Manipulation Suite (https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/rev_comp.html[href=https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/rev_comp.html]).>CN-CDC-N_FGGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAATimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3871/bioprotoc-10-24-3871-g002.jpgFigure 2. Finding the Region of Interest (ROI) in MSA Select the ROI and copy selection as FASTA format (Figure 3A).Open a new file, \"Paste (fasta-sequences)\" and \"Save\" (Figure 3B). The sequence can be pasted in a text editor and saved as a FASTA file.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3871/bioprotoc-10-24-3871-g003.jpgFigure 3. Saving Region of Interest (ROI) for each primer/probe as a separate FASTA file Video for Procedure D: https://youtu.be/H9UxkgAsMdE[href=https://youtu.be/H9UxkgAsMdE] Sequence stratification: Option 1 – SequenceTracerUpload the individual FASTA file to SequenceTracer and hit \"Submit\" (Figure 4A) (http://www1.szu.cz:8080/EntropyCalcWeb/sequences[href=http://www1.szu.cz:8080/EntropyCalcWeb/sequences]). The SequenceTracer segregates data into discrete groups of identical sequence variants and presents a detailed view of the nucleotide variation in each ROI along with the frequency of each variant. Moreover, the sequences showing ambiguous sequences are grouped as “outgroup1”, short sequences are grouped as “outgroup2” and missing sequences are grouped as “excluded”.Download the stratified data showing a list of sequence variants and/or a chart (Figure 4B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3871/bioprotoc-10-24-3871-g004.jpgFigure 4. Sequence stratification using SequenceTracer Video for Steps E1-E2: https://youtu.be/ysT_KBXkpvw[href=https://youtu.be/ysT_KBXkpvw] The \"stratify\" file can be opened using Microsoft Excel while the \"compressed\" file can be opened using the AliView program or a text editor (Figure 5).The data of any sequence variant group can be downloaded (Figure 6).First, select the group.Then, “Add all to Notes”.Finally, \"export\".imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3871/bioprotoc-10-24-3871-g005.jpgFigure 5.

    "v=4S0T9TW5ax4] Sequence stratification: Option 2 – ElimDupesUpload the individual FASTA file to ElimDupes (https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/elimdupesv2/elimdupes.html[href=https://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/sequence/elimdupesv2/elimdupes.html]).Select parameters as shown and hit \"Submit\" (Figure 7A).View or Download \"Unique sequences with rank and count appended (_count)\" (Figure 8B).The file would show sequence variants, along with rank and count added to the sequence name. The file can be opened using the AliView program or a text editor (Figure 7C).Note: As opposed to SequenceTracer, variants with ambiguous sequences, and with missing sequences would be ranked in the results and need to be separated manually. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3871/bioprotoc-10-24-3871-g007.jpgFigure 7. Sequence stratification using ElimDupes Position Nucleotide Numerical Summary (PNNS)As the sequence variation was moderate, the base composition of each nucleotide position was not analyzed in the original publication. This can be performed for highly variable regions using the Position Nucleotide Numerical Summary (PNNS) calculator (http://entropy.szu.cz:8080/EntropyCalcWeb/pnns[href=http://entropy.szu.cz:8080/EntropyCalcWeb/pnns])."
