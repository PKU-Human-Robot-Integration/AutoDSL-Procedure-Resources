    "All animal care and experimental procedures followed the guideline from the National Institutes of Health and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Michigan. Use RNase-free solutions and pipette tips throughout the protocol. Clean the working area, pipettes, tubes, and centrifuge with RNase Decontamination solution following the manufacturer guidelines (see Materials Table).\n1. sgRNA Target Selection\nUsing a web browser, open the webpage: http://crispor.tefor.net8\nInput ~60 base pairs (bp) of sequence flanking the desired edit of interest (i.e. 30 bp 5' and 3' of desired edit).\nSelect the Caenorhabditis elegans genome from the pulldown menu.\nSelect the Protospacer Adjacent Motif (20 bp-NGG - SpCas9, SpCas9-HF1, eSPCas9 1.1) from the pulldown menu.\nClick submit. In the results page, choose the top ranked target sequence closest to the edit of interest. If there are no suitable target sites within the flanking 60 bp input sequence, expand the query sequence up to 100 bp (i.e. 50 bp either side of the desired edit).\nFrom an available source, e.g. synthego, obtain a 20-mer target sgRNA with the following specifications: 3 nmol; no modifications.\nUpon receipt, centrifuge lyophilized sgRNA containing tube at >12,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature. Add 60 µL of nuclease-free TE to the tube, and gently re-suspend by pipetting up and down 15 - 20 times using a P200 pipette. The final concentration is 50 µM.\n2. Homology-directed Repair Template Design\nDesign an ssODN HDR template containing: 1) the mutation of interest, 2) a unique in-frame restriction endonuclease site, 3) a silent mutation of one or both of the Gs within the NGG PAM sequence, and 4) 50 bp 5' and 3' homology arms flanking the first and last mutation. (Figure 1C)9,10.",
    "If mutation of the NGG PAM sequence is not possible, introduce 5 - 6 silent mutations within the sgRNA target recognition sequence to prevent sgRNA-mediated cleavage of the ssODN HDR template.\nFrom an available source, e.g. idtdna, obtain an \"Ultramer DNA oligonucleotide\" with the following parameters: Scale: 4 nmol; Formulation: None; Purification: Standard Desalting.\nUpon receipt, centrifuge lyophilized ssODN containing tube at >12,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature. Gently re-suspend ssODN to a final concentration of 100 µM in nuclease-free ddH2O by pipetting up and down 15 - 20 times using a P200 pipette.\n3. Design Genotyping Primers\nDesign a primer set flanking the genome modification to generate a ~400 - 700 bp PCR amplicon11.\nOptimize PCR cycling conditions to produce a single and specific amplicon11.\n4. Prepare Injection Mix\nCentrifuge Table 1 reagents at maximum speed for 2 min at 4 °C.\nIn the order listed, add Table 1 reagents to a nuclease-free PCR tube.\nMix thoroughly by gently pipetting up and down 10 times with a P20 pipette.\nIncubate injection mix for 10 min at room temperature.\n5. Injection Protocol\nLoad injection micropipette with approximately one-half of the injection mix12. Save remaining injection mix in case the injection needle clogs or breaks.\nBreak micropipette tip so that ~20 - 30 p.s.i. produces a gradual flowing solution12.\n\tNOTE: Larger diameter tips negatively affect animal health and decrease F1 progeny yield.\nInject 10 - 15 young adult worms in both gonadal arms if possible12. If not, injection into one gonadal arm is sufficient.\nAllow injected animals (P0) to recover for 1 - 2 h at room temperature on an OP50-seeded 35 mm nematode growth media (NGM) plate. Subsequently, single injected P0 animals to individual OP50-seeded 35 mm NGM plates using a platinum wire worm pick12.",
    "6. Screen P0 Plates and Single mCherry(+) F1s\nTwo days post-injection, identify P0 plates containing F1 progeny expressing mCherry in the pharynx using a fluorescent stereomicroscope (Figure 1D, day 2 - 3). Choose three P0 plates that contain the most mCherry(+) F1 animals.\nFrom each of the three selected P0 plates, single 8 - 12 mCherry(+) F1 animals for a total of 24-36 mCherry(+) F1s using a worm pick (Figure 1D, day 2 - 3).\n\tNOTE: mCherry(-) animals can also be singled from these P0 plates, but the probability of identifying correctly edited animals is much lower (Figure 2A).\nAllow individual F1s to self-fertilize and lay eggs for 1 - 2 days at room temperature.\n7. Single Worm PCR and Genotyping\nAfter 1 - 2 days of egg-laying, transfer the F1s into individual PCR strip tube caps containing 7 µL of Worm Lysis Buffer using a worm pick (Table 2, Figure 1D, day 4 - 5).\nCentrifuge PCR tubes at maximum speed for 1 min at room temperature to bring animals to the tube bottom, and freeze tubes at -80 °C for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: Worms can be stored at -80 °C indefinitely.\nLyse frozen worms in a thermocycler using the following program: 60 °C for 60 min, 95 °C for 15 min, 4 °C hold.\nSet-up PCR mastermix as shown in Table 3.\nAdd 21 µL of PCR mastermix into clean PCR tubes, and then add 4 µL of worm lysis from step 3. Mix well using a pipette and run PCR program following the manufacturers guidelines (see Materials Table).\nPurify PCR reactions using a DNA Clean and Concentrate kit, following the manufacturer instructions (see Materials Table). Elute DNA by adding 10 µL water to the spin column.\nSet-up restriction enzyme mastermix as shown in Table 4.",
    "Add 10 µL of the restriction enzyme mastermix to each cleaned PCR reaction and incubate for 1 - 2 h at 37 °C13.\nSeparate digested PCR products on a 1.5% agarose gel run at 120 V using 1x Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer14.\n8. Identification and Sequence Verification of Edited Animals\nExamine enzyme digested samples for the presence of bands that indicate potential edited animals14 (Figure 1D, day 4 - 5).\n\tNOTE: Load an N2 control to identify potential indel mutations which can be observed as shifts in band size and/or unexpected and complex restriction enzyme digestion banding patterns.\nAfter identifying potential edited animals, use the remaining 3 µL of worm lysis and repeat the PCR reaction. Do not clean or restriction enzyme digest the PCR reaction after the program is complete. Load the PCR reaction on a 1% agarose gel, separate and extract the band using a gel extraction kit15 (see Materials Table).\nSanger sequence16 gel extracted DNA using the F1 primer to identify correctly edited animals (Figure 1A)\n\tNOTE: Heterozygote reads will contain overlaid peaks due to the presence of the wild type and engineered allele.\nTo obtain homozygous animals from verified heterozygous edited animals, single 8 - 12 F2 animals and perform steps 7 - 8.\nSubscription Required.
