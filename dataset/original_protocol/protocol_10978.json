    "1. Design and fabrication\nDevice design\n\t\nFor microfluidic device fabrication, create an SU-8 mold using a 200 µm layer of SU-8 spin-coated onto a Si-wafer (RCA-1 cleaned and 2% hydrogen fluoride (HF) treated), followed by a single mask photolithography step as described previously8,9.\nCast a 4 mm thick polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) replica from the SU-8 mold to generate a durable polyurethane mold for downstream fabrication steps. Various design iterations can be used8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15.\nIn the current iteration, design the microfluidic device to be custom-fitted into a standard 96-well plate format and consisting of a 2 mm thick PDMS feature layer with 12 microfluidic device units enclosed by a thin (1/16 inch) transparent polymer membrane layer on the bottom (Figure 1A).\nEnsure that individual tissue units consist of a tissue chamber flanked by gel loading inlet (L1) and outlet (L2), a pressure regulator (PR)16, and decoupled microfluidic channels connected to 2 media inlets and outlets on each side (M1-M2, M3-M4; Figure 1B).\nPosition each inlet and outlet within a single well that serves as a medium reservoir to establish hydrostatic pressure (10 mm H2O) across the microfluidic channel. To allow vascular network anastomoses with the outer channels, connect microfluidic channels to the tissue chamber via 50 µm wide communication pores (6 on top, 6 on bottom).\n\t\tNOTE: Microfluidic resistors create a 5 mm H2O interstitial pressure gradient across the tissue chamber that becomes intraluminal once the vascular network is fully formed8,10. The subsequent procedures begin with a fully assembled high throughput plate.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65865/65865fig01v2.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Microfluidic platform design. (A) The schematic of the platform assembly shows the PDMS feature layer with 12 device units bonded to a bottomless 96-well plate and sealed with a thin transparent polymer membrane. Each device unit occupies a column of wells on the plate. The single device unit outlined in red is shown with details in (B). (B) Schematic of one device unit shows a single tissue chamber positioned within one well of the 96-well plate and two loading ports with inlet and outlet (L1-L2) hole punched to allow cell-matrix mix to be introduced. Medium inlets and outlets (M1-M2, M3-M4) are hole-punched and positioned within wells that serve as media reservoirs. Different volumes of media establish a hydrostatic pressure gradient across the tissue chamber via decoupled microfluidic channels. The pressure regulator (PR) unit serves as a gel burst valve to increase ease of loading. Note that the device is 200 µm deep, and the tissue chamber is 2 mm x 6 mm.

Preparations prior to loading\nCell culture\n\t\nMaintain cells according to the manufacturer's recommendations in a humidified 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubator.\nPlate T75 flasks of transduced EC, NHLF, or other fibroblast/stromal cell and desired cancer cells 3-4 days prior to loading at a density informed by manufacturer and user protocols. For this protocol, plate 1 x 106 cells per flask for each cell type. Culture EC in Endothelial Growth Media 2 (EGM2) complete media, NHLF in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS, and cancer cells in appropriate media depending on cell type.",
    "Maintain cells by feeding with the respective media every 2-3 days and reconfirm the transduction or labeling efficiency by visualizing cells under a fluorescent microscope. On the day of loading, ensure EC is 80%-100% confluent, whereas NHLF is subconfluent at 70%-80%.\nPreparation of fibrinogen\n\t\nPrepare the fibrinogen solution to the desired concentration (typically, 5-8 mg/mL supports robust vascular network formation), accounting for the percent clotting of fibrinogen. Calculate the amount of fibrinogen needed with the following equation:\n\t\tFibrinogen (mg) = (volume (mL)) x (concentration (mg/mL))/ (clotting %)\nDissolve the fibrinogen in an appropriate volume of endothelial basal media 2 (EBM2), warmed to 37 °C, by gently flicking the tube (do not vortex). Incubate fibrinogen in a 37 °C water bath to allow it to completely go into solution. Importantly, do not use a complete medium.\nSterile-filter fibrinogen solution with 0.22 µm filter and aliquot to desired volume, typically 400 µL per microcentrifuge tube.\n\t\t​NOTE: Other matrix proteins (e.g., collagens, fibronectin, or laminin) can be spiked into the fibrinogen mix.\n3. Loading of samples\nNOTE: Loading is time-sensitive and should be completed from start (cell lifting) to finish (addition of media to devices) within about 1.5-1.75 h to ensure optimal results. Each step is noted with a suggested timer to help keep the user on track.\nPreparation of materials (Day of loading)\n\t\nPlace the following in a 37 °C water bath for 10-15 min: Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for washing cells, cell dissociation reagent, media (e.g., EGM2, DMEM)\nKeep the following reagents in a 4 °C fridge until ready for use: thrombin, laminin (thawed overnight at 4 °C).",
    "Thaw fibrinogen aliquot at room temperature. Prepare 1.5 µL aliquots of thrombin into 500 µL microcentrifuge tubes, with one tube per device unit. Ensure that the thrombin aliquot is at the bottom of each tube to facilitate loading.\nPlace UV-sterilized high throughput plates into a desiccator for at least 30 min prior to loading to remove air trapped in the microfluidics.\nCell preparation (Timer start = begin at 0 min)\n\t\nCheck cells under the microscope at 4x magnification to confirm confluency and transduction efficiency.\nWash each T75 flask of cells 2x with 5 mL of HBSS and aspirate completely. Add 1 mL of dissociation reagent to each flask and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1-2 min.\nGently tap the plate using the palm of your hand and check that all cells have been lifted.\nWash the cells off the flask with 9 mL of appropriate media and collect them into a 15 mL conical. Immediately remove a small aliquot for cell counting.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 3-5 min at 4 °C. While centrifuging cells, count the cells. A confluent T75 flask of EC or NHLF should yield at least 2 x 106 cells.\nAfter centrifugation, aspirate media and resuspend the pellet in appropriate media at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL. Keep cells on ice.\nPreparation of cell and fibrinogen mixture (Timer = begin at 20 min)\n\t\nDetermine how many devices will be loaded, adding 1-2 to account for pipetting loss, and multiply by the volume of cell/fibrinogen mix needed per device. This will depend on device configuration, but for the device design presented in this article, 6 µL per device is required.",
    "The concentration of each cell type should be determined experimentally. For a starting point, load EC at a concentration of approximately 7 x 106 cells/mL and NHLF at a concentration of 3.5 x 106 cells/mL. The concentration of cancer cells can vary considerably based on their growth rate but typically lies within the range of 0.5-2 x 106 cells/mL. Use this equation to calculate the number of cells needed:\n\t\tNumber of cells needed = (volume of fibrin (µL))/1000 µL x (concentration of cells)\nResuspend the cells at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL and use the following equation to determine the volume of cells needed:\n\t\tVolume of cells needed (µL) = (number of cells needed)/1000\nMix respective volumes of EC, NHLF, and cancer cells (for VMT only) in a conical tube and centrifuge at 300 x g for 3-5 min at 4 °C.\nAfter spinning, carefully aspirate media and pipet away any residual media near the pellet. Gently but thoroughly resuspend the pellet into the calculated volume of fibrinogen, taking extra care not to introduce air bubbles. Keep on ice.\nBring sterilized plates and thrombin aliquots into the tissue culture hood.\nLoading devices (Timer = begin at 30-35 min)\n\t\nUsing a P20 pipette, pipet 6 µL of volume from the cell/fibrin mix. Be sure to pipet the mixture up and down at least 5x to ensure uniform cell suspension. Keep the mix on ice to slow clotting.",
    "Gently mix the cell/fibrin into one tube of thrombin by putting the pipet tip directly into the thrombin aliquot at the bottom of the tube. Immediately pipet up and down at least 2x, taking care not to introduce air bubbles. The fibrin will begin to clot once mixed with thrombin, so quickly but deliberately complete steps 3.4.3. and 3.4.4. before the fibrin gels in the pipette tip (~3 s).\nLift the high throughput plate at an angle and quickly insert the pipet tip into one of the device loading ports (L1 or L2). See Figure 2A for schematic.\nPush the pipet plunger down to the first stop with a smooth, fluid motion to inject the cell/fibrin mix into the tissue chamber. Watch for the gel to cross completely through the chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: Applying too much pressure during this step can lead to bursting of the gel into the microfluidic channels at the top and/or bottom of the tissue chambers.\nGently place the plate back down flat in the tissue culture hood without removing the pipette tip, releasing the pipette plunger, or disturbing the pipette. Use your hand to twist and remove the pipette tip from the P20 and leave it in the loading port hole. Do not use the ejector button to remove the tip as this will cause too much pressure.\nProceed with steps 3.4.1-3.4.5 for the remaining devices.\nWhen loading is complete, allow the plate to sit for 2 min undisturbed in the tissue culture hood.\nRemove pipette tips by gently twisting and pulling them from the loading ports. Replace the lid on the plate.\nIncubate the entire plate for 15-20 min in a 37 °C incubator to allow the gel to fully polymerize.",
    "After incubating, check each device unit under the microscope. Check to see that cells are evenly distributed throughout the chamber without any air bubbles and that there is a clearly visible gel interface between the tissue chamber and the microfluidic channels, as in Figure 2B-C.\nChannel coating with laminin (Timer = begin at 45-50 min)\n\t\nAfter the gels are completely solid, introduce laminin into the microfluidic channels to promote vascular anastomosis.\nUsing a P20, introduce 4 µL of laminin into each microfluidic channel (top and bottom) of the device. Insert the pipet tip into M1 or M3 and expel the laminin slowly, watching to ensure that the laminin coats the entire top channel, and then repeat for M2 or M4 to coat the entire bottom channel.\nDetermine the orientation by pipetting laminin from the side opposite to the pressure regulator to allow sufficient pressure to push it through. However, if laminin does not travel easily from one side, remove the tip from one side and push the laminin from the other side. Going to the second stop of the pipette (i.e., push the plunger all the way down) may be needed to generate sufficient pressure to push the laminin through the entire channel.\nRemove the tip gently from the media inlet/outlet. Do not use the ejector button on the P20.\nRepeat steps 3.5.1-3.5.4 for each device and incubate the plate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 10 min.\nMedia addition (Timer = begin at approximately 1 h 10 min)",
    "Add 275 µL of EGM2 complete media into the uncoupled media reservoirs of wells in rows A and B or G and H. This will be the high side, and the orientation should be determined by making the wells on the side opposite to the pressure regulator high volume to start. Media will be pushed from the high side by gravity.\nUsing a P200 pipette, introduce 75 µL of media into the medium inlets/outlets of the wells containing the 275 µL of EGM2. Insert the tip into the media inlet hole and slowly expel the medium, watching that the media travels through the channel and bubbles up on the other side.\nRemove the pipet tip and push the remaining media from the tip into the media reservoir so that the total volume on the high side is 350 µL.\nRepeat steps 3.6.1-3.6.3 for each device unit, top and bottom channels.\nAdd 50 µL of media to completely cover the low side, wells in rows A and B or G and H, depending on the orientation described above. Ensure that there is an even layer of media covering the bottom of the well. Refer to Figure 2D for a schematic showing volumes of media in the reservoirs.\nRemoving air bubbles (post-loading)\n\tNOTE: Removing bubbles is a critical step to ensure proper flow in each device. By day 2, endothelial cells and fibroblasts will begin to stretch out in response to flow (Figure 2E).\n\t\nOnce all media is added, incubate plates for 1-2 h in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator before checking for air bubbles in the channels or at the medium inlets/outlets.\nVisualize bubbles in the media channels on the microscope and expel by reintroducing 75 µL of media into the channels to push the bubbles out.",
    "Visualize bubbles in the medium inlets/outlets by eye. Use a P200 pipette to remove air bubbles trapped at the medium inlets and outlets by pushing the plunger down, introducing the tip into the hole, and pulling the bubble out by lifting the plunger to apply negative pressure and suck up the bubble.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65865/65865fig02v2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Device maintenance and experimental applications\nMaintenance and drug treatment\n\tNOTE: To maintain flow in the system, hydrostatic pressure must be re-established daily by pipetting the volume of media from the low side back to the high side or vice versa, ensuring the total volume in the high side remains at 350 µL. Flow direction is switched every day after day 2 of VMO or VMT establishment. Additional maintenance and treatment details are provided below.\n\t\nChange media every other day with EGM2 complete until the vasculature is fully established (day 5-6). Aspirate old media completely and replace high-pressure wells (350 µL) and low-pressure wells (50 µL).",
    "NOTE: Experimental determination of optimized media formulations can be conducted for other cell types, often involving a 50:50 mix or addition of specific components into EGM2.\nOnce the vascular network is formed and tissue is fully developed (day 4-7), perform a dextran perfusion test before using the devices for experiments (step 4.2.1.). Only use devices that have sufficient perfusion into the tissue chamber.\nFor experiments using therapeutics, on the day treatment begins, take images in all fluorescent channels for each device. This will serve as a baseline.\nTreat devices with desired therapeutic by replacing the medium with fresh medium containing the diluted drug at the desired concentration. Ensure drugs are diluted in appropriate vehicles depending on manufacturer's recommendation, but do not exceed 0.01% DMSO in the media.\nExpose devices to the drug for the desired amount of time (typically 48 h but can be informed by pharmacokinetics).\nImage every channel of each device at the desired time interval to monitor treatment response. Maintain plates as indicated in step 4.1.1 for the duration of the experiment.\nAt completion of experiment, bleach plates and place in a biohazard container, fix with 4% PFA for immunofluorescent staining (step 4.3.), or harvest for live cell or RNA isolation (step 4.4.).\nPerfusion assays\n\t\nPerfusion of dextran\n\t\tNOTE: Vascular permeability/patency can be determined by perfusing the vascular network with fluorescently labeled dextran of varying molecular weights (40 kD, 70 kD, or 150 kD). FITC- or rhodamine-dextran can be used depending on the fluorescent label of the EC.",
    "Prior to perfusion, determine the appropriate exposure of the FITC or rhodamine channel by adding a few µL of dextran within the fluidic channel or chamber of an empty device. Set exposure time just below the saturation level through the use of microscope software to display a histogram of pixel intensities, ensuring a dynamic range characterized by uniformly distributed pixels without any notable concentration of high-intensity values.\nTake micrographs of all devices in channels of interest, including a background image of all devices in the fluorescent dextran channel, to calibrate against the background. Use the same exposure as determined above and align the tissue chamber at the center of the image frame to ensure consistent images for quantification.\nPrepare a main stock of FITC-dextran or rhodamine-dextran at a concentration of 5 mg/mL in 1x DPBS. This stock can be kept at 4 °C.\nTo prepare a working stock, dilute 5 mg/mL stock to a final concentration of 50 µg/mL in EGM2.\nReplace the media in the reservoirs with the diluted dextran solution as half maximal volume (175 µL into one well as the high side on the top or bottom channel of the tissue chamber). Replace the media in the other wells so that the uncoupled high side gets 175 µL of fresh EGM2 without dextran, and the wells on the low side only have 50 µL in each.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Dextran should only be added to one side of the microfluidic channels (top or bottom) to allow visualization of dye traveling through the high-pressure side, into the vascular bed, and out the low-pressure side.\nUnder the microscope, watch for the fluorescent dextran to flow through the vascular network. This typically will occur within approximately 2 min after adding the dye to the media reservoir.",
    "Begin imaging the fluorescent dextran channel (and other channels, if desired). This is T = 0 timepoint. Take additional images at multiple time points (typically every 10 min) or a single end-point image.\nPerfusion of cells\n\t\tNOTE: Various cell types can be perfused through the vasculature depending on the study design, including lymphocytes or macrophages for cancer immunology studies, as well as cancer cells for metastasis studies. Cells must be fluorescently labeled to facilitate tracking over time.\n\t\t\nAt least 2 h before perfusing cells, perform dextran perfusion on all devices as outlined above. This step is important to determine vascular patency prior to adding cells.\nDetermine the appropriate camera exposure for the cells to be perfused. Take a small sample of cells to view under the microscope and set the exposure time for that fluorescent marker. Set exposure time just below the saturation level.\nTake micrographs of all devices in channels of interest, including a background image of all devices in the fluorescent dextran channel, to calibrate against the background. Use the same exposure as determined in step 4.2.2.1.\nConfirm that dextran has diffused completely out of the tissue chambers before harvesting the cells for perfusion. Harvest and count the cells of interest.\nResuspend cells at appropriate density into EGM2. For example, T cells are typically added at approximately 1 x 106 cells/mL to mimic the concentration in blood.\n\t\t\tNOTE: EC are sensitive to media composition but can tolerate up to 50% mix with most other media. Test beforehand.\nAdd 175 µL of cell suspension into one well on the high side of each device and add 175 µL of EGM2 complete to the other well. On the low side, add 50 µL of EGM2 complete media to both wells.",
    "Under the microscope, watch for the fluorescent cells to flow through the vascular network. This will typically occur within approximately 2 min after adding the cells to the media reservoir.\nOnce cell flow is established, begin imaging the fluorescent cell channel (and other channels, if desired). This is T = 0 timepoint. Take additional images at multiple time points or a single end-point image, depending on the study design. For example, imaging every 10 min will result in high-resolution time courses or every 6-12 h to track periodic cell movements.\nImmunofluorescent (IF) staining\n\t\nAspirate media from wells. Add 200 µL of 4% PFA to both wells of the high side of each device unit and 50 µL to the low side. Allow PFA to flow through the chambers for 15 min at room temperature or 30 min at 4°C.\nDuring the incubation, prepare a 24-well plate with 500 µL of 1x PBS per well. Calculate how many wells are needed to stain each device.\nRemove PFA completely from wells. Turn the plate upside down and carefully remove the plastic backing on the membrane.\n\t\tNOTE: IF staining can also be performed in situ without removing the membrane and device. To do so, perform staining steps by perfusing reagents through the VMO/VMT and increase the duration of each incubation step by approximately 6-fold.\nVery gently and carefully peel the bottom membrane layer off the feature layer of the device to expose the tissue chambers by gripping both corners and pulling down in a slow and smooth motion. Most of the tissue should remain in the tissue chamber. Please refer to Figure 3A.",
    "Use a razor blade or scalpel to apply sufficient force to fully cut through the feature layer and cut a small rectangle around each individual device unit, as shown in Figure 3B.\nWedge a spatula between the feature layer and the well plate. Apply gentle pressure underneath the feature layer to carefully remove the entire feature layer containing the tissue chamber from the well plate.\nPlace each rectangular PDMS feature layer piece containing the tissue face down into a single well containing PBS.\nOnce all units are in wells, wash with PBS by placing the plate on a gentle rocker for 5 min, aspirating PBS from the well, and replacing it with 500 µL of fresh PBS. Repeat for a total of 3 washes.\nAspirate PBS from each well and permeabilize tissues with 500 µL of 0.5% Triton-X in PBS, 2x for 10 min each on a gentle rocker. Remove permeabilization solution.\nBlock in 500 µL of 10% serum in 0.1% Triton-X per device for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking.\nDilute primary antibodies in 3% serum in 0.1% Triton-X to the desired concentration and volume. Remove the blocking solution and add enough primary antibody solution to fully cover the bottom of each well and allow free movement of the device tissues (~200 µL). Cover the plate with a transparent film.\nIncubate the plate rocking overnight at 4 °C. The next day, bring the plate containing device tissues back to room temperature (~15 min).\nAspirate primary antibody solution from each well and wash chambers with 500 µL of PBS, 3x for 5 min each on a gentle rocker.",
    "Add 200 µL of secondary antibody in 3% serum in 0.1% Triton-X at the desired concentration. Incubate the plate with gentle rocking for 1 h at room temperature in the dark.\nAspirate secondary antibody solution and wash with PBS, 3x for 5 min each with gentle rocking. Add a solution of 1x DAPI in 0.1% Triton-X for 10 min while rocking in the dark.\nRemove rectangular device cut-outs containing stained tissues from the plate using tweezers and place tissue-side up on a paper towel.\nPipette a few µL (~10 µL) of antifade solution directly on each chamber and coverslip, taking care not to introduce bubbles. Allow antifade to cure on chambers overnight at room temperature in the dark and then proceed with imaging.\nTissue and cell isolation for molecular assays\n\tNOTE: Each high throughput plate will contain approximately 1-2 x 105 cells, depending on the time point of harvest. Scale the number of experimental replicates to account for total cells as well as potential loss during harvesting.\n\t\nSingle-cell analyses\n\t\t\nAspirate media from each well and invert the high-throughput plate so that the device layer is facing up.\nRemove the plastic backing on the membrane. Very gently and carefully peel the PDMS bottom membrane off the feature layer of the device to expose the tissue chambers by gripping both corners and pulling down in a slow and smooth motion.\nThe membrane can be removed even with proper bonding. Most of the tissue should remain in the tissue chamber after removing the membrane; however, if any portion is stuck to the membrane, follow the steps below on the membrane itself.",
    "Wash each device unit with 500 µL of HBSS or PBS. To each device unit, add 100 µL of dissociation reagent and allow it to sit as a droplet on top of the device. Put the plate back in the 37 °C incubator for 5 min.\nAfter digestion, use a P200 pipette to pipet up and down across the tissue chambers and collect the tissues in the dissociation reagent. Move the pipet tip back and forth across each device to ensure full removal of the tissue and collect into a 15 mL conical with 500 µL of EGM2 to neutralize the dissociation reagent.\nFor full removal of remaining cells from the tissue chamber, add 500 µL of EGM2 to each device unit and wash with a P200 pipette.\nCentrifuge the digestion solution containing the dislodged tissues at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet single cells and whole tissues.\nCarefully aspirate media and add 500 µL of 1 mg/mL (200 U/mL) collagenase type IV, 0.1 mg/mL hyaluronidase type V, and 200 U/mL DNAse type IV in HBSS to the tissues.\nAfter gentle resuspension, allow the solution to sit for 2 min at room temperature before pipetting gently again to dissociate the gel.\nWash digestion mix with 10 mL of EGM2 and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Resuspend cells in 1x DPBS with 1% BSA or HSA and pass through a pre-wetted 70 µm filter by spinning at 200 x g for 1 min.\nCount the cells and adjust the volume so that the final concentration is 1000 cells per µL. Cellular suspensions can then be subjected to FACS, flow cytometry, or single-cell RNA sequencing.\nRNA isolation from whole tissues\n\t\t\nFollow steps 4.4.1.1 and 4.4.1.2 above.",
    "Add approximately 10 µL of RNA lysis buffer onto each exposed tissue chamber, ensuring that buffer pools directly on top of tissues. Do not use more than 100 µL of RNA lysis buffer in total.\nIncubate for 3 min at room temperature. Use the P20 to pipet up and down on each device unit and use the pipet tip to scrape any residual material from the tissue chamber if necessary.\nTransfer as much lysis buffer as possible into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Repeat steps 4.4.2.2.-4.4.2.3. for remaining devices and pool samples into the 1.5 mL tube.\nFollow the manufacturer's instructions for isolating RNA, depending on the kit or reagents.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65865/65865fig03v2.jpg\nFigure 3.
