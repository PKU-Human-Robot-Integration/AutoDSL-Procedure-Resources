    "Patients who underwent ablation of a right or left atrium flutter substrate were included (Table 1). The presence of decompensated or severe systemic disease, thrombus within the left atrium, renal failure, age <18 years, body mass index >40 and pregnancy were the exclusion criteria. This protocol is part of the initial safety and feasibility protocol approved by the Institution Research and Ethics Committee. No atrial fibrillation procedures were included in this protocol. All patients gave informed consent. \n1. Description of the Robotic Magnetic Navigation System\nThe Catheter Guidance Control and Imaging (CGCI) system employs eight powerful electromagnets to produce a highly agile magnetic field (to 0.16 Tesla) within an effective control area optimized to focus and contain the magnetic field almost entirely within the magnetic chamber. The magnetic chamber operates silently, has no moving parts and cools the electromagnet coils with non-toxic mineral oil. Current-regulated amplifiers provide the power to the magnetic chamber coils. The system produces magnetic fields 10 to 20 times less in intensity than Magnetic Resonance Imaging and no magnetic fields are generated when it is not in magnetic guidance mode. The magnetic field generators provide torque and force for moving, positioning and directing the tip of a catheter equipped with three permanent magnet pellets attached to its distal end.",
    "The Robotic system includes an Operation Console, the CGCI Controller computer and a motorized linear catheter advancement mechanism. The system uses a standard 3-axis joystick, which is used to rotate the magnetic field and manually advance or retract the catheter. A 3D Controller is used to push the catheter in any screen-oriented direction. The X-Ray C-Arm may be rotated or extracted at the Operation Console using the X-Ray Dialog. The Operation Console unifies the display of the CGCI system, electroanatomical mapping system, EP recording system, intracardiac ultrasound (ICE), and X-Ray.  It allows the direct keyboard and mouse control over the electroanatomical mapping system and EP recording system. Typically, the center screen is used for the electroanatomical mapping system screen and the CGCI overlay graphics. \n2. Patient's Preparation\n Admit the patient to the hospital the same day or the day before the procedure. Overnight fasting state is required.    \nPosition the patient on the operation table, where the nursing staff cannulates a peripheral intravenous catheter before the procedure.\nOutside of the magnetic chamber, the medical staff obtains right and left vein femoral access under local anesthesia with lidocaine. Place sheath introducers into the right and left femoral veins. We recommend guiding left atrium substrates using intracardiac echocardiography, which probe is introduced through a 9 French (Fr) left femoral vein sheath and positioned into the right atrium. \nFor left atrium substrates, administer an initial intravenous bolus and repeated doses of heparin to maintain an activated clotting time of 250-300 s.\nAdminister an initial bolus of 2 mg of midazolam followed by continuous intravenous propofol sedation and intermittent intravenous bolus of morphine hydrochloride during the procedure. \n3.  Conventional Electrophysiological Study\nPosition standard catheters through the femoral sheath introducers into the right cardiac chambers for conventional diagnostic electrophysiological study. Use fluoroscopy guidance during manually positioning.",
    "Position a decapolar catheter into the coronary sinus and a screw-in catheter in the right atrial septum. \nIntroduce a special steerable sheath with 3 electrodes along its distal end through the right femoral vein (Figure 1A) and place it in the inferior vena cava or the lower right atrium. \nIntroduce a 7 Fr magnetized catheter into the cardiac chambers through the special sheath (Figure 1A, 1B). Next, perform conventional work up of the arrhythmia mechanism. \nIf necessary (e.g. left atrium flutter mechanism), trans-septal access to the left atrium is achieved using a trans-septal sheath and continuous ICE monitoring. For left atrial flutter procedures also place a multipolar catheter into the left atrium through the trans-septal puncture. \n4. Preparing for Remote Navigation. Catheter, Sheath, and Catheter Advancement Mechanism Assembly \nThe motorized linear catheter advancement mechanism consists of a sterilizable wheel drive gearbox and a motor base. It also includes a disposable sheath clip and leg mount (Figure 2A). The device adds or removes catheter slack.\nMount the sheath in the clip and insert the catheter into the sheath, and manually advance it into the right/left atrium. The latter is confirmed by the mapping system and fluoroscopy. For left atrial substrates position the sheath in the right atrium in close proximity to the interatrial septum.\nNext, place catheter's shaft between the rollers of the wheel drive gearbox by pulling back on the thumb lever.\nThe X-Ray C-Arm is moved to its operational position within the magnetic chamber.  Patient's table is now advanced to localize the thorax within the magnetic field. \nThe operator leaves the operation room and takes control from the operation console.",
    "The Magnetic catheter and the special sheath with electrodes are now shown on the center screen. All CGCI and electroanatomical mapping system operational functions are available at the CGCI operation Console.\n5.  Remote Navigation and Mapping    \nPerform catheter contact calibration of the electrical coupling index system. Maximum and minimum contact values are set up on the control panel.\nFull integration with the electroanatomical mapping system and a closed-loop servo system allow remote navigation and 3D geometrical reconstruction of the right/left cardiac chambers, which allows the procedure to continue with minimal X-ray exposure. \nUse a right hand 3D Controller to steer the catheter to specific sites within the right/left atrium by changing the direction of the magnetic field (Figure 2B). A yellow magnetic arrow indicates the direction of the magnetic field. Use a left hand 3-axis joystick to control the amount of catheter slack (Figure 2C). The motorized device placed at the patient's leg allows the addition and retraction of catheter slack (Figure 2A). \nRapid changes in the magnetic field magnitude, direction, and gradient yield push/pull and/or torque (bend) movements in the distal portion of the catheter. Real-time remote navigation is assessed based on field vector adjustments and subsequent response in the tip of the catheter. A magnetic icon displays the coil power values as colors.  Green indicates a strong positive field, and red indicates a strong negative field (Figure 3).    \nThe catheter tip is aligned parallel to the vector direction of the magnetic flux density. The magnetic field gradient generated for force control of the catheter is up to 0.7T/meter, with a maximal perpendicular force exerted of 25 g.",
    "Perform geometrical point acquisitions from the 4 poles of the magnetized catheter while slowly moving the catheter all around the atrial chambers. A 3D EAM reconstruction can be obtained after few minutes (Figure 3A, 3B).\nRemote navigation with the steerable sheath positioned in the right atrium allows reaching the right inferior pulmonary vein by either directly deflecting the catheter upon crossing the interatrial septum or after making a loop in the opposite wall and then pointing the catheter towards the right inferior pulmonary vein. \nGenerate activation, voltage and first post-pacing interval maps to characterize the reentrant circuit (Figure 4A, 4B).  Identify ablation targets and localize them on the 3D geometry. \n6. Ablation. Manual and Automated Catheter Positioning in the Target Sites\nIn Automated Magnetic Guidance mode, the operator can automatically guide the catheter to specific targets by double-clicking on an electroanatomical mapping system label.  This represents an essential feature to create remote and automatic ablation lines.  \nFor each individual target and with the CGCI system operating in the automated mode, drive the catheter to the target points (Figure 4C). In Automated mode, the system displays a targeting dialog. This indicates the intended target, range, time and targeting search status.\nAccuracy to automatically position the catheter on the target is also measured by the distance of the final location of the catheter to the initial manual positioning. The distance is measured in mm and considered significant if larger than 3 mm. Catheter navigation accuracy requires using the field-scaling tool of the electroanatomical mapping system. \nManual intervention of an automatic search is possible by using the joystick or 3D Controller.",
    "To terminate the arrhythmia deliver radiofrequency energy to specific sites labeled as target points, either manually or automatically guided. The arrhythmia terminates and sinus rhythm is restored upon interruption of the reentrant circuit (Figure 4C, 4D). No re-induction by fast atrial pacing confirms the elimination of the arrhythmia. \nThe safety of the CGCI system is evaluated for each one of the experimental steps."
