    "1. AF4 system setup\nAssemble the AF4 cartridge and connect all hardware components of the AF4 system and the UV-vis detector (Table of Materials) following the instructions given in the manufacturer’s manual.\nInstall all necessary software packages for control, data acquisition, processing and evaluation following the instructions given in the manufacturer’s manual.\nEnsure that all necessary signal connections between the AF4 system and the UV-vis detector have been established.\nEnsure that the established AF4-UV-vis connections are tight and without leakages by flushing the setup with ultrapure water (UPW) for 15 min (tip flow rate 1 mL∙min-1, focus flow rate 1 mL∙min-1, and cross flow rate 1.5 mL∙min-1). To do so, open the AF4 control software and enter the flow rates into the respective panels on the right upper side of the landing page. Tighten the respective connectors (fittings), if necessary, and repeat the procedure until no leakages are observable.\n\tNOTE: The internal system pressure during all measurements should be monitored and must be within 4 to 12 bar. In case the pressure is higher or lower, the backpressure tubing needs to be adjusted. Furthermore, the channel pressure trend should be constant over the complete measurement time.\n\tNOTE: If a channel oven is available, set its temperature to 25 °C to ensure comparable measurement conditions throughout all AF4 experiments.\n2. Preparation of solutions and suspensions for AF4-UV-vis system qualification and sample analysis\nCleaning solution\n\t\nAdd 8 g of solid sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and 2 g of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to 1 L of UPW and stir the solution until total dissolution. \nEluent\n\t\nAdd 500 μL of filtered surfactant mixture to 2 L of filtered and degassed UPW to obtain the eluent (0.025% (v/v), pH around 9.4).",
    "NOTE: A detailed description of the compounds of the surfactant mixture is given in Table 1 (also Table of Materials).\nArbitrary AuNP size standard for mass recovery determination\n\t\nVortex an arbitrary AuNP size standard (50 mg∙L-1) for 2 min and dilute it 1:4 with UPW to obtain a final mass concentration of 12.5 mg∙L-1. Vortex for additional 2 min after dilution to homogenize the obtained suspension.\n\t\tCAUTION: Necessary precautionary measures and suitable protective equipment are required when working with chemicals, especially NaOH pellets.\n\t\tNOTE: It is generally recommended to de-gas and filter all necessary solutions (except for the cleaning solution) using a 0.1 µm membrane filter (hydrophilic PVDF or similar) to ensure low particle backgrounds during AF4-UV-vis-experiments. This can be established by either a dedicated vacuum filtration unit or by using syringe filters.\n3. AF4-UV-vis system qualification\nUse the software settings described in step 1.4 to flush the system with the cleaning solution for 30 min (Tip flow rate 1 mL∙min-1, Focus flow rate 1 mL∙min-1, and Cross flow rate 1.5 mL∙min-1).\nChange the respective eluent bottle and flush the system with UPW for 20 min (Tip flow rate 1 mL∙min-1, Focus flow rate 1 mL∙min-1, and Cross flow rate 1.5 mL∙min-1).\nReplace the respective inline pump filters.\nOpen the AF4 cartridge and replace the AF4 membrane. Reassemble the AF4 cartridge and reconnect it with the AF4-UV-vis system.\nFlush the cleaned AF4-UV-vis system with the eluent for at least 30 min in order to equilibrate the membrane and stabilize the system (Tip flow rate 1 mL∙min-1, Focus flow rate 1 mL∙min-1, and Cross flow rate 1.5 mL∙min-1). Check for potential leakages again (see step 1.4).\nQualify the AF4-UV-vis system by determining the mass recovery and variation of retention time using an arbitrary AuNP size standard.",
    "Perform a direct injection run without application of a separation force.\n\t\t\nCreate a new measurement file by opening File | New | Run in the AF4 control software.\nDefine the sample and measurement description as well as injection volume and sample name within the Run tab. The measurement conditions are displayed in Table 2.\nSet the measurement parameters in the second tab FFF method according to Table 2.\nClick on the Run button to start the measurement.\nPerform a fractionation run with application of a separation force (Cross flow).\n\t\t\nDefine the fractionation method as described in the previous section using the fractionation conditions specified in Table 3.\nClick on the Run button to start the measurement.\nPerform the measurement in quadruplicate.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The first run aims at conditioning the system (i.e., the AF4 membrane) and will be excluded from the final evaluation of the system qualification results.\n\t\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to save all generated run files by opening File | Save in the AF4 control software.\nConsider the AF4-UV-vis-system qualified if a mass recovery of >80% and a variation of retention time <2% is obtained for the arbitrary AuNP size standard.\nWhen using an autosampler as the injection system, fill the autosampler’s needle washing reservoir bottle with the same solution that is pumped through the AF4-UV-vis system (e.g., cleaning solution, UPW, or respective eluent) to ensure optimum run conditions. When changing the eluent, it is generally recommended to follow the re-equilibration of the AF4-system by monitoring the UV-vis-detector signal until its baseline remains stable on a constant level.\n4. AF4-UV-vis sample analysis",
    "Prepare all AuNP size standards for external size calibration by vortexing the respective AuNP suspension (20 nm, 40 nm, 80 nm, 100 nm, each 50 mg.L-1) for 2 min and dilute it 1:4 with UPW to obtain a final mass concentration of 12.5 mg∙L-1. Vortex for additional 2 min after dilution to homogenize the obtained suspensions.\nPrepare the unknown AuNP sample for analysis applying the same procedure as for the calibration standards described in step 4.1.\nPerform a direct injection measurement of all AuNP size standards using the AF4 method displayed in Table 2.\n\t\nTo do so, enter the respective values summarized in Table 2 into the manufacturer’s software at the appropriate positions to define the separation and sample parameters and press the Run button to start the experiment.\nFractionate each AuNP size standard individually using the AF4 method displayed in Table 3 to establish the external size calibration function.\n\t\nEnter the respective values summarized in Table 3 into the manufacturer’s software at the appropriate positions. The fractionation method is defined by a focusing step, several elution steps, and a rinse step. After setting up the method, press the Run button to start the experiment.\nPerform a direct injection measurement of the unknown AuNP sample using the AF4 method displayed in Table 2.\nPerform the fractionation of the unknown AuNP sample by conducting the AF4 method listed in Table 3.\nCarry out all measurements mentioned in Section 3 and 4 in triplicate unless stated otherwise to ensure meaningful and statistically relevant results.\n\t\nStore 50 mg∙L-1 AuNP stock suspensions at 4–8 °C before use. Diluted AuNP suspensions are ideally prepared within 30 min prior to application.\n\t\tNOTE: Vortexing is usually sufficient and no ultrasonication of the suspensions is necessary.",
    "In order to enable a correlation of the retention time of the unknown AuNP sample with the retention times obtained for the AuNP size standards, measure all samples using the same AF4 method.\n\t\tNOTE: To assure constant and valid separation conditions, include/repeat the fractionation step described in the system qualification section (see step 3.6.2) after a defined number of sample measurements (e.g., 10 measurements). In addition, record system pressure and UV-vis detector baseline stability. They should remain stable and constant along a complete AF4-UV-vis run.\n\t\tNOTE: Usually, replace the ultrafiltration membrane when the UV-vis detector (or Multi Angle Light Scattering (MALS) detector, if available) shows an increased noise level or the defined system qualification criteria such as recovery, sample peak shape, or repeatability are missed (or the AF4-UV-vis-system was subjected to a thorough cleaning procedure). Under the conditions described here, the qualified AF4-UV-vis system is usually stable for at least 50 measurements using the same membrane; however, the number of possible consecutive measurements meeting the defined quality criteria can vary significantly depending on sample, sample matrix, and eluent composition.\n5. Data evaluation\nPerform the mass recovery calculation using either data evaluation software provided by the AF4-UV-vis system manufacturer or spreadsheet analysis after export of all necessary raw data (i.e., UV-vis peak area) from the respective data acquisition software following the instructions given in the manufacturer’s manual.\n\t\nCalculate the AuNP mass recovery by comparing the areas under the respective UV-vis peaks of the fractionation measurement (Afractionation) and the direct injection measurement (Adirect injection) using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61757/61757equ02.jpg",
    "NOTE: During a direct injection measurement, no separation force is applied, and therefore potential interactions of an analyte species with the accumulation wall can be neglected. The area under a respective UV-vis peak can be directly correlated to the AuNP mass using Beer-Lambert law assuming that no other species within the sample absorbs at the respective wavelength and/or i) elutes at another retention time under fractionation conditions ii) is removed through the AF4 membrane.\nImport the dat. files obtained from both the direct injection and the fractionation run.\nSelect the UV-vis detector trace in the Overview tab.\nDefine a Region of Interest (ROI) and a baseline in the signal and baseline view for all measurements.\nInsert a Direct Injection Calibration via Insert.\nSelect all direct injection runs in the Direct Injection Calibration Settings view and enter a UV extinction coefficient.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to use the same UV-vis extinction coefficient for both the calibration and the fractionation measurement.\nEstablish the calibration line using the area under the UV-vis signal trace within the ROI and the injected amount calculated from the entered concentration and the injection volume. The obtained calibration will be shown in the separate Direct Injection Calibration Function window.\nAssign the calibration function to the respective fractionation measurements.\n\t\tNOTE: For each calibration size standard and the unknown AuNP sample, a separate calibration function needs to be established due to the size dependent UV-vis absorbance of AuNP. This drawback of the UV-vis detector can be circumvented using a mass-sensitive detector such as an ICP-MS.\nPerform the analyses by inserting a Quantitative Results calculation and the results will be displayed within a table on the right as concentration and injected amount values.",
    "Calculate the variation of retention time using either data evaluation software provided by the AF4 system manufacturer or spreadsheet analysis after export of all the necessary raw data (i.e., retention times of the AuNP calibration standards at the respective UV-vis peak maxima and respective void times) from the respective data acquisition software following the instructions given in the manufacturer’s manual.\n\t\nOpen the Overview window to display the respective UV traces for all imported measurements.\nThe peak detection will be performed automatically; adjust the peak detection parameters within the signal processing toolbox to optimize the performance. Extract the respective peak maxima by going through all measurement files.\nCalculate the relative standard deviation for all measurements using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61757/61757equ01.jpg\n\t\tThe calculation can also be performed using a respective spreadsheet software.\nPerform size determination using either data evaluation software provided by the manufacturer or spreadsheet analysis after export of all the necessary raw data (retention time at UV-vis peak maximum of analyte and respective void time) from the respective data acquisition software following the instructions given in the manufacturer’s manual. An external size calibration function can be established by plotting the void time corrected retention times (net retention times, see Table 5) of the AuNP size standards (20 nm, 40 nm, 80 nm, 100 nm) against their hydrodynamic sizes obtained from previously performed DLS measurements (see Table 4).\n\tNOTE: The DLS measurements should be conducted ideally on the same day as the respective fractionation measurements to ensure comparable sample properties.",
    "After importing the .dat files all measurements are displayed in the Overview tab. Select the UV-vis detector signal from the detectors list, which is displayed below the overlay window. Define a ROI and baseline for each measurement, which can be adjusted in the Signal and Baseline view. Use the Signal processing toolbox on the right to smooth noisy signals. Use the Assign Processing Parameters to other Runs function to allow the parameters to be allocated to other measurements, respectively signals.\nSelect the Particle Size Calibration from the Insert tab.\nSelect all calibration runs by clicking on the respective measurement in the Select References for Calibration table on the upper right side. All selected measurements will be displayed in a table below. Enter the hydrodynamic radius for all calibration measurements that are specified in Table 4. The function will be displayed in the Particle size calibration – Function window and the equation will be shown as well.\n\t\tNOTE: The correlation coefficient (R2) of the established size calibration function must be ≥0.990.\nAssign the calibration function to the measurements of the unknown AuNP sample by selecting the respective fractionations within the Select Runs for Assignment list.\nDisplay the results by opening a particle size distribution calculation within the insert tab. The previously created particle size calibration will be listed as the Calibration for the unknown AuNP sample measurements, which is displayed in the right window settings. The calculated size will be shown in the size distribution window labeled to the peak maximum. Select the Average Signals for Sample checkbox to average all measurements of one sample and list the result in the peak maximum label.",
    "Additionally, plot the calibration line over the fractogram by selecting the Show calibration curve checkbox. A cumulative size distribution is available by selecting the Show cumulative distribution checkbox.\n\t\tNOTE: When using manufacturer’s software for data evaluation, it is recommended to add all results to a report, which can be generated by clicking on Report inside the Insert tab. The Report button adds all results, tables, and diagrams to a document. Under the Report tab, the report settings can be changed by opening Report setup within the Document section."
