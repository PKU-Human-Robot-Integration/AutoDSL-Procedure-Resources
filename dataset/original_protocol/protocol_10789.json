    "1. Isolating Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (ASC)\nNote: All procedures were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.\nIsolate rat perirenal and epididymal adipose and wash with sterile Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS) containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) as previously described6.\nMince the tissue and transfer 1-2 g into 25 mL of HBSS containing 1% FBS into a 50 mL tube and centrifuge at 500 g for 8 min at room temperature.\nCollect the free-floating adipose tissue layer and transfer to 125 mL erlenmeyer flask and treat with 25 mL of collagenase type II (200 U/mL) in HBSS for 45 min at 37 °C on an orbital shaker (125 rpm).\nCarefully remove the liquid fraction (below oil and adipose layer) and filter sequentially through a 100-μm and 70-μm nylon mesh filter. Centrifuge the filtrate at 500 g for 10 min at room temperature, aspirate the supernatant and wash the pellet twice with 25 mL HBSS.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 50 mL of growth medium (MesenPRO RS Basal Medium) supplemented with MesenPRO RS Growth Supplement, antibiotic-antimycotic (100 U/mL of penicillin G, 100 μg/mL streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/mL Amphotericin B), and 2 mM L-glutamine and pipet cells into 2 T75 flasks (25 mL/flask).\nCulture the ASC in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C (Passage 2-4 ASC are used for all experiments).\n2. Preparing Chitosan Microspheres (CSM)\nNote: All procedures were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.",
    "CSM are prepared by a water-in-oil emulsification process along with an ionic coacervation technique using our previous protocol6. Emulsify an aqueous solution of chitosan (6 mL of 3%w/v chitosan in 0.5 M acetic acid) in a 100 mL of an oil phase mixture consisting of soya oil, n-octanol (1:2 v/v) and 5% sorbitan-mono-oleate (span 80) emulsifier, using overhead (1700 rpm) and magnetic stirring (1000 rpm) simultaneously, in opposite directions. This dual method of mixing ensures that micelles formed early on before cross-linking occurs can remain in solution and not settle to the bottom. Furthermore, the magnetic stir bar aids in de-aggregating chitosan during micelle formation and rigidization.\nThe mixture is continuously stirred for approximately 1 hour until a stable water-in-oil emulsion is obtained. Ionic crosslinking is initiated with the addition of 1.5 mL of 1% w/v potassium hydroxide in n-octanol every 15 min for 4 h (24 mL total).\nAfter completion of the crosslinking reaction, slowly decant the oil phase of the mixture containing CSM and immediately add the spheres to 100 mL of acetone. Wash the spheres with acetone until the oil phase is completely removed.\nDry the recovered spheres in a vacuum desiccator and analyze without further processing. The average CSM particle size, surface area per milligram and the unit cubic volume was determined using particle size analyzer.\nFor subsequent experiments, wash CSM three times with sterile water to remove residual salts and sterilize with absolute alcohol.\n3. Determining the Number of Free Amino Groups in CSM\nNote: All procedures were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.",
    "Determine the number of free amino groups present in CSM after ionic crosslinking by using the trinitro benzenesulfonic (TNBS) acid assay of Bubins and Ofner7. Incubate 5 mg of microspheres with 1 mL of 0.5% TNBS solution in a 50 mL glass tube for 4 h at 40 °C and hydrolyze with the addition of 3 mL of 6N HCl at 60 °C for 2h.\nCool the samples to room temperature, and extract the free TNBS by adding 5 mL of deionized water and 10 mL of ethyl ether.\nWarm a 5 mL aliquot of the aqueous phase to 40 °C in a water bath for 15 min to evaporate any residual ether, cool to room temperature, and dilute with 15 mL of water.\nMeasure the absorbance at 345 nm with a spectrophotometer using TNBS solution without chitosan as blank and the chitosan used for CSM preparation to determine the total number of amino groups. Estimate the number of free amino groups of the CSM relative to chitosan.\n4. Loading ASC in CSM\nNote: All procedures were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.\nEquilibrate 5 mg of sterilized CSM from section 2.5 in sterile HBSS overnight and add to an 8-μm pore size membrane culture plate insert (24-well plate).\nAfter the CSM have settled onto the membrane, carefully aspirate the HBSS and add 300 μL of growth medium to the inside of the insert and 700 μL of growth media to the outside of the insert.\nResuspend ASC at the appropriate concentration (1 x 104 to 4 x 104) in 200 μL of growth medium and seed over the CSM inside the culture plate insert. The final volume of medium within the culture insert, after seeding, is 500 μL.",
    "Incubate the ASC seeded on CSM for 24 h in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C.\n5. Determining the Percentage of ASC Loading and Cell Viability in CSM\nNote: All procedures were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.\nAfter incubation, collect the ASC-loaded CSM in a sterile 1.5- ml microcentrifuge tube without disturbing the cells that have migrated into the insert membrane.\nRemove the residual medium and add 250 μL of fresh growth medium to the tube.\nTo each tube add 25 μL MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiozole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] solution (5 mg/mL) and incubate for 4 h in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C.\nAfter incubation, remove the medium, add 250 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide, and vortex the mixture for 2-5 min to solubilize the formazan complex.\nCentrifuge the CSM at 2700 x g for 5 min, and determine the supernatant absorbance measured at 570 nm using 630 nm as reference.\nDetermine the cell number associated with the CSM relative to the absorbance value obtained from known numbers of viable ASC.\n6. Characterizing ASC-CSM-Embedded Collagen Gel\nNote: All procedures were performed at room temperature unless otherwise noted.\nMix ASC-loaded CSM (5 mg containing ≈ 2 x 104 cells) with type 1 collagen (7.5 mg/mL) extracted from rat tail tendon according the method of Bornstein8 and fibrillate after adjusting the pH to 6.8 using 2 N NaOH.\nAdd the fibrillated collagen-ASC-CSM mixture to a 12-well plate and incubate for 30 min at in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C.\nAfter complete fibrillation, incubate the collagen-ASC-CSM gels for up to 14 days in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C.\nRelease and migration of cells from CSM into the gel were observed using standard microscopy techniques.\n7. Representative Results",
    "In the present study, we have developed an in vitro strategy to deliver stem cells from chitosan microspheres (CSM) into a collagen gel scaffold. Porous CSM of uniform size (175-225 μm in diameter) and composition were prepared and used as cell carriers (Figure 2). Upon incubating ASC with the CSM, the cells attached at a concentration of 2 x 104 cells/5mg of CSM. The cells were capable of spreading over the microsphere, while extending filopodia into the porous crevices of the microsphere (Figure 3). Once the cell-loaded CSM were mixed with the collagen gel, the cells immediately began migrating into the gels (Figure 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3624/3624table1.jpg\nTable 1.
