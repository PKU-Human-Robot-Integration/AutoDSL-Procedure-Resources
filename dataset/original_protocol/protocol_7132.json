    "Transformation of S. cerevisiae ura3Δ strain with pRS416-TEF1-roGFP2-PRX1 and pRS416M1-TEF1 Isolate the plasmid DNA of pRS416-TEF1-roGFP2-PRX1 and pRS416M1-TEF1 (if necessary).Inoculate 2 mL of liquid YPD in a cultivation tube with the S. cerevisiae ura3Δ strain and shake (200 rpm at 30°C) overnight.Inoculate 20 mL of fresh YPD in a 50 mL Falcon tube with 1 mL of the overnight culture and shake at 220 rpm at 30°C.After 5-6 h of incubation, spin down the S. cerevisiae cells (3 min at 3,500 × g).Remove the YPD in a sterile environment (e.g., in a laminar flow hood), wash the cells with sterile water, vortex, and spin down (3 min at 3,500 × g).Remove the sterile water in a sterile environment, wash the cells with 0.1 M LiAc, vortex, and spin down (3 min at 3,500 × g).Remove the 0.1 M LiAc in a sterile environment, add 200 μL of fresh 0.1 M LiAc, vortex, and keep the suspended cells like this.Take three autoclaved Eppendorf tubes per strain, add 5 μL of the boiled ss-carrier DNA and the two plasmids (100-500 ng) to separate tubes, leaving one negative control (no DNA addition). Also add 25 μL of the yeast 0.1 M LiAc mixture, and finally 200 μL of 50 % PEG 0.1 M LiAc. Vortex the tubes and incubate in 30°C room from 35 min to 3 h, while shaking. The rest of the cells can be discarded.Turn on the water bath to 42°C and incubate the tubes 20-30 min.Spin down 20-30 s at 8,000 rpm and remove the supernatant.Add 100-200 μL of sterile water and resuspend the pellet.Plate the suspensions on marked SD-URA agar plates.Incubate the plates for 72 h at 30°C.Micro-cultivation in the BioLector Before starting this experiment, determine a layout for the 48-well plate.",
    "Leave one or two wells containing only medium, which can serve as the ‘blank’ for the BioLector and as controls for sterile handling. We included three biological replicates, each including two technical replicates for the strain with the pRS416-TEF1-roGFP2-PRX1 plasmid, and two biological replicates with two technical replicates each of the strain carrying the pRS416M1-TEF1 control plasmid. If strains are to be compared regarding their intracellular H2O2, they should be examined in the same experiment since the exact profiles differ slightly between experiments. The BioLector plates are delivered sterile and are for single-time use, but they can be reused once or twice after cleaning by the following procedure. Collect the waste directly after the previous run and wash the plate twice with 70% ethanol. Rinse it multiple times with demineralized water to remove the ethanol. Let the plate air dry and store with a plastic layer on the bottom for protection. Before the next run, sterilize with UV light for at least 30 min.Restreak three (or more) colonies per strain on selective solid SD-URA medium.Inoculate three colonies isolated from the SD-URA selective plates per strain in separate cultivation tubes containing 1 mL of SD2xSCAA.Incubate the cultures in an angle of approximately 45° and shake overnight (220 rpm at 30°C).After overnight incubation, determine the OD600 for the precultures with the spectrophotometer.Prepare 3 mL of SD2xSCAA media fresh in culture tubes and add the preculture until an OD600 of 0.01 or 0.005 (no washing step).From these 3 mL tubes, two technical duplicates of 1 mL are added to wells in the 48-well flower-plate.After all the wells are filled, cover the plate with the sealing foil for reduced evaporation and ensure the dots are in the middle of the wells.Load the plate into the BioLector. Before, remove the protective layer at the bottom!",
    "Make sure to refill the (demineralized) water up to above the 150 mL mark in the BioLector for humidity control.Settings for the BioLector. Temperature control on and set to 30°C.Humidity control on and set to 85%.Shaking on and set to 1200 rpm.Filters and measurements: Three different filters were used to measure 1) biomass concentration (absorbance at 620 nm), 2) GFP fluorescence (excitation 488 nm), and 3) UV-GFP fluorescence (excitation 405 nm). The BioLector allows for six channels to be measured at the same time. Since this experiment only required three different filters, one can choose to measure two gains per filter. For the OD620, we selected gains 20 and 30, for GFP, gains 50 and 100, and for UV-GFP, gains 50 and 100. The cycle time of the BioLector to measure the six channels chosen is 20 min. An overview of the filters and gains used is shown in Table 1.Table 1. Filters and gain settings used in the BioLector. Excitation and emission wavelengths for the three BioLector filters and information on the corresponding gain settings used for each of them.table:",
