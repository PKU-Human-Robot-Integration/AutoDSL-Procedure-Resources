    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAssembly of the assay mixture for Mpro activity measurement\nTiming: 10 min\nDepending on the extent of your experiment and the number of samples to measure, plan the number of wells of the multiwell plate you will need and the volume of reagents required, i.e., considering a single reaction volume of 200 μL but also a possible 10% disposable volume. To measure Mpro activity in three replicate measurements, we have routinely used a working solution containing the substrate at a concentration of 100 μM. This working solution is prepared as follows:\nPrepare the 1.025× substrate working solution by adding 20.5 μL of substrate stock solution to 979.5 μL of assay buffer with DTT.\nAfter adding the assay buffer and the substrate but before the addition of the enzyme, pre-warm the plate for 5 min at the desired assay temperature in the plate reader, e.g., 22°C or 37°C.\nBefore measurement, let all solutions equilibrate to room temperature (20°C–22°C).\nDispense 195 μL of the 1.025× working solution in each of 5 wells of a black multiwell plate.\nAfter adding the assay buffer and the substrate but before the addition of the enzyme, pre-warm the plate for 5 min at the desired assay temperature in the plate reader, e.g., 22°C or 37°C.\nMeasurement of the enzymatic activity of the Mpro protease\nTiming: 10–60 min",
    "Enzymatic activity is defined as enzyme units and one enzyme unit corresponds to the amount of enzyme that will release one micromole of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) in one minute in assays with 0.1 mM Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-AMC at 37°C and pH 7.3. In this case, the enzymatic activity can be expressed as increase of fluorescence (arbitrary units, RFU) over time. Most microplate readers allow the analysis of the curves produced by the measurements and a slope value expressed in variation of fluorescent signal per minute can be obtained. These values can be used to compare results obtained within the same measurement or by the same instrument, i.e., in RFU/min.\nFor routine activity assays and inhibition studies, the comparison of fluorescence values as RFU is sufficient. In this respect, a positive control reaction is set up and can be used as a reference of 100% relative to the other reactions.\nIn the procedure, the enzyme mixture is added last to initiate the reaction, the measurement should start immediately (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) with settings enabling fluorescence measurement from the top with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 455 nm every 30 s for at least 10 min.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/987-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Required Equipment\nImage of the SpectraMax M5 plate reader (left) and photos taken during the activity measurement (right), i.e., multi-channel pipette, black multiwell plate, vial with protease stock solution, polypropylene tube for preparation of working solution and assay buffer (in the reservoir). The use of pipette tips with filter is facultative.\nUpon preparation of the working solution, the fluorogenic reaction is started by the addition of the protease.\nTo each well containing the substrate working solution as previously described:\nAdd 5 μL of sample containing active 25 μg/mL MPro for a final concentration of 0.025 μg/mL.",
    "Mix by pipetting up and down several times avoiding bubble formation.\nProceed to measure the fluorescence immediately.\nPlace the microplate in the plate reader and measure the fluorescence from the top with an excitation wavelength of 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 455 nm every 30 s over a 10–60 min period until sufficient data points for a reliable data fitting are gathered.\nShaking during measurement is an option some equipment offer and is beneficial to ensure a more homogenous distribution of both substrate and enzyme.\nExport the data obtained as fluorescence intensity (RFU or AU) vs. time (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nCalculation of the enzymatic activity by data analysis\nTiming: 20 min\nAfter collecting the data on the development of fluorescence (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]) upon addition of Mpro to the substrate working solution, analysis of the curves allows for the calculation of the enzymatic activity in relative or absolute values. The spectrophotometer proprietary software might allow a first-degree polynomial fitting (straight line) of the curves obtained and the direct export of the slope values. Otherwise, this can be performed in Microsoft Excel as follows:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/987-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Example of scatter plot, identification of the linear part of the curve to obtain the slope value corresponding ot the enzymatic activity value as variation of fluorescence over time\nPlot fluorescence intensity values versus time using a scatter plot.\nSet the time scale to minutes.\nSelect at least 5 adjacent points covering more than 1 min in the initial part of the curve for the fitting and plot them separately.\nAdd a linear trendline (straight line) to the data and choose the option to display curve equation and R-squared value on chart.\nInclude as many adjacent points as possible and aim for an R-squared above 0.98 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3], Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/987-Fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4. Development of the fluorescent signal over time upon incubation of 0.1 mM fluorogeneic substrate Ac-Abu-Tle-Leu-Gln-AMC with Mpro at different concentrations.\nThe protease-free control sample is reported as filled triangles.\nRecord the slope value as the activity value in RFU/min (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nMeasurement of Mpro inhibition\nTiming: 10–60 min\nIn order to save reagent while maintaining a substrate concentration below the reported KM, the inhibitor screening assays are performed at 25 μM fluorogenic substrate concentration and 5 μg/mL Mpro concentration by diluting the stock solution 200×, i.e., 100 μL of respective stock solutions to 1.9 mL of buffer. The assay is performed in a black multiwell plate and in a preheated plate reader at 37°C to simulate human body conditions. When scouting for novel inhibitors, the step here presented with ebselen should be adapted to include a wider inhibitor concentration range between 1 nM and 1 mM and through log10 dilution steps.\nAdd 80 μL of working solution MPro to the previously described setup of diluted inhibitor in wells A1-A12, B1-B12 and C1-C12 using a multichannel pipette.\nAdd 80 μL assay buffer to negative control wells D1 and D2 for protease-free control reactions.\nPre-warm the plate for 5 min at 37°C by placing it in the plate reader.\nAdd 20 μL of the 10× fluorogenic substrate to all wells using a multichannel pipette and mix by pipetting up-and down 3 times. Use new pipette tips for every well.\nMeasure fluorescence immediately from the top with excitation wavelength at 380 nm and emission wavelength of 455 nm for at least 10 min in a kinetic mode.\nHighest concentration of inhibitor ebselen in wells A1, B1, C1 is 20 μM, concentration decreases serially by factor two from wells A/B/C2 to A/B/C11.\nWells A12, B12 and C12 correspond to uninhibited MPro activity.",
    "Data analysis of Mpro inhibition study\nTiming: 45 min\nThe spectrophotometer proprietary software might allow a first degree polynomial fitting (straight line) of the curves obtained and the direct export of the slope values (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). These values are activity values, e.g., 265.78 RFU/min in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. Otherwise, the data can be analyzed in Microsoft Excel as previously presented (section above) to obtain the variation of fluorescence per minute (enzymatic activity value).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/987-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Fluorescence development curves over time in the presence of different ebselen concentrations.\nAfter collecting the data on the development of fluorescence upon addition of Mpro in the presence of both the substrate and the inhibitor, the calculation of the inhibitory activity is carried out in software such as Microsoft Excel.\nBy plotting the fluorescence values (RFU) over time and fitting the curve to a straight line, extract the rate of RFU increase over time (RFU/min) for each well using the trend line fitting in Microsoft Excel (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nShow the trend line equation and R2 fitting value.\nIn all uninhibited and partially inhibited wells, RFU increase should be linear over the whole measurement period. The correlation coefficient for these wells should be above 0.98.\nControl wells (D1, D2) without MPro should show low RFU values which do not increase over time.\nWells at inhibitor concentrations higher than a 10-fold IC50 concentration or higher should show no or only marginal RFU increase.\nCalculate the average activity values and corresponding standard deviations of all wells with similar inhibitor concentration using the respective functions in Microsoft Excel, e.g., average values of results from wells A1-B1-C1.\nDivide the average activity, i.e., slope of the curve in RFU/min, of wells with inhibitor by the calculated average slope of samples without inhibitor.",
    "Calculate the relative activity as percentage (%) by multiplying by 100. The relative inhibition value can be obtained by subtracting this activity from 100, i.e., a calculated 10% relative activity in the presence of the inhibitor corresponds to a 90% relative inhibition.\nCalculate the relative standard deviation by dividing the standard deviation of the slopes of replicate wells by the corresponding standard deviation of the average of the corresponding uninhibited wells and multiplying by 100.\nDraw inhibition curve using a scatter graph in Microsoft Excel, i.e., the x-axis presents the inhibitor concentration in a μM concentration and the y-axis presents the relative inhibition as percentage (%).\nRescale to a logarithmic scale on the x-axis.\nCalculate a rough estimation of the IC50 value by interpolation between data points above and below the 50%; for more precise values fit with a sigmoidal curve (Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nNote: For the determination of IC50 with the highest accuracy, it is recommended to use multiple dilution steps with smaller changes (IC50 ± 10–30%) in a second experiment, i.e. to achieve a higher resolution.\nAbsolute quantification of the amount of substrate transformed\nTiming: 60 min\nWhen the enzymatic activity needs to be expressed in enzyme units, i.e., U/mL or U/mg, a conversion needs to be carried out. The conversion factor is specific for each fluorimeter and can be obtained by preparing a calibration curve of AMC, the fluorophore produced by the enzymatic reaction (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_987_3.csv\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/987-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Inhibition curve of ebselen and Mpro protease obtained by plotting the enzymatic activity in fluorescence variation over time vs. inhibitor concentration. Measurements were carried out in triplicate and the average is reposted with the corresponding standard deviation (error bars).",
    "The stock solution of ±10 mM AMC is first diluted in assay buffer to reach a 100 μM concentration.\nCalculate exact volume (±100 μL) of AMC stock solution to reach a final concentration of 100 μM in 10 mL total volume\nAdd calculated volume of AMC stock solution to a 10 mL measuring flask and fill to exactly 10 mL with assay buffer.\nStore in the dark and use fresh.\nIn a black microplate, prepare a series of solutions with varying 7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC, M.W. 5.18 g/mol) concentration ranging from 1.5 μM) to 25 μM, see Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] as example. Include a negative control well with assay buffer only. Each measurement should be performed at least in triplicates, e.g., three replicate wells per concentration.\nMeasure the fluorescence intensity of the solutions containing different amounts of AMC with the same settings used for the activity assay.\nExport the values in fluorescence units, e.g., RFU or AU.\nPlot them against the corresponding concentration of AMC.\nFit the data points in the linear part of the curve and obtain the equation of the fitting curve (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nThis equation, i.e., the slope coefficient 555.86 RFU/μM in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7], can be used to convert the instrument-specific fluorescence values to the concentration of AMC in the assay, resulting from conversion of substrate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/987-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Example of standard curve of the fluorescent moiety AMC alone in assay buffer and data measured with the SpectraMax M5 plate reader (black multiwell plate, PMT setting “low”, 0.2 mL assay volume)\nThis result is device-dependent.\nCritical: Each measurement should be performed at least in duplicate, e.g. two identical wells per condition and an average value calculated and used for the curve fitting. Aim for an R2 value above 0.98."
