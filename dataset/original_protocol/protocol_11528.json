Establishing Primary OS Cell Cultures and OS Finite Cell Lines (OSA)",
    "NOTE: Primary OS cell cultures were prepared from fresh samples of conventional OS biopsies collected at the \"Unità Ortopedia Oncologica e Ricostruttiva\", AOUC Careggi, Florence. All biopsies, which were obtained by needle aspiration or surgical resection of a small portion of the tumor (Figure 1A, B), were immediately placed in culture medium supplemented with 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (pH 7.4) and transported to the laboratory where they were processed. All described manipulations were conducted under aseptic conditions using a laminar flow hood.\nIsolation of OS cells\nPlace the biopsy in a 100 mm Petri dish with a small volume of GM. With a sterile lancet and Perry tweezers, mince the OS tissue samples by cutting them into pieces as small as possible (0.5 - 1 mm) (Figure 2A, B) .\nCover the tissue fragments with 10 ml CM for the enzymatic digestion (Figure 2B) and incubate for 3 h in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Gently remove the suspension of fragments using a pipette and transfer it to a 15 ml conical tube for immediate centrifugation (400 x g for 5 min) to pellet the fragments.\nNOTE: After centrifugation, if the biopsies are rich in erythrocytes, a red deposit composed of erythrocytes can be seen over the fragments. Therefore, before proceeding to mechanical dispersion, treat the sample with erythrocyte lysis buffer. Discard the supernatant by aspiration and add 5 ml ELB.\nSuspend pellet fragments for 1 min and centrifuge the suspension at 400 x g for 2 min. Remove the supernatant by aspiration. Add 5 ml GM and mechanically disperse the fragments using a 10 ml serological pipette (opening size, 1.5 mm internal Ø) 10 - 20 times.",
    "Centrifuge the suspension at 400 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant by aspiration, suspend the cell pellet with 10 ml GM, and then transfer the resulting cell suspension into a 100 mm Petri dish. Incubate the Petri dish in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator and replace the GM with fresh complete GM every 3 d.\nNOTE: Quite often, OS tissue samples obtained by needle aspiration are very small and contain bone fragments, which are not digested by enzymatic digestion with collagenase. Therefore, after the supernatant has been removed, attempt to separate cells from bone tissue by mashing pellet fragments with a pipette.\nSubculture\n\tNOTE: To establish an OSA, when cells reach approximate confluence, remove them from their culture vessel, dilute, and place in a fresh plate to enable further growth. This subculture procedure is achieved using the enzymatic procedure termed trypsinization.\n\t\nRemove the medium by aspiration. To dissociate the cell monolayer, add 2 - 3 ml trypsin at RT (max 18 - 20 °C), shake gently once, and remove the trypsin immediately by aspiration. Repeat twice. Incubate the cells at 37 °C for 3 - 4 min until they begin to detach.\nNOTE: Good trypsinization can be seen by the experienced user as small holes forming in the slightly opaque monolayer when the dish is held to the light. This dissociation can also be monitored using an inverted microscope; this approach is recommended for beginners.\nStop the trypsin reaction by adding 10 ml GM and wash the dish well using a pipette to detach all the cells. Transfer 1 ml of the suspension to a new 100 mm Petri dish and add 9 ml GM (1/10 split of cells).",
    "NOTE: The remaining cell suspension can be used for cell expansion (transfer to another 100 mm Petri dish), can be cryopreserved (see Section 2.3), or can be counted and plated in experimental dishes or wells for proliferation assays or other purposes (see below).\nCryopreservation of OS primary cultures and OSA\nNOTE: Freeze one confluent 100 mm Petri dish into 4-5 cryovials. The process of cryopreservation must be performed quickly because DMSO, which protects cell membranes during freezing, is toxic to cells at non-freezing temperatures.\n\t\nDissociate cell cultures from the monolayer by trypsinization (see Section 2.2), pellet cells by centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min, remove the supernatant by aspiration, and then quickly suspend the cell pellet in FM.\nAliquot 1 ml of this suspension per cryogenic vial. Immediately place the filled vials in a freezer box with a jacket of 2-propanol and store immediately at -80 °C O/N. Transfer cryovials to liquid nitrogen the following day for long-term storage.\nDefrost OS cell lines and primary cultures\nDefrost OS cell lines from liquid nitrogen storage, thawing cryovials rapidly by placing them in a laboratory water bath at 37 °C. Transfer the contents of the cryovials into a 15 ml conical tube and add approximately 10 ml of GM (See Section 2.3 to remove DMSO). Remove the supernatant by aspiration and suspend the cell pellet in 10 ml GM. Plate the cell suspension in a 100 mm Petri dish and incubate in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\n3. Sarcosphere Assay to Isolate OS-CSCs\nNOTE: This experiment is performed on OSA. The duration of this experiment is related to the capacity of the cells to form these sphere colonies (sarcospheres), and the range of time is 7, 14, 21, and 28 d.\nEstablishment of sarcosphere assay",
    "Prepare the haemocytometer chamber and all reagents in advance.\nRemove the medium by aspiration and dissociate the cells from the monolayer by trypsinization (see Section 2.2). Mix the cell suspension thoroughly, pipetting to disperse any clumps, and collect 10 µL using a 20 µL pipette tip.\nTransfer the 10 µL cell suspension immediately to the haemocytometer chamber edge, expel the suspension, and allow it to be drawn under the coverslip by capillary action.\nObserve the haemocytometer chamber under phase contrast. Select a 10X objective and focus on the grid lines in the chamber. Count the cells lying in this 1 mm2 area using the subdivisions (also bound by three parallel lines) and single grid lines as an aid for counting.\nMeasure the concentration and apply the following equation: 1 ml = n*104/z (n: the whole number of cells in all the counted squares 1 mm2; z: the number of counted squares 1 mm2). Calculate the volume of the cell suspension necessary to plate a total amount of 240,000 cells divided into 40,000 cells for each well in the 6-well ultra-low attachment plate.\nNOTE: Be sure to plate the correct number of cells by plating cells into one extra well. Therefore, the total amount of cells to be plated is 280,000 cells.\nPrepare 35 ml SGM by adding 50% of 2% MC (SGM-MC) in a 25 cm2 flask. Prepare the total volume of SGM considering 5 ml extra in order to plate one extra well.\nAdd the calculated volume of the cell suspension to the SGM-MC prepared in the flask and mix gently using a pipette to disperse any clumps. Plate the cells in a 6-well ultra-low attachment plate and use an inverted microscope to observe how the cells appear after being plated.",
    "Incubate the cells in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Every 3 d, add fresh aliquots of bFGF and EGF to each well to refresh the concentration of the growth factors. Add 2 µL bFGF and 5 µL EGF to maintain both at the final concentration of 10 ng/ml in each well.\nIsolation of sarcospheres\nNOTE: Monitor the good progress of the sarcosphere assay at 7, 14, 21, and 28 d to decide when it is necessary to isolate the sarcospheres that formed.\n\t\nPrepare all the reagents and equipment in the laminar flow hood (Figure 3A, B). Assemble the filtration unit by placing a net filter of 25 mm diameter and a 40 µm mesh into a membrane filter holder; sterilize by autoclaving (Figure 4A-E).\nFor each well, transfer the medium containing the sarcospheres to a syringe with a sterile membrane filter holder using a sterile pipette with a 1,000 µL tip. After completely removing the medium containing the sarcospheres, wash the well by adding 5 ml GM to be sure to transfer all the spheres to a syringe. Use the microscope to confirm whether all the sarcospheres have been recovered. If not, proceed by repeating this step .\nFilter the suspension with a membrane filter holder only by gravity without pressure in order to prevent damaging the spheres and to avoid having sarcospheres crossing through the filter, thereby avoiding the loss of spheres. Remove air bubbles by gently using a sterile glass Pasteur pipette.\nNOTE: Sometimes the filtration is blocked by the presence of an air bubble in the membrane filter holder.",
    "Wash the filtration unit by adding 10 ml GM to the syringe and letting it filter without pressure to be sure to eliminate the single cells. Take apart the filter unit from the syringe and put it into a Petri dish.\nRemove the net filter from the membrane filter holder using Perry tweezers and wash it by shaking it gently with the tweezers in a 60 mm Petri dish to release the sarcospheres from the tangle of the membrane. Then, place the membrane in a well and confirm by microscopic observation that there are no more spheres tangled in the membrane. If spheres are still tangled in the membrane, proceed with another wash as described in step 3.2.4.\nObserve the released sarcospheres using a microscope. Incubate the released sarcospheres in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Repeat all steps for each well of a 6-well ultra-low attachment plate.\n4. OS-CSC Lines\nNOTE: OS-CSCs are obtained from the sarcospheres that exhibit adherent expansion by reintroducing and reculturing these cells in a monolayer after they are plated in small 60 mm Petri dishes no longer under ultra-low attachment conditions.\nOS-CSC cultures\nTo enable further growth, subculture cells when they reach approximately 90% confluence in a 60 mm Petri dish. Repeat step 2.2.1 to establish OS-CSC cultures.\nStop trypsinization by adding 4 ml SCGM and wash the dish well, using a pipette to detach all the cells. Transfer the cell suspension to a new 100 mm Petri dish and add 6 ml SCGM. When OS-CSCs reach 90% confluence, subculture by repeating section 2.2.\nNOTE: For in vitro analysis to characterize the stem cell-like phenotype of isolated OS-CSCs, cells can be plated in different types of plates.",
    "Preserve the established OS-CSC lines by cryopreservation (repeat all steps of section 2.3). Defrost the cryopreserved OS-CSCs by repeating all steps of section 2.4.\n5. In vitro Analysis to Characterize OS-CSCs:\nPreparation of cells for immunofluorescence\nNOTE: Cells are fixed in paraformaldehyde when they reach the right grade of confluence in each well of a 24-well plate. The grade of confluence is related to the type of experiments.\n\t\nPlate OS-CSCs in a 24-well plate to study the surface Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) markers by immunofluorescence. Fix cells in each well when they reach 50 - 60% confluence. Remove the SCGM by aspiration and wash twice in a DPBS 24-well plate.\nUnder a chemical hood, add 500 µL 4% PFA/DPBS to each well. Incubate at RT for 10 min. Remove the PFA/DPBS and wash 3x with ultrapure dH2O. Allow the 24-well plate to dry in the fume hood.\nImmunofluorescence for MSC markers\nNOTE: Immunofluorescence staining of the OS-CSCs fixed in 4% PFA/DPBS can be used to investigate the MSC-like phenotype of OS-CSCs using antibodies directed against CD44, Stro-1 and CD105. The following method is used routinely by the authors.\n\t\nIn a chemical hood, permeabilize cells that have been fixed in 4% PFA/DPBS by adding 500 µL 0.2% Triton X-100/DPBS to each well. Incubate the cells at 37°C for 30 min. Gently wash the cells 3x with DPBS. Add 300 µL RNase diluted 1/1,000 with 2% BSA/DPBS to the cells and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.\nGently wash the cells 3x with 2% BSA/DPBS. Stain the cells for MSC markers. Add the primary antibody only to the wells chosen as positive controls for each antibody.",
    "Add 300 µL anti-CD105 diluted 1/10 with 2% BSA/DPBS, 300 µL anti-CD44 diluted 1/10 with 2% BSA/DPBS, 300 µL anti-Stro-1 diluted 1/10 with 2% BSA/DPBS and only 200 µL 2% BSA/DPBS to the wells chosen as negative controls for each antibody.\nIncubate the cells in a humid environment at 4 °C O/N. Wash the wells 3x with DPBS and then twice with 2% BSA/DPBS.\nReveal primary antibodies by adding specific secondary antibodies.\n\t\t\nAdd 300 µL anti-rabbit IgG (donkey anti-rabbit IgG [H + L]) diluted 1/100 with 2% BSA/DPBS into each well chosen as positive and negative control for CD44 and CD105.

Incubate cells in the dark at RT for 60 min. Wash the wells 6x with DPBS.\nStain MSC marker-positive cells for cytoskeletal actin by adding 300 µL phalloidin diluted 1/100 with 2% BSA/DPBS into each well stained for MSC marker immunofluorescence.\nIncubate the cells for 40 min at RT. Wash the wells 3x with DPBS and then wash them twice with ultrapure dH2O. Proceed to the counterstaining of the nuclei after the immunofluorescence staining described above. Prepare propidium iodide solution 10-5 M in DPBS (stock 1.5 x 10-3 M) in a fume hood.\n\t\t\nAdd 200 µL propidium iodide solution to each well colored as described above. Incubate the cells for 2 - 3 min at RT. Wash the wells twice with ultrapure dH2O.\nNOTE: Repeat all the steps of sections 5.1 - 5.2 on the cell line HCT8, a primary continuous differentiated colon cancer cell line that is used as a negative control.\nOsteogenic differentiation assay\n\tNOTE: Osteogenic differentiation lasts for 20 d.",
    "Plate OS-CSCs in 24-well plates at a cell density of 1 x 104 cells/cm2 in SCCGM. Allow the cells to grow in SCGM until they reach 80 - 90% confluency in each well.\nStart osteogenic differentiation by changing the SCGM to OM. Allow the cells to grow in OM and refresh medium every 3 - 4 d. Stop the osteogenic differentiation assay at 10 d to evaluate the presence of alkaline phosphatase (ALP).\nFix cells in 4% PFA/DPBS (See section 5.1). Evaluate the osteoblastic phenotype by cytochemical staining for ALP and for HA using Alizarin Red S staining.\nALP cytochemical staining\nNOTE: Prepare the dye mixture in a chemical hood immediately before starting the staining.\n\t\t\nDissolve 40 mg Fast Blue BB or Fast Red Violet LB salt in 50 ml Tris-HCl, pH 9 (Solution A). Dissolve 5 mg naphthol-AS-MX phosphate sodium salt in 1 ml DMSO (Solution B). Add Solution B entirely to Solution A and mix well, obtaining Solution C. Wash cells twice with DPBS.\nAdd 500 µL - 1 ml Solution C to each well and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Monitor the course of staining every 10 min by observing the cells under the microscope.\nStop the staining when ALP-positive cells become intensely colored (blue with the Fast Blue BB salt or red with Fast Red Violet LB salt), which usually occurs within 30 min. Wash the cells 3x with ultrapure dH2O to remove all residues of Solution C. If a precipitate of the stain is present, wash the cells quickly once with absolute ethanol.\nProceed to the counterstaining of the nuclei after the ALP staining as described in the steps 5.2.5 and 5.2.5.1.\nAlizarin Red S cytochemical staining\nNOTE: Prepare the dye mixture before starting the experiment.",

Wash the cells once with DPBS.\nAdd Alizarin Red S to the cells for only a few sec.\nWash the wells with ultrapure dH2O to control the degree of staining; if the HA deposits are not intensely colored, repeat step 5.3.5.2. Stop the staining when HA deposits become intensely red colored, which usually occurs within few minutes. Wash the wells with ultrapure dH2O.\nAdipogenic differentiation\nNOTE: Assay duration depends on the OS-CSC lines. The assay can last 14 - 30 d.\n\t\nPlate OS-CSCs in 24-well plates at a cell density of 1 x 104 cells/cm2 in SCGM. Allow the cells to grow in SCGM until they reach 80 - 90% confluency in each well. Initiate adipogenic differentiation by changing the SCGM to AM. Allow the cells to grow in AM and refresh the AM twice a week.\nStop the adipogenic differentiation assay when lipid vesicles are visible.
