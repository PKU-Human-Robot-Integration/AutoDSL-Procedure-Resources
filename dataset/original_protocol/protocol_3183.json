Please see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] and problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nAfter centrifugation, carefully discard the supernatant by manual aspiration, taking care not to dislodge the specimen:\nTransfer the sample to a sterile 10 cm tissue culture dish pre-cooled on ice by tapping the inverted tube onto the dish.\nEnsure the tissue does not dry out in the subsequent steps, adding additional PBS as needed.\nWorking quickly, use a scalpel blade to finely mince the tissue (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2955-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Images of an Osteosarcoma tissue specimen before and after mincing\nOnce the tissue is finely minced, collect the minced tissue into a 50 mL falcon tube:\nTransfer of the minced tissue by tilting the dish at an angle and rinsing the dish with 10 mL of PBS with a 25 mL serological pipette.",
    "Repeat this process until all tissue has been collected into the conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nNote: Pre-wet all serological pipettes and filtered pipette tips with PBS just before use to prevent tissue specimen lodging to the walls of the plasticware.\nAfter centrifugation, discard the supernatant by carefully but swiftly decanting directly into the waste container without disturbing the pellet.\nAdd the activated papain solution to the minced tissue and incubate at 37°C in a water bath for 15–20 min.\nSwirl the tube every 5 min to ensure the entire surface area of the tissue is exposed to the papain solution (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2955-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Tissue specimen undergoing dissociation with complete papain solution\nAfter incubation, add an aliquot of DNase to the tissue and mix by gently swirling the tube.\nAdd 20 mL of DMEM/F12 wash media to the tissue and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 25°C.\nAfter centrifugation, discard the supernatant. If red blood cells are observed in the cell pellet, perform red blood cell lysis:\nAdd 5 mL of ACK lysis buffer to the cell pellet for 1 min.\nQuench with 20 mL of cold HBSS.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nAfter centrifugation, discard the supernatant by carefully decanting into waste (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2955-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Cell pellet before (left panel) and after (right panel) red blood cell lysis\nUsing a 10 mL serological pipette, introduce 3 mL of wash media and triturate the cell pellet until the no visible large pieces are observed. If large pieces remain, repeat enzymatic dissociation described in step 7.\nPerform a cell count of the cell solution according to your laboratory’s general protocol.",
    "Seed 1–2 million cells per well in a cell culture treated 6-well plate format.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2955_8.csv\n∗Defined in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nNote: In establishing the Childhood Cancer Model Atlas (CCMA),1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] we have identified specific media conditions which enable long term growth of the various cancer types included in our atlas. Seed dissociated tumor cells using as many conditions as possible, prioritizing the media conditions as indicated in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nCryopreserve 1–3 million cells per vial (cryopreserving media: 500 μL FBS, 100 μL DMSO, 400 μL cell solution) in a Mr Frosty freezing container at −80°C for at least 12 h before transferring to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 and monitor cells according to the next steps below.\nCell maintenance post-tissue processing\nTiming: 1 h\nThe steps below describe the procedure of cell maintenance at early stages (1–4 weeks) of cell line establishment.\nNote: Growth following dissociation can take from a few days to several weeks. Cultures which have not after 2 months are unlikely to result in viable cell line models and can be discarded.\nAt 24 h or 48 h post-seeding, supplement with 1 mL of fresh complete media to each well. At this stage, cells are more likely to remain in suspension than adhere to the plate.\nEvery 2–3 days post-tissue dissociation, perform a half media change as cytokines released from the cells may be beneficial for growth to the surrounding cells.\nIf cells are in suspension (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]), tilt the 6-well plate at an angle, allowing the cells to settle to the bottom for 5 min.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2955-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "If cells are adhering to the plate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]), proceed to step 3.\nDiscard the conditioned media from the top by removing 500 μL of volume at a time until half of the initial volume is removed from each well. Supplement with fresh complete media of the same volume removed.\nMonitor the cell growth and perform the half media change every 2–3 days. Once cells have expanded in size and number over time (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), proceed to the protocol for cell maintenance and expansion for long-term culture outlined below.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2955-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Representative images of medulloblastoma (sample 1) and neuroblastoma (sample 2) cells following dissociation at early and late time points\nCell maintenance and expansion for long-term culture\nTiming: 1 h\nThe steps below describe the cell culture protocol for cell line models after achieving stable in vitro growth\nCell line models can be expanded indefinitely through regular cell passaging. Passaging should be performed at least once or up to three times per week to avoid over-confluency. Cells at low passage should be expanded and frozen to limit changes associated with long-term in vitro passage.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Please see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nAdherent models\nNote: Passaging should be performed according to whether the cell line is adherent or suspension. Adherent cell lines should be passaged before reaching 90% confluency. Suspension cell lines should be passaged when an opaque center starts to become visible in the majority of spheres.\nUsing a serological pipette, aspirate media and discard into a waste container with 10% bleach solution.\nRinse cells with PBS, making sure not to disrupt cells, then aspirate and discard the PBS into the waste container.\nAdd 1–2 mL Accutase to the cells and incubate at 37°C for 3–5 min or until cells have visibly detached.",
    "Dilute Accutase by addition of 5× volume of PBS and collect cells into a 50 mL falcon tube. Centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min.\nAfter centrifugation, discard the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1–5 mL of complete media, performing cell counts and seeding as required.\nNote: Cell lines which expand past passage 3 should be sequenced using whole genome and RNA sequencing to confirm identity by comparison to the originating tumor.\nSuspension models\nUsing a sterile serological pipette, collect all media into a 50 mL falcon tube.\nRinse the surface of the tissue culture plate with PBS and collect all solution into the same falcon tube. Centrifuge the tube at 300 × g for 5 min.\nAfter centrifugation, discard the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of Accutase, then incubate at 37°C for 3–5 min.\nFollowing incubation, manually dissociate spheroids by triturating the solution up and down using a 1 mL pipette. If visible clumps remain, perform additional incubation and manual dissociation steps as required.\nDilute Accutase by addition of 5× volume of PBS then centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min.\nAfter centrifugation, discard the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\nResuspend cell pellet in 1–5 mL of complete media, performing cell counts and seeding as required."
