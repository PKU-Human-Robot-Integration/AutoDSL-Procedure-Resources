  "procedures": [
    "Inoculate the yeast strain harboring Hsf1-FLAG-V5 in a culture tube containing 3 ml YPD liquid media (see Recipes) and grow overnight at 30 °C in a shaker set at 200 rpm. Dilute 2 ml overnight grown culture into the 500 ml flask containing 100 ml YPD media, and grow to OD600 = 0.5-0.8 OD at 30 °C in a shaker set at 200 rpm (~4 h).Pour the growth media into two 50 ml Falcon tubes, and centrifuge at 4,000 x g for 4 min. Discard the media and submerge the Falcon tubes containing the yeast pellets in liquid nitrogen. The pellets can be stored at -80 °C for up to 3 months.Add dry ice pellets into a cryogenic tissue grinder pre-chilled at 4 °C (a simple coffee grinder will work as well) and grind it into powder that covers the blades. The dry ice allows the cells to be lysed while remaining frozen. Dry ice should be handled with care and never confined in an airtight compartment.Add the yeast pellets to the crushed dry ice and grind the yeast pellet with the dry ice for 30 sec.Repeat the grinding 5 more times for a total of 6 grindings. Add more dry ice pellets as needed to keep the blades fully covered with dry ice.Transfer the pulverized cells/dry ice powder into beaker, and sublimate/evaporate dry ice at room temperature.Add 1 ml lysis buffer and incubate the lysate at 4 °C for 5 min with intermittent swirling to resuspend.Transfer the lysate into a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube, and centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 10 min. Reserve the supernatant (cleared lysate). Take a 10 µl sample of the cleared lysate for analysis by Western blot (input sample).Add 25 µl anti-FLAG magnetic beads to a 1.5 ml tube.",
    "Place the tube on a magnetic separation rack and remove the buffer. Wash with 200 µl lysis buffer (see Recipes) on the magnetic rack and discard the wash.Pipet the cleared lysate into the 1.5 ml tube containing the anti-FLAG beads and incubate at 4 °C for 2 h on an inversion rotating mixer.Place the tube on the magnetic separation rack. When the solution clears (~2 min), take a 10 µl sample for analysis by Western blot (unbound sample).Discard the unbound fraction and wash the beads 3 times with 500 µl lysis buffer. Gently vortex the beads with each wash step and incubate on ice for 5 min. Return to the magnetic separation rack and discard washes.Elute the Hsf1-FLAG-V5 complex with 500 µl lysis buffer containing 100 µg/ml 3xFLAG peptide. Incubate on ice for 30 min. Repeat for a total of 2 elutions, and pool the eluate fractions.Add 25 µl anti-V5 magnetic beads to a 1.5 ml tube. Place the tube on a magnetic separation rack and remove the buffer. Wash with 200 µl lysis buffer on the magnetic rack and discard the wash.Pipet the pooled 3xFLAG eluate into the tube with the V5 beads and incubate at 4 °C for 2 h on an inversion rotating mixer.Place the tube on the magnetic separation rack. Discard the unbound fraction and wash the beads 3 times with 500 µl lysis buffer. Vortex the beads at half-maximal setting for 5 sec with each wash step and incubate on ice for 5 min. Return to the magnetic separation rack and discard washes.Add 100 µl lysis buffer + 2% SDS. Incubate for 15 min at 95 °C. Place tube on the magnetic separation rack and reserve solution.",
    "Use 10 µl for analysis by Western blot (final eluate: this is 10x concentrated compared to input and unbound fraction).Submit remaining 90 µl samples to a mass spectrometry core facility (e.g., Whitehead Institute Proteomics Facility) for analysis as described (Zheng et al., 2016). Mass spectrometry is extremely sensitive to contamination by proteases, so wearing gloves, working quickly and keeping samples on ice prior to analysis is of paramount importance."
