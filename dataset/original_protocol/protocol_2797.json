    "Equilibrate Mono Q column in a AKTA FPLC (GE) system with Tris-NaCl buffer A. Inject samples into a Mono Q column and collect the flow through. Add more Tris-NaCl buffer A in batches depending on the capacity of the column and collect 15 more fractions.\nNote: In our experiment, each fraction had roughly 1.5 mL.\nNote: tRBD is generated as a secreted protein from HEK-293T cells into the growth media, which contains several proteins and a large amount of BSA. tRBD has a predicted PI of 8.7–8.8, with a positive charge. However, our attempt to purify tRBD using a Mono S cation exchange column proved unsuccessful as other unknown proteins as well as large amounts of BSA in the culture medium co-eluted with tRBD. Our major contaminant was BSA, which has a PI of 4.5–5.0, which, in theory, is not expected to bind to Mono S column. It is possible that the large amount of BSA in the FBS added to the culture medium was non-specifically sticking to the column. On the other hand, we found that tRBD does not bind to the Mono Q anion exchange column, which bound well to BSA and other proteins. Based on this, we performed a negative selection approach for tRBD using Mono Q column, which trapped most of the BSA and other proteins. tRBD was present mainly in early flowthrough fractions 3–8, collected in the equilibration buffer A (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). This is a customized purification protocol for tRBD. For other options to optimize elution of the protein of interest please see troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Elute proteins bound to Mono Q column using a salt gradient generated using Tris-NaCl buffer B, which contains 1 M NaCl. Carefully adjust the flow rate of buffer A and buffer B to obtain a salt gradient over time to elute proteins binding to the column with varying affinity. Depending on the protein content in the eluate, determine the number of fractions to be collected.\nNote: In this protocol, we collected 25 more fractions in which no significant target protein content was observed in the eluates.\nNote: Proteins eluted from the Mono Q column with Tris-NaCl buffer B contained no tRBD. The eluate can be discarded or kept as a negative or background control. This step will clean the column and keep it in good condition. Following this step, wash the column with 4 column volumes of distilled water, and then equilibrate with 4 column volumes of degassed 20% ethanol for its future use.\nSample preparation and gel running\nTake 30 μL from each fraction. Dilute with 10 μL 4× Laemmli buffer. Boil at 95°C for 5 min. Vortex and quickly spin down samples in a tabletop centrifuge for 5 min at 10,000 g.\nNote: Do not place samples on ice after this step, as samples have been denatured.\nClip the previously prepared 10% polyacrylamide gel into a gel runner tank.\nPour the 1× Running Buffer into the gel running tank chamber, ensuring that the buffer covers the top of the gel. Load the samples from step 27 into the gel.\nPlace the safety lid with electrodes over the entire apparatus. Plug the electrodes into a power pack and run gel for 100V for 10 min, then 200V for 55 min at 21°C–25°C.\nSubmerge an open Transfer Cassette plate into a tray with 1× transfer buffer.",

Adjust the buffer level until 1× transfer buffer submerges the necessary level within the tank.\nMove the power pack and transfer tank to 4°C or place it in an ice tray to prevent over heating. Connect the electrodes into the power pack. Run for 1 h at a constant voltage of 100V.\nNote: We used constant voltage for transfer because it ensures constant field strength offering most efficient tank blotting method. This method was ideal for the proteins studied here. If suboptimal transfer efficiency is observed, please refer to other options provided under troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nImmunoblot nitrocellulose membrane with an antibody detecting the HIS or FLAG tag or RBD itself.\nPool and aliquot purified tRBD\nNote the fractions from ion exchange chromatography that contain tRBD. Pool fractions containing purified tRBD (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: We pooled fractions ∼3–8. More nonspecific proteins were often present in later fractions following FPLC, which resulted in poor tRBD protein purification (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nDialyze and concentrate protein elution as described above.\nPause point: Aliquot purified tRBD.

Vortex and quickly spin down samples in a tabletop mini-centrifuge for at least 5 s.\nResolve on SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane.\nDensitometry analysis\nAnalyze western blot bands using the Gel Analyzer tool of ImageJ (NIH).\nPrepare standard curve using densitometry values of known concentrations of commercially available recombinant RBD (Sino Biological).\nNote: In this protocol we used Western blotting and densitometry to quantify RBD concentration. Therefore, we used commercial monomeric HIS-RBD as a standard and performed relative quantification of the trimeric HIS-RBD using anti-HIS antibody to simultaneously detect both proteins. Standard curve may also be prepared with known concentrations of bovine serum albumin (BSA) as an economical alternative option. However, if Western blotting and densitometry is used for quantification, using BSA will require the use of two different antibodies, i.e., one for BSA and one for the protein of interest, which may not give accurate signal intensity because of differences in the efficiency of antibodies used, thus skewing quantification of concentrations.\nPlot densitometry values against known RBD concentrations.\nCalculate regression equation.\nCalculate concentrations of tRBD conditioned media and purified tRBD by inputting the obtained densitometry value into the obtained regression equation.\nConfirm trimeric nature of purified tRBD\nTiming: 1 day\nThis section describes validation of the trimeric nature of the purified RBD.\nUsage of the modified leucine zipper allows for the trimerization of protein constructs.

Heat sample at 95°C for 5 min.\nNote: As a control, prepare a sample of purified tRBD as stated above and add 9 μL of 4× Laemmli Sample buffer with BME as a reducing agent. Addition of BME to the Laemmli sample buffer will reduce the disulfide bonds and unfold the native conformation of the proteins in the sample facilitating its migration in the gel.\nResolve samples on 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane. Probe with antibody detecting HIS or FLAG tag or RBD itself.\nNote: In its trimeric form, RBD will have a molecular weight of around 95 kDa while monomeric RBD will be around 37 kDa.\nNote: Monomeric and trimeric proteins may also be comparatively analyzed without glutaraldehyde crosslinking using non-reducing native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.\nAssess ability of engineered tRBD to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral entry\nTiming: 5–6 days\nThis section accomplishes validation of the potential of tRBD to block SARS-CoV-2 infection in a pseudovirus assay and in a true virus infection assay.\ntRBD inhibition of pseudotyped lentivral particles with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein\nThis section of the protocol is modified from a previous publication.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] It assesses the ability of the engineered tRBD to inhibit entry of a SARS-CoV-2 psuedovirus into ACE2-expressing cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).
