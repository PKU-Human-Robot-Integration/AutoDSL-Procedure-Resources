ICV HEF2 expression and purification workflow\nFor expression, the ICV HEF2 pET46 Ek/LIC vector was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. A single colony was inoculated into a 1-L LB broth culture and induced with IPTG to express the ICV HEF2 protein. E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed using a hydraulic cell disruption system. The protein was then purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography. ICV HEF2 eluted from the gel filtration column as a trimer. Long and short constructs of ICV HEF2 variants (HEF495-586 Q558C, HEF495-586 H518C, HEF481-621 Q558C and HEF481-621 H518C) were expressed and purified for the study; for more details, please refer to (Serrão et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). The figure was generated with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nTransform the pET46 Ek/LIC plasmid encoding N-terminal 6xHis-tagged ICV HEF2 into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells for expression as described in step 11 in the ‘before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]’ section. Plate cells on a LB-agar Amp plate and grow at 37°C for at least 12 h.\nInoculate a single colony in 5 mL LB broth with a final concentration of 100 μg/mL ampicillin in a 17 x 100 mm disposable culture tube to produce an E. coli starter culture. Incubate at 37°C for 16 h in an Eppendorf Excella E24R orbital shaker at 180 rpm.\nInoculate 1 L of LB broth containing a final concentration of 100 μg/mL ampicillin with 5 mL of the E. coli starter culture and incubate at 37°C in an Eppendorf Excella E24R orbital shaker at 180 rpm until optical density at 600 nm (O.D.600nm) is ∼0.6.",
    "Add IPTG to a final concentration of 0.5 mM to induce protein expression.\nIncubate at 18°C for 20 h in a high-capacity refrigerated Eppendorf I26R orbital shaker at 180 rpm.\nHarvest the cells by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm using a Fiberlite F10S-4x1000 LEX rotor (3,000g) in a Sorvall RC6+ high-capacity centrifuge for 45 min at 4°C.\nPause point: Pelleted cells can be stored at −80°C for 6 months.\nResuspend the harvested cells in 30 mL of pre-chilled Buffer A (recipe in step 3d, preparation of stock solutions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1]).\nLyse the cells at 30,000 psi using a Constant Systems TS-series 0.75 cell disruption system.\nCritical: The cell lysate should be kept cold (either at 4°C or on ice) during cell lysis and purification to prevent protein denaturation.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 13,500 rpm using a Fiberlite F21-8x50y rotor (21,600g) in a Sorvall RC6+ high-capacity centrifuge for 45 min at 4°C to remove cell debris.\nDecant the supernatant and filter using a low-protein binding 0.22-μm PES syringe filter.\nUsing a 15 x 200 mm gravity flow open column, pack a 3 mL bed volume of Ni-NTA resin and equilibrate with 10 column volumes Buffer A.\nApply the ICV HEF2-containing clarified lysate by gravity onto the 3 mL Ni-NTA column at 4°C.\nCritical: Once cells are lysed, the lysate should be applied onto a Ni-NTA column as soon as possible.\nWash the resin with 15 column volumes Buffer B (recipe in step 3e, preparation of stock solutions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1]).\nCritical: During step 13, additional Buffer B may be used to wash the resin to eliminate non-specifically bound contaminating proteins.\nElute ICV HEF2 using 5 column volumes Buffer C (recipe in step 3f, preparation of stock solutions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1]).",
    "Remove the 6xHis tag using restriction-grade thrombin. Add 1 U thrombin per 1 mg protein to the eluate from step 14. Dialyze the thrombin-protein mixture against 1 L Buffer D (recipe in step 3g, preparation of stock solutions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1]) at 4°C for 16 h using 12–14 kDa MWCO dialysis tubing.\nCritical: High concentrations of imidazole found in the Ni-NTA elution buffer (Buffer C) are inhibitory to thrombin enzymatic activity. It is important to lower the concentrations of imidazole by dialysis either before or during thrombin digestion. Also, thrombin is effectively inhibited by 1 mM PMSF; do not use serine protease inhibitors during thrombin digestion.\nCritical: It is recommended to use restriction grade quality thrombin for cleavage of the His-tag. Non-restriction grade quality thrombin may contain additional proteases that can non-specifically cleave the protein of interest.\nConcentrate dialyzed ICV HEF2 to 1 mL using an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal concentrator (10 kDa MWCO), pre-equilibrated with Buffer D, at a speed of 3,800 rpm at 4°C in a TX-750 swinging bucket rotor (3,150g) in a Sorvall XTR benchtop centrifuge.\nInject sample onto a custom packed Superdex 75 prep grade resin XK 16/40 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with 2 column volumes Buffer D at a flow rate of 1 mL/min using an Akta Pure FPLC system. Monitor elution fractions by absorbance at 280 nm.\nNote: The protein can also be purified using a commercially pre-packed Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 gel filtration column.\nPool protein-containing fractions and concentrate to ∼1.8 mg/mL using an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit (10 kDa MWCO) at a speed of 3,800 rpm using a TX-750 swinging bucket rotor (3,150g) in a Sorvall XTR benchtop centrifuge at 4°C.",
    "Quantify protein concentration by determining absorbance at 280 nm on a NanoDrop 2000c or another equivalent spectrophotometer. Use the Beer-Lambert law and the theoretical molar extinction coefficient of the protein to calculate the protein concentration.\nNote: The theoretical molar extinction coefficient can be calculated from the protein sequence using web servers such as Expasy ProtParam.\nAnalyze protein purity by 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Stain gel for 10 min with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 stain and destain in 10% (v/v) acetic acid.\nPause point: Purified ICV HEF2 can be stored at 4°C for up to 10 days without any aggregation or protein precipitation.\nSite-directed bimane labeling and fluorescence data acquisition\nTiming: 2 days\nAliquot 0.5 mL of 1.8 mg/mL purified ICV HEF2 (equivalent to 100 μM) from step 18 into pre-chilled 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nAdd 55 μL of freshly prepared 100 mM mBBr stock (recipe in step 4, preparation of stock solutions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1]) to the purified ICV HEF2 (final concentration 0.5 mM mBBr). The mBBr is added in 5-fold molar excess to the protein sample for labeling.\nIncubate the sample for 2 h at 22°C in the dark to avoid fluorophore degradation.\nCritical: Keep the labeling reaction in the dark using aluminum foil to ensure mBBr stability and to maximize labeling efficiency.\nNote: The solution should be slightly orange with a weak green tinge.",
    "Critical: mBBr is soluble in acetonitrile; however, acetonitrile may be detrimental to protein stability. It is important to examine the protein sample for precipitation before continuing. The labeling time, reaction temperature, and mBBr:protein ratio may need to be optimized to prevent or reduce protein precipitation. Circular dichroism wavelength scans and thermal melts may be used to determine whether protein structure or stability was affected by bimane labeling (Jones Brunette and Farrens, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Serrão et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Taraska et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nRemove excess, unreacted mBBr on a 5 mL Hi-Trap Desalting column, pre-equilibrated with 20 column volumes of Buffer D (see step 3g, preparation of stock solutions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1]), using a flow rate of 1 mL/min.\nMeasure the A280 for each eluted fraction from the Desalting column and pool the fractions containing the protein. Concentrate using an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit (10 kDa MWCO) by centrifuging at a speed of 3,800 rpm in a TX-750 swinging bucket rotor (3,150g) at 4°C in a Sorvall XTR benchtop centrifuge.\nPause point: Bimane-labeled ICV HEF2 can be stored in the dark using aluminum foil at 4°C for up to 24 h without loss of fluorescence signal.\nDilute bimane-labeled ICV HEF2 to 0.5 mg/mL in the buffer with desired pH, as described in the ‘preparation of stock solutions[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1]’ section (step 4).\nCalculate labeling efficiency as a ratio of moles of protein labeled with bimane over moles of unlabeled protein samples. Measure the UV absorbance at wavelength 295 nm (specific for tryptophan absorption) and 390 nm (specific for bimane absorption) using a NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer. Calculate the labeling efficiency using the following equation:",

Samples should be prepared in at least independent triplicates (plate map shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1215-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative TrIQ plate setup\nICV HEF2 Q558C-bimane or H518C-bimane at various pH values from 4.5 to 7.5 are pipet into a 96-well synthetic quartz plate. Technical triplicates are set up for each independently expressed, purified, and labeled batch of protein. A minimum of three independent replicates are measured. Free monobromobimane (mBBr) and buffer are included in technical triplicates as controls. This figure was generated with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].",
    "Critical: Care should be taken to ensure that the 96-well quartz plate or the cuvette is properly cleaned before loading each sample. Residual bimane-labeled protein will result in inconsistent readings. Incubate the plate or cuvette in 2% (v/v) Hellmanex III for 20 min, rinse well with doubly distilled H2O, and use N2 gas or compressed air to dry the plate thoroughly between samples.\nCritical: It is recommended to use a synthetic quartz microplate rather than black polystyrene 96-well plates, as the quartz microplate provides the lowest auto-fluorescence/background.\nNote: Fluorescence measurements can also be performed using a 10-mm pathlength quartz cuvette on an ISS PC1 photon-counting spectrofluorometer with an “L” configuration or equivalent spectrofluorometer. The use of a 10-mm pathlength quartz cuvette will improve the signal-noise ratio and signal quality but will increase the time required to complete data collection.\nMeasure the fluorescence of bimane-labeled ICV HEF2 using a Synergy Neo2 multimode plate reader or equivalent fluorescence plate reader at 22°C. Set fluorescence excitation wavelength to 395 (± 5) nm and perform data acquisition in the top-to-top mode with autogain. Collect the emission spectra from 425 to 600 nm with a 1-nm monochromator step and 0.5–1 nm bandwidth, depending on the signal intensity. Set acquisition time to 100 ms and 10 integrations.\nCritical: An initial measurement using only Buffer D and the sample at pH 7.5 should be performed to set the autogain function and determine the background profile. The slit and bandwidths can affect the intensity readings. The slit and bandwidths should be optimized for the bimane-labeled protein and kept constant for all experiments.",
    "Note: Experiments should be repeated in at least triplicates with independently expressed and purified batches of protein. Each data point should be measured in technical triplicates. An independent replicate is defined as a protein sample that is independently expressed, purified, and bimane-labeled.\nMeasure free mBBr (final concentration 850 μM) at various pH values as a reference control.\nData processing and statistical analysis\nTiming: 4–8 h\nNote: We recommend using Origin 2017 for initial data processing and GraphPad v9.0 for advanced statistical analysis (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nBuffer subtract the acquired technical triplicate data using the reference values obtained from the Buffer D fluorescence scan and average the replicates.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1215-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Representative TrIQ data\n(A) Experimental fluorescence emission spectra for free mBBr and the buffer control. For free mBBr, data are expressed as the average of four independent buffer-subtracted replicates ± SEM.\n(B) Experimental fluorescence emission spectra of ICV HEF2 Q558C-bimane normalized from 0 to 1. Data from four independent replicates were averaged and buffer subtracted ± SEM. The maximum fluorescence intensity was used in subsequent F/F0 quenching factor calculations.\n(C) The fluorescence quenching factor of ICV HEF2 Q558C-bimane TrIQ as a function of pH. At pH values > 6.5 and < 5.5, no quenching was observed, suggesting no interactions between W562 and W584. Fluorescence quenching was observed at pH 5.5–6.0, indicating an interaction between W562 and W584 and the formation of the second chain reversal region.\n(D) Statistical analysis of the change in TrIQ F/F0 quenching fraction values as a function of pH are presented as mean ± SEM. One-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey post-hoc comparison test was used for statistical analysis: n.s.= not significant (p > 0.05); ∗ p < 0.0001; ∗∗ p < 0.001. These figure panels are adapted from (Serrão et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).",
    "Normalize the data from 0 to 1.\nAverage the normalized independent replicates and calculate the standard error of the mean (SEM).\nCalculate the quenching factor (F/F0) for each pH as follows:\n    (  F  F 0   )  i  =    (   I  m a x , λ    I  0 ,  λ    )  i   \nwhere Imax,λ is the normalized maximum fluorescence emission value at the wavelength (λ), and I0,λ is the normalized maximum fluorescence emission value of the free-mBBr reference at the same wavelength.\nCritical: Since the maximum fluorescence intensity (Imax λ) value is arbitrarily defined by the user, it is important to be consistent with the decision for selection of the wavelength value.\nPerform a one-way ANOVA (Donaldson, 1966[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Winkler, 1975[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]) on the F/F0 quenching fraction to determine whether there are statistically significant differences between pH groups.\nPerform a Tukey’s post-hoc test (Tukey, 1949[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]) to determine whether there are statistically different groups.\nEstimate the average Cα-Cα distance between the probe and tryptophan residues using the calculated ICV HEF2 quenching fraction (F/F0). Based on the obtained calculated quenching fraction, this can be compared with the average Cα-Cα distance values as a function of quenching fraction, as previously listed in (Jones Brunette and Farrens, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12])."
