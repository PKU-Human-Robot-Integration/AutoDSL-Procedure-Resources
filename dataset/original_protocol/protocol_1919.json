    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nWe developed a fluorescence polarization assay for monitoring BAX early-activation (abbreviated as \"FLAMBE\"; see Gelles et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) in which a TAMRA-labeled BAK-BH3 peptide (BAKTAMRA) binds to, but does not activate, BAX (Czabotar et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Dewson et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Binding of BAKTAMRA to BAX results in an increase in Polarization over time, reaching a plateau as the maximum number of heterodimers form (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], dotted line). In samples exhibiting BAX activation, intramolecular rearrangements within BAX are accompanied by a concomitant release of BAKTAMRA and a decrease in Polarization signal over time (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], solid line). At any given time, the Polarization value represents the population fraction of BAKTAMRA bound to BAX, and therefore indicates the fraction of activated BAX following dissociation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], right). We have validated that changes in Polarization reflect the binding status of BAKTAMRA and fully characterized the FLAMBE technique in Gelles et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1515-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic of BAX and BAKTAMRA interactions within FLAMBE\nFor this assay, we use a TAMRA-labeled BAKBH3 peptide (BAKTAMRA) and monitor changes in Polarization as a consequence of binding to BAX. As the BAX population binds BAKTAMRA, Polarization increases and plateaus if the entire population is heterodimeric (dotted line). Upon BAX activation, BAKTAMRA is displaced resulting in a decrease in Polarization over time as the population of unbound BAKTAMRA molecules increases (solid line). This diagram is reproduced and adapted from Gelles et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5].",
    "This section details three types of titration experiments to monitor BAX activation, and can be used sequentially as a workflow to determine the effect of a candidate ligand on BIMBH3-induced BAX activation. All assays must be performed in a black 96-well microplate and step-by-step details and timing for each major experiment are provided. It is recommended that experimental samples do not exceed duplicates to avoid delays in preparing replicates (see the limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations] section for more details). Typical investigations will include a BAX titration and a 2- or 3-component assay (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The experimental wells must be in consecutive columns and every experiment must include a BAKTAMRA control. Investigators must also include a \"0\" control, which represents the \"0\" concentration of the titrant (commonly BAX+BAKTAMRA, but may include additional components that constitute the background). To reduce pipetting error across duplicates, we recommend using a multi-channel pipette when performing the serial dilution of BAX or a titrant (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). To capture the rapid binding kinetics of BAKTAMRA, we recommend using a PCR plate (or similar) as a reagent reservoir to quickly add BAKTAMRA (or other components) to all wells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1515-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Model plate layouts for FLAMBE assays\n(A) A BAX titration may be performed in duplicate as a 7-point dilution series (blue) and a BAKTAMRA control (red).\n(B) 2-component assays include BAX (blue) and a titrant (yellow). This may be set up as a 2-column (left) or 3-column (right) assay, facilitating either a 6-point or 8-point titration, respectively.\n(C) 3-component assays include BAX (blue), a ligand (green), and a titrant (purple).\nThe Gen5 software only permits selection of consecutive wells; therefore, gray wells are designated for additional controls or empty wells that will be read during the assay.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1515-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Setting up a FLAMBE assay",
    "(A) We recommend investigators perform a serial dilution of the titrant in duplicate using a multi-channel pipette. The final dilution volume must be discarded to obtain the correct volume in the final dilution wells.\n(B) To capture rapid binding kinetics of BAKTAMRA, we recommend using a PCR plate as a reagent reservoir for quickly adding additional components and/or BAKTAMRA. Since BAKTAMRA is the probe, it must be added last before running the assay to capture binding kinetics.\nDetermine an appropriate BAX concentration for downstream investigations\nTiming: 70–80 min\nStudying BAX is a bit of a Catch-22 – sufficient protein is necessary to achieve and detect robust activation kinetics, but BAX may exhibit concentration-dependent auto-activation despite the absence of an activator. The ideal BAX concentration for FLAMBE experiments is just below the auto-activating point; this will ensure that downstream assays resolve the activation kinetics in response to activators or modulators. However, certain experiments may benefit from using BAX at a slightly activating concentration (e.g., inhibition studies). Diligent characterization of BAX concentrations within FLAMBE allows the user to calibrate downstream investigations and mitigates any variability that may arise between protein batches, concentration determination, or protein aggregation during prolonged storage at −80°C. Investigators should perform this experiment on each day of investigation using fresh aliquots of BAKTAMRA and recombinant BAX (see problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5] in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).\nKeep 0.5× PBS on ice.\nPrepare assay reagents.\nPrepare BAX.\nThaw a freezer stock of BAX protein on ice. Since BAX may precipitate out of solution, we recommend centrifuging at 2,000 × g for 10 s at 4°C to pellet any large precipitates and pipetting only soluble protein.",
    "Note: Depending on the volume of the BAX aliquots, multiple tubes may be required to obtain the appropriate volume for the titration. We recommend thawing all tubes on ice and pooling the aliquots into one tube before use.\nPrepare 320 μL of a 500 nM (4×) working stock of BAX in 0.5× PBS and keep on ice.\nNote: In our experience, a maximum of 125 nM (final concentration) BAX in this assay is sufficiently auto-activating such that initial binding kinetics are minimally detectable. Due to variability in protein quality or purification, investigators may find that a higher or lower maximum concentration may be more appropriate.\nNote: This volume is sufficient to aliquot 150 μL into the first duplicate wells of the serial dilution with 20 μL extra to account for human/pipetting error.\nPrepare BAKTAMRA.\nThaw a 2.2 μL aliquot of 0.5 mM BAKTAMRA on the benchtop or at 25°C.\nPrepare a 1 μM master stock of BAKTAMRA by mixing 998 μL of 0.5× PBS and 2 μL of the 0.5 mM BAKTAMRA freezer stock. Keep on ice and protected from light.\nNote: The master stock may be stored at 4°C and used for 1–2 additional days if protected from light, but may suffer a slight decrease in peptide quality (see problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section). Investigators may reuse these stocks at their discretion.\nPrepare a 200 nM (4×) working stock of BAKTAMRA by mixing 560 μL of 0.5× PBS and 140 μL of the 1 μM BAKTAMRA stock. Keep on ice and protected from light.",
    "Note: Investigators will have a surplus of the BAKTAMRA master stock, so for each experiment prepare the 200 nM working stock in 700 μL, which is sufficient to aliquot 25 μL per well in three columns and includes 100 μL extra to avoid pipetting errors when loading and pipetting from the PCR plate.\nPrepare a 1.2× serial dilution of BAX in duplicate in the plate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nNote: We suggest a 1.2× dilution as this will provide sufficient resolution for investigators to identify the ideal concentration of BAX for their downstream assays. While larger dilution factors may test a greater range of concentrations, the loss in resolution will likely result in users having to randomly select a concentration between those tested for downstream assays, which affects reproducibility.\nAliquot 150 μL of the 4× BAX stock into duplicate wells in row A.\nAdd 25 μL of 0.5× PBS to duplicate wells in rows B–H.\nUsing a multi-channel pipette, serially dilute BAX in 125 μL from row A to row G (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Discard the final 125 μL from row G to obtain the correct final volume of 25 μL per well.\nNote: Mix well by pipetting up and down several times before continuing to the next row. Avoid generating bubbles.\nNote: It is recommended to confine FP assays to 7-point dilutions positioned vertically from rows A–G; row H is the BAKTAMRA control (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). In cases where investigators need to assess a larger range of BAX concentrations, 11 dilutions may be organized horizontally across the plate, with the BAKTAMRA control in column 12.\nUsing a multi-channel pipette, add 50 μL of 0.5× PBS to all wells.",
    "Critical: Investigators should initiate the FP protocol prior to the addition of BAKTAMRA in the next step (see steps 12–15 of the before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section).\nUsing a multi-channel pipette, quickly add 25 μL of the 200 nM BAKTAMRA working stock to all wells and immediately proceed to the next step.\nCritical: This step must be completed as quickly as possible to capture rapid binding kinetics. It is recommended to aliquot the BAKTAMRA working stock in 8 wells of a PCR plate (or similar) and use a multi-channel pipette to add BAKTAMRA column-by-column (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). We recommend aliquoting 87.5 μL of BAKTAMRA into 8 wells of a PCR plate to ensure sufficient excess and limit pipetting errors or delays.\nNote: We have found that keeping all reagents on ice prior to plate setup minimizes molecular interactions among reagents prior to running the assay. This ensures detection of initial binding kinetics.\nNote: The final concentration of BAKTAMRA per well is 50 nM. The final BAX concentration range for this described setup is 42–125 nM.\nNote: The final volume per well is 100 μL.\nLoad the plate onto the tray and initiate the assay by clicking \"OK\". The assay will run for 1 h. Following assay completion, the plate will be ejected. Save the exported file. Visualize kinetic data in GraphPad Prism, Microsoft Excel, or a similar program to determine an appropriate concentration of BAX with which to proceed (see expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] section and Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A for more details).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1515-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Experimental kinetic FLAMBE data",
    "(A) BAKTAMRA (50 nM) was added to BAX (42–125 nM) and fluorescence polarization was measured. Stable BAX:BAKTAMRA heterodimer formation is observed at lower concentrations (purple and blue data). The threshold concentration for BAX auto-activation is identified in green as the lowest concentration that exhibits a decrease in Polarization i.e., BAKTAMRA displacement. Higher concentrations result in faster kinetics of BAKTAMRA displacement (yellow through red data). Data are reproduced from Gelles et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5].\n(B) BAKTAMRA (50 nM) was added to BAX (60 nM) in the presence of BIMBH3 (BIM, 0.08–2.5 μM) and fluorescence polarization was measured. Gray line represents BAKTAMRA control. The BAX control (black data) is weakly auto-activating, resulting in a step-wise trend in displacement of BAKTAMRA as BAX is activated by BIMBH3.\n(C) Similar experiment as in (B). BAKTAMRA (50 nM) was added to BAX (40 nM) in the presence of BIMBH3 (BIM, 0.04–1.2 μM) and fluorescence polarization was measured. Gray line represents BAKTAMRA control. The non-activating concentration of BAX (black data) reveals that low concentrations of BIMBH3 result in stable binding to the BAK:BAKTAMRA heterodimer and an increase in Polarization (blue data). The threshold BIMBH3 concentration for activating BAX is identified in green and additional concentrations of BIMBH3 increase activation kinetics (yellow through red data).\n(D) FP assay in which BAKTAMRA (50 nM) was added to BAX (40 nM) in the presence of BIMBH3 (BIM, 0.04–1.2 μM) and BIF44 (250 μM). Binding of BIF44 to BAX reveals an increase in Polarization compared to the BAX control (dark gray compared to black data). The addition of BIMBH3 reveals a step-wise progression of BAX activation kinetics, demonstrating that the BAX+BIF44 condition was at the threshold concentration for activation.",
    "Pause point: Investigators should determine their ideal concentration of BAX and proceed to the next section with the same aliquots of reagents. The identified concentration may be used for future assays, but we strongly recommend repeating this step periodically or with each new batch of BAX for reproducibility and quality control purposes. It is not recommended to reuse these reagents for future experiments conducted on a different day.\nPerform a BAX activation assay using a BIMBH3 titration\nTiming: 70–80 min\nThe following steps describe the protocol for measuring and characterizing trends of BIMBH3-induced BAX activation. BIM is the predominant BCL-2 family protein responsible for activating BAX in cells, converging a myriad of stress and pro-apoptotic signal pathways onto BAX-mediated apoptosis (Sarosiek et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). BAX exhibits multiple conformers following activation by BIM and therefore investigators are likely to test their ligand of interest within the context of BIM-activated BAX (additional details regarding BIM triggering and the BAX activation continuum are discussed in Gelles et al., 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). We describe using a BIMBH3 peptide due to its commercial availability, stability, and potent activation of BAX; alternative BIM reagents (e.g., recombinant BIM protein, stapled BIM SAHB peptide) may be substituted but require more specialization to produce.\nKeep 0.5× PBS on ice.\nPrepare assay reagents.\nPrepare BAX.\nIn 0.5× PBS, prepare 450 μL of a BAX working stock that is 4× the non-activating concentration of BAX identified in the previous experiment and keep on ice.\nNote: For consistency, we strongly recommend using BAX protein from the freezer stock that was thawed and pooled for the previous experiment. Alternatively, investigators may thaw a fresh tube of BAX, however, slight changes in signal and optimal concentration may occur due to protein variability.",
    "Note: This volume is sufficient to aliquot 25 μL per well with 100 μL extra to account for human/pipetting error.\nPrepare BAKTAMRA.\nFrom the 1 μM BAKTAMRA master stock prepared in step 2b (or prepared fresh), prepare 700 μL of a 200 nM (4×) working stock of BAKTAMRA in 0.5× PBS. Keep on ice and protected from light.\nNote: The master stock may be stored at 4°C and used for 1–2 additional days if protected from light but may suffer a slight decrease in peptide quality (see problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section).

We recommend starting the range at 30–50-fold molar excess of BAX and diluting down.\nPrepare 120 μL of a 4× stock of BIMBH3 in 0.5× PBS. Aliquot 50 μL into duplicate wells in row A.\nAdd 25 μL of 0.5× PBS to all other titrant wells (rows B–F, see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, left panel).\nUsing a multi-channel pipette, serially dilute BIMBH3 in 25 μL from row A to F. Discard the final 25 μL from row F to obtain the correct final volume of 25 μL.\nNote: Mix well by pipetting up and down several times before continuing to the next row. Avoid generating bubbles.",
    "Note: This protocol describes a 6-point BIMBH3 titration (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, left panel). For a wider titration, this setup may be expanded to an 8-point titration with a third column used for controls (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, right panel). Similarly, the dilution factor may be adjusted to increase resolution of the BIMBH3 concentrations at the discretion of the investigator.\nUsing a multi-channel pipette, add 25 μL of 0.5× PBS to wells in rows A–F, 50 μL to row G, and 75 μL to row H.\nNote: Rows A–F will contain the BIMBH3 titration, row G will contain the BAX+BAKTAMRA control, and row H will contain the BAKTAMRA control (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, left panel).\nAliquot the 4× BAX stock in 7 wells of a PCR plate (or similar). Using a multi-channel pipet, add 25 μL of BAX to rows A–G. Each well will now contain 75 μL.\nCritical: Investigators should initiate the FP protocol prior to the addition of BAKTAMRA in the next step (see steps 12–15 of the before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section).\nUsing a multi-channel pipette, add 25 μL of BAKTAMRA column-wise to all wells. Immediately proceed to the next step.\nCritical: This step must be completed as quickly as possible to capture rapid binding kinetics. It is recommended to aliquot the BAKTAMRA working stock in 8 wells of a PCR plate (or similar) and use a multi-channel pipette to add BAKTAMRA column-by-column (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). We recommend aliquoting 87.5 μL of BAKTAMRA into the PCR plate to ensure sufficient excess and limit pipetting errors or delays.\nNote: The final concentration of BAKTAMRA is 50 nM.\nNote: The final volume in all wells is 100 μL.",

    "The following steps describe the protocol for setting up a 3-component assay to study the effect of a ligand (used at a constant concentration) on dose-dependent BIMBH3-induced activation of BAX (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). The ideal concentration of the ligand should be determined by performing a ligand titration experiment analogous to the steps in the preceding section. While we describe the single-dose ligand experiment below, the steps may be adapted for the reciprocal experiment using a single dose of BIMBH3 and a titration of the ligand of interest.
