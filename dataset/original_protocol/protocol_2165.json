Chromogenic detection of antibodies used to establish multiplex panel\nRepresentative images of optimized chromogenic detection for antibodies needed to establish multiplex panel. Chromogenic detection was followed by counter staining to visualize nuclei (Blue). Scale bar, 100 μm. (Images adapted from published work in (Allam et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1])).\nFix and section tissues.\nIncubate tissues in 4% Formaldehyde solution for 24 h.\nRinse tissue twice using 1× PBS, by immersing tissue in plastic container full with PBS, then discard PBS and refill container with fresh PBS.\nPut tissues in 70% Ethanol (EtOH) until embedding in paraffin blocks using standard protocols.\nDissect sections of 4 μm thickness and place on super-frost glass (Thermofisher) slide.\nDe-wax and rehydrate slides.\nDe-wax slides by placing in 200 mL xylene for 10 min, then transfer the slides into another container with 200 mL of xylene for 10 min.\nPlace slides into 200 mL of 100% EtOH for 5 min, then transfer slides into a container with 200 mL of 100% EtOH for 5 min.\nPlace slides in 200 mL 70% EtOH for 5 min.\nPlace slides back into distilled H20.\nAntigen Retrieval (AR). AR can be performed using one of the following methods:\nUsing pressure cooker (non-electrical):\nPre-heat your AR buffer of choice (Sodium Citrate pH6 or EDTA pH9) for 1–2 min until boiling point, then place slides in the buffer and pressure cooker.\nRemove your slides from pressure cooker and allow to cool down in AR buffer at approximately 20°C for 20–30 min, then wash twice using dH20.\nUsing water bath:",
    "Pre-heat your AR buffer of choice (Sodium Citrate pH6 or EDTA pH9) for 1–2 min until boiling point.\nMake sure water bath is at 90°C before placing your slides inside it.\nLeave slides in a closed water bath for 20 min.\nRemove your slides from water bath and allow to cool down in AR buffer at approximately 20°C for 20–30 min, then wash twice using dH20.\nNote: From this stage onwards avoid allowing slides to dry at any step throughout the protocol.\nNote: There are pros and cons for different AR buffers, for example EDTA pH9 AR buffer, offer better detection of antibodies, however, it can damage tissues. In addition, if the antibody signal to noise is strong using EDTA pH9 AR buffer can elevate background noise. On the other hand, Sodium Citrate pH6 AR buffer, is less efficient in antibody detection, however, it has minimal effect on tissue integrity. Hence, it is better to start optimizing antibody detection using Sodium Citrate pH6 AR buffer, if it does not provide a strong detection then try EDTA pH9 AR buffer.\nNote: A number commercially available pressure cookers are pre-programmed for AR can be used as well.\nBlocking endogenous peroxidases.\nIncubate slides for 20 min in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) buffer at approximately 20°C on a gentle rocker. Make sure the slides are in a dark container as H2O2 is light sensitive.\nWash slides twice with dH2O.\nNote: It is advisable to use 0.3% H2O2 as it can damage certain receptors such as CD receptors at higher concentrations (Kim et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), however, if there is strong background after scanning slides, then repeat with higher concentration of H2O2, up to 3%.",
    "Note: The step of blocking endogenous peroxidases can be performed after adding the primary antibody, this will ensure that your primary antibody detection is unaffected by the sensitivity to H2O2 of the protein of interest.\nBlocking endogenous non-specific binding with secondary antibodies.\nHave your slides in dH2O before drawing with Pap-pen (Abcam) and draw around tissue carefully.\nAdd 5% serum of the host your secondary antibody was raised in (enough to cover the entire tissue), for example, if your secondary antibody was raised in goat, then use 5% goat serum to block endogenous non-specific binding. Incubate your slides in a humidified dark chamber for 1 h at approximately 20°C on gentle rocker.\nPlace slide in TBST and incubate for 10 min at approximately 20°C with gentle rocking before moving to add primary antibody.\nNote: Avoid using Pap-pen on slides which were in TBST, as TBST sticks to glass slide and causes Pap-pen drawing to break, lift off and cover tissue, preventing their staining. If slides were in TBST wash thoroughly with dH2O before using Pap-pen.\nNote: If you do not have blocking serum of the host the secondary antibody raised in, 2%–5% BSA can be used, however, this should be tested.\nNote: Incubating slides in TBST allow better tissue permeabilization. In addition, TBST sticks to slides allowing primary antibody buffer to spread equally on the tissue without physically trying to spread it on tissue.\nAdding primary antibody.\nDilute primary antibody concentrations in 2% blocking serum in 1×TBS (1×TBS in dH2O).\nStart by using 4 different dilutions of the antibody of interest, 1:100, 1:500, 1:1000 and 1:2000 (antibody: buffer).\nIncubate tissues with primary antibody for 1 h at approximately 20°C or 18 h at 4°C with gentle rocking.\nWash 3× with TBST for 3 min while on a shaker.",
    "Note: If the signal of antibody is still strong at 1:2000 dilution, lower antibody concentrations can be tested and vice versa if the antibody signal at 1:100 dilution is weak.\nAdding secondary antibody.\nAdd immPRESS secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) on tissues and incubate for 1 h at approximately 20°C with gentle rocking.\nWash 3× with TBST for 3 min while on a shaker.\nChromogenic detection.\nAdd DAB (3,3′-Diaminobenzidine) chromogen on tissues and incubate for 2–10 min at approximately 20°C with gentle shaking.\nWash 2× in dH2O to stop the chromogenic reaction.\nNote: Incubation of tissue with DAB is time sensitive and variable from antibody to another, therefore, it is advisable to optimize for the best time by incubating for as short as 30 s up to 15 min. It is best to add DAB to one slide, then observe under a light microscope the development of brown stain. Once you identify the best signal to noise incubation period make a note of it, and stain the rest of your tissue with different antibody concentration using the same incubation with DAB.\nNuclear counterstain.\nIncubate tissues in Hemotoxylin Solution for 20–30 s.\nWash under running water for 3 min.\nIncubate tissues in Scott’s buffer for 20–30 s.\nWash under running water for 3 min.\nDehydrate and coverslip tissues.\n1 × 5 min wash in 70% alcohol.\n2 × 5 min washes in 100% EtOH.\n2 × 10 min washes in xylene.\nCoverslip your slides with mounting media of choice.\nMonoplex optimization and spectral library establishment\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section will list the major steps in optimizing antibodies for a monoplex (single antibody) staining and optimizing parameters to establish spectral library (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1749-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Monoplex detection of antibodies used in establishing multiplex panel",
    "Images acquired using Vectra imaging system, are representative of monoplex staining of antibodies used in establishing multiplex panel. Scale bar, 100 μm. (Images adapted from published work in (Allam et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1])).\nNote: Immunofluorescence detection using OPAL fluorophores is more sensitive than chromogenic detection, hence it will require further optimization. Chromogenic detection will provide insight into key optimization parameters for antibodies of interest, including concentration, blocking and antigen retrieval at low cost and less labor.\nMonoplex optimization steps:\nFixing and section tissues (As described in step 1).\nDe-wax and rehydrate slides (As described in step 2).\nAntigen Retrieval (AR) (As described in step 3).\nBlocking endogenous peroxidase. (As described in step 4).\nBlocking endogenous non-specific binding with secondary antibodies. (As described in step 5).\nAdding primary antibody.\nDilute primary antibody concentrations in 2% blocking serum and 1×TBS in dH2O.\nBased on previously identified optimal chromogenic detection for each antibody the monoplex optimization can be planned. For example, if optimal dilution of primary antibody is 1:500 in chromogenic detection, then 1:500 should be the lowest dilution used in monoplex optimization. For the rest of the dilutions use 2×, 3× and 4× of the lowest dilution (e.g., 1:1000, 1:1500 and 1:2000).\nIncubate tissues with primary antibody for 1 h at approximately 20°C or 18 h at 4°C with gentle rocking.\nWash 3× with TBST for 3 min while on a shaker.\nAdding secondary antibody. (As described in chromogenic detection optimization).\nOPAL fluorophore incubation.\nDilute OPAL fluorophore (Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA)) stock into 100 μm DMSO and pipette up and down ∼10 times then vortex for 20 s.\nPrepare OPAL fluorophore staining buffer (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for fluorophore dilutions).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1749_2.csv\nIncubate tissue with OPAL buffer (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for incubation times).\nWash 3× with TBST for 5 min while on a shaker.",
    "Wash 2× with dH2O for 2 min while on a shaker to remove any excess TBST.\nOptional: Incubate slides DAPI (1 drop of spectral DAPI in 1.5 mL TBST) for 2–3 min, then wash 2× for 2 min in dH2O.\nMount slides with anti-fading mounting media of choice and coverslip the slides.\nIncubate slides in dark chamber at approximately 20°C for 18 h.\nNote: For spectral extraction, staining is performed for the antibody of interest without DAPI. However, it is ideal to stain the nuclei with DAPI during optimization to help identify the optimal staining parameters before moving into staining the full multiplex panel.\nScanning and identifying optimal dilution and OPAL fluorophore (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1749_3.csv\nScan slides using Vectra 3 Automated Quantitative Pathology Imaging System (we will refer to as Vectra Machine).\nGet your tissue in focus then use the autoexposure function to adjust exposure.\nOptimal antibody dilution should have exposure between 60 ms and 120 ms.\nNote: Optimal antibody dilution can vary between different OPAL fluorophores. Therefore, when building a multiplex panel should optimize each antibody with different OPAL fluorophores. For example, CD4 detection can be optimized to be detected using OPAL 520, 570 and 650 fluorophores, this approach allows CD4 detection in different signal bands, which in turn allows more options when building a multiplex panel.\nHeat cycle optimization. When staining a full multiplex panel, it is required to AR at the end of each cycle to remove the previous primary and secondary antibody complex. Considering that heat can damage proteins and molecules of interest, identifying how many heat cycles markers of interest can sustain before getting damaged is crucial in designating the right order of staining different markers of a full multiplex panel. Optimize heat cycle for each antibody as following:\nFor AR Cycle 1:",
    "Perform the regular staining steps described above (from steps 3 to 8) with the optimal antibody dilution.\nScan stained slides.\nFor AR Cycle 2, 3, 4 and 5:\nPerform the regular staining step described above, however, add primary and secondary antibodies only in the AR cycle being tested (e.g., for AR cycle 4 add primary and secondary antibodies only after 4 AR cycles).\nRepeat the regular staining steps described above (from steps 3 to 8) with the optimal antibody dilution.\nScan stained slides.\nNote: Using multiple heat cycles can help identifying best possible staining order while performing a full multiplex panel staining. For example, if the protein can be detected after AR cycle 2, but not detectable after AR cycle 3, then this protein should be stained either first or second in the staining order of the full multiplex panel.\nNote: Multiple AR cycles can weaken the signal of the protein of interest. Therefore, proteins with low expression should be stained early in the multiplex panel and abundant proteins should be stained after, unless they can’t sustain AR cycles.\nSpectral library development.\nBased on the previous steps identify optimal staining settings based on antibody concentration and exposure for each OPAL fluorophore used to detect the protein of interest.\nUsing the Vectra machine take a snapshot of optimized parameters for each antibody.\nUsing the spectral library building function in inForm software, open the snapshot image taken using the Vectra machine and extract signal spectral range from this image (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1749-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Establishing multiplex spectral library\nThe image shows spectral extraction of CD4 antibody detected using OPAL 570 fluorophore.\nSave the extracted signal in the experiment folder.",
    "Note: Optimization of the antibodies should be done on the same tissue type used to stain a full multiplex panel. For example, if multiplex panel to be performed on colon cancer tissue, then the optimization should be done using colon cancer tissue, using normal colon tissue is acceptable as well.\nNote: It is preferable to build a spectral library for the same antibody in the same OPAL fluorophore but with different heat cycles. For example, if the antibody of interest in detectable at different AR cycles but the signal is weaker as heat cycles increase, a spectral library can be built for this antibody at each heat cycle. This will provide better signal to noise ratio when spectrally dissecting a different multiplex panels, which include the same antibody but stained after different AR cycles.\nMultiplex panel staining\nIn this section we will list the major steps and consideration when staining a full multiplex panel.\nAt this stage all antibodies should be optimized and the spectral library established. However, the following should be considered while combining all antibodies of interest in one panel.\nEndogenous levels of expression:\nSince multiple heat cycles can weaken detection signal and proteins with low expression levels usually have weaker signal than those with high expression levels. We recommend staining for proteins of interest with low expression before those with high expression levels.\nOPAL fluorophores:\nOPALs 520, 570, 620 and 650 fluorophore provide a strong signal to noise detection. Therefore, proteins with low expression should be stained in these channels.\nOPAL 690 has a narrow spectral range of detection. Therefore, we recommend for best possible results using antibodies which provide strong signal to noise detection should be stained in this OPAL fluorophore.",
    "OPAL 540 can be detected in the emission spectra of OPAL 520 and OPAL 570. Therefore, we recommend using the OPAL 540 only if a 7-color multiplex panel is being established. If using OPAL 540 is required for the panel we recommend, 1) it is best to use antibodies with the strongest signal to noise ratio, and 2) staining for proteins of interest which do not localize in the same region of those stained using OPAL 520 & OPAL 570. For example, if proteins of interest being detected using OPAL 520 & OPAL 570 are expressed on the cell surface, then OPAL 540 can be used to detect proteins expressed in the nucleus.\nColocalizing antibodies:\nAntibodies which are expected to stain the same type of cells, should be separated spectrally by assigning two OPAL fluorophores which do not have spectral emission overlap (e.g., OPAL 520 and OPAL 620).\nUsing multiplex panel to identify the immunological synapse formation in developing T cells in the thymus.\nFollowing the optimization steps described above we stained thymic sections using antibodies and parameters in a single multiplex panel as described in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1749_4.csv"
