    "1. Instrument Start-up\nSwitch on the differential scanning calorimeter and increase the pressure in the cells to suppress boiling of the samples as well as prevent the formation bubbles at elevated temperatures. This is typically achieved by supplying nitrogen into the system.\nDepending on the constituting material of the cell (e.g., tantalum, gold, platinum, etc.), adjust the pressure of the nitrogen gas supply according to the manufacturer's recommended pressure to avoid damaging the cell. For example, set the pressure of the nitrogen gas supply to 45 psi for the instrument used to develop this procedure, and pressure above 80 psi may damage the cell.\nEnsure that all the cleaning agent reservoirs are filled to the required volume. Cleaning agents required include detergent and water to wash and clean the cell respectively after each sample run.\nSet the temperature of the sample holding compartment to a suitable value, preferably 5 °C, to maintain the integrity of the sample prior to experiment.\n2. Sample Preparation\nDialyze the sample against the buffer that will be used as the reference for the experiment. Alternatively, elution buffer collected at the final step of protein purification (i.e. column elution) can be used.\nDetermine the concentration of the protein sample using the most suitable protein concentration determination method such as Kjedahl method 33 or Lowry method 34. For objective comparison of results, use the same method consistently within the same study. The required concentration range may vary depending on the model of the instrument. For the instrument used in this protocol, the preferable working range is 0.5 – 1 mg/mL.\nDegas the sample and reference buffer in vacuum to get rid of microbubbles that can cause volume inaccuracy. This step can be skipped for newer calorimeter models.",
    "Using a micropipette and sterile tips in a laminar flow biocontainment cabinet, load the samples and their respective buffer in pairs into 96 well plates compatible with the instrument. Fill the first two pairs of wells with buffer and the last two pairs with water for the buffer-buffer and the water scan respectively. Buffer-buffer scans verify the suitability of the instrument prior to sample measurement (i.e. assessment of instrumentation error) as well as establish a baseline; while water scans are run to clean the cells.\nCover the 96-well plate with a sealing film, and ensure that the wells are properly sealed before taking the plate out of the Biosafety Cabinet to avoid sample contamination.\nPlace the plate in the sample holding compartment in the proper orientation.\n3. Experimental Parameter Setup\nNote: Depending on the instrumentation, samples can be loaded into the cell either manually using a syringe, or automatically using an autosampler. In this case (i.e. an industrial setting), an autosampler is used to save time.\nUsing the acquisition software, enter the sample information in the order the plate was loaded as per section 2.4.  Enter concentrations if available, otherwise, enter concentration values into analysis software prior to data analysis (section 4.2).\nSelect the option that ensures cleaning of cells with detergent before every sample scan, which should be followed by multiple water rinse steps to ensure no detergent residue is left in the cells.\nSet the starting temperature of the experiment to 20 °C, but this can vary depending on prior knowledge of the sample. For known proteins, pre-determined starting temperature can be used, while a lower starting temperature can be applied for unknown samples.\nSet the final temperature of the experiment, e.g. 100 °C. The final temperature may vary depending on prior knowledge of the sample.",
    "Set the scan rate of the experiment, e.g. 60 °C/h, which is the typical scan rate. However, scan rate may vary depending on prior knowledge of the sample, e.g. 90 °C/h, or 120 °C/h. It is advisable to scan unknown samples at different scan rates to assess the kinetics of unfolding.\n Rescan samples to investigate the reversibility of the thermal unfolding. The unfolding of a protein is considered reversible if the enthalpy obtained for the second scan is at least 80% of the enthalpy value for the first scan.\nSet the post-experiment thermostat to 10 °C to preserve the integrity of the calorimeter's cells.\nVerify that the experiment setup parameters are correct before executing the experiment. If everything is in place, start the experiment.\n4. Data Analysis\nRetrieve raw data from the experiment and select one sample at a time for analysis. Subtract reference scan, i.e. buffer, from the sample scan.\n\tNOTE: Reference subtraction is carried out automatically by newer models of DSC instruments.\nEnter sample concentration value if it was omitted as per section 3.1.\nFit and subtract baseline from the acquired thermogram to account for differences in the heat capacities of the folded and unfolded states of the protein which is caused by the exposure of hydrophobic groups to water upon unfolding. Linear or cubic curve fitting can be applied depending on the shape of the DSC profile for the sample. For consistency, the same type of fitting has to be used during a study, e.g. real-time stability study. This step is required to process the curve for peak integration to obtain enthalpy of transition.",
    "Perform peak integration using non-linear least square fit. Based on product knowledge apply two-state or non-two-state model. Two-state model can be used for single cooperative thermal transitions, and for unknown proteins, apply non-two state model until further product knowledge is available. If applicable, adjust curve fitting using the iterative curve fitting function of the equipment's software until the Chi-square value remains constant.\nObtained results will show the values for midpoint of transition temperatures (Tm), calorimetric enthalpy (ΔH), and van’t Hoff enthalpy (ΔHVH) of the sample."
