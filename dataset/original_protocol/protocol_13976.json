    "All the subjects included in the protocol have been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Capital Medical University, Beijing, China12. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject at the beginning of the study.\n1. IgG isolation\nPrepare the chemicals including binding buffer (phosphate buffered saline, PBS): 1x PBS (pH = 7.4), neutralizing buffer: 10x PBS (pH = 6.6-6.8), eluent: 0.1 M formic acid (pH = 2.5), neutralizing solution for eluent: 1 M ammonium bicarbonate, stored buffer: 20% ethanol + 20 mM Tris + 0.1 M NaCl (pH = 7.4), cleaning solution for protein G: 0.1 M NaOH + 30% propan-2-ol.\n\tNOTE: The level of pH is critical in this protocol. The elution of IgG requires a very low pH, and there is a risk of the loss of sialic acids due to acid hydrolysis. Therefore, elution occurs within seconds, and the pH is quickly restored to neutrality, preserving the integrity of IgG and the sialic acids.\nPrepare the samples: thaw the frozen plasma sample then centrifuge at 80 x g for 10 min, and leave the protein G monolithic plate and the abovementioned chemicals for 30 min at room temperature (RT).\nTransfer a 100 µL sample (which can be used to detect 2x to prevent the first failure) into a 2 mL collection plate (here, a total of six standard samples, one control sample [ultra-pure water], and 89 plasma samples were designed for 96 well plates and randomly assigned to the plate).\nDilute the samples with 1x PBS by 1:7 (v/v).\nClean a 0.45 µm hydrophilic polypropylene (GHP) filter plate with 200 µL of ultra-pure water (repeat 2x).\nTransfer the diluted samples into the filter plate and filter the samples into the collection plate using a vacuum pump (control vacuum pressure at 266.6-399.9 Pa).",
    "Preparation of the protein G monolithic plates\n\t\nDiscard the storage buffer.\nClean the monolithic plates with 2 mL of ultra-pure water, 2 mL of 1x PBS, 1 mL of 0.1 M formic acid, 2 mL of 10x PBS, 2 mL of 1x PBS (sequentially), and remove flowing liquid using a vacuum pump.\nTransfer the filtered samples to the protein G monolithic plate for IgG binding and cleaning, then clean the monolithic plates with 2 mL of 1x PBS (repeat the cleaning 2x).\nElute IgG with 1 mL of 0.1 M formic acid and filter the samples into the collection plate by vacuum pump, then add 170 µL of 1 M ammonium bicarbonate into the collection plate.\nDetect IgG concentration using an absorption spectrophotometer (optimal wavelength = 280 nm).\n\t\nOpen the software and select the protein-CY3 mode.\nDraw 2 µL of ultra-pure water and load it into the screen, then click Blank in the software to clear the screen (repeat 1x).\nDraw 2 µL of ultra-pure water and load it into the screen, then click Sample in the software to detect the ultra-pure water.\nDraw 2 µL of IgG sample and load it into the screen, then click Sample in the software to detect the sample.\nDraw 2 µL of ultra-pure water and load it into the screen, then click Blank in the software to clear the screen.\nClose the software.\n\t\tNOTE: The formula for calculating IgG concentration is as follows:\n\t\tCIgG = absorbance x extinction coefficient (13.7) x 1,000 µg/mL\nPut the extracted IgG to dry in an oven at 60 °C and preserve the extracted IgG (300 µL extracted IgG for 4 h).\n\t\nRemove 300 µL of extracted IgG if the concentration is greater than 1,000 µg/mL.",
    "Remove 350 µL of extracted IgG if the concentration is between 500-1,000 µg/mL.\nRemove 400 µL of extracted IgG if the concentration is between 200-500 µg/mL.\nRemove 600 µL of extracted IgG if the concentration is smaller than 200 µg/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: The concentration of IgG should be preferably >200 µg/mL for subsequent detection. The average amount of IgG should be preferably >1,200 µg, which can be tested 2x in case the first test fails.\nCleaning the protein G monolithic plate for reuse\n\t\nWash the plate with 2 mL of ultra-pure water, 1 mL of 0.1 M NaOH (for removing precipitated proteins), 4 mL of ultra-pure water, and 4 mL of 1x PBS (sequentially), then remove flowing liquid using a vacuum pump.\nWash the plate with 2 mL of ultra-pure water, 2 mL of 30% propan-2-ol (for removing bound hydrophobic proteins), 2 mL of ultra-pure water, and 4 mL of 1x PBS (sequentially), then remove flowing liquid using a vacuum pump.\nWash the plate with 1 mL of buffer (20% ethanol + 20 Mm Tris + 0.1 M NaCl) and add 1 mL of buffer (20% ethanol + 20 Mm Tris + 0.1 M NaCl) to the plate, then leave the plate at 4 °C.\n2. Glycan release\nPrepare the dried IgG and store the chemicals including 1.33% SDS, 4% Igepal (store away from light), and 5x PBS at RT.\nPrepare PNGase F enzyme by diluting 250 U enzyme with 250 µL of ultra-pure water.\nDenaturation of IgG\n\t\nAdd 30 µL of 1.33% SDS and mix by vortexing, transfer the sample into a 65 °C oven for 10 min, then remove it from the oven and let rest for 15 min.\nAdd 10 µL of 4% Igepal and place it on the shaking incubator for 5 min.",
    "Removal and release of glycans\n\t\nAdd 20 µL of 5x PBS and 30-35 µL of 0.1 mol/L NaOH to regulate a pH of 8.0, and mix by vortexing. Add 4 µL of PNGase F enzyme and mix by vortexing. Then, incubate for 18-20 h in a 37 °C water bath.\nPut the released glycans to dry in an oven at 60 °C for 2.5-3.0 h.\nSave the released glycans at -80 °C until further measurement.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is critical. The key to glycan release is improving the activity of the PNGase F enzyme to maximize its efficiency.\n3. Glycan labeling and purification\nPrepare the 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB) labeling reagent with 0.70 mg of 2-AB, 10.50 µL of acetic acid, 6 mg of sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN), and 24.50 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (total volume = 35 µL).
