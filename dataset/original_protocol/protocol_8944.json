    "The procedures that follow have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of California, Riverside.\n1. Construction of Incubation Chamber and Slice Holder\nConstructing the incubation chamber: Construct the incubation chamber  from material that is nontoxic. Make sure that the chamber has controlled air circulation, holds a sufficient amount of ACSF for a slice holder to float, and is large enough so that the slice holder can float at one end of the chamber while the gas dispersion from oxygen lines occurs at the other end.  The drawer portion of a pipette storage container with its air-tight lid (Figure 1A) fits these criteria nicely.\n\t\nDrill a small hole on the side of the container approximately 1¼ in from the top and ¼ in from the side. Fit a piece of flexible tubing through the hole (Figure 1B). Be careful to drill low enough so that the tubing will not be compressed when the lid is closed, yet high enough so it is above the solution.\nApply silicone seam sealant (“aquarium seam sealer”) to create a water-tight seal between the oxygen line and the chamber.\nConnect the “outside” end of the tubing to a gas tank (95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide) using a male Luer fitting. For a custom fit, cut-to-fit a natural beveled 200 µl pipette tip (Figure 1C).\nConnect the “inside” end of the tubing to a one-to-six line plastic manifold. Cut-to-fit six 20 µl Eppendorf microloader pipette tips to each manifold inlet (Figure 1D). The fine opening of the microloaders is ideal for producing a steady stream of small bubbles.\nTo allow for ventilation, drill two tiny holes on the lid of the container (Figure 1E).\nConstructing the slice holder: The slice holder is made from a Floating Bubble Rack (Figure 1F).",
    "Remove the bottom “legs” of the bubble rack, and cut the top to approximately 1¾ in.\nGlue a piece of Nylon mesh material to the bottom of the round rack using cyanoacrylate glue (such as standard Krazy Glue) to create an eight-well slice holder (Figure 1G). Each well can fit a single mouse hippocampal slice.\nFit the slice holder at one end of the incubation chamber and the microloader-manifold apparatus at the other end. Allow the microloader tips to rest on the chamber floor (Figure 1H). This setup is designed to ensure sufficient oxygenation to both the top and the bottom of the acute hippocampal slices, and to avoid bubbles coming out directly below the slice holder in order to minimize slice agitation and prevent direct contact of bubbles with the hippocampal slices.\nRinse the incubation chambers and slice holders thoroughly with ddH2O after each experiment, and decontaminate with 70% EtOH weekly.  In the case of incubating slices in different solutions, multiple chambers/slice holders will be needed.\n2. Solutions and Drugs\nArtificial Cerebrospinal Fluid (ACSF): Prepare 4 L of standard ACSF in ddH2O using the following (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.5 CaCl2, 1.3 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26.0 NaHCO3, 15 glucose, and 0.1 Trolox. Measure the osmolarity of the solution using an osmometer; it should come to ~310 mOsm. ACSF compositions for experimental conditions are described below (see Protocol 3). Filter all solutions using a 0.22 µm bottle-top filter into autoclaved glass bottles. Solutions are stable in 4 °C for up to a month.",
    "Slicing Buffer: Prepare slices using a modified ACSF containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 3.8 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26.0 NaHCO3, 15 glucose, and 1.3 ascorbic acid. Measure the osmolarity of the solution using an osmometer; it should come to ~310 mOsm. Replacement of CaCl2 with MgCl2 in the slicing buffer improves slice health.\nSulforhodamine 101 (SR-101, 1 µM) is used to identify astrocytes in acute hippocampal slices. Make a 1 mM stock of SR-101 by diluting 60.67 mg SR-101 in 100 ml of a modified low calcium ACSF prepared as follows (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 6 MgCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 26.0 NaHCO3, 15 glucose, and 1.3 ascorbic acid. Verify that the osmolarity of the low calcium ACSF is ~310 mOsm. Dilute the 1 mM SR-101 stock 1,000 times in modified low Ca2+ ACSF for loading. Store the final SR-101 solution in 4 °C and protected from light until needed for the experiment.\n3. Manipulation of Long Term Neuronal Firing Rates in Acute Hippocampal Slices\nUse one of two incubation protocols in separate experiments to manipulate long-term neuronal firing rates:\nInhibit neuronal firing: Incubate in tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 µM): CAUTION: Handle TTX with care as it can be fatal if ingested in sufficient quantities. Gloves and goggles are recommended. TTX completely abolishes AP-driven neuronal firing in acute slices. Incubate slices in 3.5 mM K+ ACSF, plus 1 µM TTX in the experimental condition. In the control condition, incubate slices in 3.5 mM K+ ACSF without TTX. The comparison between the two conditions reveals the up-scaling effect in astrocytic Gq GPCR activity. 3.5 mM K+ ACSF serves as the control condition (as opposed to say, 2.5 mM K+) in order to maximize the effect of TTX treatment.\n-- OR --",
    "Increase neuronal firing above basal rates: Incubate in high potassium: Increasing extracellular K+ concentration depolarizes neurons and increases their basal firing rate. Incubation in 5.0 mM K+ ACSF significantly elevates neuronal action potential frequency compared to 2.5 mM K+ ACSF15. Incubate slices in 5.0 mM K+ ACSF for the experimental condition, and for the control condition, incubate slices in standard 2.5 mM K+ ACSF. The comparison between the two conditions reveals the down-scaling effect in astrocytic Gq GPCR activity.\n4. Acute Hippocampal Slice Preparation\nSetting up the warm recovery chamber:\n\t\nWarm the water bath to 35 °C, then place the prepared incubation chambers inside. Fill the water bath with water up to the height of the ACSF within the incubation chambers (Figure 1G).\nOxygenate the experimental and control ACSF with 95% O2, 5% CO2. The bubbles emitted from the microloader-manifold apparatus should be small and plentiful but also gentle; there should not be any visible movement of ACSF within the chamber.\nSetting up the ice-cold dissection chamber:\n\t\nTake two buckets of ice. Place a bottle of approximately 300 ml slicing buffer into one bucket of ice and keep it oxygenated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 for 20 min. Submerge a 100 mm Petri dish into the other ice bucket, just below the surface of ice. Ensure the side of the Petri dish is in direct contact with the ice. Pour some slicing buffer into the Petri dish and keep it oxygenated as well.\nChill the cutting edge of the single-edge razor blade by submerging it into the ice cold slicing buffer in the Petri dish for more than 1 min.\nVibratome setup:\n\t\nTurn on the vibratome and make sure the drainage is closed.",
    "Secure the cutting chamber in the vibratome and pack ice around the cutting chamber. Precool it to 0-4 °C.\nRemove factory greases from the double edge razor blade by soaking it into 70% EtOH for 5 min and then rinsing with ddH2O. Cut it into halves carefully (do not bend the blade) and mount one half blade onto the cutting block.\nRemoving the mouse brain:\n\t\nAnesthetize a twelve to eighteen-day-old C57BL/6J mouse in a small chamber preloaded with 0.5 ml isoflurane soaked into a Kimwipe or cotton ball. Gently pinch the animal’s toes to make sure there is no pain reflex.\nDecapitate the mouse using a pair of sharp scissors, then remove the scalp using small forceps. Use small bone scissors to cut the skull from the cerebellum to the olfactory bulbs along the longitudinal fissure. Remove the cranial flaps using the small forceps. Gently remove the brain with a spatula, and submerge it into the ice-cold oxygenated slicing buffer in the Petri dish.\nBisect the mouse brain with the chilled razor blade in the Petri dish to allow more surface area for cooling and oxygenation. Let the bisected hemispheres sit in the ice cold slicing buffer for 2-3 min. The brain should become completely cool and more solid.\nApply a thin layer of cyanoacrylate glue on the platform of the vibratome. Glue both hemispheres to the platform cut side-down and lateral sides up, with the olfactory bulb facing forward. Secure the platform in the cutting chamber, then fill the cutting chamber with ice cold, well-oxygenated slicing buffer.",
    "Continue oxygenating the cutting chamber while preparing 300 µm thick parasagittal slices using the vibratome. Cut the slices at a frequency of 85 Hz, a forward speed of 0.20 mm/sec, and an amplitude of 1.40 mm. NOTE: We have found that the single most important variable in preparing healthy acute hippocampal slices is the quality of the vibratome. Our laboratory uses the Leica VT 1200 S magnetic drive vibratome with vibrocheck to reduce “z” vibration.\nAfter slicing, dissect the hippocampus and the adjacent entorhinal cortex out of each parasagittal slice using sharp forceps. Perform this procedure in the ice-cold, well oxygenated slicing buffer in the cutting chamber of the vibratome. The sharpness of the forceps is very important to the slice health as it minimizes handling of the slices.\nMake a transfer pipette by breaking off the long tip of a glass Pasteur pipette and topping the broken part with a pipette bulb. This enables use of the large end of the pipette to transfer slices. Make sure to order pipettes without the cotton plug in the large end (see Materials table). As slices are prepared in nonsterile conditions, it is not necessary to autoclave the pipette prior to use, although a new pipette should be prepared and used for each experiment.\nTransfer each hippocampal slice to the incubation chambers in the 35 °C water bath, by dipping the transfer pipette into the ACSF inside each well of the slice holder and aspirating the slice. Minimize movement of the slice during this process. Direct transfer of the slices to the warm incubation bath results in better quality slices than “ramping” the temperature up gradually.",
    "Allow the hippocampal slices to recover in the warm water bath for a total of 45 min, broken down as follows: Incubate slices for 20 min in 1 µM SR-101 diluted in low calcium ACSF, then transfer them to the low calcium ACSF (without SR-101) for 10 min. Subsequently, transfer the slices to control or experimental ACSF for the remaining 15 min of the warm incubation.\nAfter the 45 min warm recovery, carefully move the incubation chambers from the 35 °C water bath to the bench top, and then allow the slices to continue to incubate at room temperature for a total incubation time of 3 hr before beginning the bolus-loading protocol (see below).\n5. Bolus Loading of Astrocytes with Ca2+ Indicator\nPreparing Ca2+ indicator bolus-loading dye:\n\t\nFor each vial of dye (50 µg), add 3.87 µl of fresh dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and vortex thoroughly. The freshness of the DMSO is important for good loading and therefore, crack open a fresh ampule each time.\nMix in 9 µl of 20% pluronic acid and vortex thoroughly. Mix the dye with 100 µl of the appropriate experimental or control ACSF and vortex well, for a final dye concentration of 10 µM.\nFilter the solution using a centrifuge filter tube. This step prevents the loading pipette from clogging during ejection of the dye.\nPrepare a pipette from a borosilicate glass capillary pulled to a resistance of approximately 1.3 MΩ when filled with dye solution.\nPlace a hippocampal slice into a recording chamber designed for use with the microscope and continuously perfuse with oxygenated ACSF of the same composition that it was incubated in (1.5 ml/min). Alternate between control and experimental conditions when selecting a hippocampal slice.",
    "Discard unhealthy looking hippocampal slices. The quality of slices will vary even within a given experiment. There are no set criteria for quantifying slice health; therefore, determination of slice health is subjective and based mostly on experience.\n\t\nGenerally speaking, keep slices that have a smooth appearing surface and a high percentage of healthy CA1 pyramidal cells (Figure 2A). CA1 pyramidal cells are particularly sensitive and vulnerable to CNS insults, so having a large percentage (≥75%) of healthy CA1 pyramidal neurons may be a useful criteria for accepting or rejecting a slice.\nDiscard slices that have approximately >25% dead neurons. Dead neurons have a fried egg-like appearance (Figure 2B). NOTE: We have observed that the angle of the cut plays a major role in whether neurons appear healthy or not. If neuronal dendrites are projecting upwards (out of the slice), then the neurons will be mostly dead. This is presumably because such a large proportion of the neuron volume is contained within the dendritic tree, that severing the dendrites is lethal to the cells. On the other hand, if the dendrites are projecting parallel to or at a downward angle from the slice surface, there will be a high percentage of healthy neurons. Sometimes, therefore, neurons will be mostly dead on one side of the slice and healthy looking on the other side.\nLocate a suitable field of s.r. astrocytes 40-70 μm below the slice surface based on size, morphology, and location using differential interference contrast (DIC) optics.",
    "Load the glass pipette with dye solution and lower it to the surface of the slice above this field using a standard patch-clamp microelectrode holder. With the pipette at the surface of the slice, apply back pressure to the pipette to begin ejecting dye. Ejection of dye will be visible under both DIC optics and an appropriate laser such as a 488 line for a green dye.\nSlowly lower the pipette to approximately 40 μm below the slice surface using a micromanipulator and allow the dye to eject for approximately 45-60 sec. Then, lower the pipette an additional 35 μm (75 μm below slice surface) and eject dye for approximately 45-60 sec. Slowly retract the pipette tip from the slice. Shorter injection time is likely to result in insufficient dye loading, whereas longer injection tends to increase background loading, which decreases signal-to-noise ratio of the recording.\nTo ensure that a large number of astrocytes take up the dye, it is usually helpful to inject a second dye bolus a short distance away. Raise the pipette back to the surface of the slice, make sure that the pipette is not clogged, then move the pipette approximately 80-100 μm away from the first injection site, along the stratum radiatum. Repeat bolus injection at this site.\nAllow 30-45 min before imaging for the astrocytes to take up the dye and for the background signal to diminish. Leave the slice in the perfusion chamber during this time. Make sure this incubation time is built into the total 4 hr treatment of the experiment. Obtain the next slice and repeat steps 5.2-5.8.\n6. Recording Spontaneous and Gq GPCR Agonist-evoked Astrocytic Ca2+ Activity in Hippocampal Slices\nSetting up the confocal microscope for imaging:",
    "Limiting slice exposure to laser light is of utmost importance, as high exposure can lead to dye bleaching and/or phototoxicity. Using higher optical magnification or an increased zoom setting increases light exposure to the imaged field. Therefore, set the default values for each laser to a high photomultiplier setting, 1x gain and 0.5% laser output power.\nApply a 1.5x zoom for better visualization of astrocyte processes.\nSet the field resolution to 512 x 512 pixels.\nSet the scan speed to the fastest possible, which is ~1.2 sec per scan using the one way scan mode.\nCollect emission spectra using bandpass filters of 503-548 nm for the 488 nm laser, and 624-724 nm for the 559 nm laser. These settings allow imaging of a field of ~5-8 astrocytes at a relatively rapid speed at a resolution sufficient to observe astrocyte cell bodies and main processes. Ideally, astrocytes in the field will be bright enough to be seen clearly, but without any pixel saturation.\nConfirm the identity of cells loaded with Ca2+ dye as astrocytes by visualizing the SR-101 colabeling using the 559 nm laser.\nRecording astrocyte Ca2+ activity:\n\t\nDraw boxes using the image acquisition software over regions of interest (ROIs) within the cell, in this case over astrocyte cell bodies. The boxes should not include background pixels, to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio possible. Draw one box over background as reference.\nSwitch the perfusion to experimental ACSF plus 1 µM TTX (Abcam) through the remainder of the experiment. This eliminates any possible neuronal AP-driven astrocyte calcium responses. Remaining increases in astrocytic Ca2+ concentration will then be due to quantal vesicular release, constitutive (basal) GPCR activity, or some combination of both mechanisms.",
    "Record fluorescence over time from all ROIs. Any increases in fluorescence over baseline indicate increases in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration16, and therefore GPCR activity in astrocytes10,17,18. To avoid any possible early scaling effects on astrocytic receptors by TTX, complete experiments within 40 min from the time when the 1 µM TTX perfusion began.\n\t\nAfter obtaining 10 min of baseline recording of spontaneous Ca2+ activity, apply an agonist of interest (such as DHPG) at sequentially increasing concentrations. Leave a minimum of 5 min between applications to reduce possible receptor desensitization.\nAt the end of the recording, apply a cocktail of agonists for other astrocytic Gq GPCRs as a positive control for intact astrocytic Gq GPCR signaling pathways. Components of the agonist cocktail will depend on the receptor of interest. 10 µM of each of the Gq GPCR agonists histamine, carbachol, and 2Na-ATP to stimulate histamine H1 receptors [H1R], muscarinic acetylcholine receptors [mAchR], and purinergic receptors [P2YR], respectively, is a commonly used agonist cocktail.\nPost-experiment image acquisition:\n\t\nAt the completion of the Ca2+ recording, take still images with the 488 nm and 559 nm lasers, for later confirmation of astrocyte identity and ROI placement. Laser power and HV settings may be altered freely at this point to obtain an optimal image for colocalization, as there is no longer a concern about laser light intensity affecting the data (Figure 2A).\nRepeat steps 6.1-6.3 for a total of approximately 8 slices and 40 astrocytes/group. Slices should come from a minimum of 3 different mice.\n7. Analysis of Astrocyte Ca2+ Activity\nDefining a Ca2+ elevation: Standardization in defining Ca2+ transients has not been firmly established within the scientific community. What follows is a typical protocol that maximizes sensitivity while limiting detection of false positive events out of baseline noise.",
    "Have another lab member assign each slice a numeric code in order to analyze them blindly. At the conclusion of analysis, decode each slice. \nAnalyze spontaneous and evoked astrocyte Ca2+ elevations offline using imaging analysis software. Redraw and/or adjust the size, shape and the location of the ROIs as desired.\nScore increases in fluorescence intensity over baseline as a Ca2+ elevation if the peak amplitude is greater than two standard deviations (S.D.) above the mean of 30 sec of average baseline fluorescence for at least two consecutive sample points. In particularly noisy recordings (low signal-to-noise), this criteria may need to be adjusted to 3 S.D. above the mean baseline fluorescence. Define the onset of each Ca2+ elevation as the last data point before the fluorescence intensity exceeds one standard deviation above the mean.\nDifferentiate between multipeak vs. successive single-peak events. Score an event as “multipeak” when the fluorescence intensity does not return to baseline (below average baseline value +2 SD) for ≤9 consecutive data points (10.8 sec) between peaks. Thus, single peak events will have 10 or more consecutive baseline data points in-between them.\nClassify events as “plateau”-type responses when fluorescence intensity maintains peak amplitude (±10% of peak value) for at least 3.6 sec.\nAnalyze the amplitude, frequency, and kinetics of spontaneous and agonist-evoked calcium transients.\n\t\nDefine peak amplitude of the Ca2+ elevation as the data point with the highest intensity value (in cases of “multipeak” responses use the first peak; see Figure 2B).\nCalculate rise time as the difference between the response onset and the time corresponding to the peak amplitude. NOTE: 0 to 100% rise time may need to be used in order to have a sufficient number of data points to obtain a time value; scan speed is an important variable here.",
    "Calculate latency as the time between the initiation of agonist perfusion to the response onset. Rise time may be a more useful measure in brain slices, as long wash-in times create a confound in calculating response latencies.\nDetermine if there are statistically significant differences between the two groups for each parameter using Student’s independent t-test. Use number of astrocytes as the ‘n’. Use Pearson’s chi-square test to compare the Ca2+ activity patterns between control and treatment groups. Use Fisher’s exact 2-tail test to compare percentages of specific Ca2+ activity patterns between control and treatment groups. Express differences as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001."
