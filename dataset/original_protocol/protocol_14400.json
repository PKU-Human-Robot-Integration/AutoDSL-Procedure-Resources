    "1. Preparation of Amino Acid Solutions\nPrepare and label two 50 mL conical centrifuge tubes for each amino acid (one each for both \"low\" and \"high\" concentrations).\nPrepare a large 2 L flask containing purified water (18.2 MΩ·cm at 25 °C).\nCalculate the amount of each amino acid (in grams) to reach the desired concentrations, and weigh the appropriate amount of amino acid into their respective 50 mL centrifuge tubes using a spatula.\n\tNOTE: For the \"High\" concentration of the two negatively charged amino acids, PBS is used instead of water. We could not increase their concentrations due to their low water solubility, and using PBS instead of water helps to maintain the low pH. Furthermore, the concentration calculations were obtained using a final volume of 40 mL for each amino acid solution. All amino acid concentrations are outlined in Table 3. Be sure to rinse the spatula in between amino acids to avoid contamination. We recommend a water rinse, followed by wiping with 70% ethanol.\nAdd 40 mL of purified water (or PBS) into each 50 mL tube using a serological pipette. Cap tubes and vortex or shake vigorously until dissolved. Water bath sonication (room temperature, 130 W, 40 kHz) can also be used to assist in the solubility process.\n\tNOTE: The following amino acid solutions are sensitive to light and should be covered with aluminum foil: tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine (which consist of aromatic ring-like structures) and cysteine (reactive -SH group).\n2. Preparation of SAP-AA Solutions\nPrepare 20 mL scintillation vials for the self-assembling peptides. For a given self-assembling peptide, prepare one vial per prepared amino acid solution (each combination will be made in a separate vial).",
    "Using a high-performance analytical balance (with a readability down to 0.1 mg or less), weigh approximately 1 ± 0.2 mg of peptide into the bottom of each vial. Cap after weighing and record the exact weight of the peptide on the cap.\nPipette the appropriate volume of amino acid solution (prepared in Section 1) into each vial containing peptide, in order to reach the desired concentration of self-assembling peptide (0.1 mg/mL for long peptides with a length of 16 amino acids, or 0.2 mg/mL for shorter peptides with a length of 8 amino acids).\nSonicate for 10 min in a water bath sonicator (130 W, 40 kHz) at room temperature, ensuring the solutions within vials are completely immersed in the water bath.\n3. Preparation of Drug-DMSO or Drug-Ethanol Stock Solutions\nCombine 1 mg of drug (in this case, curcumin) with 100% DMSO, and another 1 mg with 100% ethanol to create two stock solutions.\n\tNOTE: We added 200 µL of DMSO and 400 µL ethanol to make DMSO-curcumin and ethanol-curcumin stocks that were 5 mg/mL and 2.5 mg/mL, respectively, due to varying solubility in each solvent; however, it is important to note that the concentration of stock should be adjusted depending on the hydrophobic drug of interest. Factors such as drug solubility and effective biological concentration are important in determining this value. Also, keep in mind that the stock will be diluted 100-fold and 50-fold in DMSO and ethanol formulations, respectively, when combined with SAP-AA solutions (see Section 4). It may be preferred to prepare a larger volume of stock depending on the number of formulations required – in this case, more than 1 mg of drug would be used. The stock can be stored at -20 °C; thaw on ice and vortex before use.",
    "Vortex vials for 15 s to completely dissolve the drug.\n4. Preparation of Drug Formulations\nPrepare clear, 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for each formulation. Be sure to label tubes with the intended self-assembling peptide, amino acid (and concentration), and co-solvent.\nAdd 10 µL of Drug-DMSO stock, or 20 µL Drug-Ethanol stock to appropriate microcentrifuge tubes.\nAdd 990 µL of SAP-AA acid solutions to the appropriate labeled microcentrifuge tubes containing Drug-DMSO stock, and 980 µL to those containing Drug-Ethanol stock. This produces 1 mL drug formulations with 1% DMSO or 2% ethanol.\n\tNOTE: The final concentration of all curcumin formulations was 0.5 mg/mL according to the protocol. Again, this will vary when using other hydrophobic compounds and/or beginning with a different stock concentration (see step 3.1)\nVortex vigorously for 30 s and allow formulations to rest for 30 min.\n5. Solubility Testing\nAfter rest period, vortex vigorously once again for 30 s.\nCentrifuge the formulations at 14,220 x g for 1 min.\nAnalyze the bottom of the microcentrifuge tubes for precipitation (by visualization).\nSubscription Required.
