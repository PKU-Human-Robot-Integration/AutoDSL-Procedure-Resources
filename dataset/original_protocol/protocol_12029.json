    "All animal studies were approved by the University of Notre Dame Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Preparation of Zebrafish Specimen\nPlace one adult male and one adult female Tg(convertible protein) into a mating chamber per standard procedures13. In this manuscript, use Tg(sox10:eos) fish9 because of access but other transgenic lines with photoconvertible protein can be equally used. Set up more than one chamber in case fish do not lay. Allow the fish to remain in the chamber overnight.\nThe next morning, collect eggs in 100 mm Petri dishes. Allow eggs to mature to 24 h post-fertilization (hpf) before screening.\nIf animals above were heterozygotes for the transgene, screen 24 hpf dishes for Tg(sox10:eos)+ embryos with a 488 nm light source and GFP filter sets on a dissecting microscope. Isolate Tg(sox10:eos)+ embryos and allow to mature to 48 hpf.\nDechorionate embryos manually with a needle or tweezers.\nPrepare and microwave 5 mL of 0.8% low-melting point agarose solution.\n\t\nOnce agarose is cool to the touch, place 3-4 anesthetized Tg(sox10:eos)+48 hpf fish in the center of a 10 mm glass-coverslip bottom Petri dish.\nAdd enough agarose to cover the surface of the coverslip, approximately 1 mL. Use a probe needle to arrange fish on their sides. Allow agarose to solidify to ensure mounting of animals. It may be necessary to continually re-arrange the zebrafish until the agar solidifies14. Solidification takes approximately 2 min.\nAfter the agarose has solidified for 2 min, slowly add embryo medium containing 0.02% aminobenzoic acid ester (Tricaine) to dish until the bottom surface of the agar and dish is submerged. This should be approximately 3mL.\n2. Microscope Mounting and Pre-conversion Imaging",
    "Open confocal software and select the capture and focus windows [Figure 1]. Under the capture window, select the lab-specific conversion imaging setting under the capture setting drop down tab [Figure 1]. Here, the lab-specific setting is called \"Fish Imaging.\"\nPlace specimen on confocal scope and bring into focus using course and fine adjustment knobs.\nOpen the focus window and locate the desired region of interest (i.e. dorsal root ganglia).\nSelect the c488Â  laser under the Filter Set menu. Set the exposure to 300 ms, laser power to 5, and intensify to 75 [Figure 2].\nCheck the 3D box under the capture type section. In the 3D Capture section, select use current position and check range around current. In the same section, set the range to 35, the number of planes to 36, and the step size to 1. The range can be increased or decreased to accommodate for the depth of the imaging area. For the spinal cord a range value between 35-40 stacks typically is sufficient [Figure 5].\nSelect current location [Figure 5].\nClick start at the bottom of the capture window to acquire image.\n3. Single-cell Photoconversion\nOpen confocal software and select the capture and focus windows [Figure 1]. Under the capture window, select the lab-specific conversion imaging setting under the capture setting drop down tab [Figure 1]. Here, the lab-specific setting is called \"Fish ablate full chip.\"",
    "Select the c488 and c541 laser under the Filter Set menu. If not using the same microscope software, find the menu to select different lasers and select the 488 nm and 541 nm lasers. Set the exposures to 300 ms, laser power to 5, and intensify to 75 [Figure 2]. These laser settings are selected based on producing enough fluorescent signal without causing photobleaching or toxicity. If toxicity or photobleaching is visualized, reduce laser power or exposure.\nOpen the focus window and click on the photomanipulation tab in the focus window. Adjust laser parameters accordingly. Change the laser stack power to 2, and then click Go. Change the Raster block size to 1 and click Set. Change the Double-click size to 4. Change the laser line to v405 [Figure 3].\nOpen the advanced capture settings in the capture window. Select the photomanipulation tab and change the Double-click repetitions to 2. Click OK [Figure 4].\nSelect the XY tab in the focus window. Double check the laser parameters from step 2 in the photomanipulation tab [Figure 3, Figure 4]. Set laser settings to photoconvert the cell of interest without photoconversion of surrounding cells.\n\t\nIf photoconversion of adjacent cells is present, reduce laser power. If photoconversion of cells does not occur, laser powers can be increased. Optimally, set laser power to photoconvert only the region of interest and not surrounding areas.\nCheck the timelapse box under capture type. Then, click Start [Figure 6A].\nOnce the live timelapse window opens, select the circle tool on the top toolbar [Figure 7]\nDraw a circle in the centermost region of the cell. Right click the drawn circle, select FRAP region, and wait 3 seconds. The selected area should become dimmer [Figure 8]. Click stop capture.",
    "If imaging more than one animal, go back to the XY tab in the focus menu and select position 2. Then, repeat steps 4.1-4.6.\nTo convert a population of cells, follow the protocol and laser parameters for steps 4.1-4.4 except instead of drawing a circle to FRAP the region of interest, use the line tool. Draw a line on the region of interest and FRAP the region using the same parameters listed above.\n4. Post-photoconversion Imaging\nOnce all points are photoconverted. Select the lab-specific standard image stack setting described in the precoversion imaging step 3. This is found under the capture setting drop down tab in the capture window [Figure 5].\nSelect the c488 laser and set the exposure to 300ms, laser power to 5, and intensify to 75 [Figure 2].\nSelect the c541 laser found under the same menu as the c488 laser. Set the exposure to 500 ms, laser power to 10, and intensify to 75 [Figure 9].\nCheck the 3D box under the capture type section. In the 3D Capture section, select use current position and check range around current. In the same section, set the range to 35, the number of planes to 36, and the step size to 1. The range number may increase or decrease to accommodate the desired imaging depth [Figure 5].\nIf there are multiple points in the XY focus tab, select the multipoint list option in the capture window. If not, select current location.\nClick start at the bottom of the capture window to acquire image.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
