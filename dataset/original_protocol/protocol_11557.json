    "Ethics Statement: The handling of the mice and the experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with European, national, and institutional guidelines for animal care.\nNOTE: The protocol includes five days of interventions (Monday to Friday), with breaks on the weekends (Saturday and Sunday). The protocol can be easily adapted to meet specific needs.\n1. Determining a Reward Suitable as a Second Reinforcer\nNOTE: Use food rewards, such as vacuum-packed food or animal feed that meets food safety standards. For example, different kinds of nuts, chocolate, gummy bears, or dried fruits are suitable.\nInsert a small Petri dish with different food rewards (pieces of 0.5 cm3) into the home-cage (Figure 1).\nAfter 10 min, check for leftovers.\nIf all rewards are eaten after 10 min, shorten the time span until a preference can be estimated.\nOn days 4 and 5 (e.g., Thursday and Friday), add small amounts of the preferred (\"winner\") reward to the home-cage to establish an affectation of all mice in the cage to the reward.\nIf the mice are not habituated to mouse tunnels, add a tunnel to the cage (at least 2 days before beginning the training, e.g., over the weekend).\nRepeat steps 1.2 - 1.4 on 3 consecutive days (e.g., Monday to Wednesday).\n2. Clicker Training\nPreparations for each training session\n\tNOTE: Every time a mouse needs to be lifted up in this protocol, lift it in a calm and gentle manner. Put a hand under the mouse to lift it up. During the first few times, the mice might be agitated, but the habituation process will be finished after several days. If this step creates difficulties, it is useful to refer to the protocol for \"cupping on the open hand\"28.\n\t\nPrepare a cage with bedding material.",
    "Transfer the cage of the mouse being trained to a quiet place.\nPrepare the reward and have a timer and the clicker/target stick combination ready.\n\t\tNOTE: If the mice are habituated to handling and already have a relationship of trust with the experimenter, the mice can be fed by hand. Otherwise, attach the reward to a stick or forceps in such a way that the mice can keep a distance from the experimenter.\nRemove all objects from the home-cage, which now serves as the training area (e.g., mouse houses, nest-building material, etc.).\nTransfer the cage companions to a prepared cage.\nGeneral rules that apply for all training sessions\n\tNOTE: The following general rules apply for all sessions and will not be mentioned again throughout the protocol.\n\t\nTrain each mouse for 5 min. Alternate between 30-s training and 15-s break periods.\nLet the mouse gnaw on the reward no longer than a second. Then, take the stick (with the reward) out of the cage.\nExecute the following pattern of rewarding:\n\t\t1 - 10 performances of behavior: reward every time.\n\t\t11 - 21 performance of behavior: reward every second time.\n\t\tFrom 22 performance of behavior on: reward every third time.\nAfter 4 min of training, the next performance of the desired behavior is reinforced by a jackpot reward. Allow the mouse to gnaw at the food reward three times longer than before.\nTraining session Day 1: \"Linking the secondary reinforcer with the food reward\"\n\t\nSet the timer to 5 min, press start, and add the mouse tunnel to the home-cage.\n\t\tNOTE: Take advantage of the innate thigmotaxis of mice and place the tunnel next to a wall (Figure 2). For the first few sessions, this will enhance the probability of the mouse entering the tunnel.",
    "Wait until the mouse inspects the tunnel. As soon as the mouse enters the tunnel, click and present the reward at the end of the tunnel.\nLet the mouse feed on the reward while sitting in the tunnel.\nClick continuously for 15 s while the mouse is sitting in the tunnel.\nAs soon as the mouse leaves the tunnel, go back to step 3.2.\nTraining session Days 2 - 5: \"Running through a tunnel\"\n\t\nSet the timer to 5 min, press start, and add the mouse tunnel to the home-cage.\nAs soon as the mouse enters the tunnel, click and present the reward at the end of the tunnel.\nAs long as the mouse is in the tunnel, click and immediately present the reward in the same manner.\nRepeat this for the next 30 s, and then pause for 15 s to take the tunnel out of the cage.\nAdd the tunnel again and click immediately when the mouse reenters the tunnel.\nPresent the reward at the end of the tunnel.\nAllow the mouse to gnaw for up to 1 s.\nTake away the reward.\nAs soon as the mouse starts re-entering the tunnel by itself, present the reward in front of the end of the tunnel (Figure 3).\nTraining session week 2: \"Following a target stick\"\n\t\nSet the timer to 5 min, press start, and place the globe at the end of the target stick in the cage.\nAs soon as the mouse shows interest in the globe, click and present the reward next to the globe (Figures 4 and 5).\nReward the mouse only after it touches the globe with its nose.\nWhen the mouse has linked the performed action to the reward, change the position of the globe during the training session (Figure 6).",
    "Wait for the mouse to meet this last challenge.\nPlace the globe in the cage.\nShortly before the mouse touches the globe, slowly and carefully change the position of the globe by 1 cm.\nClick and reward if the mouse has crossed the distance and touches the globe.\nRepeat this procedure until the mouse follows reliably.\nSlowly extend the distance the mouse has to cross.\nTraining session week 3: \"Following the target stick to the experimenter's hand\"\n\t\nPlace one hand in the training cage while holding the clicker/target stick combination and the reward with the other hand.\nSet the timer to 5 min, press start, and place the globe at the end of the target stick next to the hand.\nAs soon as the mouse shows interest in the globe, click and present the reward next to the globe.\nAs soon as the mouse has met this challenge, move the globe several steps closer to the hand.\nPlace the globe on the palm of the hand. Click and reward while the mouse is sitting on the palm of the hand (Figure 7).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
