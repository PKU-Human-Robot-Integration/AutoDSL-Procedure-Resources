    "All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health and regulations of the University of Hong Kong, and the protocol was approved by the Committee on the Use of Live Animals in Teaching and Research (CULTAR) at the University of Hong Kong.\nNOTE: Female farm pigs weighing 35-40 kg (9-12 months old) were used for this study. The flowchart of this experiment is shown in Figure 1.\n1. Surgical procedures\nAnesthesia and preparation of the animal\n\t\nFast the animals for 12 h and subject to water deprivation for 4 h before the experiment.\nAnesthetize the pigs through an intramuscular injection of tiletamine+zolezepam (2-7 mg/kg) and xylazine (0.5-1 mg/kg) prepared in 20 mL of normal saline. Monitor the animal's palpebral reflexes until they are absent.\nRemove the pig's hair and sterilize the skin at the neck and the groin for sections 1.3-1.5. Disinfect the operation area 3x with 70% ethanol and betadine.\nPlace a 7 mm endotracheal tube into the porcine trachea and place a 22 G venous indwelling needle into the ear vena.\nMove the pig onto the operating table and place in a supine position. Connect the endotracheal tube to the respirator and mechanically ventilate (inspiratory/expiratory time ratio 1:2) the animal with isoflurane (1.5%-2.0% inhalation) and oxygen (0.5-1.5 L/min inhalation).\nMonitor the surface electrocardiogram and blood pressure, and continuously monitor the heart rate, heart rhythm, and arterial blood pressure via electrophysiology recording systems.\nEchocardiography\n\t\nMove the pig to the left lateral decubitus position and fix on the table.",
    "Put the probe on the pericardial region and perform serial echocardiography, including 2D and M-mode imaging, using a high-resolution echocardiographic system and a 3-9 MHz transducer at the baseline, before cell transplantation and 8 weeks after cell transplantation (Supplemental Figure 1).\nAnalyze all the obtained images using commercial software. Calculate the LV end-diastolic dimension (LVEDD), LV end-systolic dimension (LVESD), LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), LV end-systolic volume (LVESV), LV ejection fraction (LVEF), and wall thickness after standard echocardiographic images are obtained from the parasternal long-axis view.\n\t\tNOTE: All the off-line analyses were conducted by another independent operator using a computer workstation. The variability of the measurements between different observers was 4% based on 20 repeated random images. All the echocardiographic measurements were performed in accordance with the American Society of Echocardiography recommendations.\nPacemaker implantation\n\t\nMove the pig to the supine position and fix the limbs of the pig on the table with straps.\nLocate the right carotid artery and jugular vein in the carotid triangle (behind the sternocleidomastoid and surrounded by the stylohyoid, the digastric muscle, and the omohyoid) and isolate the right carotid artery and jugular vein with hemostatic forceps under sterile conditions (Supplemental Figure 2). Ligate the distal end of the right carotid artery and jugular vein. Sew the two muscles with 2-0 Vicryl. \nCannulate the right jugular vein with an angiocath and insert a pacemaker lead to the right ventricle under X-ray guidance (Figure 2).\nIsolate the sternocleidomastoid and the anterior scalene muscle using forceps. Implant a pacemaker between the two muscles and sew the two muscles with 2-0 silk. Connect the pacemaker to the lead.\nReprogram the pacemaker to backup VVI mode (35 bpm) by a pacemaker generator after the transplantation.",
    "Apply rapid ventricular pacing (150 beats/min) to induce HF by a pacemaker generator 4 weeks after MI induction. Then set the pacemaker back to backup VVI mode at 8 weeks.\nInvasive pressure volume loop analysis\n\tNOTE: Perform invasive hemodynamic assessment at baseline, before cell transplantation and 8 weeks after cell transplantation to assess changes in LV function.\n\t\nIsolate the right femoral artery and femoral vein in the femoral triangle (surrounded by the inguinal ligament, sartorius muscle, and adductor longus muscle) (Supplemental Figure 2).\nCannulate the right femoral artery with an angiocath and place a guidewire into the artery via the angiocath. Remove the angiocath and cannulate a 9F sheath into the artery under the guidance of the guidewire. Remove the guidewire.\nCannulate the right femoral vein with a 12F sheath as described in step 1.4.2. Insert a balloon catheter from the placed 12F sheath into the inferior vena cava (IVC) under X-ray guidance.\nCalibrate a 7 Fr pressure-volume (PV) catheter in isotonic saline with a PV signal processor.\nInsert the PV catheter into the LV apex from the placed 9F sheath under X-ray guidance. Suspend ventilation and measure the left ventricular maximal positive pressure derivative (+dP/dt), end-systolic pressure (ESP), and end-diastolic pressures (EDP) with the PV signal processor.\nMeasure the end systolic pressure-volume relationship (ESPVR) by the PV signal processor during the occlusion of the IVC.\nRestart ventilation when the procedure is finished.\nInduction of MI\n\t\nIntravenously administer amiodarone (5 mg/kg intravenously over 1 h) and lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg intravenous bolus) to the animal before induction of MI to prevent ventricular arrhythmias.\nCannulate the right carotid artery with an 8F sheath as mentioned in step 1.4.3.\nPerform the coronary angiography through a 6F JR4 over-the-wire guiding catheter via the placed sheath guided by standard C arm fluoroscopy equipment.",
    "Occlude the left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) distal to the first obtuse marginal branch with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) dilatation balloon catheter inflation under X-ray guidance (Figure 2).\nInject 1 mL of 700 µm sponge microspheres mixed with 3 mL of saline prepared in a 10 mL syringe through the balloon catheter to block the LCX, then deflate the balloon and perform an angiogram to confirm the occlusion.\nRepeat the injection procedure to achieve successful complete blockage.\nMonitor the animal heart rate and rhythm to detect cardiac arrhythmias. If ventricular fibrillation happened, use an external, biphasic defibrillator to reestablish a sinus rhythm using 150-300 J shocks.\nStem cell injection\n\t\nRandomly assign all the animals with notable impairment of heart function (LVEF < 40% at 8 weeks after induction of MI) to two different groups: one that will receive intramyocardial administration of 2 x 108 human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hiPSC-MSCs), and the other that will not receive hiPSC-MSCs.\nPrepare the hiPSC-MSCs in 2 mL of normal saline for intramyocardial transplantation. Before intramyocardial hiPSC-MSCs transplantation, repeat the anesthesia and animal preparation steps mentioned in section 1.1, this time sterilizing 10 cm around the apex beat area. Perform left thoracotomy at the 4-5 intercostal space with a retractor. Perform pericardiotomy to expose the infarcted lateral wall.\n\t\tNOTE: The length of the incision was 10-12 cm.\nUse 5-8 intramyocardial injections (~0.3 mL per injection) around the infarcted area to administer culture medium (Table of Materials) to one group of animals or 2 x 108 hiPSC-MSCs to the other group (Figure 3). Carefully avoid any damage to coronary arteries to reduce the risk of hemorrhage.\nClose the intercostal space with iron wire and close the muscle layer with 2-0 silk. Sew the subcutaneous tissue and skin with 2-0 vicryl.",
    "Intracardiac programmed electrical stimulation\n\t\nPerform programmed electrical stimulation using a programmable stimulator to assess the inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) after the cell transplantation therapy.\nInsert a 6F electrophysiological catheter into the right ventricular apex via the femoral vein before sacrificing all the animals.\nDisplay the intracardiac recordings with the surface electrocardiogram leads I, II, and III on the electrophysiological recording system at a speed of 200 mm/s. Deliver a 2 ms pulse width at 2x the diastolic threshold using a stimulator.\nDeliver a pacing train of eight stimuli (S1) at two drive cycle lengths (200 ms and 300 ms), followed by one (S2) or two (S2 and S3) premature extra stimuli.\nSequentially shorten the coupling intervals until a ventricular effective refractory period or arrhythmia is induced. Note the presence of inducible sustained VT (>10 s).\n2. Postoperative protocol\nPostoperative medicine\n\t\nPerform conventional pharmacological therapies for HF. In brief, orally administer metoprolol succinate (25 mg) and ramipril (2.5 mg) to all animals daily.\nIntramuscularly administer enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg) and buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg) to all animals daily for 1 week after surgery to prevent infection and relieve pain.\nTo minimize immunological rejection, orally administer a steroid (40 mg/day orally) and cyclosporine (200 mg/day orally) to all animals from 3 days prior to cell transplantation to 8 weeks after.\nInfarct size assessment\n\t\nEuthanize the animals by an overdose of dorminal (pentobarbital sodium, 100 mg/kg, IV) at the end of the experiment.\nOpen the chest and collect the heart. Rinse the heart in 0.9% saline.\nSerially section LV tissue samples with a scalpel at 1 cm thicknesses in the LV transverse direction.\nSelect portions of the slices that contain the infarcted myocardium to measure the wall thickness and the infarct area.",
    "Capture the image of these slices and quantitatively analyze the wall thickness and the infarct area using commercial image analysis software.\nFix the tissue in 10% formalin at 4 °C for a month. Embed the tissue within, adjacent and remote to the infarct sites (~1 cm2 pieces) in paraffin. Section into 5 µm slices using a microtome for histological examination.\nCell survival\n\t\nDetect the engraftment of the transplanted cells by immunohistochemical staining with anti-human nuclear antigen (HNA) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer.\nCapture the image in three different sections at five random fields in each animal and quantitatively analyze the positive cells in the peri-infarct zone.\n\t\tNOTE: The image capturing system and image analysis software were used to capture and analyze the images of the heart sections.\nSubscription Required.
