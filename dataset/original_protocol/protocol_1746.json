    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis section lists the major steps and provides step-by-step details and timing for the generation of the GST-PFO probe. The protocol is divided into 4 stages: (Stage 1) Plasmid generation and production of recombinant fusion protein GST-PFO, (Stage 2) Pretreatment of frozen brain and liver samples for immunological staining, (Stage 3) Sectioning of the tissue and (Stage 4) Immunofluorescence colocalization with GST-PFO. Additionally, (Stage 1) is divided into 8 consecutive steps (1–8). The detailed protocol for the correct realization of the procedure is described below.\nStage 1: Plasmid generation and production of recombinant fusion protein GST-PFO\nTiming: 2–3 weeks, depending on the time required for plasmid generation step\nThis major step describes how the plasmid expressing GST-PFO protein was designed (based on the protocol described in Kwiatkowska et al. (2014)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) and the protocol followed for the production of the fusion protein. Upon completion of the following steps, a high-purity GST-PFO recombinant protein should be obtained.\nPlasmid generation\nTiming: 1–2 weeks depending on the shipping/delivering time\nObtain the DNA sequence of the PFO gene available at the NCBI database (NCBI: M36704).\nLeader sequence coding for 28 N-terminal amino acids should be deleted to enable the intracellular localization of the protein (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). In addition, modify the construct by introducing the sequence 5′ GAA AAC CTG TAT TTT CAG GGC 3′ encoding the ENLYFQG motif recognized by Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease (Kapust et al., 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) to allow potential removal of the GST tag if needed in further experiments.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1335-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Amino acid sequence corresponding to Perfringolysin O protein obtained in UniProtKB database (UniprotKB: P0C2E9)\nResidues highlighted in yellow correspond to the signaling peptide, which is 28 residues long.",
    "To obtain the recombinant PFO fused with a GST tag at the N-terminus, insert the construct into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (GenScript) using SmaI (5′ CCCGGG 3′) and EcoRI (5′ GAATTC 3′) restriction sites, after adding SmaI and EcoRI recognition sites to the construct.\nNote: In our case, the TEV-PFO construct (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) and pGEX-4T-1 vector expressing TEV-PFO were purchased from GenScript®.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1335-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Green: Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease recognition site.\nAlternatives: Alternatively, cloning experiments can be carried out in-house if preferred.\nTransform Escherichia coli (E. coli) BL21 (DE3) with the GST-PFO expressing pGEX 4T-1 vector. Cryopreserve the transformed bacteria in Lysogeny Broth (LB) medium and 15% (v/v) glycerol and store at −80 °C.\nProduction of recombinant fusion protein GST-PFO\nTiming: 5 days total\nTiming: 2 days for protein production: sterile procedure\nTiming: 4 h for bacteria lysis and GST-PFO purification: non-sterile process\nTiming: 6 h for GST-PFO purification: non-sterile process\nTiming: 1 day, 7 h for GST-PFO dialysis: non-sterile process\nProtein production: sterile procedure;\nMix the following reagents to pre-grow the transformed bacteria in a 100 mL flask:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1335_5.csv\nIncubate the flask at 220 rpm and 37°C overnight (12–24 h).\nMix the following reagents in a 1 L flask to grow the culture of transformed bacteria:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1335_6.csv\nCritical: Before adding the pre-grown bacteria, take 1mL of the LB medium and ampicillin mix sample in a spectrophotometer bucket and mark it as “blank”.\nTake a sample of the flask (once pre-grown bacteria have been added) in a spectrophotometer bucket and mark it as “St0”.\nIncubate the flask at 220 rpm and 37°C.",
    "Set up the spectrophotometer at 600 nm.\nAdjust the spectrophotometer to rest the blank and read the “St0” sample. Values are usually around 0.2 OD. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nTake aliquots (approximately every 30 min) and measure their absorbance until the values reach 0.6 OD.\nAdd 0.5 mM of IPTG to induce GST-PFO production.\nIncubate the flask 20 h at 220 rpm and 18°C. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nCentrifuge the culture in four 50 mL falcons at 1600 g over 15 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and keep the pellets at −80°C.\nTo continue with the lysis immediately freeze pellets at −80°C for a minimum of 30 min to help mechanical lysis.\nPause point: pellets can be stored over 6 months at −80°C.\nBacteria lysis and GST-PFO purification: non-sterile process;\nNote: Use all reagents previously cooled and perform all the processes on ice to avoid protein degradation (except when the requirement of room temperature is specifically stated).\nAdd 5 mL of “Lysis Solution” to each frozen pellet and mix it with a pasteur pipette without adding oxygen to the sample. Keep mixing until solid traces of the pellet disappear from the liquid part. Perform this step on ice.\nCritical: Degradation can occur if lysis is not performed on ice.\nDo not add oxygen to the sample to avoid oxidation processes.\nMix the four pellets in a 50 mL falcon and incubate them over 30 min at room temperature (20°C–22°C) in a rotatory shaker at 30 rpm.\nAdd the following reagents to the lysate.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1335_7.csv\nNote: The reagents added in this step are not part of the “Lysis solution”, even if they are also included in its composition.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 9000 g for 45 min at 4°C.\nCollect the supernatant, label it as “Total Protein Solution” and proceed with purification.",
    "GST-PFO purification: non-sterile process;\nNote: Use all reagents previously cooled and filtered with a 0.2 μm filter.\nGST-PFO purification was carried out by column affinity chromatography using prepacked Sepharose™ GST kit disposable columns and Glutathione Sepharose™ 4B medium (or resin), which shows high affinity to GST-tagged proteins, thus allowing rapid purification of the proteins applying gravity flow. For every 200 mL of initial induced culture, use 200 μL of the resin.\nEquilibrate the column by adding 1 mL of “Binding buffer” and following the manufacturer's instructions (https://es.vwr.com/store/product/10674189/disposable-columns-prepacked-sepharosetm-gst-bulk-kit[href=https://es.vwr.com/store/product/10674189/disposable-columns-prepacked-sepharosetm-gst-bulk-kit]). This will provide the optimal conditions to ensure that the target molecule, GST-PFO, interacts effectively with the ligand and is retained by the affinity medium as all other molecules wash through the column. Centrifuge at 500 g at 4°C for 5 min. Discard supernatant by careful pipetting. Repeat the process other two times to allow complete column equilibration.\nPipette 200 μL of the resin in an eppendorf. Add the “Total Protein Solution” sample and incubate it for 3 h at 4°C in a rotatory shaker at 30 rpm.\nMount the elution column following the manufacturer's instructions and prepare your work area to work with the gravity flow technique.\nAdd the “Total Protein Solution” sample to the column and collect the flow-through. Keep the flow through in an eppendorf or falcon on ice during the process. Label them as “Non-Bound”.\nWash the column with 3 mL of “Binding buffer” and collect the flow through. Collect and label as “Wash” and its respective numeration. Repeat the process 2 more times.\nElute with 500 μL of “Elution buffer” and incubate it for 10 min before letting it flow. Repeat 3 more times. Label as “Elution” and its corresponding number. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]",
    "Note: It is important to take into account that the GST-PFO yield depends on the recuperation of the protein from this step. The reduced glutathione concentrations described in this protocol were optimized to obtain the largest concentration of the recombinant protein without compromising its purity. You may decide which situation suits your assay better. After the last wash in the previous step, it is always recommended to do a first elution with a low GSH concentration as 20 mM to displace nonspecific proteins without losing the protein of interest. If your production is mostly uncontaminated you can start eluting with larger concentrations of GSH to recuperate more concentrated GST-PFO. In this assay, three elutions with 20 mM and two with 40 mM were done.\nTake aliquots of each sample for SDS-PAGE gels, needed volume: 15 μL.\nStore all samples at −20°C until use.\nPause point: samples can be stored over weeks. Nevertheless, it is strongly recommended to do dialysis before long storage times to avoid protein loss by degradation or crystallization.\nGST-PFO dialysis: non-sterile process;\nNote: Use all reagents previously cooled and filtered with a 0.2 μm filter. The process described here is for 200 mL of initial induced culture.\nRun an SDS-PAGE to analyze the collected samples from the purification step and decide which elution fractions dialyze together.\nSelect the eluted fractions with the purest and highest amounts of GST-PFO, pool them together in the same Amicon Ultra 15 mL centrifugal filters and dialyze them slowly with a “Dialysis Buffer”.\nCentrifuge the Amicon Ultra 15 mL centrifugal filters at 5000 g over 10 min. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]",
    "Calculate the concentration of glutathione per Amicon Ultra 15 mL centrifugal filter once eluted in the “Dialysis Buffer”. GSH concentration was determined by the “recycling method” based on the protocol previously described in Tietze (1969)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23].\nAlternatives: Alternatively, GSH levels can be determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The protocol we routinely follow in the lab is based on the one published by Fariss and Reed (1987)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8].\nRepeat elutions until the concentration of glutathione in protein samples is 0.01 mM or less.\nCritical: Glutathione can interfere in other assays if it is not washed off from samples.\nAliquot the concentrated protein with low glutathione concentration and store 10 μL apart for Nanodrop quantification. Add 20% (v/v) sucrose to the protein sample to prevent crystal formation.\nQuantify protein concentration with 1 μL of the stored solution. Correct the concentration given by the Nanodrop with the following formula:\nGST-PFO protein concentration (mg/mL) ÷ GST-PFO Extinction coefficient (E) = Corrected GST-PFO protein concentration\n∗Extinction coefficient (E) for GST-PFO = 1.384\nAdjust the concentration obtained by the formula to the volume of sucrose added per sample.\nAliquot the protein in adequate volumes for your assays. Label each sample with its corresponding concentration. Store samples at −80°C.\nCritical: Thaw samples only once.\nStage 2: Pretreatment of frozen brain and liver samples for immunological staining\nTiming: 5–8 days total\nTiming: 8 days for human samples\nTiming: 5 days for mouse samples\nThis step helps to preserve the tissue in optimal conditions and maintains cellular and subcellular structures intact for histological techniques. This protocol is a guide to the process.",
    "Pretreatment of frozen brain and liver samples for immunological staining; The pretreatment described here is for tissues that have been frozen at −80°C. The first part of the process consists in the perfusion of the sample. Afterwards, cryopreservation is done to keep the internal structures intact. Do all incubations at 4°C. Take into account that the reagents are the same for the processing of human and mouse samples, only incubation times will differ.\nHuman samples,\nImmerse the tissue sample in “Fixation Solution” for 48 h.\nCritical: PFA is toxic.

Once the methodology was established, the same protocol was applied to detect cholesterol in human and mouse liver tissue.\nCo-Immunofluorescence with GST-PFO; Apply all reagents in volumes of 200 μL for sections of human samples and 100 μL for sections of mouse samples. Incubate the samples in an orbital shaker at 10 rpm and 4°C.\nSurround the cut sections with a water-repellent pen.\nWash cut sections with PBS, 3 times, for 5 min to remove traces of PFA.\nApply NH4Cl-PBS (50 mM) over the cut sections and incubate for 40 min to quench fluorescence coming from PFA.\nWash with Triton X-100 1% over 30 min.",
