    "Restraint stress–induced anorexia Group house mice, 3–4 per cage and separated by sex; acclimate the mice to housing conditions for one week prior to beginning food intake measurements. During this period, mice should be handled daily by the investigator to acclimate the mice to handling-associated stress.To acclimate the mice to handling, pick up each mouse and scruff gently. Remove the water bottle and food for one hour prior to baseline feeding measurements (to control for the one-hour restraint period in which mice will not have access to food and water). Place mice in a clean cage immediately following the removal of the food and water so that mice do not have access to any food crumbs that may be on the bottom of the cage.Note: All feeding measurements should be performed at the same time of day in the same experimental location. After one hour of food and water removal, add a water bottle to the clean cage with fresh bedding and mouse enrichment (i.e., nestlet or wooden block) and between 20 and 30 g of food to the food hopper (mice eat approximately 3–5 g/day/mouse). Measure the body weight of the mice and amount of food immediately prior to adding the food and water to the cages.Measure the amount of food left in the food hopper 1, 2, 4, and 24 h after adding the food. Food intake per mouse is calculated at each time point by dividing the amount of food consumed by the number of mice in each cage.Measure the body weight of the mice 24 h after adding the food.Repeat steps A2–A4 for 3 to 5 days to establish baseline levels of food intake for each mouse prior to restraint stress.",
    "On restraint stress day (following baseline food intake measurements), grab the mouse by the tail and place each mouse in a 50 mL conical tube (see Figure 1) for sixty min, inserting the head of the animal first followed by the rest of its body, including the tail. For the control animals, only remove the food and water to give them a similar environment of food and water restriction as the restraint mice for sixty minutes.Notes:  Institutional animal care and use approval (IACUC) must be obtained to perform experimental work on mice. It is essential to monitor each mouse during the restraint period to ensure that mice are breathing adequately. To obtain the food intake of individual mice with and without restraint stress, the above procedure (steps 1–7) may also be performed on singly housed mice. However, mice should be single-caged for a minimum of one week prior to starting restraint stress–anorexia experiments in order to acclimate mice to single housing. Following sixty minutes of restraint, return the mice to the home cages with their littermates and add food and water as described in step A3.Measure food intake as described in step A4.Repeat steps A7–A9 for an additional 7–10 days to examine the effects of chronic restraint–stress on food intake and body weight.Social isolation–induced anorexia Group house mice with 3–4 per cage and acclimate the mice to housing conditions for one week prior to beginning food intake measurements. During this period, mice should be handled daily by the investigator to acclimate the mice to handling-associated stress.Change mice to a fresh cage, with fresh bedding and mouse enrichment. Measure the body weight of each mouse. Add 20–30 g of food to the cages and measure the amount of food added to each cage.",
    "Return to measure the amount of remaining food 1, 2, 4, and 24 h later. Calculate the amount of food consumed by each mouse by dividing the total amount of food consumed by the number of mice in the cage.Note: All feeding experiments should be performed at the same time of day in the same experimental location. Since mice are nocturnal and consume most of their food during the dark cycle, optimal results will be obtained by performing feeding experiments at the onset of the rodent’s dark cycle. Repeat step B2 for 3–5 consecutive days to establish a baseline measurement of food intake and body weight prior to social isolation.At the same time of day as steps B2-B3, single-cage each mouse, measure each mouse’s body weight, and add 10–15 g of food to each cage. Return to measure the amount of food in each cage 1, 2, 4, and 24 h later. For the control group, continue to calculate the amount of food consumed by each mouse by dividing the total amount of food consumed by the number of mice in the cage.Note: Mice consume food based on a circadian structure. Care must be made to perform all feeding measurements at the same time each day. Repeat step B4 for an additional 3–14 days."
