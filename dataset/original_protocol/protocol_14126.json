    "Animal breeding, handling and procedures were approved by the University of Virginia and the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Generation of SMC lineage tracing mice\nBreed Myh11-Cre/ERT2 males28 (Jackson Laboratory; #019079) with R26R-EYFP females (Jackson Laboratory; #006148) to obtain Myh11-Cre/ERT2+ R26R-EYFP+/+ males.\nBreed the Myh11-Cre/ERT2+ R26R-EYFP+/+ males with ApoE-/- female mice (Jackson laboratory; #002052). Cross the progeny and select by genotyping Myh11-Cre/ERT2+ R26R-EYFP+/+ ApoE-/- male and R26R-EYFP+/+ ApoE-/- female mice as final breeders. Clip tails and perform genotyping on littermates. All male mice should be Myh11-Cre/ERT2+ R26R-EYFP+/+ ApoE-/- and can be used as experimental mice (Figure 1A).\n\tNOTE: Genotyping protocols can be found on the Jackson Laboratory website. The Myh11 Cre/ERT2 transgene is located on the Y chromosome, precluding the use of females. Other lineage tracing systems can be used, but this system is to date the most reliable lineage tracing strategy to fate map SMC in atherosclerosis.\n2. Smooth muscle cell lineage-tracing mouse diet and treatments\nHave male Myh11-Cre/ERT2+ R26R-EYFP+/+ ApoE-/- mice receive a series of 1 mg tamoxifen injections from six to eight weeks of age to label permanently Myh11+ SMC with YFP and to track their fate (Figure 1A).\n\t\nHeat peanut oil at 55 °C.\nAdd tamoxifen in pre-heated peanut oil to prepare a solution at 10 mg/mL and incubate at 55 °C until complete dissolution of tamoxifen.\nPerform an intraperitoneal injection with 0.1 mL of 10 mg/mL tamoxifen solution for a series of ten injections over two weeks.\n\t\tNOTE: Tamoxifen is a biohazard and must be handled with care.",
    "Five to seven days after the last injection with tamoxifen, replace chow diet with high-fat diet (e.g., western diet; 42% kcal from fat; 0.2% total cholesterol) for a duration of 18 weeks to allow for the development of advanced atherosclerotic lesions, which consistently develops in multiple vascular beds including the aortic arch, aortic root, brachiocephalic artery and the abdominal aorta.\nAt 18 weeks of high-fat diet feeding, begin therapeutic intervention for the desired duration (Figure 1B).\n\tNOTE: As an example, we performed weekly intraperitoneal injections with an anti-IL1β antibody or an isotype-matched IgG control between 18 and 26 weeks of high fat diet.\nRemove food to fast mice for 8 to 16 h prior to tissue harvesting to perform accurate readings for plasma cholesterol and triglyceride.\n3. Harvesting of the Brachiocephalic Artery (BCA)\nAnimal euthanasia should follow Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) requirements and regulations. Euthanize the experimental mice by CO2 asphyxiation for approximatively 5 minutes and verify death by toe pinch.\nWeigh the mouse and collect blood.\n\t\nWeigh the mouse\nSpray the ventral side of the mouse with 70% Ethanol\nPerform cardiac puncture by inserting a 25G needle connected to a 1 mL syringe in the ventricle from the left side of the chest cavity. 0.1 to 1 mL of blood can be collected.\nTransfer the blood to an EDTA vacuum tube by flushing the syringe and place the tube on a rocker or rotator for 10-15 min.\nTransfer blood to a 1.5 mL tube and centrifuge for 10 minutes 250 x g at 4 °C. Carefully withdraw the top plasma phase with a pipette and adequate tips, and transfer to a new tube. Store at -20 °C prior to measuring cholesterol and triglycerides.",
    "NOTE: Whole blood can be used for additional studies including blood cell counts and other blood components including cytokines or immune cell profiling.\nMake an incision of approximatively 2 cm in the skin at the mid-abdomen using scissors and pull the skin to expose the abdominal cavity. Cut the peritoneum up to the sternum without damaging tissues. Make two cuts at the mid-axillary line through the thorax, being careful not to damage the heart and lungs.\nLift the sternum with tweezers and cut the diaphragm to partially expose the heart. If the heart is not easily accessible, cut away the ribcage enough to reach the right atrium.\nPerfuse the mouse with a gravity perfusion system (Figure 2A). Install the gravity perfusion system such that the pressure of the perfusion fluid is equivalent to the average murine blood pressure (Figure 2B). This system allows for consistency in perfusion and both maintains the vessel morphology and flushes red blood cells.\n\tNOTE: As reference, C57Bl6 mice have a physiologic blood pressure between 120 mmHg (average systolic blood pressure) and 70 mmHg (average diastolic blood pressure)29,30. Average systolic and diastolic blood pressure can vary with mouse genetic background.\n\t\nConnect a 23 or 25G butterfly needle to the gravity perfusion system and run Phosphate-buffered Saline (PBS) through the needle to expel the air from the tubes. Insert the needle into the left ventricle and secure the needle in place. Using iris scissors, make a small incision (< 2 mm) into the right atrium or the ascending aorta.\nPerfuse with 5 mL of PBS, then 10 mL of 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution, then 5 mL of PBS. Use both PBS and 4% PFA solution at ambient temperature.\nCollect the tissues of interest (e.g., liver, lung, spleen) and place them in the 4% PFA solution.",
    "Expose the BCA\n\t\nClean the neck area by removing the skin and salivary glands.\nPerform one cut down the midline of the sternum through the manubrium using scissors. Be careful that the scissors stay close to the back of the sternum to avoid damaging the vasculature located closely below the sternum. Pull both sides of the ribcage with forceps to fully open the chest cavity. Carotids should be partially visible.\nClean up by pulling muscles and connective tissue and removing fat with fine tweezers until the right carotid, the brachiocephalic artery the subclavian bifurcation and the aortic arch are cleaned and isolated of surrounding connective tissue and fat (Figure 2C).\nRemove the BCA\n\t\nUsing forceps, grab the right carotid below its bifurcation and make an initial cut above the forceps (Figure 2D).\nStill holding the carotid, make a second cut through the subclavian artery. The final two cuts are through the aortic arch, on either side of the brachiocephalic artery (Figure 2D).\nCollect other vascular tissues of interest (e.g., abdominal aorta, superior part of the heart containing the aortic root).\nPlace the BCA and other tissues in 4% PFA solution overnight at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: The fixation time should be kept consistent throughout the study.\n4. Tissue processing and sectioning\nRemove the tissue from 4% PFA and place in a labeled tissue cassette (Figure 3A). Use foam pads in the cassette to ensure the tissue retain its orientation and remains in the cassette through the processing step (Figure 3B). Close the cassettes and immerse in 70% ethanol until tissue processing (24 to 72h).",
    "Process BCA and other tissues collected for histological and immunofluorescent staining as follows (example of routine overnight procedure using a processor with vacuum penetration): 10% neutral buffered formalin for 30 min at ambient temperature (2x), 75% ethanol for 60 min at 30 °C (1x), 90% ethanol for 60 min at 30 °C (1x), 95% ethanol for 60 min at 30 °C (1x), 100% ethanol for 60 min at 30 °C (3x), xylene for 60 min at 30 °C (3x), and paraffin wax for 80 min at 62 °C (3x).\nEmbed BCA vertically, with the aortic arch closest to the block face (Figure 3C).\nCut through the paraffin block on a rotary microtome (10 µm thickness) until reaching the embedded tissue.\nOnce the tissue is visible, examine a section under a microscope to determine position. If the aortic arch is still visible, remove up to ten 10 µm sections at a time, examining a section at each interval.\nWhen the aortic arch has been sectioned through and the brachiocephalic artery is visible, adjust the orientation of the block to position the tissue completely perpendicular to the microtome blade.\nCut the BCA at a section thickness of 10 µm. At that point, all sections are collected serially with three sections per slide. Collect until reaching the subclavian bifurcation (Figure 3D).\n\tNOTE: It is important to cut the BCA at a section thickness of 10 µm for subsequent z-stack confocal image acquisition and single cell counting. This thickness will allow the rigorous and non-cofounding assessment of the association between a single nucleus and cytoplasmic or membrane staining though the depth of the cross section.\n5. Immunofluorescent staining",
    "NOTE: A complete characterization of atherosclerotic lesions includes assessment of morphological parameters and indices of plaque stability or instability and cellular composition that will not be the focus of the present protocol. Lesion morphology, collagen content, and intraplaque hemorrhage can be analyzed by Movat7,17, PicroSirius Red 7,31, Ter119 staining 7,18, respectively. Here, we will describe the protocol for analyzing the cellular composition of lesions.\nIncubate the slides in the following solutions at room temperature under a chemical hood: xylene for 5 min (2x), 100% ethanol for 5 min (2x), 95% ethanol for 5 min (2x), 70% ethanol for 5 min (2x), and deionized H2O (diH2O) for 5 min (2x).\nIncubate slides in antigen retrieval solution according to manufacturer's instruction.\n\t\nWith citric acid based antigen unmasking solution (see Table of Materials), dilute 3 mL of solution in 320 mL of diH2O. Place the slides in a staining reservoir and fill to the top with the prepared antigen retrieval solution.\nFill any empty slots in the slide rack with blank slides to ensure even heating. Cover the container with a lid to allow the antigen retrieval solution to boil without evaporation.\nHeat the slides in a microwave for 20 min at approximately 675-700 watts. Check the slides regularly and replace evaporated liquid with diH2O such that sections remain submerged in unmasking solution at all times.\nAllow slides to cool down in solution for 1 h at room temperature.\nDissolve 6 g of Fish Skin Gelatin (FSG) in 1 L of PBS. PBS/FSG is used as washing buffer. Prepare a blocking solution of 10% normal serum in PBS/FSG.",
    "NOTE: Fish Skin Gelatin is used in the preparation of the blocking buffer. FSG does not contain serum proteins that can cross-react with mammalian antibodies, minimizing background noise. However, other blocking option should be preferred with biotin detection systems as FSG contains endogenous biotin. The type of normal serum used is based on the secondary antibody used. When donkey secondary antibodies are used, normal horse serum should be selected for blocking and antibody dilutions.\nIncubate slides in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Circle tissue sections with a hydrophobic pen. Cover the sections with the blocking buffer PBS/FSG/normal serum for 1 h at room temperature. Prepare the primary antibody solution in PBS/FSG/normal serum during this step while the tissues are blocking.\nIncubate with primary antibodies diluted in PBS/FSG/normal serum overnight at 4 °C in a humidity chamber. One section per slide should be incubated with a mix of IgG control antibodies at the same concentration as the primary antibodies to control for primary antibody specificity.\nWash the slides as follows at room temperature: PBS/FSG for 5 min (3x), then PBS for 5 min (1x).\nIncubate with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (see Table of Materials) and diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for nucleus counterstaining diluted in PBS/FSG/normal serum for 1 h at room temperature. Protect slides from light.\nWash slides as described in step 5.6.\nMount slides using mounting media suitable for fluorescence (see Table of Materials).\n6. Confocal microscopy\nNOTE: The use of a confocal microscope and z-stack acquisition is critical for single-cell counting.\nSet acquisition parameters to be used throughout the study: image resolution (1024x1024 or 2048x2048 pixels); Optical path and number of channels, which are a function of the combination of secondary antibodies selected; scanning speed (recommended scanning speed: 7-8); and differential interference contrast (DIC) channel.",
    "Using sections stained with the primary antibodies and IgG control, set the detector sensitivity, laser power, and offset for each individual channel. The IgG control is used to minimize the background signal.\nSet up the upper and lower positions for z-stack acquisition. Predetermine the thickness and number of stacks to acquire. These parameters should remain consistent throughout the study.\n\tNOTE: We recommend imaging 8 to 10 stacks of 1 µm thickness. Stay consistent in the number of stacks imaged throughout the study.\nImage tissue sections stained with primary antibodies and IgG control for all channels including DIC.\nLabel at least one image with a scale bar for image calibration during single cell counting.\n7. Single cell counting\nInstall and open ImageJ. If necessary, download Plugins in the section Download > Input/Output of the ImageJ website to open the image file generated depending of the format of the images generated by the confocal microscope.\nOpen the image file in ImageJ.\nCalibrate the image with a reference scale bar using the image generated in 6.6.\nDelineate the region of interest in which single cell counting will be performed using the DIC channel (Figure 4).\n\tNOTE: One region can be delineated at a time. Depending of the experimental questions, single cell counting can be performed in the entire lesion area (see 7.3.1) and/or in a sublocation of the lesion. For example, investigation of the fibrous cap area (see 7.3.2) is particularly relevant since its cellular composition is an important index of lesion propensity to rupture.\n\t\nDelineate the lesion area by following the lumen border (Figure 4A; white arrows) and the internal elastic lamina (Figure 4A; yellow arrows) visible on the DIC image.",
    "For analysis of the fibrous cap area, determine the border distant of 30 µm from the lumen and trace the border ( Figure 4B-D).\n\t\tNOTE: The fibrous cap area is classically defined as the region enriched in ACTA2+ cells and collagen underlaying the lumen (Figure 4B). The enrichment in ACTA2+ cell and collagen plays a critical role in lesion stability. Previous studies have determined that the ACTA2+ cell rich fibrous cap area averages a thickness of 30 µm from the lumen in SMC-lineage tracing ApoE-/- mice fed a high-fat diet for 18 to 26 weeks (Figure 4C). Thus, meticulous characterization of the effects of genetic manipulation or pharmacological treatment on the fibrous cap area cellular composition is remarkably relevant.\nOpen the Channels Tools panel (Image > Color > Channel Tools) and pseudo-color the different staining channels (Figure 5A; box 1).\nMerge the color channels (Image > Color > Merge Colors) (Figure 5A; box 2). All channels should be visible on the same image (Figure 5B). Turn on and off individual color channels using the Channel Tools panel (Figure 5A; box 1).\nSet up the counting tool.\n\t\nRight click on the Counting icon in the tool bar (Figure 5C; box 1) and select Multi-Point Tool.\nDouble click on the same icon to open the Point Tool panel (Figure 5C; box 2).\nSelect the type and size of the items used to count cells.\nCheck Show all.\nTurn on the DAPI channel only in the Channel Tools panel and select the Counter channel 0 (Figure 5C; box 3). Click on individual nuclei that will be tagged (e.g., yellow dots in Figure 5C-D). Scroll z-stacks to count all nuclei stained in the region of interest. The number of events is indicated below the counter channel in Point Tool panel (Figure 5C; box 4).",
    "Turn on another staining channel (e.g., eYFP staining). Select the Counter channel 1. Click cells in which there is a colocalization between DAPI and staining. For cytoplasmic staining, select cells for with staining surrounds the nucleus on the entire depth of the nucleus (check several z-stacks).\nRepeat by modifying the staining combinations and selecting new Counter channels to count the cell populations of interest. Every dot color represents a different cell population (Figure 5D). Results can be expressed as number of cells to total number of DAPI or number of cells to region area.\nSubscription Required.
