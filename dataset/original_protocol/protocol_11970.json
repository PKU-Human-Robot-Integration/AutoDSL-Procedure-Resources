    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Peking University.\n1. Pancreas Isolation\nFor E17.5 (embryonic day 17.5) embryos:\nEstimate embryonic day 0.5 based on the time point when the vaginal plug appears.\nSacrifice the pregnant mice by CO2 administration. Spray the abdominal fur with 70% alcohol.\nMake a V-shaped incision with scissors from the genital area extending to the ribs. This process will completely open the abdominal cavity.\nDissect the uterus out of the abdominal cavity and place it in a 10 cm dish containing cold PBS.\nDissect the embryos from the uterus with thin-tipped forceps under a stereomicroscope, removing other tissues, such as the placenta and umbilical cord. Place all embryos in a 10 cm dish containing cold PBS.\nTear open the embryos’ abdominal cavity and dig out the visceral tissue with elbow tweezers. Transfer the visceral tissue into a 6 cm black-bottom dish containing cold PBS.\nThe pancreas is located in the upper left part of the abdomen and attaches to the stomach, spleen and duodenum (yellow dotted line in Figure 2A)12. Detach the pancreases from the visceral tissue using forceps and pool the pancreatic tissue together into a 20 mL vial containing 5 mL of 0.5 mg/mL cold collagenase solution: 0.5 mg/mL collagenase P in isolation buffer (HBSS containing 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Glucose, pH 7.4).\nFor P0-P15 (postnatal day 0-15) mice:\nSacrifice and fix the mouse by adhering the limbs to a piece of benchtop protector with tape. Spray the abdominal fur with 70% alcohol.",
    "Completely open the abdominal cavity as described in step 1.1.3. Pull the bowel out and to the left side of the mouse. This procedure will expose the duodenal, gastric, and splenic lobes of the pancreas. Carefully dissect all lobes of the pancreas (Figure 2B)12 and pool the pancreatic tissue together into a 20 mL vial containing 5 mL of 0.5 mg/mL cold collagenase solution.\nFor P18-P60 (postnatal day 18-60) mice:\nPrepare the collagenase solution. Keep on ice until ready for use.\nSacrifice the mouse and open the abdominal cavity as mentioned above (step 1.1.2 and 1.1.3).\n\t\tNOTE: Do not hurt the liver, any wound to the liver will reduce the flow pressure into the bile duct and reduce the perfusion efficiency of the following step.\nRemove the xiphoid. Pull the bowel out and to the right side of the mouse, and push the left and right medial lobes of the liver to each side to expose the gallbladder (white arrow in Figure 2C) and the common bile duct.\nClamp the duodenum with a pair of small vessel clamps at the upper and lower position, flanking the site where the bile duct enters the duodenum (Figure 2D).\n\t\tNOTE: Do not clamp the gastric or splenic lobes of the pancreas. The collagenase solution will not flow into the gastric and splenic lobe of the pancreas in the next step if clamped.\nFill a syringe with 5 mL of 0.5 mg/mL cold collagenase solution and insert a 30 G needle into the gallbladder. Carefully and smoothly, manipulate the needle through the common bile duct.",
    "Perfuse the pancreas by injecting 1–5 mL of 0.5 mg/mL cold collagenase solution, depending on the size of the mouse. The injection should be slow and constant to prevent the needle from slipping out of the duct and to prevent the intestine from bursting under high liquid pressure. The injection is complete when the pancreas is fully expanded.\nDissect the pancreas (The yellow dotted line in Figure 2D) out of the abdominal cavity using forceps immediately after perfusion. Place the tissue in a 20 mL vial containing 5 mL of 0.5 mg/mL cold collagenase solution. If manipulating more than one mouse at a time, perfuse the mice one by one and pool the tissues into cold collagenase solution in a 20 mL vial until all mice have been dissected.\n2. Collagenase Digestion and Islet Isolation\nPlace the 20 mL vial containing the pancreatic tissue into a 37 °C water bath and incubate for 3 min to equilibrate the temperature.\nGently shake the tube for another 3 to 5 min. If the pancreatic tissue is fully inflated, it will gradually dissociate into small tissue pieces until it is finally dispersed uniformly. The digestion time varies depending on the pancreas size and the perfusion efficiency.\nFilter the digested product through a 0.25 mm nylon strainer into a new 50 mL centrifuge tube. Throughly wash the strainer using a 20 mL syringe containing ice-cold PBS.\nFor E17.5-P15 pancreases, skip to step 3.1.\nFor P18-P60 pancreases, centrifuge at 200 x g for 1 min and discard the supernatant. Re-suspend the tissue with cold PBS.",
    "Pour 5 mL of the tissue suspension into a 6 cm black-bottom dish. The pancreatic islets are small, compact, milky white structures and acinar tissue is loose and translucent white. Pick islets with a 200 μL pipette and transfer them into a 1.5 mL tube containing a small amount of cold PBS.\n3. Trypsin Digestion of Pancreatic Tissue or Islets\nCentrifuge the tube containing pancreatic tissue or islets at 200 x g for 1 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nRe-suspend the pellet with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA and incubate in a 37 °C water bath. After 4 min of incubation, gently and occasionally aspirate (pipette) for 1 min using 200 μL tips.\n\tNOTE: For E17.5-P3 pancreases, add 1 mL trypsin-EDTA. For P4-P15 pancreases, add 3 mL trypsin-EDTA. For 100-300 islets, add 1 mL trypsin-EDTA. Adjust the volume of trypsin-EDTA according to the amount of tissue.\nStop the digestion by adding 0.4x volume of cold fetal bovine serum (FBS) and mix by gentle vortex.\nCentrifuge at 250 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nRe-suspend the cells with 200 μL cold FACS buffer (HBSS containing 1% FBS, pH 7.4). Transfer cells to a 5 mL FACS tube.\nQuickly spin the FACS tube to allow the cell suspension to pass through the filter to remove undigested large tissue debris. The single cell suspension in the tube is now ready for FACS sorting.\n4. Single-cell Lysis\nPrepare cell lysis buffer.\n\tNOTE: Perform all experiments under a UV-sterilized hood with laminar flow. All tubes, plates and pipette tips should be RNase-/DNase-free. Decontaminate the hood and pipettes with RNase away solution before use.\n\t\nThaw the reagents on ice: dNTP (10 mM), oligo-dT primer (10 μM), and ERCC stock solution (1:20).",
    "Dilute the ERCC to 1:5 x 105 with nuclease-free water.\nCalculate the volume of cell lysis buffer needed. Add 0.1 μL of RNase inhibitor (40 U/μL), 1.9 μL of 0.2% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, 1 μL of dNTP, 1 μL of oligo-dT primer, and 0.05 μL of diluted ERCC to a final volume of 4.05 μL for each cell.\nAliquot the cell lysis buffer into 0.2 mL thin-wall 8-stripe PCR tubes or 96-well plates. Centrifuge the tubes or plates for 30 s at 4 °C.\n\t\tNote: Centrifuge 0.2 mL thin-wall 8-stripe PCR tubes at 7500 x g and 96-well plates at 800 x g in the following steps.\nSingle-cell picking and lysis.\nManually pick FACS sorted Ins1-RFP+ single cells in FACS buffer into 8-strip PCR tubes using a 30–40 µm capillary pipette, or directly sort Ins1-RFP+ single cells into 96-well plates. The volume containing a single cell is considered to be less than 0.3 μL.\n\t\tNote: Use forward scatter height (FSC-H) vs forward scatter area (FSC-A) gating strategy for doublet discrimination, FSC-H vs side scatter area (SSC-A) for debris and fluorescence gating for Ins1-RFP+ cell (Figure 3A-3C) sorting. For the picking method, sort the target cells into a 1.5 mL tube containing 300 μL FACS buffer. The appropriate final concentration is 5–10 cells/μL. Adjust the buffer volume accordingly. For the plate collection method, sort a single-cell into each well of a 96-well plate following the manual of instrument.7,13\nVortex the tubes or plates to lyse the cells and release the RNA. Centrifuge the tubes or plates for 30 s at 4 °C and immediately place them on ice.\n\t\tNote: The cells can be stored at -80 °C for one week.\n5. Single-cell cDNA Amplification\nReverse transcription (RT).\nThaw the RT reagents (Table 1) on ice.",
    "Incubate the samples at 72 °C for 3 min and immediately put the tubes or plates on ice for at least 1 min. Briefly centrifuge the tubes or plates for 30 s at 4 °C.\n\t\tNote: Use a thermal cycler with a 105 °C heated lid for all incubations.\nPrepare the RT mix for all reactions, as described in Table 1.\nDispense 5.7 μL of RT mix to each sample to bring the volume to a total of 10 μL. Gently vortex the mix and centrifuge for 30 s at 4 °C.\nPlace the samples into a thermal cycler and start the RT program as follows: 42 °C for 90 min, 10 cycles (50 °C for 2 min, 42 °C for 2 min), 70 °C for 15 min and hold at 4 °C.\nPCR pre-amplification.\nThaw the PCR reagents (Table 2) on ice.\nPrepare the PCR mix for all reactions, as described in Table 2.\nDispense 15 μL of PCR mix to each sample, which contains the first-strand reactions. Gently vortex the mix and centrifuge for 30 s at 4 °C.\nPlace the samples into a thermal cycler and start the following PCR program: 98 °C for 3 min, 18 cycles (98 °C for 20 s, 67 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 6 min), 72 °C for 5 min and hold at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The PCR product can be stored at 4 °C for less than one week or at -20 °C / -80 °C for up to 6 months.\nPCR purification.\nAdd 25 μL of re-suspended DNA purification beads (1x) to each sample from the previous step and mix well by vortex. Then, quickly spin the tube or plates at room temperature to collect the liquid but avoid the settlement of beads.",
    "NOTE: Equilibrate DNA purification beads to room temperature for 15 min and vortex thoroughly before use.\nIncubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nPlace the tube or plate on an appropriate magnetic stand until the solution is clear, then carefully remove and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 200 μL of freshly prepared 80% ethanol to wash the beads while in the magnetic stand, incubate for 30 s, then carefully remove and discard the ethanol solution.\n\t\tNOTE: The 80% (vol/vol) ethanol solution should be freshly prepared each time.\nRepeat step 5.3.4 for a total of two washes.\nCarefully remove and discard the remaining ethanol solution and air dry the beads while the tube or plate is on the magnetic stand.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid over-drying the beads to ensure the maximum elution efficiency.\nAdd 11 μL of nuclease-free water to elute the DNA target from the beads and mix well by vortex. Then, quickly spin the tube or plate and place it on a magnetic stand until the solution is clear. Transfer 10 μL of the sample to a new PCR tube.\n\t\tNote: If dimers exist after a single round of purification, based on cDNA size distribution detection, purify again to remove the dimers completely. The dimers can influence the cDNA yield calculation if allowed to remain in the sample.\nQuality check of cDNA.\nRandomly choose samples to detect the cDNA total yield using a fluorometer.\nEvaluate the marker gene expression levels by real-time PCR (qPCR) (Figure 4E). Remove 1 μL of the sample to dilute 40 times and perform qPCR using a 384-well plate. Prepare the qPCR mix as described in Table 3. Cycling conditions: 95 °C for 10 min, 45 cycles (95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 15 s, 72 °C for 15 s).",
    "Randomly choose samples to detect the size distribution using a parallel capillary electrophoresis instrument.\n6. cDNA Library Construction\nTagmentation reaction by the Tn5 transposase.\nDetect the cDNA total yield of qPCR-selected cells from step 5.4.2 using a fluorometer. Use 2 ng of cDNA as the starting material.\nThaw the tagmentation reaction reagents (Table 4) on ice.\nPrepare the tagmentation reaction in a 0.2 mL thin-wall 8-stripe PCR tube, as described in Table 4, and mix carefully by vortex. Then, quickly spin down the solution at room temperature.\nIncubate the samples at 55 °C for 10 min and hold at 4 °C.\nImmediately add 2 μL of 5x TS to each sample containing the tagmented DNA to stop the reaction. Mix carefully by vortex, and then quickly spin down the solution at room temperature.\nIncubate the mixture for 5 min at room temperature. The DNA should be processed for the final enrichment PCR immediately.\nAmplification of adapter-ligated fragments.\nThaw the PCR reagents (Table 5) on ice.\nPrepare the enrichment PCR mix, as described in Table 5, and mix carefully by vortex.

    "Note: The DNA yield is typically between 15–25 ng for each library. The fragments ranging from 250 bp to 450 bp will be observed. If dimers remain after purification, as confirmed by the size distribution check, purify with 1 x DNA purification beads one more time.\nLibrary pooling\nBased on the approximate fragment size, pool equal amounts of DNA from each sample, ensuring that none of them contain the same combinations of N6XX and N8XX adapters.\n7. DNA Sequencing\nSubject barcoded libraries to 51 bp single-end sequencing using a high-throughput sequencing system. Perform the sequencing following the manufacturer's protocol.
