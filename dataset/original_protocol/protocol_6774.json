    "We first design the primers for the multiplexed Primer ID library prep. After extraction of viral RNA from the tissue culture supernatants or total RNA from lung tissues, we construct MiSeq sequencing libraries using the multiplexed Primer ID library prep protocol from each specimen. The multiplexed Primer ID protocol allows us to make a sequencing library of multiple regions of the viral RNA in one reaction. We pool up to 24 barcoded libraries (from 24 different specimens) for each sequencing run. We use Illumina MiSeq V3 kit (600 cycle) for the sequencing. We choose paired-end sequencing to have longer read length and better error correction from overlapping regions over single-end sequencing.Primer ID cDNA primer and PCR primer designDesign primer sequences using NCBI Primer-BLAST.Use ORF1b region of the reference genome MERS-CoV NC_019843 as “PCR template” in the Primer-BLAST interface to design primers for MERS-CoV. Use mouse interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 (Ifit2, reference: NM_008332), interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 3 (Ifit3, reference: NM_010501), ISG15 ubiquitin-like modifier (Isg15, reference: NM_015783), interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (Ifit1, reference: NM_008331) and chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 10 (Cxcl10, reference: NM_021274) genomes as templates to design primers for mouse mRNA.Set PCR product size as Min: 400 bp and Max: 600 bp.Set Primer melting temperatures as Min: 52, Opt: 55, Max: 58.Select 3-4 pairs of primers for each template region.Use SuperScript III one-step RT-PCR system to test Primers with best amplification efficiency for each region.Use MERS-CoV viral RNA from tissue culture described above for MERS-CoV primer testing. Use extracted total mouse lung RNA as template for mouse mRNA primer testing. Make serial 1:10 titrations of the template RNA in DNase/RNase-free water as RT-PCR templates. Make dilutions up to 10-6.",

An example one-step RT-PCR gel image for the primer design. Three sets of primers targeting same MERS-CoV genome were tested. A serial dilution of MERS-CoV RNA up to 10-6 dilution was used to test the primers. The SSIII one-step PCR system was used for the amplification. PCR products were examined by gel electrophoresis with 1% agarose gel. Primer set 2 had the best amplification efficiency thus it was selected for downstream Primer ID primer design. NC, no-reaction control.Design the Primer ID cDNA primers and other primers for the MiSeq library prep.Design cDNA primers by attaching the Primer ID (a degenerate block of 11-base long sequence) and adaptor sequence to the reverse primers.Forward primer of the 1st round PCR is designed by joining a common sequence “GCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGNNNN” on the 5’ end with the forward primer sequencing designed at step a) on the 3’. The Ns in the joined primer sequences are random sequences to increase the sequencing quality.Reverse primer of the 1st round PCR is designed against the adaptor sequence section of the Primer ID cDNA primer, and is universal regardless of regions (Table 1).",
    "The 2nd round PCR primers are designed to incorporate the MiSeq sequencing adaptors with barcodes.Order primers designed above in Steps A1a-A1d from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT). Request hand-mixing of the precursors for the degenerate block of sequence of the cDNA primers to have an even distribution of bases at each position.Table 1 shows the complete list of primers used in this protocol including primers for Primer ID MiSeq library prep and customized MiSeq sequencing primer. Table 2 shows the sequences of the indexed primers.Notes: Primer-BLAST is not necessary to design primers. Primers can be manually designed based on known reference genomes. Hand-mixing of nucleotide precursors prior to Primer ID cDNA primer synthesis is important to ensure the degenerate sequences have an even distribution of bases (A, C, G, T) at each position of the degenerate block. Table 1. Primers used for MiSeq library prep and sequencing. Primer sequences with gene-specific regions are highlighted in blue. They can be replaced with other gene-specific primer sequences when designing primers for other viruses.table:",

Do not disturb the separated magnetic beads. Be sure to remove all of the ethanol from the bottom of the well as it may contain residual contaminants.Let the reaction tube air-dry up to 10 min on the rack with the cap open. The tube(s) should air-dry until the last visible traces of ethanol evaporate.

Vortex every 2-3 min to help dissolve.Check the color of the gel solution (should be yellow, otherwise add 10 µl 3 M sodium acetate of pH 5.0).Apply the sample to the MinElute column and centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min.Transfer the column to a new collection tube, discard the filtrate, add 500 µl buffer QG and centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min.Transfer the column to a new collection tube, discard the filtrate, add 0.75 ml buffer PE, incubate for 5 min at room temperature, centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min.Transfer the column to a new collection tube, discard the filtrate, centrifuge at maximum speed for additional 3 min.",
    "Put the column in a new 1.5 ml tube, add 10 µl buffer EB. Stand for 4 min, centrifuge at maximum speed for 2 min.Quantification, pooling and QA/QC.Quantify each gel-purified library using Qubit dsDNA BR Assay kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/Q32850]. Use 1 µl of the library for each quantification.Pool the quantified individual libraries in equal amounts. We suggest pooling a total number of 20-24 libraries, each with 100 to 150 ng DNA per library. Use the maximum available volume of libraries if the calculated volume exceeds the actual volume.Purify the pool of libraries with AMPure XP beads following the protocol above in the First Round PCR section. The volume of AMPure beads to use equals the volume of pooled libraries multiplied by 0.7.Quantify the purified pooled libraries using Qubit dsDNA BR Assay kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol.Run the pooled libraries with the Experion Automated Electrophoresis System with DNA 12k analysis kit following the manufacturer’s protocol[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/10006455.pdf]. An example of gel image of Experion is shown in Figure 4.Check the size of DNA peaks on the Experion gel image. Make sure there is no visible peak around 100 bp (primer dimer). If it is present, purify the pooled libraries with AMPure XP beads again and repeat the quantification and Experion electrophoresis.Calculate the average DNA size (bp) of the library pool based on the Experion molarity (nM) and Experion concentration (ng/µl) using the following equation. Do NOT use the Qubit concentration to calculate the average DNA size.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210302/20210302012221_8310.jpg Notes: It is important to set up the cDNA reaction in a separate room from where the PCR amplification takes place to avoid potential contamination from PCR products. Viral RNA in this protocol that have very little quantity may not be measurable.",
    "qRT-PCR is usually recommended to confirm the copy numbers of viral RNA before library prep. We recommend at least 1,000 copies of input viral RNA for each library prep. However, this protocol may still work with less than 1,000 copies of input viral RNA, with compromised sampling depth. Primer mix is only needed when multiplexed regions are sequenced. It is possible to use one set of cDNA/forward primers at 10 µM concentration when sequencing only one region. Multiplexed regions normally should not overlap as this may inhibit the efficiency of priming and/or amplification. Include one negative control and possibly one positive control for each batch of library prep. It is recommended to aliquot the RNAclean XP beads and the AMPure XP beads into 1 ml aliquots. It is very important to warm the beads at room temperature for 30 min before use. The ratio of the volume of beads to cDNA/DNA is 0.7. It is optimized to remove long Primer ID cDNA primers or PCR primers. We recommend a second round of cDNA purification for some clinical specimens, especially plasma samples, to remove inhibitors of the downstream amplification. After the cDNA is eluted in water (in this case, use 40 µl water), add 28 µl of new RNAclean XP beads and purify the cDNA for a second time. Residual beads in the cDNA or PCR products eluent won’t affect the downstream amplification. First and second round PCR amplifications use two different KAPA PCR kits. The enzyme and buffer tubes look similar. It is very important to use the right buffer with the right enzyme for PCR 1 and PCR 2. Save the first round PCR product in the 1.5 ml tube in -20 °C, in case it is needed to repeat PCR2.",
    "Make sure to excise the fragment of the right size during gel extraction. Occasionally larger fragments (1.5-3 kb) can be present on a gel, which should not be extracted. Library concentration normally should be at least 20 ng/µl. Discard libraries with concentration less than 10 ng/µl as they are less likely to have high quality sequences. Qubit 2.0 fluorometer has been discontinued. Qubit 4.0 fluorometer is available at the time this protocol is written. Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit is not recommended to quantify the libraries. The HS kits have an upper detection limit of 100 ng/µl. In some cases the library concentration can be higher than 100 ng/µl. The Bio-Rad Experion system is used in this protocol but it is close to obsolete. A better substitution is Agilent TapeStation System (Agilent, catalog number: G2991AA). The TapeStation system can directly measure the average DNA size of the library pool. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3938/bioprotoc-11-05-3938-g004.jpgFigure 4.

    "Allow the reagent cartridge to thaw in the room temperature water bath for approximately 60 min or until completely thawed.Remove the cartridge from the water bath and gently tap it on the bench to dislodge water from the base of the cartridge. Dry the base of the cartridge, if necessary.Invert the reagent cartridge ten times to mix the thawed reagents, and visually inspect that all positions are thawed.Visually inspect the reagent marked IMT (incorporation mix) to make sure that it is fully mixed and free of precipitates.Gently tap the cartridge on the bench to dislodge water from the base of the cartridge and reduce air bubbles in the reagents.Note: The MiSeq sipper tubes go to the bottom of each plate well to aspirate the reagents so it is important that there are no air bubbles stuck at the bottom of the reagent wells. Place the reagent cartridge on ice or set aside at 2 °C to 8 °C until you are ready to load the sample onto the reagent cartridge and set up the run.Prepare the libraries.Denature DNAPrepare a fresh dilution of 0.2 N NaOH on the day of sample loading. This is essential in order to completely denature samples for cluster generation on the MiSeq. Always start with a concentrated stock of NaOH that is 10 N or higher, or you may get a decrease in cluster density.Calculate the molarity of the pooled library based on the Qubit concentration and average DNA size, dilute the pooled library to 4 nM.Combine the following volumes of sample DNA and 0.2 N NaOH in a microcentrifuge tube:4 nM sample DNA (5 µl)0.2 N NaOH (5 µl)Vortex briefly to mix the sample solution, and then briefly centrifuge the sample solution.",

Old Nextera Primer sequence can be found in Table 1.In a new microcentrifuge tube, add 3.8 µl of 100 µM Old Nextera Primer, and place on ice.Use a separate, clean, and empty 1 ml pipette tip to pierce the foil seal over the reservoir position 12 on the reagent cartridge.Pipette approximately 500 μl of the Read 1 Primer Mix out of the cartridge using a 1 ml serological pipette.Add the Read 1 Primer Mix to the tube with the Old Nextera Primer.Vortex briefly to mix the primer solution, and then briefly centrifuge the solution.Pipette the entire primer solution back into position 12 on the reagent cartridge using a 1 ml pipette tip.Note: Do not pierce any other reagent positions, they will be pierced when the cartridge is loaded on the instrument. Proceed directly to the run setup steps using the MiSeq Control Software (MCS) interface.",
    "Index sequences required for MCS can be found in Table 2.Notes: In the Illumina Experiment Manager (the software where you create the sample sheet) there is an option to select “Custom Primer for Read 1”. Since we are spiking in the custom primer into position #12, we do NOT select that option. Double check the primer sequence is correct and it is diluted to 100 µM. It is important that the custom primer gets mixed well with the other primers in position #12. We recommend pipetting 3.8 µl of primer into a new Eppendorf tube. Then remove the contents of position #12 and add them to the Eppendorf tube. Vortex to mix well. Then pipette the entire contents back into position #12 of the reagent cartridge. Tap the cartridge to make sure the liquid falls to the bottom of the tube. Do NOT add Old Nextera Primer into Positions 18 to 20 (custom sequencing primers). It is very important that the stock solution of NaOH is 10 N or higher. Some people try to use either 5 N or 2 N stock. For some reason these lower concentration stocks don’t work as well for denaturation and the 0.2 N dilution has to be made on the day of loading samples on the MiSeq. The denatured 20 pM PhiX library can be stored up to three weeks if stored at -15 °C to -25 °C. After three weeks, cluster numbers tend to decrease."
