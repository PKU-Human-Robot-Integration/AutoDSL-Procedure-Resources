    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nFigure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] shows an overall schematic of the workflow.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/232-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Overall Schematic Workflow\nFor each stage (dotted box), steps are annotated.\nPreparing Xenopus Egg Extracts\nTiming: 2 h\nPrepare egg extracts from different frog species (X.l., X.b., and X.t.).\nExtract preparation is a time-sensitive process requiring constant vigilance. An experienced researcher can handle 5–6 batches of eggs at the same time. For scaling up, we suggest involving multiple lab members. We recommend preparing extracts in a temperature-controlled lab-space maintained between 18°C–20°C.\nCritical: For X.t. extract preparation, all glass and plastic-ware must be coated by swirling a 0.2% gelatin % (w/v) solution in the beakers. Discard gelatin solution from beakers after use.\nCollect laid eggs in a 0.8 or 1 L glass beaker (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and keep batches separate if possible.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/232-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Preparing Xenopus Egg Extract\n(A) Good-quality Xenopus laevis eggs.\n(B) Lysed and puffy eggs (in red squares).\n(C) Sorted eggs that have been washed with MMR Buffer.\n(D) After successful dejellying, eggs are densely packed.\n(E) Eggs transferred into a suitable centrifuge tube.\n(F) After a short low-speed spin eggs are tightly packed.\n(G) A subsequent high-speed spin is used to crush the eggs and fractionate them into different layers: layer I is enriched in lipids, layer II is critical as it contains all cytoplasmic proteins including tubulin and layer III contains a mixture of pigment granules, yolk, nuclei, and egg cortex.\n(H) With the help of a syringe and 18G needle, layer II is extracted.",
    "Note: For X.l., the frogs are kept in 1× MMR during egg laying. X.b. frogs on the other hand are kept in 0.5× MMR. X.t. frogs are kept in tank water, but eggs are collected in 1× MMR. Both laid and squeezed eggs from each species can be used for extract preparation.\nPour off any residual buffer/water and wash the eggs several times in 1× MMR (0.5× MMR for X.b.).\nWith the help of a Pasteur pipette remove lysed and puffy eggs (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nCritical: The quality of eggs is important and can impact the yield and quality of protein obtained. Sorting out puffy and lysed eggs (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) should thus be performed meticulously. Additionally, we suggest discarding any batch of eggs with more than 10% of total eggs lysed or activated.\nPour off the MMR and add Dejelly Buffer.\nGently swirl the beaker to ensure uniform dejellying. As the dejellying successfully progresses, the eggs become more densely packed.\nExchange the solution after 2.5 min and wash again with fresh Dejelly Buffer.\nUpon successful dejellying, the eggs pack tightly (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nCritical: Ensure that the dejellying step is no longer than 5–6 min (10 min for X.t. eggs). Excessive dejellying may damage the eggs and cause lysis.\nPour off as much Dejelly Buffer as possible while ensuring that the eggs are not exposed to air.\nAdd CSF-XB to the beaker and gently swirl the eggs. CSF-XB addition halts the dejellying reaction.\nCritical: Dejellied eggs are particularly sensitive to mechanical perturbations. Special care must thus be taken during the following steps.\nDecant the CSF-XB and wash 2–3 times with CSF-XB Buffer.\nExchange the CSF-XB for CSF-XB+ buffer (CSF-XB containing protease inhibitor) and gently swirl.",
    "Preload an ultracentrifuge tube with 1 mL of CSF-XB+ buffer and 10 μL of Cytochalasin D (10 mg/mL) (X.l. and X.b.). For X.t. eggs add 1 mL of CSF-XB+ and 5 μL of Cytochalasin D.\nCarefully load eggs into the tube with the help of a cut plastic Pasteur pipette.\nNote: Ensure that while transferring eggs into the tube they are not exposed to air and try to fill the tube all the way to the top (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). If eggs from different batches appear healthy up to this step, they can be mixed to ensure centrifuge tubes are filled completely. Full tubes provide better separation during the crushing spin.\nTransfer the ultracentrifuge tube into a polypropylene tube with the help of forceps. The polypropylene tube acts as an adaptor that fits most clinical centrifuges (Eppendorf, Sorvall, etc.).\nNote: Place a few drops of buffer into the polypropylene adaptor before transferring the tube containing eggs to ensure the tube does not stick to the adaptor after the spin.\nPacking spin: Transfer tubes to clinical centrifuge set to 18°C (X.l., X.b.) or 16°C (X.t.). Spin X.l. and X.b. eggs at 500 rpm for 30 s, followed by 2,000 rpm for 90 s. X.t. eggs are spun at 200 rpm for 30 s, followed by 800 rpm for 90 s.\nAfter this spin, eggs should appear tightly packed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nRemove any residual buffer on top of the eggs.\nCritical: It is important to remove any residual buffer from the top of the eggs. At this step it is okay to sacrifice some of the eggs by exposing them to air, as any residual buffer will dilute the extract.",
    "Crushing spin: Transfer the tubes into rubber adaptors. Spin at 11,000 rpm in a JS-13.1 swinging bucket rotor (19,000 × g) for 20 min.\nCritical: Centrifugation should start at room temperature or 18°C. For X.l. egg extracts, the centrifuge should cool down during the spin to reach 4°C. For X.b. and X.t. egg extracts, the temperature can stay at constant 16°C–18°C. Extracts are also temperature sensitive and the correct temperature must be maintained to ensure proper biochemical activity. The acceleration settings for the centrifuge are set to maximum. The deceleration step is set to slow and the brake is turned off.\nRemove the thin-wall tube with the fractionated eggs from the polypropylene adaptor.\nAfter the crushing spin, the eggs should separate into three distinct layers (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G). The top layer is enriched in lipids. The second golden layer is the cytoplasmic layer and contains all soluble cytoplasmic proteins. The final dark layer contains a mixture of pigment granules, yolk, and egg cortex.\nCritical: All equipment used to handle extracts should be kept at the appropriate temperature. For X.l. and X.b. extracts, syringes, needles, forceps, tubes, etc. should be kept on ice. For X.t. extracts, equipment can be kept between 16°C–20°C.\nWith the help of a syringe and 18G-needle, puncture the tube near the bottom of the cytoplasmic layer (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H), rotate the needle so that the opening faces up and and gently aspirate the cytoplasmic fraction.\nRemove the needle and gently expel the extract into an Eppendorf tube.",
    "Critical: For purification of tubulin, all extracts should be kept on ice. However, if you plan to assemble RanGTP-asters or spindles to test extract quality, you can keep aliquots of X.l. and X.b. egg extract on ice and X.t. egg extract at 16°C. Extract can be used for 6–8 h without significant loss of activity.\nAdd Cytochalasin D (1:1,000) and protease inhibitors (1:100) to the X.l. extract. To X.b. and X.t. extract, add Cytochalasin D (1:500) and protease inhibitors (1:200).\nGently mix the extract with the help of a cut pipette tip.\nOptional: Take a western blot sample of your extract for quality control (see tubulin post-translational modifications).\nCritical: We recommend proceeding to the tubulin purification step immediately. Extract should not be frozen at this point, as this will impact tubulin activity.\nTOG Affinity Purification of Tubulin from Xenopus Egg Extract\nTiming: 6 h from clearing extracts to frozen aliquots of purified tubulin\nPerform all following steps in a cold room or on ice. Pre-chill all buffers, containers, columns etc.\nNote: As a reference we will use a total of 4 mL egg extract and a 5 mL TOG column. Yields for the various purifications are shown in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\nDilute egg extract 1:1 with 1× BRB80 to a final volume of 8 mL.\nTake a 10 μL sample “lysate” for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nAdd 3 μL benzonase (25 U/μL) and DTT to 1 mM final concentration and mix carefully by slowly pipetting up and down with a cut pipette tip.\nSplit the diluted egg extract into two ice-cold polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tubes and adjust to equal weight by adding small drops of 1× BRB80.\nCentrifuge at 80,000 rpm (440,000 × g) in a pre-cooled MLA-80 rotor at 2°C for 30 min.",
    "Note: After the spin, the extract should be clear. If this is not the case, you can further clear the lysate by passing it through a 0.45 μm filter. In case a layer formed on top of the cleared extract, collect the lysate carefully with a syringe and a needle.\nTake a 10 μL sample of “HS spin” for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nDuring the spin, assemble the purification setup in the cold room.\nWash tubing with 20% ethanol.\nWash tubing with ultra-pure water.\nWash tubing with wash buffer.\nConnect the TOG column to the peristaltic pump and tubing and equilibrate the TOG column with 10 CV 1× BRB80 at a flow rate of 1 CV/min.\nCritical: Be careful not to introduce air bubbles into the TOG column when connecting the tubing, otherwise you compromise TOG activity. If you happen to have air bubbles in the tubing, disconnect the tubing from TOG column and pump wash buffer through the tubing until the air bubbles are out of the system, then reconnect to the TOG column carefully. Never let the TOG column run dry.\nCycle the cleared lysate through the TOG column at a flow rate of 0.5 CV/min for 20 min.\nTake a 10 μL sample of “flow-through” for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nWash with 2 CV wash buffer to clear out most of the extract from the TOG column.\nTake a 100 μL sample of “wash 1” for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nChange the flow rate to 1 CV/min and wash with 10 CV wash buffer.\nTake a 100 μL sample of “wash 2” for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nWash with 3 CV ATP wash buffer.\nTake a 100 μL sample of “ATP wash” for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nIncubate for 15 min.",
    "Wash with 3 CV ATP wash buffer.\nMeanwhile you can start equilibrating the PD-10 desalting columns 3× with ice-cold desalting buffer.\nNote: Each PD-10 column can hold 2.5 mL of eluted tubulin and 3.5 mL desalting buffer are used to elute it from the column. We usually calculate to have a maximum of 10 mL of pooled tubulin fractions, so we calibrate a total of 4 PD-10 columns.\nTake a 100 μL sample of “wash 4” for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nWash with 10 CV wash buffer.\nTake a 100 μL sample of “wash 5” for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nNote: At this step, there should not be any protein in your washes. You can check this wash for the presence of proteins either by Bradford assay or A280. If you detect protein, additionally wash with 4 CV wash buffer. Take a 100 μL sample of “wash 6” for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nDecrease flow rate to 0.25 CV/min and elute tubulin with 3 CV elution buffer into 15× 1 mL fractions.\nCheck each fraction for protein by using a Bradford assay or A280.\nPool the fractions with the highest protein concentration.\nCritical: Take care to limit exposure of the tubulin to high salt since this will compromise tubulin activity over time. Quickly desalt the pooled fractions into desalting buffer using the PD-10 columns.\nTake a 10 μL sample of “pooled peak elutions” for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nDesalt pooled fractions via the PD-10 columns using ice-cold desalting buffer.\nEquilibrate one 4 mL Amicon Ultra-4 concentration column with desalting buffer by spinning it 2× for 3 min at 4,000 rpm (3,220 × g) in a clinical centrifuge at 2°C.",
    "Critical: The concentration step is the most critical in our hands. In some cases, we have lost up to 30% protein during this step. To minimize loss, we recommend thoroughly equilibrating the concentration column with desalting buffer and avoiding long spinning periods (See also Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nConcentrate the tubulin to at least 20 μM using a 4 mL Amicon Ultra-4 concentration column by spinning in a clinical centrifuge at 4,000 rpm (3,220 × g) at 2°C.\nNote: A 4 mL Amicon Ultra-4 concentration column allows you to concentrate to a minimum volume of ∼500 μL. In case you want to concentrate further, we recommend switching to a smaller concentration column with a maximum capacity of 0.5 mL.\nTake a 2 μL sample of “desalted and concentrated” for SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis.\nOnce tubulin is concentrated to your desired concentration, measure the final protein concentration, flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C. We usually use PCR tubes and make 5 μL aliquots.\nNote: Per convention, tubulin concentration is given for the αβ-dimer (ε280= 115,000 M−1 cm−1 and MW= 110 kDa).\nClean the TOG column by washing with 5 CV 1× PBS at 1 CV/min.\nNote: Ideally the TOG column is cleaned directly after use. We usually clean it during the concentration step.\nLower the flow rate to 0.5 CV/min and wash with 10 CV 10× PBS.\nWash with 10 CV column storage buffer.\nCap column tightly without introducing air bubbles and store in a 50 mL Falcon tube at −20°C.\nProceed with SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis for quality control."
