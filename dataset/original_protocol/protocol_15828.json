    "All experiments were performed in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and exceeded the minimal requirements recommended by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources and the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International. All procedures were evaluated and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Washington (UW IACUC protocol #4167-01). Five healthy macaques (2 Macaca mulatta, 3 Macaca nemestrina; male. 4-11 years old) participated in this study. Sterile instruments and technique were used throughout all surgical procedures.\n1. Making a cannula (Figure 1A)\nPreparation of each part\n\t\nBlunt the tip of a hypodermic needle (30 G, 13 mm length) with a disk grinder.\nCut a stainless-steel tube (30 G, inside diameter = 0.16 mm, outside diameter = 0.31 mm) to a length tailored to the depth of the target brain area (25 mm is well suited to inject the dorsal surface of the cerebral cortex). With a disk grinder, bevel one end of the cut tube and smooth the other. Deburr the inside of the tube with a broach.\nCut the polytetrafluoroethylene (PFTE) tubing (inside diameter = 0.23 mm ± 0.02 mm, wall = 0.23 mm ± 0.02 mm, 1 mm corresponds to 42 nL ± 7 nL of fluid) to a length appropriate for the amount of vector solution to be loaded (1 µL of vector solution occupies 24 mm of tubing). Flare both ends of the PTFE tube by insertion of the blunted hypodermic needle.\nInsert the blunted hypodermic needle approximately 5 mm into one end of the PTFE tube. Insert the unbeveled end of the stainless-steel tube approximately 5 mm into the other end (Figure 1A).",
    "Perform pre-injection testing. Inject filtered water through the hypodermic needle hub of the cannula. Confirm that water exits the beveled stainless-steel tube from the tip and that water does not leak from either junction.\n2. Injection procedure for anesthetized animals\nSurgery preparation\n\t\nSterilize surgical instruments and supplies using the procedures in the Table of Materials.\nIf needed, take a head MRI for targeting deep brain structures (Figure 2A).\nImmediately before the surgery, sedate the animals with ketamine (10-15 mg/kg) and administer antibiotics (cefazolin) and analgesics (sustained-release buprenorphine and meloxicam) intramuscularly. Then, deliver propofol via intravenous (IV) catheter in the saphenous or cephalic veins.\nIntubate the animal and transition it to isoflurane gas. Confirm proper anesthetization by stable heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, relaxed skeletal muscles, and the absence of palpebral or withdrawal reflexes.\nShave the animal's head. Apply artificial tear ointment to the corneas to prevent drying.\nInjection area preparation\n\t\nPlace the animal's head in the stereotaxic frame. Apply surgical scrub solution to the shaved skin with gauze sponges, apply gentle pressure to release any debris, and rinse with isopropyl alcohol. Repeat this process three times. Cover the animal with a sterile fenestrated drape. Incise the skin and reflect the muscle. Place the manipulator on the stereotaxic arm, position it to aim at the target brain area, and mark the craniotomy position on the skull with a sterilized pen.\nRemove the stereotaxic manipulator and perform the craniotomy. Incise the dura if desired (e.g., to visualize sulcal landmarks). Return the manipulator to the stereotaxic arm.\nVector solution loading (Figure 1C)\n\t\nGently transfer the vector solution to a sterilized PCR tube with a P20 pipettor, avoiding bubbles.",
    "Attach a cannula, with the beveled tip facing down, to a vertically oriented stereotaxic holder. Connect a 1 mL Luer-lock syringe to the hypodermic needle hub of the cannula.\nSubmerge the beveled tip of the cannula into the vector solution.\n\t\tNOTE: The syringe should be attached already; attaching it at this point would introduce bubbles into the vector solution.\nLoad the solution into the cannula by applying gentle negative pressure with the 1 ml syringe. Visually track the meniscus between the solution and air.\nOnce the vector solution has been loaded, continue the gentle negative pressure until the solution reaches the needle hub. Remove the 1 mL syringe and inject the colored mineral oil into the hypodermic needle hub.\n\t\tNOTE: The oil should be injected slowly along the inside wall of the needle hub to form a clear-cut meniscus with the vector solution and to avoid air bubbles.\nAttach the hypodermic needle hub to one of the two open ports of a 3-way Luer-lock stopcock.\n\t\tNOTE: Attaching the hypodermic needle to the closed port will introduce unwanted air pressure behind the oil.\nClose the port connected to the hypodermic needle hub, fill a 1 mL syringe with air, and attach it to either of the other two ports. Finally, close the remaining port of the stopcock to connect the syringe to the cannula.\nSlowly push air into the cannula. Once the colored oil appears at the tip of the blunt needle in the PTFE tubing, check for air between the solution and the colored oil.\nIf air is present, apply negative pressure to the syringe to return the colored oil into the needle hub. Remove the bubble and apply positive pressure until a drop of vector solution is visible at the beveled cannula tip.",
    "Remove the 1 mL syringe to release unwanted air pressure behind the oil and close the stopcock to prevent the vector from exiting the cannula by gravity.\nTape a plastic ruler to the PTFE tubing to measure the movement of the meniscus during injection (Figure 1B,D,F).\nCannula insertion into the target brain area (Figure 1B)\n\t\nAffix the cannula to the stereotaxic manipulator.\nManually transfer the pump tubing (which terminates in a Luer-lock connector) from the non-sterile assistant to the surgeon. The surgeon should grasp the Luer-lock connector through the wall of a sterile sleeve, affix a second sterile stopcock to the connector, tape the sleeve tightly around it, and then drop the collar of the sleeve, allowing it to extend along the tube by gravity.\nConnect the stopcock attached to the cannula tubing to the stopcock attached to the air pump. Set the air pump to low pressure, turn it on, and increase the pressure until the oil advances through the cannula and a drop of vector solution is visible at the cannula tip.\nAdjust the plastic ruler position on the PTFE tubing to measure the movement of the meniscus during injection.\nDrive the cannula down with the stereotaxic manipulator and record the depth at which the tip reaches at the surface (dura or pia mater).\nDrive the cannula to the deepest site to be injected along the track. The surface will dimple. If injecting surface cortex, confirm visually that the cannula has penetrated the surface, with a surgical microscope or magnifying loupes if available.\nTo minimize mistargeting due to tissue compression, drive the cannula in slowly (1 mm/min), quickly (0.5 mm/s) with a 1-5 min wait at the bottom, or overshoot the deepest injection site by 500 µm and then retract.\nInjection",
    "Inject 0.5 µL of the vector solution with the electric air pump over 10-30 s. Confirm injection flow by tracking the meniscus between the colored oil and the vector solution in the PTFE tube.\nWait for 1 min and retract the cannula to the next injection site along the track.\nAfter the final injection, leave the cannula in place for 10 min to avoid vector efflux.\nRetract the cannula and discard it in a biohazard sharps container.\nOptionally, inject a small quantity (≤1 µL) of fluorescent microbeads near the vector injection site to facilitate identification of the injection site post mortem.\nRepeat this procedure as desired for the other vector solutions at other locations (Figure 2B).\nSurgery closing\n\t\nSuture the dura, the muscle, and the skin.\nRemove the monkey from the stereotaxic frame and remove all monitor cables.\nRemove the monkey from isoflurane anesthesia and extubate following the return of the swallowing reflex.\nProvide post-surgical treatment (3-5 days of meloxicam and 7-10 days of cephalexin). Monitor the animal at least once every 10 min until it is capable of maintaining a stable upright sitting position.\n3. Surgery and AAV vector injection for awake behaving animals (Figure 1D)\nNOTE: A variant of the technique can be used to make injections into the brains of awake, behaving monkeys, as described below.\nSimultaneous injection with recording\n\t\nTo record electrical activity at the injection site, coat the outside of the cannula with epoxy (bottom ~15 mm) and polyimide tubing (remaining length). Reveal the metal at the tip by scraping the epoxy from it (Injectrode, Figure 1F)2. Alternatively, insert the cannula and a separate extracellular electrode, side-by-side, into a double-barrel guide tube (Double-barrel guide tube, Figure 1E).\nCannula insertion into the target brain area.",
    "Place the monkey in the experimental booth, restrict movement of the head, and clean the cranium-mounted recording chamber using standard techniques.\nSecure a guide tube to the microdrive. Insert the injection cannula into the guide tube.\nAdvance the cannula until the tip protrudes from the guide tube.\nConnect the stopcock to the electric air pump. To confirm proper system function, push a drop of vector solution from the tip using the air pump and confirm movement of the oil-vector solution meniscus.\nWithdraw the cannula ~5 mm into the guide tube to protect it from damage during the tube insertion into the brain. Insert the guide tube into the brain.\nDrive the cannula to the site to be injected using the microdrive. Identify the target site by either electrical recording (Figure 2C) or stimulation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62546/62546fig1v2.jpg",
