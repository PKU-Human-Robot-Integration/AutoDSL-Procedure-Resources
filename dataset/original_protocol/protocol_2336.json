Human iPSCs are cultured under feeder-free conditions and should be passaged once the culture reaches approximately 70% confluency.\nPrepare 6-well plates coated with vitronectin prior to thawing an iPSCs frozen vial as described below. A 6-well plate is sufficient for one differentiation, with approximately 80% confluency and 1–1.5 million cells obtained per well at the end of the differentiation.\nThaw a vial of 2 mL vitronectin at RT. Once thawed, make aliquots for 3 wells (120 μL) and 6 wells (240 μL) of a 6-well plate. Aliquots can be kept at −20°C for long-term storage.\nDilute vitronectin in D-PBS by adding 40 μL of vitronectin per 1 mL of D-PBS, to a final concentration of 10 μg/mL. Scale it up accordingly for the necessary wells needed in the 6-well plate. This should be prepared fresh and used at the same day.\nAdd 1 mL diluted vitronectin to each well. Swirl the volume across the well to cover the entire surface and incubate the plate at room-temperature in the laminar flow cabinet.\nAspirate the vitronectin before seeding the cells.\nNote: Do not let the plate dry before seeding the cells, only remove the coating just before adding the cell suspension.\nThaw a cryovial of human iPSC by gently swirling it in a pre-warmed 37°C water bath until there is only a small blob of ice remaining in the vial.\nDry and spray the cryovial with 70% ethanol.",
    "In a laminar flow cabinet, transfer the cell suspension gently with a 1 mL pipette to a 15 mL conical tube containing 5 mL of E8 culture medium supplemented with 10 mM Y-27632.\nAdd 1 mL of E8 + Y-27632 solution dropwise to the cryovial with a 5 mL stripette, then gently collect and transfer the entire cell suspension to a 15 mL Falcon tube. This should be prepared fresh and used at the same day.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 g for 3 min at RT.\nDuring this time, aspirate vitronectin from the 6-well coated culture plate.\nAfter centrifugation remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 6–12 mL E8 + Y-27632 and transfer 2 mL into each of the vitronectin-coated wells.\nSwirl the plate gently to ensure even distribution of cells across the wells and place it in a tissue culture incubator set at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nCheck cell attachment under a phase contrast microscope after 24 h.\nIf attachment is good, replace the medium with 2 mL E8 without Y-27632. If there are more cells floating than attached, top up with 1 mL freshly made E8 culture medium containing 10 mM Y-27632. This should be prepared fresh and used at the same day.\nNote: We recommend splitting the cells from a cryovial frozen from one well (equivalent to 1 million cells) into 3 wells with a higher density (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, left) and 3 wells with a lower density (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, right), to monitor how different cells recover upon thawing.",
    "Medium change should be done every day for best results with E8 cell culture medium. Once per passage, cells may be double-fed (4 mL) for two days. The cells will be ready to be passaged in about 3–5 days, depending on the growth rate and recovery of the cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1944-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Scale bars, 50 μm (A, B, D and E) and 30 μm (C).\nAdapted from Cujba et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].\nNote: Example of healthy hiPSCs and differentiated unhealthy colonies are shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B. If hiPSC colonies look differentiated, the best colonies can be selected for further expansion by manual picking with a pipette, splitting and replating, or use of ReLeSR. However, it is recommended to rethaw new cells if colonies look differentiated and unhealthy.\nOnce the colonies reach about 70% confluency, proceed to cell passaging by coating a full 6-well plate with Vitronectin. Cells may also require passaging if levels of differentiation start to exceed that of iPSC or colonies start to look overgrown or unhealthy. One 6-well plate could be directly used for the human iPSC differentiation.",
    "Note: Count the number of total cells needed for the different conditions (500,000 cells per well of a 12-well plate or 42,000 cells per well of a 96-well plate) prior to setting up the necessary plates through detailed experimental design.\nEstablished iPSCs cultures can be split 1:4 to 1:6 (i.e., splitting colonies from one well to four or six wells, respectively).\nWash cells with 2 mL of D-PBS.\nIf a high proportion of differentiated cells is observed, scrap and remove huge clusters of differentiated cells under the laminar flow hood microscope using sterile tips (only if necessary).\nAdd 1 mL of 0.5 mM EDTA solution (tissue culture grade) and swirl the plate gently to cover all the surface.\nIncubate the plate at RT for 4–8 min or in the incubator at 37°C for 3–5 min. Observe them under a phase contrast microscopy until colonies display bright halos around the edges and small holes start to appear throughout the colonies indicating detachment.\nAspirate the EDTA solution.\nUse a 1 mL pipette and add 2 mL E8 medium on top of the cells to detach them with mechanical force.\nTransfer the colonies to a 15 mL tube.\nNote: There is a tendency for the cells to differentiate more at the edges of the well, hence try to detach the healthy ones from the middle of the well. There is no need to passage all the cells, as the first passage after thawing usually does not expands the healthiest of the colonies.\nIncubate the 15 mL tube for 3 min at RT inside the laminar flow cabinet.",
    "Note: The undifferentiated clusters will sink first at the bottom of the tube while the most differentiated cells will stay for longer at the top of the tube due to gravity, ensuring a physical separation of the differentiated versus non-differentiated cells.\nCarefully, aspirate the single cells at the top of the tube and leave the clusters that sunk down.\nAdd 1 mL of E8 medium on top of the cells and resuspend once or twice slowly to make smaller clusters.\nCritical: Avoid generating a single-cell suspension by resuspending too harshly or too many times. The gentler the pipetting is, the most likely the small clusters will recover well upon passaging. Single cells obtained by harsh culturing conditions will likely result in differentiated colonies and poor cell survival.\nAdd around 3–6 drops of the cell suspension/per well onto a new plate coated with vitronectin. Adjust cell density as necessary, but usually a lower density allows for growth of healthier colonies.\nSwirl plate gently and incubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nChange the culture medium daily.\nThe newly passaged 6-well plate should reach 80%–90% confluency in 5–6 days and can be used to start the iPSC differentiation.\nCritical: Ensure there are no differentiated colonies in these expanding hiPSC cultures. These colonies show an elongated shape and heterogenous morphologies (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, right) compared to the homogenous healthy hiPSC colonies (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, left). If the differentiated cells only represent a small percentage of the cell culture (<10%), remove them under sterile conditions by scratching with a sterile pipette tip or use of ReLeSR to improve hiPSC passaging. It is also possible to manually pick healthy cell colonies scraping them with a pipette and passing then to a new well. If cell cultures exhibit a big percentage of differentiated cells (>10%), start a new culture.",

In addition, prepare 4 black Greiner 96-well plates for imaging for the 4 differentiation stages: definitive endoderm (DE), primitive gut tube (PGT), posterior foregut (PF), and pancreatic progenitor (PP).\nThaw one vial of hESC-grade Matrigel at 2°C–8°C for 16 h or on ice for at least 4 h. Once thawed, make smaller aliquots using refrigerated pipette tips and store them at −20°C long-term.\nNote: Matrigel is very sensitive to room temperatures, resulting in instant gelling. Always use ice and pre-chilled freezer tube rack for aliquoting and coating plates.\nOnce Matrigel is thawed, mix it with cold DMEM/F-12 medium in the recommended dilution. The final concentration of Matrigel should be 0.12 mg/mL, which approximately will be 12 μL of Matrigel per mL of medium. However, the dilution must be calculated for each lot based on the protein concentration. This mix can be stored at 2°C–8°C for 1 week.\nFor coating, use 500 μL/well of a 12-well plate for coating and 100 μL/well for a 96-well plate.\nIncubate the plates for at least 1 h at RT or in the incubator under sterile conditions.\nWarm at RT mTeSR™1 medium, DMEM/F-12 and Accutase for hiPSC cell seeding.\nAdd Y-27632 to mTeSR™1 to a final concentration of 10 μM to make single-cell passaging medium. This should be prepared fresh and used at the same day.\nWash the expanded hiPSCs with 1 mL of D-PBS.\nAspirate D-PBS and add 1 mL of Accutase.",
    "Incubate at 37°C for 8–10 min. Depending on the cell line, this step might take only 3–5 min; optimize this for your cell line.\nCollect the cells by pipetting up and down 1–3 times using a pipettor with a 1 mL tip. Make sure all remaining cell aggregates are broken up into single cells.\nImmediately transfer cells to a tube with an equal volume of DMEM/F-12. Wash the well with 1 mL of DMEM/F-12 to take any remaining cells and transfer to the tube. Centrifuge the tube at 300 g for 5 min at RT.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL of single cell passaging medium and count the cells with a hemocytometer.\nAdd cells at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well (for 12-well plates) and 0.42 × 105 cells/well (for 96-well plates) to coated plates.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h in the tissue culture incubator.\nNote: After 24 h, considerable cell death will be observed in the wells following attachment, this is normal. Wash the cells with HBSS before adding the induction medium to avoid carryover of dead cells.\nStep 2: Differentiation of human iPSCs to pancreatic progenitors\nTiming: 15 days\nThis section describes the differentiation of expanded human iPSCs to pancreatic progenitors in 2D using the STEMdiff™ Pancreatic Progenitor Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions with small adjustments. The differentiation can be assessed by the formation of PDX1+/NKX6.1+ pancreatic progenitors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: The section below is written and adapted from the original commercial publication (STEMdiff™ Pancreatic Progenitor Kit, STEMCELL Technologies, https://www.stemcell.com/products/stemdiff-pancreatic-progenitor-kit.html[href=https://www.stemcell.com/products/stemdiff-pancreatic-progenitor-kit.html]) and contains small changes optimized to work with our cell lines.",
    "Note: 6 different media are required for the 4 stages of the differentiation protocol, including Definitive Endoderm (DE, Stage 1), Primitive Gut Tube (PGT, Stage 2), Posterior Foregut (PF, Stage 3), Pancreatic Progenitor (PP, Stage 4). Prepare each medium as described below. Medium 1A and Medium 1B may both be prepared on Day 1 of Stage 1; Medium 2A and Medium 2B may both be prepared on Day 1 of Stage 2. Store prepared media at 2°C–8°C until warmed at 37°C for use. After preparing the required volumes of media, remaining supplements should aliquoted and stored at −20°C to avoid unnecessary freezing-thawing cycles. Do not exceed the expiration date of the supplements. Supplements must be used immediately after thawing. Do not re-freeze.\nStage 1: Differentiation to definitive endoderm\nTiming: 3 days\nMake the necessary volume of Medium 1A (Endoderm Basal Medium + Supplement MR + Supplement CJ) for Day 1 of Stage 1 (800 μL/12-well plate and 200 μL/96-well plate).\nThaw entire bottle of Stage 1 Basal Medium at RT or at 2°C–8°C for 16 h.\nMix thoroughly.\nNote: If not used directly, store at 2°C–8°C for up to 2 months or aliquot and store at −20°C.

It is normal to observe cell death in the first stage. To avoid carryover of dead cells, they can be removed by quick washes with pre-warmed HBSS between changing medium daily for this stage.\nStage 2: Differentiation to primitive gut tube\nTiming: 3 days\nMake the necessary volume of Medium 2A (Stage 2–4 Basal Medium + Supplement 2A + Supplement 2B) for Day 1 of Stage 2 (800 μL/12-well plate and 200 μL/96-well plate).\nFor 1 mL medium, on Day 1 of Stage 2, warm (37°C) 1 mL of Stage 2–4 Basal Medium.\nThaw Supplement 2A and Supplement 2B on ice.\nAdd 10 μL of Supplement 2A and 10 μL of Supplement 2B to 0.99 mL of Stage 2–4 Basal Medium.\nMix well and use immediately.",

Successful establishment is based on organoid formation, batch quality of the culture is evaluated by organoid morphology.\nNote: Volumes and procedure are intended for a single well of a 12-well plate.\nPart 1: Establishing 3D organoid culture\nPrepare organoid expansion medium.\nAdvanced DMEM/F-12 with 1× hepes, 1× glutamax, 1× penicillin-streptomycin, 1× B-27, 0.5 nM A83-01, 50 ng/mL EGF, 100 ng/mL FGF10, 10 nM GastrinI, 1× Noggin, 1× R-Spondin, 1.25 mM N-Acetylcysteine and 10 mM Nicotinamide; it can be stored at 2°C–8°C for one week.\nWash the pancreatic progenitors using 2 mL D-PBS, make sure you are very gentle, as the progenitors can easily detach at this stage after 15 days in culture.\nDetach cells using 500 μL of Accutase for 5–10 min at 37°C, check when they are detached under the microscope.\nNeutralize with 5% FBS in D-PBS. This mix can be stored at 2°C–8°C for 1 month.",

This should be prepared fresh and used at the same day.\nChange medium every 2–3 days excluding Y-27631.\nPart 2: Passaging the organoids\nNote: Organoids are usually expanded for 7–10 days before splitting. The split ratio differs due to growth, but usually one well can be split 1:4 or 1:6.\nAspirate medium and wash twice in D-PBS.\nAdd 250 μL TrypLE per well and dislodge Matrigel domes with syringe plunger.\nCollect domes in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube (4 domes per tube).\nIncubate on a Thermomixer™ at 37°C for 5 min at a mixing frequency of 600 RPM (check dissociation of the Matrigel and vortex every 2 min).\nAdd the same volume of D-PBS than TrypLE (for four domes, add 1 mL D-PBS).\nCentrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at RT.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend pellet well in D-PBS.\nCentrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at RT.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend pellet in Matrigel gently to avoid air bubbles and place the tube on ice.

A small percentage of mesenchymal cells is expected but should be kept at minimum (5% of total cells max). Since they are single cells, size separation based on shorter TrypLE incubation and centrifugation, or selection based on E-Cadherin can be performed.\nPart 3: Freezing the organoids\nNote: Try not to expand the organoids beyond passage 8–10, they can stop proliferating as efficiently and accumulate other cell types in culture.

Add 1 mL of fresh double concentrated medium by slowly pipetting in the wall of the well.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C and 5% CO2 in an orbital shaker at 100 RPM inside the incubator for 24 h.",
    "Note: Medium change is performed daily, and cells are incubated in an orbital shaker at 100 RPM inside the incubator until the end of the differentiation. Warm medium before every change.\nOn day 2, change medium to pre-made and pre-warmed medium.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2 in an orbital shaker at 100 RPM inside the incubator for 24 h.\nStage 2: Differentiation to endocrine pancreas\nTiming: 2 days\nPrepare the volume of Stage 2 medium required for day 1 and 2: DMEM 25 mM Glucose with 0.5× B-27, 50 ng/mL EGF, 50 ng/mL FGF7. 1 mL of medium per well and day with double concentration of reagents.\nPerform a 50% of medium change as described before. Store the rest of the medium at 2°C–8°C until the day of intended use.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C and 5% CO2 in an orbital shaker at 100 RPM inside the incubator for 24 h.\nOn day 2, change medium to pre-made and pre-warmed medium.\nIncubate at 37°C and 5% CO2 in an orbital shaker at 100 RPM inside the incubator for 24 h.\nStage 3: Differentiation to immature beta cells\nTiming: 5 days\nPrepare the volume of Stage 3 medium required for day 1 and 2: DMEM 25 mM Glucose with 1× B27, 500 nM LDN-193189, 30 nM TBP, 1 μM ALKi II, 25 ng/mL FGF7. 1 mL of medium per well and day with double concentration of reagents.\nDaily perform a 50% of medium change as described before.

    "Stage 4: Differentiation to mature beta cells\nTiming: 7 days\nPrepare the volume of Stage 4 medium required for day 1–7, since this medium does not contain growth factor and can be stored for longer: DMEM 2.8 mM Glucose, 1× Glutamax, 1× non-essential amino acids. 1 mL of medium per well and day with double concentration of reagents.\nDaily perform a 50% of medium change as described before. This medium can be stored at 2°C–8°C for two weeks.\nIncubate the plate in an orbital shaker at 100 RPM inside the incubator for 24 h until day 7 of Stage 4.\nHarvest spheroids for further analysis.\nUsing a serological pipette or a 2 mL stripette, gently remove approximately the half of the medium from the well.\nDispense the medium back directly to the surface of the well to dislodge the spheroids from the microwells. Do not pipette too much to avoid the deterioration of the aggregates.\nCollect the suspension in a conical tube.\nDispense 1 mL of warm Stage 4 medium across the surface of the well to dislodge the possible remaining aggregates and collect it in the conical tube.\nCheck the wells under the microscope to ensure all the aggregates have been collected. If there are some remaining, repeat the wash with medium.\nOptional: Aggregates can be counted at this point with a hemocytometer to determine the yield.\nStep 4B: Differentiation of pancreatic progenitors into beta cells in 3D organoids\nTiming: 16 days",
    "This section describes an alternative to the previous section for the differentiation of expanded pancreatic progenitors into beta cells, using domes of Matrigel where they have expanded to maintain the 3D structure. The timing and medium used for this section are the same as those reported in the previous one, adapted from (Russ et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Trott et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), with the exception that it is not necessary to wait 24 h to begin the differentiation. This process presents advantages over the aggregates protocol: the medium change is much easier to perform since domes are bigger, they are easier to see and thus more difficult to aspirate or lose; the 3D structure is easier to maintain, since organoids are not disrupted during the process, and they are already formed when it begins; there is no need of special plates. However, the main disadvantage falls on the higher number of mesenchymal cells present in the domes, leading to a relative lower final percentage of endocrine cells.\nNote: 6-well plates are used for this protocol. Up to 10 domes of Matrigel may be grouped in the same well.\nPrepare the volume of Stage 1 medium required for day 1 and 2, described in 156. 3 mL of medium per well and day.\nCollect domes of Matrigel with expanded pancreatic progenitors in a 6-well plate.\nAspirate the medium.\nWash with D-PBS being careful not to disturb the domes.\nWhile in D-PBS and using the plunger of a 1 mL syringe, gently detach the Matrigel domes from the plate, paying attention not to break them.\nCut approximately 1 cm of a 1 mL pipette tip with sterile scissors, making it large enough to fit the Matrigel domes without breaking them.",
    "Gently aspirate the Matrigel domes with the cut pipette tip and transfer them to a new 6-well plate. Domes that will undergo the same treatment may be grouped in the same well up to 10.\nRemove the D-PBS left in the new plate and add 3 mL of warm Stage 1 medium.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C and 5% CO2 in an orbital shaker at 100 RPM inside the incubator for 24 h.\nThe medium changes are the same as in the previous section until day 7 of stage 4, with 24 h of incubation in an orbital shaker at 100 RPM between each change.\nHarvest domes for further analysis.\nMatrigel domes can be directly washed with D-PBS and fixed with PFA for further imaging analysis.\nIf cells retrieving is necessary for nucleic acid or protein extraction, treat the Matrigel domes with 250 μL of TrypLE per dome for 5 min at 37°C. Add 250 μL of D-PBS and pipette up and down to disaggregate the cells. Centrifuge for 5 min at 300 g at RT and aspirate the supernatant."
