    "1. Generation of Spheroids\nPreparing cell suspensions for spheroid formation\n\tNOTE: Different cell lines have very different adhesion properties and the most suitable spheroid formation protocol must be established in each case. We have found that MCF-7 and BxPC-3 cells are suitable for spontaneous spheroid formation, while MDA-MB-231, SKBr-3, Panc-1 and MiaPaCa require the addition of reconstituted basement membrane to successfully form spheroids. Only MDA-MB-231 and BxPC-3 cells have been employed for the hanging drop protocol, however other cell lines are certainly applicable.\n\t\nGrow cells as monolayer until 70-80% confluency.\nWash cells with phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS, 5 mL for a 25 cm2 or 10 mL for a 75 cm2 flask), add the cell dissociation enzyme (0.5 mL for a 25 cm2 or 1 mL for a 75 cm2 flask) and incubate the cells for 2-5 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.\nCheck the cell detachment under a microscope and neutralize the cell dissociation enzyme by adding growth medium (6-10% serum depending on the cell line) to a total volume of 5 mL in a 25 cm2 or 10 mL for a 75 cm2 flask.\nUse a Bürker chamber to count cells and count 8 squares in the chamber per cell preparation to obtain a high reproducibility of the size of the spheroids.\nNOTE: Three protocols each describing a different method for spheroid formation are presented below. Protocol 1.2 and 1.3 can be used for all the subsequent analytic protocols presented, whereas protocol 1.4 is best suited for embedding and lysate preparations. Depending on the cell line, spheroid formation takes 2-4 days, irrespective of the method used.\nSpontaneous spheroid formation\nPerform steps 1.1.1-1.1.4.",
    "Dilute the cell suspension in a 15 mL tube to obtain 0.5-2 x 104 cells/mL (optimal cell density needs to be determined for each cell line) (Figure 1A (ii)).\nFill the outer ring of wells with 1x PBS or growth medium to reduce evaporation from the remaining wells. Transfer the cell suspension to a sterile reservoir and, using a multichannel pipette, dispense 200 µL/well into ultra-low attachment 96-well round bottom plates (Figure 1A (iii)).\nIncubate the plate in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2, 95% humidity.\nEvery 2-3 days acquire light microscopic images of the spheroids.\nNOTE: The images in this paper are taken at 11.5x magnification, which is appropriate for most spheroids prepared using these protocols.\nEvery 2-3 days (after acquiring images) replace 100 µL of medium (remove 100 µL of the spent medium and replace with 100 µL of fresh medium.\nNOTE: To avoid removing spheroids when replacing medium, it is advisable to tilt the plate a bit while slowly removing the medium and inspect the aspirated medium in the tips for visible spheroids before discarding it.\nReconstituted basement membrane-mediated spheroid formation.\n\tNOTE: Lactose dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDEV)-free reduced growth factor reconstituted basement membrane (rBM) was used. rBM is temperature-sensitive and should always be kept on ice, as it will clot if it reaches 15 °C. Thaw the rBM on ice either overnight at 4 °C or 2-4 h at room temperature (RT) before plating.\n\t\nThaw rBM on ice (see Table of Materials).\nKeep plates and reservoirs (if individually wrapped) on ice before use.\nPerform steps 1.1.1-1.1.4.",
    "Fill the outer ring of wells with 1x PBS or growth medium to reduce evaporation from the remaining wells. Dilute the cell suspension in a 15 mL tube to obtain 0.5-2 x 104 cells/mL (optimal cell density needs to be determined for each cell line) (Figure 1A (ii)).\nPlace the 15 mL tube containing the diluted cell suspension on ice (e.g., in glass beaker) (Figure 1A (iia)).\nTransfer the chilled plates and reservoirs to the hood. Rinse plastic containers, fill them with ice and transfer them into the hood to allow the plates and reservoirs to be placed on ice during the entire procedure.\nResuspend rBM gently to ensure a homogenous gel.\nAdd 1-2% rBM (optimal concentration needs to be determined for each cell line) to the chilled cell suspensions (Figure 1A (iib)).\nInvert the 15 mL tube to ensure the proper mixing of rBM and cell suspension before dispensing the suspension into the plate.\nTransfer the rBM-containing cell suspension to a sterile reservoir and dispense 200 µL/well into chilled ultra-low attachment 96-well plates using a multichannel pipette (Figure 1A (iii)).\nNOTE: If working with several cell suspensions (e.g., more than one cell line), it is essential to dispense each cell suspension immediately after rBM addition to prevent premature gelling.\nCentrifuge the plate for 15 min at 750 x g using 'soft decent'/no braking (if possible, centrifuge at 4 °C to keep the rBM fluid longer but not a requirement for successful spheroid formation), to ensure that the cells are clustered together when the rBM hardens, facilitating the formation of one single spheroid.\nIncubate the plate in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity).\nEvery 2-3 days acquire light microscopic images for evaluation of spheroid growth.",
    "Every 2-3 days replace 100 µL of medium (remove 100 µL and replace with 100 µL of fresh medium).\nHanging drop spheroids.\nPerform step 1.1.1-1.1.4.\nDilute cells to obtain a suitable dilution. A practical dilution is 50,000 cells/mL.\nRemove the lid of a 10 cm2 cell culture dish and place it so it faces upwards. Add 6 mL of 1x PBS to the dish (Figure 1B (i)).\nPour the cell suspension into a sterile reservoir and carefully place up to 30 drops of 40 µL of cell suspension onto the lid of the cell culture dish using a multichannel pipette (Figure 1B (ii)), resulting in a concentration of 2,000 cells/drop. Avoid placing the drops too close to the edge of the lid as these drops are more likely to lose surface tension when inverting the lid in the following step.\nInvert the lid in a quick but controlled movement and place it on top of the 1x PBS-containing cell culture dish (Figure 1B (iii)).\nPlace the dish in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity without disturbing the drops and leave them to grow for 4-6 days.\nIf to be used for protein lysates or embedding, pool spheroids by removing the lid and tilt it, in order to wash down the drops with 1 mL of heated medium. Transfer the resulting medium containing spheroids to a 1.5 mL tube and allow them to settle to the bottom of the tube. Proceed as described in 4.4 and 6.2.2 for protein lysates and embedding, respectively.\n2. Drug Treatment of Spheroids",
    "NOTE: Long-term drug treatment can be applied to the spheroids in order to screen for effects of a drug of interest. Before initiating the drug treatment, it is advisable to perform a dose response experiment of the drug(s), in order to find an appropriate dose for the experimental treatment. The doses should be based on the determined IC50/Ki of the drug and range from around 0.2x-10x of this value.\nSet up 6-12 spheroids per the desired condition as described in 1.2 or 1.3 and place in the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2, 95% humidity) for 2 days.\nOn day 2, take light microscopic images of the spheroids.\nPrepare the first treatment doses (after acquiring images).\nNOTE: The first treatment concentration must be twice the desired final concentration as the solution will be diluted 1:2 upon addition to the well containing 100 µL medium. Suggested drug treatment intervals (will depend on drug half-life): Day 2, 4 and 7.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, gently remove 100 µL of medium and replace it with 100 µL of drug containing medium.\nPlace the 96-well plate back in the incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity and repeat 2.3 and 2.4 on the chosen days of treatment but now without doubling the dose to obtain correct final dose.\nOn the final day of the protocol/treatment schedule, one or several of the following assays can be performed.\n3. Cell Viability Assay for Spheroids\nSet up 4-6 spheroids per the desired condition as described in 1.2 or 1.3 and place in the incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.",
    "NOTE: In this case, the cell viability assay was performed on day 7 or 9, after having monitored spheroid growth every 2-3 days by light microscopy as described above (point 1.2.5 and 1.3.13).\nThaw the viability assay reagent (see Table of Materials) and let it equilibrate to RT prior to use.\nMix gently by inverting to obtain a homogeneous solution.\nBefore performing the assay, remove 50% of the culture medium from the spheroids (100 µL).\nAdd cell viability reagent to each well at a 1:3 ratio to the amount of medium present in the well (Figure 2A (i)) For a 96-well plate, add 50 µL of reagent to 100 µL of medium.\nMix the contents vigorously for 5 min to induce cell lysis (Figure 2A (ii)).\nIncubate for 25 min at RT to stabilize the luminescent signal (Figure 2A (iii)).\nRecord the luminescent signal (Figure 2A (iv)).\n4. Preparing Protein Lysates for Western Blotting from 3D Spheroid Cultures\nNOTE: When collecting the spheroids, it is advisable to use a P200 pipette and cut the end of the tip to allow a bigger opening and hence an easier capture of the spheroids without disturbing their structure.\nFor each condition, pool a minimum of 12, ideally 18-24 spheroids (depending on spheroid size) in a 1.5 mL tube (avoid 2 mL tubes, as the next steps will become more difficult due to their less pointy bottom).\nNOTE: If the amount of medium exceeds 1.5 mL before having collected all the spheroids, allow the collected spheroids to settle at the bottom (happens very quickly, centrifugation not necessary) and discard half the volume of the tube before continuing collecting the remaining spheroids.\nPlace tubes on ice and allow the spheroids to settle at the bottom of the 1.5 mL tube.",
    "Move from the sterile cell laboratory to the regular laboratory.\nWash spheroids twice in 1 mL of ice-cold 1x PBS. Let spheroids settle before removing 1x PBS between each washing step.\nAspirate as much 1x PBS as possible without disturbing or removing the spheroids.\nAdd 5 µL of heated lysis buffer (LB) with phosphatase- and protease inhibitors, per spheroid (e.g., 10 spheroids = 50 µL LB).\nRepeat intervals of vortex followed by spin down until spheroids are dissolved. Perform a cycle of vortexing for 30 s followed by centrifugation (a quick spin using a tabletop centrifuge is sufficient) for 10 s for approx. 5-10 min depending on the size and the compactness of the spheroids.\nNOTE: The protocol can be paused here. Keep the lysates at -20 °C until proceeding with sonication, homogenization and protein determination as in a standard 2D protein lysate protocol, followed by western blotting using standard protocols.\n5. Propidium Iodide (PI) Staining of Spheroids\nSet up 3-6 spheroids per desired condition as described in 1.2 or 1.3 and place in the incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity.\nIn a sterile cell culture lab, heat 1x PBS to 37 °C.\nMake a PI solution of 4 µM by diluting stock solution in 1x PBS: Dilute a 1 mg/mL aqueous stock of PI 1:350 in 1x PBS.\nNOTE: This concentration will be further halved upon addition of the solution to the wells giving a final concentration of 2 µM. 100 µL of this solution is needed for each well containing a spheroid.\nCAUTION: Propidium iodide (PI) must be handled in a fume hood and wearing gloves. PI is light sensitive. Protect from light when handling.\nRemove 100 µL of the medium from each well in the 96-well plate without removing the spheroids.",
    "Wash out the remaining medium by adding 100 µL of heated 1x PBS to all wells followed by removing 100 µL of the liquid in the wells. Repeat this washing step 3 times.\nAdd 100 µL of the PI solution to each well, cover the plate in aluminum foil and place it in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and 95% humidity for 10-15 min.\nRepeat the 3 washing steps described in 4.5 to wash out PI solution, in order to diminish background signal when imaging.\nUse an epifluorescence microscope to image the spheroids. To evaluate the viability of cells in the spheroid core take z-stacks to get images with varying depths of the spheroid.\nNOTE: A step size around 18-35 µm between each slice depending on spheroid size is advisable, giving approximately 11-18 stacks per spheroid. Z-stacks can be processed in ImageJ using the z-projection function, which can combine all z-stacks into one final picture, giving an overview of the staining throughout the spheroid (for further guidelines on the use of ImageJ for this purpose, see (https://imagej.net/Z-functions).\n6. Embedding of 3D Spheroids\nPrepare the agarose gel into which the spheroids are embedded (only necessary first time performing the protocol).\nMix 1 g of bactoagar in 50 mL of ddH2O.\nHeat slowly in microwave oven until the bactoagar has dissolved and a homogenous gel has formed. Do not allow the gel to boil.\nKeep the bactoagar warm in a water bath at 60 °C.\nKeep at 4 °C between experiments.\nEmbedding of spheroids.\nOn day 1, for each condition, pool a minimum of 12 spheroids in a 1.5 mL tube.\nWash once with 1 mL of ice-cold 1x PBS.\nTo fix the spheroids, add 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde.",
    "NOTE: Handling of paraformaldehyde should be performed in a fume hood.\nLet them incubate for 24 h at RT.\nOn day 2, heat the agarose gel carefully by placing it in a water-filled beaker in a microwave oven. Ensure that the gel does not boil! Keep warm in a benchtop heating plate, at 60 °C until use.\nWash spheroids twice with 1 mL of ice-cold 1x PBS.\nAspirate most of the 1x PBS (leaving approximately 100 µL at this point is practical for handling the spheroids).\nPrepare a 20 µL pipette by cutting the pipette tip at an incline to obtain a pointier tip with a larger hole (see illustration).\nNOTE: The next part has to be done quickly to ensure optimal spheroid transfer and to avoid solidification of gel drop. If no heating block is available, it is recommended to first catch the spheroids and then make the agarose drop (i.e., switching the order of points 6.2.9 and 6.2.10).\nMake an agarose gel drop on a microscope slide. Place the slide on a warm heating block to prevent the agarose from solidifying.\nUsing the modified pipette tip (see 6.2.8), catch as many spheroids as possible in a volume of 15-20 µL.\nCarefully inject the 15-20 µL spheroid-containing 1x PBS into the center of the agarose gel drop without touching the microscope slide.\nNOTE: This is a slightly difficult point. The spheroids will be lost if the pipette tip touches the microscope slide when injecting the spheroids into the gel drop. It is advisable to practice the whole process of making the agarose drop and injecting the spheroids by injecting a colored liquid into the drop. This will allow visualization of a potential penetration through the drop, as the colored liquid will be leaking out onto the slide.",
    "Let the agarose gel drop harden by incubating for 5-10 min at RT or at 4 °C. Once the gel drop has solidified somewhat (but is still rather soft), carefully push the gel drop from the microscope slide into a plastic tissue cassette with a scalpel.\nCover the plastic tissue cassettes in 70% ethanol.\nNOTE: At this point the spheroids can be used directly or stored for months.\nEmbed the agarose-embedded spheroid in paraffin, section into 2-3 µm thick layer slides and stain with hematoxylin and eosin or subject to immuno-histological staining.\nSubscription Required.
