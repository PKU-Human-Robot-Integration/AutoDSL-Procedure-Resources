  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were approved by the ethical committee of the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU) and in accordance to the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients enrolled at the Texas Children’s Hematology Center (TCHC) were approved by the local IRB and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\n1. General considerations\nBegin by performing a test measurement to warm up the bob and cup. Ensure that the temperature of the bob and cup is 37 ˚C. This is important for good reproducibility.\nEnsure that the viscous polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) solution falls within the strict limits for osmolarity (282–286 mOsm/kg), pH (7.35–7.45) and viscosity (27.5–32.5 MPa) at room temperature (22 ˚C).\n\tNOTE: The PVP must be used at room temperature. If stored at a lower temperature, make sure it has warmed up to room temperature prior to taking any measurements.\n2. Start-up of the ektacytometer\nSwitch on the computer and the ektacytometer from the back. Start the software program (Table of Materials) on the computer.\nMake sure the nitrogen is available to deoxygenate the sample by opening the nitrogen cylinder.\nLower the bob in the cup and make sure the cup can turn freely. Clean the cup on the inside and outside with a soft cloth and distilled water, because debris can hamper the EI measurements.\nWhen the software program is running, check for the following message on the screen: \"Make sure the gas valve is open\" and click OK.\nEnsure that the ektacytometer starts the pO2 self-check process that will appear on the screen. Select Start (enter). If it fails, rerun the self-check by clicking Hardware check | pO2 | Self check.",
    "NOTE: If the self-check fails again, consider replacing the O2-spot. The O2-spot is replaced by gently pushing the spot out from the inside of the cup with a fingertip. A new spot is placed by gently pushing the spot from the outside into the cup.\nChoose pO2 scan from the different tests listed on the left. Choose Settings at the right of the screen and ensure they are set as per the parameters listed in Table 1. Keep the same settings for every measurement.\nIn order to save these settings, press OK | OK.\n\tNOTE: Preferred settings are listed in Table 1 but can be adjusted according to the user preferences and investigational purposes. For example, to study the sickling behavior more extensively, deoxygenation speed and duration can be altered.\n3. Sample collection and preparation\nNOTE: For the validation of the technique, ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)-treated blood from 38 SCD patients and 5 healthy controls included at the University Medical Center Utrecht or Texas Children's Hematology Center, in different clinical studies (Netherlands Trial Registry [NTR] identifier, NTR 6779 and NTR 6462), as well as anonymized leftover blood samples from patients who visited the outpatient clinic or were hospitalized were used.\nCollect blood samples by venipuncture (a minimum of 300 µL/sample) in a tube containing EDTA. Make sure the blood has been stored for at least 30 min at 4 °C, but no longer than 24 h.\n\tNOTE: Citrate phosphate dextrose adenine (CPDA) or heparin can also be used, but the influence of these reagents on the sample preservation with respect to the oxygen gradient ektacytometry is not well-known.\nMix the sample gently by inversion to homogenize. Do not shake the sample. Let the sample warm up to room temperature on a roller bench before the measurement.",
    "NOTE: A sample tube (9–10 mL) that is stored for more than 1 h at 4 ˚C must warm up for 15 min. When stored for less than 1 h at 4 ˚C, it must warm up for 10 min. A sample tube (2–6 mL) that is stored for more than 1 h at 4 ˚C must warm up for 10 min. When stored for less than 1 h at 4 ˚C, it must warm up for 5 min.\nMeasure the complete blood count on a hematology analyzer. To do so, take 20–200 µL of whole blood in a tube containing EDTA. Place the aspiration needle in the tube and press on the button behind the needle of the hematology analyzer to start the measurement.\n\tNOTE: In the complete blood count, the RBC number is measured, which is an important factor for standardizing the oxygen gradient ektacytometry measurements. RBC count is calculated from forward and sideward scatter by flow cytometry. Normal RBC count in healthy controls is 3.7–5.0 x 1012/L for females and 4.2–5.5 x 1012/L for males. RBC count in patients with SCD is generally decreased. Some hematology analyzers will also measure percent dense red blood cells (% DRBC) which can be of additional value in the interpretation of individual oxygen gradient ektacytometry curves.\nStandardize the whole blood sample to an RBC count of 200 x 106 RBCs in 5 mL PVP (200 x 106 RBCs/vial) by adjusting the volume of sample that will be added. If the total RBC count is less than 200 x 106, the diffraction pattern and EI will be affected.\n\t\nUse the equation below to perform the counting.\n\t\t4.0/xx (x 1012/L) x 50 = yy µL whole blood/vial PVP",
    "where xx is the calculated RBC count obtained from step 3.3 and yy is the amount of whole blood that is required for the actual measurement. Depending on the grade of anemia and other factors influencing RBC counts, the amount of whole blood required is 40–90 µL.\n4. Oxygen gradient ektacytometry measurement\nPipette the calculated sample volume (yy µL of blood) into PVP to obtain a total volume of 5 mL. Prewet the tip by gently resuspending the blood 3x. Use a pipette tip with a wide opening to avoid additional stress on the RBCs. Gently mix the sample manually by inversion until it is homogeneous.\n\tNOTE: Open the PVP vial for as short a time as possible to avoid air contact.\nSlowly draw 2.0 mL of the blood/PVP mixture into a 3 mL syringe without the needle. Push the plunger to remove any visible air bubbles and excessive sample solution until 1.5–1.8 mL is left in the syringe (depending on the cup volume).\nInject the total sample volume slowly and evenly in the bob through the connector. Make sure the level of the sample is above the oxygen sensor (pink spot) and above the small suction hole. Do not leave any sample solution in the syringe.\nClick New and fill in the sample identifier, remarks, date of donation, and viscosity of PVP. Click OK |Aspirate. After 60 s, the cup will rotate and aspirate the sample for 15 s. Click OK when the rotation stops. Close the machine lid. Click Continue | Start now, as oxygen gradient ektacytometry is done with a fixed gain. The measurement will take about 28 min.",
    "After the measurement, print the report that shows the curve and parameters that are automatically calculated by the software. Ensure that the raw data is automatically stored in the designated folder in Settings. Maximum EI (EImax), minimum EI (EImin), pO2@95%EI (PoS), and area (area under the curve) are automatically calculated and added to the printed report and raw data.\nManually obtain ΔEI by calculating the difference between EImax and EImin. Calculate the percentage recovery by taking the difference in mean EI before deoxygenation (pO2 100–120 mmHg) and mean EI values during reoxygenation at 100–120 mmHg.\n5. Cleaning of the ektacytometer\nRemove the sample syringe and replace it with a syringe filled with distilled water or deionized water.\nPress Clean, slowly flushing the connector during rinsing. Make sure to flush in both directions.\nRemove the syringe and lift the bob. Dry the bob, cup, and connector thoroughly with a soft cloth.\nUse a large syringe (10–50 mL) to flush the connector in order to remove any water remaining in the tubes and bob. Block the lower inlet/outlet of the bob to get back pressure in the tubes, thereby removing remaining water.\nLower the bob in the cup. The machine is now ready for the next measurement.\n6. Shutdown of the machine\nEnsure the machine is properly rinsed after the last measurement, as described above. Ensure the proper tubes relate to the cleaning solution.\nClose the software, press Close, and press Start to start end-of-day cleaning program.\nAfter completing the whole cleaning program, remove the syringe and lift the bob. Flush the connector with a big syringe.",
    "Empty the waste bottle and dry the bob and cup with a soft cloth. Flush the connector in order to remove the water remaining in the tubes and bob. Block the lower inlet/outlet of the bob to get back pressure in the tubes, thereby removing any remaining water.\nClose the lid of the machine. Close the nitrogen cylinder. Turn off the computer and the machine."
