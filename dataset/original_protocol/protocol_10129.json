    "1. Preparation of Cardiomyocytes\nCoat 6-well plates with basement membrane matrix and culture human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) as previously described17.\nDifferentiate hiPSCs into hiPSC-CMs using previously described methods18.\nAt 16 - 18 d post-differentiation, suspend the cardiomyocytes by rinsing each well with 2 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without calcium or magnesium, followed by incubation with 1 mL/well of trypsin or cell dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) for 5 min at room temperature.\nNeutralize the trypsin or cell dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) using an equal volume of Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) cell media supplemented with B-27 (RPMI/B-27 cell media). Pipette up and down to loosen any adhered cells.\nCollect the suspended cardiomyocytes with a 10-mL serological pipette and transfer them to a 50-mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 250 x g for 5 min at room temperature to obtain a cell pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL of RPMI/B-27 cell media.\nCombine 20 µL of cell suspension with an equal amount of 0.4% Trypan blue solution and mix gently.\nUse a manual hemocytometer to count and obtain the concentration and cell viability of the cell suspension.\n2. Preparation of Fibroblasts\nInitiate a culture of a human cardiac fibroblast (HCF) (adult ventricular type) cell line as described previously16.\nSuspend the HCFs by incubating them with an appropriate amount of trypsin or cell dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) for 5 min at room temperature16. For a T175 flask, 10 mL of trypsin or cell dissociation reagent was used.",
    "Neutralize the trypsin or cell dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) using an equal volume of medium, then transfer the sample to a 50-mL conical tube and centrifuge the cell suspension at 250 x g for 5 min at room temperature to obtain a pellet.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL of fibroblast growth medium (see Table of Materials).\nCombine 20 µL of the HCF cell suspension with an equal amount of 0.4% trypan blue solution and mix gently.\nUse an automated cell counter or manual hemocytometer to count and obtain the concentration and cell viability of the new cell suspension.\n3. Preparation of Endothelial Cells\nInitiate a culture of a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) line as described previously17. Suspend the HUVECs by incubating them with an appropriate amount of trypsin or cell dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) for 3 min at room temperature17. Neutralize the trypsin or cell dissociation reagent (see Table of Materials) using an equal volume of medium, then transfer to a 50-mL conical tube and centrifuge the cell suspension at 250 x g for 5 min at room temperature to obtain a pellet.\n\tNOTE: For a T175 flask, 10 mL of trypsin or cell dissociation reagent was used.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL of endothelial cell growth medium (see Table of Materials).\nCombine 20 µL of the HUVEC suspension and stain it with an equal amount of 0.4% Trypan blue solution and mix gently.\nUse an automated cell counter or a manual hemocytometer to count and obtain the concentration and cell viability of the cell suspension.\n4. Creation of Hanging Drop Spheroids\nPlace the hanging drop device which contains 850 micropores (each with a diameter of 350 µm) into sterile 6-well plates.",
    "Isolate the three types of cells as described above: hiPSC-CMs, HCFs, and HUVECs. Combine them in a ratio of 70% iPSC-CMs, 15% HCFs, and 15% HUVECs in a 50-mL conical tube with RPMI/B-27 cell media at a concentration of 2,475,000 cells per mL.\nDispense 4 mL of the cell suspension (2,475,000 cells per mL) to each well of an ultra-low attachment hanging drop system (with a micropore diameter of 350 µm) seated in a 6-well plate.\nSpheroids will spontaneously form within 12 h of dispensing the cell suspension into the hanging drop device. Continue to culture for a total of 72 h (3 d) at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 95% humidity for the maturation of the spheroids.\nAfter 72 h of culture, harvest the spheroids through the pores at the bottom of the hanging drop system by placing the device into a dish with medium and swirling it gently to release the spheroids from the hanging drop device.\n5. 3-D Patch Creation Using the Novel Net Mold\nThe base, bottom square plate, bottom net, and 10 layered side nets are assembled to create the novel mold with the aid of a pair of sterile forceps. First, stack and align the base, bottom square plate, and bottom net using the corner posts. Then, stack and layer the 10 side nets in alternating directions to create a net of fine stainless-steel prongs.\nFlush the filling base with PBS or medium to reduce the surface tension and, then, transfer the assembled mold onto the filling base.\nWet the net mold cavity with PBS or medium in the same method. Slowly fill the spheroids into the presupposed cavity of the desired size (2 x 2 x 1 mm, 4 x 4 x 1 mm, or 6 x 6 x 1 mm).",
    "Note: Make sure that 120% of the anticipated volume of spheroids is fed into the cavity so that the cell aggregates are in tight connection and stay static.\nAssemble the top net and top square plate onto the corner posts and secure the stoppers and holding tubes to prevent a washout of the spheroids.\nTransfer the filled net mold system to a 6-well plate with 6 mL of RPMI/B-27 cell media or into a sterile container with enough medium to cover the entire assembled mold.\nIncubate the 6-well plate with the filled mold system on a swinging shaker for 7 - 10 days at 3,000 - 4,000 x g.\n\tNOTE: The duration of the incubation is decided by the size of the cardiac patches. With larger patches, the incubation time will need to be increased for cardiac patch maturation.\n6. Removal of the Patch from the Novel Net Mold\nRemove the mold system from the media and place it on the sterilized handling mat in a sterile 10-cm dish.\nRemove the holding tube, stoppers, the top square plate, and the top net. Carefully slide out the layered side nets one by one with a pair of sterile forceps. After decannulation, an intact cardiac patch is obtained atop the bottom net.\nPick up the bottom net with the patch using sterile forceps and transfer the bottom net into a 35-mm dish with 5 mL of RPMI/B27 media. Gently loosen the patch from the bottom net by slowly swirling the net in the dish, or with a sterile cell scraper. After detachment from the bottom net, the cardiac tissue can be cultured with RPMI/B27 media.",
    "Continue to incubate the free-floating 3-D cardiac patch in the 35-mm dish. Functional synchronous beating can be observed as early as 24 h after the removal from the mold.\nAfter removing the patch from the net mold, observe that its shape is maintained with integrity and the intensity of synchronous beating increases with time.\n\tNOTE: The 3-D net mold-based cardiac patches exhibited electrical integration of component cardiospheres after decannulation. We observed a beating frequency ranging from 60 to 80 beats per minute that persisted for more than 60 days.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
