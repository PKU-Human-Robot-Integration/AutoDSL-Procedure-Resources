    "All methods described here have been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Department of Psychology of University Lyon 2 and informed consent was obtained from all participants.\nNOTE: Participants were recruited by means of notices posted in the local community and at the University.\n1. Participants\nEnsure that participants have a driving license and at least two years of driving experience.\nEnsure that participants have normal or corrected to normal vision and audition.\nEnsure that participants do not suffer from a mental illness (e.g., schizophrenia).\nRecruit a similar number of females and males.\nEquip participants with a heart rate belt linked to a watch to monitor heart rate.\nAsk participants to choose freely their own preferred music track (examples of participants choice: Uptown Funk by Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars or Cheerleader by OMI). Ask participants to provide that music track on a USB stick. Use this track to create different musical backgrounds for the experiment (see section 3).\n2. Driving simulation\nNOTE: The following steps are described based on a new driving simulator, a BB_Sim developed at the Université de Sherbrooke, which includes one computer, three screens, as well as a steering wheel and acceleration and braking pedals for driving controls. The initial study was conducted with a different driving simulator using the open-source OpenSD2S software18.\nSet the driving simulation driving noise (i.e., engine of the driven vehicle) at ± 25dB.\nSeat the participant in front of the simulator, approximately 60 cm from the screens (three screens located in front of the participant, 48 cm x 30 cm each, covering a total of 137.52° of the visual angle on the horizontal axis and 28.65° of the visual angle on the vertical axis), in a modified car seat.",
    "Let the participant adjust the distance between the seat and the pedals with the handle underneath the seat.\nOnce the participant is comfortably positioned, provide instructions on using the features of the simulator (i.e., how to interact with the acceleration and braking pedals and the steering wheel).\nInform the participant about simulation sickness that can sometimes occur, and let the participant know that the simulation will be stopped at any time if necessary.\nUse a rural roadway with one traffic lane per direction with five left bends and five right bends and without any traffic.\n3. Musical background\nUse software to modify the tempo of the music, without any pitch modification.\nCreate four auditory backgrounds for each participant: (1) No Music, with no additional music played; (2) Music, each participant preferred music track without modification; (3) Music +10, each participant preferred music track with an increased tempo. The tempo is increased by 10 % of the regular tempo; (4) Music-10, each participant preferred music track with a decreased tempo. The tempo is decreased by 10 % of the regular tempo.\nControl the intensity of the music. Music intensity is known to modify driving performances19. Set the intensity to 75 dB for all auditory backgrounds but the No Music condition.\nUse a software to play one of the four musical backgrounds for the entire duration of each drive. Play the music on two lateral powered monitor speakers located on the right and on the left of the participant.\n4. Simulated car-following task",
    "Provide instructions concerning the task: \"Drive as you would do in a real-life situation. Your goal is to follow the vehicle in front of you at a close but safe constant distance, as if following a friend on an unknown route.\" Inform the participant that there is no traffic or obstacles on the path.\nStart the simulation with a training phase in order to familiarize the participant with the driving simulator, the simulated environment, the vehicle controls, and the car-following task. When the participant feels comfortable, stop the training phase.\nProceed with the experimental drives. Launch the simulated car-following task and one of the four musical backgrounds.\nStart recording the heart rate data at the beginning of each simulated car-following task and end it at the end of that driving task.\nFor the simulated car driving task, have the driver first drive for 50 m before stopping at a \"Stop\" sign. Once the participant’s vehicle has stopped, a leading vehicle appears on the road at the left of the intersection. Instruct the participant to follow the vehicle. After an initial phase in which the speed of the leading vehicle is stationary and set at 20 kph allowing the driven vehicle to catch up, its speed then varies sinusoidally between 45 kph and 70 kph within each period of 60 s for a total of 3 min. Then, ask the participant to stop driving.",
    "For the car-following task, use a two-lane road with opposite traffic directions. In order to provide a realistic driving environment, use a road section with a balanced number of left (n = 5) and right bends (n = 5) with various radii of curvature from 45 m to 300 m. Additionally, add visual elements on the edges of the road section such as trees, barriers, fields, and landform.\nRepeat the car-following task for each of the four musical backgrounds. The car-following task takes about 4 min (3 min of actual car-following plus the beginning and ending of the driving simulation).\n\tNOTE: The duration of the car-following task can be extended if required.\nTake a 5 min break between each car-following task to reduce carryover effects.\nCounterbalance the order of presentation of the four musical backgrounds between participants using a Latin square design.\n5. Data collection\nCollect the participants' subjective mood after each condition using the Brief Mood Introspection Scale (BMIS)20 validated in French21,22. This questionnaire provides data on participants' mood on four mood dimensions: pleasant/unpleasant, arousal/calm, positive/tired, and negative/relaxed.\nCollect physiological measures. Compute the mean heart rate and heart rate variability over the entire drive for each experimental condition using the data recorded by the heart rate monitoring watch at a sample per second. In practice, compute mean heart rate by averaging all the data collected during each experimental condition and heart rate variability by calculating the standard deviation on the same data.\nMeasure objective driving behaviors through the mean inter-vehicular time and the inter-vehicular time variability. Record both driven and leading vehicle position and speed at each time step at a sample rate of 60 Hz.",
    "At each time step, compute the inter-vehicular time as the time required for the driven vehicle to reach the position of the lead vehicle if the position of the lead vehicle was frozen and the speed of the driven vehicle was constant.\nAverage all the values collected for a drive to obtain the mean inter-vehicular time and compute the standard deviation on those values to obtain the inter-vehicular time variability.\n\t\tNOTE: Several variables can be computed to qualify driving behaviors during a car-following task. The inter-vehicular time is particularly well-suited as it offers an indication of the safety margin between the driven vehicle and the lead vehicle chosen by the driver.\nSubscription Required.
