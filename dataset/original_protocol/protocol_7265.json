    "Tissue processing (liver, lung, pancreas, and colon)Collect tissueEuthanize mice with CO2 and cervical dislocation.Incise the skin from chin to thorax.Cut away the sternum.Using a 25G butterfly needle attached to a 10 mL syringe with 0.9% saline, insert this into the left ventricle, near the apex of the heart.Cut the right atrium, and perfuse with saline.Collect liver, lung, pancreas, and colon.Fix tissueUse 10 mL of 10% formalin for colon and pancreas, and 20 mL of 10% formalin for liver and lung.Fix at room temperature for 48 h.Dehydrate tissueImmerse tissue in 70% ethanol at room temperature for 15 min.Immerse tissue in 90% ethanol at room temperature for 15 min.Immerse tissue in 100% ethanol at room temperature three times for 30 min each.Immerse tissue in xylene at room temperature three times for 20 min each.Heat paraffin in Isotemp incubator oven.Embed tissue in paraffin at 58°C. As the paraffin will take several minutes to harden, this can be a pause point in the procedure.Cut 5 μm-thick sections using a microtome.Place each section in a water bath, so that it floats, and scoop with a slide to mount the section.Dry slides at room temperature overnight.Deparaffinization, and hydrationImmerse slides through the following solutions:Xylene (pure), three washes of 3 min each.100% Ethanol, two washes of 1 min each.95% Ethanol, two washes of 1 min each.70% Ethanol, one wash of 1 min.Wash with deionized water two times for 3 min each.Heat-induced antigen retrievalAdd 10 mM Sodium Citrate buffer (pH 6.0) to a staining dish with slides, and place into a pressure cooker or in microwave to bring to the boil for 10 min, using full power. Then, maintain at half power for 10 min (total of 20 min).",
    "For proteinase K retrieval, add 200 μL onto the section, incubate at room temperature for 5 min, and follow step C.4.Allow to cool down at room temperature for 30 min.Wash slides in distilled water for 5 min.Wash slides in PBS-T three times for 5 min each.Peroxidase quenchingTo block endogenous peroxidase activity:Quench section in 3.0% hydrogen peroxide in PBS-T for 10 min.Wash slides in PBS-T three times for 5 min each.Permeabilization and blocking of non-specific bindingPermeabilizationWash sections in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS once for 10 min.Wash slides in PBS-T three times for 5 min each.BlockingBlock non-specific binding, by incubating the tissue section in 10% goat serum in PBS-T at room temperature for 25 min.Antibody incubationPrimary antibody staining in Dako antibody diluent, as per dilutions in notes below.Incubate at room temperature for 1.5 h.Wash in PBS-T three times for 5 min each.Secondary antibody staining.Add biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200) and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.Wash in PBS-T three times for 5 min each.DetectionABC (avidin/biotinylated enzyme complex) method:Prepare working solutions of reagent A (avidin) and B (biotinylated HRP) in PBS at 1:50 dilution, 30 min prior. To prepare 1:50 dilution, add 100 μL of each reagent into 5 mL of PBS.Incubate tissue sections at room temperature for 30 min.Wash in PBS three times for 5 min each.Prepare DAB (3,3'Diaminobenzidine)Determine the volume of DAB needed (100 μL per section). Following the manufacturer’s instructions, add one drop of DAB per milliliter of substrate buffer.Warning: Wear gloves, and work in the fume hood. Add 100 μL of DAB working solution to each section. The biotinylated antibody with HRP will oxidize DAB and produce a brown precipitate at the site of the antigen. Monitor the slide every 5 min to visualize the brown color.",
    "When the desired staining develops brown color, wash slides with deionized water.CounterstainingCounterstain using hematoxylin.Immerse slides in hematoxylin to cover the tissue sections.Incubate for 16 s.Rinse section with tap water, until water is colorless.Dip slides ten times in acid rinse solution, followed by ten dips in tap water.Incubate slides in bluing solution.Note: Hematoxylin is filtered once a week. Slide dehydration, and mountingDehydrate slides by passing through the following solutions twice for 1 min each:95% Ethanol100% EthanolXylene (pure)Mount coverslipsUsing a transfer pipette, add one drop of mounting media per slide and place the coverslip. Allow to dry for 1–2 h.Slide visualizationScan slides with a Leica SCN400, or use a microscope to visualize the tissue sections (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4468/bioprotoc-12-14-4468-g001.jpgFigure 1.
