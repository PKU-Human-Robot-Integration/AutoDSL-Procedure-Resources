    "Prepare for Arabidopsis protoplastsHealthy rosette leaves from Arabidopsis thaliana (3 weeks) were sliced with a razor blade into small leaf strips (0.5-1 mm).The leaves were covered with enzyme solution in a petri dish and placed in a vacuum chamber connected to a vacuum pump, and approx. 100 to 400 mmHg of vacuum was applied for 30 min. The leaves were then incubated in the dark for 3 h without shaking at room temperature.The digested sample was filtrated through a 75 µm nylon mesh, the crude protoplast filtrates were sedimented by centrifugation for 3 min at 100 x g at room temperature.The purified protoplasts were suspended in W5 solution.Al treatment for Arabidopsis protoplasts10 μl AlCl3 solution in Ca medium was added to 90 µl of protoplast solution in 96-well plates.The protoplasts were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in darkness.The protoplasts were incubated with 50 µM FDA for 5 min and Al-induced protoplast death was observed by confocal microscopy (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150702/20150702084020_5816.jpgFigure 1. Al-induced protoplast death. Viability of wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis protoplasts after 0.5 mM Al treatment. Protoplasts (2 x 105/ml) were incubated with 50 µM FDA and observed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope.RNA extraction and quantitative RT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted from Arabidopsis protoplasts according to the manufacturer’s instructions using TRI reagent.The concentration of RNA was determined by measuring A260 using BioPhotometer. 4 μg RNA was used for reverse transcription PCR.First strand cDNA was synthesized with SuperScript II First strand synthesis system for qRT-PCR. Eppendorf BioPhotometer was used to determine the concentrations of cDNA.The transcript of AOX genes were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR using ACTIN2 as an endogenous control. The AOX1a gene was amplified with the primers 5’-ATGATGATAACTCGCGGTGGAGC-3’ and 5’-GCAACATTCAAAGAAAG CCGAATC-3'. PCR was carried out using 50 ng of cDNA and SYBR PCR Master Mix following the manufacturer’s protocol.",
    "For quantitative RT-PCR analyses, the Light Cycler 2.0 instrument was used to run the two-step program. PCR cycling conditions for amplification were 95 °C for 30 sec followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 5 sec, 55 °C for 30 sec.Relative expression levels were calculated using the 2(-∆∆Ct) analysis method.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150702/20150702084031_6108.jpgFigure 2. qRT-PCR analysis of the gene expression levels of AOX1a gene in Al-treated WT protoplasts Protein extraction and western blotThe treated protoplasts were re-suspended in lysis buffer and incubated on ice with gentle shaking on a level shaker for 30 min.The samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 1,2000 x g at 4 °C, and the supernatants were transferred to new 1.5 ml tubes.Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (Bio-Rad protein assay kit).Proteins extracts were separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulphate- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).The gel was transferred to PVDF membranes and then electrophoresis for 45 min.The membrane was blocked with TBST containing 5% non-fat milk for 1 h.The membrane was incubated with anti-AOX antibody or anti-Rubisco antibody at 4 °C overnight.The membrane was washed with TBST three times (about 10 min each time), and then incubated with secondary antibody [AOX: Anti-rabbit IgG (DylightTM800 4x PEG Conjugate) secondary antibody; Rubisco: Anti-mouse IgG (DylightTM800 Conjugate) secondary antibody] at room temperature for 2 h.When the membrane was dried, detected by using Odyssey two-color infrared imaging system.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150702/20150702084127_8177.jpgFigure 3.

Blots were probed with monoclonal anti-AOX antibody.Quantitative analysis was carried out using Image J 1.43 software (Figure 4). A step-by-step guide on how to use Image J for this purpose is shown in Supplementary data 1[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20150706/20150706061004_4977.ppt].imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150702/20150702084135_9609.jpgFigure 4.
