    "All animal studies were approved by the respective Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) at the Medical College of Wisconsin and Mayo Clinic.\nNOTE: In this study, Yorkshire/Landrace/Duroc cross domestic pigs (Sus domesticus), male and female, 40-80 kg, 3-6 months old, were used.\n1. Collection of porcine peripheral blood\nPrepare materials.\n\t\nDilute heparin solution to 100 U/mL in sterile saline.\nAdd 3-4 mL of heparin solution to each of two 50 mL conical tubes and two 60 mL syringes.\nDraw undiluted heparin solution (1,000 U/mL) into an extension tube.\nConnect a 19 G needle to one end of the heparin-filled extension tube and a heparin-containing 60 mL syringe to the other end.\nAnesthetize a pig according to Institutional policies\n\t\nAdminister an IM injection of atropine (0.05 mg/kg), tiletamine/zolazepam (2-5 mg/kg), and xylazine (2 mg/kg) to induce anesthesia.\n\t\tNOTE: adequate anesthesia is achieved once the animal is unconscious and the mandibular muscles are non-rigid.\nLay the animal in the supine position and place rolled-up towels on both sides to provide stability.\nApply an ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nProvide thermal support during anesthesia including blankets, heating pads, and/or heated procedure table.\nClean the femoral groin area with betadine scrub solution.\nPuncture the femoral vein or artery with the 19 G needle and slowly (~1-2 mL/s) draw 50 mL of blood into the syringe.\n\tNOTE: Drawing too fast can damage the cells.\nLeaving the needle in place, immediately kink the extension tube and disconnect the 60 mL syringe\nSlowly transfer the blood to a heparin-containing 50 mL conical tube.\nTightly cap the 50 mL conical tube, gently invert a few times to mix, and place on ice.",
    "Connect the remaining heparin-containing 60 mL syringe to the extension tube, unkink the extension tube, and slowly draw an additional 50 mL of blood into the syringe.\nImmediately remove the needle from the artery or vein and slowly draw the remaining blood from the extension tube into the syringe.\nDisconnect the 60 mL syringe from the extension tube and slowly transfer the blood to the remaining heparin-containing 50 mL conical tube.\nTightly cap the 50 mL conical tube, gently invert a few times to mix, and place on ice.\nApply pressure hemostasis to the pig's femoral groin area.\nRecover the pig according to Institutional policies. Continuously monitor the animal until it regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency and return to the regular housing/kennel area.\n2. Isolation of mononuclear cells\nDilute the blood 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in four 50 mL conical tubes.\n\tNOTE: This work needs to be performed in a cell culture hood using an aseptic technique to avoid contaminating the cell culture.\nAdd 25 mL of room temperature ready-to-use density gradient solution to eight 50 mL conical tubes.\nVery slowly pipette 25 mL of blood/saline solution along the inside of each density gradient solution containing 50 mL conical tube by holding the tube at a sharp angle to the pipette tip.\n\tNOTE: The blood solution should gently layer on top of the density gradient solution and maintain a well-defined interface.\nCentrifuge the tubes for 30 min at 560 x g and room temperature (RT).\n\tNOTE: For best results, disable the centrifuge brake if possible.",
    "Use a thin pipette to carefully collect the buffy coat (cloudy layer of mononuclear cells above the density gradient solution and below the clear plasma) from each tube and distribute evenly into two new 50 mL conical tubes. Discard the density gradient solution containing tubes.\n\t​NOTE: Collect as much of the buffy coat as possible while collecting as little of the density gradient solution and plasma as possible.\n3. Washing and plating of cells\nCoat a 6-well plate with fibronectin.\n\t\nMake a stock solution of human plasma fibronectin by diluting it to 1 mg/mL in sterile water. Store the aliquots at -20 °C.\nMake 3.6 mL of a working solution of fibronectin by diluting 600 µL of fibronectin stock solution in 3 mL of PBS.\nTransfer 600 µL of the fibronectin working solution into each well of a 6-well plate and gently rock until evenly coated.\nWait 30 min for the fibronectin to coat the wells and gently aspirate the solution out of each well.\nWhile waiting for the fibronectin to coat, wash the mononuclear cells\n\t\nTop up the tubes with up to 45 mL of PBS\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 560 x g and 4 °C with low brake. Aspirate the supernatant from both tubes.\nResuspend each cell pellet in 25 mL of PBS.\nRepeat to wash a second time.\nResuspend each cell pellet in 5 mL of PBS and add 15 mL of 0.8% ammonium chloride solution to each tube.\n\tNOTE: This step is to lyse the remaining red blood cells.\nIncubate on ice for 10 min.\nWash the cells as before by topping up tubes with PBS and centrifuge for 5 min at 560 x g and 4 °C with low brake. Aspirate the supernatant from both tubes.",
    "Resuspend each cell pellet in 25 mL of PBS and repeat to wash a second time.\nResuspend each cell pellet in 6 mL of EGM-2 culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1x antibiotic/antimycotic solution containing 10,000 U/mL penicillin, 10 mg/mL streptomycin and 25 µg/mL amphotericin.\n\tNOTE: EGM-2 culture medium consists of EBM-2 culture medium supplemented with 200 µL of hydrocortisone, 2 mL of human fibroblast growth factor (hFGF-B), 500 µL of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), 500 µL of recombinant analog of insulin-like growth factor (R3 IGF-1), 500 µL of ascorbic acid, 500 µL of human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), 500 µL of gentamicin/amphotericin, and 500 µL of heparin per 500 mL.\nGently transfer 2 mL of the cell suspension to each well of the fibronectin-coated 6-well plate and gently rock until evenly coated.\n\t​NOTE: The goal is to seed as many cells as possible to maximize the number of endothelial colonies that will form.\n4. Cell culture\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity.\nOn the next day, gently add 1 mL of fresh culture medium to each well.\n\tNOTE: it is important to be gentle not to disturb cells that are loosely adherent to the fibronectin coating.\nOn the next day, perform a half culture medium change by gently aspirating 1.5 mL of culture medium from each well and replacing it with 1.5 mL of fresh culture medium.\nOn each of the next 5 days, gently perform a full culture medium change to each well (2 mL of fresh culture medium per well).\nAfter that, gently change the culture medium three times per week.\nRegularly visualize the cell cultures under low power (4x objective) light microscopy.",
    "NOTE: Adherent blood outgrowth endothelial cell (BOEC) colonies will begin to appear in the wells 7-10 days after plating. Non-adherent cell types will be discarded with medium changes, and other adherent cell types will gradually dissipate as the BOEC colonies grow.\nPassage the BOECs into a fibronectin-coated T-75 flask when ~70%-80% confluent and continue changing culture medium three times per week.\n\tNOTE: Seeding density can be controlled by passaging colonies into a T25 flask instead. Subsequent passages do not require fibronectin-coating, and culture medium changes can be reduced to two times per week.\nCells from passages 1-3 may be used for experiments or transferred to a freezing medium and stored in liquid nitrogen for future use.\nSubscription Required.
