All steps are performed under a laminar flow cabinet.\nEmbed brain in 4% low melting agarose preheated at 42° Celsius (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] and Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2576-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Obtaining brain slices in the vibratome\n(A) Embedded brain in low-melting agarose and peel away molds.\n(B) Trimmed agarose block is fixated to vibratome platform in coronal position using glue.\n(C) The platform including the brain is fixed inside the vibratome buffer tray and covered entirely by ice-cold HBSSsup.\n(D) Divided brains stored in ice-cold HBSSsup. Scale bar: 10 mm.\n(E) Brain slices in single wells of a 24-well plate for BLI.\nTransfer brain to a 10 cm plate with HBSSsup.\nDry the brain by holding it with a forceps and gently tapping it in a dry 10 cm plate.\nFill the Peel Away Disposable Embedding Mold with 4% low melting agarose preheated at 42° Celsius.\nImmerse brain in the mold with 4% agarose.\nEnsure full coverage of the brain surface with agarose by gently stirring the melted agarose with a 20–200 μL tip around the brain (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nPlace the mold on ice and use the tip to gently position the brain in coronal position with the region of most interest upwards. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: The region of interest of each brain depends on the location of the metastases and can be selected based on the corresponding ex vivo BLI image.\nLet the agarose solidify.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Embedding the brain in low-melting agarose, related to step 1",
    "Section the edges and the walls of the mold with a razor blade to extract the agarose block from the Peel Away Disposable Embedding Mold (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nCritical: In steps 2 and 3, be careful to not touch the brain with the razor blade to avoid damage of the tissue.\nTrim the excess of agarose with the razor blade (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nCritical: When performing step 3, ensure that the agarose is covering the brain in all sides of the block, and no brain surface is exposed.\nFixate the trimmed agarose block with the brain inside to the sample holder using instant adhesive glue. The brain is placed in coronal position with the region of most interest upwards (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: If properly trimmed, up to 4–5 brains can be simultaneously placed on the sample holder and sectioned.\nPlace the sample holder inside the buffer tray and fill it with ice-cold HBSSsup (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nKeep the buffer tray cold by surrounding it with ice.\nPlace half of a double-edge razor in the razor-holding arm of the vibratome.\nUse the control panel to fix the settings and initiate sectioning.\nSet the speed (2 mm/s), frequency (5 Hz), and thickness of the slices (250 μm).\nMove the sectioning arm using the forward-reverse option in the control panel to set the initial and endpoint of each section (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S3. Processing of vibratome-cut brain slices, related to steps 7 and 8\n    \nSelect the continuous mode (Cont) and press Start.\nThe vibratome will automatically section the brain based on the settings. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Note: In step 7b, maximum speed (V-max) can be selected to set the initial and endpoints. However, position the buffer tray using the up-down option in the control panel to maintain the razor above the level of the agarose and ensure not sectioning the brain during this process. Remember to unselect V-max before pressing Start.\nCollect brain slices with a spatula and divide each coronal slice into two halves with a needle tip (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nKeep brain slices in a 10 cm plate with ice-cold HBSSsup and on ice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: Collect as many brain slices as needed to ensure that all regions of the brain with metastases, based on the ex vivo BLI image, have been cut. One whole brain yields approximately 25–30 coronal brain slices (before cutting into halves).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S2. Removing of mold and trimming of excess agarose, related to steps 2 and 3\n    \nBioluminescence imaging (day 0) of brain slices\nTiming: 30 min\nIn this section, brain slices with positive bioluminescence signal are selected.\nTransfer the halves of the coronal brain slices (referred to as brain slices hereafter) to a 24-well plate with HBSSsup.\nPipette 1 mL of HBSSsup per well.\nPlace one brain slice per well.\nNote: Step 9 is performed under a laminar flow cabinet. Keep plates on ice while working.\nAdd 20 μL of D-luciferin (15 mg/mL) per mL of HBSSsup, gently shake the plate to mix, and incubate 5 min at room temperature (19°–21° Celsius) in the dark.\nAcquire BLI images at exposure times of 10 and 1 s. If less than half of the total number of slices are positive, repeat the acquisition at higher exposure times (30, 60, or 120 s) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).",
    "Note: Keep plates with brain slices on ice after BLI acquisition until step 14.\nMeasure the BLI signal of each brain slice using the image analysis software Living Image 4.5, and categorize BLI positive brain slices as with high, medium, or low BLI signal.\nNote: Categorization of BLI positive brain slices by level of signal will allow to equally distribute high, medium, and low BLI signal brain slices across different treatment conditions when plating and avoid bias.\nBrain slices plating and culture\nTiming: 1 h 30 min\nIn this section, BLI positive brain slices are placed on top of membranes and cultured, resulting in organotypic cultures. All steps are performed under a biosafety cabinet in an equipped room for primary cell culture.\nPrepare 12-well plates with slice culture medium (SCM) and chemical compounds of interest (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) (examples of chemical compounds used are extensively provided in our previous publication by Zhu et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2576-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Plating, imaging, and fixing brain slices\n(A) Membranes floating on SCM.\n(B) Brain slices placed wrinkle-free on membranes.\n(C) Plate with brain slices and luciferin in BLI device for measurement.\n(D) Fixed brain slices, using 4% PFA.\nPer treatment condition, prepare a mix of SCM with the appropriate volume of chemical compound to achieve the desired final concentration.\nPrepare the mix for the corresponding control (i.e., SCM + vehicle) condition.\nAdd 1 mL of mix per well in a 12-well plate.\nUsing a Dumont forceps, place one 0.8 μm pore membrane per well on top of the liquid leaving the matte side of the membrane upwards.\nTransfer BLI positive brain slices with a spatula from the 24-well plates to a 10 cm plate with ice-cold HBSSsup to facilitate manipulation.",
    "Critical: Transfer one slice at a time and annotate the well of origin (in the 24-well plate) and the well where it is plated (in the 12-well plate). This is critical for the subsequent BLI analysis.\nCollect the brain slice with a spatula and gently place it on top of a membrane in the 12-well plate (1 slice per membrane) assisted by another spatula (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4] and Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nRepeat until the plate is completed.\nCritical: Avoid wrinkles in the slice as they will remain in the organotypic culture for the subsequent applications (e.g., histological analysis). Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nGently transfer the plate to a CO2 incubator and ensure all membranes (with their respective slices) are floating. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nIncubate at 37° Celsius and 5% CO2 for 72 h (3 days).\nPause point: 72 h.\nOptional: Organotypic cultures can be maintained up to 7 days in culture in a CO2 incubator. In this case, SCM with respective chemical compounds should be refreshed at day 3, by removing old medium with a pipette and gently adding new medium on the walls of the wells. Do not use a vacuum pump to remove old medium and ensure to not wet the upper surface of the membranes when adding new medium. If correctly done, membranes with their respective organotypic cultures on top should float with the addition of new medium.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S4. Plating brain slices on membranes, related to step 14\n    \nBioluminescence imaging (day 3) and fixation of organotypic cultures\nTiming: 30 min\nIn this section, cultured brain slices or organotypic cultures are subjected to BLI and fixation.\nAdd 20 μL of D-luciferin (15 mg/mL) per mL of SCM in the 12-well plate, gently shake the plate to mix, and incubate 5 min.",
    "Critical: The plate should be visually examined right after taking the plate from the incubator and before preparing for BLI acquisition. Organotypic cultures found to be not attached to their membrane or attached but with their membrane not floating are not viable and should be discarded from the analysis.\nAcquire BLI images at exposure times of 10 and 1 s. If higher exposure times (30, 60, or 120 s) were used at day 0 BLI, then acquire additional images at the corresponding exposure times (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nRemove SCM and fix organotypic cultures by adding 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) to each well (Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5] and Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nShake overnight (min. 12 h) at 4° Celsius.\nRemove 4% PFA and wash 3 times with 1× PBS.\nStore fixed organotypic cultures in 1× PBS at 4° Celsius.\nNote: Steps involving 4% PFA are performed under a fume hood. For long-term storage, maintain fixed organotypic cultures in 0.25% sodium azide (in 1× PBS) at 4° Celsius. Replace liquid periodically to avoid dry up.\nCritical: Add 4% PFA through the wall of each well and not on top of the organotypic cultures. Use the tip to push the membrane with the slice into the liquid to allow full submergence and coverage of the slice by the liquid.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S5.
