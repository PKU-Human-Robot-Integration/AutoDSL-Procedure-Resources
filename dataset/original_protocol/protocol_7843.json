    "A 5 ml pre-culture of cells is grown in EMM plus supplements over night. The next day, the cells are refreshed in a 20 ml culture until exponential growth, which is done by diluting 1 ml pre-culture with 19 ml fresh EMM (1:20). Cell number can be measured via optical density measurements on a spectrometer. To obtain cells in exponential growth, an OD600 = 0.1 – 0.2 should be achieved. This would approximate to a cell number between 2 x 106 cells/ml – 1 x 107 cells/ml. An OD600 = 1, is linear to the cell number.   Imaging culture dishes with a glass-bottom are covered with 1 μl Lectin (2 mg/ml) and left to dry.   100 μl of cells in EMM from the culture are added to the dish and left to settle for 10 minutes.   Cells, which were stuck to the dish via lectin, are washed once with 2 ml EMM to remove loose/un-attached cells, and 1.5 ml EMM is added.   FRAP Experiments are performed at room temperature in three successive steps (a. b. c. see below) controlled by Andor iQ2 software. Ideally 30 – 50 cells are measured and analysed.   Prebleach: after focusing the cell of interest, a time-lapse of 50 images of a single plane of the nucleus is acquired with 50 ms exposure time with a 488 nm laser, at 10-15% (details see above, emission filter is BL HC 525/30).    Bleach: bleaching is performed on a 2 x 2 square pixel area (inside the nucleus, away from the nucleolus) with 50% of the 488 nm laser, with a dwell time of 1 ms and 2 repeats on each pixel (details above, emission filter is BL HC 525/30).",
    "Postbleach: following the bleaching, imaging is continued as before for 400 times with 50 ms exposure time of 10-15% of the 488 nm laser (emission filter is BL HC 525/30).  Note: It is important to establish the appropriate laser exposure time and intensity before the FRAP experiment in a ‘not saturated fluorescence condition’ (Arbitrary units of fluorescence go from a range of 0 – 255. In order to have non- saturated conditions, the laser has to be set to an average saturation above 0 but below 255) to avoid excessive bleaching and allow fluorescence quantification for further analysis. This might mean that the image quality is rather poor.     Analysis   Briefly, a region of interest (ROI, see Figure 1) with a width of 5 pixels and a length roughly equal to the length of the nucleus, L, is drawn.   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131017/20131017195743_4817.jpg Figure 1. FRAP experiments on GFP in the nucleus of fission yeast. From left to right: A scheme and 3 images of a cell expressing NLS-GFP (strain PD31, Kalinina et al., 2013) before photobleaching (-2.95 s), just after photobleaching (0 s), and the subsequent image (0.059 s). The cross in the middle panel marks the center of the bleached region (2 x 2 pixels). A region of interest (ROI, magenta rectangle) was drawn along the nucleus. Next to the images of the cell, a time-lapse sequence of the enlarged ROI in consecutive images shows the recovery of the GFP. The graph on the right shows the temporal decay of the first Fourier mode. Circles indicate data points, the solid line is a 3-parameter fit (C++) to the function A1(t) = A1(0) exp(-π2Dt/L2) + offset. Here, A1 is the amplitude of the first Fourier mode, t is time, D is the diffusion coefficient, and L is the length of the bleached area.",
    "Figure was taken and modified from Kalinina et al. 2013.    The intensities inside the ROI on each image of the movie are summed along the short axis of the ROI.    The resulting one-dimensional fluorescence intensity profiles, corresponding to consecutive time points, are used to calculate the temporal decay of the first Fourier mode.    The diffusion coefficient D was calculated from the decay rate of the amplitude of the first Fourier mode A1(t), as described by Elowitz et al. 1999. For this particular example we get a diffusion coefficient D = 3.7 μm2/s."
