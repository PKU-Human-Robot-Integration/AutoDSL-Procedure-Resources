    "NOTE: Protocols for collection of human tissue must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional IRB committee. Collection of discarded, de-identified human tissue has been approved by the Boston Children’s Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital IRB Committees. The methods described below have been applied for the isolation of myogenic cells from de-identified, discarded tissue. The described methods are applicable to tissue collected from consented patient material.\n1. Cell Isolation\nDissociation of muscle biopsy and purification of myogenic cells\n\t\nPre-weigh a 10 cm tissue culture plate in a tissue culture biosafety hood, and then re-weigh the plate containing the muscle biopsy to calculate the amount of tissue to be dissociated.\nUsing sterile scalpels, mince muscle tissue finely and add a few drops of sterile 1x HBSS to prevent tissue from drying out.\nAdd 3.5 ml each of dispase II and collagenase D per gram of muscle tissue to be digested. Pipette the minced tissue and enzyme solution through a sterile 25 ml pipette a few times. Incubate the plate in a tissue culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 15 min and digest tissue until the slurry easily passes though a sterile 5 ml pipette.\n\t\tNOTE: Tissue dissociation is usually achieved by enzymatic digestion within 45-90 min. Please refer to the ‘Representative Results’ section for additional details.\nAdd 2 volumes of sterile growth medium to dissociated tissue, filter through a 100 µm cell strainer over a 50 ml conical tube and pellet cells for 10 min at 329 x g (~1,100 rpm), room temperature. Please refer to the Materials Table for media composition.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 1 volume of sterile growth medium and add 7 volumes red blood cell lysis solution. Filter the solution through a 40 µm cell strainer, then pellet the cells for 10 min at 329 x g, room temperature.\nCount the cells in a hemocytometer and resuspend the cells in 1x HBSS 0.5% BSA at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/100 µl. Set aside ~250,000 cells in a single tube that will be used as a negative (unstained) control. Set aside additional single-color stained control tubes for propidium iodide and for CD56, which are required for proper gating of CD56 positive cells by FACS sorting. Please refer to cell sorting manuals or consult with FACS sorting core facility experts to ensure appropriate controls are included.\nStain the cells to be sorted with 5µl/106 cells of anti CD56 antibody. Incubate all samples (including controls) on ice for 30 min.\nWash samples in 10 ml 1x HBSS and pellet cells for 10 min at 329 x g (~1,100 rpm) in a refrigerated centrifuge, 4°C temperature.\nAdd propidium iodide at a final concentration of 1µg/ml to the sample to be sorted for exclusion of dead cells. Purify myogenic CD56 positive cells from non-myogenic cells using the fluorescence activated cell sorter.\nDissociation of skin biopsy\n\tNOTE: Dermal fibroblasts can be isolated from a skin punch from patients when muscle biopsies are not available. Dermal fibroblasts can be used as biomaterial for many studies, including transduction with MyoD to generate myogenic cells. Additionally, dermal fibroblasts can be used to generate iPS cells, which can be differentiated into various cell types for further study.",
    "Transport the skin biopsy to the laboratory in transportation medium. Once the sample is received, perform the primary culture as soon as possible. If the primary culture cannot be established on the same day, store the sample at room temperature overnight.\nTransfer the skin biopsy to a sterile 35 mm petri dish in the laminar flow hood.\nRinse the skin biopsy in a petri dish with sterile 1x PBS to remove blood and debris. Remove the adipose tissue with a sterile scalpel.\nAdd 2 ml collagenase solution and mince the tissue with scalpel, incubate at 37 °C for 45 min to 1 hr, depending on the size of the tissue.\nTransfer the digested tissue to a 15 ml conical tube, rinse the petri dish with 2 ml of fibroblast culture medium twice, and collect the medium in the same tube.\nPellet cells at 200 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and wash the pellet with 3 ml of fibroblast medium to remove the collagenase, then pellet cells again. Please refer to the Materials Table for media composition.\nRepeat the step 1.2.7 one more time.\nRe-suspend the pellet in 5 ml fibroblast medium and plate cells onto a T25 sterile tissue culture flask. Incubate the flask at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nEvaluate the culture for fibroblast attachment and growth over the next 1-3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Some small tissue pieces may also attach to the plate and fibroblasts migrate out of these tissue pieces.\nMaintain the culture under the same conditions until fibroblasts are grown to approximately 80% confluence.",
    "Collect fibroblasts by trypsinization and transfer onto fresh culture flasks for additional expansion. Perform trypsinization by washing the cultures 3 times in 1x PBS free of Ca++ and Mg++. Add Trypsin-EDTA (see Materials Table) to the cells (2ml/ T25 flask) for 2 min at 37 °C.\nSplit detached cells into additional flasks. If some tissue pieces remain attached to the original T25 flasks, add 5 ml fresh culture medium to this flask and more fibroblasts will migrate out continually.\n\t\tNOTE: The expanded fibroblast culture can be frozen down as P1 and stored in liquid nitrogen for future experiments.\n2. Immortalization of Myogenic Cells\nPlate 5 million Phoenix Ecotropic packaging cells (PE) overnight in a 10 cm sterile tissue culture plate in DMEM and Medium 199 in a ratio of 4:1, supplemented with 10% calf serum.\nFeed cells 30 min prior to transfection with 5 ml of fresh media supplemented with 10 mM caffeine.\nHomogenize a mixture of 2 μg of plasmid DNA from a midi prep (CDK4 or hTERT plasmid) and polyjet and incubate at room temperature for 15 min, as recommended by the manufacturer.\nAdd the plasmid/polyjet mixture to the PE cells overnight.\nFeed cells with fresh medium (DMEM and Medium 199 in a ratio of 4:1, supplemented with 10% calf serum). Twelve hours later, collect the virus-containing supernatant and filter it through a 0.45 μm pore size filter.\nUse 1 ml of collected supernatant to infect overnight the amphotropic packaging cell line PA317 5 and obtain a stable virus-producing cell line after selection with either 0.5 mg/ml neomycin (G418) for CDK4 or 0.5 mg/ml hygromycin for hTERT.\nPrepare working viral supernatants by growing the stable packaging cells to near confluency, then harvesting the supernatant each morning, evening and morning for three harvests.",
    "Filter the viral supernatants and either directly use or divide them into 1 ml aliquots and store at -80 °C for later use. Note that viral supernatant loses 50% infection efficiency with each freeze-thaw. Remember to bleach-wash before discarding everything that has touched the viral particles.\n\tNOTE: The stable PA317 virus-producing cell line can be frozen and maintained at -150 °C for permanent storage (freezing medium is 10% DMSO; 90% Serum).\nPlate FACS-purified myogenic cells (described in steps 1.1-1.9) at a density of 5 x 104 cells/well in 6-well plates coated with 0.1% gelatin. Ensure that cells are attached to the plate before proceeding with the viral infection.\nAdd 400 μl filtered, freshly produced viral supernatant or frozen aliquots to each six-well plate overnight (keep 2 wells as controls).\nChange medium by feeding cells with 2.5 ml/well of fresh muscle media (4:1 Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and Medium 199 supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum; 0.02 M HEPES buffer; 1.4 mg/L vitamin B12; 0.03 mg/L ZnSO4, 0.055 mg/L dexamethasone, 2.5 μg/l hepatocyte growth factor and 10 μg/L basic fibroblast growth factor). Discard the media and pipettes containing the viral particles in a bleach container. Leave cells in the same medium for 3 days to recover from infection, then treat for selection using either 400 μg/ml neomycin (CDK4 infection) or 300 μg/ml hygromycin (hTERT infection).\nMaintain cells under drug selection until the cells in the control dish die (1-2 weeks).",
    "Passage cells before they become confluent (60-80% confluency; using 0.05% trypsin EDTA), even during the selection period. Replate cells in multiple 10cm dishes with fresh myoblast medium (as described in 2.11) supplemented with the selection drug. Maintain immortalized selected cells as a heterogeneous population or clone to obtain a completely homogeneous genetic background (same insertion of the transgene in every cell).\nPerform clonal selection using the following steps:\n\t\nSeed the cells at low density (e.g. 300 to 500 cells in 10 cm dishes) and maintain them for approximately two weeks, until small colonies are formed (10-20 cells).\nRemove most of the medium at this point, leaving only a thin film to prevent the cells from drying out.\nPlace a cloning ring (with one end dipped in silicone vacuum grease) over each desired clone and add a few drops of trypsin/EDTA.\nHarvest cells once they become rounded by carefully aspirating the cells using a 1 ml tip or a Pasteur pipet and transferring them to the smallest available multiwell plate (96 or 48, 24 or 12 well plates).\nExpand clones as needed to prevent local confluency.\nSubscription Required.
