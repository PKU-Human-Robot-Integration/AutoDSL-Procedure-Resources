    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNormalization by SYBR green labeling\nTiming: 20 min\nThe SYBR Green assay that we describe here allows to quickly determine, before the experiment and regardless of plaque formation capacities, the number of B. bacteriovorus present in different cultures. This allows sample normalization for the comparison of predation dynamics (predator proliferation and/or prey killing).\nCritical: The cleared culture must be checked by microscopy prior to the SYBR Green assay to verify the status of the predators. They should be actively swimming and there should be almost no prey or bdelloplast left (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nStart an overnight culture from a double layer plate (before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 7) or from a revived clone (before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 8).\nTurn on the plate reader and prepare the protocol on the plate reader controlling software as follows:\nPre-set temperature: 25°C.\nContinuous shaking (double orbital shaking, frequency 282 cpm, 15 min).\nSYBR Green fluorescence read: 490 nm excitation, 520 nm emission, gain set with the Standard DNA curve (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 10).\nAbsorbance read at 600 nm (OD 600).\nFor each cleared culture, prepare replicates by transferring 198 μL into 3 different wells of a black 96-well plate with transparent flat bottom.\nWith gloves and protected from light, add 2 μL of SYBR Green from the pre-diluted stock (1:30, see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 9).\nQuickly load the plate without lid inside the plate reader.",
    "For each culture, calculate the average SYBR Green fluorescence value due to Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus by subtracting from the average total SYBR Green fluorescence value the average SYBR Green fluorescence value due to E. coli (determined from the OD measures and the prey standard curve, see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 11). Using the predator standard curve (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], step 12), the number of B. bacteriovorus cells can be extrapolated for each condition.\nNote: When the standard deviation of SYBR Green fluorescence represents more than 15% of the mean from the triplicate wells, exclude the outlier to calculate the mean.\nPrey killing and predator proliferation assay\nTiming: 18 h\nQuantification of predatory parameters is achieved upon an automated killing assay procedure, which allows live monitoring of both prey decay and predator proliferation, using absorbance and fluorescence measurements, respectively. Drugs or other chemicals, as well as mutations in either the prey or the predator, can be included to test their effect on these two aspects of predation.\nFollowing the SYBR Green assay, the killing kinetics of the Bdellovibrio predator is tested using a killing assay in a 96-well plate. The use of the mCh Bdellovibrio strain in which the mCherry fluorescent protein is produced constitutively, allows for monitoring of predator growth over time. Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], set the plate reader protocol for the killing assay as follows:\nTemperature: 30°C\nContinuous shaking (double orbital shaking, frequency 282 cpm).\nAbsorbance read at 600 nm (OD600)\nmCherry fluorescence read: 587 nm excitation, 610 nm emission, gain 70.\nNote: Since the fluorescence values might differ between plate readers, the gain should be optimized in your setup as explained in the “before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section, step 10.\nIntervals between acquisitions: 20 min\nTotal kinetics duration: 18 h",
    "Once the plate reader is set, prepare a black 96-well plate with transparent flat bottom by adding first the medium, i.e., DNB supplemented with 2 mM CaCl2 and 3 mM MgCl2, then the prey suspension (final OD600 = 1), and finally the B. bacteriovorus predator. We recommend a concentration of 5-10 × 107 cells/mL, which corresponds to approximately 20–40 μL of a clear lysate at 6000 units obtained in the SYBR Green assay (“before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]” section, step 12). The recommended final volume is 300 μL per well.\nCritical: When killing kinetics of several B. bacteriovorus strains are compared, the volume of B. bacteriovorus inoculum must be adjusted according to the results in the SYBR Green assay in order to engage the same initial amount of predators.\nNote: For this step, we recommend using repetitive pipettes to ensure accurate liquid transfer and reproducibility over technical and biological replicates.\nNote: If antibiotics are used in the experiment, the prey must carry the same resistance as the predator. From our experience, B. bacteriovorus strains carrying replicative plasmids do not lose their plasmid when selective antibiotics have been removed for the last overnight culture only. In order to avoid any possible impact of the selective pressure on the comparison of predation efficiencies between strains carrying plasmids with different antibiotics resistance cassettes and/or strains without replicative plasmid, we usually subculture the antibiotics-resistant B. bacteriovorus, from a starter culture containing the antibiotics, in medium without antibiotics before the killing assay. In this case, a wild-type E. coli strain can be used as prey for both the subculture and the assay.\nIn addition to the predatory mix in 7., a couple of controls must be added in the same 96-well plate:",
    "the prey alone in DNB supplemented with salts to both monitor the predation-independent lysis occurring during the experiment, and as a blank for data normalization.\nthe Bdellovibrio predator alone to monitor the fluorescence signal in absence of prey.\nCritical: In these control wells, keep the same density of predator or prey cells as used in the predatory mix in a 300 μL final volume.\nQuickly load the 96-well plate without lid in the plate reader and start the killing kinetics for 18 h using the settings described in 7.

    "Classify replicates into conditions and blanks. If the experiment includes different conditions and blanks, simply drag and drop each replicate and the corresponding blanks using the provided interface.\nSelect data range. In some cases, not all time points should be fitted to a sigmoid curve, e.g., when bacteria start dying after the exponential phase. Only the portion of the data that are following the shape of a sigmoid curve should be selected.\nSelect the model (currently only “Richard\" is available), the loss function (how close the model parameters are from the data: Least Absolute Deviation (LAD) or Ordinary Least Square (OLS)) and the optimization method (how to optimize the parameters to minimize the loss function: currently only Genetic Algorithm (GA)), then press fit.\nParameters obtained with the “Richard\" model are extracted from this modification of the generalized logistic equation:\n  P  ( t )  =   P  m i n    +     P  m a x   −   P  m i n     1  +   e   4 ×  r  m a x     t − s       \nwhere   P  ( t )   : Population at time t (number of cells, OD600 or fluorescence unit),    P  m i n    : Minimal population, lower asymptote (number of cells, OD600 or fluorescence unit),    P  m a x    : Maximal population, upper asymptote (number of cells, OD600 or fluorescence unit),    r  m a x    : Maximum rate, when   t = s  , positive if the population grows (i.e., growth rate), negative if the population declines (i.e., killing rate) (number of cells, OD600 or fluorescence unit),   s  : Inflexion point, time when the rate (i.e., the value of the derivative of the curve) is an extremum (hours, h), e.g., if   s   is equal to 4,    r  m a x     is reached at 4 h.",
    "Multiple metrics regarding the goodness of fit are provided as well as a dataframe containing the raw, the fitted data and the model parameters. The two easiest metrics to check are the variance explained (VEcv) and Willmott et al.’s refined index of agreement (dr) (formulas for the metrics are available in Li (2017)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] and implementation of these are available in the CuRveR source code). These two metrics range from 0 (bad fit) to 100 (perfect fit). Troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: Parameters are extracted on a condition-basis (where technical replicates are pooled for each condition) rather than on a well-basis. This results in a higher precision, especially when there are substantial differences between replicates or experiments. Precision is indeed proportional to the square root of the number of degrees of freedom, which is higher when replicates are pooled than when taken individually\nPlot your data. Several options are available (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B)."
