    "1. Protein purification\nPrepare buffers A–H, as seen in Table 1.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4,5,6\nBuffer solution,Buffering agent (all 20 mM),pH,NaCl (mM),imidazole (mM),MgCl2,TCEP\nA,HEPES,7.3,300,-,5,1\nB,HEPES,7.3,300,35,5,1\nC,HEPES,7.3,300,500,5,1\nD,MES,6.0,200,-,5,1\nE,MES,6.0,-,-,5,1\nF,MES,6.0,100,-,5,1\nG,MES,6.0,1000,-,5,1\nH,HEPES,7.3,300,-,1,1\nPrepare the purification materials (see Table of Materials): protease inhibitor cocktail without EDTA or other chelators; immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) column; cation exchange chromatography (CEX) column; 0.45 μm syringe filter; 2 M imidazole (pH = 7.5); ultracentrifuge capable of 100,000 x g; high speed benchtop centrifuge capable of 4,000 x g; centrifugal filter units (10 KDa NMWL); spectrophotometer capable of reading at 280 nm; His6-tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease; and chromatography instrumentation capable of mixing two buffer solutions, applying solutions to columns, creating gradient elutions from column, and collecting fractions from columns.\nThaw cells from ~2 L of insect cell culture previously stored at -80 °C or use freshly harvested cells. See Gillette et al. 201915 for details about the Tni.FNL insect cell line and expression protocols. Carefully resuspend the cells with 200 mL of Buffer A with added 1:200 v/v protease inhibitor without introducing air or creating foam.\n\tNOTE: Step 1.3 and subsequent steps (except as noted) should be performed at room temperature (~22 °C). It is important that the sample be homogeneous to allow complete lysis in the next step.\nLyse cell pellet in a microfluidizer at 7,000 psi for two passes or in an equivalent lysis system. Alternative methods of lysis have not been explored.",
    "Clarifying insect cell lysates is problematic due to the presence of compounds that clog filters. Thus, ultracentrifugation (100,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C) is very important. A white lipid residue on the surface of the supernatant should be avoided and can be removed or reduced using cotton swabs. Filter the decanted supernatant through a 0.45 μm PES filter. Use the clarified sample immediately or store at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: The residue blocks filters quickly and many filters may be necessary. Failure to reduce the amount of this material will lead to high column back pressure in subsequent steps.\nDetermine the volume of the clarified lysate and adjust the sample to 35 mM imidazole by the addition of 2 M imidazole stock. Load the sample at 3 mL/min onto a 20 mL IMAC column (HisPrep FF 16/10 column) pre-equilibrated in Buffer B for three column volumes (CVs).\nAlthough the target protein is typically quantitatively adsorbed to the column, it is best to collect the column flow for subsequent analysis. Wash the column until the Abs280 reaches a steady baseline (<100 milliabsorbance units [mAU]) with Buffer B at 3 mL/min for 20 mL (1 CV) then for ~3 CV at 4 mL/min for the remainder of the wash step. Typically, 60–80 mL of Buffer B is needed to achieve baseline absorbance.\nElute the protein with a 400 mL (20 CV) gradient from Buffer B to Buffer C while collecting 8 mL fractions. Typically, the target protein elutes in the first half of the gradient (Figure 1A; not all later fractions are shown).\nAnalyze protein fractions using SDS-PAGE/Coomassie staining. Pool peak fractions and dialyze the pool overnight against 2 L of Buffer D at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: Low pH is critical to ensure protein binding in the next step. However, the pH change during this dialysis occurs slowly, and this is a convenient step for overnight incubation. Alternative buffer exchange strategies (e.g., higher buffer concentration to speed the pH change) have not been investigated. The protein will begin to slowly precipitate over time at lower pH and lower salt concentrations and a small amount of precipitation is normal during this step. Because of this, we avoid exchanging the buffer to the 100 mM NaCl necessary for binding to the next column during dialysis. Rather, an NaCl concentration of 200 mM is used for dialysis and the protein is diluted to 100 mM (see below) immediately prior to application to the column. We have not investigated if this precipitation is specific to KRAS4b, but the protein that does precipitate has been confirmed as KRAS4b-FMe. For this reason, we suggest using the higher NaCl concentration in the dialysis buffer for any protein of interest as a precaution until the stability of the target protein in the binding buffer can be determined.\nRemove the sample from dialysis and centrifuge at 4,000 x g for 10 min to remove any precipitate. The final dialyzed, clarified sample at this point is still often hazy but can be applied without further processing onto the subsequent CEX column.\nPrepare a 20 mL cation exchange column (see Table of Materials) by washing with three CVs of Buffer G, then with three CVs of Buffer F.\n\tNOTE: While we have not meticulously evaluated other resins, several colleagues have found poor resolution with resins other than SP Sepharose High Performance resin.",
    "Dilute 20 mL of the dialyzed sample to a final NaCl concentration of 100 mM by adding 20 mL of Buffer E and apply the diluted sample to the cation exchange column.\nContinue to load the column by adding freshly diluted samples prepared as described above to the load tube as the previous dilution is nearing the end of the load.\n\tNOTE: Diluting the entire sample at once to 100 mM NaCl has resulted in significant loss of target protein due to precipitation.\nWash the column to baseline Abs280 with Buffer F. This typically requires 3 CV. The protein is eluted from the column during a 400 mL (20 CV) gradient from Buffer F to 65% Buffer G, collected in 6 mL fractions (Figure 1B).\nContinue washing the column for an additional 1.5 CV (65% Buffer G) once the gradient is completed. Choose positive fractions based on both SDS-PAGE/Coomassie blue stain analysis and inspection of the UV trace of the chromatogram.",
    "NOTE: The UV trace typically contains five peaks. Beginning at lower salt concentrations, the initial peak is usually unprocessed and/or proteolyzed protein. The second and third peaks are a mixture of two forms of processed protein: the second peak is primarily a farnesylated intermediate (FARN), while the third is primarily the fully processed FMe protein of interest. Peaks four and five represent His6-MBP-KRAS4b fusion proteins (all of the protein is in this format at this point, as no TEV digestion has occurred). These are not N-acetylated at the N-terminus and are farnesylated (peak four) and farnesylated and carboxymethylated (peak five) at the C-terminus. As peak two and peak four will produce identical proteins after tag removal (i.e., KRAS4b-FARN) these can be pooled at this stage if desired. Similarly, peak three and peak five can be combined to produce a single lot of KRAS4b-FMe (Figure 1B, Figure 2). However, it is advised that this pooling only be done when the nature of the protein in the separate peaks has been confirmed.\nDigest the protein pooled in step 1.15 with His6-TEV protease (~200 μg of protease/mL of sample.\n\tNOTE: We make His6-TEV protease using the plasmid and protocols available from Addgene (https://www.addgene.org/92414[href=https://www.addgene.org/92414]). Dialyze the TEV digest against Buffer A (10 kDa MWCO dialysis tubing with a minimum of 40 mL of Buffer A per mL of sample) for 2 h at room temperature and then overnight at 4 °C.\nAfter digestion and dialysis, load the protein directly to a 20 mL IMAC column equilibrated with Buffer A at 3 mL/min.",
    "NOTE: Collect 7 mL fractions during this entire chromatography, because the target protein has a low affinity for the column but might not be entirely bound to the resin. Wash the column at 3 mL/min with Buffer A for a total of 3 CVs or until a baseline absorbance is reached.\nThe target protein is eluted with a 5 CV gradient of Buffer C from 0%–10%, collecting 7 mL fractions. As a precaution, additional bound proteins can be eluted with 100% Buffer C. Positive fractions are identified after analysis by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1C). Typically, the target protein elutes at a low imidazole concentration (i.e., in the 0%–10% Buffer C gradient) but sometimes elutes in the flow-through or column wash.\nDialyze the final pool against Buffer H. Determine the protein concentration by spectrophotometry at 280 nm.\n\tNOTE: Be sure to account for the presence of the nucleotide when determining the extinction coefficient to use for this calculation.\nThe protein can be concentrated to ~2–5 mg/mL using a centrifugal filter unit (10 K NMWL) without significant protein loss. Filter with a 0.22 μM syringe filter. Measure the solution absorbance at A280 to calculate the final protein concentration (Figure 1D). Snap freeze aliquots in liquid nitrogen and store frozen samples at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: The protein purified is bound to GDP. KRAS4b-FMe can be exchanged into GppNHp using previously published protocols16.\n2. Sample preparation for intact mass analysis and native mass analysis\nSample preparation for intact mass analysis",
    "Thaw protein sample on ice prior to analysis. For intact mass analysis, dilute the protein to 0.1 mg/mL in 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH = ~8.4). For native mass analysis, dilute the protein to a concentration of 0.1 mg/mL in 50 mM ammonium acetate (pH = ~7.5). Vortex each sample for 5–10 s, then centrifuge at 12,500 x g for 1 min to pellet any solid material in the solution. Remove 10–20 µL of each supernatant and transfer to a glass autosampler vial. Cap each vial tightly to prevent contamination or evaporation.\n\t\tNOTE: For either intact mass analysis or native mass analysis, the sample may be desalted prior to analysis using a 10 kDa MWCO cellulose membrane filter to buffer-exchange into the final dilution buffer.\nPreparation of the extended mass range (EMR) mass spectroscopy for mass analysis\n\tNOTE: Prior to running any analysis on the mass spectrometer, make sure that it has been recently calibrated. Also, always wear gloves and other personal protective equipment as necessary to avoid any harmful chemicals and to avoid contaminating samples and solvents. Calibration is done using a calibration solution obtained commercially and a 2 mg/mL cesium iodide solution prepared in-house.\n\t\nOpen the analysis software and load the appropriate instrument method file. For intact mass analysis of KRAS4b proteins, suitable starting parameters are as follows: positive mode of detection; three microscans, resolution = 70,000; AGC target = 3e6; maximum integration time = 200 ms; and a scan range = 70–1,800 mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). For native mass analysis of KRAS4b proteins, suitable starting parameters are as follows: positive mode of detection; 10 microscans, resolution = 17,500; in-source collision-induced dissociation (CID) = 20 eV; AGC target = 3e6; collision energy (CE) = 20; maximum integration time = 200 ms; and a scan range = 500–10,000 m/z.",
    "Preparation of chromatographic solvents and column\n\t\nPrepare the solvents necessary for intact mass analysis. Solvent A is water with 0.1% formic acid. Solvent B is 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water.\nPrepare the solvents necessary for native mass analysis. Solvent A is 0.1 M ammonium acetate in water and Solvent B is water.\nAfter the appropriate solvents are prepared, purge the system so that the tubing is filled with the appropriate solvents and all air bubbles are removed from the lines.\nInstall the appropriate column (a reverse-phase column for intact mass analysis and a size exclusion column for native mass analysis). For intact mass analysis, the flow rate is 0.5 mL/min, and the column temperature (using a column heater) is 50 °C. Equilibrate the column for 15–20 min. For native mass analysis, the flow rate is 0.25 mL/min.\n\t\tNOTE: Always monitor the column back-pressure to ensure that it does not rise above the upper limit, which could indicate a clogged line or that the column matrix is compromised. Replace the column if necessary.\nSample analysis\n\t\nPlace the prepared protein sample in the glass autosampler vial into the appropriate vial rack in the LC systems autosampler. Create a sample(s) list in the software program with the appropriate instrument method for the desired analysis. Once the sample list is complete, click the Play button to start the analysis.\nInject 1–2 μL of sample per analysis, with a water blank before and after each sample, to ensure no carry-over is present.",
    "NOTE: The intact mass analysis is very different than the native mass analysis and requires very different instrument method settings. This is because with the intact mass analysis, the protein is \"relaxed\" in the presence of an organic solvent, and thus is capable of accepting more charges. It is easier to deconvolute and resolve the isotopic distribution of the charge states. Native mass analysis provides a narrow charge distribution of the protein ions, and based on the protein, requires different voltage and collision energy settings.\nData analysis and protein deconvolution\n\t\nExport the spectrum of the sample to software where it can be transformed to the de-convoluted spectrum that will display the intact mass (or native mass) of the protein. The intact mass will have an isotopic peak distribution due to the high abundance of charged spectral peaks. The native mass will typically have very few peaks due to the low abundance of the charged spectral peaks (Figure 3D).\nExpand the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) range of the peak d to confirm that the measured mass is consistent with the predicted mass. Occasionally, due to the addition of charges to the protein, there may be a slight variation between the expected molecular weight (MW) and the observed MW. Also, as with many mass spectrometry analyses, adducts such as sodium can contribute to the appearance of additional peaks in the data, even with carefully desalted samples. Lower abundant peaks with an m/z that is lower than expected are sometimes observed. This is most likely due to a neutral loss, which is the loss of a functional group due to the ionization process.",
    "NOTE: As expected, there will be differences between the intact mass and the native mass peaks. The intact mass display will show the protein's expected MW. It will not have the extra MW of the attached nucleotide or other modifications. However, the native mass peak will show the protein with any added nucleotide.\n3. Validation of KRAS4b-FMe binding to liposomes\nMembrane liposomes preparation\n\t\nPrepare a buffer consisting of 20 mM HEPES (pH = 7.3), 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM TCEP.\nLiposome preparation materials include 25 mM 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) and 10 mM 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (POPS) stocks in chloroform; a lipid extruder set with a holder and heating block; argon gas and liquid nitrogen; an ultrasonic bath; glass screw thread vials with PTFE foam liners; and a plate reader capable of dynamic light scattering detection.\nThaw lipid stocks in chloroform at room temperature for 30 min. Prepare 1 mL of 5 mM 70:30 POPC: POPS liposomes by aliquoting 106 μL of 25 mM POPC (stock) and 118 μL of 10 mM POPS (stock) into a glass vial.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not aliquot lipids with a plastic tip, because the chloroform could dissolve certain plastic tips.\nDry lipids under a steady stream of argon gas. Slowly rotate the glass vial when applying the argon gas to form a thin layer of dry film.\nPut samples under a vacuum lyophilizer overnight to remove excess chloroform.\nReconstitute the lipids by adding 1 mL of buffer to the dried film and vortex the mixtures for 5 min. Hydrate the lipid mixtures by rocking for 1 h at 25 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The sample will be very turbid upon addition of the buffer to the dried film layer of lipids.",
    "Perform five freeze/thaw cycles by alternating placing the sample vial between an ice-water (4 °C or lower) and a warm water bath (25 °C or higher).\nPlace the sample vial into the ultrasonic bath and sonicate the sample for about 0.5 h or until the sample becomes semitransparent.\nExtrude the samples using the lipid extruder set. Assemble the extrusion kit as shown in the manufacturer's instructions. Extrude the samples using 0.1 μm filter paper. Load the samples into one glass syringe and attach it to one end of the extrusion apparatus. Add an empty syringe on the other end of the extrusion apparatus. Push back and forth 10–20x until your samples become fully transparent.\nSpin the final samples for 30 min at 20,000 x g to remove any large aggregates.\nUse dynamic light scattering (DLS) to determine the size and homogeneity of the liposomes (optional). Place 30 μL of the liposomes into a 384 well plate reader. Spin the plate at 1,000 x g for 30 min. Place the plate into a plate reader and collect 10 light scattering measurements.\nCharactering KRAS4b-FMe binding to liposomes via surface plasmon resonance (SPR)\n\t\nAssemble the required materials: an SPR instrument; sensor chip L1; 7 x 14 mm vial tubes; and CHAPS.\nPrepare a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES (pH = 7.3), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP. Prepare a 2:1 dilution series of KRAS4b-FMe from 60 μM–0.06 μM in a total volume of 200 μL (10 titrations total). Transfer the final diluted samples into vial tubes (see Table of Materials), place the vial tubes into a rack, and insert the samples into the SPR instrument.\nInsert the L1 sensor chip into the SPR instrument. Attach the buffer and prime the system with buffer for 7 min.\nSet up an automated method as follows:",
    "Set the instrument temperature to 25 °C.\nActivate the sensor chip L1 by rinsing it with two 1 min injections of 20 mM CHAPS dissolved in water at 30 μL/min flow rate.\nPerform start-up cycles of ten 1 min injections of running buffer to hydrate the chip surface.\n\t\t\t\nDeposit the liposomes onto the sensor chip L1 by injecting the liposomes onto the flow cell (FC)-2 of the L1 chip with 2 min injections at 5 μL/min. Aim for a capture level of at least ~3,000 response units (RUs).\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Increase the injection time until you achieve the appropriate capture level.\nInject three cycles of buffer over both FC-1 and FC-2 with 1 min injections at 30 μL/min.\n\t\t\t\nInject the various KRAS4b-FMe titrations from the lowest to the highest concentration series. Inject the proteins using 1 min injections for the association phase and 2 min injections for the dissociation phase at 30 μL/min flow rate over both FCs.\nRegenerate the sensor chip L1 by rinsing it with two 1 min injections of 20 mM CHAPS at 30 μL/min.\nFit the data using the SPR evaluation software using a single site binding model to obtain apparent binding affinities (see the Discussion section for an explanation of data fitting).\nSubscription Required.
