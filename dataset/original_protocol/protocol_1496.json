    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nIsolate and culture primary mouse cortical neurons\nTiming: 4–6 days\nPrimary neurons are isolated from brains of embryonic C57BL/6 mice and grown in preparation for co-culturing with microglia. Here, we propose to isolate and grow neurons from embryos as it is difficult to isolate viable neurons from adult mice for large scale experiments. On average each pregnant C57BL/6 mouse carries 6 embryos, if additional cells are needed; CD-1 mice may be considered as they have a higher average litter size of 10.\nCoat T25 tissue culture flasks with 5 mL of 10 μg/mL poly-L-ornithine (PO) dissolved in sterile distilled water for at least 30 min (preferably more than 8 h) at 22°C–24°C. Remove the PO solution and wash with sterile distilled water.\nFor downstream assay, coat 96-well flat bottom black/clear plates (Falcon 353219) with PO solution. This may also be used for immediate culturing of neurons.\nPrepare the following:\nPrepare and prewarm the growth medium containing Neurobasal Plus medium (Gibco) and 1X B27 Plus Supplement (Gibco) at 37°C.\nNote: Prepare this fresh before use.\nOn a hot plate, prewarm ∼ 300 mL of water in a 1 L beaker to 35°C–38°C.\nDisinfect instruments with 70% ethanol: dissection scissors, forceps, iridectomy scissors, ultra-fine point forceps, and scalpel.\nAutoclaved 100 mL bottles and Buchner funnel with nylon mesh at 130 μm pore size.\nAcquire cortical neurons from mouse embryos at gestation days 14–16.\nEuthanize pregnant mouse with ketamine (100 mg/mg)/xylazine (10 mg/kg) overdose via intraperitoneal injection.\nLay the anesthetized mouse on its back; disinfect the abdominal area with 70% ethanol. Lift the skin of the lower abdomen and make a V-shaped incision with scissors.",
    "Disinfect the instruments with 70% ethanol once more. Then lift the uterine horns containing the embryos, dissect them out of the abdominal cavity, and place them in a sterile 10-cm petri dish containing calcium and magnesium-free Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (CMF-HBSS).\nIn a biosafety cabinet, dissect the uterine horns to release the embryos from their individual sacs.\nUse iridectomy scissors to cut around the base of the head of each embryo, such that the skin can be lifted to reveal the brain. Carefully scoop out the brain into a new sterile 10-cm petri dish containing 20 mL CMF-HBSS.\nRemove the meninges from the brains using a dissection microscope, separate the cerebral hemispheres and place them in a new sterile 10-cm petri dish containing 3–5 mL of CMF-HBSS.\nDice the cerebral hemispheres with a sterile scalpel into fragments of < 1 mm and form a tissue suspension by adding 10–15 mL of CMF-HBSS. Drop a stir-bar into an autoclaved 100 mL bottle, then transfer the tissue suspension into the bottle with a sterile pipette. Note the volume transferred.\nAdd sterile trypsin to the tissue suspension to a final concentration of 0.025% (from 2.5% stock solution, Gibco). Immerse the 100 mL bottle containing the tissue suspension in the prewarmed water bath at 35°C–38°C, set the stirring speed to low medium, and homogenize the tissue for 15 min at 35°C–38°C.\nAdd 1 mL of sterile heat inactivated FBS to the homogenized suspension to inactivate the trypsin, then pour the suspension through the Buchner filter funnel with nylon mesh into a new autoclaved 100 mL bottle. Using the plunger of a 3 mL syringe, gently grind the tissue on the nylon mesh and wash it through the filter with CMF-HBSS.\nNote: Alternatively, a sterile 100 μm cell strainer may be used to filter cells.",
    "Transfer the filtered tissue suspension to 50 mL tubes and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 22°C–24°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellets in CMF-HBSS, pooling all the cell suspensions in one 50 mL tube, then top up with CMF-HBSS to 50mL, and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 22°C–24°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 5–10 mL of prewarmed growth medium, then count cells with trypan blue for culturing.\nCritical: Gently handle neuronal cells after dissociation from the brain as these cells are highly sensitive to stress and damage. Do not vortex or vigorously triturate.\nCulture neurons in preparation for microglia co-culture.\nSeed 20 × 106 cells isolated from step 3 per PO-coated T25 flask from step 1 in 5 mL of growth medium. Incubate cells at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.\nAfter 2–3 days, healthy neurons have grown processes and can be harvested for experimental use.\nAdd trypsin to the neuron culture to a final concentration of 0.25%. Incubate at 37°C for ∼ 5 min to dislodge the neurons, then add 0.5 mL of sterile heat inactivated FBS.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL tube, centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 22°C–24°C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend in 5 mL of prewarmed growth medium.\nCount cells with trypan blue and seed the neurons into PO coated 96-well flat bottom black/clear plates from step 1 at 0.75–1 × 105 cells per well in 100 μL of growth medium.\nAfter 24–48 h, Neurons with healthy process formation in 96-well plates can be co-cultured with microglia (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nAlternatively, if under time constraint, neurons isolated in step 3 may be directly seeded onto PO coated 96-well plates for use.",
    "Note: This will result in greater amounts of debris in the neuron culture.\nIsolate microglia from the adult mouse brain\nTiming: 5 h\nPrimary microglia isolated from the brains of 6–12 weeks old C57BL/6 mice will be cocultured with embryonic neurons. We propose the use of adult brain derived microglia to better model in vivo microglia; alternatively, microglia may be enriched from mixed glia cultures generated from the brains of neonatal mice. These steps are in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocols for the EasySep™ Mouse CD11b Positive Selection Kit II from STEMCELL Technologies (https://cdn.stemcell.com/media/files/pis/10000003693-PIS_01.pdf[href=https://cdn.stemcell.com/media/files/pis/10000003693-PIS_01.pdf]).\nNote: We have also used this protocol to isolate microglia from the brains of 52-week-old mice.\nPrepare the following:\nSample preparation medium of CMF-HBSS containing 2% FBS and 1 mM EDTA.\nPrewarm brain digestion medium containing CMF-HBSS with 20 units/mL of Papain (Worthington) and 100 μg/mL DNase I to 22°C–24°C.\nNote: Prepare 3 mL brain digestion medium for up to 3 brains. For 4 or more brains, prepare 1 mL brain digestion medium per brain.\n100% isotonic Percoll solution by combining 9 parts of Percoll (Sigma) with 1-part of 10X D-PBS (37354, STEMCELL Technologies).\nCombine 3 parts of 100% isotonic Percoll with 7 of parts sample preparation medium to make 6 mL of 30% Percoll solution per brain.\nDisinfect dissection tools with 70% ethanol: dissection scissors, forceps, iridectomy scissors, small dissecting spatula, scalpel.\nHarvest brains from mice.\nEuthanize mice with ketamine (100 mg/kg) /xylazine (10 mg/kg) overdose via intraperitoneal injection.\nIn a biosafety cabinet, disinfect mouse with 70% ethanol, then decapitate it using dissection scissors.\nUse iridectomy scissors to cut alone the top of the skull, and in parallel on both sides.\nUse forceps to peel away the skin and top the skull, then use the dissecting spatula to scoop out the brain.",
    "Place the brain in a sterile petri dish containing 1 mL of brain digestion medium.\nIsolate single cell suspension from brains. All centrifugation steps can be performed at 22°C–24°C or 4°C.\nIn a biosafety cabinet, mince the brains with a scalpel into small pieces < 1 mm.\nTransfer the minced brain tissue into a 50 mL tube, then rinse the petri dish with the remaining brain digestion medium and add this to the cell suspension in the 50 mL tube.\nIncubate the cell suspension at 37°C for 30 min while continuous shaking or rotating at medium low speed so the minced brain tissues remain dispersed in the digestion medium.\nFilter the digested brain tissue through a 70 μm nylon mesh strainer using the rubber end of a syringe plunger, then rinse the strainer with sample preparation medium.\nNote: New strainers may be used if necessary.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min with low brakes. Then carefully remove and discard the supernatant with a serological pipette.\nAdd 30% Percoll prepared in step 5d to the cell pellet.\nNote: Use one or multiple 15 mL tubes for volume < 30 mL.\nCentrifuge at 700 × g for 10 min with no brakes.\nUse a 2 mL serological pipette and carefully remove the upper myelin layer, then carefully discard the remaining supernatant.\nTransfer cells to a new tube and top up with sample preparation medium. Centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min with low brakes.\nDiscard the supernatants, then count with trypan blue and resuspend cells at 2.5 × 107 cells/mL in PBS containing 2% FBS and 1 mM EDTA.\nEnrich for CD11b+ microglia from cells isolated from brains using the EasySep™ Mouse CD11b Positive Selection Kit II (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).",
    "Perform steps in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol, using the EasySepTM magnet.\nResuspend enriched cells in neuron growth medium and count with trypan blue.\nNote: Expect 1–2 × 106 cells from 3 brains.\nAdd microglia to neurons cultured in 96-well plates from step 4.\n2.5 × 104 microglia resuspended in 100 μL of neuron growth medium are added to each well containing 0.75–1 × 105 neurons.\nNeurons with microglia are now cocultured in a total volume of 200 μL of neuron growth medium.\nCocultured microglia and neurons are used for experiments after 24 or 48 h.\nNote: Prepare 3–4 technical replicate wells per experimental condition as required.\nAssess microglia function and OxPC-mediated neurotoxicity in the microglia neuron coculture\nTiming: 3 days\nCocultured microglia and neurons are treated with OxPC and/or other modulators of microglia to assess the effect of microglia on neuron survival in the context of OxPC mediated neurodegeneration. In addition, this coculturing method may also be adapted to test the neuroprotection or neurotoxic potential of other molecules.\nEnsure microglia and neurons have been in coculture for at least 24 h.\nInclude neurons alone, and untreated microglia and neurons as control conditions.\nAdd purified OxPCs (i.e., POVPC or PAzePC or other toxins) to the cells at desired concentrations (troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nNeurons and microglia are cocultured in 200 μL of neuron growth medium, in 96-well plates.\nCarefully remove 100 μL of the media while ensuring the tip of the pipette is to the edge of the well to minimize accidental removal of cells Then, add 100 μL of neural basal plus medium alone (no B27 plus supplement) containing 2X the concentration of OxPCs for a final 1:2 dilution.",
    "For example, for a final concentration of 50 μM of POVPC, add 100 μL of neural basal plus media containing 100 μM of POVPC to 100 μL of cells.\nInclude the appropriate negative controls:\nAdd equivalent volume of ethanol used to dissolve the OxPCs to neurons alone and neurons cocultured with microglia.\nAdd equivalent concentrations of DPPC as OxPCs to neurons alone and neuron cocultured with microglia.\nIncubate cells at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2.\nOptional: Adding cell viability dyes such as Calcein AM (Thermo Fisher) or propidium iodide (Thermo Fisher) at manufacturer’s recommended concentrations to OxPC treated neurons allows live tracking and imaging of neurotoxicity over time.\nOptional: Treat cells with or without modulators of interest as needed. For example, to test whether microglia phagocytosis is needed to protect neurons for OxPCs, first remove 100 μL of neuron growth medium (from a total of 200 μL) from cells. Then add 50 μL of neural basal medium containing 20 μM (4X concentration) of cytochalasin D (Sigma) or 800 nM (4X concentration) of latrunculin A (Thermo Fisher) to cells and incubate at 37°C for 30 min. Finally, add 50 μL of neural basal plus medium alone (no B27 plus supplement) containing 4X the concentration of OxPCs for a final 1:4 dilution.\nAfter 24 h, remove tissue culture supernatant and fix cells for immunochemistry and quantitative fluorescence microscopy.\nTissue culture supernatant may be collected and stored at −80°C for additional secretome analysis.\nTo fix cells, after the removal of the supernatant, add 100 μL of 4% PFA to cells and incubate for 10 min at 22°C–24°C.\nCarefully pipette to remove the PFA and wash twice with 100 μL of PBS.",
    "Note: Cells may be incubated with microglia and treatments for longer periods of time (i.e. 48 h) if needed.\nPause point: The fixed cells in 96-well plates may be sealed with parafilm and stored at 4°C for at least 2 weeks prior to staining and analysis.\nPermeabilize cells with 100 μL PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 10 min at 22°C–24°C.\nCarefully pipette to remove the supernatant and block cells by adding 100 μL of Odyssey Blocking Buffer (LI-COR) for 1 h at 22°C–24°C.\nRemove the blocking buffer and incubate with 70 μL of primary antibodies diluted in the blocking buffer for 8–12 h at 4°C with gentle shaking.\nUse mouse anti-tubulin β3 IgG (clone TUJ1, Biolegend) at 2 μg/mL to label neurons.\nUse rabbit anti-IBA1 IgG (polyclonal, Wako Fujifilm) at 0.5–0.7 μg/mL to label microglia.\nRemove the supernatant and wash 2X with 100 μL of PBS.\nIncubate with 70 μL of secondary antibodies and DAPI (Sigma) diluted in blocking buffer for 0.5–1 h at 22°C–24°C with gentle shaking.\nUse Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG and Alexa Fluor 647 donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at 1:400 from manufacturer’s recommended stock concentration.\nUse DAPI at 1 μg/mL.\nRemove the supernatant, wash 2X with 100 μL of PBS, and resuspend cells in 100 μL of PBS.\nNote: Neurons and microglia may be labeled with other primary and secondary antibodies of interest as needed for alternative analyses.\nPause point: The fixed and stained cells in 96-well plates may be sealed with parafilm and stored at 4°C for at least 2 weeks prior to analysis.\nImage cells and quantify neuron survival in coculture with or without microglia after OxPC treatments.",

Automated imaging platforms are recommended to conserve the experimentalist’s time.\nInduce OxPC-mediated neurodegeneration in the spinal cord white matter of microglia-sufficient and microglia-deficient mice\nTiming: 1–15 days\nPurified OxPCs are stereotaxically injected by surgery into the ventral spinal cord white matter of mice to induce demyelination and neurodegeneration. The needle injection site is in the ventral spinal cord white matter to minimize non-specific injury caused by the surgery, which may occur at varying severity in the dorsal white matter where the needle enters the spinal cord. The in vivo function of microglia responding to OxPCs may be assessed by injecting OxPCs into tamoxifen pre-treated CX3CR1CreER:Rosa26iDTR mice with or without diphtheria toxin (DT) injection. While this method describes the injection of OxPCs, other neurotoxins, cytokines, or demyelinating agents can be injected using these steps.\nDeplete microglia in tamoxifen pre-treated CX3CR1CreER:Rosa26iDTR mice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A) by intraperitoneal injection of 100 μL of PBS (microglia sufficient controls) or PBS containing 1 μg of DT (microglia deficient treatments).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1039-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Then, wash with ddH2O for 1 min and with 0.5% NH4OH for 5–10 sec, followed by 1 min of ddH2O. Then incubate tissues with 1% neutral red solution for 2 min and wash ddH2O water for 1 min. Dehydrate the tissues with successive 1 min washes of 50%, 70%, 90%, 95% and 100% ethanol, 2 min wash of isopropanol, 4 min of citrisolv, and mount the slide with coverslips using Acrytol mounting medium (Electron Microscopy Science). Use a brightfield microscope or slidescanner (i.e. 20× 0.75 NA air objective on the Olympus VS110 Slidescanner) to acquire images of serial spinal cord lesions. Using appropriate software such as ImageJ (NIH) or cellSens (Olympus), analyze demyelinated areas demarcated by lower eriochrome cyanine staining and higher neutral red staining in the ventral spinal cord white matter for lesion size and volume.\nThaw spinal cord tissue slides to 22°C–24°C and air dry (troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13]).\nWash and rehydrate by submerging tissues side in PBS for 10 min at 22°C–24°C.\nGently tap to dry the slides, place them flat on a staining apparatus and permeabilize the spinal cord sections by covering with 800 μL of PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 22°C–24°C.\nGently tap to dry the slides, cover the tissue sections with 800 μL of horse blocking solution (PBS, 10% horse serum, 1% BSA, 0.1% cold fish stain gelation, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.05% Tween-20) for 1 h at 22°C–24°C.",
    "Note: If using mouse-derived antibodies for staining, add rat anti-CD16/32 Fc blocking antibody (BD Biosciences) at 5 μg/mL to the blocking solution to minimize non-specific immune cell Fc receptor binding to mouse antibodies.\nWash the slides once by briefly submerging in PBS and gently tap dry.\nCover the tissue sections with 600 μL of primary antibodies resuspended in antibody dilution buffer (PBS, 1% BSA, 0.1% cold fish stain gelation, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 8–12 h at 4°C.\nNote: Ensure there is no overlap in the hosts of the primary antibodies. If the tissues were blocked with the rat anti-CD16/32 Fc blocking antibody, additional rat antibodies cannot be used. However, CD16/32 is a good marker for microglia/macrophage and monocytic cells in the spinal cord lesions. When staining tissues for the first time or with previously untested antibodies, isotype controls should be included to assess non-specific primary antibody binding.\nWash three times with PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20 for 5 min each at 22°C–24°C.\nCover the tissue sections with 600 μL of secondary antibodies and DAPI (1 μg/mL) resuspended in antibody dilution buffer for 1 h at 22°C–24°C.\nNote: A slide stained with only the secondary antibodies and DAPI should be included to assess non-specific secondary antibody binding.\nWash three times with PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20 for 5 min each at 22°C–24°C.\nMount slides with coverslips using Fluoromount-G solution (SouthernBiotech). Air dry slides at 22°C–24°C for ∼1 h.\nPause point: Stained slides may be stored in the dark at 4°C for at least 2 weeks priors to microscopy analysis.\nAcquire z-stacks of the lesion epicenters for each spinal cord/mouse using a laser confocal microscope with appropriate lasers and detectors needed for the labeled secondary antibodies and DAPI in step 45 (troubleshooting 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.15]).",
    "For our studies, we used a Leica TCS Sp8 laser confocal microscope with a 25X 0.5 NA water objective; 405 nm, 488 nm, 552 nm, and 640 nm excitation lasers; and two low dark current Hamamatsu PMT detectors as well as two high sensitivity hybrid detectors.\nImages were acquired in 8-bits, in a z-stack using uni-directional scanning, 1 times frame averaging, 1 airy unit pinhole, 0.75× zoom, and 0.57 μm per optical section and 2048 × 2048 pixels xy resolution.\nNote: 0.57 μm per optical section was selected as it is the z-resolution at Nyquist using the 25X 0.5 NA water objective on the Sp8. The xy resolution may be increased to Nyquist however the amount of time required to image each sample will drastically increase.\nSave all raw data in Tiffs and project files for analysis and record keeping.\nCritical: Equal acquisition setting state above as well as equal laser, gain, and offset settings must be applied for all samples within each set of experiments. To minimize variability, stain and image multiple slides at once."
