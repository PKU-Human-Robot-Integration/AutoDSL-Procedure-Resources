    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAssemble the treadmill system\nTiming: ∼2–3 days\nThe assembly of the treadmill system consists of three main steps: 1) assembling the treadmill, 2) assembling the magnetic rotary encoder interface, and 3) assembling the head-fixation apparatus.\nAssemble the treadmill.\nAffix the foam roller to the ball bearing blocks.\nPush the aluminum shaft through the pre-drilled center hole (Ø6 mm) in the foam roller and slide shaft collars and washers onto the shaft from each side.\nSlide the ball bearings onto the shaft and affix them within the ball-bearing blocks on each side of the foam roller by securing the ball bearings in place within the groove of the blocks.\nNote: The aluminum shaft should not be centered through the foam roller, rather 20 mm of shaft needs to extend on one side for the attachment of the magnetic rotary encoder.\nBuild base for the treadmill.\nPosition four post spacers on top of the large breadboard (width = 30 cm, length = 25 cm, thickness = 12.7 mm) and secure the dovetail translation stage on top using cap screws. Choose the position on the breadboard based on where you want the treadmill positioned.\nSecure the small breadboard (width = 15 cm, length = 10 cm, thickness = 12.7 mm) on top of the translation stage using cap screws and attach four optical posts (Ø12.7 mm) using set screws. Validate that the translation stage can move within the full XY range.\nNote: In case the small breadboard is not perfectly stable on the translation stage, four contact points of power tack adhesive can be added between the board and the stage.\nConnect the treadmill to the base.",
    "Slide the ball-bearing blocks onto the four optical posts and secure them with set screws. Make sure that the foam roller is level and rotates unhindered.\nPush the magnetic hub — from the magnetic rotary encoder kit (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) — onto the exposed end of the aluminum shaft and secure the base and encoder body using cap screws.\nAssemble the magnetic rotary encoder interface.\nJoin the rotary encoder interface circuit.\nNote: While not strictly required, we advise the researcher to perform this step with someone who has prior experience with assembling electrical wiring circuits, or alternatively, outsource this part to the local electrical workshop. For detailed schematics and photos on how to join the rotary encoder interface circuit see files available on GitHub: https://github.com/Neurune/TreadmillSystem[href=https://github.com/Neurune/TreadmillSystem].\nDrill two holes (Ø2.5 mm) in the 3D-printed plastic interface box, used for cutting M3 threads to hold the screws securing the box lid, according to the “Rotary encoder interface box.pdf” file.\nCut M3 threads in the two drilled holes using a M3 tap drill.\nTo protect the cables, fit rubber grommets to the two larger holes (Ø8.2) in the interface box, which will hold the rotary encoder connector cable and the coaxial cable.\nCut the rotary encoder connector cable and the coaxial cable to the desired length and pull them through the rubber grommets.\nAdd a piece of heat shrinking tube to the exposed wires of the rotary encoder connector cable and the coaxial cable.",
    "Solder the wires of the rotary encoder connector cable and the coaxial cable to the DC power connector plug according to the “Rotary encoder interface diagram.pdf” file. That is, for the rotary encoder connector cable: red wire (+5 V DC) soldered to the DC power socket pin 1 (pin A), black wire (ground) soldered to pin 2 (pin C), and green wire (analog output) soldered to the center core of the coaxial cable. For the coaxial cable, the braid (ground) is soldered to the DC power socket pin 2 (pin C).\nShrink the two pieces of heat shrinking tube and secure the cables inside the interface box using cable strips.\nClick the DC power socket into the recess in the interface box and secure the lid using two counter sunken nylon screws.\nNote: The length of the rotary encoder connector cable and the coaxial cable will depend on the geometry of the experimental setup (i.e., distance to the data acquisition device which samples the treadmill output). In our setup, the rotary encoder connector cable and the coaxial cable is 155 cm and 110 cm, respectively.\nConnect and test the rotary encoder interface.\nConnect the rotary encoder connector cable to the encoder body, the coaxial cable (with a BNC male plug) to the data acquisition device, and power the rotary encoder interface circuit with the 5 V power supply.\nTest that the rotary encoder is working by turning the treadmill at different speeds while visualizing the analog output voltage signal (0–5 V) on a PC or an oscilloscope. The encoder should sense absolute shaft position information over 360° of rotation with no stops or gaps.",
    "Critical: When connecting the rotary encoder to the data acquisition device, it is very important to configure the input port to be working in high-impedance mode; if the port is terminated with, for example, 50 Ohm the output signal of the rotary encoder will be severely distorted.\nAssemble the headplate-fixation apparatus.\nAffix headplate-fixation arms to breadboard.\nAttach four optical posts (each composed of two optical posts stacked; height = 15 cm and 10 cm, respectively, Ø25 mm) to the breadboard using set screws.\nScrew, from the bottom, small cap screws through the threads in the custom stainless steel headplate-fixation arms and secure these onto the optical posts by cap screws and washers using the extended groove.\nTest headplate fixation and adjust treadmill height.\nSlide the two small holes at the ends of the headplate down onto the cap screws and fit the headplate ends into the small groove on each of the arms.\nLock the headplate by either thumb nuts or hex nuts.\nNote: We prefer to use the thumb nuts for habituation sessions, as these are easy to maneuver and tighten by hand, and the hex nuts for experiments as these have a lower profile (an advantage for immersion objectives with short working distance) and can be tightened with a nut driver.\nAdjust the height of the treadmill relative to the headplate.\nNote: The optimal position will depend on the size of the mouse, but a starting point is to have 4 cm between the headplate and the top of the foam roller, when this is centered along the forward-backward axis relative to the circular opening of the headplate.\nHeadplate implantation\nTiming: ∼60 min",
    "Here, we describe how to surgically implant the headplate on the skull of the mouse for subsequent head fixation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Note that the position of the headplate on the skull dictates which brain regions can be studied (in this protocol, we implant above the primary visual cortex), and researchers should update the stereotaxic coordinates of headplate positioning to suit their needs. Additionally, the shape and dimensions of the headplate can be changed to accommodate recordings from specific brain regions. We have used mice ranging from 8 to 14 weeks and both males and females have been used successfully. The two major tools for monitoring neural activity in head fixed mice are through chronic cranial windows, used for microscopy, or through an acute craniotomy, used for electrophysiology. Protocols for these procedures are very well described elsewhere (Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Jordan, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1996-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Headplate implantation procedure\nDiagrams outline key steps for the surgical implantation of a head-fixation headplate. Step 1: cut the skin to expose the skull. Step 2: seal the skin edges with tissue adhesive and roughen bone. Step 3: apply a thin layer of tissue adhesive to the skull surface. Step 4: mark the recording area coordinate. Step 5: affix the headplate to the skull using tissue adhesive. Step 6: apply dental cement. Step 7: cover the skull with silicone sealant.\nPrepare the mouse for surgery.\nAnesthetize the mouse with isoflurane (3% induction, 1.5% for maintenance). Throughout the surgery, make sure to monitor the depth of anesthesia by the pinch withdrawal reflex and the respiratory rate.\nNote: Alternatively, injectable anesthesia can be given intraperitoneally, such as a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) or fentanyl (0.05 mg/kg), midazolam (5 mg/kg) and medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg).",
    "Apply a generous drop of eye ointment to prevent dehydration of the eyes. Similar, to further protect the eyes, whenever possible during the surgery, try to reduce the light source intensity as much as possible.\nTo suppress inflammation, subcutaneously inject carprofen (5 mg/kg).\nMaintain core body temperature at 37°C–38°C by inserting a rectal probe and using a feedback-controlled heating pad.\nSecure the head of the mouse within the stereotaxic apparatus.\nCritical: It is important that the head is firmly fixed and stable. Probe this by gently pushing down on the dorsal part of the head with a cotton swab; there should be no vertical head movement.\nPrepare the surgical field.\nUsing a small-animal clipper or a scissor, remove all fur from the dorsal part of the head. To gently remove loose hair from the skin surface, a small piece of painter’s tape can be used.\nThoroughly disinfect the skin surface using ethanol wipes and iodine swabs.\nTo provide local analgesia, inject lidocaine (10 mg/kg) subcutaneously around the exposed skin surface and where the subsequent skin incision will be made. Wait 10 min for the drug to act.\nWith a scalpel or a scissor and a forceps, make a longitudinal skin incision of about 5–6 mm and pull the skin to the sides to expose the skull surface.\nNote: If the headplate needs to be positioned very laterally (e.g., for recording from lateral higher-order visual areas) it might be necessary to remove parts of the remaining skin and retract the temporal muscle on the hemisphere side that will be recorded from.\nPrepare the skull surface.\nCarefully remove all periosteal soft tissue from the exposed skull by gently brushing the surface with cotton swabs soaked in hydrogen peroxide (1% solution).\nTo prevent infections, seal the skin edges with tissue adhesive (e.g., Vetbond).",
    "Once tissue adhesive is fully dry, with a dental drill or a needle, gently scrape the skull surface — omitting the area above the recorded site — to roughen the bone and increase surface area. It is essential to remove all soft tissue from the skull surface to obtain a stable implant.\nApply a thin layer of tissue adhesive to skull surface to protect the bone overlaying the recording area and to create a base for affixing the headplate.\nOptional: mark the coordinate of the recording area (e.g., primary visual cortex: 2.5 mm lateral and 0.5 mm anterior relative to lambda).\nAffix the headplate to the skull.\nPosition and affix the headplate to the skull surface using tissue adhesive. If a recording area was marked, use the mark as a reference for centering the headplate opening.\nOnce the tissue adhesive is dry, mix dental cement and apply to all exposed skull surfaces except the recording area. Make sure to apply the cement both on the inside and outside of the headplate implant. To apply the dental cement, the wooden end of a cotton swab, cut to a 45° angle can be used.\nOnce the dental cement is fully dry, cover the skull above the recording area with Kwik-Cast silicone sealant.\nProvide postoperative care.\nTo provide pain management, subcutaneously inject a general analgesic such as buprenorphine (1.5 mg/kg) and place the animal in a heated recovery cage for 20–30 min until the mouse is mobile.\nIn the subsequent 2–3 days, provide subcutaneous injections of carprofen (or similar anti-inflammatory drug) and buprenorphine (or similar analgesic) according to the animal experimentation license. We advise one daily injection of carprofen and three daily injections of buprenorphine (with maximally 8 h between injections).",
    "Note: Depending on the geometry of the installed headplate (i.e., the length of the fixation arms) and the home cage of the mice, it might be an advantage to remove the food tray, if this is made of metal bars, and instead provide food on the floor of the cage to reduce the chance of mice losing their headplate implant due to it getting caught in the food tray.\nHabituation to treadmill system\nTiming: 3–6 days\nTo reduce the stress level of the mouse during actual experiments, it is essential to first habituate the mouse to head fixation and voluntary locomotion on the treadmill. Optimally, it is vital that that the same experimenter handles the mice on each day. Furthermore, the duration of head fixation on the treadmill should be gradually increased. The number of days required for mice to habituate and walk and run smoothly on the treadmill varies across mice, but in our hands, three to six days is usually sufficient for this if all parameters are optimized.\nHabituate the mouse to the treadmill system.\nDay 1:\nAt least 3 days after headplate implantation, head fix the mouse to the treadmill system by affixing the headplate to the cap screws using thumbs nuts.\nOptimize the position of the mouse on the treadmill by the adjusting the height (slide the ball-bearing blocks up and down) and position (turn the knobs on the translation stage) of the treadmill relative to the headplate-fixation arms.\nNote: The mouse should be able to sit comfortably on the treadmill (i.e., body position not too far back) and locomote unhindered (i.e., not sitting too high nor being squeezed toward the treadmill surface).",
    "Let the mouse habituate and acclimatize on the treadmill, ideally without interference from the experimenter, for a duration of 10–15 min while sampling and recording the locomotor activity by means of the rotary encoder signal.\nNote: If the mouse at any time during the session notably contorts its body and turns sideways on the treadmill (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]), the experimenter can gently nudge the side of the mouse’s trunk with their fingers to support re-alignment on the treadmill.\nNote: If subsequent experiments will be carried out in darkness, habituate the mice in darkness and vice versa for experiments in light (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for considerations).\nNote: Recording the rotary encoder signals during habituation sessions is not strictly required, but it provides a good output measure for assessing the habituation process of each mouse (e.g., percentage of time spent locomoting, maximal speed, bout durations, and distance covered).\nDay 2–6:\nOn the subsequent days, expose the mouse to gradually increasing durations of head fixation on the treadmill system (e.g., Day 2: 20–25 min, Day 3: 30–35 min etc.). On the final day of habituation, aim to have the mouse on the treadmill system for the duration of the planned experiment.\nAssess habituation process.",
    "To determine if mice are habituated, use the locomotor activity pattern (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]), body trunk posture (should be straight and not contorted), and tail posture (while stationary, the tail should be relaxed and resting on the treadmill surface) as a guide. Optionally, if needed, a further measure to gauge the stress level of the mice could be to track the pupil size dynamics — used as a proxy of arousal level (McGinley et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Privitera et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) — during habituation sessions. After habituation, mice should exhibit dynamic fluctuations in pupil size that correlates with locomotion (McGinley et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1996-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Error bars in (C), (D), and (E) are mean ± standard deviation.",
    "Note: While most mice will habituate and show intermittent locomotion on the treadmill and reduced stress levels after 4–6 days of habituation, some mice might not achieve this and in that case, we advise that those are not included in further experimental recording sessions. To guide this process, researchers can choose to define objective output measures for setting threshold criteria for when mice a habituated (e.g., maximal speed > 30 cm/s and/or locomotion time > 30% of session duration or similar).\nAt the end of the habituation protocol, mice are now ready to enter experimental recordings sessions, such as longitudinal two-photon microscopy (Augustinaite and Kuhn, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), whole-cell patch-clamp recordings (Jordan, 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), or extracellular potassium recordings (Rasmussen et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1996-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
