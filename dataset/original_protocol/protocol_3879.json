    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nSeed Cells\nTiming: 30–60 min\nThis section describes how cells should be prepared.\nTrypsinize, or otherwise detach, the cells from the culture vessel and determine the concentration of cells.\nDilute cells to an appropriate concentration for optimal seeding density. Ideally, plate cells at an approximate density of 30−50%, based on the proliferation rate of the cells and the duration of your planned experiment.\nNote: Assuming a 96-well plate format and 100 μL cultured per well, the seeding stock is generally in the range of 1−5×104 cells/mL (1000−5000 cells/well).\nCritical: Seeding cells in an insufficient volume of media (approximately <70 μL) can result in uneven cell attachment due to the meniscus of the media.\nOptional: Aliquot, incubate, and aspirate a binding agent to the plate (e.g., collagen, poly-lysine, laminin) for cell types which do not readily adhere to tissue culture plates.\nUse a multichannel pipet and reagent reservoir to aliquot the seeding stock into the plate wells. We have found that a multichannel pipet is reliable for seeding an equivalent number of cells in each well and reducing variation.\nCritical: Ensure even and reproducible cell seeding between wells. An IncuCyte® imager detects the number of fluorescent objects within the field of view. The object count is proportional to the number of cells imaged by the machine and variable cell numbers can obfuscate data interpretation.\nCritical: Ensure an even distribution of cells within the wells. Crowding of cells in the center or periphery of a well will affect the number of cells captured within the field of view, which can hinder data collection, analysis, and interpretation. During seeding, avoid creating vortices with the pipet or by rocking the plate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/80-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Pipet-Induced Vortices Will Result in Uneven Seeding of Cells",
    "(A) Avoid ejecting against the corner of a well as this will cause cells to concentrate into the center of the well.\n(B) Avoid ejecting at an angle as the wall curvature will generate a circular vortex concentrating cells into the center of the well.\n(C) Place the pipet tip perpendicular to the wall of the well and gently eject the cell suspension to achieve an even distribution of cells.\nPermit the cells to reattach and reach homeostasis for 16−24 hours.\nPause Point: The following steps will be conducted the next day once the cells have reattached.\nTreat Cells\nTiming: 0.5−2 h\nThis section describes preparing experimental conditions for the SPARKL workflow.\nPrepare 2× labeling media stock. Measure a volume of complete media sufficient to aliquot 50 μL for each well containing cells (plus 5−10% excess for pipetting errors). Add fluorescent reporters to this stock to create a 2× solution.\nPrepare 2× treatment media stock. For each treatment condition, add perturbagens to a volume of culture media sufficient to aliquot 50 μL for sample wells (plus 5−10% excess for pipetting errors).\nNote: Every experiment should include a \"rapid death\" condition; this condition will report maximal death kinetics and signal for analysis. For apoptotic studies, co-treatment of either TNFα with cycloheximide or cycloheximide with ABT-737 (an inhibitor to anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins) is well suited.\nCritical: Do not use a treatment that causes extreme changes to cellular morphology as this will disrupt object quantification. For example, staurosporine (a pan-kinase inhibitor commonly used to induce apoptosis) results in cellular fragmentation and therefore is not suited for applications using SPARKL.",
    "Aspirate culture media off of cells in small batches. We recommend diluting the vacuum force by attaching pipet tips to the aspirator, such as a P10 stacked on a P200 stacked on a P1000, which will minimize loss of cells during aspiration (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Cells do not need to be washed prior to adding labeling or treatment media.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/80-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Replace Culture Media with Media Containing Labels and Perturbagens\n(A) In small batches, aspirate the culture media from wells. Stacking pipet tips will dilute the vacuum force and prevent cell loss.\n(B) Prepare phenol red-free labeling media with fluorescent labels and use a multichannel to aliquot 50% of the final volume into aspirated wells. Do this step rapidly to avoid cell desiccation.\n(C) Prepare phenol red-free treatment media containing the treatments for your experiment. Aliquot 50% of the final volume to the appropriate wells on top of labeling media.\nImmediately following aspiration, aliquot the labeling media onto the cells to prevent them from desiccating. Using a multichannel pipet can reduce the time that cells are not in media (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nAdd treatment media to the appropriate wells. Avoid bubbles on the surface of the media (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nPlace the plate in the IncuCyte® imager and allow the plate to return to temperature prior to scanning (approximately 30 minutes). When the plate is colder than the temperature of the incubator, condensation will form on the plastic and will hinder autofocusing.\nAdd the plate to the IncuCyte® software.\nAdd appropriate vessel to the corresponding tray.\nDefine scanning pattern for plate.\nCritical: do not include wells with no cells!\nSelect channels: these protocols make use of phase, green, and red.\nDefine spectral unmixing: this parameter is variant specific.\nDefine scan schedule and frequency.",
    "Optional: Apply real-time analysis job. Requires a processing definition (see next step).\nNote: We suggest separating the labeling and treatment media stocks and aliquoting the labeling media first after removing the culture media. Since every well will use the same labels, it is faster to aliquot the labeling media, which will help prevent the cells from desiccating. Once the cells are covered in media, there is less of a rush to add the various treatments to the appropriate wells.\nNote: If labeling the plate lid, avoid writing directly over the wells. Markings above the well may affect autofocusing and cause cells to appear blurry.\nNote: Background fluorescence increases with media depth in the well. For a 96-well plate, we recommend always having a final volume of 100 μL per well, which should limit evaporation during the experiment while minimizing contributions to background signal.\nPause Point: At this time, the experiment is underway and the cells are being imaged at regular intervals. If a processing definition already exists and was selected at run-time, the raw images will be analyzed for object detection and quantification. No further steps can be taken until the experiment ends.\nCreate Processing Definition\nTiming: 20−40 min\nThis part of the protocol is specific to an IncuCyte® brand live-cell imager; analogous real-time imagers may or may not have their own built-in software for analysis. Generating a \"processing definition\" (the specific parameters for automated object detection within collected images) is required the first time you conduct an experiment. Once generated, this processing definition can be applied to future experiments in real-time (or previous experiments, retroactively). For more comprehensive instructions, consult the IncuCyte® Technical Note documents.",
    "Note: Processing definitions are specific to the cell type, fluorescent reporters, and magnification. Future experiments which change one of these components will require generating a new processing definition.\nMake an Image Stack of representative frames.\nSelect frames from first and last timepoints as well as regularly spaced timepoints along the duration of your experiment.\nInclude frames which represent the range of label strength and number of cells being labeled. Including a \"rapid death\" condition is highly recommended to gauge the range of signal intensity and set mask parameters appropriately.\nDefine analysis parameters for image correction and object detection (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Do this for each channel being analyzed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/80-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Processing Definitions Normalize Images and Detect Fluorescent Objects\n(A) Top-hat processing determines background fluorescence and subtracts it across the image. This method for image processing is particularly useful for uneven background within the collected images.\n(B) Pixels above a threshold fluorescence will be considered a positive object. Adjusting the edge sensitivity and area filter parameters will improve the quantification of objects while excluding artifacts.\nGraphs and masks are illustrative and not quantitative.\nSelect Top Hat.\nThis setting considers the background trend across the image and subtracts it appropriately before determining fluorescent objects. This method results in more robust image normalization and object detection.\nAdjust the Radius.\nThis determines the size of the sampling disk in Top Hat correction.\nSmaller radii are better for background elimination and normalization (∼30 μm).\nAvoid using a radius which is smaller than an object, which result in decreased sensitivity to detect positive fluorescent objects.\nAdjust the Threshold.\nThis value determines the sensitivity for what is considered a positive object.\nFind a value which eliminates masking background but does not exclude objects.\nOptimize Edge Segmentation.\nThis setting controls the sensitivity for segmenting masks for adjacent objects.",
    "We recommend setting this value at approximately -30 − -40.\nDefine mask filters to optimize object detection and quantification.\nArea: set a minimum to gate out cell debris and non-specific labeling.\nMean Intensity: set a minimum to gate out objects with heterogeneous labeling. This may be useful if large areas of the cell body label, but typically is not necessary to include.\nOptional: Include the \"Overlap\" metric to quantify the number of objects displaying double positivity. This metric can be a useful quality control step to assess how proficiently objects will be detected in each channel. Additionally, this metric can be used in downstream analyses.\nPause Point: Now that the processing definition has been made, it can be applied to experiments retroactively as well as new experiments. Typically, the processing definition will be run on the initial experiment which generated the images for it. Once the IncuCyte® finishes processing the images, continue to the following section for steps on visualizing and processing the data."
