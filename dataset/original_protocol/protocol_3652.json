    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNote: Unless otherwise noted, all steps should be performed at a temperature between 20 and 25°C.\nUrine and stent sample pre-storage preparation\nTiming: 20 min\nHuman urine and stent samples must be partially processed within 4–6 h of collection prior to their frozen storage in order to optimize downstream DNA yield (Jung et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17], Bundgaard-Nielsen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Importantly, urine samples should not be refrigerated prior to their processing due to increased precipitation of urinary sediments, which has been shown to decrease DNA yield (Ribeiro et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26], Ackerman et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). DNA extraction should be performed together once all samples are collected to minimize batch effects.\nMid-stream urine sample preparation\nA volume of 20 mL or greater of mid-stream urine should be collected into a urine collection container by the study participant prior to the stent removal procedure.\nNote: Mid-stream urine is more representative of the bladder microbiota, rather than a first-void urine sample which can closely resemble the periurethral microbiota (Karstens et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). Study participants should be instructed on how to properly perform a clean-catch sample collection, or be provided with a collection device intended for isolation of mid-stream urine (Southworth et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]).\nWith a sterile serological pipette, transfer 20 mL of the sample to a 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the urine for 10 min at 5,000 × g.\nDiscard the supernatant with a sterile serological pipette.\nUsing a sterile filter tip, transfer 1000 μL of nuclease-free water to the sample pellet.\nBriefly vortex the tube to resuspend the pellet, then transfer the entire volume to a labelled 1.5 mL microfuge tube.\nCentrifuge the sample for 5 min at 10,000 × g.\nUsing sterile filter tips, discard the supernatant.\nFreeze the urine pellet at −80°C until DNA extraction.",
    "Note: Although not necessary, nucleic acid preservative agents such as AssayAssure (Thermo Scientific) have been shown to aid urinary microbiome preservation (Jung et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). If such a preservative is to be used, it should be applied to all sample types in an equivalent manner to minimize confounding factors in the downstream sequencing analysis associated with processing conditions.\nUreteral stent sample preparation\nUreteral stents should be collected during their routine removal by the treating urologist.\nUpon stent removal, the urologist should directly place the soiled device into a sterile urine collection container.\nRecord the grade of encrustation of both proximal and distal ends of the stent (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) then freeze the stent at −80°C until DNA extraction.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_577_2.csv\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/577-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Examples of the classification of stent encrustation\n(A) Grade 0, the stent appears like new with no visible fouling.\n(B) Grade 1, the stent is discoloured.\n(C) Grade 2, the stent harbours encrustation < 1 mm in thickness.\n(D) The stent harbours encrustation > 1 mm in thickness.\nNote: The proximal and distal ends of the device should be differentiated in order to appreciate any differences between the device-associated renal and bladder microbiota, respectively. The ends may be denoted by the urologist upon device removal, by the presence of marking indications from the manufacturer, or inferred by discoloration and encrustation differences (Kawahara et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19], Chew et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], Chew and Denstedt, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nExtraction of DNA from stent and urine samples\nTiming: 3 days\nThis section describes the extraction of DNA from urine and stent samples.\nPreparation of stent samples",
    "On the day of extraction, thaw the stent samples to 22°C and grade the degree of stent encrustation on both the proximal and distal ends of the stent. This should be done blinded to the outcome of the first encrustation grading prior to frozen storage.\nInside the biosafety cabinet, use the razor blade sterilized with RNase AWAY to slice a 1 cm segment from each of the proximal and distal ends.\nTo rinse the external surface of the stent segments, use forceps sterilized with RNase AWAY to hold one of the cut segments at a time over a sterile reservoir, and gently pipet 1 mL of nuclease-free water with a sterile filter-tip over the entire external surface of the segment.\nSterilize the razor blade with RNase AWAY again, and slice open the rinsed segment lengthwise to expose the inner lumen.\nAdd the sliced stent segment into the bead plate of the DNeasy PowerSoil HTP 96 Kit utilized for DNA extraction.\nNote: If both urine and stent samples are being investigated, they should be extracted together in the same plate with a completely randomized arrangement in order to minimize batch, plate, and edge effects in downstream analysis (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/577-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. DNA extraction plate layout examples\nTwo plate layout examples are shown, but with the stated procedure, up to six plates may be sequenced at a time. The position of all clinical samples, positive, and negative controls should be randomized across the plate. Samples from the same patient should not be loaded in adjacent wells, and when comparisons are to be made between sample types, these should be distributed across different plates (for example, both urine and stent samples are mixed on each plate, as opposed to one plate for urine, another for stents).\nPreparation of urine samples",
    "Thaw the urine pellets at 22°C.\nUsing a sterile filter tip, pipet 100 μL of nuclease free water onto one pellet, pipetting up and down until the sample becomes homogenous.\nNote: It is important to use water, not PBS, as it has been shown to be incompatible with the PowerSoil Kit (Hallmaier-Wacker et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nTransfer the sample into the bead plate of the DNeasy PowerSoil HTP 96 Kit utilized for DNA extraction.\nInto one well of each plate add 100 μL of the nuclease free water used to pipet the urine pellet and wash the exterior of the stents. This will control for any contaminants in the water in the downstream analysis.\nLeave two wells of the bead plate empty. One will act as a DNA extraction negative control, with no initial sample added but will undergo the entire extraction protocol; this controls for any contaminants in the extraction kit. The other well will act as a negative control for PCR amplification, with no DNA template being added to the PCR reaction; this controls for any contaminants in the PCR reagents (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nPipet the two positive controls with sterile filter tips into 2 wells of the bead plate.\nNote: As with the urine and stent samples, the position of the negative and positive controls should be randomized across plates.\nIsolate DNA from the samples using the DNeasy PowerSoil HTP 96 Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All steps must be performed with sterile filter tips and are aided by the use of an electronic pipette.\nNote: To decrease the potential for contaminating aerosol generation, the electronic pipette’s slowest motorized speed for aspirating and dispensing should be used.",
    "Note: Every time the plates are removed from the sterile biosafety cabinet to a non-sterile area such as the centrifuge, they must be wiped down with RNase AWAY prior to bringing them back into the sterile biosafety cabinet.\nAdd 750 μL of PowerBead solution and 60 μL of Solution C1 to the bead plate loaded with all samples and controls. Seal the plates firmly with the square well mat. Label the positions A1 and H12 on the well mat with a permanent marker to avoid contamination from resealing the bead plate with the mat in the opposite position.\nNote: if Solution C1 has precipitated, heat to 60°C until it is fully dissolved.\nShake plates for 20 min at speed 20 (20 oscillations per second) using the 96-well plate shaker, then centrifuge for 10 min (all centrifuge steps are conducted at 20°C at 2250 × g).\nAdd 500 μL of the supernatant to a fresh plate with 250 μL Solution C2 and mix by pipetting up and down 3 times. Incubate plates at 4°C for 10 min followed by centrifugation for 10 min.\nTransfer the resulting supernatant to a fresh plate and repeat the centrifugation step. Transfer approximately 600 μL of the supernatant to a fresh plate containing 200 μL Solution C3 and mix by pipetting up and down 3 times.\nIncubate the plate at 4°C for 10 min followed by centrifugation for 10 min. Transfer the entire volume, with the exception of the pellet, to a fresh plate for centrifugation.\nNote: The pellet from Solution C3 can be extremely loose, so great care should be taken when transferring the supernatant.\nCarefully avoiding the loose residual pellet, transfer 650 μL from each well to a fresh plate containing 1300 μL Solution C4.\nSeal the plates with sealing tape.",
    "Pause Point: At this point, the plates can be stored at 4°C for 12–24 h.\nBriefly centrifuge the plates to avoid condensation transfer between wells after storing the plates for 12–24 h.\nRemove sealing tape and mix the C4 sample solution by pipetting up and down. Transfer 500 μL of the solution to a Spin Plate, and centrifuge for 5 min.\nDiscard the flow-through and repeat i) until the entire sample-Solution C4 mix is processed through the Spin Plate.\nEnsure the appropriate ethanol volume has been added to Solution C5-D, and add 500 μL of C5-D to the Spin Plate.\nCentrifuge the Spin Plate twice for ten min, discarding the flow-through between spins.\nAdd 100 μL Solution C6 to the Spin Plate, incubate at 22°C in the biosafety hood for 10 min. Elute the DNA into the microplate by centrifuging for 15 min.\nMeasure the nucleic acid concentration using a Qubit fluorometer.\nNote: Although DNA concentration may vary greatly by sample type and disease state (i.e., during a urinary tract infection), a minimum concentration that most samples should yield is 1 ng/μL.\nSeal the microplate with the rubber strips provided in the kit using RNase AWAY-sterilized forceps, being careful not to touch the underside of the rubber stoppers. With a permanent marker, label the top of the rubber strips with A1-12, and the bottom of the strips with H1-H12.\nPause Point: Store DNA at −20°C until downstream processing.\nPCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene V4 region library preparation\nTiming: 4 h\nThis section describes PCR reaction set up and cycling conditions for sequencing the bacterial 16S rRNA gene V4 region with minimal contamination.\nArray primers into 96-well microplates.\nPrepare primer stocks to 3.2 μM.",
    "Using a Biomek automated workstation in a UV-sterilized enclosure, dispense with filter tips 10 μL of the forward primers by row, and the reverse primers by column.\nNote: For example, Plate 1 well H12 will contain Forward #4 and #Reverse 24. Plate 6 well H12 will contain Forward #24 and Reverse #24.\nNote: If an automated liquid handling robot is not available, manual preparation may be performed in a UV-sterilized biosafety hood with PCR-grade filter tips and careful attention to pipetting precision.\nIf using DNA that has been stored frozen, thaw at 22°C and briefly centrifuge before removing the rubber strip caps inside the biosafety cabinet.\nTo remove the rubber caps, use forceps sterilized with RNase AWAY and gently peel the strip off, being careful not to contact the underside of the strip.\nPlace the strip on a UV-sterilized surface with one of 12 labels for each of columns 1–12.\nSeal the plate with a sealing mat to transfer to the sterilized Biomek enclosure, then unseal the plate.\nUsing the Biomek automated workstation with filter tips, transfer 2 μL of DNA (on average, this contains 20 ng of DNA) from the DNeasy PowerSoil microplate into the corresponding well of the primer plate.\nNote: Other than the negative controls, template DNA concentration should be ≥ 1 ng/μL (Multinu et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). Any samples with concentrations >50 ng/μL can be diluted to 10 ng/μL.\nUsing a filter pipette tip, transfer 2000 μL of Promega GoTaq hot-start colorless master mix into a sterile reservoir inside the workstation.\nUsing the automated workstation and a multichannel 20 μL head, transfer 20 μL of the master mix from the reservoir to each well of the 96-well plate, with pipetting up and down to mix.",
    "Seal the plates with foil plate covers very tightly and briefly centrifuge to remove air bubbles in the wells.\nCarry out amplification in the thermocycler with the lid temperature maintained at 104°C, and the cycle conditions stated in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_577_3.csv\n16S rRNA amplicon sequencing procedure\nTiming: 4 days\nThis section describes the process of sample clean-up, and the Illumina sequencing conditions. These methods were performed at London Regional Genomics Centre in London, Ontario, Canada (www.lrgc.ca[href=http://www.lrgc.ca]).\nQuantitate the concentration of the PCR amplicons using the PicoGreen dsDNA reagent kit and a fluorescent microplate reader (e.g., Molecular Devices SpectraMax M5) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: To verify the size of the PCR amplicon (~290 bp), 1 μL of the PCR product may be run on a Bioanalyzer DNA chip.\nPool the amplicons equally such that approximately 50 ng of DNA per sample is loaded for sequencing.\nNote: This amount of DNA may not be attainable from negative controls, but all samples should be loaded as equally as possible.\nPerform the sequencing with an Illumina next-generation sequencer (e.g., MiSeq System) using a 600-cycle reagent kit. The sequencing run should be carried out as 2 × 260 cycles utilizing 5% Phi-X Control V3, with a cluster density of approximately 1100.\nNote: When sequencing low bacterial abundance samples like urine and ureteral stents with the described methodology, as many as 500 samples may be run at a time and still achieve read depth capable of taxonomic profiling (>15 million reads per run). However, with specimens higher in diversity and bacterial abundance such as feces, higher per-sample read depth necessitates fewer samples per run. Exact read thresholds and sequencing depth will depend on the study question, environment being sampled, and sequencing technology."
