    "This protocol is the standard of care in our institution.\n1. Insertion of the PVAD (e.g., Impella CP)\nObtain common femoral access over the lower half of the femoral head under fluoroscopic and ultrasound guidance using a micro-puncture needle9,10. Position the micro-puncture sheath and obtain an angiogram of the femoral artery to confirm appropriate arteriotomy location11.\nInsert a 6 Fr sheath in the femoral artery.\nIf there is concern for ilio-femoral disease, insert a pigtail catheter in the inferior portion of the abdominal aorta and perform an angiogram of the iliofemoral system to ensure there is no significant peripheral artery disease (PAD) that may preclude PVAD insertion. If there is moderate disease or calcification of the iliac arteries consider using a longer 25 cm 14 French sheath so that the tip of the sheath is in a relatively healthy segment of the abdominal aorta.\nSerially dilate the arteriotomy site over a stiff .035\" wire using 8, 10 and 12 Fr dilators sequentially. Then, insert the 14 Fr peel away sheath under fluoroscopic guidance, ensuring the tip advances without resistance.\nAdminister heparin bolus (~100 U/kg body weight) for an ACT goal of 250 to 300 s. Alternative anticoagulation include bivalirudin and argatroban.\nUse a pigtail catheter to cross into the LV using a .035\" J tipped wire. Remove the J wire and check an LVEDP.\nShape the tip of the exchange length 0.018\" wire included in the kit and insert it into the LV so that it forms a stable curve at the LV apex.\nMake sure ACT is at goal (250 to 300 s) before insertion12,13.\nRemove the pigtail catheter and insert the pump by loading the wire on the pre-assembled loading red lumen (e.g., EasyGuide) until it exits near the label.",
    "Remove the loading red lumen by gently pulling on the label while holding the catheter.\nAdvance the device in small increments under fluoroscopic guidance into the LV over the 0.018\" wire.\nPosition the pump in the LV with its inlet 4 cm below the aortic valve and make sure it is free from the mitral chordae. Being too close to the apex can cause PVCs and trigger \"suction alarms\". Remove the .018\" wire and once removed, start the pump. Remove excess slack so the pump rests against the lesser curvature of the aorta.\nMonitor the console to make sure the motor current is pulsatile and aortic waveform is displayed. If a ventricular waveform is displayed, the pump may need to be pulled back.\nIf the device needs to be left in situ, remove the peal-away sheath and insert the repositioning sheath pre-loaded on the device.\nCheck the device position on fluoroscopy and the waveforms on the console again.\nPalpate (or sense with Doppler) the distal lower extremity arterial pulses including dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial prior to and after insertion of the device. Document this appropriately in the patient's medical record.\nIf pulses or dopplers cannot be obtained, consider taking a lower extremity angiogram using the wire re-introducing port located on the side of the device or using another access to ensure non-obstructive flow to the lower limb.\nIf flow is obstructed, place a reperfusion sheath prior to transferring the patient to the CCU. In patients with PAD who are at high risk for obstructive flow, strongly consider inserting the reperfusion sheath prior to placement of the 14 Fr sheath (i.e., after step 1.4 listed above).\nMonitor patients treated with a PVAD in the critical care unit (CCU) by personnel trained in its use.\n2. Post-procedural care\nApply sterile dressing.",
    "Position the device at a 45Â° angle when entering the skin (gauze underneath the repositioning sheath can be helpful to maintain this angle). Failure to do so may result in the arteriotomy oozing, leading to formation of a hematoma. It is also helpful to place sutures with forward pressure to avoid device migration and to prevent bleeding.\n\tNOTE: Securing the lower extremity with a knee immobilizer can also limit device migration as a reminder to patient not to bend/move the effected limb. This should not be fastened too tightly so as not to compromise circulation.\nContinue to perform routine pulse checks (palpable or Doppler).\n3. Positioning\nUse bedside transthoracic echocardiogram to confirm appropriate device position either prior to transfer or immediately on arrival to the cardiac ICU, depending on availability of a point of care ultrasound.\nUse a parasternal long axis view to assess device position. A subxyphoid view may also be used if parasternal long axis view is not obtainable. A measurement from aortic valve to the device inlet should ideally be 3-4 cm for proper positioning of the device.\nUse echocardiograms to note the position of the device as it relates to the mitral valve.\nWhen a device needs to be repositioned, turn down the device to P2, unscrew the locking mechanism on the sterile cover to advance or retract the device. One can torque as advancing or retracting if the pigtail or inlet is too close to the mitral valve.\nLock the device in the new position and document the new position.\nFollowing this, increase the device to the desired level of support.\nAfter increasing the level of support, reevaluate the device position as the device can jump forward when speed increases.",
    "NOTE: If the device has been pulled back across the aortic valve, repositioning is better done in the cath lab under fluoroscopy guidance.\n4. Weaning\nConsider weaning when vasopressors/inotropes are at low doses or completely weaned off. Hemodynamics should be continuously monitored to maintain a CPO > 0.6 W. Carefully monitor right ventricular (RV) hemodynamics with a goal to maintain right atrial pressure (RAP) <12 mmHg and pulmonary artery pulsatility index (PAPI) >1.014. Also consider obtaining pH, mixed venous saturations and lactate every 2-6 hours to monitor cardiac work and end-organ perfusion.\nDecrease power by 1-2 levels over 2 hours, noting CPO, PAPI, RAP, MAP and urine output. If CPO drops <0.6 W, RAP begins to increase, urine output drops > 20 mL/h or MAP <60 mmHg, increase power to previous level.\n5. Removal12\nUse vascular closure devices to close the arteriotomy access site with complete deployment of the device performed when the large bore sheath is removed14. Temporary endovascular balloon tamponade or \"dry field closure technique\" is an effective and safe way to ensure hemostasis of the large bore access site15.\nDial down to P1 and pull back the device into the aorta followed by change to P0 and disconnect the device from the console as the catheter is pulled out of the body.\n\t\nNote that the device should not be left across the aortic valve at P0 due to the risk of aortic regurgitation.\nIf considering manual hemostasis, wait until ACT <150 and hold 3 minutes of pressure per French size.\nSubscription Required.
