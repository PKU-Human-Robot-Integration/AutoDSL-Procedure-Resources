    "All human blood samples used in the protocol described below were purchased as de-identified samples. No human subjects were directly involved or recruited for this study. The guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki should be used when research involves human subjects.\n1. Erythrocyte isolation from whole blood\nAdd 500 µL of whole blood in acid citrate dextrose (ACD) (stored at 4 °C) to a microcentrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: Whole blood was purchased in ACD. According to the company, 1.5 mL of ACD is added to 7 mL of whole blood (8.5 mL total volume).\nCentrifuge the whole blood at 700 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT) and remove the clear plasma and the thin buffy coat using a pipette to leave the red erythrocyte layer.\nPrepare 1 L of Ringer solution containing 125 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 32 mM HEPES, 5 mM glucose, and 1 mM CaCl2. Adjust the pH to 7.4 by adding 2 µL drops of 1.0 M NaOH. To prepare glucose-free Ringer solution, follow the same protocol, but do not include glucose in the solution.\nWash the erythrocytes 2x in Ringer solution by suspending the cell pellet in 1.5 mL of Ringer solution, centrifuging at 700 x g for 5 min at RT, and removing the supernatant.\nMake a 0.4% hematocrit by resuspending 40 µL of the erythrocyte pellet in 9,960 µL of glucose-free Ringer solution to reach a final volume of 10 mL.\n\tNOTE: Hematocrit is a term used to refer to the volume fraction of erythrocytes in suspension. A 0.4% hematocrit is a suspension containing 0.4% erythrocytes.\nIncubate the cell suspension at 37 °C for 7 days.\n2. Treatment of erythrocytes with ionomycin and measurement of hemolysis",
    "Dissolve 1 mg of ionomycin calcium salt in 630 µL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to reach a final concentration of 2 mM. Aliquot and store at -20 °C.\nTake 1 mL of the 0.4% hematocrit from step 1.5 and add 0.5 µL of 2 mM ionomycin to reach a final concentration of 1 µM. Incubate for 2 h at 37 °C.\n\t\nUse 1 mL of the hematocrit with no ionomycin treatment as a negative control.\nCentrifuge the ionomycin-treated and untreated hematocrits at 700 x g for 5 min at RT, and remove their supernatants to leave the cell pellets at the bottom of the tubes.\nWash the cells 3x with Ringer solution by suspending the cell pellets in 1.5 mL of Ringer solution, centrifuging at 700 x g for 5 min at RT and discarding the supernatants.\nTo measure hemolysis, add 1 mL of the untreated 0.4% hematocrit from step 1.5 to a microcentrifuge tube and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C as the negative control for hemolysis (0%).\nAdd 1 mL of the untreated 0.4% hematocrit from step 1.5 to a microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 min at RT. Remove the supernatant and add 1 mL of distilled water to the cell pellet and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C as the positive control for hemolysis (100%).\nAdd 1 mL of the ionomycin-treated 0.4% hematocrit from step 2.2 to a microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the untreated cells, treated cells, and the cells in distilled water at 700 x g for 5 min at RT.\nTake 200 µL of the supernatants and add to a 96-well plate.\nMeasure the absorbance at 541 nm using a microplate reader.\nCalculate the hemolysis using Equation 132:\n\t%Hemolysis = (AT - A0)/(A100 - A0)*100",
    "where A0 is the absorbance of erythrocytes in Ringer solution, A100 is the absorbance of erythrocytes in water, and AT is the absorbance of treated erythrocytes by ionomycin.\n3. Annexin-V binding assay\nDilute 2 mL of the 5x annexin V binding buffer in 8 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to obtain 1x binding buffer.\nResuspend the ionomycin-treated and untreated cell pellets from step 2.4 in 1 mL of 1x binding buffer.\nTake 235 µL of the cell suspensions in the binding buffer and add 15 µL of Annexin V-Alexa Flour 488 conjugate.\nIncubate the cells at RT for 20 min in a dark place. Centrifuge at 700 x g for 5 min at RT and remove the supernatant.\nWash the cells 2x with 1x binding buffer, by suspending the cell pellet in 1.5 mL of the binding buffer, centrifuging at 700 x g for 5 min at RT and removing the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellets in 250 µL of 1x binding buffer for flow cytometry measurements.\n4. Flow cytometry\nTransfer 200 µL of the annexin-V stained erythrocytes to 1 mL round bottom polystyrene tubes compatible with flow cytometry.\nLogin to the flow cytometry software and click on the new experiment button. Click on the new tube button. Select the global sheet and choose the apply analysis to measure the fluorescence intensity with an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and an emission wavelength of 530 nm.\nSet number of cells to 20,000 to be collected for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis.\nSelect the desired tube and click on load button. Click on record button for forward scatter and side scatter measurements. Repeat for all samples.\nRight click on specimen button and click on apply batch analysis to generate the result file.",
    "Right click on specimen button and click on generate FSC files.\nAdd the flow cytometry data (FSC files) into the workplace of flow cytometry software.\nAnalyze the control data by selecting the cell population of interest and adding statistics for eryptosis value.\n\t\nDouble click on control and select histogram versus fluorescence intensity.\nClick on gate button to draw a gate on the histogram which indicates the percentage of eryptosis.\nApply the same statistics for all other experimental tubes to obtain the eryptosis values. Right click on control and select copy analysis to group.\nAfter properly gating all samples, transfer the analyzed data by dragging and dropping them into the layout editor.\n\t\nOverlay the analyzed data with control in layout editor.\nSet the desired histograms and intensities by changing the x and y axis of the overlaid graphs.\nExport image files by clicking on export button and save the graphs in desired location.\n5. Confocal microscopy\nTransfer 5 µL of annexin-V-stained cells on a microscope slide and cover it with a cover slip. Keep in a dark place to prevent photobleaching.\nUse Argon laser of the confocal fluorescence microscope to observe the cells excited at 488 nm with desired magnifications.\n\tNOTE: A confocal microscope is not necessarily needed and any microscope with fluorescence capabilities can be used to obtain fluorescence images that demonstrate annexin-V binding.\nObtain fluorescence images of the control (non-treated cells) and treated cells.\n\tNOTE: Non-treated cells are expected to show very weak fluorescence signals, whereas treated cells are expected to show bright green fluorescence on their membranes.\nSubscription Required.
