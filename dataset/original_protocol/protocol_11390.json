    "Experiments using xenograft tumors were approved by the Rutgers University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee as set forth under the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health.\n1. Protein Extraction\nPrepare lysis buffer (Table 1). (The volume depends on the number of samples to be harvested.) For in vitro cell samples, proceed to step 1.2. For tumor tissue, proceed to step 1.3.\nHarvesting cells\nCollect the cells in a 50 mL conical tube and spin them at 700 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and keep the pellet on ice. Repeat this step for all dishes to collect the cells into one pellet. (Typically, about 5 nearly confluent 15-cm dishes of cells are needed for 5 mg of protein, but this may be dependent on the cell line and needs to be determined empirically by each investigator.)\nWash the pellet with 30 mL of chilled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and spin at 700 x g for 5 min at 4 °C before aspirating the PBS. Add 1.5 mL of lysis buffer per 5 mg of protein used to the cell pellet. Pipet up and down a couple of times. Skip to step 1.4.\nHarvesting tissues\nWeigh the tumor and add 2 mL of ice-cold lysis buffer for every 100 mg of tissue in a culture test tube. (Typically, 50 to 150 mg of tissue wet weight is needed.)\nHomogenize the lysate using a hand-held or benchtop homogenizer (pulse 2x for 15 s.) Clean the homogenizer before the first sample and between samples by using 10% bleach, 70% ethanol, and deionized water in succession.",
    "To reduce and alkylate, heat the homogenized samples at 95 °C for 5 min. Then cool them on ice for 15 min. On ice, sonicate the lysate 3x (i.e., pulse for 30 s with 60 s pauses between pulses). The sample should not be viscous or clumpy at this point. Heat the lysate at 95 °C for 5 min21.\nCentrifuge the lysate in the same sonication tube using a swing bucket rotor at 3,500 x g at 15 °C for 15 min. Collect the supernatant and discard the pellet.\nDetermine the protein concentration by performing a Bradford assay22. If necessary, dilute the lysate to 5 mg/mL with a lysis buffer. Store it at -20 °C.\n\tNote: The experiment can be paused here. Freeze the samples at -80 °C and continue at a later date.\n2. Lysate Digestion\nDilute the sample 12-fold by using 100 mM Tris (pH = 8.5) to reduce the amount of guanidinium. Dilute all samples to the same volume to minimize the effects of unequal digestion. Save 12.5 µg of the undigested lysate to confirm it on a Coomassie-stained gel23.\nFor 5 mg of protein, add 10 µg of Lysyl Endopeptidase (Lys-C) and incubate it at room temperature for 5 - 6 h. Adjust pH to 8.0 by adding 1 M untitrated Tris (pH ~11).\nPrepare 1 mg/mL of L-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin in 1 mM HCl (with 20 mM CaCl2). Add the trypsin at a 1:100 trypsin:protein ratio and incubate it at 37 °C for 3 h.\nAdd the same amount of fresh trypsin as in step 2.3. Incubate it at 37 °C overnight.\nSave 12.5 µg of the digested lysate to confirm the complete digestion on a Coomassie-stained gel23.\n3. Reverse Phase Extraction",
    "Record the lysate volume. Filter the sample by using a 15 mL 10 kDa cutoff filter. Centrifuge the sample at 3,500 x g using the swing bucket rotor (or 3,500 x g in a fixed angle rotor) at 15 °C until the retentate volume is less than 250 µL (this takes approximately 45 - 60 min). Collect the flow-through and discard the retentate.\n\tNote: The experiment can be paused here. Freeze the samples at -80 °C and continue at a later date.\nTo acidify the sample, add approximately 20 µL of 5% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) per mL of lysate. Mix them well and measure the sample pH by using pH strips. Adjust pH to 2.5 using 5% TFA.\nConnect the shorter end of a C-18 column to a vacuum manifold. Set the vacuum between 17 and 34 kPa (or according to the manufacturer’s instructions). Using glass pipettes, wet the column with 3 mL of 100% acetonitrile (ACN). Do not let the column dry.\nUsing glass pipettes, equilibrate the column with 6 mL of 0.1% TFA applied as 2x 3 mL. Load the acidified sample into the column. Do not add more than 3 mL at a time. Adjust the vacuum to target about 1 to 2 drops per second.\nUsing glass pipettes, wash the column with 9 mL of 0.1% TFA applied as 3x 3 mL. Elute the column with 2 mL of 40% ACN, 0.1% TFA. Collect two 2 mL fractions into glass culture tubes. Discard the column.\nCover the eluate tubes with parafilm and punch 3 - 5 holes on the cover using a 20G needle. Freeze the eluate on dry ice for at least 30 min until it is completely solid.",
    "Lyophilize the fractions overnight. On the following day, make sure the samples are completely dry before stopping the lyophilizer. Store the tubes in a 50 mL conical tube with delicate wipes at -80 °C.\n\tNote: The experiment can be paused here.\n4. Immunoprecipitation and Enrichment of pY Peptides24\nResuspend the lyophilized powder with 0.5 mL of ice-cold immunoprecipitation (IP) binding buffer in each fraction. Pool the fractions by transferring the 0.5 mL resuspension volume from the second fraction to the first fraction and save the pipette tip. Vigorously vortex (instead of pipetting up and down) to make sure the sample is completely dissolved before transferring it to a 3.6 mL screw cap cryotube.\nAs in step 4.1., rinse the lyophilization tubes with another 0.5 mL of IP binding buffer (Table 1) in each tube. Transfer the solution to the 3.6 mL screw cap tube using the same pipette tip to minimize any sample loss. Repeat the rinse 1x more, making the final resuspension volume 2 mL (for 5 mg of protein). Measure the sample pH to make sure it is approximately 7.4. If it is too acidic, iteratively add 10 µL of 1M Tris (untitrated, pH ~11). If it is too basic, iteratively add 10 µL of dilute HCl (1:25 or 1:100).\nPre-wash the pY beads (for 5 mg of starting lysate)\n25 µg of 4G10 antibody and 12.5 µg of 27B10.4 antibody are needed per sample. After using a p200 pipette with a cut tip to transfer the antibodies into separate microcentrifuge tubes, wash the antibodies with 450 µL of ice-cold IP binding buffer 2x. Centrifuge them at 100 x g for 1 min at 4 °C and aspirate out the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the beads to a stock concentration of 0.5 mg/mL using IP binding buffer. (Do not vortex the beads.) After aliquoting the necessary slurry (50 µL of 4G10 antibody slurry and 25 µL 27B10.4 antibody slurry per sample) into a single tube, spin down the stock centrifuge tubes at 200 x g for 1 min at 4 °C. Wash the sidewalls with supernatant before returning the beads to storage in the refrigerator.\nAdd pre-washed pY beads to the resuspended sample solution in the screw cap cryotubes. Incubate them at 4 °C on an end-over-end rotator overnight.\nPlace the screw cap cryotubes in a 50 mL centrifuge tube lined with a delicate wipe. Spin down the beads at 100 x g for 1 min. Save the supernatant, which will be used to enrich for pST peptides. (The enrichment for pST begins at step 7 and can be performed in parallel to the pY peptide processing).\nResuspend the beads with 300 µL of IP binding buffer. Transfer them to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube and spin them down at 100 x g for 1 min at 4 °C.\nRinse the incubation tube 3x with 200 µL of IP binding buffer. Transfer the contents to the same Microcentrifuge tube each time. Then spin them down.\nWash the beads in the microcentrifuge tube 3x with 500 µL of IP binding buffer and spin them down at 100 x g for 1 min. Then wash the beads 4x with 450 µL of 25 mM NH4HCO3, pH 7.5, and spin them down at 100 x g for 1 min. Use a fresh 25 mM NH4HCO3 solution from powder every time.",
    "Centrifuge the beads at 1,500 x g for 1 min. Use a gel-loading tip to remove the supernatant completely by dipping the tip of the gel-loading tip slightly below the beads’ surface.\nAdd 4x the bead volume of 0.1% TFA to the beads (i.e., add 300 µL of 0.1% TFA for 75 µg of pY bead slurry). Mix them well and incubate the mixture in a thermomixer at 1,000 rpm for 15 min at 37 °C.\nTransfer the resuspension to a 0.2 µm spin filter. Quickly spin down the elution tube and transfer the residual volume to the same spin filter using a P10 pipet. Spin down the spin filter at 850 x g for 1 min. Transfer the elution to a low protein-binding microcentrifuge tube. Vacuum concentrate the eluate to dryness overnight at 40 °C and with a heat time of 300 min.\n\tNote: The experiment can be paused here. Freeze the samples at -80 °C and continue at a later date.\n5. Titanium Dioxide Enrichment25 of pY Peptides\nResuspend the dried down phosphopeptides in 200 µL of 50% ACN, 0.1% TFA. Vortex and centrifuge them at 10,000 x g for 30 s. Repeat this 1x to resuspend them well.\nPreparing the TiO2 beads contained in tips that have a capacity for 200 µL samples.\n\t\nGently tap on the small tip-side of the tip to move the material to that end. Rinse the tip by adding 200 µL of 100% ACN, followed by inverting the tip and flicking the small end to move the liquid towards the cap.",
    "Using a razor blade, cut the small tip of the tip and place it over a low protein-binding tube. (Avoid using polystyrene tubes as the TiO2 will stick to the sides of the tube.) Remove the cap and insert a micropipette to plunge out the remaining ACN. Repeat the wash with 200 µL of 100% ACN. The TiO2 beads are now located in the low protein-binding tube for the following steps.\nPrecondition TiO2 with 500 µL of 100% ACN 2x. Pipet it to mix the beads with the solvent. Centrifuge them at 100 x g for 1 min.\nCondition TiO2 with 500 µL of 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH ~7) 2x. Wash the beads with 300 µL of equilibration buffer 3x. Because TiO2 is very dense, the beads will settle quickly.\nAdd 400 µL of 50% ACN, 0.1% TFA into the low protein-binding tube, followed by adding 84 µL of lactic acid. Transfer the resuspended phosphopeptides into the low protein-binding tube and incubate them for 1 h at room temperature using an end-over-end rotator.\nCentrifuge the beads at 100 x g for 1 min to pellet them. Wash them with 300 µL of equilibration buffer (Table 1) 2x and spin them down at 100 x g for 1 min.\nRinse the beads with 300 µL of rinsing buffer 2x. Transfer them to a 0.2 µm spin filter. Spin them at 1,500 x g for 1 min.\nTransfer the filter unit to a clean 1.5 mL low protein-binding tube. Elute the contents 2x with 200 µL of 0.9% NH3 in H2O. Measure the pH with pH strips, which should be between 10 and 11. Vacuum concentrate the eluate to dryness overnight to evaporate the ammonia.\n6. Desalting pY Peptides for MS Analyses",
    "Reconstitute the phosphopeptides with 15 µL of 0.1% TFA by vortexing and centrifuging them at 10,000 x g for 30 s to resuspend them. Repeat this 1x to resuspend them well. Do not pipette up and down.\nClean the sample using a C-18 tip with a binding capacity of 5 µg and follow the manufacturer’s protocol.\nCompletely dry the elution volume by vacuum concentration. This takes 1 - 2 h. Resuspend the dried phosphopeptides in 12.5 µL of mass spectrometry solution (see Table 1) (or as recommended by the researcher’s MS proteomics core facility). Vortex and briefly spin the solution down at 10,000 x g for 30 s. Repeat this 2x to resuspend them well. The samples are ready for submission to a mass spectrometry facility (step 11).\n\tNote: The following steps below are related to pST peptide enrichment only.\n7. Reverse Phase Extraction of pST Peptides\nMeasure the peptide concentration of the supernatant acquired from step 4.6 by performing a peptide assay. A sufficient amount for pST mass spectrometry is 2.5 mg.\nAdjust pH to 3.5 with 5% TFA.\nConnect the shorter end of a C-18 column to a vacuum manifold.

Adjust the vacuum to target about 1 - 2 drops per second.",
    "Wash the column with 9 mL of 0.1% TFA applied as 3x 3 mL. Elute the column with 2 mL of 40% ACN, 0.1% TFA. Collect two 2 mL fractions into glass culture tubes. Discard the column.\nCover the eluate tubes with parafilm and punch 3 - 5 holes on the cover using a 20G needle. Freeze the eluate on dry ice for at least 30 min until it is completely solid.\nLyophilize the selected fractions overnight. On the following day, make sure the samples are completely dry before stopping the lyophilizer. Store the tubes in a 50 mL conical tube with delicate wipes at -80 °C.\n\tNote: The experiment can be paused here.\n8. Strong Cation Exchange (SCX) of pST Peptides\nResuspend the lyophilized peptides in 2 mL of Buffer A (Table 1). Pool the fractions for each sample. (The solution will be cloudy.)\nPrepare the vacuum manifold. Connect an SCX column to a 3 mL syringe with the plunger removed. Set the vacuum between 17 and 34 kPa (or according to the manufacturer’s instructions).\nCondition the SCX column with 4 mL of ACN, followed by 4 mL of Buffer A.\nLoad the 2 mL of the sample from step 8.1 and collect the eluate immediately. Load 3 mL of A:B (80.9:19.1) buffer and collect the eluate. Pool the eluates of each sample and aliquot them into 2 mL low protein-binding tubes.\nVacuum concentrate all samples until approximately 30% of the volume remains. (This step takes approximately 2 - 4 h.) Pool the aliquots into 1 low protein-binding tube for each sample.",
