Dissociate cultured cells with Trypsin-EDTA for 5 min.\nAlternatives: Any cell dissociation method may also work in this step.\nNeutralize cells trypsin neutralization solution or with an equal volume of cell culture medium supplemented with 10% or 20% Bovine Calf Serum or Fetal Bovine Serum.\nSuspend cells by pipetting the cell culture medium several times.\nSpin at 300 g for 3 min at 20°C–25°C using a benchtop centrifuge to pellet cells. Meanwhile, count cells using a hemocytometer manually or a cell counter.\nPour out the remaining medium and resuspend cells in a 35 mm plate with a 10 mm collagen-coated coverslip, using 2 mL fresh medium to obtain approximately 150,000 cells/mL.\nNote: The plating density may vary according to the cell type, culture time, and following steps. We suggest conducting preliminary experiments with several seeding densities to reach the best plating density, i.e., 80% confluency for optimal imaging.\nOptional: Sterilized collagen-coated coverslip(s) could be placed at the bottom of a culture dish (e.g., 24-well, 12-well, and 6-well plate). Leave the plate at 20°C–22°C for 30 min which may slow down the speed of adhesion and is helpful if cells tend to clump (troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nIncubate cells at 37°C for 6 h to several days, until cells reach to the desired confluency.\nWhen using suspension cells, for example, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, spin cells (72.26 g for 3 min) onto the poly-lysine coated slide using a cytospin centrifuge, before permeabilization and fixation steps.\nCell permeabilization, fixation, and blocking (Day 1)\nCell permeabilization\nTiming: 30 min",
    "This step removes non-specific background due to signal from membranes, extracellular matrix, etc., Any non-specific loose associations are typically disrupted by the mild detergent, while true tight binding interactions are not affected.\nWash cells with 1× PBS for 3 × 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nTreat cells with 100 μL cytoskeletal (CSK) solution for 5 min on ice.\nRemove the CSK solution gently with pipet.\nTreat cells with the CSK solution for another 5 min on ice.\nFixation\nTiming: 50 min\nThis step preserves cells from decay and stabilizes cellular structure.\nWash cells with 1× PBS for 3 × 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nTreat cells with 100 μL pre-cooled 100% MeOH for 20 min at −20°C.\nThe fixation time may vary according to the cell type. For cell types with high cytoplasmic background, reducing the fixation time to 10–15 min.\nPause point: Fixed cells can be stored in 1× PBS at 4°C for 24 h or transferred to 70% ethanol and stored at −20°C for up to a week. The plates should be sealed with parafilm to prevent drying out during storage, and should be warmed to 20°C–25°C before proceeding the blocking step.\nBlocking\nTiming: 1 h 20 min\nThis step minimizes non-specific binding of primary antibodies within the cell.\nWash cells with 1× PBS for 3 × 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nBlock cells in 100 μL Blocking solution (provided by Duolink® In Situ PLA® Probe kit) for 1 h at 37°C. Alternatively, block cells in 10% BSA in PBS-T.\nTelomere in situ hybridization (Day 1–2)\nTiming: 2 h 40 min\nThis step enables the stable hybridization of the probe to telomere DNA and washes away any excess probe.\nPrepare hybridization mixture containing the telomere—biotin probe (Integrated DNA Technologies).",
    "Note: Biotin DNA probe may be synthesized by other venders, such as Eurofins Scientific.\nTap off blocking solution, add hybridization mix to the central coverslip, and place the plate inside a pre-heated humidified chamber.\nPreheat hybridization oven till reaching to 80°C. Incubate the plate in a humidified chamber (approximately 85% humidity) in preheated oven at 80°C for 3 min to denature DNA.\nNote: Time to denature DNA in 80°C oven can be extended from 3 min to 10 min when using mouse cells with extralong telomeres, such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from C57BL/6 strain.\nIncubate the plate in a humidified chamber for 2 h at 20°C–25°C.\nWash cells with the hybridization wash buffer for 3 × 5 min, and with 1× PBS for 3 × 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: This step is only applied for detecting telomeric DNA by Telomere-FISH using the telomere—biotin probe, if not, skip to “Primary antibodies”.\nProximity ligation assay (Day 1–2)\nAll reagents besides enzymes should be thawed at 20°C–25°C and vortex before use. Enzymes should be kept at −20°C and added to the reaction mix before use. The 5× stock solutions should be diluted with high purity water before use. All incubations should be performed in a humidity chamber. A 40 μL reaction volume can cover 1 cm2 sample area on the coverslip. An open droplet reaction is used. The entire reaction area must always be covered by reagents/solutions.\nPrimary antibodies\nTiming: variable; 1 h to 12 h\nTwo primary antibodies specifically recognize each of the two proximity targets (e.g., DDR proteins and telomere DNA/proteins) in the cell. Primary antibodies must be raised in different species.",
    "Discard the blocking solution, and wash cells with 1× PBS for 3 × 5 min at 20°C–25°C, if telomere in situ hybridization step is skipped. Dilute the primary antibodies (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) to suitable concentrations (e.g., anti-TRF1, anti-TRF2 or anti-Biotin at 1:500 for detecting telomeres; anti-53BP1 or anti-γ-H2AX at 1:1000 for detecting DDR) in Antibody diluent (provided by Duolink® In Situ PLA® Probe kit) and add solutions to each sample (50 μL/coverslip).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1896_5.csv\nIncubate the plate in a humidity chamber ∼12 h (overnight) at 4°C or 1 h at 37°C.\nPLA probes\nTiming: 1 h 40 min\nSecondary antibody-coupled PLA MINUS and PLA PLUS oligonucleotides (or probes) recognize and bind two individual primary antibodies according to their host species.\nPreparation of PLA probe solution: mix and dilute the two PLA probes 1:5 in Antibody diluent, e.g., for a 40 μL reaction, take 8 μL of PLA probe MINUS stock, 8 μL of PLA probe PLUS stock, and 24 μL of the antibody buffer (provided by Duolink® In Situ PLA® Probe kit), and mix the solution by pipetting up and down. Allow the mixture to sit for 20 min at 20°C–25°C.\nTap off the primary antibody solution from the coverslip at the bottom of the plate.\nWash the plate with 2 mL 1× Wash Buffer A on a shaker with gentle orbital shaking for 3 × 5 min at 20°C–25°C. Tap off the excess wash buffer at the last wash.\nAdd 40 μL PLA probe solution.\nPreheat a humidity chamber till 37°C. Incubate the plate in pre-heated humidity chamber for 1 h at 37°C.\nLigation\nTiming: 1 h 10 min\nConnecting oligonucleotides in the Ligation solution hybridize the PLA PLUS and MINUS probes, if both probes are in proximity, which prompts the PLA probes to ligate and form a DNA circle.",
    "Dilute the Ligation solution 1:5 in ddH2O, e.g., for a 40 μL reaction, mix 8 μL of 5× Ligation solution (provided by Duolink® In Situ Detection Reagents FarRed kit) and 31 μL of ddH2O.\nTap off the PLA probe solution from the coverslip at the bottom of the plate.\nWash the plate with 2 mL 1× Duolink In Situ Wash Buffer A for 3 × 10 min under gentle agitation on a shaker. Discard the excess wash buffer A at the last wash step.\nAdd the Ligase (provided by Duolink® In Situ Detection Reagents FarRed kit) to the Ligation solution at a 1:40 dilution (e.g., for a 40 μL reaction add 1 μL of Ligase to 39 μL of Ligation solution) and vortex.\nAdd 40 μL Ligation-Ligase solution to each coverslip.\nIncubate the plate in a pre-heated humidity chamber for 30 min at 37°C.\nAmplification\nTiming: 1 h 50 min\nThe DNA polymerase Phi29 pol generates many complement copies of the DNA circle, followed by hybridization to fluorophore-conjugated nucleotides to produce the signals, which can be detected by standard fluorescence microscopy.\nPreparation of Amplification solution: dilute the Amplification stock (provided by Duolink® In Situ Detection Reagents FarRed kit) 1:5 in ddH2O and mix (e.g., for a 40 μL reaction, mix 8 μL of 5× Amplification stock and 31.5 μL of ddH2O).\nTap off the Ligation-Ligase solution from the coverslip at the bottom of the plate.\nWash the plate in 2 mL 1× Duolink InSitu Wash Buffer A for 2 × 3 min under gentle agitation on a shaker. Tap off all wash solution after the last wash.",
    "Add the Polymerase (provided by Duolink® In Situ Detection Reagents FarRed kit) to the Amplification solution at a 1:80 dilution and vortex (e.g., for a 40 μL reaction, mix 0.5 μL of Polymerase and 39.5 μL of Amplification solution).\nAdd the Amplification-Polymerase solution to each coverslip.\nIncubate the plate in a pre-heated humidity chamber for 100 min at 37°C, covered with foil.\nNote: Let the coverslip dry briefly at 20°C–25°C in the dark. Mount the coverslip onto the slide using ProLong™ Gold Antifade mounting solution with DAPI, if secondary antibody immunofluorescence staining step is skipped. Seal the edges with nail polish.\nCritical: Containing light-sensitive reagents: Work in reduced-light environment from this time forth.\nSecondary antibody immunofluorescence staining (Day 2)\nTiming: variable; 2 h to 12 h\nThis step detects the DDR proteins and the telomeric proteins by IF or the telomeric DNA by Telomere FISH, which helps verify PLA and could be omitted after the PLA procedure is successfully established (See details in “expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]”).\nTap off the Amplification-Polymerase solution from the coverslip at the bottom of the plate.\nWash the plate in 2 mL 1× DuolinkInSitu Wash Buffer B for 4 × 10 min and then in 0.01 × Wash Buffer B for 5 min.\nWash the plate in 2 mL 1× PBS for 1 × 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDilute the secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorophores (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) to suitable concentrations, e.g., 1:500 in the Antibody Diluent and add 40 μL secondary antibody solution to each coverslip. Incubate the plate in a humidity chamber ∼12 h at 4°C or 1 h at 37°C.\nTap off the secondary antibody solution from the plate. Wash the plate with 2 mL 1× PBS-T on a shaker with gentle orbital shaking for 3 × 5 min at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Let the coverslip dry briefly at 20°C–25°C in the dark. Mount the coverslip onto the slide using the ProLong™ Gold Antifade mounting solution with DAPI (0.01 mg/mL). Seal the edges with nail polish.\nPause point: Slides can be stored at 4°C for up to 2 months or −20°C for extended time before microscope image acquisition.\nImage acquisition of PLA, IF, telomere-FISH signals by fluorescent microscope\nTypically, images from 20–30 fields per slide are captured in z-stacks in four fluorescent channels, using a confocal fluorescent microscope with 100× (oil) objective. Capture images using a DAPI filter for nuclear staining, Cy5 filter (when DuolinkFarRed detection kit is used) for detection of PLA signals, FITC, Cy3, or Texas Red filters for detection of different targets (telomeric markers, e.g., TRF1, TRF2, or Biotin. DDR proteins, e.g., 53BP1 or γ-H2AX. To remove background from the image, adjust the brightness and contrast of the captured raw images using software, such as ImageJ or Adobe photoshop. Of note, the adjustment should be applied to all the images of the experiment.\nNote: Capture all the signals in z-stacks. Each channel should have the same z-stacks.\nNote: Acquisition of each channel should avoid binning.\nNote: Exposure time should be adjusted to keep all channels with a good signal-to-noise ratio (such as >3-fold) and prevent the signals to be oversaturated. DAPI signal intensity versus IF, Telomere FISH, and PLA signals is supposed to be no less than 5:1 ratio. IF, Telomere FISH, and PLA signals should be easy to discriminate.",
    "Note: Count TIF numbers per nucleus in PLA images, such as ≥5 TIFs/cell, followed by quantification of the percentage of cells with ≥5 TIFs. TIF signals by IF or IF-Telomere FISH are determined by colocalization of DDR proteins (such as 53BP1 and γ-H2AX) and telomeric proteins (such as TRF1 and TRF2) IF signals or by colocalization of 53BP1 or γ-H2AX IF signals and Telomere-FISH signals. Successful PLA procedure is indicated by the colocalization of most TIF signals by PLA with those by IF or IF-Telomere FISH. The IF (or IF-Telomere FISH) approaches serve to verify PLA, which can be omitted. See details in “expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]”.\nNote: The representation of the data can be performed in any graph making software, e.g., GraphPad Prism to display TIF numbers per cell by column graph or a box-and-whisker plot.\nCritical: If slides are stored at 4°C or −20°C before imaging, warm slides at 20°C–25°C for 1 h or 37°C for 10 min to prevent possible condensation on the surface of slides. Use 70% ethanol to clean slides."
