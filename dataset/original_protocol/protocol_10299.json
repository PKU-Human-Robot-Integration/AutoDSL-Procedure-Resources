    "1. Obtain Nesprin-2G Sensor DNA and Other Plasmid DNA\nObtain Nesprin-2G TS (tension sensor), Nesprin-2G HL (headless) control, mTFP1, venus, and TSmod from a commercial source. Propagate all the DNA plasmids and purify them using standard E. coli strains, such as DH5-α, as described previously12,13.\n2. Transfect Cells with Nesprin-2G and Other Plasmid DNA\nGrow NIH 3T3 fibroblasts cells to 70-90% confluence in a 6-well cell culture dish in a standard cell culture incubator with temperature (37 °C) and CO2 (5%) regulation. For the cell growth medium, use Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.\nIn a cell culture hood, remove the medium and rinse each well with approximately 1 mL of a reduced-serum cell medium. Add 800 µL of reduced-serum cell medium to each well and place the 6-well chamber in the incubator.\nPipette 700 µL of reduced-serum cell medium into a 1.5 mL tube with 35 µL of lipid carrier solution to form the \"lipomix\". Mix by pipetting. Label the tube with an \"L.\"\nGather six 1.5 mL tubes and label them 1 through 6. Pipette 100 µL of reduced-serum cell medium into each tube.\n\t\nUsing the plasmid DNA concentration from step 1, pipette 2 µg of Nesprin 2G-TS into tubes 1 and 2. Pipette 2 µg of Nesprin-HL into tubes 3 and 4. Pipette 1 µg of mTFP into tube 5. Pipette 1 µg of mVenus into tube 6. Do not re-use pipette tips when pipetting different types of DNA.\nPipette 100 µL of the lipomix from the \"L\" tube into each labeled tube (1-6) and mix by repeated pipetting. Use a clean pipette for each tube. Incubate for 10-20 min.",
    "Add 200 µL from each labeled tube to a well in the 6-well chamber with 70-90% confluent cells. Label the top of each well with the corresponding DNA added. Place the 6-well chamber in an incubator for 4-6 h.\nAspirate the medium and add 1-2 mL of reduced-serum cell medium to rinse. Aspirate the reduced-serum cell medium, add 2 mL of trypsin to each well, and place the 6-well dish in the incubator (5-15 min).\nWhile the cells detach in the incubator, coat 6 glass-bottom viewing dishes with a layer of fibronectin at a concentration of 20 µg/mL dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Allow the dishes to coat the surface in the cell culture hood (approximately 20 min).\nNeutralize the trypsin by adding 2 mL of DMEM once the cells are detached.\nTransfer the contents of each well to a labeled 15-mL centrifuge tube and spin down at 90 x g for 5 min in a swinging rotor centrifuge. Aspirate the supernatant and re-suspend each cell pellet in 1,000 µL of DMEM by pipette mixing.\nAspirate the fibronectin mixture from the glass dishes and pipette 1,000 µL of each cell suspension onto the glass dishes.\nAfter the cells settle to the bottom of the glass dishes (~15 min), add another 1 mL of DMEM + 10% FBS + 1% Pen-Strep to each well and place in the cell incubator. Allow the cells to attach and express sensor for at least 18-24 h.",
    "NOTE: Cells are transfected using commercial cationic lipid transfection reagents (see the Table of Materials). Alternatively, stable cell lines can be selected by using a plasmid with a gene conferring resistance to a toxin (the pcDNA plasmids for Nesprin-TS and -HL are available on a DNA repository website (see the Table of Materials) provide cells expressing geneticin resistance). Additionally, viral infection methods (lentivirus, retrovirus, or adenovirus) can be utilized to express the sensor in cells that are hard to transfect.\nIn addition to Nesprin-TS, transfect additional cells with the Nesprin HL zero-force control, as described in steps 2.1-2.12; TSmod can also be used as a zero-force control and should exhibit similar FRET to Nesprin-HL.\nTransfect cells with mTFP1 and venus to generate spectral fingerprints (see step 4).\n\tNOTE: mTFP1 and venus typically express at higher levels than Nesprin-TS, and as such, lower amounts of DNA may need to be transfected to achieve similar expression levels.\n3. Verify Transfection Efficiency\nRoughly 18-24 h after completing the transfection, use an inverted fluorescent microscope to examine the efficiency of transfection by comparing the number of fluorescent cells to the total number of cells in view (usually 5-30%).\n\t\nUse a fluorescent microscope equipped with an excitation frequency near 462 nm (mTFP1) or 525 nm (venus) and an emission filter centered near 492 nm (mTFP1) or 525 nm (venus).\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, GFP filter sets will capture a combination of mTFP1 and venus emissions and will allow the confirmation of the transfection efficiency.\nImage live cells within 48 h after transfection.\n\t\nAlternatively, fix cells in 4% paraformaldehyde (in PBS with calcium and magnesium) for 5 min, store in PBS, and view after 48 h8.",
    "NOTE: Beyond 48 h, the signal quality and strength decays. Fixing the cells preserves their state, including the FRET being expressed8; however, cells should only be imaged in PBS, as mounting medium may affect FRET14. Fixed cells can only be compared to other fixed cells, as there may be a change in expression.\n\t\tCaution: Paraformaldehyde is toxic. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE).\n4. Capture Spectral Fingerprints of mTFP1 and Venus Fluorophores for Spectral Unmixing\nIn a cell culture hood, replace the cell medium with imaging medium (HEPES-buffered) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.\nPlace the viewing dishes in a temperature-controlled (37 °C) confocal microscope stage.\nPlace the glass viewing dish with mTFP1-transfected cells over the oil objective at 60X magnification with a numerical aperture of 1.4.\n\tNOTE: The oil is used on a laser scanning microscope on the 60X objective to closely resemble the refractive index of the glass substrate. The oil is placed on top of the objective lens and comes in direct contact with the glass coverslip.\nLocate mTFP1 expressing cells with a 458 nm excitation source and an emission bandpass filter centered at 500 nm.\nWith a fluorescent cell in the field of view, select the spectral detection mode (\"Lambda Mode\" in the software used here) and capture the spectral image (Figure 3-1); include all frequencies beyond 458 nm using 10 nm increments (Figure 3-3). Select a bright fluorescent region (ROI) on the cell (20-pixel radius).\n\tNOTE: The spectral shape of the mTFP1-expressing ROI should remain relatively constant across the cell. If the shape varies considerably, re-adjust the laser and gain settings to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.\nAdd the fluorescent ROI mean, normalized intensity to the spectral database by clicking \"save spectra to database.\"",
    "Optimize the laser power and gain such that a good signal-to-noise ratio is achieved. Settings will vary for different equipment. Using non-fluorescent, untransfected cells as a background reference, increase the gain and power until the cells are bright, but not beyond the dynamic range of the detector (saturation point). Background cells should not have detectable fluorescence after averaging.\nRepeat the process for the venus-transfected cells with the following exceptions:\n\t\nEnsure that the excitation frequency is at 515 nm and that the bandpass filter is centered near 530 nm when locating venus-expressing cells.\nIn \"Spectral Mode,\" use an excitation frequency of 515 nm instead of 458 nm.\n5. Capture Unmixed Images\nSwitch the capturing mode to \"Spectral Unmixing.\"\nAdd the spectral fingerprints of venus and mTFP1 into the unmixing channels (Figure 3, Arrow-2).\nSet the excitation laser back to a 458 nm argon source.\nPlace the Nesprin-TS viewing dish above the 60X oil objective.\nAfter focusing on a fluorescent cell with sufficiently bright expression, adjust the gain and laser power to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio.\n\tNOTE: Since the FRET efficiency of Nesprin-TS is near 20%, the unmixed venus image should be substantially dimmer than the unmixed mTFP1 image. Once an acceptable power and gain setting have been determined iteratively, these parameters must remain constant for all images captured.\nCapture a minimum of 15-20 images of Nesprin-TS cells with relatively similar brightness and avoid excessive pixel saturation (all saturated pixels are removed during image processing).\nRepeat the image capturing process with Nesprin-HL cells using identical imaging parameters.\n6. Image Processing and Ratio Image Analysis\nUsing open-source ImageJ (FIJI) software (http://fiji.sc/), open native format images using BioFormats Reader.\nPre-process the images and compute the ratio images using previously established protocols15.\nSubscription Required.
