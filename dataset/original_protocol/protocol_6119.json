    "The complete experiment could be divided into the following 6 sections (A to F).Flow cell/Biofilm chamber design and manufacturingThe design and manufacturing of the biofilm chamber involved the use of a milling machine to generate the geometry specified in Figure 1. The biofilm chamber geometry was designed with the aim of promoting a laminar flow through a rectangular square duct of variable Reynolds number, being this last parameter adjustable by setting the flow rate at the entrance. The central part of the chamber was divided in smaller ducts having the proper hydraulic diameter to create the hydrodynamic conditions to study within the channels (a laminar flow with Re~100-1,000). The ducts additionally served as a way of taking technical replica of different sections of the chamber placed at different positions. Two lateral chambers were also added at the input and output sides to hydrodynamically stabilize the fluid pattern before entering the channels.  However, alternative methods to create such chambers are also available. Please read Note 1 for a more detailed explanation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190515/20190515025956_0212.jpgFigure 1. Custom-made biofilm chamber blueprint showing (A) side, (B) front and (C) top views. A polycarbonate sheet was carved using a milling machine following this blueprint. The current state-of-the-art in manufacturing technology allows the use of other techniques such as 3D printing to create this design or any other conceptualization in a different type of materials (i.e., PP, PC, etc.) aligned to the purpose of the experiment. Dimensions expressed in mm.Assembly and setting up of the fluidic circuitThe fluidic circuit was designed to work at steady state regime and room temperature while maintaining a constant flow rate passing through the biofilm chamber. Losses of humidity due to constant bubbling can be minimized by using a humidity chamber to increase the relative humidity of incoming air flow.",
    "Additionally, a redundancy criteria was applied when designing the fluidic circuit for culture aeration (by using mechanical stirring and bubbling) and liquid pumping (use of two pumps in series) to avoid an eventual insufficiency in oxygen demand and increased head loss due to growing biomass within the circuit surfaces (i.e., tubing, equipment, etc.).Organize the equipment according with the distribution depicted in Figure 2 (up) taking into account the available space in the room where the device will be placed. Figure 2 (down) shows an oblique and top view of an assembled device. By doing this, you will realize how much tube is needed to connect the different elements and how to place the different elements to make easy all the assembly, operation, inspection and maintenance tasks. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190515/20190515030019_9356.jpgFigure 2. Schematic layout (up) and real views (down) of the experimental device. The system consists of a culture vessel containing a large volume of planktonic bacteria, a fresh input of nutrient and air to feed and aerate the culture, a waste line to work in steady state and a recirculating line to transport culture to the biofilm chamber. This recirculating line was designed to allow the flow of large amounts of liquid culture through the biofilm chamber without consuming unaffordable amount of nutrient medium. Screw tube connectors with valves, flowmeter and flow cell as indicated in Figure 3 using PTFE tape in male threads. Tight firmly the threads without breaking the tape. Then, cut pieces of tubing with the desired length and connect them as illustrated.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190515/20190515030328_2529.jpgFigure 3. Assembly scheme. The device was assembled following this scheme using the different components described in the protocol. Equipment and containers were labeled following an alphanumeric coding (i.e.",
    ", BR-1) to help providing detailed instructions at element level of how to manipulate the device during the start-up and operation.Assemble the custom O-Ring to use for sealing the biofilm chamber lid: cut 400 mm of the 2 mm nitrile rubber O-Ring cord and join both ends using a drop of cyanoacrylate glue. Wait at least 15 min to let the glue being completely dry.Cover the flow cell/biofilm chamber with the lid and seal it using the most appropriate system (see Note 3 for more details).Check that all pumps and air compressor are connected according with designed flow direction in the circuit, and label the biofilm chamber inflow and outflow parts (i.e., a mark on the lid with a pen, a sticker, etc.) to have a reference and know the direction of the flow inside of it (because of the geometric symmetry of the chamber).Prepare electric connections of centrifugal pumps. Manually connect the centrifugal pumps and the AC/DC connectors. To do this, check that AC/DC converters are not connected to the electric grid and cut the extreme of the wire to let it free. Separate positive and negative wires and peel their extremes to allow the connection between AC/DC converter and the pump. Link together the wires of the same polarity coming from the centrifugal pump and the converter, twisting them. Cover the peeled part with electrically isolated tape. Alternatively, if the user has a crimp tool (24 AWG), a butt wire splice connector can be used to connect electrical wiring.Connect all electric equipment to the socket extension lead. All electric wiring must be safely placed out of water contact, thus check that wires are in an elevated position.",
    "Use any method available (tape to hang them, elevated supports to separate them from the surface where water) to avoid potential contact with any liquid in case of leaking or accidental spill.It is recommended to perform a leaking test to detect bad/poor/failed connections:Start by closing all valves of the assembled circuit.Fill a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask with distilled water: this would work as culture vessel (labeled as BR-1 in Figure 3) for the whole experiment. Open valve V-1 and prime the centrifugal pumps (P-1, P-2) by manually filling with distilled water the tube connecting them with the culture vessel (BR-1) to purge as much air as possible. This last step will not be necessary if peristaltic pumps are used to pump the water.Open the flowmeter FM-1 at maximum capacity (if present) and all the valves in the recirculation line (V-1, V-3, V-4, V-6). Switch on the pumps P-1, P-2, checking that the liquid fills the circuit completely.Let the liquid flow for a minimum period of time of 30 min and check periodically that there are no leaks by inspecting the presence of small drops of water in thread connectors or water spills below any element of the circuit. If a leak is detected, stop the flow and try first to tight the connection, dry the zone and restart the flow to see if water still leaks. If the leaking persists, switch off the current, purge the water through the auxiliary line 2 (see Figure 2) and dismount the affected part. Disconnect screws and replace PTFE tape if broken. Add additional layers of PTFE tape to increase isolation when required.Once the leaking test is ended, close valves V-1, V-3, V-4 and V-6, and manually empty culture vessel.",
    "Initial bacterial culture and stocksOne day before the start of the experiment (Day 0), inoculate a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask with 10 ml of M9 minimal medium supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glycerol as carbon source and 0.5 μg/ml of gentamycin. Add directly from a -80 °C frozen glycerol stock of P. putida mt-2.Incubate overnight at 30 °C in an orbital shaker set at 170 rpm.On the day of the experiment start (Day 1), measure the OD600 of the culture and dilute it in 1 L of fresh M9 + 0.2% (w/v) glycerol to reach an OD600 of 0.0025.Prepare a sterile stock of 4 L of M9 + 0.2% (w/v) glycerol supplemented with gentamycin (0.5 μg/ml) prior to start the device.Starting-upThe fluidic circuit must be sterilized prior to beginning the experiment. In order to do that:Connect ISMATEC tubing corresponding to nutrient/waste peristaltic pumping lines PP-1 with 2 mm silicone tubing parts using barbed–barbed straight connectors. Connect also the 2 mm tube line through which the air will be conducted to the main flask with a Male Luer to 1/8\" L Barb Adapter. Use aluminum foil to cover the extremes of both tube lines separately, and autoclave them.Fill 500 ml of 1 L Erlenmeyer flask FL-3, and 700 ml of BR-1 vessel with ethanol 70% (v/v). Introduce the magnetic stirring bar in BR-1 and connect FL-3 to auxiliary line 1. Check that valves V2, V-3, V-4 and V-6 in the recirculating loop are opened and V-1 and V-5 are closed, leaving also the flowmeter open at maximum capacity and switch on the centrifugal pumps. Transfer the stored ethanol in FL-3 to BR-1 until most of the flask is empty and then switch off pumps P-1, P-2. This will fill the auxiliary line 1 with ethanol. Close V-2 and open V-1.",
    "Then switch on again pumps P-1 and P-2, enabling the accomplishment of the sterilization of the system along 60 min.Stop centrifugal pumps P-1, P-2, open valve V-5, close V-6 and switch on P-1 and P-2 to let the ethanol leave the system. The removal of the ethanol has to be performed by letting the pumps to empty the culture vessel BR-1 as much as possible. Avoid its total empty while pumps are still working, as this would introduce air in recirculating line and cause priming problems in the pumps. Disconnect P-1 and P-2 once BR-1 is totally empty (and no air has still entered in the circuit, as said above), and replace the 1 L Erlenmeyer flask FL-3 by another one filled with 1 L of sterile water. Connect again P-1, P-2 to wash with approximately 100 ml of water the remaining ethanol within recirculating line. Close V-5 and open V-6 to let the fresh water enter in the main tank and wash the ethanol during 1 h.Repeat the previously described operations for ethanol–water replacement, but using 1.2 L of fresh M9 medium supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glycerol to replace water in the system, finally leaving 1 L of fresh medium inside BR-1. Microscope settings will be adjusted at this point. Choose a 12-bit or 16-bit resolution for images to obtain a larger sensitivity in grayscale values. Select the channel to detect the fluorescent signal generated by the studied strain (here we recommend GFP because of its stability and performance). Take 10 μl of saturated overnight culture and spread it onto a microscope slide with the tip of the pipette. Place a cover slip onto the sample and examine it with the microscope. Adjust the gain of the microscope and laser intensity to obtain a non-saturated image.",
    "Keep these settings, as they will be constant through the experiment Switch off pumps P-1, P-2 and PP-1, close all valves, disassemble biofilm chamber BC-1 and place it under the microscope following the steps detailed in the image acquisition section. Gather images in the biofilm chamber (if any signal was detected, it would be caused by material and/or liquid medium self-fluorescence). These images will be used to set the background noise threshold.Remove aluminum foil and connect nutrient stock FL-1 and waste tank FL-2 with peristaltic pump PP-1, and their respective outputs with BR-1. Avoid any contact of the tubing with any surface when placing them inside the flasks to prevent contamination. Place the ISMATEC stop coded tubes in the pump cassettes and check that they are properly secured.Connect a 4 mm silicone tubing piece with the output exit of the air pump. Add a tee and connect in the 90° branch a silicone tube with a clamp CL-1, which will serve to regulate air inflow. Then connect the syringe filter by its Luer side with humidity chamber HC-1. Finally, connect the output tube of HC-1 with BR-1 by introducing the free side of the tube in the flask. See Note 2 for additional comments.Switch on the magnetic stirrer at 150 rpm, and connect air pump. With clamp CL-1 regulate the flow of air entering in BR-1 to avoid an excessive foam formation.Connect peristaltic pump at desired target flow rate.Operation of the systemCheck daily that nutrient stock is not empty. Refill it manually as necessary within a sterile environment. The spread of biofilms through the inner surface of the recirculating line (both tubing and equipment) increases the hydrodynamic resistance to overcome, and may partially generate bottlenecks by partial clogging phenomenon.",
    "This can generate drops of flow rate in the recirculating line despite the fact flowmeter is set at a desired flow rate at the beginning of the experiment. Check daily that the flow rate value given by the flowmeter FM-1 is the chosen one for the experiment and adjust it as necessary. Look for any leak that could appear during the operation due to loose connections. Carefully inspect unexpected spills or liquid drops close to joints. If any, stop the pumps and tighten the joints using the adjustable spanner. Wet the leak with ethanol 70% (v/v), dry it and reconnect the system to check that the issue is fixed.Once the experiment is finished, replace the culture with a mixture of sterile water and sodium hypochlorite (NaClO at 10% [w/v]) using auxiliary lines 1 and 2 as described previously. Let the system recirculate the bleach for 1 h to sterilize the recirculating loop. Purge the circuit and refill it with distilled water during 1 h to wash the bleach of the system.Disassembly the circuit, dispose of tubing and biofilm chamber, and store spare parts and pumps.Repeat all previous steps for every biological replica and every tested experimental condition. Image acquisition processAt the desired time, stop centrifugal pumps P-1, P-2 and peristaltic pumps PP-1, close valves V-1, V-6 and open valves V-2, V-5. Under sterile conditions, prepare 300 ml of fresh M9 medium + 0.2% (w/v) glycerol in a 500 ml Erlenmeyer flask and connect it in FL-3. Reduce the set flow rate of FM-1 by 50% of the current value and switch on the centrifugal pumps P-1, P-2. This will wash the flow cell chamber with clear nutrient medium, reducing the unspecific bright produced by planktonic bacteria when gathering images.",
    "Switch off P-1, P-2 when 400 ml of the liquid has been introduced, avoiding the entrance of air in the circuit, and close valves V-2, V-5.Close the valves V-3 and V-4 and disconnect them from the circuit using the adjustable spanner. Fill a beaker with ethanol 70% (v/v) and immerse both elbow threaded-to-tube adapters to avoid outer contamination. If the biofilm chamber is placed on the microscope at the beginning of the experiment, skip this step.Place the biofilm chamber under the microscope and use the bright field to locate the bottom of the material by looking its irregularities. If the chamber material is smooth and transparent, it can be difficult focusing the bottom of the sample (there is no visual reference to guide the user about where to find the position of the bottom): make a small spot with a marker pen at the outer face of the chamber to create a visual reference to follow with the microscope when inspecting the sample.Images can be taken by picking random snapshots or by performing composed images from merging images spatially distributed through a regular grid of n x m images (i.e., see Figure 4). Choose the region of the biofilm chamber to gather it and spot it with a marker if an evolution of the region is necessary. Otherwise, choose a random point in the chamber.Once the images have been acquired, reconnect the biofilm chamber to its original position, checking that the orientation of the chamber matches with flow direction, reset the initial flow rate in FL-1 and reconnect the device to continue the experiment (when applies).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190515/20190515030357_4894.jpgFigure 4.

    "The shape of the device and the whole biofilm pattern colonizing it can be observed only after merging a set of pictures forming a regular grid covering the whole width of the channel."
