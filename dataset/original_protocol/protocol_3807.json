    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLive cell photoprobe labeling\nTiming: 4–5 h\nPre-treatment with compound 1 competes the photoaffinity labeling of compound 2 for protein targets in the relevant cell line. Forward and reverse SILAC treatments are performed as label-swapping experiments to correct for potential quantitation errors. (Park et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13])\nCulture one 15 cm plate of light CCF cells and one 15 cm plate of heavy CCF cells to 90% confluence in appropriate SILAC media.\nEach plate was washed twice with ice cold Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS, 2 × 30 mL) to remove FBS in the culture media.\nNote: Compounds may bind non-specifically to albumin in FBS.\nDissolve 1 in culture media without FBS.\nNote: Warming to 37°C may increase solubility for certain compounds.\nFor forward SILAC:\nPre-treat light cells with compound 1 for 30 min (25 μM, 0.5% DMSO, 37°C and 5% CO2) in cell media without FBS.\nPre-treat heavy cells with DMSO for 30 min in cell media without FBS.\nAfter pre-treatment, in the same media, add compound 2 (0.1% DMSO, 500 nM) to both light and heavy cells for 30 min (37°C, 5% CO2).\nAfter 30 min treatment of compound 2, wash both cells with ice cold serum free media (2 × 25 mL).\nCritical: After photo cross-linking has occurred, cell viability should be checked to compare live cell count from prior to labeling to ensure photo cross-linking has not caused cell death.\nNote: Here, we use 50-fold excess of 1:2, as optimized in Seneviratne et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17].\nNote: At this point, both compound 1 and compound 2 will have sufficiently permeated into cells such that the interactions can be captured. Washes should be completed quickly to prevent compounds from diffusing out of cells. UV irradiation without washes results in higher background signal.",
    "Perform UV irradiation for both plates using a custom modified Rayonet apparatus (360 nm, 4°C, Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). In order to obtain a reproducible, efficient, and specific photo-labeling labeling the following distance and time of labeling will be used: 10 cm distance and 10 min. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/726-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Diagram of UV irradiation\nNote pairwise irradiation, the removal of lids from cell plates and shaking at 4°C during irradiation.\nWash both plates with ice cold DPBS (2 × 30 mL) buffer. Aspirate media during each wash.\nScrape cells in ice cold DPBS buffer (15 mL) using a cell scraper.\nNote: Instead of cell media, cold DBPS can be used during UV irradiation. In this case, step 5a can be skipped.\nNote: Ensure that the UV apparatus is operating correctly. A visual check that includes observing light being turned on is typically sufficient.\nCritical: Place both light and heavy cells into UV apparatus together such that any differences in UV irradiation are normalized between the two conditions.\nCritical: Shake system gently at 50 rpm and 4°C such that cells do not lift during UV irradiation.\nCritical: Removal of culture plate lids will provide more efficient irradiation and thus higher yield. In addition, shaking plates prevent evaporation of media.\nCentrifuge cells (1000 × g, 10 min) to pellet.\nRemove DPBS buffer either via pipetting or aspiration to leave minimal volume.\nStore cells as pellets at −80°C.\nFor reverse SILAC: Repeat steps 3 to 8, but instead of pre-treating the light cells with 1, pre-treat those cells with DMSO. In addition, pre-treat heavy cells with 1.\nFor probe vs. probe controls: Repeat steps 3 to 8, but do not pre-treat either light or heavy cells prior to addition of 2.",
    "For probe vs. no probe controls: Repeat steps 3 to 8 but do not pre-treat either light or heavy cells. Add 2 only to heavy cells while adding DMSO to light cells for 30 min incubation.\nFor UV vs. no-UV controls: Repeat steps 3 to 8 but 1 is added to both light and heavy cells. Only perform UV irradiation to heavy cells while leaving light cells in the dark at 4°C for 10 min.\nNote: These control pairings in steps 9–12 provide important comparisons to eliminate non-specific-binding and UV cross-linking proteins in the MS-based quantitative proteomic analysis.\nMS/MS sample processing\nTiming: 2.5–3 days\nSamples are processed such that probe-labeled proteins are enriched via streptavidin beads and then subsequently digested into peptides for quantitative proteomic analysis.\nNote: For all steps in MS/MS sample processing, it is important to use Protein LoBind Tubes to prevent protein from binding to tubes.\nRe-suspend heavy and light cell pellets separately with 0.5 mL DPBS buffer pH 7.2.\nCritical: For efficiency of CuAAC chemistry, amine-based buffers like Tris should be avoided because these groups chelate Cu(I) and prevent the formation of active catalyst (Parker and Pratt, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nNote: Adding 0.25% SDS can also work but higher SDS concentrations may induce non-specific CuAAC chemistry and thus higher background.\nAdd 1× benzonase (25 U/mL) to break down DNA/RNA and reduce sample viscosity. Dilute benzonase (25 kU/mL) by adding 6 μL of stock to 60 μL DPBS buffer pH 7.2. Add 5 μL to each 500 μL sample. Incubate at 10 min at 20°C–25°C while shaking so that viscous samples become clear. Centrifuge at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to clear cell debris and take the supernatant for subsequent steps.",
    "Lyse cells at 4°C with probe sonication using a Fisherbrand Model 120 Sonic Dismembrator with the following settings: 1 s on, 1 s off pulses for 20 s at 75% amplitude.\nDetermine protein concentrations with BCA assay.\nIn a 96-well plate, pipet 5 μL of sample to each well and add 20 μL of DPBS buffer pH 7.2 for a 1:5 dilution. For triplicate measurements, add 16 μL sample to 64 μL DPBS buffer and then pipet 25 μL for each replicate.\nFor BSA protein standards, 25 μL of various protein concentration dilutions (3, 2.4, 1.9, 1.5, 1.2, 1, 0.8, 0.63, 0.5 mg/mL) made in PBS buffer was used.\nAdd 200 μL working reagent (A:B = 10 mL:0.2 mL) and shake for 30 min at 37°C in the dark.\nRead absorbance at 562 nm using a Tecan Infinite 200 PRO plate reader.\nAdjust lysate volumes with lysis buffer to achieve 2 mg/mL in 0.5 mL final volume.\nAlternatives: Other protein concentration determination assays, such as DC (detergent compatible) protein quantitation assay (Bio-Rad) can also be used.\nMix equal protein amounts of heavy and light cell lysates together to 1 mL final total volume.\nNote: In some cases, ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 50 min) can be used to separate the soluble and membrane fractions for each sample. The membrane fraction is solubilized with 0.5 mL of lysis buffer before step 19. Each fraction is carried through the protocol as separate samples.\nCritical: Steps 16–18 are instrumental to accurate quantitation with quantitative MS-based proteomics.\nPerform CuAAC chemistry reaction by treating samples with 41 μL click chemistry master mix.\nIncubate samples at 20°C–25°C in the dark for 1 h with end-to-end rotation using a rotisserie shaker (Thermo Scientific 415110)",
    "Note: The addition of organic solvents and click chemistry reagents will cause protein precipitation and, in some cases, loss of protein. Aggregation may cause complexes that are difficult to re-solubilize in future steps. Some tips are detailed in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nNote: For CuAAC chemistry with <100 μL volumes, use PCR tubes. For reactions of 0.5–1 mL volumes, use either 1.5 or 2 mL Eppendorf tubes. These reaction vessels reduce empty headspace during CuAAC chemistry reactions and thus reduce oxidation of reagents.\nTo confirm proper CuAAC chemistry, take 20 μL of the sample for in-gel fluorescence analysis. A control sample without probe treatment should be included to verify low background from CuAAC chemistry reagents. If not necessary, skip to step 21.\nAdd 7.5 μL of LDS loading buffer (4×) and 3 μL of reducing agent DTT (10×). Vortex and keep at 20°C–25°C for 10 min. Vortex again and centrifuge at 10,000 × g for 2 min.\nLoad 25 μL of sample to SDS-PAGE gel and run at 120 V for 1 h with 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) running buffer until 20 kDa band reaches the end of the gel.\nAfter electrophoresis, wash with deionized water 3× before scanning gels with a Typhoon FLA 9500 Biomolecular Imager (GE Healthcare) with 532 nm laser excitation, 580 nm emission, 1000 V, 100 μm resolution, and ≥575 nm long pass filter.\nGel scanning with fixation. Gels were fixed in 50% MeOH/7% Acetic acid for 15 min, then rinsed with 40% MeOH for at least 20 min before in-gel fluorescence scanning.\nNote: Gel fixation may eliminate background signal for imaging gels.",
    "To stain proteins, incubate gel with InstantBlue Coomassie blue reagent 14–18 h. Gels were de-stained for 1 h in water prior to scanning with Li-COR Odyssey CLx imaging system with the 700 nm channel in the Image Studio (4.0) software (LI-COR Biosciences).\nPerform protein precipitation with the leftover sample (∼0.5 mL) such that excess click chemistry reagents was removed (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/726-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. CuAAC chemistry reagent cleanup\nWorkflow describing steps for protein precipitation by methanol/chloroform and subsequent washes to remove CuAAC chemistry reagents.\nChill samples in ice and add ice-cold MeOH (0.5 mL) and cold CHCl3 (0.2 mL).\nNote: If the total volume of sample is ≥1 mL, transfer samples to a 15 mL falcon tube or a 5 mL Eppendorf tube. Scale all MeOH and CHCl3 volumes to achieve a 4:4:1 aqueous: MeOH:CHCl3 ratio for efficient precipitation.\nPause point: Proteins can be precipitated over 14–18 h at −20°C.\nVortex and add 0.5 mL of cold DPBS buffer.\nVortex again.\nCentrifuge to separate the phases (5000 × g, 10 min). A white protein disc should form between the two phases.\nCarefully remove liquid without disturbing protein disc before adding 1:1 MeOH: CHCl3 (0.5 mL). Centrifuge at 5000 × g, 10 min.\nRepeat wash in step 21e twice more.\nRe-suspend proteins by sonication in MeOH (2 mL).\nAdd CHCl3 (0.2 mL), vortex and pellet proteins by centrifugation (5000 × g, 10 min).\nNote: When washing away click chemistry reagents, note the loss of the bright pink color, leaving behind a white protein disc.\nAir dry proteins for approx. 2 min before re-suspension with 150 μL of 10% SDS solution. To re-suspend, mix well.",
    "After 5–10 min, add 0.5 mL of 8 M urea in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0 buffer. If necessary, perform sonication for protein re-suspension. Proteins should be re-solubilized at this step.\nReduce and alkylate proteins prior to enrichment.\nAdd dithiothreitol (DTT) to a final concentration of 10 mM (stock made in water) and incubate samples for 30 min at 37°C while shaking.\nAlkylate samples by adding iodoacetamide to a final concentration of 12.5 mM (stock made in deionized water) and incubate for 30 min at 20°C–25°C in the dark while shaking.\nNote: From our observations, protein coverage from MS-based proteomics is increased when reduction and alkylation is performed prior to enrichment, followed by on-bead digestion.\nEnrich protein samples using streptavidin agarose beads. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nDilute samples by addition of 11 mL of 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 buffer.\nPipet high capacity streptavidin agarose resin (120 μL of 50% slurry per each sample) to 15 mL falcon tube. Pre-wash with 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0 buffer (3 × 10 mL).\nAdd 100 μL of pre-washed streptavidin agarose resin (1:1 slurry in 50 mM Tris pH 8.0) to each sample. Incubate samples 14–18 h at 4°C with end-to-end rotation.\nWash enriched proteins on beads. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nCentrifuge samples at 1,500 × g, 3 min to isolate beads. Discard remaining buffer.\nAdd 0.1% SDS in DPBS (10 mL) and incubate with beads for 10 min with end-over-end rotation. Centrifuge beads with 1,500 × g, 3 min and discard wash buffer. Repeat this step two more times.\nAdd 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 (10 mL) and incubate with beads for 10 min with end-to-end rotation. Centrifuge beads with 1,500 × g, 3 min and discard wash buffer. Repeat this step two additional times.",
    "Note: For samples that are quantitated by TMT and not SILAC, use 50 mM HEPES pH 8.5 buffer for washes instead of Tris buffers. Amine-based buffers will interfere with TMT labeling reaction.\nAdd distilled water (10 mL) and incubate with beads for 10 min with end-to-end rotation. Centrifuge beads with 1,500 × g, 3 min and remove water.\nCritical: Washes in steps 24c and 24d are important for removal of SDS such that no complications arise from detergent in MS-based analysis.\nPerform on-bead digestion by adding trypsin mix to each sample.\nIncubate samples 14–18 h shaking at 37°C.\nNote: Again, for samples that are quantitated by TMT, use a HEPES buffer instead of Tris.\nIsolate digested peptides from beads by placing the entire solution on Micro Bio-Spin columns (Bio-Rad) and centrifuge (500 × g, 3 min) to collect eluant of digested peptides.\nWashes with MS-grade water (100 μL) were also collected and pooled with eluant.\nPooled eluant was dried to near completion using a speed vacuum system. Peptides were stored at −80°C.\nNote: At this point, the alternative approach with TMT requires additional steps for the labeling with TMT reagent. For peptide labeling with TMT10 reagent, please refer to the protocols detailed in (Xu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]) or with TMTpro reagent in (Li et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nPause point: Digested peptides can be stored at −80°C.\nLC-MS/MS analysis\nTiming: 3–4 days\nPeptides processed in previous steps are now analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and MS/MS spectra are analyzed for quantitative results.\nDissolve peptide samples in 1% TFA (40 μL) and desalt using C18 ZipTips (Millipore, 10 μL).\nActivate the resin of C18 ZipTip with 1:1 acetonitrile:water (3 × 10 μL).\nWash the resin with 1% TFA in water (3 × 10 μL).",
    "Load resin by pipetting in and out 30×, vortexing sample solution every 10×.\nWash resin with 1% TFA in water (3 × 10 μL)\nElute by pipetting 30× in 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% TFA.\nAlternatives: Microspin columns (The Nest Group) and the Resolvex A200 (Tecan) can also be used to de-salt peptide samples.\nOnce eluted, evaporate peptide solutions to near dryness using a speed vacuum system.\nPause point: Desalted peptides can be stored at −80°C until MS/MS analysis but is recommended to only leave the peptides at this stage for at most a week.\nReconstitute peptides in 7 μL of 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid.\nRun peptide samples by injecting 5 μL of sample through a trapping column (Acclaim PepMap C18 nanoViper LC column, 75 μm ID × 20 mm, 3 μm, 100 Å).\nRun captured peptides through a C18 column (EASY-Spray LC column, C18, 75 μm ID × 50 cm, 2 μm, 100 Å) using an EASY-nanoLC 1200 equipped with an autosampler. The nanoLC is coupled to a Thermo Q-Exactive or Q-Exactive HF mass spectrometer.\nTwo buffers, 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (B), were used in chromatography. Peptides were eluted using a linear gradient consisting of 1%–35% B at a flow rate of 300 nL/min over 120 min.\nStandard mass spectrometry parameters for SILAC-based approach are described in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_726_3.csv\nStandard mass spectrometry parameters for LC-MS/MS for TMTpro-based approach are described in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]. For TMTpro, the linear gradient increased from 5 to 30% B at a flow rate of 250 nL/min over 98 min, followed by linear increase of B to 45% in 20 min and then finally to 55% B over 10 min.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_726_4.csv",
