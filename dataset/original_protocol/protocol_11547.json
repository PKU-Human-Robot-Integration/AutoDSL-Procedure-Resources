    "This protocol was approved by Newcastle University's Faculty of Medical Sciences Ethics Committee (approval number 515_1).\n1. Preparation for the study\nBefore running the study, gather 20 small, easily identified/described objects, e.g.,\n\tA tea light\n\tA toy digger\n\tA toy frog\n\tA clothing hook\n\tA spoon\n\tA set of keys\n\tA button\n\tA lip balm\n\tA toy snowman\n\tA bottle cap\n\tA die\n\tA lighter\n\tA comb\n\tA wrist band\n\tA padlock\n\tA butterfly pin\n\tA ruler\n\tA guitar plectrum\n\tA battery\n\tA USB stick\nRandomly select 8 of these objects for the first session, and 8 for the second session. There should be 4 extra objects that are not used in either session. Once the objects have been selected, use the same objects in the same locations and in the same sessions for all participants.\nMake photographs of the 16 objects to be used. Make two sheets of these photographs: the first sheet for the first session (8 objects) and the second sheet for the second session (8 objects).\nPut the images of the objects on the sheet in the order the participants need to find them. Number the images to avoid any confusion. Figure 1 shows an example.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55646/55646fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1: Object identity sheets. These are the sheets that are placed next to the pile of 20 objects. The left-hand sheet is placed there in phase 1 and the right-hand sheet in phase 2. Participants are supposed to pick up the objects from the pile in the order indicated on the sheet. Note that in phase 2, all the objects from phase 1 have been collected up and added to the pile again, so that during phase 2, participants again search through a pile of 20 objects to start with.

Ideally, the room is an office with many things in it. The locations should be unambiguously describable by a person not actually in the room. Also, try and make the locations not purely associated with a clear object in the room, as this reduces spatial memory to object-object associations.\nAssign each object to one of the hiding locations, making sure that the locations used in the first and second session are randomly interspersed.\nMake sure that the lay-out of the room will remain the same for the duration of the study. In multi-use rooms, make sure that the room can be put back in the same way before each participant.\n2. Session 1\nBefore the participant arrives, put the 20 objects in a pile in a fixed location in the testing room, with the object picture sheet for session 1 next to it. The reason for having participants find the objects in a pile using the picture sheets is to force them to pay attention to the identity of the objects.",
    "When the participant arrives, first give them an information leaflet explaining the study, talk them through the study, and have them read and sign the consent forms.\nTake the participants to the door of the testing room and give instructions about what they will need to do in the room. The instructions can be modified to either induce intentional memorization or incidental memorization.\nFor intentional memorization, read these instructions to the participant:\n\t\t\"The purpose of this task is for you to hide some objects in a room and you will be asked to remember them later. You will be presented with a pile of objects on the desk. Next to the pile you will find a sheet with pictures of the 8 objects that you must hide during this task. At the bottom left of each picture there is a number indicating the order in which you must hide these objects.\n\t\tYou may only pick up and hide one object at a time. I will point to the location where you should hide each object. Once you enter the room you should start counting seconds out loud and continue doing that until you leave the room.\n\t\tLater in this study we will repeat this with different objects and different locations. After this you will be asked to remember what objects you hid, where you hid them and on which occasion. If you have any questions, please ask them now because you will not be able to once we enter the room. This is not a timed task, so please take as much time as you need.\"\nFor incidental memorization, read these instructions to the participant:",
    "\"The purpose of this task is to test your multi-tasking abilities. You will need to count seconds out loud, without slowing down or skipping numbers, while I try to distract you with objects to look for and place in different places around the room. I will record your voice for later analysis of your counting.\n\t\tFor the distractor, you will be presented with a pile of objects on the desk. Next to the pile you will find a sheet with pictures of the 8 objects that you must hide during this task. At the bottom left of each picture there is a number indicating the order in which you must hide these objects. You may only pick up and hide one object at a time. I will point to the location where you should hide each object. Once you enter the room you should start counting seconds out loud and continue doing that until you leave the room.\n\t\tLater in this study we will repeat this to test whether you get better with practice. If you have any questions, please ask them now because you will not be able to once we enter the room. This is not a timed task, so please take as much time as you need, but don't forget to keep the count going at a steady rate.\"\nTake the participant into the room and show the pile of objects. Have the participant find and take the first object. Indicate where the object needs to be placed, and have the participant place the object there.",
    "Then have the participant go back for the next object, and so on for all 8 objects on the picture sheet. The timing isÂ determined by the speed at which the participant finds and hides the objects. This typically takes no more than 2 minutes.\nAt the end of the session, take the participant out of the room.\n3. First break\nBetween session 1 and session 2, leave approximately 2 hours. Ask participants to do different tasks during this interval, or ask them to go away (e.g. to have lunch) and to come back at the appointed time.\nBefore the participant returns, remove all the hidden objects from the room and put them back in the pile.\nReplace the picture sheet with the picture sheet for session 2.\n4. Session 2\nRemind the participant of the instructions given before session 1.\nTake the participant into the room, and repeat section 2.4, but now with different objects and locations. Again, the timing is determined by the participant.\nTake the participant back out of the room.\n5. Second break\nAgain instruct the participant to come back 2 h later or run another battery of tests during this interval.\nRemove all objects from their hiding places. The room will not be needed again for this participant.\n6. Session 3\nIf the participants had been instructed for incidental memorization, debrief them now and tell them the real purpose of the task. Check the effectiveness of the deceit by asking the participants if they suspected the task was a memory task.",
    "Ask them to freely recall which objects they had hidden in which locations and on which of the two occasions. Ask them to write this all down in the order in which they remember them. Encourage them to recall any information they can, including incomplete information (like remembering an object, but not its location, etc.).\nGive the participants all the time they need to recall as much as they can. Allow them to draw a map or diagram if they so wish.\nAfter they have recalled all the information they can, ask them to complete the vividness scale and the task contemplation scale (Figure 2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55646/55646fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Subjective experience reporting. After reporting on their memory for objects, locations and phases, the participants are asked to complete these two scales, which report on the subjective experience of their memories (top scale) and on how much they actually rehearsed the material after each hiding phase.

Data extraction and analysis\nFor the scoring sheet, create a list of all 16 objects, and another list of all 16 locations.\nFor each object and location, determine whether it was remembered in combination with the correct session and location/object (respectively; What-Where-When)), whether in combination only with the correct session (only What-When or only Where-When) or only with the correct location/object (respectively; only What-Where), or whether it was recalled correctly, but without any correct combination (only What and only Where). The number of correctly recalled What-Where-When combinations and What-Where combinations should match for both lists.",
    "Analyze the full What-Where-When combinations first. Because there is a total of 16 combinations to be recalled, treat the number of actually correctly recalled combinations as coming from a binomial distribution (16 'yes-no' answers), which should be analyzed with a Generalized Linear Model, using a binomial distribution with log-link function.\nThen analyze the 3 incomplete combinations. To do this using the same analysis, analyze the total number of incompletely recalled combinations of each type out of the remaining number of combinations that were not correctly recalled as a complete what-where-when combination. For example, if a participant recalled 5 correct what-where-when combinations, then analyze incomplete combinations out of (16-5=) 11 possible incomplete combinations.\nAnalyze the number of objects or locations recalled without any combination in an analogous way out of the remaining combinations that have not yet been accounted for.\nSubscription Required.
