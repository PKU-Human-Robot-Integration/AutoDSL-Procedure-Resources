  "procedures": [
    "All animals were treated according to the Animal Research Ethics Committee (guidelines of the French Ministry of Agriculture). The protocol received the approval of the local ethics committee authorized for animal experimentations at the Paris Descartes University (registered number MESR 2035.02; Faculty of Medicine Paris Descartes, Paris, France).\n1. ADSC Culture and Labeling\nObtain confirmed ADSCs from a private institution. Culture allogenic ADSCs at 37 °C and 5% CO2 with alpha minimum essential medium including 10% fetal veal serum and 1% antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin).\nObtain around 24 x 106 ADSCs per animal using standard cell expansion procedures (37 °C and 5% CO2). Harvest the ADSCs using a standard trypsin solution (10 mL for a T150 dish). Perform cell counting with a hemocytometer.\nPerform cell labeling the day before transplantation using the PKH67 staining procedure described below.\n\tNOTE: The goal of the staining procedure is to allow cell tracking after transplantation.\n\t\nIn order to label 2 x 106 ADSCs, prepare Solution A (2 x 106 cells with 100 µL of Diluent C) and Solution B (4 µL of PKH67 with 1 mL of Diluent C).\nIncubate Solutions A and B for 2 min. Then, add 100 µL of fetal veal serum for 1 min.\nRinse the solution with 300 µL of citrated RPMI (298.5 µL of RPMI and 1.5 µL of citrate) and centrifuge at 1,500 x g for 5 min. Repeat this operation 2 times. Maintain the labeled cells and protect them from light until sheet construction.\n2. Double ADSC-sheet Construct\nThe day before transplantation, prepare a 12-well temperature-responsive cell culture dish with 4 mL per well of the cell culture medium, described above, before PKH-labeling. Seed the dish with 1.5 x 106 PKH-labeled cells per well and incubate for 12 h (37 °C and 5% CO2).",
    "On the day of transplantation, detach the confluent cell sheet by incubating the dish at room temperature for 30 min.\nGently aspirate one ADSC sheet with a pipette and layer it on a hydrophobic paper (1.5-cm diameter). Use this paper as a support membrane.\nGrasp another ADSC sheet and gently deposit it on top of the other one to obtain a double-layer construct.\nRepeat these procedures to obtain as many ADSC-sheet constructs as needed (4 per animal).\n3. Esophageal Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD)\nOn the day of transplantation, pre-medicate the animals with 10 mg/kg of intramuscular ketamine and induce them with 8 mg/kg of intravenous propofol. Then, perform endotracheal intubation and maintain the anesthesia with isoflurane 2.5% inhalation.\nOnce the animal is under general anesthesia, perform ESD with a gastroscope, a videoscope, and an electrosurgery unit.\n\t\nUse an endoscopic knife and soft coagulation to obtain hemi-circumferential dorsal marks ranging from 40 cm to 45 cm from the dental arch.\nInject a glycerol solution containing indigo carmine dye into the submucosal layer for the separation of the mucosal layer from the muscular layer.\nUse an endoscopic knife with endocut I mode to obtain circumferential incisions.\nUse an endoscopic knife with forced coagulation mode to perform the submucosal dissection, moving from the proximal incision to the distal incision.\nAt the end of the ESD procedure, observe the hemi-circumferential, 5 cm-long esophageal scar exposing the muscular layer.\n4. Endoscopic Transplantation\nImmediately after the ESD, endoscopically transplant animals with 4 double ADSC-sheet constructs.\n\t\nGrasp an ADSC-sheet construct with endoscopic forceps and protect it during transportation to the wound site by using a large, transparent endoscopic cap.\nApply the entire surface of the ADSC-sheet construct to the ulcer bed.",
    "Gently apply the ADSC-sheet construct for 10 min to obtain a complete and stable engraftment. For application, use endoscopic forceps or an endoscopic cap and apply the whole surface of the ADSC construct onto the esophageal submucosal layer.\nRepeat this procedure four times for each animal in order to obtain four transplanted and adherent double cell-sheet constructs.\n\tNOTE: The goal is to cover approximatively half of the wounded area.\n5. Postoperative Evaluation and Follow-up\nFor each animal, ensure post-ESD analgesia with the intramuscular injection of 0.2 mg/kg of morphine three times a day for the first day and with a 28-day anti-acid treatment of esomeprazole (40 mg/day). Perform antibiotic prophylaxis with amoxicillin (1 g/day) for 7 days. Authorize liquids on day 1 and solids on the following day.\nFollow up with animals for 28 days. Obtain daily clinical evaluations using Mellow Pinkas dysphagia scores16 and weight variation measurements.\nMultimodal stricture evaluation: under general anesthesia, on scheduled days 3, 14, and 28, perform a multimodal evaluation of stricture occurrence.\n\t\nPerform an endoscopic evaluation using scar description, stricture measurement, and paper support membrane detection. Measure the stricture using the gastroscope to cross through the stricture (the diameter of the gastroscope is 8 mm). Observe the scar, paying attention to the inflammatory aspect (mucosal erythema, mucosal edema, and mucosal spontaneous bleeding) and the absence or presence of the paper support membrane within the scar.\nApply pCLE green probe through the gastroscope operator canal directly into the scar bed. Search for a spontaneous and organized green signal compatible with PKH67-labeled ADSC-sheet construct engraftment.",
    "Perform 2 orthogonal incidences of baryte esophagography with a radiological hoop (front and left-sided incidences). Keep the tightest incidence for stricture evaluation (degree of stricture (%) = [1-(length of the short axis under stenosis/length of the normal axis under stenosis) x 100)])17,18.\nAnimal sacrifice.\n\t\nOn day 28, at the end of the follow-up period, perform the animal sacrifice. While the animal is still under general anesthesia, inject 100 mg/kg of intravenous phenobarbital. Ensure animal death using clinical examination for the absence of a heartbeat and of breathing movement.\nAfter a sternotomy and organ exposure, remove the esophagus from each sacrificed animal (with 10% buffered formalin fixation, paraffin embedding, and 4 µm-thick sections). Stain the slides with Hematoxylin and Saffron15. Digitalize the slides for computerized analysis and compare the animal groups15.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
