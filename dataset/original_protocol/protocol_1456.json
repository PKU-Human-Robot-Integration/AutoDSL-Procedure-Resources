    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSeeding of Vero cells\nTiming: 30 min work, 24 h incubation\nVero cells express the ACE2 receptor, which is targeted by SARS-CoV-2 via the virus’s spike proteins to infect cells (Fard et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Here, we describe the infection of Vero cells with SARS-CoV-2.\nUse Vero cells that are 80%–100% confluent, i.e., adherent cells are taking up 80%–100% of the surface of the flask. Aspirate and discard culture medium and wash the cells gently with PBS as described in step 4 above.\nDetach the cells from the flask.\nAdd 5 mL Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) to the flask and return the flask to 37°C for 5 min incubation.\nDeactivate Trypsin-EDTA by adding 5 mL DMEM #1 medium. Aspirate the cell suspension and transfer to a 15 mL falcon tube.\nAdd 5 mL DMEM #1 to the cells. Centrifuge cell suspension at 500 × g, at 18°C–22°C, and for 5 min.\nResuspend the cells in 5 mL DMEM #1 medium, count the cells using the trypan blue staining method and microscopy, and set cell concentration to 1×105 cells/mL.\nSeed 1×104 cells (100 μL) per well in flat-bottom 96-well cell culture plates and incubate the plates at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nCritical: The number of seeded Vero cells is critical and can be used as a modulator for the experiment (cf. troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting], problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] below). The cells should not be more than 80% confluent after 24 h incubation in the 96-well plate, so that control wells do not overgrowth during the later incubation step (3 days). Otherwise, overgrown cells start to detach and the distinction between cytopathic effect and cell detachment due to overgrowth becomes difficult or impossible.\nPreparation of serum samples and infection\nTiming: 3 h work, 3 days incubation",
    "The assay allows the detection of neutralizing antibodies in serum of convalescent or vaccinated persons. The sera are mixed with live virus, and the presence of neutralization antibodies will prevent viral infection of Vero cells. The virus neutralization can be measured by means of reduced visual cytopathic effect of virus on Vero cells. As non-qualified human sera may potentially contain human pathogens, their open handling of should take place in a biosafety hood with laminar air flow. The serum used in the following study was from the serum collection of the University Hospital Zurich (USZ) Dermatology Biobank, were collected under the General Ethical Consent of USZ, and they were stored at −20°C.\nPre-treat the serum samples at 56°C and for 30 min in Eppendorf tubes in a Thermoblock.\nNote: The heat treatment destroys complement proteins and has been recommended for virus neutralization assays. However, and as the result will demonstrate, the heat-treatment of sera is not mandatory. The current assay works with either heat-treated or non-treated sera (cf. Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] below).\nPrepare dilutions of serum samples.\nUse a multichannel pipette to prefill 96-well round-bottom plates with 108 μL DMEM #2 medium in row A and 60 μL DMEM #2 medium in rows B-H.\nMake a primary 10-fold dilution of serum samples by transferring 12 μL serum to each well of row A. Mix the samples in row A by aspirating and releasing 60 μL of the samples five times using the multichannel pipette.\nMake 2-fold dilutions of the serum samples by transferring 60 μL of the serum solution in row A to the medium-containing row B. Replace the pipette tips and mix the samples in row B by aspirating and releasing 60 μL as above.",
    "Proceed the serial 2-fold dilution down the plate for a total of eight dilutions (D10, D20, D40, D80, D160, D320, D640, and D1280), and replace the tips between each row.\nDiscard 60 μL from the last row so that the final volume of each well is 60 μL. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] illustrates the plate preparation procedure.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1000-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Preparation of 96-well plate for serum dilution and virus neutralization\nSerum samples in tubes are added to 96-well plates with culture medium (DMEM #2). Two-fold serial dilutions thereof are made using a multichannel pipette, so that samples ranges from a 10-fold to a 1280-fold dilution prior to addition of virus. As the volumes of serum solution and virus solution are the same, there is an additional two-fold dilution of the serum samples upon adding virus (new dilution: 20-fold–2560-fold).\nNote: Different starting dilution may be chosen, e.g., D5 or D100, and different serial dilutions variants may be used, e.g., 3-, 5- or 10-fold dilutions, depending on expected strength of the serum neutralization, and the expected range of neutralization titers between serum samples.\nSeal the 96-well plates with the diluted serum samples with a lid and a plastic foil, and store the plates at 4°C until the next steps.",
    "Critical: Each step from now on must be performed in a BSL3 laboratory according to internal guidelines. Only trained and experienced personnel should handle life virus to avoid non-intended contamination and infections with SARS-CoV-2, which is stored at −20°C within the BSL3 lab. In the BSL3 lab, it is mandatory to wear personal protective equipment, and effort should be put into organizing the work within the lab and within the biosafety hood. In the described protocol, two persons were always present in the BSL3 lab on days 1 and 5. This enabled one person to work efficiently in the biosafety hood while the second person provided materials. Moreover, it is often a safety guideline to always have at least two persons in a BSL3 lab.\nThaw a frozen aliquot of the virus suspension by leaving it in the biosafety hood for approximately 15 min. Prepare the targeted concentration (typically in plaque-forming units per mL; in the example below, with 100 PFU infection, a concentration of 1666.7 PFU/mL is required) of the virus by pipetting an accurate aliquot thereof into a 50 mL falcon tube prefilled with DMEM #3. Transfer the whole virus suspension into a reagent reservoir.\nAspirate 60 μL of the virus suspension using a multichannel pipette and transfer the suspension to the row A on the plates with the diluted serum samples (from step 7). Repeat the procedure for the rows B-H, and replace the pipette tips between each row. Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] illustrates the plate preparation procedure.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 1 h.",
    "Infect cells by transferring 100 μL of the serum-virus solution to each well of the plates with the adherent Vero cells (from step 4); make sure to re-suspend the serum-virus samples by pipetting up and down twice before the transfer. Label the plates and lids for recognition.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C in a humidified and 5% CO2 atmosphere for 3 days.\nCritical: Include non-infected controls and controls with naïve non-neutralizing serum. This is important as to be able to distinguish between true cytopathic effect and other unforeseen cell-culture effects such as mechanical disruption of the cell layer that may influence the assessment of neutralization.\nNote: The exact incubation time depends on the starting number of Vero cells, viral titers, and the strength of neutralization. It is recommended to try different incubation times (typically 2–4 days). Moreover, the optimal number of viral particles used may depend on the particular virus isolation serotype and the genetic variant of the viral strains. As a rule, the cytopathic effect increases with time and initial viral dose. The current protocol with the given SARS-CoV-2 strain was optimized for infections with 100 PFU per well, hence, a virus suspension containing 1666.7 PFU/ml was prepared. The concentration of cytopathic virus is by standard defined by their property to create plaques (holes) in a confluent cell layer of cells when these are overlaid with a gel (Baer and Kell-Hall, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). The virus load should be optimized in each lab and for each viral strain.\nStaining of infected cells\nTiming: 2 h",
    "After three days of incubation, several rounds of infection should have produced visible cytopathic effects (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Remaining live virus is neutralized by formaldehyde. Vero cell detachment can be observed directly on plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) or under microscope, but to increase contrast, the cells are stained with crystal violet.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1000-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. In-process visual control of infections and neutralization\nAfter 3 days of incubation of Vero cells with SASR-COV-2 virus, visual control of cultures will enable to distinguish infection from non-infections (or successful neutralization).\n(A) Side view of four plates prior to inactivation of virus with formaldehyde. The upper two plates show wells with healthy cells (no infection) as indicated by the red color of the culture, while the lower two plates show infected cells as indicated by the yellow color of the cultures.\n(B) Culture after inactivation with formaldehyde (step 10). Wells with infected cells are more yellow. Wells with non-infected cells are redder.\n(C) The discharged culture wash (step 11) of plates with healthy cells is clear (left tube), as cells maintain adhered on the plate. The discharged culture wash of infected cells is more turbid (right tube) due to detachment of cell from plate.\n(D) The same plate as in B after staining (steps 12–15). Note that yellowish wells in B show non-confluence cell layers (cytotoxicity) in D, while the reddish well is B show confluent cell layers in D.\nAdd 10% formaldehyde solution to a reagent reservoir (10 mL per plate is required) using a serological pipette. By using a multichannel pipette, transfer 100 μL/well to the infected plates in order to fixate cells and to inactivate virus.\nIncubate the plates at 18°C–22°C for 15 min.",
    "Discard supernatant into a reagent reservoir by using a multichannel pipette. Wash the plates with 100 μL/well PBS and discard wash solution, again using the multichannel pipette. Of note, cytotoxicity can be observed by having more cells in the wash solution (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). These are cells that were detached from the plate due to infection.\nTo stain cells, add 50 μL/well of 1% Gram Hucker’s crystal violet solution by using a multichannel pipette.\nIncubate the plates at 18°C–22°C for 15 min.\nRemove staining solution using a multichannel pipette and discharge waste into a reagent reservoir. Wash the plates with 100 μL/well PBS, and discard wash solution into the reagent reservoir.\nRemove residual washing solution by tapping the plates top-down and gently on a tissue paper.\nDisinfect the plates with lids using 70% ethanol in water. Only now, the plates can be taken out of the biosafety hood.\nCollect all the liquid wastes into 50 mL falcons and close with lids.\nPlace the stained plates upside down on a luminous board, a light table, or similar. Make photographs of the plates from underneath (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D) as well as one matched photograph of the labeled lid for identification of the plate organization.\nAnalyze cytopathic effect and note the serum dilutions where 50% or more of the cell layer is harmed or detached.\nDry plates top-down at 18°C–22°C overnight or longer.\nNote: All liquid waste from step 8–15 is collected in Gigasept® for decontamination and then discharged in bags together with the solid waste. Finally, all waste is autoclaved. The waste management in different BSL3 labs may vary, and typically defined by the pathogen (here, SARS-CoV-2), and not by the chemicals. The BSL3 waste management is always strongly regulated by law and typically ISO certified."
