    "Poly-L-lysine coating of tissue culture treated 96-well platesTo coat the plates, transfer 100 μl of 0.01% poly-L-lysine to each well using a multichannel micropipette.Incubate overnight in the tissue culture incubator at 37 °C.The next day, before the dissection, aspirate the coating solution using a vacuum-connected Pasteur pipet (or a 200 μl multichannel micropipette) and rinse three times with 100 μl PBS.Remove the final wash and let the plate dry in the biological safety cabinet.Note: It is also possible to purchase and use 96-well plates pre-coated by the manufacturer, to store at room temperature. We did not observe any difference between data from cells plated in 96-well plates pre-coated in our laboratory or by the manufacturer.Preparation of cotton-plugged, fire-polished Pasteur pipetUsing a Bunsen burner, polish the cotton plugged Pasteur pipet extremity by holding the pipet oriented with the capillary tube in the flame for 2-3 sec, rotating rapidly. Check the opening of the capillary tube, ensuring that the edge is round and the hole is not too small. If the hole is too small, discard the pipet, as it will sheer neurites during the trituration (Figure 1).Autoclave the Pasteur pipets to sterilize before use.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170814/20170814230219_5546.jpgFigure 1. Fire-polished pipettes. A. Cotton-plugged, fire-polished pipettes; B.

Same as in B.Isolation of mouse primary cortical neurons (Figure 2)Note: To avoid contamination, sterilize instruments for use during the preparation. Between each step, tools can be kept in 70% ethanol or sterilized by heat in a Germinator.Primary cortical neurons are isolated from E15.5 mouse embryos of pregnant mice.",
    "Before starting, prepare plating medium required during the procedure and, pre-warm at 37 °C by incubation in a water bath. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170814/20170814230508_6114.jpgFigure 2. Schematic of primary cortical neuron isolationEuthanize pregnant mice with CO2 followed by cervical dislocation. Note: This is one example of proper procedure, each investigator should follow his or her approved IACUC protocol. Lay the mouse on her back and clean the abdominal surface with 70% ethanol to sterilize the area.Using microscissors, make a vertical incision in the abdominal muscles to open the abdominal cavity of the mouse. Using forceps, carefully remove the embryonic sacs and rinse them in cell culture medium (DMEM, ice cold, no additives). Place the embryonic sacs in a 10 cm dish containing 10 ml of ice-cold DMEM.Using microscissors and forceps, carefully open the embryonic sacs, remove the embryos and transfer to a 10 cm dish containing 10 ml of ice-cold DMEM.Note: Steps C6 to C10 are performed one embryo after another. Place the forceps near the back of the embryos skull and pull forward toward the nose.Place the forceps on either side of the head, beneath the brain, and carefully lift the brain out of the skull (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Removal of the brain from the skull Transfer the brains to a 10 cm dish containing 10 ml of ice-cold Hibernate E.Transfer brains to single droplets of Hybernate E in 10 cm dishes under the dissecting microscope for easy access.Under a dissecting microscope, use forceps to carefully peel away the meninges from the upper surface of each brain hemisphere. The cortex will fall away from the brain after the meninges are removed (Figure 3B).Using the forceps, carefully separate the cortices from the brain.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170814/20170814230909_2779.jpgFigure 3.

    "Cortex from one hemisphere following removal of the meninges; C. Cortex from one hemisphere (dotted line). Area of cortex to be transferred to papain/DNase (solid line).Transfer the upper, outer portion of the cortices (Figure 3C) into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 1 ml of pre-warmed papain/DNase solution and close the tube while collecting the remainder of the cortices to keep away as much contamination as possible. Incubate the tube open, in a sterile 10 cm dish for 30 min at 37 °C to dissolve the tissue. This allows the tissue to breathe while keeping it in a sterile environment.Note: Perform all the following steps in a biological safety cabinet to avoid any contamination. Place the tube upright for a few minutes to allow the cortices to sediment at the bottom of the tube. Without disturbing the cortices, slowly and carefully remove the papain/DNase solution using a 1 ml micropipette (be sure to remove as much papain/DNase solution as possible) and add 1 ml of plating medium.Dissociate the cells with a gentle and consistent motion of pipetting up and down several times through a cotton-plugged, fire-polished Pasteur pipet using a pipet-aid adjusted to the lowest speed. It is important to avoid the formation of bubbles. Triturate the tissue until the medium turns slightly cloudy, and no remaining tissue clumps are visible (Video 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Trituration of cortices Transfer the cells to a 15 ml conical tube and add 4 ml of plating medium. To ensure small clumps of cells are broken up, perform an additional trituration by gently and consistently pipetting up and down several times through a cotton-plugged, fire-polished Pasteur pipet using a pipet-aid adjusted to the lowest speed.",
    "Let the solution sit for 2 min to allow any debris to settle to the bottom of the 15 ml tubeTransfer the supernatant containing the single cell neuronal suspension to a new 15 ml tube. Transfer a small drop of cells to a tissue culture treated dish and, using a tissue culture microscope (10x magnification), observe if there is a single cell suspension (Figure 4). If not, perform another trituration using a cotton-plugged, fire-polished Pasteur pipet, as previously described.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170814/20170814231342_2055.jpgFigure 4. Primary cortical neuron morphology. Phase contrast images (4x objective) of mouse primary cortical neurons showing the neuronal morphology acquisition over time.Using trypan blue stain solution and a hemocytometer, count the live cells present in the cell suspension. Add 10 μl of cells to 90 μl of trypan blue stain solution and mix gently by pipetting. Transfer a 10 μl aliquot to the hemocytometer and count the live cells from all four quadrants of the hemocytometer. Average the four numbers and multiply by 1 x 105. This number corresponds to the number of cells per ml of medium. On average, each pup will yield ~5-10 x 106 cells.Transfer the cells to a 50 ml conical tube and adjust the density of viable cells with pre-warmed plating medium to 1 x 106 cells/ml. For example, if the cell concentration is 5 x 106 cells/ml in 5 ml, add 20 ml of plating medium to obtain a final cell concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml in 25 ml final volume.Close and invert the tube to ensure a thorough mixture of the cell suspension. Transfer the cells to a 50 ml reagent reservoir. Using a 200 μl multichannel micropipette, transfer 100 μl of cells (1 x 105 cells) to each well of a poly-L-lysine pre-coated 96-well plate.",
    "To seed an equal number of cells in each well, mix the cells in the reservoir by pipetting up and down before each transfer into the 96-well plate.Incubate the plates overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a tissue culture incubator.The following day, using a multichannel micropipette, slowly add 100 μl of feeding medium (containing anti-mitotics) to each well to prevent the growth of non-neuronal cells. Be careful not to disturb the cells.Every 3-4 days, replace half of the volume of media with freshly prepared feeding medium. Using a multichannel micropipette, slowly remove 100 μl of medium from each well without touching the bottom of the well to avoid disturbing the cells. Very gently, add back 100 μl of freshly prepared and pre-warmed feeding medium without disturbing the cells.Store in the tissue culture incubator at 37 °C. Repeat feeding step as necessary.Treatment of primary neurons with oligonucleotide therapeuticsNote: Oligonucleotides are stored at -20 °C. Prior to any experiment, thaw the compounds on ice. This procedure is performed in a biological biosafety cabinet. Prepare the oligonucleotide dilutions in feeding medium. Carefully design your plate map to include the oligonucleotides of interest (hsiRNATarget), the non-targeting control (hsiRNANTC) and the untreated cells. Compound is prepared at two times the final concentration so that 50 µl compound solution can be added to 50 µl of the conditioned medium. Be sure to prepare enough compound to treat cells in the number of desired replicates. For the purposes of this protocol, we describe a preparation for three replicate wells per compound and a final concentration of 1.5 µM hsiRNA.In a deep 96-well plate, prepare a 2x hsiRNA master mix by diluting the stock hsiRNA in fresh feeding medium containing anti-mitotics to a final concentration of 3 µM (two times the final concentration of 1.",
    "5 µM) in a final volume of 200 µl. Mix gently up and down with the micropipette. Using a micropipette, gently remove the entire conditioned medium from the neurons and immediately add back 50 µl of conditioned medium to each well (you can combine the conditioned medium into a sterile reagent reservoir for easy pipetting back into the plate). Only remove medium from one or two rows at a time to prevent the cells from drying. To avoid disturbing the cells, pipet down the medium slowly with the tips touching the edge of the wells. This step is intended to control for any evaporation that may have happened during incubation at 37 °C, and to ensure that all cells are treated with the same concentration of hsiRNA. Using a multichannel micropipette and clean tips for each row, transfer 50 μl of the 2x hsiRNA master mix from the deep 96-well plate into each of the replicate wells of the cell culture plate for a final volume of 100 µl per well. Incubate the plate in a tissue culture incubator at 37 °C. For a one week long incubation, feed the cells once with 100 µl freshly prepared feeding medium (3-4 days after treatment). Then lyse the cells one week after treatment. This step ensures that no hsiRNA will be removed from the wells during the experiment. For longer term experiments, where cells need to be fed more than once, remove 100 µl of conditioned medium from the 200 µl in the cell culture plate and add back 100 µl of fresh medium. Continue this pattern of feeding every 3-4 days.mRNA quantificationmRNA is quantified using the QuantiGene 2.0 bDNA Assay (Affymetrix). All the volumes used in the following steps are for one plate.",
    "Prepare all the solutions used for this procedure in clean 50 ml conical tubes using clean serological pipettes.In a 50 ml conical tube, prepare the diluted lysis mixture (DLM; 1:2 v/v, lysis mixture/water, e.g., 10 ml lysis mixture:20 ml water) complemented with 100 μl of 50 μg/μl Proteinase K (provided with the kit) and pour it into a 50 ml reservoir. Diluted lysis mixture should be prepared fresh for every experiment. Storing the diluted lysis mixture in the fridge will cause precipitate to form.Remove all growth medium from the plate.Using a 300 μl multichannel pipette, add 250 μl of diluted lysis mixture in each well of the 96-well culture plate. There is enough lysate to perform the quantification of the target and the control mRNA.To lyse the cells, gently pipette up and down avoiding the formation of bubbles. Use clean tips between each row.Incubate for 30 min at 55 °C in a forced air oven. Using a 300 μl multichannel pipette setup at 150 µl, mix the cell lysate thoroughly by gently pipetting up and down avoiding the formation of bubbles. Add 20 μl of probe set, diluted according to the kit protocol to each well of the capture plate (provided with the kit).Using a 100 μl multichannel pipette, transfer the appropriate amount of each lysate to the capture plate. Avoid touching the bottom of the coated plate. For background wells, simply add DLM (no Proteinase K) instead of cell lysate. Prior to testing a new gene using the QuantiGene 2.0 kit, you will need to validate the correct volume of lysate to obtain the proper degree of luminescent signal (at least a 5 fold signal to noise ratio, and within the linear range of detection for the plate reader you are using).",
    "This can be tested by measuring signal from different amounts of lysate (between 5 and 80 μl) and plotting the corresponding luminescent values. Housekeeping and target genes may require different volumes of lysate in the same experiment.Top off each well to 100 μl with DLM (no Proteinase K). Seal the plate very tightly with an aluminum plate seal (provided with the kit) and centrifuge for 1 min at 240 x g at room temperature.Incubate over night at 55 °C in a forced air oven.The next day perform signal amplification as recommended by Affymetrix. Read the luminescence using a microplate reader setup for a 200-500 msec reading time per well. Analyze the data."
