    "1. Enrichment of Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells from Adult Whole Blood\nNOTE: Hematopoietic progenitor cells or CD34+ cells can be purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from a variety of sources including cord blood, leukapheresis material and whole blood using density gradient centrifugation based methods. The method listed here uses whole blood as an example.\nIsolation of PBMCs from Whole Blood:\n\t\nAdd 4.5 ml of lymphocyte separation medium to the SepMate tube by pipetting it through the central hole of the insert.\nDilute the blood sample with an equal volume of sterile DPBS containing 2% human serum (v/v). For example, dilute 5 ml of sample with 5 ml of DPBS + 2% human serum.\nAdd the diluted sample by pipetting it down the side of the tube. Take care not to pour the sample directly through the central hole.\nCentrifuge at 1,200 x g for 10 min at RT.\nCarefully remove the supernatant above the PMBC layer.\nCollect the PBMC layer (cloudy) into a new tube.\nAdd 15 ml of Dulbecco’s Phosphate-buffered Saline (DPBS) containing 2% human serum into the tube and centrifuge at 150 x g for 10 min at RT with the brake off.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 15 ml of DPBS containing 2% human serum. Count the number of cells.\nCentrifuge at 690 x g for 10 min at RT. Remove all the supernatant from the tube.\nResuspend cells at 1 x 107 cells per 15 ml of Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium (IMDM) containing 1% antibiotics (v/v) and 10% human serum (v/v).\nIncubate the cells O/N at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator before isolating CD34+ cells.\nPositive Selection of CD34+ cells from PBMCs using CD34 MultiSort Kit:",
    "NOTE: Work fast and use pre-cooled solutions to make cells cold and prevent capping of antibodies on the cell surface and non-specific cell labeling per the kit instruction.\n\t\nCollect all PMBCs in a 50 ml tube and count the number of total cells in the medium.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 10 min. Remove all the supernatant completely.\nResuspend up to 108 cells per 300 µl in bead buffer (DPBS containing 0.5% human serum (v/v) and 2 mM EDTA).\nAdd 100 µl of FcR Blocking Reagent and add 100 µl of CD34 MultiSortMicroBeads.\nMix well and incubate for 30 min in the refrigerator (2 - 8 °C).\nWash cells by adding 2 ml of bead buffer per 108 cells and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at RT. Remove supernatant completely.\nResuspend up to 108 cells in 500 µl of buffer.\nPlace MACS LS column in the magnetic field of a MACS Separator and prepare column by rinsing with 3 ml of bead buffer.\nApply cell suspension onto the center of the column. Unlabeled cells will flow through which can be collected if preferred.\nWash column three times with 3 ml of bead buffer.\nRemove the column from the separator and place it on a 15 ml tube.\nAdd 5 ml of bead buffer onto the column and immediately flush out the magnetically labeled cells by pushing the plunger into the column.\nAdd 20 µl of MultiSort Release Reagent per 1 ml of cell suspension. Mix well and incubate for 10 min in the refrigerator (2 - 8 °C).\nAdd 1 - 2 ml of bead buffer per 107 cells and centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 10 min at RT. Remove supernatant completely.",
    "Resuspend cells in 50 µl of bead buffer per 107 cells.\nAdd 30 µl of MultiSort Stop Reagent per 107 cells and incubate for 15 min in the refrigerator.\nAdd 5 ml of bead buffer and centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 10 min at RT. Discard the supernatant.\n2. Derivation of Induced Neural Stem Cells from CD34+ Cells\nCD34+ cells culture:\n\tNOTE: Freshly prepared medium should be used within 7 days when stored in the refrigerator. Significant CD34 cells loss could be observed after 24 hr but the significant proliferation of cells should be noticeable, especially after day 5. If the cell number decreases continuously or there is no proliferation, it implies either bad quality of medium or CD34 cells and the cells should not be used for next step.\n\t\nResuspend and culture CD34+ cells in CD34 maintaining medium (StemSpan SFEM medium containing human thrombopoietin (TPO, 100 ng/ml), fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt-3) ligand (100 ng/ml) and stem cell factor (SCF, 100 ng/ml), interleukin-6 (IL-6, 20 ng/ml) and interleukin-7 (IL-7, 20 ng/ml)) in a 24-well plate (up to 3 x 105/well in 1 ml of medium per well) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator.\nAfter 24 hr, collect the floating cells and centrifuge the cells at 110 x g at RT to get rid of any attached cells and cell debris. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 ml of fresh CD34 maintaining medium and seed in a new 24-well plate (up to 1 x 105/well) at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator for 5 additional days.\nReplace half of the medium every the other day by carefully aspirating the top half of supernatant while the CD34+ cells are floating on the bottom of the wells (Figure 1A).\nSendai virus transfection:",
    "On day 5, collect CD34 cells and centrifuge the cells at 170 x g for 10 min at RT. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in fresh medium at 1 x 105/well in a 24-well plate in 1 ml of medium.\nThaw a cytotune-iPS Sendai reprogramming kit by first immersing the bottoms of the tubes in a 37 °C water bath for 10 sec and then completely thaw at RT. Briefly centrifuge the tubes and put them on ice. Prepare the Sendai virus mixture by mixing the recommended volume of each virus listed on the Certificate of Analysis (COA) for the corresponding lot. MOI 15 is recommended.\nAdd Sendai virus mix to each well of CD34 cells. Mix the wells by gently shaking. Incubate the cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator.\nObserve the transfection efficiency after 24 hr. Notice that cell aggregates and sphere formation are indicators for successful transfection (Figure 1B).\nChange half of the medium by carefully transferring the top half of the medium to another well. If there are cell spheres in the new well, add the same amount of fresh medium.\nChange medium every the other day by repeating step 2.2.6.\nNeural stem cell induction:\n\tNOTE: Depending on cell conditions, about 5 or 7 days after transfection, monolayer adherent cells will reach 30 - 50% confluence (Figure 1C).\n\t\nRemove the supernatants containing floating cells and spheres and then add 1 ml of neural progenitor medium (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium: Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12), containing 1x N2 supplement, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1% (v/v) antibiotics, 20 ng/ml of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and 20 ng/ml of epidermal growth factor (EGF)) into the adherent cells.",
    "Optionally, dissociate the cell spheres by gently pipetting and centrifuge the cells at 170 x g for 10 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 ml of neural progenitor medium in a new 24-well plate coated with matrigel per instruction as back up.\nChange the medium every other day till the cells reach 60 - 80% confluent, usually after 1 week.\nDiscard the supernatant and add in 1 ml of neural stem cell medium (serum free medium, NSC SFM). Dissociate the cells by using a cell scraper followed by very gentle pipetting.\nRemove the cells and seed all of them into one well of a 6-well plate. Add another 1 ml of neural stem cell medium to make 2 ml media for each well. Incubate the cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 incubator.\nChange medium every the other day.\nWhen cells reached 60% confluence, dissociate and replate the cells at 1:3 ratio following the steps in 2.3.4 and 2.3.6.\nFreezing of neural stem cells:\n\t\nPrepare neural stem cell freezing medium by adding 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) into the neural stem cell medium. Keep the freezing medium on ice.\nDissociate the cells in a 6-well plate, using cell scraper followed by gently pipetting. Count the cells. Centrifuge the cells at 170 x g for 10 min at RT.
