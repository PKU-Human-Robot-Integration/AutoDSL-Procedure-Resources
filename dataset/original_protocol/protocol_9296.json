    "1. Plasmid preparation for electroporation\nThe DNA concentration required for electroporation is 5μg/μl.  This typically requires the desired plasmids to be amplified using a Maxi-prep (Qiagen) or equivalent method followed by a purification and concentration of the DNA to the working amount.  The following steps describe the preparation of DNA to the working amount.\nAliquot 100 μg of DNA (from Maxi-prep or equivalent) and dilute the volume to 100 μL for ease of manipulation.\nAdd phenol; the amount of phenol should be calculated to obtain an approximately 60% DNA/volume ratio (μg DNA:total volume) i.e.:  100 μg DNA (in 100 μL) plus 67 μL phenol (100 μg:167 μL).  Mix thoroughly; do not pipette up and down as this may cause excessive shearing of the DNA.\nSpin the DNA for 5 minutes at 14000 RPM at room temperature.\nCollect supernatant and add chloroform using the same DNA:total volume ratio in step 1.2; mix as described in step 1.2 and spin at 14000 RPM for 5 minutes at room temperature.\nCollect the supernatant, add 10 % supernatant volume of 3 M sodium acetate to the DNA solution, mix gently and add 2.5 X the supernatant volume of 100% ethanol.  Mix by inversion.  DNA should precipitate out of solution during the mixing.\nSpin the DNA at 4°C for 10 minutes at 14000 RPM.\nRinse with 350 μl of 70 % ethanol, spin at 14000 RPM for 5 minutes at 4°C.\nAir dry the pellet then dissolve the DNA in 1 X PBS (Cell biology grade) to 5μg/μL.  Do not overdry the sample as this will make it very difficult to dissolve into PBS.\nAdd Fast Green dye (10% stock) to the DNA solution, the final concentration of dye is 0.1%, to act as an injection tracer.\n2. Subretinal injection of DNA",
    "The following steps are performed with the assistance of a\nstereomicroscope. Once practiced the process of eye opening, incision,\nand injection takes less than 1.5 minutes which is not enough time for\na properly anesthetized pup to recover. Using a sharp 30-gauge needle,\ncarefully open the eye by cutting along the fused junctional\nepithelium (Fig. 1C). Do not apply excessive force as this may result\nin cutting of the underlying eye. Avoid cutting beyond the range of\nthe eyelid junction as this will result in bleeding which can obscure\nthe injection.\nAnesthetize the newborn mice on ice for several minutes (Fig. 1A), do not bury pups in the ice as this may result in mortality. The\nlength of time on ice is variable from pup to pup, typically 5 minutes is sufficient but mice should be carefully monitored as individuals\nmay respond very quickly or may require longer exposure to ensure appropriate anesthesia. Conduct a paw pinch with hemostats to check\nfor withdrawal reflex.\nIn order to facilitate the injection of DNA to the subretinal space the eye must first be opened.  Swab the eye to be injected with a 70% isopropyl alcohol prep (Tyco healthcare) and identify the fused junctional epithelium where the two eyelids come together (Fig. 1B).\nUsing a sharp 30-gauge needle, carefully open the eye by cutting along the fused junctional epithelium (Fig. 1C).  Do not apply excessive force as this may result in cutting of the underlying eye.  Avoid cutting beyond the range of the eyelid junction as this will result in bleeding which can obscure the injection.",
    "To facilitate penetration of the eye by the blunt ended injection needle use the tip of a 30-guage needle make a small incision in the sclera near the junction with the cornea (Fig. 1E).  Do not penetrate too deeply as this may result in a puncture of the lens.\nDraw 0.3 μl of DNA solution into a 33 gauge blunt ended injection needle using the syringe gradients to measure the volume individually for each injection (needle outer diameter 0.52 mm, inner diameter 0.13 mm; Exmire microsyringe; Ito corp).  Insert the needle into the incision until the resistance of the opposing scleral wall is felt.  Be careful to avoid penetrating the lens as the needle is passed through the vitreal chamber (Fig. 2B).\nSlowly inject 0.3 μl of DNA solution into the subretinal space using the index finger or thumb to depress the syringe plunger.  The experimenter must be careful to control the speed of plunger depression so that the rate at which the DNA solution is injected into the subretinal space does not outpace the rate at which the DNA solution spreads within subretinal space (Fig. 2C).  The DNA solution is viscous so it is important that the needle is not pressed too tightly against the opposing scleral wall as this may result in the DNA not being injected or not spreading evenly.  A successful injection will result in an even spread of DNA solution in a portion of the subretinal space.  Regions of retina with and without underlying green tracer should be evident when rotating the injected animal.\n3. Electroporation",
    "Electroporation is performed using a 10 mm diameter tweezer electrode (Model #522; BTX Instruments).  Soak the tweezer electrode in PBS in order to maximize electrical conductivity from the electrode to the animal and place the head of the injected pup between the electrodes with the injected eye adjacent to the positive pole electrode and the non-injected eye adjacent to the negative pole electrode (Fig. 3B).\nApply five square pulses using a pulse generator: each pulse is 80 volts and 50 milliseconds in duration with a 950 millisecond interval between pulses.\nThe electroporated pups must now be warmed until they recover from the ice anesthesia.  This can be done by placing the pups under a warming lamp or on top of a slide warmer.  If using a slide warmer ensure that an appropriate pad is placed between the metal surface and the recovering pup.  Upon recovery return the electroporated pups to their mother.\n4. Preparation of eyes for analysis\nThe time of harvesting and analysis of the electroporated retinas is performed subject to the objectives of the experiment.  GFP expression can be grossly visualized 3 days after electroporation.  For cryoembedding and sectioning proceed as follows.\nSacrifice electroporated animals at the desired timepoint.  Disect out the electroporated eye and fix in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4°C for 50 minutes.\nCarefully remove the retina from the eye by micro-dissecting away the sclera, cornea, lens, choroid and retinal pigmented epithelium.  The dissected retinas may be analyzed under fluorescence to grossly determine the efficiency of electroporation.  Transfer the retinas to 30% sucrose solution overnight at 4°C.\nFreeze retinas into O.C.T. cryo-embedding media (Sakura Finetek USA) and store at -80°C.  Retinas may now be sectioned on a cryotome and captured onto glass slides.\n5. Representative Results:",
    "Examples of P0 neonatal retinas electroporated with a pCAG-EGFP expression plasmid are presented at 3 days following electroporation (P3) and 14 days following electroporation (P14) in figure 4.  The area of retinal tissue electroporated is variable from experiment to experiment depending on the extent of tissue damage incurred during the injection and evenness of the spread of the DNA solution into the subretinal space.  Typically 90-100% of electroporated retinas will feature cells that have successfully incorporated and expressed the introduced plasmid.  However, when factoring in tissue morphology and electroporation efficiency only 40-60 % of electroporated retinas will be suitable for comparative analysis.  Rosette formation and retinal detachment at the site of needle penetration is nearly always observed and this region should not be used for analysis.  Successful DNA spread during the microinjection results in efficiently electroporated tissue lateral to the site of needle penetration free from rosettes and detachment.  Gliosis is also an important experimental concern and nearly always occurs at the site of needle penetration.  However, as with rosette formation and retinal detachment, gliosis is typically not significant in laterally electroporated tissue.  Immunohistochemical markers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) can be utilized to determine whether levels of reactive gliosis in analyzed regions fall within acceptable thresholds.  Sectioned retinas demonstrating that the morphology of the electroporated retina remains intact and that EGFP expression labels individual electroporated cells are presented.  Examples 3 days following a P0 electroporation (Fig. 4A-C) and 14 days following a P0 electroporation (Fig. 4D-F) are presented.",
    "In P3 retinas the majority of electroporated cells are located in the neuroblastic layer (NBL) of the retina, and do not demonstrate distinct morphological characteristics of any of the differentiated neural or glial cells of the retina (Fig. 4B, C).  By P14 electroporated cells can be found in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) and the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the retina.  Furthermore the various labeled cells now display characteristic morphological hallmarks of differentiated neurons including interneurons of the INL, photoreceptors, and Müller glia (Fig. 4E, F).  \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/2847/2847fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
