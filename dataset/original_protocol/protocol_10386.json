    "1. Design and Fabrication of Stent Models\nNote: The following steps have been followed to create laboratory-scale models of straight and curved stents. The installation of the two stent models will embody a \"Type IV\" fracture (fragmentation and linear displacement of fractured stent parts).\nNote: The authors used Pro/Engineer software at the time of the research for creating CAD models of the stent geometry. The procedure below is generalized and may not include terms generic to the CAD software used. Other CAD packages available can also be used. The steps that follow are applicable for the CAD software that the authors used at the time of the research and have been adapted from the manufacturer's website. For further description of the rapid prototyping machine used by the authors see the Materials List. The parametric equations and initialized values for stent design are presented in Table 1 and Figure 1D and 1E are examples of the straight and curved stent models after rapid prototyping.\nCreate straight stent geometry by defining parametric equations and initializing parameters of the left and right helices in a Cartesian (X-Y-Z) co-ordinate system (Table 1).\n\t\nGenerate a set of 10 equi-spaced left turning helices in a planar circular array about a straight datum line or z-axis, using Eq. 1, 2, 3 and 5 shown in Table 1, with initialized values of number of turns\n\t\t(imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq29.jpg), pitch, stent wire thickness (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq30.jpg) and nominal diameter of the stent (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq31.jpg) (Figure 1A and Table 1).\nRepeat step 1.1.1 using Eq. 1, 2, 4 and 5 to generate a circular pattern of 10 equispaced left helices (Figure 1A).\nGenerate straight stent geometry by combining or assembling the left and right turning helices about a common axis (Figure 1A).",
    "Create curved stent geometry by defining parametric equations and initializing parameters of the left and right helices in cylindrical (R-β-X) co-ordinate system or about a curved datum line (Table 1). Repeat steps 1.1.1 - 1.1.2 with the previously initialized parameters using Eq. 1, 2, 6 and 7.\n\t\nGenerate a curved stent geometry combining or assembling the left and right turning helices curved about a common axis (R) and subtending an angle imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq32.jpg at the origin (Figure 1B).\nCreate high-resolution stereo lithography (STL) files from the straight and curved stent CAD models .\n\t\nSelect 'Export > Model' from the 'File menu'. Choose 'STL' option. Set 'chord height' to 0. Set 'Angle control' to 1. Apply 'OK' to create the STL-file. Note: The value of 'Angle Control' regulates the amount of tessellation along surface with small radii and the setting can be between 0 and 1.\nFabricate the stent models on a rapid prototyping machine shown in Figure 1C using materials listed in the materials and equipment table.\n\t\nStart the 3D printing software (see Materials List). Click on 'Insert' to locate the STL-file on the 3D-printer computer and select the desired file. Drag the mouse on the screen to place the 3D rendering of the STL-file on a virtual platform ('Tray') on the screen.\nSelect appropriate units as 'mm' (Options: 'mm' or 'inches') from the file menu tabs. Select the quality of finished product as 'Matte' (Options: 'Matte' or 'Gloss'). Select 'Tray settings > Validation' tab from the file menus.\nLook for the 'Validation succeeded' message to continue to the next step. If validation is unsuccessful repeat steps in 1.3 - 1.4.2 until successful validation is achieved.\nSelect 'Tray settings > Build' tab from the file menus to send the file to the 3D-printer for fabrication.",
    "Note: The value of the 'chord height' controls the degree of tessellation of the model surface. It affects the accuracy and file size of the model will be replaced by a minimum value automatically. Small values of chord height leads to less deviation from the actual part geometry with file size tradeoff. Validation check is required to make sure that the part is contiguous and void of any structural anomalies during the fabrication stage.\n2. Prepare Kinematic Viscosity– and Refractive Index–matched Blood-analog Fluid\nNote: The following procedure will yield approximately 600 ml of blood-analog solution. A summary of the chemical reagents and solvents with relevant properties used in the solution preparation are presented in the Materials List. Relevant material properties, suggested laboratory equipment and the guidelines for volumetric calculations are presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4, respectively.\nPrepare a saturated solution of Sodium Iodide (NaI).\n\t\nPour 500 ml of deionized H2O into a 2,000 ml beaker. Place the beaker on the magnetic stirrer.\nMeasure ≈860 g of NaI on a zeroed-weight balance and add 100 g increments into the beaker while stirring and waiting for the current addition to fully dissolve before adding the next. Record the temperature at each addition, since the process of saturation of deionized H2O with NaI is slightly exothermic. Refrigerate the solution as necessary to maintain it at RT (≈ 25 °C).\nAdd small NaI increments (≈5-10 g) up to 20 g, until the solution is saturated. Record the mass and temperature of each addition. Remove the beaker with saturated NaI solution from the magnetic stirrer when done.\nMeasure the density of the saturated NaI solution (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq33.jpg).",
    "Add 10 ml of saturated NaI solution from step 2.1 to a 50 ml beaker on a zeroed-scale using a syringe (or volumetric pipette), making sure there are no air bubbles. Record mass and the volume added.\nCalculate density of each addition using Eq. 8 (see Table 3) . Repeat this step about 4-5 times. Average the densities recorded. Return the solution to the batch of saturated NaI solution prepared in step 2.1.\nEstimate the total volume of the blood mimicking solution.\n\t\nMeasure the mass of the saturated NaI solution prepared in step 2.1 and calculate its volume (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq34.jpg) using Eq. 9. Estimate the total volume of the blood mimicking solution (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq35.jpg) and the partial volumes of glycerol (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq36.jpg) and deionized water (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq37.jpg) to be added following Eq. 10, 11 and 12 (see Table 3).\nPrepare blood-analog solution.\n\t\nPrepare a blood analog solution comprising of 79% saturated NaI solution, 20% glycerol and 1% deionized water (by volume) through homogenized mixing on a magnetic stirrer.\nPlace the beaker with the saturated NaI solution on the magnetic stirrer and add glycerol in small increments (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq38.jpg), using a syringe (or graduated or volumetric pipette) until the entire volume of glycerol (imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq36.jpg) calculated in step 2.3 is added. For each imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq39.jpg iteration, record the volume added and wait until the solution is visibly homogenized before the adding the next increment of glycerol.\nAfter complete homogenization of saturated NaI solution and glycerol, add imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq40.jpg using a syringe (or graduated or volumetric pipette). Continue stirring on the magnetic stirrer until the blood-analog solution is visibly homogenized.\nCharacterize the blood analog fluid at standard ambient temperature and pressure (25 °C, 1 atm).",
    "Measure the kinematic viscosity (ν) using a standard Ubbelohde viscometer or equivalent measuring instrument. Kinematic viscosity can be adjusted by adding small, measured quantities of glycerol using a graduated or volumetric pipette.\nMeasure the refractive index (n) using a refractometer. Refractive index can be adjusted by adding minute quantities of sodium thiosulfate anhydrous using a spatula.\n\t\tNote: The authors report the kinematic viscosity, ν = 3.55 cSt (3.55 x 10-6 m2 sec-1 ± 2.8%) and the refractive index of the blood analog fluid, n = 1.45 (± 3.4%) 5, 6.\n3. Arrange Experiment for Measurement of Secondary Flow Velocity Fields Downstream of a \"Type IV\" Stent Failure\nNote: The 180° curved artery test section comprises of two acrylic blocks glued together, 180° curved channel machined on each block and provision for inlet and outlet pipes as shown in Figures 1F, 3A and 3B. The materials selected for the test section are ensured to have optical accessibility. The authors report the refractive index of material used in the test section as ≈1.4914 5, 6 (See Table 2).\nInstall stents fabricated in step 1 in the curved artery test section made of acrylic to embody an idealized Type IV fracture scenario, entailing a complete transverse fracture of stents and linear displacement of fragmented parts (see Figures 1F, 3A and 3B).\n\t\nPlace the straight stent upstream of the curved artery test section (see Figures 1F and 3B). To ensure that the spacing between the straight and the curved stents is '3 times' the diameter of the tube (Dtube = 12.7 mm), place the 45° curved stent inside the curvature with one end at the inlet to the curved tube (Figure 2B).",
    "Assemble the experimental setup by connecting the straight acrylic pipes to the inlet and outlet of the 180° curved artery test section as shown in the schematic overview of the experimental arrangement (Figure 2) on an optical table (Figure 3A).\n4. Acquire of Secondary Flow Velocity Fields\nNote: The following description in the protocol pertains to the acquisition of secondary flow velocity fields using particle image velocimetry (PIV) technique. Figure 3B (schematic drawing) shows that there four locations (45°, 90°, 135° and 180°) with angular notches to facilitate laser sheet projection and making planar cross-sectional secondary flow velocity. The protocol steps pertain to measurements acquired for the 90° location. If the laser sheet is placed at 45° location, camera is placed at the 135° location to gain optical access for secondary flow measurements at the 45° location.\nNote: The procedure below is generalized and may not include terms generic to the image acquisition and post processing software and the instrument control software used (see Materials List). Other image and data acquisition packages available can also be used in the protocol.\nTurn on the laser using the ON/OFF switches located on the laser power source. Illuminate a small piece of paper to visualize the laser sheet. Adjust the laser sheet thickness(to approximately 2 mm) visually, by turning the laser sheet focusing optics located on the laser source.\nPlace the laser sheet along the 90° measurement region so that the sheet is perpendicular to the optical table. Place the camera near the 0° or 180° location to gain optical access the cross-sectional view illuminated by the laser sheet.",
    "Align laser and camera using the image acquisition and post processing software to adjust the field of view of the camera to sufficiently capture the image of the circular cross-section of the curved artery (see Figure 3A) and reducing the particle distortion. Perform the alignment by 'trial and error' by inspecting the software-generated image of the field of view. Switch off the laser using the control switches located on the laser power source and make sure that the camera is turned on with the lens cover removed.\nStart image acquisition and post processing software on the PIV data acquisition computer and log in as 'expert user'.

The alignment procedure is complete at this stage.",
    "Note: The laser pulses at this stage are controlled by the image acquisition and post processing software and can be further controlled by varying pulsing frequency or 'Exposure' in the software settings. The laser will stop automatically since it is controlled by image acquisition and post processing software. Do not close image acquisition and post processing software as the current project will be used to acquire PIV data in the steps that follow.\nAcquire images of the secondary flow fields using 2C-2D PIV system by following the steps below to ensure phase-wise PIV data are generated using temporal trigger pulses from the pump instrument control computer that are synchronized with the dual pulse laser and camera.\n\tNote: The programmable pump is connected to the pump instrument control computer and is controlled by the instrument control software program. The steps that follow involve setting up software control modules on PIV computer using the image acquisition and post processing and pump instrument control computer using instrument control software.\n\t\nTurn on the programmable pump using the ON/OFF switch located on the pump. Launch the instrument control program on the pump instrument control computer.\nLoad the text-file that has the values of voltage-time waveform with a reference trigger (t/T = 0), that represents the physiological (carotid artery) flow rate waveform on to the instrument control software maintaining a physiological Womersley number imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq41.jpg and, maximum Reynolds imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq42.jpg and Dean imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51288/51288eq43.jpg numbers (Figure 4A).\nSet 'Amplitude' to 1 (Volts), 'DC offset' to 0 (Volts), 'Number of time steps' to 1,000 and 'Time period' to 4 (seconds) on the instrument control software interface screen.\nConfirm that the external power mode on the laser power source in Step 4.5, is still activated.

Navigate to 'Laser Control' to confirm. The PIV system is now ready to acquire data.",
    "Select the 'RUN' radio button on instrument control software interface on the pump instrument control computer to supply fluid to the experiment using the inputs provided in step 4.8.2-4.8.3 along with a trigger pulse every 4 seconds.\nSelect 'Start Recording' for acquiring phase-wise measurements using trigger-signal from the pump instrument control until the predetermined number of planar velocity fields (200, adequate to attain statistical convergence 5, 6, 31, 32) at each time instance set up in the Table scan (see step 4.8.7) at the 90° location is made.\nPress 'Stop' on the laser power source once the recording is done. Turn off the pump and camera, and place the camera lens cover. Select 'Stop' radio button on instrument control software interface on the pump instrument control computer.\nVisually inspect experimental setup to gage the level of leakage, gather the leaked fluid if necessary, to ensure that all devices have been powered off or can be left on standby, whichever is appropriate. Close the recording session in the image acquisition and post processing software.\n5. Detect Coherent Secondary Flow Structures\nNote: Use the image acquisition and post processing software and a set of command-line functions (MATLAB-based toolbox, PIVMat 3.01) to import, post-process and analyze 2- component vector fields from the PIV system 5, 6, 33.\nCreate a mask that encompasses the internal flow geometry i.e., the circular, planar cross-sectional area.\n\t\nSelect the project created in step 4.4, that now has PIV data acquired at each instance of time specified in the step 4.8.7.
