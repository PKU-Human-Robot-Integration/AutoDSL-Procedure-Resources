    "Pre-incubate plasmid DNA (300 ng pMK3) with or without protein sample: MrgA, MrgA*, BSA, or Lysozyme (10 and 20 µg) in 30 µl of protein-binding buffer: For 1 h at 37 °C.Add 8 µl of 1.5 mM fresh ferrous ammonium sulfate solution, gently mix the samples by pipetting, and then incubate for 5 min at room temperature (25 °C). Note: Ferroxidation of ferrous iron by oxygen does not proceed significantly before the addition of hydrogen peroxide at this time scale. This 5-min incubation in our experiment is to allow MrgA to sequestrate ferrous iron in its core.Add 2 µl of 200 mM hydrogen peroxide (final conc. 10 mM) and gently mix the samples by pipetting, and then incubate for 5 min at room temperature (25 °C).Add 10 µl of 10% SDS and 50 µl of CIA, and vortex. This is to denature and remove the proteins from DNA, and to recover DNA in aqueous phase in the next step.Recover supernatant by centrifugation at ≥13,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Separate 20 µl of the supernatant on 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer (without EtBr) and electrophorese at 100 V for 40 min at room temperature. Following the electrophoresis, soak the gel in TAE buffer containing EtBr to visualize DNA.Measure the signal intensities of supercoiled DNA using NIH image J software. In detail: Take agarose gel images by UV-trans illuminator and CCD camera (FASIII system). Scan the photo copy by conventional scanner (if you can get high quality digital image from CCD camera, it can be directly used for the measurement. We scanned the photocopy because the resolution of the digital image is low in case of FASIII system). Measure the signal intensities of supercoiled DNA were using NIH image J software.",
    "Measure each signal intensity by subtracting the background. Calculate relative signal intensities using the signal intensity of the supercoiled plasmid DNA without oxidative stress. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the relative intensities from multiple independent experiments. Evaluate the statistical significance by Student’s t-test.Figure 1 shows the result of recombinant MrgA and MrgA*. MrgA and MrgA* were prepared as described previously (Ushijima et al., 2014), and their purities were higher than 95% in SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie brilliant blue. MrgA has both ferroxidase activity and DNA binding activity, while MrgA* is impaired in its ferroxidase activity. As a negative control, either 1 µg/µl bovine serum albumin (BSA) or 1 µg/µl lysozyme can be used (see Recipes).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150721/20150721005010_5420.jpgFigure 1. Representative data. A. Relative amount of supercoiled plasmid DNA. Mean and SD values of no protein (n=9), MrgA (n=4), MrgA* (n=3), BSA (n=6), and lysozyme (n=4) are shown. All proteins are 10 µg. *: Significant difference compared to oxidative stress exposure (lane 2) in t-test, p < 0.05. ns: Not significant, p >0.25. B. Representative gel image of DNA protection assay. Lanes 1: Plasmid DNA without oxidative stress. Lanes 2: Plasmid DNA treated with oxidative stress (Fe2+/H2O2). Lanes 3~6: Plasmid DNA was pre-incubated with 10 µg of MrgA (lane 3), MrgA* (lane 4), BSA (lane 5) or lysozyme (lane 6) prior to the Fe2+ addition. SC: Supercoil, N: Nicked. DNA protection by MrgA was dependent on the intact ferroxidase activity, and DNA binding by MrgA* didn’t contribute to DNA protection (Ushijima et al., 2014)."
