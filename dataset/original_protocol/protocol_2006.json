Using Equation (2)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd2], for a general laser-scanning MPM,    V  m i n     can be represented as",
    "(Equation 6)    V  m i n   =  {       7.5188  n   NA   f   FOV  m a x     λ  e x c    ,  NA ≤ 0.7         7.3937  n    NA 0.91   f   FOV  m a x     λ  e x c    ,  NA > 0.7      .     \nConsidering N = 1 in Equation (5)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd5] for the optimized case, the minimum laser repetition rate required will be\n   (Equation 7)    R  m i n   =   V  m i n   .     \nTo characterize a laser-scanning MPM in terms of its optical-resolution retrieving ability, a Nyquist figure-of-merit (NFOM) is formulated as\n   (Equation 8)   NFOM =   V  e f f    V  m i n    ,     \nwhere Veff is the effective voxel-sampling rate or the image-pixel sampling rate. In case of pulse-level synchronization, Veff can be replaced with R/N, and thus substituting Veff and Vmin, Equation (8)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd8] can be written as\n   (Equation 9)   NFOM =  {       0.133   R    λ  e x c      n    N   f    NA  FOV  m a x     ,  NA ≤ 0.7         0.1353   R    λ  e x c      n    N   f    NA 0.91     FOV  m a x     ,  NA > 0.7      .     \nUsing Equation (9)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd9], for an optimized condition with NFOM = 1 and N = 1, the maximum achievable aliasing-free FOV for a specified set of laser, fast-axis scanner, and objective lens can be estimated as\n   (Equation 10)    FOV  m a x   =  {       0.133   R    λ  e x c      n   f   NA     ,  NA ≤ 0.7         0.1353   R    λ  e x c      n   f    NA 0.91    ,  NA > 0.7      .     \nFor a conventional laser-scanning system (Chun et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), the optics-limited fast-axis field of view, FOVOL can be determined as\n   (Equation 11)    FOV  O L   = 2  tan  |  θ ±  |  ×    f o   f s    f t   ,",
    "where θ± is the fast-axis scan-angle by the scanning mirror with respect to the optical axis, fo, fs, and ft are effective focal lengths of the objective lens, scan lens, and tube lens, respectively.\nFollowing Equations (6)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd6], (7)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd7], and (11)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd11], and substituting FOVmax with FOVOL, you can estimate the minimum required repetition rate as\n   (Equation 12)    R  m i n   =  {       15.0376  n     NA   f  tan  |  θ ±  |   f o   f s     λ  e x c    f t    ,  NA ≤ 0.7         14.7874  n      NA 0.91  f  tan  |  θ ±  |   f o   f s     λ  e x c    f t    ,  NA > 0.7      .     \nConstruction of the large-angle optical raster scanning (LAORS) system\nTiming: 1 day\nRefer to Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] depicting the essential elements of a large-angle optical raster scanning (LAORS) system, primarily comprising:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1602-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Note that multiple colors are utilized to better distinguish the rays under different scanning angles by the resonant and galvanometer scanning mirrors (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for more information on optical performance at different scanning angles).\na typical pulsed laser source with an adequate repetition rate (Fidelity 2, Coherent, USA),\na raster scanning unit with a resonant scanner (CRS 4 kHz, driver: 311-149887) for fast X-axis and a galvanometer scanner (8320K, driver: MicroMax 671) for slow Y-axis (both from Cambridge Technology, USA),",
    "a general scan lens (LSM05-BB, Thorlabs, USA) with an effective focal length (EFL) of 110 mm,\na dedicated tube lens was custom designed combining three plano-convex lenses (Edmund Optics: 86-925), each with clear aperture and EFL of 73.5 mm and 500 mm, respectively, resulting in a combined EFL of 166.7 mm,\na high-NA and low magnification objective lens (Olympus XLUMPlanFl, 20×/0.95W) with an EFL of 9 mm.\nOptically couple pulsed laser output to the resonant scanning mirror. Note that prior to coupling, the laser output must be sufficiently expanded to fulfill the clear aperture of the resonant scanning mirror. Depending on the laser beam diameter, a suitable beam expander can be chosen.\nOptically couple the resonant scanning mirror to the galvanometer scanning mirror as depicted in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. Note that one must try to minimize the distance between these two mirrors. We recommend ∼12.5 mm separation between the centers of CRS 4 kHz and 8320K scanning mirrors.\nOptically couple the galvanometer scanning mirror to LSM05-BB. The recommended separation between the galvanometer mirror and the front surface of LSM05-BB is 66 mm.\nOptically couple LSM05-BB to the custom tube lens unit. The recommended separation between the last surface of LSM05-BB to the front surface of the custom tube lens is 261 mm.\nBuild the custom tube lens by means of combining three plano-convex lenses (Edmund Optics: 86-925). The separation between each lens is recommended to be close to zero. A minor separation can be maintained to prevent surface damage. As depicted in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], we recommend the flat surface to point toward the objective side.",
    "For mounting the lenses, three adjustable ring mounts, such as, 03-670, Edmund Optics, can be used. The three mounts should be placed in series with minimal separation and are expected to be parallel to each other. The height of the three mounts should be maintained the same.\nNote that a large clear aperture helps extend the scanning angle.\nNote that splitting of the optical power, in this case, helps reduce spherical aberration.\nOptically couple the custom tube lens to XLUMPlanFl, 20×/0.95W. The separation between the last surface of the custom tube lens unit to the back aperture of the objective lens is recommended to be 172 mm.\nOptional: As depicted in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] schematics, we recommend 3 steering mirrors 1, 2, and 3, to provide a compact optical design. Note that the mirrors are expected to be large enough to incorporate the scanning beam. Therefore, at least a 50 × 50 mm2 mirror size is recommended. While choosing the same, surface flatness of at least one-fourth of the wavelength is expected. The position of the mirrors can be adjusted as per the design/experimental requirements. We further recommend using an appropriate Faraday Optical Isolator right behind the high-intensity laser output to avoid any back reflection into the laser cavity. This becomes critical especially when the laser is not equipped with an internal isolator.",
    "Note: Following Equation (11)[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd11], targeting a fast-axis FOV of up-to 1.6 mm, the LAORS system requires a fast-X-axis scanning angle of up-to ∼±7.7° with respect to the optical axis. With a 9.25 mm input beam diameter, the root mean square (RMS) wavefront errors (without defocus) and Strehl Ratios were found to be <0.07λ and >80%, respectively, for 0° and ±7.7° off-axis configurations along the fast X and slow Y axes, being optimized at a wavelength λ = 1,070 nm (presuming a typical Yb-fiber laser) while considering the objective lens to be a perfect one. Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2C depict modulus of the optical transfer function (OTF) versus spatial frequency (cycles/mm) for angles of ±7.7° off-axis in the X direction, 0° off-axis in X and Y directions, and ±7.7° off-axis in the Y direction, respectively.\nNote: The recommended optical design parameters, such as a separation between two surfaces, are based on Zemax simulation and are applicable only with our specified optical components. If you opt for relevant alternatives (especially the lenses), a simulation might be essential to optimize the parameters.\nNote: Following Equation 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd12] for our specific system configuration, we obtain a minimum required laser repetition rate of 60 MHz. Therefore, we opted for Fidelity 2 laser (Coherent, USA) with a 70 MHz repetition rate, a 1,070 nm central wavelength, and a <60 femtosecond pulse width. Note that considering Equation 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd5], we are now restricted to employing a synchronized sampling with N = 1, i.e., one-pulse-per-voxel. Following Equation 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd9], NFOM thus turns out to be greater than one, i.e., the digitization becomes guaranteed to be aliasing-free.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1602-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Note: data obtained from Zemax; blue and green curves in each plot represent the diffraction limit curves for the tangential and sagittal cases, respectively.\nConstruction of the fluorescence collecting optics for the LAORS system\nTiming: 1 day\nFigure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] illustrates a schematic of fluorescence collecting optics, an essential part of the LAORS system, comprising:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1602-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The turning mirrors are optional.\na primary dichroic beam-splitter (FF801-Di02 or FF735-Di02, Semrock),\na relay system made up of two lenses with EFLs of 150 mm (Edmund Optics: 32-982) and 40 mm (Edmund Optics: 48-654), respectively,\na photomultiplier tube (PMT, R10699, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan),\none or more relevant bandpass filter(s), such as FF01-580/60-25-D, Semrock.\nPlace the dichroic beam splitter prior to the back-aperture of the objective lens which will help reflect the emerging fluorescence signal towards the photosensitive area of the PMT.\nFor efficiently focusing the fluorescence signal, make use of a relay system as illustrated in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. With a demagnification factor of 3.75, a ∼4 mm focused spot diameter is ensured throughout the scanning range. Note that R10699 provides a 24 × 8 mm2 photosensitive area which is large enough to support the 4 mm-wide focused spot.",
    "Place appropriate band pass filter(s) prior to the photosensitive area of the PMT to ensure detection of the specific signal of interest. For instance,\nUse FF01-580/60-25-D, Semrock to ensure detection of Nav1.8-tdTomato or Alexa Fluor 546 two-photon fluorescence signals.\nUse an additional color glass filter in series (FGB37-A, Thorlabs) to reject any residual reflection of the excitation wavelength.\nConstruction of the control and data acquisition system\nTiming: 5–7 days\nPrepare the computer. The requirements are enlisted in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]. A simple block diagram representation of the control and data acquisition system is depicted in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1602-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Block diagram of the proposed control and data acquisition system\nThe system comprises of- a computer: with i7-9800X 8-core processor and Nvidia Quadro RTX 8000 for CUDA-acceleration; a multifunction I/O card: PCIe-6341 (National Instruments Corporation, USA); a digitizer: ATS9440 (Alazar Technologies Inc., Canada); a 70 MHz pulsed laser source: Fidelity 2 Yb-Fiber Laser (Coherent Inc., USA); a resonant scanning system: CRS 4 kHz (driver: 311-149887), a galvanometer scanning system: 8320K (driver: MicroMax 671), Cambridge Technology, USA; a 16-bit digital to analog converter (DAC): 6757 (Cambridge Technology, USA); a voltage buffer: 50LD (Thorlabs, USA); a power splitter: ZFRSC-42-S+ (Mini-Circuits, USA); a high voltage power supply: C9525 (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan); a transimpedance amplifier: C6438-01 (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan); a multi-axis stage controller: SHOT-304GS, and three linear stages: 2 × TSDM40-15X and 1 × SGSP80-20ZF (Sigma Koki, Japan); a software: C++ written custom application.\nMake sure the computer is powered off.\nInstall the cards at appropriate PCIe slots (recommended: PCIe 3.0 standard).\nPlace Quadro RTX 8000 or another alternative CUDA-enabled graphics card in an ×16 slot.\nPlace ATS9440 or another alternative AlazarTech digitizer in an ×8 or higher bandwidth slot.",
    "Place PCIe-6341 or another alternative National Instruments multifunction I/O card in an ×4 or higher bandwidth slot.\nConnect CRS 4 kHz and 8320K to the respective driver boards. Ensure a stable power supply for each driver.\nConnect the laser pulse sync signal from Fidelity 2 to the external clock input of ATS9440.\nFeed the electrical signal from R10699 to C6438-01 and connect the amplified output to the first analog input (channel A) of ATS9440.\nFeed the line trigger sync signal from CRS 4 kHz driver to a voltage buffer (50LD, Thorlabs), and by means of ZFRSC-42-S+, split the output into two: Sync-A and Sync-B.\nConnect Sync-A to the external trigger input of ATS9440.\nConnect Sync-B to PFI14 of PCIe-6341.\nConnect the amplitude control pin of the CRS 4 kHz driver to the AO 0 pin of PCIe-6341.\nInsert 6757 DAC to MicroMax 671 driver.\nPlug the ribbon cable to 6757 DAC. Follow the indication on the cable to ensure which end should be plugged to the 6757 unit.\nConnect the other end of the ribbon cable to PCIe-6341 digital I/O pins.\nMake sure that DB0-DB15 pins of 6757 are connected to P0.0-P0.7 and P1.0-P1.7 pins of PCIe-6341 sequentially.\nMake sure that CLR, R/W, CS, and LDAC of 6757 are connected to P2.0-P2.3 pins of PCIe-6341 sequentially.\nMake sure that all ground pins of 6757 are connected to the digital ground of PCIe-6341.\nConnect TSDM40-15X and SGSP80-20ZF units (or other alternatives from Sigma Koki) to SHOT-304GS.\nSGSP80-20ZF is dedicated to sample displacement along the axial direction.\nTwo units of TSDM40-15X are dedicated to sample displacement along the horizontal and vertical directions.",
    "Note that the TSDM40-15X units are to be attached in a way that their axes of motion are perpendicular to each other and this combined unit should be connected to the moving plate of the SGSP80-20ZF unit.\nFor holding a sample specimen, we recommend use of a typical sample holder, such as MPSH or MPSHSS, Thorlabs.\nConnect R10699 to C9525 (make sure a good-quality HSV cable is used).\nConnect SHOT-304GS and C9525 to the computer through USB cables.\nConnect the output of R10699 to C6438-01 and feed the amplified output of C6438-01 to Channel A of ATS9440.\nOptional: 50LD or other alternative is required only if the line trigger signal from CRS driver is with high impedance, and the relevant digitizer/interface card input is with low impedance. A phase matching circuit can be employed optionally to fine-tune sampling events with the laser-pulses to best optimize signal collection.\nNote: C6438-01 receives output from PMT R10699 and produces an amplified signal. ATS9440 uses the laser pulse sync signal as external clock input and triggers the sampling events. Our custom software handles slow-axis-synchronization, data acquisition, preview, and export processes. We enable synchronization of slow Y-axis with fast X-axis without sending an external electrical frame-trigger signal after completion of each frame. A background high-priority thread monitors the line trigger events from the resonant scanning mirror driver and produces 16-bit binary data words (generating a sawtooth waveform), i.e., the slow-axis angle-positioning-steps to 6757 DAC.\nInstalling LASERaster+\nTiming: <45 min\nFollow the below steps carefully to install the software.\nObtain the SetUp LASERaster+.exe file from the lead contact[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.1].\nRun SetUp LASERaster+.exe.\nIf prerequisite(s) is/are not found, installer will redirect to relevant site(s) to help download the specific driver(s)/software.\nPrerequisite 1: .NET framework (4.6.1 or newer).\nPrerequisite 2: NVIDIA driver (30.0.0 or newer).",

Distortions must be corrected prior to estimating X-FOV.\nTypically, we can assume that distortion in a digitized image is symmetric in nature. In that case, there is no need to enter any detail in Exact Speed Profile panel, and directly proceed to the next step.\nIt is possible that there exists a phase mismatch between the mechanical edge of the resonating mirror and starting of each fast-axis line leading to an asymmetric distortion, which might require a hardware-based calibration.

Note that based on the distribution of lines, the complete speed profile would be estimated as plotted in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]E.\nEnter a roughly estimated X-FOV value for now and click Apply.\nExport horizontal image of stage micrometer as depicted in Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]F, with disabled Calibrate Images but enabled Fix Distortion, and accordingly calculate and enter the X-FOV in millimeters.\nClick Apply to save the calibrations.\nNote: we follow the idea by Haji-Saeed et al. (2007)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] to correct nonlinear distortion along the fast X-axis. The algorithm was implemented via CUDA-acceleration for real-time applicability."
