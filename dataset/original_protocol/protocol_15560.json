    "All experimental procedures performed in this study were approved by the Biological Sciences Local Animal Care Committee, in accordance with guidelines established by the University of Toronto Animal Care Committee and the Canadian Council on Animal Care.\n1. Implantation of a head bar on top of the skull\nNOTE: To avoid the contribution of VOR behavior to the eye movements, the head of the mouse is immobilized during the OKR test. Therefore, a head bar is surgically implanted on top of the skull.\nAnesthetize a mouse (2-5-month-old female and male C57BL/6) by a mixture of 4% isoflurane (v/v) and O2 in a gas chamber. Transfer the mouse to a customized surgery platform and reduce the concentration of isoflurane to 1.5%-2%. Monitor the depth of anesthesia by checking the toe-pinch response and the respiration rate throughout the surgery.\nPlace a heating pad underneath the animal's body to maintain its body temperature. Apply a layer of lubricant eye ointment to both eyes to protect them from drying. Cover the eyes with aluminum foil to protect them from light illumination.\nSubcutaneously inject carprofen at a dose of 20 mg/kg to reduce pain. After wetting the fur with chlorhexidine gluconate skin cleaner, shave the fur on top of the skull. Disinfect the exposed scalp with 70% isopropyl alcohol and chlorhexidine alcohol twice.\nInject bupivacaine (8 mg/kg) subcutaneously at the site of incision, then remove the scalp (~1 cm2) with scissors to expose the dorsal surface of the skull, including the posterior frontal bone, parietal bone, and interparietal bone.\nApply several drops of 1% lidocaine and 1:100,000 epinephrine on the exposed skull to reduce local pain and bleeding. Scrape the skull with a Meyhoefer curette to remove the fascia and clean it with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).",
    "NOTE: The temporalis muscle is separated from the skull to increase the surface area for a head bar to attach.\nDry the skull by gently blowing compressed air toward the skull surface until the moisture is gone and the bone turns whitish. Apply a thin layer of superglue on the exposed surface of the skull, including the edge of the cut scalp, followed by a layer of acrylic resin.\n\tNOTE: The surface of the skull needs to be free of blood or water before the application of superglue.\nPlace a stainless-steel head bar (see Figure 1A) along the midline on top of the skull. Apply more acrylic resin, starting from the edge of the head bar until the base of the head bar is completely embedded in the acrylic resin. Apply acrylic resin two or three times to build up the thickness.\nWait for about 15 min until the acrylic resin hardens. Subcutaneously inject 1 mL of lactated ringer's solution. Then, return the mouse to a cage placed on a heating pad until the animal is fully mobile.\nAllow the mouse to recover in the home cage for at least 5 days after surgery. Once the animal is in good shape, fix its head with the head bar in the OKR setup for 15-30 min to familiarize it with the head fixation and the experimental environment. Repeat the familiarization once a day for at least 3 days.\n2. Setup of the virtual drum and video-oculography\nMount three monitors orthogonally to each other to form a square enclosure that covers ~270° of the azimuth and 63° of the elevation in the visual space (Figure 1B left).\nWith a discrete graphic card, merge the three monitors into a simple display to ensure synchronization across all the monitors.",
    "Calibrate the luminance of monitors as described below.\n\t\nTurn on the computer to which the monitors are connected and wait for 15 min. The warm-up is essential to have stable luminance.\nSystematically change the brightness setting on the monitor from 0 to 100 by steps of 25.\nFor each brightness value, measure the luminance of the monitors under various pixel values (0-255, steps of 15) with a luminance meter.\nFit the relationship between luminance and brightness for pixel value 255 with linear regression and estimate the brightness value that gives rise to 160 cd/m2.\nFor each pixel value used in the luminance measurement (step 2.3.3), estimate the luminance for the brightness value derived in step 2.3.4 based on linear regression. Use the power function lum = A * pixelγ to fit the relationship between the new set of luminance values (under the brightness value derived in 2.3.4) and their corresponding pixel values to derive the gamma factor γ and the coefficient A. These will be used to generate sinusoidal gratings of desired luminance values.\nSet the brightness of all three monitors to the values derived in step 2.3.4 to ensure their luminance values are the same for the same pixel value.\nGenerate a virtual drum, which is used to stimulate OKR behavior, with the visual stimulation toolkit, as described below.\n\t\nPresent a vertical sinusoidal grating on the monitors and adjust the period (spacing between stripes) along the azimuth to ensure the projection of the grating on the eye has constant spatial frequency (drum grating; Figure 1B middle and right).\nEnsure the animal head-fixed at the center of the enclosure so that it sees the grating has a constant spatial frequency across the surface of the virtual drum.",
    "Modify the parameters of moving grating, such as the oscillatory amplitude, spatial frequency, temporal/oscillation frequency, direction, contrast, etc., in the visual stimulation codes. Use two types of visual motion: (1) the grating drifts clockwise or counterclockwise in an oscillatory manner following a sinusoidal function:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65281/65281eq01v2.jpg\n\t\tHere, Amp is the amplitude of drum trajectory, f is the oscillation frequency, and t is the time (oscillation amplitude: 5°; grating spatial frequency: 0.04-0.45 cpd; oscillation frequency: 0.1-0.8 Hz, corresponding to a peak velocity of the stimulus of 3.14-25.12 °/s [drum velocity = Amp x 2π x f x cos (2π x f x t); contrast: 80%-100%; mean luminance: 35-45 cd/m2; (2) the grating drifts unidirectionally at a constant velocity:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65281/65281eq02v2.jpg\n\t\t​(Spatial frequency: 0.04-0.64 cpd; temporal frequency: 0.25-1 Hz; drum velocity = temporal frequency/spatial frequency.)\nSet up the video-oculography as described below.\n\t\nTo avoid blockage of animal's visual field, place an infrared (IR) mirror 60° from the midline to form an image of the right eye.\nPlace an IR camera on the right side behind the mouse (Figure 1C left) to capture an image of the right eye.\nMount the high-speed IR camera on a camera arm that allows the camera to rotate by ± 10° around the image of the right eye (Figure 1C right).\nUse a photodiode attached to one of the monitors to provide an electrical signal to synchronize the timing of video-oculography and visual stimulation.\nPlace four IR light emitting diodes (LEDs) supported by gooseneck arms around the right eye to provide IR illumination of the eye.\nPlace two IR LEDs on the camera to provide corneal reflection (CR) references: one is fixed above the camera (X-CR), while the other is on the left side of the camera (Y-CR; Figure 1D).",
    "Measure the optical magnification of the video-oculography system with a calibration slide.\n\t\tNOTE: The reference CRs are used to cancel out the translational eye movements when the eye angle is calculated based on the rotational eye movements.\nFix the animal's head at the center of the enclosure formed by the monitors, as described below.\n\t\nFix the animal's head with the head plate to the center of the rig and make it face forward. Adjust the tilt of the head so that the left and right eyes are leveled, and the nasal and temporal corners of the eyes are aligned horizontally (Figure 1E).\nMove the animal's head horizontally by coarse adjustment provided by the head-fixation apparatus and fine adjustment provided by a 2D translational stage, and vertically through the head-fixation apparatus and a post/post holder pair, until the animal's right eye appears in the live video of the camera. Before the calibration and measurement of eye movements, overlay the image of the animal's right eye reflected by the hot mirror with the pivot point of the camera arm (see details in step 3.4 below).\nBuild a customized enclosure around the OKR rig to block room light (Figure 1F).\n3. Calibration of eye movements\nNOTE: Rotational eye movements are calculated based on movements of the pupil and the radius of the orbit of the pupillary movements (Rp, the distance from the center of the pupil to the center of the eyeball). For each individual mouse, this radius is measured experimentally21.\nFix the animal's head at the center of the enclosure formed by the three monitors, as described in step 2.6.1.\nTurn the camera on and adjust the four LEDs surrounding the right eye to achieve uniform IR illumination.",
    "Under visual guidance, adjust the position of the right eye until it appears at the center of the video, as described in step 2.6.2.\nAlign the virtual image of the right eye with the pivot point of the camera arm, as described below.\n\t\nManually rotate the camera arm to the left extreme end (-10°). Manually move the animal's right eye position on the horizontal plane perpendicular to the optical axis with fine adjustment of the 2D translational stage (Figure 1C, green arrow), until the X-CR is at the horizontal center of the image.\nManually rotate the camera arm to the other end (+10°). If the X-CR runs away from the center of the image, move the right eye along the optical axis with fine adjustment until the X-CR comes to the center (Figure 1C, blue arrow).\nRepeat steps 3.4.1-3.4.2 a few times until the X-CR stays at the center when the camera arm swings leftward and rightward. If the right eye moves in the middle of one repetition, restart the adjustment process.\nMeasure the vertical distance between the Y-CR and X-CR after locking the camera arm at the central position. Turn the Y-CR LED on and record its position on the video, and then switch to the X-CR LED and record its position.\n\tNOTE: The vertical distance between the Y-CR and X-CR will be used to derive the position of the Y-CR during the measurement of eye movements in which only the X-CR LED is turned on.\nMeasure the radius of pupil rotation Rp, as described below.\n\t\nRotate the camera arm to the left end (-10°) and record the positions of the pupil (Pp1) and X-CR (PCR1) on the video.",
    "Then, rotate the camera arm to the right end (+10°) and record the positions of the pupil (Pp2) and X-CR (PCR2) on the video. Repeat this step multiple times.\n\t\tNOTE: The animal's right eye needs to remain stationary during each repetition so that the amount of pupil movements in the movie accurately reflects the degree of swinging the camera arm.\nBased on the values recorded above, calculate the radius of pupil rotation Rp (Figure 2A) with the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65281/65281eq03.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: The distance between the corneal reflection and pupil center in the physical space is calculated based on their distance in the movie:\n\t\tPCR - Pp = number of pixels in the movie x pixel size of camera chip x magnification\nDevelop the relationship between Rp and pupil diameter, as described below. Rp changes when the pupil dilates or constricts; proximately, its value is inversely proportional to the pupil size (Figure 2B top).\n\t\nChange the luminance of the monitors systematically from 0 to 160 cd/m2 to regulate the pupil size.\nFor each luminance value, repeat step 3.6 8-10 times and record the diameter of the pupil.\nApply linear regression to the relationship between Rp and pupil diameter based on the values measured above to derive the slope and intercept (Figure 2B bottom).\n\t\tNOTE: The outliers caused by occasional eye movements are removed before the linear fitting. For repetitive measurements in multiple sessions, the calibration needs to be done only once for one animal, unless its eye grows bigger during the experiment.\n4. Record eye movements of the OKR\nHead-fix a mouse in the rig following steps 3.1-3.4. Skip this step if the recording occurs right after the calibration is done. Lock the camera arm at the central position.",
    "Set up the monitors and the animal for scotopic OKR as described below. Skip this step for photopic OKR.\n\t\nCover the screen of each monitor with a customized filter, which is made of five layers of 1.2 neutral density (ND) film. Make sure no light leaks out through the gap between the filter and the monitor.\nTurn the room light off. The following steps are done with the aid of an IR goggle.\nApply one drop of pilocarpine solution (2% in saline) to the right eye and wait 15 min. Ensure the drop stays on the eye and is not wiped away by the mouse. If the solution is wiped away by the animal, apply another drop of pilocarpine solution. This shrinks the pupil to a proper size for eye tracking under the scotopic condition.\n\t\tNOTE: Under the scotopic condition, the pupil dilates substantially so that its edge is partially hidden behind the eyelid. This affects the precision of estimating the pupil center by video-oculography. Pharmacologically shrinking the pupil of the right eye diminishes its visual input, and thus the visual stimuli are presented to the left eye.\nRinse the right eye with saline to thoroughly wash away the pilocarpine solution. Pull down the curtain to completely seal the enclosure, which prevents stray light from interfering with the scotopic vision.\nGive the animal 5 min to fully accommodate to the scotopic environment before starting the OKR test.\nRun the visual stimulation software and the eye tracking software. For photopic OKR measurement, ensure the drum grating oscillates horizontally with a sinusoidal trajectory; for scotopic OKR measurement, ensure the drum grating drifts at a constant velocity from left to right, which is the temporo-nasal direction in reference to the left eye.",
    "NOTE: When the pupil of the right eye, but not of the left eye, is shrunk by pilocarpine under the scotopic condition, the OKR elicited by oscillatory drum stimulation is highly asymmetric. Thus, for scotopic OKR measurement, the left eye is stimulated while the movement of the right eye is monitored.\nThe eye tracking software automatically measures the pupil size, CR position, and pupil position for each frame, and computes the angle of eye position based on the following formula (Figure 2C):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65281/65281eq04.jpg\n\tHere, PCR is the CR position, Pp is the pupil position, and Rp is the radius of pupil rotation. The distance between corneal reflection and pupil center in the physical space is calculated based on their distance in the movie:\n\tPCR - Pp = number of pixels in the movie x pixel size of camera chip x magnification\n\tRp of the corresponding pupil size is derived based on the linear regression model in step 3.7.3 (Figure 2B bottom).\n5. Analysis of eye movements of the OKR with the eye analysis software\nProcess the eye traces using a median filter (filter window = 0.05 s) to remove high frequency noise (Figure 3A middle).\nRemove the saccades or nystagmus as described below.\n\t\nEstimate the eye velocity by calculating the first order derivative of eye movements (Figure 3A bottom). Identify the saccades or nystagmus by applying a velocity threshold of 50 °/s (Figure 3A bottom).\nReplace the saccades or nystagmus by extrapolating the eye positions during these fast eye movements from the segment before the saccades or nystagmus based on linear regression (Figure 3B).",
    "Compute the amplitude of OKR eye movements by fast Fourier transform (Goertzel algorithm) if the drum grating oscillates (Figure 3C), or compute the average velocity of eye movements during the visual stimulation if the drum grating moves at a constant velocity in one direction (Figure 3B bottom).\n\tNOTE: The amplitude of oscillatory eye movements derived from Fourier transform is similar to the amplitude derived from the fitting of the eye trajectory with a sinusoidal function (Figure 3D).\nCalculate the OKR gain. For oscillatory drum motion, OKR gain is defined as the ratio of the amplitude of eye movements to the amplitude of drum movements (Figure 3C right). For unidirectional drum motion, OKR gain is defined as the ratio of eye velocity to drum grating velocity (Figure 3B bottom).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
