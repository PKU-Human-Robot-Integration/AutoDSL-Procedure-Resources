    "The participants were recruited under an institutional review board approved protocol (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01789164). The equipment described in the protocol is ethically approved by our institution.\n1. Prepare the Materials used for the Hypercapnia Challenge (Figure 2)\nInflate a 200 L Douglas bag (Item #1) with a pre-mixed canister of medical-grade gas which is comprised of 5% carbon dioxide, 21% oxygen, and 74% nitrogen until full.\nInsert two diaphragms (Item #3) into the two-way non-rebreathing valve (Item #4) to safeguard that the gas will only flow in one direction. Attach one port of the three-way valve (Item #2) to the Douglas bag (Item #1) via the gas delivery tube (Item #5), and the other port to the two-way non-rebreathing valve (Item #4) via a second gas delivery tube (Item #5).\nFasten the mouthpiece (Item #6) to the connector (Item #7) and then fasten the connector to the two-way non-rebreathing valve (Item #4).\nInsert the capnograph tubing (Item #8) into the hole in the connector (Item #7).\nAttach the air-filter (Item #9) to the capnograph tubing (Item #8).\nScrew the end of the plastic air-filter (Item #9) that isn’t connected to the capnograph tubing (Item #8) into the CO2 (Item #10) monitor.\nConnect the capnograh (Item #10) to a laptop with a cable. Open the data port reader software, select the corresponding USB port and start the data reading. Turn on the capnograph. Data will automatically be displayed on the computer screen.\nConnect the fNIRS box to the computer with a USB cable. Connect the source-detector headband to the FNIRS box. Connect the power adapter to the fNIRS box and turn on the switch.\n2. Procedures during the experiment\nAsk the participant to sit on a chair and to make themselves comfortable while setting up the devices. Turn the fNIRS system on.",
    "Place the source-detector headband on the patient’s forehead, over the underlying prefrontal cortex areas (dorsal and inferior frontal cortical areas)21.\nCheck that the source-detector headband is carefully positioned above the eyebrow and in the middle of the forehead. Place the lower detector row approximately 3.5 cm above the nasion or bridge of the nose where the indentation of the upper nose meets the forehead between the eyes.\nMake sure the detectors are firmly adhered to the participant’s skin without chromophores (e.g., make-up) or hair interfering. No skin preparation is needed.\nUnder “Device Setting”, set the gain for detectors between 1 and 20. A higher gain will increase the sensitivity of the light detectors. The default value is 20. Set the “LED Current” between 5 mA and 20 mA. Larger values will result in brighter light and will increase the signal level generated by the detectors. The default value is 20 mA.\nIn the acquisition software, press “Start Current Experiment”. Sources will send light at 2 wavelengths and light signal intensity detected from each detector will be displayed in real time. In case of saturated (signal>4,000) or low signal (signal <1,000), adjust the contact between the source-detector headband and the skin or the parameters in step 2.3 and 2.4. The exact full procedure has been explained in Ayaz et al.22.\nDirect the participant to inhale and exhale through their mouth at their normal breathing pace. Fasten a nose clip on the participant’s nose and remind them to continue breathing normally through their mouth, and to alert someone if they feel any discomfort or have any difficulty breathing.",
    "Carefully insert the mouthpiece (item#6) into the participant’s mouth so that they can continue to breathe. For increased participant comfort during the procedure, ask the participant to support the non-rebreathing valve (Item #3) with their hand.\nPress the “Baseline” button in associated software. It will measure and automatically record the light signal for the fNIRS baseline for 20 seconds (s).\nPress “Record” before starting the experiment.\nAt the beginning of the experiment, start the clock, press “Manual Marker” and write on a paper the time displayed by the capnograph. Every minute turn the valve connected to the gas tubing to cycle between room air and room air mixed with 5% CO2. Again, press “Manual Marker” and write on a paper the time displayed by the capnograph each time the inhaled gas mixture is changed (Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: Manually marking the time displayed on the capnograph is essential for future synchronization between fNIRS optical signals and capnograph’s EtCO2 trace.\nAfter 7 min, stop the fNIRS recording by clicking the “Stop” button. Allow 60 additional seconds of recording for the end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) and save the EtCO2 data as ASCII within the data reader software.\nNotify the participant that the procedure is completed. Carefully take off the nose clip and withdraw the mouthpiece. Offer a tissue to the participant to absorb any accumulated saliva from the procedure.\n3. Clean up Procedures\nDispose of the capnograph tubing (Item #8), filter (Item #9), mouthpiece (Item #6) and nose clip.",
    "Cleanse the reusable equipment. Detach the two-way valve (Item #4) from the gas-delivery tube (Item #5) and the connector tube (Item #7) and extract the diaphragms (Item #3). Immerse the diaphragms (Item #3), connector tube, and two-way valve (Item #4) in a container full of a medical-grade detergent disinfectant that is phosphate-free and contains surfactants for 20 min. Dilute the detergent with distilled water in a ratio of 1:64.\nWash items #1,4,7 with distilled water then place them on top of a clean counter with a sterile material such as a chux pad underneath. Allow them to air-dry before re-use.\nEmpty the Douglas bag.\n4. Data analysis\nSignal processing using fNIRS data processing software\n\tNOTE: Signal processing is the first step of the data analysis. It is done using an fNIRS data processing software (e.g., fNIRSoft) in order to remove noise or artefact in the data due to patient movement. Only data from the acquisition software are needed for this analysis.\n\t\nIn data processing software, click on “Load File” to select and then upload the acquired fNIRS data.\nClick on “Refine” and a pop-up window will appear. Select “Raw Data” and press “Next”.\n\t\t\nClick on both the median filtering and the sliding window motion artifact rejection (SMAR)23 tools to recognize and delete both motion artifact and saturated channels from the raw signal. Press “Apply”.\nClick on “Low Pass Frequency” filter to discard pulse and breathing component (Hanning filter, n=20, cutoff=0.1Hz)21,24,25,26. Press “Apply”.\nClick on “Detrend” to eliminate the slow temporal variation. Press “Apply”.\nClick on “OXI” to transform the light intensity into HbO and HbR concentrations. Click on “Save” and then select MATLAB as the save file format.\nSignal processing with MATLAB",
    "NOTE: The second part of the analysis is done using MATLAB in order to correlate the fNIRS signal with the time shifted EtCO2. Data from the previous step (4.1.5) and data from the capnograph (EtCO2 trace, step 2.12) are needed for processing the data.\n\t\nImport the EtCO2 trace from the capnograph in MATLAB as two columns (one for time and the second for EtCO2 values). Shift the EtCO2 time with pre-calibrated time to correct the delay from the sampling tubing time.\n\t\tNOTE: This is the time difference between one breath to the mouthpiece and the appearance of that breath on the CO2 recording. In this set-up, it was 15 s.\nUse the first time point recorded from the capnograph at the beginning of the experiment, step 2.11 as the starting point (t=0). Convert the EtCO2 into seconds.\nImport the oxy and deoxyhemoglobin data from step 4.1.3 into MATLAB.\nCalculate the physiological delay between EtCO2 (measured in the mouth) and the fNIRS signal (measured in the brain) by finding the higher correlation coefficient between these two signals at varying time shifts. (see MATLAB script attached for step 4.2.3 to step 4.2.6). The time shift with the higher correlation coefficient is considered the optimal time.\nShift the EtCO2 time course by the optimal time (obtained in step 4.2.4). Keep the time points that have both fNIRS and EtCO2 data. The two-time series should have the same length.\nCalculate CVR values for each channel, which is the solution of the linear equation between HbO (or HbR) and EtCO2 using the Cholesky decomposition in MATLAB.\nSubscription Required.
