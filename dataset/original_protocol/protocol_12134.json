  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were approved by Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees, and carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Egg Handling\nPurchase fertilized eggs from a local vendor. Store eggs at 13 °C in a refrigerator for no longer than 5 days prior to incubation. Embryo viability significantly decreases after 1 week.\nSwab each egg with 70% ethanol before setting in the incubator.\nSet 1-2 dozen(s) of eggs on their sides in an incubator with the temperature set to 38 °C at ~50% humidity. This ensures proper embryo positioning for electroporation and optimal viability, respectively.\n\tNOTE: After 48-52 h of incubation, the eggs will be at Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) stage ~12-13 and ready for electroporation.\n2. Preparation\nPlasmid Mixing\nAdd 1 µL of 0.1% fast green (0.1% in 18 MΩ deionized and distilled H2O [ddH2O]) for every 7 µL of DNA mixture.\nFor co-electroporation of multiple plasmids, mix plasmids in a 1:1 ratio. The final DNA concentration should be 5-8 µg/µL.\nFill Injection Pipette\nPull pipettes on a micropipette puller. Fill the pipette with 1-2 µL plasmids using a 28G syringe needle.\nBreak pipette tip to 10 - 20 µm using forceps. Use a microscope to assist in determining the size of the broken pipette tip. Attach the pipette to the pipette holder of the picospritzer.\n3. Windowing\nNOTE: The windowing procedure has been published before13. Please see reference 13 for additional visual information.\nWipe all instruments and the work area with 70% ethanol.\nTake the desired number of set eggs out of the incubator (between 6-10), leave at room temperature, and individually swab eggs with 70% ethanol again. Eggs remain viable for at least 2 h after incubator removal.",
    "Place the egg on top of a light illuminator to identify embryo positioning. Circle the center of the dark area (i.e., embryo) with a pencil.\nUsing a 19G needle, poke a hole in the blunt end of the egg.\nPoke another hole near the drawn circle on the pointed side of the egg. Remove a small piece of the outer eggshell (about 16 mm2) with the 19G needle and then remove a small piece of the inner eggshell (about 8 mm2) with forceps.\nWith a 3 mL syringe fitted with a 19G needle, withdraw 1.5-2.5 mL of albumin from the egg through the blunt-end hole. Be sure to angle the needle down at 45°.\nCover the blunt-end hole with a small piece of tape (1 cm x 1 cm). Cover the drawn circle and the second hole with tape (2.5 cm x 4 cm).\nWith curved scissors (cutting edge = 2.5 cm), cut a window within the circle. Scissors should be parallel to the eggshell and the diameter of the window should be less than 2 cm.\n4. Plasmid Injection\nTurn on the picospritzer. Set the pressure to 18 psi and the duration to 5 µs. Turn on the air tank and lamp for the dissection microscope.\nMake 30 mL stock solution of a 1:10 dilution of store-bought Indian ink mixed in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Store at 4 °C. Injection of Indian ink is an important step to get a better visualization of the chicken embryo.\nFill a 1 mL syringe with the diluted Indian ink solution. Attach a 27G needle and expel any bubbles that are present in the syringe.",
    "Insert needle just under the yolk membrane ~2 - 3 mm from the embryo and inject ~0.2 mL of Indian ink gently under the embryo. Do not inject more than 0.5 mL of the Indian ink as it may decrease embryo survival.\nPlace the windowed egg on an egg holder under the dissection microscope. Use the highest magnification for best visualization of plasmid injection site.\nUsing forceps, remove the membrane over the injection area. Auditory brainstem regions of interest (i.e., NM and NL) arise from Rhombomeres 5 and 6 (R5/R6). R5/R6 are located adjacent to the otocysts (an embryonic structure in vertebrates that develops into the inner ear) that serve as landmarks for R5/R6 plasmid injections.\nLower the DNA-filled pipette into the neural tube overlying the R5/R6 region and between otocysts using the micromanipulator. A schematic of ideal placement is shown in Figure 1A.\nApply air pressure (18 psi, 5 µs duration) from the picospritzer to eject DNA in the neural tube.\n5. Electroporation\nTurn on the current/voltage stimulator.\nFill a 3 mL syringe with PBS and attach the syringe filter. Add 1-2 drops of PBS onto the embryo.\nLower the bipolar electrode to the embryo using the micromanipulator with the negative electrode above the injection site (medial) and the positive electrode lateral to the R5/R6 (Figure 1A). Avoid direct contact with the embryo. Use bipolar electrodes where the electrode material is platinum iridium. Adjust the spacing between the tips to 0.5 mm with forceps.\nUsing a current/voltage stimulator, pulse 20 times at 50 V for 1 ms at 1 s intervals.\nAfter electroporation, add one drop of PBS over the exposed area. Gently remove the electrode and clean it with a laboratory tissue and 70% ethanol. Close the window exposing the embryo with tape.",
    "Label eggshell with the injected plasmid type and the hatch date.\nPlace eggs back into incubator with window side up. Incubate at 38 °C with 50% humidity until desired developmental stage is reached.\nIf a tet-on vector is electroporated for temporal control of gene expression, apply Doxycycline (Dox) every 24 h to induce gene expression (see Section 6).\n6. Tet-on System for Temporal Control of Gene Expression\nUse the following plasmids:\n\tpCAGGS-T2TP: a transposase expressing plasmid.\n\tpT2K-CAGGS-rtTA-M2: a plasmid that stably expresses the Dox-binding protein.\n\tpT2K-BI-TRE-EGFP: a plasmid that contains a bidirectional tet-on promoter (TRE)-driving expression of the EGFP reporter and a second gene of interest.\n\tNOTE: The above three plasmids need to be co-electroporated in a 1:1:1 ratio.\nStock solution preparation:\nDissolve Dox in sterile PBS to produce a 1 mg/mL stock solution. Store at -20 °C.\nDox application:\nTo induce the expression of the gene of interest during certain developmental stages, apply Dox every 24 h.\nWhen applying Dox, take the egg out, open the window, pipette 50 µL Dox onto the chorioallointoic membrane, close the window and put the egg back into the incubator.\n7. Preparation of Dissecting Area for Brainstem Slices\nNOTE: The following sections (7 - 9) and procedures have been published before14. Please see these references for additional visual information.\nPrepare an agar solution (40 mg/mL agarose, i.e. 4% in ddH2O). Pour agar solution into a Petri dish and allow it to solidify at room temperature. Store covered agar plate in the refrigerator for future use during brainstem slicing of tissue.\nContinually bubble artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF) with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 (pH 7.2-7.4 and osmolarity: 295-310 mOsm/L).\nClean the working area and vibratome with 70% EtOH and rinse the blade with distilled water.",
    "Place a clean fluid absorption pad on the working area with appropriate dissecting tools.\nTake the agar plate out of the refrigerator, cut a small agar cube (10 mm x 10 mm x 8 mm). Glue the agar block to the stage of a vibratome-slicing chamber using commercially available superglue.\n8. Isolation of Chicken Auditory Brainstem\nOpen the egg at taped window site. Puncture the membrane sac with a scalpel and remove the head of the chicken embryo.\nDecapitate the chicken with sharp scissors.\nPlace the razor blade tip slightly posterior to the eyes. Incise through the skull at the rostral-to-caudal midline. Apply slight pressure depending on the age of the embryo. Older embryos require more pressure.\nGently push aside skin and feathers to expose skull and verify midline cut.\nApplying strong pressure, slice the rostral portion of skull with a razor blade. Immediately place blade posterior to eyes and cut through entire skull and brain tissue.\nMake midline-to-lateral incisions with scissors in the skull\"s caudal region, slightly anterior to neck muscles on both sides of the head. Expose brain and cerebellum by pulling away skull and excess tissue.\nCut tissue attached to the brainstem with scissors and remove the brainstem, which freely detaches from the skull.\n9. Preparation of Brainstem Slices for In Vivo Electrophysiology or Imaging\nPin down brainstem through the optic tecta.\nRemove the cerebellum by cutting peduncles with scissors, exposing the floor of the fourth ventricle.\nUsing tweezers, remove any membranous tissue and blood vessels from the brainstem surface.\nTo block the brainstem, make a horizontal cut at the most rostral end of the floor of the fourth ventricle, just caudal to the cortex. Make lateral cuts perpendicular through the optic tecta to isolate brainstem.",
    "Place a small amount of super glue on the vibratome stage directly in front of the agar block.\nLift the brainstem at the spinal cord using tweezers and place it on the super glue with rostral side down and dorsal side towards the vibratome blade. Remove excess glue with a laboratory tissue or filter paper.\nPour oxygenated ACSF into the vibratome stage. Set the vibratome blade at a 20-22° angle. Start vibratome at maximum-amplitude oscillation. Move the stage up towards the blade so the top of the tissue is parallel with the blade.\nRapidly move blade towards brainstem tissue. Slow down the blade considerably prior to the blade\"s contact with tissue.\nSlice tissue with the slowest possible forward speed. Once the blade is through the entire coronal tissue section, gently remove the slice using a transfer pipette.\nLower the stage 200-300 µm and slice again. Repeat until anatomical landmarks of auditory nuclei become visible, e.g., the distinct dorsal/ventral neuropil region of NL and the medial location of NM relative to NL.\nCarefully maintain slices in ACFS. This can be done at room temperature (22° C) or near physiological conditions (~41° C) using a warm water bath. Note the order of slicing. The first slice corresponds to the most caudal region of tissue and the last slice corresponds to the most rostral region. This roughly represents the tonotopic organization of the auditory brainstem, from low- to high-frequency encoding regions, respectively.\nSubscription Required.
