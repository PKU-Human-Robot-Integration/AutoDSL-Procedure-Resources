    "1. Preparation of the Taohong extract\nMeasure 39.6 g of prepared rehmannia root (Rehmannia glutinosa [Gaetn.] Libosch. ex Fisch. et Mey.), 29.7 g of peach kernel (Prunus persica [L.] Batsch), 19.8 g of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), 29.7 g of angelica (Angelica sinensis [Oliv.] Diels), 29.7 g of white peony root (Cynanchum otophyllum Schneid), and 19.8 g of ligusticum chuanxiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong hort), totaling 168.3 g of medicinal materials11, and place these ingredients in a decoction casserole.\nPerform decoction three times.\n\t\nFor each round, add 1,683 mL of water, and boil the ingredients for 1.5 h.\nCombine the filtrate, and filter the resultant liquid with gauze. Concentrate the liquid in a rotary evaporator to a final volume of 400 mL.\nEvenly pour the concentrate into an evaporation dish, and place in a water bath at 90 °C to dry the excess water.\nPlace the thickened extract in a vacuum drying oven at 85 °C, and dry for 8 h to obtain a dry extract.\nSubsequently, grind the dried extract into powder in a mortar, and then sieve with an 80-mesh sieve.\n\t​NOTE: The resultant dry extract was in the form of a pink herbal powder containing the four medicinal ingredients.\n2. Screening of the fillers\nUse lactose, pre-gelatinized starch, and microcrystalline cellulose as the fillers.\nUse cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVPP) as a disintegrant and magnesium stearate as a lubricant.\n\tNOTE: Three formulas were used to generate prescriptions for testing.\nPrepare Formula 1: 0.5 g of medicinal powder and 3.4 g of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) to produce the filler and 1 g of PVPP and 0.1 g of magnesium stearate to produce the lubricant.",
    "Prepare Formula 2: 0.5 g of medicinal powder, 3.4 g of pre-gelatinized starch as the filler, 1 g of PVPP as the disintegrant, and 0.1 g of magnesium stearate as the lubricant.\nPrepare Formula 3: 0.5 g of medicinal powder, 3.4 g of lactose as the filler, 1 g of PVPP as the disintegrant, and 0.1 g of magnesium stearate as the lubricant.\nMix each prescription thoroughly, and pass through an 80-mesh screen. Place the evenly mixed powder into a single punch tablet machine, and punch out a tablet.\nTest each tablet separately. Place the tablet into a beaker with 1 L of 37 °C distilled water.\nPlace the beaker into a dissolution tester (Table of Materials).\nStart the dissolution tester, and time the reaction. When the tablets are completely disintegrated, stop the timer, and observe whether the tablets are evenly dispersed.\n\t​NOTE: We considered the disintegration time and dispersion uniformity as indicators in the subsequent experiments. The data arising from each prescription are given in Table 1.\n3. Disintegrant selection\nMix the three excipients in pairs to create three different prescriptions, and test the combinations.\nPrepare formulation 1 with PVPP and low-substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose (L-HPC) (1:1).\nPrepare formulation 2 with L-HPC and carboxymethyl starch sodium (CMS-NA) (1:1).\nPrepare formulation 3 with PVPP and CMS-Na (1:1).\nMix each prescription thoroughly, and pass through an 80-mesh screen. Place the evenly mixed powder into a single punch tablet machine.\nInvestigate the appearance and shape of the tablets. Place the tablets on a white background, and observe whether the appearance of the color is uniform. Measure the disintegration time as per steps 2.7-2.9.\n\t​NOTE: The results are shown in Table 2.\n4. Optimization of the filler and disintegrant dosage",
    "Optimize the specific dosage of the fillers (step 2) and disintegrants (step 4) by performing an orthogonal experiment using the dosage of microcrystalline cellulose as factor A, the dosage of crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone as factor B, the dosage of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as factor C, and the blank error as factor D.\nPrepare the excipients according to Table 3. Weigh the excipients separately, and mix the three formulations evenly.\nPass the formulations through a sieve with a screen diameter of 0.18 mm.\nPress the formulations into tablets. Measure the disintegration time as per steps 2.7-2.9.\n\tNOTE: Table 3 and Table 4 show the factor-level arrangement and orthogonal experiment arrangement.\nImport the data obtained into spreadsheet software for data analysis.\n\t​NOTE: Table 5 shows the results of the variance analysis, and Figure 1 shows the trends for each test index.\n5. Screening of the drug loading\nNOTE: Following the filler and disintegrant tests, the optimal contents of microcrystalline cellulose, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, sodium carboxymethyl starch, and magnesium stearate were determined to be 4.4 g, 1.8 g, 1.2 g, and 0.1 g, respectively.\nWhile keeping the relative content of the filler, disintegrant, and lubricant constant, prepare prescription 1 with 1 g of medicinal powder, prescription 2 with 1.5 g of medicinal powder, prescription 3 with 2 g of medicinal powder, and prescription 4 with 2.5 g of medicinal powder.\nThoroughly mix the powder, filling agent, disintegrant, and lubricant used in each prescription, and pass through an 80-mesh sieve.\nPress the tablets, and place a tablet in the disintegration time tester.\nStart the instrument and time; stop the timer after the tablet has completely disintegrated.\n\t​NOTE: The prescription schedule is shown in Table 6.\n6. Quality evaluation of the Taohong Siwu dispersible tablets\nAppearance evaluation",
    "NOTE: According to the requirements of the 2020 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia General Rule 010112, the appearance of the tablet should be complete and smooth, and the color should be uniform.\n\t\nRandomly select six pieces from each of the three batches to observe whether the surface of the dispersible sheet is smooth and the color is uniform.\nWeight variation\n\t\nFor the evaluation of the wet weight, take 20 tablets from each batch, and accurately determine the total weight. Determine the mean tablet weight.\nWeigh each tablet separately.\nCompare the weight of each tablet with the mean weight.\n\t\tNOTE: The difference between the mean weight and the weight of an individual tablet should not exceed 0.30 g ± 7.5%. The difference in weight should not exceed that of two tablets, and the weight of no single tablet should exceed the limit by a factor of one.\nDisintegration and dispersion uniformity tests\n\tNOTE: According to the provisions of General Rule 0921 of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia12, we determined the disintegration time for each batch of tablets.\n\t\nHang a gondola on a bracket with the stainless-steel shaft at the upper end. Immerse the apparatus in a 1 L beaker, and adjust the position of the gondola so that the screen is 25 mm from the bottom of the beaker when it drops to its lowest point.\nFill the beaker with water at a temperature of 37 °C ± 1 °C, and adjust the height of the water level such that the sieve is 15 mm below the water surface when the gondola rises to its highest point. Ensure that the top of the gondola is not submerged in solution at any point.\nTake six tablets from each test batch, and place them in a glass tube in the gondola.\nActivate the dissolution tester.",
    "NOTE: Each tablet needs to be completely disintegrated within 15 min.\nIf one tablet is not completely disintegrated, then take another six tablets for re-testing. All the tablets must meet the required regulations.\n7. Characterization\nChromatographic conditions\n\t\nUse a chromatographic column with a column of 2.1 mm x 100 mm (e.g., ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 1.7 µm).\nUse a mobile phase of 100% acetonitrile (A) and 0.5% phosphoric acid aqueous solution (B).\nFor gradient elution, use the following elution program: 0-4 min (10%-30%), 4-10 min (30%-60%), 10-15 min (60%-85%), 15-17 min (85%-50%) %), 17-20 min (50%-110%), 20-22 min (10%-10%).\nUse a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min, a detection wavelength of 260 nm, a column temperature of 30 °C, and an injection volume of 2 µL.\nSolution preparation\n\t\nPrepare an amygdalin reference solution. Dissolve the amygdalin in methanol at a concentration of 0.2 mg·mL−1.\nPrepare a test solution.\n\t\t\nFor each sample, crush five tablets with a mortar, and place in a 25 mL volumetric flask with 25 mL of 80% methanol, volumetric to scale.\nUltrasonicate each sample at 150 W and 40 kHz for 30 min to dissolve.\nCool each sample to room temperature, and then add 80% methanol to a total volume of 25 mL.\nFinally, filter the sample with a microporous membrane (0.22 µm). Use the substrate as the product for testing.\nLinear relationship analysis\n\t\nTake 1 mL of the reference solution, and filter with a microporous filter membrane (0.22 µm).\nTransfer 0.5 µL, 1 µL, 1.5 µL, 2 µL, 2.5 µL, and 3 µL of the reference solution into the chromatography column, and perform chromatography as described in section 7.1.\nInject the sample, and record the peak area.\nPerform linear regression using the peak area (y) and injection volume (x) as the variables.",
    "NOTE: The regression equation obtained was y = 18115x − 2386.6 (R² = 0.9993), thus indicating that amygdalin exhibits a good linear relationship in the range of 0.0492-0.3101 mg. Figure 2 shows the standard curve.\nPrecision testing\n\t\nInject 2 µL of the reference solution (prepared as described in section 5.2.1) into the chromatograph six times successively.\nRecord the peak area, and calculate the relative standard deviation (RSD) value.\n\t\tNOTE: The measured RSD value for the peak area of amygdalin was 2.7%, thus indicating that the instrument exhibited good precision.\nRepeatability experiments\n\t\nTo evaluate the repeatability, grind 30 dispersible tablets into a fine powder, and mix the resultant powders together.\nDivide the pooled powder into six batches weighing approximately 1 g each.\nPrepare the test solution as described in section 7.2.2.\nInject 2 µL of each sample, record the peak area, and calculate the RSD value.\n\t\tNOTE: The measured peak area RSD value was 1.8%, thus indicating that the method exhibited good repeatability.\nStability experiments\n\t\nUsing the same test solution, inject 2 µL of solution at 0 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 14 h.\nRecord the peak area, and calculate the RSD value.\n\t\tNOTE: The measured RSD value of the peak area of amygdalin was 2.8%, thus indicating that the test solution was stable for 24 h at room temperature.\nSample recovery testing\n\t\nTake six samples of dispersible tablets, and prepare test solutions according to the method described in section 7.2.2.\nAdd 1 mL of the control substance to the same injection bottle, measure the sample content according to the conditions described in section 7.1, and calculate the recovery rate.",
    "NOTE: The analysis showed that the mean recovery rate of amygdalin (n = 6) was 101% and that the RSD value was 2.8%, thus indicating that the method exhibited good accuracy.\nDetermination of the sample content\n\t\nUse three batches of dispersible tablets to prepare test solutions in accordance with the method given in section 7.2.2.\nInject 2 µL of each sample under the chromatographic conditions described in section 7.1.\nRecord the peak area, and measure the content.\n\t\tNOTE: The mean content of amygdalin in the three batches of dispersible tablets was 0.257 mg/tablet.\nDissolution determination\n\t\nTake six batches of dispersible tablets, and measure the dissolution rate according to the small cup method for dissolution determination described in the 2020 edition of Chinese Pharmacopoeia12.\nUse 0.1 M of hydrochloric acid (250 mL) as the dissolution medium, and perform the testing at 37 °C ± 0.5 °C and 100 rpm for 50 min.\nImmediately pass the samples through a microporous membrane (0.22 µm).\nInject and test according to the chromatographic conditions described in section 7.1.\nRecord the peak area and dissolution rate.\n\t\tNOTE: The dissolution rates of the six batches of samples were 98%, 99%, 96%, 97%, 97%, and 98%, respectively."
