    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHarvest and rest the activated T cells\nTiming: 3.5 h\nPrepare activated mouse T cells for resting without TCR or cytokine stimulation.\nHarvest the day 3-activated mouse T cells (see section isolation and activation of mouse naïve T cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.1]) from 24-well plates:\nUse a P-1000 pipette to resuspend the semi-adherent mouse T cells from a 24-well plate.\nTransfer all the cultured cells from the same mouse/genotype into one 15 mL conical tube and spin down with 500× g for 3 min at 20°C–22°C (room temperature).\nAfter spin down, resuspend the cell pellet with 10 mL of RPMI 1640 and spin down with the same setup again.\nThe RPMI 1640 used here contains no other supplements.\nRepeat step 2 twice for a total of three times to wash cells thoroughly.\nAfter cell washing, resuspend cell pellets in a small volume of RPMI 1640.\n1 or 2 mL of RPMI 1640 is recommended to resuspend the cell pellet.\nCount the cell number in the single cell suspension.\nCell counting can be performed with an automated cell counter or hemocytometer.\nDead cells must be excluded by using the trypan blue dye.\nAll experimental samples described in the protocol are based on using 106 live cells per sample.\nDepending on the experimental setup, transfer 1 million live cells from different genotypes or 1 million live cells from the same sample to a 96-well plate.\nFill up each well containing cell samples with RPMI 1640 to the final volume of 300 μL.\nRest the cell samples in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3 h.\nThe RPMI 1640 should not contain any supplement and make sure the cells receive minimal growth factor signals or cytokine signals.",
    "The resting step is to lower the signaling event to a basal level and is necessary for conducting assays that assess signaling events after acute receptor-ligand re-stimulation.\nSkip this step if the readout of the downstream assay is not influenced by previous culture conditions.\nSLO-mediated T-cell membrane permeabilization and substance (e.g., ATP) supplementation and their impact on acute TCR signaling as assessed by immunoblotting\nTiming: 1–1.5 h (depending on the optimal condition determined previously)\nAfter resting cells or directly following the cell harvest procedure, spin down the cells in the 96-well plate at 500× g for 3 min at 20°C–22°C (room temperature).\nResuspend and wash the cell pellets with 300 μL Ca2+- and Mg2+-free HBSS solution and spin down at 500× g for 3 min at 20°C–22°C (room temperature).\nRepeat the wash with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free HBSS 3 times.\nCritical: Using Ca2+ and Mg2+-free HBSS to wash the cells is critical to promote membrane resealing and improve the efficiency of SLO-mediated membrane permeabilization.\nWhile washing the cells, dilute the SLO stock solution to the optimal concentration determined previously (see section streptolysin-O optimization for cell membrane permeabilization[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]).\nUse Ca2+- and Mg2+-free HBSS solution as the base solution.\nThe final volume is 100 μL/106 live cells.\nAdd the substance to be delivered intracellularly to the SLO-containing solution.\nThe concentration of the substance should be higher than that of the intracellular compartment because the supplementation is dependent on a passive diffusion and concentration gradient.\nTitration of the concentration of the substance is also recommended before conducting the experiment.\nIn the articles published by Xu et al. (2021a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] and 2021b)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], ATP is supplemented in a concentration of 10 mM.\nThe final volume is 100 μL/106 live cells.\nWarm up the SLO and the supplement solution to 37°C in a water bath.",
    "When cell washing is completed, resuspend the cell samples in the SLO solution with or without the supplement substance and incubate in a tissue culture incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2 for the time length determined previously (see section streptolysin-O optimization for cell membrane permeabilization[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]).\nThe final volume is 100 μL/106 live cells.\nWhile cells are undergoing permeabilization and supplementation, prepare a solution that contains biotinylated CD3 and CD28 antibodies with or without the substance to be delivered intracellularly.\nThe base solution can be Ca2+- and Mg2+-containing HBSS or RPMI 1640.\nThe dosage of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 is dependent on the user’s need.\nFor a typical acute anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 crosslinking experiment, we recommend 5 μg/mL and 2 μg/mL, respectively.\nThe final volume is 100 μL/106 live cells.\nAfter incubation, take out the cell samples and wash the cells with Ca2+- and Mg2+-containing HBSS or RPMI 1640 2–3 times with 500× g centrifugation for 3 min at 20°C–22°C (room temperature).\nCa2+ and Mg2+ can promote cell membrane resealing even at 4°C.\nAfter washing, resuspend the samples with 100 μL solutions that contain anti-CD3/anti-CD28 with or without the supplementary substance, and incubate the samples in a 4°C fridge for 30–40 min.\nThis step is to coat T cells with activating antibodies.\nIt is important to keep supplementing the substance with the same concentration after the removal of SLO.\nIncubating T cells with antibodies is recommended to be done at 4°C or on ice to minimize endocytosis.\nCritical: If the substance is not supplied after the removal of SLO, the concentration gradient will cause a depletion of that substance while the plasma membrane is healed, and will possibly result in the opposite phenotype.",
    "While incubating, prepare a 20× streptavidin solution (Prozyme) in either Ca2+- and Mg2+-containing HBSS or RPMI 1640 for biotin-streptavidin-induced antibody crosslinking and keep it in a 37°C incubator.\nAfter antibody coating, warm up the bottom of the 96-well plate in a water bath for 2 min.\nBe careful not to contaminate the samples with water.\nQuickly add 20× streptavidin solution (5 μL into 100 μL per sample) and mix well. Keep the plate either in a 37°C water bath or an incubator for 5 min to allow crosslinking.\nThe time length of crosslinking can vary depending on the signaling kinetics of the specific pathway.\n5 min is recommended for assessing the proximal TCR and the downstream pathways including Akt-Foxo1 and mTORC.\nAfter crosslinking, quickly spin down the cells and immediately add 100 μL of 1× cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, with phosphatase and protease inhibitors) for every 106 cells to prepare immunoblotting samples.\nThe 10× lysis buffer stock solution should be warmed up to allow proteases and phosphatases to be completely dissolved (see below).\nDilute the 10× buffer with ddH2O, and add phosphatase (Roche) and protease inhibitor (Roche) cocktails before use.\nSLO-mediated T-cell membrane permeabilization and substance (e.g., ATP) supplementation and their impact on acute TCR signaling as assessed by immunofluorescent microscopy\nTiming: 1.5–2 h (depending on the optimal condition determined previously. Timing for cell fixation/permeabilization, antibody and hoechst staining etc. should be considered here as well)\nCoat a chamber slide with poly-D-lysine or other cell adhesives a night before the assay.\nDilute the poly-D-lysine solution (Gibco) in sterile PBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+, and prepare a working solution with 50 μg/mL poly-D-lysine.\nCoat the chamber slide surface with 250–300 μL of the working solution.\nIncubate the slides at 20°C–22°C (room temperature) for 1 h.",
    "Remove the solution and wash the slides 3 times with 300 μL of distilled water.\nMake sure to rinse the chamber thoroughly because excess poly-D-lysine solution can be toxic to the cells.\nAfter washing, leave the coated slides uncovered in the laminar hood to dry.\nThe dried plate can be used immediately or stored at 4°C sealed with parafilm.\nAfter finishing step 17 described in the previous section, transfer the entire groups of cell samples to different wells of the chamber slide and spin down at 500× g for 5 min to let the cells adhere to the bottom of the slide.\nWarm up the chamber slide in a water bath for 2 min.\nBe careful not to contaminate the samples with water.\nGently take out half (50 μL) of the solution in the chamber slide and add 50 μL of the 2× streptavidin solution in each well of the chamber slide. Keep the chamber slide either in a 37°C water bath or an incubator for 5 min to allow crosslinking.\nQuickly spin down the chamber slide and remove the supernatant. Immediately add 200 μL of 4% PFA solution to fix the cells at 20°C–22°C (room temperature) for 10 min.\nCritical: This fixation step is critical for preserving phosphorylated proteins after TCR or cytokine stimulation because phospho signaling can be quickly diminished within minutes or even seconds. Therefore, it is important to fix the cells as quickly as possible after a quick spin down.\nAspirate the supernatant slowly and carefully without disturbing the cells.

Schematic demonstration of how to aspirate and add buffers to the chamber slides",
    "Activated T cells are semi-adhesive and easily detach from the slide. Therefore, it is highly recommended to manipulate the slides with extra care. In order to preserve the cells, it is recommended to tilt the slide and aspirate the liquid from the edge with a thin western loading tip (Fisherbrand™ Gel-Loading Tips) to minimize the flow and disturbance. When adding a buffer to the slide, it is also recommended to tile the slide and add the liquid from the edge with a regular tip, and then slowly lay down the slide.\nWash the cells with 250 μL of PBS once in the chamber slide. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1])\nDo not directly add PBS to the cells, this will detach the cells.\nAdd 250 μL of PBS by touching the pipette tip to the chamber wall and slowly discharge the washing buffer.\nAfter washing, fix the cells again with 250 μL of Tonbo nuclear protein fixation buffer at 20°C–22°C (room temperature) for 40–60 min.\nAfter fixation, aspirate the supernatant and wash the cells once with 250 μL of Tonbo permeabilization buffer slowly and carefully without disturbing the cells.\nWhile washing, prepare the primary antibody or conjugated antibody cocktail.\nPrepare 250 μL antibody solution per sample.\nFluorophore-conjugated antibodies are recommended in order to minimize the wash steps to preserve the samples.\nUse the Tonbo permeabilization buffer to make the cocktail solution.\nAdd 250 μL of the antibody cocktail to the samples and incubate at 4°C 12–16 h (overnight).\nThe optimal amount of primary antibody needs to be titrated before staining or used as instructed in the manual.\nOn the next day, aspirate the primary antibodies slowly and carefully, and wash the sample twice with PBS at 20°C–22°C (room temperature).",
    "Add secondary antibodies to the samples (250 μL per sample) and incubate 1 h at 20°C–22°C (room temperature).\nThe optimal amount of secondary antibody needs to be titrated before staining or used as instructed in the manual.\nAfter secondary antibodies staining, wash the cells with PBS twice at 20°C–22°C (room temperature).\nIncubate cell samples with hoechst diluted in PBS for 10 min at 20°C–22°C (room temperature) and wash with PBS twice.\nThe optimal amount of hoeschst needs to be titrated before staining or used as instructed in the manual.\nMake hoechst stock solution at the concentration of 10 mg/mL and dilution in PBS with 1:500 to 1:2000 ratio.\nRemove the chamber wall slowly and carefully.\nAdd 2–3 drops or enough of antifade mountant on the top of the samples slowly and carefully, and apply the cover slide carefully.\nThe images can be taken with immunofluorescent microscopy (ZEISS LSM 880) with a desired setup and magnification."
