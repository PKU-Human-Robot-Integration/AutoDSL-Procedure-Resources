    "Growth system setupCultivation of Lotus japonicus seedlingsLotus japonicus seeds are carefully scarified with sandpaper inside a mortar until the seeds turn slightly grey (Figures 1A-1D). They are then surface sterilized with 1% NaClO for 6 min, washed three times with sterile water and subsequently incubated in sterile water on a rotator for 180 min at room temperature. Imbibed seeds are placed in four rows, each row with 20 seeds, on square Petri dishes (Figure 1E) containing 0.8% Bacto agar and incubated in the dark at 24 °C for 3 days.Subsequently, the germinated seedlings on square Petri dishes are cultivated for additional 10 days in the light (16 h/8 h day-night cycle) at 24 °C. Then they are used for the two-compartment setup (Figure 1G). The plates are placed into dark-colored flat boxes (Figure 1F) to provide a dark-stimulus to the roots from the bottom and encourage straight growth. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180402/20180402031155_8929.jpgFigure 1.

Seedlings ready for transfer to 2-compartement setups.Cultivation of carrot root organ culture on 2-compartment test Petri dishesAll steps need to be performed in a clean bench to avoid contamination of root organ culture.Both compartments (tester & nurse compartment, Figure 2A) of the spilt Petri dish are filled with MSR medium. However, only the MSR medium of the nurse compartment contains 10% sucrose, whereas the MSR medium of the tester compartment does not.",
    "Both compartments need to be filled with medium up to the top of the dish in order to assure the availability of sufficient substrate during the entire course of cultivation.A fresh root piece (about 2.5 cm) of a carrot root organ culture is placed onto the medium in the nurse compartment. The Petri dish is closed, sealed with Parafilm and incubated for 1 week upside down in darkness at 25 °C.7 days later, the carrot root culture in the nurse compartment is inoculated with R. irregularis. To this end, MSR-agar blocks (about 0.125 cm3) from another root organ culture containing fungal spores and mycelium are placed on two different spots on the growing carrot root culture in the nurse compartment. The plate is sealed and again incubated upside down in total darkness at 25 °C to allow the fungus to colonize the whole plate including the tester compartment.Incubate for 4 to 6 weeks. The plates need to be checked regularly (about once per week) in order to assure that only the fungus crosses the compartment barrier but the carrot roots do not. If carrot roots grow across the barrier to the tester compartment they need to be pruned using sterile scissors. When the fungal extraradical mycelium has spread over both compartments (both compartments are covered with fungal hyphae) you can proceed to the next stage.Placement of two Lotus seedlings into the tester compartmentClean the lid of the Petri dish with EtOH using a tissue paper to ensure maximum sterility.Heat forceps in the flame of a Bunsen burner and use the hot forceps to melt three holes (approx. 0.5 cm diameter) into the lid of the Petri dish on the tester compartment side.",
    "Two of the holes are needed for Lotus growth and the third is later used for labelled substrate application.13 days old Lotus seedlings are placed through the prepared lid holes in the tester compartment. Take care that the root is well-attached to the medium and is not hanging loose in the air. Seal the Petri dish with Parafilm.Carefully seal the two seedling holes as well as the application hole with Parafilm to avoid contamination.Cover seedlings immediately with a 2 ml Eppendorf tube (like a mini-greenhouse) to prevent them from drying out. Keep seedlings covered for the first 5 days of incubation. Build black envelopes yourself from commercially available cardboard sheets to cover the Petri dish such that the roots and fungus are kept in the dark and the Lotus shoots are in the light (Figures 2B-2D). Incubate for 3 weeks at 24 °C, 16/8 h day/night cycle until the fungus has colonized the root.Application of [U13C6]-glucose Labelled glucose is applied 3 weeks after Lotus seedling placement.100 mg of [U13C6]-glucose are dissolved in 2 ml MSR-medium (w/o sugar, w/o gelrite). The 2 ml [U13C6]-glucose/MSR solution is carefully pipetted into the tester compartment via the application hole in the lid. Strictly avoid that the labelled glucose solution also drips in the nurse compartment and wait until the liquid has soaked into the agar before moving the plate.After application of the labelled substrate, the application hole of the Petri dish is sealed again and the setup is incubated in the growth chamber for another week.Note: One week after the stable isotope-labelled substrate has been added, the tester plants as well as the extraradical mycelium of the fungus are harvested.Harvest of the tester plantsBoth plants are carefully isolated from the plate.",
    "By slowly lifting the lid of the Petri dish the attached Lotus plants will be extricated from the medium. Make sure that no gelrite pieces remain on the roots.Use one of the plants for quantification of root length colonization. Place the root of this plant in 10% KOH. Later stain the root with ink & vinegar (Vierheilig et al., 1998) and quantify root length colonization using a modified gridline intersect method (McGonigle et al., 1990).The other root system is used for isotopolog profiling. Place it into a 2 ml Eppendorf tube and immediately shock freeze it in liquid nitrogen.Extraction of the fungal extraradical myceliumThe MSR/gelrite medium of the tester compartment is cut into small pieces (about 0.125 cm3) and transferred into a 25 ml flask filled with citrate buffer.The buffer containing gelrite pieces is stirred for 15 min using a magnetic stirrer (750 rpm). Within this time the gelrite is dissolved and the fungal mycelium knots together.When knotted together, transfer the mycelium into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube by fishing it from the buffer with forceps. Centrifuge the tube for 1 min at 9,391 x g and remove the residual liquid.Subsequently shock freeze the sample in liquid nitrogen and keep it in a -80 °C freezer until mass spectrometry. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180402/20180402031602_3116.jpgFigure 2.

Completed setup ready for incubation without (C) or with (D) Eppendorf tubes to prevent the seedlings from drying out.Isotopolog profilingFreeze dry the samples.Transfer samples to 1.5 ml glass vials.",
    "Derivatize with 500 µl MeOH containing 3 M HCl (Sigma-Aldrich) at 80 °C for 20 h.Dry the sample using a gentle stream of nitrogen gas.Add 100 µl dry hexane to dissolve methyl esters of the fatty acids.Analyze the samples by GC/MS: use a quadrupole GC/MS machine equipped with an autosampler and heated injection port (GCMS-QP 2010 plus; Shimadzu).GC/MS setup.Inject an aliquot of the solution in split mode (1:5) at an injector and interface temperature of 260 °C. Hold the column at 170 °C for 3 min, then increase temperature by a gradient of 2 °C/min to a temperature of 192 °C, afterwards by a temperature gradient of 30 °C/min to a final temperature of 300 °C. Perform one scan run for each sample, detecting a mass range from m/z 45-600, for unambiguous identification of the fatty acid and for confirmation of the retention times; this is especially important after a longer period, without this special analysis, and after a column change.Analyse samples in SIM (single ion monitoring) mode (m/z values 267 to 288) at least three times. Retention times for fatty acids 16:1 ω5 (unlabeled m/z 268) and 16:0 (unlabeled m/z 270) are 12.87 min and 13.20 min, respectively. For the analysis of other fatty acids, determine retention times and m/z values in scan runs and implement the values into the SIM method. Collect data with LabSolution software or the software connected to your GC/MS system.Calculate overall 13C enrichment and isotopolog composition by comparison with an unlabeled sample according to Ahmed et al. (2014). The software package is open source and can be downloaded by the following link: http://www.tr34.uni-wuerzburg.de/software_developments/isotopo/[href=http://www.tr34.uni-wuerzburg.de/software_developments/isotopo/].",
    "Compare overall 13C excess (average value of 13C atoms incorporated into 16:0/16:1 ω5 fatty acids) as well as isotopomer distribution (M + 1, M + 2, M + 3, … M + 16). For detailed explanation of nomenclature see Eisenreich et al. (2013).Perform at least three independent labeling experiments. Data can be displayed as stacked columns as shown in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180402/20180402031831_2195.jpgFigure 3. Schematic representation of the istotopolog profiling pipeline. Analysis of samples via GC/MS SIM results in chromatograms of derivatized fatty acids. The individual mass spectra of 16:0 and 16:1 ω5 are extracted and the isotopomer distribution as well as the 13C overall excess (o.e) of these fatty acids is calculated. The isotopomer patterns can be displayed as stacked bars."
