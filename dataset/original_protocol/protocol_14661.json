    "1. Making polyacrylamide (PA) gels\nPreparation of Petri dish\nPrepare bind silane solution by mixing 200 mL ultrapure water with 80 µL acetic acid and 50 µL of 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate. Bind silane is a solution used to functionalize the glass bottom Petri dish surface for hydrogel attachment.\nStir the bind silane solution on a stir plate for at least 1 h.\nTreat the center well of the Petri dish with bind silane solution for 45 min.\nRemove bind silane solution and rinse the Petri dish with ultra-pure water 2x-3x.\nDry the Petri dish surface and store at room temperature for future use.\nPreparation of hydrogel solution\nMix ultra-pure water, 40% acrylamide, and 2% bis-acrylamide in a 15 mL centrifuge tube according to Table 1.\nAdd 80 µL of fluorescent beads to the hydrogel solution.\nGently shake the tube to mix beads with the gel solution.\nLightly tighten the tube cap on the centrifuge tube and place in a vacuum chamber.\nDegas the gel solution for at least 45 min in vacuum chamber.\nHydrogel polymerization\nFirst, add 75 µL of 10% ammonium persulfate (dissolved in ultra-pure water) and then add 8 µL of TEMED (N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethane-1,2-diamine) to the hydrogel solution.\nPlace 24 µL of hydrogel solution at the center of the Petri dish (see Table 2).\nUse an 18 mm coverslip to flatten the hydrogel. This will give a height of ~100 µm.\nWait at least 30-40 min for gel polymerization.\nSubmerge the polymerized hydrogel in ultra-pure water to prevent gel dehydration.\nCover the Petri dish with aluminum foil to prevent photobleaching of fluorescent beads and store at 4 °C.",
    "NOTE: Hydrogels can be stored a period of up to 3 months, but it is suggested that these gels be used no longer than 1 week after fabrication to obtain the best results.\n2. Cell culture\nCulture human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in cell culture medium 200 (see Table of Materials) supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin on 0.1% gelatin-coated flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n3. Micropattern stencil preparation\nCure a thin layer of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) in a 100 mm Petri dish by mixing the silicone base with the silicone curing agent at a ratio of 20:1 (base: curing agent).\n\tNOTE: It is possible to use other base to curing agent ratios (ex. 10:1 or 30:1). However, a lower base to curing agent ratio will yield a stiffer pattern, while a higher base to curing agent ratio will produce a softer pattern.\nPrepare a 20:1 (base:curing agent) PDMS solution and mix carefully in a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Invert the tube upside down and shake vigorously multiple times to ensure proper mixing of the PDMS solution, as nonuniform mixing will result in incomplete polymerization.\nRemove bubbles that have been introduced from the above step by centrifuging the PDMS solution for 1 min at 190 x g.\nPour 5-6 mL of PDMS solution in the center of a 100 mm Petri dish and agitate the dish until the PDMS solution covers the entire Petri dish surface.\nCure the PDMS solution overnight at 50-60 °C. PDMS can also be cured at room temperature.\nRemove a circular, 16 mm diameter PDMS stencil with a hole puncher.\nUse a biopsy punch to create small holes in the PDMS stencil. This protocol uses a 1.25 mm diameter biopsy punch.",
    "Sterilize PDMS stencils by first submerging them in 70% ethanol for 2-3 min, aspirating off excess ethanol and then placing under a UV light for 5 min.\n4. Collagen-I hydrogel coating\nRemove the coverslip from the hydrogel and aspirate any excess liquid.\nPlace the PDMS stencil on the hydrogel surface.\n\tNOTE: Tweezers can be used to apply light pressure to PDMS stencil to ensure a water-tight seal between the PDMS stencil and hydrogel surface. Our PDMS stencils are water-tight and thus prevent water access between the gel top surface and PDMS stencil bottom surface. Also, the hydrogel stiffness does not need to be adjusted with respect to the PDMS stiffness.\nCover the hydrogel surface with sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(4-azido-2-nitrophenylamino) hexanoate (sulfo-SANPAH) dissolved in a 0.1 M HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) buffer solution at a concentration of 1 : 1000 and place under a UV lamp (power 36 W) for 8 min.\nAspirate the excess sulfo-SANPAH and HEPES solution and rinse the hydrogel twice with 0.1 M HEPES followed by an additional two rinses with ultra-pure water.\nAspirate excess ultra-pure water and coat hydrogels with 0.1 mg/mL collagen-I overnight at 4 °C.\nCover the dishes and protect fluorescent beads from photobleaching.\n\tNOTE: PDMS stencils are used to create micropatterned monolayers. Micropatterned monolayers are utilized as they allow for multiple monolayers of the same geometry and dimensions to be observed simultaneously during each experiment. However, should micropatterns not be desired the above steps can be followed with the exception of step 4.2.\n5. Creating HUVEC monolayers on hydrogels\nUse 1x trypsin to detach cells from tissue culture flasks for 3-5 min in the incubator.\nAfter trypsinization, add cell culture media to the trypsin solution and add to the 15 mL centrifuge tube.",
    "Centrifuge the cell solution for 3 min at 1710 x g. A small, white pellet of cells should be visible at the bottom of the centrifuge tube.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend cells in media to a concentration of 50 x 104 cells/ mL.\nRemove collagen-I from the hydrogel and rinse 1x with PBS.\nAdd 75 x 103 cells to the top of the PDMS stencil and allow cells to attach to the hydrogel surface for at least 1 h in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRemove the PDMS stencil and add at least 2 mL of media to the Petri dish. Submerge the PDMS stencil in 10x trypsin to remove any attached cells and sterilize by spraying with 70% ethanol and then placing under the UV light for 5 min.\nPlace the Petri dish in the incubator and wait at least 36 h or until a confluent monolayer is observed.\n6. 2,5 dihydroxychalcone treatment for Cx43 disruption\nDissolve 2,5 dihydroxychalcone (chalcone) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to make a 0.1875 mg/mL stock solution.\nDilute the stock solution with cell culture media to make a low chalcone concentration (0.2 µg/mL) aliquot and a high chalcone concentration (2 µg/mL) aliquot.\n7. Data acquisition\nLocate cell islands with a microscope.\nAcquire phase contrast and bead images to image cell morphology and hydrogel displacements, respectively.\n\tNOTE: This protocol used a 10x objective for data acquisition.\nAt the end of the experiment, detach cells with 10x trypsin and acquire an image of the gel surface without cells (reference image).\n8. Immunostaining\nFix monolayers with 4% formaldehyde and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.\nRemove 4% formaldehyde and add 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 37 °C to permeabilize cells.\nRemove 0.2% Triton X-100 and rinse monolayers with PBS 2x-3x.",
    "Cover monolayer with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution for 45 min at 37 °C.\nRemove the 2% BSA solution and rinse monolayers with PBS 2x-3x.\nAdd primary Cx43 antibody at a concentration of 1:400 to the sample and incubate overnight at 4 °C.\nRemove primary antibody and rinse sample with PBS 2x-3x.\nAdd secondary antibody at a concentration of 3:200 and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: Samples should be covered to prevent photobleaching.\nRemove secondary antibody and rinse with PBS 2x-3x.\nCover sample with mounting medium (Fluromount-G DAPI) and seal with an 18 mm cover slip.\n9. Implementation of traction force microscopy (TFM) and monolayer stress microscopy (MSM)\nHydrogel deformation calculation\n\tNOTE: A step-by-step displacement calculation procedure using MATLAB is given below.\n\t\nOpen the main traction.m file in MATLAB (for all the MATLAB routines see Supplementary Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: Follow instructions provided in the code to set the MATLAB directory.\nDefine the following variables: image format, pixel-to-micron conversion, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio, and microscope objective.\nLocate the bead, trypsin image, and phase image using the OpenFiles subroutine.\n\t\tNOTE: For large data sets, it is best to name files in sequential order. For example, files should be named \"filename1.tif\", \"filename2.tif\", etc.\nDefine a square ROI (region of interest) around the cell monolayer and execute the cell_cropper subroutine to crop the original image.\nExecute the displacement_finder subroutine to compute displacements.\nExecute the Dedrift subroutine to remove any additional non-cellular displacements that may be due to microscope stage drift.\nComputation of tractions\n\tNOTE: Here, unconstrained tractions are calculated using our custom-written MATLAB routine. Step by step traction computation using the MATLAB routine previously mentioned is given below.\n\t\nDefine the following variables within the traction.m routine: boundary condition, gel thickness, gel height, and dedrift.",
    "Execute the traction_finder subroutine to calculate tractions and execute the plot_traction subroutine to plot tractions. All the tractions in x-direction (Tx) and y-direction (Ty) along with their corresponding pixel locations can be found in a traction.dat file that will be generated by the code.\nComputation of intercellular stresses\n\tNOTE: Step by step instructions for intercellular stress computation using the MATLAB routine previously mentioned are given below.\n\t\nExecute the mark_circular_domain subroutine to specify the monolayer boundary. This routine will prompt all cropped phase images sequentially for the user to manually draw a boundary around the monolayer. Keep a note of the nXPts generated in command window and use them later as grid parameters in both X axis and Y axis for FEM analysis (see step 9.3.2).\nExecute Run_StressCode to compute intercellular stresses. This subroutine directly reads parameters from \"model.in\" file and executes \"island.exe\" to perform FEM analysis. Before running this routine, make sure all parameters in the model.in file, i.e. grid parameters in X and Y, pixel to micron conversion, Young's modulus of the gel, Poisson's ratio, monolayer height, and monolayer pattern (strip or hole), are edited correctly.\nPlot all the FEM results using the plot_FEM_results subroutine.\n\t\tNOTE: All results generated will automatically be stored in the Results folder in the MATLAB directory.\nSubscription Required.
