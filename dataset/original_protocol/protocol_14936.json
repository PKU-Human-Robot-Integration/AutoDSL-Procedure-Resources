    "All animal experiments conformed to the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Johns Hopkins University, and animals were maintained in accordance with the guidelines of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Care (AAALAC). The surgical procedure is performed under sterile conditions in an operating room that undergoes a minimum of fifteen air exchanges per hour. All instruments are sterilized by autoclaving prior to the procedure and again with 70% ethanol in between each mouse during the procedure. All mice not expected to survive the surgical procedure are euthanized under CO2 for 3 min followed by cervical dislocation while still under anesthesia.\n1. Cell Preparation\nResuspend cultured Panc02 cells in phosphate buffered saline at 2 x107 cells/ml, and keep on ice.\n2. Mouse Preparation\nAdminister Ketamine (100 mg/kg) mixed with Xylazine (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally to 8-12 week old C57BL/6 female mice in divided doses.\nCheck to see that the toe pinch withdrawal reflex is abolished to ensure that the mouse is fully anesthetized.\nAdminister additional doses of Ketamine (100 mg/kg) mixed with Xylazine (10 mg/kg) as needed to fully anesthetize the mice.\nApply Puralube Vet Ointment to the eyes of the mice to prevent drying while the mice are under anesthesia.\nShave the surgical area of the mice to avoid contamination of the wound.\nPrep the left subcostal area of the incision with 70% ethanol and then iodine.\nPlace a surgical drape around the abdomen to maintain sterility.\n3. Laparotomy\nMake a left subcostal incision in line with the left ear through the skin and through the peritoneum using a scalpel.\nExpress the spleen through the incision by applying simultaneous digital pressure along the cranial and caudal aspects of the incision.\nLocate the splenic blood vessels at the inferior end of the spleen.",
    "Divide the spleen by placing two Horizon medium size ligating clips in the center of the spleen being careful to avoid damaging the splenic blood vessels at the splenic poles.\nPlace the upper pole of the spleen back into the peritoneum to avoid contamination.\n4. Tumor Injection\nDraw up 150 μl of phosphate buffered saline into a 26 G x 5/8” syringe.\nDraw up 100 μl of Panc02 (2 x106) cells into the same syringe maintaining the syringe in an upright position at all times during the injection.\nDip the needle in a 70% ethanol solution. The needle is dipped in 70% ethanol to ensure sterility.\nInject the cells slowly into the exposed hemispleen being sure the syringe is kept upright at all times. The bevel of the syringe should be observed at all times through the splenic capsule to avoid injecting the cells under the spleen. A whitening of the spleen and blood vessels should be observed upon injection. \nElevate the spleen and apply one medium Horizon clip under the spleen to occlude the splenic blood vessels.\nApply one small Horizon clip to the most distal aspect of the pancreas and splenic vessels.\nLigate the pancreas and splenic vessels from the hemispleen by cutting above the Horizon clips.\nPlace the mouse on its’ side, and irrigate the incision with distilled water.\n5. Abdominal Closure and Recovery from Anesthesia\nClose the peritoneum with a 4-0 running stitch.\nApply two to three skin clips to close the skin incision.\nAdminister 0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine or 5-10 mg/kg Carprofen subcutaneously to alleviate post surgical pain.\nPlace the mouse on a heating pad for recovery until mobile and the mouse demonstrates regular breathing patterns. Animals are only returned to the company of other animals after fully recovering from the surgical procedure.",
    "6. Necropsy Examination and Harvesting of the Liver\nBetween 30 to 60 days following the surgery, mice will begin to show clinical symptoms of metastasis and will require euthanasia. Signs of metastatic disease requiring humane euthanasia include enlarged abdomens and the development of ascites. Euthanize mice by inhalation of CO2.\nFollowing inhalation, perform cervical dislocation.\nAfter the animal has been determined to be non responsive, make an incision through the peritoneum to expose the abdomen using scissors.\nUsing forceps and scissors, gently cut the liver out of the abdomen.\nPlace the liver in OCT compound, and flash freeze using liquid nitrogen. Store the liver at -80°C. Alternatively, the liver can be fixed in 16% neutral buffered formalin at RT for 24 hr and paraffin embedded.\nSubscription Required.
