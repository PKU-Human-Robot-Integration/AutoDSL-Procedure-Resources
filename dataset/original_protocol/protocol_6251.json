    "Coating of coverslips and black NC filtersNotes:  Prepare in advance of experiment. The following steps should be performed inside the laminar flow hood. Dilute 200 μl of Matrigel (before use, slowly thaw a tube containing aliquoted Matrigel on ice) with 2 ml of HCMF (finally, 1:10 dilution). In our experience, the diluted solution can be stored at 4 °C for a week, but we usually use a freshly diluted stock. It is important to avoid the formation of Matrigel aggregates in the diluted solution. First, pour 2 ml of HCMF into a 15 ml tube placed on ice and wait for a while. Second, transfer approximately 900 μl of the HCMF into the 200 μl Matrigel-containing tube, immediately mix by pipetting and return the mixture to the initial 15 ml tube placed on ice. Mix well again.Coat sterile, round 18 mm coverslips using the above Matrigel solution. First, transfer 120 μl of the Matrigel solution onto a 35 mm dish and then cover the solutions with a coverslip (Figure 1I). We handle the coverslips with forceps (their tips should be immersed into 70% ethanol and air-dried before use). Incubate the coverslips at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator for 3-5 h (or more).Coat black NC filter(s) with ConA. Dilute 0.5 ml of ConA (before use, slowly thaw a tube containing aliquoted ConA on ice; 2 mg/ml) into 8 ml of HCMF in a 60-mm dish (the resultant working concentration is 0.125 mg/ml). Slowly place one side of the NC filter onto 5 ml of HCMF (without ConA) in another dish. When the whole surface of the filter becomes wet, immerse it completely and transfer the filter into the ConA-containing HCMF (Figure 1I). Incubate at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator for 3-5 h (or more).",
    "After coating of the coverslips, rinse them with 2 ml of plain DMEM or Medium 3 once (residual Matrigel does not affect axon outgrowth). Place the coverslips, with the coated side up, in new dishes containing 2 ml of Medium 3. Keep them in the CO2 incubator until use. Do not let them dry anytime.After coating of the NC filter(s), wash it five times each with 8 ml of HCMF (note again that ConA is toxic). Sterilize both sides of the NC filter, in the immersed condition in HCMF, with UV irradiation in the laminar flow hood (5-10 min/side, twice) (use of a UV-sterilizing box is preferable). Keep them in the HCMF at 37 °C in the CO2 incubator until use. Do not let it dry anytime.Note: Too long exposure with UV can destroy ConA on the NC filter. For explant-spreading, cut the coated black NC filer with a disposable scalpel to obtain narrow strips (the width of approximately 0.5-1 scale on the filter, 4-5 scales in length) (Figure 1J).Dissecting out spinal cords from mouse embryos and mounting the spinal cord explants onto the NC filterPreparation for dissectionCool the dissecting medium HCMF on ice. Sterilize dissection instruments with 70% ethanol. The following procedure can be performed outside the laminar flow hood. However, to prevent contamination of explant cultures with fungi, bacteria or yeasts, use sterile solutions, sterile dissecting tools and aseptic techniques. Sterilize the dissection instruments frequently with 70% ethanol during manipulation. A caution should also be taken to exclude the inclusion of fur into the dishes, which may be a major source of contamination in the cultures.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190917/20190917211323_8754.jpgFigure 1.

L. An example of spreading and nailing of an explant with forceps onto the NC filter (i). The spinal cord explant fixed on the filter is ready for mounting (ii). M. Setting up and mounting two explants on the coverslip with two metal weights.Removal of uterusEuthanize the pregnant mouse by CO2 inhalation, followed by cervical dislocation. Lay the mouse on its back onto a paper towel, and wipe the abdominal area thoroughly with 70% ethanol.Using blunt forceps, grasp the skin above the genitalia, and cut the skin and then muscles with large scissors to open the entire peritoneal cavity.Remove the uteri, using forceps and medium-size scissors, and transfer them into a 100 mm dish containing ice-cold HCMF.",
    "Care should be taken so that the uteri do not touch the body surface of the mouse.To reduce the possibility of contamination, wash uteri at least once, twice if possible, by transferring them to HCMF-containing 100 mm dish(es).Dissecting out embryos from the uterusNote: The following procedure can be performed outside the laminar flow hood. Place a dish containing the uteri under a dissecting microscope (We performed all subsequent procedures under a dissecting microscope). Using two pairs of blunt No. 5 Inox forceps, tear the uterine horn of each uterus carefully and isolate the embryos from their placentas and amniotic membranes. To avoid damages of embryos, we do not separate the uterus during isolation (keep the state of “peas in a pod”). By using a spatula, transfer the embryos into new HCMF-containing dishes. Take care not to damage embryonic bodies, especially the spinal cord. Frequently wipe forceps and other tools with 70% ethanol. These procedures, from isolating embryos to mounting explants before cultivation, can be performed outside the laminar flow hood, but keep the environment and your tools clean. For isolation of E11.5 mouse embryos from the uterus, see also Elhendawi and Davies, 2018.Check the pooled embryos, and discard those that appear damaged, malformed, abnormal, or too small and too large. By staging the embryos with the EMAP system (mentioned above), select appropriate embryos at E11.5 or earlier stages.Isolation of spinal cordsDissection should be performed as quickly as possible, and the dishes containing the remaining embryos should be kept on ice. Transfer 3-4 embryos per 60 mm HCMF-containing dish. First, remove almost all of the ventral organs from the embryo body by using two blunt No. 5 Inox forceps. At this step, we do not use scissors. We obtain the brain and spinal cords together with the surrounding tissues.",
    "Next, make an incision at the hindbrain-rostral spinal cord region by using blunt forceps. Dissect out the hindbrain and spinal cord regions from the vertebra, in the rostral-to-caudal direction. Do not peel off the meninges yet; the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) may also be attached. Using a cut pipette (cut the tip of the transfer pipettes with opening of approximately 4-5 mm), transfer the spinal cords (with the meninges) into new HCMF-containing dishes. It is better to quickly proceed to the step of mounting the spinal cords onto ConA-coated black NC filters. In our experience, the shorter period between dissecting out spinal cords and mounting them on NC filters results in better axon growth.By using two pairs of sharpened No. 5 Inox forceps (alternatively, ophthalmic scissors), tear (or cut) the dorsal midline (roof plate [RP]) of the spinal cord that is still covered with the meninges (Figure 1D), and open up the entire length of spinal cord like a book (we usually tear the RP by grabbing the adjacent meninges, but not spinal cord proper, with forceps) (see Figure 1K). Next, peel off the meninges from the spinal cord in the rostral-to-caudal direction, by sweeping between the outer surface of spinal cords and meninges, with the forceps. As shown in Figure 1C, at this point, we obtain the spinal cords from the cervical to lumbar levels (by cutting the open-book spinal cord with forceps).Preparation of spinal cord explant cultureFor dSC (-FP) explants: immediately dissect out the dorsal half of the spinal cords (see the cutting lines shown in Figure 1E) with a tungsten needle (Figure 1H).For SC (+FP) explants: immediately cut the spinal cord at the opposite edge of the FP (Figure 1E) with a tungsten needle.Note: Do not pool open-book spinal cords or the dSC (-FP)/SC (+FP) explants.",
    "If pooled, they will become curled and very difficult to mount onto the NC filter. When one explant is ready, start the Step B5c. We usually mark the dorso-caudal corner of the explants by cutting diagonally (Figure 1F). Using a wet pipette (it should be noted that explants can easily adhere to dry surfaces and be damaged), immediately transfer the dSC (-FP) or SC (+FP) explant into a coverslip- and Medium 3-containing dish. Spread the explant on a strip of the ConA-coated black NC filter (Figures 1F, 1J and 1L). To fix the position of the explant, nail the explant on the NC filter by using blunt forceps, without using real “nails”, and with the pial side downward (Figure 1L (i)). For dSC (-FP) explants, an extra care not to include any piece of FP tissues into the dish should be taken. We strongly recommend mounting the spinal cord one by one, and immediately after the meninges are peeled off.Notes: Use un-cut pipettes for transferring the excised spinal cord explant ready for mounting. The un-cut pipettes, rather than cut pipettes, are suitable for handling small pieces of nerual tissues. For preparing retinal explants, researchers usually “blot” retinal tissues that are spread on the NC filter, further onto a dry filter paper, so that the retina becomes firmly attached to the NC filter (e.g., see Bonhoeffer and Huf, 1982). However, we found that this procedure does not improve axon growth in spinal cord explants and may even compromise tissue integrity. Thus, we do not perform the blotting procedure to prepare spinal cord explants. Have two spinal cords mounted on the NC filters. Using forceps, place them in parallel on the Matrigel-coated coverslips in the Medium 3-containing 35 mm dish.",
    "Reverse the spinal cord explant-mounted filter strips, and hold them with a pair of stainless metal weights (from right above, gently place the weights to stabilize the two NC strips) (Figures 1G and 1M). Now the ventricular side of the spinal cord is contacting the Matrigel-coated surface of the coverslip. Incubate the dish at 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 48 h. In our experiments, the cultures were treated with Slit ligand (see Materials and Reagents D.10.). Usually, we do not replace media during 48 h cultivation, before performing ligand stimulation and fixation.Notes:During the flipping step, do not put out the explant on the medium. Although netrin-1 has been used to promote axon growth in dSC (-FP) explants (e.g., Zou et al., 2000), we do not use netrin-1, irrespective of dSC (-FP) and SC (+FP) explant cultures. Thus, we have examined effects of Slit alone on Robo1 receptor expression (Kinoshita-Kawada et al., 2019). Examine axon outgrowth in the explant culture under a phase-contrast microscope. Much more axons should extend from the ventral side of the explants. Under the conditions used, the axonal front should reach a distance of 500 μm or more from the explant after 48 h in culture.For ligand stimulation, we usually remove the half volume (1 ml) of the culture medium and add 1 ml of the ligand-containing fresh medium. After ligand stimulation, perform fixation of the explant cultures at room temperature for 1 h, by adding 4% PFA plus 10% sucrose in PBS. Immediately before fixation, remove the metal weights carefully. Wash the fixed explants three times with PBS each for 30-60 min, and finally add PBS + 0.025% NaN3 for storage. The explants can be subjected to immunostaining.",
    "Handle with extra care not to detach the explants from the coverslip during fixation, washing and immunostaining steps.ImmunostainingWe usually perform immunostaining of the cultured explants 1 day or later after fixation, which gives better results of immunostaining for Robo receptors and L1.Permeabilize the cultured explants with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min at room temperature.Wash three times with PBS for 5 min each.Block the samples with blocking buffer 1 containing 3% BSA, 0.1% skim milk and 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature.Incubate the explants with the primary antibodies that are diluted in blocking buffer 1 at 4 °C overnight (for approximately 18-20 h). In our experiments, we usually use anti-Robo rabbit polyclonal antibody and anti-L1 (2C2) or anti-TAG-1 (4D7).Wash three times with PBS (30-60 min each).Block the samples with blocking buffer 2 containing 3% BSA, 3% goat serum, 0.1% skim milk and 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature.Incubate the explants with the secondary antibodies that are diluted in blocking buffer 2 for 2 h at room temperature. In our experiments, we used Alexa488-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies and Alexa555-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (or IgM) secondary antibodies.Wash three times with PBS (30-60 min each).Incubate the explants with Alexa647-conjugated anti-β-tubulin, class III antibody (TuJ1) that is diluted in blocking buffer 2 for 2 h at room temperature.Wash three times with PBS (30-60 min each).Mount the samples onto glass slides with PermaFluor, usually on the day of observation. The mounted samples are not well maintained for a long time. They should be photographed soon.Ex vivo electroporation (EP) and spinal cord explant cultureThe following procedure can be performed outside the laminar flow hood.",
    "Spinal cords are dissected from mouse embryos after DNA injection and EP, and are cultured as “closed-book” explants in collagen matrix at 37 °C at 5% CO2 for 4 days (Figures 2A-2H). During this culture period, vYFP-expressing commissural axons reach, cross the ventral midline and turn longitudinally in control spinal cord preparations (Figure 2I). The effects of gene knockdown and knockout can be evaluated in terms of midline axon guidance.Dissect out E11.5 mouse embryos into HCMF, as described above. Select the embryos appropriate for EP by performing accurate staging of mouse embryos.Note: It is important that the curving morphology of the neural tube of the embryos matches the shape of the electrode. In our hands, the stages just before E11.5 are appropriate for introduction of plasmids/shRNAs to pre-crossing neurons by EP and axon midline crossing in situ. E10.5-11.0 spinal cords are difficult to electroporate efficiently and to prepare the explants in subsequent steps, resulting in insufficient labeling of midline-crossing axons. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Injection of an axon-tracer plasmid into the neural tube of a mouse embryo. This video shows an experiment of DNA injection into E11.5 mouse spinal cord before EP under a dissecting microscope. (This video was made at Fukuoka Univ., according to guidelines from the Fukuoka Univ. on Animal Care and approved by the Animal Research Ethics Board of Fukuoka University under protocol # 1815122.)To perform ex utero EP, place an embryo in a new 100 mm dish containing an enough volume of cold sterile DPBS under a dissecting microscope. Manually inject spinal cords of E11.5 embryos with a solution containing shRNA constructs (2 μg/μl) and pCAG-vYFP (0.4 μg/μl) supplemented with 0.05-0.1% Fast Green and diluted in DPBS (Video 1). Immediately thereafter, electroporate embryos unilaterally with three 50-ms pulses of 20 V at 50-ms intervals (for E11.",
    "5 ICR embryos) by using the NEPA21 electroporator (Nepa Gene) and forceps-type electrodes (CUY665P9-6-2-5, Nepa Gene) (Figures 2E and 2F). Just before performing EP, sandwich the injected embryo gently between two electrodes (we set the cathode left-side and the anode right-side) and press the foot switch of the NEPA21 machine. Wait until EP is finished. Do not sandwich the embryo with the electrodes too tightly during EP. If too tightly sandwiched, the injected DNA solution will leak out, and the embryo may be damaged during EP.Notes: If different types of PBS are used, the actual electric conditions for EP of embryos may become dramatically different. We recommend testing several kinds of PBS for EP, in terms of gene transfer efficiency and tissue integrity. In addition, if we continue to use the same DPBS for EP of many embryos, the current flowed and electric energy tend to increase remarkably, which also affects tissue integrity. We use fresh DPBS in a new dish for every 3 embryos. Inject a sufficient volume of DNA solution into the cavity of the neural tube (two approaches are presented in Figure 2A), but too much volume does not increase the efficiency of gene transfer into the spinal cord, because the DNA tends to leak from the embryo after a blowout of the neural tube. EP pulses make the embryonic tissues, especially FP regions fragile. For getting the best results in EP, in terms of the location and efficiency of gene transfer, sufficient practice will be required.",
    "If the EP efficiency is too low even after practice, consider whether the shape of your electrodes matches the curving morphology of spinal cords of the embryos, and the electric condition of EP may have to be modified (efficient EP depends on the types of electrodes, pulse voltage, width, numbers and intervals as well as damping factors).This video shows an experiment of DNA injection into E11.5 mouse spinal cord before EP under a dissecting microscope.

    "Immediately after EP, transfer the embryo into numbered 35 mm dishes containing L-15 media. Keep them on ice for recovery. After performing EP of each embryo, gently wipe the electrodes with 70% ethanol.Note: We found that the tissue integrity of eletroporated spinal cords is better when keeping in L-15 than in HCMF. After finishing all the EP steps, clean up the electrodes, brush them softly using a toothbrush (or a cotton swab) and toothpaste. Wash them with distilled water and finally with 70% ethanol, and let them air-dry. After EP of all the embryos are finished, transfer the embryos to fresh HCMF-containing dishes and dissect out spinal cords carefully, one-by-one. When isolating the electroporated spinal cord from the embryo, we usually start dissection from the regions near the roof plate, to avoid damaging the FP. Do not remove the meninges from the spinal cord. Prepare the closed-book explant, with the meninges attached.Note: We recover the electroporated spinal cords from the cervical to lumbar levels for explant culture. In our hands, successful vYFP expression in the spinal cord, robust axon extension toward the ventral region and axon midline crossing were observed usually from the upper-limbs to lower-limbs levels. Embed each isolated spinal cord in collagen gel. Before starting embedding, have acid collagen solution, 5x concentrated medium (DMEM/F12) and reconstruction buffer, and keep them on ice. Mix 7 volumes of acid collagen solution (for example, 350 μl/tube, in our experiments) and 2 volumes of 5x concentrated medium (DMEM/F12) (for example, 100 μl/tube) and keep on ice until use. Just before use, add approximately 0.9-1 volume of reconstruction buffer (for example, 45 μl/tube) to the above mixture, mix well by pipetting and if needed, adjust pH to ~7.4 by referring to the color of phenol red included in the mixture.",
    "When kept on ice or at 4 °C, the collagen mixture can be maintained in the sol state for a while. When kept at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator, the mixture will gelatinize.Place one spinal cord per 35 mm dish (we usually keep the FP the right side [Figure 2G], so that the electroplated side of the spinal cord is located upward). Cover a “closed-book” preparation of the explant with 120 μl of the sol-state collagen mixture and incubate in a CO2 incubator to gelatinize collagen for 15-30 min (not too long). When the collagen has gelatinized, add 2-2.5 ml of Medium 4 to the dish slowly.Culture at 37 °C for 4 days (exchange daily the half volume, ~1 ml, of the medium).After 4 days of culture, dissect out spinal cords from collagen gel. Transfer them into PBS or HCMF. Remove the meninges, cut the roof plate and prepare open-book preparations. Fix the spinal cord with 4% PFA in PBS on Sylgard-coated dissection dishes for 15 min at room temperature (for this fixation step, Sylgard-coated dishes appear to be much better than usual culture dishes). Continue fixation as immersion fixation of the spinal cord at 4 °C overnight. Wash the spinal cords twice with PBS and finally replace with PBS + 0.025% NaN3 for storage.Notes:When recovering the spinal cords from the gel, their appearance should be similar to those before cultivation, without remarkable swelling. If so different, consider the milder EP condition (e.g., try fewer pulses, lower voltages). Use 4% PFA in PBS without sucrose for fixation. In the presence of sucrose in the fixative, spinal cords will be floating and damaged due to surface tension. We do not use collagenase to recover the spinal cords from the gel. Mount the electroprated spinal cords for observation.",
    "Transfer the open-book spinal cord explant, together with PBS, onto a 24 x 60 mm rectangular coverslip, remove most of PBS, add PermaFluor and cover the explant with another coverslip (same size) to make a sandwich. Visualize them under a confocal microscope. We acquire confocal stacks of green-channel images for visualizing vYFP signals and DIC images to show the accurate FP position. We usually observe the spinal cord explant first from the ventricular side and then from the pial side, when necessary."
