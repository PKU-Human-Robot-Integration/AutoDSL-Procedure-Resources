    "Bone explant culturePrepare washing and growth media before mouse sacrifice.Keep 10 ml washing medium on ice to keep the bones in until culture.Place the growth medium in a 37°C water bath.Sacrifice the mice by cervical dislocation (or any other appropriate method).Rinse the animal thoroughly with 10 ml 70% ethanol.Bone isolation (Time: 10 min/mouse, requires 2 scissors and 2 forceps)Incise the skin of the inguinal region using scissors and remove it entirely from the hindlimbs. Disconnect the hindlimbs (femur with attached tibia) from the trunk by cutting at the femoral head with scissors. Place the hindlimbs in a sterile 100-mm Petri dish (Note 3, see Figure 1A).Cut at the knee junction to separate the tibia from the femur. Remove the soft tissue using forceps and scissors. Avoid taking hair and fat (see Figure 1A).Place the bones (femurs and tibias) in a 50-ml conical tube containing 15 ml washing medium on ice until all the bones have been isolated (see Notes 4 and 5).Bone marrow cell removal (Time: 2 min/bone, requires 2 scissors and 2 forceps)Under a cell culture hood, place the bones into a dish containing 10 ml washing medium.Cut the epiphyses just below the end of the marrow cavity using sterile scissors.Place the diaphysis into an empty Petri dish.Insert a 25 G needle with a 1-ml syringe filled with 1 ml growth medium into the bone marrow cavity and flush out the bone marrow. Repeat this step at least 3 times, until the bone becomes white (Notes 6 and 7, see Figure 1A).Place the flushed bones into a 50-ml tube containing 5 ml ice-cold growth medium for periosteal cell isolation.Periosteal cell cultureRemove the growth medium and wash the bones by rinsing 3 times with fresh growth medium.",
    "Place all 12 bones into a 60-mm TPP culture dish (in the center of the dish, each bone separated by 0.3 cm, see Figure 1B).Cover the bones by adding drops of growth medium at 37°C (around 1 ml in total, see Note 8).Place the bones in a humid CO2 incubator at 33°C or 37°C and 5% CO2 (see Note 9).Change the medium daily. Carefully aspirate the medium and replace with fresh growth medium. Place the dish back at 33°C or 37°C (see Notes 10 and 11). Cell migration usually starts after 2 or 3 days.When cell migration is observed (Figure 1C), add 2-3 ml growth medium. Change the medium daily.When PCs have sufficiently migrated from the explant (usually after 2 weeks), gently remove the explants from the dish using sterile forceps, wash once with 1× PBS, and add 5 ml fresh growth medium to cover the cells (Figure 1C).Allow the cells to grow for 4-5 more days. Change the medium daily.When PCs reach 80% confluence around the explant site, remove the medium and add 3 ml trypsin. Place the plate back into the incubator for 3 min. Detach PCs using a cell scraper and transfer the cells to a 50-ml Falcon tube containing 10 ml growth medium.Centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 10 ml growth medium. Plate the cells into a 100-mm TPP plate.Replace the medium every 2-3 days with fresh growth medium.When PCs reach 80% confluence, cells can be trypsinized for further passage (Figure 1D). For experiments, PCs can be used from P0 (Notes 12, 13, and 14).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4107/bioprotoc-11-15-4107-g001.jpgFigure 1. Steps of bone explant culture.

Place the plate back into the incubator for 3 min. Detach PCs using a cell scraper and transfer the cells to a 50-ml Falcon tube containing 10 ml growth medium.Centrifuge at 300 × g for 10 min.Count the cells and keep only the number of cells needed for the experiment: 105 cells per host animal.Place 105 cells in a 1.5-ml sterile Eppendorf tube (one tube for each host animal). Centrifuge for 10 min at 300 × g and remove as much medium as possible.Prepare appropriate volumes of fibrin (F) and thrombin (T) diluted 1:4 in distilled water: 105 cells are resuspended in 15 μl F (diluted 1:4) + 15 μl T (diluted 1:4) per host animal (see Note 19).Add 15 μl diluted fibrin to the tubes containing cells. Resuspend by pipetting without forming bubbles.Add 15 μl diluted thrombin to form a solid gel (see Note 20).Allow the matrix to polymerize for 15 min on ice. If the pellet is well formed, it can be easily grabbed with the tip of forceps (Figure 4E).Keep the tubes at 4°C on ice until transplantation.Surgery for in vivo transplantationAnesthetize mice with intraperitoneal injection of 50 mg/kg ketamine and 1 mg/kg medetomidine (Note 21).Inject 0.",
