    "The protocol for obtaining discarded human tissue from surgical patients and the establishment of primary cultures was approved by the University of Texas Medical Branch and University of New Mexico Institutional Review Boards. The general requirements for the procurement of human tissue specimens is described below. Note that since MFs may be isolated from frozen tissue, biobanks and commercial vendors are also viable options.\n1. Obtain Human Tissue\nSubmit a protocol to obtain human colon tissue to the institutional review board for approval.\nEstablish collaborations with general surgeons and/or colorectal surgeons in order to obtain human tissue for research. Collaboration with the pathology department is also mandatory as they will be determining the tissue that is not required for diagnosis and may be designated for research.\nAdvise the pathologist to provide tissue from the neoplasm and then grossly normal mucosa at least 5 cm from the tumor. Immediately place the samples in ice-cold wash media and place on ice. The pathologist will determine the amount of tissue that can be safely given for research. The minimal tissue required for MF isolation is 1.5 mm2.\nUse the obtained tissue either immediately to establish the primary cultures or freeze and place at -80 °C for future isolation.\n\t\nIf freezing for later isolation, cut the tissue into approximately 1 - 2 mm2 pieces, place into a cryogenic tube with 1 ml of freeze media (see below), and store at -80 °C. Note: Utilizing this protocol, successful isolation of MFs from tissue frozen for over 4 years has been observed.\n2. Prepare Reagents",
    "For Collagenase solution: Prepare 100 U/ml collagenase I, II and IV in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) with Ca2+/Mg2+ (see Materials Table). CAUTION: Collagenase active unit concentration and purity may varies from vendor to vendor, which may impede the efficiency of the tissue digestion and/or preservation of the epitope on the mucosal cell surface. To prevent these potential pitfalls, use collagenase with highest degree of purity (≥95%) and prepare the stock solution based on the active units concentration.\nPrepare Water-based DNase stock solution at 10 mg/ml (3.55 UA/mg).\nPrepare Wash media: (MEM: 89 ml, Antibiotic-Antimycotic, 100x: 1 ml; heat-inactivated FCS: 10 ml)\nPrepare Fibroblast growth media: MEM: 500 ml bottle; L-glutamine (200 mM): 5 ml; MEM non-essential amino acids, 100x solution: 5 ml; ciprofloxacin HCl (10 mg/ml): 570 µl; Antibiotic-Antimycotic, 100x solution: 10 ml; sodium pyruvate (100 mM): 5 ml; heat-inactivated FCS: 50 ml\nPrepare Freeze media: Fibroblast growth media (Reagent 2.4) with the addition of 10% Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO), then filter-sterilize with a 0.22 µm filter.\n3. Enzymatically Digest Human Tissue\nIf the tissue was frozen in freeze media, place cryovial in warm (~ 37 °C) water until tissue and media is thawed.\nFor 4 - 5 of 2 mm2 pieces of tissue, wash tissue twice with 10 ml of HBSS without Ca2+/Mg2+.\nOnce tissue has settled by gravity, carefully discard the supernatant without spinning sample.\nAdd 10 ml of the collagenase solution to the sample and transfer the tissue-solution mixture into a sterile, DNase/RNase-free tube with built-in rotors for sample dissociation. Use collagenase to dissociate the extracellular matrix which surrounds the basal aspect of epithelial cells and forms the non-cellular fraction of the mucosal lamina propria.",
    "Tightly close tube and attach it upside down onto the sleeve of the dissociator (e.g., GentleMACs). If the lab does not have the access to the aforementioned equipment, increase the time of each digestion step to obtain comparable results.\nRun the Program h_tumor_01, a pre-set profile included with the machine (total duration of 36 sec, with intermittent pulses ranging from 1,000 - 4,000 rpm, with 268 rounds per run).\nAfter termination of the program, detach tube from the dissociator.\nIncubate sample for 45 min at 37 °C under continuous rotation on shaker at 140 rpm. Note: For varying amounts of tissue samples, time of digestion can be proportionally reduced or increased (i.e., larger amounts of tissue may require additional time).\nAttach tube upside down onto the sleeve of the dissociator.\nChoose and run the Program h_tumor_02 (total duration of 37 sec, with intermittent pulses ranging from 1,000 - 4,000 rpm, with 235 rounds per run).\nAfter termination of the program, detach tube from the dissociator.\nAdd 50 µl of DNase stock solution. Use DNAse to dissociate/remove dead cells and DNA fraction of cellular debris that leads to cell clumping.\nIncubate sample for 30 min at 37 °C under continuous rotation on shaker at 60 rpm.\nAttach tube upside down onto the sleeve of the dissociator again.\nChoose and run the Program h_tumor_03 (total duration of 37 sec, with intermittent pulses ranging from 1,000 - 4,000 rpm, with 168 rounds per run).\n\tNote: If the tissue is not completely digested, centrifuge at 250 × g for 10 min at 20 °C, discard supernatant, resuspend in 2 ml of cell dissociation solution and incubate at RT for 10 min.\nPass the cell suspension through sterile 70 µm cell strainer.",
    "Centrifuge cell suspension at 250 × g for 10 min at 20 °C. Aspirate supernatant completely.\nWash cell pellet twice with 25 ml of HBSS without Ca2+/Mg2+ and discard the supernatant.\nPrior to the last wash, count cell number using an automated cell counting system available in the laboratory or manually using hemocytometer. For MF primary culture generation proceed for step 3.19.1, for the analysis or sorting of MFs using flow cytometry proceed for step 3.19.2.\n\t\nFor isolation and growth of pure MF culture (Figure 1), discard the supernatant from last centrifugation, resuspend cell pellet in the appropriate amount of fibroblast isolation media needed to seed up to 4 x 106 cells in 3 ml of the media per well in 6 well, cell culture-treated plates. Proceed to step 3.20.\nFor the analysis or sorting of MFs using flow cytometry, place up to 2 x 106 in 2 ml of fibroblast isolation media in 24 well, low-binding plate and incubate O/N at 37 °C with 5% CO2. This is to restore the cell surface epitopes that may be affected by the enzymatic procedure. Then collect cell suspension and count recovered cells and proceed for the immunostaining and flow cytometry analysis8.\nGrow cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Change media every 2 - 3 days until formation of ~ 80% confluent MF monolayer (Figure 1D-E).\nPassage cells in T25 flasks with from 6 well plate at ratio 1:1 and grow for ~ 10 - 14 days in fibroblast growth media to achieve 80 - 100% confluency.",
    "Expand culture by passaging cells from T25 to T75 cells at ratio 1:2. Once cells reach confluency, use one flask for the analysis of isolated MF purity using by flow cytometry as described previously5. Freeze or passage another T75 flask of MF culture at ratio 1:3.\n\tNote: When analyzed by flow cytometry, it is expected that GI mucosa stromal MF of mesenchymal origin when growing in culture will have following phenotype: EpCAM-, CD31-, CD45-, vimentin+, α-SMA+, CD90+.\nSubscription Required.
