    "1. Preparing Flies to be Assayed\nCulture flies on standard molasses/cornmeal media at incubator set at 25 °C and 65% humidity. Take care to not overcrowd the vials. For example, put 8 females and 6 males into a narrow food vial.\n\tNote: The \"narrow food vial\" used here has an inner diameter of 2.3 cm. We typically dispensed about 10 ml of fly food into each vial. The fly food recipe we used is described here: http://flystocks.bio.indiana.edu/Fly_Work/media-recipes/molassesfood.html.\n2 - 3 days after females eclosion, prepare vials with fresh yeast paste as shown in Figure 1E. Make fresh yeast paste by mixing 6 g of active yeast with 10 ml of 0.5 % proprionic acid. Use a spatula to apply the yeast paste onto the sidewall of the food vials. Collect 30 - 35 eclosed females together with 20 - 25 males into the vials.\n\t\nIn general, collect the males from the same vials where the females are collected (so as to save time and effort). However, if there is concern about the fertility of males, use WT males instead. Also, yeast paste is important for stimulating egg production therefore prepare it fresh daily.\nMaintain the collected females/males at 25 °C, 65% humidity, unless the flies are temperature sensitive.\nAfter ~4 - 5 days, check the vials to see if females are ready for egg-laying experiments. They are ready when the surface of the food medium is wet from larvae actively burrowing in the food (see Figure 1E - F).\n\tNote: Females typically withhold laying eggs once the food surface becomes wet and crawling with larvae. This step ensures that females would be ready to lay many eggs when they encounter substrates with desired texture (e.g., ~1% agarose).\n2. Chamber Construction, Assembly, Assay Setup",
    "Have a machine shop build acrylic egg-laying chambers (Figure 1A - D). The engineering drawing of different pieces were shown in Supplementary Figure 1 - 3. High resolution pictures can also be found here (http://www.rebeccayang.org/pdf/chamber%20design.pdf).\nInsert plastic sheets into loading (top) piece of the chamber as shown in Figure 1C. This serves as the bottom surface while loading flies into individual egg-laying arenas.\nAnesthetize females on a CO2 pad and load them individually into each egg-laying arena. Allow ~30 min for flies to recover from the CO2 and to become acclimated to the new environment.\nPrepare the agarose substrates.\n\t\nFor convenience, keep a premade bottle of melted 1% agarose in a 55 °C water bath.\nAdd the desired amount of stock sucrose solution (2 M) into a 50 ml conical tube and mixing it with appropriate amount of agarose. For example, to prepare the 150 mM sucrose substrate, place 750 µl of 2 M sucrose solution into the tube and then fill the tube with agarose to the 10 ml mark.\nPrepare the plain substrate in the same manner but add distilled water instead of sucrose solution.\n\t\tNote: The final concentration of agarose in this protocol is slightly less than 1%. In our experience, the exact concentration of agarose does not matter so long as it is controlled to be within ~0.9 - 1.1% and that the two substrates are of the same agarose concentration.\nTake the substrate (bottom) piece of the chamber and pipette 1,000 µl of agarose substrate into each trough as seen in Figure 1D.\nAllow agarose to solidify for ~30 min.\nOnce the agarose substrates and flies are ready, assemble all three pieces of the egg-laying chamber and then take out the plastic sheets.\nPlace the chambers in fly incubators.",
    "Note: Length of egg-laying experiments can vary depending on experimental needs. We typically run the experiment O/N (14 - 16 hr). Also, no significant impact of circadian timing on egg-laying preferences was observed.\nAnesthetize females by injecting CO2 into the chamber. Disassemble the chamber, discard the anesthetized flies into fly morgue (i.e., an empty coffee can filled with some corn oil). Take pictures of the results for recordkeeping (see Figure 2).\nCount the number of eggs manually and calculate preference indices for analysis. Calculate preference index as (Na - Nb)/(Na + Nb) where Na and Nb represent number of eggs on site a vs. site b, respectively.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
