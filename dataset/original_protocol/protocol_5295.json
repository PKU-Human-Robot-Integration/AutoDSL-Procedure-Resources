    "MOG immunizationPerform MOG immunization in the same way as Part I. A. MOG immunization in mice, except for the number of mice to be immunized. Usually, 3-4 mice are sufficient to obtain MOG-specific T cells lines.Culture and passage of T cell linesCollect inguinal lymph nodes (iLNs) from MOG immunized mice (3-4 mice) on day 9 or 10 (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170628/20170628180215_0184.jpgFigure 2. The location of the inguinal lymph nodes (iLN). iLN of the immunized C57BL/6 mouse.Homogenize the iLNs on a cell strainer in a 50 ml tube using the plunger from a 2.5 ml syringe.Centrifuge the tubes (600 x g, 5 min, 4 °C) and aspirate the supernatant.Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml/tube RBC lysis buffer (see Recipe 1) and incubate on ice for 1 min.Add plain RPMI medium up to 50 ml/tube.Centrifuge the tubes (600 x g, 5 min, 4 °C) and aspirate the supernatant.Resuspend the cells in 2 ml IM20 medium (see Recipe 5).Filter the cells using a cell strainer. Count the cells.Seed 2.5 x 105 cells/well/200 μl iLN cells in the presence of 4 μg/ml MOG peptide, 0.5 ng/ml IL-1β, 5 ng/ml IL-6 and 0.5 ng/ml IL-23 in 96-well U-bottom plates for 10 to 14 days.Proceed to step C1.T cell preparationCollect CD4+ T-cell-rich iLN cells from 96U plates in a 10-cm dish by gently pipetting 2 to 3 times using a multichannel pipette.Collect the cells into 50 ml tubes and centrifuge (600 x g, 5 min, 4 °C).Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the T cells in 5 ml IM20 medium.Count the cells and adjust the concentration to 2.5 x 105 cells/ml.Irradiation of splenocytesCollect the spleens of naive C57BL/6 mice and homogenize using the plunger from a 2.5 ml syringe.Add plain RPMI medium up to 50 ml/tube and centrifuge (600 x g, 5 min, 4 °C).",
    "Aspirate the supernatant and add 1 ml/spleen RBC lysis buffer.Add plain RPMI medium up to 50 ml and centrifuge (600 x g, 5 min, 4 °C).Irradiate the cells at 35 Gy, centrifuge (600 x g, 5 min, 4 °C) and aspirate the supernatant.Suspend the irradiated splenocytes in 10 ml IM20 medium, count and adjust the concentration to 2.5 x 106 cells/ml.In vitro stimulationMix 2.5 x 105 cells/ml CD4+ T-cell-rich iLN cells and 2.5 x 106 cells/ml irradiated splenocytes at 1:1.Seed the cells at 200 μl/well containing 4 μg/ml MOG peptide, 0.5 ng/ml IL-1β, 5 ng/ml IL-6 and 0.5 ng/ml IL-23 in 96-well U-bottom plates.Incubate the co-cultured cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 10-14 days.Repeat steps C1 to E3 to enrich the percentage of MOG-specific CD4+ T cells from total iLN cells (Figure 3). Use fresh irradiated splenocytes in each repeating cycle.Notes: T cells can be frozen after step E3 in CellBanker or equivalent solution at -80 °C. When thawing, use a 37 °C water bath, and wash the cells in plain RPMI medium. Then, the T cell line can be used for culture (start from step E1).Typically, more than 95% of live cells will be CD4+ T cells after four rounds of in vitro stimulation (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170628/20170628180707_9411.jpgFigure 3. Representative FACS plots of a T cell line. Most living cells (> 95%) are CD4+ T cells (CD19- T cell receptor (TCR)β+CD90.2+CD4+ T cells) after 5 days of the fourth round of in vitro stimulation (Procedure E). Irradiated splenocytes can be seen as forward scatter (FSC)low, side scatter (SSC)low dead cells.Adoptive transfer of T cell linesSet up culture the same way as ‘E. In vitro stimulation’.Note: Do not forget to add 4 μg/ml MOG peptide, 0.5 ng/ml IL-1β, 5 ng/ml IL-6 and 0.5 ng/ml IL-23.",
    "Seed these cells at 200 μl/well in 96-well U-bottom plates (about 5 plates for 1 mouse).Incubate the co-cultured cells in 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 days.Collect the cells from the 96-well U-bottom plates in a 10-cm dish by gently pipetting 2 to 3 times with a multichannel pipette.Collect the cells in 50 ml tubes and centrifuge (600 x g, 5 min, 4 °C).Aspirate the medium and resuspend the cells in 1 ml plain RPMI medium.Count the cells and adjust the concentration to 2.5-3.75 x 107/ml.Note: Count only living cells.Inject 1-1.5 x 107 cells i.v. into C57BL/6 mice.Measure clinical scores as described previously (Huseby et al., 2001; Ogura et al., 2008; Arima et al., 2012 and 2015b)."
