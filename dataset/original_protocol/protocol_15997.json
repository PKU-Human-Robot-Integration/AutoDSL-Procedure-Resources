    "This protocol is used to obtain a well-differentiated human bronchial epithelium in vitro. In brief, undifferentiated cells are first expanded in T-175 flasks and then seeded onto permeable membrane supports to follow differentiation. Cultivating HAE under ALI conditions and with specific cell culture medium will result in a multilayered epithelium with similar morphology and physiology as observed in vivo, which includes beating cilia, production and transport of mucus, and expression of antiviral and pro-inflammatory cytokines.\nMaterials\nPneumacultTM-EX Complete medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-rec-0009])\nNormal human bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells (Lonza; cat. no.

    "1. Working in a certified class II biological safety cabinet, add 25 ml of PneumacultTM-EX Complete medium to a T-175 flask.\n2. Warm the medium by incubating the flask in the 37°C incubator for 30 min.\n3. Remove the epithelial cells from cryostorage and thaw rapidly in a water bath at 37°C.\nCAUTION: If removing cells from a cryostorage unit containing liquid nitrogen, use safety goggles and cryogenic gloves to avoid burns.\n4. Add one vial of cells (if using Lonza cat. no. CC2540S; or < 2 × 106 cells if thawing another cryopreserved stock) to the T-175 flask and disperse the cells by rocking the flask.\nAlternatively, you may very gently homogenize the cells using a serological pipette; however, excessive or vigorous pipetting can reduce cell viability.\n5. Label the flask with the following information: donor number/date/passage number.\nThis is “passage 0” because it is the first time the primary cells are cultured in a flask.\n6. Incubate the culture overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2.\n7. The following day, discard the medium from the flask and replace it with 25 ml of fresh, warm PneumacultTM-EX Complete medium.\nWarm only the amount of medium to be used in a water bath at 37°C for 10 min.\n8. Incubate the culture overnight at 37°C with 5% CO2.\n9. Every 2 days, change the medium as described above (steps 7-8).\n10. Subculture the cells when the monolayer achieves 80% confluence (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-fig-0002], see “day 6” photo).\nPhase 2: Sub-culture normal human bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells\nSub-cultivation is done to amplify the number of undifferentiated human airway epithelial cells, which will enable the researcher to either seed a larger number of Transwells or cryopreserve a portion of the cells for use in future experiments with cells from the same donor.",
    "11. Discard the medium from the T-175 flask.\n12. Wash once with 10 ml of PBS (without Ca2+ or Mg2+) at room temperature.\n13. Add 10 ml of warm 0.025% trypsin/EDTA.\nIncubate the trypsin/EDTA for 10 min in a water bath at 37°C to warm it up.\n14. Incubate the flask for 5 min at 37°C.\n15. Visualize the cells using a light microscope. If the cells are detached, proceed with step 16; otherwise return the flask to the 37°C incubator and monitor every 1-2 min.\nProlonged incubation in trypsin can reduce cell viability. Check cells often during dissociation. Tapping the flask against the palm of your hand may help to release the cells.\n16. Add 10 ml of the trypsin inhibitor solution (TIS).\n17. Gently homogenize the cell suspension using a serological pipette, then transfer the cell suspension to a 50-ml conical tube.\n18. Centrifuge for 5 min at 350 × g, room temperature.\n19. Discard the supernatant by pipetting.\n20. Dislodge the pellet by flicking the tube and gently resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml of warm PneumacultTM-EX Complete medium.\nWarm only the amount of medium to be used in a water bath at 37°C for 10 min.\n21. Count the number of viable cells using a hemocytometer or a cell counter.\nMix 1:1 (v/v) cells with 0.4% trypan blue solution; viable cells are colorless (unstained). Also see Strober (2001).\n22. Seed 1.75 × 106 cells (10,000 cells/cm2) into a T-175 flask and bring the final volume in the flask up to 20 ml with warm PneumacultTM-EX Complete medium.\nRepeat this step with the rest of the cell suspension and new T-175 flasks.\n23. Label the flask with the following information: donor number/date of sub-cultivation/passage number.",
    "Now, this will be “passage 1” because it is the first time these cells are subcultured.\n24. Incubate the flask at 37°C with 5% CO2.\n25. Every 2 days, change the medium as described above (Phase 1, steps 7-8).\n26. When the monolayer achieves 80% confluence, sub-culture one more time (Phase 2) or start the process of cell differentiation (step 33, below).\nUndifferentiated cells can be passaged up to twice under these conditions; further sub-culturing may affect the efficiency of the differentiation process.\nPhase 3: Coat Transwells with collagen\n27. Place the 6.5-mm Transwells into 24-well plates.\n28. Add 100 μl Collagen Type I–rat tail working solution to the apical chamber (on the Transwell membrane).\n29. Incubate the plates for 45 min in the 37°C incubator.\n30. Gently aspirate the collagen from the apical chamber using a micropipette.\nAlternatively, a 200-μl non-barrier tip can be attached to a 2-ml aspirating pipette and used with vacuum suction to remove fluid from the Transwell. Take care to remove the fluid without damaging the membrane.\n31. Wash the membrane once with 150 μl of PBS followed by immediate removal.\n32. Store the plates at 4°C until use.\nCollagen-coated Transwells can be stored for several weeks, although longevity will vary based on storage conditions.\nPhase 4: Pre-differentiation/expansion phase—Seed undifferentiated epithelial cells on Transwells\n33. Follow steps 11-21 from Phase 2 (sub-culturing), then resuspend the cells at 3.3 × 105 cells/ml.\n34. Transfer 100 μl of cell suspension (33,000 cells) to a collagen-coated Transwell membrane.\nRepeat this process with the remaining cell suspension or until the desired number of Transwell cultures are obtained. Be careful not to spill any of the cells into the basolateral chamber, as they will continue to grow and expand even after air-lift.",
    "35. Add 500 μl of warm PneumacultTM-EX Complete medium to the basolateral chamber.\nWarm only the amount of medium to be used in a water bath at 37°C for 10 min. Avoid trapping air bubbles underneath the Transwell.\n36. Label the plates with the following information: donor number/date/passage number.\n37. Incubate the plate at 37°C with 5% CO2.\n38. The following day, aspirate and discard the medium from the apical Transwell chamber.\n39. Wash the monolayer by adding 100 μl of PBS at room temperature to the apical Transwell chamber and then removing it by aspiration.\n40. Add 200 μl warm PneumacultTM-EX Complete medium to the apical chamber.\nWarm only the amount of medium to be used in a water bath at 37°C for 10 min.\n41. Discard the basolateral medium and replace it with 500 μl fresh, warm PneumacultTM-EX Complete medium.\n42. Incubate the cultures at 37°C with 5% CO2.\n43. Change the medium in both the apical and basolateral chambers every 2 days, as described above (steps 38, 40-42).\n44. Visualize the cultures daily under a light microscope to monitor expansion and growth on the Transwell.\n45. When the monolayer is 100% confluent, proceed to Phase 5 (differentiation).\nUsually, it takes 3-5 days for the monolayer to achieve full confluency.\nPhase 5: Differentiation phase—Culture human airway epithelial cells at air-liquid interface (HAE-ALI)\n46. When the monolayer achieves 100% confluency (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-fig-0002]), discard the medium from both the apical and basolateral chambers.\n47. Add 500 μl warm PneumaCult-ALI Maintenance medium to the basolateral chamber. The apical chamber will remain dry (air-lift).\nWarm only the amount of medium to be used in a water bath at 37°C for 10 min.\n48. Mark the plate with the date of air-lift.\n49. Incubate the plates at 37°C with 5% CO2.",
    "50. Every 2 days, discard the medium from the basolateral chamber and replace it with 500 μl warm PneumaCult-ALI Maintenance medium. Return cultures to the 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.\nIf liquid is observed in the apical chamber, remove it by gentle aspiration to preserve the air-liquid interface.\n51. Visualize the cultures under a microscope frequently. You will be able to visualize cilia beating when the process of differentiation is complete (Video 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-fig-0004]).\nIt usually takes 21-28 days for HAE cells to be fully differentiated under air-liquid interface conditions (Fig. 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-fig-0002] and 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-fig-0002]). The frequency of ciliated cells will vary between donors.\nThis video cannot be streamed at this time, please download the video instead.[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/93f1e648-acf5-4f69-8ac6-a5da4086f2c8/cpz1453-vid-0001.avi]\nVideo\nCilia beating.

Discard the medium from the basolateral chamber.\n53. Add 500 μl warm PneumaCult-ALI Maintenance medium to the basolateral chamber.\nWarm only the amount of medium to be used in a water bath at 37°C for 10 min.\n54. Incubate the culture at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nRepeat steps 52-54 every 2-3 days.\n55. To remove excess mucus and maintain culture hydration, add 100 μl PBS to the apical surface of the culture, incubate the culture for 10 min at 37°C, then remove the PBS by gentle aspiration.\nMucus production will vary between donors. For donors with minimal mucus build-up or increased sensitivity to washing, incubation times can be shortened and/or performed at room temperature.\nRepeat step 55 once a week.",
    "This protocol is used to infect differentiated HAE-ALI with viruses at the apical (lumenal) surface. Prior to inoculation, the apical surface of differentiated HAE-ALI is washed to remove mucus secretions and facilitate virus access to underlying epithelial cells. Viral inoculum is then added to the culture surface at the desired dose and returned to the CO2 incubator for viral adsorption. The inocula can be kept on, or removed from the culture by washing the apical surface with PBS.\nMaterials\nFully differentiated HAE-ALI cultures (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-prot-0001])\nPhosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without Ca2+ or Mg2+ (Gibco; cat. no.

Select desired temperature conditions for your experiment.\nViral adsorption is typically done at temperatures reflective of either the proximal (32°C-34°C) or distal (37°C) airways. If a temperature other than 37°C is to be used, cultures should be transferred and equilibrated to this temperature 1-2 days prior to viral inoculation.\n2. Optional: Immediately prior to inoculation, remove excessive mucus from the apical surface of HAE-ALI by washing twice with room temperature PBS (without Ca2+ or Mg2+): add 100 μl PBS to the apical chamber, incubate for 15 min at 37°C, and discard the supernatant.\n3. Remove the basolateral medium and replace with 500 μl of warm Pneumacult-ALI Maintenance medium.",
    "Incubate the medium for 10 min in a water bath at 37°C to warm it up.\nBasolateral medium can be exchanged as done during normal feeding, or cultures selected for the experiment can be removed to a separate 24-well plate and then provided with 500 μl Pneumacult-ALI Maintenance medium.\n4. Dilute virus and prepare controls in ≤50 μl final volume.\nTo calculate the dilution ratio of your viral stock, consider 50,000 cells as a rough approximation of the number of cells available for infection at the apical surface. A negative control (mock infection) is critical for setting imaging parameters in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-prot-0003] and should be performed in parallel using cultures inoculated with the same buffer (vehicle) used for virus resuspension (e.g., PBS, cell culture medium, sucrose-containing solution, etc.). “No inoculum” may serve as an additional negative control. Positive controls, such as a related virus known to successfully infect HAE-ALI [e.g., RV-A2 and RV-A16 (Gagliardi et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-bib-0007]); A/California/04/2009 (CA04) (Davis et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-bib-0006]), or SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 (de Vries et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-bib-0023]), if available] may also be included.\nPhase 2: Inoculate HAE-ALI\n5. Add the inoculum (up to 50 μl; prepared in Phase 1, step 4) to the apical surface of the appropriate cultures and return the cultures to the 5% CO2 incubator at the desired temperature.\nThe frequency of infected cells increases as a function of adsorption time. Standard inoculation times range from 1-2 hr (for IAV and SARS-CoV-2) to 4 hr (for RV).\n6. After viral adsorption, aspirate the inoculum and wash the apical surface three times using 100 μl room temperature PBS (no incubation is needed). Alternatively, if the inoculum volume is low (≤10 μl), it may be left on the culture for the duration of the experiment.",
    "7. Return cultures to the 5% CO2 incubator at the desired temperature until experimental time points are reached.\nIf the duration of the experiment will exceed 3 days, HAE-ALI cultures will need to be re-fed.",
    "This protocol is used to detect double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a marker of single-stranded RNA viral replication, as well as viral proteins in HAE-ALI, by indirect immunostaining. Cultures previously inoculated with virus as described in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-prot-0002] are fixed at various experiment time points of interest, and infection is assessed through immunostaining, followed by visualization and image acquisition using a fluorescence or confocal microscope.

    "The fixation and permeabilization of cell membranes are critical steps, as they can influence antibody access to target antigens and binding to epitopes. Because of this, the specific protocol selected depends on the subcellular location of the antigen (plasma membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, etc.). This protocol uses paraformaldehyde during fixation, which enables detection of dsRNA (e.g., during RV infection), IAV-NP, and SARS2-N (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-fig-0003] and 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-fig-0003]). This protocol is also compatible with many other viral and cellular proteins, including acetylated α-tubulin, a marker for motile cilia that can be used to identify mature ciliated cells (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-fig-0003] and 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-fig-0003]). If needed, an alternative fixative reagent can be used; however, this will likely impact the time and temperature at which fixation is performed, as well as other downstream steps. In addition, alternative fixation reagents (e.g., methanol:acetone) may impact the integrity of cellular structures (Fig. 3C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/685cc6c1-c372-4fe2-aba8-1d8c18fdcc4e/cpz1453-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",

Images in (A) and (B) were taken using a Zeiss Axio Observer 3 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with 10× and 20× LWD objectives, Zeiss Axiocam 503 monochrome camera, and AIM-Zen 2007 software, while images in (C) and (D) were obtained after analysis of z-series optical sections (at 1 µm intervals) acquired using LSM710 Zeiss Laser Scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 63×/1.4NA Oil/0.190 nm WD objective, argon laser, and AIM-Zen 2009 software. Z-sections were analyzed using Fiji–ImageJ v.2.1.0/1.53c software (Schindelin et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-bib-0020]).",
    "1. Discard the medium from the basolateral chamber of the culture from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-prot-0002].\n2. Wash once with PBS: add 100 and 500 μl PBS (no Ca2+ or Mg2+) to the apical and basolateral chambers, respectively.\n3. Discard the PBS and, to fix the culture, add 100 μl and 500 μl 4% (v/v) PFA to the apical and basolateral chambers, respectively.\nCAUTION: PFA is a hazardous chemical. Consult the material safety data sheet before use.\n4. Incubate the culture for 15 min at room temperature.\nIn some cases, such as with SARS-CoV-2-inoculated cultures, a longer incubation with the fixative agent may be required to meet institutional biosafety requirements.\n5. Discard the PFA from both sides of the chamber and wash the culture with PBS: add 100 and 500 μl PBS to the apical and basolateral chambers, respectively. Incubate for 3 min at room temperature with constant agitation by placing the cultures on a rocker or belly dancer.\n6. Discard the PBS and repeat step 5 twice, for a total of three washes.\n7. Add 100 and 500 μl quenching solution to the apical and basolateral chambers, respectively, then incubate the plate for 10 min at room temperature.\n8. Discard the quenching solution from both sides of the chamber and wash three times with PBS as in step 5.\n9. Discard the PBS and add 200 and 1000 μl PBS to the apical and basolateral chambers, respectively.\n10. Seal the plate with parafilm and store at 4°C until use.\nPlates can be stored for several months at 4°C, if not dry.\nAfter culture fixation, the following steps can be done on the bench (outside of the certified biological safety cabinet).\nPhase 2: Permeabilize cell membranes",
    "11. Discard the PBS from both sides of the chamber and add 100 and 500 μl permeabilization solution to the apical and basolateral chambers, respectively, then incubate for 15 min at room temperature.\nThe choice of detergent and its concentration in the permeabilization solution depend on the cell type and antigen location. 0.2% Triton X-100 and 0.2% Tween 20 are commonly used in assays to detect viral and cellular markers; digitonin (20 mM; cat. no. 11024-24-1; Sigma-Aldrich) is a better option for detection of transmembrane proteins in organelles, such as phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (Gagliardi et al., 2022[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-bib-0007]).\n12. Discard the permeabilization solution from both sides of the chamber and wash the culture with PBS: add 100 μl and 500 μl PBS to the apical and basolateral chambers, respectively. Incubate for 3 min at room temperature with constant agitation by placing the cultures on a rocker or belly dancer.\n13. Discard the PBS and repeat step 12 twice, for a total of three washes.\n14. Discard the PBS and add 100 and 500 μl PBS to the apical and basolateral chambers, respectively.\n15. Seal the plate with parafilm and store at 4°C until use.\nProlonged storage (more than 1 day) is not recommended.\nPhase 3: Block nonspecific epitopes\n16. Discard the PBS from both sides of the culture and add 100 and 500 μl blocking solution (10% normal serum diluted in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100) to the apical and basolateral chambers, respectively.\n3% BSA reconstituted in PBS with 0.2% Tween 20 may be used as a blocking solution for some indirect immunofluorescence assays and also when you are performing a direct immunofluorescence assay. If you are staining multiple targets, the blocking solution will be a mix of all solutions needed for each individual assay.",
    "17. Incubate the plate for 15-60 min at room temperature.\n18. Discard the blocking solution from the apical chamber only.\nThe blocking solution will be kept in the basolateral chamber through Phase 4 (Immunostaining) while solutions will be added and removed from the apical chamber.\n19. Wash with PBS: add 100 μl PBS to the apical chamber; incubate for 3 min at room temperature and with constant agitation. Discard the PBS and repeat for a total of 3 washes.\n20. Discard the PBS and add 100 μl PBS to the apical chamber. Store the plate at 4°C until use.\nPhase 4: Immunostaining of viral (and cellular) antigens\nThis protocol can be done as a single procedure using fluorophore-conjugated primary antibodies (direct IF assay), or as a two-stage process in which the sample is first incubated with primary antibody followed by fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies (indirect IF staining). In addition, as a multiplex IF assay, several targets can be probed in the same HAE-ALI culture through sequential rounds of immunostaining (Fig. 3D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.453#cpz1453-fig-0003]). In all workflows, nuclei are stained immediately prior to mounting on slides (optional) and visualization.\n21. Discard the PBS from the apical chamber.\n22. Add 100 μl primary antibody diluted in PBS with 1% BSA to the apical chamber.\nThe inclusion of 0.2% Tween 20 in the antibody diluent may improve staining in some cases.\nIf you are performing a direct IF assay, the concentrations of primary antibodies conjugated with fluorophores are usually higher than in indirect IF assays because there is no subsequent signal amplification (e.g., through secondary antibody binding).\n23. Incubate the plate overnight at 4°C, protected from the light.\n24. Discard the primary antibody solution from the apical chamber.",
    "25. Wash with PBS: add 100 μl PBS to the apical chamber; incubate for 3 min at room temperature and with constant agitation. Discard the PBS and repeat this step for a total of three washes.\nIf performing a direct IF assay, skip now to step 30.\n26. Discard the PBS and add 100 μl secondary antibody diluted in PBS with 1% BSA to the apical chamber.\n27. Incubate for 2 hr at room temperature, protected from the light.\n28. Discard the secondary antibody solution.\n29. Wash once with PBS: add 100 μl PBS to the apical chamber; incubate for 3 min at room temperature and with constant agitation.\nIf you wish to probe for additional antigens, repeat steps 21-29 using other sets of antibodies before proceeding to step 30.\n30. Discard the PBS and add 100 μl of nuclei staining solution to the apical chamber.\n31. Incubate for 5 min at room temperature, protected from the light.\n32. Discard the nuclei staining solution.\n33. Wash with PBS: add 100 μl PBS to the apical chamber; incubate for 3 min at room temperature and with constant agitation. Discard the PBS and repeat this step for a total of two washes.\nDepending on epitope availability, you might be able to visualize IF signal at this point in the protocol. To do this, add 100 μl of PBS to the apical chamber. Next, remove the entire Transwell chamber from the 24-well plate and place it on a 35-mm glass-bottom dish (the bottom of the Transwell membrane will be in direct contact with the glass) which has been secured in the slide holder on the fluorescence microscope. Try to focus using the 10× objective lens.\n34. Discard the PBS and remove the Transwell membrane using the #2 T-bar.",
    "Place the Transwell on a flat surface, place the T-bar inside the Transwell and, while pushing down on the T-bar to anchor the culture on the flat surface, pull up on the plastic rim of the Transwell to separate it from the membrane. Collect the membrane using forceps, grabbing the membrane on the edge so as to not damage the epithelium.\n35. Place the Transwell membrane on a glass microscope slide with the epithelium facing up.\n36. Add one drop of antifade mounting medium on top of the membrane.\n37. Cover the membrane with the coverslip and seal with nail polish.\nIt is very important to seal the slide before it dries out. Since the membrane does not always lie perfectly flat, execution of this step is challenging. Therefore, we recommend doing the following: put the coverslip on top of the membrane and, using your finger, push it down while you seal with the nail polish; keep pushing until the nail polish is dry.\n38. Store the slide at 4°C and protect from the light until use.\nFluorophore photostability varies; AlexaFluor dyes are more photostable than fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), for example. Thus, we recommend imaging samples immediately after completion of the staining protocol for best results.\nPhase 5: Visualization and acquisition of IF images\nIt is essential that your IF assay uses dyes that can be detected by the fluorescence microscope available. This information is obtained by checking microscope laser, filter, and detector configurations. In this protocol, we describe steps to acquire images using the Zeiss Axio Observer 3 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with AIM-Zen 2007 software. This protocol can be adapted for use with other microscope models.\n39. Turn on the microscope and open the AIM-Zen 2007 software.",
    "40. Place the positive control slide in the slide holder with the coverslip facing the objective.\nIf there are no positive controls in your assay, insert the slide from a sample that you expect to yield the highest signal.\n41. Select the “observation mode”, turn on the transmitted light, and, using a 10× objective lens, search for the epithelium.\nIt is easiest to find the sample and reach proper focus by starting with the objective at the lowest position and gradually zooming in. Membrane pores are an easy focal point to find for initial orientation, and can also be visualized in multiple fluorescent channels.\n42. Correct the focus by gently moving the focus knob up and down.\n43. Turn off the transmitted light and turn on the reflected light with the proper filter for your fluorophore.\nThe information about each filter is available in the microscope user guide.\n44. Search for detectable fluorescence in the positive control and correct the focus.\n45. If needed, switch to higher observation magnification (e.g., 40×, 63× objective lens) and correct the focus.\nThe correct magnification to visualize the samples depends on the target. The 10× objective lens gives you a general view of the whole epithelium, but you need to use a 63× objective lens if you want to observe targets at the intracellular level.\nNOTE: Make sure immersion oil is used as required for the objective lens in use.\n46. Switch to “camera mode” and begin to optimize the image using AIM-Zen 2007 software.\nEnsure that the correct objective information is selected in the Zen application.\n47. Keep the “auto-exposure” mode selected.\n48. Place your sample on the viewer by moving the XY knob and correcting the focus.",
    "49. Under “image acquisition settings”, set gain for 1× and binning mode for 1 × 1.\n50. Acquire the image and take note of the exposure time.\n51. Turn off the fluorescence light on the sample temporarily.\nThis will prevent photobleaching of your sample while you work on your image.\n52. On the histogram, set the minimum and maximum signal intensity values, trying to remove background and eliminate saturation. Take note of both values.\n53. Switch the slide to the negative control.\n54. Locate the sample on the slide, as above, then turn on the fluorescence light and correct the focus if needed.\n55. Keep the same exposure time, gain, and binning mode previously used for the positive control.\n56. Acquire the image and turn off the fluorescence light on the sample temporarily.\n57. On the histogram, check if the previous values set at step 52 fit the negative control and correct it if not.\n58. If you change the minimum and/or maximum values in step 57, update these values on the image taken from the positive control.\n59. Finally, if the photo quality is still poor (e.g., with saturated signal or high background), acquire a new image starting again with the positive control and adjusting the exposure time.\n60. For multiplex assays, repeat this procedure (steps 44-59) for the next target using the proper filter for each fluorophore. Leave nuclei detection for last.\n61. After setting the parameters for all fluorophores/nuclei, acquire the final images from your experiment by choosing a spot of interest on your sample and taking pictures of each target without changing the X/Y position. You are only allowed to change filters and correct the focus (Z-drive), if needed.\nStart acquiring images from the controls (if there are any) and then from the samples.",
    "62. After image acquisition, add scale bars to the photos as “μm.”\nAdd the same scale bar (value, thickness, and color) and at the same position (e.g., lower right side) in all photos taken per experiment.\n63. Export the photo as a .tiff or .czi file.\nThe .tiff extension with LZW compression is accepted by most journals. However, if you want to work on the photo using another software, you will need the .czi file.\nConfocal microscopy can yield 2D images at higher resolution and sensitivity than fluorescence microscopes as well as images at the 3D level (Z-drive). Individual, hands-on training is typically required. If your experiment requires this type of imaging, we recommend that you contact your microscopy core facility."
