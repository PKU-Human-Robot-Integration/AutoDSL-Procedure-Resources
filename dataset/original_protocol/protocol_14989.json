    "1. Hydrodynamic Delivery of sRANKL MC DNA\nHydrodynamic Delivery via Mouse Tail Vein\n\t\nWeigh the mouse before the tail vein injection. Dilute sRANKL or green fluorescent protein (GFP) MC in Ringer's solution (pre-warm at 37 °C) in a total volume of ~10% of the mouse's body weight.\nWarm up the mouse in a cage for 10 min prior to injection in order to dilate blood vessels and make lateral veins (LVs) visible. Monitor the mouse carefully to avoid dehydration and hyperthermia.\nAs soon as the LVs are dilated and visible, transfer the mouse to the restrainer and insert the plug far enough into the barrel to restrain movement. Monitor the mouse for normal activity such as breathing. Adjust the plug of restrainer if needed.\nDisinfect the injection area 3/4 from the tip of the tail with an alcohol wipe. Use a 27-30 G needle for mouse tail vein injection. Hold the tail firmly with one hand and insert the needle into the tail vein. Apply pressure on the syringe and complete the injection within 5-7 sec.\nRemove the needle from the tail vein and apply pressure with a cotton ball on the injection site to stop bleeding. Monitor the mouse for 15-30 min, then transfer the mouse back to vivarium once the breathing rate is reduced to its normal rate.\nConfirmation of Systemic Mouse sRANKL Expression and Quantification of Mouse Serum TRACP5b Post Gene Transfer\n\t\nWarm up the mouse in a cage for 5-10 min in order to dilate blood vessels and make LVs visible. Monitor the mouse carefully to avoid dehydration and hyperthermia.\nMake a small incision with a blade to the mouse's tail at a site one forth from the tip of the tail.\nCollect approximately 100 μl of blood in serum separation tubes.",
    "Incubate serum separation tubes at room temperature for 30 min.\nCentrifuge samples at 10,000 x g for 5 min and collect serum. Store serum in -80 °C for further analysis.\nPerform sRANKL ELISA and mouse serum TRACP5b assay on serum samples using a commercial available kit.\n2. In vitro Osteoclast Generation from Mouse BMMs\nIsolation and Culturing of BMMs\n\t\nIsolation of the tibia and femur bones: Euthanize the donor mouse with CO2, and disinfect the legs with 70% ethanol. Dissect from the pubic bone to the calcaneus bone, to remove the femur and tibia bones intact.\nRemove the skin and muscle carefully without damaging the bone. Place processed femur and tibia bone in a Petri dish containing phosphate buffered saline (PBS).\nRemoval of bone marrow: Cut off the tip on one side of the femur and tibia bones and flush out the bone marrow into a 50 ml tube using a 1ml syringe with a 25 G needle, loaded with α-MEM containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Osteoclast Culture Medium/OCM).\nProcess bone marrow: Mix and transfer bone marrow suspension to a new 50 ml tube by passing it through a 70 μm nylon cell strainer. Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g and re-suspend in α-MEM containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS (Osteoclast Culture medium/OCM (+)).\nCulture of Macrophages\n\t\nCount cells using a hemocytometer or automatic cell counter.\nPlate 1 x 106 cells per well for a 6-well plate or 3 x 105 cells to glass coverslips (5 mm) or dentine slices placed in 96-well plate and incubate at 37 °C.\nAspirate all media containing non-adherent cells and incubate cells at 37 °C with fresh OCM (+) containing 25 ng/ml mouse M-CSF for 48 hr.",
    "Aspirate all media and incubate cells at 37 °C with fresh OCM (+) media containing 25 ng/ml mouse M-CSF, and 30 ng/ml mouse sRANKL to initiate osteoclastogenesis. Replenish media every 3 days as required.\nGrow cells for approximately 6-8 days to form giant multi-nuclear cells capable of resorbing bone. As soon as multinucleated cells appear, perform TRAP (tartrate resistant acid phosphatase) staining using a commercial available kit, and when fully matured, perform functional assays. Visualize F-actin rings on coverslips using phalloidin stain and image the cells attached to dentine slices by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) as described previously19.\n3. In vitro Osteoclast Generation from Human PBMCs\nIsolation of Human PBMCs\n\t\nAdd 10 ml of pre-warmed Histopaque-1077 into a 50 ml tube.\nEmpty leukocyte filter obtained from blood bank with sterile PBS into a 50 ml tube (1:1 ratio of blood with PBS). Layer the diluted blood over the histopaque solution very slowly, making sure that the blood does not mix with the histopaque.\nCentrifuge samples at 1000 x g for 20 min at 18 °C. Following centrifugation, carefully isolate the white buffy coat layer containing the white blood cells and transfer to a new 50 ml tube.\nDilute cells with PBS and centrifuge again at 650 x g for 5 min to collect the cells.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend cells in OCM (-) media and count cells using cell counter.\nPlating and Culturing PBMCs\n\t\nResuspend the cells in OCM (+) media and plate 8 x 106 cells/ml per well in a 6-well plate or 1 x 106 cells/ml per well in 96-well plate. Plate cells on glass coverslips (5 mm) as required for immunofluorescence imaging as well as on bone slices suitable for bone resorption assays as previously described20.",
    "Change culture media, replenishing the cells with human M-CSF every 2-3 days or as required. Then proceed to differentiation step on day 5 by adding 30 ng/ml of human sRANKL along with 25 ng/ml human M-CSF in OCM (+) media to initiate osteoclastogenesis.\nGrow cells for approximately 14 to 21 days to form giant multi-nuclear cells. As soon as multinucleated cells appear, these cells can then be labeled for TRAP, and when fully matured, functional assays can be performed. F-actin rings can be visualized on coverslips using phalloidin stain. The cell morphology can be examined in cells attached to dentine slices by SEM.\nSubscription Required.
