    "NOTE: All the chemical and biochemical reagents to be used should be of analytical grade and used without further purification. Prepare all solutions using sterile deionized water. Autoclave all glassware prior to sterilization.\nCaution: Please use all appropriate safety practices when performing laboratory activities including the use of engineering controls (fume hood, glovebox) and personal protective equipment (safety glasses, gloves, lab coat, full length pants, closed-toe shoes).\n1. Fabrication and Characterization of Modified Electrode using PLA-AuNPs\nPreparation and characterization of PLA-AuNPs\nQuickly add 10 mL of sodium citrate solution (38.8 mM) to 100 mL of boiling aqueous chloroauric acid solution (1 mM) and cool it down to ambient temperature. Observe the changes in color in the prepared AuNPs solution which starts as yellow, changes to blackish and finally ends as dark ruby red.\nPlace the PLA pellets in a stainless-steel mold for the melting process and preheat them at a temperature of 190 °C for 10 min. Follow with the pressing procedure: put them under a pressure of 2.2 MPa for 1 min as part of the PLA sheet preparation. The PLA sheet will be ready for use after cooling for about 3 h.\nStirring vigorously, dissolve 0.68 mg of the PLA sheets in 5 mL of chloroform at room temperature. Mix the dissolved PLA with 10 mL of the previously prepared AuNPs solution and homogeneously stir it at room temperature. The homogeneous mixtures can then be denoted as PLA-AuNPs and characterized using UV-Vis, XRD, TEM, and FESEM with EDX.\nPreparation and characterization of modified screen-printed carbon electrode\n\tNOTE: The SPCE used in this study comprises a three-electrode system: a counter electrode, a carbon working electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode.",
    "Quickly pipette 25 µL of the homogenous solution of PLA-AuNPs onto the SPCE and then air dry it for 24 h prior to use.\nElectrochemically characterize the modified electrodes, SPCE/PLA-AuNPs, in potassium ferro cyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6]3-/4-) to measure active surface area, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, repeatability, reproducibility, and stability30.\n2. Development of the Electrochemical DNA Biosensor\nProbe preparation\n\tNote: The sequences of the ssDNA probe and complementary DNA were chosen based on information from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database.\n\t\nPurchase synthetic oligonucleotides (20-mer ssDNA probe, 20-mer complementary DNA, 20-mer mismatched DNA, and 21-mer non-complementary DNA) as lyophilized powder from commercial laboratories, based on the following sequences:\n\t\tthiolated ssDNA probe: 5′- / 5ThioMC6-D/CGGATTATGCAGAAGCACTG - 3′\n\t\tcomplementary DNA: 5′ - CAGTGCTTCTGCATAATCCG - 3′\n\t\tone-base mismatched DNA: 5′ - CAGTGCTTCTGC ṪTAATCCG - 3′\n\t\tthree-base mismatched DNA: 5′ - CAGTGCTTCT Ċ ṪṪTAATCCG - 3′\n\t\tnon-complementary DNA: 5′ - CGCACAAGGCTCGACGGCTGA - 3′\nPrepare stock solutions of all oligonucleotides (100 µM) using a sterile TE solution (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5), divided into analytical portions. Keep this at -4 °C and then make the appropriate dilutions just prior to use.\nOptimization of Immobilization and Hybridization\n\tNote: An SPCE modified with PLA-AuNPs, denoted as SPCE/PLA-AuNPs, was used for this study and a drop casting method was used for the DNA immobilization and hybridization.\n\t\nFirst, immobilize 25 µL of thiolated ssDNA probe on the SPCE/PLA-AuNPs and then air dry it for 24 h at room temperature, after which it will be finally denoted as SPCE/PLA-AuNPs/ssDNA. Determine optimization of the immobilization condition by using three factors: the concentration of ssDNA (ranging from 0.2 to 1.4 µM), time (ranging from 30 to 210 min), and temperature (ranging from 25 to 75 °C).",
    "Pipette 25 µL of the complementary DNA on to the surface of SPCE/PLA-AuNPs/ssDNA to carry out the hybridization event after which it can be finally denoted as SPCE/PLA-AuNPs/dsDNA. Determine optimization of the hybridization condition via the two factors of time (ranging from 5 to 30 min) and temperature (ranging from 25 to 75 °C).\nImmerse the immobilized and hybridized electrodes in 20 µM MB for 30 min. Remove the non-specifically adsorbed DNA and excess MB by washing with 0.5 M ABS/20 mM NaCl (pH 4.5) and then rinsing with deionized water. Measure the peak current of MB reduction using DPV technique. Execute the DPV measurement using 0.1 M PBS (pH 7) containing no indicator.\nCharacterization of the fabricated DNA biosensor\nImmerse the SPCE/PLA-AuNPs in 20 µM MB for 30 min, wash with 0.5 M ABS/20 mM NaCl (pH 4.5), and then rinse with deionized water prior to measuring. Follow a similar procedure for all interactions including the probe DNA, complementary DNA, mismatched DNA, and non-complementary DNA samples.\nMeasure the electrochemical reduction.\n\t\tNOTE: We measured DPV using a commercially manufactured Autolab with interface software.\n\t\tThe DPV measurements of the MB electrochemical reduction performed at a potential ranging from -0.5 V to 0.25 V, with a step potential of 0.005 V, modulation amplitude of 0.05 V, and a scan rate of 7.73 mVs-1 in 0.1 M PBS (pH 7), containing no indicator. The selectivity, sensitivity, reproducibility, and heat stability of the fabricated DNA biosensor were further studied. Reported results were presented as mean value measurements in three replicates.\n3. Validation of the Fabricated DNA Biosensor Using Real Samples\nPreparation of bacterial strains\nSelect bacterial samples based on their significant contamination of seafood31,32 .",
    "NOTE: V. parahaemolyticus as reference strains and 8 other bacterial strains (Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritis, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, and Vibrio alginolyticus) of the common foodborne pathogen were employed for the electrochemical DNA biosensor validation in this study.\nConduct a routine sub-culture of bacterial strains on their respective agar every two weeks to maintain their viability, refer Table 1 for culture conditions.\nMaintain long-term preservation of the bacterial strains in their respective growing broths containing 20% (v/v) glycerol at -80 °C as glycerol protects bacteria by preventing the formation of ice crystals that can damage them during the freezing process. Next, inoculate a loop of preserved bacterial cell culture in glycerol stocks into the respective broths. Incubate the broths according to their respective growth time and temperature when needing to revive the bacteria.\nDetermine the quantity of V. parahaemolyticus cells using a spread plate technique33, a standard and a well-known method for enumerating microorganisms derived from a series of dilutions.\n\t\t\nCulture V. parahaemolyticus in Trypticase Soy Broth (TSB + 3% NaCl) at 37 °C in a 140-rpm shaking condition. Then, transfer 1 mL of the bacteria cell culture into 9 mL of TSB + 3% NaCl to obtain a 10-1 dilution factor.\nRepeat this step nine times to get a full series of up to 10-10 dilution factor. Next, spread 0.1 mL of each dilution factor (starting from 10-1 to 10-10) on a Vibrio's selective agar plate for colony counting, respectively. Incubate the plates incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.",
    "Use a colony counter to count individual colonies and then back-calculate (count the CFU/pipetted amount x dilution factor) to get a colony-forming unit per milliliter density (CFU mL-1). Derive the concentration of the colony forming units (CFUs) in the bacteria cell suspensions from the calibration plot of CFU mL-1 against absorbance.\nPreparation of the PCR assay\nExtract genomic DNA following a modified boiled lysis procedure34. First, streak an individual bacterial strain on agar media and inoculate it in broth media, followed by incubating it at its relative growth condition, a 140 rpm shaking condition.\nPipette a 1 mL culture of broth into a micro centrifuge tube. Centrifuge this at 4830 x g and 4 °C for 1 min to obtain pellets. Use about 500 µL of sterile TE buffer for re-suspension with the pellet. Hold the resulting suspension for 10 min at 98 ± 2 °C in a heating block and immediately chill it at -18 °C for 10 min to lyse the cells and release the DNA.\nCentrifuge the genomic DNA at 4830 x g and 4 °C for 3 min to obtain a clear suspension and keep the supernatant at -20 °C for further use. Use a biophotometer measurement with UV absorption at a wavelength of 260 nm (as nucleic acids absorbing wavelength of light) and also at a wavelength of 280 nm (as the proteins absorbing wavelength of light) to determine the concentration and purity of the extracted genomic DNA and then identify all strains using standard biochemical assays35 and verifying them by 16S rRNA gene sequencing36. Finally, denature the genomic DNA at 92 °C for 2 min and cool it rapidly in ice water prior to application to the biosensor.",
    "Further confirm the presence V. parahaemolyticus using PCR to target the toxR gene. Perform this procedure in a thermocycler using a primer pair (5'-GTCTTCTGACGCAATCGTTG-3' and 5'-ATACGAGTGGTTGCTGTCATG-3'). Optimize the PCR amplification in a total reaction volume of 25 µL consisting of sterile water (15.5 µL), buffer (5 µL), primer (1 µL, 10 µM), dNTP mix (1 µL), DNA template (2 µL), and Taq DNA polymerase (0.2 µL, 10x).\nMix the components well and arrange the PCR amplification of the target sequence in a thermocycler programmed for 30 cycles of amplification. In our study, each cycle consisted of three-step reactions i.e., initial denaturation (94 °C, 3 min) followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 1 min), annealing (63 °C, 1.5 min) and extension (72 °C, 1.5 min), followed by final extension (72 °C, 7 min).\nDetermine the amplified products and their sizes via electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gel. Capture the gel images with a commercially produced gel-documentation system.\nPreparation of cockle samples\nObtain fresh samples.\n\t\tNOTE: Our fresh cockles (Anadara granosa) were obtained from the wet market in Serdang, Selangor, and quickly brought to the laboratory in an ice cooler box for analysis. Divide the samples into 2 groups, namely the treated and untreated group, assuming that the cockles were harvested uniformly from the start of the harvest until placing them into cold storage.\nPre-treat cockles in the treated group by storing them at -20 °C for 24 h, followed by exposure to UV light at 20 °C for 4 h prior to DNA extraction.",
    "NOTE: The freezing temperature and UV exposure used for the controlled group kills or at least limits the naturally accumulating V. parahaemolyticus in the cockles. Do not apply a higher pasteurization regime of 70 °C as the aim of the controlled condition in this study is to mimic the actual situation of the fresh cockles. Meanwhile, analyze samples directly from the untreated group without any pre-treatment as soon as they arrive in the laboratory.\nSubculture a strain of V. parahaemolyticus ATCC 17802 in TSB (3% NaCl). Determine the level of viable cells in the inoculum via plating of appropriate dilutions of TSB (3% NaCl) on CA in order to obtain an inoculum of 104 CFU mL-1 of V. parahaemolyticus. Wash each cockle in distilled water and scrub it free of dirt before using sterile forceps in a laminar flow cabinet to remove the tissues from the shell.\nHomogenize about 10 g of cockle tissue samples with a homogenizer in 90 mL of sterile TSB (3% NaCl) for 60 s. Add a known amount of V. parahaemolyticus to 9 mL of the homogenized sample broth for the spiked samples. Use the unspiked samples as a negative control. Estimate the cell counts of V. parahaemolyticus spiked on to the cockle samples by plating 0.1 mL of the samples on CA, and subsequently, pipetting 1 mL of samples into a microcentrifuge tube for DNA sample extraction, to be used in the biosensor and PCR assay.",
    "Extract the genomic DNA of the V. parahaemolyticus from the spiked and unspiked samples following a modified boiled lysis procedure36. Finally, determine the DNA concentration and purity using a bio photometer measurement with UV absorption at a wavelength of 260 nm (as nucleic acids absorbing wavelength of light) and also at a wavelength of 280 nm (as the proteins absorbing wavelength of light).\nSubscription Required.
