    "Saccharomyces cerevisiaeS. cerevisiae cells are unable to incorporate BrdU into DNA because they lack the nucleotide salvage pathway that enables uptake of extracellular thymidine or its analogs. To circumvent this problem, strains for molecular combing have been engineered to ectopically express the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) under the control of the constitutive GPD promoter, inserted at the URA3 locus on chromosome V (strain PP872; genetic background: W303; genotype: MATa, ade2-1, trp1-1, can1-100, leu2-3,112, his3-11,15, ura3, GAL, psi+, RAD5, ura3::URA3-GPD-TK7) (Lengronne et al., 2001; Viggiani and Aparicio, 2006). Cells bearing one integrated copy of the HSV-TK + hENT1 vector (human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1) (Viggiani and Aparicio, 2006) show comparable levels of BrdU incorporation to cells with seven copies of HSV-TK alone (Bianco et al., 2012).Note: DNA molecular combing procedure doesn’t differ for fission yeast excepted for growth and labelling conditions (Kaykov et al., 2016).BrdU labeling of synchronized HU-arrested cells and preparation of DNA genomic plugsGrow cells overnight at 25 °C to a density of 5 x 106 cells/ml in 100 ml of YPAD.Add α-factor (2 μg/ml) at T0 in order to synchronized cells in G1. A second (4 μg/ml) and a third dose (2 μg/ml) of α-factor are added part way at respectively T1h and T2h to ensure that cells do not escape the G1 arrest. Note: The length of G1 synchronisation varies from 2.5 to 3 h depending on the doubling time of yeast strains. Make sure that cells are in G1 (unbudded cells) before the release into S phase (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170601/20170601230410_1278.jpgFigure 1. Yeast cell morphology in G1 and early S phase. A. G1 synchronised yeast cells; B. Yeast cells in S phase + HU after release from G1 for 90 min.",
    "Add (i) BrdU to a final concentration of 400 μg/ml (or 40 μg/ml if cells express the nucleotide transporter hENT1), and (ii) Hydroxyurea (HU, 200 mM) at least 15 min before releasing cells into S phase.Note: Elongation from early-firing origins is inhibited with the addition of HU in order to restrict the length of newly replicated regions to 10 kb.Release cells from α-factor arrest into S phase by addition of 50 μg/ml Pronase (degrades alpha factor peptide in medium). Adjust the pH of the medium to 7.0 with potassium phosphate buffer.After 90 min, collect cells by centrifugation at 4 °C; 1,096 x g in a 50 ml tube containing cold 0.1% NaN3 (sodium azide). Note: Sodium azide inhibits cytochrome oxidase (last enzyme in the respiratory electron transport chain of mitochondria or bacteria) by binding irreversibly to the heme cofactor and stops all cell metabolism, including DNA replication.Resuspend the cells in one volume of cold TE50, 0.1% NaN3 and keep them on ice. Check cells under a microscope (Nikon YS100). More than 90% of the cells should display small buds, which are indicative of entry into S phase (Figure 1).Preparation of genomic DNA plugsGenomic DNA is prepared in low melting point (LMP) agarose plugs to prevent mechanical shearing. Freshly prepare molten 2% LMP agarose in bi-distilled water and Zymolyase buffer. Keep at 42 °C in thermomixer until use.Determine cell concentration with a cell counter.Wash cells once with NZ buffer. Resuspend cells in prewarmed Zymolyase buffer (42 °C) to a final concentration of 4 x 108 cells/ml and carefully mixed with an equal volume of molten 2% LMP agarose (42 °C). Note: The Zymolyase will digest the cell wall.",
    "Transfer the cellular suspension into a plug mold sealed with tape to generate 90 μl plugs (Figure 2) containing 2 x 107 cells or approximately 350 ng of genomic DNA per plug at room temperature. Note: Prepare at least 4 plugs per sample.Cover molds with a plastic film (Figure 2) and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170601/20170601232113_6713.jpgFigure 2. Pictures of a plug mold. A and B. Top and bottom views; C. Plug mold sealed with a tape and covered with a saran plastic film.Place agarose plugs at 4 °C for 10 min to let the agarose solidify. Transfer plugs into 14 ml round-bottom polypropylene tubes using a Pasteur pipette rubber bulb and incubate them at 37 °C in Proteinase K buffer (2 ml for 4 plugs) for 1 h under gentle agitation. Transfer plugs into fresh Proteinase K buffer and incubate for 24 h at 37 °C. Repeat once for an additional 24 h. Note: Incubation with PK buffer is critical to degrade proteins that perturb DNA fiber stretching.Wash plugs for two days in TE50, 100 mM NaCl on a roller mixer at room temperature. Change the buffer from time to time.Keep plugs at 4 °C in TE50 buffer until use (stable for months). Note that DNA plugs are translucent and fragile.Human cells Note: This protocol is available for any kind of mammalian cells.BrdU labelling and preparation of DNA genomic plugsUnlike budding yeast, human cells cannot be easily synchronized and experiments are usually performed with asynchronous cultures. Under these conditions, it is critical to use a combination of two modified nucleotides (IdU and CldU) to determine the polarity of replication forks and the position of initiation sites (Figure 3). (Conti et al., 2007)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170601/20170601232436_7834.jpgFigure 3. Schematic patterns obtained by DNA combing after IdU/CldU pulses in asynchronous mammalian cells.",
    "To determine fork velocity, green tracks adjacent to red tracks are measured in B, C, E. Stalled forks are represented in A and E and interorigin distances (IOD) in B and D. ORI: origin of replication. Arrows indicate fork direction. F. Schematic pattern obtained by DNA combing after BrdU pulse in synchronized budding yeast cells. Grow cells to a confluence of about 70% in 6-well plates. At the time of the experiment each well need to contain a minimum of 1 x 105 cells.Label cells by adding IdU (20 μM final) directly in 2 ml medium.Incubate cells at 37 °C for at least 10 min.Replace medium with 2 ml of prewarmed medium containing 200 μM CldU. Incubate cells at 37 °C for 20 min.Note: To avoid thermal shock and other perturbations, add nucleotides directly to growth medium (first pulse). Use prewarmed medium and a much higher concentration for the second pulse to avoid washes.The range of IdU/CldU staining time should be adjusted for each cell line from 10 to 30 min depending on S phase duration. Rinse cells with PBS and trypsinize cells as usual, adjust trypsinization time to cell type. For instance, incubate cells for 3-5 min in 0.05% trypsin, 1 mM EDTA.Collect cells, place them on ice and spin for 5 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C. Keep the cells on ice until use (to stop DNA synthesis).Preparation of genomic DNA plugsResuspend cells in 5 ml cold PBS, spin for 5 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C and resuspend in 1 ml cold PBS. Count cells and resuspend at 8 x 105 to 2 x 106 cells/ml in cold PBS, depending on cell size.Prepare a solution of 2% LMP agarose in PBS and keep at 42 °C until use.",
    "Add an equal volume of 2% LMP agarose to cells. To prepare 4 plugs, add 200 μl of 2% LMP agarose solution to 200 μl of prewarmed cells solution.Mix very gently with a P1000 pipetman (optional: cut tip).Transfer 90 μl per plug into a plug mold sealed with tape.Let plugs solidify for 25 min at room temperature and for 10 min at 4 °C.Use a Pasteur pipette rubber bulb to eject plugs into 14 ml round-bottom tubes containing 0.5 ml of Proteinase K buffer per plug. Mix gently on roller mixer and change the PK buffer after 1 h.Incubate for 48 h at 37 °C. Change the PK solution twice more during this incubation. Mix gently on a roller mixer.Note: Incubation with PK buffer is critical to degrade proteins that perturb DNA fiber stretching. Gently remove the solution by blocking the agarose plug with a cell scraper. Plugs are transparent and difficult to manipulate after PK treatment.Wash plugs several times for two days in TE50, 100 mM NaCl on the roller mixer at room temperature. Store at 4 °C in TE50 until use. Genomic DNA is stable for months at 4 °C in TE50 buffer. Procedures common to yeast and human cellsMelting of agarose plugs containing genomic DNATransfer a plug in a 12 ml round-bottom tube. Plugs are washed 3 times for 1 h in 1x TE pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl. After removing of the last wash, add 100 μl 1x TE and 1.5 μl YOYO-1 to stain genomic DNA. Keep in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Note: YOYO staining is lost after DNA denaturation but is used to check combing before detection.Wash 4 times for 5 min with 10 ml 1x TE with gentle shaking.",
    "Wash once for 5 min with 2 ml of 50 mM MES pH 6, 100 mM NaCl.Replace with 3 ml of 50 mM MES pH 6, 100 mM NaCl.Note: Increase the volume of MES if fiber density is too high after combing. The pH of MES is critical to obtain a correct density and stretching of DNA fibers.Incubate for 15-30 min for human cells and 45 min for yeast cells at 67 °C in a heating block. Note: From now on, manipulate samples with extreme care to avoid DNA shearing.Check the DNA solution. If the shape of the plug is still visible, put it back at 67 °C until complete melting.Let the solution cool down to 42 °C before adding β-agarase (3 U per plug).Incubate overnight at 42 °C.Visually inspect the DNA solution. If you still see agarose aggregates; add β-agarase (1 U per plug) for 2 more hours.Incubate at 65 °C for 10 min and store at room temperature in dim light until use.DNA combingDNA combing is performed on silanized coverslips as described (Bensimon et al., 1994; Lengronne et al., 2001; Michalet et al., 1997). The quality of silanized coverslips is critical for the subsequent analysis of replication profiles. The whole procedure using the genomic vision device can be visualized on this video: https://youtu.be/LjjpYby3YIk[href=https://youtu.be/LjjpYby3YIk]. Carefully pour the DNA solution into a 2 ml Teflon reservoir. Save the rest for further use. Note: Genomics Vision sells disposable 2 ml plastic reservoirs to melt plug directly in the reservoir and avoid manipulation of the DNA solution.Insert a silanized coverslip into the DNA solution and incubate for 5 min at room temperature. Using a DNA combing device, remove carefully the coverslip from the reservoir at a constant speed of 300 μm/sec.",
    "Repeat with another coverslip as many times as needed (2 slides per sample is usually sufficient). At this stage, DNA is stretched on both sides of the coverslip. Visualize DNA fibers on one side under the microscope (Nikon YS100) using a 40x objective and a FITC filter block. To this aim, fix with tape the coverslip to a metal coverslip holder, put a drop of immersion oil directly on the coverslip to visualize DNA fibers. Place the coverslip on a sheet of Whatman paper to soak up oil and bake for 2 h at 60 °C to crosslink DNA to coverslips. Stick the oiled side of coverslips on glass slides with cyanoacrylate glue. Label slides with a diamond tip engraving pen and store at -20 °C until use.Note: If needed, some steps presented in A2/B2 and C1/C2 sections can be modified to increase the length of stretched DNA molecules as described (Kaykov et al., 2016). If the density of fibers is too low, the DNA solution can be kept for a few days at 4 °C to increase DNA resuspension in MES buffer before combing. ImmunodetectionSpecific combinations of primary and secondary antibodies are used to detect BrdU or CldU/IdU and DNA fibers simultaneously.Dehydrate slides for 5 min in successive baths of 70%, 90% and 100% ethanol in Coplin jar. Let air dry the slides.Incubate in Coplin jar for 25 min in freshly prepared 1 N NaOH to denature the DNA duplex. Note: Prolonged incubation in NaOH degrades the silane layer and should be avoided.Wash extensively with PBS pH 7.4 to neutralize NaOH (5 washes of 1 min each).Saturate slides for 15 min in PBS/T containing 1% BSA.Add 20 μl of PBS/T containing primary antibodies and cover with a coverslip. Incubate for 45 min at 37 °C in a humid chamber.",
    "Wash 5 min x 2 times with PBS/T in Coplin jar. Note: Dip slide in a Coplin jar containing PBS/T in order to remove the upper coverslip without damaging the DNA fibers.Detect with secondary antibodies (30 min at 37 °C in a humid chamber).Wash 5 min x 3 times with PBS/T in Coplin Jar.Air dry slides and mount by adding 5 μl Prolong Gold Antifade reagent on coverslip covered with a second coverslip. Let mounting reagent polymerize for at least 2 h at room temperature (preferably overnight and protect from light) before proceeding with microscopy. Mounted coverslips are stable for months at -20 °C.Image acquisition and data analysisImage acquisition is performed with a 40x objective on a motorized microscope equipped with a camera and controlled with Zeiss ZEN Pro 2 software or equivalent (Figure 4). The conversion factor (CF) from pixel to bp (CF = P/M x S) depends on the pixel size of the CCD camera (P in μm), on the magnification of the objective (M) and on the stretching of DNA fibers (S, 2 kb/µm for DNA combing). DNA molecules of known length, such as concatemers of bacteriophage lambda DNA, can be used as size standards. BrdU tracks and DNA fibers can be measured manually with MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) or open source software such as ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/[href=http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/]). Data are transferred to an Excel spreadsheet for analysis. DNA fiber identification and length measurements can be automated with software like IDeFIx, developed by the DNA combing facility of Montpellier (IGMM, CNRS) or software developed by Genomic Vision. Critical issues regarding potential biases and limitations of DNA fiber analysis have been extensively discussed elsewhere (Techer et al., 2013; Tuduri et al., 2010).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170601/20170601234416_8544.jpgFigure 4. Representative examples of replication patterns observed by DNA combing. A and B.",
    "Yeast cells were released from G1 in the presence of 200 mM HU and labeled with BrdU for 90 min. DNA fibers were purified and stretched by DNA combing. BrdU and ssDNA were detected as indicated. A representative field of view is shown. Bar is 50 kb. C and D. Human cells were labeled for 15 min with IdU and 60 min with CldU. The combination of antibodies used to detect IdU, CldU and ssDNA is indicated. A representative field of view is shown. Bar is 50 kb. Image acquisition is performed with a motorized Leica DM6000B microscope equipped with a CoolSNAP HQ CCD camera (6.45 µm/pixel) and a 40x oil immersion objective. With this setup and a DNA stretching of 2 kb/µm, one pixel corresponds to (6.45/40) x 2 = 323 bp."
