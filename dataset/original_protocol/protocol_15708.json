    "All the experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Juntendo University (Approval No. 2021245, 2021246) and performed in accordance with Fundamental Guidelines for Proper Conduct of Animal Experiments by the Science Council of Japan (2006). Here, male C57BL/6J mice injected with AAV vector carrying enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene and parvalbumin (PV)/myristoylation-EGFP-low-density lipoprotein receptor C-terminal bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenic mice (PV-FGL mice)9 were used. PV-FGL mice were maintained in C57BL/6J background. No sex-based differences were found with regard to this study.\n1. Tissue preparation\nPerfusion fixation\n\tNOTE: Perform steps 1.1.1 through 1.1.3 in a fume hood to limit the exposure to paraformaldehyde (PFA).\n\t\nAnesthetize adult male mice (8–16 weeks old) by an intraperitoneal injection of overdose of sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg). Confirm adequacy of anesthesia by the absence of toe-pinch withdrawal and eye-blink reflexes.\nOpen the thoracic cavity and cut the right atrial appendage with surgical scissors. Perfuse the mice with 20 mL of ice-cold phosphate buffer saline (PBS) using a 23 G needle attached to a 20 mL syringe, followed by perfusion of 20 mL of ice-cold 4% PFA in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB) using another 20 mL syringe.\n\t\tCAUTION: PFA is toxic and teratogenic. Avoid inhalation or contact with skin, eyes, and mucous membrane.\nRemove brain tissues from the skull with tweezers. Transfer the brain tissues to a 15 mL tube containing 4% PFA in 0.1 M PB, protect the samples from light, and gently rock overnight at 4 °C on a shaker at 50–100 rpm.\nNOTE: The harvested brain tissues can be stored for several weeks in 0.02% sodium azide (NaN3) in PBS at 4 °C.\n\t\tCAUTION: NaN3 is toxic. Avoid inhalation or contact with skin, eyes, and mucous membrane. Handle it inside a fume hood.\nBrain slice preparation",
    "Prepare 4% agar in PBS by adding 2 g of agar to 50 mL of PBS. Microwave the mixture until the agar is fully dissolved. Let the solution cool to 40-45 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The viscous property provided by agaropectin, a major component of agar, improves ease of cutting of tissue slices.\nAdd 10 mL of the agar solution to a 6-well culture plate. Submerge the brain tissue in the agar solution using forceps. Let the agar solidify on ice.\nRemove the embedded brain tissue from the well and trim the agar with a razor blade. Secure the agar block onto the bottom of the vibratome bath with superglue and pour 0.1 M PB in the buffer tray.\nClean another razor blade using a lint-free tissue paper soaked in ethanol and attach the blade to the blade holder of the vibrating tissue slicer.\nSet the sectioning speed to 0.14 mm/s with 1.4 mm amplitude and the frequency to 75–77 Hz. Cut the brain tissue into 1-mm-thick slices and collect the slices in a 6-well cell culture plate containing PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: The brain slices can be stored for several weeks in 0.02% NaN3 in PBS at 4 °C.\n2. Tissue clarification\nNOTE: The compositions of ScaleS solutions used are listed in Table 1. Samples should be protected from light by covering with a foil. The clearing steps is shown in Figure 1A.\nAdd 8 mL of ScaleS0 solution to one well of a 6-well cell culture plate and add 8 mL of ScaleS4 solution to another well of the plate and pre-warm to 37 °C in an incubator.\nTransfer the brain slices to the pre-warmed ScaleS0 solution with a spatula and incubate for 2 h at 37 °C in a shaking incubator at 90 rpm.",
    "Transfer the permeabilized brain slices in 8 mL of PBS(–) in a 6-well cell culture plate with a spatula and wash for 15 min by keeping in an orbital shaker at 40–60 rpm. Repeat this twice.\nTransfer the brain slices in the pre-warmed 8 mL of ScaleS4 solution with a spatula and clear them by incubating in a shaking incubator at 90 rpm for 8–12 h at 37 °C. A cleared brain slices can be seen in Figure 1.\n3. Brain slice mounting\nNOTE: A customizable imaging chamber is used for reliable mounting of cleared brain slices (Figure 2)6. The chamber consists of the chamber frame and bottom coverslip. The microscope stage adaptors are also designed to mount the imaging chamber on microscope stages directly (Figure 2A,B). The chamber frame and microscope stage adaptors can be 3D-printed using in-house or outsourced 3D-printing services. 3D computer-aided design (CAD) data of the imaging chamber are provided in Furuta et al. 20226.\nFor chamber preparation, attach the chamber frame to a coverslip using a pressure-sensitive adhesive.\nPrepare 1.5% agarose in ScaleS4D25(0) solution (ScaleS4 gel) by adding 1.5 g of agarose to 100 mL of the solution in a bottle. Mix the solution well by stirring and microwave the solution until the agarose is fully dissolved. Once done, allow the solution to cool to 37 °C.\nMount the cleared brain slice onto the bottom coverslip of the imaging chamber with a spatula. Wipe away the excess solution from the cleared slice using a clean lint-free tissue paper.\nAdd the ScaleS4 gel on the brain slice using a micropipette to fill the imaging chamber. Place another coverslip on top with forceps and place a piece of lint-free tissue paper and a glass slide on the coverslip in this order.",
    "Transfer the imaging chamber to a refrigerator at 4 °C. Place metal weights on the glass slide and leave them for 30 min.\nRemove the metal weights, glass slide, lint-free tissue paper, and coverslip from the imaging chamber, and wipe the excess gel away (Figure 2A,B).\nPlace the imaging chamber in a 60 mm glass Petri dish and attach the rim of the imaging chamber to the dish with a putty-like pressure sensitive adhesive. Attach the chamber at multiple points to the Petri dish.\nPour ScaleS4 solution in the dish and shake gently for 1 h at 20-25 °C on an orbital shaker at 40-60 rpm. Substitute with fresh solution and remove air bubbles on the gel surface by gently scraping the surface using a 200 µL pipette tip. Mount the immersed imaging chamber on a microscope stage (Figure 2C).\n4. CLSM imaging\nAcquire images using a CLSM equipped with a multi-immersion objective lens of a long working distance (WD) (16x/0.60 numerical aperture [NA], WD = 2.5 mm).\n\tNOTE: High NA objective lenses can provide high diffraction-limited resolution.\nTurn on all the relevant imaging equipment (workstation, microscope, scanner, lasers, and mercury lamp) and launch a CLSM imaging software.\nSet the correction collar of the multi-immersion objective lens to 1.47. ScaleS4 solution has a refractive index (RI) of around 1.475,7. RI mismatch-induced aberrations can disturb the image formation (Figure 3).\nImmerse the objective lens in the solution, and let it approach the slice slowly. Remove any air bubbles trapped on the tip of the objective lens. Find regions of interest (ROIs) in the cleared tissues using epifluorescence.\nSet image acquisition parameters by testing appropriate settings.\n\t\nDetermine the bit depth for image acquisition. The data size of the image increases with the bit depth.",
    "Set the detection wavelength. Adjust the appropriate gate for the detector according to the emission spectrum. Ensure that the detection wavelength does not cover any laser lines.\nSet the xy resolution. Larger formats provide better xy resolutions, but it takes longer time to collect the images.\nSet the scan speed. A slower scan speed provides a high signal-to-noise ratio. However, it also increases the pixel dwell time and the risk of photobleaching. Choose accordingly.\nAdjust the pinhole size. The pinhole size controls optical section thickness. A smaller pinhole size creates a thinner optical section, and thus better z resolution, but reduces fluorescence signal. Making the pinhole size larger provides a thicker optical section with stronger fluorescence signal.\nSet the laser power, the detector/amplifier gain, and offset. Gradually increase the laser power and detector/amplifier gain until a suitable image is obtained. A high laser power carries the risk of photobleaching. Adjust the offset (contrast) appropriately to obtain a high signal-to-noise ratio.\nDetermine the tilling area needed based on the size of ROI. Ensure that the entire length and width of the ROI is captured.\nNavigate the cleared tissues in all planes, and set the start and end points of the stack. Set the z-step size according to the desired z-resolution.\nCollect images when satisfied with the image acquisition settings, and record captured images. Process the images using an image analysis software.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
