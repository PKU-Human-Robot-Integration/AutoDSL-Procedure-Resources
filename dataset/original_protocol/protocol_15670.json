  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were approved by Northwestern University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUC) and were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. The protocols for dissection and preparation of brainstem tissue are in adherence with previous protocols5,13.\n1. Egg handling\nPurchase fertilized eggs (Gallus gallus domesticus) from an IACUC-approved local animal supplier.\nStore the eggs immediately upon arrival in a refrigerator at 14 °C and incubate within 5 days.\n\tNOTE: Embryo viability decreases considerably after 1 week.\nSterilize the eggs with 70% ethanol before incubation at 38 ± 1 °C and ~50% humidity.\n2. Artificial cerebral-spinal fluid (ACSF) composition and preparation\nMix the following chemicals in 1 L of 18.2 MΩcm dH2O to create a 10x ACSF stock solution: NaCl (sodium chloride) 130 mM, NaHCO3 (sodium bicarbonate) 26 mM, KCl (potassium chloride) 2.5 mM, NaH2PO4 (sodium dihydrogen phosphate) 1.25 mM, dextrose (D-(+)-glucose) 10 mM. Keep the stock solution in the refrigerator.\nPrepare MgCl2 (magnesium chloride) 1 M and CaCl2 (calcium chloride) 1 M solutions separately in 18.2 MΩcm dH2O and store in the refrigerator.\nImmediately before use, dilute 10x ACSF to 1x and bubble continuously with 95% O2/5% CO2 for 15-20 min and add MgCl2 and CaCl2. To prepare ACSF and dACSF (dissecting ACSF), adjust to a final concentration of Mg2+ 1 mM, Ca2+ 3 mM and Mg2+ 3 mM, Ca2+ 1 mM, respectively.\nSet the bubbling rate for the ACSF so that the pH is 7.2-7.4 with an osmolality between 300 and 310 mOsm/L.\n\t​NOTE: Having the ACSF placed in an ice bath while bubbling is beneficial for maintaining a low solution temperature, which will support tissue structural integrity while dissecting.\n3. Agarose (5%) block preparation",
    "Mix 5 g of agarose in 100 mL of dACSF. Use a 100 °C water bath or microwave for 2-3 min, stirring every 30 s to prevent lumps until the agarose dissolves completely and starts bubbling.\nPour the melted agarose in an empty Petri dish up to 5 mm thickness and keep at room temperature to set. After setting, seal the Petri dish using parafilm and store at 4 °C.\nCut the agarose into cubical blocks with a sharp blade and use them at the time of dissection.\n4. Dissection protocol and isolating auditory brainstem\nClean the dissection area using 70% ethyl alcohol solution spray.\nGlue the supporting or angled agarose block onto the vibratome tray.\nChoose eggs of the desired age (E20 and E21 in the present protocol). Handle and incubate the eggs following the protocols listed above as in step 1.\nLocate the air-filled space by placing the egg under a bright light (candling) and looking for this space on the larger or rounder side of the egg.\nAcclimate the eggs to room temperature, crack the shell over the air-filled space, and expose the membrane sac.\nMake a gentle incision in the sac to expose the beak.\nWith a scalpel, gently pull the neck and head out of the egg.\nQuicky decapitate the head using sharp scissors.\nAfter decapitation, clean the head with ice-chilled dACSF to remove excess blood from the dissection pad.\nHold the head steady in ice-chilled dACSF and make a rostro-caudal incision. Start the incision behind and between the eyes and follow the length of the harvested neck.\n\tNOTE: Younger embryos may require less pressure while making the incision.\nSeparate the skin to expose the skull.\nCut the skull behind the eye in a midline to lateral direction. Do this for both hemispheres.",
    "NOTE: This step helps separate the rostral portion of the skull from the attached brain while keeping the brain tissue intact5.\nSlice the rostral portion of the skull. Place the blade behind the eyes and make a quick cut.\n\tNOTE: Effort may be required to cut the attached skull cleanly.\nImmerse the head in a dish of cold dACSF.\nUtilizing a small pair of scissors, make midline to lateral incisions in the caudal region of the skull to try and separate the brain from the skull without causing tissue damage.\nGently expose the brainstem and cerebellum. Retract the dorsal area of the entire skull, remove the brainstem carefully, and expose it with the help of a fine paintbrush with mild sledding. Use curved forceps to clean the brainstem from connecting tissue and blood vessels. Pay extra attention to the 8th cranial nerve area and be sure to leave a short length of intact nerve fibers on both sides.\nSeparate the brainstem from the cerebellum by cutting the peduncles and removing the blood vessels carefully. Trim the brainstem of additional blood vessels.\n\tNOTE: Ensure that the whole procedure is performed in ice-chilled dACSF continuously bubbled with carboxygen (95% O2/5% CO2).\n5. Vibratome slicing\nNOTE: In the following steps, the back of the tissue must be supported with a cubical piece of agarose.\nPlace the vibratome blade along the horizontal axis and glue the brainstem on a slicing tray. Glue the rostral side, keeping the rostral-caudal axis vertical for coronal slices.\n\t\nKeep the lateral-medial axis vertical for sagittal slices.\nGlue the ventral side, keeping the dorsal-ventral axis vertical for horizontal slices.",
    "To achieve the acute angular sagittal-horizontal plane, glue the brainstem's ventral side, keeping the ventral-dorsal axis vertical on the agarose block's hypotenuse surface, which is cut at a 45° angle. Glue the opposite surface of the agarose block facing the slicing tray and keep the rostral-caudal axis parallel to the blade edge.\n6. Handling fragile or large pieces of brainstem tissue\nIn an alternative approach to step 5, immerse the isolated brainstem in 4% low melting point (LMP) agarose at ~40 °C in a 35 mm x 10 mm Petri dish.\n\t\nAfter pouring agarose on the immersed brainstem, place the Petri dish on ice to solidify. Cut the cubical agarose block with embedded brainstem using a sharp razor blade.\nGlue the LMP agarose block on its rostral side, keeping the brainstem's rostral-caudal axis vertical.\n\t\nTake coronal slices until the NM region can be visualized.\nRemove the agarose block from the glue with a sharp blade. To spot the nuclei, gently place 0.5 µL of dye (toluidine blue or orange G) on the NM with a fine needle.\nRemount this block on the slicing tray for sagittal or horizontal slices and identify the nuclei with respect to the stained region.\nFor the best performance, set the vibratome slicing speed at 4 - 5 (~30 ± 4 mm/min), vibrating frequency at 85-87 Hz, and slicing amplitude at 4-6 (~1 ± 0.2 mm).\nAfter brainstem sectioning, place the 200-300 µm sequentially collected slices in a commercially available slice chamber to equilibrate for 1 h at room temperature in ACSF, continuously bubbled with a mixture of 95% O2/5% CO2 (pH 7.2-7.4, osmolarity 300-310 mOsm/L). In these conditions, slices remain viable up to 5-6 h.\n7. Electrophysiology: patch clamp procedure",
    "Transfer a brainstem slice to the recording chamber with continuous perfusion of carboxygenated ACSF ~1.5 ± 0.5 mL/min.\nPull patch pipettes with a micropipette puller of tip diameter 1-2 µm and resistance in the range of 3-6 MΩ.\n\t\nFill pipettes with a K-Gluconate-based internal solution (for current-clamp recording).\nTo test the neuronal properties across the different tonotopic regions within a slice, locate neurons at either end of the slice plane and approach with the recording electrode.\nMaintain positive air pressure at the pipette tip while approaching a neuron.\nMove towards the soma until an indentation is visualized on the neuron. Perform the next two steps quickly.\nMake a gigaohm (1 GΩ) seal by releasing positive air pressure.\nKeep the amplifier setting in voltage-clamp mode and correct the pipette offset as zero pA. Run a seal test (10 mV test pulse at 100 Hz). Apply negative air-pressure to rupture a small patch of the neuronal membrane.\nTo test the active intrinsic properties of auditory neurons, apply hyperpolarizing and depolarizing somatic current injections.\n\tNOTE: Examples of this procedure can be visualized in Supplementary Video S1, S2. Details of this procedure are provided in the video legends."
