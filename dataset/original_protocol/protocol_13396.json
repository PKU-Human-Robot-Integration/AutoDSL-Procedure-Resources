    "This protocol is approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (University of Utah IACUC Protocol Number 21-09021). Mature New Zealand White rabbits are obtained from commercial vendors.\n1. Animal acquisition\nAcclimate the animals for the required duration after arrival according to institutional protocol, housing animals socially in a vivarium with standard chow diets. The acclimation period at our institution is 2 weeks.\n2. Anesthesia and monitoring\nInduce general endotracheal anesthesia with intramuscular injection of buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg) followed approximately 30 min later with a ketamine (25-35 mg/kg) and xylazine (3 mg/kg) intramuscular injection. Maintain anesthesia with 1%-5% isoflurane in oxygen administered via an endotracheal tube. During induction, use 100% FiO2, and then titrate down to the lowest FiO2 that maintains a 100% SpO2.\n\tNOTE: Uninterrupted anesthesia is necessary to prevent movement by the animal so that the stroke will be the only disruption of the stroke-induction process. This also prevents spikes in BP that would result from agitation that could arise from inadequate anesthesia. Consistent oxygenation is also important to control for achieving comparable strokes. These measures are all accounted for in the representative results described below.\nConfirm adequate depth of anesthesia by applying noxious stimuli to the toe. Apply veterinary eye ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness.\nMonitor oxygen saturation by a pulse oximeter placed on the ear. Obtain intravenous access with an angiocatheter in an auricular vein. Ensure that it is secured with a suture or adhesive transparent film dressing. To mitigate vasospasm, place 0.25 inch of transdermal nitroglycerin on the inside of the ear after induction of anesthesia.\nProvide maintenance fluids with normal saline at a rate of 1 cc/kg/h. Place an esophageal temperature probe to monitor body temperature. Maintain normothermia (33-37 °C) as needed with warming blankets placed under the animal.",
    "3. Surgical preparation\nPlace the rabbit in a supine position on a fluoroscopy-compatible operative table. Extend the head as it optimizes positioning for subsequent angiographic views. Rabbits have exquisitely sensitive arteries prone to vasospasm after instrumentation. \nRemove fur from both the inguinal regions using electric clippers. Next, palpate the bilateral femoral arterial pulses to confirm adequate clearance by trimming bilaterally. Prepare the skin with scrubs of chlorhexidine and alcohol, and then drape the skin in the usual sterile fashion.\nAdminister local anesthesia by subcutaneously injecting 2 mL of 1% lidocaine in the bilateral inguinal regions. Make a 5 cm surgical incision with a number 10 blade at the site where lidocaine was injected. Use blunt dissection to expose the neurovascular bundle (Figure 1A). If needed, extend the incision to adequately expose an arterial segment large enough for access.\nUpon isolation of the neurovascular bundle, drip several drops of 1% lidocaine on the artery to prevent vasospasm. Separate the artery gently from the vein and the adjacent nerve using forceps. Identify the artery by the characteristic appearance of its muscular wall compared to the thin walls of the vein. The artery will have brighter blood, while the vein will contain darker blood.\n4. Arterial access\nAfter the artery has been isolated, pass the right-angle forceps under the vessel. Grasp two vessel loops with the instrument and gently pass them under the artery. Situate one each at the upstream and downstream ends of the exposed vessel.\nSubject the artery to a gentle traction by pulling the vessel loops. At this point, inspect the vessel for any residual tissue, and remove it with gentle dissection (Figure 1B). This increases the chances of successful access.",
    "Use a 22 G angiocatheter for access. Slightly advance the catheter itself over the inner needle since this often sticks when completely seated and can dislodge the device during access attempts.\nAfter dissecting the vessel and preparing the angiocatheter, drip lidocaine on the vessel again. The artery will visibly dilate, which increases the chances of successful access and placement of a sheath using the Seldinger technique.\nApply gentle traction to the downstream vessel loop to engorge the artery by reducing outflow. This also stabilizes the vessel for the access attempt. Slowly advance the needle of the angiocatheter into the middle of the exposed arterial segment (Figure 1C). When a flash of blood is seen in the angiocatheter and the chamber at its hub, advance the catheter over the needle into the arterial lumen.\nIf the access attempt is unsuccessful, achieve hemostasis by applying traction on the upstream vessel loop. Flush the angiocatheter with saline and replace it on its introducer needle for additional attempts.\nWhen the angiocatheter is successfully placed in the vessel to its hub, advance a Cope microwire through the angiocatheter lumen and into the aorta (Figure 1D). Remove the angiocatheter over the wire and replace it with a 5 French slim hydrophilic sheath (Figure 1E).\nConfirm the return of the arterial blood through the sidearm tubing by opening the three-way valve. Flush the sheath with 0.9% saline and lock the valve closed during flushing.\nSecure the sheath hub to the adjacent skin with an additional 3-0 silk suture. Repeat this process for the contralateral femoral artery. For achieving higher efficiencies, two operators can simultaneously work while focusing on one artery each.\n5. Cervicocerebral angiography and intracranial access",
    "Under fluoroscopic visualization, advance a 4 French glide catheter over a 0.035-inch glidewire inserted through the left femoral sheath. Position the tip of the glide catheter in the proximal left vertebral artery. Remove the wire and flush the catheter with heparinized 0.9% saline.\nPerform angiography by hand injecting the left vertebral artery with iodinated contrast under low magnification to visualize the entire head and neck (Figure 2A). Modulate the injection of the contrast solution by starting with a low-pressure injection that crescendos to visualize the entire vasculature.\n\tNOTE: Sufficient injection to visualize the reflux down the right vertebral artery is needed, as this angiographic image will be used for roadmap guidance to select the right vertebral artery efficiently. Gentle injection is needed to minimize vasospasm or more profound injury. Additionally, excessive force or volume can induce transient motion from the animal even under deep anesthesia.\nFor the left vertebral injection, inject 50% contrast diluted in normal saline with a gentle crescendo from a 3 cc syringe. Injecting 1-2 cc of the dilute contrast is typically sufficient. Determine the adequate amount of injection by checking the reflux down the right vertebral artery and into the right subclavian artery. During this injection, also note the posterior cerebral and superior cerebellar arteries, one of which will be the target to occlude with the microcatheter.\nPrepare a 2.4 French flow-directed microcatheter with a 0.010-inch microwire. Make a c-shape on the tip of the microwire. Under roadmap guidance, advance the microcatheter inside a 4 French glide catheter through the right femoral sheath and over the wire into the right vertebral artery. Due to the propensity for catheter-induced vasospasm, minimize the device manipulation time and the number of catheter attempts performed.",
    "Advance the microcatheter through the cervical segment of the right vertebral artery. To best pass the sharp turn from the V2 to V3 segment, advance the microcatheter alone while the microwire is back proximal to its tip. Leading with the microwire at this point will often cause selection of small side branches of the vertebral artery and can be the source of substantial vasospasm.\nAfter passing the sharp turn from V2 to V3, the microcatheter often passes easily to the proximal basilar artery. At this point, advance the microwire and select the desired posterior cerebral or superior cerebellar arteries. Microcatheter injections are not advised given the fragile nature of the intracranial arteries.\nAdvance the microcatheter over the microwire into the target artery. Choose a proximal position as it is typically safest in the posterior to communicate due to its angulation at its origin. A deeper position is feasible in the superior cerebellar artery (Figure 2B).\nRepeat the angiogram by injecting the left vertebral artery catheter with high magnification over the head to confirm occlusion of the target artery (Figure 2B-C). For optimal imaging, inject full strength contrast in the 3 cc syringe. Typically, no more than 1 cc will be required for adequate opacification of all intracranial arteries.\nGently remove the microwire from the microcatheter under fluoroscopic visualization to confirm a stable position. Place a stopcock on the hub of the microcatheter and close the stopcock to prevent blood loss from retrograde blood flow. Remove the left vertebral catheter to make the left femoral access sheath available.\nDuring the ensuing occlusion period, acquire intermittent fluoroscopic images to confirm a stable position of the occlusive microcatheter. Results of posterior cerebral artery occlusion periods ranging from 60-240 min have been published previously18.\n6. Blood pressure measurement and modulation",
    "While one femoral access site is utilized for the occlusive intracranial microcatheter, use the contralateral sheath for BP measurement.\nRecord continuous arterial BP readings with a 3 French gauge piezoresistive sensor, placed through a femoral sheath and advanced until the sensor tip is in the lower thoracic aorta. Connect this sensor to data acquisition hardware and visualize measured pressures with its associated software. Observe BP in the pressure visualization window. BP recordings can be exported into a spreadsheet for visualization in the statistics software.\nAlternatively, if mechanical manipulation of BP is desired using a balloon catheter, advance a 4 French 5 mm Fogarty balloon catheter through the available femoral sheath. Position the balloon in the infrarenal aorta. Use the 0.025-inch inner lumen for pressure tracing to continuously monitor BP upstream of the balloon and the 4 French diameter of the balloon for a second BP tracing line to be connected to the sheath for continuous monitoring of BP downstream of the balloon.\n7. Euthanasia and tissue harvesting\nRemove the occlusive microcatheter after 3 h, and then continue arterial BP measurement and modulation for the additional desired period. A standard recovery period of 3 h is used for visualization of a completed infarct on subsequent histology.\nAfter completing the prescribed occlusion and recovery times, ensure that the animal is in a surgical plane of anesthesia and perform euthanasia (perfusion fixation with phosphate buffered solution, followed by decapitation after confirmation of absence of cardiac activity). Alternatively, perform perfusion fixation by infusing perfusate through a femoral sheath, and then transecting a jugular vein, the inferior vena cava, or the right atrium.\n\tNOTE: Perfusion may be preferable for some postmortem analyses since gene expression or biomarker values may be affected by the solution. Both the techniques have been performed successfully by our group.",
    "In acute procedures with immediate harvesting of the brain, confirm euthanasia and decapitate the animal. Remove calvarium in a piecemeal fashion with rongeurs, starting at the occipital ridge and working anteriorly until the brain can be harvested intact. Place the brain in formalin or optimal cutting temperature solution and flash freeze, depending on the type of tissue analysis desired.\nSubscription Required.
