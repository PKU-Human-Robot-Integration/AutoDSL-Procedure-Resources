    "1. Human neuron induction from human pluripotent stem cells\nLentivirus preparation (~5 days, detailed protocol as described previously16)\n\t\nPlate ~1 million HEK293T cells each T75 flask, to have them ~40% confluent when performing transfection. Transfect them with plasmids expressing tetracycline-inducible Ngn2 and puromycin-resistant gene (PuroR; under the same TetO promoter control), rtTA and the three helper plasmids pRSV-REV, pMDLg/pRRE, and VSV-G (12 µg of lentiviral vector DNA and 6 µg of each of the helper plasmid DNA). Prepare at least three flasks per lentivirus preparation. Use PEI for transfection following the manufacturer’s instruction. Change the media after 16 h and discard.\nHarvest released viral particles by collecting culture media every day and replace with fresh media for 3 days. Pool the collected media containing viral particles for purification. Filter the virus through a 0.22 µm filter and centrifuge at 49,000 x g for 90 min. Resuspend the pellet in the appropriate volume of PBS-glucose (~150 µL).\nNeuron Induction (~5 days)\n\tNOTE: This induction protocol (Figure 1A; flow diagram) is highly effective for both iPS and ES cells of validated pluripotency (which can be assayed by immunohistochemistry staining of well-characterized pluripotency markers; Figure 1B).\n\t\nUse commercially available H1 human ES cells at the passage of 52 (see Table of Materials). Culture the cells on extracellular matrix solution coated 6-well plates (~0.5 mg of matrix solution per 6-well plate; see Table of Materials) using ES cell maintenance medium (see Table of Materials) and incubate the plates at 37 °C with 5% CO2.",
    "On Day -2, detach ES cells (80% confluent) with 1 mL of cell detachment solution (see Table of Materials) and incubate at room temperature for 10 min. Transfer the cells to a tube; wash the well with 2 mL of media and combine in the same tube. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min, resuspend the pellet in media, and plate the cells onto matrix coated 6-well plates at the seeding density of 1 x 105 cells per well.\nOn Day -1, add lentiviruses expressing Ngn2 plus PuroR and rtTA together with polybrene (8 µg/ml) to the ES cells in fresh ES cell maintenance medium (see Table of Materials). The exact amount of viruses should be determined by actual titers or the titration. We typically add 5 µL each virus per well in a 6-well plate.\nOn Day 0, add Doxycycline (2 µg/mL, to activate Ngn2 expression) in DMEM-F12 medium with N2 supplement without morphogens.\nOn Day 1, add Puromycin in fresh medium of DMEM-F12 plus N2 and doxycycline, to the final concentration of 1 µg/mL medium. Select the transduced cells in Puromycin for at least 24 h. Higher Puromycin concentration (up to 5 µg/mL) and longer selection period (up to 48 h) may be required to adequately remove the under-transduced cells if the virus titer is low.\nOn Day 2, detach differentiating neurons with cell detachment solution (see Table of Materials), and re-plate them on 24-well plates (between 80,000–200,000 cells/well) coated with matrix solution (see Table of Materials), and maintain them in NBA/B27 medium without doxycycline. The seeding density is critical.",
    "At this stage, detached neurons can be frozen in specialized commercial freezing medium (see Table of Materials) and stored in liquid nitrogen for up to 3 months. Pure neurons can be plated accounting for the typical ~15%–20% cell death post-thaw, cultured alone or co-cultured with other brain cell types (see step 3.2.3. for co-culturing with OPCs).\nCulture pure iNs on the plates coated with extracellular matrix-based solutions as instructed by the manufacturer (see Table of Materials). The characteristic pyramidal morphology should be apparent by Day 4 (and Day 6; Figure 1C). The synapse formation can be detected as early as Day 14 to 16 and is prominent at Day 24 by immunohistochemical staining with standard pre- and post-synaptic markers. (Figure 1D; labeled with the pre-synaptic marker Synapsin 1 and the dendritic marker Map2).\n2. Human oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPCs) induction from pluripotent stem cells and oligodendrocyte maturation\nNeural Progenitor Cell (NPC) generation: monolayer protocol (~7 days). See Figure 2A for the flow diagram.\n\t\nCulture H1 human ES cells as described earlier (see step 1.2.1.) and trans-differentiate them into neural progenitor cells (NPCs) by an established approach called dual SMADi, with small molecule inhibitors for multiple signaling pathways. Here we use a widely accepted commercial kit and follow the monolayer protocol provided by the manufacturer (see Table of Materials).\nOn Day -1, plate 0.5–1 x 106 cells per well in a 6-well plate coated by a growth factor reduced matrix solution (see Table of Materials; ~0.5 mg of matrix solution per 6-well plate) with ES cell maintenance medium (see Table of Materials). This growth factor reduced matrix solution is used to coat all the plates that will be used in the following steps.",
    "On Day 0, treat cells for 24 h with ES cell maintenance medium (see Table of Materials) supplemented by 2% DMSO.\nOn Day 1–6, change the full media with warm (37 °C) neural induction medium containing the SMAD inhibitors from the commercial kit (see Table of Materials). If cells divide and reach confluence before Day 7, passage them to the seeding density of 0.5–1 x 106, as described earlier in step 2.1.2.\nOn Day 7, passage NPCs using cell detachment solution (see Table of Materials) and plate at a seeding density of 1–2 x 105 cells/well of a 24-well plate.\nAssay the differentiation efficiency by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for absence of pluripotency marker, OCT4 for example, and presence of NPC markers such as PAX6, Nestin, and Sox1.\nAt this stage, detached NPCs can be frozen in the specialized commercial NPC freezing media (see Table of Materials) and stored in liquid nitrogen for up to 3 months. After freeze-and-thaw for once, NPCs still retain the multipotency to give rise to neurons, astrocytes, and OPCs with reliable protocols.\nOligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) generation (~7 days). Please see Figure 2A for the flow diagram.\n\t\nOn Day 7, passage NPCs using cell detachment solution (see Table of Materials) and plate them at a seeding density of 1–2 x 105 cells per well in a 24-well plate in warm (37 °C) neural induction medium plus SMAD inhibitors from the commercial kit (see Table of Materials).\nOn Day 8, prepare a solution of 1% DMSO in the OPC differentiation medium and treat the plated NPCs for 24 h. The OPC differentiation medium is composed of: DMEM/F12 medium, 1% N2 supplement, 1% B27 supplement, bFGF at 20 ng/mL, SAG at 1 µM, PDGF-AA at 10 ng/mL (see Table of Materials).",
    "On Day 9, replace media with fresh OPC differentiation medium without DMSO. Feed the cells every other day until Day 15. If the cells reach confluence before Day 15, passage them to the seeding density of 1–2 x 105 cells per well as described in step 2.2.1.\nOn Day 14, plate OPCs in OPC differentiation medium at a density of 1–2 x 105 cells/well in a 24-well plate.\nAt this stage (Day 15), test cells for the presence of OPC-specific markers by IHC staining or qPCR (e.g., O4, Olig1/2, CSPG4/Ng2, NKX2.2, PDGFRa; Figure 2B) and for the absence of NPC markers (Pax6 or Nestin; Figure 2D). We typically detect the O4 immunoreactivity in more than 95% of the cells at Day 15. Of particular relevance to Alzheimer’s disease, the expression of APP (amyloid precursor protein), BACE1 (the processing protease β-secreatase 1), and peptide amyloid-β (Aβ) is abundant in OPCs (Figure 2F).\nOligodendrocyte (OL) maturation (~7–20 days)\n\t\nOn Day 15, replace media with OL maturation medium: Neurobasal-A medium, 2% B27 supplement, 1 µM cAMP, 200 ng/mL T3 triiodothyronine, and Clemastine of 1 µM (see Table of Materials). Change the medium every other day or every day, if necessary.\nWhen cells reach 90% confluence, split at a 1:3 ratio up to 2 passages or until cell division slows down substantially. If OPCs divide too fast and reach confluency in less than 3 days, add Ara-C (see Table of Materials) at a concentration of 2–5 µM for 1–3 days. Active proliferation indicates lowered maturation efficiency.\nExamine the efficiency of oligodendroglial maturation by assessing the expression of OL markers, e.g., CLDN11, PLP1, MBP by qPCR, IHC staining or immunoblotting. The characteristic morphology of highly complex structures (Figure 2C) and the expression of OL markers (Figure 2E) should be readily detected by Day 28.",
    "3. Co-culturing of human induced neurons (iNs) and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (iOPCs)\niOPC plating (~3 days)\n\t\nPlate iOPCs at Day 14 at a density of 1 x 105 cells per well in a 24-well plate (as described above in step 2.2.4.) in OPC differentiation medium (as described in step 2.2.2.).\niN-iOPC co-culture set up\n\t\nOn Day 15, detach the induced human neurons at the step of Day 2 after the Puromycin selection (as described in step 1.2.6.) with cell detachment solution (see Table of Materials).\nAdd neurons onto the cultured OPCs, plating at the seeding density of 2 x 105 cells per well in the 24-well plate with growing OPCs (from step 3.1.1). Use the co-culture medium containing Neurobasal-A medium, 2% B27 supplement, and 100 ng/mL T3 triiodothyronine. Change the medium on the next day and then every other day afterwards. If OPCs proliferate too fast and reach confluency in less than 3 days, add Ara-C at a concentration of 2–5 µM. A representative image of the iNs and iOPCs grown in co-culture after 7 days neurons is shown in Figure 3A.\nUse frozen neurons prepared as described above in step 1.2.7 for co-culturing with OPCs. Plate freeze-and-thaw neurons at a higher density of 3 x 105 cells per well.\nAfter Day 14–16 in co-cultures, the synapse formation in iNs can be observed by IHC staining of pre- and post-synaptic markers, and by Day 21 the synaptic puncta should be abundant (Figure 3C) and neuronal activities can be reliably recorded.\nStarting at Day 21, test cells for OL specific markers (for example, MBP and PLP1). By Day 28, we normally observe the phenomenon ensheathing of iN axons by iOL processes, labeled by IHC staining for specific markers (Figure 3B; neurofilament NF for iN axons and MBP for iOPC processes).",
