    "All the procedures for animal handling have been approved by the Italian Ministry of Health (D.M. 204/2011-B).\n1. Animals\nGrow​ C57BL6/J female mice to 8 weeks of age in individually ventilated cages with microisolation filters.\n\tNote: Females are preferred because the anatomic conformation of their external uro-genital apparatus renders the catheterization easier than in males.\n2. Cell Culture\nMaintain the mouse urothelial carcinoma cell line MB49 in RPMI 1,640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum and 50 µg/ml gentamicin at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2.\nGrow MB49 cells in T-75 flasks to 80% confluence. Trypsinize and resuspend at 0.5 × 105 - 0.5 × 106 cells per 150 μl of PBS before implantation in mice.\n3. Intravesical Tumour Implant\nAnesthetize mice using a mix of the anaesthetics zoletil and xylor (33 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively), injected intraperitoneally.\nPlace animals in a supine position and fix the hind legs to the pad with scotch tape. Paws have to be sufficiently separated to render the urethral meatus well visible and easily accessible for the insertion of the catheter.\nNote: For the catheterization, a 24 G paediatric venous catheter is suitable for 8 to 10 weeks-old mice. The choice of catheter is very important in order to avoid leakage of liquid between the urethral wall and the catheter. Larger bore catheters must be used for bigger or older mice.\nUsing a small nipper, pinch one edge of the external part of urethra and twist it very gently toward the “head end” of the mice. This action exposes the urethral meatus.",
    "Remove the internal needle of the catheter and insert the latter in the urethra at an angle of 45°, slightly oriented towards the “tail end” of the mice. Do not force the entrance of catheter; in case of resistance, just twist the catheter very gently, until it slips inside the urethra. When about 0.5-0.8 cm of the catheter is in the urethra, carefully place the catheter parallel to the tail of the mice and insert it completely.\nUsing a 1 ml syringe, the needle of which has to be inserted in the catheter, wash the bladder from residual urine by injecting 200-300 μl of sterile PBS and aspirate all the liquid from the bladder.\nNote: When injecting PBS, the bladder will fill up and a swelling will be visible between the hind legs of the mice; this confirms that the catheterization is correct. Most catheters have a dead volume that must be considered when calculating the injection volume.\nUsing a sterile 1 ml syringe, inject 200 μl of 0.1 N HCl. Fill the bladder in order to burn its entire wall. After 10 sec, remove all the acid and immediately neutralize by injecting 200 μl of 0.1 N NaOH with a sterile syringe. In case of injection of the highest number of cells (0.5 × 106), the acidification step is not required.\nAspirate all the residual liquid and immediately flush the cavity with 300 µl of sterile PBS.\nEmpty the bladder by aspiration, and inject 150 μl of PBS containing MB49 cells (range 0.5 × 105 - 0.5 × 106) into the bladder. Leave the syringe assembled to the catheter to avoid the leakage of cells. It is better to secure the syringe by fixing it to the pad with scotch tape.",
    "After 1 hr, gently extract the catheter from the urethra, and place the mice in the cage, under an incandescent lamp until they awake: this usually occurs between 1 and 2 hr after the end of the treatment.\n4. Intravesical Delivery of HP-NAP\nNote: At least 3 days after cell instillation, it is possible to begin the treatment.\nCatheterize as described in steps 3.1 to 3.4. At this stage, it is not necessary to burn the bladder wall with HCl.\nUsing a 1 ml syringe, wash the bladder from residual urine by injecting 200-300 μl of sterile PBS and aspirate all the liquid from the bladder.\nInject 50 μg of HP-NAP per 150 μl PBS into the bladder. Leave the syringe attached to the catheter to avoid leakage of the protein solution. Secure the syringe by fixing it to the pad with scotch tape.\nAfter 1 hr, gently extract the catheter from the urethra and place the mice in the cage, under an incandescent lamp, until they awake.\n5. Tumour Explants and Histological Analysis\nAt the end of the treatment, sacrifice the animals, place them in supine positions and fix the hind legs to the pad with scotch tape.\nUsing a surgical scalpel, make a vertical incision about 1.52 cm long through the skin and the peritoneum, starting just above external genitalia to the “head end” of the mice. To minimize the risk of damaging the bladder, pay particular attention to the depth of the cut.\nThe bladder will be positioned in the centre-left of the cut and the tumour will be visible as a dark pink/violet mass. Upon its excision, place the entire bladder in a histological cage and fix in 10% buffered formalin before embedding in paraffin.",
    "For histological and immune histochemical analysis, prepare serial sections of the bladder (46 µm thickness) using a standard microtome.\nStain the sections with haematoxylin/eosin and proceed with the calculation of tumour size (D x d2) and determining the percentage of necrosis per cross-sectional area using a computer assisted image analyser.\nFor vessel counting, proceed by staining the sections for the endothelial marker CD31/PECAM, using a standard immunoperoxidase technique. Scan the sections at low power (4×) to identify the area of highest vascular density. Within this region, count individual microvessels in five separate random fields at high power (20×).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
