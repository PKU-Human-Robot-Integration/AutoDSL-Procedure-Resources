  "procedures": [
    "Ethics Statement: The procedures described below follow the University of Maryland Baltimore County animal care guidelines.\n1. Analysis of Stable and Dynamic MTs Using Immunolabeling (Protocol 1)\nManual dechorionation of embryos prior to fixation\nObtain freshly spawned embryos by pouring off excess system water and then collecting remaining embryos into a plastic Petri dish (refer to Table of Materials).\nRemove any debris from the system water and transfer embryos to a new dish filled with embryo medium (refer to Table of Materials) to ensure that the embryos develop in a clean environment.\nAllow the embryos to develop to the desired stage in a temperature-controlled incubator at 28.5 °C.\nPlace embryos younger than 24 h post-fertilization (hpf) in a glass dish prior to dechorionation.\n\t\tNOTE: Dechorionate embryos prior to fixation to maximize rapid penetration of the fixative and preserve MT integrity. Use embryo medium instead of system water to provide the additional Ca2+ required during dechorionation.\nManually remove the chorions from embryos while in Petri dish, using fine forceps under a dissecting microscope.\n\t\t\nPinch a small area in the round, transparent chorion that encircles the embryo with a pair of forceps and gently pull forceps apart to create a rupture in the membrane.\nEnlarge the opening by delicately prying on the ruptured chorion using forceps. Be careful not to touch the embryo with the forceps as it could rupture.\nFixation of staged embryos\nTransfer staged, dechorionated embryos to 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. Remove as much embryo medium as possible using a glass Pasteur pipette.",
    "NOTE: Perform fixation and drug treatments on young (mid-somitogenesis) embryos, prior to the formation of the neural centers mediating pain sensation, which require no additonal procedure to alleviate pain during euthanasia. Developmental stages are as defined in Kimmel et al., 199525. The 4-5 and 11-12 somite stages were used to obtain images for Figures 2 and 3.\nPrepare 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/MT assembly buffer (MAB) fixative (refer to Table of Materials) by combining 1 mL 8% PFA per 1 mL 2X MAB and adding 2 µL 100% Triton X-100 per 1 mL of total volume.\n\t\tCAUTION: Wear gloves while handling solutions containing PFA and Triton X-100, which are skin irritants.\nFix embryos in 1 mL 4% PFA/MAB fixative for 5 min at 28.5 °C. Aspirate the fixative with a pipette, replace it with 1 mL fresh fixative, and incubate for 3 h at room temperature (RT) on a rocker.\n\t\tNOTE: Samples must be fixed quickly at their biological temperature (28.5 °C for zebrafish) to prevent temperature-dependent MT depolymerization.\nAspirate fixative and add 1 mL 1x Tris-buffered saline with NP40 (TBS-NP40) buffer. Gently agitate at RT on a rocker three times for 5 min each. Store embryos at 4 °C in 1 mL fresh 1X TBS-NP40 for no more than 7 days.\n\tCAUTION: Wear gloves when handling solutions containing NP-40, a skin irritant.\nSectioning embryos for immunolabeling\nHeat RT 4% low melting point (LMP) agarose embedding medium in a closed container until the solution becomes clear using a hot plate set to 50 °C positioned close to a dissecting microscope. Keep the container closed between samples and heated throughout the embedding process (steps 1.4.4-1.4.6).\nTransfer embryos from the 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes to a Petri dish using a glass pipette and fill it with 1X TBS-NP40.",
    "Remove the large yolk cells from somitogenesis stage embryos (4-5 and 11-12 somites) in the Petri dish using fine forceps under the magnification of a dissecting microscope26. Hold the embryo by the tail bud with one pair of forceps and peel away the yolk cells with the other pair in order to preserve the hindbrain tissue. Transfer the de-yolked embryos to an area of the Petri dish free of yolk debris.\n\t\tNOTE: Embed embryos in the agarose-filled mold individually to prevent premature hardening of the LMP agarose.\nFill one 12 mm x 5 mm x 3 mm well of the sectioning mold with 200 µL melted LMP agarose using a micropipette. Perform the steps 1.4.5.-1.4.6. quickly (within 20 s of filling the mold) to embed embryo before the LMP agarose cools to RT and solidifies.\nUse fine forceps to transfer a de-yolked embryo by the tailbud from the Petri dish to the agarose-filled mold toward its tapered end under a dissecting microscope.\nUse fine forceps to orient the embryo into the mold such that the vibratome cuts in the desired plane. Create transverse sections by orienting the embryo such that the hindbrain tissue runs parallel to the length of the mold with its dorsal surface facing the edge and its anterior surface facing the tapered region end. Repeat steps 1.4.4-1.4.6 for the remaining embryos.\nAllow the agarose embedding to solidify for 5 min at RT.\nGenerate 40 µm sections of the tallest axis of the agarose embedded embryos (steps 1.4.1-1.4.7) using a vibratome with the sectioning dish filled with 1x TBS-NP40. Transfer sections of interest to a 24-well plate in 500 µL 1x TBS-NP40 using fine forceps. Place the sections of only one embryo per well.",
    "NOTE: Refer to reference18 for more details. Ensure that sections remain hydrated at all times in at least 250 µL of buffer and rock at low speed (10-25 rpm) for remaining steps to prevent separation from agarose embedding. Detergents present in the blocking and wash solutions should reduce the surface tension of the liquid medium and allow submersion of the sections. Check that sections remain in the wells during and after all manipulations. Use caution to prevent accidentally discarding sections during washes.\nRemove the buffer and add 500 µL of blocking solution. Rock for at least 1 h at RT.\n\tNOTE: Use a blocking solution that contains 5% sera from the host species of each secondary antibody to be used (refer to Table of Materials).\nIncubate in 300 µL primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer for 36-72 h at 4 °C on a rocker. Wash twice in 600 µL 1x TBS-NP40 on a rocker for 30 min each, at RT.\n\tNOTE: Double-label sections by incubating in primary antibodies against total MTs (anti β-tubulin, or anti α-tubulin) and stable MTs (anti-Glu-tubulin) or dynamic MTs (anti-Tyr tubulin). Select primary antibodies that have been raised in different host species when double labeling for total and post-translationally modified α-tubulin populations. Refer to Table of Materials for antibody dilutions.\nIncubate in 300 µL of fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer on a rocker for 16-24 h, at 4 °C in the dark. Wash twice in 600 µL 1x TBS-NP40 on a rocker for 30 min each, at RT.",
    "NOTE: Wrap the multi-well dish containing secondary antibody in foil from this point onwards and after each manipulation to prevent quenching. Select secondary antibodies that react with the host immunoglobulin of the primary antibody. Choose secondary antibody fluorophores that have separate, non-overlapping emission spectra. Refer to Table of Materials for antibody dilutions.\nIncubate the embryos in 500 µL of DAPI solution on a rocker for 30 min, at RT. Wash three times in TBS-NP40 rocking at RT for 5 min each.\n\tNOTE: Nuclear labeling provides cellular context for the MT quantification performed in step 1.12.\nPlace a drop of mounting medium with anti-fade agent on the center of a dust-free slide. Use fine forceps to transfer sections to the mounting medium droplet. Place a dust-free coverslip on top of the sample. Store slides in a dry, dark, and cool place, wrapped in foil, until imaging is performed.\n\tNOTE: Circling the sections on the back of the slide using a fine-tipped permanent marker prior to imaging will help to identify sections when using the microscope.\nConfocal Imaging\nMount sections on an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope by affixing the slide to the stage with the coverslip facing the objective. Determine the appropriate optics (objective, laser, and channel settings such as gain and offset) on a control slide and keep them consistent between samples27. Avoid oversaturating the pixels to prevent data loss.\nCapture Z-stacks confocal images using channel settings for the selected secondary antibody fluorophores and save the image files27. Acquire Z-stacks for each section.",
    "NOTE: Replicate the parameters used to acquire the images in Figures 2 and 3 by using the following acquisition settings: mode = XYZ; objective magnification = 63X oil immersion lens; objective numerical aperture = 1.4; Z-step = 0.1 µm; Z-depth = 16.23 µm. Use the following channel settings: DAPI excitation with 20% UV-range laser, emission filter range = 430-480 nm, photomultiplier (PMT) gain = 525 V, and PMT offset = -1.72%; 448 nm fluorophore (refer to Table of Materials) excitation with 20% 488 nm laser, emission filter range = 493-573 nm, PMT gain = 689 V, and PMT offset = -0.2%; 594 nm fluorophore excitation with 32% 594 nm laser, emission filter range = 608-706 nm, PMT gain = 768 V, and PMT offset = -6.8%.\nSave raw data files with unique, descriptive file names and create a copy for editing in image analysis software.\nCompilation of Z-stacks for displaying maximum projections\nOpen the data file copy using public domain 3-D image analysis software (e.g., ImageJ). Check that each channel appears as an individual image sequence (Z-stacks).\nSplit image channels by using the following menu sequence : “Images/Color/Split channels”.\nCreate a merged image by overlaying the channels of interest by using the following menu sequence: \"Images/Color/Merge channels.\" Select the 594 nm, 488 nm, and DAPI channels to be false colored red, green, and blue, respectively. Check \"Create composite\" and select \"OK\"28.\n\t\tNOTE: Omit the DAPI channel to better convey detail specific to MTs in a maximum projection as in Figure 2 and 3, by only selecting false colors for the other two channels.",
    "Examine the merged Z-stack and make note of the beginning and ending positions of the inner best Z-planes for all visible channels. Dismiss the outer Z-planes that typically have suboptimal signal due to the uneven surfaces of the section. Refer to reference29 for details.\nVisualize the merged Z-stack as a single 2-D image by performing a maximum intensity projection of the Z-stack using the following 3-D image analysis menu sequence: \"Images/Stack/Z-project.\" Enter the starting and ending positions of the inner best Z-planes from step 1.11.3 as the \"Start slice\" and \"Stop slice,\" respectively. Select \"Max intensity\" as the projection type and click \"OK\". Refer to reference28 for more details.\nAnalyzing MT labeling\nOpen the commercial 3-D image analysis software. Select \"Create Library\" and provide a descriptive name for the image library. Click \"Create.\" Drag raw image files generated from the confocal microscope into the library. Larger files require more time to transfer.\nSelect a file to analyze. Choose \"Extended Focus\" from the \"view\" menu to display the channel-merged image in the main window.\nAdjust the thresholding by dragging the slider tool for each channel to the left or right until the background signal is reduced and the true signal is robust. Observe that each channel shows a true signal for the molecule labeled (e.g., DAPI channel showing oblong or mitotic nuclei but not auto-fluorescence from the cytoplasm or agarose).\nSelect the \"Freehand Region of Interest (ROI)\" tool and outline the region of interest to be analyzed. Select the \"Actions\" tab followed by \"Crop to Selection\" to crop the image. Save the cropped image file under a new name. Click the \"Measurements\" tab to create the protocol for filtering specific objects relevant to the 3-D analysis.",
    "Drag \"Find Objects\" to the protocol window. Rename the first protocol \"DAPI.\" Select the DAPI channel in the dropdown menu. Drag the following settings to the DAPI protocol and place them below \"Find Objects\" in the following order (Table 1): \"Fill Holes in Objects\"; \"Separate Touching Objects\"; \"Exclude Objects by Size\"; \"Exclude Not Touching ROIs\".\n\t\tNOTE: The goal of the settings in Table 1 are to first set a threshold that discards signals whose distribution and size are inconsistent with the size of objects being analyzed. For example, eliminate a signal not large enough to be a nucleus when counting nuclei.\nPerform the sequence (step 1.12.9) to assemble the remaining filters for β-tubulin and other markers using the settings in Table 1.\nSelect \"Measure\" at the bottom of each protocol. Choose \"Intensity and Volume Measurement\" and \"Skeletal Length\" for all tubulin labeling, but only the former for the DAPI signal.\nDraw an ROI around the region to be measured. Observe the measurements under the \"Summary\" tab after the software processes the region. Copy the data and save them to a workable spreadsheet, as in Table 2. Create a back-up copy of the spreadsheet for later analysis.\nSelect measurements of interest (for example, length of MT bundle, number of MT bundles/nucleus, as revealed with different markers) in the spreadsheet and analyze to determine the averages for each group.\n\t\tNOTE: The average MT bundle length = the sum of the 'mean skeletal length for β-tubulin' for each embryo divided by the total number of embryos. Refer to row 20 of Table 2. Format the spreadsheet so that variables and experimental groups are easily graphed.\n2. De Novo MT Assembly Assay (Protocol 2)\nConstruct and test the multi-well flow-through apparatus (Figure 1) 2 days prior to the experiment.",
    "NOTE: The apparatus enables simultaneous washout of multiple experimental groups following nocodazole treatment using supplies from Table of Materials. Silicone sealer requires at least 24 h of drying time before it poses no toxicity risk to the embryos.\n\t\nSplit a 50 mL centrifuge tube in half lengthwise, using a jig or band saw.\nCut 7 semi-circles, with a radius of 3 cm, out of 70 µm nylon mesh and trim them to fit tightly into one half of the split centrifuge tube. Glue the semi-circles into the centrifuge tube parallel to the 10 mL gradation markings using aquarium-safe silicon sealer. Allow the device to dry for 2 days and rinse by soaking in a beaker of water for 2-3 h.\nLine the top (threaded) end of the cut centrifuge tube with modeling clay such that the height of the liquid retained in the flow-through device has a depth of ¼ inch (Figure 1, views 2 and 3).\nPrepare the washout apparatus by removing the plunger from a 50-mL syringe and inserting 12 inches of fine tubing into the tip. Push the tubing in as far as it will go and seal around the joint using modeling clay.\nPre-wet the mesh using embryo medium to allow the liquid to run through the entire flow-through device. Angle the device on ice so that liquid pools in all compartments but still empties out the front where the clay rim is located. Using a ring stand, suspend the washout apparatus above the flow-through device on ice (Figure 1).\nChill 200 mL of embryo medium on ice and pour enough into the washout apparatus to ensure that all air bubbles are cleared and that the flow rate is approximately 7 mL/min. Adjust the flow rate by changing the height of the syringe.\nEnzymatically dechorionate embryos",
    "Make a working solution of non-specific protease by diluting 1 mL of 10 mg/mL non-specific protease stock in 20 mL embryo medium.\nPerform chemical dechorionation on embryos 1 h prior to the timepoint when they are expected to reach the desired developmental stage. Digest chorions by removing embryo medium from 100 mm Petri dishes containing staged embryos and adding 20 mL of non-specific protease working solution.\nIncubate embryos at 37 °C for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not exceed 5 min or use a higher concentration of non-specific protease solution, as this will result in the embryos falling apart once treated with nocodazole.\nQuickly pipette out non-specific protease and refill dishes with approximately 25 mL embryo medium. Repeat once.\nUsing a 1-mL glass pipette, transfer embryos younger than 24 hpf to glass dishes to protect them from damage.\nComplete dechorionation by manually removing chorions using a pair of fine forceps, as described in step 1.1.5.\nPlace glass Petri dishes containing dechorionated embryos in a 28.5 °C incubator for a minimum of 30 min until they reach the desired developmental stage.\nDepolymerize the existing MTs\nPrepare a working solution of 5 µg/mL nocodazole by combining 50 µL 1 mg/mL stock nocodazole with 10 mL ice cold embryo medium.\n\t\tCAUTION: Use gloves when handling nocodazole, a skin irritant.\nExchange the embryo medium of the nocodazole treatment group with 10 mL cold nocodazole working solution. Place Petri dishes on ice for an appropriate time for the developmental stage (for example, 1 h for 4-5 somite embryos). Set aside untreated control embryos in a Petri dish on ice to be fixed alongside washout samples in step 2.3.4.1.",
    "Transfer embryos using a fire polished 1-mL glass pipette to the flow-through apparatus, using separate compartments for each experimental group. Start the nocodazole washout by pouring ice cold embryo medium into the top of the 50 mL syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: Use at least 30 embryos per experimental group. Experimental groups could consist of control embryos or a variety of morpholino or RNA-injected embryos. The washout will require a total of about 150 mL of embryo medium to be added every 8-10 min. Washout the nocodazole while continuing to inhibit MT growth with ice. Keeping the embryos on ice is essential for the success of this assay because MTs are unstable at cold temperatures and cold delays the development in early embryos.\nAllow MTs to regrow after 20 min of washout at RT by transferring embryos to glass Petri dishes containing warm (28.5 °C) embryo medium using a fire polished 1 mL glass pipette. As soon as the embryos are transferred, start a timer.\n\t\t\nFix the control and washout embryos at 1 min, 5 min and 10 min by pipetting approximately 10 embryos into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube filled with 1 mL 4% PFA/MAB fix (28.5 °C) and following the directions in step 1.2.3.\nPrepare samples for immunolabeling as described in sections 1.3-1.5.\nImmunolabel floating sections and image embryos as described in sections 1.6-1.10 with the following changes to primary antibody specifications: use 1:500 rabbit anti-γ-tubulin and 1:200 mouse anti-β-tubulin.\nProcess and analyze images using 3-D image analysis software, as described in step 1.12.\nSubscription Required.
