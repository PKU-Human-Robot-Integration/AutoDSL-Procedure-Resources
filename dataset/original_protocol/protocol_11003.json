    "The Italian Ministry of Public Health approved all the animal experiments described, in conformity with the Directive 2010/63/EU on the use and care of animals. The local Ethical Committee approved the study, under registration number 70213. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved. Before starting, all the solutions and the equipment should be prepared (section 1) and the fish should be crossed (section 2).\n1. Preparation of solutions and equipment\nNOTE: See Table 1 for the solutions and media to be prepared.\nAgarose gel support\n\t\nWeigh the agarose powder in a microwavable flask and dissolve it in a given volume of E3 zebrafish medium to make a 1% gel. Heat in a microwave until the agarose has completely dissolved.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not overboil the solution.\nPour the melted agarose into a Petri dish and wait until the gel has completely solidified.\nMake small agarose cylinders (~5 mm high) using a plastic Pasteur pipette with the tip cut off. Once prepared, store in a Petri dish at 4 °C wrapped in aluminum foil.\nGlass microneedles\n\t\nPull the borosilicate glass capillaries with a puller to obtain fine needles (settings: HEAT 990, PULL 550).\n\t\t​NOTE: From one capillary, it is possible to obtain two fine needles with a tip diameter of 10 µm.\n2. Fish crossing and egg collection\nTransfer adult fish in breeding tanks 3 days prior to tissue implantation, as described by Avdesh et al.17.\n​NOTE: A ratio of 1:1 or 2:3 males to females is recommended. The fish density should be a maximum five fish per liter of water. Keep males and females separated with a barrier overnight.\nThe next day, remove the barrier and allow the fish to mate.\nRemove the fish from the breeding tanks and return them to their housing tanks.",
    "Pour the water from the breeding tank through a fine mesh net. Transfer the fertilized eggs to a Petri dish with E3 zebrafish medium.\nCheck the Petri dish with a stereomicroscope and discard the cloudy eggs. Keep the fertilized eggs in fresh E3 zebrafish medium at 28 °C.\n3. Specimen collection\nNOTE: Autoclave forceps and a scalpel handle.\nImmediate processing\n\t\nCollect the surgical specimen of tumor in 10 mL of tumor medium at 4 °C (tumor specimen ranging from 5 mm to 10 mm in diameter). Transfer the sample at 4 °C from the desired location for immediate processing.\nStorage overnight (optional)\n\t\nCollect the surgical tumor specimen in 10 mL of tumor medium and store the sample overnight at 4 °C.\nStorage at -80 °C (optional, least recommended)\n\t\nStore the sample at -80 °C in a cryogenic vial with tumor medium supplemented with 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).\n4. Sample processing\nNOTE: Perform the steps under a sterile tissue culture laminar flow hood.\nWash the whole tumor tissue with 5 mL of fresh tumor medium, pipetting up and down 10x using a plastic Pasteur pipette. Aspirate and discard the washing medium. Repeat this step 3x.\n\tNOTE: Avoid aspiration of the tumor tissue as it could remain attached to the plastic Pasteur pipette.\nTransfer the sample in a Petri dish and immerge it in 1-2 mL of fresh tumor medium. Cut the tumor sample into small pieces (1-2 mm3) using a scalpel blade and place them in a sterile 5 mL plastic tube with tumor medium.\nSet the McIlwain tissue chopper to 100 µm thickness. Place the specimen fragments on the circular plastic table of the chopper and chop them. Rotate the table by 90° and repeat the chopping.",
    "Centrifuge the fragments at 300 × g for 3 min. Then, carefully aspirate the supernatant and discard it.\nIncubate the fragments with a fluorescent cell tracker, CM-DiI (final concentration of 10 µg/mL in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline [DPBS]), Deep Red (final concentration of 1 µL/mL in DPBS), or CellTrace (final concentration of 5 µM in DPBS) for 30 min, placing the tube in a 37 °C water bath.\nResuspend the fragments by gently pipetting up and down every 10 min.\n\tNOTE: In case of CellTrace, add medium containing at least 1% protein at the end of the incubation, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min and discard the supernatant. Repeat this step 3x with 1 mL of DPBS to remove unincorporated dye.\nSuspend the fragments in 5 mL of DPBS in a 60 mm Petri dish.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that the tissue does not dry out.\n5. Establishment of zPDX\nNOTE: Perform the steps under a sterile tissue culture laminar flow hood.\nAnesthetize the 2 days post fertilization (dpf) embryos with 0.16 mg/mL tricaine in E3 zebrafish medium.\nPut three agarose cylinders (step 1.1.3) in a Petri dish and lay a zebrafish embryo on a cylinder, exposing one side. Remove the excess solution to keep the embryo in just a thin film.\nTransfer the piece of stained tissue with sterile forceps from the Petri dish to the 1% agarose support where the embryo is lying. Pick up the tissue, put it on top of the embryo yolk, and then push it into the perivitelline space using the heat-pulled glass microneedle (step 1.2.1).\nGently add some drops of E3 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Pen-Strep) to the embryo to bring it back into the liquid.",
    "Repeat steps 5.2-5.4 for all the embryos, and finally, remove the agarose supports from the Petri dish and incubate the embryos at 35 °C.\nCheck the embryos for the correct xenografts (positive staining) 2 h post implantation using a fluorescent stereomicroscope. Discard the embryos with tumor fragments that are not completely inside the perivitelline space, as well as the dead embryos. Randomly distribute the embryos in six multi-well plates (maximum n = 20 embryos/well), equally divided into groups according to the experimental plan (e.g., control and FOLFOXIRI).\n6. Treatment\nDilute the drug (e.g., 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan) into E3 1% Pen-Strep, mixing thoroughly by pipetting up and down several times. As proposed by Usai et al.12, use a fivefold dilution of the drug in the fish water, with respect to the equivalent plasma concentration (EPC).\nMix the drugs to prepare the cocktail (e.g., FOLFOXIRI).\nRemove the media from each well and add the drug cocktail 2 h after implantation.\nTreat the embryos for 3 days. Renew the drug cocktail every day.\n7. Whole-mount immunofluorescent staining\nNOTE: Before starting, place acetone at -20 °C and prepare the solutions listed in Table 1.\nDay 1:\n\t\nFix the larvae with 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in glass vials at 4 °C overnight.\nDay 2:\n\t\nWash the larvae 3 x 5 min with 1 mL of PBS, gently agitating on a laboratory platform rocker (400 rpm).\nStore in 1 mL of 100% methanol at -20 °C overnight (or for long-term storage).\nRehydrate 3 x 10 min with 1 mL of PTw (0.1% tween in PBS), gently agitating on a laboratory platform rocker (400 rpm).\nPermeabilize with 1 mL of 150 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.8 for 5 min at RT, followed by heating for 15 min at 70 °C.",
    "Wash 2 x 10 min with 1 mL of PTw, gently agitating on a laboratory platform rocker (400 rpm).\nWash 2 x 5 min with 1 mL of dH2O, gently agitating on a laboratory platform rocker (400 rpm).\nPermeabilize with 1 mL of ice-cold acetone for 20 min at -20 °C.\nWash 2 x 5 min with 1 mL of dH2O, gently agitating on a laboratory platform rocker (400 rpm).\nWash 2 x 5 min with 1 mL of PTw, gently agitating on a laboratory platform rocker (400 rpm).\nIncubate the larvae in 1 mL of blocking buffer for 3 h at 4 °C, gently agitating on a laboratory platform rocker (400 rpm).\nPlace the larvae in well plates divided per group as follows: 10 larvae in 50 µL of volume/well in a 96-well plate or 20 larvae in 100 µL of volume/well in a 48-well plate.\nDiscard the blocking buffer, incubate the larvae with primary antibody solution (e.g., rabbit anti-human cleaved caspase-3, 1:250) diluted in incubation buffer overnight at 4 °C in the dark, and gently rock on a shaker plate (400 rpm). See step 7.2.11 for recommended volumes.\nDay 3:\n\t\nWash the larvae sequentially 3 x 1 h with 1 mL of PBS-TS (10% goat serum, 1% Triton X-100 in PBS) and then, with 2 x 10 min with 1 mL of PBS-T (1% Triton X-100 in PBS) and 2 x 1 h with 1 mL of PBS-TS. In each wash, gently agitate the plates containing the larvae on a shaker plate (400 rpm).",
    "Incubate the larvae with fluorescent-dye conjugated secondary antibodies (e.g., Goat anti-Rabbit IgG [H+L] Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 647, 1:500) and 100 µg/mL Hoechst 33258 diluted in incubation buffer in the dark overnight at 4 °C, with gentle agitation on a shaker plate (400 rpm). See step 7.2.11 for recommended volumes of secondary antibody solution.\nDay 4:\n\t\nWash 3 x 1 h with 1 mL of PBS-TS and 2 x 1 h with 1 mL of PTw, with gentle agitation on a shaker plate (400 rpm).\nCreate a circular layer with the enamel (thickness of ~0.5-1 mm) on microscope slides. Let the enamel dry out and place the larvae in the center of the circular layer, exposing the side of the xenograft.\nDry the excess solution and mount the glass coverslip with a water-soluble, non-fluorescing mounting medium.\n8. Imaging\nCapture images under confocal microscopy with a 40x objective. Use the following acquisition parameters: a resolution of 1024 x 512 pixels with a Z-spacing of 5 µm.\n9. Analysis of apoptosis by ImageJ\nLoad (Fiji Is Just) ImageJ software (https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads) and open the Z-stack file image (click File | Open). In the pop-up window, select Stack viewing/Hyperstack and click OK.\nOverlay the different channels by selecting Image | Color | Make Composite.\nDrag the Z bar at the bottom of the image to browse through the Z-stack image and identify the xenograft area (cells that are fluorescent cell tracker positive. See step 4.5) in the zebrafish perivitelline space.\nSelect Point Tool and count the number of apoptotic human cells (positive to fluorescent cell tracker and cleaved caspase-3), as shown in Supplementary Video S1.\nDouble click on the Point Tool icon, change the counter, and count the total number of human cell nuclei (nuclei of CM-DiI positive cells).",
