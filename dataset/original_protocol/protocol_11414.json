    "This protocol focuses on using the non-transformed and chromosomally stable retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE-1) cell line for live-cell imaging experiments. However, this protocol can be adapted to any adherent cell line so long as cell culture conditions are adjusted as necessary. All procedures must adhere to institutional biosafety and ethical guidelines and regulations.\n1. Preparing Cells for Live-cell Imaging\nUse freshly thawed and early passage RPE-1 cells expressing either human histone H2B fused to a fluorescent protein (e.g. H2B-GFP), or the FUCCI system (a detailed protocol on how to generate FUCCI-expressing cells can be found in reference45) to assess mitotic cell fate.\nTo measure the frequency of nuclear rupture, use RPE-1 cells expressing both H2B-GFP and a tandem dimer of red fluorescent protein fused to a single nuclear localization signal (TDRFP-NLS).\n\t\tNOTE: Constructs of three green fluorescent proteins fused in tandem to a single nuclear localization signal (GFP3-NLS) have also been used to demonstrate rupture (as in reference42).\nMaintain cells on 10 cm tissue culture plates in the appropriate growth medium. RPE-1 cells are maintained in phenol red-free, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM:F12) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.\nAspirate medium from the cells, wash the tissue culture dish with 10 mL of sterile, room temperature phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove remaining medium, and then aspirate the PBS.\nAdd 2 mL of 0.25% Trypsin with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to the cells and incubate at 37 °C for 3 min or until the majority of cells have detached from the plate.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not keep cells in trypsin longer than needed.\nAdd 10 mL of complete medium to collect the trypsinized cells with a 10 mL serological stripette and dispense in a 15 mL conical tube.",
    "Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 180 x g for 3 min at room temperature.\nAspirate the supernatant, being careful not to disrupt the pellet, and then thoroughly resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of fresh medium by gently pipetting the medium up and down in the serological stripette.\nUse a hemocytometer or automated cell counting machine to count cells46.\nDilute cells in a new conical tube to 30,000 cells/mL of complete medium.\nPlate 30,000 RPE-1 cells (1 mL volume) per well of a 12-well glass bottomed (#1.5 thickness) imaging dish to achieve the required cellular density the next day (30–50% confluent).\n\t\tNOTE: Always handle the plate with gloves and be careful not to touch the glass-bottom.\nAllow cells to grow in a 37 °C tissue culture incubator until they fully attach and flatten on the glass-bottomed imaging plate. While cells can attach in as little as 4 h, it is recommended that cells are not treated with drugs and imaged until the following day.\nAdd paclitaxel (dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) to the desired final concentration in complete medium and mix thoroughly.\nPrepare complete medium with an equal volume of DMSO alone to use as a control.\nWarm the medium containing drug or DMSO to 37 °C before adding to cells. This will prevent focal drift due to a sudden temperature change.\nAdd 1 mL of medium containing either paclitaxel or DMSO alone to individual wells of the 12-well imaging dish.\n2. Setting Up the Microscope for Live-cell Imaging\nClean the glass-bottom of the imaging dish with optical cleaner to remove any fingerprints or dust that may interfere with imaging. Use sufficient optical cleaner to wet the entire glass surface.",
    "Place the glass-bottom dish on the microscope stage in the imaging dish adaptor, remove the plastic cover from the dish, and cover the dish with a glass-topped chamber. Ensure the chamber has a valve to allow a steady flow of air consisting of 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: To humidify the 5% CO2, the gas is flowed through tubing inserted into a sterile water bath housing. This allows for the gas to become equilibrated to 95% humidity.\nInitiate/calibrate the encoded stage using the software program controlling the microscope. This will ensure accurate X-Y coordinates and prevent focal drift.\nFocus on the cells using phase-contrast optics and perform Kohler illumination (described in detail in reference47) to focus the light and provide optimal contrast.\nUse acquisition software to determine the optimal exposure times for white light and all fluorescent channels being used (exposures that give 75% pixel saturation on the camera are ideal, provided this amount of light is not toxic to cells).\nUse acquisition software to select several, non-overlapping fields of view from each well for imaging. Select imaging regions where cells have adhered well to the glass-bottom and are between 50% and 70% confluent. Avoid areas of clumped cells, as this will make subsequent analysis difficult.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to have non-overlapping fields of view from each well to avoid tracking the same cells twice. If cells are highly motile, it may be necessary to acquire several images radiating out from a central point and stitch them back together to make one large field of view.\nActivate the microscope's autofocusing feature to ensure all points are maintained in focus for the duration of the experiment.",
    "To assess mitotic cell fate, set the imaging software to collect images from each selected field of view every 10 min for up to 96 h. Unperturbed mitosis lasts 20–40 min, and thus 10 min intervals will provide enough sampling to identify when cells divide. To identify nuclear rupture, which is a transient event, acquire images every 5 min.\n\tNOTE: Make sure that the computer driving the image acquisition software has auto-updating, screensavers, and energy-savings modes disabled, as these can often interfere with image acquisition over long experiments.\nInitiate the imaging experiment. Periodically confirm that image acquisition is running smoothly over the course of the video.\n3. Video Analysis to Identify Cell Fate in Response to Paclitaxel\nConfirm that imaged cells are healthy throughout the course of the imaging experiment. Control cells treated with DMSO should be viable and actively proliferating.\n\tNOTE: If cells exhibit signs of stress, do not quantitate the video and instead focus on optimizing imaging conditions48. Signs of imaging stress include blebbing/dying cells, cells that fail to attach/spread on the plate, and cells that show a low mitotic index and/or prolonged mitosis. Possible sources of stress include fluctuations in temperature or CO2 levels inside the imaging chamber or phototoxicity48.\nWhen imaging an entire field of view with a 10X or 20X objective, hundreds of individual cells may be present. Therefore, to assist with quantitation, divide the field of view into smaller quadrants using available software tools. Score cells within each quadrant separately (as described in steps 3.3.1–3.6.2).\nWhen analyzing the video, track each cell in a merged view using phase-contrast and/or fluorescent images. Use software analysis tools to create the merged view.",
    "Starting at the beginning of the video, identify a single interphase cell and track its progress through the cell cycle using phase optics. To track a single cell, observe the cell from frame to frame by eye. Identify interphase cells due to their flattened morphology (as assessed by phase-contrast) and their lack of DNA condensation (as assessed by H2B-GFP) (Figure 1A).\nIdentify cells that enter mitosis by observation of cell rounding (using phase-contrast optics) and/or chromosome condensation (using H2B-GFP) (Figure 1A-C). Both cell rounding and chromosome condensation are readily visualized by eye.\nAnnotate the time when the cell enters mitosis. Continue tracking the cell until it reaches its fate (anaphase as in step 3.5, cell death from mitosis as in step 3.6.1, or mitotic slippage as in step 3.6.2).\nControl cells should efficiently align their chromosomes and enter anaphase within 1 h (Figure 1D). Visualize anaphase by phase-contrast optics as the cell begins to pinch into two or through visualization of poleward-moving chromosomes labeled with H2B-GFP (Figure 1A). Annotate the time when the cell undergoes anaphase.\nBy contrast, cells treated with paclitaxel will remain rounded with condensed chromosomes for several hours (3-40 h) (Figure 1B-D).\nIdentify mitotically-arrested cells that undergo cell death.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells that die during mitosis are visualized by phase-contrast microscopy, as cells will bleb, shrink, and/or rupture (Figure 1B). If imaging H2B-GFP, the chromosomes will also fragment during cell death.\nIdentify mitotically-arrested cells that undergo cell slippage.\n\t\tNOTE: Cells that undergo mitotic slippage are observed by phase-contrast microscopy, as they flatten back out into interphase and decondense chromosomes without undergoing anaphase (Figure 1C). Cells that undergo mitotic slippage give rise to large tetraploid cells that are often multinucleated (Figure 1C).",
    "Continue tracking cells from the original field of view. Once a whole field of view is tracked, move to a separate field of view acquired from the same well and continue tracking cells.\n4. Video Analysis to Identify Cell Fate Following Mitotic Slippage\nAssess cell fate following mitotic slippage (as described in step 3.6.2) using RPE-1 cells expressing the FUCCI system. In addition to phase-contrast imaging, it is necessary to acquire both red fluorescence (indicative of G1 phase) and green fluorescence (indicative of S/G2/M) images).\nTrack FUCCI RPE-1 cells as described in step 3.3 through 3.7.\n\t\t\nTo confirm that the FUCCI system is working properly, validate that control cells alternate expression of the red and green fluorescent proteins appropriately from analysis of the live-cell imaging data. Control cells should transition from exhibiting entirely nuclear red fluorescence to exhibiting entirely nuclear green fluorescence during interphase as cells progress from G1 to S phase. Cells should continue exhibiting green fluorescence throughout the completion of mitosis. Immediately following mitosis, cells should once again exhibit entirely red fluorescence during interphase.\n\t\t\tNOTE: While methods exist to quantify both RFP and GFP fluorescence intensities from the FUCCI system in single cells using fluorescent traces49, this is often not necessary as the fluorescence color change is robust and visible by eye.\nIdentify cells arrested in mitosis using phase-contrast microscopy and track them until they undergo mitotic slippage, as described in 3.4 and 3.6.2. Cells that slip out of mitosis and back into interphase will change from exhibiting green fluorescence during mitosis to red fluorescence during G1 phase (Figure 2A-C).\nTrack these slipped cells using phase-contrast and epifluorescent imaging by eye to assess their cell fate (Figure 2D).",
    "Identify cells that re-enter the cell cycle. These cells are identified by the red-to-green change in fluorescence expression using the FUCCI system that indicates G1/S transition (Figure 2A).\nIdentify cells that undergo G1 cell cycle arrest. These cells are identified by expression of red fluorescence that persists for >24 h (Figure 2B).\nIdentify cells that die in interphase. These cells are identified by cell rupture/blebbing/shrinking using phase-contrast imaging (Figure 2C).\n5. Video Analysis to Identify Frequency of Nuclear Envelope Rupture\nUse RPE-1 cells expressing H2B-GFP and TDRFP-NLS to assess nuclear envelope rupture. In addition to phase-contrast imaging, acquire both red fluorescence (TRITC) and green fluorescence (FITC) images. Acquire images every 5 min to visualize rupture.\n\tNOTE: It is critical to generate cell lines in which the TDRFP-NLS is efficiently imported into the nucleus with minimal cytoplasmic fluorescence.\nImage cells as described in step 3.3 through 3.4. The TDRFP-NLS fluorescence signal and H2B-GFP should co-localize during interphase. Upon mitosis (as visualized by cell rounding using phase optics and/or chromosome condensation by H2B-GFP), the nuclear envelope will break down and the TDRFP-NLS signal will become cytoplasmic (Figure 3A). Following mitosis, the nuclear envelope will reform in the daughter cells and the TDRFP-NLS signal will become nuclear.\nTrack daughter cells throughout the subsequent interphase by live-cell imaging. Identify nuclear rupture events by observing a transient burst of nuclear-localized TDRFP-NLS into the surrounding cytoplasm. Within minutes, the nuclear envelope will be repaired and the TDRFP-NLS will be relocalized to the nucleus (Figure 3A).\n\tNOTE: Often, the nuclear DNA, as visualized by H2B-GFP, will be seen to protrude outside the rupture site as a small bleb.",
    "Score the fraction of nuclei that undergo a rupture event during interphase. To score this fraction, count the number of cells that undergo a rupture event over the total number of cells tracked.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
