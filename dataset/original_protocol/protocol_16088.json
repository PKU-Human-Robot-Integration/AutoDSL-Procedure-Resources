    "Materials\n∼100 g male or female rats, aged ∼5-6 weeks (e.g., Wistar or Wistar-Kyoto)\n∼1% (w/v) sucrose solution\nDrug(s) to be tested and the appropriate vehicle. Experiments typically also include either venlafaxine or escitalopram as a reference compound.\nNon-transparent plastic home cages (55 × 35 × 20 cm for grouped housing and 40 × 25 × 15 cm for single housing)\nSound-proof housing rooms with stable environmental conditions (i.e., light/dark cycle, temperature, and humidity, air exchange rate not higher than 6 per hour)\n300-ml polyethylene drinking bottles with bungs and stainless-steel spouts containing a ball-bearing to minimize spillage (e.g., North Kent Plastic Cages)\nDue to differences in reactivity to stressful stimuli, other rat strains (e.g., Long-Evans or Sprague-Dawley) are not recommended.\nThe exact concentration of the sucrose solution can vary between 1% and 2%, depending on the conditions in individual laboratories. The typical sucrose concentration is 1%, and at this concentration, normal non-stressed animals should drink 12 to 18 g of solution per day. The concentration can be increased if they drink less, but the final concentration should not exceed 2%.\nAdaptation to laboratory conditions and sucrose consumption\n1. After arrival at the laboratory, allow the animals to adapt to environmental conditions for approximately 3 weeks. The number of animals to be ordered will depend on the experimental design but typically should be 8 to 10 animals per treatment group, plus several extras in case of attrition (see below).",
    "During the first 10 days, keep the animals in groups of 10 (in bigger cages of 55 × 35 × 20 cm to avoid overcrowding) and then house them singly (in smaller cages of 40 × 25 × 15 cm). This adaptation period can be prolonged depending on the animals’ weight. At the end of this phase, the animals should weigh ∼200 g.\nSucrose consumption studies\n2. Deprive the animals of food and water beginning the evening prior to measuring sucrose consumption at around 18.00 hr.\n3. On the morning of the test day, prepare a fresh sucrose solution (final temperature ∼22°C, so not directly from the cold tap), fill the drinking bottles with ∼200 ml of the solution, weigh them, and place them in the cages.\n4. Allow the rats to consume the sucrose solution for 1 hr.\n5. Remove the bottles, reweigh them, and calculate intake as the difference in weight before and after the test.\n6. Carefully wash the bottles and bungs with spouts using warm tap water without detergents.\n7. Following the test, allow an interval of at least 1 hr and then return food and water.\n8. Repeat steps 2-7 once per week for 7-8 weeks, by which time sucrose intake should have stabilized.\n9. On the day following the final baseline test, divide the animals semi-randomly into control and “to-be-stressed” groups (ensuring that mean sucrose intakes are closely matched), move both groups to separate rooms, and start the stress procedure.",
    "In a typical experiment, the mean consumption of sucrose solution in the final baseline test can range from 12 to 14 g. Based on these values, balance the groups with regard to the number of high (>15 g), medium (11-15 g), and low (<11 g) drinkers, so the average value for the two groups is roughly equal.\nIt is recommended that very low and very high drinkers (i.e., animals that consume substantially less and/or more than the mean values for consumption in the last 2-3 baseline tests) and unstable drinkers are excluded from further stages of the procedure. In a typical experiment, up to 15% of the animals are excluded in this baseline stage.\nIncluding up to 15% more animals in the “to-be-stressed” group is also recommended to account for further drop-outs during the chronic stress protocol. An approximate 30% loss of animals should be considered when planning the study and ordering animals.\nMake sure that all the rooms have stable and comparable environmental conditions and that they are effectively separated from each other to avoid the behavior, odor, and sound of one group influencing the other. Do not house other animals in these rooms throughout the experiment, and ensure the rooms are not overcrowded.\nStressor application\n10. Subject rats of the stressed group (n = 9-12 initially) to the stress procedure using a selection of stressors listed in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.712#cpz1712-tbl-0001]. A typical sequence of stressors used in our Laboratory is presented in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.712#cpz1712-tbl-0002].\nTable 1.\n                Selection of Stressors\ntable:\n﻿Stressor,Description\nFood and water deprivation,\"Use separate periods of food deprivation or water deprivation, and one period of both food and water deprivation. This last stressor precedes each sucrose test.\"",
    "Cage tilting,\"Tilt the cages backward (∼45°). This stressor should follow periods of food or water deprivation; when the animals are hungry or thirsty, tilting the cages makes access to food or water more difficult. This is usually achieved by tilting individual cages or a whole rack of cages, with measures to ensure they remain secure and do not fall.\"\nGrouped housing,\"Place two animals into one cage, randomly changing the partners (same sex, and using animals from the stressed group, not additional animals from outside the experiment). This powerful stressor is particularly effective if applied at night and after a period of water deprivation.\"\nSoiled cage,Pour 250 ml plain water into the sawdust bedding.\nStroboscopic illumination,Use low intensity ∼120 flashes/min. Do not forget to switch off the room lights when this stressor is used.\nIntermittent illumination,Switch the room lights on and off every ∼2 hr.\nNo stress,An unexpected lack of stress is also a stressful stimulus for animals undergoing continuous stress.\nTable 2.\n                Stressor Weekly Schedule\ntable:\n﻿Time,Stressor\nMonday morning,Cage cleaning followed by no stress\nMonday evening,Food and water deprivation\nTuesday morning (10.00 AM),Sucrose test followed by the return of food and water at ∼12.00 PM\nTuesday evening,Cage tilting\nWednesday morning,Strobe\nWednesday evening,No stress\nThursday morning,Intermittent illumination\nThursday evening,Water or food deprivation\nFriday morning,Grouped housing\nFriday evening,Strobe\nSaturday morning,Food or water deprivation\nSaturday evening,Cage tilting\nSunday morning,Cage tilting continued\nSunday evening,Soiled cage\n11. Apply the stressors to single rats in their home cages continuously (i.e., throughout the day and night) and individually (i.e., one stressor at a time).\nProvide food and water ad libitum to the control non-stressed animals, except for the overnight period of deprivation preceding each sucrose test.",
    "To avoid impinging on the consummatory behavior of stressed animals, no stress should be given before the food and water deprivation period preceding each sucrose test. Each stressor is applied for a period of 10-14 hr in a schedule that lasts for a full week and is then repeated.\nThe amount and intensity of stress should be comparable within and between experiments.\n12. Continue the stress procedure and weekly sucrose tests until the consumption of sucrose solution by the stressed animals falls below their intakes in the final baseline test by approximately 40% to 60% (i.e., from 12-14 g to 6-8 g). (Intakes should be comparable across groups at baseline and week 3 of stress within an experiment but may vary between experiments.)\nIn the majority of studies, such an effect occurs gradually, usually requiring 2 to 3 weeks of stress before the intakes significantly differ from the baseline scores in stressed animals and the intakes of unstressed control subjects.\nTest compound administration\n13. Based on the sucrose intake following at least 2 weeks of initial stress, divide the animals further into matched treatment groups and begin administration of the test compounds and reference drugs.\nEach treatment group should consist of 8 to 10 animals. The groups should be balanced with regard to high, medium, and low drinkers (see above), and each of the control and stressed groups should have roughly the same average sucrose consumption across treatment groups (see above).\n14. Administer a reference drug (e.g., venlafaxine or escitalopram, both at 10 mg/kg/day, IP), vehicle (e.g., sterile saline 1 ml/kg/day, IP), and test compounds with appropriate vehicles.",
    "Drugs should be given to the control and stressed animals at a fixed time of day (e.g., at 10.00 with a second administration in the case of b.i.d. regimens at 17.00). On the test day, the drugs should be administered after the return of water.\n15. Continue weekly sucrose tests on all animals (i.e., vehicle- and drug/compound-treated control and stressed animals).\nTo avoid the nonspecific effects of a test compound on thirst motivation, and to evaluate the chronic effect of compound administration, not an effect of the last dose, conduct the sucrose tests ∼24 hr after the final administration of the compound. In other words, it is recommended that no compound is administered immediately before the sucrose test. In the b.i.d. regimen, the second treatment on the preceding day should be omitted.\n16. Continue the stress procedure, weekly sucrose tests, and daily treatments until the decrease in the consumption of sucrose in stressed animals is restored to the level of the pre-stress and/or vehicle-treated control group.\nFor most of the effective drugs and compounds tested in the model, five weeks of administration is sufficient to see a full recovery from the stress-induced deficit in sucrose consumption.\nThe CMS procedure can also be used to evaluate the rapid action of the drugs and compounds. For this purpose, tested drugs and compounds are administered at single doses the day before the final sucrose test.\nSeveral options can be used as subsequent endpoints of the CMS study:\n         \nsucrose tests can be continued for 1 to 4 weeks to see how long the effects are sustained after cessation of the treatments.",
    "a battery of behavioral tests (e.g., Elevated Plus Maze, Novel Object Recognition, Social Interaction) can be conducted to evaluate the effects of a tested compound on stress-induced anxiety and cognitive and social deficits (Papp et al., 2017a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.712#cpz1712-bib-0032], 2017b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.712#cpz1712-bib-0033], 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.712#cpz1712-bib-0034], 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.712#cpz1712-bib-0035], 2023[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.712#cpz1712-bib-0037]; Willner et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.712#cpz1712-bib-0046]).\n17. Analyze the sucrose test results using a three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by a standard test (e.g., Newman-Keuls or Bonferroni test) for post-hoc comparisons of means.\nIf specific predictions are being tested, planned comparisons could be made using t-tests based on the estimated means and the pooled standard deviation derived from the ANOVA. The analysis of sucrose intake should include two between-subjects factors (stress/control and drug treatments) and one within-subjects factor (successive sucrose tests). Two-way ANOVA should be used for one-off endpoints (e.g., The NORT or biochemical assays)."
