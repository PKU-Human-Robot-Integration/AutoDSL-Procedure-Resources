  "procedures": [
    "All procedures described here were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of The University of Minnesota, and are in accordance with The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals13.\n1. Animals and Cannulation Surgery\nObtain Syrian hamsters from a common animal supplier at approximately 55 days of age.\n\tNOTE: Although the age of animals will vary due to constraints of various experimental paradigms, for sexual behavior it is important to obtain sexually mature animals that are all approximately the same age.\nHouse animals in a controlled temperature (22 °C) and lighting (14 h light followed by 10 h dark with lights out at 13:00 h) environment, with food and water available ad libitum except during periods of experimental testing.\n\tNOTE: Since hamsters seasonally reproduce, this 14:10 light/dark cycle mimics their natural breeding conditions.\nFollowing a 1-week acclimation to the laboratory, perform aseptic bilateral ovariectomies and intracranial stereotaxic cannulations under general anesthesia (e.g., pentobarbital), and administer appropriate institutionally-approved post-operative analgesic and antibiotic treatment as previously described14,15.\n\tNOTE: For the study of sexual behavior, ovariectomies are necessary to remove the major endogenous source of sexual hormones so that the animals can be uniformly induced to sexual receptivity with exogenous hormone in accordance with the experimental timeline.\n\t\nFor both dopaminergic and glutamatergic probe implantation, stereotaxically implant guide cannulae (0.7 mm diameter; Figure 3) into the area of interest (e.g., this lab targeted the right nucleus accumbens (NAc)) as described in stepwise detail elsewhere15.\n\t\tNOTE: Although the data presented are from single sensor recordings of one glutamate or dopamine probe per animal, this system allows for simultaneous recording of up to 4 sensors in a single animal; thus, 1 - 4 cannulae could be implanted depending on desired experimental design and outcomes.",
    "Determine the implant coordinates of the region of interest using a stereotaxic atlas (e.g., The Golden Hamster Brain by Morin & Wood), keeping in mind that the sensor extends 1 mm below the cannula into brain tissue.\nAfter a cannula is stereotaxically lowered to the desired dorsal-ventral location, affix it to the skull using a cap constructed from dental acrylic, secured with stainless steel bone screws and a plastic head mount (Figure 3; see15 for more details).\nFor carbon fiber testing, insert a reference electrode (350 μm diameter, 7.5 mm total length) into the contralateral hemisphere.\n\t\tNOTE: A specific location or distance from the cannula is not required; reference electrodes may be placed anywhere in the contralateral hemisphere that is convenient.\n2. Biosensor and Carbon Fiber Testing\nFollowing 1-week of recovery from surgery, administer the hormone priming regimen to induce sexual receptivity.\n\t\nInject 10 µg of estradiol benzoate in 0.1 mL of cottonseed oil subcutaneously (s.c.), approximately 48 h and 24 h prior to the sexual behavior testing, to induce sexual receptivity towards the male11.\nInject 500 µg of progesterone in 0.1 mL of cottonseed oil, s.c., 4 h prior to the introduction of the male to induce sexual receptivity11.\nTest all animals at the start of the dark phase of their daily cycle, as social behaviors of rodents are subject to alteration under white light and red light testing conditions16,17,18.\nFor enzymatic biosensor glutamate testing, calibrate the sensors in vitro (Figure 4) before use as described previously15,19.\n\t\nMake the calibration solutions fresh on the day of testing in 20 mL glass centrifuge tubes. For the analyte solution, dissolve 7.4 mg of L-glutamic acid into 10 mL of ultra-pure H2O by gently inverting the tube. Make the interferent solution by dissolving 176.1 mg AA in 10 mL of ultra-pure H2O.",
    "Set up for the calibration by placing a magnetic stirrer on the base of a basic lab ring stand. Place a 20-mL jacketed beaker on top of the magnetic stirrer, and clamp in place using a medium 2-prong clamp.\n\t\t\nAdd a magnetic stir bar and 20 mL of 100 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS) into the jacketed beaker. Connect the jacketed beaker to a circulating water bath to heat the buffer solution to 37 °C.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The enzymatic biosensor calibrations must be performed at body temperature since enzymatic activity is influenced by temperature.\nPlace the sensor calibration holder on top of the jacketed beaker, and set a 4-channel calibration preamplifier on top, securing in place using a right-angle clamp. Connect the preamplifier to a data conditioning and acquisition device to record calibration data.\nTest the sensitivity of each enzymatic biosensor to glutamate (or other analytes of interest for other commercially available biosensor probes e.g., glucose) before the experimental recording by placing the probe into the calibration holder atop a jacketed beaker, submerging the sensing cavity and some portion of the silver chloride (AgCl) reference wire in the buffer solution.\n\t\t\nBefore connecting each sensor (up to 4) being tested to a port on a 4-channel calibration preamplifier, initiate a new recording on the computer interface utilizing free downloadable acquisition software. Allow the sensors to reach a stable baseline.\nBegin adding the analyte injections when the sensors have reached a stable baseline. Use the hole in the calibration holder to introduce a pipette tip to the buffer solution. Use the quick key annotation tool in the recording software to annotate when an injection is made.",
    "Make 10 µM additions of glutamate by pipetting 40 μL of the analyte solution into the buffer solution. Wait for the sensor to stabilize between additions. Add 3 injections of analyte solution before adding a single injection from interferent AA solution (50 μL injection volume for 250 μM change in concentration).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The calibration allows for conversion of the changes in the amperometric signal (seen during the enzymatic experimental recording in step 2.12) to changes in glutamate concentration, if desired. See reference15 for stepwise instruction. The dopaminergic probes used by this lab are calibrated during the manufacturing process by the commercial provider. Glutamate probes must be calibrated at the time of use as their sensitivity can decrease over time as the enzymatic components degrade19. Because carbon fiber electrodes do not undergo degradation, the calibration performed by the company prior to shipment is sufficient along as there is an increased likelihood of damaging the thin carbon fiber (350 μm diameter) through additional handling.\nLine the test chamber with bedding taken from the animal's home cage.\n\tNOTE: This increases the female's familiarity with the testing chamber, as well as exposes the male to sexually stimulating olfactory mating cues that were distributed by the female in response to the estradiol treatment.\nLightly anesthetize the animals prior to insertion of the probe by either isoflurane or another volatile anesthetic in an induction chamber.\nRemove the occlusive obdurator from the guide cannula, and insert either the carbon fiber electrode or enzymatic probe through the guide shaft.\nAfter the probe insertion, place the animal in the testing chamber.\n\tNOTE: This lab uses a 10-gal glass aquarium (24.5 x 48.9 x 29.4 cm), but round chambers of equal area may also be employed.",
    "Begin recording the video and time-locked amperometric signal in a commercially available software program, described in detail elsewhere15.\nConnect the sensor to the recording system: the potentiostat via an electrically shielded cable and an electrical swivel. Stabilize the sensor connection by screwing a pin attachment onto the head mount. Reinforce the connection using lab film if necessary.\n\tNOTE: A customized connector is needed to attach both the carbon fiber electrode and reference electrode to the potentiostat, while the enzymatic glutamate sensors can be directly connected to the potentiostat.\nAllow the sensor to equilibrate in the brain before experimental testing.\n\tNOTE: Equilibration times differ depending on the recording sensor (e.g., enzymatic sensors require 2 - 4 h equilibration, while carbon-fiber electrodes only require about 30 min). If both types of sensors are implanted, equilibrate for the longer enzymatic sensor time.\nAfter sensor equilibration, introduce a stimulus male into the testing chamber.\nFollowing the first mount with penile insertion (termed intromission) by the stimulus male, continue recording for an additional 10 - 30 min, depending on the experimental goals.\nFollowing behavioral testing, disconnect the female's sensor.\nRemove both hamsters from the testing chamber. Remove the bedding and clean the chamber using 70% ethanol.\n\tNOTE: Due to the brief equilibration required for carbon fiber recordings, steps 2.3 - 2.14 can be repeated to test multiple animals in the same day. In contrast, because the enzymatic sensors require about 4 h of equilibration, test only one animal per day to limit possible inter-subject variation due to differences in the animals' circadian time at testing.\n3. Sacrifice and Perfusion\nFollowing the conclusion of the testing period, deeply anesthetize the female test subject with a euthanizing agent (e.g., this lab uses an intraperitoneal injection of 0.2 mL phenytoin and pentobarbital solution).",
    "Transcardially perfuse the animal with 25 mM PBS, pH 7.6, to remove all circulating blood, followed by a 20 min fixation using 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS.\nRemove the brain and postfix in ~ 30 mL of the 4% paraformaldehyde solution in a 50-mL conical tube overnight.\n\t\nStore the brain in a 10% sucrose-PBS solution until ready to serial section.\n\t\tNOTE: Brains may be stored up to 2-weeks, with weekly sucrose solution changes to avoid potential growth of contaminants.\nSerial section the brain in 40 µm slices through the implanted region with either a freezing microtome or cryostat as previously described19.\nMount slices serially on commercially available adhesive-coated slides (or see20 to make). Allow to dry, at least overnight.\nStain the slides with cresyl violet dye, clear, and coverslip as previously described20.\nImage the slides using bright field microscopy to confirm the anatomical placement of the sensor.\n4. Behavioral Coding\nView and annotate the videos using free commercially downloadable software (see Table of Materials) in slow motion to precisely code behaviors time-locked to the amperometric signal.\n\tNOTE: To use the MATLAB code in the analysis (see below), annotate the start and end of each of the female's and male's behaviors.\n\t\nAnnotate startLordosis in the frame when the female initiates a dorsoflexion of her back and defects her tail upwards. Annotate endLordosis when the female terminates this posture, which often occurs when the female readjusts to another location in the testing chamber.\nAnnotate startAI when the female is in the lordosis posture and the male moves his snout towards the female's anogenital region, where sniffing, licking, or nuzzling of her perineal region may occur. Annotate endAI when the male removes his snout from close proximity to the female's anogenital region.",
    "Annotate startMount when the male approaches and places his forepaws on the female in a mounting posture, regardless of the orientation of the mount attempt (e.g., side, rump).\nAnnotate startIntromission when successful thrusting gains the mounted male penile access to the female's vagina.\n\t\tNOTE: An intromission is behaviorally distinguishable from the mounted thrusting that occurs prior to intromission, as the male visibly pulls his upper limbs towards his body, thrusts his pelvis forward, and curls his tail upwards, indicating penetration (see Figure 4C).\n\t\t\nWhen applicable, annotate ejaculation.\n\t\t\tNOTE: At the end of a mating bout and in conjunction with a successful intromission, the male will ejaculate. Although one is unable to visualize the actual emission, male hamsters have a characteristic treading motion with their hind foot during an intromission21, thus annotate the ejaculation at the occurrence of the foot movement.\nAnnotate endIntromission and endMount simultaneously in the frame when the male has removed his front two paws and thus, has no contact with the female. Due to the frequent inability to visualize his withdrawal, simultaneous code these two behaviors to allow for consistency and reliability across mating bouts.\n\t\tNote: A mating bout either follows a successful ejaculation or is when the female breaks the lordosis posture following at least one mount.\n5. Example Data Analysis\nNote: The use of fixed-potential carbon fiber and enzymatic recordings for dopamine and glutamate, respectively, allows for the ability to measure both tonic and phasic patterns of electrochemical release. This lab uses a free, commercial acquisition system and software to record and convert recorded signals from analog to digital (bias 0.600 V, sampling rate = 1 Hz).\nDescription of example data analysis protocol\nAlthough other programs can be used, quantify the tonic and phasic (transient) changes in the recorded electrochemical signal using MATLAB.",
    "For the presented data, calculate the tonic signal using a 50-point moving average filter. A transient-only normalized representation of the signal was calculated by subtracting the tonic signal from the raw data. When identifying phasic peaks, there are various algorithmic options (e.g., labeling peaks as changes in the signal more than 1 SD above the mean).\nIdentify the locations of these peaks, i.e., local maxima, from the normalized signal using the MATLAB function peakfinder with the minimum peak amplitude set to the root mean square of the signal. The location of peaks detected from the normalized signal was used to extract the amplitude from each peak. The ability to detect peaks allows for the identification of any time-locked behaviors that may be coinciding with, or driving the relative peak in the neurochemical under investigation.\nSegment the processed data in accordance with the behavioral annotations (see step 3); a Student's t-test was used to evaluate differences in the tonic neurotransmitter level, the occurrence of transients, and the amplitude of transients during the pre-mating bout lordosis versus lordosis during mating bouts. To measure changes to tonic patterns of electrochemical release, the data points occurring during the Lordosis position directly before a mating bout (i.e., pre-mating bout lordosis) were compared to the data points during a mating bout session using a t-test.\nPreparation of raw data for described data analysis protocol\n\tNote: As stated, although other programs or analyses may be equally viable options, in order to use the MATLAB code described above, the raw data must be prepared in the following way:",
    "Export the annotation and voltage files. To do this, under the 'File' tab, select the 'Export' function and select the 'Annotations' tab to save the annotations. Under the 'File' tab, select the 'Export' function and choose the \"TSV' tab to save the voltage measurements as a TSV extension file.\nOpen each file with a spreadsheet program and save as 'xls/xlsx' to make the files compatible with MATLAB.\n\t\tNOTE: For the 'Annotation' file, there are additional annotations that must manually added post-export in a spreadsheet program to dictate the start and end of both the pre-mating bout lordosis (annotated as PreMBlordorsis) and the mating bout so that these time points can be directly compared as mentioned in step 5.1.2.\nAnnotate the start of the pre-mating bout lordosis (startPreMBlordosis) at the same time as a lordosis behavior begins (startLordosis) that also includes a mount behavior, and also at the start of a new mating bout if the female remains in the lordosis posture.\nAnnotate the end of the pre-mating bout lordosis (endPreMBlordosis) when the first mount begins.\nAnnotate the start of a mating bout (startMB) at the same time of the endPreMBlordosis, as this signifies the start of a mating bout.\nAnnotate the end of a mating bout (endMB) at either the end of a mount that includes an ejaculation (see step 4.1.4.1), or following the female's termination of the lordosis posture (endLordosis).\nSubscription Required.
