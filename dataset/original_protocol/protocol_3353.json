    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEstrous cycle staging\nTiming: 2.5 h\nThis step allows the investigator to determine the estrous cycle stage of the experimental mouse.\nOn the day of experiment, collect vaginal lavage (VL) for cycle stage determination.\nNote: We recommend using a p200 micropipette.\nAlternatives: Administer diethylstilbesterol 0.2 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 24 h or medroxyprogesterone 17-acetate 10 mg/kg subcutaneously 24–48 h before euthanization, to bring all mice to the estrus or diestrus stages respectively.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nPipet 200 μL of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and flush the mouse vagina 3 times, and place lavage in a labeled vial.\nCritical: For terminal harvests, the depth (or size) of the pipette tip may not be a major concern. However, if VL is required in non-terminal harvests, cautiously insert the pipette tip and flush gently to prevent pseudopregnancy.\nMount cells on slides:\nPlace VL (50–100 μL) from each mouse on clean labeled microscope slides.\nAllow slides to air-dry at room temperature.\nFix the dried slides with cold 100% methanol and allow to air-dry (Slides are ready to be stained when the methanol is completely dry).\nStain slides with 0.01% methylene blue.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] Place the methylene blue solution up to ¾ of a Coplin staining jar.\nInsert slides (up to 3 at a time) into the methylene blue solution for 1 min.\nRemove slides from the methylene blue solution and place in Coplin jar containing up to ¾ of distilled or deionized water for 0.5–1 min.\nRemove slides from water, place on a clean dry surface, and wipe off excess water from the edges of the slides using Kimwipes.\nAir-dry and view.",
    "Note: The air-drying stage at 3b can take up to 2 h or more depending on the room humidity. If working in a humid environment, place slides over a heated oven or in an oven at low heat (27°C–30°C) and monitored until dry to prevent destruction of cells.\nProcess the ovaries while the cells air-dry. We advise withdrawing up to 200 μL of lavage (in excess of what is required (50–100 μL) in case of spillage or loss of lavage from the slide due to handling.\nCritical: Ovarian cell numbers (immune and non-immune cells) are affected by cycle stage, existing pathologies, and ovary size.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] Thus, it is essential to know the cycle stage of the mouse for accurate data interpretation.\nDetermination of estrous cycle stages (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nView slides under a microscope (we used the Nikon Eclipse E600, USA).\nView slides at a lower magnification first (×4 or ×10) to get a bird’s eye view of the slide (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3119-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Murine estrous cycle stages\n(A and B) Initial and focused view of slide at ×10 and ×20 magnification respectively. (B) Vaginal cytology showing stages of the estrous cycle: proestrus and estrus stages (top panel), and metestrus and diestrus stages (bottom panel). N = nucleated epithelial cells; C = cornified epithelial cells; L = leukocytes. Scale bars are indicated in each image.\nFocus on an area of the slide that best represents the cell distribution (×20 magnification is recommended) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nView or take images. The cell distribution will allow the investigator to determine the mouse estrous cycle stage.\nDetermine proestrus stage by the dominant presence of nucleated epithelial cells punctuated with cornified epithelial and leukocytic cells8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nIdentify estrus stage by the dominant presence of anucleated cornified epithelial cells8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Identify metestrus stage by the presence of a fairly even mixed combination of leukocytic cells, nucleated epithelial cells, and cornified epithelial cells8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nDetermine diestrus stage by the dominant presence of leukocytic cells8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8],9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: The murine estrous cycle is broadly subdivided into four phases: proestrus, estrus, metestrus and diestrus.\nCritical: View the slides at a lower magnification (Step 4a, Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A top panel) initially to observe cell distribution across the slide.\nMouse ovary (and spleen) harvest\nTiming: 0.5 h/mouse\nThis section details steps to identify and harvest the mouse ovary and spleen.\nTerminally anesthetize the mouse under isoflurane anesthesia and euthanize by cervical dislocation.\nIsolate the ovary and spleen.\nSpray 70% ethanol on the abdominal region.\nCarefully open the abdomen and expose the abdominal cavity with fine scissors (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), identify the spleen (located under the ribcage and has a distinct dark red color) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3119-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Identification of mouse ovary and spleen tissues\n(A) Dissect and expose the abdominal cavity.\n(B) The spleen is located under the rib cage in the peritoneal cavity, on the left side of the dorsal position.\n(C) Move out the intestines (or gastrointestinal tract) and abdominal fat to locate the ovary which sits on top of the oviduct and uterus.\n(D) A closer view of the isolated reproductive tract and ovary.\n(E) The isolated mouse ovary. The scale bar is as indicated within the image.\nHarvest the spleen, and place immediately in cold medium (RPMI + 20% FBS).\nGently push aside the intestines with forceps to reveal the reproductive tract underneath (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D).\nOnce the ovary is identified, carefully dissect the ovary from both uterine horns (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E) and place immediately in a Petri dish containing cold media (RPMI + 20% FBS).",
    "Rapidly but gently remove adhering fat and mesenteries (if any).\nLightly place the ovaries on an adsorbent pad to remove excess fluid, remove from the pad, and weigh.\nAlternatives: For non-terminal experiments, the ovaries can be isolated from an anesthetized mouse in the prone position which will minimize interference with the other organs. For euthanization, carbon dioxide (CO2) can be used as an alternative to isoflurane.\nNote: Due to the small size, it is best to dissect out the ovary along with the oviduct and uterus before proceeding to separate the ovary (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). The spleen can be placed in phenol red-containing RPMI. We have found no difference in cell viability when either RPMI types (phenol red or phenol free) are used.\nCritical: Always handle the ovary with care to reduce tissue destruction and cell death. Weigh the ovaries to normalize cell counts relative to the ovary weight.\nProcessing of mouse spleen\nTiming: 0.5 h/mouse spleen\nThis section describes the mechanical dissociation of mouse spleen into single cells using the filtra blender bag, which will be utilized as controls for flow cytometry (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3119-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Tissue processing with the filtra bag\n(A) The filtra bag. The filtra bag can be sectioned (B) using a vacuum sealer, into (C) 6 pockets.\n(D and E) Cut up the pockets of the filtra bag using a scissors.\n(F) The filtra bag has an inner mesh which creates two pouches within each bag.\n(G) Place tissue in one pouch of the filtra bag.\n(H and I) Mash tissue with either the cap-end of a sample tube or a syringe plunger respectively.\n(J) Pipette out the cells from the other pouch of the mesh and not where the tissue was initially placed.",
    "Place spleen, with about 3 mL phenol red RPMI media, in one pouch of the filtra blender bag (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A–3G). The filtra bag has two inner pouches separated by a thin mesh (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nUse the cap-end of the sample collection tube or a syringe plunger to gently but thoroughly mash the spleen (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H and 3I).\nAdd 10 mL of PBS to the mashed spleen.\nFrom the other pouch, aspirate the spleen cells and place in a labeled 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant.\nAdd 5 mL ACK Lysing Buffer (Quality Biological #118-156-101) to resuspend the spleen cell pellet and incubate at room temperature (20°C–26°C) for 5 min.\nAdd PBS (20 mL) to stop the ACK reaction, centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4°C, discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet with 10 mL of FACS buffer, filter suspension to remove clumps using a 40 μm cell strainer (Falcon #352340)\nCount cells (using a hemocytometer for total cells or White blood cell counter for WBC counts) and keep on ice.\nNote: If dendritic cells are of interest, enzymatic digestion of the spleen (using liberase (2–3 mg/mL) and DNase 1 (0.5–1 mg/mL) is preferred.\nProcessing and enzymatic digestion of mouse ovaries\nTiming: 0.5 h/mouse ovary\nThis procedure describes a step-by-step enzymatic digestion of the ovaries using the gentleMACS Octo dissociator with heaters (Miltenyi Biotec #130-096-427) (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nPre-fill labeled gentleMACS C tubes (utilized with the dissociator Miltenyi Biotec #130-093-237) with digest solution (RPMI (4.5 mL) and 0.1% collagenase IV (0.5 mL)).",
    "Note: Use of plastic vials in a water bath or incubator set at 37°C can replace use of the Octo dissociator. Investigators are advised to gently shake the tubes every 10 min or to use a rotating surface.\nPlace 100 μL of digest solution on a Petri dish and place the ovaries in the dish.\nLightly grip the ovary and mince the ovary into small bits using a pair of sterile scissors (McPherson–Vannas scissors are suggested).\nTransfer the minced ovaries back into the designated gentleMACS C tube using a 10- or 25-mL serological pipet and secure the lid tightly (Parafilm can be used to seal the tubes and prevent leakage).\nInvert and insert the tubes with the minced ovaries onto the dissociator holders.\nDissociate tissues using the custom program: 20m:00s; Temp: on (37°C); rpr 400.\nAt the end of the program, remove tubes, revert to upright position, and place immediately on ice for 1 min to begin the process of quenching the reaction.\nPour the cold tissue mix into a filtra or blender bag (Labplas #SCT07012A).\nUsing the cap-end of the tube or a syringe plunger, gently mash the remaining tissue pieces.\nAdd 5 mL of phenol-red free RPMI media to further quench the reaction.\nLabel 50 mL tubes and place 40 μm strainers on each tube (always keep tubes on ice).\nPipette out the fluid from the other side of the filtra blender bag and place immediately onto the strainer on the 50 mL tube.\nSpin down at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4°C.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer for total cells or a White blood cell (WBC) counter for leukocyte counts.",
    "Note: The filtra bag comes as a 7″ × 12″ bag and can be split into 4 (or more sections) using an impulse sealer (MJ Equipment Express #PFS-300).\nAlternatives: Cell strainers (100 μm, Falcon #352360) can be utilized to mash the spleens in place of filtra blender bags.\nStaining of cells\nTiming: 1.5 h\nIn this step, we describe staining of cells with fluorescent-labeled antibodies for T cell identification via flow cytometry.\nLabel 5 mL FACS tubes (Fisher Scientific #352052) for each sample: compensation beads, single-stained cells, florescence-minus one stained cells (FMOs), fully stained samples, unstained samples.\nTransfer cell suspensions into FACS tubes (∼0.5–1 million cells for unstained, single-stained and FMOs, and 2–5 million cells for fully stained samples).\nVortex briefly and centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 100 μL Zombie Aqua (1:50) (see Reagent setup).\nCover tubes with aluminum foil and incubate at room temperature for 20 min.\nWithout washing, add 20 μL of Fc blocking buffer (1:10) (see Reagent setup).\nIncubate at room temperature for another 10 min.\nWithout washing, add 20 μL of each antibody to the sample tube as required (see Antibody mix preparation).\nVortex briefly, completely cover tubes with aluminum foil and incubate at 4°C for 30 min in the dark.\nWash with 1 mL of FACS buffer, vortex briefly and centrifuge at 1200 rpm for 5 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend with ∼120 mL FACS buffer.",
    "Note: For flow cytometry studies, we combine spleen and ovarian cells for single-stained (cells stained with a single fluorescent antibody marker used in the experiment) and florescence minus one (FMO) (cell samples that include all the antibody conjugates used in the test samples except one) controls.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] These controls ensure accurate identification of immune cells of interest. In addition, this process is particularly suitable when a large antibody panel is required.\nCritical: We use ∼ 2–5 million cells for fully stained ovary and spleen samples, respectively. Combine spleen cells with ovary cells for single-stained and FMO controls (at an approximate ratio of 3:1–0.5 respectively). If the yield of ovary cells is insufficient to include in both single-stained and FMO controls, ovary cells can be excluded from the single-stained controls, but it is imperative that ovary cells are included in the FMO controls to ensure accurate gating.\nData collection\nTiming: 3–4 h (dependent on sample size)\nThis step describes the acquisition of data on the flow cytometer and identification of T cells by flow cytometry (troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nCollect data on flow cytometer.\nNote: we collected data for the current protocol on a BD FACS Symphony A5.\nUse unstained samples, stained compensation beads, and single-stained samples to\nset appropriate PMT voltages,\nplace all events in the linear range of each detector, and to\ncalculate compensation.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11],12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]\nExclude non-cellular debris and unlysed erythrocytes using a FSC-A by SSC-A light scatter gate during analysis (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3119-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "(E) CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were gated from the CD45+CD3+ population.\n(F) DNT cells were gated by exclusion of CD8+, CD4+, and NKT cells.\nExclude doublets and aggregated cells using a FSC-A by FSC-H gate (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nSelect Zombie Aqua negative live cells for subsequent analysis (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nIdentify T cells as CD45+CD3+ cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D) and classify further as CD8+ and CD4+ T cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E). Gate double negative T (DNT) cells by excluding CD8+, CD4+ and NK1.1+ cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F), and identify NKT cells as CD3+ CD4-, CD8- and NK1.1+ (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F)."
