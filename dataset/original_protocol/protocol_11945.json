    "1. Preparations\nPrepare ½ Murashige and Skoog agar pH 5.7 with no sucrose (1 L).\nDissolve 2.2 g of Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium in 950 mL of ultrapure water. Adjust pH to 5.7 with 5 M KOH.\nMake up the solution to a final volume of 1 L with ultrapure water. Divide it into two 500 mL bottles, each containing 1% plant agar. Autoclave at 121 °C for 20 min.\nPrepare ¼ MS liquid at pH 5.7 with no sucrose (1 L).\nDissolve 1.1 g of MS in 950 mL of ultrapure water. Adjust pH to 5.7 with 5 M KOH. Make up the solution to a final volume of 1 L with ultrapure water. Divide it into two 500 mL bottles. Autoclave at 121 °C for 20 min.\nPrepare GA4.\nDissolve the GA4 in ethanol 70% to make a final concentration of 100 mM GA4 stock.\nTo prepare working solution, dilute the GA4 stock to 0.1–1 µM in ¼ MS liquid pH 5.7.\n2. Plant Growth\nSterilize the Arabidopsis seeds.\nWork using a chemical hood. Aliquot seeds (approximately 200 seeds) into 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Use a marker with chlorine-resistant ink and place the tubes with open lids inside the sterilization vessel (a large box that can be sealed).\nPlace a 250 mL beaker containing 50 mL of ultrapure water and 50 mL of sodium hypochlorite solution inside the sterilization vessel.\nAdd 3 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl) to the beaker. Immediately seal the vessel and allow sterilization by chlorine gas for 6–16 h.\nAfter unsealing the vessel, close the lids of all the microcentrifuge tubes in the seed rack. Sterilized seeds can be stored dry until the time of plating.",
    "Sow approximately 20 sterilized Arabidopsis seeds on ½ MS agar square plates. Seal the plates with porous surgical tape and wrap them with aluminum foil. Incubate them at 4 °C for 1–3 days for stratification.\nFor root imaging, transfer the plates to the growth chamber in a vertical position for 3 days with the following growth conditions: long-day conditions (LD, 16 h of light/8 h of dark); 120 µmol⋅m-2s-1 light intensity; temperature of 22 °C (during the light cycle) or 18 °C (during the dark cycle), 65% relative humidity (RH).\nFor dark-grown hypocotyl: transfer the plates to the growth chamber for a light pulse of 1–4 h to synchronize the germination. Wrap the plates with aluminum foil and place them into the growth chamber in a vertical position for 3 days.\n3. Sample Preparation\nSteady-state measurements (Figure 1A)\nOn a clean microscope slide, add 50 µL of ¼ MS liquid (from now on termed as mock solution). Gently transfer seedlings expressing nlsGPS1 from the plate to the slide.\nTake a clean coverslip and spot a drop of vacuum grease on each corner of the coverslip. Gently place the coverslip over the seedlings and carefully add extra mock solution to remove any air bubbles.\nGA4 treatment: chemical exchange experiment (Figure 1B).\nBefore the GA4 treatment, use a 20 mL syringe filled with vacuum grease (attached to a pipet tip) to draw a rectangle (length: 3.5 cm, height: 2.5 cm) with a uniform layer of vacuum grease on a clean glass slide (Figure 1B). To allow for a fine line of vacuum grease, the pipet tip should be cut to have an opening of 1 mm in diameter.",
    "Add 50 µL of mock solution to the glass slide. With clean forceps, pick the nlsGPS1 seedlings and gently place them on the mock solution. To prevent any damage, transfer the seedlings by supporting the undersides of the cotyledons without grasping the seedling with the forceps.\nTake a clean coverslip and spot a drop of vacuum grease on each corner of the coverslip. Using the forceps, place the coverslip in the center of the vacuum grease rectangle. Now the coverslip is sealed on the two sides corresponding to the long edges of the vacuum grease rectangle.\nCarefully add extra mock solution to fill up the reservoir and remove any air bubbles within the reservoir without disturbing the seedling(s) inside.\nAcquire the images before the GA4 treatment using a confocal microscope. Follow the instructions as described in section 4 of this protocol.\nFor the GA4 treatment, remove the microscope slide from the confocal stage. Set a timer for 20 min.\nAfter starting the timer, exchange the buffer solution with ¼ MS liquid containing 1 µM GA4. Add the GA4 solution (approximately 50 µL) from the left side of the coverslip and remove the previous (mock) solution from the right side. Keep on exchanging the solution to replace the mock solution completely, which takes approximately 10 min (Figure 1B).\nPlace the glass slide back on the microscope stage. Wait another 10 min before acquiring the after-GA image.\nSet up of a time course for the tissue of interest \nNOTE: The tissue of interest might be, for instance, hypocotyls or roots. We routinely perform time courses for imaging nlsGPS1 biosensor using a commercial perfusion system (Figure 1C, see Table of Materials) or a RootChip7,10,11.",
    "Add 200 µL of mock solution to the center of the perfusion channel of the sticky-slide (see Table of Materials). Gently pick nlsGPS1 seedlings and place them on the mock solution in the sticky-slide.\nUsing forceps, gently place the glass coverslip and, using the backside of the forceps, press gently on the outer edges of the coverslip so that it forms a strong bond with the sticky material on the periphery of the sticky-slide.\nUsing two elbow Luer connectors (with an inner diameter [ID] of 0.8 mm) and the silicone tubing (with an ID of 0.8 mm), connect the sticky-slide to a 20 mL syringe and to an outlet container collecting the outflow solution. Use the Luer lock connector (with an ID of 0.8 mm) to connect the syringe to the silicone tubing.\nGently press the syringe containing the mock solution manually to let enough solution pass through the chamber so that there are no air bubbles left in the chamber. Place and hold the syringe on the programmable syringe pump.\nSet the pump parameters specific to the syringe used (i.e., diameter and volume) along with the flow rate according to the manual provided with the pump.\nNOTE: In this protocol, a flow rate of 1–3 mL/h was used, and this can be changed according to the experimental demands. Initiate the time course by starting the pump.\nFor GA4 treatment during a time course (Figure 1C), stop the perfusion by pausing the pump and change the syringe with a new one containing ¼ MS liquid supplemented with GA4. Proceed with confocal imaging as shown in the next section.\n4. Microscopy\nNOTE: We perform confocal laser microscopy.\nAcquire images using a confocal microscope equipped with lasers to perform FRET imaging.",
    "NOTE: For nlsGPS1, variants of cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) are imaged. In this protocol, commercial microscopes (see Table of Materials, listed as microscope 1 and 2) are used with 10x or 20x dry 0.70 harmonic compound PLAN APO objectives.\nFor microscope 1, use 448 nm and 514 nm wavelength lasers to excite CFP and YFP, respectively. Acquire sequential scans. Set detectors (e.g., HyD SMD) to detect 460–500 nm for CFP (donor emission) and 525–560 nm for YFP (FRET emission) after the excitation of CFP. Using a second sequence, set a detector to detect 525–560 nm for YFP (YFP emission) after the excitation of YFP.\nNOTE: This YFP fluorescence is used as an expression control, as well as in segmenting nuclei, to generate surfaces using a commercial 3-D micrograph visualization and analysis software.\nFor microscope 2, use 440 nm and 514 nm wavelength laser lines to excite CFP and YFP, respectively. Acquire two tracks. For track 1, set detectors (e.g., ChS) to detect 464–500 nm for CFP (donor emission) and 526–562 nm for YFP (FRET emission) after the excitation of CFP. For track 2, set a detector to detect 526–562 nm for YFP (YFP emission) after the excitation of YFP.\nNOTE: This YFP fluorescence is used as an expression control, as well as in segmenting nuclei, to generate surfaces in the 3-D visualization and analysis software.\nAcquire images using a format of 512 x 512 pixels and a resolution of 12 bits.",
    "The gain needs to be adjusted to an empirically determined value that allows for a good signal while not saturating pixels. The gain should not be changed between CFP and FRET emission over the experiment. Set the pinhole to 1 airy unit (AU). Place the IBIDI sticky-slide at the stage of the confocal microscope, and proceed with imaging as previously shown.\nIn the microscope 1 software, while in an active live scan, utilize Glow over/under located on the top left side of the image screen to determine the underexposure and saturation of the region of interest. In the microscope 2 software, utilize Range Indicator located on the bottom side of the image screen to determine the underexposure and saturation of the region of interest. For any quantitative image analysis, there should be no pixel saturation.\nSet the z-stacks with a step size of 1 μm. The step size can be reduced for an increased z-resolution or increased for an increased speed of acquisition or to increase the number of positions/samples that can be imaged. For the automated time course, set the time along with the z-stacks (xyzt mode from the acquisition mode tab) to acquire the images at set time intervals.\n5. Image Analysis Using Fiji\nNOTE: Using ImageJ (Fiji) it is possible to process imaging data and produce two-dimensional (2-D) images of the nlsGPS1 emission ratio in Arabidopsis seedlings. For examples of images, see Figure 2A, 2C, 2E, 2G, and 3A. In ImageJ, it is possible to find each command of this protocol using the search function. Press the space bar and L on the computer keyboard. A new window will open; type the required command in the search field.\nDrag the file (either .lif or .lsm files) into Fiji (Image J) and open the images as hyper-stack.",
    "From the main menu, select Image > Stack > Z project and select Sum slices to capture all pixels rather than only the brightest pixels as in Max projection.\nFrom the main menu, select Process > Subtract background and set the rolling ball radius to 50 pixels. Unselect any other options and process all three images. This step removes background using the “rolling ball” algorithm.\nNOTE: 50 pixels was empirically determined to include nuclei as foreground.\nFrom the main menu, select Image > Color > Split channels. Three new windows will open: C1-SUM (CFP channel); C2-SUM (FRET channel), and C3-SUM (YFP channel).\nSelect the C3-SUM window and, from the main menu, select Process > Filters > Gaussian Blur and apply a Gaussian Blur of 1 to reduce the image noise.\nFrom the main menu, select Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast and select auto.\nFrom the main menu, select Process > Enhance Contrast, and set saturated = 0.35.\nFrom the main menu, select Image > Type > 8-bit and convert the stacks into an 8-bit image.\nFrom the main menu, select Image > Adjust > Auto-Local Threshold. In the Auto-Local Threshold, select the following parameters: Phansalkar method, radius = 15, parameter 1 = 0, parameter 2 = 0, and white stack. In this step, YFP stacks are used to make a binary mask.\nSelect the C2-SUM window and, from the main menu, select Process > Filters > Gaussian Blur and apply a Gaussian Blur of 1.\nSelect the C1-SUM window and, from the main menu, select Process > Filters > Gaussian Blur and apply a Gaussian Blur of 1.",
    "To create the emission ratio stack from the two channels, from the main menu, select Process > Image Calculator. In the new window that will appear, select C2-SUM as image 1, select Divide as operator, and select C1 sum as image 2.\nMake sure to select Create a new window and the 32-bit format. A new window will appear named Result of C2-SUM.\nFrom the main menu, select Image > Lookup table > LUT 16_colors.\nFrom the main menu, select Process > Image Calculator. In the new window that will appear, select Result of C2-SUM as image 1, select Multiply as operator, and select C3-SUM as image 2. In this step, the YFP binary mask is multiplied with the YFP/CFP stack to show only pixels present in the YFP control channel.\nFrom the main menu, select Process > Math > Divide and set the value to 255. In the new window that opens, select Yes to analyze all images in the stack. A new image will appear named Result of Result of C2-SUM.\nFrom the main menu, select Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast and select Auto.\nFrom the main menu, select Process > Enhance Contrast, and select Type saturated = 0.35.\nFrom the main menu, select Image > Adjust > Brightness/Contrast, and set minimum and maximum values to capture the GA distribution. Optional step: from the main menu, select Analyze > Tools > Calibration Bar and Show LUT-calibration bar, and save the Result of Result of C2-SUM as a .tiff file.\nTo obtain values of the emission ratios, from the main menu, select Analyze > Set measurement and select Mean gray value and Standard deviation.",
    "Select the rectangle shape from the toolbar and draw a region of interest (ROI). From the main menu, select Analyze > Measure. A new window will report the mean value from the selected ROI.\nCopy and paste the obtained values into spreadsheet software (e.g., Excel or OriginPro) and make either a histogram for a before-and-after GA4 treatment experiment or a line graph for a time course experiment.\n6. Image Analysis Using 3-D Visualization and Analysis Software\nNOTE: The advantage of using the selected software (see Table of Materials) is to segment objects (e.g., nuclei) and create 3-D images from a confocal z-stack. For examples of images, see Figure 2B, 2D, 2F, 2H, and 3B.\nOpen the software and import the file (either .lif or .lsm files).\nSegment nuclei based on the control YFP emission channel using the Surfaces wizard. The segmented objects are termed “surfaces”. This segmentation step permits the analysis of all voxels in a nucleus as one object while eliminating background from voxels outside of the nucleus.\nIn the Surfaces wizard, set the background subtraction (local contrast) to 3 µm and the thresholding to default. Mask the CFP emission (donor excitation donor emission [DxDm]) and FRET emission (donor excitation acceptor emission [DxAm]) channels based on the surfaces created using the YFP emission (acceptor excitation acceptor emission [AxAm]) channel.\nUse the extension XT Mean Intensity Ratio to compute a ratio of donor excitation acceptor emission divided by donor excitation donor emission (DxAm/DxDm) between the mean intensity values of the individual surfaces in the two channels.\nNOTE: This extension is available online for download.\nTo color the individual surfaces with the nlsGPS1 emission ratio, select Color coding with statistics, which is represented as a color wheel icon. Select Mean intensity ratio as statistics type.",
    "Export the ratios of individual values from the table, which is found under the Statistics icon.\nCopy and paste the values into a spreadsheet and make either a histogram for before-and-after GA4 treatment experiments or a linear graph for time course experiments.\n7. Statistical Analysis\nNOTE: See Figure 3D for a beeswarm and box plot of nlsGPS1 emission ratios.\nOpen the software and paste the emission ratio of the nuclei surfaces as Y columns.\nSelect the columns of interest and select Statistics > Statistics Description > Normality test to know whether the samples are normally distributed. Run the Normality test and a new window will open and report the results.\nIf the samples are normally distributed, use the t-test as statistical test. Select Statistics > Hypothesis testing > Two-Sample t-test on Rows and run the t-test.\nIf the samples are not normally distributed, select Statistics > Statistics Hypothesis testing > Two-Sample test for variance to know whether the variance between the samples is not significantly different.\nIf the variance is not significantly different, use the Mann-Whitney U test as statistical test. Select Statistics > Nonparametric Test > Mann-Whitney test and run the test.\nIf the variance is significantly different, use Kruskal Wallis ANOVA test as statistical test. Select Statistics > Nonparametric Test > Kruskal Wallis ANOVA test and run the test."
