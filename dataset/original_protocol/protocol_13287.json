    "All procedures involving animal subjects were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Chang Bing Show Chwan Memorial Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan (111031) on October 2022 (Figure 1).\n1. Preparation of animals\nPurchase 48 maleSprague-Dawley (SD) rats (age: 8-10 weeks, weight: 250-300 g).\nHouse rats individually in ventilated cages at 24 ± 2 °C and a 12-h dark and light cycle.\nFeed rats a standard pellet diet with sterile drinking water ready to use, and provide soft bedding.\n2. Grouping of animals\nRandomly divide 48 SD rats into six groups (n = 8 per group): the sham group, CCI group, CCI+FSN group, CCI+TENS group, FSN alone group, and TENS alone group as in the previous study conducted by Chan et al.24.\n\t​NOTE: The details of six groups: (1) Sham group: no surgery and no treatment; (2) CCI group: prepared for surgery with no treatment; (3) CCI+FSN treatment group: FSN treatment after successful CCI modeling; (4) CCI+TENS treatment group: TENS treatment after successful CCI modeling; (5) FSN treatment alone group: only FSN treatment without surgery; (6) TENS treatment alone group: only TENS treatment without surgery.\n3. Establishment of a CCI rat model\nNOTE: The CCI surgery model in rats was modified according to Bennett and Xie conducted in 198825.\nEnsure the operator wears a surgical mask, disposable operating cap, and sterile gloves.\nDisinfect the surface of the surgical table with 70% ethanol. Sterilize instruments (e.g., scissors, forceps, and retractors), gauze, staples, and cotton swabs by autoclaving.\n\tNOTE: Aseptic techniques are used throughout the surgical procedure.\nAnesthetize the rats with 4% isoflurane after standard skin preparation (shaving) and maintain with 2% isoflurane (Figure 2A).",
    "Confirm the appropriate depth of anesthesia by observing the lack of response after pinching the hind paw and monitoring the anesthetized rats throughout the procedure.\nApply enough veterinary ophthalmic ointment over the eyes for protection against drying.\nPlace the rat in the prone position on the operating table and shave the hair on the side of the right hind leg, then sterilize with povidone-iodine solution and 75% ethanol three times.\n\t\nMake a parallel incision in the skin 3-4 mm below the femur of about 20-50 mm.\nPrioritize the identification of the positions of gluteus maximus and biceps femoris. Separate the subcutaneous fat and superficial fascia layer by layer using surgical scissors, cutting through the surrounding connective tissue to expose the muscle (Figure 2B).\n\t\tNOTE: To distinguish the subcutaneous fat and superficial fascia layers, observe the texture and color. The subcutaneous fat layer should appear soft and pliable with a yellowish or whitish appearance. The superficial fascia is a thin fibrous layer situated directly beneath the subcutaneous fat. Differentiate between the layers by gently palpating or probing with a blunt instrument, noting that the subcutaneous fat offers more resistance to pressure compared to the superficial fascia.\nUsing blunt scissors, cut the connective tissue between the superficial gluteus and biceps femoris muscles.\n\t\nWiden the gap between these two muscles using a retractor to expose the sciatic nerve (Figure 2C).\n\t\tNOTE: To visually identify the sciatic nerve in a rat, focus on the thigh region. Locate the midpoint of the thigh region to visualize the sciatic nerve. Typically, the nerve runs along the posterior aspect of the thigh, starting from the hip region and extending toward the knee.",
    "Without altering the nerve morphology, pick the sciatic nerve with a microneedle through a good light source. Ligate the sciatic nerve twice using 3-0 chromic gut ligatures, positioning the ligature points approximately 1 mm apart between the two sutures.\nStarting with a loose loop for each ligature, grasp the ends of the ligature close to the loop and tighten until the loop is just snug, ensuring that the ligature does not slip along the nerve. Stop when slight twitching of the limb is observed during ligation (Figure 2D).\nClose the muscle and skin layer by layer with 4-0 suture lines. Finally, disinfect the wound with iodine (Figure 2E).\nClosely monitor the rats for signs of vitality during anesthesia and place them in individual recovery cages until they are awake before placing them back in their cages. Line the cages with flat paper bedding to prevent asphyxiation in unconscious animals. A brief twitch in the post-operative limb indicates a successful operation (Figure 2F).\nPerform pain hypersensitivity testing several times before CCI (baseline) and at different time points after CCI.\nObserve for spontaneous pain and behavioral changes on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 following model construction.\n\tNOTE: Observe the gait and posture of the right hind limb and the presence of licking and biting on the limb.\n\t\nIdentify the presence of neuropathic pain to determine the successful establishment of the model and exclude unsuccessful rats.\n\t\t​NOTE: Assess the success of the model by observing signs such as weakness in lower limb walking, toes of the right limb held together with mild valgus, frequent dangling, and reluctance to land. Observe the rat standing with the left hind limb supporting the weight, while the right hind limb is raised and close to the abdomen.\n4. Administration of FSN manipulation",
    "Fix the rat of the FSN treatment group (including CCI+FSN and FSN alone group) in the rodent restraint with the affected limb exposed laterally. Both groups were treated with FSN disposable needles (Figure 3A).\nWithout anesthesia, extend the rat's hind limbs gradually and slowly until they were stretched tight (Figure 3B).\n\tNOTE: The rat head is covered with a surgical drape to keep the animal calm and stable. Do not overextend the leg to cause injury to the rat. Observe the rat's response closely for any signs of distress or discomfort. If the rat shows signs of pain or discomfort, stop the extension and provide a break before attempting again.\nRemove the protecting sheath of the FSN needle.\n\t\nInsert the tip of the FSN needle toward the TMs (muscles with MTrPs), approximately close to the gluteus maximus muscle, located on the lower back and rear.\nPlace the FSN needle flat and enter the skin at an angle of approximately 15°.\n\t\nPush it carefully and quickly to prevent tension in the rat until fully inserted. Ensure that the needle is inserted sufficiently to completely bury the soft tube under the skin.\nWhen pushing forward, raise the needle tip slightly to observe if the skin bulge moves along the needle tip (Figure 3C).\nPerform the swaying movement by smoothly and softly fanning the FSN needle tip with the thumb as the fulcrum while keeping the index finger, middle finger, and ring finger aligned in a straight line.\n\t\nHold the FSN needle between the middle finger and thumb in a face-to-face position, and alternate the movement back and forth using the index and ring fingers.\nSet the frequency to 100 strokes per minute and perform the operation for approximately 1 min (Figure 3D).\nAfter completing the manipulation, quickly withdraw the FSN needle.",
    "​NOTE: The operation was performed every 2 days for a total of four sessions (days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after the CCI model was created). Disposable FSN needles must be used once. Repeated use will blunt the needle and cause increased pain in rats.\n5. Administration of TENS manipulation\nFix the rat of the TENS treatment group (including CCI+TENS and TENS alone group) in the rodent restraint with the affected limb exposed laterally. Ensure that the fur is shaved before being treated.\n\tNOTE: Electrodes were cut to 45 mm (length) by 5 mm (width) (Figure 4A).\nChoose Zusanli point (ST36) and Sanyinjiao point (SP6) as the locations for TENS. This is based on the theory for treating neuropathic pain26,27.\n\t\nLocate the Zusanli point (ST36) approximately 5 mm lateral to the anterior tubercle of the tibia between the tibia and fibula just below the knee28.\nLocate the Sanyinjiao point (SP6) at the posterior border of the tibia, 3 mm proximal to the medial malleolus28.\n\t\tNOTE: Both of these two acupuncture points are located by manual inspection as described by Stux and Pomeranz and in the animal acupuncture atlas28,29 (Figure 4B).\nDeliver a low-frequency electrical stimulation (2 Hz continuous sine wave, 3 mA) for 10 min using the TENS device with the electrode applied on the leg around the nerve. Cover the head of the rat head with a surgical drape to keep it calm and stable.\n\t​NOTE: This procedure is performed every 2 days for a total of four sessions (days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after the CCI model was created).\n6. Physiological measurements performing the animal behavioral test",
    "NOTE: Sciatic function index (SFI)30 is a widely used index by researchers studying pathology and potential treatment of nerve injuries, determined by comparing the geometry of the affected hind paw in injured rats with that of the contralateral paw and comparing it with the opposite paw.\nDesign rat walkways with clear plexiglass and tilt mirrors to capture the footprints and body orientation of rats during the walk.\n\tNOTE: The walkway is a platform 10 cm long, 50 cm wide, and 15 cm high with a white paper lining at the bottom (Figure 5A).\nGently and freely place the rats in the box and allow them to acclimatize to their new environment for at least 5 min before recording.\n\tNOTE: Special care is taken to minimize unnecessary stress on the animal to avoid its possible effect on postural muscle tension.\nDip the rat's paws in red ink and allow the rat to walk along the walkway strip, leaving traces on the backing paper. Record at least 2 s of continuous walking for each test. Make the rat walk at least 3 times in one direction (Figure 5B).\n\tNOTE: Apply quick-drying, nontoxic, water-soluble red ink to both hind feet to make the hind footprints clearly visible.\nAt the end of the experiment, dry the walkway strips to measure the parameters. Measure their footprints with a ruler and round to the nearest 0.5 mm.\n\tNOTE: Three clear footprints from each rat were selected from several footprints, and three different parameters were measured. Factors for SFI include print length (PL), toe spread (TS), and intermediate toe spread (ITS).\n\tSFI values are calculated using the following formula31:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65406/65406eq01.jpg\n\t(EPL, experimental print length; NPL, normal print length; ETS, experimental toe spread; NTS, normal toe spread; EIT, experimental intermediate toe spread; NIT, intermediate toe spread.)",
    "SFI = 0 and - 100 indicates normal and complete dysfunction. Rats that dragged their toes were arbitrarily assigned a value of -100. For normal neurological function, the SFI oscillates around 0, while around -100 SFI represents complete dysfunction32.\n7. Neurophysiological assessment by electrophysiological measurement33\nNOTE: Electromyography was used to record the electrophysiological activity in this study. The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) is caused by the activation of muscle fibers in the target muscle supplied by the nerve. CMAP amplitude and latency are investigated. The CMAP amplitude is measured from baseline to negative peak.The latency of CMAPs is determined by measuring the time between the application of the stimulus and the onset of the compound action potential, which is influenced by the distance between the stimulation site and the recording site. Electrophysiology provides an objective assessment of peripheral nerve function in rats.\nAdminister Zoletil 50 (40 mg/kg, ip) to anesthetize the rats. Prepare the skin according to standard protocols (shaving).\nPlace disposable adhesive surface electrodes (20 mm outer diameter) on the designated areas. Fix the recording electrodes to the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the gastrocnemius muscle (Figure 6A).\nApply electrical stimulation (intensity 1.2 mA) to the right proximal sciatic nerve stem. Record a compound muscle action potential (CMAP) on the belly of the gastrocnemius muscle (Figure 6B).\n\tNOTE: Be careful when inserting the electrodes to avoid the muscle tissue.\nRecord the effect of three repeated measurements for each rat.",
    "NOTE: CMAP is expressed as the mean ± SD of each group. The signal was amplified by an amplifier, filtered (0.3-3 kHz). After integration (time constant = 0.05 s), both the original signal and the integrated signal are input. The original signal and the integrated signal are then digitized in the PowerLab system and stored on the computer hard disk.\nAfter completing the electrophysiology procedures, move the rat to a different cage and monitor it until it regains enough consciousness to maintain a sternal recumbent position. Once the rat has fully recovered from the anesthetic, transfer it back to its original cage.\n8. Statistics:\nEvaluate differences in SFI and CMAPs between groups using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA).\nQuantify the data by assistants who are blind to the experimental conditions. Express the data as mean ± standard deviation.\nCompare the data, when appropriate, using Student's two-tailed paired and unpaired t-test. Establish statistical significance as p < 0.05.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
