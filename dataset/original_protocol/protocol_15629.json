    "This study was approved by the ethics committee of Okayama Rosai Hospital (No. 305).\n1. Patient history taking\nEnsure that the patient has a herniated disc that causes severe sciatica. Usually, the patient will have a history of some prodromal low back pain. They may correlate their symptoms with an episode of trauma.\nAsk the patient to describe their radiating leg pain, including its location. Also ask them about the activities that make it better or worse when LFS or LLDH is suspected.\n2. Physical examination\nTo determine the nerve level, check for the signs of the loss of sensation and weakness in the leg.\nPerform a range of lumbar motion tests by asking the patient to bend forward and backward.\n\t\nCheck for the induction of low back pain in the patient with a herniated disc when forward bending is done.\nElevate the patient's leg in a supine position. If the angle between the bed and the leg is less than 70° due to sciatica, this is a strong suggestion that the patient has a herniated disc, which means the straight leg raise (SLR) test is positive.\n\t\tNOTE: The SLR test is very useful to distinguish between lumbar canal stenosis (SLR-) and lumbar disc herniation (SLR+).\nPerform deep tendon reflex, and check muscle weakness in the patient.\nPerform the Kemp test7. Fix the patient's opposite ilium from the side being tested with one hand in a standing position. Grab the patient's shoulder with the other hand and lead the patient to extension, ipsilateral side bending, and rotation.\n\tNOTE: LFS is characterized by exacerbation with foraminal narrowing caused by lumbar extension (Kemp's sign)7. If the Kemp test is positive, foraminal nerve compression by disc herniation or stenosis is likely.\n3. Evaluation of radiograms (XP) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)",
    "Perform anteroposterior and lateral radiography in a standing position to check lumbar deformity and spondylolisthesis. If the patient has severe deformity, spinal fusion is indicated.\nPerform functional radiography in a standing position. Check the functional radiograms to confirm lumbar instability by measuring vertebral abnormal movement (Figure 1A, B).\n\tNOTE: If there is severe instability that indicates more than 10° or more than 3 mm slip at the L5-S1 level, L5-S1 fusion should be considered.\nPerform MRI to accurately assess the nerve compression site.\n\t\nFor lateral lumbar disc herniation (LLDH), take a coronal T2 weighted image to identify the location of the herniated disc (Figure 1C-E).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63603/63603fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Preoperative radiograms and MRI.

Evaluation of computed tomography (CT) and MRI-CT fusion images\nPerform CT to check if there is a calcified disc (Figure 2A, D) or foraminal osteophyte (Figure 2B, C) not by the disc.\nTake an MRI-CT fusion image to understand the exact 3D location of the herniated disc (Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63603/63603fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Preoperative CT.

Patient positioning and neuromonitoring (NM)\nProvide general anesthesia to the patient.\nThen, place the patient in a prone position on a carbon table.",
    "Ensure that the patient's eyes are not compressed with a special face cover. Pay attention to the bolster position not to compress the abdomen of the patient.\nPerform neuromonitoring using a multi-modality intraoperative monitoring system that assesses spinal cord integrity and provides a warning of potential harm to critical neural pathways (Figure 4A).Transcranial motor evoked potentials (MEPs) generate a stimulus at the motor cortex.\n\t\nUse recording electrodes to measure the signals at predetermined peripheral upper and lower extremity muscle group sites.\n\t\tNOTE: If neuromonitoring is used, nerve decompression is also confirmed with this. For a muscle of which the innervated nerve is decompressed adequately, the amplitude of the MCV usually increases.\n6. Intraoperative CT scan and spinal navigation\nPlace a navigation reference frame (RF) percutaneously into the spinous process or sacroiliac joint. Obtain intraoperative CT scan images with a mobile CT scanner (Figure 4B).\nTransmit the CT 3D images to the navigation system automatically using a cable (Figure 4C).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63603/63603fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Neuromonitoring, O-arm, and navigation.

Navigated instrument registration\nRegister the navigated pointer, dilater, and high-speed burr by tapping the tip to the RF hole manually. Then, perform the accuracy check by touching the bony surface.\n8. Incision and muscle dissection\nWith the help of a navigated pointer, confirm the location of the L5-S1 foraminal level by a 50-60 mm extended image from the pointer tip and mark the entry point for the skin incision (Figure 5A).\nMake an approximately 2 cm longitudinal skin incision, and then dissect the subcutaneous tissue, lumbar iliocostalis, and multifidus muscle along the muscle fibers.",
    "Dock the navigated first dilator at the base of the L5 transverse process using a navigation system (Figure 5B). Then, insert the sequential dilators (5.3 mm, 9.4 mm).\nInsert the final tube (14 mm) and fix it to the flexible arm assembly firmly (Figure 5C). Confirm the position of the tube with a navigation system and the anatomy through endoscopy.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63603/63603fig05.jpg\nFigure 5: Skin incision and sequential dilation.

Bone resection with the navigated high-speed burr\nCheck the level with the navigated probe. Check the L5-S1 level with a navigated pointer in the navigation monitor.\nRemove the bone at the lower base of the transverse process and the lateral part of the facet joint with a navigated high-speed burr or conventional high-speed burr (Figure 6).\n\tNOTE: Further surgical steps are planned according to the disc herniation or canal stenosis.\nIn the case of canal stenosis, remove the bony element that compresses the nerve root completely.\n\tCAUTION: Before using the navigated instruments, the surgeon should check the accuracy of navigation because sometimes the reference frame is moved.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63603/63603fig06.jpg\nFigure 6: Navigated high-speed burr.

Endoscopic disc resection\nFor LLDH, identify the L5 nerve root and retract cranially by a nerve retractor. Then, remove the disc fragment using pituitary forceps carefully.\nIn the case of LFS, widen the L5 foramen using a navigated high-speed burr under navigation guidance.\nRemove every compressing soft tissue and bony element by pituitary forceps and Kerrison rongeurs. Identify the L5 root by its surrounding perineural fat and vessels (Figure 7).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63603/63603fig07.jpg",

Skin closure\nAfter irrigation with saline water to remove the debris, place a wound suction tube at L5-S1.\nThen, close the skin with an absorbable suture.\nPostoperatively, remove the drain after 48 h.\n\tNOTE: Postoperative images are shown in Figure 8.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63603/63603fig08.jpg\nFigure 8: Postoperative images.
