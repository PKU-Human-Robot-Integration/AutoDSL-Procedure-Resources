    "The individual IACUC at each location (Kansas State University and Virginia Tech University) approved the use of facilities and procedures.\n1. Set-up of the Cameras and Pens and the Establishment of a Routine\nPrior to placing the animals in their pens, fix cameras at a 90° angle over each pen (see Table of Materials for a suggested camera system).\nRecord animals continuously at 30 frames/s (fps), either for the duration of the study or only during the test sessions.\nFix bowls, waterers, mats, and toys with bolts and chains.\nPlace sound machines that continuously play white or pink noise (e.g., the sound of waterfalls) in the pigs’ facility.\nNOTE: External sudden noises (e.g., doors opening and shutting) can cause a startle reflex during the sessions23,24.\nRandomize or stratify treatments by pen across the facility.\nSet up an established animal husbandry routine. This will help the pigs to know when to expect humans to clean the pens, feed and handle them, and perform the test.\nUse a familiar treat to allow the pigs to associate humans with a reward.\nUse a clicker during the reward to allow the pigs to associate the clicking sound with a reward. Do not use vocalizations and visual signals to familiarize the pigs with the reward (see Table of Materials).\nConduct the sessions before the morning meal or before placing a new feed for ad libitum fed pigs.\n2. Identification of the Pigs\nMake subjects identifiable on the video feed, even if they are single-housed.\nMake sure observers remain blind to treatments and unbiased during timestamping with a marking system that is not related to treatments. Use a medical grade tape (see Table of Materials) that is adhered to a strip of duct tape of a specific color, round shape, and pattern.",
    "Use one round patch to mark the top of the pig and one down each side (see Figure 1, green and blue markers).\nSmear tag cement (less than 0.35 g) on the tape corners to help increase the adherence longevity.\nNOTE: Too much tag cement will not dry very quickly, causing the tape to fall off prematurely.\nTroubleshoot and customize the marking strategy during the acclimation period so that official tests are performed efficiently and without added stress to the pigs.\nUse data collection sheets to keep track of the markings and subject identification (see Supplementary File 1 for an example data sheet).\nNOTE: To remove tape, do not rip the tape off because it will cause pain if any hair is pulled out. It can either slough off on its own, a water-based lubricant can help dislodge it, or it can be shaved off with clippers. If the tape comes off at unwanted times, prepare extra marking tape and reapply it while the pig is eating a meal rather than restraining the pig.\n3. HAT Sessions\nHave the test-humans wear the same hat, coveralls, boots, odors, etc. every time the session is conducted.\nConduct sessions daily, at least 3x, before the treatment and, then, daily thereafter.\nThe pig can be in any area in its pen before starting the session. To start the session, ask the test-human to drop the treat in the bowl or in front of the pen and click the clicker 3x.",
    "The test-human needs to place their hands out of the pig’s sight and stand stationary during the test. Have another researcher mark the start of the session on the data sheet and start a timer. After 120 s, the researcher silently signals to the test-human to move to the next subject and restart the test.\n4. Establishment of HAT Ethograms for Software\nConstruct ethograms (see Figures 1 and 2 and Supplementary Video 1) under one project using specialized software.\nNOTE: Spatial behaviors are the location of the animal relative to the human. In the ethograms, the spatial relationships must be customized to the animal’s pen and published every time a novel pen set-up is used (Figure 1). Within this category, behaviors are considered mutually exclusive. The space is divided into four areas, with varying levels of approach (Figure 1). The areas are standardized across housing types. Closest, or climb (Cl) means that pigs may climb on the fence to gain access to the human; therefore, climbing is considered a spatial behavior that indicates the pig is most actively seeking human contact. Close (Co) denotes the area within 61 cm of the human. Mid (M) is the area within 61-122 cm from the human. Far (F) is the area of 123 cm or more from the human.\nStructural behaviors focus on the orientation of the whole body or parts of the body (Figure 2). Create two structural categories: 1) the pig-nose position and 2) the active state of the pig. Use Figure 2A to identify directionality (direction 1 denotes the pig directs its nose towards the human; direction 2 means the pig directs its nose away from the human).",
    "Divide activity behaviors (Figure 2B) into three mutually exclusive states of approach: NNOB, stand or walk without NNOB, and resting without NNOB (see the color coding in the ethograms in the video).\nNOTE: NNOB is used to describe when a pig is using its mouth, snout, or face to lick, sniff, chew, bite, rub, or root a nonnutritive object to seek out either familiarity or novel opportunities. Therefore, when it is in this active state, it is interested in the human, and in an approach-state. If overhead cameras are used at 90° angles, the pig’s nose position and head movement are indicators of NNOB. Occasionally, pigs will chomp or sham-chew; the nose can be seen but the head moves up and down. Stand or walk without NNOB is used to the describe when the pig is in the upright position, the head is still, and the nose is not touching a substrate or chomping, which means it is in less of an approach state. Resting without NNOB is used the describe when the pig is resting by lying or sitting, which is the least approach state under this category of behaviors.\n5. Timestamping of the Videos for Efficiency and Reliability\nBased on the start-times recorded by the data collector, edit the footage into exact, 3 min sessions. The method for timestamping will take 9 min per session.\nOnly use up to two trained observers to timestamp the videos.\nNOTE:: If two observers are used, the intra-observer variation should be quantified, evaluated, adjusted, and then reported as a Pearson correlation coefficient after the observers have timestamped the same sample video (for methods, see Martin and Bateson25).\nSet the playback speed at 1x regular speed (i.e., 30 fps). Do not pause, rewind, or timestamp frame by frame.",
    "Timestamp each category of mutually exclusive behaviors separately.\nTimestamp spatial behaviors. Restart the video.\nTimestamp structural behaviors. Restart the video.\nTimestamp for structural/nose position behaviors.\nUse the duration of each behavior outcome (see Supplementary Videos 2 and 3) for summarizing data. The duration measurements need to be converted to a percentage of time per category.\n6. Approach Index\nApply the formula (Figure 3) so that each structural and the spatial behavior is combined to create an AI (Figure 3, Figure 4). The AI is used in addition to reporting behaviors and categories separately as figures (Figure 5) or in tabular form.",
    "NOTE: See Table of Materials for software details. Within each category, behavior durations are first converted to percentages (the duration of the behaviors divided by the total duration of the test session). Each behavior is weighted based on the level of approach (Figure 3). Avoidance behaviors (the percentage of time in the far area, resting, with the nose turned away) are multiplied by 0. Moderate-approach behaviors (the percentage of time in the middle area, turned towards the human, and standing with the head still) are multiplied by 1. The greatest level of approach behaviors (the percentage of time in the close and closest area and showing NNOB) are multiplied by 2. Then, each category is further weighted 3, 2, and 1 for spatial, nose orientation, and activity, respectively. A constant (0.10) is applied to create a percentage scale. For example, if the pig faces the human, is in the close/closest area, and performs NNOB during the entire test session, note that the AI is 100% (the red pig in Figure 3). In contrast, if the pig is in the far area, is not facing the human, and remains in the rest position during the entire test session, the AI is 0% (the black pig in Figure 3). Pigs in the close zone can have the same AI as a pig performing NNOB in the mid area if they are turned away from the human and standing with their head still (the orange pigs in Figure 3)."
