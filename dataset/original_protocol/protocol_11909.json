    "1. Induction of spawning, in vitro fertilization, and de-jellying\nMaintain Nematostella vectensis in seawater with a salinity of 12 parts per thousand (ppt) in darkness at 16 °C, feeding Artemia daily.\nOn the day before spawning induction, place animals in a temperature- and light-controlled incubator. Program the incubator so that the animals are exposed to 8 h of light at 25 °C. Optional: Feed a small piece (<1 mm3) of oyster to individual animals before placing them into the incubator to enhance spawning.\nLeave the animals in the incubator for 1 h at 16 °C.\nRemove the animals from the incubator and leave them on a benchtop with light at room temperature (RT) to allow spawning. Spawning usually occurs within the next 1.5–2 h.\nIf males and females are in separate containers, place egg packages from the female container into a sperm-containing male container by using a transfer pipette whose tip is cut to enlarge the opening so that the eggs are not damaged by mechanical stress during transfer. Allow eggs to be fertilized by leaving them in the male container for at least 15 min.\nDe-jelly the egg packages in seawater containing 3% cysteine (pH 7.4) on a Petri dish or in a 15 mL tube. Gently agitate on a shaker for 12 min.\nUse a plastic pipette to break up clumps and continue to agitate for another 2-3 min until completely de-jellied.\nRemove cysteine by replacing the media with fresh seawater for at least 5x.\nKeep the fertilized eggs on a glass Petri dish at 16 °C or RT.\n2. Surgical removal of an aboral tissue from a gastrula embryo",
    "Prepare a DNA extraction buffer consisting of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.3% Tween20, 0.3% NP40, and 1 μg/μL proteinase K. Use 20 μL of the extraction buffer per embryo. Mix well by vortexing and aliquot the buffer into PCR tubes.\nDissolve 1% agarose in seawater and pour it into a Petri dish to cover the bottom. Cool on a benchtop to make a gel bed. Pour fresh seawater to cover the gel bed in the Petri dish.\nTransfer 24 h post-fertilization (hpf) embryos (early- to mid-gastrula stage) into the Petri dish containing an agarose gel bed.\nInsert a tungsten needle into a needle holder and sterilize by dipping the needle tip in alcohol (70% or higher) and placing it in flame to burn off the alcohol.\nUnder a dissecting microscope (at 20x to 40x magnification), use the tungsten needle to make a depression on the agarose bed by removing a piece of surface agarose about the size of an embryo to be manipulated, and place the embryo onto the depression with its lateral side facing down in order to restrict the movement of the embryo for microsurgery.\nUse the tungsten needle to surgically excise a piece of aboral tissue located opposite to the oral blastoporal opening. An aboral one-third to one-quarter of the embryonic tissue along the oral-aboral axis is usually sufficient.\nUse a P20 pipette to transfer the isolated aboral tissue (in <2 μL) to a PCR tube containing 20 μL of DNA extraction buffer.\nTransfer the post-surgery embryo into a well containing at least 500 μL of fresh seawater in a 24- or 96-well plate.\nRepeat steps 2.4–2.8 for the number of embryos as needed.",
    "Place the well plate containing post-surgery embryos in an incubator at 16 °C or RT until genotyping is completed.\n3. Genomic DNA extraction and genotyping PCR\nBriefly spin down the PCR tubes containing the DNA extraction buffer and isolated embryonic tissues using a mini-centrifuge (e.g. at 2,680 x g for 10 s).\nTo extract genomic DNA from single embryos, incubate the PCR tubes at 55 °C for 3 h. Vortex for 30 s every 30 min to ensure breakup of cell clumps and enhance cell lysis.\nIncubate the PCR tubes at 95 °C for 5 min to inactivate proteinase K.\nKeep gDNA extracts at 4 °C or on ice, and immediately proceed to PCR.\n\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here by placing gDNA extracts in a -20 °C freezer.\nSet up a PCR reaction using extracted gDNA as a template to amplify the genomic locus of interest.\n\t\nIf different alleles at the locus of interest differ in size so that the size difference can be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis, design a single set of primers to amplify the entire locus.\nAlternatively, use allele-specific primers that generate PCR products only in the presence of the specific allele; for instance, by designing the primer that binds to a region containing insertion/deletion mutations.\nUse a typical 20 μL PCR reaction mix as follows: 5 μL of gDNA extracts, 8 μL of nuclease-free water, 4 μL of PCR buffer, 0.2 μL of 10mM dNTPs, 0.6 μL of DMSO, 1 μL of 10 μM forward primer, 1 μL of 10 μM reverse primer, and 0.2 μL of DNA polymerase (see Table of Materials).",
    "NOTE: Multiple primers can be used in a PCR reaction. For instance, one universal forward primer and two allele-specific reverse primers can be combined, as long as the two reverse primers are designed to generate PCR products of distinct sizes so that the presence/absence of the two alleles can be unambiguously determined by gel electrophoresis (see representative results section).\nRun agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the size and presence/absence of PCR products. Adjust the condition of agarose gel electrophoresis (e.g., agarose gel percentage, V/cm, and duration) depending on the expected size of PCR products.\nUse the results from PCR regarding the size and presence/absence of PCR products to assign a genotype to each post-surgery embryo. For instance, if different alleles are expected to generate PCR products of different sizes, use the size information to assign the genotype for each embryo. If allele-specific primers are used, the data on the presence/absence of PCR products should be used to assign a genotype to each embryo.\nSort embryos according to genotype.\nSubscription Required.
