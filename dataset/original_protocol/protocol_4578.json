    "Prepare the fixative by dissolving 0.4 g of paraformaldehyde powder in 10 ml of 20 mM sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4). Heat this solution in a fume hood on the hotplate/stirrer to approximately 70 °C until the solution clears completely, and allow it to cool. The fixative mixture should be prepared immediately before use.Cut the rice leaf blade into pieces measuring approximately 2-3 mm in length (Figure 1A) and immediately immerse it in the fixative (the cut tissue will float on the fixative).The tissue/fixative is placed in a desiccator, which is connected to a diaphragm vacuum pump. The tissue/fixative is vacuum degasified for 5 min at room temperature using the vacuum pump before releasing the vacuum very slowly. Pull and release the vacuum again until the tissue sinks. Incubate overnight at 4 °C without vacuum.Dissolve 5.0 g agar powder in 100 ml of PBS using a microwave oven. Place the molten agar medium on the hotplate/stirrer, which must be preheated to 60 °C. Remove the fixative. Rinse the tissue three times with PBS. Pour the tissue into a paraffin dish.Cover the paraffin dish with molten agar medium. Arrange the leaf blade tissue in a regular array (Figure 1B and Figure 2A). Allow the agar to solidify for at least 15 min (Figure 1C).Glue the agar block, in which pieces of cut leaf blade tissues were placed upright, onto the stage of a Leica VT1200S vibrating blade microtome with a drop of instant glue (Konishi Aron Alpha) (Figure 1D-E and Figure 2B).Cut the agar-embedded tissue transversely, set upright in the agar block, with a thickness of 70 μm with the vibroslicer (Figure 1F-H and Figure 2C). Collect the transverse sections in PBS by tweezers.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150928/20150928205538_1248.jpgFigure 1. Section preparation. A.

Rice leaf blade tissues are embedded in agar (A), and the agar block is glued on the stage of a Leica VT1200S vibrating blade microtome (B). The agar-embedded tissue is cut parallel to the surface of the stage (shown as dotted lines in C).Transfer the sections and incubate them in sequential dehydration treatments with 0.5 ml of 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% ethanol for 30 min in each solution without shaking.The sections are then transferred and incubated for 30 min in each step in increasing concentrations of benzene in ethanol, ranging from 10% up to 100% with 10% stepwise increases, until the solvent has been replaced with benzene.The benzene-equilibrated sections are stained with 0.1% crystal violet lactone solution for 10 min to visualize the silicified cells.Place the stained sections on a microscope slide and cover it gently with a cover slip. Seal the cover slip with nail polish.The sections are observed using an optical microscope and images are recorded using a CCD camera (Figure 2)."
