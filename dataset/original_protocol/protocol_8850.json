    "The use of animals and animal tissues should strictly adhere to ethical committee approval under local rules and regulation. All tissues obtained during this study adhered to the MRC-LMB's animal experimentation guidelines.\n1. Preparation of Materials & Culture Media\nPrepare all solutions using Millipore water; use only analytical grade reagents. Prepare and store all reagents at RT (unless indicated otherwise).\nMake 500 ml of HEPES-buffered saline (10 mM HEPES, 120 mM NaCl pH 7.2). Filter through a 0.2 µm sterile filter unit. Store at 4 °C.\nMake 500 ml of Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mM Na2HPO4, 2 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, pH 7.4). Sterilize by autoclaving.\nPrepare neuronal medium by supplementing DMEM (Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium) with 25 mM HEPES, 10% Fetal calf serum, 30 mM glucose, 1:100 N2 supplement, penicillin-streptomycin 1,100 U/ml; pH 7.2. Filter with a 0.2 µm sterile filter unit. Store at 4 °C.\nMake polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) stock solution with 20 mg PVP in 1 ml 100% Ethanol. Aliquot this into 1 ml amounts, freeze and store at -20 °C. Working solution is 0.05 mg/ml, therefore add 10 µl of PVP stock solution to every 4 ml of 100% ethanol.\nPrepare a 0.05 M spermidine stock solution in Millipore water; adjust the pH to 7.2.\nMake a 2% agarose solution in DMEM (2 g electrophoresis grade agarose in 100 ml DMEM in a sterilized screw cap bottle). Microwave this until the agarose has dissolved. Store in the 4 °C fridge for several weeks, if necessary.\n2. Preparation of Organotypic Slices",
    "Euthanize C57 Black 6 mice of the desired age by CO2 asphyxiation followed by decapitation. Remove the brain using lateral skull cuts starting at the foramen magnum and ending at the olfactory lobes. Gently lift the skull from the rear to expose the brain.\nCut between the olfactory lobes and the frontal cortex, and rostral to the cerebellum. Gently lift the rostral part of the brain and cut the optic nerves. Finally, remove the brain and place it in a petri dish filled with ice cold HEPES-buffered saline on ice.\nUsing a dissecting microscope, peel away the pia using fine forceps; carefully remove blood vessels and meninges around the brain.\nPlace the fresh brain into a small recipient mold and cover it with the agarose solution cooled to slightly above RT. Then rapidly cool the mold to 4 °C by placing it on ice.\n\tNOTE: Process the slices as rapidly as possible to avoid loss of viability.\nWhen the agarose has set (5 - 10 min), remove the agarose-embedded brain from the mold (trim if necessary), and then glue it to the vibroslicer platform. Place this into a vibroslicer chamber containing sterile ice cold PBS. Disinfect the vibroslicer chamber before being used with 70% ethanol to minimize subsequent contaminations.\nCut the brain using a custom built vibroslicer or commercial equivalent. The model concept was to design a tissue slicer that could generate large amplitude and high frequency movements horizontal to the edge of the blade while minimizing vertical vibrations.",
    "Use the oscillation frequency of 90 Hz, at an amplitude of 1.5 - 2.0 mm, and the cutting blade positioned at an angle of 15° to the horizontal plane; set the mounting block holding the agarose-embedded brain to move at 1.7 mm/min towards the blade. Collect sections (150 µm) into a chamber containing ice cold culture media (DMEM Pen/Strep + 10% FCS). View cutting and manipulation of the tissue slices as a supplementary video in Arsenault and O'Brien13.\nGently place the slices into cell culture inserts (0.4 µm, 30 mm diameter) in a 6 multi-well tray with the culture media on the outside of the insert, and incubate in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: For proper tissue viability, be extremely gentle while transferring and manipulating the slices. Also, too much fluid will prevent the organotypic slices from adhering to the membrane of the filter insert. If this happens, remove the excess fluid or plate again.\nAlthough organotypic slices can be cultured for a few weeks, proceed to transfection no later than 4 days after plating for best transfection yields.\n\tNOTE: To avoid glial overgrowth in long term culture conditions, use AraC or serum free medium2.\n3. Preparation of DNA-coated Micro & Nano-projectiles\nPrepare nano-projectiles using 40 nm diameter gold particles. Briefly, add 50 µl of 0.05 M spermidine and 10 µl DNA at 1 mg/ml (pEYFP-N1) to 10 mg of gold particles.\n\t\nAdd calcium and spermidine in the solution mixture during DNA-gold micro particles preparation in order to aid in the binding of DNA molecules to the gold nanoparticles.",
    "NOTE: The amount of DNA used per mg of gold carriers (DLR), should range between 1 and 5 µg DNA per 1 mg of gold. Furthermore, the amount of gold carrier particles that will be shot per cartridge (MLQ), should itself range from 0.1 to 0.5 mg of gold. The DLR and MLQ should be tried and optimized for each user depending on the particular system under investigation as well as the type of particle and gene gun used.\nMix using a vortex while slowly adding 50 µl of 1 M CaCl2 in fractions of 10 - 15 µl. Following 5 min of occasional vortexing, centrifuge at 1,000 x g for 30 sec then remove the supernatant. Resuspend the gold particle pellet in 3.5 ml of 0.075 M PVP.\nDraw this suspension into tubing (2.36 mm internal diameter) using a syringe. Place the tubing in the tubing preparation station. Allow the gold particles to settle and remove the supernatant by aspiration with a syringe. Rotate the tubing to evenly spread the gold particles, which were subsequently dried under a constant nitrogen flow at 5 L per min.\nTo create DNA-bullets, cut the tubing using a tubing cutter into 1 cm lengths. Either insert immediately into the gene gun cartridge or keep desiccated (4 °C) until required.\n4. Biolistic Transfection on Organotypic Slices\nPerform the following steps within a sterile laminar flow hood.\nInsert a 9 V battery and an empty cartridge holder into the Helios gene gun.\nAttach the gene gun to the helium tank with the helium hose. Fire 2 - 3 blanks (empty slots) at 50 psi to pressurize the helium hose and the reservoirs in the gun.\nLoad the cartridges containing the DNA-coated gold into the cartridge holders and load the holder into the gene gun.",
    "Unscrew the gene gun spacer and attach the modified gene gun barrel to the gene gun.\nUsing sterile forceps, place a filter insert containing the organotypic slice into a sterile plastic dish.\nRemove media from organotypic slices.\nSet the gas pressure at 50 psi.\n\tNOTE: Eye protection is essential and ear protection advisable.\nPlace the gene gun at the appropriate distances by using the mounting measured to 10 mm. Carefully aim the centre of the barrel over the desired region for genetic delivery.\nAfter firing, replace the inserts back into their dish with fresh media and return them to normal growth conditions, i.e., 37 °C with 5% CO2 incubator.\nOnce finished, close the helium tank, release the pressure from the gene gun and detach the gene gun from the helium tank.\nRemove the cartridge holder and discard the cartridges and clean the gene gun .\nCheck the tissue for morphology and for successful penetration by visualizing the slices using an inverted microscope. If using microparticles, evenly disperse the gold; there should be no dense areas of gold particles seen on the slice. Nanoparticles due to their small size can't be seen as single units by conventional microscopy techniques.\nAfter the appropriate time interval (usually 1 - 2 days), fix the slices in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for microscopy observation.\n\tNOTE: Fixing in PFA is not always desired. For live cell imaging avoid this step.\n5. Fixing and Visualization of Brain Slices\nAfter biolistic transfection, wash slices twice in PBS for 2 min.\nFix slices by incubating in freshly made, ice cold 4% PFA in PBS for 20 min.\nWash slices twice in PBS for 2 min.",
    "Gently cut round the membrane supports using a scalpel, without disturbing the slices mounted on them. Use forceps to place each membrane support/slice on a microscope slide. Rest the organotypic slices on top of the membrane on the glass slide.\nAdd one drop of mounting media on top of the slice and add a coverslip gently without any force directly in contact with the organotypic slice.\nSecure the coverslip with a thin layer of nail varnish.\nView the slices on an appropriate microscope.\n6. Confocal Applications\nVisualize the slices by using an upright scanning laser confocal microscope with a 60X/1.4 numerical aperture (NA) oil immersion objective lens.\n\tNOTE: The most problematic feature of the confocal microscope is the pinhole size (set at 1 AU) which is capable of isolating and collecting a plane of focus, thus eliminating the out of focus 'haze' normally seen with a fluorescent sample. Fine details are often obscured by this haze and cannot be detected in a nonconfocal microscope.\nSet the Argon laser to an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and optimize for collection of emitted light in the 500 to 520 nm band. Typically, collect images at 1,024 x 1,024 pixels and with stacks of z-sections at 0.5 μm intervals to encompass the full width of each nerve cell that was analyzed.\n\t\nTo observe the morphology of the nucleus, counter stain these cells with DAPI (excitation wavelength set at 405 nm and emission light collected between 420 - 4 40 nm). Finally, for examining red fluorescence, set the laser at 561 nm for excitation and 565 - 620 nm for emission.",
    "Typically, acquire images by using a 4X scan zoom that covered an area of 57.6 μm2; image sizes were in the region of 1,024 x 1,024 pixels. Record stacks of z-sections in 0.5 μm intervals and projections of 5 - 8 frames combined."
