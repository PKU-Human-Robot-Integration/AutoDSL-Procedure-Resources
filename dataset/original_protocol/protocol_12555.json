    "NOTE: The E. coli strain ACM5 was recovered by processing and culturing the fish sample for fecal coliform (FC) determination12. During the fish sampling, fish did not show clinical signs of disease, bacterial, or fungal infection, and a mean temperature of 22.3 °C prevailed. After isolation, the E. coli isolate was subjected to biochemical testing and cryopreserved in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth with DMSO (8% v/v) as a cryoprotective agent.\n1. Reactivation of frozen E. coli ACM5 stock culture\nFrom the frozen bacterial stock, open the tube and use a sterile loop, pipette tip, or toothpick to scrape the surface of the frozen bacterial culture.\nStreak the bacteria onto a Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plate and incubate at 37 ± 2 °C for 24 h.\n2. Determination of antibacterial susceptibility\nNOTE: The antimicrobial susceptibility testing described here corresponds to the disk diffusion method based on the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines (M02 Ed13:2018)31. E. coli ATCC 25922 strain is required for quality control purposes.\nInoculum preparation by colony suspension method\n\t\nFrom the LB plate incubated in step 1.2, streak one or two colonies onto a Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar plate and incubate at 37 ± 2 °C for 18-24 h.\nUse a sterile loop to pick two or three colonies from the freshly sub-cultured E. coli isolate on MH agar plate and resuspend them in 3 mL of sterile MH broth or 0.85% (w/v) saline solution, mixing thoroughly by vortexing to obtain a uniform bacterial suspension.",
    "Using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (see Table of Materials), adjust the bacterial suspension to turbidity comparable to a 0.5 MacFarland standard (equivalent to approximately 1-2 x 108 cells/mL). If the bacterial suspension is too light or too heavy, add more E. coli colonies or MH broth as appropriate. Use the prepared inoculum within 15 min of preparation.\nInoculation of the test agar plates\n\t\nDip a sterile cotton swab into the adjusted bacterial suspension. Rotate the swab several times and press it firmly on the inside wall of the tube to remove excess fluid from the swab.\nInoculate an MH agar plate by streaking the swab 3x over the entire agar surface, rotating the plate 60° each time. Swab the rim of the agar as well to ensure an even distribution of the inoculum.\nLeave the Petri dish lid ajar for 3-5 min to allow moisture to evaporate.\nApplication of the antimicrobial disk onto inoculated agar plates\n\t\nDistribute evenly and press each antimicrobial disk (see Table of Materials) down onto the surface of the inoculated agar plates to ensure complete contact. Invert the plates within 15 min after disk application and incubate at 35 ± 2 °C for 16-18 h.\n\t\tNOTE: A maximum of 12 and six disks must be used in Petri dishes of 150 mm and 100 mm, respectively.\nAfter incubation, measure the zone of inhibition sizes using a Vernier caliper and interpret the resulting diameters according to the CLSI breakpoint criteria (M100 - Table 2A)32.\n3. Genomic DNA (gDNA) extraction and quantification\nGenomic DNA extraction\n\t\nResuspend a loopful of freshly cultured E. coli colonies in 5 mL of LB broth and incubate overnight in a shaking incubator (180 rpm) at 37 ± 2 °C.",
    "Centrifuge the bacterial suspension at 3,500 x g for 5 min and carefully discard the supernatant.\nExtract gDNA following the DNA extraction kit guidelines (see Table of Materials).\nCheck the purity of the gDNA by measuring optical density at 260/280 nm (ratio: >1.8) and 260/230 nm (ratio: 2.0-2.2) using a UV-visible spectrophotometer. Perform 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis to verify the gDNA integrity.\nGenomic DNA quantification\n\tNOTE: Use only thin-wall, clear, 0.5 mL PCR tubes approved by the fluorescence assay kit manufacturer (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nSet up the required number of tubes for samples and assay standards. Prepare the working assay solution by mixing component A and component B provided in the kit, following the manufacturer's guidelines.\nPrepare the assay standards by adding 190 µL of the working solution and 10 µL of each standard to the appropriate tube (two standards are required).\nAdd 198 µL of the working solution and 2 µL of the DNA sample to the appropriate tube. Vigorously mix by vortexing all the tubes for 5 s. Be careful not to create bubbles.\nIncubate all tubes for 2 min at room temperature, protected from light. Measure the fluorescence of all tubes based on the manufacturer's guidelines using the fluorometer (see Table of Materials).\nProperly adjust the gDNA sample concentration for sequencing proceeding.\n4. DNA library preparation\nNOTE: DNA library preparation and sequencing were performed following the manufacturer's guidelines and protocols (see Table of Materials). The starting gDNA concentration is 4.0 ng.\nTagmentation, PCR amplification, and indexing\n\t\nIn a 0.2 mL tube, add 2.5 µL of tagmentation buffer and 2 µL of input gDNA (2.0 ng/µL). Mix gently by pipetting.\nAdd 1 µL of amplification buffer and mix gently by pipetting. Spin down at 280 x g for 1 min at room temperature.",
    "Place the samples in a thermocycler (see Table of Materials) and run the following PCR program: 55 °C for 5 min, then hold at 10 °C. When the samples reach 10 °C, proceed immediately to neutralize the reaction.\nAdd 1 µL of neutralizing buffer to the sample tubes and mix gently by pipetting. Spin down at 280 x g for 1 min and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nAdd 1.7 µL of each index adapter (i.e., indexes i7 and i5) and 3 µL of indexing PCR master mix. Mix gently by pipetting. Spin down at 280 x g for 1 min at room temperature.\nPlace the samples in the thermocycler and perform a second PCR reaction as follows: 72 °C for 3 min, 95 °C for 30 s, 18 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 5 min, and hold at 10 °C.\nAmplified library clean up\n\t\nMix by vortexing the commercial magnetic bead solution (see Table of Materials) based on the manufacturer's guidelines.\nTransfer the tagmented/indexed gDNA sample to a new 1.5 mL tube and add 0.6 µL of magnetic beads for each µL of the final volume of gDNA sample (≈13 µL). Mix gently by pipetting and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nPlace the sample tubes on a magnetic rack (see Table of Materials) for 2 min until the supernatant has cleared. Remove and discard the supernatant carefully without disturbing the beads.\nAdd 200 µL of freshly prepared 80% ethanol without mixing. Incubate for 30 s until the eluate clears and carefully remove and discard the supernatant without disturbing the beads.",
    "Perform a second wash step. Add 200 µL of 80% ethanol to the beads and incubate for 30 s. After the eluate clears, remove and discard the supernatant and air-dry the beads for 10 min.\nAdd 15 µL of 10 mM tris buffer (pH 8) to the beads and mix gently by pipetting. Incubate for 2 min at room temperature. Place the sample tubes again on the magnetic rack for 2 min, allowing the supernatant to clear.\nCarefully transfer 14 µL of the supernatant from the sample tube to a new 0.2 mL tube. This is the cleaned-up library.\n\t\tNOTE: At this point, the cleaned-up library can be stored at -20 °C for up to 7 days.\nLibrary normalization\n\t\nProceed to quantify the cleaned-up libraries by fluorescence assay as described in step 3.2, except for step 3.2.5.\nVisualize the cleaned-up libraries on a 1% agarose gel electrophoresis to determine the average fragment sizes.\nCalculate the molarity value of the library using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64404/64404eq01.jpg\nUsing the molarity value, calculate the proper volumes of resuspension buffer (RSB) and cleaned-up libraries to dilute the individual library at a starting concentration of 10 nM.\n5. Library pooling, denaturalizing, and sequencer initiating\nThaw the reagent cartridge following the manufacturer's directions. Extract the flow cell from the refrigerator (4 °C) and bring it to room temperature before sequencing.\nPool 5 µL of each normalized library (10 nM) into a low-bind 1.5 mL tube. Dilute the pooled library at 4 nM with the proper volume of RSB.",
    "Add 5 µL of the pooled library (4 nM) and 5 µL of 0.2 N NaOH in a new low-bind 1.5 mL tube. Briefly mix by vortexing, spin down at 280 x g for 1 min, and incubate for 5 min at room temperature to denature the pooled library into single strands.\nGently mix 10 µL of denatured pooled library and 990 µL of prechilled hybridization buffer by pipetting and place on ice until the final dilution for sequencer loading is performed. The concentration of the denatured pooled library is 20 pM.\nThaw and prepare a control library (see Table of Materials) at a concentration of 4 nM by mixing 2 µL of control library (10 nM) and 3 µL of nuclease-free water.\nMix 5 µL of the control library (4 nM) and 5 µL of freshly prepared 0.2 N NaOH. Briefly mix by vortexing, spin down at 280 x g for 1 min, and incubate for 5 min at room temperature to denature the control library into single strands.\nGently mix 10 µL of denatured control library and 990 µL of prechilled hybridization buffer by pipetting and place on ice until the final dilution for sequencer loading is done. The concentration of the denatured control library is 20 pM.\nIn a new low-bind 1.5 mL tube, combine 594 µL of the denatured pooled library at 20 pM and 6 µL of the denatured control library at 20 pM. Mix properly.\nDilute the final library mix (20 pM) to a final loading concentration of 1.2 pM in a volume of 600 µL using the prechilled hybridization buffer.",
    "Before loading the final library mix onto the reagent cartridge, perform an additional thermal pretreatment to achieve efficient loading into the flow cell. Incubate the final library mix for 2 min at 96 °C. Invert the tube to mix, and place the tube on ice for 5 min.\nLoad 500 µL of the final library mix into the designed reservoir on the reagent cartridge. Initiate sequencing following the guidelines. Load the flow cell and the reagent cartridge and set up the sequencing run.\n6. Sequence data analysis\nNOTE: Check Supplementary File 1 for further description of the general WGS data preprocessing, software, parameter settings, and sequence analysis of the E. coli genome.\nConnect to the sequencing data server and download the FASTQ files.\nEvaluate the initial quality of raw sequence data with third-party software. Remove remnant adapter sequences, low-quality bases (<Q30), and short reads (<50 bp) from the raw sequencing data (see Supplementary File 1).\nAssemble the quality-checked sequencing data into contig- or scaffold-level using third-party software (see Supplementary File 1).\nPerform genome annotation by submitting the FASTA file containing the assembled genome to the RAST server (https://rast.nmpdr.org/).\nUpload the FASTA file to the Center for Genome Epidemiology (CGE) (http://www.genomicepidemiology.org/services/) and ClermonTyping (http://clermontyping.iame-research.center/index.php) web platforms to identify epidemiological features, ARGs, VAGs, and plasmids (see Supplementary File 1).\nUpload the FASTA file to the PHASTER server to identify prophage sequences (https://phaster.ca/).\nSubscription Required.
