    "Preparation of Andean potato extracts and protein quantificationWash two mature potato tubers (stage five, according to Johnson, 2008) with distilled water. Peel, weigh (in our case 11.50 g) and dice them into small pieces of about 2 x 2 cm in size (see Figures 2A and 2B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161128/20161128190516_9380.jpgFigure 2. Preparation of potato extracts. A. Workflow followed to obtain the crude potato extract enriched in MCP inhibitors. B. Potato peeling and dicing. C. Mixing of the diced potatoes with the extraction buffer into the blender. D. The appearance of the potato extract before and after two centrifugation steps (from left to right).Mix the potato pieces with three volumes of ice-cold extraction buffer (in our case 34.50 ml; a mass/volume ratio of 1:3) into the cooled blender and homogenize at gentle speed for 5 min. (Figures 2A and 2C).Note: The homogenization should be performed in several sessions of 15-30 sec each, with 60 sec intervals between sessions to prevent excessive heating of the sample.After homogenization, transfer the potato homogenate to 50 ml tubes and centrifuge the sample at 9,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant to a clean 50 ml centrifuge tube and spin at 25,000 x g for 30 min at 4 °C (Figures 2A and 2D). After the second centrifugation step, collect the resultant supernatant and filter through a 0.45 μm syringe filter to eliminate protein aggregates. The resultant potato extract can be stored at -20 °C until analyzed.Determine the protein concentration of the samples using the Coomassie Plus Assay Kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, prepare a final volume of 500 μl of each of the six standard solutions containing 0, 2, 5, 10, 15 and 20 μg/ml of BSA and appropriate dilutions of the sample/s.",
    "Transfer 150 μl of each standard and potato extract samples into different wells of a 96-well microplate. BSA standards and potato extract samples should be assayed in triplicate. Then, add 150 μl of the Coomassie Plus reagent (see Materials and Reagents section) to each well and mix using the micropipette, by pipetting up and down carefully. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, measure the absorbance at 595 nm using a UV-Vis microplate spectrophotometer. Typically, we obtained 1-2 mg/ml of protein in the extracts.Enzymatic assaysDetermination of bCPA specific inhibitory activity Prepare triplicates of the reaction mixtures (Table 1) in a microplate without adding the substrate. Calculate the volume of potato extract to be added, in order to obtain 20% to 80% of bCPA inhibition. To obtain these inhibition levels, we typically add around 5-30 μg/ml of final protein concentration to the assay.Table 1. Reaction mixtureimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161128/20161128191816_1281.jpgWhere X is the volume (in μl) of potato extract to be assayed. The substrate should be added immediately before plate reading (see step B1c below)Cover the microplate with a lid and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.Add 25 μl of substrate working solution to each well, mix carefully and thoroughly, by pipetting up and down carefully with a multichannel micropipette (A graphical demonstration of steps B1a, B1b and B1c is shown in Video 1). Note: the homogenization should be performed in no longer than 60 sec, to avoid significant consumption of the substrate before absorbance monitoring. Perform absorbance measurements at 340 nm every 30 sec for 10 min.One unit of inhibitory activity is defined as the amount of inhibitor able to reduce one unit of bCPA activity, which in turn corresponds to the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1.0 μmol of N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-Phe-OH per min at 25 °C.",
    "Consequently, Equation 1 can be used to calculate the Specific Inhibitory Activity (SIA) found in potato extracts.Equation 1:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161128/20161128193843_1035.jpgWhere,IA is the Inhibitory Activity in U/ml, ΔAbs/Δt is the absorbance variation per unit of time (in min) during the reaction in absence (control), and in presence of the potato extract (Potato ext), respectively,ξ is the extinction coefficient for the substrate N-(4-methoxyphenylazoformyl)-Phe-OH (ξ 350 nm = 19 [μmoles/ml]-1 cm-1), Vtotal is the assay volume and VPotato ext is the volume of extract added to the reaction, D and L are the dilution factor for the extract and the path length (in cm), respectively. Typically, the path length in a microplate for a volume of 250 μl is 0.7 cm. However, for different reaction volumes, or for a more accurate calculation, check your 96-well microplate manufacturer instructions.Then, calculate directly the SIA by dividing the resultant IA value by the protein concentration of the sample in mg/ml (see Equation 2 and examples in Table 2).Equation 2:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161128/20161128194353_0448.jpg Determination of the IC50: Dose-Response curve assay (see Figure 3)Prepare the same control reaction as described in step B1a and prepare at least 12 additional reaction mixtures with different final concentrations of the potato extract in the assay, ranging from 0 to 300 μg/ml, (or even with higher concentration to obtain the complete inhibition of bCPA activity).Note: We typically assay a total of 15 different extract final concentrations, containing 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 μg/ml of protein.Fit the results obtained to the following Equation 3 and determine the IC50 value. Equation 3:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161128/20161128194605_2395.jpgWhere,X is the log-transformed protein concentration assayed, Y is the normalized bCPA activity (relative to the control condition and expressed as a percentage of the maximal activity).",
    "Y values can be calculated for each extract concentration, using the following Equation 4.Equation 4:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161128/20161128194803_3161.jpgThe IC50 value is the extract concentration necessary to reach a 50% of bCPA inhibition (Copeland, 2005). See representative examples of dose-response bCPA inhibitory plots in Figure 3 and the corresponding IC50 values in Table 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161128/20161128194936_0426.jpgFigure 3.
