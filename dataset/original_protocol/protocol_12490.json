    "All procedures are conducted in accordance with the Weill Cornell Medical College Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee rules.\n1. Preparation and Setup for Stereotaxic Delivery of Viral Vectors\nIf an instrument, sterile swab, or hand wearing sterile glove is contaminated by coming into contact with a non-sterile surface, discard or re-sterilize the instrument using a hot bead sterilizer, discard the swab or change to new sterile gloves.\nPlace a mouse cage with bedding on a heat block to warm for post-operative recovery.\nSet up electric razor for shaving head and ethanol and iodine to sterilize the scalp.\nWipe down ear bars and mouth hold of the stereotax with 70% ethanol.\nUsing a 5 μl Hamilton syringe, draw up 5 μl of viral vector (1 x 106 viral particles/μl) and set up in syringe holder on stereotax.\nMicrowave heating pad or turn electric pad on and place on stereotax. Cover with a clean absorbent pad to reduce the risk of burns. Monitor mouse body temperature (between 97-99.5 °F) frequently throughout procedure. \nInject mouse (weighing between 22-35 g) with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg). Once a mouse is anesthetized, pinch tail tip to check the mouse's reflexes and note any movement or response to ensure that the mouse is adequately anesthetized.\nShave head between ears and eyes.\nClean shaved head with alternating ethanol and iodine sterile cotton applicators.\nTransfer mouse to heated pad on stereotax.\n2. Stereotaxic Microinjection of Viral Vectors\nWear sterile gloves throughout the surgery. If gloves are contaminated at any point by touching non-sterile surfaces, change gloves.\nZero tooth bar and ear bar scales.\nSet teeth in tooth bar.",
    "Screw in muzzle. If wiggling or whisker movement is noted at any time, administer an i.p. booster dose (~0.05 cc) of a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (20 mg/kg).\nScrew in ear bars.\nLubricate eyes with PuraLube.\nCut open scalp to just behind ears with a scalpel.\nPlace bulldog clips on the corners of the scalp to peel the skin away from skull. Bregma and lambda should be easily visible.\nMake sure suture from bregma to lambda is aligned straight. If the suture is crooked readjust positioning of the head.\nCheck to make sure all settings on the stereotax are zeroed.\nPut needle tip in place at bregma.\nMeasure all coordinates for both bregma and lambda. This includes dorsal/ventral, medial/lateral and anterior/posterior coordinates.\nAdjust the head until the ventral coordinates for bregma and lambda are within 0.02 mm of each other.\nOnce aligned, from bregma go medially out to the medial/lateral (M/L) coordinates. Make sure the left and right sides are aligned within 0.02 mm of each other.\nRe-center needle tip on bregma and from there move in the anterior/posterior (A/P) direction to the desired anterior/posterior coordinate.\nIf necessary, angle needle in one direction and make sure the stereotax is locked. Go out to the left M/L coordinate (+/- 1.52)\nMeasure the ventral position of the top of the skull to use as a reference after the borehole is drilled.\nDrill a borehole using a sterile drill bit at the desired coordinate. Check that the needle can enter uninterrupted through the skull.\nLower the needle to the desired ventral coordinate.\nOnce the coordinate is reached, dip 0.015 mm below for ~10 sec to create a small pocket for the viral vector.",
    "Inject the desired volume of viral vector at a rate of ~0.1 μl/min. Wait 3 min for viral vector to diffuse completely. Raise the needle tip 0.015 mm and wait an additional 2 min.\nDip the needle (if doing angled injections) in the opposite direction. Again, record the ventral position as a reference for the top of the skull.\nRepeat the same steps as on the first side to inject viral vector on the opposite side (if doing bilateral injections).\nApply bone wax to both holes to seal them using the wooden end of a sterile cotton applicator tip.\nSuture the scalp.\nApply nerve block to the wounded area.\nRemove mouse from stereotax and place in warmed cage on heat block to recover for 45 min.\nMonitor for signs of pain including: decreased overall activity or restlessness, decreased food and water consumption or increased vocalization. Buprenorphine (0.05 - 0.2 mg/kg) can be administered twice daily for a week if necessary for pain. Acceptable alternatives include: meperidine (20-60 mg/kg), pentazocine (10 mg/kg), nalbuphine (4-8 mg/kg).\n3. Conditioned Place Preference: Acquisition, Extinction, and Reinstatement\nPlace mice into the central chamber of a three-chamber place preference apparatus (Med Associates Inc., St. Albans, VT, USA) for a 60 sec habituation period with guillotine doors closed.\nAfter habituation, open guillotine doors and allow mice free exploration of all 3 chambers for 1,200 sec, with time spent in each chamber being recorded using MedPC IV software (Med Associates, Inc.).\nAssign mice to conditioning chambers based on their performance during the pre-test. Using a biased design, pair drug administration during the subsequent 3 days with the compartment that was least-preferred during the baseline pre-test.",
    "During the next 3 conditioning days, inject mice with cocaine (10 mg/kg; i.p.) during the morning session and confine them in their assigned chamber for 1,200 sec immediately following the injection. Return mice to their home cages after the session. After 4 hr, inject mice with saline (0.01 ml/g body weight) and confine them to the opposite chamber for the 1,200 sec afternoon session.\nTo test for acquisition, place mice in the central chamber with guillotine doors closed for a 60 sec habituation period. Open guillotine doors and allow free exploration for 1,200 sec, with time spent in all chambers recorded by MedPC IV software (Med Associates, Inc.). Calculate preference by subtracting the amount of time spent in the saline-paired chamber from the amount of time spent in the cocaine-paired chamber.\nTo extinguish the place preference, expose mice to two 20 min sessions of free exploration daily in the same apparatus, separated by at least 2 hr, beginning 24 hr following the test for acquisition. Time spent in all chambers should again be recorded and the magnitude of the initial CPP should be compared with that of each extinction session.\nDetermine whether mice have extinguished the drug-induced preference by assessing whether preference for a particular chamber across two consecutive extinction days is significantly lower compared to the acquisition preference score.\nReinstate mice with a priming dose of cocaine (5 or 10 mg/kg; i.p.) and re-expose to the apparatus allowing free exploration and record the time spent in each compartment.\nAdminister Euthasol euthanasia solution (150 mg/kg). Transcardially perfuse mice with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and perform a histological examination to validate correct microinjection placement.\nSubscription Required.
