    "1. Polyurethane (PU) Sponge Preparation as Template\nUse PU sponges to produce hydroxyapatite templates containing interconnecting pores. Use each sponge to provide the primary trabeculae for the formation of the template struts as well as the formation of micro-channels within the trabeculae.\nCut and trim 80 ppi (pores per inch) sponges into 2 bridge-shapes with dimensions of 3.5 cm in height x 5 cm in length x 1.5 cm in width.\n\tNote: The dimensions and shapes can be chosen according to the desired primary pore size: 100 ppi, 80 ppi, and 60 ppi.\nMake a 100 ml of 4% (w/v) NaOH solution using a 150 ml beaker; then immerse and squeeze until the prepared sponges are completely soaked.\nAfter soaking, place the beaker with the sponges in the ultrasonicator (42 kHz).\nUltrasonically pre-treat the PU sponges for 15-20 min without heat to modify the surface properties.\nRinse with distilled water for 5-10 min. While rinsing, squeeze the sponges and allow them to expand 5 to 7 times in order to remove the residual NaOH inside the sponges.\nSqueeze the sponges with paper towels in order to remove excess water; then dry them in an oven at 60-80 °C.\n2. Hydroxyapatite (HA) Slurry Preparation for Coating\nBefore making the HA slurry, measure the weight of a beaker with a magnetic stir bar. This measurement will be used to calculate the powder/liquid ratio.\nMeasure 10 g of the nano-sized HA powder.\nAdd 20 ml of distilled water into the 50 ml beaker. Heat for 120-140 °C and stir using a hot plate magnetic stirrer.\nAdd 0.3 g (3% w/w) of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (89,000-98,000 MW) per powder into distilled water while stirring at 300-400 rpm.",
    "Stir until the PVA has completely dissolved. The solution should be clear after complete dissolution of the PVA.\nTurn off the heat and add 0.1 g (1% w/w) of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) (ultra-low viscosity) for powder while stirring at 400-500 rpm. The solution should be clear after complete dissolution of the PVA.\nStir until the CMC has completely dissolved and cool down to RT.\nAdd 0.3 g (3% w/w) of ammonium polyacrylate dispersant per powder while stirring at 300-400 rpm. Stir until completely dissolved.\nAdd 0.2 g (2% w/w) of glycerin per powder while stirring at 300-400 rpm. Stir until completely dissolved.\nSlowly disperse the HA powder into the solution while stirring at 600-900 rpm and keep stirring for 5 min.\nSonicate for 5 min using an ultrasonicator to ensure dispersion of any agglomeration of the HA powder.\nAdd an extra 5 ml of distilled water into the mixture while stirring at 600-900 rpm and heat at 90-100 °C.\nKeep stirring the mixture using a magnetic stirrer at 600-800 rpm at 90-100 °C in order to evaporate the water content.\nMeasure the whole weight including the beaker and mixture from time to time until a powder/liquid ratio of 1.75-1.8 is obtained.\nFormatting the powder/liquid ratio, divide the weight of the powder by the total weight of the mixture (2.14), including the powder, reagents, and water, minus the weight of the beaker and stirrer (2.1), and minus the HA powder (2.2).\n\tNote: For example: If A (entire mixture including powder, reagents, and water) is 49.05 g, B (beaker with stirrer) is 33.5 g, and then C (HA powder) is 10 g.\n\tC/(A-B-C) = 10/(49.05-33.5-10) = 1.80\nAllow the slurry to cool down to RT before using for coating.\n3. HA coating, Drying, and Sintering",
    "Coat the prepared PU sponges with the HA coating slurry using a stainless spatula until the slurry is homogenously distributed throughout the PU sponge onto a glass plate.\n\tNote: After removing the excess slurry, some of pores may still be clogged with slurry because of the high slurry viscosity.\nIn order to ensure interconnectivity, uniformity, and open pores, slightly blow the HA coated templates using an air compressor. This process ensures that the templates are homogeneously coated both on the inside and outer surfaces of the PU sponge.\n\tNote: If a homogeneous coating is not achieved, the HA coated templates will collapse during the sintering process and may also crack while handling due to low mechanical strength. Additionally, the homogeneous coating is critical in creating micro-channels within the trabeculae.\nDry the HA coated templates for a minimum of 5 hr under cooling conditions (20-25 °C) with gentle air circulation. However, extend the drying time based on the size of template.\n\tNote: After drying, the HA coated templates will typically shrink approximately 8% to 10% in each dimension.\nAfter the drying process, place the HA coated templates on an alumina crucible. Then, place them in a high temperature furnace and use the following 8 step sintering profile.\n\t\nHeat 2 °C/min until 230 °C.\nHeat 1 °C/min until 280 °C.\nHeat 0.5 °C/min until 400 °C.\nHeat 3 °C/min until 600 °C. Keep at 600 °C for 1 hr.\nHeat 5 °C/min until 1230 °C. Keep 1,230 °C for 3 hr.\nCool 5 °C/min to RT.\n\t\tNote: Sintering will further shrink the HA coated sponge templates by approximately 22% – 25% in each dimension.\n4. Ingress and Inhabitancy of Cells into Template",
    "Culture pre-osteoblastic MC3T3 cells in a non-osteogenic media consisting of α-MEM, supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotics (streptomycin and penicillin) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.\nAdd 10 ml of a cell suspension at 2 x 106 cell density into a single well within a 6-well plate.\nPlace the 3 cm x 4 cm x 1 cm bridge-shaped template vertically into the 6-well plate. Place one leg of the template into the plate containing the cell suspension, and the other leg into an adjacent empty well.\nAllow the template to absorb the cell suspension for 10 min.\nAdd 5 ml of media thereafter to the well that was originally filled with the cell suspension.\nReplenish the medium in both wells every 2 or 3 days until 7 days have elapsed.\nDetermine the efficacy of cell mobility by hematoxylin and eosin staining11.\n\t\nFix the cells and scaffold by immersing in 100% EtOH for 20-30 min.\nStain with Hematoxylin for 1-2 min.\nRinse with distilled water for 1-2 min for twice.\nDehydrate by immersion in 70%, then 95%, then 100% EtOH for 1-2 min each.\nStain with Eosin for 20-30 sec.\nRinse with distilled water for 12 min for twice.\nDehydrate by immersion in 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% EtOH for 1-2 min each.\nEmbed the scaffold in an acrylic resin for sectioning and imaging.\nDetermine the cell viability with the 3-[4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell viability assay and Live/Dead assay (Live/dead cell staining kit MPTP) at time points of day 3 and 711.\n\tNote: The scheme of bone-like template fabrication protocols are represented in the “Representative Results” session."
