    "1. Solid sample preparation\nCrush approximately 5 g of the sample to be analyzed, using a mortar and pestle, so that 100% of the crushed sample passes through a U. S. Standard Sieve mesh size No. 200 (i.e., 74 µm) making sure that the powder is well mixed.\nDetermine the moisture content of the powder gravimetrically.\n\t\nWeigh an aluminum weigh boat and record the mass (Wwb).\nTransfer approximately 2 g of sample powder into the weigh boat and record the mass (Wws+wb).\nPlace the weigh boat in a drying oven for 24 h at 102 °C (do not exceed 102 °C). After 24 h, remove the weigh boat from drying oven and place in a desiccator to cool for at least 1 h.\nWeigh and record the mass of the weigh boat and dried sample powder (Wds+wb).\nDetermine the moisture content using formula 1.1.\n\t\tFormula 1.1 Moisture content of solid sample powder\n\t\t​% moisture = (((Wws+wb- Wwb) – (Wds+wb - Wwb))/ (Wws+wb - Wwb)) * 100\n2. Extraction procedure\nSolid samples\n\t\nWeigh approximately 2.5 g of the sieved sample powder (Wsamp) into a plastic or aluminum weigh boat and record the weight to four decimal places.\nLoad the sample into a 1 L graduated cylinder and fill the cylinder to 1 L with 0.1 M NaOH (4 g NaOH x L-1).\nAdd a magnetic stir bar (e.g., 5 - 7 cm in length) and stir rapidly (i.e., 300 – 400 rpm) on a stir plate until the sample is thoroughly mixed.\nTransfer the entire contents of the graduated cylinder into a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask, evacuate the headspace of the flask with N2 gas and cover the flask opening with an airtight cover.",
    "Place the Erlenmeyer flask on a stir plate and mix at 300 - 400 rpm for 16 - 18 h.\nLiquid samples\n\t\nFor liquid materials, thoroughly mix the sample by shaking to ensure that the test liquid is mixed homogeneously. Make sure any residue that may have fallen to the bottom of the container is thoroughly mixed.\nAdd approximately 5 g of the test liquid, weighed to 4 decimal places (WTL), to a 1 L graduated cylinder.\nFill the graduated cylinder with 0.1 M NaOH to a final volume of 1 L.\nAdd a magnetic stir bar (e.g., 5 – 7 cm in length) and stir rapidly (e.g., 300 - 400 rpm) on a stir plate until the test sample is completely mixed.\nTransfer the mixture into a 1 L Erlenmeyer flask, evacuate the headspace with N2 gas and cover the flask opening with an airtight cover.\nPlace the Erlenmeyer flask on a stir plate and mix at 300 - 400 rpm for 1 h.\n\t\tNOTE: After this point, the handling of solid and liquid samples is the same.\n3. Removal of nonsoluble materials from alkaline extracts\nAt the completion of stirring, remove the flask from the stir plate, transfer the mixture to suitable centrifuge tubes and centrifuge the entire volume at 4,921 x g for 30 min.\nCollect the alkaline supernatant containing the HA and FA in a clean 1 L Erlenmeyer flask containing a magnetic stir bar. Discard the insoluble material. Filtration through glass wool or qualitative 2.5 µm pore size filter paper is recommended if residual particles are not precipitated after centrifugation.\n4. Precipitation and separation of HA from FF",
    "While stirring the alkaline extract at 300 - 400 rpm on a stir plate, insert a pH probe into the middle portion of the solution (vertically) and add conc. HCl dropwise to the alkaline extract until a stable pH of pH 1.0 ± 0.1 is reached.\nOnce a pH of pH 1 is reached and remains stable, remove the pH probe from the flask, retrieve the stir bar, cover the flask with an airtight cover and let the flask sit until the precipitated HA has settled to the bottom of the flask.\n\tNOTE: The time it takes a HA to precipitate and drop out of solution will vary depending on the source and amount of HA in the sample. It typically takes 1 -6 h for the HA to fully precipitate and drop out of solution.\nCentrifuge the extract and precipitated HA at 4921 x g for 1 h. After centrifugation, pour off the supernatant FF into a clean 1 L Erlenmeyer and cover with an airtight cover.\n\tNOTE: A longer centrifuge time may be necessary in order to pack the HA down firmly enough to allow decanting the FF without inclusion of any of the precipitated HA.\nPlace the centrifuge tubes in a drying oven held at 100 °C for 24 h.\nAfter drying, remove the tubes from the drying oven and place in a desiccator to cool to room temperature. After cooling, quantitatively transfer the residue from the tube by scraping it from the sides and bottom of the tube with a spatula, transfer to a tared weigh boat, and record the mass (WEHA). This residue is the “Extracted HA”.",
    "NOTE: If centrifuge tubes greater than 50 mL have been used in the separation of HA and FF, it is convenient to transfer the precipitated HA to temperature resistant 50 mL centrifuge tubes for the drying process. Also, if a freeze dryer is available the precipitated HA can be freeze dried. Collection of the HA in a freeze-dried state is easier because the HA does not stick to the side of the plastic tubes and does not have to be scrapped.\n5. Determination of ash content\nNOTE: The procedure for determination of ash content of dried HA and FA samples is the same. The procedure using notation for HA is shown.\nTransfer approximately 30 mg of the dried HA (WHA) to a clean, pre-weighed ceramic dish (WCD) that had been previously dried in a drying oven at 100 °C and then cooled in a desiccator to room temperature. After recording the combined mass of the weighted HA and dish (WHA+CD), combust the HA in a muffle oven for 2 h at 600°C.\n\tNOTE: For each HA sample, three replicates should be processed and the average ash content used in the calculation of pure HA.\nAfter 2 h, remove the dish and contents from the muffle oven and place in a desiccator to cool. Once cool, weigh the dish with ash (WASH+CD) and calculate the ash ratio (Ashrat) using formula 1.2:\n\tFormula 1.2 Ashrat = (WASH+CD - WCD) / (WHA+CD - WCD)\n6. Determination of the percentage of purified extracted HA\nDetermine the final mass of the pure HA (WPHA) by correcting for ash content using Formula 1.3:\n\tFormula 1.3 WPHA = WEHA * (1- Ashrat)\n7. Determination of the concentration (%) of pure HA in the original source sample\nDetermine the concentration of pure HA using Formula 1.4 and 1.5:",
    "Formula 1.4: % pure HA in solid sample = (WPHA/Wsamp) * 100\n\tFormula 1.5: % pure HA in liquid sample = (WPHA/WTL) * 100\n8. Column preparation for HFA purification\nPrepare a low-pressure chromatography column packed with polymethylmethacrylate DAX-8 resin. If the resin has not been used previously, soak the resin in methanol for 2 h and then rinse thoroughly with deionized H2O until all the methanol is removed.\n\t\nRemove small resin particles that float on the water at this time. If the resin has been used previously, regenerate it as described in section 10.\nOnce thoroughly rinsed, pour the resin into a 5 x 25 cm glass chromatography column fitted with an end piece with a 10 µm frit for resin bed support. Leave 2.5 to 5 cm at top of column for resin-free solution to enable mixing of the FF prior to entering the resin bed. Fit the top piece to the column and pump deionized H2O through the top of the column to pack the DAX-8 resin bed by using a peristaltic pump.\n9. Isolation of HFA\nOnce the resin bed is packed, load the FF onto the column using a peristaltic pump, under low pressure, via the top of the column. Use a flow rate of 35 – 40 mL/min. It is critical that the top of the resin in the column remains covered with solution throughout the entire loading and rinsing procedure to prevent drying of the resin and channeling of the extract though the resin bed.",
    "Once the fulvic fraction has been completely loaded onto the resin, wash the resin with deionized water, to remove the non-adsorbed “hydrophilic fulvic fraction” (HyFF) by pumping it through the top of the column using the peristaltic pump under low pressure. Use a flow rate of 35 – 40 mL/min. Discard the HyFF-containing effluent unless it will be used for analysis.\nWash the column with deionized H2O until the absorbance at 350 nm of the column effluent is equal (e.g., within 0.015 absorbance units) to that of the deionized H2O used to wash the column. Use deionized water to zero (i.e., blank) the spectrophotometer.\nDesorb the HFA by back elution by pumping 0.1 M NaOH via the bottom of the column using the peristaltic pump. Use a flow rate of 35 – 40 mL/min. Capture the pump effluent (the Na-fulvate in a clean sufficiently sized container (e.g., 2 L Erlenmeyer).\n\tNOTE: Most of the HFA adsorbs to the very top of the DAX-8 resin bed. Desorption by introducing the 0.1 M NaOH from the bottom of the column minimizes the amount of 0.1 M NaOH needed to fully desorb the FA.\nAll the HFA has been desorbed when the absorbance of the column effluent is equal to the absorbance of 0.1 M NaOH influent at 350 nm. Use 0.1 M NaOH as the spectrophotometric blank. Add the effluent taken to check absorbance of the desorbed FA solution to ensure all FA is captured.\n10. HFA de-ashing by protonation",
    "Pass the Na-fulvate solution, repeatedly, by gravity feed, through strong cation H+- exchange resin (Table of Materials) contained in a 5 × 50 cm column, with glass frit to retain the resin, until the electrical conductivity of the effluent is <120 µS/cm, as measured with an electrical conductivity meter. Prior to each pass, the H+-exchange resin requires refurbishment as described in Section 11.\n\t\nTo ensure that all the FA is removed from the resin after the final pass, wash the resin with deionized water until the absorbance of effluent at 350 nm is the same (e.g., within 0.015 absorbance units) as the deionized water used to wash the column. Use deionized H2O as the spectrophotometric blank. Add the wash and any effluent portions taken to check absorbance to the purified FA solution. To help with removal of all FA, the resin can be agitated (e.g., using a long glass or plastic rod) several times.\nConcentrate the FA to a volume of approximately 15 ± 2 mL by using a rotary evaporator at 55 °C.\nCompletely transfer the 15 mL FA concentrate to a 50 mL plastic centrifuge tube and dry at 60±3 °C to constant dryness in a drying oven. Freeze-drying is an alternative to oven drying. After drying transfer the tube to a desiccator to cool.\n\t\nRemove FA from the tube by scraping the tube sides and bottom with a spatula and weigh the collected FA on pre-tared weigh paper. This material is the “Extracted FA” (WEFA).",
    "Determine the ash ratio (ASHrat) of extracted FA as described under Step 6 for HA and calculate the ash ratio using Formula 1.2. Determine the weight of the extracted FA without ash (WPFA) using Formula 1.3, substituting the WEFA for weight of WEHA. Finally determine the % pure FA in the sample using Formula 1.4 substituting WPFA for WPHA.\n11. DAX-8 resin regeneration\nRegenerate the DAX-8 resin by pumping 0.1 M HCl (8.33 mL concentrated HCl/1000 mL final volume deionized H2O) at a flow rate of 35 – 40 mL/min through the bottom of the column until the pH of the effluent is equal to the pH of the influent. Use the peristaltic pump to pump all reagents through the DAX-8 column during regeneration.\nRinse the column with DI water by pumping it into the top of the column until the pH of the effluent equals the pH of the influent (i.e., DI water).\n12. H+-cation exchange resin regeneration\nRegenerate the H+ cation exchange resin in a batch process by pouring the resin into a large beaker (e.g., 4 L plastic beaker), rinse several times by covering the resin with DI H2O, mixing and then pouring off the water.\nCover the resin with 1 M HCl (83.3 mL concentrated HCl/1000 mL final volume DI water). Let stand for a minimum of 2 h with occasional stirring (e.g., once every 30 min).\nRemove the excess acid from the resin by pouring off the acid and covering the resin with DI water. Stir vigorously with a stirring rod for 15 s, then let the resin drop to the bottom of the flask and then pour off the water. Repeat the process until the electrical conductivity of the rinse water is ≤ 0.7 µS/cm.",
    "Load the regenerated resin back into the column. Cover with deionized H2O to make sure the resin remains wet between uses."
