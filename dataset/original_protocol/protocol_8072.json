    "1. Generation of transgenic flies\nTo generate transgenic flies for this experiment, collect OK371-Gal425 virgin female flies and males of UAS-TDP-43M337V 26 (Figure 1A) by anesthetizing flies with CO2 on a pad to sort.\nSort anesthetized flies into vials with standard Drosophila media for the cross. Place labeled vials at 25 °C for the next generation to emerge.\n\tNOTE: Clear the adults from the vials before the progeny emerge to ensure the proper genotype.\nOnce progeny emerge, collect the transgenic flies into vials and sort by sex to begin aging for experimental conditions.\nOnce flies are collected, transfer flies to fresh food every 2 days until the flies are 21 days old.\n2. Dissection prep\nTo prepare for dissections, obtain room temperature phosphate buffered saline (1x PBS), a 10 cm dissection dish coated with a silicone elastomer, straight edge dissecting scissors, one set of blunt dissection forceps, a P200 pipette and pipette tips, 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tubes, standard office scissors, 70% ethanol, a 6 cm Petri dish, and 32% formaldehyde diluted to 4% with 1x PBS.\nLabel tubes for each genotype or condition and add 900 µL of 1x PBS (room temp) and 150 µL of 32% formaldehyde to each tube. Wear gloves and safety glasses when preparing the 4% formaldehyde fixative.\nAnesthetize 6‒10 flies per group directly from the vial with CO2 and submerge flies into a 6 cm Petri dish with 70% ethanol. Press flies down into the ethanol using a paint brush to ensure that specimens are fully submerged. This will remove the layer of oil on the outer cuticle.\n3. Thorax isolation and fixation\nBefore dissecting each specimen, add approximately 7‒10 mL of 1x PBS to the dissection dish coated with silicone elastomer. This volume should ensure that the tissue samples are completely submerged.",
    "Transfer one fly to the dissection dish from the 70% ethanol using blunt forceps and grasping either the wings or the legs.\nFocus the sample in the dissection dish under a dissecting microscope. Next submerge the sample in 1x PBS, and carefully remove the wings using blunt Dumont #5 fine forceps.\nUsing Vannas straight edge spring dissection scissors, remove the legs by creating a small incision in the ventral side of the cuticle. In step 3.8, this incision will allow the formaldehyde to penetrate the tissue.\nTake the scissors in one hand and hold the forceps in the other to position the fly ventral side up. While holding the specimen in place with the blunt forceps, remove the head and abdomen with the dissection scissors.\nTransfer the isolated thorax using the modified pipette tip into the labeled tube, from step 3.2.\n\tNOTE: Set the pipette to 40 µL to avoid adding extra 1x PBS to the fixative.\nRepeat steps 3.2‒3.6 above for each specimen.\nFix samples for 30 min at room temperature.\nRemove the fix using a Pasteur pipette and discard it in the proper waste container under the fume hood. Rinse samples three times with 1.5 mL of 1x PBS each using a Pasteur pipette. Complete a fourth rinse using only 750 µL and leave tissues in 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: At this point, tissue samples can remain at 4 °C for up to 3 days before proceeding to the next steps.\n4. Flash freezing and thorax bisection\nBefore beginning the bisections, fill a Dewar flask with liquid nitrogen wearing proper cryo-protective gloves and safety glasses. Obtain a blade breaker, feather blades, one pair of fine forceps, ice, ice-cold 1x PBS, and cryogenic tweezers.\nPrepare an ice bucket to keep 1x PBS ice-cold.",
    "Use the blade breaker to grab the feather blade at an angle, and bend the blade in order to break off a small piece. The blade breaker can then lock the blade in position for use as a small scalpel.\n\tNOTE: One blade should last for all groups. Switch if blade breaks or becomes dull.\nAdd a clean pipette tip to the P200 and remove 1/5th of the tip to transport samples.\nPrepare a new microcentrifuge tube for each group and add 200 µL of 1x PBS to each tube. This second tube will be used to collect the final DLM preps.\nRemove all 1x PBS from tubes using a Pasteur pipette.\nWearing proper protective equipment, submerge the tube into the liquid nitrogen flask for 10 s with the cryogenic tweezers.\n\tNOTE: The tubes should be closed tightly to keep the tube from exploding.\nRemove the tube from the liquid nitrogen and add approximately 300 µL of ice-cold 1x PBS to the samples with a Pasteur pipette. Keep the samples on ice.\nAdd ice-cold 1x PBS to the 10 cm dissection dish coated with silicone elastomer and dispense the first thorax with the modified 200 µL pipette.\nPlace the thorax ventral side up. In one hand use a dull pair of forceps to position the thorax and in the other use a fine pair of forceps to remove some of the thoracic ganglion to expose the midline of the thorax.\nUse the midline of the thorax as a guide to make a shallow cut through 1/3rd of the thorax with the blade.\nRemove the blade from the thorax and position the thorax at a 45° angle with the blunt forceps. Reinsert the blade and cut straight down the midline of the thorax. This will result in two hemithoraces.",
    "Take one hemithorax at a time and remove the excess tissue under DLM muscle fiber F (Figure 1B), the most ventral fiber. Use the blade to carefully make one or two cuts to remove the excess tissue without damaging the DLMs.\nOnce isolated, transfer the hemithorax to the correct tube with 1x PBS.\nRepeat steps 4.6‒4.14 until 10 dissected hemithoraces per group are made.\n5. Structural staining\nAfter bisecting the thorax samples, place the tissue in blocking buffer (1x PBS with 0.1% normal goat serum, and 0.2% Triton X-100 at pH 7.4) to permeabilize the tissue and prevent non-specific staining. Use a Pasteur pipette to remove excess 1x PBS and add 1.5 mL of blocking buffer to each tube. Block tissues for at least 1 h at 4 °C.\nPrepare the samples for structural staining using a fluorescently conjugated antibody, horseradish peroxidase 488 (anti-HRP-488) at a dilution of 1:200 and Phalloidin-647 at a dilution of 1:1000 in blocking buffer to stain motor neurons and muscle tissue, respectively. Make enough stain to have 150 µL per tube. Store the stain at 4 °C covered in foil or in a dark box until ready for staining.\nAfter blocking, remove the excess blocking buffer with a glass Pasteur pipette.\nBefore dispensing the structural stain, vortex the stain. Add 150 µL of the stain to each tube. Place the samples in a dark box on the rotator at room temperature for 2 h.\nRemove the stain and wash the tissues four times in 1.5 mL of room temp 1x PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 5 min on the rotator in a dark box. The samples are now ready to mount to a slide.\n6. Mounting tissue",
    "After washing samples in PBST, prepare a microscope slide to mount tissue for staining. Prepare additional supplies including glass cover slips, a P200 pipette, 200 µL pipette tips, scissors, clear reinforcements, straight edge forceps, anti-fade fluorescent mounting media, nail polish, and a dark box to cover the slides.\nLabel the slide to identify the samples and clean the slide with kimwipes to ensure there are no smudges.\nTo ensure the hemithorax samples are not damaged by the cover slip, build a “bridge” using reinforcement labels. Take one reinforcement label, cut it in half, and place each half approximately 15 mm apart. This distance must be smaller than the width of the cover slip. Repeat this step four times to complete a “bridge” that is 5 labels high.\nTake the P200 pipette and modify a tip by cutting off 1/5th of the tip to transfer the samples to the slide. Samples should be transferred onto the slide in the center of the bridge.\nTake the edge of a lab wipe and remove any excess PBST. Using forceps, arrange the DLMs such that all samples are facing muscle side up and cuticle side down.\nUsing a standard P200 pipette tip, apply 70 µL of mounting media to the slide, avoiding air bubbles. Dispense the media in a circular pattern inside the reinforcements starting from the outside into the center.\nPlace a cover slip over the reinforcements.\nUse nail polish to coat the outside edges around the perimeter of the coverslip. Apply generously to form a complete seal of the tissue.",
    "Place the slide on a flat surface in the dark, allowing at least 10 min to dry and prevent photo-bleaching or loss of fluorescence. Slides may now be used for imaging immediately, or otherwise stored in a slide folder at -20 °C for later viewing.\n7. Alternative: Staining with primary antibodies\nNOTE: This section is optional and should be used directly between sections 4 and 5 if desired.\nTo stain tissue with primary antibodies, submerge tissue in blocking buffer for at least 1 h.\nPrepare primary antibody with proper dilution in blocking buffer. At minimum, prepare enough antibody mixture to have 150 µL per group. Note that the samples are kept still. Store at 4 °C until ready for use.\nRemove excess blocking buffer with a Pasteur pipette. Briefly vortex the primary antibody and add 150 µL of antibody mixture to each group and place samples at 4 °C overnight.\nOn the next day, remove primary antibody and wash tissue 4 times with PBST for 5 min each on a rotator.\nPrepare secondary stain in blocking buffer. Add the secondary stain to the sample and then keep it a room temperature for 2 h in a dark box on the rotator.\n\tNOTE: The secondary staining can also include HRP and phalloidin.\nAfter the 2 h incubation, to remove the secondary stain wash tissue 4 times for 5 min with PBST and proceed to mounting."
