    "1. Fabrication of the organ-on-chip device\nMake a PDMS replica of a mold with the channel designs, fabricated using standard photolithography techniques, and obtain the PDMS parts of the microfluidic chip.\n\t\nWeigh approximately 27 g PDMS base agent and 2.7 g curing agent; the mass ratio needs to be 10:1. This is good for a 3 mm thick PDMS slab on a mold with 130 mm (5 inch) diameter. Mix these components thoroughly.\nDegas the mixture in a desiccator for approximately 45 min to remove air bubbles.\nMeanwhile, prepare the mold for the liquid PDMS mixture by sticking clear tape around the mold or place the mold in a suitable wafer holder.\nPour the degassed PDMS mixture onto the mold. If any air bubbles remained in the PDMS mixture or at the mold surface, degas it again for approximately 30 min.\nCure the PDMS mixture in an oven at 60 °C for 4 h. Allow to cool down.\nIn a cross-flow hood, pull the cured PDMS from the mold; the mold can be reused immediately to make more PDMS replicas.\nCut the PDMS replica into separate top and bottom chip parts using cutting lines in the PDMS.\nPunch four holes in the top parts using a sharp biopsy punch with 1 mm diameter to form inlets and outlets. Punch from inside to outside to prevent PDMS debris from collecting in the chip. Cover the chip parts with clear tape to protect them against dust.\nCut polycarbonate membranes from Transwell inserts into squares of approximately 3×3 mm2.\nAssemble a porous membrane leakage-free in between two PDMS parts in order to assemble a two-layer device interfaced with a porous membrane.\n\tNOTE: This protocol is adapted from Griep et al.19 and Chueh et al.26",
    "Prepare a PDMS/toluene mortar using 0.7 g of PDMS base agent, 0.07 g of curing agent and 540 µL of toluene, resulting in a 5:3 weight ratio. Vortex the mortar thoroughly.\nSpin-coat 200 µL of mortar onto a glass coverslip at 1500 rpm for 60 s (ramped at 1000 rpm/s) to acquire a thin, uniform layer of mortar.\nTransfer a thin layer of mortar from the coverslip onto a bottom part and a top part of the chip with an ink roller. Put the bottom part in an oven-safe dish.\nWith a set of tweezers, dip the edges of a membrane into the spin-coated mortar and place it carefully in the middle of the bottom part.\nCarefully place the top part on the bottom part while paying attention to the alignment.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not exert pressure onto the chip and do not slide the top part over the bottom part to prevent mortar from entering the channels and clogging the membrane.\nCover the chips inlets with clear tape to prevent dust from entering the chip and bake them at 60 °C for 3 h.\nIntegrate electrodes into the side channels.\n\tNOTE: This protocol is adapted from Griep et al.19 and Douville et al.18\nCut platinum wire into pieces of approximately 2 cm. Clean by submerging them in acetone for 30 min. Rinse with water and ethanol and allow to dry.\nIn a cross-flow hood, put a chip on a plastic dish. Insert four platinum wires into the electrode channels of a chip using a pair of tweezers and bend them down onto the plastic dish to enable fixation to the dish in a subsequent step. Insert the wires 0.7-1 mm into the culture channel, past the T-shaped channel junction.",
    "Apply a drop of UV-curable glue at the electrode channel entrance and allow the glue to fill the channel around the electrode by capillary forces.\nSwitch on UV and cure the glue when it reaches the end of the electrode channel.\nCaution: Do not look into the UV light source as this may harm your eyes.\nFixate the four integrated electrodes to the plastic dish with a two-component epoxy adhesive. This allows easier handling of the electrodes during measurements without the risk of pulling the electrodes from the chip.\nCover the chips with clear tape and bake them at 60 °C for 2 h. Allow to cool down and store dust-free until use. In this way they can be safely stored for up to a month.\n2. On-chip culture of brain-derived endothelial cells\nCoat the chips to promote cell attachment.\n\t\nFill both channels with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to wet them before introducing reagents. Check under a microscope if there are any air bubbles in the channels. If so, remove them by flushing with extra PBS.\nFill both channels with 30 µL of 20 µg/mL human fibronectin in PBS. Incubate at 37 °C for 3 hours. Check for air bubbles and, if needed, flush the channels with PBS and refill with fibronectin solution.\nFlush the chips with endothelial growth medium and incubate them at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in an incubator for 2 h.\nMeasure the TEER of the blank chips as described in step 3 to ensure that all of the electrodes are in direct contact with fluid in the channels. In empty chips, typical TEER values are 0-1 Ω cm2.\nSeed cells into the top channel.",
    "Remove the culture medium from a culture flask (75 cm2 culture area) with a confluent monolayer of human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3).\nWash the cells with PBS. Add 2 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2-5 minutes until the cells have detached from the culture flask.\nDeactivate the trypsin with culture medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Count the cells and calculate the total number of cells in suspension.\nMeanwhile, centrifuge the hCMEC/D3 cells at 390 x g for 5 min and remove supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in the appropriate volume of endothelial growth medium (EGM-2) to arrive at a concentration of 5 x 106 cells/mL. This results in a seeding density of 2 x 105 cells/cm2 in the chip.\nSlowly pipette 30 µL of the well-mixed cell suspension into the top channel and remove the pipette from the inlet in a fluent motion while still exerting pressure.\nCheck the seeding density under a microscope. A uniform distribution of cells throughout the top channel should be achieved.\nIncubate the chips at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for at least 1 h. Flush out any non-attached cells with endothelial culture medium.\nMaintain the on-chip endothelial culture.\n\t\nTwice per day, insert culture medium-filled pipette tips as reservoirs in the inlets and replace the medium inside the chip by gravity-driven flow.\n\t\tNOTE: To avoid air bubbles from entering the microchannels and destroying the cell layer, make sure to make fluid-fluid contact between the pipette tip and the fluid on top of the chip before inserting the tip into an inlet. This can be facilitated by adding a small drop at the in/outlet prior to pipette insertion.\nAlso add pipette tip reservoirs in the outlets to prevent the channels from drying.",
    "Incubate the chips at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n3. On-chip TEER measurements\nSet up the TEER measurement apparatus, consisting of a lock-in amplifier and a probe cable circuit as was specified in Van der Helm et al.16 Alternatively, potentiostats or impedance analyzers are also suitable for these impedance-based TEER measurements.\nTake the chip from the incubator and allow it to reach room temperature for at least 10 min. Remove any fluid from the plastic dish around the electrodes to prevent electrode bridging outside of the chip.\nTake the impedance spectrum from 200 Hz to 1 MHz for each combination of two electrodes, resulting in 6 impedance spectra per chip in only 5-10 min. Check if the impedance spectra have the expected magnitudes and shapes to validate the TEER measurement, as is described in the results section.\nPut the chip back in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 after finishing the measurement.\nProcess the obtained impedance spectra to arrive at a normalized TEER value.\n\t\nGet the measured resistance imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56334/56334eq1.jpg between electrodes imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56334/56334eq2.jpg and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56334/56334eq3.jpg, as denoted in Figure 2B and D, from the resistive plateau at 10 kHz in the corresponding impedance spectra.\nCalculate the TEER using the six measured resistances corresponding to one chip at one time point by using the equation of Figure 2G16:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56334/56334eq20.jpg\n\t\tIn this equation, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56334/56334eq4.jpg is the culture area through which the resistance was measured, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56334/56334eq5.jpg is the resistance of the cellular barrier and the membrane, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56334/56334eq6.jpg, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56334/56334eq7.jpg, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56334/56334eq8.jpg and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56334/56334eq9.jpg are the resistance values measured through the cellular barrier and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56334/56334eq10.jpg and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56334/56334eq11.jpg are the resistance values measured in the straight channels.16 The equation is derived from the equivalent circuit illustrated in Figure 2C.",
