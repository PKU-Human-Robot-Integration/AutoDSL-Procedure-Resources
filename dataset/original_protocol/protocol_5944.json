    "Detection of RRSV-diseased rice plants through RT-PCR and Western blotsThe source of RRSV-diseased rice plants, exhibiting typical symptoms including stuntedness, excess tillering, and leaves that are dark green and/or have serrated edges or twisted tips (Zhang et al., 2016), are collected from the field (Fuzhou City, Fujian Province). The presence of RRSV is confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot.RT-PCRExtract total RNA from 0.1 g leaves with disease symptoms using a Plant RNA kit (OMEGA Bio-Tek Inc.) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcribe 1 μg total RNA by using the ReverTra Ace qPCR RT Kit (TOYOBO), following the manufacturer’s manuals. Then amplify the RRSV CP gene with the primers: 5’-GAGCAAACTTGAGGCGTA-3’, and 5’-AAGCTACCGTGTAGGTGGCG-3’.Run PCR on the Bio-Rad  CFX ConnectTM  PCR System under the cycling conditions of 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 20 sec, 55 °C for 30 sec and 72 °C for 5 sec.Using rice β-Actin gene amplified with the primers: 5’-CAGCCACACTGTCCCCATCTA-3’, and 5’-AGCAAGGTCGAGACGAAGGA-3’ as a control. Perform Agarose gel electrophoresis and then visualize the amplification products of RRSV CP gene using Gel Imaging System was used to.Western blotsTotal protein is extracted from 0.1 g RRSV-infected leaves, which were grounded into powder with liquid nitrogen in ceramic mortar and then transferred into a 1.5 ml pre-cooled clear Microtubes, followed by adding 100 μl plant protein extraction buffer. Make the sample mix evenly by using a vortex. Then centrifuge at 6,010 x g 4 °C for 10 min. For RRSV detection, 20 µl of the prepared total protein is used to conduct polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot. The detailed steps are as follows:Load 20 µl of the prepared total protein in each well of the PAGE gel, along with prestained marker, and run the gel for 90 min at 120 V.",
    "Prepare a PVDF membrane which is slightly bigger than the size of the gel. Prepare 2 pieces of filter paper which is as big as PVDF membrane. Place the PVDF membrane, gel and filter papers in 1x transferring buffer for 10 min. Prepare the transfer sandwich (filter paper-PVDF membrane-gel-filter paper) and place it in a Semi-dry transfer slot with 3.0-5.5 mA/cm2 for 30 min.Block the membrane in 5% skimmed milk in PBS-T (see Recipes) at room temperature (RT) for 0.5-1 h.Wash the membrane with PBS-T three times for 5 min each time.Incubate the membrane in the monoclonal anti-CP antibody solution (see Recipes) by using a decolorizing orbital shaker at RT for 2 h or at 4 °C overnight.Wash the membrane with PBS-T three times for 10 min each time.Incubate in the HRP-conjugated antibody solution by using Decolorizing Orbital Shaker at RT for 1 h. Wash the membrane with PBS-T five times for 5 min each time.Use the Chemiluminescent HRP substrate to blot according to the manufacturer’s instruction.Put a single piece of x-ray film into a film cassette in a black box.Use the developing machine to automatically develop, fix, wash, and dry exposed film.Vector virus-acquisitionWash RRSV-infected rice plants confirmed as described in Procedure A with water and plant them in a square plastic box, then put the box into a clip-cage (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181016/20181016225446_1680.jpgFigure 2.

    "To prepare viruliferous BPH population with high virus-carrying rate and overcome the limited lifespan of BPH, we allow 20 female BPH adults finished in mating to be fed on RRSV-diseased rice plants, and 3-5 days later, they lay eggs on RRSV-infected rice plants. About 7 days later, nymphs began to hatch, feed on infected rice and acquire virus as early as they can.About 12 days later, after nymphs hatching, all the nymphs go through a 9-day latent period (Jia et al., 2012), and then they can be used for virus transmission.Simultaneously, we put 20 female BPH adults finished in mating to be fed on healthy rice plants to generate non-viruliferous BPH population as control vector.Preparation of rice seedlings for virus transmissionAdd 150-200 ml of fine soil to clean square plastic boxes and moisten the soil with 100 ml water added along the box wall.Scatter about 100 pre-germinated seeds on the soil and then sprinkle with a thin layer of soil. Put the square plastic boxes into a clip-cage (Figures 3A and 3B) and place on the tissue culture frame in a growth room at 25 °C with a photoperiod of 16 h/8 h (light/dark) with intensity 5,000-7,000 Lux until the rice seedlings have grown to 2 leaf stage, when they can be used for virus transmission.Virus transmissionAllow the nymphs to feed at test seedlings for 3 days on the tissue culture frame in the growth room.Suck up viruliferous and non-viruliferous BPH nymphs by using an artificial suction-implement to test rice seedlings at three-leaf stage. The ratio of the number of nymphs and the number of seedlings is 2:1, owing to the virus carrying rate of BPH nymphs is approximately 70% (Zhang et al., 2013).",
    "Transplanting of RRSV-inoculated rice seedlingsOnce rice seedlings inoculated with viruliferous and non-viruliferous BPH nymphs, remove the vector thoroughly from the test seedlings and then grow the rice seedlings in the greenhouse for symptom observation. As shown in Figure 3C, usually sixteen rice seedlings are transplanted into one basin evenly (Figure 3C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181016/20181016225500_4994.jpgFigure 3.
