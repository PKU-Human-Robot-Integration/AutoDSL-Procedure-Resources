    "**Cultivation and harvest of cells followed by high molecular weight \\(HMW) genomic DNA extraction**\nThis step isolates all high molecular weight DNA from human cancer cell lines using magnetic bead-based purification. Purification of all high molecular weight DNA allows for isolation of a broad range of circular DNA species sizes. The method is adapted from the Qiagen MagAttract High Molecular Weight DNA Kit<sup>6</sup>. \n1. Cultivate between 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> and 1.0 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells. \n  \n2. Trypsinize cells and centrifuge a maximum of 1.0 x 10<sup>7</sup> cells at 300 x g for 5 minutes at 25°C. Remove and discard the supernatant, taking care not to disturb the cell pellet. The pellet may be stored at -80°C for future use or may be used immediately. It is recommended to use freshly pelleted cells to avoid cell death by freeze-thaw. \n  \n3. Using the Qiagen HMW DNA Kit, gently resuspend the pellet in 180 µL in 50 mM TrisHCl, 10 mM EDTA and transfer the sample to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. \n  \n4. Add 20 µL proteinase K and mix by tapping the tube.  \n  \n5. Place the sample in a thermomixer or shaker-incubator. Incubate at 56°C while shaking at 900 rpm for 2 hours. The time required for complete cell lysis depends on the cell-type and cell number. \n  \n6. Add 4 µL RNase A \\(100 mg/mL) and incubate for 2 minutes at 25°C. \n  \n7. Add 150 µL Buffer AL and mix well by pipetting up and down. \n  \n8. Add 280 µL Buffer MB and vortex for 2 minutes. \n  \n9. Add 40 µL of MagAttract Suspension G to the sample and shake at 1400 rpm for 2 minutes. \n  \nNote: Vortex Suspension G before adding to the sample to ensure that the magnetic particles are fully resuspended.",
    "10. Place the sample tube in a magnetic rack and wait approximately 1 minute for bead separation to be complete. Carefully remove all of the supernatant in the tube and avoid disturbing the magnetic bead pellet. \n  \n11. Add 700 µL of Buffer MW1 and shake at 1400 rpm for 2 minutes. \n  \n12.

Add 700 µL of Buffer PM and shake at 1400 rpm for 2 minutes. \n  \n16. Place the sample tube in a magnetic rack and wait approximately 1 minute for bead separation to be complete. Carefully remove all of the supernatant in the tube and avoid disturbing the magnetic bead pellet. \n  \n17. Carefully add 700 µL of distilled, nuclease-free water to the sample tube while the tube is on the magnetic rack. Do not add water directly to the bead pellet; carefully pipet the water down the side of the tube facing away from the pellet.  Incubate the tube on the magnetic rack for 1 minute at 25°C and the remove supernatant. \n  \n18. Remove the sample tube from the magnetic rack. Add 200 µL distilled, nuclease-free water and shake at 1400 rpm for 3 minutes. \n  \n19. Place the sample tube back on the magnetic rack and wait 1 minute for bead separation. Transfer the supernatant to a new sample tube. This supernatant contains the high molecular weight gDNA. \n  \n20. Measure the concentration of the DNA.",
    "**Optional control - Linearization of circular DNA**\nThis step is optional and should be done with a fraction of the HMW DNA extracted above as it will result in the linearization and thus loss of circular DNA. This step uses the endonuclease MssI/PmeI to hydrolyze mitochondrial and other large circular DNA to create exposed DNA ends and serves as a control to ensure circularity of the DNA. These DNA ends can then be accessed by an exonuclease to hydrolyze any linear DNA in the sample. In case your circular DNA of interest has no MssI site, use a different endonuclease with restrictions sites at your circular DNA. \n1. Treat purified high molecular weight DNA with the rare-cutting endonuclease MssI/PmeI. To digest 5 µg DNA, prepare the following 50 µL reaction: \n  \n0.2 µL MssI \\(5 U/µL)\n5 µL 10x Buffer B \nUp to 44.8 µL HMW DNA \\(5 µg)\nFill to 50 µL with distilled, nuclease-free water \\(quantity required for 50 µL total volume) \nIncubate the reaction at 37°C for 16 hours and then heat inactivate the endonuclease at 80°C for 5 minutes. \nElimination of linear chromosomal DNA and purification of circular DNA\n1. Treat the reaction with Plasmid-Safe exonuclease to facilitate digestion of linear DNA. Add the following to the reaction for a total volume of 100 µL: \n  \n2 µL Plasmid-Safe ATP-Dependent DNase \\(20 units) \n4 µL ATP \\(25 mM)\n10 µL Plasmid-Safe 10x Reaction Buffer \n34 µL distilled, nuclease-free water \nIncubate the reaction at 37°C for 24 hours. \n2. Perform hydrolysis of linear DNA at 37°C for 5 days. After each 24 hour incubation, add the following to each reaction to continue the enzymatic digestion: \n  \n2 µL Plasmid-Safe ATP-Dependent DNase \\(20 units) \n4 µL ATP \\(25 mM)\n0.6 µL Plasmid-Safe 10x Reaction Buffer",
    "3. After 5 days of digestion, heat inactivate the exonuclease by incubating at 70°C for 30 minutes. \n  \n4. Sample 2 µL of the exonuclease-digested reaction to confirm elimination of linear chromosomal DNA by quantitative polymerase chain reaction \\(qPCR). Use primers to amplify a chromosomal marker such as the β-globin gene HBB. \n  \n**Quantitative PCR of HBB gene to confirm elimination of linear chromosomal DNA**\nThis step uses qPCR of the human beta globin gene, HBB, to assess the fold-reduction of linear chromosomal DNA after exonuclease digestion and MDA. \nPrepare each reaction as follows:\n10 µL SYBR Green Master Mix \\(2x) \n1 µL Beta globin forward primer \\(10 µM)\n1 µL Beta globin reverse primer \\(10 µM)\n1.5 µL Sample DNA\n6.5 µL distilled, nuclease free water\nRun reactions using a standard protocol on a real-time PCR machine, for example StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system. \n**Rolling circle amplification of circular DNA by Multiple Displacement Amplification \\(MDA)**\nThis step amplifies the remaining circular DNA in the reaction by MDA using φ29 DNA polymerase and random hexamer primers. Using the Qiagen REPLI-g Mini Kit7, from which this reaction is adapted, prepare the MDA reaction as follows: \n1. Place 5 µL of the exonuclease-digested sample into a 0.2 mL PCR tube. \n  \n2. Add 5 µL Buffer D1 to the sample. Vortex to mix and centrifuge briefly. Incubate the sample at 25°C for 3 minutes. \n  \n3. Add 10 µL Buffer N1 to the sample. Vortex to mix and centrifuge briefly.  \n  \n4. Prepare the REPLI-g DNA Polymerase master mix as follows: \n  \n29 µL REPLI-g Mini Reaction Buffer\n1 µL REPLI-g Mini DNA Polymerase \n5. Add the 30 µL master mix to the 20 µL sample for a total reaction volume of 50 µL. Incubate the reaction at 30°C for 16 hours.",
    "6. Heat inactivate the reaction at 65°C for 3 minutes. \n  \n7. Measure the quantity of double-stranded DNA obtained from the MDA reaction fluorometrically, for example using a Qubit Fluorometer. \n  \nNote: It is not recommended to measure DNA quantity at this step with a spectrophotometer due to the presence of random hexamer primers and φ29 DNA polymerase in the reaction mixture.  \n**Sample Cleanup**\nThis step uses magnetic bead-based purification for removal of random hexamer primers and φ29 DNA polymerase from the reaction mixture. This protocol is adapted from the NEBNext DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina8.\n1. First, vortex AMPure XP beads vigorously to ensure they are fully resuspended. \n  \n2.

Briefly centrifuge the tube and place in on the magnetic rack. Wait for 5 minutes to allow beads to fully separate from the supernatant. When the solution is clear, transfer the supernatant containing the DNA to a new tube.\n  \n**Shearing of Amplified circular DNA**\n \nThis step shears the amplified circular DNA into fragments of appropriate size for the generation of DNA libraries that may be used for Next Generation Sequencing. \nShear a minimum of 50 ng and up to 2 µg of the amplified circular DNA with a focused ultrasonicator \\(e.g. the Covaris S220 series) for an average target peak size of 150 - 200 bp. Use the following settings for a 50 µL sample in a Covaris 6x16 mm microtube: \nPeak power: 175.0 W  \nDuty factor: 10.0 \nCycles/burst: 200 \nTemperature: 6°C\nTime: 6 minutes \nTransfer sonicated circular DNA to a new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. \n*Library Preparation for Next Generation Sequencing \nEnd-Repair, Adaptor Ligation, and USER Enzyme Digestion Reactions* \nThis step prepares DNA libraries for Next Generation Sequencing. First, DNA ends are repaired by the addition of a 3’ adenine nucleotide \\(3’ dA-tailing) and 5’ thymine nucleotide \\(5’ phosphorylation).
