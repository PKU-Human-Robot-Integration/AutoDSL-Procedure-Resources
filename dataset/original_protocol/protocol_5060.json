    "Extraction of the root barkDry the root bark in the shade for one week at 30-35 °C. Note: If this is not your regular ambient temperature you may use a drying oven.Shred the bark finely with a sharp axe and extract it with MeOH (1:1, w/v) in a capped fermentation tank for one week. Stir the mixture several times a day. If possible: stir your extraction mixture permanently with a mechanical stirrer.Note: In our case, the extraction was performed under regular laboratory condition at ambient temperature (30-35 °C in Pakistan).Filter off the solid through a tightly woven cloth and evaporate the MeOH on the rotary evaporator at 30 °C and 70 mbar for several hours, upon which the extract becomes highly viscous. Since it is not possible to completely remove the MeOH, stop with the evaporation of the solvent when no longer the formation of bubbles in the extract can be observed.Store the almost black, viscous extract at 4 °C until it is used.Note: In our experiment, we extracted 45 kg of root bark with 45 L of MeOH and obtained 215 g of the black, viscous extract.Chromatographic separation of the alkaloids: general proceduresThe chromatographic separation of the codonocarpine type alkaloids on silica gel (SiO2) involves at least four chromatographic separations that follow all the main principles described below:Adsorption of the sample on SiO2The crude extract and the alkaloid fractions are poorly soluble in small amounts of MeOH and even less soluble in the eluent that is used for the chromatography. It is, however, very important to apply the extract onto the chromatography column within the smallest possible volume. Therefore, the mixtures were adsorbed on SiO2 before they were brought onto the column.Transfer the sample into a round bottom flask and add MeOH (1:4, w/v).",
    "Take a large round bottom flask (we used a 250 ml flask for 10.8 g of extract) to ensure that the glass surface is large enough to secure later a rapid and efficient evaporation of the solvent. Add a magnetic stir bar and stir vigorously until you obtain a uniform (still heterogeneous) mixture. While still stirring, add SiO2 (sample/SiO2 1:2, w/w), and continue with stirring for another 5 min.Remove the stir bar and then remove the MeOH on the rotary evaporator (30 °C, 160 mbar) until you obtain a bright brown powder.Preparation of the eluent mixture and the columnMix the eluent components in the given ratio (Tables 1-5) in a clean glass bottle. It is crucial to distil the solvents prior to use. Prepare a column as shown in Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170216/20170216183620_9941.jpg Figure 2. Packing of a chromatographic column. The columns were stacked layers of cotton wool (A), sea sand (B), SiO2 (C), additional sea sand (D) and the adsorbed sample on SiO2 (E).Fill the column with approximately 5 cm of the eluent and seal it loosely and free of air at the bottom with some cotton wool (Figure 2A) to prevent the SiO2 from flowing out.Add 1 cm of sea sand (Figure 2B) so that you obtain a plane surface.In a beaker, prepare a slightly viscous, bubble-free suspension of SiO2 in the eluent. Add eluent until the SiO2 is well covered and stir with a spatula until all air has escaped.Fill the SiO2 suspension through a glass funnel carefully, not disturbing the surface of the sea sand, into your glass column to obtain a loose column of SiO2 (Figure 2C).Open the stopcock and let the eluent escape until the solvent surface exactly reaches the surface of the SiO2. Close the stopcock.",
    "Compact the SiO2 column by tapping against the glass column with a piece of vacuum hose. Upon tapping you can observe that the SiO2 level drops. Open the stopcock from time to time to drain the solvent again to the SiO2 surface. Continue compacting until the SiO2 surface no longer sinks.Add approximately 5 cm of solvent and trickle approximately 2 cm of sea sand (Figure 2D) through the solvent onto the surface of your column to protect the column against mechanical perturbations. Drain the solvent until its surface reaches the surface of the sea sand.Apply the brown powder of your adsorbed substance onto the column (Figure 2E), add carefully 2 cm of eluent, then drain the eluent carefully until it reaches the surface of your SiO2 with the adsorbed extract. Repeat the addition and draining of solvent three times.Carefully fill up the column with the eluent, connect the solvent reservoir, fix it with a clamp, and fill the reservoir with eluent.Chromatographic separationTo start your separation, open the stopcock and adjust the flow of the eluent to an appropriate rate. Depending on the size of the column, this shall be approx. 12 ml min-1 (coarse fractionation) or approx. 4 ml min-1 (fine fractionation). If the flow rate is too low with a completely opened stopcock, apply slight but constant pressure with a manual pump.Collect fractions of reasonable volumes. The volumes to choose depend on the size of the column and the intended purpose of the chromatography. For a preliminary, rough separation of the original crude extract on a large column, 100 ml fractions, collected in Erlenmeyer flasks, are appropriate. For fine separations on smaller columns, preferential fractions of approx. 10 ml are collected in round bottom test tubes.",
    "Since the alkaloids of interest are readily recognizable as yellow bands on the column, the clearly colourless pre-fractions are usually collected in Erlenmeyer flasks. Fraction control by TLCTransfer a small amount of your fraction with a glass capillary on a TLC plate and let the spot dry. You can re-use the same capillary several times when you clean it in-between with some MeOH.Place the TLC plate in a TLC chamber (Figure 3) with 3-5 mm of one of the following eluents:CH2Cl2/MeOH/NH3 40:13:1: to test if your fraction contains any spermidine alkaloids at all. The typical Rf value for the spermidine alkaloids is shown in Figure 3.MeOH/H2O/NH3 15:2:1: to test which spermidine alkaloid is in your fraction. This eluent was developed by Kyburz (1985) and was the only one that was found to distinguish between the alkaloids of the different masses. The typical Rf values for the spermidine alkaloids are given in Figure 3.Let the TLC develop till the solvent front reaches almost the top of the plate, remove the TLC plate from the chamber, and let it dry until the plate no longer smells of NH3.Check for UV-active spots under a UV lamp (254 nm) and mark them with a pencil.Stain your TLC plate with Schlittler reagent and dry it. The spermidine alkaloids give red/violet spots. When the dry Schlittler-active spots are stained subsequently with Ce(SO4)2 solution, the colour of the spots deepens. According to our experience, the detection by UV is the most sensitive method. Combined with the staining with Schlittler reagent, the spots for the alkaloids of interest are very specifically and clearly recognized. The treatment with Ce(SO4)2 is helpful but not necessary.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170216/20170216184427_1690.jpgFigure 3. TLC chamber and the schematic TLCs with the two most useful eluents for the detection of spermidine alkaloids.",
    "For the detection of the alkaloid fractions in the preliminary rough chromatography use the eluent system CH2Cl2/MeOH/NH3 40:13:1 (gives no separation of the individual alkaloids, left), and for fine separation of the alkaloids use the eluent system MeOH/H2O/NH3 15:2:1 (separation of the individual alkaloids, right). However, codonocarpine (2) and isocodonocarpine (3) remain indistinguishable by TLC.Combination of the fractions and evaporation of the solventCombine the fractions according to their TLCs. Pay attention not to pool pure alkaloid fractions with fractions that contain alkaloid mixtures. Mind that the alkaloids are chromatographing quite closely, and a lowly abundant alkaloid next to a major component may not be easily recognized by TLC! Very small amounts of an alkaloid are only detected by UV light but not with the Schlittler staining reagent.Evaporate the solvent on the rotary evaporator at 30 °C (pressure depending on your eluent), and remove residual solvent at high vacuum (23 °C, 4 x 10-4 mbar).Note: To determine the net mass of your sample subtract the tare mass (empty flask) from the gross mass (sample + flask).Control your dried samples by HPLC-MS (see Data analysis). Check their final alkaloid composition with the extracted ion chromatograms (EIC) m/z 436.2231 (1), m/z 466.2237 (2/3) and m/z 496.2442 (4).Chromatographic separation of the four major alkaloids in detailNotes: This section contains a detailed description of what was done in our laboratory. For an improved separation, we recommend the following steps:1. Start with a rough alkaloid isolation as done in column B (Table 3).2. Separate the alkaloids 1 and 2/3 from alkaloid 4 as described for column B1 (Table 4).3. Combine all fractions containing 1 and 2/3 to one sample and chromatograph this as described in column A1.2 to obtain pure 1 and 2/3 (Table 2).4. Wash the fraction containing 4 with MeOH as described for B1.",
    "4.1.The four alkaloids cadabicine (1, 435 Da), codonocarpine (2, 465 Da), isocodonocarpine (3, 465 Da) and capparidisinine (4, 495 Da) have very similar chromatographic behaviours. For this reason, we obtained at the beginning of our project many mixed fractions upon preliminary chromatographies of the crude original extract as well as of partially separated fractions. For the isolation of 1 and 2/3 we started with an alkaloid mixture (A1, 576 mg) that was obtained by the combination of several of these fractions. A pre-purified alkaloid fraction that could be used likewise is fraction B1, employed below for the isolation of capparidisine (4).Path A: Isolation of cadabicine (1) and codonocarpine (2)/isocodonocarpine (3)The separation path A is schematically shown in Figure 4. The alkaloid-containing fractions of various preliminary chromatographies (A) were combined in A1. The chromatographic separation of A1 led to four major fractions. Three of them contained mixtures of 1 and 2/3 in diverse ratios (A1.1 mainly 1, A1.2 comparable amounts of 1 and 2/3, and A1.3 mainly 2/3). The fourth fraction (A1.4) contained mainly alkaloid 4 but also some 2/3. As none of the obtained fractions contained a pure alkaloid, the samples A1.1 and A1.3 were kept as reserve material and the largest fraction (A1.2) was further separated on SiO2 to obtain the alkaloids 1 (A1.2.1) and 2/3 (A1.2.3) in high purity (> 98%).Unfortunately, fraction A1.4 contained not enough material for the final isolation of pure 4.The chromatic details and results are summarized in the Tables 1 and 2. In fractions of alkaloid mixtures, the major alkaloid is underlined. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170216/20170216190353_5674.jpg Figure 4. Separation path A.

The crude methanolic extract (B) was roughly fractionated on SiO2 to separate the alkaloid-containing fractions (B1) from the further extracted material. The alkaloid mixture B1 was chromatographed to obtain three fractions containing different ratios of 1 and 2/3 (B1.1-B1.3) and one fraction containing only one alkaloid (4). Alkaloid 4 in fraction B1.4 however, was contaminated with some unidentified Schlittler-inactive compounds (detected by 1H-NMR). An additional chromatographic step (B1.4.1) could not separate the alkaloid 4 from its contaminates. Capparidisinine (4, B1.4.1.1) was finally gained by washing sample B1.4.1 with small amounts of MeOH.The chromatic details and results are summarized in the Tables 3-5. In fractions of alkaloid mixtures, the major alkaloid is underlined. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170216/20170216190509_9452.jpg Figure 5. Separation path B.

The cloudy mixture was shaken carefully and then centrifuged (1 min, 20,817 x g). The yellow solution was carefully separated from the remaining solid with a pipette. The solid was washed three more times with MeOH (0.2 ml each time). The remaining solid was transferred to a round bottom flask, and dried in vacuo (30 °C, 160 mbar then 23 °C, 0.",
