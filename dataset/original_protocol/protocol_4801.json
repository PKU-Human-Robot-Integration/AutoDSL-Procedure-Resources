    "General safety notes for entire experiment: When working with BSL-2 organisms such as S. aureus, all potential aerosol-generating steps should be performed in a Class II A2 biosafety cabinet to ensure user safety. An asterisk (*) has been placed beside each step below which should be performed in a biosafety cabinet to preserve aseptic technique and user safety. Please note that although the demonstrations presented in videos 1-4 were filmed at a lab bench (to facilitate clear videography), these steps should be performed under a Class II A2 Biosafety Cabinet when working with BSL-2 bacteria. Likewise, MSDS sheets for DEA/NO, DEA, and DMSO (available online from the manufacturers) should be read carefully before starting this experiment, and recommended safety precautions be taken to avoid skin exposure and respiratory inhalation as necessary for each chemical. Therefore, perform chemical manipulations as appropriate under a chemical fume hood. Additionally, wear a lab coat, goggles, and nitrile gloves for all steps of the protocol, to comply with both biosafety and chemical safety considerations.Day 1:*Streak a TSA plate for isolation from frozen glycerol stock of a S. aureus strain of interest. Incubate in plate incubator at 37 °C for 24 h. In this example protocol the clinical methicillin-susceptible strain UAMS-1 (Gillaspy et al., 1995) was used.Day 2:*Use a single S. aureus colony (from TSA plate in step 1) to inoculate 3 ml of biofilm media in a sterile plastic culture tube. Grow in shaking incubator at 37 °C, 250 rpm for 16 h. *Add 350 µl 20% (v/v) human plasma solution to 4 wells of a Costar 24-well tissue culture plate. Seal the lid to the plate with wrapping film, and store at 4 °C until use on Day 3.Day 3：Remove 24-well plate from 4 °C and equilibrate to room temperature.",
    "Determine the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of a 20-fold dilution in sterile TSB of the S. aureus overnight culture using a spectrophotometer. Use sterile TSB as a blank control for the spectrophotometer. Multiply this reading by 20 to calculate the actual OD600/ml of the overnight culture.Calculate how much overnight culture to use to inoculate 1 ml biofilm media to a final OD600/ml = 0.05. Scale-up the volumes as necessary depending on the number of biofilm wells you plan to inoculate, and add 1 ml to account for pipetting error (In this particular sample protocol, 3 biofilm wells will be inoculated, therefore 4 ml of biofilm media containing diluted overnight culture is needed.).Using the P1000 pipette, carefully withdraw all plasma solution from each well of the 24-well plate. Tip the plate at a 15-30° angle and pipette from the corner of each well to ensure complete removal of the plasma solution. *Mix the diluted overnight culture (in this example 4 ml of diluted overnight culture in biofilm medium) by vortexing for 5 sec at top speed, and immediately transfer 1 ml to 3 plasma-coated wells from step 7.*Transfer 1 ml of sterile biofilm media to the forth (empty) plasma-coated well. This will serve as a negative control for aseptic technique.Place 24-well tissue culture plate in 37 °C plate incubator and grow for 7 h.Following growth, visually inspect the negative control well for contamination. The negative control well should look identical to the appearance of sterile media (i.e., no turbid growth or particulate matter should be present). If contamination occurs in the negative control well, do not proceed with the rest of the experiment.*Harvest the total biomass (biofilm + supernatant) from each well by vigorously pipetting, mixing, and scraping the bottom of the well with the P1000 pipette.",
    "This step usually takes 30 sec-1 min for each well, depending on the biofilm thickness. Performing work in a sterile environment is not necessary for sample integrity at this and subsequent steps. However, they should be performed under a Biosafety cabinet when working with BSL-2 organisms. Appropriate care should also be used to minimize cross-contamination of samples. Please refer to Video 1 for an example of this step. Transfer contents of each well to a sterile 1.7 ml micro-centrifuge tube.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Demonstration of biofilm harvesting from 24-well tissue culture plate Collect cells by centrifugation at 17,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.While samples are centrifuging in step 13, dim the lights, remove a 5 µl aliquot of 5 mM DAF-FM diacetate stock solution from the -20 °C freezer, and thaw by vortexing. Note: DAF-FM is very light sensitive so be sure to perform all subsequent steps with the lights lowered. Dim ambient light (i.e., natural light from windows) is acceptable as long as the DAF-FM is not directly exposed to the light source. Once thawed, prepare the DAF-FM diacetate working solution. The working solution of DAF-FM diacetate should be wrapped in foil until used in step 17 below. This protocol works best if the 5 µM DAF-FM diacetate solution is prepared just prior to use in step 17 below.*Completely remove the culture supernatant from each centrifuged tube (step 13) with the P1000 pipette (Video 2). <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Demonstration of supernatant removal from centrifuged cell pellet *Resuspend each cell pellet in 1 ml of 5 µM DAF-FM diacetate (prepared in step 15). S.",
    "aureus cell pellets will not resuspend well by vortexing alone, so use the P1000 pipette to break apart the cell pellet by scraping and pipetting (Video 3), then vortex the tube at top speed for 10 sec.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Demonstration of cell pellet resuspension in DAF-FM diacetate solution Incubate all tubes for 60 min at 37 °C in the plate incubator. Tubes may be covered in foil to reduce exposure to ambient light if this is a concern.While cell suspensions are incubating in step 18, freshly prepare the following solutions: 100 µM DEA in 1x HBSS, 100 µM DEA/NO in 1x HBSS. Collect cell pellets by centrifugation for 5 min, 17,000 x g at room temperature.*Discard supernatants as described in step 16 and Video 2.*To wash residual extracellular stain from cell pellets, resuspend each pellet in 1 ml 1x HBSS buffer as described in step 17 and Video 3. Collect cell pellets by centrifugation for 5 min, 17,000 x g at room temperature.*Discard supernatants as described in step 16 and Video 2.*Resuspend each cell pellet (as described in step 17 and Video 3) as follows:1 pellet in 0.65 ml 1x HBSS buffer alone (“Untreated” cells stained with DAF-FM diacetate; baseline level of intracellular NO/RNS)1 pellet in 0.65 ml 1x HBSS containing 100 µM DEA (“DEA” treated cells stained with DAF-FM diacetate; a control for the DEA portion of the chemical NO donor used in step 25c below)1 pellet in 0.65 ml 1x HBSS containing 100 µM DEA/NO (“DEA/NO”-treated cells stained with DAF-FM diacetate; a positive control which should yield high-level intracellular fluorescence relative to the untreated and DEA treated samples)Note: It is important at this step that the sample cell densities are very similar to each other. In our experience, small variations in OD600 (i.e.",
    ", sample OD600 values that are within 10% of each other) can be accounted for by reporting the data as RFU/OD (as described in step 28 below). However, larger variations in OD600 between samples will lead to inconsistent/difficult to interpret results. It is therefore recommended that the OD600 be checked at this step, and sample volumes adjusted accordingly, when working with different growth conditions or with biological samples that are suspected to grow at different rates during the initial culture incubation (step 10). For S. aureus samples, we typically aim for an OD600 ~1.0 per well. However, we have also observed reproducible results with well OD600 values as high as 2.0, again as long as the OD600 values of all samples across a given experiment are very similar to each other. *Immediately transfer 200 µl aliquots of each cell suspension in triplicate to wells of a Costar 3904 96-well plate (Video 4 and Figure 1). Additionally, transfer 200 µl aliquots of 1x HBSS in triplicate to this 96-well plate (This “buffer only” samples serves as a negative control for any background fluorescence attributable to the buffer itself. 1x HBSS tends to have low auto-fluorescence relative to cell samples.). Plate may be covered in foil to reduce exposure to ambient light at this step if this is a concern.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 4.

Schematic of DAF-FM stained cell samples loaded in triplicate in a 96-well plate (Step 26).",
    "In this example experiment, higher-level DAF-FM fluorescence is expected in the positive control cell sample treated with DEA/NO (chemical NO donor; dark green wells), whereas detection of endogenous intracellular NO/RNS by DAF-FM fluorescence in the DEA treated and untreated samples (light green wells) are expected to be similar to each other, and both lower than the NO-treated positive control sample. Buffer alone (no DAF-FM stain present; white wells) should have very low levels of auto-fluorescence relative to the DAF-FM stained cells samples.Incubate this 96-well plate in the Biotek Synergy HT fluorescent plate reader. Time-course protocol settings should include the following: 37 °C, 3 sec medium shake prior to each reading, Fluorescence (EX/EM 485 ± 10/516 ± 10) and OD600 measurements recorded every 15 min for up to 60 min total. For S. aureus samples, the peak fluorescence of each sample usually occurs by 30 min.Report data as relative fluorescent units (RFU) per OD600 of each well. Please see (Lewis et al., 2015; Sapp et al., 2014) and Figure 2 for representative data.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160713/20160713233801_4135.jpgFigure 2. Detection of intracellular NO/RNS in S. aureus with DAF-FM diacetate. Cells harvested from replicate UAMS-17 h static biofilms were resuspended in 1x HBSS containing 5 µM DAF-FM diacetate. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, cells were collected by centrifugation, washed, and resuspended in 1x HBSS alone (“untreated”) or 1x HBSS supplemented with 100 µM DEA or 100 µM DEA/NO. Aliquots (200 µl) of each cell suspension were immediately transferred to a 96-well plate, and incubated at 37 °C in a Synergy HT fluorescent plate reader. Fluorescence and OD600 measurements were recorded after 30 min, and data were reported as relative fluorescent units (RFU) per OD600 of each well. Data represents the average of n = 3 independent experiments, error bars = SEM.",
