    "NOTE: Software required are ImageJ (or similar image-modifying software) and Matlab R2015. The user may encounter compatibility issues with other versions of Matlab.\n1. Pre-Processing Images\nFor any grayscale image, ensure the maximum intensity value of any given pixel is <255. This is typically done by subtracting a value of 1 from the image in the custom Matlab program \"ImageSub.m\", included in supplemental file S1.\n2. Outlining the Perinexus\nOutline the perinexus in ImageJ or other image-processing software.\nEnsure that the outline is one pixel thick and is set to the highest intensity value in an image (255 in a grayscale image from 0 to 255).\nIdentify the GJ by its pentalaminar structure11,12, and define the beginning of the perinexus as the point at which the two opposing cell membrane bilayers diverge, as shown in Figure 1A. Begin ~200 nm from the edge of the GJ, tracing along the inner membrane of the first cell and back along the inner membrane of the second cell. In ImageJ, release the pen to automatically close the outline. This artificial closing will be cropped out later.\n\tNOTE: It is crucial to outline the perinexus with great care at as high a magnification as possible, as even small mis-applications of the outline can result in several nanometers of error in the final measurement.\n3. Setting up Algorithm and Selecting Perinexus of Interest\nNOTE: The pathfinding algorithm requires the AutoGraph, Edge, Graph, Node , and Pathfinding functions9 to be in the same directory as the MembraneSepDist m-file. All files can be found in supplemental file S1.\nSelect save locations for data and figures. These are currently hard-coded into the m-file.",
    "NOTE: The first line of the program is a function to clear all variables, close all windows and clear the command window. Save any desired variables or figures before running the m-file.\n\tNOTE: Software screenshots are included in supplemental file S2 for all hard-coded values.\nRun the program \"MembraneSepDist.m\".\nSet Parameters.\n\tNOTE: A GUI will pop up with default parameters for the gradient threshold, scale, region of interest, and manual start. The default values can be changed in the m-file, or they can be changed for each individual image.\n\t\nSet spatial derivative gradient threshold.\n\t\tNOTE: Higher values result in more points selected in centerline isolation. Values that are too high or too low (outside of a range of approximately 3.0-7.9) may result in computational inefficiency or an imprecise selection of centerline points yielding imprecise centerline isolation (See Figure 2A-C).\nSet scale in pixels/scale units.\nSet the spatial lower and upper limits for the region of interest.\n\t\tNOTE: By our laboratory's convention, the defined region of interest is between 30 and 105 nm from the edge of the GJ2,3,10.\nSet automatic/manual start. In the majority of cases, the algorithm accurately detects the starting point where the gap junction ends and perinexus begins. However, in some cases of irregularly-shaped perinexi, the user must identify the start point manually. Set this value to 0 for automatic, 1 for manual.\nSelect desired image.\n\tNOTE: The file select folder can be changed in the m-file.\nCrop the image to select the perinexus of interest.\n\t\nWhen the image comes up, the cursor will automatically change to a crosshair. Crop the image by dragging a box around the perinexus of interest (See Figure 3). The crop box can be adjusted by using the squares on the corners and sides to make it larger or smaller.",
    "When cropping, ensure the \"open\" end of the perinexus (furthest from the GJ, see Figure 3) is cropped so that the two membrane outlines reach the edge of the cropped image.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to make the image full-screen to more easily see the perinexus of interest and crop appropriately.\nSelect the final crop by double-clicking with the curser in between the opposing edges to be measured.\n\tNOTE: It is critical that the double-click be performed inside the perinexus. If the program fails to identify a centerline, restart the program and make sure the click occurs within the perinexus.\nObserve the final centerline after all dilations and erosions pop up for a final user evaluation of the program's efficacy.\n\tNOTE: A dialog box will appear on the screen while the program is running to inform the user that Matlab will be unable to process any additional commands until the program has finished. How long this process takes depends on array (image) size and computer processing power.\nIf manual start point is enabled, observe the image of the centerline pop up over the original anatomical image, along with a cross-hair cursor (see Figure 2E). Select a point outside of the perinexus near the desired start point.\n\tNOTE: The program will find the centerline point closest to the selected pixel and use that as the start point.\nRecord data.",
    "NOTE: Once the program has finished, the program will return a mapped centerline, plot of perinexal width as a function of distance from the edge of the GJ. Additionally, the program will return the average perinexal width up to 150 nm from the edge of the GJ as well as the average from within the defined region of interest at the Matlab command line. Wp values and distances from the GJ are stored in the variable \"WpList\" or the user can manually record them separately.\n4. Algorithm Troubleshooting\nIf the centerline is not properly identified (Figure 2A), open the figure \"Gmag\" and use the Index to identify an appropriate gradient threshold (Figure 2C).\nIf the start point is not properly identified, set the start point manually (See Protocol 3.8)."
