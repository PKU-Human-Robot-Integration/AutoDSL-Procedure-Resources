    "Treat Arabidopsis seedlings with paraquat Surface-sterilize the Arabidopsis seeds with 70% ethanol and then grow them on vertical 1/2 Murashige & Skoog square plates (1% agar) for 10 days under standard long daylight growth conditions (16:8 h light/dark cycle) (Weigel and Glazebrook, 2002).Lay the plates horizontally and then leave them in darkness for two days to allow the hypocotyl to grow upward quickly. After that, return the plates to long daylight conditions again to grow for another two days (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4642/bioprotoc-13-07-4642-g001.jpgFigure 1. Brief diagram of seedling growth and treatment process Note: On each plate, mutants and the Col-0 wildtype control were grown side-by-side. The growth procedure illustrated in Figure 1 will facilitate the subsequent paraquat treatment and root harvest. Roots mainly grow on the surface of the media and can easily be treated and harvested, while leaves do not touch the media surface. Use a pipette to add 10 mL of 10 μM paraquat slowly into the plates and let the paraquat distribute evenly on the media surface. Keep the plates horizontally in darkness for 6 h.Note: Use the same quantity of paraquat to treat each plate. The volume of paraquat should be enough to submerge the media surface but not enough to touch the leaves. Harvest roots and leaves separately. Rinse the materials shortly three times with distilled water, blot them dry with paper towels, and then weigh. For mutants and controls, it is better to use a similar weight of materials for further experiments.Freeze the materials in liquid nitrogen and store them at -80 °C for paraquat determination.Treat Arabidopsis protoplasts with paraquat Prepare protoplasts from the leaves of Arabidopsis grown under short daylight conditions (8:16 h light/dark cycle) for four weeks based on the method described previously (Yoo et al., 2007). Suspend the protoplasts in cold W5 buffer.",
    "Count the protoplasts using a hemocytometer. Remove the W5 buffer and adjust the protoplasts to a final concentration of 2 × 106 protoplasts/mL with paraquat treatment solution. Use at least 10 mL protoplasts for one assay.Incubate the protoplasts in darkness at room temperature for 3 h. Gently shake the protoplasts by hand every 20 min.Note: This step is to load the paraquat into the protoplasts. Centrifuge at 100 × g for 2 min at 4 °C and remove the supernatant carefully.Add 10 mL of wash buffer into the tube and resuspend the protoplasts gently.Repeat steps B4–B5 two more times.Note: The above steps can be used for paraquat uptake assay. The following steps are carried out for paraquat efflux assay. After the final wash, suspend the protoplasts in wash buffer again and aliquot them equally into several tubes. Each tube corresponds to one time point. Set at least three replicates for each time point. For this assay, we use 0, 10, 30, and 60 min time points. Keep the tubes in darkness at room temperature and start timing using a timer.At each time point, centrifuge the tubes as in step B4. Collect the supernatants and protoplasts, respectively.Freeze the samples in liquid nitrogen and then store them at -80 °C for paraquat determination.Paraquat extraction Use 1 × 106–2 × 106 protoplasts or 20–30 mg of plant tissues to determine paraquat content in a 2 mL centrifuge tube. Conduct three freeze-thaw cycles (freeze the protoplasts in liquid nitrogen for 1 min, then thaw them in a water bath at room temperature for 2 min) to rupture the protoplasts. For plant tissues, grind the materials into powder in liquid nitrogen.Add 800 µL of paraquat extraction solution into each tube.",
    "Sonicate each sample for 20 min (1 min on, 1 min off) in total on ice.Put the samples in a water bath at 60 °C for 30 min and then cool down to room temperature.Centrifuge at 13,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and collect the supernatant.Repeat steps C2–C5 and combine the supernatants together.Evaporate the organic solvents with a nitrogen blowing concentrator and store the dried samples at -80 °C until determination.Paraquat determination Take the samples from -80 °C and add 100 μL of the room-temperature redissolving solution into the 2 mL centrifuge tubes to dissolve the samples.Lightly flick the tubes several times until the samples are completely dissolved. Centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pipette 80 μL of the supernatant into a 2 mL amber screw vial with a 150 μL liner pipe.Inject 1 μL of the sample into the system with a Waters BEH HILIC column (1.7 μm particle size, 2.1 mm × 100 mm).Perform a linear gradient elution program using LC mobile phase consisting of solvent A and solvent B. Set the flow rate of the mobile phase at 0.4 mL/min to conduct a linear gradient elution program (7 min): 90% B hold for 1 min, 90% B decreased to 20% B in 1 min, 20% B hold for 2.3 min, 20% B increased to 90% B in 0.2 min, and 90% B hold for 2.5 min. (The procedure was 0 min, 90% B; 1 min, 90% B; 2 min, 20% B; 4.3 min, 20% B; 4.5 min, 90% B; and 7 min, 90% B.)Detect the samples in positive mode (ESI+) with multiple reaction monitoring mode on the LC-MS/MS system.",
    "Set the gas parameters in ion source, including ion source gas 1, ion source gas 2, and the curtain gas to 55, 55, and 35 psi, respectively. Set the temperature to 500 °C and the ion spray voltage to 5,500 V. Monitor two multiple reaction transitions of each analyte for quantification and confirmation of paraquat (186.0–171.0 for quantification and 93.2–171.3 for confirmation). The voltages of declustering potential and collision energy are compound-specific parameters. For paraquat, they are 100, 60, 25, and 17, respectively. Set other parameters to default values as recommended by the manufacturer.Integrate the chromatographic peak of the target analyte. Integration parameters were set to 9 and 1,000 points for the minimum peak width and height, and S/N integration threshold and baseline subtraction window were set to 3 and 2 min, respectively."
