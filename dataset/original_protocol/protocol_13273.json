    "The Animal Experimental Ethics Committee at Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine reviewed and authorized all study protocols (approval number CUTCM-2021-23), and all operations of this protocol followed the committee's guidelines. New Zealand male young and strong white rabbits (n = 15) were selected weighing 2.5 ± 0.2 kg, provided by Chengdu Dashuo Experimental Animal Co., Ltd., experimental animal license number: SCXK (Su) 2017-0002. Standard animal housing conditions were 20-26 °C, 50%-70% humidity, alternating 12-h light and dark cycles, free diet, and water intake. The blank group included rabbits without any processing (no surgical incision and puncture of the IVD).\n1. Establishment of the IDD rabbit model\nNOTE: The following protocols were used to establish the IDD model.\nEnsure the rabbits in the model and Tuina groups were fixed on an autopsy table and restrained in a prone position. Shave the right lower lumbar spine (the surgical area and prepare for skin treatment.\nAnesthetize the rabbits intravenously at the ear margins using 3% pentobarbital sodium solution at a rate of 1.2 mL/kg, depending on their body weight. Pay attention to the rabbit's respiratory rate and eye pupil changes during anesthesia and push the drug as slowly as possible.\nPlace the anesthetized rabbit onto the sterile operating table in a prone position with the spine squared and the right side of the rabbit facing the operator.\nDisinfect the skin preparation with iodine and then use a scalpel to make an incision 3 cm from the median spine line, approximately 5 cm in length. Pluck away the skin, fascia, and muscles, avoid obvious blood vessels, and feel the fingers in the direction of the spine to reach the lumbar vertebral segments.",
    "Visualize the right segment of the lumbar spine with the aid of a light source. If any oozing blood obscures the view, remove it with a sterile dry cotton ball. Select a 16 G bone puncture needle (see Table of Materials). After removing the inner core of the puncture needle, wrap the end of the needle of the outer needle with a folded sterile gauze block and place it against the palm of the puncturing surgeon's hand.\nHold the needle in place by pinching the body with five fingers, and then vertically puncture the right side of the disc in the L3-L6 lumbar segment, respectively.\nAfter the successful puncture, rotate the needle in a circle once, leave for 10 s, and then withdraw. After inserting the insert back into the puncture needle, push out a white gelatinous nucleus pulposus tissue.\nSuture the fascial and cortical layers, and disinfect the incision. Administer a dose of 400,000 U/animal of potassium penicillin intramuscularly for 7 days to prevent postoperative infection.\nPerform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and obtain images to determine whether the model is successful. Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations using a SPEC 0.35-T imager. Acquire T2-weighted images (T2WIs) in the sagittal plane with the following settings: fast spin echo (SE) sequence with time to repetition (TR) of 3100 ms, time to echo (TE) of 115 ms, section thickness of 3 mm, and gap of 0.8 mm.\n2. Using the finger guard\nSterilize the operator's hand and carefully place the finger guard on the right hand. Adjust the gloves so that the sensor hidden in the finger belly of the finger guard can face the operator's finger belly for better information acquisition.",
    "Insert the end of the sensor on the finger guard into the interface of the circuit board and make sure that the connection is stable so as not to interrupt the transmission of information during operation.\nUse the universal serial bus (USB)-C type cable to connect the computer to the input port of the circuit board of the finger sleeve and adjust the position of the transmission cable so that it will not break away from the contact during operation or the operator will not get tied up.\nOpen the software on the computer system. Ensure to connect the finger guard to the computer before opening the software.\nIn the Sensor Range (N) selection box on the left-hand side of the software interface, click on the Down button and 10N to limit the sensor's measurement range. When it is ready, it is possible to see a certain force on the dynamic monitoring chart: the contact pressure between the operator's finger and the finger guard. Click on Tare on the system to zero the force.\nKeep the operator's force constant so the force curve remains at the desired value.\nMonitor the force curve and adjust the force level according to the curve change.\nAt the end of the operation, click on the Export Chart Date on the software to export the information table, which reflects the force levels for each time period.\n3. Tuina operation methods\nIn order to avoid errors caused by differences in proficiency, accuracy, and intensity of the acupuncture points, appoint the same person for all Tuina interventions.\n\tNOTE: The operator must be a trained practitioner who has been practicing Tuina for at least 5 years.",
    "Gently place the operator's left hand on the back of the rabbit's shoulder and hold it in place to prevent the rabbit's torso from struggling and moving during the procedure.\n\t\nIf the rabbit becomes nervous and moves around during the procedure, briefly calm down the rabbit before the Tuina operation. Use the right hand to operate, trying to keep the shoulders, waist, and wrists as relaxed as possible.\n\t\tNOTE: The shoulders should hang naturally, the elbows should be naturally flexed, and the wrists should be flexible and not tense and stiff.\nKneading and pointing of the acupuncture points. Knead the Pishu (BL20), Sanjiaoshu (BL22), and Shenshu (BL23) points on the left side of the spine. Place the belly of the thumb on the acupuncture point and the remaining fingers naturally on the contralateral muscular skin to anchor the thumb and the remaining four fingers in the gesture.\n\tNOTE: Positioning of acupuncture points:\n\tBL20: 1.5 cun(approximately 15 mm) lateral to the posterior midline on the lower border of the spinous process of the 11th thoracic vertebra.\n\tBL22: 1.5 cun (approximately 15 mm) lateral to the posterior midline on the lower border of the spinous process of the 1st lumbar vertebra.\n\t​BL23: 1.5 cun (approximately 15 mm) lateral to the posterior midline on the lower border of the spinous process of the 2nd lumbar vertebra.\nPress the point once and knead it 3 times for one cycle. During the kneading operation, suspend and flex the wrist, with the forearm actively applying force, driving the thumb to apply rhythmic, circular pressure to the acupuncture point with a force of 8 N and a frequency of 30 cycles/min.",
    "For the point-pressing operation, place the thumb perpendicular to the skin of the acupuncture point and slowly increase the force to 10 N. Then press until the skin of the white rabbit is depressed by 0.5 cm before slowly decreasing the pressure. Perform this action on each acupuncture point for 1 min.\nFlick the erector spinae muscles.\n\t\nFlick the vertical spinal muscles on the left lower back. Place the fingers on the lateral aspect of the erector spinae muscles, and place the remaining four fingers s naturally on the opposite side, with appropriate pressure applied vertically to a depth of approximately 0.5 cm.\nRelax the wrist and wrist joints, and use the force of the swinging arm to drive the thumb to the inner side of the muscle in a lateral plucking motion perpendicular to the direction of the muscle fibers, as if plucking a string. Pluck a muscle three times in a cycle, slowly moving the position from top to bottom. Ensure that the force is 10 N, and the frequency is 30 cycles/min, with 2 min for each side.\n\tNOTE: Plucking one muscle for a long time is not allowed.\nKnead each side of the rabbit at the three acupuncture points and flick for 5 min, for a total of 10 min on both sides, once a day, 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Take care to avoid the surgical incision when operating on the right side.\nBe precise when searching for acupuncture points, preferably according to bony markings.",
    "NOTE: It is important to note that, unlike humans, the white rabbit has 7 lumbar vertebrae, and the position of the lumbar vertebrae segments can be viewed on the basis of the images, and that the lumbar vertebrae are different from the thoracic vertebrae to the touch. In addition, there is a distinct indentation at the acupuncture point of touch. Observing the white rabbit's condition during manipulation will also be helpful, as this will help when searching for the acupuncture point. When the correct acupuncture point is touched, the white rabbit's muscles will appear in a tense state.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
