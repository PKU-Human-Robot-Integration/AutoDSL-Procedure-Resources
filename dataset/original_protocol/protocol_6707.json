    "Nestlet shredding testHouse mice individually for at least 7 days prior to the test. Make sure that housing conditions fulfill common standards like controlled lighting (in our case 12:12 h light-dark), temperature and humidity as well as low noise level, enriched cage environment and provision of chow and water ad libitum.24 h prior to the test, remove any material for nesting and environmental enrichment from the cage of test mice.On the testing day, relocate testing animals to the test area. Make sure the animals are accustomed to their environment to avoid distraction, for example by unfamiliar smells. This can be achieved by performing the test in a separated space of the room, in which the mice are housed. Alternatively, habituate mice to the test area on the days prior to testing for a minimum of 1 h per day.Remove food and water from the test animal’s cage and replace the lid by a transparent object with a smooth surface, such as a (glass or plexiglass) plate, to prevent mice from climbing during the test time.Take a nestlet using a forceps, weigh it and place it in the test animal’s cage.Ensure documentation by taking a photo at the beginning of the trial. Alternatively, an automated video system (e.g., VideoTrack, ViewPoint or similar) may be used. Make sure to document identifying information of the tested animal (e.g., by picturing the cage label including the mouse ID prior to picturing the nestlet).Start the timer. During the observation period of 30 min, keep a distance of at least 1 m from the test area.After 30 min, stop the trial and gently remove the test animal from the cage. Make sure all nestlet material remains in the cage.Document the state after the end of the trial using the camera (Figure 1).",
    "Remove the nestlet and weigh it. If the nestlet is torn into several pieces, use the largest one. Do not include pieces that fall off during removal of the nestlet, but do not deliberately try to shake off loose material.Store the nestlet in a plastic bag for documentation. Do not forget to label the bag with the mouse ID.When testing animals sequentially, alternate between treatment groups to avoid bias in your analysis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3863/bioprotoc-10-24-3863-g001.jpgFigure 1. Nestlet shredding in a cohort of wild type and ether lipid-deficient (“Gnpat KO”) mice.  A. Nestlets after the 30 min-observation period are documented for all tested animals (n = 9 per genotype). Numbers inside the panels indicate the test ID (black: wild type; red: Gnpat KO). Note the markedly higher shredding activity of wild type compared with Gnpat KO mice. B. The difference in nestlet weight before and after the trial was calculated for each test animal and results are shown as individual data points. Grey bars indicate the mean value. Numbers next to the data points designate the mouse test ID, as defined in (A). Statistical testing was performed using Mann-Whitney U-test (**p < 0.01). The quantitative data shown here have also been presented in our previous publication (            Dorninger et al., 2019a).Nest building testHouse mice individually for at least 7 days prior to the test. Make sure that housing conditions fulfill common standards like controlled lighting (in our case 12:12 h light-dark), temperature and humidity as well as low noise level, enriched cage environment and provision of chow and water ad libitum. Testing can be performed in the animals’ standard housing room, which ensures maximal familiarization of mice with their environment.24 h prior to the test, remove any nesting material from the cage of test mice.",
    "Avoid any setting that could provoke a bias in your test results (e.g., spatially separating different test groups).On the test day (preferably in the evening), supply every test mouse with a nestlet. Distribute nestlets using a clean forceps.Document the state at the beginning of the trial by taking a photo.After 20 h, document the status quo (“t20”). Take care not to disorganize the nest – thus, avoid any agitation of the animals. Therefore, to take a photo, wait till the mouse either sits steadily in its nest (make sure that the nest is clearly visible) or leaves its nest voluntarily. Do not dislocate mice forcibly from the nest. Make sure to document identifying information of the tested animal (e.g., by picturing the cage label including the mouse ID prior to picturing the nestlet).After 48 h, end the trial by moving test mice to a clean cage. Document the final nest and avoid disorganizing it."
