    "All animal procedures were performed in compliance with the experimental guidelines approved by the regional authorities (State Agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection; reference number 84-02.04.2014.A059) and conform to the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and the European directive 2010/63/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.\n1. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy-optical Coherence Tomography\nNOTE: The protocol for cSLO-OCT measurement is adaptable for all strains of laboratory mice and rats.\nSet-up and pre-imaging preparations\nNOTE: The system configuration of the OCT device used in this protocol has already been described elsewhere31.\nRodent preparation for inhalant anesthesia\nPlace the rodent in an induction chamber and set the vaporizer to an isoflurane concentration of 2% at 2 L/min O2.\nCheck if the rodent is anesthetized by pinching the tail, remove it from the chamber and wrap it in paper towel to keep it warm.\nPlace the rodent in the custom holder33 and hook the maxillary incisors on the integrated bite bar of the mouth piece, connected to the vaporizer (2.5% isoflurane at 2 L/min O2).\nApply one drop of Phenylephrine 2.5%-Tropicamide 0.5% on each eye for pupillary dilation.\nWipe off any excess liquid of eye drops after 1 min and lubricate the eyes with methyl-cellulose based ophthalmic gel (e.g., hypromellose 0.3% eye drops) to avoid drying out and turbidity of the cornea.\nPlace custom contact lens (+4 diopters) on the mouse eye by hand or using forceps. Cover the rat eye with a glass plate (e.g., round 12 mm diameter glass coverslip) without optical properties to assure a plane surface.\nNOTE: Monitor respiratory rate during anesthesia. Increase or decrease Isoflurane concentration if required.\nMeasurement and analysis",
    "NOTE: Make sure to perform and report the OCT measurements in line with the APOSTEL recommendations34 and perform quality control according to the OSCAR-IB consensus criteria35. As these recommendations have been developed for human OCT images, some criteria are not or only partially applicable.\n\t\nTo image the left eye, position the holder as presented in Figure 1A to ensure that the left eye bulb of the rodent faces the camera.\nPress the Start button in the right corner of the control panel display to start the acquisition mode.\nSet the filter lever to R and select BR+OCT for Blue reflectance fundus imaging and B-scan acquisition on the control panel.\nSet the focus distance to approx. 38 diopters using the focus knob on the back of the camera and zoom in on the retina until the OCT scan is visible on the screen.\nNOTE: At the first measurement, the reference arm has to be adapted for rodent measurement. Press the combination Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O and adjust the value of the reference arm in the open window until the OCT-scan appears on the screen.\nTo ensure a beam path through the middle of the pupil with an orthogonal angle to the retina in all planes, position the optic disc in the middle of the illuminated field (BR) and adjust the horizontal and vertical line B-scans to a horizontal level by rotating/turning the holder (Figure 1B) or moving the camera.\nSelect the volume scan mode and set it to 25 B-scans in high-resolution mode at 50 automatic real-time tracking (ART, rasterized from 50 averaged A-Scans) on the software screen.\nCenter the middle of the volume scan grid on the optic disc and start acquisition by pressing the black sensitivity knob and then AQUIRE on the control panel.",
    "Set the filter lever to A, select Blue Auto Florescence (BAF) on the control panel and adjust image brightness with the sensitivity knob. Press the sensitivity knob and then AQUIRE to image fluorescent cells (e.g., EGFP) or auto fluorescent deposits.\nApply ophthalmic gel on the eye of the rodent to prevent dehydration and put the animal in a separate cage with a heat source.\nSupervise the rodent until it is fully recovered from anesthesia, in a separate cage and individually housed. When the animal is ambulatory, return it to the home cage.\nFor analysis of the volume scans, use the automated segmentation of the OCT device’s software by right-clicking on the scan and select Segmentation then All Layers. Make sure that the quality of the OCT images is sufficient and define quality cutoffs for each set of experiments, e.g., >20 decibels.\nPerform manual correction of the layers by double clicking on the desired scan, select Thickness Profile and click on Edit Layer Segmentations. Select one layer, e.g., press ILM for Inner limiting membrane, and, if necessary, correct the green line by moving the red dots by drag and drop to the correct position.\nNOTE: Make sure the investigator performing the manual correction is blinded for the experimental groups.\nSelect the tab Thickness Map and choose the 1, 2, 3 mm early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) grid. Center the inner circle on the optic disc (Figure 2, left).\nCalculate the thickness of retinal layers from the thickness values provided by the software for the different retinal sectors of interest. To compute the mean thickness values from volume scans, use the whole 1, 2, 3 mm ETDRS grid, which covers an angle of approximately 25°, excluding the inner 1 mm circle, which contains the optic disc (Figure 2, right).",
    "Perform the statistical analysis using adequate software. If both eyes of an animal are included, consider a statistical model accounting for within subject inter-eye correlations (e.g., generalized estimating equations or mixed linear models), as the eyes of one subject are statistically dependent36.\n2. Optokinetic Response\nNOTE: In the following, a detailed manual for OKR measurements of mice and rats is provided, which can be adapted to individual specific needs.\nSet-up and pre-measurement preparations\nTurn on the computer. After the system has booted, turn on the screens of the testing chamber as described in more detail elsewhere37.\nSelect a suitable platform for the measurement of mice or rats.\nNOTE: The platform size is selected based on the body size of the rodent. The animal should be able to sit properly on the platform without the ability to walk around.\nOpen the pre-settings window by double-clicking on the software, select New group and choose the group name, the number of subjects, the species and strains. Select a variable stimulus: spatial/temporal frequency, contrast sensitivity, speed or orientation in the drop-down menu, then press Create New Group.\nFocus on the platform by manipulating the focus ring of the camera on top of the chamber and calibrate the system by aligning (drag and drop) the red circle around the black circle on the platform.\nMeasurement and analysis\nPlace the animal on the platform, let it adapt to the environment for ~5 min. Lift the animal back on platform if it drops (Figure 3A).\nSelect Subject number and Condition on the top right corner of the software screen (Figure 3B). One stimulus is variable, the other stimuli are kept constant. This is confirmed by the Open lock or Closed lock symbol next to the stimulus.",
    "Start measurement by selecting ◄ for Yes or ■ for No, if the animal tracks or does not track, respectively.\nNOTE: Clockwise tracking corresponds to the left and counterclockwise tracking to the right eye. The software randomly changes the direction of the moving grid.\nSelect the step size of the stimulus manually by clicking on the Up and Down arrows next to the variable stimulus or let it adapt automatically by the software if stimulus threshold converges.\nFor optimal results, animate the animal, e.g., by high whistling sounds and blanking, by clicking the black or white box symbol on the software screen. Perform these actions repeatedly in the case of prolonged measurements.\nFor data analysis, select the Summary tab and click on File | Export Table/Graph to export the desired data set.\nPerform the statistical analysis using the desired software (see also Step 1.3.15)."
