    "Leaves infected with Phakopsora pachyrhizi uredospores were randomly sampled in the field. Alternatively, uredospores of a determined isolate were propagated on plants under greenhouse conditions. Immediately after sampling, leaves were stored in a dry plastic or paper bag at room temperature up to four days. However, better results are expected from material recently collected or stored under refrigeration.In the laboratory, uredospores were tapped off of the leaves into a suitable dry tube using a paint-brush, as shown in Video 2. This step should be done a short time before inoculation, that means, the time necessary to carry out 3-5 steps. The amount of uredospores depends on the amount of leaves that will be included in the experiment. To have an estimate please see steps 3 and 6. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Uredospores tapped off of the leaves using a paint-brush Fifty ml uredospore suspension was prepared using sterile distilled water, 1 drop of Tween 20 and uredospores to a final concentration of 1 x 105 spores/ml. The concentration of uredospores was estimated using a Neubauer chamber. The Tween 20 was added using a pipette, as shown in Video 3. Fifty ml solution can be used to infect approximately 50 leaves. <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. One drop of Tween 20 using a 1 ml pipette Soybean transgenic and non-transgenic plants were cultivated in a plant culture room at 26 ± 1 °C with a 16/8 h light/dark cycle at a light intensity of 22.5 µE/m2/s. Fully expanded trifoliate leaves with similar size and position were collected from plants of the same age. The newest fully expanded leaf of 2-month-old plants (V5 or V6 stages) was preferentially used, but plants in other growth stages may be also used. From this step forward, the material was aseptically manipulated in a laminar flow cabinet.",
    "The leaves were rinsed (quick submersion) in sterile distilled water and rapidly dried on sterile filter paper. Each leaflet was cut into 5 cm x 5 cm pieces and individually placed with the abaxial side upwards in a sterile Petri dish (Ø 9 cm) containing filter paper saturated with distilled water to maintain high humidity (Figure 3). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150718/20150718045922_1610.jpgFigure 3. Soybean leaf piece with the abaxial surface upwards in a Petri dish containing filter paper saturated with waterEach leaf piece was inoculated by spraying 1 ml of the uredospore suspension (105 spores/ml). The uredospore suspension was mixed immediately before each inoculation. A distance of 10 cm was maintained between the hand sprayer and the leaf piece.The Petri dishes were incubated in a growth chamber at 20 °C with a 12/12 h light/dark cycle for 12 days.The material was visually evaluated for the presence of lesions and pustules every 2 days during the incubation period. After 12 days of incubation, leaves showing signals of other diseases or rotting were eliminated (Figure 4). The remaining material was visually classified according to the lesion type (immune, reddish brown or tan) present on the abaxial side of the leaf (Figure 1). Additionally, the number of lesions, the number of lesions with pustules, the number of pustules per lesion, the total number of pustules and the total number of opened pustules present on each leaf piece was recorded under a stereomicroscope (see Note 4; Figure 5). Finally, two infected areas of 1 cm x 1 cm were determined in each leaf piece and cut off. Each 1 cm2 piece was placed in a microtube containing 500 µl water and vortexed vigorously for 1 min. The mean number of uredospores per cm2 was estimated under a stereomicroscope using a Neubauer chamber.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150718/20150718050013_4382.pngFigure 4.",

Tree leaf pieces from the same plant and at least two plants from each transgenic event were used. Non-transformed plants of the same genetic background were used as a control. Ideally, a susceptible and a partially resistant variety should be used as positive and negative controls of the experimental conditions."
