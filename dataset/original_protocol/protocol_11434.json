  "procedures": [
    "1. TIC Preparation for Quick Microscopic Assessment Using Normal Glass Slides\nPerform the TIC preparation as soon as possible after clinical pathological tissue materials are available. If TIC specimens cannot immediately be prepared, keep the tissue materials covered with saline moistened sterile-gauze and store in the refrigerator to prevent drying of tissues.\nPrepare 5 mm3 tissue material such as solid tumors (e.g., liver, lung, and breast tissues) clinically obtained by surgery or endoscopy.\n\t\nGently wipe the tissue with sterile-gauze coated with physiological saline and remove blood, if the tissue surface has a lot of blood.\nFor microscopic specimens such as biopsy material, keep the sample moistened with sterile-gauze soaked in physiological saline.\nCut and trim the normal tissue with a trimming knife and expose the surface of the tumor lesion, if the tumor masses are not visible grossly.\nTouch the tumor surface of the resected specimens onto a normal glass slide several times with gloved hands. Visually confirm the touched area is over 80% of the normal glass slide.\nLightly press the normal glass slide against a polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) membrane slide and rub gently 2 - 3 times with gloved hands. Visually confirm the cells are transferred from the normal glass slide to the PEN membrane slide.\nAir-dry both the glass and PEN membrane slides for 5 min at room temperature.\nStain the normal glass slide for direct cytological examination. Dip the glass slides with fixative solution for 5 s, and then stain with Giemsa staining solution for 15 s.\nAssess and screen the tumor contents and cellularity on the normal glass slide entirely with a microscope for quick assessment. Evaluate tumor cells based on several criteria; nuclear enlargement, abnormal karyotype, abundant chromatin, unequal distribution of cells, ratio of nuclear component/cytoplasmic component, cell size, and cell polarity.",
    "2. Preparation of the PEN Membrane Slide Film for Genetic Testing\nIf the sample shows tumor cellularity over 60% by quick microscopic assessment (step 1.8), cut the tumor-touched film of the PEN membrane slides for DNA extraction with a knife and gloved hands. Transfer the cut film to a sterile microcentrifuge tube with a pincette and gloved hands.\nIf the tumor cellularity was determined as low (less than 60% of the tumor contents) by quick microscopic assessment (step 1.8), use laser capture microdissection and obtain tumor samples.\n\t\nPerform Giemsa staining to assess the tumor cells using standard protocols.\nCut the film of the PEM membrane slide by appropriate laser capture microdissection.\nTransfer the cut film to a sterile microcentrifuge tube with a pincette and gloved hands.\nStore the film-containing microcentrifuge tube at 4 °C until DNA extraction (the protocol can be paused here).\n3.
