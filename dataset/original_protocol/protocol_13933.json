  "procedures": [
    "Northern Sydney Local Health District Animal Ethics Committee has approved all procedures mentioned in this protocol. Mice are housed and cared for in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia Revised 2010). For all experiments 10-12-week-old, male C57BL/6 mice were utilized.\nNOTE: To induce post-traumatic OA, surgical destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) in the right stifle joint was performed. Detailed information regarding this animal model was published by Glasson et al.18. In short, general anesthesia is induced in an induction chamber using isoflurane and thereafter maintained using a nose cone. The surgical leg is shaved with a razor blade and the surgical site is washed and swabbed with ethanol to minimize contamination. The animal is then moved to the operating microscope and placed on a sterile towel and the leg draped with sterile paper drape to isolate the surgical site and minimize contamination. Using the microscope, a 0.5 cm medial para-patella arthrotomy is made, the patella luxated laterally, and the infra-patella fat pad elevated to expose the medial menisco-tibial ligament, which is transected with dissecting forceps. The joint is flushed with sterile saline to remove any blood and the wound is closed in three layers – joint capsule, subcutaneous tissue (using suture material) and skin (using surgical tissue glue). Methods described in this protocol, however, can be applied to other models and methods for inducing OA. OA can be induced in either side of the animal, and when harvesting tissues, it is important to harvest the ipsilateral (draining) lymph nodes.\n1. Isolation of the spleen, contralateral bone marrow, ipsilateral lymph nodes draining the stifle and synovial tissue",
    "Euthanize the mouse by cervical dislocation. Place the mouse in a supine position under a dissecting microscope and wipe the chest, abdomen and legs with 70% ethanol. Carefully open the skin on the midline for the length of the abdomen using straight scissors leaving the abdominal cavity intact.\nGently pull the skin on the right side of the animal away from the underlying muscle leaving the subcutaneous adipose tissue attached to the skin. Normally, gentle traction alone will separate the skin and underlying adipose tissue from the muscle. Sporadic adherences should be cut through with fine scissors in order to keep the tension necessary to separate tissues to a minimum and reduce the chance of harming the lymph nodes. Identify a crossing of three vessels by gently teasing out the adipose tissue located at the thigh using two curved fine forceps. The inguinal lymph node is located at the crossing and can be identified by its ovoid shape and slightly darker color.\nRemove the inguinal lymph node using fine dissecting forceps. Be careful not to rupture the capsule. Remove the remaining fat on the surface of the lymph node with the forceps.\nOpen the abdominal cavity and identify the spleen. Cut out the spleen with fine scissors. Gently pull the intestines aside to expose the aorta and its bifurcation being careful not to harm them, in order to minimize risk of contamination. The iliac lymph node is located at the terminal segment of the abdominal aorta and the origin of the common iliac artery. Remove right iliac lymph node and proceed as described in 1.3.",
    "Gently remove the skin of both hind limbs. Dissect the left femur by cleaning it from muscle tissue using the blade and fine scissors. Carefully disconnect both the stifle and hip joint leaving the whole bone intact and remove the femur.\nIdentify the patella tendon of the right stifle joint, then remove the adjoining muscle tissue proximal to this using fine scissors until approximately 5mm of quadriceps tendon proximal to the patella is exposed. Thereafter, cut through the quadriceps tendon approximately 3-4mm proximal to the patella to form a handle and using fine forceps gently pull it away from the joint. This will render the edges of the joint capsule attachment to femur visible, and using a scalpel blade carefully cut along the edges of the joint capsule on both sides, starting at the femur going towards the tibia, in order to maximize the amount of synovial membrane that is harvested. Whilst cutting it is important to maintain a gentle traction on the quadriceps tendon and pause when the synovial tissue block is only attached to the tibia. At this stage the intraarticular fat pad is now clearly visible distal to the patella and can be gently detached from the joint and anterior aspect of the menisci using the blade. Thereafter, cut along the remaining part of the joint capsule (tibial portion) to remove the synovial tissue block.\n\tNOTE: This step has to be done very precisely to allow reliable results. After completing the dissection, the “synovial tissue block” should consist of the patella, patella tendon, infrapatellar fat pad, supra- and infrapatellar recesse synovial lining and associated joint capsule anterior to the collateral ligaments. Keep all tissues moist during dissection using 0.9% saline solution.",
    "NOTE: Place each synovial tissue block sample in a separate well of a labelled 24-well plate containing 1.5 ml of RPMI 1640 medium. Combine both the iliac and the inguinal lymph node into one well and pool tissues from two mice. \n2. Generation of single cell suspensions from each tissue\nNOTE: In order to ensure sufficient cell numbers for flow analysis synovial tissues from two mice need to be pooled. In the current protocol, pool all tissues from the same two mice in order to maintain analogy. Furthermore, iliac and inguinal lymph nodes were combined for each animal resulting in a total of 4 lymph nodes for each sample. In general, cell numbers in spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes from one animal are sufficient to conduct flow analysis and the protocol can be applied. However, when using tissues from only one animal lysing times might need to be adjusted.\nThe spleen\n\t\nPlace the two pooled spleens onto a 70 µm cell strainer on top of a 15 mL tube. Gently macerate the spleens through the mesh filter using a sterile 3 mL syringe plunger. Flush the strainer frequently with a total of 6 mL of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS.\nSpin the cells (500 x g, 5 min, RT) and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer. Incubate for 5 min at RT and stop the reaction by diluting the lysis buffer with 10 mL of PBS. Spin the cells (500 x g, 5 min, RT) and repeat this step once or until no more RBC are in the pellet.\n\t\tNOTE: Refilter the suspension using a 30 µm cell strainer into a new 15 mL tube between the two rounds of lysing to remove coagulated cells.",
    "After lysing is complete, spin the cells (500 x g, 5 min, RT), discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1 mL of PBS. Count the number of live cells on a hemocytometer using Trypan blue exclusion.\nThe lymph nodes\n\t\nPlace the four pooled lymph nodes onto a 70 µm cell strainer on top of a 15 mL tube. Gently tease the lymph nodes apart into a single cell suspension by pressing with a sterile 3 mL syringe plunger. Flush the strainer frequently with a total of 6 mL of RPMI with 10% FBS.\nSpin the cells (500 x g, 5 min, RT), discard supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 µL of PBS. Refilter the suspension using a 30 µm cell strainer into a new 15 mL tube to remove coagulated cells. Count the number of live cells on a hemocytometer using Trypan blue exclusion.\nThe bone marrow\n\t\nCarefully grasp the intact femur using a tissue thumb forceps without fracturing it. Cut off the very end of the proximal femur with a sharp scissor in order to facilitate flushing of the bone. Turn the femur around and position a 23 G needle in the middle of the intercondylar notch of the femur. Whilst applying gentle pressure rotate the needle between thumb and index finger in order to drill a hole in the intercondylar notch to enter the bone cavity.\n\t\tNOTE: Sometimes particles of the bone can obstruct the needle after drilling the hole, to avoid unnecessary high pressure during flushing a change of needle before flushing is recommended.",
    "Flush the bone with 6 mL of RPMI with 10% FBS (or until the flush turns white) using a 10 mL syringe with a 23 G needle onto a 70 µm cell strainer that is placed on a 15 mL tube. Gently press the bone marrow through the cell strainer with a plunger of a 3 mL syringe and rinse the strainer with another 3 mL of RPMI.\n\t\tNOTE: The bones should appear white once all the marrow has been flushed out completely.\nSpin the cells (500 x g, 5 min, RT) and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of RBC lysis buffer. Incubate for 5 min at RT and stop the reaction by diluting the lysis buffer with 10 mL of PBS.\nSpin the cells (500 x g, 5 min, RT), discard supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of PBS. Refilter the suspension using a 30 µm cell strainer into a new 15 mL tube to remove coagulated cells. Count the number of live cells on a hemocytometer using Trypan blue exclusion.\nThe synovial tissue\n\t\nDice the two synovial tissue blocks into tiny pieces with a fine surgical scissor. Transfer the samples with medium into a 15 mL tube. Rinse the old well with additional 0.5 mL of RPMI to get remaining cells and synovial tissues, transfer to falcon tube (final volume 2 mL).\n\t\tTIP: Use a transfer pipette and cut of the tip where the diameter widens in this step.\nReconstitute enzyme and aliquot according to manufacturer instructions (e.g., Liberase). Add sufficient enzyme to result in a final concentration of 1 Unit/mL (a total of 2 Units per sample). Digest at 37 °C for 2 h using a MACS rotator.",
    "Stop the digestion by adding 8 mL of RPMI with 10% FBS and filter cell suspension through a 70 µm cell strainer into a new 15 mL tube. Rinse the old 15 mL tube with another 5 mL of RPMI with 10% FCS medium and filter cell suspension through same cell strainer into the new tube (15 mL final volume).\nSpin the cells (500 x g, 10 min, RT), discard supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 µL of PBS. Count the number of live cells on a hemocytometer using Trypan blue exclusion.\n3. Allocation of cells\nLabel two 96-well plates (U-bottom shape) with type of tissue, animal ID, and the designated antibody panel. A total of two antibody panels are used in this protocol: Monocyte subset panel (extracellular staining) and T-cell subset panel (extra- and intracellular staining).\nProvide 5 x 105 cells per well using the respective single cell suspensions.\n\tNOTE: When setting up the experiment, assess the absolute number of cells that is expected per group and tissue type (treated animals have a higher cell count in tissues than control animals). When resuspending the cell pellet during the last step of generating single cell suspensions, choose an appropriate amount of PBS in order to end up with a concentration of 5 x 105 per 200 µL. The 96-well plate used here can hold a maximum of 300 µL and typically, 200 µL is ideal to minimize the risk of cross-contamination due to spillage.\nFor each panel and tissue type, distribute at least 5 x 105 cells as unstained controls in wells that have been clearly marked.\n4. Monocyte Subset Panel",
    "Perform viability staining: Spin cells (500 x g, 5 min, 4 °C) using a plate spinner and wash the cells once with 200 µL of 1x PBS. Prepare a stock solution of cell-impermeant amine-reactive dye (viability stain) diluted 1:50 in 1x PBS.Thereafter, resuspend the cell pellets with 100 µL of this stock solution resulting in an absolute volume of 2 µL of viability stain per well. Incubate for 15 min at 4 °C protected from light.\n\tNOTE: The optimal amount of viability stain needed should be determined by performing a dose titration curve. In addition, diluted viability stain stock solution should be used in a single day and not be stored. Refer to manufacturer’s instructions for more information on how to reconstitute, dilute and store the viability stain.\nDuring the incubation, prepare the cocktail of antibodies in an appropriate volume of FACS buffer (Ca2+ and Mg+ free PBS containing 0.1%BSA and 0.02% sodium azide). Wash the cells twice with 200 µL of FACS buffer, centrifuge (500 x g, 5 min, 4 °C) and resuspend each pellet with 100 µL of the antibody mixture or appropriate control mixture. Incubate for 30 min at 4 °C protected from light.\n\tNOTE: Please be aware that sodium azide is toxic to cells. In the current protocol the concentration of sodium azide in the flow buffer is very low (0.02%) and samples are run immediately after staining thus, not causing any issue. If downstream functional assays of sorted cells are planned, it might be beneficial to make up fresh FACS buffer each day of experiments and not use any sodium azide. When using a multitude of antibodies, it is advised to add an appropriate amount of “Brilliant Stain Buffer” to the cocktail of antibodies to enhance results.",
    "Wash the cells twice with 200 µL of FACS buffer and resuspend the cells in 250 µL of FACS + EDTA buffer (FACS buffer containing 1 mM EDTA). Transfer samples into labeled FACS tubes. Keep samples at 4 °C and protected from light until acquisition.\n\tNOTE: Immune cells have the tendency to be sticky. In order to minimize both the risk of blockage and number of doublets it is recommended to add 1 mM EDTA to the final flow buffer.\n5. T Cell subset panel\nPerform viability staining: Spin cells (500 x g, 5 min, 4 °C) using a plate spinner and wash the cells once with 200 µL of 1x PBS. Prepare a stock solution of cell-impermeant amine-reactive dye (viability stain) diluted 1:50 in 1x PBS. Thereafter, resuspend the cell pellets with 100 µL of this stock solution resulting in an absolute volume of 2 µL of viability stain per well. Incubate for 15 min at 4 °C protected from light.\nWhilst incubating the samples, prepare the extracellular staining antibody cocktail in an appropriate volume of 1x FACS buffer. Wash the cells twice with 200 µL of 1x FACS buffer, spin them down (500 x g, 5 min, 4 °C) and resuspend each pellet with 100 µL of the antibody mixture or appropriate control mixture. Incubate for 30 min at 4 °C protected from light.\nPerform the intracellular staining with a fixation and permeabilization kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. Wash the cells twice with 200 µL of 1x FACS buffer and resuspend in 200 µL of fixation buffer. Incubate for 40 min at 4 °C protected from light.",
    "During the incubation, prepare the cocktail of antibodies (intracellular staining) in an appropriate volume of 1x permeabilization and wash buffer. Collect cells by spinning (750 x g, 5 min, 4 °C) and wash cells twice with 200 µL of 1x perm/wash buffer.\n\tNOTE: Fixation and permeabilization results in cells that tend to be a bit harder to properly pellet. In order to minimize cell loss during the subsequent washing steps, increase the centrifugal force to 750 x g. Alternatively a longer spinning cycle could also be applied. However, this would result in a considerably longer time that is needed to prepare the cells.\nSpin cells (750 x g, 5 min, 4 °C) and resuspend each pellet with 100 µL of the antibody mixture or appropriate control mixture. Incubate for 40 min at 4 °C protected from light.\nWash the cells twice with 200 µL of 1x perm/wash buffer and resuspend the cells in 250 µL of FACS + EDTA buffer. Transfer samples into labeled FACS tubes. Keep samples at 4 °C and protected from light until acquisition.\n\tNOTE: For each antibody the optimal concentration needs to be determined by performing a dose titration curve. Concentration between antibodies can differ drastically: CD3 and CD80 was used with a dilution factor of 1:1, while CD11b and CD4 was used with a dilution factor of 1:6400. When titrating the antibody concentration use the same number of cells that will be used during the experiments.\n6. Compensation, appropriate controls and gating\nSetting up the experiment\n\t\nOnce the optimal antibody concentration has been determined run unstained and single stained controls for compensation to adjust for spectral overlap.",
    "NOTE: Run all compensation controls with both cells and compensation beads. Use whatever generates the brightest results (highest MFI of positive events) for compensation. MFI stands for mean fluorescence intensity and is often used to describe and define the mean intensity of the generated signal and thus, level of antibody expression.\nRun fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls and isotype controls when starting a new multicolor experiment. Further details regarding FMO have been previously published19.\nDetermine the optimal Forward Scatter Area (FSC-A) voltage and Side Scatter Area (SSC-A) voltage in order to detect the leukocyte population in unstained controls of each tissue type.\n\t\tNOTE: The fixation and permeabilization process alters the dimensions of the cell. Thus, the FSC-A and SSC-A voltages for the Monocyte Subset Panel and T Cell Subset Panel differ considerably. In order to find the optimal voltages for the T Cell Subset Panel, use cells that have been single stained with CD3 and back gate towards the leukocyte populations while adjusting the FSC-A and SSC-A values.\nGating strategy\n\t\nOnce the optimal FSC-A and SSC-A voltage has been determined, set up a primary gate on the leukocyte population.\n\t\tNOTE: Prior to each experiment calibrate the cytometer using calibration beads as per manufacturer’s instructions and run unstained beads. Leukocyte populations of different time points should have comparable FSC and SSC properties (slight differences between tissue types are expected and normal). If FSC and SSC varies considerable trouble shoot the cytometer and sample generation.\nExclude doublets: Plot FSC-A (y-axis) and FSC-H (x-axis). Singlets appear as a diagonal of this plot. Gate on singlets.\nExclude dead cell: Plot FVS510 (viability stain) (x-axis) and FSC-A (y-axis). Dead cells will appear as positive events, thus gate on live cells.",
    "NOTE: True negative cells will be visible in unstained controls. Thus, adjust this gate for each set of samples when running the unstained controls prior to stained samples. Further gating depends on the antibody panel and cell type that is investigated. Gating strategies for each panel used in this protocol can be found in Figure 1 and Figure 4, respectively.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
