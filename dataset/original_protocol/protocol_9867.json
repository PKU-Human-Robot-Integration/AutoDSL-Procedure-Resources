    "Gently transfer the iCMs from the cryovial to a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube using a 1 mL pipette tip.\nRinse the empty iCMs cryovial with 1 mL of room temperature plating medium to recover any residual cells. Transfer the 1 mL of plating medium rinse from the cryovial drop-wise over 90 sec to the 50 mL centrifuge tube containing the iCM cell suspension.\n\tNOTE: Gently swirl the tube while adding the medium to mix the solution completely and to decrease the osmotic shock on the thawed cells.\nSlowly add 8 mL of room temperature Plating Medium to the 50 mL centrifuge tube. Add the first 1 mL dropwise over 30 - 60 s. Then, add the remaining volume over the next 30 s. Gently swirl the centrifuge tube while adding the Plating medium. Gently mix the contents of the 50 mL centrifuge tube by inverting 2 - 3 times (avoiding vigorous shaking or vortexing).\nImmediately perform the cell counting using a hemocytometer and determine the viable cell density (in cells/mL).\nTake the FN-pre-coated T25 flasks and aspirate the FN-PBS solution without letting the flasks dry. To this add seeding volume of iCMs (1.6 x 106 viable iCMs in 8 mL room temperature plating medium).\nCulture iCMs in the incubator for 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nThaw the Maintenance Medium overnight at 4 °C a day before use.\nEquilibrate the Maintenance Medium in a 37 °C water bath and use immediately.\nAfter 2 days, move the iCMs T25 flasks under the biosafety cabinet.\nGently wash off dead cells and debris by gently pipetting the Plating Medium up and down 5 times.",
    "Aspirate the Plating Medium and replace with the 8 mL of pre-warmed Maintenance Medium. Place the T25 flasks back in the incubator. Replace the Maintenance Medium every other day and examine the confluency regularly.\n3. Cell isolation and counting\nStart by collecting first HCAECs and HCFs, and then iCMs by following steps 3.2-3.12.\nPrepare CS culture medium by mixing 10 mL of iCMs Maintenance Medium, 5 mL of Human Cardiac Fibroblast Medium and 5 mL of Meso Endo Growth Medium.\nRemove culture medium from each tissue flask containing HCFs and HCAECs and rinse once with 5 mL PBS for T75 flasks. Remove PBS.\nAdd 5 mL of 0.25% trypsin EDTA solution to each T75 flask and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nOnce cells detach, immediately neutralize the trypsin EDTA solution with 5 mL of culture medium.\nTransfer cell suspensions to a 15 mL tube and centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 4 min.\nRemove the supernatant carefully from each tube. Add 1 mL of CS medium to each cell pellet and resuspend them. Keep the tube on ice and count cells using Trypan Blue and a hemocytometer.\nRemove Maintenance Medium from tissue flasks containing iCMs and rinse once with 3 mL of PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin EDTA solution to each T75 flask and incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Check cells every minute until detached.\nOnce cells detach, immediately neutralize the trypsin EDTA solution with 4 mL of culture medium.\nTransfer cell suspensions to a 15 mL tube and centrifuge them at 300 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant carefully from each tube. Add 1 mL of culture medium to the cell pellet and resuspend it. Keep the tube on ice and count cells using Trypan Blue and a hemocytometer.",
    "4. CS generation and growth\nMix iCMs, HCFs and HCAECs in 2:1:1 ratio by plating 10,000 iCMs, 5,000 HCFs and 5,000 HCAECs per hanging drop culture containing 20 µL of CS medium. Adjust to the final volume for the total number of CSs.\nPipette 20 µL of cell suspension into each well of the 384 well HDC plate either manually or by using a robotic multichannel pipette for automated liquid handling.\nPipette 1.5 mL of sterile PBS in each side of the channel around the Hanging Drop Plate to prevent drying out CSs. Incubate HDC plate at 37 °C.\nExamine formation of CSs on a daily basis until a fully formed spheroid is observed in the majority of wells. Add 7.5 µL of CS medium to each well every other day until a CS is formed.\n5. CS embedding in collagen gels\nCollect CSs with a 1 mL pipette tip.\n\tNOTE: It is necessary to cut the tip of pipette around 0.2 cm from the edge before its use with a sterile sharp surface (either a scalpel or a scissor) to prevent any damage gel embedded spheroids during their collection.\nCollect the CS suspension into a 50 mL tube on ice.\nCentrifuge the tube at 300 x g for 5 min.\n\tNOTE: the pellet obtained must be kept on ice until use.\nPrepare a collagen gel solution (100 µL/well for 30 wells of 96 well plate) on ice using rat tail collagen and CS medium in a 3:7 ratio.\nRemove the supernatant from the tube containing CSs.\nMix the pelleted CSs within the collagen gel solution.\nAdd 1 µL/mL of 5 mM sodium hydroxide to the CS-collagen gel suspension and mix gently.",
