    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAnalyze the ligation sites and synthesis design\nTiming: [2 h]\nThis section describes the sequence analysis for disconnection sites.\nAnalyze ligation sites.\nNote: HMGA1a is rich with Ser and Thr residues, which provides multiple options for conducting peptide ligation. Therefore, STL strategy was employed to generate the full length HMGA1a (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nNote: The C-terminal Gly, Ala, Ser, Gln, Thr, Phe, and Cys(SStBu) salicylaldehyde esters generally give higher conversions under the standard STL ligation conditions (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] B), Therefore, we chose G37ˆT38 and G62ˆS63 as the disconnection sites for peptide ligation.\nNote: Before peptide fragment synthesis, we can use some peptide hydrophobicity /hydrophilicity analysis tools (e.g. https://www.peptide2.com/N_peptide_hydrophobicity_hydrophilicity.php[href=https://www.peptide2.com/N_peptide_hydrophobicity_hydrophilicity.php]) to evaluate the hydrophobicity, as very hydrophobic peptide sequence will aggregate during peptide elongation and results in the failure of peptide preparation. If so, it is better to choose another ligation site with less hydrophobic fragments. Alternatively, removable N-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzyl) (Hmb) tag can be used to improve synthesis of the hydrophobic peptides.\nProtection design.\nNote: HMGA1a synthesis involved three fragments via two ligations in the C-to-N direction; thus, the N-terminal Thr of the fragment 2 was temporarily protected by the Fmoc group. Otherwise, the N-terminus of fragment 2 may also react during ligation reaction.\nHMGA1a fragment 3 preparation\nTiming: [2 weeks]\nThis section describes the preparation of HMGA1a (63–106) peptide fragment along with the removable N-(2-hydroxy-4-methoxy benzyl) (Hmb) tag (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Peptide fragments can be readily produced by peptide synthesizer (e.g., CEM Liberty Blue). Alternatively, we can prepare them manually via solid phase peptide synthesis. Typically, one equivalent 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin reacts with four equivalents of the first amino acid and coupling reagent in DMF. HATU/DIEA were used as the coupling reagents.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/963-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The sequence of fragment 3",

And shake at 25°C for 2 h to generate the first amino acid anchored resin.\nDry the resin on a vacuum pump.\nWash by 10 mL DCM and 10 mL DMF for 3 times, respectively.\nThe obtained resin is swelled in 5 mL DCM containing 100 μL methanol and 56 μL DIEA (0.32 mmol).\nThe mixture is shaken for 30 min.\nThe resin is washed by DCM for 3 times and dry for next step.\nDeprotection: Add 5 mL 20% piperidine in DMF (v/v) to the reaction vessel.

Transfer the mixture into the reaction vessel. Shake for 2 h at 25°C.\nNote: Coupling time can be elongate to 12 h.",
    "Wash: Dry the resin and wash by 10 mL DMF × 3 times, 10 mL DCM × 3 times and 10 mL DMF × 3 times. Finally, the resin is dried for next step.\nDeprotection: Add 5 mL 20% piperidine in DMF (v/v) to the reaction vessel. Shake for 15 min at 25°C.\nWash: Dry the resin and wash by 10 mL DMF × 3 times, 10 mL DCM × 3 times and 10 mL DMF × 3 times. Finally, the resin is dried for next amino acid coupling (go to step c).\nNote: Repeated step c-f until all amino acids are coupled and then proceed to step g.\nCleavage from resin.\nAchieving side chain unprotected peptide: (Before the cleavage step, the peptide bound resin should wash by 10 mL DCM for 3 times) After completion of the synthesis, cleavage and global side chain deprotection can be achieved in the same manner by adding 10 mL cleavage cocktail A (TFA/H2O/phenol (90/5/5, v/v/v)) and shaking for 1h at 25°C. After cleavage, the resin is filtered, and combined filtrates are blown-off under a stream of compressed air. The crude product is precipitated by 40 mL cold diethyl ether, and followed by centrifugation immediately at 4000 g for 5 min. Then the ether is subsequently decanted. The obtained solid is ready for HPLC purification.",
    "Achieving sidechain full-protected peptide: (Before the cleavage step, the peptide bound resin should wash by 10 mL DCM for 3 times) Cleavage of peptide with sidechain protection can be achieved by adding 10 mL mild acidic cleavage cocktail B (CH2Cl2/2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE)/AcOH (8/1/1, v/v/v)) and shaking for 1 h at 25°C. After cleavage, the resin is filtered, and the combined filtrates are evaporated under Rotavap. The resulting oily crude product is further dissolved by 10 mL DCM and 30 mL hexane, followed by evaporation under vacuum to co-evaporate all acetic acid with hexane. The co-evaporation is repeated for 5 times to give a powder, which can be directly used for the preparation of the C-terminal peptide salicylaldehyde ester.\nCritical: The coupling from Glu92-Glu95 need to be monitored by the Kaiser test to make sure the coupling is finished as the continuous Glu residues cause strong steric hindrance and is difficult to couple. Also, decrease the loading of the resin to 0.3 mmol/g to reduce the steric hindrance during the coupling.\nNote: Coupling Fmoc-Ser(HPO3Bzl)-OH at Ser98, Ser101, and Ser102 using HATU/HOBt (4 equivalent) in DMF/NMP (1/1, v/v) as coupling reagent.\nCritical: Coupling Fmoc-Gly(Hmb)-OH at Gly96 for 12 h. Fmoc-Gly(Hmb)-OH is commercially available, or refer to the synthetic route at Wei et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].\nAfter coupling of the last Boc-Ser(tBu)-OH, treat resin with 10 mL 2% hydrazine in DMF (v/v) and shake for 30 min to liberate hydroxyl group on Hmb.",
    "Note: The hydroxyl group of Hmb will form an ester bond with the amino acids’ carboxyl group during each coupling, but it can be removed in the following deFmoc step by piperidine/DMF. In the last coupling, we do not perform the deprotection as we use Boc-Ser(tBu)-OH. Boc can be removed at cleavage step 8 without additional treatment. So, we need use hydrazine to remove the amino acids on Hmb. If the last amino acid is Fmoc protected, we need do the deFmoc step. Then, step 4 can be skipped.\nDry the resin by connecting the reaction vessel to vacuum pump and rinse by DCM.\nTreat resin with 10 mL Ac2O/Et3N/DMAP (100 μL/300 μL/5 mg) in DCM and shake for 30 min to cap the hydroxyl group of Hmb.\nNote: The Hmb will be cleaved by the following treatment of concentrated TFA if the hydroxyl group is unprotected.\nDry the resin by connecting the reaction vessel to vacuum pump and rinse by DCM.\nCleave the peptides from resin by treating resin with 10 mL TFA/H2O/Tips/Phenol (92.5/2.5/2.5/2.5, v/v/v/v) for 3 h.\nThe resin-cleavage solution mixture is filtered through the vessel filter frit by directly pushing the plunger into a 50 mL centrifugation tube, and the cleavage solution is concentrated under a stream of compressed air to give the crude product.\nCrude product is further precipitated by adding 40mL cold ether, followed by centrifugation immediately (4000 g, 5 min at 25°C).\nRepeat step 10 twice.\nThe solid is dissolved in 10 mL 10% CH3CN/H2O. The solution is filtered by 0.45 μm membrane filter to give a clear solution.",
    "Pipette 20 μL of the step 12 solution and dilute it to 200 μL by adding 180 μL 10% ACN/H2O. The sample is filtered by 0.45 μm membrane filter to give a clear filtrate which is place into a UPLC sample vial.\nThe step 13 sample vial is further place into a UPLC-MS sample chamber (maintaining at 15 oC) at corresponding position. Create a new injection method in the UPLC-MS Masslynx software, the detail parameters are as follow: MS File is 250-3072 8 min, MS Tune File is MS Tune 30 V, and the Inlet File are 15–60% 8 min (15–60% ACN/H2O), 10–50% 8 min (10–50% ACN/H2O), and 10–40% 8 min (10–40% ACN/H2O). The gradient which can give the best resolution for the sample is determined.\nAfter Step 14, the 10–40% 8 min (10–40% ACN/H2O) gives the best resolution of the sample in the UPLC-MS, each of sample component has shown a symmetric peak in the UPLC-MS UV spectrum.\nThe reverse phase column is connected to a Waters HPLC system.

This figure is reprinted with permission from Wei et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].\nNote: Spin down the resin and loading supernatant samples on SDS-PAGE.\nNote: Biotin-HMGA1a protein will appear at ∼16 kDa on SDS-PAGE as it contains many positive charged residues.\nNote: Mono-streptavidin protein can be released from resin after boiling and appear at ∼12 kDa on SDS-PAGE.\nNote: Pull-down of binders is one of applications of synthetic proteins. Besides, the synthetic proteins can be used in surface plasmon resonance (SPR) or isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to quantify the binding affinity."
