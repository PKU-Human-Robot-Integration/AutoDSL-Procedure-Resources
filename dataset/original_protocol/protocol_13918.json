    "Animal care and experimental procedures followed the specific institutional ethics guidelines and was approved by the state authority for animal research.\n1. Operation of the automated monitoring system\nNOTE: When operating the automated monitoring system, it is crucial to document every action in the comment box included in the software immediately prior to the action. The description should be typed into the comment box, and by pressing Save, it is saved with a specific timepoint. The timepoints are significant when analyzing the data, since the system records continuously, and the period of interest must be indicated for analysis.\nInstalling, using and maintaining the automated monitoring system\n\tNOTE: This protocol uses adult male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g (~10 weeks old). It is recommended to house rats in groups during the acclimatization period. The environmental conditions should be controlled with the following parameters: 12 h/12 h dark/light cycle with lights on at 6:00 A.M., humidity of 45%–65%, and temperature of 21–23 °C, and ad libitum access to water and standard rodent diet. Daily handling enables the animals to become accustomed to the investigators.\n\t\nSeparate the rats so that every animal has an individual cage. Ensure that every rat stays separated during the protocol.\nFill the housing cages with regular bedding with a 1–2 cm thick layer. This (reduced) amount decreases the possibility of contamination of microbalances and hoppers with spillage, thereby reducing measuring errors. Add plastic tubes (e.g., a 20 cm long piece of a plastic drainpipe with diameter of 8 cm) and gnawing wood as enrichment, while omitting paper tissues to reduce measuring errors.",
    "Prepare the cages for the automated solid and liquid food intake measurement by attaching two closed cage mounts with microbalances to custom-made holes in the front side of the cages. Place two empty hoppers on the cage mounts, one for the chow and one for the bottle.\n\t\tNOTE: The microbalances are connected via cables to a recording system attached to a computer and the respective software is installed on the computer.\nTo start recording, open “Monitor” and press “Start”, then choose a place to save the data.\nUsing the calibration (press “Calibrate”) function of the automated intake monitoring system, calibrate every balance by removing the hoppers and placing two different gauged weights on the cage mounts with balances. Do this at regular time intervals (weekly is recommended).\nFill one hopper completely with chow (~100 g) and remove chow pieces and crumbles that are too small in size. Fill water into the bottle (~100 mL) and place it into the other hopper.\nDocument the position of food and water (e.g., balance 1: food animal 1, balance 2: water animal 1).\nPlace the rat in the cage and open all gates of the cage mounts so that it can eat and drink ad libitum.\n\t\tNOTE: For an accurate measurement, it is necessary to maintain the balances and hoppers daily by cleaning gently with a brush from spillage and removing small food crumbs from the food container. This will greatly reduce erroneous measurement. Close all gates during the daily maintenance.\nAccessing data after the experiments\n\t\nSearch in the comment box for the beginning and end timepoints of a period (e.g., training, test) that needs to be analyzed.\nClick on “View data” on the software to open the Data Viewer.",
    "Insert the timepoints in the boxes below “Begin time” and “End time”. Press the square in the left upper corner indicating the balance that recorded the information.\nClick on “PSC Totals” to access the microstructure data. Press the button “Export PSC Table” to export the data.\n\t\tNOTE: To compare the microstructure of individual animals (e.g., unstressed vs. stressed) using automated monitoring, individual animals can be selected in the “Data viewer” by pressing the appropriate square in the left upper corner. The PSC Totals shows only the microstructure for the selected animal. Statistical analysis cannot be performed with the system. The data needs to be extracted into a spreadsheet program/analyzing software.\n2. Implementation of the sucrose preference test\nConducting the training period\n\tNOTE: Prior to the test, animals must be accustomed to the availability of two bottles for liquids on hoppers through the gates, while food should be provided from the tops of cages (set-up is shown in Figure 1). This training period should last for at least 2 days. It is performed in the home cages in the room where animals are held.\n\t\nClose all the gates. Remove the water bottle and food container from the microbalances.\nPlace pre-weighed food (~50 g) on the top of the cage and document its weight daily using a regular balance to assess daily food consumption. Refill, if necessary.\nClean a bottle with clear water and refill with around 100 mL of water. Place it back on the hopper.\nFill a second clean bottle with 100 mL of freshly made 1% sucrose solution. Place it on the hopper.\n\t\tNOTE: Mark the bottles carefully and document their locations (e.g., balance 1: water animal 1, balance 2: sucrose solution animal 1).",
    "Open all gates. Document the start of training in the monitoring system. Leave the gates open for 24 h, resulting in ad libitum access to both bottles. After 24 h, close the gates and document the end of the training. Data from the 24 h interval can be assessed using the automated monitoring system by inserting the “begin time” and “end time”. The procedures are the same when a 1 h test interval is assessed.\nClean and refill the bottles every 24 h. Prepare fresh 1% sucrose solution daily. Switch the position of the water and sucrose solution bottle daily to avoid habituation effects.\n\t\tNOTE: Conduct the training in all animals at least 48 h until the preference ratios reache ~1. The sucrose preference ratio is assessed directly after training using the “Data viewer”. It is calculated as the ratio of sucrose intake to overall intake (water plus sucrose intake).\n24 h before the test, remove the bottle with the sucrose solution so the rat has access to standard chow and water only.\nPrepare one fresh bottle filled with tap water and one filled with a 1% sucrose solution, both with ~100 mL.\nPrior to testing, close all gates.\nRemove the bottle filled with tap water from the hopper and place the two fresh bottles, one filled with tap water and one filled with a 1% sucrose solution, on the hopper.\nOpen all gates, document the start of the test in the monitoring system. Leave the gates open for 60 min. Close the gates after 60 min and document the end of the test.\nAssess the data (e.g., the sucrose/total fluid intake ratio).\n\t\tNOTE: The test can be repeated several times with intervals of training (at least 2 days) in between.\n3. Implementation of the novelty-induced hypophagia test",
    "Conducting the training period\n\tNOTE: Prior to testing, a daily 30 min training period of 5 days is recommended (set-up is shown in Figure 2). The aim is to achieve a stable baseline of palatable snack intake before the experiment. It is performed in the home cages in the room where animals are held.\n\t\nClose all gates and remove the hopper with standard chow.\nFill a fresh hopper with the palatable snack (~50 g). Insert the crackers carefully into the hopper to prevent crumbling. Place the hopper on the cage mount on top of the microbalance.\nOpen the gates for 30 min so that the rat has ad libitum access to the snack and water. Document the beginning of training in the monitoring system.\n\t\tNOTE: The rat should have no access to standard chow during the training period.\nClose the gates after 30 min and document the end of training in the monitoring system. Replace the snack with standard chow.\nRepeat this daily until a 1) stable baseline palatable snack intake is achieved (e.g., 1.5–2.0 g/30 min) and 2) intake does not statistically differ between training days.\nPerforming the novelty-induced hypophagia test\n\t\nPrepare an empty, freshly cleaned cage without bedding or enrichment attached to the automated food intake monitoring system. Place a hopper with a bottle of tap water and hopper with a palatable snack on the cage mounts.\n\t\tNOTE: The novel cage should placed in the same room where the rats are held and training conducted. Keep the gates closed.\nRemove the rat from the home cage and place in the novel cage.\nOpen all gates for 30 min. Document the beginning of testing in the monitoring system.",
    "NOTE: During the 30 min of access to the snack, the size of snack intake and underlying microstructure parameters (e.g., latency to first meal) are recorded using the automated food intake monitoring system.\nClose the gates after 30 min and document the end of testing. Place the rat back into the home cage.\n\t\tNOTE: The test can be repeated several times with intervals of training (at least 5 days) in between.\nSubscription Required.
