    "Preoperative settingsDesign the study and experiments in accordance with the National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, 2011).Weigh animals to verify that all weights are within the 200-300 g range and use the individual weights to determine the dose of antibiotic and the amount of fluid resuscitation to be used, as well as the doses of ketamine and xylazine in case anesthesia is necessary.Clean and disinfect the operating table with disinfectant wipes or alcohol.AnesthesiaAnesthetize the animals with isoflurane (0.25-2.5%/kg BW gas inhalation) or with ketamine (80-100 mg/kg BW i.p.) with xylazine (5-15 mg per kg body weight i.p.) for general tests, such as cardiovascular, pulmonary or renal studies.Note: Commonly, rats weighing around 300 g present more tolerance to anesthetics, therefore we suggest increasing the dose according to the ranges mentioned above. Verify the effect of the anesthesia by pinching the tail and a toe. Typically, the extremities will be unresponsive within 1-2 min after administration of the anesthetic agent(s). In our experience, isoflurane can be used for all procedures.Shave the lower abdominal region using liquid soap and razor blades. Disinfect the region with gauze, alcohol, and povidone-iodine (Figure 1A).Place rats in the supine position on a flat surface (Figures 1A-1I).Note: In case of training or some reasons where the surgery take much time, we recommend using surgical eye drops to protect rat eyes. Cecal ligation and punctureMake a longitudinal incision (3-4 cm long) in the disinfected region with scissors and tweezers (Figure 1B).Dissect the muscle fascia from the abdominal musculature and carefully make a 3- to 4-cm incision (Figure 1B).Find the cecum, using anatomical tweezers to expose it (i.e., bring it out of the abdominal cavity). In many cases, the cecum is located on the left side of the abdomen (Figure 1C).",
    "Note: Expose only the cecum and leave the bowels inside peritoneal cavity, taking care to do not damage the mesenteric blood vessels (Figure 1C). Sham group: After completing the Step C3, return the cecum to the abdominal cavity, then close the abdominal musculature and skin as indicated in the Steps C8 and C9. Use thin tweezers to cross the cecal mesentery with nonabsorbable silk suture 3.0 to ligate the cecum (1.5-cm from the cecal tip or 50% of the cecum; Figure 1D).Note: Keep the cecal contents near the cecal tip and keep the intestinal passage (through the ileocecal valve) free (Figure 1E). Puncture the distal cecum twice with a 16 G needle. The perforations should traverse the cecum (Figure 1F).Squeeze the punctured distal cecum in order to extract a small amount of feces (approximately 2 drops) and distribute it around the cecum and peritoneal cavity (Figure 1G).Note: Extract the same amount of feces and distribute it in the same regions in all animals. Use tweezers to distribute it.Return the cecum to the abdominal cavity carefully (i.e., without extracting more feces on the abdomen).Close the abdominal musculature by simple suturing. Before completing the closure, administer fluid resuscitation with pre-warmed saline solution 0.9% or 0.15 M NaCl at 37 °C (25 ml/kg BW i.p.), as illustrated in Figure 1H.Close the abdominal skin with simple sutures (Figure 1I).Note: Ideally all these steps should be performed within 10 min, controlled from the first surgical step (Video 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3979/bioprotoc-11-07-3979-g001.jpgFigure 1.

Cecal Ligation and Puncture Model in Rats. This video was made at University of São Paulo (USP) according to guidelines from the “USP” on Animal Care and approved by the Research Ethics Committee at University of São Paulo School of Medicine under protocol # 378 603.Postoperative careAfter abdominal closure, inject tramadol hydrochloride 50 mg/ml (dose: 5 mg/kg i.m., every 8 h) for postoperative analgesia and continue as necessary.Return rats immediately to pre-warmed cages with a baby bed warmer (25 °C) below each cage. Note: Food and water should be made available. At 6 h after the procedure (sham or CLP), under anesthesia with isoflurane, administer imipenem-cilastatin (14 mg/kg BW in saline solution s.c.). Then inject saline solution 0.9% at 25 °C (25 ml/kg BW in saline solution s.c.).Note: Subcutaneous administration (s.c.) for saline solution should be distributed in different abdominal regions, we suggest at the least 5 places. Be careful and avoid administering high volume of solution in a specific zone Return rats immediately to cages in a temperature-controlled environment (20 °C), on a 12/12-h light/dark cycle, with ad libitum access to food and water. The animals should be monitored every 6 h, and outcomes should be evaluated at 24 h or 48 h."
