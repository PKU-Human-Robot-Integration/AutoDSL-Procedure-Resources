    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe protocol herein highlights the three major steps for assessing the functionality of the cGAS-STING pathway in mammalian cells, through evaluation of the downstream signaling pathway.\nPreparation of dsDNA and purity check\nTiming: 4 h\nThis section describes the steps involved in the preparation of dsDNA probes from ssDNA and the method of verifying the integrity of the annealed probes.\nPrepare annealing reaction in PCR tubes as per below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1647_7.csv\nNote: a 100 μL reaction should provide sufficient annealed probes to stimulate approximately 10 wells of a 6-well plate.\nInsert the tubes in the PCR machine and use the following program for annealing:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1647_8.csv\ndsDNA probes purity check: Prepare a 10% Acrylamide gel using an acrylamide gel casting system (e.g., Biorad gel casting system):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1647_9.csv\nAfter the annealing step, measure the concentration of the dsDNA preparation sample by UV spectrophotometry (e.g., Nanodrop).\nNote: you should obtain a concentration close to 0.25 μg/μL.\nLoad in the 10% Acrylamide gel, 0.5 μg of each sample with 6× loading dye (e.g., orange/blue DNA gel loading dye) along with a 5 bp or 100 bp ladder. Load same amount of ssDNA as a control.\nRun the gel in 1× TBE at 120 V for around 40 min.\nStain the gel with diluted Ethidium Bromide (1 μg/mL) or 1× SYBR™ safe solution in 1× TBE for 10 min under the chemical hood.\nTo verify the annealing and integrity of the dsDNA probes, trans-illumination with UV light can be used (gel imaging system UV light based e.g., Biovision) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1647-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Outcome of dsDNA preparation and transfection in MEFs\n(A) DNA samples (dsDNA and ssDNA) migrated in a 10% acrylamide gel were visualized using UV light after SYBR safe staining.",
    "(B) Whole cell extracts prepared from MEFs following 6 h stimulation with dsDNA were analyzed by WB using indicated antibodies.\n(C) mRNA levels of Ifnβ, Oas1, Cxcl10 and Isg15 mRNA levels in MEF, following dsDNA stimulation for 6 h (n = 3 biological replicates). All graphs present means ± SEM. p values were determined by paired Student’s t test. ∗ p ≤0.05; ∗∗p ≤0.01; ∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.001.\nMEFs seeding and dsDNA transfection\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis section describes the method of plating the cells followed by transfection using the already prepared dsDNA.\nDay 1: 1 h.\nSeed 6-well plates with 2 mL of complete media at a concentration of 125,000 cells per mL. Note that the number of cells seeded, and the growth medium depends on the cell line (Here, we used MEFs in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS; 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 1% Glutamine). According to the manufacturer’s recommendation (https://www.polyplus-transfection.com/products/jetprime/[href=https://www.polyplus-transfection.com/products/jetprime/]), cells have to reach 60%–80% confluency for dsDNA transfection with JetPRIME reagent.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24 h before transfection.\nDay 2: 30 min.\nReplace media with 1 mL fresh complete media.\nTransfection is performed using the JetPRIME reagent, according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.polyplus-transfection.com/products/jetprime/[href=https://www.polyplus-transfection.com/products/jetprime/]). For activation of the cGAS-STING pathway, 2 μg of dsDNA per well is sufficient. Calculate the volume containing 2 μg of dsDNA from your dsDNA probes sample. As a negative control, mock transfection is performed, using a volume of 1× annealing buffer corresponding to that used in dsDNA transfection. Prepare the dsDNA transfection and control mixtures (volumes for one well is shown). Multiply the volume of each material by the number of wells required and prepare the mixture accordingly.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1647_10.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1647_11.csv",
    "Add 4 μL of jetPRIME® reagent per point in each mixture, vortex for 1 s, and incubate for 10 min at RT (20°C–25°C).\nAdd 200 μL of mixture into each well dropwise containing 1 mL of complete medium.\nGently swirl the plate to ensure even distribution of the mixture.\nIncubate the plates at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 6 h.\nAfter 6 h, aspirate the media and wash each well twice with 500 μL cold 1× PBS.\nAspirate PBS and dry the wells. You can then proceed with protein analysis (western blot) or gene expressing analysis (RT-qPCR).\nWestern blot\nTiming: 7 h\nThis section describes a detailed stepwise method on how to perform a western blot. It also describes the process of stripping the membrane and reprobing for different proteins.\nDay 1: 2 h.\nLyse cells with lysis buffer:\nAdd 30 μL of lysis buffer (completed with β-Mercaptoethanol and PMSF) per well (plate on ice) and scrape the cells with buffer.\nCollect each point in Eppendorf tubes and incubate on ice at 4°C for 30 min.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 12,000 rcf for 30 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the pellet and collect the supernatant i.e., the whole-cell lysate.\nMeasure protein concentration of lysates using Bradford method (other methods like bicinchoninic acid assay can also be used).\nAdd 1 μL of cell lysate to a cuvette containing 1 mL of 1× Bio-Rad Protein Assay dye.\nFor the blank measurement, add 1 μL of Lysis buffer to 1 mL of 1× Bio-Rad Protein Assay dye.\nMeasure the optical density (OD) at 595 nm of the samples with a photometer.\nMeasure the optical density (OD) at 595 nm of the standard curve samples (BSA at 2, 1.5, 1, 0.75, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125 μg/μL) as recommended by the manufacturer (https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/4110065A.pdf[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/webroot/web/pdf/lsr/literature/4110065A.pdf]).",
    "Create a standard curve by plotting OD values (y-axis) versus their concentration in μg/μL (x-axis). Determine the unknown sample concentration using the standard curve.\nPause point: At this step, you can either proceed to sample preparation or store the samples at −20°C for up to a month or at −80°C for up to a year.\nSample preparation for gel loading:\nCalculate the volume of lysate containing 20 μg of protein.\nAdd this volume of lysate into 3.75 μL 4× Laemmli buffer.\nIncrease the total volume to e.g., 15 μL by adding dH2O.\nHeat the mixtures at 95°C for 5 min.\nSpin down the tubes for 2–3 s using a microcentrifuge (376 rcf).\nPause point: At this step, you can either proceed to load the gel or store the samples at −20°C for up to a month or at −80°C for up to a year.\nLoad the lysate samples and run a 10% SDS-PAGE gel.\nSet up a mini gel tank and fill it with 1× running buffer prepared from 10× running buffer.\nPosition the gel inside the tank and load the sample in each well.\nRun the gel at 200 V until the blue dye front is out.\nPerform dry transfer of proteins from the gel to nitrocellulose membrane using Trans-Blot Turbo transfer system (other transfer methods such as wet or semi-dry transfer can also be performed).\nPlace the membrane with filter papers at the bottom, inside the cassette and position the gel above the membrane.\nPlace filter papers on top of the gel and use the roller to remove trapped air bubbles from the ‘transfer sandwich’.\nInsert the cassette into the blotting apparatus and transfer for 10 min at a constant current of 1.3A (using the ‘mixed molecular weights’ program).",
    "After transfer, submerge the nitrocellulose membrane in Ponceau S stain for 1 min.\nRinse the membranes with demineralized water to destain the background and visualize protein bands.\nWash the membrane with PBST until it has completely destained (5–10 min).\nBlock the membrane in PBST containing 5% milk for 30 min at RT (20°C–25°C).\nWash the membrane 3 times with PBST (10 min each).\nIncubate the membrane with primary antibody solution at appropriate dilution (e.g., Here, 1:1,000 and 1:500 dilutions of antibodies was used, in PBST supplemented with 5% BSA and overnight (12–16 h) incubation at 4°C).\nDay 2: 5 h.\nRemove the primary antibody; wash the membrane 3 times (10 min each) using PBST.\nIncubate the membrane in secondary antibody solution (1:1,000 in PBST supplemented with 5% milk) at RT (20°C–25°C) for 1 h.\nWash the membrane 3 times (10 min each) using PBST.\nDetect the protein bands by chemiluminescent visualization (e.g., Bio-Rad ChemiDoc imaging system).\nPrepare a solution by mixing equal volumes of SuperSignal™ West Pico PLUS.     Luminol/Enhancer and SuperSignal™ West Pico PLUS Stable Peroxide.\nPut the solution on top of the membrane and incubate for 5 min at RT (20°C–25°C).\nIf the signal strength is too low, wash the membrane in PBST for 5 min and use SuperSignal™ West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate as in step a-b above to increase the signal strength (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nTo probe for remaining protein bands, the membrane must be stripped and re-blocked.\nSubmerge the membrane in Restore™ PLUS Stripping Buffer and incubate at RT (20°C–25°C) for 5–15 min on a rocker. The reagent can be reused up to 5 times.\nWash the membrane with PBST 3 times for 10 min each.\nBlock membrane with PBST-5% milk and probe for other bands as mentioned previously.\nReal time-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)",
    "Timing: 8 h\nThis section describes a detailed stepwise method on how to perform an RT-qPCR.\nPrinciples of the procedure: It is a well-established technique used for the quantification of RNA in biological samples that involves amplification of target genes. For more information about key points and parameters of RT-qPCR, refer to Kralik et al. (Nolan et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). This method comprises three major steps:\nRNA extraction and preparation\nTiming: 2 h\nDirectly add TRIzolTM (acid-guanidinium-phenol based reagent designed for the extraction of RNA) on cells in every well (500 μL for a well in 6 well plate).\nPut the plates on a plate rocker for 5 min at RT (20°C–25°C) (under a hood).\nResuspend up and down the lysed cells and collect them into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes.\nPause point: At this step, you can either proceed or store at −20°C for the following days or store at −80°C for up to a year.\nCritical: TRIzolTM is a harmful agent that is toxic if it contacts with skin (causing skin burns) and if swallowed. According to the safety sheet, it is suspected of causing damage to organs through repeated exposure so it is always recommended to use it only under a chemical hood. TRIzolTM RNA extraction can be replaced by RNA extraction column-based protocols not involving TRIzol and chloroform (e.g; GenElute™ Total RNA Purification Kit/Sigma or RNeasy Kits/Qiagen).\nAdd 100 μL of chloroform per 500 μL of TRIzolTM reagent used for lysis in each RT-qPCR sample, then securely cap the tube.\nShake by inverting the tubes several times for 1 min.\nIncubate for 2 min at RT (20°C–25°C).\nCentrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 rcf at 4°C.",
    "Note: The mixture separates into a lower red phenol-chloroform organic phase containing protein, DNA etc., an interphase (white layer), and a colorless upper aqueous phase containing RNA.\nCollect 200 μL of the aqueous transparent phase containing RNA and transfer to a new Eppendorf tube.\nOptional: Tilt the tube at 45° to collect the upper phase easily.\nNote: Be careful to not touch the interface layer, if not, this generates DNA and proteins contamination.\nAdd 250 μL of isopropanol to the tube only containing aqueous phase to precipitate RNA.\nShake and incubate at RT (20°C–25°C) for 10 min.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 12,000 rcf at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant carefully.\nNote: Total RNA precipitate forms a white gel-like pellet at the bottom of the tube.\nResuspend each RNA pellet in 500 μL of 70% ethanol (prepared with PCR grade water).\nNote: The RNA can be stored in 70% ethanol for at least 1 year at −20°C, or at least 1 week at 4°C.\nVortex the sample briefly.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 7,500 rcf at 4°C.\nNote: Heat nuclease free water to 65°C.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nCentrifuge for 30 s at 7,500 rcf to remove any excess of ethanol.\nLet the RNA pellet dry for 5–10 min under the hood (for ethanol evaporation).\nResuspend the pellet in 10 μL of nuclease free water (preferentially warmed up 65°C, as recommended above).\nIncubate the samples for 10 min at RT (20°C–25°C).\nQuantify the RNA using UV spectrophotometry (e.g., Nanodrop).",
    "Note: The measurements will be in ng/μL with two ratios to take into consideration: A260/A280 which is a ratio for phenol contamination, and A230/A280 which is a ratio for protein contamination. If the ratios are close to 2; this means that the purity of RNA is high. Otherwise, this could affect RT-qPCR results (e.g., later Cycle Threshold (Ct)).\nPause point: At this step, you can either proceed or store at −20°C for the following days or store at −80°C for up to one year.\nDNAse treatment and cDNA synthesis\nTiming: 3 h\nPerform DNAse treatment with 2 μg per sample. Add water to reach a final volume of 8.5 μL per sample.\nPrepare a ‘DNAse mix’ for all your samples with 1 μL 10× TURBO DNAse Buffer and 0.5 μL of DNAse enzyme per sample.\nAdd the 1.5 μL of ‘DNAse mix’ into the sample.\nIncubate at 37°C for 20 min.\nResuspend DNAse inactivation reagent and add 2 μL into each reaction.\nVortex and incubate for 5 min at RT (20°C–25°C) (mix occasionally by rotating the tubes).\nCentrifuge at 10,000 rcf for 3 min at RT (20°C–25°C).\nTransfer 9 μL of each reaction into a PCR tube.\nPause point: You can either proceed with cDNA synthesis or store samples at −20°C for next day use. For longer storage, keep the reaction at −80°C.\nPerform cDNA synthesis using SuperScript IV system. Add Mix 1 of cDNA synthesis (listed the reagents below) to the RNA samples (9 μL RNA + 4.5 μL of Mix 1 per reaction).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1647_12.csv\nStart the PCR program as follows:\nAdd tubes in the PCR machine for the annealing step.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1647_13.csv\nWhen there is the “hold 1” at 4°C, add the mix 2 (6.5 μL per reaction, total will be 20 μL).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1647_14.csv",
    "Vortex, spin down the PCR tubes and resume the PCR program.\nPause point: You choose either to proceed with preparing the plate or to store the synthesized cDNA at −20°C if you continue to use it the day after. Otherwise, for longer storage, keep it at −80°C.\nGene expression analysis (qPCR)\nTiming: 3 h\nPrepare cDNA dilutions for qPCR: Adjust cDNA samples to 20 ng/μL using nuclease-free water (so that 2.5 μL provides 50 ng cDNA per reaction).\nChoose the below tested genes for cGAS-STING pathway activation (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) and add housekeeping genes (e.g., HSP90, HPRT). Prepare the primer master mix for each gene.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1647_15.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1647_16.csv\nLoad 2.5 μL of diluted cDNA.\nLoad 7.5 μL of primer master mix into diluted cDNA.\nSeal the plates with optical heat seals and spin down quickly for 3–5 s.\nNote: This can be done in 96 or 384-well reaction plates.\nStart the PCR program as per below:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1647_17.csv\nUsing Ct values for the housekeeping gene and genes of interest, calculate the delta CT: ΔCt = Ct (gene of interest e.g., Cxcl10) – Ct (housekeeping e.g., Hsp90). Calculate 2-ΔCt for each sample and normalize your value to “Control/non transfected” sample to obtain fold induction for dsDNA sample (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C)."
