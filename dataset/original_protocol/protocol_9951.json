    "This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Brigham and Women's Hospital.\n1. GelMA synthesis\nDissolve 10 g of gelatin in 100 mL of Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) using a magnetic stirrer at 50 °C.\nAdd 8 mL of methacrylic anhydride slowly while stirring the gelatin prepolymer solution at 50 °C for 2 h. Dilute the reacted gelatin solution with preheated DPBS at 50 °C.\nTransfer the diluted solution into dialysis membranes (molecular weight cutoff = 12–14 kDa) and place them into deionized (DI) water. Perform dialysis at 40 °C for about 1 week.\nFilter the dialyzed GelMA prepolymer solution using a sterile filter (pore size = 0.22 µm) and transfer 25 or 30 mL of the solution into 50 mL tubes and store at -80 °C for 2 days.\nFreeze-dry the frozen GelMA prepolymer solution using a freeze dryer for 5 days.\n2. Preparation of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) prepolymer solution\nDissolve 200 mg (20% of total solution) of PEGDA (MW = 1,000) with 5 mg (0.5% of total solution) of 2-hydroxy-4-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone (photo-initiator, PI) in 1 mL of DPBS.\nIncubate the prepolymer solution at 80 °C for 5 min.\n3. Preparation of GelMA-coated CNT dispersed stock solution\nDissolve 80 mg of GelMA (used as a biosurfactant) in 4 mL of DPBS and then add 20 mg of COOH functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into the GelMA prepolymer solution.\nSonicate the MWCNT-laden GelMA prepolymer solution for 1 h (0.66Hz, 100 Watt).",
    "NOTE: During the sonication process, the solution must be immersed in a water bath at ~15 °C to prevent evaporation of solvent due to the rise in temperature.\n4. Preparation of 1 mg/mL CNT containing 5% GelMA prepolymer solution\nDissolve 50 mg of GelMA and 5 mg (0.5% of total solution) of PI in 0.8 mL of DPBS at 80 °C for 10 min.\nAdd 0.2 mL of the prepared CNT stock solution (step 3). Vortex and incubate the solution at 80 °C for 10 min.\n5. Preparation of a 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyl methacrylate (TMSPMA) coated glass slide\nWash the glass slides (thickness = 1 mm, size = 5.08 cm x 7.62 cm) with pure ethanol.\nStack the cleaned slides vertically in a 250 mL beaker and spread 3 mL of TMSPMA on top of them using a syringe. Cover the beaker with aluminum foil to prevent evaporation of TMSPMA.\nIncubate the slides in an 80 ˚C oven for 1 day.\nWash the coated glass slides by dipping them into pure ethanol, then dry.\nStore the coated glass slides wrapped in aluminum foil at room temperature (RT).\n\tNOTE: Try to minimize touching the surfaces of the TMSPMA-coated glass slides.\n6. Fabrication of the flexible Au microelectrodes\nDesign a shadow mask using computer-aided design (Supplementary File 3).\nFabricate and purchase a shadow mask.\nWash the glass slide (thickness = 1 mm, size = 3 cm x 4 cm) with acetone and dry with a compressed air gun.\nAttach the shadow mask to the glass substrates using double sided tape, then put them in an E-beam evaporator and wait until the chamber pressure reaches at least 10-6 Torr.",
    "NOTE: The two pieces of tape were placed manually on the support at a distance short enough to host the glass and large enough to fit the entire pattern. This step takes around 45–60 min.\nDeposit a 200 nm thick Au layer by E-beam evaporator (e.g., with Denton EE-4, vacuum = 10-6 Torr, power = 2.6%, rate = 2 Å/s) and cut the fabricated microelectrodes using a dicing saw machine (electrodes size = 7.38 mm x 8.9 mm x 200 nm).\n7. Fabrication of an Au microelectrode-integrated micropatterned multilayered hydrogel scaffold\nNOTE: The result of this procedure is a membrane where a micropatterned PEGDA hydrogel is in the bottom layer, a micropatterned CNT-GelMA hydrogel is on top, and the Au microelectrodes are between the two layers. This configuration ensures a better flexibility to the electrode and limits the risk of breaking.\nDesign and fabricate two photomasks to create the micropatterned PEGDA (1st photomask) and the CNT-GelMA hydrogel (2nd photomask) layers. See Supplementary File 2–3. The design can be done by using CAD software.\n\tNOTE: See Figure 2B, E.\nPlace 50 μm spacers made by stacking one layer of commercial invisible tape (Thickness: 50 μm) on a TMSPMA coated glass. Pour 15 μL of 20% PEGDA prepolymer solution on top of the TMSPMA coated glass, then cover with gold microelectrode. Place the 1st photomask for the glass slide (micropatterned PEGDA) on top of the gold microelectrode and expose the whole construct to UV light (200 W mercury vapor short arc lamp with 320–390 nm filter) at 800 mW of intensity and 8 cm distance for 110 s.\n\tNOTE: See Figure 1A.",
    "Add DPBS to surround the glass slide and detach the micropatterned PEGDA hydrogel together with the Au microelectrodes from the uncoated glass substrate carefully after 5–10 min to obtain the glass slide that has the micropatterned PEGDA hydrogel with the Au microelectrodes.\n\tNOTE: See Figure 1B. Due to the TMSPMA coating, the construct is transferred from the uncoated glass substrate to the TMSPMA-coated one. Detach carefully because the Au microelectrodes can break easily during this step (Figure 3).\nPlace 100 μm spacers made by stacking two layers of commercial transparent tape (thickness = 50 µm) on the bottom of a Petri dish. Deposit a drop of 20 μL CNT-GelMA prepolymer solution between the spacers and then flip the glass slide obtained in 7.3 and fix it onto the dish with adhesive tape.\nRotate the device upside down and place the 2nd photomask on top of the glass slide. Expose under UV light at 800 mW of intensity and 8 cm distance for 200 s.\n\tNOTE: See Figure 1C. Alignment of the 2nd mask is important.\nWash the obtained scaffold with DPBS and with cell culture medium that includes 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nLeave them overnight in the 37 °C incubator before seeding the cells.\n8. Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes isolation and culture\nIsolate hearts from 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats following protocols approved by the Institute's Committee on Animal Care8.\nPut the heart pieces on the shaker overnight (around 16 h) in 0.05% trypsin without EDTA in HBSS in a cold room.\nCollect the heart pieces with a pipette gun and minimize the amount of trypsin, then put them in a 50 mL tube with 10 mL of warm cardiac media (10% FBS, 1% P/S, 1% L-glutamine).",
    "Swirl slowly (~60 rpm) in a 37 °C water bath for 7 min. Remove the media carefully from the tube with a 10 mL pipette and leave the heart pieces in the tube.\nAdd 7 mL of 0.1% collagenase type 2 in HBSS and swirl in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min.\nMix with a 10 mL pipette 10x gently to disrupt the heart pieces. Remove the media from the tube with a 1 mL pipette.\nAdd 10 mL of 0.1% collagenase type 2 in HBSS and swirl quickly (~120–180 rpm) in a 37 °C water bath for 10 min, then check if the heart pieces are dissolving.\nMix with a 10 mL pipette, then repeat with a 1 mL pipette to break the last heart pieces.\nOnce the solution looks homogeneous, place a 70 µm cell strainer on a new 50 mL tube and pipette the solution 1 mL at a time on strainer.\nCentrifuge the heart cell solution at 180 x g for 5 min at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: If there are still some heart pieces or mucus which did not dissolve, repeat steps 8.7–8.9 again.\nCarefully remove all the liquid above the cell pellet and resuspended the cells in 2 mL of cardiac media.\nAdd 2 mL of cardiac media from the tube wall carefully to resuspend the cells and avoid breaking them.\nAdd the suspended cells into a T175 flask with warm cardiac media drop by drop. Put the flask in a 37 °C incubator for 1 h to allow cardiac fibroblasts to attach to the bottom.\n\tNOTE: At this preplating step, the cardiac fibroblasts will attach to the flask while the cardiomyocytes will remain in the suspension medium.",
    "Collect the media from the flask that contains the cardiomyocytes and put it into a 50 mL tube.\nCount the cells, then centrifuge at 260 x g for 5 min at 37 °C.\nResuspend and seed the cells on top of the fabricated soft robot in step 7. Pour specific volume of cardiac media with the cardiomyocytes at a concentration of 1.95 × 106 cell/mL drop by drop onto the entire surface of the device.\nIncubate the samples at 37 °C and change the media with 5 mL cell culture media with 2% FBS and 1% L-glutamine on the first and the second days after seeding. Change the media every time the color of the media shifts.\n9. Cell staining for alignment analysis\nRemove the media and wash with DPBS for 5 min at RT.\nFix the cells using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 20 min at RT. Then wash with DPBS for 5 min at RT.\nIncubate the cells with 0.1% triton in DPBS at RT for 1 h. Wash 3x with PBS for 5 min at RT.\nIncubate the cells with 10% goat serum in DPBS at RT for 1 h.\nIncubate the cells with a primary antibody (sarcomeric α-actinin and connexin-43) in 10% goat serum in DPBS at 4 °C for ~14–16 h.\nWash 3x with DPBS for 5 min at RT. Incubate the cells with the secondary antibody in 10% goat serum in DPBS at RT for 1 h.\nWash 3x with DPBS for 5 min at RT, then counterstain cells with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in DI water (1:1,000) for 10 min at RT. Wash 3x with DPBS for 5 min at RT.\nTake fluorescence images using an inverted laser scanning confocal microscope.\n10. Actuator testing and behavior evaluation\nSpontaneous beating of the cardiomyocytes on the soft robot",
    "Incubate bioinspired actuators at 37 °C for 5 days and refresh the media on day 1 and 2 and when necessary (i.e., when the media turns yellow). Use an inverted optical microscope to take images daily (5x and/or 10x). Record cell movements using video capture software on the microscope's live window for 30 s at 20 frames per second (5x and/or 10x) when the contractile activity starts (generally around day 3).\nAt day 5, detach the membranes by gently lifting from the edge with a cover slide.\n\t\tNOTE: If the cells show a strong beating behavior, the membranes will detach by themselves due to the mechanical action of the contractions.\nBulk electrical signal stimulation\n\t\nUsing a 3 cm spaced PDMS as a holder, affix two carbon rod electrodes with platinum (Pt) wire in a 6 cm Petri dish filled with cardiac media. Then carefully transfer the soft robot into the Petri dish.\nApply a square waveform with 50 ms pulse width, DC offset value 0 V, and peak voltage amplitude between 0.5 and 6 V. The frequency varies between 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Hz with a duty cycle between 2.5%, 5%, and 10%, respectively. Record macroscale contractions using a commercially available camera.\nElectrical stimulation with the Au microelectrodes\n\t\nAfter fabrication of Au microelectrode-integrated multilayered hydrogel scaffold, attach two copper wires to the Au electrodes though an external square port using silver paste.\nCover the silver paste with a thin layer of PDMS precured at 80 °C for 5 min. Then put the samples on a hot plate at 45 °C for 5 h to fully crosslink the PDMS.",
    "After seeding cardiomyocyte, apply a square wave electrical stimulus on the copper wires with DC offset value 1 V, peak voltage amplitude between 1.5 and 5 V, and frequencies of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 Hz respectively.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
