    "All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY (1395M, Biosafety 180501 and 180502).\nNOTE: Perform Steps 1-3 on the same day.\n1. Dissection of mouse bladder\nPreparation for dissection\n\t\nPrepare all the sterile instruments including scissors, forceps, sterile DPBS in 35 mm culture dishes, 70% ethanol, sterile gauze, and clean paper towels. Clean all surfaces of the dissection area. Generate male triple floxed mice Trp53f/f: Ptenf/f: Rb1f/f (4 mice, 10 weeks old), as previously described in Dr. Goodrich's lab 8.\nEuthanasia and incision\n\t\nEuthanize the mice by CO2 asphyxiation using a 2.0 L/min flow rate, followed by cervical dislocation. Clean the dissection area with 70% ethanol and cover with a clean paper towel.\nPlace the mouse on gauze in the dissection area. Spray 70% ethanol on the mouse abdomen and use sterile dissection scissors to make a lower midline abdominal incision exposing the bladder.\nDissecting the bladder\n\t\nUse forceps to grasp the bladder and gently pull up so that bilateral ureterovesical junctions are identified. Use scissors to remove the bladder fundus following the boundary line between the two ureter openings.\nTransfer the bladder into a sterile dish with 2 mL of DPBS. Remove fatty and connective tissue and put the bladder into a new dish with sterile 2 mL of DPBS. At this time, take the adenovirus out from -80 °C storage and keep it on ice.\n2. Dissociation of urothelial cells\nPreparation for cell dissociation",
    "Prepare all sterile instruments, including forceps, surgical scalpels (a size 10 blade with handle), sterile DPBS in 35 mm culture dishes, complete culture medium without charcoal-stripped FBS defined as CCM(-), collagenase/hyaluronidase mixture, recombinant enzyme for trypsin substitute, 10% charcoal-stripped FBS in DPBS with 10 µM fresh Y-27632, a 100 µm sterile cell strainer, and a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The complete culture medium (CCM) comprises mammary epithelial cell growth medium supplemented with the provided growth factors and 5% charcoal-stripped FBS, 1% L-glutamine substitute, 100 µg/mL primocin, and 10 µM fresh Y-27632.\nMincing and digesting the bladder\n\t\nTransfer and wash the bladder again with 2 mL of sterile DPBS in a 35 mm dish in a biosafety cabinet.\nCollect bladder tissues from four mice into a dish with 1 mL of CCM(-) and mince each bladder into four equal pieces using a surgical blade. Use forceps to unfold the bladder to expose the urothelium surface to the medium.\nTransfer the bladder pieces and medium into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Wash the dish with 2 mL of CCM(-) 2x and collect it in a centrifuge tube to a total volume of 5 mL.\nAdd collagenase/hyaluronidase mixture to a final concentration of 300 U/mL collagenase and 100 U/mL hyaluronidase and place the tube horizontally in a 37 °C orbital incubating shaker for 30 min at 200 rpm.\nAfter tissue digestion, add an equal volume (5 mL) of 10% charcoal-stripped FBS in DPBS into the tube and centrifuge the tube at 200 x g for 5 min.\nRemove and discard the supernatant. Add 2 mL of trypsin substitute into the cell pellet and mix well. Put the tube in a cell incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 min.",
    "After incubation, pipette up and down 10x with a standard P1000 tip. Add 5 mL of 10% charcoal-stripped FBS in DPBS.\nStrain the disassociated cells through a 100 µm sterile cell strainer. Collect the cell suspension and centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min.\nCounting and resuspending cells\n\t\nRemove and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL of CCM.\nCount the number of cells using a hemocytometer and only plate 0.5 x 106 cells into a well of a 24-well plate with 0.5 mL of fresh CCM. At this time, take out the matrix extracts of Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma cells (see Table of Materials) from -20 °C storage and thaw on ice. Pre-warm a 6-well plate in a 37 °C cell incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: The remaining cells can be centrifuged and frozen as cell pellets for non-virus transduction control.\n3. Adenoviral transduction and plating organoids\nCAUTION: Please be cautious when processing adenovirus. Laboratory personnel should follow biosafety level 2 practices and disinfect adenovirus with 10% bleach.\nAdd 2 µL of adenovirus (Ad5CMVCre; 1 x 107 PFU/µL) into the 24-well plate. Mix well with the disassociated urothelial cells.\nTo enhance transduction efficacy, perform spinoculation by centrifuging the 24-well plate at 300 x g for 30 min at room temperature. Place the 24-well plate in a cell incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 1 h.\nTransfer cells and medium from the well into a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min. Remove and discard the supernatant, add 50 µL of CCM, and mix well with the cells at the bottom.\nAdd 140 µL of matrix extract and gently mix well to avoid air bubbles. Add the solution quickly into the pre-warmed 6-well plate at 50 µL/dome to create domes for organoids.",
    "Transfer the plate into a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 gently and allow the domes to solidify for 5 min. Flip the 6-well plate upside-down and continue solidification for an additional 25 min.\nAfter incubation, add 2.5 mL of CCM to each well and place the plate in an incubator for organoid culture.\n4. Organoid culturing and passaging\nChange the medium every 3-4 days. Perform organoid culturing, passaging, and freezing as reported in Lee et al.9. Perform embedding of organoids using specimen processing gel as described in Fujii et al.10.\nRemove the medium and add 1 mL of dispase to each well. Gently break the dome and mix well with a P1000 pipette tip.\nPlace the plate in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for 30 min. Then, collect all the cells in a 15 mL centrifuge tube and wash the well with 4 mL of 10% charcoal-stripped FBS in DPBS. If the organoid cells appear as large clusters, perform Step 2.2.6. and Step 2.2.7. to get disassociated cells.\nCentrifuge the tube at 200 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and wash the cells with 1 mL of CCM.\nResuspend the cells in 70% matrix extract and follow Steps 3.4.-3.6. for culturing. Alternatively, cryopreserve the cells by resuspending in 90% charcoal-stripped FBS and 10% DMSO supplemented with 10 µM fresh Y-27632.\n5. Organoid cells implantation into C57BL/6J mouse subcutaneously\nPreparation for implantation\n\t\nPrepare 25G 1.5 in needles, a 1 mL syringe, 1 mg/mL dispase, matrix extract, 10% charcoal-stripped FBS in DPBS with 10 µM fresh Y-27632, and a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nOrganoid cell collection\n\t\nAfter achieving a stable culture for at least 5 passages, collect the expanded organoid cells for in vivo injection. Follow Steps 4.2.-4.4. and resuspend cells in 1 mL of CCM.",
    "Counting cells and subcutaneous injection\n\t\nCount the number of cells using a hemocytometer. After centrifugation at 200 x g for 5 min, resuspend 2 x 106 cells in 100 µL of 50% matrix extract in DPBS. Place the suspension on ice and take it into a biosafety cabinet in an animal procedure room.\nAnesthetize two male C57BL/6J mice (10 weeks old) with 4% isoflurane and 1 L/min O2 flow for approximately 4 min in a chamber. Once the mice have lost their righting reflex and their breathing pattern has become deeper and slower, transfer the mice to a non-rebreathing circuit with 2% isoflurane and 1 L/min O2 flow. Apply vet ointment to protect the animals' eyes from traumatic injury.\nShave one area around the injection site at the mouse's right flank and use 70% ethanol to cleanse, and then use a 25 G needle to directly inject the 100 µL cell suspension into the right flank under anesthesia.\nAfter injection, remove the inhalational anesthesia and place the mice in a cage under a heat lamp until recovered and mobilizing fully. Return the mice for housing and monitor tumor formation.\n6. Tumor collection and in vivo propagation\nFollow the preparation Step 2.1.1. Euthanize mice by CO2 asphyxiation using a 2.0 L/min flow rate followed by cervical dislocation after a tumor of ~2.0 cm diameter (nearly 2-3 weeks) is formed. Transfer the mice to a clean dissection area, spray 70% ethanol on the mouse flank tumor area, and use sterile dissection scissors and forceps to make an incision to separate the tumor.",
    "Wash the tumor in a 60 mm dish with 5 mL of DPBS and use scissors to remove the connective tissue. Cut one piece of the fresh tumor and sink it with 4% paraformaldehyde in DPBS for 48 h and send for paraffin embedding and sectioning for histology analysis.\nProcess the other half of the fresh tumor for cell disassociation. Briefly, mince the fresh tumor into 1 mm3 pieces for dissociation in a 60 mm dish with 5 mL of CCM(-). Then, after following Steps 2.2.4.-2.2.8., inject the disassociated cells into new C57BL/6J mice for in vivo passaging following Step 5.3. or keep as in vitro organoid culture following Steps 3.4.-3.6., or freeze directly in liquid nitrogen using 90% charcoal-stripped FBS and 10% DMSO with 10 µM fresh Y-27632.\nIf needed, recover the frozen cells by thawing them rapidly in a 37 °C water bath and washing with CCM(-). After this, resuspend them in 100 µL of 50% matrix extract in DPBS for direct injection into mice for in vivo tumor formation. Use at least 2 x 106 thawed cells for one in vivo injection.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
