After which, live\n      melanocytes and keratinocytes will be isolated through FACS. This is done\n      using the cell surface marker, c-Kit. The content of melanin can be\n      quantified through melanin assay.\n    \n        Trypsinize and count keratinocytes and melanocytes\n        \nNote: Prior to starting this step, do\n          have a semi-confluent dish of keratinocytes and confluent dish of\n          melanocytes accordingly. Alternatives to culture dishes would include\n          culture flasks.\n        \n            Add Trypsin to both dishes (0.25% Trypsin for keratinocytes, and\n            0.05% Trypsin for melanocytes).\n          \nIncubate for 5 min at 37°C, 5% CO2.\n            Neutralize with 10% FBS in PBS (1:1 ratio). Collect in a 15 mL\n            Falcon tube.\n          \nCentrifuge at 1200 rpm for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant using vacuum aspirator.\nAdd 1mL of respective cell medias and mix thoroughly.\nCount the number of cells.\n        Plating of co-culture\n        \nNote: On a 2D plane, the physiological\n          ratio between keratinocytes to melanocytes on the basal layer is 10:1.\n          Thus, to mimic the physiological ratio of the epidermis, the ratio for\n          co-culture would also be 10 keratinocytes to 1 melanocyte (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\n        \n            To seed at maximum density, there should be approximately 4 × 104\n            cells per growth area, cm2. The number of cells seeded\n            will correspond to the number of keratinocytes seeded.\n            \n                For example, the approximate growth area of a 6 cm dish is\n                21 cm2. Thus, the number of keratinocytes to seed\n                would be 8.4 × 105 and the number of melanocytes to\n                seed would be 8.4 × 104.\n              \n            Add the required volume to achieve the number of both population of\n            cells needed in a 15 mL Falcon tube.\n          \nCentrifuge at 1200 rpm for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant using vacuum aspirator.",

To score the pigment production and\n          transfer, quantification was done by scoring the number of double\n          positive staining of NKI within the basal layer (K14+/NKI+), and in\n          the suprabasal layer (K10+/NKI+).",
    "Quantification was done via an Image J script to encourage\n            consistency of quantification between samples and eliminates\n            possible bias which might occur.\n          \nThe Image J script used is as follows.\n            The only manual counting required would be the measuring of the\n            total length of the co-culture organotypic.\n            \nNote: Confocal imaging as stated\n              in this protocol is done using the STELLARIS Confocal Microscope,\n              and thus saved data have the extension .lif.
