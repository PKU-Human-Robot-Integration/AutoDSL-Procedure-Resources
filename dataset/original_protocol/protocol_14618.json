    "Ethical statement: Our protocol follows the guidelines established by our institutional human research ethics committee.\n1. Identification of Medically Refractory Epilepsy Patients\nPrior to invasive monitoring, evaluate allpatientswith noninvasive techniques, such as video-EEG monitoring, MRI, PET, ictalSPECT, and neuropsychological studies as described in 1 After discussion in multi-disciplinary meeting the decision whether or not to pursue invasive monitoring with SEEG must be made. 1,6,7,11,14\nForm a hypothesis regarding the location of the EZ. Develop a pre-implantation hypothesis of the presumed EZincorporating the ictal onset zone and regions of early (i.e., rapid) spread of epileptic (ictal) activity prior to intervention.\n\tNOTE: This step can be done in conjunction with the multi-disciplinary meeting when the decision is made to pursue invasive montitoring.\n\tNOTE: SEEG vs subdural grids-Based on the EZ hypothesis, decide between SEEG and subdural grid monitoring. Criteria to consider might include 1) possible deep seated EZ; 2) previous unsuccessful subdural grids monitoring; 3) indications for bilateral monitoring; 4) When non-lesional extra-temporal epilepsy is suspected. It should also be noted that additional benefit of SEEG over subdural grids includes SEEG's ability to record and stimulate critical subcortical areas when an eloquent region is hypothesized to be near the EZ.\nDevelop an individually tailored implantation strategy based upon hypothesized EZ (Figure 1).1,7,8 \n\tNOTE: Adequate implantation strategy must evaluate 1) an anatomical lesion (if present); 2) structure(s) most likely to participate inictal onset; and/or 3) possible pathway(s) of seizure propagation within a functional network. In addition to anatomic considerations, logistical considerations must also be considered. For this reason, orthogonal trajectories are in general preferential in order to facilitate implantation and, later on, interpretation of the electrode positions.",
    "After developing an implantation strategy based upon the hypothesized EZ, create a plan using the robotic assistance. First, create a new encounter, by selecting \"new patient\", then click on \"create trajectory\", then select appropriate \"entry point\" and \"end point\" which correspond with the desired trajectory.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the pre-implantation hypothesis, the number of electrodes is typically between eight and twelve. The trajectories and points of interest are typically planned using contrasted MRI or rotational angiography. These images which show not only the brain matter but the cerebral vessels allow for trajectory plans in avascular corridors to avoid vascular injury and hemorrhage.\n2. Operative Procedure\nThe day before surgery, obtain a contrasted, volumetric T1-weighted MRI sequence as described in by Kuzniecky et al.14\n\tNOTE: This image is to be used for registration with robotic assistance and must have 1 mm slices. Then transfer the images to the stereotactic neuro-navigation software, where trajectories are planned based on previously discussed implantation strategies as described by Kuzniecky et al. 14\nOnce in the operating room, place the patient on the surgical table in the supine position. Then obtain general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation as per anesthesiologists' protocol.\n\tNOTE: It is imperative that they are under general intravenous anesthesia and complete pharmacologic paralysis. Then shave the patients head, prep the skin with an antibiotic surgical application and then place the patient's head in a head neurosurgical head holder. General anesthesia differs from patient to patient.\nAfter completing the positioning attach the robotic system to the frame and complete registration. On the robotic assistance device select \"register\" and follow the prompts to complete the registration process. Complete registration using surface landmark registration based on facial features or implanted fiducial markers.\nInsertion (Figure 2)",
    "Use a 2.5-mm drill bit to drill the skull with guidance assistance from the robotic stereotactic system. Insert the monopolar coagulator probe to open the dura mater. Screw the implantation bolt into the skull, also guided by the robotic stereotactic system.\nCalculate the final depth distance for the electrode (D3) using the following measurements: [(Target-Dura Distance) + (D1 - D2) = D3]. Measure the target-dura distance using the navigation system.\n\t\tNOTE: D1 is measured as the the length of the guidance system to the dura, D2 is measured as the length of the guidance system to the end of the bolt. The D1 - D2 difference is the length of the bolt. The sum of the length of the bolt and the target-dura distance is the length of the electrode depth.\nCreate the initial trajectory by inserting a stylette probe, guided by the implanted bolt. Then insert the electrode and secure it into the bolt. This prevents further displacement and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks.\nAfter placing and connecting all electrodes, place iodine solution soaked gauze around the bolt caps. And, then wrap the head.\n3. Monitoring/Recording\nBefore finishing the case, connect the electrodes to the EEG recording machine to ensure proper functioning. The last step in the OR is intraoperative imaging (Figure 3). Perform Intraoperative x-rays or fluoroscopic imaging in the lateral and anterior-posterior skull.\n\tNOTE: Obtain these to ensure appropriate trajectories of the electrodes. These images are not obtained to ensure stereotactic placement, rather they ensure the general correct trajectory and placement of the electrodes.\nAfter surgery, transfer the patients to the epilepsy monitoring unit Monitor the patient for seizure activity both clinically and electrographically via the SEEG electrode recording.",
    "NOTE: Length of stay varies, depending on the number, quality, and ictal and interictal patterns of recordings. While monitored patients may have minor pain, treat this with acetaminophen. Typically, the length of stay is 7 days (range 3 - 28 days).\nBefore removal of electrodes, discuss regarding the patient in a multi-disciplinary conference to review recordings and hypothesis.\nAfter recording sufficient ictal data (step 3.2) and the patient has been discussed in conference, restart the patients' prior anti-epileptic medications while waiting OR for removal of electrodes.\n4. Return to OR for Removal\nAfter recording sufficient ictal data, return the patient to the operating room for removal of the SEEG electrodes. Perform this under conscious sedation; typically 2 mg midazolam IV is sufficient.\nAfter anesthesia obtain sufficient sedation (typically with midazolam [defer dosing to anesthesiologist]), remove patients head wrap and cut the electrode wires. Monitor Patient's sedation clinically by the reported pain levels with electrode removal or suture insertion. Then prep the remaining bolt and tail of the electrode using iodinated gel.\nIndividually, remove each bolt cap by twisting it off, followed by the electrode and lastly remove the bolt. Remove the electrodes by gently pulling them out along the axis of their insertion. Then remove the bolt by twisting it out, typically do this using fingers.\nBefore moving on to the next electrode, close the defect left by the bolt with one stitch of nylon suture. Repeat these steps for each electrode. After removing all the electrodes, cover the stitch areas with antibiotic ointment and a loose head wrap.\nAfter removal, obtain further imaging either CT or A/P and lateral x-rays to ensure no residual hardware.",
    "NOTE: Possible resection-If a surgical resection was believed to be of benefit to the patient's epilepsy then plan for a craniotomy and resection roughly 6 weeks after removal. This delay is due to infectious concerns of operating during the same hospitalization as the monitoring period.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
