    "This research was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethical committee of Helsinki University Hospital. Signed informed consent was obtained from each patient.\n1. Preparation of Solutions, Media and Equipment\nPrepare the following equipment prior to collection of the fibrovascular tissue (FT) to ensure rapid processing.\n\t\nSterile-autoclave two microdissection tweezers.\nPrepare 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) by dissolving 1 pre-weighed PBS tablet (0.14 M NaCl, 0.0027 M KCl, 0.010 M PO4-3) in 900 mL of deionized water and stir to dissolve. Adjust the water volume up to 1 L and sterile-autoclave the ready solution. Store at RT.\nGather the above mentioned solution and equipment in a basket, together with a single-use sterile scalpel, a sterile 6-cm cell culture dish and five sterile 12-well cell culture plates.\nPrepare a 6 mg/mL fibrinogen solution in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) by dissolving 30 mg of plasminogen-depleted human fibrinogen into 5 mL of HBSS, using a 50 mL tube immersed into a water bath at 37 °C, for at least 1 h.\n\tNOTE: This solution can be kept in the water bath (37 °C) for 7 h (maximum 10 h) before use.\nPrepare the ex vivo culture medium by adding 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) or 5% human serum, 0.4% endothelial cell growth supplement, 10 ng/mL recombinant human epidermal growth factor, 1 μg/mL hydrocortisone, and 50 μg/mL gentamycin to commercially available endothelial cell growth medium and keep in water bath at 37 °C until use. Store at 4 °C for up to a month.\n2. Fibrovascular Tissue Dissection\nCollect the fibrovascular tissue (FT) that has been excised from human subjects undergoing trans-conjunctival microincision vitreoretinal surgery, by 23 or 20 gauge three-port pars plana vitrectomy as part of the vitreoretinal surgical management of PDR.",
    "NOTE: The FT is excised using segmentation and delamination, cut if needed with microscissors, and removed from the vitreous cavity with intraocular end-gripping microforceps by experienced vitreoretinal surgeon. Extreme care needs to be taken to remove intact, undamaged FT without causing damage to ocular structures including the optic nerve or temporal vascular arcade where the pathological neovascular tissue is most commonly located. The size of the excised tissue is variable, usually ranging between 3 and 50 mm2.\nKeep the FT in a 6 cm cell culture dish or 1.5 mL tube containing 1 mL of sterile PBS placed on wet ice, and transfer it immediately to research laboratory for processing.\n\tNOTE: It is essential that the research unit (lab facilities) are physically close to the hospital operating room (OR) to minimize the transfer times of the small excised FT. In this case the transfer takes less than 5 minutes and the explants are embedded within fibrin usually in 1 - 1.5 h (maximum 2 h) after surgical removal. The impact of longer transfer times on the 3D culture would need to be tested.\nPlace the FT in a 6-cm cell culture dish containing 1 mL of PBS at room temperature (RT, 25 °C) and acquire images of the tissue using an inverted epifluorescence microscope with a 5x objective.\n\tNOTE: Images are acquired for qualitative assessment and documentation. It will be possible to observe the tissue size, density and general composition (e.g., vascular structures).\nCut the FT into ~1 mm2 pieces under an upright dissection stereomicroscope, using a sterile scalpel and microdissection tweezers. Hold the tissue, well submerged in PBS, in place using a microdissection tweezer, and perform clear cuts using a sterile scalpel. Avoid tearing FT, as this would alter the native fibrovascular structures.",
    "Place each individual piece into a well of a 12-well cell culture plate containing 1 mL of sterile PBS.\n\tNOTE: If needed, gently spread the FT onto the plate, using microdissection tweezers, prior to performing cuts.\n3. Casting Upright Fibrin Gel Droplets for the Characterization of Native FT and Ex Vivo Culture\nSterile-filter the ready fibrinogen solution prepared in step 1.2 with a 0.22 μm filter mounted into a 10 mL syringe.\nPrepare aliquots of the fibrinogen solution (25 μL per 1.5 mL tube) and keep at RT. Prepare an aliquot for fibrin gel/every FT piece obtained after the dissection, and a couple of extra aliquots for testing the fibrin gel formation.\nPrepare a solution of HBSS containing 4 units/mL of thrombin and 400 μg/mL of aprotinin, called hereafter TA solution, and keep at RT. Prepare as much TA solution as needed, depending on the number of pieces obtained after dissection (25 μL of TA solution is used for each FT/fibrin gel), and an extra amount (e.g., 250 μL) for testing the fibrin gel formation and ensuring that enough solution is available throughout casting of the fibrin gel droplets.\n\tNOTE: Thrombin is required for fibrin polymerization while aprotinin is added to prevent degradation of the fibrin gel by cellular proteases expressed by the FTs13,14.\nTest the timing of fibrin gel formation: add 25 μL of TA solution to the aliquoted 25 μL fibrinogen solution prepared in step 3.2 and, using another pipette set to 50 μL, mix in the tube by pipetting and dispense into a 6 cm cell culture dish, forming an upright droplet.",
    "NOTE: The fibrin gel formation should take place in ~1 min. If this takes over 1.5 min, the concentration of thrombin in the TA solution prepared in step 3.3 can be increased by adding more thrombin stock solution. One tenth of the initially used volume of thrombin stock solution can be added, repeatedly, until the fibrin gel formation occurs within 1.5 min. The time of fibrin gel formation is critical for the three dimensionality of the culture, as quick gel formation (within 1.5 minutes) prevents the FT piece from sinking to the bottom of the fibrin gel, and thus coming in contact with the 2D plastic surface of the cell culture plate, which can lead to 2D cell adhesion and outgrowth.\nPlace one FT piece at the center of one well of a 24-well plate using a sterile tweezer and remove any excess PBS by pipetting with a 0.5-10 μL pipette to avoid suction force on the FT. In the case the tissue sticks to the tweezer, use an additional tweezer to aid the placement of the tissue piece on the plate.\n\tNOTE: FT/fibrin gels can also be cast on 48-well plate to reduce the usage of reagents. However, this is more challenging as the space is more limited and fibrin will spread if it comes into contact with the well wall.\nAdd 25 μL of TA solution to the 25 μL fibrinogen solution aliquoted in step 3.2, and using another pipette set to 50 μL mix in the tube by pipetting. Dispense onto the FT piece placed on the plate well, and pipette up and down 2- 3 times in order to include the FT piece within the upright droplet, providing a 3D surrounding matrix to the FT.",
    "NOTE: Ensure that the FT is not aspirated during pipetting and that no air bubbles are formed. Ensure also that mixing, dispensation and pipetting are performed quickly as the fibrin gel will form within 1.5 min, as tested in step 3.4. If casting fibrin gels on 48-well plate, use instead 20 μL of fibrinogen solution and 20 μL of TA solution.\nRepeat steps 3.5 and 3.6 for all the FT pieces.\nAllow the fibrin gels to solidify by incubating the plates in a cell culture incubator at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.\nAfter 0.5-1 h, check that the fibrin gel is completely formed by carefully tilting the plate. Proceed to step 3.10 when the gel does not move as the plate is tilted, indicating that the fibrin gel formation is complete.\nOverlay the FT/fibrin gels with ex vivo culture medium (600 μL/well in 24-well plate or 300 μL/well in 48-well plate) supplemented with 100 μg/mL aprotinin. Pipette the medium gently by drop-wise dispensation.\n\tNOTE: Here, aprotinin is used to prevent degradation of the fibrin gel by cellular proteases expressed by the FTs13,14. The ex vivo culture medium can additionally be supplemented with recombinant growth factors, such as VEGFA, VEGFC, bFGF, TGFβ (see Table of Materials)11.\nPlace the FT ex vivo culture plate back into the 37 °C, 5% CO2 cell culture incubator and culture for the desired time period (e.g., 2- 18 days, longer culture periods will need to be tested). Replace 50% of the medium with fresh ex vivo culture medium every three days.\n4. “In Matrix” Imaging\nAcquire images of the FT ex vivo cultures on the same day (day 0) and at set intervals (e.g., every other day), using an inverted epifluorescence microscope, in order to follow the 3D growth.",
    "NOTE: The images obtained can be used for the quantification of the FT outgrowth as the total length of two perpendicular diameters across the explant11.\n5. Native FT and Ex Vivo Culture End-Point\nNOTE: The FT/fibrin gels can be cultured ex vivo for the desired time period (FT ex vivo cultures) or fixed on the same day (native FT) for native FT characterization11.\nFix the native FT or the FT ex vivo cultures by replacing the culture medium with 1 mL/well of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS solution, for 1 h at RT. For the native FT/fibrin gels, fix 0.5-1 h after addition of the ex vivo culture medium (if the fibrin gels have not been soaked in medium, fixation will damage them).\n\tNOTE: Perform this step in fume hood as paraformaldehyde is corrosive, toxic and carcinogenic.\nRinse the FT/fibrin gels with three 5 min washes in PBS (2 mL/well).\nReplace the PBS with 2 mL/well of PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide and store the fixed fibrin gels at 4 °C until further processing. Seal the plates with paraffin film to ensure that the FT/fibrin gels do not dry in storage.\n\tNOTE: Perform this step in fume hood as sodium azide is toxic.\n6. Whole-Mount Immunofluorescence Staining\nNOTE: This protocol lasts 5 days and can be interrupted with overnight incubations where indicated. Do not let the fibrin gels dry at any point. All steps are performed at RT unless otherwise indicated.\nPrepare the following solutions before starting the staining protocol.\n\t\nPost-fixation solution: prepare 50:50 acetone:methanol solution by mixing equal amounts of acetone and methanol (e.g., 50 mL). Store at -20 °C. Prepare this solution latest on the day before the staining. This solution can be stored back at -20 °C and be used for subsequent stainings.",
    "NOTE: Prepare this solution in fume hood as acetone and methanol are flammable and hazardous to health.\nBlocking solution: prepare a 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.3% octyl phenol ethoxylate solution in PBS by first adding 15% FBS to PBS. Add octyl phenol ethoxylate and stir to dissolve. Store at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: This solution can be prepared in large amount in advance, stored in 15 mL aliquotes at -20 °C and thawed before use, on the day when the staining protocol is started. Use a freshly prepared or freshly thawed aliquote for each staining protocol.\nWashing solution: Prepare 1 L of PBS supplemented with 0.45% octyl phenol ethoxylate by adding 4.5 mL of octyl phenol ethoxylate to 995.5 mL of PBS. Stir to dissolve. Store at RT.\nLift the droplets carefully from the plate by using a stainless steel square-edged spatula. Detach the droplet first from the edges before lifting the center, and transfer to a well of 12-well plate containing 1 mL of PBS.\n\tNOTE: Perform post-fixation, washes and blocking steps in this plate format.\nPost-fix the droplets with 1 mL of ice-cold 50:50 acetone:methanol solution for ~1 min (the border of the droplets will turn white).\n\tNOTE: Perform this step in fume hood as acetone and methanol are hazardous to health.\nRinse with 3 - 5 washes in 2 mL of PBS (the droplets will sink in the PBS solution when rehydration is complete).\n\tNOTE: Avoid touching the droplets with the pipette tip as, after post-fixation, they are sticky to plastic. Throughout the protocol, avoid aspirating post-fix, antibody, blocking and washing solutions by suction, as this may damage or completely destroy the droplets. Instead, tilt the plate and carefully remove solutions using a 500-5,000 μL pipette.",
    "Centrifuge the blocking solution for 15 min at 21,000 x g and 4 °C in order to remove debris.\n\tNOTE: The solution can be aliquoted in 1.5 mL tubes for centrifugation. The unused solution can be stored at 4 °C and used for all relevant subsequent steps.\nIncubate the droplets in 500 μL blocking solution for 2 h at RT.\n\tNOTE: To reduce the volume of blocking solution used, the plate can be tilted on a support and as little as 300 μL of solution/droplet can be used.\nPrepare the primary antibody mixture (at least 30 μL/droplet) at appropriate dilution in blocking solution and centrifuge for 15 min at 21,000 x g and 4 °C.\nTransfer the droplets into round (U)-bottom 96-well plate by using a round-edged spatula, and incubate with at least 30 μL/droplet of the primary antibody mixture overnight at 4 °C.\nOn the following day, transfer the droplets into 12-well plate containing 2 mL of washing solution/well, rinse with three 5 min washes first and then with nine 30 min washes. Leave the last wash (2 mL) overnight at 4 °C.\nOn the following day, rinse three times with PBS and transfer the droplets into round (U)-bottom 96-well plate.\nDuring the washes, prepare the appropriate fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody mixture (diluted 1:500, at least 30 μL/droplet) in blocking solution and centrifuge for 15 min at 21,000 x g and 4 °C.\nTransfer the droplets into a round (U)-bottom 96-well plate by using a round-edged spatula and incubate with at least 30 μL of the secondary antibody mixture, for 4 h at RT, protected from light.\n\tNOTE: Perform all subsequent incubations and washing steps protected from light.",
    "Transfer the droplets into 12-well plate containing 2 mL of washing solution/well using a round-edged spatula, rinse with three 5 min washes first and then with four 30 min washes. Leave the last wash (2 mL) overnight at 4 °C.\nOn the following day, rinse the gels with five 30 min washes and then three times with PBS. Leave the last wash (2 mL) overnight at 4 °C.\nOn the following day, transfer the droplets into a round (U)-bottom 96-well plate by using a round-edged spatula and counterstain nuclei by incubating with 10 μg/mL Hoechst nuclear stain (at least 30 μL/droplet) for 30 minutes at RT.\n\tNOTE: Mounting medium supplemented with 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for nuclei counterstaining can alternatively be used. In which case, this step and step 6.16 are skipped, proceeding directly to step 6.17.\nTransfer the droplets into 12-well plate containing 2 mL of PBS/well using a round-edged spatula and rinse three times with PBS.\nMount the droplets onto microscope slide as follows:\n\t\nApply a narrow layer of quick-hardening mounting medium on the edges of a square-shaped 22 mm x 22 mm coverglass and let dry for ~1 minute. Perform this step for each drop individually, to avoid excessive hardening of the mounting medium.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform this step in fume hood as the quick-hardening mounting medium is hazardous to health.\nRinse the droplet by dipping in a well of a 12-well plate containing 2 mL of deionized water and transfer onto a microscope slide, using a round-edged spatula. Remove excess water by using a small piece of absorbent paper.\nDispense 15 μL of non-hardening antifade mounting medium onto the droplet.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, if Hoechst nuclear stain has not been used, mounting medium containing 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) can be used.",
    "Gently position the cover glass, with the quick-hardening mounting medium facing the microscopic slide, over the droplet and let settle.\n\t\tNOTE: The quick-hardening medium will stick to the microscopic slide and keep the droplet in place.\nRepeat step 6.17 for all droplets. Mount two droplets on each microscope slide.\nLet the slides air-dry at RT for ~2 h and store at 4 °C overnight. Ensure that the slides are positioned horizontally and protected from light.\nImage the stained native or end-point FT ex vivo cultures using a confocal microscope or an upright epifluorescence microscope equipped with an optical sectioning function and 20x or 40x objective. Use tile function to capture a greater area of the tissue at once.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
