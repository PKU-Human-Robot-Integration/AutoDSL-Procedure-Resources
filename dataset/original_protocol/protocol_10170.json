    "1. Colony-level Rearing of WCR Adults\nObtain a sufficient quantity of WCR adults (500 - 1,000) from a reliable company or research laboratory (see Table of Materials for an example) and place in a 30 cm3 cage.\n\tNOTE: Use of a non-diapausing strain is highly recommended.\nPrepare WCR artificial diet following manufacturer's protocol and pour a 1 cm-thick layer into a 38 oz container (see Table of Materials). After mixing, store unused diet at 4 °C for up to 2 months.\nPut a Petri dish (100 x 15 mm) with adult diet (10 - 15 g) into a 30 cm3 cage. Add more diet when the food is low or dry.\nPut a flask (300 mL) with water, covered with a cotton ball, which is used to hold in place a cotton roll (6\" x 3/8\"), to serve as a water source. Change the water when it runs low.\nMaintain WCR at 26 °C with 60% humidity and a 14:10 light cycle in an insect rearing incubator.\n2. Embryo Collection and Alignment\nMake an egg collection chamber using 1% agar in water in a sterile 100 x 15 mm2 Petri dish. Store at 4 °C after the agar solidifies.\nTo collect newly laid eggs, place a single layer of filter paper, followed by 4 layers of cheesecloth (each cut to size) on the surface of the agar (Figure 1A).\n\tNOTE: Cheesecloth can be reused, after being washed in bleach and autoclaved, but it is not necessary to do this for the first use. Filter paper should not be reused and does not need to be sterilized.\nPlace egg collection plate into WCR cage as late in the day as possible (end of work day) and cover with a tinfoil tent. Leave overnight.",
    "NOTE: Having the lights on from 10 A.M. to 12 A.M. (14 h) delays egg laying, thus facilitating the collection of younger eggs for microinjection without requiring lab personnel to place collection chamber into cage late at night.\nRemove the egg collection chamber around 8 or 9 A.M.\nUse forceps to pick up 1 layer of cheesecloth at a time and place in a beaker (500 mL) of water. Wash eggs off of cheesecloth by gently stirring (Figure 1B and 1C).\nUse a bulb pipette to transfer eggs to another beaker (500 mL) of water. Repeat 2 - 3x to clean the eggs.\nUse the bulb pipette to transfer eggs onto filter paper (Figure 1D) while minimizing the amount of water carry-over.\nCut black filter paper into strips as wide as a glass slide and tape firmly to the slide to make sure the paper lays flat (Figure 2A).\n\tNOTE: Black filter paper helps improve visibility under the microscope by reducing the amount of reflected light.\nApply non-toxic glue (see Table of Materials for an example) to the filter paper in fine lines (Figure 2B). Keep the glue lines thinner than the diameter of an egg to avoid getting the eggs coated in glue.\nUse a fine brush to gently move WCR eggs one by one from their filter paper to the glue line. Try to lay the eggs on the glue before it dries out and keep at least one egg's distance between each egg.\nMaximize injection efficiency by placing multiple lines of eggs on one filter paper slide (Figure 3).\nAfter all eggs are laid out on the filter paper, wait until all the glue dries before microinjection.",
    "NOTE: For germline transformation and for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing, inject all embryos by noon (12 P.M.) so that the oldest embryo is no more than 19 h old. However, for RNAi, there is no time limitation because, in WCR, dsRNA can move between cells. In fact, for RNAi, aging embryos might result in better survival rates.\n3. Preparation of Plasmid DNAs and Injection Needles\nPrepare high-quality supercoiled plasmid DNA using an endotoxin-free commercial kit (see Table of Materials for an example).\nTo prepare the injection solution, check the concentration of each plasmid and then combine helper plasmid (250 ng/µL final concentration), donor plasmid (750 ng/µL final concentration) and phenol red buffer (20% final concentration). Vortex the solution briefly and centrifuge for 3 min at maximum speed to precipitate particles that could clog the needle.\nPull borosilicate glass needles (O.D. 1 mm, I.D. 0.58 mm, 10 cm length) using a Flaming/Brown type micropipette puller. For storage, secure pulled needles on double-sided sticky tape in a Petri dish or other clear container.\n\tNOTE: For the micropipette puller system, the settings used were: Heat = 335, FIL = 4, VEL = 40, DEL = 200, PUL = 100.\nBackfill the injection needle by using a micro-loader tip (see Table of Materials) to pipet 0.5 - 1.0 µL down inside the needle, near the tapered end. Remove bubbles from the tip of the needle if any occur.\nInsert the injection needle into the needle holder.\nOpen the tip of the needle by gently breaking with a fine pair of forceps, or gently touching/dragging the tip on the coverslip or glass slide.",
    "NOTE: The goal is to have the smallest opening that still allows the injection mix to come out (smaller openings generally require higher injection pressure). Beveled needles don't require this step since they are already open.\n4. Microinjection and Post-injection Care\nUsing a fine paintbrush, carefully wet the surface of 1 - 3 eggs with sterile water, insert the needle, and inject the solution. Inject each egg before the surface dries. Look for the appearance a small amount of red color inside eggs during injection to indicate the successful microinjection. Crush or remove any eggs that look damaged, empty, or otherwise cannot be injected.\n\tNOTE: Although injection pressure varies based on needle bore size, 10 - 13 psi is a good starting point.\nAfter all eggs are injected, remove the filter paper from the glass slide.\nPlace the filter paper on the surface of a 1% agar dish (described above).\nUse plastic paraffin film to seal the dish, and put in a 26 °C insect rearing incubator for 12 days.\n\tNOTE: The paraffin film will help prevent cross-contamination of mold between dishes. However, any other treatment to prevent mold and bacterial growth could reduce the survival of the injected embryos.\n5. Culturing and Hatching of Embryos\nStart checking embryos 12 days post-injection for newly-hatched larvae and continue daily for the next 2 weeks.\nTransfer larvae, using a fine brush, to a rearing box with sprouted corn and soil.\n\tNOTE: Mold might grow in the agar dish, but larvae will still hatch in most cases. Look for larvae carefully within the mold to catch them all. Some larvae might move to the lid of the dish and might get stuck in the condensation.\nRear larvae at 26 °C following standard WCR rearing methods25.\nSubscription Required.
