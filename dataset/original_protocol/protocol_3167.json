Work in the\n      flow hood to keep cells and materials sterile. While we grow cells here on\n      coverslips, other formats including glass-bottom imaging plates or Lab-Tek\n      chambers can be used, depending on individual requirements.\n    \n        Coat coverslips with the desired ECM protein as described in step 3 of\n        prepare buffers, cell culture media, and substrates[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2].\n      \n        Trypsinize cells, seed the appropriate cell density in culture medium on\n        coated coverslips in a 24-well plate, and place in the incubator at 37°C\n        and 5% CO2.\n      \nNote: The time required depends on the\n      cell type, matrix used, the type of adhesion complex to be visualized and\n      the purpose of the experiment. While FA formation during initial cell\n      adhesion and cell spreading can be visible as early as 10 min after\n      seeding, other complexes such as FBs may appear later in cell cultures\n      where there is also abundant FN deposition. HDs are usually best\n      visualized by first letting cells adhere and spread in culture medium, and\n      then incubate the cells in high calcium for 18 h (to stimulate HD\n      assembly) prior to fixation.\n    \nNote: 12-mm diameter circular coverslips\n      are recommended for a 24-well plate.\n    \nNote: (Transfection or transduction with)\n      different constructs may affect proliferation in different ways. By\n      seeding multiple coverslips per condition in different densities,\n      coverslips with similar confluency can be selected at the time of the\n      experiment.\n    \n        Perform any required experiment (i.e., drug treatment, cytokine or\n        growth factor addition, etc).\n      \n        Aspirate the medium and wash once with PBS containing\n        MgCl2/CaCl2 to remove medium and/or serum\n        components.\n      \nNote: MgCl2 and CaCl2\n      are required to maintain integrin- and cadherin-dependent cell adhesion",
    "complexes, respectively.\n    \nFix with 500 μL of 4% PFA for 15 min at 20°C.\nPause point: Cells fixed with PFA\n      can be stored at 4°C for up to a week. Seal the plate with parafilm to\n      avoid evaporation.\n    \nWash 2 times with PBS.\n        Permeabilize with 500 μL of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at 4°C.\n      \nWash Triton away with 2 washes in PBS.\nNote: The use of MgCl2 and\n      CaCl2 in PBS is no longer required after fixation. However,\n      some antibodies may require calcium for binding.\n    \n        Block non-specific binding with 0.1 M glycine in PBS for 2 h at 20°C.\n      \nCritical: Glycine blocks reactivity of\n      free aldehyde groups that can bind antibodies, and thereby reduces\n      non-specific (background) staining. Other strategies to block non-specific\n      binding include the use of bovine serum albumin fraction V, serum, or fish\n      skin gelatin (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\n    \nWash coverslips 3 times with PBS containing 0.2% gelatin.\nDilute primary antibodies in PBS with 0.2% gelatin.\n        Place a piece of clean parafilm on the bench and pipet drops of antibody\n        solution, evenly spaced, on it. For a 12-mm coverslip, 30 μL should\n        suffice.\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2937-Fig3.jpg\n              Figure 3.

    "(D) Examples of unrealistically small FAs (left,\n              blue arrows) which can be excluded from analysis based on\n              size (right). Similarly, clusters of adhesions that are not\n              properly segmented (red ovals) and are therefore\n              arbitrarily counted as 1 large FA, could also be excluded.\n            \n              (E) Example of the effect of watershed (right, red arrows)\n              on FA segmentation (compare to original image left).\n            \nNote: This step is to reduce the amount of\n      antibody used for labeling. Alternatively, staining can be performed by\n      incubation of the coverslips in the well plate but this requires much\n      larger volumes.\n    \nNote: Several different antibodies can be\n      used to visualize FAs that will result in similar staining, including\n      antibodies directed against vinculin, paxillin, focal adhesion kinase\n      (FAK), phosphorylated paxillin or FAK, or phosphotyrosines in general (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). The choice of which marker is best will depend on cell type and\n      individual demands.\n    \n        Put 1 coverslip (with cells down) on each drop of antibody solution.\n      \nNote: Handle coverslips using tweezers\n      with a pointed tip. To grab coverslips with tweezers, they can be lifted\n      easily with a syringe needle that has been pressed onto a hard surface to\n      create a lightly-bended tip.\n    \nNote: Remove superfluous PBS on the\n      coverslip by gently holding it on its side against a tissue.\n    \nIncubate for 45–60 min at 20°C.\n        Put coverslips back in PBS with 0.2% gelatin in the 12-wells plate with\n        the cells facing up.\n      \nWash cells 3 times with PBS containing 0.2% gelatin for 10 min.\nCritical: When aspirating medium and\n      replenishing, be careful to avoid cells drying out during the staining\n      procedure.\n    \n        Dilute secondary antibodies in PBS with 0.2% gelatin and pipet drops on\n        parafilm as in step 12. Phalloidin and Hoechst can also be included in\n        this step.\n      \nPut coverslips on antibody solutions as in step 13.",
    "Incubate for 30–60 min at 20°C in the dark.\nCritical: We use phalloidin to\n      visualize actin filaments (F-actin) and Hoechst to image the nuclei. Both\n      stains are very bright and stain quickly (Hoechst stains already within\n      5 min). In general, it is recommended to first determine the best\n      conditions for labeling of phalloidin and antibodies (ie concentration,\n      incubation times). Some antibodies stain better on MeOH-fixed cells than\n      on cells fixed with PFA (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\n    \nCritical: Phalloidin is dissolved in\n      DMSO. Wear protective clothing, gloves, and eye/face protection when\n      handling DMSO or the DMSO dye solution. DMSO easily penetrates the skin\n      and facilitates the absorption of organic molecules into tissues. Dispose\n      of waste and materials in compliance with the appropriate local\n      regulations.\n    \nTransfer coverslips again to plate as in step 15.\nWash coverslips 3 times with PBS containing 0.2% gelatin.\nWash coverslips twice with PBS.\n        Mount coverslips with cells face-down in 10% Mowiol on object slide. For\n        12-mm coverslips, 10–20 μL of Mowiol is sufficient.\n      \nNote: Mowiol is viscous. To facilitate\n      pipetting, use pipette tips with cut opening.\n    \nNote: 5% Dabco 33-LV (an anti-fade agent)\n      can be added to the Mowiol before mounting.\n    \nNote: Very gently press the coverslip down\n      to bring it close to the object slide.\n    \nLet Mowiol harden for at least 16 h at RT.\n        Carefully clean the non-cell-side of the mounted coverslip with a tissue\n        with EtOH, then store coverslips at 4°C or −20°C.\n      \nNote: Sealing coverslips with clear nail\n      polish along their edge will prevent dehydration.\n    \nPause point: Coverslips mounted in\n      Mowiol can be stored for weeks at 4°C or even months at −20°C.\n    \nNote: Instead of Mowiol, also commercial\n      mounting media can be used, such as Vectashield. Some of these contain\n      DAPI to stain nuclei during embedding, or ‘anti-fade agents’ to protect",
    "fluorescent dyes from fading due to photobleaching.\n    \n      Confocal imaging of cell-matrix adhesions in fixed cells\n    \nTiming: 1–8 h\n      This method describes how to image cell-matrix adhesions in cells on\n      coverslips, using an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope such as\n      the Leica SP8 system used here.\n    \n        Select the 63× objective (used here: Leica 63×/1,40 oil HC plan\n        apochromatic CS objective).\n      \n        Apply immersion oil type F on coverslip and place upside down (facing\n        the objective) in the microscope stage insert.\n      \n        Select the appropriate laser lines. We used excitation at 405 nm for\n        Hoechst, 488 nm for FITC- or AlexaFluor 488, 561/594 nm for Texas Red,\n        and 633/647 nm for Cy5).\n      \n        Set laser/gain and other confocal settings. Here we acquired images\n        with: image dimensions 2048 × 2048 pixels, scan speed 200 Hz,\n        bidirectional scanning, and performing sequential scanning between\n        channels (to avoid crosstalk between fluorophores).\n      \n        Select the basal focal plane to focus on cell-matrix adhesions and\n        optimize laser and gain settings.\n      \n        To reduce noise and enhance specific signal, perform line or frame\n        averaging.\n      \nNote: When comparing different conditions,\n      capture images with the same confocal settings for all conditions (first\n      optimize settings on the control condition).\n    \nNote: The settings mentioned here will\n      result in high-resolution images. For the imaging of large numbers of\n      cells/conditions, scanning time can be reduced using resonant scanning\n      or by limiting the number of averaging steps. In addition, lower image\n      dimensions (e.g., 1024 × 1024 or 512 × 512) will reduce the time required\n      for imaging. Finally, simultaneous acquisition can be used, rather than\n      sequential scanning. All of these steps will result in lower resolution\n      but may still be sufficient for proper visualization and quantification.\n    \nNote: Because of cell-to-cell\n      heterogeneity and variability in FA number and size, it is advised to",
    "image and analyze multiple cells (at least 10) per condition.\n    \n      Automated analysis of cell-matrix adhesions in fixed cells\n    \nTiming: 5 min–2 h\n    \n      This method makes use of the macro “FA Analyzer” developed by us,\n      which is available from GitHub:https://github.com/agclark12/FA_analyzer[href=https://github.com/agclark12/FA_analyzer]. The package contains a single Python/Jython script that can be opened\n      and run directly in Fiji/ImageJ. Here we exemplify the use of this macro\n      on FA/F-actin confocal images. The macro will identify and analyze\n      individual FAs on pre-processed images as indicated below (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). Thresholding is a common step to segment adhesions. The macro uses a\n      thresholding algorithm to overcome the need for manual input of values for\n      thresholding. Moreover, the macro includes a watershed step for further\n      segmentation of individual adhesions (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C, 3D\n      and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). The resulting data can be used to extract FA\n      properties from single cells or combined to look at average properties in\n      cell populations (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). The required time for\n      analysis will depend on the number of images, binning options, and the\n      computer used.\n    \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2937-Fig4.jpg\n          Figure 4.

The FA image should be single channel, 8- or\n      16-bit, any image size is fine.\n    \nNote: The script will automatically create\n      new directories for storing data, which will be named according to the FA\n      images.

Then restart ImageJ and you will be able to find and run FA\n      analyzer directly from the “Plugins” menu.\n    \nNote: By default, the distance of\n      \"peripheral\" FAs to the cell border is less than 10% of the\n      maximum distance from the border to the center of the cell; this 10%\n      fraction is defined in the main function at the end of the script and can\n      be changed, but it should be kept consistent for all images that are to be\n      compared.\n    \nNote: The means and standard deviations\n      (std) of most of the FA parameters are also stored in the image data.csv\n      file. For convenience, all of the FA and image data are collected together\n      in .csv files that are saved to the directory containing the images.\n    \nNote: Area and perimeter data are always\n      given in pixels. This avoids errors due to inconsistencies in images that\n      already have pixel sizes defined in the image metadata. It is recommended\n      to convert such values to real physical values (microns, e.g.). As this\n      conversion will be different for individual images that were acquired with\n      different imaging parameters (zoom/objectives, e.g.), it is best to be\n      consistent with imaging parameters for a given set of images that will be\n      analyzed together.\n    \n        Analyze data.\n        \nClose ImageJ and open the .csv files.\nAnalyze data.",
    "Note: To exclude unrealistically small\n      FAs, the cut-off for adhesion size can be adjusted in the sheet (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). A similar approach can be adopted to exclude FAs that are\n      unrealistically large, or clustered FAs that are not properly segmented\n      and therefore appear as 1 large FA rather than several small ones (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). Focal adhesion size is on average between 1 and 10 μm in most cell\n      types.\n    \nNote: Graphs can be created directly in\n      Excel or using GraphPad Prism. The latter also allows direct statistical\n      analysis. Start from data table or graph → Analyze → choose the\n      appropriate method of statistical analysis, depending on experimental\n      set-up and number of conditions.\n    \nNote: It is recommended to use images with\n      a maximal pixel size of 0.15–0.3 μm/pixel to allow for accurate detection\n      and separation of individual FAs. In addition, sufficiently high\n      signal-to-noise must be achieved in order to detect FAs from the\n      background signal. Improvement of signal-to-noise ratio prior to analyzing\n      the FAs is performed by background subtraction in Fiji. If the background\n      signal is still too high, consider adjusting the staining conditions (troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\n    \nNote: Segmentation of individual FAs may\n      be difficult or even impossible in cases where adhesions form large\n      clusters. Watershed is performed by the macro to perform FA segmentation\n      but may also induce artefacts (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E) (troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]). In cases where FAs seem continuous and segmentation is problematic,\n      the adhesive area may be more informative than the number of adhesions\n      (see for example the adhesions formed by the β3Δ756 mutant in\n      Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\n    \nLive imaging of FAs using TIRF microscopy\nTiming: 30 min–8 h\n    \n      This method describes how to collect images of the dynamic behavior of FAs\n      by time-lapse TIRF imaging, using mCherry-vinculin in GE11 cells\n      expressing wild-type or mutant integrin β1 (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]",

As for the analysis of adhesion complexes\n      in fixed cells, it is essential that the complexes under investigation\n      appear as discrete structures that can be recognized as individual",

Therefore this type\n      of analysis is not suitable for large structures such as HDs, while it can\n      be applied in many instances to FAs and/or FBs.\n    \nNote: It is crucial that the software\n      recognizes the same adhesion in consecutive frames.

Some adhesions have a long lifetime and thus\n      low turnover rates, and can move along the ligand, largely following\n      cellular morphological changes (‘sliding adhesions’). In contrast,\n      adhesion dynamics can be characterized mainly by rapid disassembly and\n      de novo re-assembly, leading to shorter lifetime and high turnover\n      rates (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1], S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2],\n      Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] for examples).\n    \nNote: The quality of the input data is\n      crucial for proper analysis.

Two\n          square regions of β4-GFP were selected (RO1 and ROI2) and\n          photo-bleached through a high-power laser excitation. The recovery of\n          fluorescence in the bleached area was monitored by taking images every\n          15 s for 5 min as described in\n          fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.7]. To correct for photobleaching during this period, time-lapses of\n          separate regions (ROI3 and ROI4) with identical acquisition settings\n          to those used during the FRAP experiments were acquired. Time-lapses\n          of a region (ROI5) outside the cells did not reveal any fluorescence.\n        \n          (B) Time-course of changes in fluorescence intensity in the bleached\n          regions (ROI1 and ROI2), the surroundings (ROI4 and ROI5), and\n          background (ROI3).\n        \n          (C) After background subtraction, compensation for imaging-induced\n          photobleaching, and normalization, the recovery was fit with a single\n          exponential curve (one-phase association) to calculate the half-time\n          of recovery. Note that in this example, the fit was performed on the\n          averaged normalized FRAP curves of only two ROI’s, but a combination\n          of multiple ROIs from independent experiments is recommended.\n        \n        Seed A431 cells on large circular coverslips (24 mm diameter) in\n        DMEM/FCS.",

The microscope should be prewarmed and\n        atmospherically stabilized at 37°C and 5% CO2.\n      \n        Select the appropriate laser lines (in this case for excitation at\n        488 nm) and settings (intensity, time interval, etc), depending on the\n        expression levels and dynamics of the protein investigated, as well as\n        cell type and stimuli (for instance specific growth factors).\n      \n        Record 2 images of selected ROIs as pre-bleaching controls and 1 image\n        as background control.

This will allow live-cell imaging of integrin movement through\n      the membrane, for instance of ligand-bound integrins along FN fibrils,34[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34]\n      or assessment of integrin endocytosis and recycling by pulse-chase\n      assays.21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21],35[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35],36[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36] Here we describe a\n      protocol for the synchronized endocytosis of β1 and β4 integrins in human\n      keratinocytes and visualization by confocal laser scanning microscopy.\n    \n        Culture cells in appropriate medium as described in\n        cell culture and passage[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3] and on wells coated with\n        appropriate ECM protein if necessary, as described in step 3 of\n        prepare buffers, cell culture media, and substrates[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2].\n      \n        Seed cells on coated circular coverslips (12 mm diameter) in a 24 well\n        plate in culture medium and place at 37°C and 5% CO2.\n      \n        The next day, wash the cells with ice-cold serum-free medium in the cold\n        room.\n      \n        Label cell-surface integrins by incubating the cells with primary\n        antibodies directed against integrin ectodomains and directly conjugated\n        with fluorophores, diluted in ice-cold serum-free medium. Here we used\n        antibody TS2/16 (conjugated to CY5) to label β1 and antibody 439-9B\n        (conjugated to FITC) to label β4 (both at 1 μg/mL). Labeling should\n        occur for 1 h on ice and in the cold room.\n      \nNote: It is imperative to keep the cells\n      cold to inhibit direct internalization of labeled integrins, which occurs\n      at higher temperatures.\n    \nNote: Use small coverslips and well sizes\n      as this will reduce the volume of medium -and thus the amount of antibody-",
    "required. Antibodies against integrins can be used in concentration ranges\n      0.5–10 μg/mL roughly. Determine the optimal concentration first\n      experimentally.\n    \nNote: The choice of antibody may greatly\n      affect results. Some antibodies react exclusively or preferentially with\n      either active or inactive integrins, and these have very different\n      kinetics of internalization, recycling, and degradation.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],35[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35] In addition, antibodies\n      can have functional effects on integrins (some of which related to the\n      stabilization or alteration of specific integrin conformations) and this\n      can affect integrin localization and behavior.34[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34],37[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib37],38[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib38]\n        Transfer 1 or 2 coverslips directly after labeling to a well containing\n        4% PFA.

Pulse-chase assay for assessment of integrin\n              internalization by confocal microscopy\n            \n              Confocal images showing the distribution of β1 integrins\n              (pseudocolored gray) and integrin α6β4 (green) at\n              the basal cell-surface (basal plane) and the lateral cell-surfaces\n              (mid plane) in human PA-JEB/β4 keratinocytes. Labeling of β1\n              integrins and α6β4 occurred using fluorescent antibodies directed\n              against integrin ectodomains at 4°C. Thereafter the cells were\n              either directly fixed (t = 0) or after allowing integrin\n              internalization for 15 min at 37°C (t = 15). Z-stacks were\n              acquired as described in\n              assessment of integrin endocytic trafficking by microscopy[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.8]. Note that integrin β4 is much less abundant at the lateral\n              cell-surfaces than β1 (mid plane, t = 0), and that there is also\n              much less β4 internalization compared to β1 after 15 min (mid\n              plane, t = 15). Bar, 40 μm.\n            \n        Place the other coverslips at 37°C in serum-free medium to allow\n        internalization of labeled cell-surface integrins.\n      \nNote: As growth factors induce rapid\n      recycling of internalized integrins, endocytosis is performed in the\n      absence of serum to stimulate accumulation and retention of integrins in\n      intracellular compartments.39[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib39]",
    "Take out coverslips at appropriate time-points after inducing\n        endocytosis (for instance 30 min) and transfer them to 4% PFA.\n      \nNote: It is important to first determine\n      the optimal time-points to observe robust integrin internalization for\n      each cell type/integrin/condition as different integrins have very\n      different kinetics of internalization and recycling,40[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib40],41[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib41],42[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib42] and in addition this may\n      depend on cell type. In the example here, we observe robust β1 integrin\n      internalization in 15 min in keratinocytes, while α6β4 hardly internalizes\n      in this time-frame (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]).\n    \n        After fixing the last coverslips, process further if desired (for\n        instance to label nuclei, adhesion complex components, or intracellular\n        compartments) as described in\n        staining of cell-matrix adhesions for immunofluorescence imaging[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1].\n      \n        Mount coverslips on microscope slides as described in\n        staining of cell-matrix adhesions for immunofluorescence imaging[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1].\n      \n        Image the coverslips by confocal microscopy as described in\n        confocal imaging of cell-matrix adhesions in fixed cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.2].\n      \nNote: Here we used a Leica DM8 SP8 set-up\n      with fully motorized Marzhauser stage, and a Leica 63×/1,40 oil HC plan\n      apochromatic CS objective (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]). Excitation was\n      at 405 nm for DAPI, 488 nm for integrin β4, and 633 nm for integrin β1,\n      and z-stacks consisting of 12 images were acquired starting at the basal\n      plane where adhesions were clearly visible, moving upward with step size\n      1 μm, performing bidirectional and sequential scanning at a speed of\n      200 Hz."
