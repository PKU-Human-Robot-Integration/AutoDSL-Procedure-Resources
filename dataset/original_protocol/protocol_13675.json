    "This protocol follows the guidelines of the institution's human research ethics committee. Ensure that the approval is obtained from the institutional review board (IRB) prior to the collection and utilization of biological specimens for research.\n1. Collection\nObtain urine sample in a sterile specimen cup. Decide the type of urine sample, as well as specific inclusion and exclusion criteria, based on the specific study design. For UTI studies, use either the clean-catch method or catheterization to avoid perineal contamination.\nTo obtain a clean-catch urine sample, instruct the participants to wipe down the periurethral area with a towelette, void a small amount into the toilet, and then urinate into the specimen cup.\nInstruct women to use their fingers to spread the labia and men to retract their foreskin (if applicable) prior to urination to avoid contamination.\nRecord the time of collection.\nCollect the relevant clinical data from each participant, as required by individual study design and research question.\nConsider performing a urinalysis or urine dipstick on each sample prior to processing and storage if this data is not reliably available from the electronic health record.\n2. Sample processing and storage\nProcess the samples immediately. If this is not possible, store the sample at 4 °C for up to 24 h.\nIf samples cannot be stored at 4 °C or need to be stored at 4 °C longer than 24 h, add 0.2 M boric acid or 10 mM NaN3 to the samples. Check to ensure such reagents are compatible with planned downstream applications.\nRecord the duration of time samples spent at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge the samples at 1000-1500 x g for 10-20 min. Centrifugation does not need to be at 4 °C.\nCollect the supernatant and aliquot it into separate microcentrifuge tubes.",
    "Label the tubes with multiple, clear, identifiers (such as the date and sample identification (ID)). Consider using computer-generated barcodes specifically designed for storage of biological samples at -80 °C. If unavailable, ensure that the pen used to label samples is water-resistant.\nLabel each freezer box such that each location has a specific code. For this, number each column with a different letter and each row with a number. This will allow for the creation of maps or other guides for easy sample location.\nFreeze the samples immediately at -80 °C. Record the time of freezing.\nThaw the samples in a 37 °C water bath on the day of measurement to minimize unnecessary storage at either room temperature or 4 °C.\nRecord the times and number of additional freeze-thaw cycles for each aliquot.\n3. Analysis\nWhen using commercially available ELISAs, follow the manufacturer's instructions.\nRun the samples in duplicate.\nIdentify the expected concentration of the protein of interest to ensure that the protein levels in the samples fall within the range of the kit. If the expected level of protein exceeds the upper standard, dilute the samples.\nAfter data is obtained from the plate reader (ELISA) or western blot, determine the concentration of each biomarker in the sample manually (not recommended) or using any software.\nAnalyze the results. Data analysis depends on the individual study design.\nConsider adjusting biomarker values to account for the urine concentration.\n\tNOTE: Traditionally, biomarker researchers have used urine creatinine as a method of normalization, especially in participants with normal renal function, to account for urine concentration. However, others report that normalization does not make a difference in the results4. To overcome this hurdle, some researchers report both normalized and non-normalized results.",
    "Recommend reporting ranges of times from collection to freezing, as well as the duration of time at 4 °C prior to processing in published manuscripts to allow for interpretation of results in the context of sample processing (Figure 1)\n4. Effect of various storage conditions on neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL).\nSpike fresh urine with 2 ng/mL of recombinant NGAL.\nAliquot the urine and subject it to different processing and storage conditions.\n\t\nCentrifuge the urine at 1000-1500 x g for 10-20 min. Centrifugation does not need to be at 4 °C. Store at different conditions (20 °C, 4 °C, -20 °C) for 24 h, 48 h, or 72 h.\nStore aliquot of the sample at -80 °C for comparison.\nAfter maintaining the samples in the different conditions as mentioned in step 4.2.1, measure the levels of NGAL in the samples using a commercially available ELISA kit which includes the controls as per the manufacturer's instructions.\nSubscription Required.
