    "Genomic DNA collection Add protease inhibitors fresh to Lysis Buffer and DNase Buffer to final concentrations: 5 µg/ml Aprotinin, 5 µg/ml Leupeptin, and 1 mM PMSF. Store buffers on ice.Collect human cell line from 1 x 10 cm plate (per experimental condition; ~5 x 106 cells/plate):Aspirate cell culture medium.Wash cells with 4 ml of ice cold 1x PBS solution and aspirate. Repeat once.Add 500 µl ice cold 1x PBS to the plate.Scrape cells with cell lifter and collect cell suspension into a microtube and keep on ice. Centrifuge cells for 5 s at 10,000 rpm (~9,400 x g) to pellet, then carefully remove and discard the 1x PBS supernatant with a pipette. Should be performed in a cold room.Resuspend cell pellet in 300 µl Lysis Buffer with protease inhibitors, and incubate on ice for 5 min. This step creates the chromatin/DNA to be analyzed below.Centrifuge lysate at 4,000 rpm (~1,500 x g) for 5 min at 4 °C.Carefully remove and discard supernatant with a pipette, and then resuspend DNA pellet in 300 µl DNase Buffer with protease inhibitors.Centrifuge lysate at 4,000 rpm (~1,500 x g) for 5 min at 4 °C.Resuspend DNA pellet in 300 µl DNase Buffer with protease inhibitors. No need to quantify the DNA. Aliquot 100 µl of the lysate to each of two separate microtubes (one for “DNase I”, one for “No DNase I”). Note here that equal amounts of chromatin/DNA for each condition are being assessed, and normalization to uncut input DNA (i.e., No DNase I) will be used in the Data Analysis below. Be accurate in your pipetting. The DNA is not viscous here because these are chromatin samples, where DNA is still on nucleosomes, etc.",
    "The Lysis Buffer does not disrupt the nuclear structure (on purpose) so that chromatin can be interrogated by the investigator using DNAse I in Procedure B of the protocol.DNase I reaction and substrate preparation (per experimental condition)Add 3 units (3 µl) DNase I Enzyme to one of the microtubes only (‘DNase I’), mix by tapping, and incubate both microtubes at room temperature for 7-8 min. Note: Incubation time is determined by trial and error (empirically) using distinct 10 cm plates of cells to test specific incubation durations for DNAse I exposure. Too short can limit nuclease effectiveness, and too long can tip activity beyond a linear range of detectable differences between experimental conditions. Chromatin will vary greatly for different loci, and DNase I will have different effectiveness at different sites, which makes it very difficult to pre-determine the DNase I duration for chromatin analysis with an optimization step on naked total input DNA. As an example, for the results obtained in Nepon-Sixt et al. (2019) (graphs in Figure 8c&d) we determined by empirical testing that 7 min of DNase I produced an acceptable partial digestion of chromatin that was not under-digested, nor exhaustive, to allow DNase I sensitivity differences to be measured for the Lamin B2 locus under the experimental conditions that were assessed. Your empirical testing would follow this same protocol to perform initial determinations of DNase I time durations needed for your particular chromatin site under investigation. Add 4.25 µl of 0.25 M EDTA pH 8.0 and 2.1 µl of 100 mM EGTA to each microtube (10 mM and 2 mM final concentrations, respectively), mix by tapping, and incubate in a 65 °C water bath for 10 min to stop reaction.Add 5.75 µl of 10% SDS (0.5% final concentration) to each tube, and mix.",
    "Lightly sonicate with Bioruptor 300 for an 8 min duration, 30 s on/30 s off.Add 20 µl of 2.5 M NaCl (~500 mM final concentration) to each microtube.Add 1 µl of 10 mg/ml RNase A (50 µg/ml final concentration) to each microtube, mix by pipetting, and incubate in a 37 °C water bath for 30 min.Add 3 µl of 10 mg/ml Proteinase K (250 µg/ml final concentration) to each microtube, mix by pipetting, and incubate in a 42 °C water bath overnight.Quick spin microtubes in centrifuge to remove condensation from the lid.Add ~350 µl of sterile deionized H2O (dH2O) to each tube, and purify DNA with phenol/chloroform extractions:Add 250 µl Tris-saturated phenol and 250 µl chloroform to each microtube, and invert 8-10 times to mix well.Centrifuge tubes at 12,000 rpm (~13,500 x g) for 5 min.Move aqueous layer (top layer) to new microtubes, respectively.Add 500 µl chloroform to each tube.Centrifuge tubes at 12,000 rpm (~13,500 x g) for 5 min.Move aqueous layer (top layer) to new microtubes, respectively.Fill tubes with ice cold 100% EtOH, shake, and incubate at -20 °C for 1 h.Centrifuge tubes at 12,000 rpm (~13,500 x g) at 4 °C for 25 min to pellet DNA.Discard supernatant and dry DNA pellets by inverting microtubes in a rack and incubating at room temperature for 10 min.Resuspend each DNA pellet in 50 µl TE Buffer to make DNA substrates. Again, no need to quantify DNA, but care must be taken in pipetting accuracy.qPCR analysis of DNA substratesCreate master mix for qPCR analysis containing the following (enough for quadruplicate 10 µl reactions per experimental condition, each with ‘DNase I’ and ‘No DNase I’ respectively):Sterile deionized H2O: 35 µl5x Colorless GoTaq Reaction Buffer:10 µl10 mM dNTPs:1 µlGoTaq Polymerase: 1 µlForward Primer (10 µM):1 µl (e.g.",
    ", sequence used for Lamin B2 ori accessibility analysis: 5′-GCTACACTAGCCAGTGACCTT-3′)Reverse Primer (10 µM): 1 µl (e.g., sequence for used for Lamin B2 ori accessibility analysis: 5′-GTTCTGCCTCTGAGTTTATTCCTG-3′)FAM-labeled Probe (10 µM): 0.5 µl (e.g., sequence used for Lamin B2 ori accessibility analysis: 5′-/56-FAM/-TTAGACATCCGCTTCATTAGGGCAGAGG-/3BHQ_1/-3′)Aliquot 49.5 µl master mixes into two microtubes each. Add 0.5 µl ‘DNase I’ DNA substrate to one tube, and 0.5 µl ‘No DNase I’ DNA substrate to the other, for each experimental condition, and mix well.Aliquot 10 µl of each reaction mix into 4 wells of a 96-well multiplate. Note: Try to avoid using the outer wells on the edge of the 96-well plate, if possible. In our experience use of the outer regions can lead to non-reproducible variability in results, likely due to temperature issues. Cover the 96-well plate with seal (Microseal ‘B’ Seals) and press to secure. Put the 96-well plate in CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection System and run the following program:95 °C for 10 min95 °C for 15 s 60 °C for 1 minRepeat steps b and c 40 x Analyze qPCR results with CFX Manager to obtain quantitation cycle (Ct) values using FAM."
