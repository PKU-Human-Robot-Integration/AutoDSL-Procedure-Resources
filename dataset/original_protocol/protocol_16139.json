    "The enzymatic core of a CRL is a binary protein complex containing a cullin core and a RING domain protein (RBX1 or RBX2). To co-express the recombinant CUL•RBX protein complex in E. coli, the coding sequences of the two protein components can be incorporated either into one plasmid or separately into two plasmids. Using CUL2 as an example, this protocol describes the purification of recombinant CUL2•RBX1 complex using tandem affinity chromatography. The expression plasmid was derived from a pGEX-4T-2 vector (Cytiva, cat. no. 28-9545-50), with the 6×HisRBX1 coding sequence inserted after the Tac promoter, a T7 promoter sequence inserted after 6×HisRBX1, and the 6×HisMsyB-StrepIICUL2 coding sequence inserted after the T7 promoter. The hyper-acidic bacterial protein MsyB was fused to the N-terminus of CUL2 to improve protein solubility. A TEV protease cleavage site was inserted between the 6×His tag and RBX1 and between MsyB and StrepIICUL2. Figure 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.401#cpz1401-fig-0002] summarizes the structure of the CUL2•RBX1 expression plasmid.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/53270c77-78e1-42ae-8b97-01f32d2d0ac0/cpz1401-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nExpression and purification of CUL2•RBX1.

Thaw a tube of BL21 (DE3) chemically competent E. coli cells on ice.\nUsually, 50 µl of competent cells is enough for one transformation.\n2. Add 0.1 to 10 ng CUL2•RBX1 expression plasmid to competent cells and mix by gently flicking tube several times.\nThe volume of plasmid should not exceed 10% of the total mixture volume.\n3. Incubate mixture on ice for 30 min.\n4. Heat shock at 42°C in a water bath for 45 s.\n5. Leave tube on ice for 5 min.\n6. Add 900 µl LB liquid medium into mixture.",
    "The LB medium can be at room temperature or prewarmed to 37°C.\n7. Place tube containing the cell mixture at 37°C in a microbiological incubator with vigorous shaking (200 to 250 rpm) for 60 min.\n8. Centrifuge 2 min at 300 × g in a microcentrifuge to pellet cells.\n9. Carefully discard supernatant and leave ∼100 µl supernatant in tube.\n10. Resuspend cell pellet and spread suspended cells onto an LB agar plate containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin (or other appropriate antibiotic).\nPre-warm the plate at 37°C before plating.\n11. Incubate plate at 37°C overnight (typically ∼16 hr).\n12. Check plate to make sure that a good amount of E. coli colonies show up on the plate.\nThe plate can be used immediately or stored for up to 2 weeks at 4°C before proceeding to the next step.\nExpress the recombinant protein in E. coli\n13. In a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask, add 50 ml LB liquid medium and 50 µl of 100 mg/ml ampicillin stock solution. Inoculate a few colonies from LB agar plate into the LB medium and grow culture overnight at 37°C with vigorous shaking (200 to 250 rpm).\nThis will yield a starter culture with high optical density.\n14. On the next day, add 1 ml of 100 mg/ml ampicillin stock solution into 1 L LB liquid medium in each of six 2.8-L Fernbach culture flasks and mix well by gently swirling for a few seconds.\nIn this protocol, six of these culture flasks with medium are prepared, but it can be scaled up or down.\nIf the medium is sterilized by autoclaving, then the flasks should be prepared ahead of time to allow the sterilized medium to cool down and reach room temperature.",
    "15. Add overnight starter culture from step 13 into each 2.8-L culture flask to dilute the culture 200 times (5 ml culture per 1 L medium). Grow at 37°C with vigorous shaking (200 to 250 rpm).\n16. Check optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of the culture periodically using a cell density meter to ensure that the OD600 does not go over 1.0.\nMeasure the OD600 for the first time 2 hr after starting the culture. When the reading is above 0.7, check the OD600 every 20 to 30 min.\n17. When the OD600 is close to 1.0, stop shaker and cool down culture by transferring the flasks to a cold room. Then, set shaker to 16°C and allow it to cool.\n18. After the culture and the shaker are cooled down, add 0.8 M IPTG stock solution to each flask to 0.2 mM to induce expression of the recombinant protein.\nThe final concentration of IPTG can be modified for optimal protein yield (usually 0.1 to 1 mM).\n19. Incubate culture overnight at 16°C with vigorous shaking (200 to 250 rpm).\nThe culture temperature can be adjusted, but lower temperature usually helps with protein folding and solubility.\n20. On the next day, transfer culture into 1000-ml centrifuge bottles and harvest E. coli cells by centrifugation for 30 min at 3000 × g using a refrigerated floor centrifuge. Discard supernatant and resuspend cells in PBS.\nThe volume of PBS added should be enough to resuspend the cells and to fit the cell suspension into a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube (see the next step). Usually, 25 to 30 ml PBS is used for cells from 3 L culture and subsequently transferred to one conical tube.",
    "21. Transfer resuspended cells into 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge 10 min at 3000 × g and discard supernatant.\nTwo tubes are used for 6 L culture.\nThe pellets can be either used immediately for the next step or frozen and stored at –80°C before proceeding to the next step.\nExtract CUL2•RBX1 from E. coli cells using Ni2+ affinity chromatography\n22. Add cold Ni-NTA lysis buffer to tubes containing bacteria cell pellets.\nAdd 25 ml buffer per pellet collected from 3 L culture.\n23. Sonicate pellets briefly to free the pellets from the bottom of the tubes.\n24. Transfer pellets and lysis buffer from the two tubes into the same plastic beaker incubated in an ice-water bath.\n25. Sonicate pellets in the beaker to lyse the cells thoroughly.\nThe sonication conditions should be configured according to the manual for the specific sonicator. Suggested parameters are 0.5\" flat tip with 50% amplitude and 1-s on time and 1-s off time for a total duration of 3 min. Run the program three times with a 5-min break between each run.\nSonication generates heat, so it is necessary to keep the plastic beaker in the ice-water bath with plenty of ice during this entire process.\nCAUTION: Use safety earmuffs when the sonicator is on for hearing protection.\n26. Transfer equal volumes of cell lysate into two high-speed centrifuge tubes. Centrifuge 30 min at 25,000 × g, 4°C, in a refrigerated high-speed centrifuge.\nThe two tubes containing cell lysate must be carefully balanced before centrifugation. A balance can be used to determine the weight of each tube, and Ni-NTA lysis buffer can be added to the tube with lower weight to match its weight to that of the other tube.",
    "27. During the centrifugation period (step 26), prepare Ni-NTA agarose beads for protein extraction by first loading Ni-NTA agarose bead slurry into two 15-ml conical centrifuge tubes.\nUse 0.75 ml beads per liter of culture.\n28. Centrifuge 2 min at 500 × g, 4°C, in a refrigerated benchtop centrifuge.\n29. Discard supernatant and resuspend beads in two bed volumes of cold Ni-NTA lysis buffer.\n30. Repeat steps 27 to 29 two more times. Then, transfer equal volumes of agarose bead slurry into two 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes.\n31. After the centrifugation in step 26 is done, transfer supernatant into the tubes containing the Ni-NTA beads (prepared in step 30).\n32. Incubate tubes at 4°C for ≥2 hr with mild agitation on a refrigerated incubator shaker.\n33. Centrifuge as in step 28 and discard supernatant.\n34. Resuspend beads with two bed volumes of Ni-NTA wash buffer.\n35. Repeat steps 33 to 34 two more times to remove excess cell lysate from beads.\n36. Set up an empty gravity flow column on a clamp stand and wash column with 10 ml Ni-NTA wash buffer.\n37. Transfer all the bead slurry (from step 35) into the column. Use a two-way stopcock on bottom of the column to control the flow.\n38. Wait for beads to settle and then let buffer flow out of the column.\n39. Close stopcock and resuspend beads in two bed volumes of Ni-NTA elution buffer. Incubate for 10 min.\n40. Open stopcock and collect eluate in a 50-ml conical centrifuge tube incubated on ice.\n41. Repeat steps 39 and 40 three to four more times. Use a Bradford protein assay kit to determine if a fraction of the eluate contains a detectable amount of protein that is worth collecting.",
    "42. Combine eluate from all collected fractions and estimate total amount (mg) of protein via the Bradford assay.\n43. Mix 30 µl eluate with 10 µl of 4× SDS sample buffer. Store up to 6 months at –20°C.\n44. Add TEV protease to eluate to remove the MsyB protein and the 6×His tag. Mix by gently inverting tube several times and incubate at 4°C overnight.\nFor 1 mg total protein, 20 µg TEV is added.\n45. On the next day, mix 9 µl eluate with 3 µl of 4× SDS sample buffer. Analyze this sample together with the sample from step 43 using SDS-PAGE (see Current Protocols article; Gallagher, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.401#cpz1401-bib-0006]) to assess the progress of the TEV cleavage. If the cleavage is not complete, add more TEV protease and incubate longer.\nRemoval of the MsyB fusion protein results in a loss of ∼20 kDa in protein size.",

    "14. Concentrate protein sample from step 9 to ∼500 μl using a centrifugal filter unit (50-kDa cutoff) by centrifuging at 5000 × g, 4°C, and checking the sample every 5 min. Filter protein sample through a 0.22-μm centrifugal filter.\nThis step should be done immediately before the next step.\nIf the protein solution looks cloudy, then centrifuge the sample in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube to pellet the precipitate first and then filter the supernatant.\n15. Load filtered protein sample into the sample loop using a 1-ml syringe with a needle. To avoid introducing air into the sample loop, insert syringe needle into the injection port in “inject” mode and then switch to “manual load” mode and load protein solution into the sample loop.\n16. Run elution program at 0.4 ml/min for 30 ml. Collect eluate as 300-μl fractions in the fraction collector.\n17. Analyze fractions under the UV peak(s) as in step 9. Pay close attention to fractions with expected retention volume (12 to 14 ml for CUL2•RBX1). Combine fractions containing the target protein and low levels of contaminants.\n18. Using a UV spectrophotometer, determine concentration of the collected protein through obtaining the UV absorbance (at 280 nm) of the protein solution and the molar extinction coefficient (Ɛ) for the target protein (see Current Protocols article; Olson, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.401#cpz1401-bib-0016]).\nAlternatively, the protein concentration can be measured by the Bradford assay.\n19.

    "For reactions with unneddylated CUL2 and mock control, NEDD8 or CUL2•RBX1 can be respectively omitted.\n2. Incubate reaction mixture at room temperature for 1 hr.\nThis reaction condition should drive almost all CUL2 to neddylated CUL2 (CUL2N8). It can be scaled up to generate a large amount of CUL2N8•RBX1, which can be further purified using StrepII-tag affinity chromatography (see Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.401#cpz1401-prot-0002]).\nEvaluate the effect of cullin neddylation on substrate ubiquitination in vitro\n3.

    "A different reaction temperature can be used to adjust the rate of substrate ubiquitination.\nTable 3.\n                Composition of the Ubiquitination Reaction Mixture\ntable:\n﻿Volume,Component\n60 μl,CUL2N8•RBX1 or CUL2•RBX1 or mock control (step 2)\n30 μl,Substrate + substrate receptor mixture (step 3)\n30 μl,Ub mixture (step 4)\nTable 4.\n                Final Concentrations of All Components in the Ubiquitination Reaction\ntable:\n﻿Amount,Component\n1×,Reaction buffer\n2 mM,DTT\n2 mM,ATP\n0.5 μM,Ub E1\n0.2 μM,Ub E2 (Cdc34)\n30 μM,Ub\n0.1 μM,CUL2N8•RBX1 (or CUL2•RBX1 or mock control)\n0.1 μM,VHL•EloB•EloC\n0.1 μM,Substrate\n6. At each desired time point after the start of the reaction, withdraw 18 μl reaction mixture and mix with 6 μl of 4× SDS sample buffer to stop reaction. When samples from all time points have been collected, incubate them at 100°C for 5 min in a heat block.\nFor the first experiment, we recommend trying a wide range of time points, such as 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. Based on the results from the first trial, time points should be adjusted in follow-up experiments, with more frequent time points in the fast-changing phase and less frequent ones in the slow-changing phase.\n7. Run all samples on an SDS-PAGE gel. Then, detect unmodified and ubiquitinated substrates by western blot (see Current Protocols article; Gallagher, Winston, Fuller, & Hurrell, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.401#cpz1401-bib-0007]) with anti-FLAG antibody, anti-VHL antibody, and anti-CUL2 antibody.\nGradient SDS-PAGE gels (precast 4% to 20% Tris-glycine gradient gels, Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. XP04205BOX) are recommended for better separation of CUL2N8 vs. CUL2 and unmodified vs. ubiquitinated substrates.",
    "If the substrate contains an epitope tag (e.g., FLAG tag), then an antibody for the epitope tag is recommended for western blot. When antibodies against the substrate itself need to be used, then make sure that the region of the substrate protein recognized by the antibody is not ubiquitinated. As a loading control, VHL (or the applicable substrate receptor protein) on the same gel as in step 7 should be analyzed by western blot. In addition, CUL2 should be analyzed to assess the level of cullin neddylation.\nIf the substrate is fluorescently labeled, then image the SDS-PAGE gel on a fluorescent scanner (instead of western blot).\n8. Quantify intensity of the unmodified substrate bands from all time points using ImageJ or equivalent software (Davarinejad, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.401#cpz1401-bib-0003]). Also quantify intensity of the VHL (loading control) bands for normalization purposes.\n9. Fit normalized intensity of the unmodified substrate bands with a one-phase exponential decay model.\nA detailed guide on curve fitting has been provided previously (Motulsky & Christopoulos, 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.401#cpz1401-bib-0015])."
