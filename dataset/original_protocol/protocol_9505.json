    "Before beginning the data collection, it is important to receive all the necessary ethical research approval for human participants. This should be done through the appropriate review boards and/or human participants review committees.\nThis protocol was approved and certified by the ethics board from HEC Montréal for the Tech3Lab research facility.\n1. Preparation of the visual stimulus\nCreate the experimental template for the visual stimulus with a visual experiment presentation software, such as E-prime. Create one for the practice trial (six trials) and one for the experimental conditions (22 trials).\nOpen the E-prime software and go to the structure window, where the logic of the experiment can be created.\n\t\nDouble click on SessionProc (the timeline for sequencing the order of appearance of the E-objects).\nDrag the TextDisplay object from the toolbox into the SessionProc line.\n\t\t\nDouble click the TextDisplay object that has been inserted into the SessionProc and write the study instructions: “When you hear the auditory cue, please raise your head and indicate aloud which direction the walker is going, either towards your left or towards your right. The experiment will begin shortly.”\nClick on the Property Pages icon on the top of the TextDisplay window. Click on the Common tab and change the Name box setting to instructions. Click on the Duration drop down menu and select Infinite. Click on the Duration/Input tab and choose Add, select Keyboard and press OK. Click on OK again to exit the Property Pages. This ensures that the instructions stay on the screen until you press to start the experiment.",
    "In SessionProc, now drag and drop a List object into the SessionProc line (place it after the instructions). Double click on the List object. In the Procedure column write “Left-Trial”, press Enter and click YES to the pop-up window asking to create a new procedure. When the next pop-up window asks to make this the default value click NO.\nDouble click the List object in the SessionProc line. Click on the green button named Add Attribute. Name the attribute as: correct response. Click OK.\nClick on the blank space in the column correct response and write L (this is to signal that this list object if for the walker going towards the left).\nReturn to SessionProc and click on the new object that was created called Left-Trial.\nGo to the SessionProc and double click the Left-Trial object.\n\t\t\nDrag and drop the InLine object into the Left-Trial line and rename it.\n\t\t\t\nSelectITI. Double click on the InLine object and write the following code:\n\t\t\t\tDim nRandom As Integer\n\t\t\t\tnRandom = Random (16500, 17500)\n\t\t\t\tc.SetAttrib “ITIDur”, nRandom\nThe code presents the walker stimulus at intervals of time between 16,500 ms and 17,500 ms.\nDouble click Left-Trial. Drag and drop a Slide object into the Left-Trial line. Rename it Waiting, this object will be a blank screen that appears between the visual stimuli for the amount of time determined by the code in step 1.2.7.\nDouble click on the Slide object.\n\t\t\nClick on the Sub-Object called SlideText and click somewhere in the slide to place the object there.\nRemove the existing text from that image.\nClick Sub-Object Property Pages.\nIn the Frame tab set both the width and height to 100%. Click OK.\nClick the Property Pages and go to the Duration/Input tab. Type in duration the following value: [ITIDur].",
    "Double click Left-Trial and drag and drop a SoundOut object onto the Left-Trial line.\n\t\t\nDouble click the SoundOut object.\nUnder Filename select the appropriate sound cue file directory.\nChange the Buffer size to 1,000 ms.\nClick OK.\nGo back to Left-Trial and drag and drop a Slide object into the Left-Trial line and rename it Walker Left.\n\t\t\nDouble click this new object.\nAdd a SlideMovie sub-object by clicking the sub-object and then clicking the slide.\nClick Sub-Object Property Pages and under Filename select the directory of the video file of the left walker.\nSet Stop After Mode to OffsetTime.\nClick on Stretch and chose YES.\nSet End Movie Action to Terminate.\nClick on the Frame tab and set the width and the height to 100%.\nFor the Position, set both X and Y position to 50%.\nFinally, set the Border Colour to white.\nClick OK.\nClick on the Property Pages of the Slide object.\n\t\t\t\nClick on the Duration/Input tab.\nSet the Duration to 4,000. Set PreRelease to 500.\nClick OK.\nRepeat this whole procedure (i.e., from steps 1.2.3–1.2.9) for the right trial. Name the procedure Right-Trial. When following the procedure, change only the correct response (i.e., to R instead or L) and the video file. Use the video file directory for the right walker.\nDouble click the SessionProc.\n\t\nDrag and drop and Slide object to the SessionProc line\nDouble click this object and add a SlideText Sub-Object.\nWrite Pause as the text.\nAgain, go into the Sub-Object Property Pages and in the Frame tab make the width and height 100%. Make the Position for X and Y 50%.\nClick OK.\nDouble click on the List object that was already created.\n\t\nClick on the Property Pages of the List object.",
    "In the Selection tab set the Order to Random and click OK.\nIn the Weight column insert the following numbers:\n\t\t\nPractice: enter the number 3 in both the Left-Trial row and the Right-Trial row.\nExperiment: enter the number 11 in both the Left-Trial row and the Right-Trial row.\nAt the top of the window click the icon Generate to create an executable script file. Save it to the desktop for easy access. This is the file that will be run during the experiment.\n\t\nSave the practice trial as “Practice” and the experimental trials as “Experiment”.\nTest the script created by clicking on the Run icon.\nIn the E-studio folder, an E-run file will be created. Both the files created (one for the practice trial and one for the experimental trials) can be placed in a folder on the computer’s desktop. To run the visual experiment, simply click on the appropriate icon.\nOnce the visual stimulus’ experimental templates are created attempt to display them with the projector.\n\t\nWith the projector settings, modify the height of the walker figure and make sure that it is centered directly in front of where the participant would be standing on the treadmill.\nWith a measuring tape, measure the height of the walker directly on the projector screen. Calculate the distance between the screen and the eyes of a person standing on the treadmill in order for the stimulus to cover 25° of visual angle, and move the treadmill accordingly. To calculate the necessary distances, one may use the following website: http://elvers.us/perception/visualAngle/\n2. Setup of the laboratory environment\nTurn on the four recording computers, the EEG amplifier, the projector, the treadmill, the speakers, and the smartphone.\nSet up the recording equipment.",
    "Open the synchronization software with the specific subroutine created for the study with markers at 10 s.\n\t\t\nThe synchronization software sends a pulse that appears in the form of a marker and light pulse in the EEG and video recordings every 10 s.\nTurn on the video recording software. The cameras should automatically turn on as well. If not, manually turn them on.\nOpen and set up the EEG recording software for the participant.\nOpen the folder containing the visual stimulus executable script file made with the visual experiment presentation software.\nPrepare the EEG setup and materials according to the procedures suggested by the manufacturers.\nDelete the conversation from the previous participant from the smartphone.\nPlace a new bottle of water next to the participant’s resting chair.\n3. Participant preparation\nWelcome the participant into room 1 and tell them briefly about the study duration and the compensation.\nAsk participants to remove their jewelry (e.g., earrings, piercings, necklaces), glasses, smartphone, and any content in their pockets, place these in a bin, and put it in a locker.\nAsk participants to get rid of any chewing gum they might be eating and ensure that they have eaten prior to beginning the experiment.\nEnsure that the participant is wearing comfortable walking shoes and have them double knot their shoelaces to guarantee the participant’s safety during the experiment.\nHave the participant read and sign the consent form.\n\t\nRead the following script and have the participant sit so they can read and sign the consent form:\n\t\t“Here is a consent form stating that you agree to participate in this study. Read it carefully and sign it. Do not hesitate if you have any questions.”\nTake the participant to the designated participant preparation room, room 3, where the EEG cap is to be set up.",
    "Read the prepared script that explains the flow of the experimental process:\n\t​\"You may notice that every so often I might read a text. This is done to ensure that all participants receive identical instructions. In this study, we are interested in how people interact with a stimulus in front of them while sending text messages and walking at a moderate speed. For about 40 minutes, you will text [name of research assistant] that you met earlier with this smartphone [show the smartphone]. While you are texting you will hear a sound from time to time. This sound will be followed by an image of a walking character. Your task is to raise your head to the screen here [point to the screen] and to indicate aloud whether the character is walking towards your right OR your left. You will not be asked to do anything else. I will write down your answers. Note that in all blocks there are two choices for an answer (right and left), so it is impossible that there will, for example, only left or right as a single choice. The direction the character comes from is totally random. After dictating your answer, you simply continue to text [name of research assistant]. It is important not to turn around when you answer or if you want to talk to me because you could be destabilized and fall. Keep your head forward. I will be behind this mirror here [point to the glass] throughout the duration of the experiment. Do you have any questions?\"\nMeasure the participant’s head circumference for the EEG electrode cap. For this experiment an EEG actiCap with 32 preamplified electrodes was used.",
    "Choose the appropriate size EEG cap, place it on a foam head for support, and place all the electrodes in their proper location.\nRemeasure the participant’s head circumference to determine the starting point of the cap by using the 10-20 reference system.\nPlace the cap on the participant’s head starting from the front and hold it in position while pulling it backwards. Make sure the cap is placed properly.\nConnect the EEG cap’s cables to the EEG control box.\nShow the gel applicator to the participant so they can see that it is not sharp and allow them to touch it if they so desire. Read the following script:\n\t\t“Here is the applicator and the tip that I will use to put the gel on the EEG cap that you have on your head. You can touch it; it does not hurt. The tip is just short enough that it never touches your head.”\nTurn on the EEG electrode box so that all the electrode lights turn red.\nActivate the electrodes by first moving the hair out of the way and then applying the gel to each electrode: start with the ground electrode and then the reference electrode. Once these two electrodes turn green add the remaining electrodes.\nPlace the gel until all the electrode sensors turn green.\nMeasure the impedance on the control box.\nDisconnect the cables from the control box and connect them to the move adapter (i.e., the adapter kit that wirelessly transmits the data back to the control box).\nPlace the adapter kit in a fanny pack and ask the participant to attach it around their waist, with the cables and the adapter kit placed towards the participant’s back.\nGo back to the computer room (room 4) and check the impedance of each electrode.",
    "Verify that the data quality is satisfactory by visually inspecting the signal on the EEG software’s monitor screen. If necessary, fix the problematic electrodes.\nTake the participant into the experimental room (i.e., room 2).\nHave the participant stand on the treadmill and attach the treadmill safety key to the participant.\nTurn on the treadmill to a speed of 0.8 mph and have the participant walk for 2 min so they get familiarized with the speed. During these 2 min, remind the participant about the instructions:\n\t“For about 40 minutes, you will text [name of research assistant] with a smartphone. While you are texting, you will hear a sound from time to time. This sound will be followed by an image of a walking character. Your task is to raise your head to the screen at that time and indicate aloud, in your opinion, whether the character is walking towards your right or your left. You will not be asked to do anything else. I will write down your answers. After stating your answer, you simply continue to text [name of research assistant]. It is important to always give an answer. If you are not sure, tell us your best guess. Do not turn around when you give your answer or if you want to talk to me because you could be destabilized and fall. Keep your head forward. There are four parts to the experiment, two where you text [name of research assistant] while walking, and two where you are just walking. Each part lasts about 12 minutes and there is a break of 2 minutes between each part. Do you have any questions?”\n4. Practice trial\nGive the participant the smartphone.\nTell the participant that they will be doing a practice trial.",
    "Click on the stimulus’ executable script file for the Practice trials. Enter the participant number and begin the trial.\nHave the participant practice responding to the visual stimuli while partaking in a texting conversation with the research assistant. This practice session will last 3 min.\nOnce the session begins, follow the texting conversation script created for the study.\nWrite down the participant's answer to each stimulus appearance on a spreadsheet template.\nAfter the 3 min, have the participant sit on a chair and drink some water. During this time adjust the treadmill speed to 0.4 mph.\nRemind the participant of the study instructions.\n5. Data collection\nSetup\n\t\nGo to the workflow sheet to choose the condition order for the current participant. Two orders are possible: In order A, trials 1 and 3 use the texting condition, while trials 2 and 4 use the control condition. In order B, trials 1 and 3 use the control conditions and trials 2 and 4 use the texting conditions. During each trial the visual stimulus appears 22 times.\nMake sure that all the recording software is ready to be started in synchrony.\nTurn on all the recording software (e.g., EEG, video)\nHave the participant get back on the treadmill and slowly increase the speed back to 0.8 mph.\nTurn on the visual stimulus program and start running it.\nRead the trial’s instructions depending on the experimental condition.\n\t\t\nRun the stimulus’ executable script file for the Experiment trials. Enter the participant number and the code chosen for the specific conditions. Begin the trial.\nControl condition\nEnsure that the smartphone is out of the participant’s field of vision during this task.\nInstruct the participant to simply walk on the treadmill and respond to the visual stimulus every time it appears by answering \"left\" or \"right\":",
