Workflow schematic of the sucrose polysome gradient protocol from multiple cell types. This illustrates the overall steps of the procedure to analyze RNA distribution across a polysome gradient.STAGE 1: Lysate PreparationPART 1A. Growth and harvesting of cellsYeast Day 0Inoculate cells from plate into 50 ml YPD in a 250 ml baffled flask.Grow overnight to saturation.Day 1Dilute overnight culture into 400 ml YPD at an OD600 of 0.05 in a 2 L baffled flask. Note: If growing multiple cultures, stagger culture growth slightly (30 min difference between first and last cultures is sufficient).When culture reaches an OD600 of 0.5-0.6, harvest cells by rapid filtration:1) Pour YPD on filter prior to pouring culture.2) Pour entire culture down the side of the filtration vessel, taking care to avoid pouring foam that will collect on top of the filter.3) As the last liquid pours through, quickly remove the clamp and top of the filter unit, scrape cells from the filter quickly but gently using a cell lifter, and submerge into conical containing liquid nitrogen. The total time between the last liquid flowing through the filter and the cells being submerged in liquid nitrogen should not exceed 5 sec.Note: Cell scraper should be pre-chilled in liquid nitrogen.Place conical with pellet in a -80 °C freezer and allow liquid nitrogen to boil off.Note: Leave cap loosely tightened.",

    "6) Re-suspend the cell powder in liquid nitrogen and pour back into the original conical tube.Place the conical tube in a -80 °C freezer and allow liquid nitrogen to boil off.Note: Leave cap loosely tightened.Pause pointProceed to Stage 2A PART 1B: Sample preparation (Day 2)Note: ALL following steps are done on an ice block or in a 4 °C cold room.Yeast procedure Thaw grinded powder on ice for 5 min.Prematurely adding lysis buffer can cause it to freeze.In the meantime, pre-label four siliconized microcentrifuge tubes per sample:Re-suspended powderClarified undiluted lysateClarified diluted lysateAliquoted lysate (multiple tubes)Note: You will also need three 0.6 ml tubes per sample containing 90 μl ddH2O. Add 1 ml lysis buffer to the cell powder in each conical.Swirl each tube to lightly mix, then fully re-suspend by pipetting up and down using a P1000.Transfer entire tube contents to pre-labeled ‘re-suspended’ 1.7 ml tubes.Spin for 10 min at 1,300 x g at 4 °C.Transfer clarified lysate (~800 μl) into ‘clarified undiluted’ labeled 1.7 ml tubes. Clarified lysate should have a translucent appearance with a white/yellow hue.Transfer 10 μl into 90 μl water to spec on NanoDrop for RNA concentration, which serves as a proxy for total lysate concentration.Notes:Triton X-100 interferes with reading so dilution is needed.Blank will have 10 μl lysis buffer + 90 μl ddH2O. Dilute all lysates to 25 OD260 U/ml (1 μg/μl RNA) with lysis buffer. Spec the diluted lysate to ensure that all samples are within ~5% of each other.Add exogenous uncapped Luciferase RNA (Promega) to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml.Aliquot 150 μl into 1.7 ml tubes. Store lysates not immediately needed for experiment at -80 °C.Proceed to Stage 2B.Mammalian cells procedure Thaw cell pellet on ice.Resuspend cell pellet in 100 μl lysis buffer per 106 cells.Transfer lysate to a 1.",
    "7 ml tube.Incubate for 10 min on ice, mix by pipetting up and down.Note: Optimal lysis time and detergent concentration may vary depending on the cell type. Check cell lysis under a microscope with phase contrast at different times during lysis. Triton can be substituted by other detergents such as NP-40 or mechanical lysis using a dounce homogenizer.Centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C at 12,000 x g.Transfer clarified lysate into a ‘clarified undiluted’ labeled 1.7 ml tube. Dilute 10 μl of lysate into 90 μl water to spec on NanoDrop for RNA concentration, which serves as a proxy for total lysate concentration (see Note 8).Dilute all samples to the same concentration by adding an appropriate amount of lysis buffer.Note: We recommend diluting to ~20-100 μg/ml. Adjust concentrations and measure by spec to ensure all samples are within 5% of each other.Spike in exogenous uncapped Luciferase RNA to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml. Aliquot 200-500 μl into 1.7 ml tubes and store the remaining lysate (input) at -80 °C. Proceed to stage 2B. Tissue procedure Weigh 50 mg (one scoop) of frozen powder into LN2 chilled 5 ml Eppendorf tubes.Act quickly to avoid tube warming up.Dip tubes into LN2 and shake to separate powder frequently (main 50 ml conical).Let to ‘thaw’ to 4 °C in ice before adding lysis buffer (LB).Add 50-100 μl of lysis buffer per mg of powder.Pipette up and down to mix, vortex vigorously, and let sit on ice.Allow Triton X-100 to lyse lipids for 5-10 min after adding LB before spinning.Vortex again.Spin 750 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Separate supernatant into a new tube. Note: Whole tissue samples: Lipid-rich samples must be carefully prepared to avoid lipid contamination.",
    "As such, we recommend taking the middle 75% of the clarified lysate after centrifugation to avoid disturbing the top lipid layer or bottom insoluble material.Spin 12,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Separate supernatant into a new tube.Note: Take 75% liquid from the middle.Transfer 10 μl of supernatant into 90 μl water to spec on NanoDrop for RNA concentration, which serves as a proxy for total lysate concentration (see Note 8).Dilute all samples to 100 ng/μl RNA in lysis buffer containing Heparin.Add exogenous uncapped Luciferase RNA (Promega) to a final concentration of 100 ng/ml, then vortex to mix.Aliquot 250 μl into 1.7 ml tubes and store the remaining lysate (input) at -80 °C. Proceed to Stage 2B.STAGE 2: Sucrose Gradient Fractionation (Day 2)PART 2A. Gradient preparationThe set up should be done at room temperature and prior to the second step of lysate preparation. While gradients are cooling to 4 °C, prepare and clarify the lysates. Prepare sucrose solutionsAliquot 40 ml of pre-filtered sucrose solutions (stored at 4 °C, see Recipes section) into a conical tube, and let warm to room temperature.Add DTT, cycloheximide, and Superase-IN to sucrose solutions, then mix by gentle rotation.Prepare lysis buffer and put on ice to cool to 4 °C.Mark Polyclear centrifuge tubes using the SW41 Ti marker block by drawing a line on each tube at the top marker block line.Using a stripette, fill centrifuge tubes with 10% sucrose solution (see Recipes) up to ~2 mm above the marked line.Fill up a 50 ml syringe with the 50% sucrose solution (see Recipes) slowly (to avoid bubbles). Attach the cannula and expel any air by holding the syringe vertically (with the cannula pointing up).",
    "Holding the tube such that the marked line is at eye level, quickly and vertically insert the cannula into the bottom of the tube (avoiding the 50% sucrose solution leaking into the 10% solution).Slowly expel the 50% sucrose solution while maintaining the bottom of the cannula ~5 mm below the meniscus. When the meniscus of the interphase layer reaches the marked line, stop expelling and quickly pull out the cannula.Cap each tube (taking care to avoid any air pockets).Using a P1000, pipette out any residual sucrose that was pushed out through the cap’s hole.Place tubes into the gradient maker tube holder (that has been pre-leveled using the manufacturer-supplied level).Using the gradient maker station software, run the ‘14S short 10-50%’ program (see Note 1 for program information).Transfer the tubes to the cold room (but do not remove caps yet) while you prepare the lysates.At this point, turn on the ultra-centrifuge to allow it to pre-cool to 4 °C.PART 2B. UltracentrifugationGently remove caps from 10-50% sucrose gradients. Slide sucrose-gradient tubes into rotor buckets.Remove (X + 100) μl from the top of each gradient, where X is the amount of lysate you will load (typically 100 μl but up to 600 μl is acceptable).Note: The downstream RNA analysis steps of this protocol work best for sucrose gradients performed using < 100 μg of lysate (based on A260 units). For higher loading of lysates some scaling up and optimization of the downstream steps of the protocol may be required.Slowly layer 100-600 μl of lysate on top of the gradient. The lysate should form a visible and neat layer. Note: Save at least 10 μl of lysate as the ‘Input’ fraction for downstream qRT-PCR analysis.",
    "Weigh each gradient tube in a balance and carefully adjust the weight of each tube, if needed, by adding lysis buffer. Equilibrate the bucket pairs facing each other on the rotor: 1-4, 2-5 and 3-6. Cap the buckets.Attach buckets to the SW41 Ti rotor.Gently lower the rotor into the centrifuge, and lightly spin the rotor by hand to ensure that all buckets are connected properly.Enter centrifugation settings:Vacuum–ONTemp–4 °CSpeed–36,000 rpm (160,000 x g)Time–2.5 h Acceleration–1De-acceleration–7Start the centrifuge and ensure that it reaches the desired speed. The centrifuge may pause acceleration at 3,000 rpm until the vacuum is fully engaged.Note: On an SW41 Ti rotor, 36,000 rpm corresponds to 160,000 x g at rav. If you are using a different rotor, please refer to the manual to use the correct speed. PART 2C. FractionationRead and follow manufacturer’s instructions. We recommend contacting the local Biocomp representative for an advanced tutorial. During the spin, turn on the Bio-Rad Econo UV monitor to warm up and label and chill screw-cap tubes.Notes:Allow the Bio-Rad Econo UV Monitor to warm up for at least 2 h before setting the zero.During centrifugation: Pre-label 16 screw cap tubes (USA Scientific) per gradient, cover with cling film or Parafilm to prevent dust/RNase contamination and store in at 4 °C. Turn on the Gilson fraction collector, the Biocomp gradient station, the computer and open ‘Gradient Profiler V2’ software.Set the zero UV reading with clean water Bio-Rad Econo UV monitor. Ensure that UV readout is stable, not fluctuating.Remove rotor from centrifuge, place rotor tubes on rack, and place in cold room.Note: Do not remove screw cap until needed for fractionation.",
    "Fractionate gradients into 2 ml screw-cap tubes using the following settings:Note: If at any point the Econo-UV monitor light turns red, pull up the piston, release the air valve, and repeat the zeroing with water.table:",
