    "At the cessation of the study, cohorts of mice enter into the end protocols depicted in Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-fig-0001].

    "This simple urine collection procedure described below can be completed during aging to monitor kidney disease every 1-2 weeks, recommended after 20 weeks age, and at 2-5 days before the day for euthanizing the cohort, to allow second attempts at collection from diseased mice. The collection procedure described here is adapted from Kurien, Everds, & Scofield (2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0026]).\n1. Prepare a clean surface and spray down with 70% ethanol, or use a tabletop bench protector with the polyethylene side up. Ensure the surface is dry before commencing.\n2. To collect urine, apply gentle trans-abdominal pressure over the mouse's bladder to overcome normal urethral pressure.\n3. Collect the urine on the tabletop bench protector using a pipette and transfer to a clean 1.7-ml microcentrifuge tube. Alternatively, the urine can be collected directly into the microcentrifuge tube. Place the urine on ice until analysis to avoid sample degradation.\n4. To complete a rapid estimation of proteinuria, pipette 20 µl of urine onto an Albustix Protein Urinalysis Test Strip. Read and tabulate the result.\n5. Store the remaining urine at −80°C for further assays.\nA more accurate analysis of protein content can be completed by quantifying albumin in urine using ELISA (Abcam), with normalization to urinary creatinine as per manufacturer's protocols (Cayman Chemical).\nSedation of mice for procedures\nIf perfusion is being performed, it is recommended that sedation be completed using a reagent such as isoflurane or Avertin, depending on authorization.\n6a. Sedation with isoflurane:\n         \nAnesthetize mice with isoflurane by inhalation in a closed system in a fume hood (Donovan & Brown, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0015]).\nMonitor the mouse for respiratory rate and depth. Once non-responsive to toe pinching, proceed to retro-orbital bleeding.\n6b. Sedation with Avertin:\n         \nWeigh mice.",
    "Inject 0.1 ml/10 g body weight of prepared Avertin into the peritoneal cavity (see Donovan & Brown, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0016], for injection technique) using a 1-ml insulin syringe.\nWait for 5-10 min until the mouse is sedated, i.e., when it is non-responsive to toe pinching, before taking blood samples\nRetro-orbital bleeding\nThe volumes indicated in this protocol are for pre-euthanasia. Recommended times pre-disease are at 6-8 weeks old, and then at 4 months to assess the onset of disease, and 5-6 months to reveal major pathological changes. It is recommended that no more than 100 µl should be taken every 4 weeks, since excessive bleeding can lower the overall B cell counts, in particular, which will affect the development of lupus traits and the overall wellbeing of the mice.\n7. Check the mouse for anesthetic depth by pinching the toe.\n8. Once the mouse is anesthetized, restrain the mouse gently at the back of the neck until the eye is slightly bulging.\n9. Collect blood as follows:\n         \nPlace the tip of a capillary tube at approximately a 90° angle to the nose at the medial canthus of the eye, under the nictitating membrane.\nApply slight pressure to break the conjunctival membranes and the ocular plexus/sinus. The blood will flow into the hematocrit tube by capillary action. Move the capillary tube so the angle to the nose is reduced to about 45° to enable faster blood flow.\nCollect the blood in a Microvette® Z (for sera) or Microvette® LH (for plasma).",
    "Once blood begins to flow, maintain gentle pressure to keep the eye protruded. Tilting the head slightly downward improves blood flow. At the end of study, prior to immediate euthanasia, 200 µl can be collected in each tube. The blood flow should stop when the capillary tube is withdrawn, the grip is loosened, and pressure is gently applied to the eye for a few seconds.\n10. Place the blood collection tube on ice immediately after collection to prevent high background in future assays.\n11. End study protocol: Euthanize the mouse (Donovan & Brown, 2006a[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0016]) either with carbon dioxide inhalation or cervical dislocation, according to the approved IACUC protocol.\nCollection of tissues\nGlomerulonephritis (GN) develops at 5-7 months of age in male BXSB mice, and female NZB/W, Sle123, Sle1Yaa, Sle1Tg7, and 4-5 months in Sle1TLR9-/- mice. It is a key feature assessed in these systems due to its prevalence in clinical disease. Overt kidney disease can be observed as a reduction in total organ size (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-fig-0002]), or increased pallor. In most cases, however, in the absence of stimulation (e.g., IFNα), gross changes are not evident. It is recommended that investigators outsource all GN examinations to a clinical pathologist to obtain independent results, and to ensure relevance to clinical disease (Seavey, Lu, & Stump, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0046]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/32d4b852-2d79-4b65-9cf3-d41fafd25498/cpz1272-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",

Additionally a Mann-Whitney test was used to determine additional associations, ###p < 0.001, ####p < 0.0001, using GraphPad Prism Version 9.0 for Windows.\nThe development of splenomegaly is a characteristic trait of most murine lupus models and not observed in the majority of SLE patients. It provides a rapid assessment of lupus-associated traits. Overt signs can be detected between 4 and 6 months in the NZB/W, BXSB, Sle123 and Sle1-associated strains (Fig. 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-fig-0002] and 2C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-fig-0002]).\n12.

Remove additional fat and connective tissue from the outside of the spleen and weigh, recording the findings.",
    "Following the euthanasia and collection of tissues for immunological and pathology examination, the tissues are processed into single-cell suspensions for flow cytometry or prepared in fixatives or tissue preservatives. Given the length of time of the protocol, the kidney for single-cell analysis is processed initially; the portion of the spleen for DC analysis second; and the section of the spleen for plasmacytoid (p)DC, B, T, and myeloid cell analysis after that. All tissues should be kept on ice as much as possible unless the protocol dictates otherwise. Tissues for pathology and those set aside for microscopy analyses can be prepared for storage during the incubation and centrifugation times if personnel is limited. Templates for tissue processing (Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-fig-0003]) and cell count calculations for subsequent cell staining (Fig. 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-fig-0003]) can also be set up prior to the experiment.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/bf9e27a2-7c9f-4196-b3fe-103efed6517e/cpz1272-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nRecommended Excel spreadsheets for sample collection.

Uncap a new set of 50-ml conical tubes and cut nylon mesh to cover the opening of each tube.\nAlternatively, sterile 70-μm cell strainers can be used.\n13. Transfer the 5-ml kidney suspension through the filter into the new 50-ml conical tube.\nEach pellet will be filtered into a new tube.\n14. Wash the old tube with an additional 5 ml RPMI 1640 and transfer to the new tube through the filter (total 10 ml). Remove and discard the filter.\n15. To the 10 ml cell suspension, add 10 ml of 40% Percoll, and mix by inverting.\n16. Centrifuge 20 min at 1864 × g, room temperature, with no brake.\n17. Aspirate the supernatant with debris and smaller tissue cells carefully. Since the pellet is soft, leave a small volume of liquid if necessary.\n18. Resuspend the pellet in 1 ml and add 4 ml of FACS staining buffer (total 5 ml).\n19. Centrifuge 5 min at 453 × g, 4°C, with the brake on.\n20. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend in 1 ml FACS staining buffer. Maintain on ice until staining.\nFreezing cells is not recommended, as this will reduce cellular viability by ∼50%. The user should continue to the staining protocol and fix the samples before running on the flow cytometer the next day.\nSplenic processing into a single-cell suspension\n21.

Aliquot 100 µl/well in a round-bottom 96-well plate.\n39. At this stage, there should be 2 million cells from the collagenase-processed spleen and 1 million cells from the non-collagenase-processed spleen. Maintain the cells on ice until ready to add the flow cytometry staining reagents. This time should not exceed 1 hr.\nRed blood cell lysis (using commercial reagents or distilled water) is not recommended in this protocol, due to the loss of neutrophils and activation of myeloid cells that can occur. The final stage of the flow cytometry staining protocol includes a fix/lyse step, described below.",
    "SLE is an immunological disease; however, the majority of described protocols do not assess the immunological cellular changes that occur with disease onset. An expansion and hyperactivation of leukocytes, including B cells, T cells, dendritic cells (DCs), and myeloid cells, contributes to the development of end-organ pathology (Pathak & Mohan, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0037]). Therefore, the flow cytometry assays described here are used to identify key changes in these leukocytes exhibited in lupus-prone models. It is recommended that the user be experienced at flow cytometry. Excellent guidelines for flow cytometry have been described (Cossarizza et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0011]). Use standard flow cytometer machine setup protocols. Ensure that the negative unstained control is on scale and that photomultiplier tube (PMT) settings are adjusted so that the fluorochrome is brightest in its designated channel compared to every other channel. Before running any sample, check the setup with one fully stained B6 sample to make sure that the flow cytometer has been set up appropriately. All antibodies used in the panels should be titrated for optimal use, and the multi-color panel should be tested prior to the end of study. This is usually done with a naïve, B6 strain and a severe lupus-prone strain, given the changes indicated in this protocol.\nMaterials\nSplenocytes (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-prot-0002], step 38a or 32b) or kidney cells (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-prot-0002], step 20)\nBlocking Ig: Rat anti–mouse FcγRII/III (BD, cat. no. 553142) or supernatant of the 24G2 cell line\nThis should be titrated to optimize for blocking by using a directly conjugated anti-FcγRII/III antibody in a similar staining strategy to that described below.",

Prepare the peripheral blood (see “b” steps below) in a separate plate.\nPrepare fluorescently labeled antibody cocktails at this stage or up to 1 hr before expected addition.\n2a. Pellet the cells by centrifuging the plates 5 min at 453 × g, 4°C.\n3a. Check that the cells have pelleted at the bottoms of the wells of the 96-well plate. Flick off the supernatant from the spleen and kidney plates.\nThis should be done with one firm flick, binging the arm back and thrusting once firmly into the sink to expel the supernatant. If this action is not firm, cells will dribble out with the supernatant.",
    "4a. To the cell pellet, add 25 µl (for splenocytes), or 35 µl (for collagenase splenocytes/kidney cells) of blocking IgG in FACS staining buffer at twice the concentration (2×) of the final desired concentration (5 µg/ml anti-FcγRII/III or 2× of the titrated 24G2 supernatant). Do not wash.\n5a. Add an equal volume of antibody at 2× concentration in FACS staining buffer. For single-fluorochrome color compensation controls, 25 µl of the specific primary antibody at optimal concentration in FACS staining buffer should be added. This can be anything from 1:25 to 1:1600, so the final concentration is 1:50 to 1:800.\nInitial experiments should be completed to determine the optimal concentration of the antibody purchased. For actual samples using the multi-parameter panel, a master panel mix should be made containing the optimized concentrations of fluorescently conjugated antibodies. Prepare a fluorescence minus one (FMO) cocktail for any surface marker with no clear positivity. This FMO will contain all other antibodies for the panel, except one, to set a clear boundary for the positive fraction of cells. If the master panel does not work well, setting up a series of FMO stains will identify problems in the panel.\n6a. Incubate the cells on ice for 30 min in the dark.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: For standard panels that analyze myeloid cells, everything is maintained on ice due to the labile nature of neutrophils and monocytes which change their surface receptor expression post isolation and during gentle agitation. Note temperature changes for T cell evaluation of CXCR5 below.",
    "7a. For T cell panels, include 2× anti-CXCR5 (see Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl-0002]) in the initial anti-FcγRII/III stage (step 4a). Incubate with 25 µl of the anti-CXCR5/block solution for 15 min at 37°C (depending on the clone of antibody). Add all other antibodies in a master mix (2×) as for other panels, and incubate on ice for 30 min, before continuing as for all other panels.\n8a. Wash the cells three times with FACS staining buffer, each time by centrifuging 5 min at 453 × g, 4°C.\n9a. For panels with additional secondary antibody staining, such as the B cell and T cell panels, add the fluorescently labeled streptavidin anti-biotin conjugate (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl-0001]) for a period of 30 min, on ice.\nThis is recommended for low-expressing markers, e.g., anti-Fas in the B cell panel, and anti-CXCR5 in the T cell panel.\n10a. Wash cells once with FACS staining buffer as in step 8a, above, then add 100 µl BD FACS Lysing Solution, making sure to break the cell pellets up when adding. After 30 s, add 100 µl FACS staining buffer and centrifuge immediately for 5 min at 1500 rpm/5 min/4°C\n11a. Wash the cells two times with FACS staining buffer , each time by centrifuging 5 min at 453 × g, 4°C.\n12a. Flick off supernatant as above and add 1% paraformaldehyde. Maintain at 4°C in the dark until analysis on the flow cytometer. Acquire on a flow cytometer within 36 hr.\n13a. If storing flow cytometry samples overnight before acquiring data, it is recommended that time be set aside for centrifuging and resuspending the samples in FACS staining buffer before filtering with 70-µm nylon mesh into Falcon® round-bottom polystyrene tubes before running FACS. This will reduce variability between samples and prevent clogging of the machine.\nMethods II: Peripheral blood",
    "In some cases, detection of peripheral blood T cell activation can provide useful information about ongoing disease. The following protocol can be used to assess immunological phenotypes in the peripheral blood of lupus mice. Due to the leukopenia and anemia observed in some models with severe disease, care should be taken at the lysis step to prevent over-lysing and leukocyte cell death.\n1b. Pipette 100 µl of peripheral blood (from same mouse as kidney/spleen) into a 96-well round bottom tissue culture plate separate from the kidney/splenocytes.\n2b. Add 100 µl of PBS to the peripheral blood and attach a plate sealer to eliminate well-to-well contamination.\n3b. Centrifuge the plates 5 min at 453 × g, 4°C.\n4b. Aspirate 130 µl of the clear plasma/PBS from the peripheral blood carefully.\n5b. Add 70 µl of master antibody mix for B, T, or myeloid cells (1, 2, or 3) and incubate in the refrigerator for 30 min.\n6b. Following the incubation, add 80 µl of FACS staining buffer, and centrifuge as in step 3b, above.\n7b. Aspirate the supernatant carefully and add 150 µl BD FACS Lysing Solution. Mix well by pipetting up and down and incubate for 5 full minutes. Centrifuge as in step 3b, above.\n8b. Aspirate the supernatant carefully and add 100 µl of BD FACS Lysing Solution. Mix well by pipetting up and down and incubate for 1-2 min. Observe the cell suspension for translucency. Add 100 µl FACS staining buffer to the wells when the cell suspension has turned translucent.\nThis prevents excessive lysis and cell death.\n9b. Wash the cells two times in staining buffer, each time for 5 min at 453 × g, 4°C. Resuspend in 1% paraformaldehyde and keep in the dark and on ice before running on a flow cytometer.",
    "All peripheral blood samples should be run within 36 hr.\n10b. If storing flow cytometry samples overnight before acquiring, it is recommended that time be set aside for centrifuging and resuspending the samples in staining buffer before filtering with 70-µm nylon mesh into Falcon® round-bottom polystyrene tubes before FACS. This will reduce variability between samples and prevent clogging of the machine.\nFlow cytometry analysis of key leukocytes in SLE\nThe fluorochromes and capacity of the flow cytometry panel depend on the capability and equipment that the user has access to. Therefore, in this protocol, suggestions are given of panels to identify key changes in spleens and kidney of lupus-prone mice, with some examples. The investigator should optimize their own panels to suit their flow cytometry skills and equipment.\nB cell subsets\nB cells play a critical role in the development of lupus. They produce the autoantibodies that are a hallmark of SLE. The major splenic B cell changes that occur across multiple lupus models include the expansion of plasma cells and germinal center (GC) B cells, and the reduction of the marginal zone (Mz) B cells. These can be analyzed separately across several panels in a 4-color format (Table 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl-0005]), or in a larger (single) panel (Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl-0001], Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-fig-0004]), depending on the available equipment. Exclusion of dead cells using viability dyes and the use of open (unused) channels for the exclusion of auto-fluorescent particles will also provide increased resolution. Additional antibodies can also be used to assess activation and maturation. CD69 is up-regulated in a transient manner following activation. Age-associated B cells (ABCs) are expanded in lupus, and can be detected using CD11c+CD11b+. Transitional and B1 subsets can also be identified using additional markers.\nTable 5.\n                Essential Markers for Identifying Key B Cell Phenotypes in Spleens from Lupus-Prone Micea[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl5-note-0001_72]",

Peanut Agglutinin (PNA) can be used instead for resolution if this is an issue.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1b499be0-be08-4191-869e-1098669ccee4/cpz1272-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nGating strategy to show the identification of major B cell phenotypes in lupus-prone mice.

This table is for example only.\nT cell subsets",
    "CD4+ T cell subsets play critical roles in disease development and progression. They provide help to other leukocytes through ligand-receptor interactions with dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells, and through the secretion of cytokines. Activated and memory T cells are expanded in SLE, whereas regulatory T (TREG) compartments are reduced, with lower efficacies (Ohl & Tenbrock, 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0036]). In addition, there is an expansion of the T follicular helper population (Tfh) with a concomitant increase in the expression of PD-1 and ICOS. The key T cell subsets used in lupus-prone murine systems are shown in Table 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl-0006]; these can be analyzed separately across several panels in a 4-5 color format, or alternatively combined in a single panel (Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl-0002]), depending on the available flow cytometry equipment. Additionally, regulatory T cells (Tregs) can be assessed using antibodies to CD25 and the intracellular transcription factor, foxp3.\nTable 6.\n                Essential Markers for Identifying Key T Subsetsa[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl6-note-0001_82]\ntable:\n﻿T cell lineage,Naïve/memory,T follicular helper (Tfh) and activation\nCD45,CD45,CD45\nCD3,CD3,CD3\nCD4,CD4,CD4\nCD8,CD8,ICOS\n,CD62L,CXCR5\n,CD44,PD1\na Following single-cell resolution, reduction of auto-fluorescent cells and CD45+ leukocyte identification, T cell subsets can be identified using the combinations shown.

    "NZB/W, NZM2410, Sle123 and Sle1-related severe disease strains are associated with myelopoesis. The introduction of a simple or complex staining panel can be used to identify the major change in the leukocyte subsets, which will show this myeloid expansion, or changes in less frequent populations. Table 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl-0007] describes key markers used to identify key leukocyte alterations associated with lupus-like traits. The use of additional markers (CD19, CD3, NK1.1) enables the exclusion of B, T, and NK cells, which is necessary given their capacity to also express myeloid-associated surface expression markers. In addition, the autofluorescence of granulocytes, which may result in their inclusion of other myeloid and dendritic cell (DC) populations, may be removed using anti-Gr1. DC panels identified in Table 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl-0007] Table 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl-0008] can be further divided into smaller panels to identify plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs; CD45+mPDCA1+B220+SiglecH+), which secrete high levels of type I interferon (IFN), and conventional (c) CD45+CD11c+MHC+ DC subsets, which include CD8+ and CD103+ cDCs (DC1) and CD11b+ cDCs (cDC2) (Desch et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0013]; Jakubzick, Helft, Kaplan, & Randolph, 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0024]; Sung et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0049]; Vermaelen & Pauwels, 2004[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0052]).\nTable 7.\n                Essential Markers for Identifying Key Changes in Leukocyte Lineages in Lupus-Prone Micea[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl7-note-0001_96]\ntable:\n﻿\"Lineage, myelopoeisis, and DC expansion\",\"Lineage, myelopoeisis, and DC expansion\",\"Lineage, myelopoeisis, and DC expansion\"\nMajor leukocyte lineages,Myeloid subsets,DC subsets\nCD45,CD45,CD45\nCD4,CD3/B220/NK1.1b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl7-note-0002_97],Gr1/CD3/CD19/NK1.1b[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl7-note-0002_98]\nCD8,CD11b,B220\nCD19,Gr1,mPDCA1\nCD11b,CD11c,CD8\nCD3,Ly6G,CD11c\n,F4/80,MHCII\n,CD115c[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl7-note-0003_99] and/or Ly6G,CD11b\n,,F4/80\n,,CD103\na Following single-cell resolution, reduction of auto-fluorescent cells, and CD45+ leukocyte identification, assessment of the most frequent populations, together with more refined analyses of the typical myeloid expansion, can be completed using the combinations shown.\nb Other leukocytes maybe gated out using a “sink” gate, with all antibodies to non-desired markers bound to the same bright fluorochrome.",
    "c CD115 does not work well for kidney samples due to the collagenase in the preparation. In this case, exclusion of NK cells, T cells, and DCs can be used to confirm monocytes. Neutrophils can also be separated out by their specificity to Ly6G.

We recommend teamwork at the cohort processing stage to keep processing time at a minimum (see Time Considerations). Extended time taken can result in apoptosis and the loss of surface markers on leukocytes.\n2.0,High variability in ANA values; high ANAs titers in B6 control mice.,Maintenance of blood at the incorrect temperature,Blood is stored immediately on wet ice for this protocol to reduce background in ANA ELISAs\n3.0,Incomplete resolution of leukocytes in peripheral blood.,Incomplete or too much lysis of tissue,\"The presence of too many red blood cells in the peripheral blood staining particularly can result in challenges in the analysis of the leukocyte population. Using a time without optimization can result in leukocyte cell death, particularly neutrophils.\"\n4.0,No neutrophils in the lineage panel,Poor storage or excessive red blood cell lysis,\"Blood and tissues are maintained on wet ice, and changes in temperature should be avoided to prevent clumping and loss of neutrophils. Excessive lysis, or use of ACK lysis buffer, will eliminate neutrophils. Lysis should be completed at the end of the flow cytometry protocol, in a fix/lyse step to maintain the more delicate leukocyte subsets, particularly the myeloid population.\"",
    "5.0,Increased background in flow plots; no clear resolution of leukocyte subsets,Dim fluorochrome chosen for CD45; or fluorescently labeled antibodies not titrated effectively; or increased dead cells in sample preparation,\"We have found that pecy7 and APC are optimal for CD45 for tissue analysis of infiltrating leukocytes. The use of a viability dye to exclude dead cells will enhance resolution of cell populations in flow cytometry analysis: Zombie-apccy7 (Zombie NIR™ Fixable Viability Kit, Biolegend cat. no. 423106) or 7-AAD.\"\n6.0,Unable to collect urine from sick mice for protein analysis,Sick mice urinate less,\"As others have recommended before us (Seavey, Lu et al. 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0046]), we recommend allocating time for sampling 2-3 weeks, prior to the endpoint sacrifice date to ensure urine collection.\"\n7.0,Difficulty in syringing kidney tissue during single cell preparation,This indicates that the DNase is not of sufficient quality or degraded,\"Optimization of DNase concentration is then recommended, or purchase fresh DNase\"\n8.0,\"Poor resolution of CD45, despite choosing optimal fluorochrome and optimizing dilution\",This indicates apoptosis or overloaded cell number for the volume of master mix. It can also indicate decoupling of antibody tandem dyes.,\"Do not overload cell number in plate; if larger cell numbers are needed for acquisition, titrate cell number and antibody solution volume. Store all antibodies in the dark, and check before use if they exceed the storage life indicated by the manufacturer.\"",
    "Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl-0003] shows a panel that provides a capacity to analyze all populations shown in Table 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl-0007]. Similar panel designs have been described previously (Celhar et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0009]; Celhar et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0008]). Additional antibodies can be included to assess activation, such as CD80 and CD86, which increase on DCs, and CD62L, but are lost from the cell surface of neutrophils and monocytes. The advantages of reducing time during a cohort-euthanizing day by using one expansive panel can be offset by the user's ability to run high-dimensional panels. Therefore, this must be considered with care.\nAn example of the gating strategy to stratify subsets using the panel indicated in Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-tbl-0003] is shown in Figure 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-fig-0009]. A full description with the changes in the splenic leukocytes exhibited in lupus-prone mice is shown in Figure 10[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-fig-0010].

    "ANAs in mice that develop severe disease (Sle123, Sle1Tg7, Sle1TLR9-/-) are usually identified in 10%-30% mice at around 12 weeks, with 90% penetrance at around 6 months of age (Celhar et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0009]; Fairhurst et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0019]; Hwang et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-bib-0022]).

For the second wash, rest the plate for 5 min before flicking and pat dry onto stacked paper towels.\n20. Wash the plate twice with at least 200 µl of PBS. Flick the plate dry. For the second wash, rest the plate for 5 min before flicking and pat dry onto stacked paper towels. Complete this step only when the substrate is ready to load.\n21. Combine 5 ml of 0.025 M sodium bicarbonate (pH 9.6), 20 µl of stock 1 M magnesium chloride, and one pNPP tablet. Ensure that it is mixed well without any particulates.\n22. Add 50 µl/well rapidly, using a multichannel pipettor.\n23. Incubate on a shaker in the dark for at least 30 min.\n24. Read the absorbance at 405 nM at 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after the addition of substrate.\nELISA analysis and expected results\nWhen using a standard from a severe disease strain, log curves should be generated in the appropriate software to find best-fit association (Fig. 13A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-fig-0013]). Samples with values obtained in the extrapolation region above the fitted curve or line can be diluted further and re-run in additional assays. It is recommended that the lowest dilution used in the assays be 1:50, to avoid background signals, and therefore values below the fitted line or equation can be viewed as estimates. GraphPad Prism software provides a user-friendly approach to calculating ELISA values.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/96bc9bb8-4b33-4dc7-9665-6f40e9e7115a/cpz1272-fig-0013-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 13",
    "Examples of ANA ELISA analysis in lupus-prone mice. (A) Example of a sigmoidal dose-response curve of pooled serum from Sle1Yaa mice. Arbitrary units are set for serial dilutions (left panel), and this is log transformed to calculate unknowns (right panel). Graphs generated in GraphPad Prism. (B) Examples of cumulative data of ANAs in a cohort of 5-month-old Sle123 mice and B6 controls, and from 6-month-old Sle1Tg7 mice and Sle1 controls showing anti-nucleosome, (B) anti-dsDNA (C), and anti-snRNP antibodies (D). Data was tested for Gaussian distribution using the KS normality test. Parametric data was assessed using Welch's unpaired t-test that does not assume equal variances; *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, non-parametric data was assessed using Mann-Whitney test; #p < 0.05, ##p < 0.01, using GraphPad Prism Version 9.0 for Windows.\nTo assess positivity and penetrance of ANAs, the average (mean) of the B6 strain should be taken and added to 2 standard deviation values of the B6 strain (mean ± 2StDev). All samples above this value can then be viewed as positive. Examples of the expected results of the serum ANA are shown in Figure 13C[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-fig-0013]-E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.272#cpz1272-fig-0013]."
