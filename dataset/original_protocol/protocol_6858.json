    "Naïve CD4+ T cell isolation and seeding.Day -2, pre-coat 200 μl TCR-stimulating antibody mixture/well in a 48 well-plate at 4°C.Day 0, euthanize a C57BL/6J mouse (or IL17A-IRES-GFP-KI mouse), harvest the spleen and lymph nodes (LNs), and isolate naïve CD4+ T cells using the MojoSort™ Isolation Kit[href=https://www.biolegend.com/protocols/mojosort-isolation-kits-protocol-1/4599/] according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Note: Basic information regarding the anatomy of a laboratory mouse can be found at http://www.informatics.jax.org/cookbook/[href=http://www.informatics.jax.org/cookbook/].Count the cells and seed 2.5 × 105 cells/well in the pre-coated 48-well plate with 500 μl TH17 polarization medium at 37°C/5% CO2.Note: To follow T cell proliferation, it is optional to stain naive CD4+ T cells with CFSE according to the manufacturer’s instructions. FACS analysis of TH17 cell differentiation (Figure 1)Day 3 (or anytime between day 2 and day 5; we routinely observed over 40% IL17+ cells starting at day 2 and remaining for 3 additional days until the media's nutrients are depleted), treat the cells for 4 h with Cell Stimulation Cocktail Plus Protein Transport Inhibitors according to the manufacturer’s for 4 h, and then stain the cells with the anti-mouse CD4 antibody (1:100) for 30 min at 4°C. Next, fix and permeabilize the cells using the FoxP3 Fixation/Permeabilization Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Finally, stain the cells with the anti-IL-17A antibody (1:100) at RT for 15 min before FACS analysis (if cultured cells are from an IL17A-IRES-GFP-KI mouse, FACS analysis can be performed directly without the procedures described above in B).Note: Basic principles and applications of flow cytometry can be found in the literature (McKinnon, 2018). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4029/bioprotoc-11-10-4029-g001.jpgFigure 1.
