    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGeneration of beads\nTiming: 2 days\nIn the first step, amine functionalized reagents 1,2,3,4 or C (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) are coupled to commercially available Affi-Gel 15, which contains an already activated NHS ester (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Make sure that you conduct all steps at 4°C. Centrifugation of the beads is always conducted at 2,000 × g. All buffers can be prepared in advanced and stored at 4°C for at least 4 weeks.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/410-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative scheme to illustrate coupling of amino-functionalized 5PCP-InsP5 to Affi-gel 15\nPipette ∼650 μL of Affi-Gel 15 beads into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and centrifuge for 1 min. For pipetting, use a 1 mL tip and cut off the top of the tip. Make sure that, after centrifugation, you have more than 500 μL of bead suspension inside the tube.\nAfter centrifugation remove the supernatant carefully and add 800 μL of a 0.01% Triton X-100 solution.\nNote: For removing the supernatant, it is easiest to use a micro tip or a gel loading tip stuck onto a 1 mL tip.\nCentrifuge again for 1 min and remove the supernatant. Repeat this washing cycle with 800 μL of 0.01% Triton X-100 one more time so that three washing steps total are carried out.\nMake sure you have 500 μL of bead suspension in every Eppendorf tube. If you have more than 500 μL, remove excess beads.\nNote: Eppendorf tubes have a 500 μL measure.\nAdd 500 μL of freshly prepared compound solution and incubate via orbital rotation for 12–14 h at 4°C.\nPause Point: Incubate for 12–14 h",
    "Centrifuge bead solution for 1 min and collect the supernatant carefully in an extra 15 mL tube. Wash beads as described above three times and collect the supernatant every time in the dedicated tube. The combined supernatants will be used for determining coupling efficiency.\nCritical: Make sure to pipette very carefully, do not remove additional beads.\nAdd 750 μL of milliQ water and 50 μL of a 1 M Ethanolamine solution (pH 8). Incubate for 1 h at 4°C via orbital rotation.\nCentrifuge for 1 min and collect the supernatant. Wash the beads with 800 μL of a 0.01% Triton X-100 solution and store the beads after the last washing step by adding 500 μL of a 2% (w/v) sodium azide solution.\nFor determination of the coupling yield, lyophilize the collected supernatants from step 6. Redissolve the remaining solid in 500 μL D2O. Add 37.5 μL of a 40 mM phosphonoacetic acid standard.\nMeasure a quantitative 31P-NMR spectrum and compare the intensity of the signal of the standard at ∼15.7 ppm (1,500 nmol) with the intensity of the signals corresponding to the unbound compound (see Expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]).\nCritical: For quantification by 31P-NMR spectroscopy you need to use an experiment with a long delay time between the scans, that corresponds to about 5 ∗ T1 relaxation time. The coupling efficiency is usually between 30% and 50%.",
    "Optional: If you do not have access to an NMR facility, another way of determining the success of coupling is by using recombinant protein. This protein should be known to interact with the modified resin. We recommend using the SPX domain of Vtc4 or the phosphohydrolase NUDT3. The plasmids can be obtained from Addgene. For expression details, see Wild and Hothorn (2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) or Wu et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]. For assay conditions please refer to Wu et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] or Furkert et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]. It is important to note, however, that this approach will not provide a quantitative assessment of the coupling efficiency.\nCell lysis, preparation of cell lysate\nTiming: 3 h\nIn this step, the cell lysate is prepared for subsequent affinity enrichment. After aspirating the media all steps should be conducted on ice.\nCulture HEK293T (female origin) or HCT116 (male origin) cells to 70%–80% confluency in 15 cm dishes in cell culture medium (see Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). Alternatively, any other mammalian cell line can be cultured, given the appropriate growth medium.\nWash the cells twice with 10 mL ice-cold DPBS per 15 cm dish and lyse with 2.7 mL Pierce IP Lysis buffer, supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitors (Roche PhosStop and cOmplete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail).\nNote: Protease and phosphatase inhibitors should be completely dissolved in the lysis buffer before use.\nScrape the cells off with a cell scraper, transfer them with a pipette to protein low binding microcentrifuge tubes, and incubated on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 4°C for 10 min at 17,900 × g.\nCombine the supernatants in a 15 mL falcon tube and determine the protein concentration using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay kit. Store the lysate in the meantime at 4°C.",
    "Dilute the cell lysate with IP lysis buffer to reach a final concentration of 3 mg/mL.\nAffinity enrichment\nTiming: 4 h\nAt this stage, the lysate from the previous step is incubated with the affinity reagents to enrich proteins that interact with the inositol (pyro)phosphates. IPm lysis buffer can be prepared in advance and stored for at least 4 weeks at 4°C.\nCritical: All steps should be conducted at 4°C.\nTransfer 200 μL of the prepared bead suspension (stored in 2% sodium azide solution) to a protein low bind tube.\nWash the beads three times with 1 mL of IPm lysis buffer.\nAfter removing the supernatant, add 1 mL of cell lysate (3 mg/mL) to the beads and incubate with constant rotation for 1 h.\nCentrifuge the tubes for 1 min and remove the supernatant.\nWash the beads three times with 1 mL of IPm lysis buffer.\nAfter removal of the supernatant, add 150 μL of an InsP6- or 5PCP-InsP5-elution solution to the beads and incubate for 60 min under orbital rotation.\nCollect the supernatant and freeze it in liquid nitrogen. Store the samples at −80°C. For proteomic analysis and label-free quantification, a minimum of four technical replicates should be performed. Before preparing the samples for mass spectrometry, it is advisable to test success of enrichment via western blot analysis of a small aliquot for known binding partners. We recommend blotting for OCRL (primary antibody is commercially available).\nNote: Four technical replicates were used to improve the statistical significance of the measured LFQ values. At least three replicates should be recorded.\nPause Point: The samples can be stored at −80°C for several months.\nSample preparation for proteomic analysis\nTiming: 2 days\nIn this section, the enriched protein samples are prepared via in-gel digestion for proteomic analysis.",
    "Note: In-solution digestion can also be used at this step.\nAdd 5 μL of a 4 mM DTT solution to 90 μL of enriched protein lysate. Incubate for 30 min at 55°C.\nAfter the samples reach 22°C–26°C, add 5 μL of a freshly prepared 15 mM chloroacetamide solution and incubate for 30 min at 22°C–26°C.\nQuench by adding 33 μL of Laemmli buffer 4× (see Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) and incubate the solution at 95°C for 10 min.\nLoad 50 μL on a 10 well 4%–20% SDS-PAGE gel and let the sample run until the whole sample has transferred from the loading well into the agarose gel and no sample is left in the loading pockets.\nNote: We recommend to leave a free lane between each sample.\nWash the gel three times with water.\nStain the gel with Bio-Rad Bio-safe Coomassie G-250 stain for 12–14 h.\nCut out the stained gel bands and transfer each of them into a 0.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nWash the gel bands with 200 μL wash solution, shake for 10 min at 30°C, and remove the wash solution.\nEquilibrate the gel bands with 200 μL equilibration buffer and shake for 10 min at 30°C, then remove the equilibration solution.\nShrink the gel pieces by adding 200 μL acetonitrile and incubate for 1 min and remove the acetonitrile solution. Repeat the shrinking step once more.\nNote: The color of the gel pieces should turn white at this step, indicating complete dehydration of the gel pieces.\nDigest the proteins with 0.1 μg trypsin solution for 12–14 h at 37°C on a shaker.\nPause Point: Digest protein until next morning\nSpin down the samples and afterwards stop digestion using 30 μL of the stop solution to extract the peptides.\nTransfer the supernatant to a glass vial for HPLC use.",
    "Shrink the gel again by dehydration with 20 μL acetonitrile, vortex gently for a few seconds.\nTransfer the supernatant to the same glass vial from step 36.\nDry the sample in a speedVac vacuum and concentrate the sample until the solvent is completely removed/evaporated. It takes approximately 30–50 min.\nCritical: Do not leave the samples in the speedVac vacuum for too long. Over-drying the samples might cause difficulties in recovering the peptides.\nPause Point: Dried peptides can be stored at −80°C until subjected to the LC-MS/MS analysis.\nLC-MS/MS analysis\nTiming: days to weeks\nIn this protocol, a Dionex UltiMate 3000 system coupled with an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer is used. A PepMap C-18 trap-column (Thermo Fischer Scientific) of 0.075 mm ID × 50 mm length is utilized; 3 μm particle size and 100 Å pore size for sample trapping. Mobile phase A contains 1% acetonitrile and 0.05% TFA acid in water, and mobile phase B 0.05% TFA acid in acetonitrile. For sample separation, a 200 cm μPAC column is employed (PharmaFluidics, Ghent, Belgium), with mobile phase A containing 0.1% formic acid in water, and mobile phase B 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile.\nDissolve the samples in 6 μL of 1% acetonitrile + 0.05% TFA in water.\nSonicate the samples in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min and place them in the HPLC.\nInject 3 μL of the sample (equivalent to 0.5–1 μg) into the HPLC system.\nTrapping of the sample is carried out with a trap C-18 column at a flow rate of 5.6 μL/min for 5 min, using mobile phase A.\nSamples are separated with alternating flow rate of 750 nL/min and 350 nL/min, see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_410_2.csv",
    "Note: The μPAC column enables high flow rate separation because of its low back pressure, the lower flow rate is used to get optimized spray in the middle and at the end of the gradient.\nMS scans are acquired in DDA mode. MS1 scan are acquired in the Orbitrap with a range of 350–1,500 m/z, mass resolution of 120,000, AGC target value of 4e5 and 50 ms injection time. MS2 scans are acquired in the ion trap with an AGC target value of 1e4 and 35 ms injection time. Precursor ions with charge states 2–4 are isolated with an isolation window of 1.6 m/z and 40 s dynamic exclusion. Precursor ions are fragmented using higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with 30% normalized collision energy. Cycle time is set to 1 s. Data acquisition is done with Xcalibur software 4.2 and tune 3.1.\nAnalysis and processing of the raw data is conducted with MaxQuant software version 1.6.2.6a, keeping the MaxQuant standard settings. In the search parameters two missed cleavage sites are included, the fixed modification is set to cysteine carbamidomethyl modification, and variable modifications is set to methionine oxidation and N-terminal protein acetylation. The peptide mass tolerance is set to 4.5 ppm for MS scans and 20 ppm for MS/MS scans. Enable the match between runs option. The Human UniProt/Swiss-Prot database version 2016-10 (https://[href=https://www.uniprot.org/)is]www.uniprot.org/[href=http://www.uniprot.org/])is searched using Andromeda. The false discovery rate (FDR) is set to 1% for both peptide and protein level. Protein quantification is based on at least 2 razor and unique peptides. Enable Label-free quantification and iBAQ calculation.",
    "Bioinformatic analysis is carried out using Perseus software (Tyanova et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). The ProteinGroup file, which is an output file of MaxQuant (Cox and Mann, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), is imported into Perseus software version 1.6.7.0. Proteins are filtered to exclude reverse database hits, potential contaminants, and proteins only identified by site. Proteins are filtered by rows, requiring a valid value for at least two proteins out of four technical replicates. The date is Log2(x) transformed and impute using Perseus default parameters, 0.3 width and 1.8 down shift. Volcano plots are generated using a t test (number of randomizations: 250) and FDR = 0.01 and S0 = 2.
