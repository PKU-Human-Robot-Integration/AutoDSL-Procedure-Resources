    "Modification of the 3’ terminal ends of DNA and RNA using PolθPurified Polθ is needed for modifying the 3’ terminal ends of DNA and RNA. Procedures for expressing and purifying Polθ from E. coli are described in previous studies (Hogg et al., 2011).Notes:  Synthetic single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and RNA typically ~10-50 nt (nucleotides) in length have been routinely modified in our laboratory. Thus, we recommend using nucleic acids of similar length for the following procedure. All reagents below are listed as final concentrations. A typical procedure for modifying ssDNA or RNA is described as follows:50-100 nM of the ssDNA or RNA to be modified is mixed with 50-500 μM concentration of the desired nucleotide used for modification in buffer A (see Recipes) along with 5 mM MnCl2 in a reaction volume of 10-20 μl. Note: We have not thoroughly tested the effects of different nucleotide concentrations. However, concentration ranges between 50-500 μM have shown efficient terminal transferase activity. Most of our previous reactions included 500 μM nucleotides. Reaction volumes can be varied according to preference and concentrations of ssDNA and RNA used successfully in the reaction in our experience are 50-100 nM. Importantly, the DNA or RNA must include a 3’ terminal nucleotide containing a hydroxyl group at the 3’ position of the sugar moiety for Polθ terminal transferase activity to occur.The terminal transferase reaction is then initiated by adding 200-500 nM purified Polθ and incubating at 42 °C for 2 h. Reactions are gently mixed with a pipette. Vortexing is not recommended. Reactions can be terminated by heating to ≥ 80 °C for 10 min or by the addition of ≥ 10 mM EDTA. Although the amount of Polθ can vary, optimal terminal transferase activity is observed with a 5-10 higher ratio of polymerase to nucleic acid molecule.",
    "We note that relatively high concentrations (i.e., > 50 mM) of salt (e.g., NaCl) suppress Polθ terminal transferase activity.The 2 h incubation time specified in the above procedure will give rise to multiple (i.e., 3 to > 100) terminal transfer events for most canonical nucleotides. However, in some cases only a single transfer event may occur depending on the particular nucleotide analog used. For example, certain nucleotide analogs may not be efficiently incorporated by Polθ and thus limit the enzyme to a single nucleotide transfer event. For determining the number of terminal transferase events that occur on a given substrate in the presence of particular nucleotides, we recommend visualizing the initial nucleic acid substrate and nucleic acid reaction products in a denaturing sequencing gel as described below in the Data analysis section.Examples of experimental procedures for modifying the 3’ terminal ends of DNA and RNA using PolθAs examples of Polθ terminal transferase activity on ssDNA and RNA, reactions were performed as follows. 50 nM of 5’ 32P radio-labeled ssDNA oligo (sequence indicated; Figures 1A and 1B) or RNA (sequence indicated; Figure 1C) was mixed with 50 µM (Figures 1A and 1B) or 500 µM. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170611/20170611235742_3866.jpgFigure 1.

Denaturing gels showing Polθ terminal transferase activity on the indicated ssDNA (A and B) and RNA (C) substrates in the presence of the indicated nucleotides. Lanes 1 lack Polθ and nucleotides.

    "Reactions were initiated by adding 200 nM of purified Polθ (stored in buffer B [see Recipes]), then incubating at 42 °C.After 2 h, reactions were terminated by adding 20 µl of 2x stop buffer (see Recipes).Radio-labeled ssDNA and RNA were then analyzed after denaturing gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described below in the Data analysis section. The data show that Polθ efficiently transfers nucleotides to the 3’ terminus of nucleic acid substrates as demonstrated in previous studies (Figure 1) (Kent et al., 2016). These experiments also demonstrate the ability of Polθ to efficiently transfer large nucleotide analogs, consistent with recent work (Kent et al., 2016). We note that Polθ may also be used to modify double-strand blunt ended DNA, however, fewer nucleotides are transferred to these substrates as demonstrated in previous work (Kent et al., 2016). Partial single-strand DNA containing 3’ overhangs are most efficiently extended by Polθ (Kent et al., 2016)."
