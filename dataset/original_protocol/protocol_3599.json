    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\ngDNA extraction\nTiming: 1–4 h\nThe following procedure is used to harvest gDNA from cells that have undergone CRISPR screening. Cells that have been transduced with a lentiviral library have integrated genomic DNA containing an sgRNA sequence and adaptor sequences complimentary to the forward and reverse primers (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The harvested gDNA will be used later for one-step PCR sample preparation for NGS. Refer to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] to obtain the minimum number of cells required for gDNA extraction for your selected library coverage.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/524-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Forward and reverse primer design\nForward PCR primers were designed to create a stagger sequence between the priming site and the Illumina sequence to facilitate diversity during NGS reads. Ten forward primers are pooled in each reaction with a stagger length of 1-10 bases. Reverse primers are designed to introduce a unique barcode to each sample. This barcode is used during analysis to identify individual samples within a pool. Details on primer design can be found in Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\nHarvest and centrifuge the selected number of cells (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes at 300 × g for 3 min at 20°C. Do not pellet more than 5 million cells per microcentrifuge tube. Use an automated cell counter or equivalent to count your cells.\nNote: The maximum capacity for PureLink Genomic DNA spin columns is ∼5 million cells for gDNA extraction.\nPause Point: You may store dry cell pellets at −80°C for up to 1 month or proceed to gDNA extraction.\nUse PureLink Genomic DNA extraction kit following manufacturer’s protocol to extract gDNA from cell pellets. Elute in Molecular Grade Water in final step. Please refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for gDNA extraction using the following link: (http://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/purelink_genomic_man.pdf[href=http://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/purelink_genomic_man.pdf])",
    "Critical: Do not process more than 5 million cells per column as this may cause the spin columns to clog and will decrease your yield. If more than 5 million cells is required to meet the depth of library coverage, extract gDNA in multiple spin columns and pool the gDNA after extraction.\nCritical: Ensure that there is no remaining volume of wash buffer above spin-column filters after centrifugation during washing steps. Repeat centrifuge step if there is a remaining volume of wash buffer above the spin column. Ethanol contamination from wash buffers will decrease your gDNA yield during the elution step.\nNote: Aim for a final concentration of at least 190 ng/μL (this is the minimum concentration needed to input 4 μg of gDNA into a single 50 μL PCR reaction). Generally, eluting in 50 μL Molecular Grade Water for 5 million processed cells yields concentrations >200 ng/μL.\nOptional: Perform a second elution with 20–30 μL additional Molecular Grade Water to recover more gDNA.\nObtain concentrations of extracted gDNA with Qubit dsDNA BR Assay Kit following manufacturer’s protocol (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/Qubit_dsDNA_BR_Assay_UG.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/Qubit_dsDNA_BR_Assay_UG.pdf])\nPause Point: You may store gDNA samples at −20°C for the duration of your experiment, or proceed to one-step PCR sample preparation. Your gDNA samples can be stored at −20°C for over 10 years.\nOne-step PCR sample preparation for NGS\nTiming: 2–4 h\nThe following procedure is for one-step PCR NGS sample preparation. Forward primers are designed to include a priming site adjacent to the guide spacer sequence and introduces the P5 Illumina adapter, as well as stagger sequences to allow for diversity during NGS reads. Reverse primers are designed to include a priming site adjacent to the UMI sequence and introduces the P7 Illumina adaptor as well as a unique barcode to allow for multiplexed NGS (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",
    "Thaw frozen PCR reagents.\nNote: Thaw 5× Herculase buffer and dNTP Mix on top of ice and keep on ice after they are thawed. All other PCR components (other than Herculase) can be thawed at 20°C.\nNote: Keep Herculase on ice or at −20°C until needed.\nNote: DMSO takes roughly 30–40 min to thaw at 20°C. You may aliquot DMSO into smaller volumes to save time thawing.\nMix equal volumes of each 10 μM forward primer 1–10 to make a pool of all 10 forward primers and use this during PCR setup.\nNote: Each of the forward primers is one base shorter than the next (Tables 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]). The different length primers improves NGS reads by adding diversity to the reads.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_524_2.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_524_3.csv\nSet Up PCR master mixes and negative control reactions for each sample (Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_524_4.csv\nFor the negative control master mix, unique reverse primers and template gDNA are not included. Instead, reverse primers are added to each reaction separately for each unique reverse primer used for the negative control PCR reactions. gDNA template is not included in the negative control reactions to ensure that PCR components are not contaminated.\nNote: There should be a negative control for every reverse primer used (i.e., A PCR setup for 10 samples with 10 unique reverse primers should also have 10 negative controls, with at least one negative control for each unique reverse primer). gDNA template is not included in the negative control reactions to ensure that PCR components are not contaminated.\nVortex master mixes for 15–20 s and spin down.\nAliquot 50 μL of the master mix to respectively labeled tubes.\nFor negative controls, aliquot 45.5 μL of negative control master mix and add 4.5 μL of 10 μM unique reverse primer to respectively labeled tubes and vortex.",
    "Spin down tubes at maximum speed for 10 s to ensure that all the liquid is at the bottom of the tube.\nProceed to thermocycling (see Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]). The Denature, annealing, and extension steps should occur in order for 24 total cycles.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_524_5.csv\nPool parallel PCR reactions and vortex to thoroughly mix (i.e., pool all PCR reactions with Sample A + Rev 1 primer and all reactions with Sample B + Rev 2 primer).\nPause Point: You can store pooled PCR products at −20°C or proceed.\nRun 5 μL of pooled PCR products and negative controls on a 1.5% TAE gel to confirm successful PCR. Expected band size should be approximately 350 bp.\nNote: This step can be performed in parallel with step 3 in purification of amplicons and gel quality control procedure.\nNote: Unused primers are usually visible on the gel at this stage (approximately 100 bp). These primers will be digested with Exonuclease I treatment during purification steps (see purification of amplicons and gel quality control test[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3] section).\nNote: A primer dimer band may appear on the gel in negative control lanes (approximately 200 bp). This is acceptable only if primer dimers are not present in reactions that receive DNA template.\nTransfer half or less of your pooled reaction in a separate labeled microcentrifuge tube to process for purification. Store remainder of the unpurified products at −20°C.\nNote: The quantity of PCR products far exceeds the amount needed to submit for NGS. We recommend taking a fraction of this product to process for purification steps so that there is plenty of unpurified samples to work from in case errors are made during purification.\nPause Point: You can store the aliquoted pooled PCR products at −20°C or proceed to purification steps.\nPurification of amplicons and gel quality control test",
    "Timing: 1–3 h\nThe following procedure describes how to purify the PCR products before submission for NGS. Free single-stranded primers, which carry P5/P7 adapter sequences and can bind the Illumina flow cell during NGS, are removed through Exonuclease I digestion. Exonuclease I will degrade any single-stranded oligonucleotides, including free primers remaining after the PCR. The PCR products are then further purified to remove PCR components through spin-column purification using the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit.\nExonuclease I digest - Add 1 μL Exonuclease I for every 10 μL of reaction (i.e., Add 10 μL Exonuclease I for 100 μL of reaction).\nIncubate reactions at 37°C for 1 h followed by a 20 min incubation at 80°C (see Table 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl6]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_524_6.csv\nSpin-column purify digested PCR products using the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit following manufacturer’s protocol (https://assets.fishersci.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0012662_GeneJET_PCR_Purification_UG.pdf[href=https://assets.fishersci.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/MAN0012662_GeneJET_PCR_Purification_UG.pdf]). Elute in 50 μL Molecular Grade Water in the final step.\nNote: There is an optional step that recommends adding 100% isopropanol to increase yield of products ≤500 bp. Add 100% isopropanol as suggested in the manufacturer’s protocol (size of amplicon of interest is ∼350 bp).\nPrepare 5 μL of purified samples to run on a 1.5% Tris-Acetate-EDTA (TAE) gel. There should be no visible primers on the gel at this stage (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/524-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Gel quality control test of unpurified and purified PCR products\nOne negative control for each independent sample (6 total) was run side by side with the unpurified and purified samples obtained in this protocol. Expected PCR band size is approximately 350 bp. Exonuclease I digest removes free primers from the PCR product. Negative control lanes should not have any visible bands other than free primers.",
    "Note: A faint band higher than the PCR product often appears on the gel after spin-column purification. This should not cause any sequencing problems (samples with this band have been submitted for NGS with no issues in quality). We speculate that the higher band is degraded gDNA that is carried over after purification. However, this DNA will not have the Illumina adapter sequences that were introduced via PCR and therefore will not influence NGS reads.\nNote: The expected band after purification may fall slightly higher than prior to purification on the agarose gel. This is likely due to slight changes in ionic concentration after purification affecting apparent molecular weight and should not provoke any concerns.\nQuantify the purified samples with the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit using manufacturer’s protocol (https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/Qubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf[href=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/Qubit_dsDNA_HS_Assay_UG.pdf]).\nPause Point: Samples can be stored at −20°C for no more than 5 months until ready to submit for NGS."
