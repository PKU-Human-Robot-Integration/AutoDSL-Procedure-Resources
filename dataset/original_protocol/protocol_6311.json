    "Making CD-UPRT expressing stable cellsGenerate CD-UPRT expressing cell line of interest (for example, MDA-MB-231) by transducing cells with CD-UPRT (Addgene) and rtTA3 (Addgene) lentivirus using standard protocol.Labeling of RNA in vitroDay 1Plate 1,000 cells (for example, MDA-MB-231) expressing Doxycycline inducible CD-UPRT (cells of interest) with 1 million 4T1 cells (or other cells (optional)) in 60 mm plates in 3 ml volume (Doxycycline inducible system is optional).Day 2 Add 1 μg/ml Doxycycline.Day 3 24 h post Doxycycline treatment, add 5-FC and thymine to 250 μM (50 mM stock) and 125 μM (25 mM stock) final concentration, respectively. 5-FC and thymine stock solutions are made in PBS. Harvest cells after 2-12 h using cell lysis buffer. Wash the cells 1x with 3 ml PBS before adding 1 ml of cell lysis buffer on the plate. Scrape the cells in 1.5 ml eppendorf tube. Labeling of RNA in miceDay 1 Prepare 500,000/ml CD-UPRT expressing stable cells (described above in A.1) in PBS.Inject 100 μl (50,000 cells) in mouse through tail vein.Day 28 Change the mice diet to Doxycycline diet, 3 days before 5-FC injection, if cells are expressing Doxycycline inducible CD-UPRT. Skip this step if cells are constitutively expressing CD-UPRT.Day 31 Inject the mice with 250 mg/kg 5-FC in PBS (12.5 μg/ml stock) intraperitoneally, and 125 mg/kg thymine in PBS (6.25 μg/ml stock) subcutaneously.After 4-12 h, euthanize the mice by CO2 asphyxiation, harvest the organs, and keep the organ in RNAlater buffer.Put the organ of interest (for example, lungs) in 2 ml cell lysis buffer (Recipe 1) in 5 ml Polystyrene Round-Bottom tube, and homogenize the organ with a tissue grinder.Divide the lysate equally into two tubes and add 3 ml of cell lysis buffer in each tube (The lysate can be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for future use).",
    "Isolation of mRNAAdd 1x volume of cell lysis buffer (4 ml) in the lysate from C.7, rotate at room temperature (RT) for 5 min. For in vitro cells, add appropriate volume of lysis buffer (1 ml for confluent 60 mm plates), and scrape the cells.Put the lysate into 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube/s, and centrifuge at 16, 000 x g for 5 min at RT, and keep supernatant.Prepare oligo dT25 beads (≥ 100 μl beads/~25 mg of lungs/brain).Place 250 μl beads/Eppendorf tube (1.5 ml) in magnetic rack.Remove the storage buffer.Wash the beads 1x with 1 ml cell lysis buffer by pipetting up and down five times.Take out the supernatant (1 ml/250 μl beads) from D.2 and add it to the freshly prepared oligo dT25 beads.Incubate at RT for 10 min in a rotator.Discard the supernatant. Wash the beads 2x with 1 ml mRNA wash buffer I (Recipe 2) at RT by pipetting up and down seven times.Wash the beads 2x with 1 ml mRNA wash buffer II (Recipe 3) at RT by pipetting up and down seven times.Wash the beads 1x with 1 ml mRNA wash buffer III (Recipe 4) at RT by pipetting up and down seven times.Wash the beads 1x with 1 ml TE buffer (Recipe 7) at RT by pipetting up and down seven times.Add 50 μl of Elution buffer (Recipe 5), and elute the RNA in Eppendorf Thermomixer at 85 °C for 2 min shaking at 750 rpm.Place the beads in magnetic rack and keep the Eluate. The mRNA can be stored at -80 °C for future use.Purification of 5-FU tagged mRNAPrepare 70 μl of protein G beads per sample at RT. Place the beads in magnetic rack, and remove the storage buffer. Upto 350 μl (for 5 samples) of beads can be transferred to one 1.",
    "5 ml Eppendorf tube.Wash the beads with 1 ml of 0.5x SSPET buffer (Recipe 6) at RT by pipetting up and down five times.Block the beads with 1 ml of 0.5x SSPET buffer containing 10 μg/ml BSA and 20 μg/ml glycogen for 1 h at 4 °C. Wash the beads 1x with 1 ml of 0.5x SSPET buffer at RT by pipetting up and down five times.Add 35 μl of beads in 750 μl of 0.5x SSPET buffer containing BrdU antibody (1 μg for RT-PCR, and 5 μg for RNA-seq) in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Rotate at 4 °C overnight.Wash the beads 1x with 1 ml of 0.5x SSPET buffer at RT by pipetting up and down five times.Add 35 μl of beads in mRNA (400 μl in this case) from Step D12 diluted with the same volume (400 μl) of 1x SSPET buffer. Total volume will be about 835 μl.Rotate for 2 h using ThermoScientific Rotator at RT.Wash 2x with 1 ml of 0.5x SSPET buffer at RT by pipetting up and down seven times.Wash 2x with 1 ml of 1x SSPET buffer at RT by pipetting up and down seven times.Wash 1x with 1 ml of TE buffer at RT by pipetting up and down seven times.Elute the bound mRNA with 200 μl of 100 μg/ml BrdU in TE buffer in Eppendorf Thermomixer at 900 rpm for 45 min at RT.Keep the supernatant (5-FU tagged mRNA).Mix the 200 μl supernatant with 700 μl of RLT buffer from RNeasy kit.Add 500 μl of 100% ethanol, and mix well.Pass the solution through RNeasy column.Wash 1x with 500 μl of RPE buffer from RNeasy kit.Wash 1x with 500 μl of 80% ethanol.Spin at 13,000 x g for 2 min at RT.Elute the RNA with 200 μl of RNase free water.",

RNAs were labeled as described in Section B, and 5-FU tagged mRNAs were purified as described in Section D and E. Enrichment of 5-FU tagged mRNAs of representative human and mouse genes relative to non immuno-purified mRNA were measured by RT-PCR (Figure 1A).   5 x 104 MDA231-CDUPRT cells were injected in the mouse lungs through tail vein. After 28 days, CD UPRT expression was induced by feeding mice with doxycycline diet for 3 days, and RNA was labeled as described in Section C, and 5-FU tagged mRNA was purified as described in Section D and E. Enrichment of 5-FU tagged mRNAs of representative human and mouse genes relative to non immuno-purified mRNA were measured by RT-PCR (Figure 1B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191114/20191114015648_3074.jpgFigure 1.
