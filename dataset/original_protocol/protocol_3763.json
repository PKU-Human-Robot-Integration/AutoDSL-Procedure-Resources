We recommend seeding cells at 20% confluence to avoid contact inhibition for later stage of cell cycle progression.\nDay 2–3\nRemove the media from 150 mm dish, and wash the cells once with 10 mL prewarmed PBS.\nAdd 20 mL of serum starvation media (DMEM supplemented with 0.2% FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine and 50 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin) to 150 mm dish and keep cells in the incubator for 26 h.\nCritical: To ensure the majority of cells are arrested in G0/G1 after the serum starvation, but meanwhile maintain the ability of cell cycle progression with only a small fraction of cells remaining into G0/G1 after release, we recommend performing optimizations for cell serum starvation; these include optimizing FBS concentration in starvation medium, length of starvation time. Lower FBS concentration and longer serum starvation time increase the number of cells arrested in G0/G1 but also increase the number of cells that will not re-enter the cell cycle remaining in G0. Therefore, it is important to identify for the specific cell line the optimal conditions for serum starvation to achieve a high level of G0/G1 synchronization (>75%-80% cells in G0/G1) and a high percentage of cells going into the S phase after release (>60%–65%). The synchronization-release procedure needs to be validated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/686-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

(Adapted from Wang et al. 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nCell serum starvation release and G2 arrest\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step is used to release cells into S phase followed by a block of cycling cells into G2 phase using CDK1 Inhibitor Ro-3306.\nRemove starvation media and add 20 mL of prewarmed culture media to 150 mm dish.\nCritical: The culture media should be warmed to 37°C before replacing the starvation medium to allow cells progression into S phase without stress (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\n24 h after the release (corresponding to the time needed for the majority of the cells to reach mid-late S phase) add Ro-3306 at a final concentration of 9 μM into the 150 mm dish, and keep cells in the incubator for 16 h to arrest cells in G2.\nEdU/BrdU incorporation and formaldehyde fixation of G2/M cells\nThis step is used to release cells into G2/M, label G2/M DNA synthesis sites with BrdU, and fix cells with formaldehyde.\nTiming: 1.5 h\nRemove the media containing Ro-3306 from 150 mm dish and wash cells 4 times with prewarmed PBS for 5 min.\nPulse cells with both 25 μM EdU (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 μM BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) in fresh prewarmed media for 30 min in the incubator.\nQuickly wash cells once with ice-cold PBS, and incubate the cells with 4 mL trypsin for 10 min in 5% CO2 at 37°C followed by mixing with 10 mL ice-cold regular DMEM to inactivate trypsin.",
    "Critical: During trypsinization, ensure all cells are detached from 150 mm dish checked under microscope to increase cells recovery. Otherwise incubate cells for longer time with trypsin.\nTransfer cells into a 15 mL centrifuge tube (Sarstedt) and pellet the cells by centrifugation at 900 × g, 4°C for 3 min.\nWash cells once with 10 mL ice-cold PBS followed by centrifugation at 900 × g at 4°C for 3 min. After removing the PBS, resuspend the pellet in 1 mL ice-cold PBS and transfer into one 1.5 mL Low DNA Binding tube.\nPellet cells again by centrifugation at 900 × g at 4°C for 3 min followed by formaldehyde fixation and permeabilization for 20 min at 15°C–30°C by gently resuspending cell pellet in 1 mL freshly made PTEMF buffer.\nPellet fixed cells by centrifugation as in step 11 and discard the supernatant.\nWash the fixed cells twice by gently resuspending with 1 mL of ice-cold PBS and keep at 15°C–30°C for 5 min and pellet cells each time by centrifugation at 1000 × g, 4°C for 3 min.\nStore the cells in 1 mL ice-cold PBS at 4°C until use.\nPause Point: Fixed cells in PBS can be kept at 4°C for several days before use.\nNote: We recommend using a centrifuge with swinging-bucket rotors to pellet cells when necessary in this and the following sections to reduce cell loss.",
    "Critical: EdU is not used for the pull-down of DNA synthesis sites, but it is important later during FACS to identify the appropriate population of cells in G2/M performing DNA synthesis and to assess the frequency of G2/M cells performing DNA synthesis. Another positive control for FACS sorting is a population of asynchronous cells pulsed with 25 μM EdU for 30 min, fixed and processed as above, to determine the signal intensity of a large population of cells positive for EdU incorporation (S-phase cells). As a negative control for FACS sorting, an asynchronous population of untreated cells is fixed as above.\nCell sorting by flow cytometry\nTiming: 1 day\nThis step is used to prepare G2/M phase cells for FACS.\nRemove supernatant from fixed cells in step 13 after centrifugation at 1000 × g, 4°C for 3 min, and resuspend the pellet with 600 μL 10% FBS/PBS by gently pipetting.\nIncubate cells in 10% FBS/PBS for 1 h at 15°C–30°C (to reduce non-specific binding of antibodies at later stages of the protocol).\nRemove the 10% FBS/PBS from cells by centrifugation at 1000 × g at 15–30°C for 3 min and resuspend cells with 600 μL 1:2000 diluted rabbit monoclonal anti-Phospho-Histone H3 (pS10-H3) (Cell Signaling Technology) in 1% FBS/PBS, incubating them for 1 h at 15°C–30°C.\nWash cells three times with 800 μL 1% FBS/PBS for 5 min and pellet cells each time by centrifugation at 1000 × g at 15°C–30°C for 3 min.\nAfter the third wash, incubate the cells with 600 μL 1:1000 diluted Alexa Fluor488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 1% FBS/PBS in the dark, for 1 h at 15°C–30°C.",
    "Wash cells three times with 800 μL 1% FBS/PBS for 5 min and pellet cells each time by centrifugation at 1000 × g at 15°C–30°C for 3 min.\nAfter the third wash, gently resuspend the cells in 800 μL 1% FBS/PBS.\nAliquot 100 μL cells to a new DNA Low Binding tube for EdU Click-iT reaction.\nPrepare the Click-iT reaction buffer in the order listed in the table below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_686_11.csv\nRemove the remaining 100 μL 1% FBS/PBS from cells by centrifugation at 1000 × g at 15°C–30°C for 3 min. Resuspend the pellet with 250 μL reaction buffer by gently pipetting and incubate at 15°C–30°C in the dark for 30 min.\nQuickly wash the cells with 1 mL Rinse buffer from the Click-iT Kit by centrifugation at 1000 × g at 15°C–30°C for 3 min.\nRemove most of Rinse buffer and gently resuspend the pellet in 500 μL PBS containing 0.1 mg/mL RNase A and 0.5 μL Vybrant DyeCycle Violet Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transfer the cells to one 5 mL FACS tube for cell cycle analysis (Sample E).\nRemove the remaining 700 μL 1% FBS/PBS from cells by centrifugation at 1000 × g at 15°C–30°C for 3 min. Gently resuspend the pellet in 700 μL PBS containing 0.1 mg/mL RNase A and 0.7 μL Vybrant DyeCycle Violet Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and transfer the cells to one 5 mL FACS tube for sorting according to DNA content and positive pS10-H3 signal (Sample F) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/686-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Gate set for G2/M cells sorting\nRepresentative image of the mitotic cell sorting strategy by FACS. Cells that are both in G2 by DNA content and pS10-H3 positive (highlighted in the box) are sorted followed by BrdU sequencing. (Adapted from Wang et al. 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).",
    "Pause Point: Immunostained cells in PBS should be stored in the dark at 4°C, for up to several days, before cell sorting.\nCritical: For colors compensation a series of controls are required, with cells positive for one dye alone at a time, to determine the range of signal observed in positive and negative cells.\nCells were sorted using a BD FACSAria cell sorter machine (Beckton Dickinson). Samples A-D are used to determine the signal intensities of cells positive and negative for pS10-H3 and in G2/M by DNA content. Once these parameters are identified, a gating is set to specifically select cells positive for both pS10-H3 and G2/M DNA content, so that Sample F can be sorted. Sorting was performed at 15°C–30°C, and cells were collected in a 5 mL FACS tube containing 2 mL of 10% FBS/PBS, to help the collection and centrifugation of the cells later in the protocol (step 26).\nFour samples prepared as control samples are acquired sequentially to determine the signal intensities for each signal and allow for color compensation:\nSample A: half of fixed asynchronous cells grown in one 150 mm dish with around 70% confluency treated with 0.1 mg/mL RNase A and used as a no dye control.\nSample B: half of fixed asynchronous cells grown in one 150 mm dish treated with 0.1 mg/mL RNase A and stained only with 5 μM Vybrant DyeCycle Violet Stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific) to measure signal intensity of violet signal according to the DNA content.",
    "Sample C: around half of fixed asynchronous cells grown in one 150 mm dish were clicked with Alexa Fluor 594 azide following the same steps in 21a except treating the cells only with 0.1 mg/mL RNase A in 500 μL PBS in the last step. This sample is used to measure 594 intensity signals in cells that have incorporated EdU and perform DNA synthesis.\nSample D: a quarter of fixed synchronous cells grown in one 150 mm dish treated with 0.1 mg/mL RNase A and immunostained with pS10-H3 to determine pS10-H3 intensity signal in G2/M cells.\nFollowing color compensation with the single control samples, Sample E is acquired. This will determine the frequency of cells in G2/M performing DNA synthesis, but will also ensure that the gating strategy to select pS10-H3 positive cells is including also cells actively performing DNA synthesis in G2/M (G-MiDS).\nFinally, Sample F with cells labeled for pS10-H3 and DNA content is acquired; cells sorted are gated as from the acquisitions of Samples A-D, according to their positivity to pS10-H3 and G2 DNA content.\nG2/M BrdU-seq\nTiming: 4 days\nThis step is used to purify genomic DNA from G2/M cells collected after sorting (around 30,000 cells) and to prepare immunoprecipitated BrdU labeled G2/M DNA for sequencing.\nDNA purification.\nPellet cells in 5 mL FACS tube by centrifugation at 2800 × g at 15°C–30°C for 10 min. Carefully remove most of the supernatant with around 1 mL remaining in the tube to avoid disrupting the pellets.\nGently resuspend the cell pellet and transfer to 1.5 mL Low DNA Binding tube by using 1 mL tip and pellet the cells by centrifugation at maximum speed at 15°C–30°C for 3 min.",

We recommend leaving some liquid in the tube when discarding the supernatant to reduce loss of cells.\nBrdU-pull down.\nAliquot 10 μL Dynabeads Protein A (Thermo Fisher Scientific) into a 1.5 mL Low DNA Binding tube.",
    "Wash beads twice with 1 mL of 0.5% BSA/PBS/0.1% Tween 20, remove the washed solution by spinning the tube at 400 × g at for 1 min at 15°C–30°C followed by placing it on the Magnet (Thermo Fisher Scientific) until the solution is clear (~ 1 min).\nMix beads with 200 μL 1:150 diluted anti-BrdU antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) in 0.5% BSA/PBS/0.1% Tween 20 and incubate at 4°C for 16–20 h with rotation.\nNote: Prepare beads on the same day as DNA sonication to save time.\nWash beads twice as in step b. After washes, add 10 μL 0.5% BSA/PBS/0.1% Tween 20 to the beads and keep at 4°C until use.\nDilute the purified DNA to 200 μL final volume with TE and denature at 100°C for 10 min. Immediately put the DNA on ice for 5 min. After a quick spin, aliquot 10 μL into a new 1.5 mL Low DNA Binding tube as Input for DNA library construction and store at −20°C until use.\nMix the beads with the remaining 190 μL denatured DNA and 200 μL 2× blocking solution (2% BSA, 2× PBS, 0.2% Tween 20) in DNA low binding tubes, and incubate at 4°C for 16–20 h with rotation.\nAfter immunoprecipitation, wash BrdU-labeled DNA bound to beads twice with 1 mL of lysis buffer 1 (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Sodium Deoxycholate), twice with 1 mL of lysis buffer 2 (50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Sodium Deoxycholate), twice with 1 mL of wash buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.5% Igepal CA-630).",
