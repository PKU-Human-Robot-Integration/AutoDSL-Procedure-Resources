    "Filament constructionPreparing building blocksBinding geometries are defined by pairs of interacting RecA monomers extracted from the RecA crystal structures with PDB codes 2REB (RecA bound to ADP molecules) and 3CMW (RecA bound to ATP and two DNA strands at site I). From each of these structure files, manually extract two neighboring monomers to define the corresponding binding geometry (monomers with different binding geometries are schematized in Figure 2A). In the case of 3CMW, in which binding geometries slightly differ along the 5-monomer filament, select central monomers (position 3 and 4) to avoid possible end effects. Make sure that the two monomers have the same number of residues and are structurally close (RMSD on CA atoms < 3 Å); otherwise, select structurally similar regions using the commands given in reference (Saladin et al., 2009) and Figure 1B. The pair of monomers extracted from the 2REB structure will be denoted RA and RB, and those extracted from 3CMW, CA and CB (Figure 2A). The corresponding new .pdb files should be named RA.pdb, RB.pdb, CA.pdb, CB.pdb (see Note 1).Building blocks are formed by monomer CA (resp. CB) with bound ATP/Mg2+ together with one, two, or three bound DNA segments. To define the DNA segments that are part of the building blocks, proceed as follows: for each of the two strands at site I, extract the three nucleotides that are bound to CA (resp. CB) in the 3CMW structure (the stoichiometry of RecA/DNA association is 3 nucleotides/monomer); note that determination of the residue numbers of the target nucleotides may require visual inspection of the 3CMW structure using VMD. The strand at site II is taken from our model published in Yang et al. (2015) (.pdb file is available upon request): select one RecA monomer and the bound DNA.",
    "Then, using PTools commands (Figure 1B), superpose the RecA monomer onto CA (resp. CB), calculate the transformation matrix associated with the superposition, and apply this transformation matrix to the DNA segment. Finally, for each number of strands, generate a .pdb file, named CA_x.pdb where x = 1, 2, or 3, that contains the CA monomer and its associated ATP molecule, magnesium ion, and DNA segment(s).Assembling building blocksConstruct a 6-monomer filament segment with geometry characteristic to 3CMW using PTools/Heligeom (see Figure 2B) via the command line:$ ptools heligeom -n 6 -o BLOCK1.pdb -Z CA_x.pdb CB_x.pdb In a python script into which the PTools package has been imported, construct the Rigidbody objects corresponding to RA, RB, and BLOCK1 (resp. RA, RB, and BL1). Select chain A of BL1 and store it in a Rigidbody object B1. Select chain F of BL1 and store it in a Rigidbody object B6. Superpose RA onto RB and output the corresponding transformation matrix mat1 (Figure 2A). Apply mat1 onto B6, thereby generating a monomer B7 that adjoins B6 following the binding geometry characteristic to 2REB (Figure 2C). Superpose B1 onto B7 and calculate the transformation matrix mat2 (Figure 2D); apply mat2 onto BL1, thus generating a new 6-monomer filament segment BL2 adjacent to BL1, with the binding geometry between the last unit of BL1 and the first unit of BL2 being 2REB type (Figure 2E and 2F).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4097/bioprotoc-11-14-4097-g002.jpgFigure 2.

(F) Final result (see text in A.2.b). PTools object names are written in blue when used and in red when defined. The process is illustrated in the accompanying video at Figure2_video.mp4[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/doc/upprotocol/p3617/Abstract10_0_20210628080522751/Reca%20Protein%20001.mp4].Refining the junction between building blocksAdjust the interface flexible groups by replacing the N-terminal domain (one helix and associated linker, residues 1 to 37) of Rigidbody B7 with the equivalent region from RA. To this end, create an empty Rigidbody object BL2_adjusted. Select the Cα atoms of residue numbers 38 to 156, 165 to 193, and 213 to 333 of RA (non-flexible regions) and store them in the Rigidbody SRA. Perform the same selection for B7, stored in SB7; superpose SRA onto SB7 and output the transformation matrix mat3. Select the N-terminal domain of RA, residues 1 to 37, and store the selection in NT; store residues 38 to 333 of B7 in CB7; store chains B, C, D, E, and F of BL2 in BL2_BtoF. Apply mat3 to NT and store the result in NT7. Successively concatenate NT7, CB7, and BL2_BtoF to BL2_adjusted; concatenate BL2_adjusted to BL1. Output the structure in PDB format, named FINAL_x.pdb, where x = 1, 2, 3 is the number of DNA strands. Three final structures have now been generated.Process the final structures in such a way as to group the DNA fragments, label them with a specific chain name, group the ATP molecules and change their chain name, and name the protein chains from A to L (Figure 2C, right); replace the ATP/Mg2+ bound to chain F with ADP.",
    "This can be done within the python/PTools script before outputting the .pdb files in the previous paragraph or manually by processing the .pdb files using a text editor.Closing DNA chains with restrained minimization for each file FINAL_x.pdb, x = 1, 2, 3Using Recipe 1, roughly reposition the trinucleotide DNA segment T3F from strand 3 associated with monomer F. This segment presents numerous steric clashes with monomer G following the change in filament axis orientation, consecutive to the modification of the F-G interface geometry. The change in orientation also produces an important rupture of site II continuity between T3F and the DNA segment T3G of strand 3 associated with monomer G.Generate a topology .psf file using the «Automatic PSF builder» VMD extension.Create a constraint file from the FINAL_x.pdb file for NAMD minimization by adding «1.00» to column 62 of the restrained atoms (P for the DNA chains and CA for proteins); the script given as Recipe 2 below can be used to this end. The resulting file FINAL_x_cstr.pdb needs to be modified in order to free the phosphate atoms situated at the junction between chains F and G for energy minimization, where the helix symmetry has been broken, by replacing «1.00» with «0.00» for these specific phosphate atoms (three phosphate atoms are freed per DNA chain).Perform 5000 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization using NAMD2.10. This enables closure of the DNA backbones by restoring the distances between covalently linked atoms according to the topology file and releasing small steric clashes if any.Stability and evolution of the filament model: molecular dynamics simulationsSimulation preparation for each file FINAL_x.pdb, x = 1, 2, 3Immerse the structure in a water box using the VMD extension «Add Solvation Box»; use a TIP3P water model and a box padding value of 10 Â.",
    "Add Na+ and Cl- ions to the water box using the VMD extension «Add Ions»; select the option «Neutralize and set NaCl concentration to 0.15 mol/L».Simulation runs for each of the three systems using NAMD2.10Given the large size of the systems (about 450,000 atoms), this step needs to be performed on distributed computer nodes, for example, in a computer center. The simulation follows standard NAMD protocols.Simulation conditions: use the CHARMM 27 force field including CMAP corrections; use periodic boundary conditions, with the particle mess Ewald method to account for long range interactions and a smooth switch of van der Waals interactions between 10 and 12 Å; set time steps to 2 fs using the SHAKE algorithm; control the temperature and pressure using a Langevin dynamics scheme and a Nose-Hoover Langevin piston.Simulation run: perform 5000 steps of conjugate gradient minimization followed by a progressive heating stage up to 300K, a long equilibration phase of 30 ns, and a 100 ns production phase. During heating and equilibration, set restraints on the P and CA atoms of the files, with the force constant decreasing from 0.5 to 0.05 kcal·mol-1·Å-2. Do not use restraints during the production phase. Perform three independent simulations for the three-stranded system using identical conditions."
