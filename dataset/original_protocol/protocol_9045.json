    "1. Generation of Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Aggregates (D1-D4)\nHuman pluripotent stem cells are cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeders in the presence of hESC medium supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, 4 ng/ml). After 5-7 days in culture, when the colonies are big but still undifferentiated, they are ready for the next step.\nThe enzyme solution should first be prepared. In a 50 ml tube, dissolve the dispase (or collagenase) at a 1 mg/ml concentration into DMEM/F12 medium. Since these solutions mix best when warmed, place the tube containing the medium and enzyme into a 37 °C water bath for 10-15 min and then sterilize it using a Steriflip filter.\nAspirate off the medium from the cells, rinse them with DMEM/F12, and aspirate this off as well. Add 1 ml of dispase to each well and place in the incubator for 3-5 min for hESCs (up to 10 min for iPSCs). Look at the cells under the microscope; when the edges curl up slightly/look a bit darker, the cells are ready for the next step. It is best to check the cells after 3 min and put them back in if necessary. When using this protocol for the first time, it is best to start with only one plate of cells at a time as it is important to remove the cells from the dispase as quickly as possible.\nAspirate off the dispase from the cells. Gently (the cells are very vulnerable at this stage and will come off of the plate relatively easily) add 1.5 ml of DMEM/F12 medium to each well in order to rinse off the dispase. Aspirate off the DMEM/F12 and add 1.5 ml of hESC medium to each well.",
    "To detach and break up the cells, place the tip of a 10 ml glass pipette towards the bottom right hand corner of a well (touching the cells) and move the pipette up and down (vertically) - the upward stoke should be in close proximity to the proceeding downward stroke. Once the other side of the well is reached, repeat in the horizontal direction.\nOnce all of the cells are in suspension, place them in 15 ml tubes and centrifuge them at 200 x g for 2 min. There should be a pellet of cells at the bottom of the tube. Aspirate off the medium from above the pellet.\nThe size of the cell culture flask that should be utilized to keep the aggregates in depends upon the original quantity of cells. For 6 wells (1 plate) of hESCs, one non-tissue culture treated T75 flask with 50 ml of hESC medium should be utilized. Transfer the cells from step 1.6 to the flask and incubate at 37 °C.\nIn order to get rid of the cell debris, the cell medium and flask should be replaced approximately 12 hr later. To do this, place all of the medium/cells into a 50 ml tube, spin the cells down (200 x g for 2 min), and aspirate off the old medium. Next, add 50 ml of fresh hESC medium to the cells, and place into a new T75 flask. The cells can then be fed daily following this same procedure (until day 5).\n2. Induction of Neuroepithelial Cells (D5-D17)\nTransfer the cells/medium to a 50 ml tube, and centrifuge the cells for 2 min at 200 x g. Next, aspirate off the supernatant, and transfer the cells to a new (non-tissue culture treated) T75 flask with 50 ml of neural induction medium (NIM).",
    "Once the cells are in NIM, half of the medium should be replaced every other day. The aggregates should become large enough to where they will sink to the bottom of a 50 ml conical tube on their own after a few minutes (no centrifugation required). After 2-3 days in NIM (D7-D8 total), the cells should be ready to plate. Laminin or fetal bovine serum (FBS) can be utilized to help the cells attach to the plates.\nThe number of tissue culture treated 6 well plates that are needed depends upon the density of the cells as each aggregate should be able to grow on the plate for several more days without touching any of the others. On average, the cells from one T75 flask will yield about 4-6 6 well plates worth of cells.\nIf using laminin, dilute it in NIM to 10-20 μg/ml to coat the 6-well plate (~0.5 ml/well). After coating for 2-3 hr, plate cell aggregates onto 6-well plates (~20-30 aggregates per well). After the aggregates have attached, add 1.5 ml of NIM.\nIf using FBS, prepare a mixture of 90% NIM and 10% FBS (1.5 ml/well). Add 1.5 ml of medium with the cells to each well, gently shake the plate back and forth to spread out the aggregates, and allow the cells to attach O/N in an incubator. Be sure to change the medium (2 ml/well of NIM) the following morning to remove the FBS.",
    "After a day or two of being plated, each aggregate will spread out to form a monolayer. Within a couple of days, the centers of most of these cells will morphologically appear similar to columnar cells (elongated). During this period, change the NIM every other day. Some PSC lines (especially iPSC), may form columnar cells less efficiently. If this happens, the addition of BMP and TGF inhibitors (Dorsomorphin29, SB43154219 at 2 μM) during stage 2 can be helpful.\nAround days 14-17, the columnar cells will appear more compact. Sometimes these cells form ridges or rings with visible lumen inside. Besides the columnar morphology, cells at this stage express neuroepithelial markers, such as PAX6 and SOX112,26.\nBefore the isolation can begin, one must first examine the cells to determine if there are any non-neuroepithelial cells present. An objective marker can be utilized to indicate the non-neuroepithelial colonies. These can then be eliminated by scraping them off with a pipette tip.\n3. Generation of Telencephalic Progenitors (D17-D24)\nThe centers of the colonies contain the neuroepithelial cells, and should be isolated from the rest of the colony. This can be done using a micropipette and a sterile 1 ml filtered pipette tip. When a small amount of pressure is applied to the center portion of the colony, it generally lifts off quite readily. Be cautious to not let the outer portion of the colony detach as well. If the centers are being stubborn and will not come off on their own, they can be removed by excising them using a needle under a microscope in a sterile hood. Transfer the center portions of the colonies to a 15 ml tube and spin at 200 x g for 2 min.",
    "The medium should be aspirated off of the cells. Two plates worth of cells can then be transferred to a non-tissue culture treated T25 flask containing 10 ml of NIM with the addition of B27 (without vitamin A, 1:50). Use 5-10 ml of medium per one plate of cells.\nWhen the cells are viewed the following day, they should have a sphere like appearance. It is necessary to transfer these cells into a new flask (in the presence of NIM and B27, 1:50) as it is often the peripheral cells which sneak in and attach to the bottom of the flask.\nThe neurospheres should then be cultured in suspension for one week using NIM supplemented with B27 (1:50). In order to promote cell endurance and proliferation, cyclic AMP (cAMP, 1 μM) as well as insulin growth factor (IGF1, 10 ng/ml) can be added into the medium during suspension culture. At this point, the neurospheres contain telencephalic progenitors (FOXG1+) and are ready to be plated onto coverslips for terminal differentiation.\n4. Further Differentiation into the Telencephalic Neurons (D25+)\nPrepare the poly-ornithine/laminin coated coverslips (in 24-well plates) for plating the cells. Coverslips are first cleaned, and are then coated with ploy-ornithine (at 0.1 mg/ml, 37 °C, O/N, and stored in the freezer).\n Poly-ornithine coating: \nSterilize the coverslips: Place the coverslips in a beaker containing nitric acid and gently shake in the fume hood for one hour. Pour out the nitric acid, rinse several times with DI water, and leave the coverslips under running DI water for at least 15 min. Place the coverslips in 95% ethanol and either shake for 30 min (if using immediately) or store in ethanol at RT.",
    "In a sterile hood, pour out the contents of the 50 ml tube containing sterilized coverslips into the lid of a 6-well plate. Using sterilized forceps, pick up one coverslip at a time and set upright in a single well of a 24-well plate. Repeat so that each well has a coverslip.\nAfter they dry completely, tap the plates until coverslips have fallen flat in each well. Next add 100 μl poly-ornithine (0.1 mg/ml in sterile dH2O) to each coverslip and incubate the plates O/N at 37 °C.\nThe next day, remove plates from the incubator and allow them to cool to RT. Aspirate poly-ornithine off of each coverslip (from the edge of the coverslip) making sure not to touch or scratch the coverslips in the process. Allow the coverslips to dry for approximately 30 min before washing.\nAdd 1 ml sterile dH2O to each well, let sit for 10 min, and aspirate off the water from each well. Repeat this wash step two more times. After the plates dry completely, (leave covers off in the hood) place the lids on, cover with aluminum foil, and store at -20 °C.\nTo coat the coverslips with laminin, add 50 μl of a mixture of neural differentiation medium and laminin (final concentration of 20 μg/ml) to each poly-ornithine treated coverslip being careful to only have the liquid touching the coverslip itself (and not spilling off). Incubate them at 37 °C for 1-2 hr before preparing the cells for attachment.\nCollect and centrifuge the neurospheres at 200 x g for 2 min in a 15 ml tube. Aspirate off the supernatant.\nRinse the cells with DMEM-F12 and centrifuge the cells again. If the neurospheres are too large to attach properly, they can be dissociated with Accutase at this step.",
    "If using Accutase: After washing the cells with DMEM-F12, the neurospheres are dissociated to small clusters by adding Accutase (~2 ml) and incubating the cells at 37 °C for 3 min. Next, add the same amount of trypsin inhibitor (~2 ml) and centrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 3 min. The cells should then be re-suspended in NDM and broken using a P200 pipette. The small clusters can then be plated onto pre-coated coverslips.\nAspirate off the majority of the medium and place the cells onto a 6 cm Petri dish in a few drops of the medium so that selecting them becomes easier. Add about 4-5 neurospheres to each pre-coated coverslip. There is no need to aspirate off the laminin first.\nLet the neurospheres attach for at least 2-4 hr. Once they have attached well, more medium (0.5 ml/coverslip) should be added. It should consist of neural differentiation medium supplemented with B27 (1:50), cAMP (1 μM), and neurotrophic factors (BDNF, GDNF, and IGF, all at 10 ng/ml). At this point half of the medium can be changed every other day and these cells can be maintained for several months.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
