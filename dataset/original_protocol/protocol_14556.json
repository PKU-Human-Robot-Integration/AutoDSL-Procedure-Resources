    "This protocol and the experiments reported in the video were approved by the LSUHSC-S Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and are in compliance with the guidelines of NIH.\nNOTE: Male C57BL/6 mice weighing 25 - 29 g were used in this study. The mice were maintained on a standard chow pellet diet with free access to water, under a 12 hr light/dark cycle in individually ventilated cages. The procedure will be performed under sterile conditions using sterile techniques (e.g., sterile gloves, sterile instruments).\n1. Pre-surgical Preparations\nInduce anesthesia using a combination of ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally (i.p.). Monitor depth of anesthesia by foot pinch initially every 3 - 5 min and every 10 min once anesthesia is achieved. While the animal is under anesthesia, administer a sterile ocular ointment to prevent dryness. The initial dose of ketamine/xylazine usually lasts about 30-40 minutes.  An additional dose can be administered if needed, which is verified by the animal’s response to a foot pinch.\nPlace mice in a supine position on a temperature regulated heat mat and maintain body temperature at 36.5 ± 0.1 °C, which is verified using a rectal probe.\nShave the neck and disinfect the skin with 70% ethyl alcohol. \n2. Occlusion of the MCA (Figure 1)\nMake a midline neck incision using Iris straight scissors and retract (using retractors) the soft tissues to expose the vessels.\nDissect the CCA and the ECA from surrounding tissue using Dumont forceps without damaging the vagus nerve.\nMake a temporary suture by tying a loose knot around the CCA using 6-0 silk.\nMake a permanent suture around the ECA and the smaller vessels extending from it by tightly ligating the vessels (distal to the bifurcation of the CCA).",
    "Make a suture around the ECA proximal to the CCA bifurcation.\nPlace a microvessel clip around the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the pterygopalatine artery (PPA).\nMake a small incision in the ECA using micro dissecting spring scissors and insert a 180 μm silicon-tipped monofilament. Make the cut as close to the permanent suture as possible for easier manipulation of the filament.\nTighten the temporary suture around the ECA with the filament inserted and remove the microvessel clip.\nCut the ECA between the permanent, distal suture and the entry point of the filament using micro dissecting spring scissors.\nGuide the filament through the ICA until resistance is felt (approx. 9 - 10 μm beyond the bifurcation of the CCA) in the MCA.\n\tNOTE: In the event too much resistance is felt while the majority of the filament is still visible, the filament may have entered the PPA. If this happens, pull the filament back to the bifurcation, gently push forward into the ICA using Dumont forceps, and advance the filament until it can be visualized in the ICA.\n3. Reperfusion\nAfter a 30-min occlusion period, remove the filament by gently pulling it back using Dumont forceps and secure the suture around the open end of the ECA.\nRemove the temporary suture around the CCA by carefully loosening the ligature using Dumont forceps and blood flow is resumed through the CCA.\nClose the incision with a continuous surgical suture. Closure of the skin can be accomplished by either continuous or interrupted sutures.  Skin staples are also an acceptable method.",
    "Inject mice with 1 ml of saline subcutaneously as volume replenishment and with the analgesic carprofen (5 mg/Kg, s.c.) for relief of pain and discomfort from the surgical procedure, Signs that indicate additional pain relief is needed include hunched back, ungroomed coat, decreased activity, abnormal posturing, and decreased appetite.\nObserve mice throughout the recovery from the anesthesia in a heated 30 °C cage using a heat lamp regulated using a temperature controller and place mashed chow in a petri dish on the floor of the cage to encourage eating. The mice will be housed one per cage during the reperfusion period.\n4. Sham Surgery\nSubject mice to the same procedure without the monofilament insertion.\n5. Post-operative Neurological Scores (Table 1; Figure 2)\nNeurologically evaluate mice after the appropriate reperfusion period using an 18-point scoring system assessing the General; Motor; Sensory; Proprioception. A higher neurological score corresponds to decreased neurological function.\n\tNOTE: Mice that are judged unresponsive and unable to walk will be euthanized. Other criteria for humane euthanasia will include a weight loss of greater than 20%, respiratory distress, and infection around the surgical area. A CO2 chamber will be used for euthanasia and the physical method to confirm death will be cervical dislocation or thoracotomy.\n6. Measurement of Brain Infarct Volume (Figure 3)\nInduce anesthesia using a combination of ketamine (150 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) injected i.p. Monitor depth of anesthesia by foot pinch initially every 3 - 5 min and every 10 min once anesthesia is achieved.\nPlace mice in a supine position and cut the skin from the abdomen to the neck followed by the peritoneum using iris straight scissors.\nLift up the sternum using Dumont forceps and cut the ribs to expose the heart.",
    "Open the left and the right side of the chest using two pairs of hemostats, exposing the heart.\nInsert a 26 G needle attached to a 5 ml syringe into the left ventricle and cut the right atrium. Perfuse with room temperature normal saline or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) until the fluid becomes clear (usually 3 - 5 min).\nRemove the skull carefully away from the brain using iris straight scissors and Dumont forceps.\nCut off the olfactory bulbs and the cerebellum using a razor blade so that the brain will fit in the matrix. Use this matrix to slice the brain into even segments. Chill the matrix before use to keep the tissue cool. Place the brain into the matrix and set it on ice.\nSlice the brain into 2 mm coronal segments using two razor blades. Make the first cut using a razor blade beginning 2 mm from the top and leave this razor blade in place. Make another 2 mm cut behind the first. Remove the first razor blade with the tissue attached. Repeat this process until all tissue has been sliced.\n\tNOTE: There should be 4 - 5 segments when finished.\nPlace the segments into 24-well plate containing 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazalium chloride (TTC), which is then placed in a shallow water bath at 37 °C for 20 min. Placing each segment into an individual well helps to keep them in the order in which they were cut. Ensure that the TTC solution completely covers the tissue segments. After 10 min turn all the slices over.\nPlace a small amount of 10% formalin into the wells of a new 24-well plate and transfer the segments to this plate in the order in which they were cut.",
    "Scan the segments into the computer and analyze the infarct size as a percentage of the whole brain slice6 using ImageJ analysis software (NIH 1.57 Image Software)6.\n\t\nOutline the infarcted area to generate an area measurement. Next measure the entire contralateral hemisphere to determine the area. Divide the infarct area by the area of the contralateral hemisphere and multiply by 100 to determine the infarct volume.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
