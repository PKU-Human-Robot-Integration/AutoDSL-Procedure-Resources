    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nLoad Cell Calibration\nTiming: 1 h\nLoad cells are calibrated by installing them into our custom-designed calibration device and then applying increasing forces on the load cell using known masses. We use increasing amounts of sucrose or water in a lightweight container. The amplified analog force signal from the load cells is recorded as a voltage by the acquisition hardware. The corresponding voltage signals from each known mass can then be plotted to determine the force-to-voltage relationship. The calibration device is designed to determine the force-to-voltage relationship for forces applied bidirectionally to the load cells.\nCritical: The load cells only need to be calibrated once. This needs to be done before the installation of the load cell into the head-fixation system.\nInstall the load cell into the calibration device. See above for assembly instructions.\nConnect the circuit output to an analog recording device. Our lab uses Blackrock data acquisition systems, but we have also used National Instruments data acquisition cards. For calibration, a high-resolution voltage meter is also sufficient (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/169-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Equipment Needed to Calibrate Load Cells\nAny voltage meter can be used that detects the voltage of the circuit output. For example, Blackrock systems can also be used. Note the calibration device currently has a load applied to the load cell, which is registering a voltage of 3.9 V.\nSet the force-to-voltage slope for each circuit.\nThe INA125 amplification chip is connected to a multi-turn trimmer potentiometer between pins 8 and 9. The potentiometer should be adjusted while monitoring the signal in real time, as the neutral set point voltage of the load cell will change.",
    "Turning the potentiometer changes the slope of the relationship between the applied force and the corresponding voltage. Counter clock-wise rotation (reducing resistance) will increase the slope and clock-wise rotation (increasing resistance) will reduce the slope (Hughes et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). The resistance should be adjusted so the mice cannot max out the voltage signal in either direction. At the same time, the range should also be calibrated for maximum sensitivity. Thus, a good balance of sensitivity and resolution needs to be found through trial-and-error. The range of the signal can be tested by gently moving the calibration platform up and down, producing a sinusoidal signal.\nFull-grown mice readily produce instantaneous force amplitudes exceeding 1 N. Making sure that a 100 g mass placed on the calibration platform does not max out the signal can help determine the optimal potentiometer position.\nWe have found that the potentiometer resistance value should be around 100 ohms for a good signal range. With lower resistance values, the conversion function can become non-linear with more extreme forces.\nCalibrate each load cell circuit.\nApply increasing masses (e.g., 25 g, 50 g, 100 g) one at a time to the platform of the calibration device and record the voltage signal that results at the circuit output. Keep using greater masses until the signal has reached the end of its range.\nCritical: The actual applied mass is equal to the mass of the applied object plus the mass of the weighing platform itself.\nFlip the device over and repeat with the other side.\nIf the load cell’s signal saturates with a mass lower than 100g, adjust the potentiometer, and then repeat step 4.\nCalculate the voltage-to-force linear function.",
    "The applied force from each mass can be calculated using Newton’s second law (force = mass x acceleration). We assume a constant acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s2).\nDetermine the linear function for converting the recorded voltage from the load cell to force. It is useful to first plot the voltage vs. applied force data to confirm a linear relationship. Next, invert the relationship, plotting force vs. voltage and fit a line to the points to determine the slope and the y-axis intercept (see below for further clarification, Figure 14[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig14]). Because the load cell’s signal should be linear, applying the function to any voltage value results in an accurate force estimate.\nRepeat steps 4 & 5 for each load cell (x5).\nInstall the load cells into the head-fixation device (see previous section on head-fixation device assembly).\nMake sure that the load cells are oriented in the device in such a way that the directions of the signals are known and intuitive. For example, it is helpful for analysis and interpretation that forward movements increase the voltage signal and backward movements decrease the signal.\nIt is helpful for troubleshooting to label the individual wires that connect the circuit board to each load cell as well as to the data acquisition system. This allows you to easily find the appropriate connections.\nKeep track of the analog input channel that each load cell signal is being routed to in the recording system. Labeled wires make this simple and clear.\nCritical: The load cell should not be used if either non-linearities or slope differences between the two load directions are encountered. These make any simple linear force-voltage transformation more difficult, if not impossible.",
    "Critical: The conversion function should remain stable indefinitely if the trim potentiometer setting does not change and if the load cell does not become permanently deformed from excessive force. If this is done properly, the calibration step only needs to be performed once prior to final head-fixation device assembly.\nSolutions for Long-Term Stability and Protection of Wiring\nTiming: 1 h\nThe final assembly of the head-fixation system results in many delicate wires arranged around the mouse. Proper planning and organization of the wiring protects the system from accidental snagging and jostling. Damage can naturally result from installing and removing the animals as well as from their natural movements during experimentation. Here we provide some suggestions for ways to protect the wiring and circuits.\nThe amplifier and trim potentiometer can be protected by soldering them together on a small circuit prototyping breadboard. (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]; see (Hughes et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) for wiring diagram).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/169-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Custom-Built Circuit with Trimmer Potentiometer\nThis circuit is made using the through-pin version of the amplifying chip (INA125P). See (Hughes et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) for a full circuit diagram.\nThe circuit boards should be kept some distance away from the head-fixation device to prevent them from being bumped, jostled, or soiled. We have found that it is helpful to place the circuit boards in small modified plastic containers that you can put in the corner of the operant box (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Used pipette tip boxes work well.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/169-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Enclosure to Protect Circuit Wiring\nNot shown are holes cut in the side of the enclosure to allow for passage of wiring.",
    "We have made custom printed circuit boards that work with surface mount variants of the amplifier and trimmer potentiometers. The boards are meant to replace the hand- assembled circuits to reduce assembly error. In our design, all five circuits can be conveniently arranged on one board (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/169-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Optional Printed Circuit Board Containing Five Circuits with Surface Mount Components for Each Load Cell\nThe printed circuit board is an alternative solution to wiring separate circuits by hand for each load cell. Inset shows zoomed in view of one circuit module. The circuit components are soldered by hand. Note that the amplifying chip used here is the surface mount version (INA125UA), as is the potentiometer.\nNote: One limitation with some surface mount potentiometers is that they are not multi-turn, meaning that it may be difficult to dial in the right resistance for the optimal signal sensitivity. We have not experimented with multi-turn surface mount potentiometers.\nThe load cells have very delicate wires. We recommend permanently attaching the wires to the plastic components of the head-fixation device. We also have begun to use male and female pin connectors that are glued to the 3D-printed structure components (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). This approach also makes for easy disconnection if the system must be removed for repair or cleaning.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/169-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Load Cells Connected to Circuit with Male-to-female Connector Pins for Easy Disassembly\nWe recommend attaching these connectors with super glue to the base support and curved support pieces of the head-fixation system.",
    "The wiring of the loadcells installed under the animals’ feet exit out the back of the perch (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]). As a result, these wires can be easily damaged by movements that occur during the task, as well as when you install the mice into the perch. They should be routed down and to the sides of perch stand to keep them protected and immobile.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/169-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Rear-View of Behavioral Perch Showing the Routing and Protection of the Load Cell Wiring from the Foot Force Sensors\nWires in the back of the perch are the most prone to damage from normal movements. Route these wires around the sides of the perch.\nImplanting and Preparing Mice with Optogenetic and Electrophysiological Equipment in the VTA\nTiming: 4 h\nRecording from VTA DA neurons can be a difficult and tedious process. However, there are some useful tips that can help you increase the yield.\nCritical: Even with good surgical technique, DA neurons often will not be immediately detectable when using chronic electrode implants. In these cases, being patient and simply waiting long enough after surgery often results in obtaining good DA neurons.\nPrepare mice for surgery.\nAdditional surgical preparation procedures can be found in (Geiger et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nSterilize surgical instruments using an autoclave or dry bead sterilizer. Animals are initially anesthetized with isoflurane (2%–3%) mixed with oxygen flowing at 0.5 L/min.\nOnce installed in the stereotaxic device, animals are maintained during surgery using 0.8% to 1.5% isoflurane in 0.5 L/min oxygen.\nMaintain animal body temperature using a thermoregulating heating pad.\nShave hair over the entire scalp using electric clippers and clean the shaved areas with iodine and 70% isopropyl alcohol.\nCover the eyes with ophthalmic ointment for protection.\nDeliver a subcutaneous injection of meloxicam (2 mg/kg) for preemptive analgesia.",
    "Level the head and determine the location of the craniotomy.\nTent the skin over the scalp by pulling it gently using sterile forceps. Cut the skin with sterile surgical scissors so that the scalp is exposed. The resulting incision should be about 10 mm in diameter.\nClean the bone surface with hydrogen peroxide to remove periosteal tissue, then rinse with sterile 0.9% saline and dry it with Gelfoam.\nFix a sturdy vertical coordinate probe (such as a syringe tip or a spare optical fiber implant) to the stereotaxic arm and ensure it travels consistently along the entire exposed sagittal suture of the skull in the anterior-posterior axis.\nThis ensures that the skull is centered in the apparatus.\nIf the probe and suture deviate, adjust the ear bar positions to correct the deviation.\nLocate lambda and bregma (See methods from Paxinos and Franklin, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] for useful suggestions on determining these landmarks).\nEnsure that lambda and bregma are level by moving the probe to both positions and making note of the dorsal-ventral coordinate at each landmark. We aim for a difference of less than 100 μm.\nPerform a small craniotomy over the VTA and four additional craniotomies for skull screws.\nWe use the following coordinates to target the VTA relative to bregma: AP: −3.3 mm, ML: 0.5 mm for the center of the craniotomy (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9] left).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/169-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Craniotomy Targeting for the VTA Electrode Implantation and Locations of Bone Screws around Perimeter of Exposed Skull\nLeft: Coordinate probe is used to level the head and determine the location of the craniotomy relative to bregma. Right: Screws are implanted around the edges of the exposed skull where it is thickest. This electrode does not have an optical fiber attachment. Reference wire is wrapped around one screw.",
    "The size and location of the craniotomy will depend on the size of the electrode array.\nDrivable electrodes that we use have recording wires bundled in a cannula that is 200 μm in diameter and require the smallest craniotomy.\nCritical: Take caution when using larger electrode arrays. Avoid implanting them too close to the midline. Mice have a higher mortality rate when this is done due to the increased risk of rupturing the sagittal sinus.\nImplant several miniature screws (4 are recommended) along the lateral portions of the front and back of the skull, forming roughly a square (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9], right). The bone is thicker further from the midline as well as near the cerebellum. The headcap can stay fixed to the skull for over a year even with regular head-fixation experiments.\nTurn the screws 2–3 times, so that the first or second complete thread has cut into the bone. Inserting the screw beyond this point only damages the brain and does not improve its stability in the skull.\nIf you are unsure of how well the screw is fastening to the skull, take some tweezers and try to lightly wiggle the screw. If it does not move, it is well fastened. However, if it does, unscrew it from the skull and make a new craniotomy.\nPosition the electrode just above the craniotomy. Ground the electrode by wrapping the refence wire around only one dental screw.\nWrap the reference wire around the screw 4–5 times, then turn the screw by ½ a turn so the ground wire becomes tightly wrapped around the screw.\nGood grounding is important for optimal neural activity with a good signal-to- noise ratio.",
    "Excessive bleeding under the screw may form a clot between the metal and the brain surface, which will worsen grounding. It is advised to use a flat-bottomed screw for the reference to minimize clotting.\nRemove any additional wiring by cutting the remaining wire coming off the skull screw.\nCritical: Be sure to wrap the reference wire around the screw before implanting the electrode. Otherwise, wrapping the wire around the screw while it is in the brain will move the electrode, which can cause significant damage to brain tissue.\nSlowly lower the electrode array into the VTA.\nInitially lower the electrode in 500 μm steps. Between each advance of the electrode, wait 2–3 min, then lower another 500 μm.\nApproximately 1 mm above the VTA (2.8–3.0 mm from brain surface), begin to lower the electrode in 100 μm steps. After each increment, stop and wait 2–3 min. Lowering the electrode array too rapidly will affect your yield of DA neurons.\nStop anywhere between (dorsal-ventral) 3.9 - 4.5 mm from brain surface.\nIf using a drivable electrode, we recommend stopping the cannulae just above the VTA around 3.8 mm.\nSee also (Coddington and Dudman, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). They were able to optically tag DA neurons as shallow as 3.6 mm and as deep as 4.9 mm. We have not attempted to record from these more extended coordinates.\nCritical: Lowering the electrode slowly, especially for the final millimeter, is essential for high-quality recordings with a good signal-to-noise ratio.\nPosition the head-restraint implant around the electrode and apply dental cement around both to secure them in place for chronic recording (Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/169-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Release of a Drivable Optical Electrode after Application of Dental Cement",
    "Left: Release of a cemented drivable optrode targeting the VTA. Right: View from the front along with the head bar embedded into the cement.\nNote: Different head-restraint implants are often used in individual labs to accommodate for different recording hardware needs. Our restraint bars are custom made by a machine shop.\nRemove the animal from the stereotaxic device and place them in a clean cage.\nPlace the cage on a heating pad for recovery.\nCritical: After an implantation of an electrode array, we often will wait up to several months before viable DA neurons can be observed. If no DA neurons appear at first, e.g., if the electrode contains neurons that cannot be optogenetically tagged or do not have a characteristic DA waveform, wait and recheck neural activity after several weeks.\nRecording Force and Neural Signals from Behaving Animals\nTiming: 1 h\nThe device requires an acquisition system that can record a minimum of five analog voltage signals in parallel. Our lab uses Blackrock Cerebus systems. These systems can record neural data in parallel with analog behavioral data and digital time stamps such as laser events or licking time stamps.\nNote: We use two computers for our experimental system. One computer controls the behavioral tasks using MATLAB via a small data acquisition (DAQ) system (National Instruments). The DAQ outputs cue, reward, and laser stimulation commands that are copied to the digital inputs of the Blackrock Cerebus recording system. The second computer records all the neural, analog, and digital timestamp data via the Blackrock system. In this design, all experimental manipulations, as well as the neural and behavioral data from the animal, are saved onto one system for ease of analysis.",
    "Critical: We recommend using an all-in-one system for recording neural and force data. However, many neural recording acquisition systems are unable to accommodate many analog inputs. It is possible to use other systems for recording the analog signals, such as acquisition cards from National Instruments. If recording neural data and load cell force data on separate devices, it is essential to be able to synchronize the two systems in some manner.\nSet up the recording system and software.\nEnsure cues and rewards are being delivered correctly.\nWhen running optogenetic experiments, check the power output from the laser and confirm that the behavioral program is correctly outputting the proper frequency of stimulation.\nPrepare data recording hardware.\nEnter file name for saving.\nAlso prepare head stages and optical stimulation hardware.\nDouble check force sensors are working properly.\nGently push on the pivot point of the head-fixation system where the head force sensors are located.\nBlackrock systems make this step easy, as it is possible to observe all of the analog signals together using the “raster plot” window found on the control panel of the Blackrock recording software suite (Central) and selecting the appropriate analog channels. This will provide a real-time read out of the voltage signals from the load cells.\nGently push on the foot platforms to check the feet force sensors.\nInstall mice in the head-fixation system.\nThe perch that the mice sit in has a cover. Mice will learn to walk forward under the cover to the front side with the head-restraint attachments. We deliver a small reward they can collect once they walk through. Do not try to force them through the perch. They will naturally approach the front. This is also much easier than trying to back the mice into the system.",
    "Optical fibers and recording head stages should only be attached after the mice are head-restrained.\nAnimals should be positioned so that they are comfortably resting on the floor of the mouse perch. The head should not be too high or too low relative to the floor. The mice will often use their forepaws to pull against the edges of the perch (Figures 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11] and 12[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig12]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/169-Fig11.jpg\nFigure 11. Wide View of a Mouse Installed in the Head-Fixation System\nNote mouse positioning and the generous space afforded to accommodate various recording hardware.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/169-Fig12.jpg\nFigure 12. Close-Up View of Optimal Mouse Positioning\nNote the forepaws are able to reach the edge of the perch.\nWhen first putting the mouse on the platform, perform a quick visual check that the loadcell signal baselines are at neutral values and that it is possible to obtain equal measures of movement in both directions for each load cell. It is possible that adding or removing the animal can shift the load cells slightly, cause an offset from a neutral position, or damage wiring.\nComplete experiment and stop recording signals.\nRemove fiber optic cables or head stages.\nLoosen the head-restraint clamps and simply allow the mouse to walk onto one’s hand.\nOptional: To keep the device in good working condition, clean up the perch between experiments. However, we have not noticed any impact on behavior by training animals consecutively in the device without cleaning. We clean at the end of the day by vacuuming droppings.\nOptically Tagging DA Neurons\nTiming: 10 min\nDA neurons can be optically tagged if the DA neurons express ChR2. Light can then be delivered to the recording site immediately adjacent to the tips of the electrode. Ensure that the laser is connected to the optic fiber implant before beginning.",
    "We normally attempt to tag DA neurons at the end of the experiment.\nStop the behavioral programs, but do not stop recording neural signals.\nActivate the laser and initiate the stimulation.\nWe use 10-20 5 ms pulses at 10–20 Hz delivered for 1 second. Each pulse train istriggered every 5–15 seconds for 20 total trials. Use a random inter-trial-interval to keep animals from anticipating the stimulation.\nOnce laser stimulation is completed, stop recording the neural signals and remove the mouse.\nSee (Hughes et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) for examples of optically tagged neurons.\nCritical: Save any spiking evoked by optical tagging in the same file that contains the neural activity recorded during the behavioral session. This allows spontaneously evoked and stimulation- evoked spikes to be sorted together, and will greatly aid in both identifying DA neurons and connecting them to activity recorded during the experiment."
