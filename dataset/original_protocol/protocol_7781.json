    "Rice seeds were surface sterilized with 10% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide for 30 min and then rinsed thoroughly with deionized water.The sterilized seeds were germinated on plastic supporting netting (mesh of 1 mm2) mounted in plastic containers for 1 week in a growth room with a 16-h-light (30 °C)/8-h-dark (22 °C) photoperiod, and the relative humidity was controlled at approximately 70%. Uniform seedlings were selected and then transferred to IRRI nutrient solution. Rice seedlings were grown in IRRI nutrient solution for 2 weeks and then deprived of N (IRRI nutrient solution without NH4NO3) for 3 d. All the plants were grown in a growth room with a 16-h-light (30 °C)/8-h-dark (22 °C) photoperiod, and the relative humidity was controlled at approximately 70%.The roots of seedlings were equilibrated in measuring solution 1 (without NO3-) for 20 to 30 min before measuring at room temperature (24 °C–26 °C).The equilibrated seedlings were then transferred to the measuring chamber, and a small plastic dish (6 cm diameter) was filled with 10 ml of fresh measuring solution 2 containing 0.25 mM NO3-.Ion-selective Electrodes were made from 1.5 mm (external diameter) borosilicate blanks. The blanks were pulled to < 1 μm diameter tips using a vertical pipette puller and then silanized with tributylchlorosilane. The tips of electrode blanks were broken to a diameter of 2–3 μm, and then back-filled with appropriate solutions. The back-filling solutions for NO3- were 0.5 M KNO3 and 0.1 M KCl. The electrodes were calibrated with calibrate solution 1 (0.05 mM NO3-) and calibrate solution 2 (0.5 mM NO3-) prior to flux measurements.When the root became immobilized at the bottom of the dish, the microelectrode was vibrated in the measuring solution between two positions, 5 and 35 μm from the primary root surface, along an axis perpendicular to the root meristem zone.",
    "The background was recorded by vibrating the electrode in measuring solution not containing roots. The measuring lasted for 15 min.The data obtained were analyzed and converted into NO3- influx (negative) (pmol cm-2s-1) using the MageFlux program (http://www.xuyue.net/mageflux). The ion flux assay around each type of transformed cells was replicated independently five times."
