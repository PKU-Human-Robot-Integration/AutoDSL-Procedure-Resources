Rat aorta excision\n(A) The site for the initial incision (step 3) is highlighted by the blue arrow. The Y-shaped incision (step 4) is highlighted by the green arrows. Incisions under the thoracic cage (step 5) are highlighted by the yellow arrows. The ribs are pushed to the side to provide access to the heart and lungs (step 6), as highlighted by the red curves.\n(B) The heart and lungs are displaced (step 8) (yellow arrow) to provide access to the aorta (green arrows in the green region of interest).\n(C) Higher magnification of the region of interest.\n(D) The distal thoracic aorta is cut with fine scissors while being held with forceps and excised from the rat by progressive progression of the scissors alongside the vertebral column, as highlighted by the green arrow.\nThe ruler is graduated in centimeters.\nMake an incision on each side, just under the thoracic cage (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nPush the ribs to the side to have access to the intrathoracic organs (heart and lungs) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nCut the diaphragm, the vena cava, and the esophagus.\nDisplace the heart and lungs to clear the thoracic cavity (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).",
    "Displace the stomach, liver, and intestines to clear the abdominal cavity (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nAbsorb blood using an absorbent tissue.\nThe aorta is surrounded by fibroadipose tissue and appears as a whitish vessel along the vertebral column (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: Be careful not to mistake the aorta for the esophagus. The aorta is the vessel that is tightly bound to the vertebral column, whereas the esophagus is only maintained by smooth connective tissue.\nCut the distal end of the aorta using fine scissors.\nHold the distal end of the aorta using fine forceps and cut the subaortic tissue with scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C; Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]: Aorta excision, steps 13 and 14).\nCut the aorta at the proximal end (Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]: Aorta excision, steps 13 and 14).\nPlace the aorta in a Falcon tube containing EBM.\nNote: Steps 7–15 are also illustrated in Methods Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]: preparing aorta steps 7–15.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S1.

    "Note: Dissection is easier to practice in a moderately filled Petri dish to avoid floating movements of the aorta during dissection. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nUnder a stereo microscope, remove the fibroadipose tissue (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B; Methods Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]: fibroadipose tissue removal, step 17).\nNote: Due to the large size of the rat aorta, dissection is easier to practice at low (6–10×) magnification.\nRemove any intraluminal blood clots with forceps (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C; Methods Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]: intraluminal clot removal, step 18).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S3. Fibroadipose tissue removal, step 17\nHold the extremity of the aorta using forceps and insert a 2.5-mL syringe with a 23G needle containing EBM into the lumen.

    "Collagen polymerizes rapidly at 19°C–21°C. Prepare a small volume and use it immediately: mix 200 μL of the collagen stock solution with 200 μL DMEM, without glucose, in a hemolysis tube (the solution turns yellow [Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A; Methods Video S8[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc8]: Collagen solution preparation, step 22]) and equilibrate the pH with a few microliters of 5 N NaOH (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B; Methods Video S9[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc9]: pH equilibration, step 22). This working volume of 1 mg/mL collagen solution is sufficient for the embedding of six rings.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/422-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Preparation of working solution of collagen\n(A) After mixing 200 μL collagen stock solution with 200 μL “DMEM, no glucose” medium, the solution turns yellow.\n(B) After the addition of a sufficient volume of 5 N NaOH (typically 1–2 μL), the solution turns back to a persistent pink.\nNote: After the addition of collagen, the DMEM solution will turn yellow due to acidification. 5 N NaOH is used to equilibrate it to a pH of 7 to 7.4. The amount of NaOH to use is the minimal volume required that allows the red phenol of the DMEM to remain persistently pink. This volume should be empirically determined for each stock solution of collagen.\nCritical: Physiological pH is required to culture aortic tissue. If NaOH is gradually added (i.e., 0.5 μL by 0.5 μL), the color of the red phenol is a sufficient indicator for equilibrating the pH (the presence of sodium bicarbonate in the DMEM will help to maintain a physiological pH when incubated in a 5% CO2 incubator). We do not recommend using a pH meter or pH strips to avoid unnecessary time-consuming procedures during critical steps.\nCritical: Gently mix and homogenize the solution to avoid the formation of bubbles, which impairs proper sprouting. (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5])",
    "Critical: Always keep the collagen stock solution, “DMEM, no glucose” medium, and the prepared working solution of collagen on ice to prevent polymerization.

Collagen solution preparation, step 22\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S9. pH equilibration, step 22\nEmbedding of the aortic rings in the collagen matrix\nTiming: 45 min per aorta (plus 30 min of incubation).\nAortic rings are embedded using a 1 mg/mL working collagen solution.\nOff the ice, fill the wells of a 96-well culture plate with 60 μL of the working collagen solution.\nCritical: Off the ice, collagen will rapidly polymerize inside the well. We recommend filling only three wells at a time.\nCritical: The tube of the working solution should be kept on ice between each pipetting step. (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5])\nCritical: We do not recommend using the external wells of the plate because of excess evaporation from the peripheral wells.\nImmediately, gently pick up an aortic ring with the forceps and dry the ring and the tips of the forceps with an absorbent tissue to remove excess medium.\nCritical: Removal of all culture medium from the ring and the forceps is essential, as the addition of culture medium near the aortic ring significantly decreases the local collagen concentration and dramatically impairs vascular sprouting. (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5])\nEmbed the aortic ring into a collagen-filled well before it polymerizes. The ring should be placed in the center of the well and the walls of the aortic vessel should face the bottom (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/422-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Aortic rings embedded in a collagen matrix\n(A) Global view of a culture plate with 60 aortic rings embedded in a collagen matrix.",
    "(B) Higher magnification of two aortic rings embedded in a collagen matrix in the center of their wells.\nCritical: We recommend embedding the ring within 5 min following the addition of collagen to prevent polymerization. Do not attempt to keep the plate on ice during embedding to prevent matrix polymerization. At 4°C, the gel viscosity is reduced and rings do not stay still. (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7])\nCritical: Do not damage the collagen matrix by stirring with forceps. If the ring does not stay in the required position, hold it for 30 s with the forceps until the gel starts to polymerize. Then, gently remove the forceps from the gel while checking that the ring stays still. If the ring starts moving, hold it again for an additional 30 s.\nNote: The use of a stereo microscope may help in placing the ring in the center of the well.\nDiscard the hemolysis tube when it is emptied.\nCritical: Do not re-use tubes, as collagen may have polymerized inside the tube.\nOnce all the rings are embedded, add 200 μL PBS to all the empty surrounding wells to prevent evaporation in wells of interest.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C in 5% CO2 for 30 min to allow complete collagen polymerization.\nNote: If more than one culture plate is needed for the experiment, we recommend starting incubation of the first plate as soon as all the wells have been filled with aortic rings.\nAddition of culture medium\nTiming: 15 min per aorta (plus 4 days of incubation)\nPrepare EBM Medium by adding a 1:1,000 volume of Primocin.\nWarm the medium in a water bath at 37°C.\nAdd 150 μL warmed medium to each well.\nAllow vessel sprouting by incubating the plate for four days at 37°C and 5% CO2.",
    "Note: The EBM will provide all nutrients necessary for paracrine secretion of factors needed for aortic ring sprouting.\nCritical: The rings produce paracrine pro-angiogenic molecules that are necessary for the initiation of sprouting. Therefore, changing the medium before day 4 is not recommended.\nQuantification of sprouting and changing of the medium\nTiming: 30 min per aorta from day 4 to day 8 (20–30 rings)\nHere, we describe how to count sprouts and change the growth medium.\nStarting on day 4, sprouts are counted every day under a bright field or phase-contrast inverted microscope with a 40× or 100× magnification.\nSprouts grow from the cut sides of the ring.\nMicrovessels are composed of endothelial cells associated with pericytes. A small number of fibroblast and macrophages migrate into the gel around neovessels.\nCritical: Neovessels and fibroblasts can be hard to tell apart. Frequently readjusting the focus should help to definitively identify neovessels, which are thicker and longer than isolated macrophages and fibroblasts.\nNote: The serum-free culture condition strongly favors the sprouting of endothelial cells over the proliferation of fibroblasts.\nCounting is performed as follows (as previously described in Aplin et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/422-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Quantification of sprouts\n(A) Quantification of sprouts on day 4. A single sprout originating from the aortic ring (purple arrow in the left panel) has grown into 27 individual countable sprouts.\n(B) Evolution of sprouting of the same area from day 4 to day 6. Arrows highlight the growth and regression of three independent vessels.\nEvery branching generates two new vessels. Thus, each branch of a vessel is counted as a separate vessel.\nSprouts can merge and form loops. Therefore count each loop as two vessels.\nEach ring is counted daily until day 8 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).",
    "Note: To determine the sprouting growth rate, it is recommended that the same experimenter count the vessels every day at the same time of the day.\nNote: If you have more than one plate to count, take only one plate out at a time and leave the others in the incubator.\nThe medium has to be renewed at day 4 (and then every 2 days thereafter if necessary).\nPrepare EBM Medium with 1:1,000 Primocin and heat it in a water bath at 37°C.\nRemove 130 μL of the old medium and add 150 μL of the fresh medium into each well.\nNote: EBM Medium with 1:1,000 Primocin can also be prepared in a larger quantity on D0. However, the exact total volume of medium used for the entire experiment will not be known, as certain aortic rings will not be selected after D6 (see step 36).\nSelection of suitable aortic rings for testing compounds\nTiming: 1 h\nHere we describe how to select the rings that will be used to test compounds.\nAt day 6, select the sprouting rings that will be used for the rest of the experimentation. We advise selecting only rings that produce a minimum of 20 sprouts (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/422-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Selection of aortic rings for testing\nQuantification of sprouts per ring on day 6 for group constitution.\n(A) Violin plot representation of 181 rings (from 7 aorta) and stringent selection of 76 rings (42%) that will be used for the test.\n(B) Frequency log2 distribution of sprouts per ring for all rings (left panel) or selected rings (right panel).\n(C) An example of the distribution of aortic rings across homogeneous groups.\nIn (A) and (C), dots represent individual aortic rings and the dashed lines represent the median and quartiles.",
    "Note: Approximately 10% of rings fail to sprout. For the remaining rings, the number of sprouts typically follows a log-normal distribution (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B). The percentage of rings that grow and the number of sprouts per ring depends on the skill of the experimenter. Given the log-normal distribution, some rings sprout very heavily relative to the others, making it difficult to equally distribute them among the different groups. We recommend discarding them (in our example, we did not select rings with >95 sprouts on day 6; Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A). (Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9], 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11], and 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13])\nCreate groups in which the rings are assigned evenly according to their number of sprouts (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nNote: We recommend using a sufficient number of rings per group to allow proper parametric statistical analysis at the end of the experiment.\nAfter group assignment, change the medium and stimulate them with the compounds to be tested.\nFluorescence imaging (optional)\nTiming: 1 week\nAt day 8 after the last live-counting, aortic rings can be fixed for further fluorescence imaging.\nRemove the culture medium from all the wells.\nWash each culture well with 200 μL PBS three times (with 15-min intervals between each wash).\nFix the culture with 100 μL 4% formaldehyde for 30 min.\nCritical: Formaldehyde is toxic and must be used while wearing gloves under a fume hood.\nWash each culture well with 200 μL PBS three times (with 15-min intervals between each wash).\nNote: Formaldehyde waste must be collected for further specific elimination.\nDilute primary IBA1 antibody at 1:200 (2.5 μg/mL) and ISOLECTIN B4 (10 μg/mL) in PBS 0.1% Triton X-100 .\nIncubate for 3 to 7 days at 4°C.\nWash three times (15 min) with 200 μL PBS.\nAdd secondary antibody at 1:400 (5 μg/mL) and renew the ISOLECTIN B4 treatment (10 μg/mL).",
    "Note: Imaging through the gel is challenging and may result in a poor signal for macrophages (IBA1 positive cells), depending on the microscopy equipment. We do not recommend using lower concentrations of secondary antibodies without testing the signal using your set-up.\nIncubate for a minimum of 12 h at 4°C.\nAdd Hoechst 33342 at 1:1,000 and incubate for a further 30 min.\nCritical: Hoechst is a DNA intercalator and must be used while wearing gloves.\nWash three times (15 min) with 200 μL PBS.\nCritical: Hoechst waste must be collected for further specific elimination.\nVessels and macrophages can be observed directly in the well using an inverted fluorescence microscope.\nNote: Collagen gel does not generate as much fluorescent noise as a Matrigel-based matrix and high-quality pictures can be obtained with a confocal microscope. However, aortic rings are autofluorescent and images from an epifluorescent microscope are still very noisy.\nNote: If an inverted confocal microscope is not available, an upright confocal microscope can be used after removing the gel from the well. We recommend using needle to cautiously detach the gel from the well. Disruption of the gel may result in alteration of the vessel structure."
