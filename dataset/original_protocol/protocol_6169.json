    "In vitro acetylation analysis The acetylation status of TcrX protein (as a representative) is assessed by probing the protein using an anti-acetyl antibody by Western blot analysis, which is discussed in a stepwise manner in this protocol. Response regulator TcrX (6x his-tagged) and mutant TcrX (K231R) proteins are overexpressed and purified from E. coli BL21 Arctic ExpressTM and KATms (acetyltransferase/MSMEG_5458) from SP850cyc-strain, as previously reported in Singh et al. (2019). The purified proteins are quantitated through Bradford’s protein estimation assay (Stoscheck, 1990; He, 2011a) and the proteins are stored in storage buffer (-20 °C; see Recipes) until use. The protocol below describes the experimental procedure subsequent to protein purification. Setting up in vitro acetylation reaction followed by anti-acetyl Western blotting: Mix the following ingredients in the following amounts:TcrX or TcrX K231R proteins, 3 µg 10x acetylation buffer, 2 μl (see Recipes)cAMP, 0.4 μl (see Recipes for stock concentration)Acetyl CoA, 0.4 µl (see Recipes for stock concentration)KATms, 0.2 µgAdd autoclaved MQ water to 20 µl Incubate at 37 °C for 4 h (the incubation duration might vary between substrate proteins linked to extent of acetylation).Terminate reactions by diluting the reaction mixture with 5 µl of sample buffer (see Recipes). Heat the sample at 95 °C for 10 min.Resolve samples using 15% SDS-PAGE (He, 2011b) as per standard protocol at 100 V for 3-4 h.Transfer the protein to PVDF membrane by electroblotting using the Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot cell, as per the manufacturer’s protocol at 10 V for 1 h.Notes: Cut the PVDF membrane from the PVDF roll according to someone’s SDS-PAGE gel size and lanes loaded or use precut preassembled blotting membrane/filter paper sandwich from Bio-Rad.",
    "Transfer of proteins onto PVDF membrane takes 10 V for 1 h for this particular low molecular protein (~30 kDa) in a semidry transfer apparatus (Trans-Blot® SD cell) of Bio-Rad. It should be optimized according to someone’s protein of interest (high or low molecular weight) for voltage, current, timing and type of apparatus (Dry/Semi dry/Wet) to get an efficient transfer. Block the PVDF membrane with 5% BSA in 1x TBST (30 ml) for 90 min with gentle rocking at room temperature.Incubate with primary anti-acetyl lysine antibody diluted at 1:7,500 for overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. Wash the membrane 3 times with 1x TBST (50 ml) for 10 min each with rapid rocking.Incubate with 1:5,000 diluted secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature with gentle rocking.Wash the membrane again 3 times with 1x TBST (60-70 ml) for 10 min each with rapid rocking.Develop the blot using enhanced chemi-luminescence (ECL) as per the manufacturer’s protocol and image the blot in a Chemidoc gel documentation system (Figure 1).After developing of PVDF membrane wash the membrane with 1x TBST (50 ml) 3 times for 10 min each.Incubate the PVDF membrane at 55 °C with stripping buffer (30 ml; see Recipes) for 25-30 min (optimize accordingly).Pour off the stripping buffer and wash the PVDF membrane 6-7 times with 1x TBST (100 ml) with rapid rocking for 10 min each or β-mercaptoethanol is completely removed.Note: Do check for the typical smell of β-mercaptoethanol from PVDF membrane to ensure that it has been completely removed after washing with 1x TBST buffer. Repeat washing until it goes off completely. Block the PVDF membrane with 5% BSA in 1x TBST (30 ml) for 90 min at room temperature.",
    "Repeat the steps from Step A7 (use anti-his 6x his antibody at a dilution of 1:5,000) until Step A10 for developing the blot and acquire the image as specified in Step A11 (Figure 1). This step provides a reference image for the amount of protein loaded.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190701/20190701000654_7498.jpgFigure 1. In vitro acetylation assessment. RR proteins TcrX and TcrXK231R were incubated with KATms (acetyltransferase, MSMEG_5458enzyme from M. smegmatis) as per the protocol. Acetylation site defective TcrX protein was generated after site identification by mass spectrometry, as reported in Singh et al. (2019). Top, an image of blot probed with anti-acetyl lysine antibody and bottom, anti-His antibody.In vivo acetylation analysis of TcrX proteinIn vivo assessment of acetylation of a specific protein requires it to be overexpressed in Mycobacterial cells. Towards this, the typical approach involves cloning and expression of the ORF under a strong mycobacterial promoter like hsp60 or msp12 in a mycobacterial shuttle vector. Introduce the plasmid in Mycobacterial strains such as M. smegmatis and then analyze the expression or modification status of the overexpressed protein. The following steps describe the entire workflow towards that.Preparation for electrocompetent Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 strain is made electrocompetent to introduce the recombinant pMV261 mycobacterial plasmids carrying a gene of interest. Prepare 1% primary culture by inoculating 50 µl of Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 stock in 5 ml of Middlebrook 7H9 media containing 0.2% glycerol, 0.05% Tween-80 and 10% ADC.Incubate the culture at 37 °C in the shaker at 180 rpm until OD600 ~2 is obtained (approximately 2 days) Inoculate 1 ml of the primary culture to 100 ml of 7H9 broth supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, 0.05% Tween-80 and 10% ADC and grow at 37 °C in the shaker at 180 rpm until the OD600 of 0.8-1.0 (~24-32 h).",
    "Pellet the cells at 4,500 x g, 4 °C for 15 min, followed by 3-4 washes in 20 ml of autoclaved MilliQ water.This is followed by 3 washes with 20 ml of sterile 10% glycerol. Pellet the cells and resuspend in 2 ml of sterile 10% glycerol.Prepare aliquots of 200 μl each for electroporation in the 1.5 ml centrifugation tubes.Spot freeze the remaining aliquots of electrocompetent cells in 1.5 ml centrifugation tubes using pre-chilled 100% ethanol and store them at -80 °C until further use.Note: Keep a container filled with 100% ethanol at -80 °C for 6-8 h prior to start the preparation of electrocompetent cells. When the electrocompetent cells aliquots are ready in microcentrifuge tubes then dip the tubes in the container containing the prechilled ethanol before storage at -80 °C. Electroporation of plasmid DNA in M. smegmatis mc2155To an aliquot of electrocompetent cells add 1 µg of the recombinant plasmids and incubate on ice for 2 min.Prechill 2 mm electroporation cuvette on ice, add electrocompetent cells and the plasmid mixture into the cuvette and incubate on ice for 10 min. Wipe the outer walls of the cuvette and pulse at 2,500 V using an electroporator and immediately keep on ice.Note: At the end of electroporation, ~4-5 millisecond time can be observed on display of electroporator which good indication of correct current flow between the two parallel electrodes and efficient electroporation. If arcing takes place, timing is in seconds on display and set voltage differs from applied voltage on the cells during the electroporation. This is possibly due to high ionic strength of buffer, high salt or insufficient washing of cells which ultimately results in ineffective or no electroporation.  Add 200 µl recovery media (see Recipes) to the cuvette and transfer cells to a 15 ml conical tube.",
    "Add more media to bring the volume to 3 ml and shake the tube for 4 h at 37 °C at 180 rpm in shaker incubator for recovery of cells.Note: Keep the recovery media (see Recipes) in excess (20 ml) ready before electroporation.  Harvest the cells at 4,500 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant and resuspend pellet in 100 µl of recovery media.Plate cells on 7H11 media (agar base) supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 80, 10% ADC containing appropriate antibiotics (here 25 µg/ml kanamycin).Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 2 days to obtain transformants.Lysate preparation and in-vivo expression and acetylation status analysis For starter culture, inoculate single colony each of the recombinant strains in 5 ml of 7H9 media containing 0.2% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 80 and 10% ADC along with 25 µg/ml kanamycin and incubate it at 37 °C at 180 rpm in a shaker for 2 days. Subculture 0.5-1 ml of the primary culture in 50 ml of 7H9 broth supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, 0.05% tyloxapol and 10% ADC along with 25 µg/ml kanamycin and grow at 37 °C in the shaker at 180 rpm.Note: When a large volume of secondary culture (e.g., 1/2 liter) is needed, primarily to get good amount of protein, primary culture should also be of a larger volume (10-50 ml).  Once OD600 reaches ~2-3 (approximately 2-3 days), pellet the cells at 4 °C at 4,500 x g, wash 3 times each with 10 ml of sterile PBS and resuspend pellet in 500 µl of Tris lysis buffer (pH ~7.5).Transfer the suspension in 2 ml bead beating vial containing 0.",
    "1 mm diameter zirconia/silica beads (~250 µl volume of buffer) and bead beat for 30 s, 8-10 times with intermittent incubation on ice (optimize according to the instructions from the bead homogenizer manufacturer).Centrifuge the lysate for 10 min at 4 °C at 10,000 x g and collect ~400 µl of supernatant. Care should be taken to avoid collecting the unlysed cells and debris.Quantify the lysate by Bradford’s protein estimation assay.Resolve 100 µg of protein lysate by 15% SDS-PAGE as per standard protocol.Transfer the resolved protein to PVDF membrane by electroblotting as per the manufacturer’s protocol and proceed for Western blotting with anti-acetyl lysine antibody as described in the section above, followed by stripping and probing with protein-specific antibody (here anti-TcrX).Figure 2 depicts a representative developed blot reporting the overexpression of candidate response regulator protein TcrX and its acetylation status through specific antibodies. The blot also shows an absence of acetylation when a lysine mutant protein is used, confirming the site which undergoes acetylation in vivo.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190701/20190701000741_7032.jpgFigure 2. In vivo acetylation analysis. M. smegmatis mc2155 strains carrying either vector pMV261 alone or expressing wild type TcrX or its mutant protein were cultured in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (7H9). A total of 100 µg of total protein was analyzed by Western blotting using anti-acetyl lysine (top) and anti-TcrX (bottom) antibodies. Arrow represents the TcrX protein."
