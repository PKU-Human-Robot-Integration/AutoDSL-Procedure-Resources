    "This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. All animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Yueyang Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (IACUC number: YYLAC-2019-1). Male Wistar rats (200-240 g, 8 weeks old) were purchased from Shanghai SLAC Laboratory Animal Center.\n1. Rat model of T2DM\nMaintain male Wistar rats (200-240 g, 8 weeks old) in a climate-controlled environment with a 12 h light/dark cycle (20 ± 2 °C and 50%-60% relative humidity). Provide food and water ad libitum during the experimental period.\nMake efforts to minimize animal suffering, including gentle handling, daily cage cleaning, and monitoring.\nRandomly assign the rats to 3 groups: the control group (n = 5), DM model group (n = 5), and diabetic model treated with BBR group (n = 5).\nEstablish the rat DM model according to a previous description23.\n\t\nAdminister the rats with a single intravenous injection of streptozotocin (STZ) dissolved in freshly prepared sodium citrate buffer (w/v: 2%) at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Inject the control group intraperitoneally with an equal volume of citrate sodium citrate buffer without STZ.\nAssess the blood glucose using a blood gas analyzer. Use the rats with the indicated blood glucose level (≥16.7 mmol/L, continuously for 10 days) for the T2DM model.\nAfter 1 week, randomly divide the T2DM rats into two groups (n = 5 of each group): untreated rats or rats administered 200 mg/kg/day of BBR by gavage for 4 weeks.\n2. Primary tendon fibroblasts\nSacrifice the rats under anesthesia through intraperitoneal injection of barbiturate (40 mg/kg) and obtain the Achilles tendon as previously reported24.\nIsolate tendon fibroblasts from tendon tissues25.",
    "Shredthe tendon tissues manually and place them in DMEM containing 0.2% type II collagenase. Agitate vigorously for 3 h at 37 °C.\nRemove the medium by centrifugation and add DMEM containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin to the digested tissue.\nFilter the tendon tissues by a 100 µm strainer, pour the filtered solution into 6-well plates, and maintain the tendon fibroblasts in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\n3. Cell viability assay\nNOTE: Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to measure cell viability according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nAfter trypsinization, plate the tendon fibroblasts in 96-well plates (4 x 103 cells/well) and then treat them with different doses of glucose (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 mM) in the presence or absence of BBR (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 µM) for 48 h.\n\tNOTE: Glucose and BBR were dissolved in DMEM.\nAdd CCK-8 solution (10 µL) to each well, and incubate the cells for another 2 h at 37°C.\nSubsequently, measure the absorbance of each well with a microplate reader at a wavelength of 450 nm.\n4. Cell apoptosis analysis\nNOTE: A propidium iodide (PI) and annexin V-FITC flow cytometry assay was used to analyze the apoptosis rate of tendon fibroblasts.\nSeed the tendon fibroblasts (5 x 105 cells) in 6-well plates in DMEM for 24 h.\nAspirate and discard DMEM from each well. Treat the cells with fresh DMEM containing HG (30 mM) in the presence or absence of BBR (20 µM) for 24 h.\nDetach the cells with 0.25% trypsin in 1x PBS, harvest the cells with PBS, and centrifuge at 2000 x g for 5 min.",
    "Resuspend the cells in binding buffer (Table of Materials) and stain with 10 µL of FITC-conjugated annexin V and 5 µL of PI in the dark for 15 min at room temperature (RT).\nThen, analyze the cells by a flow cytometer.\n5. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)\nHarvest the tendon fibroblasts and homogenize using an RNA extraction kit (Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.\nPerform reverse transcriptional PCR with Moloney's murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and Oligo (dT) primers (Table of Materials).\nCarry out qRT-PCR using SYBR green qPCR Mix on real-time PCR System. The cycle conditions are denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min and 45 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 30 s.\n\tNOTE: For details of the primers for IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-10 refer to the Table of Materials. β-actin was used as the reference gene.\nCalculate the relative expression level using the 2-ΔΔCT formula, as previously described26 .\n6. Western blot analysis\nAfter treatment with HG (30 mM) in the presence or absence of BBR (20 µM) for 24 h, lyse the tendon fibroblasts with RIPA buffer (Table of Materials), and quantify the total protein concentration using the bicinchoninic acid assay.\nSeparate equivalent amounts of proteins (50 µg) from each sample by 10% SDS-PAGE at RT and then transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes at 4 °C for 2 h.\nBlock the membranes in 5% non-fat dried milk in TBST and then incubate overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: anti-LC3B (1:1500), anti-p62 (1:2000), and anti-β-actin (1:3500) antibody.\nAfter being washed with TBST, incubate the membranes with goat anti-rabbit H&L HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000) at RT for 1 h.",
    "Use an ECL chemiluminescence kit to visualize the specific blots and quantify the autoradiograms by densitometry.\n7. Immunohistochemical analysis (IHC)\nCut the paraffin-embedded foot tendon tissues into 6 µm-thick sections.\nAfter fixing the sections in 4% formalin, incubate the sections with anti-LC3 antibody (1:200) overnight at 4 °C.\nAfter washing three times using 10 mM PBS (pH7.4 with Tween 20), incubate all sections with goat anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000) for 1 h at 37 °C and stain with DAB and hematoxylin for 60 min at RT.\nImage the stained slides at 20x magnification using an inverted microscope.\n8. TUNEL assay\nNOTE: Cell apoptosis in tendon tissue was analyzed using a TUNEL assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nCut the paraffin-embedded foot tendon tissues into 6 µm-thick sections.\nDe-paraffinize the sections in xylene and rehydrate them in a graded series of ethanol.\nAfter immersing with 3% hydrogen peroxide at RT, incubate the sections with TUNEL reaction mixture for 1 h at 37 °C.\nCounterstain the nuclei using DAPI. Observe the stained cells under a fluorescence microscope (20x) and determine the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells.\n9. Statistical analysis\nUse appropriate software applications to perform statistical analysis\n\tNOTE: Here, the data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) of three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 23.0. Student's t-test was performed to compare differences between groups, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for multiple group analyses. The difference was statistically significant when p < 0.05.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
