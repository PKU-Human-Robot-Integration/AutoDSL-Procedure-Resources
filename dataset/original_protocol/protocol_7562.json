    "Sample collection (see General note 1) and preparation If swab/tissue collector item is not sterile, rub it with 70% alcohol on a piece of cotton or paper tissue/napkin and light it with the lighter.Allow the flame to die out and let it cool down in the air.Sample gathering; either:Collect a swab from the upper surface of the tongue or the inner surface of the cheek by mildly scrapping with any of the proposed or other similar objects (see General note 2);Cut off a piece (3–5 mm in diameter) of the mycelium grown on the plant tissue. Alternatively, scrap it from animal tissue or scrap bacterial or yeast growth from any such surface by using disposable sterile scalpel bladed or flame-sterilized scalpel, razor, or box cutter (see General note 3).Store sample in a 1.5 mL microtube (see Troubleshooting 1) until step B1. If needed, use some guidance/assistance to put it in (see General note 4).Fill a beaker to half capacity with tap water; this will serve as a water bath.Fill a 50 mL Falcon tube to half capacity with commercially available distilled water and place it into the beaker.Heat the beaker on the stove (camping gas or electrical) at full intensity until the water bath starts boiling; then, reduce to half intensity to keep the water boiling during the entire procedure.Cell lysis Add boiling hot water to the extraction tubeIf mechanical assistance in lysis is required (due to the nature, quantity, or physical qualities of the sample), add 250 μL of boiling-hot distilled water or half the volume you intend to use (precision is of no particular importance) to the extraction microtube containing the sample from step A4 (see General note 5).",
    "If no mechanical assistance is required, add the sum of the extraction volume of boiling water and go straight to step B4. Caution: Steam may come out of the Falcon tube upon unscrewing and the tube may be hot. Take precautions during touching and handling and keep it safely placed on the respective rack or any similar support (e.g., a small beaker or glass).Crush with a spiral motion of the pestle or other similar instrument for 2–3 min.Use an equal volume of boiling-hot distilled water (e.g., 250 μL, as suggested in step B1a) to wash cellular debris of the pestle within the microtube.Close the lid of the microtube and vortex or shake vigorously by hand for 1 min (see General note 6)Incubation Place the microtubes in the boiling water bath for 20–30 min or more, according to the extraction volume and rigor of extraction (see General note 7; see Troubleshooting 2). Use the incubation time to prepare the molecular testing reactions, if applicable (step E1).Upon completion, carefully open microtubes and pipette 10 μL from the center of the extraction volume to a PCR microtube.Caution:  Steam pressure will have built up in the microtube; thus, handle with care and away from the face. Preferably, place in a rack, either custom made or improvised, before opening and further handling.Dilutions Transfer 5 μL of the 10 μL to the first dilution tube and mix with 45 μL of distilled water by softly pipetting in and out 5–10 times, so as to have a 1/10 dilution. Use a 20 μL pipette for the whole procedure.Remove 5 μL of the 1/10 dilution to a second PCR tube (of 200 μL volume or as used per standard practice).",
    "Remove another 5 μL of the 1/10 dilution to the second dilution tube and mix with 45 μL of distilled water by softly pipetting in and out 5–10 times, so as to have a 1/100 dilution.Remove 5 μL of the 1/100 dilution to a third PCR tube (see General note 8).PCR amplification Prepare the mastermix, according to the desired protocol, while incubating the extract in the water bath and keep on ice until use (see General note 8). This step should be implemented during step C1. Dispense the required volumes of mastermix to the three PCR tubes with the serial dilutions for each sample and proceed to amplification in thermocycler as per standard procedure/protocol. This step should be implemented after step D4."
