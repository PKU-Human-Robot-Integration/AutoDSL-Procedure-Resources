    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDissection and slice preparation\nTiming: 20–30 min\nAfter the dissection area has been prepared and solutions oxygenated and chilled, anesthetize the mouse with 5% isoflurane until the pedal reflex is absent. Decapitate the mouse rostral to the cervicothoracic junction.\nExtraction and sectioning: After decapitation, extract the brain from the skull using dissecting scissors, a rongeur, forceps and microspatula and quickly submerge the brain in the 50 mL beaker containing oxygenated 0°C NMDG-based recovery solution.\nRemove the brain slicer matrix from the ice and transfer a small volume (1–2 mL) of recovery solution into the matrix. Using the plastic spoon, remove the brain from the 50 mL beaker and place it in the appropriate anatomical position on the matrix.\nWick away residual solution from the matrix using a Kimwipe or filter paper and insert razor blades along the desired slice intervals. After obtaining the desired anatomical brain sections, apply a uniform layer of glue to the specimen disk and carefully mount each section.\nSlicing: Promptly transfer the specimen disk to the vibratome buffer tray containing oxygenated ∼0°C NMDG-based recovery solution and allow the brain sections to equilibrate for 1–2-min prior to slicing.\nOnce the specimen disk is securely positioned, adjust the vibratome settings to the desired slicing speed (0.28–0.3 mm/s), vibrational amplitude (0.8–1.00 mm), and slice thickness (200-–400 μm depending on region of interest and anatomical orientation).\nElevate the vibratome stage towards the superficial plane of the mounted brain sections and assign the appropriate start-end positions.\nAs the vibratome begins to release slices of tissue containing the region of interest, use the open-ended transfer pipette to move slices to the submerged holding chamber containing oxygenated ∼32°C NMDG-based recovery solution.",
    "Pause Point: Recovery: Allow the slices to recover for 10-min in the submerged holding chamber before transferring slices to the ACSF-containing holding chamber. To improve slice health and longevity throughout recording sessions, arrange each slice on the holding chamber floor in the orientation used for experimentation. Any pharmacological manipulation requiring pre-incubation can be incorporated into the ACSF holding chamber at this point.\nPause Point: Slices should rest for ≥ 60-min in oxygenated ACSF prior to being used.\nNote: The timing, dissection, and slice preparation methods are very similar for multi-electrode array recordings, however the solutions for dissecting and recording differ (see tables \"Recording solution for multi-electrode array recordings\" and \"Dissecting solution for multi-electrode array recordings\").\nMulti-electrode array dissection\nTiming: 20–30 min\nBriefly, the brain should be removed within 30 s and 1 min, and submerged in cold dissecting solution. To specifically target the ventromedial portion of the dorsal raphe nucleus, which will be used as an example throughout this protocol based on its high proportion of serotonin cells, the experimenter will obtain 300-micron thick sections targeting −5.5 and −5.75 mm from Bregma.\nTo obtain these slices, after at least 1 min of the brain being submerged in cold dissecting solution, place it on a cold piece of filter paper on an inverted Petri dish that is placed in ice. Bisect the brain in the coronal plane, halfway between the olfactory bulbs and cerebellum.",
    "As described above, apply a uniform layer of glue on the specimen disk and place the tissue on the disk mounting the brain such that the rostral portion is facing down on the disk and the cerebellum is facing up. Place the brain and specimen disk into the vibratome buffer tray containing oxygenated 0°C dissecting solution. Allow the tissue to rest for at least 1 min before beginning to slice the most ventral portion of the cerebellum and then removing the cerebellum.\n300-micron slices are taken until ventromedial portions of the dorsal raphe are identified by the presence of the cerebral aqueduct. These slices are then collected and placed in a Petri dish containing room temperature (20°C–23.5°C) oxygenated recording solution (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A and 7B).\nThe cerebral aqueduct is cut through the middle resulting in a U, and the lateral portions are removed with a scalpel. The ventromedial portion of the DRN is directly below the cerebral aqueduct (“U”) (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A and 7B). Slices are then placed in room temperature (20°C–23.5°C) oxygenated recording solution in a plastic slice tray.\nPause Point: Slices are allowed to rest for approximately 30–45 min before multi-electrode array recordings begin.\nWhile the slice is recovering, add 40 μM of tryptophan and 3 μM of phenylephrine to the glass media bottle containing the remaining recording solution to be used for multi-electrode array recordings. Specifically when recording from 5-HT neurons, tryptophan is provided as a substrate for 5-HT synthesis in the slice to allow for intrinsic 5-HT1A auto-inhibition, and phenylephrine is provided to stimulate noradrenergic 1b receptors and sustain spontaneous spiking of 5-HT neurons.",
    "Lastly, add 50 mL of the recording solution containing tryptophan and phenylephrine to a 50 mL Falcon tube, and add 1 μM of 8-OH-DPAT and label the tube. This will be used for 5-HT1A inhibition of serotonin neurons during the recording session.\nNote: Multi-electrode array contacts should be cleaned with Q-tip and ethanol solution, and allowed to dry approximately 45 min before recordings begin.\nPatch-clamp electrophysiology: Pre-recording preparation\nTiming: 10–15 min\nPipettes: Prior to the recording session, pull 3–6 MΩ patch pipettes from borosilicate glass capillary tubes using a micropipette puller system. While the optimal patch pipette resistance for whole-cell recordings depends on neuronal morphology and the type of experiment being performed, pipettes with a resistance between 3–6 MΩ should be suitable for most patch-clamp experiments.\nAfter pulling pipette tips, house them carefully in a closed, airtight container to prevent air particulate from entering the distal end of the pipette tip.\nTo fill a pipette tip with internal solution, first aspirate a chilled aliquot of internal solution into a small syringe (0.5–1 mL) and place a non-sterile syringe filter (Nalgene, 4 mm diametric membrane) on the tip of the syringe.\nPlace a flexible, plastic MicroFil or microloader on the syringe filter tip, fill the patch pipette to 60%–75% of capacity, and rest the syringe-MicroFil assembly on ice for future use.\nPerfusion and slice positioning: Turn on the rig, configure the acquisition software, and perfuse warmed ACSF (30±2°C) into the recording chamber at a rate of 2–3 mL/min using a gravity-driven or peristaltic pump system.\nNote: ACSF entering the recording chamber should exit through an outlet into a pre-bleached Erlenmeyer collection container (2 L) connected to a vacuum system.",
    "When the ACSF reaches steady-state perfusion, use an open-ended transfer pipette to transfer a brain slice into the recording chamber and place a nylon thread-containing stainless-steel harp on the slice. Make sure the distance between nylon threads on the harp provides sufficient room to maneuver the patch pipette in the slice without interference.\nOnce the slice is positioned correctly in the recording chamber, carefully lower the stimulating electrode (bipolar or monopolar) into the slice so that it makes direct contact with the tissue in the region of interest.\nPatch-clamp electrophysiology: Patching\nTiming: > 5 min\nFill a patch pipette 60%–75% with internal solution and insert the pipette in the recording electrode holder. Fasten the pipette tightly with the O-ring rubber gasket and plastic washer.\nTo reduce the probability of cellular debris occluding the pipette tip, deliver continuous positive pressure through the pipette using a large/medium-bore syringe connected to the recording electrode holder via plastic tubing (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/566-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic depicting the steps to entering whole-cell configuration\n(A) Schematic depicting whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology alongside a 40× DIC image including a “healthy” and an “unhealthy” MSNs in the NAc. Scale bar: 80 μm.\n(B) Steps to entering whole-cell configuration with the associated current response to a voltage step elicited via the membrane test. (1) Using positive pressure to remove cellular debris from occluding the patch pipette, approach a healthy cell exhibiting features described in the text. (2) As the patch pipette produces a modest invagination of the membrane, remove positive pressure and apply gentle buccal suction to achieve a ~1GΩ seal (reflected by the membrane test). (3) After cell-attached configuration, apply brief pulses of negative pressure to enter whole-cell until a precipitous reduction in membrane resistance and sharp capacitive transients are observed.",
    "(C) A 40× DIC image of a cell in the NAc patched in whole-cell configuration. Scale bar: 50 μm.\nNote: Positive pressure will assist in identifying competent cells by moving aside neuropil and cellular processes obscuring neuronal borders.\nUsing the micromanipulator in low-power magnification, maneuver the patch pipette near the stimulating electrode in the region of interest and align the microscope vertically with the patch pipette.\nInitiate the membrane test on the recording software to generate a 50 ms, 10 mV voltage step looped at 20 Hz to continuously monitor pipette resistant and adjust pipette offset.\nEnsure that air bubbles and particulate are completely evacuated from the pipette tip using a brief pulse of positive pressure.\nSwitch to the high-power objective and use the fine-motion micromanipulator to lower the objective slowly into the recording chamber until a column of ACSF bathing solution immerses the lens. Adjust the depth (y-axis) of the high-power objective until the patch pipette can be visualized.\nCritical: Prior to proceeding, make sure that the tip of the patch pipette is patent by examining the clarity of the tip and visualizing tissue movement in response to positive pressure. An obscured pipette tip will reduce the likelihood of obtaining a successful patch.\nPrior to maneuvering the patch pipette through the neuropil, survey the area with the high-power objective for competent cells that (a) contain a thin, smooth cell membrane, (b) lack pyknotic or karyolitic nuclei, (c) appear turgid but easily deformable, and (d) are oriented with a membrane surface accessible to the patch pipette.",
    "Note: To maximize the likelihood of patching a healthy cell with reliable membrane parameters, avoid cells close to the surface of the slice. While cells embedded more deeply in the slice are more challenging to visualize, these cells are less likely to exhibit gross morphological disturbances from the slicing and handling process and will survive longer recording intervals.\nOnce a healthy cell is selected, move the patch pipette in close apposition to the cell membrane until a small invagination of the cell membrane is visualized as a “dimple” (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B-1).\nRelease positive pressure by removing the syringe and apply slow, continuous negative pressure using buccal (mouth) suction (Hamill et al., 1981[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nAlternatives: Buccal suction provides greater manual dexterity of the extent and duration of negative pressure applied to the cell. An alternative approach is to use a smaller-bore (5–10 mL) syringe that is retracted to create negative pressure.\nCritical: As negative pressure brings the outer leaflet of the cell membrane to the surface of the pipette tip, the current response and accompanying pipette resistance from the membrane test will approach 0 pA and ∼1 GΩ, respectively, indicating that cell-attached configuration has been achieved. Prior to entering whole-cell configuration, set the command voltage to −70 mV to approximate the resting membrane potential and minimize electrochemical disturbances to the cell when breaking-in.\nNote: Regardless of whether experiments will be performed in voltage- or current-clamp configuration, cells can be voltage-clamped near the resting membrane potential during initial break-in to reduce sudden electrochemical disturbances to the cell.\nApply brief pulses of negative pressure to rupture the patch of membrane beneath the patch pipette. A successful break-in is signaled by a precipitous reduction in membrane resistance and sharp capacitive transients time-locked with the membrane test (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B-2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).",
    "If the patch of membrane was incompletely rendered during the initial break-in, apply additional pulses of negative pressure while monitoring the membrane resistance.\nNote: If patching fails to convert to whole-cell configuration, avoid reusing the same patch pipette for subsequent attempts. The used pipette tip will contain membranous material from the unsuccessful patch that will preclude a GΩ seal from forming on subsequent cells.\nAfter entering whole-cell configuration, allow 3–5-min for the intracellular environment to equilibrate to the internal solution as it dialyzes the cell. This is particularly important for cells with highly arborized dendritic and axonal processes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B-3).\nNote: Important additional electrochemical parameters emerge when entering whole-cell configuration, including holding current (Iholding), membrane resistance (Rm), membrane capacitance (Cm), and access resistance (Ra). These parameters enable the experimenter to assess the patency of the patch pipette tip and stability of the seal during the recording period.\nNote: Absolute values of Ih, Cm, and Rm are determined by the type of cell being studied, experimental condition, which internal solution is being used, and ultimately experimenter technique. In general, cells being examined in whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration will display a higher Rm with Cs+-based internal solutions containing Na+ and K+ ion channel blockers. In contrast, cells examined using a K+-based internal solution will display a lower, more physiological Rm that requires a greater Ih, particularly when pronounced leak conductances are present.\nPatch-clamp electrophysiology: Recording in voltage-clamp configuration\nTiming: > 50 min",
    "For simplicity and broad applicability, we describe here an example of steps taken to examine the effects of receptor-specific pharmacology on glutamatergic transmission. Using the nucleus accumbens (NAc) as our model system, we will demonstrate how the metabotropic GABAB receptor (GABABR), a Gi/o-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), alters electrically-evoked glutamatergic transmission onto medium spiny projection neurons (MSNs) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) (Manz et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/566-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Example experiment performed in voltage-clamp configuration\n(A) Schematic depicting the parasagittal plane through which NAc-containing ex vivo brain slices are prepared.\n(B) Schematic of the whole-cell electrophysiological recording strategy in the NAc. Electrically-evoked EPSCs are recorded in MSNs patched in whole-cell voltage-clamp configuration with a Cs+-based internal solution.\n(C) A representative experiment showing how GABABR agonist, (RS)-baclofen (BAC, 1 μM), reduces glutamatergic synaptic strength onto MSNs in the NAc. Each point reflects the amplitude of an EPSC elicited via electrical stimulation at 0.1 Hz. To eliminate GABAAR-mediated synaptic currents, GABAAR antagonist, picrotoxin (50 μM), is included in the ACSF bath throughout the recording session. After obtaining a stable 10-min EPSC baseline, BAC is superfused for 10-min, after which the line is switched to the original ACSF.\n(D) Representative traces of EPSCs a\\t baseline (black) and in the presence of BAC (blue).\n(E) Summary graph depicting average EPSC amplitude at baseline and in the presence of BAC. Note: To compare outcomes across experiments, summary graphs of multiple experimental replicates should be depicted and analyzed following normalization.\nTo record electrically-evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) from MSNs in the NAc, begin by voltage-clamping the patched MSN at −70 mV using a Cs+-based internal solution according to methods outlined above (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nTurn on the electrical supply to the stimulating electrode and switch the discharge mode to current (I).",
    "Critical: Make sure to monitor key cellular and technical parameters (Ih, Cm, Ra, and Rm) throughout the recording period.\nBecause electrical stimulation triggers neurotransmitter release from glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals, incorporate a GABAAR receptor antagonist (e.g., picrotoxin or bicuculline at 50 μM) into the ACSF perfusion medium to eliminate coincident GABAAR-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs).\nPause Point: Allow sufficient time for the antagonist to completely infiltrate the slice (10–15 min, depending on how long it takes for the perfusate to reach the recording chamber).\nTo ensure that electrically-evoked EPSCs are exclusively glutamatergic, superfuse a broad-spectrum antagonist of ionotropic glutamate receptors (kynurenic acid, KynA, 50 μM) at the end of the experiment. To assess the specific contribution of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) or NMDA receptors (NMDARs) to the electrically-evoked EPSC, superfuse instead a selective AMPAR (NBQX, 10 μM) or NMDAR antagonist (D-APV, 50 μM) and examine the corresponding change in EPSC amplitude. Each concentration represents the final concentration of the drug in the perfusing medium.\nUsing an “Episodic” protocol to discharge the stimulating electrode, stimulate with the lowest intensity and pulse duration required to evoke an EPSC in the recorded MSN. Define an interstimulus interval (ISI) of 10-s (0.1 Hz) to minimize any activity-related synaptic rundown during the recording period.",
    "Note: The EPSC baseline reflects synaptic responses from a heterogeneous population of glutamatergic inputs, each possessing distinct pre- and postsynaptic properties. Thus, it is essential that a stable EPSC baseline is obtained prior to proceeding with subsequent experimental manipulations. Although we routinely report 10-min EPSC baselines, more time may be needed (12–15 min) to ensure that responses have completely stabilized. A stabilized recording is defined here as consistent synaptic responses, holding current, and membrane resistance (<20% change). Cells requiring considerably longer than 15 min to stabilize should be discarded from analysis, as gross electrochemical or technical disturbances to the patched cell are likely contributing to wavering EPSC responses.\nOnce EPSCs have stabilized, superfuse selective GABABR agonist, (RS)-baclofen (BAC, 1 μM), into the ACSF bath for 10-mins (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C and 4D).\nNote: To simplify pharmacological preparations, we recommend creating stock solutions of drug at 1000× the concentration used in the ex vivo preparation. Thus, a 1 μM solution of BAC in ACSF is obtained by incorporating 30 μL of a 1 mM BAC stock solution to a conical tube containing 30 mL of ACSF.\nContinue to examine changes in EPSC amplitude as BAC-containing ACSF begins to enter the recording chamber (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C–4E).\nCritical: Given that compounds possess distinct solubility profiles, superfuse, or introduce into the ACSF perfusion medium, drugs for 10–15-min to provide an adequate window of time to capture effects on EPSC amplitude (Baldi et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). Make sure Ra is closely monitored during the drug exposure period. Shifts in Ra can lead to changes in EPSC amplitude that are independent of the experimental manipulation. Experiments should be rejected if ΔRa is > 15% from baseline conditions.",
    "To begin terminating exposure to BAC, switch the perfusion line back to ACSF used to obtain the EPSC baseline. BAC will gradually exit the recording chamber during washout, returning EPSC amplitude back to baseline. Depending on the scientific question, continue to record EPSCs for 10–30-min post-washout (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C–4E).\nAlternatives: As the effect of BAC on EPSC amplitude stabilizes, several important experimental trajectories can be taken. To determine whether BAC-induced GABABR activity triggers a long-term change in glutamatergic synaptic strength, a selective GABABR antagonist (SCH 50911, 5 μM) can be incorporated into the ACSF bath following BAC (Atwood et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). A persistent change in EPSC amplitude in the presence of SCH 50911 indicates a long-lasting, agonist-independent change in synaptic strength. Alternatively, EPSC amplitude can be continuously monitored as BAC completely exits the ACSF bath. We recommend both trajectories be taken in different experiments so that a complete pharmacological profile of BAC can be obtained at the synapse being studied (Manz et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21], 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]).\nNote: All pharmacological analyses should be performed with the appropriate control experiments. Although BAC is a well-characterized and prototypical GABABR ligand, it is essential that experiments are performed ensuring that synaptic effects elicited by BAC are mediated by GABABR. Thus, prior superfusion of SCH 50911 should completely abolish subsequent effects elicited by BAC. If SCH 50911 is used to reverse the effects of BAC, separate experiments must be conducted to determine if bath-application of SCH 50911 alone unmasks a change in EPSC amplitude.",
    "A change in EPSC amplitude in the antagonist alone may indicate the presence of tonic receptor activity at the synapse. In the case of GABABR, an antagonist-induced increase in EPSC amplitude would suggest that endogenously-released GABA tonically inhibits glutamate release onto MSNs via GABABRs. Additional pharmacological experiments will then be needed to assess whether GABA-independent constitutive receptor activity is mediating this effect (Manz et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]; Uchimura and North, 1991[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib33]).\nAfter the experiment is completed, flush the perfusion line and recording chamber with hot water to prevent drug contamination of subsequent experiments. If lipophilic compounds are used, flush the line with a 10% bleach solution prior to rinsing with hot water. Make sure the 10% bleach solution has completely exited the recording chamber prior to beginning future experiments.\nPatch-clamp electrophysiology: Recording in current-clamp configuration\nTiming: > 10–20 min\nWe describe here a step-by-step approach to assessing differences in intrinsic membrane parameters between neuronal subtypes in current-clamp configuration. Using the NAc as our model system, we examine action potential (AP) firing rates in MSNs and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons, which exhibit regular-spiking and fast-spiking AP profiles, respectively (Manz et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). Importantly, both neuronal subtypes in the NAc exhibit a hyperpolarized resting membrane potential [VRMP = −70−(−90) mV] and lack intrinsic peacemaking mechanism, making them ideal current-clamp comparators (Scudder et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]; Tepper et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/566-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Example experiment performed in current-clamp configuration\n(A) Schematic of the whole-cell electrophysiological recording strategy of MSNs and PV-expressing FSIs in the NAc. Note: this experiment was performed in a PV-specific transgenic reporter line to differentiate FSIs from MSNs. Using a K+-based internal solution, MSNs and FSIs are patched in whole-cell current-clamp configuration and stabilized at ~−70 mV.",
    "(B) Example traces of membranes responses in FSIs (black) and MSNs (blue) following hyperpolarizing (−150 pA) and depolarizing (100, 200, 350 pA) current injection (IINJ). As IINJ becomes increasingly positive, increased AP firing is observed in both cell types, with FSIs exhibiting significantly increased spike frequency relative to MSNs.\nTo begin measuring intrinsic membrane properties, patch an MSN in whole-cell configuration using a K+-based internal solution according to the protocol outlined above.\nAfter breaking-in, switch the recording mode to current-clamp and set the command current to 0 pA (IInjected, INJ = 0). This setting will result in no current being injected into the cell, resulting in a transmembrane potential equivalent to VRMP.\nPause Point: Allow VRMP to stabilize prior to obtaining the measurement (3–5-min).\nNote: As the intracellular solution dialyzes the cell, the membrane potential recorded at IINJ = 0 pA will gradually hyperpolarize beyond VRMP. To circumvent the contribution of this phenomenon and various junctional potentials to the recorded VRMP, compare values at defined time points after entering whole-cell configuration (Barry and Lynch, 1991[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nCritical: The accuracy of the measured VRMP is heavily dependent on the quality of the patch, as a low-resistance seal will generate a significant leak current. Eliminate cells from analysis that were not patched adequately and cleanly.\nAfter recording VRMP, set the command current such that the membrane potential stabilizes at a defined value (e.g., ∼−70 mV). This will standardize the starting point at which sequential current steps will be delivered to cells with a different starting VRMP.",
    "To begin to assess voltage responses to intracellular (somatic) current injection, evoke sequential 400–800-ms current steps beginning at −400 pA at 0.016 Hz (1 step/min). Beginning with hyperpolarizing current steps will assist in the identification of a hyperpolarization-activated “sag” current, passive membrane conductances, and the input resistance (∼Rm) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nNote: We recommend incremental current steps of 20–50 pA, with smaller increments allowing more precise measurements of rheobase, defined as the minimum current of infinite duration needed to elicit a single AP.\nAlternatives: Shortening the inter-step interval may be possible in cells that are less susceptible to depolarization block. In the NAc, high-fidelity AP firing can be obtained in MSNs with an inter-step interval as short as 5-sec. However, a 1-min interval is suitable for cells in most regions and should be applied with careful consideration of the cell’s established electrophysiological properties.\nNote: A voltage sag (Vsag) indicates the presence of an Ih current mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) cation channels (Oswald et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]). A prominent Vsag is often present in cells that express HCN channels and exhibit autonomous peacemaking activity (He et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). MSNs and FSIs do not exhibit Ih and lack pacemaker activity (Kawaguchi et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nAs positive current steps elicit depolarizing voltage responses, APs will begin to emerge with increasing frequency. AP frequency is defined as the number of spikes elicited during a given 400–800 pA current step. An increase in AP frequency will occur until suprathreshold current injection triggers depolarization block, a process by which excessive current injection fails to evoke APs despite a depolarizing membrane response (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B) (Dovzhenok and Kuznetsov, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nTo obtain the rheobase, record the current step at which the first AP was elicited.",
    "After obtaining these data for MSNs, the same approach can then be performed in FSIs to assess cell type-specific differences in intrinsic membrane properties.\nNote: Specific features of the AP waveform can be used to assess contributing factors to intrinsic excitability, such as AP threshold, amplitude, and phases of the afterhyperpolarization (AHP) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nTo rigorously quantify AP threshold, a phase plane analysis can be performed on a single spike by plotting the first derivate of the AP (dV/dt) against the membrane potential (Vm). AP threshold is 5% of the maximum of the second derivative of this relationship (d2V/dt2), aligning closely with the inflection point of the phase plot. AP amplitude can then be assessed by measuring the peak of the AP relative to threshold (Kress et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Sun et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]).\nTo assess medium and slow AHP (mAHP and sAHP), the amplitude of the AHP can be quantified at cell type-specific time points following AP. A more isolated assessment of post-spike AHPs can be performed in voltage-clamp using K+-based internal solution. Briefly, set the command voltage to −50−(−60 mV) and applying a 100–400-ms voltage step to 0 mV. An outward “tail current”, indicating the mixed component AHP, will follow in close succession to the end of the voltage step. The contribution of specific K+ channels to the AHP, such as small conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels, can be assessed using selective SK inhibitor, apamin (50 nM), and other K+ channel blockers, such as TEA, 4-aminopyridine, Ba2+, and dendrotoxin (Goldberg and Wilson, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Shan et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]).\nPatch-clamp electrophysiology: Recording in cell-attached and loose-patch configuration\nTiming: > 10–20 min",
    "While patch-clamp electrophysiology performed in whole-cell configuration confers direct electrical access to the cell, this process may disrupt intrinsic cellular processes requiring an intact intracellular compartment, such as autonomous AP firing (Fricker et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). To circumvent this issue, cells can be examined in cell-attached configuration by maintaining patched cells near the 1 GΩ seal without converting to whole-cell. This technique is particularly useful for long-term (> 10 min) analyses of neuronal spontaneous firing rate. Because the steps to entering cell-attached configuration are identical to those needed for whole-cell, we provide here conditions for optimizing cell-attached recordings (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/566-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Example recording performed in cell-attached configuration\n(A) Schematic of the cell-attached (or loose-patch) electrophysiological recording strategy of tonically-active cholinergic interneurons (CINs).\n(B) Example trace of spontaneous APs observed in CINs. Holding current (Iholding) is stabilized by voltage-clamping CINs at −70 mV (not required to observe AP firing in cell-attached).\nTo perform cell-attached recordings, backfill patch pipettes with ACSF instead of an internal solution to resemble the extracellular environment. This will establish the electrochemical driving force for spontaneous AP firing in the membrane patch beneath the pipette (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nCritical: The speed with which a GΩ seal is formed can influence the duration of cell-attached recordings. To minimize premature conversion to whole-cell configuration, we recommend positive pressure be removed and only moderate, if any, negative pressure applied to the cell. This will minimize sheer stress to the patch of membrane beneath the patch pipette. As experimental technique improves, removal of positive pressure will be sufficient to obtain the GΩ seal.",
    "Alternatives: Long-term recordings in cell-attached configuration can lead to the gradual degradation of the GΩ seal. If cell-attached configuration is used to assess spontaneous AP firing, a GΩ seal may not be necessary to observe high-fidelity AP firing. In this case, loose-patch recordings may be a useful alternative.\nTo perform loose-patch recordings, a similar experimental approach to cell-attached configuration is taken, except patch pipette resistance is intentionally maintained below 1GΩ (50–200 MΩ). This is accomplished easiest by reusing prior patch pipettes.\nWe provide an extended representative trace of spontaneous APs observed in tonically-active cholinergic interneurons (CINs), one of few neuronal subtypes in the NAc that exhibit intrinsic pacemaker activity (Cheng et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nNote: The representative trace depicted is from a CIN patched in cell-attached configuration with a patch pipette resistance of 4.2 MΩ backfilled with ACSF, resulting in a ∼1.4 GΩ seal that persisted for 32.5 min (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nDorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) serotonin (5-HT) neuron multielectrode array preparation\nTiming: > 10–15 min\nThis protocol is written for use with the multi-electrode array and recording system from Multi-Channel Systems (MCS), although there are several manufacturer systems for which the instructions would be similar. We describe multi-electrode array recordings in the DRN as neurons in this region autonomously fire action potentials in an ex vivo slice. For DRN recordings 6×10 (60 electrode) perforated arrays are used mounted in the MCS recording chamber on an inverted microscope to visualize the full array and recording chamber. The diameter of each electrode is 30 microns and the space between electrodes is 100 microns resulting in the electrodes covering a total space of 1200 × 680 microns (Green et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Siemann et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]).",
    "Room temperature (20°C–23.5°C) oxygenated (95%O2–5%CO2) extracellular recording solution for multi-electrode array recordings (in mM: 124 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 1.3 MgSO4, 2.5 CaCl2, 10 D (+) glucose, and 26 NaHCO3) containing 40 μM tryptophan and 3 μM phenylephrine is used for the recordings of DRN 5-HT neurons. Tryptophan is provided as a substrate for 5-HT synthesis in the slice to allow for intrinsic 5-HT1A auto-inhibition, and phenylephrine is provided to stimulate noradrenergic 1b receptors and sustain spontaneous spiking of 5-HT neurons.\n300-micron ventromedial DRN slices, sectioned between −5.5 and −5.75 mm from Bregma, are used for this preparation. The lateral portions are removed with a scalpel and slices rest in the recording solution in a plastic slice tray for approximately 30–45 min before recordings begin (Figures 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A and 7B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/566-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Setup of a multi-electrode array recording from a DRN slice\n(A) A representative DRN slice after dissection, circled in red.\n(B) A representative DRN slice used for recordings once the lateral tissue is removed and the cerebral aqueduct is cut resulting in a “U” shape. The ventromedial portion of the DRN, which is the area used for recordings, is located just below the cut aqueduct or “U” shape.\n(C) Demonstration of the components of a multi-electrode array including the contacts and recording chamber along with the location/placement of the DRN tissue and an electrophysiology harp to keep the tissue in place.\n(D) Demonstration of the baseplate of the recording stage and the O-ring, covered in vacuum grease, which is necessary to maintain a tight seal once the multi-electrode array and the components shown in (C) are firmly pushed down onto the O-ring.",
    "(E) Once the multi-electrode array, harp, and tissue are firmly placed on the O-ring, the pre-amplifier is attached along with the heated inflow and safety lines.\n(F) The overall setup for a multi-electrode array recording.\nNote: The ventromedial portion of the DRN contains approximately 70%–95% serotonin cells (Kirby et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]), which gives the experimenter confidence that DRN 5-HT neurons will likely be identified and recorded from, however the DRN contains a heterogenous population of neurons (glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic), which are more typically found in higher proportions in the lateral “wings” of the DRN (Kirby et al., 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nFill a pipette with recording solution and collect a ventromedial DRN slice from the slice tray. Carefully place the slice and recording solution onto the multielectrode array. Use Kimwipes to carefully remove excess recording solution to ensure the slice makes contact with the recording electrodes (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C).\nUnder visual control through the inverted microscope carefully use a fine-bristle paintbrush dipped in recording solution to gently move and orient the slice such that the cerebral aqueduct is in line with the long axis of the electrode array rectangle as this will cover the majority of the ventromedial portion of the DRN.\nWith ultra-fine forceps, under visual control, carefully place an electrophysiology harp (Multi-Channel Systems) over the slice to immobilize the slice on the electrode array.\nGently push the multielectrode array down to seat it on the recording chamber O-ring, which has been lubricated with vacuum grease to ensure a tight seal (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D).\nNote: Push gently down on the outside rim of the multielectrode array recording chamber. By pushing on the array, itself, this will result in the contacts being dirtied and could also damage or break the array.",
    "Place the pre-amplifier plate on top of the baseplate of the recording stage, which now contains the multielectrode array, and lock the amplifier in place, making contact with the electrode leads on along the edges of the array.\nAdd a few drops of oxygenated recording solution to the slice and recording chamber to maintain slice health and cell viability.\nPlace the heated (32°C) inflow and safety suction lines into the recording chamber and turn on the peristaltic pump, keeping it at a rate of 1.3 mL/min (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]E).\nNote: Steps 48–54 should take approximately 45 s or less to ensure cell and slice health. Adding too much recording solution to the recording chamber increases the likelihood that the electrophysiology harp and/or slice moves off of the electrodes and the desired location, however removing too much liquid will increase the likelihood of cell death and decrease slice viability.\nAs the outflow line is connected to the baseplate of the recording stage, use visual verification that both the inflow and outflow lines are distributing recording solution properly, and there are no air bubbles present in the lines at the beginning or throughout the recording.\nCritical: Make sure that the tip of the inflow and safety suction lines are touching the top inside portion of the multielectrode recording chamber. If these lines are not properly secured, they can generate electrical and mechanical noise. Importantly, make sure the safety suction tube is fastened properly, as this line is used to ensure no excess liquid spills over/out of the recording chamber and thus would damage the amplifier as a result. This problem can occur, for example, if there are issues with the outflow line and it slows relative to the inflow.",
    "Once it is established that the lines are working properly and oxygenated recording solution is constantly being perfused, allow the slice to settle onto the recording electrodes for approximately 45 min (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]F).\nMultielectrode array recording\nTiming: > 10–15 min\nAfter waiting approximately 45 min for the slice to settle, identify the channels that are exhibiting consistent neuronal firing, and obtain a baseline recording while oxygenated recording solution is being continuously applied at a rate of 1.3 mL/min for 4–5 min.\nAfter obtaining a sample stable baseline activity from recorded neurons, pharmacological agents can be applied to test for synaptic, or ionic mechanisms regulating 5-HT neuron activity. The larger sample sizes available with array recording can facilitate obtaining dose-response relationships (e.g., to ADRA1b agonist, or TREK-1 K+ channel antagonists (Giannoni-Guzmán et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34]; Green et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]), compared to single cell recording methods.\nCritical: To identify putative 5-HT neurons use the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT to evoke inhibition of the spontaneous spike rate. Have a separate line connected to the peristaltic pump and a Falcon tube of an oxygenated 1 μM 8-OH-DPAT solution. Allow sufficient time for the 8-OH-DPAT to fill its own line, (approximately 2 min) as the recording continues. Importantly, do not stop the peristaltic pump until the 8-OH-DPAT line has filled and 4–5 min of baseline recording have passed. Make sure the 8-OH-DPAT line is in a container (i.e., pipette tip box) to collect the solution as it drips if the line has filled before the 4–5 min of baseline recording have passed.",
    "To identify units that are putative 5-HT neurons, after experimental manipulations have been performed, briefly stop the peristaltic pump, remove the inflow line with recording solution and replace it with the 8-OH-DPAT line. Restart the pump, use a pipette to add a few drops of 8-OH-DPAT to the multielectrode array slice chamber, and continue to record for an additional 5–6 min. Place the recording solution line away from the recording area in a container (i.e., pipette tip box) to collect the solution as it drips during the recording as it is still connected to the pump.\nCritical: We have used a criterion of 50% spike rate suppression within 5–6 min of application of 1 μM 8-OH-DPAT, to identify putative 5-HT neurons (Green et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Siemann et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]). Make a note of when the 8-OH-DPAT was added to the recording chamber as this will be critical to calculate if 50% suppression of the neuronal spike rate was obtained during this period compared to the original recording period.\nAfter 5–6 min of recording under 8-OH-DPAT conditions at a rate of 1.3 mL/min have passed, stop the pump and switch the 8-OH-DPAT and recording solution lines again, now placing the recording solution line into the recording chamber, and allowing the 8-OH-DPAT line to drip in a container (i.e., pipette tip box) outside of the recording area.\nRestart the pump again and record for 4–5 min to ensure that the slice and 5-HT neurons can recover from 5-HT1A suppression via 8-OH-DPAT. This is important as it will help differentiate if the lack of neuronal firing observed was in fact due to 5-HT1A inhibition, and not due to potential cell death.\nNote: Again, make a note of when the recording solution was added to the recording chamber.",
    "Once 4–5 min have passed of the second application of recording solution, stop the peristaltic pump, stop the recording, remove the inflow and safety suction lines from the multielectrode recording chamber, remove the amplifier from the baseplate of the recording stage, and dispose of the excess recording and 8-OH-DPAT solutions.\nCritical: It is essential that throughout the experiment the recording is continuous and never stops even when the pump is paused briefly (5–10 s) to allow for the recording solution and 8-OH-DPAT lines to be switched as this will allow for proper analysis of the entire recording.\nAfter the experiment is completed, remove the multielectrode array from the baseplate, remove the electrophysiology harp, wipe off the excess vacuum grease on the bottom edges, and place it in a container on a rocker in a cold 5% Tergazyme solution. After the array has been in 5% Tergazyme for at least 2 h and no more than 24 h, remove the array from the solution and place it in a new container filled with water on a rocker and keep it in the water container until needed for future recordings (replace the water weekly). If recording from multiple slices per day, then ideally prepare to use new/clean multi-electrode arrays for each slice. If this is not possible, wait at least 2 h or longer and confirm that the previous slice tissue has been removed and cleaned with Turgazyme in the shaker. Finally, run water through the inflow and outflow lines to clean the lines and to prevent contamination for subsequent experiments, and turn off the peristaltic pump, the safety suction line, heater, and oxygen tank.",
    "Briefly, for the analysis of DRN 5-HT neurons using multi-electrode arrays, multiple different software programs can be used. We utilize Offline Sorter (Plexon Inc.) and apply a Bessel filter to the raw traces that were obtained and identified as potentially serotonergic cells from the different channels during the recording. Threshold levels are determined by manually selecting the least amount of unipolar noise. A K means scan method is then applied, which will cluster the spikes based on characteristics such as amplitude, spike duration, etc. We then manually identify and verify if cells demonstrate the characteristic waveforms observed for DRN 5-HT cells, such as broad spike waveform, regular and low frequency firing rate (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]B). Once a cell displays these characteristics, we then note if the cell had been responsive to 5HT1A inhibition. We calculate the firing rate during the application of recording solution and compare this to the firing rate when 8-OH-DPAT was applied to the slice. If the firing rate suppression is greater than 50% during 8-OH-DPAT application, we count the cell as serotonergic and include it in our analysis (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]C), however if 50% suppression is not achieved, then the cell is not included in our calculations. In addition to single units, multiple cells can be recorded from a single electrode. To separate and track the activity of multiple cells on an electrode we use the same methods applied above, including the K means scan method. Multiple cells will be typically separated based on differing spike waveform characteristics, and for 5-HT identification utilize the same 50% suppression criteria when 8-OH-DPAT is applied to the slice. As a result, anywhere between 50 to 150 cells can reliably be recorded from in 5–7 slices (Green et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Siemann et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]).",
