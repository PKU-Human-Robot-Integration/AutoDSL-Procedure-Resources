    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Westlake University.\n1. Implant assembling\nNOTE: Assembling of the imaging implant is technically simple and requires only commercially available items (Figure 1, see also Table of Materials). The head plates can be manufactured at the local machine shop using stainless-steel or titanium plates. We suggest preparing a stock of fully assembled implants before starting the surgeries. After in vivo experiments are done, the implants can be recovered and reused multiple times. In some cases, it may only require reattaching the infusion cannula by soldering or replacing the cover glass.\nPrepare all six key hardware components for assembling and installation imaging implants (Figure 1).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62266/62266fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Six key hardware components for assembling and installation of the imaging implant.

    "NOTE: For this preparation, we used a commercially available flux that is specified by the manufacturer to be for soldering stainless steel parts as imaging and infusion cannulas are made of stainless steel. In the case of other materials used to manufacture cannulas, end-user should select flux that can weld the selected material.\nMelt soldering tin and apply it to the connection spot treated with flux (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Avoid excess soldering tin, as it will require unnecessary larger craniotomy during the surgery.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62266/62266fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Schematic of assembling injection cannula, consisting of guide cannula with inserted dummy cannula, with the imaging cannula.

Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62266/62266fig02large.jpg]\nWait for the soldering tin to cool down. Usually, it takes several seconds.\nConfirm that the injection cannula is not blocked by inserting the dummy cannula from both directions.\nApply UV-curing optical adhesive on the bottom side of the imaging cannula using a toothpick or 26 G syringe needle.\nUse a fine tweezer to carefully place a cover glass of the corresponding size to the imaging cannula.\n\tNOTE: The positioning of the glass must be done precisely onto the imaging cannula without moving the glass too much once it has touched the optical adhesive. Otherwise, the glass gets dirty, thus reducing the quality of imaging.",
    "Cure the adhesive for a least an hour by 350-400 nm UV illumination from a standard handheld UV lamp.\n\tNOTE: The used adhesive must be optically transparent. Otherwise, it will decrease the quality of the imaging window.\n\tCAUTION: Avoid skin and eye exposure by wearing UV-protecting glasses, gloves, and a lab coat.\nWash the cannula in 70% ethanol, air dry, and store in a sterile container until surgery.\n\t​NOTE: It is very important to keep the cover glass as clean and intact as possible. The used optical adhesive is chemically stable in 70% ethanol.\n2. Window implantation\nPreparation steps before the surgery\n\t\nSterilize all the surgical instruments in an autoclave.\nPrepare 1x PBS and 70% ethanol in two separate Petri dishes.\nOptionally: Disinfect the surgery area using UV light for at least 20 minutes before starting the surgical procedure.\n\t\t​NOTE: Operating under the most sterile conditions possible will result in successful and long-lasting (as long as 6 months) glass-covered cranial windows. Contamination may result in reduced window transparency or severe inflammation in most cases.\nSurgical procedure\n\t\nSterilize the surgical area with 70% ethanol right before the surgery.\nWeigh the animal and administer a pre-surgical dose of analgesic subcutaneously according to the IACUC approved animal protocol.\nAnesthetize a mouse with isoflurane (4% for induction, 1.5-2% for maintaining, 0.3-0.5 L/min flow rate of air). Use a tail-pinch and toe-pinch technique to ensure the animal is fully sedated. Observe vital signs of the animal, such as respiration, SpO2, and heart rate for the duration of the procedure.\nUse a trimmer or depilatory cream to remove the fur from the back of the neck up to the eyes.",
    "Place mouse in a stereotaxic frame over a surgery heating pad (maintaining 37 °C). Secure the head with ear bars. Slightly push the head in all directions to make sure the head is secured firmly.\nApply eye ointment to prevent the animal's eyes from drying out during the surgery.\nSterilize the surgical site with betadine followed by 70% ethanol three times before making an incision.\nRemove the skin over the top of the skull, starting with a horizontal cut all along the base of the head, followed by two cuts in the rostral direction, almost reaching the eyelids, then two oblique cuts that converge at the midline.\nWith two sterile cotton swabs, retract the connecting tissue, as well as the musculature of the back of the neck, to the edges of the skull.\n\t\tNOTE: Try to avoid damaging blood vessels (especially ones hidden in the muscle) during manipulation.\nApply a drop of lidocaine solution (~0.1 mL) to the surface of the periosteum for 2 minutes to avoid excessive pain. Optionally to reduce the brain from swelling after removing the skull, 0.1 mL of 1% dexamethasone can be injected subcutaneously.\nGently scrape the entire exposed area of the skull with a scalpel to create a dry and rough surface that allows glue and the dental cement to adhere better and thus resulting in chronic implantation.\nPlace the tip of the needle mounted on the stereotaxic station onto the bregma, set all three coordinates (AP: Anterior-Posterior; ML: Medial-Lateral; DV: Dorsal-Ventral) as 0.",
    "Place tip of the needle onto the lambda and see if the AP coordinate is 0 to confirm that the head position is vertical, as well as if the ML coordinate is 0 to confirm the head is positioned horizontally. If not, adjust corresponding knobs on the stereotaxic station, until the AP and ML coordinates are both within 0.1 mm.\nMove the tip of the needle to find the corresponding points for craniotomy and mark their positions on the skull using a fine marker. In the case of implantation for hippocampus, there are 4 points with the following coordinates (AP: -0.68, ML: -2.0) (AP: -3.68, ML: -2.0) (AP: -2.18, ML: -0.5) and (AP: -2.18, ML: -3.5)11, as well as (AP: -4.0, ML: -2.0) for the most caudal point of the injection cannula.\n\t\t​NOTE: The marker used in this step must be sterilized using UV illumination for at least an hour before the surgery. The coordinates shown here are for 6-8-week old C57BL/6J mice. The coordinates may differ due to different ages or strains of mice.\nDraw a circle based on four marked points, as well as the outline of the injection cannula area on the caudal side of the circle (Figure 3).\nUse a pneumatic drill at the speed of 10,000 rpm to gently \"draw\" along the outline marked on the skull.\nDrill the skull until a very thin layer of bone is left, which usually starts to wiggle under gentle touch in the center.\nApply a drop of sterile 1x PBS to the center of the craniotomy, lift the bone flap from the skull with very thin tip forceps or two 26 G needles approaching from opposite sides.\n\tNOTE: The PBS will help remove the piece of skull and prevent possible bleeding of the dura12.",
    "Apply PBS, followed by gentle aspiration through a 26G blunt needle several times to clean the surface of the dura.\nGently remove the dura, either by aspiration or by ophthalmic scissors. Apply gentle suction (~-60kPa) to ablate the cortex, as well as the corpus callosum above the hippocampus.\n\tNOTE: The cortex is often more yellow than the corpus callosum, and the corpus callosum is usually whiter than the hippocampus. The corpus callosum is usually easy to distinguish by neuronal fibers going in the vertical and horizontal directions when observed from the top (Figure 3).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62266/62266fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Stereotaxic coordinates of hippocampus location and brain ablation process.

(C-E) Representative images acquired during the surgery (left) and their schematic diagram (right) indicating the different colors and directions of neural fibers of (A) Cortex (B) Corpus Callosum, and (C) Hippocampus visible during cortex ablation. Scale bar: 1 mm.

Apply 1x PBS, followed by gentle suction, while aspirating the cortex to get rid of the blood.\n\tNOTE: Continuous bleeding is inevitable during this step, and to some extent, continuous bleeding is a sign of normal blood pressure. Unlike cortex imaging window implantation, the presence of blood under the optical window is acceptable since it will be cleared several days after the surgery. Insertion of the imaging cannula to the created cavity as soon as possible after ablating the cortex is optimal.\nIf the craniotomy is larger by <0.5 mm than the imaging cannula, rescue the installation of the cannula to some extent by using extra Kwik Sil sealing before fixing the implant with SuperBond.",
    "If the craniotomy is smaller by <0.5 mm than imaging cannula, rescue the surgical procedure to some extent by trimming the edge of the craniotomy using a fine tweezer or a pair of ophthalmic scissors since the remaining bone at the edge of craniotomy is thinner than the skull itself as a result of drilling.\n\tNOTE: Craniotomies which are exceeding the ranges above 0.5 mm cannot be rescued. The corresponding actions in those cases should follow the termination procedure according to the animal protocol.\nGently insert the implant into the craniotomy.\nFirmly press on top of the implant with the L-shaped needle to position the optical window of the implant as close as possible to the exposed surface of the hippocampus. Repeatedly apply PBS on the skull around the implant followed by suction to remove blood as much as possible during implant insertion. Then apply a thin layer of Kwik Sil between the implant and skull to prevent dental cement from penetrating under the skull (Figure 4).\n\t\nEnsure the placement of the optical window of the implant is right against of hippocampus to avoid blood or other liquid accumulation underneath.\n\t\tNOTE: The critical point is to make sure that the cover glass of the imaging cannula is placed right against the hippocampus, which may require gentle pressure on top of the cannula during the installation and sealing process. Whether the upper side of the imaging cannula is parallel to the skull is not critical for the final optical access as long as the optical window is placed against the hippocampus.\nAccording to the average thickness of the cortex above the CA1 area, keep the upper surface of the imaging cannula above the skull surface by ~0.5 mm to facilitate attachment of the cannula to the skull (Figure 4).",
    "Once the Kwik Sil is cured, which usually takes no more than ~1 min, apply Super-Bond C&B evenly on the surface of the skull, the surface of Kwik-Sil, and the upper surface of the implant.\nOnce the Super-Bond C&B is cured, apply denture base resin above the Super-Bond C&B, as well as the skin around the incision made at the beginning of the surgery.\n\tNOTE: Alternative types of cement are available from multiple vendors. Follow the corresponding manufacturer's instructions.\nAfter the denture base resin is cured, place the head plate on the resin around the implant and make it concentric with the imaging cannula. Apply more denture base resin around and above the head plate to fix its position. Let it cure for several minutes.\n\t\nAvoid building up a thick layer of cement around the cannula to ensure better access to the imaging window with the objective lens (Figure 4).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62266/62266fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Schematic diagram of window implantation in (A) coronal and (B) sagittal view.

    "Check the health status of the mouse for 72 h post-surgery by observing general behavior. Anti-inflammatory drug and analgesic are injected subcutaneously for two-three days post-surgery every 24 hours to release pain and reduce the inflammatory response.\n\tNOTE: Alternative monitoring procedures, drugs, and dosages are possible for postoperative care, refer to the IUCAC approved animal protocol for the exact procedure.\nCheck the window 5-7 days post-surgery to observe vasculature under the window. In the case of a clear window, the animal is ready for virus injection.\n3. Virus Injection\nNOTE: Virus injection is usually done in 5-7 days after the surgery. Before virus injection, it has to be confirmed that the imaging window is clear, and it is possible to observe brain vasculature (Figure 5). In some cases, it may take up to 14-16 days to clear the window, which is also acceptable if no brain inflammation is detected.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62266/62266fig05.jpg\nFigure 5: Representative image of optical window (A) before and (B) after virus injection supplemented with FastGreen dye.

    "Anesthetize the animal with isoflurane (4% for induction, 1.5-2% for maintaining, 0.3-0.5 L/min flow rate of air), fix the head in a stereotaxic frame over a heating pad (maintaining 37 °C), apply eye ointment.\nWithdraw 600 nL of the virus solution, remove the dummy cannula and insert the internal cannula connected to the injection syringe into the guide cannula, infuse the virus at the speed of 50 nL/min for 10 minutes in total.\n\tNOTE: Check if the dye is visible through the window using a stereomicroscope to confirm successful virus injection (Figure 5).\nAfter injection, keep the internal cannula connected for 10 minutes to allow the virus to spread under the window.\nGently remove the internal cannula from the guide cannula and recap it with a dummy cannula.\nPlace the animal in a warm cage until it recovers from the anesthesia.\n\t​NOTE: Typically, mice are ready for imaging in 10-20 days after viral injection. Expression level and time depend on the virus serotype and promoter used to drive gene expression.\n4. Imaging of awake mice under wide-field microscope.\nNOTE: The prepared head plate provides extraordinary stability of imaging implant and thus allows for longitudinal imaging in awake and behaving mice with minimal motion artifacts.\nInduce the mouse with 4% isoflurane for a few minutes, fix its head plate to the head fork, and then fix the head fork to the treadmill.\n\tNOTE: The head fork and the treadmill are customized for the headplate used in this study, please see Supporting Materials for the corresponding cad files. Induction of mouse before head fixation is optional as it is possible to habituate animal for this procedure.\nMove the treadmill under the microscope stage and position the optical window under objective lens.",
    "Use a low magnification objective lens to find the best field of view (FOV) for functional imaging, then switch to a higher NA objective lens to record the neuronal activities at single-cell resolution.\n\tNOTE: If the injection cannula is still an obstacle for the objective lens to achieve its working distance, use a wire clipper to cut off the injection cannula from the head plate."
