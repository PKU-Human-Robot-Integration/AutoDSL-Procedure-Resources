    "1. Section and slide preparations\nTrim the paraffin blocks and use a microtome to cut 5 +/-1 µm sections. Mount the sections or cell pellets onto charged microscope slides in a 40-45 °C RNase free water bath. Air dry slides overnight at 37 °C or RT.\n\tNOTE: The slides can be stored for up to 3 months at room temperature (RT) and 6 months at 4 ˚C.\nDeparaffinize FFPE slides.\n\t\nBake slides in a dry oven for 1 h at 60 °C.\nIn a fume hood, fill two slide staining dishes with ~200 mL of fresh xylene, and two additional staining dishes with ~200 mL of fresh 100% ethanol. Cover the containers with lids.\nPlace the slides in a rack and submerge in the first xylene-containing dish. Incubate for 5-10 min at RT with agitation.\nPlace the slides into the second xylene-containing dish and incubate for 5-10 min at RT with agitation.\nImmediately place the slides in the dish containing 100% ethanol. Incubate the slides for 5-10 min at RT with agitation.\nImmediately place the slides in the second dish containing 100% ethanol and incubate for 5-10 min at RT with agitation.\nRemove the rack from the ethanol, gently tap the side of the rack to remove excess ethanol, and rinse in RNase free water for 5-15 min.\n2. Oven preparation\nTurn on the hybridization oven and set the temperature to 40 °C.\nPlace a cloth or sturdy absorbent paper towel in a tray and wet completely with double-distilled water to allow for humidity control.\nInsert the covered tray into the oven and close the oven door. Warm the tray for at least 30 min at 40 °C before use. Keep the tray in the oven when not in use.\n3. Heat-induced epitope retrieval",
    "Prepare 0.5x citrate based ISH hybridization target retrieval buffer (10 nmol/L, pH = 6, see Table of Materials). Bring it to a boil in a beaker on the heating plate.\nPerform heat-induced epitope retrieval by placing the slides into boiling target retrieval buffer for 30 min.\nRemove the slides from the target retrieval buffer and immediately wash in double-distilled water. Dehydrate in 100% ethanol for 5 min before air drying.\nOnce the slides have air-dried, apply hydrophobic barrier pen to encircle the tissue section on the slide. Be sure to allow the hydrophobic barrier to air dry completely.\n4. Protease pretreatment\nPlace the dried slides on a locking slide rack, then prepare the protease pretreatment reagents (protease digestion solution, 2.5 µg/mL) by diluting with sterile, cold, PBS in a 1:5 ratio. Mix well.\n\tNOTE: Three different protease reagents with different concentrations are provided in the commercially available kit. Protease III (standard), Protease IV (strong), and Protease Plus (mild). Empirically test the protease digestion time and dilution prior to implementation in a study because optimal conditions will vary based on tissue type, fixation, and thickness (see Discussion).\nDispense the diluted protease solution on slides to completely cover the tissue sections. Immediately incubate the slides for 20 min at 40 °C in an oven (prepared in step 1.4), ensuring that the slides are sealed in the humid hybridization tray. Do not let the tissue sections dry out for the remainder of the protocol.\nImmediately rinse 3x by submerging the locking slide rack into a wash tray filled with double-distilled water.\nPerform the endogenous peroxidase block by dropping the peroxidase solution onto each tissue section to completely cover it. Incubate the slides for 10 min at RT. Once done, rinse the sections 3x in double-distilled water.\n5. Probe hybridization and signal amplification",
    "NOTE: To prevent evaporation, make sure the humidity-controlled tray seals properly so that the tissues do not dry out during the incubation steps. Place the humidity chamber back in the oven during the washing step to ensure it remains at 40 °C.\nMix the C2 probe and C1 probe in a 1:50 ratio by pipetting 1 volume of C2 probe to 50 volumes of C1 probe into a tube as suggested by the manufacturer. Invert the tube several times. Prewarm the target probe mixture in 40 °C oven for ~10 min to dissolve any precipitation prior to use.\n\tNOTE: The mixed target probes can be stored at 4 °C for up to 6 months.\nRemove the slides from the water. Rinse, and tap or flick the slides to remove excess water from the tissue sections. Immediately dispense the probe on the slides, ensuring each tissue section is completely covered without any air bubbles. Incubate the probe mix in the humidity chamber overnight at 40 °C.\nThe next day, remove the slides from the oven and place them in the wash tray containing 0.5x wash buffer for 5 min at RT. Repeat the wash step one more time.\nRemove the slides from the wash buffer. Rinse, and tap or flick the slides to remove excess wash buffer from the tissue sections.\nDispense commercially AMP 1 reagent ready-to-use (2 nmol/L) in hybridization buffer B (20% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.3% lithiumdodecyl sulfate, 10% dextran sulfate, blocking reagents) on the slides, ensuring complete coverage of tissue section without any air bubbles. Incubate for 30 min at 40 °C in the humidity chamber. Repeat steps 1.6.3-1.6.4, performing the wash for 2 min each.",
    "Dispense commercially available AMP 2. Ensure that the tissue section is completely covered without any air bubbles. Incubate the slides in the humidity chamber for 15 min at 40 °C. Repeat steps 5.3-5.4, performing the wash for 2 min each.\nDispense commercially available AMP 3. Ensure that the tissue section is completely covered without any air bubbles. Incubate the slides in the humidity chamber for 30 min at 40 °C. Repeat steps 5.3-5.4, performing the wash for 2 min each.\nDispense commercially available AMP 4. Ensure that the tissue section is completely covered without any air bubbles. Incubate the slides in the humidity chamber for 15 min at 40 °C. Repeat steps 5.3-5.4, performing the wash for 2 min each.\nDispense commercially available AMP 5. Ensure that the tissue section is completely covered without any air bubbles. Incubate the slides in the humidity chamber for 30 min at 40 °C. Repeat step 5.3-5.4, performing the wash for 2 min each.\nDispense commercially available AMP 6. Ensure that the tissue section is completely covered without any air bubbles. Incubate the slides in the humidity chamber for 15 min at 40 °C. Repeat step 5.3-5.4, performing the wash for 2 min each.\nBefore detection, rinse the slides one time in 1x TBS-Tween 20 (0.05% v/v). Remove the slides from the wash buffer, rinse, and tap or flick the slides to remove excess wash buffer from the tissue sections. Immediately place in the wash tray filled with 1x TBS-Tween buffer.\n6. Channel 1 (C1) target signal detection\nNOTE: This is performed using the Red Alkaline Phosphatase and Fast Red Chromogen Amplification 6 from 2-plex detection kits (see Table of Materials) containing alkaline phosphatase labels, and chromogenic detection. It uses fast red as a substrate to generate a red signal.",
    "Prepare fast red (FR) working solution using a 1:60 dilution of Fast RED-B to Fast RED-A. Mix well. To reduce precipitate and obtain a cleaner signal, filter the chromogen solution through a 0.45 µm MCE membrane using a syringe.\n\tNOTE: Use the Fast RED-B solution within 5 min. Do not expose to direct sunlight or UV light.\nRemove the slides from the TBS-Tween, rinse, and tap or flick the slides to remove excess buffer from the tissue sections.\nDispense mixed, filtered FR solution onto each tissue section, being sure that each section is completely covered. Incubate at RT for 6-8 min. Observe under microscope.\nRinse the slides in 0.5x wash buffer 2x. Remove the slides from the wash buffer, rinse, and tap or flick the slides to remove excess wash buffer from the tissue sections.\nDispense commercially available AMP 7. Ensure that the tissue section is completely covered without any air bubbles. Incubate the slides in the humidity chamber for 10 min at 40 °C. Repeat step 5.3-5.4, performing the wash for 2 min each.\nDispense commercially available AMP 8. Ensure that the tissue section is completely covered without any air bubbles. Incubate the slides in the humidity chamber for 15 min at 40 °C. Repeat step 5.3-5.4, performing the wash for 2 min each.\nDispense commercially available AMP 9. Ensure that the tissue section is completely covered without any air bubbles. Incubate the slides in the humidity chamber for 30 min at 40 °C. Repeat step 5.3-5.4, performing the wash for 2 min each.\nDispense commercially available AMP 10. Ensure that the tissue section is completely covered without any air bubbles. Incubate the slides in the humidity chamber for 30 min at 40 °C. Repeat step 5.3-5.4, performing the wash for 2 min each.",
    "7. Channel 2 (C2) target signal detection\nNOTE: This is performed using commercially available Brown HRP and DAB Chromogen Kits (see Table of Materials). The amplification 10 from the 2-plex detection contains horseradish peroxidase labels, and chromogenic detection is performed using DAB to generate a brown signal.\nFor optimal detection of the DAB signal, use commercially available kits and follow the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials). Observe under a microscope.\n\tCAUTION: DAB is toxic. Follow appropriate precautions and safety guidelines when handling and disposing of this chemical.\n8. Counterstaining and mounting\nCounterstain the slides with hematoxylin.\n\t\nCounterstain the slides for 30 s with 50% fresh filtered hematoxylin while agitating the slides. Slides will appear purple. Immediately rinse in running water while agitating the slides up and down until the water is clear. The tissue sections will remain purple.\nTo obtain a better contrast, place counterstained slides in distilled water saturated with lithium carbonate for 1 min. Rinse in running water thoroughly at least 3x while agitating the slides. Use double-distilled water for the final rinse.\nBecause FR is sensitive to organic solvents, slides stained with FR will need to be covered with water-based mounting medium and dried overnight at RT.\nMount the slides.\n\t\nMake sure the tissue sections covered with water-based mounting medium are dry.\nDip slides in xylene before cover slipping using mounting reagent. Be sure to prevent or remove any air bubbles between the coverslip and tissue section and let dry for 16 hours at RT.\n9. Quantitative image analysis protocol for RNAscope using CellProfiler5\nBriefly, ensure that the software will separate hematoxylin and FR stains into separate images. Identify and measure the objects of interest: nuclei, virions, positive cells, and aggregate FR positive staining. Store measurements in a CSV file and save the analyzed image.",
    "Select the option to \"Unmix colors\", which separates stains, splitting the original region of interest (ROI) into separate hematoxylin and FR images.\nIf hemosiderin, tattoo, or similar features interfere with the analysis, add a second \"Unmix\" step with hematoxylin, FR, and DAB. Use the second FR image to find the most intense FR pixels. This second image will be used as a mask for true FR staining.\nOptionally, smooth the stained images before thresholding them. This is an empirical decision and not always needed. Threshold the individual stained images using \"IdentifyPrimaryObjects\" to select positive pixels.\nIdentify the three different types of objects (virion, virion aggregates, productive cell).\n\t\nEnsure that the nuclei are 4-100 pixels (px) diameter objects stained with hematoxylin. Declump and fill holes after thresholding. \"IntenseFastRed\" objects are 4-100 px diameter and include virions, positive cells, and aggregate positive staining, such as seen on follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) in B cell follicles (BCF). This image is used to filter out false positives (e.g., hemosiderin).\nEnsure that FR small positives are 2-12 px diameter objects. This measurement includes virions and vDNA+ cells. Discard any objects outside this range. Declump and fill holes after thresholding.\nEnsure that FR large positives: 9-100 px diameter objects. This measurement includes vRNA+ positive cells and aggregate positive staining. Declump after thresholding. The size of small and large FR positive objects can overlap. They will be separated in a later step.\n\t\tNOTE: The software (e.g., Cellprofiler) uses pixels for object sizes, and the ones used here are derived from slides scanned at 0.2510 µm/pixel (40x).\nDefine and extract results.\n\t\nAfter any objects are identified, define and extract results for number of virions, productive infected cells, and nuclei.\nIdentify virions by masking FastRedSmallPositives with the IntenseFastRed object set to remove false positives (e.g., hemosiderin).",
    "Next, identify the positive cells and aggregate FR positive staining. Remove false positives and virions from FastRedLargePositives by masking it with IntenseFastRed and with the virion object set.\nExtract positive cells from the refined FastRedLargePositives by masking again with Nuclei. Split objects that are no longer touching, and filter the results by object area, removing small objects (≤6 px). This removes the specks created by masking the nuclei overlap. The result is the positive cells.\nFinally, define aggregate FR positives. This step uses IdentifyTertiaryObjects, finding objects contained in a larger, parent object. In this case, the refined FastRedLargePositives object set is the parent and positive cells are subtracted.\nCount the number of virions and positive cells.\nMeasure the aggregate positive area and convert it from pixels to mm2. Optionally, record the area occupied by virions and positive cells in mm2 if the analysis requires using a standard cell and virion sizes instead of direct counts.\nOverlay the positive objects on the original image and save the result.\n\tNOTE: The ISH data is reported by the number of virions per 106 nuclei (cells) and the number of productively infected vRNA+ cells per 106 nuclei (cells) for a better understanding and to facilitate comparison with qPCR data, but results could also be reported by area of tissue in mm2."
