    "NOTE: All animal procedures were performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Cincinnati and in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals from the National Institutes of Health (NIH Publication No. 85-23, Revised 1996).\n1. Euthanize and Sterilize the Mouse\nPlace the mouse in a dropbox containing a supratheraputic dose of isoflurane and allow to inhale to effect. Once the mouse is euthanized, remove from the box.\nCervically dislocate as a second means of euthanasia.\nSterilize the external surface of the mouse by cleansing the animal with 70% ethanol.\n2. Identification and Isolation of Three Different Adipose Depots\nBrown Adipose Tissue (BAT) Isolation:\n\t\nMake sure the fur is wet from the alcohol cleansing to aid in cutting through the epidermal and dermal layers.\nPosition the mouse in a supine position with its back against the table.\nGrab the skin just below the diaphragm with forceps, lift and incise with scissors.\nCut transversely around the circumference of the mouse to expose the peritoneum.\nReveal the butterfly-shaped BAT depot by degloving the top half of the mouse. Hold the lower appendages and abdomen in one hand and pulling the skin up towards the head.\nOrient the mouse, so that it is positioned prone on the table. Be careful not to contaminate the exposed depot with hair.\nClean surgical instruments and change to a fresh pair of gloves.\nLocate the scapulae and corresponding depot. Carefully remove any superficial white adipose atop the butterfly and then dissect the butterfly of interscapular brown fat. Be careful to avoid the muscle closely associated with the brown fat.",
    "NOTE: The use of a dissection microscope is recommended for removal of the white adipose, as well as in the separation of the brown adipose from the scapulae.\nRemove fat depot and transfer to a 2 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nIf RNA or protein is to be extracted, freeze the tissue by immersion in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C. Freeze the sample at once to prevent degradation. If culturing, cover the tissue in DMEF-12 and set on ice till all samples are collected for culture (supplemental info).\nIsolation of Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue (SQ), a White Adipose Tissue Depot (WAT):\n\t\nPut on a fresh pair of gloves as to not cross-contaminate between fat depots.\nReveal the inguinal, triangular SQ depots by de-gloving the bottom half of the mouse. Hold the upper appendages and thorax in one hand and pulling the skin down towards the feet with the other hand.\nOrient the mouse in a supine position while being careful not to contaminate the exposed depot with hair.\nClean surgical instruments and change to a fresh pair of gloves.\nCarefully dissect the triangles of SQ fat. Be careful not to contaminate the sample with muscle, neighboring fat, mammary glands or by cutting any vessels and contaminate the sample with blood.\n\t\tNOTE: The use of a dissection microscope is recommended if borders are not clearly defined.\nRemove fat depots and transfer to 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes.\nIf RNA or protein is to be extracted, freeze the tissue by immersion in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C. Freeze the sample at once to prevent degradation.\nFor staining, fix or embed in OCT. If culturing, cover the tissue in DMEF-12 and set on ice till all samples are collected for culture (supplemental info).",
    "Isolation of Gonadal Fat a Visceral Adipose Tissue (VAT) and White Adipose Tissue (WAT) Depot:\n\t\nPut on a fresh pair of gloves as to not cross-contaminate between fat depots.\nWith scissors, cut the peritoneum transversely, directly below the diaphragm. Cut the peritoneum from the diaphragm to the rectum mid coronally to expose abdominal organs.\nLocate the testes or ovaries and identify the attached white adipose tissue, known as the epididymal adipose in males or gonadal adipose in females.\nClean surgical instruments and change to a fresh pair of gloves\nCarefully dissect both epididymal fat depots from the testes, epididymides, and vasa deferentia. Or if female, carefully dissect both gonadal fat pads from the ovaries.\nRemove fat depots and transfer them to 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes.\nIf RNA or protein is to be extracted, freeze the tissue by immersion in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C. Freeze the sample at once to prevent degradation.\nFor staining, fix or embed in OCT. If culturing, cover the tissue in DMEF-12 and set on ice till all samples are collected for culture (supplemental info).\n3. Isolation of Perivascular Adipose Tissue (PVAT)\nIsolation of the Heart:\n\t\nLay the mouse out in a supine position with upper and lower appendages extended outward.\nSecure appendages using surgical tape.\nAfter positioning the mouse as listed above, create tension by lifting up on the xiphoid process with forceps. Cut horizontally through the diaphragm, exposing the lower portion of the thoracic cavity.\nWhile maintaining tension, by lifting up on the xiphoid process, cut through the ribcage superiorly towards the head, just to the side of the sternum.",
    "Pick up the rib cage just inferior to the clavicle, and cut along the inferior length of the clavicle out toward the axilla in both directions. The thoracic cavity and its contents (heart, lungs, etc.) should now be clearly visible.\nClean the thoracic cavity of extraneous blood and fluid by using sterile gauze to absorb the fluid. If collecting organs or vessels be sure to profuse (supplemental info).\nOnce the area is cleared of fluid, cut the bronchi and attaching vessels to remove the lungs, allowing better exposure of the heart.\nLocalization and Excision of Aortic Perivascular Adipose Tissue (PVAT):\n\t\nRemove the following organs as to better identify the inferior portions of the aorta: liver, stomach, spleen, pancreas, intestines, and colon.\nFirst start with identification of the stomach and the esophagus. Cut the esophagus at the gastro-esophageal junction to free the stomach from the body.\nNext, identify the intestines and the surrounding mesentery. Cut superficially through mesentery, as it lies very closely to the renal portion of the aorta, then “run the bowel.”\nCut the colon free as close to the rectum as possible. Thus, freeing the stomach, intestine and colon from the mouse.\nRemove the stomach, intestine, colon, pancreas and spleen by cutting through the attaching mesentery and vessels. The pancreas and spleen should come free with the stomach, intestine and colon.\nRemove the liver by cutting through the hepatic veins and attaching mesentery, remove all lobes.\nCut away the visceral layer and fat surround the kidneys. Leave the kidneys attached to the aorta in vivo to serve as geographic markers for different segments of the aorta.\nRinse the area with sterile 1x PBS and remove all fluid by absorption with a sterile gauze.",
    "Using micro-scissors and micro-forceps, separate the aorta from its dorsal attachment to the spine and its ventral attachment to the esophagus.\nIsolate the aorta by following and detaching the aorta the length of the descending aorta from the origin in the heart to the bifurcation in the iliac region.\nIdentify and isolate the subclavian vessels. Isolate these vessels from the neck to the aortic root to better expose the aortic junction and root in the heart.\nRemove the thymus then cut the brachiocephalic artery, the left common carotid artery, and the left subclavian artery, allowing movement of the heart.\nWith the assistance of a dissection microscope, view the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) layer surrounding the aorta.\nTaking great care to not pinch or squeeze the PVAT, gently pull the PVAT way from the aorta with micro-forceps. Gently cut the attachment of the PVAT to the aorta with micro-scissors starting at the thoracic region just superior to where the diaphragm is located.\n\t\tNOTE: A dissection microscope is recommended.\nRepeat this process the entire length of the aorta, finishing at the infrarenal aortic region, which is located just superior to the iliac bifurcation of the aortic vessel.\nIf aortic arch PVAT is desired, used the same method to remove the PVAT from the lesser curvature of the arch.\nPlace PVAT samples into 2 ml microcentrifuge tube(s).\nIf RNA or protein is to be extracted, freeze the tissue by immersion in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C. Freeze the sample at once to prevent degradation. If culturing, cover the tissue in DMEF-12 and set on ice till all samples are collected for culture (supplemental info).\n\t\tNOTE: Additional adipose depots to consider if interested in a comprehensive adipose depot analysis include: retroperitoneal, mesenteric, omental, pericardial and popliteal.",
