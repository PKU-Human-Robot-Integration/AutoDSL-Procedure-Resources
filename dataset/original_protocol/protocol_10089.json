    "All experiments adhered to the ethics committee guidelines from the Texas Heart Institute.\n1. Organ Preparation\nNOTE: In collaboration with LifeGift, a nonprofit organ procurement organization in Texas (http://www.lifegift.org), donated human hearts not suitable for transplant were used for research with approved consent.\nTo procure hearts, intravenously infuse 30,000 U heparin to the hearts. Securely suture cardioplegia cannula in the aorta and attach a clamped perfusion line. Perforate the inferior vena cava (IVC) to vent the right heart. Cut either the left superior pulmonary vein or the left atrial appendage to vent the left chambers of the heart.\nInfuse 1 L of cardioplegia or heparinized saline. Dissect aortic arch branches, superior vena cava (SVC) and other pulmonary veins to release the heart from any vascular or surrounding tissue attachment. Submerge the well-heparinized heart in iced saline solution.\nInspect the donated human heart (both anteriorly and posteriorly, Figure 1). Place the heart on a dissecting tray and inspect for any structural damage or anatomical malformations. If liver and/or lungs were procured for transplantation, the heart may present with a short inferior vena cava and/or absence of left atrial posterior wall.\nPerform internal inspection for possible defects - atrial septal defect (ASD), ventricular septal defect (VSD), or valve (aortic, pulmonary, mitral, tricuspid) malformation.\nIf a septal defect is present, correct it with appropriate sutures (Figure 2A, 2B). The correction of septal defects is needed to monitor decellularization progress via pulmonary artery (PA) outflow turbidity measurement. Correction of the septal defect removes left to right shunt, hence, the outflow from PA represents the outflow from the coronary circulation through the coronary sinus.\nLigate superior and inferior vena cava with 2-0 silk suture (Figure 2C).\nDissect the aorta (Ao) away from the main PA (Figure 2D) for subsequent cannulation.",
    "Insert connectors, based on the diameter of the vessel, (Figure 3) into Ao and PA and secure them with 2-0 silk sutures (Figure 4A).\nInsert a tubing line through the left atrium (Figure 4B) and toward the left ventricle (LV) (Figure 3), using one of the pulmonary vein orifices.\nConnect an infusion line to the connector placed in the Ao and the outflow line to the one in the PA (Figure 3).\nPlace the prepared heart into a polyester pouch in inverted orientation (upside down).\nPlace the pouch with heart into a perfusion container and close the lid (Figure 4C).\nConnect each of the lines to the respective ports in the rubber stopper (based on the diameter of container) and insert it to the lid of the perfusion container to seal the polyester pouch (Figure 4C and Figure 5B).\nPerfuse 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (136 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4 and 1.8 mM KH2PO4 in distilled water, pH 7.4) via the infusion port of the rubber stopper to verify outflow from the PA and from the line inserted into LV.\nUse this flow to clean the organ of any residual traces of blood in the vasculature. If flow is not observed, tighten the connection lines as they might be loose.\n2. System Setup and Organ Decellularization Procedure\nAssemble the bioreactor and place in an upright orientation (Figure 5). The perfusion system includes a personal computer (PC), proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller, a peristaltic pump for Ao infusion, a perfusion bioreactor, a pressure head container for LV perfusate retention (2L aspirator bottle with bottom sidearm), and a peristaltic pump to drain excess fluid from the pressure head container and to collect the outflow from PA.",
    "In the rubber septum, connect the infusion line, pressure-head line, PA-outflow line and bioreactor draining line to the rubber cap surface ports placed on top of the perfusion bioreactor (Figure 5A).\nDecellularize hearts under constant pressure of 120 mmHg measured at the aortic root. Mean pressure of the LV should be within 14-18 mmHg throughout the whole decellularization process.\nDecellularize hearts as follows: 4 h of hypertonic solution (500 mM NaCl), 2 h of hypotonic solution (20 mM NaCl), 120 h of sodium dodecyl sulfate (1% SDS) solution, and a final wash with 120 L of 1X PBS (Figure 6A).\nDecellularize the hearts under constant pressure control (120 mmHg). Infusion flow rate into Ao is heart-dependent and is, on average, 98.06±16.22 mL/min for hypertonic solution, 76.14±7.90 mL/min for hypotonic solution, 151.50±5.76 mL/min for SDS, and 185.24±7.10 mL/min for PBS. The total consumed volume of each reagent averages 23.36±5.70 L for hypertonic solution and 9.13±1.26 L for hypotonic solution.\nRecirculate the final 60 L of 1% SDS (1 L per gram of heart weight) until the end of SDS perfusion. Figure 6A shows a timeline for the decellularization process, eliciting endpoints for data collection: flow rate monitoring (Ao and PA) and outflow collection (PA and non-PA) from pressure head during decellularization.\nSince the SVC and IVC are ligated, it is reasonable to assume that all fluid collected from the PA is the result of actual coronary perfusion (Figure 5B). Determine coronary perfusion efficiency by directly dividing the flow rate of perfusate out of the PA by the flow rate of infused solution into Ao:\n\tCoronary perfusion efficiency = imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58123/58123eq1.jpg (%).",
    "Perform comparative analysis of the perfusate obtained from the PA and the LV and the infused solutions in duplicate by loading 200 μL per well in a clear bottom 96-well plate and reading absorbance at 280 nm. The absorbance value, selected empirically after trying different values, was found to give the best normalized values.\nUse the turbidity of clean infused reagent as the control. The turbidity of the outflow perfusate represents washout of cell debris and can be quantified instantly during decellularization as a tracking tool of the process.\nDuring the final wash with 10 L of 1X PBS, add 500 mL of sterile neutralized 2.1% peracetic acid solution, neutralized with 10N NaOH, leading to a 0.1% peracetic acid solution (v/v) in PBS. Use this solution to sterilize the scaffold.\n3. Evaluation of Decellularized Hearts\nNOTE: After decellularization, representative hearts will be used for coronary angiogram imaging and biochemical assays.\nPerform coronary angiography of the representative decellularized human heart to examine the intactness of the coronary vasculature. Briefly, using a fluoroscope, image decellularized human heart after injection of contrast agent through coronary ostial cannula in the main right and left coronary arteries.\nDissect the decellularized heart to get samples from 19 areas to evaluate the remaining deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and SDS levels in decellularized tissues. Remove the base of the heart from ventricles and dissect the ventricles into 4 equal sections (Figure 6C). Divide each section into the anterior and posterior right ventricle (RV), the anterior and posterior LV, and the interventricular septum (IVS). The tissue containing the apex is dissected into the LV and RV for sampling.\nCut tissue samples for DNA, GAG and SDS assays (~15 mg of wet weight).",
    "Extract double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) by digesting samples in 1 M NaOH for 3 h at 65 °C and adjust pH to 7 using 10x Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer and 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl).\nQuantify dsDNA using a dsDNA Assay kit with a calf thymus standard (see Table of Materials). Read samples in duplicate using a fluorescence microplate reader (excitation at 480 nm and emission at 520 nm). Calculate the percentage of residual dsDNA in the decellularized hearts by comparing dsDNA concentration in each tissue to that in cadaveric (% cadaveric).\nObtain sulfated GAGs into solution by digesting tissue samples in a papain extraction solution (0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer with EDTA disodium salt, cysteine HCl, sodium acetate, and papain) at 65 °C for 3 hours. Measure GAG content (in duplicate) by using a Glycosaminoglycan Assay Kit.\nLyophilize samples for SDS assay in a heated vacuum and measure dry weight. Add 200 µL of ultrapure water to each dried sample and homogenize to extract the residual SDS into solution. Mix this SDS solution to chloroform and a methylene blue solution (12 mg of methylene blue in 1 L of 0.01 M HCl). The SDS will separate in the organic layer by binding to the methylene blue dye.\nUsing a fluorescence microplate reader, read the absorbance (655 nm) of the standards and samples in duplicate to calculate the residual SDS. Normalize this SDS value to tissue dry weight.\nImage samples from thick regions (i.e., LV, RV and septum) of human heart with nonlinear optical microscopy (NLOM) to confirm cellular removal after decellularization. The NLOM setup is detailed in our previous publications18,19,20. NLOM enables us to image cell, elastin, collagen and myosin fibers through its two-photon fluorescence (TPF) and second harmonic generation (SHG) channels without using any exogenous stain or dye21.",
