    "NOTE: This protocol describes the fabrication of a 3D model of the carotid artery and can be applied to generate any other artery of interest by simply modifying the geometric parameters.\n1. Design and fabrication of a 3D bifurcation of the human carotid artery model\nChoose images from patients or previously studied geometries of the human carotid artery bifurcation, and create a computer-aided design model of the mold that needs to be printed.\n\tNOTE: The carotid artery bifurcation has one inlet and two outlets. It is important to design a 3D mold frame around the artery and temporary printing supports between the frame and the artery mold (Figure 2A-C).\nPrint the geometries using a 3D printer. Cut the temporary printing supports, and use sandpaper to polish and smooth the molds, especially in the areas where the supports were cut. Rinse the sanded model with isopropyl alcohol to remove the plastic dust, and allow to completely dry in a chemical hood for 2-3 h.\n\tNOTE: Here, the printed molds were made of clear resin v4 (Figure 2D,E).\nTo easily dissolve the plastic, spray the molds with transparent lacquer inside a chemical hood, and allow to air-dry for 1 h. Repeat this 3x.\n\tNOTE: Here, 2X Ultra Cover Clear Spray was used, but any other kind should be suitable as long as it is not wood lacquer. Confirm that there is no exposed plastic left because the plastic may react with the silicone and prevent it from properly solidifying. The quality of the sprayed surface will determine the quality of the surface of the final silicone model.",
    "Cut transparent rectangular slides/strips of smooth plastic of the same dimensions as the mold frame, and glue them using the lacquer to the frame on all sides and from one side of the frame, such that it will be sealed at the bottom and open at the top. Apply the lacquer using a paint brush inside a chemical hood, and allow the slides to completely dry for at least 24 h (Figure 2F).\nTo prepare the silicone rubber mixture, add liquid silicone with its curing agent (mass ratio 1:10) in a plastic plate, and stir thoroughly to ensure complete mixing. For the carotid model, add 54 g of the silicone and 6 g of its curing agent.\nCool the mixture for 15 min at 4 °C, then degas it in a vacuum desiccator until all the air bubbles have been eliminated. Place the mold in the desiccator (with the open side facing up), slowly pour the silicone mixture into the mold, and again remove the air bubbles until the mixture is clear.\nLet the mold stand with the silicone overnight at room temperature (if possible, leave it in the desiccator without vacuum). If the mixture has not fully dried, incubate it at 60 °C for another few hours.\nOnce the mixture is fully dry, remove the transparent slides, and immerse the model in absolute acetone for 48 h in a chemical hood until the plastic is fully dissolved. Remove any plastic leftovers with a wooden stick. To evaporate the acetone trapped inside the model, incubate it at 60 °C for at least 4 days before cell seeding.\n2. Cell culture and seeding in models",
    "Prepare three connectors for the carotid model: one for the inlet and two for the outlets (see Table of Materials). Sterilize the model and the connectors by ultraviolet irradiation in a biological hood for 20 min.\nCoat the models with 4 mL of 100 µg/mL fibronectin (in 1x phosphate-buffered saline, (PBS)) for 2 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. Inject the fibronectin solution into the model through the inlet using a 5 or 10 mL plastic syringe. Remove the fibronectin through the outlet, and wash the model with EC medium.\nSuspend 2.5 × 106 cells/mL human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs, passage < 6), and fill the model with 4 mL of the cell suspension using a 5 or 10 mL plastic syringe (Figure 3A). Place the model on a rotator inside an incubator (37 °C) at a speed of 1 rpm for 48 h to ensure homogeneous seeding. Make sure the model is well-attached to the rotator (Figure 3B). Change the medium after 24 h inside a biological hood, and return to the rotator inside the incubator for another 24 h.\n\tNOTE: After 24 h, the cells are seeded and can be imaged using a microscope.\nRemove the model from the rotator, and wash with 1x PBS using a 10 mL plastic syringe. To fix the cells, incubate the cells with 4 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) to the model for 15 min inside a chemical hood, and then rinse 3x with PBS. Add 4 mL of PBS, and store at 4 °C until the experiment (Figure 3C). Stain the cells inside the model using standard staining protocols (e.g., nuclear staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), Figure 3D).\n3. Design of the perfusion system",
    "The perfusion system has two inlets and two outlet tubes. Merge the two inlets into a single 4 mm ID tube and again into two 6 mm ID tubes, which connect to the peristaltic pump. Merge the two 6 mm ID tubes coming out of the peristaltic pump into a single 4 mm tube, and connect it to an oscillation damper to eliminate any oscillations from the pump. Use a 250 mL narrow-mouthed bottle with a three-orifice lid as the damper.\nConnect one orifice to the inlet from the pump, close the second with a cork that is used for pressure venting in emergencies, and extend the third orifice (which is the outlet) to the bottom of the bottle.\nConnect the damper to the inlet of the cultured carotid model using the outlet tubing. Merge the two outlets of the model to one tubing, which will be the outlet of the system (All tubing are 4 mm ID).\nSplit the outlet tubing to two outlet tubes (one for the closed circuit and the other for the waste container in the open circuit). Attach a plastic clamp to each tube.\n\tNOTE: The combination of open/closed clamps will determine whether the system is in a closed or open circuit configuration. As shown in Figure 1, if clamps a and d are close while b and c are open, the system is a closed circuit; the reverse brings the system to open circuit configuration.\nPrepare three containers: one that can hold 300 mL fluid (for closed-circuit) and two others of 1 L each: one for washing and the other for waste (for open circuit).\n4. Closed-circuit configuration: perfusion experiment and imaging",
    "Add 300 mL of PBS to the closed-circuit container, which is sufficient to fill the entire system, including the tubing and the model. Place one inlet tube and one outlet tube (open clamps b and c) inside the container.\nFill the 1 L washing container with distilled water (for washing at the end of the experiment), and leave the other 1 L waste container empty. Place the other inlet and outlet tubing (close clamps a and d) in the washing and waste containers, respectively.\nTake the fixed cell cultured carotid model out of 4 °C storage, and empty the PBS. Connect the inlet and outlets of the carotid as described in steps 3.3-3.4. Do not leave the model dry for a long time. Once the model is connected, activate the pump to perfuse fluid.\nPlace the carotid model under the microscope. Open the tubing before the inlet and after the outlet of the carotid model. Set the peristaltic pump at 10 rpm, and turn it on. Increase the speed in increments of 5 rpm, every 4-5 min. Make sure there are no leakages.\nAt 100 rpm, which equals the maximum flow rate of the physiological waveform of the human carotid artery (~400 mL/min), add fluorescent carboxylated polystyrene (PS) particles (2 µm, at a concentration of 1.6 µg/mL) to the 300 mL of PBS in the closed-circuit container. Image the region of interest every 10 s for 1.5 h (still single images or video as needed).\n5. Open-circuit configuration: the washing step",
    "Open the clamps of the washing and waste tubes in the 1 L containers (clamps a and d), and immediately close the clamps of both the inlet and outlet tubes in the 300 mL container (clamps b and c) to change the system from a closed to open circuit configuration.\nLet most of the water flow from the washing container to the waste container at 100 rpm. Before it is completely transferred, press stop on the peristaltic pump, and close the tube clamps before the inlet and after the outlet of the carotid model.\nUsing the appropriate filters, capture images of the model at the region of interest to show the deposition and adhesion of particles to the cells. Disconnect the carotid model. Carefully and slowly add 4 mL of PBS with a 10 mL syringe through the model's inlet.\nConnect a \"dummy model\", (which is also a silicone rubber 3D carotid model used only for washing, without cultured cells) instead of the carotid model, and rinse the system. Add another 1 L of water, and wash the system again until all the water is transferred from the washing container to the waste. Turn off the peristaltic pump.\n6. Data acquisition and analysis\nAcquire a digital movie of particle deposition at the region of interest with the images taken during the experiment, using a customized software code (see the Table of Materials).\nFor mapping of the deposition of the particles along the model, tile multiple images to cover the examined region of interest (Figure 4A,B).\n\tNOTE: A customized software code can be written to quantify the number of adhered particles at a site of interest (a sample file has been provided as Supplemental Information)17.\nSubscription Required.
