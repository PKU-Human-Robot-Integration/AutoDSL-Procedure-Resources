    "This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital. Every enrolled subject signed a written informed consent.\n1. Sample Classification and Screening\nDiagnose and divide 116 patients into AD and MCI groups.\n\tNOTE: Use the 2011 National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) diagnostic criteria and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) criteria for identification and classification of MCI, which is described in detail in Yu et al.10\nSelect participants in the healthy control group.\n\tNOTE: The age, gender, and education level of the control group were matched with patients in the MCI and AD groups.\nAssess all subjects by MMSE10.\nExclude the subjects who did not fulfill the inclusion criteria. For all subjects, the exclusion criteria are mentioned in Yu et al.10\nUse MRI to scan subjects; exclude subjects with unusable data due to head movements.\n\tNOTE: Ultimately, we screened 26 patients with MCI, 32 patients with AD, and 58 controls.\n2. Acquisition of Neuroimaging\nRemove metal and magnetic objects before entering the 3.0 T MRI Laboratory.\nInstall an MRI receiving coil at the magnetic resonance scanning bed. The receiving coil is an 8 channel circularly polarized brain phased-array coil.\nInstruct the participant to lie on the bed, and to remain supine with the head advanced and the long axis of the body along the long axis of the bed. Place the participant's head on the bracket of the coil, and make sure that the orbitomeatal line is perpendicular to bed.",
    "Tell the participant to place the upper limbs to the sides of the body, keep eyes closed, not think of anything in particular, and move as little as possible during the scan. Place foam pads on the head in the bilateral temporal area to prevent head movement and provide headphones to reduce scanner noise for the participant.\n\tNOTE: Dimensions of the foam pad are: long diameter = 13 cm, short diameter = 10 cm, the thickest thickness = 7 cm, the thinnest thickness = 3 cm, average thickness = 5 cm.\nAdjust the position of the head through the positioning light so that the sagittal positioning cursor is in the midline of the face, and the axis positioning cursor is parallel to the lateral canthus. Then move the bed to keep the axis positioning cursor on the eyebrows or 2 cm below it.\nMove the head to the center of the magnet. Perform an fMRI brain scan, including gradient Echo-Planar Imaging (EPI-BOLD) and 3D-T1-MPRAGE imaging.\n\tNOTE: Use the following parameters:\n\tEPI-BOLD: TR/TE = 2,000/30 ms, layer thickness/layer pitch = 3.2/0.8 mm, 31 slices, matrix = 64 x 64, FOV = 220 x 220 mm, voxel size = 3 x 3 x 4 mm, flip angle = 90 °, scanning time of 484 s, and a total of 240 scanning images.\n\t3D-T1-MPRAGE imaging: TR/TE = 8.5/3.2 ms, flip angle = 15 °, field of view = 250 x 250 mm, matrix = 256 x 256, slice number = 176, slice thickness/gap = 1/0 mm, scanning time of 353 s, and a total of 192 scanning images.\nKeep the patient safe when they are leaving the bed at the end of the scan.\n3. Data Preprocessing",
    "NOTE: Analyze the raw data for resting-state brain functions by using the Resting-State fMRI (rs-fMRI) Data Analysis Toolkit plus (RESTplus).\nOpen RESTplus through MATLAB and left click on Pipeline.\nImport the relevant files into RESTplus. Select the work directory and then the starting EPI and T1 directories.\nConvert DICOM files to NIFTI. Check off the DICOM to NIFTI box in preprocessing and check off the EPI DICOM to NIFTU and the T1 DICOM to NIFTI parameters.\nRemove the first 10 time points by checking off the Remove first n time points and setting the n parameter as 10.\nSet the slice timing according to rs-fMRI parameters. Check off the Slice timing box. Set the slice number according to the rs-fMRI parameters of the study. Enter the slice order.\n\tNOTE: The acquisition of data of each layer in the brain scan is not at the same time point, and thus, it needs to be calibrated to the same time point.\nCorrect the time and head motion. Check off Realign.\n\tNOTE: The exclusion criterion for excessive head motion was >2.0 mm translation or >2.0 ° rotation in any direction. In the RESTplus this is a default parameter (left click on the option of 'Realign').\nPerform spatial normalization by using T1 image unified segmentation and all heads standardized to the same space. Check off Normalize and leave the default parameters at the bottom. Select the Normalize by using T1 image unified segmentation and European parameters.\n\tNOTE: Resample the rs-fMRI images with voxels of 3 × 3 × 3 mm, and other parameters in the RESTplus are default, just left click on the option of 'Normalize by using T1 image unified segmentation'.\nPerform spatial smoothing using an isotropic Gaussian kernel with a full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 6 mm. Check off Smooth.",
    "Remove the linear trend by checking off Detrend.\nRegress out signals from nuisance regressors (WM, CSF, Global) to increase signal-to-noise ratio. Check off Nuisance covariates regression and the following parameters: 6 head motion parameters, global mean signal, white matter signal, and cerebrospinal fluid signal.\n\tNOTE: During this step, set the 'Polynomial trend' as 1 as default, and choose the '6 head motion parameters', the 'Nuisance regressors (WM, CSF, Global)' and the 'add mean back' as default.\nUse band-pass filtering to retain signals between 0.01 - 0.08 Hz. Remove high-frequency physiological noise, and low-frequency drift. Check off Filter.\n4. Directed Connectivity Analysis\nNOTE: Perform GCA combined with the BOLD signals for each voxel in the whole brain after extracting the average BOLD signal intensity in the seed area.\nPerform the voxel-wise GCA by using the REST-GCA in the REST toolbox. In the post-processing box, check off GCA.\nSet the 'order' as 1 as default. Select the parameters in the input.\nDefine ROI and identify seed points of interest in the PCC. Select Define ROI and choose the Spherical ROI. Select Next. Set the center coordinates and radius of the seed ROI based on the known data and select OK.\n\tNOTE: An ROI for the DMN was placed at the PCC (centering at x = 0, y = -53, z = 26 with radius = 6 mm), as in a previous study13.\nSelect Run and OK to run the program.\nFind folders named ZGCA and GCA after processing of relevant file data. Sort out the files of ZGCA and classify them into four subfolders, xx, xy, yx, yy accordingly.\n\tNOTE: Later, mainly use the xy and yx subfolders. The three sets of file data ('AD' 'MCI' 'NC') are all processed and sorted according to steps 3.1 - 4.5 above.",
    "Open RESTplus through MATLAB and left click on Statistical Analysis. Left click on REST Two-Sample T-Test.\nName the output result as T1xy and set the output directory. Left click on Add Group Images to open the xy subfolder in the AD Results folder and the xy subfolder in the NC Results folder.\nIn the option of Mask File, left click to open the BrainMask_05_61*73*61 subfile in the 'mask' folder.\nSelect Compute to run the program.\nName the output result as T2xy and set the output directory. Left click on Add Group Images to open the xy subfolder in the AD Results folder and the xy subfolder in the MCI Results folder. Repeat steps 4.8 - 4.9.\nName the output result as T3xy and set the output directory. Left click on Add Group Images to open the xy subfolder in the MCI Results folder and the xy subfolder in the NC Results folder. Repeat steps 4.8 - 4.9.\nName the output result as T1yx and set the output directory. Left click on Add Group Images to open the yx subfolder in the AD Results folder and the yx subfolder in the NC Results folder. Repeat steps 4.8 - 4.9.\nName the output result as T2yx and set the output directory. Left click on Add Group Images to open the yx subfolder in the AD Results folder and the yx subfolder in the MCI Results folder. Repeat steps 4.8 - 4.9.\nName the output result as T3yx and set the output directory. Left click on Add Group Images to open the yx subfolder in the MCI Results folder and the yx subfolder in the NC Results folder. Repeat steps 4.8 - 4.9.",
    "Finally, obtain the six result files by following steps 4.6 - 4.14 and left click on viewer of RESTplus to view the result. Import the template named ch2 in Underlay.\nFind the six result files in the output directory and fill in the Overlay one by one. Obtain the final result graph, and the six result files that correspond to the six graphs.\nUse Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) to process the data obtained from the previous step.\n\t\nPresent Continuous variables as means and Standard Deviations (SD).\nPresent categorical variables as numbers and percentages, then use the chi-square test.\n\t\tNOTE: All p-values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.\nSubscription Required.
