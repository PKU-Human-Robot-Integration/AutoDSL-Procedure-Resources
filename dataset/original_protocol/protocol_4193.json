    "Incubation assay for Streptomyces spores   Suspensions of freshly harvested spores, which were washed with water and filtered twice through cotton wool (Kieser et al., 2000), were adjusted to an OD450nm of 10 or 20 (1 ml of an OD450 = 1 is equivalent to 3.5 x 108 spores ml−1 or 2.37 x 108 cfu.).   For the assay, 500 μl of the spore suspension was added to 500 μl of buffer (100 mM MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, 10 mM sodium nitrate) in gas-tight Hungate vials. The gas in the 15 ml headspace was exchanged against pure nitrogen and flushed with nitrogen for an additional 5 min through the closed septum.   Hungate vials were incubated by slowly shaking at 30 °C for 5 h, or longer as necessary if the anticipated enzyme activity was low.   At a defined time after starting the incubation the nitrate reduction reaction in these samples was terminated by heating the vials with the spores at 80 °C for 10 min. The heat-killed spores were then pelleted by centrifugation in a bench-top centrifuge (20,000 x g) for 5 min.   The spore-free supernatant was used for nitrite determination either immediately or was stored at -20 °C until required.      Incubation assay for Streptomyces mycelia grown in TSB liquid culture   Suspensions of freshly grown, highly dispersed mycelium were washed twice with MOPS-buffer, and adjusted to the desired amount of mycelium using the methylene blue adsorption method (Fischer and Sawers, 2013; see notes below) (1,000 CAE are comparable with a dry weight of 1 mg Streptomyces mycelium growing in TSB.).   For the assay, 500 μl of the mycelium suspension were added to 500 μl of buffer (100 mM MOPS-NaOH, pH 7.0, 10 mM sodium nitrate) in gas-tight Hungate vials.",
    "The gas in the 15 ml headspace was exchanged against pure nitrogen and flushed with nitrogen for an additional 5 min through the closed septum.   The Hungate vials were incubated by slowly shaking at 30 °C for 30 min, or longer as necessary.   For the determination of rates of nitrate reduction in mycelium, samples were removed at different times. The nitrate reduction reaction in these samples was terminated by heating the vials at 80 °C for 10 min.   The mycelium-free supernatant, obtained by centrifuging the vials for 5 min at 5,000 x g in a bench-top centrifuge, was used for nitrite determination.      Nitrite determination in the supernatant of bacterial cultures (Rider and Mellon, 1946)   Aliquots (0.5 ml) of the supernatants were mixed by briefly pipetting up and down twice with one volume of freshly prepared sulfanilic acid solution and incubated at room temperature for at least 5 min. If the absorbance levels were too high, then supernatants were appropriately diluted (1:5 or 1:10) prior to repeating the nitrite determination assay.   Subsequently, a half volume of N-(1-naphthyl)-ethylenediamine solution was added and the incubation was continued for exactly 10 min.   The absorption was measured at 540 nm and the nitrite concentration was calculated using a calibration curve with nitrite."
