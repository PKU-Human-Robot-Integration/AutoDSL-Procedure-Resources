    "NOTE: The animals received humane care in compliance with the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” prepared by the Institute of Laboratory Animal Resources, National Research Council. The animal experimentation committee of the Utrecht University approved the protocol.\n1. The Coronary Anastomosis Procedure\n  NOTE: Always use laser protection glasses when the laser is active.\nMounting of the Trinity Clip\n\t\nOpen the upper fork of the connector3 (Figure 1) with the Aneurysm clip applier (Figure 4A) and insert into the lumen of the perfused graft, directed distally (Figure 5A). Make sure the full length of the fork is positioned intraluminally. Subsequently, release the applicator.\nOcclude the mammary artery proximally with an atraumatic bulldog clip and carefully rinse the grafts’ lumen with a heparin-saline solution. Subsequently, introduce the laser catheter4 (Figure 2) intravascularly, through the distal free end of the graft, into the connector, and fixate it by the external fixation clip (Figure 3).\nInitiate vacuum suction through the catheter onto the graft (to apply vacuum through the catheter, connect a vacuum tube to the catheter and to a vacuum pump), activate the laser and laser-punch the graft a vue, resulting in an anastomotic orifice of 0.8 by 2.0 mm. Release the vacuum suction directly after lasering. Visually check if the arterial wall is fully excised.\nRemove the laser-punched fragment of the graft (i.e., “flap”), which is attached to the vacuum channel of the catheter, and leave the catheter fixated in the graft and the connector (Figure 5B).\nNonocclusive Connection of Graft to Recipient\n\t\nOpen the lower fork of the connector with the VasCo applicator (Figure 4B) and insert into the lumen of the perfused coronary artery, directed distally (Figure 5C). Make sure the full length of the fork is positioned intraluminally. Subsequently, release the applicator.\nLaser-punched Arteriotomy",
    "Initiate vacuum suction onto the coronary wall and subsequently laser-punch the coronary wall under full native coronary flow, resulting in an orifice of 0.8 by 2.0 mm. Do not apply force onto the catheter during the construction.\nRemove the fixation clip with the Aneurysm clip applier and subsequently retract the catheter. Check if the laser-punched flap is attached to the vacuum channel of the catheter and cease the vacuum suction (Figure 5D).\nFollowing the flap retrieval, occlude the distal end of the graft by a temporary clip (e.g., bulldog clip). If a functional bypass is confirmed (i.e., successful flap retrieval and adequate bypass flow), permanently ligate the distal end of the graft using a hemoclip (Figure 5E).\nIn case of a flap retrieval failure (i.e., an incompletely lasered flap is still partly attached to the coronary wall), retract the connector, close the partially lasered coronary artery with sutures (8-0 prolene), and create a new anastomosis, starting at step 1.1.2.\n2. Animals, Anesthesia, and Euthanasia\nAnimals and Anesthesia\n\t\nUse female (e.g., Dutch Landrace) pigs (70-90 kilogram [kg]) and feed a normal diet.\nAdminister 320 milligram (mg) of acetylsalicylic acid and 75 mg clopidogrel orally daily, starting 3 days before surgery. Continue this anticoagulation protocol until termination.\nAdminister fentanyl 25 microgram (µg) transdermally for 3 days: 25 µg 24 hr preoperatively and 25 µg at day 1 postoperatively for post-surgical analgesia.\nFor anesthesia induction administer ketamine (10 mg/kg), midazolam (0.5 mg/kg), and atropine (0.04 mg/kg) intramuscularly.\nSubsequently, administer thiopental sodium (4 mg/kg), midazolam (0.5 mg/kg), sufentanil citrate (6 µg/kg), and 1,000/100 mg amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (antibiotic prophylaxis) through an intravenous line.\nIntubate and ventilate with a mixture of oxygen and air (1:1 volume/volume).\nUse an eye salve and subsequently close the eyes to prevent dehydration of the eyes.",
    "Then administer as a continuous intravenous infusion midazolam (0.7 mg/kg/hr), sufentanil citrate (6 µg/kg/hr), pancuronium bromide (0.1 mg/kg/hr), and saline solution (300 ml/hr). Start with 300 mg amiodaron in 500 ml hydroxyethyl starch solution through the intravenous line.\nInsert an arterial line in the femoral artery for intra-arterial blood pressure monitoring and arterial blood samples.\n\t\tNOTE: No surgery will be started before this pressure line is functional. One can detect pain, in case the animal is not sufficiently anaesthetized, by an increase of heart rate and blood pressure. If an increase of heart rate and blood pressure is detected, increase the administration of midazolam and sufentanil citrate.\nAdminister metoprolol intravenously (range 5-20 mg) to reduce the mechanical irritability of the heart until a heart rate of approximately 50-70 beats/min is obtained.\nCatheterize the bladder via the urethra during the procedure.\nRecovery\n\t\nStop the anesthesia if the drains (see steps 3.9-3.11) are removed.\nIf the animal is alert and regained sufficient consciousness to breath adequately after extubation, return the animal to the cage (i.e., animal housing area). Do not leave the animal unattended before this point.\nPlace a 0.5 liter (L) oxygen mask in front of the snout by using a safe and secure setup.\nDo not return an animal that has undergone a surgical treatment to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nPostoperatively, administer synolux (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid; 250 mg/20 kg) orally twice a day at day 1 as an antibiotic prophylaxis, and meloxicam (0.4 mg/kg) intramuscularly daily at day 1 and 2 for post-surgical analgesia.\nEuthanasia\n\t\nFully heparinize by 25,000 I.U. of heparin (obtain an activated clotting time [ACT] of at least 4 times the control value) to prevent post-mortem coagulation.",
    "Euthanize the animals with pentobarbital sodium (200 mg/kg) intravenously and confirm death before starting with the postmortem examinations - part 6 of this protocol.\n3. Surgery\nNOTE: A standard operating room is required for the procedure, containing all standard material and equipment (at least a blood pressure monitor, an electrocardiography device, and a pulse oximeter). A standard thoracotomy set, an internal thoracic artery (ITA) retractor, a microsurgical set and the experiment-specific instruments must be prepared and sterilized. The use of a surgical loop and a surgical headlight is recommended.\nOpen the thorax through a sternotomy. Bluntly dissect (with your finger) the pericardium of the sternum. Then saw or split (with a hammer and graver) the sternum from the xyphoid process up to the manubrium. Use bonewax to prevent leakage from the sternal marrow.\nHarvest the left (or right) ITA from the second rib up to the diaphragm, partially heparinize (ACT at least 2.5 times the control value), and clip and dissect the ITA at the distal site.\nImmobilize and present the target coronary artery by a tissue stabilizer at the intended site (outer diameter [OD] 1.6-1.9 mm, measured with a caliper; or, ID 1.4-1.6 mm, measured with epicardial ultrasound [ECUS]). Dissect the target coronary, remove the loose peri-adventitial tissue, and cover the target coronary with a papaverine-soaked gauze.\nPrepare the permanent ligation of the native coronary artery ± 2.0-3.0 cm proximally to the anastomosis (see section 3.7) by extensive lateral dissection of the coronary artery, in such a way a hemoclip can completely ligate the coronary artery.\nDissect the target area of the ITA, ± 2.0-3.0 cm proximally to the distal free end, remove the peri-adventitial tissue, and measure the caliber (OD 2.0-4.0 mm).",
    "Construct the anastomosis with the Trinity Clip as previously described, or alternatively, construct a hand-sutured anastomosis and use a shunt to minimize myocardial ischemia.\nLigate the coronary artery proximally with 3 medium hemoclips. Make sure no side branches are occluded and the ligation is 100% occlusive, preventing competitive flow.\n\tNOTE: Adjust and set the graft flow by placing temporary atraumatic ligation clips at the coronary artery, while maintaining a representative mean arterial blood pressure and physiological position of the heart; to create a low-flow bypass, ligate the coronary sufficiently distally, and to allow more graft flow, ligate the coronary relatively more proximal10.\nCover the anastomosis with a pericardial patch to prevent uncontrolled traction onto the anastomosis, after closing the thorax.\nPlace a mediastinal and/or a pleural drain and connect to a suction system.\nClose the chest.\nOnce the drains stop producing, remove the drains.\n4. Intraoperative Examination\nGeneral Intraoperative Data\n\t\nRecord the target dimensions of the ITA and coronary artery with a caliper (OD) or ECUS (ID; see section 3.3), the anastomotic construction time (minutes or seconds), any anastomotic leakage (categorize: e.g., direct hemostasis, oozing, or brisk leakage5,6), and note if extra stitches are needed to obtain hemostasis.\nTransit Time Flow Measurement (TTFM)\n\t\nRecord the mean flow, flow curves, diastolic filling percentage, and the pulsatility index (PI), combined with the mean arterial pressure.\n\t\tNOTE: Modern TTFM consoles calculate these variables automatically.\nPlace the transit time flow probe on a skeletonized segment of the distal graft with aqueous gel to improve probe contact. Use different probe sizes to avoid distortion or compression of the graft.\nMeasure by an adequate systemic blood pressure, before and after releasing the tissue stabilizer, with the heart in its physiological position, and again before chest closure.",
    "Calculate the PI by (max flow-min flow) / mean flow. The PI is an indicator of the quality of the anastomosis11,12.\nOptional: Peak Hyperemic Flow Response\n\t\nAt a mean arterial pressure of 90 mm Hg, clamp the graft for 30 sec and subsequently measure the peak hyperemic flow response, ± 30 min after release of the tissue stabilizer6.\nCalculate the coronary peak hyperemic flow response (i.e., anastomotic flow reserve) by the mean peak graft flow divided by the mean baseline flow at 90 mmHg.\nDuplicate the measurement after 10 min.\nOptional: Epicardial Ultrasound\n\t\nPlace the ECUS probe onto the anastomosis with aqueous gel to improve probe contact. Acquire a transverse and longitudinal image of the ITA-LAD anastomosis with the heart stabilized by the tissue stabilizer.\nRecord the width, length, and height of the anastomosis with the ECUS system and assess the quality of the geometry of the anastomosis and the coronary outflow tract13. If narrowed (e.g., by back- or sidewall capture), revise the anastomosis.\n\t\tNOTE: Metal (e.g., a hemoclip or an anastomotic connector) influences the imaging quality.\nOptional: Intraoperative Coronary Angiography\n\t\nVisualize the bypass by a standard coronary angiography. Introduce a catheter through the iliac artery. Grade the patency according to the FitzGibbon criteria.\n5. Follow-up Examination\nCoronary Angiography\n\t\nVisualize the bypass by a standard coronary angiography and grade the patency according to the FitzGibbon criteria.\nOptional: Transit Time Flow Measurement\n\t\nMake a subaxillary incision in the dorsal-ventrally line, following the rib curvature. If needed, partially remove the second or third rib, and dissect the proximal ITA.\nMeasure and record the graft flow by transit time flow measurement (see section 4.2).\nOptional: Fractional Flow Reserve and Coronary Flow Reserve\n\t\nAdminister intracoronary nitroglycerin (200 µg) to prevent spasms.",
    "Measure simultaneously the intracoronary pressure and flow velocity. Record the pressure and flow, combined with aortic pressure and ECG signals.\nCalculate the fractional flow reserve (FFR) from (3 consecutive) measurements directly distal (coronary) and proximal (LITA) to the anastomosis, and in the circumflex coronary artery (Cx; control coronary artery). Perform the measurements at baseline and during maximal hyperemia, induced by a bolus of intracoronary adenosine (60 µg).\nCalculate the coronary flow reserve (CFR) as the ratio of maximal hyperemic flow velocity by the flow velocity at baseline14.\nOptional: Optical Coherence Tomography\n\t\nUse a frequency domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) system for imaging the bypass with an automated pullback-speed of 20 mm/sec and a continuous flush of contrast by manual injection.\nRecord intimal hyperplasia and the dimension of the bypass (i.e., the reference lumen area of the coronary and ITA 1.0 cm down- and upstream to the anastomosis, respectively, and the anastomotic orifice)7,15.\n6. Postmortem Examinations\nExplantation, Fixation, and Macroscopic Inspection\n\t\nTo minimize the risk of damaging the bypass, explant the heart en bloc, including the sternum and ribs, and mark the very proximal part of the ITA for formalin infusion.\n\t\tNOTE: A few days after an open thorax procedure, the heart is completely attached to the sternum by connective tissue adhesions. Performing a sternotomy may damage the bypass, and, therefore, is not recommended.\nPerform a perfused-fixation to fix the bypass in its physiological shape, allowing for subsequent proper histological interpretation. Infuse the ITA with formalin (4%) in a flow cabinet at ± 90 mm Hg:\nPlace a bottle with formalin (1 L) ± 1 meter higher than the heart.\nConnect a tube (e.g., a silicon tube of a standard infusion system or similar) between the bottle and the proximal ITA.",
    "Infuse the formalin into the heart, via the ITA and the anastomosis, for about 60 min or until all formalin is completely infused.\nThen, carefully excise the bypass with a blade, scissors, and forceps. Leave some fibrin/scar tissue, myocardium, proximal ITA and coronary, and distal coronary, attached to the anastomosis.\nFixate the anastomosis, a reference part of the ITA (± 1 cm upstream of the anastomosis), and a reference part of the LAD (± 1 cm downstream of the anastomosis), overnight in 4% formalin.\nOpen the coronary artery longitudinally at the inferior wall and inspect the anastomosis using 10 or 20 times magnification. Record the width and length of the anastomotic orifice by perpendicularly photographing the orifice with a ruler next to it. Subsequently, measure the width and length of the anastomosis digitally.\nHistological Analysis\n\t\nEmbed the anastomosis and the reference parts in plastic (methyl methacrylate).\nSection in transverse (or longitudinal) planes with a diamond saw, starting at 5 mm downstream, continuing up to 5 mm upstream of the anastomosis, and stain with hematoxylin and eosin.\nRecord and assess the vessel wall apposition, anastomotic area, thrombus formation, intimal hyperplasia, blood-exposed nonintimal surface16 (BENIS; intraluminal exposure of the connector surface and the laser edge [i.e., medial and adventitial surface of both the graft and the coronary artery]), acute and chronic inflammatory cell reaction (polymorphonuclear cells, macrophages, and foreign body giant cells), and tissue damage6.\nPerform measurements using a software package.\nOptional: Scanning Electron Microscopy\n\t\nFixate the anastomosis, after the perfused-fixation described above (see section 6.1.2), in 2% glutaraldehyde solution buffered in 0.1 M purified phosphate buffer.\nPut the anastomosis 1 hr in 1% buffered osmium tetroxide to complete the fixation.",
    "After fixation, dehydrate the anastomosis in a graded series (50, 70, 90, and 100%) of ethanol and in liquid CO2 by using the critical point method.\nSubsequently, open the backwall of the coronary and the upper wall of the ITA at the anastomotic site with a sharp surgical blade.\nFixate the specimen on scan tubs and cover with a thin layer of platinum by sputter processing to enhance the image quality.\nThen evaluate the intravascular anastomotic surface (i.e., assessment of endothelial and/or thrombocyte coverage) using a scanning electron microscope6."
