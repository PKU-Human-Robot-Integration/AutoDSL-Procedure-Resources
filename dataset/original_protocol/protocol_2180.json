    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPre-imaging preparations\nTo generate reproducible results, especially in vivo live transport assay in C. elegans, the pre-imaging preparations are as critical as subsequent steps, including microscopy imaging and post-imaging analysis. For example, the age of the worm affects the frequency of kinesin and dynein-driven IFT motility along cilia in C. elegans (Zhang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). Furthermore, because unfavorable environmental conditions, including starvation and contamination (mold, fungi, etc.) may impact the health of C. elegans, they likely influence a variety of cellular processes, especially IFT. Consistent with this logic, starvation increases the speed of anterograde IFT (from the base of cilia to the tip of cilia) in C. elegans (Kimura et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). We recommend having contamination-free, well-fed, and synchronized young worms (1 and 2 days old) for the microscopy analysis. For reproducible results, cultivating healthy C. elegans in a sterile Petri dish with contamination-free NGM (Nematode Growth Media) spread with OP50 strain at well-controlled temperatures (20°C) is critical.\nPreparation of next steps for in vivo live microscopy analysis\nTiming: 1 day\nCulture worms for at least one generation without starving and any contaminations at 20°C.\nThe day before microscopy analysis, transfer 100 L4s (fourth-stage larvae, the last stage of larvae before becoming adults) into a new plate, and the microscopy analysis can be done on a 1-day adult.\nPrepare 3% of agarose in a 250 mL bottle and keep it at 65°C in the water bath.\nCritical: We do not advise allowing agarose to re-solidify since it necessitates re-melting with the microwave, which changes the percentage of agarose in each microwave heating.",
    "Note: We do not recommend using the freshly prepared 3% of agarose on the day of preparation, wait for 1 day, because when making an agarose pad in the subsequent days, agarose pads become less brittle, giving better agarose pads. You can use the 3% of agarose up to 7 days.\nFor immobilization of the worms for in vivo live microscopy analysis, 10 mM is working concentration for levamisole, and prepare 10 mM levamisole (an anesthetizing reagent) for 100 μL from a 500 mM stock solution by diluting in M9 buffer.\nCritical: There are several anesthetics that can be utilized, including sodium azide, levamisole, tricaine, and 1-Phenoxy-2-propanol. Because of its effect on ATP, sodium azide has an effect on IFT motility and is not recommended for the IFT motility experiment.\nCritical: Imaging living C. elegans is always challenging and requires a lot of effort as C. elegans tend to display movements during live imaging. Levamisole alone will not effectively immobilize the worms, and in our experience, there will be zero movements in 5 of the 25 videos collected for in vivo live microscopy analysis when only anesthetic levamisole was used, thus increasing the overall effort of microscopy analysis. A microfluidic device or polystyrene beads, or a higher concentration of agar pads are alternative ways of immobilizing worms (Kim et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Clark et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). They can be used in conjunction with levamisole.\nPreparations for the time of image acquisition\nTiming: 4–5 h",
    "Before beginning image acquisition, ensure that the imaging room’s temperature is steady (21°C–22°C) and not fluctuating. Check worms on the day of microscopy imaging to make sure that worms are healthy. We employ a variety of parameters to check the health of worms: 1) They are moving in the plate. 2) There is no bacterial or fungal contamination in the plate. 3) We also make sure they have adequate food on their plate.\nBegin by turning on the computer and fluorescent microscope (in our example, a Leica DM6 B upright fluorescence microscope), then the camera (Andor iXon Ultra 897 EMCCD Camera), and last the controlling software (Andor iQ 3.6.2 Software). It is worth noting that inverted scope can also be employed here. Find fluorescence signal on the slide with a 20× objective lens, then apply a small amount of immersion oil before rotating a 100× objective lens onto the slide to begin taking a live time-lapse movie (HCX PL APO 100×, 1.40 oil microscope objective).\nCritical: To execute the software and subsequent image analysis, a high-performance computer system is required. However, image processing should be performed on a separate computer so that the computer connected to the microscope is not occupied. A high-quality microscope is necessary, but without high-quality cameras and suitable software, it is not possible to acquire high-quality time-lapse recordings for further analysis. Before purchasing a microscopy complete system for live time-lapse movie analysis, we recommend trying the microscope, camera, and software together.",
    "A running protocol must first be set up to take a live time-lapse movie. We therefore spent time finding a suitable exposure time and the gain setting on a fluorescence microscope for an IFT component (IFT-74::GFP; human IFT74) in C. elegans. We set the exposure time to 300.0 ms and the gain to 7. We next set up a running protocol of 333.0 ms per second (3 frames per second (s)) with a total of 100 frames on the Andor iQ 3.6.2 Software.\nCritical: The longer camera exposure time produces a sharper image with higher pixel intensity while also photobleaching i.e., the reduction of the sample's fluorescence signal during image capture. The sample will be exposed to light 3 times per second because the protocol is designed to take 3 images per second, resulting in a decrease in the fluorescent signal. A live time-lapse movie, on the other hand, necessitates a particular amount of time, during which light is gathered from the chosen object. The main issue is that the beginning part of the time-lapse movie may have brighter pictures, but the brightness of the images decreases in the later part of the time-lapse movie, which may damage the overall quality of the time-lapse movie. For better quality of time-lapse movies, we recommend reducing the length of the time-lapse movie with a longer exposure time.\nCritical: Because of the nature of endogenously tagged fluorescent proteins, their expression levels might vary and some may be inadequate to be detected by the microscope. Playing with the exposure time and gain will not assist any more until the fluorescent expression is detectable by the microscope system. Make sure to start with a strain containing fluorescent-tagged protein that is well expressed.",
    "Use Pasteur pipette to take a little amount of 3% (0.3 mL) agarose (stored at 65°C in the water bath). Drop the agarose liquid onto the 18 mm × 18 mm area of the microscope slide, then place the second slide over the agarose to create a smooth and thin layer. Gently press and wait 1 min for the agarose to solidify. Slowly separate slides from each other without disrupting the agarose pad (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]: Slide preparation, related to steps 1–4).\nCritical: Agarose pads must be freshly made at the time of image capturing, and once prepared, they must be utilized within 1 minute.\nAdd 2 μL of 10 mM levamisole over the agarose pad under a stereomicroscope (ZEISS Stemi 508), and then transfer 10–15 1-day adult worms using a platinum wire pick onto agar pads. Put cover slide above the worms and gently press. After mounting, we immediately transfer the slide to the fluorescent compound scope for subsequent microscopy analysis (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]: Worm transformation, related to steps 5–9).\nCritical: Do not harm the worm during transferring; for example, the worm's skin may be injured as a result of the pick's tip, resulting in subsequent bursting while transferring, hence it may affect the result of the IFT assay.\nPlace the slide under the microscope, dab a drop of immersion oil on the cover slide, and look for a worm tail to film. Focus on the GFP signal in the cilia of two phasmid sensory neurons (PHA and PHB) in the tail of worms and start running the protocol that was already set up (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]: Focusing fluorescent signal, related to steps 12 and 13).",
    "Critical: When considering the movement of worm parts and the presence of ciliated cells, recording a worm from the tail is less problematic than filming a worm from the head.\nCritical: Putting mouse pointer over the cilia or a part of the cilia can help to understand movement during the recording.\nCritical: We recommend finishing the time-lapse movie within 30 minutes after mounting the slide. In our experience, we notice that after some time, the speed of IFT particles slows down, which might result in inconsistent results.\nSave all time-lapse series of images in TIFF format taken from the image list section to distinct files for later use with kymograph, speed, and frequency analysis.\nCritical: Discard the time-lapse series of images where worms move. Alternatively, the ImageJ plugin for drift correction can be used to help correct movements in time-lapse movies. The following plugin can be downloaded for manual drift correction: https://imagej.net/plugins/manual-drift-correction#:∼:text=Manual%20Drift%20Correction%20plugin%20allows,by%20interpolating%20between%20key%20landmarks[href=https://imagej.net/plugins/manual-drift-correction#:%7E:text=Manual%20Drift%20Correction%20plugin%20allows,by%20interpolating%20between%20key%20landmarks].\nCritical: The image file size for each time-lapse TIFF file of 100 frames is 200.0 megabytes (MB). Make sure you have enough storage for all microscope analyses, and that you keep the original files. The main challenge, however, is the long-term storage of each time-lapse image. The external hard drives are easy to fail. Cloud storage is another option for long-term data storage, although it needs ongoing subscriptions.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Preparations for image acquisition, related to steps 1–13\nPost-imaging analyses\nTiming: 1–3 h\nFor generating Kymographs and speed analysis, we use two software: ImageJ, a freely available image analysis software, and KymographDirect and KymographClear, automated packages for kymograph analysis, from https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/[href=https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/] and https://sites.google.com/site/kymographanalysis[href=https://sites.google.com/site/kymographanalysis], respectively (Mangeol et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Schindelin et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Download and install both of them.",
    "Once KymographDirect and KymographClear related files are downloaded from the website mentioned above, copy and paste the “KymographClear 2.0a.ijm”, “KymographDirect2.1.aliases”, and “KymographDirect2.1.ini” to the “toolsets” file in the “macro” file in the ImageJ file. Open ImageJ and, install “KymographClear 2.0a.ijm” using the install button on Plugins. Additional buttons will appear on ImageJ which allow users to run KymographDirect, and KymographClear on ImageJ. The user must install the kymograph generation-related plugins to the ImageJ panel each time opens.\nNote: KymographDirect and KymographClear website provides step-by-step instructions about how to install and use these tools: https://sites.google.com/site/kymographanalysis[href=https://sites.google.com/site/kymographanalysis].\nCopy and paste your TIFF files into their dedicated new files created for each TIFF at a particular location on your computer.\nCritical: Dedicated files for each time-lapse TIFF will help avoid confusion. Kymographs are created automatically from each TIFF file during TIFF file analysis; thus, no kymographs will be mixed up when they have their dedicated files.\nDetermining the frequency of anterograde and retrograde IFT\nTiming: 1–2 days\nOpen a single TIFF file with the Kymograph Open Sequence plugin (KymographClear plugin) (yellow file figure in the panel) previously installed on ImageJ. Choose the first of two options: “open a sequence and compute average image” or “open a sequence and compute max intensity image”. After you upload the TIFF file, the “Sequence options” tab will appear. In the “Sequence options” tab, type 1 in the section of “number of images”, then click OK. The time-lapse image will appear and zoom on cilia (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]: Opening files with ImageJ, related to steps 1 and 2).\nNote: Fiji is an ImageJ2-based image analysis software option, however, subsequent analysis needs kymographs created using KymographDirect and KymographClear, both of which are incompatible with Fiji.",
    "Critical: ImageJ and Fiji have alternative kymograph generation plugins, but they require manual drawing of lines in order to produce the kymograph. With manual drawing, two lab members separately did an internal study using the same movies and determined IFT speeds, and their findings were slightly different. The discrepancy was most likely caused by differences in kymograph drawing lines (the slope of line drawings differed). Furthermore, we compared manual kymograph analysis findings to those obtained by KymographDirect and KymographClear using the same videos and discovered that the average IFT speed of manual kymograph analysis was slower than that of KymographDirect and KymographClear.\nMethods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]: Time-lapse microscopy images of yeast cells, related to step 1.\nUsing ImageJ’s panel, draw a segmented line above the cilia from the base to the end (entire cilia). The line delineates the area where the kymograph will be built and measurements (IFT speed and frequency) will be taken (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]: Determining cilia parts, related to step 3).\nNext, in the KymographDirect toolbar, select “Kymograph generation action tool” and set the line width to 5 to produce kymographs for anterograde and retrograde motilities. Kymographs (Anterograde, retrograde, and merged) and speed-related files are automatically saved in the same folder as the TIFF file (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]: Kymograph generation, related to step 4).",
    "Launch the KymographDirect tool and upload kymograph from the file. In the KymographDirect tool, the subpanel is located on the left panel, and the kymograph is in the middle. Anterograde particles appear on a kymograph when the “forward” option is selected, whereas retrograde particles appear when the “backward” option is selected. The quantity of anterograde and retrograde particles may be observed in the subpanel’s “Select a line” option (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]: Counting particles, related to step 6). After noting the number of anterograde and retrograde particles in the time-lapse videos examined, you can proceed to the next time-lapse movies.\nCritical: Intensity threshold and brightness & contrast settings help to reduce background noise during the counting process if you want to check lines as manually. Playing with the threshold on the subpanel will change the number of particles.\nCreate an excel file to save all particle numbers with the experiment name and directions for further analysis (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]: Counting particles, related to step 6).\nTo calculate the average frequency of anterograde or retrograde transport events for each strain, use at least 10 kymograph findings.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Post-imaging analyses, related to steps 1–11\nDetermining the average speed of anterograde and retrograde IFT\nTiming: 1–2 days",
    "In C. elegans, ciliary cargos and signaling molecules are distributed across cilia by kinesin and dynein driven IFT complex. Anterograde IFT, mediated by the kinesin motor, refers to transport happenings from the ciliary base to the ciliary tip, whereas retrograde IFT, mediated by cytoplasmic dynein, refers to transport events that occur from the ciliary tip back to the ciliary base. C. elegans channel cilia have a middle segment (∼4 μm long, microtubule doublets) and a distal segment (∼2.5 μm long, microtubule singlets). In the middle segment of channel cilia, Kinesin II and OSM-3 (human KIF17) motors move at a slower rate (the mean velocity of 0.7 μm/s) carrying IFT components, IFT cargos, and signaling molecules, and all of these cargos are handed over to OSM-3, which travels at a quicker rate (the mean velocity of 1.2 μm/s). The retrograde transport is achieved by cytoplasmic dynein at a velocity of 1.10 μm/s. In the following protocol, we will go over kymograph-based IFT speed measurements using the KymographDirect tool.\nTo measure the average speed of the anterograde IFT in the middle segment, draw a segmented line above the cilia from the base to the middle segment (4 μm), and repeat the step 25 (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B). In a brief, use the KymographDirect toolbar to generate kymograph for anterograde and retrograde transport events. System automatically calculates the average anterograde IFT and retrograde IFT speeds.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1790-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. IFT velocity for anterograde and retrograde directions for IFT-74::GFP",
    "(A) The wild type phasmid sensory cilia (PHA and PHB cilia) are shown with GFP tagged endogenous IFT-74. IFT-74 (green) stains the whole cilium, including the basal body (BB), middle segment (MS), and distal segment (DS). A white arrow indicates the tip of the cilia. The red and yellow arrows represent the locations where the MS and DS kymographs were created, respectively. Scale Bar: 1 μm.\n(B) The kymographs for the middle and distal segments are created with the ImageJ software’s KymographClear2.0 plugin. The red and green lines on the merged kymographs for each kymographs depict particles traveling anterograde and retrograde directions, respectively. Separate anterograde and retrograde kymographs (grayscale) are exhibited under combined kymographs with representative drawing panels of particles. The yellow and red arrow marks on the combined kymographs reflect the kymograph’s orientation for MS and DS, respectively. The x-axis denotes distance (m), while the y-axis denotes time (30 s). Scale bar for distance and time is shown on the merged kymographs.\n(C) The average anterograde and retrograde velocities of IFT-74::GFP in the middle and distal segments are displayed. The number of particles (n) and worms (N) examined is shown in the table. SD stands for standard deviation.\nUsers should hit “Save” on the upper save button on the KymographDirect tool to save files to an existing file called “Results.”. The file named “velocity vs. time” files will be used to calculate average anterograde IFT velocities in the middle segment, and we have supplied a walkthrough video to help you calculate average IFT speeds (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]: Speed, related to step 7).",
    "To determine the average velocity of the anterograde IFT in the distal segment, draw a 2.5 μm segmented line from the ciliary tip and repeat the step 16 and rest of the steps mentioned above (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B). This procedure may be repeated to calculate the average IFT frequency for retrograde, with kymographs obtained to calculate the average IFT frequency.\nNext, open the “Results” file and choose the “velocity vs. time” text file. Copy-paste all results from this text file to an excel file to find all results for further analysis (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]: Saving velocity results, related to steps 8 and 9).\nAverage all velocity and time results for the whole lines in the excel file, separately (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]: Average speed calculation, related to steps 10 and 11).\nAdd more analysis until achieving at least 100 particles for each strain. Then, calculate the average velocity in the overall experiments. We always undertake two independent analyses and then increase the number of IFT particles whenever we observe statistically significant differences in IFT rates between the wild type and mutant strains examined.\nOptional: A more visually appealing display of merged kymograph images would aid readers in estimating the number of moving particles. KymographClear2.0 generates a merged kymograph in the kymograph file called color-coded direction. This kymograph has anterograde and retrograde directions on a static blue backdrop. To create a visually appealing kymograph during the post-imaging process split the color-coded kymograph using the \"Color\" option from ImageJ's Image subpanel, and close the blue TIFF file while keeping red and green TIFF files. Arrange the green and red fluorescent signals using brightness/contrast parameters, then merge them using the \"Color\" option, \"Merge Channels.\" The newly generated kymograph is more aesthetically evident than the color-coded kymograph (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).",
