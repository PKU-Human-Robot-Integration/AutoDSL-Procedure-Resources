    "All animal studies were approved and conducted in accordance with the Johns Hopkins University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Athymic nude female mice (age: 10 weeks) were obtained from commercial sources (see Table of Materials). All Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) regulations were followed, including the usage of masks, gloves, and gowns.\n1. Tumor implantations and bioluminescence imaging\nDuring the initial phase of the study, perform intracranial tumor implantation, following a previously published report6.\n\tNOTE: In this study, 100,000 M59 human GBM xenograft cells in 4 µL of cell suspension were used for implantation at a 3.0 mm depth into the skull.\nPrior to treatment, quantify the tumor size in each mouse noninvasively using an in vivo luminescence imaging system (see Table of Materials) following a previously published report7.\n\tNOTE: This was done on the date of treatment, 7 days following initial tumor implantations.\nUsing imaging quantification, divide the mice into comparable subgroups for treatment.\n\t​NOTE: In this study, two subgroups were included: (1) untreated tumor-bearing mice (n = 4) and (2) tumor-bearing mice undergoing SDT (n = 4). No statistically significant difference in pre-treatment tumor size was observed between the two groups (p > 0.05).\n2. Treatment day setup\nRemove 5-ALA hydrochloride (see Table of Materials) from the freezer and weigh out 200 mg/kg mouse weight of 5-ALA (e.g., for a 25 g mouse, weigh out 5 mg.). Do so under ambient light only.\n\tNOTE: Sterile all the equipment before use. \nDissolve the total amount of 5-ALA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), such that each animal is administered a 60 mg/mL solution of 5-ALA with the correct weight dosage (e.g., for a 25 g mouse, dissolve 5 mg of 5-ALA into 83.33 µL of PBS).",
    "For each animal in the SDT testing group, inject the proper amount of solution of 5-ALA into the animal intraperitoneally (calculated in steps 2.1 and 2.2).\nLeave the animals in their cages for 3 h to metabolize the 5-ALA.\n3. Preparation of requisites for experiments\nFill a reservoir with deionized (DI) water.\n\tNOTE: The amount of water needed is based on the number of mice used in the study.\nAttach the Flow in and Flow out tubes to the ultrasonic degasser (see Table of Materials) and plug in the degasser to the power (1 = ON, 0 = OFF).\nPlace the other end of the Flow in and Flow out tubes into the DI water reservoir.\nTurn on the degasser and run for 45 min.\nFill the newly degassed water to the top of an airtight, sealed container to be used during the study.\nPour ultrasound gel (see Table of Materials) into a conical tube, and then place into a centrifuge and spin at 160 x g for 5 min to remove any air from the gel.\n\t​NOTE: Enough gel is needed to form a dollop of gel on the head of each animal.\n4. MRgFUS system setup\nConnect the MRgFUS system (see Table of Materials) using the wiring diagram as seen in Figure 1 (bottom panel).\n\t\nConnect all necessary components (desktop computer, monitor, MRgFUS platform, oscilloscope, amplifier) to power.\nConnect all cables to the correct locations.\nConnect the desired transducer to the MRgFUS platform via the BNC and coaxial cables, and then connect the corresponding impedance matching box to the correct wires.\n\t\tNOTE: A 515 kHz transducer was used for the present study.\nTurn on all devices.\nOn the desktop computer operating system, open the AUREUS application, which is already integrated into the FUS system software.",
    "Select Connect All Hardware to connect the hardware to the system and make sure that the components are communicating with the software.\nSelect the transducer used by selecting the drop-down menu and choosing the desired transducer.\n5. Initialization\nUnscrew the bottom screw from the phantom and fill the cavity with deionized and degassed water until it overflows, and then replace the screw again.\nInsert the phantom in its corresponding MRI bed location (see Figure 2), and then place the MRI bed into the MRI cradle in its corresponding slot.\nPlace the MRI cradle in its corresponding location in the MRI scanner (see Table of Materials). Adjust the cradle so that the phantom MRI bed can slide into the MRI bore without any obstructions to obtain a high-quality image of the phantom. Mark this location so that it is easily replicable in the future.\n\tNOTE: Once this location is found, the location will not be changed for the remainder of the treatment. Therefore, make sure that it is an adequate location for animal MRI placement, or the entire registration will need to be repeated.\nTake an MRI scan of the phantom using the settings in Table 1.\nRemove the cradle from the magnet bore but keep it on the scanner. Remove the MRI bed containing the phantom from the cradle, and then place the bed with the phantom onto the MRgFUS system by sliding the peg on the bottom into its correct slot.\nSlot the registration tip onto the magnetic slots on the transducer arm so that it points downward toward the phantom (see Figure 2).",
    "On the software, choose Select a New Home Position, and then select Jog Mode On to begin guided focused finding. After jog mode is toggled, use the left, right, up, down, page up, and page down keys to manually move the transducer arm around in the left, right, forward, backward, up, and down directions, respectively.\nAdjust the pointer manually in all three dimensions until the tip of the pointer touches the middle of the cross pattern that lies on the top of the phantom (see Figure 2).\nDownload the phantom MRI images to the computer and place them in a folder in the chosen directory, and then load the MRI images into the software by selecting Load Phantom Images. The axial phantom slices will then populate the screen on the right side. Scroll through these slices via the mouse scroll bar. Adjust the brightness by clicking and holding on the image and then moving the mouse up or down.\n\tNOTE: If any of the files in the folder are not uncompressed DICOM files, then the software will not be able to read and import them, so remove any other files from that folder.\nScroll to any image of the phantom where there is a clear circle with three dark holes in each. Click on the middle of the phantom, and a red circle will pop up. Click and drag on the circle until it is the same diameter and lines up with the circumference of the phantom (see Figure 2).\nThe coordinates of this position are referred to as 'home position'; save this by clicking Set L/R, A/P, and S/I.\nClick Jog Mode Off, remove the registration tip from the transducer arm, and then select Exit Focus Finding. Confirm the home position to complete the initialization sequence.",
    "6. Animal preparation for SDT\nAnesthetize the mouse using an isoflurane-O2 gas mixture in an induction chamber. Set the gas flow rate to 1.0 mL/min and the vaporizer to 2.0% for anesthesia induction, typically requiring 3-5 min in the chamber (see Table of Materials).\nAssess the animal for adequate sedation by pinching the toe. Apply an ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to avoid dryness of the corneas.\n\tNOTE: Monitor the anesthesia depth throughout the procedure.\nInject the mouse with 40 µL of gadolinium contrast agent through the tail vein (see Table of Materials).\nRemove any hair obstructing the scalp above the skull using a hair removal cream and an electronic shaver.\nSecure the animal to the MRI bed using the following steps (see Figure 3).\n\t\nConnect the inlet tube of the MRI bed (Figure 3A) to a source of isoflurane for anesthesia, and set the gas flow rate to 1.0 mL/min and the vaporizer to 2.0% for anesthesia induction. Connect the outlet tube to a charcoal filter canister for anesthesia absorption.\nPlace the nose cone piece into its slot, as shown in Figure 3B. Slide the bite bar through the bite bar holes in both the nose cone and at the end of the bed, as shown, with the bite guard end hovering over the open well in the MRI bed.\nPlace the animal on the MRI bed with its ears lined up with the stereotactic ear bar holes and latch its teeth through the bite guard to keep it in place. Slide the nose cone forward so that it is over top of the animal's snout to provide a steady stream of anesthesia.",
    "Slide the ear bars through the holes on both sides of the MRI bed and raise the animal's head until both ear bars can fit into the mouse's ear canals.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not push too far, as this can damage the animal's ear drums.\nEnsure that the animal is in a comfortable position. Then, using a flathead screwdriver, screw in the MRI-compatible screws to lock in both ear bars, the nose cone, and the bite bar. This will lock the animal into place and prevent any head movement until the animal is removed from the bed.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure that there is no disturbance to the animal's positioning on the MRI bed following this step. If the animal moves, then the entire setup (step 6.5) will need to be repeated, regardless of how far along the protocol is.\nWhile the animal is waiting, place the MRI bed on a warm heat pad to maintain the body temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Monitor and maintain the body temperature throughout the procedure.\nIsoflurane is continuously supplied to the animal via tubes attached to the nose cones throughout the treatment when the animal bed is fixed on the FUS system, using the fixtures provided on the platform.\n7. MRI procedures\nTake the MRI bed with the animal stereotactically fixed and place it in the MRI cradle previously connected to the MRI scanner (see Table of Materials), by slotting the MRI bed hole at its end to the peg on the MRI cradle, as shown in Figure 3. Attach the inlet and outlet anesthesia tubes to the corresponding tubes in the MRI machine.\nSlide the MRI cradle containing the animal into the MRI bore, making sure to keep the same positioning as where the phantom was placed.",
    "Perform a localizer to see the location of the animal brain and then a post-contrast T1-weighted MRI scan covering the entire brain using the MRI settings from Table 2.\nExport the MRI scan as a set of uncompressed DICOM files, one for each slice.\n8. Focused ultrasound treatment (Figure 4)\nRemove the animal from the MRI cradle after completion of the scan and place it on the platform by slotting the front of the bed into its corresponding peg at the back of the platform, and slotting the back of the bed into its corresponding peg.\nConnect the inlet tube of the MRI bed to a source of isoflurane for anesthesia and set the gas flow rate to 1.0 mL/min and the vaporizer to 2.0% for maintenance of anesthesia. Connect the outlet tube to a charcoal filter canister for anesthesia absorption.\nTransfer the set of DICOM files to the computer and place them in a folder in the main working directory of the current study.\n\tNOTE: Refer to step 5.9 for file requirements.\nIn the software, go to the main initialization page and turn on Jog Mode by clicking on Guided Focus Finding and then click on Jog Mode On.\nPlace a dab of centrifuged ultrasound gel on the animal's head, with enough gel to cover the entire scalp above the skull.\nPour DI and degassed water into the water bath up to 80%, and then slot the water bath onto its corresponding columns on the platform.",
    "Lower the water bath filled with DI water until the bottom membrane touches the ultrasound gel on the animal's head, forming a coupling surface between the water and the gel. Make sure that the ultrasound gel covers the entire head of the animal to the water bath and that there are no air bubbles in the ultrasound gel between the water bath and the mouse's scalp.\nSubmerge the ultrasound transducer into the water bath, ensuring no air bubbles are forming on the transducer surface.\nLower the transducer arm using Jog Mode Down toward the partly submerged transducer, and couple it to the transducer by aligning the magnetic slots with each other while the transducer surface remains submerged.\nTurn off Jog Mode, and then Exit Focused Finding, as done during the initialization step. Make sure to confirm the home position as done before.\nGo to the treatment tab, and then upload the post-contrast T1-weighted MRI files by clicking the folder icon in the top middle of the screen. Select the folder containing the DICOM files that were uploaded to the computer previously and open them. This step should automatically load all DICOM files in the top right panel.\nNext, in the Sonication Mode tab, select the proper treatment mode by choosing either Burst or Continuous Wave. If on burst mode, in the Sonication Settings tab, enter the burst length, burst period, and number of periods. These parameters will correspond to each sonication location. If in continuous wave mode, only enter the sonication duration.\n\tNOTE: In this study, continuous wave mode was used for a 120 s duration.",
    "Click on the target icon in the top middle of the page and select the proper locations on the correct MRI slice where the FUS focal region is to be aimed. A light red square with a red circle will be present where clicked. More than one selection can be chosen.\nLeft of the MRI image is a table, which will populate with the 3D coordinates of the focal regions selected. In the last column of the table, enter the power level to be sonicated at each focal spot, which can be calculated separately for each transducer used to obtain the desired pressure or intensity levels. Click on each focal spot in the table to confirm, which will result in the coordinates being highlighted, and the corresponding focal region on the image will turn blue.\n\tNOTE: Refer to the transducer datasheet to determine how to translate the power level entered into the table into pressure or intensity, as these values are transducer specific.\nOnce satisfied with all focal regions, select Motion Test. This will prompt the software to move the transducer to all of the focal spots to ensure the movements are possible. After confirmation, the software will indicate Motion Test Complete. If an error occurs, adjust the focal regions so that they can fit within the 3D axes of the transducer motors.\nOnce ready, select Begin Sonication to begin the sonication protocol, moving the transducer and applying the correct FUS parameters at each focal region selected.\nOnce the sonication protocol is finished, uncouple the transducer from the transducer arm, remove the water bath from the platform, and wipe off the ultrasound gel from the animal's scalp.",
    "Unscrew the bite and ear bars, remove the animal from the MRI bed, and then place the animal on a warm pad until the animal wakes up from anesthesia. At this point, return the animal to its cage.\nFor subsequent animals, repeat the same protocol, starting from section 6.\nOnce the desired animals are treated, clean all surfaces touched by animals with 70% ethanol (see Table of Materials).\nQuit out of the software, and then shut down and turn off each piece of equipment.\n9. Post-treatment steps\nRepeat the in vivo imaging system (IVIS) protocol from section 1 for bioluminescence measuring 24 h post-treatment. To analyze treatment effectiveness, compare the bioluminescence recordings before and after treatment to determine the growth rate for both treated and untreated groups.\nPerform follow-up MRI scans using the same settings from step 6.4. Using contrast-enhanced scans, compare the mean greyscale intensity of the tumor region or calculate the total volume that is covered by the contrast agent to determine differences in tumor volume pre- and post-treatment."
