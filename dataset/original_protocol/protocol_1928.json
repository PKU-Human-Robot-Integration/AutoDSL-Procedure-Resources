Although this combination guarantees the Inovitro LiveTM setup to fit in the microscope chamber, other microscope chambers with a minimum chamber height of 30 mm may be used.\nUsing Inovitro LiveTM software\nTiming: 5 min\nIn the following steps, all options and functions in the InoVitro LiveTM software (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) are explained.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1524-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "A view of the software that is used to control the Inovitro LiveTM setup, depicting the main screen (A); panel to change parameter settings (B); ongoing experiment screen displaying all dish parameters (C); graphs of log files over time (D).\nCreate a new experiment by pressing the ‘New Experiment’ button (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nIn the pop-up window, the experiment name, owner, and a short description can be filled in.\nUse only regular characters (letters and numbers) for experiment name and owner\nDisable the “configure session” option.\nSet the desired parameters correctly (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nThe frequency of TTFields can be applied between 50 to 500 kHz.\nE.g., U251 is treated with 200 kHz.\nMedium target temperature can be set between 20°C to 40°C.\nCover heating element temperature can be set between 37°C to 55°C.\nDuty cycle A and B represent the frequency of switching between TTFields directions. Set either A or B to ‘0’ to apply TTFields from a single pair of electrodes.\nAdjust alarm thresholds by pressing the ‘Change Default’ button.\nIf the medium temperature exceeds the set value, an alarm will be displayed.\nWhile the experiment is running (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C), the following values will be displayed:\nFrequency\nTarget temperature\nTemperature (2×)\nCover Temperature\nCurrent (2×)\nResistance (2×)\nVout\nDuring an experiment, log graphs (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D) can be requested by pressing the ‘reports’ button.\nStart & end TTF treatment\nTiming: Dependent on experimental setup\nSet the treatment settings using the Inovitro LiveTM software and start the experiment.\nDepending on the cooling strategy:\nStage top incubator: Set the temperature of the stage top incubator to the desired value, ranging from 18°C-32°C, with lower temperatures leading to higher TTFields intensities.",
    "Cooling coil: Start the peristaltic pump at the lowest speed and allow the medium temperature to stabilize. Gradually increase the pump speed until desired current is reached.\nTo prevent disruption of flow of the peristaltic pump:\nCheck if the silicone tubing is firmly placed in the pump.\nCheck if no connections between the silicone tubing are leaking.\nMake sure the cold water inflow tubing is not blocked.\nMeanwhile, position the dish with cells at the region-of-interest and select the desired microscope settings (channels, exposure times etc.) using the microscope software.\nFollow the experiment for 20–30 min until the medium temperature has stabilized and, if necessary, adjust the focus of the microscope as temperature changes can affect focusing.\nTo end the experiment, press the stop experiment button in the software (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nAllow time for all data to be transferred from the generator to the laptop/computer.\nTurn off the generator and disconnect all cables from the insert.\nRemove the Inovitro liveTM insert from the dish by pulling vertically.\nRinse the insert thoroughly with distilled water and let dry.\nSterilize the insert in an autoclave before the next experiment.\nOptional: When using a stage top incubator in experiments that last longer than 24 h, the medium has to be replaced daily.\nConnect a sterile 5 mL syringe to the silicone tubing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nPause the experiment by clicking the pause button in the software (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nRemove the medium using the syringe.\nCarefully inject 3 mL new medium with a new, sterile syringe.\nNote: The cover heating element can become warm. To avoid skin burns, only touch it after sufficient cooling time (>1 min.) after turning off the system.",
    "Note: The slightest movement of the dish could impede cell tracking during long experiments. Make sure you are not putting any tension on the dish, cables, or silicone tubing."
