    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThawing hESCs\nTiming: 30 min\nPrepare a Matrigel-coated 6-well plate (refer to Aliquoting and Plating Matrigel), and keep the hESC culture medium ready, which has been warmed to 22°C–25°C.\nRemove the cryopreserved hESC vial from the liquid nitrogen storage tank, transfer to the 37°C water bath to thaw quickly.\nWhen most the contents are thawed, slowly transfer it to 15-mL tube, and then add 5 mL of hESC culture medium in a drop wise manner. Gently shake the tube to mix the cells. Centrifuge at 200 × g for 5 min at 22°C–25°C.\nCarefully aspirate and discard the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL hESC culture medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632.\nCompletely aspirate Matrigel from one well of precoated 6-well plate, add the cell suspension into the well immediately, Place the plate into 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator, gently shake to evenly distribute the cells.\nNote: ROCK Inhibitor Y-27632 can markedly diminish dissociation-induced apoptosis of hESCs, enhance colony formation of dissociated hESCs after passaging.\nCritical: Do not break apart the colonies too much by excess pipetting. See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E for optimal aggregate size.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/573-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative photographs of hESCs grown on matrigel\n(A and B) Bright field images show cultured hESCs with undifferentiated state at 10× (A) and 4× (B) magnifications. The boxed region is magnified in the right. (A) Representative image shows an example of 60%–80% confluency of hESCs.\n(C) Representative image shows the morphology change of differentiated cell clones. The boxed region is magnified at the bottom.\n(D) hESC colony morphology after incubating with EDTA in a few minutes.\n(E) Optimal size of hESC aggregates during passaging with EDTA.\nFeeding and passaging hESCs\nTiming: 60 min",
    "The next day after thawing hESCs, prewarm DPBS and hESC culture medium to 20°C–25°C, remove the spent medium with debris, wash the cells once with 1 mL prewarmed DPBS, and then add 2 mL fresh and prewarmed hESC culture medium without Y-27632 for continue feeding. Refresh culture medium daily until cells require passaging.\nCritical: Cell morphology is monitored under the inverted microscope. Healthy undifferentiated hESCs display round colony morphology with high cell density and clear boundary (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B), while the differentiated cells exhibit changed morphology (e.g., enlarged cells and cell-cell spacing, fibroblast-like morphology) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Scrape off large differentiated colonies with a P1000 pipette tip by visual recognition. Small differentiated colonies will spontaneously disappear upon passaging.\nProceed to passage when the hESC colonies are becoming too large or reaching 60%–80% confluent (approx. 3–5 days).\nNote: For optimal results, cells should be approximately 60%–80% confluent after 3–5 days in culture (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). If cells do not reach this confluency, adjust the timing to start the differentiation later.\nPrewarm hESC culture medium, DPBS and EDTA Dissociation Buffer to 20°C–25°C. Prepare a Matrigel-coated 6-well plate (refer to Aliquoting and Plating Matrigel), aspirate the Matrigel from the well, and then add 2 mL of hESC culture medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 per well.\nAspirate the spent medium from the hESCs to be passaged. Rinse the cells with 2 mL DPBS and EDTA solution sequentially, and then add 1 mL the EDTA solution to each well.\nIncubate for 2–5 min at 22°C–25°C within the hood. Remove the EDTA solution carefully without disturbing the attached cell layer. Use 2 mL of hESC culture medium with 10 μM Y-27632 to wash the colonies off the plate and dissociate cells by gently pipetting up and down three times.",
    "Critical: The longer the hESCs incubated in the EDTA solution, the smaller the colonies that will result. Keep the movement of the plate to a minimum to avoid lifting the colonies completely off the plate during incubation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: Do not break apart the colonies too much, avoid excessive pipetting as hESCs are very sensitive (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nTransfer the desired cell amount per well (the splitting ratio is about 1:6–1:10) into the readied Matrigel-coated plates.\nShake the plates back and forth and side to side to distribute the cells, leave it in the incubator for 12 h to allow maximum cell attachment.\nOn the next day, remove the culture medium from cells, rinse the cells with 1 mL prewarmed DPBS, and then add 2 mL of prewarmed hESC culture medium (without Y-27632) to each well in the 6-well plate.\nOn each following day, repeat step 13 to change culture medium, and monitor cells daily.\nNote: Long time culture (exceeding 48 h) in Y-27632 conditioned culture medium will cause significant irreversible changes in cell morphology, thus it may affect the cell state of hESCs. The conditioned medium should be replaced by hESC culture medium (without Y-27632) the next day after thawing or passaging.\nCritical: Passages of stem cell always have impacts on the subsequent applications, we recommend using hESCs between passages 30 and 60. For subsequent applications, it is recommended to use hESCs that have been passaged at least twice after thawing to ensure the cells have returned to normal status.\nGeneration of biallelic RB1-mutated (RB1Mut/Mut) hESC lines using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing\nTiming: 8–12 weeks",
    "When hESC colonies are reaching 60%–80% confluent (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B), aspirate culture medium, rinse the cells with 1 mL prewarmed DPBS and TrypLE Select solution (refer to hESC dissociation solution) sequentially, and then incubate with another 1 mL TrypLE Select solution for 3–5 min at 37°C.\nOptional: Pretreatment with 10 μM Y-27632 in hESC culture medium for 2 h before single-cell plating can effectively enhance the survival rate of hESCs (Liu et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nAlternatives: Other commercial reagents (i.e., ACCUTASE) for single cell dissociation can be used as a substitute.\nUsing P1000 pipette tip, gently pipette up and down the TrypLE Select solution in the well three times to make a single-cell suspension.\nCritical: Avoid excessive pipetting as hESCs are very sensitive. Monitor dissociation under a bright-field microscope to ensure that cells are dissociated into single cells. If some cell lines appear to be more difficult to dissociate, the dissociation time can be extended to 10 min.\nTransfer the single-cell suspension to a 15-mL centrifuge tube containing 5 mL of hESC culture medium.\nCell density is counted using a Handheld Automated Cell Counter (Millipore). Meanwhile, centrifuge the cell suspension at 200 × g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant, and approximately 2 × 106 cells are re-suspended with nucleofector solution prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol by mixing 82 μL P3 primary cell solution and 18 μL supplement 1 (Lonza), mixed with 5 μg of plasmid cocktail, including 2.5 μg of guide-carrying plasmids and 2.5 μg of RB1 targeting vector, and transferred into a nucleofection cuvette (Lonza).\nCells in the nucleofection cuvette are electroporated under the program CA-137 using Nucleofector 4D (Lonza).\nNote: Avoid trapping bubbles when transferring, as it may impact the efficiency of electroporation.",
    "Alternatives: Other programs or Nucleofector equipment for hESCs electroporation can be optimized or tested to achieve the best transfection efficiency.\nFollowing nucleofection, gently transfer the cells into Matrigel-coated plates containing hESC culture medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632, and cultured in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\n48 h after electroporation, treat cells with 2 μg/mL puromycin (Gene Operation) for about 7 days. After puromycin selection, the surviving clones will appear and should be ready for picking, expanding and for further genotyping.\nFor picking clones, prepare a Matrigel-coated 24-well plate (refer to Aliquoting and Plating Matrigel). After coating, replace Matrigel with 0.5 mL of hESC culture medium supplemented with 10 μM Y-27632 per well.\nFind cell colonies under the microscope. By using a smaller-gauge needle, cross-hatch the colony so that it will come off the plate in smaller pieces (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Use a P1000 pipette tip to push the colony off the plate and suck it into a pipette tip. Transfer the colony pieces into one well of the 24-well plate.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/573-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Generation and identify of Biallelic RB1-mutated (RB1Mut/Mut) hESC lines\n(A) Bright field image shows the survived single-clones after resistance selection can be picked by mechanically cross-hatch the colony.\n(B) The location of the primers used to identify the recombination.\nNote: Pick the colonies under a normal inverted microscope. The microscope can be placed inside a Class II biological hood to allow for a sterile field while picking colonies.\nRepeat steps 23 and 24 with other colonies. Place the plate into 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator, and gently shake to evenly distribute the cells.\nNext, the colonies are expanded as described in steps 6–14.\nIdentification of introduced mutations in positive RB1Mut/Mut clones (named as RB1Mut/Mut hESCs).",
    "Extract genomic DNA from individual colonies using DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit according to manufacturer's instructions.\nDetect the HR (Homologous recombination) and non-HR allele by PCR using the following primers (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B): Primer1F (5′-GTGCTAGTGGGAGAGGCTGACAAAG-3′) / Primer1R (5′-GCCAATGCTACAAAACAGTACCTAA-3′), Primer2F (5′-CACGCCTGTAATTCTAGTACTTTGG-3′) / Primer2R (5′- GAAACGTGAACAAATCTGAAACACT -3′) or Primer3F (5′- TGGGATGTTTGGAAAATCTTGGCAGT -3′) / Primer2R,\nExamine the PCR fragments by Sanger sequencing.\nIdentify potential mutations of RB1 gene by comparing the colony sequence with WT sequence.\nRoutinely maintenance of RB1Mut/Mut hESCs is same with WT hESCs, as described in steps 1–14.\nOptional: Ideally, resistance gene (puro) in RB1-mutated hESCs can be further removed using the Cre/LoxP system.\nAlternatives: Here, we describe the generation of human Rb organoids from biallelic RB1-mutated (RB1Mut/Mut) hESCs. hESCs with a biallelic RB1 knockout (RB1−/−) (Avior et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) can also be used to establish the human Rb organoids, as described in our publication (Liu et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nCritical: Only biallelic RB1-mutated or knockout hESCs with the loss of RB protein function can be used effectively to generate Rb organoids.\nCharacterization of RB1Mut/Mut hESC lines\nTiming: 5–7 days\nWith the knockin of nonsense mutation p.R320X, the generated RB1Mut/Mut hESC lines should absent the expression of RB protein (pRB), and sustain the primordial state without changing pluripotency and genetic integrity.\nPerform western blotting with anti-Rb antibody at 1:1,000 dilutions to analyze the expression of RB protein (pRB) in RB1Mut/Mut clones.\nFlow cytometry analysis for pluripotency marker genes (i.e., Oct3/4 or Sox2) in RB1Mut/Mut clones.\nUse prewarmed TrypLE Select solution to carefully dissociate the clones into single-cell suspension as described in steps 15–18.\nRepeat PBS washes twice and resuspend cells in media.\nStain the cells with Alexa Fluor 488/647-conjugated antibodies (1:50) in PEB (PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA) buffer for 30 min at 4°C.",
    "The cells are filtered through 100 μm nylon mesh and then analyzed for fluorescence by FACSCanto II (BD Biosciences).\nKaryotype analysis of RB1Mut/Mut clones.\nAspirate the culture medium, and add 1 mL of DPBS to wash out the remnants of the medium.\nAspirate the DPBS, and treat the cells with 0.1 μg/mL colcemid at 37°C for 2 h.\nUse prewarmed TrypLE Select solution to carefully dissociate the clones into single-cell suspension as described in steps 15–18.\nResuspend and incubate the cells in 0.075 M potassium chloride for 15 min at 37°C.\nFix the cells with 3:1 methanol:acetic acid, and then drop onto slides to spread the chromosomes.\nThe chromosomes can be visualized by Giemsa (Servicebio) staining.\nSingle-cell seeding, embryoid body (EB) formation, and neuroepithelium induction\nTiming: 18 days\nOn day 0, check the cell confluency, 60%–80% is the best for starting the differentiation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Use prewarmed TrypLE Select solution to carefully dissociate RB1Mut/Mut hESCs into single-cell suspension as described in steps 15–18.\nCount cell density, and plate at a density of 12,000 live cells per well in 96-well low-attachment V-bottom plates with 100 μL differentiation medium I supplemented with 20 μM Y-27632.\nNote: The plating density affects cell viability and differentiation efficiency. We recommend using the cell density at 12,000 live cells/well. Approximately 144×104 cells needed per 96-well low-attachment V-bottom plate, and re-suspended with 12 mL differentiation medium I supplemented with 20 μM Y-27632. Plate 100 μL cell suspension into each well of a 96-well low-attachment V-bottom plate.\nCritical: 96-well low-attachment V-bottom plates are needed for rapid cell reaggregation (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Y-27632 can also significantly increase cell reaggregation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/573-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Single-cell seeding, EB formation, and neuroepithelium induction\n(A) 96-well low-attachment V-bottom plates used for rapid cell reaggregation.",
    "(B) Aggregates can be visible with the naked eye from day 6. When transfer the organoids from each well into a 15-mL tube at day 18, the organoids should gather at the bottom of the tube after few minutes of standing.\n(C) Stepwise induction strategy of Rb organoids. Timed hBMP4 treatment is critical for differentiation induction.\n(D) Representative images of the healthy and unhealthy EBs at differentiation day 12.\nPut the plates on a spiral mixer device, and shake for 10 min at 60–80 rpm to allow cells to gather at the bottom of the well.\nPlace the plates into 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator.\nOn day 6, take out the plate and slightly tilt it, use an 8-channel P100 pipette to carefully aspirate the medium from each well, leaving EB-like aggregates at the bottom of wells. Aggregates in each well can be visible with the naked eye (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nQuickly add 100 μL fresh differentiation medium I containing 55 ng/mL hBMP4 to each well to re-suspend the aggregates, and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 3 days.\nOn day 9, carefully remove 50 μL medium from each well, change equal volume of fresh differentiation medium I (without hBMP4) back to each well for 3 additional days (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nOn day 12/day 15, perform routine half medium change as described in step 38.\nNote: Optimal EBs should have a round and smooth morphology, the anterior neuroepithelium develops on the outer surface and is quite optically translucent (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). Suboptimal EBs usually exhibit uneven surface with dead or unhealthy cells attached, fails to form neuroepithelium, and will eventually form cystic organoids (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).",
    "Critical: Timed hBMP4 treatment is critical for differentiation induction. A volume of 55 ng/mL human BMP4 is added to the culture on day 6, and its concentration is semi-reduced with a half medium change every 3 days (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nEarly stage of retinal differentiation\nTiming: 6 weeks\nOn day 18, take out the plate and gently tap from both sides to make the aggregates (organoids) free-floating. Organoids can be visible with the naked eye (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Using a wide-mouth P1000 pipette tip (simply cut the tip with scissors), transfer the organoids from each well into a 15-mL conical tube.\nCritical: To avoid the damage of aggregates, use wide-mouth pipette tips to transfer aggregates. Gentle operation is also required for the transfer process.\nLet the organoids to settle at the bottom of the tube (approx. 1–2 min) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B) and carefully remove the supernatant from the top.\nAdd 5 mL differentiation medium II to wash the organoids, let the organoids settle to the bottom again and then remove excess differentiation medium II.\nCarefully resuspend the organoids with 10 mL differentiation medium II and transfer into a low attachment 9-cm Petri dish using a 10-mL pipette.\nManually trisect the organoids using a V-Lance Knife (Alcon Surgical) under the inverted microscope in a Class II biological hood (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Add 10 mL of additional differentiation medium II to the Petri dish.\nCritical: Turn off the light of the hood to avoid isomerization of retinoic acid in differentiation medium II.\nGently shake the dish and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 /40% O2 for continue induction.\nRefresh the differentiation medium II every 7 days (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nFor media refreshing, rotate the dish to gather the organoids in the center.\nCarefully aspirating the medium from the surrounding using vacuum aspiration system.",

Manually trisect the organoids using a V-Lance Knife under the inverted microscope in a Class II biological hood, step 44\nGently swirl the Petri dish every day to avoid the organoids adhere to the bottom.\nOn day 20, take out the dish, remove the badly differentiated organoids using a 10-mL pipette, and separate the fused organoids using a V-Lance Knife under the inverted microscope. Place the dish into incubator for further culture.\nNote: The state and morphology of organoids can monitor in real time using an inverted microscope (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B). Organoids in poor condition tend to adhere to the bottom of Petri dish (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A), pipette the adhered organoids with the medium to resuspend it, or remove it using a 10-mL pipette.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2.

Arrows indicate excessive outgrowth of Rb cells, subsequently leading to detachment from the organoids. Scale bar, 400 μm.\n(E) A typical morphology of NR and tumor-like “primary foci” structures in hRBOs can be observed after thawing.\nAlternatives: When organoids are culture in suspension in a Petri dish, half medium can be changed every 5 days.\nOn day 30, repeat step 48 to remove the badly differentiated organoids, separate the fused organoids under the inverted microscope (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nUsing a 10-mL pipette, gently distribute the organoids into multiple dishes, with no more than 30 organoids in each dish. Return the dishes to 37°C, 5% CO2 /40% O2 incubator, change the medium every 7 days as described in step 46.\nCritical: Do not put too many organoids in a single plate, which is not conducive to long-term culture.\nNote: There was no observable difference between Rb and retinal organoids before differentiation day 45 (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B).\nTumorigenesis and long-term culture of human Rb organoids\nTiming: 5 weeks\nOn day 60, tumor-like “primary foci”, with the obvious uneven density inside and ill-defined edge, are visible in a minority of retinal organoids (named as human Rb organoids) under the microscope (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). It will expand rapidly from the masses thereafter (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B and 5C).\nPerform media change routinely every 5–7 days as described in step 46.\nOn day 75, obvious tumor-like “primary foci” structures can be seen in most organoids (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nUsing a 10-mL pipette, gently distribute the organoids into multiple dishes, with no more than 15 organoids in each dish, refreshing the medium every 5 days as described in step 46.",
    "Critical: The tumor structures are relatively loose and easy to detach from the organoids. Be careful when changing the medium or collecting samples to avoid damage of Rb organoids (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nAfter day 90, the tumor-like “primary foci” structures will wrap around the entire mass (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B), and excessively proliferating Rb cells can migrate into the medium in suspension conditions (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nGently trisect the larger organoids using a V-Lance Knife under the inverted microscope for long-term culture.\nNote: Avoid organoids from growing too large, which will cause nutrient deficiency in the cells inside the organoids.\nCharacterization and tumor growth monitoring of human Rb organoids\nTiming: 5–7 days\nFor the characterization of human Rb Organoids, they can be cryopreserved, sectioned, and immunocytochemically stained for the expression of proliferative or Rb marker, such as Ki67, SYK, DEK and p16INK4a.\nAfter day 75, select the organoids with obvious tumor-like “primary foci”, slightly transfer into a 2-mL using a 10-mL pipette.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant, wash the organoids three times with 1 mL DPBS, then add 0.5 mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution to fix them at 37°C for 1 h. Wash the organoids three times with PBS.\nStain the organoids with Ponceau S solution at 37°C for 5 min, and then wash them with NEG-50 Frozen Section Medium.\nCarefully embed the organoids into a disposable embedding mold containing NEG-50 Frozen Section Medium.\nQuickly place the molds into −80°C refrigerator for 20–30 min to freeze the organoids, and then cryosection at a thickness of 12–16 μm on slides using a cryostat.\nPause Point: Once fixed and embedded, organoids can be stored at −80°C for more than 12 months. After cryosection, the sections can subject to immunocytochemistry or storage at −80°C for up to 12 months",
    "For immunocytochemistry, wash the sections three times for 10 min with PBS, block and permeabilize the sections in 4% BSA with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 22°C–25°C.\nDilute the primary antibody in PBS with 1% BSA with 0.5% Triton X-100.\nAspirate the spent blocking buffer of the sections, and incubate with appropriate dilutions (1:100–1:400) of primary antibody at 4°C for 12 h.\nNote: Different primary antibodies may require specific immunostaining conditions, please refer to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nDilute the secondary antibody (1:400) in PBS with 1% BSA with 0.5% Triton X-100.\nAspirate the primary antibody dilution, wash three times for 10 min with PBS, add 100–200 μL secondary antibody dilution, and incubate for 1 h in the dark at 22°C–25°C.\nAspirate the secondary antibody dilution and wash once with PBS. Add 300 nM DAPI nuclear stain solution and incubate for 5-10 min in the dark at 22°C–25°C.\nRemove the solution and wash the sections three times with PBS.\nUsing absorbent paper absorb moisture around the sections, add 10 μL antifade mounting medium, and gently cover the cover slips. Seal the edges of the coverslip using transparent nail varnish and dry for 3 min. Store the slides at 4°C in the dark.\nThe stained sections can be visualized using confocal microscopy.\nCryopreservation of human Rb organoids\nTiming: 1.5 h\nOrganoids are typically cryopreserved intact at the relatively early stage (day 30–50) and can be used for further applications after thawing.\nDuring days 30–50, take out the dishes, carefully collect the organoids using a 10-mL pipette and transfer into a 15-mL tube containing 1 mL differentiation medium II.\nPlace the tube on ice for 10 min.\nRemove the supernatant from the top, replace with 1 mL pre-chilled cryopreservation pretreatment solution, and incubate on ice for 10–15 min.",
    "Remove the Pretreatment Solution, add pre-chilled organoid cryopreservation medium to resuspend the organoids.\nTransfer 200 μL of the cryopreservation medium with 15–20 organoids to a labeled 1.5-mL cryovial.\nDirectly frozen the vials in liquid nitrogen for storage.\nCritical: Do not use narrow-mouth pipette tip to collect or transfer the organoids, which will seriously affect the survival efficiency of frozen organoids.\nNote: Human Rb organoids can be cryopreserved for at least one year using this protocol.\nFor organoid thawing, take out the stock vials from liquid nitrogen, add 1 mL prewarmed (20°C–25°C) differentiation medium II to thaw the frozen human Rb organoids quickly.\nRemove the supernatant, and then wash twice with differentiation medium II.\nTransfer the organoids to a new Petri dish using a 10-mL pipette, add 15 mL of differentiation medium II for post-maintenance culture.\nNote: Five days after thawing, neural retina-like structures are clearly visible in the organoids that are alive and in good condition (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E). In our experiences, the survival rate of Rb organoids after thawing is ranges between 60%–80%."
