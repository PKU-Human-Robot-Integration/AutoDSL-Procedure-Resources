    "1. PL, IPL, and OPL samplings\nPL sampling\nBreak the freshly laid unfertilized egg manually and use an egg separator lying on a glass beaker to separate the yolk from the white. Remove the chalazae with small scissors and roll the yolk over a filter paper to remove adherent albumen that appears as a transparent and visible structure (Figure 2A).\n\t\tCAUTION: Be careful not to puncture the PL with scissors. The use of tweezers instead of scissors to remove chalazas may provoke PL breakage and subsequent yolk leakage. The rolling step on the filter paper is critical and should be performed very quickly due to the absorbent properties of the paper filter that may trigger PL breakage. It is also very important to use an unfertilized egg from the day of lay, to optimize the success of this first step and all the subsequent steps. Alternatively, eggs that have been stored less than 10 days in a cooled environment may be used but experimenters must consider potential risks of PL alterations.\nImmerse the yolk in a crystallizer containing 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 that has been previously cooled down to 4 °C and remove the PL area over the germinal disc within a 1 cm zone using blunt scissors (Figure 2B).",
    "NOTE: Initially, PL was immersed in deionized water, but this approach has some disadvantages, such as the lack of pH control and the difficulties to separate sublayers afterwards (step 1.2). Therefore, several conditions were tested including Tris concentration (Figure 3A) and pH (Figure 3B). The use of a buffer at pH 8, instead of deionized or demineralized water, is in accordance with egg physiology (the pH of egg white is about 7.8 on the day of lay)14 and minimizes protein loss. In contrast, acidic or very alkaline pH is suspected to trigger PL de-structuration and early protein solubilization (Figure 3B). The buffer composed of 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 was found to be optimal, as it respects the egg physiology and does not cause significant protein solubilization (protein concentration in the working buffer remains minimal, Figure 3A,B).\nRupture the PL with small scissors in the buffer. Hold the two edges of the ruptured PL with forceps and peel the PL off the yolk.\nMaintain the PL with forceps and rinse the PL several times in several baths of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8 until no trace of yolk is visible. At this stage, ensure that the PL is clean, white, and floating in the buffer. It can be processed in step 1.2 for sublayer separation or directly to step 2.1 for biochemical analyses.\nOPL and IPL sampling\nSpread out the whole PL sample by putting OPL upward into a plastic Petri dish and maintaining it flat with as less wrinkles as possible. Cover the sample with 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 50 mM NaCl. Use a plastic Petri dish (and not glass) to limit PL movements, because PL sticks better to plastic.",
    "To locate the OPL side, look at where the location of the remaining chalazae that are attached to the OPL and not the IPL. This step requires small NaCl concentration (50 mM) to facilitate sublayer separation.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Based on the graph presented in Figure 3C and literature11, this concentration should not lead to major protein loss. Initially, deionized water was used to separate the sublayers, as described previously1,5,6, but this technique was found to be very laborious and resulted in the alteration of the structural PL integrity. Therefore, different NaCl concentrations (Figure 3C) were tested as salt facilitated the separation of the two sublayers. However, it is noteworthy that the use of NaCl concentration >100 mM increases protein solubilization/release from the PL, which is not the objective here (this will be the objective in step 2) (Figure 3C). Adding 50 mM NaCl to the 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8 buffer facilitates separation of the two sublayers and minimizes protein loss.\nCut the total PL into pieces of about 2 cm x 3 cm with small scissors. Mechanically separate the two layers of each PL piece with ultra-precise tip forceps under a binocular dissecting microscope (Figure 4). Store the resulting IPL and OPL samples individually in microtubes at -80 °C, until further use.",
    "NOTE: The protocol can be paused here. It should be noted that the efficiency and the facility of separation of the two layers greatly depends on the freshness of the egg. Indeed, stored eggs show drastic internal modifications due to the rapid increase in egg white pH and subsequent alteration of the yolk index due to the PL loosening (and weakening). IPL is more fragile as compared with OPL. It is, therefore, preferable to place the face of the OPL above and to separate the two sublayers by pulling on OPL with the forceps. Both sublayers should be handled with precious care.\n2. Sample treatment for protein solubilization and SDS-PAGE analyses\nPrimary protein solubilization\nFreeze-dry IPL and OPL samples individually. Once freeze-drying is completed, cut approximatively 1 mg from each sample in clean microtubes possessing a leak proof screw cap. Keep the remaining samples in tightly closed tubes for prolonged storage at -80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The use of microtubes with a leak proof screw cap ensures hermetical and leak-proof closure to prevent sample rehydration and that will secure the samples.\nMix 1 mg of each lyophilized sublayer with 400 µL of 50 mM Tris pH 7, 500 mM NaCl. Use a mixer-mill for 2 times for 5 min at 30 Hz to disintegrate OPL and OPL structures in microparticles and facilitate protein solubilization. Collect 400 µL of the samples containing the OPL and IPL in two clean microtubes.",
    "NOTE: The buffer used here has been chosen to increase protein solubilization (unlike step 1). This buffer was based on the results presented in Figure 3, which show an increase in protein solubilization at pH 7 (Figure 3B) and using 0.5 M NaCl (Figure 3C). The protocol can be paused here. At this stage, samples can be used for the protein purification of main PL proteins or processed to step 2.2.\nProtein solubilization for electrophoresis\nAdd 5x SDS-PAGE sample buffer (100 µL, 0.25 M Tris-HCl, 0.05% bromophenol blue, 50% glycerol, 5% SDS, 5% beta-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8) to each 400 µL of the sample and heat at 100 °C for 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here, and samples can be stored at -80 °C. At this stage of the protocol, OPL and IPL are completely dissolved. The efficiency of the sample solubilization can be assessed by centrifuging samples for 5 min at 10,000 x g. Complete solubilization is characterized by an absence of visible pellet after centrifugation. Thus, after complete solubilization, it is considered here that 1 mg of lyophilized sublayer corresponds to 1 mg of proteins (the protein concentration in the 500 µL sample is 2 mg/mL). Indeed, PL is composed of more than 80% protein2,15. The use of a 5x sample buffer limits sample dilution but a 1x or 2x sample buffer can also be used.\nLoad a maximum of 20 µg of proteins/lane on a SDS polyacrylamide gel (4%–20% gradient gel) and perform electrophoresis at 120 V using a vertical electrophoresis system.",
    "NOTE: The use of a 4%–20% gradient gel is not mandatory but is preferable here as OPL and IPL exhibit proteins with molecular weights ranging from <10 kDa to >250 kDa. It might be also useful to keep the stacking gel (that is usually removed), as the presence of insoluble proteins or protein aggregates at the bottom of wells would indicate poor solubilization and a possible missing step during the sample preparation.\nAfter electrophoresis, remove gels from the glass plates and stain with Coomassie Brilliant Blue solution (50% H2O, 40% EtOH, 10% acetic acid, and R250 Coomassie Brilliant Blue) for 30 min.\nDe-stain with a solution consisting of 50% H2O, 40% EtOH, 10% acetic acid solution until the gel background appears light blue.\nFinally transfer the gel in Petri dishes containing deionized water, to achieve de-staining and rehydration of polyacrylamide gels. Proteins should appear as blue bands of a transparent background."
