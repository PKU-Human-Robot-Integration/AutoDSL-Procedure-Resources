    "Homogenization and extraction of samples Weigh a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube with two grinding beads (3 mm stainless steel metal balls) inside.Sample 20 pea axillary buds (approximately 2 mm each) into one Eppendorf tube and snap freeze in liquid nitrogen.Weigh the Eppendorf tube again after sampling and calculate the weight of axillary buds.Homogenize the frozen plant tissues with 2010 Geno Grinder at 4 °C (1,500 stroke/min, 2×1 min).Two outputs: RNA pellet and supernatant Add 1 mL of freshly prepared extraction solvent (80% acetonitrile containing 1% acetic acid and 5 µL internal standard working solution) to the homogenized sample and vortex for 10 s at room temperature.Leave the extract at -20 °C for 5 min and then centrifuge at 15,900 × g and 4 °C for 10 min.Transfer 950 μL of supernatant to a new Eppendorf tube for hormone extraction. The remaining pellet can be used for RNA extraction (see Note 1).Evaporate supernatant using a rotational vacuum concentrator with cold trap at room temperature until pellet is completely dry.Sample cleaning with solid phase extraction (SPE) column Add 1 mL of 1% acetic acid to the dried sample and pipette up and down three times for redissolution.Store the sample at 4 °C until loading on Sep-Pak tC18 cartridge at step 14.Set up the solid phase extraction manifold with Sep-Pak tC18 cartridge (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4524/bioprotoc-12-19-4524-g001.jpgFigure 1. The setup of solid phase extraction manifold with Sep-Pak tC18 cartridge. Wash Sep-Pak tC18 cartridge with 1 mL of 100% methanol.Activate tC18 cartridge with 1 mL of 1% acetic acid.Load the sample (from step 10) on the activated cartridge.Wash the loaded cartridge with 1 mL of 1% acetic acid.Elute the sample with 1 mL of 80% acetonitrile containing 1% acetic acid.",
    "Evaporate the eluted sample using the rotational vacuum concentrator with cold trap at room temperature until completely dry.Add 50 µL of 1% acetic acid to the dried sample, pipette up and down three times for redissolution, and vortex for 30 s.Centrifuge the dissolved sample at 15,900 × g and 4 °C for 10 min and transfer the supernatant into a HPLC vial.Store the sample at -80 °C before loading on the UPLC–MS/MS.UPLC–MS/MS setup The UPLC–MS/MS system used for this protocol is a Nexera X2 ultra-high pressure liquid chromatograph system coupled with a 5500 triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometry system equipped with an electrospray ionization source (ESI). The UPLC method is as follows:Mobile phase A: 0.5% formic acid in Milli-Q water (v/v).Mobile phase B: 0.5% formic acid in acetonitrile (v/v).Flow rate: 0.5 mL min-1.UPLC gradient: 4% B over 0.5 min, 4%–15% B over 7 min, and 15%–95% B over 3.5 min.Cleanup step: 95%–95% B over 2 min, 95%–4% B over 0.1 min, and column wash for 1 min.ESI parameters (for positive and negative modes, respectively): curtain gas, 20 psi; collision gas, medium; ion source temperature, 500 °C; ion source gas 1 and 2, 80 psi; and IonSpary voltage, +4,500 V or -4,500 V.The scheduled multiple reaction monitoring (sMRM) parameters are listed in Table 2.Table 2. sMRM parameters for phytohormone standards and their corresponding internal standards. CE, DP, and EP are the same between PH and ISTD.  table:",
