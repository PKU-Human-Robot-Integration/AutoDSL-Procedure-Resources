    "The protocol follows the guidelines of the hospital ethics committee. There are 3 steps in the exchange sessions: patient preparation; initial isovolemic phlebotomy (if appropriate); and whole-blood exchange, consisting of several cycles, or continuous whole-blood phlebotomy, which is associated with the infusion of diluted PRBCs. Depending of the Hb level of the patient, a fourth step of intermediary isovolemic phlebotomy can be added midway through the exchange stage. At the start of the session, all of the necessary material (packed RBCs and 5% serum albumin) must be ready. Also, each step must be prepared in advance. Other than a precision scale and double venous access, no specific equipment is required. However, it is imperative to have constant medical supervision over the whole procedure, and even more so if the exchange volume is high.\n1. Patient Installation\nCarry out laboratory tests prior to starting the exchange transfusion session. Perform them on the same day, less than 24 h before the session. Do not perform the tests before a physician checks the results of the following tests.\n\tNOTE: The tests include a complete blood count, reticulocyte count, HbS rate measurement, indirect antiglobulin test (IAT), calcemia and electrolytes measurement, and liver function and coagulation tests, routinely performed by the hospital's hematology and biochemistry units.\nHave the physician perform a thorough and complete physical examination of the patient, and pay specific attention to hemodynamic parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Obtain a recent body weight. Maintain an oxygen saturation >98% throughout the exchange session. To do so, administer patients with 1 L of oxygen via a nasal cannula while in supine position with the feet slightly raised.\n2. Blood Product Preparation",
    "Calculate and obtain the initial phlebotomy volume (see Table 1). For example, if the initial Hb rate of the patient for the session is 10 g/dL, bleed 12 mL/kg of blood in 60 min. For a patient of 30 kg, bleed 360 mL of blood (these are appropriate volumes).\n\tNOTE: An Hb rate of around 8 g/dL prior to the exchange transfusion must be reached because the initial phlebotomy volume is calculated based on the patient's Hb level (Table 1).\n\tNo prior phlebotomy is required if the Hb level is below 8.5 g/dL. The initial phlebotomy must not exceed 5 mL/kg of body weight in the case of patients who have suffered from a recent stroke (within the last 3 months).\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nInitial Hb level (g/dL),10,9.5,9,8.5\nVolume to be bled (mL/kg),12,10.0,8,5.0\nMinimal duration of phlebotomy (min),60,60.0,45,20.0\nTable 1. Calculation of the Volume of the Initial Phlebotomy During Manual Exchange Transfusion. \nThe initial phlebotomy volume is calculated based on the patient's initial Hb level, with the goal of reaching an Hb rate around 8 g/dL prior to the exchange transfusion. The duration of the initial bleeding depends on the volume of the phlebotomy. No prior phlebotomy is required if the Hb level is below 8.5 g/dL. The initial phlebotomy must not exceed 5 mL/kg of body weight in the case of patients who have suffered from a recent stroke.\nCalculate the exchange volume; the total exchange volume is 35 - 45 mL/kg of body weight (e.g., if the patient is a child of 30 kg, the volume of the exchange transfusion will be around 1,200 mL).",
    "NOTE: This volume is both the volume of blood that will bleed during the exchange step and the volume of diluted PRBCs that will be transfused to the patient during the exchange step. The final volume depends on the volume of the exchange transfusion, calculated with the body weight of the patient.\nObtain the appropriate volume of 5% serum albumin solution (from the pharmacy) so that it is ready for use at the beginning of the session. Calculate the required volume: 50 - 100 mL to infuse prior to initiating the phlebotomy, plus the same volume during the initial phlebotomy to compensate for bleeding, plus 1/3 of the exchange volume to dilute the PRBCs.\nObtain the appropriate volume of phenotypically matched PRBCs (i.e., 2/3 of the calculated exchange volume from the blood bank).\nReduce the hematocrit of the PRBCs from 60% to 40% by diluting the PRBCs with 5% serum albumin.\n\tNOTE: The dilution must be performed at the blood bank in a new blood bag. If this is not possible, use a 3-way tap to simultaneously transfuse the PRBCs and the 5% serum albumin and respect the flow proportions of 2/3 for the PRBCs and 1/3 for the albumin solution.\n3. Patient Preparation\nPrepare two peripheral venous lines on two different limbs, one for the phlebotomy and one for the infusion of the albumin solution and PBRCs; the venous line for phlebotomy necessitates sufficient blood flow, and the one for infusion requires standard blood flow. Use a single venous access for infusion and phlebotomy with a 3-way tap if venous access is seriously limited.\nAdminister 1 g of calcium per os to the patient before and after the exchange session; this prevents the occurrence of hypocalcemia due to the presence of a calcium chelating anticoagulant in the transfusion bags.",
    "4. First Step of MET: Isovolemic Phlebotomy, if Appropriate\nStart the infusion of 5% albumin on one venous access. After infusing about 20 - 50 mL of albumin solution, begin phlebotomy on the second venous access.\nTo perform the bleeding, install a peripheral intravenous access connected to an empty bleeding bag in the patient's arm. Place the bag below the level of the patient's bed. Observe the venous blood gradually fill the bleeding bag.\n\t\nIf the blood flow is too low, lift up the patient's bed (or lower the bleeding bag) in order to increase the height difference between the arm and the bleeding bag, thus increasing the blood flow. Optionally, in case of very low blood flow, have the nurse draw blood manually with a 50-mL syringe using a 3-way tap placed on the venous line.\n\t\tNOTE: The flow of the phlebotomy must be the same as the flow of the infusion so as to strictly maintain the isovolemic balance.\nWeigh the bleeding bag on a precision scale during the phlebotomy in order to adapt the infusion flow in real time to compensate for the volume bled.\n\tNOTE: If no scale is available or if there is only a single venous access, bleed 20 mL of blood each time 20 mL of albumin is infused.\nAt the end of the phlebotomy step, check the Hb levels using an Hb point-of-care test according to the manufacturer's instructions and make sure that it is around 8 g/dL.\nMonitor the patients every 5 min during the initial isovolemic phlebotomy step. Stop the phlebotomy if clinical changes relevant to the patient's age are observed.\n5. Second Step of MET: Isovolemic Exchange Transfusion",
    "For safety reasons, start the transfusion of diluted PRBCs first. Transfuse the first 20 mL of blood and then start the phlebotomy. The planned total volume of the phlebotomy at this step is the same as the volume of the transfusion (35 - 45 mL/kg of body weight).\n\tNOTE: The rate of the phlebotomy must be the same as the infusion rate of the diluted PRBCs, following the same method as in the previous step (i.e., weigh on a precision scale or alternate 20 mL cycles).\nMidway through the exchange step, check the Hb levels, as described in step 4.3. If the level is > 9.5 g/dL, perform an additional round of phlebotomy. If not, continue the exchange transfusion.\nMonitor the patients every 15 min during the exchange transfusion step; a nurse must keep a close watch on the occurrence of any clinical and/or hemodynamic changes.\n6. Additional Phlebotomy\nPerform an additional bleeding phlebotomy (see step 4.1) if the Hb levels midway through the exchange step are > 9.5 g/dL, as there is a risk of reaching a too-high level of Hb at the end of the session.\n\tNOTE: The volume of the additional phlebotomy step depends on the Hb level (Table 2).\n\tCompensate with a 5% albumin infusion, as described above, in order to keep the additional phlebotomy isovolemic, just like in the other steps.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nMidway Hb level (g/dL),10.5,10,9.5\nVolume to be bled (mL/kg),8.0,6,3.0\nMinimal duration of phlebotomy (min),30.0,20,15.0\nTable 2. Calculation of the Volume of the Intermediate Phlebotomy During Manual Exchange Transfusion.",
    "Perform an additional phlebotomy if the Hb level midway through the exchange step is higher than 9.5 g/dL, as there is a risk of reaching a too-high level of Hb at the end of the session. The duration of the initial bleeding still depends on the volume of the phlebotomy.\nJust like the initial phlebotomy, monitor the patients every 5 min. Stop the phlebotomy immediately if clinical changes occur.\nAfter the additional phlebotomy, check the Hb levels using an Hb point-of-care test, and then continue the exchange procedure using the same method.\n7. Final Laboratory Test\nAt the end of the exchange transfusion, perform laboratory tests for Hb, HbS, and calcemia. Do not allow the patient to leave before the results of the laboratory tests (or at least the Hb levels) have been checked by a physician.\n\tNOTE: Overall, while the duration of the procedure varies depending on the volume to bleed and to exchange, it lasts around 4 h, on average.\nSubscription Required.
