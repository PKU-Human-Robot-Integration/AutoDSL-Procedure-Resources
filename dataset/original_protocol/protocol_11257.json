    "Collect IRB approved and patient consented fresh human glioblastoma (GBM) tissue from the operating room. Transfer GBM samples on ice in DPBS containing 2x anti-anti to a BL2 certified biological safety cabinet.\nTransfer one 1 cm3 GBM sample with minimal necrosis or red blood cell contamination to a 60 mm plate and cut into 1 mm3 fragments; remove any excess DPBS.\nDigest the tissue with 5 mL of collagenase/dispase (1 mg/mL) for 30 min at 37 °C and gently swirl the dish every 5-10 min.\nTransfer digested fragments to a 50 mL tube and triturate by pipetting with a 10 mL pipette several times to dissociate the tissue.\nAdd an equal volume of Neurosphere Media and triturate the tissue again; allowing the large fragments to settle.\nRemove media without tissue fragments and pass slowly through a 70 µM cell strainer placed over a fresh 50 mL tube.\nRepeat steps 2.1.5-2.1.6 until all the tissue has been dissociated, changing the cell strainer as needed.\nSpin the cell suspension at 110 x g for 10 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of ACK lysing buffer to remove red blood cell contamination. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nSpin the cell suspension at 110 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells in 10 mL of Neurosphere Media. Take 10 µL of the cell suspension and dilute with 10 µL of trypan blue.

Compartmented culture of Rat Dorsal Root Ganglia (DRGs), Oligodendrocytes (OPCs) and hGCs\nPreparation of compartmented culture dishes\n\tNOTE: Perform the following steps the days before the planned harvest of the DRGs.\n\t\nAssemble compartmented culture dishes.\nDilute collagen stock solution to 500 µg/mL in sterile distilled H2O; mix thoroughly.",
    "With a sterile transfer pipette, fill a 35 mm culture dish with 2 mL of collagen solution; remove the solution, leaving a thin film of collagen behind and place it into the next 35 mm dish. Repeat this process, adding more collagen solution as needed, until all dishes have been coated.\nOnce all plates are coated, place the plates in a 245 mm x 245 mm culture tray and lay three 1 mm x 1 mm gauze pads in the center of the tray.\nTo polymerize the collagen, wet gauze pads with 1 mL of concentrated ammonium hydroxide and cover the trays for 15 min.\nRemove gauze pads and allow the 35 mm dishes to dry in the laminar flow hood.\nWhile dishes are drying, load the barrel of the syringe grease applicator with high vacuum grease. Place the compartmented chambers in a large mouth media bottle filled with distilled water. Sterilize both by autoclaving and allow to cool.\nFile off the point of an 18-G needled to make a blunt tip. Sterilize in 70% ethanol. Attach the needle to the grease syringe.\nSterilize the pin rake by soaking in 70% ethanol; allow it to air-dry in the laminar flow hood.\nRemove the lid from a dry, collagen coated 35 mm dish. Hold the dish between the thumb and pointer finger. Hold the pin rake with the other hand. Apply a firm pressure to create even 200 µM wide scratches across the center of the dish.\nUsing a pasture pipette, place two drops of Supplemented Neuronal basal Medium in the center of the scratches.\nRepeat steps 3.1.10-3.1.11 until all dishes have been scratched.\nDry the compartmented chambers in a laminar flow hood.",
    "With sterile hemostatic forceps, grasp one compartmented chamber by the center divider. Flip the hemostatic forceps so the bottom of the chamber is facing up.\nApply silicone grease to the compartmented chamber, starting at the top. Ensure that grease is placed neatly and overlaps at all corners.\nRemove the lid from a 35 mm dish. Invert the dish and place the scratches over the chamber. Tap down on the bottom of the plate gently with a pair of forceps.\nGently flip the plate over by using the hemostatic forceps. Release the forceps.\nPlace a mound of grease at the base of the center compartment. Fill each chamber with Supplemented Neuronal Basal Medium (NB) and check for leaks. Seal leaks with silicone grease as needed.\nContinue assembling all culture dishes and store overnight at 37°, 5% CO2.\nIsolation of Rat DRG Neurons and Culture in the Compartmented Chamber\nSacrifice a timed pregnant E16 Sprague-Dawley rat by CO2 asphyxiation or by chemical overdose.\nPlace the animal in the supine position on a clean surface; disinfect the abdomen with 70% ethanol.\nGrasp the skin of the lower abdomen with forceps and lift gently.\nUsing scissors, make an \"I\" incision along the midline of the animal, taking care not to puncture the muscles of the abdominal wall.\nWith a clean pair of forceps, grasp the muscle wall and make a transverse incision with a clean pair of scissors using caution not to puncture the uterus or intestines.\nWith a pair of blunt forceps, grasp the uterus and gently lift straight up out of the peritoneal cavity.\nUsing fresh, sterile scissors, clip the connective tissue at the base of each uterine horn.\nPlace the entire uterus in a sterile 100 mm tissue culture dish.\nCarry the uterus to a laminar flow hood for dissection.",
    "Remove embryos from the uterus, one at a time, by clipping through the amniotic sac and gently teasing the embryo out and into a 60 mm dish containing 5 mL of L-15 with 1x pen-strep.\nWith fine forceps, place 3-4 embryos into a 60 mm dish containing 5 mL of L-15 with 1x pen-strep.\nWorking under a dissecting microscope and with one embryo at a time, euthanize by decapitation.\nLie the embryo ventral side up and remove the limbs and the tail.\nWith fine forceps, make a midline incision in the animal.\nRemove internal organs and tissue to expose the dorsal structures, particularly the spinal cord which should be visible upon completion.\nPlace one blade of micro-dissecting scissors between the vertebral column and the spinal canal and carefully cut through the vertebral column to expose the spinal cord. Take care not to clip through the spinal cord.\nWith fine forceps, lightly grasp the rostral end of the spinal cord and slowly lift out of the embryo. The DRGs will be attached to the spinal cord.\nTransfer spinal cords and attached DRGs to a 35 mm dish containing 2 ml of L-15 with 1x pen-strep. Place on the ice.\nOnce all spinal cords have been isolated, use fine forceps to individually pluck DRGs from the spinal cord. Place DRGs into a fresh 35 mm dish.\nIf nerve roots are present on DRGs, clip them away.\nRemove prepared 35 mm dishes from the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator. Remove the media from the previous day. Place 80 µL of Supplemented Neuronal Basal Media (NBF) containing 10 µM 5-Fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUDR) in the center compartment and 250 µL of media in each outer compartment.\nPlace 2 ganglia in each center compartment. Return dishes to the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.",
    "The following day add 2.5 mL of NBF.\nFeed the cultures following the schedule in Table 1, altering the schedule based on the day chosen to begin the DRG prep.\nOn day 21 (or when axons reach the end of the distal compartments), either seed cultures with a GBM neurosphere (Proceed to step 3.2.26) and live image or myelinate the cultures with oligodendrocytes cultures (Proceed to step 3.3) and then seed with a GBM neurosphere after myelination.\nReplace Supplemented NB Medium in each distal compartmented chamber that will be seeded with a GBM neurosphere with Supplemented NB Medium containing 10% FBS.\nWith a P20 pipette set to 10 µL, remove one GBM neurosphere from the culture dish. The GBM neurosphere should measure approximately 200 microns in size.\nPlace the tip of the pipette in the distal chamber and expel the GBM neurosphere slowly so that it gently falls onto the axons in the portion of the distal chamber that is closest to the center chamber, over the axons near the center chamber. Be careful not to let the pipette tip disrupt the axons.\nLeave the culture in the biosafety cabinet for 1 h at room temperature to allow the GBM neurosphere to attach.\nOnce the neurosphere has attached, very carefully replace the media in the distal compartment with Supplemented NB Medium.\nLive image cultures for 3-7 days, adding media as needed. In this case, a controlled CO2 live cell enclosure attached to the microscope (e.g., Zeiss Axiovert) was used to continuously monitor cell migration for 7 days using brightfield. Images were acquired every 10 min using the associated software. Repeat the same protocol using hGCs that have been stably transfected to express GFP and images were captured using a combination of brightfield and 488 nm laser.",
    "NOTE: Neurospheres may be transduced with lentivirus or transfected with plasmids or siRNAs. Compartments may also be treated with desired small molecule inhibitors to study migration.\nMyelination of DRG Axons with Oligodendrocytes\nThe day before oligodendrocyte isolation, replace the NB Medium in the DRGs with C-Medium.\nBefore dissection, place 10 mL of Papain Buffer into a 60 mm dish in the incubator to equilibrate.\nIn a laminar flow hood, fill one 100 mm dish and one 60 mm dish with ice cold HBSS. Place on ice.\nSacrifice a P2 rat pup by decapitation. Remove the skin using a pair of scissors.

Using a spatula, gently scoop the brain from the bottom of the skull and transfer to an inverted tissue culture plate lid.\nRemove the cerebellum and divide the cerebrum into two cerebral hemispheres. Remove the olfactory bulbs, hippocampus, and basal ganglia below the cerebral cortex of each hemisphere. Place the cerebral cortex in the 100 mm dish containing HBSS. Repeat steps 3.3.4-3.3.6 for the remaining animals.\nWorking with one cortex at a time, remove the meninges with fine Dumont forceps. Place all meninges-free cortices into fresh 60 mm dishes with HBSS.\nDice the cortical tissue into 1 mm3 pieces. Place on ice.\nPlace equilibrated Papain Buffer into a 15 mL tube. Add 200 units of papain and 2 mg L-cysteine. Filter sterilize and add 200 µL of sterile DNase I.\nRemove HBSS from the diced brain tissue and replace with Papain Buffer from 3.3.2. Place dish in 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 80 min, gently shaking every 15 min.\nTransfer the digested tissue to a 50 mL tube and add 2 mL of C-medium.",
    "Triturate with a 5 mL serological pipette to dissociate the tissue; allow larger pieces of tissue to settle. Remove supernatant and place into a sterile 15 mL tube.\nAdd 2 mL of C-Medium and repeat trituration with a 5 mL serological pipette once more. Switch to a 1 mL pipette tip and triturate until the tissue is completely dissociated. Transfer to the 15 mL tube.\nSpin the triturated tissue at 300 x g for 15 min. Carefully remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 8 mL of DMEM-ITS-G Medium.\nPre-wet a sterile 30 µM cell strainer with 2 mL of PB Buffer. Place cell strainer over a 50 mL tube and filter the cell suspension 1 mL at a time. Rinse the filter with 5 mL of PB Buffer.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 100 mm bacteriological plate; incubate for 15 min in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator to allow microglia to attach.\nRemove media and place into a 15 mL tube. Rinse the plate gently with 2 mL of DMEM-ITS-G medium and transfer to the 15 mL tube.\nResuspend the cell suspension gently. Take 10 µL of the cell suspension and dilute with 10 µl of trypan blue. Count 10 µl of the cell suspension using an automated cell counter or hemocytometer.\nSpin the cell suspension at 300 x g for 10 min.\nAspirate supernatant completely and resuspend cells in 70 µL of PB Buffer for every 1 x 107 cells. Mix well and incubate at 4 °C for 10 min.\nAdd 20 µl of anti-A2B5 microbeads for every 1 x 107 cells. Mix well and incubate at 4 °C.\nAdd 1-2 mL of PB Buffer for every 1 x 107 cells and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min in a 4 °C centrifuge.",
    "Aspirate supernatant completely. Resuspend up to a total of 108 cells in 500 µL of PB Buffer. Keep on ice.\nPlace a magnetic bead column in the magnetic field of a separator.\nPrepare the column by rinsing with 500 µL of PB Buffer. Apply the cell suspension to the column.
