    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation and isolation of FDB fiber\nTiming: 10 days\nIn this step, we describe the steps to induce the overexpression of mCherry-EGFP-LC3 via electroporation in the mouse FDB fiber as well as the isolation of the FDB fiber for further evaluation.\nInject anesthetized mice with 10 μL of 2 mg/mL hyaluronidase dissolved in sterile saline at the ventral side of the hind paws using a 29-gauge needle.\nNote: Hyaluronidase digests components of the extracellular matrix to permit more efficient entry of plasmid into myofibers.\nOne hour later, inject 20 μL (2 mg/mL) mCherry-EGFP-LC3 plasmid DNA in autoclaved ddH2O at the same site of hyaluronidase injection.\nElectroporation of the muscle.\nFifteen minutes later, place two electrodes (0.2 × 13 mm stainless steel acupuncture needles, Millennia, 210906) about 10 mm apart at the starting lines separating paw and toes.\nApply twenty-five pulses of 100 V/cm electric field at 20 ms bursts with 1 s Burst interval under LV mode (ECM 830 Electro Square Porator, BTX, Holliston, MA).\nOn day 8, inject colchicine (0.4 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (IP) into the mice.\nNote: control mice receive an equal volume IP injection of autoclaved ddH2O.\nFDB fiber isolation.\nOn day 10, surgically remove FDB muscles and place in Tyrode solution.\nPlace the FDB muscle inside a tube with 1 mL digestion solution, then incubate for 40 min at 37°C in a shaking incubator.\nAfter collagenase treatment, dissociate the FDB fibers by several passages through a series of pipettes with decreasing diameter.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]\nPlate the Fibers onto glass-bottomed dishes filled with Tyrode solution, and ready for imaging.\nConfocal imaging\nTiming: 1 h\nPlace the glass-bottomed dish with isolated FDB fibers on the dish holder of the microscope.",
    "Note: FDB fibers can be imaged up to 24 h post isolation55, however we suggest that imaging within 2 h after the fiber isolation for best quality.\nConfocal microscope setting and imaging:\nImage the Intact FDB fibers on a Zeiss 780 confocal microscope with 20× objective lens. A standard imaging setting was applied for the imaging. Using 488 nm Laser to excite EGFP and 594 nm Laser to excite mCherry.\nUse 2048∗2048 scanning resolution to capture and save all images as original CZI files.\nNote: Microscopes from different companies may have their own file formats. Most of them can be read into Fiji-ImageJ automatically via an integrated Bio-Formats Importer.\nImage processing and analysis\nTiming: 20 min\nThe method below use a homemade ImageJ macro (FFTmuscle.ijm) to run batch processes on a single input folder of images. The program process and gener processed images and results were output into a new folder within the user-selected directory (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). If using the user’s own image sets, the directory structures may be different, and running the macro might need to be adapted accordingly. Entire images were used for analysis to avoid cherry-picking. The resolution needs to reach at least several pixels per punctum (for a given AP or AL), otherwise it would be difficult to distinguish them from random noise across the image.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2384-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(B) FFT is used to define patterns of basal fluorescence that are of repetitive nature (step 1), which is removed in step 2. In step 3, inverse FFT is used to reconstruct fluorescence image after subtraction of baseline fluorescence in single FDB muscle fiber.\n(C) FFT image analyses of GFP (top) and RFP (bottom) for quantification of APs and ALs. Analysis were performed with processed fluorescence images of GFP or RFP after removal of the striation pattern. Processed images were merged to reveal the overlay pattern of GFP and RFP. GFP represents APs. RFP minus yellow puncta represents ALs.\n(D) The number of green, red, or yellow puncta were quantified (count) and the area of fluorescence aggregates were calculated (total area), from which the average size was defined as total area/count.\nDownload the macro: FFTmuscle.ijm.\nOpen Fiji software.\nDrag the macro file to the Fiji window.\nA new macro window will be opened and all codes inside are available for further editing and optimization, e.g., selection of GREEN or RED channels.\nChange of Macro Parameter:\nCritical: Since the experiments or imaging setting varies from the different muscle fibers, the parameter of the macro might need adjustment according to users’ own experimental settings:\nChannel assignments: Lines 26–33, C1, C2, and C3 represent three split color channels of the image. In this case, C1 is green, C2 is transparent (not used), and C3 is red (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nAuto thresholding methods in lines 51 and 84:\nNote: Maximum entropy thresholding can determine the optimal threshold value for image segmentation taking into consideration the probability distribution of target and background composition without any prior information. Thus, it works well even with a variety of different expression levels of your target proteins (GFP or RFP).",
    "Parameters to analyze EGFP- or mChery-positive particles in lines 66, 99, and 108:\nNote: The size and circularity settings could be modified and optimized based on the users’ preferences. Once it is set up, the setting should be used for the analysis of the whole set of images.\nClick the “Run” button to start the macro.\nSelect the desired input folder and output folder. Input folder contains all the images that users want to analyze. The output folder will store all processed images and results.\nInput the file suffix according to the file format (For example, type “.tif” for tif file format, “.czi” for Zeiss microscope file).\nClick “OK”.\nA new FFT image for the GREEN channel will be opened and a small window “waiting user” with an OK button will pop up.\nCritical: Do not click “OK” until step 16.\nNote: The macro will automatically process the image and run FFT (the individual function can be found in “process > FFT”). FFT is an algorithm that computes the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) of a sequence, or its Inverse FFT (IFFT). Fourier transformation converts a signal from its original domain to a representation in the frequency domain. In this method, we used FFT to obtain the frequency domain image to eliminate the highly repetitive striation fluorescence pattern of skeletal muscle (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nFFT Based Image Processing (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B):\nSelect the condensed segments above or below the center point of the FFT image that represent the repetitive striated pattern.\nClick the “delete” button on the keyboard to wipe the rectangle area to black. Make sure your foreground and background colors are set to White/Black in ImageJ.\nRepeat the above steps to delete other condensed segments above or below the center point.",
    "Note: Since the pattern of the muscle, as well as the imaging settings, vary, automatically processing is not very reliable at this step. Thus, manual selection of the area is necessary. Although this step is not fully automatic and involves subjective input, the outcome of the analysis is still considered solid since only the repetitive pattern is eliminated and the puncta (AP or AL vesicles) will not be affected.\nOnce the desired segments have been deleted, click the “OK” button on the waiting user window to proceed to the quantification step. The macro will automatically perform inverse FFT to generate processed images containing condensed GFP-positive puncta representing different forms of AP or AL. The image is saved in the output folder. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C (left panel).\nRepeat steps 7–9 for the RED channel. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C (left panel).\nOnce both GREEN and RED channel analyses are complete, a merged image of GFP and RFP is automatically generated as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C (right panel).\nA new window will open showing the total count and total area of GFP and RFP positive puncta, as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D. The average size for the given frame represents the total area/count.\nAfter finishing the current image, the macro will start to process the next image (of a different FDB muscle fiber) and repeat until all the images in the input folder are all processed and analyzed.\nSave the summary results and the file can be opened in Excel for further statistical evaluation."
