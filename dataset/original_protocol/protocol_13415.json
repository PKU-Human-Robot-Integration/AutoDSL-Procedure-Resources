    "All research procedures were approved by the \"Institutional Commission for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals\" of Universidad Católica de Córdoba and followed the National Research Council Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. These procedures were also approved by the authorities of the \"Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud\" of Universidad Católica de Córdoba and \"Instituto de la Visión Cerro\".\n1. Gerbil handling and anesthesia\nNOTE: All animals were specific pathogen-free(SFP) male Mongolian gerbils and were kept in the Center for Research and Development in Immunology and Infectious Diseases (CIDIE) facilities (Córdoba, Argentina). They were obtained from Universidad de La Plata (Buenos Aires, Argentina).\nHouse the gerbils socially in polysulfone cages bedded with corncob bedding. Provide food and filtered tap water in water bottles ad libitum. Ensure the room temperature range is 18 °C to 24 °C and a 12:12 h light-dark cycle is used.\nWeigh each gerbil separately, and identify each one to avoid confusion. Make a mark with an indelible ink marker on the base of the gerbil's tail. Use tweezers to hold the gerbil's ear and make a mark using the indelible marker on the rodent's ear. If a laboratory and a large biotherium are available, assign a unique cage for each rodent with the corresponding identification.\nDisinfect the laminar flow hood with 70% ethanol solution. Place all the surgical and disposable instruments including needles, syringes, and racks in the work area inside the hood. Place a disposable surgical foam in the hood as well.\nUse a small open plastic container to keep the rodent on the precision balance to facilitate measurement.",
    "Use three 6-month-old male Mongolian gerbils of similar sizes and weights (~80 g) for this experiment. One at a time, place each cage with the rodent inside the laminar flow hood. Open the cages, identify each of the gerbils, and weigh them on the scale.\n\tNOTE: Gerbils are harmless but delicate animals. Wear disposable gloves when handling the gerbils.\nGrasp the gerbil with the non-dominant hand to hold it firmly by the tail. Use the dominant hand, with the thumb and index finger behind the ears, to hold the animal with the ventral region facing upward. Use the little finger to hold the tail.\nFill a syringe with a 30 G needle with 1 mL of ketamine and xylazine. Administer the anesthesia intraperitoneally into the rodent (50-100 mg/kg ketamine and 2 mg/kg xylazine)9 using the dominant hand. The duration of the effect will be approximately 20-50 min (variations may occur).\nTo ensure the gerbil is fully anesthetized, check with a toe pinch, tail pinch, and corneal reflection, etc., prior to making incisions in the cornea.\n\t​NOTE: Perform all the procedures in the right eye only.\n2. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the cornea\nPlace sterile surgical drapes to protect the equipment from secretions or animal hair.\nEnsure one of the operators holds the animal while another operator takes the images. The operator should rest his hands on the equipment while holding the gerbil so that the gerbil's eye is as stable and still as possible to be studied. Rest the hand holding the gerbil on the chin rest..",
    "Start the software that controls the OCT, and press Take Image and then Save Desired Image. Perform multiple sagittal and coronal slices of the cornea. Image the eye under the OCT, and make multiple slices to view the anterior segment of the rodent cornea.\n\tNOTE: If the obtained image is not sharp and the eye has moved slightly, repeat the procedure several times to obtain enough images.\nUsing the OCT software, perform pachymetric measurements of the central and peripheral regions. In the main screen of the software, press Take Image, and then press the Save Desired Image button.\nPerform measurements on the normal or control eye and immediately after phototherapeutic keratectomy on the other rodent eyes.\n3. Excimer laser phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK)\nPlace sterile surgical drapes on the excimer laser device to protect the equipment from secretions or animal hair.\nInstill a drop of topical proparacaine hydrochloride (0.5%) in the eye to be treated 5 min before the surgical procedure.\nUse the non-dominant hand to hold the gerbil firmly. With the dominant hand, open the animal's eyelids so that the images can be captured properly. To be able to focus and obtain a sharp image, ensure that the hands of the person holding the gerbil rest on the head of the equipment. Place the hands holding the animal where a patient would place their neck.\nPerform PTK ablation on the right eye. Use the following parameters: an ablation between 60 µm and 62 µm thick, an optical zone of 3 mm, a duration of 4 s, and a total of 1,867 pulses.\n\tNOTE: PTK is performed only on gerbil 2 and gerbil 3. In this step, the second operator prepares and activates the laser to ablate the corneal tissue.",
    "Immediately after the procedure, take photographs and perform OCT analysis to record and document surface changes in the treated eyes.\nOnce the procedure is completed, place the rodent back in the cage, monitor the vital signs (heart rate: 360 beats per minute; rectal temperature: 37-38.5 °C; respiratory rate: 90 breaths per minute), and let the animal recover from the anesthesia.\n4. Awakening of the gerbils after corneal PTK\nAdminister buprenorphine (0.1mg/kg to 0.05mg/kg) and atipamezole (0.1-1 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injections.\nPlace each gerbil in its respective home cage, and monitor the vital signs for normal awakening (the normal body temperature is 37-39 °C).\nApply an erythromycin ointment to keep the surface clean and prevent infection. Perform this procedure twice per day.\nAdminister buprenorphine (every 6-12 h) subcutaneously (0.01-0.05 mL) for analgesia and eye ointment on two consecutive days after PTK.\n5. Euthanasia method\nPerform euthanasia in the home cage whenever possible.\nIntroduce compressed carbon dioxide (CO2) gas into the home cage. A filling rate of 30%-70% of the chamber volume per minute with CO2 added to the existing air in the home cage is adequate to achieve a mixture that meets the objective (for a 10 L volume chamber, use a flow rate of 3-7 L/min). Use cervical dislocation (as a secondary method of euthanasia) to ensure the death of the rodent.\nAt 24 h and 96 h after surgery for gerbil 2 and gerbil 3, respectively, remove the animal from the home cage to perform the enucleation of the eyeball (both the normal eyeball and the one undergoing surgery) to observe corneal healing.\nPlace the animal on the operating table, and check for the absence of a heartbeat for approximately 1 min.\n6. Eye surgery",
    "Remove the upper and lower eyelids to gain access to the eyeball. Use surgical forceps and scissors to remove the eyelids. The size of the working area is so small and delicate that removing the eyelids allows the eyeball to be enucleated without damaging it.\nTo enucleate the eyeball, make an incision in the external canthus, and guide the scissors in a posterior direction. Repeat this procedure from the internal canthus by separating the eyeball from the orbit.\nSection the optic nerve at the back of the eyeball. It should be clarified that the posterior orbital plexus usually generates slight bleeding when performing this technique, which makes the work difficult.\nIntroduce the eyeball into a microcentrifuge tube with sterile saline solution for 30 s to 1 min to wash out any residual blood.\nPlace the eyeball in a microcentrifuge tube containing 10% formaldehyde for subsequent anatomo-pathological analysis as described below. Take multiple images and photographs.\n7. Anatomo-pathological analysis\nEmbed the whole eye in 10% buffered formalin for 6-24 h.\nCut the tissue using a microtome. Ensure that the cut tissue has a thickness of 3 mm.\nSoak the tissue in 96% alcohol for 30-90 min, and repeat this procedure twice.\nPlace the tissue in isopropyl alcohol for 30-90 min, and repeat this procedure twice.\nPut the tissue in xylene or xylene substitute for 1-3 h.\nEmbed the tissue in liquid kerosene for 1 h minimum.\nUse a block to place the tissue and embed it in liquid paraffin. Allow it to solidify (place it in a cold place), and cut it.\nPrepare the microtome for sectioning according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nSubsequently, use stains such as hematoxylin and eosin.\nObtain pictures with the camera added to the microscope.\nSubscription Required.
