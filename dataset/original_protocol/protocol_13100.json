    "1. Cell culture\nMaintain cells in a humidified 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator and culture with either DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (HeLa and A431 cells) or RPMI supplemented with 15% FBS (U266B1 cells). Culture the cells until they reach 70-80% confluence, then trypsinize them and passage or use them for the assays.\n\t​NOTE: Culture media contained phenol red. No serum starvation was conducted for any cell line prior to conducting the assays.\n2. Stimulator or inhibitor titration using the two-plate assay protocol with adherent cells\nNOTE: This procedure describes how to determine stimulator or inhibitor potencies by generating a concentration-response curve from a dilution series of the test compound.\nCell seeding\n\t\nDispense 50 µL of cells at the pre-optimized density (40,000 HeLa cells/well for both STAT3 and STAT6; 75,000 A431 cells/well for STAT5) into a 96-well tissue culture-treated plate in the appropriate culture medium. Incubate overnight at 37 °C/5% CO2.\n\t\t​NOTE: Optimal cell density and culture incubation time need to be determined.\nDilutions of test compounds\n\t\nPrepare intermediate 2x dilution series of test compound(s) by serially diluting compound(s) (half-log interval dilutions) across 12 wells of a polypropylene 96-well plate into serum-free medium.\n\t\tNOTE: It is recommended to conduct a 12-point, half-log interval concentration-response curve in at least duplicate for an accurate estimation of the EC50 or IC50.\nAlternatively, for hydrophobic, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)-soluble test compounds, perform the initial dilutions in 100% DMSO, and then dilute the compound dilution series into serum-free medium.\n\t\t​NOTE: The assay tolerance to DMSO must be established before conducting a test compound titration in DMSO vehicle. It is important to keep equal solvent concentrations between treated and untreated cells. In addition, when testing serial dilutions of compounds, the solvent concentrations should always remain constant across the dilution series.\nCell treatment",
    "For cell stimulation, add 50 µL of serum-free medium alone (untreated cells) or containing the stimulator (2x).\nIncubate for the pre-optimized time at either room temperature (RT) or 37 °C (interferon (IFN) α2b/20 min at RT for STAT3; epidermal growth factor (EGF)/10 min at RT for STAT5; interleukin (IL)-4/20 min at RT for STAT6). Proceed then to section 2.4.\n\t\tNOTE: Optimal incubation temperature needs to be determined.\nFor cell inhibition, add 25 µL of serum-free medium alone (untreated cells) or containing the inhibitor (4x).\nIncubate for the pre-optimized time at either RT or 37 °C (JAK Inhibitor 1/30 min at RT for STAT3 and STAT6; Erlotinib/15 min at RT for STAT5).\nAdd 25 µL of serum-free medium alone (untreated cells) or containing the stimulator (4x) at its EC80.\nIncubate for the pre-optimized time at either RT or 37 °C (same conditions as for step 2.3.2).\nCell lysis\n\t\nPrepare the kit's specific 1x Supplemented Lysis Buffer as indicated by the manufacturer.\n\t\t​NOTE: It is mandatory to supplement the 1x Lysis Buffer with the 100x Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail diluted to a final concentration of 1x. The 1x Supplemented Lysis Buffer contains 1 mM sodium fluoride, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 2 mM beta-glycerophosphate. Other phosphatase inhibitors are not required and should be avoided. Lysis buffers and phosphatase inhibitors other than those included in the kit are not recommended as they might contain ingredients that could interfere with the measurement.\nCarefully remove and discard the cell culture medium by aspirating the supernatant.\nImmediately add 50 µL of 1x Supplemented Lysis Buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: Lysis Buffer volume (25-50 µL) may be optimized.\nIncubate for 30 min at RT under shaking (orbital plate shaker set at 400 rpm; moderate agitation).",
    "​NOTE: Lysis incubation time (30-60 min) may be optimized. Lysates can be used immediately for target protein detection or frozen at -80 °C.\nTR-FRET detection\n\t\nPrepare the 4x Antibody Detection Mix in 1x Detection Buffer as indicated by the manufacturer.\nIn this transfer step, carefully pipette 15 µL of cell lysate from the 96-well culture plate to a well of a white, low-volume 384-well microplate.\nAdd 15 µL of the Positive Control Lysate and 15 µL of 1x Lysis Buffer (negative control) to separate assay wells.\nAdd 5 μL of 4x Antibody Detection Mix (either Eu-Ab1/FR-Ab2 for detection of the phospho-protein or Eu-Ab3/FR-Ab4 for detection of the total protein) to each of the assay wells.\nCover the plate with a plate sealer and incubate for 1 h up to overnight at RT, depending on the assay (see the corresponding Technical Data Sheet).\n\t\tNOTE: Optimal reading time needs to be optimized for each assay and cell line. The plate can be read several times without a negative effect on the assay performance.\nRemove the adhesive plate sealer and read the plate on a TR-FRET compatible microplate reader.\n\t\t​NOTE: Filter-based fluorometers are recommended, though some monochromator instruments can be used. Verify that the appropriate optic module (filters and mirror) for TR-FRET is installed. Use an excitation wavelength of 320 or 340 nm to excite the Europium chelate. Read assays at both 615 nm (or 620 nm) and 665 nm to detect both the emission from the donor Europium and the acceptor fluorophore, respectively. The instrument settings will depend on the particular reader. Data presented here were obtained using lamp-based excitation, 90 µs delay, 300 µs integration time, and 100 flashes per well. The phospho-STAT4 assay, however, was read using laser excitation to generate higher signal-to-background (S/B) ratios.",
    "3. Stimulator or inhibitor titration using the two-plate assay protocol with suspension cells\nDilution of test compounds\n\t\nPrepare intermediate 2x dilution series of test compound(s) as described in steps 2.2.1 and 2.2.2.\nCell seeding and treatment\n\t\nDispense 20 µL of cells at the pre-optimized density (200,000 U266B1 cells/well for STAT1; 400,000 U266B1 cells/well for STAT4) into a 96-well tissue culture-treated plate in the appropriate culture medium. Directly proceed to cell treatment or incubate 2-4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: This step needs to be optimized for different cell types.\nFor cell stimulation, add 20 µL of serum-free medium alone (untreated cells) or containing the stimulator (2x).\nIncubate for the pre-optimized time at either RT or 37 °C (IFNα2b/15 min at RT for STAT1; IFNα2b/25 min at 37 °C for STAT4). Proceed then to section 3.3.\n\t\tNOTE: Optimal incubation temperature needs to be determined.\nFor cell inhibition, add 10 µL of serum-free medium alone (untreated cells) or containing the inhibitor (4x).\nIncubate for the pre-optimized time at either RT or 37 °C (JAK Inhibitor 1/30 min at RT for STAT1 and STAT4).\nAdd 10 µL of serum-free medium alone (untreated cells) or containing the stimulator (4x) at its EC80.\nIncubate for the pre-optimized time at either RT or 37 °C (same conditions as for step 3.2.3).\nCell lysis\n\t\nPrepare the kit's specific 5x Supplemented Lysis Buffer as indicated by the manufacturer.\n\t\tNOTE: It is mandatory to supplement the 5x Lysis Buffer with the 100x Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail diluted to a final concentration of 5x. The 5x Supplemented Lysis Buffer contains 5 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mM beta-glycerophosphate. Other phosphatase inhibitors are not required and should be avoided.\nAdd 10 µL of 5x Supplemented Lysis Buffer.",
    "Incubate for 30 min at RT under shaking (orbital plate shaker set at 400 rpm; moderate agitation).\n\t\t​NOTE: Lysis incubation time (30-60 min) may be optimized. Lysates can be used immediately for target protein detection or frozen at -80 °C.\nTR-FRET detection\n\t\nFollowing cell lysis, conduct the TR-FRET detection step as described in section 2.5 for the 2-plate assay protocol for adherent cells.\n4. Stimulator titration using the one-plate assay protocol with adherent or suspension cells\nDilution of test compounds\n\t\nPrepare intermediate dilution series of test compound(s) at 3x by serially diluting compound(s) (half-log interval dilutions) across 12 wells of a polypropylene 96-well plate into serum-free medium.\nCell seeding and treatment\n\t\nDispense 8 µL of cells at the pre-optimized density (160,000 U266B1 cells/well for STAT4; 80,000 HeLa cells/well for STAT6), in the appropriate serum-free culture medium, into a white, low-volume 384well assay plate. Directly proceed to cell treatment or incubate 2-4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: The requirement for a cell culture incubation period before treatment needs to be determined for different cell types.\nFor cell stimulation, add 4 µL of serum-free medium alone (untreated cells) or containing the stimulator (3x).\nIncubate for the pre-optimized time at either room temperature or 37 °C (IFNα2b/25 min at 37°C for STAT4; IL-4/20 min at 37°C for STAT6).

The plate can be read several times without a negative effect on the assay performance.\nRemove the adhesive plate sealer. Read the plate on a TR-FRET-compatible microplate reader.\n5. Data analysis\nCalculate the TR-FRET ratio for each well using the following formula (1):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62915/62915eq01.jpg (1)\n\tNOTE: Because the TR-FRET signal is read in a time-resolved mode, background subtraction is usually not necessary. If background subtraction is conducted, use the cell-free wells containing the 1x Supplemented Lysis Buffer (negative control) for background subtraction. Determine the average TR-FRET ratio from the cell-free wells and then subtract this value from the TR-FRET ratio of each well.\nFor concentration-response curves, analyze the data according to a nonlinear regression using the 4 parameter logistic equation (sigmoidal dose-response curve with variable slope) and a 1/Y2 data weighting to generate EC50 or IC50 values.\nFor the Z' factor experiment, analyze the data according to the following formula (2)10\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62915/62915eq02.jpg (2)\n\tWhere µ and σ are the mean values and standard deviations for the positive control (p; stimulated cells) and negative control (n; untreated cells), respectively.\nSubscription Required.
