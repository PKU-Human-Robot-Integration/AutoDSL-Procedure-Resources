    "Fly husbandryEstablish the cross(es) that yield female flies expressing the appropriate fluorescent marker(s) in the desired mutant genetic background (see Note 1). Depending on the complexity of the final genotype this might require multiple successive crosses.The day before the experiment, collect a few (maximum six) young (maximum one week old) female flies and place them together with 2-3 males in a vial with fresh cornmeal agar and 20-30 grains of dry baker’s yeast (see Note 2).Silanization of coverslips (see Note 3)On the day of the experiment, take 5-10 factory clean coverslips and load them into the coverslip holder (see Note 4).Note: Wear gloves.Place 200 µl of silanization solution (5% DCDMS) into the Petri dish/Falcon tube cap (silane reservoir).Place the coverslips next to the silane reservoir in the vacuum desiccator and apply vacuum (Figure 1).Incubate the coverslips for 90-120 min under vacuum at room temperature (RT). The vaporized DCDMS will coat the surface of the coverslips. No changes in color or in transparency of the glass should be observed.The silanized coverslips should be used on the same day and should not be stored.Prepare the TIRF microscopeBefore dissection, start the microscope, load the software and set up the imaging parameters.If controlled temperature is essential, start the incubation chamber around the microscope at least half an hour before starting the imaging.Make sure that the system is calibrated. The refraction index of the ooplasm is close to that of the halocarbon oil (η ~1.41), thus a coverslip with a drop of halocarbon oil could serve as reference.Dissection of the ovaries (see Video 1)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Dissection of the ovaries Load one well (~2 ml) of the dissection plate with 100% ethanol and two other wells with BRB80 (see Recipes). Use the black plastic plate as a workplace for the fly and ovary manipulations.",
    "Anesthetize a female fly and place it into the well with ethanol (see Note 5).After 4-5 sec incubation, transfer the fly into a well with BRB80 using a #55 forceps, and after another 4-5 sec transfer to the last well containing BRB80.Under a moderate magnification (10-15x) of the dissection microscope, with the #5 forceps in your non-dominant hand, crush the thorax of the fly to destroy it killing the animal and to maintain a firm grip. With the # 55 forceps, gently pierce the ventral-posterior side of the abdomen close to the midline. Open the abdomen by removing the posterior part by pulling. Take out the pair of ovaries and transfer it to a clean, non-silanized coverslip in a drop of BRB80.Place two drops of 1% IB (see Recipes) (~4-5 µl) on the same coverslip. Transfer the ovaries sequentially into each drop to remove BRB80 from around them. Transfer the ovaries into a ~2 µl drop of 1% IB in the center of a silanized coverslip.Note: Silanized coverslips needs to be used from this step onward.Extraction of the ooplasm (see Videos 2 and 3)Place a drop of halocarbon oil on the silanized coverslip such that it forms an interface with the drop containing the ovaries (see Video 2).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Separation and sorting of the ovarioles Wipe the tungsten needles with 100% ethanol and then rinse them in 1% IB.Increase the magnification to about 20-25x. Using the two needles, separate the ovarioles (strings of egg-chambers) from each other. Identify ovarioles that contain egg-chambers of the developmental stage of interest (stage 9 or older, Figure 2A). Carefully remove the older stages with the needles Note: By crossing them, using them as scissors.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170629/20170629025747_5259.jpgFigure 2. Drosophila egg-chambers under the microscope. A. Different stages of Drosophila oogenesis.",
    "The oocyte and its 15 sibling cells (nurse cells) form a syncytium in the germarium through a series of incomplete cell divisions. These 16 cells stay interconnected by cytoplasmic bridges and become encapsulated by a layer of somatic follicle cells forming the egg-chambers. The egg-chambers mature/go through 14 different stages of oogenesis to give rise to a mature egg (for more details, please refer to e.g., [Bastock and St Johnston, 2008]). To visualize the different cell types, wash-free in situ hybridization to oskar mRNA was performed using a mixture of three different FIT probes (Hovelmann et al., 2013). Scale bar is 50 µm. B-D. Different steps of ooplasm extraction from a stage 9 oocyte (stills taken from Video 3). Scale bar is 500 µm (B-D).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Ex vivo ooplasmic preparation Using your dominant hand, grab the trimmed ovariole on the side of the germarium and gently pull it under the oil.Repeat steps E4 and E5. Ideally, one should have 5-10 egg-chambers of interest under the oil before proceeding further.Zoom to about 40x magnification. Under the oil, first remove any egg-chambers younger than the stage of interest (e.g., stage 9), then start pricking the nurse cells (trophic sister cells of the oocyte) at the anterior tip of the egg-chamber (Figure 2B, see Video 3).When none or only a few nurse cells remain, gently grab the oocyte-containing follicle sack (‘oocyte sack’) at the posterior pole with the needle in your dominant hand and start pulling it away from the rubble of nurse cells (Figure 2C).The ooplasm should start flowing out. Adjust the speed of pulling to allow the ooplasm to touch the coverslip and adhere. You may help this adhesion with the other needle by creating tension anterior to the ooplasm (see Note 3).",
    "Depending on the speed of pulling, the size of the ooplasm and the hydrophobicity of the coverslip, one to several round droplets of ooplasm (containing numerous large 1-10 µm large yolk vesicles visible under 40x zoom) should form (Figure 2D).Troubleshooting: A too hydrophilic glass will result in an almost instantaneous, uncontrollable release of the ooplasm onto the surface, whereas a too hydrophobic glass usually repels the ‘oocyte sack’, causing it to float away from the surface. In either case, it is advised to restart the protocol from step B1, reducing or increasing the silanization time, respectively. Repeat steps E7-E9 to deposit more ooplasmic extracts on the same cover glass. Ideally, four-six of such preparations (i.e., replicates) can be placed on one 22 x 22 mm coverslip.TIRF microscopyLoad the coverslip onto the stand of the microscope using a coverslip holder (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170629/20170629030052_2166.jpgFigure 3. Custom made coverslip holder. The basis of this coverslip holder is a plastic block with dimensions of a standard microscopy slide (76 x 25 x 2-3 mm) containing a 16-18 mm wide, 16-18 mm deep incision in one of its long sides. A hand cut piece of a (used) X-ray film (~40 x 25 mm, with a similar incision) is secured to the bottom of the plastic block by using two strips of double-sided adhesive tape. The two strips of adhesive tape should be placed such that the used coverslip (e.g., 22 x 22 mm) should fit firmly–in this example, these two strips are placed 22 mm apart. The silanized coverslips carrying the halocarbon oil with the ooplasmic squashes can be slid between the plastic block and the piece of X-ray film like a drawer. Scale unit is cm.Using transmitted light, focus the specimen and locate one of the ooplasmic droplets.",
    "Droplets of ooplasm are recognized by the presence of yolk granules (Figures 4A and 4B), which are absent from the nurse cell cytoplasm (Figure 4C) (see Note 6). Sometimes, the membrane of the oocyte–reinforced by the forming vitelline layer–remains intact and therefore no ooplasm gets into contact with the glass surface. Such malformed oocytes can be recognized by the sharp, positively curved boundary with their surroundings (Figure 4B). Such ooplasms are inaccessible to TIRF microscopy (Figure 4D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170629/20170629030154_9182.jpgFigure 4. Typical appearance of droplets after ex vivo preparation. A, B, D and E. Ooplasmic squash. A and B. Ooplasm from oocytes at mid-oogenetic stages onward can be recognized by the presence of large (1-10 µm) yolk granules. A and E. Sometimes, halocarbon oil droplets get mixed into the ooplasm, indicating that the plasma and the vitelline membranes surrounding the oocyte were removed. C. Droplet of nurse cell cytoplasm. Granularity is much finer than in the ooplasm A and B and very often the gigantic nurse cell nuclei remain intact. B and D. Ooplasm/oocyte with intact membranes (indicated by red arrows). D. In such preparations, the ooplasm cannot get into close contact with the glass surface and therefore no intraooplasmic complexes and organelles are detected by TIRF microscopy. E. In proper ooplasmic extracts, complexes and organelles contained within the ooplasm can be detected by TIRF microscopy (green–oskarMS2(10x)-MCP-EGFP mRNPs). Images in D and E were taken on the same day using the same microscopy setup.Optional: if the microscope is equipped with a 2D/3D motorized stage, it is recommended to localize and the store position of all droplets before switching to TIRF microscopy.Start TIRF imaging and adjust parameters, such as exposure time, laser intensity, and camera gain to obtain a good quality signal (Figure 4E).",
    "Temporal resolution is a critical parameter when studying the dynamics of moving objects. For motility analysis of oskar mRNPs, we exposed oskMS2-GFP particles for 20 msec, and simultaneously imaged EB1-mCherry (5 msec) to obtain information regarding the polarity of the underlying microtubule (MT) network. This resulted in a ~10-12 frame per second (FPS) acquisition, during which transported oskar mRNPs traveled ~50-150 nm (pixel size was 140 nm)."
