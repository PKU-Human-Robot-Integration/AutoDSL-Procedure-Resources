    "1. Toolkit installation:\n  1.1. Download and extract the “bmtool.zip” file to a folder of choice. This will create five folders: “doc”, “lib”, “mat”, “txt” and “work”;\n1.2. Start MATLAB;\n1.3. Add the “lib” folder to your MATLAB path \\(File->Set path...->...).\n2. Starting BMTool:\n  2.1. Start MATLAB and change the current directory to the “work” folder created upon installation;\n2.2. At the MATLAB command prompt, type “bmtool”. This will open the BMTool graphical user interface \\(GUI) \\(**Figure 2**).\n3. Using bmtool - the GUI contains a set of panels that are numbered to facilitate the following operation steps. These steps go from loading a dataset to visualizing analysis results:\n  3.1. Load dataset:\n3.1.1. In the “\\(\\(1)) Select input dataset” panel, click on the “Load…” button;\n3.1.2. Locate the desired file \\(for the sample file, by clicking “List files below” straight away this should show the sample data file “vc_mnng.txt” in the list box).\n3.2. Mount datasets for analysis:\n3.2.1. In the “\\(\\(2)) Mount datasets for analysis” panel, make sure the “Agent vs. vehicle control \\(VC)” radio button is selected \\(it should be noted that Agent and VC are arbitrary labels);\n3.2.2. Inform the index of the class that corresponds to the reference class \\(VC) in your dataset \\(1 for 1<sup>st</sup>, 2 for 2<sup>nd</sup> etc);\n3.2.3. Click on “Mount datasets\\!” This will generate 2-class datasets where the VC data is combined with each of the remaining classes at a time. Consequently, the number of mounted datasets will be the number of classes existing in your dataset minus one.\n3.3. Select datasets to be analysed: In the “\\(\\(3)) Select mounted datasets” panel, select the desired datasets, or press the “Select all” button.\n3.4. Generate results:\n3.4.1. In the “\\(\\(4)) Run session” panel, tick the “BM1 …”, “BM2 …” and “BM3 …” checkboxes.",
    "**Tip:** recommended values:\n  - for BM2: “Number of variables”: 1; “k for k-fold cross-validation”: 10;\n  - for BM3: “Top number of variables”: 3; “Number of bootstraps”: 500.\n3.4.2. Press the “Run\\!” button.\n**Caution:** BM3 is much more time-consuming than the other methods and can be left out in a preliminary analysis that shows only results from BM1 and BM2. You can also run BM3 alone with a small number of bootstraps \\(_e.g._, 20). This will give you an idea of the time taken to run the final result.\n3.5. Visualize results:\n3.5.1. In the “\\(\\(5)) Manipulate results” panel, select which results you want to visualize or press the “Select all” button;\n3.5.2. Select the type of visualization that you want to generate. Please note the availability of certain visualization types is conditioned to which results were generated:\n  - To visualize the curves generated by each method, select “Mixed: BM curves” from the visualization options and click on “Visualize\\!” \\(see example in **Figure 3a**);\n  - To visualize only the biomarker locations \\(without the curves), select “Mixed: Biomarker-localization plots” from the visualization options and click on “Visualize\\!” \\(see example in **Figure 3b**);\n  - To visualize the biomarkers in form of a report in MATLAB command window, select “Biomarker-localization report” and click on “Visualize\\!”."
