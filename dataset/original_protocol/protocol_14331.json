    "The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Low Vision Academy and all subjects signed a written consent in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. This research study has received ethical approval from both Loughborough and Sheffield Universities.\nNOTE: The inclusion and exclusion criteria of dry age-related macular degeneration patients to receive suprachoroidal autologous graft by Limoli Retinal Restoration Technique (LRRT) is described in Table 1.\n1. Diagnosis of Dry Age-related Macular Degeneration Patients\nAscertain the diagnosis with confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope, SD-OCT, and MY.\nEvaluate each group's BCVA for far and near distance. Measure VA for near vision (close-up) in points (Pts). Measure BCVA at time 0 (T0), 90 (T90), and 180 days (T180) compared to early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (EDTRS) charts at 4 meters in logMAR.\nRecord electrical scotopic, mesopic, and photopic cell activity, or flash ERG, according to the standards set in 2009 by the International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV)11.\n2. Anesthetization\nNOTE: The gold standard in anesthesia during LRRT is topical anesthesia, reinforced by sub-tenon's infiltration of anesthetic and sedation. In specific cases, general anesthesia is preferred.\nObtain corneal and conjunctival anesthesia by applying topical local anesthetics instilled dropwise 15 - 20 min before the surgery with lidocaine at 4% and ropivacaine at 1%.\nInject anesthesia by infiltration directly into sub-conjunctival and subtenon's spaces.\nUse local infiltration both in the abdominal region, before the adipose tissue is extracted, and in the sub-conjunctival and sub-tenon's spaces, 12 mm from the limbus. Adopt local anesthetic of carbocaine or marcain mixed with 1,200 IU epinephrine.\nProvide intraoperative sedation through the anesthetic, which can be performed properly by using fentanyl as a narcotic analgesic through repeated small boli. The dosage is generally 0.025 mg of fentanyl with 1 mg of midazolam per bolus.",
    "3. Limoli Retinal Restoration Technique Preparation\nNOTE: This technique represents a variant of Pelaez's intervention by which orbital autologous fat is transplanted in the subscleral space1,6,7,12. Surgically grafted cells can produce many GFs with neurotrophic and angiotrophic properties in the surrounding tissue, choroid, and retina18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25. In LRRT, the distance between grafted autologous cells and choroid is reduced by means of deep sclerectomy, and the contact area between the stalk and choroid is expanded to promote the paracrine autologous cell secretion into the choroidal flow9,10,14.\nPerform proper disinfection of each eye before surgery with cellular grafting between the choroid and sclera, a procedure called Limoli Retinal Restoration Technique (LRRT)15,16,17.\nGraft the ADSCs, obtained by Coleman et al. and Lawrence's technique (Figure 1) from abdominal fat, in the SVF in the sovrachoroidal space15,16,17.\nInfiltrate adipose pedicle with platelets derived from PRP gel obtained through the following steps.\nCentrifuge blood6,12 and collect platelet-rich plasma (PRP). The stimulus to platelet degranulation causes GF release in the adipose pedicle6,12.\n4. Technical Specifications and Strategy\nNote: Fat tissue is collected and purified from the abdominal subcutaneous layer of patients, according to the Lawrence and Coleman technique17(Table of Materials).\nManually harvest 10 mL of fat tissue from the abdominal subcutaneous layer of each patient, using a 3-mm blunt cannula connected to a locking syringe, according to the Lawrence and Coleman technique17 (Figures 2A/2B).\nSeparate pure SVF of fat tissue from blood, fat, oil, and liquid by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,500 x g at 20 °C (Figure 2C). The SVF is very rich of ADSCs17.\nCollect 8 mL of human peripheral blood with a 22 G needle and in a separate tube for PRP preparation.",
    "Centrifuge the collected blood for 5 min at 1,500 x g at 20 °C (Figure 2D). In LRRT, the ensuing changes result in better survival of the autologous fat graft, ADSC proliferation, which favors increased choroidal perfusion, and a more comprehensive modulation of the action of those factors that are secreted only by fat7,11,17.\nBuild the suprachoroidal pocket (more details in step 4, in particular 4.4 and 4.5) to accommodate the graft obtained from orbital fat and saturate the residual volume of this pocket with a mixture of ADSCs from SVF and PRP, obtained according to the Lawrence and Coleman technique17.\n5. Suprachoroidal Autograft by LRRT (Limoli Retinal Restoration Technique): Surgical Procedure and Technical Details\nAnchor the sclera with 6-0 silk suture, near the inferior-temporal limbus.\nOpen the subconjunctival and subtenonian space at 11 mm from the inferior-temporal limbus, using 5.5\" Westcott Tenetomy curved scissors.\nInsert the Limoli-Basile conjunctival retractor in this space to make a scleral surgical field.\nUsing a 5-mm crescent knife angled bevel up, pre-cut a flap on the side in the sclera at 8 mm, from the limbus. The flap hinge is always radial and to the left of the surgeon.\nIn the inferior-temporal quadrant, at 8 mm from the limbus, open a deep scleral door of about 5 mm on the side by radial hinge by using a crescent knife, angled bevel up. Carry out sclerectomy at an adequate depth to view the slate color of the choroid.\nCreate a gap by removing a little operculum in the distal part of the flap, in order to facilitate blood circulation in the subsequent suprachoroidal autograft.\nExtract with ophthalmological forceps the orbital fat from a gap above the inferior oblique muscle. Make sure the extracted fat is sufficiently vascularized to allow it to survive after its implantation.",
    "Gently place the autologous fat flap on the choroidal bed and suture with choroidal 6/0 polyglactin fiber at the proximal edge of the door.\nSuture the scleral flap to avoid compression on the fat pedicle or on its nutrient vessels.\nInfiltrate the stroma of the fat pedicle with 1 mL of PRP gel (obtained by centrifugation of the blood material, separation of the component, and platelet degranulation26) using a 30 G angled (30°) cannula.\nPrepare the sides of the conjunctiva for the suture. Then, remove the conjunctival retractor.\nSuture the conjunctiva, using 6/0 polyglactin fiber.\nBefore closing, leave a space to insert into the subscleral space, between the flap, the choroid, and the choroidal autograft, a small flexible plastic tube with the autologous fat graft.\nSaturate the residual space between the autologous fat graft, choroid, and scleral flaps with 0.5 cc of SVF (rich of ADSCs), previously prepared in step 3.2, by a small flexible plastic tube, inserted into the scleral pocket.\nAfter saturating the residual space, close the suture.\nAfter surgery, administer three days of antibiotic therapy with 500 mg azithromycin. Also, provide eye-drop therapy with an antibiotic and steroid combination, such as Chloramphenicol and Betamethasone, for about 15 - 20 days.\n\tNOTE: An autograft made up of fat cells, ADSCs from SVF, and PRP has now been obtained26. Reduce the distance between the grafted autologous cells and choroid by deep sclerectomy to stimulate paracrine secretion of autologous cells into the choroidal flow. For the same purpose, expand the area of contact between the stalk and choroid.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
