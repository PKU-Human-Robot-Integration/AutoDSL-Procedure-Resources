    "1. Preparing Cells for Imaging\nNOTE: The direct force probe (DFP) can be used for any adherent cell type. Here, NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts are used as the model cell line for this protocol.\nCulture NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% donor bovine serum and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin on a 35-mm glass bottom dish until desired confluency. Maintain cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\t\nBe sure to coat all 35-mm glass bottom dishes with 5 µg/mL of fibronectin (or similar ECM protein), before seeding NIH 3T3 cells for imaging.\n\t\tNOTE: The cells must be fully spread and adherent on the dish for the experiment. There are not any constraints in terms of confluency for the DFP method to work.\nImmediately prior to the experiment, wash the cells twice with PBS followed by a single wash with complete growth medium.\nAdd 3 mL of complete growth medium to the glass bottom dish.\n2. Microscopy and Image Acquisition\nNote: An inverted fluorescence microscope (or equivalent) with micromanipulator installed to the side arm, according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The microscope should also be outfitted with an environmental chamber to maintain the temperature at 37 °C, and CO2 level at 5%. A micromanipulator and microinjector attached to the microscope is also required. An oil immersion 40x/1.3 NA or 60x/1.49 NA (or equivalent objectives) are recommended for the experiments. The microscope should be mounted on a vibration isolation table.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58038/58038fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Nuclear Deformation and Microscope Focusing",
    "A. Maximum nuclear deformation and relaxation of nuclear deformation. Before calculating maximum nuclear deformation, the back edges of the nuclear shapes were first coincided to correct for the translation of deformed nucleus. The shape of the nucleus at the moment of micropipette tip detachment was overlaid on the initial nuclear shape before pulling. The difference in area between the two shapes was measured as ΔA1. The maximum nuclear deformation was defined as ΔA1 divided by the original nuclear area. Similarly, a second parameter, ΔA2, may be defined by overlaying the final steady state nuclear shape after micropipette detachment on the original nuclear shape. B. Focus the cell at plane A and then move the focal plane up to plane B to find the micropipette tip. During imaging, the micropipette was translated to the right (direction of orange arrow).

Load the 0.5 µm diameter tip micropipette onto the pipet holder.",
    "To avoid cell adhesion to the micropipette, pre-treat the micropipette tip with 0.3 mg/mL PLL-g-PEG solution for 1 h at room temperature. Test for adhesion by touching the micropipette to the nucleus without any suction pressure, and then translating the micropipette away from the nucleus. The absence of adhesion can be discerned from a complete lack of nuclear deformation and translation.\n\t\tNOTE: Please follow manufacture suggestions to open the package.\nRaise the objective focal plane above Plane A and the top of the cell to Plane B by adjusting the fine control (Figure 1B, see step 2.4).\nSet the micromanipulator to Coarse control. Slowly bring the micropipette down to Plane B by watching for the silhouette of the micropipette, until the micropipette comes fully into focus.\nOnce the micropipette tip is in focus, set the micromanipulator to Fine control.\nLower the objective to the equatorial plane of the cell (Plane A, Figure 1B) and lower the micropipette to around 15 µm above Plane A (Figure 1B, dashed micropipette).\nSet the compensation pressure (Pc) on the microinjector to desired pressure; wait several seconds for the pressure to stabilize.\n\tNOTE: The optimal pressure set point depends on both cell type and the specific goals of the experiment. For most cases, 300 hPa would be a good starting point.\nEnsure that the micropipette is not clogged by using the Clean setting on the micromanipulator panel and checking to make sure air bubbles emerge from the micropipette tip.\nInsert the tip into the cell by gradually lowering the micropipette until the tip is lightly touching the nuclear surface.",
    "NOTE: When lowering the micropipette, the silhouette of the micropipette tip will become clear as it comes into focus. Before the micropipette touches the nucleus, raise the objective focus and align the micropipette tip with nucleus (same x-y coordinate, higher z-plane). Return the focus back to the equatorial plane of the nucleus (Plane A, Figure 1B) and gradually lower the micropipette tip.\nCreate a seal between the micropipette tip and the nuclear membrane by disconnecting the pressure-supply tube from the microinjection system, thereby opening the end of the micropipette tube to the atmosphere. This step creates a negative pressure equal to Pc on the nuclear surface.\nAcquire images with the microscopes image collection software. Set up an avi-acquisition (video) or nd-acquisition (images) in the image collection software.\n\tNOTE: For any imaging acquiring software, set up real-time video imaging or time-lapse image acquisitions with a short time interval.\nToggle to the corresponding fluorescent imaging channel (i.e., GFP, RFP, etc.) and begin imaging.\nTranslate the micropipette tip away from the body of the cell (to the right, Figure 1B) until the nucleus detaches from the micropipette.\n\tNOTE: Pull the tip along the positive x-direction (to the right in the field of view). The pulling rate can be programmed and controlled by computer or the joystick can be moved manually. We have not found any correlation between the pulling rate and nuclear deformation15 suggesting a primarily elastic response to force.\n3. Data Analysis\nPerform image analysis with any basic image-processing software available. The extent of nuclear deformation can be quantified by either the length strain (Ɛ) or the area strain (Figure 1A). Quantify length strain using Equation 1, where L and L0 represent the lengths of the nucleus at maximum deformation and the initial position, respectively.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58038/58038eq1.jpg (Equation 1)",
