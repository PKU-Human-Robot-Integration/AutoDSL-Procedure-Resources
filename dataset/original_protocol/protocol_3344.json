The contact angle characterizes the effect of the substrate modification.\nUltrasonically wash the Si substrates in ethanol and acetone for 10 min, respectively.\nBlow dry the Si substrate with N2 to remove the solvent.\nPlace the Si substrate in a sealed container together with 5 μL of PFOTS, and then vacuum with a vacuum pump for 30 min.\nMaintain the container in a vacuum-sealed state at 120°C for 2 h to obtain an oleophobic substrate.\nFigure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] shows the contact angle of the OA-Au suspension before and after substrate modification.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3110-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Substrate modification\n(A) Schematic illustration of the preparation process for substrate modification.\n(B) Contact angle of OA-Au suspension before and after modification of the substrate. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] is modified from Zhao et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] with permission from Elsevier.\nNote: The contact angle of the substrate was characterized, revealing that the modified substrate exhibited an increase in the contact angle from 10° to 60° for the OA-Au suspension.\nOptimization of ink parameters\nTiming: <2 h\nThis step describes in detail the optimization of the ink parameters by regulating the ligand content. The optimization criteria for the ink are determined using the SEM and Voronoi cell images.\nDisperse the centrifuged OA-Au NPs in a mixture with a volume ratio of 1:2 of toluene and undecane with different concentrations of OA.",
    "Note: The concentration of the OA-Au used was 1 wt%. The concentrations of OA in the solution were adjusted by a volume ratio, including 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.0 v/v%. Take the volume ratio of 1.0 v/v% as an example, that is, 10 μL of OA is added to 1 mL of OA-Au NPs solution.\nDrop the OA-Au solution with varying concentrations of OA onto the oleophobic substrate, followed by natural evaporation at ∼23°C to form diverse microstructures.\nDetermine the optimization criteria of the ink by direct observation of the nanostructure and quantitative analysis of the degree of structural order by Voronoi cell areas.\nObserve the microstructures using SEM.\nFigure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] presents the corresponding structure of the three concentrations.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3110-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Optimization of ink parameter\n(A‒C) SEM images of assembled OA-Au with 0.1 v/v%, 1.0 v/v% and 2.0 v/v% oleylamine at 30°C, respectively. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] is modified from Zhao et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] with permission from Elsevier.\nNote: When the oleylamine content in the OA-Au suspension was 0.1–0.7 v/v%, OA-Au exhibited a disordered arrangement. Contrastingly, when the content of oleylamine in OA-Au suspension was 0.8–1.5 v/v%, OA-Au demonstrated an orderly arrangement. When the OA content in the OA-Au suspension exceeded 1.5 v/v%, an excessive amount of OA was present, resulting in a molecular film of OA covering the OA-Au surface.\nFigure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] presents the Voronoi cell areas around the centroids of all the particles in the SEM images. When less content of oleylamine (0.1–0.7 v/v%) was present in the OA-Au suspension, the wide dispersion of the Voronoi cell area of OA-Au exhibited a disordered arrangement. As the oleylamine content increased (0.7–1.5 v/v%), the ordered superlattice exhibited a homogeneous Voronoi cell area and a narrower dispersion compared to the disordered phase.",

Relationship between average Voronoi area of individual OA-Au cells in structure and ligand ratio\nThe colored strip represents the error bar. The error bar represents the standard deviation calculated from ten values of Voronoi area. Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] is modified from Zhao et al.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] with permission from Elsevier.\nNote: A Voronoi image comprises a set of continuous polygons consisting of vertical bisectors that connect two straight lines of adjacent points. The polygon area formed using this method is defined as the Voronoi cell area. If the structure is highly ordered FCC structure, its cell area must be consistent. However, when the structure contains defects, the Voronoi cell area is inconsistent in size.\nPreparation of the patterned superlattice array\nTiming:  <20 min\nThis step describes the preparation of the patterned superlattice array in detail, including loading the ink, designing the pattern, and selecting the voltage waveform.\nAdd the OA-Au suspension inks constituting 0.1 or 1.0 v/v% OA to the cartridge.\nNote: Adjust the OA concentration in the mixture to 1.0 v/v% to form superlattice arrays and 0.1 v/v% to generate disordered NP arrays.\nPrint the OA-Au inks using a Dimatix Materials printer (Fujifilm, DMP-2850) equipped with a 1 pL cartridge nozzle for precise droplet production.\nUpload the pre-designed drawings to the printer software, such as a concentric circle, raster, snail, and staggered stripe, as shown in Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A–5D.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3110-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

The Raman system with a focus spot diameter of ∼1 μm, an exposure time of 10 s, and cumulatively measured twice was used to detect all substrates.\nSelect an area of 20 × 20 μm2 for mapping with a scanning step size of 1 μm.",
    "Note: The characteristic peak of the Rhodamine B (Rb) at 1648 cm-1 was selected to evaluate the sensitivity, reproducibility, and quantitative analysis of SERS detection.\nAll the measurements were performed under the below conditions.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3110_2.csv\nFinite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation for electromagnetic field distribution\nTiming:  <2 days\nThis section describes the electric field distribution simulation process of OA-Au superlattice structures using FDTD in detail.\nSimulate the distribution of the EM field in the OA-Au superlattice using FDTD solutions (8.19.1584 × 64) from Lumerical, Canada.\nConstruct a simulation model of the OA-Au superlattice based on SEM images.
