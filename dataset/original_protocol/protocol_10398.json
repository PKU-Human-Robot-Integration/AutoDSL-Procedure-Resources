    "1. Polymer and Agarose Preparation\nNote: Gloves and a lab coat should be worn at all times throughout this protocol. Safety goggles are likewise required during work with any organic solvent or any step with possible splashing. \nPrepare a 5 mg/ml solution of polymer in chloroform. Add 1 ml of chloroform to 5 mg of solid poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(butadiene) (PEO-PBD, EO22-BD37) diblock copolymer in a glass vial and swirl to fully dissolve. Perform all steps using chloroform in a chemical fume hood.\nMix in a fluorescently labeled lipid (purchased already dissolved in chloroform) at a 0.5 mol % final concentration in 99.5 mol % unlabeled polymer.\n\t\nFor example, pipette ~12 µl of a 1 mg/ml fluorescently labeled lipid in chloroform into 997.58 µl PEO-PBD, EO22-BD37 polymer in chloroform (with a molecular weight of 2,950 Daltons) for a final concentration of 0.5 mol % labeled lipid mixed and 99.5 mol % polymer.\nStore solution in an airtight vial with a chloroform-resistant lid at -20 °C. Wrap plumbers tape on vial edge where the lid screws onto the vial and secure the lid on the vial. Wrap another piece of plumbers tape on the outside of the lid and finally wrap Parafilm on the outside of the tape to ensure minimal evaporation.\nMake a 1% w/v agarose solution by mixing 0.5 mg standard agarose in 50 ml water (or 50 ml 100 mM sucrose) in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask. Boil the agarose solution in a standard microwave for ~1 min (or until fully dissolved as noted by the clearing of the solution).\n\tNote: The agarose solution can be used after a few minutes of cooling or allowed to solidify, stored and re-melted using the same procedure.\n2. Agarose Film Preparation",
    "Cut the end off of a 1,000 µl pipette tip to prevent clogging. Using the cut tip, pipette 300 µl of melted agarose solution onto a 25 mm square glass coverslip directly from the manufacturer.\nAllow the agarose to cool to ~65-75 °C prior to deposition. If the agarose is too cool, it will begin to clump on the surface during the spreading process. Conversely, if the agarose is too hot, it will require more spreading to adhere the agarose to the surface.\nHold just the edge of the coverslip with gloved fingers and use the long edge of another 1,000 µl pipette tip to spread the agarose evenly across the surface of the coverslip. Move the pipette tip back and forth across the coverslip until the agarose completely adheres to and covers the coverslip.\nPlace the agarose-coated coverslip onto a piece of Parafilm with the agarose facing up. Once the desired number of coverslips are coated, place the Parafilm with the coverslips into a 37 °C incubator to dehydrate the agarose onto the surface for at least 1 hr.\n\tNote: Dehydration is determined by the disappearance of the visible layer of agarose; the coverslip should look flat and clear. Once the films are fully dehydrated, store coverslips with the agarose surface facing up in a disposable plastic Petri dish.\n3. Polymer Film Formation\nPipette 30 µl prepared polymer solution onto the agarose film.\nHold just the edge of the coverslip with gloved fingers and use the long edge of an 18 G needle to spread the solution across the agarose films using a circular spreading motion. Continue spreading until the solution is evaporated.\n\tNote: Be careful of the sharp end of the needle.",
    "Place the polymer films in a plastic Petri dish polymer side facing up and put the Petri dish into a standard house vacuum desiccator covered in aluminum foil (to prevent photobleaching of the labeled lipid) for at least 1 hr to fully remove any residual solvent.\n4. Formation of Polymersomes\nAdhere a coverwell, either a home-made polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) well (an ~0.5 cm thick block of cured PDMS with ~1 cm diameter of the middle punched out) or a commercially available well to the coverslip coated with the polymer film. Press the coverwell gently onto the polymer-coated coverslip with the polymer facing up until a tight seal is formed between the coverwell and the coverslip. Be careful not to press too hard and break the coverslip.\nAdd 200-500 µl rehydration solution (water is fine, but an array of buffers or medias also works) to the chamber (rehydration volume depends on the size of the coverwell adhered).\nCreate a humidity chamber to decrease evaporation of the rehydration solution. Place a rolled, wet Kimwipe along the edges of a glass Petri dish. Place the polymer film with the adhered coverwell into the humidity chamber and cover with a lid. Cover the Petri dish with aluminum foil to minimize photobleaching. Place the Petri dish onto a hot plate set to 40 °C for at least 30 min.\nAdjust the temperature of the hot plate during rehydration from 24-70 °C to tune the size of the vesicles formed (Figure 5). 70 °C is near the Tm of the agarose so caution should be used when proceeding beyond this temperature.\n5. Characterization of Polymersomes by Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching (FRAP)\nMove the coverslip with the adhered coverwell directly to an inverted microscope for imaging.",
    "Choose the appropriate filter set based upon the fluorescent lipid included in the polymer solution. For Rhodamine-labeled lipids doped into the polymer solutions, use a 560/25 nm excitation filter and a 607/36 nm emission filter, or comparable filter sets.\nUse a 100X oil objective to focus on the top surface of the coverslip where the polymersomes will be adhered. If the polymersomes are especially large (>20 µm) or if the polymer film is too thick, a lower power objective (e.g., 40X) should be used to better visualize the polymersomes.\nIdentify the polymersomes using fluorescence microscopy. Identify polymersomes by the characteristic hollow, spherical vesicle with a diameter >5 µm.\nCharacterize membrane fluidity using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) on a fluorescence microscope containing an adjustable condenser. Due to the adherent nature and tight packing of polymersomes on the substrates, natural motion of the polymersomes is limited, increasing FRAP imaging quality.\n\t\nFocus the microscope on the polymersome of interest. Close the condenser to a small region and ensure that the edge of a polymersome is within the imaging region of interest.\nIncrease the camera exposure and ensure all neutral density filters are removed to effectively photobleach the region of interest. Allow the membrane fluorescence intensity to photobleach for 30-60 sec or until the fluorescence intensity is significantly decreased.\nTurn off the lamp and fully open the condenser. Decrease the exposure back to the starting settings and begin immediately capturing images every 30 sec for 3 min.\nCalculate membrane diffusion coefficients using standard methods12. If the bleached region regains fluorescence intensity within the 3-5 min, this indicates that the membrane is fluid.\n6.
