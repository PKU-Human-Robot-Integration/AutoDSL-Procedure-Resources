    "The authors state that experiments on animals were performed in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC), following the Guidelines of the NIH regarding the care and use of animals for experimental procedures and the regulations set forth by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Duisburg-Essen (Germany).\nPart 1: Setting Up (not Shown on Video)\nPREPARING MATERIALS AND SOLUTIONS (prior to taking the eggs out of the incubator)\nEggs have to be incubated in a humidified incubator for 11 days at 37°C (100°F).\n70% ethanol spray, clean plates, precise clean forceps, 4°C (40°F) cold sterile DMEM on ice and 60  mL sterile syringes\n50 mL Sterile corning tubes have to be half-filled with 4°C cold DMEM to mix the macerated embryos at a ratio of 1:1 (macerated mass: DMEM). As soon as the eggs are taken out of the incubator dissection of the chick embryos has to be started.\nSterilize dissection tools in the autoclave or on the day of dissection, immerse the tools in 70% ethanol for 20 minutes.\nPart 2: Dissection of the Chick Embryos (demonstrated on Video)\nWet the incubated eggs with a 70% ethanol spray for at least 30 seconds and dry them carefully with clean soft paper towels while not shaking the eggs excessively.\nNote: We recommend not dissecting more than 60 chick embryos simultaneously.\nOpen the eggs carefully by dashing against a sharp edge and take out the embryo with caution not destroying the yolk sack or the chick embryo itself.\nSearch for the beginning of the umbilical cord quickly and open the clear wrapping without destroying the yolk sack or any little vessels. Then dissect the umbilical cord with precise clean forceps.\nTake the embryo out of the yolk sack.",
    "Note: Embryos should be decapitated quickly (not shown in the video).\nCollect the embryos in minimal essential medium at 4°C.\nPart 3: Maceration of the Chick Embryos\nTake the plunger out of a 60  mL sterile syringe.\nTransfer approximately 10 embryos into one 60  mL syringe.\nPut the plunger carefully back into the syringe in order not to risk losing macerated material.\nMacerate by pushing down the plunger.\nCollect the macerated mass in the prepared corning tubes half-filled with DMEM at a ratio of 1:1 (macerated mass: DMEM). Using 10 embryos a volume of approximately 25  mL is produced.\nPlace the mixture on a shaker for 45 min at 4°C.\nPart 4: Centrifugation of the Chick Embryo - DMEM Suspension\nTransfer the chick embryo - DMEM suspension into the centrifugation tubes.\nAdd sterile hyaluronidase at a concentration of 1 mg per 25 mg of embryo.\nTare the centrifugation tubes very precisely.\nNote: This step should be performed with caution as centrifugation is run at very high g-force and damage of material or centrifuge could occur if using imbalanced tubes. With a high accuracy weighing machine accordance regarding the three positions after decimal point for all tubes should be received by adjusting the missing amount with DMEM.\nReduce the temperature of the centrifuge to 4°C.\nNote: Also the centrifugation rotor should be stored in a cooling chamber or fridge over night.\nCentrifuge 6 hours at least for 180.000 x g x h. Note: For superior results regarding the separation of the single phases use 266.000 x g x h. If possible, use the vacuum adjustment.\nPart 5: Filtration of the Chick Embryo Extract",
    "After the centrifugation, three phases can be noticed: The upper dingy liquid phase with fatty fragments, the clear liquid phase in the middle and the pellet at the bottom of the centrifugation tube. Note: Shaking or brisk moving of the centrifuged mixture has to be strictly avoided, as this would destroy the result of the centrifugation step by losing the clear central liquid phase.\nNote: All following steps have to be performed under sterile conditions using a laminar air flow bench:\nPipette the clear liquid phase into a filter system with pores of 0.45 μm. Then switch on the connected vacuum pump. \nNote: Do not touch the pellet at the bottom. This would lead to a contamination of the extract and a blockage of the filter system.\nTransfer the pre-extract into a filter system with pores of 0.22 μm and switch on the connected vacuum pump again.  \nAliquot the attained chick embryo extract in sterile 15  mL corning tubes.\nQuickly store the aliquots at -80°C (-62°F). Note: The CEE last for up to two years if stored at -80°C.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
