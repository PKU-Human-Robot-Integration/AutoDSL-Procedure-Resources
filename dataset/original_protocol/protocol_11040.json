    "The experiments in the protocol were approved by the Israeli National Council on Animal Experimentation and comply with the ARVO Statement for using Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research. Female C57BL/6 mice, aged 8-10 weeks, were used for the present study and were exposed to 12/12 h light-dark cycles. The animals were obtained from a commercial source (see Table of Materials).\n1. Cell culture\nCulture B16LS9 cells in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 25 mM HEPES, 1% essential vitamin mixture, 200 U/mL penicillin, and 200 mg/mL streptomycin (see Table of Materials), in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.\nHarvest the cells for injection at 70%-80% confluence.\n2. Animal preparation\nPrepare an anesthetic mixture of ketamine (75 mg/kg body weight) and medetomidine (0.5 mg/kg body weight). Anesthetize the mice by injecting the anesthetic mixture intraperitoneally in a single injection.\nApply topical ophthalmic anesthetic oxybuprocaine (0.4%) to both eyes.\nDilate the mouse pupils by topically applying tropicamide (0.5%).\n3. Creating a conjunctival peritomy and scleral tract into sub-choroidal space\nApply 1.4% hydroxyethylcellulose (see Table of Materials) as a lubricant to both eyes to avoid drying. Apply 0.5% tropicamide to the right eye.\nObserve the operated eye of the mouse under an operating microscope (see Table of Materials). Hold the eyelids open with sterile intraocular forceps.\nUsing intraocular forceps, hold the supero-temporal limbal conjunctiva and pull toward an infra-nasal position22. Secure this position by holding it throughout the whole procedure (Figure 1A).\nUsing a 30 G needle tip, make a small (1-2 mm) conjunctival peritomy in the dorsal-temporal area, approximately 1-2 mm posterior to the limbus.\n\tNOTE: Using finer needles can prevent excessive puncture and allow better precision of tumor location.",
    "Remove excess Tenon's capsule from the opening of the peritomy.\n\tNOTE: Tenon's capsule is a layer of dense connective tissue that surrounds the globe of the eye22.\nIn this location, insert the needle tip to penetrate through the sclera. Make an excision to create a tract into the sub-choroidal space until the brown color of the choroid appears through the exposed white matter of the sclera (Figure 1B).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64632/64632fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Tumor cell inoculation. (A) The supero-temporal limbal conjunctiva is held using intraocular forceps and pulled toward an infra-nasal position. (B) The tip of a 30 G needle is inserted to penetrate through the sclera, and excision is made to create a track into the sub-choroidal space. (C) A syringe loaded with cells and mounted with a 32 G needle is inserted into the track, and the cells are injected.

Inoculation of melanoma cells\nResuspend 70,000 B16LS9 cells in 2 µL of PBS. This amount is estimated per eye.\nLoad the cells into a sterile 10 µL glass Hamilton syringe (see Table of Materials) mounted with a 32 G blunt needle twisted at a 45° angle.\nInsert the loaded syringe needle approximately 2 mm into the track created in step 3.\nInject 2 µL of cell suspension.\nHold the needle in place after injection for 2-3 s until all fluid has cleared.\nRemove the needle by pulling it out gently and slowly to avoid leakage from the track (Figure 1C).",
    "NOTES: Adjusting the speed and force of injection can affect the pattern of tumor development. It is suggested that these parameters be calibrated by individuals experimenting to identify the right force and speed applied. A total of 70,000 cells was determined in preliminary experiments. However, as there may be variations in cell culture types or batches or between mouse strains, calibration of this number is necessary.\n5. Assessing the location of the injection\nObserve the injected eye by OCT scans immediately after melanoma cell inoculation to identify the appearance of retinal detachment (RD), retinal damage, and/or cells at the vitreous23.\n\tNOTES: Re-apply tropicamide, oxybuprocaine, and ethylcellulose as necessary.\nBased on the OCT scans from step 5.1, classify the RD patterns21 according to: (1) local RD-one site of RD; (2) leakage into the vitreous-observing cell material in the vitreous; (3) extended RD-multiple sites of RD.\nPredict the tumor localization based on: (1) local RD-expected choroidal tumors; (2) leakage into the vitreous-expected tumors in the vitreous; (3) extended RD-expected variable and dispersed tumors (Figure 2).\n\t​NOTE: Only mice with local RD (about 50%) are expected to develop tumors that are limited to the choroid.\n6. Predicting tumor size based on RD height\nMeasure the height of local RD in the OCT scans using an OCT segmentation/analysis software (see Table of Materials) and classify according to the following groups: small = <300 µm; medium = 300-400 µm; large = >400 µm.\nAssess the volume that the tumors are expected to reach within 5 days from injection according to the following criteria:\n\tA small RD height is typically observed in small-sized tumors (tumor volume ranging from 0.0059 mm3 to 0.07 mm3 with a mean volume of 0.027 ± 0.005 mm3).",
    "A medium RD height is found in both small and medium-sized tumors (tumor volume ranging from 0.015 mm3 to 0.15 mm3 with a mean volume of 0.056 ± 0.016 mm3).\n\tA large RD height is associated with a wide range of tumor volumes up to 0.36 mm3.\n\tNOTE: The range of expected tumor sizes was obtained from the previous results and divided into three groups of small, medium, and large tumors.\n7. Postoperative procedures\nApply ophthalmic ofloxacin 0.3% topically.\nReverse the anesthesia by injecting atipamezole hydrochloride (3 mg/kg) subcutaneously.\nSubcutaneously inject buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg body weight) twice a day for 3 days to reduce the pain and suffering of animals.\nAt 5 days after melanoma cell injection, evaluate tumor size by following the steps below.\n\t\nAnesthetize the mice as described in step 2.1. Apply tropicamide (0.5%).\nExamine the eyes by longitudinal and sagittal OCT scans and use OCT segmentation/analysis software to measure tumor volume and localization.\nCalculate tumor volume using the formula24: V = a*b*c*6/π (a, b, and c = length, width, and height, respectively).\nExamine tumor size every 2-3 days as described in steps 7.4.1-7.4.3.\n\t\tNOTE: The procedure must be optimized if using different mouse strains or cell lines.\nSubscription Required.
