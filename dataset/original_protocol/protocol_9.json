    "SLIDES PREPARATION\n1)Clean slides with 70% ethanol \\(to remove any grease or dust).\n2)Place a few drops of pellet and let the slide air dry.\n3) Place the slide in an incubator at 90&#xB0;C for one hour and a half to age, or at 37&#xB0;C overnight. In case they need to be used much later, place them at &#x2013;20&#xB0;C for indeterminate time.\nSLIDES TREATMENT\n1)After 1.5 hours in the incubator, let the slide cool and then add 150-200 &#x3BC;l of 0.005%Pepsin/0.001M HCl and place them at 37&#xB0;C for 15 min.\n2)Place them in a coplin jar with PBS 1x for 5 min.\n3) 5 min in post fixation wash \n4) 5 min in Paraformaldehyde/PBS wash\n5) 5 min in PBS 1x\n6) 5 min each in ethanol series: 70%,90%, 100% \\(slides can be left in 100% ethanol until ready to be hybridized).\n7) Before hybridization with probe, slides are taken out and let air dry completely.\nLABELLING OF PROBE\nDIRECT LABELLING \\(NICK TRANSLATION)\nFOR 1&#x3B3; OF DNA\n10ul   DNA\n3ul     Buffer 10X \n0.6ul  dAGC \\(for dUTP/CY-3, red) or 1.8ul dAGT \\(for FluorX-dCTP, green)\n0.3ul  dUTP/CY-3 or 0.9ul for FluorX-dCTP\n3ul     B-mercaptoethanol\n0.3ul  DNApolymerase\n6ul     DNAse \\(1:700 ul H2O)\nH<sub>2</sub>O to reach 30ul final volume\n1)After preparing the labelling mixtures with enzymes and DNA, place it in a water bath at 16&#xB0;C for 2 hours.\n2) After 2 hours, to PRECIPITATE THE PROBE take the appropriate quantity of labelled probe and place it in a new eppendorf \\(for BAC probes 30 ul)\n3)Add to the labelled probe:\n  3 &#x3BC;l Salmon Sperm DNA \\(SSD)\n  10 &#x3BC;l Cot-1 DNA \\(10&#x3BC;l of Cot per 30&#x3BC;l of labelled DNA, so for a cosmid add 15 &#x3BC;l)  \n  1/10 Vol NaAC\n  3 Vol cold EtOH 100% \nPRECIPITATION",
    "1)To precipitate, place eppendorf at &#x2013;80&#xB0;C for 15 min, or at &#x2013;20&#xB0;C for at least 30 min.\n2) Centrifuge at +4&#xB0;C for 20 min.\n3)Take supernatant off and dry the pellet \\(Savant centrifuge could be used to dry pellet in a better way)\n4) Resuspend pellet in Hybridization Mix \n5) Place in thermomixer at room temperature for 10 minutes to mix.\n6) Place probes on dried slides\n7)Place coverslip and seal it with rubber cement.\n8)Place slides in Hybrite \\(Vysis) and start cycle\n       Hybrite temperatures:  Melt: 69&#xB0;C for 2 min\n    \\(human slide)             Hyb: 37&#xB0;C Overnight\nCO- HYBRIDIZATION\nTwo probes are labelled with different fluorochromes and hybridized on the same slide: CY3-dUTP\\(red) and FluorX-dCTP \\(green). They can be easily used because they are both direct labelled probes. \nEach probe is labelled individually, and then they are mixed together and precipitated. \nExample: 30 ul labelled BAC A plus 30 ul labelled BAC B plus 3 ul SSD plus \\(10ul plus 10ul) 20 ul Cot-1 DNA plus 8.3 ul NaAc plus 270 ul EtOH.\nThe rest is the same as the single hybridization protocol.\nRE-HYBRIDIZATION\nA slide can be re-hybridized up to four times \\(at least) with good results. \n1) Remove coverslip from slide\n2)Place slide for 2 hours at 42&#xB0;C in 2x SSC\n3) Rinse in PBS 1x at room temperature.\n4)Place slide for 5 min in each Ethanol: 70%, 90%, 100%\n5)Decrease denaturation time.\nHybrite Temperatures:  Melt: 69&#xB0;C for 1 min\n   \\(human slide)         Hyb: 37&#xB0;C Overnight\nPOST-HYBRIDIZATION WASHES\n&#x2022; 3 washes at 57&#xB0;C in 0.1x SSC for 5min each\n&#x2022; 5 min in DAPI  \\(60 ml of 2x SSC, 120 ul DAPI)\n&#x2022; Add a few drops of Antifade DABCO on the coverslip and make sure there are no air bubbles between slide and coverslip\nANALYSIS",
