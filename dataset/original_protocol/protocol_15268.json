    "1. Setting Up for the Study\nPrepare four liters of modified Krebs-Henseleit solution 16 (in mM: 118 NaCl, 3.30 KCl, 2.00 CaCl2, 1.20 MgSO4, 24.0 NaHCO3, 1.20 KH2PO4, 10.0 glucose, 2.00 NaPyruvate, and 20.0 mg/L albumin). The solution should be prepared as close to the start of the experiment as possible. The pH should be adjusted to 7.4 after sterile filtering (pore size: 22 μm, Corning). Solution osmolality should be between 275 and 295 mOsm/kg.\nRinse all tubes and chambers of the working heart system with purified water. Run pumps until all water has been removed from the system.\nAdd cellulose membrane filters (pore size: 5 μm, Advantec) in line with each of the perfusion pumps (Langendorff perfusion pump, left heart perfusion pump, and right heart perfusion pump).\nPerform a two-point calibration (0 and 60 mmHg) for each pressure sensor.\nTurn on the water baths. A heated circulating water bath (Cole Palmer) is used to warm the water-jacketed tubes and heat exchangers. Perfusate is pre-warmed in a separate water bath (Oakton Instruments). Both baths are set to maintain a solution temperature of 37 °C.\nTurn on the pumps to circulate the perfusate in a closed loop. Perfusate passes through microfiber oxygenators (hemofilters) gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 80 kPa. Oxygenated perfusate then flows through heat exchangers to maintain it at a temperature of 37 °C before entering the heart cannulae.\n2. Heart Excision\nBegin by setting the working heart system to operate in constant pressure Langendorff mode. Set the pressure of the aortic block within the range of 50 to 60 mmHg.",
    "Anesthetize the rabbit with an intramuscular injection of ketamine (44 mg/Kg) and xylazine (10 mg/Kg). After the rabbit is sedated, pentobarbital (50 mg/Kg) and heparin (2000 U) is intravenously injected via the marginal ear vein or the lateral saphenous vein on the inside of the hind limb.\nWhen the rabbit is completely non-responsive, as determined by a lack of pain reflex, the thoracic cavity is quickly opened, the pericardium is sliced, the aorta is clamped, and the heart and lungs are excised. At this point the lungs should be left attached to the heart to help with isolating the pulmonary veins.\nIsolate and cannulate the aorta with a 5 mm diameter cannula that is attached to a syringe filled with 60 mL perfusate and 200 units of heparin. Secure the aorta to the cannula with size zero silk suture and slowly depress the syringe to flush the heart of blood.\n3. Biventricular Cannulation\nConnect the heart to the aortic block of the working heart system. Prevent air from entering the aorta, which can cause coronary emboli. It is best to attach the cannula to the aortic block by approaching the aortic connector at an oblique angle and allowing perfusate to gently drip from the connector into the cannula while it is attached.\nWhile the heart is perfused in constant pressure Langendorff mode, remove the fat and connective tissue and locate the following vessels: inferior and superior vena cava, azygos vein, pulmonary artery, pulmonary veins.\nLigate the superior vena cava. Cut the pulmonary artery just below where it branches to the right and left pulmonary arteries.\nGroup all the remaining vessels (the pulmonary veins) between the heart and lungs and ligate them all using one suture. Remove the lungs.",
    "Cut a small hole in the corner of the left atrial appendage. Ensure that the LA is filled with perfusate. Cannulate the LA while ensuring that the cannula is completely filled with perfusate while it is inserted. Suture the cannula to the LA appendage.\nTurn on the left side pump (pump #2) to provide flow to the left atrium. Set preload pressure between 2 - 6 mmHg and adjust ±2 mmHg, as determined by atrial dilation.\nSwitch the heart to the working heart mode by turning off the Langendorff pump (pump #1).\nMomentarily decrease the aortic pressure to 10 mmHg and then slowly increase it to within the range of 80 to 100 mmHg. This will allow the aortic valve to open and function as it would during normal physiologic conditions. The final afterload pressure will depend upon the contractility of the LV. It should be set to a value that is approximately 20 mmHg less than peak LV pressure.\nLV cardiac output can be determined by measuring the flow rate of perfusate exiting the aortic block (mL/min). Normal cardiac output is between 14.77 and 16.43 mL/min per 100 g of body weight 17 and averages 340 mL/min for a 2.2 kg rabbit. Aortic pressure should resemble the pressure signal shown in Figure 1.\nCannulate the RA through the inferior vena cava. Ensure that both the RA and the cannula are completely filled with perfusate and insert the cannula while preventing the formation of air bubbles. Suture the cannula to the vein.\nTurn on the right side pump (pump #3) to provide flow to the right atrium. Set the pressure to approximately 3 mmHg.",
    "Ensure that the RV is filled with perfusate and cannulate the pulmonary artery. Ensure that the cannula is completely filled with perfusate while it is inserted to prevent air bubbles. Suture the cannula to the pulmonary artery.\n4. Signal Acquisition: Pressures, Monophasic Action Potentials, and fNADH\nOnce biventricular cannulation is complete, carefully insert the pressure transducer catheter (Millar) into the aorta via the aorta cannula. Gently navigate it past the aortic valve and into the LV. Monitor the LV pressure signal to ensure proper positioning of the catheter tip. An example of LV pressure is shown in Figure 1.\nGently press the monophasic action potential electrode against ventricular epicardium. Monitor the signal to achieve appropriate action potential measurements. Slight motion artifact in the signal is normal.\nPlace a bipolar stimulus electrode on the right atrium to pace the heart. In our protocol, hearts were paced at cycle lengths between 300 and 150 msec, corresponding to 200 and 400 bpm, respectively.\nMeasure the temperature of the LV epicardial surface. If the study requires that the temperature be maintained at 37 °C then position the heart inside a water-jacketed heart chamber or submerge the heart in a warmed superfusate bath to maintain a constant temperature throughout the heart.\nPosition the CCD camera (Andor iXon DV860, 128x128 pixels) and focus the lens such that an appropriate field of view is observed. The camera is connected to a workstation and images are acquired at 2 fps using Andor SOLIS software.",
    "Turn on the mercury lamp light prior to the start of imaging. Light is directed through an excitation filter (350±25 nm, Chroma Technology) and into a fiber optic light guide (Horiba Jobin Yvon model 1950-1M) to illuminate the surface of the heart. The attenuation of UV light through the light guide is small. UV illumination could also be provided using a high power LED system consisting of LED spotlights (Mightex PLS-0365-030-S) and a control unit (Mightex SLC-SA04-US).\nTurn off the room light and minimize any ambient lighting. Aim the ferrules of the light guide (or LED spotlights) at the heart to achieve uniform epicardial illumination. Emitted NADH fluorescence (fNADH) passes through an emission filter (460±20 nm Chroma Technology) and is imaged by the CCD camera.\nMonitor fNADH changes over time by selecting a region of interest using the imaging software. Select live-update mode to monitor the mean pixel intensity within the region of interest.\nThe heart should be functioning in biventricular working mode to generate appropriate pressures. fNADH levels should be low and stable over the epicardial surface to confirm adequate coronary perfusion. At this point in the study a specific experimental protocol should be implemented to test a hypothesis.\nWhen the study is completed, remove the heart from the system and drain all perfusate. Rinse the system tubing and chambers with purified water. For routine maintenance, the system should be periodically rinsed with Mucasol solution or a diluted hydrogen peroxide solution, as needed.\n5. Off-line Processing of fNADH Images",
    "One way to compare NADH datasets (fNADH(i,j,t)) between experiments is to normalize each fluorescence image using a reference image (fNADH(i,j,t0)) from the dataset9, as shown in the equation below. Another way to normalize NADH fluorescence is to place a small piece of uranyl glass in the field of view before the experiment9, 18, 19. Uranyl glass will fluorescence (450 - 550 nm) when illuminated with UV light to provide a signal that can be used as a stable reference.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4115/4115eq1.jpg\n6. Representative Results\nAnterior and basal views of a biventricular working rabbit heart preparation are shown in Figure 1. Left ventricular pressure was measured by navigating a pressure transducer catheter (Millar SPR-407) past the aortic valve and into the left ventricle. Aortic, pulmonary artery, and left ventricular pressures (LVP) are shown in Figure 1C. Diastolic LVP is usually between 0 and 10 mmHg. The minimum diastolic aortic pressure is approximately 60 mmHg. Peak systolic LVP is dependent upon filling pressure (the preload or LA pressure) and contractility and, optimally, should be between 80 and 100 mmHg. The maximum aortic pressure and maximum LVP should closely match, as shown in Figure 1C.",
    "Monophasic action potentials (MAPs) with a fast depolarization phase and a repolarization phase that are typical for rabbit hearts are shown in Figure 1D. MAPs can be recorded relatively easily from a contracting heart but will usually have small motion artifact during diastole, as shown in Figure 1D. MAPs are useful for confirming successful entrainment of the heart (capture) during pacing and can also be used to measure local electrophysiological changes due to ischemia or other acute perturbations. An ECG could also be measured by submerging the heart in a bath of warm superfusate and placing an electrode in the bath on the left and right sides of the heart. A third indifferent electrode is either placed in the bath, away from the heart, or is attached to the aorta. An ECG will provide information regarding the global excitation and repolarization process, which is useful for evaluating overall electrical function and for revealing the presence of ischemia.",
    "fNADH imaging reveals changes in the mitochondrial redox state of the heart, which can be used to measure the spatiotemporal progression of ischemic or hypoxic regions. For this study, epicardial fNADH was measured to monitor changes in redox state during three pacing rates at cycle lengths (CLs) of 300, 200, and 150 msec. Average fNADH values from a region of interest (red box, Figure 2) show that baseline fNADH levels increase as the cycle length is shortened. When pacing rate is close to sinus rhythm (CL=300 msec) baseline fNADH level is relatively constant. As cycle length is shortened below 300 msec, baseline fNADH levels increase, with the largest increase at the shortest CL (150 msec). High resolution fNADH imaging of the full anterior surface at 200 and 400 bpm is shown in Figure 3. fNADH levels at 200 bpm were constant and spatially homogeneous. At 400 bpm, fNADH levels increased substantially throughout the epicardium. Significant spatial heterogeneity was observed with the largest increases occurring within the septal regions of the RV and LV.\nThe fNADH signal oscillates with contraction (motion artifact) and the frequency of oscillation corresponds to heart rate (Figure 2). In biventricular cannulation, the base of the heart is held by 4 cannulae, which helps to prevent the heart from swinging during contraction. Therefore, oscillation amplitude is always less than any longer time scale (5-10 sec) trends in fNADH that are caused by ischemia or hypoxia.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4115/4115fig1.jpg",
