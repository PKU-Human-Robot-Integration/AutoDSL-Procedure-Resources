    "NOTE: All animal protocols have been approved by the University of Michigan Committee for the Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA).\n1. Cloning of the Sequence of Interest into New Sleeping Beauty Transposons\nNOTE: To insert genes or inhibitory elements (as shRNA) using the Sleeping Beauty transposase system, clone the sequence of interest into the backbone of a pKT or pT2 plasmid. Direct the cloning such that the regulatory elements, gene of interest and markers remain flanked by the inverted repeats (IR/DR). An example of cloning PDGFβ into a pKT backbone is detailed below (see also Figure 1b).\nDigest 5 µg of plasmid vector pKT-IRES-Katushka for 4 hours at 37 °C with 5-10 units of XbaI/XhoI restriction enzymes in 50 µl of reaction volume.\nDigest the mPDGFβ cDNA of 5 µg of the pGEM-T- mPDGFβ plasmid for 4 hours at 37 °C with 5-10 units of NcoI/SacI restriction enzymes.\nPrecipitate the total DNA by adding 2.5 volumes of 100% ethanol, and 1/10 volume of 3 M Na Acetate, pH 5.8 and incubate overnight at -20 °C.\nCentrifuge the samples at 13,800 x g for 15 min.\nWash the DNA pellet with 500 µl of 70% ethanol, centrifuge at 13,800 x g for 1 min, repeat once and re-suspend in 19 µl of sterile DNase free water.\nFollow the manufacturer’s instructions in the Quick Blunting Kit to blunt the ends of both vector (pKT-IRES-Katushka) and insert (mPDGFβ).\nLoad the blunted vector and insert on a 1.2% ethidium bromide stained agarose gel and run at 80 V for 40 min. Visualize the bands, excise them with a clean razor-blade and gel purify the DNA using a gel purifying kit according to manufacturer’s protocol.",
    "Ligate the insert and vector DNA purified in step 1.7 by adding them in a tube at a 4:1 molar ratio (insert:vector). Into this tube, pipette 1 µl of T4 ligase and 2 µl of T4 ligase buffer (containing ATP), and adjust the volume to 20 µl with sterile water. Incubate the ligation reaction for 18 hr at 16 °C.\nTransform chemically competent DH5α bacterial cells with the ligated products.\n\t\nThaw the competent cells on ice.\nAdd the entire volume of the ligation reaction to 50 µl of competent cells, gently shake the tube and incubate the mix on ice for 30 min. Heat-shock the bacteria for 45 sec at 42 °C and return immediately to ice; incubate on ice for another 2 min.\nAdd 950 µl of Luria Broth to the culture and incubate with shaking at 37 °C for 1 hr. Centrifuge bacteria at 2,400 x g for 3 min and re-suspend the pellet in 200 µl of LB.\nSpread the transformed bacteria onto a Petri dish coated with LB-agarose and the corresponding antibiotic. Incubate the plate overnight at 37 °C.\nFinally, collect 5-10 bacterial colonies and culture overnight at 37 °C in 5 ml of LB media with antibiotic.\nPurify plasmid DNA using a plasmid DNA mini kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. Perform a diagnostic restriction digest to verify the proper incorporation of the insert into the vector and submit positive clones for DNA sequencing to ensure the right orientation of the insert.\nSelect the correct colonies and scale up the DNA production using a high quality, endotoxin free plasmid preparation kit.\nElute the DNA in sterile water or 1 mM Tris-HCl. Store DNA at -20 °C until ready to inject into neonates.\n2. Intra-ventricular Neonatal Injections",
    "Three to four weeks prior to experiment, set up a mouse breeding cage with one male and one female mouse, and a plastic colored igloo. This provides an enriched environment and aids the mating process.\nWhen pregnancy is confirmed, remove the male to a new cage. Eighteen days after mating, monitor cage daily for delivery. Perform intraventricular injections on postnatal day 1 (P1).\nPreparation of the injection solution\n\tNOTE: The injection solution is made by mixing the plasmid DNA with the transfection reagent to create the particles for transfection. Below is an example on the preparation of an injection solution using a plasmid encoding the Sleeping Beauty transposase and luciferase: pT2/SB100x-Luc and two transposon plasmids: pT/CAGGS-NRASV12 and pT/CMV-SV40-LgT, at a ratio of 1:2:2. All the plasmids have a concentration of 2 µg/µl. Important details on the preparation of the injection solution are presented in the Discussion.\n\t\nPrepare the DNA solution by adding: 4 µg (2 µl) of pT2/SB100x-Luc, 8 µg (4 µl) of pT/CAGGS-NRASV12 and 8 µg (4 µl) of pT/CMV-SV40-LgT and 10 µl of 10% glucose to a final volume of 20 µl at a concentration of 1 µg /ml DNA and 5% glucose.\nPrepare the PEI solution by adding 2.8 µl of in vivo jet PEI, 7.2 µl of sterile water, and 10 µl of 10% glucose to a final concentration of 5% glucose.\nAdd the PEI solution to the DNA solution, mix and vortex and let sit at room temperature (RT) for 20 min. The solution is now ready for injection. After one hour at RT, keep the solution on ice.\nFit a 10 µl clean syringe equipped with a 30 gauge hypodermic needle with 12.5° bevel into the micropump (Figure 2 #1).",
    "To verify proper functioning of the injection system, use the automatic injector (Figure 2 #1) to withdraw 10 µl of water into the syringe and then empty the syringe completely\nCool the neonatal stereotaxic stage (Figure 2 #3) with a slurry of dry ice and alcohol to a temperature of 2-8°C.\nInduce anesthesia by placing the pups on wet ice for 2 min. Anesthesia will continue on the chilled stereotaxic frame for the remainder of the procedure. Maintaining the temperature of the frame above freezing, between 2-8 °C will prevent thermal burn injuries. As special precaution pups can be wrapped in gauze before placing on wet ice.\nFill the syringe with the DNA/PEI solution.\nImmobilize the pup in the stereotaxic frame by placing its head between the gauze covered ear bars (Figure 2b). Ensure that the dorsal side of the skull is horizontal, parallel to the surface of the frame and that the cranial sutures are clearly visible. Wipe the head with 70% ethanol.\nLower the needle of the syringe and adjust stereotaxic coordinates using dials of the stereotaxic frame until the needle touches the lambda (the midline intersection of the parietal and occipital bones) (Figure 2b).\nLift the needle and adjust stereotaxic coordinates to 0.8 mm lateral and 1.5 mm rostral to the lambda (Figure 2b).\nLower the needle until it touches and slightly dimples the skin. Measure the coordinates. Lower the needle another 1.5 mm. The needle will pierce the skin and skull, and pass through the cortex to enter the lateral ventricle (Figure 2c).\nUsing the automatic injector, inject 0.75 µl of the DNA/PEI solution at a rate of 0.5 µl/min",
    "Keep the pup on the frame for another minute to allow for the solution to disperse into the ventricles. In the meantime, anesthetize another pup, on ice for 2 min in preparation for the next injection.\nGently and slowly lift the needle, and place the pup under a heating lamp. Monitor breathing and activity. If necessary, provide gentle stimulation of the limbs until first breathing ensues.\nReturn the pup to its mother after it has warmed up, has reached a rosy color, is breathing regularly and is active, normally 5-7 min. If more than one pup is injected at a time, keep all pups together until all the injections are done. If injections take longer than 30 min, return half of the pups after the first 30 min and the rest at the end of the procedure.\nMonitor that the dam is responsive and nurturing to her pups. If necessary, add a surrogate mom to the cage.\nEnsure that the interval between placing the pup on ice and placing it under the warming lamp is less than 10 min. The quicker the procedure the better the survival. Usually, the time it takes to anesthetize and inject a pup is 4 min.\n3. Bioluminescence Monitoring of Tumor Formation and Progression\n3.1) Monitoring Plasmid Uptake After Injection\n24-72 hr after injection, remove all pups from the mother’s cage and place in a 6 well clean tissue culture dish, one pup per well.\nPrepare a 30 mg/ml solution of luciferin dissolved in normal saline or phosphate buffer. Prepare this solution in advance and keep in small aliquots at -20 °C.",
    "Using a 1 ml syringe equipped with a 30 gauge hypodermic needle inject 30 µl of luciferin subcutaneously between the shoulder-blades of the pup. Ensure that the needle does not pierce any organs, by pinching the skin and lifting it slightly before inserting the needle.\nImage immediately, using an in vivo bioluminescence imaging system. For the IVIS Spectrum, use the following settings for acquisitions: automatic exposure, large binning, and aperture f = 1.\n3.2) Monitoring Tumor Formation and Progression\nNOTE: Animals will start forming macroscopic tumors detectable by bioluminescence and histology within 2½-6 weeks, depending on the oncogenic plasmids injected.\nUsing a 1 ml syringe equipped with a 26 gauge needle inject 100 µl of a 30 mg/ml luciferin solution intra-peritoneally.\nPlace the animal in the anesthesia chamber. Inject up to five animals at the same time.\nWait 5 min then start the oxygen/isoflurane flow (1.5-2.5% isoflurane) to anesthetize the animals. After 3-4 min, remove the animals from the anesthesia chamber, start the oxygen /isoflurane flow in the bioluminescence chamber. Place the animals in the respective slots equipped with glass nose cones to allow for anesthesia and unobstructed passage of light.\nTypically, acquire a series of 6 images, at 2 min intervals with an automatic exposure time, median binning and an open aperture of f = 1.\nSet the region of interest for all the animals imaged, typically an oval over the head region, and measure the luminescence intensity using the calibrated units photons/s/cm2/sr.\nRecord the maximal value for each animal. Subsequently, recordings can be compared during the progression of the tumor for each animal and/or between animals, for example when different treatments are employed.\n4. Histological and Immunohistochemical Analysis of New GBMs",
    "NOTE: When the tumors have reached the desired experimental time-point, animals can be sacrificed, brains perfused, fixed and analyzed. For survival analyses the moribund stage represents the endpoint of the experiment, when animals are humanely sacrificed at the first signs of tumor burden, as defined by the clinical stage when the animal becomes symptomatic showing impaired mobility, hunched posture and scruffy fur. A brief description of the standard histological and immuno-histochemical methods used is presented below.\n4.1) Perfusion and Fixation\nAnesthetize the mouse with an intra-peritoneal injection of 100 mg/kg of ketamine and 10 mg/kg of xylazine.\nCheck the pedal reflex by pinching the foot of the mouse. When this reflex is abolished, indicating deep anesthesia, immobilize the mouse on a dissection board with pins, open the abdominal cavity, dissect the diaphragm and open the thoracic cavity to visualize the heart.\nInsert a blunt 20 gauge cannula into the left ventricle of the heart. Connect the cannula with plastic tubing passing through a peristaltic pump to a container with oxygenated and heparinized Tyrode’s solution (0.8% NaCl, 0.0264% CaCl2 2H2O, 0.005% NaH2PO4, 0.1% glucose, 0.1%NaHCO3, 0.02% KCl). Start the flow of Tyrode’s solution by adjusting the speed of the peristaltic pump to ensure a slow and constant flow, approximately one drop per second or less if the animals are smaller.\nMake a small incision into the right atrium of the heart to permit the drain of blood and Tyrode’s.\nMonitor perfusion efficiency by observing blanching of internal organs (most obvious in the liver and kidney) as they become devoid of blood.\nWhen the solution draining from the heart is clear (3-5 min), switch the solutions from Tyrode’s to 4% paraformaldehyde for fixation (4% PFA, pH 7.34 in phosphate buffered saline).",
    "Monitor good fixation of the tissues by the increased rigidity of the neck and tail.\nDecapitate the mouse and carefully dissect the brain from the skull.\n\t\nPull the fur which covers the skull rostrally, towards the nose, and grab it firmly to stabilize the head, dorsal side up.\nUsing a sharp scalpel, cut downwards along the edge of the orbit, to transect the orbital muscles and the underlying zygomatic arches.\nTurn head ventral side up and remove attached neck muscles using a rongeur. Crush the first vertebra and remove it from the brainstem.\nVisualize the cochlea, grab the overlying temporal bone with the rongeur and create an opening between the temporal and occipital bone. Peel off the occipital bone from the surface of the cerebellum.\nCrush the bone overlying the nose with the rongeur. Carefully remove the remaining frontal and parietal bones from the surface of the brain being mindful not to damage the surface of the brain. Pay particular attention in the orbital area.\nTurn the head ventral side up. The brain will slide down from the remainder of the skull, connected now solely through the cranial nerves. Using small scissors cut the olfactory, optic and trigeminal nerves. This will release the brain.\nPlace brain in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C for post-fixation.\nFor histological analysis and hematoxylin-eosin staining, transfer the brains to phosphate buffer for 24 hr and then proceed to paraffin embedding.\nFor immuno-histological analysis, transfer brains into a 30% sucrose solution in phosphate buffered saline for 24-48 h (until the brains sink to the bottom of the tube)",
    "Section brains in half through the middle of the tumor region, place the cut side down into a freezing mold, embed into cryo-embedding media (OCT compound), and flash-freeze in a slurry of dry-ice ethanol, dry-ice isopentane or into liquid nitrogen. Keep frozen blocks at -80 °C until sectioning and staining.\n4.2) Hematoxylin-Eosin Staining of Paraffin Embedded Brains for Histo-pathological Analysis of Intrinsic GBMs\nSection paraffin embedded brains at 4 µm thickness, drop in a 42 °C water bath and mount onto glass slides.\nDe-paraffinize slides by placing them for 10 min in a 60 °C oven and then transferring them at 5 min intervals through a series of three slide containers filled with xylene.\nHydrate the slides through a series of ethanol baths: 100% ethanol for 2 min, repeat once, 95% ethanol for 2 min, repeat once, 70% ethanol for 2 min and then transfer slides to water.\nStain the slides by dipping them in a slide container filled with Harris Hematoxylin for 2 min.\nRinse in tap water until water is clear.\nDip slides twice into bluing solution (0.1% Sodium Bicarbonate).\nLet slides stand in tap water for 2 min, then transfer to 80% ethanol for 2 min.\nStain the slides by dipping them in a container filled with Eosin for 5 min.\nDehydrate slides in a series of ethanol baths (80% ethanol 3-4 dips, 95% ethanol 2 min, repeat once, 100% ethanol 2 min, repeat once).\nClear with 3 consecutive baths of xylene, 3 min each.\nCoverslip with a xylene-based mounting medium and let dry on a flat surface at room temperature until ready for imaging. Store at room temperature.\n4.3) Immuno-histochemistry of Cryo-preserved Embedded Brains for Molecular and Cellular Characterization of De Novo Induced GBMs",
    "Retrieve frozen blocks from the -80 °C storage, place into cryostat and allow temperatures to equilibrate for 30 min.\nSection 12-14 µm thick sections and mount 2-3 sections onto positively charged glass slides. Cut sections serially, by collecting adjacent sections on different slides. This allows the staining with different antibodies on adjacent tissue sections within the tumor.\nDry slides in a desiccator for at least 1 hr after sectioning to allow for good adherence of the tissue.\nCreate a hydrophobic barrier (with a hydrophobic marker) at each end of the slide to allow for liquid to cover the sections and to stay on the slide during the washes. Cover the sections with a solution of Phosphate Buffered Saline with 0.1% Triton-X (PBS 0.1% Tx) and gently shake for 5 min on a horizontal shaker to permeabilize the tissue. Repeat twice.\nBlock nonspecific binding with a solution of 10% normal goat serum (or serum from the animal in which the secondary antibody was raised) for 30 min with gentle shaking\nPrepare primary antibody solution in 2% normal goat serum in PBS 0.1% Tx and pipette the solution over the sections. Place slides in a covered humid chamber in the dark and keep at room temperature overnight.\nThe next day, wash sections three times for 5 min with PBS 0.1% Tx and incubate in fluorescent secondary antibody diluted in 2% normal goat serum PBS 0.1% Tx for one hour.",
    "Wash sections three times for 5 min with PBS 0.1% Tx, counterstain with a nuclear stain (e.g., DAPI) for 2 min, wash once more, clear in water and coverslip with a water based mounting medium that will preserve the fluorescence. Place slides on a flat surface and let them cure for at least 24 hr, in the dark, until ready for imaging. Keep at 4 °C thereafter.\n5. Generation of Primary Tumor Cell Lines with Specific Genetic Alterations.\nTo generate cell lines from Sleeping Beauty tumor-bearing mice select a mouse with confirmed large tumor (bioluminescence 107-108 photons/s/cm2/sr).\nEuthanize the mouse with an overdose of isoflurane anesthetic, decapitate the animal and carefully dissect the brain from the skull (as described in section 4). Place the brain in a clean Petri dish.\nUsing a razor blade, make coronal cuts anterior and posterior to the tumor. The location of the tumor is usually recognizable due to the transparency of the brain.\nDissect the tumor, usually 5-7 mm in diameter with fine forceps and place into a 1.5 ml tube filled with 300 µl Neural Stem Cell Media (NSC Media: DMEM/F12 with B-27 supplement, N2 supplement, and Normocin, supplemented with human recombinant EGF and bFGF at a concentration of 20 ng/ml each).\nGently homogenize tumor with a plastic pestle, which fits to the walls of the tube.\nAdd 1 ml of enzyme-free tissue dissociation solution and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.\nPass cell suspension through a 70 µm cell strainer, wash the strainer with 10 ml of NSC media, centrifuge at 300 x g for 4 min, decant supernatant and re-suspend pellet into 7 ml of NSC media.",
    "Plate onto a T25 culture flask and culture at 37 °C in a tissue culture incubator with and atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. After 3 days, some cells have died, some adhered to the bottom of the culture dish, and some are forming neurospheres, freely floating in the media.\nRemove these suspended cells and re-plate onto a T75 tissue culture flask.\nAfter another three days of culture, collect neurospheres, dissociate as described in step 5.6, strain through cell strainer and count cells. Freeze aliquots of cells in Fetal Bovine Serum 10% DMSO and passage cells at a density of one million cells in 14 ml of NSC supplemented with EGF and FGF for a T75 flask. The growth rate will depend on the oncogenes used to generate tumors. Adapt cell culture conditions to prevent overgrowth and maintain cells at relatively high density.\nSubscription Required.
