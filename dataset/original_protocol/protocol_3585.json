    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMicrofluidic devices (day 0)\nTiming: 8 h\nNote: the duration of the preparation depends on the number of microfluidic devices to be prepared. Three microchambers are prepared per experimental conditions. A full day is required to prepare 24 microchambers. We usually perform the preparation in two half days.\nPreparation of the PDMS:\nWeigh 50 g of silicon elastomer (PDMS) and 5 g of curing agent (ratio 10:1) and add both to a disposable plastic cup.\nStir vigorously for 2–3 min and transfer the mixture into two 50 mL conical tubes.\nCentrifuge for 2 min at 210 × g (15°C–25°C).\nFill the epoxy resins with the PDMS mixture.\nRemove air bubbles by incubating the filled resins under vacuum for 1 h (15°C–25°C).\nAllow the PDMS to polymerize for 3 h at 60°C in the oven.\nCritical: It is important to remove any bubbles from the PDMS before polymerization in the oven.\nNote: Epoxy resins containing polymerized PDMS can be stored for up to 1 year in a cupboard to protect them from dust (15°C–25°C).\nUnmold and punch the microfluidic chambers.\nRecover the PDMS pattern from the epoxy resin using a micropipette tip (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/510-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. From the epoxy master mold to the microfluidic device\nFour molds are filled with PDMS. After polymerization in the oven, the solid PDMS patterns are unmolded with a pipette tip (A) and punched to generate the wells (B), as indicated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nFill the epoxy resin as in the step 1.\nNote: Epoxy resins must always be filled with PDMS. After removing the pattern, refill the epoxy resins. These filled resins can be stored indefinitely until the next preparation is needed.\nPunch and cut the PDMS microchambers according to the pattern (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Cut around the pattern with a scalpel blade.\nPunch the three synaptic wells with the 2.5 mm punch.\nPunch the other wells with the 3 mm punch.\nCritical: PDMS is fragile. Unmolding and punching have to be performed gently.\nPause Point: After this step, the microchambers can be stored at room temperature for several weeks (15°C–25°C).\nPreparation of microfluidics devices:\nWash the PDMS microchambers with 96% ethanol.\nPlace the microchambers in a 50 mL conical tube (up to 6 microchambers per tube) filled with 25 mL of 96% ethanol.\nSonicate the microchambers contained within the conical tube (3 × 15 s) using an ultrasound cleaning bath to remove grease and dust.\nNote: The microchambers can stick to each other. Gently shake the conical tube between the three rounds of sonication.\nWash three times with autoclaved Milli-Q water.\nDry the microchambers with a compressed air blow gun and incubate at 60°C for 30 min in the oven (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/510-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Cleaning and sterilization of the microfluidic devices\nThe various steps necessary for the sterilization of the microfluidic devices include: drying the microchambers with a compressed air blow gun (A), passing the PDMS microchambers and small Petri dishes in a plasma cleaner to remove impurities (B and C), sticking the PDMS microchambers to the bottom of the small glass Petri dishes, with the motif side facing down (one chamber per Petri dish) to form an irreversible tight seal (D), repeating a cycle of plasma cleaning with the Petri dishes containing the microchambers and their lids (E). The microchambers contained in the small Petri dishes are sterilized under a UV lamp (F) and placed in a 12-cm Petri dish containing a piece of humidified Whatman filter paper, serving as a humidified chamber (G).",
    "Place the PDMS microchambers (8–10), pattern side up, and glass-bottom Petri dishes (one per microchamber), without the lid, into a plasma cleaner under vacuum for 30 s (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nStick the PDMS microchambers, with the pattern side facing down, to the glass at the bottom of the Petri dish (one chamber per Petri dish) to form an irreversible tight seal (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D) (Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]). Close the Petri dishes with their lids.\nIncubate in the oven at 60°C for 15 min.\nPlace the lids of the Petri dishes face down and the micro chambers stuck to the Petri dishes in the plasma cleaner for 10 s under vacuum (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nThen, quickly close the Petri dishes with their lids.\nSterilize the microchambers contained in the Petri dishes for 20 min under the UV lamp of a culture hood (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F). Maintain the Petri dish lids closed during this step.\nAt the same time, sterilized a 12 cm Petri dish containing a piece of Whatman filter paper under the hood. This 12 cm Petri dish serves as a humidified chamber for up to eight microchamber-containing small Petri dishes.\nUnder a culture hood, humidify the Whatman filter paper with sterile water and place the small Petri dishes in the 12 cm Petri dish (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G).\nNote: it is critical to keep the Whatman filter paper humid to avoid the evaporation of the medium in the microchambers.\nNote: Carefully perform all the steps of sterilization (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nCoating of the microfluidic devices:\nUnder a culture hood, coat the upper and synaptic chambers with 20 μL of poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/mL).",
    "Fill the postsynaptic chamber with 20 μL of a mix of poly-D-lysine (0.1 mg/mL) and laminin (10 μg/mL). This asymmetric coating step generates a gradient of laminin that limits the number of hippocampal axons reaching the synaptic chamber (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nClose the Petri dish lids and incubate the microchambers 12 h at 4°C for coating.\nCritical: It is critical to remove any bubbles that may form when pipetting the coating medium into the microchambers.\nPrimary culture of neurons (day 1)\nTiming: 3 h\nNeurons are isolated from cortices and hippocampi of mouse embryos and plated into the microfluidic devices.\nRinse the coating of the microfluidic devices:\nUnder a culture hood, wash the microchambers three times with filtered Neurobasal medium.\nFill the microchambers with growth medium and place them at 37°C in a tissue-culture incubator.\nPrepare the following solutions under the cell culture hood:\n50 mL of growth medium (Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]) and 30 mL of DM Ky/Mg and OptiMEM glucose. Filter sterilize the solutions.\nFill a 35 mm Petri dish with DM Ky/Mg. Close the lid and place the Petri dish on ice. This Petri dish serves for the dissected cortices and hippocampi.\nFill two 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes with 1 mL of DM Ky/Mg, label them “cortex” and “hippocampus,” and place them on ice.\n100 mL of 1× PBS from 10× PBS and fill a 12 cm Petri dish. Close the lid and place the Petri dish on ice. This Petri dish serves for washing of the uterine horns of the mouse.\nPrepare the dissection bench, wipe the bench clean with 70% ethanol, immerse cleaned forceps and surgical scissors into 70% ethanol, and wipe clean the stereological microscope platform with 70% ethanol.",
    "Anesthetize the mouse by intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine. Check the absence of reflexes by pitching the tip of the tail.\nPlace the animal in dorsal decubitus position and disinfect the lower abdomen part of the mouse with 70% ethanol.\nHarvest the uterine horns:\nHolding the skin with tweezers, make a 1–2 cm mid ventral incision in the skin with surgical scissors, the round tip facing the muscular plane.\nThen, similarly incise the abdominal muscle fibers, the round tip facing the abdominal cavity.\nExtract the uterine horns by cutting and cut the extremities.\nRinse the uterine horns in 1× PBS contained in a 12 cm Petri dish and incise them with fine straight-tip scissors to clear the embryos from their amniotic sac and the placenta.\nNote: The entire dissection procedure is performed at 15°C–25°C. After uterine horn removal, the female mouse is sacrificed by exsanguination.\nDissect the brain tissue.\nTransfer the rinsed embryos into the Petri dish containing the DM Ky/Mg previously chilled at 4°C.\nUnder a stereological microscope, decapitate the fetuses and remove the skin and skull with a tweezers.\nRemove the meninges and dissect out the cortex and the hippocampus using fine straight-tip forceps as described in (Seibenhener and Wooten, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])\nTransfer the cortices and hippocampi into their respective Eppendorf tubes maintained on ice. The next steps are performed under the tissue-culture hood.\nNote: Dissecting the cortices and hippocampi from E15.5 embryos takes up to 1 h if all the offspring are dissected. One pregnant C57BL/6 mouse generally carries 6 to 9 embryos. Both cortical and hippocampal tissues are dissected from the same brain and one embryo yields 4 to 5 million of cortical neurons and 250 000 to 500 000 of hippocampal neurons.\nPrepare the cortical and hippocampal cells suspension:",
    "Transfer the brain structures into a 15 mL conical tube.\nWait for the structures to sediment, discard the supernatant, and add 2 mL optiMEM glucose.\nRepeat the previous step two times.\nMechanically dissociate the structures in optiMEM glucose by repeated pipetting with a Pasteur pipette (Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer.\nNote: We use a Malassez hemocytometer. Trypan blue (50% v/v) can be used to discriminate dead from living cells.\nPipette the volume corresponding to 5 × 106 neurons.\nCentrifuge the cells at 60 × g for 5 min and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the neurons in 100 μL growth medium.\nPlate the neurons on the microfluidics device (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/510-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Freshly plated cortical and hippocampal neurons in a microfluidic device\nTransmission light microscopy image of cortical neurons (left) and hippocampal neurons (right) freshly plated in a microchamber. The two cultures are separated by the microgrooves and the synaptic chamber. Scale bar, 100 μm.\nRemove the growth medium contained in the microchambers.\nAdd growth medium to the synaptic chamber (6 μL in each well).\nAdd 2 μL of the cortical neuron suspension to the presynaptic compartment.\nAdd 2 μL of the hippocampal cell suspension to the postsynaptic compartment.\nNote: As shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], the medium is added to the left wells of the microchambers, whereas it is removed from the right wells of the microchambers.\nCritical: Always fill the synaptic chamber first. The generated flux impedes the subsequently plated neurons from entering the microchannels.\nIncubate the devices for 1 h in the incubator to let the cells sediment.\nAfter 1 h, fill all compartments with up to 20 μL of growth medium.\nVirus infection (day 1 and day 2)\nTiming: 30 min per day",
    "Cells are transduced with the virus 24 h after plating. The virus is removed after a further 24 h.\nNote: Warm up growth medium to 37°C before addition to the cells.\nThe day after the plating (DIV1) infect the neurons with lentivirus (LV).\nDilute 0.2 μL virus in 15 μL growth medium per microchamber.\nRemove the medium of the presynaptic compartment of the microchambers.\nAdd 15 μL of LV.CMV.BDNF-mCherry to the presynaptic compartment and incubate for 24 h.\nNote: It is also possible to use adeno-associated virus (AAV) or to electroporate the neurons with plasmids before plating. Selective infection of the postsynaptic or presynaptic compartments can also be performed.\nAfter 24 h (DIV2), remove the virus and fill the microchambers with growth medium (20 μL).\nAllow the axons and dendrites to grow and form synapses for 10 days.\nRegularly check the levels of medium in the microchambers, as they are prone to dessication. Typically, 10 μL fresh medium is added once per week to maintain the 20 μL volume of growth medium.\nCritical: It is important to not change all the medium to retain the microenvironmental factors secreted by the cells. In addition, humidify the Whatman paper with autoclaved distilled water once per week.\nNote: Axons reach the synaptic chamber between DIV4 and DIV5.\nTreatment and acquisition (DIV12)\nTiming: 3 h\nCells are treated for 3 h with 5 μM of DXM and imaged using a spinning disk confocal system.\nNote: Before performing this step, carefully inspect the microchambers for contamination. Select uncontaminated cultures with healthy neurons.\nUnder a culture hood, prepare DXM at 50 μM by diluting 1 μL of 10 mM DXM in 200 μL growth medium. Warm up to complete dissolution and agitate.",
    "Add 2 μL of 50 μM DXM to the left wells feeding the pre- and postsynaptic compartments. Control microchambers consist of cells treated with DMSO prepared similarly.\nIncubate the treated cells for 3 h in a CO2 incubator.\nRecord live cells using an inverted microscope coupled to a spinning disk confocal system connected to a wide field electron-multiplying CCD camera. Maintain cells at 37°C and 5% CO2. Acquire images every 200 ms for 30 s to study BDNF-mCherry trafficking (63× oil-immersion objective, 1.46 NA). Perform five acquisitions per microchamber and three microchambers per condition. The acquisitions are performed using MetaMorph software (Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nNote: See the Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for the acquisition zone.\nNote: After treatment it also possible to fix neurons in 4% paraformaldehyde and perform an immunostaining.\nNote: Presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments are treated to mimic systemic stress in all brain structures."
