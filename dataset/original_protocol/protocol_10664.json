    "1. Whole-organ Macaque Lung Decellularization\nPreparation of Solutions\nAutoclave 10-15 L of deionized water (dH2O) in 1-2 L bottles.\nPrepare \"Triton solution\" (0.1% Triton X-100 in dH2O) by mixing 1 ml Triton X-100 in 999 ml of dH2O while stirring on a magnetic stirrer. Filter the solution through a 0.22 µm filter apparatus. Store at room temperature.\nPrepare \"SDC solution\" (2% SDC in dH2O) by slowly adding 20 g of sodium deoxycholate (SDC) to ~900 ml dH2O while stirring. Once SDC is dissolved transfer the solution to a graduated cylinder and bring the volume to 1 ml with dH2O. Filter the solution through a 0.22 µm filter apparatus. Store at room temperature.\nPrepare \"NaCl solution\" by adding 58 g of NaCl to ~900 ml of dH2O and stir until completely dissolved. Add dH2O to a final volume of 1 L, filter, and store at room temperature.\nOrgan preparation\nUtmost care must be taken to prevent infectious exposure incidents when working with macaque tissues. Put on the following personal protective equipment (PPE) before handling nonhuman primate tissues: surgical mask, face shield, surgical gloves, disposable gown, and a second layer of surgical gloves.\nCollect intact heart-lung blocs from animal necropsy in PBS containing 50 U/ml heparin to prevent coagulation of external blood.\nWith the lungs lying flat in a dissecting tray, cannulate the pulmonary artery using a female Luer connector with an appropriately sized barb. Secure the cannula in place with an alcohol-sterilized zip tie.\nSlip a sterile zip tie around the trachea, insert a 0.250 in female Luer connector into the tracheal opening, and tighten the zip tie around the barb of the connector to hold the trachea in place around the barb.",
    "Remove trapped air from the lungs by instilling PBS containing 30 U/ml heparin and 5 µg/ml sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Allow the solution to be expelled by natural recoil and repeat instillation twice more. After the third instillation, cap the tracheal Luer cannula with a Luer plug to hold the solution in the lungs.\nCut off the apex of the heart and irrigate the internal ventricles with PBS-heparin-SNP to remove residual blood. Lacerate both atria to facilitate drainage of the pulmonary circuitry upon perfusion.\nSubmerge the heart-lung bloc in dH2O. Fill a 60 ml syringe with the PBS-heparin-SNP solution. Using forceps, submerge the arterial cannula so that all air bubbles escape from the vascular opening. Attach the syringe and carefully remove the plunger and allow the liquid to flow into the vasculature.\nRemove the plug from the tracheal cannula and allow the fluid in the airway to be expelled by natural recoil. Continue to add PBS-heparin-SNP solution to the syringe connected to the vascular cannula in order to maintain ~15-20 cm H2O pressure above the artery. Continue perfusion until as much blood as possible is removed from the pulmonary vasculature.\nDecellularization\nDay 1: Submerge the heart-lung bloc in dH2O. Inflate and perfuse the lung with dH2O using 60 ml syringes attached to the submerged tracheal and arterial cannulae, respectively. Repeat the airway and vascular washes with dH2O 4x more for a total of five rinses.\nRemove the lungs from water and submerge the bloc in Triton solution. Inflate and perfuse the lungs with Triton solution as before. Repeat the instillation a second time, and incubate the submerged organs in Triton solution overnight at 4 °C.",
    "DAY 2: After overnight incubation, remove the lung bloc from Triton solution, wash externally with dH2O, and then submerge the bloc in fresh dH2O. Repeat dH2O washes 5x as in step 1.3.1.\nRemove the lungs from dH2O and submerge in SDC solution. Inflate and perfuse with SDC solution in the same manner as in step 1.3.2. Incubate submerged in SDC solution overnight at 4 °C.\nDAY 3: Wash the tissue again with dH2O as in 1.3.1.\nRemove the tissue from dH2O and submerge in NaCl solution. Inflate and perfuse with NaCl solution in the same manner as in step 1.3.2. Incubate submerged in NaCl solution for 1 hr at room temperature.\nWash the lungs clean of NaCl solution with dH2O as in step 1.3.1.\nPrepare fresh \"DNase solution\" (30 µg/ml DNase, 1.3 mM MgSO4, 2.0 mM CaCl2 in dH2O) Bathe the lungs in this solution and instill into the airway and vasculature as in step 1.3.2. Incubate the lungs in DNase solution for 1 hr at room temperature.\nPrepare fresh \"PBS solution\" (1x PBS + 5x antibiotic/antimycotic). Remove the lungs from DNase solution and wash externally with PBS solution. Submerge the lungs in PBS solution and wash with this solution five times as in step 1.3.1.\nStore the lungs in PBS solution in a sealed container overnight at 4 °C. On the next day (DAY 4), wash the lungs in fresh, ice-cold PBS solution five times as in step 1.3.1 and store in PBS solution in a sterile, sealed container at 4 °C until use.\n2. Large-organ Bioreactor\nAssembly and Tissue Installation\nAssemble breathing loop and vascular loop structures as well as tracheal and vascular cannulae adapters ahead of time (Figure 1). With the exception of sterile-packaged air filters and syringe ports, autoclave all bioreactor components.",
    "Assemble the bioreactor components under a laminar flow hood according to the schematic in Figure 2. Fill the main chamber with culture medium that has been equilibrated to the 5% CO2 atmosphere of a cell culture incubator immediately prior to use in the bioreactor.\nApply the tracheal and vascular cannulae adapters to the lung cannulae and install the organs in the main bioreactor chamber by bathing the lungs in the culture medium and attaching the cannulae adapters to the appropriate ports in the modified lid. Once connected, affix the lid securely and tightly; the chamber will not be opened again for the duration of recellularization.\nFill the tracheal reservoir approximately half-full with culture medium and affix the modified cap.\nApply sterile 0.22 µm syringe filters, Luer plugs, and syringe ports to all chambers as indicated.\nConnect the trachea reservoir to the main chamber via the breathing loop apparatus. Attach the breathing loop tubing as indicated.\nAspirate air from the tubing using the syringe ports and a 60 ml syringe fitted with an 18 G needle; move the directionality of the 3-way stopcocks to direct the flow of liquid into the syringe.\nMove the sealed, contiguously connected bioreactor chambers with installed organs to a tissue culture incubator to equilibrate temperature and gas. Ventilate the lungs using a syringe pump attached to the main chamber at ~1 full \"breath\" every 2 min, and perfuse the vasculature via the peristaltic pump at approximately 10 ml/min for a total of ~30 min.\nAirway seeding\nPrepare suspensions of cells to be seeded into the airway at the desired cell density (volume will depend on organ size).\nInflate the lungs with the cell suspension by gently injecting through the syringe port attached to the three-way stopcock in the breathing loop.",
    "Hold the lungs statically at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight without airway or vascular perfusion to allow cells to attach to the decellularized lung matrix.\nAfter overnight incubation, reinitiate the standard airway ventilation program, and culture the organs for 3-7 days (or other desired duration).\nVascular seeding\nPrepare suspensions of endothelial cell cultures as above for airway cell seeding.\nTransfer the cell suspension to the endothelial-seeding reservoir that contains a small magnetic stir bar.\nChange the directionality of the flow path from the main chamber to the endothelial seeding reservoir by rotating the valve on the stopcock positioned in the tubing connecting these two compartments, and seed endothelial cells gradually while gently stirring using the peristaltic pump.\nWhen seeding is complete (i.e. the volume of endothelial cell suspension is depleted in the endothelial seeding reservoir), stop perfusion and incubate statically for ~4-6 hr. Reinitiate vascular perfusion with main chamber medium at a rate of ~10 ml/min (or desired pressure if monitored).\nCulture for 3-7 days with continuous vascular perfusion.\n3. Troubleshooting and Alternative Approaches\nTracheal cannulation: Sutures can be used in lieu of a zip tie to hold the Luer cannula in place if the trachea is too small. A ¼ in female Luer connection acts as a sufficient cannula for a wide range of trachea diameters.\nRemoving blood by pulmonary artery perfusion: Since tissues are collected from cadaveric animals, microthrombi are common and prevent some areas of the pulmonary capillary bed from being completely cleared of residual blood. During decellularization, however, these small vessels become permeable, and the decellularization reagents efficiently lyse and degrade these clots. Predecellularization perfusion should be performed to clear as much blood as possible, but it is not necessary to remove all traces of blood from the parenchyma.",
    "Expulsion of fluids from the lungs: Macaque lungs retain strong natural recoil ex vivo, even when inflated with fluids. During decellularization, however, cells are lysed and release materials (including DNA) that increase the viscosity of the instilled fluids thereby making them more difficult to expel. Overnight incubation at 4 °C while submerged in the instilled fluid is usually sufficient to allow the lungs to completely expel the viscous fluid. Alternatively, allow as much fluid as possible to be expelled from the lungs and then proceed with instillation of the subsequent solutions; addition of detergents and deionized water washes usually facilitates the removal of the viscous fluids and allows decellularization to proceed efficiently.\nAddition of antibiotics to detergent solutions: Antibiotics and antimycotics can be added to deionized water wash solutions as well as detergent solutions; however, penicillin/streptomycin precipitates in the presence of sodium deoxycholate, and these precipitates may interfere with the decellularization and washing processes. Moreover, the presence of antibiotics/antimycotics is not necessary during decellularization as the detergents used at these concentrations are able to lyse and kill microbes. After decellularization, rinsing and storage with PBS solution (containing 5x penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin B) is sufficient to prevent most contamination.\nRemoval of air from bioreactor tubing: Air is efficiently aspirated from the bioreactor tubing using a syringe with a needle inserted into the needle ports in the three-way stopcocks. Alternatively, 1x PBS or culture media can be flushed through the tubing before installing the organs using a syringe attached in the same manner.",
    "Ventilation and perfusion of lungs during and after recellularization: While the flow rates and times listed in this report were sufficient for cell attachment as well as airway liquid ventilation and vascular perfusion, these values should be determined empirically by the user. Culture times can also be adjusted based on the growth rates of the instilled cells.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
