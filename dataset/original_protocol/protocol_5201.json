    "Amplification of experimental genomic fragmentCustom oligonucleotide primers are designed to amplify the genomic regions of interest and incorporate restriction endonuclease sites at their 5’ ends, ready for subsequent cloning. An additional 8 bp is added to the 5’ end of each primer to increase the efficiency of post-PCR endonuclease digestion. Primer design is performed using Primer3Plus (http://primer3plus.com/cgi-bin/dev/primer3plus.cgi[href=http://primer3plus.com/cgi-bin/dev/primer3plus.cgi]). For the first construct, modeling the variant within the 5’ splice donor site of exon 5 (c.760+2T>C), a 1,457 bp genomic fragment of the TEK gene encompassing all of intron 4, exon 5, intron 5, exon 6 and intron 6 was amplified. This gDNA sequence lacked recognition sites for both XhoI and BamHI endonucleases, so these two sites were incorporated into the primers for downstream cloning. For the second construct, modeling the variant within the 5’ splice donor site of exon 22 (c.3300+2delT), an 831 bp genomic fragment of the TEK gene encompassing all of intron 21, exon 22 and intron 22 was amplified, and XhoI and BamHI recognition sites were also incorporated for subsequent cloning. Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity DNA polymerase is used for amplification, due to its low error rates, fast extension speed and ability to handle larger amplicon sizes. Genomic DNA from both patient and control subjects should be used as template to amplify both mutant and wild-type genomic regions, respectively. Note: If the patient harbors a heterozygous mutation, both mutant and wild-type alleles can be sub-cloned from this single gDNA sample. In 0.2 ml PCR tubes, set up 20 μl PCR reactions as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170511/20170511224700_6231.jpgInclude a negative control sample (add 3 μl water instead of gDNA) to test for DNA contamination.Use the ‘Tm Calculator’ (www.thermofisher.com[href=https://bio-protocol.org/www.thermofisher.com]) to calculate the appropriate annealing temperature for PCR cycling.",
    "If the Tm values are higher than 69 °C, as was the case for the two TEK gene examples, a 2-step cycling protocol using a 72 °C combined annealing-extension step is recommended.PCR cycling should be performed as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170511/20170511224809_5171.jpgAgarose gel electrophoresis should be performed as follows:Prepare a 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer containing SYBR safe DNA gel stain (see Recipes).Add 1 μl of 10x gel loading dye to 4 μl of water and 5 μl of the PCR reaction. Load all 10 μl into a well of the agarose gel. Add 5 μl of HyperLadder 1 kb marker to an adjacent lane of the gel for sizing.Perform agarose gel electrophoresis for approximately 30 min at 120 V.Inspect the gel using a UV lamp gel documentation system. A single distinct band should be present at the expected size (1,485 bp for the TEK exon 5 amplimer and 859 bp for the TEK exon 22 amplimer) before proceeding further (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170511/20170511224916_3491.jpgFigure 2. PCR amplification of genomic fragments. The TEK exon 5 (E5) and exon 22 (E22) amplimers are observed at 1,485 bp and 859 bp, respectively. –ve, PCR negative controls (water substituted for gDNA template) for each amplimer reaction; 1% agarose gel; molecular weight markers are 5 μl of ‘HyperLadder 1 kb’ per lane.Cloning of genomic fragments into pSPL3 exon trapping vectorThe PCR products are now purified and inserted into the multiple cloning site (MCS) of the exon trapping vector, pSPL3. The MCS is located within an intronic region between vector exons V1 and V2. First, the PCR products are purified to remove buffers, unincorporated dNTPs and primers. Then, the vector and PCR products are digested with the relevant restriction endonucleases, in these examples XhoI and BamHI, and again purified. The ‘sticky-ended’ vector and genomic ‘insert’ fragments are then ligated together.",
    "The ligation products are transformed into chemically competent JM109 E. coli cells and plated onto LB plates containing carbenicillin antibiotic for selection of plasmid-carrying bacteria. After incubating the plates overnight, several bacterial colonies are picked, grown up in liquid culture, and their plasmid content harvested. The purified plasmid DNA is then Sanger sequenced to verify which of the plasmid clones contains an insert with the correct content and orientation.Purify the PCR products using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit column following QIAGEN’s instructions. This is the ‘insert’ DNA and should be at a concentration of 50-150 ng/μl. To achieve this concentration, it may be necessary to pool 3 x 20 μl PCR reactions into each purification column and to elute in a final volume of 30 μl elution buffer (EB).The pSPL3 plasmid DNA should also be pure in 1x TE or in EB from a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit purification. This is the ‘vector’ DNA and should be at a concentration of 200-400 ng/μl. If pSPL3 plasmid needs to be harvested from bacteria using a Miniprep Kit, please refer to step 7 of this section (‘Grow up and harvest plasmid from bacterial colonies’).Set up restriction double digestions in 0.5 ml PCR tubes as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170511/20170511225343_1832.jpgIncubate reactions at 37 °C in a water bath for 2 h.Purify the digested DNA products using another QIAquick PCR Purification Kit column following QIAGEN’s instructions. This removes the buffer salts and unwanted small digestion fragments. Elute the insert sample in 30 μl EB and the vector sample in 50 μl EB. DNA concentrations will be approximately 50-70 ng/μl for both insert and vector.",
    "At this point, 5 μl of each sample can be run out on a 1% agarose gel to check fragments are of the expected sizes (1,463 bp for the TEK exon 5 insert fragment, 837 bp for TEK exon 22 insert fragment, and 6,011 bp for the digested pSPL3 vector fragment; Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170511/20170511225447_6947.jpgFigure 3. Fragments of PCR products and pSPL3 vector following restriction digestion with BamHI and XhoI endonucleases. The TEK exon 5 (E5) and exon 22 (E22) fragments are observed at 1,463 bp and 837 bp, respectively. The pSPL3 vector (V) fragment is observed at 6,011 bp. A sample of undigested supercoiled pSPL3 vector (UV) is also included on the gel, migrating at ~4,000 bp. 1% agarose gel; molecular weight markers are 5 μl of ‘HyperLadder 1 kb’ per lane.Next, the insert and vector fragments will be ligated together in a 3:1 molar ratio. The NEBioCalculator tool (https://nebiocalculator.neb.com[href=https://nebiocalculator.neb.com]/) is helpful for calculating the amount of insert required to achieve these molar ratios. The linearized pSPL3 vector fragment is 6.011 kb, and the TEK exon 5 and exon 22 inserts are 1.463 kb and 0.837 kb, respectively. For 200 ng of vector DNA, 146 ng and 84 ng of the insert DNA will be required for each ligation, respectively. Set up ligation reactions in 0.2 ml PCR tubes as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170511/20170511225644_7587.jpgNotes: Add the ligase enzyme last. ‘E5/E22’ refers to the TEK exon 5 and exon 22 inserts, respectively. The ‘vector only’ sample is a control to determine the degree to which vector DNA may be re-ligating to itself in the experimental ‘insert + vector’ sample.Set a PCR thermocycler to incubate the ligation reactions at 16 °C overnight (~16 h), followed by a heat-inactivation step of 65 °C for 10 min, then holding at 4 °C.",
    "Next, transform the ligation products into competent JM109 E. coli using a modified version of the Multiple-Use Protocol supplied by Promega (requires use of less cells):Heat a water bath to exactly 42 °C.For each sample, label and chill a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube on ice.Thaw an aliquot of frozen competent cells on ice.When cells are just thawed (~10 min), gently flick the tube to mix the cells.Add 50 μl of cells to chilled Eppendorf.Add 25 ng (~5 μl) of DNA from ligation reaction to cells and gently flick to mix.Leave tube containing cell-DNA mix on ice for 10 min.Heat-shock cells for 50 sec in the 42 °C water bath and immediately return the tube to ice for 2 min.Add 450 μl of SOC medium (room temperature) and flick to mix.Secure tubes horizontally in an incubator for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking at 225 rpm.Make 1:10 and 1:100 dilutions of the respective transformed cells with SOC medium, as follows: To a clean 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, add 450 μl of SOC medium and 50 μl of the transformed cell suspension and mix by gently flicking the tube–this is the 1:10 dilution. To another clean 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, add 450 μl of SOC medium and 50 μl of the 1:10 cell dilution–this is the 1:100 dilution. Mix all three cell suspensions by gently flicking the tube immediately prior to plating the cells.On 3 LB plates containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin, plate 100 μl of undiluted, 1:10 and 1:100 cell dilutions, respectively. Use a sterile cell spreader, or glass beads, to evenly distribute the cell suspension across each LB plate until all liquid is absorbed into the agar.",
    "Note: An effective cell spreader can be created by melting the end of a Pasteur glass pipette with a Bunsen burner flame so that it forms an ‘L’ shape. Sterilize the glass spreader between cell platings by immersing it into 100% ethanol and burning off the alcohol. Let the glass cool before spreading cells onto another plate. Incubate plates at 37 °C overnight.Examine plates for bacterial colonies. There should be more colonies on the ‘insert + vector’ plates than the ‘vector only’ plates (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170511/20170511225921_7296.jpgFigure 4. Bacterial colony growth on LB plates containing carbenicillin to select for circular pSPL3 plasmid-carrying bacteria. JM109 bacterial cells were transformed with either ‘insert + vector’ (panels A-C) or ‘vector only’ (panels D-F) ligation products and 100 μl was plated undiluted (panels A and D), at a 1:10 dilution (panels B and E), or at a 1:100 dilution (panels C and F). Note: No bacterial colonies were observed on the ‘vector only’ plates.The number of colonies on the ‘vector only’ plate will indicate the proportion of colonies on the ‘insert + vector’ plate that has resulted from vector re-ligation. This should be taken into consideration when deciding upon how many clones to pick in the following steps. If there are twice as many colonies on the ‘insert + vector’ plate compared to the ‘vector only’ plate, then half of the colonies on the ‘insert + vector’ plate are expected to have no insert present. Also, if the genomic DNA sample used to PCR amplify the insert sequence harbored a heterozygous mutation, half of the clones with an insert will contain wild-type sequence and half will contain the mutant sequence.",
    "If there are relatively few colonies on the ‘vector only’ plate, picking 5 colonies from the ‘insert + vector’ plate should suffice to obtain both wild-type and mutant insert-harboring plasmids.Grow up and harvest plasmid from several (5 to 10) bacterial colonies as follows:Label 50 ml Falcon tubes.To each tube add 10 ml of LB media containing carbenicillin (100 μg/ml final concentration).Using a sterile pipette tip, transfer a single bacterial colony from a plate to a liquid media tube. Note: Colonies will be spaced further apart on the serial dilution plates.Vortex the tubes briefly to transfer the bacteria from the submerged pipette tips into the liquid media.Place the tubes into a rack and incubate at 37 °C overnight with shaking at 225 rpm.Before harvesting the plasmid content, make glycerol stocks of the bacterial cultures for long-term storage:To a 2 ml cryovial, add:1)500 μl 50% glycerol (diluted with dH2O).2)500 μl overnight bacterial culture.Gently mix contents until homogeneous.Freeze at -80 °C (viable for years). Note: When recovering at a future date, scrape some of the frozen bacteria from the top of the stock and transfer to an LB plate containing antibiotic (thawing the stock is unnecessary and will reduce the lifetime of the sample).Harvest the plasmid content from the remainder of the overnight culture using a QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit, following QIAGEN’s instructions.NanoDrop the plasmid DNA sample to quantify yield.Sanger sequence the purified plasmid DNA to verify which of the plasmid clones contains an insert with the correct content and orientation. Once validated, these are the final mini-gene constructs–a wild-type and mutant mini-gene for each splice variant being tested.",
    "Transfection of mini-gene constructs into COS-7 cellsNext, COS-7 mammalian cells (adherent, fibroblast-like cells from the kidney of the African Green Monkey) are grown in culture and the wild-type and mutant mini-gene constructs are transfected into the cells using FuGene 6 transfection reagent following Promega’s instructions:COS-7 cells are seeded into 25 cm2 (T25) flasks at 25-40% confluence (6.25 x 105-1 x 106 cells) the day before transfection, so that they are 50-80% confluent the next day. Note: COS-7 cells have a doubling time of ~18 h.Prepare the transfection complex.Note: Include control transfections of only the pSPL3 vector with no gDNA insert, and another with no plasmid (QIAGEN buffer EB only). Allow FuGENE 6 and OptiMEM medium to equilibrate to room temperature.To a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, add:475 μl OptiMEM medium15 μl of FuGENE 6 (without touching the sides of tube with the tip, pipette into the center of the medium)Gently pipette up and down 10 times to mixLet stand for 5 min5 μg (10 μl) of the respective wild-type or mutant pure plasmid DNA (at 500 ng/μl in QIAGEN buffer EB) or EB buffer alone in the control transfection (without touching the sides of tube with the tip, pipette into the center of the medium)Gently pipette up and down 10 times to mixLet stand for 15 minDropwise, using a sterile plastic transfer pipette, add all 500 μl of the transfection mixture to the center of a T25 flask of cells, swirling gently with each drop added.Incubate the cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h.Total RNA isolationNext, total RNA is isolated from the COS-7 cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit following QIAGEN’s instructions:Note: A T25 cell culture flask containing COS-7 cells at 100% confluence (~2.5 x 106 cells) should yield ~80 μg RNA.",
    "Perform all steps including centrifugation at room temperature (21 °C). Add 10 μl 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) to each 1 ml of buffer RLT. Aspirate T25 flask culture medium and wash the cells in 5 ml PBS; aspirate all PBS.Add 3 ml trypsin-EDTA, swirl to coat the cells and quickly aspirate the solution.Incubate cells at 37 °C until they start to detach from the flask (~5 min).Add 5 ml medium containing 10% FBS to inactivate trypsin.Pipette the medium up and down within the flask to resuspend the cells and transfer the mixture to a 50 ml Falcon tube.Pellet the cells by centrifugation at 300 x g for 5 min; aspirate the supernatant.Add 350 μl buffer RLT (containing 2-ME), pipet to mix and add lysate directly into a QIAshredder spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube.Centrifuge for 2 min at max speed in a benchtop centrifuge.Add 350 μl of 70% ethanol to the homogenized lysate; mix well by pipetting. Do not centrifuge at this point.Transfer up to 700 μl of sample (including any precipitate) to an RNeasy spin column placed in a 2 ml collection tube.Centrifuge for 15 sec at 9,000 x g; discard the flow-through.Add 700 μl buffer RW1 to the column.Centrifuge for 15 sec at 9,000 x g to wash the column membrane; discard the flow-through.Add 500 μl buffer RPE (containing ethanol) to the column.Centrifuge for 15 sec at 9,000 x g to wash the membrane; discard the flow-through.Add another 500 μl buffer RPE to the column.Centrifuge for 2 min at 9,000 x g to wash the membrane.Transfer the column to a new 2 ml collection tube and centrifuge at maximum speed for 1 min to remove any residual ethanol.Place the column in a new 1.5 ml collection tube.Add 50 μl RNase-free water directly to the membrane.",
    "Centrifuge for 1 min at 9,000 x g to elute the RNA sample.Add a further 30 μl RNase-free water directly to membrane.Centrifuge for 1 min at 9,000 x g to elute the remaining RNA.NanoDrop the RNA sample to quantify yield (expect ~70 μl total RNA, 400-700 ng/μl).Store the remaining RNA at -80 °C.cDNA generationNext, a High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit is used with random primers to reverse-transcribe RNA into cDNA. To maximize the reaction, RNA samples should first be diluted to 200 ng/μl with RNase-free water. The reverse transcription reaction is then performed to convert 2 μg of total RNA to cDNA in a 20 μl volume, following Applied Biosystems’ instructions:On ice, for each sample, make 10 μl of a 2x RT Master mix:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170511/20170511231404_7982.jpgOn ice, mix the components gently.Pipette 10 μl of the 2x RT Master mix into ice-cold 0.2 ml PCR tubes.Add 10 μl RNA (200 ng/μl) and gently flick to mix.Keep the reaction on ice until loaded into a PCR thermocycler programmed as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170511/20170511231454_7469.jpgStore the resulting cDNA products at -20 °C.RT-PCR analysis of pSPL3-derived transcriptsNext, the splicing vector-transcribed cDNA species are specifically amplified by PCR using primer pairs corresponding to sequences in the vector exons, V1 and V2 (Figures 1A and 1B). The resulting RT-PCR products from the wild-type and mutant mini-genes are visualized by gel electrophoresis and their sequence composition determined by Sanger sequencing (Figure 1C).Note: There is no need to remove the RNA component of the cDNA sample before PCR amplification. Use 4 μl of the cDNA sample as template in a 40 μl PCR reaction. More than 4 μl (10% of the PCR reaction volume) cannot be used, as carry-over of the buffer salts can inhibit the reaction. In 0.2 ml PCR tubes, set up 40 μl PCR reactions as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170511/20170511231600_6204.",
    "jpgNote: Include a negative control sample (add 4 μl water instead of cDNA) to test for reaction contamination.Perform PCR amplification using the following cycling conditions:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170511/20170511231659_7886.jpgAnalyze the PCR amplification products by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel (Figure 1C).Note: The pSPL3 vector with no gDNA insert will generate a single RT-PCR product of 257 bp from vector exons V1 and V2 (Figure 1C). Inclusion of TEK exons 5 and 6 will generate a single RT-PCR product of 530 bp (Figure 1C). Inclusion of TEK exon 22 will generate a single RT-PCR product of 357 bp (Figure 1C). From the mutant exon 5 and exon 22 splice site constructs, single bands of 551 bp and 357 bp are observed, respectively (Figure 1C).Where a single distinct band is present, the sample should be sent for direct Sanger sequencing using primers V1-F and V2-R (Figure 1C). If multiple bands are present, each band should be separately gel extracted (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit) prior to Sanger sequencing.Note: From the mutant TEK exon 5 construct, Sanger sequencing determined the additional transcript content to result from inclusion of 21 bp of intron 5 (Figure 1C). From the mutant TEK exon 22 construct, Sanger sequencing showed a lack of any TEK content in the transcript, with content from vector exons V1 and V2 only, indicating exon 22 is skipped entirely during RNA splicing (Figure 1C)."
