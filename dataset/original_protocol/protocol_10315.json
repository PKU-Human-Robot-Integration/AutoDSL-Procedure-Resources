    "NOTE: Please consult all relevant material safety data sheets (MSDS) before use. Some of the chemicals used in this protocol are toxic and carcinogenic. Please use all appropriate safety practices (fume hood, glovebox) and personal protective equipment (safety glasses, gloves, lab coat, full length pants, closed-toe shoes) when using toxic or acid/base materials.\n1. Fabrication of Master Molds for Soft Lithography using Photolithography\nDraw the layout of the microchannel using a computer-aided design (CAD) drawing tool.\nPrint the layout on a blank mask plate using laser mask writer.\nRinse a 4 inch silicon wafer with acetone followed by isopropanol and dry with a nitrogen air gun to ensure that no solvent is left on the wafer.\nDehydrate the wafer by baking it on a hot plate at 200 °C for 5 min.\nSelect a negative photoresist designed for the desired height of the microchannels. For example, use negative photoresist SU-8 50 to obtain microchannels with a height of 50 µm.\nAllow the wafer to cool to room temperature, and then align the wafer on the chuck of a spin coater.\nDispense 4 mL (1 mL/inch diameter of the wafer) of negative photoresist onto the center of the wafer.\nSpin coat the wafer with a two-step spin cycle using a spinner. First, apply a spread cycle of 500 rpm with an acceleration of 100 rpm/s for 10 s. Then apply a spin cycle of 2,000 rpm with an acceleration of 300 rpm/s2 for 30 s to obtain a 50 µm coating of photoresist on a wafer.",
    "Soft bake the wafer in two steps on a hot plate according to the manufacturer's directions. For a 50 µm coating of photoresist, first pre-bake the wafer at 65 °C for 6 min and then immediately ramp up the hot plate temperature to post-bake the wafer at 95 °C for 20 min.\nAllow the wafer to cool to room temperature and then load the wafer onto the lithography stage.\nAlign the mask on the wafer using mask aligner and expose the wafer to UV light (as per the manufacturer's instructions) at an intensity of 1.5 mW/cm2 for 146 s to apply the total UV dose of 220 mJ/cm2 required for a 50 µm thick layer of photoresist.\nApply post exposure bake to the wafer in two steps on a hot plate. For a 50-µm coating of photoresist, first pre-bake the wafer at 65 °C for 1 min and immediately ramp up the hot plate temperature to post-bake it at 95 °C for 5 min.\nDevelop the wafer in by submerging the wafer in SU-8 developer and gently shaking until the features become clear on the wafer. Develop the wafer for ~6 min for the 50 µm thick photoresist.\nRinse off excess developer with isopropanol and ethanol, then dry the wafer with a nitrogen air gun.\nHard bake the silicon wafer on a hot plate at 150 °C for 15 min.\nPlace the wafer in a desiccator with 25 µL of the silanizing agent tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl-1-trichlorosilane.\n\tNOTE: The silanizing agent is corrosive, thus should be used in an acid/base fume hood, with appropriate personal protective equipment (safety glasses, gloves, lab coat, full length pants, closed-toe shoes).\nApply the vacuum for 5 min and expose the wafer to the vapors of silane for 30 min without releasing the vacuum.",
    "Transfer the wafer into a suitably sized Petri dish.\n2. Fabrication of Master Molds for Soft Lithography Using Adhesive Tape\nDraw the layout of the microchannel using a CAD drawing tool and print the drawing on white paper.\nClean a glass slide large enough to accommodate the design with isopropanol and then dry the slide with an air gun.\nAttach adhesive tape onto the cleaned glass slide. Be careful not to trap any air bubbles.\nTape the sides of the glass slide onto the paper with the design, with the tape side up.\nUse a scalpel to cut the tape on the glass slide using the paper design as a reference and then peel off tape from unwanted areas of the glass slide.\nRinse the glass slide with isopropanol and then dry with an air gun. Bake the glass slide in an oven at 65 °C for 30 min.\nGently roll over the tape with a rubber roller to remove air bubbles and allow the slide to cool to room temperature.\n3. Soft Lithography Fabrication of the PDMS Devices\nMix PDMS elastomer and its curing agent in a ratio of 10:1 (w:w), stir the mixture vigorously, and then degas the mixture by placing it into a vacuum chamber until no air bubbles appear in the mixture.\nPour the mixture onto a silanized silicon mold or adhesive tape mold in a petri dish to obtain a ~2 mm thick layer of PDMS and degas until all air bubbles disappear.\nCure the PDMS in an oven at 65 °C for 2 h.\nUse a scalpel to cut the PDMS layer at least 5 mm away from the features and then peel the cured PDMS off the mold using tweezer.",
    "Punch a single inlet hole with a 1 mm biopsy punch anywhere on the microchannel, preferably at the end of a network of microchannels as seen in Figure 2a and 4b.\nClean the PDMS cast with adhesive tape to remove dust particles adsorbed onto the device. Sterilize the PDMS microchannel device (PDMS cast) by rinsing with a solution of 70% ethanol followed by sterile deionized (DI) water, and expose to UV for 30 min.\nKeep the sterile PDMS device in a sterile petri dish until use.\n4. Substrate Patterning\nPlace the sterile PDMS cast using tweezers onto a sterile glass coverslip or petri dish and apply gentle pressure using the tip of the tweezers.\n\tNOTE: The PDMS cast makes a conformal but reversible seal with the glass coverslip or petri dish forming microchannels without use of any adhesive.\nPlace a droplet (20 - 40 µL) of the substrate solution on the inlet completely covering the inlet hole. Pattern Poly-D-Lysine (PDL) by placing a 20 µL droplet of PDL in sodium tetraborate buffer on the inlet of the microchannels.\nPut the petri dish in a vacuum of ~254 mmHgA (equivalent to house vacuum in biological laboratories) for 10 min, and observe air coming out of the channel in the form of bubbles.\nRelease the vacuum and observe the substrate solution flowing into the microchannel.\nIncubate the dish at the appropriate conditions for substrate adherence. See Tables 1 and 2 for incubation conditions (these vary depending on the substrate). For PDL patterning, incubate for 1 h at 37 °C.\nCarefully peel off the PDMS stamp using sterile tweezers and wash the pattern on glass coverslip thrice with DI water.",
    "Add a 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution to the petri dish to cover the dish or the glass coverslip and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: This will reduce non-specific adherence in uncoated regions.\nAspirate off the 1% BSA solution, and the patterned substrate is now ready to use.\n5. Indirect Patterning of Cells\nPrepare the cell suspension in serum-free culture medium. The cell type and cell density are listed in Table 1.\nAdd the cell suspension to the patterned Petri dish and completely submerge the patterned region in cell suspension.\nIncubate the petri dish at 37 °C in an incubator for 15 min to allow cells to attach to the patterned substrate.\nAspirate the excess cell suspension from the Petri dish and wash the patterned cells three times with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) while gently shaking for 10 s to remove unattached cells.\nAdd the appropriate culture medium to the patterned cell cultures and incubate the patterned cells at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.\n6. Direct Patterning of Cells\nNOTE: This technique is an alternative to the indirect cell patterning described in step 5. However, unlike in step 5, in this technique cells are patterned on tissue culture surfaces with or without substrate coating.\nSterilize the microfluidic device by rinsing with a solution of 70% of ethanol followed by DI water.\nSoak the device overnight in a solution of 1% BSA to prevent the cell adhesion to the PDMS.\nDry the device at room temperature and attach it to the bottom of the tissue culture-treated petri dish.\nPrepare the cell suspension in serum-free culture media. The cell type and cell density are listed in Table 2.",
    "Place a droplet (4 - 8 µL) of the cell suspension, enough to fill the microchannels, on the inlet completely covering the inlet hole.\nPut the petri dish in a vacuum for 10 min and observe air coming out of the channel in the form of bubbles. Release the vacuum and observe the cell suspension flowing into the microchannel.\nIncubate the Petri dish in an incubator to promote cell adhesion as per the incubation conditions (depend on type of cell patterned) mentioned in Table 2. Add PBS to the petri dish submerging the PDMS device.\nPeel the PDMS carefully off the petri dish with tweezers and wash the pattern with PBS. Add cell culture media to the Petri dish and place the cell culture in the incubator.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
