    "Urine collectionFirst-morning mid-stream-voided urine specimens are the most suitable for our method. Although spot mid-stream-voided urine is also likely usable, we have not verified such evidence.In catheter urine, WT1-positive cells are numerically diluted by mechanically detached urothelial cells.In the case of female samples, prior cleaning of the urethral meatus using saline soaked gauze balls before urine collection is preferable to prevent contamination by cells from the vulva. Additionally, samples collected during menstruation are not suitable for our method.Cytology specimen preparation (SurePathTM liquid-based cytology)The principle underlying the SurePathTM system is gravity sedimentation and electrical adhesion. In brief, the settling chamber is clamped to a positively charged slide, and the cell suspension is added. Gravity then settles the cells onto the slide, and the positively charged slide is combined with negatively charged cells (Figures 1 and 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180501/20180501233839_2285.jpgFigure 1.

Negatively charged cells sediment by gravity and electrically combine with positively charged slides. C. Excess cells are removed together with the supernatant. D. SurePathTM slides consist of a 13 mm circular monolayer smear.Stir the whole amount of urine with a medicine spoon to make it homogeneous.Distribute 10 ml of the homogeneous urine into a none-sterilized 15 ml conical test tube.Spin at 800 x g for 5 min in a swing-type centrifuge.Note: The centrifuge should be swing-type, not angle-type.Decant the supernatant with an aspirator or 5 ml pipette.Resuspend the sediment in 10 ml of CytoRich RedTM.Notes: In the case of macroscopic hematuria, collect and fix the buffy coat only after removal of the supernatant.",
    "The urine sediment needs to be fixed by CytoRich RedTM within 3 h after urine collection.Cells are stable for 3 days in CytoRich RedTM, they should not be stored longer than that.Fix the sample for at least 30 min.Centrifuge the specimens at 800 x g for 5 min and remove the supernatant.Add 6 ml of distilled water to the sediment and resuspend it for 10 sec with a vortex mixer.Centrifuge the specimen at 800 x g for 5 min and remove the supernatant.Add another 300 μl of distilled water to the sediment and resuspend it for 10 sec with a vortex mixer.After resuspension, transfer the entire amount of the specimen to a settling chamber and mount on a slide for 10 min.Invert the slide rack and discard the supernatant.Rinse the inside of the settling chamber with 95% ethanol.Note: Do not apply 95% ethanol directly to smears (Figure 3).Invert the slide rack and discard the 95% ethanol.Note: Take care not to dry the smear.Repeat once more Steps B13 and B14.Remove the settling chamber and immediately soak the slide in 95% ethanol.Notes: Immunostaining is carried out after fixation with 95% ethanol for 30 min or more.Cells are stable for 3 days in the 95% ethanol, they should not be stored longer than that. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180501/20180501234648_2533.jpgFigure 3. Schematic diagram of Step B13Immunocytochemistry (immunoenzyme staining)After fixing with 95% ethanol, incubate the slides in methanol containing 0.3% hydrogen peroxide to block endogenous enzyme activity (for 15 min).Notes:  Hydrogen peroxide solution needs to be prepared freshly each time.In any process, when moving the slides through the solutions, mix the solutions and slides adequately by dipping with the slide holder several times.Hydrate the slides in a series of ethanol solutions of decreasing concentration (70% ethanol, 50% ethanol, and distilled water, for 1 min each).",
    "Remove the slide and use Kimwipes to wipe away the distilled water surrounding the cell smear.Enclose the area around the smear with a PAP pen.Notes:  Use the PAP pen on the part wiped dry of the distilled water.Move to the next step only after the PAP pen line has dried (for 10-20 sec).Rinse the slide with PBS (2 times, for 1 min each time).Note: If stored at 4 °C, PBS can be used for several months.Incubate the cell smear with 100 µl of diluted (1:1,000) WT1 antibody in a humidified chamber (for 1 h at room temperature).Rinse the slide with PBS (3 times, for 1 min each time).Incubate the cell smear with 3 drops of N-Histofine Simple Stain MAX PO (MULTI) in a humidified chamber (for 30 min at room temperature).Rinse the slide with PBS (3 times, for 1 min each time).Incubate the cell smear with 100 µl of DAB reagent (for 1 min).Note: Prepare the DAB reagent immediately before use.Rinse the slide with distilled water (3 times, for 1 min each time).Counterstain the slide with Mayer’s hematoxylin (for 30 sec).Rinse the slide under running tap water (for 5 min).Dehydrate the slide with 100% ethanol (4 times, for 5 min each time).Move the slide from the ethanol into the xylene (4 times, for 5 min each time).Mount the coverslip onto the slide using mounting medium."
