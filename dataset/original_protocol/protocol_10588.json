    "1. Preparation of dsRNAi Constructs Used for the Down-regulation of ZmCCR1\nDesign gene specific primers including necessary restriction enzyme sites for making a dsRNAi construct to knock-out the ZmCCR1 gene. Two primer sets were designed to amplify two fragment segments of ZmCCR1 cDNA: a 523 bp fragment from nucleotide 748 to 1271, and a 285 bp fragment from nucleotide 986 to 1271. The ZmCCR1 cDNA was provided from the Arizona Genome Institute (AGI). More details are described in Figure 1.\nAmplify the large fragment by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the ZmCCR1 cDNA template using the primers ZmCCR1_748F_BglII (5’-AGATCTACATCCTCAAGTACCTGGAC-3’) and ZmCCR1_1271R_NcoI (5’-CCATGGTTTACACAGCAGGGGAAGGT-3’). Amplify the smaller fragment (285 bp) using the primers ZmCCR1_986F_BglII (5’-AGATCTGGAAGCAGCCGTACAAGTTC-3’) and a ZmCCR1_1271R_SacI (5’-GAGCTCTTTACACAGCAGGGGAAGGT-3’).\nIndividually ligate the fragments into pGEM-T Easy following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nPerform mini-prep plasmid DNA isolation from individual transformants, each containing the pGEM-T constructs using a commercial mini-prep plasmid kit.\nDigest both the pGEM-T::ZmCCR1 (523 bp) and ImpactVector (IV)-1.1 (cytoplasm expression vector) with both BglII and NcoI.\nLigate the large digested gel purified ZmCCR1 fragment (523 bp) into the digested gel purified IV-1.1.\nDigest the pGEM-T::ZmCCR1(285 bp ) and IV-1.1::ZmCCR1(523 bp) with both BglII and SacI in order to insert the small fragment into the IV-1.1::ZmCCR1(523 bp).\nLigate the small digested gel purified ZmCCR1 fragment (285 bp) into the digested gel purified IV-1.1::ZmCCR1(523 bp).\nClone both 523 bp and 285 bp fragments into IV-1.1 to make the ZmCCR1 RNAi construct, which has a 285 bp inverted repeat sequence with a 238 bp spacer in the middle of the inverted repeat fragments (see Figure 1).\nTransfer this construct into Escherichia coli (E. coli), grow them and perform a midi-prep size plasmid DNA isolation to obtain enough plasmid DNA for maize genetic transformation.\n2. Maize Genetic Transformation\nPreparation of Tungsten Particles",
    "Place 60 mg of tungsten beads (M10) in a 1.5 ml tube and wash with 1 ml of 70% ethanol by vortexing for 2 min. Incubate for 10 min at 23 °C then centrifuge at 18,894 x g for 2 min and discard the supernatant.\nWash 3x with 1 ml of 100% ethanol, centrifuging for 2 min and discarding supernatant. Add 1 ml of sterile 50% glycerol to bring the microparticle concentration to 60 mg/ml.\nPreparation of DNA for Bombardment\n\t\nPlace the 50 μl (3 mg) of tungsten beads prepared in 50% glycerol into a 1.5 ml tube. Add 5 μl (1 μg) of IV-1.1::ZmCCR1 RNAi plasmid DNA, 50 μl of 2.5 M CaCl2, and 20 μl of 0.1 M spermidine. Vortex briefly between each addition of the above reagents.\nVortex the tungsten bead-DNA mixture briefly and centrifuge at 18,894 x g for 30 sec. Pour off the supernatant and resuspend the pellets in 140 μl of 70% ethanol. Remove the liquid and discard. Add 140 μl of 100% ethanol. Remove the liquid and discard.\nAdd 48 μl of 100% ethanol. Use immediately or store on ice for up to 4 hr prior to bombardment.\nBombardment\n\t\nPlace a 3-5 cm diameter Hi-II embryogenic maize calli (provided from Maize transformation Center of Iowa State University) in the middle of 100 mm Petri dishes containing N6OSM media (as osmotium) at least 4 hr prior to the bombardment.\nPrepare the PSD-1000/He Particle Delivery device according to the manufacturer’s instructions32.\nSterilize chamber wall with 70% ethanol. Load sterile 650 psi rupture disk into sterile retaining cap. Spread 5-6 μl of the M10-DNA solution onto the surface of a macrocarrier, dry briefly. Load macrocarrier and stopping screen into microcarrier launch assembly.",
    "Place microcarrier launch assembly and maize calli in chamber at a selected distance from the stopping screen (L2 = 6 cm) and close door. Accelerate in a vacuum of 27 psi against a wire mesh screen.\nPress the fire button until rupture disk bursts and helium pressure gauge drops to zero. Release the fire button.\nIncubate the bombarded calli in a Petri dish containing N6OSM (osmotic medium) for 16 hr in the dark at 27 °C. Break the calli into about ten pieces and transfer to N6E (callus induction medium) in Petri dishes and incubate for 5 days in the dark at 27 °C.\nSelection\n\t\nAfter 5 days on N6E, transfer the calli onto N6S medium (selection media). Subculture all calli on selection medium every 30 days for 8-12 weeks without disturbing the calli structure.\nAfter about 8-10 weeks, white fast-growing sectors will grow out of the non-proliferating and partially necrotic mother calli. Excise the white fast-growing tissues and subculture them to fresh selection medium (N6S) and continue to incubate as above.\nRegeneration\n\t\nTransfer the white and fast growing embryonic calli onto regeneration medium and incubate as above for 1 week. Switch the regenerating embryogenic calli to a period of 16 hr daylight and 8 hr dark at 25-27 °C\nTransfer the regenerating shoots onto the rooting medium in a glass test tube after 3-4 weeks, continue to incubate as above. After substantial root development appears, wash roots carefully under water tap, then transplant the plantlets to 4” pots with soil. Cover the pots with plastic bags to keep moist. After 2 days make small holes the plastic bags. After 5-6 days remove the plastic bags. Continue to incubate as above for another 5-6 days.\nGreenhouse",
    "Transfer the seedlings into 18” pots with soil and maintain in full summer sunlight or greenhouse light. The initial regenerated plants are called T0 while the first seeds belong to the T1 generation.\n3. Histological Assay\nFix the maize leaf mid-ribs in 5 ml of 10% neutral buffered formalin.\nProcess and vacuum infiltrate with paraffin on a tissue processor using a tissue processor.\nEmbed the tissues in paraffin using a HistoCentre III embedding station.\nRemove the excess paraffin from the edges once blocks are cooled.\nSection sample at 4-5 μm with a microtome using a microtome.\nPlace sections on microscope slides and dry in a 56 °C incubator for 2-24 hr. Make sure sections are fully adhered to the slide.\nDeparaffinize sections in two changes of xylene for 5 min at 23 °C.\nHydrate slides through two changes of 100% ethanol for 2 min and two changes of 95% ethanol for 2 min at 23 °C.\nRinse the sections in running tap water for 2 min.\nStain with 0.05% toluidine blue O for 1-2 min and rinse briefly with ddH2O.\nPlace a coverslip on the samples with immersion oil and visualization with light microscopy.\nScanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)\n\t\nFix the cross-sectioned maize leaf mid-ribs in 4% glutaraldehyde and 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 1-2 hr.\nBriefly rinse the samples in the buffer, dehydrated them in an ethanol series (25%, 50%, 75%, and 95%) for 10-15 min at each gradation and 100% ethanol for 10 min, 3x.\nDry the dehydrated cross-sectioned maize leaf mid-ribs in a critical point dryer using liquid carbon dioxide as the transitional fluid.\nMount the dried samples on aluminum stubs using high vacuum carbon tabs",
    "Coat the maize leaf mid-ribs mounted on aluminum stubs with gold (approximately 20 nm thickness) in a sputter coater purged with argon gas.\nExamine the coated samples in a JEOL JSM-6400V (lanthanum hexaboride electron emitter) scanning electron microscope.\nDigital images were pictured using an analySIS Pro software (version 3.2).\n4. Klason Lignin Measurement\nMill the samples through a 2 mm screen.\nUse a moisture analyzer to determine the moisture content of each sample and record the value.\nWeigh out ~1.5 g of each sample and record the mass. Extract the samples using water for the first extraction, followed by ethanol for the second extraction using either an automated solvent extractor (3 cycles per extraction, ~14 min per cycle) or soxhlet apparatus (8 hr per extraction).  (Note: This step removes extractives that can condense during acid hydrolysis and interfere with accurate lignin measurement, increasing the apparent Klason lignin content.)\nDry the extracted samples at 45 °C overnight, then allow them to cool in the desiccator, and weigh again.\nSet an incubator to 30 °C.  Measure 0.3 g of each dry, extracted sample into screw-top high pressure tubes (triplicates per sample is recommended) and record the weights to the nearest 0.1 mg. Add 3 ml of 72% H2SO4 to each pressure tube.\nMix the sample using a glass or Teflon stir rod. Leave the stir rod in the tube until water is added following incubation.\nPlace vials in an incubator set to 30 °C and 150 rpm for 60 min. After 1 hr add 84 ml of deionized water to dilute the acid concentration to 4% and mix with the stir rod. Be careful not to leave large amounts of sample on the sides of the vial above the water line.",
    "Tightly seal the stoppers on all vials and place them into a metal rack or large beakers.  Autoclave at 121 °C using a liquid sterilization cycle for 1 hr.  Allow them to cool to room temperature before opening. \nPre-ash the filtering crucibles in a furnace at 575 °C for at least 4 hr. Allow crucibles to cool in a desiccator for at least an hour.\nVacuum filter the solution from each tube through a separate crucible, using a rubber adaptor to secure the crucible. Use deionized water to rinse any remaining particles from the tube.\nDry the lignin residue at 105 °C for a minimum of 4 hr. Record the weight of the dry crucible and residue.\nIf using a 575 °C, pre-fire the samples over a Bunsen burner until there is no smoke or ash and then place in the furnace for 24 hr, or if using a programmable furnace, do not pre-ash and use the following program:\nRamp from room temperature to 105 °C and hold for 12 min.\nRamp to 250 °C at 10 °C/min and hold for 30 min.\nRamp to 575 °C at 20 °C/min and hold for at least 180 min.\nRemove the crucibles from the furnace and cool in a desiccator. Weigh the crucible and ash.\nCalculate the acid insoluble residue using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51340/51340eq1.jpg\nMPRE = Mass of pre-extracted biomass\nMPOST = Mass of post-extracted biomass\nMVIAL = Mass of extracted biomass added to the vial\nMRESIDUE = Mass of crucible and lignin residue\nMASH = Mass of crucible and ash\nMC = Moisture content of pre-extracted biomass, total weight basis\n5. Carbohydrate Analysis",
    "Perform cell wall carbohydrate analyses based on the Foster et al. (2010) protocol31. In brief, Prepare alcohol insoluble residue from freeze dried plant material. Then hydrolyze the material with trifluoroacetic acid and match the solubilized monosaccharide derivatives to their corresponding alditol acetates. Analyze these volatile derivatives by gas chromatography (GC) connected to a quadruple mass spectrometer.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
