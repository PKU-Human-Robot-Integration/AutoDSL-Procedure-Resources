Synthesis of Alkyne-Phenol Probe (Compound 2)\nNote: All the procedures should be operated in a fume hood.\nSynthesis of compound 1\nWeigh 0.245 g of 4-pentynoic acid (2.5 mmol), 0.288 g N-hydroxysuccinimide (2.5 mmol) and 0.613 g of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDCI) hydrochloride (3.2 mmol) in a 50 mL round-bottom flask.\nAdd 20 mL anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) to the flask. Stir the solution at 25°C for 16 h.\nRemove the solvent using the rotary evaporator to obtain a yellow residue. Dilute the residue with 15 mL ethyl acetate and 5 mL water. Wash the combined organic layer with 5 mL dilute hydrochloric acid solution (pH ~ 4), water, and brine successively. Dry the organic layer with 2 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate for 10 min and filter to remove the sodium sulfate. Condense the organic layer using the rotary evaporator to obtain the crude product of compound 1.\nPurify the crude product by silica gel chromatography with 1% methanol in dichloromethane (DCM) to obtain 0.478 g of pure compound 1 (yield = 98%).\nPause Point: compound 1 could be stored at −20°C for at least 1 year.\nSynthesis of compound 2\nWeigh 0.24 g of compound 1 (1.23 mmol) and 0.342 g tyramine (2.5 mmol) in a 50 mL round-bottom flask.\nAdd 860 μL of trimethylamine (TEA, 6.2 mmol) and 15 mL anhydrous DMF to the flask.

    "Remove the solvent using the rotary evaporator to obtain a brown residue. Extract the product by 3 × 10 mL ethyl acetate. Wash the combined organic layer with 5 mL dilute hydrochloric acid solution (pH ~ 4), water, and brine successively. Dry the organic layer with 2 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate for 10 min and filter to remove the sodium sulfate. Condense the organic layer using the rotary evaporator to obtain the crude product of compound 2.\nPurify the crude product by silica gel chromatography with 2% methanol in DCM to obtain 0.216 g of pure compound 2 (yield = 81%).\nCharacterize compound 2 by 1H-NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization UPLC-MS. (See the Expected Outcome[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] section).\nCritical: Excess tyramine is necessary to drive conversion of compound 1 to compound 2 and to avoid the generate of N, O-disubstituted by-product.\nNote: The Alk-Ph probe is available from the Lead Contact upon request. (See the Materials Availability[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec8.2] section)\nExpression of APEX2 in Yeast\nTiming: 5 days\nThe following steps describe the expression of APEX2-fusion in transformed yeast cells.\nMix 0.1–0.5 μg plasmid DNA (in less than 2 μL volume) with 20 μL of competent cells. Add 200 μL EZ 3 solution (from the EZ frozen transformation kit, Zymo Research) to the mixture.\nIncubate at 30°C for 1.5 h. Mix the transformation solution vigorously by vortexing three times at 15 min intervals during the incubation.\nSpread the above transformation mixture on a SD plate. Incubate the plate at 30°C for 3 days to obtain transformant colonies.\nInoculate a single colony of transformants containing Su9-APEX2-eGFP plasmid from SD plates into 5 mL SD media. Grow the transformants at 30°C to mid-log phase for approximately 24 h.",
    "Measure the absorption of grown yeast cells in SD media at OD600. The absorbance was typically between 15 and 20. Dilute the cells to 100 mL SG media such that OD600 ~ 0.1. Grow the cells at 30°C for 8 h to OD600 ~ 1.0.\nNote: The volume of diluted SG media is dependent to the following experiments. Generally, 5 mL SG media are enough for western blotting analysis, 60 mL SG media is sufficient for proteomic analysis, and 30 mL SG media is adequate for RNA labeling.\nPause Point: After step 5. The transformed plates could be stored at 4°C for up to 1 month.\nAPEX Labeling and Click Reaction\nTiming: 10 h\nThe following steps describe the protocols of APEX2 labeling in living yeast cells and click reaction on protein level.\nPellet APEX-expressing cells from 60 mL SG media at 4,000 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant. Wash the pellet with 12 mL PBS twice.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 6 mL PBS buffer containing 2.5 mM Alk-Ph probe (See Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).

Please prepare more cells if need more contrasts, such as omit probe or omit H2O2.",
    "Note: For proteomic experiments, azide-(PEG)3-biotin reagent is conjugated for enrichment and western blotting analysis. For characterization by in-gel fluorescence cells from 5 mL SG media are sufficient and conjugation should be performed instead with azide-Cy5.\nPause Point: After step 15, precipitated protein sample could be stored in methanol at −80°C for a few days, which also facilitates more thorough precipitation.\nStreptavidin Blot and In-Gel Fluorescence Characterization of APEX2 Labeling\nTiming: 8 h\nThe following steps describe the protocol of western blotting or in-gel fluorescence characterization for characterization of APEX2 labeling.\nAdd 19 μL 5× protein loading buffer to the 75 μL protein sample mentioned in step 18 of APEX labeling and click reaction section and boil at 95°C for 10 min.

Add 25 μL 400 mM iodoacetamide and incubate at 30°C in dark for 30 min to block free sulfydryl.\nNote: Dithiothreitol is added to reduce the disulfide bond in native protein to free sulfydryl, which is subsequently alkylated with iodoacetamide. The alkylation is both uniform and irreversible, which facilitates downstream mass spectrometry data analysis.\nWash the beads twice with 1 mL triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (See Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) to remove excess small molecules.\nResuspend the beads in 200 μL triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer.

After cell lysis, centrifuge the sample at 12,000 × g for 5 min and keep the supernatant.\nExtract yeast RNA from supernatant using TRIzol™ Reagent according to manufactural instructions. For every 200 μL supernatant, add 1 mL TRIzol.
