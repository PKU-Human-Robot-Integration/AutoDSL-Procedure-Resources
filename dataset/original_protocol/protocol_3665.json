Maintain the animal under conditions of controlled temperature (22°C–24°C for standard laboratory temperature) and duration of light-dark cycle (12 h light cycle, lights on at 07:00 h) throughout all the studies.\nCritical: Pair-housing is important to maintain the wellbeing of the mouse as solitary housing can trigger other forms of social distress that can lead to changes in behaviour as well as in thermogenesis. It is possible to increase the number of mice per cage, however, it is important to make sure that all treatment groups are the same, as that may alter baseline food intake and energy metabolism (Nagy et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Bastias-Pérez et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). In addition, one needs to consider that with increasing numbers of mice the formation of social hierarchy will occur that can have influences on the basal stress levels of the individual mice. If larger numbers of mice per cage are used it is advisable to choose animals with similar bodyweight to minimize dominance and fighting, especially with male mice. We advise that when deciding on the number of mice to be placed into one cage the user should take into the consideration on pre-testing the animal’s social dominancy, especially when compared the phenotype between male and female (van Den Berg et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Williamson et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Karamihalev et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4])",
    "At the pre-monitoring week (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), measure body composition, glucose tolerance, and basal metabolic profiles following the subsequent steps.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/590-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic summary of the chronic stress paradigm\nA full 7 weeks protocol to establish a reliable chronic stress mouse model. ACC, acclimatization; Wk-BW, weekly body weight monitoring; DXA, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan; GTT, glucose tolerance test; P. analysis, post-analysis; FI, food intake monitoring.\nNote: Sophisticated monitoring systems might not be accessible for all laboratories. It is possible to limit the parameters to determine the randomised pre-grouping to body weight, glucose tolerance, and food intake.\nMonitoring of the establishment of social hierarchies during this phase is also advisable.\nBody composition monitoring on Monday\nTiming: [2 h / 8 mice]\nPerform body composition scan on Monday using either the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA; Lunar PIXImus2) or MRI (EchoMRI) at a designated time e.g., 14:00 – 16:00 h.\nObtain baseline data on lean mass (g), whole body fat mass (g), bone mineral content and bone mineral density (g/cm2).\nNote: We found that stress exposure of less than 4 weeks seldom lead to a change in bone metabolism, therefore fat mass and lean mass are the most critical data for the pre-grouping stage. However, longer stress exposure may also affect the bone phenotype, hence it is advice to obtain this data if the duration of the study is longer than 6 weeks (Baldock et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nGlucose tolerance test (GTT) on Tuesday\nTiming: [2 h / 8 mice]\nFast all mice at 9:00 h by removing foods from the hopper as well as change to new bedding to avoid the mice from feeding on spillages.",
    "At 14:00 h, use fresh injectable glucose at 50% strength (0.5 mg / 1 μL; Phebra), and then dilute it into 10% strength with saline ( 0.1 mg / 1 μL). Administer the 10% glucose aliquot at 10 μL per gram of body weight via intraperitoneal injection. For example, animal with a body weight of 25 g will be injected with 250 μL of the 10% glucose aliquot.\nThen measure tail-blood glucose level at 0, 15, 30, 60 and 90 min time interval by using the Accu-chek Go glucometer (Roche, Dee Why, Australia).\nIn between each interval, we suggest collecting additional 80 μL of blood at room temperature (RT) in order to examine the efficiency of insulin secretion in response to glucose challenge and the baseline by using the commercial assays for insulin (Merck Millipore)\nCritical: To avoid proteins in the serum from degrading it is important to spin down blood during each time interval immediately at 2000 × g RT for 5 min. 50 μL of serum can be extracted from about 80 μL of blood. Collecting higher volumes of blood is not recommended as this may exhaust the animal which will affect its metabolism and body weight.\nSnap freeze serum samples by placing them into liquid nitrogen and store them at −80°C until use.\nMetabolic profiling on Thursday\nTiming: [2 h / 8 mice]\nAcclimatize individual mice in each metabolic chamber (Sable systems international) for 24 h and then start the recording over 3 nights e.g., starting at 17:00 h on Friday until 10:00 h on Monday.",
    "To record the most reliable physiological and behavioral results only use data (energy expenditure, food intake, respiratory exchange ratio and physical activity) recorded from 09:00 h Saturday to 9:00 h Monday to allow the mice to be familiarized themselves with the new environment and all parameters have reach a stable baseline.\nCaution: After the single-house monitoring of their metabolic profiles it is possible that when they are being placed back to their home cage they may start to fight with each other. We suggest to provide them an extra dome to give additional space to each individual mouse as well as the user should ensure the animal holding room has no other large groups of female mouse being held in the room.\nChronic stress inducing period (4 weeks)\nOnce the mice are pre-grouped, start any feeding interventions under the stress condition depending on your interest of the diets, e.g., Chow diet, high sugar diet or high fat diet. We perform the following stress paradigm 3 times each week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 14:00 h – 15:00 h.\nCritical: To induce stress, use an empty cage with the same specifications as the home cage. Make sure that the cage of choice contains no side platform or edges the mice can rest on to avoid exposure to the stressor. It is also important to use a container or cage with a height above 18 cm to avoid that the mice can escape or getting injured from jumping onto the edges.\nCritical: It is important to close the lid immediately to avoid the mice from escaping, as stress exposure may induce acute hyper-activity.",
    "Pre-fill empty cage with 1-cm depth ice-supplemented water (200 g of ice in 100 mL of water). Does not need to be top up with ice throughout the stress exposure (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/590-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Stress exposure set up example\n(A) Pre-fill cage (27 cm × 10 cm × 18 cm) with ice supplemented water.\n(B) Mouse avoiding ice water by standing up.\n(C) Mouse behavior at 1 h after stress.\n(D) Dry fur at 1 h after stress.\n(E) Mouse dome used for home cage.\n(F) 2 domes used for 2 mice inside the same cage.\nPre-record body weight before the stress paradigm and then place each animal from the same cage gently into a separate stressor cage and monitor their activity for 1 h for the first exposure to stress to observe any extreme discomfort to the mice. Full hour monitoring will not be necessary at subsequent occasions if the mice did not show any heightened response at the first round.\nCritical: During the first stress exposure it is important to closely monitor the animal every 5 min, as the first time may trigger extreme hyperventilation and hyperactivity in some animals. If such situation happens, remove the animal immediately from the water and restart on the next round of stress. The tolerance of the mice in response to the cold water will gradually improve. Generally, 90% of animals react without any acute adverse effects to this method.",
    "Critical: Place each mouse gently to avoid the cold water from splashing onto their fur, as this may cause significant decrease in their body temperature. We prefer to only place one mouse into the stressor cage under dimension 27 cm × 10 cm × 18 cm to avoid the cage being overly crowded (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Also observe that at the end of the stress paradigm the fur of the mouse is dry (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nNote: We confirmed that the stress phenotype induced by this protocol is not due to the coldness of the water, as monitoring of the body temperature throughout the stress protocol compared to control conditions employing an infrared thermo-camera showed no significant difference between the groups (Ip et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3])\nWhile the stress paradigm is under way, change new bedding in all cages as well as pre-weigh food in each cage to allow the monitoring of food intake after stress exposure. Weigh food again before the next stress including the spillages on the bedding.\nPerform the same stress method 3 times a week with 1 day rest apart between each stress exposure for four weeks. At the end of the second week, perform progress monitoring for body composition and metabolic profiling again. (steps described in pre-monitoring and acclimatisation period).\nAt the end of the fourth weeks of stress exposure, perform again body composition, metabolic as well as GTT monitoring (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nAt the end of the experiment, there are two options to either examine activity changes in the brain or process brain and organs from the periphery for protein and/or transcriptome analysis.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1.

    "Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. Mouse under stress exposure after 1 h, related to step section “chronic stress inducing period” step 3\nOption 1: Post-stress analysis of neural activity (3 days)\nTo examine activity changes in the brain such increases in cFos after the chronic stress exposure, perfuse the animal by transcardial perfusion with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), extract and incubate the brain overnight with 4% PFA at 4°C followed by another day of incubation with 30% glucose at 4°C until the brain sinks to the bottom in the liquid. Remove all the glucose before freezing at −80°C. (To examine for transcriptional changes please refer to option 2 below. )\nNote: if perfusion is done in a separate experimental room, acclimatize the animal in the same room for at least 3 h to minimise non-specific activation of neuronal activity. Alternatively, the animal can be anesthetised in the same room and carry to the experimental room.\nPause Point: perfused brain can be kept at −80°C for up to 1 year. Longer than 1 year may lead to potential tissue damage due to dehydration.\nSection brain coronally at 30 μm and then perform immunofluorescence analysis by using a rabbit raised anti-cFos antibody (1:1200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Sections can also be stored in cryoprotectant at −20°C for later use.\nPause Point: Brain sections can be kept in cryoprotectant at −20°C for up to 6 months. We haven’t tested the time course beyond this point on section quality.\nTo perform the immunofluorescence step against neuronal markers such as cFos, the following “free-floating” protocol has been optimized by our laboratory.",
    "On the day of the experiment, pre-wash the stored sections 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] times at room temperature (RT) for 5 min in triton X-100 supplemented phosphate-buffered saline (PBST; 0.2% v/v) with gentle orbital shaking. This PBST buffer concentration will be used throughout the washing steps in this protocol.\nNext, prepare the citrate acid-based antigen retrieval reagent (mix 1.125 mL of 0.1 M citric acid, 5.125 mL 0.1 M tri-sodium citrate and 62.5 mL water together). Antigen retrieval step is performed in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube. 2 mL of the citrate buffer will be used for each brain containing approximately 20 sections of the 30 μm cut-brain slides.\nHeat the brain sections in a 60°C water bath for 5 min.\nNote: It is also better to pre-heat your citrate buffer before adding it to the brain sections to ensure the antigen retrieval step is performed at the most optimal condition.\nAfter the antigen retrieval step, wash the brain sections 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] times at RT with PBST buffer by removing the supernatant in the 2 mL Eppendorf tube with gentle orbital shaking.\nThen block sections in 2 mL of PBST supplemented with normal goat serum (5% v/v %) for 2 h at RT with gentle orbital shaking.\nRemove blocking buffer and then add 2 mL of the cFos antibody containing PBST buffer supplemented with bovine serum albumin (1:1000; Stock concentration at 1 mg/mL) into the section and incubate at 4°C overnight with gentle orbital shaking.",
    "Wash the brain sections 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] times at RT with 2 mL of PBST and then add Alexa 594 secondaries anti-rabbit antibody (Molecular probes) into the sections and incubate at RT for 1 h. Wash the brain sections again 3 times at RT with 2 mL of PBST. Finally, mount the sections with fluoroshield with DAPI (Sigma) onto the slides and visualize under fluorescence microscope (Leica).\nOption 2: Fresh tissue collection to examine body fat depots and organs (3 h for 8 mice)\nIn option 1 the procedure presents a limitation due to PFA fixation, which prevents the use of various peripheral tissues for other purposes. In order to examine precisely the mass of various organs, or to perform protein and transcriptome analysis on these organs as well as in the brain one can collect tissues freshly by following the subsequent steps.\nAfter stress exposure, cull mice at 14:00 h by cervical dislocation followed by decapitation and immediate serum collection using the method as described. Serum collected after cull can be used for the corticosterone assay to confirm the stress phenotype.\nCollect the brain immediately and rinse them quickly on phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). It is also possible to dissect out different parts of the brain in chilled dissection buffer (1× HBSS, 2.5 mM HEPES-KOH [pH 7.4], 35 mM Glucose, and 4 mM NaHCO3), in a 6 cm petric dish on ice, to allow for the study of gene expression changes in specific nucleus (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/590-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

To collect all the tissues without weighing 2. To focus only on a couple of tissues such as the brain and the fat depots. (The choice of interest varies depending on your project.)\nAfter collection the frozen tissues can be kept at −80°C for at least 2 years, however, we don’t have data to support the maximal time the tissues can be stored without degradation.
