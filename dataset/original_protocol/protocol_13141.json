Recruiting participants via available methods\nFollow the required respective institutional guidelines for disseminating study recruitment materials (flyers, posts, emails, calls, etc.) and approved recruitment methods.\n\tNOTE: The current study recruited via recruitment letter mailings to specific cohorts and follow-up phone calls to potential participants. The details regarding ordering the CES devices for the study are included in the supplemental CES device order instructions (Supplementary File 1).\nWhen someone expresses interest in study participation, screen them over the phone to ensure they meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\t\nInclude participants who fit the eligibility criteria: age 20-60 years old (limit set during preliminary study to minimize brain structural changes due to aging)31; diagnosis of fibromyalgia by the American College of Rheumatology 2016 criteria32; right-handedness (in order to provide consistency in brain structure and function); pain score of 4 or greater on the Defense and Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS)33 in the 3 months prior to enrollment; consistent and stable FM related medication for at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment34; and ability to safely tolerate MRI.",
    "For the fibromyalgia screening portion, fill out the new clinical fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria32 with the potential participant to obtain their widespread pain index (WPI) score and severity score (SS). Score according to the guidelines listed at the bottom of the page.\nFor the pain score screening portion, ask potential participants to verbally rate their average, consistent pain over the past 3 months on a scale from zero to ten.\nFor the MRI screening portion, complete an MRI safety screening form with the potential participant provided by an institution or the scanner facility itself.\nAsk participants about all possible exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria include a history of seizures or neurologic conditions that alter the brain; pregnancy; claustrophobia, MRI-incompatible implants, or other conditions incompatible with MRI; and a history of uncontrolled psychiatric illness or autoimmune disease that leads to pain and can better explain symptoms31.\n\t\t\nIf any of the exclusion criteria apply to them, they fail the screening. Do not include them in the study.\nWhen someone passes the screening, schedule them for their consent appointment and baseline MRI scan. Schedule 2 h for the consent and scan time.\n2. Administering baseline, mid, and post-participant study appointments (see Table 1)\nNOTE: All appointments take place at the MRI scanner location.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\n,Time,Research Activity\nPhase 1,Week 1,\"Recruitment, Screening, Enrollment\"\nPhase 2,Week 2–3,\"Baseline Assessments, rs-fcMRI\"\nPhase 3,Weeks 2–14,Intervention\nPhase 4,Week 6–10,\"Acute follow-up, rs-fcMRI (6 weeks into treatment)\"\nPhase 5,Week 12–16,\"Long-term follow-up, rs-fcMRI (12 weeks into treatment)\"\nTable 1: Research design. A timeline of the phases of individual participation over the 12 weeks of the study.\nBefore each baseline visit, prepare a CES device to bring to each participant.",
    "Open up the case to ensure the device is inside (it should be in bubble wrap). Remove the back of the device and insert two AAA batteries.\nReplace the device back. Turn the device on to ensure it works before bringing it to the participant. Hold down the top button for about 2 s until the screen lights up to turn it on, and hold it down for about 2 s until the screen goes blank to turn it off.\nEnsure each case contains the device, extra batteries, a lanyard, a small solution applicator, and ear clips. Make sure that the bag to give to participants contains the device case, a bottle of conducting solution, an extra cap to fill the small solution applicator, and extra ear clip electrode pads.\nOnce their consent and baseline MRI scan have been scheduled, meet the participant at the MRI scanner location for the appointment with two copies of the consent form, a CES device and its materials, eligibility testing paperwork, and a questionnaire packet for them to complete. Additionally, bring the data transfer device through which the MRI data will be transferred to the analysis site.\n\tNOTE: This study utilized an encrypted USB drive.\n\t\nFor the eligibility paperwork, include the new clinical fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria32 and the DVPRS33.\n\t\tNOTE: The DVPRS should be included for each visit.\nFor the physical function tests, include a form to record the results of each test20,21,35.",
    "For the questionnaires that participants will fill out, include the appropriate PROMIS measures (PROMIS Scale v1.2 - Global Health, Neuro-QOL Item Bank v2.0 - Cognition Function - Short Form, PROMIS Item Bank v1.0 - Substance Use/Alcohol: Alcohol Use, PROMIS Item Bank v1.0 - Emotional Distress - Anxiety- Short Form 7a, PROMIS Item Bank v1.0 - Emotional Distress-Depression - Short Form 4a, PROMIS Item Bank v1.0 - Fatigue - Short Form 6a, PROMIS Item Bank v1.0 - Pain Interference - Short Form 4a, PROMIS Item Bank v1.2 - Physical Function - Short Form 8b, PROMIS Item Bank v2.0 - Social Isolation - Short Form 4a)36.\nAt the MRI location, administer the baseline visit. Call the participant ahead of time to confirm.\n\t\nRead through the full consent form with the participant ensuring that they understand the information. Ask them if they would like to participate, and if they agree, have them print their name, sign, and date the form.\nAfter consenting, if the participant chooses to participate in the study, complete the inclusion testing paperwork with them. If they are eligible to continue, complete the steps below; if they are ineligible, terminate their study participation at this point.\n\t\t\nEnsure that the eligibility testing paperwork includes the new clinical fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria and the DVPRS.\nIf a participant is eligible after the inclusion testing, explain to the participant how to use the CES device.\n\t\t\nRemove the device from the case and show participants how to turn it on and off with the button at the top. Remind participants that the device will automatically deactivate after 60 min has elapsed.",
    "Show participants how to attach the ear clip cord to the side. The opposite end of the cord from the clips plugs into a small hole on the left side of the device labeled with a \"1\".\nDemonstrate how to remove the old electrode pads from the ear clips and attach new ones. To remove old pads, pull up the adhesive from where it connects to the clips. To attach new pads, align the hole in the spare electrode pads with the raised area in the center of the clip and press down firmly.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Do not pull the electrode pads by the soft portion on top. It is prone to tearing and will leave the adhesive stuck to the clips.\nDemonstrate how to clip the ear clips to their earlobes and have them try it once. Squeeze the green tips of the clip to open it, position the earlobe between, and gently close the clip to attach.\nShow them how to remove the plastic top from the small solution applicator and fill it with the solution from the larger bottle (see steps 2.3.3.6-2.3.3.8). Remind them that the solution is necessary for the device to function properly.\nTo remove the top of the small solution applicator, remove the cap and press firmly against the side of the tip. The plastic tip will dislodge from the rest of the bottle.\nAttach the alternate cap for filling the small applicator to the top of the larger solution bottle. Push up the small nozzle, slide it into the small applicator, and squeeze the large bottle to fill.\nTell participants that they should only add about 1-2 drops of the solution to each earclip electrode pad. Any excess solution should be dabbed off before use.",
    "Instruct the participants to use the device every day of the week for 60 min in the evening, about 1 h before going to bed. Instruct the participants to use the device while at rest (i.e., sitting still or lying down, not moving around).\n\t\t\tNOTE: For both time and position, participants were allowed normal variations in their home environment of usage to increase the practical nature of this therapy for home use. No parameters were set for sound allowed in the environment or required device storage.\nGive the participants a blank device log and explain that they need to enter each date of device use, their pain score before and after device use, and the time of device use.\nIf participants are not able to use their device for a period of time during the 6 weeks between appointments but are able to make the follow-up appointments, let them remain in the study. If they are not able to use the device or make it to the study visits, end their participation. See the supplemental CES device log (Supplementary File 2) for the device log this study used.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The following steps will be repeated during all three visits.\nAfter the device explanation, have the participant complete three short physical function tests23. For each test, a maximal number will be recorded for the score (total repetitions for the first two and strength per trial for the third).\n\t\tNOTE: The stopwatch used for this study was an Apple iPhone 12.\n\t\t\nAdminister the 30 s chair sit stand test. Follow steps 2.3.4.2-2.3.4.6.\nPlace a chair with its back against the wall of the testing room. Have the participant sit on the chair with their back against the chair back.",
    "Instruct the participant to rise to a full standing position and then sit all the way back down with their back against the chair back as many times as they can in 30 s.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If they tap the chair but do not fully put their weight back on it in a sitting position, the repetition does not count.\nTell the participants when to begin. Start the timer when they start moving.\nHave participants do arm curls with a dumbbell on each side for 30 s per side. Start with the right arm first and then move to the left.\nRecord the total number of curls per side. Use a 5 lb weight for women and an 8 lb weight for men. Ensure that the participants are seated for the arm curl test.\nHave participants do three grip strength trials with each arm on a dynamometer. Follow steps 2.3.4.8-2.3.4.11. Start with the right arm first and then move to the left.\nPlace the dynamometer in the participant's hand. They should be squeezing the grip at the bottom and not touching the dial at the top.\nTell participants to squeeze the dynamometer as hard as they can and then release. The needle on the dial will stop at the highest level of grip strength they displayed.\nRecord their grip strength results by writing down the number the needle reaches on the dial. Reset the dial between repetitions by twisting the small knob on the front of the dial face counterclockwise until the needle rests at zero.\nEnsure that the participants are seated for the handgrip test.",
    "NOTE: Between each series, participants receive about 15-20 s of rest as they shift equipment to their other hand. Between each test, participants will receive about 2 min of rest while the equipment and paperwork for the next is prepared.\nAfter the physical function tests, have participants complete the questionnaire packet with a pen. Check over the packet afterward to make sure they have answered all questions.\nAfter all review, testing, and questionnaires are completed, walk participants to the MRI scanner itself (for all MRI protocol information, see section 3). Review the screening form with the MRI technicians and ensure participants have removed all metal from their person.\n\t\t\nMake certain that the study team members have no metal on their persons.\nHelp MRI technicians get participants into the scanner comfortably. Administer the MRI scan protocol.\nInstruct the participants about safety procedures (test call button and speakers).\nRemind the participants not to move at all during the scan.\nRemind the participants of the total duration of the scan, which should be 60 min.\nWhen the scan has been completed, help the participants out of the scanner.\nAfter the scan, finish participants' baseline visit and schedule their mid-visit for 6 weeks later. Participants will have three study visits total, each 6 weeks apart. Push MRI data to the study’s secure servers for analysis.\nOn the scheduled day, administer the mid-visit following the steps of the baseline visit. Call participant ahead of time to confirm.\n\t\nAdminister the DVPRS. Have participants return their first completed device log and provide them with a second device log.\nPerform steps 2.3.4-2.3.6 (same as in the baseline visit).\nFinish participants' mid-visit and schedule their post-visit for 6 weeks later. Push MRI data to the study’s secure servers for analysis.",
    "On the scheduled day, administer the post-visit following the steps of the mid-visit. Call the participant ahead of time to confirm.\n\t\nAdminister the DVPRS. Have participants return their second completed device log.\nPerform steps 2.3.4-2.3.6 (same as in the baseline and mid-visits). No additional visit scheduling is needed for the last visit.\nIf any information is needed to compensate participants, prepare and request that information on this visit.\n\t\tNOTE: This study required their name and address to issue checks from the Atlanta VA for compensation.\nFinish participants' post-visit. Push MRI data to the study’s secure servers for analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: Throughout the study, be sure to call and check in with the participants between visits to ensure they are using the device, completing the device logs, and aware of when their next visit will be.\n3. Setting up MRI scan protocols\nFor the MRI scan protocol, acquire BOLD rs-fMRI on a 3T MRI scanner with a 32-channel phased array head coil using a gradient echoplanar imaging (EPI) sequence. Use the following MR parameters: FOV (Field of View)= 220 mm2; TR (Repetition Time)/TE (Echo Time) = 1500/25 ms, multiband-acceleration factor =3; flip angle = 50˚; 110 x 110 matrix size; slice thickness = 2 mm; GRAPPA factor = 2; Partial fourier of 6/8; 34 phase-encode reference lines, 72 interleaved axial slices covering the whole brain, roughly 350 scan volumes to yield 8 min of resting state fMRI data for stable estimation of connectivity networks.\nIn the protocol for the anatomical T1w magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE), set TR = 2530 ms, TE = 3 ms, flip angle = 7°, slice thickness = 0.8 mm, 1 mm phase resolution. The T1w acquisition lasts approximately 6 min.",
    "Acquire diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scans on a 3T MRI scanner with a 32-channel phased array head coil using a diffusion spectrum imaging scheme. Collect a total of 129 diffusion sampling directions with a maximum b-value of 3000 s/mm2, an in-plane resolution of 2x2 mm2, and a slice thickness of 2 mm.\nAcquire physiological data (cardiorespiratory data utilizing a respiratory monitor belt and pulse oximetry) simultaneously (time-locked) to the fMRI data.\nSecurely transfer the MRI data from the scanner location to a secure site for preprocessing and analysis. Convert DICOMS to NIFTIs to comply with BIDS formatting utilizing dc2bids v2.1.6.\nScrub the data of individual identifiers. Use a study subject number on all data wherever applicable. Conduct a quality check to ensure no anomalous artifacts, such as excessive motion, occurred in the data via MRIQC v21.0.0.\n4. Preprocessing and analyses\nOnce the MRI data from the study has been received, utilize two separate pipelines to analyze it: one to analyze the functional connectivity between participants and another to analyze white matter tractography.\nPreprocess subjects' structural T1w and rsfMRI data via fMRIPrep v20.2.5, including brain extraction, tissue segmentation, and normalization of the T1-weighted (T1w) images as well as reference volume estimation, head-motion estimation, slice timing correction, and registration to the T1w for the functional images. This process results in the T1w and rsfMRI data normalized into MNI152NLin2009cAsym space.\n\t\nUse the preprocessed MRI data in the functional connectivity analysis (CONN).\nSee the supplemental fMRIPrep Boilerplate document (Supplementary File 337-56). For further details, refer to the  link: https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/\nImport the preprocessed dataset into CONN Toolbox v22a for further processing.\n\tNOTE: CONN Toolbox updated from v21a to v22a during this study.",
    "In the setup phase, establish 2nd level covariates to define the study groups (TRUE vs. SHAM) for analysis later and ensure the quality of T1w and rsfMRI images. Smooth fMRI data via 8 mm Gaussian kernel.\nFollowing preprocessing, denoise the data to remove extraneous and physiological noise.\n\t\tNOTE: This study computed the first-level analysis but did not evaluate or use it as the researchers are not interested in single-subject results.\nChoose seeds/ROIs and subject covariates and set contrasts. Run a group-level seed-to-voxel analysis.\nOnce the setup, preprocessing, and denoising steps have been completed for the pipelines, set the cluster and voxel thresholds to view connectivity patterns.\nSee Supplementary Figure 1 and the supplemental CES CONN Instructions (Supplementary File 4) document.\nUse correlational tractography57 to determine longitudinal changes in white matter integrity correlated with the experiment group to identify tract bundles and regions associated with the CES treatment. Below are the main analysis steps:\n\t\nConvert the raw DWI images from .dcm (DICOM) into .nii.gz (NIfTI) format.\nPre-process the images to correct for susceptibility-induced distortions using FSL's (version 6.0.6) TOPUP58,59 and for eddy current distortions using FSL's EDDY tool60.\nGenerate DWI image quality control (QC) metrics related to motion at the single subject and study-wise levels using FSL's EDDY QC tools.\nRun a two-way repeated measures ANOVA on these QC metrics to identify any between-group variance that may confound group tractography results. If a metric shows a between-group variance that is significant (p > 0.05), then it should be accounted for as a covariate in the correlational tractography analysis.\nImport the preprocessed data into DSI Studio (version \"Chen\" Nov 21 2022) where they are converted to .src (source) files. For more information regarding DSI Studio, refer to the software's website (https://dsi-studio.labsolver.org).",
    "Reconstruct the imported diffusion data using Q-Space Diffeomorphic Reconstruction (QSDR)61 to determine the white matter fiber orientations in MNI template space. A .fib (fiber orientation) file is output for each image. The option selections for the reconstruction are:\n\t\tmethod (reconstruction method selection) - QSDR\n\t\tparam0 (diffusion sampling length) - 1.25 (this is the default)\n\t\ttemplate (which template space to reconstruct data to) - ICBM152\n\t\talign_acpc (whether to rotate the image volume to align ac-pc) - 0 (false)\nCreate a connectometry database from these .fib files, which extracts the quantitative anisotropy (QA) values from the reconstructed diffusion data. Calculate the longitudinal change in QA for each subject in the database. Add demographics such as experiment group, age, sex, along with any covariates identified in the QC step via a .csv file to the database.\nNext, load the connectometry database into the Group Connectometry Analysis GUI.\nSelect covariates to be considered in the analysis. One of these selected covariates is designated as the Study variable.\n\t\t\nFor this analysis, select Group as the study variable. Tracts with longitudinal changes in QA correlated with Group will be identified while the effect of the other covariates selected will be regressed out.\nThe option selections for the group connectometry analysis are:\n\t\t\t- FDR Control (False Discovery Rate cutoff, only tracts with a significant correlation below FDR will be output) - 0.05\n\t\t\t- Length Threshold (value in voxels of minimum tract length used as null hypothesis) - 20 voxels (or 40 mm for 2 mm voxel sizes)\n\t\t\t- T threshold (t-stat measurement threshold for correlation effect) - 2.5\n\t\t\t- Study region (this pane allows regions to be included/excluded from the analysis) - select Whole Brain with - Exclude Cerebellum checked",
    "NOTE: For this study, the cerebellum was excluded due to some of the diffusion scans having portions of the cerebellum cut off during acquisition.\nPress the Run Connectometry button to perform the analysis, which outputs several files:\n\t\t- A .fib file that stores the t-stats and can be opened in DSI studio to visualize the t-stats of tracts with increasing QA (stored as \"inc_t\") or decreasing QA (stored as \"dec_t\"), which correlate with Group.\n\t\t- A .fdr_dist.values.txt, which lists the FDR values with respect to tract length\n\t\t- A .inc.tt.gz which is a tractography file that stores the tracts with increased longitudinal QA correlated with the study variable. (Group in our case). A .dec.tt.gz file stores the tracts with decreased longitudinal QA correlated with the study variable.\n\t\t- A .report.html file which conveniently reports the connectometry results along with imbedded tract plots, pictures, as well as the boilerplate information on the correlational tractography analysis steps for publication.\n\t\tNOTE: To see examples of the R code used for this study, see the supplemental CES R Code Plots (Supplementary File 5) and the supplemental R Code CES eddy-qc Anova files (Supplementary File 6).\nSubscription Required.
