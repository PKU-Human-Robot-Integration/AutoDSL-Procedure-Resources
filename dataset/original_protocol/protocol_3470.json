    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nNeuronal enrichment\nTiming: 1.5 h\nAfter neuronal differentiation, non-neuronal cells (glia and undifferentiated neural progenitor cells) need to be depleted. This is done by negative selection using specific antibodies that recognize markers of non-neuronal cells (CD44 recognizes glial cells and neural stem cells, and CD184 recognizes neural stem cells) in magnetic-assisted cell sorting (MACS). This method is gentler than fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) for cell enrichment since it uses gravity-based flow through a magnetic cartridge where cells bound to the antibody are trapped.\nIn this protocol, neurons are differentiated from iPSC-derived neuronal progenitor cells for 3 weeks using a dual-SMAD inhibition method (Tomishima, 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]), enriched following the protocol below, and re-seeded for 1 more week in neuronal differentiation media for a total of 4 weeks of differentiation. For details of the differentiation protocol please refer to the original paper (Rodrigues et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nNote: before you start, cool the centrifuge to 4°C and cool a PBS+0.5% BSA (PBS+BSA) solution in ice. Place an ice bucket and tubes in the biosafety cabinet (BSC) to pre-chill the tubes. All centrifugation steps are done at 300 × g and 4°C. See protocol for centrifugation times. The tubes containing cells should be kept in ice at all times between steps unless stated differently. PBS+BSA solution should always be used ice-cold.\nBefore resuspending the cells from centrifugations, it is important to “break” the cell pellets by flicking the tubes with your fingers. This step makes cell resuspension easier, gentler, and faster.\nVolumes below are recommended for cells growing in 10 cm dishes. Adjust volumes for other culture formats accordingly.\nLift cells from culture plates using Accutase.",
    "Wash the cells with 5 mL of PBS at 20°C–22°C once and add 3 mL of Accutase. Incubate for 10 min at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nDuring incubation, pre-wet the cell strainer (100 μm) with the ice-cold PBS+BSA solution. This can be done by placing the cell strainer onto a 50 mL plastic tube (Falcon tube) and pipetting 500 μL of the solution into the reservoir. Discard the tube and effluent.\nAfter the Accutase incubation, add 7 mL of the ice-cold PBS+BSA solution to the cells, transfer the content to an ice-cold 15 mL tube and pipette the cell suspension up and down multiple times until complete cell dissociation. It is important to keep the tube in ice while you pipette.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 10 min to wash the cells.\nResuspend the cell pellet by adding 10 mL of ice-cold PBS+BSA solution and pipette up and down until complete cell dissociation.\nPlace the moistened cell strainer on a new 50 mL tube and pipette the cell suspension. Allow cells to flow through. Determine the total cell number and concentration.\nCell labeling\nOnce determined the cell counts, centrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 40 μL of the PBS+BSA solution per 107 cells.\nAdjust the volumes accordingly if you have more or less cells.\nThe high cell density at this step is important for the success of the protocol, therefore it is key to flick the tubes and break the cell pellets before resuspending the cells, especially when you will be using micropipettes to resuspend cells.\nAdd 20 μL of the FcR Blocking Reagent and Biotin-conjugated CD44 and CD184 antibodies per 107 cells.",
    "The final incubation volume per 107 cells will be 100 μL (40 μL cells + PBS+BSA, 20 μL of FcR Blocking Reagent, and 20 μL of each Biotin-conjugated CD44 and CD184 antibodies). Therefore, the dilution factor for each antibody is 1:5.\nAdjust the volumes accordingly if you have more or less cells while maintaining the antibody dilution factor to 1:5.\nMix well and incubate the antibody and cell suspension for 15 min in the refrigerator at 4°C.\nAs per manufacture’s recommendations and to increase antibody’s binding specificity, it is important that this incubation be carried in the refrigerator instead of ice.\nWash the cells twice to remove unbound antibodies by adding 5 mL of PBS+BSA solution and centrifuge for 5 min.\nAdd 5 mL of cold PBS+BSA and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant, flick the tubes to break the cell pellets and repeat this step for a second wash.\nAt the end of the second wash, resuspend the cells in 60 μL of PBS+BSA solution per 107 cells.\nAdd 20 μL of the streptavidin magnetic MicroBeads per 107 cells. Mix well and incubate for 15 min in the refrigerator at 4°C.\nMix well the MicroBeads solution flask before adding to the cell suspension.\nWash the cells twice to remove unbound MicroBeads by adding 5 mL of PBS+BSA solution and centrifuge for 5 min.\nAdd 5 mL of cold PBS+BSA and centrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant, flick the tubes to break the cell pellets and repeat this step for a second wash.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells (now attached to the MicroBeads) in 500 μL of PBS+BSA solution per 107 cells. Keep cells in ice.\nThe cell suspension should be brownish.",
    "Magnetic separation – This step should be performed at 20°C–22°C\nPlace the Large cell column in the magnetic holder (MACS MultiStand) inside the BSC. Align a 15 mL tube under the column to collect the flow through.\nThe OctoMACS separator allows use of 8 magnetic columns at the same time. Alternatively, the MiniMACS separator can be used if only one sample is processed at one given time.\nUse 1 Large cell column per 2 × 107 cells (in 500 μL – from step 2.i.). Do not add more than this number of cells otherwise the column can clog. If you have more cells, split the separation across multiple Large cell columns.\nPre-wet the column by adding 500 μL of PBS+BSA solution. Let the solution run by gravity and discard the collector tube.\nApply 500 μL of the cell suspension (containing 2 × 107 cells) onto the column and let the suspension run by gravity. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nThe flow through contains the neuronal fraction.\nWash the column by adding 500 μL of the PBS+BSA solution three times to collect unbound neurons still on the column.\nThe final flow through volume containing the neurons should be of approximately 2 mL (500 μL of cell suspension plus 1.5 mL of PBS+BSA buffer).\nCollect the flow through fractions (combine the multiple fractions from the same sample in case you split in multiple columns) and determine the cell concentration.\nCentrifuge the flow through and resuspend the cells in neuronal media.\nSeed the neurons on pre-coated plates at high cell densities to increase survival. The optimal density needs to be determined empirically for each neuronal line.\nFor detail on pre-coating the plates before seeding the neurons, please refer to the original paper (Rodrigues et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).",
    "Note: while we prefer to use Accutase for cell detachment as it is more efficient, gentler, and does not require an inhibition step, other enzymes (e.g., Trypsin) can also be used in place. However, proper optimization of the detachment step and its suitability in the context of this protocol (e.g., preservation of surface epitopes for antibody binding) is recommended.\nNote: the neuronal yield at the end of the enrichment protocol depends on the proportion of neurons versus other non-neuronal cells at the beginning of the protocol. In our laboratory, we typically yield 30 to 50% neurons from the total number of cells at the beginning of the protocol.\nCell transduction\nTiming: 3–4 days\nAfter enrichment, neurons should be transduced with the lentivirus containing the GFP-RPL10a cassette. Lentivirus production and transduction detailed protocols have been published previously (Hotta et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Rodrigues et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13])\nCritical: lentiviral preparations should be handled with extreme caution. Please follow your institution’s biosafety recommendations.\nTwo days after enrichment (3 weeks plus 2 days of differentiation), change the media to new neuronal media (see neuronal media formulation in the Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) excluding the growth factors (BDNF, cAMP, GDNF and IGF1).\nAdd the lentivirus preparation at the end of the day.\nThe next day in the morning change the media to new regular neuronal media (containing growth factors) and let the neurons differentiate for 4 more days to complete 4 weeks of differentiation. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]\nNote: It is highly recommended that the cells used in the different experimental conditions are transduced with lentivirus produced in the same batch and with the same multiplicity of infection (MOI). We find that for iPSC-derived neurons, MOI ranges from 2 to 4 work well.",
    "Note: The GFP-RPL10a fusion protein will show a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution, but some concentration can be observed at the nucleolus as it is the site for ribosomal biogenesis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nLysate preparation\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/357-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Example of neuronal culture at 4 weeks of differentiation after transduction with the RPL10a-GFP transgene\nOn the left, immunofluorescence signal in orange shows MAP2 as a marker of neuronal cells and on the right signal in green shows GFP to track the RPL10a-GFP fusion protein. Note the fusion protein shows a diffused distribution in the cytoplasm and concentrated nucleolus foci (yellow arrowheads). Scale bar, 10 μm.\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThe steps below describe the TRAP protocol (Heiman et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) optimized for in vitro-derived neuronal cells. A minimal number of 2 × 107 neurons is recommended.\nCritical: An important aspect of the protocol is the stabilization of the polysome complex to avoid ribosomal run-off. This is important in order to collect ribosome-bound RNAs and accurately reflect the translational state of the cell type of interest. This will not affect the quality of the RNAs collected for the input samples. In this protocol, polysomes are stabilized by a pre-treatment of the cells with cycloheximide (CHX) for 10 min and by the presence of magnesium in the lysis buffer. Another important factor to avoid ribosome run-off in to keep the cells and lysate in ice or at 4°C at all times. Preferably, cell washes, lysis, and incubations should be carried in a cold room using pre-chilled pipets.",
    "It is worth considering that the use of CHX, a protein synthesis inhibitor, can have adverse effects to the cell’s biology and caution should be taken when planning and drawing conclusions from TRAP-seq experiments. For example, CHX treatment for longer than 2 h is known to inhibit Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD), which can affect abundance of NMD-targeted mRNAs, particularly mRNAs bearing long 3ʹUTRs. While we do not expect this effect to have a major impact in the TRAP-seq protocol, given that cells are treated with CHX for only 10 min, changes in mRNA abundance across experimental conditions should be observed and validated in the absence of CHX.\nCritical: Make all efforts to maintain RNase-free technique throughout the protocol. This involves thorough decontamination of surfaces and equipment with RNase decontamination reagents such as RNase-Zap (Sigma). We typically use a home-made RNase decontamination reagent containing 0.1 M NaOH and 0.1% SDS in RNase-free water. Use RNase-free certified plasticware and reagents, and aerosol-resistant tips. Gloves should be changed frequently. Keeping samples in ice or at 4°C will also help in minimizing RNase activity.\nCritical: Make sure all reagents, including the affinity matrix (see above), are ready and ice-cold before used. All steps below should preferably be performed in the cold room using pre-chilled pipets and carried as quickly as possible.\nAdd 100 μg/mL of CHX to the cells in culture media and return plates to the incubator for 10 min.\nWash the cells 3× with 10 mL of ice-cold PBS containing 100 μg/mL of CHX.\nKeep the plates on ice, and aspirate as much PBS as possible after each wash.\nCollect all CHX waste for proper disposal. Follow your institution guidelines.\nAdd 1 mL of the ice-cold cell lysis buffer per 10 cm dish and incubate the plate on ice for 10 min.",
    "Scrape the cells and cellular debris from the plates using a pre-chilled cell scraper, and transfer to a pre-chilled 1.5 mL tube.\nHomogenize the sample on ice by passing through pre-chilled 23- then 25-gauge needles 10× each. Avoid introducing bubbles to the lysate.\nAt this point, separate 10% of the lysate for RNA-seq, this will be the input sample. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAdd the input lysate sample to a separate 1.5 mL tube and keep in the refrigerator set for 4°C. The total RNA from input and IP samples will be purified together to ensure that both samples are incubated for the same duration.\nCentrifuge the remainder 90% lysate at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new pre-chilled tube and add 1/9 volume of DHPC 300 mM (reconstituted in water).\nFor example, add 100 μL for a 900 μL sample. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nMix the sample by inverting the tube and incubate in ice for 5 min.\nCentrifuge the sample at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C, and transfer the supernatants to new pre-chilled tubes and proceed to IP.\nImmunoprecipitation and RNA purification\nTiming: 2 h\nCritical: if possible, this step should also be carried out in the cold room. Use pre-chilled solutions, tips, and magnetic rack.\nGently resuspend the pre-made affinity matrix and add 200 μL to each supernatant sample (from step 16).\nMake sure the affinity matrix is thoroughly resuspended by pipetting up and down before use.\nIncubate samples at 4°C for 1 h with end-over-end rotation.\nSpin the tubes briefly for up to 5 s at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge at 4°C to collect beads from the cap of the tubes.\nCollect the beads using the magnetic rack.",
    "Add 1 mL of high-salt polysome buffer wash buffer to the beads.\nCritical: Do not mix the sample by pipetting up and down as you may lose beads attached to the pipet tip. Instead, to wash the beads put the tube in the rack and after the beads are collected on the magnetic side quickly invert the tube 180° and put it back in the magnetic rack.\nThis step washes out the beads as they go through the column of buffer, is gentler to the coated- beads and avoids introduction of bubbles. Do this step 3× for each wash.\nRepeat the wash steps for a total of 4× using 1 mL of high-salt polysome wash buffer.\nAfter the fourth wash, remove all remaining wash buffer, remove the tubes from the magnetic rack and bring the samples to 20°C–22°C. At this stage, remove the input RNA samples from refrigerator and bring these samples to 20°C–22°C as well. IP and input samples are to be processed in the same way from here on.\nTo extract RNA from the IP sample, resuspend the beads in 100 μL of Nanoprep lysis buffer with β-mercaptoethanol by vortexing. Collect the beads from the cap of the tube by brief centrifugation. For the input sample, simply add 100 μL of Nanoprep lysis buffer with β- mercaptoethanol and vortex.\nNote: The lysis buffer will be diluted to 0.5× in the input samples. In our experience, this does not lead to detrimental effects on the yields or quality of the recovered RNAs. Please see note below on alternative RNA extraction kits.\nIncubate the samples for 10 min at 20°C–22°C.\nFor the IP sample, separate the RNA from the beads using the magnetic rack (equilibrated to 20°C–22°C), and transfer the supernatant to a new tube.",
    "Proceed to RNA extraction and clean-up of the IP and input samples following the Nanoprep kit instructions. Make sure to perform the optional in-column DNase digestion step.\nQuantify the RNA samples using fluorescent-based methods (using Qubit for example). Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: We typically recover from 200 to 800 ng of RNA from the IP samples (90% of lysate) and 100 to 300 ng of RNA from the input samples (10% of lysate), when starting with 2 × 107 neurons.\nAssay the integrity of the RNA on a Bioanalyzer 2100 using an RNA Pico/Nano chip. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nOptional: Other RNA purification kits can be used. Only make sure that the lysis buffer of the alternative kit contains guanidine thiocyanate to release the RNA from the affinity matrix.\nPause Point: Purified RNA samples can be kept frozen in the RNA elution buffer at −80°C for several years.\nNote: IP and input samples need to be ribosome-depleted before sequencing. Use standard methods for library preparation and sequencing.\nNote: We use the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep kit for sequencing library preps. But we recognize that other sequencing library prep kits designed for total RNA can be used. Just be sure to include a ribosomal depletion step.\nThe sample with the least concentration is used to calibrate the amount of RNA used for all other samples. We have had success sequencing samples with as low as 200 ng of RNA. It is not necessary to match RNA amounts between IP and input samples, but libraries for IP and input samples across different experimental conditions should be made with the same amount of RNA. Additionally, all libraries should be made and sequenced together to avoid introduction of sequencing batch effects.\nComputational analysis: estimate of ribosomal engagement from sequencing data\nTiming: <1 week",
    "The steps below describe the computational analyses to be carried out after sequencing is completed. Raw read files from the TRAP-seq (ribosome-engaged RNAs) and RNA-seq (input) are processed to provide estimations of the ratios of ribosome-engaged RNAs at the gene level per cell type, genotype, or condition. Ratios can then be compared across experimental samples to offer an estimate of changes in ribosome engagement or translation regulation.\nNote: All code required for computational analysis are available at github: (https://github.com/JellisLab/translatome-neurodevo[href=https://github.com/JellisLab/translatome-neurodevo]).\nEstimate gene abundance based on transcripts quantified using Salmon program.\nDownload the RNA sequencing data and perform preliminary quality control of reads using FASTQC.\nDownload the most recent version of transcript sequences from Ensembl in FASTA format.\nAt this point, you can choose to use mRNA or lncRNA sequences from Ensembl\nBuild an index for the obtained transcriptome.\nQuantify each transcript abundance using the index and RNA sequencing data.\nSum estimated number of reads for all isoforms of the same gene to obtain the abundance at the gene level. We refer to this number as raw counts.\nNote: Further steps can be performed for quantifications of mRNA at the isoform level. For example, quantification of 3ʹUTRs can be done with sequences constructed for refined annotations of polyadenylation sites using the QAPA method described by Ha et al. (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\nCheck the quality of quantified samples.\nTransform raw counts with variance stabilizing transformation using DESeq2.\nCalculate pairwise Pearson’s correlation and plot the principal component analysis (PCA).\nReplicates of the same cell type and condition generally cluster together and have higher correlations.\nEstimate ribosomal engagement.\nNormalize raw counts for the same cell type and condition for both assays (TRAP and input) using DESeq2 size factors. All biological replicates should be included for the estimation of size factors.",
    "Estimate ribosomal engagement as a ratio between TRAP and input DESeq2 normalized counts for each biological replicate separately. Match biological replicates of parallel TRAP and input generated from the same lysate to minimize batch effects.\nNote: Below, the meaning of ribosomal engagement estimated as a ratio of TRAP and input counts is provided.\nConsider the connection between sequencing counts and number of mRNA molecules for TRAP and input samples for gene X:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/357-Si1.jpg (Equation 1)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/357-Si2.jpg (Equation 2)\nWhere L is the total number of counts in the sequencing library, βX is the fraction of mRNA molecules for gene X bound by ribosomes, RX is the number of mRNA molecules for gene X before immunoprecipitation of GFP-tagged ribosomes, and lX and lR stand for the length of gene X and the length of a read. The fraction on the right-hand side represents the fraction of total number of counts from L that correspond to gene X. The sum in the denominator is taken over all genes.\nNow, we can estimate RE:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/357-Si3.jpg (Equation 3)\nUltimately, we aim to estimate the fraction of mRNAs bound by ribosomes βX. The scaling factor f common between genes does not affect comparisons within the cell\nNote: The scaling factor f masks any global differences in βX between cell types A and B. We define global shift as a change in medians of βX. However, the scaling factor f can be eliminated using a reference gene (Equation 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd4]). Then, a shift in βX for a reference gene, determined with an alternative technique, for example with polysome profiling, can in principle be used to measure global shifts in fraction of mRNAs bound by ribosomes imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/357-Si4.jpg (Equation 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fd5]). Usage of multiple reference genes is desirable to overcome noise in measurements.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/357-Si5.jpg (Equation 4)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/357-Si6.jpg (Equation 5)",
    "Critical: Raw estimated ribosomal engagement can have variation in the range of values between replicates. It increases noise in the estimate of the mean RE and skews the comparison of RE between cell types. Since this variation preserves the order of genes, based on high spearman correlation between biological replicates, we propose to eliminate scaling bias using quantile normalization (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/357-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Example of ribosomal engagements values and the effect of quantile normalization\nOn the left, boxplot shows ribosomal engagement for the biological replicates of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and neural progenitor cells (NPC) before (top row) and after quantile normalization (bottom row). On the right, the scatterplot compares ribosomal engagement of genes between iPSC and NPC before and after quantile normalization.\nCorrect ribosomal engagement to remove scaling bias.\nAdjust ranges of ribosomal engagement of all biological replicates and cell types together using the quantile normalization technique. Match all quantiles between the samples.\nNote: If scaling bias is absent, then the interaction term approach in DESeq2 (design= ~ assay + celltype + assay:celltype) to estimate log2 fold-changes in ribosomal engagement between cell types is sufficient and desirable. However, if scaling bias is present, DESeq2 estimated log2 fold-changes are skewed. Therefore, we propose to estimate the significance of ribosomal engagement shifts with Z- score approach.\nEstimate significance of shifts in ribosomal engagement between cell types and conditions\nCalculate the mean and standard error of quantile normalized ribosomal engagement from biological replicates.\nEstimate Z-score using mean and standard error.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/357-Si7.jpg (Equation 6)\nWhere imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/357-Si8.jpg is an estimate of a mean and imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/357-Si9.jpg is an estimate of a standard error of a ribosomal enrichment for some gene in cell type A. Both statistics are estimated from biological replicates."
