In Guzikowski and Kavalali (2022)1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] this treatment scheme was used to understand how pharmacological manipulation with parental Artemisinin and its’ the two semisynthetic derivatives (Artemether and Artesunate) disrupts GABAergic synapse nano-organization. Therefore, the first section of this protocol is to treat cells with the Artemisinins. All three Artemisinins were used as their orientation in the Gephyrin (GephE domain) universal receptor binding pocket is different.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] An acute 1-h treatment was used to rapidly probe the functional and structural effects of distributed GABAAR-gephyrin binding however treatment length can be extended.\nThe day of experiments prepare working solutions of 10 mM Artemisinin, Artemether, and Artesunate.\nTreat primary hippocampal cultures with 50 μM of Artemether, Artemisinin, and Artesunate for 1 h by directly adding Artemisinins to growth media. Treat control samples with the equivalent volume of DMSO.\nRecommended to have volume of DMSO < 1% of total volume.\nNote: Immediately move to step 3 following 1 h incubation to begin fixation.\nNote: The above culturing and Artemisinins treatment protocol can also be used for electrophysiology whole cell voltage and current clamp recordings. It is important to also include Artemisinins in bath solution while recording.\n3-color immunocytochemistry\nTiming: ∼1.5 days\nThis section explains the steps to stain primary hippocampal cultures with desired primary and secondary antibodies to visualize protein location within the neuron. In Guzikowski and Kavalali (2022)1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] the main protein of interest was post-synaptic protein, gephyrin. In addition to gephyrin staining vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT) was stained for as a pre-synaptic marker and Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) as a dendritic marker.\nDay 1.",
    "Remove growth media from cell culture MatTek dishes and immediately replace with 4% PFA solution for 20 min at room temperature (RT) (20°C–22°C). Following fixation wash cells 3 × 5 min with PBS 1×.\nRemove PBS and permeabilize with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min at RT (20°C–22°C). Following permeabilization wash cells 3 × 5 min with PBS 1×.\nBlock with 1% BSA and 2% normal goat serum diluted in PBS for 2 h at RT (20°C–22°C).\nPrepare primary antibodies in blocking buffer.\nPrepare 120 μL of antibody solution per coverslip (optimize antibody solution volume depending on coverslip diameter, just need to cover). To investigate gephyrin, stain inhibitory presynaptic marker, vesicular GABA transporter (vGAT) (1:500), inhibitory postsynaptic scaffold protein gephyrin (1:150) and dendritic marker MAP2 (1:1000) (Refer to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for antibody dilution and concentration information).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2453_12.csv\nManufactures instructions were followed for all antibody dilutions.\nIncubate cells in primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer overnight (15–20 h) at 4°C. Place dishes into a humid chamber for incubation to ensure primary antibody does not evaporate.\nNote: Humid chambers can be made simply from supplies around the lab – an empty tip box padded with a layer of moist tissues will ensure the primary antibody solution does not evaporate during overnight incubation inside the tip box.\nNote: For optimization of primary antibody concentration start at a 1:500 dilution or concentration recommended by the supplier (Refer to troubleshooting problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]). In tissue increasing staining incubation length can increase antibody penetrance however for staining in cell culture, concentration should initially be adjusted before incubation length.\nNote: Always vortex and spin down antibodies before use.\nDay 2.\nWash cells 3 × 5 min with PBS 1×.\nPrepare secondary antibodies in blocking buffer.",
    "Prepare 120 μL of antibody solution per coverslip (optimize antibody solution volume depending on coverslip diameter, just need to cover). To tag the primary antibodies listed above use AF647 (1:350), AF568 (1:1000), and AF488 (1:500). Gephyrin is the primary protein of interest and was therefore tagged with the AF647 antibody and vGAT with AF568.\nNote: AF647 is an excellent fluorophore for dSTORM as it is extremely bright (high photon yield per switching event) and has a low on-off duty cycle. Therefore, if performing single color dSTORM, AF647 should be used. The quality of super resolution images is directly dependent on the photo-switchable probe’s photon number, duty cycle, survival fraction, and the number of switching cycles,5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] therefore the selection of fluorophores is of utmost importance. Although in our imaging we used AF568, CF568 is a better fluorophore in the orange channel. Additionally, MAP2 was only used as a reference under widefield and therefore a dSTORM compatible antibody was not used. If you would like to conduct 3-color dSTORM use Atto488.\nNote: For optimization of primary antibody concentration start at a 1:500 dilution or concentration recommended by the supplier (Refer to troubleshooting problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nNote: Always vortex and spin down antibodies before use.\nIncubate cells in secondary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 90 min at RT (20°C–22°C). Place dishes back into the humid chamber for incubation to ensure secondary antibody does not evaporate. Cover humid chamber in foil to prevent photobleaching of secondary antibodies.\nComplete a post staining fixation by incubating cells in 4% PFA buffer for 20 min at RT (20°C–22°C).\nStore samples in storage buffer in dark at 4°C.\nNote: Fixation time can be optimized to mitigate potential side effects.",
    "Pause point: Samples can be stored for at least one month before imaging (have not used samples beyond that timepoint).\ndSTORM image acquisition and SML localization\nTiming: Typically, it takes ∼10 min per image (50 fps), requiring multiple hours-days to image an entire experiment\nThis section describes the steps to acquire images and localize single molecules of inhibitory presynaptic protein vGAT and post-synaptic scaffold protein gephyrin. The imaging acquisition and analysis portion of this protocol can be expanded to a variety of other synaptic proteins to address the same fundamental question - how do different proteins cluster and organize at the synapse. This protocol is robust and applicable to other synaptic proteins with basic adjustments in antibody concentrations and the optimization of image acquisition settings (please see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section). In our laboratory this protocol has be used to investigate excitatory synapses in primary hippocampal culture, visualizing vGlut, PSD-95, Bassoon and in hippocampal slices visualizing Homer, Bassoon, GluA1, and GluA2.\nNote: The microscopy set-up used had these essential components: biplane illumination, lasers: 405 nm, 488 nm, 555 nm, and 640 nm, sCMOS detector, multi-band dichroic mirror, pentaband emission filter, and standard emission single bandpass filters (405, 488, 555, 640). Lasers that are compatible with 647, 568, and 488 (red, orange, and green respectively) fluorophores must be used.\nOptical Calibration: For accurate single molecule localization (SML) the focal planes and color channels of the optical system need to be aligned. Furthermore, to generate 3D measured point spread functions for sub-diffraction limit localization the point spread function (PSF) of a point source must be determined. 100 nm Tetraspeck bead samples that emit at blue, green, orange, and red were prepared on poly-d-lysine coated MatTek dishes [1:500] to calibrate the channels and planes. Resolution: X-Y: 20 nm, Z: 50 nm.",
    "Take dSTORM images with a 60× objective (1.3 NA, silicone oil).\nApply one drop of silicone immersion oil to the center of 60× objective (ensure no air bubbles during application).\nMount MatTek dish in chamber and replace storage solution with imaging buffer (∼200 μL to only cover the coverslip). Note the time to ensure image acquisition is within the buffer’s lifetime.\nMount the chamber into the stage-holder.\nUsing the 488 channel (exciting fluorophores tagged to MAP2) find your region of interest. Conduct search on a low laser power to prevent photo-switching and photobleaching. Ideal region is not too dense to allow for the isolation of pre and post synaptic localizations.\nPerform sequential imaging of the 640 channel and then the 555 channel. Begin image acquisition with constant illumination with the 640 nm laser at 463.4 mW while gradually increasing the 405 laser power from 1–10% of max power (49.7 mW) over imaging period. Take 20,000 frames of the 647 channel. Then illuminate the 555 nm laser at constant 555 mW for 10,000 frames. Generally, 3 regions of interest were imaged per coverslip.\nTake single z-plane images (z-distance = 2 μm due to biplane illumination).\nExposure time: 20 ms, 50 Frames per second.\nWidefield field of view of 200 μm × 200 μm and super resolution field of view 50 μm × 50 μm.\nNote: Upon excitation of the sample there should be robust photo-switching of the fluorophore, appearing as blinking. Following initiation, photo-switching should reach a steady state level. Adequate blinking is fundamental to SML therefore antibody concentrations, buffer conditions, and laser power should be optimized for experiments (please refer to troubleshooting problems 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3], and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).",
    "Note: Silicone oil closely matches the refractive index of cells decreasing spherical aberration while imaging and therefore increasing the quality of super resolution images; neurons (n = ∼1.38), silicone oil (n = 1.406).6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nIdentify individual molecules by their brightness above the background in a frame-by-frame process (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Generate a molecule’s coordinates in space by fitting the imaged PSF with the 3D measured PSF (step 13). As the raw data comes from the camera the SRX software works in parallel to conduct single molecule localizations. Images are filtered, particles are defined, and fluorophores localized.

If a fluorophore is active for a longer period of time max frame accumulation should be increased so the same fluorophore will not be detected as multiple blinking events.\nMax accumulation offset: 1px (100 nm) - Degree of fluorophore shift across sequential frames to be considered the same fluorophore.",
    "Max particles per frame: no max - Number of particles to be localized per frame.\nBackground slope removal threshold: 20 - The threshold of heterogeneity across the background of fluorophore’s cutout that is admissible for localization.\nCutout/background removal threshold: 0.2 - A signal to noise threshold ((total photon count of cutout – background photon count)/background photon count) that determines if a fluorophore is included for localization.\nDetection bandpass low frequency cutoff: 7.07px, Detection bandpass high frequency cutoff: 1.41px - 1st step of localization is the application of a smoothing filter to reduce noise for fluorophore identification.\nParameters for fluorophore localization:\n3D measured point spread functions are used for localization (experimental PSF is collected from bead calibration step 13). This is the optimal routine to use as calibration is specific to your system and imaging set-up.\nMax iterations: 40 – maximum number of iterations for one candidate particle.\nPSF Interpolation Spline method: B-Spline – method for PSF fitting for localization.\nTemporal Median Filter: 0 frames – method for the estimation of background signal.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nBackground threshold 647 channel: 50, 568 channel: 200 - Fluorescence values above the mean background that the software will treat as a localization.\nNote: Refer to troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] for suggestions on how to optimize localization parameters.\nNote: Single molecule localizations can generate large data sets, ensure your computer or external hard drive have adequate storage space (TB range).\ndSTORM image analysis\nTiming: Typically, it takes ∼10 min per image, requiring multiple hours to days to analyze an entire experiment",
    "This section describes the steps to analyze single molecule localizations of inhibitory presynaptic marker vGAT and post-synaptic scaffold protein gephyrin. After single molecules have been localized to a X,Y, and Z position in space based on their PSF, they are then grouped and clustered; single molecules are localized by their PSFs and clusters defined based on their spatial proximity to other molecules. To define synaptic clusters a clustering algorithm Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBScan) is used as it can define arbitrarily shaped clusters from a spatial database.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] Stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy-based relative localization analysis (Storm-RLA) is used to define a pre- and post-synaptic pair.\nSynaptic protein cluster analysis\nThe goal of this analysis is to understand the clustering dynamics of vGAT and gephyrin single molecule localizations using a proximity- and density-based analysis.\nConduct Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBScan) to define clusters of SMLs of the same probe based on proximity (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Parameters:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2453-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Image analysis pipeline\nSingle molecule localizations of the same probe are clustered according to the DBScan algorithm. Molecules not localized to a cluster are eliminated from further analysis. Cluster α shapes are determined and further analysis is conducted on gephyrin volume, vGAT-gephyrin centroid distance, and density. (Representative clusters obtained from data generated in Guzikowski and Kavalali,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] Images have been manipulated to represent potential outcomes of this protocol).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2453-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "r is the distance around one molecule that is searched for another molecule of the same probe. For a molecule to form a cluster it must have 2 molecules within the distance r. This molecule is considered a core molecule. The same routine is conducted for the 2 new molecules and subsequent localizations in their radii are considered part of the original cluster. If a molecule is considered part of a cluster but does not meet the density parameter, it is considered a boundary molecule. A molecule that does not meet the density or distance parameters is considered noise.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nMaximum Particle distance: 0.1 μm - threshold distance to determine if a particle is in one cluster or not clustered.\nCluster minimum particle count: 6 particles - need at least 6 particles within the defined distance to be labeled a cluster.\nSurface hulls α shape radius: 0.15 μm10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] - To determine cluster shape, point patterns of clusters were fit with an α shape, a bounding form that contains a clusters’ individual points to then extract cluster information i.e., volume. Ideal for clustering 3D shapes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: Cluster characteristics of the least dense cluster were used as global parameters to set threshold values.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] Due to Artemisinins treatment disrupting gephyrin clustering, the cluster minimum particle count value was quite low and should be optimized based on experimental question.\nFollowing the determination of clusters, localizations not grouped were eliminated from analysis and considered noise (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nFrom α shapes calculate cluster volume.\nPre-synaptic vGAT and post-synaptic gephyrin cluster spatial proximity",
    "The spatial distribution of vGAT and gephyrin clusters were mapped to define which clusters composed a pre- and post-synaptic juxtaposed synapse using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy-based relative localization analysis (Storm-RLA). Only vGAT and gephyrin clusters that were categorized as a paired pre- and post-synapse using this relative localization analysis (details in step 24) were included in further analysis.\nNote: With conventional confocal microscopy often pre-post-synapse colocalization analysis is done to define synaptic puncta. However, with super resolution microscopy x-y resolution is 20 nm, therefore pre- and post-markers can be differentiated in space and a spatial proximity analysis is performed (however there can be overlap in localizations from two different probes).\nInvestigate the spatial organization of vGAT and gephyrin clusters using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy-based relative localization analysis (Storm-RLA). Using the Storm—RLA algorithm cluster α shapes generated in step 21 are used to define a pre- and post-synaptic pair based on their position in space. From this eliminate non-paired clusters and calculate vGAT and gephyrin cluster centroid distance (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11] Parameters:\nMax cluster distance: 1 μm (generous threshold however the matrix created allowed the selection of the closest vGAT and gephyrin clusters as a synapse).\nCluster density analysis\nTo understand the spatial distribution of gephyrin molecules.\nAsses individual gephyrin clusters in 2D by condensing localizations to the X-Y plane. For each individual cluster determine a theoretical pair correlation function (PCF). A theoretical fit accounts for the density and shape of the cluster and generates a function as if the molecules were randomly organized. To compare density distributions across groups normalize individual PCFs of each individual cluster to their theoretical fit to account for shape, volume, and density.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12],13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] Parameters:\nSearch radius from center: 500 nm, 100 bins.",

The peaks in the function when g(r) > 1 demonstrate sub-synaptic clustering within a single cluster (Images have been manipulated to represent potential outcomes of this protocol).\nNote: The pair correlation function generated represents the point pattern of individual gephyrin molecules within a single cluster; g(r) as a function of distance from reference particle.
