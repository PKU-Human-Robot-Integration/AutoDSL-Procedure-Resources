  "procedures": [
    "1. Sample Preparation\nGenerate a mixed aqueous/organic product stream via continuous flow HTL of algae according to the reactor design and experimental procedure found in the literature10,11.\nUse a gravity separator to separate the product stream into an aqueous phase and organic phase.\nFilter 10 ml of the HTL aqueous phase using a 0.45 µm syringe filter and store in a refrigerator maintained at 4 °C for GC × GC–TOF-MS analysis.\n2. Instrument Components\nUse a gas chromatograph (GC) equipped with a quad-jet dual stage cooling-based modulator and time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (MS) for these experiments.\nConfigure the auto-sampler to inject 1 µl of each sample or standard into the GC. Use a randomized block design of sample and standard injections for the auto-sampler sequence as described in the literature13. The randomized block design is commonly used in quantitative studies to control for instrument operation. Our laboratory utilizes the design routinely even in comparative studies to verify instrument operation.\nConnect the primary and secondary column using a press-tight connector before the modulator. Ensure that both edges of both primary and secondary columns are cut straight without sharp edges before connecting to the press-tight connector.\nPlace ferrule on the GC column and then connect primary column to the GC injector so that 5 mm of column is inside the injector.\nEnsure that glass liner, non-stick liner O-ring and septa for GC injector are new and free of contamination.\nUse 1/16 x 0.5 mm ID transfer line ferrules to connect the secondary column and transfer line. Place a 0.2 m portion of the secondary column in the transfer line.\nEnsure that a 0.1 m portion of the secondary column is in the modulator.\nUse ultrahigh purity helium gas as carrier gas for GC at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min-1.",
    "Ensure there is sufficient liquid nitrogen in the Dewar which acts as a coolant in the modulator. The level of the liquid nitrogen in the Dewar can be predicted using a pressure gauge attached to its outlet. A 69 kPa reading of the pressure gauge indicates that the Dewar is full, while 0 kPa indicates that it is empty.\n3. Protocols Before Analyzing Samples\nEnsure there are no major leaks in the instrument. If the vacuum gauge reading of the TOF-MS is higher than 2.7 × 10-5 Pa for 1.5 ml min-1 GC column flow rate, this indicates a major leak in the system.\nSet-up the quality control (QC) method and run in-built 'acquisition system adjustments' protocol to achieve maximum signal response using manufacturer's protocol.\nRun in-built 'instrument optimization' protocols of QC method, in series - filament focus, ion optic focus and mass calibration tests using manufacturer's protocol. Ensure that mass calibration test passes. This QC method ensures that all the hardware parameters of the instrument are at optimum level.\nPerform a \"leak check\" using manufacturer's protocol. Analyze automatically generates leak check report. Ensure that the relative concentration of 28 (N2), 32 (O2) and 18 (moisture) ions must be below less than 10%, 3% and 5% of internal standard mass spectra of 69 ion, respectively.\nTune the TOF-MS using manufacturer's protocol.\nRun quality control method as well as TOF-MS tune protocol before and after leak check and also while analyzing samples and standards.\n4. Protocol to Determine the Optimum Modulation Period of Modulator\nArbitrarily select a long modulation period (e.g. 10 sec or 13 sec). Inject a sample as described in 2.2.",
    "Identify the retention time in second dimension of the contour plot after which no peaks elutes. Select identified second dimension retention time as optimum modulation period. Figure 2 clearly elucidate the identification of retention time in second dimension of the contour plot.\nIncrease the modulation period used in step 4.1 and perform the analysis again if \"wrap around\" is observed18. Wrap around phenomena occurs if the peaks in the second dimension elutes below the baseline of first dimension. Example contour plot for 'wraparound' is shown in supplementary information Figure 3.\nRepeat steps 4.2 and 4.3 until optimum value is determined.\n5. Experimental Parameters of Instrument Set-up\nInstall a polar (60 m x 0.25 mm x 0.5 µm film thickness) capillary column as the primary column and a non-polar (2.3 m x 0.25 mm x 0.5 µm film thickness) capillary column as the secondary column. Bake both the primary and secondary column for at least 2 hr to remove trace amounts of moisture, air and contaminants associated with new GC columns.\nUse ultrahigh purity helium gas as carrier gas for GC at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min-1.\nSet the GC injector to a temperature of 260 °C and a split ratio of 1:250.\nEmploy the following temperature program for the primary column: a constant temperature of 40 °C for 0.2 min followed by a temperature ramp to 260 °C at 5 °C min-1, followed by a constant temperature of 260 °C for 5 min.\nMaintain the modulator temperature 5 °C higher than that of the secondary column and the secondary column temperature at 5 °C higher than that of the primary column.",
    "Use an optimum modulation period of 4 sec with 0.8 sec of hot pulse and 1.2 sec of cold pulse. This value is determined based on the protocol described in section 4.\nSet transfer line temperature to 270 °C.\nSet the acquisition delay or solvent delay to 0 sec.\nSet the lower and higher range of m/z as 35 and 800, respectively.\nSet the MS detector acquisition rate at 400 spectra/sec.\nMaintain the MS detector voltage at 150 V higher than the optimized value.\nMaintain the MS ion source temperature at 225 °C.\n6. Data Analysis\nPerform data processing using the software supplied by the instrument manufacturer.\nSelect the following tasks in the data analysis method - Compute baseline, find peaks above the baseline, library search and calculate are/height.\nTrack the baseline through the data file. Enter baseline offset as 0.5.\n\tEnter expected peak width of 15 sec in the first dimension and 0.15 sec in the second dimension.\nSet signal-to-noise ratio as 5,000 and similarity values of >850 for identification of compounds.\nSelect a commercially available mass spectral library to identify chemical compounds present in samples and set the library search mode to forward.\nProcess the data files using this data analysis method using manufacturer's protocol. It requires at least 1 hr to process a data file.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
