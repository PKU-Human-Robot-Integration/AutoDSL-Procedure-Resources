    "The protocol follows ethical guidelines and was approved by the Ethical Committee (Comité-de-Protection-des-Personnes Ile-de-France-II, #2015-09-04).\n1. Preparation of the materials\nPreparation of 1x wash buffer\nPrepare 3 L of 1x wash buffer by adding 2.94 L of distilled water and one bottle (60 mL) of wash buffer (50x) (see the Table of Materials) to a large carboy. Mix well.\n\t\tNOTE: The 1x wash buffer may be prepared ahead of time and stored at room temperature for up to 1 month.\nPreparation of counterstaining reagents\nPrepare 50% hematoxylin.\n\t\t\nIn a fume hood, add 100 mL of Gill’s hematoxylin I (see the Table of Materials) to 100 mL of distilled water in a staining dish.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The 50% hematoxylin staining solution can be reused for up to 1 week.\nPrepare 0.02% (w/v) ammonia water (bluing reagent).\nIn the fume hood, add 1.43 mL of 1 N ammonium hydroxide to 250 mL of distilled water in a graduated cylinder or another container. Seal the cylinder with paraffin film. Mix its contents well for 3x–5x.\n\t\tNOTE: For assay quantitation, it is critical to use ammonium hydroxide. The reagents may be prepared ahead of time. Ensure all containers remain covered.\nPreparation of 1x target retrieval reagent\nIn a large beaker, add 70 mL of 10x target retrieval reagent (see the Table of Materials) to 630 mL of distilled water.\nPlace the beaker on a heating plate with a magnetic stirrer. Cover it with aluminum foil.\nBoil its contents at 100 °C for 10–15 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not let it boil for more than 30 min.\nReagent equilibration\nEnsure the hybridization oven is on and at 40 °C. Place wet humidifying paper at the bottom of the tray.\n\t\tNOTE: A hybridization oven (see the Table of Materials) is needed for steps 3.4 to 4.2.",
    "Remove the amplification reagents (AMP1–AMP6, see the Table of Materials) from the refrigerator and keep them at room temperature, at least 30 min before the relevant incubation step.\nBefore each use, warm the target and/or control probes for at least 10 min at 40 °C in the oven or in a water bath or incubator.\n2. Adhesion enhancing and deparaffinization in the fume hood\nNOTE: Start the protocol with 3–5 µm-thick histological samples mounted on unstained slides.\nIn order to enhance adhesion, bake the slides at 60 °C for 1 h or at 40 °C overnight in an oven.\nCharge the slide rack with unstained histological slides. Immerse the slide rack for 5 min in fresh xylene contained in a staining dish, with occasional agitation. repeat with fresh xylene.\nImmerse the slide rack for 3 min in fresh 100% ethanol contained in a staining dish, with constant agitation. Repeat with fresh 100% ethanol.\nLet the slides dry for 2 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Do not reuse deparaffinization reagents for dehydration of the slides after the assay.\n3. Tissue pretreatment\nNOTE: These steps follow the “standard” pretreatment recommendation according to the manufacturer’s instructions for head and neck samples. The timing of sections 3.1 and 3.2 may need to be adjusted depending on the manipulated tissue.\nBlockade of peroxidase activity\nAdd 4–6 drops of hydrogen peroxide (see the Table of Materials) to each slide and incubate them for 10 min at room temperature.\nWash the slides 2x for 2 min in distilled water at room temperature.\nBreakage of RNA/tissue bounds \nWith a claw, remove the aluminum foil from the boiling 1x target retrieval reagent (TTR1x) from section 1.3 and stop stirring. Immerse the slide rack slowly and very carefully for 15 min. Cover the beaker again with the aluminum foil.",
    "NOTE: Simmering has to persist during this step.\n\t\tCAUTION: Use the claw to manipulate the aluminum foil and the slide rack so as to avoid burn injuries. Make sure to wear proper personal protective equipment, such as gloves and a lab coat.\nWith the claw, immediately transfer the hot slide rack to a distilled water bath and wash it for 2 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure the samples do not cool down in the TTR1x.\nWash the slides in fresh 100% ethanol for 2 min.\nLet the slides dry at room temperature for 2 min.\nBarrier creation\nWith a hydrophobic barrier pen (see the Table of Materials), draw a barrier around the sample. Let it dry out at for least 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Allow the barrier to really dry out. If it wears out during the procedure, do not hesitate to draw it again. Avoid touching the tissue with the pen. The protocol can be paused overnight here.\nProtease digestion\nPlace the slides on the slide rack and add ~4 drops of Protease Plus per sample (see the Table of Materials).\nCover the humidity control tray with a lid and insert it into the hybridization oven for 30 min at 40 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: To prevent evaporation, make sure the turn knob is completely turned to the lock position.\nRemove the tray from the oven and remove the slide rack.\nOne slide at a time, quickly remove any excess liquid and place the slide in a slide rack submerged in a staining dish filled with distilled water.\nWash the slides 2x for 2 min in distilled water at room temperature. Agitate constantly.\n4. Running the assay\nNOTE: Do not let sections dry out between the incubation steps.\nHybridization of the HPV probe",
    "NOTE: Ensure the probes are prewarmed to dissolve any precipitation prior to use. For this step, instead of HPV probe, peptidyl-prolyl isomerase B (PPIB) for positive control or dihydrodipicolinate reductase (DAPB) for negative control (see the Table of Materials) may also be used.\n\t\nTap and/or flick the slides to remove any excess liquid and place them in the slide rack. Add ~4 drops of HPV probe to entirely cover each section.\nCover the tray with a lid and insert it into the oven for 2 h at 40 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: To prevent evaporation, make sure the turn nob is completely turned to the lock position.\nRemove the tray from the oven and remove the slide rack.\nOne slide at a time, quickly remove any excess liquid and place the slide in a slide rack submerged in a staining dish filled with 1x wash buffer.\nWash the slides in 1x wash buffer for 2 min at room temperature with constant agitation. Repeat this with fresh 1x wash buffer.\nHybridization of AMP1, AMP2, AMP3, and AMP4\n\tNOTE: These steps include hybridization in the hybridization oven and AMP1–AMP4 from the purchased kit (see the Table of Materials).\n\t\nTap and/or flick to remove any excess liquid from the slides and place them in the slide rack. Add ~4 drops of AMP1 to entirely cover each section.\nCover the tray with a lid and insert it into the oven for 30 min at 40 °C.\nRemove the tray from the oven and remove the slide rack.\nOne slide at a time, quickly remove any excess liquid and place the slide in a slide rack submerged in a staining dish filled with 1x wash buffer.",
    "Wash the slides in 1x wash buffer for 2 min at room temperature with constant agitation. Repeat this with fresh 1x wash buffer.\nRepeat steps 4.2.1–4.2.5, but use ~4 drops of AMP2 instead of AMP1 and incubate for 15 min at 40 °C. Wash the slides 2x for 2 min, both times in fresh wash buffer.\nRepeat steps 4.2.1–4.2.5, but use ~4 drops of AMP3 instead of AMP1 and incubate for 30 min at 40 °C. Wash the slides 2x for 2 min, both times in fresh wash buffer.\nRepeat steps 4.2.1–4.2.5, but use ~4 drops of AMP4 instead of AMP1 and incubate for 15 min at 40 °C. Wash the slides 2x for 2 min, both times in fresh wash buffer.\nHybridization of AMP5 and AMP6\n\tNOTE: These steps do not include hybridization in the oven but hybridization at room temperature. AMP5 and AMP6 come from the purchased kit (see the Table of Materials).\n\t\nTap and/or flick the slides to remove any excess liquid and place them in the slide rack. Add ~4 drops of AMP5 to entirely cover each section.\nCover the tray with a lid and incubate for 30 min at room temperature.\nOne slide at a time, quickly remove any excess liquid and place it in a slide rack submerged in a staining dish filled with 1x wash buffer.\nWash the slides in 1x wash buffer for 2 min at room temperature with constant agitation.

Wash the slides 2x for 2 min, both times in fresh wash buffer.\n5. Signal detection with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine",
    "CAUTION: Diaminobenzidine (DAB) is toxic. Follow appropriate precautions and safety guidelines when disposing of and handling this chemical.\nMix equal volumes of DAB-A and DAB-B (see the Table of Materials) in an appropriately sized tube by dispensing the same number of drops of each solution. Make ~120 µL of DAB substrate per section (~2 drops of each reagent/total of 4). Mix it well for 3x–5x.\nTake each slide, one at a time, from the slide rack and tap and/or flick to remove the excess liquid before placing it in the slide rack.\nPipette ~120 μL of DAB onto each tissue section. Ensure the sections are covered, and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nDispose the remaining DAB according to local regulation and insert the slide into a slide rack submerged in a staining dish filled with tap water.\n6. Counterstaining\nMove the slide rack to a staining dish containing 50% hematoxylin staining solution let it rest for 30 s at room temperature. Note that the slides will become purple.\nImmediately transfer the slide rack back to a staining dish containing tap water, and wash the slides 3x–5x by moving the rack up and down.\nKeep repeating the washing step with fresh tap water until the slides are clear, while sections remain purple.\nReplace the tap water in the staining dish with 0.02% ammonia water. Move the rack up and down 2x–3x. Note that the tissue section should turn blue.\nReplace the ammonia water with tap water. Wash the slides 3x–5x.\n7. Dehydration\nMove the slide rack to a staining dish containing 70% ethanol in the fume hood and let it rest for 2 min with occasional agitation.\nMove the slide rack to a first staining dish containing 100% ethanol and let it rest for 2 min with occasional agitation.",
    "Move the slide rack to a second staining dish containing 100% ethanol and let it rest for 2 min with occasional agitation.\nMove the slide rack to a staining dish containing xylene and let it rest for 5 min with occasional agitation.\n8. Slide mounting\nRemove the slides from the slide rack and lay them flat with the sections facing up in the fume hood.\nMount one slide at a time by adding 1 drop of a xylene-based mounting medium to each slide and carefully placing a 24 mm x 50 mm coverslip over the section. Avoid trapping any air bubbles.\nAir-dry the slides for ≥5 min.\n9. Sample evaluation\nExamine the tissue sections under a standard brightfield microscope at 20x–40x magnification.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
