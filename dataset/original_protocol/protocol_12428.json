    "NOTE: The following protocol follows the guidelines of Rutgers University human research ethics committee.\n1. Stimuli\nUse sets of photographs that each belongs to the same category. Choose the number of stimuli that best fits the experimental question; much of the previous work with this procedure used 24 photographs per category;\nFor the study of the detection of social threats, use schematic drawings or photographs of angry faces as the threatening stimuli, such as the adult angry faces found in the NimStim face set5, 7-9. Alternatively, use fearful faces5.\nFor the study of the detection of social threats in children, use adult face stimuli such as the ones described above, or use photographs of child angry faces, such as those in the Child Affective Facial Expression set (CAFE)8, see note below.\n\tNote: LoBue, V., & Thrasher, C. The Child Affective Facial Expression (CAFE) Set: Validity and reliability from untrained adults. (2014).\nFor the study of the detection of threatening animals such as snakes and spiders, use photographs of animals from nature books or websites3-4,7.\nChoose a category of neutral comparison stimuli that is well matched to the threatening category. If studying threatening (angry/fearful) faces, use neutral or happy faces as the comparison stimuli. If studying threatening animals (e.g., snakes/spiders), use a perceptually similar non-threatening animal (e.g., frogs/cockroaches) 3-4.\nChoose the distracter stimuli. Either interchange the targets and distracters (e.g., snake targets among frog distracters, and frog targets among snake distracters), or use a uniform set of distracters for the threatening and non-threatening target conditions (e.g., snake targets among flower distracters, and frog targets among flower distracters).\n\tNOTE: See Discussion for issues with choosing appropriate distracters.",
    "When the stimuli are made up of photographs of faces, use an equal number of male and female faces, and vary the faces for race based on the availability of different races/ethnicities in each set.\nWhen the stimuli are made up of photographs of animals or plants, match the categories for color and brightness, or use black and white photographs3-4,7. \n2. Equipment\nObtain a computer with a touch-screen monitor for the task. Use a stand-alone touch-screen monitor that connects to standard VGA ports for any PC, or use a tablet PC that functions as an all-in-one computer and touch-screen.\nChoose the parameters of the study, including matrix size and number of trials.\n\tNOTE: Previous work has used 9-picture (3 by 3) matrices, or 4-picture (2 by 2) matrices, and 24 trials, but other parameters may be used.\nUse either a customized program to present the matrices to participants, commercial presentation software such as EPrime, or access the Matrix program designed specifically for this methodology on the author’s website.\n\tNOTE: The Matrix program allows for flexible study parameters. It gives researchers the option to choose matrix size, number of trials, and stimuli. It also randomly arranges the stimuli within each matrix, and presents them in a random order.\nArrange the touch-screen monitor/computer at a desk or table with an outline of handprints located on the table in front of the monitor. Use the handprints as a starting point so that the participants’ hands are in the same place for the start of each trial.\n3. Child Procedure\nEnsure that vision impaired children are wearing their glasses or contact lenses throughout the procedure. Exclude vision impaired children who do not have a corrective device.\nSeat participants at arm’s length from the base of the touch-screen monitor before beginning the experiment.",
    "Instruct children to place their hands on the handprints. Do this between every trial so that the participants’ hands are in the same place at the beginning of every trial.\nStand alongside the monitor to instruct the participant throughout the procedure.\nFirst explain the task to the child: “Are you ready to play a computer game with me? This is a special computer that you can touch! I’m going to show you a bunch of pictures on the screen and ask you to touch some of them. Are you ready?”\nNext, teach the child participants how to use the touch-screen by giving them several practice trials. On the first practice trial, present participants with a single photograph from the target category, and ask them to touch it on the screen. Use the following language: “This is a (target). Can you touch the (target) on the screen?”\nOn the second practice trial, present participants with a single photograph from the distracter category, and ask them to touch it on the screen. Use the following language: “This is a (distracter). Can you touch the (distracter) on the screen?”\nOn the next three practice trials, present participants with full nine-picture matrices with one target among eight distracters. When the first nine-picture practice matrix appears on the screen, give the following instructions: “When you see the pictures come up on the screen, it’s your job to find the (target) and touch it as fast as you can. Can you do that? Do you think you can find the (targets) really fast?”\n\tNOTE: The procedure can be modified for matrices of other sizes, such as 2 × 2, 1 × 1, etc.",
    "Between each full-matrix trial, design the stimulus presentation program so that a smiley face icon appears. Explain to the child: “It’s your job to touch the (targets), and it’s my job to touch the smiley face.” Reinforce these directions if the child attempts to touch the smiley face between subsequent trials.\nUse the smiley face between each trial to ensure that the child’s full attention is on the screen before the onset of the next trial. When the child’s hands are on the handprints and he/she is looking at the screen, press the smiley face icon to continue. Do this between every trial.\nTouch the smiley face and continue to the second and third practice trials. If the child does not touch the target on the screen, reiterate the instructions: “Remember, your job is to find the (target) as fast as you can and touch it on the screen!”\nNext, present participants with the test trials.\nUse a stimulus presentation program that automatically records latency to touch the screen from the onset of each matrix. Present matrices on the screen until the participants touch the target. Do not record latency when the smiley face icon is displayed; use this icon to redirect the child’s attention to the screen, and to reiterate instructions if necessary.\nIdentify errors from your latency data. Errors are trials in which participants select one of the distracter stimuli instead of the target. Custom stimulus presentation software should be written so that errors are identified and marked in the output.\nCalculate average latency to detect the target stimuli for each participant after eliminating errors. Use these data for the statistical analyses.\n4. Adult Procedure",
    "Ensure that vision impaired adults are wearing their glasses or contact lenses throughout the procedure. Exclude vision impaired adults who do not have a corrective device.\nSeat participants at arm’s length from the base of the touch-screen monitor.\nInstruct the participant to place his/her hands on the handprints to ensure that the participants’ hands are in the same place at the onset of every trial.\nStand alongside the monitor to instruct the participant throughout the procedure.\nIn order to teach participants how to use the touch-screen, give them several practice trials. In the first two practice trials, ask participants to touch a single picture from the target category on the screen, followed by a single picture from the distracter category.\nOn the next three practice trials, present participants with full nine-picture matrices with one target amid eight distracters.\nInstruct participants to find the targets and touch them on the screen as quickly as possible. Then return his/her hands to the handprints.\n\tNOTE: The smiley face between each trial is not necessary for adult participants; you can choose whether to use it or eliminate it.\nIf using the smiley faces, instruct participants to touch the smiley face to move on to the next trial.\nFollowing practice trials, present participants the test trials, each containing one target and eight distracters.\nUse a stimulus presentation program that automatically records latency to touch the screen from the onset of each matrix.\nIdentify errors from your latency data, as specified in step 3.13.\nCalculate average latency to detect the target stimuli for each participant after eliminating errors. Use these data for the statistical analyses."
