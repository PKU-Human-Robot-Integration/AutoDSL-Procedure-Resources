    "Prior to any animal experimentation obtain the local institutional animal care committee authorization. The current experiments were performed after approval by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.\n1. PH induction\nPreparation\n\t\nBefore beginning the study, carefully plan the experimental design. Ensure that mice are subjected to hypoxia at the same time point as the first SU5416 injection. An example of the experimental design for inducing PH using the Hypoxia/SU5416 method is shown in Figure 1A. Control mice received only the vehicle. For this model, SU5416 will be injected to the mice once per week for 3 consecutive weeks.\nUse eight to twelve-week-old C57BL/6 mice for this study. House the animals at 18-20 °C in a 12-h light-dark cycle. Ensure that food and water are accessible ad libitum.\nWeigh the animals. Assign them randomly to each group: Normoxia and Hypoxia/SU5416.\nPrepare the hypoxic chamber as shown in Figure 1B. Secure nitrogen (N2) tanks near the chamber. Set the oxygen (O2) controller at a point of 10% O2. Let the system reach a steady state.\nPrepare SU5416 for injection (use a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight). SU5416 does not dissolve in aqueous solutions; therefore, dissolve the calculated amount in 100 μL DMSO8. For example, for a 25 g mouse, the amount of SU5416 to be injected is 0.5 mg dissolved in 100 μL solvent (DMSO). The final concentration of SU5416 for this mouse is, therefore, 5 mg/mL.\n\t\tCAUTION: SU5416 is a hazardous material. Carefully read the Safety Data Sheet accompanied by the product and make sure to take the recommended precautions when handling this substance. Wear protective gloves and (as for any injection) use eye protection. The chemical structure of SU5416 is shown in Figure 1C.",
    "NOTE: Calculate an appropriate excess of the solution to compensate for the volume that will be lost during injection (e.g. in the syringe, vial etc.). Depending on the syringe used, the dead volume is approximately 200 μL. For a group of 10 mice, calculate an excess of 2 mouse doses.\nPrepare the syringes for injection. Use 1 mL syringes with a 25 G x 5/8” needles.\nSU5416 subcutaneous injection\n\t\nRestrain the animal. Place the mouse on the lid of the cage to assist restraint. Grasp the skin and form a tent parallel to the spine. Make sure to grasp to the back of the head tightly, to avoid the potential bite injury by the mouse.\n\t\tNOTE: The presence of two investigators makes the procedure faster and more accurate as one can hold the animal while the other performs the injection.\nInsert the needle subcutaneously over the flank at the loose fold of the skin. Make sure to insert the needle parallel to the skin. Avoid penetrating the abdominal wall.\nInject the syringe’s content (100 μL of dissolved SU5416 or vehicle).\n\t\tNOTE: In order to avoid leakage after complete delivery, hold the syringe for approximately 10 s and slightly rotate the needle under the skin.\nWithdraw the needle and return the animal to its cage. After SU5416 injection, place the cages in the ventilated hypoxia chamber.\nExposure to hypoxia\n\t\nMonitor the ventilation over time. Make sure to maintain 10% of the oxygen supply. Maintain normoxia animals in a semi-sealable chamber in at 21% O2.\nEnsure that the chambers are equipped with an oxygen sensor to measure the oxygen level. Avoid extensive opening of the chambers. For cleaning and adding food and water open the chambers for not more than 20 min every 3 days.",
    "Inspect animals daily. Consider stress signals such as piloerection or significant loss of weight.\n\t\tNOTE: Animals under Hypoxia/SU5416 are expected to lose weight5. This is an indication of disease development.\nRepeat SU5416 injection weekly for 3 consecutive weeks (see Figure 1A for the overview of the experimental design).\n\t\tNOTE: Varying the site of injection can help reduce skin irritations.\n2. Functional characterization by invasive RV pressure measurements\nPreparation\n\tNOTE: Select an anesthetic regime. Injectable or inhalable anesthetics can be used. Since a slight overdose of injectable anesthetics (especially from ketamine/xylazine or pentobarbital) can significantly affect the heart function, the use of volatile anesthetics is recommended. It is of great importance to use the same anesthetic for all mice within a study.\n\t\nUse a vaporizer to assure an accurate anesthetics dose per animal. The dose for isoflurane is as following: induction 3-4%, maintenance 1% mixed with 100% oxygen.\n\t\tNOTE: Wear personal protective equipment and avoid breathing the vapor.\nPrepare a heating pad and/or warming lamps for maintaining body temperature. Prepare a rectal temperature probe for monitoring body temperature.\nEnsure proper ventilation. Prepare the ventilator beforehand. Prepare the Y-tube connector and check the function of the ventilator using the manual mode. Ensure the inspiratory pressure is <1 cm H2O to avoid barotrauma. Set the respiratory rate at 110 breaths/min.\nPrepare an endotracheal tube by cutting a 20 G intravascular catheter.\nPrepare the instruments needed: small forceps, scissors, elastic hook retractors, vessel cauterizer, and cotton swabs. On a cotton swab adjust a small 25 G x 5/8” needle that will be used to make a small puncture in the right ventricle.",
    "Prepare the Pressure Catheter, the Pressure-volume Control Unit and initiate the data acquisition software. Place the PV Catheter in a 15 mL tube filled with PBS at 37 °C for 15 min and calibrate according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nFor the perfusion and fixation of the organs, prepare PBS and a solution of 50% PBS / 50% OCT. Prepare 2 x 10 mL syringes (with a 25 G needle): one will be used for perfusing the heart and the lung with PBS in situ and the second one for injecting the OCT/ PBS (50/50) solution to the lung specimen that will be used for histologic examination.\nIntubation\n\t\nWeigh the mouse and record the health status before anesthesia.\nInduce anesthesia with 3-4% isoflurane. Check the anesthesia depth by testing the toe-pinch reflex: pinch the toe of one of the limbs firmly. If the animal withdraws the limb, it is a sign of insufficient anesthesia.\nAfter anesthesia induction, shave the neck and the chest areas.\nPlace the mouse on the heating pad. Place a rectal temperature probe for monitoring body temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: Maintenance of body temperature is of importance for the functional measurements. The body temperature should be approximately 36.5-37 °C.\nUsing curved forceps attach a suture thread to the upper incisors of the mouse, stretch and fix to the heating pad with surgical tape. Secure the limbs of the mouse using surgical tapes.\nFor intubating the animal make a small incision of approximately 1 cm in the medial cervical skin using small scissors.\n\t\tNOTE: Oral intubation is an alternative method that requires more experience.\nWith a cotton-tipped applicator separate bluntly the parotid and submandibular salivary glands at the midlevel. This will expose the muscles overlying the trachea.\nCarefully cut these muscles exposing the trachea.",
    "With small scissors make a small incision between the tracheal cartilages and insert the prepared endotracheal tube. Take out the metal guide of the intravascular catheter.\nConnect the catheter to the ventilator. Verify the tracheal tube position by manually gently inflating the lungs. Secure the position with tape.\nMaintain a 1% isoflurane anesthesia throughout the procedure.\nRegularly monitor the depth of anesthesia by testing the toe pinch reflex. Adjust the anesthesia accordingly.\n\t\tNOTE: The recommended heart rate during the experiments, under 1% isoflurane anesthesia, is approximately 400 beats /min. Maintenance of body temperature and anesthesia are essential for controlling the heart rate. Excess of isoflurane can reduce the heart rate. However, recovery can be achieved by reducing the isoflurane rate.\nRV pressure measurements (open chest approach)\n\t\nWith small scissors perform a skin incision of approximately 1 cm over the xiphoid process and the upper abdominal part. Separate the skin covering the chest and the abdominal wall of the upper abdominal quadrants: start at the middle line, distal to the xiphoid and carefully move laterally on both sides. Use thermocautery to control bleeding.\n\t\tNOTE: The goal is to have access to the thoracic cavity through the abdominal wall.\nOpen the abdominal cavity and cut the diaphragm carefully, taking care not to injure the beating heart or the lungs.\n\t\tNOTE: The goal is to expose the apex and the right ventricle of the heart. Good exposure and view of the heart are of crucial importance for the correct placement of the catheter. It is of great importance to avoid bleeding throughout the procedure. Even small changes in the intravasal volume can change the load of the right heart and affect the recorded parameters.\nGently remove the pericardium using a cotton-tipped applicator.",
    "Just before placing the pressure catheter in the heart, bring the catheter next to the mouse.\nUsing the prepared cotton-tipped applicator with the needle makes a stab wound in the apical distal part of the right ventricle. Carefully remove the needle and insert the pressure catheter into this hole.\n\t\tNOTE: This should work without applying force. In case this is not possible, try making a new hole near the first one in order to avoid extended injury of the heart. The needle should not be inserted more deeply than approximately 3 mm.\nInsert the pressure catheter parallel to the direction of the right ventricle, with the tip facing the pulmonary artery.\nWatch the pressure wave tracing to ensure the correct positioning of the catheter. Representative tracings are demonstrated in Figure 2.\nAllow the pressure signal to stabilize. Pause respirations and obtain at least 3 measurements. In between the individual measurements allow the animal to be ventilated.\nOnce all measurements are recorded remove the catheter and place it back in the PBS filled tube in the water bath.\n\t\tNOTE: After completion of the experiment, clean the catheter according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nEuthanasia and lung perfusion\n\t\nUpon completion of the experiment euthanize the mouse by exsanguination.\nOpen the chest widely. Using scissors, cut the entire sternum and pay attention not to injure the heart or the lungs.\nUsing iris scissors makes a small incision in the left ventricle to allow blood to leave the chamber.\nPlace the 25 G needle of a syringe containing 10 mL of PBS in the right ventricle and inject the PBS solution until the lungs are cleared of blood.",
    "Once this step is completed, confirm euthanasia by vital tissue harvest (heart and lungs): cut the cava and aortic attachments and remove the heart and lungs en block.\n3. Morphometric characterization\nImmediately after removing the heart and lungs (Step 2.4.5), isolate the heart and remove both atria. With curved tenotomy scissors dissect carefully the right ventricle (RV) from the left ventricle (LV), leaving the septum (S) with the left ventricle. Weigh RV and LV+S and calculate the Fulton index= RV/LV+ S (Figure 3)5,9.\nTake a part of the right ventricle and place it in an OCT prefilled embedding mold. Use the other part of the right ventricle for RNA and/or protein analysis. Snap freeze in dry ice and store at -80 °C.\nUse iris scissors to isolate the lungs from the heart and any other remaining tissue.\n\tNOTE: For the preparation of the lungs, the perfusion as described above (Steps 2.4.3-2.4.5) is of great importance.\nSnap freeze part of the lungs and store it for RNA, protein extraction or other assays.\nUse the other part of the lungs for histological analysis. For this purpose, insert the syringe containing 50% PBS and 50% OCT in a bronchus of the used lobe10,11. The experimenter can easily see that the lung gets inflated when the syringe’s content is perfused in the tissue.\nPlace these pieces of lung in embedding molds prefilled with OCT and snap freeze them in dry ice. Store the samples at -80 °C after they are frozen.\nPrepare 8 μm sections of RV and lung using a cryostat machine. Air dry the sections at room temperature for 30 min.\nFix the slides at room temperature using 10% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min.",
    "NOTE: PFA is a known human carcinogen. Reduce the exposure risk by using a chemical fume hood, proper procedures and personal protective equipment. Refer to the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for further information.\nVascular remodeling assessment by Hematoxylin/Eosin staining\n\tNote: Perform Hematoxylin/Eosin staining in order to assess the structural changes of the heart and vascular remodeling in the lung (Figure 3).\n\t\nStain with Hematoxylin solution for 8 min.\nRinse with running tap water for 5 min followed by a quick rinse in distilled water.\nRinse in 95% EtOH for 1 min and counter-stain in the Eosin solution for 1 min.\nDehydrate (80% Ethanol 10-30 s, 100 Ethanol for 1 min and 100% Toluol for 3 min).\nMount and cover with a coverslip. Dry the slides overnight at room temperature.\n\t\tNOTE: The solutions used for staining may be hazardous. Reduce the exposure risk by using a chemical fume hood, proper procedures and personal protective equipment. Refer to the MSDS for further information.\nRight ventricular fibrosis assessment by Picrosirius Red Staining\n\tNOTE: In the Picrosirius Red Staining, Picrosirius Red, which is acid, binds to collagen12. Therefore, this staining can be used for a histological examination of the collagen content.\n\t\nIncubate the slides in a preheated Bouin’s Solution at 58 °C for 1 h.\nWash the slides in running tap water to remove yellow color from sections for 10-15 min.\nStain in 0.1% Fast Green for 20 min at room temperature.\nRinse in 1% Acetic Acid for 1 min.\nRinse in tap water for 5 min.\nStain in 0.1% Sirius red for 30 min at room temperature followed by dehydration in Toluol.",
    "CAUTION: The solutions used for staining may be hazardous. Reduce the exposure risk by using a chemical fume hood, proper procedures and personal protective equipment. Refer to the MSDS for further information.\nRV cardiomyocyte hypertrophy assessment by WGA Staining\n\tNOTE: Hypertrophy of the right ventricle (RV) at the cellular level can be assessed by performing a Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) staining (Figure 4).\n\t\nFix the slides in cold Acetone solution for 15 min followed by 3 steps of washing in PBS (5 min each).\nBlock with 10% goat serum in a Dako solution for 30 min at room temperature.\nIncubate the slides with WGA: Add WGA 1:200 and incubate for 1 ½ h at 37 °C in the dark.\nWash the slides three times with PBS.\nIncubate the slides with a nucleic acid dye.\nWash the slides three times with PBS.\nFor mounting, remove the excess of liquid and apply mounting media and a coverslip. Dry the slides for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark and store at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: The solutions used for staining may be hazardous. Reduce the exposure risk by using a chemical fume hood, proper procedures and personal protective equipment. Refer to the MSDS for further information.\nPerform immunochemistry of the lung to further and specifically assess vascular remodeling. For example, smooth muscle cell staining can be used to assess the muscularization of the vessels, while von Willebrand Factor staining can be used to visualize endothelial changes.
