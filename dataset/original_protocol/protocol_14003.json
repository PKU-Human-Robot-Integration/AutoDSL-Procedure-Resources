    "All procedures have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Stanford University.\n1. Ocular hypertension induction by intracameral injection of SO\nPrepare a glass micropipette for intracameral SO injection by pulling a glass capillary with a pipette puller to generate a micropipette. Cut an opening at the tip of the micropipette and further sharpen the tip with a microgrinder-beveling machine to make a 35°−40° bevel.\nPolish the edges of the bevel and remove all debris by washing with water. Autoclave the micropipette before use.\nPrepare the paracentesis needle for the corneal entry. To do so, attach a 32 G needle to a 5 mL syringe on a Luer lock, and further secure it with tape. Bend the needle bevel tip face up at 30°.\nPrepare the SO injector by attaching and securing a blunt end 18 G needle on a 10 mL syringe first. Then attach a plastic tube with the 18 G needle on one end and fill up with SO as needed through the other end.\nAttach the sterilized micropipette to the plastic tube and push the syringe plunger to fill the entire micropipette with SO.\n2. Intracameral SO injection for one eye\nPlace a 9−10-week-old male C57B6/J mouse into an induction chamber with 3% isoflurane mixed with oxygen at 2 L/min for 3 min.\nIntraperitoneally inject 2,2,2-tribromoethanol at 0.3 mg/g body weight.\n\tNOTE: Unlike ketamine/xylazine, 2,2,2-tribromoethanol does not cause obvious pupil dilation.\nCheck for the lack of response to a toe pinch and the lack of movement of the whiskers or the tail to determine the anesthetic strength.\nPlace the mouse in a lateral position on a surgery platform. To reduce its sensitivity during the procedure, apply one drop of 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride to the cornea before the injection.",
    "Make an entry incision with the 32 G paracentesis needle at the superotemporal quadrant, about 0.5 mm from the limbus.\nTunnel through the layers of the cornea for about 0.3 mm before piercing into the anterior chamber. Be careful not to touch the lens or iris.\nWithdraw the needle slowly to release some aqueous humor (about 1−2 µL) from the anterior chamber through the tunnel (paracentesis).\nWait ~8 min to further decrease the IOP. This can be determined by measuring the contralateral, control eye.\nInsert the glass micropipette preloaded with SO through the corneal tunnel into the anterior chamber, with the bevel facing down to the iris surface.\nPush the syringe plunger slowly to inject SO into the anterior chamber until the SO droplet covers most of the iris surface, ~2.3−2.4 mm in diameter.\nLeave the micropipette in the anterior chamber for 10 s more before withdrawing it slowly.\nGently push the upper eyelid to close the cornea incision to minimize SO leakage.\nApply antibiotic ointment (bacitracin-neomycin-polymyxin) to the eye surface.\nThroughout the procedure, frequently moisten the cornea with artificial tears.\nKeep the mouse on the heating pad until fully recovered from anesthesia.\n3. SO removal\nPrepare the irrigation system.\n\t\nPrepare the irrigating solution according to the manufacturer’s instructions and place it in the irrigation bottle. Elevate the irrigating solution bottle to 110−120 cm (81−88 mmHg) above the surgery platform.\nAttach an IV administration set to the irrigating solution bottle. Remove air bubbles from the IV tubing. Connect a 33 G needle bent to 20° face up to the IV tubing.\nTo prepare the drainage system, remove the plunger from a 1 mL syringe. Attach a 33 G needle to the syringe and bend the needle to 20°.\nRemove SO from the anterior chamber.",
    "Intraperitoneally inject 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (0.3 mg/g body weight). Check for the lack of response to the toe pinch to determine the anesthetic strength and the lack of movement of the whiskers or the tail.\nPlace the mouse on a surgery platform and secure it in the lateral position with tape. Apply one drop of 0.5% proparacaine hydrochloride to the cornea to reduce its sensitivity.\nMake two incisions in the temporal quadrant of the cornea between ~2 and 5 o’clock at the edge of the SO droplet using the premade 32 G paracentesis needle.\nInsert a 33 G irrigation needle connected to irrigating solution through one corneal incision, maximum speed.\nInsert another 33 G drainage needle attached to the syringe without a plunger through the other corneal incision to allow the SO droplet to exit the anterior chamber while irrigating with irrigating solution.\nWithdraw the drainage needle, then the irrigation needle.\nInject an air bubble into the anterior chamber to maintain its normal depth and press to close the corneal incision.\nApply antibiotic ointment to both eyes.\nKeep the mouse on the heating recovery pad until fully recovered from the anesthesia.\n4. IOP measurement once a week\nPlace the mouse into an induction chamber perfused with 3% isoflurane mixed with oxygen at 2L/min for 3 min.\nIntraperitoneally inject xylazine and ketamine (0.01 mg xylazine/g, 0.08 mg ketamine/g).\nKeep the cornea moist by applying artificial tears throughout the procedure.\nWait about 15 min to allow the pupil to fully dilate.",
    "Measure the IOP of both eyes using a tonometer according to product instructions. Bring the tonometer near the mouse eye. Keep the distance from the tip of the probe to the mouse cornea at about 3−4 mm. Press the measuring button 6x to generate one reading. Three machine-generated readings are obtained from each eye to acquire the mean IOP.\nSacrifice the animals at 8 weeks after SO injection and perform immunohistochemistry of whole-mount retina, RGC counting, optic nerve (ON) semi-thin sections, and quantification of surviving axons, which have been described before13.\nSubscription Required.
