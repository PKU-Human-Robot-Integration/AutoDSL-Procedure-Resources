    "The human cartilage samples were obtained from patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery of the University Hospital of Tuebingen, Germany, and the Winghofer-hospital, Rottenburg a.N., Germany, for end-stage OA of the knee. Full departmental, institutional, and local ethical committee approval were obtained before commencement of the study (project number 674/2016BO2). Written informed consent was received from all patients before participation. The methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.\n1. Sample preparation\nPreparing the cartilage for cryotome sectioning\n\t\nTo evaluate degenerative changes in the knee joint, take articular cartilage samples obtained from the load-bearing zone of the femoral condyles after tissue resection from the patients.\n\t\tNOTE: Samples that are investigated should still contain at least a thin layer of subchondral bone to allow clear identification of the tissue orientation with respect to the inner and outer surface, thus also allowing a standardized tissue harvest of the topmost cartilage layer. The cartilage can be used for AFM measurements until 24 h after surgery. The tissue can be stored in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 2% (v/v) penicillin-streptomycin and 1.2% (v/v) amphotericin B prior to use. Storing the samples for more than 24 h can cause artifacts in the AFM measurements due to tissue swelling, however.\nCut the articular cartilage as a whole from the subchondral bone with the help of a scalpel and afterwards embed the cartilage sample in water-soluble embedding medium on the cryotome knob that freezes under low temperature in the cryotome device.",
    "NOTE: The frozen medium stabilizes the tissue it envelops. It also results in the freezing of the cartilage sample along with the embedding medium. When cutting the cartilage from the bone, track the orientation of the tissue. The tissue embedded for the cryosections must be placed in such a way that the top layer (i.e., articular surface) of the cartilage faces the blade. Note that the tissue has to be fully covered by the embedding medium.\nCryotome sectioning of the cartilage\n\t\nUsing a standard cryotome, section the tissue at a thickness of 35 µm from the topmost layer (i.e., articular surface) of the articular cartilage that is embedded in the frozen water-soluble embedding medium.\n\t\tNOTE: In total, up to 300 µm (which corresponds to about nine sections) can be sectioned and used for the analyses. The proposed limit of 300 µm corresponds to the visual penetration depth that can usually be obtained with fluorescence microscopy in hyaline cartilage such as articular cartilage. Thus, it is possible to sort cartilage according to the predominant local spatial pattern and then measure these patterns in the corresponding sections.\nCollect the sections on a glass slide and rinse the sections 3x with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the water-soluble embedding medium.\nGluing of cartilage sections onto an AFM compatible Petri dish\n\tNOTE: Because the AFM gathers data by mechanical indentation on the sample, the sections need to be fixed in place to allow for precise measurements.",
    "Gently glue the 35 µm thick sections with biocompatible sample glue onto tissue culture dishes that are compatible with the AFM device. To do this, take 2−3 drops of the glue and put them on the tissue culture dish at the location where the edge of the section will end up. Now put the cartilage section on the glue and allow it to stick firmly to the surface of the tissue culture dish.\n\t\tNOTE: The 35 µm thick sections of hyaline articular cartilage are not very prone to curling. However, if curling occurs when removing the samples from the buffer medium, make sure that as little fluid as possible sticks to the samples. As soon as the excess water has dried up, directly spread the tissue on the dispersed spots of glue so that it is fixed to the surface of the cell culture dish. The glue is applied in a thin layer only at the edges of the sample and not on the entire section. Measure only that portion of the sample that is far from the glued area to eliminate the possibility of the glue interfering with the measurements.\nIncubate the sections at room temperature (RT) for 2 min to allow the glue and tissue to bond properly. Then cover the sections with Leibovitz's L-15 medium without L-glutamine and without Sodium bicarbonate so that they are fully submerged.\n\t\tNOTE: Sudden movements of the sample during fixation or insufficient glue application are common mistakes that result in the tissue’s detachment from the culture dish. Furthermore, applying the Leibowitz medium should be done in a gentle way, so as not to detach the sample from the surface due to \"waves\" created by the medium.",
    "Place the Petri dish with the glued sections in the standard cell culture incubator at 37 °C until measurements are performed.\n\t\tNOTE: Make sure that the tissue sections are stable and do not detach from the surface of the tissue culture dish by performing each step slowly.\n2. Cantilever preparation (gluing the microspheres)\nPreparing the AFM device and diluting the microspheres\n\t\nPlace the cantilever on the glass block specified for air measurements, fix it with the spring, and mount the glass block on the AFM head.\nDilute the microspheres in 100% ethanol (100 particles/10 µL) and ultrasonicate for 10 s, so that the microspheres are separated and do not clump together.\nPreparing the setup for gluing\n\t\nClean a glass slide with 70% ethanol and mount it on the sample holder on the AFM device.\n\t\tNOTE: The cleansing of the slide prevents specks of dust that might interfere with the gluing process from accumulating on the slide's surface.\nPlace 2 µL of the microsphere suspension in the middle of the slide and 2 µL of glue near the microsphere suspension.\n\t\tNOTE: Placing the microsphere suspension and glue close to each other is recommended to allow for a quick transition of the cantilever between the glue and the microspheres. If the transition between dipping the cantilever into the glue and making contact with a microsphere is too long, the glue will eventually harden, thereby losing its adhesive properties.\nLet the ethanol liquid in the microsphere suspension air-dry, leaving the microspheres in place.\nGluing the microspheres on the cantilever tip\n\t\nDip the cantilever manually into the glue with the help of the stepper motor in 10 µm steps until the tip is covered by glue. Perform this step swiftly, as the glue dries fast.",
    "Retract the cantilever again by 100 µm, move it towards the microspheres, and position the cantilever tip directly above a single microsphere.\nRun a force spectroscopy measurement to dip the cantilever tip onto the selected microsphere with the parameters shown in Table 1.\n\t\tNOTE: By executing this step, a measurement of the microsphere's surface is used to establish contact between the cantilever's tip and the microsphere. The relatively long contact time shown in Table 1 allows for ample bonding time between the glue and microsphere. The force-distance curve obtained during this step is generated as a by-product of gluing the microsphere on the cantilever tip and is not processed for further analysis.\nOnce a microsphere is attached to the cantilever, retract the glass block with the cantilever mounted on top and then remove the AFM head from the microscope. Lastly, unmount the glass block and cantilever from the AFM head.\nIncubate the cantilever at 65 °C for 2 h and let it dry overnight at RT before starting the measurements.\n\t\tNOTE: Incubation of the cantilever enhances the glue's adhesive properties, rendering the cantilever-microsphere-complex more stable.\n3. Preparing the AFM device for measurements\nAdjust a glass block specified for measuring in a liquid environment on the AFM holder so that the upper surface is straight and parallel to the AFM holder.\nWith the help of tweezers, carefully mount the selected cantilever on the surface of the glass block, so that the AFM tip with the microsphere protrudes over the polished optical plane.",
    "NOTE: The cantilever's tip needs to protrude over the polished plane in order to be able to reflect the AFM's laser onto the photodetector. Be very careful when placing the cantilever on the AFM so as not to scratch the polished optical surface of the glass block. Scratching the glass block may result in difficulties in adjusting the laser alignment and may interfere with the subsequent measurements.\nBecause the cantilever will be subject to mechanical pressure, it needs to be fixed in place. Stabilize the cantilever on the glass block by sliding the metallic spring into the groove of the block and clamping the top of the cantilever with the spring with the help of tweezers.\nCarefully place the glass block with the cantilever on the AFM head and secure it with the integrated locking mechanism. Make sure that the spring is facing to the left side so that the cantilever is placed in the correct orientation. Then mount the AFM head with the cantilever on the AFM device.\n4. Loading the sample and calibration of the cantilever\nNOTE: Here, calibration of the device is performed by running a force curve on the clean surface of the Petri dish filled with Leibovitz’s medium without any sample tissue. Calibration can also be performed by using a separate control AFM dish filled only with the AFM medium without the sample.\nMounting the sample on the AFM device\n\t\nPlace the Petri dish prepared in step 1.3.3 onto the AFM sample holder.\nTurn on the Petri dish heater and set it at 37 °C. Allow the tissue culture dish to reach optimal temperature (i.e., 20 min).\nPlace a protecting foil on the base of the cantilever assembly to avoid the condensation of medium in the AFM head.\nCalibration of the device",
    "Open the software (Table of Materials), followed by the laser alignment window, and the window depicting the approach parameter settings. Then turn on the stepper motor, the laser light, and the CCD-camera.\nUse the CCD-camera on the microscope to visualize and identify the cantilever. Using the stepper motor function, lower the cantilever in 100 µm steps until the cantilever is fully submerged in the medium.\n\t\tNOTE: The submerging of the cantilever in the liquid is visually identifiable via the CCD-camera. When it breaks the water's surface, the cantilever tip creates easily noticeable circular reflections in the water.\nDirect the laser on top of the cantilever using the adjustment screws.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not overwind the screws, as this will damage the laser alignment mechanism. The cantilever is viewed from below and the laser beam comes from above.\nOnce the laser is positioned on the cantilever, adjust the laser beam with the help of screws in the AFM device so that the reflected beam falls onto the center of the photodetector. Keep monitoring the position of the laser beam using the laser alignment function.\n\t\tNOTE: The detector picks up the deflection of the laser beam reflected by the cantilever and converts it into an electrical signal.\nAfter laser-cantilever adjustment, the Sum signal has to be 1 V or above while the lateral and vertical deflections have to be close to 0. If these values are not obtained, adjust the photodetector.\nObtaining the calibration force curve\n\t\nIn order to reach the surface on the AFM dish to start the measurements, run a scanner Approach with the approach parameters given in Table 2. Once the bottom of the tissue culture dish is reached, retract the cantilever by 100 µm.",
    "NOTE: At this point the probe is exactly 100 µm above from the bottom of the tissue culture dish.\nSet up the RUN parameters and adjust the parameters displayed in Table 3. Click the RUN button to start a measurement and obtain a calibration force-distance curve.\n\t\tNOTE: The force curve obtained here is shown in Figure 1.\nOn the calibration force-distance curve, select the region for a linear fit of the retracted curve in the software.\n\t\tNOTE: The linear fit is done to measure the cantilever’s sensitivity. Once the linear fit is in place, the values will be saved by the software. The spring constant measurement or the thermal noise of the cantilever is calculated by the software afterwards.\nAs the measurements are performed in medium at a temperature of 37 °C, set the temperature variable at 37 °C in the software to mimic physiological conditions as closely as possible.\n\t\tNOTE: By the end of the calibration, the vertical deflection is saved and displayed in the unit of force, the Newton (N), instead of volts (V), which is the unit of the original registration by the photodiode detector.\n5. Biomechanical characterization of the ECM and PCM by performing elasticity measurements via AFM\nIdentifying the chondrocyte patterns in the cartilage section\n\t\nObserve the cartilage section under a phase contrast microscope integrated in the AFM system and identify the specific cellular patterns10 of articular cartilage from the osteoarthritic knee: single strings (healthy tissue areas), double strings (beginning tissue degeneration), small and big clusters (both advanced tissue degeneration). See Figure 2A–D.\nOnce the specific desired pattern is identified, measure two sites per chosen pattern per matrix type (PCM or ECM) and perform nine measurement repetitions on each measurement site (Figure 2E,F). Ensure a sample size large enough to account for possible inaccuracies.",
    "NOTE: For the PCM measurements, place the cantilever in close proximity to the cells (as shown by the red circles in Figure 2E,F). In order to conduct measurements of the ECM, select a region without any cells (shown by the blue area in Figure 2E,F) and perform the indentation as described in step 5.2.\nIndentation of the targeted site\n\t\nPerform an Approach followed by a retraction so that the cantilever is positioned 100 µm above the tissue, which will be the starting position for the subsequent measurements.\nFocus on the PCM or ECM of the pattern to be measured and fix the computer mouse at that point.\n\t\tNOTE: The mouse will serve as a visual marker for the target site of indentation. Once the focus shifts to the cantilever tip, the tissue structures will become indistinguishable or blurred.\nNow focus on the probe and move the tip of the probe to the point previously fixed by the computer arrow. Next, start the measurements with RUN, using the set point parameter obtained by calibration of the cantilever.\n\t\tNOTE: An exemplary force curve obtained from measuring the PCM of a single string is shown in Supplemental Figure 1.\n6. Data processing\nNOTE: The data analysis or determination of the elastic modulus is performed using a Hertz model as described previously11,12. The indenter’s shape was spherical due to the usage of microspheres on the tip and the Poisson’s ratio was kept at 0.5 based on previous literature13,14,15.\nOpen the data processing software (Table of Materials) compatible with the data obtained from the AFM device.\nSelect the Hertz model in the software for processing the force-distance curves. Set the Poisson ratio at 0.5 and select the tip shape as spherical and a tip radius of 12.5 µm.",
    "Once all the parameters are adjusted, the results are fitted, and the Young’s modulus is calculated and displayed by the software.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
