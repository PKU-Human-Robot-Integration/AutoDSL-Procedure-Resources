    "CellMap (http://cellmap.protein.properties[href=http://cellmap.protein.properties]) visualizes proteins by their subcellular localizations on images of cells—optionally provided by the user—users can submit images of cells on the web server and perform the remainder of steps described in this protocol using the image provided. On top, CellMap displays lines (edges) between proteins that interact according to the PPI database HIPPIE (Alanis-Lobato, Andrade-Navarro, & Schaefer, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0001]). This protocol explains (1) where to navigate to open up CellMap; (2) what identifiers are needed to use the system; (3) how to add proteins to the viewer; and (4) how to make the visualization clearer (optional); (5) how to move proteins across localizations (optional); and (6) how to display lines connecting the proteins (optional). We also include an extra step (7) to change the cell image underlying the visualization.\nMaterials\nUsers will need a computer, tablet, or smartphone with an active internet connection. An up-to-date browser is required to operate CellMap. At least for first-time use, we suggest access on a desktop computer through Chrome/Chromium (v50+).\n1. Open the protein-protein interaction view in CellMap by navigating to https://cellmap.protein.properties/ppi[href=https://cellmap.protein.properties/ppi]. Once open, the viewer displays a full-screen image of a cell.\nAlternatively, navigate to the home page of CellMap (https://cellmap.protein.properties[href=https://cellmap.protein.properties]), select “View the maps,” hover over one of the maps, and select “Protein-Protein Interactions.”\n2. Identify proteins of interest: To begin using CellMap, you need an identifier (or accession number) from UniProt [RRID:SCR_002380, (The UniProt Consortium, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0017])] or a primary gene/protein name of one or several proteins of interest.",
    "For the following steps, we use an example introduced by others (Fujiki, Matsuzono, Matsuzaki, & Fransen, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0009]) who describe the role of the Human (NCBI:txid9606) PEX19 (peroxisomal biogenesis factor 19; HGNC:9713; UniProt identifier P40855). When located in the cytosol, PEX19 binds PEX3 (peroxisomal membrane bound peroxisomal biogenesis factor 3; HGNC:8858; UniProt identifier: P56589) (Fabregat et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0007]; May, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0013]).\n3. Add PEX3 (UniProt P56589) to the PPI viewer by inserting the UniProt accession number or gene identifier into the “Search protein” (gray font) input bar found at the center-top of the PPI viewer (results will populate as you type). Once the desired protein is listed in the drop-down list that appears, click on the item in the drop-down list to add the protein to the view. The protein will be displayed as a dot (disk drawn on cell, Figure 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-fig-0001] for PEX3).\nThe color of the dot represents the cellular compartment via a mapping function. The color legend can be found by scrolling down the page and expanding the section “Legend”; alternatively, it can be found at https://cellmap.protein.properties/legend[href=https://cellmap.protein.properties/legend] (Dallago, Goldberg, Andrade-Navarro, Alanis-Lobato, & Rost, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0006]). The viewer uses the UniProt accession, even if queried with the gene/protein name.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c458206d-c07b-4fc9-b3f5-b7354233b211/cpbi97-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nSearching gene PEX3 in the protein-protein interaction viewer and adding its protein product to the view. Right panel: https://cellmap.protein.properties/ppi?p=P56589[href=https://cellmap.protein.properties/ppi?p=P56589]. The exact state (loaded protein in the mitochondrion) can be observed by opening the link provided.",
    "4. Optional: As the cell is in color, users can highlight protein “dots” to enhance visualization by decreasing the cell image opacity while maintaining the intensity of the protein dots (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-fig-0002]). To utilize this feature, click the half-filled star on the left side of the PPI viewer. There are three opacity levels to select from: click the button repeatedly until the desired opacity is found.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c27ecdc8-dc7b-4f89-aa8c-dcd59fb5ecfe/cpbi97-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nFading cell image: 100% visible, 50% visible, 10% visible.\n5. Move PEX3 from one localization to another in the viewer by clicking on the protein dot of P56589 in the mitochondrion. A tool tip with a drop-down menu “New localization” will appear. Select “peroxisome membrane” from the drop-down menu. Once “Peroxisome membrane” is selected, the dot will move from the mitochondrion to the peroxisome membrane (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-fig-0003]). The color of the dot will have changed according to the color legend.\nWhen added to the viewer, proteins will be displayed in their first subcellular compartment [in alphabetical order according to the annotations of localization provided by selected sources (Goldberg et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0010]; Ramilowski et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0014]; The UniProt Consortium, 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0017]; Uhlén et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0019])]. PEX3 (P56589) will be displayed in the mitochondrion, since the possible subcellular localizations are mitochondrion, peroxisome, and peroxisome membrane (Ramilowski et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0014]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c53d4967-450c-4bad-98b2-cce0e9d95864/cpbi97-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nMoving UniProt P56589 (Gene: PEX3) from mitochondrion to peroxisome membrane.\n6. Add an additional protein, PEX19 (UnitProt P40855), to the PPI viewer via the search bar as described in step 3.",
    "7. Display a line between P40855 (PEX19) and P56589 (PEX3) by clicking any of the protein dots in the PPI viewer. Hovering over the dots will display their UniProt identifiers. Clicking on a dot will display a line (edge) between the two proteins along with a floating-point value. The value represents the interaction score according to HIPPIE [the interaction score is the confidence of experimentally measured interactions: from low confidence (0) to high confidence (1) (Alanis-Lobato et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0001])]. Scrolling down the page, a table listing the proteins currently in the view, with their respective subcellular localizations, is presented (“mapped” meaning available on the graphic; “unmapped” meaning not available through the selected graphic; Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-fig-0004]).\nThe full-screen viewer offers several tweaks. Users may add more proteins to the visualization. On the top-right of the map viewer, by hovering over the “layers” icon (a stack of squares piled on one another), users can selectively hide proteins currently loaded onto the view. From the layers, users can also choose to display the annotations of the subcellular localizations by clicking the radio button next to the “localizations” item in the list.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e5f38903-43d5-4fc1-9c8c-bfa3d6bad9ab/cpbi97-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nTable of proteins loaded onto the viewer.\n8. Optional: Users may select a different cell map (cell image) by scrolling down the browser page and clicking on the gray button “Select a different map” at the bottom (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-fig-0004]). This will open a page displaying several images of cells or sections thereof. Users can select one of these maps by hovering over one image and clicking on the “Protein-Protein Interactions” menu item. This will open the new map and load the proteins which were being visualized prior.\n9. Optional: To discard the visualization, click the trashcan icon in the controls to the left of the PPI viewer.",
    "This protocol showcases the display of all known interaction partners of a protein. We will use PEX19 (peroxisomal biogenesis factor 19; HGNC:9713; UniProt identifier P40855) as starting point and visualize its interaction partners according to HIPPIE (Alanis-Lobato et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0001]).\nMaterials\nUsers will need a computer, tablet, or smartphone with an active internet connection. An up-to-date browser is required to operate CellMap. At least for the first-time use, we suggest access on a desktop computer through Chrome/Chromium (v50+).\n1. Navigate to the homepage of CellMap (https://cellmap.protein.properties[href=https://cellmap.protein.properties]) to open a protein-centric page. Utilize the search functionality on this page (second from the top; left panel of Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-fig-0005]) by entering the full or partial UniProt identifier (e.g., P408) or gene name (e.g., pex). The page will populate with squares containing the UniProt identifiers of possible hits. These squares will contain localization data as represented by smaller colored squares on the top left of a protein square, and the number of interaction partners at the bottom right of the protein square. For our example, we type “pex19,” which will display a single result “P40855,” i.e., the protein product of PEX19 in Human (NCBI:txid9606) according to UniProt, which interacts with 234 other proteins (number in lower right of box), and is located in red (cytoplasm) and green (peroxisome) (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-fig-0005]). Clicking in the center of the square will open the protein-centric page.",
    "Throughout CellMap, each localization has a particular color associated to it via a function that maps a string (e.g., “Golgi apparatus”) to a color (in hexadecimal notation, e.g., #A378BF). On the home page, clicking one of the colored squares will filter the results only for proteins that are localized in the selected localization (e.g., clicking on a red square will only display proteins in the “cytoplasm”). For a legend of color-to-localization navigate to https://cellmap.protein.properties/legend[href=https://cellmap.protein.properties/legend].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9f7c4db8-e5e3-45be-acf1-633fea97c64b/cpbi97-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5\nFrom the search for “pex19” on the homepage (https://cellmap.protein.properties/?q=pex19[href=https://cellmap.protein.properties/?q=pex19]) to the protein-centric page of UniProt P40855 (https://cellmap.protein.properties/protein/P40855[href=https://cellmap.protein.properties/protein/P40855]).\n2. To navigate from the protein-centric page for PEX19 (P40855) to the visualization of its interaction partners, scroll to the section titled “Partners” on the protein-centric page. This section gives a graphical preview of PPI partners of the query protein (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-fig-0006], middle panel, top half), as well as a list of squares of interaction partners (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-fig-0006], middle panel, bottom half). Click on the “Expand” link between the preview and the list to open the PPI viewer, similar to what is described in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-prot-0001]. Here, PEX19 (P40855) will be highlighted and all its interaction partners loaded (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-fig-0006], right panel).",
    "Protein-centric pages contain: gene names, full protein name, and the origin of the data at the top of the page; a preview of the localizations of the protein on a map/cell image in the middle of the page; and, following a preview of PPI interaction partners of the protein on a map/cell image at the bottom of the page, the interaction partners (as squares; similar to the search page) of the protein according to HIPPIE (Alanis-Lobato et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0001]). In the last section, like on the search page, interaction partners can be filtered by localization by clicking on the smaller colored boxes inside the squares, and you can navigate to a new protein-centric page by clicking in the center of the square for any protein you see. Additionally, the protein squares contain a floating-point value at the bottom-left representing the confidence score for an interaction between that protein and the protein for which the protein-centric page is open [according to HIPPIE (Alanis-Lobato et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0001])].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/b3de30cb-41d8-40c4-abbe-8d433625b471/cpbi97-fig-0006-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 6\nFrom the protein-centric page of protein P40855 (https://cellmap.protein.properties/protein/P40855[href=https://cellmap.protein.properties/protein/P40855]), to the preview of interaction partners, to the protein-protein interaction visualization of all its partners (https://cellmap.protein.properties/ppi?p=P40855&partners[href=https://cellmap.protein.properties/ppi?p=P40855&partners]).\n3. The one-against-all/pairwise interactions display in the PPI viewer shows all known PPI partners of a query protein, selectable by clicking on any dot in the visualization (PEX19 in Fig. 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-fig-0007], left panel).\nLines (or edges) are colored light gray or black. Black lines represent PPIs that have experimentally been annotated to be binary interactions in the APID database (Alonso-López et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpbi.97#cpbi97-bib-0003]). Light gray lines represent PPIs for which no binary experimental annotation is available, and that might thus not directly interact, as may be the case for proteins in a complex.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/cfff45a8-97d0-45cc-986d-87baecef9d4b/cpbi97-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nOne-against-all and all-against-all protein network visualizations (https://cellmap.protein.properties/ppi?p=P40855&partners[href=https://cellmap.protein.properties/ppi?p=P40855&partners]).",
    "4. To display the all-against-all PPI visualization/complete local PPI network, which displays all known interactions between all of the proteins shown in the map, click on the black filled circle on the left menu of the viewer (below the zoom-in/zoom-out, and above the trashcan icons).\nThis interaction modality may suggest a cascade of events (e.g., ‘A interacts with B’, ‘B interacts with C’, etc.). The complete local PPI network visualization requires some seconds to render for many (>100) interconnected proteins. As noted in the previous step: black lines represent binary PPIs, while light gray lines represent non-binary PPIs.\n5. To navigate the visualization, use the ± buttons on the left-hand controls in the PPI view to zoom in and out, and click-drag the cell image with the mouse to move the focus. This allows one to explore smaller neighborhoods in greater detail and to declutter, at least to some extent, the “hairballs” of greatly connected networks."
