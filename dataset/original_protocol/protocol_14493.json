    "NOTE: All studies presented in this protocol were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Mayo Clinic. The bones were obtained over a period of 6 years from various organizations. All specimens were collected within 72 hours of death, wrapped in saline saturated towels, and stored at -20 °C until preparation.\n1. Measuring Bone Mineral Density Using DXA\nRemove specimens kept at -20 °C freezer to thaw at room temperature for about 24 h; specimens do not need to be removed from original packing if most soft tissue has been removed.\nUse two 5 lb bags of rice to account for soft tissue. Cover the two rice bags on the DXA table with plastic bags to prevent contamination. The rice bags will simulate surrounding soft tissue (in vivo) during scanning as shown in Figure 1.\nProtect the surface of the DXA scanner with plastic lined paper and place 2 plastic wrapped rice bags on the scanner table (Figure 1A).\nLay 2 femora (right and left) on top of rice bags such that the proximal end (including the femoral head) is centered on bags and the posterior side is down (Figure 1B). This mimics a patient lying on their back.\nCover anterior/exposed proximal femur end with additional two 5 lb rice bags (Figure 1C).\nPosition machine head over proximal femur and scan the femur according to the standard institutional procedure for patient BMD measurement (Figure 1C). Follow the specific DXA manufacturer instructions.\n\t\nFrom the DXA machine software interface perform a normal femur scan. Select the femur exam, position the DXA arm on top of the cadaveric femur by pressing on the left or right arrow accordingly on the DXA arm, and start the exam by clicking on the \"start\" button. Perform the BMD analysis by clicking on \"Analyze\".",
    "NOTE: The resulting automatic T-score from the scan classifies the bone as normal, osteopenic or osteoporotic (Figure 1D). Follow the specific DXA manufacturer instructions.\n2. Cleaning, Cutting and Drilling the Distal End of the Bone\nClean the most proximal 300 mm of the femur by carefully removing any remaining soft tissue from the bone. This step is needed to allow PMMA to contact the bone during the potting process in preparation for mechanical testing. The bones need not be thawed to room temperature for this process.\nSanitize the workspace with 70% isopropyl alcohol and cover the table with absorbent paper pads with plastic film on one side (Figure 2A). Set the whole femur on the table (Figure 2B) for the entire process starting with cleaning to cutting (Figure 2A to 2H). Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) including gloves and eye protection.\nScrape off excess periosteum and cut away excess tissue using a scraper and scalpel (Figure 2C, 2H).\nPlace the bone in the custom-made cutting fixture as shown in Figure 2D with the head of the femur against the acrylic plate of the fixture.\nAlign and hold the diaphysis against the two pins on the cutting fixture (Figure 2D).\nSecure the bone to the fixture by tightening down the slotted plate on the diaphysis; if bone does not lie flat on fixture, hang distal end off table top and also optionally zip tie the femoral neck as needed to hold the specimen in place (Figure 2D).\nCut the distal shaft of the femur using the cast cutter (Figure 2E) through slotted plate as a guide; hold bone with a dry rag/towel for better grip.\nRemove the bone from the fixture; normal bone length after cut is 255 mm (Figure 2F).",
    "Clean the medullary cavity of marrow using a curette approximately 25 mm deep. Then, insert a gauze sponge to help dry the interior surface. Remove the gauze just prior to placing the distal end of the femur in the mold. Grip the bone with a dry towel/rag and drill a 10 mm hole through the distal end at approximately 25 mm from the proximal cut end of the specimen. Note: This is to allow the PMMA to penetrate the canal and secure the bone firmly.\n3. Potting the Bone\nDesign and fabricate potting container. The potting containers are made of 5 mm thick acrylic sheets and have the following outer dimensions: 50 mm by 50 mm square cross section and 100 mm tall (Figure 3A).\nLabel potting container with appropriate bone identification (Figure 3A and 3B – see label on acrylic box).\nAdjust the embedding fixture to the proper orientation (left leg or right leg; e.g. 15° or 30° internal rotation).\nPlace potting container in base of embedding fixture, place bone in the potting container (Figure 3B) and align neck with pointer in fixture (Figure 3C) to adjust the internal rotation angle of the bone to the desired value.\nMeasure 60 g of PMMA powder and mix with 30 g of liquid resin under fume hood until the powder has dissolved. The mixture should be pourable. Use a disposable paper cup for this process.\nPour mixture into potting container with bone under a fume hood (Figure 3D), allow to cure for about 10 - 15 min until PMMA is clear and hard. This should only fill ~ 1/2 of the potting container with PMMA. Carefully wrap the bone in saline saturated towels to prevent tissue dryness due to heat generation during PMMA polymerization (Figure 3E).",
    "Periodically check the femur to ensure it remains aligned in the container during curing.\nRemove femur from potting fixture and wrap with a saline soaked paper towel (Figure 3E).\nPrepare 90 g of PMMA under a fume hood as explained in step 3.5 and fill the potting container completely. Cure the PMMA for about 10 - 15 min until it becomes hard.\nAfter resin has cured, tightly wrap/rewrap bone in saline soaked paper towels, cover with plastic bag and store specimens at -20 °C in freezer.\n4. Imaging the Bone with X-ray\n(CAUTION! Operate with proper care for X-ray radiation when using the machine)\nIf using films for X-rays, turn X-ray developer on at least 20 min (per manufacturer instructions) prior to scanning by turning the knob clockwise (in the developer room).\nEnsure there is unexposed film in the cassette before X-raying; cassette should only be opened in a dark room.\nTurn machine on to unlock and extend the machine head.\nPlace a cart under the path of the beam and place a cassette on the cart under the beam (Figure 4A).\nPlace and position the femur on the cassette (Figure 4B); two orientations will be captured: medial-lateral view and anterior-posterior view. Label the specimen images accordingly.\nAfter first exposure, swap the lead and bone locations.\nCover the already exposed half with lead and expose the bone in the second orientation on the unexposed side. This allows the user to use one X-ray film for a single bone in two orientations (Figure 4C-D).\nChange the cassette and rotate each femur into the second orientation.\nIn the case of a single femur, cover half of the cassette with a lead cover to avoid initial exposure of the entire film to X-rays.",
    "Move behind the lead-lined portable wall for personal protection and use the trigger to expose the bones.\nOn completion, return X-ray head to lock and store position, turn key to OFF on X-ray machine and remove exposed X-ray film.\nDevelop the film to obtain X-ray images (Figure 4E) using a regular film developer. Turn on the white light in the room and locate the film developer. Turn on the red light and turn off the white light before opening the cassette and proceed with the film developing process. Open the cassette and put the film through the developer. Turn on the white light and turn off the red light once the film has been developed.\n5. CT Scanning of Bones\nRemove bones from freezer about 24 h prior to scanning. Bones must be completely thawed prior to scanning.\nEnsure the bones are wrapped in plastic bags for scanning to minimize clean-up at the end.\nPlace and secure the femur and the calibration phantom in the CT scanning fixture (Figure 5A-B). The fixture holds the calibration phantom (Figure 5C) and also holds the femur in an orientation (Figure 5D-E) identical with the orientation desired for subsequent mechanical testing. This cross registration is required to use the data from CT scanning (Figure 5F) in the QCT/FEA modeling process (described in a different protocol).\n\tNOTE: The fixture is designed such that it exposes the femur for CT scanning without obstructing the proximal femur (femoral head, neck, greater trochanter, and proximal shaft).",
    "Make sure the fixture along with the femur in the CT scanner is properly aligned using the system lasers as guides (Figure 5D-E). Re-check the alignment of the fixture with the CT long axis laser (by pressing laser on/off button). The phantom does NOT need to be aligned with the laser as it is secured in the fixture. Zero the table position from the control panel of the machine by pressing the zero button (→ 0 ←) on the control panel.\nFollowing CT standard operating procedure, operate the CT machine at 120 kVp, 216 mAs, 1 s rotation time, and pitch of 1 using ultra high resolution mode (zUHR). This gives a slice thickness of 0.4 mm, and a pixel size of 0.30 - 0.45 mm depending on the size of the field of view (FOV).\nCheck CT-scan data prior to mechanical testing to ensure that images of interest are captured and saved. Refreeze the bone at -20 °C until the day of the experiment.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
