    "The procedures below have been ethically approved by Imperial College, London.\n1. Generation of Primary Mammospheres from Human Breast Cancer Cell Lines\nNOTE: Perform the following steps under a sterile culture hood.\nPrepare Mammosphere Media containing DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 U/ml streptomycin. Prepare complete media immediately before use by adding 20 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF; Sigma), 10 ng/ml recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; R&D Systems) and 1x B27 supplement.\nAspirate media from flask containing adherent MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells (or a breast cancer cell line of your choice; 70-80% confluence), wash twice in 1x PBS, and trypsinize cells.\nCentrifuge cells at 200 x g at room temperature for 5 min. Decant supernatant and resuspend cells in 1-5 ml of mammosphere media. Pipette up and down and if necessary use a 40 µm cell strainer cap filter to obtain single-cell suspension. Use a hemocytometer to ensure a single cell suspension has formed (if not, use a 25 G needle to syringe the cell suspension up to 3 times).\nIf necessary isolate CD44+CD24- cellular subset via FACS using anti-CD24-phycoerythrin (PE) and anti-CD44-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) monoclonal antibodies9. Alternatively, isolate such population using a magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) system with anti-CD44 and anti-CD24-biotin combined microbeads as per manufacturer’s instructions. Perform positive selection using LS columns, and negative selection using LD columns and confirm the phenotypes of all isolated cells by flow cytometry17.\nCalculate the number of viable cells per ml using trypan blue.\n\tNOTE: Cell viability is calculated as the number of viable cells divided by the total number of cells within the grids on the hemocytometer. Cells that take up trypan blue are considered non-viable. The following procedure is used to accurately determine proportion of viable cells.",
    "Prepare a 0.4% solution of trypan blue in PBS. Add 0.1 ml of trypan blue stock solution to 1 ml of cells. Load a hemocytometer and examine immediately under a microscope at low magnification. Count the number of total cells and the number of blue staining cells.\n\t\tViable cells = [1.00 – (Number of blue cells ÷ Number of total cells)] × 100.\nTo calculate the number of viable cells per ml of culture, use the formula below. Remember to correct for the dilution factor.\n\t\tNumber of viable cells × 104 × 1.1 = cells/ml culture\nResuspend a pre-determined amount of cells in 2 ml of complete mammosphere media in each well of a 6-well ultra-low adherent plate. The seeding density is normally 500-4,000 cells/cm2 cell per well. Optionally use low attachment 24-well plates while seeding cells at the same density in 0.5 ml of media.\n\tNOTE: We recommend optimization of seeding density and time of culture for each cell lines of interest.\nIncubate ultra low-attachment 6-well plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5-10 days (depending on the cell line and the size of mammospheres) without disturbing the plates, particularly during the growth phase of the first 5 days.\n2. Generation of Primary Mammospheres from Human Breast Cancer Clinical Samples\nNOTE: Human breast cancer tissue can be obtained from patients undergoing surgery for the removal of breast tumors. Store tissue on ice for up to 24 hr in 50 ml sterile tubes in culture media containing 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 U/ml streptomycin. Perform the following steps under a sterile culture hood.\nTransfer the sample into a 100 mm tissue Petri dish with a small volume of media. Remove the adipose tissue using sterile scissors, scapel and tweezers.",
    "Add 2-3 ml of DMEM/F12 and mince the sample into 1 mm3 pieces with a sterile scapel or razor blade until no large pieces remain.\nResuspend the tissue pieces in pre-warmed 10 ml DMEM containing proteolytic enzymes (3,000 U/ml collagenase and 1,000 U/ml hyaluronidase) and incubate at 37 °C in a rotary shaker until all the tissue fragments are digested. Usually complete digestion takes from 1-3 hr. Adjust the digestion time according to pathological characters of tumors. (For example breast adenocarcinoma is usually harder to digest compared to mucinous carcinoma which is more fragile and needs shorter digestion time). Assess the degree of digestion every ½ hour by observing 20 µl suspension under hemocytometer.\nAllow the fragments to sediment for 5 min, then transfer the supernatant in a 15 ml conical polypropylene tube and centrifuge at 200 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Carefully decant off the supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 - 5 ml of mammosphere media.\nFollow the steps 1.1-1.4 described above for cell lines to obtain and plate single cell suspensions. Pass cells through the 25 G syringe a maximum of 2 times if necessary to limit damaging cells.\n3. Mammosphere Forming Efficiency (%) Calculation\nAfter the culture period, count the mammospheres (greater than 40 µm) diameter under a microscope at 40X magnification. Digitally image 5 random fields using a digital camera on a light microscope and determine the mammospheres size using the acquisition software. Use any Image Analysis Software.\nCalculate Mammosphere Forming Efficiency (MFE%) using the following equation:\nMFE (%) = (# of mammospheres per well) / (# of cells seeded per well) x 100\n4. Serial Passaging of Mammospheres for Assessment of Self-renewal",
    "Pipette the media containing the mammospheres from each well into a 15 ml tube. Wash the wells with PBS and add to the collected media. Centrifuge at 115 x g for 10 min at room temperature.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 500 µl of pre-warmed 0.5% trypsin/0.2% EDTA. Incubate for 2-3 min.\nAdd 500 µl of FCS to neutralize trypsin. Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min. Discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 100 µl of mammospheres media, pipetting up and down to disaggregate spheres.\nCount cells with hemocytometer and determine if cells are in single cell suspension. If not pass through a 25 G syringe up to 3 times to obtain single cells. Seed the cells into a new ultra low-attachment 6-well plate at the same density used in the primary generation.\nAfter 5-10 days, count spheres >40 µm and calculate sphere-forming efficiency using the formula reported before.\nSubscription Required.
