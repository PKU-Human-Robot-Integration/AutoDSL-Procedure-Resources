    "Part I: ACSF Recirculation System Assembly Assembly of the Micropump Control CircuitFor a simplified schematic with color-coded cables refer to Figure 2A. For detailed, step-by step photos of the assembly of the circuit, consult Figures 4-14. For a table listing all the connections required for the mp6 micropump control circuit, see Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191005/20191005012022_9804.jpgFigure 3.

Steps 1-4 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.To fit all the necessary components, a breadboard with 3 terminal strips and 63 rows of 10 tie points per terminal strip is required (Figure 4). Such breadboards include the Digilent 340-002-1 or the Wisher WBU-206. Each of these has 5 power distribution buses and 3 terminal strips. Remove (unscrew) the rightmost distribution bus and the adjacent terminal strip.Attach with screws or Velcro pads the two Arduinos–ideally in a staggered fashion to allow easy access to the two USB ports, as shown in Figure 4.Connect the 5 Volt DC Power Supply to the horizontal distribution bus of the breadboard (Figure 4, designated by the red “plus” and the black “minus” signs). Include a simple toggle SPST push button “master switch” (not shown), for switching the power supply to the circuit.Connect the power and ground of all vertical distribution buses to 5 V and ground, respectively, of the horizontal distribution bus (Figure 4)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190926/20190926003835_7103.jpgFigure 5. Steps 5-6 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.On the middle (now rightmost) terminal strip attach the two 10K-Ohm potentiometers, and connect them to power and ground, as shown in Figure 5.",
    "Note: The screws that rotate the wiper and vary the resistance in each potentiometer should be facing away from each other, therefore allowing enough clearance for the mini screwdriver that will be used to make adjustments in Step 6. Using a mini screwdriver, adjust voltage to get 1.3 V across the wiper of the top potentiometer and 1.8 V across the bottom.Note: For safety, you should disconnect the power supply when proceeding with the next steps of the protocol.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190926/20190926003904_2129.jpgFigure 6. Steps 7-8 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.On the terminal strip that includes the two potentiometers also install the two 8-channel logic level converters (Figure 6). Connect VCCB on each logic level converter to 5 V and GND to ground (Figure 6; also refer to Figure 2A for pinout diagram and voltage information).Connect VCCA and OE on the top logic level converter to 1.3 V and on the bottom converter to 1.8 V (see gray jumper wires in Figures 6; also refer to Figure 2A for voltage and pin information).Attach the 26-pin Assembled Pi Cobbler Breakout Board. Use the shield stacking headers to elevate the Breakout Board, and therefore allow enough clearance for the third and fourth mp6-OEM controllers that will be attached next (Step 10) and are directly adjacent to the Breakout Board (see Figure 15D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190926/20190926003931_9834.jpgFigure 7. Steps 9-14 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.Connect the six mp6-OEM controllers to the leftmost terminal strip of the breadboard as shown in Figure 7 (also refer to Figure 2A).",
    "Note: The bottom two mp6-OEM controllers will supply the inflow lines (perfusing the top and bottom sides of the mesh) of the bath of the interface chamber, and their flow rate is adjustable by the bottom Arduino Uno, which is connected to Pin 2 (Cyan, added in Step 22) (Figure 2, and Figures 15A and 15B). The top four OEMs are connected to the four-pump array that supplies the suction (Figure 15C), and their flow rate is constant (set at maximal). For these OEMs, Pin 2 and Pin 3 are shorted and do not receive any input from the bottom Arduino Uno (Figure 2A). Also notice that in all six of the OEMs Pin 5 and Pin 10 are unused. Short Pins 11 and 12 on all six mp6-OEMs, using U-shaped loops made out of cut jumper wires, long enough to connect two contacts on adjacent breadboard rows (see six-pointed asterisks in Figure 7; refer to Figure 2A for numbering of pins).Similarly, short Pins 2 and 3 of the top four OEMs (see five-pointed asterisks in Figure 7; refer to Figure 2A for numbering of pins).Connect the ground (Black) to Pin 1, marked with a white spot of all six mp6-OEMs (Figure 7; refer to Figure 2A for numbering of pins).Connect 5 V (Red) to Pin 14 of all six mp6-OEMs, as shown in Figure 7 (refer to Figure 2A for numbering of pins).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190926/20190926003953_6420.jpgFigure 8.

Step 21 of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.Connect Inputs B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6 of the top logic level converter to Digital Pins 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, respectively, of the top Arduino Uno, as shown in Figure 12 (White cables).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190926/20190926004218_1657.jpgFigure 13.

Step 23 and complete overview of the assembly of the mp6 micropump control circuit. See text for details.Connect Outputs 9 and 10 (PWM0 and PWM1) of the bottom Arduino Uno to Pin 2 (Cyan) of the bottom two OEMs (Figure 14).",
    "Connect one of the Digital outputs of the ADC to TX 1 and GDN of the top Arduino Uno (Figure 2A). This connection will turn on and off the recirculation perfusion controlled by the mp6 pumps, as directed by the winLTP Program.Connect the two Arduino Uno units to the computer, using USB connection. Connect the GDN of the bottom Arduino to the central ground of the electrophysiology rig. (Figure 2A. The top Arduino is grounded via the ADC ground—see Step 24).Copy and load into the top Arduino controlling all six micropumps (Microcontroller 1) the program shown in Figure 18.Copy and load into the bottom Arduino controlling the two inflow micropumps (Microcontroller 2) the program shown in Figure 19. Assembly of the mp6 micropump array (see reference 29)Assemble the six cables connecting the six Molex connectors (one per mp6 micropump) to the Breakout Board 26-pin ribbon cable, as shown in Figures 2B and 15E. The color scheme of Figures 2B and 2C serves as a guide. Use four male gold-plated pins and a 32AWG 4-wire multi-conductor cable (e.g., the MC001 Alpha Wire Multi-Conductor Cable) to connect the four pins of the Molex connector to the ribbon cable. Each Molex connector and associated multicolor cable will be inserted into four sockets of the ribbon cable (wire arrangement, clockwise from top left socket: brown, purple, blue, green; repeat for all six Molex connectors). Only 24 (6 x 4) out of the 26 sockets of the ribbon cable will be used.Note: Disregard the colors of the Alpha Wire multicolor cables in Figures 15A, 15B, 15C, 15E and 15F, which are unrelated to the color scheme of Figure 2B.",
    "Position both components as indicated in Figure 2C, the mp6/mp6-pp facing upwards (with its company logo and serial number markings visible from above), and the Molex connector with the four small openings facing down. Then slide the mp6/mp6-pp flex into the Molex connector. Clamp the Molex connector to complete the connection between both components.Manufacture three custom-made plexiglass spacers similar to the ones shown in Figures 15A and 15B. Also prepare cork pads cut to size in order to compensate for differences in the thickness of the micropump and the Molex connectors.Make an assembly consisting of two mp6 micropumps as shown in Figures 15A (front) and 15B (side) as follows: First, glue the marked side of micropump 1 (mp6-1) on the plexiglass spacer using double-sided adhesive tape. Glue cork pads to the unmarked side of the first micropump. The order of parts in the resulting component is: plexiglass/mp6-1/cork.Repeat these steps for micropump 2 (mp6-2), but in the opposite order, i.e., with the cork pad glued to marked side and the plexiglass spacer on the unmarked. The order of parts in the resulting component is: cork/mp6-2/plexiglass.Build a four mp6 micropump assembly (Figure 15C) consisting of the two plexiglass spacer/mp6/cork pad components, by placing the third (unglued) plexiglass spacer in between, so that order of parts in the completed array is:plexiglass/mp6-1/cork/plexiglass/cork/mp6-2/plexiglass.The resulting assembly can be held together either with pieces of double-sided adhesive tape, or by a clamp, or with long screws that pass through drilled holes into the plexiglass spacers. In the latter case, make sure to tap threads into the holes of only one out of the three spacers.Make mini-Faraday cages out of copper wire mesh (Figure 15F) to allow the elimination of the noise generated by the piezoelectric micropumps (see Note 3).",
    "Ground the mini Faraday cages on the main ground of the airtable.The completed assemblies consist of either two or four mp6 micropumps (Figure 15F). As discussed above, four pumps connected in parallel are required for the suction, and two pumps with independent inlets and outlets perfuse the top and bottom of the hippocampal slice, from both sides of the mesh in the recording chamber.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190926/20190926004325_8315.jpgFigure 15. Different views of the assembled micropump arrays and associated components. A and B. Two mp6 micropumps are stacked in parallel connection, which causes their volume flows to summate. Each such “sandwich” array consists of three custom-made plexiglass panels, one of which is threaded so that screws can hold the assembly together. Cork pads cut to size allow for precise contact of different surfaces. C. Two assemblies shown in (A) and (B) stacked on top of each other, constitute the pump array that controls the suction. Notice the y connectors and mp-cv valves. D. The 26-pin Assembled Pi Cobbler Breakout Board is connected to 26-pin shield stacking headers with longer pins, so as to allow enough clearance for two of the mp6-OEM controllers that are attached directly adjacent to it. E. Cable that connects six micropumps to the Pi Cobbler Breakout Board. F. Mini-Faraday cages made of copper wire mesh to allow grounding the noise from the pumps. Note: Alpha Wire multiconductor cables have their own color scheme which is unrelated to the color scheme of Figures 2B, 2C, 9 and 11.Part II: Rodent Hippocampal Slice PreparationPrepare Dissection and Recording Solutions: Prepare two stock 10x ACSF solutions, one for dissection (Dissection 10x ACSF) and one for recording (Recording 10x ACSF). Maintain the two stock 10x ACSF solutions at 4 °C until the day of the experiment.",
    "On the day of the experiment, prepare 1x Dissection ACSF and 1x Recording ACSF.Oxygenate both solutions for at least 20 min at room temperature with 95% O2/5% CO2.Reducing the temperature of the slice helps prevent ischemic damage (see Note 2). To rapidly chill room-temperature 1x Dissection ACSF Buffer to an appropriate cold temperature without freezing the buffer, place it into a -70 °C freezer for 45 min. If ice crystals form, remove them with a small spoon or sieve to avoid contact with, and possible damage to the brain tissue. After removing from the freezer continue to oxygenate the Dissection ACSF with 95% O2/5% CO2 at 4 °C.Prepare the interface electrophysiology rig: Heat the water jacket of the interface chamber so that the temperature of the recording chamber is 31.5 °C. Preheat 250-500 ml of the 1x Recording ACSF by placing it in a 32 °C water bath while oxygenating with 95% O2/5% CO2. The purpose of preheating the solution to a temperature slightly above the temperature of the recording chamber is to prevent the formation of bubbles in the tubes and under the mesh when the solution is heated again after passing from the heat jacket. Start perfusing the bath with 1x Recording ACSF, at a flow rate of 500 μl/min.Deeply anesthetize the animal in the anesthesia chamber, using an Isoflurane vaporizer: Apply 100% O2 for 2 min, followed by 100% O2 + 1.5% Isoflurane for 1 min, followed by 100% O2 + 2.5% Isoflurane for 2 min.When the animal is deeply anesthetized, decapitate it with a small animal guillotine. Submerge the decapitated head inside a metal surgical tray sitting on ice in an icebox and filled with oxygenated ice-cold 1x Dissection ACSF.",
    "Note: Following the decapitation of the animal, the preparation of the brain slices should be completed within less than 10 min. Quickly remove the brain: expose the skull by making an incision with a single edge razor blade on the scalp.Using a pair of surgical scissors with their sharp pointed blade working along the inner side of the skull, cut along the sagittal suture from the foramen magnum to the forehead.Using the surgical scissors, make one cut at the foramen magnum on each temporal side of the skull, then cut across the frontal bone along the coronal suture. Carefully pry the skull open with a rongeur and expose the brain.Holding the skull upside down, sever the cranial nerves that hold the brain to the skull using a spatula and allow the brain to fall into a 50 ml beaker containing ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF.Using an icebox, transfer the beaker with the brain to a 4 °C cold room.Isolate the hippocampus: use a 90 mm Pyrex Culture Petri Dish covered with a moistened filter paper as a dissecting platform.Place the chilled brain on the platform and bisect it along the longitudinal fissure. Place the right hemibrain in a 50 ml beaker containing ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF.To isolate the hippocampus of the left hemibrain, sever what remains of the midbrain and brain-stem using a flat spatula. Scoop out the thalamus to expose the ventral face of the hippocampus nested inside the cortex and clearly visible as a curved structure. Sever the septal and temporal connections of the hippocampus from the cortex with a spatula. Using a filled plastic Pasteur pipet, gently squeeze a few droplets of ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF into the pocket of the lateral ventricle to distinguish the border of the fimbria.",
    "Gently insert into the lateral ventricle a fine brush moistened with ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF and roll the hippocampus out gently from the surrounding cortex. Isolate the peeled-out hippocampus by cutting it free from the cortex using a flat spatula. Place the left hippocampus in a 20 ml beaker with ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF.Repeat previous steps with right hippocampus.Slicing: The slicing stage should be prepared in advance and can be reused multiple times. It consists of a circular thin piece of cork pad of equal diameter to the plastic disc of the McIlwain tissue chopper and glued on it with parallel pieces of double-sided adhesive tape. The clamps of the McIlwain tissue chopper dissection platform can be adjusted to match the thickness of the slicing stage (Figure 16C).Place a piece of filter paper on the slicing stage and moisten it with chilled oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF.Using a fine brush (or a spatula with its flat side bent at right angles) gently lift the hippocampus from the bottom of the beaker.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190926/20190926004401_9548.jpg Figure 16. Photographs showing proper positioning of the left rat hippocampus on the McIlwain tissue chopper dissection platform (refer to text for details)Lay the isolated hippocampus on the slicing stage with its top side up (the dorsal face containing the alveus). It is often possible to view striations on the alvear surface of this side, with oblique light from a fiber optic. Using the brush gently straighten the bottom surface of the hippocampus so that it lies completely flush on the moistened filter paper.Only the dorsal hippocampus will be sliced from each side. To immobilize the hippocampus, one may therefore affix the ventral hippocampus (the thicker end) on the cork of the slicing stage with an insect pin (Figure 16A).",
    "Slide the slicing stage with the affixed hippocampus through the clamps of the McIlwain tissue chopper dissection platform (Figure 16C).Rotate the slicing stage on the platform so that the dorsal hippocampus is properly oriented with respect to the razor blade: the blade should make a 15° angle with the transverse axis of the dorsal hippocampus (Figures 16B, 16C). Excitatory pathways are better preserved when an angle of 15 to 30° from this axis is used (Alger et al., 1984). In general, the alvear striations will tend to run parallel to the blade at this orientation. If the hippocampus on the left hemibrain is used, it will look like an upright “U” as viewed from above with the dorsal hippocampus on the right and the (pinned) ventral hippocampus on the left (Figures 16A-16C). To achieve the proper cutting angle, rotate the slicing stage 15° counterclockwise. Similarly, if the right hippocampus is used, it will resemble an inverted “U”, and the stage is rotated 15° clockwise.Wet the blade with ACSF and make the slices by lowering the blade through the hippocampus. Each slice should stick on the wet surface of the blade as it ascends. The first 3 (most dorsal) complete slices are usually discarded. Depending on the age of the animal, 6 to 8 slices of 450 mm thickness can be obtained from rats (Figure 16B) and 4-5 such slices from mice. The speed and the strength of impact of the blade should be adjusted so that the slices are cut gently, but quickly enough to avoid sticking of the uncut hippocampus on the ascending blade. The blade should not slam on the surface of the cutting stage; ideally it should just dimple the surface of the wet filter paper on the chopping stage.",
    "Quickly remove the slices from the blade as they are produced using a moistened fine sable brush. Immediately after making each slice, transfer it to a test tube filled with ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF. Take great care to avoid stretching or excessively bending the slices during handling. One method is to pick the slices from the blade with the brush premoistened with ice-cold oxygenated 1x Dissection ACSF, using a gentle rolling motion. Some of the ACSF moisture on the brush will also stick on the blade and help the next slice stick to the blade after it has been sliced off the hippocampus.Immediately after making the slices, transfer them to the interface recording chamber to recover for at least 2 h. The slices should rest on a mesh at the gas-liquid interface, forming a small meniscus around them (Figures 17A, 17B and 17C), and should be constantly superfused from both their top and bottom side with (non-recirculating) 1x Recording ACSF, at a flow rate of 500 μl/min.Note: Please also consult the following video articles offering detailed information on acute hippocampal slice preparation for long-term recordings: Villers and Ris (2013); Shetty et al. (2015).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190926/20190926004430_5650.jpgFigure 17. Photographs showing proper positioning of a rat hippocampal slice in an Oslo-type interface recording chamber. A. The slice lies on a mesh, near the wall of a recording bath. The chamber has two such recording baths, both of which are covered by a removable convex canopy that creates a humidified, oxygen-rich atmosphere above the slice. The canopy has a triangular opening that allows recording from each slice individually (while the slice in the other bath remains covered).",
    "Each slice is constantly superfused with ACSF flowing into the bath through an inflow tube and out through an outflow conduit (across from the inflow), which leads to the suction well (the suction is provided by a yellow syringe needle). B and C. At interface, a small meniscus is formed around the slice. A larger meniscus is formed around the walls of the bath.Part III: Application of oligodeoxynucleotides to slices in recirculation modeIn ODN experiments, after recovery from dissection in interface mode, increase the bath level to fully submerge the slices and allow the superfusate containing 20 μM of the oligodeoxynucleotide to recirculate (5 ml total volume at 5 ml/min for 30 min). To achieve this, follow these steps:Copy and load the program of Figure 18 on the top Arduino of Figure 14 (“Microcontroller 1” in Figure 2A). Change the value of “delay” to “1800000”, save the new program and reload to top Arduino. Upon activation by the digital output of ADC via the winLTP program, the top Arduino will turn on all six of the micropumps for 30 min.Load the Arduino PWM library (see link) and copy and load the program of Figure 19 on the bottom Arduino of Figure 14 (“Microcontroller 2” in Figure 2). Change the “int32_t clockfrequency” value to “200”, save the new program and reload to the bottom Arduino. Upon activation by the digital output of the ADC via the winLTP program, the bottom two pumps will supply a flow rate of 5 mL/min (Figure 20) to the inlets of the recording chamber (the four ouflow pumps of the suction, once on, will always operate at maximum flow rate).Turn off the peristaltic pump, and at the same time turn off the vacuum suction.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190926/20190926004511_0537.jpgFigure 18.",
    "Arduino program that activates simultaneously all six mp6 oems and keeps them active for a designated period. The program allows turning all six of the mp6 micropumps on simultaneously when prompted by one of the digital outputs of the ADC, which is in turn controlled by the “Slow0 Perfusion Change” function of the winLTP program. By changing the “delay” value (highlighted in yellow) the slices can be perfused for variable intervals. In this particular example the pumps will remain on for 1800000 ms (i.e., 30 min).Turn on the piezoelectric pump circuit using the SPST push button master switch. Use a three-way valve to manually switch between the peristaltic pump drawing solution from a main reservoir (typically a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask held inside a water bath with a clamp) and the two-micropump assembly of the bath inlet, which should be drawing solution from a 15 ml conical tube containing the recirculating solution with the ODN (inside the same water bath as the main reservoir).Start the winLTP program with Sequential Protocol Scripting and Automated Perfusion Control (Anderson et al., 2012; see also Chapter 10 of the WinLTP software manual (Anderson, 2018). Note: The automated perfusion control is currently only supported by National Instruments M- or X-Series ADC boards). Use the Slow0 Perfusion Change for controlling one perfusion line to one extracellular slice chamber.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190926/20190926004537_2635.jpgFigure 19. Arduino program that performs pulse width modulation (PWM). The program allows changing the frequency of the signal generated by the mp6-OEM from the default value, to reduce the mp6 micropump flow volume from its maximum value (5.5 ml/min). The frequency of the OEM signal is altered by changing the value of “int32_t clockfrequency” (highlighted in yellow). The current value “int32_t clockfrequency = 75” yields a flow rate of approximately 2.5 ml/min (see Figure 20).",
    "Note: Library download link: https://code.google.com/archive/p/arduino-pwm-frequency-library/downloads[href=https://code.google.com/archive/p/arduino-pwm-frequency-library/downloads].Note: The digital output from the National Instruments M- or X-Series board is connected to Arduino 1, and it will activate both the assembly consisting of the two independent micropumps that control the inlets to the bath, as well as the multipump array that controls the suction. Make sure the tube at the output of the aspirator leads the solution back to the 15 ml conical tube to complete the recirculation circuit.  If necessary, adjust the height of the suction tube in the suction well of the chamber to raise the bath level and fully submerge the slice.After 30 min of recirculation in the submersion mode and to begin recording, lower the bath level of the ODN-containing solution by lowering the aspirator tube to interface level and return the flow rate to 0.5 ml/min for the remainder of the experiment by changing the “int32_t clockfrequency” value from 200 to 10, and loading again the program of Figure 19 to the Bottom Arduino Uno.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190926/20190926004604_7670.jpgFigure 20. Changing the flow rate of single mp6 micropump by pulse-width modulation (PWM). By inserting different values for “int32_t clockfrequency” (x-axis of the graph), the flow rate (y-axis) can be changed from the low rates of a few hundred microliters per min (shown in the insert) required for interface chamber recordings, to a maximal flow rate of 5.5 ml/min.Place stimulating and recording electrodes in the hippocampal layers of interest and begin electrophysiological recordings.For experiments to study long-term synaptic plasticity lasting many hours, record field EPSPs (fEPSPs) with a glass extracellular recording electrode (2-5 MΩ) placed in the CA1 stratum radiatum, with concentric bipolar stimulating electrodes placed on either side within CA3 or CA1. Exclude from study slices if initial analysis shows fEPSP spike threshold < 2 mV.",
    "Confirm independence between the two stimulated pathways by the absence of paired-pulse facilitation between the two pathways. Set the baseline fEPSP at 25% of the spike threshold and monitor it by delivering stimuli at 0.033 Hz to each pathway. Induce LTP by strong HFS, consisting, for example, of standard two 100 Hz-1s tetanic trains, spaced 20 s apart, which is optimized to produce a relatively rapid onset of protein synthesis-dependent late-LTP (Tsokas et al., 2005; Tsokas et al., 2016, Hsieh et al., 2017). For rat hippocampal slices deliver the tetanus at 70% of the spike threshold (Tsokas et al., 2005; Hsieh et al., 2017), and for mouse slices use 25% of the spike threshold (Tsokas et al., 2016). The maximum slope of the rise of the fEPSP can be analyzed on a PC using the WinLTP data acquisition program (Anderson and Collingridge, 2007)."
