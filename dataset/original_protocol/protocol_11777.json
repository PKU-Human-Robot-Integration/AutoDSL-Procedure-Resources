    "All procedures were approved by the Italian Ministry of Health and local Animal Use Committee and were conducted in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the European Community Council Directives.\nNote: Figure 6 shows a timeline of the entire procedure of the protocol to test ID/ED task.\n1. Apparatus\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53503/53503fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. The two-chamber \" Operon \" apparatus. (A) View from the top of the entire apparatus and (B) view from the front of a single chamber mimicking the mouse point-of-view during the test. 1: visual stimuli (LEDs); 2: food magazine; 3: nose-poke hole; 4: tactile stimulus (texture); 5: olfactory stimulus; 6: automatic sliding door; 7: house-light; 8: infrared photobeam for door control. Chambers (16 x 16 x 16 cm3) are separated by a transparent plastic door (6). Infrared photobeams (8) tracked the animal movements and controlled the opening/closing of the automatic door to allow the mouse to change chambers. Each chamber presents two nose-poke holes (3) with infrared photobeams, and, between them, a food magazine (2) with photobeams where a pellet dispenser delivered the food reinforcement. A house-light (7) is located above each of the two food magazines. Each nose-poke hole is equipped with a series of changeable stimuli that could vary in three different perceptual dimensions (odor, view, tact).

    "Note: The Operon apparatus (Figure 1) consists of two identical chambers with Plexiglas walls and an aluminum floor (16 x 16 x 16 cm3 for each chamber). Chambers are separated by a transparent Plexiglas dividing door that can be automatically controlled to allow the mouse to access either chamber. Each chamber has two nose-poke holes with infrared photobeams, and, between them, a food magazine with photobeams where a pellet dispenser delivered the food reinforcement. A fan and a house-light are located above each of the two food magazines.\nEquip each nose-poke hole with a number of changeable stimuli (Table 1) that vary in three different perceptual dimensions (i.e., odor, sight, tactile). Note: The stimuli suggested in Table 1 have been selected in order to avoid any confounding factor and/or bias due to avoidance or preference. Five pairs of exemplars for each dimension allow a within-subject testing of all shifts, with novel stimuli at every shift.\n\t\nTo deliver olfactory stimuli into the nose-poke holes, use a dilution olfactometer, which condition incoming air to the nose-poke holes by automatically desiccating, filtering, rehydrating and controlling the presentation of pairs of scents.\n\t\t\nUse one olfactometer to control two nose-poke holes. Regulate airflow by an air pump and a vacuum for the removal of the scent in the nose-poke holes. Connect the air pump to the inlet of the olfactometer and the vacuum to the outlets mounted on the nose-poke device. Then connect the outlet for odor delivery to each nose-poke inlet. Adjust the flow rate to 1.5 L per minute.\nDilute odor scents 1:20 in mineral oil and fill the bottles of the olfactometer.",
    "For visual stimuli, place light-emitting diodes (LED) on top of each nose-poke hole and secure them in the metal panel of the chamber (see details in Figure 1 and Table 1). Connect them to the output interface.\nFor tactile stimuli, mount changeable floor textures in front of each nose poke hole. Mount the different textures on sliding support and move them using frames underneath the floor, so that they are presented in correspondence of a small opening (3 x 3 cm2) on the floor in front of each nose-poke hole.\nControl the presentation of the stimuli using software according to manufacturer's instructions in order to automatically change the stimuli of different dimensions during the experiment.\nPlace a camera on the top of the apparatus in order to record basal alternation and locomotor activity using behavioral monitoring software (e.g., Ethovision, Anymaze), which might help to eliminate animals that have problems unrelated to cognitive functions.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nODORS,TEXTURES,LIGHTS\npeach v. sage,velcro v. film,lights on v. lights off\nvanilla v. lavender,coarse sandpaper v. fine sandpaper,red v. green\nstrawberry v. cinnamon,smooth cardboard v. ridged cardboard,blue v. yellow\ngrapefruit v. oregano,sponge v. smooth plastic,orange v. white\nlemon v. apricot,honeycomb paper v. aluminium foil,fix lights v. blinking lights\nTable 1.

Animal Preparation\nNote: The representative results reported here were obtained from male C57BL/6J mice, 3 to 7 months old, during the light phase.",
    "Weigh the mice, singly-house and then handle for 1 min on three alternate days.\nAfter one week of acclimation to single-housing, record body weight and 24-hr food intake for three consecutive days to determine the baseline weight and food intake.\nApply a slight food deprivation regimen for 1 week before training for the test. Check the animals' weight every day while food restricted throughout the experiment in order to maintain about 90% of their baseline free-feeding body weight. For three consecutive days before the habituation training phase, give mice in their home cage also ≈20 food reinforcement pellets. These are the food pellets that will be used in subsequent testing.\n\tNote: Food restriction is used to increase the animals' motivation to work in the task, however, do not exceed 10% of weight loss during any phase of the whole procedure as it may lead to abnormal behaviors and excessive stress for the mice, which may affect the results.\n\t\nAlternatively, in order to avoid single housing, leave the mice group-housed (2 to 4 each cage) and give access to ad libitum food for a specific period of time after testing. Check the animals' weight every day while food restricted throughout the experiment in order to maintain about 90% of their baseline free-feeding body weight.\n3. Habituation\nTrain the mice in a 1-day session of 40 min to move inside the apparatus without the door divider, where a nose-poke in any nose-poke hole results in a pellet delivery in the food receptacle. During this phase, use only neutral stimuli (Table 1) for all different dimensions (Habituation 1).",
    "On the following day, train the animals for 40 min to move from one chamber to the other at the end of each trial (Habituation 2). Use only neutral stimuli for all different dimensions. Also in this phase, a nose-poke in any of the nose-poke holes results in a pellet delivery in the food magazine. When the mouse retrieves the reward in the food magazine, lower the dividing door to give the mouse access to the other chamber for the next trial.\nOn the third day (Habituation 3), train the animals to perform two simple discriminations (SD1 and SD2; e.g., velcro vs. film; light cue on vs. light cue off; peach vs. sage) to a criterion of 8 correct responses out of 10 consecutive trials. Do not use these exemplars again during the next phases of the test.\n\t\nTo start, place the mouse in one chamber with neutral stimuli, while in the other chamber the stimuli cues are turned on; then lower the door to give the mouse access to the chamber with the activated stimuli cues. The mouse has to learn to choose the nose-poke hole where the correct stimulus is presented. Sessions last for 40 min.\nReward a nose-poke in the correct hole with a pellet delivery and when the mouse enters the food magazine, lower the dividing door to give the mouse access to the other chamber for the next trial. Do not reward a nose-poke in the incorrect hole and turn on the house light for 5 sec. Then lower the door to give the mouse access to the other chamber for the next trial.",
    "Conduct the first ten trials of each stage as shaping trials: if the mouse selects the incorrect hole, record an error but do not terminate the trial until the mouse pokes also in the correct hole. In subsequent trials, if the mouse pokes in the incorrect hole, record an error and turn off all dimensional stimuli to terminate the trial.\nTerminate each session after 40 min or if a mouse fails to make any response for five consecutive minutes, whichever came first. If the mouse does not reach the criterion in one session, continue the test on the next day.\nIf a mouse cannot reach the criterion in the SD1 or SD2 of the Habituation 3 after 5 sessions, stop testing the mouse and eliminate it from the study, because it is not able to reliably perform basic discriminations that could thereafter affect the results of the ID/ED task.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53503/53503fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

'Stuck-in-set' ID/ED Paradigm Procedure\nNote: For this procedure, previously used in both primates and rodents7,15,16, it is necessary to manipulate three different perceptual dimensions for each single mouse tested. As for the habituation phases, all the testing daily sessions start by placing the mouse in one of the two chambers where all the stimuli are neutral. Before the beginning of a trial, the stimulus cues are switched on in the opposite chamber. Then the dividing door is lowered to give the mouse access to the other chamber where the stimulus cues are on.",
    "To train the animal to develop a set, or bias, toward a particular perceptual dimension (e.g., odor, light or floor texture), expose mice to the following discriminations presented in this order (see also an example in Figure 2):\n\t\nFor the Simple discrimination (SD), introduce mice to a dimension (odor, light or texture, see Figure 2) that is relevant in all the tasks until the EDS. That is, the relevant dimension is the one indicating where the correct response is. Following the example of Figure 2, present two odors, such as vanilla (O1) and lavender (O2), and select O1 as the correct response.\nFor the Compound discrimination (CD), introduce a second dimension, for example the light, which is irrelevant (i.e., not indicating were the correct response is). Present two lights (L1 and L2) together with the odors (O1 and O2) in order to have two possible discriminations (see example in Figure 2). The correct and incorrect exemplars are the same as in SD.\nFor the reversal of the Compound discrimination (CDRe), leave the exemplars and the relevant dimension unchanged, but have the animals learn that the previously correct stimulus is now incorrect. For example, select lavender as the correct response, with vanilla being now the incorrect choice. These same conditions will be found for the other reversal phases (i.e., IDSRe, IDS2Re and EDSRe).",
    "After that, select an Intra-dimensional shift (IDS) in which new exemplars are used for both the relevant and irrelevant dimensions (a total change design). For example, use strawberry and cinnamon (O3 and O4) as the odors and blue and yellow lights (L3 and L4) as the lights. However, ensure that the testing subjects keep following the same relevant dimension in order to find the correct response. These same conditions will be found for the other intradimensional shift (i.e., IDS2).\nAs for the previous discrimination, have the mice perform the reversal of the Intra-dimensional shift (IDSRe). Use the same conditions as in CDRe.\nFor Intra-dimensional shift 2 (IDS2), use the same conditions as in IDS.\nSimilarly, use the same conditions as in CDRe for the Intra-dimensional shift reversal 2 (IDSRe2).\nIn the Extra-dimensional shift (EDS), have the mice choose the correct hole after a newly presented stimulus dimension. Present a pair of stimuli from a new dimension, which is the texture. For example use coarse sandpaper (T1) as the correct response and fine sandpaper (T2) as incorrect, and present them with two new odors, for example lemon and apricot (O7 and O8). The previously relevant dimension has now become irrelevant. Do not present the previously irrelevant dimension anymore.\nFor the Extra-dimensional reversal (EDSRe), use the same conditions as in CDRe.",
    "Measure the performance of the mice until they reach a criterion of 8 correct choices out of 10 consecutive trials to complete each stage. Set the program (see Table of Materials) to automatically move on to the next stage after the criterion is reached. Stop a daily session after 40 min, or if a mouse fails to make any response for 5 consecutive minutes, terminate the session and continue the next day with the mouse on the same stage where it left off.\n\t\nFor each stage, measure the time to reach the criterion. If a mouse does not reach the criterion in one session, sum up the total time taken in consecutive sessions. For each trial, measure the time from presentation of the stimuli (odors, lights, textures) to a nose-poke response (latency to respond).\nAt the end of each session, wipe down the apparatus with 70% alcohol.\nUse always the same order of the discriminations. However, randomly change the stimulus dimensions and the pairs of exemplars used and equally represent them within experimental groups and counterbalance them between groups.\nMake sure to equally counterbalance the perceptual dimensions used within and between each experimental group so that each possible ED shift is represented (i.e., light to odor, light to texture, odor to light, odor to texture, texture to light, texture to odor). The combinations of exemplars are too numerous to permit full counterbalancing; therefore, to reduce the degrees of freedom, always use exemplars in pairs; for example, vanilla stimulus with lavender etc. (see Table 1).\n5. 'Two-dimension' ID/ED Paradigm Procedure\nNote: Another condition to measure attentional set-shifting ability, used both in primates12,17 and rodents13, is the 'two-dimension' paradigm. In this case, only two perceptual dimensions are used throughout the test.",
    "For this protocol, use the order of the discriminations and the procedure to follow as described for the 'stuck-in-set' protocol up to the EDS stage (see an example in Figure 2):\n\t\nFor the SD and the following stages, use the same pairs of the 'stuck-in-set', until the IDS2Re. As shown in the example of Figure 2, use two odors (O1 and O2, use O1 as correct stimulus).\nFor the CD, as in the 'stuck-in-set' protocol, introduce a new dimension (for example light, L1 and L2), that is irrelevant and would serve as a confounder.\nThe CDRe is similar as in the 'stuck-in-set' protocol, thus leave the exemplars and the relevant dimension unchanged, but have the animals learn that the previously correct stimulus is now incorrect (e.g., O1).\nIn the IDS, use always new pairs of stimuli for both dimensions (O3 and O4, L3 and L4, where O3 is the correct stimulus).\nFor the IDSRe, have the mice perform the reversal of the IDS. Select the correct exemplar that is the one that was incorrect during the IDS (e.g., O4).\nFor the IDS2, introduce new pairs of stimuli for both dimensions (O5 and O6, L5 and L6).\nAs in the previous reversal stages, in the IDS2Re, have the animals learn that the previously correct stimulus is now incorrect (e.g., O5).\nFor the 'two-dimension' protocol, the EDS, the mice have to choose the correct response after the previously irrelevant dimension now becomes the relevant dimension. Thus, light is the new relevant dimension, which indicates the correct response. In particular, red light (L7) is the correct response. Conversely, the previously relevant dimension (in the example, odor) is now the irrelevant one.",
    "After the EDS, for the reversal (EDSRe), use same conditions as in CDRe. The relevant dimension is the same as in the EDS but the correct and incorrect exemplars are inverted. Thus, for example, green light (L8) is now the correct response.\n6. Data Analysis\nMeasure the performance by: number of trials to reach the criterion; time to reach the criterion (in minutes); time from presentation of the stimuli to a nose-poke response (latency to respond).\nFor statistical analysis, use ANOVAs with the different stages (SD, CD, CDRe, IDS, IDSRe, IDS2, IDSRe2, EDS, and EDSRe) as a within-subject factor to examine the number of trials required to reach the criteria, timing needed to complete each stage and the latency to respond. Conduct post-hoc analyses using Newman-Keuls test. Note: The accepted value for significance is p<0.05."
