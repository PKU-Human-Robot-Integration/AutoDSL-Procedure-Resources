  "title": "Using Enclosed Y-Mazes to Assess Chemosensory Behavior in Reptiles",
  "procedures": [
    "All procedures involving the use of live vertebrates were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Geological Survey.\nNOTE: Because these studies focus on invasive vertebrates, compliance with containment standards must also be met, which impose specific constraints on the design and execution of experiments. Although many of the methods are similar between the two study locations and diurnal vs. nocturnal study timing, distinct methods have been described in each of the following two sections.\n1. Y-maze setup and diurnal protocol for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Wildlife Services National Wildlife Research Center Florida Field Station: on-site testing of wild-caught, captive tegus\nNOTE: Plans for all components of the Y-maze and containment structure are provided in Supplemental File 1.\nY-maze dimensions and design\n\t\nUse a bottom piece (1.22 m x 2.44 m fiber cement siding panels) to anchor the Y-maze. Drill holes in the top layer to allow carriage bolts to pass upward for the attachment of the maze pieces. For specific directions, see Supplemental File 1.\nConstruct the walls of the maze out of white PVC trim board; internal dimensions of the base are 120 cm L (side walls) x 42 cm W x 14 cm H.\n\t\tNOTE: Passageway width was designed to accommodate 2x focal animal width. Extra width allows flexibility for two, animal-deposited scent trails to be created.\nMake sure that the internal dimensions of the arms are 120 cm L (side walls) x 40 cm W x 14 cm H.\nAssemble the maze using separate bottom, side, and top components secured together prior to running a trial. Make the top out of clear acrylic to enable visualization of animals within maze. For specific directions, see Supplemental File 1.",
    "When a single scent trail is created, use an internal partition in the base to restrict space access for the scent-laying tegu. For specific directions, see Supplemental File 1.\nWhen two scent trails are deposited by different animals in sequence, use a system of partitions to block alternating arms of the maze and exclude each animal from alternating halves of the base. For specific directions, see Supplemental File 1.\nUse boxes to allow transport and collection of animals used in Y-maze trials. Make sure that all boxes are opaque and fitted with removable lids and acrylic doors that are easily secured.\n\t\t\nEnsure that the base box (109 cm L x 56 cm W x 46 cm H) is at the opening of the base of the Y-maze. Use it to transfer scenting or focal animals to the maze and for acclimation prior to opening the door and permitting voluntary access of the animals into the maze.\nMake sure that the arm boxes (83 cm L x 50 cm W x 44 cm H) are at the terminal ends of the arms of the Y-maze to facilitate the capture of either scenting or focal animals.\nFor specific directions on construction and assembly, see Supplemental File 1.\nCamera setup for diurnal video acquisition\n\t\nCamera specifications: Ensure that project cameras can record continuous video under variable light conditions and are suitable for outdoor use under prevailing temperature and humidity conditions.\n\t\t\nWith the camera mounted to the underside of the study enclosure, ensure that the entire Y-maze can be captured in the camera's field of view. Adjust the lens or height of the camera to increase or decrease the field of view. When the field of view is set, ensure that sufficient behavioral detail, such as tongue-flicks, can be captured.",
    "​NOTE: If the height of study enclosure is fixed (e.g., 180 cm H) thereby limiting adjustments to the field of view, multiple cameras can be used to obtain complete coverage of the Y-maze interior. Ensure that cameras are set to enable \"wide dynamic range\" when used in outdoor applications.\nPower specifications: Ensure that each camera has an adequate power supply to record continuous video for the duration of the planned trial (e.g., use an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) with a built-in backup battery to ensure continuous power).\n\t\t​NOTE: If there is no AC power supply available, POE (power over ethernet) cameras can be powered via network cables connected to a digital video recorder (DVR) or POE switch where a network video recorder (NVR) is used.\nRecording specifications: When choosing a DVR or NVR, make sure that it meets project requirements including sufficient storage capacity and enough POE connectors (DVR) or camera channels (NVR) to accommodate the number of cameras used. Select recording parameters to suit the video quality desired, keeping the size of the data files in mind (e.g., H264 compression rate and an image rate of 10 frames per second [FPS]).\nProtocol for obtaining and processing video:\n\t\t\nBegin recording the video from the moment the animal begins to enter maze to the moment of capture or preset timeframe (1.3.3.4).\nUsing software that can be installed on one or more computers and allows viewing of live or recorded video, export files using the video format of choice.\nBe sure to export the same time window and duration of video for each camera used to allow simultaneous review of multiple feeds.\nBe sure to export the data regularly because many systems will overwrite older data with new data if DVR/NVR file storage capacity is limited.\nProtocol for running scent-laying animals",
    "Assessment of bias\n\t\t\nPrior to running experimental trials, assess a Y-maze for bias by assembling the maze, as described below, but without presenting the scent on the paper. Acclimate the focal animal, and start the trial.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Depending on the design of the study (e.g., repeated measures using the same focal animals vs. testing of novel focal animals each time), bias trials will establish that the maze itself, by design, does not bias a focal animal's choice. Many factors contribute to bias such as elevation, sunlight, and visual markers.\nIf reorienting or adjusting other physical aspects of the maze do not remove side bias, randomize the arm designated to receive an experimental scent in a given trial.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Over a set number of trials, an unbiased maze results in a choice probability of 0.5 for either arm, and a binomial test is performed (Figure 2).\nTrial preparation and Y-maze assembly\n\t\t\nWear nitrile gloves throughout when handling any surfaces that the animal can explore to avoid scent contamination. Change the gloves between trials and within the setup of a trial if multiple scent trails are being created.\nPrepare new, clean scenting paper (white butcher paper, minimum 61 cm wide) on a clean surface. Cut to appropriate length such that the paper for each section can overlap at the junction of the Y and extend past the ends of the base and the arms to fit under the boxes.\nSweep the bottom of the maze and then cover either with paper directly or with a boundary layer between the paper and bottom (e.g., plastic sheeting) to facilitate clean-up if the animal defecates or musks in the maze.",
    "Secure the paper in place by piercing it with carriage bolts in the bottom, working from one end to another to keep the surface smooth. Overlap the papers at the junction such that the base paper is on top.\nPlace the sides of the maze into position over the carriage bolts, but do not secure them to the bottom.\nInsert and secure the partition(s) needed for the trial type to be tested (see single-scent 1.3.3 vs. double-scent trials 1.3.4).\nSlide the acrylic top pieces into slots, and secure with flat head nails.\nSecure the sides to the bottom by tightening the wing nuts to the carriage bolts.\nPut the clean arm boxes into place, and secure with thumb screws. Secure the box lid using cable ties. Ensure that the doors have been removed.\nSingle-scent trials\n\t\t​NOTE: The purpose of these trials is to present a single scent trail in the Y-maze that runs from the base through one arm.\n\t\t\nBefore fitting the acrylic top, secure the partition to block the untreated arm. Select the scented arm randomly (e.g., coin toss, random number generator).\nPlace the scent-laying animal into the clean, dry base box. Secure the lid of the base box (e.g., cable ties, bolts) and the door (e.g., thumb screw). Transport the holding box to the study enclosure, and secure it to the end of the base of the Y-maze with thumb screws.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the door to the base box is in place prior to loading the animal.\nAcclimate the animal in the box for a set, consistent period (e.g., 60 min). Remove the base box door, and allow the animal to enter the maze freely.",
    "Monitor animal activity remotely using video feed (see below). After the animal has traveled from the base box to the arm box, remove the animal from the maze as scenting is complete.\n\t\t\t\nIf the animal is inside any box, insert and secure the removable door, remove the box, and return the animal to its enclosure.\nIf the animal is back in the maze, wait near the maze until the animal is seen returning to the box, and then remove the box.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Squamates defecate defensively and create alarm cues that contaminate the scent being tested, so avoid startling the animal.\nIf the animal does not return to a box, slowly approach the maze and use visual cues (e.g., slow hand waving) to encourage the animal into the box, and then remove the box.\nClean and dry the base box (1.5.5).\nIf defecation occurred, collect and absorb as much as possible with a paper towel, but do not wipe to prevent spreading.\nPartially disassemble the maze to allow removal of the interior partition, and then reassemble. Clean the partition (1.5.5).\nProceed to section 1.4 for protocol for running focal animals.\nDouble-scent trials\n\t\t​NOTE: The purpose of these trials is to present two different scent trails simultaneously in the Y-maze, with both running from the base through their respective, randomly chosen arm.\n\t\t\nBefore fitting the acrylic top, secure the partitions to block the arm not chosen for the first scent and half of the base opposite to the blocked arm.",
    "Follow the procedures outlined above for a single scent trial (1.3.3 to 1.3.3.8) with one exception. When the acrylic door is removed (1.3.3.3), insert a half-size door into the opening on the side that is to remain blocked to ensure that the scenting animal can only move in the open section of maze.\nPartially disassemble the maze, remove the partitions, and clean (1.5.5). Dry with clean towels.\nReinstall the partitions, but flip them to block the now-scented area of the maze. Reinstall the acrylic top.\nRepeat step 1.3.4.2 for the second scent-laying animal.\nPartially disassemble the maze and remove the partitions. Reassemble the maze.\nProceed to section 1.4 for protocol for running focal animals.\nProtocol for running focal animals during diurnal hours\n\t\nFollow steps 1.3.3.2 to 1.3.3.3 with the focal animal planned for that trial.\nMonitor animal activity remotely using video. If observing over a set window of exploration time, start the timer when the animal has completely emerged from the base box.\nAt the completion of the trial, remove the animal (1.3.3.4).\nBreakdown and clean-up\n\t\nDetach the remaining boxes from the maze and disassemble all the boxes. Wear fresh nitrile gloves throughout the disassembly and cleaning.\nRemove the acrylic top pieces and set them aside in a safe location for cleaning to avoid scratching or cracking. Be sure to avoid scratching pieces when removed (clear field of view for video-monitoring behavior must be maintained). Disassemble the sides of the maze and set them aside for cleaning.\n\t\tNOTE: Minimize scratches and UV degradation to Y-maze materials by keeping them always shaded.\nRemove the paper (and plastic) in a consistent motion by rolling it up to avoid contamination of the bottom and discard it.",
    "Use an odorless, laboratory-grade soap and soft scrub brush or microfiber cloths to clean all the surfaces of the Y-maze pieces and all the boxes. Clean the acrylic top pieces and removable doors with the same soap, but with soft sponge or microfiber cloths to prevent scratching.\n\t\tNOTE: The known chemical signals in squamate reptiles are lipid-soluble compounds, and washing with a detergent is the standard protocol for cleaning lipid cues and other scents from polymer-based apparatuses in terrestrial vertebrate studies11,12,21.\n\t\tNOTE: In field applications, sanitation protocols may be required. If so, spray all the inner surfaces of the maze (floor, walls, partitions, acrylic pieces, boxes) with an appropriate sanitation solution, let it sit for 10 min, and then wipe with a microfiber cloth.\nRinse the cleaned components with water by wiping the surfaces with clean, wet microfiber towels, and avoid allowing soap residue to dry prior to rinsing; do not pour water into the maze.\nAllow the pieces to air dry or pat them dry with fresh microfiber cloths.\nOnce dry, reassemble the maze pieces if running another trial immediately.\n2. Y-maze setup and crepuscular timing protocol for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) trials in collaboration with National Park Service: relatively remote testing of wild-caught Burmese pythons\nNOTE:Plans for all components of the Y-maze and containment structure are provided in Supplemental File 2.\nY-maze components and rationale for changes to USDA design\n\tNOTE: The Y-maze described was significantly altered to expand potential research species and in isolated conditions. The vertical depth was increased to accommodate a variety of species, and different materials and construction methods were used to improve outdoor durability and cleaning. See Figure 1 for a visualization of the completed maze. For specific directions on construction and assembly, see Supplemental File 2.",
    "Cut Y-maze components from white polypropylene, and heat-weld all cut pieces that are to be permanently fixed (e.g., maze bottom and side walls).\n\t\t\nAnchor the bottom of the Y-maze (244 cm L x 122 cm W) made of plywood sheets fastened together with deck screws, attaching it via an aluminum angle bracket riveted along the bottom of the outer side walls of the maze.\nEnsure that the base of the Y-maze is 120 cm L x 42 cm W x 23 cm H, and that each outer arm side wall is 120 cm L, inner arm side wall is 108 cm L (for specific directions, see Supplemental File 2).\nSlot the acrylic top into place using an aluminum angle fixed to the side walls with screws every 30 cm (for specific directions, see Supplemental File 2).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Screws placed at regular intervals at the top edge of the Y-maze side walls also serve as static visual markers when analyzing the video from the trials and provide scale.\nEnsure that each opening of the Y-maze (base, arms) has an additional baseplate (42 cm W x 30 cm H) on the end of the side wall that attaches to a box so that the baseplate frames a central opening (34 cm W x 16 cm H; for specific directions, see Supplemental File 2).\nUse a partition piece to restrict access of the scenting animal (for specific directions, see Supplemental File 2). Secure a blocking plate (46 cm W x 22 cm H) in place using fastener tape. Anchor the partition and the plate using improvised, easily cleaned weights (e.g., plastic jug filled with water; 2.3.6; Figure 1).\nEnsure that the acrylic pieces make up the top of the maze (0.6 cm thick, clear). For specific directions, see Supplemental File 2.",
    "Use opaque boxes fitted with a sliding door and lids that are easily secured to allow for transport and collection of animals in Y-maze trials (Figure 1).\n​Modify the boxes (21.6 cm L x 27.9 cm W) with drain holes in the bottom, fit the lids with small screws and nuts, and provide a single opening for ingress/egress (the door). For specific directions, see Supplemental File 2.\nFasten the box to the end of the Y-maze by attaching the box faceplate to the Y-maze faceplate using bolts and wingnuts or locks.\n\t\t\tNOTE: When in place, boxes also anchor the acrylic top pieces in place.\nCamera setup for crepuscular video acquisition: See Figure 1 for a snapshot of the camera field of view.\n\t\nCamera specifications: Ensure that the project camera can record continuous video under variable light and temperature conditions to accommodate crepuscular and nocturnal study species.\n\t\t\nWith the project camera mounted on the ceiling crossbeams of the enclosure, ensure that the entire Y-maze can be captured within the camera's field of view. Raise or lower the height of the tent to increase or decrease the field of view (project camera mounted at a height of ~3 m). Ensure that the reflection of the infrared light emitted from the camera on the acrylic top does not obscure critical portions of the frames in the overnight footage.\nPower specifications: Ensure that each project camera has an adequate power supply to record continuous video for overnight filming (approximately 20 h).\n\t\tNOTE: If there is no AC power supply available, power can be supplied using deep cycle sealed lead acid 12-volt batteries (e.g., two 12-V 20-Ah gel batteries wired in parallel).",
    "Recording specifications: To minimize the file storage volume, record the lowest quality video that is still adequate to enable counting of tongue-flicks in the Y-maze.\n\t\t​NOTE: High-resolution footage requires large storage volume, and lowering the resolution is a very effective way of ensuring that file sizes are manageable.\n\t\t\nLimit the framerate (frames per second, FPS) of footage to the minimum needed to detect tongue-flicks (e.g., recording resolution of 800 x 450 with a maximum framerate of 25 FPS results in approx.120 GB of footage per trial).\nProtocol for obtaining and processing video\n\t\t\nArm the camera at the beginning of each scenting event (2.3.10), and let it record continuously through to the end of the focal event (approximately 20 h).\nAfter each trial is complete, power off the camera and retrieve the SD card (2.4.4). Transfer the footage to the desired storage location.\nAs SD cards frequently force recording devices to record footage in 5-min clips, combine these clips using movie processing software for ease of processing.\nReview the footage using a media file reviewing program that allows variable playback speed and customizable forward-jump intervals.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This reduces review time from about 20 h down to a maximum of 1 h if fine-scale resolution is not required during video processing.\nProtocol for running scent-laying animals\n\tNOTE: Steps in this section will take approximately 1.5 days to complete due to longer acclimation times for wild reptiles.\n\t\nSee bias preface in section 1.3.1 to ensure that no bias can be found in the maze.\nWear nitrile gloves throughout when handling any surfaces or study animals to avoid scent contamination.\nPlace the scenting or focal animal into its box at least 24 h prior to the trial for acclimation.",
    "NOTE: To minimize stress effects, the box is left in a shaded area as close to the maze as possible without being disturbed by cleaning or other activities. Ensure that all animals tested (scenting, focal) are acclimated this way.\nPrepare new, clean scenting paper on a clean surface and of sufficient length to overlap at the junction of the Y, and cover the entire bottom surface (2 arm papers = 121.9 cm; 1 base paper = 152.4 cm).\nSecure the ends of the papers near the boxes and the Y-junction with masking tape.\nInstall the partitions to block half of the base arm (left or right side) with a long partition, and block the entrance to the opposite arm with a short partition. When installing the barriers, do not rip the scenting paper. For large scenting animals, affix a heavy object that can easily be removed and cleaned behind the barrier as a brace to prevent barrier failure (2.1.1.5).\n\t\tNOTE: The scent trail must always start on one side of the base, then cross to the opposite arm so that focal animal's choice is clear.\nSlide the acrylic top into place, one section at a time, and ensure that the angles meet completely. Use clear plastic tape to cover any gaps.\nAttach both the arm boxes to the maze by connecting the faceplates using wingnuts and/or padlocks, and ensure that the doors are locked open.\nTwo hours before sunset, attach the base box (containing the scenting animal), and ensure all movements are slow and steady to minimize stress to the animal.\nArm the camera, and open the door to the base box, being sure to latch the door in place using both barrel bolt locks. Remain out of the animal's view, and exit the area.",
    "After 3 h (1 h after sunset), note the location of the animal within the maze as well as the ambient conditions. If the animal is in transit, wait until it enters the box.\n\t\t\nIf the animal is in any box, close and secure the box door, remove the box, and then remove the animal, taking care to prevent defensive scent deposition in the box.\nIf the animal is motionless inside the body of the maze, use visual cues (e.g., long rod or hand waving) to stimulate its movement into a box. If the animal remains, remove the arm box(es) so that the acrylic top can be removed, and the animal can be collected manually and transferred to a bag.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Proper personal protective equipment (PPE) is always to be worn when handling large animals (e.g., puncture-resistant gloves, eye protection).\nPartially disassemble the maze to allow removal of the interior partitions (avoid disturbing the scent paper) and then reassemble. If defecation occurred, collect and absorb as much as possible with clean microfiber cloths, but do not wash the area.\nProceed to section 2.4 for protocol for running focal animals.\nProtocol for running crepuscular focal animals\n\tNOTE: Steps in this section will take approximately 2 days to complete and must begin around the same time as the start of section 2.3.\n\t\nAcclimate the scheduled focal animal in the box for at least 24 h prior to being run in maze.\n\t\t\nDuring the final hours of focal animal acclimation, run the scent-laying animal prior to moving to the next step (2.3.9).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Time the scent-laying step as close as possible to the time of introduction of the focal animal to the maze to reduce scent degradation.",
    "Attach the base box (containing the focal animal) using wing nuts and/or padlocks to the base of the Y-maze. Use slow, steady movements when holding/transporting the box to minimize stress to the focal animal.\n\t\t\nEnsure that both the arm box doors are latched opened. Begin the focal trial by opening and latching the base box door using barrel bolts. Remain out of the animal's view and exit the area.\n\t\t\tNOTE: With wild nocturnal reptile trials, focal animals are given overnight to explore the maze.\nFour hours after sunrise, return to the maze and follow section 2.3.11.1 to remove the focal animal.\nCollect the camera SD card and recharge the batteries if needed. Discard the used paper from the maze and proceed to cleaning (section 1.5).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61858/61858fig01.jpg\nFigure 1. Layout of the USGS Y-maze.
