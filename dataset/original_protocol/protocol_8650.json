    "All procedures for the isolation of the cells were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Michigan State University.\n1. Preparation of Pre-stretched Anisotropic Surface \nMix a 10:1 solution of base and curing agent and pour the mixture into a tissue culture dish (12 cm diameter). Use 4,900 mg base and 490 mg curing agent for the total crosslinking mixture.\nKeep the gel mixture under vacuum for 20 min to remove air bubbles.\nPlace the gel mixture in the oven for overnight curing at 60 °C.\nAfter the PDMS membrane cures, treat the surface with oxygen plasma using a plasma cleaning/etching system for 3 min at 165 mTorr and 65 sccm flow of O2.\nCut a piece of rectangular membrane (5 × 3.5 cm) from the dish, while being cognizant which side is oxygen-treated, make sure the oxygen-treated side is facing up and fix onto a stretching frame. Place the frame on a stretching stage and evenly stretch by turning the knob on the stage until it reaches 10% elongation (or some other pre-determined stretch; the elongation can be directly read from the stretching stage) in the longer axis 9. Fix the stretch by tightening the screws on the frame.\nRemove the frame from the stage. Ensure the membrane surface is dry and free of dust, then place a silicone chamber onto the membrane allowing the sticky side of the chamber to attach tightly to the membrane.\n\tNote: The silicone chamber provides a well for retaining the cell medium on the PDMS membrane. The device design is shown in Figure 1.\nSterilize the surface with UV for 10 min.",
    "Add 1 ml Poly-L-Lysine (PLL) (0.01% in Phosphate Buffered Saline) to the PDMS surface within the chamber, within 6 hr of plasma treatment and incubate for 2 hr at 37 °C prior to seeding the DRG neurons. This enhances cell attachment.\n2. Isolation of DRG\nPrepare standard growth medium for the DRG neurons.\nPrior to the isolation, autoclave the isolation equipment and filter reagents. Add 5 ml of isolation buffer into one well of a 6-well plate, and place the plate on ice. Prepare 10 ml of dissociation medium by adding 1 ml of collagenase A (500 U/ml) to 9 ml of 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA (1 mg/ml), filter the solutions with a 0.22 µm filter and place on ice.\nUse ten to twelve 5 - 7 days' old Sprague-Dawley rats for the isolation. Spray the pups with 75% isopropanol, and sacrifice by decapitation.\nCut away the skin overlying the spinal cord from the back and remove any excess tissue around the spine. Under a surgical magnifier with the surgical spot lights on, make the first incision from the neck and then one cut along the spine on both sides with scissors. Detach the spine from the body of the pups and remove the excess muscles. Then, use scissors to cut along the long axis of the spine and use tweezers to open the spine completely and extract the spinal cord.Remove the tip from a pipette to create a larger opening for transferring the DRGs with isolation buffer into a sterile 15 ml tube.\nUsing a fine pair of tweezers, remove the ganglion from the bone pocket and collect approximately 10 – 16 DRG from both sides. Trim the nerve roots and transfer the ganglia to the ice-cold isolation buffer.",
    "Remove the tip from a pipette to create a larger opening for transferring the DRGs with isolation buffer into a sterile 15 ml tube. After the chemical dissociation, centrifuge the ganglia at 900 x g and 4 °C for 5 min.\nLet the tissues settle to the bottom of the tube and gently remove the isolation buffer on top and add 10 ml of dissociation medium into the tube.\nIncubate the dissected tissues in the dissociation medium in a 37 °C water bath for 1 hr while shaking the tube every 5 - 10 min.\nAfter the chemical dissociation, centrifuge the ganglia at 900 x g and 4 °C for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in 10 ml standard growth media and vortex.\nCentrifuge the dissociated cells as indicated in section 2.9 once again.\nRemove the supernatant, re-suspend the pellet in 12 ml of standard growth media and vortex.\n3. Culture of DRG on Pre-stretched Surface\nPrior to seeding the cells, remove the PLL solutions from the chamber and rinse the PDMS surface with sterile water and air dry.\nAfter re-suspending the cells, let the suspension set for 1 - 2 min to allow the debris to settle to the bottom of the tube. Add 1.5 ml of cell suspension into each stretch chamber and incubate at 37 °C at 5% CO2.\nTo eliminate glial cells, at 1 day in vitro (DIV), add 10 µl (or 15 µl) mixture of fluoro-2 deoxy-uridine and uridine (FDU-U) stock solution (See Table of Materials) to each well. After 7 hr, replace this medium with fresh standard growth medium and place the pre-stretched culture device in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2.",
    "During the cell culture period (2 - 3 weeks), change the media every two days by replacing half the spent medium with fresh medium. Note: After culturing on the stretched and unstretched surfaces for 2 weeks, purified SCs are added to the chamber and cultured for another week (step 4.7).\n4. Co-culture of Schwann Cells (SCs) with DRG Neurons on Pre-stretched Surface\nIsolate SCs as described by Dr. Campana's group previously 15.\n\t\nBriefly, isolate the SCs from a 1 day old pup. Collect and dissociate the sciatic nerves both chemically (Trypsin-EDTA and Collagenase A) and mechanically (18 gauge needle/10 ml syringe) 15.\nSeed the dissociated cells into poly-D-lysine (PDL) coated T25 flask and culture at 37 °C at 5% CO2. On day 5, purify the cells through antibody selection using Anti-thy 1.1 antibody and Rabbit Complement and subculture the purified cells to passage 2 - 4. Use culture medium containing Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Penn/Strep), 21 µg/ml Bovine Pituitary Extract (BPE), and 4 µM Forskolin.\nRemove the culture medium from the SCs, and add 5 ml 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA into the flask. Incubate the cells at 37 °C at 5% CO2 for 2 - 3 min.\nCheck cells under the optical microscope using a 10X objective to see if they lift up from the flask, then add 5 ml of culture medium and mix with the cells in the flask.\nAdd the cell suspension to a 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 200 x g and 20 °C for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 7 ml standard DRG growth media.",
    "Take 10 µl of cell suspension into a 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, mix with 10 µl of trypan blue, and then count the cell number using a hemocytometer under optical microscopy using a 10X objective. Dilute the cell suspension to 5,000 cells per ml by adding DRG growth media.\nRemove 0.5 ml of medium from the DRG culture in the stretched chamber and add 0.5 ml of SC suspension to the DRG culture.\nCulture the cells for 1 week at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Change the media every two days by replacing half the spent medium with fresh standard growth medium for DRG. After 1 week co-culture, process the cells by immunohistochemistry 10.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
