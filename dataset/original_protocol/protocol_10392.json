    "Note: The training protocol described within this manuscript was developed during a pilot project entitled: \"The ReWalk Exoskeletal Walking System for Persons with Paraplegia\" registered with ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01454570. Developing a training program was not the objective of this pilot project however; the training program evolved during the course of conducting this study. The study protocol and informed consent form were reviewed and approved by the JJPVAMC's Institutional Review Board (IRB). The entire study and the procedures were explained to each study participant. The potential participant was given the opportunity to ask questions and was encouraged to take as much time as needed prior to consenting.\n1. Participant Recruitment\nPerform a pre-screening evaluation with the potential participants.\n\t\nBriefly explain the details of the training process (length of study, times per week, hours per day). Explain the known risks of participation (skin abrasions, potential injury if one were to fall and the potential for unforeseeable events).\n\t\tNote: Within this protocol the training sessions occurred 3 times per week and lasted between 60 to 90 min. A specific frequency and/or duration of the training sessions are not required in order for the participants to learn to use the powered exoskeleton.\n\t\t\nDescribe the medical restrictions to the potential participant such as: low bone mineral density at the hip or knee, recent history of fractures, unable to tolerate standing, weak upper extremity strength and, weak trunk control. Review the inclusion and exclusion criteria in order to continue to the screening process. Encourage the potential participant to ask questions. Provide ample time to address any concerns and answer questions.\n\t\t\tNote: The anthropometric restrictions for the specific powered exoskeleton used herein were applied to the inclusion criteria for: height <160 or >190 cm and weight <100 kg.",
    "If the prescreening evaluation is successful, then provide a detailed explanation of the study and initiate the screening process.\n\t\nPerform a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan to evaluate bone mineral density bilaterally at the hip and knee.\n\t\tNote: The facility has limited the use of the exoskeletons to persons who have a T-Score at the total hip and femoral neck to be greater than -3.5 and a BMD at the proximal tibia and distal femur to be greater than 0.60 g/cm2. These values do not eliminate the risk of fracture but were chosen in an effort to reduce the risk. Clinicians are encouraged to review the relevant literature and adjust the values according to their interpretation of the information31-33.\nPerform the International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI (ISNSCI)37 examination to evaluate injury level, motor function and sensation.\n\t\tNote: In this pilot research study participants with varying levels of injury were included and are presented in Table 1. Persons with paraplegia are the predominant users; however persons with cervical injuries who have upper extremity motor scores of 4 or better for the individual muscle groups and are able to maintain balance with the crutches may be a candidate for using this exoskeleton, as well as other powered exoskeletons.\nObtain a general medical history and physical evaluation which also includes range of motion of the shoulders, hips and knees, and skin check of areas on the lower extremity and lower back that contacts the powered exoskeleton.",
    "Note: Persons with limited hip and knee range of motion of 20Â° of flexion or greater at either joints were excluded. Additionally, the shoulders must have had enough range of motion to achieve proper crutch placement to perform the sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit maneuvers. Participants must also be free of any pressure ulcers in the lower extremities, particularly any area with direct contact with the exoskeleton. These criteria may vary for each device and the clinicians should refer to the manufacturer for the requirements specific to that powered exoskeleton.\n2. Fitting\nNote: The fitting procedures were developed by the manufacture of the device. The methodology of fitting a person to the device will also vary among the different exoskeletons. Clinicians should refer to each of the specific manufacture's procedures.\nPlace the participant in a supine position. Using a flexible tape measure, determine the pelvic width, upper leg length and lower leg length and record in centimeters.\n\t\nMeasure the upper leg length from the most prominent point of the greater trochanter of the hip to the knee joint line. Measure the other limb in the same manner. Record any limb length discrepancies. Adjust the powered exoskeleton from the center of the hip axis to the center of the knee axis according to the distance measured on each of the participant's upper leg lengths.\nMeasure the lower leg length from the knee joint line to the bottom of the foot. Repeat the measurement for the other lower leg length. Adjust the length from the bottom of the footplate to the center of the knee axis on the powered exoskeleton for each lower limb according to the distances measured from the participant.",
    "Adjust the width of the powered-exoskeleton using different size pelvic bands. Select the pelvic band by placing the participant in a seated position on a chair or bench with an open back. Place the pelvic band closest in size to the participant's pelvic width behind the person and slowly move it forward to test it for a fit. Allow up to 1 cm clearance on either side of the pelvic girdle.\n\t\tNote: Other powered exoskeletons are adjusted in a different manner and appropriate adjustment should be obtained according to the manufacture's specifications.\nAfter choosing the appropriate pelvic band size, affix the pelvic band to the thoracic uprights in the neutral or centered position. After the participate is in standing position, adjust the fore/aft position appropriately, if needed, so that the trochanter is in line with the rotation of the hip joint.\n\t\tNote: The pelvic band can be set so that it can to push the hips anteriorly or posteriorly. The neutral or centered position is the setting of the pelvic band to that it allow for adjustments of equal amounts anteriorly or posteriorly.\nFit and adjust the foot plate by removing the participant's shoe, removing the insole from the shoe, then place the largest footplate possible into the shoe. Place the insole on top of the footplate. Adjust the dorsiflexion assistance of the footplate by fine-tuning the tension on the spring mechanism at the ankle.\nAfter completing all measurements, the system is now ready for donning by the participant.\n3. Donning\nNote: The donning procedures were developed by the manufacture of the device. The methodology of donning a person to the powered exoskeleton may vary among the different devices and clinicians should refer to the manufacture's procedures.",
    "Place the exoskeleton in a seated position on a chair with the strapping open.\n\tNote: The ideal chair has a wide padded seat and must not have arm rests or wheels.\n\t\nInstruct the participant to place their wheelchair next to the seated exoskeleton at a slight angle.\nAsk the participant to transfer into the device by placing one hand on the device, the other on their wheelchair. Ensure that the participant performs the transfer into the device in one continuous motion. If the participant is unable to complete the transfer in one movement, encourage them to rest momentarily on the upper \"thigh\" portion of the exoskeleton, and to resume the transfer with a second motion.\n\t\tNote: Assistance with the transfer may be provided if needed.\nAfter the participant is seated properly in the device, instruct the participant to first place their feet in the shoes, then continue securing the straps starting at the most distal point and moving proximally up the body, finishing with the chest straps.\n\t\nIf needed, use the manual control feature to flex the hip slightly and extend the knee to permit easier placement of the feet into the shoes.\nCarefully guide the foot into the shoe, taking special care to ensure the toes are not curled. Once the foot is properly in the shoe, the use the manual controls to move the leg and foot back on the floor, then fasten the shoe. Follow the same steps to ensure proper placement of the second foot into the shoe.",
    "After securing the feet in the shoes, secure the straps directly below the knees, followed by securing the straps above the knees and those for the upper thighs. Take care to avoid crumpling of clothing beneath the straps to avoid unwanted friction and/or pressure points of contact. Secure the lower and upper chest straps last.\nOnce the participant is strapped into the device, examine them for any inappropriate contact, crumpled clothing or pressure points.\n\t\nFollowing identification of a pressure point, release the pressure by adjusting the fit and adding or removing padding as appropriate.\n\t\tNote: Examine the fit while seated, standing and after walking a few steps. The participant may shift slightly when standing and after walking which may lead to additional points of contact that may be identified by re-examination.\n4. Standing\nNote: The procedure to stand-up was developed by the manufacture of the device and may vary among the different exoskeletons. Clinicians should refer to the manufacture's procedures.\nAfter fitting, introduce the participant to the overall functions of the exoskeleton. Explain the controller specific to the device. Inform the participant that s/he will be expected to become as independent as possible with the exoskeleton. Explain that independence will be accomplished by learning to control the functions of device and that there are short term and long term goals to become independent.\n\tNote: Initially the trainer operates the controls to initiate the desired movement of the powered exoskeleton, however it is important that the user be introduced to the device and made aware of how it functions as early as possible during the training process. Once comfortable in the device, the user takes over the controls and initiate their own movements.",
    "Equip the participant with a set of forearm crutches to assist with balance and maneuverability of the device. While seated in the exoskeleton, instruct the participant to place the tips of the crutches posteriorly in a manner allowing them the ability to push their weight over their feet. This ensures that the exoskeleton can extend the hip and knee joints performing most of the work during the standing maneuver.\n\tNote: Crutches are needed for all maneuvers in the device including standing, walking, turning, and sitting. Participants are not permitted to use the exoskeleton without the crutches. Some powered exoskeletons may allow the use of a walker or a cane to maintain balance.\nExplain the sit-to-stand procedure to the participant. Have one trainer assist from behind the user, and another guard from the front. Instruct the participant to stand on their own and only use trainer assistance as needed.\n\t\nInstruct the participant to place the crutches posteriorly and lean forward while pushing off the crutches to assist the device in standing them after pressing the \"Stand\" command.\n\t\tNote: Initially, encourage the user to concentrate on proper crutch placement while the trainer uses the controller to initiate the powered exoskeleton to standup.\n5. Standing Balance\nNote: The standing balance procedures were developed by the researchers at the JJPVAMC. There may be some procedures that are specific to the device used but most of the procedures should translate to other powered exoskeletons.\nAfter standing with a trainer guarding from behind, have the second trainer stand in front of the user and demonstrate the standing balance goals.\n\tNote: Measure blood pressure after standing and periodically during the training session to identify if an orthostatic hypotension or autonomic dysreflexia episode is experienced by the user.",
    "Before attempting to walk, ensure that the participant demonstrates the following capabilities:\n\t\nHave the participant demonstrate the ability to stand in \"home\" position using both crutches to maintain balance (Figure 1).\n\t\tNote: Place a mirror in front of the participant to provide visual feedback and help correct improper lean as well as maintain their upright balance in the \"home\" position.\nHave the participant practice slight shifting of their weight laterally and posteriorly to understand the location and feel of the home position.\nInstruct the participant to maintain balance with only one crutch (Figure 2). Instruct the participant to practice this action by lifting one crutch off of the ground and holding that stance for up to 1 minute. Instruct the participant to practice an additional one-handed balance exercise.\n\t\tNote: This maneuver is similar to the previous one but with the added complexity of having one arm balancing while the contralateral arm reaches over to touch the balancing arm's wrist, simulating selection of actions on the controller.\n\t\t\nRepeat these exercises to ensure the participant is able to perform these maneuvers using either arm to maintain balance.\nAfter practicing the standing crutch balance skills, teach the participant to weight shift laterally, allowing one foot to offload, with the goal to lift the foot completely off the ground for 5 sec. Instruct the user to repeat this exercise, trying to offload with the other leg.\nAsk the participant to weight shift in anterior and posterior directions while properly placing crutches fore and aft to maintain balance.\nRepeat exercises 5.2.2 - 5.2.5 five to ten times during the first session. Continue to practice these exercises during the following sessions until the user feels comfortable with them.\n6. Walking",
    "Note: The walking procedures are a mixture of procedure developed by the staff at the JJPVAMC and the manufacture of the device. The mechanism of walking inbuilt into the powered exoskeleton and the dual crutch pattern used in the device was developed by the manufacture; however the approach of teaching the participant how to properly execute the walking, mechanism of providing assistance and the outcome measure used to record the level of assistance was the efforts of the researchers at the JPVAMC. Although, some procedures are specific to the powered exoskeleton used, most of the procedures are translatable to other powered exoskeletons that use crutches to maintain balance.\nInstruct the participant in the mechanism of walking with the powered exoskeleton. The particular powered exoskeleton used requires the participant to shift their weight onto the left foot while simultaneously unweighting the right foot. Using the controller, the trainer selects the \"Walk\" mode and asks the participant to shift slightly forward (to a predetermined target); this will initiate forward swing of the right leg.\n\t\nInstruct the user that once the right leg has completed the swing, to move their crutches forward while simultaneously shifting their weight forward and to the right in order to maintain balance while stepping onto the right foot, and unweighting the left foot. Explain that the device, sensing the participant's movement, will initiate forward swinging of the left leg.\nPerform continuous walking by repeating the forward crutching motion and weight shifting sequence for each leg consecutively.\nEncourage the trainers to provide assistance as needed, however to do so minimally.\n\tNote: The level of assistance, determined by the functional independence measure (FIM)38, is assessed by the trainer and recorded.",
    "Spot the user by grasping the powered exoskeleton or the participant to provide support if needed. Correct the user as s/he performs the proper weight shifting while walking.\nIf needed, have a second trainer provide assistance and tactical feedback in an area of the body which the user has intact sensation (such as the shoulders).\n\t\tNote: Trainers are discouraged to provide assistance through the powered exoskeleton or below the level of injury because the user is not typically able to feel the assistance, which may lead to difficulty in learning to adjust their upper body to properly ambulate in the device.\nExplain to the user the mechanism for the powered exoskeleton to stop walking. The particular powered exoskeleton used is triggered to stop when it does not sense any more forward movement onto the contralateral limb, or if the user does not provide an appropriate weight shift allowing the swing leg to make contact with the floor.\n\tNote: Stopping at will or at a particular location is practiced and is one of the skills included in the training program.\n7. Progressive Goals of Mobility Training\nNote: The goals of the mobility training were developed at the JJPVAMC and incorporated within the criteria for evaluating proficiency to use the powered exoskeleton in the home environment by the manufacture.\nExplain and describe the list of mobility skills to be practiced as part of the training (Figure 3).\n\t\nInstruct the participant to use the controller of the powered exoskeleton and become as independent as possible using the powered exoskeleton.\n\t\tNote: The powered exoskeleton used in this trial had the controls integrated in a controller worn on the wrist.\nTeach the participant to make 90 and 180 degree turns while walking in the system.",
    "Instruct the participant to navigate to rest on a wall by stopping beside the wall and turning so their back can lean against it.\n\t\tNote: This allows the person to rest without the need to rely on the crutches for balance.\nIncorporate different walking surfaces during the training sessions so that the participant practices walking on additional surfaces such as carpet (Figure 4), concrete, asphalt, and grass (Figure 5).\nHave the participant walk on surfaces with varying slopes such as up a ramp, down a ramp, curb cutout and uneven surfaces (Figure 6). Then, have the participant walk in a noisy environment, such as a hallway with other pedestrians.\n\t\tNote: Walking in a noisy environment may be a challenge for some people since they are unable to hear the sound of the motors which provides an audio que for an appropriate time to weight shift.\nHave the participant stop on command or at will.\nPractice navigation of doorway thresholds, opening and closing of swinging doors, opening and closing doors from different sides, and walking through automatic and/or revolving doors (Figures 7 and 8).\n\t\tNote: The ability of performing these additional mobility skills are assessed as \"able\" or \"unable\" to perform the maneuver.\nIncorporate additional activities such as reaching over head into a cabinet (Figure 9) or outside sitting on and standing up from a park bench (Figure 10).\n8. Assessments of Walking\nNote: The walking assessments used are standard clinical tests that have been established by others.\nPerform a 6 min walk test (6MWT).\n\t\nHave the participant initiate walking and instruct the participant to continue walking.\nAfter 6 min ask the participant to stop.",
    "Note: The 6MWT39,40 is the distance that the participant is able to ambulate with the powered exoskeleton over a 6 min period of time. Should the participant accidentally trigger the device to stop walking during the 6MWT, the clock continues to record time and the participant is encouraged to regain his/her balance, composure, and re-start the device to continue walking as quickly as possible.\nPerform this test with a trainer dedicated to spotting and an additional trainer using a measuring wheel to determine the distance and a stop watch to measure the elapsed time.\nExpress the 6MWT in meters walked in 6 min and calculate the average walking speed (total meters walked in 6 min/360 sec) and express it as m/sec.\n\tNote: The 6MWT is the total distance traveled during a 6-min timed period and is obtained over the course of the training program. The 6MWT is the primary assessment used to determine the progression of walking skill in the exoskeleton. Perform the 6MWT test as soon as the participant understands the mechanism of walking with the powered exoskeleton and is able to take multiple steps.\nUse the lap function of the stopwatch during the 6MWT after covering a 10 m distance to record the 10 m time. Identify and record the best 10 m time achieved during the 6MWT.\n\tNote: The 10-meter walk test (10MWT)40 is the best effort time (seconds) it takes the participant to walk a 10 m distance, and is recorded while the person performs the 6MWT.\nUse the timed-up-and-go (TUG)40,41 test as an indicator of how much standing, walking turning, and sitting function the individual has.",
    "Perform the TUG test by measuring the time it takes the participant to stand up from a seated position, walk 10 feet, turn around, walk back and sit down again. Start the time once the person initiates the device to stand up and the time stops once the person is safely sitting in the seat.\n\t\tNote: The results of this measurement are not representative of the traditional TUG times because it incorporates the time allotted for proper crutch placement after the mode selector indicates standing is desired. The TUG measurement represents the person's ability to use the exoskeletal system since it incorporates multiple aspects of mobility in the device.\n9. Sitting\nNote: The procedures to sit down were developed by the manufacture of the device and may vary among the different exoskeletons. Clinicians should refer to the manufacture's procedures.\nPlace a chair behind the user when he or she is ready to sit. Using the controller of the exoskeleton, place the exoskeleton in sit mode.\n\tNote: Initially the trainer operates the controller during the sitting movement of the powered exoskeleton, however as with standing, it is important that the user be introduced to the controller and made aware of its functions as early as possible during the training program. Once comfortable in the device, the user is asked to operate the controller and initiate the movements.\nAfter activating/pressing the sit command there is a 5-second delay. During this time ask the participant to place their crutches posteriorly to maintain their center of balance over the chair. Have the participant practice the crutch placement task if this is the first few times performing the sitting function. After the 5-second delay has elapsed, the exoskeleton lowers the user down until sitting on the chair.",
    "During the sitting process the user will start to bend forward at the hip to maintain balance over the feet. Have the trainers assist the participant as needed.\n\tNote: Initially, practice sitting with two trainers, one spotting from behind, and the other in front. As the user becomes skilled in the maneuver and able to complete the maneuver with confidence and independence, only one trainer is needed.\n10. Doffing\nNote: The doffing procedures were developed by the manufacture of the device. The methodology of doffing the powered exoskeleton may vary among the different devices. Clinicians should refer to the manufacture's procedures.\nAfter seating, doff the device in a similar, but reverse manner as previously discussed in section three for donning the device.\n\t\nRelease the straps starting with the chest and hip and progress to the feet. Remove the participant's feet from the device. Encourage the participant to attempt the transfer into their wheelchair on their own, but provide assistance as needed.\nOnce back in their wheelchair, inspect the participant's feet, lower extremities, and lower back for any bruising or abrasions.\nTeach the participant to routinely check their lower extremities for signs of pressure points after they have completed their walking sessions."
