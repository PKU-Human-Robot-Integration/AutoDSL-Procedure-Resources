    "The following protocol describes the determination of Rs by using a prepacked column in a typical FPLC system (Figure 1). Buffers and other solutions are delivered via a system pump, and the sample can be load in different ways (e.g., by a syringe and a sample loop or by a sample pump). A detection system (e.g., UV/Vis absorbance, conductivity) is located after the column to control the separation process and the proteins are collected in the fraction collector. It is possible to operate the system manually, although the system is usually controlled by software. In particular, in the ÄKTA FPLC all data and parameters of the separation run are displayed in the System Control module of UNICORN software, which permits control of chromatography systems (e.g., system settings, run data, curves) and on-line monitoring of separation processes. Refer to the UNICORN User Reference Manual for software functionality.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170417/20170417190613_1097.jpgFigure 1. Typical FPLC system. A.

Note: Make sure that the back-pressure over the column does not exceed the maximum pressure value mandated by the manufacturer.Connect the column (injector outlet–column inlet and column outlet–detector) (Figure 2).Note: Make sure that there is no air in the valves and tubing prior to connecting the column to a chromatography system.",
    "Ensure that the inlet of the column is filled with liquid; connect it to the system in a drop-to-drop fashion (unscrew the inlet of the column, let the buffer flow through the system and drop to the inlet of the column; then, unscrew the outlet of the column and connect to the detector). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170417/20170417190725_8768.jpgFigure 2.

B. Detail of the column outlet and its connection to the detectors.When using the column after prolonged storage or for the first time equilibrate the column as follows:At least 2 times the volume of the column (2x column volumes) of MilliQ water at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Columns are usually stored in 20% ethanol, which produce high back pressures, so the initial flow rates should not exceed half the maximum recommended flow rate. Since ethanol might cause precipitation of the salts used in the mobile phase, it is advisable to flow MilliQ water until complete ethanol removal before proceeding with the equilibration.2x column volumes of mobile phase (eluent) at a flow rate of 0.5-1 ml/min. Note: The eluent should be chosen to ensure full sample solubility. In order to avoid any unwanted ionic interactions between the matrix and the solute molecules, the use of a buffer with an ionic strength equivalent or greater to 0.15 M NaCl or KCl is recommended. The manufacturer usually provides a list of some useful eluent compositions for a given column. Connect the loop (100 μl loop size) to injection valve. Wash the loop by injection with MilliQ water (at least 5 times the volume of the loop).",
    "Repeat the wash with the protein’s eluent (according to the column used). Prepare the samples and remove particulate material from protein solution by either centrifuging (10,000 x g for 15 min) or filtering samples through a 0.22 µm filter.The sample is injected through the injection valve which has two positions, load and inject. When the valve is set on load, the loop can be filled with the sample (Figure 3A, blue line) and the eluent is being bypassed to the column (Figure 3A, green line). When the valve is set on inject, the eluent flows through the loop and moves the sample to the column (Figure 3B, green line). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170417/20170417190916_4446.jpgFigure 3. Schematic representation of the injection valve in the load (A) and inject (B) positionsDetermine the void volume by loading blue dextran (200-300 μl at 1-2 mg/ml dissolved in the mobile phase, see Recipes) to the column via loop. This concentration of blue dextran will give an absorbance at 280 nm (A280) of 0.5-1 in the peak fraction. Dextran blue can also be used to control column packing. Note: An excess of sample is used to ensure that the sample loop is filled completely (complete filling method). To achieve 95% of maximum loop volume about 2 to 3 loop volumes of sample are necessary. Before injection, make sure the flow rate is correctly set and that the injection valve is set to ‘load’. Load the syringe with the sample (2-3 times the loop volume) and expel the air bubbles. It may be necessary to flick the syringe to push the bubbles up. Gently inject the syringe contents into the loop. Leave the syringe in position and set the injection valve to ‘Inject’.",
    "The ideal volume loads correspond to sample volumes between 1-2% of the total column volume to obtain sharp peaks. Additionally, solutions containing high protein concentrations (> 2 mg/ml) can lead to increased viscosity and hence decreased diffusion coefficients of solutes (Ricker and Sandoval, 1996).The typical flow rate is 0.5-1 ml/min, although by decreasing the flow rate in SEC experiments, greater resolution can be obtained on a given column (refer to the manufacturer’s recommendation for flow rate).Inject an aliquot of 200-300 μl of acetone at 5 mg/ml (0.63% v/v dissolved in the mobile phase, see Recipes) into the column to determine the total volume available to the mobile phase. Detection of acetone is possible at 280 nm.Prepare a mixture of selected standard proteins by dissolving them in the eluent buffer at 0.5-1 mg/ml (or at concentrations indicated by the manufacturer, see Recipes). Check for protein complete dissolution before applying to the column and then determine Ve for each protein standard. Note: Typically, five protein standards are sufficient to obtain a good calibration plot. It is possible to use more than one standard in the same run (only if the peaks of the different standards are completely resolved). The standards must be chosen accurately, taking into account the fractionation range of the selected column.Apply the protein sample (200-300 μl at 1 mg/ml) with the unknown Rs and determine the corresponding Ve.Note: For determination of Ca2+-dependent change in Rs of Ca2+ sensor proteins, the sample protein must be loaded first in the absence and then in the presence of Ca2+. Apo conditions include 5 mM Tris, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 5 mM EGTA at pH 7.5, while Ca2+-saturated conditions include 5 mM Tris, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, and 5 mM CaCl2 at pH 7.5.",
    "If the column has to be stored, wash it with 2x column volumes of MilliQ water and then at least 2x column volumes of 20% ethanol. Store at 4 °C. Note: For column data, cleaning-in-place conditions, column performance controls, buffers, and solvent resistance always refer to the manufacturer’s instructions."
