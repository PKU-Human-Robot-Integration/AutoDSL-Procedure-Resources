    "Sample preparationSample preparation for microwave digestion – ICP-MSThe lichen samples (> 200 g per sample, fresh weight) are air-dried at room temperature in paper bags for at least 5 days. Carefully remove soil particles and other debris on lichen thalli under a stereo microscope using clean tweezers.The cleaned samples are oven-dried at 70 °C for 72 h to constant weight (determined by weighting each sample at an interval of 8-12 h). Cool down the samples to room temperature and ground each sample to powder in a grinding mill, then pass each sample through a 10 mesh nylon sieve.Transfer an accurately weighted portion of each sample (0.3000 g) to a Teflon digestion vessel. Add 4.0 ml HNO3 to the vessel and incubate for 4 h at room temperature. Then add 2.0 ml H2O2, and transfer the digestion vessel to a microwave digestion system (MARS-X), applying the following temperature control procedure (Table 1).Table 1. Temperature control procedure for microwave digestionimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170301/20170301082426_4251.jpgAfter digestion, when the pressure inside the vessel lowered to normal pressure and the vessel is cooled down to room temperature, open the vessel and wash the sample into a 50 ml volumetric flask by using deionized water (20-40 ml). Dilute the sample to 50 ml with deionized water for ICP-MS testing.Prepare blank samples and certified reference material samples (IAEA-336, GBW10010, GBW10014 and GBW10015) according to the above mentioned procedures.Sample preparation for microwave digestion – ICP-MSTransfer an accurately weighted portion of each sample (1.0000 g) of the lichen (obtained in step A1b) to a nickel crucible and then all samples are heated to 500 °C until they turn grayish white (and therefore are fully ashed).Add 1.5 g of NaOH to decompose each sample at 700 °C for 10 min.",
    "Cool down all samples to room temperature and wash each sample into a 50 ml plastic centrifuge tube using hot deionized water (70-80 °C, 20-30 ml). To ensure complete transfer of each sample, also wash the nickel crucible according to the method mentioned above. Dilute the solution in the tube to 50 ml and shake it well before ICP-AES testing.Prepare blank samples and certified reference material samples (IAEA-336, GBW10010, GBW10014 and GBW10015) according to the procedures mentioned above.Measurement of element concentrations in lichensICP-MS analysisSet the optimal operating conditions for ICP-MS (Table 2).Table 2.
