    "The protocol has been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Wayne State University.\n1. Experimental preparation\nUse a 70% ethanol solution to clean and sterilize the scissors and tweezers. Also, prepare disposable pipettes and a syringe.\nPrepare a wash medium by adding 3.595 g of NaCl to 495 mL of deionized water. Then, add 5 ml of Penicillin-Streptomycin (5 U/mL) to the medium. Fill a 100 mm Petri dish with the wash medium and warm it to 37 °C.\nPrepare culture dishes according to Figure 1, which illustrates the overall configuration.\n\t\nPrepare a piece of filter paper, cut it into a rectangular shape of approximately 17 mm × 20 mm, and remove the four corners. Create a hollow center in the filter paper, approximately 7 mm × 10 mm in size for securing the embryo (Figure 1, left).\n\t\tNOTE: The collection of embryos is described in step 2.\nAttach a commercial available ring (Φ = 1 inch, see Table of Materials) with a flexible film (i.e., paraffin film) layer, ensuring that the flexible film also has a hollow center. This ring with the film will be used to hold the filter paper with the embryo.\nFinally, place the prepared ring into a 35 mm Petri dish (Figure 1, right).",
    "​NOTE: The filter paper is for securing and holding the extracted embryo by placing the filter paper on the membrane and leaving the embryo in the center hollow area (which will be detailed in step 2). The four corners were cut to fit the size of the outside ring (not necessary if it is already fitted). A 35 mm glass-bottom culture dish is used for better laser beam propagation. The dish has an inner well (Φ = 23 mm), which can be filled with albumen for ex ovo culture. The diameter of the ring must be larger than the diameter of the inner well so that the well can be covered by the flexible film on the ring (Figure 1, inset). The size of the filter paper is not restricted and can be modified according to the size of the chosen ring and the culture dish. Alternatively, the bottom of the dish can be pre-coated with an agarose layer (thickness: ~1 mm). By removing agarose from the center of the layer using a blade, a well with a similar shape to the hollow center of the flexible film can be created for loading albumen. One critical point is that the four sides of the hollow filter paper need to have enough width (> 5 mm) to ensure the attachment of the embryo.\n2. Extraction and ex ovo culture of the chicken embryo\nNOTE: This step is modified from previously published reports40,41.\nAfter pre-culture, retrieve the egg from the incubator and place it on its long axis on the egg carton tray. Clean the eggshell with 70% ethanol, ensuring to cover the entire surface, and then allow it to rest for 15 min.",
    "Hold the egg on its short axis and crack it at the bottom. Open the egg over a clean 100 mm Petri dish to extract its contents, as illustrated in Figure 2. Ensure not to rotate the egg while holding and cracking it.\nUsing a pipette, transfer and collect approximately 10 mL of the thin albumen (i.e., the liquid albumen42) into a 15 mL tube for ex ovo culture use. Fill the center well of the culture dish with the collected thin albumen (about 0.9 mL), as shown in Figure 3. The filling process should be slow, avoiding the formation of any bubbles inside the well. Ensure that the culture dish with albumen is warmed to 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: This dish will be used for culturing the embryo ex ovo. New culture dishes filled with wash medium will be used during Brillouin imaging (see step 3).\nUsing tissue paper, gently remove the thick albumen (i.e., viscous albumen) attached to the embryo by carefully separating the albumen from the vitelline membrane, as demonstrated in Figure 4. Avoid direct contact with the vitelline membrane.\nAfter removing all the thick albumen, carefully affix the filter paper to the vitelline membrane. Ensure the body axis of the embryo aligns with the long axis of the center rectangle on the filter paper. Use scissors to cut the membrane surrounding the filter paper.\nUsing tweezers, gently pull the isolated filter paper away from the yolk in an oblique direction. Flip the filter paper upside down to position the embryo with its dorsal side down (for inverted microscope configuration). Carefully immerse the entire filter paper from one side of the long axis into the 100 mm Petri dish with the wash medium in an oblique fashion.",
    "Wash away any remaining yolk by gently spraying the wash medium parallel to the filter paper using a clean pipette. Avoid directly spraying the wash medium onto the membrane.\nAfter clearing all the yolk, carefully remove the filter paper from the wash medium and use tissue paper to absorb any excess medium from the edges. Then, place the filter paper with the embryo onto the culture dish, ensuring that the dorsal side of the embryo is facing downward, as illustrated in Figure 5. To maintain humidity, place a moistened tissue paper in the dish.\nTransfer the culture dish to the on-stage incubator for ex ovo culture.\n3. Brillouin measurement of the embryo\nPrepare another set of culture dishes and fill them with wash medium. Ensure the wash medium is warmed to 37 °C.\nWhen the embryo reaches the desired developmental stage, transfer the filter paper with the embryo to the culture dish filled with wash medium. Place the culture dish into the on-stage incubator of the Brillouin microscope (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nBefore conducting the Brillouin measurement, save a bright-field image of the entire embryo for reference. The detailed configuration of the Brillouin microscope has been previously described30 and is summarized in the Results section (Figure 6).\nMeasure the Brillouin signal of water and methanol, which will be used in step 4 for the calibration process.\nAdjust the incident laser power and electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD, see Table of Materials) camera exposure time to achieve at least 10,000 counts of Brillouin signal. Using the bright-field image as a guide, set up the scan range and step size. Acquire a Brillouin image of the region of interest by scanning the embryo using a 2D translational stage.",
    "NOTE: The horizontal scanning range can be determined based on the bright-field image, and the vertical (i.e., depth) scanning range can be determined based on the signal strength obtained from a quick and coarse scan. To prevent any photodamage to the embryo, limit the incident power to 25 mW, and set the exposure time of the EMCCD camera to 50 ms. Choose a step size of 2 µm in the horizontal direction and 1 µm in the vertical direction to balance imaging quality and acquisition time.\nAfter completing the scan, carefully remove the filter paper with the embryo and use tissue paper to absorb any excess wash medium. Then, place the filter paper back into the culture dish filled with thin albumen for continuous culturing in the on-stage incubator.\nRepeat steps 3.2-3.5 at regular time intervals (e.g., 1.5 h) to capture time-lapse Brillouin images as the embryo develops.\nReconstruct the 2D Brillouin image following step 4.\n4. Brillouin image reconstruction\nCalibrate the Brillouin spectrometer using Brillouin signals of water and methanol to calculate the free spectral range (FSR) and the pixel-to-frequency conversion ratio (PR) of the spectrometer30. The calibrated values of FSR and PR will be used to calculate the Brillouin shift of the embryo at each pixel.\n\tNOTE: Figure 7A displays a raw Brillouin spectrum captured by the EMCCD camera. By vertically summing the spectrum and then doing a Lorentzian fitting, the peak distance Δd of the two dots can be obtained (Figure 7B). By getting the peak distance of water Δdwater and methanol Δdmethanol, the FSR and PR can be computed based on the equations30: PR = 2·(ωmethanol-ωwater)/(Δdwater- Δdmethanol), and FSR = 2·ωwater + PR·Δdwater, with the known Brillouin shift of water ωwater = 6.01 GHz and methanol ωmethanol = 4.49 GHz at 660 nm.",
    "Obtain the peak distance of the Brillouin signal at each pixel of the sample. Calculate the Brillouin shift based on the calibrated FSR and PR: ωsample = 0.5 (FSR - PR x Δdsample)30, where ωsample is the Brillouin shift of the sample, and Δdsample is the peak distance of the Brillouin signal.\nReconstruct the 2D Brillouin image based on the Brillouin shifts of all pixels.\n\tNOTE: To conduct local analysis, one can select a region of interest (e.g., the neural plate) from the acquired Brillouin image and quantify its mechanical properties. A common approach is to calculate the average Brillouin shift of the selected region.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
