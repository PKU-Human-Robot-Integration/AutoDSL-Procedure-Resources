    "Ethics statement: The human placenta study was conducted prospectively, with the approval of the Institutional Review Board for human research of the Korea University (AN09085-001). All experiments were performed in a Clean Germ-Free Room facility at the Korea University Medical Center. The experimental design and procedures using hPSCs were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Korea University Medical Center (AN12277-003).\n1. Preparation of Instruments, Culture Media, and Dishes\nCoat all the culture dishes with 0.1% gelatin. Autoclave phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and forceps. Sterilize surgical scissors, microcentrifuge tubes, and gauze at 121 °C under 15lb psi for more than 15 min.\nPrepared pre-warmed 0.25% trypsin-ethylene amine tetra-acetic acid (trypsin-EDTA) and pre-warmed filtered culture media (DMEM) containing 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin before commencing procedures.\n2. Cell Isolation from Human Placenta\nObtain placental tissue, after caesarean section delivery, from healthy pregnant women undergoing normal or therapeutic abortion at 7–32 weeks of gestation after obtaining written informed consent.\nHave the obstetric specialist surgically separate human placenta chorionic plates (HPCs) from the placenta; incubate these in 0.25% trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 20 min, and then wash with 5 ml PBS.\nIsolate chorionic villi from HPCs using scissors; mince the villi and wash them three times with 1ml PBS. After mincing, place the chorionic villi into a microfuge tube using a pipette tip; wash the samples with 500 µl PBS by pipetting up and down, and centrifuge the tubes for 120 x g for 3 min. Wash tissues twice with 500 µl of pre-warmed culture medium.",
    "Culture cells in medium on gelatin-coated plates at 37 °C, in 5% CO2, and under 95% humidity. Pre-coat all plates with 0.1% gelatin for 1 hr at 37 °C. Colonies of fibroblast-like cells will form and adherent growth approximately 5–7 days after commencing culture in the same medium.\nExchange the medium every 2–3 days until the third passage. During culture, removing cell debris floating in the culture medium; growing placental fibroblasts will attach to the plate. Culture the fibroblast-like cells derived from the HPC up to the 10th passage and then harvest them for hESC cultures after trypsinization and mitomycin-C (10 µg/ml) treatment.\nBefore freezing HPCs as stock samples, use reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to confirm that HPCs are not contaminated with pathogens that commonly infect the placenta, including mycoplasma (M. fermentans, M. hyorhinis, M. Arginine, M. orale, M. salivarium, M. hominis, M. pulmonis, M. arthritidis, M. neurolyticum, M. hyopneumoniae, and M. capricolum) and the bacterial species, Ureaplasmaurealyticum, by using a mycoplasma detection kit.\n\t\nFollow the manufacturer’s instructions to perform RT-PCR, use all primers and mixtures provided in the kit. Use the supernatants of the cells that have been cultivated for 36 days for mycoplasma detection. Add 3 µl of these samples to the PCR mixtures and perform the 1st PCR procedure for 35 cycles, each consisting of 94 °C for 30 sec, 55 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min.\nCarefully add 0.5 µl of the 1st PCR product to the PCR mixture and perform the 2nd PCR procedure for 30 cycles using the same conditions as before. Analyze the amplified products by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis; apply 10 µl of each of the 1st and 2nd PCR products to the gels.",
    "If HPCs are found to be contaminated with pathogens, eliminate these using a combination of antibiotics (BM-Cyclin), following the manufacturer's instructions. Add new medium containing 10 µg/ml of BM-Cyclin 1 for 3 days, and then treat the cells with 5 µg/ml BM-Cyclin 2 for another 4 days. Repeat this cycle twice and then check for mycoplasma contamination again.\n3. Harvesting Human Placenta-derived Cells Conditioned Medium (hPCCM)\nAfter excluding contamination, treat the attached cells (85-90% confluence; (1.5 × 107 cells/flask) with mitomycin-C (10 µg/ml) for 2 hr and 30 min, and washed the cells three times with 10 ml PBS. Incubate the cells with pre-warmed medium without mitomycin-C for 24 hr.\nOne day after treatment, incubate cells in 10 ml medium (DMEM-F12 supplemented with 20% Knock-Out Serum Replacement [KOSR], 0.1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1% NEAA, and 1% penicillin–streptomycin). After 24 hr of incubation, harvest CM in a 15-ml conical tube and filter the CM using a 0.22 µm syringe filter.\nAdd another 10 ml of new medium and incubation. Collect all supernatants from the cultures every day for 1 week and freeze the harvested medium at –80 °C. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\n4. Culture of Human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs) and Induction of Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)\nObtain Human embryonic stem cell lines, H1 and H9 cells (listed in the NIH hESC registry under the name WA01 and WA09, respectively) and induced-pluripotent stem cell iPSC-1: iPS(foreskin)-1 and iPSC-2 (IISH1i-BM) from the WiCell Research Institute (Madison, WI, USA). Cells should be thawed and cultured following the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "For the control group, culture cells on Basement Membrane Matrix-coated dishes in widely used feeder-free and serum-free defined culture medium at 37 °C and in 5% CO2. Initially, seed 80-100 clumps of hPSCs in 35-mm dishes. Grow cells in these dishes until 70-80% confluence and routinely passage cells for sub-culturing once every 5–6 days, using mechanical or enzymatic methods (Dispase). Wash cells twice with medium and plate them at a ratio of 1:4. Replace the medium with fresh medium every day.\nFor the experimental groups, culture cells in hPCCM on dishes pre-coated with 0.1% gelatin and perform routine passaging once every 5 days, either mechanically or enzymatically. Plate cells at ratios in the range of 1:6–1:10. hPSCs attach to the gelatin within 2 days after transfer. Replace the medium with fresh medium daily.\n5. Characterization of Human Pluripotent Stem Cells\nNOTE: Characterize hPSCs using several methods, such as alkaline phosphatase staining, immunocytochemistry, Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and western blotting.\nImmunofluorescence staining\n\t\nFor immunofluorescence staining, culture hPSCs and fix the cells in 8-well slide chambers with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min; then, permeabilized the cells with 0.1% (v/v) Triton-X100 for 15 min, and block the cells for 1 hr with 3% (v/v) normal horse serum in PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20. Wash PBS twice for 5 min between every step.\nIncubate cells with the primary antibody (OCT-4, SSEA4, TRA-1-81, TRA-1-60, dilution of 1:1,000) O/N at 4 °C and with the secondary antibody.\nBefore mounting, incubate cells with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for 5 min in the dark. Wash cells stringently three times for 5 min each and dry cells completely, in the dark. Preserve cells in fluorescence mounting medium and observe them under a fluorescence microscope.\nqRT-PCR",
    "Isolate total RNA from cells using an RNeasy mini kit according to manufacturer's specifications and quantify the extracted RNA using a Nano Drop Spectrophotometer.\nSynthesize cDNA by adding 2 µg of the total RNA to a 20-µl reaction mixture containing oligo(dT) primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase; follow the manufacturer’s instructions in this procedure.\nAmplify the synthesized cDNA with a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ system, using iQ SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix and the primer sequences described in Supplemental Table S1. Normalize the cycle threshold values of the genes of interest to those of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).\nAlkaline phosphatase (AP) staining\n\t\nDetect AP activity using the ES Cell Characterization Kit, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nOn day 5, aspirate the media and fix the hPSCs with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 12 min. Do not overfix; fixing cells for longer than 2 min will result in the inactivation of alkaline phosphatase. Aspirate the fixative and rinse with 1x Rinse Buffer. Do not allow wells to dry between steps.\nAdd enough staining solution to cover each well (1 ml per well of a 35 mm dish). Incubate plates in the dark at RT for 15 min.\nAfter incubation, wash dishes with 1x Rinse Buffer. Cover cells with 1x PBS to prevent drying and examine and image the stained cells using an Olympus microscope.\nWestern Blot\n\t\nPerform western blot analysis as previously described in9. Briefly, determine protein concentrations in cell lysates. Resolve equal amounts of protein on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gel and transfer the proteins onto a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane.",
    "Block the blot and probe it O/N with different primary antibodies at 4 °C; subsequently incubate the blot with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hr. Wash the membrane three times for 10 min each time between incubations. Detect signals using an ECL reagent.\nShort Tandem Repeat (STR) Analysis\n\t\nhPSCs were harvested from the control and experimental groups at the same passage. Genomic DNA was extracted using a DNA Micro kit, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nAmplify the genomic DNA for 16 different genetic loci using the AmpF/STR PCR Amplification Kit, according to the manufacturer’s specifications and capillary electrophoresis was performed using a Genetic Analyzer.\nSubscription Required.
