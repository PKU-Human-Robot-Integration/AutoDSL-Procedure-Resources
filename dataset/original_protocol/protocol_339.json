  "procedures": [
    "1. Activation of polystyrene surface\n  \nThe wells of a polystyrene microtiter plate were activated by FNAB under UV light for 15 min at a wavelength of 365 nm as described earlier \\(6).   \n2. Detection of analyte\n  \nIn activated and untreated polystyrene microtiter plates,  analyte \\(rabbit IgG, human IgE, Epicoccum nigrum ) was detected by immobilizing capture molecule \\(anti-rabbit IgG, anti-human IgE, Epicoccum nigrum antigen) onto the activated and untreated polystyrene microtiter plates followed by blocking , binding  of analyte  and secondary antibody-conjugate. The plates were washed by washing buffer after each step. Color development was carried out by adding substrate dye buffer. After 30 min, 50 Âµl of 2 M NaOH were added to stop the colour development. Absorbance was recorded at 405 nm in an ELISA reader."
