    "The specimens from human tissue were collected according to the Declaration of Helsinki while observing University Hospital Federico II guidelines. All patients involved in this study provided written consent.\n1. Preparation of Supplies and Culture Media\nClean and autoclave one large pair of surgical scissors, two sets of fine forceps, two pairs of microdissecting scissors, 1 L sterile bottle, 500 mL sterile bottle, and a 250 mL sterile bottle.\nPrepare 100 mm plates, 60 mm plates, 35 mm plates, disposable scalpels, 50 mL sterile tubes, 15 mL sterile tubes, and a 100 mm glass plate. Store instruments under sterile conditions until ready for use.\nClean and sterilize 22 mm x 22 mm cover glasses before use. For this, place cover glasses in a glass plate, cover them with 70% ethanol and wait for a few seconds before aspirating the ethanol. Let cover glasses dry in an oven at 37 °C and then autoclave them.\nPrepare 1 L of Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) at pH 7.4 by dissolving commercially available powdered salts in double-distilled sterile water and adding 0.35 g of sodium bicarbonate. Sterilize by filtration under a sterile hood and store at +4 °C until use.\nPrepare 500 mL of sterile 1x phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS) by dissolving 0.1 g of potassium phosphate monobasic, 0.1 g of potassium chloride, 4.0 g of sodium chloride and 0.575 g of sodium phosphate dibasic in sterile double-distilled water. Check the pH value (7.4) and sterilize under a sterile hood by filtration. Store at +4 °C until use.\nPrepare 50 mL of trypsin stop solution (TSS) by adding 5 mL of 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to 45 mL of HBSS under a sterile hood. Store at +4 °C until use.",
    "Prepare the Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium for fibroblast isolation (I-DMEM) using 250 mL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.5% penicillin and streptomycin (pen/strep) under a sterile hood. Store at +4 °C until use.\nPrepare the DMEM for fibroblasts synchronization (S-DMEM) using 250 mL of DMEM supplemented with 0.1% FBS and 0.5% pen/strep under a sterile hood. Store at +4 °C until use.\n2. Isolation of Human Dermal Fibroblasts\nNOTE: Steps 2.1 to 2.3 reported below must be performed under a sterile hood. A cylindrical sample measuring about 0.8 cm in diameter yields 2 x 106 fibroblasts at passage 1.\nWash the freshly obtained sample of human skin from abdomen in a 100 mm dish with HBSS solution. Gently shake to remove blood and other biological fluids. Repeat the step three times, changing the HBSS solution and the plate at each wash.\nPlace the sample in a 100 mm plate, remove hair and fat using fine forceps and scissors, and dissect it with a scalpel to obtain 2 mm x 1 mm fragments (for a total of 16 fragments) avoiding scars, dirty (e.g., as resulting from drawings with dermographic pen) or burned areas of the tissue.\nPlace 4 small fragments in each 35 mm dish, cover with a sterile 22 mm x 22 mm cover glass. Adjust by the means of fine forceps. Add 1.5 mL of I-DMEM.\nIncubate the plates at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for about 15 days or until cells reach 85% confluence. Change the culture medium every 3 days and check the outgrowth of cells using an inverted phase-contrast microscope daily.\n3. Expansion of Human Skin Fibroblasts\nNOTE: The steps reported below must be performed under a sterile hood except the steps performed in the incubator.",
    "Lift the cover glasses with fine forceps, place them upside-down in one 100 mm dish and wash with 1x sterile PBS.\nRemove fragments of the samples and discard them, wash plates with 1x sterile PBS.\nRemove 1x PBS and add 3 mL and 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) to cover glasses placed in the 100 mm dish and 35 mm dishes, respectively. Incubate for 5 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nBlock the trypsinization by adding 5 mL of TSS to the 100 mm dish and 2 mL of TSS to each 35 mm dish. Collect the suspension into 15 mL sterile tubes, centrifuge at 400 x g at 4 °C for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 12 mL of I-DMEM. Split the cell suspension into 3 mL aliquots for each 60 mm plate.\nIncubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Change the medium daily. Keep cells in culture until they reach a confluence of 75%.\nAspirate the medium from the plates and quickly wash in 1x PBS.\nRepeat trypsinization (steps 3.3 and 3.4) three times to obtain cells at passage 4. Use 1.5 mL of trypsin-EDTA and 3 mL of TSS in each 60 mm dish. Split the cells 1:3.\nSynchronize the cells by replacing the I-DMEM with S-DMEM and incubate for 48 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nPrepare the following (during the cell synchronization).\n\t\nPrepare fibroblast expansion medium by adding 5.0 mL of FBS and 0.5 mL of L-glutamine to 44.5 mL of advanced DMEM (A-DMEM), store at +4 °C.\nPrepare total NM-RNA-reprogramming cocktail for fibroblast reprogramming by combining the following in each of 9 sterile RNase-free tubes: 32 µL of OSKMNL NM-RNA, 24 µL of EKB NM-RNA, 5.6 µL of NM-microRNAs (61.6 µL final volume for 9 aliquots).",
    "Divide each tube of 61.6 µL of total NM-RNA-reprogramming cocktail for fibroblast reprogramming into four 15.4 µL single-use aliquots in sterile, RNase-free tubes and store at -80 °C (15.4 µL final volume for 36 aliquots).\n4. Reprogramming of Dermal Fibroblasts to iPSCs\nDay 0: Cell seeding\n\tNOTE: Steps 4.1.1 to 4.1.3 and 4.1.8 to 4.1.9 must be performed under a sterile hood. Basement membrane matrix (BMM) gels rapidly at room temperature. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to thaw BMM overnight on ice in a refrigerator, dilute it with ice-cold serum-free medium and use pre-cooled pipets, tips, and tubes.\n\t\nPrepare a 24-well plate by coating each well with 100 µL of BMM and incubate for at least 1 h at 37 °C before seeding the cells.\nAspirate the medium from plates with cells in culture and quickly wash in 1x PBS.\nRepeat trypsinization (steps 3.3 and 3.4) to obtain cells at passage 5. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in an appropriate volume of fibroblasts expansion medium (see step 3.10).\nPrepare and clean the hemocytometer with 70% alcohol.\nPrepare a solution by gently mixing 10 µl of trypan blue and 10 µL of cell suspension in 1.5 mL tube, and incubate for 1–2 min at room temperature. Be careful not to incubate longer than 5 min.\nPipette 10 µL of the solution into the hemocytometer place it on the stage of an inverted phase contrast microscope to count. Non-viable cells will be blue, while viable cells will be unstained.\nCount the cells in at least 2 squares of the hemocytometer chamber. Apply the following calculation to obtain the total number of cells:\ntotal number of cells = (total number of counted cells/square number) x 2 x 10 x total volume of cell suspension",
    "Perform a dilution to obtain a density of 2.5 x 104 cell per 500 µL of fibroblasts expansion medium, based on the total number of counted cells. Resuspend the pellet in an appropriate volume of fibroblasts expansion medium.\nPipette 500 µL of the cell suspension into each well of the 24-well plate. Incubate cells overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nDay 1: Transfection\n\tNOTE: All working surfaces and supplies (e.g., gloves, bottles, sterile hood surfaces, pipettors) MUST be cleaned with cleaning reagent for removing RNase before starting the procedure. Perform steps 4.2.2, 4.2.4–4.2.8 under a sterile hood.\n\t\nWarm up xeno-free, serum-free,low growth factor human ESC/iPSC culture medium (XF/FF culture medium) in a 37 °C water bath.\nRemove the old medium from each well and replace it with 500 µL of pre-warmed XF/FF culture medium.\nIncubate at 37 °C under 5% CO2 for at least 6 h.\nThaw five 15.4 µL aliquots of total NM-RNA reprogramming cocktail at room temperature then place it on ice.\nAdd 234.6 µL of reduced-serum medium to each aliquot, gently pipette 3–5 times and label each one as TUBE A (RNA + reduced-serum medium).\nLabel 5 sterile, RNase-free 0.5 mL tubes as TUBE B and mix 6 µL of synthetic siRNA transfection reagent with 244 µL of reduced-serum medium (RNA-transfection reagent + reduced-serum medium).\nAdd the contents of each TUBE B to a TUBE A dropwise (to obtain 500 µL final volume of NM-RNA transfection complex solution). Mix by tapping the bottom of the tube. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min.",
    "Add 125 µL of NM-RNA transfection complex solution from each of the five aliquots of 500 µL to 4 wells (to reach a total of 20 wells), tilting the plate and pipetting dropwise into the medium. Mix by rocking gently. Use the remaining 4 wells as a reference.\nIncubate for 15 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nDay 2–4: Complete the transfection\nAspirate the medium. Repeat the transfection procedure as on day 1 under the sterile hood.\nDay 5–10: Media changes\nAspirate the medium and exchange with fresh, pre-warmed XF/FF culture medium under a sterile hood.\nIncubate overnight at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nKeep in culture until observing the formation of iPSC colonies monitoring daily by a phase-contrast microscope.\nSubscription Required.
