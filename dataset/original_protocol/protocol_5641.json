    "For this protocol, we used plant expression vectors, with leader signal sequences providing their localization in various compartments of plant cells. The vectors were obtained according to the procedure described earlier (Tyurin et al., 2017).Cultivation, transformation and selection of A. tumefaciens Seed cells of the A. tumefaciens strain GV3101 strain using an inoculation loop in 5 ml оf LB medium containing rifampicin (50 μg/ml), gentamicin (25 μg/ml), and carbenicillin (50 μg/ml), (antibiotics do not affect the efficiency of plant transformation) and grow overnight at 28 °C in a shaker incubator (~140 pm).Transfer the bacterial culture to 95 ml of LB medium without antibiotics and grow to an optical density of OD600 = 0.5-0.6, at 28 °C in a shaker incubator (~140 pm).Centrifuge cells at 3,500 x g for 5 min, at room temperature. Resuspend the pellet in 20 ml of cold (0 °C) solution 1 (see Recipes).Centrifuge cells at 3,500 x g for 5 min, at room temperature. Resuspend the pellet in 2 ml of solution 2 (see Recipes).Competent cells should be used for transformation immediately.Add 1 µg of an expression vector (with the kanamycin resistance gene) to the competent cells. Incubate cells on ice for 20 min. Heat the solution for 5 min at 37 °C in the shaker incubator. Place cells for 5 min on ice, add 2 ml of LB medium without antibiotics and incubate at 28 °C in the shaker incubator (~140 rpm) for 2 h.Plate transformed cells on Petri dishes in the medium containing 50 µg/ml of the selective antibiotic kanamycin (use the appropriate selective agent at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer). Isolate colonies and resuspend the cells in 100-150 μl of LB medium without antibiotics, and then freeze them.",
    "Plant materialGrow Nicotiana benthamiana at 20 ± 2 °C, a photoperiod of 8 h, and an illumination of 100 μmol quanta/(m2 sec) in soil or hydroponics using Knop’s solution (see Recipes) as a nutrient medium for 6 weeks. Frequency of use: 2 times per week.Agroinfiltration of the N. benthamiana plantsThaw frozen A. tumefaciens cells and grow them for 48 h at 27 °C in LB medium containing rifampicin (50 μg/ml), gentamicin (25 μg/ml), and carbenicillin (50 μg/ml) in the shaker incubator (~140 pm). Replace the medium with LB medium containing the same antibiotics and solution 3 (see Recipes). Grow the cells to an optical density of OD600 = 0.8. Centrifuge the cells at 3,000 x g for 5 min, at room temperature. Resuspend the pellet in agroinfiltration buffer (see Recipes) to an optical density of OD600 = 2.4.Infiltrate the cells into abaxial epiderm of 6-week-old N. benthamiana leaves using a syringe without a needle (Figure 1). Estimate the quality of transformation on the 4th day after agroinfiltration by imaging of the zones with an expression of the desC-egfp hybrid gene in tobacco leaves at 312 nm, using an ETX transilluminator (Vilber Lourmat). Cut the high fluorescence regions of tobacco leaves out for protoplast extraction (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180211/20180211010733_3658.jpgFigure 1.

GFP fluorescence in agroinfiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The agrobacteria carrying the expression cassettes of GFP fusion protein were syringe-infiltrated into an N. benthamiana leaf, and GFP fluorescence was observed 4 days after infiltration (dpi) in UV light. Fluorescence fields are marked with dashed lines. Scale bar = 20 mm.Protoplast isolationPrepare solution 4 (see Recipes) for the cell wall maceration immediately before use and clarify it by centrifugation.",
    "Use the leaf fragments with fluorescence for protoplast isolation according to Nosov et al. (2014). Mince the leaves (about 500 mg) with a scalpel. Add 5 ml of solution 4.Isolate the protoplasts at 15 °C in a shaker (50 rpm) for 12 h.Filtrate the protoplast suspension through nylon mesh (pore size, 40 µm). Transfer the protoplast suspension into 10-ml centrifuge tubes and centrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Resuspend the pellet of protoplasts in 10 ml of solution 5 and incubate for 5 min at room temperature, and then centrifuge at 100 x g for 5 min, repeat the procedure two times. Resuspend the pellet of protoplasts in 1.5 ml of solution 5 (see Recipes).Protoplast imaging Perform the imaging of zones with target protein in freshly isolated protoplasts with an Axio Imager Z2 microscope (ZEISS) equipped with an AxioCam MR digital camera and filter units (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180211/20180211010936_2654.jpgFigure 3. Results of analysis of subcellular localization of GFP fusion proteins in tobacco protoplasts isolated from the cells of an agroinfiltrated leaf area. Transient gene expression of plant expression vectors, with leader signal sequences providing their localization in various compartments of plant cells, demonstrates that GFP fusion protein is localized to the chloroplasts (I), endoplasmic reticulum (II), and cytoplasm (III). The merged images (first column) include the green channel (last column) and the chloroplast autofluorescence channel (middle column). Scale bars = 10 μm."
