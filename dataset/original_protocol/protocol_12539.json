  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: The plant material used in this study consisted of four C. sativa ARO-Volcani strains (CS-11, CS-12, CS-13, and CS-14) that were grown in the Volcani Center, Israel, as described elsewhere11. Glandular capitate stalked trichomes were isolated from mature flowering inflorescences, and glandular capitate sessile trichomes were isolated from large fan leaves from mature non-flowering mother plants. All plant material was freshly picked and immediately stored at −80 °C.\nCAUTION: Dry ice and LN are used throughout the protocol. These substances are extremely hazardous. The isolated trichomes can contain dry ice particles that can create dangerous gas pressure when inserted into sealed tubes; therefore, all caps should be needle-punctured. The use of protective goggles, appropriate lab wear, and gloves for handling at extremely low temperatures is highly advised.\n1. Setup for the initial separation of trichomes from the plant material\nCrush a dry ice block into small fine flakes using a hammer and a hard flat object in a 5 L plastic container.\nSieve the fine dry ice flakes (smaller than 5 mm) from the non-crushed dry ice with a large strainer (via pores smaller than 5 mm) into another 5 L plastic container. Pour approximately 200 cm3 (200 mL mark) of the dry ice flakes into an upright 1 L glass beaker.\nAdd up to 10 g of frozen C. sativa inflorescences (from now on referred to as plant material) onto the first layer of crushed dry ice, and cover with an additional layer of 200 cm3 of finely crushed dry ice.\nCover the opening of the 1 L glass beaker with two to three layers of 1 mm screen door mosquito net, and secure it to the outer sides of the glass cup with rubber bands (Figure 1).",
    "Pour LN into a large round-bottom stainless steel container (see Table of Materials), where the isolated trichomes will be collected.\nInsert a 350 µm mesh in a flour sifter/sieve strainer to cover the flour sifter mesh from below (Figure 2). If a flour sifter with a detachable plastic ring is available, insert the 350 µm mesh so that it is secured under the flour sifter's mesh. If not, secure the 350 µm mesh to the circumference of the flour sifter with rubber bands.\nPlace the flour sifter above the large round-bottom stainless steel container filled with LN (Figure 3). Ensure that the width of the container exceeds that of the flour sifter to minimize the loss of the sifted mass outside the round-bottom stainless steel container.\n2. Separation of trichomes from the plant material\nShake the 1 L glass with its opening pointing downward toward the flour sifter as if using a large salt shaker (Figure 4).\nSet aside the 1 L glass beaker every 2-3 min to allow the sifting of the crushed dry ice and plant material accumulated on the flour sieve.\nSift the flour sieve horizontally to facilitate the passage of the plant material into the LN in the round-bottom stainless steel container below.\nAdd LN to the stainless steel container and crushed dry ice to the 1 L glass beaker when their levels run low. Replenish the used plant material in the glass beaker with an additional 10 g of fresh plant material when the plant material on the flour sieve is depleted. The replenishment usually does not have to be repeated more than twice.",
    "Repeat steps 2.1-2.4 until a sufficient amount of enriched trichomes has been collected in the round-bottom stainless steel container. Generally, 20 g of fresh plant material is sufficient for RNA extraction and transcriptome analysis.\nVerify that there is a white powder-like substance (consisting of plant debris, glandular trichomes, and crushed dry ice) at the bottom of the stainless steel container submerged in the LN. A microscopic observation will help to determine if a sufficient amount of trichomes has been collected; however, this step might obstruct the protocol's flow. Usually, 10-20 g of initial plant material suffices for most isolations; however, there may be differences in the trichome density of the plants.\n\tNOTE: From this point, the experiment can be paused and restarted later. If paused for a short time, adequate amounts of LN should be added so that the trichomes remain submerged. Alternatively, the trichomes can be collected and stored at −80 °C for up to 3 months for later use, as described in step 5.\n3. Separation of glandular capitate trichomes (stalked and sessile) from other trichome types, such as bulbous and cystolithic trichomes, and debris\nAdd a small amount of LN to a clean small round-bottom stainless steel container.\nFold a 40 cm x 40 cm micro-sieve with a 150 µm mesh size twice to obtain a 20 cm x 20 cm fold, and open it. Ensure it resembles a cone-like shape (Figure 5).\nSecure the mesh cone to the edge of the round-bottom stainless steel container with one or two clothespins so that the opened part of the cone is upright and its pointed part is partly submerged in the LN.\nGently pour the LN and the white powder-like substance from step 2.6 into the micro-sieve cone.",
    "Gently apply a wide brush to gather and transfer any remaining plant material from the first container into the 150 µm mesh cone.\nAdd more LN to the first container, and repeat the brushing motion until all the plant material is transferred to the micro-sieve cone.\nCarefully detach the clothespin from the lid of the container, and open the micro-sieve cone so that the trichomes are located in the middle of the opened micro-sieve. Hold all four corners of the micro-sieve together so that the middle part containing the trichomes remains submerged in the LN (Figure 6).\nWhile holding all four corners of the micro-sieve, gently dip and shake the micro-sieve in the LN in the steel container as if infusing a tea bag. Continue this dipping/shaking (vertical and horizontal) motion for 1 min. There is a tradeoff between the isolation quality and quantity. Longer dipping motions may result in larger amounts of trichomes, but their isolation grade may be poorer. Overall, 1 min is recommended as adequate for both quality and quantity.\n\tNOTE: This sieving motion is the most critical part of the protocol and should be executed accordingly.\nOptional: Scoop the non-sifted plant debris and larger trichomes (still submerged in the LN) that are wrapped in the center of the micro-sieve into a 13 mL or 50 mL test tube, and store at −80 °C for future use.\n\t​CAUTION: To avoid the buildup of pressured gas (from the dry ice and LN residues), puncture a hole in the cap of the test tube with a sterilized needle. The cap can be replaced once the pressure has reduced, which is usually after 24 h.\n4. Passing trichomes through micro-sieves of decreasing pore size",
    "Transfer the sifted trichomes submerged in the LN at the bottom of the small round-bottom stainless steel container sequentially through micro-sieves with decreasing pore sizes (105 µm, 80 µm, 65 µm, and 50 µm), in the same manner as presented in step 3.\n5. Collection of the desired trichomes\nRemove the desired trichomes submerged in the LN and wrapped in the 50 µm micro-sieve using a pre-chilled (in LN) spoon. Place them on a clean plate.\n\tNOTE: In this final isolation stage, the desired trichomes are collected from the sieve.\nQuickly transfer the powder-like trichomes into a labeled pre-chilled 1.5 mL tube via a pre-chilled spatula or a scoopula inserted into the tube (Figure 7). Store the tubes immediately at −80 °C for further studies.\n\t​NOTE: A schematic workflow chart depicting the whole isolation protocol is given in Figure 8.\n6. Observation and analysis of the purified trichomes\nPlace a small amount (10 mg) of isolated trichomes on a microscope slide using a pre-cooled (via LN) spatula. Add a drop of water, and directly observe on a light microscope without staining. Evaluate the overall isolation and contamination degree using low (10x) and high (40x) magnifications. Enrichment is visually estimated by the relative amount of trichomes with respect to non-trichome tissue, as shown in Figure 9.\nPerform RNA extraction and quality analysis from 50 mg of isolated C. sativa glandular capitate stalked and sessile trichomes.\n\tNOTE: A commercial extraction kit (see Table of Materials) employing a poly-A-based strategy of mRNA purification was used for the RNA extraction.\n\t\nResuspend 50 mg of the isolated trichomes in the lysis solution, vortex for 30 s, sonicate in an ice-cold ultrasonic cleaning unit at 35 kHz for 5 min, and extract the mRNA from the samples according to the manufacturer's protocol (see Table of Materials).",
    "To estimate the integrity of the RNA extracted from the trichomes, determine the RNA concentration, the total amount, and the RNA integrity number (RIN) values using a lab-on-a-chip system (see Table of Materials).\nPerform RNAseq analysis of the trichome fractions (optional). RNAseq analysis and bioinformatics analyses of sequenced reads can be performed by standard outsourcing services\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
