    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe protocol involves six major steps which are repeated on each protein structure under consideration (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nStep 1: Determination of hetNOE values at two magnetic fields\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThis step illustrates the procedure for the determination of hetNOE values by measuring 15N{1H}-NOE experiment (Renner et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34]) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). This experiment incorporates through-space magnetization transfer via the dipolar coupling from the 1H to the directly attached 15N nucleus providing information regarding the motions of the individual N-H Bond vectors of the protein molecules. A considerable decrease in the NOE intensity value in comparison to the average NOE intensity is observed for the residues undergoing fast timescale motions (ps–ns timescale). The 15N{1H}-NOE experiment typically employs measurements of two different spectra with (termed as Saturated) and without (termed as Reference) proton saturation in an interleaved fashion. The ratio of the intensities in the Reference and Saturated spectra corresponds to the value of the steady-state heteronuclear NOEs for each residue.\nMeasurement on the NMR instrument with magnetic field strength B1 (for e.g., 11.7 Tesla (T) with a 1H-frequency of 500 MHz).\nData acquisition\nCreate a new dataset and experiment.\nLoad the Bruker pulse sequence for the 2D 15N{1H}-NOE experiment (e.g., hsqcnoef3gpsi from the standard Bruker pulse sequence library).\nAdjust the sample temperature on the NMR instrument to the desired value based on the stability of the sample and the quality of the spectrum.\nInsert the sample into the magnet.\nPerform steps for the lock, tune and match and shim.\nCalibrate the 1H pulse length (90° hard pulse) for the sample using a standard calibration experiment.\nCalibrate the water position to determine the 1H radio frequency carrier position.\nCalibrate the 15N pulse length (90° hard pulse) for the sample.",
    "Adjust the desired 15N radio frequency carrier length from the previous experiments (typically in the range of 116–122) and the sweep width of the spectrum to observe all resonances. If you have no idea from previous experiments, use 119 ppm as a carrier position and 36 ppm as a sweep width.\nOptional: Calibrate the 13C pulse length (90° hard pulse) for the sample if using an [U-13C,15N] labeled sample and adjust the desired 13C radio frequency carrier to 110 ppm. This approach ensures that the 15N is decoupled from neighboring Cα and CO resonances.\nAdjust the sweep widths for 1H and 15N and acquisition times.\nSet 2048 × 256 complex data points.\nSet the number of scans (ns) to the desired value, which is the compromise between obtained signal to noise and the availability of measurement time. In the example spectra, ns of 8 was used for 500 μM sample concentration. Increase the number of scans value, using the ns parameter for dilute samples accordingly.\nAdjust the recycling delay, d1, to at least 3s. It is important to have a longer d1 delay value to improve the accuracy of the measurement (Renner et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib34]).\nCheck the receiver gain by typing rga in the topspin command line.\nType zg to start the acquisition.\nCritical: Check the pulse sequence for the phase cycling value and determine the ns value accordingly to allow the selection of the proper coherence pathway. Typically, it is a multiple of 4, 8, or 16.\nData processing\nAfter the experiment is finished, type split in the Topspin command line to separate the interleaved Reference and Saturated spectra.",
    "Enter 2 as the rows to split and desired experiment number to store the new dataset, which will create two new separate datasets. The first will be the Reference and the second will be the Saturated experiment dataset.\nFirst process the Reference spectrum by using standard processing parameters, phase correction values and the 2D Fourier transformation command xfb.\nProcess the Saturated experiment using the same processing parameters as the reference spectrum. Most importantly the intensity scaling factor needs to be the same. To check the intensity scaling factor of the Reference spectrum, open the reference spectrum and type nc_proc. Note this value and open the Saturated experiment and type in the command line xfb nc_proc x, where x is the intensity scaling factor for the reference spectrum in an integer value.\nConvert Bruker files into the .ucsf file using the bruk2ucsf macro by NMRFAM-SPARKY.\nOpen .ucsf files for both Reference and Saturated spectra in NMRFAM-SPARKY. Transfer resonance assignments from the BMRB (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], 6.

Now you can see the additional column displaying data height for each peak.\nClick save to save the list for the reference spectrum.\nFor the noise estimation. Type st in the command line and note the value for the estimated noise.\nPerform the above-mentioned steps for the processing of the Saturated spectrum.\nData analysis using relaxGUI\nOpen relaxGUI. The detailed information regarding the use of relaxGUI can be found at (https://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/The_GUI.html[href=https://www.nmr-relax.com/manual/The_GUI.html]).",

    "Step 2: Determination of longitudinal relaxation rates (R1) at two magnetic fields\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nLongitudinal relaxation (T1), also called spin-lattice relaxation, is the relaxation process by which the net magnetization returns to the equilibrium as a function of time. Determination of T1 relaxation involves quantifying the recovery rate of net magnetization aligned with the applied magnetic field (B0) using time-dependent recovery of intensity (Kay et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). Longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), the simple inverse of the T1, is most-commonly determined by using the inversion recovery experiment (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). This experiment involves the application of 180° pulse to perturb the magnetization from z to -z-axis, followed by a variable delay (to allow magnetization to relax to z), and subsequent 90 ° pulse to flip the magnetization from z-axis to the xy plane for the detection.\nMeasurement of longitudinal (R1) relaxation on the NMR instrument with magnetic field strength B1\nData acquisition\nCreate a new dataset and experiment.\nLoad the Bruker pulse sequence for the R1 relaxation measurement (e.g., hsqct1etf3gpsi).\nPerform further steps as described in 1a. iii–xii.\nAdjust the relaxation delay (d7) to the desired relaxation delay for e.g., 0.4 s.\nType zg to start the acquisition.\nPerform the above-mentioned steps to record experiments with effective relaxation delays such as 0.6, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0 and 2.4 s.\nData processing\nAfter all the experiments are finished, process the first spectrum (delay 0.4 s) using standard processing parameters and the 2D Fourier transformation command xfb. Note that this spectrum will have peaks with negative intensity. Determine the phase correction values and process with the 2D Fourier transformation command xfb. Note the intensity scaling factor for this spectrum by typing nc_proc in the topspin command line.",
    "Process all the remaining spectra using the same processing parameters as the first spectrum. Type in the command line xfb nc_proc x, where x intensity scaling factor (integer value) for the first spectrum.\nBefore opening spectra in the NMRFAM-Sparky, convert all the Topspin processed Bruker files into the .ucsf files using the bruk2ucsf macro from the NMRFAM-Sparky.\nOpen NMRFAM-Sparky. Click on File, Open and load all the processed .ucsf spectra files with variable delays from the R1 relaxation experiment.\nTransfer resonance assignments from the BMRB (see before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin], 6.

Click Apply and Next.",
    "The next step is required for the error analysis. The Baseplane RMSD using the noise obtained from NMRFAM-Sparky for each spectrum took a very long time for the calculations as well as resulted in the program crash. To bypass this problem, set the Baseplane RMSD value of 10 for each spectrum and use a statistical bootstrapping scheme to determine the associated errors for the R1 relaxation rates (see following steps x and xi).\nIn the following step assign the relaxation time (in seconds) such as 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0 and 2.4 to the respective spectrum ID string and click Apply and Finish.\nSet Exponential curve model to the inversion recovery. It is the three-parameter fit model which employs the parameters such as    R x   , I0 and I∞ and the following equation\n   I  ( t )   =  I ∞  −  I 0  ∗  e  ( −  R x  ∗ t )    \n This equation takes into account that the magnetization proceeds from the negative value at -I0 to finally relax as a positive I∞ value.\nClick execute from the main relax window to start the R1 relaxation analysis.\nOnce the calculations are finished, open the specified results directory.

    "To employ a statistical bootstrapping scheme for determining the associated uncertainty, iterate above mentioned (i–viii) steps (at least) three times by alternatively omitting two peak lists (i.e., use five peak lists instead of seven peak lists) for determining the R1 relaxation rate.\nDetermine the standard deviation for the R1 relaxation rates from these four datasets (one original + three from bootstrapping) for each residue to calculate the associated uncertainty.\nMeasurement of longitudinal (R1) relaxation on the NMR instrument with magnetic field strength B2\nRepeat all the steps outlined under 3.\nAlternatives: An alternative to the inversion recovery method is the saturation recovery method, which allows quicker T1 measurement, though inversion recovery is generally preferred for better sensitivity and its robustness with respect to the radiofrequency inhomogeneity as well pulse imperfections. For high molecular weight proteins TROSY-based experiments (Zhu et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib43]), which offer better sensitivity than the related HSQC-based experiments, would be an ideal choice. We recommend the optimized pulse sequences from (Lakomek et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]) which are implemented in the Bruker pulse sequence library (trnoeetf3gpsi3d.3, trt1etf3gpsitc3d.3, trtretf3gpsitc3d.3).\nStep 3: Determination of transverse relaxation rates (R2) at two magnetic fields\nTiming: 1–2 weeks",
    "Transverse relaxation (T2), also called as spin-spin relaxation, is the relaxation process for the decay of excited net magnetization perpendicular to the applied magnetic field (B0) with respect to time (Kay et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). One of the most-commonly used procedures to determine the T2 is to measure transverse relaxation in the rotating frame i.e., T1ρ. Transverse relaxation rate in the rotating frame (R1ρ), the simple inverse of the T1ρ, is determined by measuring the decay of a signal influenced by the spin-lock conditions to generate a rotating magnetic field near to the xy plane perpendicular to the static magnetic field (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) (Massi et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]). In this experiment, spins are excited by the application of a 90° pulse followed by a variable spin-lock period (Δ). A series of experiments with varying spin-lock periods are recorded to quantify the R1ρ rate. The R1ρ rate is then used to derive the R2 relaxation rate.\nMeasurement of transverse (R1ρ) relaxation on the NMR instrument with magnetic field strength B1\nData acquisition\nCreate a new dataset and experiment.\nLoad the Bruker pulse sequence for the transverse (R1ρ) relaxation measurement (e.g., hsqctretf3gpsi).\nPerform further steps as described in 1a. iii–xii.\nAdjust the relaxation delay (d31) to the desired relaxation delay (e.g., 0 ms) to record the first dataset.\nStart acquisition by typing zg in the command line.\nPerform the above-mentioned steps to record experiments with effective relaxation delays such as 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, and 65 ms.\nData processing\nDetermine the phase correction values for the first spectrum (delay 0 ms) and process it using standard processing parameters and the 2D Fourier transformation command xfb.\nPerform further data processing steps same as R1 relaxation data processing (as described in 3b. ii–ix).\nData analysis using relax GUI",

In this model, the magnetization begins at I0 decaying towards zero. It employs parameters such as    R x    and I0 and uses the following equation\n   I  ( t )   =  I 0  ∗  e  ( −  R x  ∗t )    \nNext click Execute button from the main relax window to start the analysis.\nThe output file for the R1ρ relaxation rates will be stored as r2.700.out in the results directory. Import it into i.e., Microsoft Excel after changing file extension to .txt. Subsequently analyze and plot R1ρ relaxation rates with respect to the residue numbers. Determine the associated uncertainity using statistical bootstraping scheme (see 3c. x,xi).\nCalculate R2 relaxation rate for each residue from the R1ρ relaxation rate using the following equation\n   R  1 ρ   =  R 1    cos 2  θ +  R 2    sin 2  θ,  \nwhere   θ =  tan  − 1    (  ν 1  / Δν )    and   Δν   is the offset of the rf field to the resonance (Massi et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib30]).\nDetermine the average R1ρ and R2 relaxation rates by taking the median and standard deviation for the values obtained for all the residues.",
    "Perform error propagation to determine the errors for R2 relaxation rates by using R1 and R1ρ rates and associated errors.\nMeasurement of transverse (R1ρ) relaxation on the NMR instrument with magnetic field strength B2\nRepeat all the steps outlined under 5.\nAlternatives: An alternative to the T1ρ measurements is the direct measurement of T2 involving magnetization decay. However, T2 measurements are often complicated by the phase inhomogeneity and hence, generally considered unreliable. T1ρ measurements are more suitable for determining R2 relaxation rates in the low-microsecond timescale. A very good alternative to determine R2 relaxation rates higher than this time window, is to employ TRACT (TROSY for rotational correlation times)-based approach (Lee et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]).\nStep 4: Validation using theoretical (HYDRONMR computed) relaxation rates\nThis step is performed to crosscheck the experimentally determined 15N relaxation rates against the theoretically predicted relaxation rates using HYDRONMR program (Garcia de la Torre et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Refer to the program manual for the complete description of the program and example files: http://leonardo.inf.um.es/macromol/programs/hydronmr/hydronmr.htm[href=http://leonardo.inf.um.es/macromol/programs/hydronmr/hydronmr.htm]\nTiming: 1–2 h\nHYDRONMR Calculation\nCreate a directory for the HYDRONMR calculation and copy the protein pdb file in the directory.\nCreate an HYDRONMR input file hydronmr.dat.\nPrepare an input file hydronmr.dat file by providing information about parameters such as the name of the molecule, name for the output file, name of the input PDB file, AER value (3.3 Å), which is the average value of the atomic element radius for most proteins which ranges in between 2.8 – 3.3 Å (Bernado et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]), temperature (298 K), Magnetic fields (16.4, 18.8 T etc.) and interatomic distance for the N-H bond (1.02 Å), Chemical shift anisotropy (−173 ppm etc.).\nThe values for NSIG, SIGMIN and SIGMAX, ETA, IFLAG, Gyromagnetic ratio, no. of values of the magnetic field can be left unaltered.",

Longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) 15N relaxation times derived from the experimentally derived relaxation rates such as (T1 = 1/R1) and (T2 = 1/R2) are used to determine the rotational correlation time (τc) (Kay et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]; Rossi et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35]) by using the following empirical equation:\n   τ c  ≈  1  4 π  ν N      6   T 1   T 2   − 7    \nwhere νN is the resonance frequency of 15N in Hz.\nThe rotational diffusion tensor is determined using TENSOR2 (Dosset et al., 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]) program which uses the experimentally determined backbone relaxation data and protein three-dimensional structural coordinates as an input.
