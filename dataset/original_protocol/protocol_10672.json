    "1. Crayfish Selection\nIn order to successfully apply the current approach to crayfish, select the respective adult specimens with sufficient carapace sizes (which is a carapace length of at least 30 mm) for sensor attachment, visually examine it for the absence of diseases, and check whether it lifts both chelae when it is touched. The above-mentioned parameters indicate an eligible state of crayfish health.\nNOTE: If several crayfish are expected to be used in the trial and are exposed to the same conditions, the experimental group should be formed based on several parameters: (i) similar weight and length; (ii) comparable heart rate; (iii) pronounced nocturnal activity; (iv) regular food consumption; (v) inter-molting period17. Sometimes, it is hard to define whether a crayfish is near to molting by the heart rate measurements or visual or tactile examinations only; therefore, the analyses of the crayfish's hemolymph total protein content can be helpful. Protein content is expected to be higher when the crayfish is closer to molting than in the inter-molting state18.\n2. Recording of Crayfish Cardiac Activity and Behavior\nIn order to noninvasively measure crayfish heart rates, preliminarily prepare the sensor for this procedure. Before this, put a crayfish into the tank with water and let it acclimate there for a few days as the preparation of the sensor19 will also take a few days.\nAxially couple an IR light-emitting diode (LED) with a phototransistor. Attach the optical sensor circuit onto a board; it will require a power supply of 5 V. For the LED connection, place a 200 Ω resistor on the IR sensor board; in order to connect the phototransistor, place a 220 Ω resistor on the board.",
    "When attached to the crayfish, the sensor output is modulated by the amount of hemolymph filling the crayfish cardiac muscle and scatters an incident light from the LED. In order to avoid reciprocal interference of the illuminated IR light by the LED and the reflected IR light from the crayfish heart, which is received by the phototransistor, place a small wall (0.5 x 1.5 x 4 mm, thickness x height x width) made of black antistatic plastic between the LED and the phototransistor.\nPlace the LED in a waterproof package, and cover the surface of the sensor with the waterproof dielectric gel from the side adjacent to the carapace for the protection of the electronic components from potential damage (Figure 1). Let the gel dry for 3 days in order to gain its best protective properties.\nFor an analog signal, attach thin flexible cables (about 3 m long) to the sensor and connect to the analogue-to-digital converter (ADC); from this, a digitized signal will be transferred to a personal computer over a USB interface, at which point the information about the crayfish cardiac activity is saved, analyzed in real-time with special software (see Table of Materials), and stored for further detailed analyses.\nAs soon as the sensor is prepared, attach it to the crayfish. In order to do this, switch the computer on and run the software. Determine the number of crayfish to be fixed to the sensors and recorded heart rate to be saved to the date file.\nRemove the crayfish from the water and wipe its dorsal carapace side with a paper towel. Wrap the chelae and abdomen of the crayfish in the paper towel in order to avoid any damages by human hand and to eliminate additional stress on the crayfish caused by warm human hands.",
    "NOTE: Do not use a previous cooling of the crayfish on ice or in the freezer for its immobilization before manipulations with the sensor attachment. The difference in temperatures leads to crayfish dorsal surface weeping which, in turn, leads to unreliable sensor fastening and quick adhesive detachment from the crayfish's carapace.\nPrepare a surface (i.e., take a small flat piece of plastic or tear a piece of sticky tape and fix it to a table) and a stick for mixing the glue. Press out two small drops (of a diameter of about 0.5 cm) from tubes A and B containing epoxy glue and quickly mix them.\nAttach the sensor to the crayfish dorsal carapace and try to find the place in which the cardiac signal amplitude would be maximal. Hold the crayfish with the sensor in one hand and, using the other free hand, put a drop of mixed glue on each of the four auxiliary wires located on the sensor (fix them in between steps 2.1.1 and 2.1.4.). Do not move the sensor at least 5 min until the glue hardens (the glue hardening depends on the ambient temperature and humidity).\nNOTE: When fixing the sensor to the crayfish carapace, examine thoroughly the whole cardiac area from the carapace side in order to define the area with the best (maximal) cardiac signal amplitude. That will help the software to provide more precise heart rate calculations.\nTouch the glue using a free hand, and if it is not sticky, put the unwrapped crayfish with the attached sensor (Figure 2) to the box without water for few more minutes until the glue is completely dry.",
    "NOTE: An optimal temperature for crayfish and glue manipulation varies from 18 to 22 °C. At these temperatures, the glue hardens within 5 to 7 min and is completely dry within 8 to 10 min. At lower temperatures, the stress in the crayfish is less pronounced; however, the glue needs more time to harden, about 15 and 20 min under 15 °C and 10 °C, respectively. At higher temperatures, particularly above 25 °C, the glue hardens within 3 min, but the crayfish undergoes much more stress; therefore, try to minimize the exposure of the crustacean to extreme conditions without water.\nBefore moving the crayfish back into the tank, dip its cephalothorax into the water several times with short intervals of a few seconds in order to allow a discharge of the air that has accumulated in the gills, and leave the crayfish in the water for approximately 1 h to remove any excess chemicals. After this process is complete, release the crayfish into the water and allow it to acclimate for one to two weeks under experimental conditions, depending on observed physiological indices. Optimal water exchange during the acclimation periods is every other day.\nNOTE: Characteristics of crayfish that have acclimated and are in a healthy state include pronounced circadian cardiac and locomotor activities, regular food consumption, and spending most daylight in a specialized shelter (if provided).\n3. Camera and Software Setup\nStart the software; the video camera will automatically switch on.\nSelect an option of movement detection, thoroughly detect area of each tank on the screen and the software will start tracking the behavior and linking it with the cardiac activity recordings.",
    "NOTE: A crayfish motion detection module consists of a video camera that tracks crayfish behavior from below the tank and the software that combines the behavior with cardiac activity. The data from the module are used to facilitate more precise cardiac activity data processing by eliminating periods in which the crayfish demonstrates high locomotive activity. Sudden crayfish movements (i.e., an escape reaction or feeding initiation) can result in fluctuations or short-time spikes in cardiac signals that may reduce the precision of cardiac interval calculations.\nSubscription Required.
