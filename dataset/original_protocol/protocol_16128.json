    "Separation of intact protein-metabolite complexes requires an extraction procedure that does not interfere with their integrity. Here, we describe a protocol for extracting native, soluble protein-metabolite complexes from frozen plant material. Following mechanical grinding and addition of a lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors, the extract is subsequently centrifuged to pellet cellular debris, membranes, and larger aggregates.\nMaterials\nFrozen plant material: to obtain sufficient protein amounts (40 mg) for size separation, 5 g of Arabidopsis rosette leaves or 3 g of Arabidopsis cell culture should be used.\nLysis buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20101#cppb20101-rec-0006])\nRetsch mill (Retsch, cat. no. 207450001)\nStainless steel grinding balls (Retsch, cat. no. 05.368.0034)\nCentrifuge tube, 50-ml (Sarstedt, cat. no. 62.559)\nVortex Shaker Genie® 2 2 Shaker (Scientific industries, cat. no.

Homogenize frozen plant material using a Retsch mill and 5-mm stainless steel grinding balls at 30 Hz for 1 min. Repeat this step four times in total. Place sample in liquid nitrogen between grinding steps.\n2. Weigh 3 g (for Arabidopsis cell culture) of frozen plant material into a 50-ml tube.\nBe careful not to thaw plant material while aliquotting.\n3. Add 3 ml of lysis buffer and vortex vigorously until the material thaws.\nKeep your samples on ice during the entire procedure.\nIf the plant material is clumpy after vortexing, use a precooled (4°C) mortar and pestle to homogenize the lysate before continuing.\n4. Centrifuge total lysate 10 min at 4000 × g, 4°C.",
    "5. Transfer the supernatant to 5-ml ultracentrifuge tubes and fill up the tube to the 5-ml mark with cold lysis buffer.\n6. Ultracentrifuge for 1 hr at 165,052 × g (max.), 125,812 × g (avg.) at 4°C. Set acceleration and brake speed to maximum.\n7. Transfer the supernatant (soluble fraction) to an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter unit and centrifuge 10 min at 4000 × g, 4°C, or until a volume of 2.5 ml is obtained.\n8.

Adjust the protein concentration using cold lysis buffer to reach a final concentration of 40 mg in 2 ml.",
    "Quantitation of proteins is a critical point in protein studies. In PROMIS, the Bradford assay is used to determine the protein concentration of soluble total extracts for SEC as well as to determine the protein concentration needed for protein trypsin digestion (Bradford, 1976[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20101#cppb20101-bib-0002]).\nMaterials\nBradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.

Pre-incubate Bradford reagent at room temperature.\n2. Prepare a BSA standard in the range of 0.1 to 2 mg/ml in water.\n3. Dilute the samples to 1:50 and 1:100 in water.\n4. Prepare standard curve.\n5. Add 200 µl of Bradford reagent to 5 µl of diluted sample, and measure absorbance at 595 nm.",
    "Here, we describe a workflow for separating native protein–small molecule complexes in cell lysates into fractions based on the sizes of the complexes, using SEC. As the sample passes through the column, smaller molecules enter the pores, which slow them down, while larger ones cannot enter any pores, thus passing through the column faster. Therefore, macromolecular complexes elute first, followed by unbound small molecules.\nMaterials\nSeparation buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20101#cppb20101-rec-0008])\nCell lysate\n2-ml screw-cap tubes\nÄKTA Explorer 10 (GE Healthcare Life Science, cat. no. 18130000)\nSEC column (SRT SEC-300 21.2 × 300 mm; Sepax, cat. no. 225300-21230)\nLyophilizer, Alpha 2-4 (Christ, cat. no.

For separation, set the flow rate of the ÄKTA Explorer chromatography apparatus to 7 ml/min, load 2 ml of cell lysate corresponding to 40 mg of protein by injecting the sample using a syringe, and clean the needle.\n4. Collect 60 1-ml fractions from 61 ml to 121 ml elution volume in the previously prepared, open screw-cap tubes.\n5. Close the tubes, place them in a cardboard rack inside a styrofoam box, and then snap-freeze the samples by gently pouring liquid nitrogen into the box.\n6. Store samples at −80°C or lyophilize and store in a dry place at room temperature until further use.",
    "In the PROMIS experiment, we use a single-step extraction protocol for comprehensive and simultaneous analysis of lipids, polar metabolites, and proteins from a single fraction utilizing a complex extraction buffer containing solvents with different polarities (Giavalisco et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20101#cppb20101-bib-0011]). Three independent fractions are separated: organic upper phase containing non-polar metabolites, such as lipids; lower polar phase containing polar primary and secondary metabolites; and protein/starch pellet. The obtained fractions are further analyzed using LC-MS.\nMaterials\nExtraction buffer 1 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20101#cppb20101-rec-0002])\nExtraction buffer 2 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20101#cppb20101-rec-0003])\nLyophilized sample (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20101#cppb20101-prot-0003])\n1.5- and 2-ml tubes (Eppendorf, cat. no. 0030120086 and 0030120094)\nUltrasonication bath (Bandelin, cat. no.

Add 1 ml of pre-cooled (−20°C) extraction buffer 1 to the lyophilized sample and vortex vigorously.\n2. Incubate 10 min at 4°C with shaking, then sonicate for 10 min by partially submerging the tubes in a sonication bath filled with water to ensure metabolite extraction from dry pellet.\n3. Add 0.5 ml of extraction buffer 2 and mix well by vortexing.\n4. Centrifuge samples 5 min at 20,817 × g, room temperature, in a benchtop centrifuge.\nYou should obtain two separated liquid phases, and a protein pellet on the bottom of the tube.\nOptional: Transfer 700 µl of the upper (organic) phase to a fresh 1.5-ml tube and dry in a centrifugal evaporator. Now you can continue with lipid analysis (Giavalisco et al., 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20101#cppb20101-bib-0011]), or if not needed, discard the lipids fraction.\n5. Remove the rest of the organic phase together with the interphase using a vacuum aspirator.\n6. Transfer 500 µl of the lower (polar) phase to a fresh 1.5-ml tube and dry using a centrifugal evaporator. Continue with the polar metabolites analysis (Basic Protocol 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20101#cppb20101-prot-0005]).",
    "7. Remove remaining polar phase and air-dry the protein pellet. Freeze the pellets at −80°C or continue with digestion of proteins.",
    "This protocol describes how metabolites are separated and quantified using reversed-phase HPLC and mass spectrometry, respectively. In addition, the protocol describes the conversion of acquired spectra and chromatograms to a matrix consisting of mass features, which are characterized by a unique mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), retention time (RT), and intensity. Quantified mass features are then assigned to actual metabolites by querying their m/z and RT against a library of commercially available standards. Here, a combination of SEC and HPLC-MS enables metabolome-wide identification of any metabolites remaining in the complexes with proteins.\nMaterials\nSample: aqueous phase from Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20101#cppb20101-prot-0004]\nLC-MS mobile phase buffer A (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20101#cppb20101-rec-0004])\nLC-MS mobile phase buffer B (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20101#cppb20101-rec-0005])\nUltrasonication bath (Bandelin, cat. no.

    "Data integration is a crucial step in searching for captured co-eluting protein–metabolite pairs. The workflow described in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20101#cppb20101-fig-0002] can be performed using any table-calculating software, such as Microsoft Excel. However, it only represents the minimal requirements to match the obtained proteomics and metabolomics data. Additional steps can be included in the data analysis pipeline, such as data noise filtering, data smoothing, and peak deconvolution, and we highly recommend this (Gorka et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cppb.20101#cppb20101-bib-0048]). Since data integration of large data sets can be time consuming, script-based tools for the automated analysis of such data sets might be expected considering the growing number of PROMIS users.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/689049bf-1817-4ab4-8def-14f8444a60e5/cppb20101-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nScheme of data integration workflow. Protein and metabolite data are obtained from MaxQuant and Refiner MS, respectively. Individual replicates of the same compound or protein are checked for reproducibility by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) (A). If the PCC exceeds a chosen threshold, the replicates are combined to a summed profile. This profile is normalized to its maximum intensity (B). Finally, metabolite and protein data are integrated by checking whether the PCC of a protein and metabolite pair exceeds a given threshold. A high PCC indicates co-elution of a protein–metabolite pair (C).\nFor data integration, data from different experimental replicates are combined. To do this, the elution profiles of replicates with high reproducibility, expressed as the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), are summed to one profile. Next, the resulting profile is normalized to its maximum intensity. Finally, the PCC between metabolite and protein profiles is calculated. A high PCC indicates co-eluting metabolite–protein pairs."
