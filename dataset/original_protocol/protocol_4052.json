    "Preparation of M15 cells   M15 cells (5x106) are plated to a 100 mm dish with 10 ml EF medium.   M15 cells are incubated in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.   When M15 cells are confluent (for 2-3 days), passage from a 100 mm dish to five 100 mm dishes.   M15 cells are washed by PBS.   M15 cells are trypsinized with 1 ml 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min.   M15 cells are pelleted at 190 x g for 5 min.   M15 cells are plated to five 100 mm dishes.      When M15 cells are confluent, M15 cells are incubated with 10 μg/ml MMC containing EF medium in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2 h. M15 cells are treated with MMC to stop M15 cell from proliferation.   MMC-treated M15 cells are washed by PBS.   MMC-treated M15 cells are trypsinized with 1 ml 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min.    M15 cells are pelleted at 190 x g for 5 min.   Resuspend and freeze MMC-treated M15 cells into cryovials in 22% FBS and 20% DMSO containing DMEM at 1 x 107 cells per tube at -150 °C.      Preparation of MEF   MEF (5x106) are plated to a 100 mm dish with 10 ml EF medium.   MEF are incubated in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.   When MEF are confluent (for 2-3 days), passage from a 100 mm dish to five 100 mm dishes.   MEF are washed by PBS.   MEF are trypsinized with 1 ml 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min.   MEF are pelleted at 190 x g for 5 min.   MEF cells are plated to five 100 mm dishes.      When MEF cells are confluent, MEF are incubated with 10 μg/ml MMC containing EF medium in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 2 h.",

Maintenance of mouse ESCs   2 x 106 MMC-treated MEF cells are plated to a gelatin-precoated 60 mm dish with EF medium.    MMC-treated MEF cells are incubated in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C overnight.   Mouse ESCs (5x105) are plated on MEF-coated dish with Maintenance Medium, and are incubated in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C (day 0) until passage (3 days).    Medium is changed every day.        Intestinal differentiation of mouse ESCs   1 x 107 MMC-treated M15 cells are plated to two gelatin-coated 6 well plates and are incubated in the 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C overnight.   ESCs plated on MEF-coated dishes (step B3) are washed by PBS.   ESCs are trypsinized with 1 ml 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA at 37 °C for 5 min.   ESC cells are pelleted at 190 x g for 5 min.   The supernatant is removed and 1 x 106 cells/ml resuspended in the EB Medium.    2 x 104 ESCs in 2 ml EB medium are plated to a M15-pre-coated well (day 0).   Medium is changed to Endoderm Medium at day 1 and 3.   Medium is changed to the Intestinal Medium at day 5.   Medium is changed with 2 ml Intestinal Medium at day 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17 and 19 (Figure 1).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131219/20131219200445_5349.jpg Figure 1.
