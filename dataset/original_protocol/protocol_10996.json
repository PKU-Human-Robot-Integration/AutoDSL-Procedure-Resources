    "All samples used in the present protocol came from a study approved by the local ethics committees and authorized by the competent authority. All the participants in the study provided written informed consent. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03608046).\n1. Multiplex immunofluorescence\nFFPE sectioning\n\t\nFix the tissue in 4% paraformaldehyde, and embed the fixed tissue in paraffin.\nCut 5 µm sections, and place them on adhesive microscope slides.\nDry the slides overnight at room temperature (RT).\nDeparaffinization and endogenous peroxidases inhibition\n\t\nDewax the tissues by submerging the slides in toluene (3x for 5 min each) and methanol (3x for 5 min each) under a fume hood.\nInhibit the endogenous peroxidases by submerging the slides in 3% hydrogen peroxide diluted in methanol for 20 min under a fume hood.\nRinse the slides in distilled (d) H2O (1x for 3 min).\nMultiplex immunofluorescence staining\n\t\nSubmerge the slides in a 300 mL staining jar containing 10 mM citrate (pH 6) or EDTA (pH 9) buffer complemented with 0.1% TritonX-100.\n\t\tNOTE: The buffer used (pH 6 or pH 9) depends on the antigen stained (see Table 1).\nPlace the staining jar with the lid closed in a microwave for 3-5 min at maximum power (e.g., 900 W) until the buffer starts to boil.\n\t\tNOTE: The optimal time for boiling depends on the microwave and the volume of the buffer. Adjustments may be necessary to find the perfect timing. For some fragile antigens or fragile and less adherent specimens (e.g., organoids and spheroids), microwave boiling can be too harsh. In this case, a pressure cooker can be used instead.\nKeep the buffer at near-boiling temperature by putting the closed staining jar in the microwave on low power (e.g., 90 W) for 15 min.",
    "Perform the last step of heating by putting the microwave at maximum power for 90 s.\nRemove the jar from the microwave, and let the buffer cool down for 15 min at RT.\nRinse the slides 3x for 5 min each in dH2O and 1x for 5 min in tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T).\nRemove the TBS-T by blotting the slides on a paper towel\nPlace the slides (flat) on a staining chamber tray or microscope slide box (see Table of Materials).\nEncircle the tissue with a hydrophobic pen.\nBlock the non-specific binding sites by covering the tissue with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) dissolved in TBS-T for 30 min.\nRemove the blocking buffer by blotting the slides on a paper towel.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not rinse the slides after the blocking step.\nIncubate the tissue for 60 min with the primary antibody (see Table 1) diluted in 1% BSA TBS-T by covering the tissue with around 300 µL of the solution.\nRinse the slides 3x for 3 min each with TBS-T.\nIncubate the tissue for 40 min with poly-HRP secondary antibody (see Table 1) by covering the tissue with around 300 µL of the solution.\nRinse the slides 3x for 3 min with TBS-T.\nIncubate the tissue for 10 min with fluorochrome-tyramide reagent (see Table 1) diluted 200-fold in borate buffer (0.1 M borate, pH 7.8, 3 M NaCl) extemporaneously supplemented with 0.003% H2O2 by covering the tissue with around 300 µL of the solution.\nRinse the slides 3x for 3 min with TBS-T.\nRepeat steps 1.3.1-1.3.16 until all the TSA staining has been performed.\nIncubate the tissue overnight at 4 °C with the last primary antibody (see Table 1) diluted in 1% BSA TBS-T.",
    "NOTE: Since the incubation is overnight, it is important to cover the staining chamber tray or the microscope slide box and to add dH2O on a paper towel in the bottom of the box (under the slides) to make sure that the tissues do not dry during the incubation.\nRinse the tissue 3x for 5 min each with TBS-T.\nIncubate the tissue for 120 min with the secondary antibody (directly coupled with fluorochrome) diluted 200-fold in 1% BSA TBS-T.\nRinse the tissue 3x for 5 min each with TBS-T.\nStain the nuclei by incubating the tissue for 5 min in bisbenzimide (20 mM) diluted 1,000-fold in 10% BSA TBS-T.\n\t\t​NOTE: Bisbenzimide can be replaced by DAPI, but the latter is more toxic and has to be handled carefully under a fume hood.\nRinse the tissue 3x for 3 min each in dH2O.\nMount the slides by using a fluorescence mounting medium and borosilicate cover glasses.\n2. Slide scanning\nDigitalize the slides by scanning them on a fluorescence slide scanner at 20x magnification (slide scanner details are provided in the Table of Materials).\n\t​NOTE: A representative scan of an optimal multiplex is shown in Figure 1.\n3. Image analysis\nImport the scans into an image analysis software (File > Open Image).\nGo to the Classifiers tab, and select the DenseNet AI V2 plugin.\nTrain the DenseNet AI V2 plugin to recognize nuclei by surrounding around 500 nuclei in one image.\nTrain the AI on several other slides from the same batch and different batches of mIF staining by surrounding several nuclei (50) on several slides (around 10).",
    "NOTE: Detailed instructions on how to use the AI plugin can be found in the software manual. Using AI for nuclei detection is optional. Other methods to detect nuclei are available depending on the image analysis software used.\nSave the trained AI (Classifier Actions > Save).\nGo to the Annotations tab, and create an annotation for each region of interest (ROI), such as the center of the tumor and the margin of the tumor, by using the Pen Annotation Tool.\nIf necessary, remove the regions with folds and the regions that appear blurry with the Exclusion Annotation Tool.\n\tNOTE: Hematoxylin-eosin staining of a section adjacent to the one used for mIF can be performed before the mIF staining to ensure that tumor cells are present in the specimen and to help anatomopathologists to determine the ROIs.\nGo to the Analysis tab, and select the HighPlex FL algorithm (Settings Actions > Load > HighPlex FL).\nSelect the Dye Selection tab, and select the dye of interest.\nIn the Nuclear Detection tab, go to Nuclear Segmentation Type, and select AI custom.\nIn Nuclear Segmentation Classifier, select the AI saved at step 3.5.\nIn the Membrane and Cytoplasm Detection tab, chose the maximum cytoplasm radius (in this study, 1.5 was used) and the number of membrane dyes.\nFor each dye, select the nucleus positive threshold, the cytoplasm positive threshold, and the membrane positive threshold.\n\tNOTE: The threshold is different for each staining and should be adjusted for each batch of slides and each antigen stained. Using the View Settings tool (View > View Settings) can help to select an adequate threshold by using the intensity value at the end of the intensity peak (on the right).\nFor each dye, select the nucleus, membrane, and cytoplasm percentage of completeness values.",
    "NOTE: This parameter is important to avoid false positive detection when two cells with different staining are close to each other (Figure 2).\nSave the algorithm (Settings Actions > Save).\nAnalyze the ROIs (Analyze > Annotation Layer).\nGo to the Results tab, and select all the data in Object Data (ctrl + A).\nExport the data in .csv format (Right click > Export > Object Data .Csv).\n\t​NOTE: This table contains the position (Xmin, Xmax; Ymin, Ymax) and the positivity of each marker of each analyzed cell.\n4. Bioinformatics using R\nNOTE: An R script providing more details about the following steps is available on GitHub (benidovskaya/Ring: Pipeline for the analysis of multiplex immunofluorescence stainings. [github.com])\nUsing the exported table, first define the different cell types based on the colocalization stainings. For example, define cytotoxic T cells by double-positive CD3+/CD8+ cells.\nThen, reconstruct a simplified image of the slide on a dot plot using the coordinates exported from the image analysis software and ggplot2 (Figure 3). Using these data, several types of analysis can be performed:\n\t\nDensity analysis\n\t\tNOTE: The simplest analysis is a density analysis.\n\t\t\nPerform a density analysis for all the cell types using the entire slide for biopsies or some specific area of the tissue. For example, compute the density of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells at the center of the tumor and the margin of the tumor (Figure 4A-C).\nTo compute those densities, use image analysis software to produce a specific data frame per sample with the phenotype and coordinates of each cell. Through a clustering function (k-nearest neighbor) on R, create a polygon object using the borders of the studied biopsy, and calculate the density of the cell types of interest inside of it.",
    "NOTE: This allows for comparing the densities of different cell types between different conditions (such as different time points, treatment types, tissue types, and response to the treatment) and localizations (center of the tumor, margin of the tumor, stroma fibrosis, and necrosis area) depending on the biological hypothesis. Due to the high proximity between cancer cells, peri-tumoral cells, and tumor-infiltrating cells, the image analysis software may detect double-positive cells as immune and cancer cells at the same time. In that case, one needs to bioinformatically correct this issue by mentioning what these double-positive cells are. In this case, CD3+CD8+cytokeratin+ cells were tagged as cytotoxic cells because the cytokeratin positivity was due to the tumor cells surrounding the infiltrating lymphocytes.\nHeatmaps\n\t\t\nUsing the density of each cell type from different panels and by applying a normalization (e.g., scaling centering), draw heatmaps (Figure 5) representing the cell abundance in the population of samples.\nUsing hierarchical unsupervised clustering based on cell density, cluster patients with similar TME compositions, and correlate these clusters with clinical parameters such as treatment response and survival.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Heatmaps and clusterization can be easily performed with the R ComplexHeatmap package9.\nSpatial cell distribution\n\t\t\nCompute bioinformatically the distances between the cells (e.g., immune and tumoral cells; Figure 6A, B) based on the cell coordinates provided by the image analysis. Use the median and mean distances between the cell types of interest to compare the cell proximity across all the samples of a cohort.\nSpatial descriptive functions\n\t\t\nUse the cross-type nearest neighbor G-cross function, available through the R spatstat package10, to determine the probability for a cell of interest, X (e.g., a tumor cell), meeting the nearest cell, Y (e.g., a T cell), within a certain radius around cell X.",
    "Calculate the area under the empirical curve to obtain a numerical value representing the tumor infiltration of CD3+ T cells around the tumor cells11 (Figure 6C). Use other spatial descriptive functions such as the F-function or J-function12.\nImmunoscore analysis\n\t\t\nCompute the Immunoscore (I), developed by the team of Galon7,8, by using the density of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in the center of the tumor and the invasive margin of the tumor.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The score ranges from I0 to I4. A low density of both CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in the center and the margin of the tumor is associated with a score of I0, while a high density of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells in both regions is associated with a score of I4. Recently, the prognostic impact of the Immunocore was validated in a study with samples from 2,681 stage I-III colon cancer patients from 14 centers in 13 countries7. However, to be computed, Immunoscore requires a surgically resected specimen containing both the center and margin of the tumor. For biopsies, which usually lack a margin, a biopsy-adapted Immunoscore has been recently developed13.\nTo compute the biopsy-adapted Immunoscore, convert the value of the CD3+ and CD8+ T cell density into a percentile, and then use the mean percentile of CD3+ and CD8+ T cells for scoring into one of three categories (i.e., low, intermediate, and high)13.\nHotspot analysis",
    "Use hotspot analysis, by using the quadratcount function (spatstat)10, to compare the densities of different cell types in the most infiltrated area of the tissue. For example, it is possible to compute an \"Immunoscore-like\" score using the value of the CD3 and CD8 T cell density of the most infiltrated squares of the tissue (Figure 7). Apply this method for the analysis of any cell type with a non-homogeneous distribution across the tissue."
