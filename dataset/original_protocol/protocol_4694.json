    "Conjugation assay using cell linesIncubate Jurkat T cells (2 x 105/sample) with 1 μM of CellTracker Green CMFDA and Raji B cells (2 x 105/sample) with 3 μM CellTracker Orange CMRA in 0.5-1 ml of complete RPMI1640 medium in 15 ml conical tubes for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.Note: Perform all steps in the dark to prevent bleaching of fluorescence. For washing, centrifuge the cells at 1,300 rpm for 3 min, discard the supernatant, and resuspend cell pellet using complete RPMI1640 medium. Repeat twice. After washing, resuspend the cells in 200 μl/sample of complete RPMI1640 medium.Treat CMRA-labelled Raji B cells in 200 μl/sample of complete RPMI1640 medium with 5 μg/ml SEE for 30 min at 37 °C.Notes: SEE and SEB (B.5) act as the superantigens. Prepare SEE and SEB stock solution of 1 mg/ml in sterile distilled water (SDW) and store in -80 °C.Control samples of conjugation assay are samples untreated with SEE, SEB (B), and OVA peptide (C).SEE and SEB act as a superantigen that cause non-specific activation of T cells resulting in polyclonal T cell activation and massive cytokine release. Although SEE and SEB can bind both TCR and MHC to induce T cell activation, binding sites are different. SEE is used for formation of conjugation between Jurkat T cell-Raji B cell because Jurkat T cells have the human TCR Vβ recognized by SEE, not SEB. SEE can also apply to form mouse T cell-B cell conjugates, but SEB is more widely used in mouse T cell activation. Mix and incubate equal cell number of CMFDA-T cells (2 x 105/200 μl/sample) and CMRA-B cells (2 x 105/200 μl/sample) in complete RPMI1640 medium in the polystyrene round-bottom tube for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.",

    "Analyze unstained control to set voltage and gates (FSC, SSC, fluorescence signals).Analyze single-color stained controls for compensation.After compensation, analyze dual-color stained samples.Notes: Read the fluorescence of 10,000-20,000 cells in all controls and samples for analysis. The percentage of green-orange events indicates the proportion of T cell-B cell conjugates (Figure 1). Conjugation assay using mouse T cells and B cellsIsolate splenocytes from the spleen from a C57BL/6 mouse.Cut out the spleen.Mash the spleen through the cell strainer into 50 ml conical tube using the plunger end of the 1 ml syringe.Wash the cell strainer with 5-6 ml mouse T cell medium and discard the strainer.Transfer the suspended cells into a 15 ml conical tube, and spin down cells at 1,800 rpm for 3 min.Discard supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 1 ml RBC (Red blood cell) lysis buffer to remove RBCs. After 1 min, add 5 ml mouse T cell media and discard any dead cell mass.Spin down at 1,800 rpm for 3 min, and discard supernatant. Resuspend pellet in T cell enrichment buffer provided by the manufacturer or B cell enrichment buffer (2% FBS in PBS).Isolate CD3+ T cells from splenocytes using Mouse CD3+ T cell enrichment column kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Isolate B cells from mouse splenocytes using Mouse B cell enrichment kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After isolation, resuspend cells in mouse T cell medium.Note: The yield of T cell and B cell enrichment are above 95%.Incubate CD3+ T cells with 1 μM of CellTracker Green CMFDA (2 x 105/sample) and B cells with 3 μM CellTracker Orange CMRA (2 x 105/sample) in 0.5-1 ml of mouse T cell medium at 37 °C in 15 ml conical tubes as described in step A1.",
    "For washing, centrifuge the cells at 1,800 rpm for 3 min, discard the supernatant, and resuspend cell pellet using mouse T cell medium. Repeat twice. After washing, resuspend the cells in 200 μl/sample of mouse T cell medium.Treat B cells with 5 μg/ml SEB in 200 μl/sample of mouse T cell medium for 30 min at 37 °C.Mix and incubate equal cell number in 200 μl/sample of mouse T cell medium of CMFDA-CD3+ T cells and CMRA-B cells in the polystyrene round-bottom tube for 30 min at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Analyze the T cell-B cell conjugates using dual-color flow cytometry as described in step A5.Conjugation assay using antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells and target cellsIsolate splenocytes from an OTI mouse as described in step B1, and resuspend splenocytes in mouse T cell medium.Note: CD8+ T cells purified from an OTI-transgenic TCR mice express Ova-specific TCR that can recognize OVA 257-264 peptide as an antigen.For differentiation to OVA-specific cytotoxic T cells, stimulate splenocytes (2 x 106 cells/well) with OVA 257-264 peptide in mouse T cell medium with 10 U/ml rhIL-2 in 12 well cell culture plates for 2-3 days. Add rhIL-2 to media daily.Note: Thaw frozen stock of rhIL-2 (kept at -80 °C) and dilute in mouse T cell medium. Diluted rhIL-2 can be stored at 4 °C for one month.Isolate OVA-specific cytotoxic T cells by MACS separation using CD8a (Ly-2) MicroBeads according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Incubate OVA-specific cytotoxic T cells with 1 μM of CellTracker Green CMFDA (2 x 105-1 x 106/sample) and EL4 cells (as target cells; 2 x 105/sample) with 3 μM CellTracker Orange CMRA at 37 °C in mouse T cell medium, wash, and resuspend in mouse T cell medium as described in steps B3-4.",
    "Note: The relevant ratio of cytotoxic T cells and EL4 cells is 1:1-5:1.Add 10 μg/ml OVA 257–264 peptide to EL4 cells in 200 μl/sample of mouse T cell medium for 30 min at 37 °C.Note: OVA peptide loaded on EL4 cells acts as the antigen recognized by OVA-specific cytotoxic T cells.Mix and incubate equal cell number in 200 μl/sample of mouse T cell medium of CMFDA-cytotoxic T cells and CMRA-EL4 cells in the polystyrene round-bottom tube for 30 min-1 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator.
