    "These studies were approved by the Research Ethics Board of Queen's University, Canada.\n1. Endothelial Cell Stimulation\nCollagen-coat a 6-well tissue culture plate.\n24 h in advance, coat a 6-well tissue culture plate at 37 °C with 1 mL of collagen buffer (50 µg/mL rat tail collagen type 1 with 0.02 M glacial acetic acid).\nWash the wells twice with 2 mL of Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS).\n\t\tNOTE: Plates can be wrapped in tin foil and stored in an airtight plastic bag at 4 °C.\nSeed the endothelial cells at a density of 1 x 106 cells per well in 2 mL of growth medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Incubate the cells for 24 h at 37 °C (5% CO2).\n\tNOTE: Here, blood outgrowth endothelial cells (BOECs) between passages 5 and 15 were used. BOECs were isolated from healthy volunteers with a wildtype VWF sequence using a method referenced in Starke et al.22 in a manner similar to one previously described by JoVE23.\nRemove the medium after 24 h and wash the cells with HBSS.\nAdd 1 mL of serum-free medium (minimal essential growth medium without FBS) containing phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 100 nM), unfractionated histone (UH), and HK or HR (all at 25 µg/mL) to the cells for 2 h at 37 °C (5% CO2).\n\tNOTE: This concentration of histone was based on previous in vitro cytotoxicity reports by Xu et al.24 and Abrams et al.25 that used 50 µg/mL.\nCollect the medium after 2 h and store it at -20 °C until analysis.\n2. VWF Quantification by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)\nCoat a microplate with 100 µL of coating buffer (10 mM dibasic sodium phosphate and 145 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.2) containing 10 µg/mL polyclonal anti-VWF antibody overnight at 4 °C.",
    "Wash the plate three times with 250 µL of wash buffer (10 mM dibasic sodium phosphate, 500 mM sodium chloride, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.2).\nDilute the medium samples 1:2 and 1:4 with wash buffer and use normal reference plasma for a standard curve, beginning at a 1:10 dilution.\nPlate 100 µL of diluted samples and standards overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the plate three times with 250 µL of wash buffer.\nAdd 100 µL of diluted anti-VWF, HRP-conjugated detection antibody (1.1 µg/µL in wash buffer) to the plate and incubate for 1 h at room temperature.\nWash the plate and incubate for 10 min with O-Phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (OPD) reagent, as per the manufacturer's instructions.\nStop the reaction with 100 µL of 1 M H2SO4 and read the plate at 492 nm.\n3. Solid-phase Histone-VWF Binding Assay\nCoat a microplate with histones diluted in 0.5% sodium deoxycholate 50 mM carbonate buffer (pH 9.6) to 10 µg/mL overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the plate three times with 250 µL of PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20, incubating for 10 min between washes.\nBlock the plate with 200 µL of PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature.\nRepeat step 3.2.\nSerially dilute plasma-derived human VWF/factor VIII complex from 200 mU/mL to 25 mU/mL in saline buffer (10 mM dibasic sodium phosphate, 500 mM sodium chloride, and 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.2). Add 100 µL to the plate for 2 h at room temperature.\nRepeat step 3.2.\nDetect the binding of VWF to immobilized histone using 100 µL of a solution containing PBS-0.1% Tween 20 and 1:1,000 rabbit polyclonal anti-VWF antibody conjugated to HRP for 1 h at room temperature.\nRepeat step 3.2.",
    "Incubate the plate for 30 min with 100 µL of OPD reagent and stop the reaction with 100 µL of 1 M H2SO4. Measure the optical density at 492 nm.\n4. Seeding Endothelial Cells onto Flow Chambers\nLoad 0.5 mL of collagen-coating buffer (described in step 2.1) into a Luer-lock 1-mL syringe.\nTwist the Luer-lock end of the syringe onto the reservoir of a flow chamber slide.\nPress the plunger slowly until the entire lane is coated and each reservoir is full. Repeat for each lane and incubate the chamber at 37 °C for 24 h.\nAspirate the collagen-coating buffer with a 200 μL pipette. Load another syringe with 1 mL HBSS and press the plunger slowly to wash each lane of the flow chamber. Aspirate the wash with a 200 μL pipette at the opposing end of the flow chamber. Repeat twice.\nPipette approximately 100 µL of a 3 x 106 cells/mL endothelial cell (BOEC) solution in growth medium with 10% FBS into the lane of a flow chamber.\n\tNOTE: The seeding density of endothelial cells exceeds the capacity of the chamber. This is to ensure maximal channel coverage; non-adherent cells are removed in the subsequent wash step.\nIncubate the chamber at 37 °C for 24 h. Change the medium every 8-12 h using Luer-lock syringes (as in step 4.4). Ensure that there are no visible bubbles in the lanes.\n5. Isolating Platelets from Human Whole Blood\nIn a biological safety cabinet with a 30 G needle, add 300 µL of acid-citrate dextrose buffer (85 mM trisodium citrate, 111 mM D-glucose, and 71 mM citric acid, pH 4.5) to an additive-free 3 mL blood collection vacutainer.",
    "Collect whole blood from healthy volunteers (free from anti-platelet and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for seven days) by venipuncture (three tubes of 3 mL each), following a protocol similar to that published by Bernardo et al26.\nDiscard the first tube, as the initial tissue damage associated with the venipuncture can cause spontaneous platelet activation.\nGently invert the vacutainers three times to mix the blood with anticoagulant.\nCentrifuge the vacutainers at 150 x g for 15 min at 24 °C (room temperature).\nSlowly remove the platelet-rich plasma (supernatant) with a pipette in a biological safety cabinet and carefully transfer it to a 15-mL conical tube. Transfer the platelet-rich volume of each vacutainer to a single conical tube to avoid potential cross-activation.\n\tNOTE: Platelet isolation should be performed in a biological safety cabinet to prevent bacterial contamination and potential artificial platelet and/or endothelial activation.\nCentrifuge the conical tubes at 900 x g for 10 min at 24 °C (room temperature) to pellet the platelets.\nPipette and discard the platelet-poor supernatant.\nWash the pellet carefully with 1 mL of citrate-glucose-sodium (CGS) buffer (13 mM sodium citrate, 30 mM D-glucose, and 120 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.0).\n\tNOTE: The platelets will appear in wisp-like formations when the CGS buffer is added and the pellet is gently resuspended. In samples contaminated by platelet activation, the platelets will not easily resuspend and will appear clumpy.\nOnce fully resuspended, centrifuge the samples at 900 x g for 10 min at 24 °C (room temperature).\nRemove the CGS wash buffer and resuspend the pellet in 3 mL of Tyrode's buffer (138 mM sodium chloride, 5.5 mM D-glucose, 12 mM sodium bicarbonate, 2.9 mM potassium chloride, and 0.36 mM dibasic sodium phosphate, pH 7.4). Ensure complete resuspension of the platelets and, if aggregations are observed, discard the sample.",
    "Add 1.5 µL from a 20 mM DiOC6 stock solution (dissolve 57.25 mg in 5 mL of methanol) to each 3 mL conical tube of washed platelets for a final concentration of 1 µM.\n\tNOTE: DIOC6 is a green fluorescent mitochondrial dye used in this experiment to label platelets.\nAliquot 1 mL of the washed platelet solution to three 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tubes.\n\tNOTE: The platelet volume required for this experiment is calculated based on the size of the flow chamber, the desired shear stress, and the length of the experiment (step 6.5). This protocol can be adjusted as conditions change to ensure that there is enough volume for fluid flow.\nUse the washed platelets within 2 h of isolation.\n6. Flow Apparatus Assembly\nAttach a 70 cm piece of sterile silicone tubing (interior diameter of 1.6 mm) to a male elbow Luer connecter at one end and a female Luer lock adaptor at the other.\nConnect the female Luer lock adaptor attached to the tubing to a 20 mL syringe.\nRepeat steps 6.1 and 6.2 twice to generate three identical syringe-tubing connections.\nUse a syringe pump to generate fluid flow. Input the following settings into the syringe pump: interior diameter of the syringe and flow rate.",
    "NOTE: A 20-mL syringe has an interior diameter of 19.55 mm. The flow rate is calculated based on the desired shear rate/shear stress and the dimensions of the flow chamber. For the flow chamber used in the current study, to achieve 1 dyn/cm2 (observed in low venous shear), a flow rate of 9.37 µL/min is required. Because of evidence linking histones to venous thrombosis, a moderate venous shear of 4.45 dyn/cm2 is selected. This is also based on the assumption that the buffer has a similar viscosity to water. The flow rate is then equal to 41.7 µL/min. Equations used to calculate the flow rate for various flow chamber dimensions can be found at:\n\t\nSet the pump to withdraw fluid using the button option on the syringe pump.\nLoad the three syringes attached to tubing on the syringe pump and tightly secure brackets around the syringes and plungers.\nAttach a male elbow Luer to both ends of a second 20 cm piece of sterile silicone tubing.\nConnect one elbow Luer to a blunted 18-gauge needle.\nRepeat twice, creating three identical intake systems for the three lanes of the flow chamber.\n\tNOTE: The silicon tubing and Luers can be washed with 10% bleach followed by distilled water before reuse. It is not recommended to reuse the flow chambers.\n7. Microscope Settings\nUse a spinning disk microscope equipped with a fully automated stage. Perform illumination with a laser launch that provides 405, 458, 491, 543, and 633 nm laser lines. Capture all images with a 20X objective. Adjust all parameters with the analysis software (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/_asset/file/metamorph-basic-commands.pdf).",
    "Select the channel settings (emission filter: 520/35), with excitation at 491 nm, for acquisition. Set the electron multiplying charge-coupled device to an electron-multiplying gain of 150, with an exposure time of 200 ms, to obtain the full dynamic data range.\n\tNOTE: Platelets are labelled with a green fluorescent dye, DiOC6, with wavelength maxima (excitation, 482 nm; emission, 504 nm).\nAdjust the 491 nm laser power to 20%.\nMark the centre of all three lanes and select 1 μm for z range and 0.5 μm for step size. Select the number of time points (i.e., duration) and the time between images (i.e., interval) to capture an image every 10 s; select \"60 time points\" per slide. Set the microscope to capture images from the three lanes and save them to a designated experiment folder.\n\tNOTE: Because the flow chamber has three lanes, the microscope will need to toggle between three positions to capture the images.\n8. VWF-platelet String Formation\nRemove the culture medium from the flow chamber (from step 4) using the same technique as in step 4.4.\nAdd 100 µL of either histamine (25 µM), PMA (100 nM), UH, HK, or HR (all at 25 µg/mL) diluted in serum-free medium (as in step 1.4) to stimulate the BOEC monolayer for 15 min at room temperature and ambient O2/CO2.\n\tNOTE: Although not necessary for VWF release, performing this stimulation at 37 °C will improve VWF exocytosis27.\nEnsure that one of the three separate lanes of the flow chamber remain untreated as an experimental control.\nRemove the medium using a 1 mL syringe and replace it with 100 - 200 µL of PBS to wash the secretagogues off of the endothelial monolayer.\nMount the flow chamber onto a slide stand using vascular clips to secure the chamber in place.",
    "Attach the available male Luer connector on the end of the 70 cm tubing (connected to the syringe) to the reservoir of the flow chamber. Repeat for the two other flow chamber lanes.\nStart the syringe pump to remove the PBS wash. Pipette additional PBS into the opposing flow chamber reservoir to ensure that the lanes do not run dry.\nObserve the flow system for equivalent flow across all three lanes and then pause the syringe pump.\nSelect an area to capture the images in about the middle of each lane, in roughly the same area between experiments.\n\tNOTE: The person operating the microscope can be blinded to the experimental conditions. This step ensures that the microscope is focused prior to platelet flow (refer to step 7).\nAttach a female luer coupler to a 5 mL syringe and then to the free male luer connector (step 6.8) and submerge the blunted needle in the 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing the washed platelet solution (step 5.13). Slowly draw the platelet solution through the tubing to ensure no air bubbles within the system.\nRemove the 5 mL syringe and attach the male Luer to the open reservoir of the flow chamber. Repeat for the three lanes.\nRestart the syringe pump and capture images during platelet flow using the microscope and protocol settings from step 7 for 10 min in the dark.\nAfter 10 min, disconnect the Luer from the intake tubing on the flow chamber reservoir and fill the reservoir with PBS to maintain flow over the endothelial monolayer.\n9. VWF-platelet String Quantification",
    "NOTE: The continuous flow of PBS is required to maintain the VWF-platelet string elongation for image analysis. Cessation of flow will result in the VWF becoming globular and will impair VWF-platelet string quantification. It is essential to top up each reservoir with PBS during image capture. HBSS can replace PBS if cell shrinking or detachment is observed during this step.\nBeginning with the first lane, capture 10 images per slide without overlap using a 20X objective lens around middle of the slide. Repeat this for each lane.\n\tNOTE: The areas surrounding the reservoirs should be avoided due to turbulent shear stress.\nUsing image processing software, adjust the brightness by clicking \"Image,\" \"Adjust,\" and \"Brightness/Contrast.\" Drag the scroll bar until the adhered platelets can be viewed well enough for quantification.\nRecord a VWF-platelet string when three or more aligned platelets are observed in the image. Count all the VWF-platelet strings in an image. Repeat for all 10 images and average for the experiment.\n\tNOTE: The person performing the quantification can be blinded to the experimental conditions. It is not necessary to co-stain for VWF, as this has been confirmed by independent studies8,28,29.\nRepeat the experiment a minimum of three times to evaluate each secretagogue.\nSubscription Required.
