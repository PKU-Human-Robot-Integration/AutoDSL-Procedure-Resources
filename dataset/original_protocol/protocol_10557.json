    "1. Preparation of Migration Chambers\nPrepare a paraffin wax/petroleum jelly (1:1) mix and heat until the mixture has melted. Using a paint-brush and draw 2-3 layers of the paraffin wax/petroleum jelly (1:1) mix in the middle of the glass slide in accordance to Figures 1B-1D.\n\tNOTE: We are using common glass slides (76 x 26 x 1.0-1.5 mm (W/D/H))\nApply the melted paraffin wax/petroleum jelly mix rapidly on the glass slide to avoid solidification while drawing. Ensure the paraffin wax/petroleum jelly layer is about 2-2.5 cm in length and 0.3-0.5 cm in width. The thickness of the paraffin wax/petroleum jelly layer should be about 0.1-0.15 cm.\nAdd a coverslip to the solidified paraffin wax/petroleum jelly mix and seal it with two to three layers paraffin wax/petroleum jelly mix (Figures 1E,1F). Use 4-8 migration chambers for a common cell migration experiment. Place migration chambers in an upright position in a rack.\n2. Preparation of the Collagen Suspension Cell Mix\nHarvest (e.g., with 0.25% Trypsin/EDTA) and count cells of interest. Resuspend the cells in complete media containing fetal calf serum (FCS), antibiotics and recommended supplements. Prepare 4-8 1.5 ml reaction tubes and 20 µl cell suspension containing 4-6 x 104 cells (the total number of cells depends on the cell type to be analyzed) and fill up to 50 µl with complete media.\n\tNOTE: Additional compounds (e.g., growth factors, chemokines, inhibitors, etc.) are added to the cell suspension. Use appropriate stock solutions such that the final volume of cell suspension does not exceed 50 µl.",
    "Prepare a total amount of 452 µl final collagen suspension for four cell migration experiments. Add 50 µl 10x MEM (pH 5.1-5.5) and 27 µl of 7.5% sodium bicarbonate solution (pH 9.0-9.5) to a 1.5 ml reaction tube and mix thoroughly. Observe the solution color turn from yellow-orange to intense purple (pH 9.0-9.5). Add 375 µl liquid collagen suspension to the 10x MEM/sodium bicarbonate solution and mix thoroughly. The pH of the final collagen suspension should be about 7.5 (indicated by a light purple color).\n\tNOTE: Check the pH of the 7.5% sodium bicarbonate solution. If the pH is about 7.5 place the sodium bicarbonate solution with an open lid in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) to be saturated with CO2 and increase the pH (about 9.0 - 9.5). The pH of collagen suspension cell mix is crucial for the stability of the collagen network. If it is too low the collagen lattice will collapse during the cell migration experiment.\n\tNOTE: For this protocol, use liquid collagen (pH 1.9-2.2) from bovine hind (2.9-3.3 mg/ml collagen; 95% collagen type I, 5% collagen type IV). Examples of further collagen lattice preparation protocols using collagen type I from other sources, such as porcine or rat, are given in 32,33. Do not change the volumes of the used solutions as this will alter the ultimate collagen concentration of 1.67 mg/ml of the lattice. A higher or lower collagen concentration has an impact on the density of collagen fibers and the average distance between them concomitant with the cells migratory behavior34.",
    "Add 100 µl of the final collagen suspension to 50 µl cell suspension and mix thoroughly.The final collagen suspension (1.67 mg/ml collagen) is slightly viscous. To transfer the correct amount (100 µl), pipette the final collagen solution once up and down before transferring it to the cell suspension.\n\tNOTE: Once the collagen suspension cell mix is combined with the 10x MEM/sodium bicarbonate solution and the pH value has changed to 7.5 the collagen fibers immediately start to polymerize.\nTransfer the final collagen suspension cell mix from the reaction tubes to the migration chambers. Gently tap the migration chamber to equally distribute the collagen suspension cell mix on the bottom of the migration chamber (Figure 1H). Place the migration chambers in an upright position in a rack and incubate for about 30 min (37 °C, 5% CO2) to allow polymerization of the collagen fibers.\nNotice that the polymerized collagen lattice is slightly turbid but still being light purple color. Fill up the migration chambers with complete medium or complete medium with supplements of interest and seal the migration chamber with paraffin wax/petroleum jelly mix (Figures 1I,1J).\n3. Recording and Analysis of Cell Migration\nThis section describes the recording of cell migration by time-lapse video microscopy and analysis of cell migration by manual cell tracking.\nSwitch on the microscope and the microscope stage heater. Adjust the temperature to 37 °C. Use a 10X objective. Place migration chamber under a microscope and focus approximately 50 cells or more in the field of view.\nRecord cell migration in time-lapse mode using a multi-camera video surveillance software application. Save cell migration movies in an appropriate format, e.g., “*.avi” or “*.mov”. Link the cell migration movie files to a database containing supporting information, such as cell type and experimental conditions.",
    "NOTE: We are recording lymphocytes and HSPCs for up to 2 hr using a time-lapse factor of 1:80, which means that 0.75 sec in time-lapse is equal to 1 min in real-time. Tumor cells are slow moving cells and are thus recorded for at least 16 hr using a time-lapse factor of 1:1,800 (0.5 sec in time-lapse is equal to 15 min in real-time).\nAnalyze cell migration movies using an appropriate cell tracking software application, like ImageJ software plugins (an overview is given in 18). For an unbiased analysis it is of crucial importance that cells will be randomly selected without the knowledge whether cells are migratory active or not.\n\tNOTE: We are using a self-developed software application to manually track the paths of at least 30 cells per experiment by following the moving cells accurately with the mouse cursor (which is positioned to the nucleus). While tracking, the xy-coordinates of the tracked cells are automatically determined in accordance to the used time-lapse mode. For lymphocytes/HSPCs xy-coordinates are determined each 0.75 sec (equal to 1 min realtime), whereas for tumor cells the xy-coordinates are determined each 0.5 sec (equal to 15 min realtime).\nDetermine a total of 60 xy-coordinates per cell for a typical cell migration experiment. This is equal to 1 hr real-time for lymphocytes/HSPCs and 15 hr real-time for tumor cells. A “,” indicates that a cell has not moved between two time points, whereas a “numerical value” indicates the distance in “pixels” a cell has moved between 2 time points (Figure 2A).",
    "NOTE: Manual cell tracking requires experience. Particularly fast migrating cells are difficult to track and each cell type exhibit a distinct migratory behavior that might be triggered by supplemented factors. In case of cell division while tracking, randomly choose one daughter cell for continuing tracking. Cells that migrate out of the sight field or die while tracking are not neglected, but are considered for analysis.\n4. Data Analysis\nAnalyze cell tracking data by using an appropriate software application, e.g., a spreadsheet program.\n\t\nAnalyze cell tracking data by copying the cell tracking raw data (Figure 2A), into a self-designed spreadsheet template. Multiply sum of the “numerical values”, representing the total distance a cell has migrated with a correction factor to convert “pixel” into “µm”.\nDetermine two cell migration parameters: locomotory activity (which is equivalent to migration rate) and time of active movement (Figures 2C,2D).\nIdentify the cells that have migrated lesser than 25 µm (threshold level to reduce the number of false-positive cells) as non-moving cells. Replace “numerical values” of these cells with “,”.\n\t\tNOTE: The parameter “locomotory activity” (or migration rate) represents the percentage of cells of the tracked cell population that have moved between two time points (Figure 2D). A “numerical value” is defined as a moving cell, whereas “,” is defined as a non-moving cell. The parameter “time of active movement” (time active) represents the percentage of the total time a cell has migrated in relation to the time frame of the observation period (Figure 2C). A “numerical value” indicates that a cell has moved, whereas “,” indicates that a cell has not moved. This parameter is further used to determine the number of cells that has not moved.\nCalculate statistical significance and display cell migration data.",
    "Calculate statistical significance of the mean locomotory activity of the cells (migration rate) using the Mann-Whitney U test. Consider p-value < 0.05 as significant.\nDisplay the mean locomotory activity of cells as xy-diagram, BoxPlot diagram, or as a bar chart diagram. Display single cell-based data, such as time of active movement or speed, as a bar chart diagram or as a histogram.\n\t\tNOTE: If the chosen spreadsheet software application does not contain a BoxPlot chart or histogram chart tool an online search should be performed for looking for suitable tutorials.\nSubscription Required.
