    "1. Recommendations Before Starting\nDo not use PSCs contaminated with mycoplasma because they will not differentiate properly into sinus node cells. Test for mycoplasma contamination before starting the protocol. Do this using a PCR kit for rapid, highly sensitive detection of mycoplasmas and follow the manufacturer`s protocol.\nFor each Petri dish (step 2.3.4), coat one 10 cm2 cell culture dish with sterile 7 ml 0.1 % gelatin from cold water fish skin for 1 hr at 37 °C. Remove the gelatin and let the dish dry under sterile conditions in a sterile bench.\nBefore you can start the differentiation protocol you need a double transfected stable mouse ES cell line clone containing the following features: i) Constitutive over-expression of TBX3 using a mammalian expression vector. Ii) The G418 resistance gene under the control of the Myh6-promoter5.\nThe undifferentiated PSCs cells should be co-cultivated with irradiated feeder cells under standard conditions as described 1.\n2. Differentiation Procedure\nTwo Days before Differentiation - Remove PSCs from feeder cells.\n\t\nAspirate the medium, wash the cells with 10 ml phosphate buffered saline PBS, add 7 ml Collagenase IV solution and incubate the cells for 10 min at 37 °C. Place a sterile 40 µm Filter in a 50 ml tube.\nCarefully rinse the PSC colonies (avoid to remove the feeder cells) by pipetting the collagenase solution up and down 5 times.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 40 µm filter, rinse the filter three times with 8 ml PBS. Turn around the filter and place it upside down in a petri dish. Remove the PSC cell colonies by pipetting 10 ml PBS to the bottom of the filter.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 ml tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g.",
    "Remove the PBS, suspend the cells in 1 ml Accutase and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.\nAdd 10 ml PBS, mix the cell solution by pipetting it up and down 5 times and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g.\nRemove the PBS, suspend the cells in 10 ml cultivation medium and determine the cell number.\nSeed 15,000 cells/ cm2 on a 75 cm2 filter flask and cultivate them for 2 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After 2 days the flask should be 50-70% confluent.\nDay 0 - Start of Differentiation\n\t\nRemove the medium and wash the cells with 10 ml PBS.\nAspirate the PBS, add 2 ml Accutase and incubate the cells at 37 °C for 5 min. Place a sterile 40 µm Filter in a 50 ml tube.\nAdd 10 ml PBS, transfer the cell suspension to the 40 µm filter, rinse the filter via addition of 10 ml PBS and centrifuge the flow-through for 5 min at 300 x g.\nSuspend the cells in 10 ml differentiation medium and determine the cell number.\nDilute the cell suspension with differentiation medium to a final concentration of 20,000 cells/ml.\nPipette 20 ml water and 5 ml hanging drop (HD) solution in a quadratic Petri dish to avoid drying-out of the HDs.\n\t\tNOTE: For each 24 well plate containing iSABs (see section 2.8.6.4/2.8.7) start with 16 Petri dishes.\nPipette up to 50 ml cell suspension in a tray .\nTurn around the lid of the petri dish. Place 180 HDs each containing 20 µl (400 cells/HD) cell suspension onto the lid using a 12 channel pipette.\nCarefully turn around the lid and place it onto the Petri dish.",
    "NOTE: The speed of turning around the lid is very important. If the lid is turned around too slow or too fast, the surface tension of the cell suspension is not high enough to retain the hanging drops on the lid. Before trying to produce HDs for first time practice turning around the lid with 20 µl drops of medium.\nCultivate the cells for 2 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2 to let them form EBs.\n\t\tNOTE: Place one petri dish filled with water on the top of a stack of 5 Petri dishes. Otherwise the HD in the upper petri dish will dry.\nDay 2\n\t\nCarefully turn around the lid of the quadratic Petri dish and transfer the EBs derived from two Petri dishes (360 EBs) to a 50 ml tube.\nWait 10 min to let the EBs settle at the bottom of the tube (Do not centrifuge the EBs).\nAspirate as much medium as possible, suspend the EBs in 10 ml differentiation medium and transfer the suspension to a 10 cm Petri dish.\nDay 2-6 Suspension culture\n\t\nCultivate the EBs in suspension for 4 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2, change medium after 2 days.\n\t\tNOTE: Even though the petri dish is not coated (as opposed to a cell culture dish) the EBs often attach to the surface. Control the petri dishes for attached EBs every day and if necessary detach the EBs from the surface by gentle pipetting. Optional: Shake the petri dishes continuously during the suspension culture period. Be careful with the speed of the shaker. The EBs should neither accumulate in the middle nor float to the border of the Petri dishes.\nDay 6\n\t\nTransfer the EBs from one Petri dish to one gelatin coated 10 cm2 cell culture dish.\nDay 7-12",
    "The cells should start to beat after 8-12 days. Check for beating foci of the cells daily under a microscope. The cells start to form a layer.\nChange medium daily.\n\t\tNOTE: After changing medium, the cells require 3-4 hr to recover and to start beating again.\nDay 12-15 Selection of sinus nodal cells.\n\t\nThree days after the cells have started beating (around day 12-15), aspirate the medium and pipette 10 ml of fresh differentiation medium containing 400 µg/ ml G418 to the cells.\nFour days after the beginning of the selection dissociate the cell layer.\n\tNOTE: It is possible that the cell layer is already detached from the surface.\n\t\nRemove the medium carefully without aspirating the cell layer.\nAdd 10 ml of PBS and remove the PBS carefully without aspirating the cell layer.\nAdd 10 ml of Collagenase IV solution, transfer the cells to a 50 ml tube and incubate the cells at 37 °C for 5 min.\nVigorously mix the suspension by pipetting up and down 10 times and incubate the cells at 37 °C for 5 min. A suspension of small clusters should occur. If there are still huge parts of the layer left, then repeat step 2.8.4 two more times.\nAdd 20 ml of PBS and centrifuge for 10 min at 300 x g.\nAspirate the PBS carefully.\n\t\tNOTE: If iSABs are to be generated proceed with step 2.8.7. If iSAB derived sinus nodal single cells are to be generated go on with step 2.9.\nSuspend the cells in 12 ml differentiation medium containing 400 µg/ml G418 and seed them on 6 wells of gelatin coated 24 wells (2 ml/well).\nGeneration of single nodal cell.\n\t\nSuspend the cells from step 2.8.6 in 5 ml Accutase and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.",
    "Vigorously mix the suspension by pipetting up and down 10 times and incubate the cells at 37 °C for 5 min.\nAdd 20 ml of PBS and centrifuge for 5 min at 300 x g.\nSuspend the cells in 12 ml differentiation medium containing 400 µg/ml G418 and seed them on 6 wells of a gelatin coated 24 wells (2 ml/well).\nDay 2 after dissociation, aspirate the medium and wash the cells three times with PBS. Add 1 ml differentiation medium/well.\nDay 4-8 after dissociation, change Medium every 2nd day. On day 10 after Dissociation use iSABs or iSAB derived sinus nodal single cells are available for further analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
