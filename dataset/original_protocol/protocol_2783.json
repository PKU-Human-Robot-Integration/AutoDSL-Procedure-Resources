    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCharacterization of UTmS\nTiming: 40 min\nThis step verifies that the prepared UTmS-chips maintain good rigidity, superior toughness, and easy handling with tweezers.\nFix and load the UTmS chip for SEM imaging.\nFix the UTmS-chip on a metal tray with conductive tape.\nBring the SEM chamber to atmospheric pressure to open the sample door.\nOpen the door and place the metal tray into the holder.\nClose the door back into the chamber and place it back under vacuum.\nZoom in to the desired magnification and adjust the sample height to focus.\nCapture the SEM image once the sample is in focus.\nVerify that the through-hole conforms to the design requirements, including the regularity of the circle, smoothness of the edges, and uniformity of the through-hole array.\nNote: The 5 μm-thick UTmS should be perforated with smooth and regular edges without burning residues (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nThe chip remains upright and flat when lifted with tweezers, thereby verifying its good rigidity.\nCritical: An approximately 10 μm-thick PDMS layer is difficult to handle with tweezers because it easily bends, collapses or conglutinates. The UTmS-chips can be maintained upright with tweezers, rather than bent or collapsed as is the case with the PDMS layer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). Therefore, this is one of the significant advantages of metal stencils over PDMS stencils.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nThe UTmS can be bent without fracturing or creasing by bending the chip with fingers, verifying its superior toughness (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nPlace the cleaned and sterilized UTmS chip in a Petri dish and co-culture it with MCF-7 cells suspension for 3 days in an incubator.",
    "Note: Given that the action time of the UTmS in this experiment is only 20–30 min, the effect of the UTmS on the cell activity is not a concern in the single-cell patterning. The adhesion and proliferation of cells in a Petri dish verifies the biocompatibility of the UTmS chip.\nPDMS-substrate assembly\nTiming: 10–25 min\nThis step covers the top surface of different substrates with PDMS membranes, to apply the UTmS-based strategy to an arbitrary planar substrate (such as glass, silicon, metal, plastic, or polymer) for subsequent cell patterning, owing to the biological compatibility of PDMS.\nPrepare substrates with clean and planar top surfaces.\nCritical: A clean and planar surface is very important for PDMS attachment.\nPeel off a freshly-prepared PDMS layer without patterns pre-cut in step 15 (Before beginning) with tweezers.\nCritical: Be careful not to touch the PDMS surface to avoid conglutination.\nPast the uncovered fresh side of the PDMS towards the top surface of the substrate by gradually releasing the film from one end of contact to full adhesion to remove air bubbles.\nCritical: Avoid tiny bubbles that could affect the PDMS surface smoothness and adhesion.\nNote: In the event that bubbles accidentally occur, use tweezers to slowly peel off from one end and refilm. Alternatively, place the PDMS-substrates in a vacuum desiccator for 15 min to allow the trapped gas bubbles present between the surfaces to passively escape.\nGently press on the assembled device to ensure that the surfaces of the PDMS-substrate are well-bonded (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nCritical: Avoid pressing with small-headed tools, such as tweezers, to prevent rugged surfaces.\nNote: An exception to this step is that if the substrate is originally a cell culture dish (Petri dish) suitable for cell culture, thus eliminating the need for PDMS coating modification.\nFibronectin modification\nTiming: 10 h",
    "Since fibronectin has been demonstrated to promote the adhesion and proliferation of cells,12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12],13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] this step decorates the Petri dishes or PDMS surfaces with fibronectin at a high concentration before UTmS attachment to accelerate the adhesion of cells from the suspension onto the substrates.\nCritical: Handle all chemicals in a fume hood.\nOptional: In addition to fibronectin and fibrinogen, a wide variety of surface functionalization methods with adhesion promoting agents can be adopted to accelerate the single-cell trapping process without compromising performance, including collagen, (aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane, or poly-L-lysine.12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12],14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]\nPrepare a fibronectin coating solution with a final concentration of 5 μg/mL using PBS in Eppendorf tubes with sufficient mixing in a biosafety cabinet.\nNote: The fibronectin solution is expected to be stable when stored in PBS (pH 7.2–7.6) for long storage (several weeks). Therefore, the excess fibronectin solutions can be stored at 4°C.\nPause point: Fibronectin is not completely dissolved in PBS because of its non-polar nature. The pipetting time should be appropriately extended to achieve maximum dissolution and mixing.\nNote: The high concentration of fibronectin solution (5 μg/mL) aims to ensure full and high-density coverage on the Petri dish or PDMS surface by physical adsorption through non-specific interactions, thus increasing the protein adsorption probability, and the single-cell capture yield. However, it should be noted that the proper fibronectin concentration is subject to biological testing.\nOptional: We recommend the preparation a mixed coating solution, including human fibronectin and fibrinogen with final concentrations of 4 and 1.5 μg/mL using PBS, and then mixing the solution using a vortex mixer for 5 s. The coating efficiency of the mixed coating solution is higher than that of the fibronectin only solution.\nUse a custom-made PDMS gasket as the liquid chamber to hold the coating solution on the planar substrate.",
    "Note: If the required coating area is small, a droplet of fibronectin solution can be directly dispensed onto a Petri dish or PDMS surface to cover the required coating area. This operation eliminates the need for a gasket because the fibronectin solution remains in a droplet shape rather than spreading out owing to the hydrophobicity of the Petri dish or fresh PDMS surface.\nPipette the fibronectin solution into the PDMS gasket to cover the entire bottom and allow it to settle to the bottom (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nIncubate the surfaces for a minimum of 3 h at 36°C or 10 h at 4°C, which allows the fibronectin to settle until it is physically adsorbed at the bottom.\nCritical: Cover the dish with aluminum foil to prevent liquid evaporation from the dish during incubation, especially at a temperature of 36°C.\nAfter incubation, remove the soaking solution and gently wash the Petri dish with PBS using a pipette to remove unbound fibronectin.\nCritical: Do not pipette back and forth to prevent fibronectin detachment.\nCritical: Do not allow the pipette tip to touch the base when aspirating the fibronectin solution or washing with PBS to avoid damaging the protein layer.\nBlow-dry the residues with nitrogen gas until a white crystalline layer appears (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCritical: Nitrogen gas should be applied at a distance of at least 30 cm from the substrate to prevent the rapid airflow damaging the protein layer.\nCritical: During the blowing process, carefully check the protein layer on the surface, and stop blowing as soon as it becomes white to prevent overdrying of the fibronectin layer.\nStore the fibronectin-modified chips at 4°C for up to one week until the subsequent device assembly.\nFibronectin coverage characterization\nTiming: 2 h",
    "This step verifies that the immobilized fibronectin maintains a high coverage efficiency on the surface, including both the thickness and uniformity.\nCritical: Handle all chemicals in a fume hood.\nPause point: This step is optional. However, considering the limited depth of the holes after tight compaction with the stencil, the fibronectin coating thickness, which is closely related to the fibronectin concentration and incubation time, must be optimized. Therefore, characterization of the fibronectin coverage is recommended to verify physisorption to the substrate.\nPerform AFM measurements in dry mode using an AFM (Bruker Multimode V, Germany).\nAttach the fibronectin-coated PDMS membrane on a glass slide.\nPlace the prepared glass slide in the AFM sample stage.\nPlace a probe in the AFM and activate the laser and photodetector.\nUse a cantilever with Bruker DNP10 (silicon nitride with elastic coefficient of 0.6N/m).\nScan the boundary of the fibronectin area in the Scanasyst air mode.\nCreate an AFM image of the surface line by line.\nNote: Our results showed that the optimal thickness of the fibronectin layer was approximately about 550 nm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nReversible UTmS-chip assembly\nTiming: 1 h\nThis step produces a reversible UTmS-chip assembly for further cell sedimentation on the pre-coated Petri dish or PDMS surface.\nPlace the clean UTmS-chips using tweezers at the center of the freshly prepared culture dish or PDMS layer at ambient temperatures and under atmospheric pressure.\nNote: The adhesion between PDMS and UTmS-chip enables reversible UTmS-chip assembly without bonding or clamping fixation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F). See also the Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] (Operation procedure of UTmS-chip assembly and single-cell array preparation.) for this step.\nCritical: Avoid tiny bubbles or wrinkles that can affect the leak-proofness between the UTmS and substrate.",
    "Gently press on the UTmS with the finger to ensure tight contact with the substrate surface, then load with sustaining liquid without floating and leakage.\nCritical: Ensure the use of clean and sterile gloves before pressing the UTmS with the finger.\nCritical: Press the central area first and then extend it to the edges because the through-hole array is located in the central area of the UTmS chip.\nNote: Because the bonding between the UTmS and substrate is reversible, the UTmS-Chip can be easily separated by peeling off the metal stencil.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Operation procedure of UTmS-chip assembly and single-cell array preparation, related to step 18 and steps 25–29\n    \nChip assembly characterization\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step verifies whether the physical adsorption between the UTmS and wet substrate is sufficient to achieve a good leak-proofness without additional clamps. Additionally, this step also verifies whether the UTmS is sufficiently hydrophobic to meet the sample loading requirements without the use of a reaction chamber.\nPause point: This step is optional. However, contact angle measurements are recommended to verify the hydrophobicity of the UTmS surface, whereas backside fluorescence characterization is recommended to verify the leak-proofness of the UTmS-chip.\nDispense a drop of DI water on the center area of the UTmS and measure the static contact angle (SCA) using a drop shape analyzer (DSA100, Krüss, Germany).\nNote: The static contact angle measured on our through-hole-patterned area was 92° (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nCritical: No obvious static contact angle change should be observed after the routine cleaning process. Therefore, the UTmS can be reused at least nine times for single-cell patterning.",
    "Dispense Cy3 solution on the center of the UTmS surface, which remains in a droplet shape rather than spreading out owning to the hydrophobicity of the metal surface.\nCritical: The hydrophobicity of the metal surface enables that the assembled UTmS-chip can be directly sampled without requiring an additional reaction chamber.\nObserve the green fluorescence of the Cy3 droplet from the backside of the assembled UTmS-chip using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan) equipped with 10× and 20× objective lenses and a camera (DP73, Olympus).\nNote: The fluorescence intensity should be evenly distributed in the hole array, and no liquid leakage should be visible under static conditions for 3 h (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nUse a scalpel to cut the UTmS-Chip in half to observe the longitudinal section of the through-holes area.\nNote: Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I shows that there was no gap between the UTmS and substrate, and the bottom of the through-holes was well sealed.\nCritical: The fibronectin-modified surface or contact side of the UTmS must be maintained in a moist state to ensure tight adsorption between them, thus avoiding leakage of the liquid.\nCulture cells on a chip\nTiming: 100 min\nThis step will demonstrate single-cell patterning with high-density cell suspensions based on the UTmS-chip. See also the Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] (Operation procedure of UTmS-chip assembly and single-cell array preparation.) for this step.\nPrepare cell suspensions at a density of 1 × 106–3 × 106 cells per mL and mix thoroughly for subsequent cell loading.\nAfter assembling the device, pipette a drop of the cell-suspended medium onto the stencil region to cover the stencil array (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2481-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Evaluation of the UTmS-based single-cell platform\n(A) The assembled UTmS chip on a 35 mm Petri dish was loaded with a cell suspension droplet for single-cell preparation.",

Scale bar: 100 μm. Images and plot in (A–D) reproduced from Song et al. with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nTransfer the chip to a CO2 incubator at 37°C for 20 min to allow the cells to attach to the fibronectin-modified substrate under gravity-induced natural sedimentation.\nNote: The incubation time may be increased to 25–30 min depending on the cell line and their ability to attach.\nNote: Cancer cells, such as MCF and A549, require approximately 2 h to attach to a bare substrate without a fibronectin coating.\nAfter short-term cultivation, gently aspirate the cells suspension before peeling the UTmS layer and then gently rinse with a warm medium to remove the unattached cells.\nCritical: Ensure that the tip aspirates all the cell suspensions from the edge of the droplet at a very low rate to avoid damaging the weak adhesion between the cells and substrate surface through the holes.\nUse tweezer to gently peel off the UTmS from the substrate without disturbing the cell array, starting from one corner (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nCritical: Gradual tape-like peeling is beneficial for protecting newly formed single-cell arrays.\nGently rinse with a warm medium to remove the extra cells attached to a single-point cell before further incubation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nCritical: The suction and injection of liquid manipulated with a pipette must be gentle and slow to avoid detachment of cells from the array patterns.",
    "Recover the single-cell array with fresh culture medium after the peel-off process and incubate it in an incubator for another 20 min.\nCritical: Incubation for another 20 min is beneficial to strengthen cell adhesion for further downstream experiments and analyses.\nImmerse the single-cell array in PBS to maintain stable adhesion when stored for several hours.\nSingle-cell patterning evaluation\nTiming: 40 min\nThis step verifies the viability of individual cells on the fibronectin-coated Petri dish or PDMS layer, and demonstrates the high throughput of the single-cell array.\nPrepare the staining solution of FDA and Hoechst33342.\nAdd 4μL FDA (5 mg/mL) and 2 μL Hoechst solution(10 mg/mL) to 2 mL of the complete culture medium.\nMix thoroughly and maintain in dark conditions.\nNote: The final working concentration of FDA and Hoechst33342 is 10 and 10 μg/mL, respectively.\nGently aspirate the PBS in the assembled dish, and slowly add 2 mL staining solution into the Petri dish to immerse the cells.\nTransfer the device into a CO2 incubator at 37°C for 10 min.\nRemove the staining solution after incubation, and rinse the dish twice with PBS.\nImage the single-cell array using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Olympus) in the dark using a DAPI and FITC filter cube with a 10× and 20× air objective (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: The bright-field (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) and blue fluorescence images (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D) demonstrate the integrity of the nucleus of the single cells, whereas the clear green fluorescence indicates that the viability of the MCF-7 single cells on the substrate is approximately 96 ± 1.7% (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).",
    "Note: We conducted single-cell patterning on three different cancer cells using the UTmS strategy and found that each could form single-cell arrays. Our chip is suitable for single-cell array preparation of different types of cells, and there is no obvious difference in the survival rate of different single cells prepared simultaneously.\nSingle-cell apoptosis observation\nTiming: 4.5 h\nThis process validates the concept of the UTmS strategy for single-cell capture, culture, and real-time monitoring and demonstrates the heterogeneous activity of cells.\nPrepare the mixed reagent for cell apoptosis characterization.\nAdd 8μL TMRM (100 μM) and 20 μL of the STS apoptosis inducer (1 mM) to 2 mL of the complete culture medium.\nMix thoroughly and maintain the solution in the dark.\nNote: The final working concentrations of TMRM and STS are 400 nM and10 μM, respectively.\nImage a single-cell array using a Cy3 filter cube and 10× objective on an inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with temperature, humidity, and CO2 control for apoptosis assays (measurement of fluorescence intensity).\nTurn on the microscope, camera, CO2 supply, water pump, and heating unit at least 1 h before use.\nSet the heating unit temperature to 37°C and set the 10× air objective.\nPlace the assembled dish in the plate holder.\nSlowly immerse the single-cell array in PBS and add 2 mL of the mixed reagent to 10 μM STS in a 3.5-cm Petri dish.\nPrepare a control group without STS.\nSelect the positions to record using the software interface and adjust the focus, exposure time, light power, time length of the acquisition, and acquisition rate, and start imaging.",
    "Note: We used an Olympus microscope with dedicated software in our experiments. Any microscope equipped with temperature and CO2 control, air objectives, TRITC filter cube, or dedicated software can be used. We typically imaged the single-cell array in one image every 10 min for 4 h in the corresponding fluorescent channel.\nUse ImageJ to measure the gray values of the red fluorescence images of individual cells acquired at 10 min intervals (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2481-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

Here, we selected MCF cells and a Fluo-8-based calcium assay kit to conduct single-cell calcium release monitoring under the stimulation of KCl agonists, which could induce intracellular calcium release through membrane depolarization.\nPrepare 1× loading solution of Ca2+ indicator dye (Fluo-8 no wash calcium assay kit) with Fluo-8 stock solution and 1× assay buffer.\nNote: Mix thoroughly and maintain the solution in the dark.\nConstruct three single MCF-7 cell arrays in a 10 × 20 array with the UTmS-chip and independently incubate for 1 h with 1 mL Fluo-8 dye-loading solution.\nNote: Protect the entire process from light.",
    "Add 100 μL KCl solutions of 0, 100, and 200 mM to stimulate the individual cells in the three assembled devices.\nImage a single-cell array using an FITC filter cube and a 10× objective on an invert fluorescence microscope equipped with temperature, humidity and CO2 control for the calcium release assays (measurement of fluorescence intensity).\nTurn on the microscope, camera, CO2 supply, water pump, and heating unit at least 1 h before use.\nSet the heating unit temperature to 37°C and set the 10× air objective.\nPlace the assembled dish with a single MCF-7 cell arrays in a 10 × 20 array in the plate holder.\nSlowly aspirate the PBS covering the single-cell array and add Fluo-8 dye-loading solution (1×) for a 3.5-cm Petri dish.\nIncubate for 1 h in dark conditions.\nSlowly add 100 μL KCl solution to stimulate the single cells in the assembled device.\nCritical: In this experiment, three concentrations of KCL solutions (0, 100, and 200 mM) were added to the assembled device. Thereinto, 0 mM KCl was administered with DI water as the control group.\nUsing the software interface, select the positions to record, adjust the focus, exposure time, light power, time length of the acquisition, and acquisition rate, and start imaging.\nCritical: Keep the parameters constant throughout the observation period.\nNote: An Olympus fluorescence microscope was used in this step. Any microscope equipped with temperature and CO2 control, air objectives, and filter cube can be used. We typically imaged the single-cell array in one image every 5 min for 60 min in the FITC fluorescent channel.\nUse ImageJ to measure the gray values of the green fluorescence images of individual cells taken at 5-min intervals (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2481-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Stencils must be handled using tweezers.\nCleaning procedure for used UTmS-chips.\nPeel off the UTmS after single-cell patterning and immerse it in a dish or tube with trypsin at 37°C for 10 min.\nNote: Trypsinization is performed to ensure that no residual cells remain on the metal stencils.\nRemove the UTmS with tweezers and rinse with DI water.\nPlace the UTmS in a clean dish or tube with ethanol and then ultrasonically clean for 10 min.\nCritical: If the chip is dirty, a water bath at 65°C can be used as an aid for ultrasonic cleaning.\nHold the UTmS chips using tweezers and wash thoroughly with DI water to remove ethanol residues, and dry using nitrogen gas.\nSterilize the stencil using UV-ozone disinfector for 30 min.\nOptional: Vacuum vapor sterilization is also a reliable method for chip sterilization.\nPlace the UTmS under backlight observation to verify whether the cleaned UTmS has clean through holes.",
    "Critical: The UTmS is considered clean if there are no obstacles in the through-hole. Therefore, use an inverted microscope to visually verify that no defects are present in the through-hole array of the cleaned stencils.\nPlace the cleaned UTmS-chips in a 35-mm sterilized Petri dish without fixation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nNote: Seal the Petri dish with parafilm and store the UTmS-chips in a vacuum desiccator for extended periods.\nOptional: As mentioned earlier, it is also recommended to store UTmS-chips in a Gel-box with a polymer silicone layer to ensure that the chip tile is fixed on the bottom."
