    "Tissue collectionNote: Although this protocol specifies extracting and analyzing genomic DNA from ear samples, 20 mg mouse tail tip samples may also be used. PreparationCreate a plate map with samples organized top to bottom in columns (i.e., Sample 1 is in spot A1, Sample 2 is in spot B1, etc.). Remember that in every experiment, 8 sample spots need to be reserved for a standard curve, so the most mice that can be analyzed in a single qPCR is 88 (Figure 4A).Create Sample Prep solution (Recipe 1) with appropriate excess (at least 10). Using an S-Block from the Qiagen QIAcube Plasticware kit, load 160 μl of the Sample Prep solution into every well of every column needed for the experiment (Figure 4B).Note: The QIAcube HT works in column format, and every well of the columns that are used (regardless of whether they contain a sample) needs to be filled in order for the automated protocol to work properly. Seal the top of the S-block with an adhesive plate seal.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190618/20190618000329_1357.jpgFigure 4. Sample collection plate example. A.

Qiagen S-Block.Sample CollectionFill two clean vessels with enough 70% reagent alcohol to wash tools.Pre-clean tools with 70% reagent alcohol.Collect an ear sample from each mouse that is 20 mg or less using scissors or ear punch (Figure 5); using forceps, place sample into the appropriate well according to the plate map.Apply antibiotic ointment to mouse ear using cotton-tipped applicator.Note: The antibiotic swab does not usually need to be cleaned between uses, but if the mouse bleeds, we replace the soiled swab. Swish forceps and scissors in first alcohol wash, wipe with alcohol prep pad to remove any solid material such as hairs, and then swish in second alcohol wash.",
    "Leave tools in the second wash until ready to use again; do not mix up washes because the first wash should function as a “dirty wash” and the second should function as a “clean wash”.Repeat with remaining mice, changing the alcohol prep pad and cleaning gloves often.Cover S-block with adhesive when you’re done and during any extended breaks.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190618/20190618000401_1848.jpgFigure 5. An ear tissue sample that is approximately 20 mgSample digestionIn reagent reservoir, create Tissue Digestion solution (Recipe 2) with appropriate excess (at least 10), mix well, and aseptically load 40 μl into sample wells in S-block; load recipe into any “blank” wells too (wells in a used column that do not have a sample).Ensure that every sample is submerged.Seal S-block with a thermally stable adhesive plate cover; add extra security with lab tape so that the adhesive cover does not pop off during overnight digestion (samples will evaporate if this happens).Secure in a thermal shaker set to 56 °C; shake at 200 rpm overnight or up to 18 h.Genomic DNA extractionQIAcube HT setupAfter overnight sample digest, open QIAcube HT’s QIAamp 96 protocol.Follow the setup wizard in the QIAamp 96 QIAcube HT protocol to input sample number and make the following customizations.Make elution volume 150 μl (Figure 6A). Note: In our hands, 150 μl elution produces sample yield between 10-50 ng/μl, which we found to be the best range for sample dilution. You may need to change elution volume to optimize yield range.  Remove Top Elute (change volume to 0) (Figure 6B).Note: With experimentation, we found that using Top Elute is messy and does not improve sample yield or quality. Set up deck according to the specifications on the software program.Deionize the deck with an ionizing gun or fan prior to running the protocol.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190618/20190618000436_2876.jpgFigure 6. QIAcube setup. A.",
    "Set Elution Buffer to 150 μl. B. Set Top Elute volume to 0 μl.Storage: once the protocol is finished, cover the elution plate with adhesive tape and lid, label, and store at 4 °C until ready to use.Note: The kit instructs the user to use the rubber tube caps, but we find that to be cumbersome and have an increased chance of liquid flicking into another well.Genomic DNA DilutionUse a plate reader or MultiDrop to take 260 nm, 280 nm, and 320 nm readings of the DNA (if using a plate reader, dilute gDNA 1:10 in water in a UV plate).Quantify the concentration and 260/280 ratio; ensure that 260/280 values are approximately 1.8.Note: Another ratio that indicates sample purity is 260/230. Ideal 260/230 values are at least 1.0, but we have not found that 260/230 values have a significant effect on qPCR results so it is not further addressed in this protocol. Find the samples with the highest concentration; choose one dilution factor for the whole plate that ensures that the highest concentration sample does not exceed 1 ng/μl and the lowest concentration sample is not lower than 0.02 ng/μl.Dilute all samples in PCR-clean water in a new plate and mix well.Standard curve setupCombine and mix several samples’ worth of high-quality genomic DNA made from several different SOD1G93A mice to a total of approximate 100 μl of mixed sample.Find the concentration (ideally, use a NanoDrop for most accurate results); take a few replicates to make absolutely sure.Dilute the sample down to 2 ng/μl in 80 μl volume with PCR-clean water; save remaining mixed gDNA stock at -20 °C for future standard curves.",
    "Starting with 70 μl of 2 ng/μl gDNA, make 8 serial two-fold dilutions in PCR-clean water in one column of a PCR plate; this creates a standard curve where the most-concentrated sample is 2 ng/μl and the least is 0.016 ng/μl (Figure 7).Note: You can make more than one standard curve at a time if you use them a lot, and store them at 4 °C. Cover with adhesive plate sealer and store at 4 °C. Use aseptic technique every time you use the standard curve.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190618/20190618000509_4306.jpgFigure 7. Standard curve setup in a 96-well mixer plateqPCR setupPrimer setupDilute dry primers according to the “Primer Dilution solution” (Recipe 3); leave on the bench for 10 min, vortex, and spin down.Aliquot into 100 μl aliquots, label, and store at -20 °C.Aliquot wet probes into 20 μl aliquots, label, and store at -20 °C.qPCR Master MixMake master mix according to the “SOD1G93A Copy Number Genotyping qPCR Master Mix solution” (Recipe 4), using appropriate excess (be sure to include standard curve in sample number calculations and make enough for two genes, SOD1 and Gapdh).Create SOD1 and Gapdh mixes according to the “Primer/Probe solution” (Recipe 5), using appropriate excess. Remember when calculating excess that you can use at most half of the number of excess samples that you used for the master mix for the SOD1 and Gapdh mixes. Mix gently; store at 4 °C covered with foil until ready to use (not more than 1-2 h).Label 2 96-well PCR plates “SOD1” and “Gapdh”, respectively.Aliquot 4 μl of diluted unknown gDNA into each plate.Add 4 μl of standard curve after the last column of samples on the Gapdh plate.Aliquot 20 μl of SOD1 master mix to each sample well of the SOD1 plate; pipette mix very well but do not introduce bubbles.",
    "Repeat with Gapdh plate and master mix.Spin plates at 180 x g for 3 min.Starting with the SOD1 plate, pipette 9.8 μl duplicates across a 384-well qPCR plate with an 8-channel pipette so that the samples occupy rows A, C, E, G, etc. Repeat with Gapdh directly under the SOD1 rows so that Gapdh samples occupy rows B, D, F, H, etc.; make sure to include standard curve (Figure 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190618/20190618000535_8033.jpgFigure 8. A few example columns of a qPCR plate map in a 384-well plate. Gapdh standard curve samples would be added to the final two columns in duplicate after all samples have been added.Spin at 400 x g for 3 min.Seal the plate with an optical plate sealer and run a standard-length TaqMan qPCR (Figure 9).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190618/20190618000605_5139.jpgFigure 9.
