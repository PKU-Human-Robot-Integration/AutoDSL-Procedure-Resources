    "1. Preparation of the Solution\nPrepare a solution of Poly (ε-caprolactone) (PCL) (Mw= 80,000 g/mol) at an approximate concentration of 100 mg/ml. Dissolve PCL in a mixture of dichloromethane (DCM) and N, N-dimethlyformamide (DMF) at a ratio of 4:1 (v/v) with a concentration of 10% (w/v).\nPlace the solution in a 20 ml glass tube for mixing. Place glass tube into ultrasonic cleaner for 30 minutes, or until solution is translucent.\n2. Apparatus Preparation\nAdd the prepared PCL solution into a 5 ml syringe with a 21 gauge blunt needle attached.\nPlace syringe pump in a vertical electrospinning position, according to Figure 1.\nUse a stainless steel-gap collector with an open space of 2 cm x 5 cm for the aligned fiber substrate. Place the collector 12 cm from the needle tip.\nConnect the Direct Current (DC) High Voltage power supply to the needle and ground the collector. Ensure that the collector is individually grounded with no contact to the other lab equipment.\n3. Electrospinning\nSet syringe pump to 1.50 ml/hr, until the droplets forming at the needle tip are immediately replaced when removed. Then, set the flow rate to 0.50 ml/hr.\nTurn the voltage operator to 12 kV.\nElectrospin until the uniaxially aligned fibers completely cover the gap on the collector.\nApply glue to the edges of a small glass plate and transfer the fibers from the gap collector to the glass plate. Place the glass plate on the top of a piece of aluminum foil that has the same size as the glass plate and is grounded.\nPosition the second syringe collector according to Figure 3.\nAttach the plastic mask to the second syringe pump and position it 2 mm above the collector.",
    "Add Coumarin 6 at 1% (w/w) to the PCL solution—if nanoencapsulation is desired— and mix until the solution is translucent.\nLoad the PCL or PCL/Coumarin 6 solution into a 5 ml needle with a blunt 21 gauge needle. Set vertical pump to 0.50 ml/hr and horizontal to pull at 9 ml/hr or at an approximate speed of 1 mm/min.\nElectrospin until the mask has moved almost completely off the collector, but with the edge area still under the mask.\n4. Fiber Characterization\nPlace samples with double-sided conductive tape to the metallic stud and coat with platinum for 40 sec using a sputter coater at 40 mA.\n\t\nExamine fibers through scanning electron microscope (SEM) according to our previous studies17,18.\nCollect images at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.\nPerform fast Fourier transform (FFT) analysis on a separate fiber sample to measure fiber alignment. The detailed information on measuring fiber alignment by FFT can refer to previous studies19,20.\n5. Seeding Stem Cells.\nSterilize the fiber samples by soaking in a 70% ethanol solution for 2 hr. Then wash the fibers with distilled water to remove any contaminants.\nObtain human ADSCs and culture cells in a 25 cm2 flask at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air/5% CO2. Change the cell culture medium every other day10.",
    "Trypsinize the cells and count the number of cells. Specifically, remove all culture medium from the cell culture flask and wash the cells with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) twice. Then add 1 ml of a 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution (pre-warm in water bath to 37 °C) to cover the cell monolayer and incubate the flask in the cell culture incubator for 2-3 minutes. Add 4 ml culture medium and wash out all the cells from the surface by pipetting the medium all over the surface. Centrifuge the cell suspension and re-disperse the cell pellet in the culture medium. Count cells via hemacytometer. Seed around 1 × 104 cells to the nanofiber scaffold placed in a 35 mm -culture dish and incubate for 3 and 7 days.\nStain cells using fluorescein diacetate (5 mg/ml in acetone) (FDA) then image the samples using a fluorescent microscope. Specifically, add 100 μl of FDA solution to the culture dish and incubate for 30 min. Wash cells with PBS three times before fluorescent imaging. Analyze cell orientation by a customized mat-lab program based on our previous studies10.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
