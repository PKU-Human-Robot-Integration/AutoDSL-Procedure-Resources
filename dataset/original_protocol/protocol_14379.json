    "All methods described here have been approved by a local clinical research ethics committee in Hong Kong.\nNote: For simplicity, the equipment listed in the Table of Materials is used to illustrate the procedures of retinal imaging and subsequent analysis. Measurement of retinal vascular parameters is illustrated using the Singapore I Vessel Assessment program (SIVA) 17 (Version 4.0, National University of Singapore, Singapore). However, it should be noted that a different set of equipment can be adopted as the underlying principles remain similar.\n1. Prepare the Subjects for Retinal Imaging\nDilate the subjects’ pupils using a mydriatic agent. Wait for at least 15 min to establish sufficient pupil dilation.\n2. Measure Retinal Vascular Parameters from Fundus Photographs Using a Computer-assisted Analysis program\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56137/56137fig1v2.jpg\nFigure 1: Schematic diagram showing the procedures of measuring retinal vascular parameters. (A) Obtain optic-disc-centered fundus photographs using a fundus camera. Figure 1A and Figure 2A are two fundus photographs with optimal quality. (B) Upload the fundus photographs to the cloud-based server and enter relevant study details, including the image conversion factor (ICF). Other computer-assisted analysis programs may use non-cloud-based methods to organize and store the images. (C) Open the fundus photograph in the computer-assisted analysis program. (D) Mark the location of optic disc center, and (E) prompt the software to automatically detect the rim of optic disc and place a measurement grid. (F) Construct vessel tracings based on the vessel paths, and lay vessel covers to estimate the diameters of the vessels. (G) Adjust the incorrect vessel tracings and vessel covers manually. (H) Measure a spectrum of retinal vascular parameters, including vessel calibers, tortuosity, fractal dimension and bifurcation. Step (D) to Step (F), and Step (H) can be automatically performed by some computer-assisted analysis programs.

    "Capture fundus photographs using a fundus camera.\nTurn on the fundus camera and launch the image capturing program on the computer. Rest the chin of the subject properly on the chinrest with the forehead against the head strap. Move the control lever to align the light beam properly to the subject’s pupil.\nAlign the illumination points until both appear smallest on both sides in the viewfinder. Move the external fixation target to guide the subject’s eyes until the optic disc is at the center of the viewfinder and the regions of interest (ROI) are well within the boundaries. Adjust the focusing knob to focus on the retina.\nHave the subject firmly look at the external fixation target and ensure the subject’s eyes are not filled with tears.\nDepress the shutter-release button to capture an image (Figure 1A).\nCheck the quality of the fundus photograph captured, using Figure 2A as a standard. Discard the image and repeat the image acquisition process (i.e., Step 2.1.1 to 2.1.4) if the pupil is poorly dilated (Figure 2B), the optic disc is not at the center of the image (Figure 2C), or the image is out of focus (Figure 2D).\nSave the image in TIFF format with gradable resolution (i.e., approximately 3,000 pixels x 2,000 pixels, at more than 150 dpi).\n\t\tNote: The protocol can be paused here.\nRepeat Steps 2.1.1 to 2.1.6 to acquire fundus photographs for other subjects.\nSelect a 10% sample of images randomly and measure the height of optic discs in these images (Figure 3). Calculate the image conversion factor (ICF) using the formula:\n\t\tICF = 1,800 µm/(Average pixel height of optic discs of the images sampled).\nUpload the captured fundus photographs to the cloud-based server and enter relevant study details, including the image conversion factor (ICF) (Figure 1B).",
    "Note: The protocol can be paused here. Other computer-assisted analysis programs may use other non-cloud-based methods to organize the images and record the ICF.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56137/56137fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Fundus photographs with optimal and suboptimal quality. The image quality of a fundus photograph must be checked immediately after image acquisition, as the image quality directly affects the subsequent measurement of retinal vascular parameters. The image should be discarded if one of these artefacts is observed. These images were captured using a 50° fundus camera.

To calculate the ICF, randomly select a 10% sample of images from the study (Step 1). Then, measure the height of optic discs (in pixels) from the images sampled (Step 2). Calculate the ICF using the formula: ICF= 1800 µm / (Average pixel height of optic discs of the sampled images), where 1800 µm is approximately the height of a normal optic disc (Step 3). As magnification effect and image resolution differ from camera to camera, it is necessary to calculate an accurate ICF for each camera used.

Construct vessel tracings and lay vessel covers for the retinal vasculature.\n\tNote: In this section, the SIVA program is used to illustrate the procedures. However, the SIVA program can be substituted by other available computer-assisted analysis programs. In addition, Steps 2.2.2 to 2.2.3 are automatically performed by some computer-assisted analysis programs when a fundus photograph is opened (i.e. Step 2.2.1).\n\t\nOpen the fundus photograph with the computer-assisted analysis program (Figure 1C).\nMark the location of the optic disc centre (Figure 1D).",
    "Click the “OD Center” button on the left function panel; the mouse cursor will be replaced by a green circle.\nMove the green circle to the center of the optic disc (OD), and left-click to fix the circle.\nPrompt the software to automatically place a measurement grid, construct vessel tracings and lay vessel covers (Figure 1E and 1F).\n\t\t\tNote: Vessel covers are measurement lines that estimate the approximate width of the internal lumens of the vessels.\n\t\t\t\nClick the “Find OD” button to prompt the software to detect the OD rim and place four concentric circles as a measurement grid, based on the position of the OD center.\nClick the “Process” button to initiate the automatic vessel tracing process.\nAdjust incorrect vessel tracings manually. Begin the inspection from the 12 o’clock position in a clockwise manner to ensure that all vessel tracings are verified.\nCheck that the optic disc is accurately detected and the measurement grid is correctly placed. Adjust the measurement grid manually following steps 2.2.2 to 2.2.3, if the innermost circle does not accurately outline the optic disc rim (Figure 4A).\nLeft click to select vessel tracing(s) labelled with incorrect vessel type (arterioles versus venules) and click the “Vessel (T)ype” button to change the vessel type.\n\t\tNote: Arterioles are labelled in red and venules are labelled in blue. Arterioles can be distinguished from venules based on their physiological differences. For example, venules are generally darker in color and wider than arterioles. Vessels with same vessel type usually do not cross each other.\nExtend incomplete vessel tracings following steps 2.3.3.1 to 2.3.3.2 (Figure 4B).\n\t\t\nUse the cursor to click at the distal end of the incomplete vessel tracing. Left click at points along the vessel path to extend the vessel tracing.",
    "Stop the tracing process when the distal end of the vessel is reached. Stop the tracing at the outermost white circle if the distal part of the vessel falls outside the measurement grid (see Figure 4B).\nAdjust vessel tracings if the vessel paths are not traced correctly at the crossover site (Figure 4C).\n\t\t\nClick the “Select” button and then click at the incorrect point of the vessel tracing. Click the “Brea(k) Seg” button to disconnect the vessel tracing at the point selected. Select the disconnected segment and click the “(Del) Seg” button to delete it.\nRe-construct a new vessel tracing using steps 2.3.3.1 and 2.3.3.2.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56137/56137fig4.jpg\nFigure 4: Common errors of the auto-tracing. The automatic vessel tracing is not completely accurate and manual adjustments are required to ensure the accuracy of measurement. This figure shows common errors of the auto-tracing and demonstrates optimal results after manual adjustments. (A) The optic disc center is incorrectly marked and this lead to deviation of the measurement grid, which may affect the subsequent measurements. Ideally, the innermost circle of the measurement grid should outline the optic disc rim. (B) Incomplete vessel tracing could lead to the incorrect measurement of fractal dimension, tortuosity, etc. The vessel path should be traced until the end of the vessel. If the distal part of the vessel falls outside the measurement grid, the tracing can be stopped at the outermost white circle. (C) Vessel tracings at the crossover sites are subject to a higher tendency of error and thus require special attention.

    "Check if all vessel covers are correctly placed. Left-click and drag the cursor to deactivate vessel covers if the covers are not laid perpendicular to the vessel walls (Figure 5A), the vessel path is obscured by another vessel (Figure 5B), or the covers overestimate or underestimate the width of the vessel lumen (Figure 5C).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56137/56137fig5.jpg\nFigure 5: Incorrect vessel covers. This figure shows examples of incorrect vessel covers that should be deactivated and excluded from the subsequent measurement. Vessel covers should be deactivated if they are not perpendicular to the vessels (A). In addition, Vessel covers should also be deactivated if the vessel being traced is obscured under another vessel (B), or the vessel covers cannot represent the approximate width of the vessel (C).

    "Identify all vessels in zone C with a width >40 µm. Calculate the retinal arteriolar and venular tortuosity from the integral of the total squared curvature along the vessel tracings and normalize the value with the total arc length, bowing, and points of inflection27,28.\nCompute the total, arteriolar, and venular fractal dimensions from zone C, using the established “box-counting method”29,30,31.\n\t\t\nDivide the image into a series of equally sized squares.\nCount the number of boxes containing a section of the vessel tracings.\nRepeat the process using a series of equally sized squares with different sizes.\nPlot the logarithm of the number of boxes containing the vessel tracings against the logarithm of the size of the boxes, and calculate the slope of the resulting line; this is the fractal dimension.\nIdentify vessels with first bifurcation in zone C and calculate the angles (θ) subtended between the first two daughter vessels32 (Figure 6C). Compute the mean value to obtain the average branching angle.\nCalculate the branching coefficient from zone C using the formula:\n\t\t(d12 + d22)/d02, where d0 is the mean trunk caliber, and d1 and d2 are the mean branch calibers (Figure 6C).\nClose the grading window. Click “send” in the pop-up dialog to upload the graded image to the cloud-based server and record the automatically measured retinal vascular parameters.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56137/56137fig6.jpg",
    "Figure 6: Quantification of retinal vasculature. (A) Zone B (defined as 0.5-1.0 disc diameters away from the disc margin) is used to measure vessel calibers of zone B according to the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. Zone C (defined as 0.5-2.0 disc diameters away from the disc margin) is used to measure vessel calibers of zone C and a spectrum of retinal vascular network parameters (such as tortuosity, fractal dimension, and bifurcation). (B) Vessel covers are measurement lines used to estimate the retinal vessel calibers (or diameters). Incorrect vessel covers should be manually excluded from the measurement. (C) For all vessels that have their first bifurcation within zone C, the program automatically measures the branching angles (θ) of the first bifurcation. In addition, the branching coefficient is also calculated using the formula: Branching coefficient = (d12 + d22)/d02, where d0 is the trunk caliber, and d1 and d2 are the branch calibers.

Assess the Thickness of GC-IPL and RNFL\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56137/56137fig7.jpg\nFigure 7: Schematic diagram showing the procedures of measuring RNFL and GC-IPL thickness. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used to measure thicknesses of the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GC-IPL) and the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). (A, B) Measure the GC-IPL and RNFL thicknesses using the built-in “macular cube” and “optic disc cube” scanning protocols respectively. (C, D) Check the image quality immediately after image acquisition. Discard the image and repeat the scan if the signal strength is smaller than 6, or motion artefacts are detected.

    "Figure 9: Retinal layers used for the assessment of the retinal neuronal structure. The retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) is measured using the optic nerve head (ONH) algorithm, while the ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer is measured using the ganglion cell analysis (GCA) algorithm. The ONH algorithm segments the inner and outer boundary of the RNFL to measure the thickness of RNFL. The GCA algorithm detects the outer boundary of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and the inner plexiform layer (IPL) to yield the combined thickness of the ganglion-cell layer (GCL) and the IPL. The thicknesses of GCL and the IPL are measured together, as the boundary between GCL and IPL is anatomically indistinct. However, the combined thickness of GCL and IPL (i.e. GC-IPL) is still indicative of the health of RGCs.
