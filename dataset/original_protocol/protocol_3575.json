    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHarvest the spleen, homogenize and lyse red blood cells\nTiming: ∼30 min\nThese steps lay out how to obtain single-cell suspension of white blood cells from mouse spleens.\nOn the day of the harvest (7 days after immunization for GC B cells or same day for B cell purification from naive animals), euthanize mice by CO2 asphyxiation according to institutional guidelines.\nNote: If downstream applications require sterile conditions, please perform all steps in a laminar flow hood. Sterilize all equipment with 70% ethanol or by autoclave (before utilization in the hood).\nLay mouse on the side with the left side upwards on a paper towel. Spray mouse with 70% ethanol for easier incision. With dissecting scissors (and the aid of dissecting forceps) cut away skin and open the body cavity around the midline of the mouse. Carefully lift the spleen up with the dissecting forceps and cut the vessels and other attachments at the hilum of the spleen with the dissecting scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]; numbers 1–4).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/498-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Spleen harvest, homogenization, and red blood cell lysis for single-cell suspension of white blood cells\nPlace isolated spleen in a 15-mL conical tube filled with 4 mL PBS on ice. Collect additional spleens if applicable.\nPour the collected spleen together with the PBS into a 60-mm cell culture dish on a stable surface. Save the 15-mL conical tube for the homogenized cell solution below.\nDissociate the spleen mechanically using gentle force between the rough ends of frosted microscope slides (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]; numbers 5–9).\nWork through the spleen in smaller segments and dip ends in the PBS of the dish for cells to flush off before moving onto the next segment of the spleen until the whole spleen is homogenized.",
    "Pipette carefully (with a P1000) the homogenized cell solution (∼4 mL) back into the 15-mL conical tube. Layer the tube with a precut 70 μm Nylon mesh (or a cell strainer) to filter the solution.\nRinse remaining cells in the dish with 1–2 mL cold PBS and pipette the remainder of the cells (through the Nylon mesh) into the conical tube.\nSpin down the conical tube at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C to pellet the homogenized cells.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]; number 10) in 3 mL ACK buffer for 3 min at 20°C–25°C (room temperature) to lyse red blood cells.\nAdd 7 mL cold PBS to dilute ACK buffer and quench the lysis.\nSpin down the conical tube at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C to pellet the white blood cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]; number 11).\nCritical: Ensure red blood cells have been efficiently removed from the pellet, which should appear white. Do not leave cells > 4 min in ACK buffer (step 6) as this can affect the cell viability of white blood cells. Generally, one round of lysis is enough to remove most red blood cells, however when combining spleens more volume or an additional round might be required.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend white blood cells in 10 mL cold PBS.\nDetermine the total cell number by a hemocytometer or an automated cell counter.\nSave a small aliquot of the cell solution for flow cytometry pre-purification analysis (for step 31) of B cells and/or GC B cells on ice.\nSpin down the conical tube at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C.",
    "Note: Cell clumps may form during this process and can be removed with a pipette tip or through additional filtering (70 μm Nylon mesh or Cell strainer).\nMACS purification of B cells or GC B cells\nTiming: ∼45 min (B cell purification), ∼1 or 2 h (GC B cell purification 1-step or 2-step)\nThese steps lay out how to purify B cells or GC B cells from the single-cell suspension using depletion of other cell populations by magnetic separation.\nAspirate the supernatant from step 9 in the tube with the enumerated white blood cell pellet.\nResuspend 1 × 107 cells in 100 μL MACS buffer.\nAdjust total volume accordingly to total cell number. (Example: 45 × 106 cells are resuspended in 450 μL MACS buffer).\nAdd 10 μL anti-CD43 MicroBeads per 1 × 107 cells.\nAdjust to the total cell number of white blood cells. (Example: Add 45 μL anti-CD43 MicroBeads to 45 × 106 cells).\nGently shake or flick the tube.\nLabel cells for 10–15 min on ice.\nAdd 1 mL MACS buffer for each 1 × 107 cells and spin tube at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C.\n(Example: add 4.5 mL MACS buffer onto 45 × 106 cells)\nWhile spinning, place LS column in the magnet and equilibrate each column with 3 mL MACS buffer (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] example; left).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/498-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. MACS magnet setup for column equilibration and cell collection\nEnsure buffer has completely passed column.\nPlace new uncapped 15-mL conical tube under the column (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] example; right).\nNote: Load up to 1 × 108 cells per LS column to ensure the efficient binding of labeled cells to the column. Spleens can be combined if the total cell number does not exceed this value.",
    "Optional: Placing the collection tubes on ice can decrease cell death.\nRemove supernatant from anti-CD43 MicroBeads-labeled cell pellet and resuspend the pellet in 500 μL MACS buffer (for up to 1 × 108 cells) and load onto equilibrated column.\nOnce cells passed the column reservoir, add 6 mL of MACS buffer.\nOnce buffer passed the column reservoir, add additional 3 mL of MACS buffer.\nSolution captured (∼9.5 mL) in the 15-mL conical tube contains unlabeled B cells. Labeled non-B cells (CD43+) are bound onto the column in the magnet.\nCritical: Stop here if naive B cells were purified from (unimmunized) naive mice. Determine naive B cell number, wash cells, and use in the desired downstream assay. Also, save a small aliquot for flow cytometry post-purification analysis (for step 31) on ice. Continue with steps below if GC B cell purification from immunized mice is used.\nDetermine purified B cell number and spin tube at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend 1 × 107 cells in 100 μL MACS buffer (as described in step 11).\nAdd the following biotin-conjugated antibodies per 1 × 107 cells and adjust the concentration/volumes to the total B cell number accordingly:\n4 μL (0.2 μg) of diluted anti-CD38-biotin (dilute stock at 0.5 μg/μL 1:10 in PBS to 0.05 μg/μL).\n2 μL (0.01 μg) of diluted anti-CD11c-biotin (dilute stock at 0.5 μg/μL 1:100 in PBS to 0.005 μg/μL).\nGently shake or flick the tube.\nLabel cells for 10–15 min on ice.\nAdd 1 mL MACS buffer for each 1 × 107 cells and spin tube at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend each 1 × 107 cells in 100 μL MACS buffer.",
    "Add 20 μL of anti-biotin MicroBeads for each 1 × 107 cells (adjust total volume to the total B cell number accordingly).\nGently shake or flick the tube.\nLabel cells for 10 min on ice.\nAdd 1 mL MACS buffer for each 1 × 107 cells and spin tube at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C.\nWhile spinning, place a new LS column in the magnet and equilibrate MACS LS column with 3 mL MACS buffer (as described in step 15).\nRemove supernatant from anti-biotin MicroBeads-labeled cell pellet and resuspend pellet in 500 μL MACS buffer and load onto the newly equilibrated column (as described in step 16).\nNote: Alternatively, GC B cell purification steps can be combined into a 1-step protocol loaded onto a single column. For this, white blood cells are resuspended (step 11) and are labeled together with anti-CD43 MicroBeads (as used in step 12), anti-CD38-biotin and anti-CD11c-biotin (as used in step 19) for 15 min on ice. After this, cells are washed (step 21). The cells are then labeled with anti-biotin MicroBeads, washed and loaded onto a single column (steps 22–27). This leads to the purification of GC B cells as described below.\nOnce the buffer has completely passed the column, place screwcap onto the 15-mL conical tube containing the purified GC B cells and spin at 400 × g for 3–5 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant leaving a small residual volume of ∼50 μL to not disturb the pellet, resuspend GC B cell pellet in 1 mL cold PBS and transfer the GC B cell suspension into a 1.5-mL Microcentrifuge tube (prechilled on ice).\nNote: GC B cell pellet may be barely visible.\nDetermine the cell number of GC B cells.",
    "Save a small aliquot for flow cytometry post-purification analysis (for step 31) on ice.\nPurity analysis by flow cytometry\nTiming: ∼30 min\nThese steps lay out how to analyze pre-sort total splenocytes and the purity of purified B cells and/or GC B cells by flow cytometry.\nAliquots of total splenocytes, purified B cells and/or GC B cells (step 8 and 16 and/or 30) are transferred to 1.1-mL Mini tubes (or 5-mL Round bottom tubes).\nUse up to 1 × 106 cells per stain. For GC B cells, low input may be used but ideally a minimum of 5 × 104 cells should be used.\nAdd 1 mL of Staining buffer to the sample tubes.\nSpin at 400 × g for 3–5 min at 4°C.\nWhile spinning, make an antibody staining master mix for 50 μL per stain with the following antibody dilutions:\n0.5 μL (0.25 μg) of anti-CD16/CD32 Fc Block (0.5 μg/μL; final dilution 1:100).\n0.5 μL (0.1 μg) of anti-B220-APC-eFluor780 (0.2 μg/μL; final dilution 1:100).\n0.1 μL (0.05 μg) of anti-GL7-FITC (0.5 μg/μL; final dilution 1:500).\n0.5 μL (0.1 μg) of anti-FAS-PE-Cy7 (0.2 μg/μL; final dilution 1:100).\n(Example: For 6 stains, in a 1.5-mL tube add 300 μL Staining buffer, 3 μL anti-CD16/CD32, 3 μL anti-B220-APC-eFluor780, 0.6 μL anti-GL7-FITC and 3 μL anti-FAS-PE-Cy7.)",
    "Optional: Different antibody conjugations or combinations of (GC) B cell markers may be suitable based on the specification of the flow cytometer used. Please refer to a spectral viewer tool (such as BD Spectrum Viewer) for easy setup and compatibility of the flow panel. The settings in this protocol are based on a BD FACSCanto flow cytometer equipped with 488 nm blue and 633 nm red lasers, which allows for multicolor analysis of up to six fluorescent markers and two scatter parameters. For B cell purity analysis from naive animals, markers of GC B cells (GL7 and FAS) are not required.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and scratch the 1.1-mL Mini tubes over the rack to disturb the pellet. Add ∼50 μL of the staining solution made in step 33 to each sample tube. Vortex quickly.\nIncubate cells for 15 min on ice in the dark.\nNote: While staining the cells, make single compensation controls using Compensation Beads with the following combinations 1) unstained, 2) anti-B220-APC-eFluor780, 3) anti-GL7-FITC and 4) anti-FAS-PE-Cy7. For this, add one small drop of Compensation Beads into 1.1-mL tubes and add ∼1 μL of indicated antibodies to each compensation control. Stain for 5–10 min in the dark and wash with 1 mL staining buffer once staining of the cells (above) is completed.\nAdd 1 mL Staining buffer and spin cells at 400 × g for 3–5 min at 4°C.\nCarefully aspirate supernatant of tubes and resuspend in Staining buffer corresponding to the cell number (∼500 μL for 1 × 106 cells; add 50 μL to the compensation controls).",
    "1.1-mL Mini tubes are placed in a 5-mL Round bottom tube to properly seal and be placed in position for the Sample Injection Port (SIP) of the flow cytometer. Remove 1.1-mL Mini tube between samples from the 5-mL Round bottom tube.\nNote: A viability dye such as 7-AAD allows for efficient exclusion of dead cells in addition to FSC/SSC gating. For this, resuspend the stained cell sample (step 37) in 100 μL Staining buffer and add 5 μL 7-AAD. Incubate cells 5–10 min on ice in the dark and then add ∼400 μL Staining buffer and continue with the steps below. (Please note that unstained cells incubated with 7-AAD are required as a compensation control).\nFor first time acquisition of this stain on a flow cytometer:\nAdjust FSC and SSC (and other channels) with unstained cell sample.\nSet compensation based on single compensation controls.\nFMO (Fluorescence Minus One) controls can help with gating strategies.\nAcquire samples on flow cytometer and analyze purities in FlowJo."
