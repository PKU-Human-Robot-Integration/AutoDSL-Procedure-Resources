    "The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University. Informed consent was obtained from the patient before inclusion in the study.\n1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria\nSelect patients according to the following inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria.\n\t\nInclusion criteria: 1) LNBD patients with severe neurological symptoms; 2) patients with complete clinical data, including basic data, treatment records, and imaging data.\nExclusion criteria: 1) neurological symptoms due to a herniated lumbar disc; 2) more complicated surgical techniques due to fracture, degeneration, spondylolisthesis, infection, and other factors.\nEnsure that the patients receive a complete physical examination and imaging examination before surgery, and confirm that the patients have no surgical contraindications. When everything is ready, arrange for the surgery for the patient.\n2. Preoperative and surgical procedures\nBefore providing surgical anesthesia, reconfirm the patient information.\nAfter general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, place the patient in a prone position, and employ a frame to reduce the pressure in the patient's abdominal cavity. Use iodophor to sterilize the surgical area, and cover the patient with sterile sheets.\nUse a routine posterior approach through a midline 15 cm incision at the operation site.\nUse a scalpel to incise the skin and each layer of tissue in turn, and separate the tissues around the spinous processes, vertebral laminas, and articular processes.\nExpose the L3, L4, and L5 spinous processes, lamina, and articular processes with the help of retractors. Pay attention to hemostasis during this process.\nTake the apex of the triangular groove between the lateral edge of the vertebral lamina and the transverse process as the nail entry point.",
    "According to the angle of the pedicle shown in the imaging data, place the pedicle screws into the pedicle and vertebral body under the guidance of the pedicle probe. Insert six pedicle screws into L3, L4, and L5.\nExcise the spinous processes, lamina, and articular processes of the corresponding segments with bone knives and rongeurs. Carefully peel off other tissues in the spinal canal around the dural sac, such as ligaments and fat, to eliminate the factors oppressing the dural sac and nerve root.\n\tNOTE: Do not damage the nerve roots and dural sac during this process.\nAfter exposing the L3/L4 and L4/L5 discs, use a scalpel and a rongeur to remove the surface fibrous ring, and use a curet to remove the nucleus pulposus and the fibrous ring in front of the intervertebral disc space. Finally, use a disc shaver of the appropriate size to smooth the irregular surface of the cartilage endplate.\nFill the autologous bone from the resected spinous processes, transverse processes, and vertebral laminas of the patient into cages of appropriate sizes, and place the cages in the middle of the intervertebral spaces. Place the remaining autologous bone around the cages. If the autologous bone is insufficient, take part of the patient's iliac bone.\nBend the rods to adapt to the inclination of the pedicle screws, place the rods in the groove of the pedicle screws on each side, and use the nuts to closely connect the rods and the pedicle screws. Confirm the correct position of rods and the pedicle screws by intraoperative X-ray examination.",
    "Use compressors to reduce the distance between the screws and shorten the spine. Ensure that the shortened distance allows the cage to be firmly fixed in the intervertebral space. Lock all the nuts. Check the tension of the nerve roots in the intervertebral foramen to ensure that the nerve roots are not compressed.\nPlace a silicone drainage tube (F18) at the distal end of the incision site, and fix the drainage tube with a suture. Flush the surgical field with a large amount of saline. Fully stop the bleeding with bipolar electrocoagulation. Suture each layer of tissue and skin in turn. Finally, bandage the wound with sterile dressings.\n3. Postoperative treatment\nGive the patient the first-generation cephalosporin treatment according to the guidelines within 24 h after surgery.\nTwo to three days after the surgery, when the drainage volume is less than 50 mL, remove the drainage tube.\nIf the patient has no contraindications, use low-molecular-weight heparin (4,250 IU, subcutaneous injection every day) to prevent deep vein thrombosis until discharge.\nIf venous thromboembolism is not detected by postoperative deep vein ultrasound scanning, allow the patient to walk with the assistance of a thoracolumbosacral orthosis 3 days after the surgery. Use the orthosis for at least 3 months.\n4. Follow-up of patients\nInstruct all patients to have outpatient follow-ups 1-2 months and 6 months after the surgery, and ensure that they receive a physical examination (mainly sensory and muscle strength) and radiological examination (X-ray, CT, and MRI).\nSubscription Required.
