    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBehavioral testing setup\nTiming: varies, up to 1 week\nSoftware. To implement the custom-made real-time tracking software (Kermen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12], Palumbo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]) we use the OpenCV 3.0 library and the QtCreator5.2 developing platform. With this STAR protocol, we publish the source code to implement the Object class “Tracker”, which would allow you to create instances of “trackers” and allocate each of them in a different thread, if you go for a multi-threaded approach. The only step you will have to implement is the image collection from a camera of your choice and send them to the object for processing. Once processed, the object “tracker” will return the detected position of the animals together with its size. For further details see documentations for source code, header and instruction on how to implement it in your code: https://github.com/fabrizio-palumbo/Conditioned-behaviour-in-juvenile-zebrafish[href=https://github.com/fabrizio-palumbo/Conditioned-behaviour-in-juvenile-zebrafish].\nImplementation. We use a class of algorithm called “Adaptive Background Gaussian Mixture Model for foreground segmentation” (KaewTraKulPong and Bowden, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11], Lech et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16], Zivkovic, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28], Power and Schoonees, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]).\nThe principle behind this algorithm is the following: the intensity value of each pixel in the image is modeled by an adaptive parametric mixture model of N, typically three or five, Gaussian distributions (KaewTraKulPong and Bowden, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11], Power and Schoonees, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). Once the image has been modeled, the posterior probability is estimated, to define the current state of the pixel: background or foreground (Power and Schoonees, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]).\nThe implementation of this algorithm is described more in detail in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and in attached documentation,https://github.com/fabrizio-palumbo/Conditioned-behaviour-in-juvenile-zebrafish[href=https://github.com/fabrizio-palumbo/Conditioned-behaviour-in-juvenile-zebrafish]. Once the pixels corresponding to the juvenile zebrafish are identified their center of mass defines the animal’s coordinates in the arena (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1C). As a quality control of the detected fish, two criteria must be satisfied by the area detected:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/591-Fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Image processing flow chart to detect juvenile zebrafish in low contrast images\n(A) Pixels corresponding to the zebrafish are detected by the tracking algorithm.\n(B) Dilations and erosion operations are performed to reduce the noise in the background pixels.\n(C) Coordinates of the biggest area detected, which match the animal size range defined by the user, are extracted and processed by the software.\n(D) Example of two min raw trace of fish position superimposed on the raw image detected by the camera. Dashed white lines shows 2 min of detected fish position, recorded at 15 frames per second.\nThe size of the detected zebrafish must be within a physiological range for the developmental stage of the analyzed fish (1–2 week=2–4 mm2, 3–4 weeks= 4–10 mm2).\nThe distance between the detected animal position in two consecutive frames must be smaller than a threshold defined by the physiological maximum velocity for the zebrafish. We use 3 cm displacement between two frames, corresponding to 66 ms, to avoid noise detection from the distant borders of the arena.\nThe result of our tracking algorithm has proven to be very stable and reliable even in conditions of weak contrast between the fish and the surrounding environment (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1C), compared to a background subtraction algorithm in our assay. In our CPA training assay, image acquisition frequency of 15 Hz was sufficient to accurately track the fish without computationally overload the software. An example two minutes’ pathway for one juvenile is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D.",
    "Alternative: The approach we follow to implement our behavioral software is only one of the possible solutions. It is worth to mention the recent sotfware package, Stytra (https://github.com/portugueslab/stytra[href=https://github.com/portugueslab/stytra]), published by Portugues lab (Štih et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]). This software package provides a platform which will allow the experimenter to perform many different behavioral protocols, requiring little programming knowledge by the user thanks to a user-friendly interface and documentation.\nHardware. To implement the behavioral setup there are specific design requirements that are important to maximize animal welfare and minimize external influence during the experiment. We implemented a setup design, shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], which fulfills the following requirements:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/591-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic representation of the behavioral setup that is used for conditioned place avoidance\nSix square shaped petri dishes are placed on an LCD screen that display specific visual patterns from the bottom. A high-resolution camera, Manta 235B (Allied Vision) with a wide-angle objective, is used to acquire images of the animals. A custom-made software is used to acquired and process the images in real time. Depending on the protocol that is performed, the software communicates with an Arduino Due that controls 6 separate non-inverting amplifier Opamp circuit for delivering the mildly aversive electric stimulation only when animals are detected in the conditioned zone. Each arena is equipped with two tungsten wires, covering the entire length of it two opposing sides. Figure adapted with permission from (Palumbo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19])\nPrevent light\\sound contamination from the surrounding environment as good as possible.\nPrevent visual contact between the animals in different chambers during the behavioral testing.\nThe water temperature should be maintained constant and never below 25°C/26°C. We used a heater in the room to buffer temperature fluctuations.\nPrevent any intervention by the experimenter during the entire protocol.",
    "Behavioral arena. To construct the behavioral arena using standard components, we recommend Gosselin square shaped Petri dishes (120 mm × 120 mm × 15.8 mm). The walls of each arena were covered with standard white opaque electric tape to avoid any interaction between the fish in neighboring chambers. This is particularly important, since the juvenile zebrafish exhibit social interactions (Dreosti et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7], Tunbak et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24], Groneberg et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8], Hinz and de Polavieja, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Using these large petri dishes allows the animal to explore the arena freely without any restrictions and increase the richness of the behavioral repertoire. These small details play a crucial role on the resulting behavior since we are not constraining animal movement and enhance flexibility. Finally, using square shaped petri dishes allows easier implementation of the electrodes for establishing a uniform electric field.\nElectrodes. We recommend the use of inert tungsten wire electrodes, 12 cm of length and 0.25 mm of diameter, for delivering mild aversive electric stimulation to the fish. We observed that tungsten electrodes were better than silver electrodes which showed toxic effects in water. However, tungsten wires exhibit fast decay in conductivity due to the accumulation of ions over one of the electrodes, generating a coating layer within few seconds under constant voltage. To avoid coating and establish constant current, we use 10 milliseconds long 1.2 mA current pulses at 1.33 Hz repetition rate and alternate the polarity on the electrodes between conditioning sessions. All these additional measures prevent oxidation of tungsten wires throughout 2–3 h long behavioral training sessions. This allows us to reuse the same electrodes across experiments extending their lifetime indefinitely (we have used the same electrodes for 4 years now and they still work well). (See problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] for troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])",
    "Electric stimulation circuit. To deliver mildly aversive electric stimuli separately to individual fish, we used an Arduino Due based circuit. Arduino board received 3,3 V digital input from the tracking software, when the zebrafish is detected in the condition zone, during conditioning period, and delivered 18 V (10 millisecond, 1.2 mA current at 1.33 Hz) to each fish separately. For each fish, a separate integrated circuit was built and used, connecting an Operational-Amplifier (Opamp, TLE2142 EXCALIBUR low-noise high-speed precision, Texas Instrument) in a non-inverted amplified configuration. The Voltage at the output is given by the relation (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]):\n  Voltage output = Voltage input   (  1 +   R e s i s t a n c e  2   R e s i s t a n c e  1    )   \nVisual stimuli presentation. Visual stimuli are presented to the fish form the bottom using a horizontally positioned LCD monitor. The LCD monitor gives the flexibility to change the visual stimuli, to control its timing, and to synchronize with other electronic systems.\nWe use a simple visual pattern dividing the arena half in red and half in gray colors. We match the luminosity of colored illumination, when choosing the red and gray patterns marking different compartment of the arena. This is important since zebrafish respond differently to different illumination and ambient light levels (Spence and Smith, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22], Avdesh et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], Oliveira et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18], Guggiana-Nilo and Engert, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9], Cheng et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], Cheng et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).\nNote: It is very important to keep the water in the behavioral chambers warm, which is crucial especially for extended behavioral testing.\nTo ensure that the water in each behavioral arena never drops below 26°C:\nMeasure the water temperature in each arena before and after performing a behavioral experiment.",
    "Perform the behavioral experiments in a heated room. We installed a passive heater element in our behavioral room which helps to keep the room temperature around 26°C over time.\nExperimental design. When designing behavioral experiments, the first rule you need to have in mind is “minimize animals’ discomfort, while maximizing animal welfare and scientific rigor of the experimental output.” To do so it is very important that you tune all the parameters of your behavioral protocol with this goal in mind.\nThe stimulus design is a critical step when building a conditioned place avoidance task. We chose the minimum stimulus intensity that elicits a brief escape response. We therefore recommend minimizing the intensity and the duration of the aversive electric stimuli to maximize animals’ welfare and consequently their performance.\nThe duration of each training and test session of the CPA protocol is another important parameter to optimize.\nAdditionally, we recommend verifying the CPA learning results by flipping the color assignment of the conditioned zone from red to gray, in separate CPA experiments.\nWe recommend our CPA protocols below.\nBehavioral training\nTiming: varies, 5h for steps 9–10, 4 days for step 11\nSingle day CPA training. For single day CPA training, we recommend the experimental design in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. Also keep in mind:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/591-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic description of the protocol recommended for one day training in juvenile zebrafish",
    "Baseline is 60 min long; conditioning and test sessions are 30 min long with no delay in between sessions. During the conditioning session, mildly aversive electric stimuli are delivered at 1.33hz, every time the animal enters the conditioned zone (red). We recommend verifying the CPA learning results by filliping the color assignment of the conditioned zone from red to gray, in separate CPA experiments. Figure adapted with permission from (Palumbo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nEstablish a long enough baseline session to ensure that the animals are relaxed and habituated to the environment, evenly exploring the arena without bias. We choose to have a baseline session of 1 h. This will give you the opportunity to evaluate possible innate preference of the animal for any of the arena parameters (location, pattern displayed, etc.). If a naïve animal displays a clear preference for specific compartment of the arena after a long baseline session, it might be necessary to adjust the visual patterns to reduce such bias. We suggest to always maintain a homogeneous luminosity all over the arena (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Example video of baseline exploration of the arena by a 3-week-old juvenile zebrafish, related to steps 9–11\nExample video recording of animal behavior for 5 min (speed-up 5×) of the baseline session of a three weeks old juvenile zebrafish. The explored path is marked by white dots. Please note that the animal does not exhibits neither freezing behavior neither erratic swimming. Arena dimensions are 12 cm × 12 cm. Example video from (Palumbo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nMinimize the duration of the conditioning sessions, as much as possible. This will reduce the discomfort of the animal, substantially. We recommend performing multiple short conditioning sessions, separated by test sessions.",
    "Administrate the negative stimulus to the animal (1.2 mA for 10 ms at 1.33 Hz) every time the animal enters the conditioned zone.\nTerminate stimulus administration as soon as the animal exits the conditioned zone.\nWe recommend two 30 min conditioning sessions and two 30 min test sessions. Together with a 1-h long baseline session, the experiment will last around 3 h, which has no negative impact on animals’ health and welfare, as we show in our previous publication (Palumbo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nWe do not recommend protocols longer than 5 h (the longest duration we have tested). This might have a negative impact on animals’ health since they will not be fed for a long time and the water is not changed during the training.\nNote: In our study (Palumbo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]), we do not observe freezing behavior or anxiety-like phenotype in animal trained in 1 day protocols up to 5 h long. We therefore recommend to keeping any behavioral protocol shorter than 5 h.\nNote: We do recommend collecting the animal from the facility only when the behavioral protocol is ready to begin. This will allow the experimenter to transport the animal to the experimental area and to initiate the behavioral training immediately. This will minimize the total time the animal is handled outside the facility.",
    "Sham-training experiments. In our recent study focusing on CPA learning in juvenile zebrafish (Palumbo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]), we proposed a sham-training protocol to distinguish the effects of animals’ aversive experience due to mildly aversive electric stimulation (US), from the CPA learning related adaptations of animal behavior, as described in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A. This sham training protocol decouples animals’ spatial position in the arena from animals’ subjective experiences in response to the delivery of electric stimuli (US). This allows us to compare the behaviors of CPA trained animals with sham-trained animals with same subjective experience of the US. To do so:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/591-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Schematic description of the Sham experiment in juvenile zebrafish\n(A) Schematic description of the protocol recommended for one day training in juvenile zebrafish. Baseline is 60 min long; conditioning and test sessions are 30 min long with no delay in between sessions.\n(B) Hardware configuration of the behavioral setup to perform sham training. Each trained animal is coupled, via direct hardwiring, to another animal which will be sham trained. During the conditioning session, mildly aversive electric stimuli are delivered at 1.33hz to both animals simultaneously, every time the trained animal enters the conditioned zone (red). We recommend verifying the CPA learning results by filliping the color assignment of the conditioned zone from red to gray, in separate CPA experiments. Figure adapted with permission from (Palumbo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nAssign, for each animal which undergoes a training session, a sibling animal as a sham-control. Animals will undergo the training session in couples, one trained and one sham-trained.\nThe two arenas need to be identical. We also recommend alternating the arena used for training with the arena used for sham-training, in different sessions. This will control for any asymmetry in the arena of which the experimenter is not aware of.",
    "Connect both arenas to the same stimulation cable, the one controlled by the trained fish (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Doing so, both animals will be exposed to the same stimulation, controlled exclusively by the trained fish.\nPerform a new series of sham-training experiment any time a new training protocol is implemented.\nMulti-day CPA training. In our recent study, we showed that long term training of juvenile zebrafish leads to better CPA learning performance and memory recall (Palumbo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). Such long-term training is best achieved by multiple training sessions spread over consecutive days. This allows the animal to rest, feed and recover between training days. Training juvenile zebrafish over multiple days requires the experimenter to plan animal husbandry and handling accordingly. For multi-day CPA training, we recommend the experimental design in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. Also, keep in mind:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/591-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Schematic description of the protocol recommended for multi-day training in juvenile zebrafish\nBaseline and blank sessions are 60 min long, recall, conditioning and test sessions are 30 min long with no delay in between sessions. During the conditioning session, mildly aversive electric stimuli are delivered at 1.33hz, every time the animal enters the conditioned zone (red). Each day is concluded with a conditioning session to avoid memory extinction overnight. From day two, each protocol starts with a blank session during which the animals are habituated to the arena without any pattern presented. Figure adapted with permission from (Palumbo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).",
    "Minimize the amount of time for transferring animals between behavioral chambers and temporary holding between training days. After the first training day, we keep individual juvenile zebrafish in petri-dishes (90 mm radius) in a 28°C incubator from the end of the behavioral training (circa 5:00 pm) until the next day training session (circa 10:00 am) We feed the fish before placing them in the incubator. The next morning, we refresh the water and we feed the animals 30 min before the start of the new training session.\nWe recommend, before performing a 30 min recall session, to begin each additional day of training with a 30 min habituation session without any visual pattern presented to the animal. This will allow the animal to habituate to the behavioral arena without eliciting any memory recall related to the training visual stimuli, since they are not displayed. The arena is illuminated with light gray, of the same luminosity of the pattern used on day1, see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] for a graphical representation.\nWe recommend concluding each training day with a conditioning session (but not a test session), as it might help promote memory consolidation.\nWash each behavioral chamber thoroughly with RO water, before and after each training day.\nBehavioral analysis\nTiming: varies, up to 15–30 min to adapt and run the codes we provide\nFor designing the analysis pipeline, we recommend using multiple complementary CPA learning measures, some of which are also used in previous studies (Palumbo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19], Valente et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25], Millot et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17], Yashina et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27], Kermen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). This approach allows quantification of animal behavior from different perspectives with different strengths and weaknesses.\nWe suggest quantifying the following parameters to assess CPA learning:\nAverage density of zebrafish position in the CPA arena.",
    "Relative time spent in the conditioned zone.\nRelative swimming distance in the conditioned zone.\nAnimals’ distance from the boundary between safe and conditioned zones.\nConditioned Place Avoidance learning index (Palumbo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nSwim direction near the boundary between safe and conditioned zone.\nAvoidance of entry to conditioned zone, near the boundary between safe and conditioned zones.\nWe suggest quantifying following parameters to assess animals state and health:\nSwim velocity during the experiment.\nPercentage of time that the zebrafish exhibit no swimming (freezing), which we defined as less than 2 mm swimming for 2 s (adapted from (Agetsuma et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1])).\nSwim velocity, one second before (b) and after (a) the delivery of aversive unconditioned stimuli (US).\nNote: To see the implementation of these measures, please refer to the documentation in https://github.com/fabrizio-palumbo/Conditioned-behaviour-in-juvenile-zebrafish[href=https://github.com/fabrizio-palumbo/Conditioned-behaviour-in-juvenile-zebrafish] and in our earlier study (Palumbo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nNote: In order to have a complete and complementary overview of animal health and performance, we highlight the importance of using multiple metrics while evaluating animal behavior.\nChemogenetic ablation of specific neural populations in zebrafish brain\nTiming: 44 h\nThis protocol describes the use of a transgenic zebrafish line Tg(narp:GAL4VP16; UAS-E1b:NTR-mCherry) to ablate dorsolateral habenula (dlHb) neurons. This transgenic line expresses Nitroreductase (NTR) fusion protein tagged by a mCherry specifically in dlHb (Agetsuma et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]) (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]). As shown before in adult zebrafish (Agetsuma et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), bath application of Metronidazole (MTZ) chemogenetically ablate NTR positive dlHb neurons in juvenile zebrafish (Palumbo et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nPrepare MTZ solution\nNeeded: 50 mL tubes, petri dishes (50 mL), aluminum foil, microbalance, vortex, and shaker (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resource-table]), incubator (± 28°C).",
    "Prepare 50 mL [10 mM] MTZ solution in a 50 mL tube. Fill the 50 mL tube with AFW and add DMSO, subsequently add the MTZ powder. Proportion is described in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_591_1.csv\nSpecification about the chemicals can be found in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resource-table].\nGiven the photodegradable nature of the resulting MTZ solution, wrap the entire 50 mL tube, once securely locked, into aluminum foil and make sure that no light comes into contact with the solution. Pay particular attention to this step.\nCritical: MTZ is photodegradable. Prepare a fresh batch of MTZ solution for each ablation protocol. 2 × 50 mL is needed for treating control and experimental groups simultaneously.\nCritical: We recommend leaving the animal for at least 12h (overnight) in fish water after removing them from the MTZ bath to allow the MTZ to wash out. During this time, frequently refresh the water in the petri dish and feed the animal.\nCritical: Perform the behavioral experiments as soon as the MTZ washout is completed, before any neurogenesis that might occur over the course of the next few days.\nCritical: As control animals, we recommend using sibling zebrafish that do not express the UAS-E1b:NTR-mCherry transgene.\nShake by hand, vortex thoroughly, and leave the tube on a shaker for at least 30 min, allowing the metronidazole to dissolve properly.\nChemogenetic ablation\nBefore you start treating the animals make sure you have:\n2× 50 mL [10 mM] MTZ solution\nAluminum foil\nFish already in the experimental area and fed prior to the treatment.\nIncubator at ± 28°C.\n1 petri dish must contain at most 3 juvenile zebrafish.",
    "Prepare the fish ready for the experiment. Make sure that the fish had access to food before the start of the ablation protocol. Limit the number of fish (max 3) per dish, to avoid mortality due to hypoxia or excessive ammonia. Make sure that the animals to be treated are size matched.\nFill two petri dishes with 50 mL [10 mM] each, and make sure the temperature of the solution is not lower than 26°C\nTransfer the zebrafish, one at a time in the petri dishes with the MTZ solution, using a 7 mL pipette. Make sure to cut the tip of the pipette, as described earlier. To prevent reduction of MTZ concentration in the petri dish, transfer the fish in a small bubble of water.\nCritical: We observed that the lower MTZ concentrations (1 and 5 mM) did not yield desired effects in juvenile zebrafish. Moreover 10 mM MTZ solution did not elicit any toxicity or alteration of animal behavior in control animals of nacre or Ab wild-type genetic background.\nLabel the petri dish with necessary information (fish line, date, experimental group, experimenters initial, etc.)\nMetronidazole is light-sensitive, therefore wrap the dish in aluminum foil.

    "After 24 h, transfer the fish to a new petri dish containing clean fish water. Make sure to refresh the water twice in each petri dish in the first few hours after the MTZ treatment.\nIncubate again (± 28°C) for 12 h in AFW. Make sure to feed the animal before incubating.\nThe next morning make sure to refresh the fish water in each petri dish and feed the animal at least 30 min before the start of the behavioral protocol.\nThe fish are now ready for the behavior protocol. Ideally start between 9 and 12 am, to keep consistency for the timing of the experiments, and animals’ circadian rhythm.\nValidation of chemogenetic ablation (Timing: 16 h) To verify successful chemogenetic ablation of neurons we recommend TUNEL assay (Agetsuma et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). The protocol was adapted from the manufacturer’s protocol (In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, Fluorescein, 11684795910 Roche) and optimized for whole mount labeling and confocal imaging (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nEuthanize fish in ice cold water and fix it in cooled 4% PFA in 0.25% PBTx (0.25% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) for 12 h at 4°C.\nPermeabilize samples in 0.050% Trypsin-EDTA on ice for 40 min and wash 3 times with 0.25% PBTx.\nIncubate the samples in 50μL TUNEL reaction mix for 1 h at 37°C humidified atmosphere, in a water bath covered by aluminum foil the dark. Subsequently wash it in 0.25% PBTx.\nPlace the samples on microscopy slides after washing steps in increasing glycerol concentration of 25%, 50%, and 75%. Then, use 75% Glycerol as a medium for mounting the samples on glass slides for confocal imaging (see problems 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).",
    "The TUNEL assay is based on detection of apoptotic cells. Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death and can be affected by numerous factors (e.g., uptake of the drug, passage through the blood brain barrier, concentration, etc.). To visualize the ablated cells at different apoptotic stages, we performed TUNEL assay at 16 h (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6C) and 24 h (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B) after the start of the MTZ treatment.

    "Note: Zebrafish brain have exceptional regenerative capacity (Celikkaya et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Kizil, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Cosacak et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Lange et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Kesavan et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Schwarzer et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). Therefore, we recommend that the behavioral testing is done no longer than 2 days after the chemogenetic ablation, otherwise neuroregeneration may affect subsequent experiments. We observed addition of new habenular neurons in juvenile zebrafish, already 2 days after chemogenetic ablation (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]; Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2.
