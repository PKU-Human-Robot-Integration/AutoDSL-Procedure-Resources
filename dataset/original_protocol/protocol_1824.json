Transfected cells will then be used in the next major step.\nTrypsinize, count and plate 200,000 HeLa cells per well onto 6-well plates or 3.5 cm Petri dishes in cell culture medium.\nIf cells do not grow at same pace (e.g., in the comparison between wild type and knockout cells), an optimization will be needed for the ideal number of cells to be plated for each cell line.\nFrom 18 to 24 h after plating, transfect cells using ∼ 1 μg plasmid DNA and 2–3 μL Lipofectamine 2000 (both diluted in OptiMEM to a final volume of 500 μL).\nFrom 18 to 24 h after transfection, trypsinize, count and plate 100,000 transfected cells onto glass-bottom 3.5 cm Petri dishes (to aid cell adhesion, coating with poly-D-lysine or laminin could be applied if necessary).\nAlternatives: To avoid having to trypsinizing cells twice and save time, cells can be plated and transfected directly onto glass-bottom Petri dishes. If this alternative is used, number of cells to be plated and transfection protocol should be optimized. For optimal cell imaging, allow cells to express GFP-tagged proteins for at least 36–48 h after transfection.\nNote: For these experiments, we used homemade Petri dishes with glass bottom, by drilling the bottom of a commercial dish, gluing a glass coverslip using a non-toxic silicone, and sterilizing with UV light for at least 30 min. We also performed this experiment using Petri dishes already containing a glass bottom, which are commercially available (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).",
    "Alternatives: Chambered slides can also be used (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), but these should have a glass bottom and the optical characteristics required for confocal imaging. Transfected cells attached to a loose coverslip can also be used coupled to an Attofluor® cell chamber (Invitrogen, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nClassical laser microirradiation experiment\nTiming: 60–120 min\nTransfected cells expressing fluorescent-tagged proteins are microirradiated and the protein recruitment to DNA damage sites is assessed in a time- and site-specific manner.\nThe day after plating the transfected cells onto glass-bottom Petri dishes, prepare cell culture medium for microirradiation (see recipe in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).\nAdd 0.5 μg of Hoechst per milliliter of culture medium (1:2000 dilution from the stock described above).\nRemove the medium from the Petri dish and add 2 mL of phenol-red free medium containing Hoechst.\nNote: Cell should be sensitized with Hoechst for 30 min prior to the initiation of the laser microirradiation in the microscope chamber at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nNote: For setting this protocol, we used a Nikon Eclipse Ti A1-A confocal microscope and the acquisition software NIS-Elements. Screenshots of the steps to be followed are shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. Settings could vary in different devices or software.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1416-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Walkthrough of the NIS-Elements software for guidance\n(A) select “ROI” and draw seven square ROIs and three rectangular ones.\n(B) Right click the rectangular ROIs and set them to “Bleaching ROIs”. Adjust their size, bleaching ROIs height should be set to 5 pixels.\n(C) in “Acquisition”, select the desired brightness. In “Scan setting”, set “Scan Size” to 512 × 512-pixels or 1024 × 1024-pixels, “Scan speed” to fast, “Count” to 2 and “Zoom” to 5.",
    "(D) Near the acquisition tab, click the “Photo Activation/Bleaching” tab and select the 405 nm laser, setting its power to 5–25%. Select “Keep HV” as “HV mode during stimulation” and “Scan Speed” to 4 s per frame (pixel dwell 12.4 μs).\n(E) Select “Applications” and “ND stimulation”.\n(F) In the “ND stimulation” tab, define three phases, one Acquisition (3 loops, to take three baseline images), one Stimulation (select all stimulation ROIs, only 1 loop), and another Acquisition (select the number of images to be taken and the interval between them; in this example, 180 images are taken within 3 min, which means one image per second). Still in this window, select \"Perform Time Measurement\" and “Apply Stimulation Settings” and click \"Run now\".\n(G) the “Time Measurement” tab will open and display the ROIs mean fluorescence. Once the irradiation is finished, save the file, and click export to and Excel table.\nWhile cells are being sensitized inside the microscope chamber, turn on the confocal microscope, the 405 nm laser (which in our microscope has a total power output of 405.7 mW) and the acquisition software.\nCritical: To avoid oxidative damage, cells should be maintained in a humidified chamber at 37°C and 5% CO2 (for 0.6 L/min of air flow, set 0.03 L/min of CO2 flow). Although not mandatory, the medium containing Hoechst can be removed and changed with fresh phenol red-free medium 30 min after sensitization to avoid excessive sensitization.\nAs shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], each experiment comprises the sequential irradiation of three cells.\nGo to the live imaging screen.\nAdd 3 rectangular Regions of Interest (ROIs).\nAdd 7 square ROIs.\nSet the rectangular ones as “Bleaching ROIs”, which should be 5 pixels in height and variable length.",
    "Six of the square ROIs are used for bleaching control of imaging overtime, and one is used as the background control. Their size can be variable, depending on the cell size and space between them. Avoid placing a ROI over nucleoli or intense GFP granules.\nWe used a 60× objective (numerical aperture of 1.4, oil objective) with 5× digital zoom.\nSet image resolution to 512 × 512-pixels (lower resolution), if assessing one picture per second, or 1024 × 1024-pixels (higher resolution), if assessing less timepoints (ex. one picture every 30 s).\nSet scan speed to Fast: 2 frame/s (pixel dwell 0.7 μs) for 512 × 512-pixels images or 0.5 frames/s (pixel dwell 1.1 μs) for 1024 × 1024-pixels images.\nSet count to 2 (line average of two images is performed for each timepoint).\nGo to “Photo Activation/Bleaching” page.\nSelect only the 405 nm laser, setting 5%–25% as the laser power (power 20.3–101.4 mW).\nSelect Keep HV as the HV mode during stimulation and HV linear correction.\nSelect the same settings for the other stimulation area in case multiple cells are to be irradiated at once.\nStill on that page, set scan speed to 4 s per frame (pixel dwell 12.4 μs).\nNote: The “HV Linear Correction” is used to avoid the steep gain variation that occurs beyond a certain HV point; this function corrects the gain variation to the same rate as the HV adjustment. The “HV mode during stimulation” dictates whether the detector gain should be set to zero during the stimulation phase to avoid detector overload. By choosing “Keep HV” as the HV mode during stimulation, a stable gain will be assured in the subsequent acquisition phase, as the detector gain could drift if turned off and on again.",
    "Critical: The laser power will affect the amount and type of DNA damage caused. This value should be optimized by the user, by observing the recruitment of control proteins and/or fixing cells and doing immunofluorescence control for γH2AX.\nOpen the ND setup window and set the experiment to have 3 phases: acquisition (pre-irradiation), stimulation (irradiation) and acquisition (post-irradiation).\nSet the first acquisition to three and the stimulation to one, whereas the second acquisition phase is variable, depending on how long the acquisition should be, and whether photos are to be taken every second or with which interval.\nNote: The number of images taken after irradiation and interval between them will define the total time of acquisition. For apical proteins (e.g. KU80), we acquire images for 3 min (one photo per second), for other proteins (e.g. FUS) we use 5 min (one photo every 30 s) and for downstream/effector proteins (e.g. 53BP1) we use 15 min acquisition (one photo every minute). Longer acquisitions may result in cells moving [see troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]].\nOnce all ROIs are in place, click “Apply Stimulation Settings”, click “Run now” and wait the end of the acquisition. No photos will be taken during the irradiation phase, which should take approximately 4 s for a single cell irradiation and 12 s for 3 cells irradiation (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] for an example and Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] for troubleshooting).",
    "Critical: Cell should be sensitized with Hoechst for 30 min prior to the initiation of the laser microirradiation experiment and can be used until approximately 60 min from the addition of Hoechst. Each Petri dish can be used for 5–6 aquisitions, if using a 3 min protocol. If several cells need to be acquired, we recommend plating more Petri dishes. Use the same laser power across different replicates of each experiment.\nNote: In our microscope setting, we can define up to three “Bleaching ROIs”. However, the irradiation is sequential, that is, the irradiation takes place in one cell at a time. For proteins that are recruited at later time points, this is not a problem, but for proteins that are recruited very early, i.e., within a few seconds from irradiation, it would be better to select just one “Bleaching ROI” and irradiate only one cell at a time.\nAfter finishing the acquisition, perform “Time measurement” (this can also be done simultaneously with the acquisition), export data and proceed to data analysis.\nNote: To demonstrate that the laser microirradiation protocol successfully induced the formation of DSBs, some Petri dishes containing irradiated cells should be fixed with 4% PFA immediately after irradiation. Cells should then be stained for γH2AX or another DNA damage marker (such as pATM, etc) using a standardized immunofluorescence protocol. As mounting is not possible, we recommend that cells should be imaged immediately after staining. If this is not possible, dishes can be filled with PBS to make sure cells do not dry out and kept in fridge covered with aluminum foil for the shortest period of time.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Representative video of a microirradiation experiment showing all ROIs in one single cell, related to step 9",
    "HeLa cell transfected with FUS-GFP is displayed. The irradiation ROI is stimulated by the 405 nm laser, inducing the formation of DNA damage. The control ROIs are used as a reference for the natural bleaching due to subsequent imaging. The background ROI is used to exclude any background fluorescence. The fluorescence in each ROI pre- and post-irradiation is used for the data analysis described in the protocol above. The video shows an experiment comprised of 183 micrographs (3 pre- and 180 post-microirradiation) taken one per second. Each second of the video contains 10 sequential micrographs. Scale: 5 μm. Playback was adjusted to 30 frames/s.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S2. A cell moves upon microirradiation, related to step 9 and an example of problem 2 (troubleshooting)\nHeLa cells transfected with FUS-GFP were microirradiated. The indicated cell moves (rotates) upon microirradiation and should be excluded from the experiment. The video shows an experiment comprised of 45 micrographs (3 pre- and 42 post-microirradiation) taken one each 15 s for a total of 10 min. Each second of the video contains 5 sequential micrographs. Scale: 20 μm. Playback was adjusted to 30 frames/s.\nLaser microirradiation as a tool to investigate the role of liquid-liquid phase separation in DNA damage repair",
    "To study whether the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is necessary for the recruitment of DNA damage factors, we have used compounds that perturb LLPS, 1,6-Hexanediol (1,6-HD) and Ammonium acetate (Am. Ac.). 1,6-HD is an aliphatic alcohol that dissolves various cytoplasmic and nuclear membraneless compartments in vivo by disrupting hydrophobic interactions (Allodi et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Kroschwald et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Updike et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]; Yamazaki et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]), and partially dissolves FUS polymers in vitro (Allodi et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Kato and McKnight, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). 2,5-Hexanediol (2,5-HD) is a less hydrophobic isomer of 1,6-HD that does not affect LLPS (Allodi et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]; Kato and McKnight, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]), and can thus be used as a negative control. Am. Ac. is a hygroscopic salt that inhibits RNA-protein gelation without perturbing intracellular pH (Hamaguchi et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]; Jain and Vale, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20])ì. It leads to the disappearance of nuclear CAG-repeat RNA foci and ribonucleoprotein bodies that depend on ionic interactions (Jain and Vale, 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]), and was recently shown to rapidly dissolve 53BP1 foci (Pessina et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Additionally, bis-ANS is a small molecule that was recently shown to promote a biphasic control of phase separation, while low concentrations strongly promote LLPS, higher concentrations disrupt liquid droplets (Babinchak et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), and can thus be tested as a potential drug to be used in microirradiation experiments.",
    "To perform a laser microirradiation experiment in the presence of these drugs that interfere with LLPS, simply add the drugs together with Hoechst in step 4 from the previous protocol. Specifically, remove the medium from the Petri dish and add 2 mL of phenol-red free medium containing both the treatment of choice, and Hoechst. For the aliphatic alcohols, a 2% concentration is enough to disrupt phase separation, but mild enough to allow HeLa cells to recover after its withdrawal (Levone et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). For ammonium acetate, both 50 or 100 mM can be used; while 50 mM cause a mild effect in LLPS in HeLa cells, 100 mM is stronger, but may also compromise cell health in certain cell lines. Although little has been described regarding the use of the small molecule bis-ANS, Babinchak and collaborators described that high concentration disrupt phase separation in vitro (Babinchak et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). If using bis-ANS, note that it is a fluorescent molecule (detected between 410 and 490 nm wavelengths).\nNote: To demonstrate that the specific drug concentrations are enough to disrupt LLPS, a validation by immunofluorescence is necessary."
