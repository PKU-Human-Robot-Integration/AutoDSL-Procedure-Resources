    "The present protocol follows the guidelines of the Ethics of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine. Informed consent was obtained from the patient for this article and the video.\n1. Patient Selection\nEnsure patients have PDAC in the pancreas neck, body, and tail as confirmed by contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT). This procedure is indicated in the following cases: resectable pancreatic cancer and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer after neoadjuvant treatment. The possibility of radical resection increases when the tumor regresses markedly following effective neoadjuvant treatment.\n\tNOTE: In the presented case, CT imaging revealed a tumor in the neck of the patient's pancreas, which was most likely cancerous.\nDo not perform this surgery in the following conditions: (1) metastatic PDAC; (2) overall poor patient health, in which the body is unable to withstand major surgery; (3) if a pancreatic tumor is present that infiltrates the splenic vein or the main blood arteries other than the splenic artery.\nAt the early age of the learning curve, do not choose challenging cases, for example: obese patients with a body max index (BMI) >35 kg/m2; patients who have suffered from recurrent pancreatitis, as they might have a very poor pancreas parenchyma condition; patients undergoing pancreas targeted radiotherapy; patients with former laparotomy, etc. Once extensive experience with laparoscopic surgery has been obtained, patients with these conditions can also be selected15.\n2. Surgical technique\nOperative setting\n\t\nPlace the anesthetized patient on the operation table in a supine position. Ensure the legs are spread apart.",
    "During the sterile operation, expose the suprapubic region sufficiently for specimen extraction by the Pfannenstiel incision. Make sure the first surgeon is on the right side of the patient, the first assistant is on the left side, and the second assistant with the laparoscope is between the patient's legs. This procedure employs a five-port technique, as shown in Figure 1.\nAfter establishing pneumoperitoneum, insert a 12 mm trocar below the navel. Securely install the next four trocars on the abdominal wall in a semicircular arrangement mode with the help of the laparoscopic visual field.\nExploration phase\n\t\nPerform routine diagnostic laparoscopy from the start to examine the liver and the peritoneal surfaces for extra pancreatic metastasis.\nOpen the lesser sac using an ultrasound knife by dividing the gastrocolic ligament approximately 2 cm distal from the gastroepiploic artery and vein.\nDissect and resect the short gastric vessels to facilitate splenectomy.\n\t\tNOTE: The most superior short gastric vessels can also be detected at this stage for better bleeding control.\nSuspend the stomach above the surface of the pancreas with a liver retractor to create enough room for operative procedures around the suprapancreatic area.\nIsolate and excise the splenocolic and perisplenic ligaments with an ultrasound knife, to further expose the splenic flexure of the colon and the tail of the pancreas.\n\t\tNOTE: Use intraoperative ultrasonography when local structures are not clearly identified. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma appears at intraoperative ultrasonography (US) as a hypoechoic mass with ill-defined margins.\nDivide and pass through the gap between the posterior surface of the pancreatic neck and the junction part of the SMV, portal vein (PV), and splenic vein. Then carefully clear this area to prepare for pancreatic transection.\nDissection phase",
    "Determine the dorsal resection plane, including the dorsal side of the SMA, the dorsal side of the pancreatic head, the root of the CeA, the ventral side of the left renal artery vessels, and the renal hilum.\nElevate the transverse colon and its mesentery first on the dorsal side of the pancreatic head. Perform the Kocher maneuver to expose the anterior surface of the left renal vein (LRV).\n\t\tNOTE: A view of several centimeters of the LRV at this point are helpful for the later procedure steps, when the LRV can be handled on the other side. Explore the group 16 lymph node (para-aortic nodes).\nPlace the entire small bowel on the right side to provide access to the dorsal side of the SMA. Identify the SMA above the LRV, then dissect it along its periadventitial plane on the anterior-left margin and separate it from the pancreas16.\nPerform the approach on the ventral side of the renal artery vessels and renal hilum as described in step 2.3.5.\nPerform the resection range to the left and posterior plane behind the adrenal gland and onto the surface of the left kidney in the posterior RAMPS.\n\t\tNOTE: On the left side of the aorta, the left renal artery is followed.\nFollow steps 2.3.7-2.3.10 to get to the core of the CeA method.\nReturn to the upper colon region. Anatomize the common hepatic artery and gastroduodenal artery (GDA), and then identify the correct hepatic artery.\nDissect the gastroduodenal lymph nodes, especially the eighth group of lymph nodes17.\nMove the GDA to the right side using a rubber band to expose the anterior surface of the PV.",
    "Expose the root of the CeA. To do so, dissect the common hepatic artery to its origin, and dissect the CeA free at its origin from the abdominal aorta.\nDissect around the SMA and CeA from the caudal side to the cephalic side. For this approach, follow steps 2.3.12-2.3.14.\nDissect the SMA along its periadventitial plane on the anterior-left margin.\n\t\tNOTE: The anterior surface of the SMA is well displayed under the tunnel which was previously created below the pancreatic neck. The dorsal pancreatic artery is an arterial branching to the pancreas, which will be explored from the root of the SMA.\nDivide the distal pancreas from the retroperitoneum and then manage the inferior mesenteric vein (IMV).\n\t\tNOTE: As a benefit of using the dorsal-caudal artery approach technique, create anatomical space between the SMA and pancreas. Until now, bleeding control of the SMA can be easily achieved, as the most of the space at the left side of the SMA is already exposed.\nAfter excluding tumor infiltration of the anterior surface of the SMA, the SMV is exposed under the pancreatic neck.\n\t\tNOTE: Exclude tumor infiltration on the anterior surface of the SMA, due to the fact that the vascular plexus and the nerve plexus surrounding the SMA can be completely severed during operation.\nAccording to the pancreatic thickness and texture at the pancreatic neck, transect the pancreas parenchyma using a mechanical stapler device with a corresponding cartridge18,19. Suture the pancreatic duct with a 5-0 polypropylene suture. Perform frozen pathologic examination of the pancreatic neck margin.\nLigate the root of the splenic vein with a vascular clamp and severe it sharply.\nTo skeletonize the common hepatic artery (CHA), left gastric artery, splenic artery (SpA), and CeA, dissect and clear en bloc suprapancreatic lymph nodes.",
    "Resect fat and fibrous tissues from the caudal to the cephalic side of the SMA and CeA.\nRemove the lymph nodes from the Heidelberg triangle, which is bounded by the PV, CeA, and SMA.\nDuring this procedure, isolate and divide the origin of the SpA on account of the larger dorsal and caudal spaces created.\nExpose the LRV to determine the dorsal dissection plane.\n\t\tNOTE: The left adrenal gland and Gerota's fascia should be completely removed for posterior RAMPS20,21.\nFinally, using an antegrade method (right-to-left), dissect the distal pancreas and spleen, as well as the surrounding soft tissues.\n\t\t​NOTE: As shown in Figure 2, the cephalic boundary of the resection region is the diaphragmatic crus, the caudal boundary is the LRV, and the interior range is on the left lateral portion of the aorta. Finally, introduce and place two drainage tubes in the pancreatic stump and splenic recess areas.\n3. Postoperative follow-up\nPerform a color Doppler ultrasound or CT scan of the abdomen on postoperative day 7 to assess the abdominal condition.\nCheck the amylase level of the abdominal drainage fluid on postoperative day 3, day 5, and day 7 to evaluate pancreatic fistula, which is one of the serious complications.\n\tNOTE: Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) can be diagnosed when the amylase level in drainage fluid is more than three times the upper limit of normal serum amylase activity, associated with a clinically relevant development/condition which is related directly to the pancreatic fistula22.\nRemove the drain when the amylase level is less than three times the upper limit of normal serum amylase.\nPerform 6-8 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy using gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel program 6-8 weeks after surgery.",
    "Perform long term follow-up after surgery. Conduct follow-up every 3 months in the first year, every 3-6 months in the second year, and then every 6 months after. Carbohydrate antigen 199 (CA-199), the CeA, the abdominal color Doppler ultrasound, or the CT scan should be rechecked during the follow-up.\nSubscription Required.
