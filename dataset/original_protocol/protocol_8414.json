  "procedures": [
    "All the procedures including the use of the animals have been approved by the institutional review board-approved protocols (IACUC- Midwestern University).\n1. Harvesting DRG from Mouse Embryos\nEuthanize the adult mice by asphyxiation method (CO2) followed by decapitation. Immediately proceed to surgically remove the vertebral column.\nExpose the vertebral column by cutting down the skin layer dorsally using fine scissors. Isolate the vertebral column by cutting through the ribs on either side of the column and through the sacrum separating the vertebral column from the rest of the animal.\nMount the vertebral column (ventral side up) onto a surgical mat using needles/pins.\nUsing fine scissors make a double cut on both sides of the vertebral bodies to expose the ventral side of the vertebral canal.\nUnder a surgical microscope (magnification set to 4X), use scissors to gently move the spinal cord on the side to expose the contralateral dorsal spinal roots and to locate the DRG, along the dorsal roots of the peripheral nerves. Each ganglion is partially hidden inside the intervertebral foramina.\nTo harvest the DRG, pinch the dorsal root (between the spinal cord and the DRG) with one forceps and gently pull out the DRG from the intervertebral foramen.\nPlace the second forceps on the spinal nerve peripheral to the DRG and pull the DRG together with the spinal nerve and spinal root.\nPlace the collected DRG in a 35 mm Petri dish containing 3 mL of ice-cold serum free media (SFM)34.\nTransfer each individual DRG in a dry glass Petri dish and, under a surgical microscope, clean and trim off excess fibers and connective tissue still attached to the DRG using a blade. The DRG is easily identifiable as a bulgy transparent structure along the white spinal nerve/root. Blood vessels often are found surrounding the DRG.",
    "Place the cleaned DRG in a new Petri dish containing ice-cold SFM media.\nDilute the gelatinous protein mixture (see Table of Materials) in ice-cold SFM (1:1).\nPlate the DRG ex vivo in 12-well plates pre-coated with 10/20 µL of gelatinous protein mixture and set them inside the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30-60 min.\nGently add 1.5-2 mL of SFM to the culture system to cover the entire explant and maintain the explants at culturing conditions (37 °C and 5% CO2).\n\tNOTE: This is a critical step because the DRG is anchored to the glass dishes only by the polymerized gelatinous protein mixture. Time of polymerization and pipetting skills are critical to avoid floating.\nChange the medium of growing DRG every 72 h and let the DRG grow for as long as needed.\n2. Isolating Single Cell Neurons from DRG\nPlace all the DRG collected in a 1.5 mL sterile tube with 1.2 mL of F12 media containing 1.25 mg/mL of collagenase IV and incubate it at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 45 min. Repeat this step for another 45 min after the first incubation.\nTreat explants with 2 mL of F12 media containing trypsin (0.025%) for 30 min immediately after the collagenase IV treatment at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nIncubate with 2 mL of F12 media containing fetal bovine serum (FBS; 33%) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 15 min.\nWash explants three times with 2 mL of F12 media and proceed to mechanically dissociate them with a glass pipette until the media turns cloudy.",
    "NOTE: This procedure involves collection of clean/trimmed DRG from the animal as explained in the prior section. When performing mechanical dissociation of explants, be gentle and do not use excessive force since it can lead to spillage and loss of working material.\nFilter the dissociated cell culture through a 0.22 µm filter to remove any impurities and excess connective tissue. Centrifuge the filtered cell lysate at (2,500 x g) for 2 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 500 µL of neurobasal media containing supplement for neuronal culture (1x), antibiotic mixture (1x), L-glutamate (0.5 mM), and nerve growth factor (5 µg/mL) (see Table of Materials).\nPlate the dissociated cells onto laminin-coated cover slides (50 µg/mL; see Table of Materials) at a preferred cell density. Determine the cell density using a cell counter.\n\tNOTE: We plated cells at 25,000 cells/cover slide. This technique allows dissociation of both neurons and glial satellite cells. The glial component co-cultured with the pseudounipolar neurons plays a critical role for neuronal survival.\n3. HSV-1 Infection of DRG Explants and DRG-derived Dissociated Cells\nNOTE: This work was done by strictly following the biosafety level-2 (BSL-2) requirements to which we have a fully equipped lab that is approved by the Midwestern University biosafety committee. A KOS strain of HSV-1 was used in this study. Please take appropriate measurements and safety precautions as per local institutions guidelines if working with virus strains.\nDetermine and prepare the virus in the correct dilutions in SFM media to infect the model. The virus used in this study was KOS strain of HSV-1. When working with DRG-derived dissociated cells, use 1 unit of multiplicity of infection (MOI) for infection, which means the number of virus equal the number of cells.",
    "If infecting DRG explants, use the number of virions (e.g., 10,000 virions) because an exact number of cells in an explant cannot be determined.\nPlace the explant/cells to be infected with virus in a sterile cell plate or tube containing a mixture of SFM media and virus.\n\tNOTE: We used 25,000 virions for a cover slide containing 25,000 cells (1 MOI). To infect an explant, we use 10,000 virions.\nPlace the cell plate or tube at 37 °C for infection to take place; time of viral exposure may vary depending on viral infectivity.\n\tNOTE: Viral entry was confirmed by using ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) assays26.\n4. Immunofluorescence\nFix the explants and single cell samples in 4% formalin prepared in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Wash samples 3 times for 10 min each in PBS.\nIncubate the samples with desired primary antibodies (anti-β-tubulin, anti-peripherin, anti-heparan sulfate (HS), and/or anti-glycoprotein D (gD) antibody; see Table of Materials for dilutions) diluted in PBS buffer with 0.3% Triton-X (PBST) and 10% normal goat serum. Store samples at 4 °C overnight.\nWash the samples 3 times for 10 min each with PBS. Incubate samples at room temperature for 1 h in the appropriate secondary antibody (488 and/or Cy3; see Table of Materials for dilutions) diluted in PBS.\nWash the samples 3 times for 10 min each with PBS. Incubate the samples with Hoechst dye (1.5 µM) in PBS for 20 min prior to mounting step.\nMount the samples on glass slides using a fluorescence mounting medium and coverslip.\nSubscription Required.
