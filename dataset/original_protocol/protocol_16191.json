    "Human primary cultures require the isolation of a specific cell type from tissues, for instance, from tissue discarded after surgery (Oliveira et al., 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-bib-0021]). Digestion of preputial skin allows one to efficiently isolate the cells of the foreskin, where fibroblasts are the most abundant cells of the dermis and the ones most commonly used for biomedical research. Even though the source of FSK cells may be limited because it is not possible to get extra material from the same donor, these cells can proliferate in the presence of serum, unlike some other cell types such as keratinocytes, which require additional culture supplementation for growth. Due to the lack of genetic manipulation, human primary cells are kept in culture only for a few passages, and are more sensitive than immortalized cells to small extracellular and intracellular changes. The cells start to grow out of the explant immediately after plating in a petri dish, and are easily maintained in the conditions described below until confluency (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-fig-0003]). Cells are inspected with an inverted microscope on a daily basis to observe normal growth.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/21684cb4-0023-4252-89d0-32ad21289ad6/cptx99-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nConfocal microscopy characterization of human primary foreskin fibroblasts (FSK). Human foreskin tissue obtained from circumcision is subjected to enzymatic digestion prior to isolation and seeding of the cells. The bright-field image on the right (obtained using confocal microscopy) shows the characteristic morphology of human primary cell cultures of FSK cells in culture, at confluency. Scale bar = 50 µm.\nFSK cells are cultured up to passage 6. To cryopreserve the cells, refer to Freshney (1987[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-bib-0009]).

    "We introduce a simple method based on crystal violet staining to evaluate FSK cell viability (Figs. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-fig-0004], 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-fig-0005]). This cationic dye works as an intercalating agent that enables the quantification of DNA, which is proportional to the number of cells in the culture, and the dye is easily sequestered by viable cells (Feoktistova, Geserick, & Leverkus, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-bib-0008]). FSK cells form a monolayer when they become confluent. During cell death, adherent cells detach from culture plates and are washed away (and thus, the signal is reduced). In this context, crystal violet can be used to show differences in proliferation and to quantify cell death under different experimental conditions, such as stimulation with death-inducing agents or exposure to genotoxic agents. So, it is possible to set this protocol up for multiple conditions, where untreated cells are considered as 100% and used as controls to obtain relative values of cell viability, provided that the same number of starting cells are used per condition. This assay is easy and reproducible, and does not require a standard curve. The cells isolated in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-prot-0001] are sub-cultured in a 6-well plate, and the count of viable cells is performed in a 96-well plate. One 6-well plate is required to be prepared per experimental condition to be compared.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/247762cd-a14b-4169-b7cc-8b8bcf09429b/cptx99-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nFlowchart depicting our strategy for measuring human primary foreskin fibroblasts (FSK) cell viability using crystal violet staining (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-prot-0002]).

    "12. Read absorbance λ = 570 with a plate reader or a spectrophotometer. For relative quantification, the average OD value obtained for control cells is set to 100%, and experimental values are expressed as percentage of control (see Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-fig-0005]). The mean and the standard error of the mean must be calculated for at least three independent experiments (in addition to multiple technical replicates per plate). Note that for each experiment, the same number of cells should be used for comparable results. The OD value for the blank (background) should be similar to the OD value of an empty well to avoid interference (refer to Critical Parameters and Troubleshooting, discussion of Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-prot-0002]).\nThe absorbance is directly proportional to the number of viable cells.",
    "Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful technology in cell biology that allows the visualization of cells, from the ultrastructure to the molecular level (Koster & Klumperman, 2003[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-bib-0015]), representing a useful approach to improve our understanding of cellular functions. All cellular components, including organelles and membrane systems, as well as specialized structures, have been characterized by TEM. Here, we describe a relatively simple step-by step protocol, where cells are collected by trypsinization, fixed with glutaraldehyde, and dehydrated in a series of increasing concentrations of ethanol. In this way, the cells can ultimately be embedded in resin and prepared for TEM. This protocol can be used to compare cells grown under different conditions, for which TEM can be used to study morphology, cellular damage, and mitochondrial dynamics (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-fig-0006]).

After 48 hr at 55°C-60°C, the resin-embedded sample is removed from the microcentrifuge tube with a razor blade. The excess resin is cut with a hacksaw and mounted on a wooden stick with epoxy adhesive. The mounted sample can be placed on the ultramicrotome holder and trimmed. The tip of the trapezoid can be a point, giving square sections, or a ridge, resulting in rectangular sections. At this point, the sample is ready for the preparation of the sections for TEM.\n42. Cut off the excess resin in excess with a hacksaw and glue with Devcon 5 min epoxy clear onto a ¼-in. wooden dowel. See Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-fig-0007] as a reference.\nRemoving resin in excess should leave behind the sample plus no more than 0.5 cm of resin.\n43. Let dry for 15-30 min at room temperature.\nTrimming and thin sectioning\n44. In an ultramicrotome, place the block into the specimen holder and tighten the clamping screw. The arm needs to be in the locked position. Make sure that the block is firmly fastened into the holder, as loose blocks can interfere with sectioning.\n45. Trim the block to a truncated pyramid (Fig. 7B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-fig-0007]), with the base section area being as small as possible. This helps to prepare good sections later. Using a clean razor blade and looking down the binoculars of the inverted microscope, remove the excess resin from each of the four sides of the block to obtain a truncated pyramid (Fig. 7B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-fig-0007]).",
    "46. Use a glass knife to trim the front surface of the block before you start cutting the specimen. At this stage, cut semi-thin sections of about 500 nm to get access to the specimen.\n47. Smooth the surface with a glass knife (examine the knife in the ultramicrotome using the black light to ensure that the edge is sharp and dust-free).\n48. Replace the glass knife with a diamond knife (see Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-fig-0008]). Fill the diamond knife holder with EM-grade H2O, and check that the holder is tightly fastened and at a clearance angle of 6°.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/62028ca9-bf65-495d-ab26-47c99766dbe9/cptx99-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nPreparation and collection of ultra-thin sections on electron microscopy (EM) grids. Ultra-thin sections of embedded human primary foreskin fibroblasts are prepared with a Leica ultramicrotome using a diamond knife. The sections are collected with the perfect loop and transferred to EM grids. Excess water is removed with Whatman paper.\n49. Advance the knife/knife holder by hand to within ∼1 mm of the block and clamp the holder in position.\n50. With the specimen arm in the upper, locked position, adjust the position of the block so that the top of the block is positioned just below the knife edge.\nThis sets the end of the cutting stroke (when the motor cuts-in again to initiate another cutting cycle) and, by default, also sets the beginning of the free-fall cutting stroke (this is ∼4 mm above the knife edge).",
    "51. Advance the knife stage using the wheel at the front of the microtome until only a thin slit of reflected light is visible on the specimen face. This slit of light should be of the same thickness along the whole face of the block. This means that the block face and the knife edge are parallel in the left-right direction. Proceed with any necessary rotational or lateral adjustments to make this slit of light parallel.\n52. Carefully move the block up and down in front of the knife and watch the slit of light to see if it changes in thickness.\n53. Align the block face to the knife.\n54. Advance the knife until the thin slit of light begins to appear yellow and/or disappears. At this stage, the knife is approximately 1 μm from the specimen face.\n55. Fill the knife boat with filtered distilled H2O until a silvered reflection is visible off the surface of the liquid.\n56. Start cutting individual sections by hand and then activate the motor to begin automatic sectioning in a ribbon on the surface of the water.\n57. Adjust the section thickness settings to obtain pale gold or silver sections.\nIn conventional TEM, sections need to be in the range of 50-70 nm of thickness to obtain sharply focused images at high magnification (>30,000×). Semi-thin sections allow samples to be screened to select specific areas for thin sectioning. Semi-thin sections are cut between 0.5 and 1 μm from trimmed blocks and viewed by bright-field microscopy. Various cationic dyes, including crystal violet, toluidine blue, and methylene blue, can be used for contrast.\nPicking up ultra-thin sections on a grid",
    "58. Expand the sections with chloroform (Fig. 8[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-fig-0008]). For this, use either a thin, wedge-shaped piece of filter paper or a cotton swab soaked in the chloroform, and gently wave it over the sections. Be careful not to over-expand the sections, as this can lead to damage (cracks and /or loss of material from the section).\n59. Collect the sections onto a grid by carefully lowering the grid, dull-side-downwards, onto the sections.\nAn average of 3-10 sections can be collected onto each grid.\n60. Place the grid onto a piece of filter paper with the sections facing upwards. The water will be absorbed through the grid mesh and the sections will become visible on the grid.\nAn alternative method of collecting sections is by putting the grid under the liquid in the knife boat and then coming up under the sections with the grid.\n61. Let the grids completely dry on filter paper before proceeding with the staining.\nLead stain (Sato's staining)\n62. Cut the parafilm into 10 × 10 cm size pieces and place in a glass petri dish. Do not touch the surface of the parafilm with your hands prior to staining (Fig. 9A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-fig-0009]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2d2dd445-fca7-4783-9b1c-b46902551068/cptx99-fig-0009-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 9\nLead staining of ultra-thin sections for electron microscopy visualization. Ultra-thin sections are stained with uranyl acetate (A) and lead (B) for electron microscopy analysis. The grids are allowed to dry, and excess water is removed with Whatman paper.\n63. Take 1 ml of 2% uranyl acetate in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge 5 min at 13,000 × g, room temperature.\n64. Transfer to a 1-ml syringe attached to a 0.2-µm syringe filter.\n65. Discard the first drop and put a series of drops onto the Parafilm according to the number of grids to stain.",
    "66. Lower the grids onto the surface of the uranyl acetate drops (the uranyl acetate impurities are on the bottom of the drops).\n67. Cover with a dark box to protect from light.\n68. Incubate at room temperature for 15-20 min.\n69. Prepare a couple of beakers (50 or 100 ml) with distilled H2O.\n70. After incubation, place the grids into the beakers and wash using a plastic pipette.\n71. Collect the grids with reverse forceps. Wash with some additional drops of distilled H2O using a syringe with a filter.\n72. Blot from the side with filter paper and lay the forceps, holding the grids, in a covered petri dish to dry. The drying can be done on a clean filter paper in a covered glass petri dish. To complete drying, place the grids into the grid box.\n73. Prepare lead stain as described in Reagents and Solutions.\n74. Take an aliquot of the lead stain solution (1 ml) in a microcentrifuge tube and spin it down in a tabletop microcentrifuge for 2-3 min, at maximum speed.\nThe remaining solution is stored in the syringe at 4°C. The use of the syringe helps to minimize/prevent the exposure of the solution to the air that may cause the formation of precipitates.\n75. Cut some parafilm and place it in a glass petri dish. Add some pellets of NaOH (3-4 grains; 1 grain size = 0.5 × 0.3 mm).\n76. Bleed off the first drop and put a series of drops on the parafilm, according to the number of grids to stain (Fig. 9B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cptx.99#cptx99-fig-0009]).\n77. Take the grids and place them on the bottom of the drops by perpendicular immersion. Do not breathe over the lead stain, as this will cause CO2 contamination and subsequently, background.",
    "78. Incubate for 45 s at room temperature and immediately place the grids into beakers with distilled H2O.\n79. Wash the grids with a plastic pipette.\n80. Remove the grids with the reverse forceps and wash with some additional drops of distilled H2O using a syringe with filter.\n81. Blot from the side with filter paper and lay forceps holding grids in a covered petri dish to dry. To complete drying, put the grids into the grid box. Alternatively, the dry treatment can be done on a clean filter paper in a covered glass petri dish.\nGrids are now ready for electron microscopy analysis."
