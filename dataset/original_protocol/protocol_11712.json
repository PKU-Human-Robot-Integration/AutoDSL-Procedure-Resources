    "NOTE : Use sterile technique throughout the protocol, excluding steps 1.2 and 1.3. Warm all culture media and solutions to 37 °C before applying to cells or organoids. Cultivate cells in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2 upon 80% humidity. The protocol scheme is shown in Figure 1.\n1. Transforming Petri dishes into mini bioreactors\nCut sterile 15 mL centrifuge tubes in rings of 7-8 mm in height; autoclave the rings.\nBreak low-adhesion, untreated or microbiological Petri dishes into crumbs. Dissolve about 1 g of plastic crumbs in 10 mL of chloroform overnight to prepare liquid plastic.\n\t​CAUTION: Work in a fume hood.\nCheck that the resulting liquid plastic is viscous enough for pipetting; its drop retains a spherical form and does not spread on the surface. If it is very liquid, add more plastic crumbs. If it is thick, then add chloroform.\nMake a plastic knob in the center of a sterile ultra-low adhesion 6-cm Petri dish. There are two equally suitable ways, as detailed below.\n\t\nPut the autoclaved plastic ring on the center and drop the liquid plastic to the inside of the ring.\nWithout any plastic ring, drop the liquid plastic on the center of the Petri dish.\nLeave the dishes open for 2-3 h in a laminar flow hood until dried complete. Treat the dried dishes with ultraviolet radiation for 15-20 min.\n2. Induction of neuronal differentiation of iPSCs\nCultivate iPSCs in the medium for pluripotent stem cells up to 75-90% confluence in 35 mm Petri dishes precoated with a matrix consisting of extracellular proteins.\nPrepare medium A-SR. See Table 1 for details.\nAspirate the cultivation medium and add 2 mL of A-SR medium at Day 0 of differentiation.\nPrepare medium A (see Table 2).",
    "Cultivate cells in medium A for two weeks from Days 2-14, refreshing medium in Petri dishes every other day.\n3. The formation of spheroids from neuroepithelial precursor cells at Day 14\nAt Day 14, make spheroids from neuroepithelial precursor cells using a special 24-well culture plate containing approximately 1,200 microwells in each well (Figure 2C). Follow the procedure given below.\n\tNOTE: At this differentiation stage, a 35 mm Petri dish usually contains 3 - 3.5 x 106 neuroepithelial precursor cells. Thus, one 35 mm Petri dish with neuroepithelial precursor cells is sufficient for 3 - 4 wells of 24-well culture plate with microwells.\nPrepare a 24-well culture plate with microwells: To each well, add 1 mL of medium A. Centrifuge briefly at 1,300 x g for 5 min in swinging bucket rotor fitted with plate holder. Control under the microscope that there are no bubbles in microwells.\nPrepare the medium B (Table 3).\nRemove the medium from the Petri dish with neuroepithelial precursor cells; wash the cells with 2 mL of DMEM/F12. For the cell detachment, treat the cells with 1.5 mL of 0.48 mM EDTA solution prepared in PBS. Control the cell detachment under the microscope.\nHarvest the cells into a 15 mL tube. Add 5 mL of DMEM/F12 in the tube to wash the cells. Centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend cells in 2 mL of medium B.\nCheck the cell concentration and viability by Trypan Blue staining and a hemocytometer. Calculate the volume of suspension needed to contain 1 x 106 viable cells in total.",
    "Transfer the cell suspension containing 1 x 106 cells into each well of a 24-well plate with microwells. Add medium B up to 2 mL into each well, gently pipette cells up and down several times, and centrifuge briefly 100 x g for 1 min to capture cells in the microwells.\n\tNOTE: The number of cells per well should not exceed 1 x 106. Otherwise, spheroids from neighboring microwells fuse.\nCheck under the microscope that cells are evenly distributed in microwells. Repeat pipetting and centrifugation if cells are distributed unevenly.\nIncubate the plate overnight to let cells aggregate in spheroids.\n4. Obtaining and cultivation of organoids\nThe next morning (Day 15), check the quality of spheroids under the microscope. Ensure that they are transparent and smooth, if healthy (Figure 2A,B). Carefully collect the spheroids from each well into a 15 mL tube, leave the spheroids to precipitate by gravity for 2-3 min, and then remove the supernatant.\nAdd to the spheroids 2 mL of the matrix thawed during the same time on ice. Mix gently by pipetting and incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nTo wash excess of the matrix, add to the tube 8 mL of medium B. Pipette gently, then centrifuge the tube for 1 min at 100 x g.\n\tNOTE: Do not exceed the time and the speed of centrifugation to avoid the irreversible aggregation of spheroids.\nRemove the supernatant. Add to the tube 2 mL of medium B, pipette gently. Split the spheroid suspension between two mini bioreactors, each containing 4 mL of medium B. Place the mini bioreactors into a 15 cm Petri dish to prevent the evaporation of water and to avoid contamination.",
    "Put the Petri dish with mini bioreactors on an orbital shaker. Cultivate the organoids at a rotation rate of 70-75 rpm.\nOn Day 16, prepare medium C (Table 4).\nTransfer the organoids into 15 mL tube. For 5 min, let them fall to the bottom, aspirate the supernatant, add 5 mL of medium C. Return the organoids into the mini bioreactors.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to lose the spheroids, which are transparent and barely visible.\nCultivate spheroids in medium C for two weeks, refreshing the medium every two days. At the end of these two weeks, leave about 100 spheroids per mini bioreactor for the following cultivation. Freeze excessive spheroids in a freezing medium in liquid nitrogen.\nOn Day 30, prepare medium D (Table 5).\nChange the cultivation medium to medium D, which is a maturation medium. Refresh cultivation medium every 2-3 days for three weeks, then use medium D without BDNF and GDNF.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
