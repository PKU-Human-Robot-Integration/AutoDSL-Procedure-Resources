    "This study was approved by the Federal University of the Jequitinhonha and Mucuri Valleys Ethics and Research Committee. All participants were informed of the study objectives and experimental procedures of the study and signed a written informed consent form before their participation.\n1. Experimental design\nSelect individuals who meet the inclusion criteria: nonsmoking healthy individuals aged between 30 and 50 years with body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg·m-2 and maximum oxygen consumption lesser than 50 mL O2·kg-1·min-1 and engage them in regular physical exercise practices no more than 2 days a week for the past 3 months.\nApply the physical activity readiness questionnaire (PARq)8 to stratify signs or symptoms of cardiovascular disease, metabolic, or any other condition that impedes physical exercise practice.\nPair the participants firstly by BMI and secondly by maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max), and randomly divide them into one of the two groups, the Moderate-Intensity Continuous Training group (MICT; n = 11) and the High-Intensity Interval Training group (HIIT; n = 11).\nPerform the MICT or HIIT protocol (Figure 1).\nRecord the VO2 max before and after the exercise training protocols.\n2. VO2 max test (Ramp protocol)\nFamiliarize the participants with the treadmill and the mouthpiece used on the metabolic analyzer for at least 24 h before testing.\nCalibrate the metabolic analyzer according to the manufacturers' recommendations.\nUse a heart rate monitor to measure the participants' heart rate.\nPlace the non-rebreathing unilateral mouthpiece on the patient ensuring to cover the participant's mouth and nose completely.\nUse the subject's physical activity level to program the speed and degree of maximal metabolic equivalent (MET) increments9.\nTurn on the treadmill, select the Ramp protocol, and enter the subject's physical activity level (i.e., estimated maximal MET).",
    "Press ON to start the Ramp protocol, which starts with a warm-up of 3 min at 5 km/h.\n\tNOTE: The ramp protocol estimates the progression of the test according to the informed subject's physical activity level and calculates an exercise test duration between 8 and 12 min.\nRecord heart rate (HR) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) using the Borg scale 6-20 every min of the test.\nConsider that VO2 max is achieved when all the following criteria are met: respiratory exchange rate (RER) greater than 1.10; HR greater than 95% of the maximum HR predicted for the age (220-age); and RPE equal to or greater than 18.\nReturn the treadmill speed to 5 km/h (warm-up value) and remain on the treadmill for an additional 3 min.\nTurn off the treadmill and remove the mouthpiece from the participant.\n3. Beep test (Leger et al.7)\nChoose a flat surface that allows placing two cones with 20 m of the distance between them.\nOrient participants to run 20 m (marked by cones) within a predetermined period signaled by a beep sound produced by a specific software developed for this test.\nAdjust the sound equipment connected to the computer with the software.\nFamiliarize the participants with the test.\nStart the test.\n\tNOTE: The Beep Test software automatically reduces the timing of the beep sound so that the running speed increases by 0.5 km/h for every stage of the test.\nEnd the test when the volunteer can no longer complete the 20 m run within the time stipulated by the beep sound.\n4. Training protocols\nNOTE: Table 1 summarizes the progression of the exercise protocols (MICT and HIIT) during the 8 weeks of training.\nMICT protocol",
    "Orient each participant to maintain the running speed during the exercise sessions according to the GPS from the heart rate monitor.\nInstruct the participants to complete a 5 min warm-up by performing dynamic stretches and walking before each exercise session.\nPut on a heart rate (HR) monitor equipped with GPS tracking before each exercise session.\nStart the exercise session.\nInstruct the participants to maintain correct speed and distance by periodically checking the clock's speed and distance on the heart rate monitor.\nTrain the participants for 2 weeks, three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), once a day at 60% of the individual maximum speed achieved during the 20 m test (Vmax), covering a distance of 3,500 m per session in the first week and 4,000 m per session in the second week.\nTrain the participants for 4 weeks, three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), once a day at 65% of Vmax, covering a distance of 4,000 m per session in the third week, 4,500 m per session in the fourth and fifth week, and 5,000 m per session in the sixth week.\nTrain the participants for 1 week, three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), once a day at 70% of Vmax, covering a distance of 5,000 m per session in the seventh week.\nTrain the participants for 1 week, three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday), once a day at 75% of Vmax, covering a distance of 5,000 m per session in the eighth week.\nTrain the participants at 70% of Vmax, covering a daily distance of 5,000 m in the seventh week.\nTrain the participants at 75% of Vmax, covering a daily distance of 5,000 m in the eighth week.\nTrain the MICT group either in the morning or afternoon.",
    "Transfer the data recorded by the HR monitor to a computer after each exercise session to verify if the prescribed distance and running speed were reached.\nExclude the participants who do not complete all the training sessions in the week.\nAnalyze the data to ensure that each participant performs the respective training regimen according to the prescribed distance and speed.\nHIIT protocol\n\t\nCalculate the time interval between beep sounds every 20 m according to the Vmax% prescribed for each exercise session.\nOpen the Sound Forge PRO software.\nEnter the information such as how many seconds the beep sound must shoot, how many times the shoots must occur to complete each exercise sprint, and the interval period between the sprints (corresponding to passive recovery).\nDownload the individual sound files in MP3 format.\nSend the beep sound file to the cell phone of each participant.\nMark a lane with cones every 20 m.\nInstruct the participant to follow the command of the beep sounds (by listening to them through headphones), guiding the exact moment when each subject must reach the cone (placed every 20 m away).\nInstruct the participants to complete a 5 min warm-up by performing dynamic stretches and walking before each exercise session.\nPut on a heart rate (HR) monitor equipped with GPS tracking before each exercise session.\nStart the exercise session.\nTrain the participants with seven sprints (first week) and eight sprints (second week) of 200 m at 85% of Vmax, interspersed by 1 min of passive recovery between sprints.\nTrain the participants with eight sprints (third week), nine sprints (fourth and fifth week), and 10 sprints (sixth week) of 200 m at 90% of Vmax, interspersed by 1 min of passive recovery.",
    "Train the participants with 10 sprints (seventh week) of 200 m at 95% of Vmax interspersed by 1 min of passive recovery.\nTrain the participants with 10 sprints (eighth week) of 200 m at 100% of Vmax interspersed by 1 min of passive recovery.\nTrain the HIIT group once a day, three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) in the morning or afternoon.\nTransfer the data recorded by the HR monitor to a computer after each exercise session.\nExclude the participants who do not complete all the training sessions in the week.\nAnalyze the data to ensure that each participant performs the respective training regimen according to the prescribed distance and speed.\n5. Statistical analysis\nExpress all data as mean ± standard deviation.\nCheck the normality of data using the Shapiro-Wilk test.\nAnalyze the data using one or two-Way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc test; set the significance level at 5%.\nSubscription Required.
