    "The protocol was reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee (approval number 287/2020B02).\n1. Preparation of calcium phosphate coated cell culture plates\nPreparation of calcium stock solution (25 mM CaCl2·2H2O, 1.37 mM NaCl, 15 mM MgCl2·6H2O in Tris buffer)\n\t\nPrepare 1.0 M Tris buffer and adjust pH to 7.4 using 1 M HCl.\nSet up a glass beaker on a magnetic stirrer and add 100 mL of 1.0 M Tris buffer.\nWeigh out 0.368 g of CaCl2·2H2O, 8.0 g of NaCl, and 0.305 g of MgCl2·6H2O and dissolve in Tris buffer one by one.\nAdjust pH to 7.4 using 1 M HCl. Store at room temperature.\nPreparation of phosphate stock solution (11.1 mM Na2HPO4·H2O, 42 mM NaHCO3 in Tris buffer)\n\t\nSet up a glass beaker on a magnetic stirrer and add 100 mL of 1.0 M Tris buffer.\nWeigh out 0.158 g of Na2HPO4·H2O and 0.353 g of NaHCO3 and dissolve in Tris buffer one by one.\nAdjust pH to 7.4 using 1 M HCl. Store at room temperature.\nPre-calcification of 96-well cell culture plates\n\t\nPrepare 30 mL of working solution by mixing 15 mL of 1.0 M Tris buffer, 7.5 mL of calcium stock (step 1.1.4) solution, and 7.5 mL of phosphate stock solution (step 1.2.3). Filter the solution with a 0.2 µm filter.\nPrepare a 96-well cell culture plate with flat bottom. Pipette 300 µL of calcium phosphate solution (step 1.3.1.) to each well. Cover the plate with a lid and incubate the plate at 37 °C for 3 days.\nPreparation of calcium phosphate solution (2.25 mM Na2HPO4·H2O, 4 mM CaCl2·2H2O, 0.14 M NaCl, 50 mM Tris base in ddH2O)",
    "Add 2 mL of 1 M HCl to 40 mL of deionized water in a beaker with a magnetic stirring bead and dissolve 0.016 g of Na2HPO4·H2O, 0.0295 g of CaCl2·2H2O, 0.409 g of NaCl, and 0.303 g of Tris base one by one.\nAdjust pH to 7.4 using 1 M HCl. Add deionized water to fill the volume to 50 mL. Filter the solution with a 0.2 µm filter.\nCalcification of 96-well cell culture plates\n\t\nAspirate pre-calcification solution from the pre-calcified 96-well cell culture plates and add 300 µL of calcium phosphate solution (step 1.4.2) to each well. Cover the plates with a lid and incubate at 37 °C for 1 day.\nTurn the plate over to pour out the solution and wash the plate three times with deionized water thoroughly. Dry the plate immediately using a hair dryer or compressed CO2 or N2 gas to maintain a uniform surface.\nSterilize the coated plate by UV radiation in a clean bench for 1 h. Use the coated plate immediately or seal the plate with parafilm and store it at room temperature.\n2. Isolation of PBMCs from human peripheral blood\nDraw 15 mL of blood from the vein after obtaining written informed consent from the blood donor (ethical vote: 287/2020B02).\nDilute 15 mL of fresh blood with an equal volume of PBS and mix by inverting the tube several times or by drawing the mixture in and out of a pipette.\nPrepare a 50 mL conical tube containing 15 mL of density gradient solution (e.g., Ficoll, Table of Materials) per tube. Tilt the tube and carefully layer 30 mL of diluted blood sample onto the 15 mL of density gradient solution (diluted blood sample: density gradient solution, 1:0.5-1 ratio).",
    "NOTE: When overlaying the sample, pay attention not to mix the density gradient solution with the diluted blood sample.\nCentrifuge at 810 x g for 20 min at 20 °C in a swinging-bucket rotor without brake.\nAspirate the upper layer leaving the mononuclear cell layer (lymphocytes, monocytes, and thrombocytes) undisturbed at the interphase.\nCarefully transfer the mononuclear cell layer to a new 50 mL conical tube.\nFill the tube with PBS, mix, and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at 20 °C (brake can be used from this stage onwards).\nCarefully remove supernatant completely. Resuspend the cell pellet in 50 mL of PBS and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at 20 °C. Carefully remove the supernatant completely.\nFor removal of platelets, resuspend the cell pellet in 50 mL of PBS and centrifuge at 200 x g for 10 min at 20 °C. Carefully remove the supernatant completely.\nTransfer resuspended cells to cell culture flasks for expansion of OC progenitors.\n3. Expansion of OC progenitors\nResuspend PBMCs in complete α-MEM (10% FBS, 1% Pen/Strep, 1% amphotericin B) containing 20 ng/mL M-CSF. Seed PBMCs at a density of 2.5 x 105 cells/cm2. Usually, cells isolated from 15-20 mL fresh blood can be seeded in one 75 cm2 flask (1.5-2 x 107 cells).\nFeed the cells with fresh complete α-MEM containing 20 ng/mL M-CSF every third day until the attached cells reach a desired confluency. Typical yields are 1.5-2 x 106 cells/flask when cells are 95% confluent. Usually, the expansion period lasts 6 days.\n\t​NOTE: The osteoclastogenic potential of the precursors can decrease with prolonged cultivation time.\n4. Induction of osteoclastogenesis in CaP coated plates\nTo facilitate cell adhesion, incubate the CaP coated plates with 50 µL of FBS for 1 h in a 37 °C incubator.",
    "To detach the OC precursors, wash the flask with PBS twice to remove dead or non-adherent cells. Add 4 mL of trypsin (Table of Materials) per 75 cm2 flask, for 30 min.\n\t\nAdd 4 mL of complete α-MEM to stop the digestion, carefully detach the cells using a cell scraper and transfer the cells into a 50 mL tube.\nDetermine the total cell number using a Neubauer chamber or similar.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation for 7 min at 350 x g. Resuspend the pellet in sufficient complete α-MEM containing 20 ng/mL M-CSF and 20 ng/mL RANKL to get a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL.\nAspirate FBS solution from the CaP coated 96-well plate and pipette 200 µL of cell suspension per well (2 x 105 cells/well).\nIncubate the OC precursors for the desired time period or with the desired reagents relevant to the experimental design. Usually, high numbers of large and multinucleated OCs can be observed after 6 days and when resorption pits are forming. Feed cells with fresh complete α-MEM medium containing 20 ng/mL M-CSF and 20 ng/mL RANKL every third day.\nAt the end of incubation, wash cells with PBS twice, fix with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, and wash with PBS again.\nUse the fixed OCs directly for fluorescence staining or store at 4 °C.\n5. Fluorescence staining of OCs and CaP coating\nIncubate the fixed cells with permeabilization buffer (0.1% Triton in PBS) for 5 min.\nStain actin filaments with 100 µL of AlexaFluor 546 labeled phalloidin solution in PBS for 30 min and aspirate the staining solution. Add 100 µL of Hoechst 33342 staining solution (10 µg/mL in PBS) for 10 min to stain nuclei. DAPI can also be used.",
    "Stain CaP coating with 100 µL of 10 µM calcein in PBS for 10 min. Wash three times with PBS and take images.\nAfter fluorescence imaging the same plates can be used to quantify resorption pit area by Von Kossa staining. To do so, wash the plates with deionized water twice.\n6. Quantification of total resorption pit area\nTo stain CaP coating with Von Kossa staining, incubate with 50 µL of 5% AgNO3 in deionized water per well under UV radiation for 1 h, until the coating on the bottom of the wells has turned brown.\nWash the plate three times with deionized water and take brightfield images. An objective with little magnification, such as a 1.25x objective, can be used to capture the whole well in one image. This facilitates subsequent image analysis. Alternative methods to capture the whole area of the well can be applied.\nOpen an image file with ImageJ: File | Open | Image | Type | 8-bit. Verify the scale unit in the lower right corner of the image using Straight Line | Analyze | Set Scale. Enter the length in the \"known distance\" blanket, enter new scale unit in Unit of length, and check the box Global.\nList measurement parameters to be analyzed: Analyze | Set Measurements. In the Set Measurements window, check the Area and Limit to threshold boxes.\nMeasure the area of pits: Image | Adjust | Threshold. In the Threshold window, check box Dark background and click Auto. The area of pits turns red. Close the Threshold window and select Analyze | Measure. Save the result file: File | Save As.\n7. Quantification of OC number and size, and normalized resorption pit area\nOpen a fluorescence image of osteoclasts with ImageJ and verify the scale unit (see step 6.3).",
