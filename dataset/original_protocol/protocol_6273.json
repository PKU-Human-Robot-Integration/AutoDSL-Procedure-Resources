    "For this study, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line was purchased from National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS, Pune, India). The cells were cultured in cell growth medium (Recipe 1) in a CO2 incubator maintained at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.Note: Purchase cells from a recognized cell center and maintain them according to the instructions provided by the supplier. Maintenance of cellsNote: The following steps are to be performed inside a biosafety cabinet class II following aseptic culture techniques.Once the cells reach a confluency of 80%-90%, subculture them as follows:Aspirate the spent medium and collect it in a sterile 15 ml centrifuge tube.Wash twice with 1x PBS (Recipe 2).Add 500 μl of 1x Trypsin (Recipe 3) to the cells and incubate at 37 °C for 2-3 min.Notes: Keep trypsin at room temperature for 5-10 min after retrieving from 4 °C before use.The amount of trypsin recommended is for 60 mm dish or T25 flasks. For larger surface area, adjust the volume of trypsin used accordingly. Gently tap along the side of dish to dislodge the cells. Do not leave cells in trypsin for more than 5 min.Add 1-2 ml spent medium to neutralize the effect of trypsin and collect the cells in a labeled 15 ml centrifuge tube.Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to obtain the cell pellet. Discard the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in 1 ml of fresh growth medium.Resuspend cells properly and take out small volume of cells (50 μl) for counting.Add an equal volume of 0.4% trypan blue (Recipe 5), mix and count viable cells using hemocytometer.Seed cells in a 100 mm dish at a density of 5,000 cells/cm2 in 10 ml of growth medium. Allow the cells to attach overnight.",
    "Note: This seeding density is recommended for MDA-MB-231 cell line. Depending on the growth rate of cells used, seed cells at a density that will give at least 1 x 106 cells at the time of harvesting the cells for experiment. After 24 h, check the cells under the microscope for any contamination, add the stimulator/drugs/molecules for treatment at required concentration, and incubate the cells for the required amount of time in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Note: For the current analysis, the cells were treated with 1 μM LDN193189 hypochloride (Recipe 8) for 24 h.Harvesting of cellsNotes:Before starting the experiment go through the entire protocol and ensure the availability of all required materials and the temperature of water bath has reached 37 °C.Pre-warm PBS at 37 °C for 30 min and pre-warm trypsin at 37 °C for no longer than 2-3 min.Temperature of the cells should be maintained at 37 °C until the fixation step is completed, as fluctuation in temperature can lead to dephosphorylation of the phospho-proteins.Perform the following steps in a 37 °C water bath, but not in an incubator to ensure maintenance of uniform temperature during the procedure. Handle the dish carefully, so that the dish is not contaminated with the water from the water bath. Take the cells out from the CO2 incubator, discard the media immediately by pouring directly to bio-hazard waste container and place the dish in a 37 °C water bath.Add 10 ml of pre-warmed 1x PBS along the wall of dish and swirl the dish gently to wash off the growth medium completely.Discard the PBS and remove any remaining PBS by gently tapping the dish on tissue towel for 3-4 s.Immediately place the dish in the water bath and add 900 μl of pre-warmed 1x Trypsin (see Recipes).",
    "Gently swirl the dish to ensure uniform distribution of trypsin. Incubate for 1-3 min depending on the cells type.Note: The amount of trypsin recommended in this step is for 100 mm dish. Adjust the volume according to the size of the dish used for experiment. Gently tap the dish on the sides to ensure proper detachments of cells. A slight turbidity can be observed after trypsinization.Add 100 μl of pre-warmed FBS directly to the dish to neutralize the effect of trypsin and mix by pipetting.Note: Steps B2-B6 should be performed in the water bath.Fixation of cellsNotes: Perform Steps C2-C4 at room temperature.Some phospho-proteins and/or antibodies might require a different fixation buffer, the user should check with the manufacturer before proceeding with the fixation of cells. Add 1 ml 4% formaldehyde (Recipe 6) directly to the cells, mix well by pipetting 3-4 times and transfer the cell suspension into a FACS tube.Note: 4% paraformaldehyde can also be used instead of 4% formaldehyde for fixation following the same steps as mentioned above. Vortex the cell suspension for about 10-15 s at 2500 rpm and incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Add 2 ml of staining buffer (Recipe 7) to the cell suspension and centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.Wash the cells by resuspending the pellet in 2 ml of ice-cold 1x PBS. Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant.Permeabilization of cells While vortexing at a speed of 2500 rpm, add ice-cold 100% methanol (1 ml for 1 x 106 cells) drop-wise to the cell pellet.Note: Keep 100% methanol on ice for 2 h or alternatively at -20 °C overnight prior to starting the experiment.",
    "After addition of methanol, cover the tube with a cap to avoid methanol loss and incubate for at least 1 h at 4 °C (Figure 1).Notes:After methanol addition, cells can be stored for a week at -20 °C.Although most of the phospho-proteins and antibodies can work well with methanol mediated permeabilization, some phospho-proteins and/or antibodies might require a different permeabilization buffer, the user should check with the manufacturer before proceeding further.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191015/20191015010757_9393.jpgFigure 1. Procedure describing sample processing for phospho protein staining Phospho-protein staining and flow cytometry analysisAdd 4 ml of staining buffer to the cells in methanol, centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant gently without disturbing the cell pellet.Resuspend the cell pellet in 2 ml of staining buffer. Centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in 100 μl of staining buffer and distribute 50 μl of cell suspension per FACS tube for further staining.Note: Make sure that at least 5 x 105 cells per tube are used for further staining for phospho-proteins. Add phospho-specific primary unconjugated or fluorescent conjugated antibody to the cells according to the specifications of the manufacturer to one of the tubes and add isotype control to the other tube.Gently vortex the suspension for 10 s and incubate at room temperature in the dark for 1 h.Add 2 ml of staining buffer, centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant carefully.If a fluorescent conjugated antibody was used in Step E4, proceed directly to Step E9. If an unconjugated primary antibody was used, resuspend the cell pellet in 50 μl of staining buffer. Add fluorescent dye conjugated secondary antibody and incubate at room temperature in the dark for 1 h.",
    "Add 2 ml of staining buffer, centrifuge at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and discard the supernatant carefully.Resuspend the pellet in 300 μl of staining buffer and keep on ice.Analyze the samples in a flow cytometer using proper settings for the fluorescence detection channels (Figure 2).Note: Ensure that the excitation and emission wavelength of the fluorophore conjugated-antibody is compatible with the flow cytometer used.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191015/20191015010715_0645.jpgFigure 2. Flow cytometric analysis of phospho-SMAD1/8. MDA-MB-231 cells were stained with PE conjugated anti-Smad1 (pS463/pS465)/Smad8 (pS465/pS467) antibody (Phospho-SMAD1/8). Cells were left untreated (Control) or treated with BMP inhibitor LDN193189 (Inhibitor treated). Orange line is the unstained control for control cells and light blue line is the unstained control for inhibitor treated cells."
