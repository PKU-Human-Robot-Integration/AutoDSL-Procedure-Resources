    "Preparation of in vitro transcribed RNA standards for SARS-CoV-2 E genePrepare PCR product as template for in vitro transcription: Run PCR with AccuPower® PCR PreMix (-dye) kit as manufacturer’s instructions. Use pET21a plasmid containing SARS-CoV-2 Envelope gene as template and T7 promoter primer and T7 terminator primer.Perform in vitro transcription using MEGAscriptTM T7 Transcription Kit as manufacturer’s instructions.Confirm RNA product by subjecting a portion to formaldehyde-MOPS denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. The same volume of RNA loading buffer II included in MEGAscriptTM T7 Transcription Kit was added and heated for 10 min at 65 °C for sampling. Post-stain gel with 2x SYBR green II in 1x TAE and obtain image using ChemiDocTM Touch Imaging System (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3804/bioprotoc-10-21-3804-g002.jpgFigure 2. Agarose gel image of in vitro transcribed SARS-CoV-2 E gene RNA. Two 10-fold serial dilutions are loaded. Ladder sizes are corresponding to 1,000, 800, 600, 400, 300, and 200 bp from up.Measure RNA concentration with QuantusTM Fluorometer.Calculate RNA copy number.Obtain molecular weight (M.W.) of the transcribed RNA (corresponding sequence: 5′-GGGGAAUUGUGAGCGGAUAACAAUUCCCCUCUAGAAAUAAUUUUGUUUAACUUUAAGAAGGAGAUAUACAUAUGUACUCAUUCGUUUCGGAAGAGACAGGUACGUUAAUAGUUAAUAGCGUACUUCUUUUUCUUGCUUUCGUGGUAUUCUUGCUAGUUACACUAGCCAUCCUUACUGCGCUUCGAUUGUGUGCGUACUGCUGCAAUAUUGUUAACGUGAGUCUUGUAAAACCUUCUUUUUACGUUUACUCUCGUGUUAAAAAUCUGAAUUCUUCUAGAGUUCCUGAUCUUCUGGUCUAACUCGAGCACCACCACCACCACCACUGAGAUCCGGCUGCUAACAAAGCCCGAAAGGAAGCUGAGUUGGCUGCUGCCACCGCUGAGCAAUAACUAGC-3′) using Polynucleotide Molecular Weight Calculator, or using following formula where “#N” represents the number of each nucleotide.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201029/20201029005719_0734.jpgCalculate copy number using following formula: imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201029/20201029005827_8873.jpg Make 10-fold serial dilutions in TE buffer as RT-qPCR standards.Viral RNA Preparation and Titration Using E geneExtract viral RNA from debris-free culture media with QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit following manufacturer’s instructions.Aliquot viral RNA extract and store at -80 °C until use.Titrate cultured viral RNA copy number by RT-qPCRPrepare primer mix as follows: for 100 μl, mix 10 μl of forward and reverse primer, 5 μl of probe, 75 μl of DEPC treated water. Stock concentration of each primer/probe is 100 μM. Names and sequences of primers are listed in Table 1. Primer mix may be prepared in a batch and stored in -20 °C for later use.",
    "Prepare master mix except template as follow : 7.5 μl of Luna® Universal Probe One-Step Reaction Mix, 0.75 μl of Luna® WarmStart® RT Enzyme Mix, 0.6 μl of primer mix, and 4.15 μl of DEPC treated water per reaction.Aliquot 13 μl of master mix to each well of PCR tube or plate.Add 2 μl of template (viral RNA dilutions, in vitro transcribed RNA standards or no template control) to each well. Close lid of PCR tube or cover film on plate.Run PCR reaction as following temperature and time setting: 10 min at 55 °C, 1 min at 95 °C, and 45 cycles of 10 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C.Copy number of viral RNA can be calculated by substituting threshold cycle value (Ct) to the equation of standard curve of following form:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201029/20201029010249_2927.jpg Standard curve generation and sample copy number calculation can be done using each software coupled with real-time PCR instrument.RT-LAMP reactionTemplate viral RNA may prepared from cultured virus or biological specimen from COVID-19 patients. Selection of proper RNA extraction method is up to performers.Prepare 10x LAMP primer mix as follows: for 100 μl, mix 16 μl of FIP/BIP, 2 μl of F3/B3 primers, 4 μl of LF/LB primers and 56 μl of DEPC treated water. Stock concentration of each primers is 100 μM. Sequences of primers are listed in Table 1. The LAMP primer mix may be prepared in a batch and stored in -20 °C for later use.Prepare RT-LAMP reaction mix. Master mix except template can be prepared in a batch.For LCV method, Reaction components, stock concentration and volume to use are as listed in Table 2.When using WarmStart® Colorimetric LAMP 2X Master Mix, prepare reaction mix as follows: 2 μl of template, 1.5 μl of 10x LAMP primer mix, 0.",
    "3 μl of 20 μM SYTO9, 7.5 μl of LAMP mix, and 3.7 μl of DEPC treated water.Table 2.

Following example settings are for the LightCycler® 96 instrument SYTO 9 as fluorescent dye.Select SYBR Green I and set “Integration Time” to 1 s.Set cycling condition to 59 s at 65 °C for Nsp3_1-61 primer set or 69 °C for Nsp3_2-24 primer set. Use 65 °C for reaction with WarmStart® Colorimetric LAMP 2x Master Mix. Set 59 s of incubation time and 1 s of data acquisition time for each cycle to make actual incubation time per cycle as 1 min. Set number of cycles to the desired incubation time in minutes (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3804/bioprotoc-10-21-3804-g003.jpgFigure 3.
