    "1. Maintenance and Propagation of C2C12 Myoblasts\nPlate C2C12 myoblasts in a 75 cm2 flask and maintain cells in high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Serum (HG-DMEM) supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) to a final concentration of 10%. Do not allow cells to become confluent at any time as this will deplete the myoblastic population. Medium should be changed every other day. Note: always warm medium to 37 °C in a water bath prior to use.\nWhen myoblasts become approximately 80% confluent, passage cells to a new flask. Aspirate culture medium. Wash cells with 4-5 ml Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) to remove all traces of culture medium, which contains trypsin-inhibiting serum. Briefly rinse the cell layer with 2-3 ml 0.25% (w/v) trypsin-EDTA solution to dissociate the adherent myoblasts from the flask. Aspirate trypsin and place flask in incubator at 37 °C for 5 min.\nDuring this incubation, prepare a new flask with 9 ml of HG-DMEM/10% FBS medium. After trypsinization, add 10 ml of complete medium to cells and pipette 4-5 times to ensure collection of all cells in the medium. Add 1 ml of cell suspension to the new flask and incubate in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.\n2. C2C12 Cell Transfection\nOnce cells have reached 50% confluency, transfect according to manufacturer's instructions from Invitrogen. Briefly, combine 90 μl Lipofectamine 2000 reagent with 4.5 ml OPTI-MEM medium. In another tube, combine 36 μg CMV-trifusion reporter gene DNA with 4.5 ml OPTI-MEM. Flick each tube to combine and wait 5 min. Combine contents of both tubes, mix gently and incubate at room temperature for exactly thirty minutes. Note: A second flask should also be set up for untransfected cells that only receive Lipofectamine and OPTI-MEM to serve as a negative control.",
    "Remove medium from C2C12 cells and add 15.5 ml of fresh HG-DMEM/10%FBS medium. Add transfection medium to bring total volume to 20 ml.\nAllow cells to transfect overnight for at least 20 hr at 37 °C.\nNext day, aspirate transfection medium and add 10 ml HG-DMEM/10%FBS.\nView cells under an inverted fluorescent microscope. Capture both bright field and red fluorescence images (using a TRITC filter cube; mrfp ex/em: 584/607 nm). Count the number of RFP-expressing cells viewed under fluorescence divided by total number of cells viewed under bright field for multiple fields of view to generate transfection efficiency.\n3. Assessment of Cell Survivability/MTT Assay\nOne day prior to transfection, plate 1x105 C2C12 cells into each well in a 24-well plate. Cells should be plated in 500 μl volumes in HG-DMEM/10%FBS .\nNext day, transfect myoblasts overnight as previously described. Follow manufacturer's suggestions for transfection reagent volumes for a 24-well plate. Incubate a set of wells with Lipofectamine only (no DNA) as a control. View cells under fluorescence to ensure that proper transfection has occurred.\nRemove transfection medium and incubate myoblasts with 5 mg/ml thiazolyl blue tetrazolium bromide (MTT) in HG-DMEM/10% FBS. Add D-luciferin to eight of the transfected wells, and incubate at 37 °C for four hours.\nRemove medium from wells. Solubilize blue formazan crystals by adding 180 μl isopropanol to each well. Shake at 37 °C for 15 min.\nAvoiding any precipitate, pipette solution into a 96-well plate and read absorbance at 575 nm.\n4. Preparation of Myoblasts for Transplant\nRemove medium, wash myoblasts with HBSS, and trypsinize cells as outlined in 1.1.\nRe-suspend cells in 4 ml of complete medium.",
    "Using a hemocytometer, count cells to generate volumes containing 106 myoblasts. Pipette volume into sterile 1.5 ml microtubes. With a transfection efficiency of ~10%, these values indicate that 100,000 luciferase-expressing cells are detectable on the GE ExploreOptix scanner after transplant.\nAttain a final injection volume of 15 μl, containing 106 C2C12 cells. If necessary, centrifuge microtubes at 2,000 rpm for one minute. Carefully aspirate supernatant with a pipette. Re-suspend cells in 15 μl of HG-DMEM lacking FBS.\n5. Cell Implantation\nAnesthetize mouse with 2% isoflurane/2%O2. Pluck hair from the dorsal hind limb area. Maintain anesthesia at 1.5%isoflurane/2%O2.\nEnsure C2C12 myoblasts are well suspended. With the mouse in a prone position, extend the hind limb and use an insulin syringe to inject cells directly into the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle at a 30 ° angle. Inject transfected myoblasts into the right hind limb and untransfected myoblasts into the contralateral (left) hind limb.\nPerform a baseline bioluminescence scan: Quickly transfer mouse to stage in the optical scanner, laying the mouse in a prone position. Hook up the anesthetic line. To ensure the mouse remains anesthetized, a second person should be present to hook up the anesthetic line while the other places the animal in the scanner.\nGently extend the hind limb so the area of injection is visible. Tape hind limbs in place with a gentle adhesive such as medical tape.\nClose the chamber and ensure that no light can access the interior of the scanner, as this will increase the background signal detected. The scanner should be set to parameters included in your manufacturer's instructions for bioluminescence imaging. Specifically, ensure \"no laser\" is selected.\nDraw a region of interest (ROI) around the plucked area and start scan.\n6. Injection of Fluc Substrate, D-luciferin, into Mdx Mouse",
    "While the mouse is anesthetized intraperitoneally inject 150 mg/kg of firefly luciferase substrate, D-luciferin (from a 40 mg/ml stock solution, made up according to manufacturer's instructions).\nRecover mouse and allow a 15 min uptake period before preparing mouse for the next scan.\n7. BLI to Target Luc-expressing MPCs Following Implant into Mouse Models of DMD\nAfter the uptake period, anesthetize mouse again, as described in 5.1.\nTransfer the mouse back to the optical scanner and perform another bioluminescence scan in the same manner as the background scan.\nAlthough a 20 min uptake period should provide maximal signal intensity, a subsequent scan may be performed.\nUpon completion of image acquisition, sacrifice the mouse according to guidelines set by your Institutional Animal Ethics Committee and the Canadian Council on Animal Care (CCAC). Isolate hind limb muscle and place immediately in 10% formalin to fix for paraffin embedment. Perform immunohistochemistry staining for luciferase to confirm intramuscular injection of myoblasts.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
