    "1. Preexperimental expansion and passaging of cells\nC2C12 cell culture:\n\t\nPrepare 500 mL of C2C12 culture medium by combining Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin.\nThaw a vial of C2C12 cells in 37 °C water bath. While the C2C12 cells are thawing, add 5 mL of C2C12 medium to a 15 mL conical tube. Immediately transfer the thawed cells to the 15 mL tube using a P1000 pipette.\n\t\tNOTE: C2C12 cells are murine myoblast cells that have been previously used and validated as a primary cell line for modeling cardiomyoblast progenitors.\nGently mix C2C12 cells in the conical tube using a serological pipette. Then, add the entire volume of thawed cells in C2C12 medium (6 mL) to a 75 cm2 flask.\nAdd 6 mL of fresh C2C12 medium to the flask for a total volume of 12 mL. Gently rotate the flask such that the cell and media solution covers the entire bottom of the flask. Place the flask in a cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) to allow the cells to adhere.\nAllow the cells to expand in the incubator until they reach ~60% confluency.\n\t\tNOTE: This can be determined by periodically removing the cells from the incubator and quickly checking their confluency under a microscope. Be sure to minimize the time that cells are removed from the incubator.\nPassaging C2C12 cells:\n\t\nWarm the C2C12 medium, 500 mL of 1x PBS, and 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in a 37 °C water bath. After the reagents have been warmed, transfer all the reagents to the cell culture hood.\nBring the flask containing the C2C12 cells into the cell culture hood. Gently rinse the flask containing the C2C12 cells with warm 1x PBS twice.",
    "Tilt the flask at a 45° angle and aspirate the C2C12 medium with a glass pipette connected to vacuum suction. While maintaining a 45° angle, carefully add 10 mL of warm 1x PBS to the corner of the flask using a serological pipette. Lay the flask flat on the surface and gently move the flask in circular motions to ensure that the 1x PBS washes over the entire monolayer of cells.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Be careful not to disrupt the C2C12 monolayer while aspirating the medium.\nRemove the 1x PBS after the second wash. Add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to the flask, gently move the flask as described above to allow the trypsin-EDTA solution to spread over as much of the monolayer as possible and place the flask in the incubator for 2 min.\nAfter 2 min incubation, remove the flask from the incubator and gently tap it to detach any remaining cells.\nAdd 9 mL of C2C12 medium to the flask with a serological pipette to quench the trypsin. Using the serological pipette, gently rinse the cells with the medium and collect the 10 mL of trypsinized cell suspension. Add 10 mL of the cell suspension to a fresh 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 100 × g for 5 min.\nReturn the conical tube to the cell culture hood and remove the supernatant with a glass pipette connected to vacuum suction. While aspirating the supernatant, take care not to disrupt the cell pellet at the bottom of the conical tube. To do this, leave ~0.2 mL of the supernatant in the conical tube. Resuspend the cells in 10 mL of fresh C2C12 medium.",
    "For additional passaging, add 1 mL of the resuspended cells into a 75 cm2 flask. Add 11 mL of C2C12 medium to the flask with a serological pipette and place the flask in the incubator.\nSTO cell culture:\n\t\nPrepare STO culture medium by making 500 mL of DMEM with 7% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 2 nM L-glutamine.\nPrepare 0.1% gelatin by adding 0.5 g of gelatin powder to a bottle containing 500 mL of tissue-grade or autoclaved water. Add 7 mL of 0.1% gelatin solution to a 75 cm2 flask. Rotate the flask such that the gelatin solution covers the entire bottom of the flask. Let the flask incubate for 30 min at room temperature in the cell culture hood.\nFollowing 30 min incubation, remove the excess gelatin using a pipette connected to vacuum suction. Let the flasks remain in the incubator for another 30 min prior to use.\nThaw a vial of STO cells in a 37 °C water bath. Using a P1000 pipette, immediately transfer the thawed cells to a 15 mL conical tube containing 5 mL of freshly prepared STO culture medium.\n\t\tNOTE: STO cells are murine embryonic fibroblasts routinely used as feeder cells in cell culture protocols.\nGently mix the cells in the conical tube using a serological pipette. Add the entire volume (6 mL) of cells to a gelatin-coated 75 cm2 flask. Rotate the flask to ensure that the cell suspension is well distributed along the bottom of the flask.",
    "Add 6 mL of fresh STO medium to the flask for a total volume of 12 mL. Rotate the flask as described above to ensure that the cells and medium are well distributed along the bottom of the flask. Place the flask in the 37 °C incubator to allow the cells to adhere. Allow the cells to proliferate in the incubator until they reach ~60-70% confluency.\nPassaging STO cells:\n\t\nWarm STO cell medium, 1xPBS, and 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in a 37 °C water bath.\nGently rinse the flask containing STO cells with warm 1x PBS twice as described in step 1.2.2.1.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to the flask using a P1000 pipette. Place the flask in the 37 °C incubator for 5 min.\nAfter 5 min incubation, remove the flask from the incubator. Gently tap the flask to detach any adherent cells.\nAdd 9 mL of STO medium to the flask to quench the trypsin and collect the 10 mL of trypsinized cell suspension as described above. Add 10 mL of the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 100 × g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 10 mL of STO medium as described above. For additional passaging, add 1 mL of the resuspended cells into a 75 cm2 flask. Add 11 mL of STO medium, rotate the flask to ensure even distribution of the cells and medium along the bottom of the flask, and place the flask in the incubator.\nInactive STO cell culture and O9-1 cell basal medium preparation:\n\t\nPrepare O9-1 cell basal culture medium by mixing 500 mL of DMEM with 15% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 2 nM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM minimum nonessential amino acids, 1 nM sodium pyruvate, and 55 µM beta-mercaptoethanol.",
    "Prepare mitomycin C solution in 1x PBS at a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL by adding 4 mL of 1x PBS directly to a mitomycin C vial. Pipette the solution multiple times with a P1000 pipette. To further dissolve the mitomycin C in 1x PBS, place the vial on a vortex mixer or benchtop rocker for 45 min to 1 h.\nInactivate the STO cells by treating the STO plates with a final concentration of 0.01 mg/mL mitomycin C added to the standard STO medium. Place the STO plates inside the incubator for 2 h, taking care to protect the flask containing mitomycin C from light by minimizing the time spent outside the incubator. Following mitomycin treatment, wash the cells in 1x PBS twice as described in step 1.2.2.1.\n\t\tNOTE: Mitomycin C inhibits the proliferation of STO cells so that they can be used to generate conditioned medium over several days without becoming overconfluent in the flask.\nAfter removing the 1x PBS, add 12 mL of O9-1 basal culture medium to the inactivated STO cell cultures and incubate them for 24 h. Collect the conditioned, inactivated STO + O9-1 basal culture medium and place it in 50 mL conical tubes wrapped in foil to protect it from light.\nAdd 12 mL of fresh O9-1 basal culture medium to the inactivated STO cell cultures as described above. Repeat this step by adding fresh O9-1 basal culture medium to the same flanks containing the inactivated STO cells every 24 h.\n\t\tNOTE: Following mitomycin C treatment, the inactivated STO cells cannot proliferate; hence, the flasks containing the inactivated STO cells can be reused to generate conditioned medium.",
    "Store the foil-wrapped 50 mL conical tubes containing conditioned, inactivated STO + O9-1 basal culture medium at 4 °C until a total of 500 mL of the medium has been collected.\nO9-1 cell culture:\n\t\nPrepare O9-1 cell growth culture medium using 500 mL of conditioned STO + O9-1 basal medium, and add 103 units of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and 25 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (basic-FGF).\nPrepare 0.1% gelatin-coated flasks as described in steps 1.3.2-1.3.3.\nThaw a vial of O9-1 cells in a 37 °C water bath. Immediately transfer the thawed cells to a 15 mL conical tube containing 5 mL of freshly prepared O9-1 growth medium.\n\t\tNOTE: The O9-1 cell line is the only stable, multipotent neural crest cell line that has been generated from the mouse. This cell line is commonly used in neural crest in vitro experiments.\nGently mix the cells using a serological pipette. Add the entire 6 mL of cells to a gelatin-coated 75 cm2 flask.\nAdd 6 mL of O9-1 growth medium to the flask for a total volume of 12 mL. Place the flask in the 37 °C incubator to allow the cells to adhere. Allow the cells to proliferate in the incubator until they reach ~60-70% confluency.\nPassaging O9-1 cells:\n\t\nWarm O9-1 growth medium, 1x PBS, and 0.25% trypsin-EDTA in a 37 °C water bath.\nGently rinse the plate containing O9-1 cells with warm 1x PBS twice as described in step 1.2.2.1.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to the flask and place it in the 37 °C incubator for 5 min.\nAfter 5 min incubation, remove the flask from the incubator and tap the flask gently to detach any adherent cells.",
    "Add 9 mL of O9-1 growth medium to the flask to quench the trypsin. Collect 10 mL of the trypsinized cell suspension and add 10 mL of this cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge the tube at 100 × g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 10 mL of O9-1 growth medium. For additional passaging, add 1 mL of the resuspended cells to a 75 cm2 flask. Add 11 mL of O9-1 growth medium and place the flask containing the cells in 12 mL of medium in the 37 °C incubator.\n2. Plating cells in a coculture system\nPlating C2C12 cell chambers:\n\t\nFollowing trypsinization (as described in step 1.2), resuspend the C2C12 cell pellet in 10 mL of C2C12 medium. Dilute the cells in a 1:20 ratio in C2C12 medium by removing 0.5 mL of the resuspended C2C12 cells and adding them to a new 15 mL conical tube containing 9.5 mL of fresh C2C12 medium. Gently mix the suspension with a serological pipette.\nAdd 1 mL of the 1:20-diluted C2C12 cells to each well of a new 4-chambered well using a P1000 pipette and place the 4-chambered well in the incubator.\nPlating O9-1 cell inserts:\n\t\nFollowing trypsinization, resuspend the O9-1 cell pellet in 10 mL of O9-1 growth medium. Dilute the cells in a 1:20 ratio in O9-1 growth medium by removing 0.5 mL of the resuspended C2C12 cells and adding them to a new 15 mL conical tube containing 9.5 mL of fresh O9-1 growth medium. Gently mix the suspension with a serological pipette.\nPlace a single permeable insert (see the Table of Materials) inside each well of a new 4-chambered well filled with 1 mL of O9-1 growth medium.",
    "NOTE: This 4-chambered well should be different from that containing the C2C12 cells from step 2.1.3.\nAdd 300 µL of the diluted O9-1 cell suspension to each insert using a P1000 pipette. Ensure that the bottom of each insert is submerged within the well filled with 1.3 mL of O9-1 growth medium. Place the well in the 37 °C incubator.\n(Optional). Perform siRNA knockdown in the O9-1 cells or C2C12 cells.\n\t\nPerform gene knockdown by siRNA 18-24 h after plating either O9-1 cell inserts or C2C12 cell chamber wells.\n\t\t\nDilute the siRNA and transfection reagent in reduced-serum medium (see the Table of Materials) according to the manufacturers' recommendations and the desired concentrations for the experiment. Gently mix the diluted siRNA and transfection reagent (1:1) and incubate the mixture at room temperature for 7 min.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In this protocol, 50 nM concentrations were used as this siRNA concentration was determined to result in sufficient knockdown of target gene expression.\nAdd the siRNA-lipid complexes to either the O9-1 cell inserts or the C2C12 cell chamber wells as determined by the experimental design and incubate the cells with the siRNA-lipid complexes for ~36-48 h.\n3. Performing wound assay and quantitatively assessing myoblast migration\nWound assay:\n\t\nAllow the O9-1 cell inserts and C2C12 cell chamber wells to adhere and proliferate in the incubator until both cells are at ~70-80% confluency before proceeding with this portion of the protocol. If cells grow >90% confluent, do not proceed with the scratch assay, as cells will merely detach from the well.\nWarm 1x PBS and C2C12 medium by placing them in a 37 °C water bath.\nRemove supernatant medium from the C2C12 chamber well and wash the cells once with 1x PBS. Remove the 1x PBS and immediately scratch the cells with a sterile P10 pipette tip.",
    "Pass the sterile P10 pipette tip firmly in a single direction to span the entire length or width of the cell monolayer (e.g., right to left, top to bottom). Be sure to scratch each well containing cells only once.\n\t\t\tNOTE: To optimize scratching results, scratch wells of different experimental conditions at a similar level of confluency. To do this, ensure that each 4-chambered well has cells for each required experimental condition (e.g., well #1 negative control, well #2 positive control). In addition, use a new sterile P10 pipette for each scratch and apply a similar amount of force to the pipette each time. Do not attempt to create more than one scratch in each well.\nAfter scratching, quickly add 1 mL of 1x PBS back into the well using a P1000 pipette tip. Repeat this process for each well that will be scratched.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Given the variability associated with each scratch, it is recommended that multiple wells (n = 3) are used for wound creation in each experimental condition. Work expeditiously as it is critical to minimize the duration for which the cells are without 1x PBS during these steps. After removing 1x PBS from each well, one should not take more than 5 s to generate a wound in each well.\nAfter generating a wound and adding 1x PBS back into each well, image the scratch using a brightfield inverted microscope and use this image as the baseline wound size (time 0). To take images, perform the following steps:\n\t\t\nTurn on the computer and the microscope (see the Table of Materials) by pressing the power button. Place the chamber slide on the stage and rotate the objective dial to 5x magnification.",
    "Open the imaging software (see the Table of Materials) by double-clicking the software icon on the computer desktop. Click the Camera tab on the software home screen. Click the Live button to visualize the cells on the AxioCam IC tab.\nEnsure that the light filter is pulled all the way out to allow light to pass to the camera and computer screen. Manually move and/or rotate the chamber slide to position the wound area in the center of the live image on the AxioCam IC tab.\nTo take images, click snap to open a new tab next to the AxioCam IC tab that contains the image.\nTo save this still image, click file on the top left of the software home page | save as | enter the file name in the file name box. Save the figure in Carl Zeiss image (*.czi) format (the default setting), and select desktop on the bar on the left to save the file to the desktop as a .czi file, which can only be opened in the Zen lite 2012 software program.\nTo save the picture as a .tiff, click file | save as | enter file name in the file name box. Save the figure as tagged image file (*.tiff) by clicking the save as type button and selecting *.tiff from the dropdown menu.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The .tiff format can be opened in any image processing software.\nManually reposition the chamber slide to take 2-3 more images at other points of the wound in the same well.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In total, this will result in 3-4 non-overlapping, high-magnification images of the wound in each well.\nRemove the 1x PBS from each well and add 1 mL of C2C12 medium.",
    "NOTE: Be cautious not to pipette too aggressively when removing or adding solutions to the chamber well following wound generation, as this may cause cells to detach from the chamber well. In addition, tilt the chamber well so that aspiration and reintroduction of solutions can be done at the corners of each well to minimize cell monolayer disruption.\nAssemble the well insert coculture system by manually placing the inserts containing the O9-1 cells in each well of the chamber well. Gently push the inserts down into the well such that the bottom of the insert sits just above the underlying C2C12 cells. Return the well insert constructs to the incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not allow the bottom of the insert to physically touch and mechanically disrupt the underlying C2C12 cells.\nAllow the cells to migrate for a total of 9-12 h. To determine the optimal migration time, check the cells at 6 h following wound creation, then every 2-3 h thereafter. End the experiment when the cells in control or positive control conditions begin to completely cover the wound.\n\t\t​NOTE: Given the non-contact nature of the construct, the overlying insert does not need to be removed from the wells when checking interval migration progression. Migratory variability will be observed depending on factors such as the cell types used in this assay, cellular density at the time of wound generation, the width of the wound created, and experimental conditions of manipulated cells (e.g., gene knockdown, recombinant protein addition). Concentrations of these reagents should be determined experimentally with guidance from manufacturer recommendations.\n4. Immunofluorescence staining and imaging of migrating myoblasts\nTerminating the migration assay and deconstructing the well insert system:",
    "Remove the O9-1 cell inserts after a 9-12 h migration period (or alternative time designated by experimental conditions). Carefully aspirate the C2C12 medium using a P1000 pipette. Add 0.5 mL of 1x PBS to the chamber wells, and take final images of cells following migration.\nCarefully aspirate all 0.5 mL of 1x PBS mixed with medium and remove the plastic chambers from the chamber wells using kit instructions, leaving the underlying slide containing the C2C12 cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Be careful not to disrupt the C2C12 cells adherent to the slide when removing the chamber wells.\nPerforming immunostaining:\n\t\nImmediately place the slide in a slide holder containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Pour out the 4% PFA and add 0.1% Triton X-100-containing 1x PBS (1x PBST) to the slide holder to wash the slide for 15 min at room temperature. Pour out the 1x PBST and add 1x PBS to the slide holder to wash the slide for 10 min at room temperature. Repeat this step once more for a total of two 1x PBS washes.\nRemove the slide from the slide holder. Trace the outer edges of the slide with a hydrophobic pen to create a hydrophobic boundary around the slide to prevent solutions from spilling from the slide. Take care not to disrupt the adherent cells.\nAdd 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) blocking solution (diluted in 1x PBS) to the slide (~0.5 mL per slide). Ensure that the solution is contained within the hydrophobic boundary created in step 4.2.4. Incubate the slide for 1 h at room temperature in a humidified slide chamber.\n\t\tNOTE: Although BSA blocking is not required for phalloidin immunostaining, this step in the protocol allows for coupling with fluorescence antibody staining.",
    "After blocking for 1 h, pour out the blocking solution from the slide, add phalloidin antibody (diluted to 1:200 in 1% BSA blocking solution by adding 5 µL of the antibody to 995 µL of BSA solution) to the slide and incubate at 4 °C overnight. Again, ensure that the solution is contained within the hydrophobic boundary created in step 4.2.4. Given that the phalloidin antibody is conjugated to Alexa Fluor-488 dye, minimize light exposure of the antibody reagent before and after adding to the slide.\nThe following day, place the slide in a slide holder protected from light exposure (e.g., wrap the slide holder in foil or use a non-transparent slide holder). Wash the cells in the slide holder with 1x PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Repeat the wash for a total of three 10 min washes.\nAdd 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-containing mounting medium and mount the slides with glass coverslips. Image the cells that have migrated using a standard fluorescence microscope.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
