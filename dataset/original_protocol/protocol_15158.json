    "1. Animal Preparation and Application of the Spine Stabilizer\nThe mouse cervical spine is concave ventrally as seen from the lateral view. The spinous processes from C3 to T1 are small and friable and, therefore, are not suitable for vertebral stabilization as commonly described 3,4. We recommend that spine stabilization be performed by lateral facet fixation. The fixation device consists of a U-shaped metal channel to support the mouse and two adjustable stainless steel arms that clamp to each facet laterally. This provides excellent immobilization of the target vertebra. After spinal fixation, the spine is slightly elevated to flatten the cervical spine curvature to provide better exposure of the spinal cord.\nSterilize the following surgical instruments: 2-3 pairs of forceps, 2 pairs of microscissors, a 30 G needle, suture and needle holder, skin clips, and clip applicator. Disinfect the spine stabilizer. Anesthetize the mouse using an intraperitoneal cocktail of Ketamine/Xylazine (100 mg / 10 mg/kg). Shave the hair from the mouse's neck.\nAfter skin cleansing with a povidone-iodine solution and 70% alcohol, move the mouse onto the operating table warmed with a heating pad. Cover the animal's eyes with ophthalmic ointment to prevent corneal drying.\nAfter induction of anesthesia (reached when the mouse does not respond to a tail pinch), make a posterior cervical midline skin incision from the occiput to the subcutaneous fat-pad of the lower cervical spine. Under magnification, perform a midline incision between the trapezius muscles at C2 and split the semispinalis capitis muscles. Identification of the submuscular fat pad facilitates dissection in the correct layer.\nExtend the midline muscle dissection caudally to the T2 spinous process which serves as a reliable landmark. Cut the muscles attached to the T2 vertebra and remove the cartilaginous portion of the T2 spinous process.",
    "Dissect the paraspinal muscles from the C2 through the T2 laminae using a pair of micro-scissors. Muscle dissection begins adjacent to the spinous processes and extends bilaterally to the facet joints. Separate the muscles immediately adjacent to the spinous processes and laminae (in the periosteal layer) to minimize bleeding. After the lateral facets are exposed, place the mouse on the U-shaped channel of the LISA stage.\nAttach the stainless steel arms beneath the exposed facets bilaterally. Once the arms are in place, tighten the thumb screws of the steel arms to immobilize the spine. This maintains firm fixation of the target vertebra and provides excellent exposure. The arms can be adjusted to provide precise horizontal orientation of the spine.\nIncise the ligamentum flavum between C5 and C6 to expose underlying dura. Between the interlaminar space, use a 30 G needle to create a small durotomy through which microscissors are placed to extend the durotomy. The spinal cord is now prepared to undergo the controlled laceration lesion.\n2. Cervical Spinal Cord Laceration Using the LISA Device\nThe width of the cervical spinal cord enlargement varies at different levels. Make a dorsal hemisection lesion at C5-6 using a 2.3 mm flat blade and set the amplitude of vibration to cover the entire width of the spinal cord. Blades are obtained from Fine Science Tools Inc. (Foster City, CA) and modified for spinal cord laceration. Maintain the amplitude of the blade oscillation at ≥ 0.5 mm, as lower amplitude levels will diminish the ease of cord laceration.\nPosition the spine stabilizer and mouse on the LISA stage. The blade is attached to the LISA with its position controlled by micro-drivers capable of three ranges of motion. Components of the LISA and their functions are described in Figure 1.",
    "Power the blade-vibrating switch on. Under magnification, move the mouse so that the exposed spinal cord is positioned directly beneath the vibrating blade.\nElevate the stage supporting the mouse towards the oscillating blade. The \"0\" position is recorded when the blade barely touches the dorsal vein of the spinal cord. Measure the depth of the spinal cord laceration relative to the \"0\" position.\nElevate the stage position by micro-driver control: a 360° turn of the micro-driver knob elevates the stage by 0.25 mm. Thus, a 0.75 mm dorsal hemisection lesion is created by turning the micro-driver knob 3 times. The accuracy of the lesion is ± 0.01 mm. As the blade begins to lacerate the spinal cord, lubricate the surgical field with saline irrigation. The cutting depth of the spinal cord is controlled by the vertical micro-driver and is independent of visual guidance.\nOnce the predetermined depth has been reached, turn the vibrating switch off. Ideally, the oscillating blade is positioned in the lesion gap without evidence of tissue deformation. Lower the stage from the cutting blade and remove the blood and saline from the surgical field using cotton Q-tips. Hemostasis occurs spontaneously in < 1 min.\nRelease the mouse from the spine stabilizer. Approximate the paraspinal muscles using 6-0 silk suture and close the skin wound using stainless steel Michel clips.\n3. Animal Care\nSubcutaneously inject a total of 1-2 ml saline to maintain adequate hydration and place the mouse in the recovery cage on a heating pad while regaining consciousness.\nProvide water and soft food ad lib and administer analgesics for 48 hours post-operatively. There is no need for bladder care following dorsal hemisection of the spinal cord."
