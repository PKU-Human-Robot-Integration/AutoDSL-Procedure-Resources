    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol was developed specifically for isolation of hepatic macrophages and downstream use in diverse next-generation sequencing technologies. Conceptually this framework can easily be extended for other liver non-parenchymal cells (NPCs) including sinusoidal endothelial cells, stellate cells, or alternative lineages of immune cells.\nModule 1: preparation of hepatic Kupffer cells (or other NPCs)\nTiming: >10 h\nLiver tissue is enzymatically digested in situ to generate a single-cell suspension enriched for liver non-parenchymal cells that are then immunolabeled for fluorescence-activated cells sorting (FACS). The protocol for preparing non-parenchymal cells was optimized from several other available protocols (Mederacke et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Movita et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Seki et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Excellent protocols with videos detailing the procedure for perfusion-based digestion of a mouse liver exist and can be referred to (Charni-Natan and Goldstein, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Mederacke et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nNote: The protocol benefits from two people working in parallel if processing more than four mice. Mouse dissection and digestion is time-consuming and delays at this stage can affect sample quality.\nPrepare necessary buffers and reagents\nTiming: 30–60 min\nIn this section, necessary buffers for are made ready for non-parenchymal cell preparations.\nFreshly prepare the following solutions on the same day:\n1 mM flavopiridol: dilute 10 mM aliquot of flavopiridol stock to 1 mM using water. Do not use phosphate buffered saline as this can cause a precipitate to form. Store the 1 mM solution on ice and discard at the end of the day.",
    "Critical: Tissue digestion leads to cell stress responses and the potential for confounding changes in measured analytes. To minimize the effect of tissue digestion on profiled transcriptional regulators, the RNA polymerase inhibitor flavopiridol is added to perfusion and digestion steps where the hepatic cells are at 37°C and active. Use of flavopiridol can affect the viability of purified cells in culture though and it can be excluded or titrated as appropriate for experimental purposes. For comparison of genomics data though, the digestion protocol used should not be altered.\nWash buffer 1: store and use at 4°C or on ice. The below table is adequate for 8 mice. Discard at the end of the day.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_513_2.csv\nWash buffer 2: store and use at 4°C or on ice. The below table is adequate for 16 mice. Discard within 1 week.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_513_3.csv\nIsotonic Percoll. Percoll must be made isotonic. Mixing 90% Percoll with 10% 10× Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (no calcium, no magnesium, no phenol red) renders the solution safe for use with cells. Store the solution on ice and discard at the end of the day.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_513_4.csv\nLiberase TM (5 mg/mL). Prepare and store on ice. Do not vortex or vigorously pipette! Immediately freeze unused enzyme at −80°C in single use aliquots (1.25 mL per healthy mouse liver).\nCritical: The enzyme blend Liberase TM is preferable to sequential digestion with Pronase and Collagenase. This preference is due to improved reproducibility in tissue digestion quality and reduced loss of surface antigens used in subsequent FACS purification that are cleaved by Pronase (examples: CD31 and Tim4).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_513_5.csv\nLiver clearing buffer. Store and use at 37°C. The below table is adequate for 8 mice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_513_6.csv\nLiver digestion buffer A. Store and use at 37°C.",
    "Critical: Collagenases require calcium to function. Do not use Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution not containing calcium or magnesium.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_513_7.csv\nLiver digestion buffer B. Prepare immediately prior to euthanizing a group of mice. Prepare 60 mL per mouse, or 80 mL if the liver is expected to be enlarged or diseased.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_513_8.csv\nOptiPrep (28%): OptiPrep is a commercially available iso-osmolar solution of iodixanol (60%) and water. With this solution, the final iodixanol concentration is 16.8%. Prepare 10 mL per liver and store at 4°C or on ice. Discard at the end of the day.\nCritical: Mix the OptiPrep stock solution prior to use. It has a tendency to settle.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_513_9.csv\nPBS + 0.1% Tween 20: Prepare 50 mL by adding 50 μL of 10% Tween 20 to 50 mL PBS. Store on ice or at 4°C for 1 week.\nDigestion and removal of liver tissue\nTiming: 4–5 h\nIn this section, mouse livers are digested in situ, excised, then further digested in vitro. Following digestion, non-parenchymal cells from the crude cell preparation are enriched by successive washing and centrifugation, as well as density gradient centrifugation.\nFlush blood from the liver of a mouse freshly euthanized following institutional approved guidelines.\nPin down the mouse and carefully open the abdominal cavity.\nGently move the intestines to the side exposing the inferior vena cava and the portal vein.\nInsert a 24-gauge catheter into the inferior vena (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Attach the line of a peristalsis pump connected to a 0.22-μm filter to the catheter and pin into place. Nick the portal vein with scissors to release fluid pressure. Close the inferior vena cava above the diaphragm using a bulldog clamp. Pin the lines in place at the filter (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/513-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Catheter placement for fluid perfusion through the mouse inferior vena cava",
    "(A) Example of successful insertion of a catheter into the inferior vena cava. Often the catheter hub will fill with blood. If it does not, it is sometimes helpful to apply a slight vacuum using a 1 mL syringe.\n(B) Example of an ongoing successful perfusion. The catheter and peristalsis lines are secured by pinning the filter in place on the dissection mount (Styrofoam board). Note the blanched appearance of the liver in comparison to (A) as a result of blood evacuation through the portal vein.\nNote: All lobes of the liver should blanch (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) as erythrocytes drain from the organ. If the liver is not blanching, carefully adjust the position of the catheter in the vessel.\nApply a small amount of surgical glue to hold the catheter securely in place. Alternatively, the catheter can be secured using a suture.\nTurn on the heat lamp to maintain liver temperature at around 37°C, which is ideal for enzymatic digestion.\nPerfuse with liver clearing buffer for 3 min at flow rate of 5 mL/min.\nDigest liver tissue in situ.\nNote: Enlarged fatty livers and fibrotic livers may require a higher flow rate and increased digestion volume (60 mL at 7 mL/min). This is described in the troubleshooting section.\nMove the pump intake line to a tube with 40 mL of liver digestion buffer B and allow the contents to perfuse through the liver until the line is empty. The liver should begin to lose its shape during digestion, and the Glisson’s capsule may start to detach from the liver cells.\nRemove the gallbladder using scissor and tweezers, the gallbladder contains digestive enzymes that can digest surface markers used for FACS.\nContinue digestion of liver tissue in vitro.",
    "At this point the liver is now often “mush” and can be removed from the abdominal cavity by aspirating into a 1 mL syringe. Alternatively, remove the lobes with scissors and forceps and finely mince the tissue using a razor blade. Transfer the digested contents into a 50 mL conical filled with 20 mL of liver digestion buffer B. Refer to Troubleshooting for more details.\nMix digested liver tissue with digestion buffer by pipetting up and down 3–5 times or by gentle inversion of tubes.\nIncubate digested liver tissue for 20 min at 37°C with Miltenyi MACSmix tube rotator at the highest speed.\nRemove hepatocytes from cell suspension by low-speed centrifugation followed by Percoll centrifugation.\nNote: If working with a fatty liver then perform the centrifugations described in this step at 20°C–25°C.\nNote: The Percoll wash (step 4) can be skipped if the liver is healthy and non-steatotic, instead simply centrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet non-parenchymal cells. Furthermore, the Percoll wash depletes stellate cells. If stellate cells are desired, then skip the Percoll wash and simply centrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min to pellet non-parenchymal cells.\nFilter 20 mL of cells suspended in liver digestion buffer through a 70 μM cell strainer into a 50 mL conical to remove undigested debris and connective tissue.\nAdd 20 mL of wash buffer 1 to dilute liver digestion buffer and slow enzymatic activity during hepatocyte removal.\nSediment the dense hepatocytes by low-speed centrifugation at 50 × g for 3 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 50 mL conical and repeat spin at 50 × g for 3 min at 4°C and discard the pellet containing hepatocytes.\nTransfer the supernatant enriched for NPCs to a new 50 mL conical.",
    "Add 10 mL isotonic Percoll to 40 mL cell suspension. If the volume of cell suspension is less than 40 mL at this step adjust amount of isotonic Percoll that is added to maintain a 20% final concentration of Percoll.\nCentrifuge cell suspension in 20% Percoll at 600 × g for 10 min 4°C.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend NPCs in 20 mL of wash buffer 1.\nIsolate NPCs using OptiPrep gradient centrifugation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/513-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Setup of the OptiPrep density gradient\n(A) Depiction of how to set up the gradient underlay.\n(B) An example of a prepared gradient prior to centrifugation.\n(C) Depiction of the resulting gradient layers after centrifugation. Collect the desired NPC layers by pipetting and discard the debris fraction. It can be helpful to assess a small portion of debris layer by flow cytometry if the yields for the desired cell population are consistently lower than expected. This could necessitate optimization of the gradient percentages.\nCreated with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nCentrifuge the NPC cell suspension at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet NPCs once more.\nResuspend pellet in 10 mL of OptiPrep (28%) using a 10 mL syringe with an 18-gauge needle attached (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Take care to resuspend the cell pellet gently at this step.\nFill a 15 mL conical with 3 mL of wash buffer 1 and rest a glass Pasteur pipette at the bottom of the tube. Transfer the 10 mL cell suspension in OptiPrep buffer through the Pasteur pipette to create the cell layer underneath the less dense wash buffer 1 layer (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B). The narrow opening of the Pasteur pipette controls the flow rate and greatly simplifies the layering process.",
    "Centrifuge gradient suspension at 1,400 × g for 25 min at 4°C with centrifuge acceleration set to very low and with brake mechanism turned off.\nFollowing gradient centrifugation, non-parenchymal cells will be enriched at the interface between the upper 0% OptiPrep layer and the lower 28% OptiPrep layer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Use a 1 mL pipette tip to extract all cells at this interface and transfer to a new 15 mL conical tube, then fill the tube to 12 mL with wash buffer 2.\nLyse red blood cells remaining in non-parenchymal cell mixture.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend in 1 mL of 4°C RBC lysis buffer, incubate for 5 min on ice to lyse red blood cells.\nDilute the RBC lysis buffer cell suspension with 9 mL of 4°C phosphate buffered saline and pellet NPCs via centrifugation at 400 × g for 7 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and wash the cells with 10 mL of 4°C phosphate buffered saline.\nStaining of non-parenchymal cells\nTiming: 1.5 h\nIn this section, the enriched non-parenchymal cells are labeled with fluorescent antibodies in preparation for FACS.\nStain non-parenchymal cells with viability dye. Set aside some unstained cells which can be helpful for determining background fluorescence.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nResuspend cell pellet in 250 to 500 μL of 4°C PBS containing anti-CD16/CD32 to block FC and Live/Dead NIR Viability Dye or similar to label dead cells.\nNote: A 250 μL stain volume per healthy liver is often appropriate for steps 8b and 9. Enlarged fatty livers may require a 500 μL stain volume.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_513_10.csv\nStain at 4°C for 10 min.\nFreshly prepare 250 to 500 μL of the antibody staining cocktail per liver.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_513_11.csv",
    "Note: Many excellent alternative antibody cocktails may be used. We refer the readers to the literature for examples (Devisscher et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Ramachandran et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Remmerie et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Seidman et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nAdd an equivalent volume used in step 8b of the 2× antibody staining cocktail to the cells. Mix together by inversion 20 times or using gentle flicking.\nStain at 4°C for 20 min.\nFill the tube with wash buffer 2 at the end of the staining process.\nPellet the NPCs by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C, remove the supernatant, then resuspend pellet in 2 mL wash buffer 2.\nFilter the cells through a 35- or 40-μm cell strainer to remove particulate matter that may clog the cell sorter. Flush the strainer with wash buffer 2, then fill the tube with wash buffer 2.\nPellet the non-parenchymal cell suspension at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend in 500 μL wash buffer 2. Keep the cells on ice and in the dark (covered). Cells are now ready for FACS.\nSorting of non-parenchymal cells\nTiming: 1–3 h to sort through an entire preparation of one liver\nIn this section, the stained single-cell suspension is sorted into purified cell populations using FACS.\nPrepare single-color controls using compensation beads. We use OneComp eBeads Compensation Beads sourced from Invitrogen. Follow the manufacturer’s protocol. Typically, using 1–2 μg of antibody per compensation control provides necessary fluorescent signal higher than the signal of stained cells. Of note, we have found the popular UltraComp eBeads Compensation Beads are not easily detected by this lab’s MoFlo Astrios or Sony MA900. Yet, these beads are an excellent option for use on BD systems.",
    "Set a gating strategy for Kupffer cells (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). We have found success with the following strategy:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/513-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Gating strategy for purification of mouse hepatic macrophages and sinusoidal endothelial cells\nRepresentative flow cytometry gating to isolate Kupffer cells. The cells displayed here are from a mouse fed a NASH-inducing diet and display two population of Kupffer cells that can be segregated based on expression of Tim4. High expression of Tim4 is a useful surrogate for determine cells of long-term residence or embryonic origin (Devisscher et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Sakai et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Scott et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Seidman et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nGenerate a dot plot of CD45 versus CD146 and set gates for CD146−CD45+ immune cells and CD146+CD45− endothelial cells.\nGenerate a dot plot CD11b versus F4/80 for the CD146−CD45+ population identified in step 20a. Set gate for CD11bloF4/80hi tissue macrophages.\nGenerate a dot plot of side scatter pulse height versus side scatter pulse area to identify single cells and exclude doublets. Doublet particles will have an increased ratio of area signal relative to height signal. It is also acceptable to identify singlets in an analogous manner using forward scatter.\nGenerate a dot plot of forward scatter versus Zombie NIR to identify live cells and exclude dead cells. Live cells will be Zombie NIR negative.\nNote: It is helpful to use a fluorescence minus one control for Zombie NIR to define your viable cell gate.\nGenerate a dot plot of Tim4-A647. Tim4+ cells are long-term resident or embryonic-derived Kupffer cells while Tim4− cells are monocyte-derived macrophages recruited during disease to the Kupffer cell niche.\nOptional: Set gating strategy for other hepatic macrophages which may arise during the course of a chosen disease model.\nSelect the CD11bhiF4/80lo population displayed in step 11b.\nSelect CX3CR1+Ly6G− cells to exclude neutrophils.",
    "These cells can be further divided based on expression of Ly6C into Ly6Clo recruited macrophages and Ly6Chi recruited macrophages.\nIdentify singlets and live cells as in step 18c and 18d.

Further clarification on identification of these cells is described in Sakai et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12].\nOptional: Set gating strategy for stellate cells.\nGenerate a plot of retinoid autofluorescence versus side scatter to identify autofluorescent stellate cells.\nIdentify singlets and live cells as in step 18c and 18d. Further clarification on identification of these cells is described in Kisseleva et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] and Mederacke et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6].\nNote: In our experience detection of retinoid autofluorescence is best when excited by an ultraviolet (355 nm) laser and detected at approximately 500 nm.\nPurity of sorted cells can be assessed by flow cytometry of a small number of sorted cells diluted in wash buffer 2.\nStorage of sorted non-parenchymal cells\nFACS-purified cell populations are now suitable for many next-generation sequencing applications. We provide example storage strategies for RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq below. Our labs have also successfully used cells prepared in this manner for scRNA-seq and Hi-C as examples of other suitable applications.\nOptional: To prepare cells for RNA-seq, we recommend using 50,000 - 100,000 cells for common RNA-seq library preparation protocols. Cells can be processed as recommended using a supplied lysis buffer found in many commercial RNA-seq kits or alternatively with Trizol.",
    "Optional: To prepare cells for ATAC-seq, we recommend using 50,000 cells (Buenrostro et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Corces et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Of note, sample preparation and tagmentation reaction conditions may require optimization for each cell type to yield the best quality data.\nPrepare sorted viable cells for ChIP-seq. We recommend starting with 0.5 to 1 million cells for ChIP-seq library preparation. For Kupffer cells, this can often be attained with 1–3 livers. For sinusoidal endothelial cells, this can be often be attained with 1 liver. Other populations of non-parenchymal cells would require testing to determine necessary sample size. This approach works well for assessment of histone modifications and genomic PU.1 occupancy. Other ChIP targets may require optimization.\nWash the desired number of cells with wash buffer 2 and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend pellet in 500 μL wash buffer 2 and transfer to 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tube. Wash the starting tube with an additional 500 μL wash buffer 2 and combine into the 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tube.\nCentrifuge the cells in the 1.5 mL DNA LoBind tube at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend the pellet in 20°C–25°C 1% formaldehyde using approximately 1 million cells per mL. Incubate for 10 min 20°C–25°C with gentle rocking or rotation to cross link proteins and DNA.\nQuench the cross-linking reaction by adding 20°C–25°C glycine to a final 0.125 M concentration from the 2.625 M glycine stock solution. Additionally, add Tween 20 to a final 0.1% concentration from a 10% Tween 20 stock. Tween 20 aids in pelleting the cross-linked cells during centrifugation.",
    "Centrifuge cross-linked cells at 800 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Carefully confirm the presence of a cell pellet. If a pellet is not apparent, centrifuge again at 1,200 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Aspirate the supernatant taking care to avoid disturbing the cell pellet.\nSuspend the cross-linked cells in 1 mL PBS + 0.1% Tween 20 at 4°C and centrifuge at 800–1,200 × g for 10 min at 4°C, as in step 28. Aspirate the supernatant taking care to avoid disturbing the cell pellet.\nWash the cells once more by repeating step 29.\nQuickly centrifuge the sample for a few seconds at 800–1,200 × g collect the residual fluid to the tube bottom. Aspirate as much residual supernatant as possible using a p10 pipette tip. Be very careful to avoid disturbing the cell pellet. Left over liquid in the sample at this step will crystallize at −80°C and can interfere with ChIP-seq library quality.\nSnap-freeze the pellet using liquid nitrogen and store the cross-linked cells at −80°C until ready for ChIP-seq library preparation described by Texari et al. (link to “An optimized protocol for rapid, sensitive, and robust on-bead ChIP-seq”). Alternatively, the samples can be snap-frozen using an alcohol and dry ice bath. Take care to protect the tube labeling!",
    "Note: It can be beneficial for challenging ChIPs to double crosslink the sample at 20°C–25°C with gentle rocking for 30 min using 1 mL of a 2 mM solution of disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) per million cells. Then add formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% and incubate for an additional 10 min of 20°C–25°C incubation. More details on this approach can be found in the linked protocol described by Texari et al. (link to “An optimized protocol for sensitive and robust on-bead ChIP-seq”). However, in our experience much higher quality ChIP-seq data for more challenging ChIP factors can be obtained through use of nuclei fixed in situ prior to fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting. This approach is described in the next section.\nModule 2, alternative strategy: in situ fixation and isolation of nuclei from Kupffer cells (or other liver cells)\nThis section describes an approach for preparing nuclei from fixed livers for sorting that was optimized from other protocols (Nott et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). We have found that using around 1 million Kupffer cell nuclei prepared in this manner yield higher quality ChIP-seq data than material from Module 1. This is particularly true for transcription factors that are challenging to ChIP with limited material. Examples of the data quality can be found in Sakai et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] and Seidman et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14].\nPrepare buffers and reagents necessary for module 2\nTiming: 1 h\nIn this section, the buffers needed for in situ fixation are prepared.\nFreshly prepare 25 mL liver clearing buffer 2 per mouse liver and store at 20°C–25°C.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_513_12.csv\nFreshly prepare 180 mL 1 mg/mL DSG per mouse liver.\nDissolve 100 mg vials of DSG using 4 mL of DMSO.",

The goal by this step is to have sufficiently cleaned the pellet of debris yielding a clear supernatant. Removing this debris is beneficial to reduce the frequency of clogging the cell sorter and the overall time spent sorting. A cleaner starting sample will also result in increased sort purity and yield.\nExamine nuclei under a microscope using trypan blue and a hemocytometer.

    "Pause Point: At this point, nuclei can be suspended in 10 mL 90% FBS and 10% DMSO (10 mL per liver) and aliquots stored at −80°C for downstream processing at a later time. We have not tested other nuclei preservation methods. To recover the cryopreserved sample, warm the frozen suspension at 37°C in a water bath, then wash the nuclei twice with nuclei isolation buffer.\nNote: At this time nuclei can be stained for nuclear antigens specific for the population of interest. For the purpose of this protocol, we use fluorescence signal provided genetically via nuclear-localized tdTomato of the Clec4f-Cre-Reporter (Sakai et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) which is available at Jackson labs under Stock No: 033296. As shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], Kupffer cell nuclei can also be enriched at the steady state by staining the nuclei with anti-PU.1. We describe this procedure in the optional step below. This concept can be extended to labeling of other populations with lineage-specific antibodies.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/513-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Gating strategy for purification of mouse hepatic Kupffer cell nuclei\nRepresentative flow cytometry gating for isolation of Kupffer cell nuclei. The use of a Clec4f nuclear reporter is necessary to ensure separation of Kupffer cell nuclei from nuclei of other PU1+ recruited macrophages that can arise during disease. At the steady state, there are very few recruited macrophages in the liver isolation of Kupffer cell nuclei using PU1 staining alone is adequate.\nNote: Liver disease can promote population expansion of many cell lineages, especially myeloid cells. In these instances, purification of nuclei by labeling with a single antibody may not result in a consistent nuclei population. During disease, we suggest considering genetically encoded drivers of nuclear-localized reporters.",
    "Optional: Stain nuclei population(s) of interest using antibodies for lineage-specific transcription factors. We have found success labeling hepatic macrophage nuclei using anti-PU.1. This process is described below as a template for user specific applications. Save a small portion of the sample for use as an unstained control.\nAdd 1 μg/mL anti-CD16/CD32 to prevent nonspecific binding of antibodies to FC receptors and incubate at 4°C for 20 min.\nAdd 1 μg/mL Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated anti-PU.1 and stain at 4°C for 30 min or overnight as optimized empirically.\nFill the tube with nuclei isolation buffer and centrifuge at 1,200 × g for 7 min at 4°C.\nAspirate the supernatant and refill the tube with nuclei isolation buffer, then repeat the previous centrifugation.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nNuclei sorting\nTiming: 4–6 h per liver, depending on sample purity and liver size\nIn this section, the prepared nuclei are filtered and the desired populations are purified using FACS.\nPrepare the isolated nuclei for sorting by suspending the washed nuclei in nuclei sorting buffer, then slowly pass the suspension through a 22-gauge needle and a 40-μm cell strainer. Suspending nuclei at 10–20 million/mL is a good starting point. Store on ice until sorting.\nPurify desired nuclei population using fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting.\nDuring sorter setup, pay careful attention to instrument detector thresholds and voltages/gains for light scatter.\nCritical: While sorting carefully monitor droplet profile and event rate stability.\nAfter purification, verify yield by microscopy and purity by flow cytometry.\nCentrifuge nuclei at 800 to 1,200 × g for 10 min at 4°C in PBS + 0.01% Tween 20\nCarefully aspirate all buffer then quick spin the nuclei once more at 800 to 1,200 × g.\nCarefully remove all buffer without disturbing the nuclei pellet.",
    "Snap-freeze the pellet using liquid nitrogen and store at −80°C until use for ChIP.\nPause Point: At this point, purified nuclei can be stored long-term. We have generated high-quality results using fixed nuclei stored for more than a year at −80°C."
