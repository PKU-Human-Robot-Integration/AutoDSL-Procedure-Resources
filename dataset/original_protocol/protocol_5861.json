    "Deoxycholate fractionation of FN in MCF10A and Caki-1 cellsMCF10A breast cell lines or Caki-1 renal cancer cells should be maintained to reach no more than 80-90% confluence in a T75 tissue culture flask in a 5% CO2 buffered incubator. Refer Figure 1 for the quick start protocol.Once the cells are approximately 80% confluent in the flask, aspirate the cell culture medium, rinse the cells once in 15 ml 1x PBS and aspirate before adding 2-3 ml 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA. Place the flask in a 5% CO2 buffered incubator for 5-7 min.Once the cells are successfully dislodged from the flask which you can check using a light microscope, add 3 ml of growth medium to the flask to neutralize the action of trypsin.Transfer the 6 ml cell suspension into a 15 ml conical tube and centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.After centrifugation, discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in growth medium.For plating in 6-well dishes, plate cells at a confluence that will reach 80% on the day of the experiment. For Caki-1 cells the plating number is 100,000 cells/well and MCF10A cells 70,000 cells/well. Cells in one well of the six-well plate are sufficient to visualize the detergent soluble and insoluble FN fractions for each experimental condition.Note: Cell density of 80% provides sufficient soluble and insoluble FN protein for quantification. If cell density is a variable in your experimental condition, the 80% density is ideal since cells are not too confluent to trigger cellular pathways that may interfere with your experimental read-out. Incubate the cells at 37 °C at 5% CO2.The following day, check to see whether optimum cell density has been reached. If yes, the cells can be processed for deoxycholate fractionation of FN.",
    "Note: Since the entire fractionation procedure is performed on ice, it is important at this stage that you have cold 1x PBS, cold deoxycholate lysis buffer (inhibitors freshly added) and cold SDS lysis buffer (inhibitors freshly added). Refer ‘Recipes’ section. Aspirate medium from wells and place the plates on ice in an ice bucket. Add 10 ml 1x cold PBS to remove any trace of growth medium in the cells and aspirate completely. Rinse again with 1x PBS if you see traces of media in the well. It is important at this point to make sure all PBS is aspirated so that subsequent addition of lysis buffer is not diluted.To each well, add 300 μl of cold (4 °C) deoxycholate lysis buffer containing inhibitors and immediately scrape the cells using a cell lifter.Transfer all the cells in the lysis buffer into an Eppendorf tube and lyse using a 23 G syringe needle at least 20 times.Place the tubes on a rotor wheel in the cold room and allow to rotate for 30 min. Rotor speed is not critical for lysis. Lysis time can be extended to 1 h at this point without affecting results (optional).Transfer the Eppendorf tubes to a microfuge and centrifuge at 21,130 x g for 30 min at 4 °C. If the microfuge has a maximum speed of 15,871 x g, you can increase the centrifugation time to 45 min.Check to see if you spot a pellet in the size of a pinhead. The pellets are usually very difficult to see and sometimes require a second round of centrifugation.Note: It is also a good idea to place the Eppendorf tubes in the microfuge and mark the cap of the tube where the pellet will settle. This makes it easier to know where to look for the pellet.",
    "Transfer the supernatant to a new Eppendorf tube and label it ‘soluble FN’. This protein fraction contains detergent soluble FN. To the soluble FN fraction, add 5x SDS loading dye and store in a -20 °C freezer until ready to resolve proteins on a gel.To the pellet, add 20 μl cold SDS lysis buffer containing inhibitors and mix the pellet with the buffer using a pipette tip.Heat the pellet to 95 °C for 1 min for the pellet to mix completely with the SDS lysis buffer. This protein fraction contains the deoxycholate ‘insoluble FN’.Note: Heating the pellet for 1 min with SDS lysis buffer is a necessary step to completely resuspend the pellet. Add 5x SDS loading dye, mix and store in the -20 °C freezer. Before loading ‘soluble FN and ‘insoluble FN’ samples on an SDS-PAGE gel, heat samples to 95 °C for 5 min and centrifuge at 21,130 x g at RT for 1 min.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180814/20180814222215_1085.jpgFigure 1. Flowchart for extraction and separation of the two FN fractions Biotinylation assay to measure recycled FN in MCF10A cellsThe MCF10A cells are seeded under the same conditions and incubated in a 5% CO2 buffered incubator as described in Procedure A.Reconstitute one vial of lyophilized FN-Biotin with 10 μl sterile distilled water and allow the tube to sit for a few minutes at room temperature before tapping the tube a few times to mix. The concentration of the stock will now be 2 mg/ml.Add 20 μl of the stock solution to 2 ml serum free media to make a working concentration of 20 μg/ml FN-Biotin medium. To make 2 ml serum free media containing a working concentration of 20 μg/ml FN-Biotin, you will need a total of two vials of lyophilized FN-Biotin.",
    "In our hands, reducing the working concentration to 10 μg/ml proved insufficient to determine FN uptake by MCF10A cells using immunoblotting.Before beginning the biotinylation assay, serum starve the cells for 2 h. Serum starvation is performed by aspirating growth media from the cells, washing cells two times each with 2 ml 1x PBS and adding serum-free medium to the cells.After the 2 h incubation, aspirate the serum-free medium from cells, wash cells in 6-well plates twice each with 2 ml 1x PBS, aspirate PBS completely and add 500 μl of FN-Biotin media to the cells.Incubate for 30 min in the 37 °C incubator.After incubation, aspirate the FN-Biotin medium, wash with 2 ml 1x PBS, aspirate and add 1 ml acid wash (see Recipes) for 30 sec. The acid wash step is critical to remove cell surface bound FN-Biotin. It is important not to exceed acid wash to more than 1 min as it begins to affect cell morphology.Remove the acid wash and rinse the well four times each with 2 ml 1x PBS.Aspirate the PBS and add growth medium to the cells without FN-Biotin and with or without test compounds depending on your experimental question. Since we were interested to investigate whether TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 increases FN fibrillogenesis via recycling, we had a control condition with only growth medium, growth medium containing 10 ng/ml TGFβ1 and growth medium containing 10 ng/ml TGFβ2 (Varadaraj et al., 2017).To determine whether FN is recycled to form fibrils, perform a deoxycholate fractionation as described in Procedure A, Steps 8-17, using 300 μl of deoxycholate lysis buffer per well.Resolving the FN protein on a 5% gel and immunoblottingRun the soluble and pellet lysates on a 5% SDS-PAGE gel.Load 1/10th of the total volume of soluble fraction and the entire volume of the pellet fraction.",
    "If you load 1/10th, keep the volume consistent for all experimental conditions.Let the gel run till only the top two ladders of the protein ladder are remaining within the gel -250 kDa and 150 kDa. The gel run usually takes 3-4 h at 80 V.After the run is complete, transfer the gel using either Nitrocellulose or PVDF membranes at 25 V overnight (12-16 h) in a cold room. Alternatively, the transfer tank can be placed in an ice bucket during the transfer procedure.After the transfer is complete, place the membrane in an immunoblotting box and add 5 ml of blocking buffer (sufficient volume to cover the membrane) for 1 h at room temperature and place on an orbital shaker at 55 rpm.After blocking, remove the blocking solution and wash the membrane 2-3 times with 1x TBS using gentle agitation. Make sure all traces of milk has left the membrane. Rinse until the TBS washes are clear.Add FN antibody at a dilution of 1:1,000 in primary antibody buffer and allow the membrane to incubate overnight on an orbital shaker set at a speed of 55 rpm at 4 °C.After primary antibody incubation, rinse three times by placing the membrane on an orbital shaker set at a speed of 55 rpm for 5 min in 10 ml 1x TBS 0.2% Tween.Add IR Dye 800CW secondary antibody at a dilution of 1 μl in 15 ml secondary antibody buffer for 1 h on an orbital shaker set at a speed of 55 rpm. It is important to protect the membrane from light. If the immunoblot boxes are transparent, cover the box with aluminum foil throughout the incubation and subsequent wash steps.",
    "To visualize FN-Biotin, perform Steps C1-C6 following which add Streptavidin conjugated IR Dye secondary antibody at a dilution of 1 μl in 15 ml secondary antibody buffer for 1 h on an orbital shaker set at a speed of 55 rpm. It is important to protect the membrane from light. If the immunoblot boxes are transparent, cover the box with aluminum foil throughout the incubation and subsequent wash steps.After antibody incubation, rinse three times by placing the membrane on an orbital shaker set at a speed of 55 rpm for 5 min in 10 ml 1x TBS 0.2% Tween.Remove 1x TBS 0.2% Tween and replace with 10 ml 1x TBS before imaging on the LI-COR scanner. An image scan of the membrane will appear as shown in Figure 2A.To probe for a loading control protein, run 1/10th of the soluble FN fractions on a 10% gel and immunoblot for GAPDH (Figure 2B) or Actin. Actin and GAPDH primary antibodies are used at a dilution of 1 μl in 5 ml (1 μg/5 ml) and can be reused several times if the diluted antibody is stored at 4 °C.Note: HRP conjugated secondary antibodies can also be used and processed using an ECL detection method. In that case, you will need an HRP conjugated Streptavidin secondary antibody.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180814/20180814222237_0709.jpgFigure 2. Fibronectin fractionation and analysis by immunoblotting. To visualize and quantify soluble and pellet FN, load 1/10th of the soluble and the entire pellet fractions from Caki-1 cells, on a 5% SDS-PAGE gel as shown in (A). A band above the 250 kDa MW ladder is FN. UN, 1, 2 and 3 refer to ‘untreated’ and three different treatment conditions (B). To normalize for protein loading, load 1/10th of the soluble FN on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblot for GAPDH.",
    "Pixel intensities of the protein bands are quantified using the LI-COR Lite software by drawing a rectangle (blue box) around the band. The lower value denotes the background-corrected band intensity and the upper value denotes the background."
