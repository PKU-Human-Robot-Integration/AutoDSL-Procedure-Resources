We simply place the mixture of 10–50ng plasmid (0.5 μL) and E.coli (5 μL) on ice for 30 minutes, and then spread the mixture directly on the plate pre-incubated at 37°C.\nAllow the transformed E.coli to form colonies by incubating at 37°C overnight.\nPick up a colony and inoculate it in 1.5 mL of LB medium containing 0.2% glucose and appropriate antibiotics.\nCulture at 37°C for 4 h in a shaking incubator.\nTransfer the whole amount of the 1.5 mL culture into a flask containing 100 mL of LB medium containing 0.2% glucose and appropriate antibiotics.\nCulture at 37°C in a shaking incubator until an OD600 reaches ∼0.4.\nCulture at 25°C for 2 h in a shaking incubator.\nAllow E.coli to express GST-eIF4EK119A by adding 500 μL of 100 mM IPTG (the final concentration is 0.5 mM).\nCulture at 25°C in a shaking incubator overnight.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2718-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Recombinant GST protein was used in the control pull down experiments.\nNote: The conditions above work the best in our laboratory in terms of the protein yield in the soluble fraction, although there is a significant decrease in GST-eIF4EK119A in soluble fraction (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Adding higher concentration of IPTG and/or culturing at higher temperature up to 37°C may improve the yield, however, it is advised to check the solubility of GST-eIF4EK119A before proceeding to the purification steps. Higher level of induction may cause more incorporation of GST-eIF4EK119A into the inclusion bodies.\nTransfer the E.coli culture in a centrifuge tube, and centrifuge at 5,000 g at 4°C for 10 min.\nDiscard the supernatant completely.\nPause point: The E.coli pellet can be stored at −80°C for several months.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 mL of Lysis buffer, and add 100 μL of 100XProtease inhibitor cocktail\nVortex vigorously.\nAdd 0.5 mg/mL lysozyme and mix well by inverting the tube.\nIncubate on ice for 20 min.\nSonicate the lysate (level = 2, duty = 50, 30 s, 10 times, place the tube on ice at least for 30 s at every interval).\nCentrifuge at 18,000 g at 4°C for 10 min. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube.\nPre-equilibrate 100 μL bed volume of Glutathione Sepharose 4B by washing 3 times with 500 μL of Lysis buffer.\nAdd 100 μL bed volume of Glutathione Sepharose 4B to the supernatant and rotate it at 10°C for 1.5 h.",
    "Centrifuge at 500 g at 4°C for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nResuspend the beads in 10 mL of Lysis buffer.\nCentrifuge at 500 g at 4°C for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 21–23, 4 times.\nResuspend the beads in 1 mL of Lysis buffer.\nTransfer the beads to a clean 2 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 500 g at 4°C for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nResuspend the beads in 1 mL of Lysis buffer.\nCentrifuge at 500 g at 4°C for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 29–31, 3 times.\nResuspend the beads in 500 μL of Protein Elution buffer and incubate on ice for 5 min.\nPre-rinse an Amicon Ultra-0.5 mL 30 kDa device with 500 μL of Lysis buffer. Discard flow through.\nApply the eluate to the device and centrifuge at 14,000 g at 4°C for 5 min. Discard flow through.\nResuspend the beads in 500 μL of Protein Elution buffer again and incubate on ice for 5 min.\nApply the eluate to the top unit of the same device again and centrifuge at 14,000 g at 4°C for 5 min. Discard flow through.\nRepeat steps 36–37 at least 5 times.\nNote: Typically, around 100 μL of concentrated eluates will remain in the device.\nAdd 400 μL eIF4E storage buffer to the same device.\nCentrifuge at 14,000 g at 4°C for 5 min. Discard flow through.\nRepeat the steps of 39–40.\nRecover the concentrated, buffer-exchanged eluates in a clean 1.5mL tube by reverse centrifugation at 1,000 g at 4°C for 2 min.\nAdd 80% glycerol to the final concentration of 50%.\nMeasure protein concentration by standard Bradford assay or any other alternative methods.\nMake aliquots and store at −30°C until use.",
    "Note: We confirmed that purified GST-eIF4EK119A can be used at least several months. Before using the protein samples for RNA purification, check the purity by SDS-PAGE and CBB staining. We typically make aliquots of 10–25 μg/μL GST-eIF4EK119A.\nPreparation of input RNAs\nTiming: 2.5 h\nThe procedure below ensures removal of abundant small RNAs harboring a m7G cap such as snRNA and snoRNA. If relatively smaller capped and polyadenylated RNAs (< 200 nt) such as some types of long non-coding RNAs are in your scope of the analysis, consider performing ethanol- or isopropanol- precipitation or using an appropriate RNA purification column instead of LiCl precipitation.\nPerform total RNA extraction using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instruction (Protocol can be found here[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2Ftrizol_reagent.pdf]).\nDissolve isopropanol-precipitated total RNA in an 180 μL of nuclease-free water.\nAdd 100 μL of 7.5 M LiCl and 20 μL of 500 mM EDTA.\nIncubate at −30°C for 30 min.\nCentrifuge at the max speed at 4°C for 20 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and dissolve the pellet in the same volume of nuclease-free water as in step 2.\nOptional: If desired, transfer the supernatant in a new tube and perform ethanol precipitation to monitor the removal of small RNAs is successful.\nRepeat the steps 3–6.\nWash the pellet in 300 μL of 70% ethanol.\nPause point: The RNA pellet can be stored in 70% ethanol at −80°C.\nRemove the supernatant completely and briefly dry the pellet.\nNote: Do not dry the RNA pellet completely, since the overdried pellet is hard to solubilize.\nDissolve the pellet in 150 μL of nuclease-free water.\nCheck the integrity of RNA samples by applying small portion of RNAs in agarose gel electrophoresis/SYBR Gold staining or Bioanalyzer (example results of SYBR Gold staining are shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).",
    "Pause point: Although we recommend using the RNA solution as soon as possible to avoid the risk of degradation, RNA in nuclease-free water can be safely stored at −80°C for several days.\nPurification of capped RNAs\nTiming: 3 h\nThe following protocol outlines the steps for capped RNA purification using GST-eIF4EK119A protein and small RNA-removed total RNA obtained in the above section.\nPre-equilibrate 50 μL bed volume of MagneGST Glutathione Particles by washing 3 times with 200 μL of 1X 4E-PD buffer in a 1.5 mL tube.\nResuspend the beads in 200 μL of 1X 4E-PD buffer, and add 100 μg of GST-eIF4EK119A.\nRotate the tube at 10°C for 2 h.\nPlace the tube on a magnet stand for at least 1 min.\nDiscard the supernatant, and resuspend the beads in 200 μL of 1X 4E-PD buffer.\nRotate the tube at room temperature for 1 min.\nRepeat the steps 4–6 twice.\nPlace the tube on a magnet stand for at least 1 min.\nDiscard the supernatant from the tube on the magnetic stand, and resuspend in 200 μL of 2X 4E-PD buffer supplemented with 2.5 μL of 10 mg /mL yeast tRNA and 1 μL of 40 U/μL Recombinant RNase inhibitor.\nDilute >30 μg of the LiCl-precipitated RNA in nuclease-free water to make 196.5 μL solution, and heat-denature at 65°C for 10 min, and then chill on ice more than 1 min.\nNote: Typically, about 1.2 μg of capped RNA is purified from 30 μg of total RNA extracted from HEK293T cells.\nAdd the heat-denatured RNA to the tube containing GST-eIF4EK119A-bound beads.\nRotate at 25°C for 2 h.\nPlace the tube on a magnet stand for at least 1 min.\nDiscard the supernatant, and resuspend the beads in 500 μL of 4E-PD buffer.",
    "Rotate the tube at room temperature for 1 min.\nRepeat the steps 12–14 three times.\nPlace the tube on a magnet stand for at least 1 min, and discard the supernatant completely.\nResuspend the beads in 100 μL of RNA Elution buffer, and incubate on ice for 5 min.\nPlace the tube on a magnet stand for at least 1 min, and transfer the eluates to a new 2 mL tube.\nRepeat the steps 17–19 three more times.\nNote: We routinely check the cleavage and elution of GST-eIF4EK119A by sampling a small amount of samples for SDS-PAGE/CBB-staining (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nCombine the eluate (final volume should be ∼400 μL).\nAdd 1.2 mL of TRIzol to the tube, and vortex vigorously for at least 1 min.\nAdd 240 μL of chloroform, and vortex vigorously for at least 1 min.\nIncubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nCentrifuge at 12,000 g at 4°C for 10 min.\nTransfer the aqueous phase (∼1 mL) to a new 15 mL tube.\nAdd 1 μL of glycogen, mix well.\nAdd 2.5 mL of ethanol and 100 μL of 3 M sodium acetate.\nMix well, and incubate at -30°C for at least 1 h. Overnight incubation is recommended.\nPause point: The solution can be stored at -30°C or -80°C for several weeks.\nCentrifuge at the maximum speed at 4°C for 15 min\nRemove the supernatant completely, and briefly dry the pellet.\nNote: Do not dry the RNA pellet completely, since the overdried pellet is hard to solubilize.\nDissolve the RNA pellet in 10 μL of nuclease-free water.\nUse 1 μL of RNA to measure the concentration using Fluorometer such as QuantiFluor RNA system.",
    "Note: We recommend using more than 1 μg of capped RNA to proceed the following steps. Using the lower amount of RNA might cause significant reduction in the final amount of library RNAs and the throughput.\nOptional: Quality of cap-purified RNA can be checked by agarose gel electrophoresis/SYBR Gold staining or Bioanalyzer (example results are shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nLibrary preparation and nanopore direct RNA sequencing\nTiming: 3 h (library preparation), up to 72 h (sequencing run)\nFinally, the recovered capped RNA is then used for library preparation for nanopore dRNA-seq.\nAdd 1.8 volume of RNAClean XP to >1 μg of capped RNA.\nPurify capped RNA according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Protocol can be found here)\nElute RNA in 11 μL of nuclease-free water.\nUse 1 μL of RNA to measure the concentration using Fluorometer such as QuantiFluor RNA system.\nPreparate library using 9 μL of RNA eluates according to “Direct RNA sequencing” protocol from Oxford Nanopore for use with the kit (Protocol can be found here[href=https://community.nanoporetech.com/docs/prepare/library_prep_protocols/direct-rna-control-sqk-rna002/v/drce_9079_v2_revt_14aug2019?devices=minion], note: registration and sign in required).\nCritical: Although it is optional, we strongly recommend performing reverse transcription after the adapter ligation. When using reverse transcriptase other than SuperScriptIII (Thermo Scientific), it is advised to compare the throughput and the quality of the sequencing data with the library prepared using SuperScript III. This can be achieved at low cost by applying a small fraction of libraries to Flongle flow cells. In our experience, SuperScript III gives better results in nanopore direct RNA-sequencing than SuperScript IV (data not shown). The other RT enzymes such as Maxima H Minus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, EP0751) and Induro Reverse Transcriptase (New England BioLabs, M0681S) may give even better results. Induro is a recently released RT enzyme with high processivity (for more information, visit here[href=https://nanoporetech.com/sites/default/files/s3/posters/lc2020/LC2020-Poster-LuoSun.pdf]).",
    "Optional: It is a good practice to always add spike-in controls such as RNA CS (RCS, provided in the Oxford nanopore’s kit) in the beginning of the library preparation.\nLoad the RNA library to the MinION flowcell and run using MinKNOW.\nNote: We routinely measure library concentration using Fluorometer such as QuantiFluor RNA system before applying to a flowcell. When starting amount of capped RNA is 1 μg, we typically obtain 500–750 ng RNA library.\nAn example pipeline for base calling, alignment and downstream analysis\nTiming: days to months\nWhen the required number of reads are obtained, or when almost all the pores are inactivated, you may stop sequencing and proceed to computational analysis. The following is an example for the downstream analysis.",
    "MinKNOW software generates HDF5 format files with an extension “.fast5”, which contains the electrical signal data per RNA molecule sequenced. The signal can be converted into nucleic acid sequence using basecaller such as Oxford Nanopore’s Guppy, which produces FASTQ files and a text summary file. Basecalling can be performed during or after sequence run. We routinely perform quality control analysis of sequence using software such as MinIONQC,14[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14] NanoPlot15[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15] and pycoQC.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] Long read alignment to a reference genome can be performed using minimap2,16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] which generates SAM files when running with an “-a” option. Minimap2 is one of the least resource-demanding software in terms of CPU hours and peak memory usage.21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18] BAM and BAM index files can be obtained using samtools.19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19] The results of read alignment can be visualized by loading the BAM files to IGV. When using Oxford Nanopore’s RCS (yeast Enolase II, YHR174W) as a spike-in control, align them to the yeast genome. Read assignment to genes and read counting per gene can be achieved using featureCounts17[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] with a “-L” option or LIQA.22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21] LIQA is designed for isoform-specific quantification, and thus suitable for alternative splicing aware analysis. There are several poly(A) tail length estimation tools such as nanopolish polya6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] and tailfindr.18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23],23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]"
