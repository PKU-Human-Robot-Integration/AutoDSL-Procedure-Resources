    "Preparation of wheat materials Grow plants in a chamber/greenhouse with the corresponding conditions.Note: Here, wheat plants were grown in a growth chamber maintained at 16 °C ± 2 °C with a 16 h light and 8 h dark photoperiod and 70% relative humidity. Collect approximately 100 mg of leaf samples from two-weeks-old wheat plants in a 2 mL safe-lock microcentrifuge tube for genomic DNA extraction.Isolate total genomic DNA from wheat plant leaves using the CTAB method (Chen et al., 2014).Digest each sample of genomic DNA using the restriction enzyme EcoRI followed by RNase A treatment. An example restriction digestion reaction is shown in Table 1.Table 1. Example reaction for restriction endonuclease digestion of genomic DNA table:\n﻿Components,Volume\n10× restriction enzyme buffer,5 μL\nEcoRI (10–20 U/μL),2 μL\nGenomic DNA,1 μg\nNuclease-free water,Up to 50 μL\nTotal,50 μL\nIncubate the restriction reaction mixture at 37 °C for 1 h and then add 1 μL of RNase A. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, inactivate the mixture by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. Following inactivation, the digested genomic DNA can be used directly in the next step without further cleanup.Primers selection The wheat puroindoline-b (PINb) gene with a single copy was used as a reference gene to estimate transgene copy number (Collier et al., 2017). The primers of target genes were designed using a primer design software (e.g., Primer 5), which amplifies a 100–120 base pair region of both transgene targets. An example of target genes primers and wheat PINb gene primers are shown in Table 2.Table 2. Primers used in ddPCR table:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nName,Sequence,Length,Targets\nTaPINb-F,AGTTGGCGGCTGGTACAATG,20,Wheat PINb gene\nTaPINb-R,ACATCGCTCCATCACGTAATCC,23,Wheat PINb gene\nTaPINb-prove,FAM-TCAACAATGTCCGCAGGAGCG-VIC,23,Wheat PINb gene\npUbi-F,GTAGATAATGCCAGCCTGTTAAAC,24,Ubi promoter\npUbi-R,GACGCGACGCTGCTGGTT,18,Ubi promoter\npUbi-prove,FAM-CGTCGACGAGTCTAACGGACACCAAC-VIC,29,Ubi promoter",
    "Each primer pair needs to be checked first in a test PCR reaction. Use the reaction with genomic DNA from non-transgenic wheat plants or H2O as negative control. Assemble the reaction as shown in Table 3.Table 3. PCR reaction for testing ddPCR primer pairs table:\n﻿Components,Stock concentration,Final concentration,Volume\n2×QX200TM ddPCRTM EvaGreen® supermix,2×,1×,5 μL\nForward primer,2 μM,250 nM,1.25 μL\nReverse primer,2 μM,250 nM,1.25 μL\nGenomic DNA,,,50 ng\nNuclease-free water,,,Up to 10 μL\nTotal,,,10 μL\nLabel the reference gene probes with 5' FAMTM (6-Carboxyfluorescein) and the transgene probes with 5' VICTM (6-VIC).The cycling conditions of the PCR reaction are shown in Table 4.Table 4. PCR cycling conditions for testing ddPCR primer pairs table:\n﻿Step,Temperature (°C),Time,Number of cycles\nEnzyme activation,95,5 min,1.0\nDenaturation,95,30 s,40.0\nAnnealing,60,30 s,\nExtension,72,30 s,\nSignal stabilization,72,5 min,1.0\nHold,10,∞,1.0\nSeparate the PCR product by agarose gel electrophoresis. Obtain the single clear bands with the expected sizes for reference and target primers (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4567/bioprotoc-12-23-4567-g001.jpgFigure 1. Example of PCR product showing the expected sizes obtained for reference and target primers ddPCR setup Assemble the PCR reactions as shown in Table 5. The genomic DNA from non-transgenic wheat plants or H2O were used as template as negative controls and added into the reaction. The primers of reference gene and transgenic genes were mixed in one reaction for each sample. It is critical that the assayed ddPCR reactions are well mixed prior to proceeding to droplet generation. The concentration of each component must be the same in every droplet.Table 5. Example ddPCR reaction table:\n﻿Components,Stock concentration,Final concentration,Volume\n2× QX200TM ddPCRTM EvaGreen® supermix,2×,1×,10 μL\nForward primer of reference gene,2 μM,250 nM,2.5 μL\nReverse primer of reference gene,2 μM,250 nM,2.5 μL\nForward primer of reference gene,2 μM,250 nM,2.5 μL\nReverse primer of reference gene,2 μM,250 nM,2.5 μL\nGenomic DNA,,,50 ng\nNuclease-free water,,,Up to 20 μL\nTotal,,,20 μL",
    "Droplet generation Load the cartridge into the QX200 droplet generator.Load 20 μL of the ddPCR reaction into individual sample wells of the DG8TM droplet generator cartridge.Add 70 μL of QX200 droplet generation oil for EvaGreen® into the oil wells.Cover the cartridge with the DG8TM gasket (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4567/bioprotoc-12-23-4567-g002.jpgFigure 2. Workflow of droplet generation The QX200 droplet generator uses microfluidics to combine oil and aqueous samples to generate the nanoliter-sized droplets required for ddPCR analysis. It processes up to eight samples at a time in approximately 2 min.Transfer the entire volume of the droplet emulsion (typically 70 μL) to the desired wells of a semi-skirted 96-well ddPCR plate.Cover the 96-well ddPCR plate with a pierceable foil plate heat seal using a heat sealer according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Note: Take care to pipette very slowly to avoid disrupting the emulsified droplets.Place the 96-well ddPCR plate containing the PCR products into a thermal cycler and use cycling conditions as shown in Table 6. The annealing temperature was decided by the Tm value of the primers (normally < 5 °C than Tm value).Table 6. PCR cycling conditions for ddPCR.  Use a 2 °C/s ramping rate for all steps.table:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nStep,Temperature (°C),Time,Number of cycles\nEnzyme activation,95,10 min,1\nDenaturation,94,30 s,40\nAnnealing,58,1 min,40\nSignal stabilization,98,10 min,1\nHold,10,∞,1",
    "Droplet counting Switch on the QX200TM droplet reader and open the QuantaSoftTM software after the PCR cycle is finished.Turn on the new experiment in the QuantaSoftTM software.Select the wells that need detection, enter the sample names, and record the well positions for target and reference genes for each sample.Select the key parameters in the wells that need detection as follows:Experiment: ABS (absolute quantitation).Supermix: QX200TM ddPCR EvaGreen supermix.Target 1 type: Ch1 unknown.Target 2 type: Ch2 unknown.Enter the sample name to distinguish transgenes and reference genes.Apply the chosen parameters to the selected wells by clicking OK.Place the 96-well PCR plate into the plate holder as follows (Figure 3):Place the 96-well PCR plate containing the amplified droplets into the base of the plate holder. Well A1 of the PCR plate must be in the top-left position.Move the release tabs of the top of the plate holder to the “up” position and place the top on the PCR plate. Firmly press down both release tabs to secure the PCR plate in the holder.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4567/bioprotoc-12-23-4567-g003.jpgFigure 3. Placing the 96-well plate into the plate holder After closing the lid, check if the indicator lights for “power,” “bottle level,” and “plate in place” are green.Click Run in the left navigation bar to start the run.In the Run Options window, select the detection chemistry.Note: If a probe supermix is selected in the well editor, the probe dye setting appears; select FAM/HEX or FAM/VIC. If an EvaGreen supermix is selected, the EvaGreen dye setting appears, and the screen confirms the number of EvaGreen wells configured on the plate."
