    "Notes: Select wild-type P. syringae pv. phaseolicola 1448A (Psph) as the model strain (Xiao et al., 2007) and rhpS deletion mutant (ΔrhpS) (Xie et al., 2019) as the test strain. Perform the step-by-step protocol described in Figure 1. Perform the entire procedure gently to avoid damaging the biofilm. Collect the liquid crystal violet and ethanol waste liquor in specially labeled containers for professional disposal by trained staff, as per the safety regulations at City University of Hong Kong.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190514/20190514193538_1604.jpgFigure 1. Schematic step-by-step protocol for visualizing P. syringae biofilm formation. A. The Psph strain was activated on King’s B (KB) plate and cultured in liquid medium. B. Then the cultures were inoculated at 1:500 dilutions into KB liquid medium and incubated statically to sampling points. C. Then stained the biofilm by using 0.1% crystal violet. D. Measure the biofilm production at OD590nm. Two biological replicates were showed.Bacterial growthCollect a Psph colony from the glycerol stock culture frozen at -80 °C and inoculate on a King’s B (KB) plate supplemented with rifampicin (25 μg/ml). Incubate the KB plate at 28 °C for 36 h in a constant temperature incubator.Collect a single colony from the cultured plates and inoculate into a sterile 10 ml tube containing 2 ml KB liquid medium supplemented with rifampicin (25 μg/ml). Incubate the tube in a benchtop shaking incubator at 28 °C for 12 h with constant shaking at 220 rpm.Biofilm formationInoculate the Psph culture (1:500 dilutions) into 16 sterile 10 ml borosilicate glass tubes containing 2 ml KB liquid medium (supplemented with rifampicin) and ensure consistent initial dose. Incubate the Psph-containing glass tubes at 28 °C in a constant temperature incubator without shaking.Biofilm visualizationHarvest the biofilm samples at different time points. For Psph in our study, the biofilms were harvested at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h.",
    "Gently discard the planktonic cells with a 1 ml pipette and wash the tubes three times with sterile distilled water. Avoid damaging the biofilm formed on the tube wall.Stain the biofilm forming bacteria with 2.5 ml 0.1% crystal violet for 20 min without shaking. Discard the dye and wash the tubes with sterile distilled water to remove the unbound dye. Dry the tubes and take photographs (Figure 2A).Biofilm measurementElute the biofilm with 2 ml 100% ethanol and shake the tubes at 220 rpm for 20 min to ensure that the dye has dissolved completely. Take photographs (Figure 2B).Measure the eluted samples at OD590nm using a spectrophotometer (2 ml) or Synergy 2 Plate Reader (BioTek) (100 μl). If the sample concentrations are too high, diluted them before measuring. Use an equal volume of 95%-100% ethanol as the blank control. Psph biofilm formation is shown in Figure 2C. The ΔrhpS produces lower biofilm compared with Psph wild-type strain (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190514/20190514193650_8557.jpgFigure 2. Visualization and quantification of biofilm in Psphwild-type strain. A. Biofilm samples were grown from 24 to 96 h. Biofilm adhered to borosilicate glass tubes at different time points were stained with crystal violet. B. The crystal violet bound to the biofilm on the wall of the tubes was eluted by ethanol. C. The elution samples were measured at OD590nm by using spectrophotometer or Synergy 2 Plate Reader (BioTek). Psph wild-type strain produced more biofilm at 96 h than 24 h. * represents P-value < 0.05. *** represents P-value < 0.001. Error bars indicate S.D. among four biological replicates. Two biological replicates were shown. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190514/20190514193714_4941.jpgFigure 3. The ΔrhpS strain produced less biofilm than did that in Psph wild-type strain. A.",
    "Biofilm produced by the Psph wild-type and the ΔrhpS strain were visualized using borosilicate glass tubes and stained with crystal violet at 96 h. B. The crystal violet bound to the biofilm on tube wall was eluted by ethanol. C. The Psph wild-type strain produced more biofilm than the ΔrhpS strain (P-value = 0.000136). *** represents P-value < 0.001. Error bars indicate S.D. among four biological replicates. Two biological replicates were shown."
