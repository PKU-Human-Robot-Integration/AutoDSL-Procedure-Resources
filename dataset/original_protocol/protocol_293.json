  "procedures": [
    "1) Habituate the monkey to the primate chair\n2) Train the monkey to the various motor tasks to assess manual dexterity daily. Duration of a behavioral session is 30-60 minutes\n3) Establish during 2 months the pre-lesion behavioral scores\n4) Perform the cervical hemi-section at C7\n5) Place osmotic pump to deliver the antibody during 4 weeks\n6) Immediately after the lesion, test daily the motor performance to establish the post-lesion behavioral scores \\(2-3 months)\n7) Injection of BDA at multiple sites in the contralesional motor cortex\n8) Survival time \\(60-70 days)\n9) Sacrifice of the animal\n10) Histology: sections \\(50 microns thick) of the brain and spinal cord.
