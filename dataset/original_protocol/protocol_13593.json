    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Mayo Clinic.\n1. Setup\nFast 8- to 10-week-old mice for 4 h. Provide mice with access to water.\n\tNOTE: We use wild-type male C57BL/6J mice for all experiments presented here, but they can be performed on mice of any strain, gender and genotype.\nCool 15 mL of distilled water in a 50 mL conical tube in a 4 °C refrigerator.\nHeat another 15 mL of distilled water in a beaker using a hot plate with a magnetic stir bar to approximately 80-90 °C.\nMeasure 0.5% methylcellulose for a total of 30 mL (0.15 g).\nGently add methylcellulose to 15 mL of hot water so that it does not clump. The methylcellulose solution will be cloudy during this process.\nOnce dissolved, remove the beaker from the hot plate and add the 15 mL of chilled water to the hot beaker.\nPlace in a 4 °C fridge until the solution is clear, approximately 15-20 min.\nWhen clear, weigh 3 mg of rhodamine isothiocyanate (RITC)-dextran per 5 mL of 0.5% methylcellulose solution and mix to combine. This is the liquid condition in the Representative Results section.\n\t\nAlternatively, weigh 25 mg of fluorescent polyethylene microspheres and mix with 200 µL of the methylcellulose solution until well incorporated. Thorough incorporation of microspheres is ensured by vortex prior to gavage. The experimenter must visualize homogeneous distribution of suspended microspheres in the mixture.\nAs the RITC-dextran solution is light sensitive, refrigerate the solution. Prepare the RITC-dextran solution and the microshpere mixture in advance and use within 2 months. Resuspend the microsphere mixture before use.",
    "​NOTE: Microspheres of varying sizes are used to study gastrointestinal handling of different materials. In the Representative Results section, we demonstrate the results of using small (diameter: 75-90 µm) and larger (diameter: 180-212 µm) microspheres.\n2. Intraluminal content gavage\nPrepare the gavage by attaching an 18 Ga x 50 mm feeding tube to a 1 mL syringe and drawing 200 µL of RITC solution or microsphere solution.\nManually restrain the fasted animal using the one-handed restraint technique25. Refer to the institution's information on proper murine restraint techniques.\nGently insert the feeding tube through the mouth and esophagus of the mouse until it enters the stomach.\n\t​NOTE: The gavage step is critical for a successful experiment. It requires experienced hands that can consistently insert the tube roughly the same distance in each mouse. This step needs to be standardized by experimenters carrying out the protocol. The same experimenter should gavage all mice cohorts that will be compared to each other.\nSlowly expel the syringe contents into the stomach and carefully remove the tube from the mouse.\nFollowing the gavage, return the mouse to the cage.\nDispose of the gavage tube.\nRepeat the process as needed for the desired number of animals.\n3. Bowel dissection\nBefore beginning the dissections, turn on the in vivo imaging instrument to allow it to come to temperature.\nSacrifice the mouse 30 min after the gavage. Use carbon dioxide inhalation to sacrifice the mouse, followed by cervical dislocation to ensure successful euthanasia.\nAfter confirming successful euthanasia, place the mouse in supine position on a dissection stage and pin its four appendages on the stage to have access to the abdomen. Wet the surface of the abdomen with 70% ethanol to wet the abdominal hairs.",
    "Use micro-dissection forceps (#5) to pull the skin and acquire sharp surgical scissors to make a transverse incision 1 cm above the anus. To expose the intraperitoneal cavity, continue the incision vertically up the abdomen until the rib cage.\nGently move the cecum to the left with the micro-dissection forceps to expose the distal colon.\nCut the distal colon with micro-dissection scissors just proximal to the rectum.\nGently unravel the colon, cecum, and small intestine by pulling slowly in the opposite direction.\n\tNOTE: Maintaining the dissected bowels in one continuous segment will create the most ease for the investigator. Rips and tears along the segment will cause subsequent steps to be more difficult.\nUse micro-dissection scissors to cut proximal to the stomach.\nUse forceps to transfer the dissected bowels to the measurement sheet (Figure 1). Place the stomach at 0 mm and arrange the bowels along the ruler until 200 mm. Use micro-dissection scissors to cut at 200 mm. Repeat this process of aligning the bowels from 0 mm to 200 mm along the rulers while remaining confident that the orientation of the bowels does not get confused.\n\t\nBe careful to avoid stretching the bowels while aligning to the rulers.\nOnce the tissue is arranged on the ruler, arrange the cecum so that it is parallel with the tissue but not in direct contact with it (if any fluorescence is found within that region, then a clear difference distinction between the cecum and the intestines will be needed).\nPlace the measurement sheet with the dissected tissue in a dark area so the fluorescence can be preserved until it is time to image.\n4. Ex vivo imaging\nOpen the in vivo imaging software and log in.\nInitialize the imaging instrument so it is ready for image acquisition.",
    "Set the 'Excitation' and 'Emission' fields to the corresponding color used for the bead or RITC gavage. Red (liquid): excitation 535 nm /emission 600 nm. Green (microspheres): excitation 465 nm /emission 520 nm.\nSet the exposure to 'Auto'.\nSelect the field of view.\nBefore placing the measurement sheet into the instrument, ensure the intestines have not shifted during transport.\nPlace the measurement sheet into the instrument within the field of view.\nSecurely shut the door to the instrument and select Snapshot to photograph the field of view.\nSave collected pictures to a flash drive for analysis. Save individual captures of the fluorescent and photograph images. An overlay of the photograph and fluorescence indicates the location of fluorescent material in the GI tract (Figure 1).\n\t​NOTE: We recommend saving the files in the Tag Image File (.tif) format for downstream processing.\n5. Analysis\nOpen the fluorescent and photograph image files in a picture editing software.\nAdjust the pixel size of both images such that they have the exact same dimensions (our convention was to set both images to 1280 pixels by 850 pixels [height x width]).\nClose the photograph file. The following steps involve only the fluorescent image.\nUse an eraser tool to remove the background and make it transparent. An eraser may be needed to remove patches of the remaining background.\nCreate a new layer. Make it an entirely black background to the fluorescent signal. This can be achieved by choosing a black fill to the layer and dragging the layer to lie below the layer with the fluorescent image.\nSave the new fluorescent image, containing only the fluorescent signal on a black background, as a new .tif file.\nOpen the new fluorescent and photograph images in ImageJ.",
    "Turn each image into a 32-bit image by choosing Image > Type > 32-bit.\nCreate a merged image of both by choosing Image > Color > Merge Channels. In the dialog box that opens, select the photograph file for the gray channel and the fluorescent file under any colored channels.\nTurn off the scale of the merged image by selecting Analyze > Set Scale > Click to Remove Scale.\nSelect the \"Rectangle\" tool in ImageJ.\nDraw a rectangle around a section of the small bowel. Pay close attention to the width of this region of interest (ROI), as it should remain constant between all ROIs. The nominal value is not essential, just that it is kept consistent across all ROIs drawn on this image [since the small bowel takes over several rows, individual ROIs will be drawn over each section of the small bowel in a different row (Figure 1)]. Figure 2 shows the location of the width value in the ImageJ toolbar.\nDuplicate the ROI by selecting Image > Duplicate. Select only the channel corresponding to the colored channel.\nUse the rectangle tool again to draw an ROI over the whole new image.\nRetrieve a profile of the fluorescence by selecting Analyze > Plot Profile. The resulting graph plots on the y-axis the average intensity for each pixel along the length of the ROI. This was selected in step 5.12 to be the length of the analyzed section of the small bowel\nOpen the list of values and copy them to a spreadsheet software.",
    "Repeat steps 5.12-5.16 for each section of the small bowel on a different ruler row. Keep pasting the values on the same spreadsheet file immediately under each previous set of values, such that all continuous rows in that column contain the average intensity value for the entire length of the small bowel.\nIn the spreadsheet software, multiply each average intensity value by the constant width of the ROI rectangle created in step 5.12. This will yield the real intensity value along the small bowel at each point.\n\tNOTE: Different animals will have slight variations on small bowel length. To prevent the length differences from affecting the outcome of downstream data analysis, the string of intensity values needs to be binned into a consistent number of bins across all experimental samples (Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5 display results for three bin sizes).\nDivide the number of intensity values by the number of bins desired. The resulting quotient S determines the number of intensity values being included in each bin.\nDetermine the bin where each raw intensity value will go by using a roundup formula. This step places each raw intensity value into a bin. Each raw intensity value is chronologically indexed with the integer N. The quotient N/S determines the bin number assigned to each raw value. The roundup formula should round this quotient to a whole number with no decimals.\nGenerate the value for each bin by using an averageif formula. The objective is to average the raw values assigned to a specific bin in Step 5.20. Hence, the arguments in the formula should be: (1) assigned bins generated in Step 5.20, (2) bin number, (3) raw intensity values.",
    "NOTE: The first analysis we can perform on the binned data is a geometric center analysis, which quantifies how far we observe the highest fluorescent intensity along the small intestine (Figure 4).\nNormalize each intensity value over the total fluorescent intensity. In other words, divide each intensity value by the sum of all intensities.\nMultiply each normalized value by the bin number. The product reflects the relative weight of each bin, contributing to the total fluorescent intensity.\nAdding all values generated in Step 5.23 yields the bin number at the center of the fluorescent signal. Divide by the number of bins to express the geometric center as the fraction of small bowel traveled by the fluorescent center.\n\tNOTE: To reflect the spatial distribution of the signal, the next step is to generate the power spectrum of the binned intensity data set (Figure 5).\nOpen a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) wizard in the spreadsheet software. Select the input as the binned data set and the output as an empty set of the same number of rows as bins.\nExtract the real value component of the FFT.\nRaise each real value of the FFT to the second power. This yields a data set of power spectra.\nSelect the first half of the power spectra data set and move it so that it lies below the second half. This has the effect of centering the power spectra around the center frequency when it is plotted in the next step.\nPlot the power spectra on the y-axis of an x-y graph where the x-axis values are the range from -1 x (number of bins/2) to (number of bins/2) -1. In the case of 1000 bins, the axis values would range from -500 to 499.",
    "Power spectra for each animal should be compared on the basis of the spread of non-zero peaks and the heights of these non-zero peaks.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
