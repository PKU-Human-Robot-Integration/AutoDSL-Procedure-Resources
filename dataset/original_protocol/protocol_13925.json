    "1. Human corneal epithelial cell culture\nGrow immortalized HCEC19 in collagen-coated 75 cm2 flasks with 20 mL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium/nutrient mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: Shaking is not required.\nChange the media every 2−3 days.\n2. Preparation of cells for testing\nAfter the cells are almost confluent remove culture media.\nAdd 4−6 mL of cell disassociation solution to each 75 cm2 flasks. Incubate the cells at 37 °C until the cells detach (approximately 20−30 min), checking under the microscope periodically.\nAdd 2−6 mL of DMEM/F12 containing 10% FBS to each 75 cm2 flask.\nTransfer the contents of the flask to a 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the cells at 450−500 x g for 5 min. Pipet out the supernatant and resuspend the cells in pre-warmed media.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer. Calculate the volume of media that contains a total of 1 x 105 cells.\nAdd 1 x 105 cells to each well of a 48 well collagen-1 coated culture plate. Add enough media to the well so that the final volume of media in the well is 0.5 mL of culture DMEM/F12 with 10% FBS.\n\tNOTE: An artificial tear formulation may cause cytotoxicity that can be measured by a decrease in the metabolic activity of HCEC. The consistency of the data is dependent on adding the same number of HCEC to each well when seeding. The culture concentration that is recommended for 48 well plates is 1 x 105. Because mammalian cells can settle in the centrifuge tube after resuspending, it is recommended to resuspend the cells by agitation frequently while seeding the plates with cells so that the cell suspension has the HCEC equally distributed.",
    "Incubate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.\n3. No desiccation protocol\nControl procedure\n\t\nAfter the 24 h incubation remove the culture media from the plate.\nImmediately treat with 150 µL of a test formulation and media control solution.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min.\nRemove the test solutions from the cells.\nAdd 0.5 mL of 10% metabolic dye solution to test for metabolic activity. Incubate the cells for another 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nAfter the 4 h incubation period, remove 100 µL of metabolic dye solution from each well and place each 100 µL into a well of a 96 well plate.\nMeasure the fluorescence of each well using a fluorescent plate reader (Table of Materials). Set the excitation wavelength at 540 nm and the emission wavelength at 590 nm.\nNo desiccation protocol (recovery procedure)\n\t\nRepeat steps 3.1.1−3.1.4.\nAdd 0.5 mL of DMEM/F12 media to each well.\nIncubate one set of cultures for 18 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRemove the media and add 0.5 mL of 10% metabolic dye solution. Repeat steps 3.1.6 and 3.1.7.\n4. Desiccation protocol\nControl procedure\n\t\nAfter the 24 h incubation (step 2.8), remove the culture media from the plate.\nImmediately treat with 150 µL of a test formulation and media control solution.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 30 min.\nRemove the test solutions from the cells.\nPlace the cells in a 37 °C and 45% RH chamber for 5 min to desiccate the cells.\nAdd 0.5 mL of 10% metabolic dye solution to test metabolic activity. Incubate the cells for another 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.",
    "After the 4 h incubation period, remove 100 µL of metabolic dye solution from each well and place each 100 µL into a well of a 96 well plate.\nMeasure the fluorescence of each well using a fluorescent plate reader. Set the excitation wavelength at 540 nm and the emission wavelength at 590 nm.\nRecovery procedure\n\t\nRepeat steps 4.1.1-4.1.5.\nAdd 0.5 mL of DMEM/F12 media to each well.\nIncubate one set of cultures for 18 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRemove the media and add 0.5 mL of 10% metabolic dye solution. Repeat steps 4.1.7 and 4.1.8.\n5. Data analysis\nCalculate the average fluorescence of the media control. Calculate the percent viability of the sample using the follow formula:\n\tPercent viability of the sample = test sample fluorescence/media control fluorescence x 100\n\tNOTE: The media control average is 100% viability. The metabolic dye by itself has a small amount of fluorescence associated with it. The fluorescence of the metabolic dye reagent can be subtracted from the control and test sample fluorescence prior to calculating % viability of the test samples to the media control.\nPerform a normality test and a test for equal variances on the control and test samples.\nIf the normality test passes and the variances are equal then perform a one-way ANOVA. To identify significant differences between specific groups perform a pairwise comparisons post hoc test (i.e., Tukey or Dunnett's multiple comparisons tests).\nIf the normality test passes and the variances are different then perform the Welch's ANOVA. To identify significant differences between specific groups perform a pairwise comparisons post hoc test (i.e., Dunnett's or Games-Howell multiple comparisons tests).",
    "If the normality test fails use a nonparametric test (i.e., Kruskal-Wallis test). To identify significant differences between specific groups perform a pairwise comparisons post hoc test (i.e., Dunn's test)."
