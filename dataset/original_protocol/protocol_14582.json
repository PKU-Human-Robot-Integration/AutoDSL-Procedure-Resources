    "All in vivo experiments were performed under a protocol approved by the University Health Network Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Animal Model\nCulture between 5 to 7 x 106 MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma tumor cells in DMEM together with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and 100x dilution of penicillin-streptomycin.\nHarvest cells when they are 80% confluent using a 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution. After 3-5 min neutralize trypsin-EDTA with a 3x volume of DMEM. Take a 15 µl aliquot of cells and count using a hemocytometer. Centrifuge cells into a pellet for 5 min at 200 x g, and re-suspend in HBS at a concentration of 10 x 106 cells per ml.\nImplant subcutaneous (SC) tumors by injecting 1 to 2 x 106 cells in the hind limb of each 8 to 12 week old female SCID mouse (n = 5). Use a standard 25 G needle for injection.\nMonitor tumor growth using calipers (Volume = 0.5 x Length x Width2) and start the measurements once the SC tumors have reached a volume >200 mm3 (approximately 7 to 9 days).\n2. CT-liposome Preparation and Characterization\nLiposome Preparation\n\t\nDissolve lipid components (200 mmol/L) for the CT-liposomes, including 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), cholesterol (CH), and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-poly(ethylene glycol) 2000 (DSPE-PEG2000) in anhydrous ethanol at 70 °C at a molar ratio of 55:40:5 DPPC:CH:DSPE-PEG2000.\nEvaporate ethanol by maintaining heat at 70 °C, then add the CT contrast agent iohexol (300 mg/ml of iodine) to the solution such that the final lipid concentration is 100 mM.\nMaintain the solution at 70 °C for 4 hr with frequent vortexing.",
    "To obtain unilamellar vesicles, extrude the sample 5 times through two stacked 200 nm pore size membranes at a pressure of 250 psi and extrude again by 5 cycles through two stacked 80 nm pore size membranes at 400 psi using a 10 ml lipid extruder. Pipette a volume of 10 ml of liposomes into the extruder at the beginning of each extrusion cycle and collect into a sterile conical tube or glass vial after each extrusion cycle.\nRemove the un-encapsulated iohexol by 16 hr of dialysis using a 100 kDa molecular weight cut off (MWC) dialysis bag against a 250-fold volume excess of 0.02 mM HEPES-buffered saline solution (HBS, pH 7.4). For example, place 1 ml of liposome solution inside the dialysis bag with 250 ml of HBS outside the bag in a beaker.\nConcentrate the CT-liposomes using a 750,000 nomical MWC commercial tangential flow system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Concentrate to a final iodine concentration of approximately 55 mg ml-1.\nLiposome Characterization\n\t\nMeasure encapsulation efficiency by rupturing the CT-liposomes using a 10-fold volume excess of ethanol to release the ioxehol and then dilute using a 100-fold volume excess of deionized water (i.e. 10 μl of liposomes ruptured using 100 μl of ethanol and then diluted to a final volume of 10 ml).\nDetermine iohexol concentration using a UV spectrometer with detection at a wavelength of 245 nm. Calculate the encapsulations efficiency by taking the ratio amount of released iohexol agent to the amount of agent added during preparation.\nMeasure the hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential using a dynamic light scattering particle size analyzer system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dilute the CT-liposome solution by 200x (i.e. 5 μl of liposome in 1 ml of final volume) in deionized water to facilitate measurements.",
    "3. CT Imaging of Tumor Microcirculation and CT-liposome Distribution\nNOTE: Follow the manufacturer's instructions for performing a volumetric scan if different software version or equipment is used.\nAnesthetize each mouse using 2% isoflurane mixed with medical air or oxygen and confirm by pinching the toe and observing no reaction. Apply ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia. Immobilize animal in a prone position by taping paws to a thin plastic board.\nPlace a custom 27 G catheter, connected to 20 cm on PE10 tubing, into the lateral tail vein and secure in place with several pieces of tape.\nPrepare a 1 ml syringe to contain at least 200 µl of the CT-liposomes. Prepare a 1 ml syringe with saline to use to flush the catheter. Finally, prepare a 1 ml syringe with at least 150 µl of free iohexol mixed with saline (9:1 ratio by volume).\nPlace the mouse prone on the micro-CT scanner bed. Use the laser positioning system to place the tumor in approximately the same orientation for each scan.\nPlace the CT-liposome syringe in a syringe pump and attach the catheter to the syringe. Set the pump rate of 10 µl per sec.\nInitialize the system by performing a bright-dark calibration scan using the CT-scanner console software. Select the bright-dark scan option for each imaging protocol of interest, select bright-dark from the drop down menu and press the scan button to initiate the calibration.",
    "Perform a volumetric anatomical micro-CT of the tumor prior to any contrast agent injection. Look at the CT scanner console software indicator to ensure the CT-scanner safety interlocks have been cleared. On the CT scanner console select scan select an x-ray energy of 80 kV, a tube current of 70 mA, and captures 1,000 image projections over time 16 sec. Press the scan button to initiate the scan.\nUse the syringe pump to inject a bolus of CT-liposomes at a concentration of 400 mg iodine kg-1. Set the pump to inject a volume of approximately 150 µl (assuming a 25 g mouse). Press the 'start' button on the pump to inject. Manually flush the catheter with 50 µl of saline (twice the volume of the catheter) to ensure the entire agent amount was injected and the catheter is clear.\nWait 10 min after the injection of CT-liposomes and then perform a second anatomical scan using the same method and settings described in 3.5.\nPerform a DCE-CT scan by setting the syringe pump to inject a volume of 100 µl of the free iohexol mixed with saline (9:1 ratio by volume) using the same injection rate setting described in 3.3.\n\t\nOn the CT-scanner console select the 5 min dynamic scan that uses an x-ray energy setting of 80 kV, a tube energy of 90mA, and captures 416 image projections every sec for the first 30 sec and followed by an acquisition every 10 sec. Capture 5 sec of DCE-CT data and then press the start button on the injection pump.\nAfter the DCE-CT scan perform a volumetric anatomical micro-CT scan.\nCapture anatomical CT images between 48 and 72 hr post-injection of CT-liposomes, using the same volumetric CT settings as described in steps 3.5.",
    "Reconstruct the anatomical CT and DCE-CT data using the GPU-reconstruction software.\n\t\nLoad the image into the reconstruction software. Select the region of interest to be reconstructed by drawing an ROI over the image using a mouse. Set the save location and filename for the reconstructed imaged and select the output file type as '.mat'.\n\t\tNOTE: The software will automatically set the reconstructed voxel size to 0.153 x 0.153 x 0.153 mm3 for anatomical scans and 0.153 x 0.153 x 0.462 mm3 for DCE-CT scans. Click the 'begin reconstruction' button.\nUse the pre-injection and 10 min post-injection scans of the CT-liposome to calculate the plasma volume fraction as previously described3. Furthermore, use the pre-injection and 5 min post-injection scans of iohexol to calculate the interstitial volume fraction as previously described7.\nObtain time intensity curves (TICs) by importing the DCE-CT data into software that provides the ability to identify a region of interest (ROI) within the tumor volume. Then calculate the mean CT enhancement in the ROI as a function of time. In this experiment custom software was developed to identify a ROI and calculate the TIC.\nObtain quantitative estimates of perfusion and vascular permeability by fitting measured TICs using a two-compartment tracer kinetic model. Fitting can be performed using DCE-CT analysis software and use the apriori estimates of the plasma volume fraction and interstitial volume fractions as fixed parameters in the two-compartment tracer kinetic model. Use previously reported methods to obtain apriori estimates of the plasma and interstitial volume fractions14.\n4. Spatial Measurements of Tumor Interstitial Fluid Pressure",
    "To measure IFP connect the 25 G spinal needle to the pressure transducer and to the IFP acquisition system through 50 cm of PE20 polyethylene tubing. Flush the entire system with a heparin sulfate/saline solution (1:10). Sterilize the needle with 70% isopropyl before use.\nTurn on the acquisition system and launch the IFP acquisition software and load the settings files to calibrate the system to acquire IFP measurements in mmHg. Click the acquire button to continuously collect IFP data.\nPerform IFP measurements between 48 and 72 hr post-injection of CT-liposomes (this corresponds to the approximate time of peak accumulation of the CT-liposomes in the tumor), using the methods described in 4.8. Attach the IFP needle to the CT-IFP robot.\nPerform calibration scans to align the coordinate systems for the CT-IFP robot and the CT scanner. Add the fiducial marker attachment to the CT-IFP robot and perform a four volumetric CT scan with the fiducial marker in four different positions.\n\t\nLaunch the CT-IFP robot controller software, initialize the robot, and move the robot to the three positions by entering the x,y,z targeting positions and clicking the 'go' button.\nTake a CT scan at the following x,y,z coordinates: (1) 0,0,0; (2) -10,0,0; (3) 0,7,0; and (4) 0,0,10. Select a 90 kV, 10 mA, 16 sec scan using the CT-scanner software and press 'Start' to initiate the scan. Reconstruct the scan as described in 3.10.\nLaunch the CT-IFP robot alignment software. Click the 'add' button loaded in the 'Registration Data' region and select the four reconstructed registration scans obtained in 4.3, then click 'open'.\n\tNOTE: The pixel location of the fiducial marker will automatically be entered into the software.",
    "Click the 'Calculate Transform' button and then click the 'Apply Transform' button. This generates alignment data that will be used to convert the CT-IFP robot coordinate system to the CT scanner coordinate system. After the calibration is complete, attach the animal platform to the CT-IFP robot.\nAnesthetize each mouse using 2% isoflurane mixed with medical air or oxygen and confirm by pinching the toe and observing no reaction. Immobilize animal on the CT-IFP robot platform and position the mouse such that the tumor is accessible to the CT-IFP robot system. Immobilize the tumor using tape such that it does not move during IFP needle insertion.\nPerform an anatomic micro-CT scan prior to inserting the IFP needle. Reconstruct the CT data using the steps described in 3.10.\nLoad the pre-needle insertion CT data into the CT-IFP robot alignment software. Adjust the window and level to visualize the tumor. Click on the rim of the tumor in any image, then click on a second rim location.\n\tNOTE: The software will calculate a series of positions along a linear line between the two positions. Note the x, y and z coordinates for a series of 5 to 8 evenly spaced positions from the list.\nPrepare the IFP system by flushing the needle with heparin saline solution prior to insertion.\nEnter the first pre-determined needle positions into the x,y,z, into the CT-IFP robot control software and press-move to 'go' button to move the robot to the desired position. Click the 'Insert Needle' button to insert the needle into the tissue.",
    "After inserting the needle ensure good fluid communication between the IFP needle and the tissue by pinching and releasing the PE20 tubing, noting that the IFP measurement increases and returns to pre-pinching value on the IFP acquisition software. Reject measurements that do not return to baseline.\nAcquire an anatomic CT scan with the needle inserted, then click the 'Retract Needle' button on the CT-IFP robot control software to retract the needle from the tissue. Reject any IFP measurements where the IFP value does not return to the pre-needle insertion value after withdrawal of the needle. This signifies the needle may have been clogged during the measurement. Repeat steps 4.8 to 4.10 for each needle position.\nDetermine the needle position within the tumor volume by calculating the x, y, and z positions of the needle port relative to the center of mass of the tumor volume as identified in the post-insertion volumetric CT scan of the needle.\nReturn animals to their cage after all measurements are complete. Do not leave animals unattended, and take care to observe them until consciousness has been regained and they are able to maintain sternal recumbency.\nSubscription Required.
