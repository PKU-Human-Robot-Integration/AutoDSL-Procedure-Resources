    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe step-by-step protocol helps you to segment and acquire muscle fiber morphometric data using the IPP6 software. In the second subsection, the Excel spreadsheet used to quantify the subpopulations of muscle fibers is detailed. The excel spreadsheet is available as the Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2160-Mmc1.xlsx] (Excel spreadsheet designed for the analysis of primary morphometric measurements obtained from fibers segmentation, related to steps 19 and 20). Finally, we exemplify the alternatives to demonstrate the morphometric data generated by MusMA (supplemental information 2[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2160-Mmc1.xlsx] – Figure S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2160-Mmc2.pdf]).\nMuscle fiber segmentation and variables acquisition\nTiming: 5 min per image; about 25 min for each sample\nIn this step, you perform the segmentation of individual muscle fibers (that is, the delimitation of their contour), followed by the acquisition of the variables of size (Area) and shape that characterize the morphometry of each muscle fiber.\nThe following variables of shape are extracted: Aspect (reports the ratio between the major axis and the minor axis of the ellipse equivalent to the object, as determined by Major Axis/Minor Axis; Area/box (reports the ratio between the area of each object, and the area of its imaginary bounding box); Radius Ratio (reports the ratio between Max Radius and Min Radius for each object); Roundness (roundness of the fiber, as determined by the following formula: perimeter2/(4∗pi∗area). These four measurements are used to calculate the Muscle Fiber Irregularity Index (MusFII), as detailed in the step 19, item c.\nWe suggest using at least 50 muscle fibers from 5 different fields from each sample.\nOpen H&E image in the IPP6 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2160-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Interface of IPP6 and muscle fiber segmentation protocol\n(A) The arrow indicates the icon to open images.",
    "(B) Select the ‘Irregular Area of Interest’ tool, as indicated by the arrow. After selecting AOI, the cursor changes to a magic wand symbol. A little box of options opens (yellow bow), with two adjustable variables, to know: ‘range’ and ‘smooth’.\n(C) The magical wand allows the segmentation of the fibers, as indicated by the red line in the fiber pointed by the black arrow.\n(D) After properly segmenting the first muscle fiber, press the ctrl key while left clicking on the next fiber to be segmented. This will fix the fiber just segmented, and the outline of the cell turns into green.\n(E) A representative image with various fixed cells is shown in the detail.\n(F) By clicking on ‘Convert AOI(s) to Objects’, segmented fibers are converted to numbered objects.\nClick on the ‘irregular AOI’ icon (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nA small window opens (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C – yellow box) and the mouse pointer changes to a magic wand.\nAdjust the ‘magic wand’ range – refers to the number of gray levels (we suggest values from 10 to 30 to start the segmentation);\nAdjust the ‘magic wand’ smooth – refers to post-filtering of the outline (we suggest values from 3 to 5; the same value need to be used to all muscle fibers) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nTo define the outline of the first fiber, left click inside the fiber. A red outline delimiting the object appears.\nYou may slightly alter the position of the left click inside the muscle fiber until the outline fits the fiber properly (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCritical: the adequate marking of the limit of the muscular fibers is essential for the acquisition of accurate measurements of area and shape.",
    "When the fiber outline is adequate, press ctrl in the keyboard and left click inside the next fiber to be analyzed. At this point, the contour of the first selected fiber will change to green (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nCritical: do not keep the ctrl button pressed while you are only adjusting the correct outline of the fiber. Unfortunately, the Image Pro Plus 6.0 does not allow you to undo the errors if you have made a mistake in the segmentation, so you will have to restart the segmentation if any fiber is incorrectly segmented.\nRepeat the previous step until all fibers from the image are outlined in green.\nRight click in any place of the image when all fibers were segmented. Since the segmentation is based on the difference in intensity of the muscle fiber pixels and the image background, not all image fibers can be segmented.\nClick on the count/size icon (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Then, click on Measure → Select measurements (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2160-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Starting the variable acquisition\n(A) The arrow indicates the ‘count/measure’ tool.\n(B) After clicking on ‘measure’ (black arrow), a new window opens, allowing you to choose the measurements of interest, as indicated by yellow arrow (Area, Area/box, Aspect, Radius Ratio and Roundness). The measure button (red arrow) then calculate all variables to each muscle fiber.\n(C) In count/size’ window, click on File, then ‘data to clipboard’.\n(D) Representative data pasting raw data from IPP6 in an excel file.\nSelect the following measurements: Area, Area/box, Aspect, Radius ratio and Roundness. Then, click ok.\nAt the count/size window: Edit → Convert AOI(s) to object(s) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).",
    "At this point, the contour of all segmented fibers will become red, and each fiber will be numbered, from the top to the bottom of the image (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C – right image).\nIn the count/size window: file → data to clipboard (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Paste data from the first image in an Excel spreadsheet (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nRepeat steps 1–15 for all images of all participants (animals) and experimental groups.\nSave this spreadsheet as ‘MusMA raw data’; create a tab to each condition to facilitate pasting your data to the spreadsheet of analysis (described in the next section).\nIn the ‘Measure’ menu → Snap measurements to save the image with the segmented fibers.\nUsing MusMA to analyze the raw data\nTiming: 30 min to 1 h\nThese steps describe how to analyze raw data using a specific Excel spreadsheet designed for MusMA (Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2160-Mmc1.xlsx]). The first worksheet is named ‘normal fibers and settings’, and is used to set the parameters of normal (or ‘regular’) fibers as well as the thresholds that define the different quadrants according to fibers’ morphometry. The other two worksheets (named ‘Condition 1’ and ‘Condition 2’) are identical and intended for the analysis of the morphometry of the muscle fibers from different groups (or conditions). You may generate as many ‘condition’ worksheets as necessary considering the number of experimental groups.\nSetting the ellipse of normal muscle fibers and the thresholds to separate the subpopulations of muscle fibers.\nDownload and open the ‘MusMA clear.xls’ excel file (Figure S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2160-Mmc2.pdf]).\nIn the ‘normal fibers and settings’ worksheet, paste data of at least 50 normal fibers (from the control condition) in the yellow marked cells (beginning in C11 through G11; Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2160-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Graphical resolution of MusMA\nStarting the analysis.",
    "(A) Layout of MusMA clear.xls file. The arrow indicates the location where you may paste raw data to set the normal ellipse (beginning in C13 to G13).\n(B) Setting the normal ellipse. Set the number of standard deviations related to the average of Area and MusFII (black arrow), to adjust the normal ellipse. Then, adjust the thresholds to define the quadrants. Paste raw data of all conditions in the box pointed by the blue arrow. Then, alter the number standard deviations (red cells in S column) to define the quadrants that separate the subpopulations of fibers.\n(C) The image shows the final settings of the normal ellipse (left graph) and the thresholds (right graph). (D) ‘Condition’ worksheets. ‘Condition 1’ worksheet refers to an experimental condition or group. Paste raw data in the C13 cell, as indicated by the black arrow. Column A indicates different experiments (or animals or individuals). Per condition, we estimated 500 fibers to each experiment / animal / individual (column B), and 10 independent experiments / animals / individuals.\n(E) The Area x MusFII dot blot of Area x MusFII is automatically generated. You must generate, from the duplication of the 'Condition 2' tab, as many 'condition' tabs as necessary considering the number of experimental conditions.\n(F) Bar and pie charts for the percentage of muscle fibers with each phenotype.\nThe MusFII, in dark yellow cells (cell H11 down), is automatically generated (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, arrow).\nCells from H11 down (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, orange cells on the left) are marked with an ‘X’ and have the mathematical formula to automatically calculate MusFII.",
    "After pasting raw data, delete the formula (i.e., delete the “X) in those lines that do not contain any data. Attention: this step needs to be done for all occurrences in cells marked with an “X”, both in “normal fibers and settings” and all “Conditions” datasheets.\nCritical: The deletion of the \"X\" in cells where there is no muscle fiber data is essential for the correct plotting of the graphs.\nAdjust the number of standard deviations related to the average of fibers’ area (P2 cell) and MusFII (P3 cell) to set the ellipse surrounding ‘normal fibers’ (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, arrow).\nCritical: to set the normal ellipse (as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B), adjust the number of standard deviations so that the ellipse fits as many normal fibers as possible, while leaving the smallest possible empty area inside. Avoid ellipses that are over-area (i.e., too much white area due to excessive number of standard deviations) or too small (i.e., too many control fibers outside the ellipse because of too low number of deviations).\nTo adjust the thresholds that set the quadrants in the MusMA plot, paste data from all experimental conditions in the light-yellow cells below ‘setting the thresholds’ (from Z11 through AD11) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C, black arrow).\nThe MusFII is automatically generated in the AE11 down (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nThrough altering the number of standard deviations in S4, S6 and S8 cells (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C, blue arrow), adjust the thresholds that define each quadrant in the right graph.\nAll parameters used to set the normal population and the thresholds are automatically applied to all the conditions’ worksheets. Please, do not change any cells in the spreadsheet, except for those whose font color is marked in red (cells: P2, P3, S4 S6 and S8).\nData analysis and interpretation.",
    "Duplicate the \"Condition\" tab to generate a tab for each condition or experimental group.\nIn each ‘Condition’ worksheet, paste raw data in the yellow box (B13 through G13 cells down) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E, arrow). Column A is specific to each experiment / animal / patient. We estimated 500 fibers per experiment / animal / patient, for 10 independent experiment / animal / patient.\nMusFII is automatically calculated in H11 down (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E).\nAfter pasting data from morphometric measurements, the MusMA Excel spreadsheet automatically generates an Area x MusFII plot and calculates the percentage of muscle fibers in each subpopulation (i.e., normal, irregular, atrophic, or hypertrophic).\nResults and graphs are also automatically done. Main graph is a scatter plot (x, y) of area and MusFII of individual fibers (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F; Figure S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2160-Mmc2.pdf]B). Two additional graphs are generated: a bar graph corresponding to the average ± standard deviation (and a pie chart."
