    "Experimental procedures followed the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Society for Neuroscience Guidelines and Policies. Protocols for experimental and behavioral procedures were approved by the University of Utah Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Construction of the Microinjectrode for Stimulation and Recording (Figure 1a)\nMeasure the length of the cannula and the probe (in this example a nanosensor). Probe must be longer than the cannula by the length it is to protrude from the cannula tip (depending on probe design) plus approximately 2 cm.\nUnder a magnifier or a microscope (~10x magnification), load the probe into the cannula; if possible a back-loading is preferable to protect the tip of the probe.\nNOTE: This step, performed manually, is challenging. It is recommended to practice with a microelectrode under a magnifying glass before attempting with an actual experimental probe.\nPass the cannula (containing the probe) through the top ferrule, T-junction, and bottom ferrule.\nIf the probe is just a single wire without any attachments, back-load it into the canula and insert the assembly into the T-junction from the bottom ferrule. Top of cannula (flat-end side) should be positioned in the middle of the T-junction, within the bottom but not the top ferrule. The experimental probe or biosensor should protrude above the top of the top ferrule.\nNOTE: Custom-made ferrules can also be made by drilling a hole in the ferrule plugs using micro drill bits, the size of the hole being based upon the diameter needed for tightening the cannula to the T-junction.\nUse the ferrule wrench to tighten the ferrules on the top and bottom of the T-junction. Do not over-tighten. A small piece of tubing can be added to strengthen the electrode support within the top ferrule.",
    "Solder gold pins to each of the probe terminals (signal, ground, etc.), according to the specifications of the probe.\nAdjust relative position of probe and cannula. Measure the distance that the probe is protruding from cannula under magnification, and adjust manually from the top end (probe can slide freely within ferrules).\nAdd epoxy glue between the gold pins and the top ferrule to attach the probe to the ferrule.\nUnscrew the top ferrule to retract probe inside cannula. Visually confirm that the probe is fully within the cannula under magnification.\nAttach the injectrode to the microdrive.\n2. Construction of the Microinjectrode for Drug Infusion (Figure 1b)\nAttach the \"non-beveled\" or flat-end of the cannula to the bottom of the T-junction using a ferrule. Use the ferrule wrench to tighten the ferrule.\nAttach a small piece of capillary tubing (~1.5 cm) to the top of the T-junction by passing it through the standard ferrule. Tighten with a ferrule wrench.\nBack-load the microelectrode through the capillary tubing, T-junction, cannula and corresponding ferrules.\nMake sure that the back-end of the electrode protrudes less than 1 cm from the back of the capillary tubing, and the tip of the electrode protrudes from the cannula at the desired distance on the bottom side. Electrode position can be manually adjusted from the top-end.\nSolder a gold pin to the microelectrode terminal.\nAdd epoxy glue between the gold pin and the top ferrule to attach the microelectrode to the ferrule.\nUnscrew the top ferrule to retract the probe inside cannula. Visually confirm that the microelectrode is fully retracted into the cannula.\n3. Construction of the Microfluidic Circuit (Figure 2)",
    "Place a breadboard on a stable surface. Place the two three-way valves parallel to the longest sides of the breadboard, about 6 in. apart with one port (the one that is always open) facing each other. Use screws to fix the valves to the breadboard.\nPlace a ruler next to the valves (to measure and track movement of fluids inside the capillary tubing).\nLoad a mixture of 1:1 low viscosity oil and food coloring (marker) into the gastight syringe and place in the Marker pump. Cut one piece of capillary tubing, and use standard ferrules and Luer-lock connectors to connect the syringe to one of the ports on the Input valve. This is the \"marker line\".\nCut a short piece of capillary tubing for the \"ruler line\". Use standard ferrules to tighten to the facing ports of the valves.\nCut two longer pieces of capillary tubing to connect the Output valve to the microinjectrode, and to connect the Drug pump to the Input valve (use standard ferrules).\nNOTE: The length of these two lines depends on the experimental setup, one must be long enough to reach from the infusion apparatus to the animal, and the other one from the Drug pump to the Input valve. Use a cleaving stone to cut the capillary tubing.\n4. Mounting the Microinjectrode to the Microdrive (Figure 3)\nMake sure the microelectrode/experimental probe is retracted in the cannula prior to mounting.\nNOTE: The guide tube should be in position in microdrive.\nAttach a custom-made adapter to the microinjectrode.\nTop-load the microinjectrode through the guide tube and secure it to the adapter using screws.\nMeasure the microdrive position (depth) at which the microinjectrode protrudes from the guide tube, then retract it ~1 cm to prepare for insertion.",
    "For microinfusion experiments, connect the \"brain line\" to the unused T-junction opening of the microinjectrode. Use a standard ferrule and tighten with the ferrule wrench.\n5. Flushing and Preparation of the Microfluidic System\nPosition the microdrive with the microinjectrode over a waste beaker.\nLoad chlorhexidine (e.g., nolvasan; dissolved at 20 g/L) into the 1 mL gastight syringe and place it in the Drug pump. Turn the flow direction of the valves such that fluid goes from the Drug pump through the valve to the valve line and out the \"brain line\".\nFlush the circuit with chlorhexidine using a low flow rate (50-200 µL/min) for a minimum of 10 min. Repeat steps 5.2 through 5.3 with sterile saline and then air.\nNOTE: It is important to check for leaks at this stage. Gently apply lint-free wipes at the junctions to help reveal any liquid leaks through the ferrules.\nLoad the drug in the 500 µL gastight syringe, compress the air and then place in the Drug pump. Flow at 50 µL/min until a few drops flow from the microinjectrode.\nSoak the guide tube in chlorhexidine (dissolved at 20 g/L) for 15 min.\nTurn the direction of the Output valve towards the \"flushing line\". Advance the Marker pump until a clear edge of color and oil is observed on the ruler line. Make sure there is always oil between the drug and the color in order to not mix the two water-soluble materials and lose the sharp edge between them. Mark the starting position of this oil/dye line (with a piece of tape or marker).\nTurn the direction of the Output valve towards the brain line.\n6. Performing Recording or an Infusion Experiment",
    "NOTE: Animal handling steps will vary depending on the lab and experiment. The following steps are to be performed after the necessary surgical set up and preparation has been performed to expose the dura. Following the experiment, all necessary post-procedure steps must be performed in accordance with institutionally approved protocols.\nAttach the microdrive to the recording chamber. Lower the guide tube to penetrate the dura.\nNOTE: The guide tube should not penetrate any further than the dura in order to avoid damaging the cortex.\nLower the microinjectrode to about 2 mm above the site for recording/injection in the brain.\nTighten the top ferrule (protruding microelectrode/biosensor) and connect the gold pins to the recording system. Keep advancing the microinjectrode to the target site.\nNOTE: Remember to include the distance that the microelectrode extends beyond the cannula in the calculations.\nFor infusion experiments, use the manual microsyringe pump to move the column of oil by 1 cm every 3 min (~60 nL/min). Once the desired volume has been infused, switch the Output valve towards the flushing line.\nNOTE: The volume infused will vary based on model species and brain area targeted. Faster flow rates may damage neural tissue.\nWhen the experiments are complete, retract the microinjectrode within the guide tube (leave the probe protruded). Then remove the microdrive for flushing. Flush the microfluidic system as described in steps 5.1-5.5. to prepare for reuse.\nNOTE: In our experience, the microinjectrode will last for several uses if proper care is taken. Electrophysiological recording quality drops faster than the capability of injection."
