    "All experiments are conducted in accordance with the protocols described by the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Animals and were approved by ALS TDI’s institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC).\n1. Animals, Housing, and Study Design\nNote: The SOD1-G93A mouse colony was derived from the high copy B6SJLTgN(SOD1G93A)1Gur strain originally produced by Gurney et al. 7. The colony is currently being maintained by crossing transgenic C57BL/6-SJL males with wild-type C57BL/6-SJL F1 females. The F1 animals are generated by crossing SJL males with B6 females. Mice are shipped to ALS TDI weekly at 35–45 days of age.\nAllow mice at least one week to acclimate to the animal facility (12-hr light/dark cycle at a temperature of 18-23 °C and 40-60% humidity) before assigning to a study.\nHouse male SOD1-G93A mice one mouse per cage, since group housed males tend to fight. House female SOD1-G93A mice up to two per cage. Provide environmental enrichment, in the form of plastic huts. Provide food and water ad libitum, unless the mice are part of a study requiring drug administration in drinking water/food. In these cases, ration and record food and water.\nBegin a drug-efficacy study around age day 50 and include 64 litter-matched gender-balanced mice (32 per cohort). Finally, ensure that the researchers conducting the studies are blinded to the experimental conditions.\n\tNote: It is recommended that a typical drug-efficacy study starts at age day 50 however based on the type of therapeutic intervention it might be preferable to start the study earlier or later.\n\tNote: A study with 32 mice per cohort is powered to detect gender-specific drug-effects. If no gender-specific comparisons are required, 24 mice per cohort should suffice to detect overall drug-effects.\n2. Body Weight",
    "Record body weights for all mice in studies daily with a precision of one tenth of a gram. Note: Body weight is a sensitive indicator of disease progression and of any malaise that might result from chronic drug treatment.\nMouse body weights vary considerably during the course of a day, being higher in the mornings, thus record them around the same time every day.\n3. Neurological Scoring System (NeuroScore)\nAssess neurological scores (NS) for each mouse daily by observing the mouse under the following three conditions performed sequentially: a) the mouse is suspended by its tail, b) the mouse is allowed to walk, and after the onset of paresis c) the mouse is placed on its side.\n\t\nFor the tail suspension test, hold the mouse approximately 1.5” from the base of the tail over the wire top of their home cage for 1-2 sec, away from the food basin, while observing the hindlimbs. Repeat the suspension test 3 times and record the most consistent outcome.\nFor the walking test, place the mouse on a clean surface that provides some traction and a walking distance of 25 cm (e.g., a paper towel taped down to prevent slipping). Allow the mouse to walk a total of 75 cm (3X length of the paper towel) while observing its gait.\nFor the “righting reflex” test, place the mouse on its left or right side and using a stop-watch measure the time it takes to right itself up unassisted from both sides. Note: Only one trial of this test is required.\nDetermine the NS of each hindlimb (left or right) independently on a scale from 0 to 4. Note: For instance a score of 0, 1 indicates that the left hindlimb NS is 0, while the right hindlimb NS is 1.",
    "Assign neurological scores (0-4) corresponding to the following set of observations (summary provided in Table 1):\n\t\nAssign NS 0 (Pre-symptomatic) if the following is observed: When the mouse is suspended by the tail, the hindlimb presents a normal splay i.e., it is fully extended away from the lateral midline and it stays in this position for 2 sec or longer. When the mouse is allowed to walk, normal gait is observed.\nAssign NS 1 (First symptoms) if the following is observed: When the mouse is suspended by the tail, the hindlimb presents an abnormal splay, i.e., it is collapsed or partially collapsed towards lateral midline OR it trembles during tail suspension OR it is retracted/clasped. When the mouse is allowed to walk, normal OR slightly slow gait is observed.\nAssign NS 2 (Onset of paresis) if the following is observed: When the mouse is suspended by the tail, the hindlimb is partially OR completely collapsed, not extending much. (There might still be joint movement). When the mouse is allowed to walk, the hindlimb is used for forward motion however the toes curl downwards at least twice during a 90 cm walk OR any part of the foot is dragging along cage bottom/table. When the mouse is placed on its left AND right side, it is able to right itself within 10 sec from BOTH sides.",
    "Assign NS 3 (Paralysis) if the following is observed: When the mouse is suspended by the tail, there is rigid paralysis in the hindlimb OR minimal joint movement. When the mouse is allowed to walk there is forward motion however the hindlimb is NOT being used for forward motion. When the mouse is placed on its left AND right side, it is able to right itself within 10 sec from BOTH sides. Note: Rarely, after the onset of paralysis, urine moisture might appear on the hindlimbs.  Left untreated urine moisture might result to urine “burn” and skin lesions.  Treat urine moisture by clipping the hair, apply warm water soaks to remove the urine, and gently blot dry. If skin lesions are present apply antibiotic ointment.\nAssign NS 4 (Humane end-point) if the following is observed: When the mouse is suspended by the tail, there is rigid paralysis in the hindlimbs. When the mouse is allowed to walk, there is no forward motion. When the mouse is placed on its left AND right side it is NOT able to right itself within 10 sec from EITHER side. i.e., absence of righting reflex.\n4. Data Entry and Analysis\nDuring the course of a drug efficacy study, enter data collected for each mouse into a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) or into a commercially available spreadsheet software.\n\tNote: The ALS TDI-developed LIMS software is a central repository for all data collected from internal studies, making these data conveniently accessible over time for ALS TDI investigators. LIMS tracks any individual mouse, with its unique ID, back to its lineage, body weight or neurological score on all study days, and includes any other observations noted during its lifetime. LIMS ultimately generates a spreadsheet which is used for subsequent analyses.",
    "Upon the completion of a drug efficacy study, i.e., when all mice reach the humane end-point, use spreadsheet software (see Table of Materials) to compute the combined NS for each mouse, for each day by averaging the left and right hindlimb NS. Next, compute the median age at each NS for each mouse and the number of days each mouse spends at a particular NS.\nAnalyze overall changes in NS over time by importing the data from the spreadsheet software to the statistical software (see Table of Materials). Fit these data using a model of ordinal logistic regression which estimates the expected NS, with median age at NS and drug-treatment as effects in the regression. Using the log-rank chi square test estimate the effect likelihood probability and determine whether the drug-treatment effect on NS progression is statistically significant (see Supplemental Code File for step-by-step instructions).\n\tNote: A p-value <0.05 is considered statistically significant.\n\tNote: This method of statistical analysis respects the ordinal nature of the NS data and the variable nature of the NS trajectories for individual mice. It is preferred because individual NS trajectories can be markedly different resulting in NS time-associated group averages that are not sufficiently reflective of NS responses. In addition, in some cases NS can fluctuate, particularly when in the zero-to-one range.\nFinally, use graphing software (see Table of Materials) to generate “Ordinal Expected NS vs Median Age at NS” graphs for drug-treated and control animals (Figure 2; see Supplemental Code File for step-by-step instructions). Use these graphs to conveniently estimate shifts between drug-treated and control groups by interpolating from the y-axis the median age of disease onset (i.e., NS 2) on the x-axis.",
    "Note: The difference in median age between the two groups represents a drug-induced shift and is treated as a practical measure of the magnitude of effect.\n\tNote: Rightward shifts in the expected NS vs. median age curve indicate slowed symptomatic disease progression. Conversely, leftward shifts in the expected NS vs. median age curve indicate accelerated symptomatic disease progression.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
