    "1. Participant and Postmortem Brain Set-Up\nNOTE: All images were acquired using a 3 T MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil and all MRI scanning was performed at RT, approximately 20 °C. All participants were right handed and gave written informed consent. Each participant was in good health with no history of neurological disorders. The experimental protocol was approved and follows the guidelines of York University Human Participants Review Committee.\nAsk each participant fill out and sign a patient consent form that details MRI safety guidelines and the neuro-imaging protocol.\nFor each participant, place earplugs in each ear and secure their head with pads to minimize head motion.\nFor post-mortem brain imaging, make sure the brain is fixed prior to neuroimaging and is contained within a bag or container that fits within the MRI head-coil. Place the postmortem brain in the head-coil with its z-axis (superior to inferior) aligned with the bore of the scanner. The brainstem (posterior) should face towards the foot of the scanner bed.\nPlace vacuum cushion hands around the post-mortem brain for additional support.\n2. Localizing and Prescribing the Subcortex\nNOTE: The thalamus is a dual lobed structure located near the center of the brain situated between the midbrain and the cerebral cortex. Located within the dorsal thalamus, the human LGN is a small subcortical structure that extends a maximum of ~10 mm.\nTo register a new participant, open the MRI imaging software and click on the Patient tab in the upper left hand corner. Then click on Register.\nFill in the appropriate patient information, and then click on the Exam tab.",
    "To obtain a localizer scan, click on the Exam Explorer tab to create a new protocol. Observe the set-up window on the screen, click the Routine tab, and enter the following parameters: acquisition time 28 sec, acquisition matrix 160 × 160, 1 slice, 1.6 mm thick isotropic voxel size, FOV = 260 mm, FoV phase = 100%, slice resolution = 69%, phase and slice partial phase Fourier = 6/8, TR = 3.15 ms, TE = 1.37 msec, Flip Angle = 8°.\nOverlay the slice selection box used for acquiring the PD images over the localizer covering the subcortical nuclei within the thalamus as well as surrounding structures (Figure 4).\n3. High-resolution Structural Parameters\nCreate a new protocol for obtaining high-resolution PD-weighted scans. In the set-up window on the screen, click the Routine tab, and enter the following parameters in the coronal orientation: acquisition time 179 sec, acquisition matrix 512 × 512, 0.3 × 0.3 × 1 mm3 voxel size, TR = 3.25 sec, TE = 32 msec, flip angle = 120°, interleaved slice acquisition, FoV read = 160 mm, FoV phase = 100%, parallel imaging (GRAPPA) with an acceleration factor of 2.\n\t\nUse a Turbo Spin Echo sequence, with an Echo Train Length of 5. The first echo at 32 msec is the effective echo for this sequence. Reduce the bandwidth (BW) to the minimum possible, 40 Hz/pixel, to maximize the SNR. To reduce scan duration, choose 18 slices, each 1 mm thick, with an FOV = 160 mm. This slab provides enough coverage of subcortical regions of interest.\n\t\tNOTE: For reliable identification of subcortical structures, acquire 5 runs with the above parameters. The total scan duration is only ~15 min (Figure 5). Fat-saturation was not employed.",
    "In post-mortem brain imaging, reliable identification of subcortical structures can be observed in just one scan with the total duration of only ~3 min following the same scanning protocol as in 3.1 (Figure 6).\n4. Image Analysis\nNOTE: To analyze the MRI data, use the freely available FMRIB's Software Library (FSL) package available for download at (https://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/[href=https://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/]).\nOpen a terminal window, and convert the raw DICOM files from the scanner for each PD volume to a NIfTI format with a DICOM to NIfTI converter. A number of which are freely available for download (e.g., https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron[href=https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron]). In the command line, type dcm2nii followed by the directory of each PD weighted image run.\nIn a terminal window obtain the parameters of the original PD scan. Type fslinfo in the command line followed by the PD scan in NIfTI format.\nCreate a high-resolution blank image target volume that has twice the resolution and half the voxel size given by the parameters from fslinfo from the original PD scan. The order of data inputs for this command are as follows:\n\tfslcreatehd <xsize> <ysize> <zsize> <tsize> <xvoxsize> <yvoxsize> <zvoxsize> <tr> <xorigin> <yorigin> <zorigin> <datatype> <headername>\n\tNOTE: For example, if the original PD scan with the following parameters as described in 3.1 are collected (i.e., 512 × 512 matrix, 18 slice, 0.3 × 0.3 × 1 mm3 voxel size, TR = 3.25 s), type the following into the command window:\n\tfslcreatehd 1024 1024 36 1 0.15 0.15 0.5 3.25 0 0 0 4 blankhr.nii.gz\nDefine the transformation using an identity matrix. Type in any text editor program a text file saved as 'identity.mat' that looks like this:\n\t0 0 0\n\t1 0 0\n\t0 1 0\n\t0 0 1",
    "Use the flirt command to apply the transformation, upsampling each original PD weighted run to double the total resolution from a 512 to a 1024 matrix, and halve the voxel size in each dimension resulting in a resolution of 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.5 mm3. In a terminal window for each PD volume, type the following flirt command changing the original and output names per run:\n\tflirt -interp sinc -in originalPD.nii.gz -ref blankhr.nii.gz -applyxfm -init identity.mat -out highresPD.nii.gz\n\tNOTE: Where originalPD.nii.gz is the source volume, blankhr.nii.gz is the desired output resolution, and highresPD.nii.gz is the name of the output volume.\nMove all the high-resolution images to a new folder, and navigate to it in a terminal window.\nFor each participant, concatenate all the upsampled PD images into a single 4D file using fslmerge. In a terminal window type:\n\tfslmerge -t concat_highresPD *.nii.gz\n\tNOTE: This creates a 4D file called concat_highresPD.nii.gz.\nMotion correct the concatenated file using mcflirt 10 . This tool allows for an automated robust registration for linear (affine) inter and inter-modal brain images. Select a 4-stage correction, which utilizes sinc interpolation (internally) as a further optimization pass for greater accuracy. In a terminal window type:\n\tmcflirt -in concat_highresPD -out mcf_concat_highresPD.nii.gz -stages 4 -plots\n\tNOTE: This creates a 4D file called mcf_concat_highresPD.nii.gz.\nFinally, create the 3D mean image using fslmaths. In a terminal window type:\n\tfslmaths mcf_concat_highresPD.nii.gz -Tmean mean_highresPD.nii.gz\n\tNOTE: This creates a 3D file called mean_highresPD.nii.gz that is of high quality\nVisualize the final outcome 3D high-resolution image using the fslview command. In the directory of where your image is, type the following in a terminal window:\n\tfslview mean_highresPD.nii.gz.\"",
    "Inspect intensity profiles of ROIs in question. Create an ROI using fslview (this can be a vertical line drawn across a region of the LGN for example). In fslview load the high-resolution PD image. Click on the tools tab, then click on the single image tab to enlarge the image for drawing ROIs. Then, click the File tab followed by the Create Mask tab. Draw a line in the ROI of interest. Save the ROI by clicking File, then the Save As. Repeat the line masks for multiple areas within the ROI for intensity comparisons and other ROIs in question.\nUse AFNI's 3dmaskdump command to analyze the resulting intensity of the image. In the directory of where the images are, use the following command in a terminal window to extract the image intensities and location (given as result_mask.txt) of your ROI mask:\n\t3dmaskdump -o result_mask.txt -noijk -xyz -mask ROI_linemask.nii.gz PDaverage_image.nii.gz\nSubscription Required.
