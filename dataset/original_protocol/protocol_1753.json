Sterilize abdomen skin with 75 % alcohol. Inject each mouse with 1 mL of starch broth intraperitoneally (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Macrophages will greatly concentrate in mice’s abdominal cavity, and reach to peak within 2–4 days after injection.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1342-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Collection of mouse peritoneal macrophages\n(A) Intraperitoneally injection of starch broth.\n(B) Collection of mouse peritoneal macrophages.\n(C) Flow cytometry analysis of macrophages.\nEuthanize the mice on day 3 by an appropriate method approved by the supervising institution. Soak the mice in 75 % alcohol for 5 min. Use sterile scissors and forceps to expose the peritoneum of the peritoneal cavity (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nInject 10 mL DMEM into the peritoneal cavity with a 20 mL syringe.\nCritical: Be careful not to puncture any organs.\nGently massage the abdomen of the mice for 10–20 s.\nCollect the peritoneal fluid containing peritoneal macrophages and transfer the cells to a sterile 50 mL centrifuge tube by a 20 mL syringe.\nRepeat step 3–5.\nCentrifuge the peritoneal exudate cells at 500×g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nNote: To remove red blood cells (RBC), re-suspend cell pellets with 3 mL RBC lysis buffer per mouse. After 5 min, add 3 mL PBS, and mix gently. Centrifuge at 500×g for 5 min, and discard the supernatants.\nWash cells with PBS and centrifuge at 500×g for 5 min, discard PBS, and re-suspend the peritoneal macrophages in 10 mL DMEM cell culture medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).",
    "Count the cells and adjust the concentration to 1 × 106 cells/mL in DMEM cell culture medium.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Inject starch broth into mouse intraperitoneally, related to step 1\nCell seeding and viral infection\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes the detailed steps for mouse macrophages infection.\nSeed 2 × 106 macrophages per well to 6-well plates containing 2 mL DMEM culture medium each well. Incubate cells at 37°C with 5% CO2.\nFour hours later, the macrophages are well adhering to the wall. Discard cell culture medium and wash gently with PBS to remove non-adherent cells. Add fresh DMEM culture medium and incubate cells at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 12–18 h.\nNote: The macrophages are available for further experiments within 48 h.\nNote: The purification of macrophages can be analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nAspirate culture medium and add 2 mL fresh DMEM culture medium containing virus (The final concentration of HSV-1 is 10 MOI).\nNote: MOI means multiplicity of infection. Thus, 10 MOI means there are 10 viral genomes for each cell.\nAt the desired time post infection, discard the medium from each well and wash with PBS buffer for 3 times.\nSamples preparation\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis section describes the protein samples preparation for Native-PAGE and SDS-PAGE.\nAdd 100 μL cold Lysis buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) per well and place the plate on ice.\nAfter 10 min, scrape and transfer the cells to 1.5 mL pre-cold centrifuge tubes. Mix the lysates gently and incubate on ice for 10–15 min.\nSpin at 12000×g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatants to new 1.5 mL pre-cold centrifuge tubes and determine the protein concentration by using a BCA Protein Assay Kit.",
    "Make sure the total protein of 100 μL cell lysate in each tube is same.\nDivide the lysate into two tubes and each tube contains 50 μL cell lysate.\nAdd 10 μL 6×SDS loading buffer to tube 1, and boil for 5–10 min.\nAdd 10 μL 6×Native-PAGE loading buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) to tube 2. Place tube 2 on ice.\nCritical: Tube 2 do not boil.\nNative-PAGE analysis of protein aggregation\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThis section describes the Native-PAGE analysis of protein aggregation.\nPre-run 7% Native Gels (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) with Native-PAGE running buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) at 45 mA for 30 min on ice (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1342-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Electrophoresis tank set up to perform Native-PAGE\n(A) Add different running buffers to different part of electrophoresis tank.\n(B) Run the Native Gels on ice.\nNote: The cathode buffer and anode buffer are different.\nLoad the tube 2 samples into gels and run the gels on ice at 25 mA for 3 h.\nCritical: The gel running time should be adjusted according to the protein size.\nTransfer the proteins to a 0.45 μm PVDF membrane in 1× Western Transfer Buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) at 300 mA for 90 min or at 30 V overnight (approximate 700 min) on ice.\nAfter blotting, disassemble the setup and place the membrane in 3% BSA for 60 min at 20°C–25°C or for 12 h at 4°C with gently agitating.\nIncubate the membrane with anti-TBK1 antibody (1:1000) at 4°C for 12 h.\nWash the membrane 3 times with 1×wash buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) at 80 rpm for 5 min at 20°C–25°C.\nDiscard the wash buffer and incubate the membrane with a secondary antibody (1:5000) at 40 rpm for 1 h at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Repeat step 27.\nQuantify the fluorescence of the secondary antibody by using a SAGECREATION MiniChemi610 or GE Amersham Imager 600 RGB (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1342-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. TBK1 form oligomers upon HSV-1 infection\nRepresentative image of TBK1 upon HSV-1 infection in Native-PAGE and SDS-PAGE.\nNote: The antibodies in step 26 and step 28 can be reused, please store at −20°C. Once you find the fluorescence of the protein in step 30 is too weak, please change the antibodies.\nCritical: If the fluorescence of the protein is too weak or too strong, we suggest adjusting the amount of proteins loading. We also suggest to run two or more gels once to test the same samples. The samples used in this experiment must be fresh.\nConfirm the total protein level by SDS-PAGE\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes the SDS-PAGE analysis of protein level.\nLoad the tube 1 samples (step 20) into a 10% SDS-PAGE. Load a pre-stained protein marker to estimate the size of the proteins.\nRun the gel at 80 V in 1×SDS-PAGE running buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) for 1 h, and then at 120 V for 1 h.\nRepeat step 24–30. Change the antibodies used in step 26 and step 28 to the indicated antibodies."
