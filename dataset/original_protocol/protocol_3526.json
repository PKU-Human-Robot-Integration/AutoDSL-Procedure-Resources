    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe three protocols below describe different immunostaining-based sorting procedures for nuclei and cells from mouse and human cortices. The sorted materials were used for three downstream applications (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and Mass Spectrometry analyses).\nNuclei isolation for TBR2+ nuclei sorting for nuclear RNA and sequencing\nTiming: 4–6 h\nSince typical cell sorting methods comprise of protease treatment for cell dissociation that can lead to unwanted effects on gene expression profile, we opted for unbiased approach to minimize biasness due to sample processing. The cell sorting protocol requires stringent reagents for cell staining, which usually lead to degradation of RNA. To eliminate such drawback, we opted for TBR2+ nuclei sorting from cortex, instead of cell sorting.\nNote: Timing is dependent on the size of the sample to be processed and sorted. Always use\nDNA LoBind tubes (Eppendorf) unless otherwise stated.\nNuclei sorting\nDirectly add 500 μL ice-cold EZ prep lysis buffer, homogenize with plastic pestle (30 times up-down, also circulating movements). Add additional 10–15 strokes until majority of tissue chunks are homogenized and no big chunks remain.\nCritical: Clean the plastic pestle with RNaseZap and then RNase-free water before using.\nCritical: Aluminum cooling block for 1.5 mL tubes (kept on ice) should be used to keep the temperature low while homogenizing to avoid RNA degradation.\nCritical: To ensure complete homogenization make sure the plastic pestle fits in the 1.5 mL tube tightly with no gap at the bottom or on the sides.\nTransfer lysate into a 2 mL tube. Add additional lysis buffer to make up to 2 mL.\nIncubate on ice for 7 min (Additional few min due to multiple samples being processed make no difference). Centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 2 mL ice-cold EZ prep lysis buffer. Incubate on ice for 7 min. Filter the lysate through 70 μm cup-type strainer into a new 2 mL tube (To remove large debris and leftover meninges). Afterwards, centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard supernatant.\nCritical: Straining lysate through 70 μm filter is crucial. Otherwise, the nuclei will be clumped after addition of NSB leading to failure of the experiment.\nResuspend in 1,800 μL NSB. Centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Discard supernatant.\nNote: Step 5 helps remove residual lysis buffer from the tube.\nResuspend in 510 μL NSB. The nuclei suspension is now ready for staining.\nOptional: A small 5 mL aliquot of the nuclei suspension can be taken and stained with DAPI to check the nuclei preparation.\nTake 10 μL as negative control for FACS gating, add 90 μL NSB and keep it on ice. Mix the remaining nuclei suspension with anti TBR2-Alexa488 conjugated antibody (eBioscience) at 1:100 dilution (Tuoc et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) and incubated for 45 min in a rotator at 4°C (in the dark). In parallel, prepare collection tubes for sorting: add 2× 1 mL NSB into 2× 15 mL falcon tubes (2 tubes per sample), vortex for 10 s, then keep on a roller mixer to coat the tubes at 4°C for at least 30 min or kept rotating until time for sorting).\nAfter staining, centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min, at 4°C. Discard Supernatant. Wash pellet once with 500 μL NSB by resuspending pellet and centrifuging at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nResuspend pellet in 500 μL NSB and proceed to the cell sorter immediately.",
    "Flow the sample through 40 μm strainer attached to the FACS tube. Perform sorting. Follow the FACS gating strategy suggested in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. Since nuclei contains lower amount of RNA than whole cell, sort at least 100,000‒200,000 nuclei for RNA to be detected by Bioanalyzer or Qubit concentration measurements. After sorting, vortex the collection tubes and keep it on ice until end of FACS.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/448-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. FACS gating strategy for mouse and human TBR2 sorting\nFirst P1 is selected to get all nuclei separated from debris, then P2 and P3 population is selected for single nuclei, rejecting doublets, or multiplets. For mouse (A), since the TBR2 population was rather smear like, instead of completely separated population, TBR2+ gating was done conservatively to make sure no TBR2- nuclei mis-sorted. This heavily depends upon sorting efficiency and accuracy of a given FACS machine. (B) Human TBR2 sorting.\nTo collect sorted nuclei in the tubes, centrifuge in a swinging bucket for 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Carefully take out liquid from top by pipetting and leave out approximately 250 μL solution containing nuclei pellet.\nCritical: Make sure to carefully remove supernatant by slow pipetting with a P200 pipette from the upper surface of the liquid to prevent significant nuclei loss, which can lead to low RNA yield.\nOptional: Perform post sort imaging of the sorted TBR2+ nuclei to validate their purity. An example is given in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/448-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Post sorting validation for sorting efficiency\nNotice that in TBR2− nuclei, there is no signal, while all TBR2+ DAPI nuclei have an Alexa 488 (green) signal, confirming 100% pure population. Scale bar, 5 μm.\nRNA isolation\nTiming: 2 h\nFor further details, see Halder et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].",
    "Add 750 μL Trizol LS reagent with the remaining 250 μL suspension. Vortex well. Transfer into 1.5 mL tube and incubate at 20°C‒25°C for 5 min.\nAdd 200 μL Chloroform, vortex vigorously for 10 s and incubate for 5 min at 20°C‒25°C. Centrifuge for 15 min for 12,000 × g at 4°C. Following centrifugation, collect the upper aqueous phase into a new 1.5 mL tube and add equal volume of 100% ethanol to the aqueous phase. Vortex.\nFollow RNA clean and concentrator-5 kit instructions, including on-column DNase treatment to purify RNA (Zymo, catalog no. R1013, instruction manual version 2.3.1, pp. 3 and 4).\nAt the last step, collect RNA into 12 μL water. Use 1 μL for measuring RNA integrity (RIN value) in Bioanalyzer with RNA 6000 pico kit (Agilent) and 1 μL for concentration measurement with Qubit RNA HS kit (Invitrogen).\nNote: Due to very low amount of RNA, it is sometimes difficult to get concentration measurement from Qubit. In that case, use concentration determined by Bioanalyzer. Typically, 28S rRNA is more prone to degradation. The RNA integrity value is usually low in RNA samples, which have the high content of 28S rRNA. The nuclear RNA prepared from progenitor cells from embryonic cortex contains a higher amount of 28S rRNA and lower amount of 18S rRNA than the RNA isolated from adult tissue in the Bioanalyzer quantification. This resulted in unmeasurable RNA integrity number (RIN). Therefore, RNA quality should also be carefully determined by checking the regions (e.g., 200‒2000 nucleotides) in the gel image where typically degraded RNA could be found. with our protocol, the degraded RNA was not seen, and the 28S rRNA is found to be in intact form (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/448-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Bioanalyzer image of sorted TBR2 nuclear RNA",
    "Notice the unusually low amount of 18S rRNA, which results in an unmeasurable RNA integrity number (RIN). However, intact 28S rRNA and no visible degraded RNA in regions between 200 and 2000 nucleotide shows no apparent RNA degradation.\nSequencing library preparation\nTiming: 1 day\nFor further details, see Halder et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]. Sequencing libraries can be prepared with any appropriate kits, but below is a simple guideline for performing standard libraries from very low input sorted nuclear RNA.\nUse 100 pg–10 ng RNA for cDNA synthesis with SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit (Takara) for optimal results. Follow instruction manual provided with the kit for cDNA synthesis with appropriate PCR cycles for avoiding over amplified library.\nAfter cDNA synthesis, prepare Illumina sequencing libraries using 1 ng cDNA with Illumina Nextera XT library preparation kit. Follow instruction manual to perform library preparation.\nNote: Takara now provides SMART-Seq v4 Ultra low input Plus kit, that includes both cDNA and Illumina sequencing library preparation reagents. In that case, Nextera XT kit is not needed.\nPerform Illumina high-throughput sequencing with minimum 50 base pair single end reads and 30 million raw reads per sample. Perform bioinformatic analysis for sequencing quality control and data analysis. After using STAR aligner (2.5.2b) for read mapping to reference genome, feature counts (Subread package v1.5.1) for generating raw read counts, DESeq2(v1.30) for normalizing raw read counts, and taking base mean >5, we detected around 20,000 genes under the above mentioned sequencing conditions.\nNuclei preparation for TBR2+ nuclei sorting and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) for epigenome profiling\nTiming: 1 day",
    "In principle, both sorted TBR2+ nuclei (above protocol) and sorted TBR2+ cells (see below protocol) can be used for ChIP-seq experiment. We experienced however that the ChIP-seq results have less background with sorted nuclei than those with sorted cells. Therefore, the sorted nuclei protocol is recommended for ChIP experiments.\nNote: Always use DNA LoBind tubes (Eppendorf) unless otherwise stated.\nAdd 250 μL of low sucrose buffer (LSB) to freshly dissected embryonic mouse cortical tissues (pool 4/5 mice tissue per replicate) in a 1.5 mL tube and homogenize with plastic pestle (30 times up-down, also in circulating movements). Add additional 10–15 strokes until majority of tissue chunks are homogenized and no large chunks remain. Keep it cold as much as possible while homogenizing by using aluminum block for 1.5 mL tubes on ice. The solution should have no tissue chunks left. Make it up to 500 μL with LSB.\nAdd 13.5 μL of 37% formaldehyde solution (to have 1% as final concentration). Keep at 20°C‒25°C for 10 min in a rotator for cross-linking.\nStop cross-linking reaction by adding 52 μL of 1.25 M glycine. Rotate for 5 min on rotator at 20°C‒25°C. Centrifuge at 2000 × g for 3 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1,000 μL LSB. Now, homogenize again using mechanical homogenizer (IKA Ultraturax T10, with S10N-5G dispersion tool) at power 3 until the suspension gets clear (10–20 s) with no visible clumps.\nCarefully layer homogenized solution on top of 6 mL high sucrose buffer (HSB) as sucrose cushion in oak ridge tubes, followed by centrifugation at ~3,148 × g in a swinging bucket rotor for 10 min at 4°C.",
    "A nuclei pellet would be visible at the bottom of the tube (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Carefully remove the supernatant by pipetting from top layer. (Recommended to use: Eppendorf E3x with 5 mL Combitips advanced for smooth pipetting). Leave less than 2 mL. Resuspend in the remaining buffer and transfer into 2 mL tube.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/448-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Oak ridge tube nuclei pellet after centrifugation\nTake note of the ring-shaped pellet forming instead of a regular pellet at the bottom.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 2000 × g in 4°C. Remove supernatant, resuspend into 610 μL PBTB (10 μL extra for negative control staining later).\nNuclei Staining for Sorting:\nNote: The nuclei staining steps must be performed on ice.\nNote: Multimedia presentation for the nuclei staining steps can be obtained from Menon et al. (2014)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] and freely accessible at PubMed Central portal.\nPool 10 μL from all tubes into a new 1.5 mL tube. Dilute accordingly for negative control.\nPrimary antibody staining: Add 1:100 TBR2+AF488 conjugated antibody. Incubate on rotator for 20 min at 4°C, together with negative control. Perform step 9 in parallel.\nCentrifuge at 2000 × g for 3 min at 4°C. Wash nuclei twice with 1 mL DPBS. Each wash entails resuspending in DPBS and centrifuging for 3 min at 2000 × g at 4°C.\nAfter washing, resuspend in 500 μL PBTB. Keep it in the dark on ice.\nFlow the sample through 40 μm strainer attached to the FACS tube. Proceed to FACS machine with the collection tubes prepared in step 9.\nCoating tubes for collecting sorted nuclei\nWhile staining with antibody, take 15 mL falcon tubes (twice the number of samples, excluding negative control). Add 1 mL of PBTB. Vortex to evenly distribute the buffer on sides of the tubes.",
    "Leave it for rolling at 4°C for the time nuclei is staining. Take them with you when are going for the sorter.\nPerform FACS sorting of TBR2 positive and negative nuclei. Use negative control prepared in step 8a to determine TBR2 expressing nuclei population. Sort minimum of 100,000‒200,000 nuclei for measurable amounts of chromatin. After sorting, perform the following to collect nuclei for ChIP:\nAfter each sorting, vortex each falcon tube slightly to collect nuclei from the sides of the tubes. Keep on ice until all samples are sorted.\nBalance the tubes before centrifuging. Centrifuge for 15 min at 3,148 × g at 4°C in a swinging bucket rotor.\nVery carefully decant the supernatant without shaking. There should be some buffer left inside. Mix the pellet with the remaining buffer and transfer into 1.5 mL tubes.\nCentrifuge again for 10,000 × g for 2 min at 4°C. Remove supernatant completely by pipetting with P200 and P10 pipettes. Flash freeze the sorted nuclei pellet in liquid nitrogen, then store at −80°C until further processing.\nChIP-seq was done according to Narayanan et al. (2015)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] and Nguyen et al. (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]. Use updated library preparation kit (NEB Next Ultra II DNA library preparation kit).\nTBR2+ cell sorting for mass spectrometry (MS) analysis of epigenetic marks\nTiming: 1 day\nThe protocol for sorted nuclei precludes isolation of cell type-specific cytosolic protein for downstream applications. We therefore established a cell preparation protocol using solution with stringent reagents (Foxp3/Transcription Factor Staining Buffer Set) for cell staining. Histones, chromatin, and proteins can be extracted from these sorted cells for mass spectrometry, western blot, and ChIP analyses. Due to the harsh fixation with the stringent solution during cell staining process, we were not successful in using these sorted cells for RNA-based investigation.",
    "Spin (i.e., 1,000 rpm for 2 min) cortical tissue in 15 mL tubes and take off supernatant.\nAdd 1,950 μL of pre-heated enzyme mix 1 (refer to solution preparation) to a maximum of 400 mg tissue. Add Protein inhibitors.\nIncubate at 37°C for 15 min in water bath (mix by hand every 2–3 min).\nPrepare fire-polished Pasteur pipettes and keep in PBS (DEPC).\nAdd 30 μL of enzyme mix 2 (refer to solution preparation) to sample.\nInvert gently to mix.\nNote: Do not vortex.\nPipette up/down with P1000 to mechanically dissociate.\nOptional: In addition to pipetting up/down, the tissue can be dissociated mechanically with a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. 10–15 up and down trituration is enough.\nStop digestion and immunocytochemistry (ICC) block by adding 2 mL 5% FCS in PBS (DEPC).\nFilter with cell strainer to eliminate clumps and debris. Collect cell suspension in a 50 mL falcon tube.\nRinse the 15 mL tube and strainer with PBS (DEPC).\nSpin for 2000 rpm (400–600 × g) for 10 min in centrifuge in tool lab.\nTake off supernatant.\nWash cells: resuspend cells in 2.0 mL PBS (DEPC), Spin for 2,000 rpm (400–600 × g) for 5 min at 4oC.\nNote: Cells may be in viscous form, but it should be well dissociated in Fixation/Permeabilization solution in next step.\nFor cell labeling with TBR2 antibody, repeat washing of cells by resuspending cells in 2.0 mL PBS (DEPC), spin for 2000 rpm (400–600 × g) for 5 min at 4°C\nCarefully pipette to take off the supernatant, otherwise you might lose the cells.\nNote: Approximately 100 μL of residual volume typically remains.\nAdd 0.5 mL of Foxp3 Fixation/Permeabilization working solution to each tube and pipette up and down to dissolve the cells.",
    "Incubate for 30 min or longer at 2°C–8°C or on ice (in the dark) with slight shaking.\nNote: Longer incubation time is possible for mouse samples, i.e., up to 18 h at 2°C–8°C in the dark.\nAdd 1 mL of 1× Permeabilization Buffer to each tube and centrifuge samples at 2000 rpm (400–600 × g) for 5 min at 4°C.\nCritical: Pipette to take off the supernatant carefully, otherwise you might lose the cells.\nNote: Approximately 100 μL of residual volume typically remains.\nResuspend pellet in remaining volume of 1× Permeabilization Buffer (usually 100 μL after decanting) plus additional 350 μL 1× Permeabilization Buffer. Thus, we have about 450 μL.\nNote: Depending on the amount of cells, you may want to scale up or down rather than 450 μL.\nSave a tube as blank/control tube.\nWithout washing, add the required amount of conjugated TBR2 antibody (1:200) to cells for detection of corresponding intracellular antigen.\nIncubate for at least 30 min at 2°C–8°C (on ice) with slight shaking and no exposure to light.\nAdd 2 mL of 1× Permeabilization Buffer to each tube and centrifuge samples at 2000 rpm (400–600 × g) for 5 min at 2°C–8°C. Pipette with 1,000 μL, then 200 μL pipettor to carefully and completely take off the supernatant, to prevent losing the cells.\nNote: You have to take off the supernatant completely. Otherwise, staining will have high background.\nRepeat the previous washing step. Resuspend stained cells in 0.5 mL PBS plus 1× complete (Protein inhibitors).\nPerform FACS as described above in steps 10 and 11 under Part I.\nCentrifuge to collect the pellet of the sorted cells. 2.5 × 106 sorted TBR2+ cells should be used for each MS sample.\nNote: Samples should be stored in −80°C if the experiment will not be done immediately."
