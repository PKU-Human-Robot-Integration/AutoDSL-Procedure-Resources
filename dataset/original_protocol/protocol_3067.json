In the\n      treatment strategy of B-1 to detect fire blight bacteria, follow step\n      11–13 for spraying and step 14–16 for swabbing.\n    \nEstablishment of the fire blight-infected plant model\nTiming:  > 24 h\n    \n      The protocol below describes how to establish a fire blight-infected plant\n      model in detail with readily available plants, for example, apple trees.\n      If available, a naturally infected sample may be used instead of an\n      experimental model.\n    \n        Collect the plant tissues such as blossom, leaf, and stem using scissors\n        or pruning shears in the desired size. A size of under 50 × 50 mm is\n        recommended for incubation in experimental conditions.\n      \n        Briefly sterilize the plant tissue by dipping it in 70% EtOH or 0.1%\n        NaClO solution for 30 s and wipe off using tissue paper.\n      \nOptional: Performing this step in a\n      sterile hood can avoid further contamination, but it isn’t essential.\n    \n        Soak the whole plant tissue or the petiole of the leaf in the LB broth\n        with 108 CFU/mL of E. amylovora using a culture dish\n        or conical tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2811-Fig1.jpg\n              Figure 1. Establishing the fire blight-infected plant model\n            \n              (A) Schematic diagram of establishing the fire blight-infected\n              plant model.\n            \n              (B) Apple tree leaves incubated in a petri dish containing LB\n              broth without (left) or with E. amylovora (right).\n            \n              (C) Apple branch with blossoms and leaves infected with fire\n              blight by incubating in petri dish containing LB broth.\n            \n              (D) An apple tree leaf infected with fire blight by dipping the\n              petiole of the leaf and the magnified images showing the symptoms\n              of fire blight.\n            \n        Incubate the plant tissue for 24 h at 26°C (Shaking isn’t required in",
    "this step.) Some black blots, one of the symptoms of fire blight, will\n        appear on the plant tissue, but it may differ depending on the plant\n        species and organs (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\n      \nNote: Another strategy is to use a brush\n      for the fire blight-infected plant model. Dilute the desired concentration\n      of bacteria (CFU/mL) with a solvent such as DI H2O. Then, apply\n      the bacteria solution twice or more on the surface of the plant tissue\n      using a brush sterilized by autoclaving or 70% EtOH. This can imitate the\n      case in which only a few E. amylovora exists on the surface of\n      plants in the early stage of fire blight.\n    \nSynthesis of B-1\nTiming:  > 3 days\n    \n      The protocol below describes the synthetic procedure of B-1. The synthesis\n      of B-1 consists of 3 steps and is based on core structure (DMHNA) which\n      was prepared according to the previously reported synthetic route (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] Organic solvents and silica are used\n      in all synthetic steps, it must be performed in the hood.

Synthetic scheme of B-1\n          The yield of each step is Compound 1; 92%, B-C; 41%, and B-1; 41%.\n        \n        Synthesis of Compound 1.\n        \nFlame dry the 10 mL round bottom flask with the stirring bar.\n            Add a mixture of DMHNA, bromoacetonitrile, potassium carbonate, and\n            N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) in the flame-dried round\n            bottom flask.\n            table:files/protocols_protocol_2811_1.csv\n            Stir the reaction and heat up at 50°C for 2 h under argon\n            atmosphere.\n          \n            Work up the reaction. Chill the reaction at 25°C and dilute with\n            50 mL of ethyl acetate (EtOAc). Using 250 mL funnel, wash the\n            reaction mixture with 50 mL of DI H2O 3 times and 50 mL\n            of brine once.",
    "Separate the organic phase into a 250 mL conical flask and add 5 g\n            of sodium sulfate. Stir the mixture for 20 min for eliminating the\n            remaining water.\n          \n            Extract the organic phase by filtration and evaporate. In the\n            filtration, further washing step helps to increase the yield of the\n            reaction.\n          \n            Purify the reaction mixture by silica column chromatography. If\n            EtOAc/Hexane (Hex) (3:7, v/v) is used as eluent, the\n            yellow fluorescent substance corresponding to Rf 0.25 on thin layer\n            chromatography (TLC) is the product.\n          \nDry the solvent and confirm using NMR and Mass spectroscopy.\n        Synthesis of B-C.\n        \nFlame dry the 10 mL Schlenk tube with the stirring bar.\n            Add a mixture of Compound 1, phenylboronic acid, trifluoroacetic\n            acid, palladium (II) trifluoroacetate, 6,6′-dimethyl-2,2′-dipyridyl,\n            and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran in the flame-dried Schlenk tube.\n            table:files/protocols_protocol_2811_2.csv\n            Stir the reaction and heat up at 80°C for 24 h under argon\n            atmosphere.\n          \nFollow the work up protocol above (Step 5. d-f).\n            Purify the reaction mixture by silica column chromatography. If\n            EtOAc/Hex (1:9, v/v) is used as eluent, the orange\n            fluorescent substance corresponding to Rf 0.25 on TLC is the\n            product.\n          \nDry the solvent and confirm using NMR and Mass spectroscopy.\nSynthesis of B-1.\n        Flame dry the 10 mL 2-neck round bottom flask with the stirring bar.\n      \n        Add a mixture of B-C, malononitrile, and pyridine in the flame-dried\n        round bottom flask.\n        table:files/protocols_protocol_2811_3.csv\n        Stir the reaction and connect one of the necks to the reflux condenser.\n        Heat up the reaction at 70°C for 16 h under argon atmosphere.\n      \nFollow the work up protocol above (Step 5. d-f).\n        Purify the reaction mixture by silica column chromatography. If\n        EtOAc/Hex (1:4, v/v) is used as eluent, the purple\n        substance corresponding to Rf 0.2 on TLC is the product.\n      \n        Dry the solvent and confirm using NMR and Mass spectroscopy.\n        \nPause point: The synthetic step",
    "can be paused after each step (5–7). Evaporate the solvent from the\n          purified compound and store it at -20°C.\n        \nDetection of E. amylovora in the laboratory\nTiming: <10 min\n    \n      In the experimental setting, E. amylovora can be detected using a\n      spectrofluorometer. When diagnosing the fire blight with the fluorescence\n      spectrum, even minute differences can be identified that are difficult to\n      detect with the naked eye.\n    \n        Rinse the samples with DI H2O. The volume may differ by the\n        size of samples but is recommended fewer for distinct detection.\n      \nAdd 10 mM of B-1 stock up to 10 μM into the rinsed solution.\n        Measure the fluorescence spectrum using a spectrofluorometer (RF-6000,\n        Shimadzu) at an excitation and emission wavelength of 551/686 nm (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2811-Fig3.jpg\n              Figure 3.

To detect the extremely low\n      concentration of E. amylovora (102 CFU/mL), use a\n      concentration of B-1 less than 10 μM. Although the fluorescent intensity\n      of B-1 is extremely low, it may interfere with the interpretation of\n      fluorescence change by E. amylovora.\n    \nDetection of E. amylovora by spraying B-1\nTiming: <10 min\n    \n      The following protocol describes how to detect E. amylovora on the\n      surface of plants or objects by spraying the fluorescent probe (B-1). The\n      spraying method can be generally applied to any sample materials for\n      detecting E. amylovora.\n    \nDilute B-1 with DI H2O to produce a 100 μM solution.\nSpray the B-1 solution 2–3 times over the samples.",
