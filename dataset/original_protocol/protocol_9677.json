  "procedures": [
    "The protocol is based on the isolation of IFP-MSCs from goats. Goat IFP and blood were collected from a local abattoir. Since such tissue collections are outside the purview of an Institutional Animal Ethics Committee, ethical approval was not required.\n1. Isolation of IFP-MSCs from the femorotibial joint of goat knee\nCollect goat femorotibial joint (sample) encompassing ~15 cm each of the femoral and tibial regions of the hind limbs. Immediately place the sample in a sterilized sample collection box and store it at 4 °C for transportation to the laboratory for further processing. Process the samples aseptically in a biosafety cabinet, using sterilized surgical tools throughout the procedure (Figure 1, Step 1).\nPlace the sample on a 150 mm Petri dish and rinse it thoroughly with autoclaved phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with antibiotics (5 µg/mL amphotericin B, 200 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin, and 50 µg/mL ciprofloxacin) to avoid contamination. Always ensure that the sample is kept hydrated using PBS.\nCarefully examine the anatomical regions of the sample. For ease of access to the joint capsule, ensure that the extra tissues from both the long bones are completely removed (Figure 1, Step 2).\nTo achieve this, first, hold the end surface of the femur bone with one hand and, with sharp scissors, cut longitudinally towards the joint. Remove the surrounding muscles and adipose tissue from the bone during the process. Be careful that the tissue surrounding the immediate joint capsule remains undisturbed initially.\nSimilarly, make another incision at the tibial end of the sample and remove the muscles and adipose tissue from the tibial bone. Ensure that both the long bones are completely exposed and the joint capsule is clearly visible after this step (Figure 1, Step 3).",
    "Next, make an incision from either side of the synovium membrane to cut open the articulating joint (Figure 1, Step 4). Cut free the patella from both the synovium membrane and patellar ligaments using a fresh batch of sterilized scissors and forceps. Immediately keep the separated patella in a Petri dish containing PBS (Figure 1, Step 5).\nRemove the entire fat pad present on the inner surface of the patella using scissors and forceps and collect the fat pad in another fresh Petri dish (Figure 1, Step 6). Mince the collected fat pad using a scalpel. Include other surgical tools (e.g., scissors or surgical blades) as required to obtain the smallest possible fat pieces/segments of ~2-3 mm.\n\tNOTE: Good mincing is critical to result in a good yield of cells. Always keep the tissue hydrated and do not let it dry at any stage of the isolation procedure.\nTransfer the minced tissue using a spatula to a 50 mL centrifuge tube and wash it with PBS supplemented with antibiotics at room temperature (RT) for 15 min in a test tube mixer. Repeat the washing step 3x, 15 min each.\nFor enzymatic digestion, incubate the minced tissue (~5 g) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Media (DMEM low glucose) containing 1.5 mg/mL type II collagenase (20 mL) and supplemented with 2% FBS at 37 °C for 12-16 h.\n\tNOTE: Perform the digestion in a test tube mixer at ~15 rotations per minute (RPM).\nCarefully aspirate the digested tissue and filter it through a cell strainer (70 µm) to remove any undigested tissue. Centrifuge the filtrate in a 15 mL centrifuge tube at 150 x g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and wash the pellet with DMEM low glucose at least 2x.",
    "NOTE: Pour the digested tissue slowly into the strainer to avoid spillage. Use a low volume centrifuge tube (15 mL) to get a good pellet.\nResuspend the obtained cell pellet in complete DMEM media (DMEM low glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics [2.5 µg/mL amphotericin, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin, and 25 µg/mL ciprofloxacin]), referred to as expansion media in the protocol in the subsequent steps.\nSeed the cells on 150 mm Petri dishes and culture them in the expansion media supplemented with 5 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and 50 µg/mL 2-Phospho-L-ascorbic acid trisodium salt. Incubate the cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator to allow the cells to adhere and proliferate. Monitor the attachment and growth of the cells on a daily basis.\n2. Maintenance and expansion of isolated cells\nChange the media every 3 days until the cells become confluent. Add fresh 5 ng/mL bFGF and 50 µg/mL 2-Phospho-L-ascorbic acid trisodium salt directly to the Petri dish every time the media is changed. After the cells become 80%-90% confluent, subculture the cells.\n\tNOTE: Remove the non-adherent entities during each media change. In case oil droplets are seen after 3 days of incubation, wash the cells with PBS 1x and then add fresh media to the Petri dish. Continue with PBS wash before each media change until the oil droplets are completely removed.\nSub-culturing of cells: Remove the expansion media from the Petri dish and wash the cells 1x with PBS. Add 4 mL of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA to the dish and incubate the cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 4 min.\n\tNOTE: Confluency (80%-90%) is achieved within 7 days. Uniformly distribute the trypsin/EDTA solution over the entire surface of the Petri dish during trypsinization.",
    "Dislodge the cells by tapping the plate on the side and observing under a microscope to confirm that all the cells are detached. Neutralize the trypsin after adding an equal volume (4 mL) of expansion media.\nCollect the dissociated cells using a pipette in a fresh 15 mL polypropylene tube and centrifuge at 150 x g for 5 min at RT. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in the desired volume of expansion media.\nCount the cells using the standard cell counting method and subculture in 150 mm Petri dishes at a seeding density of 1 x 104 cells/cm2 for further expansion. For all assays, use a confluent monolayer of cells of passage number P2-P5.\n\t​NOTE: Cryopreserve the excess cells.\n3. Evaluation of the clonogenic ability of IFP-MSCs using colony forming assay (CFU-F)\nFor CFU-F assay, seed the cells in expansion media in a 6-well tissue culture plate at a seeding density of 50-100 cells/cm2. Add media to obtain a final volume of 3 mL.\n\tNOTE: Optimize the cell concentration for assays and treatment.\nCulture the cells for 12 days at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator under standard culture conditions to allow the cells to form colonies. Change the media every 3 days. Be gentle while changing the media.\nAfter 12 days, rinse the colonies 1x with PBS and fix them using 20% methanol for 20 min at RT. Stain the colonies with crystal violet dye (0.5% [w/v] in 20% methanol) for 20 min at RT. Count the individual colonies using an inverted microscope.\n\t​NOTE: A colony is defined as a cluster of more than 50 cells.\n4. Differentiation potential of IFP-MSCs\nInducing adipogenic differentiation of IFP-MSCs",
    "To induce adipogenesis, seed the cells at a density of 25 x 103 cells/cm2 in a 24-well tissue culture plate. Add media to obtain a final volume of 500 µL. Culture the cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.\nOne day post-confluency, replace the expansion medium with 500 µL of adipogenic differentiation media. It requires approximately 2 days for the cells to reach confluency.\nPrepare the adipogenic differentiation media by supplementing expansion media (DMEM + 10% FBS + 2.5 µg/mL amphotericin, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin, and 25 µg/mL ciprofloxacin) with 25 mM D (+)-glucose, 10 µg/mL insulin, 1 µM dexamethasone, and 100 µM indomethacin.\n\t\tNOTE: Differentiation media is unstable at 4 °C after 1 month; hence, prepare the media as and when required.\nConsider the cells cultured in the expansion media supplemented with 25 mM D (+) glucose as uninduced controls. Change the media every 3 days for 14 days. At the end of the 14 days, wash the cells 1x with PBS. Fix the cells using neutral buffered formalin (NBF; 4 % formaldehyde in PBS) for 15 min at 4 °C.\nFollowing fixation, wash the wells 1x with distilled water and then incubate the cells with 60% isopropanol for 5 min at RT. After removing isopropanol, stain the lipid droplets by incubating the cells with 500 µL of the working solution of Oil Red O dye for 5 min at RT. Wash the wells 1x with distilled water to remove the unbound dye and image the cells using an inverted microscope.",
    "NOTE: Prepare the stock solution of Oil Red O (ORO) by dissolving 300 mg of ORO in 100 mL of 99% isopropanol. To prepare the working solution, mix three parts of stock ORO and two parts of distilled water and allow it to mix at RT for 10 min. Filter the mixture using 0.2 µm filter paper. The working solution is ready to use. The stock solution can be prepared and stored at RT for 1 month in the dark, whereas the working solution needs to be freshly prepared prior to each use/staining.\nInducing chondrogenic differentiation of IFP MSCs\n\t\nIsolation of goat plasma:\n\t\t\nPrepare 3.4% (w/v) sodium-citrate in distilled water. Add 5 mL of the prepared sodium citrate solution to a 50 mL centrifuge tube.\nCollect 45 mL of the freshly isolated goat blood in the same tube. Immediately tilt the tube to mix the blood with sodium citrate thoroughly to prevent clotting and transport it to the laboratory at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge the collected goat blood at 1000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant (plasma) to a fresh tube inside a biosafety cabinet. Filter the plasma through 0.2 µm filters, aliquot, and store at -20 °C for further use.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Maintain the temperature of 2-8 °C while handling the samples. It is important to minimize the freeze-thaw cycles of plasma.\nCulture the expanded cells to 80%-90% confluency, dissociate the cells using trypsin/EDTA solution, and pellet down the cells at 150 x g for 5 min in a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Resuspend the pellet in goat plasma at a density of 2 x 106 cells per 50 µL of plasma solution.",
    "Add a drop of plasma-containing cells (50 µL) onto a sterilized 90 mm Petri dish and then add calcium chloride at a final concentration of 0.3% (w/v). Mix well to fabricate cross-linked plasma hydrogel.\nIncubate the fabricated hydrogel at 37 °C for 40 min. After incubation, transfer the hydrogels to 24-well tissue culture plates containing chondrogenic media.\nPrepare chondrogenic media by supplementing DMEM low glucose with 10 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 1.25 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 mM proline, 50 µg/mL 2-Phospho-L-ascorbic acid trisodium salt, 100 nM dexamethasone, 1x insulin, transferrin, sodium selenite + linoleic-BSA (ITS+1), antibiotics (2.5 µg/mL amphotericin, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin and 25 µg/mL ciprofloxacin), and 10 ng/mL transforming growth factor- β1 (TGF-β1).\nThe hydrogels cultured in complete DMEM media (DMEM low glucose with 10% FBS and antibiotics [2.5 µg/mL amphotericin, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin, and 25 µg/mL ciprofloxacin]) without TGF-β1 are considered as uninduced controls. Change the media every 3 days for 14 days.\nAfter 14 days of chondrogenic differentiation of cells in plasma hydrogels, wash the hydrogels with PBS 3x for 5 min each and then fix the samples in NBF for 3 h.\n\t\tCAUTION: Formaldehyde is a potential carcinogen and can cause irritation to the nose, throat, and lungs upon inhalation. Perform all procedures related to formaldehyde in a fume hood.\nRemove NBF, wash the hydrogels with PBS 3x for 5 min each, and then incubate in 35% (w/v) sucrose at RT overnight to allow the solution to be completely absorbed into the samples. Acclimatize the hydrogels in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound for 3 h. Embed the samples in OCT compound using silicone molds under liquid nitrogen.",
    "Cut the samples at a thickness of 10-12 µm on gelatin-coated glass slides using a cryotome and store them at -20 °C for future use. To examine the presence or deposition of the extracellular matrix after chondrogenic differentiation, stain the sections with Alcian Blue and Safranin-O dye, which bind to sulfated glycosaminoglycans.\n\t\tNOTE: To prepare Alcian Blue dye, dissolve 1 g of Alcian Blue dye in 100 mL of 0.1 N HCl and mix thoroughly in a test tube mixer overnight. The solution can be stored at RT for 1 month in the dark. To prepare Safranin-O dye, dissolve 0.1 g of Safranin-O dye in 100 mL of distilled water and mix thoroughly in a test tube mixer overnight.\nFor Alcian Blue staining, wash the hydrogel sections 1x with distilled water for 5 min. To fix the sections, add 4% NBF to the slides and incubate for 30 min.\nWash the sections 1x with distilled water for 5 min and then 2x with 0.1 N HCl for 30 s each. Remove the HCl and gently dry the slides with tissue paper. Add the prepared Alcian Blue stain to the sections and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber.\nWash the unbound dye with 0.1 N HCl and then distilled water for 3 min. Dehydrate the sections in absolute ethanol, clear them in xylene, and finally mount the stained sections in a resinous medium for imaging.\nFor Safranin-O staining, wash the hydrogel sections with distilled water 1x for 5 min. To fix the sections, add 4% NBF to the slides and incubate for 30 min. Wash the sections 1x with distilled water for 5 min, and then dip the slides in 1% acetic acid for 10-15 s. Dry the slides gently with tissue paper.",
    "Add prepared Safranin-O dye to the sections and incubate for 10 min at RT. Wash the unbound dye with 100% ethanol. Dip the slides in 100% ethanol for 5 min. Air-dry the slides, clear them in xylene, and finally mount the stained sections in a resinous medium for imaging.\nInducing osteogenic differentiation of IFP MSCs\n\t\nTo induce osteogenic differentiation, trypsinize the cells, as stated before (Step 2.2.). Seed the cells at a density of 3 x 103 cells/cm2 in a 24-well tissue culture plate. Add media to obtain a final volume of 500 µL. Culture the cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. 1 day post-seeding, replace the expansion media with 500 µL osteogenic differentiation media.\nPrepare the osteogenic media by supplementing expansion media (DMEM + 10% FBS +2.5 µg/mL amphotericin, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin, and 25 µg/mL ciprofloxacin) with 25 mM D (+)-glucose, 10 nM dexamethasone, 10 mM β-glycerophosphate, 50 µg/mL 2-Phospho-L-ascorbic acid trisodium salt, and 10 nM vitamin D3.\n\t\tNOTE: The cells cultured in expansion media supplemented with 25 mM D (+) glucose are considered uninduced controls.\nChange the osteogenic media every 3 days for 14 days or 28 days. At the end of 14 days, measure the extent of osteogenesis by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining.",
    "NOTE: To prepare the substrate for ALP staining, dissolve one 5-Bromo-4- Chloro-3-Indolyl Phosphate (BCIP)/Nitroblue Tetrazolium (NBT) tablet in 10 mL of distilled water in a 15 mL centrifuge tube. Let the tablet dissolve completely. The substrate solution is ready to use. Since the substrate solution cannot be stored for a longer duration, based on need, break the tablet in half and dissolve it in 5 mL of distilled water. To prepare the permeabilization buffer, add Tris buffer (100 mM) and magnesium chloride (5 mM) to distilled water. Add Triton X100 (0.1%) to the solution and let it dissolve. Adjust the pH of the solution to 9.25-9.75.\nFor ALP staining, after 14 days of induction, remove the media and wash the cells with PBS. Fix the cells using NBF (4%) for 1 min. Wash the cells with PBS and permeate using the prepared lysis buffer for 2-3 min.\nAdd 500 µL of the prepared substrate solution to the cells and let it incubate for 15 min to 1 h, depending upon the expression level. Check the development of purple/blue color in between.\nRemove the substrate solution and wash with distilled water. Image the stained cells using an inverted microscope.\nAt the end of 28 days, measure the extent of calcification after osteogenic induction by Alizarin Red-S staining.\n\t\tNOTE: To prepare the Alizarin Red-S staining solution (40 mM), dissolve 2 g of Alizarin Red-S in 100 mL of distilled water and adjust the pH to 4.1-4.3 with HCl or NH4OH. Filter the solution through a 0.22 µm membrane and store at 4 °C in the dark. The pH of the solution is important; hence it is recommended either to make a fresh solution or to re-measure the pH of the solution if it is more than 1 month old.",
    "For Alizarin Red-S staining, after 28 days of induction, remove the media and wash the cells 1x with cold PBS. Fix the cells using 70% ethanol for 1 h at 4 °C.\nRemove the fixative and wash the cells 2x with distilled water. Remove the water completely and add 1 mL of Alizarin Red-S solution to each well.\nIncubate the cells with the solution for 1 h at RT and image the cells using an inverted microscope.\nSubscription Required.
