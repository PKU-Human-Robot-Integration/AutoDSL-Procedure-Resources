    "1. Preparation of oil-lipid-mixture\nNOTE: The step needs to be performed in a fume hood following all the safety guidelines for handling chloroform.\nTake 0.5 mL of chloroform in a 15 mL glass vial. Add 88 µL of 25 mg/mL dioleoyl-phosphocholine (DOPC), 9.3 µL of 50 mg/mL cholesterol, and 5 µL of 1 mg/mL dioleoyl-phosphoethanolamine-lissamine rhodamine B (rhodamine PE) (see Table of Materials) into the 15 ml glass vial.\n\tNOTE: The final mole fractions of DOPC and cholesterol in silicone oil/mineral oil are 69.9% and 30%, respectively. It was established that 20-30 mol% cholesterol is an optimized concentration for membrane fluidity and stability of GUVs generated using the presented technique25,26. Physiologically, these values are well within the cholesterol concentration range found in mammalian cell plasma membranes6. Lipid stocks are acquired as solutions in chloroform and stored at -20 °C. Lipid stock vials should be acclimated to room temperature before they are opened.\nPipette 7.2 mL of silicone oil and 1.8 mL of mineral oil in a second 15 mL vial (see Table of Materials). Generally, this needs to be done in a low-humidity glove box, mainly if the mineral oil is reused.\nMix the oils by vortexing at the maximum rotational speed (3200 rpm) for 10 s, add the mixture to the vial containing the lipid-in-chloroform mixture and immediately place it on the vortex mixer. Vortex for 10-15 s at the maximum rotational speed (3200 rpm). The resulting lipids-in-oil mix should be slightly cloudy, as the lipids are not fully dissolved in the oil but rather dispersed as small aggregates24.",
    "Put the lipid-in-oil dispersion in a bath sonicator (see Table of Materials) with ultrasonic power of 80 W and operating frequency of 40 kHz at room temperature for 30 min. Use the mixture immediately or store at 4 °C for a maximum of 24 h.\n2. Vesicle generation\nMount the 3D-printed shaft (Supplementary File 1) made from black resin (see Table of Materials) on the benchtop stir plate and set rotational speed to 1200 rpm.\nMount the 3D-printed cDICE chamber (Supplementary File 2) made from clear resin (see Table of Materials) on the shaft (Figure 1A,B).\nPrepare actin and actin-binding proteins (ABP) solutions separately in a total volume of 20 µL.\n\t\nPrepare 1-10 µM of actin in globular actin buffer (G-buffer), including 10% ATTO 488 actin (see Table of Materials).\n\t\tNOTE: 1x G-buffer comprises 5 mM of Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.2 mM of CaCl2.\nAdd filamentous actin polymerization buffer (F-buffer) to begin actin polymerization on ice. Keep the solutions on ice to slow down actin polymerization before the addition of a crosslinker.\n\t\tNOTE: The 1x F-buffer contains 50 mM of KCl, 2 mM of MgCl2, and 3 mM of ATP in 10 mM of Tris, pH 7.5.\nWait for 15 min to allow for initiation of actin polymerization on ice before adding crosslinkers of interest at the desired molar ratio. Keep the solution on ice until encapsulation.\nPrepare actin-binding proteins (ABPs) separately in a microtube (Figure 1C).",
    "NOTE: This step is performed when a combination of ABPs (e.g., myosin, α-actinin, fascin, Arp2/3 complex) encapsulates with actin25,26,27. In such cases, the desired amount of each ABP is drawn from its stock and added into the microtube designated for ABPs. As the total solution is to be 20 µL, stock aliquots of ABPs must be prepared so that the desired amount of the total ABP mixture does not exceed 5-6 µL. The only ABP used in the representative results here is fascin, the preparation of which is mentioned below.\n\t\t\nAliquot 1.57 µL of fascin from a 1.75 mg/mL of fascin stock (see Table of Materials), and directly add to the actin solution in step 2.7. This corresponds to 2.5 µM of fascin in the solution.\nAdd 7.5% of density gradient medium (see Table of Materials) into the actin solution to create a density gradient between the outer and the inner aqueous phase to facilitate GUV sedimentation.\nDispense 700 µL of the outer solution of 200 mM of glucose into the chamber (Figure 1D, left).\n\tNOTE: The osmolarity of the inner solution determines the concentration of glucose. For these experiments, the osmolarity of the inner solution is ~200 mOsm, so a 200 mM glucose solution is used as the outer solution.\nAdd a sufficient amount of lipid-oil mixture (>3 mL based on the chamber size) into the chamber until 60%-80% of the chamber is filled (Figure 1D, right). An interface will be formed between the lipid-oil mixture and the outer solution.",
    "Transfer ABPs (prepared in step 2.3.4) into the actin solution. Using a regular 100-1000 µL pipette, immediately transfer the 700 µL of the lipid-oil mixture into the actin-ABP mixture (Figure 1E, left). Pipette up and down 8 times to generate cell-sized lipid-monolayer droplets with diameter in the range of 7-100 µm (Figure 1E, middle).\n\tNOTE: Step 2.7 needs to be completed in a few seconds to avoid any actin network assembly before encapsulation. Thus, before performing the step, ensure that pipette tips are already inserted into the pipettes and ready to transfer the mixtures.\nUsing the same 100-1000 µL pipette, immediately dispense the entire emulsion into the rotating chamber. Droplets will acquire a second leaflet of lipids by crossing the lipid monolayer at the oil-outer solution interface, thereby forming GUVs (Figure 1E, right).\nRemove the chamber from the stir plate and discard most of the lipid-oil mixture by tilting the chamber in the waste container so that a large portion of the lipid-oil mixture is drained from the large opening at the center of the chamber.\n\tNOTE: This way, the lipid-oil mixture is drawn off the chamber, avoiding mixing of lipid-oil mixture with the outer solution in the next step.\nHold the chamber with its lid facing towards the user. Open the chamber lid and slightly tilt the chamber towards the user. The interface between the outer solution containing GUVs and the lipid-oil mixture is visible from the chamber opening (where the lid is located).\nUsing a pipette, collect enough outer solution containing GUVs and dispense 50-300 µL of the outer solution into a 96-well plate to obtain an appropriate density of GUVs.",
    "NOTE: Following this protocol, a total of about 2 x 105 GUVs are released in the outer solution inside the chamber. The GUV dispersity was not quantified; however, the diameter of about 90% of GUVs is in the range of 12-30 µm. GUVs with any diameter in the range of 7-50 µm can be found in the population. Depending on the encapsulated density gradient medium, GUV size, and solution depth in the well plate, it takes 2-15 min for GUVs to settle down on the surface. The yield of GUVs with reconstituted actin bundles is about 90%.\n3. Imaging and 3D image reconstruction\nSet up the 96 well plate on the stage of an inverted microscope equipped with a spinning disk (or laser scanning) confocal unit, an EMCCD or an sCMOS camera, and an oil immersion 60x objective lens (see Table of Materials).\nFocus on any region of interest (ROI) and take a z-stack image sequence from the ROI with a z-step interval of 0.5 µm.\n\tNOTE: Because GUVs can be slightly displaced on the surface over time, it is recommended to capture a multi-wavelength set of images at each z-plane if multiple fluorophores are being imaged, i.e., take a group of 561 nm and 488 nm images at each z-lane at a time to capture ATTO 488 actin and Rhod PE images.\nSave each z-stack image sequence in .tiff format.\nOpen an image sequence of interest in an image processing software (ImageJ/Fiji). Identify the image with the highest intensity. Hold \"ctrl+shift+c\" to open the Brightness & Contrast window and click on Reset.\nFrom the ImageJ/Fiji menu, go to Analyze > Set Scale and enter the known physical distance and its unit for each image pixel.",
    "From the ImageJ/Fiji menu, go to Image > Stacks > 3D project to reconstruct a 3D image from the z-stack. Set \"Projection method\" as Brightness Point, \"Slice Spacing (µm)\" as 0.5, and checkmark Interpolate. The default options can be used for the rest of the settings.\n\tNOTE: z-intervals in some microscopes might not be calibrated, and the actual movement in z-direction might slightly differ from the entered z-interval (i.e., 0.5 µm). In such cases, a 3D calibration specimen such as fluorescent microspheres with a known diameter can be used to obtain the actual z-interval. This value will thus be used as \"Slice Spacing (µm)\" for 3D projection.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
