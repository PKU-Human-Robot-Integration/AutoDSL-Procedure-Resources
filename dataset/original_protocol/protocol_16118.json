    "This protocol describes designing sgRNAs for your chosen target sequence (see Strategic Planning for detailed background information). It is recommended that the design should include four sgRNAs for each gene target, two guides per construct, and two constructs per target gene. Ideally, paired guides are designed 50 to 150 bp apart, which will give an easily recognizable deletion if the guides work simultaneously.\nMaterials\nComputer with alignment software and Internet access to the following websites:\n         \nhttp://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum[href=http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum]\nhttps://crispr.bioinfo.nrc.ca/WheatCrispr/[href=https://crispr.bioinfo.nrc.ca/WheatCrispr/]\nhttps://grassroots.tools/public/service/blast-blastn[href=https://grassroots.tools/public/service/blast-blastn]\n1. The International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) genomic information for wheat cultivar “Chinese Spring” is available at http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum[href=http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum]. Collate information for your target gene of interest. Ensure that you can identify exonic and intronic sequences and the start of translation (ATG).\n2. Align the three homoeologs of your gene of interest from the three subgenomes. Look for areas of homology where guides can be designed to target all homoeologs.\nIf possible, it is easier and quicker to work with ∼500 bp of sequence consisting of the 5′ UTR, first exon, and first intron but this is dependent on the target gene sequence.\n3. Either paste the sequence into WheatCrispr or Enter an IWGSC v1 gene name such as: TraesCS6B02G093900homologous sequence. Select to target promoter or coding region. Tick the “Target Homoeologues?” box if all three subgenome homoeologs are to be targeted. Run the program to identify 20-nt sgRNA guide sequences within the target gene sequence. When using SpCas9, the target site of the sgRNA will be the 20-bp preceding a PAM (5′-NGG-3′). The WheatCrispr website will display an overall score consisting of a weighted average of the on-target and off-target scores (https://crispr.bioinfo.nrc.ca/WheatCrispr/[href=https://crispr.bioinfo.nrc.ca/WheatCrispr/]).",
    "The on-target score predicts the cutting efficiency of the guide RNA (gRNA) and ranges from 0 (no predicted activity) to 1.0 (maximum activity). The off-target score ranges from 0 (no predicted activity) to 1.0 (full activity, which would have equal activity to the on-target site). The overall score is a weighted average of these two scores and WheatCrispr will display the top ten predicted sgRNAs.\n4. Ensure that the chosen sgRNA guides will target the desired gene target in the wheat cultivar “Fielder” by carrying out BLASTn analysis. Add the target sequence to https://grassroots.tools/public/service/blast-blastn[href=https://grassroots.tools/public/service/blast-blastn] and check that the sgRNA sequence does not differ between CP and “Fielder.”\n5. Design sets of primers for amplification of the target area of each subgenome individually, to be able to directly Sanger sequence the amplicons (see Strategic Planning, Screening section).\n6. Order complementary oligonucleotides with the sgRNA sequence with the addition of 4 nt at the 5′ end for construct assembly (Fig. 1A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.65#cpz165-fig-0001]).\nDetails of construct assembly follow in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.65#cpz165-prot-0002].\nThe sgRNA's sequence should be checked before ordering oligonucleotides to ensure they do not contain BsaI or BpiI enzyme recognition sequences.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6ae0f577-bb3d-4aa2-9c5e-bd292adc00df/cpz165-fig-0001-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 1\nSchematic of Golden Gate level 1 diglig reaction components.

(B) The two level 1 diglig reactions are depicted: sgRNA1 (level 0) will be inserted into the level 1 TaU6 acceptor (L1P3) and sgRNA2 (level 0) will be inserted into the level 1 TaU6 acceptor (L1P4) replacing the LacZ marker genes which are flanked by BsaI sites.",
    "This basic protocol describes how to assemble plasmid vectors for CRISPR-Cas9 induced targeted gene knockout using the Type IIS restriction enzyme mediated Golden Gate (GG) modular cloning (MoClo) assembly (Weber, Engler, Gruetzner, Werner, & Marillonnet, 2011[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.65#cpz165-bib-0029]). The GG based MoClo system is a hierarchical cloning system that uses standardized DNA parts and/or overhangs; e.g., promoters, coding sequences, or terminators (Level 0), which are assembled into expression cassettes (Level 1) and these in turn can be assembled into multigene binary vector constructs (Level 2). The assembly is performed in a “one-pot” digestion-ligation reaction, where multiple DNA fragments are combined in a defined linear order into a recipient vector. The defined linear order of the level 1 expression cassettes within the multigene level 2 binary vector run from the left border (LB in Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.65#cpz165-fig-0002]) repeat denoted as Position 1 (P1) to Position 7 (P7) at the right border (RB) repeat. The finished binary vector containing two guides will have the plant selection resistance gene hpt at P1, Cas9 P2, and TaU6-sgRNAs at Positions P3 and P4 (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.65#cpz165-fig-0002]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d7d84b6b-d949-4c91-931d-c4d3ccbaf0d7/cpz165-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nSchematic of Golden Gate Level 2 diglig reaction. Level 1 components pictured from Position 1 to Position 4 and linker which will be cloned in a defined order into the pGGG-M L2 acceptor replacing the LacZ marker gene it contains. Four bp overhangs created by BpiI are depicted in bold text. The final Level 2 binary vector (pGGG L2 CRISPR) containing two guides will have the plant selection resistance gene hpt at P1, Cas9 P2, and TaU6-sgRNAs at Positions P3 and P4.",
    "The first procedure is to introduce your chosen target sequence into the sgRNA invariant scaffold downstream of the TaU6 promoter; this is a simple and rapid single cloning step. The complementary oligonucleotide pair (level 0 component) encoding the 20-nt guide sequences with the addition of four base overhangs at the 5′ ends are annealed and ligated into a level 1 acceptor plasmid directly between the TaU6 promoter and the sgRNA scaffolding site (Fig. 1B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.65#cpz165-fig-0001]). Once the level 1 plasmids containing your sgRNAs are prepared, these can then be incorporated into your final level 2 binary vector along with the selection cassette and Cas9.\nMaterials\nsgRNA oligonucleotides, sense and complement, resuspended at 100 µM\nLevel 1 P1 OsActinP:hpt-int:35sT plasmid at ∼80 ng µl-1 (∼50-100 ng µl-1; Addgene, #165423)\nLevel 1 P2 OsUbiP:Cas9:NosT plasmid at ∼80 ng µl-1 (∼50-100 ng µl-1; Addgene, #165424)\nLevel 1 P3 TaU6 acceptor plasmid at ∼80 ng µl-1 (∼50-100 ng µl-1; Addgene, #165599)\nLevel 1 P4 TaU6 acceptor plasmid at ∼80 ng µl-1 (∼50-100 ng µl-1; Addgene, #165600)\nLevel 1 end-linker 4 plasmid pELE-4 at ∼80 ng µl-1 (∼50-100 ng µl-1; Addgene, #48019)\nLevel 2 acceptor plasmid pGGG-M at ∼80 ng µl-1 (∼50-100 ng µl-1; Addgene, #165422)\nRestriction enzyme Eco31I (BsaI), 10 U µl-1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

    "This protocol describes the screening of primary transgenic plants for genome editing events using direct Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons (see Strategic Planning for detailed background information). For screening hexaploid wheat using Sanger sequencing, PCR amplicons need to be identified that span the gene target (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.65#cpz165-fig-0004]) within each subgenome (A, B, and D). When screening primary transgenics for genome editing events using direct Sanger sequencing of amplicons, due to the usual mosaic nature of editing, expect to see mixtures of unedited and edited DNA within samples. Identification of editing is done by looking at the sequence chromatogram traces. The chromatogram trace should be of good quality with well-defined peaks; active editing is identified by seeing a dramatic drop of signal and double peaks in the trace at an sgRNA target site (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.65#cpz165-fig-0005]). This drop/double peaks will continue to the end of the trace. Screening this way in the primary transgenics allows the identification of wheat lines with active editing. These “active” lines can be taken through to the T1 generation where the edits and transfer DNA (T-DNA) are segregated. For more in-depth analysis of the primary transgenics, the PCR amplicon can be inserted into a cloning vector such as pGEM-T, transformed into E. coli, and a number (around ten, for example) of individual colonies selected, prepped, and sequenced. For a large number of wheat lines this would be a highly impractical way of screening. Next generation sequencing (NGS) can provide more detailed and quantitative information about editing events. NGS generates large amounts of data and requires competence in bioinformatics to handle and analyze such data (Bahassi & Stambrook, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.65#cpz165-bib-0005]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2b71c96f-204c-49cf-9c1c-ed7126c62bf0/cpz165-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4",

All samples should be sequenced to identify smaller indels.\n3. Send samples to be directly sequenced using the forward SgS primer.\nAnalysis of sequence data\nOn receiving your sequence data from the sequencing company, check the quality and length of reads; this information is usually provided by the company. Do not dismiss short good quality reads as these may indicate a larger deletion.\n4.
