    "All procedure described have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of Southern California.\n1. Animal Handling and Habituation\nIntroduction\n\t\nAllow mice to acclimate to the husbandry conditions and handling technique of the experiment to decrease stress during the ensuing drug administration procedures. During this time, record the body weight and food intake of each mouse; if desired, they can later be used as a non-invasive point of comparison to assess drug toxicity (optional). The former can also be used to determine weight-based drug dosing.\n\t\tNote: Anecdotally, the length of the habituation period should be determined based on the number of experimenters interacting with the animal. In our experience, mice of the C57BL/6J strain have been observed to have trouble habituating to handling by more than ~5 people within our typical week-long habituation period. If feasible, experimenter(s) are also encouraged to refrain from using scented lotions, soaps, and perfumes before handling the animals as previous reports indicate novel stimuli, such as smells, may hinder the habituation period11.\nSteps\n\t\nBeginning at least 5 days prior to the initiation of the study, transfer the animals to the room in which the subsequent experiments will occur.\nRecord the weight of the mouse by firmly grasping the middle of the tail and gently lifting the animal out of the cage and into the weight boat.\n\t\t\nPlace the mouse on the scale as soon as it is lifted out of the cagekeeping in mind to properly grasp the medial/proximal aspect of the tail, as to avoid degloving injuries, which can occur when grasping the distal aspect of the tail12 .\nRecord the weight value once the mouse has been safely placed into the weigh boat.",
    "Record the weight of the food for a recommended 2 consecutive days, in order to establish baseline food consumption levels that will help capture potential toxicities during the experiment13.\n2. Preparation of Feeding Needle, Sucrose Solution, and Individual ODS\nUse an autoclave to sterilize the stainless steel gavage needles in preparation for the experiment. Prepare 2 needles/group and 1 additional needle to be used as a back-up if need be.\n\tNote: This study utilized a 1.5 inches, curved, 18 G, stainless steel feeding needle with a 2.25 mm ball at the end of the needle.\nAdd 20 ml of water to 0.85 g of sucrose to create a 4.25% (w/v) sucrose solution.\n\tNote: Depending on the parameters under assessment other low doses of sucrose could potentially also be used14.\nPrepare the oral dissolving strip (ODS) for each animal by cutting the standard rectangular test strip into a piece that is 0.5 cm inches in diameter using a commercially available single quarter inch hole-puncher. The rectangular test strip used in this demonstration was formulated to contain 6 mg of ivermectin (IVM), and when cut to this size, allocates a 0.21 mg dosage to each individual circular piece approximating a 10 mg/kg dose for each animal (our desired dose/animal). This dose can be adjusted by concentrating/diluting the overall formulation on the rectangular strip and/or cutting the strip into different size.\n3. Drug â€“ Delivery\nRecord the weight values as previously described in steps 1.1-1.2.\nAfter recording the weight, move the mouse to the metal grid cage top. Once there, using the dominant thumb, index finger, and 3rd finger, gently pull back on the tail. This will cause the mouse to inadvertently grip the wire cage top and stretch out its back, stretching its body away from the experimenter.",
    "Grasp the scruff of the neck with the non-dominant thumb, index finger, and 3rd finger to comfortably restrain the animal with a grip that is secure.\n\tNote: An experimenter with a smaller hand can also use the 4th finger, of the same hand, to pull back the scruff of the back and obtain a more secure hold of the mouse. Additionally, depending on individual preference, ring finger, and/or pinky finger may also be used to secure the tail however this is not necessary12.\nHold the mouse in an upright position.\nCaution: Observe the color of the mucosal membranes of the mouse. A purple/blue appearance is an indication that the experimenter is cinching the scruff too tightly and the mouse cannot breathe.\n\t\nIf this occurs, immediately put the mouse back down on the metal cage top and allow it to rest for ~2-3 min before reattempting to restrain the animal.\nSubmerge the bulb tip of the gavage needle in 4.25% sucrose solution to serve as a tastant adhesive to the ODS.\nPress down on a pre-cut ODS with the bulb tip of the gavage needle to attach the orally dissolving strip.\nPresent the ODS to the mouse by placing it near the nostrils and/or mouth, and allow the animal to consume the film. Alternatively the ODS can be delivered topically to the oral cavity by placing the thin strip directly onto the tongue for the mice to swallow.\nReplace the needle mid-group during the drug-dosing session to prevent the spread of infection.\nSubscription Required.
