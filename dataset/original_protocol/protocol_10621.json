    "1. Fabrication of Master Mold Using Photolithography\nThe ECM protein nanofibers, nanofabrics and nanostructures to be fabricated are first designed using Computer Aided Design (CAD) software. This CAD file is then transferred to a photomask. The type of photomask will depend on the resolution of the features; with a transparency-based photomask adequate for feature sizes down to ~10 μm. Smaller features <10 μm will require a chrome on glass photomask. All of the nanofibers and nanostructures presented here were fabricated using a transparency-based photomask, and thus were nanometer-scale in thickness but not lateral dimensions.\n\tNote: It is important to distinguish which regions of the photomask will be dark (prevent UV light to pass through) and which will be transparent (allow UV light to pass through) as this, along with the type of photoresist (positive or negative), will dictate the final topography of the master mold.\nTo begin fabrication of the master mold, dehydrate a 4\" silicon wafer by placing it on a hotplate set to 150 °C for 15 min.\nCenter the wafer on the vacuum chuck of a spin-coater. Pour SU8-2015 negative photoresist onto the middle of the wafer and continue pouring in concentric circles until about two thirds of the wafer is covered.\n\tNote: Keep the bottle of SU8 close to the wafer when pouring to minimize the formation of bubbles.\nProgram the spincoater as follows:\n\t\nSpread cycle: 500 rpm with an acceleration of 100 rpm/sec for 10 sec.\nSpin cycle: 4,000 rpm with an acceleration of 100 rpm/sec for 30 sec.\n\tNote: This spincoating recipe will form a photoresist layer that is ~10 μm in thickness. By changing the spinning speed or the SU8 formulation, the thickness can be adjusted.\nSoft bake the wafer by placing it on a hotplate set to 95 °C for 3 min.",
    "Expose the wafer with UV light through the photomask for a total dosage of 140 mJ/cm2.\n\tNote: SU8 is a negative photoresist therefore regions where UV light is able to pass through the photomask will remain after developing and become raised features on the master mold.\nPost exposure bake the wafer by placing it on a hotplate set to 95 °C for 4 min.\nDevelop the wafer by placing it in SU8 developer for 3 min. After 3 min, rinse the wafer with isopropyl alcohol. If a white film is produced during the rinsing, the wafer is not fully developed and it should be placed back in the developer for another 30 sec. Rinse again with isopropyl alcohol. Repeat this process until a white film does not form during the isopropyl alcohol rinsing.\nDry the wafer in a stream of nitrogen and place in a 150 mm petri dish to protect from dust.\n2. Making the PDMS Stamps\nPrepare the PDMS prepolymer by combining the elastomer base and curing agent in a 10:1 w/w ratio. Typically 80 g of base and 8 g of curing agent are used to ensure there is sufficient PDMS to cover the master mold in a 1 cm thick layer.\nMix and degas the PDMS using a centripetal mixer set to the following:\n\t\nMix: 2,000 rpm for 2 min\nDegas: 2,000 rpm for 2 min.\nIf a mixer is unavailable mix the PDMS by hand for 10 min using a 10 ml serological pipette. Degas the mixture by placing it in a vacuum desiccator for 30 min to remove bubbles.",
    "Pour enough PDMS prepolymer over the master mold (patterned silicon wafer) to form a 1 cm thick layer. Cure the PDMS by baking at 65 °C for 4 hr or at room temperature for 48 hr.\nOnce cured, The regions containing the patterns can be cut out to form the PDMS stamps. To distinguish the feature side from the backside of the PDMS stamp, cut a notch out of one of the corners on the backside of the stamp.\n3. Microcontact Printing of ECM Patterns\nClean 25 mm diameter glass coverslips by sonication in 95% ethanol for 1 hr and then dry in a 65 °C oven.\nPrepare the PIPAAm solution by dissolving PIPAAm in 1-butanol at a concentration of 10% (w/v, typically 1 g in 10 ml).\nCenter a glass coverslip on the vacuum chuck of the spincoater and pipette 200 μl of the PIPAAm solution so that the entire glass surface is covered.\nSpincoat the coverslip at 6,000 rpm for 1 min.\nClean the PDMS stamps by sonication in 50% ethanol for 30 min and then dry under a stream of nitrogen.\n\tNote: Drying and subsequent steps should be performed in a biosafety cabinet to maintain sterility for applications where the ECM nanostructures will be used with cells.\nCoat the patterned surface of each PDMS stamp with 200 μl of the protein solution, typically 50 μg/ml in sterile distilled water for FN. Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature.\n\tNote: This coating volume is for a 1.5 cm2 PDMS stamp and will need to be adjusted depending on the size of the PDMS stamp, the ECM protein used and the concentration of the ECM protein in solution.\nWash the PDMS stamps in distilled water to remove excess protein and dry thoroughly under a stream of nitrogen.",
    "Note: Any water left on the stamp will trigger the premature dissolution of the PIPAAm coating on the coverslip and prevent proper protein transfer.\nFor sterile fabrication, place the PIPAAm-coated coverslips inside a closed petri dish and sterilize using UV exposure, 45 min under the UV light in a biosafety cabinet is sufficient. If sterility is not required this step can be omitted.\nPerform microcontact printing by placing the feature side of the PDMS stamp in contact with the PIPAAm-coated coverslip. If required, use forceps to tap lightly on the back of the stamps to remove any air bubbles and ensure uniform contact.\nAfter 5 min, peel off the PDMS stamp from the coverslip.\nAt this stage, additional ECM proteins can be patterned to create more complex and multicomponent structures. Up to 3 printings have been verified to work with this process, and more may be feasible.\n4. Release of ECM Nanofibers and Nanostructures\nPlace the patterned PIPAAm coated coverslip in a 35 mm petri dish and inspect the pattern fidelity using phase contrast microscopy. Depending on the pattern, a CCD camera may be necessary to resolve the features of the pattern. Fluorescence microscopy can also be used to inspect the pattern provided the ECM proteins are fluorescently labeled.\nAdd 3 ml of 40 °C distilled water to the petri dish and allow the water to gradually cool.\nThe dissolution of the PIPAAm layer and the release of the ECM protein patterns can be monitored using phase contrast microscopy. If the application does not permit the use of optical techniques, the release can be monitored by measuring the solution temperature. Typically, the water is cooled to room temperature, well below the LCST of PIPAAm (32 °C), to ensure the ECM protein nanostructures have been released.",
    "After release, the nanofibers, nanofabrics and other nanostructures are floating in water. To use them for further applications they need to be manipulated. The exact approach will depend on the experimental objective and may include steps such as immobilizing onto another surface, moving with a micromanipulator system or embedding in a hydrogel.\nSubscription Required.
