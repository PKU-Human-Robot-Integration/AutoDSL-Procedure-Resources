    "Culturing of human skeletal muscle cellsHarvesting of biopsies of m. vastus lateralis from healthy volunteers, satellite cell isolation, and passaging have been described earlier (Lund et al., 2017).Store isolated satellite cells from biopsies in cryo vials at -196°C (1 × 106–2 × 106 cells/vial).Seed myoblasts in 6-well Corning® CELLBIND® plates (passages 3 and 4). Use 2.0 mL of proliferation medium per well and a cell concentration of 50,000 cells per mL, Incubate at 37°C and 5% CO2.At 80–90% confluency (after one week), replace medium with 2.0 mL differentiation medium to facilitate myotube formation. Incubate for 6–7 days.Incubator setupSet up a parallel incubator system with both cooling (18°C) and regular (37°C) conditions in the same incubator. An overview is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4461/bioprotoc-12-13-4461-g001.jpgFigure 1. Setup of in vitro exposure of myotubes in CO2 incubator with parallel exposure of cells to either warm or cold temperature. Thermal block (highlighted with dashed lines, either blue indicating cold exposure or red indicating control conditions of 37°C) temperatures are controlled via connected water circulators (Control = red tubing; cold = blue tubing). Culturing conditions (the actual exposure temperature) are monitored with a thermocouple probe and PicoLog software. Styrofoam insulation is not shown but should be mounted around both tubing and thermos blocks. Figure created in BioRender (biorender.com).Use a regular CO2-incubator with openings for connecting tubes. Set at 37°C and 5% CO2.Set up water circulators holding respective temperatures. The temperature of the cold circulator must be considerably lower than the desired exposure temperature, as the returning water heats up through the incubator. An outline of how to establish the correct temperature is described under section B.2, Method validation.Install two temperature regulated blocks in the incubator.",
    "To ensure sufficient temperature regulation of the thermo block, an aluminum block strung with perfusion tubes of copper (Figure 2) was mounted on the shelves of the incubator. Allow tight connection between surface of the culture wells and the thermo block by milling grooves into the aluminum thermo block (Figure 2A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4461/bioprotoc-12-13-4461-g002.jpgFigure 2. Thermo block. A) Back and front sides of the aluminum thermo block (light blue), strung with serpentine copper tubes (brown) and with grooves milled into it (dark blue), allowing a tight contact to form between the thermo block and the culture plate wells. B) The copper tubing and its dimensions (mm) in the thermo block.Cool or heat the thermo block by perfusion with either cold or hot water from water circulators (outside the incubator). Connect water circulators with thermo block through silicon tubing.Use styrofoam for insulation of thermo block, culture plates, and tubes.Method validationAdd 2.0 mL of medium to each well in three 6-well culture plates. Place the 6-well plates onto the thermo block.Perforate the plate lid and place a thermocouple temperature probe immersed in the well medium of each well.Monitor the temperature in the culture wells.Connect thermocouple temperature probe to a USB TC-08 data logger, and monitor temperature data on a portable PC using the PicoLog software. Verify the temperature needed in the circulators for desired conditions.Measure the culture well temperature every 5th minute for 60 min to establish the required time for temperature stabilization after adjustment of the circulator temperature.Measure the culture well and thermo block temperature every 30 min (time to reach temperature stabilization in our lab). Set water circulator at 8°C with temperature increment of 5°C, resulting in a curve of six measurements.",
    "Adjust the temperature of the water circulator according to the acquired equation, to obtain the desired temperature in the cell medium before exposure of cells.In vitro Cold exposure of cellsIncubate cells established in section A.7 at 18°C well temperature or 37°C (control) for 18 h.Let cells recover at 37°C for 3 h.Harvest cells by careful aspiration of medium followed by (for the purpose of gene expression analysis) addition of 500 µL Isol-RNA Lysis Reagent to each well. If other products than RNA are desired, use a suitable lysis reagent.Detach cells with a cell scraper and shake the plate for 5 min to ensure complete lysis. Transfer the suspension to appropriate tubes and store at -80°C.Continue with RNA isolation according to the procedure recommendations of the lysis manufacturer, or for other preferred downstream analyses.In vivo cold exposure of muscleAnesthesiaAnesthetize the rat by placing it in an anesthetizing box. Close the lid and initiate sedation with Harvard Apparatus Vaporizer with 2.0 L (O2)/min and 5% Isoflurane flow. Monitor to ensure complete sedation, 2–3 min.Place the rat on a table, in supine position. Redirect the anesthesia to an inhalation mask and adjust flow to 0.5 L/min and 3% Isoflurane.Regularly (every 15 min) inspect the absence of withdrawal reflexes to ensure complete sedation during the entire experiment. Reflexes are inspected by pinching the paws with a tweezer.Insert a rectal probe with feedback to a heating pad (Homeothermic blanket control unit), which maintains the core temperature at 36–37°C.Cold exposure of muscleShave the posterior legs of the ratPlace the hind limb on the heating pad, at 37°C. Fixate limbs with surgical tape, with the left hind limb on a cooling plate holding 10°C, as shown in Figure 3. Keep limb on the cooling plate for 1 h.",
    "After thermal exposure, reheat the muscle by placing it on the heating pad for an additional 2 h.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4461/bioprotoc-12-13-4461-g003.jpgFigure 3. Setup of in vivo cold exposure. Isoflurane anesthetized (mask) rat placed in supine position on a heating pad (red), with left hind limb fixed with surgical tape to a cooling plate (blue); the right hind limb serves as a contralateral control. Rectal probe and vaporizer are not shown. Figure created in BioRender (biorender.com).Perform transcardial perfusion by a surgical thoracotomy.Spray the chest and abdomen with 70% ethanol.With a surgical scissor and tweezer, make a 5–7 cm transverse incision through the skin and abdominal wall, at the abdominal center.Make a horizontal incision through the diaphragm to fully identify the heart.Inject 0.1 mL (50 mg) of heparin into the left ventricle.Use a scissor to cut the rib cage laterally on both sides, starting from the lower ribs and up toward the clavicle. Use an artery clamp on the xiphoid processus and tilt the anterior rib cage surface up away from the heart.Perform a small incision in the pericardium to uncover the heart muscleMake a small incision on the apex, approximately 2–3 mm, into the left ventricle. Insert a perfusion needle through the left ventricle, 5–10 mm into the aorta. Fix the needle position with a clamp.Make an incision in the right atrium to secure drainage and initiate the perfusion. Use Hank´s balanced salt solution (HBSS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+. Perform perfusion with Gilson Miniplus® 3 Pump at 20 mL/min. Terminate prefusion when the liver changes color from red to light brown.Harvest m. gastrocnemius and snap-freeze in N2(ℓ). Store at -80°C for further analysis.Homogenize tissue with a mortar and pestle in N2(l).Continue, for example, with RNA or protein isolation."
