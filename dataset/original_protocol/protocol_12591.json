    "The following protocol is optimized for the human Ntera-2 cell line grown in culture, but it has been successfully adapted without modification to a range of other human cell lines (HEK293, K562, HeLa, U2OS), primary cells (fibroblasts, B-cells) as well as in other organisms with small modifications (mice, flies).\n1. Cell harvest and lysis\nCulture Ntera-2 cells to 75%-85% confluency. Ensure that the optimal cell count is 5 to 6 million cells with >90% viable counts to start any DRIP procedure.\nWash the cells once with 1x PBS, add 1.5 mL of Trypsin-EDTA 1x, and then incubate for 2 min at 37 °C until the cells dissociate from the dish.\nAdd 5 mL of warm media and pipette well to resuspend cells into a single cell suspension. Transfer the content into a new 15 mL tube and gently pellet the cells at 300 x g for 3 min.\nWash the cells once with 5 mL of 1x PBS and gently pellet the cells at 300 x g for 3 min.\nFully resuspend the cells in 1.6 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0). Add 5 µL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL stock solution) and 50 µL of SDS (20% stock solution) and gently invert the tubes five times until the solution become viscous. Do not try to pipette the solution, only mix by inversion.\nIncubate the tubes overnight at 37 °C.\n2. DNA extraction\nPour the DNA lysate into a pre-spun 15 mL high density phase lock gel tube and add 1 volume (1.6 mL) of Phenol/Chloroform Isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Gently invert five times and spin down at 1,500 x g for 5 min.",
    "Add 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate (NaOAc) (pH 5.2) and 2.5 volumes of 100% Ethanol to a new 15 mL tube. Pour in the top aqueous phase from the phase lock gel tube and gently invert until the DNA is fully precipitated (up to 10 min).\nSpool the DNA threads using a wide bore 1,000 µL tip and transfer to a clean 2 mL tube while taking care not to carry over the residual supernatant.\nWash the DNA by adding 1.5 mL of 80% ethanol and gently invert the tube five times. Incubate for 10 min.\nRepeat the previous step twice. Do not centrifuge during the wash steps. Carefully remove as much ethanol as possible by pipetting after the last wash while trying not to disturb the DNA.\nAllow the DNA to air dry completely while inverting the tube. This step can take 30 min -1 h depending on the amount of DNA.\nAdd 125 µL of TE buffer directly on the DNA pellet to fragment the DNA through restriction enzyme digestion or 100 µL of TE buffer to shear the DNA through sonication. Keep on ice for 1 h and gently resuspend the DNA by pipetting a few times with a wide bore 200 µL tip. Leave on ice for 1 h before starting the fragmentation step.\n3. DNA fragmentation\nNOTE: For restriction enzyme-based DRIP-seq, follow step 3.1. For sonication-based DRIP-seq, skip to step 3.2.\nRestriction enzyme (RE) fragmentation\n\t\nDigest the resuspended genomic DNA (very viscous) using a cocktail of REs according to supplier's instructions.\n\t\t\nAdd 0.1 mM spermidine to the final reaction. Use a cocktail of 4-5 enzymes with 30 U of each enzyme in a total volume of 150 µL.",
    "NOTE: The initial cocktail for DRIP-seq (HindIII, SspI, EcoRI, BsrGI, XbaI)4 was developed to generate an average fragment length of 5 kilobases. Avoid any interference with CpG methylation and spare GC-rich regions of the genome. Other cocktails are also possible16). These cocktails are suitable for both the human and mouse genomes but can be adjusted as needed.\nIncubate the reaction mixture overnight at 37 °C.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The DNA mixture post digest should no longer be viscous. Any remaining viscosity at this step is indicative of an incomplete digestion.\nIf observed, add an additional 10 U of each enzyme and incubate for another 2-4 h at 37 °C.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Users may not digest the entire pellet in the event they harvested more cells than recommended here.\nGently pipette the overnight digested DNA (150 µL) into a pre-spun 2 mL phase lock gel light tube. Add 100 µL of water and one volume (250 µL) of Phenol/Chloroform Isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Gently invert five times and spin down at 16,000 x g for 10 min.\nAdd 1.5 µL of glycogen, 1/10 volume of 3 M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2.5 volumes of 100% Ethanol to a new 1.5 mL tube. Pipette the DNA from the phase lock gel tube and mix by inverting five times. Incubate for 1 h at -20 °C.\nSpin at 16,000 x g for 35 min at 4 °C. Wash the DNA with 200 µL of 80% ethanol and spin at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nAir dry the pellet and add 50 µL of TE buffer to the pellet. Leave the tube on ice for 30 min and gently resuspend the DNA.\nMeasure the concentration (OD260) of the fragmented DNA using a spectrophotometer.",
    "Optional but recommended: Load 1 µg of digested DNA on a 0.8% agarose gel alongside a size marker to verify that the digestion is complete. Run the gel for an hour at 100 V.\n\t\tNOTE: If incomplete, additional enzyme can be added. Incomplete digestion can lead to the loss of resolution after immunoprecipitation.\nAfter this step, treat 10 µg of digested DNA with 4 µL of ribonuclease H (RNase H) for 1-2 h at 37 °C to ensure that the signal retrieved upon immunoprecipitation is derived from DNA:RNA hybrids. Then, proceed to S9.6 immunoprecipitation (step 4).\n\t\t​NOTE: The digested DNAs can be kept frozen at -80 °C for up to one month without significant loss of yield.\nSonication\n\t\nSonicate all or a part of the extracted DNA in a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube in 100 µL total volume. Perform 15-20 cycles of 30 s ON / 30 s OFF on a sonicator (spin after 5, 10, and 15 cycles to ensure homogeneous sonication).\nMeasure the concentration (OD260) of sonicated DNA on a spectrophotometer.\n\t\tNOTE: At this step, the viscosity of the DNA should have disappeared.\nRun an agarose gel to confirm the size distribution of the sonicated DNA (300-500 bp).\n\t\t​NOTE: Over-sonicating the DNA can lead to significant reduction in yield resulting from breakage and dissociation of R-loop structures.\nAfter this step, treat 10 µg of sonicated DNA with 4 µL of RNase H for 1-2 h at 37 °C to ensure that the signal retrieved upon immunoprecipitation is derived from DNA:RNA hybrids. Then, proceed to S9.6 immunoprecipitation (step 4).\n4. S9.6 immunoprecipitation\nNOTE: The immunoprecipitation steps are similar regardless of whether DNA was fragmented through REs or sonication.",
    "Prepare three tubes and aliquot 4.4 µg of fragmented DNA in a final volume of 500 µL of TE buffer per tube. Save 50 µL (1/10 of the volume) from each tube to use later as an input DNA.\nAdd 50 µL of 10x binding buffer (100 mM NaPO4 pH 7, 1.4 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100) and 10 µL of S9.6 antibody (1 mg/mL) to the 450 µL of the diluted DNA.\nIncubate overnight at 4 °C on a mini-tube rotator at 7-10 rpm.\nFor each tube, wash 50 µL of Protein A/G agarose bead slurry with 700 µL of 1x binding buffer by inverting the tubes on a mini-rotator at 7-10 rpm at room temperature for 10 min. Spin down the beads at 1,100 x g for 1 min and discard the supernatant. Repeat this step once.\nAdd the DNA from step 4.3 to the 50 µL of beads and incubate for 2 h at 4 °C while inverting at 7-10 rpm on a mini-rotator.\nSpin down the beads for 1 min at 1,100 x g and discard the supernatant.\nWash the beads with 750 µL of 1x binding buffer by inverting at 7-10 rpm on a mini-rotator for 15 min. Spin down for 1 min at 1,100 x g and discard the supernatant. Repeat this step once.\nAdd 250 µL of the elution buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8, 10 mM EDTA pH 8, 0.5% SDS) and 7 µL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL stock) to the beads and incubate with rotation at 55 °C (12 rpm) for 45 min.",
    "Spin down the beads for 1 min at 1,100 x g. Transfer the supernatant to a pre-spun 2 mL phase lock gel light tube and add one volume (250 µL) of Phenol/Chloroform Isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Invert the tubes five times and spin down for 10 min at 16,000 x g at room temperature.\nAdd 1.5 µL of glycogen, 1/10 volume 3M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2.5 volumes of 100% Ethanol to a new 1.5 mL tube. Pipette the DNA from the phase lock gel tube and mix by inverting five times. Incubate for 1 h at -20 °C.\nSpin at 16,000 x g for 35 min at 4 °C. Wash the DNA with 200 µL of 80% ethanol and spin at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nAir dry the pellets and add 15 µL of 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8) in each tube. Leave the tubes on ice for 20 min and gently resuspend. Combine the contents of the three tubes into one tube (45 µL).\nCheck the DRIP efficiency by qPCR using 5 µL of the 45 µL resuspended DNA (see Representative Results). Dilute the 5 µL in 10 µL of water and use 2 µL per reaction.\n5. Pre-library step for sonicated DNA only\nNOTE: Sonication leads the displaced ssDNA strand of R-loops to break. Thus, three-stranded R-loop structures are converted into two-stranded DNA:RNA hybrids upon sonication. As a result, these DNA:RNA hybrids must be converted back to double-stranded DNA prior to library construction. Here, a second strand synthesis step is employed. An alternative approach that has been successfully used is to instead perform a single-stranded DNA ligation followed by a second strand synthesis53.",
    "To the 40 µL of DRIP'ed DNA from step 4.12, add 20 µL of 5x second strand buffer (200 mM Tris pH 7, 22 mM MgCl2, 425 mM KCl), 10 mM dNTP mix (dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTT or dUTP if the user is planning to achieve strand-specific DRIP sequencing), 1 µL 16 mM NAD, and 32 µL water. Mix well and incubate for 5 min on ice.\nAdd 1 µL of DNA polymerase I (10 units), 0.3 µL of RNase H (1.6 units) and 0.5 µL of E. coli DNA ligase. Mix and incubate at 16 °C for 30 min.\nImmediately clean up the reaction using paramagnetic beads with a ratio of 1.6x. Elute the DNA in 40 µL of 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8).\n6. Pre-library sonication step for RE DNA only\nNOTE: DRIP leads to the recovery of RE fragments that are often kilobases in length and thus not suited for immediate library construction.\nTo reduce the size of the material for library construction, sonicate the immunoprecipitated DNA in a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Perform 12 cycles of 15 s ON / 60 s OFF on a sonicator (spin after six cycles to ensure homogeneous sonication). Proceed to step 7.\n\tNOTE: The immunoprecipitated material still carries the three-stranded R-loops which respond to sonication differently than the flanking double-stranded DNA.\nOptional step: To even out DRIP profiles, treat the immunoprecipitated material with 1 µL of RNase H in 1x RNase H buffer for 1 h at 37 °C prior to sonication.\n7. Library construction",
    "Perform end repair by adding to the 40 µL from step 4.12 (RE fragmentation) or step 5.3 (sonication shearing) 5 µL of 10x end repair module buffer, 2.5 µL of 10 mM ATP and 2.5 µL of End repair module enzyme (50 µL total). Mix well and incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Include 1 µg of RE-digested and sonicated (DRIP) or sonicated (sDRIP) input DNA to create control sequencing libraries corresponding to the input DNA.\nClean up the reaction using paramagnetic beads (1.6x ratio) and elute in 34 µL of 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8).\nPerform A-tailing by adding 5 µL of buffer 2, 10 µL of 1 mM dATP, and 1 µL of Klenow exo- (50 µL total). Mix well and incubate the mixture for 30 min at 37 °C.\nClean up the reaction using paramagnetic beads (1.6x ratio) and elute in 12 µL of 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8).\nLigate adapters by adding 15 µL of 2x quick ligation buffer, 1 µL of 15 µM adapters, and 2 µL of quick ligase (30 µL total). Mix well and incubate for 20 min at room temperature.\nClean up the reaction using paramagnetic beads (1x ratio) and elute in 20 µL of 10 mM Tris-Cl (pH 8).\nIf sonication shearing was performed and dUTP was used in step 5.1, add 1.5 µL (1.5 U) of Uracil N-glycosylase and incubate for 30 min at 37 °C to obtain a strand-specific DRIP.\nPCR amplify 10 µL of the library from step 6.6 or 6.7. Add 1 µL of PCR primer 1.0 P5 (see Table of Materials), 1 µL of PCR primer 2.0 P7 (see Table of Materials), 15 µL of master mix, and 3 µL of water. Mix well.",
    "In a thermo cycler, run the program as shown in Table 1.\nProceed to a two-step clean-up of the library using paramagnetic beads. First use a ratio of 0.65x to remove fragments over 500 bp. Keep the supernatant. Proceed to a 1x ratio on the supernatant to remove fragments under 200 bp. Elute in 12 µL of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8).\n8. Quality control\nTo check R-loop enrichments with qPCR on two negative and three positive loci using the Pfaffl method, use 1 µL of the clean-up library from step 6.10. Dilute 1 µL of the library in 10 µL of water and use 2 µL per locus.\nCheck the size distribution of the cleaned-up library from step 6.10 using a high sensitivity DNA kit.\nSubscription Required.
