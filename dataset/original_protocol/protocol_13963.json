    "All procedures were reviewed and approved by the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB). To recruit healthy participants, posters were used to advertise around the hospital.\n1. Experimental set-up\nParticipant recruitment\n\t\nPerform the subject screening process using the following inclusion criteria: 1) healthy, between 18 and 50 years old; 2) right-handed, assessed by Edinburgh handedness inventory14; 3) able to wear the head mount display for VR and to detect objects within VR; and 4) no history of diseases affecting the brain, such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, or traumatic brain injury.\n\t\tNOTE: These criteria were designed to screen participants with the ability to participate in the experiment and regulate factors affecting the results.\nRecruit participants and provide a detailed explanation of the entire study and expected clinical issues. Consent must be obtained prior to inclusion.\nExperimental system\n\tNOTE: A customized VPAT system using an immersive VR system and depth-sensing camera was used. Functional infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) was simultaneously used to investigate the cortical activation. VPAT and fNIRS were linked together for the experiment (Figure 1).\n\t\nVPAT system\n\t\tNOTE: The VPAT system consists of a head mount display for VR implementation, a hand tracking sensor that can recognize hand gestures for intuitive input by the user, and a hardware push button. The overall composition is shown in Figure 1.\n\t\t\nMake sure that the hand tracking sensor is not tilted in front of the head mount display.\nCheck that the reference camera for the VR system is properly installed on top of the front monitor.\nSecure the push button in a location near the hand to be used by the participant for the experiment.\nRun the software to make sure there are no errors.",
    "NOTE: The virtual environment was implemented to match the actual environment as close as possible. The task was performed through hand pointing within the virtual environment and button input through the push button.\nfNIRS\n\t\t\nUse a commercial fNIRS system including a personal computer (PC), 31 optodes (15 light sources and 16 detectors), textile EEG caps, and data recording software.\nLinkage between VPAT system and fNIRS (Figure 1).\n\t\t\nUse the remote keyboard control software using TCP/IP communication to synchronize the starting event in the VPAT system with the timing of recording in the fNIRS system.\nUse the remote command key in the computer to start fNIRS recording.\n2. Experimental set-up (Figure 2)\nfNIRS measurement setting\n\t\nPlace the participant in a chair with his/her back in a straight posture, about fifteen centimeters away from the table. Confirm that the participant's hand does not hit the table when reaching out.\nFor fNIRS cap setting, select the cap size according to the participant's head circumference. Place the cap so that the vertex (Cz) is located at the intersection of the midpoint between the inion and nasion and the midpoint between the left preauricular and right preauricular areas. Display the montage on the screen and connect 15 sources and 24 detectors to the montage. If necessary to improve the gain from the light source, use conductive gel after hair preparation and insert the optode. Have the participant wear a retaining cap.\n\t\tNOTE: The study used three different sizes of textile EEG caps with circumferences of 54, 56, and 58 cm.\nFor software setting (calibration, etc.), run the fNIRS system software and load the neglect montage.\nLet the montage be displayed on the screen and set 15 sources and 24 detectors according to the montage (Figure 3).",
    "Press the calibrate button. If \"Lost\" is displayed on the screen, repeat the hair preparation, and then recalibrate.\nVPAT system setting\n\t\nConnect the HMD, reference camera, and Leap motion camera, and push the button connecting the computer to set up the VPAT system.\nMount the virtual reality head-mounted display (VR HMD) on the participant's head over the cap for fNIRS. Make sure to avoid movement of the cap.\nRun the VPAT software. Enter the participant's information (name abbreviation, age, handedness) and press the \"Start\" button.\nConfirm the visualization of the virtual hand in the display. Proceed with a two-step calibration (i.e., screen calibration and target distance calibration).\nInstruct the participant to watch the red cross mark (+) in the center, then press the \"r\" key to calibrate the screen.\n\t\tNOTE: Screen calibration places the virtual space in front of the user's visual range by recentering the coordinate system.\nInstruct the participant to point to the target (i.e., ball) with his or her right hand, then press the \"O\" key to calibrate the hand position.\n\t\tNOTE: In our study, the object that the participant had to target was a white ball on a pink stick that came down from the top of the view. Target distance calibration places the target within the reach of the user. This is used to correctly position the target during the experiment.\nAfter calibration, press the \"w\" key to begin the experiment.\nVPAT and fNIRS linkage setting\n\t\nUse the event synchronization software to enter the trigger for analysis into fNIRS and connect VPAT to fNIRS.\nFor time synchronization between VPAT and fNIRS, connect the computers with the two systems to the same network, and then synchronize them through the self-produced key transferring program.",
    "After connecting through the IP and Port inputs of both computers, start the experiment session via the \"w\" key in the VPAT program. The event synchronization software is executed automatically, and triggers during execution are automatically transferred to fNIRS and saved.\nAfter the experiment, obtain the software auto-termination and VPAT data. Then stop the VPAT and fNIRS system software.\n\t\tNOTE: The participants must return their hands to their original position after pointing during the VPAT experiment.\n3. Experiment to validate VPAT system\nBlock designed experiment with fNIRS recording (Figure 4)\n\t\nAfter completing the set-up process in step 2, confirm the participant's readiness to start the experiment.\nStart the VPAT system without the prism mode and instruct the participant to point to the target in the VR system immediately for familiarization with the procedure.\nEach phase consists of blocks for pointing, clicking, or resting (Figure 4). Again, instruct the participant to click on the button or point to the target in the VR system with their right index finger as quickly as possible.\nStart the experiment with four phases simultaneously with fNIRS recording by clicking the start key.\n\t\tNOTE: During the pointing task, the white ball had to be touched within a fixed time.\n\t\t\nInstruct the participants to point, click, or rest when the appropriate icon appears.\n\t\t\tNOTE: During the task, pointing and clicking were indicated by an icon directly above the white ball and right side of the timer bar. The time to perform the task was indicated by the timer bar as shown in Figure 2.\nTell the participant to touch the target that appears on the left or right side within 3 s. For the clicking block, instruct the participant to press the push button.",
    "NOTE: The target set containing the white ball was located at a distance of -10° or 10° from the participant's center, obtained by calibration. The target set appeared randomly on the right or left side. According to the experimental design, the target appeared for 3 s, then disappeared, and then regenerated to a new position.\nEnsure that the participant performs the same way when the phase is switched.\n\t\t\tNOTE: In the pointing task, Virtual Prism Adaptation Mode showed a deviation of 10° or 20° to the left side of the imaginary hand in the VR space relative to the participant's head. Zero degrees indicated that the positions of the virtual hand and the actual hand coincided.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The experiment (Figure 4) consists of a total of four phases, with each phase consisting of pointing and clicking or rest alternately (Phase 1 and 4 were pointing and clicking, and phase 2 and 3 were pointing and resting).\n4. Data analysis\nPointing error analysis\n\tNOTE: The data were stored from the moment the experimenter pressed the start button \"w\". The data were automatically stored at about 60 Hz every frame through the VPAT software. The phase name, elapsed time, and virtual index finger position were stored over time. The pointing error was the angle value between the target and index finger, centered on the participant's head position.\n\t\nClassify the pointing task data by phases (pre-VPAT, VPAT 10°, VPAT 20°, post-VPAT).\nClassify the data of the pointing task and the clicking task in the data of each phase (phase 1 and 4).\nClassify the data by sub-phase in units of 30 s according to each phase and each type of task.\nExtract the median value of 10 trial error (pointing error) values from the index finger position data for median pointing error analysis.",
    "Use the repeated measures analysis of variance test (ANOVA) to analyze the difference between each phase.\n\t\tNOTE: In the case of hand tracking using the Leap motion sensor, outliers were due to occlusion or false detection of the hand posture. With the exception of false hand position data, the median value was used to find the representative pointing error value in the sub-phase.\nfNIRS data processing\n\t\nLaunch the fNIRS analysis software and load the raw data file and probe information.\nPerform a marker setting process by editing the event record to verify each condition during the experiment.\nCarry out data preprocessing by deleting the experimentally irrelevant time intervals, remove artifacts, such as steps and spikes, and apply frequency filters to exclude experimentally irrelevant frequency bands.\n\t\tNOTE: All data sets were filtered with a 0.01 Hz high-pass filter and a 0.2 Hz low-pass filter to remove instrumental or physiological noise contributions.\nSpecify wavelengths by entering the value of the peak illumination wavelengths (i.e., 760 and 850 nm). Use a physical distance of 3 cm between the source and detector for channel.\nSelect the baseline field, which refers to the time period that corresponds to a baseline wherein participants are typically resting quietly.\n\t\tNOTE: We selected the baseline field as the full-time course of the data set, which was the default setting.\nCompute the time series of hemodynamic states to finish the preprocessing from the filtered data.\nSubscription Required.
