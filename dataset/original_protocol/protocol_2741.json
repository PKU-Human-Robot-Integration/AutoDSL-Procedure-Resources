    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nT0 generation\nTiming: 3 months\nThis section describes the production and confirmation of T0 transgenic plants.\nSelect the transformed calli in a growth medium containing antibiotic (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], step 5).\nGrow the antibiotic-resistant calli on the regeneration medium to obtain T0 plants (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], steps 6 and 7).\nTransfer the two weeks old putative transgenic seedlings to polyhouse for further growth.\nExtract the DNA from T0 plants by using the CTAB method or by using a commercial plant DNA extraction kit.\nUse the extracted DNA to confirm the presence of the transgene (GOI) in the T0 plants by PCR using specific primers as described in Abdalla.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nUse any constitutively expressed gene (e.g., Actin/Ubiquitin) as an endogenous positive control.\nNote: During gene transformation in plants the transgene can integrate randomly into the host plant genome. The inserted GOI can interfere with other parts of the host genome; coding regions, non-coding regions, epigenetic regions etc. Also, the expression level of the transgene varies with its location (Euchromatin or Heterochromatin) of the insertion. Thus, it is highly important to select at least 3–6 independent transgenic events (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], step 7) to obtain homozygous lines to make sure the phenotype is due to the GOI and not because of the above-mentioned possibilities of interference by GOI.\nT1 generation\nTiming: 8 days\nThis section describes the segregation pattern in T1 seeds.\nFrom the PCR confirmed independent events of T0 plants, collect independently the matured T1 seeds from each plant (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nIncubate the collected T1 seeds for drying at 37°C for 48 h and store them in a paper bag at room temperature with proper labeling till further use.",
    "Critical: While harvesting seeds from different plants, to avoid any cross-contamination of seeds, make sure to label each paper bag properly with details including the name of the gene construct, transgenic generation, and collection date.\nPrepare about 100 mL ½ strength MS media with 0.5% agar) in 2 Tarson’s plantons (glass container each and autoclave. After the autoclave, add the appropriate antibiotic (hygromycin-50 mg/L) and mix properly and allow for solidification.\nTake about 30 T1 dehusked (manually remove the husk from the seed without damaging the embryo) seeds from independent events and 10 wild Type (WT) dehusked seeds in separate 15 mL tubes.\nSurface sterilize the seeds with 70% ethanol for 90 s followed by 2% of sodium hypochlorite with 0.05% of Tween 20. Keep the tubes on a rotary shaker for 1 h at 180 rpm. Rinse the seeds with sterile distilled water 3–4 times to remove sodium hypochlorite completely. Dry the seeds on sterile blotting paper to remove the moisture content.\nPlace the sterilized T1 seeds and WT seeds (as a negative control) in the plantons containing selection media ½ MS + hygromycin 50 mg/L (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2402-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Phenotype of WT and transgenic plants on selection medium\n(A) Sterilized WT and transgenic seeds placed on selection media containing antibiotic.\n(B) 10 days old survived transgenic plants on selection medium.\nCritical: Ensure forceps used for placing sterile seeds are sterilized properly to avoid contamination.\nKeep the plantons for seed germination at 27°C for 6 days under controlled conditions in the plant growth chamber (light: dark period 10:14 h, relative humidity 60%, and light intensity 230 μM/s-1).\nAfter 6 days count the number of germinated seedlings of the T1 population (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).",
    "As described above, if the antibiotic-resistant gene follows Mendelian segregation, 70%–80% of the seedlings’ will survive on the selection plate (In our case we observed that out of 30 seeds 22 survived and the rest along with WT did not germinate/survive i.e., a 73% survival rate was observed).\nIf all the T1 seeds survive on the selection medium, such an event should be considered as multiple transgene insertion lines.\nNote: Mendelian law of segregation: Plant transformation results in the development of different types of transgenic events including, the production of hemizygous condition for the gene of interest (GOI), multiple insertions of the transfer DNA (t-DNA), lethality, male gametophytic lethal, and female gametophytic lethal phenotypes. All these different types of events can give rise to different mendelian segregation. This protocol holds good for single-copy gene insertion which would be in hemizygous status. Please note, this protocol cannot be used if the transgene insertion leads to lethality in the target plant.According to the law of segregation, ‘A diploid individual possesses a pair of an allele for any particular trait and each parent passes the alleles randomly to its next generation. Here GOI corresponds to the dominant trait and therefore its inheritance to the next generation leads to the formation of a 1:2:1 phenotype ratio and genotypic ratio of 3:1. This ratio gives 25% homozygous for GOI, 50% hemizygous for GOI (segregating population), and 25% for the homozygous wild type.\nThe 70%–80% of survived seedlings contain a mixture of homozygous (25%) and hemizygous seedlings (50%) in the ratio 1:2:1 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nT2 generation\nTiming: 3 months\nThis step explain the procedure to differentiate and select homozygous plants on selction medium.",
    "Grow the surviving T1 seedlings (about 20) individually (Label them as Plant 1(P1) to plant 20 (P20) in the polyhouse and collect the next generation seeds (T2) separately from the individual T1 plants.\nGrow the collected T2 seeds (About 30–40) from the individual T1 plants (P1-P20) separately along with the WT seeds on the antibiotic selection medium (Repeat steps 7–9).\nAfter 6 days of incubation in the plant growth chamber, count the number of surviving seeds from the individual plants. Look for the selection plate where all the seeds have survived (100% survival).\nOut of 20 T2 seed populations, at least 6–7 of them will show 100% survival on the selection medium.\nThe Petri plate in which all the T2 plants survived can be considered as the homozygous transgenic line for the GOI.\nT3 generation\nTiming: 3 months\nThis step is used for mass multiplication of selected homozygous plants.\nThe T2 homozygous plants (PCR confirmed) will be grown in the greenhouse for seed multiplication and to collect the homozygous stable T3 transgenic seeds."
