    "NOTE: See the Table of Materials for details about all materials used in this protocol.\n1. Preparing experimental plates\nPrepare 35 mm diameter Petri dishes with Modified Youngren's, Only Bacto-peptone (MYOB) media. To make MYOB plates, add 20 g of Bacto agar, 2 g of NaCl, 0.55 g of Trizma-HCl, 0.24 g of Trizma-OH, 3.1 g of Bacto peptone, and 1.6 mL of cholesterol to 1 L of ddH2O and autoclave for 40 min at 121 °C. Let it cool to 55 °C and using sterile technique, pour 4 mL of the molten media into each 35 mm Petri dish.\n\tNOTE: A liter of MYOB makes ~250 plates, which can be stored at 4 °C for up to 6 months. We recommend a minimum of 10 individuals per replicate with three replicate sets for each strain.\nUsing sterile technique, seed the plates with a small spot (approximately 50 µL) of OP50 bacteria in the middle of the plate.\n\tNOTE: Small lawns are especially important for assessing cross-fertilization as the smaller spot leads to increased encounters between males and hermaphrodites, thus increasing the chance of mating.\n2. Embryonic viability assays (hermaphrodite self-fertilization)\nDay 1\n\t\nLabel the back of each plate. Be sure to keep track of each plate and their respective worms throughout the experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: Preferred labeling technique-Day 1: worm 1, Day 1: worm 2, … etc.\nTransfer an individual L4 stage hermaphrodite onto each plate. Ensure no embryos or other worms are transferred onto the plate. Allow the worms to develop into adults and lay self-progeny for 24 h at the standard culturing temperature of 20 °C. Score these plates on day 3.",
    "NOTE: The temperature of experiments can be altered in the case of temperature-sensitive mutations. For temperature sensitive mutations, embryonic viability assays should be performed at both the permissive (15-16 °C) and nonpermissive temperatures (24-26 °C).\nDay 2\n\t\nLabel a set of new plates-Day 2: worm 1, Day 2: worm 2, … etc.\nTransfer day 1 individual worms onto the new plates.\n\t\tNOTE: These worms should have reached adulthood, and wild-type worms should have already started laying embryos.\nAllow the worms to lay embryos for 24 h at 20 °C or other appropriate temperature. Score these plates on day 4.\nDay 3\n\t\nLabel a set of new plates. Day 3: worm 1, Day 3: worm 2, … etc.\nTransfer day 2 individual worms onto new plates. Allow them to lay progeny for 24 h at 20 °C or other appropriate temperature. Score these plates on day 5.\n\t\tNOTE: In cases of lower temperatures, hatching times will be increased. Adjust accordingly.\nDraw a grid pattern on a 35 mm lid using a fine marker. Place the gridded lid under the test plate for counting to keep track of worms previously counted (Figure 1A-B).\n\t\t\nUsing a differential cell counter, score the day 1 plates for the presence or absence of progeny. Count the live larvae and unhatched embryos.\n\t\t\tNOTE: At this point, a sufficient time has lapsed such that any viable embryos should have hatched. Any unhatched embryos are presumed dead.\nWithin an individual square, count the unhatched embryos and live larvae that are entirely within the square (Figure 1C-F).",
    "For worms that are on the square borders, count based on the location of the worm head. Count worms with heads touching the top and left edges of the square (do not count those touching the bottom or right edges; Figure 1D). Do not count unfertilized oocytes for this assay (Figure 1F).\nRecord the number of live larvae and unhatched embryos in a laboratory notebook.\nDay 4\n\t\nScore the day 2 plates by counting the live larvae and unhatched embryos, as described in step 2.3.3.1. Record the number of live larvae and unhatched embryos in a laboratory notebook.\nDay 5\n\t\nScore the day 3 plates by counting the live larvae and unhatched embryos, as described in step 2.3.3.1. Record the number of live larvae and unhatched embryos in a laboratory notebook. Analyze the data obtained using the method described in the data analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: Some genetic mutants may have either a delayed or expanded reproductive cycle. Monitor individual strains for the continued laying of embryos beyond the day 3 plates. If embryo production has not ceased by day 4, continue to transfer adults to new plates.\n3. Embryonic viability assays (male/hermaphrodite cross-fertilization)\nDay 1\n\t\nLabel the back of each plate. Be sure to keep track of each plate and their respective worms throughout the experiment.\nTransfer an individual L4 hermaphrodite worm onto each plate. Ensure no embryos or other worms are transferred onto the plate.\n\t\tNOTE: Feminized strains, such as fog-2 loss-of-function mutants, which do not produce sperm, can be used in place of hermaphrodites.\nTransfer a single L4 male worm onto each labeled plate containing a L4 hermaphrodite. Ensure no embryos or other worms are transferred onto the plate.",
    "NOTE: Strains such as plg-1 variant males can be used to identify whether mating has occurred, as these males deposit a copulatory plug on the hermaphrodite vulva after mating.\nAllow the worms to mate and lay progeny for 24 h at 20 °C, or another appropriate temperature. Score these plates for live larvae versus unhatched embryos on day 3.\nDay 2\n\t\nLabel a set of new plates and transfer the worms, as in day 2 above. In this case, make sure to transfer both the hermaphrodite and male onto new plates. Ensure that the hermaphrodite has reached adulthood.\nAllow the hermaphrodites to lay progeny for 24 h at 20 °C, or another appropriate temperature. Score these plates for live larvae versus unhatched embryos on day 4.\nDay 3\n\t\nLabel a set of new plates and transfer the worms, as in day 3 above. Make sure to transfer both the hermaphrodite and male onto new plates.\nAllow to lay progeny for 24 h at 20 °C, or another appropriate temperature. Score these plates for live versus unhatched embryos on day 5.\nUsing a differential cell counter, count the live larvae and unhatched embryos from the day 1 plates, as described in step 2.3.3.1.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not discard the plates, as they are required for day 4.\nRecord the number of live larvae and unhatched embryos in a laboratory notebook.\nDay 4\n\t\nCount the live progeny and unhatched embryos from the day 2 plates, as described in step 2.3.3.1. Record the number of live larvae and unhatched embryos in a laboratory notebook.",
    "Check the day 1 plates for males. If mating has occurred, the expected genetic ratio of hermaphrodites to males should be 50:50. If day 1 plates do not contain any males, mating between the male and hermaphrodite did not occur. Discard this mating pair and record this observation in the laboratory notebook.\nDay 5\n\t\nCount the live larvae and unhatched embryos from the day 3 plates, as described in step 2.3.3.1. Record the number of live larvae and unhatched embryos in a laboratory notebook. Analyze the data obtained using the methods described in the data analysis.\n4. Data analysis\nCalculate the embryonic viability percentage of a given biological replicate of a strain using equation (1).\n\tNOTE: The numbers of live progeny and unhatched embryos are obtained by totaling the daily count across the experimental period.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65064/65064eq01.jpg      (1)\nCalculate the brood size per worm of a given strain by summing the number of progeny (unhatched embryos and larvae) produced by the parent hermaphrodite. Calculate the average brood size using equation (2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65064/65064eq02.jpg      (2)\nReport the embryonic viability percentage and average brood size with the average and standard deviation between biological replicates. Perform Student's t-test comparing the control and experimental data."
