    "1. Installation of Dynamic Tissue System\nExclude if there is hemodynamic instability, a need for further abdominal washouts, or a concern for intraabdominal sepsis.\n\t\nIf an ostomy exists, trim the ostomy wafer to make as narrow as possible and outline on abdominal skin. Cover ostomy with 4x4 and secure in place with adhesive transparent film dressing.\nApply antimicrobial betadine impregnated adhesive drape to the skin of the abdomen widely, covering the operating field.\nWash the abdomen out with at least 2 L of 40.5° C normal saline.\nMeasure and record the myofascial gap (MFG), visceral extrusion (VE), and the length of incision in centimeters for documentation of progress on the operative note.\nMark the skin of the anterior abdominal wall 5 cm laterally from medial fascial edge to create an ellipse around the midline wound.\nPlace the elastomer buttons side by side on the ellipse created in step 1.1.5. with the “U” of the elastomer at the 5 cm ellipse demarcation around the midline wound. This will assure 3 cm spacing as recommended.\nCreate superficial thickness dermotomies with an 11 blade.\nPull the elastomer through the abdominal wall using the cannulator.\nRepeat the same steps on the opposite side. This time pull the elastomer across the myofascial gap and secure both ends with a hemostat.\nLoosely attach the elastomer bands to the elastomer buttons. Do not tighten elastomer bands.\nAttach elastomer adhesion stickers on the button tails.\nPerform osteopathic maneuvers throughout installation. This is performed with two people standing on either side of the patient. Apply bimanual forces in the flank area, gently massaging towards the midline and create circular motions synchronized with the other operator first towards the head and then creating circular motions towards the feet.\n2. Silicone Visceral Protector Inserted",
    "Insert silicone visceral protector midline over abdominal viscera, taking care to protect any ostomies (Figure 3).\nEnvelop the abdominal viscera with silicone visceral protector down to each paracolic gutter.\nCreate necessary cut outs in the visceral protector with scissors to protect the ostomies.\nPlace elastomer retainer in the midline on top of visceral protector and evenly space elastomer bands into the retainer (trim to size).\nAdjust elastomer bands slowly in between osteopathic maneuvers.\nStop elastomer adjustments when tension hashmarks across the MFG is 1.5 – 2x stretch.\nRecord the MFG and VE with a ruler in centimeters at the start, install, and completion (Figure 4).\n3. Installation of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy Device\nMake NPWT device sponge as thing as possible and place in the midline above the elastomer retainer (Figure 5).\nCover with vacuum drape tape and apply the negative pressure device with continuous suction at -100 mmHg.\nPerform osteopathic maneuver a few more times.\n4. Elastomer Adjustment\nBring the patient back to operating room, or if your facility has the capability to perform in ICU, periodically. First elastomer adjustment can be 2 – 5 days after installation.\nRemove the NPWT device overlying the midline wound with scissors, taking care to leave the adhesive iodine drape on the skin intact.\nPrep the abdomen widely including the elastomers in place with 4% chlorhexidine gluconate.\nPerform osteopathic maneuvers intermittently throughout procedure. See step 1.1.12. for details.\nRecord the MFG and myofascial apposition (Figure 6).\nIrrigate the midline wound with at least 2 L of 40.5° C normal saline, taking care not to spill water on the DTS or the antimicrobial iodine impregnated adhesive drape.\nAdjust elastomers by releasing the elastomer from the anchor and pulling each elastomer laterally, away from the midline.\nReapply the black sponge NPWT device.\n5. Fascial Closure",
    "Bring the patient back to the operating room. Prep widely.\nRemove the elastomer retainer.\nRemove the visceral protector and irrigate the abdominal cavity with at least 2 L of normal saline.\nClose the fascia in a bi-directional fashion utilizing a Smead-Jones technique and a #2 vicryl suture on a TP1 needle.\nIrrigate and dry the midline wound.\nApply PUBM micromatrix powder to the midline wound and evenly distribute the powder so that the newly created linea alba is covered in PUBM micromatrix.\nHydrate a two-layer, 10x15 cm, PUBM wound sheet and delaminate so there are 2 single sheets. Apply the sheets on top of the powder to cover the entire midline wound surface (Figure 7).\nAppose skin edge with strips of vac drape tape (Figure 8).\nSubscription Required.
