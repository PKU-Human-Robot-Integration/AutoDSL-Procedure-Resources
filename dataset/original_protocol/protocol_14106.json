    "1. Preparation\nPrepare buffer and reagents.\n\t\nMake 1x Reaction Buffer by combining 20 µL of 1 M Tris (pH = 8.0), 40 µL of 5 M sodium chloride, 2.5 µL of 2 M magnesium chloride, 100 µL of 50% (v/v) glycerol, and RNase-free water to reach a total volume of 1 mL.\nMake urea loading dye by combining 4.8 g of urea, 200 µL of 1 M Tris (pH = 8.0), 20 µL of 0.5 M EDTA (pH = 8.0), 0.5 mL of 1% (w/v) bromophenol blue, and RNase-free water to reach a total volume of 10 mL.\nMake 10x TBE buffer by combining 108 g of Tris base, 55 g of boric acid, 40 mL of 0.5 M EDTA (pH = 8.0), and RNase-free water to reach a total volume of 1 L.\nMake 10% (w/v) ammonium persulfate (APS). Weigh 0.5 g of APS and add 3 mL of RNase-free water to dissolve the solid. Add RNase-free water to reach a total volume of 5 mL. Wrap the tube in foil and store the solution at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Dissolved APS decays over time. Replace the 10% APS stock every 2 weeks.\nObtain polynucleotide kinase enzyme.\n\t\nAcquire pure Las1-Grc3 PNK enzyme2 stored in Reaction Buffer (see step 1.1.1) in a stock concentration of 20 μM. The storage buffer will vary depending on the specific PNK.\nPrepare nucleic acid substrate.\n\tNOTE: This protocol monitors 5'-phosphorylation of a 27 nt RNA substrate that harbors the Las1-Grc3 processing site (C2 site) contained within the Saccharomyces cerevisiae pre-ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 2 (SC-ITS2; see Table 1)2,25,26.",
    "Chemically synthesize an RNA oligonucleotide substrate containing a 5'-hydroxyl end along with a 3'-fluorescent label. The fluorophore will be used for the visualization of the RNA. Ensure that the fluorophore is positioned on the RNA end that is not targeted for phosphorylation. As an alternative to commercial sources, internal and terminal fluorescent labeling of RNA substrates can be performed in-house using cost-effective protocols27.\nRemove excess fluorophore from the RNA labeling reaction by HPLC-purification28.\nResuspend the lyophilized RNA using RNase-free water to 500 nM.\nStore RNA aliquots at -80 °C for long-term storage or -20 °C for short-term storage.\nPrepare the ATP concentration series.\n\t\nMake a 20 mM working stock of ATP using Reaction Buffer (see step 1.1.1). Use this working stock to generate four serial dilutions ranging from 20 mM-0.02 mM.\nTo make the first dilution of the concentration series, mix 1 μL of the 20 mM ATP working stock with 9 μL of Reaction Buffer. This will result in a 10-fold dilution of the ATP with a final concentration of 2 mM.\nUse the 2 mM ATP stock generated in step 1.4.2 to make the next dilution in the concentration series. Mix 1 μL of the 2 mM ATP stock with 9 μL of Reaction Buffer. This will make a new ATP stock concentration of 0.2 mM.\nContinue diluting 1 μL of the previous ATP stock with 9 μL of Reaction Buffer to make the subsequent ATP stock in the concentration series.\n2. In vitro RNA kinase reaction\nNOTE: This assay can be used to measure several variables such as time, nucleotide levels, or enzyme concentration. The goal of this experiment is to assess the amount of phosphorylated RNA in the presence of constant Las1-Grc3 complex and varying ATP levels.",
    "For each RNA-enzyme kinase reaction, combine 1 μL of 500 nM RNA substrate, 8.3 μL of 130 nM Las1-Grc3, and 0.2 μL of 5 mM EDTA.\n\tNOTE: If carrying out several reactions, prepare a master stock of the RNA-enzyme mixture and aliquot 9.5 μL of this master mix to each reaction tube.\nStart the assay.\n\t\nSet the heat block to 37 °C.\nAt 10 s intervals, mix 0.5 μL of one ATP substock from the ATP concentration series prepared in step 1.4 with one RNA-enzyme mixture and place the reaction in the 37 °C heat block.\n\t\tNOTE: Add 0.5 μL of Reaction Buffer instead of ATP to one RNA-enzyme mixture for a PNK negative control. Use another necessary control as well (i.e., RNA substrate in the absence of PNK enzyme).\nIncubate the reactions for 60 min at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Fluorescently-labeled RNA is light sensitive; therefore, cover the reactions with foil.\nUsing the same order as in step 2.2.2, quench each reaction every 10 s by spiking the reaction with 10 μL of urea loading dye (see step 1.1.2).\n\t\tNOTE: In addition to 4 M urea, proteinase K may be added at this step to degrade the enzyme. Follow the instructions provided by the supplier to determine the required protease amount and reaction conditions.\nUse the quenched in vitro RNA kinase reactions immediately for downstream analysis (see section 3) or store at -20 °C to be analyzed at a later date.\n3. Gel electrophoresis\nPrepare 15% acrylamide/8 M urea gel solution.\n\tCAUTION: Acrylamide must be handled with care, because it is a neurotoxin. Always wear gloves, a lab coat, and goggles when handling it.",
    "In a 150 mL glass beaker, combine 22.5 mL of premixed 40% acrylamide/bis-acrylamide 29:1 solution, 6 mL of 10x TBE (see step 1.1.3), 28.8 g of urea, and RNase-free water to a total volume of 59 mL. Gently stir the solution.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the RNA substrate length, altering the percentage of polyacrylamide may improve the resolution between unphosphorylated and phosphorylated RNA.\nTo dissolve the urea, heat the solution in the microwave for 20 s, stir the liquid, and immediately place the solution back into the microwave for another 20 s. Gently stir the solution until the urea completely dissolves.\nSlowly cool the solution by placing the glass beaker into a shallow water bath containing cold water. Make sure that the level of cold water surrounding the glass beaker is above the level of solution inside the glass beaker. This will promote efficient heat transfer. Wait 5 min.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not continue with this protocol if the glass beaker feels warm; the water should be below 25 °C. If it still feels warm after 5 min, then replace the water in the water bath with fresh cold water and wait another 5 min.\nFilter and degas the solution using a 0.22 μm disposable filtration unit to remove particulates and microscopic air bubbles.\nPour the denaturing gel.\n\t\nUse soap and warm water to clean a short and long glass plate designed for gels with overall dimensions of 31.0 cm x 38.5 cm. Spray each glass plate with 95% ethanol and wipe the glass to remove any moisture.\n\t\tNOTE: One of the two plates can be siliconized to prevent damage to the gel when separating the glass plate sandwich. However, this step is not necessary because this protocol is designed to visualize the RNA without separating the glass plates.",
    "Place the long glass plate horizontally on top of a box so it is elevated off the benchtop.\n\t\tCAUTION: Acrylamide is toxic, therefore the gel pouring station must be covered in bench paper that can absorb any spilled liquid and be immediately placed in a waste bag after the procedure is complete.\nPlace a clean 0.4 mm spacer along the long edges of the long glass plate.\nLay the short glass plate atop the long plate and ensure the edges of the short plate, long plate, and spacers are aligned. Clamp each side using three evenly spaced metal clamps.\nAdd 24 μL of TEMED to the 15% acrylamide/8 M urea solution prepared in step 3.1 and mix the solution.\nAdd 600 μL of 10% (w/v) APS (see step 1.1.4) to the solution in step 3.2.5 and gently mix the solution.\nImmediately pour the solution between the glass plates.\n\t\tNOTE: To avoid bubbles, tap the glass as the solution is poured.\nCarefully add a clean, 0.4 mm, 32 well comb to the top of the glass plate sandwich.\nAllow a minimum of 30 min for the acrylamide to polymerize.\nRun the denaturing gel.\n\t\nSet the heat block to 75 °C.\nRemove the metal clamps holding the glass plate sandwich together and thoroughly wash and dry the glass plate sandwich.\nPlace the glass plate sandwich into the gel apparatus with the short plate facing inward.\nPrepare 0.5x TBE running buffer by combining 100 mL of 10x TBE with 1.9 L RNase-free water. Add 600 mL of the running buffer to the upper and lower chambers of the gel apparatus.\nGently remove the comb and rinse the wells thoroughly using a syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is critical for removing urea from the wells.",
    "Pre-run the gel for 30 min at 50 W. Voltage is approximately 2,000 V.\n\t\tCAUTION: This gel apparatus operates at a high wattage and users should exhibit precaution.\nRinse the wells thoroughly using a syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is critical for even loading of sample into the wells.\nPulse spin the quenched reactions from step 2.2.5. Then incubate the tubes at 75 °C for 3 min. Repeat the pulse spin.\nImmediately load 10 μL of sample per well and run the gel for 3 h at 50 W.\n\t\tNOTE: Fluorescently-labeled RNA is light sensitive; therefore, cover the gel apparatus with foil.\nImage the denaturing gel.\n\t\nTurn off the power supply and drain the upper chamber of the gel apparatus.\nWash and dry the outer side of the glass plate sandwich using soap and water. Cover the glass plate sandwich with foil while transporting the gel.\nMount the glass plate sandwich onto the stage of a laser scanner capable of quantitative and sensitive fluorescence detection.\n\t\tNOTE: This gel is extremely thin for maximum resolution. For this reason, this protocol is designed to avoid the difficulties of removing the gel from the glass plate sandwich by directly visualizing the fluorescently-labeled RNA through the glass plates. The use of commercially available low-fluorescence glass plates will increase the captured signal by improving the signal-to-noise ratio.\nSet the excitation and emission wavelengths of the laser scanner for the desired fluorophore.\n\t\tNOTE: The optimal excitation and emission wavelengths may differ for specific fluorophores. For the FAM fluorophore, the excitation and emission wavelengths are 495 nm and 535 nm, respectively.\nDefine the area to be visualized on the laser scanner stage and image the gel according to the manufacturer's instructions (Figure 1).\n4. Image analysis and signal quantification",
    "Load the digital gel image acquired in step 3.4.5 into image procesing software (see Table of Materials).\nUsing the left button of the mouse, click and drag a rectangle to define a template box to mark the boundaries on the digital gel image that will be used to quantify each RNA band. The RNA band seen in the the reaction mixture set in the absence of PNK enzyme is usually a good band to generate this template.\n\tNOTE: To avoid bias caused by background signal, it is critical that the area surrounding each RNA band being measured is identical. For this reason, it is best to use the same template box to demarcate each RNA band.\nOpen the ROI Manager under \"Tools\" and mark the position of the template box by clicking \"Add\".\n\tNOTE: Quantitation programs can also draw boxes automatically following the software user manual.\nUsing the left button of the mouse, click and drag the template box over to the next RNA band and repeat step 4.3. Continute this process until the position of all the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated RNA bands in each reaction have been marked.\nMeasure the integrated density within each box by clicking \"Measure\" in the ROI Manager.\nTo calculate the relative amount of phosphorylated RNA in a reaction, divide the integrated density of the phosphorylated RNA band by the sum of the integrated densities of the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated RNA bands from the same reaction. This approach can also be applied to calculate the relative amount of unphosphorylated RNA.\nTo visualize the accumulation of phosphorylated RNA product and the corresponding depletion of unphosphorylated RNA substrate across the ATP concentration series, plot the relative amount of RNA calculated in step 4.6 against the concentration of ATP.\nSubscription Required.
