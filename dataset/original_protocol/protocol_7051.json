    "Configuration of the ViS4MPlace the transparent floor inside the arms at the chosen level and insert the center zone transparent floor at the same level (color mode: upper level; contrast mode: lower level) (Figure 1C).Position the clear plastic covers on top of the arms.Slide the translucent white plates within the brackets below the floors (Figure 1D).Set up the visual stimuli.Color mode only: Install the LED light sources directly on top of the glass base in their respective arm (Figure 1D).Note: The arrangement of the LED chips in combination with the white translucent plates and the clear covers is optimized to allow the light to diffuse equally in all directions and create a spatially homogenous stimulus. No individual LED spots are discernable. Contrast mode only: position the grayscale objects individually, in the middle of their respective arm, on their base, with their opposite side facing at ½ -length (22.5 cm) of the entrance of the arm (Figure 2A-2B).Configuration of the light intensities according to the illumination conditionsPlug the light sources into a power outlet.Turn on the lights using the individual remote controls, then turn off the ambient light of the room.The following steps pertain to the use of a Sekonic Flashmate L-308S light meter to measure incident illuminance (page 19 of operating manual).Attach the Lumidisc accessory to the light meter.Set EV (Exposure Value) mode and ISO 100 on the device.Position the flat surface of the light meter sensor facing and about 2 cm above the floor (mouse eye level) at a locus situated in the middle of the arm.Note: The positioning of the sensor and locus of measurement were chosen for consistency and practicability, assuming the light coming from each LED source diffused in all directions equally into its respective arm. Take the measurement.",
    "Adjust the brightness of the light stimulus using the remote control and take a new measurement, if necessary.Record the EV and proceed to the other three arms following steps 5 through 7.Convert the recorded EV to illuminance units (lux) and luminance units (cd/m2) using the relationships lux = 2.5×2EV and cd/m2 = 2(EV-3), respectively.Note: Illuminance and luminance are photometric measures of perceived brightness of a light source as it relates to the human eye according to the spectral sensitivity function. Although they provide informative characteristics of the light source to the human experimenter, they are irrelevant to the mouse visual system. Radiometric measures of irradiance should be used and can be estimated using the Rodent Toolbox V1 (freely available at https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/stuart-peirson[href=https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/stuart-peirson]).In the Rodent Toolbox V1 (under Toolbox tab), select the type of light source.Enter the details (λ, FWHM) and illuminance (lux) of the light stimulus.Record the estimated irradiance (μW/cm2). Note: In our original Scientific Reports manuscript (Vit et al., 2021), we describe five different conditions of illumination. For the purpose of this protocol, we provide data analysis from two out of these five configurations: Red High (RH) and Equal (E) conditions. Photometric and radiometric characteristics of these two conditions are shown in Table 1.  Table 1.

    "However, we use ANY-maze behavior tracking software to record and save video files of all testing sessions for later analysis. A free version of the software can be used for this purpose. Use the varifocal lens so the entire apparatus fits the image.Adjust the exposure to obtain acceptable contrast of the mouse over the background for trackingNote: A small portion at the end of the arms is significantly darker upon illumination as compared to the middle of the arms. To set the exposure, we use small black objects (remote controls) across the arms to verify contrast is sufficient in the entire apparatus. Re-adjust the exposure in between each condition of illumination.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. A video of a mouse exploring the ViS4M in the color mode. The sequence of colored arm entries and alternations are indicated (speed ×2).Behavioral testing (Video 1)Turn off the ambient light of the room.(Contrast mode only) Turn on dim red-light illumination (mesopic, ~0.1 cd/m2).Note: All testing takes place in the dark during the last third of the light cycle (between 4:00 pm and 8:00 pm). The sole light source is provided by the illuminated arms of the ViS4M. Mice are only tested once a day. Different conditions of testing (in color and contrast mode) are carried out on consecutive days. Bring the mice to the testing room.Leave the animals undisturbed for a short 30-min period of time to habituate to the dark room.At the end of the acclimation period, proceed with the testing of the first mouse.Note: We recommend tail-marking mice the day prior to testing for easy and fast identification. Since the lights of the testing room are turned off, a flashlight can be used if necessary. Start the video recording and present the mouse ID to the camera.",
    "Identify the mouse in its home cage and place it in the center of the maze through the opened top.Cover the opened center of the apparatus with a clear plastic or Plexiglass plate and start the timer.Leave the mouse to freely explore the maze for 5 min.Note: We recommend counting the number of entries during testing. A minimum of eight entries is required to assure an appropriate number of four-arm alternations (see Data analysis for definition of parameters). In contrast mode, the presence of the objects does not prevent the mice from fully exploring the arms of the ViS4M. Most of the mice show no hesitation to jump over the objects to reach the distal part of the arms. After 5 min, return the mouse to its home cage and pause the video recording.Wipe the floors and walls with a solution of 70% isopropyl alcohol, then thoroughly wipe any excess of alcohol with a dry cloth.Note: By the time the next mouse is placed in the apparatus following this procedure (~3 min, steps 6-7), any residual trace of alcohol will have evaporated. Proceed with the next mouse following steps 6 through 10."
