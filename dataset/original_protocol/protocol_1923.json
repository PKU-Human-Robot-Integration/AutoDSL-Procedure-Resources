    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSample preparation\nTiming: 3 h\nThorough preparation of fomites to be tested is essential to rule out misinterpretation of resulting data due to insufficient sterilization and ensure reproducibility.\nAdd 2 mL DMEM complete without FCS to each container (Sarstedt) and store at 4°C until further usage (chose dimension of container to ensure complete coverage of tested fomite with liquid)\nEach replicate requires one container\nSolid fomites, such as stainless-steel carriers or coins, are sterilized in 70% Ethanol for 20 min and aseptically placed in a petri dish for drying\nEach fomite is tested in triplicates\nPorous fomites, such as banknotes or PVC plates, were cut in 2 × 2 cm pieces and placed in a petri dish and UV-irradiated for 20 min from both sides\nEach fomite is tested in triplicates\nCritical: insufficient sterilization of the fomites can cause bacterial or fungal contamination during the experiment.\nPause point: Long-term storage of sterilized fomites under sterile conditions possible at 18°C–25°C. After four weeks we recommend anew sterilization.\nCell culture\nTiming: up to one week (depending on the sample size)\nTarget cells are essential for the determination of residual infectivity after transfer. For SARS-CoV-2, VeroE6 cells are commonly used, but the protocol can be adjusted to respective virus and target cells.\nExpand a sufficient amount of VeroE6 cells\nEach replicate requires half a 96 well plate for titration (sextuplicate)\nSeed cells at 1 × 104 cells in 200 μL DMEM complete per well in a 96 well plate\nIncubate overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2\nVITRO Skin® hydration\nTiming: 18 h\nHydration of the VITRO Skin® is essential for physiological recapitulation of human skin (https://ims-usa.com/vitro-skin-substrates/vitro-skin/[href=https://ims-usa.com/vitro-skin-substrates/vitro-skin/]).\nCut VITRO Skin® into pieces (3 cm × 3 cm) and place on sample holder",
    "Add 15% (w/w) Glycerin in water to a big plastic box and place VITRO Skin® inside\nClose lit and hydrate VITRO Skin® 16–18 h\nNote: Step 6–8 of the step-by-step method details should be carried out at the same day as step 5. Once the VITRO Skin® is hydrated the experiment has to be carried out, as the artificial skin quickly dehydrates again. Thus, the skin should be kept under humid conditions throughout the whole experiment, e.g., by storing in a closed petri dish with a wet tissue inside.\nPreparation of test virus suspension on fomites\nTiming: 20 min\nNine volumes of SARS-CoV-2 are mixed with one-part interfering substance (3 g/L bovine serum albumin [BSA] in 1×PBS; final concentration in assay 0.3 g/L BSA in PBS) according to European Testing guideline (EN 16777, 2019, section 5.2.2.8)\nTests were performed at two different virus concentrations (1 × 104 and 1 × 106 TCID50/mL)\nFive drops of 10 μL test virus suspension are spotted on each fomite (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1519-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. A method to determine transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via artificial skin in a BSL3 laboratory\n(A) Each surface to be investigated is contaminated with 5 drops of 10 μL virus suspension. The virus suspension can either be directly subjected to the following steps or after desiccation.\n(B) Hereafter, the hydrated VITRO Skin® is fixed in the provided gray frame.\n(C) To recover residual infectious virus from the respective fomite, the index finger is put on the unruffled site of the VITRO Skin® and subsequently printed on the fomite for 5 s or rubbed across once.\n(D and E) The VITRO Skin® is then unhinged from the frame, transferred into a container filled with 2 mL DMEM w/o FCS and vortexed for 1 min.",
    "(F) To calculate the amount of infectious virus being recovered, an end-point-dilution assay is performed. Therefore, the medium from the first row of the seeded cells is discarded, 222 μL of the vortexed sample is added to each well and is serially dilute by thorough mixing and subsequently transferring 22 μL into the next row.\nDepending on the scientific question, the contaminated fomites can be dried or used in a wet state before proceeding with the next step.\nNote: Start with those fomites designated for drying the test virus suspension, as this process may take up to 1 h.\nTouch transfer method\nFix the hydrated VITRO Skin® in the provided gray frame (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B)\nRubbing procedure:\nPut the index finger on the unruffled site of the VITRO Skin® and rub once across the fomite applying light pressure (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C)\nProceed with step 13 of the step-by-step method details\nPrint procedure:\nPut the index finger on the unruffled site of the VITRO Skin® and lightly press the finger on the fomite for 5 s (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C)\nProceed with step 13 of the step-by-step method details\nNote: To achieve comparable results, the applied pressure should always be the same.\nUnhinge the VITRO Skin® from the frame and transfer into a container filled with 2 mL DMEM w/o FCS (from step 1 of the step-by-step method details) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D)\nVortex for 1 min (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E)\nDiscard cell culture medium from 6 wells of the first row of cells seeded in step 5 of the step-by-step method details and add 222 μL of the vortexed DMEM containing the VITRO Skin® (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F)\nSerially dilute by thorough mixing and subsequently transferring 22 μL from the first row to the 200 μL in the second row (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F)\nRepeat step 16 six times with subsequent rows",
    "Incubate cells for 72 h at 37°C\nDiscard supernatant and add 200 μL crystal violet to each well\nIncubate 10 min at 18°C–25°C\nDiscard supernatant and eventually wash with 1×PBS\nCalculate residual viral titers (TCID50/mL) (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis])\nNote: All experiments were performed at 18°C ± 1°C–25°C ± 1°C and a relative humidity in the range of 30%–45%.\nCritical: Depending on the research question and to simulate different transmission scenarios, step 11–22 can be carried out with desiccated virus or under wet conditions recapitulating different physical recovery methods of infectious virus. But, desiccation of the virus already leads to a reduction of viral titers. Therefore, high initial titers are required for this experimental setup to receive a sufficient measurement window."
