    "Extraction of metabolites from Arabidopsis thaliana seeds (Figures 1A1-1A8)Weight 20 mg of mature dry Arabidopsis thaliana seeds and place them into 2 ml lock-cap microfuge tubes (Figure 1A1). Seeds were harvested at full maturity at the end of desiccation period. Following collection, the seeds were allowed to fully-dry under vacuum desiccation for another 3 d. Please see Note 1 for seed stock, desiccation processes and replicate recommendations. Insert small metal grinding balls into each tube and place tubes in liquid nitrogen (Figure 1A2).Insert tubes into a 4 °C pre-cooled ball mill plastic adaptors and immediately place the adaptors in the ball mill. Homogenize samples for 4 min at 24 Hz and transfer the samples back into the liquid nitrogen (Figure 1A3).Add 1 ml of 4 °C pre-cooled extraction buffer containing the DL-norleucine internal standard (see Recipes) and vortex vigorously (Figure 1A4). Please see Note 2 for safety recommendations.Centrifuge samples on a 4 °C pre-cooled table-top centrifuge for 10 min at 20,817 x g. This step permits the separation of polar supernatant (methanol/water) and non-polar (chloroform) phases (Figure 1A5). Collect the supernatant into new 2 ml lock-cap microfuge tubes and add 300 μl of HPLC-grade chloroform and 300 μl of HPLC-grade water. Vortex vigorously each sample for 10 sec to allow water and chloroform thoroughly mixed, and centrifuge samples on a 4 °C pre-cooled table-top centrifuge for 10 min at 20,817 x g (Figure 1A6). Collect 300 μl aliquots from the supernatant into new 1.5 ml lock-cap microfuge tubes (Figure 1A7). At this stage, the 300 μl aliquots can be immediately transferred into -80 °C for future analyses without being derivatized (Figure 1A81). In case derivatization takes place, dry 300 μl aliquots using a CentriVap benchtop centrifugal vacuum concentrator for 5-6 h at 25 °C (Figure 1A82). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161030/20161030184433_5415.jpgFigure 1.",
    "Workflow of extraction metabolites from Arabidopsis thaliana seeds Derivatization using methoxyamine hydrochloride and N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltriflouroacetamide (MSTFA) reagents (Figures 2B1-2B5)Methoxymate the dry aliquots by re-suspending the pellet in 40 μl of methoxyamine hydrochloride solution (see Recipe 2) (Figure 2B1). Note: Methoxyamine hydrochloride reagent is extremely toxic, thus, derivatization process must be handled with the highest care under the fume hood. Transfer the whole amount of samples into reaction vials (Figure 2B2). Incubate reaction vials for 2 h at 37 °C in order to protect carbonyl moieties (Figure 2B3). Trimethylsilylate acidic protons by adding 70 μl of N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltriflouroacetamide (MSTFA) containing pre-mixed n-alkanes time standards (see Recipes) and incubate reaction vials for 30 min at 37 °C (Figure 2B4). The addition of n-alkanes allows the determination of retention time indices. Note: MSTFA reagent is extremely toxic, thus, derivatization process must be handled with the highest care under the fume hood.Cool reaction vials in room temperature and transfer the whole amount of samples (approximately 110 μl) into inserts placed in GC-MS running vials (Figure 2B5).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161030/20161030184459_4687.jpgFigure 2. Workflow of derivatization processesGC-MS analysis (Figure 3C)Analyses were carried out on a GC-MS system (Agilent, model: 7890A) coupled with a mass selective detector (Agilent, model: 5975c) and a Gerstel multipurpose sampler MPS2S (Figure 3C). The analysis was performed under the conditions described in Table 1, whereby the DB-5ms capillary column (together with a duraguard, DG) were used to quantify soluble and protein-bound amino acids, and the VF-5ms capillary column was used to quantify sugars, sugar acids, sugar alcohols, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates and organic acids. The VF-5ms capillary column was used as it can reach a higher temperature, thus, allowing better separation of metabolites within chromatographs.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161030/20161030184525_4740.jpgFigure 3.

    "jpgData analysis (Figure 3D)Peak finding, peak integration and retention time correction were performed with the Agilent GC/MSD Productivity ChemStation package (http://www.agilent.com[href=http://www.agilent.com]). The corresponding mass spectra and retention time indices were compared with standard substances and commercially available electron mass spectrum libraries available from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (http://www.nist.gov/[href=http://www.nist.gov/]) and Max Planck Institute for Plant Physiology, Golm, Germany (http://www.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/[href=http://www.mpimp-golm.mpg.de/]). Integrated peaks of mass (m/z) fragments were normalized against the DL-norleucine internal standard signal. The relative peaks of the DL-norleucine internal standard should be of similar height/area among all samples (see representative ion chromatograms appear in Figure 4). Following internal standard normalization, anomalous values were excluded from the metabolite dataset based on the calculated relative peak area of every metabolite. Representative total-ion-chromatograms (TIC) appear in Figure 5 shows differential peak areas from overlaid chromatograms from seeds of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana (Colombia-0) against two transgenic lines.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161027/20161027182825_6466.jpgFigure 4.
