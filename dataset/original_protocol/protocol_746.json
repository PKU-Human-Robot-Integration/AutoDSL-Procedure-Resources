    "1. Transfer 500 µL of biofluid into a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\n  2. Add 2500 µL \\(5x volumes) of QIAzol Lysis Reagent.<sup>1</sup>\n  3.  Vortex 5 sec.\n  4. Optional: Transfer to PLG tubes. You may need to divide a sample into several PLG tubes depending on the volume.<sup>2</sup>\n  5.  Incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\n  6. Add 500 µL chloroform.\n  7.  Shake vigorously for 15 seconds.\n  8.  Incubate for 3 minutes at room temperature.\n  9.  Centrifuge sample for 15 min at 12,000 x g at 4°C.\n  10.  Transfer the upper aqueous phase to a new 15 mL centrifuge tube.<sup>3</sup> Avoid the white interphase. \n  11.  Carefully measure the aqueous phase and add 1.5 x volumes of 100% ethanol.\n  12.  Mix gently and thoroughly. Do not centrifuge and do not delay moving on to the next step.\n  13.  Assemble a MinElute spin column in a new collection tube.\n  14. Load up to 700 µL of the mixture from step 12, including any precipitate that may have formed, onto the column. \n  15. Spin for 15 seconds at 1,000 x g<sup>4</sup> at room temperature.<sup>5</sup> \n  16.  Discard flow-through.\n  17.  Repeat steps 14-16 until entire sample has been loaded.\n  18. Make sure that ethanol has been added to RWT and RPE buffers as instructed in the manufacturer’s manual.\n  19.  Add 700 μL Buffer RWT to the RNeasy MinElute spin column. \n  20.  Centrifuge for 15 seconds at 8000 x g at room temperature to wash the column. \n  21.  Discard the flow-through.\n  22.  Pipet 500 μL Buffer RPE onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column. \n  23.  Centrifuge for 15 seconds at 8000 x g to wash the column. \n  24.  Discard the flow-through.\n  25.  Pipet 500 μL 80% ethanol<sup>6</sup> onto the RNeasy MinElute spin column.",
    "26.  Centrifuge for 2 minutes at ≥ 8000 x g \\(≥10,000 rpm) at room temperature to wash the column. \n  27.  Discard the collection tube with the flow-through.<sup>7</sup>\n  28.  Transfer the RNeasy MinElute spin column into a new 2 mL collection tube \\(supplied). \n  29.  Open the lid of the spin column, and centrifuge at full speed for 5 min to dry the membrane.<sup>8</sup> \n  30.  Discard the collection tube with the flow-through.<sup>9</sup> \n  31.  Transfer the RNeasy MinElute spin column into a new 1.5 mL collection tube \\(supplied). \n  32. Add 14 or 30 μL RNase-free water directly to the center of the spin column membrane.<sup>10</sup> \n  33. Centrifuge for 1 min at full speed to elute the RNA. \\(Optional: Centrifuge for 1 min at 100 x g followed by 1 min at full speed.)"
