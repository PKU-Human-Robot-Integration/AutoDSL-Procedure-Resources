    "Plate 40 μl of the matrigel containing organoids into 1 well each of an 8-well chamber-slide. After letting harden in the incubator for 10-15 min, add 400 μl of media to the well and change at least every two days. If analyzing proliferation by EdU incorporation, add 10 μM EdU to the wells 6 h prior to fixation.   When ready for fixation, remove the media and add 300 μl freshly prepared 4% PFA in PME buffer (room temperature) for 20 min. For this step, and throughout the entire protocol, to change the solution in the well, carefully place a pipette tip into the side of the well and draw up the solution. Then carefully add the new solution down the side of the well. This is performed the same way when changing media (O’Rourke et al., 2016).   Remove the fixative, wash once with IF buffer. Add 300 μl of Permeabilization Solution to the well to permeabilize for 20 min.   Remove the solution, wash once with IF Buffer and then add Blocking Solution for 30 min at room temperature.   Alternative step: To visualize enterocytes by alkaline phosphatase staining, wash the fixed cells twice with TBS and then incubate with 300 μl of the BCIP/NBT Substrate Kit Solution for 15 min in the dark (follow directions that accompany the kit to make the BCIP/NBT solution). The chambers are then washed twice with TBS and then imaged using bright field microscopy. An example is shown in Figure 2.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160214/20160214011430_1110.jpg Figure 2.

Alternative step: Prior to primary antibody incubation, the samples can be processed for EdU visualization via Click-It chemistry using the directions provided with the kit.",
    "At this point follow the Invitrogen Protocol[href=https://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/mp10338.pdf] step 4.3 and finish with 4.7. Then, if required, incubate your sample in 150 μl of primary antibody as in step 7. For an example of an EdU and Keratin 20 stained small intestinal organoid, see Figure 3. Be sure to protect the sample from light from this step forward.    Prepare the primary antibody in blocking solution and add 150 μl to each well. See Notes on Materials for antibodies we have validated. Let the chamber-slide sit overnight in a large, humidified chamber at 4 °C. Do not leave the chamber-slide lid on the chamber-slide as it can cause liquid to be pulled out of the chamber.   After overnight incubation, wash each well 3 times for 5 min each with 300 μl IF buffer. Place the chamber slide on a benchtop orbital shaker set to 60 RPM during each wash.    Prepare secondary antibody in Blocking Solution. For a list of secondary antibodies we have validated, see Note 4. Add 150 μl of the solution to the well and let sit at room temperature for 1 h, being sure to protect from light. Optionally, a phalloidin-conjugated fluorophore can be added to the secondary solution to visualize F-actin polymers.   Optional step: To visualize DNA/nuclei, prepare a solution of DAPI (1 μg/ml) in IF buffer and add 300 μl to each well for 5 min. Then proceed with washing (step 11).    After secondary incubation, wash each well 3 times with 300 μl IF buffer as in step 8.   Remove the IF buffer and detach the chambers using the removal kit that accompanies the chamber slides.    Using a p200 pipette tip with the tip cut off (see Note 6), add a small amount of ProLong Gold antifade mounting medium over each specimen (~20-30 μl each).",
    "Place a cover slip over the specimen, avoiding bubbles. Use clear nail polish to seal the sides of the cover glass to the slide. Let harden overnight at room temperature in the dark. After imaging, the slide can be stored at 4 °C for at least 6 months with minimal loss of fluorescence.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160214/20160214011545_9584.jpg Figure 3.
