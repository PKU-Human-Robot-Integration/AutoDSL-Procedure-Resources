    "The protocol follows the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of Cangzhou Central Hospital (No.: 20210205). Informed consent was obtained from the patients to include them, and the data were generated as part of this study.\n1. Pre-operative preparation\nSelect patients according to the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\t\nFollow the inclusion criteria mentioned below:\n\t\t\nInclude patients with lower waist pain caused by long-term sitting, standing, walking, and waist activities, with or without typical sciatic nerve pain.\nInclude patients with preoperative X-ray, CT, MRI, or other imaging data showing single-segment intervertebral disc herniation or an annulus fibrosus tear, an intervertebral space that does not collapse, and no bony spinal stenosis.\nInclude patients with a physical examination showing obvious neurological dysfunction of the lower limbs and a positive straight leg elevation test.\nInclude patients with ineffective systematic conservative treatment for at least 6 weeks and clinical symptoms seriously affecting their work and life.\nInclude patients with low back pain without lower limb nerve pain. For these patients, perform a selective nerve block by using a mixture of low-concentration lidocaine and triamcinolone acetonide through the intervertebral foramen. This decreases the visual analog scale (VAS) of low back pain by more than 50% within 48 h.\nFollow the exclusion criteria mentioned below:\n\t\t\nExclude patients with lumbar instability or spondylolisthesis.\nExclude patients with lumbar intraspinal tumors or spinal cord tumors.\nExclude patients with ligamentum flavum hypertrophy or contralateral recess stenosis.\nExclude patients with mental disorders.\nExclude patients with coagulation dysfunction.\nExclude patients who are unwilling to undergo surgery.\n\t\t\tâ€‹NOTE: The anesthesia mode was local infiltration anesthesia, and the surgical position was lateral. The procedures were performed on patients in the side-lying position under the guidance of a G-arm or C-arm X-ray machine.\n2. Anesthesia and lesion exposure",
    "Administer local anesthesia to all the patients (15 mL of 2% lidocaine + 10 mL of 1% ropivacaine + 45 mL of 0.9% saline).\n\tNOTE: The anesthesia level is the skin, the superficial subcutaneous fascia, the thoracolumbar fascia, the facet joint, and the surface of the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc.\nUse an 18 G puncture needle to puncture the bottom of the articular process. Ensure that the tip of the puncture needle is located at the inner edge of the articular process in the anteroposterior X-ray and at the center of the intervertebral space or the upper edge of the distal vertebral body in the lateral X-ray.\nPlace a thin guide wire through an 18 G puncture needle, and make a 7 mm skin incision. Place soft tissue expansion catheters with different diameters through the guide wire, and then pace the Tom Shidi locator along the guide wire (Figure 1A).\nFix the tip of the Tom Shidi locator on the tip of the superior articular process, pointed toward the target of the herniated disc, and gently hammer it to make it pass through the articular process bone. Adjust the depth of the Tom Shidi locator entering the spinal canal according to the position of the herniated disc (Figure 1C, D).\nRemove the Tom Shidi locator, replace the guide wire, and use bone drills with different diameters to operate along the guide wire (Figure 1B), which is used to grind off part of the facet joints for intervertebral aminoplasty (Figure 1E, F).\n\tNOTE: The high-intensity zone of the L4/5 segment intervertebral disc annulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus protrusion can be seen in the preoperative lumbar MRI (Figure 2A, B).",
    "After the intervertebral foramen is formed by a bone drill (4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 7 mm, and 8 mm diameter), insert the guide rod along the guide wire. Place the endoscope working channel along the guide rod, and confirm that the working channel has reached the target point by intraoperative fluoroscopy again (Figure 2C, D).\n3. \"Isolation zone\" technique of spinal endoscopy\nPercutaneously and transforaminally place a 7.5 mm diameter spinal endoscope with a 3.7 mm diameter working channel at the lumbar disc herniation at the appropriate level to explore and clean the ligaments and the residual bone fragments in the intervertebral foramen area, the soft tissues in the spinal canal, and the protruding lumbar intervertebral disc.\nRemove the proliferated, inflamed, and red soft tissues scattered in the vertebral canal with microscopic surgical instruments. Use nucleus pulposus forceps to explore the torn area of the annulus fibrosus, and remove the severely degenerated and inelastic tissue.\nRemove the ruptured part of the annulus fibrosus and the protruding nucleus pulposus using miniature surgical forceps. Use flexible bipolar radiofrequency to coagulate the annulus fibrosus and the nucleus pulposus to stop the bleeding and shrink and denervate them.\nWhen there is enough space around the nerve root and the dural sac during the operation, use flexible bipolar radiofrequency to perform an annuloplasty and nucleoplasty on the residual annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus, respectively.\nExplore the nerve root with a miniature probe hook to ensure that it has sufficient space and spontaneous pulsation (Figure 2E). Remove the endoscope and its working channel, and suture the skin with a 4-0 nonabsorbent surgical thread suture.\n4. Intraoperative drug application",
    "During the operation, always use the endoscopic instrument under continuous irrigation with normal saline. According to the condition of the patient, choose appropriate intravenous hemostatic drugs (e.g., preoperative intravenous drip of 1 g of tranexamic acid) or analgesic drugs (e.g., preoperative intravenous drip of 100 mg of flurbiprofen axetil).\nIf the patient is sensitive to pain or has severe nerve stimulation during the operation, ask the anesthesiologist for help with the application of sedative and analgesic drugs during the operation.\nAfter the operation, suture the skin and superficial fascia at the incision of the spinal endoscope without placing a drainage tube. Inject ropivacaine around the incision to relieve pain and discomfort around the incision.\n5. Post-operative care\nProvide postoperative analgesia with oral or intravenous drugs (for example, oral diclofenac sodium sustained-release tablets at 75 mg/day or intravenous flurbiprofen axetil at 100 mg/day) for 3-5 days, neurotrophic drugs (oral mecobalamin tablets, 5 mg each time, three times per day) for 6 weeks, and the appropriate symptomatic treatment.\nOn the first day after the operation, advise the patient to get out of bed and move around while wearing a lumbar orthosis. Under the protection of the lumbar orthosis, advise the patient to exercise their limbs. Instruct the patient to carry out functional exercises of the lumbar back muscles, straight leg lifting (SLR) exercises, and functional exercise plans every day.\nSubscription Required.
