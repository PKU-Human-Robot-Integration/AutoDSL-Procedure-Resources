    "Safety Note: In general, adenoviruses are classified as biosafety level 2 organisms and thus, all manipulations must be done in a Class II biosafety cabinet by a trained person, wearing biohazard protective equipment (including gloves, face-mask for biological aerosols, lab coat, etc.). All solid materials contaminated with the adenovirus must be disinfected with a 10% bleach solution for 30 min and autoclaved for 30 min at 121 °C and 1 bar. Depending on the gene inserted, the adenovirus created may have dangerous potential and may be classified in other biosafety levels.\n1. Experimental preparation\nUse a separate cell culture hood for adenoviral manipulations, and a separate incubator for each adenovirus type.
