    "The use of animals for these studies was conducted using protocols approved by the Johns Hopkins Animal Care and Use Committee, in compliance with ARRIVE guidelines, and were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations.\n1. MULTI-seq\nMedia preparation\nPrepare and equilibrate ovomucoid inhibitor, 10 mg of ovomucoid inhibitor and 10 mg of albumin per mL of Earle's Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS), for 30 min prior to use13. Equilibrate with 95% O2:5% CO2 in an incubator.\n\t\t\nPrepare papain dissociation solution, 20 units/mL papain and 0.005% DNase in EBSS, during this incubation step13.\n\t\t\tNOTE: One vial of DNase solution will be sufficient for 5 samples. Additional vials may need to be reconstituted if performing MULTI-seq on more than 5 samples.\nPrepare lipid modified oligo barcoding solutions.\n\t\t\nMake a unique barcode dilution for each sample by combining 0.5 µL of 100 µM barcode stock solution with 4.5 µL of Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS).\nTo prepare anchor:barcode solution at 1:1 molar ratio, combine 4.4 µL of 10 µM barcode dilution, 0.9 µL of 50 µM anchor solution, and 16.7 µL of PBS and place on ice. The final concentration for both the barcode strands and anchor strands should be 2 µM.\nTo prepare co-anchor solution, combine 0.88 µL of 50 µM co-anchor solution and 21.12 µL of PBS and place on ice. The final concentration of the co-anchor should be 2 µM. Multiply the volumes in this step by 1.1x the number of samples.\nTo make 1% BSA in PBS, dissolve 0.1 g of bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 10 mL of PBS and place on ice.\nTo make PBS with RNase inhibitor, combine 2.5 µL of 40 U/µL RNase inhibitor with 197.5 µL of PBS and store on ice. Multiply the volumes in this step by 1.1x the number of samples.",
    "Sample dissociation\nEuthanize animals through cervical dislocation and/or CO2 asphyxia in accordance with institutional IACUC requirements. Method for euthanasia will depend on institutional requirements and model organism used.\nDissect retina from both eyes in cold PBS under a dissection microscope and transfer to a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube using a transfer pipette.\nTransfer 500 µL of the papain solution to a 1.5 mL tube for each sample.\nPlace samples in the papain solution and immediately cap the tubes.\nIncubate the tubes containing the samples at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 30 min. Invert the vials 3 times every 10 minutes. The samples should progressively dissociate with each round of inversions.\nReturn the vials to room temperature and triturate each sample 3-4 times with a 1 mL pipette set to 300 µL.\nAllow any pieces of undissociated tissue remaining after trituration to settle.\nRemove the cloudy cell suspension while avoiding any pieces of undissociated tissue and place each sample's cell suspension in a new sterile 15 mL screw-capped tube.\nCentrifuge the cell suspensions at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDuring the centrifugation step, prepare the cell resuspension media.\n\t\t\nMix 857 µL of EBSS (Vial 1) with 95 µL of reconstituted albumin-ovomucoid inhibitor solution in a sterile 1.5 mL screw-capped tube.

    "For each sample, add 1.6 mL of ovomucoid inhibitor solution to a new 15 mL sterile screw-capped tube and carefully layer the cell suspension on top. The interface between the two layers of the gradient should be visible but some mixing does not affect results.\nCentrifuge the discontinuous density gradients at 70 x g for 6 min at room temperature. The dissociated cells should pellet at the bottom of the tubes while membrane fragments remain at the interface.\nDiscard the supernatant and add 200 µL of PBS to wash the pelleted cells.

Remove the supernatant and resuspend in 400 µL ice cold 1% BSA in PBS.\nDetermine the concentration of cells for each sample using a hemocytometer.",
    "Determine the total number of cells to load for each sample. Typically, this is the total number of cells desired divided by the number of samples. However, if a biological replicate for one condition was lost, its share can be split amongst the other biological replicates from that condition.\nDivide the number of cells desired for each sample by the cell concentration of that sample calculated in step 3.5 to determine the volume required to load the desired number of cells.\nCombine the volumes calculated in step 3.5.2 from each sample in a new sterile 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.
