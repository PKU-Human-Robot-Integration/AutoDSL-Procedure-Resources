    "Full approvals from the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the University of Tuebingen and the Ethics Committee at the University Hospital Tuebingen were obtained before the commencement of the study. Written informed consent was received from all subjects before their participation.\n1. Patient Recruiting and Preparation\nRecruit a subject, aged more than 18 years, who suffers from lumbar back pain and degenerative disc disease.\nGather all relevant data as back pain related patient history, results from magnetic resonance imaging, current pain medication and history of physiotherapy.\nPerform an orthopedic physical examination to identify the origin of the lumbar back pain looking for tender pressure points, test lateral flexion and trunk inclination and extension, and perform the straight leg raise. For differential diagnosis also test the hip joint for example for flexion, extension and rotation.\nNOTE: 30 subjects and 28 reference subjects were used for the original study.\nRule out that the subject has a neurologic deficit of the lower limbs that requires immediate surgery by physical examination of each of the key muscles.\nNOTE: A deficit in the sensorimotor system of the lower limb of less than grade 3/5 (Janda's classification) should not be included in this study.\nEnsure that the subject presents with normal walking ability and does not show any acute neoplastic or infectious pathology of the spine.\nNOTE: The neoplastic or infectious pathology of the spine will be visible in the magnetic resonance imaging.\nSchedule the subject for spinal surgery.\nAsk all subjects to sign an informed consent for participating in the study.\nSchedule measurement dates for the following experimental setup (see 1.7, 1.8, 1.9., 1.10.) with the subject.\nPerform the first measurement one day prior to surgery.\nPerform the second measurement approximately seven days after surgery, when walking on ward-level is regained.",
    "Schedule and perform the third measurement three-months postoperatively.\nSchedule and perform the fourth measurement one-year postoperatively.\nNOTE: During each examination ask the subject to complete the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) 34 questionnaire and to indicate their usual value on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS) 35.\nPerform the gait and posture analysis with the subject on each visit following the subsequent instructions under section 2 of the protocol.\n2. Experimental Design\nQuestionnaires\nAsk the subject to complete the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) questionnaire and to indicate his or her usual value on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS).\nRasterstereographic analysis\nImplement the measurement setup.\n\t\t\nUse a device based on the principle of optical stereographic measuring that allows the detection of the specific anatomical landmark's vertebra prominens, the two lumbar dimples, and the sacrum point of the rima ani.\nUse an apparatus that estimates spine configuration on the Moiré principle using a projector that projects a grid of light lines on the patient's back and contains a light-optical scanning camera.\n​NOTE: Based on the principles of triangulation, the software analyzes the projected lines and generates a 3-D model of the patients' surface (7,500 points).\nBuild the measurement system with two main modules: the light projector unit that emits the projections of parallel lines and captures the reflections with a camera (15 Hz) and a personal computer with the manufacturer's analysis-software installed.\nAdditionally, hang up a 2.5 m x 2 m piece of plain black cloth or similar that entirely covers the background of the image taken to improve the contrast.",
    "Begin the measurement-process by asking the subject to undress from head down to the waist to expose all four needed anatomical landmarks: the neck with the vertebra prominens, the two lumbar dimples, and the sacrum point as the cranial end of the rima ani.\nMake sure that especially the caudal landmarks are also visible. This may require that the subject opens the trousers and lowers them a little.\nLet the subject stand freely and barefoot in a relaxed standard anatomical position with the feet shoulder-wide apart.\nPosition the subject's front facing towards the wall with the black background while his or her back is targeted to the camera device.\n\t\t\nMeasure the distance from the subject's back surface to the camera device with a measuring tape, as it needs to be at 200 cm during all measurements.\nBegin the measurement by clicking the button for the software's automatic landmark detection on screen while the subject stands freely, barefoot in a relaxed standard anatomical position with the feet shoulder-wide apart.\n\t\t\nIn case of a scanning error manually re-adjust the landmarks position according to the manufacturer's instructions provided with the software, so that they match their actual anatomic position (see step 2.2.2).\nSet the system to a measurement time of 30 s. Due to the 15 Hz rate of the camera device about 450 images will be captured.\nClick Generate on the software panel and wait for the results. The software will calculate the average terminal values needed for further analysis.\nLet the subject rest for 120 s and subsequently step on the treadmill device.\n3. Treadmill Gait Analysis and (Optional) Plantar Pressure Measurements",
    "Use an instrumented treadmill with an integrated system containing capacitive pressure sensors under the belt to register gait parameters such as stride width, step length, stance phase and foot rotation.\nMake sure to use a measuring system that contains of 10,200 miniature 0.85 cm x 0.85 cm capacitive pressure sensors on a mat of 150 cm x 50 cm, registering the exerted force at a rate of 120 Hz and which has a spatial resolution of the mat of 1.4 sensors/cm2.\nAt first, connect the treadmill and video camera to a commercial personal computer using the manufacturer's measurement software.\nAsk the subject to stand on the treadmill barefoot and with the pants rolled up to the knees.\nAttach a safety plug to the subject's shirt.\nNOTE: The safety belt ensures measurement safety by an automatic shutdown of the treadmill, if the subject stumbles or is pushed too far back by the belt. In addition, the treadmill can be shut off via an emergency stop button or a cord.\nUse two lateral rail bars attached to the sides of the treadmill, to prevent the patient from falling off the treadmill in case of stumbling.\nSet the slope of the treadmill at 0% during the entire measurement.\nNOTE: If necessary, the slope of the treadmill used in this study can be adjusted in a range from -2% to +15% in 0.5% increments, to simulate up-hill walking.\nTo register the total load distribution on each foot, ask the subject to stand freely on the treadmill sensors thrice for 10 s. Then calculate the mean value of these three measurements.\nIn the next step, when the treadmill is turned on, ask the subject to walk with normal gait and, as far as possible, not to hold on to the handrails.",
    "NOTE: Walking on the treadmill without holding the handrail is recommended to obtain more dependable results and achieve higher reliability.\nFurthermore, advise the subject to walk between two adhesive tape markers you accurately attached beforehand on the surface of the treadmill to define the limits of the integrated sensor mat.\nAfter starting the treadmill, increase the speed in small increments of 0.1 km/h starting from 0.5 km/h until the subject's individual maximum well tolerable walking speed is reached. Ask the subject during the increase how he or she feels comfortable walking.\nNOTE: The maximum well tolerable walking speed is reached when the subject has reached the highest walking speed with which he or she feels still comfortable walking. The belt speed can be upregulated in 0.1 km/h increments to a maximum speed of 22 km/h which thus even allows running measurements. The minimum speed of the treadmill is 0.5 km/h.\nFor every subject measure two trials with a duration of 20 s. Let the subject rest for 60 s between the trials.\nNOTE: The trial speed is specified by the individual walking speed determined in step 3.10.\nFilm the subject's gait at the same time with a video camera from behind to allow visual correlation between the actual gait profile and the assessed parameters.\nPrint the results displayed as a report through the software's interface at the end of the measurement.\nNOTE: To further quantify foot pressure distribution during gait, the development of a software tool to subdivide the foot into different regions is necessary. For each region of interest pressures are registered from heel strike to toe-off during each gait cycle in N/cm². Eight distinct regions are defined: hindfoot, midfoot, first metatarsal head, second/third metatarsal head, fourth/fifth metatarsal head, hallux, second/third toe and fourth/fifth toe.",
    "4. Experimental Design - Statistical Analysis\nAnalyze the data obtained in step 2.2.8 and 3.13 using commercially available statistical software (Table of Materials). Import the data to the software by clicking Import.\nAssess normality for the data obtained in step 2.2.8 and 3.13 by using histograms, the Shapiro-Wilk or Kolmogorov-Smirnoff test depending on the sample-size, and equality of variances by using the Levene test.\nPresent data as mean (standard deviation) or median (minimum-maximum), depending on normality.\nPresent categorical variables as relative or absolute frequencies.\nFor treadmill variables organize each patient's bilateral data into major and minor values and calculate their absolute differences as a parameter for gait symmetry.\nFor demographic characteristics use the Kruskal-Wallis test, chi-squared test, Friedman test, Wilcoxon test, and Tukey test, depending on normality.\nCalculate correlations between the measurement changes and changes in the patient-reported outcome measures between different time-points using Kendall's tau.\nCalculate NRS values as a percent of the initial value.\n\t\t\nWhen grouping improvement on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS) ordinally, consider >75% an excellent, 30-74% a moderate, and <30% as no improvement.\nNOTE: Since it is impossible to distinguish those patients with actual pain improvement <30% accompanied by also functional improvement from those with improvement just due to a placebo effect (which can reach up to 30% improvement) where we would not expect functional changes, we classified this group for study purposes as \"no improvement\"35,36.\nInterpret the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) according the questionnaire's instructions.",
    "Interpretation of the ODI: For each section, the total possible score is five. After all of the ten sections are completed by the patient, calculate the score as follows. Divide the selected total score by the total possible score (50) multiplied by 100 to obtain the final score in percent. For each section that is missed or not applicable the total score by which to divide is lowered by five. Interpretation of the final score: 0-20%: minimal disability, 21-40%: moderate disability, 41-60%: severe disability, 61-80%: crippled, 81-100%: exaggerating patient or bed-bound"
