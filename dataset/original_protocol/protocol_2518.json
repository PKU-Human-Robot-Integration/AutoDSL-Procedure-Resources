Prepare as many tubes as the number of organisms to be processed.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2150-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Reproducibility of specific activity across replicates\n(A) Schematic timeline showing how the 4 different replicates (Biological 1 & 2, Technical 1 & 2) were produced and workflow of when measurements were taken. Flies were raised at 29°C.\n(B) The graphs compare the level of specific activity (ΔmA562nm/min/mg) between the 4 replicates. Two different muscle-specific GAL4 drivers were used, Mef2-Gal4 (top graphs) (BDSC: 27390) and DJ694 (bottom) (BDSC: 8176), which were crossed with a second chromosome insertion of UAS-lacZ (Bg2) (BDSC: 1776). Measurements were performed on whole third instar larvae (L3) and early pupae (left graphs), and adult male and female thoraces (15d old) (right graphs). Bars represent the average of 5 individuals from a given replicate. Error bars represent ± SD. The data set used for this Figure is provided in Data 2 (Mendeley Data: https://doi.org/10.17632/k2m2m3jgmn.1[href=https://doi.org/10.17632/k2m2m3jgmn.1]).\nNote: Generally, five individuals of a given genotype or treatment are measured per experimental replicate. The variability resulting from pipetting error is negligible (<1.5%), however performing reactions in duplicate or triplicate may be necessary for inexperienced experimentalists, or when using low grade or homemade micropipettes. At least four experimental replicates are measured and presented data represent the average of all individuals across all four replicates (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCollect samples to be measured and deposit one organism into each microcentrifuge tube of Extraction buffer.\nNote: Whole organisms may be used, or specific body parts may be dissected. Here, whole L3 larvae and early pupae were used and adult thorax dissections were performed as follows.\nUse anesthesia to knock out the flies.",
    "Use forceps to grasp the legs and position the fly.\nUse a scalpel to sever the head and abdomen.\nUsing the forceps to deposit one dissected thorax into each microcentrifuge tube of Extraction buffer.\nGrind the tissue.\nUsing a micropestle grind the thorax by hand in the Extraction buffer until it is clearly broken apart.\nNote: Try and be as consistent as possible with grinding the tissue samples. For example, apply the same number of turns (or strokes) of the micropestle. It does not take great effort or time to grind fly samples, and only requires visual inspection to confirm that the sample has been broken apart. Using mechanical homogenizers are not necessary, unless you are working with another organism that has more robust tissue.\nCentrifuge the extracts at 10,000 g for 1 min.\nCritical: Positive and negative controls. It is critical to include a sample that is known to have no activity as a negative control. The residual activity that may be observed in some situations should be subtracted from the activity of the experimental extracts. The detection of significant activity in the negative control would happen if the pH of the Extraction buffer is incorrect (See troubleshooting, problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]). When the bipartite UAS/GAL4 system is used to express lacZ, negative control genotypes are generated in which one component is missing (UAS alone). It is also important to include a positive control sample. In Drosophila there are a multitude of genotypes that are easy to obtain or generate. We routinely use lacZ enhancer trap strains that do not require any crosses, such as arm-lacZ (BDSC: 7370). In other systems one could acquire purified ß-galactosidase preparations, E. coli extracts or saliva.",
    "Note: Cold temperature for extraction is not critical. Both enzyme activity and protein content perdure for hours at 23°C–25°C. Freezing diminishes enzyme activity and protein content declines no matter the temperature after 24 h (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nAlternatives: Since lacZ expression is restricted to the adult muscle in the samples used, thorax dissections were performed in order to enrich extracts and reduce variability caused by the inclusion of non-expressing tissues. Dissection procedures may be altered or omitted depending on specific needs.\nEnzyme measurement\nTiming: 1 h\nFill the microplate and measure using the spectrophotometer with microplate reader.\nSet the microplate reader.\nKinetic measurements (every 30 s, for 30 min) at wavelength 562 nm.\nFor each extract, pipette the volume of extract to be tested (2–10 μL) into a well of a microplate.\nNote: This range of volumes is appropriate for 100 μL Drosophila extracts, but the exact volume may have to be adjusted for samples with very high activity. The extraction volume and the volume to measure will be determined in a pilot experiment when extracts are made from other sources.\nDistribute 100 μL of 1 mM CPRG into each well.\nNote: Since the volume of CPRG is at least ten times the volume of extract, mixing is not strictly required. When the option is available the microplate reader can be configured to shake the microplate to ensure reactions are well combined.\nPlace the microplate in the reader and hit Start.\nAfter the measurements have all been taken, the data can either be exported as a plain text (.txt) format and copied into a desired spreadsheet software and proceed to steps 10 and 11.",
    "Optional: Alternatively, export the data as a plain text (.txt) format and copy the data into the optional LacZ template empty.xls file (Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2150-Mmc1.xls]) and proceed to Optional steps for automated data processing.\nPlot the readings for each extract (Absorbance vs Time).\nCalculate SAV, the enzyme specific activity per volume of extract (ΔA/time/volume). The calculations are done to get the activity in ΔmA/min/mL (change in milli-absorbance per minute per mL of extract). In all below equations units of each variable are indicated in square brackets.\nEvaluate the ‘Absorbance vs Time’ plots. Positive controls should show activity and negative controls should show little or no activity. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] shows an example of an extract with no activity.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2150-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. ß-galactosidase enzymatic activity\nTypical example of activity measurement plotted as absorbance over time from an extract with activity (blue) and with no activity (grey).\nFor all measurements, select points from the ‘Absorbance vs Time plot’ where the curve is linear (close to the start of the reaction). Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] shows an example of selecting points from a plot where curve plateaus. Calculate the enzyme activity (EA) as the change in absorbance per minute (ΔA/min) using the slope between the two points:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2150-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Selecting data points to calculate enzyme activity\nTypical example of activity measurement plotted as absorbance over time from an extract with high activity. Since the plot of the activity is not linear, points are selected near the start of the reaction where the slope is linear (highlighted in red).",
    "E A   [ Δ A / m i n ]  =   A b s o r b a n c e  a t  t i m e  2   [ A ]  − A b s o r b a n c e  a t  t i m e  1   [ A ]    t i m e  2   [  m i n  ]  − t i m e  1   [ m i n ]     \nWe convert the unit of EA from ΔA/min to the change in milli-absorbance per minute (ΔmA/min) by multiplying the EA by 1000. This is optional but is done to avoid working with values with a large number of decimal places.\n  E A   [ Δ m A / m i n ]  = E A  [ Δ A / m i n ]  × 1000  \nCalculate the specific enzyme activity per volume (SAV) in ΔmA/min/mL:\n  S A V   [ Δ m A / m i n / m l ]  =   E A  [ Δ m A / m i n ]    v o l u m e  o f  e x t r a c t  m e a s u r e d   [ m l ]     \nAverage the SAV from the negative controls. This represents the background activity BSAV.\nSubtract the background activity from each experimental measurement to obtain the corrected enzyme activity CSAV.",
    "Note: To ensure that the rate of the reaction is not influenced by the concentration of substrate and instead is only influenced by the concentration of enzyme in the extract, 1 mM CPRG (step 7) is used.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] The reaction is initiated as soon as CPRG is added. For a full microplate one would perform pilot measurements to determine the volume of extract appropriate to set reaction rates tailored to the speed of the experimentalist.\nWhen measuring genotypes where no activity is expected, as in negative controls, it is important to be able to distinguish between a reaction that yields low levels of activity, versus no activity. It is important to take a sufficient number of readings (step 5a) to be sure of the shape of the curve. Especially, at such low levels there can be “noise” or slight fluctuations in the readings that may appear like activity when only looking at very few points. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] demonstrates an example of a reaction with activity versus one without. It is also very important to ensure the selection of the points used in the activity calculations is done accurately (step 11b). With high concentrations of enzyme, it is possible for the reaction to plateau. It would be inappropriate to take the linear regression through the entire curve, as it would underestimate the true level of activity. Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] demonstrates how to select points in a situation where the curve plateaus. It is most accurate to take points as close to the start of the reaction as possible.",
    "Optional: The length of measurement time, and the number of readings taken can be revised for specific needs (step 5a). The volume of extract measured (step 6) can be revised depending on the concentration of samples being measured. The following steps describe how to use the optional Lac template empty.xls file (Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2150-Mmc1.xls]) (step 9):\nThe empty template file and a filled template file with example data are provided in the supplemental information[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2150-Mmc1.xls]. In the provided template, all cells that require information to be filled are highlighted in orange. Enter sample names how they will be loaded in the plate in the ‘Raw data table.’ The number of samples will be calculated automatically and used to automatically calculate the preparations of the Extraction buffer, Substrate, and Bradford dye. All cells with values to be pipetted are highlighted in green.\nEnter the mass of BSA weighed for stock preparation. The volume of solvent to add will be automatically calculated.\nEnter names for the BSA standard curve dilutions and the volume prepared of each. The volumes to pipette will be automatically calculated.\nOnce the CPRG assay has run, export the data in a plain text format (.txt). Copy the absorbance readings into the Raw data table in the template. The data will be plotted automatically in graphs at the bottom of the table.",
    "At the bottom of the Raw data table there are three additional rows ‘Start,’ ‘End,’ and ‘R2.’ These rows are used to determine the appropriate data points which will be used to calculate the slope of the enzyme activity curves. Enter time points in the ‘Start’ and ‘End’ rows. Looking at the graphs should give an idea of where the curves are linear and where they start to plateau. The R2 value (square of Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient) is calculated to test the linearity between the selected ‘Start’ and ‘End’ points. Perfect linearity will give a value of 1. The R2 value will be calculated automatically. Non-adjacent points must be selected to assess linearity with an R2 value. The cut-off value of 0.999 is used. Conditional formatting has been applied to highlight R2 values that are <0.999, which would indicate the slope is changing (plateauing). If the returned R2 value is highlighted, select new time points.\nBelow the Raw data table are the CPRG and Bradford data analysis tables. The activity will automatically be calculated under the ‘ΔmA/min/mL’ heading using the time points selected in the ‘Start’ and ‘End’ rows.\nProtein quantification\nTiming: 1 h\nPerform Bradford assay for quantification of protein content in extracts.\nPrepare a standard curve using BSA.\nPrepare a stock solution of BSA at 2 mg/mL.\nPerform 2-fold serial dilutions to prepare 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 mg/mL BSA solutions that will be used to generate the standard curve. Use Extraction buffer as the 0 mg/mL BSA.\nPrepare the Bradford dye from concentrate (Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate).\nDilute concentrate 5-fold. Prepare 0.2 mL for each concentration in the standard curve, plus each extract to be quantified.",
    "For each extract, pipette the volume of extract to be measured (2–10 μL) into a well of a microplate.\nFor each concentration of the standard curve, pipette 10 μL into a well of a microplate.\nDistribute 200 μL of diluted Bradford dye into each well.\nIncubate at 23°C–25°C for at least 5 min before measuring.\nCritical: Incubation time must not exceed 1 h, as the dye-protein complex will precipitate.\nWhile incubating, set the microplate reader.\nSingle measurement at wavelength 595 nm.\nAfter incubation, place the microplate in the reader and hit Start.\nIf using a preferred spreadsheet software, export the data in a plain text format (.txt) and use steps 20 and 21 to calculate the specific activity.\nOptional: If using the optional LacZ template empty.xls file (Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2150-Mmc1.xls]), export the data in a plain text format (.txt) and proceed to Optional steps below for automated data processing.\nDetermine the protein concentrations of the extracts. The below calculations compute the concentration in mg/mL.\nCorrect the absorbance readings of the Bradford assay. Subtract the absorbance of the 0 mg/mL BSA sample from all measurements. The new values represent the corrected absorbance readings. The 0 mg/mL BSA sample should have an absorbance of 0.\nCreate a plot of the standard curve with the corrected absorbance readings of the BSA samples vs concentration (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/mL).\nFit the corrected absorbances from each of the extracts to the standard curve to determine the concentration (FC).\nObtain the protein concentration (PC) by multiplying with the ratio of BSA sample volume to extract volume:",
    "P C  [ m g / m l ]  = F C  [ m g / m l ]  ×   v o l u m e  o f  B S A  m e a s u r e d   [ m l ]    v o l u m e  o f  e x t r a c t  m e a s u r e d   [ m l ]     \nCalculate the specific activity (ΔmA/min/mg).\n  S p e c i f i c  a c t i v i t y   [ Δ m A / m i n / m g ]  =   C S A V  [ Δ m A / m i n / m l ]    P C   [ m g / m l ]     \nOptional: The volume of extract measured (step 14) can be revised depending on the concentration of samples being measured. All absorbances should plug between experimental points of the standard curve. The following steps describe how to use the optional Lac template empty.xls file (Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2150-Mmc1.xls]) (step 19):\nIn the Bradford data analysis table, the loading order can be entered by filling the sample names in the ‘Sample’ column in correspondence with the ‘Well’ column. The names of the samples in the BSA standard curve should match the names given at the top in the BSA dilutions preparation table.\nOnce the Bradford has run, export the data in a plain text format (.txt). Copy the absorbance readings into the Bradford data analysis table under the heading ‘Unblanked.’",
    "At the very bottom of the Bradford data analysis table is the Standard curve. The template will automatically extract the absorbance readings for the BSA dilutions from the ‘Unblanked’ column based on the assigned names of the BSA dilutions in the ‘Sample’ column. The absorbances for the BSA dilutions will be entered into the Standard Curve table automatically.\nThe ‘Corrected’ column takes into consideration the blank (BSA 0 mg/mL), subtracting this absorbance from the absorbance of every sample.\nA graph of the Standard Curve is produced automatically using the corrected absorbances vs protein concentration.\nIn the ‘Plug to curve’ column of the Bradford analysis table, the corrected absorbances for each sample are plugged into the Standard Curve. The formula will test between which pair of points in the standard does the point plug. Then using the trend function, the concentration is obtained by plugging the absorbance to the equation of the line between said points.\nThe final concentration is given in the ‘mg/mL’ column, where the last step is to take the value that was given by fitting to the curve and adjust based on the ratio of the volume of BSA standard loaded to the volume of sample that is loaded.\nSpecific activity will be automatically calculated (‘ΔmA/min/mg’ column) by looking up the sample by name and dividing the activity in ΔmA/min/mL by the concentration in mg/mL."
