    "The entire experimental workflow described in this protocol is shown in Figure 1. The blue arrow is followed when determining only total FAs, while the green arrows are followed when determining FAs in neutral-lipid and/or phospholipid fractions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200427/20200427193319_1909.jpgFigure 1. Workflow for the quantification of FAs from tissue samples by GC-FID. Frozen tissues are cryogenically pulverized. The pulverized tissue is directly subjected to the derivatization procedure (blue path) when only total FA quantification is required. To quantify FAs in neutral-lipid (NL) and phospholipid (PL) fractions, as well as total lipids (total), the total lipids are extracted from the pulverized tissue using the Bligh-Dyer method, fractionated by solid-phase extraction, and then derivatized (green route).Tissue pulverizationPlace frozen mouse tissue (~50 mg or less) and a stainless-steel crusher into a 2.0-ml pulverizing tube with a stainless steel inner lid, and cool in liquid nitrogen.Shake the tubes using an automatic cryogenic pulverizer (900-1,500 rpm, 20 s). Repeat several times until fully pulverized.If only total FA analysis is required, continue to Procedure D. When phospholipid and neutral lipid fractions also need to be analyzed, continue to Procedure B.Bligh-Dyer total lipid extraction from pulverized tissue (Bligh and Dyer, 1959)Add 800 µl of methanol to the tube containing the pulverized tissue and the crusher.Gently rotate at 4 °C for 1 h.Remove crusher from the tube with forceps.Decant the tube contents into a glass test tube (16 x 125 mm) containing 1 ml of PBS.To recover all tissue, wash the pulverizing tube serially with 1.0 ml of methanol, 1.25 ml of chloroform, and 0.7 ml of methanol into the glass test tube.Note: The glass test tube will contain pulverized tissue, 2.5 ml of methanol, 1.25 ml of chloroform, and 1 ml of PBS. Vortex for 2 min at maximum speed.",
    "Settle the glass test tube at room temperature for 10 min.Add 1.25 ml of chloroform to the glass test tube and vortex for 2 min.Add 1.25 ml of PBS to the glass test tube and vortex for 2 min.Centrifuge the glass test tube at 1,000 x g at room temperature using the swing rotor for 10 min.Transfer the lower (organic) phase to a new glass test tube (16 x 125 mm).For full lipid recovery, add 1.0 ml of chloroform to the remaining aqueous phase, vortex for 2 min, centrifuge for 10 min, collect the lower phase, and combine it with the first extract.Evaporate the glass test tube containing the extracts to dryness using a vacuum evaporator. This step typically takes ~1 h for ~50 mg of tissue from Procedure A, although this depends on the tissue type and evaporator performance.Add 1 ml of chloroform and vortex until the extracts are dissolved.Continue to Procedure C.Preparing neutral-lipid and phospholipid fractions by solid phase extractionRemove a 0.4-ml aliquot from the 1-ml total lipid extract (chloroform solution) prepared in Procedure B and transfer it to a new glass test tube (13 x 100 mm) labeled ‘Total Lipids’. For quantitative accuracy, the pipette should be pre-wetted with chloroform.Pre-equilibrate an InertSep NH2 cartridge (200 mg/3 ml) with 9 ml (3 x 3 ml) of hexane.Place a new glass test tube (16 x 125 mm) labeled ‘Neutral Lipids’ at the bottom of cartridge.Using a pre-wetted pipette, load 0.4 ml from the remaining volume (i.e., ~0.6 ml) of the total lipid extract prepared in Procedure B onto the NH2 cartridge. Collect the flow-through fraction in the ‘Neutral Lipids’ test tube.Elute with 9 ml (3 x 3 ml) of chloroform:2-propanol (2:1) into the ‘Neutral Lipids’ test tube.Remove the ‘Neutral Lipids’ test tube from the cartridge.",
    "Wash the cartridge with 9 ml (3 x 3 ml) of 2% acetic acid in diethyl ether to remove the FFA.Note: Since the eluent often contains interfering materials of plasticware origin that hamper C16:0 and C18:0 FA analyses, we do not recommend using this fraction for FFA determination. Place a new glass test tube (16 x 125 mm) labeled ‘Phospholipids’ at the bottom of the cartridge.Elute with 9 ml (3 x 3 ml) of 2.8% ammonia in methanol into the glass test tube.Remove the glass test tube containing the phospholipids from the cartridge.Retain the ‘Total Lipids’, ‘Neutral Lipids’, and ‘Phospholipids’ test tubes for derivatization.Continue to Procedure E.Extracting and derivatizing total FA from pulverized tissue samplesAdd 500 µl of Methylation Reagent A to the pulverization tube containing freshly pulverized tissue and a crusher.Add 10 µl of a 1-mg/ml C23:0 FA stock solution, using a pre-wetted pipette.Note: This step is critical for quantitative accuracy. Pre-wetting should be carried out until no further liquid drips are observed from the pipette tip. Mix using the rotator for 1 h at 3-6 rpm and 4 °C.Remove the crusher from the tube with forceps.Decant the contents of the tube into a glass test tube (13 x 100 mm).Add 500 µl of Methylation Reagent B and vortex for 5 s.Note: Use test tube caps for vortexing and incubation. Incubate for 1 h in a water bath at 37 °C.Add 500 µl of Methylation Reagent C and vortex for 5 s.Incubate for 20 min in a water bath at 37 °C.Add 1 ml of the Isolation Reagent and vortex for 20 s.Wait until phase separation is complete and then transfer the upper phase to a new glass test tube (13 x 100 mm).Add 1 ml of water to the glass test tube and vortex for 20 s.",
    "Wait until phase separation is complete and then transfer the upper phase to a new glass test tube (13 x 100 mm).Continue to Procedure F.Derivatizing lipids dissolved in organic solventsEvaporate the samples to be derivatized (i.e., total lipids, neutral lipids, and phospholipids, prepared in Procedure C) to dryness using a vacuum evaporator.Add 500 µl of Methylation Reagent A.Add 10 µl of a 1-mg/ml C23:0 FA stock solution, using a pre-wetted pipette.Note: This step is critical for quantitative accuracy. Pre-wetting should be carried out until no further liquid drips are observed from the pipette tip. Vortex for 20 s.Note: Use test tube caps for vortexing and incubation. Add 500 µl of Methylation Reagent B and vortex for 5 s.Incubate for 1 h in a water bath at 37 °C.Add 500 µl of Methylation Reagent C and vortex for 5 s.Incubate for 20 min in a water bath at 37 °C.Add 1 ml of the Isolation Reagent and vortex for 20 s.Wait until phase separation is complete and then transfer the upper phase to a new glass test tube (13 x 100 mm).Add 1 ml of water to the tube and vortex for 20 s.Wait until phase separation is complete and then transfer the upper phase to a new glass test tube (13 x 100 mm).Continue to Procedure F.Purifying FAMEsPrecondition the SPE cartridge column by passing 3 ml of the conditioning solution through it.Load the FAME sample prepared in Procedure D or E (~1 ml) onto the cartridge.Wash with 3 mL of washing solution.Place a glass test tube (13 x 100 mm) at the bottom of cartridge.Elute with 3 mL of the eluting solution.If a low FAME concentration is expected then continue to Procedure G. Otherwise continue to Procedure H.",
    "Concentrating FAMEsEvaporate the FAME solution prepared in Procedure F using a vacuum evaporator. This step will take 10-15 min. Extended evaporation after dryness will lose shorter-chain FAMEs and therefore should be avoided; this is significant for FAMEs shorter than C16.Reconstitute the sample in a small volume (e.g., 20 µl) of dichloromethane and transfer it to the GC vial insert. The volume should be determined so that the GC-FID signals are within the linear range. Since quantification does not depend on the reconstituted volume, the volume can be varied by sample.GC-FID analysisSet the column oven, injector, and detector temperatures to 140 °C, 240 °C, and 250 °C, respectively.Set the helium carrier gas to a linear velocity of 45 cm/s.Analyze the standards (std1 to std4, and the DTA/DPA FAME mix, Recipes 6-10) by injecting a 2-µl volume at a split ratio of 1:25 onto the FAMEWAX column. The oven-temperature program summarized in Table 1 will give good separation (Figure 2).Note: The cis and trans FAME isomers are combined throughout data processing for C18:1n-9 and C18:2n-6 as they are not resolved in this protocol. This is practical for mammalian tissue samples that contain only cis FA isomers. Analyze unknown samples with the same GC method (Figure 3). The split ratio and injection volume can be adjusted according to the sample concentration.Table 1.

GC-FID traces for FAME standards. Overlaid chromatograms for the Supelco 37-component FAME mix (black) and the DTA/DPA FAME mix (pink) are shown. FAMEs longer than C16 can be quantified using this protocol, as the evaporation step (Procedure G) compromises the quantification of shorter-chain FAMEs. *C18:1n-9 and **C18:2n-6 FAMEs are integrated and quantified as sums of cis and trans isomers, as they are not fully separated.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200427/20200427195037_2914.jpgFigure 3.",
    "Typical chromatogram for mouse tissue sample. Total lipids were extracted from ~5 mg of E18.5 mouse small intestine by the Bligh-Dyer method, 40% of which were derivatized to give FAMEs. After reconstituting in 20 µl of dichloromethane, 2 µl was injected onto the GC column at a split ratio of 1:25."
