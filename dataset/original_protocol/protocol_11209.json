    "A list and explanation of some frequently used words throughout the protocol can be found in Supplementary File 1.\n1. Generation of spheroids\nPrepare and autoclave 2% agarose in 1x PBS (e.g., 1 g agarose in 50 mL of 1x PBS) and autoclave 35- and 81-microwell rubber molds.\n\tCAUTION: Avoid using low-melting agarose for generating the agarose casts for IHC processing.\nPrepare agarose casts\n\tNOTE: 35-microwell casts are used for invasion, immunofluorescence (IF) and cell isolation assays. 81-microwell casts are used for cytotoxicity, immunohistochemistry (IHC), cell isolation and RNA extraction assays.\n\t\nAfter the agarose has been autoclaved, let molten agarose cool to about 60‒70 °C. In a cell culture hood, use aseptic technique and pipette 500 µL of molten agarose into an 81-microwell rubber mold per well or 330 µL into a 35-microwell rubber mold per well.\n\t\tCAUTION: Avoid creating bubbles while mixing or pipetting agarose. Remove any bubbles by gently pipetting.\nAfter the agarose is solidified, carefully flex the rubber mold to remove the agarose cast from it. Hereby, place hands above the appropriate well-plate and let the agarose cast drop right into one well of the well-plate.\n\t\tNOTE: Flex the rubber mold at different positions in order to avoid over flexing. It might be helpful to flex the rubber mold and push gently from the bottom at the same time.\nTo equilibrate the agarose casts, add cell culture medium, consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (2.5 mL/well for 12-well plate and 1 mL/well for 24-well plate). Put the well-plate into a cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) and incubate for 1 h.\nMeanwhile, prepare cell culture for seeding.",
    "NOTE: The total cell seeding number per agarose cast is to be decided by the investigator. For murine primary pancreatic cancer cell lines, 35,000 cells/35-microwell cast and 81,000 cells/81-microwell cast (in average 1000 cells/spheroids) are seeded for all following assays. The average diameter of a spheroid is about 150‒200 µm after 48 h.\nRemove cell culture medium surrounding the agarose cast with a P1000 pipette first by tilting the well-plate. Then carefully remove the medium in the seeding chamber.\nCarefully seed the prepared tumor cell suspension drop-wise into the cell seeding chamber. Carefully put the well-plate back into the cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: During this step the cells will settle into the microwells of the agarose cast.\nAdd additional medium to the outside of the agarose cast (2.5 mL/well for 12-well plate and 1 mL/well for 24-well plate).\nPut the well-plate back into the cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 48 h.\n\tNOTE: Usually it takes up to a few hours for the cells to form spheroids in the microwells. In general, solid tumor cell spheroids are formed after 24 h and are stable after 48 h. However, this can vary between different cell lines. If necessary, change cell culture medium by carefully tilting the well-plate with the agarose casts and removing the surrounding cell culture medium with a P1000 pipette. Then carefully add fresh medium by pipetting it along the wall of the well. Usually it is not necessary to change the media within the casts due to its small volume and the risk of removing the spheroids.\n2. Co-culture with T-cells",
    "Resuspend the required number of T-cells in 75 µL (35-microwell cast) or in 190 µL (81-microwell cast) of the appropriate T-cell culture medium (RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin).\nRemove the cell culture medium surrounding the agarose cast with a P1000 pipette first by tilting the well-plate. Then slowly and carefully remove the medium within the cast by gently targeting one corner of the seeding chamber with a P200 pipette while keeping the well-plate tilted with the other hand.\n(Critical step 1) As there is a risk of removing spheroids, control for loss of spheroids by comparing the number of spheroids within the microwells before and after removing the medium by viewing under the microscope at 10x magnification.\nCarefully seed the T-cell suspension drop-wise into the seeding chamber of the agarose cast by holding the P200 pipette about 0.5 cm above the cast.\n(Critical step 2) There is a risk of flushing out the spheroids while adding the T-cells. Therefore, it is critical to add the T-cells very slowly and about 0.5 cm above the seeding chamber.\n\tNOTE: One possibility to decrease the number of flushed out spheroids is by pointing the pipette to one corner of the seeding chamber while adding the T-cells, thus only risking the spheroids in this corner to be flushed out.\nCarefully place the well-plate back into the cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 15 min.\nTake the well-plate out from the incubator and add fresh cell culture medium (RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin) around the agarose cast by slowly pipetting it along the wall of the well.\nPut the well-plate back into the cell culture incubator for 48 h.\n3. Embedding of 3D co-culture into type I collagen matrix",
    "Prepare neutralized type I collagen\n\t\nDilute the stock collagen with serum free base medium (RPMI) to a final working concentration of 3 mg/mL. For every 100 µL of diluted collagen, add 11 µL of 10x PBS and 1.2 µL 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\nKeep on ice and incubate (neutralize) for 1 h.\nRemove the cell culture medium surrounding the agarose cast with a P1000 pipette first by tilting the well-plate. Then, slowly and carefully remove the medium within the cast by gently targeting one corner of the seeding chamber with a P200 pipette while keeping the well-plate tilted with the other hand.\n\tNOTE: Here, it is critical to completely remove the cell culture medium surrounding the agarose cast.\nCarefully pipette the neutralized collagen I mix drop-wise into the seeding chamber of the agarose cast by holding the P200 pipette about 0.5 cm above the cast.\nPut the well-plate immediately into the cell culture incubator for 4 min (35-microwell cast) or 5 min (81-microwell cast).\n\tCAUTION: (Critical step 3) It is critical to strictly keep to the given incubation time. Otherwise, the invasive behavior might not be reproducible.\nInvert the well-plate and leave it flipped in the incubator for 1 h.\n\tNOTE: The casts will stay attached to the bottom of the well-plate due to surface tension. In case special cell culture medium with high serum concentration (e.g., RPMI supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum) is used, an additional washing step with 1x PBS after removing the medium in the well might be necessary to increase surface tension.\nTake the well-plate out from the incubator and invert it back. Add fresh cell culture medium (RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin) around the agarose cast by slowly pipetting it along the wall of the well.",
    "Put the well-plate back into the cell culture incubator for 48 h.\n4. Cytotoxicity assay\nPrepare 3 mL of 1x PBS with 2% fetal bovine serum per agarose cast.\nAfter co-culture for 4 d, remove the cell culture medium surrounding the agarose cast with a P1000 pipette by slightly tilting the well-plate with the other hand.\n\tNOTE: The total time period of co-culture is to be decided by the investigator.\nDistribute 1 mL of 1x PBS + 2% FBS with a P1000 pipette into the seeding chamber to dislodge the spheroids from the microwells.\nRepeat step 4.3 twice with the volume in the well and transfer it into a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 300 x g for 10 s at room temperature (RT).\nCarefully remove the supernatant with a P1000 pipette.\nWash the cells by adding 1 mL of 1x PBS with 2% FBS and centrifuge at 300 x g for 1 min at RT.\nRepeat the washing step (step 4.7).\nRemove the supernatant and add 1 mL of cell dissociation enzymes solution (see Table of Materials).\nUse a P200 pipette and pipette up and down to break the cell clusters.\nIncubate the cells for 20 min in the cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nRepeat step 4.10.\n\tNOTE: Take ~10 µL out and seed on a cell culture dish to observe (under the microscope at 10x magnification) how well the spheroids have dissociated in single cells. If necessary, add 5 min of further incubation.\nAdd 4 mL of full cell culture medium (RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin) and mix by inverting the tube 3‒4 times.\nCentrifuge at 400 x g for 4 min at RT.",
    "Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in FACS buffer for Annexin V staining of apoptotic cells.\n\tNOTE: From here on any FACS staining and cell analysis can be performed.\n5. Hydroxyethyl agarose processing gel embedding for IHC sectioning\nNOTE: Here it is critical to avoid using low-melting agarose for generating the agarose casts.\nAt the end of the co-culture, remove the cell culture medium surrounding the agarose cast with a P1000 pipette first by tilting the well-plate. Then slowly and carefully remove the medium within the cast by gently targeting one corner of the seeding chamber with a P200 pipette while keeping the well-plate tilted with the other hand.\nSlowly pipette 10% formalin first in the seeding chamber by gently targeting one corner of the seeding chamber with a P200 pipette. Then add 10% formalin to the outside of the agarose cast until it is completely covered. Fix the agarose cast in 10% formalin for 1 d.\nRemove the formalin on the next day.\nCarefully pipette 210 µL (81-microwell cast) or 100 µL (35-microwell cast) of pre-warmed and liquefied hydroxyethyl agarose processing gel (see Table of Materials) drop-wise into the seeding chamber of the agarose cast by holding the P200 pipette about 0.5 cm above the cast.\nLet the hydroxyethyl agarose processing gel solidify for 10 min at RT.\nTransfer the agarose cast to 1x PBS.\n\tNOTE: For longer storage, embed the cast in 70% ethanol to prevent contamination.",
    "Dehydrate the gel sections through an ethanol series (1 h each: 70% ethanol, 80% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 100% ethanol [3x changes each]). Then clear in a clearing solution 3x for 1 h each (e.g., aliphatic hydrocarbons [e.g., Clearite], or xylenes), and infiltrate with molten paraffin (3x for 1 h each), either manually or in a tissue processer. Embed the cast in paraffin wax for subsequent sectioning at 5 µm per section.\nRemove wax by putting slides in xylenes, 3x for 3 min each, then rehydrate tissue sections through a graded alcohol series: 100% ethanol for 2 min, 95% ethanol for 1 min, 80% ethanol for 30 s and 70% ethanol for 30 s, then place in water.\nPerform heat induced epitope retrieval in a vegetable steamer at 100 °C for 20 min, followed by 20 min of cooling in a 10 mM sodium citrate pH 6.0 solution and block endogenous peroxidases with H2O2.\nBlock the sections with normal goal serum and expose them to anti-CD8 antibody (dilution 1/25) overnight.\nApply anti-rabbit-HRP conjugated secondary antibodies (see Table of Materials) and develop the staining using 3,3'-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromagen. Counterstain nuclei with an 11% Harris hematoxylin solution (see Table of Materials).\n6. Monitoring and analyzing spheroid invasion in co-culture",
    "NOTE: The time-point of imaging spheroid invasion into the collagen I matrix is to be decided by the investigator. Acquire cell culture images using an inverted microscope with 10x magnification. The ideal time-point is dependent on the cell line being tested, as well as the ECM component. More invasive cell lines will begin to spread into the collagen within a few hours after adding the collagen. Since the T-cells in the co-culture might prevent a full view on the egress from the spheroids at very early time-points, generally images are taken at 0 h (as reference), 24 h and 48 h after adding the collagen.\nQuantitate invasiveness by manually counting the number of “spikes” coming out from the spheroid and/or using image analysis software, e.g., Image J.\n\t\nAnalyze invasion as the number of “spikes” from the spheroid by manually counting the number of “spikes” of a spheroid.\n\t\tNOTE: It is to be decided by the investigator which protrusions from the spheroids are considered as “spikes”. A decision criterion could be the length of the “spike” measured from the edge of the spheroid.\nAnalyze invasion as the invasion area relative to the size of the spheroid.\n\t\t\nUse the Freehand Draw Tool (Image J) to trace the border of the total area (invasion + spheroid area).\nClick Analyze on the top menu, then click Measure to display the area measurement.\nTrace the border of the total spheroid area.\nClick Analyze on the top menu, then click Measure to display the area measurement.\nCopy the measured results list into a spreadsheet and calculate the total invasion/spheroid by using the formula: total invasion = total area/spheroid area.\n7. Immunofluorescence staining\nPrepare the following.\n\t\nPrepare 5.4% formalin (5 mL) using 2.3 mL of 1x PBS and 2.7 mL of 10% formalin.",
    "Prepare 0.5% Octoxynol (50 mL) using 50 mL of 1x PBS and 2.5 mL of 10% Octoxynol (store at RT).\nPrepare IF Buffer (200 mL) using 200 mL of 1x PBS, 200 mg bovine serum albumin (BSA), 4 mL of 10% Octoxynol, 1 mL of 10% polysorbate 20 (warm up to RT before use; filter and store at 4 °C).\nPrepare blocking solution (5 mL) using 5 mL IF Buffer and 500 µL of goat serum (warm up to RT before use).\nKeep 8-well chamber slides, glass coverslips, and mounting media ready.\nDay 0\n\t\nFix the whole agarose cast, including the spheroids, overnight in 5.4% formalin at RT in a humidified chamber.\nDay 1\n\t\nRemove the cell culture medium surrounding the agarose cast with a P1000 pipette by tilting the well-plate.\nTransfer the collagen patch into an 8-well chamber slide by grasping a corner of the collagen matrix within the seeding chamber of the agarose cast with sleek pointed tip tweezers and peel it off the agarose cast in a single, confident movement.\n\t\tNOTE: The collagen patch should be easily separated from the agarose cast. Otherwise, use a P1000 pipette to carefully add culture medium in the area of the seeding chamber or invert the agarose cast and gently shake the well-plate to dislodge the collagen matrix.\nAdd 250 µL of 0.5% Octoxynol (see Table of Materials) per well. Incubate for 1 h at RT.\nAspirate the Octoxynol and add 250 µL of blocking solution per well. Block for 1 h at RT.\nMeanwhile, dilute the primary antibody (dilution for anti-keratin 8: 1/500; Phalloidin 546: 1/200; Hoechst: 1/1000) in the blocking solution, calculating for 250 µL per well.\nAdd the primary antibody in blocking solution and place the chamber slide in a humidified chamber for overnight incubation at RT.",
    "Day 2\n\t\nRemove the primary antibody in blocking solution by aspirating.\nWash 3 times by adding 300 µL of IF Buffer and let it sit for 5 min at RT.\n\t\tNOTE: Just let it sit, there is no need to put it on a shaker.\nDilute the secondary antibody in blocking solution (for anti-keratin 8: anti-rat, dilution 1/500).\nAdd 250 µL of secondary antibody in blocking solution to each well and incubate for 1 h at RT. From here on, protect the samples from light.\nRemove the secondary antibody in blocking solution by aspirating.\nWash 3 times with 300 µL of IF Buffer by adding and let it sit for 5 min at RT.\nRinse the samples with 1x PBS and aspirate it.\nCarefully remove the walls of the chamber slide so that only the glass slide at the bottom remains.\nAdd at least 200 µL of mounting media to a glass coverslip and slowly drop the coverslip over the sample.\n\t\tNOTE: Avoid creating bubbles as this will impact the image quality. Bubbles can be prevented by gently placing the cover slip on the long edge of the slide at a 45° angle or slowly lowering the cover slip on the slide.\nPut the mounted samples in a dark and dry place and let it sit overnight. Imaging can be performed on the following day.\n\t\tNOTE: The coverslip might initially shift a bit once placed over the collagen patch. Let the glass slide sit on an even area for a few minutes. The coverslip will flatten out the sample so that there will be no gap left between the glass slide and coverslip over time.\n8. Isolation of cells from the collagen matrix\nPrepare the following.",
    "Prepare 1 mg/mL collagenase 4 in serum-containing cell culture medium (store aliquoted collagenase 4 dilutions at -20 °C)\nPrepare 2.5% BSA in 1x PBS and coat all tubes and pipette tips with it (filter BSA solution before use).\nPrewarm the BSA solution and cell culture medium before use.\nPrepare 2 mL of collagenase 4 solution (1 mg/mL) to digest a maximum of three collagen matrices from 35-microwell agarose casts.\nTransfer up to three 75 µL collagen matrices from 35-microwell agarose casts into a 2.5% BSA pre-coated 15 mL tube. Grasp a corner of the collagen matrix within the seeding chamber of the agarose cast with sleek pointed tip tweezers and peel it off the agarose cast in a single, confident movement.\nBevel-cut the tip of a P1000 tip with scissors. Pre-coat the remaining tip with 2.5% BSA and break down the collagen matrix as much as possible by pipetting up and down. Incubate the tube for 15 min at 37 °C.\n(Critical step 4) At every 5 min, check whether the collagen matrix has dissolved. Pipette up and down again before taking 10 µL of the sample out and seed it on a cell culture dish for observing under the microscope at 10x magnification. Add another 5 min if necessary.\nFill up the tube with 10 mL of prewarmed cell culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum). Gently mix by inverting the tube 3‒4 times.\nCentrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 4 min at RT.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and leave 2 mL of volume.\n(Critical step 5) Leave 2 mL after the first centrifugation step as there might still be undissolved collagen at the bottom of the tube carrying cells along them.",
    "Perform two washing steps by adding 10 mL of serum-containing cell culture medium each time. Centrifuge each time at 400 x g for 4 min at RT.\nAfter the last washing step, remove as much medium as possible and leave just the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of cell dissociation enzymes solution (see Table of Materials).\nUse a P200 pipette and pipette up and down to break the cell clusters.\nIncubate the cells for 20 min in the cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\nRepeat step 8.13.\n\tNOTE: Take ~10 µL out and seed on a cell culture dish to observe under the microscope at 10x magnification to view how well the spheroids have dissociated into single cells.

From here onwards, FACS staining or cell culture can be performed.\n9. RNA extraction from the collagen matrix\nPrepare guanidinium thiocyanate with phenol (see Table of Materials), 100% chloroform, 70% RNase-free ethanol, RNA extraction kit (see Table of Materials), RNase-free 1.5 mL tubes, RNase-free 15 mL tubes and RNase-free ddH2O.\nTransfer up to twelve 190 µL collagen matrices from 81-microwell agarose casts into a 15 mL tube. Grasp a corner of the collagen matrix within the seeding chamber of the agarose cast with sleek pointed tip tweezers and peel it off the agarose cast in a single, confident movement.\n\tNOTE: The matrices can also be frozen at -80 °C until ready for RNA extraction.\nAdd 1 mL guanidinium thiocyanate with phenol (see Table of Materials) to the collagen matrices in the 15 mL tube.",
    "NOTE: The guanidinium thiocyanate with phenol must completely cover the collagen matrices.\nVortex the tubes for 10‒20 s.\nHomogenize the matrices with 20 G needles and 5 mL syringes until they are completely dissolved.\nLet the matrices sit for 5 min at RT.\nAdd 200 µL of pure chloroform to the matrices and shake the tube vigorously for 15 s.\nImmediately transfer the mix to 1.5 mL tubes.\nLet the mix sit for at least 5 min at RT until the phases are separated.\nCentrifuge the 1.5 mL tubes at 12,000 x g for 15 min at 4 °C.\nFill a new 1.5 mL tube with 500 µL of 70% ethanol.\n\tNOTE: Dependent on the volume of the aqueous phase after centrifugation (see step 9.12. this might not be 500 µL. The amount of 70% ethanol should be equal to the volume of the aqueous phase.\nCarefully transfer the upper aqueous phase of the centrifuged samples to the 70% ethanol-filled tube and mix thoroughly by pipetting up and down.\n(Critical step 6) Be careful not to disturb the layers at the bottom of the guanidinium thiocyanate with phenol separation while removing the upper phase, as this will contaminate the RNA.\nAdd the sample to an RNA extraction column (included in the RNA extraction kit, see Table of Materials). From here on, follow the manufacturer’s protocol for RNA purification from cells.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
