    "All procedures in this study were approved by the New York University School of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) as consistent with the National Institute of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Stereotaxic Cannula Implantation\nUse 10-12 week old male Sprague-Dawley rats.\nAs previously described, anesthetize animals with 1.5-2% isoflurane1,3,5. Once the animal becomes unresponsive to a strong pinch with sharp forceps, perform the surgery. Be sure to autoclave all instruments, use sterile surgical gloves, and add ophthalmic ointment to the animal’s eyes to prevent damage.\nStereotaxically implant bilateral 26-gauge guide cannulas into the PFC at a 12.5 degree angle with coordinates AP: +2.9 mm; ML: +/−1.6 mm; DV: −2.1 mm. In order to insert the cannulas, drill holes in the skull at the desired coordinates, with hole diameter according to the size of the cannulas used.\n\tNOTE: Here, the PFC was studied as the potential target for intracranial implants because of its important role in pain processing, which has been demonstrated in a number of previous studies1,2,7. To study the function of other specific brain areas, researchers can use different coordinates according to the brain atlas. For more details on performing Intracranial surgery please see Goffer et al (2013)3, Lee et al (2015)1, and Sun et al (2017)10.\nAllow rats to recover from surgery for at least 1 week. Following surgery, inject subcutaneous fluids prior to recovery to help support the metabolic requirements, and apply topical bupivacaine in the freshly closed incision. Place the animal on a warm pad until they wake up, and monitor the animal post operation for 3 days to ensure good health and a proper recovery.\nOnce the animals have fully recovered from surgery, begin injections (next step).\n2. Intracranial and Intraperitoneal Injections",
    "For intracranial injections, use PE-50 tubing attached at one end to 10-μL Hamilton syringes with 33-gauge injector cannula that extend 1.0 mm beyond the implanted guides.\nInject 0.5 μL (or less if desired) of either the study drug or saline in the PFC of these rats. Because the PFC is a larger region in rats, this amount will not be spread to other regions. However, for smaller brain regions or for mice, use a smaller volume. The amount injected will depend on the region of the brain and species of animal.\n\tNOTE: Please note that saline should be used as a control instead of DMSO because DMSO is neurotoxic. However, a very small amount of DMSO may be safe for infusion, as studies have shown that less than 50% DMSO (i.e., less than a total volume of 0.3 μL, as in this case) may not interfere with behavior studies8,9.\nInject volume bilaterally over a period of 100 s and keep injector cannulas in place for an additional 60 s prior to removal to allow slow diffusion of this solution.\nFor studies of synergistic pharmacological effects, co-administer another drug through systemic methods. In this case, inject the desired drug or control intracranially and administer an additional drug intraperitoneally immediately thereafter. As an example, in this study we studied the synergistic analgesic effects of morphine and Ampakines to test for an additive effect. We infused an AMPAkine intracranially, in combination with intraperitoneal delivery of 1 mg/kg morphine (a safe systemic dose)10.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended that intracranial injections are done first, as they are more difficult to perform than intraperitoneal injections.\n3. Analgesia Assays and Assessment",
    "To study the effect of intracranial injections on acute pain behavior in rats, use the plantar test (Hargreaves’ tests) to calculate the withdrawal latency in response to thermal stimuli. The Hargreaves’ apparatus focuses an infrared beam through a glass plane onto the rat’s foot; the rat is standing and freely moving above the glass plane. When performing Hargreaves’ test, focus the infrared beam under the plantar area of the rat’s foot.\n\t\nBegin by performing baseline Hargreaves’ tests prior to injections, to establish a baseline value for comparison.\nDo not inject any drug of any kind prior to establishing a baseline value. Conduct 5 good trials, 5 min apart. A good trial is indicated by a clear withdrawal, i.e., when the rat bends its knee and lifts its foot upward and into the body.\n\tNOTE: Make sure the trials are 5 min apart to prevent sensitization of the rat. The Hargreaves’ apparatus automatically records the time of withdrawal, once the infrared beam is broken. As a result, be sure to discount trials from locomotion, shifting weight, etc. If a discounted trial occurs, wait 5 min and repeat the trial.\nCalculate withdrawal thresholds by taking the average of the 5 trials.\nAfter obtaining a baseline average, begin the experiment to get withdrawal times after infusion of drugs. Hargreaves’ tests can be performed 20-30 min after intracranial injections, although the precise timing may be dependent on the pharmacokinetics of the specific agents. This is to ensure that the rat has absorbed the drug and is experiencing its effects. Conduct this experiment in the same manner as step 3.1.\nCalculate withdrawal thresholds as mentioned in step 3.2.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
