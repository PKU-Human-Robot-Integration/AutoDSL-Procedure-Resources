    "1. 3D Mold Design and Parts\nMold\n\t\nBefore working, obtain a silicone elastomer kit, a live cell imaging chamber, a 22 mm glass coverslip, and a machined aluminum metal cube with dimensions 10.07 mm x 3.95 mm x 5.99 mm. Prepare the live cell imaging chamber for molding by placing the coverslip in the bottom holder and assembling the rest of the chamber as directed by the vendor.\nNext, using forceps, place the machined aluminum metal cube in the middle of the live cell imaging chamber housing and on top of the coverslip, and then set aside.\nMix silicone elastomer solutions according to manufacturer’s protocol to make 5 ml of elastomer.\nUsing a disposable lab spatula, pour silicone elastomer solution into live cell imaging chamber setup and ensure not to move placed machined aluminum metal cube. Place the system on the lab bench, in a safe location O/N for curing.\nThe next morning, deconstruct the live cell imaging chamber, as recommended by the manufacturer and pull out mold using forceps. Using forceps, carefully extract the machined aluminum metal cube from mold. Go to the sink and rinse the mold with deionized water. Place the mold on a paper towel to dry.\nOnce dry, using a hobby utility knife, cut slits through the mold, spaced 2.34 mm apart from each longitudinal end, inside the silicone mold. Ensure the mold stays in a safe and dry place until you are ready to construct the system for an experiment.\nHydrophilic and Hydrophobic Glass Coverslips Preparation\n\t\nTo allow the collagen matrix to adhere to a surface, create hydrophilic coverslips:",
    "Using a disposable pipette, measure out 150 µl of 3-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane and pour solution in a 50 ml tube. Add 30 ml of 100% ethanol to the 50 ml tube with a second disposable pipette and close the lid. Vortex the solution for 2 min, ensuring complete mixing. Pour solution in a glass Petri dish and set aside.\nPour 15 ml of 100% ethyl alcohol in a second Petri dish and set aside (make sure to label dishes).\nUsing a new disposable pipette, measure out 30 ml of deionized water and pour solution into a 50 ml tube. Next, using a new disposable pipette measure out 1,875 µl of glutaraldehyde and pour solution into the same 50 ml tube and close the lid. Vortex the solution for 2 min, ensuring complete mixing. Pour mixture into third Petri dish, and set aside.\nUsing forceps, take out one 22 mm round glass coverslip and rinse both sides with 100% ethanol mixture using a disposable pipette.\nPlace rinsed glass coverslip into 3-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane with 30 ml of 100% ethanol solution dish and allow to sit in solution for 5 min.\nWith forceps, take out glass coverslip and rinse again with 100% ethanol solution with disposable pipette.\nDrop rinsed glass coverslip into 1,875 µl of glutaraldehyde and 30 ml of deionized water mixture and set aside for 30 min.\nAfter 30 min, remove glass coverslip with forceps and rinse with deionized water and place onto dry tissue O/N to dry at RT.\nRepeat coverslip dipping and moving for as many coverslips as needed with the same generated solutions.\nMake hydrophobic coverslips by the given protocol.",
    "Add 500 µl of tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl, 100 µl of acetic acid and 19.4 ml of hexane in a 50 ml tube and vortex for 2 min. Pour solution in glass Petri dish and set aside.\nUsing clean forceps, take out one glass coverslip and drop into prepared mixed solution for 2 min. After 2 min have passed, take out glass coverslip with forceps and rinse with deionized water using a disposable pipette and place coverslip onto dry tissue O/N to dry at RT. Store coverslip in plastic Petri dishes until used.\nRepeat coverslip dipping and moving for as many coverslips as needed with the same generated solutions.\n2. Mold Assembly\nBefore using molds, using a disposable pipette rinse the mold with 90% ethyl alcohol over a chemical waste container. Next, place the mold in a Petri dish filled with deionized water and allow to sit O/N.\nTake mold out of solution using forceps and place on a towel to air dry before starting the mold assembly.\nWhile the mold is air-drying, cut the square hydrophilic coverslips into two rectangles slightly larger than 3.95 mm x 5.99 mm using a high-precision diamond-scribing tool. Slide each cut rectangle coverslip into the slots cut into the silicone mold.\nFlip the mold upside down and apply vacuum grease along the bottom of the silicone mold using a disposable pipette. Next, flip the mold back right-side up and press the bottom of the mold onto the circular hydrophilic glass coverslip to create a seal.\nWith disposable gloves, pick up the assembled mold and place into a disposable Petri dish and then into a bio-hood. Turn on UV Bio-hood lamp for 1 hr to sterilize the mold before experimentation occurs.\n3. Collagen Mixture and 3D Matrix",
    "Before preparing the collagen mixture, stain and prepare cells for imaging according to standard protocols28.\nUsing standard laboratory techniques and protocols29,30, in a bio-hood, mix cell media and chemoattractant in a 15 ml tube to desired chemoattractant concentration. Pipette 5 ml of specific cell media-chemoattractant concentration solution into a 15 ml tube and move the solution into a heated water bath.\nUsing a pipette, extract 5 ml of just cell media into a second 15 ml tube and place in a heated water bath to heat up the solution for microscopy experiments.\nIn a bio-hood, pipette 30 µl of 10x phosphate buffered solution (PBS) into micro centrifuge tube. Add 6 µl of 1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) into same micro centrifuge tube and vortex for 15 sec.\nObtain collagen I rat tail solution from the fridge and move to the bio-hood using standard laboratory techniques and protocols29. Ensure the collagen is still cold. Pipette 168.3 µl of collagen into same micro centrifuge tube.\nNext, add 18 µl of yellow-green fluorescent carboxylate-modified microspheres using a pipette to the same micro centrifuge tube. Vortex the micro centrifuge tube with all the solutions for 30 sec.\nAdd 77.7 µl of desired cell media-cell mixture (approximately 2 x 106 cells/ml concentration) into micro centrifuge tube and mix using pipette tip for 20 sec. As necessary, alter the matrix density by following the custom collagen mixture adapted for the addition of fluorescent beads and cell viability table (Table 1).\nPipette 300 µl of collagen-cell mixture into the center well (well #2) of the prepared mold assembly. Place the mold onto a disposable Petri dish and move it into a standard incubator for 20 min at 37 °C with 5% CO2.",
    "Remove system from incubator and place back into bio-hood. Using forceps, remove both hydrophobic cover slips by clamping onto the top of each coverslip and pulling up and away from the mold.\nMove the whole system to the desired microscopy and image to ensure collagen mold sides are still straight to allow for a planar diffusion gradient.\nWith the system still under the microscope, using a 100 µl single-channel pipette, add 100 µl of cell media into well #1. Next, using a 100 µl single-channel pipette add 100 µl of cell media with desired chemoattractant concentration into well #3.\nImmediately after adding solutions into both wells, commence imaging.\n4. Imaging and Diffusion Modeling\nIf one wants to find the diffusion coefficient for the specific collagen density to calculate the specific concentration, follow the protocol below:\n\t\nFollow the given protocol above titled “Collagen Mixture and 3D Matrix,” instead of generating cell media with desired chemoattractant concentration, make 5 µM rhodamine in a 15 ml tube using standard calculations and protocols30.\nImage the 3D collagen matrices with a confocal system mounted on an inverted microscope using an argon laser (488 nm) to capture the fluorescence. Image every 2 or 3 sec for up to 7 hr.\nFor Diffusion Modeling: Using the mathematical model shown below, write a computational software code for processing and analysis with these general steps.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52948/52948eq1.jpg\nImport images into computational software for rescaling and normalizing by the maximum intensity. Convert images to a gray color-map of the image to select the edge. Pick an axis along the center of the image, to the right of the center and to the left of the center.\nUsing the computational software code, plot the normalized intensity, along with the true intensity and the difference between the two.",
    "Next, input the parameters necessary for fitting (concentration, time, and length).\nPlot the normalized concentration versus time and the concentration profile across the x-axis with a polynomial fit to the data.\nCalculate the coefficient of diffusion using the computational software code.\n5. Experimental Measurements\nReferring back to the diffusion equation, rewrite the equation to find the specific concentration at any location within the system as shown in below.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52948/52948eq2.jpg\n\tWhere:\n\tL = Length of the collagen matrix\n\tx = location under investigation\n\tD = coefficient of diffusion\n\tt = elapsed time\nDuring chemotaxis experiments, ensure to record the specific time that the moment chemokine was added to system. Once cell migration movement is found, ensure to record confocal time-lapse recording, and note the specific time and location from edge where imaging occurred.\nDuring data analysis, plug the noted elapsed time, location and coefficient of diffusion for the specific cell into the equation to find the normalized specific concentration at any point within the collagen for both diffusion and cell experiments.\n6. Tracking Cell Migration Utilizing TFM\nTo track cell migration using TFM/DVC techniques follow the protocol below:\n\t\nAfter the addition of desired chemoattractant concentration into well #3, start imaging the 3D collagen matrices with a confocal system mounted on an inverted microscope to find a cell to investigate.\nOnce a moving cell is found, place the cell in the middle of the field of view and utilize a piezoelectric motor (to image in the z-axis), image every 1 or 2 min.\nFor calculating cell force generation and deformation, generate a computational code to find the displacements of the fluorescence beads following the TFM/DVC protocols31.\nSubscription Required.
