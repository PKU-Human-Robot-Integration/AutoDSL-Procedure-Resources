    "All experimental procedures were approved by Deakin University Animal Ethics Committee (Project #G19/2014).\n1. Equipment Setup\nEnsure that all machines are properly connected.\nTurn on the computer, the high-power bi-phase stimulator, and dual-mode lever system.\nSet up the mouse knee clamp on the platform, as well as the mouse footplate on the transductor.\nTurn on the heating platform to 37 °C.\nOpen the dynamic muscle control software on the desktop.\nNOTE: This is the software needed to perform functional testing.\n2. Software and Model Setup\nOnce the program is opened (Figure 1), calibrate the transducer and select Setup | My Instruments | Calibrate.\nOn the \"Setup\" button, select InstantStim and change the \"Run Time\" parameters to 120 s (Figure 1A).\nNOTE: Optimal voltage can also be achieved by performing single twitches, manually setting up, or starting the InstantStim as many times as needed.\nIn the type-able window labeled \"Autosave Base\" to input the name of the auto save file location (e.g., mouse1-date-timepoint1). Click the checkbox to the left of the \"Autosave Base\" window and change it to Enable Autosave.\nAt the top of the DMC control screen go to Sequencer, which will open a new pop up window. Select Open Sequence and select the premade protocol to be used (Figure 1B). Click Load Sequence | Close Window.\nNOTE: This step is used to generate a force frequency-curve (FFC) test (1, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100, 150, 200, 250 Hz).\nSet the \"RANGE\" knob to 10 mA on the bi-phase stimulator.\nNOTE: Ensure that the \"ADJUST\" knob (right next bottom) is on zero. This fine adjustment allows the setup of the electrodes.\n3. Mouse Setup\nNOTE: All force measurements were performed on male wild-type mice (C57BI/6) at 12 weeks of age.",
    "Place each mouse into the anesthesia chamber with an oxygen flow rate of 1 L/min with 5% isoflurane (via nosecone inhalation) until the mouse loses consciousness. Confirm adequate anesthesia via loss of the foot reflex.\nRemove all hair on the right leg of the mouse by shaving with electric hair clippers.\nPlace the animal in a supine position on the heated platform and clean the right leg (either side can be used) with 70% alcohol and iodine. At this point, adjust the isoflurane to 2% (with oxygen flow at 1 L/min) and apply the conductive gel to the skin where electrodes will be placed.\nNOTE: Use a rectal temperature probe to monitor the body temperature during the procedure and apply eye ointment to prevent any dryness and/or damage to the eye.\nPlace the foot onto the footplate and attach using medical tape. Clamp the knee to stabilize and immobilize the leg during the procedure.\nNOTE: Some studies have described using a very thin pin inserted through the proximal tibia (posterior to the dorsiflexors muscles)12 to provide stabilization. This protocol opts for a clamp, as this provides sufficient stabilization without unnecessary compression/damage to the knee. The clamp also avoids potential inflammation that a trans-osseous pin might create, while still allowing accurate assessment of muscle contractility. Furthermore, the mouse knee clamp has been successfully used14.\nAt this point, use the knobs on the platform to position the mouse hindlimb so that there is a 90° angle at the ankle (Figure 2).\n4. Optimization of the Electrodes Position\nOnce the mouse is placed on the platform, position the electrodes under the skin (subcutaneous) in the right leg.\nNOTE: This is a crucial step, and some repositioning may be required to get the desired position during the setup in step 4.4.",
    "Place the electrodes on the lateral side of the right leg; place one near the head of the fibula and the other electrode more distally on the lateral side of the leg (Figure 2).\nNOTE: A custom-made electrode system is designed to optimize this step. However, this test can be performed with electrode needles provided by the manufacturer in this system.\nOnce these steps are achieved, on the high-power bi-phase stimulator adjust the knob labeled \"ADJUST\" as needed to obtain a stimulation of the peroneal nerve that results in maximum dorsiflexion torque.\nNOTE: For adult wild-type mice, this range is less than 2 mA; however, this may be dependent on the size, age, and sex of the animal. The force production (peaks of curves) should be increased slowly until the maximum force is reached.\nDuring stimulation, turn the transducer clockwise to yield negative values (Figure 3), which are important to ensure that the electrodes are stimulating only the dorsiflexor muscles by peroneal nerve. Once this step is achieved, stabilize the electrodes using a clamp, preventing any movement during the procedure.\nNOTE: The peaks will slowly increase in magnitude, and the maximum amperage is determined as the level at which three or more consecutive stimulations result in identical contractility. Resist turning the amperage higher than necessary; the maximum amperage will stimulate the neighboring and potentially antagonist muscles to contract, causing co-contraction, which can generate peaks of positive values.\nStop the Instant Stim on the software.\nOn the main screen, turn on the button labeled \"Start Sequence\" to start the previous setup sequence (as described in step 2.4).\n5. Ending the Procedure\nOnce the force measurements are finished, remove the electrodes, release the knee clamp, and remove the foot tape.",
    "Turn off the isoflurane and maintain oxygen delivery for a few minutes aiding the animal recovery. Once the mouse starts moving and/or regains consciousness and can self-right, return the mouse to its cage.\nNOTE: A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) can be injected subcutaneously (1 mg/kg meloxicam) to prevent any discomfort and/or soreness after the procedure.\n6. Data Analysis\nOpen the data analysis software.\nGo to High Throughput (top-left on the screen). Select Force Frequency to analyze the above described setup sequence.\nSelect Manual and change the \"End Cursor\" value to 3. Also select Remove Baseline.\nClick on Pick Files to access the previously performed procedure and then click Analyze. At this point the result can be accessed on the screen or exported to a spreadsheet for further analysis and/or calculations.\nNOTE: The data were measured in mN; however, the torque can be calculated by multiplying the force value by the length of the lever arm (absolute force). If normalization is required (specific force), torque can be normalized to body weight, or terminal experiments can be performed to collect muscle mass of age-matched."
