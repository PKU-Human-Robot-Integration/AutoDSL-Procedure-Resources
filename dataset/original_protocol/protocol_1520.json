Sample preparation\n(A) A metal slide with a round opening used for sample mounting.\n(B) Vacuum grease is applied with a toothpick in two thin lines on each side of the round opening of the metal slide. Note that the metal slide is positioned on a stand to prevent contact with the surface.\n(C) A rectangular coverslip is placed above the opening and pressed firmly to the metal slide on the sides.\n(D) The metal slide is flipped over and a small amount of water or media is added to the coverslip.\n(E) One to three etiolated seedlings are carefully transferred to the water/media droplets and placed in the middle of the coverslip.\n(F) Preparation of an agarose pad. LEFT: Melted 0.8% agarose is added to a round coverslip. MIDDLE: A second round coverslip is carefully placed on top of the agarose. RIGHT: Prepared agarose pads are stored in a petri dish on parafilm.\n(G) The upper round coverslip is removed from the agarose pad and the agarose pad with the attached round coverslip is carefully placed on top of the seedlings at an angle to avoid air bubbles. Excess water/media is absorbed by cautiously placing a corner of a tissue close to the agarose pad edge.\n(H) The prepared sample is ready to be imaged.\n(I) A thin layer of immersion oil is added to the 100x objective and the metal slide with the prepared sample is placed on top with the rectangular coverslip touching the oil.",
    "Attach a 22x32 mm coverslip on one side of the metal slide by adding a small amount of silicone vacuum grease on each side of the metal slide opening and pressing the coverslip firmly onto the slide without touching the center of the coverslip (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C).\nFlip the metal slide over, so the coverslip is below the metal slide, and place it on a stand, such that the coverslip is not touching any surface (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nMount the etiolated seedling on the prepared metal slide and coverslip.\nAdd a minimal amount (∼10 μL) of sterile water or sterile liquid ½ MS medium in the middle of the coverslip without touching the glass (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nCarefully lift an etiolated seedling from the plate using a toothpick or fine forceps and transfer it to the coverslip. Place a total of one to three hypocotyls centered in the middle of the slide (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nCover the etiolated seedling with an agarose pad.\nTake the prepared round coverslips with agarose in the middle (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F) and separate the upper coverslip from the lower one; the agarose pad will remain attached to one of the round coverslips (like separating the cream filling from a popular type of chocolate sandwich cookie); discard the round coverslip without the agarose.\nCarefully place the agarose and coverslip, agarose side down, on top of the seedlings without moving or pressing the seedlings. The agarose pad will create a more stable environment for time-lapse imaging.\nAbsorb the excess water or media with a tissue to reduce seedling drift or movement during imaging (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G and 2H).",
    "Critical: Be very careful not to disturb the seedling, as the cells will be damaged if pressure is applied. Stressing the seedling can also inhibit cytoplasmic streaming and movement of Golgi stacks and other organelles in the cytosol. The mounting phase should be done as quickly as possible to minimize hypocotyl exposure to light. It is also important that no air bubbles are introduced under the agarose pad during mounting.\nCSC imaging with the spinning disk microscope\nTiming: depending on the experiment; 1 sample approximately 12 min\nEtiolated hypocotyl epidermal cells of the seedlings are imaged using an inverted spinning disk confocal microscope (e.g., Nikon Eclipse Ti2-E with a CSU-W1 spinning disk head), a sCMOS camera (e.g., Photometrics Prime95B), and a 100 × oil-immersion objective (e.g., Nikon APOTIRF, MRD01991, NA 1.49, WD 0.12). Depending on the fluorophore attached to the CESA protein, use an excitation wavelength of 488 nm for GFP, 515 nm for YPF or 561 nm for RFP/tdTomato, and band emission filter 525/36 nm for GFP, 540/24 nm for YFP or 605/52 nm for RFP/tdTomato, or other appropriate excitation and emission parameters for the fluorophore.\nPut a drop of immersion oil on the objective and transfer the slide with the rectangular coverslip facing the microscope objective (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nUsing a low laser power (∼15% of 60 mW laser, power measured at fiber tip) and short exposure times (100–200 ms) to prevent photo-bleaching, find cells approximately 2 cells below the apical hook.\nNote: Higher laser powers and longer exposure times increase the signal to noise ratio, but also increase photo-bleaching.",
    "Move to the plasma membrane focal plane, where there are active CSCs . Identify the plasma membrane focal plane by moving in towards the surface of the cell – the CSCs are small punctae, which will appear as clear and bright fluorescent signal. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]. Avoid stressed or dead cells and cells with no fluorescent signal. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nFor time-lapse movies, activate the focus maintenance system (i.e., ‘Perfect Focus System’ for Nikon microscopes), then re-adjust the focus if necessary.\nNote: The focus maintenance system stabilizes the selected focal plane and therefore reduces drift in the Z direction (‘Z-drift’). To minimize sample drift, water or media should be minimized when preparing the sample.\nTake a 10-min movie with 10 s time intervals with the exposure time of 300–800 ms, depending on the fluorescent marker (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nNote: It is very important that the imaging is performed in a temperature-stable environment as CESA movement/activity can vary in different temperatures (Fujita et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). The laser can increase sample temperature, it is therefore important to keep the imaging times to a minimum to avoid artefacts.\nDrift in the XY- and/or Z-direction is either caused by movement of the sample or extensive thermal drift. Significant drift can already be identified during live-cell imaging. In case of extensive drift, stop the acquisition and repeat the imaging with a new sample. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9] and 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11]\nOptional: Short-term inhibitor (e.g., isoxaben) treatment is possible before the sample preparation and imaging steps. For this, seedlings can be transferred to liquid ½ MS media with 1% sucrose (e.g., in a 6-well plate) with the appropriate inhibitor concentration and imaged immediately after the treatment.\nImage processing with Fiji\nTiming: 1 sample approximately 5 min, batch processing is also possible in Fiji",
    "XY- and Z-drift can be easily detected by playing the movie or by generating a sum intensity projection of all images.\nOpen the image stack in Fiji (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A; Data S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1060-Mmc2.zip]) and click on the ‘Play’ button to check for large abnormalities.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1060-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Visualization of cellulose synthase complexes (CSCs) by live-cell imaging\n(A) Image of fluorescently-tagged CESAs in a hypocotyl cell at the plasma membrane focal plane. The insert is a close-up of the area inside the dashed rectangle and shows an example of an out-of-focus Golgi stack (white arrow), a SmaCC particle (yellow arrow) and several CSCs in a line (magenta arrow). Scale bar in the insert: 5 μm.\n(B) A sum intensity projection of (A). CSCs can be visualized over a time span of 5–10 min as linear tracks at the plasma membrane.\nScale bars: 20 μm. See also Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3].\nTo generate the summed intensity image, go to ‘Image -> Stacks -> Z Project…’ and select all images and ‘Sum Slices’. Press OK. The output will be the movement of CESAs in the plasma membrane (and CESAs in Golgi stacks and other small intracellular compartments) over the time span of the imaging. Active CSCs should be observed as distinct linear tracks (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nIf XY-drift occurred, the image stack can be processed with the StackReg plugin in Fiji (Thévenaz et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nGo to ‘Plugins -> StackReg’ and select the ‘Rigid Body’ transformation correct for XY-drift; ‘Rigid Body’ allows for corrections of X- and Y- translations, as well as rotation, but will not resize the images (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1060-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. XY-drift correction of CSC time-lapse images using the StackReg plugin",
    "(A–D) Time course at 0 (A), 1 (B), 2 (C) and 3 min (D) of imaging shows a slight XY-drift towards the upper right of the image.\n(E) Sum intensity projection before applying StackReg for drift correction on a movie with XY-drift shows blurred CSC tracks.\n(F–I) Time course at 0 (F), 1 (G), 2 (H) and 3 min (I) of the same movie as in (A–D) after XY-drift correction with StackReg.\n(J) Sum intensity projection after running StackReg to correct for XY-drift shows successfully aligned images and clear CSC tracks.\nScale bars: 20 μm.\nAlternatively, the preinstalled Fiji plugin under ‘Plugins -> Registration -> Rigid Registration’ can be used to correct for XY-drift.\nAdditional processing on the TIFF stack prior generating the image projection might be required to reduce background noise and enhance the signal intensity.\nFor background noise reduction select ‘Analyze -> Multi Kymograph -> Walking Average’ (3 frame average).\nFor the signal intensity enhancement select ‘Process -> Enhance contrast…’; the saturated pixels value should be around 0.4% and ‘Process all X slices’ should be selected to process all images in the stack.\nFor background subtraction, use ‘Process -> Subtract Background’ with a rolling ball radius of ∼50 px.\nNote: Selecting a bright and stable fluorophore with a high quantum yield and low photo-bleaching rate can reduce the need for image processing before the analysis.\nNote: Laser power and exposure times should be optimized during live-cell imaging to yield images with high signal-to-noise ratio while reducing photo-bleaching and photo-damage.\nAdjusted stacks can be saved in the TIFF format and used for analysis.\nNote: All images should be processed in an identical manner.",
    "Note: Other analysis pipelines are also suitable, including using proprietary software such as IMARIS (Gutierrez et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Vellosillo et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]) or open-source software, such as ICY (Woodley et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).\nCritical: Any image adjustments, including the algorithms and parameters used, should be reported in image analysis methods."
