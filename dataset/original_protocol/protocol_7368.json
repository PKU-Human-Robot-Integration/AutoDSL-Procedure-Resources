  "procedures": [
    "Plasmid construction and plant transformation  Select root cell type-specific promoters [Endodermis 7 (EN7) for endodermis and  Acaulis5 (ACL5) for metaxylem/procambium were used in this study] and amplify them from  Arabidopsis  genomic DNA.Amplify the GFP-coding sequence from pMDC107 plasmid and the  AGO1  genomic sequence containing the coding region and 3’ UTR from  Arabidopsis  genomic DNA using PCR (Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase). Assemble them with a root cell layer-specific promoter into pCambia1300 using In-Fusion HD cloning plus, according to the manual of the kit. A linker sequence of five amino acids (GGGGA) was inserted between  GFP  and  AGO1  . The recombinant constructs were transformed into  E. coli  DH5α competent cell for verification (Renzette, 2011).The constructs were transformed into  Agrobacterium tumefaciens  GV3101 by electroporation. Transgenic lines were generated by  A. tumefaciens  -mediated ﬂoral dip transformation (Clough and Bent, 1998).Homozygous single insert transformants were selected by growing the transgenic lines on ½ MS (Half strength Murashige and Skoog Medium) containing antibiotics and used for the subsequent experiment. Plant material preparation and collection  Measure 200 µL of transgenic seeds and sterilize with seed sterilization solution for 10 min by gently rotating at 18 rpm on a H5600 revolver tube mixer.Briefly spin at 2,000  × g  for 20 s to pellet the seeds and discard the bleach solution.Resuspend the seeds with sterile water and gently rotate at 18 rpm for 1 min on a H5600 revolver tube mixer to wash the seeds. Repeat five times.Cut the nylon mesh into 9 × 9 cm squares to fit inside 150 mm Petri dishes. Autoclave them for 20 min.Transfer the nylon mesh onto the top of ½ MS Petri dishes in the sterile hood.Sow 500 seeds per Petri dish in a line on top of the nylon mesh.",
    "Grow the plants vertically at 16 h light and 8 h dark and 22 °C for nine days. Note: 200 μL transgenic seeds can be sowed into 10 plates and produce 2–3 g root tissues.  Harvest the roots by cutting them off with a blade at approximately 2 cm above the root tip. Note: Change the blade regularly to avoid damaging the roots when slicing.   GFP-AGO1 immunoprecipitation  Grind 2 g of root tissue into fine powder in liquid nitrogen and add 4 mL of freshly prepared IP lysis buffer.Incubate at 4 °C with gentle rotation at 18 rpm for 30 min.Centrifuge at 16,000  × g  for 20 min at 4 °C to remove the insoluble debris and repeat this step one more time.Transfer 100 µL of supernatant to a new tube. Add 100 µL of 2× protein SDS loading buffer and heat at 95 °C for 5 min. Store the sample at -20 °C for western blotting.Prewash 50 µL of GFP-Trap magnetic agarose beads with 1 mL of IP lysis buffer. Separate the beads with a magnetic stand and discard the supernatant. Repeat this step two more times.Transfer the remaining supernatant from step C3 into a new tube and add the prewashed GFP-trap magnetic agarose beads.Incubate on a rotator at 4 °C for 2 h.Remove the supernatant by placing the tube on a magnetic stand. Wash the beads with 1 mL of washing buffer by rotating the tube at 4 °C for 5 min. Use the magnetic stand to separate the beads from the supernatant and discard the supernatant. Repeat this step four more times.Resuspend the beads in 200 µL of washing buffer and transfer 20 µL (10% of the sample) into a new tube for western blot analysis.",
    "The remainder of the sample should be kept for RNA extraction and is referred to as the RNA sample.Use a magnetic stand to separate the beads from the supernatant in the western blot sample and discard the supernatant. Resuspend the beads with 20 µL of 1× SDS loading buffer and heat the sample at 95 °C for 5 min. Separate the beads from the supernatant using the magnetic stand and transfer the supernatant to a new tube for western blot analysis.Separate the beads from the supernatant in the RNA sample using the magnetic stand and discard the supernatant.Add 500 µL of TRI reagent to the beads to resuspend the beads.Add 100 µL of chloroform to the tube, shake vigorously, and allow sample to stand at room temperature for 5 min.Centrifuge the mixture at 10,000 rpm and 4 °C for 15 min.Transfer aqueous phase to a new tube and add 20 µg of glycogen.Add an equal volume of isopropanol into the aqueous liquid, invert several times to mix and incubate at -20 °C for 60 min.Centrifuge for 15 min at 10,000 rpm and 4 °C.Discard the supernatant and wash the RNA pellets with 70% ethanol.Remove the supernatant and air-dry the pellet at room temperature.Dissolve the RNA in 7 µL of nuclease-free water. The RNA can be stored at -80 °C for small RNA library construction. Western blot analysis for immunoprecipitation quality control  Load 20 µL per sample of the crude extract from step C4 and the GFP-AGO1 immunoprecipitate from step C9 on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel.Follow the protocols for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and western blotting to detect GFP-AGO1 using GFP antibody (Mahmood and Yang, 2012). The size of GFP-AGO1 is approximately 157 kDa.",
    "Genome wide detection of root cell layer-specific AGO1-bound small RNAs  Recovered RNAs were subjected to library construction using NEBNext Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina according to the manual (https://www.neb.com/protocols/2018/03/27/protocol-for-use-with-nebnext-small-rna-library-prep-set-for-illumina-e7300-e7580-e7560-e7330[href=https://www.neb.com/protocols/2018/03/27/protocol-for-use-with-nebnext-small-rna-library-prep-set-for-illumina-e7300-e7580-e7560-e7330]). sRNA library recovery for sequencing  Make a 12% polyacrylamide gel.Add 6× DNA loading dye into the library, mix well by pipetting, and load the sample into the gel. Load 10 µL of 10 bp O'RangeRuler DNA ladder into the same gel.Perform gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer at 150 V for 90 min.Stain the gel with ethidium bromide in 0.5× TBE buffer for 5 min. Cut out the bands at 140–150 bp.Place the gel slice into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and smash the gel into small pieces using pipette tips.Add 500 µL of 0.4 M NaCl into the tube and elute the sRNA library DNA from the gel by rotating the sample for 6 h or overnight at 4 °C.Centrifuge the tube at 15,000  × g  and room temperature for 1 min and transfer the supernatant into a new tube. Repeat this step two times; avoid transferring any gel into the tube.Add 1/10 volume of 3 M sodium acetate, two volumes of 100% ethanol, and 20 µg of glycogen, mix the solution, and keep at -20 °C for 6 h.Centrifuge at 16,000  × g  for 30 min at 4 °C to pellet the library. Discard the supernatant and wash the pellet with 70% ethanol.Centrifuge at 16,000  × g  for 10 min at 4 °C, discard the supernatant, and air-dry the pellet.Dissolve the library DNA in 30 µl of nuclease-free water.Process the small RNAseq data using home-made pipeline pRNASeqTools (https://github.com/grubbybio/pRNASeqTools[href=https://github.com/grubbybio/pRNASeqTools])."
