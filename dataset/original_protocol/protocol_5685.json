    "Protein extraction and separation of membrane fraction from plant tissuesHarvest tissue in liquid nitrogen. If not used immediately, keep at -80 °C until processing.Grind tissue in liquid nitrogen and weigh out 0.5 g of the ground tissues in empty Falcon tube that has been pre-chilled in liquid nitrogen and used to tare the scale.Add 6 ml of ice-cold protein extraction buffer to ground tissues on ice.Vortexat room temperature to mix thoroughly.Filter homogenized tissue through four layers of cheese cloth and transfer filtrate (flow-through) to 2-ml microcentrifuge tubes, on ice.Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 45 min at 4 °C and transfer supernatant to ultra- centrifuge tube.Separate total membrane fractions by ultra-centrifugation at 203,000 x g for 60 min at 4 °C. Discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1 ml ice-cold 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4).Protein estimation using Bradford microassay (160 μl)Prepare BSA standards ranging from 5 μg-25 μg/ml as follows:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140925/20140925043030_9737.jpgThese standards will be used to generate a standard curve.Use 96 well microtiter plate to prepare reaction mix.Prepare blank byadding 160 μl of water to one well in triplicates.Prepare test samples by adding 2 μl of supernatant (from section 1) to 158 μl of water.Add 40 μl of Bradford Assay reagent to BSA standards, blank and test samples.Mix and incubate at room temperature for 5 min and read absorbance at 595 nm (A595) on plate reader spectrophotometer.Note: If spectrophotometer does not include a software to generate standard curve to automatically estimate protein content, generate a BSA standard curve by plotting known protein concentration (X-axis) vs. Absorbance (in Y-axis). Protein concentration for a given unknown sample is estimated by plotting the A595 absorbance of the unknown (in the y-axis) and determining the intersection point with the BSA standard curve and then find the concentration associated with that particular point (in the x-axis).",
    "If using excel, after plotting concentration vs A595, obtain the trendline and use the equation for the line and the A595 of the unknown to resolve the unknown concentration.NADPH oxidase activity assayPrepare fresh solution of 1 mM XTT and 1 mM NADPH.Prepare two different assay solutions A and B:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140925/20140925043309_6260.jpgNote: Because membrane fraction can spontaneously reduce XTT, even in the absence of substrate (NADPH), it is necessary to prepare two blanks, one without NADPH, to correct for this background levels of activity.Prepare blanks:Blank 1: Add 10 μl of water to 240 μl of Assay solution A.Blank 2: Add 10 μl of membrane fraction to 240 μl Assay solution B.Prepare samples by adding 10 μl of membrane fraction (from section 1) to 240 μl of Assay solution A. Read the absorbance at 492 nm (A492) at 0 min and then 20 min intervals for one hour or until saturation point reached.To get final A492 Blank reading, subtracts A492 Blank1 and A492 Blank 2.Calculate rate of O2– generation by using an extinction coefficient 2.16 x 104 cm-(Jiang and Zhang 2002).(ΔA492nm/min test-ΔA492nm/min blank) / (2.16X104M-1CM-1) (0.04)ΔA492nm/min Test= A492 (sample X) at saturation point - A492 (sample X) at 0 minΔA492nm/min blank = A492nm (blank) at saturation point - A492nm (blank) at 0 min0.04 = dilution factor (10 μl/250 μl)To calculate specific activity, divide the value obtained in equation by the amount of protein present in the sample (converted to mg/ml)."
