    "NOTE: The methods described in this manuscript were approved by the bioethics committee of the Lariboisière School of Medicine, Paris, France (CEEALV/2011–08-01).\n1. Instrument Preparation\nPrepare and clean the following instruments for catheter insertion: micro-forceps, micro-scissors, micro-vascular clamp, large scissors, surgical thread (Black braided silk 4-0) and a 14 G catheter. Heparinize the catheter with a heparin solution (5,000 U/ml).\nPrepare and clean the following instruments for the laminectomy: large scissors, scalpel and a bone cutter. Perform laminectomy with a custom-made bone cutter designed to reduce the risk of harming the spinal cord during the laminectomy (Figure 1).\nSet-up the 3D-frame used for positioning and stabilization of the animal. The custom-made frame is built with the elements of an External Fixator Hoffman 3 in association with forceps, which have been curved in order to fit the lumbar spine of the animal.\nPrepare the weight-drop device (impactor) used for spinal cord biomechanical injury.\n\tNOTE: The custom-made impaction device was designed with a 3D software and printed in 3D.\nTurn on the ultrasound machine.\nPrepare the kit for reconstitution of the contrast agent.\n\tNOTE: The kit includes 1 vial containing 25 mg of lyophilised powder, 1 pre-filled syringe containing 5 ml sodium chloride and one mini-spike transfer system (Figure 2). The steps for reconstitution of the contrast agent are detailed below (in section 5).\n2. Jugular Vein Catheterization (Figure 3)\nAnesthetize the animal with 4% isoflurane. Place the animal in supine position. Confirm proper anesthetization by ensuring that the animal is unresponsive when the paws are pinched with a forceps. Apply vet ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.",
    "Shave the neck and clean the skin. Make an incision on the midline of the neck. Retract the sternocleidomastoidian muscle in order to find the internal jugular vein. Tighten a ligature at the rostral part of the vein.\nApply a microvascular clamp on the vein, 1 cm below the ligature. Pass another thread around the vein, just below the clamp with the knot ready to be tighten when the clamp is released.\nOpen the wall of vein (venotomy) between the clamp and the rostral ligature. Introduce a 14 G catheter in the lumen of the vein and push it toward the heart.\nWhen it comes up against the clamp, release the latter and push the catheter further. Secure the catheter in the vein, by firmly tightening the knot on the vein with the catheter inside.\nAssess patency of the catheter by withdrawing a small amount of venous blood in the catheter and subsequently then flushing it with heparinized saline. This prevents obstruction of the catheter by a potential blood clot.\nConnect flexible tubing to the catheter for further injection of contrast agent (microbubbles). Keep it closed (sealed) until ready for use.\n3. Accessing the Spine, Laminectomy and Rat Positioning (in the 3D-frame)\nPlace the animal in a flat prone horizontal position. Shave and clean the back (thoracic region) of the animal.\nIdentify the last rib (the XIIIth in the rat) by palpation (Figure 4). This allows one to estimate the location of the XIIIth thoracic vertebra (ThXIII).\nMake a 4 cm skin incision on the midline, centered on ThXIII. Open the skin incision as well as the underlying bursa. Observe the aponeurosis of back muscles as well as the tips of the vertebral spine processes.\nCarefully localize the spine process of ThXIII by palpating the XIIIth ribs.",
    "NOTE: The XIIIth rib is connected to ThXIII and therefore represents an easy to locate anatomic landmark for the identification of ThXIII. This step enables the localization of the ThXII to ThIX spinous process as well as L1 and L2 (first and second lumbar vertebras).\nCut the muscular aponeurosis and detach the muscles on either side to expose the spinous processes, the laminas and the facet joints from ThIX to L2. Expose the lateral aspects of L1 and L2 by detaching muscles from the transverse processes.\nHook the animal’s incisor teeth on the 3D-frame to secure the position (Figure 5). Clamp the L1 and L2 vertebras with the modified forceps. Connect the modified forceps to the 3D-frame in order to stabilize the animal.\nGently pull caudally the forceps holding the lumbar spine in order to tighten the whole spine and to elevate the thorax from the bench.\n\tNOTE: With the described arrangement the animal should be able to breath. Furthermore, despite respiratory movements of the rib cage, the spine and the spinal cord should also remain immobile.\nRemove the spinous processess from ThIX to ThXII. Gently insert the inferior blade of the bone cutter beneath the left lamina of ThXII and then close the bone cutter in order to cut the lamina (Figure 6).\nRepeat the same manoeuvre for the right lamina and successively remove the posterior arch. Repeat the previous steps for the vertebras ThXI to ThIX in order to achieve a four-level laminectomy. Remove both facet joints for each vertebra.\n\tNOTE: Throughout the procedure, clean the operative field from local bleeding. For that, use cotton swabs and irrigation with tepid saline. Hemostasis systematically occurs within minutes.\n4. CEU Probe Positioning",
    "Cover the dura mater with ultrasound gel. This allows effective transmission of the ultrasound waves between the probe and the spinal cord (Figure 7).\nStabilize the ultrasound probe with a clamp that can be subsequently connected to the 3D-frame by a jointed arm. Manually position the probe. Ensure that the probe is oriented to obtain an oblique longitudinal sagittal slice. In a correct position, the spinal cord is strictly horizontal on the image and the central canal of the spinal cord is visible along the full segment of the spinal cord.\n\tNOTE: Positioning should be guided by the real-time B-mode image displayed on the screen of the ultrasound machine. The focal distance of the ultrasound probe should be aligned with the central canal of the spinal cord. At this time, the posterior aspect of the spinal cord is accessible which will ultimately allow for positioning of the impactor.\nWhen optimal, lock the jointed arm to stabilize the position.\n5. Preparation of Contrast Agent - Microbubble Reconstitution\nUsing the contents of a commercial reconstitution kit and connect the plunger rod by fastening it tightly into the syringe (clockwise). Open the transfer system blister and remove the syringe tip cap. Open the transfer system cap and connect the syringe to the transfer system (fasten tightly).\nRemove the protective disk from the vial. Slide the vial into the transparent sleeve of the\ntransfer system and press firmly to lock the vial in place.\nEmpty the contents of the syringe into the vial by pushing on the plunger rod. Shake vigorously for 20 sec to mix all the contents in the vial to obtain a white milky homogeneous liquid.",
    "Invert the system and carefully withdraw the contrast agent into the syringe. Unscrew the syringe from the transfer system. After reconstitution (as directed), 1 ml of the resulting dispersion contains 8 µl sulphur hexafluoride in the microbubbles. Draw the suspension of microbubbles into a 100 ml syringe. Insert the 100 ml syringe into the electric pump. Close the lid.\nStart constant agitation of the reconstituted microbubbles. Obtained constant agitation by slow rotation of the syringe, which maintains the microbubble suspension. Connect the pump to the jugular catheter through the flexible tubing. Set the ultrasound machine to “Harmonic Mode”.\n\tNOTE: The latter corresponds to the mode in which the microbubbles can be specifically detected and visualized. This mode has a low mechanical index, which doesn’t destroy the microbubbles as opposed to the B-mode.\nPurge the catheter by infusing a first dose (400 µl) of contrast agent. During this first infusion, check that the microbubbles do appear on the ultrasound screen. This confirms that the whole circuit (from the syringe to the rat’s bloodstream) is intact and open.\nSet the ultrasound machine to “B-mode” to visualize the spinal cord parenchyma and the destruction of the few microbubbles remaining in the bloodstream. The high frequency of the “B-Mode” transmits high energy to the microbubbles, which enables them to breakdown.\nLet the animal lay still for approximately 30 min. This period allows for the stabilization of the haemodynamic parameters.\n6. Assessment of SCBF in the Intact Spinal Cord\nSet the ultrasound machine to the “Harmonic Mode”. Start simultaneously (1) infusion of contrast agent (400 µl) and (2) the chronometer.",
    "NOTE: During the infusion, the concentration of microbubbles in the bloodstream should increase, enabling the contrast imagining of the spinal cord (Figure 8). Since the microbubbles are quickly destroyed, the blood concentration of microbubbles starts decreasing once the injection is completed which generates a progressive decrease in contrast visualization of the spinal cord.\nAfter 1 min, select (press) the “Clip Store” button on the ultrasound machine. This will enable one to save 1 min of raw ultrasound data and the imaging video recording (that was previously displayed on the ultrasound screen).\nSet the ultrasound machine to “B-Mode”. This will eliminate the remaining microbubbles.\n7. Experimental SCI\nUsing the micromanipulator connected to the 3D-frame, position the weight-drop impaction device so that the tip of the impactor comes in contact with the dura mater (on the spinal cord midline), at the junction between ThX and ThXI (Figure 9).\n\tNOTE: This level should correspond to the middle of the segment of spinal cord observed with the ultrasound device. The striker and the body of the impactor are 8 mm in diameter. The tip of the impactor, which will generate the injury, is 3 mm in diameter.\nPlace the striker of the impaction device at a 10 cm-high position. Induce the experimental SCI by releasing the striker of the impaction device. The striker falls and releases the impactor, injuring the spinal cord. The custom made impaction delivers an impact equivalent to a 10 g weight dropped from a height of 10 cm.\n8. Assessment of SCBF 5 min Post-SCI\nRepeat the steps described in section 6 (Assessment of SCBF). The microbubbles will be unable to pass through the damaged microvasculature and the injury epicenter will remain dark (Figure 10).\n9. Animal Sacrifice\nEuthanize the animal with intra-peritoneal lethal injection of pentobarbital (100 mg).",
    "10. Quantification of SCBF by Offline Analysis\nStart the Ultra-Extend Software used for quantification (on ultrasound machine). Select “file” and then select previously saved raw data and open the associated files. Activate the “quantification mode” by pressing (selecting) the “Chi Q” button. Select “Set ROI” (button) and choose the circular shape.\nSelect “Draw ROI” (button) and draw seven adjacent circular regions of interest (ROI) on the spinal cord (Figure 11). Open the menu “Fitting” and choose the function “Curve value”. Observe the software displaying several curves, each corresponding to the changes of microbubbles concentration inside a ROI.\n\tNOTE: Each curve has a “perfusion-deperfusion” profile. The first phase of the curve is flat and corresponds to the period before the arrival of microbubbles. In the second phase, the concentration of microbubbles quickly increases as a result of the infusion. In the third phase, which begins when the infusion is complete, the concentration of microbubbles progressively decreases as they disintegratse in the bloodstream.\nPlace the first vertical line at the beginning of the second phase of the curve and select “SET”. This informs the software where to begin analysis.\nPlace the second vertical line at the end of the recording and once again select “SET”. This informs the software where to stop analysis.\nLook at the “Cv” menu and record the “AUC” value, which corresponds to the “Area Under the Curve” analyzed. This value is proportional to the SCBF inside the corresponding ROI.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
