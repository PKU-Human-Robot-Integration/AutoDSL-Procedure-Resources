    "Optimization of a new assay can be time-consuming and sometimes challenging; to overcome these difficulties, the following protocol describes a step-by-step methodology for generating an in vitro high-throughput assay, employing luciferase reporter gene technology, to identify PXR activators. The first steps describe thawing and culturing a double-stable cell line that includes an hPXR expression vector and CYP3A4-luciferase plasmid (Lin et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-bib-0010]). A double-stable cell line is preferred so that transient transfection does not need to be performed; eliminating this decreases the experiment time and creates more consistent data by generating a uniform population of cells containing both vectors in each well of the assay plate. Every laboratory needs to optimize the assay by testing a different number of cells/well, positive control concentration, and/or equipment settings. Therefore, an optimization step to address each of these items is necessary. Here, we show how to test multiple concentrations of cells/well and explain how to determine the optimal conditions for the assay. Once the optimization is complete, the assay will be ready for use in a high-throughput manner and ready to screen hundreds or thousands of compounds in one experiment.\nNOTE: This protocol must be completed in a biological safety cabinet, to keep contamination to a minimum.\nMaterials\nEagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM; ATCC, cat. no. 30-2003)\nHyClone Characterized Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS; Cytiva, cat. no.

In the biological safety cabinet, set up a 500-ml vacuum filter system. Prepare thaw medium by combining 500 ml EMEM, 50 ml FBS, and 5 ml Pen-Strep and filter the liquid.\nThaw medium can be stored up to 1 month at 4°C.",
    "Every item going in and out of the biological safety cabinet should be wiped down with 70% ethanol to minimize contamination.\n2. Warm thaw medium to 37°C using a water bath.\n3. In the biological safety cabinet, put 9 ml warmed thaw medium into a 15-ml tube.\nA different amount of medium can be used as long as you later balance that amount in the centrifuge.\n4. Take a single vial of frozen HepG2-CYP3A4-hPXR cells and place in a 37°C water bath for ∼3 min or until the mix starts to thaw.\nThe abrupt temperature shift from −150°C to 37°C can be damaging to some of the cells. Limiting the thaw time in the water bath can help alleviate this effect. If using a 175-cm2 flask or larger, ensure that at least 10 million cells are being thawed.\n5. Wipe the vial with 70% ethanol and then, in the safety cabinet, pour the cell solution into the 9 ml of warmed thaw medium. Remove any remaining liquid in the vial and transfer into the 15-ml tube, using a 200-µl micropipettor or similar.\nAny small pipet will suffice as long as the tip is small enough to get into the bottom of the vial.\n6. Pipet up and down five to ten times with a 10-ml pipet to break up clumps of cells.\n7. Centrifuge cells 4 min at 900 rpm (100 × g), room temperature.\nBecause high speeds are being used, remember to balance the centrifuge properly.\n8. Pour off supernatant from cell pellet into a waste bin and add 10 ml fresh prewarmed thaw medium. Pipet cells up and down at least ten times using a 10-ml pipet. Pour this cell suspension into a 175-cm2 collagen-I-coated flask and swirl around slightly.",
    "A collagen-coated flask is used for more optimal attachment of cells and can even improve end results.\n9. Incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2, for a few days, or until cells are at least 80% confluent.\nCulturing HepG2-CYP3A4-hPXR cells\n10. Warm up PXR culture medium in a 37°C water bath. Let trypsin solution warm up to room temperature.\n11. Pour off used medium from the HepG2-CYP3A4-hPXR cells flask into a waste bin.\n12. Add 10 ml PBS to the flask and swirl around. Pour off PBS into waste bin. Repeat two times.\nThis is a very important step. All the debris needs to be washed away with PBS that does not contain calcium chloride (CaCl2) or magnesium chloride (MgCl2) before the trypsin is added. If no PBS is used, or PBS with CaCl2 and MgCl2 is used, the cells will not detach from the flask properly.\n13. Add 6 ml trypsin solution to the flask and swirl around to cover the entire flask. Place the flask in the incubator for 3-5 min until cells start to detach from flask.\n14. Add 4 ml prewarmed PXR culture medium to the flask. Swirl or pipet liquid around to release and gather as many cells as possible. Suck up cells and medium and transfer into a 50-ml tube.\n15. Centrifuge 4 min at 900 rpm (100 × g), room temperature.\n16. Pour off supernatant and resuspend cells in 10 ml fresh prewarmed PXR culture medium. Pipet up and down at least ten times to break up clumps.\n17. Acquire a fresh 175-cm2 collagen-I-coated flask and pour 40 ml fresh prewarmed PXR culture medium into the flask.\n18. Count the cells and transfer ∼20 million cells into the flask. Place flask in the 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator and incubate until the cells become ∼80% confluent.",
    "There may be cell debris over the next few days as the selection antibiotic starts to work and kill the cells lacking the correct plasmid. If there appear to be a lot of floating cells, it may be prudent to pour off the medium and add fresh culture medium to the flask.\n19. Culture cells for at least another passage by repeating steps 11-19. This is to ensure that the highest number of the correct cells are present.\nUsually, these cells need to be subcultured every 3-4 days. Once they are 80% confluent, they should be used for the assay or passaged again.\nPerforming optimization assay\n20. Warm assay medium to 37°C using a water bath.\n21. Repeat steps 12-17 using prewarmed PXR assay medium instead of culture medium. Count the newly made cell suspension.\n22. Generate 5.0 × 105 cells/ml and 9.0 × 105 cells/ml solutions using PXR assay medium.\n23. Plate 5 µl of each suspension into the first four columns of white 1536-well plates using a liquid dispenser.\nIn this example, the number of cells in plate 1 should be ∼2500 cells/well, while plate 2 should have 4500 cells/well. This cell number is one of the parameters which will be optimized to fit the needs of the experiment. These assays can also be adapted for plates with fewer wells; an optimization and scale-up will need to be performed.\n24. Place a microplate lid on top of each assay plate and incubate the plates at 37°C, 5% CO2 for ∼4-5 hr.\nThis is done so that the cells have adequate time to attach to the bottom of each well.",
    "25. Create a positive control compound plate for the assay using DMSO, rifampicin, and tetraoctylammonium bromide in the first four columns of a fresh clear compound plate. Store at −20°C when not in use.\nAn example of this can be seen in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-fig-0002] (top left plate) and would contain a duplicate 1:2 dilution of rifampicin starting at 20 mM (final concentration of 92 µM) in column 1; the upper half of column 2 then contains a single dose of rifampicin at 10 mM (final concentration of 46 µM), the lower half of column 2 contains a single dose of rifampicin at 5 mM (final concentration of 23 µM), the upper half of column 3 and all of column 4 contain DMSO, and the lower half of column 3 contains tetraoctylammonium bromide at 20 mM (final concentration of 92 µM). The tetraocylammonium bromide only needs to be added to the control plate if a cytotoxicity assay is being performed in tandem, but can be omitted if this control plate will not be used for another assay. Either of the single dose concentrations of rifampicin can be used as the positive control—whichever concentration gives the highest signal. These two concentrations can be optimized for each laboratory's own use.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/9fd83bb1-cdc5-40c4-8953-ece78604f396/cpz1615-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",
    "Compound plate map for treating cells with controls. When combining a positive control and cells into one assay plate, the pintool is used to automatically add 23 nl of positive control liquid into each well already containing cells. The light pink wells in the assay plate (top right) represent plated cells which have already attached to the bottom. The dark red wells in column 1 of the control compound plate (top left) represent the dose-response (DR) dilution series of rifampicin, the positive control. The dark pink and medium pink wells in column 2 represent the single concentrations of rifampicin used in the assay—10 mM and 5 mM, respectively. The black wells in the bottom of column 3 represent 20 mM tetraoctylammonium bromide, while the green wells in columns 3 and 4 represent the DMSO-only negative control wells. A picture of the pintool station is also included in the middle of the figure. This image was created with BioRender (biorender.com).\n26. Transfer 23 nl from each well of the positive control plate to the cell plate using a Wako Pintool station. Incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 hr.\nFigure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-fig-0003] shows the proper confluency and healthiness of this cell line, plated in a 1536-well plate after a 23-hr treatment with DMSO.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/1728759c-58bd-4430-807b-39c38c259080/cpz1615-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nMorphology of healthy HepG2-hPXR-CYP3A4 cells.

Add 4 µl ONE-Glo reagent to each well including cells (first four columns of plates 1 and 2). Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.",
    "We assessed both ONE-Glo and Reagent 2 (from a different kit) luminescent reagents to determine which exhibited optimal performance in our conditions (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-fig-0004]). Different luciferase reagents can be studied to establish which works best in each laboratory.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0bae302d-19c1-4683-a373-b059a90b7443/cpz1615-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nComparison of luminescent reagents. HepG2-hPXR-CYP3A4 cells were treated with multiple concentrations of rifampicin, and luminescence values were identified after the addition of either ONE-Glo or Reagent 2. Each curve represents the mean ± SD of duplicate wells. M, molar concentration.\n28. Acquire the luminescence signal from the plate using a plate reader.\nIf using a ViewLux IMAGER, example settings are as follow: 60 s readout, low speed, high gain, 2× binning. These numbers will need to be optimized depending on the specific assay and instrument used.\n29. Analyze the data using the equation below, and generate the % activity curve using GraphPad (Fig. 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-fig-0005]).\nUse the following equation to analyze the concentration response curves: % activity = [(Vcompound – VDMSO)/(Vrifampicin – VDMSO)]*100, where Vcompound equals the well values, Vrifampicin denotes the median value of the 16 wells of rifampicin at one concentration, and VDMSO represents the median values of the DMSO-only wells. Remember to transform the concentrations (x axis) into log(x) values to have correct graphical representation. To do this in GraphPad, once the molar concentrations are typed in with their respective % activity data, press the analyze button and click transform. When the new window pops up, click the box marked “Transform X values using.” Toggle down to X = Log(X) and click ok.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/7ff61a96-134f-4ddf-93c9-56ae6941cb6e/cpz1615-fig-0005-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 5",
    "Optimization of cell number per well in 1536-well plates. HepG2-hPXR-CYP3A4 cells were plated with 2500 cells/well or 4500 cells/well. Luminescence values were determined after the rifampicin treatment, and the % activity was calculated by comparing each data point to that of the positive control, RIF (100% = RIF activity). Each curve represents the mean ± SD of triplicate wells. M, molar concentration.\n30. Acquire an EC50 for all compounds.\nOnce % activity values are put into GraphPad and the concentrations are transformed into log values, click analyze again. Under the XY analyses topic, click “Nonlinear regression (curve fit).” When the new window pops up, use the “log(agonist) versus response – Variable slope (four parameters)” and click ok. Once the analysis comes up, copy the EC50 values onto your graph. Data should be in a sigmoidal shape with an actual number as an EC50, not an ambiguous one (∼). When analyzing the curve for the positive control, the top of the curve should have a value of ∼100% because the positive-control dose-response numbers are being compared to a single concentration of the same compound (rifampicin).\n31. Choose the optimum cell number, based on the % activity curve and EC50.\nBased on Figure 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-fig-0005], 2500 cells/well gives an EC50 of 2.437 µM while 4500 cells/well gives an ambiguous ∼190.4 M EC50. The curvature is also sigmoidal for the 2500 cells/well but not for the 4500 cells/well. Therefore, the cell number that should be used for Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0002] is 2500 cells/well.",
    "Once the assay has been optimized according to Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0001], a high-throughput screen can be conducted. Profiling thousands of compounds at one time will reduce total experiment time and reagent supplies. In essence, Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0002] is the same assay as that completed in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0001], just on a larger scale. This protocol describes the steps in performing a high-throughput luciferase reporter gene assay to identify hPXR activators from a large library of compounds. After the screening is complete, the potency and efficacy of each compound tested can be calculated. The potential PXR agonists identified from the screen can be further examined in the confirmation assays (covered in Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0003]). This protocol will also explain how to identify the most potent and efficacious compounds by calculating the maximum response and EC50 values; however, there is a need to account for the shape of the concentration curve as well, previously explained in a methods chapter (Huang, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-bib-0005]).\nNOTE: This protocol must be completed in a biological safety cabinet, to keep contamination to a minimum.\nMaterials\nHepG2-CYP3A4-hPXR stable cell line (Dr. Taosheng Chen, Department of Chemical Biology and Therapeutics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; Lin et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-bib-0010])\nPXR assay medium (see recipe)\nPhenol-red-free Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 31053028)\nFBS, charcoal stripped (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 12676029)\n100 mM sodium pyruvate (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 11360070)\n200 mM l-glutamine (ThermoFisher Scientific, cat. no. 25030081)\nPositive control plate (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0001], step 26)\nCompound library plates: e.g., Tox21 10K compound library plates (Attene-Ramos et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-bib-0002])\nONE-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega, cat. no.

    "Library plates should have compounds in columns 5-48 only. The assay plates should contain compounds from the control plates in columns 1-4 and compounds from the library plates in columns 5-48.

Lack of access to a robot will be a rate-limiting step in many laboratories.

Select positive compounds as well as a few negative compounds. Repeat assay with newly formed compound plates comprising those selected compounds.",
    "Identify compounds with high efficacy (maximum response) and low potency (EC50) values (Huang, 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-bib-0005]). In GraphPad, the maximum response value is listed as “Top.” An example of this narrowing down is to use an efficacy value of >80% of rifampicin's value (positive control) with a potency value of <10 µM. However, these values can be adjusted based on the results of each assay. It is important to include some negative test compounds as well to confirm the validity of the assay.\n8. Proceed to Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0003] to complete follow-up studies on a small collection of the most promising compounds.\nThe number of selected compounds should relate to the ability of the laboratory to complete each follow-up assay. The selection of compounds should be based on highest efficacy, lowest potency, pricing, commercial availability, and practical or clinical importance of compounds.",
    "Once a manageable group of compounds has been chosen after a primary screening, such as in Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0002], additional studies can be conducted to further confirm compound modulation of PXR. Here we first discuss how to perform a pharmacological study, which will display a shift in EC50 values and concentration response curves if the compound's activity is due to PXR activation. If, after the addition of increasing amounts of PXR antagonist (SPA70; Lin et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-bib-0010]), a compound's EC50 value becomes higher in conjunction with a right-shifting concentration response curve, the compound is further confirmed as a PXR activator. The second section demonstrates how to perform an RT-qPCR assay to identify the induction or inhibition of the mRNA expression of a particular gene. In this case, we are looking at the main DME that PXR regulates, CYP3A4. If a compound activates PXR, it should also increase the expression level of CYP3A4. The combination of these assays should corroborate the previous data, from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0002], and a safe conclusion can be made to identify a compound as a true PXR activator.\nNOTE: This protocol must be completed in a biological safety cabinet, to keep contamination to a minimum.\nMaterials\nCandidate compounds (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0002], step 7)\nHepG2-CYP3A4-hPXR stable cell line (Dr. Taosheng Chen, Department of Chemical Biology and Therapeutics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital; Lin et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-bib-0010])\nPXR assay medium (see recipe)\nDimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Millipore Sigma, cat. no. 472301, CAS no. 67-68-5)\nSPA70 (Millipore Sigma, cat. no.

Aliquot the promising compounds chosen, from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0002], step 7, into clear 1536-well compound plates.\nSet up the plates so that a concentration response curve can be acquired from them, remembering to use only columns 5-48 of the compound plate so that the previously made positive control plate (columns 1-4) can still be used. Therefore, use a 1:3 dilution starting with 20 mM stock compound in DMSO. Each compound should have quadruplicate amounts of each concentration. For example, the first compound chosen should have a 20 mM concentration in wells 5A, 6A, 5B, and 6B. This compound should then have a 6.67 mM concentration in wells 5C, 6C, 5D, and 6D. This should be repeated until 5AF and 6AF are filled. Columns 7 and 8 should contain the next chosen compound, and so on.\n2. Generate a HepG2-CYP3A4-hPXR cell suspension, using assay medium from the cells still being passaged from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0001], step 20, with a concentration of 6.25 × 105 cells/ml. Plate 4 µl cell suspension into every well of white/solid 1536-well plates using a liquid dispenser. Place a lid on top of each plate, place the plates in a 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator, and incubate ∼4-5 hr.",
    "Because only 4 µl of cells can be plated, the concentration of cell suspension needs to be 6.25 × 105 cells/ml instead of the 5 × 105 cells/ml used previously in Basic Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0001] and 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0002]. Plate three times as many plates as there are compound plates made in step 2. For example, if there was one plate of follow-up compounds generated, plate three plates full of cells. Perform this experiment three times when possible so that proper statistics and robust data can be attained. Leave the plates in the incubator until the cells are attached.\n3. Transfer 23 nl from each well of the previously generated positive control plate from Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0001], step 26, as well as 23 nl from each well of the compound plates produced in step 2, to each cell plate using a Wako Pintool station (Fig. 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-fig-0006]).\n4. Using assay medium, make 2.5 ml (per plate) of co-treatment (2.5 µM SPA70, 3.75 µM SPA70, and DMSO):\n         \na.Add 6.25 µl of 1 mM SPA70 stock (in DMSO) to 2.5 ml of assay medium to generate 2.5 µM SPA70.\nb.Add 9.38 µl of 1 mM SPA70 stock (in DMSO) to 2.5 ml of assay medium to generate 3.75 µM SPA70.\nc.Add 9.38 µl of DMSO to 2.5 ml of assay medium to represent the negative control.\nAlways use the same amount of DMSO as the highest amount of compound added. SPA70 is a known selective PXR antagonist (Lin et al., 2008[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-bib-0010]). The concentrations of SPA70 chosen here were identified using optimization assays. However, the concentrations may vary depending on the performance of the assay in a different laboratory.",
    "5. In every well of the respective plates, add 1 µl of DMSO co-treatment to plate 1, 2.5 µM SPA70 (final concentration of 0.5 µM) co-treatment to plate 2, and 3.75 µM SPA70 (final concentration of 0.75 µM) co-treatment to plate 3.\n6. Follow steps 28-30 of Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-prot-0001] to perform the luciferase reporter gene experiment on these plates.\nWhen the three curves from each compound are compiled into one graph, a clear right shift should be seen from DMSO to increasing SPA70 concentrations for each positive compound, as shown in Figure 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-fig-0007].\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/95c2d184-434c-4cb1-8801-580c9624104d/cpz1615-fig-0007-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 7\nPharmacological characterization of compound A. In this pharmacological assay, HepG2-hPXR-CYP3A4 cells were treated with multiple concentrations of compound A and co-treated with 0, 0.5, or 0.75 µM of SPA70, a known PXR inhibitor. The % activity was calculated by comparing each data point to the positive control, RIF (100% = RIF activity). Data are expressed as the mean ± SD of triplicate experiments. M, molar concentration.\nQuantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction\n7. Make HepaRG™ culture medium by combining 200 ml of William's E Medium, 23.6 ml of HepaRG™ Thawing and Plating Medium Supplement (MHTAP), and 0.5 ml (25 U/ml) of Pen-Strep.\nHepaRG™ culture medium can be stored for up to 1 month at 4°C.\nEvery item going in and out of the biological safety cabinet should be wiped down with 70% ethanol solution to minimize contamination. The supplements used may require another optimization step, for optimal data; it is recommended that the manufacturer's instructions for other supplements be checked if the experiment does not appear to work.\n8. Warm the HepaRG™ culture medium in a 37°C water bath.\n9. Thaw a frozen vial of HepaRG™ cells in a 37°C water bath until only a small piece of ice remains (∼90 sec).",
    "Do not fully submerge the vial into the water bath, as this may cause contamination; only submerge enough of the vial in water to cover the frozen cells.\n10. Add the entire vial of cells into 9 ml of the prewarmed HepaRG™ culture medium.\nUse a small pipet to ensure the entire amount of liquid is transferred from the vial of cells. A 15- or 50-ml conical tube may be used for this step.\n11. Centrifuge 5 min at 900 rpm (100 × g), room temperature.\nThe manufacturer recommends skipping the centrifugation step when plating these cells; however, in our hands, a spin step generates a clean pellet free from any freezing chemicals with no harsh ramifications.\n12. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet using 10 ml fresh prewarmed HepaRG™ culture medium.\n13. Plate HepaRG™ cells in a 12-well collagen-I-coated plate at a concentration of 8 × 105 cells/well (Day 0).\nCells should be plated in a confluent manner as these are fully differentiated and will not be passaged further.\n14. Incubate the plates at 37°C, 5% CO2.\n15. Acquire the EC70 for each selected compound using GraphPad software.\nOnce the % activity values from the primary high-throughput screen are input into GraphPad and the concentrations are transformed into log values, click analyze again. Under the XY analyses topic, click “Nonlinear regression (curve fit).” When the new window pops up, go to the section labeled “Dose Response – Special” and click the “log(agonist) versus response – Find ECanything.” Next, click on the Constrain tab and put “70” into the value box next to the constant F (where F = fraction of maximal response). Click ok. Once the analysis comes up, copy the EC70 values onto your graph.",
    "16. On day 3, after determining that the cells are healthy by assessment under a microscope, exchange the old medium with 1 ml fresh medium per well.\nSee Figure 8A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-fig-0008] for an image of what healthy cells look like under 10× magnification. If the cells get contaminated or look unhealthy (Fig. 8B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-fig-0008]), they should be discarded, and the experiment started over.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/dc553eaf-caa2-4973-8141-26cb04c680d5/cpz1615-fig-0008-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 8\nMorphology of healthy and toxicity-affected HepaRG cells. HepaRG cells were treated for 23 hr with DMSO (A) and a toxic compound (B), visually representing proper healthy cells and damaged cells, respectively. The microscope pictures were taken at 10×.\n17. Treat the cells with each of the promising compounds (one well per treatment) by adding the correct amount of stock solution to the fresh medium.\nUsing the EC70 from the concentration response curve, as the treatment concentration, generated in step 15, is a good starting point. The goal is to use a concentration with a high efficacy but low potency value, so that the cells will remain healthy throughout the experiment. If the EC70 value generates toxicity, lower the concentration in the next experiment. Make sure to also include a negative solvent control of the liquid used to dissolve your compounds (e.g., DMSO) and a positive control (e.g., rifampicin, 10 µM) to ensure the assay worked. Given the expense of metabolically competent cells, we recommend starting with one concentration for each compound. If possible, we also suggest making a 1000× stock solution of the compounds being used so that the user can add 1 µl of stock solution to the 1 ml of fresh medium. For example, generate a 10 mM rifampicin stock solution so that 1 µl will be added to the cells, generating a final treatment concentration of 10 µM.",
    "18. Gently shake the plate vertically, as well as horizontally, four times. This will ensure that the compound is spread around the well and into the correct homogenous concentration.\n19. Replace the treated plate in the 37°C, 5% CO2 incubator and incubate 24 hr.\n20. After the 24-hr treatment, examine each well under a microscope.\nTake note of any toxicity, contamination, or abnormal appearance. This will help make sense of the data if a number seems incorrect after the experiment.\n21. Suck out the medium and wash each well with 1 ml PBS two times.\n22. Harvest the cells by adding 350 µl lysis buffer to each well.\nWe used Buffer RLT from the Qiagen RNeasy midi-prep kit for this protocol. However, other lysis buffers can be used and should be optimized for each respective laboratory. The amount of lysis buffer was based on the manufacturer's recommendation.\nIf necessary, the protocol may be paused here by putting the plate into a −80°C freezer until needed. If no kit is available, TRIzol™ may be used instead for the isolation of RNA; follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully as using this chemical involves many more steps, which can generate errors.\n23. Perform RNA extraction using the RNeasy kit, following the kit instructions precisely.\nFor the final step of this protocol, 30 µl RNase-free water is used to elute the RNA off the column and into a tube. Again, the protocol may be paused here by placing the samples in a −80°C freezer.\n24. Determine the RNA concentration of each sample using a spectrophotometer.",
    "The A260/A280 ratio should be ∼2.0 if your RNA is pure; when there is a protein, phenol, or other contaminant, the ratio will be much lower than 2.0 and the sample will not provide high-quality data. Also, the A260/A230 ratio should be between 2.0 and 2.2; a higher value indicates that the sample may be contaminated with unwanted organic compounds.\n25. Using 1 µg cDNA, perform reverse transcriptase using a high-capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.\ncDNA samples may be stored for up to 1 month at −20°C.\nThis step should be performed on ice up to the point when the samples are put in the thermal cycler. Be sure to vortex and then spin down the samples before placing them into the thermal cycler (step 32).\n26. Add 80 µl DNase/RNase-free distilled water to each sample.\nThis will work for most samples as they are very concentrated. However, it may be necessary to use a smaller dilution factor if the RT-qPCR data cannot be quantified in the final steps (no CT value is detected).\n27. Calculate how many wells, in a 384-well PCR assay plate, are needed for each gene. Figure 9[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-fig-0009] shows an example of a plate setup for five cDNA samples in triplicate.\nA 96-well assay plate may also be used depending on the block in the specific assay machine used for this procedure. Each sample should be tested in triplicate for each gene. There should also always be extra made (e.g., for three extra wells) as some loss can be expected from the pipet tips.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c268e8cb-2e2a-4b78-9a4d-8387a9eb797d/cpz1615-fig-0009-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 9",
    "Illustrative display of an RT-qPCR plate setup. The blue circles represent wells with a GAPDH probe while the pink circles represent wells including a CYP3A4 probe. The red box encircling Row A indicates samples treated with DMSO (three each blue and pink), while the blue box (Row C) defines samples treated with rifampicin, the positive control. The lavender boxes (rows E, G, and I) identify three compounds being tested for identification of modulation of GAPDH and CYP3A4. This image was created with BioRender (biorender.com).\n28. Generate gene mixes according to Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-tbl-0001] using TaqMan™ Master Mix and the appropriate gene probes.\nSYBR Green can also be used here; however, it is a less specific probe and may result in more variable data. TaqMan acquires cleaner, more reproducible data but is much more expensive, so each laboratory must optimize according to their needs. When selecting the correct primers/probes, always include an endogenous control that is stably expressed in the cell line to use as a reference gene (e.g., GAPDH, β-actin, etc.). For all nuclear receptors, commonly regulated genes should be chosen; for example, in this assay, use CYP3A4 to represent modulation of PXR.\nTable 1.\n                An Example of PXR Gene Expression Mixes for RT-qPCR\ntable:\n﻿Unnamed: 0,1 well,GAPDH (18 wells),CYP3A4 (18 wells)\n2× master mix (µl),10,180,180\nProbe (µl),1,18,18\nWater (µl),5,90,90\n29. Add 16 µl of each mix to the corresponding wells being assayed for that gene.\n30. Add 4 µl of each diluted cDNA sample into the correct wells, creating a total of 20 µl per well.",
    "A no-template control should also be tested to ensure that the DNA is not contaminated. To do this, combine 16 µl of each one of the mixes with 4 µl water. The amplification plot for each no-template control mix should display higher CT values than the control or sample dilutions. If they are not, your sample may include extraneous nucleic acid contamination and the assay will need to be completed again with extra precautions against contamination.\n31. Add an adhesive seal firmly onto the plate using a sealing roller, and ensure all sides are correctly stuck.\n32. Mix and spin down the plate, using a vortex (for a few seconds at maximum power) and centrifuge (for 1 min at 1000 rpm, or 163 × g), respectively, to ensure there is a homogenous liquid completely spun into the bottom of the well.\n33. Place the plate into the corresponding block of a PCR machine (thermal cycler).\n34. Perform PCR using a protocol that best fits the primers bought, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n35. Analyze the data according to the fold = 2−ΔΔCt method, where ΔCt represents the differences in cycle threshold numbers between CYP3A4 (or the genes in question) and GAPDH, and ΔΔCt represents the relative change in these differences between negative control and treatment groups (Livak & Schmittgen, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.615#cpz1615-bib-0011])."
