    "All methods described here were found to be exempt from review by the Summa Institutional Review Board.\n1. Day 1 – Pre-Testing Evaluation\nPrint critical action checklists, pretest confidence surveys, pretest cognitive multiple-choice exams.\nPlace three human-patient simulators in ICU beds with the following designations: acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), complete lung atelectasis secondary to mucus plugging, and pneumothorax. Set simulators in separate rooms or far enough apart that learners will not be able to easily hear the other simultaneously executed sessions. Place simulators in a dedicated learning space.\nIntubate the human-patient simulators. Do not place the endotracheal tube in the trachea of the simulator, but rather through a hole in the simulator's inner cheek that leads to the back of the simulator's neck.\n\t\nConnect the corrugated airway tubing from the lung simulator to the endotracheal tube that is now hidden behind the simulator's neck. Once connected, the lung simulator is now functional. Use a pillow to conceal this connection.\nTurn on the lung simulator. Choose selected pathologic state from the menu in the patient library folder. Initiate the selected pathology on the lung simulator.\n\t\nConnect the mechanical ventilator to the endotracheal tube coming out of the simulator's mouth. If the ventilator is connected to the endotracheal tube prior to initiating the lung pathology software program, the ventilator will not function properly.\nConnect human-patient simulators to breathing simulators. Connect the intubated human-patient simulators to mechanical ventilators.\nPlace a simulated patient monitor by each human-patient simulator. Select the vital sign software within the lung simulator program. Choose appropriate initial vital signs for onset of simulated patient presentation. Enable the vital signs monitor.",
    "Upload pre-selected patient's vital signs, portable chest X-ray images, electrocardiograms, and arterial blood gas measurements for each patient case to each respective patient monitor (e.g., autoPEEP images are uploaded to the human-patient simulator designated as the autoPEEP patient).\nSet out critical actions checklists at each station for each learner wherever faculty members will be observing the case. This may be behind a one-way glass or on a bedside table, but at enough distance away that the learners will not be able to read the checklists. Assign one faculty member to each station.\nHave each learner pick a four-digit identifying code to use for confidence surveys, cognitive exams, and critical action checklists. The codes may be used to review collected data in an anonymous fashion. Learners may choose any four-digit code that they will consistently remember throughout the curriculum.\nIn a separate room, administer 5-minute pretest confidence survey to learners. Upon its completion, administer 25-minute pretest cognitive multiple-choice exams to learners.\nHave learners report to a station, with one learner present at each station. Remaining students may wait in a separate room. Have learners provide their four-digit identifying code to faculty for their critical action checklist.\nHave faculty read the case stem to learner. Allow learners a maximum of ten minutes per station to work through a scenario. Do not administer feedback during case. At the conclusion of the scenario, dismiss learners to return back to their separate room.\nHave faculty fill out critical action checklists for each learner upon completion of each case. Rotate learners through all stations individually until all learners have completed all stations. Distribute supplemental readings to learners via paper or email.\n2. Day 2 – Curriculum and Educational Intervention\nSet up five stations with human-patient simulators, breathing simulators, ventilators, and monitors as described above.",
    "Assign each station one of the following topics: ARDS, atelectasis secondary to mucus plugging, pneumothorax, altered mental status secondary to drug overdose, and dynamic hyperinflation. Arrange learners in groups of two or three people. Assign one faculty member to each station.\nAllow each team 10 min to work through a case scenario. Give faculty 35 min to provide feedback and bedside instruction. Rotate learners through the remaining four stations.\n3. Day 3 – Post-testing Evaluation\nPrint critical action checklists, posttest confidence surveys, post-test cognitive multiple-choice exams. Set up three stations with human-patient simulators, breathing simulators, ventilators, and monitors as described above. Assign each station one of the following topics: ARDS, atelectasis secondary to mucus plugging, pneumothorax.\nUpload vital signs, portable chest X-ray images, electrocardiograms, and arterial blood gas measurements for each patient case to each respective patient monitor (e.g., autoPEEP images are uploaded to the human-patient simulator designated as the autoPEEP patient).\nSet out critical actions checklists at each station for each learner. Assign one faculty member to each station. Administer 5-minute post-test confidence survey and 25-minute posttest cognitive multiple-choice exam.\nHave learners report to a station, with one learner present at each station. Remaining students may wait in a separate room. Have learners provide their four-digit identifying code to faculty for their critical action checklist.\nHave faculty read the case stem to learner. Allow learners a maximum of ten minutes per station to work through a scenario. Do not administer feedback during case. At the conclusion of the scenario, dismiss learners to return back to their separate room.\nHave faculty fill out critical action checklists for each learner upon completion of each case. Rotate learners through all stations individually until all learners have completed all stations. Administer 10-minute post-curriculum survey to all learners.",
