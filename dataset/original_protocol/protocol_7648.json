    "Culturing HRMECs: thawing HRMECs from freezing vial Order cryopreserved HRMECs from Cell Systems. These HRMECs are isolated from normal, healthy donor tissue and supplied at passage 3 (<12 cumulative population doublings). A certificate of analysis is provided with each vial, which contains approximately 1 × 106 cells. After obtaining the cryopreserved cells from the vendor, they should be immediately stored in liquid nitrogen. We usually thaw the HRMECs by adding one frozen cell vial into one BioCoat T-25 and one T-75 flask. All steps are done in a laminar flow hood under aseptic conditions.Rehydration of BioCoat Collagen-coated T-25 and T-75 tissue culture flasks:The BioCoat flasks are stored at 4 °C. Take the packet containing the flasks out and allow them to come to room temperature prior to use. Warm some bicarbonate-based serum-free culture medium (such as RPMI-1640) in a 37 °C water bath. Add 5 mL of warm bicarbonate-based serum-free culture medium (such as RPMI) to the T-25 flask. Similarly, add 15 mL of warm serum-free media to the T-75 flask. We usually use warm RPMI-1640 for rehydrating the flasks. Allow the flasks to rehydrate for 2 h in a humidified tissue culture incubator maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. After 2 h, aspirate the media from the flask, taking care not to disrupt the collagen coating.Add 10 mL of EGM-2 complete media to the rehydrated T-25 flask. Similarly, add 20 mL of EGM-2 complete media to the rehydrated T-75 flask. Important:  Cryopreserved cells are very delicate. The HRMECs are typically cryopreserved in complete EGM-2 media supplemented with 5% DMSO. Thaw the vial in a 37 °C water bath by swirling the vial gently until the contents are completely thawed. Each vial contains approximately 1 × 106 cells at passage 3 (<12 cumulative population doublings).",
    "As soon as the vial is thawed, immediately remove the vial from the water bath, wipe it dry, and rinse it with 70% ethanol. Subsequently, transfer the vial inside a laminar flow hood. Remove the cap, being careful not to touch the interior threads with gloved fingers.Using a 1 mL sterile serological pipette, gently dispense the contents of the vial into the rehydrated BioCoat T-25 and T-75 flasks containing EGM-2 complete media (Figure 1) at the recommended seeding density of 6,000 cells/cm2. Rinse the freezing vial with 1 mL of EGM-2 complete medium and add it to the tissue culture flasks. Important:  Do not centrifuge the cells from the freezing vial. The DMSO present in the cryopreserved cells will get diluted in the EGM-2 complete media present in the flask. Therefore, the cells will not be harmed by the DMSO.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4899/bioprotoc-13-23-4899-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic diagram representing the establishment of human retinal microvascular endothelial cell (HRMEC) cultures from cryopreserved cells. The flasks should be placed flat (horizontally) in the cell culture incubator.Return the tissue culture flasks to the humidified tissue culture incubator maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Do not disturb the culture for at least 24 h after the culture has been initiated. After 24 h, aspirate and discard the media in the flask and add fresh EGM-2 complete media to remove any residual DMSO and unattached cells. A healthy culture will display cobblestone morphology and non‐granular cytoplasm [9, 10].Culturing HRMECs: maintenance and subculturing of HRMEC cultures Culture HRMECs to approximately 70%–80% confluence. The media should be replenished once every three days.Rehydrate the required number of BioCoat T-75 flasks (see Section A, Step 2).Rinse the cells with DPBS. Use 5 mL of DPBS for T-25 and 10 mL of DPBS for T-75 flasks.Add 3 mL of 0.",
    "25% Trypsin/EDTA solution into the T-75 flask (in the case of T‐25 flask, use 2 mL).Gently rock the flask to ensure that the cells are covered by Trypsin/EDTA solution. Incubate the flask at 37 °C incubator for 1–2 min or until cells are completely rounded up (monitored with inverted microscope). Gently tap the side of the flask to fully detach the cells if necessary.Add 2 mL of FBS to the T-75 flask (use 1 mL for a T-25 flask) to neutralize the Trypsin-EDTA. Using a 5 mL serological pipette, gently rinse the flask completely and transfer the cells in a 15 mL centrifuge tube.Rinse the growth surface of the flask with 10 mL of DPBS to collect the remainder of the detached cells and combine in the same 15 mL centrifuge tube from Step B6. Close and examine the flask under an inverted microscope to verify that the cell harvesting is complete. There should be less than 5% cells (of the initial density of the flask) remaining in the flask.Centrifuge the harvested cell suspension at 800× g for 5 min at room temperature using a benchtop centrifuge. Remove (aspirate) the FBS/DPBS liquid from the pellet. Gently flick the tube to dislodge the cells and resuspend them in 1 mL of EGM-2 complete medium.Count the cells using a hemocytometer and then dispense the required volume of cell suspension into the hydrated T-75 flask as recommended in see Section A, Steps 5–6. Return the flasks back to the cell culture incubator maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Working with Matrigel The Matrigel is aliquoted in ice-cold sterile Corning freezing vials and stored at -70 °C.Before starting the MDA, the required amount of Matrigel should be thawed overnight at 4 °C. The Matrigel is always kept on ice during the experiment.",
    "Matrigel is a liquid at 4 °C, and it polymerizes into a gel-like solid at 37 °C. We recommend that plasticware and reagents should be kept ice cold while handling the Matrigel.The thawed Matrigel is a thick, viscous liquid. Pipette tips should be trimmed at the tip (to increase the diameter of the tip) to transport the Matrigel in/out of the freezing vials. All microcentrifuge tubes and pipette tips should be kept ice cold while handling the Matrigel to avoid polymerization. In our laboratory, we use ice-cold serum-free RPMI-1640 as a cooling media. All pipette tips are dipped into the ice-cool media to chill them down before using them to handle Matrigel.Matrigel Duplex Assay Day 1 The assay is set up in an 8-well chamber slide. Before starting the experiment, draw the schema of the assay (Figure 2). The region (with the checkered pattern) of the right side of the chamber slide is used to lift and transport the slide.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4899/bioprotoc-13-23-4899-g002.jpgFigure 2. Schema of the Matrigel Duplex Assay All experiments are performed with HRMECs between passage 3–7. The entire experiment is performed in a laminar flow hood under aseptic conditions.Grow the HRMECs cells to approximately 70%–80% confluence (in hydrated collagen-coated BioCoat T-75 flasks (please see Section A, Step 2 on instructions for rehydration of flasks) in complete EGM-2 media in a humidified environment at 37 °C (with 5% CO2) in a cell culture incubator.Wash the HRMECs once with DPBS and trypsinize the flask using 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA.Add 2 mL of FBS to neutralize the trypsin and transfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL tube. Rinse the flask with DPBS and transfer the solution to a 15 mL tube.Gently spin down the cells at 800× g for 5 min at room temperature in a benchtop centrifuge.",
    "Aspirate the media and resuspend the HRMECs in EGM-2 containing 4% FBS.Count the cells using the Corning cell counting chamber. Adjust the concentration of the cells to 1.6 × 107 cells/mL (using EGM-2 media containing 4% FBS) in a sterile 5 mL microfuge tube. This tube is labeled as TUBE A. The stock solution of PP2 (10 mM) should be diluted to a concentration of 200 µM (see Recipes) in basal EBM-2 media in a sterile microfuge tube. The PP2 is prepared at 20× working concentration and labeled as PP2-20X. The PP2-20X is the concentration of PP2 used to set up the MDA. The final concentration of PP2 to be used for the MDA is 10 µM.In a separate 1.5 mL microfuge tube, mix the cells (from TUBE A) with PP2-20X at the ratio of 10:1 (v/v). This dilutes the PP2-20X to a concentration of 20 µM. As an example, you may add 45 µL of cell suspension (from TUBE A) to 5 µL of the PP2-20X. Gently flick the tube so that the drug mixes well with the cell suspension. Do not vortex because this will shear (and lyse) the cells. Therefore, the new concentration of PP2 is 20 µM. This tube is labeled as TUBE B. The vehicle for the PP2-20X is 2% DMSO (hereafter referred to as VEH-20X, see Recipes). Just like in the previous step, mix the cells (from TUBE A) with VEH-20X at the ratio of 10:1 (v/v). Do not vortex because this will shear (and lyse) the cells. Therefore, the new concentration of the vehicle is now 0.2% DMSO. This tube is labeled as TUBE B-VEH. Keep a few empty 1.5 mL microfuge tubes on ice to chill them down.",
    "Combine the cells with Matrigel at a ratio of 1:1 in an ice-cold microfuge tube. For example, mix 20 µL of Matrigel with 20 µL of cell suspension (taken from TUBE B). Mix the cells with the Matrigel by flicking the tube. Do not allow the tube to warm up and do not generate air bubbles in the Matrigel–cell suspension while flicking. The final PP2 concentration in the tube is now 10 µM. This tube is labeled as TUBE C.Similarly, 20 µL of HRMECs (treated with 0.2% DMSO) are mixed with 20 µL of Matrigel in a separate microfuge tube. The final concentration of vehicle in the tube is now 0.1% DMSO. This tube is labeled as TUBE C-VEH. Table 1 describes the tubes A, B, and C in detail.Table 1.

    "Take a chamber slide out of the packet. Place the chamber slide in a dish over a piece of tissue paper inside the laminar flow hood. Use a Kimwipe or a sterile gauze pad to prevent the chamber slide from sticking to the surface of the hood, as this may cause a disruption of the primary Matrigel layer during the transfer to the incubator.Take 6 µL of the cell suspension from TUBE C and plate it as a drop in the center of the chamber slide. Each sample is assayed in duplicate. A similar process is followed for TUBE C-VEH. The chamber slide is then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a humidified cell culture incubator with 5% CO2. Below is a schematic representation of the chamber slide with the drop in the middle of the well (Figure 3). We also provide a photograph of the chamber slide with the drop in the middle of the well (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4899/bioprotoc-13-23-4899-g003.jpgFigure 3. Schematic diagram of the chamber slide with the drop in the middle of the well Note: The drop does not need to be exactly at the geometric center of the slide. The important fact to remember is that it should be centered enough so that the cells can invade radially into the secondary layer. Even if the drop (the primary layer) is slightly off center, that would be okay for the assay. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4899/bioprotoc-13-23-4899-g004.jpgFigure 4. Photograph of the chamber slide with the primary layer in the middle of the slide After 1 h, add 250 µL of EGM-2 complete media to each well. Leave the chamber slide at 37 °C (with 5% CO2) for 24 h in a cell culture incubator.Thaw a vial of PR-free Matrigel overnight at 4 °C.",
    "If the assay is set up as shown in the schematic diagram above (Figure 5), 1 mL of PR-free Matrigel will be required for the experiment.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4899/bioprotoc-13-23-4899-g005.jpgFigure 5.

(C) The drop is allowed to polymerize for 1 h at 37 °C (with 5% CO2) in a cell culture incubator. (D) After 1 h, 250 µL of EGM-2 complete media is added to each well.Day 2 After 24 h, dilute the PR-free Matrigel with an equal volume of EGM-2 supplemented with 4% FBS. Keep this solution on ice.Look at the chamber slide under a phase contrast microscope to confirm the presence of a network of retinal endothelial cell tube–like structures within the primary Matrigel layer (the drop).Aspirate the medium from the chamber slide. Use a pipette to gently remove the medium from the cell without disturbing the drop at the center of the chamber slide.Gently overlay 200 µL of the 1:1 solution of phenol red-free Matrigel (diluted in EGM-2 supplemented with 4% FBS) over the drop. Figure 6 represents a schematic diagram of the chamber slide. The pink color drop represents the primary layer of Matrigel, and the light grey region (around the pink drop) represents the secondary layer comprised of phenol red–free Matrigel. A side view of the chamber slide is provided in Figure 7. The chamber slide is incubated at 37 °C for 1 h (with 5% CO2) in a cell culture incubator. After 1 h, add 250 µL of EGM-2 complete media to each well. Leave the chamber slide at 37 °C for 24 h in a cell culture incubator.",

The angiogenic tube–like structures (from the HRMECs in the primary Matrigel layer) should be clearly seen invading radially into the secondary Matrigel layer. Photograph three independent fields (at 10× magnification) for each sample for quantitative analysis.Processing the images using Adobe Illustrator and ImageJ The figure shown below shows the representative images obtained from the MDA. The black arrows indicate the sprouting angiogenic HRMEC tube–like structures, which have invaded the secondary Matrigel layer from the primary layer (Figure 8).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4899/bioprotoc-13-23-4899-g008.jpgFigure 8. Representative photographs obtained from the Matrigel Duplex Assay (MDA). The black arrows indicate the angiogenic tube–like structures invading into the secondary layer.Open the images in Adobe Illustrator 2023. Using the pen curvature tool, draw a dotted line across the interface between the two layers. A representative image with the dotted lines is shown below (Figure 9).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20231116/20231116191538_6388.jpgFigure 9.",
