    "All mouse experiments were carried out in accordance with University of Michigan guidelines covering the humane care and use of animals in research. All animal procedures used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Michigan (Protocol #PRO00007715).\n1. Tissue Preparation\nPreparation of embryonic tissues \nPrepare one 10 cm dish and several 3.5 cm dishes containing phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and one 12-well culture plate containing 2 mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS in each well for each pregnant mouse. Place all Petri dishes and the plate on ice.\nNOTE: Handle 4% PFA in a fume hood.\nDissect embryos from pregnant mice in ice-cold PBS with forceps and scissors as previously described14.\n\t\t\nBriefly, euthanize a pregnant mouse with CO2, grab the skin below the center of the belly with forceps and cut through the skin only, then gently pull at the skin to separate it from the underlying the abdominal muscle wall.\nNext, cut into the abdominal cavity following the same line of the skin incision. Remove the uterus containing a string of embryos and remove the embryos by gently cutting away the uterine wall. The extraembryonic tissues such as the yolk sac and amnion will be removed.\nCut and isolate head from each embryo.\nTransfer each head into each well of a 12-well plate containing 4% PFA with a plastic transfer pipette or forceps. Fix samples in 4% PFA at 4 °C for 4 h. Rinse samples in PBS at 4 °C with gentle shaking for 12 h.",
    "NOTE: For embryos younger than embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5), fix embryo heads with 4% PFA directly after isolation. For embryos at E16.5 or later, remove to discard skin and adipose tissue from the heads and rinse several times in ice cold PBS before fixation.\nCryoprotect heads.\n\t\t\nTransfer each head into a new 12-well plate containing 2 mL of 30% sucrose in PBS using a plastic transfer pipette or forceps. Agitate gently at 4 °C until the head sinks to the bottom of the dish.\nEmbed heads.\n\t\t\nTransfer the cryoprotected head into a mold containing Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound. Equilibrate samples in OCT for several minutes. Adjust the location and direction of samples with forceps.\nPlace the mold on dry ice to freeze. Store resulting cryomolds in a plastic bag at -80 °C until ready for cryosectioning.\nNOTE: The trimmed side of the samples must face the bottom of the embedding mold.\nPreparation of postnatal undecalcified hard tissues\nEuthanize at 3 week or 3 month old mouse with CO2. Remove the skin and adipose tissues. Cut and isolate the head or long bones from the mouse.\nFix and cryoprotect the head or long bone of mice as described in steps 1.1.3–1.1.4.\nEmbed in 8% gelatin in a similar manner as step 1.1.5. Keep the cryomolds in a plastic bag at -80 °C until cryosectioning.\nNOTE: Decalcification is not necessary here. To prepare 8% gelatin, mix 8 g of gelatin with 100 mL of PBS and boil using a microwave. Be aware that the mixture boils over easily.\n2. Cryosectioning\nSet cryostat temperature to -18 °C for soft tissues embedded in OCT or -25 °C and lower for undecalcified hard tissues embedded in gelatin. Keep samples in the cryostat chamber for about 30 min to equilibrate to the cryostat temperature.",
    "Expel the block from the cryomold. Freeze the block onto the specimen chuck (tissue holder) via mounting with an OCT drop. Keep the trimmed side of the sample furthest from the chuck (facing the operator).\nLoad the block-mounted chuck onto the cryostat object holder. Adjust the blade holder to make the angle of the blade 3°–5° relative to the sample.\nCollect 10 µm sections onto coated microscope slides. Dry sections completely at RT, then store them at -80 °C.\n3. Histological Staining and Microscopic Imaging\nImmunofluorescence staining\nTake out slides from -80 °C. Keep slides at RT for 1 h to airdry sections. Rinse slides in 0.1% PBST (0.1% Polyethylene glycol tert-octylphenyl ether in PBS; see Table of Materials) three times for 5 min each to wash out OCT and permeabilize sections.\nOptionally, perform antigen retrieval (optional).\n\t\t\nPreheat citrate buffer (10 mM sodium citrate pH 6) in the staining dish with steamer or water bath to 95–100 °C. Immerse slides in the citrate buffer, incubate for 10 min.\nTake the staining dish out from steamer or water bath to RT. Cool the slides at RT for 20 min or longer15.\nNOTE: As alternatives, use Tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris base, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 9.0) or EDTA buffer (1 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0) for heat-induced antigen retrieval. Use a pressure cooker, microwave, or water bath for heat-induced antigen retrieval, in addition to the hot steamer. An enzyme-induced antigen retrieval using trypsin or pepsin is another alternative. Optimize the concentration and treatment time of enzymatic retrieval to avoid damaging sections. Optimize the antigen retrieval method for each antibody/antigen combination.",
    "Incubate each slide with 200 μL of blocking solution (5% donkey serum diluted in 0.1% PBST) at RT for 30 min, then remove the blocking solution without rinse.\nIncubate each slide with 100 μL of primary antibody or antibodies diluted in blocking solution for 1 h at RT or O/N at 4 °C. Rinse slides with PBS three times for 10 min each at RT.\nIncubate each slide with 100 μL of secondary antibody diluted in blocking solution for 1 h at RT. Rinse slides in PBS three times for 10 min each at RT. Protect slides from light.\nMount slides.\n\t\t\nAdd two drops of anti-fade medium with DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) on the slide. Then cover with a coverslip.\nStore at 4 °C in dark until ready to image.\nNOTE: As an alternative, label the nuclei with DAPI or Hoechst 33324 dye diluted 1:2,000 in PBS at RT first, then mount with glycerol.\nTerminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining.\nNOTE: Double-stranded DNA with 3’-hydroxyl termini (3'OH DNA termini) will form during apoptosis in the cell. Here, we provide a protocol that label the free 3'OH DNA termini in situ via labeling DNA fragments with the digoxigenin-nucleotide utilizing terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) by specific staining using a commercial kit (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nOptionally, stain sections with primary and Alexa Fluor-488 labeled secondary antibodies prior to the TUNEL staining. Rinse the slides in PBS three times for 10 min each.\nNOTE: This step is optional for a double staining of a protein and TUNEL in the same slide.\nIncubate each slide with 100 μL Proteinase K (10 µg/mL in 10 mM Tris pH 7.5 and 5 mM EDTA) for 5 min at RT. Rinse slides with PBS three times for 10 min each at RT.",
    "NOTE: Adjust the incubation time and temperature of Proteinase K for each tissue type. For 10 µm sections of embryo heads fixed in 4% PFA, incubate for 5 min at RT. In addition to the method using Proteinase K, use alternative treatments as needed, including (1) freshly prepared 0.1% Polyethylene glycol tert-octylphenyl ether, 0.1% sodium citrate, 10 min at 37 °C; (2) 0.25%–0.5% Pepsin in HCl (pH 2) or 0.25% trypsin, 10 min at 37 °C; and (3) microwave irradiation with 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 6).\nApply 200 μL of blocking solution (5% donkey serum diluted in 0.1% PBST) to each slide, incubate at RT for 30 min, tap off the blocking solution without rinse.\nApply 50 µL of the equilibration buffer supplied by the kit to each slide at RT for at least 10 s. Tap off the buffer without rinse.\nPrepare reaction mixture (working strength TdT enzyme) by mixing TdT Enzyme with the reaction buffer supplied by the kit at the ratio of 3:7. Apply 50 µL of the reaction mixture to each slide, and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h. Tap off the buffer without rinsing.\nApply 200 µL of the stop buffer (1:30 diluted in ddH2O) supplied by the kit to each slide, then incubate at RT for 10 min. Rinse slides with PBS three times for 10 min each.\nLabel with Rhodamine antibody.\n\t\t\nApply 50 µL of pre-warmed (RT) anti-digoxigenin conjugate (rhodamine) (1:1 diluted in blocking solution) to each slide. Incubate at RT for 30 min in dark.\nRinse slides with PBS three times for 10 min each. Mount slides as step 3.1.6.\n4. Imaging Acquisition",
    "Use positive controls (tissues positive for the target antigen) to check the signal labeling and negative controls (omit the primary antibody, isotype control, or tissues negative for the target antigen) to evaluate the background of images under the fluorescent microscope.\nSet the equipment and camera conditions (exposures and other general settings) for imaging based on the signal intensity of negative and positive controls.\nNOTE: These conditions vary by (1) cameras and microscopes used for imaging, (2) antibodies, and (3) tissues for each experiment. Common conditions used for craniofacial tissues are ISO 200 with an exposure time ranging from 1/100 s to 1 s depend on the quality and specificity of antibodies. Appropriate magnifications vary depending on the size of the samples and purpose of experiments.\nAcquire images with conventional epifluorescence microscope or confocal microscope. Acquire images (including those of corresponding controls) in the same conditions for each color channel. Save images with the same format (tiff is best to preserve information).\n5. Fluorescence Quantification\nNOTE: Statistically comparing the staining between different groups will be more informative in many cases. With the immunofluorescence images, quantify the relative level of the protein by measuring signal density, counting positive cells, or calculating positive areas. For statistical analysis, the minimum number of biologically independent samples is 3. A typical method is to generate at least three sections from each sample and take images for at least three representative areas in each section.\nQuantification of fluorescence intensity using ImageJ\nOpen the software, and use Analyze > Set Measurements to check that only Area and Integrated Density are selected. Use File > Open to open images to be analyzed.",
    "Use Toolbar to select either the square or circle icon on the far left. Select the area to be analyzed on the image using the selection tool. Use Analyze > Measure to get the readout of the selected area and integrated density in the Results window. Select a region next to a positive cell that has no fluorescence to read out the background.\nRepeat step 5.1.2 to analyze other images. Adjusted the area to be analyzed to match with that of the first image.\nCopy all the data in the Results window and paste into a spreadsheet when finished analyzing.\nCalculate the corrected fluorescence intensity (CTCF) as Integrated Density — (Area of selected cell x Mean fluorescence of background readings). Compare the difference of the corrected total cell fluorescence between samples and make a graph.\nQuantification of the positive cell number of fluorescent images using ImageJ\nManual cell counting.\n\t\t\nUse ImageJ > Plugins > Analysis to install the Cell Counter plugin.\nUse File > Open to open images to be analyzed. Use Plugins > Analysis > Cell counter to open the Counter window and the Results window.\nNOTE: Cell counter does not work on stacks. For counting stacks, plugin Plot Z Axis Profile, then use Image > Stacks > Plot Z Axis Profile to monitor the intensity of a moving ROI using a particle tracking tool. This tool can be either manual or automatic.\nClicking one of buttons at the bottom of the Counter window to initiate counting. Click directly on a cell/object to be count until finishing.\nClick the Results button in the Count window. The total number of cells counted will be shown in the Results window. Save the result log as spreadsheet and analyze.\nAutomated cell counting.",
    "Use File > Open to open images to be analyzed. Convert the RGB image into a grey scale image before proceeding.\nUse Image > Adjust > Threshold to select all the areas that need to be counted.\nUse Analyze > Analyze Particles to get the number of cells/particles. Set a range of the valid particle size (e.g., 100-Infinity) instead of the default of 0-Infinity to count cells/particles within a specific range. Save the result log as spreadsheet and analyze.\n\t\t\tNOTE: To get other information from the image, besides area, go to Analyze > Set Measurements and select the box next to the information needed.\nSubscription Required.
