Time, media composition, and culturing conditions can be altered, depending on the cell line being used and the virus being tested.\nWash a confluent 10-cm dish (or T75 flask) of MA-104 Clone 1 cells with 10 mL of PBS and rock gently to wash the entire monolayer thoroughly.\nAdd 1.5 mL of 0.05% trypsin EDTA and place the container of cells back in the incubator for 3–5 min.\nNeutralize the trypsin with 8.5 mL of EMEM containing 10% FBS.\nCount viable cells using trypan blue and an automated cell-counter or manually using a hemocytometer.\nDilute to 1.5 × 105 live cells per mL in growth media and transfer 2 mL to each well of a 6-well plate (3 × 105 live cells plated per well).",
    "Note: The number of wells needed depends on the experiment being performed. For instance, if vRNA production at 24 h is to be assessed, two conditions would be plated: one mock-treated and one virus-exposed. If vRNA production over a time course is to be assessed, ensure that each time point (1, 12, 24, and 48 h) has a paired mock condition (8 total wells). Furthermore, the number of cells plated will vary depending on the cell line being used. The goal is to plate cells to become confluent the next day. We find that plating 1 × 105 to 1 × 106 cells is ideal for RNA FISH-Flow, as some cells may be lost during sample processing.\nIncubate cells overnight at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nExposure of cells to virus\nTiming: Approximately 2 h\nThis major step describes infection of target cells with simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). These conditions can be adjusted as necessary to accommodate testing of any RNA virus of interest.\nRemove SHFV from −80°C storage and thaw at ambient temperature.\nIn a sterile microfuge tube, dilute virions into 300 μL of serum-free EMEM to achieve the desired multiplicity of infection (MOI). If exposing multiple wells of a 6-well plate, scale this volume up, as needed.\nNote: We use an MOI of 3 and 0.03 for single-step and multi-step growth curves, respectively. If assessing early events prior to vRNA replication is of interest (i.e., invading virions), an MOI >10 should be used.\nDiscard all growth media from the 6-well plate containing the monolayer of MA-104 cells.\nWash the plate one time with PBS.\nRemove the PBS wash and add 300 μL of media with diluted virions (or media alone for mock treatment).\nRock the plate gently and return it to the incubator.",
    "Continue to rock the plate gently every 15 min for 1 h to ensure that the cells do not dry up.\nAspirate the virion inoculum (or media alone for mock) from each well.\nCritical: To minimize plastic waste, remove the virion inoculum without changing tips between wells. If multiple MOIs were tested, move from the most dilute sample (low MOI inoculum) to the least dilute sample (high MOI inoculum). Additionally, remove media from the mock-treated wells first to ensure that no carry-over contamination occurs from the virus-exposed to mock-treated samples.\nWash each well with 2 mL of PBS and rock gently to thoroughly wash the entire monolayer.\nDiscard the PBS wash.\nWash and discard two more times.\nReplace the final PBS wash with 2 mL of EMEM + 2% FBS and return the plate to the incubator.\nIncubate the cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 for the appropriate time (according to the experimental design).\nFixation of cells following infection\nTiming: Approximately 2 h\nThis major step describes fixation of cells following virus exposure. The time post-exposure when the cells are processed is dependent on the question being asked. For SHFV, exposure is stopped after 1 h to assess incoming vRNA genomes. This typically requires a high MOI (>10) and has limited resolution capacity because only a few RNAs will be detected per cell. As the vRNA is replicated within cells, fluorescence detection is more easily discriminated from background fluorescence. A time course of 4–12 h enables robust detection of virus-infected cells. Longer time courses (24–72 h) can also be used to measure spread through the cell-culture monolayer.\nRemove the cell-culture media and wash the monolayer one time with PBS.\nAdd 0.5 mL of 0.05% trypsin EDTA and return the plate to the incubator.",
    "Incubate the cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 3–5 min.\nNeutralize the trypsin with 0.5 mL of EMEM containing 10% FBS.\nTransfer the cells to a sterile 1.5-mL microfuge tube.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 ×g.\nCarefully remove the cell supernatant using a pipette, being sure to not dislodge the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL of PBS.\nTransfer the cell suspension to 96-well v-bottom plates.\nAlternatives: 96-well v-bottom plates are used to enhance processivity when multiple samples are being handled simultaneously. This enables use of a multichannel pipette for the addition and removal of liquids from the samples. Alternatively, the protocol can be performed using microfuge tubes, especially when a small number of samples is being processed.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 ×g.\nDiscard the PBS wash.\nNote: Multiple incubation and washing steps are used throughout this protocol. At any point during these steps, if care is not taken, it is possible that cell pellets could accidentally be discarded. If processing samples in a 96-well plate, we suggest that, following each centrifugation, the plate is tilted and liquid is removed from the sides of the wells using a multichannel pipette—taking care not to disturb the pellet. If using microcentrifuge tubes, carefully draw liquid out from the side of the tube opposite the pellet (avoid wide-mouth pipette tips).\nUsing a multichannel pipette, add 200 μL of fixation solution (4% PFA in PBS) to each well.\nMix by gently pipetting.\nIncubate the cells in fixation solution for 10 min at ambient temperature.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 ×g.\nRemove the fixation solution and repeat the wash steps three times with 200 μL of PBS.",
    "Remove the final wash and add 200 μL of ice-cold permeabilization solution (70% ethanol diluted in diH2O) to each well.\nMix by gently pipetting.\nStore the plate at 4°C for at least 1 h.\nPause point: Cells can be stored in permeabilization solution at 4°C for up to 7 d, which is especially beneficial when processing samples at multiple time points. For instance, harvesting of different wells may be done at 4, 12, and 24 h post-exposure to visualize the kinetics of virus spread. Once the time course is complete, all permeabilized cells can be processed in one batch.\nNote: Extended permeabilization times may cause minor changes to the cells that affect their forward- and side-scatter properties. This may negatively impact downstream gating schemes used in flow cytometry; i.e., using one mock-treated well to generate gates may not be accurate if applied to several time points. To overcome this issue, harvest a mock-treated well alongside virus-exposed wells at each time point. In this way, each time point has a matched control that can be used for creating gates.\nProbe hybridization\nTiming: 2–24 h\nThis major step describes the process of probe hybridization.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 ×g.\nRemove the permeabilization solution using a pipette and gently resuspend the cells in 200 μL of wash buffer A.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 500 ×g.\nWhile the cells are being centrifuged, prepare the hybridization buffer. A total of 49.5 μL of hybridization buffer and 0.5 μL of labeled probe is needed for each well. Make a master mixture that covers all samples, including the mock-treated wells.",
    "Note: We have had similar success further diluting the probe stock 1:10 in PBS and using this diluted mixture in a hybridization reaction (0.05 μL of probe stock per well). We recommend initial testing of different probe dilutions to determine the optimum quantity needed to (1) maintain sensitivity and (2) limit background staining.\nRemove the wash buffer A and resuspend the cells in 50 μL of hybridization buffer containing the probe.\nNote: The hybridization buffer is very viscous, so take care to ensure that the cell pellet is gently but thoroughly resuspended.\nWrap the plate with parafilm and incubate protected from light at 37°C for at least 1 h.\nPause point: We have observed no difference in hybridizing cells for 1–4 h or overnight (≈16 h). Proceed with a hybridization time that is convenient for the experiment/schedule.\nRemove the plate from incubator and add 150 μL of wash buffer A to each well.\nMix by pipetting.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 650 ×g.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, carefully remove the wash solution, being sure to not dislodge the cell pellet.\nNote: From this point forward, the pellet may be easily dislodged from the plate and thus easily lost. Be very gentle with the pelleted cells. We suggest tilting the plate to draw liquid out from the sides of the wells and not near the pelleted cells, which are concentrated in the “v” of the plate wells.\nResuspend the cells in 200 μL of wash buffer A and incubate protected from light at 37°C for 30 min.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 650 ×g.\nRemove wash buffer A and resuspend the cells in 200 μL of wash buffer B.\nPellet the cells by centrifugation for 5 min at 650 ×g.",
    "Remove wash buffer B and resuspend cells in 150 μL FACS buffer.\nProceed to flow-cytometry acquisition."
