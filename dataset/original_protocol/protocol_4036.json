For digestion of brain tissue, 1 h 30 min. For myelin depletion using murine Myelin Removal MicroBeads, 75 min. For endothelial cell enrichment using CD31 murine MicroBeads, 45 min. For FACS, 1–2 h.\nFigure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A shows a detailed scheme of brain ECs isolation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/996-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. EC isolation from mouse brain\n(A) Detailed scheme illustrating isolation of ECs from brain.\n(B) Representative FACS plots for the gating strategy to sort ECs from brain based on sorting live/CD45-/CD31+ cells.\nPreparation of brain digestion buffer\nThe following protocol, describing the isolation of brain ECs, includes the use of the Neural Tissue Dissociation kit (P) (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-092-628), which allows mechanical and enzymatic dissociation of brain tissue before removal of myelin (as described previously (Vanlandewijck et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20])). Reagents of this kit need to be prepared in advance according to the manufacturer's instructions (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/neural-tissue-dissociation-kits.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/neural-tissue-dissociation-kits.html#gref]). The protocol is designed to process the entire brain (without olfactory bulb). Described volumes are optimized for the protocol and suffice for 2 (pooled) adult murine brains.\nDigestion of brain tissue\nPrepare enzyme mix 1 (mix 5.7 mL of buffer X with 150 μL of enzyme P from the Neural Tissue Dissociation kit (P) (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-092-628)) and equilibrate to 37°C.\nBefore dissecting the brain, perform transcardial perfusion via the left ventricle with ice-cold PBS at a perfusion rate of 2 mL/min for 5 min.\nRemove the brain surgically and place it in ice-cold Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM, high glucose, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#11965092) supplemented with 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#15140122).",
    "Transfer the dissected brain to a Petri dish chilled on ice and mince the tissue with a scalpel blade until no more large pieces remain. The pieces should be small enough to pass through a cut P1000 pipette tip (approx. 0.8 mm diameter).\nTransfer the brain pieces to a 15 mL conical tube with a cut P1000 pipette tip and mix them with enzyme mix 1.\nIncubate for 17 min at 37°C on a tube rotator (e.g.: HulaMixer™ Sample Mixer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#15920D)) (max. 20 rpm).\nDuring incubation prepare enzyme mix 2 (mix 60 μL of buffer Y with 30 μL of enzyme A from the Neural Tissue Dissociation kit (P)).\nTake the cell suspension from the tube rotator and add enzyme mix 2.\nMix the suspension with a Pasteur pipette by pipetting up and down (10 times).\nNote: When clogging occurs, remove the clog by tapping the tip of the Pasteur pipette against the bottom of 15 mL conical tube until the clog resolves.\nCritical: The suspension should pass through the Pasteur pipette without clogging before proceeding to the next step.\nIncubate for 12 min at 37°C with slow rotation (10 rpm) on the tube rotator (e.g.: HulaMixer™ Sample Mixer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#15920D)).\nPass the cell suspension firmly, but without creating bubbles or foam, through a 20G needle (use a 1 mL syringe). Repeat this step approximately 10 times.\nCritical: The cell suspension should pass through the needle without clogging, and no major tissue pieces should be visible after this step.\nIncubate the cell suspension for an additional 10 min at 37°C with slow rotation (10 rpm) on the tube rotator (e.g.: HulaMixer™ Sample Mixer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#15920D)).",
    "Transfer the cell suspension to a 50 mL conical tube, add 40 mL of ice-cold HBSS (containing Mg2+, Ca2+) and filter through a 70 μm cell strainer.\nCritical: From this moment on, the cell suspension should always be kept at 4°C.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant to a new 50 mL conical tube, keep the pellet at 4°C.\nRepeat steps 2n and 2o two more times for a total of three cycles of centrifugation.\nMyelin depletion using murine Myelin Removal MicroBeads\nPool the pellets from steps 2n to 2p resuspend in 3600 μL Wash Buffer and add 400 μL Myelin Removal Beads II (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-096-733).\nMix and incubate at 4°C for 15 min.\nNote: Process fast in order to avoid non-specific binding of beads at 20°C–22°C.\nAdd Wash Buffer to a total volume of 40 mL.\nCentrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C, remove the supernatant.\nDuring the centrifugation prepare 3 collection tubes and LS columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-042-401) according to the manufacturer's instructions (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/ls-columns.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/ls-columns.html#gref]) i.e., place the column in the suitable magnetic separator and prepare the column by rinsing with 3 mL of Wash Buffer.\nResuspend the pellet in 6 mL of Wash Buffer.\nAdd 1 mL of the cell suspension on each column (keep the rest of the cell suspension, ± 3 mL).\nCritical: Collect the eluent containing the cells.\nAfter the suspension has run through the column, wash the column twice by adding 1 mL of Wash Buffer once the column reservoir is empty.\nCritical: Collect eluent to the conical tube from step (3f). This fraction contains ECs.\nPrepare another 3 LS columns and repeat the procedure for the remaining sample (± 3 mL left).",
    "Centrifuge the total eluent at 300 g for 5 min, remove the supernatant.\nPool the pellets in 2 mL of Wash Buffer and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min, remove the supernatant.\nEndothelial cell enrichment using CD31 murine MicroBeads\nResuspend the pellet in an appropriate amount of Wash Buffer and add the appropriate volume of CD31 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-097-418) to the suspension according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nNote: We suggest to resuspend cells in 90 μL of Wash Buffer, determine the cell number and follow the manufacturer's instructions (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/cd31-microbeads-mouse.html?countryRedirected=1#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/cd31-microbeads-mouse.html?countryRedirected=1#gref]) i.e., for up to 1 × 107 total cells, resuspend the cells in 90 μL of Wash Buffer and add 10 μL of CD31 MicroBeads. If fewer than 1 × 107 cells are available use the same volumes as indicated above. When working with higher cell numbers than 1 × 107 cells, scale up all reagent volumes and total volumes accordingly.\nNote: In case the sample is too viscous or contains clumps, filter through a 40 μm cell strainer to prevent clogging of columns in the next steps (do not filter if not necessary).\nMix well and incubate for 20 min at 4°C.\nNote: Process samples fast in order to avoid non-specific binding of beads at 20°C–22°C.\nWash the cells by adding 3 mL of Wash Buffer and centrifuge at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C.\nDuring the centrifugation prepare collection tubes and MS columns (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-042-201) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/ms-columns.html#gref[href=https://www.miltenyibiotec.com/US-en/products/ms-columns.html#gref]) i.e., place the column in the suitable magnetic separator and prepare the column by rinsing with 0.5 mL of Wash Buffer.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 0.5 mL of Wash Buffer.\nApply the cell suspension onto the prepared MS column through a 40 μm cell strainer.",
    "Wash the MS column 3 times with 0.5 mL Wash Buffer, adding buffer each time once the column reservoir is empty.\nNote: The eluent (CD31-negative fraction) from step 4f can be used to prepare controls for FACS analysis or can be discarded if not further needed.\nRemove the MS column from the separator and place it onto a new 15 mL conical collection tube.\nPipet 1 mL Wash Buffer onto the MS column. Immediately flush out the fraction containing the magnetically labeled cells (CD31-positive fraction) by firmly applying the plunger supplied with the column.\nFACS\nCritical: Prepare all required controls for flow cytometry analysis beforehand i.e., unstained cell (US) control, viability control (VB), Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) control, isotype controls (optional), as well as the compensation controls (one for each fluorophore) for proper set up of the cytometer.\nNote: We recommend to use the cells from the final step of the isolation as controls (US, VB, FMO, isotype controls). However, if the cell number is limited, one can use the cells from, e.g.: CD31-negative fraction, to prepare the controls. For compensation controls we would recommend to use compensation beads (e.g., OneComp eBeads™ Compensation Beads, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#01-1111-41) to ensure clear fluorescence signal and sufficient compensation.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 g for 5 min, remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 500 μL Wash Buffer-based staining solution containing:\nCD31 (PECAM-1) Monoclonal Antibody (390), e.g.: CD31-FITC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#11-0311-82; 1:300).\nCD45 Monoclonal Antibody (30-F11), e.g.: CD45-PE-Cyanine7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#25-0451-82; 1:700).\nViability Dye, e.g.: eFluor 450 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#65-0863-18; 1:1000).\nStain the cells for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.\nAdd 3 mL of Wash Buffer and centrifuge the stained cells at 300 g for 5 min at 4°C, remove the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in Wash Buffer and proceed with FACS.\nSort viable, CD45-/CD31+ cells to collection tubes.\nNote: To ensure high viability of ECs, sort the ECs to an Eppendorf tube containing collection medium (10% (v/v) FBS in PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#A38401).\nFigure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B shows representative FACS plots and gating strategy of viable, CD45-, CD31+ brain ECs.\nChoroid endothelial cell isolation\nTiming: ∼5 h 30 min. For preparation of choroid digestion buffer, 30 min. For digestion of choroid tissue, 1 h 30 min. For immune cell depletion using CD45 murine MicroBeads, 45 min. For cell enrichment using CD31 murine MicroBeads, 45 min.

    "Note: We suggest to perform dissection of choroids as follows: Sacrifice mice by cervical dislocation and collect eyes by inserting scissors along the eye into the orbital cavity. Cut the four optical muscles and the optic nerve, which appear as a white cord behind the eye. Then place the eyes in PBS and remove periocular tissue under a microscope. Dissect the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-choroid-sclera complex from the enucleated eyes by peeling off the vitreous body and retina.\nTransfer dissected choroids to a 50 mL conical tube containing 5 mL of choroid digestion buffer.\nPipet the choroids vigorously using a P1000 micropipette.\nIncubate in a 37°C water bath for 30–40 min.\nDuring the incubation, pipet the choroids vigorously using a P1000 micropipette every 5–10 min.\nStop the enzymatic reaction by adding 5 mL of Wash Buffer.\nFilter the cells through a 100 μm cell strainer into a new 50 mL conical tube.\nRinse the used conical tube with an additional 3 mL of Wash Buffer and filter the suspension through the 100 μm cell strainer.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 300 g for 7 min.\nRemove the supernatant and wash the cells with 5 mL of Wash Buffer.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 g for 5 min, remove the supernatant.\nImmune cell depletion using CD45 murine MicroBeads\nResuspend the pellet in an appropriate amount of Wash Buffer and add the appropriate volume of CD45 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-052-301) to the suspension according to the manufacturer's instructions.",

For compensation controls we would recommend to use compensation beads (e.g., OneComp eBeads™ Compensation Beads, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#01-1111-41) to ensure clear fluorescence signal and sufficient compensation.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 250 g for 5 min, remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 0.5 mL Wash Buffer-based staining solution containing:\nCD31 (PECAM-1) Monoclonal Antibody (390), e.g.: CD31-FITC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#11-0311-82; 1:300).\nCD45 Monoclonal Antibody (30-F11), e.g.: CD45-PE-Cyanine7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#25-0451-82; 1:700).\nViability Dye, e.g.: eFluor 450 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#65-0863-18; 1:1000).\nStain cells for 30 min at 4°C in the dark.\nAdd 3 mL of Wash Buffer and centrifuge the stained cells at 250 g for 5 min at 4°C, remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in Wash Buffer and proceed with FACS.\nSort viable, CD45-/CD31+ cells to collection tubes.\nNote: To ensure high viability of ECs, sort the ECs to an Eppendorf tube containing collection medium (10% (v/v) FBS in PBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#A38401).\nNote: To determine the efficiency of epithelial cell depletion by EpCAM MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Cat#130-105-958) an antibody against CD326 (EpCAM) can be added to the staining panel (e.g.: CD326 (EpCAM)-PE Monoclonal Antibody (G8.8), eBioscience™ Cat#:12-5791-82; 1:500). However, we would recommend optimization of the staining. We would like to acknowledge that the EpCAM staining is optional and might influence the FACS sorting of ECs.\nFigure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B shows representative FACS plots and gating strategy of viable, CD45-, CD31+ lung ECs.\nMuscle endothelial cell isolation (m. soleus and m. extensor digitorum longus [EDL])",
    "Timing: ∼4 h 45 min. For preparation of muscle digestion buffer, 30 min. For digestion of muscle tissue, 1 h 30 min. For endothelial cell enrichment using CD31 murine MicroBeads, 45 min.

    "Note: The eluent (CD31-negative fraction) from step 18f can be used to prepare controls for FACS analysis or discarded if not further needed.\nRemove the MS column from the separator and place onto a new 15 mL conical collection tube.\nPipet 1 mL Wash Buffer onto the MS column. Immediately flush out the fraction containing the magnetically labeled cells (CD31-positive fraction) by firmly applying the plunger supplied with the column.\nFACS\nCritical: Prepare all required controls for flow cytometry analysis beforehand i.e., unstained cell (US) control, viability control (VB), Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) control, isotype controls (optional), as well as the compensation controls (one for each fluorophore) for proper set up of the cytometer.\nNote: We recommend to use the cells from the final step of the isolation as controls (US, VB, FMO, isotype controls).
