    "Preparation of fibrin carrierThaw the TISSEEL Fibrin Sealant (2-ml pre-filled syringe) at 37 °C.Prepare diluted fibrin by adding 1 ml of Sealer Protein (fibrinogen) entire contents of the syringe to 1.16 ml of fibrinogen solution (Recipe 1).Prepare thrombin mix by adding 1 ml of thrombin (entire contents of the syringe) to 9 ml of thrombin solution (Recipe 2).Prepare diluted thrombin by adding 1.5 ml of thrombin mix (from Step A3) to 25 ml thrombin solution.To one well of a 6-well plate add 0.75 ml of diluted thrombin (from Step A3). Ensure that the diluted thrombin solution covers the entire well evenly.To the same well add 0.75 ml diluted fibrin. Add dropwise to the well quickly mixing with a pipette tip. Allow gel to set at room temperature. The final concentration of fibrinogen and thrombin is ~10 mg/ml and 3 IU/ml, respectively. The gel will set in approximately 5 min. Once the gel has set proceed to the cultivation of the cells.Cultivation on a fibrin carrierSeed hair follicle stem cells derived from a dual reporter mouse at 1 x 105 cells/ml onto a fibrin carrier and cultivate for 3 days in stem cell media (Recipe 3) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. A total volume of 2 ml is used for each well. Cells can be visualized using phase contrast microscopy (Figure 1)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180515/20180515011841_1872.jpgFigure 1. Scheme showing transplant of a fibrin carrier containing bulge derived hair follicle stem cells. Discs are prepared from hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) from a dual reporter mouse cultivated for 3 days on a fibrin sheet by using the back of a pipet tip as a “cookie cutter”. Discs are then sutured to the eye of a limbal stem cell deficient mouse. Four sutures (red asterisks) are placed.",
    "Cells fluoresce red but not green as they do not yet express the corneal epithelial differentiation marker, Krt12.Total limbal stem cell deficiency (Figure 2)Anesthetize 6- to 8-week old C57BL/6 mice with ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (13 mg/kg) (Recipe 6) via intraperitoneal injection using a 28-G insulin syringe.Generate total limbal stem cell deficiency by removing the entire corneal and limbal epithelium using an Algerbrush II corneal rust ring remover with a 0.5 mm burr (Note 6). Hair follicle stem cell transplantation (see below) should immediately follow the removal of epithelial cells. Verify complete removal of corneal and limbal epithelium using fluorescein stain.Dip the tip of a fluorescein sodium ophthalmic strip in 0.9% saline for 20 times.Using a transfer pipet, add a drop of the fluorescein stain onto the eye. Let sit 30 sec.Extensively wash in 0.9% saline.Image using a fluorescent stereomicroscope.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180515/20180515012027_2966.jpgFigure 2. Scheme of limbal stem cell deficiency. An algerbrush is used to remove the entire corneal and limbal epithelium. The red circle depicts partial debridement. Fluorescein stain can be used to verify the complete removal of the epithelium. Note the absence of fluorescein stain in the partial removal (asterisk).Hair follicle stem cell transplantationPrepare ~7 mm fibrin gel containing HFSC discs by using the back of a P1000 pipet tip (see Figure 1). Place the discs into PBS (Note 5) using forceps (Figure 1).Suture an approximately 7 mm fibrin carrier containing HFSC onto the surface of a limbal stem cell-deficient mouse eye with the stem cells facing the recipient’s basement membrane. A suture was placed superiorly, inferiorly, nasally and temporally (Figure 1).Following surgical recovery, administer anti-inflammatory eye drops for the first five days followed by Avastin eye drops for the next 7 days. Eye drops should be administered once a day.",
    "Conversion to corneal epithelial cellsMice are fed doxycycline chow (1 g/kg) ad libitum until sample collection at 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks and 5 weeks.Euthanize mice and enucleate the eyes at the sample collection time points and fix in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (Recipe 4) at 4 °C overnight followed by PBS washes.Dissect the cornea using microdissection scissors.Treat the corneas with 0.2% sodium borohydride (Note 7) for 30 min at room temperature followed by washing in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Stain corneas with 4’6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1 μg/ml), mount onto a microscope slide using cover glass and Mowiol medium (Recipe 5) and visualize using a Zeiss Observer Z1 microscope with an apotome attachment."
