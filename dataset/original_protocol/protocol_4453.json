    "Prepare a PCR mix in a final volume of 15 µl: 1x PCR buffer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.02 µM of tailed-forward primer, 0.2 µM of reverse primer, 0.18 µM of fluorescence labeled (6-FAM, HEX, NED or Cy5, D2, D3) M13 primer, 0.5 U of Taq polymerase and 50 ng of DNA.   Run the following PCR program: 5 min at 94 °C; 12 cycles with 30 sec at 94 °C, 30 sec at 62 °C (touchdown of 0.5 °C / cycle for initial 12 cycles - final annealing of 56 °C for remaining 35 cycles), 30 sec at 72 °C; and a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C.   Check 3 µl of the PCR product in an agarose gel (1.5%) stained with ethidium bromide.    Restriction assay. The presence of restriction sites should be previously assessed by comparing the sequences of target samples. The search for the suitable restriction endonuclease might be carried out with the tool SNP2CAPS (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/snp2caps/[href=http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/snp2caps/]) (Thiel  et al., 2004) or using the web tool NEB cutter (http://nc2.neb.com/NEBcutter2/[href=http://nc2.neb.com/NEBcutter2/]). The prediction of restriction analysis on each fragment with the corresponding enzyme might be performed at the TAIR website (http://www.arabidopsis.org/[href=http://www.arabidopsis.org/]). Fragments larger than 600 bp should be discarded.   Place 12 µl (remaining PCR mix) of the PCR product into a PCR tube.   Add 1 U of the respective restriction enzyme, together with the specific buffer.   Incubate in a heat block, bath or oven at the adequate temperature, according to the instructions of enzyme suppliers, for 3 h.     Fragment analysis on ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer or Beckman Coulter CEQTM8000 Genetic Analysis System. a.Mix equal amounts of each restricted product (6-FAM, HEX, NED or Cy5, D2, D3) for multiplexing.",
    "M13-tailed products should be usualy 1/20 diluted with HPLC gradient grade water (ROTISOLV®) in a volume of 20 µl. b.Make mastermix by mixing HiDi-Formamide and the Rox-Standard for each sample – 14 µl HiDi and 0.04 µl Rox-Standard. c.Add 14 µl of mastermixes in each well ABI or Beckman PCR-plate (P/N N8010560) and 1 µl of diluted PCR-product. d.Denaturate the DNA plate for 5 min at 96 °C, and after change of buffer/water in tanks of ABI PRISM Analyzer or Beckman Coulter Analysis System, place into appliance.   Data analysis with the corresponding software (GeneMapper® 4.0 Software or GenomeLabTM GeXP Software). Only those fragments which retain the fluorescent label will be detected (Figure 1).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150519/20150519190029_8496.jpg Figure 1. Schematic illustration of the expected results after analysis on capillary electrophoresis systems using the CAPS fluorescence-based multiplexing protocol. A. Digestion of labeled PCR products from two homozygous cultivars (a/a) and (b/b) and from the corresponding heterozygous F1 generation (a/b). B. Separation of digested products on agarose gel. C. Separation of digested products on capillary electrophoresis systems; only those fragments which are detected on the genetic analyzer are represented."
