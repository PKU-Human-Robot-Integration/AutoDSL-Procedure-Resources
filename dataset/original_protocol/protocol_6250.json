    "Generate sense and anti-sense cDNA probesIdentify a unique 200-250 bp region in the cDNA sequence of the gene of interest that will be detected by in situ probe and design standard PCR primers for that DNA fragment.Obtain nematode RNA and synthesize cDNA as described (Casavant et al., 2017).Follow the standard PCR protocol for the DNA polymerase (e.g., Taq polymerase) to amplify desired gene fragment from nematode cDNA. Verify a single PCR product by running a small amount on a 1% DNA agarose gel and purify it using commercially available PCR purification kit.Set up two independent asymmetric PCR reactions with DIG DNA Labeling Mix (1 mM dATP, 1 mM dCTP, 1 mM dGTP, 0.65 mM dTTP, 0.35 mM DIG-dUTP) to separately synthesize sense (negative control) and anti-sense cDNA probes as follows: X µl     PCR template from A3 (20 ng)4 µl     5x Taq Buffer2 µl     DIG DNA Labeling Mix4 µl     10 µM Forward primer (sense probe) OR Reverse primer (anti-sense probe)1 µl    Taq polymeraseX µl     ddH2OTotal volume 20 µlRun the following program in a PCR cycler as:95 °C – 30 s95 °C – 15 s60 °C – 30 s (temperature might be adjusted depending on the primers) 68 °C – 90 s (repeat b-c 35 times)68 °C – 5 min Check your DIG-labeling PCR step, by running a small amount of labeled probes on the 1% DNA agarose gel site-by-site with the original PCR template. The labeled probes should show an increase in molecular mass compare with unlabeled DNA due to the incorporated DIG (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190917/20190917210633_2547.jpgFigure 1. DNA 1% agarose gel to check DIG-labeling PCR step. Lane 1–PCR template, Lane 2–DIG-labelled sense negative probe synthesized with Forward primer, and Lane 3–DIG-labeled anti-sense probe synthesized with Reverse primer. Both DIG-labeled probes have increased molecular mass due to incorporation of DIG.",
    "Purify DIG-labeled probes with commercially available PCR purification kit and store them at  -20 °C until needed.Fixation–Day 1Collect nematode juvenilesFor pre-parasitic juvenilesHatched J2s nematodes as described previously (Casavant et al., 2017).Spin down freshly hatched J2s nematodes by centrifugation in 15 ml glass tubes (150 x g for 5 min, 4 °C) and remove supernatant.For parasitic juvenilesInfect potato plants with G. pallida cysts (~ 10 cysts/6-inch pot) as described previously (Dandurand and Knudsen, 2016). At the desired infection stage, gently pull the infected root system from the soil and rinse it with water to remove larger soil particles.Cut roots into 2 cm long sections, place in a blender, cover with water, and blend 5 times for 2 s at the low setting.To separate nematode juveniles from root debris, pour the blended root-nematode suspension through a series of sieves (2.8 mm, 500 μm, 250 μm, 90 μm, 20 μm). Nematodes will be collected on the last 20 μm sieve.Note: Re-blend larger roots and repeat this step if needed. To remove small soil and root residue, purify the nematodes by sucrose gradient centrifugation.1)Prepare 50% w/v sucrose solution and cool at 4 °C.Note: Sucrose solution can be made a day earlier and stored overnight at 4 °C. 2)In 15 ml glass tubes add 5 ml of cold 50% sucrose, then gently overlay it with 5 ml of the collected nematode solution.3)Spin down tubes for 10 min at 1,250 x g at 4 °C (acceleration and break set to “zero”). Nematodes will accumulate at the water-sucrose solution border, whereas, small soil particles and root residues will pellet on the bottom of the tube (Figure 2).4)Collect the nematode layer with P1000 pipette and wash nematodes 5 times with water on the 25 μm sieve to remove sucrose. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190917/20190917210714_1529.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Purification of parasitic nematodes through sucrose gradient centrifugationTransfer nematodes (10,000 pre-parasitic J2s or > 100 parasitic worms) to a 1.5 ml nonstick microcentrifuge tube.Wash twice by resuspending nematodes in 1 ml of water and then centrifuge them at 6,000 x g for 2 min.Remove as much water as possible and resuspend nematodes in 1 ml of Fixation Buffer.Fixate nematodes by lying tubes flat for 18 h at 4 °C, then move samples to room temperature and incubate for additional 4 h.Cutting of nematodes, permeabilization and hybridization–Day 2Wipe everything down with RNase wipes to protect RNA.Centrifuge nematodes (6,000 x g for 2 min), remove supernatant and resuspend nematode pellet with 200 μl of 10-fold diluted (in M9 buffer) Fixation Buffer.Spread ~70 μl of the nematode suspension onto a glass slide and cut them using a flat razor blade until ~80% of nematodes are cut (inspect under microscope) (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190917/20190917210738_6369.jpgFigure 3. Cutting fixed nematodes. A. Cutting station. B. Nematodes before cutting. C. Nematodes after cutting. Scale bars = 100 μm.Collect chopped nematodes into a 1.5 ml nonstick microcentrifuge tube by gently rinsing a glass slide with 10-fold diluted Fixation Buffer, and repeat Step C3 until all nematodes are cut.Spin down nematodes (6,000 x g for 2 min) and remove supernatant.Wash nematodes twice by resuspending in 500 μl of M9 buffer and then centrifuging at 6,000 x g for 2 min.Add 500 μl of proteinase K solution (0.5 mg/ml in M9 buffer) and carry out permeabilization on a rotator for 30 min at room temperature. For nematodes of parasitic stages, permeabilization time should be increased to 45-60 min.Spin down the sample and wash the nematode pellet twice with 500 μl of M9 buffer (6,000 x g for 2 min). After the second wash, remove as much M9 buffer as possible.",
    "Freeze the nematode pellet on dry ice for 15 min.Re-suspend nematodes in 1 ml of cold methanol (stored at -20 °C) and incubate nematode pellet on dry ice for an additional 30 s.Spin down the nematodes at 21,000 x g for 30 s (room temperature) and remove the methanol.Re-suspend the nematodes in 1 ml of cold acetone (stored at -20 °C) and incubate the nematode pellet on dry ice for 1 min.Spin down the nematodes at 21,000 x g for 30 s and discard all but 100 μl of the acetone.Slowly, drop-by-drop, rehydrate the sample by adding 100 μl of H2O.Pre-heat the Hybridization Buffer at 50 °C.Spin down the sample and wash the nematode pellet with 500 μl of the Hybridization Buffer (6,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature). Discard the supernatant.Add 300 μl of the pre-heated Hybridization Buffer and transfer 150 μl aliquots to two 0.5 ml nonstick microcentrifuge tubes (for sense and anti-sense sample).Pre-hybridize samples for 15 min at 50 °C in the hybridization oven.MEANWHILE: denature probes for 10 min at 100 °C and place them on ice immediately to prevent re-annealing.Add separately sense and anti-sense probes to two nematode samples.Hybridize by rotating in a hybridization oven at 50 °C overnight.Note: Hybridization temperature might be adjusted depending on length and probe specificity.Washing and staining–Day 3Spin down the nematodes (6,000 x g for 2 min at room temperature) and remove the supernatant.Wash the samples 3 times each with 100 μl of Wash Buffer 1 by rotating 15 min in hybridization oven at 50 °C followed by centrifugation at 6,000 x g for 2 min.",
    "Wash the samples 3 times each with 100 μl of Wash Buffer 2 by rotating 20 min in a hybridization oven at 50 °C followed by centrifugation at 6,000 x g for 2 min (room temperature).Wash samples by resuspending them in 100 μl of Maleic Acid Buffer and then centrifuging at 6,000 x g for 2 min.Add 100 μl of Blocking Buffer and incubate for 30 min by rotating.Spin down samples (6,000 x g for 2 min), resuspend nematode pellet in 100 μl of Blocking Buffer containing the anti-DIG-AP (1 μl anti-DIG-AP/1,000 μl Blocking Buffer), and incubate while rotating for 2 h at room temperate.Wash the samples 3 times with 100 μl of Maleic Acid Buffer each by rotating for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 6,000 x g for 2 min.Wash the samples briefly with 100 μl Detection Buffer (6,000 x g for 2 min). Add 150 μl of freshly made AP Substrate Solution (3.5 μl BCIP and 3.4 μl NBT in 1,000 μl Detection Buffer) and incubate overnight without agitation at 4 °C.Imaging–Day 4Wash the nematodes twice with 100 μl 0.01% Tween-20 for 1 min (6,000 x g for 2 min) and remove the supernatant.Resuspend the nematode pellet with 50 μl 0.01% Tween-20 and apply 10 μl/slide.Cover with coverslip and seal edges with nail polish.Examine stained nematode sections under microscope."
