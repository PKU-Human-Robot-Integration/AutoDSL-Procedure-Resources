    "This protocol focuses on the SOPs used for breast, ovarian, prostate, lung, and colon cancer. All the procedures described here were approved by the Scientific Technical Committee, Ethics Committee (EC), and the Directors of Breast, Gynecology, Urology, Thoracic surgery, and Digestive System Surgery Programs. The study procedures follow the Declaration of Helsinki of 1964, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) act of 2018, and the subsequent amendments. An institutional Research Participation Agreement (RPA), derived from the GDPR act, represents the informed consent obtained from all patients to collect biological samples and personal, clinical, and genetic data. The RPA was obtained from all patients for storing, processing, and using the obtained data for scientific purposes.\n1. Prerequisites of biological samples\nCheck whether a patient meets the conditions for enrollment based on the RPA and projects protocol and provide a detailed RPA description to all patients.\n\t\nIncrease patient engagement, e.g., broadcast an educational cartoon video in waiting rooms to inform the patients about the importance and the impact of RPA. Provide gadget bookmarks to all the patients (see the freely accessible short cartoon animation at https://www.ieo.it/it/PER-I-PAZIENTI/I-diritti-del-paziente/Consensi-informati/ and https://vimeo.com/679070846).\nTrain the personnel to carry out the consent administration during each hospitalization phase and provide additional information if the patients participate in a specific study.\n\t\tNOTE: If the RPA is not signed, biological samples are not collected.\nAvoid including cases that have presented infection by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19), hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).\n2. Biobank software\nUse laboratory information management system (LIMS) software to track all biological samples. Ensure the availability of a good operating system that automatically obtains personal and clinical information at patient registration and can be integrated with medical records, administrative cases, RPA, and patient pathological data, as shown in Figure 2.",
    "Ensure the recording of the biological samples using the biobank software.\n\t\nIdentify patients using codes. Assign a unique code to each individual, which matches the medical record number (individual visit, type of patient's service).\n\t\tNOTE: During registration, the Scientific RPA is electronically updated in the operating system.\nGenerate an aliquot ID\n\t\nIndicate the year and the anatomical site or biofluid type (Table 1) from which the sample originates (Table 2), and add a progressive unique number per sample.\nFor bilateral organs, add a sequential number to distinguish the origin of the biological sample from the right or left organ. Assign the abbreviation with the suffix 1 (for the left) or 2 (for the right)-two digits.\n\t\tNOTE: For instance, a detailed ID looks like \"12-B-00100-01\", where 12 indicates the year, and B indicates the organ = breast.\nRegister with an ID for each aliquot\n\t\nTrack two macro types of biological samples: solids and liquids.\nDivide into subcategories: fresh samples and frozen samples.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63950/63950fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: A representative interface of biobank LIMS.

Sample collection\nDaily surgery plan preparation\n\t\nDetermine whether the patient has signed the RPA or not and if they are eligible.\nCheck the following conditions:\n\t\t\nVerify patient's compliance with the inclusion criteria: report any positive case of HIV, HBV, HCV, and COVID-19 in the appropriate infective risk \"RI\" field to avoid collecting biological specimens.",
    "Verify whether the patient is enrolled in a clinical trial or specific approved research project by correctly completing the Study/Project field in each patient profile.\nInform technicians if the risk of infection is unknown; discard specimens with positive results or unknown risks.\nProcess and store samples in the biobank, as presented in Figure 3.\n\t\nCollect fresh and frozen tissue samples related to patients who underwent surgery.\nCollect cytological samples, either by aspirative or esfoliative techniques, for surgically removed small lesions.\nCollect biological fluids (e.g., blood, serum, plasma, PBMC, buccal swab, urine, feces, and ascites) of patients in the prehospitalization stage, patients enrolled in clinical trials, and any other subject involved in approved screening projects.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63950/63950fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Sample hierarchy.

Blood sample collection\nCollect the patient's blood in 6 mL vacutainers containing the anticoagulant Na2 EDTA (7.2 mg, spray-dried). Register the vacutainers labeled with the number of the medical record and the episode code and process them in two different ways: fresh or frozen.\nFor fresh samples, register the blood samples in the biobank software. Label the vacutainers with the biobank ID code and deliver them to the authorized users.\nFor frozen samples stored in the biobank, prepare two Cryobank 2D coded tubes, each of 900 µL of blood (Figure 4). Register the aliquots in the biobank software, place them on a specific barcode plate, and store them in freezers (−80 °C) to ensure a constant temperature.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63950/63950fig04.jpg",

Serum sample collection\nCollect patient's blood in 6 mL vacutainer \"plastic serum tubes\" containing spray-coated silica to induce clotting. Leave the vacutainers for 3 h at room temperature (RT) to induce clotting, and then centrifuge at 828 x g for 10 min at 20 °C.\nStore serum (450 µL) in 0.5 mL Cryobank 2D coded tubes with a total of 3-4 aliquots for each sample. If the serum volume of the last aliquot is less than 450 µL, specify it as \"LEFTOVER\" during registration to track the correct amount of serum frozen.\nRegister the aliquots in the biobank software, place them on a specific barcode plate, and store them in freezers (−80 °C) to ensure a constant temperature.\n\tNOTE: The number of aliquots depends on the initial amount of whole blood taken and the amount of serum obtained.\n6. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolation\nOpen the laminar flow hood and clean it with 70% ethanol. Prepare the bag for biological waste, sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and one empty sterile 50 mL conical tube.\nPour the blood (from EDTA collection tubes) into the empty sterile 50 mL conical tube and dilute it 1:1 using sterile 1x PBS (e.g., 15 mL of blood + 15 mL of 1x PBS). Use the PBS to rinse the blood tube.",
    "Centrifuge the tubes at 400 x g for 30 min at 20 °C and process the tubes under a biohazard hood. Recover the middle white layer containing PBMCs using a Pasteur pipette and place it in a new sterile 50 mL conical tube. Add up to 45 mL of PBS to wash the PBMCs, mix, and centrifuge at 400 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Recover the pellet, resuspend it in PBS, and count the cells using disposable Burker chambers.\n\tNOTE: The volume of PBS depends on the pellet. From 15 mL of blood, ensure a resuspension volume of 2-3 mL and then a dilution of 1:10 to count. Use equation (1):\n\tMean of 3 squares × 10,000 × dilution factors × mL of resuspension volume = number of total cells    (1)\nWash the PBMCs again with PBS, mix, and centrifuge at 400 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Dilute the PBMCs at 2-3 x 106 cells/mL in freezer medium (fetal bovine serum (FBS) + 10% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]). Prepare Cryobank 2D coded tubes by transferring 1 mL of resuspended cells into each cryotube, place them in a specific cryo box, and store them at −80 °C as soon as possible.\n\tNOTE: Freezer medium is composed of FBS with sterile 10% DMSO and stored in aliquots at −20 °C for up to 6 months. Once slowly thawed at 4 °C, it must be used within 2 weeks.\n7. Plasma sample collection\nCollect the patient's blood in 6 mL vacutainers containing the anticoagulant Na2 EDTA (7.2 mg, spray-dried). Centrifuge the vacutainer containing the whole blood at 2,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to separate the plasma.",
    "Remove the upper layer of the plasma using a 3 mL Pasteur pipette, transfer to a sterile 15 mL conical sterile tube, and centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to eliminate contaminating blood cells. Transfer the plasma into 1 mL Cryobank 2D coded tubes.\nRegister the aliquots in the biobank software, place them on a specific barcode plate, and store them in a freezer (−80 °C) to ensure a constant temperature.\n8. Stool and buccal swab sample collection\nCollect feces and buccal swabs in 15 mL tubes containing the following specific solution: 50 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM NaCl, and 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.5.\nRegister the tubes in the biobank software. Label the tubes with the biobank codes.\nStore the feces and buccal swabs at 4 °C in the biobank fridge.\n9. Tissue processing\nHave tissue samples examined by a pathologist to determine whether the material that is not necessary for diagnostic procedures is sufficient for research purposes.\n\tNOTE: When the volume of tissue is less than 1.5 mm3, it is either stored in OCT or provided as a fresh sample (A) linked to a specific research request.\nWhenever possible, collect even the non-pathological counterpart (NP) of the pathological tissue (P). Place the samples in sterile cell culture Petri dishes labeled as P and NP (Figure 5). Keep the tissue on the ice at 4 °C and divide it into three parts each (A, B, and C) if enough material is available.\n\t\nFresh tissue samples (A): place fresh aliquots of P and NP tissue in tubes with the appropriate culture medium defined in each specific protocol and send them to external research units (e.g., research laboratories).",
    "OCT tissue samples (B): place fresh aliquots of P and NP tissue in cryomolds, fill them with OCT resin (10.24% polyvinyl alcohol, 4.26% polyethylene glycol, and 85.5% non-reactive ingredients), and immediately place them in a flash-freeze apparatus at −80 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: At −80 °C, OCT-embedded tissue takes from 60-150 s to freeze.\nTissue samples (C): place the remaining tissue samples in Cryobank 2D coded tubes in the flash-freeze apparatus.\nStore the plates at −80 °C.\n\tNOTE: For each frozen OCT aliquot, perform a quality check test before distribution and its usage to have a histologic evaluation, as described in section 11.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63950/63950fig05.jpg\nFigure 5: Biobank workflow for tissue samples.

Tissue freezing\nFreeze tissue quickly in isopentane vapors using a flash-freeze apparatus. Put the tissue samples in isopentane at −120 °C for 3 min and store them in the cryopreservation rooms at −80 °C.\n\tNOTE: Two methodologies are used for freezing samples of tumor and healthy tissue using flash freeze to maintain the integrity of the nucleic acids.\n11. Tissue quality control\nHouse the cryostat instrument in a refrigerated container at a temperature between −20 ° C and −40 ° C, and cut a few cryosections from the OCT block17. Perform hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining on the tissue cryosection18. Analyze the morphology of the tissue under an optical microscope19.\n\tNOTE: The sections have a suitable thickness from 3-12 µm.\n\t\nFill out a specific form (Table 3).\nTable 3: Quality control form of OCT-embedded and frozen tissue sections. Abbreviation: OCT = optimal cutting temperature. Please click here to download this Table.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63950/Table 3.xlsx]\n12. Request and retrieval of specimens for research purposes\nRequest stored aliquots:",
    "Obtain a completed form with the research project name, principal investigator (PI), pickup date, and a brief description. Run a query on the software database (DB), select the aliquot, generate a pickup list for the technicians, and check the barcode for each retrieved aliquot.\n\t\tNOTE: To obtain samples from the biobank, researchers from our institute or external collaborators (for-profit or not-for-profit) must apply using a specific form, and the project is evaluated by a technical-scientific committee and the Ethics Committee."
