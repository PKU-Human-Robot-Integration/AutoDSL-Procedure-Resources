    "All protocols were approved by the Ethical Committee of Southern Medical University.\n1. Designing an Artificial Intron\nNOTE: The artificial intron used in this work is 65 bp in length, and the sequence is 5'-GTAAGAGTCGATCGACGCGTTACTAACTGGTACCTCTTCTTTTTTTTTTGATATCCTGCAG-3'.\nPlace the HpaI restriction site on both ends of artificial intron so that HpaI digestion can release the intron from plasmids (see Figure 1A).\nPlace the two XbaI restriction sites in the intron so that XbaI digestion can be used to insert small-RNA expression sequences.\nOrder the chemical synthesis of full-length DNA sequences of the artificial intron from a DNA manufacturer. The synthetic DNA created is from cloning into a standard pUC19 plasmid.\n\tNOTE: The essential components of the artificial intron include several consensus nucleotide elements, including a 5' donor splice site (DS) with the sequence GUAAGAGU, a conserved branch-point sequence (BPS) with the sequence UACUAAC, a poly-pyrimidine tract (PPT) with the sequence UCUUC(U)10, and a 3'-acceptor splice site (AS) with the sequence GAUAUCCUGCAG (Figure 1A). Two XbaI restriction sites were introduced between the DS and BPS that can be used to insert small-RNA expression sequences. The ability to effectively splice this artificial intron from mammalian and mosquito cells has been previously confirmed14.\n2. Designing an Artificial Intronic Small RNA Expression Cassette",
    "NOTE: For overexpression or knockdown of endogenous miRNA, sequences encoding precursor miRNA or a miRNA sponge were inserted between the DS and BPS. To serve as an example, an endogenous precursor miRNA from Ae. albopictus aal-let-7 was selected to construct recombinant viral vectors for miRNA overexpression and knockdown. An anti-let-7 sponge was designed according to previously described methods15. To knock down target genes in larvae, we designed specific artificial miRNA (amiRNA) or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences using online software16,17; to serve as an example, V-ATPase subunit A mRNA (accession no. AY864912) was selected as a target gene in this study. The amiRNA will be referred to as amiVTP hereafter. All the sequences details of pre-miRNA, sponge, amiRNA, and shRNA are described in Supplemental Table 1.\nOrder the chemical synthesis of full-length cDNA sequences of the precursor miRNAs, miRNA sponges, and shRNA with XbaI restriction sites on both ends from a DNA manufacturer.\nAfter receiving the ordered DNA, spin the tubes containing DNA blocks at 10,000-14,000 x g for 1 min to ensure that all dried DNA is at the bottom of the tube.\nResuspend the dried DNA in DNase-free water to achieve a final concentration of 10 ng/µL.\nDigest the plasmid backbone and DNA sequences with XbaI at 37 °C for 1 h, and then dephosphorylate the 5' ends of the linearized plasmid backbone with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIAP) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nInactivate CIAP by heating for 60 min at 65 °C.\nRun a 1.0% agarose gel and cut the linearized backbone. Then extract the DNA from the gel slice using a gel extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\nLigate the DNA fragment into the backboneby T4 DNA ligase (5 U/µL) at 22 °C for 1 h.",
    "Transform the products of the ligation reaction from step 2.7 into competent Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells and plate on a Lysogeny Broth (LB) agar plate containing Ampicillin (at a concentration of 100 µg/mL).\nPerform the transformation through a heat shock method18, and use the appropriate E. coli strain. For example, use E. coli strain DH5α for heat shock transformation.\nPick a single colony from step 2.8 and incubate in a culture of 3 mL enriched medium containing Ampicillin (at a concentration of 100 µg/mL).\nExtract the plasmid DNA from the bacterial culture using a mini-prep kit following the manufacturer's instructions. Send the sample to a DNA sequencing company.\n\tNOTE: For overexpression or knockdown of endogenous miRNA, the sequences encoding precursor miRNA or a miRNA sponge were inserted between the two XbaI sites. All miRNA expression or sponge constructs must be shorter than 400 bp (10% of the viral genome length) due to the packaging limit of the virus19.\n3. Generating a rAeaDV Construct by Cloning a miRNA or shRNA Expression Cassette into a Plasmid Backbone\nNOTE: pUCA, an infectious clone consisting of a pUCA plasmid containing the AaeDV genome (3,981 nt)19, was kindly provided by Prof. Jonathan Carlson and has been previously described in detail11. p7NS1-DsRed expresses a non-structural protein 1 (NS1)-red fluorescent protein (DsRed) fusion protein from the p7 promoter and has been described in detail elsewhere14. A human-specific miR-941-1 precursor20 and its sponge, a scrambled shRNA (CGACGACTATCGTGCAATTTCAAGAG AATTGCACGATAGTCGTCG), were also subcloned into AaeDV as a negative control.\nLigate the pre-miRNA, sponge, shRNA or an amiVTP expression cassette into the HpaI site of the AaeDV NS1-coding region in the pUCA plasmid backbone as described in the protocol step 2.4 to 2.7.",
    "Transform the DNA into Stbl3 competent E. coli cells and select a positive clone as described in step 2.8 to 2.10.\nFollowing this, extract the rAaeDV plasmid from the bacterial cells using a maxi prep kit following the manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: Stbl3 or Stbl4 E. coli cells should be utilized for rAaeDV DNA transformation to minimize undesired ITR recombination. A maxi prep should be used to extract the rAaeDV plasmid to obtain a large quantity of DNA (>100 µg). Before generating the virus, the sequence integrity of the rAaeDV plasmid should always be analyzed by DNA sequencing21.\n4. Transfecting C6/36 Cells with rAaeDV Plasmids\nCulture C6/36 cells in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a 28 °C incubator.\nOn day 0, plate the cells in ten 25 cm2 culture flasks 18-20 h before transfection by splitting 90-95% confluent cells in a 1:2 dilution.\n\tNOTE: By day 1, the cells should reach 90-95% confluence.\nOn day 1, transfect the cells with the series of rAaeDV plasmids22.\nDilute 10 µg DNA in 600 µL of RPMI-1640 medium in a microcentrifuge tube and mix gently. Meanwhile, prepare 600 µL of RPMI-1640 medium and 25 µL of transfection reagent per transfection.\nIncubate for 5-10 min at room temperature (RT). Then, add 625 µL of the 1640- transfection reagent mixture to the 1640-plasmid DNA mixture.\nIncubate this mixture for 20-30 min at RT. Before transfection, wash the cells twice with 2 mL of RPMI-1640 medium.\nAfter the RT incubation (step 4.3.3), add the1640-transfection reagent DNA plasmid mixture to the 25 cm2 culture flask and incubate for 6 h at 28 °C.",
    "At approximately 6 h post-transfection, remove the transfection media, wash the cells twice with 5 mL of RPMI-1640 medium, and then add RPMI-1640 medium with 10% FBS.\n\t\tNOTE: rAaeDV shows high rates of infection (95%) in Ae. albopictus larvae; however, in our experience, in nearly 50% of infected larvae, the infection was restricted to primary infection sites (e.g., anal papillae and bristle cells) without dissemination23. Therefore, if there is a need to infect larvae in multiple tissues, a defective recombinant virus expressing fluorescent protein should be co-infected to enable the visualization of infection sites. For example, to produce defective recombinant virus expressing DsRed, p7NS1-DsRed should be co-transfected with a helper plasmid into C6/36 cells according to the procedure described above (the cotransfection concentration ratio should be 2:1).\n5. Harvesting rAaeDV Virions from Transfected C6/36 Cells\nHarvest the cells 5 days after transfection. Dislodge and suspend the cells in the dishes by a 5 mL glass dropper, pipetting up and down with the culture medium. Transfer all cell suspensions to sterile 15-mL tubes.\nFreeze at -80 °C or in a dry ice/ethanol bath for 30 min and then thaw at 37 °C. Vortex for 1 min. Repeat the freeze-and-thaw procedure 3 times.\nCentrifuge the sample at 4,800 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.Collect the supernatant and discard the pellet. Then, pass the supernatant through a 0.22 µm disposable syringe filter. Aliquot and store the final purified virion stocks at -80 °C.\n\tNOTE: Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles.\n6. Quantifying rAaeDV\nPrepare the DNA standards. Linearize all rAaeDV plasmids with HpaI, and purify the digested products with a gel extraction kit24.\nConstruct the absolute quantitative standard curve and measure the titer of virus according to previously described methods25.\n7. Mosquito Transduction",
    "Wash 100 1st instar Ae. albopictus larvae three times using deionized water, and then, transfer the larvae into a beaker containing 95 mL deionized water. Add 5 mL of the rAaeDV stocks (final concentration of 1.00 x 1010 copies/mL).\nIncubate for 24 h at 28 °C, wash the larvae three times using deionized water, and then transfer the larvae back to the plates and feed regularly.\nMonitor the level of target gene expression in the larvae with qPCR or Western blot (representative results are shown in Figures 3 and 4).\n\tNOTE: The fluorescence signal detection method can be used to isolate the infected larvae more precisely. For example, to detect fluorescent signals from larvae infected with recombinant virus expressing DsRed, the larvae can be placed on a concavity slide and observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope every 8 h until 2 days post-infection. Once fluorescent larvae are detected, they should be separated into individual plastic test cups to allow for subsequent continuous observation. Larvae with multiple tissues infected can be identified using this method.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
