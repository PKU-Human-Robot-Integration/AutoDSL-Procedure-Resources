    "All applicable institutional and governmental regulations concerning the ethical use of animals were followed during this study. The study was conducted under the approval id: 2015-15-0201-0061 by the Danish Animal Experiment Inspectorate. Animals were Mexican axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum, mean body mass ± STD: 12.12 g ± 1.25 g).\n1. Preparation\nPrepare axolotl for anesthesia.\nUse high quality non-chemically treated tap water. If unavailable, use 40% Holtfreter’s solution.\nDissolve 200 mg of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (benzocaine) in 3 mL of acetone. Dissolve this solution in 1 L of tap water or 40% Holtfreter’s solution.\nUse a standard Petri dish (100 mm in diameter) placed under a stereo microscope as a surgical table. Place a surgical textile cloth on the Petri dish.\nNOTE: Using a Petri dish as a surgical area enables moving and rotation of the animal without touching it, ensuring spinal stability during surgery.\nPrepare all sterile microsurgical instruments (i.e., scissors and anatomical forceps).\n2. Anesthesia\nPlace the axolotl in a container with benzocaine solution for approximately 45 min to ensure deep and stable anesthesia.\nNOTE: The given concentration of benzocaine will cause anesthesia in all sizes of axolotls.\nCheck for signs of general anesthesia within 30-45 min. These include a complete lack of gill movements, righting reflex, or response to either tactile or painful stimuli (gentle pinching of toe web).\nTo maintain anesthesia, wrap the animals in paper towels wetted in the anesthetic solution. Wet these regularly with this solution during the surgical procedure to ensure that the skin and gills are kept moist.\nRecover the animal after the surgery by placing it in a container containing fresh tap water. Observe signs of recovery, such as gill movement and regained righting reflex, within 1 h16.\n3. Microsurgical Laminectomy\nNOTE: The laminectomy is performed under a stereomicroscope.",
    "Place the animal in the prone position on the Petri dish. Wrap it in paper towels so that the tail is exposed.\nNOTE: The paper towels are excellent for ensuring stability throughout the procedure.\nIdentify the hind limbs. Make the first incision just caudal to them.\nWith a pair of microscissors, perform a vertical incision from the keel until the bony prominence of the spinous processes are felt.\nNOTE: Be very careful when grasping the keel and skin with forceps, because these easily inflict damage to the delicate skin.\nExtend the cut laterally, so the incision traverses the entire width of the tail.\nGrasp the spinous process with forceps to ensure the right depth.\nExtend the vertical incisions 1 mm below the spinous process on both sides.\nPlace the animal on one side to perform ventral and horizontal incisions as stated below.\nWith a pair of microscissors, starting from the ventral point of the vertical incision, make a horizontal incision of approximately 15 mm for animals 10-20 g in weight. Make the incision longer for larger animals, and shorter for smaller animals.\nUsing the scissors, dissect medially through the horizontal incision until the vertebral column is felt in the midline.\nRepeat steps 3.3, 3.3.1, and 3.3.2 on the other side of the animal.\nHaving dissected in the deep medial plane from both sides, dissect through the midline, thereby connecting the two horizontal incisions.\nMove the free piece of tail and keel to one side, exposing the spinous processes (Figure 1).\nFixate the tail piece using wet paper towels.\nPlace the animal in the prone position again with the head facing the surgeon’s non-dominant side.",
    "With a pair of forceps, grasp the spinous processes just caudal to the hind limbs. Apply a gentle lift both up and towards the head of the animal.\nPlace the blades of a pair of microscissors horizontal around the process and gently cut it. The lift on the process ensures that it is now removed, exposing the spinal cord.\nGrasp the spinous process just caudal to the one that was just removed and repeat steps 3.5.1 and 3.5.2.\nNOTE: This should leave an exposed spinal cord corresponding to two vertebral levels. When performing the laminectomy, a white foamy secretion often appears. The spinal cord is easily identified by its distinctive shine, along with a vessel running along the midline.\nDepending on the size of the animal, the exposed area may not be wide enough. Using two pairs of forceps, grasp the laminae on both sides of the spinal cord and twist these laterally with a gentle movement.\n4. Introducing a Contusion Type Injury (Figure 2)\nKeep the animal in the prone position.\nUse the Petri dish to transfer the animal to the trauma unit.\nHave an assistant shine a flashlight on the spinal cord.\nPlace the contusion trauma unit cylinder above the exposed spinal cord using the microadjusters on the unit. Aim through the cylinder.\nLower the cylinder until it is level with the laminae.\nAttach the falling rod to the electromagnet. Place the desired falling height adjustment cylinder on the trauma unit.\nPlace the falling rod in the cylinder.\nNOTE: For a blinded study, the surgeon should now leave the room without knowing if the animal will be assigned to an injury or a sham surgery group.\nTurn off the electromagnet. The rod falls to the exposed spinal cord.",
    "Use the height adjustment screw to lift the rod from the spinal cord.\nConfirm the injury by looking at the spinal cord through the microscope. The injured site will appear darker, and bleeding from the midline vessel will be apparent.\n5. Introducing a Sharp Injury\nNOTE: Perform these steps after 3.5.4.\nWith a pair of microscissors cut the spinal cord in a perfect vertical cut.\nRepeat the cut 2 mm to the caudal side of the body.\nNOTE: The length of the removed piece of spinal cord can be adjusted as per the study requirement. However, a 2 mm cut will be regenerable10.\nEnsure that the cuts are complete. Upon completion, feel the blades of the scissors scraping along the ventral part of the spinal canal.\nLift the 2 mm piece of spinal cord from the spinal canal.\n6. Closing the Surgical Wound\nReturn the animal to the surgical table. In a blinded study, reposition the keel so the spinal cord is not visible to the surgeon.\nKeep the animal in the prone position.\nBegin placing 10.0 nylon sutures from the most caudal part of the horizontal incision. Close the wounds in one layer.\nNOTE: Do not grasp the skin too tight, because it will inflict necrosis.\nWork towards the vertical part of the incision.\nWhen reaching the angle, turn the Petri dish and suture the other horizontal incision.\nSet sutures on the vertical incisions.\nDo not place sutures in the uppermost part of the keel, because the skin here will not be able to hold.\n7. Returning the Animal to the Anesthetic-free Solution\nLift the Petri dish with the animal and submerge both very gently into fresh water only 5 cm deep and let the animal slide off.",
    "NOTE: The shallow water depth ensures that the animal will not attempt to swim to the surface to breathe.\nDo not change the water during the first week.\nWhen feeding the animals, ensure that the food is placed near the animal’s head.\nNOTE: The purpose of these measures is to avoid as much movement as possible during the first week.\n8. Postoperative Ultrasound\nPrior to the termination of anesthesia, use a high frequency ultrasound system to acquire images of the injury that can be used for the construction of three-dimensional images of the SCI site.\nAttach the transducer to a micromanipulator preferably governed by a remote joystick.\nSubmerge the anesthetized animal in the prone position into a small container filled with anesthetic solution.\nNOTE: Fix the animal with miniature sandbags or other equipment to avoid movement during the scanning sequence.\nAlign the tip of the transducer with the animal’s length axis and submerge it into the benzocaine solution until it is only a few millimeters above the keel behind the hind limbs of the animal.\nIdentify the SCI site.\nNOTE: The injury site is easily recognizable due to the missing spinous processes directly above the SCI.\nOptimize the image by adjusting the ultrasound settings. Ensure that the SCI site is in the center of the image. Adjust the field of view (i.e., image depth, depth offset, and image width) to cover the SCI site and adjacent healthy tissue. Adjust the two-dimensional gain to optimize the image contrast.",
    "By sweeping the ultrasound transducer across the SCI site with an electronically operated micromanipulator, acquire B-mode images covering the SCI site at multiple sagittal cross-sectional slice locations, with consecutive slices with an interslice interval of 50 µm. Acquire cine-images containing 500 frames with a frame rate of ~50 frames/s and a transducer frequency of 40 MHz.\nNOTE: This setup requires an electronic micromanipulator governed by a remote joystick (step 8.2).\nAfter finishing the scanning sequence return to step 7.\nSubscription Required.
