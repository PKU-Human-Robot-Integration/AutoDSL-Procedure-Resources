    "All animal experimental protocols were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the Institute for Nutritional Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).\n1. DIO Mouse Model\nHFHS feeding\nFeed the eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice with an HFHS that contains 40 kcal% fat and 40 kcal% sucrose. House them in 12 h dark-light cycle conditions.\nKeep the mice in HFHS diet-feeding condition for four to sixteen weeks. Check the body weight weekly.\nBody composition analysis and pseudo-color image analysis\nSubject the mice to a body composition analyzer analysis.\n\t\t\nSecure conscious, not anesthetized mice in a plastic tube in the. Measure the body fat mass, lean mass, and fluids using an NMR system, as described previously2.\nScan the whole body of each mouse using an MRI system.\n\t\t\nAnesthetize the mice with 1% avertin via intraperitoneal injection (25 µL/g) and perform the imaging analysis in specialized glass tubes.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The process of imaging lasts for nearly 0.5 h for each mouse. When the measurement is completed, return the mice to their cage.\nScan the whole bodies of the mice in dorsal, middle, and ventral layers; scan the liver in the vertical direction. Use a 0.55 T magnet and the following instrumental parameters: K space = 192 x 256 µm, section thickness = 3 mm, TE = 14.8 ms, TR = 400 ms, FOVRead = 100 mm, FOVPhase = 100 mm, and number of scans = 8. Scan using the same magnetic condition for the all groups of mice.\nMap the grayscale image onto a pseudo-color image according to the signal intensity9.\nMouse euthanasia\nSterilize dissecting tools, such as forceps and scissors.",
    "Pour sufficient isoflurane on a paper towel and let the isoflurane volatilize in a glass jar. Ensure that the mice are euthanized by the isoflurane.\nFix the mice on an operating table. Spray each abdomen with 75% ethanol, make an incision in the dermis of the xiphoid process using scissors, and tear the dermis lengthwise through the midline with the hands to expose the peritoneum.\nClamp the xiphoid process with forceps and cut the peritoneum breadthwise through the bottom of the ribs to expose the viscera.\nCollect blood in EDTA-coated tubes by cardiac puncture.\nCut the diaphragm along the liver and carefully remove the liver from the enterocoelia using fine scissors. Cut three pieces of liver tissue for the following lipid measurements: a) 6 x 3 x 3 mm for H&E staining, b) 6 x 3 x 3 mm for Oil Red O staining, and c) 20-40 mg of liver for chloroform/methanol extraction.\nH&E staining\nFix the liver in 4% phosphate-buffered formalin acetate at 4 °C overnight and then embed it in paraffin wax.\nCut paraffin sections (5 µm) and mount them on glass slides for H&E staining, as previously described3,10.\nOil Red O staining\nRegent preparation\n\t\t\nPrepare Oil Red O working solution with 10% formalin, 60% isopropanol, Hematoxylin, and glycerol jelly. Dissolve 0.5 g of Oil Red O powder with 100 mL of isopropanol and heat it in a 60 °C bath to make a 0.5% stock solution.\nDilute with double distilled water (ddH2O) at a 3:2 ratio (3 mL of stock solution and 2 mL of ddH2O). Filter the working solution and let stand for at least 10 min at room temperature.",
    "Embed the liver in optimum cutting temperature (OCT) compound in a plastic embedding box. Freeze it at -20 °C for 30 min. Cut it into 8-µm sections in a freezing microtome, mount the tissue on a slide, and place it at room temperature for 30 min.\nPlace a paper towel in the bottom of a staining tub and pour a small amount of 10% formalin to wet the paper towel. Place the slide in the staining tub and fix the frozen sections in formaldehyde vapors for 5 min at 4 °C.\nDip the slide in 60% isopropanol in the staining tub for 3 s; repeat once.\nAdd a few drops of Oil Red O working solution to the slide to cover all tissue and incubate for 15 min. Protect the tissue from light at room temperature.\nRinse the slide in new 60% isopropanol in the staining tub for 3 s; repeat twice.\nGently rinse the slide through distilled water twice and remove the water around the tissue. Be sure not to dry the tissue.\nPlace the slide in Hematoxylin for 1 min and rinse gently with tap water for 5-10 min. Gently rinse the slide in distilled water twice and keep the it in distilled water until ready to put on the coverslip.\nHeat up the glycerol jelly in the microwave and place several drops on top of the tissue. Gently place the coverslip on top and take care not to form bubbles.\nObserve the stain under a microscope and capture characteristic pictures using 20X and 40X objectives.\nMeasurement of liver lipids\nPlace the dissected liver tissue in a new 2-mL plastic centrifuge tube. Homogenize in 1 mL of PBS with a homogenizer and transfer the lysate to a new 15-mL glass tube.",
    "Add 5 mL of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) solution, vortex the mixture vigorously for 1 min, and let stand for 2 h on ice.\nCentrifuge at 1,650 x g for 10 min at 4 °C; the mixture should separate into 3 layers: the upper methanol layer, the middle protein disc, and the bottom chloroform and lipids.\nTransfer the bottom phase into a new glass tube using a glass Pasteur pipet; there is no need to get every drop of the bottom fraction. Set the tube aside on ice.\nAdd 600 µL of 4 mM MgCl2 and 1.5 mL of chloroform to the supernatant fraction left in the previous tube and vortex vigorously. Incubate on ice for 30 min and centrifuge at 1,650 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nCombine the bottom phase with the first bottom phase tube using Pasteur pipet. Discard the upper and middle layers.\nEvaporate the chloroform under nitrogen gas in a 37 °C bath. Wash the sides of the glass tubes thoroughly with 200 µL of 1% Triton X-100/chloroform (v/v). Evaporate under nitrogen gas. Dissolve the lipid with 200 µL of ddH2O and vortex well to make the final emulsion.\nMeasure the total triglyceride (TG) and cholesterol (TC) levels by using a triglyceride or cholesterol kit according to the manufacturer's protocol3.\n\t\tNOTE: The lipid values are normalized to those of the protein concentrations in the initial homogenate, as determined by protein quantification3.\n2. Primary Mouse Hepatocyte Model\nIsolation of mouse primary hepatocytes\nAnesthetize each mouse with 6% chloral hydrate (10 µL/g intraperitoneally).\nIsolate primary hepatocytes, as previously described10. Grow cells on collagen-coated glass coverslips in a 6-well plate for Oil Red O staining. For lipid extraction, seed the cells onto a 10-cm cell culture dish10.\nCell treatment and Oil Red O staining",
    "Replace the medium with 2 mL of starvation medium and incubate at 37 °C for 24 h. Treat it with 30 mM glucose and 100 nM insulin. Incubate it in a 37 °C culture incubator for 24 h.\nAspirate the medium. Add 2 mL of PBS and swirl gently to rinse the medium; repeat once.\nFix the coverslip to the slide with a rubber band. Expose the cells adherent to the outside surface. Perform the Oil Red O staining as described above (step 1.5).\n\t\tNOTE: The basal levels of lipid accumulation are stimulated with a high glucose plus insulin treatment after serum starvation. The lipid drops are visualized by Oil Red O staining.\nMeasurement of lipids\nTreat the hepatocytes with high glucose plus insulin in the same condition (step 2.2.1). Add 1 mL of PBS to each 10-cm cell culture dish. Scrape off the cells and harvest them into new 15-mL glass tubes, from which aliquots of 100 µL are transferred to fresh 1.5-mL tubes for protein quantification.\nAdd 4 mL of Chloroform/Methanol (2:1, v/v) to the remaining 900 µL of cells. Sonicate for approximate 20 beeps and then vortex vigorously to release the lipid in the cells. Incubate the mixture on ice for 2 h. Perform the lipid extraction (step 1.6).\nSubscription Required.
