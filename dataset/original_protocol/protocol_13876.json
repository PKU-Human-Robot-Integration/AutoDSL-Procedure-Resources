    "The Dartmouth College Animal Care and Use Program is accredited by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (iAAALAC) and adheres to all UDSA and NIH (Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare) guidelines and regulations. All in vivo studies were approved by the Dartmouth College Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Euthanasia procedure adhere to the 2020 AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals.\n1. Instrumentation/design of the system\nDesign custom AMF antenna (coil) to be a closed loop, choosing shapes to create the desired magnetic field. Use inductance formulas and characteristics from power generator choice to design compatible coils to generate the desired field. Use different designs for in vitro and in vivo experiments.\nEnsure the AMF antenna inductance falls within the acceptable range of the power generator. Add or subtract capacitors to match (tune) the antenna to the power generator.\nFor in vitro experiments, design a 14-turn helical coil, inner diameter 2 cm and length 14 cm, that can contain 1.5 mL tubes, allowing for the treatment of multiple samples simultaneously. Insulate the coil with a vinyl polymer and use a polystyrene spacer to separate the coil from the tubes. Details of design specification and considerations are present in the Supplementary File 1.\nFor in vivo experiments, acquire a custom built whole-body helical coil from a manufacturer with proprietary design information. Use 8 mm square tubing (as it creates a more uniform field within the bore of the coil), and a concentrator at the targeted treatment area. Make the concentrator 5.0 cm long, with a total of 5 turns resulting in a 3.6 cm inner diameter, 5.2 cm outer diameter, and have its location at the targeted treatment area. Surround the coil with a polycarbonate shell.",
    "Use an AMF generator with adjustable power and frequency, rated at 10 kW or greater as the power source. Inductance match the power source and antennae/coils to a range of 0.62 to 1.18 µHenries (µH), allowing for frequencies ranging between 30-300 kHz. Cool the generator using recycled water through a centrifugal boost pump, pressure regulated to 50 psi.\nCool the coils with a 5.6 ton cooling capacity chiller that pumps 25% ethylene glycol-based heat transfer fluid diluted with water through the AMF antenna. Set the temperature of the chiller to such that the antenna does not heat or cool the sample.\nFor the animal containment, construct a tubular holder that can be suspended in the center of the coil with a 0.5 cm air gap between the holder and the coil surface. Connect an adjustable conditioned air pump that circulates air through the shell around the coil and set it to maintain a normal animal core temperature. Connect the anesthesia machine to the tubular animal holder near the head of the animal to ensure proper delivery of anesthesia.\nFor cell containment, create an apparatus that circulates water from a water bath through the spacer where tubes are placed. Set the temperature of this water bath such that the tubes are surrounded by water at 37 °C.\nUse fiber optic probes to monitor temperatures within the tumor, the animal’s core, and the animal environment or for in vitro studies, monitoring the temperature of the cell pellet, and the water surrounding the tubes.\nUse magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles that are 100 nm in size for all experiments.\n\tNOTE: Concentration and specific absorption rate (SAR) are two characteristics that must be considered when choosing nanoparticles, as they directly affect the possible heating and thermal dose18.\n2. Hyperthermia in vitro",
    "Culture B16F10 murine melanoma cells in RPMI media with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/strep. Plate 150, 000 cells/well in 6-well plates, with 2 mL of complete medium.\nDetermine the appropriate treatment for each well, i.e., cells without mNPs and no AMF, cells with mNPs and no AMF, cells without mNPs and AMF, cells with mNPs and AMF.\n\tNOTE: Additionally, ensure there are appropriate controls if combining hyperthermia with another therapy. AMF is performed in a standard research bench laboratory retrofitted with the needed power and cooling capabilities.\n24 h following plating, add mNPs to the appropriate wells as determined in the previous step. Add mNPs to a concentration of 3 mg iron/mL. Ensure the mNPs are distributed throughout the well, either by creating a stock media/mNP solution (removing old media, adding this solution) or by adding the mNPs directly and gently swirling plates for homogenous distribution.\nBegin the treatment, 48 h after the addition of mNPs, when wells are ~80% confluent, by removing the media and washing wells with fresh media. Remove the media.\nAdd 0.5 mL of trypsin to each well being treated, and gently swirl. Use a microscope to check that the cells are detached.\nAdd 1 mL of media to each well to collect the cells into 1.5 mL tubes. Collect all the cells from the well (~1 x 106 cells). Use a clearly labeled separate tube for each well.\nSpin tubes at 60 x g for 2-3 min to allow cells to pellet. Retain the pellet in the media.\nPlace tubes in the spacer full of water within the coil. Set the temperature of the water bath such that the media and cell pellet are maintained at 37 °C. Monitor the temperature within the tube and the water bath using separate fiber optic temperature probes.",
    "Turn on the chiller, check that the coolant is flowing through the coil. Turn on the power source and adjust the percent of maximum to field desired. Operate the 14-turn solenoid coil, powered by 10 kW generator, at 165 kHz and 23.87 kA/m (300 Oe).\nPlace a separate fiber optic temperature probe into one of the tubes. Treat the cells until the previously determined protocol thermal dose. An example is 30 min at 43 °C (CEM43 of 30).\nResuspend cells in the media that is in their tubes and re-plate into new 6 well plates. Clearly label the new plates. The goal is to re-plate all the cells collected (~1 x 106 cells).\n\tNOTE: New 6 well plates should be used to ensure the cells being cultured received treatment. If the old plates are used there could still be cells left on the plates that were not successfully trypsinized.\nIf necessary, for the next experimental procedure, lyse the cells for RNA or protein expression analysis.\n3. Hyperthermia in vivo\nCell culture and inoculation\n\t\nCulture B16F10 murine melanoma cells in RPMI media with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/strep. Use plates/dishes that will provide enough cells for inoculation of the desired number of animals. For example, 10, 100 mm dishes, plated at 100, 000 cells will be confluent with enough cells for 20 mice injections within 48 h.\nTrypsinize cells and collect using pure RPMI media (no FBS or pen/strep).\nCount cells and create a solution for the desired concentration of cells, based on the inoculation volume, and mouse numbers.",
    "Anesthetize 6-week old female C57Bl/6 mice using vaporized isoflurane and oxygen. Place animals into a plexiglass box with 5% isoflurane and 95% oxygen until induced. Once induced, remove animal and use a face cone at 2% isoflurane to complete steps 3.1.5-3.1.7 and 3.3.3-3.3.6.\n\t\tNOTE: For anesthesia during the treatment use a built-in anesthesia containment. Follow standard institutional protocols for mouse anesthesia. Prior to animal experimentation ensure appropriate IACUC approval. After anesthesia, return the animal to cage and monitor recovery to ensure no complications.\nCheck for the lack of response to the righting reflexes.\nShave the right flank using an electric shaver.\nClean the injection area with an alcohol wipe. Inject 1-2 x 106 cells, using a 100 µL glass syringe with a 28 G needle, dispersed in 50 µL of media intradermally on the shaved right flank of anesthetized.\nTumor growth/Nanoparticle injection\n\t\nMeasure tumors in 3 dimensions using calipers (length, width, and depth), and calculate volumes by (length x width x depth x π)/6.\nWhen tumor volumes reach 120 mm3 (+/- 20 mm3), place the animals on study. Design the study, ensuring there are appropriate control and treatment groups including combination therapy cohorts (i.e., control, mNPH, radiation, and the combination).\nAnesthetize mice that will be receiving mNPs as described in 3.1.4.\nClean the area with an alcohol wipe. Inject mNPs into the tumor 3 h before AMF treatment. Inject a volume such that the dose is 7.5 mg of iron/cm3 of tumor.\n\t\tNOTE: Unpublished data from the lab suggests maximal mNP uptake occurs at 3-6 h.\nAMF treatment\n\t\nAnesthetize the mouse and place on a heating pad to maintain core temperature.\nCheck for the lack of response to the righting reflexes. Remove the ear tag or any other metal objects on the mouse.",
    "Gently place a lubed fiber optic temperature probe into the rectum of the mouse.\nPlace a catheter into the tumor, removing the needle. Cut the catheter such that it does not stick out of the tumor too much.\n\t\tNOTE: The fiberoptic temperature catheters are placed and removed while the mice are under general anesthesia i.e., the catheters are only in place during the tumor heating procedure. Mice are given a single subcutaneous dose of an NSAID analgesia medication, ketoprofen (5 mg/kg), at the time of the procedure. We have not observed short or long-term discomfort or morbidity associated with the placement of the catheters.\nInsert a 3-sensor fiber optic temperature probe into the catheter. The catheter protects the fiber optic temperature probe sensors.\nTape the rectal and intratumoral probe to the tail of the animal to ensure they remain in place.\nPlace the mouse into a 50 mL tube, head to the bottom. The tube should have a hole near the head where the anesthesia will be connected and delivered.\nPlace the tube within the coil set up and reconnect the anesthesia.\nPlace a fiber optic temperature probe loosely into the tube to measure the environment temperature.\nTurn on the chiller, and ensure coolant is being circulated.\nCheck and ensure the computer software is displaying the various temperatures and begin recording to allow for a CEM43 calculation to be displayed in real time. The required CEM43 is the dose previously determined.\n\t\tNOTE: Before the magnet is turned on, ensure no metal items are attached to the animal, as these will heat rapidly. Additionally, ensure that everyone in the room does not have a pacemaker and it is safe for them to be there.\nTurn on the magnet at a low power percentage.",
    "Ensure that the fiber optic temperature probes are recording temperature changes. Temperatures will increase once the AMF is activated as the field increases. Ensure the core temperature of the animal remains at 38 °C. Regulate the core temperature using the conditioned air jacket.\nAdjust the strength of the magnetic field by changing the power on the generator, using the built-in control dial, which in turn controls the temperature level in the tumor.\nShut off the AMF once desired dose, as previously determined by the user (for example CEM43 40), is achieved within the tumor.\nOnce the AMF is shut down, remove the tube from the coil.\nRemove the mouse from the tube, extracting the various probes & catheter. If necessary, tag the animal with a new metal ear tag.\nOnce treatments are completed, shut down the chiller.\nRecover the animals from anesthesia ensuring no complications. Monitor their behavior to ensure return to normal.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
