    "All animal protocols have been approved by the University of Colorado Denver Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). All procedures described below (sections 4–7) have been optimized using both male and female C57BL/6 mice. This approach has been validated using mice ranging from 19–40 g in body weight.\n1. Creation of platform for IB administration\nBend the bookend from the original 90° angle between the basal wing and standing wing to 70° (Figure 2A).\nDrill a hole at the center-top of the standing wing of the metal bookend (Figure 2A).\nDrill a hole of identical size at the corresponding position of the plastic board. Drill two smaller holes inferiorly and laterally (Figure 2A).\nDrape a 4:0 silk suture between these small holes in the plastic board (Figure 2A).\nPlace the hook and loop tape on the edge of the plastic board (Figure 2A).\nAssemble the plastic board to the metal bookend with the screw (Figure 2B). Ensure that the screw-nut is sufficiently tight to hold the board in position while allowing for adjustment of angle, if necessary.\nEnsure that rotation of the plastic board is clockwise and counterclockwise, moving freely.\n\tNOTE: Clockwise motion is represented in this report as a (+) degree rotation, and counterclockwise is represented as a (-) degree rotation.\nUse an angle protractor to position the plastic board at +30°, +86°, -30°, and -74° and mark them on the bookend, respectively.\n2. Creation of extended catheters for IB agent administration\nMake a right angle cut with a sharp blade on the tip of an original 22 G catheter (25 mm, see Table of Materials) (Figure 3, step 1a).\nBevel (~50°–60°) the tip of the other original catheter (25 mm) with the blade, then cut off at right angle from the hub (Figure 3, step 1b).",
    "Glue the two catheters at their blunt ends with a slightly less than 180° angle (Figure 3, step 2).\nBlunt the beveled tip by melting with a low temperature cautery (see Table of Materials).\nPolish the extended catheter with “0” size sandpaper on the glued area and the beveled tip of the extended catheter (Figure 3, step 3).\nMark on the extended catheter with different colors at 25 mm, 30 mm, and 35 mm (Figure 3, step 3).\nIndicate the bevel side of the extended catheter by labeling its hub with marker.\nRinse the extended catheter with DI water, following by flushing inside of the catheter with 70% ethanol. Airdry the catheter.\nSterilize with UV light for 10 min before use.\n3. Pre-procedure preparation\nMake all administered agents in a biological safety hood under sterile technique.\nClean the workplace with 70% ethanol.\nSterilize all surgical tools with 70% ethanol.\nFix the base of the work platform to the bench immediately in front of the researcher by affixing C-clamps to the basal wing of the bookend.\nGenerate several makeshift spirometers, which are devices that will allow for detection of tidal airflow in mice. Briefly, deposit 60 µL of sterilized saline into a 1 mL syringe (plunger removed) with a gel loading tip.\n\tNOTE: The deposited drop of saline occludes the barrel and moves upwards and downwards when exposed to tidal ventilation3.\nLoosely attach the hub of a 22 G extended catheter to the makeshift spirometer.\nPlace each of the glass droppers to each side of the platform for ease of access.\nConnect the isoflurane induction chamber to the rodent anesthesia machine (see Table of Materials) in an isoflurane-compatible biological safety cabinet.\n4. Non-operative IT intubation approach",
    "Anesthetize a C57BL/6 mouse (male or female, 8–10 weeks, ~25 g) with oxygen (2 L/min) and 5% isoflurane (see Table of Materials) in an induction chamber for 4 min.\nAspirate the experimental agent to be delivered (e.g., Evans blue dye or FITC-dextran, as demonstrated in Figure 4) into two pipettes, then place them to each side of the platform during sedation.\nEnsure a respiratory rate of approximately 24–30 breaths/min before removing the mouse from the anesthesia induction chamber.\n\tNOTE: Isoflurane anesthesia typically lasts for 4 min, sufficient for all IB procedures. If the operator is not proficient with the technique, ketamine/xylazine (80 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally, see Table of Materials) may be used for more prolonged anesthesia.\nSuspend the mouse by its incisors on the draped suture line in the supine position. Secure the mouse with two to three pieces of hook and loop the tape loosely, avoiding restriction of ventilation.\nTurn on the LED fiber optic illuminator (see Table of Materials, Figure 2C).\nPosition the operator behind the platform (dorsal to the mouse).\nOrient the gooseneck of the illuminator so that it illuminates the larynx area through the skin. The distance between the mouse and light source is 2–3 cm (Figure 2C).\nConfirm the depth of anesthesia with a toe/paw pinch before performing all procedures below.\nHold the sterile forceps with the dominant hand, then draw the tongue out of the oral cavity with the forceps.\nHold the sterile depressor with the nondominant hand, then flatten the root of the tongue with the depressor to expose the oropharynx widely. The forceps can then be released, freeing the dominant hand.\nUse the dominant hand to intubate the extended catheter into the trachea via the oral cavity (Figure 2C).",
    "Confirm placement by observing if the bubble in the syringe moves up and down with each breath.\nAdditional details of IT intubation have been published previously3. Total procedure time, excluding anesthesia, lasts 10–15 s for a well-trained operator.\n5. Non-operative IB intubation and delivery approaches\nIB approach to selective lobar cannulation of the distal right lung\nAfter performing IT cannulation (step 4.11), rotate the plastic board +30° (Figure 4A).\nHold the hub of the catheter and guide it naturally in parallel to the mouse midline, extending it to weight-based depths as described in Table 1.\n\t\tNOTE: The resistance at these depths should be noted. At this point, the mouse will become slightly tachypneic, as explained in the representative results. For an experienced operator, approximately 90% of attempts will successfully cannulate the right lung (with tachypnea noted).\nDeliver 20 µL of 0.3% Evans blue dye (EBD, see Table of Materials) with a gel loading tip.\nDispense 1–2 aliquots (0.1 mL each) of air by using the glass dropper.\n\t\tNOTE: This ensures clearance of the residual EBD solution (or experimental agents) from inside of the catheter.\nWithdraw the catheter, then maintain the mouse position for 30 s.\nPlace the animal on a warming blanket until it regains consciousness. Recovery is typically complete within 2 min.\nIB approach to selective segmental cannulation of the distal left lung\nAfter performing IT cannulation (step 4.11), rotate the plastic board -74° (Figure 4B).",
    "Hold the hub of the catheter and apply gentle pressure to advance the catheter into the left mainstem bronchus, while placing modest pressure both downwards (90°) and towards the bookend. At depths noted in Table 1, the operator should note resistance as the lower segments of the left lung are engaged. If tachypnea occurs, withdraw the catheter to the 20–25 mm position, and reattempt.\nAfter cannulating the left lower lung segments, a change in position is required to allow gravitational assistance for agent administration. Rotate the plastic board -30° (Figure 4B).\nDeliver 40 µL of 0.3% EBD with a gel loading tip.\n\t\tNOTE: It is feasible to deliver a larger volume of agent because the left lung has only one lobe.\nDispense 1–2 aliquots (0.1–0.3 mL each) of air using the glass droppers.\n\t\tNOTE: This ensures clearance of any residual EBD (or experimental agents) from inside of the catheter.\nWithdraw the catheter, then maintain the mouse position for 30 s.\nPlace the animal on a warming blanket until it regains consciousness. Recovery is typically complete within 2 min.\nAdaptation of IB administration to allow delivery of agent to entirety of left or right lung \n\tNOTE: If the operator seeks to deliver agents not to a specific right lung lobe or left lung segment, but rather to the entire lung (right or left lung), the catheter should be slightly withdrawn to the respective mainstem bronchi, as follows.\n\t\nRight entire lung administration\nAfter step 4.11, rotate the plastic board +30° (Figure 5A).\nHold the hub of the catheter and guide it naturally in parallel to the mouse midline, reaching it to depths necessary for right sided distal lobar cannulation (Table 1).\nConfirm appearance of the tachypnea sign.\nRotate the mouse -74° to enable gravity assistance for agent delivery (Figure 5B).",
    "Withdraw the catheter to a position that corresponds to the takeoff of the right mainstem bronchus (Table 1). Ensure that the bevel of the catheter faces downward (Figure 5B).\nDeliver 30 µL of 0.3% EBD with a gel loading tip to the right lung.\nDispense 1–2 aliquots (0.1–0.3 mL each) of air using a glass dropper.\nWithdraw the catheter, then maintain the mouse position for 30 s. Place the animal on a warming blanket until it regains consciousness. Recovery is typically complete within 2 min.\nLeft entire lung administration\nAfter step 4.11, rotate the plastic board -74° (Figure 6A). Alternatively, rotation may occur after step 5.3.1.8 by withdrawing the catheter to the trachea, enabling bilateral IB agent administration.\nHold the hub of the catheter and apply gentle pressure to advance the catheter into the left mainstem catheter, while placing modest pressure both downwards (90°) and towards the bookend. Depth of intubation is guided by Table 1.\nConfirm the no tachypnea sign.\nRotate the mouse +86° to allow for gravity assistance with agent administration.\nWithdraw the catheter to the left mainstem bronchus (the same distances as the right lung are sufficient, Table 1) and rotate the bevel of the catheter faces downward (Figure 6B).\nDeliver 30 µL of 0.3% EBD with a gel loading tip to the left lung.\nDispense 1–2 aliquots (0.1–0.3 mL each) of air using a glass dropper.\nWithdraw the catheter, then maintain the mouse position for 30 s. Place the animal on a warming blanket until it regains consciousness. Recovery is typically complete within 2 min.\n6. Use of sequential IB cannulation approaches to deliver dose-adjusted volumes of agent to each lung\nIT administration group\nPerform IT cannulation as described in steps 4.1–4.11.",
    "Deliver 60 µL of 0.05% FITC-dextran (see Table of Materials) with a gel loading tip (Figure 1B).\nDispense 1–2 aliquots (0.1–0.3 mL each) of air using the glass droppers.\nKeep the position for 60 s and allow for mouse recovery as described above.\nSymmetric bilateral IB administration\nPerform steps 5.3.1.1–5.3.1.8 (right lung) and steps 5.3.2.1–5.3.2.8 (left lung).\nAdminister equal volumes (30 µL) of 0.05% FITC-dextran (or an experimental agent) to each side of the lung.\nDose-adjusted bilateral IB administration\nPerform step 5.3.1.1–5.3.1.8 (right lung) and steps 5.3.2.1–5.3.2.8 (left lung).\nAdminister larger volume (40 µL) of 0.05% FITC-dextran to the larger right lung, and a smaller volume (20 µL) of 0.05% FITC-dextran to the smaller left lung. In lieu of FITC-dextran, an experimental agent can be administered.\n7. Use of Dose-Adjusted IB administration to improve symmetry of single dose bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung injury\nBLM administration groups\nDose-adjusted IB-BLM (1.2 mg/kg, see Table of Materials) administration group: 60 µL (20 µL for left lung and 40 µL for right lung, respectively) of BLM solution were delivered to mice (n = 5). Controls (n = 5) received similar volumes of saline.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to steps 5.3.1 and 5.3.2.\nIT administration group: 60 µL of BLM solution were delivered to mice with IT administration techniques.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to steps 6.1.1–6.1.4.\nLung function measurement\nOn day 21 after BLM or saline, anesthetize mice with an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of ketamine (160 mg/kg) and xylazine (32 mg/kg).\nAfter confirming depth of anesthesia by paw/toe pinch, perform a tracheostomy with an 18 G cannula (see Table of Materials).\nConnect mice to the ventilator and measure respiratory mechanics as previously described4.\nLung tissue collection and processing\nFollowing measurement of pulmonary mechanics, euthanize the anesthetized mice by cardiac puncture.\nOpen the chest wall and induce bilateral pneumothoraces.",
    "Inflate lungs with 1% low melt agarose (40 °C)5 in PBS at a consistent pressure (42 cm H2O).\nCut four to five pieces of the lung along the long axis transversely, fix in 10% formalin, and embed in paraffin.\nCut 5 µm sections and stain with Masson’s trichrome to visualize collagen deposition.\n8 Post-procedural care\nAt the end of survival procedures, place the animal on a warming blanket until it regains consciousness. Recovery is typically complete within 2 min.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
