Analysis of immune cells obtained from mouse vaginal tissue by Single-cell RNA sequencing.\nSection 4. Analysis of immune cells obtained from mouse vaginal tissue by Flow cytometry.\nSection 5. In vitro expansion and flow cytometric analysis of murine γδ T cells.\nSection 1: Infection of HSV-2\nTiming: 5–7 days\nThis section describes how to induce HSV-2 infection in female mice via an intravaginal route.\nNote: During the washing and virus injection step, the sharp pipette tip can injure vaginal tissue. To avoid damage, use a round tip and insert the tip as gently as possible.\nNote: Herpes Simplex Virus 2 (HSV-2) is classified as a Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) organism. Therefore, BSL-2 facility is required to execute experiments using HSV-2 listed in this protocol.\nNote: In this section, collection of vaginal lavages or washing vaginal tissue is required. To perform this, draw up 50 μL of chilled D-PBS (without calcium and magnesium) with autoclaved 200 μL pipette tip and gently put the end of the tip in the vaginal opening. Then, push the piston of the pipette to wash the inside of the mouse vagina. The withdrawn fluid contains vaginal lavage. To wash the vagina, perform these procedures several times until the withdrawn fluid is clear.\nInject 100 μL MPA solution subcutaneously into the back of a mouse.\nFive to 7 days after MPA injection, inject HSV-2 intravaginally.",
    "Note: Monitor the estrus cycle of mice after the MPA injection. The purpose of MPA treatment is to induce a diestrus state. During the diestrus state, cornified epithelial cells are disappeared, and round immune cells appear. Then, after the diestrus state is fully induced, the number of immune cells is also decreased. Therefore, during the diestrus state, vaginal lavage contains very little number of cells. Therefore, after the MPA injection, check the vaginal lavage to determine the time point of diestrus induction and then perform further experiments.\nDilute HSV-2 stock in D-PBS (without calcium and magnesium) to obtain a final concentration of 106 pfu/mL.\nWash the vaginal tract of mice with chilled D-PBS.\nInject 10 μL diluted virus into the vagina using a micropipette tip.\nMonitor body weight and score infection severity as follows: 0, no sign; 1, slight genital erythema and edema; 2, moderate genital inflammation; 3, purulent genital lesions; 4, hindlimb paralysis; and 5, moribund.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] For humane treatment, euthanize mice before reaching a moribund state.\nSection 2: Isolation of cells from mouse vaginal tissue\nTiming: ∼2 h\nThis section describes how to harvest mouse vaginal tissue and isolate single cells.\nNote: This vaginal tissue single-cell dissociation protocol is used from a previous paper6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] with optimization. The enzyme concentration and treatment duration can vary according to the researcher’s preference and may require further optimization.\nNote: Vaginal tissue is located close to the bladder and urinary tract. To avoid contamination, carefully remove the urethra without rupturing the bladder.\nDissociate the mouse vagina.\nEuthanize the mouse by CO2 inhalation and sanitize with 70% ethanol.\nRemove the abdominal skin and expose the abdominal muscle.\nRemove the fat tissue under the pelvis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, Green rectangle).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2734-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Mouse vaginal tissue harvesting",
    "(A–F) Surgical procedures to harvest vaginal tissue of mice. Cut the abdominal skin of the mouse and expose the peritoneal muscle. Pull the skin to the tail to expose the pelvis and remove fat tissue (A). Cut the abdominal side of the pelvis with scissors to make an incision (B). Open the incision to expose the vaginal tissue (C). When the vaginal tissue is exposed, Urethra is located on the vagina (D). Carefully remove the urethra from the vaginal tissue without rupturing the bladder (E). After removal of the urethra, cut out the vulva from the perineum (F). Pull the vagina and vulva orthogonal to the rectum to separate the vagina from the rectum (G). Fully separate the vagina from the rectum until the cervix is visible (H). Excise vaginal tissue from the cervix and excise the vulva (I).\nMake an incision in the pelvis with scissors (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: Single incision at the center of the abdominal side of the pelvis is enough to open the pelvis. The incision site is marked by the green dotted line.\nOpen the pelvis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C) and expose the vagina (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: When opening the pelvis, pull each side (left and right) of the pelvis with forceps.\nNote: When the vagina is exposed, you can see a thin slightly white line located on the vaginal tissue. The line is the urethra.\nCarefully remove the urethra from the vaginal tissue without rupturing the bladder (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nCarefully cut out the vulva from the perineum (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nNote: Anus is closely located from the vagina, and be careful not to cut the anus. Even though mice are sanitized with 70% ethanol, inside of the anus is not fully disinfected. For the sterility of the experiment, make incisions as close as possible to the vulva.",
    "Pull the vagina orthogonal to the rectum to dissociate the vagina from the rectal tissue (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]G).\nFully dissociate the vaginal tissue from the rectum (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]H).\nRemove the vulva and cut the vagina off from the cervix (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]I).\nNote: The cell population can vary if the cervix is included in the vaginal sample.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] Therefore, carefully remove the cervix so as not to include cervix-infiltrating cells.\nIncubate the vaginal tissue in 5 mL Dispase II mixture for 30 min at 37°C.\nNote: Dispase II digests fibronectin and collagen, thereby softening the connection between cells consisting vaginal tissue and making tissue-infiltrated immune cells easier to be extracted. Without Dispase II treatment, immune cell yield at the end of the experiment will be decreased.\nNote: After Dispase II treatment, vaginal tissue will become softer.\nWash the vaginal tissue with tissue isolation media.\nCut the vaginal tissue into small pieces.\nUse sterile razor blades or scissors to cut the vaginal tissue.\nPlace the pieces into a 15-mL conical tube and fill the tube with tissue isolation media.\nTo collect the tissues, centrifuge the 15-mL conical tube for 5 min at 400 × g and discard the supernatant.\nNote: Keep the centrifuge temperature at 4°C.\nIncubate collected tissue pieces with the tissue digestion mixture.\nAdd 5 mL tissue digestion mixture to the tissue pieces.\nIncubate the tissue pieces at 37°C for 30 min with 100 rotations per minute (rpm) shaking.\nNeutralize the enzyme-treated tissue.\nAdd 5 mL enzyme neutralization media to the tube containing the vaginal tissue pieces and tissue digestion mixture.\nCentrifuge the 15 mL conical tube for 5 min at 400 × g and discard the supernatant.\nNote: Keep the centrifuge temperature at 4°C.\nAdd 5 mL tissue isolation media.\nCollect vaginal tissue cells containing vagina-infiltrated immune cells.",
    "Place the 70-μm cell strainer on the 100 mm × 15 mm petri dish.\nPut 5 mL tissue isolation media into the 70-μm cell strainer to soak the strainer before use.\nVortex the 15 mL conical tube and pour the tissue with tissue isolation media into the cell strainer.\nThoroughly grind the tissue pieces using the cell strainer and a plunger.\nNote: Single cell suspension will be collected outside of the cell strainer.\nNote: Do not grind too strongly to avoid making the rupture in the cell strainer.\nAttach the strainer on 50 mL conical tube and pour the cell suspension collected in the petri dish into the strainer.\nWash the strainer with 5 mL tissue isolation media to collect residual cells remaining on the cell strainer.\nCentrifuge the conical tube for 5 min at 400 × g and discard the supernatant.\nNote: Keep the centrifuge temperature at 4°C.\nTreat the harvested cells with Red blood cell lysis buffer.\nResuspend the cell pellet with 1 mL Red blood cell lysis buffer and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.\nAdd 10 mL flow cytometry media and centrifuge the conical tube for 5 min at 400 × g and discard the supernatant.\nNote: Keep the centrifuge temperature at 4°C.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL T cell culture media.\nPass the resuspended cells through a sterilized 70-μm mesh to remove dead cell clumps. Count cell numbers and store the cells on the wet ice until further use.\nNote: In non-infected mouse vaginal tissue, after fully diestrus induction with MPA injection, obtained cell number would be about 1 × 105 per mouse.\nSection 3: Analysis of immune cells obtained from mouse vaginal tissue by single-cell RNA sequencing\nTiming: ∼72 h",
    "This section describes how to analyze the transcriptome of immune cells obtained from the harvested vaginal tissue via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq).\nNote: The scRNAseq analysis platform and analytical parameters can vary depending on the researcher’s preference. This protocol follows the manufacturer’s user guide, which contains additional procedural details (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/library-prep/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v3-chemistry[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/library-prep/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v3-chemistry]).\nPerform immune cell sorting from the cell suspension obtained from the mouse vagina (obtained from Section 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nTransfer cell suspension into a FACS tube.\nTo wash out the T cell culture media, add 2 mL flow cytometry media to the sample and centrifuge the FACS tube for 5 min at 400 × g and discard the supernatant.\nNote: Keep the centrifuge temperature at 4°C.\nRepeat step 13-b to fully wash out the residual T cell culture media.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1–2 mL flow cytometry media to reach a final concentration of 1×106 cells/mL.\nAdd 5 μL (equal to 0.25 μg of chemical mass) 7-Amino-Actinomycin D per 1×106 cells and incubate for 5–10 min in the dark to stain the dead cell population.\nSort 7-Amino-Actinomycin D – negative immune cells using a FACSAria Fusion until obtaining 1–2 × 105 total cells. Collect sorted cells with a new 15-mL conical tube containing 5 mL T cell culture media.\nNote: Using D-PBS or flow cytometry media rather than T cell culture media reduces cell viability after sorting.\nFill the tube containing sorted cells with cold D-PBS up to 15 mL and centrifuge the FACS tube for 5 min at 400 × g.\nNote: Keep the centrifuge temperature at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant without disrupting the cell pellet. Repeat step 15 to fully wash out residual T cell culture media.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells with cold D-PBS to reach the final concentration of ∼1000 cells/μL.",
    "Note: This range of cell concentration is optimal, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.\nProceed with cell barcoding, reverse transcription, fragmentation, end repair, A-tailing, adaptor ligation, library construction, and sequencing strictly following the 10× Genomics manufacturer’s user guide. The targeted sequencing number is 10000.\nRun 10× Chromium Cell Ranger according to the manufacturer’s protocol and generate barcodes (bacordes.tsv), features (features.tsv), and feature-barcode matrix (matrix.mtx).\nCreate Seurat objects and perform quality control.\nNote: This step follows the Seurat Vignettes described online. (https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html[href=https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html]).\nNote: For quality control, exclude cells with unique features of RNA (nFeature_RNA<200 and >6,000) and with more than 5% of reads aligning with mitochondrial genes.\nNormalize the Seurat object and find variable features.\nCombine objects by finding and combining the anchorsets by using FindIntegrationAnchors and IntegrateData functions, respectively.\nNote: This step follows the Seurat Vignettes described online (https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_introduction.html[href=https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/integration_introduction.html])\nPerform scaling, linear data dimensional reduction, and non-linear dimensional reduction by ScaleData, RunPCA, and runUMAP function.\nCluster the cells by FindNeighbors and FindClusters functions.\nNote: For FindNeighbors function, we set dims = 1:30. For FindClusters function, we set resolution = 0.5 for the analysis.\nPlot the clustered cells using the DimPlot function (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2734-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. scRNAseq analysis of immune cells infiltrated into HSV-2-infected vaginal tissue",
    "(A–H) Five-week-old specific pathogen-free female C57BL/6J mice were fed a 60% Kcal HFD or a SCD for 10 weeks ad libitum. Each mouse was infected with 104 pfu/mouse HSV-2, and vaginal tissue was harvested 3 days after infection. Immune cells from vaginal tissue were sorted, and scRNAseq was performed.

The gating strategy and example analysis data are shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2734-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Gating strategy to identify and analyze γδ T cells from vaginal tissue using flow cytometry\nRepresentative plot showing flow cytometric analysis. Live cells are gated using propidium-iodide staining. Singlet cells are then gated by FSC-A and FSC-H gating. Leukocytes are gated by CD45.2 expression, and cells without CD11b expression were gated. Among CD11b- cells, those cells expressing CD3ε and not expressing NK1.1 were gated as a T cell population. Among T cells, γδ T cells are gated by γδTCR expression. CD3ε+γδTCR- cells are further gated by CD4 and CD8 expression to discriminate between CD4 (CD3ε+γδTCR-CD4+) and CD8 (CD3ε+γδTCR-CD8+) T cells.\nNote: For multi-color flow cytometry, fluorescence compensation is required.\nNote: Vaginal tissue sample includes various debris and dead cell population. Therefore, discriminating dead cells against the live cell population is strictly required. For live cell discrimination, propidium iodide solution was used in the current protocol. Alternative methods, such as 7-Amino-Actinomycin D (7-AAD) or fixable-viability dyes can be used to select live cells.\nSection 5: In vitro expansion and flow cytometric analysis of murine γδ T cells\nTiming: 96 h\nThis section describes how to expand murine γδ T cells from the spleen and analyze the expanded γδ T cells using flow cytometry.\nNote: In this protocol, BD LSRFortessa X-20 is used to acquire raw data, and FlowJo software is used for analysis. The flow cytometers and software used for this analysis can vary depending on the researcher’s preferences.\nNote: Murine γδ T cells are obtained from the spleen of C57BL/6J mice. Other lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes or the thymus, can be used depending on the researcher’s preferences.",
    "Note: The percentage of γδ T cells in the spleen is very small (∼2% of total CD3ε+ cells). In this protocol, the enrichment method is used to obtain a sufficient number of γδ T cells. Alternatively, mouse lines lacking conventional T cells (e.g., TCRb knock-out mice, Jax stock number: 002118; TCRa knock-out mice; Jax stock number: 002116) can be used to obtain more γδ T cells without enrichment.\nPrepare an anti-γδTCR antibody-coated 24-well plate.\nPlace 500 μL anti-γδTCR antibody coating solution into a non-tissue culture-treated 24-well plate to coat 2.5 μg anti-γδTCR antibody in each well.\nNote: Antibody concentrations can be changed with further optimization depending on the researcher’s preferences.\nIncubate the plate at 4°C for 18–24 h to coat the plate. Before cell stimulation, aspirate the anti-γδTCR antibody coating solution.\nHarvest the spleen.\nHarvest splenocytes.\nPlace the 70 μm cell strainer on the 100 mm × 15 mm petri dish.\nPut 10 mL tissue isolation media into the cell strainer to soak the strainer before use.\nPut the spleen on the cell strainer and thoroughly grind the spleen.\nNote: Single cell suspension will be collected outside of the cell strainer.\nNote: Do not grind too strongly to avoid making the rupture in the cell strainer.\nPut the strainer in 50 mL conical tube and pour the cell suspension collected in the petri dish into the strainer.\nWash the strainer with 5 mL tissue isolation media to collect residual cells remaining on the cell strainer.\nCentrifuge the conical tube for 5 min at 400 × g and discard the supernatant.\nNote: keep the centrifuge temperature at 4°C.\nTreat the harvested cells with Red blood cell lysis buffer.\nResuspend the cell pellet with 5 mL Red blood cell lysis buffer and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.",

Count cell numbers.\nTransfer the cell suspension to 15 mL conical tube\nCentrifuge the conical tube for 5 min at 400 × g and discard the supernatant.\nNote: keep the centrifuge temperature at 4°C.\nResuspend 1 × 107 cells in 0.1 mL magnetic sorting media. Place the cells in a 5-mL polystyrene tube.\nNote: Scale up or down depending on the cell number sustaining the concentration.\nEnrich γδ T cells.\nNote: In this protocol, sequential three-step depletion of B cells, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells is performed. As a result, splenocytes containing γδ T cells, NK cells, and myeloid cells are enriched. As commercial γδ T cell sorting kits use positive selection against γδTCR, the beads may block the activation of γδ T cells when the anti-γδTCR antibody is used to stimulate γδ T cells. Therefore, depletion of B cells and conventional T cells is used here.\nNote: Additional depletion steps can be added to enrich γδ T cells with higher purity. However, as the number of steps increases, the loss of γδ T cells increases, and a larger number of unsorted splenocytes is required.\nNote: To reduce reagent usage and for robust sorting efficiency control, sequential depletion is used in this protocol.\nPerform CD19+ cell depletion using a CD19-Positive Selection Kit and collect unbound cells.\nTreat each 0.1 mL of cells (1 × 107 cells) with 20 μL MagniSort® Anti-Mouse CD19 Biotin and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.",

Enrichment and in vitro expansion of mouse γδ T cells from splenocytes\n(A-C) Splenocytes from C57BL/6J mice are harvested, and red blood cells are lysed. Among the splenocyte population, B cells, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells are excluded by magnetic sorting. Residual splenocytes enriched with γδ T cells are stimulated by plate-coated anti-γδTCR antibody, soluble anti-CD28 antibody, and recombinant human IL-2. After CD19+ cell depletion, splenocytes are analyzed by flow cytometry. In the CD3ε-CD19 gating panel, the absence of CD19+ cells is confirmed (A). After CD19, CD4, and CD8+ cell depletion, γδ T cell-enriched splenocytes are analyzed by flow cytometry, and enrichment of γδ T cells is confirmed (B). After in vitro expansion, CD3ε+ cells comprise >90% of the total cell population, and γδ T cells comprise >90% of the expanded T cell population (C).\nPerform CD4+ cell depletion using a CD4-Positive Selection Kit and collect unbound cells following the procedure described in step 53a.",
