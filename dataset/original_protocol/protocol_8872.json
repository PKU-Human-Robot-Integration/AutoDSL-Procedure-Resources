    "1. Design Intent\nIdentify the brain region of choice (lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN, visual thalamus)) by scrolling through the sagittal sections of the electronic mouse brain atlas.\nAt A/P coordinates (-2.3 – -2.7 mm), the LGN is widest. Use this region to design the drive bottom (bottom pieces).\n\tNOTE: A total of 8 independently movable electrodes can be used to target LGN (4-6 electrodes will make it to the LGN, 2-4 electrodes are added to offset implantation errors, Figure 1A).\nIn Solidworks, draw a sketch of the design body (Figure 1B) in the front plane. Click sketch, and then use combination of lines and curves to draw a sketch which will include the contours for the drive base, handles and polyamide half slots, as shown. Ensure that the contour does not contain any open gaps. Then click Exit Sketch.\nNext, select both the front and right planes, and click “Create Axis”. Then, create the 3D design body model by rotating the highlighted blue sketch contour (Figure 1B) 360°. In the features menu, click “Revolved Boss/Base”. Choose the midline as the Axis of revolution. In the parameters section, under direction 1 click Blind, and under angle select 360.00 deg. In the selected contours section, ensure that the blue highlighted contour is the one selected.\nCreate one polyimide half-slot by revolving the red highlighted contours 13° (Figure 1C, top left). Steps are identical to 1.4 above except for the angle specification\nCreate one drive handles by revolving the green contour 15° (Figure 1C, top right).",
    "Create the second drive handle using the circular pattern function (Figure 1C, bottom left). In the features menu, click “Circular Pattern”. In parameters, choose the midline as axis of revolution. Select 180.00 deg as the angle, and 2 as the number of instances. Ensure that the first handle is selected under “Features to Pattern”.\nCreate sixteen polyimide half-slots using the circular pattern function (Figure 1C, bottom left). Perform similar motions to 1.7, but select the first polyimide half-slot as the “Features to Pattern”. The angle is 22.5° and the number of instances are 16 (Note: this is just 360° divided by the number of times you want to pattern the feature)\nCreate a new plane on which to draw the polyimide receptacle. Achieve this by clicking “insert” on the main menu. Click “Reference Geometry”, Select the two sides of polyimide half slots, and then click “Create New Plane”; (Figure 1D, top)\nCreate the microdrive receptacle (the screw hole, polyimides hole and anti-torque rail (Figure 1D, bottom). Achieve this by creating a sketch that encompasses all these features on the new plane created in 1.9. Note that for the anti-torque rails, define a centerline in between the two sides of the polyamide top slots. Then, draw the anti-torque rails by creating two circles perpendicular to the centerline, whose centers are 1 radius apart, and then trimming the middle contour.\nIn the Features menu, click on “Extrude Boss/Base” to create the antitorque rail and choose a blind extrude of 10 mm going upwards and 2 mm going downwards. For the screw hole and polyimide hole, click on “Extrude cut”, and choose blind 6mm , and a few mms going upwards for both (Figure 1E, left).",
    "Pattern the micro-drive receptacle 16x, using the center as the axis of revolution (22.5°, 16 instances, equal spacing), (Figure 1E, right)\nOn the top of the handle, draw a 3 mm x 3 mm box starting at the center tip of the drive handle, facing the central axis. Extrude this 2 mm upwards using the “Extrude Boss” function. Draw circles of 1mm diameter at the locations in which the EIB screws will go on. Afterward, make 1.5 mm “Extrude Cut” to make a hole. Then, pattern the box and hole twice using the Circular Pattern function (Text overlay: 180°, 2 instances, equal spacing, about central axis).\nUse the dimensions (in millimeters) in Figure 1F to draw a top piece sketch. Use the “Extrude Boss/Base” to make a 3D model of it.\n\tNOTE: After these steps the drive design is complete. The physical drive body is created through the process of stereolithography. There are a number of companies that offer stereolithography printing based on STL files. We recommend services that can print in hard plastic (such as Accura® 55), with a minimum resolution of at least 0.1 mm.\n2. Preparation of Hyperdrive Components\nLay out a small piece of double-sided tape on a flat surface and cut the necessary number of 31 G polyimide tubes to approximately 8 centimeters (ID/OD:.0071''/.0116''; Wall: .00225) (Figures 2A - 2B).\nLay out the first layer of guide tubes on the double-sided tape, taking care to place guide tubes as close as possible to one another on the tape. Dab a small amount of thin, cyanoacrylate glue over the layer of polyimides. (Figure 2C)\nQuickly lay out a second layer of polyimides (Figure 2D).",
    "Create a fiber optic placeholder using a 26 G cannula. Ensure that this is lubricated using a Teflon based lubricant prior to being incorporated in the assembly (Figure 2E).\nApply a line of epoxy 4-5 mm in length perpendicular to the polyimide bundle (Figure 2F). Once the epoxy has hardened (2-3 hr), remove the tape from the bottom layer and reepoxy the other side. After the epoxy has hardened again, the 26 G cannula can be removed and the construct cut in the middle using a razor blade (Figure 2G), resulting in two polyimide matrices, each of which can be used for one hyperdrive (Figure 2H).\nPrint out the cone template on a sheet of transparency paper and cut a corresponding sheet of heavy duty aluminum foil (Figures 3A - 3C).\nApply a layer of epoxy to the aluminum foil and quickly apply the transparency paper. Using a heavy object or a wooden dowel, smooth out the epoxy so that it is evenly distributed (Figure 3D).\nCut out the cone template and clamp together using an alligator clip. Finally, use another dab of epoxy to permanently affix the pieces (Figure 3E).\n3. Final Assembly of the Microdrive\nAttach the EIB to the drive body, and reinsert the 26 G cannula through the polyimide guide tube matrix. Align the polyimide matrix with the drive body using the fiber optic hole in the EIB to ensure that the guide tubes are perpendicular to the EIB and epoxy the matrix to the drive body taking care to ensure that no epoxy flows into the guide tubes or into the drive body (Figures 4A - 4C).",
    "Map each guide tube in the polyimide matrix to a corresponding bracket on the inner wall of the drive body. Slide a small ring of 33 G polyimide over each guide tube and into the bracket and apply a small amount of cyanoacrylate glue to affix each guide tube. (Figures 4D - 4E) Finally, epoxy the whole apparatus to the inner wall of the drive body and cut the polyimides so that they protrude just above the inner lip (Figures 4F - 4G).\nBuild a microdrive assembly by putting one of the custom-built screws through the center hole of a top piece followed by one of the 5 mm springs. Slide the outer hole of the top piece over one of the rails, and gently drive the screw. Drive the screw until the spring reaches it's minimum compressed length. (Figures 4H - 4I) Repeat this process for each rail/microdrive (Figure 4J).\nTurn the drive array upside down and take a picture of the guide tube matrix. This picture will be used to map the location of the guide tube corresponding to each microdrive (Figure 4K).\nInsert a polyimide tube (0.005') into each guide tube from the bottom of the drive base. Let the carrier tube extend 1-2 mm from the top of the fully lowered microdrive and record on the photograph the identity of the corresponding micro-drive. (Figures 4L - 4M)\nEpoxy the polyimide tube to the microdrive support, taking care not to let epoxy run through the microdrive onto the spring or screw (Figures 4N, 4P - 4Q).\nFully lower all the microdrives. Cut all the polyimide tubes off flush at the bottom of the polyimide matrix (Figure 4O).\nMount the electrode interface board to the drive base using two #00-90 x 3/16’’ screws (Figure 4R).",
    "NOTE: At this point the drive array is ready to be loaded with stereotrodes or tetrodes. For details on tetrode construction and loading, please see 10. The printed drive base and the microdrives have been designed in SolidWorks 2011 3D CAD software: please click here[href=https://www.jove.com//cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51675/MouseDriveDoublePost.STL] to download the SolidWorks file.\nAfter loading, invert the drive and carefully lower the shielding cone over the drive so that only the bottom piece protrudes. Affix the shielding cone by epoxying the cone to the drive body.\nAfter the cone is attached, strip a small length of stainless steel wire (.008'' Bare, .011'' Coated) and pin to the EIB. Scratch the inner, aluminum part of the cone with a needle and ground the steel wire to the cone using silver paint. Once the silver paint has dried, reinforce with a dab of epoxy. Alternatively, the steel wire can directly be attached to the cone with a dab of conductive epoxy (MG Chemicals, Surrey, Canada)."
