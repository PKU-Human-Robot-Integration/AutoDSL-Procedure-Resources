    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nBlood collection and platelet isolation\nTiming: 60–90 min\nNote: This protocol is an optimization of a previous protocol1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] adapted to be used for clinical samples from COVID-19 patients. Several steps needed to be amended to emergency conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic as routine research laboratory access was suspended due to a national lockdown. Amendments are highlighted in the notes sections of the respective steps below.\nNote: In this step it is critical to handle the blood as carefully as possible so that the platelets remain quiescent in solution. Mishandling can easily cause platelet activation so that the procedure needs to be aborted and another blood donor/patient identified. The main aim is to generate a suspension of quiescent platelet for follow-up PR isolation.\nCollect 30–40 mL blood per donor/patient via venepuncture with a 21-gauge needle into individual 10 mL acid citrate dextrose-a (ACD-A) vacutainer tubes.\nDiscard the first 5 mL of blood as platelets will be activated through shear stress.\nGently invert the blood collection tubes to ensure even distribution of the anticoagulant.\nCritical: Unless the effect of anti-platelet agents is being assessed, donors/patient should not have taken any medication that inhibit platelet function (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen, anti-histamines) or anticoagulants in the previous 10 days (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section). These will directly affect the platelet response during the aggregation process.\nCentrifuge blood samples at 200 × g at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 15 min with no brake to generate platelet rich plasma (PRP).\nCritical: It is essential to disable the brake function of the centrifuge. Braking on the centrifuge in this step may induce premature platelet activation.\nNote: We used an Eppendorf 5804 centrifuge. (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) However, any low-speed centrifuge that allows regulation of acceleration and deceleration can be used.",
    "The blood will separate into three layers. The upper layer contains the PRP. Carefully transfer the PRP into a conical 50 mL falcon tube, add 1 μM PGE1 (1 μL of a 10 mM stock per 10 mL of PRP), and gently invert the tube once.\nLeave behind 5 mm PRP above the buffy coat (intermediate layer) to prevent white and red blood cell contamination.\nPGE1 assures platelet quiescence (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section), however, it will only be effective for 20–30 min.\nAdjust the pH of the PRP to 6.5 with ACD-A.\nAdd ACD-A dropwise to the PRP and carefully invert platelets once.\nThe pH can change very quickly, be careful not to over-titrate.\nCentrifuge blood samples at 150 × g at room temperature (20°C–25°C) for 7 min with brake set to 4 to pellet remaining contaminating red blood cells.\nNote: Any remaining red or white blood cells will form a ring at the bottom of the tube. It is important to ensure contamination levels are below threshold as detected by conventional Sysmex analyses. Stop removal of the supernatant if red and white blood cell ring is dislodged.\nTransfer the supernatant into a fresh 50 mL falcon tube, again add 1 μM PGE1, and gently invert tube, carefully leaving about 5 mm of PRP above the contaminating pelleted cells.\nNote: Do not disturb the contaminating cell layer on the bottom of the tube when transferring the supernatant.\nCentrifuge PRP at 600 × g at room temperature (20°C–25°C) with brake set to 4 for 10 min to pellet platelets.\nRemove supernatant (platelet poor plasma (PPP)).\nQuiescent platelets pellet in a ring on the bottom of the tube.\nOptional: PPP can be stored at −80°C for subsequent analyses or discarded. If discarded, ensure disposal of PPP in appropriate waste containers for blood products.",
    "Wash the platelet pellet by carefully resuspending them in 10 mL Modified Tyrode’s buffer.\nNote: It is best to use a disposable transfer pipette as they have a wider opening that reduces shear stress to the platelets during resuspension and ensures platelets remain quiescent. Additionally, the pipette should not be in direct contact with the pellet to avoid platelet activation.\nRe-centrifuge platelets as in step 7.\nRemove and discard supernatant.\nDetermine platelet concentration using an automated cell counter.\nNote: All automated cell counters detecting a cell size range of 2.5–5 μm can be used. Platelet suspensions should be diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions[href=https://www.beckman.com/techdocs/9914591DB/wsr-116682].\nResuspend platelets to a final concentration of 1 × 109 platelets/mL in Modified Tyrode’s buffer and rest platelets for 15 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nThe platelets can now be used for follow-up experiments such as the ADP release assay described in Comer et al.2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] or the generation of PR described below.\nOptional: In case of low platelet counts, platelets can also be resuspended to a final concentration of 2 × 108 platelets/mL (see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section), however, this will result in lower protein concentration in the PR that might not suffice for follow-up analyses (e.g., proteomics).\nCritical: PR needs to be prepared immediately following platelet isolation and resting at RT. Platelets cannot be cooled below RT or indeed ever frozen as cold storage of platelets induces artificial platelet activation!3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4],5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nPlatelet releasate (PR) preparation\nTiming: 30–60 min",
    "Note: This step generates PR. The specific choice of agonist and respective concentration to be used is dependent on the researcher. We have optimized this protocol to generate PR from clinical samples with bovine thrombin at final concentrations of 0.5 U/mL, and 0.1 U/mL as well as with the synthetic thromboxane agonist U46619 at concentrations of 6.6 μM and 1 μM.\nAdd 1.8 mM CaCl2 (final concentration) to the platelet suspension.\nVolume of CaCl2 (1 M stock) calculates as follows:\n1.8\nm\nM\nC\na\nC\nl\n2\n1000\nm\nM\nC\na\nC\nl\n2\n×\nV\no\nl\nu\nm\ne\no\nf\np\nl\na\nt\ne\nl\ne\nt\ns\n(\nm\nL\n)\n×\n1\n0\n3\n(\nμ\nL\nm\nL\n)\n=\nμ\nL\no\nf\nC\na\nC\nl\n2\nCritical: Recalcification of the platelets with CaCl2 is essential for an aggregation response.\nLeave platelets to re-calcify for 10 min at room temperature (20°C–25°C).\nAliquot 450 μL platelets into aggregation tubes.\nNote: The protocol can also be executed on aggregometers with a minimal volume of 250 μL. In this case, aliquot 225 μL platelets per aggregation reaction.\nAdd a stir bar to each tube.\nPrewarm platelets to 37°C for at least 5 min.\nNote: Most aggregometers have special inbuild slots to incubate aggregation tubes at constant 37°C without stirring.\nPlace aggregation tube into the aggregometer.\nEstablish a baseline for 10 s.\nAdd 50 μL agonist at the desired concentration (or Modified Tyrode’s buffer as unaggregated control) directly into the aggregation tube.",
    "Note: It is best to use gel-loading tips or similar to get to the bottom of the aggregation tube as they are very narrow. The selection of agonist and its concentration is dependent on the desired experiment. While thrombin will activate PAR receptors on platelets, U46619 activates platelets via the thromboxane receptor.\nNote: It is important to keep in mind that the agonist concentration is diluted 10-fold when added to the platelet suspension. When using an aggregometer with a reaction volume of 250 μL, add 25 μL agonist to 225 μL of platelet suspension to a desired final concentration.\nLet reaction run for 5 min.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2592-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representation of platelet clots following agonist stimulation\n(A) Full platelet activation (>80%) results in the formation of a tight clot around the stir bar (black) at the bottom of the aggregation tube.\n(B) Partial platelet aggregation (approximately 30%–60%) results in the formation of a smaller clot with residual platelets remaining in suspension (slightly cloudy supernatant).\n(C) Control samples (Modified Tyrode’s buffer added instead of agonist) results in no platelet aggregation and all platelets remaining in suspension.\nNote: It is important to note the percentage of maximum aggregation. The higher the aggregation response, the less platelets remain in the suspension. We defined an aggregation response of >80% as full aggregation. The platelets will form a tight clot around the stir bar (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Partial platelet aggregation (approximately 30%–60%) results in a proportion of platelets to remain in suspension (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) while all platelets remain in suspension in the not aggregated control (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nAfter 5 min of aggregation, place aggregation tubes immediately on ice to cool the platelets and suspend further activation.\nTransfer the contents of the aggregation tube into a precooled microcentrifuge tube using a micropipette.",
    "Immediately add 10 μL of both protease and phosphatase inhibitors (as prepared above) and 1 μL PGE1 (10 mM stock).\nLeave microcentrifuge tubes on ice until all samples have been processed to prevent protein degradation.\nTransfer microcentrifuge tubes into pre-cooled benchtop centrifuge.\nCentrifuge samples at 1,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min.\nCarefully remove supernatant and transfer into a fresh pre-cooled microcentrifuge tube making sure not to disturb the platelet clot. It is important to leave about 20 μL above the clot to prevent platelet contamination of the PR.\nOptional: The platelet pellet that remains in the microcentrifuge tube can either be discarded or washed and lysed on ice for 60 min using any suitable precooled lysis buffer and stored at −80°C for further desired analysis.\nRepeat steps 29 and 30 for a total of 3 centrifugations.\nAfter the final spin, add 10 μL protease and phosphatase inhibitors each and 1 μL PGE1 (10 mM stock) to the PR.\nEnriched PR can be stored at −80°C until further use."
