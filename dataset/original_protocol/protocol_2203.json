A cold buffer and sample can cause condensation and a slow flow rate. It is also necessary to avoid over-equilibration time to maintain the cell's viability.\nMeasure cell density and survival rate with a cell counter.\nDilute both cell cultures to approximately 1 × 106 cells/mL with sample media.\nMix live and dead cell cultures at approximately 50:50 to prepare 50% viability at 1 × 106 cells/mL (total of alive and dead cells).\nNote: The upper limit of cell concentration is recommended at 1 × 106 cells/mL. The cell concentration above the limit can cause inaccuracy in cell counting with the video analysis. Conversely, there is no lower cell concentration limit.\nChip decompression\nTiming: 5 min\nIn this section, a chip is decompressed immediately before use so that the microchannel of the chip can be adequately filled with fluid.\nRemove aluminum bad and take out sterile pouch containing a chip.\nNote: The chip is double wrapped, inner with a sterile pouch and outer with an aluminum cover. Remove and discard only the aluminum cover.\nPlace the chip covered with the sterile pouch into a vacuum desiccator.\nClose the vacuum desiccator lid.",
    "Start the vacuum and slowly degas using an arbitrary generator, and leave it for exactly 5 min.\nCritical: Over-decompression or insufficient decompression will cause inadequate cell sorting.\nTurn off the vacuum and slowly release the vacuum state. Wait until the vacuum gauge reaches 0 MPa.\nOpen the vacuum desiccator, and remove the chip covered with sterile pouch.\nCritical: After removing the chip from vacuum desiccator, immediately proceed to the next step to set the chip in the cell-sorting device.\nChip installation\nTiming: 2 min\nThis section introduces chip installation to the cell-sorting device (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1811-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic design of the microfluidic dielectrophoresis chip\nThe figure is from Oshiro et al. (2022)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nOpen the sterile pouch and take out the decompressed chip.\nCritical: After removing chip from sterile pouch, do not touch the inlet and outlet ports of the chip to avoid contamination.\nPlace the chip on the glass stage of cell-sorting device while holding Chip Lock Lever by hand (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Ensure that the Inlet 1 and Inlet 2 of the chip are on the left corner.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1811-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Chip on the glass stage of the cell-sorting device\nPush the chip to back unit it latches.\nNote: Ensure that Chip Device Lever is up before pushing the chip to back, or the probe unit may be damaged.\nLock Chip Device Lever to set the chip position.\nBuffer filling\nTiming: 5 min\nThis section introduces buffer filling in the cell-sorting device and chip.\nNote: Buffer must be equilibrated at room temperature before use to avoid condensation.\nTake out the longer tube (buffer tube) from a tube set and connect it to a syringe.",
    "Note: There are two tubes in the kit, one for buffer and the other for sample. Be sure to use the longer one for buffer solution.\nManually draw buffer until it reaches 1/3 to 1/2 of the syringe volume.\nTurn the syringe tip upward and tap the syringe to move air from the tube. Push the piston of the syringe to let all air out.\nCritical: If air bubbles remain in the system, it will affect the constant flow rate.\nDraw up the buffer to fill the syringe.\nInstall the syringe to Syringe Pump 1 of the cell-sorting device (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1811-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

    "Press and hold Push Plate Descending Button (5 in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) to descend the plunger until the buffer fills the chip and drips from Inlet port 2, Outlet port 1, Outlet port 2, and Outlet port 3.\nCritical: Make sure there is no air left in the chip.\nKeep feeding the buffer in the system for more than 10 min.\nCritical: Successful cell sorting may not be achieved with a shorter conditioning time.\nSample filling\nTiming: 5 min\nThis section introduces sample setting.\nNote: Sample must be equilibrated at room temperature.\nTake out the shorter tube (sample tube) from a tube set and connect it to a syringe.\nNote: There are two tubes in the kit, one for buffer and the other for sample. Be sure to use the shorter one for sample.\nDraw the sample into the syringe in the same procedure as the buffer.\nInstall the syringe to Syringe Pump 2 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nPosition the sample tube near Outlet port 3 (not shown).\nClick the plunger Fast descending button of the sample on the software (6 in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nNote: Press once, and the push plate descends and stops when it touches the syringe plunger.\nPress and hold the fluid delivery button on the sample side until a drop comes out from the end of the sample tube (5 in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nEnsure Inlet port 2 is filled with buffer. Then, insert the sample tube into Inlet port 2.\nCritical: Ensure no air bubbles enter into Inlet port 2 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nMicroscope setting\nTiming: 5 min\nThis section introduces the setting of a microscope attached to the cell-sorting device.\nAdjust screen brightness with Brightness Adjustment Dial of the cell-sorting device located below the syringe pump compartment (not shown).",
