    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nThe LA-N cell lines were developed by R.C. Seeger around 1980 (Seeger et al., 1977[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], 1982[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). They are immortalized biopsies of neuroblastoma, from a 3-year-old girl (LA-N-2, Seeger et al., 1977[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) and a 4-months-old boy (LA-N-5, Seeger et al., 1982[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Most studies describing these cell lines had been performed in the 1980s and 1990s, and there is substantially more literature on LA-N-2 than on LA-N-5. Our own study (Lobentanzer et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) is the first take on LA-N cells using modern methods of molecular biology, most importantly, RNA sequencing. To our knowledge, these cell lines are the closest immortalized semblance of human cholinergic neurons that are currently available.\nDay 0: Seeding\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThis step prepares single wells of LA-N cells for experimentation on the following day. Depending on the duration of the experiment, choose a starting number of cells/well that enables near confluency at the end of the experiment. A good starting point are 200,000 cells in 1 mL of medium in the well of a 12-well plate (surface area 3.5 cm2); this amount will be used exemplarily in the following protocol and should be adjusted to the needs of the experiment. In this context, note that differentiation agents tend to slow the cells’ replication. Differentiation agents are defined substances – usually small molecules or peptides – that coerce cultured cells to undergo phenotypic changes. Well-known and widely used differentiation agents include retinoic acid, 5-azacytidine, and bro-mo-de-oxy-uri-dine (Crosland, 1996[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). Thus, the more differentiation agent is introduced, the higher the number of seeded cells should be. In this step, make sure that enough culture flasks are available for the total number of cells needed for seeding.\nNote: Before starting, prepare warm medium in sufficient quantity, hemocytometer, aspiration pipette, 12-well plates.",
    "Check the viability and confluency of cells in the culture flasks in an inverted microscope.\nCollect the cells from their culture flasks.\nNote: LA-N cells do not adhere very tightly to standard culture flasks, so they can be detached by pipetting along the wall of the flask with a standard 10 mL pipette (electric pipettor).\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 1,000 × g for 5 min. Discard supernatant. Resuspend cells in an appropriate amount of fresh warm medium (e.g., 10 mL).\nCount cells and optionally assess viability.\nNote: Cells can be counted traditionally in an inverse microscope, using a hemocytometer, and using Trypan Blue, which allows assessment of viability. Modern, digital cell counter solutions can assess viability automatically.\nDilute cell suspension to yield your desired cell concentration (e.g., 200,000 cells/mL) using fresh warm medium.\nSeed cells into 12-well plates using 1 mL of cell-containing medium (i.e., in our example, 200,000 cells/well).\nCritical: LA-N cells are sensitive to ambient changes, resulting in reactions to extended periods outside of the incubator, potentially impacting the results (growth slowdown due to stress, apoptosis). We recommend filling plates only with the amount of samples to be lysed in one sitting. After lysing a number of wells of a plate, do not replace the remaining cells into the incubator to be lysed at a later time. In our experiments, we kept the number of occupied wells per plate at four. That way, all occupied wells can be lysed with adequate speed (see the section on lysis for the exact procedure).\nTransfer to incubator and incubate 24 h at 37°C, 8% CO2.\nDay 1: Add Differentiation Agent\nTiming: 5 min",
    "LA-N cells undergo pro-cholinergic differentiation upon stimulation with neurokines such as CNTF, LIF, and IL-6, which can be measured by the elevation of CHAT and SLC18A3 mRNA. The individual responses of the different LA-N lines to the different neurokines can diverge, so a time-dose estimation is recommended when starting experimentation. In our study (Lobentanzer et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), we used CNTF, of which we used 100 ng/mL for LA-N-2 and 10 ng/mL for LA-N-5, informed by our time-dose experiments. For ease of reading, the following description will assume LA-N-2 conditions.\nNote: Before starting, pre-warm stock solution of differentiation agent (CNTF).\nVisually assert the condition of the culture in an inverted microscope.\nNote: For comparison, please refer to the cell culture images by the original creator (Seeger et al., 1977[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4], 1982[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) and the cell culture vendor (e.g., by the DSMZ at https://www.dsmz.de/collection/catalogue/details/culture/ACC-671[href=https://www.dsmz.de/collection/catalogue/details/culture/ACC-671] and https://www.dsmz.de/collection/catalogue/details/culture/ACC-673[href=https://www.dsmz.de/collection/catalogue/details/culture/ACC-673]).\nWith minimal disturbance, add pre-warmed aqueous CNTF stock solution to each well to yield a final concentration of 100 ng/mL. In our example with 1 mL of medium in the well and a stock solution of 25 μg/mL of CNTF, this equates to 4 μL of stock solution per well.\nReplace plates into the incubator and minimally disturb for the duration of the experiment.",
    "Critical: LA-N cells appear to react sensitively to changes in ambient temperature and/or CO2 content. Thus, it is recommended to keep handling time at an absolute minimum through thorough preparation and speedy execution of the steps. For this reason, it is also recommended to supply enough medium at the start of the experiment to enable survival until the end of experimentation. Medium can be replaced (optimally by partial replacement) during the course of the experiment, but the cells handle best if they are not disturbed at all during differentiation. Additionally, medium replacement requires the re-addition of differentiation agent to the fresh medium, introducing another experimental variable. For instance, a part of the CNTF peptide may have been taken up by the cells or degraded, and thus, re-introduction of an amount of fresh CNTF may increase its concentration. However, this may have unforeseeable consequences for the differentiation process and should be done in a reproducible fashion (quantity of replaced medium, exact time point).\nDay 5: Cell Lysis\nTiming: 15 min per plate\nThis step aims to accomplish a quick and thorough lysis of cells to enable accurate measurements of biochemical states. As LA-N cells grow in monolayer, lysis is most easily performed in situ by adding phenol/guanidinium thiocyanate solution (TRIzol) to the cell layer after removal of the supernatant. Depending on the quantitative requirements of subsequent analyses (protein, DNA, or RNA determinations), wells can be combined, taking care that the total amount of TRIzol per sample is 1 mL. For example: when combining two wells into one sample use 500 μL TRIzol per well, for combining four wells into one sample use 250 μL TRIzol per well, and so on. The following exemplary protocol assumes combination of four wells into one sample (i.e., 250 μL of TRIzol per well).",
    "The day of lysis can be modified to adjust for the experimental needs. To ensure minimal handling time and equal treatment of all samples, we adopted a cyclic washing/incubation/transfer protocol, using four wells of a 12-well plate. Each of the following steps is performed on each of the four wells in quick succession, going back to the first well after finishing the step at the last well.\nNote: Before starting, prepare warm PBS for washing, TRIzol, aspiration pipette, micro-pipettor and tips, sterile microcentrifuge tubes, ice box.\nAspirate cell supernatant (almost) completely and wash with 250–500 μL of warm PBS. Keep PBS in well until the other wells have been similarly treated.\nRepeat washing step (11) as often as desired (between 1 and 3 times), always keeping cells covered to avoid drying out.\nLysis step:\nAspirate as much of the supernatant as possible.\nQuickly add TRIzol (250 μL) to the well using a micro-pipettor with a slightly larger tip than needed, pipetting up and down until all cells are detached and largely dissolved.\nSet a timer to 5 min.\nCritical: This is the time-critical step, as the incubation with TRIzol at 15°C–25°C should be consistent between all samples/subsamples. The cyclic protocol using four wells was devised to allow step 13 to be performed on wells #2–4 in the incubation period of 5 min for well #1 (100 s to perform step 13 for each of the wells #2–4). Timers can be set separately for each well or cumulatively/alternating, as long as the incubation period can be adequately monitored.\nFor each well, after the lapse of 5 min of 15°C–25°C incubation (timer), transfer TRIzol containing the cell lysate to a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube and place on ice. Combine all wells belonging to one sample in the same tube.",
    "Store at −20°C for few days or directly proceed to RNA/protein isolation.\nPause Point: TRIzol lysate of cells can be stored at 4°C up to 12 h or at −20°C for up to a year.\nOptional: RNA Isolation\nTiming: 4 h\nThe TRIzol cell lysate can be a source of many soluble biologic materials of the cell, DNA, RNA, and protein. Exemplarily, we will describe RNA isolation as performed in Lobentanzer et al. (Lobentanzer et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). This inexpensive “low-tech” isolation yields high amounts of high-quality RNA and can be tailored to small RNA processing. However, it can be substituted by modern kit-based solutions, if so desired. This protocol is modified from the official instructions (http://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/trizol_reagent.pdf[href=http://tools.thermofisher.com/content/sfs/manuals/trizol_reagent.pdf]) for TRIzol issued by Thermo Fisher.\nThe amount of samples for parallel processing is primarily limited by centrifuge capacity. More importantly, the air-drying step requires high acuity to avoid over-drying of the pellet, and thus is a secondary limiting factor for isolation of lots of samples.\nNote: Before staring the procedure, prepare an ice box, chloroform, pure ethanol (ice cold), 70% ethanol (ice cold) in autoclaved Milli-Q H2O, microcentrifuge tubes for phase separation, fresh RNase-free tubes for storage of aqueous RNA solution, RNA workspace (RNase-free) including micro-pipettors, preferably inside a laminar flow hood. Set centrifuge to 4°C.\nOptional: Phase separation can be enhanced by the use of specialized phase separation tubes.\nOptional: The formation of a visible pellet at small amounts of RNA can be enhanced by the addition of 5–10 μg of RNase-free glycogen to the supernatant of the first centrifugation step. Glycogen does not interfere with most subsequent RNA analysis methods. It is recommended to check suitability for the actual planned analysis.\nOptional (If Samples Are Frozen): Retrieve TRIzol lysate from freezer and allow to thaw on ice.",
    "Add chloroform to TRIzol lysate at 20% of TRIzol volume (200 μL for 1 mL of sample). Shake manually and vigorously (do not vortex) for 15 s.\nAllow each sample to rest for 2–3 min at 15°C–25°C.\nFirst centrifugation: 12,000 × g, 15 min, at 4°C.\nRetrieve the top, aqueous layer, containing RNA, and transfer to fresh tube. 1 mL of TRIzol sample should yield approximately 500 μL aqueous phase.\nNote: At this point, the optional glycogen can be added.\nAdd to the 500 μL of RNA-containing supernatant 1–1.25 mL of pure ethanol (ice cold). Mix by inverting and incubate 10–15 min on ice to allow precipitation of RNA.\nNote: The isopropyl alcohol of the original TRIzol instructions has been replaced by pure ethanol in our workflow, facilitating the air-drying step due to its higher volatility. Final ethanol concentration in the precipitation solution should reach about 70%. See also the section on Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] for details regarding small RNA yield.\nSecond centrifugation: 12,000 × g, 10 min, at 4°C.\nWashing the pellet: discard the supernatant of the previous centrifugation step and wash the pellet, using 1 mL of 70% ethanol and a vortex apparatus, for approximately 10 s.\nNote: Addition of glycogen to the supernatant of step 19 can help with handling of the pellet, making it more visible at low amounts of RNA.\nThird centrifugation: 7,500 × g, 5 min, at 4°C. Transfer on ice to RNase-free section of laminar flow hood, avoiding all percussion that may disturb the pellet.\nAir-drying the pellet:\nUsing a suitable RNase-free micro-pipettor (or multiple), remove as much of the ethanolic supernatant as possible.\nKeep the microcentrifuge tube open inside the laminar flow hood, allowing the pellet to air-dry under close supervision.",
    "Critical: The pellet must not be allowed to dry completely, making it insoluble. Allow most of the residual water to evaporate without letting the pellet dry out. A suitable state for resuspension is recognizable via the “turning translucent” of the edges of the (formerly white) pellet. Due to this time-critical process, it is not recommended to dry too many pellets at the same time, necessitating a continuous or batch-wise process.\nAs soon as the pellet is quite – but not completely – dry, resuspend it in an adequate amount of RNase-free water (commercial or autoclaved Milli-Q), such that the concentration is in the range needed for subsequent analyses. For example, we usually resuspend using 30–50 μL of RNase-free water. Support resuspension and dissolution of the RNA by gently pipetting up and down.\nHeat the re-dissolved RNA inside the tube on a heating block, 10 min at 55°C–60°C.\nMeasure RNA concentration at a Nanodrop 2000 or a similar device, optionally aliquot and freeze the samples or directly proceed to further analysis such as RT-qPCR or next-generation sequencing.\nPause Point: Aqueous RNA in RNase-free water is stable for months to years at −80°C."
