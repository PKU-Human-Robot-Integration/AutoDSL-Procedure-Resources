    "All methods described here have been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for Human Research at the University of Texas at Austin.\n1. Stimuli Characteristics\nCreate object stimuli using open source images available through the Bank of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS). This database consists of standardized images used throughout visual cognitive experiments.  Download four images (e.g., ball02, book01a, brick, button03) with a high rate of identification (above 75%)20,21.  \nCreate motion stimuli using a modified version of the DotDemo script, which is available through the open source Psychtoolbox-3 set of functions operated via MATLAB, as well as the movie function available in MATLAB (see the Supplementary File).\nConfigure the dot field parameters according to the size of the presentation screen and viewing distance.  \nEnter 3600 for the number of movie frames. \nEnter 80 (in cm) for monitor width.\nEnter dot speed at 5°/s.\nEnter a dot limited lifetime fraction of 0.05.\nEnter 200 for the number of dots.\nEnter the minimum radius of the field annulus as 1° and the maximum as 15°.  \nEnter 0.2° for the width of each dot.\nEnter 0.35° for the radius of the fixation point.\nSpecify that white dots are used on a black background.\nExport the movie in .avi format.\n2. Visual Paradigm Design\nCreate paradigms via stimulus-presentation software. Generate fixation crosses with Courier New size 18 font, bold, and centered on the presentation screen.\nDesign the visual object paradigm without temporal jitter (i.e., consistent ISI values) by creating a black fixation cross on a white background presented for 500 ms, followed by one of four objects presented in randomized order: ball, book, brick, or button.  \nPresent each object for 600 ms (Figure 1A).  Show all objects 75 times, for a total of 300 trials and a paradigm duration of 5.5 min.",
    "Design the visual object paradigm with temporal jitter to consist of the same black fixation cross on a white background, shown for a period of 500 or 1,000 ms and followed by one of the four objects, lasting for 600 or 1000 ms (Figure 1B).  \nCreate four trials using stimulus-presentation software: a fixation cross with a duration of 500 ms, followed by an object for 600 ms; a fixation cross with a duration of 500 ms, followed by an object for 1,000 ms; a fixation cross with a duration of 1,000 ms, followed by an object for 600 ms; and a fixation cross with a duration of 1,000 ms followed by an object for 1,000 ms.  \n\t\t\nRandomize these trials. Present each trial 19 times, culminating in 304 trials and resulting in a viewing time of approximately 7.85 minutes.\nCreate the visual motion paradigm without temporal jitter by generating a white fixation cross centered on a black background, lasting for 500 ms, followed by the visual motion movie, which is truncated to present for approximately 1,000 ms (Figure 2A). \nRepeat this sequence a total of 300 times, for a viewing duration of approximately 7.5 min.  \nCreate the visual motion paradigm with temporal jitter using the same fixation cross, lasting for intervals of 500, 750, or 1,000 ms.  \nAfter each fixation cross, present the visual motion movie with a duration of approximately 600 or 1,000 ms (Figure 2B).",
    "Create six trials: A fixation cross with a duration of 500 ms, followed by a movie for 600 ms, a fixation cross with a duration of 750 ms, followed by a movie for 600 ms, a fixation cross with a duration of 1,000 ms, followed by a movie for 600 ms, a fixation cross with a duration of 500 ms followed by a movie for 1000 ms, a fixation cross with a duration of 750 ms followed by a movie for 1,000 ms and a fixation cross with a duration of 1,000 ms followed by a movie for 1,000 ms.  \n\t\t\nRandomize these trials, with each shown 50 times.  Present a total of 300 trials, for a viewing period of approximately 7.75 min.\n3. Participant Consent, Case History, and Vision Screening\nGreet the participant on arrival. Obtain informed consent by presenting the participant with a consent for participation in research form. Explain the consent form to the participant and answer any questions that arise.\nHave the participant fill out a case history form that includes information on native language, handedness, hearing status, vision status, and other diagnoses the participant may have (e.g., psychological and neurological). Exclude participants who report hearing loss and/or neurological diagnoses, such as traumatic brain injury.  Include all other participants.\nEscort the participant out of the lab to complete a vision screening using a Snellen chart to determine visual acuity. Have the participant stand 20 feet away from the chart and begin by covering his or her left eye to determine right eye visual acuity, and then switch eyes to determine left eye visual acuity. Calculate visual acuity based on the smallest line of text that the participant can repeat at least one more than half of the total number of letters.",
    "NOTE: For example, if the participant repeats 5 of the 8 letters on the 20/20 line, visual acuity is calculated as 20/20 in that eye.\nEscort the participant into the EEG recording room. Have the participant sit in the designated chair in the center of a double-walled magnetic-shielded soundproof booth.  \n4. EEG Preparation\nMeasure the head circumference of the participant in centimeters and select the appropriate EEG net size. Measure and mark the midpoint of the scalp (midway between nasion/inion and right and left mastoids) for the placement of the reference electrode.\nPrepare a solution of warm water (1 L) mixed with baby shampoo (5 mL) and potassium chloride (11 g/10 cc), which increases the electrical conductance between the electrodes and scalp, leading to lower voltage impedances and an increased signal-to-noise ratio.\nPlace the EEG net in the solution. Allow the net to soak in the solution for 5 min before placing on the participant’s scalp.\nTurn on the stimulus-presentation computer and the EEG acquisition computer.\nPlace a towel or other absorbent material around the participant’s neck to prevent the solution from dripping onto his or her clothes. \nConnect the EEG net to the amplifier. Instruct the participant to close his or her eyes when putting on the EEG net to prevent the solution from dripping into his or her eyes.\nFirmly grip the EEG net with both hands and spread into place onto the participant’s head. Ensure that the net is placed symmetrically on the scalp head, with the reference electrode at the scalp midline point that was measured. Tighten the chin and ocular net lines to ensure a secure connection between the scalp and electrodes. Ask the participant if he or she is comfortable and if anything needs to be adjusted.",
    "Check for the proper electrode impedance values, with an average target of 10 kΩ.\nTo reduce impedance values following the placement of the electrode net, use a 1 mL pipette to apply the potassium chloride solution onto the scalp/electrodes that have a high impedance. Continue this process until adequate impedances values across the electrodes are achieved. \n5. EEG Recording\nInstruct the participant to focus on the visual stimuli that will appear on the monitor. The viewing distance is approximately 65 inches.\nUse a pseudorandom number generator to determine the order of presentation for the four visual paradigms. \nBegin the visual tasks and EEG recording.\nMonitor the EEG recording as necessary. If ongoing EEG shows high myogenic or 60 Hz activity, pause the experiment to recheck electrode-scalp connectivity.\nRepeat steps 5.3 and 5.4 for the visual object paradigm, the visual object with the temporal jitter paradigm, the visual motion paradigm, and the visual motion with temporal jitter paradigm.\nAt the conclusion of the experiment, instruct the participant to close his or her eyes in order to prevent the solution from entering his or her eyes when removing the net. Begin by loosening the chin and ocular net lines, then remove the net by gently pulling the chin strap up and over the participant’s head, making sure to pull slowly to ensure the net will not get tangled in the participant’s hair. \nDisconnect the EEG net from the amplifier. Begin the disinfection process by placing the EEG cap in and out of a bucket filled with water and rinsing under a faucet. Then, create the disinfectant solution by adding approximately 2 l of water to the disinfectant bucket and mixing 15 ml of disinfectant with the water.",
    "Immerse the sensor end of the net in the disinfectant. Set a timer for 10 min; for the first 2 min, continuously plunge the net up and down. Leave the net soaking for the remainder of the 10 min.\nRemove EEG net from disinfectant solution. Place the EEG net in and out of the electrode bucket filled with water and under running water to rinse. Repeat four times.  Allow the net to air dry. \n6. EEG Analyses\nExport EEG files for analyses in MATLAB via the EEGLAB toolbox using a 1 Hz high-pass filter, segmentation around each trial (or event) of 100 ms pre-stimulus and 500 ms post-stimulus periods.  \nImport data using the EEGLAB toolbox.  \nChoose the File option from the drop-down menu and click on Import data.  Select using EEGLAB Functions and plugins from the menu.  Next click on the appropriate export file format.\nRe-assign channel locations based on the type of electrode montage used by choosing Edit from the drop-down menu and selecting Channel locations.  Click on Look up locs and select the ellipses to locate the path of the electrode montage file of interest. \nAssign pre- and post-stimulus times to the epoch start and end times. Enter a value of -0.1 s in the Start time box. \nBaseline-correct data according to the pre-stimulus interval.\nIdentify and remove bad channels using probability at a Z-score threshold of 2.5. \nVerify successful identification and removal of bad channels by plotting all electrodes. Manually remove channels with mean voltage amplitudes outside of the range of +/- 30 µV.\nPerform artifact rejection by entering values of -100 µV and +100 µV.",
    "NOTE: This method is effective in the removal of ocular activity recorded at ocular electrodes (126, 127). However, it may be necessary to manually remove trials with artifact occurring at small-voltage amplitude (i.e., within the +/- 100 µV range) for certain participants. \n\t\nTake note of channels that were bad for entire segments (i.e., with voltages outside of the +/-100 µV range) and highlighted in red. Manually remove these bad channels if they constitute 60% or more of the rejected trials. Repeat this step as many times as necessary. \nFollow artifact removal steps as previously described. Ensure that a minimum of 100 sweeps are accepted. Remove trials marked for rejection.\nPlot channel 75 (equivalent to Oz), or the channel(s) of interest, to categorize morphological patterns. Prior to plotting this channel, make sure to perform pre-stimulus baseline correction.  \nChoose pattern A if CVEP morphology is characterized by a large positive peak at approximately 100-115 ms (P1), followed by a negative peak at approximately 140-180 ms (N1) and a positive peak at approximately 165-240 ms (P2).  \nChoose pattern B if CVEP morphology is characterized by a large positive peak at approximately 100-115 ms (P1), followed by a negative peak at approximately 140-180 ms (N1a), a positive peak at approximately 180-240 ms (P2a), then a negative peak at approximately 230-280 ms (N1b) and positive peak at approximately 260-350 ms (P2b).    \nAppend individual datasets together according to the morphological pattern visually observed to create a group average. Name and save the newly merged dataset file.  \nView appended files as an average by plotting the channel(s) of interest.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
