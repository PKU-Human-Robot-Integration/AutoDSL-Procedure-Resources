    "Collection of patient-derived surgical or biopsy samples directly from consenting breast cancer patients were carried out under approved human ethics protocol approved by the institutional ethic board. All mice used to generate patient-derived xenograft models were maintained and housed in an institution approved animal facility. The tumor tissue from patient-derived xenograft models using mice were generated as per approved ethics protocol approved by the institutional animal care committee.\n1. Preparation of cell lines\nPerform all cell culture and staining procedures under sterile conditions in a biosafety cabinet. Use sterile cell culture dishes/flasks and reagents.\nMaintain human breast cancer cells at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in defined media supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) and necessary growth factors specific to each cell line.\nMaintain mouse NIH3T3 fibroblast cell cultures (for use in colony forming assays) at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS.\nFor all cultures, replenish the old media every 2-3 days with fresh media. Once the cultures reach 75-80% confluency, subculture into multiple sterile cell culture flasks.\n2. Preparation of breast cancer tumor tissue\nCollect the patient-derived surgical or biopsy samples directly from consenting breast cancer patients under a human ethics protocol approved by the institutional ethics board.\nSubsequently, collect and generate tumor tissue from patient-derived xenograft models using mice under an animal ethics protocol approved by the institutional animal care committee.\nCollect all tumor tissues under sterile conditions into a 50 mL sterile conical tube containing 30 mL DMEM:F12 media, keep on ice, and process the samples as described below within 2 h of collection.\n3. Generation of single cell suspensions of breast cancer cells",
    "Aspirate media from the flask containing a monolayer of breast cancer cells that is 60-80% confluent (cell lines of choice). Wash the cells with 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Aspirate PBS and add appropriate cell dissociation solution (e.g., Trypsin:EDTA; just enough to cover the monolayer of cells) and incubate for 5 min at room temperature (recommended) or at 37 °C.\nAdd 5 mL of culture media to neutralize the activity of cell dissociation solution.\nTransfer the resulting dissociated cell solution to a 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 1000 x g for 5 min.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspended the cell pellet in 5 mL of 1x PBS. Count the cells using a hemocytometer and a microscope.\n\tNOTE: Observe for cell clumping in the hemocytometer. Repeat cell dissociation step if single cell suspension has not formed.\nAfter cell counting, re-centrifuge the cell suspension at 1000 x g for 5 min, discard supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in ALDH substrate buffer at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/mL.\n4. Generation of single cell suspension from tissue samples\nMince the tumor tissue with surgical blades using a crisscross technique to obtain smaller pieces of approximately 1 mm in size. Transfer the tissue pieces into a fresh 50 mL conical tube containing 10 mL dissociation buffer (1X Collagenase in DMEM:F12). Seal the conical tube with parafilm and incubate at 37 °C in a shaker incubator for 40 min.\n\tNOTE: If there is not a shaker incubator, place the tube in a 37 °C water bath and mix the tube by vortexing every 5-10 min.",
    "Pellet the digested tissue by centrifuging sample at 530 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and add 5 mL of trypsin. Pipette up and down using 1 mL pipette (set to 750 µL mark) to disrupt the pellet and incubate in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min. After incubation, pipette up and down vigorously to release single cells.\nTop up the total volume in the tube to 25 mL with DMEM:F12 media and centrifuge at 1000 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of dispase-DNase solution. Incubate in a 37 °C water bath for 5 min.\nTop up the total volume in the tube to 10 mL with PBS. Mix by pipetting up and down, pass the resulting cell suspension through a 40 µm cell strainer attached to a fresh 50 mL conical tube. Centrifuge at 1000 x g for 5 min.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of 1x PBS. Count the cells and complete preparation of the cell suspension as described in steps 3.4 and 3.5.\n5. Isolation of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs)\nLabel flow tubes for the unstained control, single cell staining controls (DEAB control, ALDH, CD44-PE, CD24-PE-Cy7, 7AAD), the negative control tube (stained with DEAB, CD44-PE, CD24-PE-Cy7 and 7AAD), fluorescent minus one (FMO) control and the ‘sort’ tube (stained with ALDH, CD44, CD24 and 7AAD).\nTransfer 500 μL (0.5 x 106 cells) of the cell suspensions from step 3.5 or step 4.5 to each tube that is labelled cells only, CD44, CD24 and 7AAD. Place the tubes on ice until use.",
    "Transfer 2 mL of sample (2 x 106 cells) to respective ‘ALDH’ tube. Add 5 μL of DEAB to the ‘DEAB control’ and ‘negative control’ tubes and cap it tightly. Add 10 μL of ALDH substrate to the ‘ALDH’ tube, mix well by vortexing, and immediately transfer 500 μL to corresponding ‘DEAB control’ and ‘negative control’ tube. Recap the ‘DEAB control’, ‘negative control’ and ‘ALDH tubes’ and incubate at 37 °C for 30-60 min (do not exceed 60 min).\n\tNOTE: The optimal incubation time may require optimization depending on the cell line. Always protect the ALDH substrate and the tubes containing stained cells from light.\nFollowing incubation, centrifuge all samples for 5 min at 250 x g. Resuspend the cells in 500 μL of ALDH substrate buffer. Add manufacturer-recommended or user-optimized concentration of anti-CD44-PE and anti-CD24-PE-Cy7 antibody cocktail and incubate at 4 °C for 30 min. Add anti-CD44-PE and anti-CD24-PE-Cy7 antibodies to respective ‘CD44’ and ‘CD24’ labelled tubes.\nFollowing incubation, centrifuge all samples at 250 x g for 5 min. Resuspend the cells in 500 μL of ALDH substrate buffer. Incubate the ‘negative control’ tube, ‘Sort tube’ and the ‘7ADD’ tube with 7AAD (suggested concentration: 0.25 µg/1 x 106 cells) for 10 min on ice.\n\tNOTE: The ALDH activity is detected in the green fluorescent channel, therefore a fluorochrome with a different compatible emission spectrum should be used. Where spectral overlap is observed during multi-parameter flow cytometry, single color controls and FMO control should be used as a guide to allow compensation between fluorochromes to minimize the spill over of fluorescent signal into other channels.\nSet up the analysis protocol on the FACS instrument in preparation for sample analysis. Create scatter plots (forward vs side scatter, forward scatter vs fluorescent channels).",
    "Using the unstained control, adjust the photomultiplier to separate debris from whole cell population and adjust the fluorescent voltage to move the whole cell population around the first log scale (101). Using the DEAB control, move the whole cell population within the second log scale (102) by adjusting the green fluorescent voltage channel.\nAnalyze all the single staining controls first (ALDH, CD44-PE, CD24-PE-Cy7) and 7AAD and FMO control, adjusting the voltage to separate stained from unstained cells and to minimize the spillage of fluorescent signals into other channels.\nGate on the positive population for each single stained cell sample. Using the negative control tube, gate for viability (7AAD negative), ALDHlow and ALDHhigh cell populations (representative gating strategy shown in Figure 1B).\nAnalyze multiparameter stained samples of interest to isolate BCSCs. Using the viable ALDHlow and ALDHhigh gates, select for CD44+CD24- (BCSC) and CD44-CD24+ (non-BCSC) cell population respectively (Figure 1B).\nCollect viable BCSCs and non-BCSCs in collection media in sterile collection tubes (populations from two representative cell lines shown in Figure 2A&B). Use sorted cells for downstream in vitro and in vivo assays as described below.\n\tNOTE: In addition to in vitro and in vivo assays described below, BCSCs can be validated by measuring the expression of pluripotent markers such as SOX2, OCT4 and NANOG via standard immunoblotting techniques.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61775/61775fig01.jpg",

(B) Representative FACS plots showing the sort strategy used to isolate viable BCSCs and non-BCSCs from a heterogenous pool of cells. MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells are concurrently labeled with 7-AAD, CD44-APC, CD24-PE and the ALDH substrate. Cell subsets were isolated using a four-color protocol on a FACS machine. Cells are selected based on expected light scatter, then for singlets, and viability based on 7-AAD exclusion. Cells are then analyzed for ALDH activity and the top 20% most positive are selected as the ALDHhigh population, while the bottom 20% of cells with the lowest ALDH activity were deemed to be ALDHlow. Finally, 50% of the ALDHlow cells are further selected based on a CD44low/-CD24+ phenotype, and 50% of the ALDHhigh cells are selected based on CD44+CD24- phenotype.

Colony forming assay\nResuspend the cells of interest (sorted cells from step 5.11 or unsorted cells from steps 3.5 or 4.5) in complete media.",
    "Label three flow tubes for 1 x 102, 2 x 102 and 5 x 102 cells. Add 2 mL of complete media and transfer the appropriate cell number (sorted from step 5.11 or unsorted cells from steps 3.5 or 4.5) in respective tubes. Mix the cell solutions thoroughly by pipetting it up and down 5 times.\nPlate the cells in a 6-well plate and distribute the cell suspension by gently swirling the plates to obtain uniform distribution of cells.\nIncubate the plates in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator until colonies appear (where colonies = ≥50 cells per colony). Carefully replenish media twice a week without disturbing colony formation.\nAspirate media and wash once with 1 mL PBS. Add 0.5 mL of 0.05% crystal violet solution into each well and incubate the plate for 30 minutes. Remove excess crystal violet stain by washing with 2 mL of water. Repeat the washing step until background staining has been removed.\nUsing a microscope at 4x and 10x magnification, count and record the total number of colonies generated (representative images shown in Figure 3A).\nCalculate the frequency of colony formation as follows: Frequency (%) = (# of colonies formed/number of cells seeded) x 100. For example, if 25 colonies are generated from 1 x 102 cells, then the Frequency of colony formation is, Frequency = (25/100) x100 = 25%.\nAlternatively, replace steps 6.1 to 6.4 with an alternate method involving co-culture with fibroblasts, which provide a microenvironmental support for BCSCs through production of necessary growth and survival factors.",
    "Pre-coat cell 60 mm culture dishes with type I bovine collagen (1 in 30 dilution of 3 mg/mL collagen). Allow collagen to polymerize for 30 min in a 37 °C incubator. Aspirate the unpolymerized collagen and wash the plate twice with 1x PBS. Cover the collagen-coated plate with 1 mL of PBS and set it aside at room temperature until use.\nLabel three flow tubes for 1 x 103, 5 x 103 and 1 x 104 cells. Add 4 mL of colony forming assay media and transfer the appropriate number of cells (sorted from step 5.11 or unsorted cells from steps 3.5 or 4.5) into the respective tubes. Add irradiated mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts (4 x 104 cells/mL of media). Mix cell solutions thoroughly by pipetting it up and down 5 times.\nAspirate the PBS from the collagen-coated culture dish from step 6.1 and plate the cell mixture onto each of the cell culture plates as described in step 6.3.\nIncubate the plates in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator and leave them undisturbed for 7-10 days or until colonies form, without replenishing the media. Count and record the total number of colonies generated as described in steps 6.6 and 6.7.\n7. Mammosphere assay\nResuspend the cells of interest (sorted cells from step 5.11 or unsorted cells from steps 3.5 or 4.5) in complete mammosphere media and plate cells at a seeding density of 5 x 102 cells/cm2 area in a 96 well ultra-low attachment cell culture plate.\n\tNOTE: Cell seeding density should be optimized for different cell lines.\nIncubate the culture plates for 5-10 days in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Carefully replenish media twice a week without disturbing mammosphere formation.",
    "After incubation, count the number of mammospheres generated in each well using a microscope; where mammospheres are defined as breast cancer cell clusters greater than 100 μm in diameter (representative images shown in Figure 3B).\nCalculate the mammosphere formation efficiency (MFE) as follows: MFE (%) = (number of mammospheres per well)/ (number of cells seeded per well) x 100 (i.e., if 5 mammospheres are generated by 1 x 102 cells in a well, then MFE = (5/100) x 100 = 5%).\nTo subculture mammospheres, carefully transfer the media containing mammospheres content into a fresh 50 mL conical tube and centrifuge media at 1000 x g for 5 min. Carefully remove the supernatant, resuspend the cell pellet in 500 μL of trypsin, and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of complete mammosphere media. Count the cells using a hemocytometer and re-plate the cells in an ultra-low attachment cell culture plate as described in step 7.1.\n\tNOTE: In addition to sub-culturing, the mammosphere-derived cells can be also analyzed further by FACS to assess BCSC phenotype and/or obtain pure populations of BCSCs for other downstream assays.\nTo determine the number of mammosphere-initiating cells contained within your cell populations, use an alternate method involving sphere limiting dilution analysis (SLDA). Plate cells in serial dilutions of high to low cell numbers in a 96 well ultra-low attachment cell culture plate, with the highest dilution resulting in less than one cell per well.\nIncubate the culture plate for 10-14 days in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and leave them undisturbed to avoid cell aggregation.",
    "After incubation, count the number of mammospheres generated in each well using a microscope; where mammospheres are defined as breast cancer cell clusters greater than 100 μm in diameter. Calculate the sphere-initiating frequency and significance using Extreme Limiting Dilution Analysis (ELDA) online software (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/).\n8. 3D culture model\nDepending on the experimental question, use basement membrane extract (BME) with or without growth factors (reduced). In order to evaluate the effect of individual growth factor on cancer cells, use growth factor reduced BME. It also helps in minimizing the non-specific effects of endogenous growth factors present in BME.\n\tNOTE: BME solidifies above 10 °C. Always keep BME on ice even during the thawing step.\nCarefully add 50 μL of BME per well in a 96-well plate without creating air bubbles and allow it to polymerize at 37 °C for 1 h. After 10 min of incubation, add 100 μL PBS to avoid drying of the gel layer.\nResuspend the sorted cells from step 5.11 or unsorted cells from steps 3.5 or 4.5 at a concentration of 5 x 103 to 5 x 104/200 μL in 3D culture media.\nOnce the BME has polymerized, remove PBS, add 200 µL of cell suspension to each well and incubate in 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Add PBS to the surrounding wells to avoid evaporation of the media.\n\tNOTE: The optimal number of cells for plating should be determined prior to setting of the experiment. Depending on the experimental question, BCSCs can be cultured alone or with other cells types (fibroblasts/endothelial/immune cells etc.).\nAdd fresh media to the culture plates twice weekly. Maintain cultures for 10-14 days prior to analyzing the formation of organoids (representative images shown in Figure 3C).",
    "For sub-culturing, carefully aspirate the media and add 200 μL of dispase to each well containing cells. Incubate the plate in a 37 °C incubator for 1 h. Halfway through the incubation period (30 min), take out the plate, gently pipette the dispase solution up and down 5 times, and place back in the incubator for a further 30 min.\nAfter 1 h, transfer the dissociated cell solution to a flow tube. Wash the well with 1x PBS containing 2% FBS (fPBS) and transfer it to the flow tube. Centrifuge the tube at 1000 x g for 5 min. Carefully aspirate the supernatant and add 500 μL of trypsin, incubate at 37 °C for 5 min. Inactivate trypsin by adding equal amount of fPBS and centrifuge at 1000 x g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of 3D culture media. Count the cells and re-plate required number of cells in the BME as in steps 8.2 to 8.4.\n\tNOTE: Multiple wells can be pooled to further analyze or sort the cell population of interest.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/61775/61775fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: In vitro assays to assess BCSC cell function. In vitro assays were performed as described in protocol sections 6.1 to 6.5 (A), 7.1 to 7.4 (B), or 81. to 8.4 + 8.6 (C).

    "9. In vivo xenograft model\nIn order to determine the tumor initiation capacity of breast cancer stem cells, prepare cells (sorted population from step 5.7 or unsorted populations from steps 3.5 or 4.5) using a limiting dilution approach. Serially dilute cells in PBS using between 1 and 5 different dilution groups, with doses as low as 0.01-0.2 x 102 cells/100 µL and as high as 1 x 106 cells/100 µL.\n\tNOTE: Unsorted/whole population cells can be used as a control. The number of dilution groups used will depend on the desired scientific outcome (e.g. if only testing tumorgenicity then 1 group at a higher cell number may be used, whereas when calculating tumor-initiating capacity, it is optimal to test 5 limiting dilution doses).\nTo generate xenograft models from human breast cancer cells, use immunocompromised female mice (athymic nude [nu/nu], nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient [NOD/SCID] or NOD/SCID IL2γ [NGS] strains).\n\tNOTE: Although a minimum of 4 animals per group can be used, 8-12 animals per group is recommended to obtain robust results particularly for limiting dilution analysis.\nPerform standard mammary fat pad (MFP) injections using 100 µL/mouse of each cell preparation, under sterile conditions in a biosafety cabinet.\n\tNOTE: For optimal breast tumor growth and spontaneous metastasis to distant organs, the thoracic MFP is recommended. Alternatively, the inguinal MFP can also be used.\nPost-injection, monitor the mice on a daily basis for general health and tumor growth at the site of injection. Upon detection of a palpable tumor, begin measuring the tumor size by calipers in two perpendicular dimensions and record weekly until endpoint.",
    "NOTE: The experimental end point is determined based on the regulations laid out the institutional animal ethics protocol; typically, endpoint by euthanasia is usually required once tumor volumes reach 1500 mm3. For BCSC populations and/or higher cell doses (e.g. >1 x 104 cells), this endpoint will likely be reached within 4-8 weeks of MFP injection. For very low cell doses and/or non-BCSC cell populations, tumor growth should be allowed to progress for up to 8 months post-injection.\nFrom these measurements, calculate the tumor volume using the following formula: Volume in mm3 = 0.52 x (width)2 x length. If using a limiting dilution approach, calculate tumor-initiating capacity and significance using ELDA online software (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/).\nAlternatively, to humanely extend the endpoint, surgically remove primary tumors and continue to monitor mice for health and/or development of spontaneous metastasis in distant organs. Use resected tumor tissue for the generation of serial xenotransplants.\nAt endpoint, harvest tissue from primary tumors and distant organs (lymph nodes, lung, liver, brain, bone) and carry out histopathological and/or immunohistochemical analysis or dissociated the tumor tissue and use in the in vitro assays described in sections 6-8.\nSubscription Required.
