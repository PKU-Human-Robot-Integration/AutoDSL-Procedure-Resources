  "procedures": [
    "Three automated TruTip extraction protocols are described and demonstrated here: 1) medium-throughput RNA extraction from NPA on an Eppendorf epMotion 5070; 2) high-throughput genomic DNA extraction from low volumes of whole blood on the Hamilton STAR, and 3) selective isolation and enrichment of fragmented fetal DNA from large volumes of maternal plasma on the Hamilton STARplus. Automated scripts are available from Akonni and only high-level program descriptors are provided here. The extraction and elution reagents are automatically dispensed from bulk reagent troughs to 96-well plates by the automated script(s) before the clinical samples are processed.\n1. Automated RNA Extraction from Nasopharyngeal Aspirate\nThe previously described manual TruTip method 15 is now adapted to run on an Eppendorf epMotion 5070 liquid handling robot, using a large pore TruTip matrix embedded in 1.0 ml Eppendorf pipette tips, a 2 ml deep-well plate (USA Scientific), Akonni TruTip extraction reagents, and NPA as the sample type. The epMotion 5070 liquid handling robot holds up to 8 tips simultaneously, so a baseline automated protocol is described for 8 parallel extractions. However, up to 24 samples can be processed during a single program in one deep-well 96-well sample plate. A separate epMotion program is available (and required) in order to process 16 or 24 samples. The protocol outlined below is for an 8 sample automated script.\nSetup\nBring nasopharyngeal samples to RT before starting the extraction.\nDispense 100 μl nasopharyngeal aspirate plus 150 μl nuclease-free water into column 1 of the sample plate (Figure 2A).\nPlace the sample plate into position B1 on the epMotion Worktable (Figure 2B).\nPlace pipette tips, TruTips and 30 ml reagent troughs onto their respective epMotion Worktable positions (Figure 2B).",
    "Open the Eppendorf epBlue software, select the Run file provided by Akonni for 8 samples, and load the method by clicking the RUN button on the RUN tab.\nUnder Level Sensor Settings, select Levels and Tips, and click the RUN button.\nInput the sample volume into the software and click RUN.\nThe epMotion script will prompt the user to add extraction and elution reagents to the reagent reservoirs located at position B2 on the Worktable. Add the recommended volumes of each reagent to the respective trough. For 8 samples, the minimum reagent volumes are:\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nReagent,Volume (ml),Trough Position\n95% ethanol,3.5,2\nWash Buffer D,9.0,3\nWash Buffer E,9.0,4\nElution Buffer A2,1.3,5\nLysis and Binding Buffer D,11.0,6\nInput the reagent volumes into the Table presented by the epMotion software during the prompt from Step 8 above. The input value should reflect the actual volume of buffer dispensed by the user into each respective reagent reservoir, and must be greater than or equal to the minimum volumes noted above. Incorrect volume entries could result in incorrect volumes delivered by the epMotion hardware to each tube or well in the 96-well plate(s).\nAutomated Program\nSelect RUN to start the automated method. The automated script will move through the following steps without user intervention:\nSample Lysis and Reagent Distribution:\nDispense 375 μl Lysis Buffer D into column 1 and mix for 10 cycles (apirate + dispense = 1 cycle). This step starts the lysis incubation process while the remaining reagents are aliquotted.\nDispense 1.6 ml Wash Buffer D into column 2.\nDispense 1.6 ml Wash Buffer E into column 3.\nDispense 50 μl Elution Buffer A into column 4.\nPause for 6 min to complete the 10 min sample incubation in Lysis Buffer D.",
    "Add 375 μl ethanol to each well in column 1, mixing each sample with ethanol through 10 pipetting cycles.\nExtraction:\nLoad 8 TruTips from position A2 on the Worktable, and begin the extraction process outlined in Figure 1.\nAspirate and dispense sample/lysis buffer/ethanol mixture from column 1 of the sample plate for seven cycles to bind the nucleic acid to the TruTip monolith. Although sample flow through the TruTip may vary (due to differences in clinical sample viscosity), nucleic acid yield for these sample was not affected by flow variation. Options for improving sample flow are described in the Discussion.\nMove TruTips to sample plate column 2, and cycle Wash Buffer D 5x over the monolith to remove residual lysis buffer and sample matrix.\nMove TruTips to sample plate column 3, and cycle Wash Buffer E 5x over the monolith to remove proteins and other contaminants from the bound nucleic acid.\nMove TruTips to the empty reagent reservoir position 1 (in Worktable location B2) and cycle 80x (at a fast flow rate) to dry the monolith. It is important to thoroughly dry the TruTip, as residual solvents in eluted nucleic acid preparations will negatively affect enzymes such as reverse transcriptase and Taq DNA polymerase.\nMove TruTips to sample plate column 4 and cycle 5x in Elution Buffer A. The extracted and purified nucleic acid is now in elution buffer in sample plate column 4 wells.\nEject TruTips into the epMotion waste bin.\nWhen the program is finished, manually remove the sample plate from the instrument and transfer the purified nucleic acid to new tubes for long-term storage or further use. Advanced epMotion users can add instructions to the Run file to transfer eluted samples into separate storage tubes or PCR plates, if desired.",
    "The program for 16 total samples will repeat steps 10.1 through 10.13 using sample plate columns 5-8. For the 24-sample program, steps 10.1 through 10.13 are repeated 2x using sample plate columns 5-8 and 9-12, respectively.\n2. 96-well Genomic DNA Extraction from Whole Blood\nA Hamilton STAR liquid handling robot is used to demonstrate automated extraction of 96 samples simultaneously from whole blood. The Hamilton STAR differs from the epMotion system in that an optional heater/shaker unit is available on the deck, which is important for enzymatic digestion of certain clinical matrices, such as whole blood. Because the system can be fitted with a 96-channel pipette head, there is a dedicated 96-well plate for each of the TruTip steps and reagents.\nSetup\nTurn on the STAR instrument and computer.\nOpen the Hamilton Run Control software.\nOpen the Run file provided by Akonni for 96 samples.\nPlace labware onto the STAR deck as shown in Figure 3.\nDispense reagents into their corresponding troughs (volumes denote the minimum required to process 96 samples):\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nReagent,Volume (ml),Trough Position\nLysis and Binding Buffer F,75,5\n95% ethanol,100,6\nWash Buffer J,175,7\nWash Buffer K,175,8\nElution Buffer A2,12,9\nProteinase K (20 mg ml-1),8,15\n6. Allow samples to equilibrate to RT.\n7. Place the sample tubes in the Sample Carrier racks (deck position 4 in Figure 3). Place Sample 1 in the rear of the far left carrier and move sequentially down each carrier with Sample 96 ending in the front right position.\nAutomated Program\nSelect the PLAY button in the upper left of the Run file window and input the number of samples being processed. The automated script will then move through the following steps without user intervention:\nSample Lysis and Reagent Distribution",
    "Transfer 200 μl from each sample tube to the incubation plate at position 14 on the heater/shaker module (Figure 3).\nDispense 80 μl proteinase K into each sample well of the incubation plate.\nDispense 600 μl Lysis Buffer F into each well of the incubation plate.\nMix the solution for 10 cycles, and then incubate for 20 min at 70 °C and 500 rpm. The 70 °C set temperature results in an ~60 °C sample temperature within the deep well plate, which is within the range of proteinase K activity. While the samples are incubating, the liquid handling system continues operating by dispensing reagents into their corresponding plates and wells:\n\t\t\n100 μl Elution Buffer A into each well of the deep well plate at position 13.\n800 μl ethanol into each well of the deep well plate at position 10.\n1.6 ml Wash Buffer K into each well of the deep well plate at position 12.\n1.6 ml Wash Buffer J into each well of the deep well plate at position 11.\nAfter the 20 min incubation, the sample mixture is transferred from the incubation plate to the deep well plate at position 10, and mixed through 12 pipetting cycles.\nEject reagent tips into the waste bin.\nExtraction\nThis portion of the gDNA blood procedure is very similar to the epMotion influenza protocol, except for the composition of wash reagents and cycle numbers. The Hamilton TruTips tips are black, so the flow of liquids through the TruTip is not visible.\nLoad 96 TruTips from deck position 3.\nAspirate and dispense the sample/lysis buffer/ethanol mixture in position 10 for 10 cycles to bind nucleic acids to the TruTip monolith.\nMove TruTips to position 11 and cycle Wash Buffer J 5x over the monolith to remove residual lysis buffer and sample matrix.",
    "Move TruTips to position 12 and cycle Wash Buffer K 5x to remove proteins and other contaminants from the bound nucleic acid.\nCycle the TruTip 40x at high speed to air dry.\nMove TruTips to position 13 and cycle 5x in Elution Buffer A2. The extracted and purified nucleic acid is now in elution buffer in the deep well plate.\nEject TruTips into the waste bin.\nWhen the program is finished, remove the Elution Plate from the instrument and transfer the extracted samples to the appropriate tubes for storage or downstream applications.\n3. DNA Extraction from Large Volume Plasma Samples\nThe Hamilton STARplus instrument is used to demonstrate an automated protocol for extracting freely circulating fetal DNA from 5 ml of maternal plasma. The STARplus system can support two automated pipette channel arms, one with 8 x 5 ml channels and one with 8 x 1 ml channels. These arms can operate in parallel for staggered processing in batches of 8 samples each. A 5 ml TruTip is used for the initial large-volume extraction, and a 1 ml TruTip is used for size separation and further concentration of the extracted nucleic acid.\nSet-up\nTurn on the STARplus instrument and computer.\nOpen the Hamilton Run Control software.\nOpen the Run file provided by Akonni for 8 large volume plasma samples.\nPlace labware onto the STARplus deck as shown in the Figure 4.\nDispense reagents into their corresponding reservoirs:\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nReagent,Volume (ml),Trough Position\nCN-W1,17,5A\nCN-W2,17,5B\nCN-W4,21,5C\nProteinase K (20 mg ml-1),5,6A\nEBB,17,6B\nEBA2,5,6C\nCN-W3,5,6D\nCN-B2,5,6E\nCN-B3,5,6F\nCN-L1,52,7\nCN-B1,175,8\nAllow sample to equilibrate to RT.\nPlace the sample tubes in the Sample Carrier racks (deck position 3 in Figure 4). Place Sample 1 in the rear and move sequentially toward the front of the deck.\nAutomated Program",
    "Because of the large input sample volume, lysis and homogenization steps must be performed off of the Hamilton STARplus instrument in a water bath. Steps requiring user intervention within the automated protocol are indicated with an asterisk (*) at the beginning of the sentence, and bold type.\nSample Lysis and Reagent Distribution: The sample is incubated with proteinase K and lysis buffer to homogenize the sample and release the DNA.\nSelect the PLAY button in the upper left of the Run file window. Input the number of samples being processed, the location of pipette tips on the deck, and the location of TruTips on the deck.\nThe automated script adds 615 μl proteinase K, 5 ml plasma, and 6.2 ml Lysis Buffer CN-L1 to each 50 ml conical tube, and will then PAUSE.\n*Remove the 50 ml conical tubes from the sample deck, vortex for 30 sec on high speed, and incubate off-line for 30 min at 60 °C in a water bath or heat block. After the conical tubes are removed from the Hamilton deck, RESUME the automated script to continue dispensing reagents into their respective plates and wells (Figure 4B and 4C):\n\t\n2 ml CN-W1 to every other well in position 9 column 1.\n2 ml CN-W2 to every other well in position 9 column 2.\n2 ml CN-W4 to every other well in position 9 column 3.\n250 μl EBA2 to every other well in position 9 columns 4 and 5.\n495 μl CN-B2 to every other well in position 10 column 1.\n1 ml EBB to every other well in position 10 column 2.\n500 μl CN-W3 to every other well in position 10 column 3.\n500 μl CN-W4 to every other well in position 10 column 4.",
    "50 μl EBA2 to every other well in position 10 column 5.\nBecause the 5 ml channels are too wide to use adjacent wells for each sample, the automated program dispenses reagents into every other well of the deep well plate in deck position 9. The mechanical arm used for the 1 ml channels also requires the use of every other well in reagent plates for the exclusion and concentration steps of the protocol.\nAfter dispensing reagents, the program will PAUSE.\n*After the 30 min, 60 °C incubation, place the 50 ml conical tubes on ice for 5 min.\n*Return the 50 ml conical tubes to their original positions within the sample carrier rack at deck position 4, and RESUME the automated script.\nAdd 12 ml Binding Buffer CN-B1 to each sample tube and mix 10x.\nLarge Volume Extraction: 5 ml TruTips are used for extracting total DNA from the lysed plasma sample.\nPick up 5 ml TruTips from position 2 for the large-volume nucleic acid extraction.\nCycle the sample mixture15 times in the 50 ml conical tube, starting at the bottom of the tube and moving 3 mm higher after each pipetting cycle. This step binds the total nucleic acid to the TruTip monolith.\nMove TruTips to the deep well plates at position 6 column 1, and cycle 1x in Wash Buffer CN-W1.\nMove TruTips to position 9 column 2 and cycle 1x in Wash CN-W2.\nMove TruTips to position 9 column 3 and cycle 2x in Wash CN-W4.\nMove TruTips to position 9 column 4 and cycle 40x at high speed to dry binding matrix.\nMove TruTips to position 9 column 5 and cycle 10x to elute the bound nucleic acids from the 5 ml TruTips. This is large-volume elution #1.",
    "Move TruTips to column 6 and repeat the step with the second aliquot of elution buffer. This is large-volume elution #2.\nTransfer elution #2 into position 9 column 5 to combine it with elution #1, and discard the TruTips.\nExclusion and Concentration: The high molecular weight DNA is removed from the extracted sample, and the remaining DNA is isolated and concentrated.\nAdd combined eluant from step 22 to position 10 column 1 and mix thoroughly 10x.\nPick up 1 ml TruTips from position 13 and cycle 20x to bind the high molecular weight DNA to the monolith.\nMove the TruTips to position 10 column 2 and cycle 5x to rinse the tip and remove high molecular weight DNA. The TruTips are retained and placed back in the tip rack at position 13.\nWith reagent tips from position 12, add 575 μl of Binding Buffer CN-B3 to the sample in position 10 column 1 and mix 10x.\nPick up the TruTips from step 25, return to position 10 column 1, and cycle 20x to bind the remaining DNA from the sample to the 1 ml TruTip.\nMove TruTips to position 10 column 4 and cycle 1x in Wash CN-W3 to remove any remaining inhibitors.\nMove the TruTips to position 10 column 5 and cycle 1x in Wash CN-W4 to rinse residual salts from CN-W3.\nRaise TruTips over position 10 column 5 and cycle air through the tips 35x to dry the monolith.\nMove TruTips to position 10 column 6 and cycle 10x in EBA2 to elute the purified, size-selected and concentrated nucleic acid.\nDiscard TruTips.\nTransfer the eluted sample from column 6 to 1.5 ml tubes in position 11. Extracted samples are ready for storage or downstream processing."
