    "Studies using human tumor specimens were reviewed and approved by the University of Iowa Institutional Review Board (IRB), protocol #201809807, and performed in accordance with the ethical standards as laid down in the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects participating in the study. Inclusion criteria include a diagnosis of cancer and the availability of tumor specimens.\n1. Plating intact PDOs in a 96-well plate\nPrepare reagents.\n\t\nPreheat 96-well plates at 37 °C overnight and thaw BME overnight at 4 °C.\nPrepare full organoid culture media optimized for culturing the cancer type of interest. Specific culture media used for experiments shown herein are provided in Supplementary Table 1.\n\t\tNOTE: Media components may need to be modified for different tumor types. For example, the organoid culture media is supplemented with 100 nM estradiol for gynecologic tumors13. Prepared media is stable at 4 °C for 1 month. For long-term storage, aliquot the media into 50 mL tubes and store at -20 °C.\nPrepare two separate aliquots of organoid culture media at 4 °C and 37 °C. For example, if 60 wells are being plated in a 96-well plate, use 6 mL of warm organoid culture media and 150 µL of ice-cold organoid culture media.\nPrepare organoid wash buffer: Supplement 1x PBS with 10 mM HEPES, 1x Glutamax, 5 mM EDTA, and 10 µM Y-27632. Store at 4 °C\nHarvest PDOs cultured in a 24-well plate. Perform all steps on ice or at 4 °C unless otherwise noted.\n\t\nAspirate media from each well using a vacuum line system.\nAdd 500 µL of ice-cold organoid wash buffer and gently pipette 2-3x using a 1000 µL pipettor. Incubate the plate on ice for 10 min.",
    "Transfer the contents of each well to a 50 mL conical tube. To ensure that all the PDOs are in suspension, rinse each well with an additional 300 µL of organoid wash buffer and transfer to the 50 mL conical tube. Centrifuge for 5 min at 350 x g at 4 °C\nAspirate the supernatant from the BME/organoid pellet using a vacuum line system, leaving ~ 5 mL remaining in the tube. Add 20 mL of organoid wash buffer and gently resuspend the pellet using a 10 mL serological pipette. Incubate on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 350 x g at 4 °C. Aspirate the supernatant with a vacuum line system, taking care not to disrupt the PDO pellet.\nPlating PDOs in a 96-well plate: Perform all steps on ice unless otherwise noted.\n\t\nResuspend the PDO pellet in an appropriate amount of ice-cold organoid culture media to create a PDO suspension. Transfer PDO suspension to an ice-cold 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\n\t\tNOTE: To calculate the amount of organoid culture media, determine the number of wells to be plated in a 96-well plate, taking into consideration that PDOs are plated in a 5 µL dome in a 1:1 ratio of organoid culture media and BME. For example, when plating one 96-well plate and using only the inner 60 wells, the total amount of PDO suspension needed will be 300 µL: 150 µL organoid culture media and 150 µL BME. For models that exhibit optimal growth at different percentages of BME, the ratio of BME: media may be modified in this step, though it is important to standardize the ratio across all assays for each specific model. To account for pipetting error, add 10% volume to each component.\nCount the number of PDOs.",
    "Transfer 2.5 µL of the PDO suspension to an ice-cold 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and mix with 2.5 µL of BME. Transfer the 5 µL mixture onto a clean glass microscope slide. Do not coverslip the slide. The mixture will solidify into a dome.\nVisualize using a bright field microscope at 4x. Count the number of PDOs in the 5 µL mixture; the goal is to have roughly 25-50 PDOs per 5 µL dome.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If the desired density is not achieved in the test mixture, adjust the final volume of the PDO suspension either by adding more organoid culture media or centrifuging the PDO suspension and resuspending the PDO pellet in a lower volume of ice-cold organoid culture media. Regardless of how the PDO suspension is modified in this step, the final ratio of BME: PDO suspension in step 1.5.3. should be 1:1.\nUsing a 200 µL pipettor with wide bore tips, carefully mix PDO suspension with an equal amount of BME to achieve a 1:1 ratio of organoid culture media to BME. Avoid bubbles, which will disrupt the integrity of the domes. \nUsing a 20 µL pipettor, seed 5 µL domes into the center of each well of a prewarmed 96-well plate, seeding only the inner 60 wells. To ensure equal distribution of the PDOs, periodically pipet the contents of the 1.5 mL tube with a 200 µL pipettor with wide-bore tips.\nAfter all wells have been seeded, place the lid on the plate and gently invert. Incubate the inverted plate at 37 °C for 20 min in the tissue culture incubator to allow domes to solidify.\n\t\tNOTE: Inverting the plate ensures that the BME/organoid culture media dome retains the 3D structure to provide adequate room for PDO formation.",
    "Flip the plate so that it is sitting with the lid up and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C.\n2. Treatments and the addition of fluorescent dyes for multiplexing\nWhile BME domes are solidifying in the 96-well plates, prepare dilutions of fluorescent live-cell imaging reagents. Specific parameters for multiplexing Annexin V Red Dye and Cytotox Green Dye are given herein.\nFluorescent reagent preparation (Day -1): Calculate the appropriate volume of organoid culture media based on the number of wells to be treated, assuming each well will be treated with 100 µL of dye-dosed media. Dilute dye in pre-warmed organoid culture media to the desired concentration.\n\tNOTE: The total amount of media needed will vary depending on the experiment. Add 10% to the final volume to account for pipetting error. For example, to treat the inner 60 wells of a 96-well plate, prepare 6.6 mL of dye-dosed media (Table 1).\nTreat each well with 100 µL of 2x dye-dosed organoid culture media. Add 200 µL of sterile 1x PBS to the outer empty wells of the plate. Incubate at 37 °C overnight.\n\tNOTE: PBS in the peripheral wells decreases the evaporation of media from the inner wells.\nAddition of drugs/treatment agents (Day 0): Prepare drugs in pre-warmed organoid culture media at a 2x concentration in a volume of 100 µL per well.\n\tNOTE: DMSO can be toxic to cells at high concentrations. A concentration of 0.1% DMSO is not exceeded in the experiments performed in this study. In addition to drugs, some fluorescent reagents are distributed as a DMSO solution. It is important to account for total DMSO concentration when working with such reagents.\nAdd 100 µL of 2x dye-dosed media to each well; avoid creating bubbles.\n3. Setting up imaging parameters",

    "NOTE: PDO size may vary significantly between different models and types. Use the measuring tool in the Gen5 software to determine the minimum and maximum PDO size thresholds for each model. Users may choose a smaller minimum PDO size threshold relative to the value provided by the measuring tool in order to prevent the exclusion of PDO fragments at later time points after drug treatment.\nTo limit the analysis to a certain region of the well, deselect Analyze entire image and click Plug. In the Image Plug window, use the drop-down menu to select Plug shape. Adjust the size and position parameters as necessary to fit the region of interest.\n\t\t\tNOTE: It is important to maximize the number of PDOs within the plug while also excluding PDO-free areas to minimize background. Designate a plug size that will consistently capture the majority of the objects of interest across replicates. Generating a plug that also excludes the edges of the dome is important as it excludes any objects that may appear distorted due to the refraction of light from the extreme curvature of the dome around the edges. Include primary edge objects may also be deselected to capture only entire PDOs within the plug.\nSubpopulation analysis.
