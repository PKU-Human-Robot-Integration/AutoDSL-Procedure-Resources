    "Maintenance of mESCsmESCs are routinely cultured on 10 cm dish pre-coated with 0.2% gelatin (see Recipes) in 10 ml of MES medium (see Recipes), in an 8% CO2 incubator at 37 °C (Figure1A).Medium is changed every other day. Note: Special attention should be taken to avoid confluency (> 70%) of mESCs (Figure 1B) in maintenance cultures as it might result in detrimental differentiation of the cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170810/20170810185955_9311.jpgFigure 1. Typical morphologies of mESCs. Feeder-free undifferentiated mESCs are shown at low 20-30% (A) and high 60-70% (B) density. Healthy, emergent mESCs grow as tightly formed, refractile colonies throughout passages (A). Over confluency (> 70%) of mESCs (B) creates flat colony morphology and potential differentiation.Exit from pluripotency assayCoat a 6-well plate with 0.2% gelatin (500 μl per well) and verify that the gelatin is well distributed. Place the plate in the incubator.Remove the media from a 50% confluent mESCs 10 cm dish. Wash once with 4 ml of 1x PBS. Add 2 ml of trypsin-EDTA to the cells and verify that the trypsin is well distributed. Place the cells back in the incubator for 5 min. Verify under the microscope that the mESC colonies are detached from the dish. Add 4 ml of MEF media (see Recipes) to the dish to inactivate the trypsin. Use a 5 ml pipette gently up and down to achieve single cells and move them in a 15 ml Falcon tube. Note: Try to achieve a single cell suspension and be careful to avoid too many bubbles.Count the cell density using a cell counter or equivalent method.Centrifuge 2 x 104 cells in a new tube at 190 x g for 5 min. Note: All centrifugations are carried at room temperature.Carefully resuspend the cell pellet using 2 ml of 2i + LIF media (see Recipes).",
    "Plate the 2 x 104 mESCs in 2 ml of 2i + LIF medium in the 6-well pre-coated plate with 0.2% gelatin. Medium is changed every other day.Notes:  Do not forget to remove the gelatin before plating the cells.The day on which the culture is started is designated as Day 0.After 3 days, aspirate the 2i + LIF media without perturbing the mESC colonies (Day 3) and add N2B27 media (without LIF nor inhibitors) for 4 days (permissive media). Medium is changed every other day.At Day 7, remove the N2B27 (permissive media) media without perturbing the mESC colonies and reintroduce 2i + LIF media for 3 additional days. Medium is changed every other day. On Day 10 alkaline phosphatase staining can be performed (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170810/20170810190239_9284.jpgFigure 2.

Wash once the cells with 1 ml of 1x PBS per well.Note: Be careful not to wash off the colonies from the plate. Fix the cells carefully for 45 sec with 0.5 ml fixative solution (see Recipes).Note: Prolonged fixation can destroy alkaline phosphatase activity. Wash the cells twice with 0.5 ml ddH2O.Note: Be careful not to wash out the colonies from the plate. Add 0.5 ml substrate solution (see Recipes) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark (either drawer or aluminum foil).Wash with 0.5 ml ddH2O.Let the plate air dry overnight in a drawer.",
    "Clonal alkaline phosphatase positive number quantificationEntire 6-well plates used for alkaline phosphatase staining are scanned with a printer/scanner machine to capture the total plate area in a single image (Figures 2A and 2C). More detailed images are also acquired with the microscope to better observe the morphology and alkaline phosphatase staining intensity in the different cell lines (Figures 2B and 2D).Scanned PDF images are converted into TIFF images with Adobe Photoshop CS6.Images are processed using ImageJ software 1.48v as follows:Number of alkaline phosphatase positive colonies is calculated on threshold intensity of inverted regions that are user–selected (full well–identical areas between conditions)Using the Analyze Particles tool (default parameters, ImageJ) the total number of alkaline phosphatase colonies is counted.Total number of alkaline phosphatase positive colonies is depicted in a graph as a clonal assay (Figure 2E)."
