    "All mouse experiments were approved by the Animal Care and Use Program at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with protocol number H0083R3. The NHLBI IACUC approved the protocol without analgesics.\n1. Hypothermia Anesthesia in Neonatal Mice\nSterilize sponges and surgical equipment in an autoclave before surgery. Prepare all the surgical materials and switch on a hot bead sterilizer 15-20 min in advance to reach 240°C to 270°C.\nTransfer all C57BL/6 pups (age P1) from their nursing mother to a clean mouse cage with fresh bedding and nesting materials. Once the pups are taken into a surgery room, perform the apical surgery promptly to minimize their time spent separated from the mother and to reduce the risk of maternal cannibalization.\nPut sponges on an ice bed and then place one pup on the sponge for ~3 min to achieve hypothermia anesthesia. Confirm anesthesia by observing apnea and akinesia and pinching a rear foot. Check the status of neonates frequently because too little time will not make the pup akinetic and apneic, and an excessive duration of anesthesia can lower the survival rate12.\n2. Thoracotomy\nTransfer the pup from the ice bed onto a surgical benchtop area and use tape to immobilize its arms, legs, and tail in a supine position.\nDisinfect the chest using betadine and gently clean it using a 70% alcohol prep pad.\nMake a transverse skin incision along the forth intercostal area of the chest cavity using a Vannas Spring Scissor, and then blunt dissect the forth intercostal muscles to facilitate access to the heart.\n\tNOTE: Survival rates improve when blood loss is minimized during the surgical process.\n3. Surgical Amputation of the Heart Ventricular Apex",
    "By hand, gently apply pressure on the abdomen to exteriorize the apex of the heart. Absorb blood around the surgical area with sterile cotton-tipped applicators for clear visualization. For sham-operated control neonates, proceed directly to Step 4 (Suture and Recovery of Mice).\nUnder a magnifying lamp and using iridectomy scissors, gently perform piecemeal resection of the left ventricle (LV) until the LV chamber is exposed. Be careful to minimize the resected portions of the LV. Approximately 15% resection is necessary to achieve optimum exposure of the LV chamber.\nEnsure that the heart returns to the chest cavity once the LV chamber is exposed.\n4. Suture and Recovery of Mice\nSuture the ribs and muscles together to seal the chest cavity using sterile Proline 6-0 sutures, and then carefully close the skin incision site using skin glue.\nWarm the neonate under a heat lamp for ~3 min for recovery, and then clean the blood and glue traces using a 70% alcohol prep pad before reintroducing it to its littermates. Try to complete the whole surgical procedure within 10 min because minimizing the time spent separated from the mother improves pup survival after apical resection.\nFollowing each surgery, place the surgical tools in contact with the beads of the hot bead sterilizer for approximately 20 sec for complete sterilization. Allow the surgical tools to cool to RT before each surgery.\nAfter completing surgeries for all pups in a litter, mix the pups with the mother's bedding and excrement before returning them to the mother's nest.",
    "NOTE: Generally, ICR/CD-1 mice are better foster mothers than C57BL/6, but even among nursing mothers of the same genetic background, fostering instincts vary. If changing a nursing mother is necessary to reduce mortality by maternal cannibalization, remove the P0 pups to a nursing mother and then perform apical resection at P1. Only perform either the sham operation or the apical resection in one litter of pups, because mixing sham and surgical pups could decrease the survival rates of the surgical group of pups6.\n5. Post-Surgical Analysis\nOne day after surgery, monitor the pups, ensure that there is no difference between sham and surgical groups, and count the number of pups to measure the survival rate. If the surgeries are performed properly, the survival rates should be similar and greater than 60% in both sham and surgical groups.\nHeart isolation and fixation.\n\t\nEuthanize the pups at days 1 and 2 post-surgery via decapitation and day 21 post-surgery by CO2 with an assurance of death by cervical dislocation, then clean the chest using a 70% alcohol prep.\nIncise the midline skin and muscle of the chest and then open the chest.\nExcise the entire hearts from the thoracic cavity and fix the entire heart of each sample in 5 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde O/N at RT.\nOn the next day, transfer the samples to 70% ethanol. Samples can be stored up to one week before paraffin embedding.\nSlice 5-µm-thick paraffin sections through the entire ventricle and perform standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson's Trichrome staining to examine the regenerative response5, 7. Specifically, H&E stain is used to examine muscle replacement and Masson's Trichrome stain is used to examine fibrotic responses5.",
    "Select the area of interest and set up at least three foci per sample manually using a slide scanner. Image and analyze the staining slides at 40× magnification according to the manufacturer's instructions with default parameters.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
