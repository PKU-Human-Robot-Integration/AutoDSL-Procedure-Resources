    "Preparation of CITE-seq oligos and antibodies:\n As described in Stoeckius et al 2018 cell hashing manuscript:  https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-018-1603-1\nCITE-seq run:\n1.  Cell staining\n  o Obtain all single cell suspensions from different samples/conditions that will be multiplexed in the run. Keep samples in separate tubes until after cell hashing and shortly before loading cells into the single cell RNA-seq instrument. When aiming to super-load the same sample into one run, divide the sample up into equal proportions before staining with distinct cell hashing antibodies. Keep cell suspensions on ice \\(unless otherwise stated) at all times.\no Carefully count all cells to ensure accurate quantitation.\n• Make note of cell viability \\(>95%) and also include dead cells in the total cell count\\!\n• If you observe many dead cells, live cell enrichment \\(e.g. Dead Cell Removal kit) is recommended\\!\no Resuspend ~1-2 million cells in 100 µl Staining buffer \\(2%BSA, 0.01%Tween in PBS).\no Add 10 µl Fc Blocking reagent \\(FcX, BioLegend).\no Incubate for 10 minutes at 4˚C.\no While cells are incubating in Fc Block, prepare antibody-pool using 1-1.5 µg \\(or titrated amounts) of each CITE-seq antibody and 1 µg of single cell hashing antibody \\(pool).\no Add antibody-oligo pool to cells.\no Incubate for 30 minutes at 4˚C.\no Wash cells 3 times with 1 mL Staining buffer spin 5 minutes 300g at 4˚C.\no Resuspend cells in PBS and filter through 40 µm strainers \\(e.g. Flowmi cell strainer).\no Verify cell concentration by counting on hemocytometer after filtration.\no Pool all different samples/conditions at desired proportions and immediately proceed to next step.\nRun 10x Genomics single cell V\\(D)J assay according to manufacturer’s instructions with the following modifications:\n2. Guide-tag RT supplement\n  At reverse transcription step: spike-in the guide RT primer",
    "o Add 5.9 µl of 2 µM gd_RT_v4 primer in the RT reaction \\(0.12 µM final concentration). Subtract that volume from the water added to the cells.\n3. cDNA PCR additive\\(s)\n  At cDNA amplification step: spike-in additive primers to increase yield of applicable tag products\no Add 1 µl of 2 µM protein-tag additive,\no Add 1 µl of 1 µM hashtag additive \no Add 1 µl of 1 µM guide-tag additive \n4. Separation of tag and cDNA libraries\n  After cDNA amplification: separate protein tags and guide tags \\(~180-200bp) from cDNAs \\(>300bp)\no Perform 0.6x SPRI selection to separate protein and guide tags from full-length cDNAs.\no DO NOT DISCARD SUPERNATANT FROM 0.6x SPRI. THIS CONTAINS THE ADTs and hashtags\\!\n• Add 0.6x SPRI to cDNA reaction as described in 10x Genomics or Drop-seq protocol.\n• Incubate 5 minutes and place on magnet.\n• Supernatant contains ADTs and hashtags.\n• Beads contain full length mRNA-derived cDNAs.\no mRNA-derived cDNA >300bp \\(beads fraction).\n• Proceed with standard 10x V\\(D)J solution for cDNA sequencing library preparation.\no Hashtags, Protein tags and guide tags ~180-200bp \\(supernatant fraction)\n• Purify tags using two 2x SPRI purifications per manufacturer protocol:\n• Add 1.4x SPRI to supernatant to obtain a final SPRI volume of 2x SPRI\n• Transfer entire volume into a low-bind 1.5mL tube and incubate 10 minutes at room temperature. \n• Place tube on magnet and wait ~2 minutes until solution is clear. \n• Carefully remove and discard the supernatant. \n• Add 400 µl 80% Ethanol to the tube without disturbing the pellet and stand for 30 seconds.\n• Carefully remove and discard the ethanol wash. \n• Centrifuge tube briefly and return it to magnet. \n• Remove and discard any remaining ethanol. \n• Resuspend in beads in 50 µl water.",
    "• Perform another round of 2x SPRI purification by adding 100 µl SPRI reagent directly onto resuspended beads.\n• Mix by pipetting and incubate 10 minutes at room temperature. \n• Place tube on magnet and wait ~2 minutes until solution is clear. \n• Carefully remove and discard the supernatant. \n• Add 200 µl 80% Ethanol to the tube without disturbing the pellet and stand for 30 seconds.\n• Carefully remove and discard the ethanol wash. \n• Repeat wash\n• Centrifuge tube briefly and return it to magnet. \n• Remove and discard any remaining ethanol and allow the beads to air dry for 2 minutes\n• Resuspend beads in 45 µl water for each element captured \\(135 µl for example if you need to make protein-tag, hashtag- and guide-tag libraries). \n• Pipette mix vigorously and incubate at room temperature for 5 minutes. \n• Place tube on magnet and transfer clear supernatant into new tube.

    "• Protein-tag, hashtag- and guide-tag libraries can be pooled with cDNA sequencing libraries at different proportions depending on the size of the antibody and guide panels. Typically, to obtain sufficient read coverage for all libraries we sequence protein-tag libraries in 3-10% of a lane, hashtag libraries in 2-5% of a lane and guide-tag libraries in 5-10% of a lane with the remainder dedicated to the cDNA library."
