    "The experimental protocols in this study were approved by the Ethics Committee for Research with Human Participants of Bilkent University. All participants included in the study were over 18 years old, and they read and signed the informed consent form before starting the study.\n1. General design steps",
    "NOTE: Figure 1A (top view) and Figure 1B and Figure 1C (front and back views) demonstrate the laboratory layout; these figures were created with respect to the original laboratory setup and configuration designed for this particular study. Figure 1A shows the top-view layout of the lab. In this figure, it is possible to see LED lights on the ceiling and the actor cabinet. The blackout curtain system divides the room in half and helps light manipulation by preventing light from leaking into the front part of the room (Participant Area). Figure 1B presents the view of the laboratory from the perspective of the experimenter. The participant sits right in front of the OLED screen, and using the see-through display, they can watch the live actions performed by the actors. They give their responses by using the response device (a wireless mouse) in front of them. The experimenter can simultaneously watch the actor through the participant display (OLED screen) and the footage coming from the security camera. Figure 1C demonstrates the backstage of the study (Actor Area) with the security camera and the Actor personal computer (PC), which are not visible to the participant. The security camera footage goes to the Camera PC to establish communication between the actors and the experimenter. The Actor PC displays the block order and the next action information to the actor so that the experiment flows without any interruption. The actors can check the next action quickly while the participants respond to the action in the previous trial.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65436/65436fig01v2.jpg",

    "NOTE: Figure 3A shows the opaque usage of the OLED screen used in the study from the experimenter's view. To ensure opaqueness, the background of the screen is adjusted to white (RGB: 255, 255, 255), and all the lights in the room (both in the Participant Area and the Actor Area) are turned off. The participant sees the fixation before the stimuli. Figure 3B shows the transparent usage of the digital screen in the study from the experimenter's view. To enable transparency, the screen's background is adjusted to black (RGB: 0, 0, 0), and the LED lights on the ceiling are turned on. The participant watches the actor. Figure 3C shows the opaque usage of the digital screen in the study. To ensure opaqueness, the background of the screen is adjusted to white (RGB: 255, 255, 255), and all the lights in the room are turned off. The participant is presented with the evaluation screen to give a response. They need to drag the cursor to the top left or top right of the screen (one of the two response choices, either High or Low) using a wireless mouse. Their mouse trajectory and response time are recorded.\nConnect the microcontroller to the Experimenter PC.\nStore the scripts that run the experiment in the Experimenter PC.",
    "​NOTE: Figure 4A shows the backstage (Actor Area) during the experiment. The front lights of the room (Participant Area) are off, and the Actor PC is showing the name of the action that will be performed by the actor. Figure 4B shows the actor cabinet in which the actors can wait for their turn and change their outfits. The actor cabinet is not visible from the participant's view, and since a curtain system is used, the actors can use any entrance they want. During the experiment, the fluorescent lights displayed in the figure are off.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65436/65436fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: System and wiring diagram.

Programming of the experiment",
    "NOTE: Create three main experimental scripts (ExperimentScript1.m [Supplemental Coding File 1], ExperimentScript2.m [Supplemental Coding File 2], and ExperimentScript3.m [Supplemental Coding File 3]), as well as several functions (RecordMouse.m [Supplemental Coding File 4], InsideROI.m [Supplemental Coding File 5], RandomizeTrials.m [Supplemental Coding File 6], RandomizeBlocks.m [Supplemental Coding File 7], GenerateResponsePage.m [Supplemental Coding File 8], GenerateTextures.m [Supplemental Coding File 9], ActorMachine.m [Supplemental Coding File 10], MatchIDtoClass.m [Supplemental Coding File 11], and RandomizeWordOrder.m [Supplemental Coding File 12]) to perform the experiment.\nNOTE: Please refer to the related scripts for detailed explanations.\nRandomization of the trial and block orders\n\t\nDefine and create two functions to randomize the trial orders (RandomizeTrials.m) and block orders (RandomizeBlocks.m) that take the randomization parameters (such as the participant ID) as inputs and return an array of pseudorandomized sequences.\nSee the scripts RandomizeBlocks.m (lines 2-24) and RandomizeTrials.m (lines 3-26) for details on how the randomized sequences are generated.\nTracking of the response (RecordMouse, InsideRoi)\n\t\nCreate a function that tracks and records the mouse trajectory of the participants and the elapsed time during the experiment (see RecordMouse.m).\nCreate a helper function to check whether the clicked coordinates lie inside the acceptable regions or not (see script InsideRoi.m).\nGeneration of textures for instructions and feedbacks (GenerateTextures.m, GenerateResponsePage.m)\n\t\nPrepare the instructions related to the experiment and the feedback related to the trials as images.\nSave the content of these images to a .mat file (see ExperimentImages.mat file [Supplemental Coding File 13]).\nLoad the .mat file into the workspace (see GenerateTextures.m line 25) after creating an on-screen window.\nCreate a separate texture and its identifier for each image (see GenerateTextures.m lines 27-165).\nDefine a function to draw the related response page textures for each experiment script (see GenerateResponsePage.m).\nConnecting the Actor PC to Experimenter PC over TCP/IP",
    "Create a TCP server socket in the script (see ExperimentScript2.m line 174) running on the Experimenter PC.\nCreate a corresponding TCP client socket in the script (see ActorMachine.m line 16) running on the Actor PC.\nSend information about the upcoming block/trial to the actors from the script (see lines 207, 229, and 278 in ExperimentScript2.m or see lines 136, 141, 153, 159, and 297 in ExperimentScript3.m) running on the Experimenter PC.\nDisplay the received information from the Experimenter PC on the onscreen window of the Actor PC (see lines 31-47 in ActorMachine.m).\nConnecting the microcontroller to the Experimenter PC\n\t\nConnect the microcontroller to a specific USB port (e.g., PORT 9) to control the state (either ON or OFF) of the installed LEDs backstage.\nEstablish a serial communication between the microcontroller device and the Experimenter PC (see line 185 in ExperimentScript2.m script).\nSend a logic high signal (1) to the microcontroller from the script running on the Experimenter PC (see line 290 in ExperimentScript2.m or see line 311 in ExperimentScript3.m scripts) to turn on the LEDs when the actions are being displayed via the USB cable.\nSend a logic low signal (0) to the microcontroller from the script running on the Experimenter PC (see line 292 in ExperimentScript2.m or see line 314 in ExperimentScript3.m scripts) to turn off the LEDs when the participant is expected to give a response.\n4. The flow of a sample experiment\nPre-experiment steps\n\t\nMake sure all the devices in the lab (Experimenter PC, Camera PC, Actor PC, and Participant Display) are powered by a UPS.\nLink the lightning microcontroller to the Experimenter PC through a USB cable, so it will automatically turn on as the Experimenter PC turns on.)\nTurn on the Experimenter PC, and check whether it is connected to 5 GHz Wi-Fi.",
    "Choose the sound device (the speakers in the Table of Materials) as the sound output device of the Experimenter PC.\nTurn on the participant display, and set the volume settings to 80%.\nSet the screen settings of the Experimenter PC for multiple monitors. Extend the display of the Experiment PC to the participant display. The display of the Experimenter PC will be 1, and the Participant Display will be 2.\nTurn on the Actor PC, and check whether it is connected to 5 GHz Wi-Fi.\nConnect the security camera to the Actor PC through a USB cable, so it will automatically be powered on as the Actor PC is turned on.\nTurn on the Camera PC, and open the camera application on the desktop. Make sure each actor, their movements, and their entry and exits to the cabinet are visible from the camera.\nMake sure all the computers, displays, and devices (the response device [wireless mouse of the participant], speakers, keyboard, and mouse of the Experimenter PC and Actor PC and the lightning microcontroller) work properly.\nWelcome the participant to another room; after giving brief information about the study, provide the consent form, and let the participant sign it.\nAsk the participant to draw a number from a bag, and tell them that the number will be their participant ID throughout the study.\nLet the participant fill out the online demographics form with their anonymous participant ID.\n\t\tNOTE: It is crucial that the participants do not see the actors before the experiment. So, this paperwork is completed in another room rather than the main experiment room so that the actors can take breaks between participants.\nThe experiment steps\n\t\nOpen the experiment software on the Experimenter PC, and open the ExperimentScript1.m script and run it.",
    "Fill in the participant ID and age; then, the script will start the first part of the experiment (the first visible stimulus will be a cross at the center of the Participant Display.)\nOpen the experiment software on the Actor PC, and open the ActorMachine.m script.\nPlace the Camera PC near the Experimenter PC, and make sure the footage coming from the security camera is not visible to the participant.\nWelcome the participant to the main experiment room, and let them have a seat in front of the participant display.\nTell the participant to arrange themselves such that the cross is in the middle and straight ahead.\nGive instructions about the parts of the experiment briefly by referring to the explanations and durations written on the whiteboard.\nTurn off all the lights in the experiment room.\nExperiment part 1:\n\t\nTell the participant that they will complete lexical/conceptual training in the first part of the experiment. Warn them about being careful to follow the instructions so that they can pass the training.\nTell the participant that the experiment can be started when they are ready.\nPress the ESC button when the participant says that they are ready for the first part.\n\t\tNOTE: From now on, the participant will progress through the experiment by reading the instructions on the Participant Display and selecting one of the choices. They will receive feedback regarding their right and wrong answers so that they can progress well in the training. The matching will continue until the participants reach the minimum threshold (80%) within 10 block repetitions.\nWhen the participant completes the training part, press the ESC button, and tell the participant that the experimenter is taking control of the mouse to start the second part of the experiment.\nExperiment part 2:",
    "Open the ExperimentScript2.m script, and wait for the prompt Waiting for the Actor PC.\nRing the bell when the prompt is seen so that one of the actors can run the script on the Actor PC to enable the connection with the Experimenter PC.\nWait for the prompt Experiment Part 2 is ready.\nTell the participant that now that the screen will be transparent while they watch some short actions through it.\nWarn them to watch each action carefully, and inform them that they should say what the action is out loud.\nTell the participant that the experiment can be started when they are ready.\nPress the ESC button when the participant says that they are ready for the first part.\n\t\tNOTE: The participant progresses through the instructions and watches the first action. Actor1 performs the actions when the LED lights are turned on, and they check the next action from the prompt on the Actor PC when the lights are turned off. When each action ends, a dialog box will emerge on the Experimenter PC screen.\nType what the participant says about the action in the dialog box, and type 1 or 0 in the second dialog box depending on the right or wrong identification of the action, respectively.\n\t\tNOTE: These steps will be repeated eight times for the first actor, and the background music will start to play when it is time for the actors to change places.\nWatch the backstage from the security camera footage on the Camera PC.\nPress the ESC button to start the identification for Actor2 when the actor waves their hands toward the security camera with the I am ready gesture.",
    "Repeat step 4.4.7 and step 4.4.8 together with the participant until the same eight actions are also identified while they are being performed by Actor2.\nWhen the participant sees the Identification is complete warning and exits the part by clicking on the arrow, press the ESC button, and tell the participant that the experimenter is taking control of the mouse to start the third part of the experiment.\nExperiment part 3:\n\t\nOpen the ExperimentScript3.m script.\nTell the participant that they will watch the actions of both actors, and then they will click on the option which they think is suitable.\n\t\tNOTE: The participants will evaluate the actions of the actors in four blocks. In two of the blocks, Actor1 will perform the actions, and in the other two, Actor2 will perform the same actions. In two of the blocks, the participants will evaluate the actions by attributing High or Low Agency capacities, and in the other two, they will attribute High or Low Experience capacities.\nPress the ESC button when the participant says that they are ready for the third part.\n\t\tNOTE: The participant progresses through the instructions, and they start with the first block. The actors perform the actions in the light, and while the participants give their responses, the screen becomes opaque, and the lights are turned off so that the actors can see which action is coming next. When each block ends, the actors will change places following the prompts on the Actor PC.\nCheck whether everything goes well backstage and whether the right actor is conducting the right action during the blocks.\nPress the ESC button to start the next block when the right actor waves their hands with the I am ready gesture after the replacement of the actors.",
    "Repeat step 4.5.4 and step 4.5.5 in cooperation with the participant and actor until the four blocks are complete.\nWhen the participant sees the The experiment is over, thank you prompt, press the ESC button.\nThank the participant, and after debriefing and taking signatures, send the participant out.\nFigure 5 shows a sample trial from the participant's view. Figure 5A shows the participant looking at the cursor at the center of the screen in its opaque usage. Figure 5B shows the participant watching the live-action stimuli through the screen. Figure 5C shows the evaluation screen presented to the participant after the stimuli, in which they need to drag the mouse to one of the two alternatives at each top corner of the screen.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65436/65436fig05.jpg\nFigure 5: OLED screen from the participant's viewpoint.

Data pre-processing and analysis\nSegmenting data into conditions\n\t\nRead all the participant data files into the workspace of the software environment.\nDefine the conditions to group the data (two action classes [Action Class1 and Action Class2] x two actors [Actor1 and Actor2] x two dimensions [Agency and Experience] x two levels [High and Low]).\nSegment the data into four main groups: Agency High, Agency Low, Experience High, and Experience Low.\nDivide these main groups into four subgroups (two actors x two action classes).\nLoop through each data file to group the trials that belong to one of the four previously defined subgroups.",
    "Store the relevant trial information (response time, cursor movement, and time points at which the cursor position is sampled) in separate data structures for each subgroup.\nExit the loop when all the trials are grouped.\nVisualization of the trajectories\n\t\nAfter segmenting the data, do the following steps to visualize the mouse trajectories.\nTo apply time interpolation to the response trajectories, for each trial, select 101 (x,y) pairs from the trajectory array so that each subgroup of data has trials with an equal number of time steps.\n\t\tNOTE: While anchoring the number of pairs to 101, make sure to follow the convention32to conduct correct time normalization. Hence, achieve time normalization using the following equation, where n is the number of samples in a trajectory array:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65436/65436eq01.jpg\nCompute the summation of (x,y) pairs at each of the 101 time points, and then divide the obtained result by the total number of trials of that subgroup to obtain the means for each sub-group (e.g., Experience Low Actor1 or Experience Low Actor2).\nApply a scaling operation to the row values to visualize the mean trajectories.\n\t\tNOTE: The 2D coordinate plane assumes that both axes increase from the zero point that is located at the bottom-left corner of the window (assuming the coordinates are positive integers), whereas the pixel format takes the upper-left corner of the window as the reference (e.g., zero point). Thus, apply a scaling operation for the y-coordinates (corresponding to the row values in pixel format) of the sampled locations by extracting the sampled y-coordinate of each trial from the value of the total number of rows.\nPlot the related subgroups in the same figure for comparison.",
    "NOTE: Each trajectory begins at the center of the rectangle located at the bottom center, labeled START, and ends inside the rectangles located in the upper-left or upper-right corners.\n6. Conditions that may lead to system failure and precautions\nNOTE: In the event of system failure, it is crucial to have a physical sign (ringing a bell) to let the actor know about the failure and warn them to stay in a place that is invisible to the participant.\nFailures due to network connection\n\t\nIf one of the computers is connected to a different network, the TCP/IP connection request will fail, and the system will show an error. To prevent this, make sure that the Experimenter PC and Actor PC are on the same band of the same wireless network.\nTo ensure that both PCs remain on the same network, erase previously connected wireless networks from both PCs.\nSet static IP addresses for the devices on the selected network since the IP addresses on a network may change without notice.\nAny momentary disconnection (e.g., due to a power outage, Internet outage, etc.) to the network may cause the script to fail. In these circumstances, the system needs to be restarted from the beginning to re-establish the TCP/IP connection.\n\t\t​NOTE: The requirement of static IPs for devices can be fulfilled by the Internet service provider. Certain ports might be disabled by the operating system or the hardware on a given device; hence, the ports that are to be used in the experiment must be opened and must not have an active connection until the experiment script launches.\nFailures due to software crashes",
    "The software environment may crash due to failed connections (e.g., serial port connection, TCP/IP connection, display connection, etc.), and this may lead to a loss of data. To overcome this, divide the main experiment script into multiple scripts. For example, if there is a block that needs to be completed before the actors start performing actions, there is no need to create a server on the Experimenter PC during this block. The server can be created when the block that involves actions, and, thus, requires communication between the Experimenter PC and Actor PC, is about to start.\nSubscription Required.
