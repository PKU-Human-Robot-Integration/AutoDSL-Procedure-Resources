    "The images of plant shoot apical meristem are first obtained under a DM2500 light microscope with 40-fold objective lens, and saved as BMP file using default parameters, usually the DPI of the image should be ≥ 72.Then the BMP file is opened by Photoshop CS6, and straightened by ‘Image Rotation’ function as shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130212505_1117.jpgFigure 1. Straightening picture via ‘Image Rotation’A line which is parallel with the horizontal axis is added to connect the part just above the first leaf primordium and its corresponding part in another side using the ‘Line tool’ (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130212548_0437.jpgFigure 2. A line just above the first leaf primordium is addedThe line and the picture are merged to form a merged picture using the function ‘Layer’ → ‘Merge Visible’.The merged picture containing the shoot apical meristem and the straight line is then extracted by ‘Magnetic Lasso Tool’ which is great for following the edges of an object. And they are copied to a new blank layer directly generated by ‘Control + N’ (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130212622_7279.jpgFigure 3. Extracted shoot apical meristemTo duplicate the resulting image, the new generated picture is then flipped by the command combination of ‘Image → Image Rotation → Flip canvas Vertical’ (Figure 4A) to produce a new vertical symmetric picture (Figure 4B). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130212820_1092.jpgFigure 4. Producing a new vertical symmetric picture of the extracted shoot apical meristemA new blank layer with the size at least could contain two of the extracted shoot apical meristem is first generated by command ‘Control + N’. The shoot apical meristem and its newly produced vertical symmetric picture are then put together (Figure 5A), and merged using the function ‘Layer’→ ‘Merge Visible’ (Figure 5B).",
    "Note: Before merging the two images, move the two images to get close to each other until there is only a thin line space left between the two images (Figure 5B). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130212856_4552.jpgFigure 5. A new picture consisted of the extracted apical meristem and its vertical symmetric image is formedThe merged picture is then extracted by ‘Magnetic Lasso Tool’, and is copied to a new blank layer automatically generated by ‘Control + N’ to make the extracted picture be included by the smallest rectangle (white) in the image (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130212934_4419.jpgFigure 6. The picture showed in Figure 5B is put in the smallest rectangleNote: The image boundary is exactly the smallest rectangle that includes the outermost boundary of the combined picture.The merged picture is then selected by ‘Magnetic Lasso Tool’ (Figure 7A), and is filled by a new solid black layer (Figure 7B) by the command combination of ‘Layer → New fill layer → Solid Color’.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130213011_1022.jpgFigure 7. The image showed in Figure 6 is filled by a new solid black layerThe new resulting picture is saved as a BMP file named ‘SF’ in the work directory. Here the directory is ‘I:\\Biotool’.Open ‘MATLAB’, and change the initial directory to your work directory, and build a subdirectory under your work directory, ‘Scripts’ for example here (Figure 8). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130213042_9365.jpgFigure 8. Set a work directoryPut MATLAB script, ‘profile.m’ (Supplementary files[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20170727/20170727030824_2836.zip]) under the ‘Scripts’ directory, and carry out the “profile” on the command line as follows (Shi et al., 2015):profile (1, 1, 'I:\\Biotool\\SF.bmp', 'I:\\Biotool\\edge_data.csv') After running the script, the user can obtain a ‘.csv’ file under the directory ‘I:\\Biotool\\’ named ‘edge_data’ which has stored the planar coordinates of the ‘SF’ picture boundary (Figure 9A). The user can also obtain the figure based on the extracted boundary as shown in Figure 9B.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130213217_3690.jpgFigure 9.",
    "‘edge_data’ (red rectangle) which has stored the planar coordinates of the picture (A) and the figure based on the extracted boundary (B) are obtained in this step Put ‘R’ scripts which are developed by Shi et al. (2015) basing on the superellipse equation proposed by Gielis (2003), ‘fit.sf.R’ (Shi et al., 2015), ‘optim.sf.R’ (Shi et al., 2015) and ‘simu.sf.R’ (Shi et al., 2015) under the ‘Scripts’ directory (Supplementary files[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20170727/20170727030824_2836.zip]). And open ‘fit.sf.R’, ‘optim.sf.R’ and ‘simu.sf.R’ via Notepad++. Change the directories indicated by the red arrows to your own directory (Figure 10).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130213405_5305.jpgFigure 10.

The solid dark line represents the observed out contour of the two combined shoot apical meristems; the red solid line represents the predicted ring. The dark dashed line represents the direction of major axis; the blue dashed line represents the direction of x-axis. And their theta which indicates the angle value between the dark dashed line and the blue dashed line was calculated and displayed in R console (Figure 12).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20171130/20171130213629_4800.jpgFigure 11.
