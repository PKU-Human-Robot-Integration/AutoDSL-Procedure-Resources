    "The protocol was developed within a European Delphi study10. The assessment of its application on patients was approved by the local research ethics committee of the Medical University of Vienna and carried out according to the Declaration of Helsinki. If not mentioned otherwise, the steps described here should be carried out by an occupational therapist or a physiotherapist.\n1. Pre-surgical interventions\nSee the patient for a multidisciplinary consultation.\n\tNOTE: The medical core team should include a surgeon, an occupational therapist and/or physiotherapist, a prosthetist, and a psychologist.\nCollect the patient history (reason and date of amputation, previous medical/therapeutic interventions after amputation, co-morbidities, general medical history, prosthetic satisfaction) and ask about expectations for prosthetic rehabilitation and demands for a prosthetic system in daily life.\nCheck for relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria.\n\t\nConsider the patient for TMR if they fulfill the following criteria: amputation above the elbow, good general health, personal desire for good prosthetic function, willingness to participate in post-surgical therapy for up to 15 months.\nExclude patients who have any untreated psychological co-morbidities.\nPerform a physical examination of the residual limb, focusing on skin and soft tissue problems, neuromas, range of motion, and possible additional nerve injuries.\n\tNOTE: If surgical interventions for the residual limb are needed (e.g., soft tissue corrections), the surgeon addresses them during TMR surgery.\nEvaluate the patient's general fitness regarding whether they will be able to carry a myoelectric prosthesis after TMR (~3 kg) and determine further interventions they may need during rehabilitation (such as strengthening the limb, exercises for endurance, or trunk stability). If the patient has a prosthesis, assess its function, preferably with standardized assessment instruments.",
    "Evaluate the patient's mental well-being and recognize psychiatric diseases, such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder (psychologist). If the evaluation shows the need for treatment, ensure as a team that the patient receives it.\nBased on the patient's needs, patient history, and examination, discuss available prosthetic options with the patient. Ensure that the patient understands that TMR involves a lengthy rehabilitation, where active involvement is needed.\nDetermine whether TMR is the best option for the patient. Provide the patient sufficient time to consider different options and/or discuss them with friends and family.\nSee the patient again (either in the full interdisciplinary team or as a rehabilitation professional with the surgeon) to plan the procedure unless the patient had already decided on TMR during the initial consultation.\nIf the medical team and the patient agree that TMR should be performed, ensure that financial reimbursement of the whole process is guaranteed and that rehabilitation and prosthetic fitting will be organized.\nSee the patient for therapy sessions before surgery. According to the patient's need, include exercises for pain treatment, endurance, body symmetry, trunk stability, strengthening of the limb and posture, and motor imagery tasks.\n\t\nAdditionally, train one-handed activities and support the patient with assistive devices, which can be helpful to support independence in activities of daily living.\n\t\tNOTE: At least one pre-surgical therapy session is recommended. More may be needed to address specific problems. If only a short time before surgery is available, include particular interventions in the post-surgical therapy.\nPerform the TMR surgery (surgeon)9.\n2. Early post-surgical interventions\nIn the first days after surgery, mobilize the patient and ensure that they regain their physical fitness. Once more, remind the patient that reinnervation might take ~ 3-6 months.",
    "NOTE: Early post-surgical interventions should happen once or twice daily while the patient is hospitalized. If the patient can perform the below-listed interventions by themselves after initial explanations, a therapy session once a month is sufficient and can also happen as teletherapy in an online setting. Otherwise, seeing the patient twice a week for 30-60 min is recommended.\nTreat possible edemas in the area of the surgery by bandaging, using custom-made liners, propping up the residual limb and/or offering lymphatic drainage. Ensure that the patient receives adequate pain medication.\nStart with scar treatment (scar cream application and scar massage) when the wounds are fully closed. Improve the range of motion in the shoulder joint for transhumeral amputations by passively moving the arm and instructing the patient to perform active exercises using the full range of movement.\n\tNOTE: The patients are asked to use the scar cream available to them; nothing specific is recommended.\n\t\nCommunicate all interventions with the surgeon and/or see the patient with the surgeon at least once.\nIf the patient had a prosthetic fitting before surgery, evaluate whether it can be re-fitted. If needed, have a prosthetist change the socket or replace the electrodes in a myoelectric fitting.\n\tNOTE: In some cases, a re-fitting of the socket might not be feasible.\nFacilitate the reinnervation process on a cortical level with methods such as mirror therapy11,12, imagined movements13, or lateralization training14 (or follow the structure of Graded Motor Imagery, which includes these interventions15) to activate the sensory-motor cortex areas responsible for the upper limb.\n\tNOTE: This enables the patient to activate reinnervated muscles more efficiently at a later point in therapy.",
    "For mirror therapy, set up a mirror in front of the patient and ask them to hide the residual limb behind the mirror. Instruct them to perform different movements with the healthy hand while watching its reflection in the mirror.\nAsk the patient to imagine different movements of the amputated hand and arm while keeping their eyes closed. If helpful, ensure that the patient can do this in a quiet, undisturbed environment.\nFor lateralization training, present the patient with cards that show either left or right hands and arms. Ask the patient to name the side and give the patient feedback on their choice.\n\t\tNOTE: If the patient prefers novel technologies, introduce the patient to computer programs or apps that provide the same function.\nContinue any pre-surgical interventions depending on the patient's needs.\n3. Signal training\nStudy the surgery report to understand which muscle parts are reinnervated and which nerves were transferred. Understand that the transferred nerve determines the motion(s) the patient needs to attempt to activate the reinnervated muscles (e.g., any muscle innervated by the ulnar nerve can be activated by imaging hand closing or wrist flexion after successful reinnervation).\n\tNOTE: If anything is unclear, meet the surgeon to discuss the nerve transfers and the rehabilitation plan.\nThree months after surgery, start testing for the first volitional contractions of the reinnervated muscles. If an activity can be found, continue with the steps below, and aim to see the patient for weekly or bi-weekly therapy sessions until surface EMG (sEMG) control is mastered. If no activity can be found, continue with the early post-surgical interventions, and perform another test a few weeks later.\n\t\nFor evaluating volitional muscle activity, set up a system for sEMG biofeedback.",
    "NOTE: Here, a system that can display up to six EMG signals and allow an individual amplification of each channel is preferred.\nPrepare the patient's skin to reduce impedance by removing excessive body hair, dead skin flakes, oil, or skin cream16. Explain the goal of the assessment and the functionality of the system to the patient.\n\t\tNOTE: Plan therapy sessions for 30 min or less at this stage. Otherwise, muscles may become easily fatigued, and the patient may lose needed focus. If short sessions are not possible, mix different therapy interventions (EMG and posture training) to avoid fatigue. Figure 2 displays a standard setup for EMG biofeedback training.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62896/62896fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Setup for surface EMG biofeedback. The therapist places an electrode on the patient's skin where the EMG signal is expected while explaining the needed movement cue (making a fist). The patient and therapist can see the patient's muscular activity (EMG) on the computer screen and use this feedback for finding the best electrode position and movement cue.

Consider reinnervation to be successful if the signal amplitude during activation is 2-3 times higher than during relaxation17.\nIf such activation is not possible, instruct other movements connected to the donor's nerve (e.g., flexion of the wrist or pinkie finger, if the ulnar nerve is the donor) and move the electrode slightly above the recipient's muscle.",
    "Repeat the evaluation for volitional activation with all nerves based on the surgery reports and note which muscles can be activated and with which motor command. Ask the patient to train the motor commands at home.\nTrain the selective activation of the reinnervated muscles.\n\t\nUse EMG biofeedback to display the activity of one muscle. Ask the patient to think of the previously evaluated movement patterns and use an sEMG electrode (see Table of Materials) to pick up the recipient's muscle signals.\nUse the notes from the previous evaluation. If easier for the patient, ask them to perform the desired movements bilaterally.\nAs soon as the patient can repeatably activate the muscle, train muscle relaxation as well.\n\t\tNOTE: Muscle relaxation corresponds to EMG amplitudes close to zero and is sometimes hard to achieve.\nAsk the patient to activate the muscle and fully relax it repeatedly. Make sure that there are 5-10 s of break in between the activations.\nInstruct the patient to perform different movements and vary electrode positions to find the combination leading to the highest amplitude (hotspot). Take a photo of the best position or mark it on the skin.\nIf more muscles can already be activated, train the activation and relaxation of each muscle individually.\nAfter a reasonable control of the single muscles is possible, display the activity of two muscles. Start with antagonistic muscles/movements such as hand opening and closing. Instruct the patient to activate one muscle while the other one should be as relaxed as possible.\nTry different movement cues for both muscles if such a selective activation is not possible. Explain to the patient that selectivity needs some training and make enough time for this step.",
    "As soon as the selective activation of two muscles is achieved, add a third muscle and repeat the previous steps. In the same way, add one muscle at a time until the patient can selectively activate each one. Plan several therapy sessions to train this.\n\t\tNOTE: To allow direct simultaneous prosthetic control at a later stage, the patient needs the ability to repeatedly activate each muscle while maintaining no/very little activation of all others. Figure 3 shows a schematic drawing of the excellent separation of six different signals in an EMG biofeedback system.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62896/62896fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Schematic drawing of the EMG signals displayed via biofeedback. Every channel (with a different color) is mapped to a specific muscle part and will later be responsible for a particular prosthetic movement. Good separation, as depicted here, ensures that the prosthesis only performs intended movements.

These systems are preferred for training as they enable more precise feedback.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62896/62896fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Patient controlling a table-top prosthesis with surface electrodes mounted on his residual limb. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62896/62896fig04large.jpg]\nFirst, only enable one prosthetic joint, e.g., the hand, and ask the patient to control it while carefully watching the prosthesis. If the prosthetic hardware allows it, explain to the patient that a low EMG amplitude corresponds to slow movement while fast movement is achieved through a high signal. Let them test different movement speeds.\nChange the active prosthetic joint (e.g., elbow joint or wrist) and let the patient control these levels with their EMG signals.",
    "Once a good control of the single levels is possible, switch on all prosthetic joints and enable simultaneous control. Instruct the patients that unwanted prosthetic movements are normal at this initial stage of prosthetic control.\n\tNOTE: A light activation of their muscles may support selective control of single prosthetic joints.\nWhen this is mastered, give the patient a first impression of grasping with a prosthetic device (the table-top prosthesis) by holding objects (small balls, tubes of bottles) close to the open prosthetic hand and asking them to close.\nIf they want, let the patient play with grasping and releasing objects they hold with their unaffected hand (for unilateral amputations). Let the patient know that sometimes failing to grasp or release objects is normal but should improve with training.\nEnsure that a certified prosthetist provides a test-fitting with all electrodes for myoelectric control placed in the socket correctly.\n\t\nTo support the correct electrode placement in the socket, mark the EMG hotspots on the patient's skin and note the prosthetic movements for each hotspot.\nIf possible, see the patient with the prosthetist for the plaster casting and answer any questions the prosthetist might have regarding electrode placement.\nWhen the first (test-) socket is ready, check its fit together with the prosthetist. Ask the patient to wear it and report any issues with the fitting (such as too much pressure at specific points). Check the electrode positions by connecting the electrodes in the socket to an EMG biofeedback system or a table-top prosthesis and asking the patient to control it.\nIf no sufficient control of the table-top prosthesis is possible when wearing the socket while it can be done with electrodes mounted on the skin, re-assess the electrode positions in the socket with the prosthetist and change them (and/or the socket) if needed.",
    "4. Prosthetic training\nOnce the (test-)socket fits well and the patient can control a table-top prosthesis with the electrodes embedded in the socket, ask the prosthetist to assemble the complete prosthetic fitting.\nSee the patient with their new prosthetic fitting together with the prosthetist and surgeon. Check the fit of the prosthesis, discuss with the team whether the changes are needed, and answer any questions the patient might have.\n\t\nExplain the basic functionality of the prosthesis to the patient, such as degrees of freedom, how switching between the active joints works (if needed). Also, explain whether the prosthesis is waterproof and how it should be cleaned.\nTrain donning and doffing of the prosthesis.\n\tNOTE: The duration and frequency of prosthetic training depends on the complexity of the prosthetic fitting, the therapist's experience, and the patient's motor learning ability. Needed changes in the socket (e.g., for electrode positions) may delay the training. In optimal settings, the patient attends therapy twice a week for 30-60 min in the first few weeks and has the option of using the test fitting for home training in between.\nTrain prosthetic movements without external objects.\n\t\nAsk the patient to perform easy movements of the prosthesis, such as opening/closing of the hand. If possible, connect the prosthesis via Bluetooth to its software to display EMG signals.\n\t\tNOTE: If the prosthesis does not react to the patient's motor commands or performs unintended movements, use EMG biofeedback to figure out the reason for this. If the problem is hardware-related (socket-fit or electrode placement), contact the prosthetist to solve this. Otherwise, try adapting the software settings and/or instruct the patient to adjust their motor commands (e.g., slighter contraction).",
    "Continue with training single movements of all prosthetic joints as described in step 3. If the prosthesis allows different movement speeds, instruct the patient to vary the speed of movement. Ensure that the patient is precisely doing what they intend to do.\nTo add more complexity, ask the patient to control the prosthesis in different positions (standing, sitting, or with varying shoulder positions for transhumeral amputees) and combine more degrees of freedom simultaneously (e.g., closing the hand flexing the elbow at the same time).\nTrain object manipulation\n\t\nProvide the patient with different objects such as stress balls or wooden blocks. Explain that the manipulation of objects adds another layer of complexity.\n\t\tNOTE: Normally, the patient needs to train for a while to have complete control over the prosthesis while working with external objects.\nAsk the patient to use their healthy hand (for unilateral amputees) to put the object into the prosthetic hand. Then instruct to close the prosthetic hand, move the prosthetic elbow and/or wrist joint and, finally to release the object.\nAs a next step, place the objects on the table/shelf/etc. Ask the patient to pick them up with the prosthetic hand and place them somewhere else.\nFinally, tasks that require more precision, such as stacking wooden blocks or grasping a ball rolling on a table, can be trained.\nTrain activities of daily living\n\t\nAsk the patient which common activities (such as carrying a bag, doing the laundry, cooking, dressing, eating with cutlery, opening/closing a door, etc.) they regularly do in their daily life. Prioritize a few of them and train them in therapy.\n\t\tNOTE: Discuss that the prosthesis cannot be used for bathing and showering.",
    "For training daily activities, suggest performing them with the prosthesis based on the experience (e.g., with some prosthetic hands, it is easier to pick up small objects if the hand is in a maximum pronated position). Let the patient perform the tasks based on suggestions provided. If they have other ideas on how to perform them, let the patient try their approach and encourage them to try many strategies and be creative.\n\t\tNOTE: It is essential to explain to patients that prosthesis training takes time and patience.\nGive the patient feedback on the performance during task completion. The feedback should be based on compensatory movements (little to none is preferred) and the patient's time to perform the task. If you or the patient are dissatisfied with how the task could be completed, try different strategies.\nAsk the patient which further, more specific activities are essential in their daily lives (e.g., sports, leisure activities, childcare or specific tasks required for their jobs) and discuss how they can use the prosthesis within these tasks.\n\t\tNOTE: If possible, directly train a few of these tasks with the patient during the therapy sessions (either in the clinic or at the patient's home environment). Not all tasks can be performed with a prosthesis. In some cases, specific prosthetic fittings or assistive devices are needed (e.g., for some sports or playing instruments). Although there were significant advances in recent years, prosthetic devices are still far from equivalent to human hands in function18.\nAsk the patient to use the prosthesis at home and make notes (or photos and videos) of tasks they are doing or they feel they cannot do.\nUse these notes to discuss different strategies for prosthetic use in the following therapy sessions.",
    "Repeat prosthetic training within the therapy sessions and at home until the therapist and the patient understand that the prosthesis can be used well in daily life.\nDischarge the patient from therapy.\n5. Follow-up assessments\nInvite the patient to a multidisciplinary medical consultation at 3 months after discharge from rehabilitation.\n\t\nAsk the patient how they use their prosthesis at home and work and discuss any problems.\nIf the patient reports any problems, discuss/provide solutions for them.\nAssess the patient's prosthetic function by using standardized tests (such as the Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP)19, the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT)20,21, or the Assessment of Capacity for Myoelectric Control (ACMC)22,23). Ask the patient to fill out standardized questionnaires for quality of life and hand use in daily life (such as Short Form 36 (SF-36)24 and Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)25).\nIf the test results show a problem, discuss this with the patient and offer solutions for their problems (if possible).\nAfter the first follow-up consultation, invite the patient every 6 months to a multidisciplinary consultation and structured assessments to ensure ongoing good prosthetic function."
