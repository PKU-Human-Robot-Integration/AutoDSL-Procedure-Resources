    "NOTE: All steps in this protocol are performed at room temperature (~20-22 °C) or in constant temperature incubators set to 16 °C or 20 °C. Male and hermaphrodite C. elegans are grown using standard culture conditions and NA22 or OP50 E. coli as a food source21,22. Wild-type N2 hermaphrodites and fog-2(q71) males are used in the procedure below.\n1. Day 1: Picking L4 Stage Hermaphrodites for Mating\nTo obtain consistent results, all hermaphrodites should be synchronized as actively reproducing adults. Pick 20-30 L4 stage hermaphrodites to a 6 cm seeded nematode growth medium (NGM) plate. Incubate the hermaphrodites at 20 °C for 28-30 h.\nNOTE: Only 12-15 hermaphrodites will be used for mating. The remaining hermaphrodites are surplus.\n2. Day 1: Staining of Males with Fluorescent Mitochondrial Dye (Mito-dye)\nMake a male staining plate by placing a dot of E. coli (food dot) at the center of an unseeded NGM plate. To make the food dot, use the end of a glass stirring rod to scrape E. coli from the bacteria lawn of a seeded plate and deposit it on the unseeded plate. The dot should be ~ 5-7 mm in diameter.\nMix together 2 µL of 1 mM mito-dye (see Table of Materials) in DMSO and 10 μL of M9 buffer (3 g of KH2PO4, 6 g of Na2HPO4, 5 g of NaCl, 1 mL of 1 M MgSO4, H2O to 1 L. Add MgSO4 after autoclaving). Pipette all of the mito-dye solution onto the food dot on the male staining plate. Let the plate dry in the dark (~30 min).\nNOTE: Mito-dye is light sensitive. Shield all solution, plates, and worms containing mito-dye from light. Store the 1 mM stock at -20 °C.",
    "Pick ~100 1-3 day old adult males23 to the mito-dye stained food dot on the male staining plate. Wrap the plate in aluminum foil and incubate overnight at 16 °C. For mating, use ~50-60 males per 12-15 hermaphrodites. If more than ~100 males are needed, make more staining plates to prevent overcrowding of males.\nNOTE: Males can also be stained by incubating in a 10 μM mito-dye solution in M9 buffer for 3 h on a watch glass. Keep the worms covered to prevent evaporation and light exposure. After 3 h, use a Pasteur pipet to transfer males onto a 10 cm seeded NGM plate. Transfer as little of the mito-dye solution as possible. Wrap the plate in aluminum foil and incubate overnight in 16 °C.\n3. Day 2: Mating\nPick the stained males from Day 1 onto a new, seeded NGM plate. Leave the plate in the dark until mating. This step ensures that excess mito-dye stained bacteria around the males are removed. Carryover of excessive mito-dye stained bacteria onto the mating plate can stain hermaphrodite tissue.\nMake a mating plate by dropping 2 μL of a thick E. coli mixture on an unseeded NGM plate. Let the thick bacteria dry to make the mating dot. Males and hermaphrodites will be transferred onto this dot for mating. To make thick E. coli, spin down 3 mL of overnight E. coli and resuspend the bacteria pellet in 1 mL of M9. This mixture can be stored at 4 °C and reused for up to 6 months.",
    "NOTE: The thickness of the E. coli solution may be adjusted. If the solution is too thin, males may crawl away from the mating dot instead of aggregating on it for mating. Mating dots made from an E. coli soluton that is too thick may decrease the mating efficiency.\nWhile the mating plate from Step 3.2 is drying, mix together 300 μL of 1% (w/v) Tricaine (Tri), 300 μL of 0.1% (w/v) Tetramisole (Tet), and 900 μL of M9.\nNOTE: Store 1% (w/v) Tricaine and 0.1% (w/v) Tetramisole as aliquotes at -20 °C. Avoid repeated freeze thaw.\nTransfer 600 μL of the Tet/Tri solution to a watch glass.\nTransfer 12-15 hermaphrodites picked on Day 1 to the Tet/Tri solution in the watch glass. Incubate for 30 min to immobilize the hermaphrodites. Keep the watch glass covered to prevent the Tet/Tri solution from evaporating.\nNOTE: It is important that hermaphrodites are anesthetized for at least 30 min. Less time could result in a moving worm during image acquisition, which can interefere with imaging.\nWhile hermaphrodites are incubating, pick 50-60 stained males from Step 3.1 onto the mating dot (Step 3.2). Store the plate in the dark until Step 3.8.\nAfter the 30 min incubation in the Tet/Tri solution, use a glass Pasteur pipet to transfer the immobilized hermaphrodites from the watch glass onto an unseeded NGM plate. Remove as much liquid as possible and let the excess liquid dry.\nNOTE: Do not let the hermaphrodites dry excessively. As soon as all visible liquid has evaporated, begin the next step.\nTransfer the anesthetized hermaphrodites from the unseeded NGM plate onto the mating dot with the stained males. Incubate in the dark for 30 min to allow the males to mate with the hermaphrodites.",
    "After mating for 30 min, mount the hermaphrodites immediately for time-lapse imaging or transfer the hermaphrodites onto a new, seeded NGM plate to rest for 1 h before imaging.\nNOTE: Time-lapse videos of the hermaphrodite uterus are used to quantify sperm velocity and reversal frequency. Still images of the uterus taken 1 h after mating are used to quantify sperm distribution, or spem guidance.\n4. Day 2: Mounting Worms for Visualization\nCreating a mounting pad with 2% agarose in H2O\nNOTE: 2% agarose can be made in bulk, aliquoted into glass test tubes, and stored at 4 °C. When needed, each aliquot can be microwaved before each use and stored in a heat block to prevent it from solidifying.\n\t\nTo make the mounting pad, align three glass microscope slides side by side with the long edges touching. Place two pieces of masking tape on top of each other on both of the outer slides. These outer glass slides with tape will act as the support so the thickness of the resulting agarose pad will be “two tape deep”.\nPlace ~75 μL of melted 2% agarose on the center slide (this is the slide without tape). Immediately place a new glass microscope slide on top of the agarose. This top glass slide should be perpendicular to the other slides, with each end resting on the tape of the two support slides.\nLet the agarose harden (~30 s). Carefully remove the top glass slide by sliding it off the agarose pad.\nPlace 10-15 μL of the Tet/Tri solution onto the 2% agarose pad. Transfer the mated hermaphrodites onto the pad. Take care to transfer as little bacteria as possible.\nPlace a cover slip over the worms on the agarose pad.\n5. Day 2: Image Acquisition Setup",
    "NOTE: Any upright miscroscope equipped with epi-fluorescence, 10x and 60x objectives, and a digital camera can be used to acquire images for sperm distribution. Software capable of acquiring time-lapsed images are required for assessing sperm speed, directional velocity, and reversal frequency.\nImage acquisition 1 h after mating\nMount the slide onto the microscope stage. Look through the eye pieces to scan for worms on the agarose pad using the 10x objective with the red fluorescence emission filter (TRITC filter). Once a worm has been found, briefly turn on the fluorescence light to see if the worm has mated. If sperm is visible within the uterus, switch to the 60x objective.\nNOTE: The pressure created by the 60x objective on the coverslip may damage some fragile worms, causing the intestine or gonad to extrude from the animal. Scanning for successful mating using the 10x objective can minimize the worms’ exposure to the added pressure. Do not expose the mated worms to extended periods of fluorescent light.\nUsing Differential Interference Contrast Microscopy (DIC), position the worm so that both the vulva and one spermatheca are in view. Focus the image by focusing on the center of the spermatheca. Check the exposure for both DIC and TRITC channels. In DIC, internal worm structures should be clearly visible. In TRITC, individual sperm should be visible as distinct puncta.\nNOTE: Each image should capture the uterus from the vulva to one of the spermatheca. If the uterus is too long to fit on one image, two separate images can be taken. It is not necessary for all of the images to be taken at the same exposure level. However, it is important that individual sperm can be distinguished and quantified in the fluorescence images.\nAcquire DIC and fluorescence images for each uterus.",
    "Repeat Steps 5.1.1-5.1.3 until all mated hermaphrodites have been imaged.\nCapturing time-lapse videos\nScan the agarose pad and locate hermaphrodites that contain labeled sperm within the uterus, as described in Step 5.1.1 and 5.1.2\nConfigure the software to acquire time-lapse images in DIC and TRITC channels. Generally, time-lapse images are taken at 15-30 s intervals for 10-20 min per uterus.\n6. Quantification\nQuantifying sperm distribution on uterus images taken 1 h after mating\nStarting with the vulva on one end and the spermatheca on the other, divide the uterus into thirds. These will represent the three zones. Zone 1 (Z1) contains the vulva and Zone 3 (Z3) contains the spermatheca.\nManually count the number of sperm within each third of the uterus, and report the number in each zone as a percent of the total sperm in the entire uterus. An example is provided below.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59783/59783eq1.jpg\n\t\tNOTE: Sometimes, the signal intensity of the TRITC channel image needs to be adjusted so that every sperm that has been captured in the image can be visible and quantified.\nTracking sperm in time-lapse images\nNOTE: In this paper, we used the NIS-Elements software for analysis. In the sections below, we give instructions for manually tracking sperm using this software (step 6.2.1) as well as the open source software ImageJ/Fiji (step 6.2.2).\n\t\nTracking sperm with NIS-Elements\nOpen the .nd2 file with the time-lapse series to be tracked. To begin tracking, open up the Tracking panel by right clicking in the software and selecting Analysis Controls | Tracking.\nIn the tracking panel, select Define New ROI. Define each region of interest (ROI) by clicking over each sperm that will be tracked. A colored mark will appear over the selected sperm. Click Finish when all ROIs have been selected.",
    "Once the ROIs have been identified, move to the next frame in the time-lapse series. Drag the ROI marker to the new position of the sperm in the image. Continue doing this until the sperm can no longer be tracked. Dotted lines will appear connecting each of the locations the ROI marker has been placed through all the frames of the time-lapse image.\nNOTE: Only sperm in Zone 2 should be tracked as sperm in Zones 1 and 3 tend to move in a circular pattern even in wild-type animals.\nExport all quantifiable data (e.g., path length, time, XY position, etc.) from the tracked sperm to an Excel document by clicking Export in the Tracking panel.\nTracking sperm with Fiji\nConvert the TRITC channel images in the time-lapse series to .tif files. Save all files from one series into one folder.\nImport the images to Fiji by using the BioFormats import function. Import images from one time-lapse series as one hyperstack.\nOpen TrackMate in Fiji24 via Plugins | Tracking | Manual tracking with TrackMate. A diaglogue box will open.\nSelect the TrackMate tool in the Fiji toolbar. Double click on the sperm that will be tracked. A green circle with dashed lines will appear. This circle may be repositioned by clicking inside the circle and dragging to the desired position. The size of this circle may be changed by simultaneously pressing the ALT key and scrolling the mouse.\nOnce the size and position of the tracker has been set, click on the circle again. The dashed green lines will turn into a solid green line. Simultaneously hit the SHIFT and L keys to turn on tracking mode. This will be indicated in the Fiji toolbar.",
    "Move to the next frame in the time-lapse series. To set the new location of the tracked sperm in the new frame, hover the mouse over the new point and press the A key. The tracker will now appear at the new location, and a line will appear connecting the locations where the tracker has been placed in the previous frames.\nAfter the traces have been completed, click Analyze in the TrackMate dialogue box to generate the data needed.\nTo calculate the speed, divide the total path length of the sperm by the elapsed time.\nTo calculate the vectorial velocity, draw a line through the uterus starting from the vulva pointing toward the spermatheca. Measure the distance the sperm has migrated along this line from the beginning to the end of the trace. Divide this distance by the elapsed time. Negative values indicate the sperm has migrated away from the spermatheca.\nTo record reversal frequency, count the number of times during which the sperm trace has generated an angle less than 90° during three consecutive time-lapse frames."
