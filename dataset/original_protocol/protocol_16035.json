  "procedures": [
    "This protocol describes greenCUT&RUN in human HeLa cell derivatives expressing the GFP-tagged protein of interest. This protocol requires only 250,000 intact HeLa cells per sample. The cells are first coated with magnetic concanavalin A beads to allow rapid subsequent washing steps. Next, the coated cells are permeabilized with digitonin-containing buffers to allow diffusion of the GFP nanobody-MNase proteins into the nucleus. In a separate step, the enzymatic activity of MNase is activated by millimolar concentrations of Ca++ ions, to allow chromatin cleavage and release of GFP-tagged complexes. Lastly, the DNA is purified from these chromatin complexes via phenol/chloroform/iso-amyl alcohol extraction, followed by ethanol precipitation. This is done because in greenCUT&RUN assays for transcription factors, only minute amounts of DNA are typically released and commercial DNA extraction kits do not perform well with such low amounts of small DNA fragments.\nMaterials\nMammalian cells expressing the tagged protein of interest (see Strategic Planning)\nPBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 14190-094)\nMammalian cell growth medium: DMEM with 4.5 g/L glucose (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 41966-029), supplemented with 10% FBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 10270-106) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (Merck, cat. no.

    "NOTE: Make sure all buffers and materials are at room temperature, except the 100 mM CaCl2 solution and digitonin buffer, which should be chilled to 0°C on wet ice before use.\nPreparation of concanavalin A-coated magnetic beads (time: 10 min)\nPrior to cell harvesting, concanavalin A-coated magnetic beads need to be activated by a short incubation with divalent cations. While we routinely perform this step just prior to cell harvesting, activated beads can be kept for 1 day on ice without loss in binding activity.\n1. Resuspend the 50% slurry of concanavalin A-coated magnetic beads by gentle vortexing and/or by inversion.\n2. Per sample, withdraw 20 μl of the concanavalin A-coated magnetic bead slurry (∼10 μl of packed beads) and transfer it to a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube.\nUse a cut-off tip for pipetting the resuspended beads.\n3. Add 1.5 ml binding buffer to the 2-ml tube and mix by inversion or gentle pipetting. Spin down the liquid from the cap and sides of the tube with a quick pulse on a microcentrifuge (<100 × g for ∼1 s at room temperature) and remove. Place tube on the magnetic stand until the solution is clear (1-2 min).\n4. Aspirate and discard the clear liquid and remove tube from the magnetic stand. Add 1.5 ml binding buffer, mix by inversion or gentle pipetting, and spin down the liquid from the cap and sides of the tube with a quick pulse on a microcentrifuge (<100 × g for ∼1 s at room temperature). Remove liquid. Place tube back on the magnetic stand until the solution is clear (1-2 min).",
    "5. Aspirate and discard the clear liquid and resuspend the beads in a volume of binding buffer equal to the initial volume of bead suspension (20 μl per sample). The concanavalin A-coated beads are now activated. Keep beads on wet ice until the cells are ready for binding.\nCell harvesting and binding to activated concanavalin A-coated beads (time: 60 min)\nTo minimize genomic DNA breakage throughout the protocol, we recommend avoiding rigorous resuspension and/or vigorous vortexing to prevent cavitation. Per GFP-tagged target and/or condition, we prepare two samples: The test sample and the no Ca++ control.\n6. Grow cells to 60%-80% confluency in a 10-cm tissue culture dish or T175 flask and harvest by trypsinization. Add mammalian cell growth medium to reach a 12-ml volume and transfer cells to a 15-ml centrifuge tube.\nAddition of growth medium after trypsinization will inhibit trypsin activity.\nWhen using FlpIn/T-REx derivatives, expression of the GFP-tagged target protein should be induced 15-24 hr prior to cell harvesting by addition of 1 µg/ml of doxycycline to a cell culture at 30%-40% confluency. Expression of the GFP target can be easily examined by fluorescence imaging using the Bio-Rad ZOE instrument or an equivalent microscope.\n7. Draw a 50-µl sample of the cell suspension and determine cell density using an automated Casy cell counter.\nIn our lab, we use the Casy cell counter according to the manufacturer's instructions but other cell counters (i.e., Bio-Rad TC20, cat. no. 1450102) or manual counting using a hemocytometer (Hirschmann, cat. no. 8100103) would also work.\n8. In the meantime, centrifuge the 15-ml centrifuge tube with the cell suspension (from step 6) at 600 × g for 3 min at room temperature and remove supernatant. Resuspend cell pellet in wash buffer to reach 1,000,000 cells per ml.",
    "9. Label two 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes, one for the test sample and one for the no Ca++ control sample. Dispense 250 µl (equivalent to 250,000 cells) of the cell suspension to each tube. Add 1.25 ml wash buffer at room temperature and mix by inversion or gentle pipetting.\nThe remainder of the cell suspension is not needed. Typically, a T75 flask yields 5-10 million cells and only a fraction of this is needed.\n10. Centrifuge tubes for 3 min at 600 × g at room temperature and aspirate supernatant.\n11. Add 1.5 ml wash buffer at room temperature and mix by inversion or gentle pipetting.\n12. Centrifuge tubes for 3 min at 600 × g at room temperature and aspirate supernatant.\n13. Resuspend pelleted cells in 1 ml wash buffer at room temperature by gently pipetting.\n14. Set vortex mixer at its lowest speed setting. While gently vortexing tubes at room temperature, add the activated concanavalin A-coated magnetic beads prepared in step 1-5 (20 µl of the 50% slurry in binding buffer).\nUse a cut-off tip for pipetting the resuspended beads.\n15. Rotate tubes 5-10 min at room temperature.\nThe cells are now coated with magnetic beads and are ready for permeabilization.\nPermeabilization of cells by digitonin and incubation with the GFP nanobody-MNase (time: 50 min)\n16. Place tubes with bead-bound cells (from step 15) on the magnetic stand until the solution turns clear (2 min) and then aspirate the liquid.\n17. Remove tubes from the magnetic stand and add 1 ml permeabilization buffer per tube to wash the bead-bound cells. Resuspend carefully with a 1-ml pipet tip. Incubate 3 min at room temperature. Place tubes with the bead-coated cells back onto the magnetic stand for 2 min and remove liquid by aspiration.",
    "The presence of EDTA in the permeabilization buffer removes excess divalent cations from the binding buffer, which were used to activate the concanavalin A. This is critical, because carryover of Ca++ ions can result in premature DNA cleavage after addition of the GFP nanobody-MNase protein. Chelation of divalent cations after cell permeabilization also serves to quickly halt most metabolic processes and prevent endogenous DNase activity. Washing out EDTA before GFP nanobody-MNase addition avoids inactivation of the enzyme as it is strictly dependent on millimolar concentrations of Ca++ ions. Spermidine in the wash buffer is intended to compensate for removal of Mg++ ions, which might otherwise affect chromatin properties.\n18. Prepare a 4 µg/ml GFP nanobody-MNase solution in cold digitonin buffer (100 μl is needed per incubation) and chill on wet ice until use.\nTo increase the read coverage at the binding sites of the target protein, two different GFP nanobodies-MNase fusions (enhancer-MNase and LaG16-MNase) can be combined. These GFP-nanobodies bind to different epitopes. In this case, use 2 µg/ml of each GFP nanobody-MNase fusion, such that the final concentration is 4 µg/ml.\n19. Place tubes with bead-bound cells for 3 min on wet ice to chill. Set vortex at low speed (∼1,100 rpm) and place each tube on it at a low angle. Add 100 μl cold GFP nanobody-MNase solution along the side of the tube, while gently vortexing to allow the solution to dislodge most or all of the bead-bound cells. Tap to dislodge remaining beads.\n20. Incubate 20 min at room temperature and flick the tube every 5 min.",
    "The high affinity of the GFP nanobody-MNase fusions for the GFP-tagged target (KD <1 nM) allows for short (20 min) incubation times. Increasing this incubation to 2 hr gives essentially similar results. When incubating for longer times at 4°C, flick the tubes every 5-10 min (also when incubating for 2 hr). We avoid using a rotator in this step because the bead-bound cells tend to stick to the sides and top of the tubes and run the risk of drying out.\n21. Spin down the liquid from the cap and sides of the tubes with a quick pulse (<100 × g for ∼1 s at room temperature) on a microcentrifuge, if necessary.\n22. Place tubes on the magnetic stand until the solution turns clear (∼2 min) and remove all liquid by aspiration.\n23. Add 1 ml cold digitonin buffer. Mix by flicking and inverting the tubes or by gentle pipetting using a 1-ml tip, if clumps persist. Spin down the liquid from the cap and the sides of the tubes with a quick pulse on a microcentrifuge (<100 × g for ∼1 s at room temperature).\n24. Place tubes on the magnetic stand until the solution turns clear (∼2 min) and remove all liquid.\n25. Add 1 ml cold digitonin buffer. Mix by flicking and inverting the tubes or by gentle pipetting using a 1-ml tip, if clumps persist. Spin down the liquid from the cap and the sides of the tube with a quick pulse on a microcentrifuge (<100 × g for ∼1 s at room temperature).\n26. Place tubes on the magnetic stand until the solution turns clear (∼2 min) and remove all liquid.",
    "27. Set the vortex mixer at a low speed (1,100 rpm). Place each tube at a low angle on it and add 150 μl cold digitonin buffer per sample along the side of the tube while gently vortexing to allow the solution to dislodge most or all of the beads. Tap to dislodge the remaining beads.\nTargeted chromatin cleavage by Ca++-activated MNase (time: 90 min)\nAt this point in the protocol, the GFP nanobody-MNase fusion protein has bound to the chromatin-associated GFP-tagged target protein but it is catalytically inactive due to the absence of Ca++ ions. It is crucial to chill the tubes to 0°C prior to addition of the CaCl2 solution.\n28. Place a metal block in wet ice. Insert tubes into the wells of the metal to chill the tubes to 0°C; this will take ∼5 min.\nIt is crucial that the tubes are chilled to 0°C as this will minimize secondary cleavages by released GFP nanobody-MNase/GFP-tagged target chromatin complexes.\n29. Add 3 μl ice-cold 100 mM CaCl2 to the test samples and 3 µl H2O to the no Ca++ controls. Mix by flicking or gentle vortexing of the tubes, and immediately place tubes back in the chilled metal block in wet ice.\nThis is crucial as the cleavage reaction now proceeds.\n30. Incubate tubes at 0°C for 30 min in the metal block in wet ice.\nOptimal incubation times for the cleavage reaction can vary and should be empirically determined. For NF-YA, we noted that 90-min cleavage reactions result in unacceptable secondary cleavages and in trimming of the chromatin fragments, while 10-min incubations did not cover all “true” peaks. As a guide, we recommend 30 min incubations.\n31. Add 100 μl ice-cold STOP buffer and mix by gentle vortexing.",
    "Heterologous spike-in DNA (1-20 pg per sample) should be present in the STOP buffer to calibrate DNA amounts during the bioinformatic analyses between the test and no Ca++ control samples, but also, for example, to compare different treatments or digestion time points. This is especially important for all CUT&RUN-based methods as there is too little background cleavage for normalization of samples.\n32. Incubate tubes for 30 min at 37°C to release the cleaved chromatin fragments from the insoluble chromatin.\n33. Centrifuge tubes at 16,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Place tubes on a magnetic stand for 2 min stand and proceed to the DNA isolation step.\nDNA isolation from released chromatin fragments (time: 1.5 hr)\nFor a quantitative recovery of DNA fragments of all sizes, we prefer DNA isolation from the chromatin fragments using proteinase K digestion and phenol/chloroform/iso-amyl alcohol extraction followed by overnight precipitation by ethanol. This retains the small DNA fragments of ≤80 bp, which provide the highest spatial resolution on transcription factor binding.\n34. Transfer supernatant (∼250 µl) from step 33 into a 1.5-ml safe-lock microcentrifuge tube. Be careful not to touch or transfer any bead-bound cells.\n35. To each sample, add 2.5 μl of 10% (v/v) SDS and 1.5 μl proteinase K (20 mg/ml). Mix by inversion and incubate 10 min at 65°C.\n36. Add 250 μl of phenol/chloroform/iso-amyl alcohol and mix by full-speed vortexing for ∼5 s. Centrifuge tubes for 5 min at 16,000 × g and room temperature.\nCAUTION: Phenol and chloroform are toxic, so they should be handled in a fume hood while wearing disposable gloves.\n37. Carefully transfer the upper aqueous phase to a 1.5-ml safe-lock microcentrifuge tube without disturbing the interphase. A small volume of the aqueous phase can be left behind.",
    "38. Add 250 μl chloroform to the aqueous phase, vortex 5 s, and centrifuge 5 min at 16,000 × g and room temperature.\n39. Add 2 μl of a 2 mg/ml GlycoBlue solution (freshly diluted in H2O from the 15 mg/ml stock solution) to a new 1.5-ml safe-lock microcentrifuge tube. Then transfer the upper phase into this safe-lock microcentrifuge tube.\nThe addition of glycogen increases the efficiency of ethanol precipitation of minute amounts of small DNA fragments.\n40. Add 500 μl of 99.8% ethanol and mix by vigorous vortexing for 5 s.\n41. Precipitate the DNA by placing the tubes at −20°C overnight (14-20 hr).\nLonger precipitations (e.g., over the weekend) are fine too.\n42. On the next day, centrifuge tubes in a pre-cooled microcentrifuge at 16,000 × g and 4°C for 20 min.\n43. Decant supernatant carefully and be careful not to dislodge the pellet, which is hardly visible at this stage.\n44. Rinse pellet carefully by adding 500 µl of 99.8% ethanol and centrifuge again at 16,000 × g and 4°C for 5 min.\nImportant: Be very careful not to lose the pellet as it comes off the sides of the tube easily at this step. Do not vortex at this step.\n45. Decant supernatant carefully and be careful not to dislodge the pellet. Air dry pellet for at least 5 min in order to remove the last traces of ethanol.\n46. Dissolve DNA pellet in 20 µl TE buffer by gently pipetting up and down.\n47. Measure DNA concentrations using a Qubit instrument. Proceed to library preparation. Alternatively, store samples at −20°C for library preparations at a later date (within 1 week).",
    "A characteristic of CUT&RUN protocols is that the amount of DNA recovered at this step is very low and even sensitive methods provide unreliable concentration numbers. For a typical transcription factor subjected to greenCUT&RUN, DNA concentrations will be in the range of 1-5 ng/µl, while for the no GFP or no Ca++ control, it will be ∼1 ng/µl. For GFP-tagged histone proteins, DNA concentrations range between 20 and 120 ng/µl.\n48. Prepare sequencing libraries using 0.5-10 ng of DNA and the NEBNext Ultra II library prep kit for Illumina from New England Biolabs following the manufacturer's instructions. In order to increase recovery of small fragments, however, implement the following modifications:\n         \nomit the size selection step to prevent the loss of small DNA fragments, which are the major contributor to high-spatial resolutions by CUT&RUN mapping methods;\nreduce the temperature and increase the incubation time of enzyme inactivation of the End Prep step of the NEBNext Ultra II protocol from 30 min at 65°C to 60 min at 50°C. This reduces the denaturation of small DNA fragments, which increases the efficiency of adaptor ligation to small DNA fragments;\nreduce the annealing/extension time of the PCR amplification step from 75 s at 65°C to 10 s at 65°C.",
    "Ca++ activation of the targeted MNase (Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-prot-0001], step 29) cleaves GFP targeted chromatin on both sides and this released complex could now digest freely accessible DNA (Skene & Henikoff, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-bib-0024]). In order to minimize such secondary cleavages, it is crucial to perform the digestion at 0°C and to limit digestion time. Suppression of secondary cuts is particularly important for abundant chromatin complexes like nucleosomes. Steven Henikoff and coworkers developed an alternate CUT&RUN protocol for (modified) histones, which exploits the inherent instability of nucleosome core particles in high-divalent/low-salt conditions (Meers et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-bib-0012]). This high-calcium/low-salt protocol reduces the risk of over digestion in standard CUT&RUN assays for abundant histone modifications like H3K27me3 (Meers et al., 2019[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-bib-0012]). MNase activation under these conditions results in cleaved chromatin, which is retained in the cells and requires 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM ethylene glycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), and 25 µg/ml RNase A to be released into the supernatant. Here, we provide the high-divalent/low-salt digestion procedure for greenCUT&RUN, which is useful for the genome profiling of GFP-tagged (mutant) histones. We note, however, that we have also performed greenCUT&RUN analyses of transcription factors like TATA-binding protein (TBP) and the A subunit of nuclear factor Y (NF-YA) using both Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-prot-0001] and Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-prot-0002], and found that both work equally well.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-prot-0001])\nLow-salt rinse buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-rec-0018])\nHigh-calcium/low-salt buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-rec-0016])\nNo-calcium/low-salt buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-rec-0022])\nEGTA-STOP buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-rec-0010])\nTargeted chromatin cleavage under low salt conditions by Ca++-activated MNase (time: 90 min)\n1.

    "2. Place a metal block in wet ice and then insert tubes into the metal block to chill down to 0° C (∼5 min).\nIt is important to chill the tubes to 0°C as this will minimize secondary cleavages by released GFP nanobody-MNase/GFP-tagged target chromatin complexes.\n3. Add 1 ml cold low-salt rinse buffer. Mix by flicking and inverting tubes or by gently pipetting using a 1-ml tip, if clumps persist. Spin down the liquid from the cap and the sides of the tube with a quick pulse on a microcentrifuge (<100 × g for ∼1 s at room temperature).\n4. Place tubes on the magnetic stand until the solution turns clear (∼2 min) and remove all liquid by aspiration. Place tubes back in the metal block on wet ice.\n5. Set vortex mixer to low speed (∼1,100 rpm). Place each tube at a low angle on the vortex mixer and add 150 μl high-calcium/low-salt buffer per test sample or 150 μl no-calcium/low-salt buffer per control sample along the side of the tube, while gently vortexing, to allow the solution to dislodge most or all of the beads. Tap to dislodge the remaining beads. Place tubes immediately back in the metal block in wet ice as cleavage starts immediately.\nAs a control for the cleavage reaction, we use a parallel incubation with no-calcium/low-salt buffer, but as mentioned, isogenic cells lacking the GFP-target protein perform equally well.\n6. Incubate tubes at 0°C for 30 min in the metal block on ice.",

Proceed with steps 34-48 of Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-prot-0001] for the isolation of DNA from released chromatin fragments and preparation of sequencing libraries.",
    "Genome-wide profiling by greenCUT&RUN requires purified GFP nanobody-MNase fusion proteins, which are not yet commercially available. We use two different nanobodies, recognizing non-overlapping GFP epitopes, and provide the protocols to express these proteins as a fusion to GST. The Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-prot-0003] results in high yields of GFP nanobody-MNase fusion proteins, which are free of contaminating DNase activities. The protocols can be performed in any molecular biology lab equipped with minimal protein purification equipment. The time investment for expression, purification, and activity assays per GFP nanobody-MNase is 6 to 8 days. The protocol can be scaled down easily but this does not result in a large gain in time.",
    "The protocol starts with a fresh colony of BL21(DE3) bacteria transformed with the pRPN-enhancer-MNase or pRPN-LaG16-MNase plasmid, which express the GFP nanobody-MNase as a GST fusion protein. A 1-L culture of bacteria containing the GST-GFP nanobody-MNase expression plasmids is induced at the proper density. The induced bacteria are then lysed by sonification and a clear lysate is obtained by centrifugation. The GST moiety of the expressed proteins allows efficient purification using glutathione affinity matrices and can be cleaved off by thrombin to release the GFP nanobody-MNase protein. The LaG16-MNase fusion requires solid-phase thrombin cleavage, while for the enhancer-MNase, both solid-phase and in-solution thrombin digestion work well (Nizamuddin et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-bib-0016]). The in-solution cleavage procedure allows better control of the optimal amount of thrombin but the procedure is more time and labor intensive. The glutathione affinity chromatography step combined with in-column thrombin cleavage already results in highly purified GFP nanobody-MNase preparations of reasonable concentrations. We prefer to clean up these preparations using a strong cation exchanger, which will remove low-abundant contaminants, including the inactivated thrombin. The enhancer-MNase (predicted pI 9.0) elutes at ∼330 mM KCl in the phosphate buffer of pH 7.0, while the LaG16-MNase (predicted pI 8.3) elutes at ∼225 mM KCl from the Mono S or HiTrap S HP matrices. Additional advantages of this cation exchange step are the increase in concentration and in specific activity of the GFP nanobody-MNase. After determination of nuclease purity and of GFP nanobody-MNase concentrations, glycerol is added to 55% and the preparation is aliquoted for long-term storage at −80°C. The expected yields from a 1-L bacterial culture are ∼15 mg for the enhancer-MNase and ∼5 mg for the LaG16-MNase protein. The obtained GFP nanobody-MNase preparations will be sufficient for many greenCUT&RUN assays as a single incubation only needs 400 ng GFP nanobody-MNase.",
    "Our purification protocol employs a low-pressure ÅKTAprime plus/ÅKTAstart or medium-pressure ÅKTApure chromatography system (Cytiva), but the protocol can be adapted easily to other chromatography systems, or even loading and elution by syringe. We include a simple assay for the GFP nanobody-MNase preparations to assess their specific activities. We do not provide a detailed protocol for protein analysis by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining as we expect this to be a standard technique for a molecular biology lab.

Inoculate a single colony of BL21(DE3) harboring the pRPN-enhancer-MNase or pRPN-LaG16-MNase plasmid from a fresh LB-ampicillin plate into a 100-ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 15 ml LB with 100 µg/ml ampicillin.\n2. Grow overnight at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm.\nThe next morning, the culture should be very cloudy.\n3. The next day, prepare 1 L LB medium supplemented with 50 µg/ml ampicillin and distribute it over two sterile 3-L Erlenmeyer flasks (500 ml each). Take a 1-ml sample to be used as a reference (blank) for OD600 measurements to follow the growth of the culture.\n4. Add 5 ml of the overnight culture (final dilution 1:100) into each flask.\n5. Incubate at 37°C with shaking at 200 rpm.\n6. At 1-hr intervals, draw a 1-ml sample to measure OD600 of the cultures against the reference (blank) sample.",
    "7. When the cultures reach an OD600 of 0.5-0.6, remove 1.5 ml from the culture and transfer it to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge at 6,000 × g for 2 min at room temperature in a microcentrifuge to pellet the bacteria. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 300 µl sample buffer. Keep this sample as the non-induced control at −20°C for analysis of protein induction by Coomassie staining of protein gels (step 21).\nTypically, it takes 4-5 hr for the cultures to reach an OD600 of 0.5-0.6. It is critical not to over grow the culture, as this severely affects expression of the GST fusion protein. If this happens, it is best to repeat the growth in the 3-L Erlenmeyer flasks on the next day, by starting at step 3.\n8. Add 500 µl of 1 M IPTG to each 3-L Erlenmeyer flask to induce expression of the GST-GFP nanobody-MNase protein.\n9. For the GST-enhancer-MNase, continue incubation in the incubator at 200 rpm for 3 hr at 37°C. For the GST-LaG16-MNase, cool the shaking incubator to 18°C and continue incubation overnight (16-20 hr).\nWhile the GST-fusion of enhancer-MNase is highly soluble upon bacterial expression under standard conditions, the GST-LaG16-MNase protein requires overnight induction at lower temperatures to maintain solubility.\n10. After incubation (for GST-LaG16-MNase, this will be the next morning) measure OD600. Take a 200-µl sample of the culture and dilute to 1 ml in LB medium before measuring.\nThe culture should have reached an OD600 >1.2.",
    "11. For later analysis by Coomassie staining of protein gels, take a 500 µl sample and transfer to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge tube at 6,000 × g for 2 min at room temperature to pellet the bacteria. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 300 µl sample buffer. Keep at −20°C for analysis of protein induction by Coomassie staining of protein gels (step 21).\n12. Transfer the bacterial cultures to 250-ml buckets and harvest bacteria by centrifugation at 2,000 × g (3,600 rpm in a Fiberlite F14-6 × 250y rotor) for 12 min at 4°C.\n13. Carefully decant supernatant and vortex pellet for 10-15 s to facilitate resuspension. Add 12.5 ml cold bacterial lysis buffer to each 250-ml bucket. Vortex pelleted bacteria until all clumps are resuspended.\n14. Combine bacterial suspension into one of the 250-ml buckets and divide suspension over four 50-ml conical centrifuge tubes. Keep tubes on wet ice from now on.\n15. Add 250 µl lysozyme (25 mg/ml) to each tube and mix by vortexing.\n16. Subject each 50-ml tube to three freeze-thaw cycles, which alternate between freezing in a dry ice/ethanol bath and thawing in a 16°C water bath. The bacterial suspension should become very viscous, which can be checked by pipetting. If the solution is not viscous and lysis is not apparent, repeat the freeze-thaw cycles. End with a thawed bacterial suspension.",
    "17. Sonicate lysate in each 50-ml tube three times for 20 s using a 7-mm tip at the maximum power setting. Keep tubes on ice during sonication and between cycles to prevent heating of the samples. The lysates should lose their viscosity. If this is not the case, repeat sonication for one to three cycles. Take a 50-µl aliquot of the lysate into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Keep at −20°C for analysis of protein induction by Coomassie staining of protein gels (step 21).\nMake sure to use a soundproof box and to wear ear protectors when the sonicator is switched on. Failure to do so may lead to permanent hearing loss. An alternative to freeze-thawing and sonication is lysis using a French press but we note that not all molecular biology labs have this instrument at their disposal.\n18. In order to remove insoluble proteins, bacterial debris, and non-lysed bacteria by ultracentrifugation, transfer lysates to SW 28 ultracentrifuge tubes. Combine lysates from two 50-ml tubes into one ultracentrifuge tube, which would result in two SW 28 tubes, with 25-30 ml of lysate each. Balance tubes carefully to a weight difference of <100 mg.\n19. Centrifuge tubes at 110,000 × g (25,000 rpm) and 4°C for 90 min in a precooled SW 28 rotor and ultracentrifuge.\n20. Transfer each clear supernatant to a 50-ml tube. Take a 50-µl aliquot of each lysate into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Keep at −20°C for analysis of protein induction by Coomassie staining of protein gels (step 21). Also, quick-freeze the clarified lysates in a dry ice/ethanol bath and store at −80°C until further purification.\n21. Analyze the expression of the GST-nanobody-MNase fusion proteins by loading:\n         \n20 µl of the total lysates (obtained in steps 7 and 11),",
    "5 µl of the sonicated lysate before centrifugation (step 17), and\n5 µl of the soluble lysate (step 20) on a 12% polyacrylamide/SDS gel.\nAdd 15 µl sample buffer to the sonicated and soluble lysates (step 17 and 20). Incubate all samples for 5 min at 95°C before gel loading. Perform gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining as detailed in Current Protocols article: Gallagher, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-bib-0004].\nAfter Coomassie staining of the gel, the GST-nanobody-MNase protein, with a mobility of ∼52 kDa, should be clearly present in the induced total lysate and in the soluble lysate (see Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-fig-0002] for an example), and it should represent 10%-20% of the total protein.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0f8f50a2-54d9-4bb8-86af-27eb2ed8ba02/cpz1266-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nCoomassie staining of a 12% polyacrylamide/SDS gel for analyzing the expression and solubility of the GST-LaG16-MNase protein following Support Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-prot-0003]. To the left are the sizes, in kDa, of the co-migrated marker proteins. The other lanes contain, from left to right: 20 µl of the non-induced total lysates (from step 7), 20 µl of the IPTG-induced total lysate (step 11), 5 µl of the sonicated lysate before centrifugation (step 17), and 5 µl of the sonicated lysate after centrifugation (soluble, step 20). The arrow indicates the position of the soluble GST-LaG16-MNase protein.\nPurification over glutathione resin and in-column digestion with thrombin (time: 2-3 days)\nIn this part, the GST-nanobody-MNase fusion is purified using glutathione-affinity chromatography. We prefer applying the bacterial lysate to a prepared glutathione column in a chromatography system rather than performing a batch-binding procedure. We find that batch binding results in partial capture of the GST fusion, dilution of the eluted proteins, and increased concentrations of bacterial contaminants. Prior to step 23, cool the SW 28 rotor and Beckmann ultracentrifuge to 4°C.",
    "22. Prepare an ∼5-ml glutathione Sepharose FF matrix in a chromatography column (XK16/20 or equivalent). Alternatively, a 5-ml glutathione cartridge can be used as the chromatography column. Connect the glutathione column to the chromatography system, wash out the preservatives with 0.22-µm filtered pure water, and equilibrate column with ∼50 ml of bacterial lysis buffer.\n23. Thaw the clarified lysate from step 20 (which is at −80°C) and transfer to two SW 28-tubes, adding 25-30 ml lysate to each. In order to remove any precipitates formed by the freeze-thaw cycle, centrifuge lysates in a pre-cooled SW 28 rotor and ultracentrifuge at 110,000 × g (25,000 rpm) and 4°C for 30 min.\nPrecipitates can also be removed by filtration using a 0.45-µm filter. However, we do not recommend this for the GST-LaG16-MNase protein given its tendency to form aggregates.\n24. Load the lysate with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min onto the 5-ml glutathione column. As the volume of the lysate is ∼50 ml, this loading step will take ∼100 min. Collect the flow-through of the column in 50-ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes.\nThe A260 reading should increase to >1 absorption units full scale (AUFS) after ∼10 ml and stay constant at this level during the loading.\n25. Transfer ∼100 µl lysate and ∼100 µl flow-through to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Store both tubes at −20°C for analysis by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels in step 45.\n26. Freeze the 50-ml tubes with the flow-through and store at −80°C.\n27. Change the loading tube of the chromatography system to glutathione wash buffer and wash the column with 30 ml of glutathione wash buffer I at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Collect the wash I in a 50-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube and keep on wet ice. This step will take ∼ 30 min.",
    "The A260 reading should drop to background levels after 10-20 ml of wash buffer.\n28. Transfer ∼100 µl of wash I to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Store this tube at −20°C for analysis by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels in step 45. Freeze the 50-ml tube with wash I and store at −80°C.\n29. Wash the column with 30 ml glutathione wash buffer II at 1 ml/min. Collect this wash II in 50-ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes. This step will take ∼30 min.\nThe A260 reading should stay at background levels.\n30. Transfer ∼100 µl wash II to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Store this tube at −20°C for analysis by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels at step 45. Freeze the 50-ml tube with wash II and store at −80°C.\n31. Prepare thrombin digestion solution by adding 350 µl of thrombin (500 U/ml) to 7 ml thrombin buffer. Take up this solution in a 10-ml syringe with a Luer lock. Make sure to remove any air bubbles from the solution in the syringe.\n32. Disconnect the glutathione column with the GST-fusion protein from the purification system. Make sure that no air gets trapped in the tubing or connectors. Attach the 10-ml syringe with the thrombin solution to the column outlet. Slowly inject the complete thrombin solution into the column and push out ∼2 ml of this buffer from the column inlet.\n33. Close the column inlet with a cap and keep the syringe connected to the column outlet. Keep the column overnight at room temperature to allow in-column digestion by thrombin.",
    "During this incubation, thrombin will cleave off the GFP nanobody-MNase fusion from the GST moiety, which remains bound to the glutathione matrix. An advantage of the in-column digestion strategy is direct removal of GST, while the disadvantages are that the thrombin cleavage is less efficient compared to an in-solution digestion and not as well-controlled compared to in-solution digestion.\n34. The next morning, fill a 10-ml syringe with a Luer lock with 10 ml fresh thrombin buffer (without the addition of thrombin enzyme). Remove cap from the inlet and connect this 10-ml syringe to the inlet.\n35. Slowly push the fresh thrombin buffer into the column. This will elute the released GFP nanobody-MNase from the column, which will be transferred into the syringe at the outlet. Continue until all fresh buffer passes through the column into the outlet syringe.\n36. Transfer the elution with the GFP nanobody-MNase from the 10-ml syringe into a 15-ml conical centrifuge tube. Add 50 µl of 200 mM PMSF to the elution to inactivate the thrombin. Mix by inverting and place on wet ice.\n37. Using a cut-off 200-µl pipet tip, transfer ∼100 µl benzamidine Sepharose matrix to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Add 1.2 ml pure water, invert three times, and spin at 600 × g for 1 min in a microcentrifuge. Remove supernatant without disturbing the benzamidine Sepharose matrix. Repeat this step.\nSteps 37-42 aim to selectively remove the inactivated thrombin from the solution by incubation with a benzamidine matrix, which has been equilibrated in thrombin buffer.\n38. Add 1.2 ml thrombin buffer (without thrombin enzyme) to the matrix, invert three times, and spin at 600 × g for 1 min in a microcentrifuge. Remove supernatant without disturbing the benzamidine Sepharose matrix. Repeat this step.",
    "39. Resuspend the benzamidine Sepharose matrix in ∼300 µl thrombin buffer. Using a cut-off 1,000-µl pipet tip, transfer the resuspended matrix to the elution fraction containing the GFP nanobody-MNase in the 15-ml conical tube.\n40. Place tube on a rotator and rotate at 12 rpm and 4°C for 2 hr.\n41. Spin tube for 5 min at 600 × g and 4°C in a pre-cooled centrifuge. Transfer supernatant to a 50-ml centrifuge tube on wet ice.\n42. Take up this GFP nanobody-MNase solution into a 15-ml syringe. Place a 0.22-µm filter on the syringe and slowly filter the solution into a 15-ml centrifuge tube on wet ice.\nThis filtration step removes the remainder of the benzamidine Sepharose matrix and prepares the solution for the cation exchange chromatography in step 46.\n43. Take a 100-µl aliquot into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Store tubes at −20°C for determination of protein concentration in step 44 and analysis by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels in step 45. Store the remainder in the 15-ml centrifuge tube at −80°C until further cation exchange purification.\n44. Determine protein concentration of the elution fraction with the GFP nanobody-MNase with the Bradford assay from Bio-Rad.\nThe expected concentration is between 0.5 and 2 mg/ml.\n45. Analyze the aliquots of the glutathione load (step 25), flow-through (step 25), wash I (step 28), wash II (step 30), and thrombin elution (step 43) by SDS-PAGE. Take 5 µl of the load, flow-through, and elution, and 10 µl of wash I and wash II, and add sample buffer to 20 µl. Incubate all samples for 5 min at 95°C before gel loading. Perform gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining as detailed in Current Protocols article: Gallagher, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-bib-0004].\nA clear band of ∼31 kDa should be present in the elution fraction.",
    "Purification over cation exchange column (time: 1 day)\n46. Take the GFP nanobody-MNase solution obtained in step 43 from the −80°C freezer and thaw on wet ice.\n47. Filter the solution using a 0.22-µm filter to remove any aggregates that may have formed by freeze-thawing. Keep the filtered GFP nanobody-MNase solution on wet ice.\n48. Equilibrate the 1-ml Mono S HR5/5 or HiTrap S HP column with 10 ml of 8% buffer B.\n49. Load the GFP nanobody-MNase solution onto the column with a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Take a 50-µl aliquot of the load into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Store tube at −20°C for analysis by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels in step 55.\n50. Collect the flow-through fraction in a 50-ml centrifuge tube and take a 100-µl aliquot into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Store tube at −20°C for analysis by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels in step 55. Freeze the 50-ml tube with flow-through and store at −80°C.\n51.

Collect 300 µl fractions of the 10-ml gradient (∼34 fractions in total) and store on ice.\nA clear A280 absorption peak should be apparent at ∼25% buffer B for the LaG16-MNase or at ∼35% buffer B for the enhancer-MNase protein.",
    "53. Wash column with 3 ml of 100% buffer B, collect this high-salt wash in a single fraction, and store on ice.\n54. Determine protein concentration of the elution fractions with the Bradford assay.\nThe expected concentration of the peak fraction is between 2.5 and 10 mg/ml.\n55. Analyze aliquots of the load, flow-through, wash, and elution fractions by SDS-PAGE. Take 5 µl of the load (step 49) and flow-through (step 50), 10 µl of the wash fraction (step 51), and 1 µl of the peak elution fractions (step 52) and add sample buffer to 20 µl. Incubate all samples for 5 min at 95°C before gel loading. Perform gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining as detailed in Current Protocols article: Gallagher, 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-bib-0004].\nA clear band of ∼31 kDa should be present in the elution fraction.\n56. Place a 15-ml centrifuge tube on wet ice to pre-cool. Combine peak fractions with the lowest relative amount of contaminating proteins into the pre-cooled 15-ml centrifuge tube. Dilute to 2 mg/ml with cold buffer A. Determine the exact volume and add an equivalent volume of 100% glycerol to reach a final concentration of 55% (v/v) glycerol and 1 mg/ml of purified GFP nanobody-MNase. Mix well by inverting until the solution is homogenous.\nThe elution fractions are in a mix of buffer A and buffer B, both of which contain 10% (v/v) glycerol. This means that adding one volume of pure glycerol at this step yields a solution with a final concentration of 55% (v/v) glycerol.\n57. Divide the 1 mg/ml GFP nanobody-MNase solution over pre-cooled 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes in 300 µl aliquots. Store at −80°C.\nThe preparations retain their activity upon storage at −80°C and repeated freeze-thawing for >2 years.\nMNase activity assay (time: 2 hr)",
    "The specific activity of the purified GFP nanobody-MNase protein is determined by comparison with MNase from a commercial source with a defined specific activity (e.g., New England Biolabs, cat. no. M0247S). This step consists of a short incubation with genomic DNA under digestion conditions. As MNase substrate, we use purified genomic DNA of high molecular weight from HeLa cells but DNA from other cell lines or tissues should also work. Parallel incubations lacking Ca++ ions are included to detect any contaminating DNase activities. We do not provide a detailed protocol for DNA analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis as this is a standard technique for a molecular biology lab. Interested readers can find details in Current Protocols article: Voytas, 2001[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-bib-0029].\n58. Use one aliquot of the purified GFP nanobody-MNase proteins to freshly prepare a five-point 1:3 dilution series in 1× MNase buffer. Select a range from 30 to 0.3 ng/µl (i.e., 30, 10, 3, 1, 0.3 ng/µl).\n59. Freshly prepare a five-point dilution series of commercial MNase in 1× MNase buffer in a range from 20 units/µl to 0.2 units/µl (i.e., 20, 6, 2, 0.6, 0.2 units/µl).\n60. Prepare a dilution of high MW DNA with a final concentration of 150 ng/µl in 1× MNase buffer. Add 8 µl of this solution to ten new tubes.\nFive of these will be used to test the GFP nanobody-MNAse series and five will be used to test the commercial MNase dilution series.\n61. Add 1 µl of 50 mM CaCl2 (freshly diluted from the 100 mM CaCl2 stock) to each of the ten tubes from step 60.\n62. Add 1 µl of each MNase dilution series sample (steps 58 and 59) per tube and incubate at 37°C for 15 min.",
    "63. Stop MNase digestion by adding 2 µl 0.5 M EDTA to each tube.\n64. Analyze 5 µl of each DNA digestion by a 1.2% agarose/TBE gel electrophoresis followed by staining with ethidium bromide.\n65. Compare the DNA digestion patterns of the purified GFP nanobody-MNase preparation with those of the commercial MNase (to determine the specific activity of the GFP nanobody-MNase preparation in comparison to the commercial MNase).\nA typical preparation has a specific activity of 200-600 units/µg (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.266#cpz1266-fig-0003]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c921ce99-e9fe-4751-8ab0-2a3364800096/cpz1266-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nEthidium bromide stained 1.2% agarose/TBE gel analyzing the activity of purified recombinant enhancer-MNase and LaG16-MNase proteins, and that of commercial MNase. The indicated amounts are in units for commercial MNase and in ng for the recombinant GFP nanobodies. The + sign denotes addition of CaCl2 to a final concentration of 5 mM. Increases in MNase result in increased DNA degradation as indicated by the conversion of high-molecular weight to lower molecular weight DNA as indicated by the DNA smears.
