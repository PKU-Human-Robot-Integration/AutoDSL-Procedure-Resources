    "1. Preparation of PMBPAz Solution (Figure 1)\nSynthesize MPC following a previously reported industrial procedure15.\nSynthesize the photoreactive MPC polymer PMBPAz using conventional radical polymerization of MPC, BMA, and MPAz in ethanol, as previously described14.\n\tNOTE: PMBPAz should contain 60%, 30%, and 10% (mol %) of the aforementioned monomer units, respectively. Refrigerate the PMBPAz dissolved in ethanol to prepare a 0.5 wt% solution before use.\nBefore treating the PMMA surface, allow the PMBPAz ethanol solution to stand for 30 min at room temperature.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54965/54965fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Chemical structural formula of the photoreactive MPC polymer PMBPAz. PMBPAz was constructed using an MPC unit, a BMA unit, and an MPAz unit.

PMBPAz Treatment of a Complete PMMA Denture (Figure 2)\nMechanically clean the denture for 3 min using a denture brush.\nChemically clean the denture for 5 min in an ultrasonic bath sonicator with a denture cleaner including 2.0% sodium hypochlorite and under the following sonication conditions: frequency, 50/60 Hz; phase number, 1φ; and oscillating frequency, 28 kHz.\nBefore performing the surface modification with PMBPAz, wash the denture surface by immersion in ethanol. After the ethanol wash, let the denture surface dry by itself, as ethanol is a volatile compound.\nApply 1 ml of PMBPAz ethanol solution directly to the entire surface of the denture using a brush applicator. Subsequently, keep the denture at room temperature and atmospheric pressure for 10 min to allow the solvent to evaporate in an ethanol vapor atmosphere. Allow it to dry. Repeat these steps twice.\nIrradiate the denture surface with UV light for 2 min (at 254 nm).\nImmerse the PMBPAz-treated denture in distilled water for 5 min before use.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54965/54965fig2.jpg",

Evaluation of Denture Plaque Deposition\nUse the PMBPAz-treated denture at home for 2 weeks. As a control, repeat the same procedure, excluding the treatment with the PMBPAz.\nAfter a patient has used the denture for 2 weeks (used about 12 to 14 hr per day), rinse it with tap water to remove any loose food particles, and then stain it with a 0.25% methylene blue disclosing solution for 1 min.\nClean any stains present on the denture surface in distilled water using an ultrasonic bath sonicator for 30 sec.\nCapture images at a 90° angle on a wax seat with a digital camera by using a white-light system. Capture images with the same focal object distance, exposure time, and intensity of illumination. Capture images from 3 different directions to get mucosal, right, and left polished surface images.\nCalculate the stained area and quantify it using an image analysis software for the entire denture surface16.\n\t\nSelect the denture area using the \"magnetic lasso\" tool from the captured denture image. Subsequently, change the red-colored channel to highlight the plaque area from the denture area image. Select all plaque areas using the \"magic wand\" tool (tolerance level 8) and the \"select similar\" tool from the denture area.\nCount the total number of pixels for each image. Thereafter, calculate the percentage plaque index of the area covered on the denture from the pixel count of these images (total plaque pixels/total denture surface pixels). Evaluate the statistical differences between the stained areas on the PMBPAz-treated and untreated dentures (ANOVA, p <0.05).",
