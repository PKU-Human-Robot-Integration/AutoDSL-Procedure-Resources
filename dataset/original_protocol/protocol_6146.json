    "Briefly, we inject NBD C6-Cer-RUB nanomicelles (Zhang et al., 2012; Hosain et al., 2016; Khiste et al., 2017) into tumor-bearing mice, and the live tissues of mice convert NBD C6-ceramide into NBD C6-glucosylceramide. Three hours after injection, we collect all tissues, including tumors, and then extract the lipids. Further, we apply HPLC to analyze NBD glucosylceramide and assess the in vivo GCS activities of tissues.Injection of NBD Cer-RUB into mice and in vivo glycosylationPrepare NBD Cer-RUB solution (NBD C6-Cer 0.25 mg/ml) in sterile condition (Recipe 1) and keep on ice (Figure 1A).Weigh body weight of each mouse on balance and calculate the injection volume of NBD C6 Cer-RUB solution, based on 1 mg/kg body weight for each mouse bearing OVCAR-3 tumor xenografts (Materials and Reagents #20). For instance, we inject 100 μl NBD C6 Cer-RUB solution containing 25 μg NBD C6-ceramide to a 25 g mouse.In animal operating hood, take NBD Cer-RUB solution into a U-100 insulin syringe, inject intraperitoneally into mice (Recipes 1, 5 cases/group) following wipe inject-site skin with 70% alcohol (Figure 1B).Keep injected mice in cages for 3 h, allowing uptake of NBD C6-ceramide and ceramide glycosylation in live animals. There are approximately 10 min intervals among the injections.Euthanize mouse with cervical dislocation and dissect tissues, including liver, lungs and tumors from three mice per group, according to the injection order.Rinse tissues with sterile PBS in 35-mm dishes twice and absorb with sterile paper towels.Dissect and put tissue of each mouse into microcentrifuge tubes, keep on ice or store at -80 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190616/20190616225106_9230.jpgFigure 1.

    "Tissue collection and extraction of lipids and proteinsDissect and weigh two of 50 mg pieces from the same tissue of all samples (liver, lung, tumor from five mice per group), and put in 2 microcentrifuge tubes containing 50 μl sterile PBS, respectively. Use one set of samples for lipid extraction and another one for protein extraction.Mince tissue with micro-scissor and sonicate it with an ultrasonic processor in PBS on ice.For lipid extraction:Add 100 μl water and transfer the tissue suspension into a 4-ml transparent glass vial for all samples.Add 0.85 ml of water, 1.0 ml methanol and 1.0 ml chloroform in the glass vial and vortex for 30 s to mix. Keep samples at room temperature for 20 min and vortex for 30 s after every 5 min. Centrifuge the glass vial tube at 4,500 x g, room temperature for 10 min, to separate the organic and aqueous phases.Gently hold glass vial and transfer of the organic phase (bottom layer) with Pasteur pipette into a new amber 4-ml glass vial (Figure 2, Video 1).Take 5 μl organic solution and add into a fluorescence 96-well plate with 145 μl methanol in duplicate. Measure fluorescence units in a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy HT, λ excitation 470 nm, λ emission 530 nm). The average fluorescence unites will be used to normalize all samples.Transfer 800 μl organic solution of each sample with glass pipette into an amber 4-ml glass vial, and dry with nitrogen gas completely (~20 min). Tightly close the vials and store all samples at -20 °C for further use.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190616/20190616225146_0257.jpgFigure 2.

    "This step needs to practice before experiments.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Transferring lipid extracts in the lower-phase with Pasteur pipette. Holding vials between left thumb and index fingers with ~65°, insert pipette tip into the bottom layer to the lowest corner of the sample vial. Slowly aspirate the lower-phase solution only (~900 µl) with pipette-aid, and then transfer it into the new glass vial.For protein extraction:Add 200 μl NP40 lysis buffer with ProteaseArrest (Recipe 3) and mix with tissue suspension (from Steps B1 and B2), and vortex for 30 s.Incubate the tubes on ice for 40 min, with vortex for 30 s per 5 min.Centrifuge samples at 9,400 x g, 4 °C for 10 min.Collect the supernatant of each sample in new microcentrifuge tubes, and store at -80 °C, except the portion for further protein measurement.Add 2 μl of protein extracts in triplicate and mix with 100 μl BCA reagents (50:1, Reagent A:B), into 96-well plates. Use bovine serum albumin (BSA, 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 μg) to generate the standard curve.Measure absorbance in a microplate reader (λ = 562 nm; BioTek Synergy HT) and obtain protein concentrations of samples (x μg/μl) with the BSA standard. The total protein amount: Pro = x × 160 (μg) for each sample (from 50 mg tissue used).HPLC Analysis of NBD C6-Glucosylceramide of mouse tissuesCharacterize and measure NBD C6-glucosylceramide with NBD C6-ceramide in standard solutions.Connect the Agilent 1220 Infinity LC system with column (ZORBAX Rx-SIL 5 μm, 4.6 x 250 mm, normal phase) and solvents, and equilibrate with Solvent A, at flow rate 1 ml/min for 60 min.Set up OpenLab CDS EZChrom program: flow rate 1 ml/min, injection volume 5 μl, linear gradient for 14 min (Solvent A 100%~0, and Solvent B 0~100%), and fluorescence detection (λ excitation 470 nm, λ emission 530 nm).",
    "Add 100 μl solutions of NBD C6-ceramide (Cer) and NBD C6-glucosylcerade (GlcCer) into the LVI vials, respectively. These solutions contain both Cer and GlcCer at increasing concentrations (0, 0.032, 0.063, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5 and 1 μM; see Recipe 5) (Figure 1A). Load the LVI vials in the carousel of HPLC system, run analysis triplicate and save the files.Characterize NBD glucosylceramide generated of samples.Add 100 μl of methanol/chloroform into in the amber glass vial of liver extracts to reconstitute lipids (Step B4f).Transfer 50 μl of reconstituted liver lipids (~2,000 fluorescence units) into the LVI vials.Add 2 μl NBD C6-glucosylceramide (0.125 μM) into the LVI vials and mix with liver lipids.Load in carousel of HPLC system and analyze three times.Measure NBD glucosylceramide and ceramide of samples.Add 100 μl of methanol/chloroform into amber glass vials to reconstitute the extracted lipids of samples.Transfer 50 μl of reconstituted samples (~2,000 fluorescence units) into the LVI vials and load in carousel of HPLC system.Set up OpenLab CDS EZChrom program: flow rate 1 ml/min, injection volume 5 μl, linear gradient for 14 min (Solvent A 100%-0, and Solvent B 0-100%), and fluorescence detection (λ excitation 470 nm, λ emission 530 nm).Run HPLC analysis triplicate and save the files."
