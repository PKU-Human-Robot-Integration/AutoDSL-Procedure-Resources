    "(Optional) Create pHluorin-expressing yeast strainTo integrate at the leu2 locus (S288C backgrounds), cut vector pCGT05 with PmeI by mixing the following reagents and incubating at 37 °C for 60 min.table:\n﻿0,1\nReagent (Concentration),Amount (μl)\npCGT05 (~200 ng/μl),5\nCutsmart Buffer (5x),5\n\"PmeI (10,000 units/ml)\",1\nUltrapure water,39",
    "Alternatively, a plasmid with a selectable marker may be used rather than integration; see Notes. Use this as a template in the transformation in Step A3 and plate on appropriate selection media.If the leu2 locus is not available in the desired strain, integration at another locus is also possible.(Optional) Check digestion efficacyTo check digestion, run 2-5 μl of product on a 1% agarose gel, along with uncut vector and a ladder. The cut product should run at two bands, one at 5.2 kb and the other at 3.5 kb; see Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200616/20200616103323_4370.jpgFigure 2. Vector pCGT05 before and after cutting with PmeI. The first lane is a ladder for size reference, the second lane is the vector without incubation with the restriction enzyme PmeI, the third lane is the vector after incubation with PmeI (there are two cut sites such that enzymatic digestion yields two fragments).Transform into desired strain of yeastTo integrate into the leu2 locus, follow a standard lithium acetate yeast transformation protocol (Gietz and Schiestl, 1994) using the product of the above digestion reaction as the DNA template.Screen colonies on SC plates without leucine (30 °C, allow 2-3 days for growth), and further colony purify on selection plates followed by non-selective plates to ensure that no wild-type cells remain.Cells in media may be mixed with glycerol to form a 20% final solution and stored at -80 °C for years.Grow cells (night before experiment)Inoculate starter cultures (at least 5 ml) of each strain of yeast you’d like to measure; include wild-type yeast not expressing pHluorin (for background subtraction) and a sufficient volume of pHluorin-expressing cells to both generate experimental samples and make a calibration curve to convert fluorescence to pH (see below for volume estimates).Aim for cells to be at around OD600 0.05-0.",
    "1 by the following morning (about 16 h later) so that they can either be analyzed right away, or mildly diluted in order to be analyzed later the same day.The calibration curve will require approximately 5 ml of pHluorin-expressing yeast at OD600 0.05-0.2.The target OD600 for experimental samples is 0.05 to 0.1, lower than what is typically used for microscopy or biochemistry-based experiments. Calibration curve samples can be slightly higher, up to OD600 0.2.Prepare 2x Calibration Curve Buffer. It can be prepared ahead of time and stored at 4 °C.Prepare calibration curve (morning of experiment)Add 5 ml of 2x Calibration curve buffer to eight 50 ml conical tubes. Add 3 ml of ultrapure water (or sufficient volume such that the electrode of the pH meter can be fully submerged in the liquid, keeping in mind that variable amounts of acid and base will need to be added to adjust the pH).Using concentrated HCl and KOH, adjust the pH of each tube to half pH units ranging from 5.0 to 8.5 (8 total; this spans the range of pH values to which the fluorophore is sensitive; measurement outside this range is not accurate). The initial pH should be in the range of 5.5-6.5.Note: Make sure that the buffer is at room temperature before adjusting pH, as the pH can be temperature-sensitive. Once the pH is in the correct range, add ultrapure water until the final volume is 10 ml (calibration curve buffer is now at 1x). Note the final pH and record the exact value on the outside of the tube.pH-adjusted 1x calibration curve buffer (without ionophore) can be stored at 4 °C for around a month. When re-using, bring to room temperature, re-measure the pH, and note any changes on the outside of the tube. Small changes (~0.",
    "05 pH units) are tolerable, but large changes indicate that the buffer should be discarded and re-made from the 2x stock.Prepare the calibration curve (~30 min before experiment)Aliquot 1 ml of calibration curve buffer at each pH into labeled 1.5 ml tubes and to each tube add 1 μl of 10 mM nigericin in 100% ethanol to a final concentration of 10 μM. This step should be done as close to the time of measurement as possible, as the ionophore degrades more rapidly at room temperature.Label additional 1.5 ml tubes for each pH that will be measured in the calibration curve (for cells), plus one additional tube for unlabeled cells.Once cells are between OD600 0.05 and 0.2, aliquot ~500 μl of pHluorin-expressing cells into each labeled tube. Aliquot one additional tube of unlabeled cells, which will be used for background subtraction.Spin cells at 3,000 x g for 3 min. Decant supernatant (media) with a pipette, being careful to remove as much of the liquid as possible without disturbing the cell pellet.Briefly wash cells by resuspending in 100 μl of deionized water and spinning at 3,000 x g for 3 min. Decant supernatant.Resuspend cells in 400 μl of the appropriate pH prepared calibration curve buffer with nigericin.If many cells were lost during decanting (for example if the pellet was disturbed by pipetting) or if the concentration is low to begin with, a smaller volume of buffer may be used, but at least 200 μl of volume is needed to make the measurement (this may vary with the model of cytometer used to make the measurements).The unlabeled cells may be resuspended in any pH, as the fluorescence background does not vary with the pH of the buffer.Allow cells to incubate in buffer for 15 min to equilibrate pH.",
    "After this, proceed to Procedure E as rapidly as possible. It may be possible to hold the cells in buffer for longer without loss of integrity or a change in the fluorescence values, but this should be tested empirically by running full curves multiple times at different time intervals.Analyze samples on the flow cytometerBriefly vortex tube or mix by inversion before loading each sample.Add 200 μl of wild type (non-pHluorin-expressing) cells, in media, into a 5 ml polystyrene flow tube. Place the tube on the flow cytometer and begin acquiring data. While running the sample on the lowest possible flow rate, isolate the events associated with cells by drawing a gate in the forward scatter vs. side scatter plot to collect the vast majority of cell events, see Figure 3 for typical scattering profile.Collect at least 10,000, but preferably 20,000+ events for each sample.Voltage settings for a BD LSR Fortessa instrument are given in Table 1. Other instruments and settings can be used; see Notes for more details.It is essential that the same voltages are used within the same experiment, and preferably should not be changed even between experiments. Data taken with different voltage settings cannot be directly compared.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200616/20200616103349_2811.jpgFigure 3.

All of these samples are essential for background subtraction.Using the same settings and volumes, run and collect data for all the samples in calibration curve buffer prepared in Procedure C.Run any additional experimental samples using the same settings.",
    "Note: In the case of experimental samples in different medium, a separate sample of unlabeled cells in the corresponding medium must also be analyzed in order to do proper background subtraction; see Data analysis section below.Export DataExport all data. The standard format for flow cytometry data is the .fcs format; data analysis below assumes data in this format."
