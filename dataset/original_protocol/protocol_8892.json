    "The protocol is based on a commercially available robot (see Materials table) and male moths (Agrotis ipsilon) with their sex pheromone. Yet, it can be adapted with minor modifications to other insect species, odorants, and robots.\n1. Insects\nRear larvae of Agrotis ipsilon Hufnagel (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) on an artificial diet and maintain them in individual plastic cups until pupation at 23±1 °C and 50±5% relative humidity as described previously24.\nSex pupae and keep adult males separately from females in plastic boxes. Give them free access to a 20% sucrose solution.\nPerform experiments with males. Male moths are highly sensitive to the sex pheromone emitted by their conspecific females. In A. ipsilon, the major pheromone component, cis-7-dodecenyl acetate (Z7-12:OAc) is the most active compound on the antenna.\n2. Electrophysiology\nRecord the EAG from a whole-insect preparation, as described below (Figure 1A). Intact antennae are preferred over excised antennae because they exhibit a longer lifetime (see representative results).\nChlorinate two silver wires by immersion in concentrated bleach solution for 10-20 min and rinse afterwards. This process prevents electrodes from polarizing. It has to be repeated whenever the baseline drifts during experiments or when the offset voltage between the electrodes becomes too large to be compensated by the amplifier.\nMake glass electrodes from fire polished capillaries with an electrode puller. Fire polishing prevents scratching the chlorinated silver wire with electrodes.\nAnesthetize a male moth with CO2 and place it inside a Styrofoam block with the head protruding from the top.\nTether the insect’s head with painter’s tape around the neck.\nInsert a silver wire serving as reference electrode into the neck.\nUnder a stereomicroscope, immobilize one of the antennae with thin strips of painter’s tape on the tip and the base.\nCut out the distal 2-3 segments of the antenna with surgical scissors.",
    "Position the glass electrode near the cut tip of the antenna with a micro-manipulator.\nCut out the extremity of the glass capillary with forceps to obtain a diameter slightly larger than the cut tip of the antenna.\nFill the glass pipette with (in mM) 6.4 KCl, 340 glucose, 10 Hepes, 12 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 12 NaCl, pH 6.5.\nInsert the cut tip of the antenna into the glass capillary with the micromanipulator.\nSlip the silver wire serving as the recording electrode into the largest extremity of the glass capillary.\n3. Hardware Interface\nMount the whole preparation, i.e. insect-electrodes-micromanipulator, on a metal plate screwed on the top of the robot (Figure 1B). Connect the electrodes to the robot, as described below.\nBased on previous works25-26, design a hardware interface to adapt the EAG output voltage (order 1 mV at several MΩ) to the range appropriate for the extension board of the robot. The board accepts 0-5 V analog inputs and a negative voltage below -200 mV may cause severe damage. Follow the steps 3.2.1 to 3.2.4 to design the interface with Eagle.\n\t\nDesign a ±5V power supply from a +12V battery using voltage regulator 78L10 (① in Figures 2A-2C).\nDesign a headstage preamplifier (10X) based on instrumentation amplifier INA121 (③ in Figures 2A-2C).\nDesign a second-stage amplifier (25X) with noise filtering (first order high-pass 0.1 Hz filter, second order low-pass 500 Hz filter, notch 50 Hz filter) based on quad op-amps LT1079 (④ in Figures 2A-2C).\nDesign a signal conditioning stage that computes with op-amp LT1079 and diode 1N4148 (⑤ in Figures 2A-2C). The total gain is 250 and the EAG output is in the range 0-5 V with zero being at 2.5 V.",
    "Connect the electrodes to the differential EAG inputs (② in Figures 2A-2C). Connect the recording electrode to the inverting input of the INA121 to obtain positive EAGs.\nConnect the EAG output (⑥ in Figures 2A-2C) to the 12 analog inputs of the extension board of the robot. As each input is read sequentially every millisecond, the sampling frequency is 1 KHz.\n4. Software Interface\nThe main threads contain a graphical user interface (GUI), methods for signal detection and various functions for controlling the robot.\nWrite a GUI (Figure 2D) in Qt-C++ for data visualization, digital filtering (20 Hz 5th order Butterworth low pass filter) and odor detection from the EAG. The latter can be performed in two ways: either by deconvolving the EAG with an appropriate filter (engineering approach, section 4.2), or by modeling the neural mechanisms that allow fast and reliable pheromone detection in A. ipsilon moths (bioinspired approach, section 4.3).\nDeconvolution filter. The EAG is well described by a nonlinear cascade27 that consists of a static nonlinearity imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq1.jpg and a 1st order low-pass filter with exponential impulse function imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq2.jpg for imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq3.jpg, see Figure 3A. In response to fluctuating odor concentration imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq4.jpg, the EAG output is given by the convolution integral imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq5.jpg. Deconvolution is simply obtained by the inverse of the system; that is imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq6.jpg in the frequency domain. Then, imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq7.jpg as the Fourier transform of the impulse response is imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq8.jpg. For signal detection, follow the steps 4.2.1 to 4.2.3.\n\t\nPerform the deconvolution process in the time domain as imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq9.jpg and imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq10.jpg, Figure 3B.\nApproximate the nonlinearity imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq11.jpg by a polynomial function. Fit the polynomial parameters and the time constant on input-output data pairs to minimize the mean square error between real imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq4.jpg and reconstructedimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq12.jpgodor concentration.\nDetect the pheromone hits whenever imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq12.jpg exceeds a predefined threshold.",
    "Neuromorphic detector. An alternative approach to detection consists in mimicking biology. In A. ipsilon moths, central neurons receiving input from the antenna respond to the pheromone with a stereotypical firing pattern of excitation-inhibition13. A Hodgkin–Huxley type neuron model with four ionic currents imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq13.jpg (a delayed rectifier K+ current, voltage-gated Na+ and Ca2+ currents, a small conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ current) was previously developed to reproduce the observed physiological responses13. For signal detection, follow the steps 4.3.1 to 4.3.3.\n\t\nImplement the neuron model as differential equations. Use the EAG signal as input current imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq14.jpg in the evolution of the membrane potential imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq15.jpg. Use a membrane capacitance C = 22.9 pF and a leak current given by imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq16.jpg with conductance gL = 0.011161 µS and reversal potential EL = -61.4 mV. The ionic currents are described by imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq17.jpg with imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq18.jpgby where imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq19.jpg are nonlinear functions of V. See previous work13 for the details.\nSimulate the neuron model in real time with Sirene by integrating the differential equations with a 4th order Runge-Kutta method and a time step imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq20.jpg = 0.01 msec. Run the spike test V(tf) >0 mV and V(tf - imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51704/51704eq20.jpg) <0 mV online to obtain spike times and interspike intervals.\nDetect the pheromone hits whenever a burst of excitation (3 consecutive interspike intervals <70 msec) is followed by inhibition (interspike interval ≥350 msec), see Figure 3C."
