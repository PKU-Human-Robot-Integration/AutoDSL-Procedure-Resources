    "Generating the desired strains expressing Pscm::gfp using JR672 (Figure 4)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181227/20181227233418_1838.jpgFigure 4. Schematic diagrams of genetic crosses for Pscm::gfp expressing mutants. JR672 is crossed with wild-type males to get the GFP-expressing heterozygote males, which are mated with mutants of interests on Day 4. Then, the GFP-expressing hermaphrodites in the F2 generation are the double heterozygotes. With the Mendelian Segregation, the double heterozygotes from the F2 generation would give rise to double homozygotes with a 1/16 chance, when two mutations are not linked. However, since we select only the GFP-expressing worms, the chance for the double homozygotes is increased to 1/12. The green boxes in F3 indicate the possible genotypes of GFP-expressing worms and the red box indicates the genotype of the double mutant.Prepare NGM plates for the crosses by seeding 20 μl of OP50 in the middle of 60 mm plates. By making a small bacterial lawn, the chances of worm mating are increased.Cross hermaphrodite of the strain JR672 with N2 males. Hermaphrodite to male ratio for the crosses is usually 1:3. On Day 3, remove the parent worms to avoid mixing of two generations.On Day 4, select F1 males, which are GFP-positive heterozygote to set up a cross with hermaphrodites of your mutant of interest. Keep the hermaphrodite to male ratio 1:3.On Day 6, remove the parent worms from the plate. Now, it is expected to have only the F2 generation as larvae or eggs in the plate.On Day 7, select the hermaphrodites that express GFP in the hypodermal seam cells. There is a 50% chance to get the GFP-expressing hermaphrodites if the mating is successful. Clone out a couple of GFP-expressing hermaphrodites, one animal per seeded plate.On Day 9, remove the parent worm from the plate.On Day 10, chose one plate which has a good number of worms.",
    "Discard the rest of the plates. From the chosen plate, single out GFP-expressing worms. The chance to get the double mutant is one out of twelve if the mutation is not in the same linkage group as the GFP locus, because only the GFP-expressing worms are selected for analysis. Based on the chance to getting double mutants, select the appropriate number of F3 worms. To increase probability of getting double mutants, pick three to four times number of worms. We usually select forty worms if the mutation of interest is not linked with Pscm::gfp. Note that Pscm::gfp is located on linkage group V.On Day 12, genotype F3 worms for the mutation of interest and select the plates which have homozygotes. Check the plates that have homozygous mutants and identify the ones with all F4 animals positive for GFP expression. If desired, GFP homozygotes can be selected by PCR in F3 generation.Synchronizing and preparing the worms for microscopyTo obtain a synchronized population of animals, allow ten to twenty of fertile adult worms to lay eggs for two hours and let them grow until they reach the L4 stages at 20 °C as described in Part I Procedure A.Prepare the 2% agarose pads on the imaging slide as described before (Huynh et al., 2018).Place ten L4 worms in 7 μl of 10 mM levamisole on the 2% agarose pad, put a coverslip and stabilize the coverslip by painting four corners of coverslip with transparent nail polish.Under the 40x objective lens, check the GFP signals. GFP is expressed in the nuclei of hypodermal seam cells. Wild-type worms have sixteen hypodermal seam cells on each side at L4 stage (Figure 5), thus the total number of hypodermal seam cells per worm is 32.",
    "By focusing up and down, count the number of hypodermal seam cells on each side. In the tail, the focal planes of right and left hypodermal seam cells are closer than others. Thus it is easier to count the total number of hypodermal seam cells by counting one side of cells from the head to tail and the other side from tail to head.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181227/20181227233449_1226.jpgFigure 5. GFP-expression pattern of Pscm::gfp in wild-type C. elegans. A. GFP is expressed in the nuclei of hypodermal seam cells. A 40x objective lens was used in this image. B. Sixteen hypodermal seam cells are shown in wild-type C. elegans under the 10x objective lens. The smear GFP signal is from the other side of hypodermal seam cells (Zhang et al., 2018)."
