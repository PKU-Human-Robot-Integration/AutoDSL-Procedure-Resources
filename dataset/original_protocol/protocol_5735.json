    "Figures 1 and 2 show the whole procedures of this protocol. In this protocol, FA method is used for virus titration.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180503/20180503015753_2345.jpgFigure 1. Time-of-addition experiment. Pretreatment: Cells (1) or virus (2) are treated with an antiviral substance before virus inoculation to the cells. Co-treatment: Virus mixed with an antiviral substance (3) is inoculated to the cells. Post-entry treatment: Virus-infected cells (4) are treated with an antiviral substance. A representative result of a time-of-addition experiment is shown in Figure 3.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180503/20180503015835_0119.jpgFigure 2. Temperature-shift assay to differentiate viral attachment and penetration. Blockade of attachment: Cells and viral inoculum are treated with an antiviral substance at 4 °C (5). Blockade of penetration: Cells inoculated with virus at 4 °C are treated with an antiviral substance at 37 °C (6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180503/20180503015928_8612.jpgFigure 3. A representative result of a time-of-addition experiment. Pretreatment of cells: Cells are treated with serial dilutions of an antiviral substance before virus inoculation to the cells. Co-treatment: Virus and cells are treated with serial dilutions of an antiviral substance. Post-entry treatment: Virus-infected cells are treated with serial dilutions of an antiviral substance. (-): mock-treated control. The result shows a dose-dependent inhibition of viral infection under the co-treatment condition, but not under the pretreatment of cells or post-entry treatment conditions.Pretreatment of cells before virus infection (see Figure 1)Day 1 Place a glass coverslip into each well of a 24-well plate and seed Huh7it-1 cells (2 x 105 cells) to each well (500 μl/well).Incubate the cells at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator overnight. Note: The cells become 80-90% confluent after overnight culture. Day 2 Remove culture medium from each well.Add 200 μl of culture medium containing serial dilutions of an antiviral substance (e.g., 1,000, 100, 10 and 1 ng/ml). Incubate for 1 h to 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.",
    "To prepare virus solution, dilute the virus stock in an appropriate volume of culture medium (e.g., 2,000 focus-forming unit [FFU] in 200 μl) in a 1.5 ml tube and vortex gently.Remove the medium containing the antiviral substance and rinse the cells twice with culture medium. Inoculate virus onto drug-pretreated cells (multiplicity of infection [MOI] = 0.01 to 0.1 FFU/cell) (200 μl/well).Note: Virus is inoculated to cells in the absence of the antiviral substance.Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.Remove the inoculum and rinse the cells three times with culture medium.Add culture medium (500 μl/well) without the antiviral substance.Incubate for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.Day 3 Remove culture medium from each well and rinse the cells twice with PBS(-).To fix infected cells, carefully add 4% paraformaldehyde to a coverslip into each well (200 μl/well) and leave for 20 min. Note: More detailed instruction of cell fixation has been described in Bio-protocol “Immunofluorescent staining of mouse intestinal stem cells” (O’Rourke et al., 2016). After washing the cells three times with PBS(-) (200 μl/well), add 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS(-) (200 μl/well) to permeabilize cells for 15 min at room temperature.Wash the cells three times with PBS(-) (200 μl/well).Incubate the cells with 1% BSA in PBS(-) (200 μl/well) for 1 h to avoid nonspecific FA staining.Incubate the cells with an appropriate concentration of antiviral antibody (primary antibody) in PBS(-) (200 μl/well) for 1 h at room temperature.Note: As primary antibody, we used rabbit anti-DENV PrM (1:500 dilution), mouse anti-DENV (1:500 dilution), anti-HCV human serum (1:500 dilution), rabbit anti-CV-B3 (1:100 dilution), rabbit anti-FLUAV (1:1,000 dilution), rabbit anti-SeV (1:1,000 dilution) and rabbit anti-HSV-1 (1:1,000 dilution). Wash the cells three times with PBS(-) (200 μl/well) to remove the unbound antibody.",
    "Incubate the cells with FITC or Alexa488-conjugated secondary antibody (1:800 dilution, 200 μl/well) against IgG of appropriate origin (human, mouse, rabbit, etc.) for 1 h at room temperature. Wash the cells three times with PBS(-) (200 μl/well) to remove the unbound antibody.Counterstain the cells with Hoechst 33342 diluted with PBS(-) (1:1,000 dilution) for 5 min and rinse three times with PBS(-) (200 μl/well).Put a small amount of Vectashield solution on a slide glass. Hold a coverslip with tweezers and touch the edge to a paper towel to remove excess PBS(-). Turn the coverslip upside-down and sandwich the coverslip and slide glass together, avoiding bubbles. After air-drying at room temperature in the dark, observe under a fluorescence microscope.Note: Infectivity of vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSNJV), Sindbis virus (SINV) and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) can be determined by plaque assay and/or 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) assay, as described elsewhere. Also, amounts of viral proteins and viral nucleic acids (DNA and/or RNA) in the infected cells can be determined by Western blotting and quantitative PCR (qPCR and qRT-PCR) analyses, respectively.Pretreatment of virus before inoculation to the cells (see Figure 1) Day 1See Day 1 of Procedure A.Day 2 Prepare serial dilutions of an antiviral substance (2,000, 200, 20 and 2 ng/ml) in culture medium in a 1.5 ml tube.To prepare virus solution, dilute the virus stock in an appropriate volume of culture medium (2,000 FFU in 100 μl) in a 1.5 ml tube and vortex gently.Add 100 μl of an antiviral substance solution and 100 μl of virus in a 1.5 ml tube.
