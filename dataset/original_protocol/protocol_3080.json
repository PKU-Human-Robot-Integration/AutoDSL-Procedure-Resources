    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nFluorescence Imaging of In Vitro Reconstituted Microtubules by TIRFM\nTiming: 45 min to 1 h for preparation, 1 h to 1 day for imaging\nIn this assay, microtubules are visualized by the addition and incorporation of fluorescently labeled tubulin. TIRF microscopy uses a collimated laser aimed at the sample at a low angle of incidence such that the difference in refractive indices of the objective oil and aqueous sample causes the laser to reflect back entirely. A resulting evanescent wave illuminates a region extending approximately 100 nm into the sample, thereby restricting the excitation and detection of fluorophores to a thin region.\nFlow 20 μL of 100 μg/mL neutravidin (or anti-rhodamine antibodies for rhodamine-labeled seeds) in 1× BRB80 into the flow chamber. Neutravidin binds biotinylated tubulin thereby attaching the seeds tightly to the glass surface (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nNote: Adequately prepared silanized glass will be hydrophobic, preventing the initial volume of liquid from entering the chamber by capillary action. Use a vacuum at low power to draw the neutravidin solution through the chamber. Once the chamber is full, all subsequent washes can be drawn through by touching absorbent paper to one end and pipetting from the other side. Take care to avoid spillage, especially onto the surface that will face the microscope objective.\nCritical: Avoid introducing air bubbles to the flow chamber. Air bubbles will disrupt the flow of liquid through the chamber and cause oxidation.\nIncubate for 5 min.\nNote: To avoid the reaction channel from drying out, we place the flow chamber inside a humidified container with a lid (e.g., a petri dish equipped with wet tissue) and add droplets of the reaction mix at the two ends of the flow chamber.\nWash out neutravidin with 2 x 20 μL of 1× BRB80.",
    "Flow 2 x 20 μL 1% Pluronic F-127 in 1× BRB80 through the chamber and incubate for 15 up to 45 min to block unspecific binding.\nNote: To avoid contamination, we use small aliquots of filtered 1% Pluronic-F127 in 1× BRB80, which we store at −20°C.\nWash the chamber with 2 x 20 μL of wash buffer composed of 1× BRB80 supplemented with 1 mg/mL κ-casein.\nNote: From this point, all solutions should contain κ-casein to enhance blocking of the coverslip surface and reduce non-specific protein-protein interactions.\nFlow in 20 μL of thawed GMPCPP-seeds diluted in wash buffer into the chamber and incubate for 5 min.\nNote: At this point you can check the density of your seeds on the microscope.\nRemove unbound seeds with 2 x 20 μL wash buffer.\nPrepare the polymerization reaction by mixing GTP (final concentration 2 mM), β mercaptoethanol (final concentration 1% v/v), κ-Casein (final concentration 1 mg/mL), PCA (final concentration 2.5 mM), PCD (final concentration 25 nM), methylcellulose (final concentration 0.15% w/v), Trolox (final concentration 2 mM), labeled and/or unlabeled tubulin in 1× BRB80.\nNote: It is advisable to prepare a 2× polymerization mix without the tubulins for multiple reactions. It can be kept on ice for a maximum of 2 h. Tubulin should be kept on dry ice or in liquid nitrogen and thawed only prior to addition to the reaction mixture. The final concentration of tubulin will depend on your source of tubulin, 10 μM final concentration is a good starting point.",
    "Note: κ-Casein further passivates the glass surface. PCA/PCD (protocatechuic acid/protocatechuate-3,4-dioxygenase) is an enzymatic oxygen scavenging system for improved fluorescent dye stability. Trolox reduces photobleaching. Methylcellulose is a crowding agent that reduces thermal fluctuations of long microtubules. Importantly, concentrations below 0.5% methylcellulose have been shown to have no effect on microtubule growth and shortening velocities (Dixit and Ross 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nFlow the reaction mixture through the chamber and seal the chamber openings with an inert sealant such as silicone vacuum grease.\nMount sample onto the microscope and start imaging:\nAdjust the TIRF angle to an angle that eliminates as much background signal from the soluble labeled tubulin as possible and thereby allows microtubules to become visible.\nKeep laser power and exposure time to a minimum to avoid photobleaching. For the above setup, for example, excitation at 488 nm of a sample containing Atto488-labled tubulin with a laser power of 0.54 mW and an exposure time of 200 ms produces a signal that falls within the lowest 6% of the dynamic range of the detection system. While noisy, this is sufficient for visualizing microtubules.\nLabel-free Imaging of In Vitro Reconstituted Microtubules by IRM\nTiming: 1.5 h for preparation, 1 h to 1 day for imaging\nIRM is based on the interference of light reflected from closely adjacent surfaces or a surface and a subdiffraction-limited object of interest such as a microtubule.\nFlow in 20 μL anti-rhodamine antibody (20–200 μg/mL in 1× PBS) to immobilize rhodamine-labeled seeds (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C) or flow in neutravidin to immobilize biotinylated seeds.\nIncubate 15 min at room temperature.",
    "Note: To avoid the reaction channel from drying out, we place the flow chamber inside a humidified container with a lid (e.g., a petri dish equipped with wet tissue) and add droplets of the reaction mix at the two ends of the flow chamber.\nWash the flow cell three times with 20 μL 1× BRB80.\nFlow in 20 μL of 1% Pluronic-F127 in 1× BRB80 of and incubate for 20 min.\nNote: To avoid contamination, we use small aliquots of filtered 1% Pluronic-F127 in 1× BRB80, which we store at −20°C.\nWash five times with 20 μL 1× BRB80.\nNote: Use 1× BRB80 that is warmed at least to room temperature in order to bring the flow chamber to a moderate temperature for the following injection of GMPCPP-stabilized microtubule seeds.\nFlow 10–15 μL of diluted GMPCPP-stabilized seeds into the flow chamber using a cut-off 20 μL pipette tip and incubate for 7–10 min at room temperature.\nNote: We recommend diluting 5 μL GMPCPP-stabilized microtubules in 30 μL in 1× BRB80 that is prewarmed to 37°C.\nNote: At this point, evaluate at the microscope if the required number of microtubule seeds is immobilized on the glass surface, whether seeds are properly attached, and whether the remaining surface is sufficiently clean (in IRM all contaminants provide contrast).\nWash with 60 μL 1× BRB80 that is prewarmed to 37°C.\nPrepare the polymerization reaction by mixing D-glucose (final concentration 40 mM), glucose oxidase (final concentration 250 nM), catalase (final concentration 65 nM), β-Mercaptoethanol (final concentration 1%), κ-Casein (final concentration 0.1 mg/mL), methylcellulose (final concentration 0.1%) in 1× BRB80.",
    "Note: Instead of using glucose/catalase/oxidase as oxygen scavenger system one can also use Trolox/PCA/PCD. We here describe two of the most common oxygen scavenger systems (1) Trolox/PCA/PCD and (2) Glucose/catalase/oxidase. To increase fluorophore lifetime and protect fluorophores from photophysical bleaching, enzymes - so-called oxygen scavengers - are used. By oxidizing a substrate, they create anaerobic conditions and prevent oxygen-based reactions. Trolox/PCA/PCD can be used for both TIRFM and IRM, but is better suited for assays that use fluorescence, because in addition to the oxygen scavenging activity of PCA/PCD, Trolox also acts as a triplet-state quencher. Glucose/catalase/oxidase can and has historically been used for both, but has the disadvantage of causing a larger drop in pH over time (Selvin and Ha, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]).\nNote: Prepare a final volume of 150–300 μL for one experiment and keep it on ice.\nNote: We recommend storing the individual components as stock solutions in small aliquots at 50× or 100× concentration at −20°C. Casein is always centrifuged for 2 min at 13,000 × g before being added to the polymerization reaction, to avoid potential protein clusters being introduced.\nSupplement the polymerization reaction with fresh GTP.\nNote: To induce robust polymerization for a standard microtubule dynamic assay, use a final GTP concentration of 1 mM. The GTP concentration can be adjusted depending on the experimental needs. We usually transport GTP frozen on dry ice to the microscope and add it to the polymerization reaction only directly before starting the experiment at the microscope.\nWash the channel with 20 μL polymerization reaction supplemented with GTP.\nNote: This wash is important to equilibrate the flow chamber prior to the experiment with polymerization reaction mix and more importantly with the wanted GTP concentration.\nThaw label-free tubulin quickly and put it on ice.",
    "Spin down the label-free tubulin at 4°C and 13,000 × g for 5 min.\nDilute the label-free tubulin to the desired concentration with polymerization reaction mix complemented with GTP.\nNote: Prepare this solution always freshly and directly prior to the experiment. For a standard microtubule dynamic assay using porcine tubulin, a final tubulin concentration of 10 μM is sufficient to induce microtubule growth at the ends of the microtubule seeds.\nFlow the label-free tubulin into the flow cell.\nStart imaging:\nWarm the objective to 34°C before starting the experiment and keep the temperature stable with the implemented temperature control during the experiment.\nNote: If possible, equilibrate the temperature of the objective and setup overnight. In this manner, drift is minimized. Also, switch on any other heat source overnight to prewarm and equilibrate the whole optical setup and room to a stable temperature. On setups with millikelvin-precision temperature control (Simmert et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]), even the influence of heat from the LED light source can be measured. If necessary, adjust the aperture and field iris for best contrast as pointed out in The Microcopes subsection in Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].\nFor imaging, use as much LED power as possible without saturating the camera, we usually use 4% LED power.\nFor imaging, we usually average 10 frames in real-time during image acquisition. The resulting final imaging speed of the recorded video with frame averaging is 370 ms/frame. We use 90% of the total dynamic range of greyscale levels to enhance the contrast of the sample.\nTo achieve maximal contrast for the microtubules, adjust the focus.\nFor a low-noise background image, move the stage laterally sufficiently fast and record and median average 400 images acquired at a frame rate of 25 Hz (Simmert et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]). Images can be recorded while the stage is moving.",
    "Subtract the background image from any recorded image in real-time (see note below).\nRecord videos of microtubule dynamics.\nNote: The choice of imaging conditions will of course depend on your tubulin source, experimental question, and features of the IRM used. Our custom-written image acquisition software subtracts the background and averages frames in real-time. If background subtraction and image processing cannot be performed in real-time, they can also be done after acquisition of the raw images."
