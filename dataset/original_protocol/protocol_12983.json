    "All animal experiments described were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Cincinnati Children's Medical Center and were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines. Ad libitum access to standard rodent chow and water was provided at all times to mice, including during the CGS paradigm. Mice were housed on a 14 h/10 h light-dark cycle (lights on 06:00 h) unless otherwise specified (i.e., exposure to lights overnight).\n1. Preparing for timed matings\nAt least 2 weeks prior to setting up timed matings, house the adult female mice together in a standard mouse cage (18.4 cm x 29.2 cm x 12.7 cm), four mice per cage. Label each female mouse with a specific ID number via an ear tag.\n\tNOTE: C57BL6 female mice with no prior pregnancy and between 3 to 6 months of age were used for this protocol.\nAt least 1 week prior to setting up timed matings, individually house the adult male mice to be used for mating.\n2. Setting up timed matings\nSet up the timed matings at 18:00 h. Take two female mice and place them inside a cage that holds an individually housed male mouse. Separate the timed matings the following morning by 08:00 h.\n3. Checking the copulatory plug, designated as gestational day 0.5 (G0.5)\nImmediately after separating timed matings, check for the presence of a copulatory plug in the female mice. The presence of a copulatory plug will mark G0.5. Allow the mouse to hold the wire grid inside the cage and gently lift it by the tail to visualize the vaginal opening.",
    "NOTE: The presence of a copulatory plug indicates sexual activity has occurred but does not guarantee a pregnancy. When attempting to calculate the number of experimental mice needed, expect 50% of mice to be plugged from timed matings and a pregnancy to plug incidence of 60%-70%.\nUse simple visual examination to identify the presence of a copulatory plug (an opaque whitish hardened mass within or slightly protruding from the vaginal opening). If the copulatory plug is not easily identified by simple visual examination, gently insert a blunt end probe into the vaginal opening. Identify the plugs located further back in the vagina by the resistance of probe insertion.\nSeparate the female mice with copulatory plugs and group house in standard mouse cages, 3 to 4 mice per cage.\n4. Preparing for CGS paradigm\nRandomly assign cages housing female mice with copulatory plugs into two groups on G5.5: Control and CGS group. Attempt to randomize cages to have an approximately equal number of mice per group. Transfer the mice to clean standard mouse cages and label with a \"do not disturb\" sign. Designate these cages as \"home cages\" for mice to place them at the end of each stressor.\nDesignate a separate room in the mouse facility to perform the CGS paradigm. Design a 11-day stressor regimen, which runs from G6.5 to G17.5, to utilize each of the 7 day stressors [exposure to foreign objects (marbles or legos), predator odor exposure (dirty rat bedding), 30° cage tilt, frequent changes of bedding, bedding removal, movement on shaker] twice per day, and to utilize each of the 3 night stressors (overnight lights on, cage mate change, exposure to wet bedding) overnight in a random fashion. For a possible sample schedule and schematic of experiments described below, see Figure 1.",
    "NOTE: Each day stressor should fall within the light cycle of mice (lights on 06:00 h-20:00 h), and last 2 h, with at least a 2 h break in between stressors. Each night stressor should be set up at the beginning of the dark cycle (lights off 20:00 h) and separated at the start of light cycle (lights on 06:00 h).\n5. Performing the CGS paradigm\nSet up specific stressors on a standard static cage with filtered top and water bottle in the room designated for the CGS paradigm. Prepare the number of static cages needed for the experiment depending on the number of mouse cages designated to undergo CGS during randomization. Before starting each stressor, transfer the mouse cages of the CGS group from the housing room to the CGS room.\n\tNOTE: Perform the handling/transfer of mice from home cage to experimental cage and back in laminar flow hoods.\nApply the following stressors according to the pre-designed regimen (refer to step 4.2).\n\t\nExposure to foreign objects (marbles or legos): Place six marbles (14 mm in diameter) or six legos (different shapes, not to exceed 4 cm in height) randomly distributed into a clean static cage with mouse bedding, without including the mouse nestlets. Place the mice together with their home cage counterparts into the static cage with foreign objects for 2 h. Return the mice to their home cage with the same counterparts at the conclusion of the stressor.\n\t\tNOTE: Clean the foreign objects after use.",
    "Predator odor exposure (dirty rat bedding): Place 1 cm in depth of fresh dirty rat bedding from female rats into a clean static cage with no mouse bedding, without including the mouse nestlets. Place the mice together with their home cage counterparts into the static cage with dirty rat bedding for 2 h. Return the mice to their home cage with the same counterparts at the conclusion of the stressor.\n30° cage tilt: Place the mice with their home cage counterparts into a clean static cage with mouse bedding, without including the mouse nestlets. Tilt the cage at 30° against the wall for 2 h. Return the mice to their home cage with the same counterparts at the conclusion of the stressor.\nFrequent changes of bedding: Place the mice with their home cage counterparts into a clean static cage with mouse bedding, without including the mouse nestlets. Substitute the mouse bedding with clean mouse bedding every 10 min for 2 h. During mouse bedding changes, gently place the mice in a different clean cage to avoid direct contact with the mice. Return the mice to their home cage with the same counterparts at the conclusion of the stressor.\nBedding removal: Place the mice together with their home cage counterparts into an empty clean static cage (with no mouse bedding or nestlets) for 2 h. Return the mice to their home cage with the same counterparts at the conclusion of the stressor.\nMovement on shaker: Place the mice with their home cage counterparts into a clean static cage with mouse bedding, without including the mouse nestlets. Place the static cage atop a reciprocal lab shaker set to 140 strokes per min for 2 h. Return the mice to their home cage with the same counterparts at the conclusion of the stressor.",
    "Overnight exposure to lights: Place the mice with their home cage counterparts into a clean static cage with mouse bedding, without including the mouse nestlets. Keep the lights on overnight (20:00 h-06:00 h) to interfere with dark cycle. Return the mice to their home cage with the same counterparts at the conclusion of the stressor.\nCage mate change: Transfer the mouse into a clean static cage with mouse bedding which is being housed by a different group of two female mice (intact females not part of treatment or control group). Keep the mouse in the static cage with unfamiliar cage mates overnight. Return the mouse to its home cage with its specific home cage counterparts at the conclusion of the stressor.\nExposure to wet bedding: Fill the static cage with mouse bedding with clean water kept at 24 °C until bedding is saturated with water. Place the mice together with their home cage counterparts into the static cage with wet bedding overnight. Return the mice to their home cage with the same counterparts at the conclusion of the stressor.\nDuring CGS paradigm, keep the control mice undisturbed in their home cages inside the housing room.\nReplace the used home cages with new home cages on G10.5. On G17.5, at the conclusion of the overnight stressor, single-house all the experimental mice to prepare for parturition and downstream functional assessments.\n6. Monitoring the experimental mice during the CGS paradigm\nMonitor the mice every 1 h during stressor application, except during overnight stressors.\nExclude the mice displaying distress signs, including wounds, lethargy, or any physical abnormality from the experiment. Contact the veterinary staff as needed.\n7. Measuring the percentage body weight gain during gestation in the experimental mice (optional)",
    "On G6.5, weigh the mice individually before the exposure to stressors. On G17.5, at the conclusion of the overnight stressor, weigh the mice individually. Weigh the control mice at the equivalent gestational time points.\nMeasure the percentage body weight gain during gestation by setting the weight of the first day of the CGS paradigm (G6.5) as 100%.\n8. Measuring the postpartum relative adrenal gland weights in experimental mice (optional)\nOn postpartum day 2 (PP2), weigh the control and the CGS dams individually. Euthanize the dams by carbon dioxide inhalation followed by cervical dislocation in a fume hood.\nPlace the mice on a dissection plate, sterilize the abdominal area with 70% ethanol, and open the abdominal cavity using scissors to make a vertical cut. Isolate the adrenal glands located adjacent to the anterior pole of the kidneys with forceps, bilaterally. Carefully dissect the fat tissue surrounding the adrenal glands underneath a dissecting microscope.\nWeigh the bilateral adrenal glands individually. Calculate the relative adrenal gland weights in milligrams per gram (total weight of the right and the left adrenal glands/body weight).\n9. Measuring the postpartum hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis activity in the experimental mice (optional)\nIn preparation for HPA axis measurements, euthanize litters to 6 pups per litter on postpartum day 0 (PP0). Use carbon dioxide inhalation, followed by decapitation with surgical scissors as a secondary method of euthanasia.\nOn postpartum day 2 (PP2), individually restrain the control and the CGS dams inside a well-ventilated 50 mL polypropylene conical tube for 20 min. Immediately after restraint stress, remove the mouse from the conical tube and restrain the mouse with the non-dominant hand by holding the loose skin over the shoulders and posterior to the ears to have the skin over the mandible taut.",
    "Puncture the submandibular vein with a lancet slightly behind the mandible but anterior to the ear canal. Collect up to 100 µL of maternal blood in a serum separator tube. After sample collection, apply gentle pressure with gauze to the puncture site to stop the bleeding. Return the dams to the home cage once the bleeding stops.\nCentrifuge the serum separator tube at 21,130 x g for 6 min and carefully remove the serum. Store the serum at -20 °C for later use. Measure the serum corticosterone concentration by an ELISA kit following the manufacturer's protocol.\n10. Measuring the postpartum behavioral changes in the experimental mice (optional)\nTo prepare for the behavioral analysis, cull litters to 6 pups per litter on PP0.\nPerform analysis of the maternal care fragmentation from PP2 to PP5. On each day, during the light cycle, expose the dams to the testing room for a 5 min habituation period before videotaping the maternal behavior for a 30 min period.\n\t\nAssess the maternal care fragmentation by measuring the average length of an individual licking/grooming bout and the total number of bouts performed by dams19.\n\t\tNOTE: Licking/grooming behavior is defined as a behavior where the dam is making contact with the pup's body with her tongue, or the pup is being handled by the dam with her forepaws. A bout is defined as an uninterrupted period of time where the dam is engaged in licking/grooming of her pups.",
    "Perform analysis of anhedonia via sucrose preference test (SPT) from PP0 to PP6. Expose the dams to one 100 mL bottle of clean water and one 100 mL bottle of 4% sucrose solution in their home cage. Measure the amount of water and sucrose consumed (in mL) daily. Interchange the bottle placement in the home cage. Calculate the sucrose preference using the averages from the last 4 days: preference % = [(sucrose consumption / sucrose + water consumption) x 100].\nPerform analysis of anxiety-like behavior via elevated zero maze (EZM) on PP8. Place the dams individually on the EZM apparatus consisting of two closed quadrants and two open quadrants elevated from the floor. Allow the dams to explore the maze undisturbed for 5 min. Quantify the time spent in the open quadrant and the number of entries into the open quadrants.\n11. Measuring the postnatal offspring weight changes (optional)\nTo prepare for the offspring weight analysis, cull litters to 6 pups per litter on the day of birth (postnatal day 0, PN0).\nRecord the weight of pups on PN0 and at different time points during the postnatal period (PN2, 7, 15, 21).\nSubscription Required.
