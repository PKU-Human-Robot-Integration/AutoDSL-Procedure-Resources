    "Adult dermal fibroblasts were obtained from the Parkinson's Disease Research and Huntington's disease clinics at the John van Geest Centre for Brain Repair (Cambridge, UK) and used under local ethical approval (REC 09/H0311/88). For details on the skin biopsy sampling procedure, see reference8.\n1. Preparation of Skin Fibroblasts for Reprogramming\nUsing an automated cell thawing system or a 37 °C water bath, thaw the adult human dermal fibroblasts (aHDFs) and plate 200,000 per T75 flask (count with an automated cell counter) in 10 mL of fibroblast medium (see Table 1) at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nPerform a complete medium change with fibroblast medium on the next day.\nChange the fibroblast medium every 3–4 days until the cells reach 95% confluency.\n\tNOTE: One confluent flask will contain approximately 1,000,000 cells. The aHDFs can be frozen to build a stock of the cell line (section 2) or directly re-plated ready for reprogramming (section 3).\n2. Freezing of Skin Fibroblasts\nPlace a controlled-rate freezing container in a box with ice or in the fridge at 4 °C.\nDissociate the cells with 0.05% trypsin (1.5 mL per T75 flask) at 37 °C for 3–5 min.\nAdd fibroblast medium (containing fetal bovine serum (FBS)) to neutralize the trypsin (3 mL per flush per T75 flask) and collect the detached cells in a 15 mL tube by flushing out the cells in the flask twice.\nCount the cells using the automated cell counter; (recommended) freeze approximately 500,000 aHDFs per vial.\nSpin down the cells at 400 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of freezing medium (see Table 1) and transfer into the cryogenic tube. Place the tubes directly into the controlled-rate freezing container.",
    "Store the controlled rate freezing apparatus at -80 °C overnight. The following day, transfer the tubes to a -140 °C freezer and store until needed.\n3. Plating for Reprogramming (Day −1)\nNOTE: It is recommended to use a gelatin coating for short term experiments (up to 30 days); alternatively, for long term experiments it is recommended to start on a poly-L-ornithine, fibronectin and laminin (PFL) coating.\n60 min before plating the aHDFs for reprogramming, coat a 24-well plate with 0.1% gelatin (250 µL/well) and incubate at 37 °C.\nAspirate the fibroblast medium on the aHDFs. Wash once with DPBS. Dissociate the cells with 0.05% trypsin (1.5 mL per T75 flask) at 37 °C for 3–5 min.\nAdd fibroblast medium to neutralize the trypsin (3 mL per flush per T75 flask) and collect the detached cells in a 15 mL tube by flushing out the cells in the flask twice.\nSpin down the cells at 400 x g for 5 min. Discard supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of fibroblast medium.\nCount the cells using an automated cell counter (to ensure a good quality conversion check that the cell viability is above 90% with trypan blue staining).\nFor a complete 24-well plate, prepare a suspension of 1,320,000 cells in 13.2 mL of fibroblast medium to achieve a suspension of 100,000 cells/mL of medium (or 55,000 cells/well in 550 µL of fibroblast medium multiplied by the number of wells needed).\nAspirate the gelatin from the plate and wash twice with DPBS. Add 500 µL of the cell suspension to each well and incubate overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\n4. Viral Transduction (Day 0)",
    "NOTE: Working with lentiviral particles requires category 2 equipment and the use of an agent to neutralize the virus. Wearing double pairs of gloves is also strongly recommended.\nWarm up 13.2 mL of fibroblast medium to 37 °C.\nThaw a lentiviral vector containing the transcription factors Ascl1 and Brn2 with two short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) targeting REST at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Refer to reference8; the construct is available in a plasmid repository. For details on the procedure to produce lentiviruses please refer to reference9.\nAdd the necessary volume of lentivirus to infect the aHDFs at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20 to the medium without any transduction enhancers.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56904/56904eq1v2.jpg\nReplace the medium in the 24-well plate with fibroblast medium containing the lentiviral vector (500 µL/well) and incubate overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nThe next day, replace the medium in the wells with fresh fibroblast medium without the lentiviral vector.\n\tNOTE: The medium is considered infectious for 7 days and as such, adequate protection and handling procedures should be used during the first week following viral transduction.\n5. Maintenance of the Converting Cells\nNOTE: Once conversion begins cells are susceptible to lifting; take care to tip the plate up and use a 1,000 µL pipette when removing media to avoid cells detaching.\nOn day 3, remove the fibroblast medium and add 500 µL of early neuronal conversion medium (see Table 1).\nTwo to three times a week, take out 225 µL of old medium from the well and add-in 250 µL of fresh early neuronal conversion medium.\nOn day 18, remove all of the medium from each well and replace with 500 µL of late neuronal conversion medium (see Table 1).",
    "Continue to change half of the medium as above with late neuronal conversion medium every 2–3 days until day 25 or experiment endpoint (Figure 1A).\n\tNOTE: If cells are not plated in every well for the experiment, fill empty wells with PBS or water to prevent overt evaporation of the medium and minimize variation between wells.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\n,Stock Concentration,Working Concentration\nFibroblast medium,Fibroblast medium,Fibroblast medium\nBasal medium,,\nPenicillin/Streptomycin,\"10,000 U/mL\",100 mg/mL\nFBS,,10%\nFreezing medium,Freezing medium,Freezing medium\nFibroblast medium,,45%\nFBS,,45%\nDMSO,,10%\nEarly neuronal conversion medium (ENM),Early neuronal conversion medium (ENM),Early neuronal conversion medium (ENM)\nNeural differentiation medium,,\nPenicillin/Streptomycin,\"10,000 U/mL\",100 mg/mL\nCHIR99021,10 mM,2 µM\nSB-431542,20 mM,10 µM\nNoggin,100 µg/mL,0.5 µg/mL\nLDN-1931189,10 mM,0.5 µM\nVPA,1 M,1 mM\nLM-22A4,20 mM,2 µM\nGDNF,20 µg/mL,2 ng/mL\nNT3,10 µg/mL,10 ng/µL\ndb-cAMP,50 mM,0.5 mM\nLate neuronal conversion medium (LNM),Late neuronal conversion medium (LNM),Late neuronal conversion medium (LNM)\nNeural differentiation medium,,\nPenicillin/Streptomycin,\"10,000 U/mL\",100 mg/mL\nLM-22A4,20 mM,2 µM\nGDNF,20 µg/mL,2 ng/mL\nNT3,10 µg/mL,10 ng/µL\ndb-cAMP,50 mM,0.5 mM\nFACS Buffer,FACS Buffer,FACS Buffer\n\"HBSS 1x [-calcium, -magnesium, - phenol red]\",,\nBSA,,1%\nDNAase,,0.05%\nTable 1: Composition of the different media used.

Glass Coverslips for Electrophysiological Recordings\nNOTE: It is recommended to wear a lab coat, goggles, double gloves, and complete all of the work in a fume hood. This protocol is adapted from 10.\nPlace glass coverslips at the bottom of a glass dish without overlap.\nAdd general lab cleaning detergent to submerge all of the coverslips without risking overflow during shaking (approximately 30 mL). Place onto an orbital shaker at slow speed for 2 h.\nWash six times (30 min each) with autoclaved deionized water.\nAdd 95% ethanol for 2 h.",
    "Remove the ethanol and wait until coverslips are dry.\nOnce dry, transfer the coverslips into a glass beaker and add 70% nitric acid until the coverslips are submerged.\nPlace the glass beaker into a sonicator bath for 60 min.\nRemove the nitric acid and wash three times with autoclaved deionized water.\n\tCaution: Always add acid to water, never the other way around as this can lead to a violent reaction.\nRemove as much water from the beaker as possible and add concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCI) until the coverslips are submerged; swirl the beaker and cover with paraffin film.\nSonicate for 60 min (50–60 Hz, 30 W).\nRemove as much HCI from coverslips as possible and place into an appropriate waste bin. Rinse with autoclaved deionized water twice.\nTake the coverslips out of the hood and rinse 20 times (or more) with autoclaved deionized water until all of the HCI is removed.\nOnce dry, place coverslips into sterile 24-well plates.\nPlace the plates under ultraviolet (UV) light overnight. The next day the coverslips are ready to use.\n\tNOTE: If glass coverslips are being used, it is recommended to use the PFL coating. Simply place one coverslip into each well of a 24-well plate (using sterile forceps) and follow the protocol as below.\n7. PFL Coating for Long Term Culture\nCoat the 24-well plate with poly-L-ornithine (500 µL/well) and leave overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nAspirate the poly-L-ornithine and wait until it is dry enough to form drops on top.\nMake a drop (approximately 60 µL) of laminin in the center of each well and spread to cover the entire surface of the coverslip. Leave for 2 h 45 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nWash three times with DPBS.",
    "Add fibronectin (500 µL/well) and leave overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\nWash once with DPBS before adding cells.\n\tNOTE: The PFL coating can be used for long term cultures of iNs (over 100 days), although progressive cell death is to be expected from day 30.\n8. FACS\nNOTE: To re-plate the cells after FACS sorting prepare a PFL-coated plate 48 h in advance. Cells can be sorted using a neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) antibody from day 20 onwards following transduction.\nRemove the media with a 1,000 µL pipette (do not wash to avoid cells detaching).\nAdd cell dissociating agent (250 µL/well), leave for 10–20 min until the cells lift, and float as single cells.\nDuring this time prepare the FACS buffer.\nTriturate gently with a 1,000 µL pipette. If some clumps remain, incubate a little bit longer.\nOnce a single cell suspension is obtained, remove it from the well and place into a 1.5 mL tube.\nFlush out the well twice with late neuronal conversion medium and place into the same 1.5 mL tube.\nSpin down at 400 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 200 µL of FACS buffer.\nSpin down the cells at 400 x g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nRepeat steps 8.8 and 8.9 twice.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 50 µL of FACS buffer containing human CD56 (NCAM) antibody at a concentration of 1:50 for 15 min on ice. Protect from light.\nSpin down the cells at 400 x g for 5 min.\nResuspend in 200 µL FACS buffer to wash and spin down the cells at 400 x g for 5 min.\nRepeat step 8.13.",
    "Resuspend in 200 µL of FACS buffer containing propidium iodide (PI; 10 µg/mL). Sort the NCAM positive (iNs) and PI negative (live) cells using FACS by gating based on the fluorescence intensity level of control samples that were not stained with the NCAM antibody or PI.\nCollect the NCAM positive cells in a tube containing late neuronal conversion medium.\nCount the cells using an automated cell counter and re-plate the cells at a high density (50,000 cells/cm2) in late neuronal conversion medium in a PFL coated dish.\nContinue to change half of the medium 2–3 times a week with late neuronal conversion medium until the experiment endpoint (Figure 1A)."
