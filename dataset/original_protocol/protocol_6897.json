    "Figure 1 illustrates the steps for virus production, quantitation, and infection. A detailed description of the procedures is found in the following items.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4072/bioprotoc-11-13-4072-g001.jpgFigure 1. Different steps for the production, quantitation, and infection of Icoaraci Phlebovirus. Figure created in the Mind the Graph platform.Production of the Icoaraci Phlebovirus Plate 4 × 106 BHK-21 cells in 100-mm plates (7 ml/plate). In order to obtain a good virus concentration, seed approximately 30 plates. For this step, use BHK cells that have undergone no more than five passages.After exactly 24 h, wash the cells once with 2 ml warm PBS and proceed with viral absorption (next step).Dilute the virus in 1 ml DMEM without FBS [multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.01] and absorb the inoculum for 2 h at room temperature. The inoculum volume is not sufficient to cover the whole plate surface, so please move the plate carefully every 20 min to allow the inoculum to move across the plate.Remove the inoculum, add 7 ml DMEM (supplemented with 10% FBS) (Recipe 1), and incubate at 37°C for 3 days.Collect the supernatant and centrifuge at 18,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C to concentrate the virus.Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 300 µl PBS. Split the volume between 3 cryovials and store at -80°C until the titration.Quantitation of the Icoaraci Phlebovirus Viral titers are determined using a plaque assay. For this, plate 1.5 × 106 BHK-21 cells/well in a 6-well plate. Cells should be used up to a maximum of passage 3.After 24 h, infect the cells (~80% confluence) with 200 µl 10-fold serial dilution of ICOV stock, as described in the previous section, and incubate for 2 h at room temperature.",
    "Again, the inoculum volume is not sufficient to cover the well surface, so please move the plate carefully every 20 min to allow the inoculum to move across the plate.Using a pipette, remove the inoculum completely and cover the monolayer with 2 ml semi-solid medium composed of complete DMEM plus 1% methylcellulose (Recipe 2). In this step, it is very important to ensure complete removal of the inoculum in order for the semi-solid medium to be evenly distributed throughout the cell monolayer.Three days post-infection, fix and stain the cells with 2 ml 0.1% crystal violet solution containing 10% formaldehyde (Recipe 3) under slight agitation for 12 h at room temperature.Wash the wells delicately with running water to remove the fixative/dye and allow the plate to dry upside down at room temperature for 24 h. Viral plaques can be counted on the white-light transilluminator, and titers are expressed as plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4072/bioprotoc-11-13-4072-g002.jpgFigure 2. Quantitation of Icoaraci Phlebovirus. The supernatant from 48 h after infection was collected, diluted to three different concentrations (10-2, 10-3, and 10-4), and titrated in a BHK-21 monolayer as described above. After 3 days, the cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet.Obtaining and cultivating peritoneal macrophagesMouse colonies are maintained at the Department of Immunology, UFRJ in accordance with the rules established by the National Council for the Control of Animal Experimentation. The animal experimentation protocols used in this project were approved by the Animal Use Ethics Committee (Protocol No. 046/20).Peritoneal macrophages from 8-week-old C57 Black-6 (C57BL/6) mice are elicited with 2 ml 3% sodium thioglycolate (intraperitoneal injection, Recipe 8) for 4 days, and cells are obtained after euthanization by injecting 8 ml DMEM into the peritoneal cavity.",
    "The mice were inclined at a 45° angle with the head down, positioning the intestines cranially, away from the administration area. The needle was then inserted in the lower right quadrant of the abdomen at a 30-45° angle for either the inoculation of thioglycolate or to obtain macrophages.Centrifuge the cells at 400 × g for 10 min at 4°C.Resuspend the cells in 1 ml DMEM and count using a hemocytometer under the microscope (10× dilution in the Neubauer chamber with DMEM).Plate the macrophages on glass coverslips in 24-well plates (2 × 105 cells per well) or 6-well plates (4 × 106 cells per well).After a 1-h adherence at 37°C, wash the cells with PBS and add complete DMEM. The macrophages are kept for 1 day at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and subsequently subjected to infection.InfectionFor peritoneal macrophage ICOV infections, adsorption is performed for 1 h at 37°C using an MOI of 1.Dilute the virus in DMEM without FBS and use 100 µl for 24-well plates and 1 ml for 6-well plates.Remove the inoculum with a pipette and add 1 ml (24-well plate) or 2 ml (6-well plate) complete DMEM.The subsequent treatment time, conditions, or other additional infections for which the experimental model is proposed may vary. For example, in Leishmania infections, we allow the parasite to interact for 4 h after viral adsorption and then lyse the cells for analysis of gene expression by qPCR.Analysis of murine macrophage infection by semiquantitative PCR for viral detectionTo detect and confirm the viral infection and replication in peritoneal macrophages, a semiquantitative PCR must be performed.After 4, 24, or 48 h of infection, isolate and purify the total RNA using the Direct-zolTM RNA MiniPrep Plus kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.Quantitate the RNA using the NanoDrop.",
    "The expected concentration should be 100-200 ng/µl, and the 260/280 ratio should be 1.8-2.0, ensuring good RNA quality.First-strand cDNA synthesis is performed in a reaction containing Improm-II Reverse Transcriptase, a mix of dNTPs, and random primers, as described in the manufacturer's instructions.RT-PCR is performed using 10 µM primers for the N protein gene of ICOV (sense 5’-AGGTGAGGCTGTAAATCTTG-3’ and antisense 5’-TCACATCATCCTTCCAAGTG-3’), 2.5 U GoTaq DNA polymerase, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dNTPs, 2 µl cDNA, and 1× appropriate buffer in a final volume of 50 µl. The PCR cycle is as follows: 95°C for 1 min, 48°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min in 40 amplification cycles.PCR products are separated on a 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.5 µg/ml ethidium bromide in 1× TAE buffer (Recipe 5) at 80-100 V and photographed in a UV transilluminator. The product has 100 bp (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4072/bioprotoc-11-13-4072-g003.jpgFigure 3. Peritoneal macrophages from wild-type C57BL/6 mice were infected with stationary-phase promastigotes of L. (L.) amazonensis at a ratio of 5 parasites/cell, Icoaraci Phlebovirus (ICOV), or co-infected with both for 4 h, 24 h, or 48 h. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by semiquantitative PCR for the Icoaraci N protein."
