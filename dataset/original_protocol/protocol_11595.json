    "All rats are treated according to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. Approval for all the experimental procedures was granted by the Concordia University Animal Research Ethics Committee.\n1. Animals\nAcquire Long Evans rats weighing 275-300 g (males) or 225-250 g (females). Double house rats in standard plastic cages with corncob bedding and shredded paper until surgery.\nKeep the rats on a reversed light-dark cycle (lights off at 9:30 AM, light on at 9:30 PM).\nAllow unlimited access to food and water, except during the food-deprivation test. Use regular rat chow (20.9% protein, 67.2% carbohydrates, and 11.8% fat).\n2. Intravenous surgeries\nBuild catheters and perform intravenous surgery as described in Sedki et al. 201317 with the following differences: 1) Use Isofluorane 2-2.5% for anesthesia, 2) Change the dose of penicillin administered during surgery to 60 000 IU/rat, via subcutaneous injection, and 3) Increase the dose of gentamicin in the mixture of heparin and gentamicin used to flush the catheters to 7.5 IU + 800 µg; 0.2- 0.3 mL.\nInject ketoprofen or carprofen, an anti-inflammatory analgesic, intraperitoneally or subcutaneously (5 mg/kg) immediately after surgery (before recovery from the anesthesia) and on the following 3 days. During the 2 days recovery period, give mashed food and heat (if necessary) to help with the recovery. Weigh and supervise the animals daily to check for any abrupt loss of weight or any other signs of health issues.\n3. Behavioral procedure\nOperant conditioning chambers:\n\t\nSet the operant conditioning chambers as described in Sedki et al. 201317.\nHabituation day:\n\t\nHouse the rats in the operant training chambers after recovery from surgery and allow animals to habituate to the chamber for 24 h before initiating any protocol. Keep animals housed in the operant chambers throughout the whole experiment.",
    "Do not attach the rats to the metal spring and do not initiate any experimental protocol (the cue-light, the tone, and the levers are not available during habituation day).\nHeroin self-administration:\n\t\nAttach the 5-up connector to the Tygon tube and the metal spring.\nSet up daily training sessions of 6 h of heroin self-administration (0.1 mg/kg/infusion) according to the procedure described below.\nStart daily training sessions on the onset of the dark phase of the reversed light cycle (around 9:30 AM in the representative results) with the extension of the seek lever (or take lever on the first 2 days; see below), as well as turning off the houselight on.\nSelf-administration with only the take lever available under fixed-ratio 1 (FR1; 2 days)\n\t\t\nProgram each trial to begin with the insertion of the take lever.\nOnce the rat presses the take lever one time (FR1), retract the take lever, turn on the cue light above the lever and tone for a 20 s timeout period, turn off the houselight, and allow the delivery of a heroin infusion (0.1 mg/kg in 0.13 mL)\nProgram a 30 s inter-trial interval in which no cues are presented, the houselight is turned off, and the lever is retracted. For the beginning of the next trial, insert the take lever, and turn on the houselight.\nSelf-administration with seek-take chain under FR1 (5 days)\n\t\t\nProgram the operant training system to insert only the seek lever and turn on the houselight to signal the beginning of the session. The take lever is in a retracted state.\nOnce the rat presses one time (FR1) on the seek lever, the program retracts the seek lever and inserts the take lever.",
    "One press on the take lever (FR1) retracts the take lever and initiates the same procedure as in step 3.3.4.2 and a 30 s inter-trial interval.\nProgram the operant training system to insert the seek lever at the conclusion of the inter-trial interval and turn on the houselight to signal the beginning of the next trial.\nProgram the operant training system to initiate the inter-trial interval if a rat fails to accomplish the seek-take chain during 10 min (not pressing the seek or the take lever) to represent the end of a trial and the loss of the opportunity to administer the drug.\nSelf-administration with seek-take chain under Variable Intervals (VI5, VI30, and VI60)\n\t\t\nProgram all steps in section 3.3.5 but introduce a variable interval of 5 (VI5) as the new schedule of reinforcement on the seek lever, instead of FR1. Allow self-administration training under the VI5 schedule for 3 days.\nSet up the software to allow the first press on the seek lever to activate the VI5 schedule. For the VI5 schedule, let the software to randomly select an interval time from a list of 0.1 s, 5 s, and 10 s, which results in an average of 5 s interval. The first seek lever press after the selected interval has elapsed, retracts the seek lever and extends the take lever.\nFollow steps 3.3.4.2, 3.3.5.4., 3.3.5.5. for take lever and end of trial instructions.\nNext, train rats for 5 days under VI30 schedule for the seek link, followed by 3 days under VI60 schedule.",
    "For the VI30 schedule, allow the software to randomly select a time from a list of 15 s, 30 s, and 45 s, for an average of 30 s, whereas for the VI60 schedule, the software randomly selects a time from a list of 45 s, 60 s, and 75 s.\nVary the inter-trial intervals along the different schedules of reinforcement. Start the inter-trial interval at 30 s during FR1 and VI5 but gradually increase to 7 min during VI30 and VI60.\nPunishment-imposed abstinence\n\t\nStart punishment sessions with insertion of seek lever and turning the houselight on. Allow punishment sessions for 8 days, with regular supervision to guarantee that animals do not show signs of abnormal pain or any health issues.\nProgram the operant training system so that after completing the seek link under VI60, the seek lever retracts, the houselight is turned off, and a mild footshock is administered on 30% of the completed seek links instead of insertion of the take lever. The take lever extends on the other 70% of completed seek links, as in a normal self-administration trial.\nProgram an inter-trial interval of 7 min with all cues and houselight off before inserting the seek lever and turning the houselight on to signal the beginning of the next trial.\nSet the footshock intensity at 0.2 mA and increase by 0.1 mA per punishment day until 1.0 mA.\nAfter rats press the take lever (on trials when it is available), repeat step 3.3.4.2 for retraction of the lever, delivery of the heroin infusion, and presentation of cues, followed by a 7 min inter-trial interval.\nStart the next trial with the insertion of the seek lever and turning the houselight on.\nIf the rat does not press any lever for 10 min, follow step 3.3.5.5.",
    "Acute food deprivation (24 h)\n\t\nOn the day following the last day of punishment-imposed abstinence, divide rats into two matched groups (according to body weight and the average number of seek lever and infusions over the last 3 days of self-administration training): Food Deprived (FD) and Sated.\nRemove food hoppers from the chambers (around 9:30 AM) for rats that undergo food deprivation-induced relapse test and keep food hoppers for the sated group that has unlimited access to food. Provide unlimited access to water in both groups and supervise animals to guarantee that they do not show any health problems during the food deprivation period.\nFood deprivation-induced heroin seeking tests\n\t\nThe morning after the 24 h of food deprivation, perform a 3 h heroin-seeking test, under a VI60 schedule with an inter-trial interval of 7 min with no shock or heroin infusions being delivered. Return food hoppers to the food-deprived rats after the 3 h session.\nOn the morning after the first heroin seeking test, remove food hoppers from the chambers of the rats that were sated on the first relapse test. Allow the rats that were previously food-deprived unlimited access to food (sated condition) before and during the test.\nPerform another 3 h heroin seeking test on the next day (after 24 h food deprivation), as in step 3.6.1.\nThe day after the test euthanize the rats using a carbon dioxide chamber (100% CO2 at fill rate of 30-70% of the chamber volume per minute).\nSubscription Required.
