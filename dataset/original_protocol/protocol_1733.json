This includes 5′ and 3′ UTRs.\nNote: The transcript selection could be a problematic situation due to different splicing versions; therefore, we recommend selecting the longest transcript and then choose exons that are shared in all splice variants. If RNAseq data is available, it is convenient to select exons where RNA is clearly detected. And the targeted sequence can be analyzed to rule out potential mutations; however, as it will be discussed later that this step is not required.\ngRNAs design\nTiming: 30 min",
    "So far, there is not a systematic method or algorithm to design CRISPR-RfxCas13d gRNA to be injected into animal embryos. Two alternative methods have been tested with variable gRNA activity in vivo. First, gRNA design can be based on target accessibility according to the data in mammalian cell culture where gRNA activity is highly associated with target accessibility based on the three-dimensional conformation of the mRNA targets (Abudayyeh et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Kushawah et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6])) (option 1). Alternatively, there is a new approach for gRNA design according to an analysis in mammalian cell culture experiments that also proposes new gRNAs optimizations (Wessels et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). This gRNA design tool efficiently predicts CRISPR-RfxCas13d activity in mammalian cell culture experiments where gRNA and RfxCas13d expression is driven by constitutive promoters (Wessels et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) (option 2). Additionally, the tool also predicts potential off-targets in silico (0, 1, 2 mismatches between gRNA and RNA target). While this algorithm can efficiently predict CRISPR-RfxCas13d in mammalian cell culture, it has not been systematically tested in animal embryos. Therefore, in this protocol, we detail the different steps for the gRNAs design for both methods. Since none of the methods ensures that selected gRNAs are highly efficient in vivo, we recommend designing 3 gRNAs for each gene in the coding sequence region where the targeting is generally more efficient (Kushawah et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Wessels et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) with 50 nt of distance between them to avoid potential competition between gRNAs to access the target.\nNote: We highly recommend designing and using an additional set of 3 gRNAs that can help to validate and confirm potential phenotypes and rule out off-target effects (see mRNA knockdown validation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.11] section).",
    "Note: If you choose to follow option 1 (gRNAs design based on target accessibility), proceed to step 2 and then follow steps 4–75. If you want to use option 2 (gRNAs design based on Wessels et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]) proceed to step 3 and then follow to steps 4–75.\nOption 1 – Target accessibility in silico\nTo find the most convenient mRNA region to be targeted, an in silico analysis is performed using RNAfold software (http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at//cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi[href=http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.at//cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi]) (Lorenz et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]):\nCopy your cDNA sequence and paste it into the box.\nSelect the following options: minimum free energy (MFE) and partition function, avoid isolated base pairs, interactive RNA secondary structure plot, RNA secondary structure plots with reliability annotation (Partition function folding only) and Mountain plot.\nSelect: Proceed.\nSelect: color by base-pairing probability.\nSearch for protospacers of 22–23 nt with higher accessibility in silico (low base-pairing probability from minimum free energy predictions), blue or green regions, that belong to the Coding Sequence (CDS) and select 3 different protospacer spaced out across the transcript with a minimum distance of 50 nt between them to avoid an overlap between gRNAs, whenever possible (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "(B) qRT-PCR analysis showing the levels of tbxta mRNA in zebrafish embryos at 5 h post fertilization (hpf). Embryos were injected with 3 ng of RfxCas13d protein (Cas13d) and 300 pg of 3 gRNAs (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) targeting the ORF of tbxta mRNA. Different in vitro transcribed gRNAs were used: while gNTL-WT has the wild-type stem loop and a spacer of 22 nt, gNTL-SLD has the stem loop disruption described in Wessels et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] and a spacer of 23 nt. Results are shown as the averages ± standard deviation of the mean from two independents experiments with two biological replicates (n = 10 embryos) per experiment ∗∗∗ p< 0.001, ∗∗∗∗ p< 0.0001; (One-way anova).\n(C) No-tail phenotype severity after knockdown of tbxta mRNA in similar conditions described in panel (B).

    "(E) Phenotypes obtained after injection of the Cas13d and the gRNAs (WT or optimized) targeting tbxta in zebrafish embryos (Lateral views). Levels of mosaicism compared to wild type (WT) were evaluated at 28 hpf. Class I: Short tail (least extreme). Class II: Absence of notochord and short tail (medium level). Class III: Absence of notochord and extremely short tail (most extreme). Scale bar, 0.25 mm.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1322_7.csv\nBold and blue sequence indicates the protospacer sequence of 22 nt (WT).\nNote: Recently, spacers of 23 nt and with a disruption in the first base-pair of the gRNA proximal stem loop have been shown to enhance the mRNA targeting in mammalian cell culture (Wessels et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). We have tested this enhanced gRNA version with a spacer of 23 nt and the stem loop disruption in zebrafish embryos (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) and we have also observed a slightly higher efficiency (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) that can be translated in higher phenotype penetrance (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). However, we have found that these optimized gRNAs are frequently in vitro transcribed at lower efficiency (likely due to the modification in the stem loop disruption) potentially limiting their use (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). For this reason, we normally generate gRNAs containing a spacer of 22–23 nt with the wild-type stem loop by in vitro transcription (IVT) and we preferentially order chemically synthesized gRNAs when they have the stem loop disruption and a spacer of 23 nt. In this protocol, we will detail the generation of gRNA by IVT for the CRISPR-RfxCas13d system with the 22 nt spacer and the wild-type stem loop structure.\nOption 2 – Mammalian cell culture-based algorithm\nSearch for https://cas13design.nygenome.org/[href=https://cas13design.nygenome.org/] to the gRNA design according to Wessels et al. (2020)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10].\nSelect the model organism and select your model of interest.",
    "Introduce the transcript ID of your interest target gene. (Also, you can search the transcript ID in the table using the gene symbol or gene name).\nIntroduce the Ensembl transcript ID in the search box.\nSelect the top 3 gRNAs targeting the Coding Sequence since gRNAs targeting UTR are less efficient (Wessels et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Kushawah et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nNote: Selected gRNAs using this approach will have spacers of 23 nt.\nThe DNA template to generate the gRNA is produced by fill-in-PCR with a universal primer and a specific primer. The universal primer (imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fx8.jpg) contains the T7 promoter (in pink) and the processed direct repeat for RfxCas13d crRNAs (in blue) preceded by 5′GG. Specific primer (imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fx9.jpg) contains the binding specific sequence (in green) and 20 nt of the repeat sequence in reverse complement orientation (in blue) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: The “5-GG” in the universal primer is required for the efficient in vitro transcription reaction mediated by T7 RNA polymerase.\nNote: Spacers can have 23 nt with the wild type stem loop but we did not systematically compare the efficiency of this formulation to others discussed here.\nNote: If a gRNA with the stem loop disruption wants to be generated, the universal would be: imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fx10.jpg\nNote: For example, injection of the mRNA encoding for RfxCas13d with gRNA targeting tbxta mRNA in zebrafish embryos should compromise notochord formation as well as a lack of posterior structures (no-tail phenotype). We selected 3 protospacers (22 nt) for the targeting of tbxta after the in-silico analysis: imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fx11.jpg (in this case we selected them based on option 1 corresponding to regions with low probability of base pairing in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). To generate the DNA Template, we order the following primers:",
    "Universal primer: This sequence contains the T7-promoter and the processed direct repeat for RfxCas13d preceded by 5′GG: imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fx12.jpg Specific primers: This sequence contains 22nt of the specific protospacer and 20 nt of the repeat sequence in reverse complement orientation. Example primers for targeting tbxta mRNA:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1322_8.csv\nNote: gRNAs oligos can be ordered through companies such as IDT (www.idtdna.com[href=http://www.idtdna.com]). Oligos can be purchased as desalted and in minimal amounts.\nAlternatives: gRNAs can be ordered as chemically synthesized directly through companies such as Synthego (https://www.synthego.com/company[href=https://www.synthego.com/company]). In that case, it is not necessary to include the 5′-GG, and the gRNA sequence is the correspond tail (processed direct repeat, Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]) of RfxCas13d gRNAs (imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fx16.jpg) plus the reverse-complement of the 22–23 nt protospacer sequence (in green). Indeed, we mainly order chemically synthesized enhanced gRNAs (mentioned above) containing the stem loop disruption and a spacer of 23 nt (Wessels et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nExample of enhanced chemically synthesized gRNAs for targeting tbxta mRNA:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1322_9.csv\nCritical: Currently, the design of gRNAs for RfxCas13d for targeting in vivo has some limitations, since there is not a validated strategy predictions model to design and select efficient gRNAs for in vivo approaches, and we have found gRNAs with low activity. To increase the probability of having a high level of depletion, we use 3–4 gRNAs together targeting the same RNA. In addition to using 3–4 gRNAs, we also recommend using individual gRNAs that have been tested to show higher mRNA depletion (see mRNA knockdown validation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.11] section), to minimize potential off-target effects and to provide reproducible results independent of the guide used.",
    "Note: We have observed that chemically synthesized gRNAs, either with wild type or disrupted stem loop, enhance the targeting of maternally provided in zebrafish embryos (Kushawah et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). That could be related with the highly purity and quality of these gRNAs and their more robust production since in vitro transcription may have byproducts and frequently show variability in the gRNA production among different DNA templates for distinct gRNAs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic representation of the fill-in-PCR to generate the DNA template\nThe Universal Primer contains the T7 promoter followed by 5′GG and the processed direct repeat for RfxCas13d gRNA, meanwhile, the Specific Primer contains the repeat sequence in reverse complement orientation to hybrid with the universal primer and the specific binding sequence of 22 nt. The product of the Fill-in-PCR is the DNA template that contains the T7 promoter with the 2 “GG” (19 nt), the processed direct repeat (30 nt) and the specific binding site sequence (22nt).\nDNA template generation\nTiming: 3 h\nAnneal universal primer and specific primer.\nMix the following reagents:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1322_10.csv\nEnter the following program in a thermocycler:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1322_11.csv\nNote: If several gRNAs are used to target one gene in the same injection, the specific gRNA primers can be mixed in equimolar concentrations and then use 5 μL of this mix (100 μM of the total gRNA primer content) in the PCR reaction and a single in vitro transcription reaction is performed in the next step. Alternatively, each gRNA can be generated individually and be purified together in the same column (considering the maximal amount of RNA that each column can purify). Finally, gRNAs can be individually produced, purified and quantified and mixed at equal concentrations to generate the pool.",
    "Note: To increase the amount of DNA template, several replicates of the PCR can be performed and then mixed to carry out a single purification.\nNote: Since each gRNA-DNA template will be different, annealing temperature could be modified. Negative controls with universal or specific primers alone can be run to ensure that PCR bands are correct.\nAlternatives: Another DNA Polymerase could be used to generate the DNA -template, in that case, follow the protocol according to the manufacturer’s directions.\nRun PCR products (5 μL) plus 1 μL of Loading Dye (6×) in a 2% agarose gel, in TAE Buffer 1×. A single specific band of less than 100 nt is expected if the Fill-in-PCR has been successful (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nPurify the rest of the PCR product (at least 20 μL) using PCR/DNA Purification Kit[href=http://www.favorgen.com/port_pro1.php?type_1=pro_v_p11&id_1=dis15b9a6fd7ed641] (FavorPrep GEL/ PCR Purification Kit; FAGCK 001).

Stand the FADF Column for 1 min at room temperature.\nCritical: For effective elution, make sure that the elution solution is dispensed onto the membrane center and is absorbed completely.\nCritical: Elution should be performed with nuclease free water to avoid RNase contamination.\nNote: To work with a more concentrated template 30 μL of water can be used to elute, but we do not recommend using less than 30 μL because this could reduce the yield of DNA elution.\nCentrifuge at full speed (∼18,000g) for 1 min to elute the DNA.\nPause point: DNA template product can be kept at −20°C for several months.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

RfxCas13d-NLS can be useful to target mRNAs that are exclusively or preferentially localized in the nucleus such as some lncRNAs, pri-miRNAs, etc. Although we have not systematically tested this RfxCas13d version, we have observed that the targeting efficiency of Rfx-Cas13d-NLS may be lower in zebrafish embryos compared to RfxCas13d without NLS (Kushawah et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). However, this is not due to a lower in vivo translation (Kushawah et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) or a lack of robust nuclear localization (data not shown) that could potentially reduce RNA targeting activity in the nucleus.\nNote: See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3] for potential solutions related to low RfxCas13d mRNA production.\nPreparation of RfxCas13d protein expressing bacterial colonies\nTiming: 3 days\nThe RfxCas13d protein could be purified using Histidine tag and directly injected in zebrafish embryos at 1-cell stage. It has been demonstrated that the use of RfxCas13d protein enhances the maternal mRNA targeting in zebrafish embryos (Kushawah et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nIn this step, the E. coli Rosetta DE3 pRARE strain is chemically transformed (Chung et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Other transformation methods or E. coli strains can be employed to afford RfxCas13d producing bacteria (i.e., we tested other E. coli BL21 DE3 based strains with positive induction results). However, induction parameters (temperature, IPTG concentration, and incubation time) have been optimized for this strain and chemical transformation.\nPrepare the following items:",
    "Autoclaved 25 mL of liquid LB broth (Sambrook et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]); 2 × 50 mL Erlenmeyer flasks; 2 × 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes.\nPetri dish with LB-Agar-Chloramphenicol; 2 × Petri dish with LB-Agar-Chloramphenicol-Kanamycin A.\nTSS 2× buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for recipes).\nNote: Antibiotic final concentrations are: 15 μg/mL for Chloramphenicol; 25 μg/mL for Kanamycin A for both the agar plates and LB.\nStreak the E. coli Rosetta DE3 pRARE on a LB petri dish with Chloramphenicol 15 μg/mL.\nIncubate the Petri dish at 37°C (16–18 h).\nPause point: After this period, the Petri dish with grown colonies can be stored at 4°C up to 3 weeks.\nPick up a single colony from the previous culture and inoculate 10 mL of liquid LB-Chloramphenicol in a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask.\nCap and incubate the flask at 37°C (16–18 h) while shaking at 180 rpm.\nNext morning, dilute 100 μL of the previous culture with 10 mL of liquid LB-Chloramphenicol into a new 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask.\nCap and incubate the flask at 37°C while shacking up at 180 rpm until an OD600 of 0.3–0.4 is reached (2 h approx.)\nAt OD600 = 0.3–0.4, spin 2× 1 mL of the culture into microcentrifuge tubes (1 mL per tube) at 16000 × g for 30 s at 4°C.\nRemove the supernatants and resuspend the pellets in 75 μL of cold LB.

The other tube is a negative control. Keep the tubes on ice for 30 min.",
    "Incubate the tubes at 42°C for 40 s in a thermo block. Keep both tubes on ice for 1 min.\nAdd 1 mL of LB to each tube and incubate at 37°C for 1.5 h.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 × g for 1 min at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant without touching the pellet and resuspend them in 100 μL of LB.\nSpread the transformed bacteria onto a selective LB-Agar-Chloramphenicol-Kanamycin A petri dish and incubate at 37°C (16–18 h).\nCritical: After this period, one plate should have colonies (the sample that included the plasmid) and the other one should have none (negative control without plasmid).\nPause point: The Petri dish with colonies can be stored at 4°C for up to 2 weeks. It is not recommended to store the transformed Rosetta strain in glycerol as it can accumulate mutations.\nCritical: Hazard Note: Dispose all E. coli cultures following the biosafety protocols and indications that apply in your work institution.\nRfxCas13d protein expression\nTiming: 1.5 days\nIn this step, RfxCas13d protein production will be induced in cultures of previously transformed bacteria. Here we describe the protocol for a 500 mL culture but, if the appropriate equipment is available, it can be scaled up to bigger volumes (e.g.,: in our lab, we have handled up to 2 L of culture at once).\nPrepare the following items:\nAutoclaved: 520 mL of liquid LB broth; 2 × 50 mL Erlenmeyer flasks; 2 L Erlenmeyer flask. Solutions:\nIsopropyl Beta -D-1 thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) solution 1M; Tris·HCl solution 20 mM pH 7.5 (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for recipes).\nA 10% poly-acrylamide gel.\nPick up a single colony from the plate of Rosetta cells previously transformed with pET28b-RfxCas13d and inoculate 10 mL of liquid LB-Chloramphenicol-Kanamycin A in a 50 mL Erlenmeyer flask.",
    "Cap and incubate the flask at 37°C (16–18 h) while shaking at 180 rpm.\nNext morning, dilute 5 mL of the culture in 500 mL of liquid LB-Chloramphenicol-Kanamycin A in a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask.\nCap and incubate the flask at 37°C while shaking at 180 rpm.\nMeasure the culture OD600 periodically (at least every 30 min) using a spectrophotometer and LB as reference blank.\nAt OD600 = 0.45–0.55 (annotate the data. It takes approx. 3 h):\nTransfer 1 mL of the culture into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nSpin at 16,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C, completely remove the supernatant and store the pellet at −20°C (this will be the pre-induction reference).\nAdd 50 μL of 1M IPTG to the Erlenmeyer flask containing the bacterial culture (final IPTG concentration = 0.1 mM) and continue the incubation at 37°C while shaking at 180 rpm for 3 h.\nMeasure the culture OD600 at this point and annotate it. The OD600 should be between 1.5 and 2.15:\nTransfer 1 mL of the culture to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nSpin the tube at 16,000 × g for 1 min at 4°C, completely remove the supernatant and store the pellet at −20°C (this will be the post-induction reference).\nCentrifuge the 500 mL culture at 8,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 20 mL of Tris·HCl 20 mM (pH 7.5).\nCentrifuge at 8,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nDiscard the supernatant and store the pellet at −80°C.\nCritical: Pre-induction and post-induction references (see previous steps 38a-b and 39a-b) must be run in an SDS-PAGE gel to confirm protein induction. A typical example is shown in Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8].",
    "Pause point: The cell pellet can be stored at −80°C for up to 6 months. It can probably be stored for longer without affecting protein quality, but we have not tested this.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8.

The pellets are lysed by sonication and the protein purified by two consecutive chromatography steps (Ni-affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography).\nPrepare the following items:\nBuffers: 300 mL of lysis/binding buffer; 100 mL of elution buffer; 500 mL of dialysis buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for recipes).\n4 × 10% polyacrylamide gels (prepared freshly right before use or stored up to 7 days at 4°C).\nPrepare the chromatography system by properly washing and equilibrating the whole system (including columns) with the corresponding buffer, as well as preparing necessary recipes and microtubes for collecting eluates.\nThaw the bacterial pellet from the previous step on ice for 10 min.\nResuspend the pellet in 50 mL of lysis/binding buffer.\nPlace the cell suspension into a cooling cell in an ice bath and sonicate it with a horn sonicator displaying the following settings: Pulse program, 3 s ON, 10 s OFF, 120 cycles, 30% amplitude.",
    "Note: Previous settings are optimized for our sonicator (Branson SFX 550) with its “Rosette Glass Cooling Cell” and the “High Gain Horn” (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for details). If other equipment is employed, settings might need to be adapted accordingly.\nCritical: Hazard Note: Wear appropriate hearing protection when the sonicator is active.\nCentrifuge the sonicated mixture at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.\nCritical: After centrifugation, the supernatant must remain slightly colored (transparent yellowish) and the pellet must be clearly smaller than before sonication.\nFilter the supernatant through a 0.45 μm PES filter. Save 10 μL of the filtrate as “input reference” for SDS-PAGE, stored on ice.\nFlow the lysate through a His-Trap FF column, pre-equilibrated with lysis/binding buffer, at 1 mL/min and 8°C.

Spin the sample at 4,000 × g at 4°C until the volume reduces to about 1 mL.\nQuantify protein concentration as described in step 60 and stop concentrating when sample reaches ∼3 mg/mL. Make 5 μL aliquots (∼200 1.5 mL tubes) and store them at −80°C. We recommend single use 5 μL aliquots. Additional thaw-frozen cycles can reduce RfxCas13d activity. We recommend to quickly store the aliquots at −80°C and not keep them at 4°C more than the needed time to make the aliquots. Storage at 4°C or −20°C will negatively affect RfxCas13d activity.\nOptional: Although it is not strictly necessary, for the sake of quality control and reproducibility, we strongly recommend the quantification of the sample.\nQuantify the amount of purified RfxCas13d by Bradford densitometry on SDS-PAGE gel employing BSA as reference. RfxCas13d samples must be diluted in a dialysis buffer in a 1 to 20 ratio, loading 2–6 μL of the diluted sample in the gel. With this protocol, we usually obtain a sample concentration of ∼3 mg/mL (a typical example is shown in Figure 11[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig11]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1322-Fig11.jpg",

M is the molecular weight ladder (Precision Plus Protein Standard All Blue – BioRad). The calibration curve and final quantification were performed with the Image Lab software (Bio-Rad).\nCritical: If RfxCas13d must be diluted for any reason, always dilute it using a dialysis buffer. RfxCas13d precipitates if diluted with water.\nAlternatives: Other quantification methods (e.g.: Lowry or BCA based, UV absorption) can be employed instead of the Bradford densitometry. Particularly, we have also quantified RfxCas13d with the RC-DC Protein Assay Kit II (Bio-Rad, #5000122).\nNote: See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] for potential solutions to low RfxCas13d protein production.\nMicroinjection of CRISPR-RfxCas13d system in zebrafish embryos\nTiming: 2 days\nDay 1. Zebrafish Breeding. Separate adult zebrafish of at least 3–4 months old (male/female) in 1 L breeding tanks, using a separating barrier, in the afternoon. We recommend separating 5 males and 5 females in group mating, in a ratio of 1:1.\nNote: Females differ from males by having a bigger belly size, lighter silverish stripes and by the presence of a membrane in the anal fin .\nNote: See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7] for possible solutions to low zebrafish embryo production.",
    "Prepare several agarose plates at 1% of agarose in E3 medium for the maintenance of zebrafish embryos. Plates for microinjection are prepared by adding 2% agarose to E3 medium and placing a plastic mold (teeth down) to make the different lines where the embryos will be placed, while the agarose is still hot (before solidifying). Store the plates upside down at 4°C 1 week as maximum. To avoid potential medium contamination, we recommend not to reuse the plates.\nDay 2. Needle calibration. In the morning, thaw the RfxCas13d mRNA/protein (300 ng/μL and 3 μg/μL, respectively) and gRNAs on ice. Pipette 2 μL of the RfxCas13d mRNA/protein and load into the needle (Harvard, apparatus, 1.0 OD × 0.58 ID × 100 L mm #30-0019 Capillaries GC100F-10) and calibrate the needle using a micrometer calibration slide microscope with 0.01 mm ruler. Using a microinjector (Narishige IM-300) and a stereomicroscope (Leica KL300) and with the help of forceps open the needle end to an adequate size opening. Calibrate the system in order to obtain a bubble of 0.01mm that corresponds to an injection volume of 0.5 nL.\nNote: RfxCas13d mRNA could be diluted in Nuclease-free water meanwhile the RfxCas13d protein must be diluted using the dialysis buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for recipes).\nNote: Needles need to be prepared from glass capillaries with the Flaming/Brown Micropipette Puller (or similar horizontal pullers) and the following conditions: Pull (150), Vel (70), Time (80), Heat (590). Heat temperature is calculated with the Run-Test function that results in the RAMP value, Heat = RAMP value + 30. These conditions may change between different Micropipette Pullers and should be adjusted to the specific model.\nNote: Microinjector pressure should be between 2.0 and 10.0 psi. We recommend a pressure of 6.0–7.0 psi depending on the needle pore size.",
    "Note: RfxCas13d protein calibration could be more complicated due to glycerol content that can clog the needle. We recommend widened needle pore size and inject with a lower pressure (3.0–5.0 psi). If the needle is clogged during the injection, we suggest opening more of the needle and recalibrating it again.\nWhen the zebrafish facility lights turn on in the morning, remove the separating barriers between males and females from the breeding tank. Wait until eggs are laid and collect them from the tank using a strainer. This typically takes about 5–10 min but it can vary.\nDechorionate the embryos using pronase at 1 mg/mL in E3. Incubate the embryos in 3 mL of pronase solution for approximately 2 min.\nNote: Touch a few embryos with the forceps to assure whether the pronase solution is causing a proper dechorionation, if the solution has worked optimality the corium will be removed when is touched with the forceps. We highly recommend to dechorionate the embryos. This will facilitate that the RfxCas13d mRNA/protein and gRNAs are injected into the cell and not in the yolk, which enhances the mRNA targeting. Alternatively, chorionated embryos can be injected but it is important to inject always into the cell.\nCarefully wash the embryos several times (5–7 washes approximately) with new E3 medium in a 250 mL glass beaker and carefully remove the dechorionated embryos with a glass pipette. Repeat this step until most of the embryos are dechorionated.\nCritical: Dechorionated embryos must always be handled with glass material or with agarose gel as alternative.\nPlace 60–70 embryos in each row of the microinjection plate (prepared the day before) with a glass pipette and add a thin overlay of E3 medium to the plate.",
    "Note: You can flame the glass pipette tip just enough to polish it and create a smooth surface that improves embryo survival during manipulations.\nInject each one-cell stage embryo with 1 nL of mix of RfxCas13d purified protein (3.0 μg/L) or mRNA (200–300 ng/μL) and 300–900 ng/μL (individual or mix gRNA final concentration) of gRNA (optimal conditions tested) using the microinjector stereomicroscope. This provides 3 ng of protein or 200–300 pg of mRNA and 300–900 pg of gRNAs per embryo. RfxCas13d protein or mRNA can be mixed in one tube with gRNAs at concentrations described above or to maximize the reagents concentrations two injections can also be performed, 1 nL for RfxCas13d (protein or mRNA) and 1 nL for gRNAs. This can be done when it is not possible to have the optimized concentrations described before in one solution. We have not observed differences between two approaches\nTransfer the embryos to 1% agarose coated plates with E3-medium and keep them at 28°C.\nNote: To enhance the mRNA targeting with the RfxCas13d system we strongly recommend injecting directly 1 nL in the cell of one-cell-stage embryos and we suggest to inject at least 60–70 embryos for each condition.\nCritical: The first cell division takes place 40 min after fertilization in zebrafish embryos but if the embryos are in two-cell-stage it is possible to inject 0.5 nL in each cell. We do not recommend injecting the embryos after the two-cell-stage (1 hpf) because the targeting efficiency can be affected.",
    "Note: Inject 60–70 embryos with RfxCas13d protein or mRNA without gRNA as a control for the early development. These embryos must have a normal development such as a non-injected embryo. gRNAs alone can be also injected as a second control. An additional control could be to inject RfxCas13d mRNA or protein plus a gRNA targeting a sequence that is absent from the Zebrafish Genome.\nNote: As a positive control injecting 3 ng of RfxCas13d purified protein or 200 pg RfxCas13d mRNA and 300 pg of in vitro transcribed gNTL-ctr (tbxta-4, stem loop disrupted and spacer of 23 nt version, Protospacer: 5′CUUUGCUGAAAGAUACGGGUGCT) per embryo. This will generate 80%–90% of zebrafish embryos with extreme no-tail phenotype.\nEmbryos care\nTiming: 24 h\nKeep the injected embryos in an incubator at 28°C in 1% agarose plates with E3 medium.\nRemove the unfertilized egg and dead embryos from the plate at 2 hpf.\nRepeat step 71 at 4 and 6 hpf. If the experiment goes beyond the first 7–8 hpf we recommend to transfer all viable embryos to a new 1% agarose plate with E3 fresh medium prewarm at 28°C\nNote: During these cleaning steps E3 medium will be also removed from the plate. Thus, fresh E3 medium prewarm at 28°C can be added to the plate if needed\nNote: See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9] for possible solutions to percentage of zebrafish embryo survival.\nmRNA knockdown validation\nTiming: 1–4 weeks (qPCR, independent gRNA or mRNA injections) or 1–3 months (RNA-seq)\nDifferent alternatives and complementary methods are proposed here to validate the efficiency of the mRNA knockdown.\nEmploy a mix of different gRNAs targeting the same mRNA to validate the possible phenotype, decrease in mRNA levels and off-target effects obtained with the RfxCas13d system.",
    "Alternatives: Perform mRNA knockdown experiments using new gRNAs or individual gRNAs from the mix injected independently. The use of new gRNAs could confirm the developmental and molecular phenotype in an independent experiment. As an alternative, gRNAs from the mix could be injected independently to confirm the mRNA knockdown and the phenotype but also to analyze what gRNA has the highest efficiency. This single and highly efficient gRNA can be used for future experiments instead of the mix. This can help to reduce potential off-targets from the mix where more gRNAs are used\nAnalyze the mRNA relative levels or your target gene by qPCR analysis or ideally by RNA-seq analysis that will show the whole transcriptome.\nInject a mRNA version resistant to gRNA (with mutations not altering the amino acid sequence) to rescue the phenotype. A titration will be required to ensure that overexpression does not cause any developmental defect. We recommend injecting different concentrations (from 10 to 200 pg per embryo, for example) of resistant mRNA to evaluate overexpression effects and phenotype rescue.\nNote: See troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11] for possible solutions to low or no mRNA depletion."
