    "Culture cells in Tris-acetate-phosphate medium (Gorman and Levine, 1965) with aeration at 22 °C under a 12 h/12 h light/dark cycle (light: ~30 µmol photons m-2 sec-1 white light) to the mid-log phase (~3 x 106 cells/ml).Note: Change the medium and the other culture conditions when necessary.Harvest cells by centrifugation at 600 x g for 5 min at room temperature.Suspend cells in a phototaxis assay buffer at ~1 x 107 cells/ml (for dish assay) or ~1 x 106 cells/ml for quantitative assay in a 50 ml tube.Place the cells under red light (~40 µmol photons m-2 sec-1) for 30-60 min. Note: This step makes cells swim actively (Sineshchekov et al., 2000). In addition, red light (λ) does not stimulate channelrhodopsin 1 (ChR1), the main photoreceptor protein for phototaxis, and thus makes cells sensitive to following green-light illumination (Berthold et al., 2008).(For dish assay) Put 2 ml cell suspensions in a Petri dish, place it on a white sheet and take a picture before illumination (Figure 1A).Note: When control data for positive or negative phototaxis are necessary, add final 0.2 mM t-BOOH or 75 mM DMTU to the cell suspensions, respectively. These reagents can be added either to the harvested cell suspensions in a test tube or directly the cell suspensions in a dish. t-BOOH is a kind of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which has similar effects to H2O2, and can be substituted with 25 μM H2O2. DMTU is a H2O2 scavenger, and can be substituted with 50 mM 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (TEMPOL) (Wakabayashi et al., 2011). Another option to derive negative phototaxis control is to use the strain CC-124 (agg1). It is regarded as a ‘wild type’, but its mutation in the agg1 locus causes strong negative phototaxis (Ide et al., 2016).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170616/20170616201042_4475.jpgFigure 1.

    "A 4 cm Petri dish is set on a white plastic sheet. A green LED is set on the side of the dish and fixed. B. During and C. after illumination for 5 min. Positive phototaxis is observed. D. For dish assay, the Petri dish and the LED is covered with a box to block the room light. The inside of the box is masked with pieces of black cloth for antireflection. E. During the dish assay. Before and after 5 min (or longer) illumination, pictures are taken from the top with a camera.Illuminate the dish from one side with green LED and cover the dish and the LED with a box (Figures 1B, 1D and 1E). Leave them for 5 min (or longer). Check the light intensity by a photometer. Typically, wild-type cells show positive phototaxis at low intensity (< 1 μmol photons m-2 sec-1) and negative phototaxis at higher intensity (> 5 μmol photons m-2 sec-1). To change the light intensity, either change the distance from the LED to the dish and/or set ND filters in front of the LED.Note: The action spectra of phototaxis peak at 495 to 505 nm (blue-green light) (Foster et al., 1984). We use green light because blue light activates photosynthesis, which changes cellular redox state as well as the phototactic sign (Takahashi and Watanabe, 1993; Wakabayashi et al., 2011). Take pictures (Figure 1C).Note: Please note that this ‘dish assay’ is not an accurate method for phototaxis assay, because accumulation of cells caused by light illumination (called photo-accumulation) could occur also by the photoshock response, in that cells either stop or swim backward for a short period upon sensing the sudden change in the light intensity. The purpose of this method is a quick test for phototactic capability.",
    "Phototactic movement is defined as the movement along the light beam, which should be examined by the following single-cell analysis.(For the single-cell analysis) Place a Petri dish on the stage of an inverted microscope and illuminate it with a green LED from the side (Figure 2). Observe the cells in the area near the light source (to estimate the light intensity when necessary) with dim red light (λ > 600 nm, ~5 μmol photons m-2 sec-1) and video-record using a CCD camera.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170616/20170616201254_9632.jpgFigure 2.
