    "1. Identification of Homology Regions Around the Desired Deletion\nNOTE: Only necessary if using selection-based editing.\nSelect two regions, initially 1.5-2 kb, on either side of the desired deletion locus, which will serve as homology arms in the HDR template (Figure 1A). Identify regions that lack BsaI recognition sites on either strand (GGTCTC) to facilitate cloning. If BsaI sites are unavoidable, use an alternate type IIs restriction enzyme (BsmBI, SapI, BbsI) and modify the corresponding sites in the recipient plasmid (pUC19-BsaI), resistance marker donor plasmid (pGolden-Neo or pGolden-Hygro), and homology arm PCR product overhangs.\n2. Generation of Cas9-sgRNA Expression Plasmids\nDefine the targeting site(s) for mutagenesis. For the single-cut, selection-free method, target 5' proximal coding exons to increase the probability of a non-functional mutation. For the two-cut method, select two sites that span as much of the gene as necessary.\n\tNOTE: In our experience, deletions up to 53 kb are efficiently created.\nInput 200 to 300 bp of the targeted region sequence into the crispr.mit.edu design tool. For selection-based cloning, use 200-300 bp of the identified homology regions that are proximal to the deletion locus (Figure 1A). Select 2-3 of the highest-ranked sgRNAs per targeted region to account for differences in their activity, and to isolate independent clones that do not share the same potential off-target effects.\nTo design duplexed oligonucleotides with appropriate overhangs for insertion into the expression plasmid, omit the ending PAM sequence (NGG) and append a 5'-CACC overhang followed by a G to the top strand oligo. For the bottom strand oligo, append a 5'-AAAC overhang to the reverse-complemented target sequence, followed by a 3'-C, as illustrated below:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55903/55903seq01.jpg\nInsert synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to the sgRNAs into the pSpCas9(BB) plasmid using Golden Gate cloning28 as described in the Zhang lab protocol29.",
    "3. Generation of Homology-directed Repair Template Plasmids\nNOTE: Only necessary if using selection-based editing. The homology-directed repair template plasmid consists of a drug resistance cassette flanked by two regions that are complementary to the genome just outside the two sgRNA target sites (Figure 1B).\nFrom the broader homology regions identified in step 1.1, select 800-1,000 bp26 no more than 5-10 bp away from the designed Cas9 cut sites, to serve as the homology arms (Figure 1A). Be sure not to include the sgRNA target site and its PAM in the homology arms, as this will cause CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage of the template plasmid itself. If the homology arms do contain internal BsaI sites, use alternate sgRNA sites.\nPCR amplify homology arms from genomic DNA using a high-fidelity DNA polymerase, per manufacturer's instructions, using forward and reverse primers with additional 5' sequence that introduces BsaI sites (GGTCTC) and unique overhangs on either end of the homology region. The overhangs must contain proper sequences to generate correct assembly order and orientation, as described below (Figure 1B):\n\tLeft homology arm FP overhang: 5' GGGTCTCAGGCC\n\tLeft homology arm RP overhang: 5' GGGTCTCTCACG\n\tRight homology arm FP overhang: 5' GGGTCTCAGTCC\n\tRight homology arm RP overhang: 5' GGGTCTCTCCAC\nCheck homology arms for appropriate amplification via gel electrophoresis before proceeding forward.\nAssemble the right and left homology arm regions with the resistance cassette into an HDR template plasmid by Golden Gate cloning28. Use pGolden-Neo or pGolden-Hygro plasmids30 as the source of loxP-flanked resistance cassettes (loxP-PGK-Neo-pA-loxP or loxP-PGK-Hyg-pA-loxP). Use pUC19-BsaI, a modified pUC19 with BsaI sites in the multiple cloning region and eliminated BsaI sites elsewhere, as the recipient vector (available upon request). Use a ratio of 1:1:1:1 for the three inserts and vector.\nPrepare the following reaction mixture30:\n\t\ttable:\n﻿0,1\nRight homology arm PCR product,0.06 pmol (30-40ng)",

Repeat for 30 cycles.\nTreat the cloning product with an exonuclease per manufacturer's instructions to digest away any remaining linearized DNA.\nTransform the reaction mixture into a competent E. coli strain according to the protocol supplied with the cells, and plate on ampicillin-containing dishes.\nTo identify clones with the correct template assembly, perform bacterial colony PCR to amplify the homology arm subregions of the assembled insert (as the whole insert may be too large to amplify reliably). Use one primer annealing to the flanking plasmid sequence and a second primer complementary to the edge of the resistance cassette (Figure 1B, the sequence is common to both Neo and Hygro inserts), generating an assembly-dependent product that is approximately 200 bp longer than the contained homology arm:\n\tpUC19-Bsal-Left: 5' GGCTCGTATGTTGTGTGGAATTGTGAG\n\tResistance-Left: 5' AAAAGCGCCTCCCCTACCC\n\tpUC19-BsaI-Right: 5' GCTATTACGCCAGCTGGCGAAA\n\tResistance-Right: 5' AAGACAATAGCAGGCATGCTGGG\n\t\nPick bacterial colonies with sterile toothpicks and suspend the bacteria in 20 µL water. Heat at 95 °C for 15 min, and spin down in a tabletop centrifuge at maximal speed for 5 min. Place immediately on ice.\nPrepare the following PCR mixture31:\n\t\ttable:\n﻿0,1\nDilute colony template,1.25 µL\n10x Taq reaction buffer,1.25 µL\n20mM dNTPs,0.25 µL\n10 µM Forward primer,0.25 µL\n10 µM Reverse primer,0.25 µL\nTaq Polymerase,0.25 µL\nWater,9 µL\nUse the following thermocycler parameters: 95 °C for 30 s, (95 °C 30 s, 61 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min/kb), repeat for 25 cycles, 72 °C for 2 min.",
    "Check PCR product for correct amplicon size by agarose gel electrophoresis.\nOptionally, miniprep plasmid DNA from individual colonies with correct insert size and sequence the homology arm regions by Sanger sequencing with the amplification primers mentioned above.\n4. Transfection of CRISPR Components into Cultured Cells\nPrior to transfection: culture T-REx293 cells in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nPlate cells onto 6-well plates and grow to approximately 70% confluency. Include a well for an untransfected control.\nTransfect cells with 2.5 µg total plasmid using a commercial transfection protocol. In parallel, maintain the untransfected control.\n\tNOTE: Transfection method and efficiency vary depending on cell type. Determine the appropriate transfection method for the system prior to the experiment.\nFor transfection of cells with selection, use 0.75 µg Cas9-sgRNA 1 (left cut), 0.75 µg Cas9-sgRNA 2 (right cut), and 1.0 µg homologous recombination template.\nFor transfection of cells without selection, use 2.5 µg Cas9-sgRNA plasmid.\n5. Drug Selection\n48 h after transfection, treat the cells with the appropriate drug (Neomycin/Hygromycin). Carry out selection until all cells in the untransfected control die (typically 3-5 days for Neo, 7-14 days for Hygro).\n\tNOTE: Use concentrations of 500 µg/mL and 10 µg/mL for Neomycin and Hygromycin, respectively for T-REx293 cells. For other cell types, it may be useful to carry out a prior titration of drug on untransfected cells to determine the effective concentration.\n6. Isolation of Clonal Populations\nGrow cells to 100% confluency in the original well after selection. Seed cells into 96 well plates at a density of 0.33 cells per well.\n\tNOTE: Seeding three 96 well plates is a good starting point to ensure isolation of more than one correct clone, but more or less may be needed depending on sgRNA and HDR efficiencies.",
    "Observe colonies over a 2-4 week period, until colonies are visible to the eye. Pick visible colonies with a sterile pipette tip and reseed in new wells to encourage monolayer growth. When using suspension cells, even lower seeding densities can be used to ensure a greater proportion of single-colony wells.\n7. Screening Candidates\nScreening candidates without the use of selection: dot blot\nGrow individual clones to 50-100% confluency. Dislodge the monolayer of cells by pipetting within the well.\nAliquot 90 µL of the 100 µL total volume to a clean microcentrifuge tube. Spin down at 6000 rpm for 5 min, remove media, and lyse cell pellet in 10 µL of 1x Lysis Buffer or 1x SDS loading buffer (5x: 250 mM Tris-Cl pH 6.8, 8% SDS, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 40% glycerol, 100 mM DTT). Add 90 µL of new media to the remainder of the cells in the well to continue propagating.\nPipette 1 µL of cell lysate onto a dry nitrocellulose membrane to form a dot. Blot each sample twice on two separate membranes, creating two identical patterns of samples.\nBlock the membranes in 5% milk in TBST (Tris Buffered Saline + 0.01% Tween 20: 8 g NaCl, 0.2g KCl, 3 g Tris base, up to 1 L distilled water, pH 7.4)31 for 1 h at room temperature (with rocking, here and throughout the procedure).\nBlot using the primary antibody against the target protein on one membrane, and the primary antibody for a control protein (tubulin, GAPDH, or any other protein that is not expected to change) on the other. Use the recommended primary antibody dilution (0.2 µg/mL for ELAVL1 and 0.1 µg/mL for Pum2 in this case) in TBST + 5% milk. Incubate 1 h at room temperature.\nWash 3 times with TBST for 5 min.",
    "Incubate each membrane with appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody in TBST + 5% milk for 1 h at room temperature.\nWash 3 times with TBST for 5 min.\nApply chemiluminescence substrate solution (see Materials Table) following the manufacturer's instructions and image the blotted membrane on a digital chemiluminescence imager.\nQuantify dot intensities for the target and control proteins using the appropriate software.\nEliminate candidates with low control protein signal, and calculate background-subtracted ratios of target to control protein intensities for the remaining candidates. Select the candidates with the lowest ratios for passage and further validation by western blot.\nScreening candidates with the use of selection: colony PCR\nCollect cell lysate using a DNA prep kit (See Materials Table).\n\t\t\nDuplicate individual colonies in a new 96 well and grow until 100% confluency.\nRemove media from one set of the clones, and resuspend cells in 30 µL of extraction buffer from the kit. Transfer to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nHeat the solution to 96 °C for 15 min and let cool to room temperature.\nAdd 30 µL of Stabilization buffer from the kit. Mix well.\nIdentify wildtype and monoallelic/biallelic mutant lines by colony PCR.\n\t\t\nDesign two separate sets of PCR primers (for the left and right side of the targeted locus) to amplify regions around the homology arms based on either successful or unsuccessful integration of the resistance cassette (Figure 2C). On each side, use a common primer (red) that anneals outside of the homology arm. Use it with a corresponding paired primer that is complementary to the endogenous sequence, spanning the homology region (blue), to test for the wild-type allele. Use another paired primer, complementary to the inserted resistance cassette (see primers in section 2.3), to test for the desired mutation.",
    "(Recommended) Validate the primer sets using cell lysate from the original selected bulk cell population, since it will contain a mixture of both WT and mutant alleles (Figure 2D).\nPrepare the following reaction mixture:\n\t\t\ttable:\n﻿0,1\nCell lysate,0.5 µL\n10x KOD buffer,1.25 µL\n25mM MgSO4,0.75 µL\n2 mM dNTPs,1.25 µL\n10 µM Forward primer,0.375 µL\n10 µM Reverse primer,0.375 µL\nKOD polymerase,0.25 µL\nWater,7.75 µL\nUse the following thermocycler conditions: 95 °C for 2 min, (95 °C for 20 s, Primer Tm for 10 s, 70 °C for 20 s/kb) repeat for 25 cycles.\nVisualize the PCR product by agarose gel electrophoresis.\nRepeat the colony PCR testing for each side of the predicted integration. Select and expand candidates that show presence of integration and no endogenous sequence product for the deleted region.\nValidate positive candidates by western blot and/or RT-qPCR.\n8. Verify the Genomic Mutation by Sequencing\nIsolate genomic DNA from mutant cell lines by phenol chloroform extraction31.\nPCR amplify the sgRNA target region, using primers with 5' overhangs that add BsaI restriction sites to each end.\n\tNOTE: For clones edited with HDR, where both alleles may be identical, the PCR product can be sequenced directly.\nClone the amplified region into pUC19-BsaI by Golden Gate cloning.\nTransform the reaction mixture into a competent E. coli strain.\nMiniprep plasmid DNA from 6-10 individual colonies and sequence the cloned region by Sanger sequencing.\nSubscription Required.
