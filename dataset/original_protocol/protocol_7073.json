GenBank: MN908947 was divided into four fragments designated as A-B, C, D, and E, each obtained by PCR using a chemically synthesized SARS-CoV-2 genome as the template. The fragments were cloned into the pCCI, pMV, or pLVX vectors, resulting in four plasmids: pCCI-A-B, pMV-C, pLVX-D, and pLVX-E.",
    "The SARS-CoV-2 N gene with a Flag tag in the N terminal was cloned into the lentivirus vector pLVX-IRES-mCherry, resulting in pLVX-N-Flag-IRES-mCherry that was then was used to generate lentivirus. Caco-2 cells transduced with this lentivirus (Caco-2-N) serve as the packaging cell line for producing SARs-CoV-2 trVLPs, as the Caco-2-N cells complement the SARS-CoV-2 GFP/ΔN genome by providing N in trans. Meanwhile, N gene was also mutated at 212 amino acid (G212C) and split into two parts. These two parts are fused with intein elements Npu-N and Npu-C (Zettler et al., 2009) separately defining as NN-IntN and IntC-NC and further cloned into lentiviral vectors, resulting pLVX- NN-IntN-IRES-mCherry and pLVX-IntC-NC-IRES-puromycin, respectively. These two plasmids encoding either N- or C-terminal of N protein were transduced together to ligate the full-length N in Caco-2 cell for generating another packaging cell line Caco-2-Nintein.TransformationFor each plasmid, thaw EPI 300 or Stbl3 competent cells on ice (see \"Note\" below) and add 2 μl (approximately 10 ng) of the respective plasmid to the competent cells. Mix by tapping the tube and incubate on ice for 30 min.Note: For pMV- and pLVX-derived plasmids – including pMV-C, pLVX-D, pLVX-E, pLVX-N-Flag-IRES-mCherry, pLVX-NN-IntN-IRES-mCherry, and pLVX-IntC-NC-IRES-puromycin – use Stbl3 competent cells for transformation. For pCCI-derived plasmid pCCI-A-B, EPI300 competent cells for transformation.Heat shocks the tube containing the cells and plasmid mixture in a 42°C water bath for 90 s, then immediately place back on ice for a 2 min incubation.Add 1 ml LB medium to the tube and shake at 37°C for 45 min at 220 rpm using an incubator shaker to recover the cells.After recovery, plate 100 μl of the cell culture onto an LB plate supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (see \"Notes\" below) and incubate overnight at 37°C.",
    "Notes:  For selection of Stbl3 bacteria transformed with pMV- and pLVX-derived plasmids, use LB agar plates supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. For selection of EPI300 bacteria transformed with pCCI-A-B, use LB agar plates supplemented with 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Preparation of plasmids carrying SARS-CoV-2 genesAfter overnight incubation, for each plate, pick 2-3 bacterial colonies and inoculate 4 ml LB supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (the antibiotic concentration remains the same as on the plates). Incubate overnight (12-16 h) at 37°C with shaking at 220 rpm.For pMV- and pLVX-derived plasmids, the overnight culture can directly be used for plasmid preparation. For pCCI-A-B, the bacterial culture should be further induced as follows:Add 1.5 ml of the overnight culture to a 50 ml flask or tube containing 13.5 ml LB supplemented with 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 15 μl of CopyControlTM Induction Solution (Lucigen, catalog number: CCIS125), and shake at 220 rpm for 5 h at 37°C.Centrifuge the cell cultures by spinning at 4,000 × g for 5 min.Discard the supernatant and remove as much residual liquid as possible.Following the manufacturer's instructions, use the cell for plasmid extraction via the Plasmid Mini Kit I (Omega).At the final step of plasmid extraction, add 50 μl deionized water to the mini-prep column and incubate at RT for 3 min, then centrifuge at 13,000 × g for 1 min to elute the plasmids.Determine the concentration and quality of the plasmid prep using a NanoDrop. The plasmids can be used immediately or stored at -20°C until use.Construction of Caco-2-N and Caco-2-Nintein cell linesLentivirus packagingPrepare vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentivirus following this published protocol (Tiscornia et al., 2006). Briefly, use VigoFect DNA transfection reagent to transiently co-transfect HEK293T cells with the third-generation packaging plasmids pMD2G (catalog no. 12259; Addgene), psPAX2 (catalog no.",
    "12260; Addgene), and the transfer vector pLVX-N-Flag-IRES-mCherry. Change the medium 12 h post transfection and collect supernatants at 36, 60, and 84 h post transfection. Pool all the supernatants, pass through a 0.45-μm filter, aliquot, and store at -80°C until needed.TransductionSeed 1 × 105 Caco-2 cells in a 24-well plate one day prior to infection to ensure 70-80% confluent next day.When ready for transduction, remove the cell culture medium, add 1 ml of lentivirus supplemented with 10 μg/ml polybrene into the well, and mix by rocking the plate gently. Incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 48 h.Notes:  To generate the Caco-2-N cell line, lentivirus packaging pLVX-N-Flag-IRES-mCherry is used for transduction. To generate the Caco-2-Nintein cell line, lentivirus packaging pLVX-NN-IntN-IRES-mCherry and pLVX-IntC-NC-IRES-puromycin are mixed (1:1) and used for transduction of the Caco-2 cells. The addition of polybrene increases transduction efficiency. As a measure of transduction efficiency, monitor the mCherry signal daily using a fluorescent microscope. Generally, the mCherry signal can be readily detected at 48 h post infection.At 48 h post transduction, check the mCherry signal and passage the transduced cells into a 6-well plate and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2.At another 24 h, check the mCherry signal and cell density to make sure at least 90% of cells are mCherry positive, harvesting cells that could be used as the packing cell line for production of trVLPs.Note: Since these cells are not under selection, the N gene in these Caco-2-derived cell lines can be lost after several passages, which will decrease the packaging efficiency of trVLPs. Thus, re-transduce the Caco-2-N cell lines as needed to maintain the N gene expression level.",
    "Alternatively, use a cell sorter to harvest the first 30% of the mCherry-positive cells from the constructed Caco-2-N cell lines if the N expression level is not sufficient (the mCherry positive cells lower than 90%) for trVLP packaging.

Mix by vortexing for 5 s and remove 12 μl to add to another aliquot of 108 μl DMEM with 10% FBS (1:100 dilution). Repeat the dilution series out to a 108-fold dilution.Add 100 μl of the diluted virions to each well of the seeded Caco-2-N cells in the 96-well plate on top of the existing media (to make a total of 200 μl per well), with eight replicates per dilution. Gently rock the plate to mix the virions well and incubate at 37°C, 5% CO2.Check the GFP signal of each well 24 h post infection and count the number of GFP-positive wells for each concentration.Calculate theTCID50 following the Reed & Muench method (Reed and Muench, 1938) using the equations described below:TCID50/ml = (1 (ml)/the volume of original trVLPs (ml)) ×10^ (proportionate distance + Lower dilution).",
    "Proportionate Distance = (Percentage next above 50% - 50%)/(Percentage next above 50% - Percentage next below 50%).Lower dilution= 10^ (dilution in which position is next above 50%)."
