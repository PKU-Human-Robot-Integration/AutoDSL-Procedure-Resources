Usually, CPE is observed within 2–4 days post-inoculation.\nAfter ∼80%–90% CPE is observed in the infected wells, collect viral supernatants and discard cells.\nCentrifuge viral supernatants at ∼500 × g and 4°C for 10 min to remove any cell debris.\nMake aliquots.\nPause point: Viral supernatants can be stored at −80°C until use.\nPlaque purification of SARS-CoV-2 isolates\nTiming: 4 days\nThis step describes how to obtain a clonal viral population from the potential viral quasispecies present in the nasopharyngeal swab and from those that may emerge in cell culture during virus isolation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1793-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic representation of “Plaque purification of SARS-CoV-2 isolates” step\nPerform ten-fold serial dilutions in infection media with the SARS-CoV-2 isolate collected in the step before.\nRemove the growth media of a 12 well-plate seeded with Vero-TMPRSS2 cells described in step #3 of ‘before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]’ section.\nInoculate 200 μL of the viral dilutions previously prepared onto the confluent Vero-TMPRSS2 monolayer.\nMove plate to incubator and maintain at 37°C in 5% CO2.",
    "Note: In this step, we do not include undiluted virus. However, it can be used if viral titer is believed to be low.\nCritical: Rock plates manually every 15 min to ensure an even distribution of the virus in the wells.\nAfter 1 h adsorption, discard viral supernatants properly.\nAdd 1 mL of overlay media per well and incubate at 37°C for 3 days. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nNote: Overlay media should be at ∼37°C–40°C temperature to not damage the Vero cells monolayer.\nAfter three days of incubation, select and mark the viral plaques in the bottom of the plate.\nNote: After three days, plaques should be visible by naked eye. Mark multiple plaques (∼3–6) from different wells. Select wells corresponding to viral dilutions where plaques are isolated and not contiguous to other plaques to ensure clonal viral populations.\nRemove the growth media of a new 6 well-plate seeded with Vero-TMPRSS2 cells described in step #3 of ‘before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]’ section and add 2 mL of infection media per well.\nUsing a 200 μL pipette, pick the selected plaques (∼3–6) by going through the agar with the edge of the tip and touching the selected individual plaque.\nTransfer and resuspend the tip to one of the wells of the 6 well-plate containing infection media.\nMove plate to incubator and maintain at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nCritical: Include an uninfected control well in the 6 well-plate to monitor for any non-viral induced effects on the cells.\nMonitor cells for potential CPE up to a week.\nAfter CPE is observed in ∼90% of the cells, collect viral supernatants and discard cells properly.\nCentrifuge viral supernatants at ∼500 × g and 4°C for 10 min to remove any cell debris.\nPause point: Viral supernatants can be stored at −80°C until use.\nGeneration of viral stock",
    "Timing: 3 days\nThis step allows amplification of the clonal viral population to ensure reproducibility in the following experiments.\nInoculate 100 μL of plaque-purified SARS-CoV-2 isolate onto a confluent 175 cm2 (∼ 25 × 106 cells) flask of Vero-TMPRSS2 cells.\nMaintain cells in 20 mL of infection media at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nAfter 48–60 h post-infection (when ∼80%–90% CPE is observed), collect cell supernatant in falcon tubes and centrifuge for 10 min at 4°C and at ∼500 × g. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3].\nMake aliquots of 300 μL in cryovials and store at −80°C until use.\nSequence viral stocks generated from plaque purification. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5].\nPause point: Viral supernatants can be stored at −80°C until use.\nCritical: The sequence from the viral stock should be compared with that of the clinical samples generated in previous steps. Therefore, next-generation sequencing should be performed upon collection of nasal swab sample and after generation of viral stock. This is a quality control assay to make sure no mutations take place during amplification of the virus in Vero-TMPRSS2.

Duplicates of each sample should be performed to obtain an accurate titer.",
    "Critical: Rock plates manually every 15 min to ensure an even distribution of the virus in the wells.\nAfter 1 h adsorption, remove viral supernatants and discard properly.\nAdd 1 mL of overlay media per well and incubate at 37°C for 3 days. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1].\nCritical: Overlay media needs to be heated until a transparent homogeneous suspension is observed. Excessive heating may result in cell death.\nAfter 3 days, fix plates by directly adding 1 mL of 10% formaldehyde per well for 1 h.\nCritical: Fixation with 10% formaldehyde is required for inactivation of potential SARS-CoV-2 virus. Decontaminate plates before bringing them out of the BSL-3 facility. The next step in the protocol can be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory.\nImmunostaining\nTiming: 24 h\nThis step is required to detect infectious virus using specific antibodies and visualize viral plaques for counting and assessment of viral titer.\nAppropriately, discard 10% formaldehyde in the fume hood.\nCarefully, remove the overlay from the wells using a spatula.\nBlock the plates for 1 h with shaking using 250 μL of blocking solution per well.\nAfter 1 h, remove the blocking solution and add 250 μL per well of mouse anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP antibody (1C7C7) at a dilution of 1:1000 in 1% milk-TBST and incubate for 1 h with shaking and at RT.\nWash cells twice with 1× PBS.\nAdd 250 μL per well of goat anti-mouse secondary IgG-HRP antibody at a dilution of 1:5000 in 1% milk-TBST and incubate for 1 h in shaking and at RT.\nWash cells twice with 1× PBS.\nDevelop plaques by adding 200 μL of TrueBlue substrate for 15 min in shaking and RT (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1793-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Plaque assay analysis and visualization of plaques by immunostaining",
    "In this example, 24 and 25 plaques were counted in the 104 dilution for replicates Sample 1 and 2. Following the formula from above: (24.5/10−4)∗(1/0.2) = 1.23 × 106 pfu/mL.\nWash plates with water and count plaques.\nNote: Count the wells with 10–100 plaques. To determine the viral titer of the initial viral stock (pfu/mL): (average number of plaques/10-x dilution) ∗(1 mL/volume used to inoculate dilution (in mL) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). We used 1C7C7 antibody for staining, but another anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody can be used.\nPause point: Once the viral titer is determined, the next steps in the protocol can be planned according to schedule.\nInfection of Vero-TMPRSS2 cells with SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates\nTiming: 48 h\nThis step is required to analyze the efficiency in spike protein cleavage of different SARS-CoV-2 variants in the context of in vitro infection and the role and usage of TMPRSS2 proteases by the different viruses.\nRemove the growth media of the 12 well-plate seeded with Vero-TMPRSS2 cells described in step #3 of ‘before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]’ section and add 1 mL/well of infection media.\nInfect cells with the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 isolate at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01.\nNote: The MOI is the ratio between number of viral particles and infected cells while PFU is a measurement of the quantity of viruses capable of lysing host cells to form a plaque. Therefore, for an MOI of 1, each cell should be infected with one viral particle. In contrast, 1 pfu/mL indicates that 1 mL of the viral preparation will produce a single plaque in a cell monolayer. Since our viral stock is at 1.23 × 106 pfu/mL (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), and in this case, we need 3200 pfu/well, we will use 2.6 μL/well of the viral stock.",
    "Incubate cells with the virus for 1 h and then, wash them twice with PBS to ensure removal of non-attached virus.\nDiscard the supernatant properly.\nAfter infection, maintain the cells in 1 mL/well of infection media until sample collection.\nCritical: Infections with SARS-CoV-2 viral isolates need to be performed in a BSL-3 facility following biosafety guidelines.\nSample collection and lysis\nTiming: 1 h\nViral supernatants are collected from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and lysis buffer is added for subsequent antibody detection of viral proteins.\nCritical: This step is performed in a BSL-3 facility following biosafety guidelines.\nNote: Prepare fresh lysis buffer before use.\nCollect ∼1 mL of viral supernatants from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells in an Eppendorf tube after 48 h of infection.

The next steps in the protocol can be performed in a BSL-2 laboratory.\nBoil samples for 10 min at 100°C.\nCentrifuge samples for 10 min at 4°C and ∼20,000 × g.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at -20°C until use.\nSDS-PAGE protein electrophoresis\nTiming: 3 h\nSDS-PAGE protein electrophoresis allows separation of proteins by their molecular weight. In this step, we are interested in separating the cleaved and uncleaved spike proteins together with SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein for subsequent detection by specific antibodies. The nucleocapsid is used as virus loading control of the viruses tested.\nCritical: To avoid protein degradation, viral supernatants must be on ice during the preparation of samples for SDS-PAGE.\nMix samples with 5× loading buffer to a final concentration of 1×.",
    "Boil samples for 10 min at 100°C.\nLoad 15 μL of each sample in a precast 10% TGX gels (15 wells).

Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9].\nWash membranes with TBST for 10 min in shaking and RT. Repeat three times.\nIncubate membranes with secondary anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody diluted 1:5000 in 3% milk TBST for 1 h at RT.\nWash membranes with TBST for 10 min in shaking and RT. Repeat three times.\nDevelop membranes using chemiluminescent substrate.\nNote: To achieve best resolution, use SuperSignal™ West Pico PLUS Chemiluminescent Substrate or similar.\nAntibody detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein\nTiming: 1 day\nSARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (50 kDa) protein is detected using a specific rabbit antibody. Detection of nucleocapsid protein is used as loading control and required for subsequent sample normalization.\nNote: No stripping buffer is needed. Specific detection is achieved by using antibodies from different animal hosts to detect SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein.",
