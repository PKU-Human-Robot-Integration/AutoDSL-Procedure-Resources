(1996)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4].\nCOS-7 cell transfections\nTiming: 4 days\nIn this section mammalian cells are transfected with constructs encoding the protein of interest to drive transient overexpression so that the proteins can be harvested in the next section.\nThe cDNA encoding the ZBTB7A ZFs were previously cloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression plasmid and contained an N-terminal FLAG tag (Martyn et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Yang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). pcDNA3-FLAG-ZBTB7A ZF plasmid constructs were transiently overexpressed in COS-7 cells. After 48 h, cells were harvested and nuclear extracts (NXT) prepared for subsequent EMSA experiments.\nThe nuclear extraction protocol is optimized for approximately 106 COS-7 cells. A pcDNA3 ‘empty’ construct that did not contain the ZBTB7A ZF region or FLAG tag was also transfected to act as a negative control.\nGrow COS-7 cells in 10 cm tissue culture plates at 37°C in a 5% CO2 water jacketed incubator prior to transfection.\nCells are cultured using Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin-glutamate (PSG).\nDuring passaging, incubate COS-7 adherent cells with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA for 5 min at 37°C to dislodge the cells.\nSeed COS-7 cells in 10 cm tissue culture plates approximately 24 h prior to transfection to ensure plates are at approximately 50%–60% confluency on the day of transfection.\nThis allows enough live cells to take up the ZBTB7A ZF plasmids, as well as the desired conditions for the live/transfected cells to divide and ensure growth is not impeded by dead cells.",
    "On the day of transfection (day 1), warm DMEM (supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% PSG) and Opti-MEM (no FCS, no PSG) to 37°C for about 15 min before transfecting.\nIn a PC2 biosafety cabinet, add 5 μL of 1 mg/mL pcDNA3 ‘empty’ plasmid construct (5 μg total) into a new labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Repeat this step for all ZBTB7A ZF constructs to be transfected.\nTo a new set of 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, add 85 μL Opti-MEM and 15 μL FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent per transfection.\nIncubate the FuGENE6/Opti-MEM at room temperature (RT) for 5 min.\nPipette the FuGENE 6/Opti-MEM in one tube into the labeled tube containing 5 μg of plasmid drop-wise (make sure the FuGENE 6/Opti-MEM solution falls directly on top of the plasmid solution and does not adhere to the sides of the tube).\nIncubate the FuGENE 6/Opti-MEM/plasmid mixtures at RT for 15 min.\nDuring the 15 min incubation, replate the media on the COS-7 transfection plates with 10 mL of new, warmed DMEM media (supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% PSG).\nLabel plates with the name of plasmid construct to be used. Leave COS-7 cells in the incubator until ready to add the FuGENE 6/Opti-MEM/plasmid mixture.\nJust before the end of the 15 min incubation, remove the 50%–60% confluent COS-7 plates from the incubator and place them in a PC2 biosafety cabinet.\nAfter the 15 min incubation, add the total volume in the FuGENE 6/Opti-MEM/plasmid tube to the COS-7 plates at RT. Do this dropwise in a spiral pattern to ensure homogeneous distribution of transfection agent across the plate of cells.\nPut the lid back on the plate and gently push the plate forward-and-back and side-to-side to evenly distribute the transfection mixture in the media.",
    "Repeat steps 10 and 11 for any other ZBTB7A ZF plasmids.\nPlace the COS-7 cells back in the incubator to grow at 37°C in 5% CO2 for approximately 48 h.\nCritical: Do not grow the transfected COS-7 cells for more than 72 h as the COS-7 cells will tend to overgrow and die.\nHarvesting COS-7 cell transfections and nuclear extractions\nTiming: 1.5 h\nIn this section the transiently overexpressed proteins are extracted from the COS-7 cells. The nuclear extraction protocol is based on the one described by Andrews and Faller (1991)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2].\nDiscard the DMEM media from the COS-7 transfection plates. The COS-7 cells do not need to be kept sterile from this point onwards.\nAdd 1 mL ice-cold PBS to each plate.\nScrape all the COS-7 cells off the surface of each plate using a cell scraper and transfer the cells and PBS to a new, labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Keep harvested transfected COS-7 cells on ice.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min and remove the supernatant. Proceed to performing nuclear extractions.\nPause point: After removing the supernatant from the harvested cells, freeze cell pellets at −80°C until needed. Cell pellets can be stored at −80°C for up to 3 months.\nCritical: Keep all cell pellets, buffer A and buffer C on ice while performing the nuclear extractions.\nFor each mL of buffer A and buffer C to be used, add 5 μL 0.2 M PMSF (dissolved in isopropanol), 5 μL 1 M DTT, 10 μL 1 mg/mL leupeptin and 10 μL 1 mg/mL aprotinin.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 300–400 μL buffer A and incubate on ice for 10 min. The suggested buffer A volume to use is around 10× the cell pellet size.",
    "Vortex for 10 s, then spin for 10 s in a tabletop mini centrifuge.\nRemove all the supernatant (cytoplasmic extract).\nResuspend the cell pellet in 50–100 μL buffer C and incubate for 20 min on ice. The suggested buffer C volume to use is around 1–2× the cell pellet size for ZBTB7A ZF transfection pellets. If your nuclear pellet is large then add more buffer C to ensure efficient high salt nuclear protein extraction.\nPre-chill a centrifuge to 4°C and pre-chill new labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes on ice during the 20 min incubation.\nCentrifuge samples at 18,407 × g for 3 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the nuclear extract (NXT) supernatant into the pre-chilled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Repeat for all samples. Keep all NXT on ice.\nNote: Determine protein concentration at this point if necessary, e.g., for Western blot, by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm on a spectrophotometer at 280 nm.\nProceed to EMSA sample preparation if DNA probes for EMSAs have already been radio-labeled and purified, and acrylamide gel(s) have been cast.\nPause point: NXTs can be stored at −80°C for up to 1 month. Thaw frozen NXT on ice before use. Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles as this can lead to the NXT proteins degrading.\nPreparation of radiolabeled DNA probes\nTiming: 6 h\nRadiolabeled DNA probes are short complementary, double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that are labeled using ATP [γ-32P]. The 5′ end of the sense (forward) oligonucleotide is labeled with ATP [γ-32P] using T4 PNK enzyme by incubating at 37°C for 30 min then boiling for 1 min at 100°C. The unlabeled antisense (reverse) strand is then added to the labeled forward oligonucleotide and annealed via slow cooling from 100°C to RT.",
    "When annealing radiolabeled complementary oligonucleotides, only the forward strand is labeled, and not both the forward and reverse strands at the same time. T4 PNK kinase is more efficient at phosphorylating single-stranded DNA. Furthermore, background bands may be present in EMSAs due to the presence of radiolabeled single-stranded DNA binding to endogenous proteins. Addition of excess unlabeled reverse strand drives annealing efficiency to produce double-stranded DNA and ensure there will be very little single-stranded DNA to bind to endogenous proteins.\nImportant: The efficiency of radiolabeling probes is dependent on the residue occupying the 5′ end of the forward oligonucleotide. Avoid designing forward probes that begin with a 5′ cytosine residue. Forward oligonucleotides that start with a cytosine are labeled 4-fold less efficiently than oligonucleotides starting with adenine or thymine, and 6-fold less efficiently than oligonucleotides beginning with a guanine.\nDilute the wild-type (WT) -200γ and mutant -200γ forward and reverse DNA oligonucleotides (oligos) to a final concentration of 15 μM by adding 15 μL 100 μM oligo stock and 85 μL Milli-Q water in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube to a total volume of 100 μL. The diluted 15 μM stocks can be stored at −20°C.\nSet up and label one new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube for each forward and reverse oligo.\nAdd 1 μL of 15 μM forward oligo to the new 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube (the ‘forward’ tube), ensuring the liquid is at the very bottom of the tube.\nTo the other tube (the ‘reverse’ tube), add 32.3 μL Milli-Q water, 4 μL 10× TNE buffer and 3.7 μL of 15 μM reverse oligo.\nMake an ‘n+1’ master mix to radiolabel the forward oligo. ‘n’ is the number of probes to be labeled.",
    "For each forward oligo to be radiolabeled add 6 μL Milli-Q water, 1 μL PNK buffer and 1 μL T4 PNK enzyme (10,000 units/mL) into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nThe tube containing the master mix can be placed into a portable cold cooling block or a container with ice to keep the T4 PNK enzyme cold.\nCritical: Perform the next steps in a certified radiation facility. Additional PPE such as laboratory-grade safety glasses, lab coats and disposable gloves must be worn. Equipment and reagents such as Geiger Counters, Decon 90, Perspex containers that can hold 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and a Perspex container double-lined with bin liners for radioactive waste are required.\nNote: The use of long forceps is encouraged to transfer tubes containing 32P as this decreases radiation exposure by increasing the distance between your body and the radiation. Wearing two layers of gloves is also encouraged when handling 32P in case of radioactive contamination on the outer gloves and/or breakage of the outer layer of gloves.\nSet a heat block to 37°C.\nPlace the forward oligo master mix into a Perspex box that can hold 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes and open the tube lid carefully.\nAdd ‘n+1’ volume of 1 μL ATP [γ-32P] (250 μCi) to the forward oligo master mix.\nDispose of the pipette tip and all other radioactively-contaminated materials into the double-lined Perspex waste container.\nClose the tube lid firmly, spin the tube quickly in the tabletop mini centrifuge to ensure all liquid is at the bottom of the tube and transfer it back to the Perspex tube container.\nLine up all forward probe tubes containing 1 μL of 15 uM forward oligo into the Perspex tube container and open the lids.",
    "Aliquot 9 μL of the forward probe master mix into each of the forward oligo tubes. Use a new pipette tip for each tube. Dispose the remaining master mix.\nClose all lids firmly, spin quickly in the tabletop mini centrifuge and carefully transfer tubes back to the Perspex container.\nIncubate forward oligos for 30 min at 37°C in the heat block. Place 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube cap locks on the lids to prevent lids from opening in the next step.\nNote: Use a Perspex shield or place an upside-down open Perspex container on top of the heat block to shield from any radioactivity.\nAfter 30 min has elapsed, set the heat block to 100°C whilst the tubes remain in the heat block.\nBoil the forward probes for 1 min at 100°C. It will take around 10–15 min to heat up to 100°C.\nCarefully remove the cap locks, immediately pressing firmly on the tube lids to ensure they remain closed. Transfer the tubes to the Perspex tube container. Leave the heat block on at 100°C.\nSpin all forward oligo tubes in the tabletop mini centrifuge for at least 10 s to ensure no 32P is on the inner tube lid.\nKeeping the tube in the Perspex tube container, carefully open the forward oligo tube. Check for radiation contamination on fingers and thumb using a Geiger counter. Remove and change gloves if contamination occurs.\nAdd 40 μL of the reverse oligo mixture into the corresponding forward oligo tube and close the lid. Spin tubes in the tabletop mini centrifuge and transfer back to the Perspex box.",
    "Place tubes back in the heat block, put tube cap locks on the lids and set the temperature of the heat block to room temperature (20°C–25°C). Leave tubes to cool down to room temperature (around 4–6 h) to allow radiolabeled forward oligo and reverse oligo to anneal (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1872-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Procedure for performing electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a radiolabeled DNA probe to analyze ZBTB7A ZF-DNA binding\nThe experimental steps include DNA probe labeling with ATP [γ-32P], probe purification, the preparation of a 6% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel, EMSA sample preparation and loading, gel drying and gel imaging.\nPause point: Tubes can be left overnight (∼ 12–16 h) to cool and probes can be purified the following day.\nProbe purification\nTiming: 2 h\nIn this section the radiolabelled probes are purified prior to mixing them with the proteins of interest to assess binding.\nGather Quick Spin Columns for radiolabeled DNA purification (Sephadex G-25 columns, Sigma-Aldrich company) (stored at 4°C) to purify the radiolabeled probes. For each probe you will need two collection tubes, one lid, one column and two 15 mL conical tubes (conical tubes not included in the Sephadex G-25 column kit) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nShake or vortex the columns to break up the material inside to ensure even distribution.\nOpen the top of the column then remove the bottom. Place bottom of the column into a collection tube and place the column and collection tube into the 15 mL conical tube. Repeat for all columns.\nLabel the remaining collection tubes with the probe names.\nCentrifuge the 15 mL conical tubes at 1,100 × g for 1.5 min to collect the liquid from the column in the collection tube.",
    "Open the lid of the 15 mL conical tube and use tweezers to remove the column then the collection tube. Discard the liquid in the collection tube. Reassemble the collection tube, column and 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the 15 mL conical tube again for 1,100 × g for 1.5 min.\nInsert the dried column into the new, labeled collection tube and place the dry column/collection tube into a new 15 mL conical tube.\nNote: The powder in the column should appear dry and chalky after the second spin. If it still appears moist, centrifuge again to remove all residual liquid.\nSpin cooled radiolabeled probes in tabletop mini centrifuge to collect liquid at the bottom of the tube.\nOpen the lid of the 15 mL conical tube and transfer the entire radiolabeled probe (50 μL) onto the top of the column. Ensure you do not touch any other part of the column set up with the pipette tip.\nPlace the conical tube lid back on and centrifuge at 1,100 × g for 4 min.\nDuring the spin, place the column lids on the Perspex tube container by aligning the ring of the collection tube lid with the opening of the Perspex box tube hole (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nUse long forceps to carefully remove and discard the dried column.\nUse long forceps to carefully transfer the collection tube containing the purified probe into the ring (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Press the collection tube firmly down into the ring, close the lid and place purified probes in at 4°C. Check the forceps for any radioactive contamination between transferring each probe.\nPause point: Proceed immediately to non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel set up or continue another day. 32P has a half-life of 14.3 days.\nPreparation of 6% polyacrylamide gel\nTiming: 1 h",
    "In this section a native polyacrylamide gel is poured so that it can be used to load and separate probe-protein complexes in later sections.\nClean two glass plates (18 × 16 cm) with absolute ethanol.\nPlace two spacers (1.5 mm thickness, 2 cm width, 16 cm height) at either end of one of the glass plates. Place the second glass plate over on top, ensuring plates are flush with the spacers.\nScrew on clamp assemblies (16 cm) at either end of the two glass plates where the spacers are inserted.\nPlace the set up into the casting stand opposite the lower buffer chamber, and secure with clips. When inserting and turning the clips, there should be increasing resistance as the glass plates and clamp assemblies are locked into the casting stand.\nPrepare the acrylamide gel (6%) by adding the following reagents, in order, to a 50 mL conical tube:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1872_8.csv\nNote: Add 25% APS and TEMED immediately before pouring the gel. Close the lid of the 50 mL conical tube and invert to mix (do not resuspend with a graduated pipette in case of spillage). If casting more than one gel, prepare each gel individually so the acrylamide does not polymerize in the tube once the APS and TEMED are added. Proceed with caution when handling acrylamide as it may cause nerve damage in humans. Always wear PPE such as a lab coat, safety glasses and two layers of gloves when handling acrylamide. Wash skin thoroughly if contact occurs with skin.",
    "Using a graduated pipette, pour the acrylamide solution immediately into the gel casting cassette (between the two glass plates, and add a 12-well comb between the glass plates (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]). Ensure there are no bubbles on the base of the comb or in the gel.\nMark the comb position and number each lane with a marker.\nWhen the acrylamide has polymerized, transfer the gel apparatus to a 4°C fridge to chill for 30–40 min.\nPrepare 0.5× TBE buffer by adding 25 mL 10× TBE and 475 mL Milli-Q water. 500 mL 0.5× TBE is required per EMSA. Place buffer at 4°C.\nNote: Proceed to preparing EMSA master mix while gels are polymerizing.\nEMSA sample preparation and gel loading\nTiming: 20–30 min\nIn this section the proteins of interest (nuclear extracts) and the radiolabelled probes are combined and then loaded onto the native polyacrylamide gel for separation.\nPlace a cooling block on ice and prepare one labeled 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes for each sample to run on the EMSA.\nPrepare EMSA sample mix as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1872_9.csv\nImportant: Keep all NXT and gel shift sample mixes on ice.\nNote: NXT and Milli-Q water amount can be varied accordingly to the NXT concentration. If the same NXT is used for multiple samples, prepare a ‘n+1’ master mix in a 1.5 mL tube (where ‘n’ is the number of samples) and aliquot 29 μL into each tube.",
    "Optional: An additional sample that has an antibody that binds to the protein of interest, such as an anti-FLAG antibody, can be used to confirm the identity of the protein of interest bound to the probe. This is referred to as a ‘supershift’ as addition of antibody to the sample retards the protein:probe complex in the polyacrylamide gel. Generally, 1 μL of crude antisera or commercially available antibody is added to the supershift sample in addition to the components above (although different amounts can be tested). The antibody may be added during the EMSA sample preparation (before addition of radiolabeled probe) or after the addition of the radiolabeled probe.\nNote: Addition of the antibody before the radiolabeled probe may interfere with binding of the protein of interest to the probe, addition after is more likely to lead to a ‘supershift’.\nRemove radiolabeled probes from the 4°C fridge and spin them down in the tabletop mini centrifuge for at least 10 s.\nAdd 1 μL of desired probe to each of the EMSA samples. Spin EMSA samples in the tabletop mini centrifuge.\nPlace the samples back on the cooling block and incubate at 4°C for 10 min. This allows binding of probe to the protein of interest.\nDuring the 10 min incubation, remove the acrylamide gel from the fridge.\nRemove the clips holding the gel in place in the casting stand and transfer the gel set up to the lower buffer chamber.\nFill bottom chamber with 250 mL 0.5× TBE, remove the comb and flush out the wells using a syringe fixed with a blunt needle. Repeat for all gels. Place gels (with 0.5× TBE in the lower buffer chamber) back at 4°C. When ready to load the samples, remove the gels (in the gel tanks) from the fridge.",
    "Spin EMSA samples in the tabletop mini centrifuge and load samples (∼30 μL) into the wells of the acrylamide gel.\nNote: If there are surplus lanes in the gel, 10–20 μL 6× DNA loading dye can be added to observe migration during electrophoresis.\nPlace the upper buffer chamber on top of the gel and secure with clips. There should be increasing resistance when tightening the clips.\nPour 250 mL 0.5× TBE in the upper buffer chamber and place the safety lid with electrodes over the entire apparatus (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nCarefully transfer complete gel apparatus to the 4°C fridge, plug the electrodes into a power pack and run gel for 1 h 45 min at 250 V at 4°C.\nCheck that the gel is running after 1–2 min.\nEnsure you have at least 1 sheet of thick (1 mm) filter paper per gel. Two pieces of thinner filter paper can be used instead if thicker filter paper is not available.\nTurn on the gel dryer about 10 min before gel electrophoresis is due to finish. Set the temperature to 80°C and allow it to heat up. Ensure the vacuum pump is working.\nNote: The electrophoresis duration described here is based on using probes that are 23 bp in length. If using shorter probes, run electrophoresis for a shorter time to ensure the probe does not migrate off the gel. Similarly, if using longer probes, run electrophoresis for a longer duration to allow better separation of bands. This may require some trial-and-error when performing this for the first time. Alternatively, the percentage of polyacrylamide in gel may be changed, or agarose gels may be used instead of polyacrylamide gels.\nGel drying\nTiming: 45 min",
    "In this section the native polyacrylamide gel is dried so that it can be imaged and the protein-probe complexes visualized in the next section.\nOnce electrophoresis is complete, remove the gel tank from the fridge. Remove the safety lid, upper buffer chamber and lower buffer chamber. Discard the TBE liquid waste into the appropriate waste.\nUse a plate separation tool to slide out one of the spacers and slowly open the glass plates, lifting one plate off from the gel. Ensure the gel remains flat on one glass plate and does not shift or fold back on itself.\nPlace a piece of filter paper over the gel, pat down and lift the paper up (or flip the filter paper and glass plate over) to peel the gel off. The gel should be attached to the filter paper.\nIf using thinner paper, place one more piece of filter paper behind the first piece of filter paper.\nMark the position of lane 1 on the filter paper using a pencil/pen.\nPlace cling film over the surface of the gel. Do not wrap the cling film underneath the filter paper or it will interfere with the drying process.\nPlace the gel on the gel dryer with the filter paper on the bottom and cover the gel(s) with the gel dryer plastic cover. Turn on the vacuum pump and ensure the plastic cover of the gel dryer forms a suction seal around the perimeter of the gel dryer surface. If not, turn off the gel dryer, readjust the dryer surface and gels and try again.\nDry gel for 30 min for one gel or 45 min for two or more gels. The gels should appear very flat and shiny after drying. If not completely dry, continue drying for another 10–20 min.",
    "“Blank” one phosphor screen per gel by placing it under white light for 30 min. Ensure the phosphor screen fits into the gel cassette.\nWhen gels are completely dry, place the gel (now stuck to the filter paper) and the cling film into a gel cassette.\nPlace the white side of the phosphor screen onto the gel and close the cassette. Avoid shifting the phosphor screen on the gel.\nLeave gels overnight (12 h–24 h) on a stationary surface.\nNote: Phosphor screens can be imaged after 2 h, however the image quality will improve with longer exposure times.\nGel imaging\nTiming: 30 min\nIn this section the gels are imaged so that the degree of binding of the protein to the radiolabelled probes can be determined.\nTurn on phosphor imager.\nOpen cassette and transfer black side (magnetic side) of the phosphor screen onto the screen holder. Take note of the coordinates where you placed the phosphor screen on the screen holder.\nNote: If imaging multiple phosphor screens, phosphor screen can be imaged individually or all together on the same screen holder.\nPlace screen holder into the phosphor imager and close the phosphor imager lid.\nOpen the phosphor imaging software:\nName your file (and pre-save it if necessary).\nSet the coordinates for where the phorphor imager should scan the screen holder.\nSet the filter to IP.\nSet pixel size to 100 μM and PMT voltage to 700 V.\nScan the phosphor screen and perform subsequent image manipulation on software such as ImageJ or ImageLab (see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5], 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7], and 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nCrystallographic analysis\nPreparation for the expression plasmid and strain for ZBTB7A\nTiming: 3–4 days\nIn this section the process of generating the expression plasmid encoding the protein of interest by cloning is described.",
    "Amplify the C2H2 zinc finger coding region of human ZBTB7A (NCBI Reference Sequence: NP_001304919.1; residues 382–506) with an additional tryptophan (W) at the end of the C-terminus by PCR from human bone marrow cDNA library (BD Clontech). Digest the PCR product with the restriction enzymes NdeI and XhoI. Clone the digested product into a modified pGEX-4T1 vector (GE Healthcare) that contains a TEV protease cleavage site (amino acid sequence: ENLYFQG) after the GST tag (pGEX-4T1-TEV). The sequences of primers used are listed in key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table].\nNote: The concentration of proteins is usually determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. However, the extinction coefficient of ZF1-4 of ZBTB7A is 0.442 M-1 cm-1, which is difficult to determine the precise concentration of. Addition of a W at the C-terminus end increases the extinction coefficient of ZBTB7A ZF1-4 to 0.802 M-1 cm-1, which is high enough to determine the concentration for. Moreover, further crystallography experiments demonstrated that the extra W has no influence in crystallization and DNA binding.\nThe reaction mixture for PCR amplification of the target gene fragment is indicated below.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1872_10.csv\nNote: The primers are synthesized in powder form.

For example, the length and the ends of DNA should be considered (Patel et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). The DNA sequence should contain the core interacting base pairs 5′-CCCCTTCCCC-3′ (or 3′-GGGGAAGGGG-5′ on the complementary strand) identified by Martyn et al. (2018)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]. We started with a 13+1 base pair double-stranded oligonucleotides (listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), plus a 5′-overhanging guanine or cytosine on the complementary strand. This design was lengthened by 1 bp each time until crystallization was achieved. In the end, only the 17+1 bp oligo yielded high diffraction quality crystals.",
    "Critical: The 17+1 bp oligo contains adenine at -194 position instead of cytosine. The rationale is that the -194 position is just outside of the known human mutations occurring at the -200 site with all of them resulting in reduced DNA binding (Martyn et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). Additionally, ITC measurement revealed nearly identical dissociation constants between wild-type (C:G pair at -194) and the mutant (A:T pair at -194) (Yang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]).\nTo anneal the DNA, incubate the mixed complementary DNA at 95°C for 5 min in a metal bath and then cool down to room temperature (∼25°C). Determine the concentration by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. Store at 4°C for up to 2 weeks.\nCrystallization of ZBTB7A protein in complex with -200 element DNA\nTiming: ∼1 year\nIn this section crystallization and structural determination of the ZBTB7A in complex with -200 element with C-194A mutation is described (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1872-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Structure determination of ZBTB7A in complex with -200 element with a C-194A mutation\nThe crystallization process consists of crystal screening and optimization by hanging drop method, picking the crystal that is suitable for X-ray diffraction, data collection at SSRF and structure determination.\nPool protein-containing fractions and measure the protein concentration by absorbance at 280 nm.\nTo perform protein-DNA complex formation by dialysis, mix ZF1-4 of ZBTB7A and the double-stranded DNA in a 1:1.2 molar ratio, and then dialyze the mixture against low salt DNA binding buffer at 4°C overnight (∼ 12–16 h). Transfer to a new DNA binding buffer and dialyze for another 4 h. Remove any precipitate by centrifuging at 15,871 × g at 4°C for 30 min. Concentrate the supernatant to ∼5 mL using an Amicon Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit (3 KDa MWCO) at a speed of 2,800 × g at 4°C.",
    "Note: Dialysis is a mild method used to exchange the buffer, which facilitates the protein and DNA to form a stable complex. Furthermore, overnight (∼ 12–16 h) dialysis may be performed which is also timesaving. Alternatively, protein and DNA buffer could be exchanged to low salt DNA binding buffer directly by centrifugation (repeated 3 times at least). Then, incubate protein and DNA in an appropriate molar ratio.\nInject the supernatant onto a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg column pre-equilibrated with 1.5 CV low salt DNA binding buffer and run at 1 mL/min. The ZBTB7A-DNA complex elutes at ∼70 mL on this column.\nPool protein-DNA containing fractions and concentrate to desired concentration (∼1.2 mM in our study). Measure the absorbance at 260 nm on a spectrophotometer (the complex molar concentration is equal to absorbance at 260 nm/MW (dsDNA)), and then centrifuge at 15,871 × g for 20 min before crystallization trials.\nNote: In this step, add TCEP to a final concentration at 0.5 mM. Then incubate the sample in a 37°C water bath to promote the protein-DNA homogeneity. After that, perform the centrifugation at 15,871 × g at 4°C for 20 min. In our opinion, this step may have been critical to our success in obtaining well diffracted crystals.\nCritical: The concentration of the protein-DNA complex should be above 1 mM to increase the success rate of crystallization.\nPerform crystallization screening using commercially available Index/Crystal Screen/Natrix/PEG/Ion Screen (Hampton Research), Structure Screen/Proplex Screen/The Stura Footprint Screen/Macrosol (Molecular Dimensions), The PACT Suite (QIAGEN).\nGrow the crystals by mixing 1 μL protein-DNA complex and 1 μL reservoir buffer against 200 μL reservoir solution at 20°C via the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method.",
    "Rod crystals appear in three days in 0.1 M MIB buffer (produced by mixing sodium malonate, imidazole, and boric acid in the molar ratio of 2:3:3), pH 7.0 and 25% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 1500, which are suitable for X-ray diffraction.\nPick the crystals using appropriate size loops under an optical microscope. Transfer the crystals with loops and wash them with mother liquor, then in cryo-protector made of mother liquor supplemented with 25% (v/v) glycerol before being flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.\nNote: The loop used to pick the crystal should be carefully selected, and the crystal should sit at the center of the loop. Additionally, the concentration of glycerol in cryo-protector should be optimized. For example, pipette 3 μL cryo-protector and insert in liquid nitrogen. If it is transparent, the concentration is appropriate. Otherwise, increase the concentration of glycerol.\nStore crystals in liquid nitrogen and ship to the beamline BL19U1 at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF).

    "Deposit final models and scaled reflection data to the PDB (our data are ID:7EYI).\nIsothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to determine dissociation constants (KDs)\nTiming: 2 weeks\nTo compare the binding affinities between ZBTB7A and WT or HPFH-associated mutant DNA, an ITC assay was chosen to measure the dissociation constants (Gontier et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). This method was also used to determine the dissociation constants between BCL11A and -115 element of γ-globin gene promoter to evaluate the DNA mutations occurred at G-117 and G-114 position (Yang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]).\nDialyze ZBTB7A protein in ITC titration buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM or 300 mM NaCl) overnight (∼ 12–16 h), then filter the buffer for future use.\nConcentrate the protein to the desired concentration (∼0.3–0.4 mM in our paper) as measured by absorbance at 280 nm, then centrifuge at 15,871 × g at 4°C for 20 min to get rid of any bubbles before ITC trials.\nDNA annealing. For each mutant DNA sample, dissolve the DNA strands to a concentration of 100 μM, and then diluted to the desired concentration (∼20–30 μM) in the filtered ITC titration buffer.\nAdjust the pH to the same as ITC titration buffer. Centrifuge at 15,871 × g at 4°C for 20 min to get rid of any bubbles before ITC trials.",
    "Note: ITC is compatible with most buffers, such as Tris and HEPES buffers. In addition, the ZBTB7A protein is very stable in Tris buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 or 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) as verified by SDS-PAGE, showing no aggregated or degraded bands. The C-value of the fitted curves should be considered before selecting the initial concentration of sample in the cell (Ge et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Amano et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), because this is a critical parameter which determines the shape of the binding curves. C-value=Ccell×N/KD (Ccell is the concentration of the sample in the cell, N is stoichiometry and KD is the dissociation constant), whereas the Csyringe= 10–20×Ccell. To measure KD accurately, the C-value should be in range of 10–1000, with a value from 50-500 being ideal (Ge et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Amano et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). We set the initial concentration of sample in the cell to 25 μM (in 150 mM NaCl) and performed the ITC assay. The C-value was 71.4 which is in the range of 50–500. This provided the rationale for the selection of the initial concentration of sample in the cell at 20–30 μM.\nCritical: Both protein and DNA samples need to be de-gassed by centrifugation before ITC trails.\nSoak the ITC instrument in 12% Decon 90 for 1 h, then wash with the cleaning module. Conduct a water-to-water titration experiment to test the performance. In theory, the difference value of differential power (DP) should be less than 0.05. A value of less than 0.02 indicates that the ITC instrument is in good state.",

The titration protocol is the same for all the measurements, which is composed of a single initial injection of 1 μL protein, followed by 19 injections of 2 μL protein into DNA samples, the intervals between injections is set to 150 s, the reference 3power is 5 μcal s−1 and the temperature is set to 20°C (see troubleshooting 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.17]). The reaction parameters for ITC measurements are:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1872_15.csv\nNote: The ITC titration buffer for determining dissociation constants between protein and wild type or C-194A mutant DNA contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. The ITC titration for determining dissociation constants between protein and wild type or HPFH-associated mutant DNA contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.5.\nCritical: The protein and DNA should be taken out of ice and allowed to return to experimental temperature (20°C) before ITC assays, to avoid bubbles in the process of stirring.\nCalculate dissociation constants (KDs) by fitting the experimental data to a single-site binding model, using MicroCal PEAQ-ITC Analysis Software provided by the manufacturer.

    "Effect of NaCl concentration. The difference of KD values between protein and wild type or HPFH-associated mutant DNA in 150 mM NaCl were not apparent (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Hashimoto et al. (2014)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] demonstrated that the WT1+KTS isoform binds most strongly to 5caC-containing DNA in 200 mM NaCl, but with a considerably lower affinity (∼50-fold decrease) in 300 mM NaCl. This suggests that KD values are sensitive to the concentration of NaCl. We increased the concentration of NaCl in the ITC titration buffer from 150 mM to 300 mM which allowed us to determine the ITC measurements of ZBTB7A against wild type or HPFH-associated mutant DNA (Yang et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]) (see troubleshooting 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.19]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1872-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. ITC evaluation of HPFH-associated mutations in 150 mM NaCl",
    "Note: ITC is a label-free method, but the experiments require more materials and high concentration. ITC allows determination of binding constants (KD), enthalpy (ΔH), entropy (ΔS), and the reaction stoichiometry (n), thereby an entire thermodynamic analysis of molecular binding can be obtained in an individual analysis by applying this technique. ITC is usually used to determine the binding affinities between protein-protein or protein-ligand interactions but can also be applied to measure the dissociation constants between protein-DNA interactions (Li et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Yu et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). Recently, Yang et al. (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] and Qiu et al. (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17] reported the complex structures of ZF proteins BCL11A and REF6 bound to γ-globin -115 element or hypo-methylated DNA motif, respectively. They further demonstrated that HPFH-associated DNA mutations substantially weaken the interaction with BCL11A, and that REF6 has a relatively low affinity for a methylated DNA motif, by ITC experiments (Yang et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]; Qiu et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]), which are both consistent with in vivo experiments. If target proteins are stable and able to be prepared with a high yield, ITC is a good method to detect binding affinities. Otherwise, FP assays is a good alternative to determine dissociation constants."
