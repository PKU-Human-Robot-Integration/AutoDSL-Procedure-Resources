    "Important note: This protocol assumes that the mold containing the shape for the desired microchannels has been already made. Further information on the preparation of the mold has been already published10. This protocol also assumes that bone marrow DCs culture is known.\n1. Chip Fabrication\nMix PDMS oil and curing agent at a weight ratio 10:1 in a plastic cup. Mix both compounds thoroughly.\nCast the mix over the mold bearing microchannels. The total height must be between 0.5-1 cm.\nRemove air bubbles in a vacuum jar bell during 1 hr.\nHarden PDMS in the mold by placing the latter in an oven for 2 hr at 65 °C.\nOnce the PDMS is at room temperature, cut a large piece around the structure with a surgical blade and peel it off from the mold (Figure 1A).\nDrill holes where cells will be injected (typically 2 mm) and resize the PDMS with a surgical blade to fit the size to glass-bottom dishes in which migration will be assessed (Figure 1B). Before proceeding, remove residual dust from the dish using lens cleaning paper. This favors the binding of PDMS to glass described in step 1.10.\nClean the resized PDMS chip containing the channels by sticking and peeling adhesive tape on the structure sides.\nSonicate the PDMS pieces 30 sec in 70% ethanol to remove dusts and small PDMS particles. Dry them quickly afterwards by blowing clean air.\nActivate the PDMS (structures upwards) and culture dishes by air (or oxygen) plasma treatment during 30 sec at 300 mTorr.\nPlace both activated surfaces in contact to permanently stick the PDMS to the substrate. If needed, use metallic forceps to press slightly on top of the PDMS to force the contact between the polymer and the glass of the dish (Figure 1C).",
    "Incubate the chip in the oven at 65 °C for 1 hr to strengthen the binding.\n2. Coating of Microchannels\nActivate the whole structure by air plasma at 300 mTorr for 1 min. This will promote the entry of liquid into the channels at the next step.\nFill rapidly the entry holes of the chip with fibronectin at 10 μg/ml in water. Other substrates such as PEG may be used to modify cell adherence to the channel walls. Pay attention that the liquid spreads throughout the entire structure. This can be easily checked by eye under regular light or using a regular bright field microscope.\n\tNOTE: In very small structures, in which diffusion is harder, entry of liquid in the channels can be forced by placing the structure in a vacuum jar bell during at least 15 min. To verify the efficiency of the coating fluorescent substrates can be used (Figure 2).\nIncubate 1 hr at room temperature to allow adsorption of the fibronectin or any other coating substrate to the walls of the channels.\nWash the structures 3x with PBS to remove the nonbound substrate.\nAfter washing, proceed to Protocol 3 or store the chip at 4 °C for a later use (24 hr maximum).\n3. Cell Loading\nRemove the PBS from the plate and fill the microsystem with cell medium. Let incubate for 1 hr to saturate the channels with the medium.\n\tNOTE: For experiments involving drugs like molecule inhibitors, it is advised to preincubate the channels with a medium containing the drug at the right concentration. Moreover, some drugs tend to solubilize in the PDMS structure which reduces the effective concentration. Some solutions have been proposed to counteract this issue11-12.\nRemove floating DCs and recover semi-adherent cells by flushing with culture medium. Count cells using a hemocytometer.",
    "NOTE : For nucleus imaging, a Hoechst 33342 staining can be achieved beforehand by incubating 2 x 106 cells during 30 min with the dye at 200 ng/ml in complete medium. Wash twice by centrifugation to remove excess of dye before continuing the protocol.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g during 5 min (time and speed can be different depending on the cell type) and discard the medium. Dilute the pellet to reach a concentration of 20 x 106 cells/ml.\nRemove the excess of medium from the plate and empty the entry holes in the PDMS structure using a micropipette. Fill the entries with 5 µl of cell solution to reach an amount of 1 x 105 cells in each entry hole.\n\tNOTE: High cell density is required to favor the contact of the cells with the channels. Low cell density may result in low number of cells inside channels and failure of the experiment.\nIncubate the microchip for 30 min at 37 °C in the incubator. Add 2 ml of complete medium to the experiment dish.\n\tNOTE: The whole PDMS structure must be covered in order to avoid drying of the cells during the experiment. If 2 ml is not enough, add more medium to completely cover the PDMS structure.\n4. Imaging\nClean the external bottom surface of the dishes with lens cleaning tissue before placing the plates under the microscope.\nTo analyze migration in large number of cells, use 10X magnification and wide field illumination in a CO2 and temperature equipped video-microscope (Figure 3). To facilitate cell tracking, Hoechst staining and UV light can be used (see step 3.2). Migration can be also analyzed using confocal microscopy in order to get higher resolution of cellular structures during migration.",
    "For time-lapse microscopy at 10X, choose a time frequency according to the expected cell speed (typically 2 min for dendritic cells migrating with a speed of 5 μm/min).\nNote: The protocol described here does not include the analysis of the cell migration parameters. A few points are listed in the discussion to advise the readers on how to proceed to extract information from time-lapse movies.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
