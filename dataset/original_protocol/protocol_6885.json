    "Protein extraction and filter-aided sample preparationHomogenize frozen tissues by grinding with a mortar and pestle under liquid nitrogen. Lyse ground tissues (25 mg per human disease or control case) in 150 µl lysis buffer (4% SDS, 100 mM DTT, and 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6) at room temperature, followed by incubation at 95°C for 5 min as described (Wisniewski et al., 2009; Wisniewski, 2017). No protease inhibitors are added to the lysis buffer because the presence of SDS efficiently inactivates protease functions (Wisniewski et al., 2009).After cooling the homogenates to room temperature, perform centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min to obtain supernatants containing extracted proteins.Determine the concentrations of total protein in protein extracts by UV spectrometry at 280 nm in a cuvette with a 10-mm pathlength using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer with an extinction coefficient of 1.1 for 0.1% (g/L) solution (Wisniewski et al., 2009).Spike each protein extract by pipetting a small volume of bovine α2-HS-glycoprotein (fetuin) stock solution (0.4 µg/µl bovine fetuin in lysis buffer) to reach a final concentration of 0.1% fetuin (µg/µg total protein). The spiked-in bovine fetuin protein serves as an internal control for technical variations during sample processing and analysis.Process the protein extracts as described (Zhang et al., 2018) according to the filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) protocol (Wisniewski et al., 2009; Wisniewski, 2017).Mix 30 µl protein extract with 200 µl UA solution (8 M urea in 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5).Transfer the mixture into a Microcon 30-kDa centrifugal filter unit (MRCF0R030, Merck) and centrifuge at 14,000 × g for 15 min. Discard the flow-through.Add 200 µl UA solution to the filter unit and repeat the centrifugation. Discard the flow-through.Add 100 μl UA solution containing 50 mM iodoacetamide to the filter unit and incubate in the dark for 30 min at room temperature.",

Slowly push down the plunger to allow the solvent to flow through the ZIC-HILIC column without causing resin compression.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4059/bioprotoc-11-12-4059-g002.jpgFigure 2.
