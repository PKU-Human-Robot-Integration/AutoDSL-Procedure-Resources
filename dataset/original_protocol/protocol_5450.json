    "Procedures A and B are also applicable to the assay to determine phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by cardiac macrophages and Cardiac Myofibroblasts (Horii et al., 2017).Establishment of an MI mouse model by surgical operationPrepare an 8- to 10-week-old male wild type mouse of the strain, C57BL/6J.In order to anesthetize the mouse, administer pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) via an intraperitoneal injection.Fixate the mouse on its back with surgical tape.Perform artificial respiration by using a respirator (volume of air for respiration: 0.5 cc, respiratory frequency: 120 bpm).Under an optical microscope, surgically open the chest and expose the heart using sterilized surgical tools.Perform the permanent occlusion of the left coronary artery by using 8-0 braided silk (see Video 1).Close the chest by using 5-0 braided silk.After the operation, give the mouse the appropriate treatment, and keep it warm until recovery.    <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1. How to establish an MI mouse model   Isolation of cardiac myofibroblasts from the MI mouse modelEuthanize two mice after 3 days of the MI operation by administering pentobarbital (150 mg/kg) via an intraperitoneal injection.Open the chest by using sterilized scissors to expose the heart.Cut the right atrium and prick the left ventricle with a 10 ml syringe containing 10 ml of ice-cold PBS and mounted with a 23-gauge needle.Perfuse the heart with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS.Collect the heart, and remove the atria.Put the heart in a 50 ml tube containing 10 ml of ice-cold PBS for storage, while other mice are being sacrificed.Discard the supernatant and add 5 ml of ice-cold PBS.Transfer the heart along with PBS into a 6 cm dish from the 50 ml tube on a clean bench.Cut each heart into 15 small pieces using two surgical lancets, while keeping them on ice.Discard PBS.To wash the heart pieces, sprinkle 5 ml of PBS on them.",
    "Repeat steps B10-B11.Transfer the heart pieces into a 50 ml tube, and remove PBS.Add 4 ml of collagenase A solution (see Recipes) to the tube.Incubate the tube containing the mixture of the minced hearts and collagenase A solution in a water bath at 37 °C, while shaking at 120 rpm for 10 min.Discard supernatant which contains numerous hematopoietic cells.Repeat steps B14-B16 once again.Add 4 ml of collagenase A solution to the tube which now contains the residual material.Incubate the tube containing the mixture of the minced hearts and collagenase A solution in a water bath at 120 rpm and 37 °C for 10 min.Pass the supernatant, which contains isolated cells, through a 70 µm EASYstrainerTM into a new 50 ml tube.Centrifuge the collected cell suspension at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature, and discard supernatant.Add 1 ml of the culture medium (see Recipes) to the cell pellet, and keep it on ice.Repeat steps B18-B22, eight times in total.After eight agitations, combine all the cell suspensions (1 ml x 8) into a new 50 ml tube.Centrifuge this cell suspension at 300 x g for 5 min, and discard the supernatant after centrifugation.Suspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of RBC lysis buffer, and incubate for 1 min at room temperature.Add 9 ml of the culture medium to the cell suspension.Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 x g for 5 min, and discard the supernatant after centrifugation.Suspend the cell pellet in 10 ml of the culture medium.Plate this cell suspension on a 10-cm non-treated dish, and incubate overnight in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C.After overnight incubation, discard the culture medium, and add 10 ml of fresh culture medium.Culture the isolated cardiac cells for more than 6 days.",
    "Note: Myofibroblasts attach themselves to the plate; unattached contaminating cells, including hematopoietic cells, are removed by changing the culture medium. When the myofibroblasts reach pre-confluence, passage them.One day before conducting the in vitro phagocytosis assay, discard the culture medium from the dish, and wash the dish twice with 10 ml of PBS.Add 1 ml of trypsin/EDTA, and incubate at 37 °C for 1 min.Add 9 ml of the culture medium, and transfer the cell suspension into a 15-ml tube.Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 x g for 5 min, and discard the supernatant after centrifugation.Add 10 ml of the culture medium, and suspend the cell pellet.Count the cell number, and adjust it to 1 x 105 cells/ml by adding the culture medium.Add 200 µl of this cell suspension to an 8-well slide chamber coated with poly-L-lysine (2 x 104 cells/well, see Recipes).Incubate in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C overnight.Preparation of necroptotic L929 cellsSeed 2.5 x 106 L929 cells on a 10 cm non-treated dish containing the culture medium.Incubate in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C overnight.Aspirate the medium, and wash twice using 10 ml of serum-free DMEM.Add 10 ml of serum-free DMEM containing 10 µl of 10 mM CMFDA dye (see Recipes) (final concentration would be 10 µM).Incubate in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 30 min.Aspirate the medium, and incubate on ice for 1 min.Wash 4 times using 10 ml of the culture medium.Add 10 ml of the culture medium containing 20 µl of 10 mM Z-VAD-FMK (see Recipes) (final concentration would be 20 µM).Incubate in a CO2 incubator for 2 h.Add 10 µl of 10 µg/ml hTNF-α solution (see Recipes) (final concentration is 10 ng/ml).Incubate in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 4 h.",
    "Transfer the supernatant into a 50 ml tube.Note: The supernatant contains necroptotic L929 cells.Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 x g for 5 min, and discard the supernatant after centrifugation.Add 10 ml of the culture medium.Repeat steps C13 and C14 thrice totally.Count the cell number.Adjust the cell number to 1 x 106 cells/ml with culture medium.Phagocytosis assayPrepare the cardiac myofibroblasts cultured with 200 µl of culture medium per well on the 8-well slide chamber in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C (this slide was made in B40).Discard the supernatant.Add 200 µl of CMFDA-labeled necroptotic L929 cells at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml (2 x 105 cells/well).Note: The number of engulfed necroptotic cells is 10 times the number of phagocytes per well.Incubate for 3 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator.Discard the supernatant, and wash with 200 µl of PBS thrice.Note: Unengulfed necroptotic cells are attached to phagocytes, and these cells are removed by washing with PBS.To fix the cells, add 200 µl of 1% PFA/PBS solution, and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.Discard the supernatant, and wash with 200 µl of PBS.Discard the supernatant, and remove the chamber wall from the glass slide.Mount the slide with FluorSaveTM reagent containing 0.1% DAPI, and place a cover glass over the glass slide.Observe under phase contrast and fluorescence microscopes.Note: Images are captured at 20x magnification by  BZ-9000  . Obtain phase contrast images as well as the images captured by using GFP-BP and DAPI-BP filters."
