    "1. 3D Cell Culture and Preparation for Imaging\nCulture an appropriate cell line, i.e., HCT116 colon carcinoma cell line, in two dimensional, monolayer culture.\nGrow HCT 116 cells in a T-25 flask with McCoy's 5A media + 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator until 50-70% confluency, which generally takes a few days.\nRelease cells with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA solution and count a portion of the cells using a hemocytometer and trypan blue staining to check for cell density and viability.\nAfter counting, dilute cells with complete medium to achieve an appropriate seeding density of 6,000 cells/well, or 30,000 cells/ml.\n2. Prepare Agarose Coated 96 Well Plates\nAdd 0.19 g of agarose to 10 ml of standard media in a 50 ml conical tube (1.5% agarose solution in media) 10. Ensure incorporation by gentle mixing. Autoclave the agarose in a water bath for 20 min.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, aspirate 50 µl of the agarose + media mixture into the 60 central wells of the flat bottomed 96 well plate culture plate. As the wells at peripheral edges of the plate have slightly higher evaporation rates, add 200 μl 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) instead of the agarose to these edges.\nOnce the agarose mixture has been added to the inner wells, set the plate aside to cool to ~37 °C before the addition of the cells.\n3. Seed and Tend the Three-dimensional Culture\nNOTE: More or fewer cells may be seeded depending on the requirements of the culture involved, but it has been determined that these conditions result in 3D cell culture structures of approximately 1 mm in diameter after 10-14 days of culture (data not shown).",
    "Add 200 μl of the appropriate cell solution (diluted to contain ~6,000 cells) to the agarose-coated 96 well plate. Cover the plate and set in humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C for cell growth.\nChange cell media a minimum of every 48 hr, or when the media appears to be changing color.\n\t\nChange media by carefully aspirating the old media from around the small 3D cell culture (visible to the naked eye by day 2) at the bottom of the agarose. Add 200 µl of fresh media gently over the 3D cell culture.\n(Optional step) During these media changes, add chemotherapeutics or other drugs for testing. Dilute the drug of choice to the final concentration with complete media and add the requisite 200 µl to each well.\nMonitor 3D cell culture growth by optical microscope, until the 3D cell cultures are approximately 1 mm in diameter.\n4. Harvest the 3D Cell Cultures\nUse a 2 ml serological pipette to gently remove the 3D cell culture from the agarose bed.\nWash the 3D cell cultures with PBS by gently pipetting them into approximately 1 ml PBS in a waiting 24 well plate.\nTransfer harvested 3D cell cultures via serological pipet to centrifuge tubes for protein or metabolite extraction, or embed them in a cutting medium to assist in slicing for imaging applications.\n5. Embed the 3D Cell Cultures in Gelatin\nPrepare a solution of ~175 mg/ml gelatin in high purity water (18 MΩ preferred).22,23 Mix the gelatin vigorously. Observe the solution becoming viscous and difficult to manipulate. Place the gelatin-containing conical tube in a water bath at ~60 °C and warm until the solution becomes clear and easy to aspirate.",
    "NOTE: The warm gelatin solution hardens rapidly as it cools, so perform all of the following steps rapidly before freezing.\nAfter it is heated, take the gelatin immediately to the cell culture hood. Keep the tube with gelatin in a beaker with preheated water at about 60 °C to avoid hardening of the gelatin solution.\nUsing a 2 ml serological pipette, deposit 0.6 ml of the warm gelatin solution into the well of a 24 flat-bottomed plate. This volume is sufficient to cover the bottom in a thin layer. Gently deposit the 3D cell cultures immediately on top of the gelatin layer using a different 2 ml pipette to avoid rupturing the 3D structure.\n\tNOTE: Care must be taken at this stage not to place PBS into the gelatin. If this happens, however, remove the PBS from the top of the gelatin using a 200 μl pipette.\nAfter the 3D cell cultures are placed on the surface of the gelatin layer, carefully pipette another 0.6 ml of the warm gelatin mixture over the 3D cell cultures, so as to not disturb the position of the cultures. After the second layer is placed, freeze the gelatin-embedded 3D cell cultures at -80 °C.\n6. Slice and Thaw Mount the Gelatin-embedded 3D Cell Cultures for Mass Spectrometric Imaging\nRemove the 24 well plate containing the 3D cell cultures from the freezer. Warm the bottom of the plate with the heat from your hand until a tweezer or scalpel will slide gently down the side of the well.\nSmoothly slide the tweezer or scalpel, freeing the gelatin without thawing the center. Take a drop of water to the cryostat support and use this to adhere the gelatin disk to the support.",
    "3D cell cultures embedded in gelatin are most amenable to slicing at -30 °C. Clean the cryostat blade and glass with 70% ethanol before use. Use a different part of the blade or a new blade for each 3D cell culture-gelatin disc to prevent dulling of the blade.\nUsing the cryostat, gently face off the excess gelatin until the 3D cell cultures become visible.\nAt this point slowly slice the 3D cell cultures with a smooth motion in 12-16 μm sections.\n\tNOTE: Critical factors to slicing include the distance of the glass to the blade, the blade angle, the temperature of the cryostat, and the angle of the disk on the support, so all of these must be checked to ensure consistent results.\nCarefully thaw the slices and mount them on indium titanium oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides labeled appropriately and store it in a desiccator. Use the slices as quickly as possible for maximum quality.\n7. Matrix Application and Sample Preparation for MALDI Imaging\nPrior to MALDI imaging, prepare slices with the appropriate matrix.\n\t\nFor small molecule analysis, no washing steps are generally required. For intact protein detection, wash the slices in cold 100% acetone, Carnoy's fluid, or 70%/95% isopropanol to remove small molecules such as lipids that could mask the signal.24–26\nGently wash for no more than 30 sec at a time. Do not to disturb any slices.\nPrepare matrix in a solution of organic solvent and water, with 0.1% TFA. For small molecule such as α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA), use 60% ACN:40% H2O:0.1% TFA (10 mg/ml). For protein detection such as sinapic acid (30 mg/ml), use the same solvent solution. For optimal solubility of the sinapic acid, dissolve first in acetonitrile before addition of the TFA:H2O solution. Other matrices may be used as appropriate.",
    "NOTE: Matrix can be applied with several different methods, but it should be noted some matrixes have been found to co-crystalize with the gelatin, such as ferulic acid, rendering the sample unusable. Smaller crystals produce more consistent mass spectra, allowing for more molecular species to be detected and attributed to biological differences rather than matrix effects.\nApply matrix by handspotting method.\n\t\nUse a fine-tipped syringe to apply 0.5 µl of the matrix solution on the 3D cell culture slice and allow the matrix to crystalize.\nAlternatively, use the airbrush method. Fill a commercial grade airbrush with the matrix solution.\n\t\nHold the sprayer 8-12 inches away from the slide, aim a fine spray at the slice. In between passes, allow the matrix to dry for 1 min to allow for the best crystal formation. Up to 10-20 passes of the airbrush is required to produce an optimal layer of matrix22.\nAlternatively, use the sublimation method detailed elsewhere.25,27\nDry slides in a desiccator for at least 30 min prior to MALDI-MSI, regardless of the method of matrix application.25\n8. MALDI-MSI Analysis Using a MALDI-TOF System (i.e., AutoFlex III)\nNOTE: This section contains instructions and advice for setting parameters for a MALDI-TOF imaging experiment. Depending on the instrument manufacturer and software used, the process may vary.\nFit the slides in an adapter made to securely hold 75 mm x 25 mm slides to image the 3D cell culture slices attached to ITO coated slides. Load the slide adapter into the instrument.",
    "Prepare the instrument for MALDI-MSI by selecting an appropriate calibration standard for the mass range in question. For interrogation of small molecules, the signals detected that correspond to the matrix used, α-CHCA, are one common group of calibrants. For analysis of proteins, known protein standards (i.e., ubiquitin, trypsinogen) in the mass range of interest are selected and spotted adjacent to the 3D cell cultures as calibrants. Calibrate the instrument before proceeding with method development.\nPrior to imaging, develop data acquisition methods for the mass range of choice using the software provided by the instrument manufacturer. See Figures 1 and 2 for small molecule and protein imaging. For small molecule imaging, use reflectron mode for the highest mass resolution.\n\t\nAdjust the mass range for small molecule data acquisition between 100-1,000 m/z and for proteins between 8,000- 25,000 m/z. Adjust the mass range to encompass the region of choice while providing the highest mass resolution possible with the instrument.\nAdjust laser power, frequency, number of laser shots and spot size using the calibration solution and a nearby 'sacrificial' 3D cell culture slice. Observe these settings in the main instrument control software. Use the following settings as a recommended starting point: 60% power, 400 laser shots, ultra small spot size. These settings will vary across instruments and methods, so optimize instrument parameters to give the highest quality spectra for each specific instrument. Other parameters that can be adjusted include the detector gain, sample rate, and electronic gain. Save this method for use in the imaging software (i.e., AutoExecute Method that FlexImaging will draw upon).\n\t\tNOTE: Suppress ions below the mass range of interest (again found in the instrument control) so as to not interfere with detection.",
    "Develop protein data acquisition methods for the mass range of choice. Follow the same steps outlined above, but for the mid-to-high mass ranges, above about 3 kDa, use linear mode.\n\t\tNOTE: Settings will differ from those used for small molecule methods.\nSetup specific MS instrument parameters using the imaging software provided by the instrument manufacturer, such as FlexImaging for Bruker MALDI-TOF systems.\n\t\nCreate a new imaging file and folder, using the methods developed prior and saved. Select the instrument parameters such as raster spot size (change from the default about 200 µm to 50 µm), set up the instrument control method (setup in step 8.3.2 or 8.3.3), and position where to scan over the 3D cell culture.\nSelect three appropriate teach points on the sample, moving the laser to each in turn. Obtain the optical photograph from the MALDI-TOF laser control software using 'print screen'.\n\t\tNOTE: Many imaging software programs require an optical photograph of the sample to 'teach' the software where the laser is located, which can be obtained with a scanner or often the instrument camera.\nThen start the imaging process from the imaging software (not the instrument control) and acquire mass spectra from each slice. Observe most masses across the 3D cell culture and others localized to particular areas.\n9. Optional Data Analysis Methods\nFor targeted analysis, perform manual analysis of the spectra by clicking a mass in the mean spectrum, or allow the imaging software to automatically pick masses above a particular threshold (e.g., peaks above the top 20% threshold). For quality control, examine the distribution of matrix peaks or the mean spectrum.\nPerform statistical analyses with extracted datasets in mathematical software such as R or Matlab.\n\t\nExport single spectra in ASCII format, a readable text file, for loading into the software of choice.",
    "Convert the individual spectra to ASCII , mzXML, of mzML format for reading by several different software programs,28–31 or export the data as an Analyze (.img) format file, a common format used for other imaging applications such as MRI.32 Two open-source options for analysis are MSiReader and BioMap32,33.\nOnce the files are exported into a format readable by the software, load the dataset via the instructions in the respective software. After loading, perform post-acquisition processing, such as baseline removal and normalization.\nWith this dataset, perform statistical treatments such as principal component analysis of hierarchical clustering using either custom scripts or built in algorithms in software such as Matlab18."
