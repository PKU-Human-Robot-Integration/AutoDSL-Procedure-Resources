    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart 1. Fecal sample collection and storage\nTiming: 1–2 h/each time point\nCollect fecal samples into fecal tubes or cryopreservation tubes with at least 150 mg/tube and then flash-freeze in liquid nitrogen for storage at −80°C.\nNote: If researchers plan to detect the fecal microbiota and metabolites at the same time point, we recommend that fecal samples should be collected and then split into two tubes. The previous literature by Okahashi N. et al. can be referred to for details (Okahashi et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]).\nCritical: To analyze all changes in the intestinal environment, fresh feces are collected within 2 h or by stimulating defecation.\nPart 2. PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene V3V4 region library preparation\nPCR amplification\nTiming: approximately 7–8 h for 24 samples\nThis section describes the PCR setup and cycling conditions for sequencing the bacterial 16S rRNA gene V3V4 region.\nExtract genomic DNA from fecal samples using an Omega E.Z.N.A.® Stool DNA Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nPrepare the Master Mix (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) for amplicon PCR.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1789_1.csv\nNote: In order to enhance the amplification and sequencing efficiencies, we modified amplicon PCR primers, which are incorporated with the adapters and sample-specific barcode sequences.\nTransfer 17.5 μL of the prepared Master Mix into each well of a 96-well plate and add 7.5 μL of fecal DNA sample (on average, this contains 25 ng of DNA), mock DNA, or negative control per well. Pipette up and down several times to ensure proper mixing.\nSeal and spun the plate for 30 s to collect the liquid at the bottom of the wells.\nPlace the 96-well plate in a Thermo cycler, and run the amplicon PCR program following the settings shown in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1789_2.csv",
    "Perform PCR product clean-up using AMPure XP Beads s= according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.baidu.com/link?url=7sJkbK3c_VZaqfCcapWC22U7BHS43QeIOIJS8xy-ZMDnJw39m8dhkuS7A9WtTFC2Y-Anm6Hf3NMaIXw7vom4mjd8rWdx-_sI4PFUZvw5_9ecwi2q51-XgMakPPlnritr&wd=&eqid=92a11fe300004cd1000000036295ce70].\nAdd 1 μL AMPure XP beads per 1 μL PCR product.\nNote: We found that a 1 × volume of AMPure XP beads to the PCR product is the correct ratio to remove primer dimers and unused primers while leaving the PCR product intact. Users of this protocol may need to perform pilot experiments to ensure that this ratio also works for their experiments.\nVerify that the generated amplicons have the correct size by running the PCR products on a 2% agarose gel at 120 V.\nNote: The expected amplicon size is ∼630 bp.\n16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing\nTiming: 3 days\nThis section describes the Illumina sequencing conditions. These methods are performed at LC-Bio Technology Co., Ltd. in Hangzhou, China (www.lc-bio.com[href=http://www.lc-bio.com]).\nQuantify the concentration of the PCR amplicons using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kits according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.thermofisher.cn/order/catalog/product/Q32851].\nNote: Typical DNA concentrations range from 2 to 5 ng/μL.\nPool the amplicons equally such that approximately 25 ng of DNA per sample is loaded for sequencing.\nPerform the sequencing with a NovaSeq 6000 System (NovaSeq 6000 SP Reagent Kit v1.5).\nNote: The sequencing run should be carried out as 2×250 cycles utilizing 30% Phi-X Control V3.\nPart 3. LC–MS-based untargeted metabolomics\nMetabolite extraction\nTiming: approximately 4–5 h for 24 samples\nRemove the fecal sample and weigh 50 mg.\nTransfer the sample to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, add 500 μL of 50% (v/v) methanol/ultrapure water solution, and mix them thoroughly using an ultrasonic processor for 10 min at 4°C with 100 Hz.\nAdd 500 μL of acetonitrile to the sample solution and vortexed for 1 min to enhance the extraction efficiency.",
    "Note: To reduce the complexity of the sample and remove proteins, store the sample at −20°C for 2 h and then centrifuge at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C;\nCollect the supernatant and freeze-dried at −50°C and 0.2 Pa. vacuum;\nDissolve the sample in 100 μL of acetonitrile, and pipet 10 μL of each sample solution to prepare a pooled quality control sample.\nRun LC–MS\nTiming: approximately 16 h for 24 samples\nThis section describes the process of chromatographic separation and LC–MS analysis. These methods are performed at LC-Bio Technology Co., Ltd. in Hangzhou, China (www.lc-bio.com[href=http://www.lc-bio.com]).\nNote: All chromatographic separations are performed using a Vanquish Flex UHPLC System with an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column used for reversed-phase separation.\nInject 4 μL of each sample, set the flow rate is 0.4 mL/min, and the mobile phase consisted of solvent A (0.1% (v/v) formic acid/ultrapure water) and solvent B (0.1% (v/v) formic acid/acetonitrile).\nNote: The gradient elution conditions are set as shown in Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1789_3.csv\nMaintain the column at 35°C in the oven.\nDetect metabolites eluted from the column by TripleTOF 5600 plus.\nOperate Q-TOF in positive ion and negative ion modes separately.\nFor the positive-ion mode, the ion spray floating voltage is set at 5 kV, and for the negative-ion mode, it is set at - 4.5 kV. The MS data are acquired in the IDA mode.\nThe curtain gas pressure is set at 30 PSI, and the ion source gas1 and gas2 pressures are set at 60 PSI. The interface heater temperature is set at 650°C.",
    "The TOF mass range is 60–1200 Da. Survey scans are acquired every 150 ms, and as many as 12 signal ion scans are collected if the threshold of 100 counts/s is exceeded with a 1+ charge state. The entire collection cycle time is fixed at 0.56 s.\nSum four time bins for each scan at a pulse frequency of 11 kHz by monitoring the 40 GHz multichannel TDC detector with four-anode/channel detection.\nNote: Set the dynamic exclusion time of the scan to 4 s.\nCritical: During the collection process, the accuracy of the instrument is calibrated every 20 samples. Furthermore, a QC sample is analyzed every 10 samples to evaluate the stability of the LC–MS."
