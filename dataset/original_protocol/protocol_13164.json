    "This protocol has received approval and adheres to the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board of the University of South Florida. These guidelines affirm that respect for all forms of life is an inherent characteristic of biological and medical scientists conducting research. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to the procedures. The study included patients aged over 18 years with chronic, intractable (drug-refractory) nausea and vomiting resulting from gastroparesis of diabetic or idiopathic origin. Patients requiring routine MRI imaging were excluded from the study.\n1. Gastric per oral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM)\nPrior to the procedure, instruct the patients to consume liquids exclusively for 3 days.\nPlace patients under general anesthesia (following institutionally approved protocols) and perform intubation.\n\tNOTE: The method of induction is typically determined by the anesthesia team, but rapid sequence intubation to minimize the risk of aspiration is preferred.\nIn either the supine or left lateral position, insert a bite block (see Table of Materials) into the patient's mouth.\nAdvance the endoscope into the patient's esophagus and stomach to assess the pylorus. If there is concern about the presence of large amounts of retained food in the stomach (which could hinder case completion) or if any other abnormalities are observed, consider aborting the procedure.\nOnce the decision is made to proceed with the operation, withdraw the scope and secure a cap to the end of the scope.\nAdvance the scope into the pre-pyloric region. Utilize an endoscopic needle (either proprietary elevating fluid or saline mixed with epinephrine, see Table of Materials) to inject fluid and create a submucosal wheal. This can be done either in the lesser or greater curve at the patient's pylorus.\n\tNOTE: The lesser curve approach, as detailed by Brown et al.14, is preferred in this case.",
    "Use the endoscopic knife to create a transverse mucostomy, entering the submucosal plane.\nElevate and divide the submucosal plane until the pylorus is clearly visible. Endoscopically cut the pylorus.\nControl any bleeding using electrocautery through the endoscopic knife or coagulation graspers.\nClose the mucostomy with endoscopic clips or other closure devices, such as an endoscopic suturing device (see Table of Materials).\nKeep patients overnight for observation and initiate them on a PPI (Proton Pump Inhibitor) and carafate. Start a liquid diet immediately. Perform an upper gastrointestinal series at the surgeon's discretion.\nOn postoperative day 1, discharge the patient home. Schedule a follow-up appointment two weeks postoperatively.\nInstruct the patient to follow a liquid diet for two days, followed by a soft food diet. At the follow-up visit, liberalize their diet and discontinue acid suppression medications.\n2. Gastric neurostimulator placement\nNOTE: This procedure can be performed either simultaneously or separately from a pyloric intervention. On the day of the procedure, the patient is placed under general anesthesia (following institutionally approved protocols) and intubated.\nAccess the patient's abdomen in the supine position, either through a laparotomy or minimally invasive port sites (for either robotic or laparoscopic cases).\n\tNOTE: Port placement is described in Figure 1; if a stimulator is not being placed, then the 12 mm port can remain 8 mm.\nUpon entry into the abdomen, identify the pylorus and count 10 cm proximally along the greater curve of the stomach. Create marks at 1 cm intervals in the previously identified site.",
    "Obtain the leads for the stimulator and use the attached needle (see Table of Materials) to place them in the wall of the stomach. Both needles should be placed in parallel, and the tissue taken with the needle should be through the muscularis layer of the stomach, not into the lumen.\nUtilize endoscopy after lead placement to confirm that no violation of the lumen of the stomach has occurred.\nSecure the leads at two positions: at the entry point of the lead with 2-0 silk (see Table of Materials) through the pledget and at the distal end where the needle exited the tissue with the circle bumper and clips. Attach the stimulator to the leads.\nUse the clinical programmer, enclosed in a sterile pouch (such as an ultrasound probe cover, see Table of Materials), to check the impedance of the device. This impedance should fall between 200 and 800 ohms.\nSecure the stimulator in the pocket under the skin.\n\tNOTE: This can be accomplished using permanent suture through the apex of the battery and the underlying fascia, or by closing the overlying fat with absorbable suture.\nBefore concluding the case, check the impedance once more to confirm that the device is functioning normally.\nIf only a stimulator procedure is performed, discharge the patient home on postoperative day 1 and schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks at the clinic for evaluation of their stimulator. They may resume a regular diet.\n3. Combined pyloroplasty and gastric neurostimulator\nNOTE: In cases where patients have such severe symptoms that a combination of pyloroplasty and gastric neurostimulator placement is warranted, the pyloroplasty procedure is performed first. This can be done through a laparotomy incision or minimally invasively (robotic or laparoscopic).",
    "After placing the necessary ports, grasp the falciform ligament and elevate it to expose the pylorus. The pylorus can be identified either visually using the vein of Mayo or endoscopically.\nMark the proximal and distal portions of the pylorus with electrocautery. Use 2-0 absorbable suture to create stay sutures at 12 and 6 o'clock positions above the pylorus.\nElevate the stay sutures and longitudinally transect the pylorus. After completely dividing the pylorus, close it transversely either in two layers or one layer using appropriate barbed sutures (see Table of Materials).\nPerform a leak test and evaluate patency with the endoscope in place. Following the completion of the pyloroplasty, proceed with the placement of the gastric neurostimulator as previously described (step 2).\n\tNOTE: Please note that this combined procedure should not be offered to post-surgical patients, as outcomes with the gastric neurostimulator suggest it is less effective in this population.\nSubscription Required.
