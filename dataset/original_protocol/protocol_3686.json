    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nLabile heme is defined as heme loosely bound to acceptor molecules (i.e., proteins, DNA) and therefore present in metabolically active pool and accessible for signaling as alarmin in the various compartments of the cells (Gouveia et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Treatment with exogenous heme contributes this additional pool of heme in the cell and it is measured here by means of benzidine staining (total heme: bound and labile heme) or labile heme detection kit (Biovision). Both methods provide ability to measure labile heme, with exception that benzidine staining may detect also heme bound to hemoproteins.\nHeme treatment\nTiming: 30 min to 24 h\nThe goal of this step is to treat cells with exogenous heme and to study heme retention in different cellular compartments. We recommend treating cell lines with heme at concentrations ranging from 1 to 50 μM (optimal concentration may be determined dependently on the cell type). We recommend treating cell lines for short time points starting at 30 min and up to 24 h. The recommended treatment time with heme depends on the specific cell line. In prostate cancer cells the induction of HO-1 upon treatment with 50 μM heme is rapid (6–8 h) and heme levels intracellularly will decline thereafter, due to HO-1-mediated heme degradation (Canesin et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nCritical: Heme is light-sensitive and therefore this procedure should be performed in the dark with limited exposure of cells to the light.\nThaw an aliquot of heme (10 mM) and keep it in the dark (wrapping the tube in aluminum foil helps ensuring protection from light).\nPrepare complete medium and add heme at the desired concentration. Note that the medium turns darker upon addition of heme (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).",
    "Take out the cell plate from the incubator, aspirate the cell culture medium and add fresh complete medium with heme (1–50 μM).\nImmediately place the cell plate back into the humidified incubator at 37°C and incubate for appropriate time.\nNote: We recommend including control group of cells receiving no heme treatment, in order to determine baseline heme levels in specific cellular compartments.\nPrepare cell fractionation\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step allows extraction of subcellular protein fractions (nuclear and cytoplasmic). The fractionation is performed using the FractionPREP Cell Fractionation kit (Biovision). Each buffer has appropriate addition of the Protease inhibitor cocktail as suggested in the manufacturer’s protocol. The following steps by the manufacturer’s protocol are performed (https://www.biovision.com/fractionpreptm-cell-fractionation-kit.html[href=https://www.biovision.com/fractionpreptm-cell-fractionation-kit.html]). All aliquots of the cell fractionation kit need to be thawed on ice and therefore should be prepared 1–2 h prior start of the cell harvest.\nCritical: It is very important to remove all supernatant (Cytosolic Fraction) from the pellet (Nuclear Fraction) to avoid cross-contamination of the fractions.\nCollect and wash cells:\nTake out the cell plate from the incubator and aspirate cell culture medium.\nWash cells with 1× PBS.\nAdd 2–3 mL of 0.05% Trypsin containing EDTA to detach cells and incubate at 37°C for 5 min. Collect each sample in a 15 mL conical tube upon blocking the trypsin with 8 mL of complete cell culture medium containing 10% FBS.\nCentrifuge at 700 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nAdd 5 mL of ice-cold PBS, pipette several times to mix well. An aliquot of PBS should be placed on ice prior to cell harvesting.\nCentrifuge at 700 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of ice-cold PBS and transfer each sample to a clean microcentrifuge tube.",
    "Spin at 700 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nIsolate Cytosolic Fraction:\nResuspend the cell pellet in 400 μL of Cytosol Extraction Buffer, pipette several times to mix well on ice.\nIncubate samples on ice for 20 min and vortex every 5 min.\nCentrifuge the samples at 700 × g for 10 min.\nCollect the supernatant as the Cytosolic Fraction: place in a new Eppendorf tube and keep on ice.\nIsolate Nuclear Fraction:\nPrecool the centrifuge if necessary and place Membrane Extraction Buffer A and Eppendorf tubes on ice.\nResuspend the pellet in 400 μL of ice-cold Membrane Extraction Buffer A, pipette up and down several times to mix well.\nVortex for 15 sec.\nAdd 22 μL of Membrane Extraction Buffer B, vortex for 5 sec and incubate on ice for 1 min.\nVortex for 5 sec and centrifuge at 1,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\nThe supernatant contains the Membrane Protein fraction: this fraction is NOT used for heme measurements, so it can be discarded. If needed for other purposes, transfer the supernatant to a clean pre-chilled Eppendorf tube and keep on ice.\nResuspend the pellet in 200 μL of ice-cold Nuclear Extraction Buffer A and vortex for 15 sec to mix well.\nIncubate samples on ice for 40 min, vortexing for 15 sec every 10 min.\nSonicate samples.\nCentrifuge samples at maximum speed for 10 min at 4°C.\nCollect the supernatant as the Nuclear Fraction: place in a new Eppendorf tube and keep on ice.\nDetermine protein concentration in Cytosolic and Nuclear fractions samples by using the standard BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Cat# 23227).\nNote: Cytosolic and nuclear Fraction samples can be immediately used for heme measurements or stored at −80°C until used.\nMeasurement of labile heme using a commercial kit",
    "Timing: 1 h\nThis step allows measurements of labile heme in cells and/or cellular fractions by colorimetric assay. The measurement is performed using the Hemin Colorimetric Assay Kit (Biovision, Catalog #K672). The Hemin Colorimetric Assay kit measures the labile heme as per manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.biovision.com/hemin-colorimetric-assay-kit.html[href=https://www.biovision.com/hemin-colorimetric-assay-kit.html]): “The hemin assay kit detects free heme. Hemoglobin has heme in coordinated form with protein chains of alpha and beta globin. Heme bound in this form will not produce color in this assay.” The reaction is based on the conversion of a colorless probe to a strongly colored (λ = 570) compound in the presence of hemin. Follow kit instructions for reagents preparation prior to heme measurement.\nPrepare the Hemin Standard Curve:\nDilute the 10 μM Hemin Standard (included in the kit) to 100 nM by adding 10 μl of the Heme Standard to 990 μl of Hemin Assay Buffer.\nPipette up and down several times to mix well.\nDilute Heme Standard further to 10 nM (= 10 fmol/μl) by adding 100 μl to 900 μl Hemin Assay buffer.\nIn a 96 well plate, add 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 μl of Hemin Standard (included in the kit) into a series of wells and adjust the volume of each well to 50 μl by adding Hemin Assay Buffer. The final concentration of Hemin Standard in each well will be 0, 40, 80, 120, 160, 200 fmol/well, respectively (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/612-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Illustration of 96-well microplates with hemin standards prepared using hemin chloride dilution in Benzidine assay (left panel) or according to the Hemin Colorimetric Assay kit (right panel).\nPrepare Samples:\nWe suggest diluting samples 100-fold for prostate cancer cell lines but this will depend on the cell type that this protocol is applied for.",
    "Add 10 μl of diluted sample per well in duplicates in the 96 well plate.\nAdjust the volume of each well to 50 μl by adding Hemin Assay Buffer.\nNote: Sample dilution depends on the heme content in the fractions of cell type. We recommend a dilution of at least 100-fold for prostate cancer cell lines, but some samples may require further dilution (up to 10,000-fold) dependently on what heme concentration was used for treatment. It is beneficial to determine the dilution factor before the experiment. Using several doses of sample can help to ensure that the readings are within the standard curve range. The dilution might be adjusted based on protein levels. In the case of cell treatment with heme, it is suggested to test the dilution before measurement of a larger sample set.\nAdd Reaction Mix:\nFollowing the kit instruction, prepare the Reaction Mix.\nAdd 50 μl of the Reaction Mix to each well containing the Hemin Standard or the samples.\nIncubate for 10–30 min at RT (15°C–25°C), while protecting from light (cover the plate with aluminum foil).\nNote: The color of the wells will gradually turn pink (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). While the 30 min incubation time gives the best results in terms of linearity and sensitivity, we recommend monitoring the color development or reading the assay in kinetic mode.\nRead absorbance of the plate at 570 nm at spectrophotometer.\nMeasurement of total heme (labile and bound) by benzidine staining\nTiming: 10 min",
    "In this step, protein lysates are incubated with benzidine and total heme concentration is then determined by reading the absorbance using a spectrophotometer. Benzidine staining has been previously optimized for MEL cells (Chen et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Chung et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Chung et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), however, has not been used for adherent cancer cells. This staining works for the labile heme as well as the protein-bound heme.\nNote: If you run the Benzidine Staining in parallel with the Heme Commercial Kit measurement, you can use the same Standard Curve (see step 9) or prepare the standards from hemin chloride prepared as in step 1 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nLoad each well of a 96 well plate with 10 μL of protein lysate at a concentration of 5 μg/μL\nKeep the plate on ice until you add the Benzidine Staining Solution 14. Prepare Benzidine Staining Working Solution:\nIn a new Eppendorf tube, add 500 μL of Benzidine Stock Solution to 50 μL of 30% H2O2 Solution\nIn a new Eppendorf tube, dilute this solution 1:50 in PBS, to obtain the final Benzidine Staining Working Solution\nAdd 100 μL of Benzidine Staining Working Solution to each well containing the protein lysate\nIncubate the plate at RT (15°C–25°C or 59°F–77°F) for 5 min, protect from light (cover the plate with aluminum foil).\nNote: The wells will first turn green, then gradually change to a darker brown color\nRead absorbance of the plate at 570 nm at a spectrophotometer for both protocols.\nMeasurement of total heme by benzidine staining on fixed cells\nTiming: 1 h\nIn this step, Benzidine solution is used to stain cells that are grown on a glass coverslip and treated with heme (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Benzidine solution stains labile and protein-bound heme in cells attached to cover slips.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/612-Fig2.jpg",
