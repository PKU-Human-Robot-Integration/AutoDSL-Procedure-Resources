    "1. Patient Preparation\nRecruit patients prospectively and consecutively. Note: The following protocol is approved by the Sydney West Area Health Service Human Research Ethics Committees. Informed consent was provided by all patients. Patients were recruited prospectively and consecutively from the ALS/neuromuscular clinic at Westmead Hospital.\nDetermine suitability of ALS patients for testing. Exclude patients who are not diagnosed with ALS or a neuromuscular disorder.\nExclude patients with a coexistent focal neuropathy, median neuropathy at the wrist or ulnar neuropathy at elbow.\nExclude patients with a generalized neuropathy, such as diabetic polyneuropathy.\nExtensively investigate and clinically follow-up patients to confirm the diagnosis of ALS or neuromuscular mimic disorders.\nEnsure that informed consent is provided by all patients, including ALS and neuromuscular mimic disorder patients, for all the neurophysiological procedures.\n2. Clinical Assessment\nDetermine the clinical staging of all ALS patients by using the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) score18.\nDetermine the rate of disease progression in all ALS patients according to the previously reported formula;\n(48-ALSFRS-R)/duration of symptoms)19.\nDetermine muscle strength in all patients using the Medical Research Council (MRC) rating scale20. Develop a total MRC score comprising upper limb (shoulder abduction; elbow flexion; elbow extension; wrist dorsiflexion; finger abduction; thumb abduction, total score 60) and lower limb (hip flexion; knee extension; ankle dorsiflexion, total score 30) muscle groups. The total MRC score should be 90 if muscle strength is normal.\nDetermine the site of disease onset, defined as bulbar or limb, in all ALS patients.\n3. Neurophysiological Assessment\nUndertake motor nerve conduction studies on the median and ulnar nerves with compound muscle action potential (CMAP) responses recorded from the abductor pollicis brevis (APB), first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and abductor digit minimi (ADM) muscles.",
    "Prepare the stimulating sites at the wrist, by cleaning the skin surface with an abrasive gel to reduce skin resistance, followed by application of an alcohol wipe. Set the stimulating current to 20% above the intensity required to produce a maximal CMAP response (supramaximal current).\nEnsure that the selected stimulation site exhibits the lowest threshold for stimulation such that volume conduction is avoided.\nPrepare recording site over each muscle by cleaning the skin surface with an abrasive gel to reduce skin resistance, followed by application of an alcohol wipe.\nRecord the size of the compound motor action potential (CMAP) from the APB, ADM, and FDI muscles. Responses to be recorded by 10 mm gold disc electrodes positioned in a belly tendon arrangement over each muscle. Specifically, position the active electrode over the midpoint of the respective muscle ensuring a negative take-off of the CMAP response, while reference electrode to be positioned over the base of thumb (APB and FDI CMAP recordings) and base of digit 5 (for ADM CMAP recordings).\nSet the distance between the stimulating cathode and active electrode for APB and ADM compound motor action potential responses to 5 cm and the distance to the FDI at 8 cm.\nPosition the electrosurgical neutral earth plate on the dorsal aspect of the hand, between stimulating and G1 electrode, with conductive gel to reduce artifact. Prior to application of the neutral earth prepare the site by cleaning the skin surface with an abrasive gel to reduce skin resistance, followed by application of an alcohol wipe.\nEnsure the filter settings are between 3 Hz (low-frequency filter) and 10 KHz (high-frequency filter).\nEnsure that the sweep speed is set to 20 msec, or 2 msec/division.\nEnsure that the sensitivity for recording CMAP responses is set to 5 mV.",
    "Monitor temperature at the site of stimulation throughout the study and ensure that the limb temperature is maintained at 32 °C.\n4. Analysis and Interpretation\nMeasure baseline-to-peak CMAP amplitudes (mV) over the APB, FDI and ADM muscles in ALS patients and the neuromuscular mimic disease controls.\nCalculate the split hand index (Figure 1) by multiplying the CMAP amplitude recorded over the APB and FDI muscles, and dividing this product by the CMAP amplitude recorded over the ADM muscle, as follows:\nSI = APB CMAP * FDI CMAP\n\t_________________________\n\t           ADM CMAP\nDetermine the diagnostic utility of the split hand index by comparing the SI values between ALS patients and neuromuscular mimic disorder pathological controls according to the standards for reporting of diagnostic accuracy (STARD) criteria.\nDetermine optimal diagnostic cutoff values for the split hand index by using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Derive ROC curve by plotting the sensitivity (y-axis) and 1-specificty (x-axis) for SI values derived from ALS and neuromuscular disorder patients.\nSubscription Required.
