    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nEPO injection\nTiming: 4 weeks\nThis section describes the induction of AAA formation in three groups of WT mice receiving an intraperitoneal injection of EPO in a dose of 2500, 5000, and 10,000 IU/kg per day, respectively, for 4 weeks. Moreover, this protocol is also suitable for Apoe−/− mice.\nCalculate the injection volume for each mouse based on grouping and body weight. Give the control group normal saline via intraperitoneal injection.\nCritical: Perform EPO injection in a dark place. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nNote: Carried out the EPO intervention at the same time every day for four weeks.\nNote: The manner of EPO administration in this protocol is intraperitoneal injection, which is fast in drug absorption, easy in operation and steady in repeatability. However, intravenous injection is difficult to operate every day via vein in mouse. The absorption rate of drug via subcutaneous administration is slower than that of intraperitoneal injection. So that the intraperitoneal injection may be the best choice for both EPO absorption and easy operation.\nGrabbing mice.\nGrasp the fur on the mouse’s hackles and secure the head to prevent a bite.\nNote: Use moderate force to prevent the mouse from suffocating.\nFix the tail of the mouse with the ring finger or little thumb of the left hand, so that the whole trunk of the mouse can be fixed and kept upright (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2280-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Inject EPO solution into the peritoneal cavity of mice\nInjection.\nAfter grasping the mouse, try to keep the mouse abdomen in a level higher than the mouse head.\nNote: Ensure the abdominal organs moving to a lower position to avoid stabbing injuries.",
    "Hold the 1 mL syringe in the right hand, and insert the needle slowly into the mouse abdomen at 30–45 degrees at a depth of less than 1 cm with a sensation of the disappearance of needle resistance and injection into a cavity.\nDraw back the syringe to make sure the presence of a negative pressure and then inject the solution into the abdomen.\nNeedle removal: To prevent leakage, rotate the needle slightly and then slowly pull it out.\nNote: If you see a bulge on the skin, it is possible that you have made a subcutaneous injection.\nMonitor the mice daily for diet intake, water drinking, behavior, health status and deaths, during EPO injection. Approximately 15 days after the first injection, mice in the high-dose EPO group begin to develop AAA.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2280-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative photographs of WT and Apoe−/− mice with a dissecting AAA after EPO injection\n(A) A WT mouse had bilateral lower limbs paralysis.\n(B) The mouse (A) developed a dissecting AAA (indicated by the dashed frame).\n(C) A WT mouse developed massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage.\n(D) A WT mouse suffered from a large abdominal aortic hematoma (indicated by the dashed frame).\n(E) An Apoe−/− mouse had bilateral lower limbs paralysis.\n(F) The mouse (E) developed a dissecting AAA (indicated by the dashed frame).\n(G) An Apoe−/− mouse developed massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage.\n(H) An Apoe−/− mouse suffered from a large abdominal aortic hematoma (indicated by the dashed frame).\nNote: With the injection of EPO, the skin of mice may turn red, but the mobility of mice remains normal.",
    "Note: If you find a mouse manifested with bilateral lower limbs paralysis, it is likely that a dissecting AAA may have developed and this mouse is at a high risk of death (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2E). In this case, you have to end the EPO intervention, euthanize, and dissect the mouse to check the aorta (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2F).\nIn the case of sudden death of a mouse, perform an autopsy to ascertain the cause of death. You may see a massive intra-abdominal hemorrhage (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2G) or a large abdominal aortic hematoma (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D and 2H). You may observe thoracic hemorrhage occasionally.\nEuthanasia and tissue isolation\nTiming: 1–2 days\nThis section describes the details of euthanasia and aorta isolation.\nAnesthetize the mice with intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (80 mg/kg), and then euthanize the mice by cervical dislocation after deep reflex has disappeared.\nNote: The process of euthanasia must be in accordance with recommendations of international guidelines.\nFix the mice on the bench, cut the abdominal skin with a U-shape incision, and open the abdominal cavity (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2280-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Fix the mice on the bench, cut the abdominal skin with a U-shape incision, and open the abdominal cavity\nCritical: Be careful not to damage the liver when cutting the skin and peritoneum.\nCut the diaphragm along the edge of the ribs and bluntly isolate the fatty tissue around the heart and the pericardium to clearly expose the heart.\nUse a sterile syringe (1 mL or 2 mL) to draw about 1.5 mL of blood from the apical part of the heart. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nDrop a small amount of blood into an EDTA-containing anticoagulation tube (Becton, Dickinson and company, 367856) and flick the wall to mix blood well for whole blood testing.",
    "Note: If needed, you can use the whole blood to measure red blood cells counting, hemoglobin concentrations, hematocrit values, white blood cell counting, monocyte counting, lymphocyte counting, granulocyte counting and platelet counting.\nPlace the remaining blood in a procoagulant tube (Becton, Dickinson and company, 367955) at 25°C for 30 min, and then centrifuge it at 900 g for 15 min.\nNote: If needed, you can use the collected serum to measure serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine transaminase, aspartic transaminase, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen and serum EPO concentration.\nCollect the serum and store it at −80°C in the freezer.\nCut and open the right auricle and perform in vivo perfusion using normal saline (approximately 20 mL) until the liver, kidney, fat, and other tissues are adequately perfused with clear fluid flowing out of the right auricle.\nIsolate the heart, liver, spleen, kidney, and aorta.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2280-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative photographs of WT mice after EPO injection\n(A) A representative photograph of EPO-induced AAA in vivo.\n(B) A representative photograph of isolated aorta with EPO-induced AAA.\n(C) The relation between EPO-induced AAA and renal arteries in a mouse. The dashed frame indicated the AAA in the aorta.\nCritical: Carefully separate the periaortic connective tissue (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nNote: Prepare the isolated liver and kidney into paraffin sections. Stained the sections with H&E to observe whether there are morphological changes in the liver and kidney tissue after EPO injection. Measure the weights of heart and spleen to assess the impact of EPO injections. If Apoe−/− mice were chosen in this experiment, you can evaluate the plaque area in the cross sections of the aortic root by H&E and oil red O staining.",
    "Note: You can use a stereo microscope when separating the periaortic connective tissue. Soak the vascular tissue in cold normal saline to prevent degradation and complete the operation as soon as possible.\nNote: Isolate and preserve the entire aorta from the ascending aorta to the iliac artery, preferably preserving the right and left common carotid arteries and the left subclavian artery (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A and 4B).\nNote: The majority of EPO-induced AAA are proximal to the renal arteries (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nMeasure the external diameters of the abdominal aorta using vernier caliper and take photographs of the entire aorta.\nNote: Measure the maximum external diameter of the abdominal aorta with a vernier caliper. The definition of AAA is the localized dilation of the abdominal aorta with an external diameter exceeding the normal aortic diameter by 50%.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nRapidly froze a part of the tissues in liquid nitrogen and then transfer them to −80°C freezer for storage. Fix the rest part of the tissues in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h for subsequent experiments.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Isolate aorta, related to step 15\nPathological testing\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThis section describes the steps of AAA section preparation and staining.\nParaffin section preparation.\nCut a section with a length of about 0.5 cm from the AAA segment with the largest external diameter and put it into a tissue embedding cassette.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2280-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Instruments for paraffin section preparation and staining\n(A) Tissue wrapped with a gauze in the embedding cassette.\n(B) Automatic benchtop tissue processor.\n(C) Heated paraffin embedding station and cold plate.\n(D) Multifunctional slide stainer.\nNote: Label mouse groups on the cassettes with a pen that could not be removed in the aqueous or organic solvents, for example, a pencil.",
    "Note: If the tissue sample is too small, carefully wrap the sample with a gauze to prevent tissue loss (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nImmerse the cassettes in tap water, and rinse them with running water for 3–4 h to remove paraformaldehyde.\nPlace the cassettes in an automatic benchtop tissue processor (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B) and select an appropriate program as follows:\nwater for 10 min.\n70% ethanol for 2 h.\n80% ethanol for 2 h.\n90% ethanol for 2 h.\n95% ethanol I for 1 h.\n95% ethanol II for 1 h.\n100% ethanol I for 1 h.\n100% ethanol II for 1 h.\nHisto-Clear I for 45 min.\nHisto-Clear II for 45 min.\nParaffin I for 1.5 h.\nParaffin II for 1.5 h.\nSelect paraffin molds with an appropriate size for the tissues, dip the tissue in the molds filled with paraffin with the cut-side down, place them on the cold plate, wait for the paraffin to solidify, remove the paraffin blocks, and store them at 25°C (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nPause point: Keep the harvested tissues in 4% paraformaldehyde for 48 h at 25°C. You can store the paraffin embedded tissues for extended periods.\nTrim the paraffin blocks using a rotary microtome until the entire vascular lumen structure is exposed, and immerse the blocks in an ice-water mixture for 2 h.\nCut the paraffin tissues into consecutive 5 μm-thick slices and place them in 37°C warm water for spreading. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nNote: Pay attention to the section with disrupted elastic plate of the aortic wall which should be included during slicing.",
    "Gently pick up the tissue sections with adhesion microscope slides, put 2–3 pieces of tissue on each slide, drain residual water off the slide, place slides on the flattening table at 65°C for 2 h, put the slides into the section box and store them at 25°C.\nNote: Label tissue groups on the slides with a pen that could not be removed in the aqueous or organic solvents, for example, a pencil.\nParaffin section dewaxing.\nPlace sections in a multifunctional slide stainer (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D) and select the appropriate program for dewaxing as follows:\n65°C for 30 min.\nHisto-Clear I for 10 min.\nHisto-Clear II for 10 min.\n100% ethanol for 5 min.\n95% ethanol for 4 min.\n90% ethanol for 3 min.\n80% ethanol for 3 min.\n70% ethanol for 2 min.\nwater I for 5 min.\nwater II for 5 min.\nTake out the dewaxed sections for the following staining.\nHematoxylin-Eosin staining.\nPlace the dewaxed sections in hematoxylin staining solution for 3 min, and the nuclei are stained purple-blue under the microscope.\nPut the sections in water to wash out the remaining hematoxylin staining solution.\nPut the sections in alcohol containing 1% hydrochloric acid for differentiation, and the cytoplasm should be unstained while the nucleus should be stained blue-purple.\nPut the sections in running water for 0.5–1 min until the nucleus turned blue.\nPlace the sections in eosin staining solution for 3–5 min until the cytoplasm is stained pink.\nPut the sections in water to wash out the remaining eosin staining solution.\nPut the sections in a multifunctional slide stainer for dehydration as follows:\n80% ethanol for 5 s.\n95% ethanol for 1 min.\n100% ethanol I for 5 min.\n100% ethanol II for 5 min.\nHisto-Clear I for 5 min.\nHisto-Clear II for 5 min.",
    "Seal the sections: add a drop of neutral balsam on one side of the section and slowly cover the coverslip to avoid air bubbles, or use Fully Automated Glass Coverslipper.\nElastic lamina staining.\nPlace the dewaxed sections in working Elastic Stain Solution from Elastic (Connective Tissue Stain) Kit for 15 min.\nPut the sections in running tap water to wash out the remaining solution.\nDip the sections in Differentiating solution from Elastic (Connective Tissue Stain) Kit for 15–20 times.\nWash the sections in running tap water.\nCheck the elastic fiber staining under the microscope, and repeat step c-d until the elastic fibers are clearly stained showing black-blue.\nPut the sections in Sodium Thiosulfate Solution for 1 min for de-iodizing.\nWash the sections in running tap water.\nStain the sections in Van Gieson’s Solution from Elastic (Connective Tissue Stain) Kit for 2–5 min.\nDehydrate the section as follows:\n95% ethanol for 1 min.\n100% ethanol I for 5 min.\n100% ethanol II for 5 min.\nHisto-Clear I for 5 min.\nHisto-Clear II for 5 min.\nSeal the sections: add a drop of neutral balsam on one side of the section and slowly cover the coverslip to avoid air bubbles, or use Fully Automated Glass Coverslipper."
