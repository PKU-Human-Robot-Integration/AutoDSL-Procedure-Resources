    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nCulturing Yeast for Imaging\nTiming: 3 days\nSee Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] for overview.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/209-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic of Steps for Culturing Yeast for Imaging\nFour days before imaging, streak yeast cells onto a YPD plate.\nOn the day before imaging, in the morning: start a culture by inoculating one colony of yeast into 1 mL of SC medium (see protocol above). Grow at 30C while shaking/rotating.\nIn the evening, dilute cultures into prewarmed medium (30°C) to a density so that the cells have an optical density (OD600) of ~0.2–0.4 in the morning. If you are unsure how fast your strain grows, make a dilution series. The following dilutions can be used as starting points for strains exhibiting wildtype growth rates (90 min doubling time in glucose, 180 min doubling time in raffinose, 150 min doubling time in galactose):\nIn glucose, add 1 μL of culture in 5 mL of fresh medium.\nIn raffinose or galactose, add 2 μL of culture in 2 mL of fresh medium.\nCritical: It is important that, during growth, yeast cells stay in mid-log phase (OD600 of 0.3–0.8). At higher OD, the carbon source becomes exhausted and cells will switch to a growth mechanism based on aerobic respiration. This is referred to as the diauxic shift, and during this process yeast cells become autofluorescent at various wavelengths, lower expression of the fluorescent proteins, and display uneven fluorescence distributions.\nCritical: For growth, SC medium is used rather than YPD, to reduce background fluorescence.",
    "Optional: If fluorescence imaging requires labeling with a dye (such as HALO dyes; e.g., JF646 or JF552 (Grimm et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8])) this dye can be added to the culture during the last part of the cell growth. In this case, add the dye after checking the culture OD. To acquire single-molecule resolution, generally you need to label sparsely, so only a small fraction of the molecules is fluorescently labeled. Too dense labeling results in too many labeled molecules in a small volume, which complicates resolving and tracking individual molecules. The time and dye concentration needed for sufficient labeling depends on the desired labeling ratio, which depends on the abundance of the protein to label. For example, 10 min labeling with 0.05 nM JF646 has been used for labeling abundant proteins such as histones and 2–3 h labeling with 5 nM JF646 has been used for imaging the low abundance transcription factor Gal4. Note that labeling with HALO dyes is only possible in yeast after deletion of the PDR5 gene and addition of the HALO tag to the gene of interest.\nPreparing Sample Using Agar Pad\nTiming: approximately 5 min\nFor details on this step, see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/209-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Sample Preparation Using Agar Imaging Pad\n(A) schematic and (B) photograph of sample prepared using an agar imaging pad.\nMeasure the OD600 of the yeast cultures using a spectrophotometer.\nIf the OD600 is below 0.2, grow cells for a few more hours.\nIf the OD600 is between 0.2 and 0.8, cells are ready for imaging, proceed to steps below.\nIf the OD600 is above 0.8, dilute culture to OD600 0.1–0.2 in prewarmed SC medium and grow them for two cell-cycles (around 180 min for strains with wildtype growth rates in glucose).",
    "When the cells are ready for imaging, spin 1 mL of yeast imaging culture (see previous step) at 3,824 × g for 1 min.\nRemove supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 4 μL of prewarmed SC medium with appropriate carbon source by shortly vortexing (see protocol above).\nTake one cleaned coverslip (stored in 70%, see above) and rinse it with 70% ethanol.\nDry the coverslip over a flame. Do not put the coverslip in the flame, as it is likely to break and flaming may lead to cloudy coverslips. Just hold the coverslip close to the flame such that it dries quickly but the ethanol is not set on fire. Alternatively, you can air dry the coverslips at the bench or in small oven (set to max 50°C).\nPlace coverslip in the Attofluor™ Cell Chamber.\nIf cleaned coverslips are not necessary, you can skip steps 5–6 and use a glass-bottom dish.\nPipet the entire volume (usually 4–10 μL) onto the coverslip.\nCut agar slab. This is easily done by stabbing a circle out of the agar imaging pad (see protocol above) using a 14 mL growth tube.\nPut agar slab on top of the yeast cells. Press down gently with your thumb. Be careful not to break the coverslip.\nOptionally, an additional coverslip can be placed on top of the agar slab to prevent drying of the sample during the experiment. This is not necessary if the microscope used has an imaging chamber in which the humidity is controlled but it can be especially useful for cells that are imaged for several hours or more.",
    "Optional: In case of labeling with a dye (such as the HALO dyes), this dye should be washed away before imaging. To do this, add a wash step after step 3: resuspend the cells in 1 mL prewarmed medium, spin cells for 1 min at 3,824 × g and remove supernatant. Then continue with steps 4–8 of the protocol above.\nPreparing Imaging Sample Using Concanavalin A\nTiming: approximately 25 min\nMeasure the OD600 of the yeast cultures using a spectrophotometer.\nIf the OD600 is below 0.2, grow cells for a few more hours.\nIf the OD600 is between 0.2 and 0.8, cells are ready for imaging, proceed to steps below.\nIf the OD600 is above 0.8, dilute culture to OD 0.1–0.2 in prewarmed SC medium and grow them for two cell-cycles (around 180 min for strains with wildtype growth rates in glucose).\nWhen the cells are ready for imaging, pipet 300 μL of yeast culture on a concanavalin A-coated coverslip (placed in a Attofluor™ Cell Chamber) or glass-bottom dish (see protocol above).\nIncubate 20 min at 30°C.\nRemove excess medium.\nWash cells by adding 300 μL of prewarmed medium onto the cells and removing the fluid.\nRepeat wash step.\nAdd 3 mL of prewarmed medium onto the cells. They are now ready for imaging.\nOptional: In case of labeling with a dye (such as the HALO dyes), this dye should be washed away before imaging. To do this, add a wash step after step 1: resuspend the cells in 1 mL prewarmed medium, spin cells for 1 min at 3,824 × g and remove supernatant. Resuspend cells in 300 μL of medium and continue with steps 2–7 of the protocol above.\nImage Acquisition\nTiming: 1–2 h",
    "In this section we describe in detail the microscope settings for experiments aimed at imaging of transcription using the PP7 or MS2 systems (Bertrand et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Chao et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Both these systems are based on genetic integration of stem loop sequences in the gene of interest, which, when transcribed, are immediately bound by fluorescently tagged coat proteins to allow visualization of transcription of a single gene inside living cells in real time. Although each individual experiment will require some optimization of these parameters, we outline settings that can be used as a starting point for two types of experiments: either to visualize and localize individual RNAs within the yeast cell or to follow transcription of an individual gene over an extended amount of time. We also discuss how to adjust these setting for imaging single proteins or single genomic DNA loci in the notes.\nTurn on the microscope, camera, and fluorescence light source (lasers or LED).\nTurn on the stage incubator and set at correct temperature. Let the temperature of the incubator stabilize (stabilization time depends on the incubator, for the stage-top incubator from OKO labs described above it is around 30 min).\nTurn on the stage controller.\nOpen the microscopy software.\nFocus on the cells using transmitted light.\nSwitch to fluorescence excitation.\nMove the stage to find a field of view with cells that are suitable for imaging. In general, depending on the size of the field of view of the camera, aim for 50–100 cells in an area of 100 × 100 μm. Avoid cells that have high levels of autofluorescence. Yeast cells show more autofluorescence during diauxic shift, so it is important to keep them in mid-log phase during growth and imaging.\nSet acquisition conditions in imaging software:",
    "Excitation power; for tracking of individual RNAs, maximum excitation power of the Lumencor source described above is used. For imaging gene transcription over time, use 0.1%–1% of the maximum power. See notes below.\nExposure time; for tracking of individual RNAs, use 30–50 ms. For imaging gene transcription, use 150 ms. See notes below.\nZ-stacks; for tracking individual RNAs, imaging of a single z-plane is required. For following gene transcription over time, multiple z-positions should be imaged as the transcription site may move in the z-dimension over time. The number of z-slices needed to cover the entire yeast nucleus depends on the numerical aperture of the microscope and the size of the yeast cells (ranging from 4 to 10 μm, depending on growth conditions and background strain). In general, we recommend 9–15 z-slices with 0.5 μm increments. For a 1.3 NA objective, this results in a slight undersampling of the imaging volume, but allows for proper localization of the transcription site within the cell. Decreasing the z-increment will lead to increased effects of photobleaching and phototoxicity which can be detrimental for the cells, especially when the cells are imaged for extended amounts of time.\nNumber of frames; depending on the stability of the fluorophore under the given excitation power and exposure time. For tracking individual RNAs, imaging around 100 frames gives sufficient insight in the RNA movement over time, while for imaging gene transcription, we aim for 240 frames.\nInterval between frames; for fast processes such as tracking of individual RNAs, continuous imaging with no dead time between the frames is needed. For slower processes such as imaging of gene transcription over time, an interval of 10–30 s is used. See notes.",
    "Autofocus: if available on the microscope, use the autofocus setting to prevent z-drift during the acquisition. This is most relevant for long acquisitions (more than 10 min).\nTurn on the fluorescence excitation and focus on the center of the cells.\nStart acquisition.",
    "Note: In general, choosing the optimal excitation power and exposure time requires a balance between good signal-to-noise and minimal photobleaching/phototoxicity. To a first approximation, each dye can emit a fixed number of photons before it photobleaches and turns dark (Lee et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Increasing excitation power or exposure time will lead to a larger number of photons per acquisition, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio, but limiting the time until photobleaching. In addition, (high amounts of) fluorescent light can cause light-induced damage to the cell (phototoxicity). Be aware of signs of phototoxicity: sudden uneven fluorescence signal, sudden termination of the fluorescence signal, termination of transcription, and termination of cell division. In addition, balancing excitation power and exposure time depends on the mobility of the fluorophore within the cell. In general, for relatively static spots, such as transcription sites or single genomic loci, use longer exposure times of 150–200 ms, which allows the use of lower excitation powers. However, for a mobile spots, such as diffusing single RNAs, long exposure times result in blurring caused by motion of the fluorophore during the image acquisition, so we recommend imaging using 10–50 ms exposure times. Single proteins can be visualized using laser excitation and inclined illumination (HILO) with an TIRF angle of around 60°–65° and laser powers around 10 μW to 10 mW. Diffusing proteins can be observed at 10–30 ms exposure, but it is also possible to only vizualize DNA-bound proteins with 500–1,000 ms exposure (for example for DNA dwell time measurements). Exposure times above 1,000 ms are not recommended, because cell movement results in blurring of the spot.",
    "Note: The interval between consecutive frames depends on the rate at which the biological process under study occurs. Because the total number of frames that a fluorophore can be imaged is limited by photobleaching, increasing the frame interval results in being able to follow the fluorophore for longer periods of time. For example, for fast processes such as tracking of diffusing proteins or individual RNA molecules, a high acquisition rate is needed. In this case, the frame interval can be set equal to the exposure time (i.e., no dead time between consecutive frames). Typically, an exposure time of 30–50 ms is needed to collect enough light to resolve the fluorophore of interest. In that case, the frame interval for such fast processes will thus be 30–50 ms. For slower processes such as DNA-protein dwell time measurements an interval of 200 ms to 5 s is suitable, and for gene transcription, an interval of 10–30 s is recommended. For even slower processes, such as following the yeast cell cycle, a time interval of around 5 min can be used.",
    "Note: If the sample has been prepared on a concanavalin A-coated dish (rather than an agar slab), it is possible to add drugs or compounds during imaging. Examples of this could be adding galactose to drive expression of a protein under control of the GAL1-10 promoter, or by adding compounds for rapid depletion or degradation, such as addition of rapamycin for the anchor-away system (Haruki et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) or auxin for the AID system (Nishimura et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). For addition of such compounds, place the sample on the microscope stage without covering the imaging dish with the lid. At the moment of drug addition, gently open the microscope chamber and slowly add the compound using a micropipette. Preferably, add roughly equal volume as the volume already in the dish, to ensure good mixing and to prevent gradients or high local concentration. For example, add 1.5 mL of a 2× concentrated drug diluted in media to 1.5 mL of media. It may be necessary to adjust the focus of the microscope after drug addition. Alternatively, some stage-top incubator systems allow for drug addition via an injection lid.\nImage Analysis\nTiming: depending on experimental design",
    "In order to obtain quantitative information from the acquired images, further analysis of these images is necessary. In general, the exact analysis pipeline will depend on the biological question and the application used. Basic principles behind image analysis are described extensively in (Waters, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]). Image processing and quantification can be performed using the software package Fiji, which provides intuitive implementations of most common image processing tasks, as well as the possibility to develop macros for automation and scripting of the tasks necessary for a variety of imaging applications (Schindelin et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). For analyzing transcription data obtained with the PP7 or MS2 systems, an analysis pipeline will consist of several steps:\nMaking a maximum intensity projection. This can be done using Fiji.\nSegmentation of cells and nuclei. This can be performed using CellProfiler (Lamprecht et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]), which provides an intuitive, GUI-based pipeline for image segmentation.\nDetection and tracking individual RNAs or the transcription site over time. For tracking of individual RNAs, existing tracking and quantifaction packages such as the TrackMate package (Tinevez et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]), which is available through Fiji or alternative approaches such as described and compared in (Chenouard et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) are sufficient. Tracking of single proteins and dwell time measurements can be done with Matlab software such as MatTrack (Mazza et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Following and tracking the transcription site (as a measure of real-time gene transcription) over time is more challenging, as it requires appropriate gap-filling during periods of time when the gene is off. Typically, it is necessary to develop custom-written software for this purpose."
