    "1. Two-dimensional (2D) Cell Culture\nCommercially obtain tumor cell line HCC827 (DSMZ). Culture the lung adenocarcinoma cell line HCC827 (EGFR mutated, KRAS wild-type) in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 20% FCS. Change medium every 2 - 3 days. Split the cells twice a week. Cells are used until passage 20 is reached.\nCommercially obtain tumor cell line A549 (DSMZ). Culture the lung carcinoma cell line A549 (EGFR wild-type, KRAS mutated) in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FCS. Perform the culture as stated above. Cells are used until passage 20 is reached.\nTest the cells regularly (every 4 - 6 weeks) for contaminations such as mycoplasma contaminations.\nCulturing A549 or HCC827 cells on glass coverslips\n\t\nPlace 1 sterile glass coverslip in each well of a 24-well plate using a tweezer.\nSeed 50,000 tumor cells of both cell lines in a volume of 500 µl in the wells with the glass coverslips, respectively.\nCulture the cells until they reach a confluency of 70% under standard culture conditions (37 °C; 5% CO2). During this time, aspirate the old medium using a Pasteur pipette and add 500 µl fresh medium every 2 - 3 days of culture.\n2. Generation of Tumor Test Systems on a Biological Collagen Scaffold\nStatic Culture Conditions\nGenerate the decellularized small-intestine-submucosa + mucosa (SISmuc) and fix it between two metal rings, the so-called cell crowns, as described in a previous publication25.\nSeed 100,000 cells of either HCC827 or A549 cells in a total volume of 500 µl onto the side of the former lumen of the gut fixed in cell crowns.\nAllow tumor cells to adhere for 2 hr at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Add 1 ml medium inside the cell crown and 1 ml outside.",
    "Culture the tumor model under static conditions at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in the incubator for 14 days. Change culture medium every 2 - 3 days. Therefore, aspirate the medium using a Pasteur pipette and pipette 1 ml fresh RPMI with the appropriate amount of FCS (A549: 10%, HCC827: 20%) inside the cell crown and 1.5 ml of the same medium outside.\nDynamic Culture Conditions\nSet up the tumor test system with the decellularized matrix inside the cell crowns and cell seeding as described under subsection 2.1.1 to 2.1.3.\nCulture the tumor model under static conditions 37 °C, 5% CO2 in the incubator for 3 days.\nAssemble the autoclaved bioreactor and insert the seeded SISmuc as published previously 25.\nPipette 45 ml RPMI with the appropriate amount of FCS (A549: 10%, HCC827: 20%) into the flask and connect the needle-free sampling device to the tubing system between the bioreactor and the medium flask.\nPlace the bioreactor in the incubator, connect it to the pump and culture the tumor model for additional 14 days with a constant medium flow (3 ml/min) at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nChange the entire culture medium after 7 days. For that, move the bioreactor from the incubator under a laminar flow hood. Aspirate the medium in the media flask using a Pasteur pipette. Lift up the bioreactor while aspirating to get rid of the medium in the tubing system. Pipette 45 ml fresh medium into the flask. Place the bioreactor back into the incubator and connect it to the pump.\n3. Treatment of the Static Tumor Model with Gefitinib\nCulture the tumor model as described in section 2.1.",
    "At day 11 of culture, prepare RPMI/FCS with 1 µM gefitinib (2.5 ml for each cell crown). Aspirate the old medium from the wells using a Pasteur pipette and add 1 ml of prepared RPMI/FCS/gefitinib inside the cell crown and 1.5 ml of the same medium outside.\n\tNOTE: The thawed gefitinib stock solution can be stored at 4 °C for one week.\nChange the medium at day 13 as described under subsection 3.2.\n4. Stimulation of the Static Tumor Model with TGF-beta-1 for EMT Induction\nCulture the tumor model as described in section 2.1.\nAt day 3 of culture, prepare RPMI/FCS with 2 ng/ml TGF-beta-1 with carrier (2.5 ml for each cell crown). Aspirate the old medium from the wells using a Pasteur pipette and add 1 ml of prepared RPMI/FCS/TGF-beta-1 inside the cell crown and 1.5 ml of the same medium outside. Change medium supplemented with TGF-beta-1 every 2 - 3 days until day 14, as described under 4.2.\n5. Read-outs\nTaking Samples for ELISA Measurements\nTake samples from the supernatants of static (section 2.1) and dynamic (section 2.2) culture during treatment with gefitinib (section 3) at days 11-14 of culture as indicated in Figure 2. Additionally, take a sample prior to treatment (T0).\nUnder static culture conditions, take 100 µl sample from the inside of the cell crown. Under dynamic culture conditions, screw the syringe on the sampling device and take 1 ml medium out of the bioreactor system. Store all collected supernatants at -80 °C until the ELISA is performed.\nM30-ELISA for Apoptosis Quantification\nTo quantify the apoptosis in the supernatants perform the cell death assay according to manufacturer's instructions. Allow all reagents to reach RT before performing the assay.",
    "Vortex all reagents. Dissolve the wash tablet in 500 ml fresh deionized water. Dilute HRP Conjugate with 9.2 ml of Conjugate Dilution Buffer and mix. Pipette 25 µl of standard or sample per well.\nAdd 75 µl of the diluted HRP Conjugate solution per well. Cover the plate and incubate it on a shaker for 4 hr at RT. Wash the plate manually, 5 times with 250 µl of prepared wash solution.\nAdd 200 µl of 3,3',5,5'-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate to each well. Incubate in darkness at RT for 20 min.

    "NOTE: See table of Material and Equipment's for preparing of citrate buffer.\nTransfer the slides to the washing buffer (0.5 M PBS buffer + 0.5% Tween), circle sections with a PAP pen to minimize the required volume for staining solutions and place the slides in a moisture chamber.\nBlock tissue sections with 5% serum from the host species of the secondary antibodies used in subsection 5.3.4.6 for 20 min at RT.\nRemove blocking serum by gently tapping the slides to a paper tissue and apply the primary antibody to the encircled sections in a dilution according to the manufacturer's instruction (rabbit anti Ki67 1:100, rabbit anti vimentin 1:100, mouse anti pan-cytokeratin 1:100). Incubate O/N at 4 °C. For double-staining, primary antibodies from different host species must be used.\nCarefully wash off unbound antibody with washing buffer three times for 5 min.\nFor detection of specific antigen-antibody bindings, apply secondary antibodies in the dilution 1:400 to the sections and incubate at RT for 1 hr.\nWash off unbound antibody with washing buffer three times for 5 min.\nMount the slides with an aqueous medium containing DAPI to counterstain nuclei and let them dry O/N.\nImmunofluorescent Staining of 2D Cultured Cells\nRemove PBS and cover the seeded glass cover slips with 0.2% Triton-X100 in PBS for 5 min for permeabilization. Wash the glass cover slips with washing buffer (0.5 M PBS buffer + 0.5 % Tween) for 5 min.\nPerform steps 5.3.4.3 to 5.3.4.7. Execute all steps in the well-plate on a rocking platform and remove reagents by inverting the plate.\nFor mounting, spot a drop of aqueous medium containing DAPI to counterstain nuclei onto an uncoated glass slide and transfer the cover slip to it with the cells facing the mounting medium using forceps.
