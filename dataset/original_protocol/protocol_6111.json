    "Design the primers used for iHTGTSChoose Cas9-generated on-target site DSB as the “bait” to capture other genome-wide “prey” DSBs. To be compatible with 2 x 150 bp Hiseq sequencing, biotinylated primer for LAM-PCR was designed to bind 150 bp upstream of Cas9 binding site; nested primer was designed annealling to the downstream of the biotinylated primer about 90 bp away from the cut site. (Figure 1, Table 1)Note: Avoid designing primers at DNA repetitive region. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190429/20190429011142_4355.jpgFigure 1. Primer design for iHTGTS. The red arrow indicates the Cas9 on-target cutting site. The blue arrow indicates the nested primer and purple indicates the biotinylated primer. The distance to the cutting site is shown below.Table 1. The sequences of primers and bridge adapters. The Phor indicates the phosphorylation. MID indicates the index base for data demultiplex. REDPRIMER indicates nested primer, which varies between different loci.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190429/20190429011309_6517.jpgExtract Genomic DNA (gDNA)Forty-eight hours after transfecting HEK293T cells with the Cas9 plasmids, collect 107 transfected HEK293T cells (we have also tried K562, HCT116 and U2OS, all work well) in a 1.5 ml tube and add 500 µl cell lysis buffer. Incubate the tube in Thermomixer at 56 °C, 500 x g for 10-18 h. Note: Protease K solution should be added into lysis buffer just before use (10 ng/ml final concentration). Add 500 µl isopropyl and mix thoroughly till you can see a white flocculent DNA pellet.Using a pipet to transfer the pellet into another 1.5 ml tube with 1 ml 70% ethanol. Centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 5 min.Discard the supernatant. Centrifuge again and deplete residual 70% ethanol. Add 500 µl TE and incubate the tube in Thermomixer at 56 °C, 500 x g for at least 2 h.",
    "Note: Adjust the volume of added TE to make sure the DNA concentration not less than 200 ng/µl. Quantify the DNA using NanoDrop. The A260/A280 should be higher than 1.8.Recommend 20 µg gDNA for iHTGTS library construction.Fragment gDNA by sonicationAdd 20 µg gDNA into a PCR tube. Set Covaris with the following parameters: PIP = 50 watts, DF = 30%, CPB = 200, Time = 60 s.After sonication, take 200 ng DNA for 1% agarose page. The range of the DNA smear should be at 0.2-2 kb with a peak at 0.75 kb. (Figure 2)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190429/20190429011452_1400.jpgFigure 2. DNA smear pattern after sonication. The smear ranges from 300 bp to 2 kb with the peak at about 750 bp.LAM-PCRSet up the reaction in 4 x 50 µl PCR tubes as following (DNA template for each PCR reaction can be 1-10 µg):imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190429/20190429011737_8292.pngSet up the PCR program: 95 °C for 2 min[95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1.5 min] (80 cycles) 72 °C for 2 min10 °C foreverDeplete surplus biotin primer using AMPure XP beadsAdd 50 µl AMPure XP beads into each PCR tube, mix gently and incubate the tubes at RT for 5 min.Note: This step aims to remove fragments less than 300 bp; the volume of the beads can be upscaled according to different batches. Note: All the following Steps (D3b-D3f) are operated at RT. Put the tubes on an 8-well magnet stand for 5 min.Remove the supernatant, add 200 µl 70% ethanol. After standing for 30 s, remove the supernatant.Repeat the Step D3c.Add 50 µl dH2O, mix the beads completely using a pipette and incubate at RT for 2 min.Put the tubes on the magnet for 2 min and pool the supernatants (about 200 µl) into a new 1.5 ml tube.",
    "Streptavidin beads bindingAdd 50 µl 5 M NaCl, 2.5 µl 0.5 M EDTA into the PCR product from the last step. Add 30 µl streptavidin beads and rotate for 4 h at RT. (The streptavidin beads should be washed twice with 1x B&W buffer before use)Put the beads against the 1.5 ml tube magnet stand and remove the supernatant. Wash the beads three times each using 400 µl 1x B&W buffer. Wash the beads with 400 µl dH2O and then resuspend the beads in 42.4 µl dH2O.On-beads ligation for bridge adapterimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191203/20191203194509_4172.jpgSet the reaction in a 1.5 ml tube in a rotator and ligate overnight at RT.Nested PCRAdd 80 µl 2x B&W buffer and 160 µl 1x B&W buffer. Put the beads against the 1.5 ml tube magnet stand and remove the supernatant. Wash the beads using 400 µl 1x B&W buffer three times and 400 µl dH2O once. Resuspend the beads in 80 µl dH2O.Set up the PCR reaction in 2x PCR tubes as following:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20191203/20191203210607_9701.jpgSet up the PCR program: 95 °C for 5 min [95 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min] (15 cycles)72 °C for 10 min10 °C foreverRecycle the PCR products using AMpure XP beads as described in Step D3. Elute the PCR products with 35 µl dH2O for each PCR tube. Gather the PCR products together and measure the concentration.Note: This step aims to remove DNA fragments less than 500 bp, upscale the volume of the beads according to different batches.Enzyme Blocking (Optional)Add 8 µl 10x enzyme buffer, 10 U blocking enzyme, incubate at 37 °C for 1 h or longer.Purify the DNA with GeneJET column, elute with 70 µl dH2O, and check the concentration.
