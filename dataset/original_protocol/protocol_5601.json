    "Generation of infectious subviral particles (ISVPs)Propagate and purify reovirus virions as previously described (Berard and Coombs, 2009; Kobayashi et al., 2010). Using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer, determine particle concentration by measuring the optical density of the purified virus stocks at 260 nm (OD260; 1 unit at OD260 = 2.1 x 1012 particles/ml) (Smith et al., 1969).In 1 tube of an 8-well tube strip, dilute 2 x 1011 virions into 90 µl of ice cold VB (see Recipes).Add 10 µl of ice cold 2 mg/ml TLCK-treated chymotrypsin (see Recipes) to the diluted virus. Mix by pipetting up and down 3-4 times.Note: For an undigested control, substitute 10 µl of ice cold VB for 10 µl of TLCK-treated chymotrypsin.Incubate the reaction for 20 min at 32 °C in a thermal cycler.Note: Under these conditions, σ3 is degraded (Joklik, 1972; Borsa et al., 1973a) and µ1 is cleaved (Nibert and Fields, 1992; Chandran et al., 1999).Following digestion, quench chymotrypsin activity by the addition of 1 µl of 100 mM PMSF (see Recipes). Mix by pipetting up and down 3-4 times.Incubate the reaction for 20 min on ice.To confirm that ISVPs are generated, run 2 x 1010 particles per lane on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide mini gel. Run the gel for 40-45 min at 200 V constant.Visualize the protein bands by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (see Data analysis, Figure 1).Store ISVPs on ice, and use within 2-3 h for hemolysis experiments.Preparation of bovine red blood cells (RBCs)Perform all steps on ice or at 4 °C.Transfer 1 ml of citrated bovine calf blood to a microcentrifuge tube.Note: Citrated bovine calf blood should be used within 2 weeks of the draw date.Pellet the RBCs by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min.Note: RBCs are the source of membranes for hemolysis experiments.Aspirate and discard the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the RBCs in 1 ml of ice cold PBSMg (see Recipes). Mix by gently pipetting up and down.Repeat Steps B3-B5 until the supernatant remains clear after pelleting.Resuspend the washed RBCs in ice cold PBSMg at a 30% (vol/vol) concentration. Mix by gently flicking the side of the tube.Note: Estimate the RBC pellet volume by using the volume markers on the microcentrifuge tube.Store RBCs on ice, and use immediately for hemolysis experimentsISVP-induced hemolysis assayIn separate microcentrifuge tubes, assemble the following reactions on ice:33.3 µl VB + 3.7 µl 30% RBCs (0% hemolysis control)30.3 µl VB + 3.7 µl 30% RBCs + 3 µl 10% TX-100 (100% hemolysis control, see Recipes)3.3 µl VB + 3.7 µl 30% RBCs + 30 µl ISVPsMix the reactions by gently flicking the side of the tubes.Incubate the reactions for 1 h (T3D reovirus) or for 2 h (T1L reovirus) at 37 °C in a water bath.Note: Under these conditions, ISVP-to-ISVP* conversion is induced (Chandran et al., 2002; Sarkar and Danthi, 2010) and the µ1-derived pore forming peptides are released (Nibert et al., 1991; Chandran et al., 2002; Odegard et al., 2004; Nibert et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005; Agosto et al., 2006; Ivanovic et al., 2008).Place the reactions on ice for 20 min.Pellet intact RBCs by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 min.Note: This step should be performed at 4 °C.Transfer 20 µl of each supernatant to individual wells of a 96-well plate.Dilute each transferred supernatant with 80 µl of VB. Mix by pipetting up and down 3-4 times.To quantify the amount of hemoglobin released (i.e., RBC lysis), measure the absorbance (A) of the diluted supernatants at 405 nm using a microplate reader. A values are recorded on SoftMax Pro software.Calculate the percent hemolysis (see Data analysis)."
