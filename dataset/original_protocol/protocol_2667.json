BMP4 is an essential factor for mesoderm formation.3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] The culture medium of instructed mESCs is changed to aPSM differentiation medium to prompt differentiation towards aPSM-like fate (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). Both chemicals (LDN193189 and Rspo3) used in aPSM medium can induce the instructed mESCs to activate Pax3 expression. Approximately ∼30–40% Pax3-GFP positive cells are obtained by exposure to aPSM medium that can be FACS-sorted based on GFP expression (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Then, the medium is switched to a HIFLR medium supplemented with hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), insulin growth factor 1 (IGF-1), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), LDN193189, and Rspo3 for additional 48 h and Pax3-GFP positive can be FACS sorted (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B). At this time, cells express Pax7 protein as shown1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2322-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Induction and FACS-isolation of mESCs-derived Pax3-GFP+ cells\n(A) Bright-field and fluorescence microscopy images of naïve mESCs and mESCs-derived Pax3-GFP+ cells at different stages of induced differentiation. Bar, 100 μm\n(B) FACS plot of mESCs-derived Pax3-GFP+ cells at day 6 (aPSM cells) and day 8 (HIFLR cells) of differentiation.\nDifferentiation of mESCs into MPs\nTiming: ∼12 days\nNote: To ensure efficient mESCs differentiation, it is essential that mESCs are not cultured for more than 10 passages. mESCs should form round-shaped colonies, and cell confluency should be 50–60%. All differentiation experiments are done in 6-well plates (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nThaw mESCs,",
    "Plate mESCs on gelatin-coated 6-well plates.\nMaintain mESCs in maintenance medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nPassage the cells twice before starting differentiation.\nDay 0: Remove the culture medium and wash mESCs once with 1 mL PBS.\nRemove PBS and add 200–300 μL trypsin for 3–5 min at 37°C.\nAdd 1 mL instructing medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) and gently pipette to detach the cells.\nCollect mESCs into a 15 mL falcon tube with 3 mL instructing medium.\nCentrifuge cells at 160–185 × g for 5 min at 25°C.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL instructing medium and count them.\nDetermine cell number using Cellometer Vision according to the manufacturer’s instructions (http://www.nexcelom.com/Literature/Literature_Cellometer_Vision.pdf[href=http://www.nexcelom.com/Literature/Literature_Cellometer_Vision.pdf]).\nPlate 140–150K cells per well of gelatin-coated 6-well plates (total volume for each well is 2 mL of instructing medium).\nCulture the cells for two days.\nDay 2: Carefully remove the instructing medium, wash the cells with 1 mL of 1× PBS.\nNote: Cells at this stage (day 2) detach easily. Wash the cells with 1 mL 1× PBS carefully and avoid shaking the plate.\nRemove PBS and add 2 mL aPSM differentiation medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) to each well.\nContinue culturing the cells for four days in aPSM medium.\nDay 6: ∼30% GFP-positive cells should appear (see Section PAX3-GFP-positive cells isolation using FACS[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.3], step 17).\nRemove aPSM medium and add 2 mL HIFLR medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) to each well.\nKeep HIFLR medium for additional two days.\nDay 8: GFP-positive cells number should increase to ∼50% and cells can be prepared for FACS sorting (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A and 1B).\nPAX3-GFP-positive cells isolation using FACS\nTiming: ∼1 day",
    "This section provides detailed description for sorting Pax3-GFP-positive cells at day 6 (aPSM cells, step 14) and day 8 (HIFLR cells, step 16) of differentiation for further analyses (RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, single cell RNA-seq, single cell ATAC-seq and single cell multiome analysis).\nOn the sorting day (step 14 or step 16), add 300–500 μL of trypsin to each well for 5–10 min at 37°C.\nGently pipette cells every 1–2 min until cells detach.\nNote: The differentiated cells at this stage are hard to dissociate, they easily form clumps and aggregates. For better dissociation, keep the trypsin for longer time (∼10 min) and gently pipette the cells with the trypsin every 1–2 min until they detach from the plate.\nAdd 1 mL of differentiation medium (aPSM medium if the sort at day 6 or HIFLR medium if at day 8).\nTransfer the cells to 15 mL falcon tube and add 5 mL medium to the falcon tube.\nSpin at 160 × g for 3 min and discard supernatant carefully.\nResuspend the pellet with an appropriate amount (500 μL–2000 μL, depending on the pellet size) of differentiation medium.\nNote: To avoid clumps during FACS sorting, add 1 mM EDTA to differentiation medium.\nTransfer the cells through a 40 μm cell strainer sitting on a 15 mL falcon tube or through polystyrene round-bottom tube with cell-strainer cap (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nTake cells to FACS on ice.\nSort by gating for GFP (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). About 200,000–300,000 GFP positive cells can be obtained from a 6 well plate.\nAfter FACS, collect cells by spinning them down at 210–305 × g for 5–8 min.\nDiscard supernatant, wash the cells twice with 1 mL of 1× PBS.\nStore pellets or proceed for further analysis.\nIsolation of somitic cells from genetically labeled Pax7+/Cre; Rosa26YFP/+ embryos",
    "This section provides a detailed protocol to harvest, dissect, dissociate and FACS-isolate somitic cells, including MPs, from genetically labeled Pax7+/Cre; Rosa26YFP/+ embryos, in which somitic cells including MPs are labeled with YFP.\nEmbryo collection\nTiming: ∼0.5 h\nFill a bucket with ice, fill 4 petri dishes (100 × 15 mm) and one 12-well culture plate with 1× PBS and put them on ice. Sanitize dissection tools (2 scissors, 2 forceps) with 70% ethanol spray and Kimwipes.\nEuthanize a pregnant mouse (at day 12 after a positive plug) by CO2 asphyxia according to Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) regulations.\nPosition the mouse belly up on a clean paper towel; spray the belly with 70% ethanol and make a 1 cm cut on the belly skin with scissors; pull the skin bidirectionally toward the head and the toe to expose the sac containing a string of embryos.\nMake a cut on the body wall of abdominal cavity and carefully remove the whole string of embryos and transfer them in a petri dish placed on ice.\nPeel off each uterus wall to release each embryo into the dish. An E12.5 embryo is covered with a very thin layer of amniotes and vascularized yolk sac. Tear these membranes off to expose the embryo, then cut off the umbilical cord from placenta.\nRinse all embryos in a new petri dish with 1× PBS, then allocate each embryo in one well of a 12-well culture plate.\nScreen embryos under the fluorescent dissecting microscope to identify Pax7+/Cre; Rosa26YFP/+ embryos; mark the wells with YFP-positive embryos.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2322-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. FACS isolation of YFP+ somitic cells",
    "(A) A representative E12.5 Pax7+/Cre; Rosa26YFP/+ embryo with orientation index; A: anterior, P: posterior, D: dorsal, V: ventral. The blue dashed line marks the boundary between spinal cord and somites; the yellow dashed line marks the axial level of dissection. Somites ventral to the blue line, posterior (caudal) to the yellow line were dissected out in each embryo.\n(B) FACS plot of YFP+ cells isolated from somites of Pax7+/Cre; Rosa26YFP/+ embryos.\nNote: At this embryonic stage, Pax7 is also expressed in the dorsal neural tube. Under the fluorescent microscope, one can clearly see the YFP expressing spinal cord and bilaterally situated somites with striped expression pattern of YFP (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nYFP-positive embryo dissection\nTiming: ∼1 h\nTake one YFP-positive embryo, place it in a new petri dish with 1× PBS.\nEviscerate the embryo’s abdominal cavity and thoracic cavity, flatten the embryo in the dish with belly down and back up.\nCut the embryo approximately by half through the trunk region, between the two pairs of limbs; take the posterior half for the next step dissection.\nNote: In this study, we aimed to use relatively nascent somites harboring undifferentiated MPs. Therefore, we isolated ∼ 25 pairs of somites in the posterior (caudal) half of the embryo.\nOn the flattened posture, one can clearly see the boundary between spinal cord and lateral somites (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Use fine tipped forceps to carefully carve out the YFP-positive spinal cord and discard it.\nPut the rest of the tissue including YFP-positive somites in a 1.5 mL tube with 250 μL cold 1× PBS, place the tube on ice.\nRepeat steps 36–40 to finish the dissection of all YFP-positive embryos, each embryo in one 1.5 mL tube. Mince the tissue in each tube by scissors one by one.",
    "Note: It takes approximately 10 min to dissect one embryo. Normally one litter has ∼ 4–6 YFP-positive embryos, so it takes approximately 1 h to complete this step.\nTissue dissociation\nTiming: ∼1 h\nAdd 250 μL Embryo dissociation medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) to each tube and incubate in a 33°C water bath for 20 min. While incubating, use a 1 mL tip to pipet the tissue up and down to help dissociation.\nWhen the tissue is completely dissociated, add 500 μL somite sorting medium (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) to stop the digestion.\nMove the dissociated tissue into a 15 mL falcon tube and resuspend the tissue with 10 mL of somite sorting medium.\nFilter each resuspended tissue through a 40 μm cell strainer sitting on a 50 mL falcon tube.\nCentrifuge (∼210 × g) 50 mL Falcon tubes to spin down cells. A small pellet should be seen on the bottom of each tube.\nCarefully remove the supernatant from each tube by aspirating through a 2 mL aspirating pipette.\nResuspend the pellet with 500 μL somite sorting medium, then filter through a 5 mL Falcon tube with a strainer top (40 μm).\nNote: Coat the strainer top with 100 μL FBS before filtering to help the cells dropping.\nCell sorting by FACS\nTiming: ∼2 h\nFACS-isolate cells by gating on GFP channel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nFrom each embryo, approximately 10–15% sorted cells are YFP-positive (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B); approximately 100,000 to 150,000 YFP-positive cells were collected per embryo.\nStore cells in −80°C freezer or use them immediately for RNA extraction."
