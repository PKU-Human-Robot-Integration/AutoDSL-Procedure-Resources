The initial steps are illustrated in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1615-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Illustration of the initial steps to mechanically disrupt and enzymatically digest human liver tissue into a single-cell suspension\nBefore starting, all reagents and equipment should be prepared in advance to the appropriate volume, concentration and temperature described in this protocol. For optimal results, tissue samples should be processed within 6 h of surgical retrieval, refer to troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] for further details. If not processed immediately after surgical removal from the patient, liver tissue samples should be stored at 4°C in UW solution prior to processing.\nCritical: Tissue samples must not be allowed to ‘dry out’ at any time during this protocol as this will impact cell viability. Where possible, always dissect tissue in solution.\nRemove liver tissue from its preservation solution and dissect, using blunt-ended scissors and forceps, into sections no greater than 3.5 × 3.5 × 3.5 cm (43 cm3; max weight: ∼30 g). Reserve preservation solution for step 5. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] is a useful reference guide to liver tissue sizes and corresponding weights.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1615-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Representative examples of liver resections used for processing\n(A and B) Example resection weighing. (A) 7.6 g (combined weight) and (B) 22.6 g, shown from 2 different angles.\n(C) Representative liver resection dissected accurately to represent 6 cm3 (2 × 2 × 1.5 cm), weighing 3.6 g.\nPlace each 43 cm3 (∼30 g) section of liver into a 100 mL universal beaker and top up with 25 mL pre-warmed enzyme digestion buffer.\nNote: If final IHL yield is low, refer to troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].",
    "Dissect the larger (43 cm3/∼30 g) section of liver into small pieces no greater than 5 × 5 × 5 mm (125 mm3) using blunt-ended scissors against the side of the beaker (rough size of pieces depicted in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Once chopped, incubate at 37°C for 30 min, swirl the beaker every 10 min.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1615-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Dissected liver section in small pieces of no greater than 5 × 5 × 5 mm (125 mm3) in a 100 mL universal beaker containing pre-warmed enzyme digestion buffer (step 3)\nCritical: Tissue must be incubated with enzymes to allow for adequate IHL retrieval. Incubations longer than 30 min may impact surface expression of certain markers. If multiple beakers are being used to process large volumes of tissue, we recommend proceeding to step 6 one beaker at a time and placing remaining beakers in the fridge after the initial 30 min incubation to stop enzymatic digestion. Alternatively, consider staggering the enzyme incubations to space out the following processing steps.\nDuring incubation, place a 70 μm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL conical tube and rinse with 1 mL 1× HBSS−/−.\nFilter strain the liver preservation solution that was set aside in step 1. Once filtered reserve until step 12.\nCritical: To maintain aseptic conditions, the following steps need to be carried out in a Class II Microbiological Safety Cabinet (MSC).\nAfter 30 min, transfer the enzyme-digested tissue and remaining enzyme digestion buffer into a gentleMACSTM C-tube (not exceeding the maximum volume of 10 mL / C-tube).\nPlace each C-tube on a gentleMACSTM tissue dissociator and run for one cycle using the mouse spleen program: m_spleen_01.01 (length: 50 s).\nNote: If a gentleMACSTM tissue dissociator is unavailable, proceed directly to step 8. For sustainability, C-tubes can be re-used after each cycle.",
    "Critical: When processing large or multiple samples (size > 43 cm3 or weight > 30 g), we recommend staggering the protocol at this point to ensure all timings are adhered to.\nPlace a 70 μm cell strainer on a new 50 mL conical tube and rinse with 1 mL 1× HBSS−/−. Pour the contents of each C-tube into the cell strainer, as shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. Rinse the cell strainer with 1 mL 1× HBSS−/− before pouring tissue.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1615-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. After gentleMACSTM dissociation, the C-tube contents are poured into 70-μm cell strainer placed on top of a 50 mL conical tube and grinded through using the flat end of a sterile syringe plunger and plenty of HBSS−/− (steps 8–9)\nGrind the remaining liver tissue through the cell strainer using the flat end of a sterile plunger from a 5 mL syringe. Wash the cell strainer with 1–2 mL 1× HBSS−/− regularly to prevent clogging and to help ease IHL through (refer to troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nNote: Take care not to damage the 70 μm cell strainer, replacing as required to prevent blocking of the filter. Discard any tough connective or fibrous tissue that builds up in the cell strainer as necessary.\nOnce the 50 mL conical tube reaches a volume of 25 mL, remove the cell strainer and top up with a further 25 mL HBSS−/− to prevent over-concentration of cells leading to loss of cell recovery and decreased viability.\nNote: Centrifuge cells within 10 min of grinding through a 70 μm cell strainer to prevent further enzymatic digestion.\nRepeat steps 6–10 until all tissue is processed and IHL liberated. (If poor final IHL yield, there could be an issue with the tissue drying out or with the amount of time spent in enzyme digestion buffer, refer to troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).",
    "Note: Alternatively, from this point, the cell suspension is suitable for the isolation of HSC and/or KC, rather than IHL, using our previous published protocol. For the full step-by-step method, please refer to Cossarizza et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1].\nRemoval of hepatocytes\nTiming: 0.5 h\nThe following steps provide information on how to remove hepatocytes from the cell suspension to enrich for viable IHL. These steps are illustrated in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]. Contaminating hepatocytes will negatively impact the viability of lymphocytes in suspension.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1615-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Illustration of the steps required to remove hepatocytes from the initial cell suspension obtained after mechanical and enzymatic digestion of liver tissue\nCentrifuge the single-cell suspension at 700 g using a swing bucket rotor for 15 min at room temperature (R.T.; acceleration/deceleration: 9/9).\nDiscard the supernatant using a 25 mL serological pipette.\nNote: If necessary, first harvest the layer of fat (as illustrated in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) floating on top of the conical tube with a Pasteur pipette and discard. Continue to remove and discard the remaining supernatant. For problems resulting from contamination of sample with fat, refer to troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nCritical: Take care not to disturb cell pellets at this stage as they may be loose (do not pour off supernatant).\nVortex the remaining cell pellet and resuspend in 20 mL 30% Percoll® (v/v) in a 50 mL conical tube.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1615-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. A representative example viewed from different angles of the fat layer floating at the top of the conical tube following centrifugation at step 12\nNote: Multiple cell pellets can be combined into one 50 mL conical tube before resuspending in 20 mL of 30% Percoll® (v/v) solution following vortexing.\nCentrifuge the Percoll®-IHL solution at 800 g using a swing bucket rotor for 15 min at R.T. (acceleration/deceleration: 9/9).",
    "Remove the top layer of contaminating hepatocytes using a sterile Pasteur pipette and discard (refer to Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). Continue to gently remove the remaining supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet. For difficulty removing the hepatocyte layer, refer to troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1615-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. A representative example of the top layer of contaminating hepatocytes to be removed after centrifugation of 30% Percoll®-IHL solution (steps 15 and 16)\nThe top layer of hepatocytes is removed and discarded prior to downstream purification of IHL from the cell pellet.\nCritical: Take care not to disturb cell pellets as they may be loose (do not pour off supernatant).\nNote: Due to the mechanical disruption, the hepatocytes at this stage are non-viable and, therefore, cannot be isolated in parallel to IHL using this protocol.\nVortex the cell pellet and resuspend in 25 mL of 1× HBSS−/−.\nNote: At this stage, cell pellets can be combined into 50 mL conical tubes before resuspending in 25 mL of 1× HBSS−/− solution.\nIsolation of intrahepatic leukocytes (IHL)\nTiming: 1 h\nThe following steps provide information on how to isolate IHL suitable for short-term primary cell culture or ex vivo phenotypic and functional characterization by flow cytometry (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1615-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Illustration of the final steps required to isolate viable IHL from human tissue samples after the mechanical and enzymatic digestion of liver tissue and hepatocyte removal using a 30% Percoll gradient\nGently layer 25 mL of the IHL single-cell suspension over 12.5 mL of Pancoll in a new 50 mL conical tube.\nNote: Ensure pipetting is very slow and care is taken to not disturb the layers.\nCentrifuge the layered samples at 800 g using a swing bucket rotor for 20 min at R.T. (acceleration/deceleration: low / OFF).",
    "Critical: To maintain delicate layering of cells, ensure centrifuge acceleration and deceleration is set to low / OFF.\nHarvest the IHL layer at the interface of the 1× HBSS−/− and Pancoll gradient, using a Pasteur pipette, and transfer to a new 50 mL conical tube (refer to Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9] to identify layer of interest).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1615-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. A representative example of the IHL cell layer after density centrifugation using a Pancoll gradient (from step 19)\nThe layer indicated by the black arrow contains the IHL and is collected using a clean Pasteur pipette, prior to further processing (step 20).\nOnce carefully removed, dilute the IHL in RPMI-1640 to a final volume of 50 mL.\nCentrifuge the diluted IHL solution at 700 g using swing buckets for 15 min at R.T. (acceleration/deceleration: 9/9).\nAspirate and discard the remaining supernatant with a 25 mL serological pipette without disturbing the cell pellet.\nResuspend the IHL pellet in an appropriate volume of complete RPMI-1640 for cell counting (for poor recovery refer to troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nOptional: If the IHL suspension is heavily contaminated with red blood cells (RBC), an RBC lysis step can be performed (refer to troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nNote: Isolated IHL are best counted with an automated cell counter to prevent inclusion of cellular debris. IHL can also be counted by eye with a haemocytometer and using trypan blue dye to differentiate dead cells.\nPause point: Following resuspension of the pellet, samples may be kept on ice or at 4°C. Alternatively IHL can be frozen down.",
    "Purified IHL can be used immediately for culture or downstream analysis, or can be frozen for long-term storage. For freezing, centrifuge the isolated IHL suspension (700 g, 15 min, R.T.) and resuspend the resulting pellet in freezing media (refer to materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section) and aliquot into cryovials. For optimal cell recovery, place cryovials into a Mr.FrostyTM freezing container in the −80°C freezer and transfer to liquid nitrogen after 24 h for long-term storage.\nNote: For optimal freezing, we recommend a minimum concentration of 5 × 106 cells per 500 μL of freezing media and a maximum of 20 × 106 cells per 1 mL of freezing media. Mr.FrostyTM ensures a temperature drop of 1°C per minute, minimizing the risk of intracellular ice crystal formation and cell death.\nStaining of leukocytes for flow cytometry\nThe following steps provide information on how to examine IHL for phenotype and functional characterization by multi-parameter flow cytometry.\nCritical: Switch on flow cytometer before beginning staining protocol to allow lasers to warm up and equilibrate for a minimum of 20 min before use.\nNote: If performing this analysis from frozen samples, we recommend thawing IHL using pre-warmed 1× HBSS+/+ media supplemented with 0.002% DNase I to remove remaining DMSO. Thaw each vial in 20–25 mL of the DNase I supplemented 1× HBSS+/+ media and incubate at 37°C for 10–15 min before centrifuging at 700 g for 10 min at R.T. (acceleration/deceleration: 9/9). Discard supernatant and resuspend the pellet in DNase I supplemented 1× HBSS+/+. Further incubate for 10 min at 37°C prior to counting and analysis. Otherwise, proceed with the fresh samples from step 25.\nPre-cool centrifuge to 4°C.",
    "Prior to starting staining, prepare LIVE/DEADTM Fixable Dead Cell Stain solution in 1× PBS at a suitable concentration – we recommend a dilution factor of 1 in 1,000.\nNow prepare a master mix of fluorochrome-labeled antibodies against markers of interest using an appropriate panel of labeled-antibodies (refer to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for an example panel - the antibody dilutions in this table are titrated for staining in a volume of 50 μL). The total volume of master mix required will depend on number of samples being stained.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1615_7.csv\nCritical: Antibody master mixes should be prepared in a 50:50 mix of 1× PBS and BD Brilliant Stain Buffer and protected from light. The use of BD Brilliant Stain Buffer is essential to prevent the generation of artifacts from interactions between dyes. The Brilliant Stain Buffer is not needed when only one brilliant dye is being used in the antibody master mix.\nNote: The LIVE/DEADTM Fixable Dead Cell Stain can be directly added to the antibody master mix to combine staining steps and reduce time needed for staining. However, we observed better separation of live and dead cells when stains are done separately, so ensure the optimization of the LIVE/DEADTM Stain concentration is carried out for detection of dead cells.\nTransfer IHL in a maximum volume of 200 μL per well to a 96 well U-bottom tissue culture treated plate.\nNote: We recommend staining a maximum of 2 × 106 cells per well of a 96 well U-bottom plate.\nCentrifuge the plate at 500 g at 4°C for 4 min and gently discard the supernatant, careful not to disturb the cell pellet.\nResuspend cells in 50 μL of LIVE/DEADTM Stain solution per well. Incubate for either 15 min at R.T. or 30 min at 4°C protected from light.",
    "Supplement each well with 150 μL 1× PBS and centrifuge at 500 g at 4°C for 4 min.\nOptional: Prior to staining cells with surface antibodies, you may wish to protect samples from non-specific antibody binding using 25 μL/well of FcR Block, prepared as per manufacturer’s instructions. This is particularly important if you require optimal staining of B cells, as represented in this example antibody panel. Following a 10 min incubation at 4°C, you may proceed directly to step 33.\nGently discard the supernatant and resuspend cells in 50 μL of your antibody master mix prepared in step 27. Leave cells to incubate for 30 min at 4°C protected from light.\nSupplement each well with 150 μL 1× PBS and centrifuge at 500 g at 4°C for 4 min.\nGently discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 100 μL BD CytofixTM buffer per well. Pipette up and down several times to avoid cell clumping. Incubate for 20 min at 4°C protected from light.\nNote: Alternative commercially available fixation solutions can be used, e.g., 1%–4% formaldehyde.\nSupplement each well with 100 μL 1× PBS and centrifuge at 500 g at 4°C for 4 min.\nGently discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL 1× PBS ready for acquisition by flow cytometry, transferring fully stained IHL into FACS tubes.\nPause point: Stained samples may be run the following day when kept at 4°C and protected from light. To avoid the degradation of the fluorochromes, we recommend the analysis be carried out as soon as possible.",
    "Note: We recommend placing a 1.2 mL ‘small insert’ tube (e.g., Corning 96-well Cluster Tubes, Cat# 4401) with the stained cells inside a FACS tube to reduce the residual volume, which is important when working with limiting cell numbers. If the flow cytometer model allows, samples may also be analyzed using a HTS sample coupler for acquisition of samples from a 96-well plate.\nAcquire data using an appropriate flow cytometer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section on 5-laser BD LSRFortessa X20 flow cytometer for configuration) running BD FACSDiva v. 9.0.1.\nAnalyze data using appropriate software, such as FlowJo v. 10.\nNote: For more complex staining, including detection of intracellular or intranuclear molecules, refer to our staining protocol (Cossarizza et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). For assessment of cellular functionality and the detection of intracellular molecules such as cytokines and chemokines, an appropriate stimulus, and the use of protein transport inhibitors (Monensin and/or Brefeldin A) will often be required."
