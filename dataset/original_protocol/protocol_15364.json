    "1. Isolation of rat mesenteric small artery\nAnesthetize animal with isoflurane in a closed chamber and wipe the abdomen with alcohol.\nPerform a mid-line laparotomy to expose mesenteric bed.\nUsing scissors, remove about 85 cm of intestine with feeding vasculature with the superior mesenteric artery. Cut the proximal end of intestinal section close to the pylorus and the distal end near the ileo-coecal junction. Segments of the intestine are isolated from rats that are deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and euthanized by open-chest cardiac puncture.\nPlaced excised section in a coated petri dish containing PSS and perform the dissection of the mesenteric artery at room temperature.\nPin down the proximal end of the intestine on the right hand side and pin out the remainder of the intestineina counter-clockwise direction (i.e.proximal end on the left feeding vasculature on the far side of the intestine).\nDissect out the branch II and III segments together with a piece of the proximal segment.\nDissect out the vein and isolate the artery (with V-shaped branch point) and clean it by removing the adipose and connective tissue. Avoid direct contact with the artery by pulling gently with forceps and cutting through the membrane of the connective tissue.\n2. Mounting of vessel\nCut two short segments (≈ 4 cm) of a 40 μm tungsten-free stainless steel wire and, with a fine forceps,insert one into the lumen of each artery taking care not to damage the endothelium. Use the wire tip to open the lumen if necessary. Blood streaming out of the vessel is a good sign the lumen is opened.",
    "Fill the myograph chamber with physiological salt solution (PSS; mM: 115 NaCl, 4.7 KCl, 1.4 MgSO4.7H2O, 5 NaHCO3, 1.2 K2HPO4, 1.1 Na2HPO4, 1.0 CaCl2, 20 HEPES and 5 glucose, pH 7.4) with ascorbic acid (100 μM) at 37 °C and using forceps carefully transfer the threaded vessel segment from the petri dish into the chamber at room temperature and transfer the excised proximal vessel segment to the myograph chamber and pull the end along the wire to feed it into the vessel. Avoid stretching the vessel.\nSecure the near end of the wire counter-clockwise under the near fixing screw on the right-hand jaw connected to the micrometer. Catch the free end of the wire with forceps and secure it clockwise under the far fixing screw on the right-hand jaw. Ensure that the vessel segment along the wire is situated in the gap between the jaws without making any contact with the jaw itself.\nScrew the jaws apart, and align the second wire parallel with the vessel and insert it into the far end of the lumen. Gently feed the wire through the lumen of the vessel segment in one motion using the already mounted wire as a guide. Hold the wire about 1 cm from the vessel to avoid stretching it during the maneuver, and avoid touching the endothelium.\nScrew the jaws together and ensure that the second mounting wire moves underneath the first one secured on the right-hand jaw.\nSecure the near end of the second wire in a clockwise direction under the near fixing screw of the left-hand jaw connected to the transducer.\nSecure the far end of the wire under the fixing screw on the left-hand jaw and tighten to stretch the wire.",
    "Once mounting is complete, reset the motor in the \"Mounting Menu\" and start normalization of the vessel.\n3. Normalization\nThe Auto Dual Wire Myograph System- 510A has an automated normalization function, which is assessed from the \"Normalization\" menu and allows the vessel to be stretched to a normalized internal circumference by a standardized procedure according to the manufacturer's protocol after equilibration for 30 min at 37 °C. An exponential curve is then fitted to the internal circumference pressure data. The procedure defines the lumen diameter (d100) that the artery would have had in vivo when relaxed and under a transmural pressure of 100 mmHg1.The normalization parameters for rat mesenteric artery are as follows:\nTarget transmural pressure = 13.3 kPa (100 mm Hg).\nTime = 60 sec; Duration of each of the normalization steps.\nIC1/IC100 = 0.9 (IC1 = normalized internal circumference, IC100 = internal circumference corresponding to target pressure.\nEyepiece calibration 2*Δ (mm/ocular division); 2 delta is for programming reasons.\nMeasure the length of the mounted mesenteric artery using the microscope eye-piece readings when the hairlines are over the far and near ends of the mounted vessel segment. Briefly, the length of the mounted vessel segment is measured at maximum magnification with a calibrated ocular eye-piece in the dissection microscope. The eye-piece reading with hair-line over the far end of the segment (a1) and the near end of the segment (a2) in ocular divisions are measured and recorded. These values, with the micrometer readings, before and after stretching the vessel are recorded and entered into the menus for the program to calculate the fitted curve and the internal diameter corresponding to the a target transmural pressure of 100 mm Hg",
    "In our studies, the arteries were set to the lumen diameter of d1 = 0.9 x d100, where active force development is maximal. Active force development of ≥ 10 mN in rat mesenteric arteries is considered optimum for experiments to proceed. Tissues with lower active force were discarded.\n4. Measurement of responses\nAfter normalization, the mechanical and functional properties of vessels are re-activated by performing a \"standard start\", which involves challenging vessels with repeated applications (normally 2 or 3) of 5 μM phenylephrine (PE) to obtain reproducible contractions. A typical \"standard start\" in our laboratory consists of a series of stimulations and washout periods as follows:\nReplace myograph chamber cover and start aeration with 95% air and 5% CO2.\nFill chamber with fresh PSS (containing 100 μM ascorbic acid)\nContract vessel with 5 μM PE for 5 min and wash 4 times with PSS buffer.\nAfter the last wash, refill chamber with PSS and wait 3 min before repeating steps (ii) and (iii).\nAfter the standard start, the artery is ready for the experiment. Relaxations of contracted vessels are assessed by cumulative addition of increasing concentrations of CaCl2 (0.5 - 4 mM). When inhibitors are used vessels are pre-incubated with the compounds in the myograph chamber for 20 min and present during the assays.\n5. Data analysis",
    "The \"Normalization\" data for vessels and force tracings, directly converted to text data,were analyzed with the SigmaPlot 11.0 graphing program (Systat Software, Point Richmond, CA) and plotted as shown in Figure 1. Concentration-response data, calculated from the tracings, were analyzed by determining EC50 values from experimental data fitted to a four-parameter logistic function in the Pharmacology menu of the program. Comparisons between groups and within groups were carried out by One Way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and differences with p < 0.05 are considered significant.\n6.
