    "Transplantation of T cell-depleted bone marrow (optional; if using immunodeficient Rag-KO hosts proceed to step B)Host mice are typically aged between 8-12 weeks of age at the time of irradiation, and are of mixed sex. Mice aged between 6-8 weeks may also be suitable hosts, although we recommend providing young mice with softened food and avoiding the use of young females with low body weight (<20 g). We use an F1 cross between C57BL/6 and B10.BR mice as host mice for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation experiments, with B10.BR bone marrow/Treg donors. Use of F1 hosts is recommended due to superior Treg reconstitution in this system. We have successfully performed syngeneic Treg reconstitution on non-F1 host mice (e.g., B10.BR), but have observed inferior reconstitution using allogeneic Tregs (C57BL/6), possibly due to rejection by radio-resistant NK cells (Davis et al., 2015). Inject host mice with 100 μl vitamin K (10 mg/ml solution) via subcutaneous injection in either scruff or flank 1 day prior to irradiation using an insulin syringe. We routinely give lethally irradiated mice this prophylactic treatment to prevent post-irradiation coagulopathy that has occasionally been observed in our mouse colony. Additional injections are given 3 and 7 days after irradiation.Ear mark and weigh all host mice prior to irradiation.Transfer host mice into Perspex irradiation chambers and place into an appropriate container, then transfer to irradiator.Irradiate host mice at 600Rad, then transfer back into cages.After resting mice for 3 h, perform a further irradiation of 600Rad (repeating steps A4-5).1 day after irradiation, harvest femurs and tibias from 6-20 week old allogeneic donor mice and collect into 20 ml RPMI + 10% FBS in a 50 ml conical tube. We recommend using 1 donor mouse for every 5-8 recipients.",
    "Trim the ends off each bone and flush out bone marrow with RPMI + 10% FBS using a 1 ml syringe with a 25 gauge needle.Resuspend bone marrow cells and filter through 70 μm nylon mesh into a 50 ml conical tube.Centrifuge cells at 125 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, and resuspend in 1 ml MACS wash and add anti-Thy1.2 hybridoma supernatant at a concentration of 1 x 106 cells/1 μl supernatant. Incubate on ice for 30 min. Alternatively anti-CD3 hybridoma supernatant can be used instead of anti-Thy1.2 to bind T cells.Spin down cells at 125 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Discard supernatant and resuspend pellet in 20 ml MACS wash, then spin down cells at 125 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.

The unbound fraction contains T cell-depleted BM cells.Centrifuge T cell-depleted BM cells at 125 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Resuspend pellet at 16.7 x 106 cells/ml in RPMI for injection. Store cells on ice until ready for use. Note: This concentration is suitable for transfer of 5 x 106 cells in a volume of 300 μl.",
    "The volume used for intravenous injections may vary depending on the policies of individual institutions. If so, the concentration of cells may be adjusted to allow transfer of 5 x 106 cells in an alternative volume.Warm host mice (irradiated the previous day) for approximately 10 min under a heat lamp to cause peripheral vasodilation, or for as long as needed to dilate the tail vein. Transfer mice to Perspex mouse restrainer. Using a 1 ml insulin syringe inject 300 μl of T cell-depleted bone marrow cells (or alternative volume containing 5 x 106 cells) into the tail vein of host mice. For a more detailed explanation of intravenous injections refer to Machholz et al. (2012).The drinking water of all irradiated mice is supplemented with sulfamethoxazole (80 μg/ml) and trimethoprim (160 μg/ml) for three weeks post-irradiation.Selective reconstitution of the Treg compartment of bone marrow transplant recipients or immunodeficient Rag-KO miceWild type mice on an immunosufficient background aged between 6-20 weeks are used as donors for transfer into either allogeneic irradiated hosts (described in part A), or syngeneic immunodeficient Rag-KO hosts aged between 8-16 weeks. For transfer into Treg-reconstituted allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients (part A) allogeneic B10.BR donors of 6-20 weeks of age are used. For transfer into Rag-KO mice several strain combinations have been tested with comparable results, including C57BL/6 donors into C57BL/6 Rag-KO hosts, B10.BR donors into B10.BR Rag-KO hosts, and [C57BL/6 x B10.BR]F1 donors into [C57BL/6 x B10.BR]F1 Rag-KO hosts. Treg reconstitution has been tested in both male and female host mice with success, but use of female host mice is avoided when Tregs are derived from male donors. A ratio of 1 donor mouse for every recipient is recommended.Remove lymph nodes and spleens from donor mice.",

For transfer of 2.5 x 106 cells, 1 donor is sufficient to reconstitute 8-10 recipient mice. For transfer into Treg-reconstituted allogeneic bone marrow transplant recipients (parts A and B) allogeneic B10.BR donors of 6-20 weeks of age are used.
