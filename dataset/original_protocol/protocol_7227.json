    "The immunomagnetic acquisition of HAMVECs described here is a two-staged procedure encompassing their isolation from fat and the subsequent enrichment of their cultures (Figure 1). It comprises four main steps: (A) harvesting the stromal vascular fraction from adipose tissue; (B) isolating HAMVECs from the stromal vascular fraction; (C) culturing the HAMVECs; and (D) enriching cultures of HAMVECs. The use of immunomagnetic microparticles delineated herein is key to the efficacy of the procedure (see Notes). This procedure was developed to enable the acquisition of HAMVECs from whole subcutaneous abdominal white adipose tissue but may be readily applied to lipoaspirate.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4422/bioprotoc-12-10-4422-g001.jpgFigure 1. Immunomagnetic acquisition of endothelial cells from human adipose tissue. Schematic depicts the main steps involved in the isolation and enrichment of HAMVECs, as well as the rationale underlying the specific use of the immunomagnetic microparticles. Adapted from Antonyshyn et al. (2021).Harvest the stromal vascular fraction from adipose tissue (Duration: 2–3 h)Prepare the collagenase solution (see Recipes) and allow it to warm to 37°C using a water bath before processing the tissuea,b. The trypsin-EDTA solution and Endothelial Cell Growth Medium-2 may also be placed in the water bath to pre-warm to 37°C at this time. The MACS buffer (see Recipes) should be stored at 4°C in the fridge; PBS–/– and the erythrocyte lysis buffer (see Recipes) can be used as stored at room temperature (~21°C).It is recommended that the collagenase solutions be prepared in multiples of two to help balance the centrifuge and that HAMVECs be isolated from the stromal vascular fraction derived from at least four collagenase solutions – corresponding to ~60 cm3 of fat – to mitigate the need for their protracted culture-mediated expansion (Table 1).",
    "The volume of adipose tissue available for processing may be estimated based on its mass – measured using a balance – where the approximate density of fat is 0.9 g/cm3 (Abe et al., 2021). This estimate can be used to help determine the number of collagenase solutions that should be prepared (Table 1).Table 1. Guide for the isolation of endothelial cells from human adipose tissue. Initial yield of HAMVECs obtained from a given amount of adipose tissue, prior to their enrichment and subsequent culture-mediated expansion, as well as the corresponding number of collagenase solutions that would need to be prepared. Isolating HAMVECs from 60–120 cm3 of fat is the most cost-efficient.table:",

    "Excise adipose tissue from any skin using operating scissors and tissue forceps (Figure 2). Rinse the tissue with PBS–/– before mincing it with operating scissors in a Petri dish. Using a scoopula, add 15 cm3 of minced tissue to the pre-warmed collagenase solutiona. Incubate the solution for 60 min at 37°C under constant, gentle agitation using an incubated shaker plate.The volume of adipose tissue being added is determined based on its displacement of the collagenase solution. Specifically, add minced tissue to the 25 mL of collagenase solution to achieve a total volume of 40 mL in each of the 50 mL conical tubes – invert the conical tubes to mix the minced tissue with the collagenase solution before assessing the volume, using the graduations demarked on the conical tubes.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4422/bioprotoc-12-10-4422-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Discard the buoyant adipocytes and oil using a 25 mL serological pipette; the supernatant can be aspirated as preferred – taking care not to disrupt the loosely pelleted cells and tissue constituting the stromal vascular fraction (Figure 2). Rinse the pellet by resuspending it in 20 mL PBS–/–, centrifuging it at 1,200 × g and 21°C for 5 min, and discarding the supernatant.Resuspend the pellet in 20 mL of pre-warmed trypsin-EDTA solution and incubate for 15 min at 37°C under constant, gentle agitation.Add 20 mL of pre-warmed Endothelial Cell Growth Medium-2 to the solution, centrifuge it at 1,200 × g and 21°C for 5 min, and discard the supernatant.",

Comprising the stromal vascular fraction, the filtrate is immediately prepared for magnet-assisted cell sorting.Isolate CD45–CD31+ HAMVECs from the stromal vascular fraction by magnet-assisted cell sorting (Figure 3)a,b (Duration: 1.5–3 h)The stromal vascular fraction is depleted of CD45+ leukocytes prior to positively selecting for CD45–CD31+ HAMVECs due to the high prevalence of leukocytes in adipose tissue and their capacity to express characteristic endothelial markers, including CD31.CD45–CD31– ASCs are a by-product of this procedure and may be retained for downstream studies (see Notes).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4422/bioprotoc-12-10-4422-g003.jpgFigure 3.

    "Plate the CD45–CD31+ HAMVECs onto tissue culture-treated polystyrene at a density of ~25,000 cells/cm2 in pre-warmed Endothelial Cell Growth Medium-2, and maintain in culture at 37°C, 5% CO2 under a relative humidity of 85%a,b.Table 1 delineates the recommended primary culture vessels onto which HAMVECs can be plated based on the amount of adipose tissue from which they were derived.CD45–CD31– ASCs may also be plated onto tissue culture-treated polystyrene at a density of 25,000 cells/cm2, and cultured under the same conditions in the media of your choice.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20220517/20220517170742_8685.jpg Figure 4.

Representative photomicrographs depicting (A) the characteristic endothelial cobblestone-like morphology of HAMVECs and the spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like morphology of ASCs, as well as (B–D) different extents of contamination of primary cultures by ASCs. Scale bars represent 200 µm. Adapted from Antonyshyn et al. (2021).Exchange Endothelial Cell Growth Medium-2 every other day, monitoring primary cultures for confluence and signs of stromal cell contamination (Figure 4)a. Once the cultures are ~90% confluent, the cells are ready to be passaged into larger culture vessels – unless their overgrowth by ASCs is considerableb.HAMVECs assume a characteristic endothelial cobblestone-like morphology after ~4 days, while residual ASCs from the magnet-assisted cell sorting procedure exhibit a spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like morphology (Figure 4A).The presence of a small number of contaminating ASCs in between colonies of HAMVECs is typical at this stage and should not be of concern (Figure 4B, C). However, if ASCs are out-proliferating and overtaking HAMVECs (Figure 4D), proceed directly to their enrichment (Step D) rather than passaging (Steps C3–C4).Aspirate the media, rinse cells with PBS–/–, and harvest the cells by incubating them in TrypLE Express for 10 min at 37°C a.",

Using a serological pipette to repeatedly dispense media over the culture surface also helps recover the cells.Table 1 provides the recommended culture vessels onto which HAMVECs can be re-plated based on their primary culture vessel.Maintain HAMVECs in culture until they attain ~90% confluence, after which their cultures can be enriched to eliminate any residual ASCs.Enrich primary cultures of CD45–CD31+ HAMVECs by magnet-assisted cell sorting (Duration: 1.5–2 h)Aspirate the media, rinse cells with PBS–/–, and harvest the cells by incubating them in TrypLE Express for 10 min at 37°C.

The HAMVECs can now be expanded or used for downstream investigationsa.",
    "While one round of enrichment is typically sufficient in obtaining CD45–CD31+ HAMVECs with a purity ≥98%, their cultures should be monitored for signs of stromal cell contamination and overgrowth. In the event of the latter, another round of enrichment may be performed (Step D)."
