    "Note: Steps 1 to 7 performed in a tissue culture hood; steps 8 to 10 done on regular bench.    The day before transfection: Seed log-phase growing cells of interest (2 x 105 cells in 2 ml) in a 35-mm glass bottom culture dish and allow overnight incubation for proper cell attachment and expansion in a 37 °C cell culture incubator. Note: Optimum cell cultures are 30% to 40% confluent with a low percentage of overlapping cells on the day of transfection.  Note: Pre-warm culture medium and 1x PBS to 37 °C.   Rinse cells twice with 2 ml of 37 °C 1x PBS. Note: Avoid center glass area when pipetting solutions at all steps.   Replace with 1 ml antibiotic-free medium.   Co-transfect Venus-N-p53 and Venus-C-PDID constructs with Lipofectamine 2000 according to manufacture's instructions. Note: 0.5 μg of each construct (total 1 μg DNA) plus 2.5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 in 25 μl of Opti-MEM works well with HCT116 cells.  Note: Negative controls, such as Venus-N-p53 with Venus-C linked to a non-interacting protein (or domain, e.g., Brd4 amino acids 149-284 described in Wu et al., 2013), Venus-N-p53 with Venus-C, Venus-N with Venus-C-PDID, or Venus-N with Venus-C, should be included in parallel for comparison.   Leave cells at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator.   Replace transfection medium with complete medium 6 hours post-transfection.   Incubate cells for 24 h at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator. Note: Incubation time after transfection can vary by the level of protein expression. Pilot experiments to test the optimum expression time and the levels of protein expression for Venus-N-p53 and Venus-C-PDID are beneficial (see Figure 2).   Note: The amounts of transiently expressed proteins should be titrated to the levels of the endogenous proteins, reflecting endogenous protein interaction in vivo.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131020/20131020230249_2429.jpg Figure 2.

    "Western blot analysis of Venus protein expression in p53-null (p53-/-) HCT116 cells, 24 hours post-transfection. Antibodies: Venus-N-p53, Venus-C-PDID, and β-Actin.    Wash cells for 5 min with 2 ml of 1x PBS on a rocker at a speed of 10-20 rpm, total three times.  Note: This step is important to reduce the background signals of Hoechst 33258 due to non-specific adherence of transfection DNA deposits to the plate surfaces.   Prepare for cell imaging:  For live-cell imaging: Note: Perform steps a to c (see below) on a rocker at the speed of 10-20 rpm.  Note: Avoid center glass area when pipetting solutions at all steps.   Stain DNA in the nucleus with Hoechst 33258, 2 ml (5 μg/ml), for 30 min at room temperature. Note: For multiple dishes, prepare one dish at a time before next Hoechst 33258 staining so there is enough time for fluorescence microscope visualization.   Remove staining solution and wash cells for 5 min with 2 ml of 1x PBS, total three times.   Add 1 ml of 1x PBS for fluorescence detection.   Visualize fluorescence signals under a fluorescence microscope.   Acquire lower magnification images and then higher magnification images of bright field, Venus, and Hoechst 33258. Note: This step may take up to 30 to 60 min depending on adjusting position/focus and higher resolution of images desired.   Typical results are shown in Figure 3.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131020/20131020230348_4918.jpg Figure 3. BiFC results. Direct visualization of p53-PDID interaction in vivo by BiFC live-cell imaging performed with p53-null (p53-/-) HCT116 cells transiently expressing Venus-N-p53 and Venus-C-PDID. A. Two different magnification images were obtained by using the 10x ocular lens in combination with a 20x or 60x objective lens.",
    "A 20x objective lens is typically used for observing a large number of cells and providing a general glimpse of cellular localization, whereas a 60x objective lens allows more detailed localization within subcellular compartments (Kerppola, 2006). Merge: combined Venus (pseudo-colored green), Hoechst 33258 (pseudo-colored blue), and bright field signals. B. Magnified images of p53-PDID interaction shown in A (i and ii) from 600x images. The BiFC signals co-localize with nuclear DNA staining (Hoechst 33258) as presented in pseudo-colored cyan. Images were obtained by Nikon Eclipse TE-2000E/C1 confocal fluorescence microscopy using NIS Element Basic Research software and further processed by Nikon EZ-C1 software.  Note: Fixed cell images are virtually the same as live-cell imaging (data not shown).    For fixed-cell imaging: Note: Perform steps a to k (see below) on a rocker at a speed of 10-20 rpm.  Note: Avoid center glass area when pipetting solutions at all steps.   Fix cell with 1 ml 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Note: 3.7% formaldehyde must be freshly prepared.   Remove formaldehyde solution and wash fixed cells 5 min with 2 ml of 1x PBS, total three times.   Remove wash solution and incubate fixed cells with 2 ml of 1x PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 to permeabilize cells for 30 min at room temperature.   Wash cells for 5 min with 2 ml of 1x PBS, total three times. Note: Skip antibody incubation procedures (steps e to i) if only signals from Venus and Hoechst 33258 (i.e., without fluorophore-conjugated antibody amplification) are needed.  However these steps are helpful for verifying protein expression in transfected cells.   Incubate permeabilized cells with 2 ml of PBSTB for 30 min to block non-specific antibody binding.",
    "Replace PBSTB with primary antibody (against protein of interest or GFP) in 1 ml of PBSTB for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Note: Start with 1:500 antibody dilution to determine the best condition. Two primary antibodies can be used at the same time.   Wash cells for 5 min with 2 ml of 1x PBS, total three times.   Incubate with secondary antibody (conjugated with fluorophores) in 1 ml of PBSTB for 1 hour at room temperature in the dark (wrap with aluminum foil). Note: Start with 1:1,000 antibody dilution to determine best condition.   Wash cells for 5 min with 2 ml of 1x PBS, total three times.   Stain cell nucleus DNA with Hoechst 33258, 2 ml (0.5 μg/ml), for 10 min.   Wash cells for 5 min with 2 ml of 1x PBS, total three times.   Add 1 ml of 1x PBS for fluorescence detection.   Visualize reconstituted fluorescence signal under a fluorescence microscope.   Acquire lower magnification images and then higher magnification images of bright field, Venus, Hoechst 33258, or other signals from fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody.     When needed, permanent preservation of samples can be done by the following steps:   Remove PBS and use razor blade to separate the bottom glass (i.e., coverslip) from the petri dish (see Figure 4A). Note: Do not touch the cell-attached side in the center circle of coverslip.   Drop 50 μl of mounting medium on a microscope slide (see Figure 4B).   Gently tilt the coverslip (see Figure 4C), with the cell-attached side facing down, to mount with mounting medium on a microscope slide (see Figure 4D).   Gently press coverslip in the center with a pipet tip to remove air bubbles (see Figure 4E) and remove excess mounting medium around the edges with a paper towel (see Figure 4F).",
    "Mark microscope slides and seal coverslip with nail polish around the edges for 15 min, or until dry, to prevent sample movement and drying (see Figure 4G).   Store at -20 °C or 4 °C in the dark.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131020/20131020230649_6705.jpg Figure 4.  Illustration of permanent preservation of BiFC samples"
