    "Heparinized human blood is obtained for neutrophil isolation from healthy adult donors (males and females, aged between 21 and 60 years old), following informed consent as approved by the Institutional Review Board of Temple University (Philadelphia, PA, USA).\n1. Priming and coating the device with human fibronectin\nNOTE: The bMFA has two inlet ports and two outlet ports connected to the vascular compartment. It also has one port connected to the tissue compartment (Figure 2).\nInsert tubing (O.D. of 0.06\" and I.D. of 0.02\") (Table of Materials) to all the ports except for one inlet port with fine-point forceps. Clamp the two outlet ports and the tissue compartment port with jaw clamps. Ensure that each tubing is ~1 inch in length.\nDilute human fibronectin to 100 µg/mL with PBS from fibronectin stock solution (1mg/mL). Load a 1 mL syringe with prepared fibronectin solution. Connect the syringe to a 24 G blunt needle and a ~4-inch long tubing.\n\tNOTE: To prevent crosslinking, do not over mix/pipette human fibronectin. Other extracellular matrices (ECM) such as collagen may be used for different cell types.\nInsert the tubing into the open inlet port, push the plunger until human fibronectin comes out of the other inlet port, then clamp it. Repeat this process for the rest of the ports until all the channels, tissue compartment and tubing are filled with the human fibronectin solution. Remove the needle but keep the 4-inch long tubing inserted and unclamped.\n\tNOTE: Make sure the tubing is filled with fibronectin before it is clamped.\nFor degassing, connect the unclamped tubing to a compressed nitrogen tank through the Pneumatic Primer, adjust the pressure to ~5 psi and run for ~15 min.",
    "After 15 min, check under the microscope to make sure there are no air bubbles trapped in the device. If there are air bubbles trapped in the channel or tissue compartment, reconnect the device to the Pneumatic Primer for degassing again, i.e., repeat step 1.4.\n\tNOTE: Inverted microscope is used in all the steps involving microscopy in this protocol.\nRemove the device from the Pneumatic Primer. Incubate the device at 37 °C for 1 h, then flush all the channels and tissue compartment with pre-warmed HLMVEC culture media (Table of Materials), similar to step 1.3. The bMFA is now ready for cell seeding.\n\t​NOTE: Before removing/inserting a tubing from port, first place a drop of water with a pipette around the base of the inlet port tubing to prevent air from entering the device.\n2. Seeding bMFA with HLMVEC\nCulture HLMVEC to 60%- 80% confluency according to the vendor's protocol in a T-25 flask.\nAspirate HLMVEC culture media from cell culture flask. Wash twice with PBS.\nAdd 2 mL of pre-warmed trypsin-EDTA solution (37 °C) in the T-25 flask. Incubate for 3-5 min in an incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) until most cells are detached from the flask.\n\tNOTE: Incubation time may vary for different cell types and trypsin-EDTA concentration.\nAdd 2 mL of Trypsin Neutralization Solution (TNS, 37 °C) to the flask to neutralize trypsin-EDTA.\nGently tap the flask to help dissociate the cells. Then, transfer the cell suspension solution to a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 150 x g to pellet the endothelial cells. Remove the supernatant and resuspend cells in 3 mL of cell culture media. Count the number of cells with a hemocytometer.",
    "Centrifuge again for 5 min at 150 x g to pellet the cells. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells to the desired seeding density of 20 x 106/mL.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the cell types and confluency, about 2 x 106 endothelial cells can be collected from two T-25 flasks, and with the seeding density of 20 x 106/mL, 100 µL of the cell suspension (2 x 106 endothelial cells), is sufficient to seed 5 devices.\nMount a 1 mL syringe in the programmable syringe pump, attach tubing to the blunt needle.\nDraw ~20 µL of the cell suspension into the tubing, making sure the cell suspension is only in the tubing, not in the syringe barrel.\nTake the clamp off an outlet port of the device. Connect the tubing to one inlet of the device. Make sure no air bubbles are introduced into the channel.\nStart the pump with a flow rate of 4-8 µL/min. Observe the device under a microscope.\nWhen the channels are filled with cells, stop the pump, clamp the outlet, and cut the inlet tubing.\n\tNOTE: Take care not to introduce air bubbles into the device.\nPut the device in the incubator for 4 h at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.\nAfter 4 h incubation, prepare another syringe filled with fresh cell culture media. Mount the syringe on a syringe pump, connect the syringe to the inlet port and remove the clamp from an outlet port.\nRun fresh media through the device for about 5 min at 4-8 µL/min to wash out floating/unattached cells.\n3. Cell culture under flow for 48 h",
    "Prepare a syringe filled with fresh cell culture media. Mount the syringe in a syringe pump, connect the syringe to one inlet port and keep an outlet open. Put the device in the incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C).\nProgram the syringe pump for culturing endothelial cells under flow using the following instructions mentioned in Table 1.\nCheck bMFA under a microscope after 48 h of culture under flow. HLMVEC should cover vascular channels forming a complete lumen (Figure 6).\n\tNOTE: Other flow regimes may be required for different cell types.\n4. Cytokine and/or therapeutic treatment\nNOTE: As an example, this section describes using bMFA to study the impact of treating the cells with Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) and a novel anti-inflammatory inhibitor (Protein Kinase C delta-TAT peptide inhibitor, PKCδ-i)18,27,32,33,34,35,36.\nPrepare three different bMFA devices using the protocol above (section 1-3).\nLoad three 1 mL syringe with cell culture media, (TNF-α) (10 ng/mL), TNF-α (10 ng/mL) + PKCδ-i (5 µM), respectively.\n\tNOTE: Cytokines are reconstituted in cell culture media.\nConnect the three syringes to three bMFA devices. Treat HLMVEC with buffer TNF-α or TNF-α + inhibitor for 4 h at 0.1 µL/min.\n\t​NOTE: Based on specific study requirements, other cytokines or cytokine cocktails (e.g., TNF-α + Interleukin 1 beta (IL1-β) + Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ)), may be used to treat endothelial cells.\n5. Human neutrophil isolation\nUse all reagents at room temperature (RT). Reagents include leukocyte isolation media , 1x HEPES buffer with Ca2+/Mg2+ (Table 2), 6% Dextran in normal saline (0.9% NaCl), 3.6% NaCl solution and de-ionized water (DI) water.\nPipette 20 mL of leukocyte isolation media into a 50 mL conical tube and carefully layer 25 mL of blood over the leukocyte isolation media. Centrifuge for 40 min at 427 x g at RT.",
    "NOTE: Perform this step slowly and carefully to avoid mixing the blood and leukocyte isolation media.\nAspirate down to ~5 mL above red blood cells (RBC) layer. The white buffy layer on top of the RBC is predominantly neutrophils.\nAdd HEPES buffer to double the current volume (existing volume: HEPES buffer = 1:1).\nAdd an amount of 6% Dextran, which will be 20% of the final volume. (current volume/4 = volume of added 6% Dextran).\nInvert the tube gently a few times to mix well and let the RBC sediment (~25 min).\nCarefully pipette the upper layer (neutrophil-rich layer) and transfer to a new 50 mL tube, be careful not to contaminate with sedimented RBC.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 315 x g at RT. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 8 mL of HEPES buffer.\nTo lyse the residual RBC, add 24 mL of DI water and gently mix for 50 s. Immediately, add 8 mL of 3.6% NaCl solution, mix and centrifuge for 10 min at 315 x g at RT.\nRemove the supernatant, wash the cell pellet with 15 mL of HEPES buffer and centrifuge for 5 min at 315 x g. Resuspend the pellet in HEPES buffer.\n6. Neutrophil adhesion and migration experiment with bMFA\nResuspend the isolated human neutrophils (15 million) in 999 µL of HEPES buffer.\nAdd 1 µL CFDA-SE (carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester) dye stock solution (10 mM) to neutrophil suspension to obtain a working concentration of 10 µM CFDA-SE and incubate for 10 min at RT. Wash the cells twice with HEPES buffer by centrifuging for 5 min at 315 x g.",
    "Count the neutrophils using a hemocytometer and resuspend at 2 million neutrophils/mL with cell culture media, TNF-α (10 ng/mL) and TNF-α (10 ng/mL) +PKCδ-i (5 μM), respectively; incubate for 15 min at RT before the start of the experiment.\nPrepare a syringe filled with 1 µM N-formyl-met-leu-phe (fMLP), the chemoattractant for the study, in cell culture media. Take bMFA and open one inlet port and one outlet port.\n\tNOTE: These experimental conditions are used to mimic the conditions of sepsis that include a systemic inflammatory response with high levels of circulating cytokine/chemokines. Furthermore, fMLP, a Gram-negative bacteria-derived peptide, is used to model the presence of bacteria in the lung (i.e., tissue compartment).\nRemove the tissue compartment port tubing and insert the fMLP tubing. Inject ~20 µL of fMLP into the tissue compartment for all bMFA, except the one treated with cell culture media alone. Then cut the tubing and clamp it.\nFill the syringe with ~200 µL of the neutrophil suspension and mount the syringe on the syringe pump.\nPut the device on the inverted microscope stage (Table of Materials).\nStart the pump at a flow rate is 1 µL/min and wait until a small drop of the neutrophil suspension comes out of the tubing. Insert the tubing into the inlet port. See Figure 7 for the setup.\n7. Acquire images\nUse the Scan Large Image function in the microscope image analysis software (Table of Materials) to obtain the adhesion map in bMFA (Figure 8) 10 min after starting the experiment. Most of the neutrophils enter bMFA during the first 10 min.\n\tNOTE: Keep the fluorescence light off when not taking images to reduce photobleaching.",
    "During the next hour, take timelapse images (1 image every 5 min) of the tissue compartment (Figure 8B,C) for migration analysis to obtain the migration map.\n8. Digital Image analysis\nFor the adhesion map, count the number of adhered neutrophils in each vessel. For each bifurcation, create a circular region of interest (ROI) with a diameter equal to two times the vessel diameter and count the number of adhered neutrophils.\nUse manual count or the automated Object Count function to quantify the number of adhering neutrophils in each vessel and bifurcation region.\nUse the shear rate map of the network generated using CFD simulation17 to determine the shear rate in each vessel. Then plot the number of adhered neutrophils in a given vessel against the shear rate in that vessel to create a shear rate map in bMFA as shown in Figure 9A.\nNeutrophils are counted as migrated if they have crossed through the endothelium into the tissue compartment. Count the number of migrated neutrophils at 10 min, 15 min, 30 min and 60 min. Plot the number of migrated neutrophils versus time as shown in Figure 9B.\nSubscription Required.
