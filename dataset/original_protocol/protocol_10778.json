    "Note: Perform all steps preparatory steps under sterile conditions.\n1. Preparation of Plastic Cones for Seed Germination\n Fill a 10 cm Petri dish with growth medium containing 1% agar to a thickness of 5 mm. We use a half strength modified Hoagland medium4, but medium composition should be chosen to suit individual experimental requirements.   \n While the medium is still liquid, use a multi-channel pipette to fill 10 μl pipette tips with 5 μl of medium from the Petri dish. \n Store the filled tips in the pipette tip box until the medium is solid, then cut to 4 mm long plastic cones and place upright into a Petri dish containing solid growth medium. \n2. Seed Germination and Seedling Growth \n Surface sterilize seeds in 5% NaOCl for 5 min, wash three times with sterile water, then place a single seed on top of each of the medium-filled cones.    \n Seal the dish  with Micropore tape (3M) and store at 4 °C to synchronize germination. \n After three days, transfer the plates to a growth cabinet to start germination. Our growth conditions are 23 °C at a 16h high light/8h dark cycle (Light intensity: 100 μE m-2 s-1). \n Between 5 and 7 days after germination, the seedlings should be ready for transfer to the RootChip. At this time, root tips should be near the bottom outlets of the plastic cones. Check seedling health, root length and, if applicable, expression of a fluorescent marker under a dissecting microscope. \n Mark individual seedlings for transfer onto the chip. Select ten or so seedlings in case one is damaged during transfer. \n3. Transfer of Seedlings onto the RootChip\n To sterilize the RootChip for long-term experiments, wrap the device in tissue paper, place in a glass Petri dish, and autoclave.",
    "Once the RootChip has cooled, cover it with liquid growth medium. The RootChip should be completely immersed, but the fluid level should be no more than 3 mm above the RootChip surface. \n With a 20 μl pipette, pull medium through the root inlet and chamber outlet to fill the observation chamber with medium. \n Plug plastic cones selected in step 2.5 into the RootChip inlets. The cones should fit snugly in the inlets. Since the RootChip is mounted on a thin layer of optical glass, do not apply too much pressure to the chip. \n Incubate the RootChip overnight in liquid medium. To prevent floating, place two glass slides onto the chip. Add a magnetic stir bar and close the dish. \n Transfer the assembly to a magnetic stirrer and gently agitate the medium. \n The RootChip's inlets intersect the channels at a 30° angle to the device normal to facilitate root growth into the channels (Figure 1A). To further support growth in the desired direction, tilt the assembly slightly by placing a glass slide under the Petri dish on the side of the chip opposite of the outlets. \n To maintain the light/ dark cycle, illuminate the seedlings with a ring lamp (Light intensity: 100 μE m-2 s-1) connected to a timer. \n4. Connecting the RootChip to the Carrier\n The following day, fill a sealable, pressurizable vial with liquid growth medium (Figure 1B).    \n Invert the chip carrier and place it on a stable surface. Remove the RootChip from the liquid medium and insert it PDMS side down into the bottom aperture of the chip carrier. Orient the chip so that the side containing the control layer inlets is facing the side of the pressure line tubing connectors in the carrier side wall.",
    "Dry the cover glass on the bottom of the chip by gently blotting with tissue paper. Secure the RootChip to the carrier with tape and right the whole assembly. \nTubing connectors are made by cutting flexible plastic microbore tubing (TYGON, 0.20\" ID x 0.060\" OD) into 5 cm long pieces and connecting them to stainless steel microbore tubes (New England Small Tube, 0.025\" OD x 0.013\" ID x 0.75\" long). Fill the tubing connectors with water using a syringe and plug each tubing connector into the corresponding control layer inlet on the chip. The water will later fill the control layer channels and be used to transmit the pressure to the micromechanical valves.\n Plug the opposite ends of the lines into the media/solution vial(s). Apply pressure to the solution vial with a syringe of air. The increased air pressure within the solution vial will force liquid into the lines. \n5. Mounting the RootChip at the Microscope\n Place the carrier onto the microscope stage. To reduce the possibility of the assembly shifting over the course of the experiment due to vibrations in the room, the carrier should fit exactly into the notches of the stage insert.   \n The chip valves and the flow of medium through the chip are controlled by air pressure. Two lines with regulators are branched off of a main pressure line - one is used to control the medium flow through the channels, and the other is connected to solenoid air valves that actuate the push-up valves of the control layer. The solenoid valves are operated from the computer via the USB valve controller (developed by Rafael Gómez-Sjöberg, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab). Close both pressure regulators before connecting the chip.",
    "Add a few ml of water to the reservoirs of the carrier to keep the humidity high within the assembly. This step should be repeated over course of longer experiments to keep the plants from drying out. Keep the volume low to minimize the amount of liquid that could be spilled onto the microscope. For long-term experiments, the outflow from the chip outlets can be guided into the reservoirs of the carrier by connecting the chip outlets to the reservoirs with microbore tubing (see step 4.4). Alternatively, the outflow that accumulates on the chip surface can be collected by pipetting. \nPrepare squared sheets of transparent plastic from sheet protectors (C-Line). Fix the transparent plastic to the carrier by double-sided tape to maintain high humidity in the assembly.\n Position the ring light over the chip and maintain the light/dark cycle. The ring light should be switched off prior to the start of any experiment that uses fluorescent markers, as the direct illumination will interfere with image collection. \n6. Operating the RootChip using the LabView Interface\nThe RootChip controller interface for the LabView software platform can be downloaded from our website http://dpb.carnegiescience.edu/technology/rootchip[href=http://dpb.carnegiescience.edu/technology/rootchip].\n The valves on the chip are closed by applying pressure to the control layer, in this case by opening the solenoid air valves. The controller interface allows actuation of the valves by clicking the button below the valve number. Bright green indicates application of pressure and closing of a chip valve (Figure 2B). Activate all three solution-inlet valves in the controller interface before opening the pressure regulators.\n    Note: The controller interface features a feedback loop, which allows monitoring of the system's status. This feature may be activated by clicking on the \"Readback\" button in the controller interface.",
    "Open the pressure regulator for the control layer and initially set to 15 psi, then open the regulator for the flow layer and initially set to 5 psi. Depending on the desired flow rate, the pressures may be adjusted later. \n Open the inlet valve for the growth medium of choice to flush the chambers with medium. \n Check flow paths under the microscope. Typically, air is trapped in the flow channels and must be removed. Additionally, the channels of the control layer still contain air that must be forced out and replaced by the water from the tubing connectors (dead-end filling). Both tasks are achieved by flushing each of the eight chambers several times (5 psi) until all air is forced from the channels into the PDMS (\"degassing\"). \n    Note: The controller interface can be programmed to automate experiments. Such routines may also be used to degas the chip. \n7. Representative Results\nThe prime purpose of the RootChip is to combine an imaging platform and a perfusion system in a single device with a high level of integration. To demonstrate the manipulation of the microenvironment of roots we flushed the chambers with dark food coloring (1:4 dilution in hydroponic medium) and measured the exchange of fluid within the chambers. At the recommended pressure of 5 psi we measured a full exchange within 10 seconds at a calculated flow rate of approximately 1.5 μl/min (Figure 3).\nWe also observed root growth of seedlings, in this case grown in the dark and supplied with 10 mM Glucose as an external energy source (Figure 4). Depending on the growth conditions such as light and composition of the medium, plants can be observed in the RootChip for up to three days.",
    "The RootChip has been used to monitor intracellular glucose and galactose levels in roots expressing genetically encoded nanosensors, based on Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)5-7. Roots in the chip were perfused with square pulses of glucose or galactose solution (Figure 5). The intracellular levels of sugars were monitored and are shown here expressed as a ratio of the intensity of the acceptor fluorophore Citrine to the intensity of the donor ECFP. The rise in ratio indicates accumulation of sugar.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4290/4290fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. RootChip principle.\n The RootChip features eight observation chambers for the growth and imaging of roots. The seeds first germinate in plastic cones - fabricated from plastic pipette tips - which are filled with solid medium. The root tip grows through the medium and reaches the chamber where a continuous flow of liquid medium keeps the conditions in the chamber constant. Micromechanical valves (red) control the flow. The chip is mounted on an optical cover glass. \n  Drawing not to scale.

An example for a valve setting to guide the fluid flow to a single chamber is shown. While valves 4 through 8 act as single valves, valves 0 through 3 act in groups. With this system an individual chamber can be addressed by activating a combination of valves. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4290/4290fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
