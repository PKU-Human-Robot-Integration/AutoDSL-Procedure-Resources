    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nNuclease/sgRNA Delivery Method\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThe purpose of this step is to deliver base editors and sgRNA vectors into hiPSCs. The transfected cells are subsequently selected with antibiotics (puromycin in this protocol).\nA. Plating Cells\nFor feeder-free culture, hiPSCs are maintained on matrigel in mTeSR1 medium. The day before transfection, hiPSCs should reach 60%–80% confluency.\nRemove the 6-well plate from the incubator and aspirate the mTeSR1 medium. Add 1 mL of PBS and aspirate it.\nNext, add 0.5 mL of (pre-warmed) Accutase (3 times dilution with PBS, final concentration, 16.7 ug/mL) to the well, and treat it for 6 min in a 37°C incubator for detachment.\nWhen each colony is ∼80%–90% detached, dissociate the colonies into single cells by resuspending them with 2 mL mTeSR1.\nPipette the mixture up and down 6–8 times and centrifuge it at 1500 rpm (300 g) for 3 min at 25 °C. At the same time, count the number of cells in a 10 μL volume using a hemocytometer.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in mTeSR1 at a final density equal to 1*104 cells/ul.\nPlate 4 × 105 cells in 6-well plate coated with matrigel by 2 mL mTeSR1 medium supplemented with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor to each well (Y-27632; STEMCELL Technologies).\nB. Transfection of Base Editors and sgRNA-Expressing Vectors\nCritical: Transfection should be conducted within 24 hours after plating to ensure the cells are actively dividing.\nRecover lipofectamine and opti-MEM medium to 25°C.\nCell density should reach 60% confluency on the day after plating. Change the medium to fresh mTeSR1.\nDilute 12 ul Lipofectamine LTX Reagent in 125 ul Opti-MEM Medium and mix well with a pipette.",
    "Dilute Lenti-V2-AIDx-nSaCas9 (KKH)-Ugi (2.5 ug) and pCDNA3 Ugi (0.5 ug) in 125 ul Opti-MEM Medium, then add 2.5 ul PLUS Reagent and mix well with a pipette.\nAdd diluted DNA to diluted Lipofectamine LTX Reagent (1:1 ratio) and mix well with a pipette.\nIncubate for 5 min at 25°C.\nAdd DNA-lipid complex dropwise and evenly to cells.\nIncubate cells for 2 days at 37°C.\nC. Antibiotic Selection\nCritical: To determine the minimum antibiotic concentration to select transfected cells over the course of one week, a killing curve of untransfected cells is highly recommended with every selection antibiotic when used for the first time or used on a new cell line (Steps 1-3).\nPlate 1*105 cells in 0.5 mL complete mTeSR1 medium with 10 μM ROCK inhibitor per well in a 24-well tissue culture plate coated with matrigel one day prior to antibiotic selection. Ideally cells should reach ∼60% confluence prior to the antibiotic selection.\nAdd increasing amounts of the antibiotic (e.g., 0, 0.25, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 μg/mL puromycin) to duplicate wells of cells plated in complete mTeSR1 media.\nObserve the cells under a light microscope until cells die out within 7 days. The duration of culture may be extended to 14 days depending on the cell line used.\n2 days after transfection, change the medium to fresh mTeSR1 supplemented with 2 μg/mL puromycin and 10 μM ROCK inhibitor.\nSelect for 3 days and then change the medium every day.\n5–10 days after the transfection, collect half of the cells for analysis of induced mutations and keep the remaining cells for single-cell clone isolation and downstream function test.\nD. Single-Cell Clone Isolation",
    "Plate single cell suspension at low densities (1x104-3x104 cells per 10cm dish in 6 mL mTeSR1 plus 10 mM ROCK inhibitor). Change the culture medium every day.\nTen days later, single cells should grow into small cell masses which are detached to each other.\nAspirate the supernatant and add 15 mL PBS.\nIncubate for 10 min at 37°C to detach the cells gently.\nTransfer the individual cell mass gently into a well of 48-well plates under a light microscope.\nE. Genomic DNA Extraction\nNote: Genomic DNA is extracted with MicroElute Genomic DNA Kit (Omega) following the manufacturer’s instructions.\nNote: DNA Wash Buffer Concentrate must be diluted with absolute ethanol before use.\nNote: Work at 25 °C unless stated otherwise.\nRe-suspend the sample cell pellet (no less than 1*105 to avoid low yield) volume with 100 ul with PBS Buffer.\nAdd 20 ul of Protease solution (included in the kit) and mix well by vortexing.\nAdd 120 ul Buffer BL and vortex to mix. Incubate at 70°C for 10 min. If there are less than 1x105 cells, 4 ul of Linear acrylamide is recommended to be added to each sample (Linear Polyacrylamide is an efficient neutral carrier for precipitating picogram amounts of nucleic acids with ethanol).\nAdd 120 ul absolute ethanol and mix thoroughly by vortexing for 15 s at maxi speed. Bring down any liquid drop from inside of lid by brief centrifugation.\nAssemble a HiBind® MicroElute column in a 2 mL collection tube (provided with the kit).\nTransfer the entire solution from Step 4 into the column, including any precipitate that may have formed. Close the lid and centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 1 min at 25°C to bind DNA. Discard the collection tube and flow-through liquid.",
    "Place the column into a new collection tube (supplied). Add 500 ul of Buffer HB in the column. Close the lid and centrifuge at 8000 x g for 1 min at 25°C. Discard the flow-through and re-use the collection tube.\nPlace the column into the same 2 mL tube (supplied) and wash by pipetting 650 ul of DNA Wash Buffer diluted with ethanol. Centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 1 min at 25°C. Again, dispose of the collection tube and flow-through liquid.\nUsing a new collection tube, wash the column with a second 650 ul of DNA Wash Buffer diluted with ethanol and centrifuge as above. Discard flow-through and re-use the collection tube.\nUsing the same 2 mL collection tube, centrifuge empty column at maximum speed (≥20,000 x g) for 3 min to dry the HiBind® membrane.\nCritical: This step is crucial for ensuring optimal elution in the following step.\nPlace the column into a sterile 1.5 mL microfuge tube and add 10-50 ul of preheated (70°C) Elution Buffer or water onto the center of the membrane. Allow tubes to sit for 3 min at 25°C.\nTo elute DNA from the column, centrifuge at 20,000 x g for 1 min.\nThe DNA concentration is measured with a NanoDrop. We typically get ∼25 ug gDNA from 1*106 cells.\nAlternatives: Incubation at 70°C rather than 25 °C will give a modest increase in DNA yield per elution.\nAlternatives: the second elution may be performed using the first eluate or using the second 10-50 ul of preheated Elution Buffer or water.\nNGS Library Preparation\nTiming: 1 day\nThe goal of this step is to quantitively analyze the editing efficiencies using high-throughput sequencing.\nA. Primary PCR Amplification\nNote: See Before you Begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section for notes on primer design.",
    "Critical: Work on ice unless stated otherwise.\nIf desired, normalize samples to a consistent concentration (concentration (100 ng/ul) in a sterile 1.5 mL microfuge tube. Always include DNA from un-edited cells as controls.\nVortex samples to mix and spin-down in a centrifuge.\nThaw the Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase kit reagents.\nCritical: Remember to vortex and centrifuge the plate(s) and reagents (when thawed) before using them.\nMake a 1 x Phusion® PCR master mix using the following recipe (see below):\n10 μL 5x HF buffer\n4 μL 2.5 mM dNTPs\n0.5 μL Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase\n2.5 μL forward primer (dilute stock(100uM) to 10 uM)\n2.5 μL reverse primer (dilute stock(100uM) to 10 uM).\n29.5 μL Nuclease-free water\nAdd 1 μL DNA template (100 ng/ul) to the PCR mix, mix and spin down.\nRun the following PCR protocol on the PCR machine. Typically, this should be run for 25 cycles and stopped at the end of the final extension phase.\nCycling Conditions:\n98°C – 30 s\n25-35 cycles of:\n98°C – 10 s\n55°C – 20 s\n72°C – 10 min\nHold at 4°C\nThe PCR product can be Sanger sequenced to determine if the desired mutations occur in the edited cells.\nRun 5 μL of PCR product on the agarose gel to confirm the size.\nB. First PCR Clean Up\nBring the AMPure XP beads to 25°C. The AMPure XP beads are paramagnetic beads to selectively bind nucleic acids by type and size which are powered by patented Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization (SPRI) technology.\nVortex the AMPure XP beads for 30 s to make sure that the beads are evenly dispersed. Add an equal volume of beads with the PCR product to the 1.5 mL microfuge tube.\nGently pipette entire volume up and down 10 times.",
    "Incubate at 21°C without shaking for 5 min.\nPlace 1.5 mL microfuge tube on a magnetic stand for 2 min or until the supernatant has cleared.\nWith 1.5 mL microfuge tube on the magnetic stand, use a pipette to remove and discard the supernatant. Change tips between samples.\nWith 1.5 mL microfuge tube on the magnetic stand, wash the beads with freshly prepared 80% ethanol. Incubate the tube on the magnetic stand for 30 s. Carefully remove and discard the supernatant.\nWith 1.5 mL microfuge tube on the magnetic stand, perform a second ethanol wash.\nWith 1.5 mL microfuge tube still on the magnetic stand, allow the beads to air-dry for 10 min.\nRemove 1.5 mL microfuge tube from the magnetic stand. add 25 μL of ddH2O to each well of the tube.\nGently mix with pipette up and down 10 times, changing tips after each tube.\nIncubate at 25°C for 2 min.\nPlace 1.5 mL microfuge tube on the magnetic stand for 2 min or until the supernatant has cleared. Carefully transfer 20 μL of the supernatant from 1.5 mL microfuge tube to a new one.\nC. Indexing PCR\nDetermine an i5 and i7 dual-indexing scheme and ensure no index conflicts between samples to be pooled for sequencing (e.g., N701 and N702). The HiSeq and MiSeq Systems use a green laser to sequence G/T and a red laser to sequence A/C. At each cycle at least 1 of 2 nucleotides for each color channel must be read to ensure proper registration.\nCritical: It is important to maintain color balance for each base of the Index Read being sequenced, otherwise, Index Read sequencing may fail due to registration failure of clusters.\nThaw the Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (New England Biolab, MA) kit reagents.",
    "Critical: Remember to vortex and centrifuge reagents (when thawed) before using them.\nMake a 1 x Phusion® PCR master mix using the following recipe:\n10 μL 5x HF buffer\n4 μL 2.5 mM dNTPs\n0.5 μL Phusion® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase\n2.5 μL forward primer (dilute stock(100uM) to 10 uM)\n2.5 μL reverse primer (dilute stock(100uM) to 10 uM).\n25.5 μL Nuclease-free water\nAdd 5 μL template to the PCR mix.\nRun the following PCR protocol on the BioRad Tetrad (or equivalent PCR machine). Typically, this should be run for 5-8 cycles and stopped at the end of the final extension phase.\nCycling Conditions:\n98°C – 30 s\n5 cycles of 98°C – 10 s\n55°C – 20 s\n72°C – 10 min\nHold at 4°C\nNote: Total PCR cycles should be limited to 33 cycles.\nRun 5 μL of PCR product on the agarose gel to check product size.\nD. Second PCR Clean Up\nRepeat steps B.1-B.13 above.\nThe library can be analyzed for quality, quantification, and sent to high-throughput sequencing. A good quality library should only contain desired PCR products without primer dimers. The 170 bp primer dimers indicated as below should be removed and the size of the amplicon should be consistent with what is expected (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/17-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.
