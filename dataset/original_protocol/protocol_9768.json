    "NOTE: Experiment design and ethical approval were obtained from UCL Institutional Review Board (IRB). All experiments were carried out as per regulation of Home Office and guidelines of Animals (scientific procedure) Act 1986 with revised legislation of European Directive 2010/63/EU (2013). Rabbits were inspected by a named veterinary surgeon (NVS) periodically and twice in a day by a named animal care and welfare officer (NACWO) (As per guidelines and regulations of Home office). They did not show any sign of pain until they were euthanized.\n1. Preparation of Tissue Engineered Tendon (ET) Graft\nTo fabricate the collagen hydrogel, add 4 mL of rat tail collagen type 1 monomeric collagen solution (2.15 mg/mL in 0.6% acetic acid with 0.2% w/v of total protein) and 500 µL of 10x Minimal Essential Medium. Neutralize this by titrating against 5 M and 1 M sodium hydroxide and add 500 µL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM).\nPour 5 mL of this solution into a custom built rectangular metal mold (33 mm × 22 mm × 10 mm, 120 g weight) (Figure 1). Keep the mold in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 15 minutes to allow matrix assembly19.\n2. Fabrication of the Graft\nAfter polymerization, remove the collagen hydrogel from the mold and place in a standard plastic compression assembly (Figure 2A)19.\nPlace the collagen hydrogel in between two 50 µm nylon mesh sheets and apply a static load of 120 g (total surface area 7.4 cm2, which is a pressure equivalent to 1.6 kPa) for 5 minutes to remove interstitial fluid from the hydrogel (Figure 2A). Use four layers of filter paper to absorb the discharged fluid from hydrogels.",
    "Use four layers of compressed gels rolled on top of each other (Figure 2B) and cut into 15 mm segments (Figure 2C) to fabricate the ET.\n\tNOTE: New Zeland white male rabbits of age 16 - 25 weeks were used in the experiments.\nSedate animals with an intramuscular (i.m.) dose of Hypnorm (0.3 mg/mL) and euthanize by administering an overdose of pentobarbitone.\nImmediately after euthanasia, trim the hair on both hind legs. Then with a size 20 surgical blade, make a 9 cm incision around the inferior tibiofibular area to expose the tibialis posterior (TP) tendon.\nWith the same sized surgical blade, excise lapine TP tendons with an average length of 70 mm and keep moist in PBS during the experimental process to avoid drying.\n3. Developed Novel Tenorrhaphy Technique\nNOTE: The sutures (see Table of Materials) are non-absorbable and made from an isotactic crystalline stereoisomer of polypropylene, which is a synthetic linear polyolefin. The core interlocking sutures were mainly consisting of 3-0 and the peripheral sutures were 6-0. These were the two main sutures used in all experiments.\nWith a surgical blade, cut the TP tendon at the midpoint. Excise a 15 mm segment of the tendon from the middle of the tendon and replace it with the ET collagen graft (Figure 2D). Interlock the 3-0 suture proximally away from native tendon ends (Figure 3A).\nPass the 3-0 core sutures above the entire length of the graft and interlock distally away from the cut end.\nSecure both ends of the ET to the native tendon with 6-0 and continuous running sutures around the periphery by coupling two tendon ends (Figure 3B). This is done so that the graft can be moved easily on the suture by placing tension on the native tendon20.",
    "After securing the suture as described above, manually ensure that the tension on the sutures is appropriate and that there is no flaccidity in the entirety of the suture.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
