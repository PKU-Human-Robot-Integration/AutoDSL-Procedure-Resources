    "Preparation of TissuePrepare a 4% PFA solution in PBS.Fix mouse tissue by cardiac perfusion with 4% PFA solution.Carefully dissect out the brain and transfer to a 7 ml bijou.Post-fix in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C.Wash the brain in PBS 3 times for 10 min eachNote: Brains can be stored in PBS at 4 °C for a period of weeks. For long term storage at 4 °C 0.01% sodium azide should be added.Vibratome CuttingPrepare a 2% agarose solution in H2O.Heat the 2% agarose solution in a microwave until in solution and allow to cool until bottle can be held comfortably while the solution is still liquid.Position the brain in an embedding peel-a-way mould or homemade mould made from tinfoil (see Figure 1A).Pour the cooled agarose solution over the brain and reposition.Leave for at least 5 min until the agarose solution has set.Trim down excess agarose using a blade and glue the brain in agarose onto the vibratome specimen holder positioned so that the angle of the vibratome blade will cut flat coronal sections (see Figures 1B-1C).Secure the specimen holder onto the vibratome (see Figure 1C).Fill the buffer tray with PBS until the agarose is covered.Cut 100 µm coronal sections of the desired brain regions using a speed of 5 and frequency of 7.Carefully collect sections with a paintbrush and transfer to the wells of 24-well plate containing PBS (see Figure 1D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201014/20201014104030_2883.jpgFigure 1.

    "ImmunofluorescenceUsing a paintbrush carefully transfer the brains sections to Eppendorf tubes contacting 1 ml of antigen retrieval buffer (10 mM citrate, 0.05% Tween, pH 6).Transfer tubes to a preheated heat block set at 95 °C for 20 min.Carefully remove sections from the tubes and transfer back to PBS in a 24-well plate.Using a pastette or P100 pipette carefully remove the PBS and add 250 µl blocking buffer (10% goat serum, 0.25% triton, in PBS) to each well. Leave for 2 h at room temperature on a shaker.Remove blocking buffer and add primary CNPase antibody (1:2,000) in blocking buffer for 36-48 h at 4 °C on a shaker.Note: Other primary antibodies can be used in conjunction with CNPase, see materials and reagents section for suggestions. Remove primary antibody and wash sections with PBS 3 x 1 h at room temperature on a shaker.Remove PBS and add Alexa fluorophore-conjugated mouse secondary antibody (1:1,000) in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C on a shaker.Remove secondary antibodies and wash sections in PBS for 3 x 1 h at room temperature.Stain with a nuclear marker for 20 min at room temperature.Mount sections on to superfrost slides using fluoromount G and secure with cover glass.Analysis of Myelin Sheath Number and LengthUsing a confocal microscope at 63x magnification and a z step size of 0.5 µm, image individual CNPase positive oligodendrocytes in the sparsely myelinated layers II-III of the mouse cortex (Figure 2).Note: Prior to imaging, slides and images should be suitably blinded, e.g., using the filename randomiser plugin on Fiji.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201014/20201014102142_3646.jpgFigure 2. The sparsely myelinated upper layers of the mouse grey matter. Layers II-III and IV (dashed area) of the mouse cortex is sparsely myelinated. Due to this oligodendrocyte morphologies, the number and length of myelin sheaths generated, can be assessed.",
    "In the deeper layers of the cortex and white matter, the number of oligodendrocytes does not allow confident analysis of myelination. CNPase–green, Hoechst–blue. Scale bar = 100 µm.Open ImageJ–Fiji. Select Plugins ➔ Segmentation ➔ Simple neurite tracer.Note: Check here[href=https://imagej.net/Simple_Neurite_Tracer] for more detailed instructions on how to use simple neurite tracer. Using simple neurite tracer move through the z-stack and follow the thin processes connecting the cell body to the myelin sheaths–signal intensity is much brighter in myelin sheaths compared to the fine processes (Figure 3).Note: Only analyze oligodendrocytes with all complete myelin sheaths present within the 100 µm section as assessed by following each process from the cell body and ensuring none exit the section. To achieve this aim to image cells in the middle of the 100 µm section.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20201014/20201014102203_8308.jpgFigure 3. Thin CNPase positive processes connect cell body (asterisk) to myelin sheaths (arrowheads depicting start and end of example sheaths).To measure a myelin sheath in 3-dimensions click at the start of a myelin sheath. The start of a sheath can be defined where bright sheath signal begins but not the end of the section or image. Move through the z-stack and follow the sheath. Click along the sheath and accept the path (y) if the sheath has traced correctly or cancel (n) if incorrect. At the end of a sheath select finish path (f). Ends of sheaths can be defined where signal ends but not the end of the section or image.Note: Ends of myelin sheaths can also be confirmed with Caspr staining, see materials and methods for a Caspr antibody. The length in microns of completed sheaths are recorded in the “All Paths” box.Return to the oligodendrocyte cell body and trace another process to a different sheath and measure as above.",
    "When all sheaths from one cell have been measured, select “File” from the tracing window, then “Export as CSV…”A Microsoft Excel file will be created containing the lengths of myelin sheaths measured.Note: In wild type mice we have observed oligodendrocytes generate an average of 50 myelin sheaths per cell with a range from 25-70. Myelin sheaths length can range from 5 µm up to over 150 µm."
