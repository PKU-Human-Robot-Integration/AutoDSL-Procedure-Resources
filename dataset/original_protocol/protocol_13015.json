  "procedures": [
    "The present protocol is approved by the Ethics Committee on the Use of Animals in Research, CCS/UFRJ (CEUA-101/19), and National Institutes of Health guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. The sciatic nerve is isolated from four-month-old male C57BL/6 mice, euthanized by cervical dislocation as per the institutional guidelines. The protocol steps are optimized to avoid mitochondrial deterioration. Therefore, in this protocol, calibration of polarographic oxygen sensors was performed prior to mouse sciatic nerve tissue dissection and permeabilization.\n1. Preparation of reagents\nPrepare the Tissue Preservation Buffer (TP Buffer).\n\t\nPrepare the following reagents in ultrapure water solution: 10 mM of Ca-EGTA buffer with 0.1 μM of free calcium, 20 mM of imidazole, 20 mM of taurine, 50 mM of K-MES, 0.5 mM of DTT, 6.56 mM of MgCl2, 5.77 mM of ATP, 15 mM of phosphocreatine (see Table of Materials), pH 7.1. Store at -20°C.\nPrepare the Mitochondria Respiration Buffer (MR Buffer).\n\t\nPrepare the following reagents in ultrapure water solution: 0.5 mM of K2EGTA, 3 mM of MgCl2, 60 mM of MES, 20 mM of taurine, 10 mM of KH2PO4, 20 mM of HEPES, 110 mM of D-sucrose, 1 mg/mL of BSA (fatty acid-free) (see Table of Materials), pH 7.4. Store at -20 °C.\nPrepare saponin stock solution by dissolving 5 mg of saponin (see Table of Materials) in 1 mL of TP Buffer (step 1.1) and keep it on ice. Saponin is prepared freshly.\nPrepare Amplex Red by resuspending the powder (see Table of Materials) with DMSO to obtain a stock concentration of 2 mM and store at -20 °C in a vial protected from light.\n\t​NOTE: To avoid wearing out the probe by freezing and thawing, make small aliquots for storage no longer than 6 months25.\n2. Calibration of polarographic oxygen sensors for high-resolution respirometry (HRR)",
    "Clean the HRR chambers of the instrument and syringes (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nOpen HRR chambers, fill with distilled water up to the top and stir for 5 min 3x. Repeat with ethanol and then again with water. Wash stoppers and syringes with water/ethanol/water 3x each.\nApply the following calibration settings in the HRR software (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nIn HRR software control, add the experimental temperature (37 °C), the parameters for oxygen sensor (gain, 2; polarization voltage, 800 mV), and for amperometric sensor (gain, 1000; polarization voltage, 100 mV).\nCalibrate the oxygen sensors.\n\t\nPipette 2.1 mL of MR Buffer (step 1.2) into each chamber. Close with the stoppers and draw air into the chamber until a bubble is formed. Stir at 37 °C for 1 h in calibration mode until the oxygen flux per mass is stable.\nPerform an air calibration of the polarographic oxygen sensors in the software according to the manufacturer's protocol24.\n\t\t​NOTE: The calibration step is only performed once before an experiment. Additional experiments in the same respiration medium and temperature can be performed after merely washing chambers (step 2.1).\n3. Dissection and permeabilization of the sciatic nerve\nRemove the sciatic nerve following the steps below.\n\t\nEuthanize the animal by cervical dislocation after removing from its cage and gently restrained to resting on the bench.\nIn the euthanized animal, make an incision with scissors in the lower back, starting near the spine and proceeding down the thigh toward the foot. Remove skin and muscle attached to the nerve, and then cut and remove the entire sciatic nerve.\nWeigh the tissue immediately and place it in a vial filled with cold TB Buffer (4 °C). Perform steps 3.2-3.3 on ice.",
    "NOTE: The wet tissue weight is used to normalize oxygen consumption and ROS production flow in the following steps. If the tissue cannot be weighed immediately, conserve it in cold TB Buffer. The procedure is performed in fresh tissue and must not be frozen to avoid mitochondrial damage.\nFor the tissue preparation, place the sciatic nerve in a Petri dish with enough TP Buffer to cover it. Hold one end of the nerve with forceps, and with another pair of forceps, pull out the nerve bundles horizontally.\n\tNOTE: This procedure needs to be done in less than 10 min to avoid tissue deterioration. The tissue will be ready when it can be visualized as transparent foggy layers, opposite the previous white opaque tissue (Figure 1).\nFirst, transfer the splayed tissue into a small dish containing 1 mL of TP Buffer for tissue permeabilization. To start permeabilization, transfer the tissue with forceps to a dish containing 1 mL of TP Buffer and 10 µL of saponin (from stock solution, step 1.3).\n\t\nShake in a microplate shaker gently for 30 min, then transfer the tissue with forceps to a fresh dish containing MR Buffer (1 mL) and shake gently for 10 min. Transfer the tissue with forceps to a calibrated HRR chamber.\n4. Oxygen consumption and ROS production determination\nFill the HRR chambers with 2.1 mL of MR Buffer, add Amplex Red (step 1.4) to a final concentration of 5 µM and peroxidase to 2 U/mL, and add the permeabilized sciatic nerve (step 3).\n\t\nAttach the instrument's fluorescence sensors, turn off the lights in the control section of the software, and press Connect to oxygraph. In \"edit protocols\" in the software, insert the tissue weight measured in step 3.1.3.",
    "Go to \"layout\", choose the \"specific flux per unit sample\" option, and select Plots to simultaneously access the oxygen consumption readout and, if desired, the H2O2 production. Wait ~10 min.\n\tNOTE: This time is required to stabilize the basal flow of oxygen consumption with no added substrate (basal). Before further injections, ensure that the oxygen flow is stabilized.\nInject two pulses of H2O2, each one to a final concentration of 260 µM, for later calibration in the chamber.\nInject 20 μL of succinate (see Table of Materials), a mitochondrial complex II substrate, to activate the mitochondrial electron transport system.\n\tNOTE: Different mitochondrial substrates can be added at this point to evaluate mitochondrial function by different complexes. Representative results with varying substrates for mitochondrial complexes I and II are shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. At this point, an increase in O2 consumption and H2O2 production, simultaneously, is observed in Figure 3.\nAdd 20 µL of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to activate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis.\n\tNOTE: ADP stimulates ATP synthesis and reduces the membrane potential. An increase in O2 consumption and a decrease in the production of H2O2 are expected to be observed26,27.\nIn sequence, add 5 µL of cytochrome c (see Table of Materials) as an indicator of membrane integrity.\n\tNOTE: If the tissue is well prepared and permeabilized, cytochrome c should not increase oxygen consumption by more than 15%. If it occurs, check the troubleshooting section for recommendations.\nTitrate with aliquots of 0.2 µg/mL of oligomycin (see Table of Materials) until no further decrease in O2 consumption is observed.\n\tNOTE: Oligomycin acts by inhibiting ATP synthesis leading to a decrease in O2 flow and an enhancement in H2O2 formation favored by the high membrane potential26,27.",
    "Titrate with aliquots of 0.5 µmol/L of carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) (see Table of Materials), the mitochondrial uncoupler, until it is possible to observe no further increase in O2 consumption. To finish the experiment, inject 2 µl of antimycin A to a final concentration of 5 μM and wait for flow stabilization.\n\tNOTE: A decrease in H2O2 production is observed due to the membrane potential dissipation after injecting FCCP. Antimycin A inhibits complex III, thereby preventing the flow of electrons. Therefore, mitochondria-dependent O2 consumption is impaired, decreasing oxygen flux per mass and stimulating electron leakage, increasing H2O2 production26,27.\nGo to the command bar, search for \"multisensory\" in the software, click on Control > Save file and Disconnect.\n\tNOTE: The addition of other substrates and inhibitors can be performed according to the question under study. An example is described in the representative results. H2O2 calibration is performed after finishing the experiment, according to the manufacturer's protocol28.\nOpen the saved file and select the \"Oxygen Flux per Mass\" trace to obtain the experimental oxygen consumption results. Manually select the window between injections by pressing Shift + Left mouse button.\n\t\nGo to Marks > Statistics to visualize the results for each injection of substrate/inhibitors/uncoupled protocol. For H2O2 production, perform the same procedure with the \"Amp-Slope\" trace.\n\t\tNOTE: When selecting the window, avoid artifacts of volume injections by choosing a window where oxygen (or H2O2) is more stable and constant. Examples of selected windows are represented by black braces in the representative results (Figure 2 and Figure 3).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
