    "German Landrace pigs (wild type bred in a local farmhouse and transgenic bred at the Institute of Molecular Animal Breeding and Biotechnology, Ludwig-Maximilian University, Munich, Germany), weighing between 30 kg to 40 kg, were used in this study. All animals were housed under standard conditions with water and food ad lib. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with the U.K. Animals Act (scientific procedures) and the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, as well as the Swiss animal protection law. All animal studies complied with the ARRIVE guidelines. The animal experimentation committee of the cantonal veterinary service (Canton of Bern, Switzerland) approved all animal procedures, permission no. BE70/14. Experimental protocols were refined according to the 3R principles and state-of-the-art anesthesia and pain management were used to minimize the number of animals and reduce the exposure of the animals to stress and pain during the experiments.\nBlood was drawn from healthy individuals by closed system venipuncture in accordance with Swiss jurisdiction and ethics guidelines of the Bern University Hospital. The phrase \"non-anticoagulated blood\" means that the blood has not been treated with any anticoagulant.\nThe following steps are performed under sterile conditions. Familiarity with basic cell culture sterile technique is required.\n1. Isolation of PAEC\nNOTE: Thoracic aorta segments of 6 to 10 cm were obtained from euthanized German Landrace pigs of 3 to 6 months of age (used for other in vivo experiments) and immediately transferred into a 500-mL glass bottle containing transport medium (DMEM + 1% penicillin/streptomycin).\nPre-coat a 6-well plate with fibronectin 12.5 µg/mL in PBS 1x and place it in an incubator at 37 °C for 1 h.\nPre-warm sterile PBS 1x and cell culture medium (DMEM).\nTake out the porcine aorta from transport medium.\nPlace the aorta on a polystyrene plate.",
    "Flush with warm PBS gently beforehand.\nCut the aorta longitudinally and fix it with needles.\nAdd warm cell culture medium on the inner vessel surface.\nAspirate fibronectin-cell culture medium and add fresh cell culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 0.4% of Endothelial Cell Growth Medium Supplement Mix).\nSoak one cotton swab in the cell culture medium. Swab the cotton wool bud on the very top of the inner vessel surface gently and slowly in the same direction.\nRub the cells in one well of 6-well plate round by round.\nDo the same for the rest of the wells.\nCheck cells under the microscope and place the 6-well plate in incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nChange the medium on the second day and change it again every 2 - 3 days.\nWhen cells are going to be confluent, trypsinize cells and seed them into a T75 flask (PAEC P1).\n2. PAEC Characterization\nPre-coat an 8-well chamberslide with fibronectin 12.5 µg/mL in PBS 1x and place it in an incubator at 37 °C for 1 h.\nSeed 5 x 104 cells/well and incubate overnight in the incubator at 37 °C.\nWash the cells twice with PBS++(PBS supplemented with CaCl2 and MgCl2), 300 μL/well.\nFix cells with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, 200 μL/well.\nWash cells 3 times with PBS++, 300 μL/well.\nAdd 300 μL of PBS 1x-3% BSA (blocking buffer) and leave 30 min at room temperature.\nApply primary antibodies (anti-VE-cadherin, anti-CD31, anti-vWF) diluted in PBS 1x-1%BSA-0.05% detergent, 160 μL/well and incubate for 1 h at room temperature.\nWash 3 times with PBS++ (200 μL/well).\nApply secondary antibodies and DAPI diluted in PBS 1x-1%BSA-0.05% detergent, 160 μL/well, and incubate for 1 h at room temperature.\nWash 3 times with PBS++ (200 μL/well).",
    "Mount slides with glycerol based mounting medium and verify endothelial cell markers expression under a fluorescence microscope.\n\tNOTE: Culture porcine aortic endothelial cells in a T175 flask (DMEM low glucose medium + 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 0.4% of Endothelial Cell Growth Medium Supplement Mix) until 90% confluence is reached. (seeding density 1 x 106 cells, 90% confluence correspond roughly to 5 x 106 cells).\n3. Coating of Microcarrier Beads\nMix 7 mL of microcarrier beads with 42 mL of collagen solution in a 50-mL tube (100 μg/mL, diluted in a 0.2% acetic acid solution) and incubate for 1 h at room temperature.\nWash beads two times with 25 mL of PBS pH 7.4 (add 25 mL of PBS, mix well with the pipet and wait until the beads are settled down then discard the supernatant and repeat) and one time with 25 mL of DMEM medium.\nCover the beads in the 50-mL tube with 10mL of medium 199 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-Glutamine, 0.4% of Endothelial Cell Growth Medium Supplement Mix and 25 μL of heparin (5000 IU/mL) and allow equilibration for 10 min before further use.\n4. Collecting Cells\nRemove the cell culture medium from the T175 flask containing PAEC and add 5 mL of PBS pH 7.4.\nRemove PBS from the T175 flask.\nAdd 5 mL of Trypsin-0.05% EDTA and incubate for 3 - 4 min at 37 °C.\nCollect the cells by rinsing the flask with 15 mL of cell culture medium and transfer the suspension in a 50-mL tube.\nCentrifuge cells at 1,200 x g for 8 min at room temperature, remove excess medium and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of cell culture medium.\n5. Seeding Cells into the Stirrer Flask",
    "Add 20 mL of cell culture medium to the cell suspension and resuspend.\nAdd 20 mL cell culture medium (w/o cells) into the 500-mL magnetic stirrer flask.\nAdd the cells to the washed microcarrier beads from step 3.3 and mix carefully with a 25-mL serological pipette.\nTransfer the beads/cell mixture into the magnetic spinner flask.\nRinse the 50-mL tube with 10 mL of cell culture medium to collect the remaining cells.\nAdd an additional 85 mL of cell culture medium into the spinner flask and place it into the incubator overnight at 37 °C on a shaker (100 x g, mixing interval: 3 min every 45 min).\nAdd 50 mL of cell culture medium (total volume 200 mL) and continue stirring for additional 24 h at 37 °C on a shaker (100 x g, mixing interval: 3 min every 45 min).\nAdd colorless RPMI medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-Glutamine, 0.4% of Endothelial Cell Growth Medium Supplement Mix and 25 μL of Heparin) until 320 mL of total volume is reached.\nReplace the medium every 48 h: Remove 100 mL of old medium and add 100 mL of fresh supplemented colorless RPMI.\nCulture the cells for 5 to 7 days. The time depends on the confluence state of the cell-coated beads.\n6. Confluence Verification\nCollect 200 μL of cell-coated beads using a pipette and transfer them into a polypropylene tube.\nWash the beads 3 times with 600 μL of PBS 1x (add PBS, tilt the tube and mix gently to avoid detachment of the cells, wait the beads to settle down, discard the PBS and repeat).\nFix the beads for 10 min by adding 200 μL of parapicric acid.\nWash 3 times with 600 μL of PBS 1x.",
    "Add DAPI diluted in PBS 1x and incubate for 10 min.\nTransfer the beads on a glass slide and apply a coverslip using glycerol based mounting medium.\nVisualize the beads under a confocal microscope.\n7. Experimental Procedure\nRemove the cell-coated beads from the magnetic stirrer flask (procedures do not have to be done under sterile conditions) with a 10-mL serological pipette and transfer them into 12 mL round-bottom polypropylene tubes.\nLet the beads settle down (around 1 - 2 min) and remove excess medium.\nAdd more beads to the tubes until every tube contains exactly 2 mL of beads.\nAdd 5-mL clear RPMI to each tube and mix carefully using a 10-mL serological pipette.\nLet the beads settle down and remove excess medium.\nRepeat the washing procedure one more time with RPMI and remove all excess medium.\n8. Incubation with Non-anticoagulated Blood\nCarefully and slowly (using neither jet nor vacutainers) draw blood from a healthy volunteer and collect it in 9 mL neutral polypropylene tubes (no anticoagulant).\nSlowly transfer 8 mL of blood with a 10-mL serological pipette into each of the polypropylene tubes containing 2 mL of cell-coated beads (the total volume will be 10 mL). Always avoid rough handling of blood or beads to avoid premature EC activation. The procedure takes 1 - 2 min.\nCarefully tilt the blood/bead mixture to ensure equal mixing and seal the cap with paraffin film.\nPlace the tubes on a horizontal tilting table (with gentle tilting settings only) inside a 37 °C incubator and record clotting times.\n\t\nAt set time intervals, e.g. after 10, 20, 30, 50, 70, 90 min, remove at least 1.5 - 2 mL of blood-bead mixture for serum or plasma analysis.",
    "NOTE: for 6 time points we suggest having more than 3 replicates within one group of cells, as the blood sampling will be done in different tubes.\nFor collection of serum, leave the blood to coagulate. To collect the plasma, add EDTA or citrate to 2 mL tubes before adding blood samples.\nStore the tubes on ice, centrifuge at 2,500 x g for 10 min at 4 °C and store serum/plasma at 80 °C until use.\n\t\tNOTE: Details on materials are provided in Table of Materials\nSubscription Required.
