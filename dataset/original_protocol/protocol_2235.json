    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe broadband dielectric spectrometer Novocontrol Alpha analyzer is equipped with a WinDETA software where experimental conditions are programmed and from which the machine can be controlled remotely (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). Below is described the detailed of the different steps that take place during the two days experimental course but once the sample is loaded, the experiment programmed on WinDETA and the dielectric measurement started using WinDETA, the user does not need to perform anything. The change of temperatures, frequencies, incubation times is programmed and controlled by the WinDETA software.\nPart 1: Controls\nTiming: 1 day\nThe first day, after preparing the samples, perform dielectric measurements to control the membrane, the water and set up appropriate experimental conditions for the protein thermal unfolding.\nControl of empty membrane (1h 30 min).\nIntercalate the nanomembrane between the 40 mm and the 7 mm diameter brass electrodes (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nPut the whole on the cell holder (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nProgram the WinDETA to measure for 10 min at 60°C and from 60°C to −80°C (80 min).\nAnd from −80°C to 30°C (55 min).\nStart the dielectric measurement of the empty nanomembrane.\nControl of water sample (3h 30 min).\nStop the measurement using WinDETA.\nRemove top brass electrode (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B) and deposit a 200 μL drop of deionized water onto the nanomembrane (do not put back the top brass electrode).\nProgram WinDETA to increase temperature to 50°C (10 min) and keep at 50°C for 15 min. The bulk water evaporates and the sample enters the nanopores and to.\nCool down to 30°C (10 min), keep for 5 min.\nPut the top brass electrode on the nanomembrane for measurement.\nProgram WinDETA to increase temperature from 30°C to 60°C (15 min) and to.",
    "Start measuring the dielectric response of water for 10 min at 60°C and from 60°C to −80°C (80 min), and to.\nNote: The empty membrane and the water sample should exhibit a linear dielectric signal and no relaxation peaks (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, inset).\nControl of the protein state after thermal treatments and during the measurement (13h 30 min).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1842-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

The bulk water evaporates and the sample enters the nanopores, and to.\nCool down to 30°C (10 min), keep for 5 min.\nPut the top brass electrode on the nanomembrane for measurement.\nProgram WinDETA for the whole 48 h protein experiment (from 3.h. to 4.d.), and start the measurement.",
    "Cycle 1 (∼ 6 h): WinDETA is programmed to increase temperature from 30°C to 60°C (15 min), incubate for three hours at 60°C, cool down to −80°C (Cooling, C, 70 min), maintain at −80°C for 30 min and heat back to 60°C (Heating, H, 70 min). A cycle is composed of the three hours incubation time, the cooling (C) and the heating (H) temperature measurements, and to.\nCycle 2 (∼ 6 h): incubate again sample for three hours at 60°C, cool down to −80°C (Cooling, C, 70 min), maintain at −80°C for 30 min and heat back to 60°C (Heating, H, 70 min).\nCompare cycle 1 and cycle 2 dielectric signals (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) to determine if the incubation time is enough to reach a stable unfolded state troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]. Compare heating and cooling dielectric signals (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) to determine if there is some hysteresis suggesting unfolding/refolding during the measurement troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nCritical: The state of the protein sample must be stable during the measurement otherwise the dielectric signal cannot be unambiguously interpreted as dipole fluctuations and molecular dynamics of a given protein state because it can also result from changes in the dipole environments due to protein unfolding/refolding taking place during the measurement.\nPart 2: Thermal unfolding of CtxB\nTiming: 1 day",
    "The measurements at 60°C are protein controls but are also measurements of the early thermal unfolding stage of the protein (low temperature). The step 2 is the measurement of the dielectric signals of the protein for thermal treatments at higher temperatures and up to 180°C. WinDETA is programmed to run the whole experiment and measure the dielectric response for thermal treatments from 60°C to 180°C and at the seven frequencies (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) such that the measurement is not stopped between steps 1 and 2, it stops itself at the end of the program.\nDielectric signals of the protein sample after thermal treatments at temperatures above 60°C.\nTotal 380 min, 80°C: After cycle 2 at 60°C, WinDETA is programmed to continue measuring, increase temperature from 60°C to 80°C (10 min), incubate sample for three hours at 80°C, cool down to −80°C (Cooling, C, 80 min), maintain at −80°C for 30 min and heat back to 80°C (Heating, H, 80 min), and to.\nTotal 400 min, 100°C: Increase temperature from 80°C to 100°C (10 min), incubate sample for three hours at 100°C, cool down to −80°C (Cooling, C, 90 min), maintain at −80°C for 30 min and heat back to 100°C (Heating, H, 90 min), and to.\nTotal 450 min, 140°C: Increase temperature from 100°C to 140°C (20 min), incubate sample for three hours at 140°C, cool down to −80°C (Cooling, C, 110 min), maintain at −80°C for 30 min and heat back to 140°C (Heating, H, 110 min) and to.\nTotal 360 min, 180°C: Increase temperature from 140°C to 180°C (20 min), incubate sample for three hours at 180°C, cool down to −80°C (Cooling, C, 130 min), maintain at −80°C for 30 min.\nNote: As for the thermal treatment at 60°C, the cooling and heating dielectric signals should be similar.",
    "Data reproducibility.\nRepeat Major steps 1 and 2 for investigating experimental reproducibility. Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] shows two experiments comparing the results for two thermal treatments (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) and for three frequencies (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nCompare thermal treatments at one frequency (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A):\nThe dielectric signals are reasonably reproduced (similar dielectric loss intensity, peak position and peak number) with the peaks P1 overlapping across the two experiments and for both temperatures of the thermal treatments and the peaks P2 and P3 showing a shift of position of around 6°C and different dielectric loss intensities for P2.\nNote: P1 is likely to be associated with the least unfolded state as it has the lower temperature position meaning faster and smaller collective dipole fluctuations, hence less dipoles destabilized. This is also supported by the fact that P1 is detected from early (60°C thermal treatment) to late (180°C thermal treatment) stages of unfolding and is therefore the most stable state detected, hence likely to be the closest to the native state.\nNote: P2 and P3 are further unfolded states, which might explain lower reproducibility, as intermediate folding/assembly states are difficult to trap due to instability and a poor population.\nCompare frequency dependencies of one thermal treatment (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B):\nThe dielectric signals are reasonably reproduced (similar dielectric loss intensity, peak position and peak number) after the thermal treatments at 100°C. The peaks P1 are detected for frequencies from 1 Hz to 1 MHz while P2 is detected from 1 Hz to 1 KHz and P3 only at 1 KHz.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1842-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Reproducibility\n(A) The 1 Hz dielectric loss ε” is plotted against temperature (cooling) for two experiments and after thermal treatments at two different temperatures.",
    "(B) The dielectric loss ε” is plotted against temperature after the thermal treatment at 100°C and for three frequencies (1 Hz, 1 kHz and 1 MHz).\nPart 3: Data analysis and interpretation\nTiming: 1 week\nBackground.\nRational. A series of thermal treatments of three hours incubation at increasing temperatures from 60°C to 180°C triggers the thermal unfolding of CtxB5. Dielectric signal arises from dipole fluctuations, which depend on the local environment of the dipoles as well as on the morphological organization of matter. The dielectric signal monitors the protein thermal unfolding because when the protein unfolds with temperature, the local environment of the dipoles and the global conformation of the protein change as atomic interactions change.\nDielectric signals.\nThe linear response of the dielectric loss ε” with increasing temperature is the conductivity contribution of the sample while the non-linear (i.e., peaks) increase is due to molecular relaxations (Kremer and Schönhals, 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nThe relaxation peaks correspond to the molecular dynamics of B-subunits detectable in the temperature and frequency windows of the measurements.\nOne relaxation peak represents a set of dipoles collectively fluctuating; two relaxation peaks involve two different sets of dipoles.\nCritical: A relaxation peak is associated with a set of conformations and not a unique conformation so the peak features result from conformational averages. Now, for the sake of clarity, we refer to an unfolded state associated with a peak and not averaged unfolded states associated with a peak.\nPeak features.\nA peak position is characterized by the molecular dynamics of the set of dipoles contributing to the signal. The lower the temperature of the peak position the faster the dipoles fluctuate and the smaller the collective motions is (less dipoles fluctuating together).",
    "The intensity of a peak depends on multiple parameters (concentration of the conformations, contribution of the dipoles) so it cannot be interpreted.\nThe shape (broadness, symmetry) of the peak reveals the conformational heterogeneity.\nCritical: Cautious that the dielectric loss ε” monitors the molecular dynamics of conformational averages and hence do not provide direct structural information on conformations but a peak indicates the dynamics of a set of dipole that associates with a conformation (averaged conformations).\nProtein dynamics. According to the knowledge on protein dynamics, the frequencies from 1 Hz to 1 MHz correspond to slow collective motions (Henzler-Wildman and Kern, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Munoz and Cerminara, 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). From microsecond (1 MHz) to millisecond (1 kHz) there are motions of 2D- and 3D- structures. From millisecond to second, there are motions of large domain, interface and chain.\nNote: Side chain motions are faster and not detected in the frequency window of our experiments.\nNote: Functional slow dynamics is also not detected simply because the function of the protein is not triggered in our experiments. Slow and collective motions that take place during the thermal unfolding are monitored.\nPeak and unfolded state identification.\nExport the data from WinDETA to Excel (or else).\nSort the data in Excel by temperature of the thermal treatments and frequencies.\nPlot the dielectric loss ε” measured after each thermal treatment as a function of temperature and at a given frequency (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Here the cooling measurement is plotted at 1 Hz as an example.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1842-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Dielectric loss ε” temperature and frequency dependencies of CtxB5 upon thermal treatments\n(A) The 1 Hz dielectric loss ε” is plotted against temperature (cooling) after the thermal treatments at 60°C, 80°C, 100°C, 140°C and 180°C (Cycle 2).",
    "(B) The frequency dependencies of the dielectric loss ε” are plotted against temperature (cooling) after the thermal treatments at 60°C.\n(C) The frequency dependencies of the dielectric loss ε” are plotted against temperature (cooling) after the thermal treatments at 140°C. The inset is a close up to show the peaks P2 better. Same frequency-color legend as in 2B.\n(D) Electrostatic dipole network of CtxB5 (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). The nodes are charged amino acids linked when two opposite charges have atoms within 5 Å of one another. The colored links are based on the structural levels of the dipole: cyan for 1D link (left or right neighbors along the sequence), orange for 2D links (belong to the same secondary structure), green for 3D links and red for 4D links (between chains). The total number of electrostatic dipoles and the number in each respective structural level are indicated for one monomer.\nCount the number of peaks to determine the number of different CtxB unfolded states observed during the experiment. On Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, two peaks P1 and P2 are detected at 60°C while three peaks are detected at 140°C.\nDetermine the conformational heterogeneity of the peaks by comparing the peak broadness. P2 is broader than P1 and P3 suggesting a relaxation peak associated with larger conformational heterogeneities than the two others. This can suggest assembly intermediates (P2) versus unfolding intermediates (P1 and P3).\nCritical: This is assuming that in the assembly intermediates, the fluctuating dipoles have the same local environment but have different spatiotemporal dynamics when they are in dimers, trimers or tetramers, hence a response covering a larger range of temperature but still appearing under the same peak because same dipoles are contributing.\nThermal resistance of unfolded states.",
    "Characterize the thermal resistance of the unfolded states by looking over which thermal treatments the peaks remained detectable.\nExample 1: The peak P1 is detected over all thermal treatments from 60°C up to 180°C with a shift of the temperature peak position from −14°C to 10°C with the increase of the temperature of the thermal treatments.\nExample 2: The peak 2, P2 is detected after the thermal treatments from 60°C to 140°C with a shift of the temperature peak position from 30°C to 80°C with the increase of the temperature of the thermal treatments.\nExample 3: The peak 3, P3 is detected after the thermal treatments from 140°C to 180°C with a shift of the temperature peak position from 10°C to 60°C with the increase of the temperature of the thermal treatments.\nFrequency characteristics of the peaks and CtxB unfolded state dynamics.\nPlot the dielectric loss measured as a function of temperature but for different frequencies and for a given thermal treatment (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C).\nCount the number of peaks and determine their frequency range (i.e., the frequency at which a peak is observed).\nExamples: P1 is detected from 1 Hz to 105 Hz (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B) and from 1 Hz to 106 Hz (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C) so this unfolded state involves microsecond to second motions while P2 is detected from 1 Hz to 103 Hz (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C) and its unfolded state involves only motions between millisecond and second. P3 is detected from 1 Hz to 105 Hz and its unfolded state involves microsecond to second motions as P1.",
    "Note: According to protein dynamics (see background 6d), P1 and P3 would be unfolded states involving 2D, 3D and 4D structural motions while P2 will be involving only slower motions such as 4D chain motions, consistently with its larger broadness and the detection of assembly intermediates.\nDipole contribution to the dielectric signal (only if PDB of protein is available).\nUnder ionized buffer conditions, electrostatic dipoles are the main contributors to the dielectric signal and the contribution of non-ionized dipoles is negligible in comparison.\nIf proficient in protein structure program: determine electrostatic dipoles from the protein PDB using PDB viewer (or else).\nDownload PDB: 1EEI from https://www.rcsb.org/[href=https://www.rcsb.org/].\nSelect opposite charged residues within 5 Å of one another as electrostatic dipoles.\nDetermine the structural level of the electrostatic dipoles to infer the frequency range they are expected to contribute to the dielectric signals (see background 6d).\nIf proficient in python, determine electrostatic dipoles from the electrostatic network model (materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nDownload the code from GitHub (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) and run it on the PDB of the protein of interest (1EEI for CtxB5).\nDetermine the structural level of these electrostatic dipoles to infer the frequency range there are expected to contribute to the dielectric signals (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D).\nFor CtxB5 with PDB: 1EEI, the electrostatic model (or the structure analysis) reveals 5 electrostatic dipoles involved in 1D structure (first neighbors along the protein sequence), 11 in 2D structures, 7 in 3D-structures and 11 in 4D-structures per monomer. This is consistent with the relaxation peaks observed over the frequencies from 1 Hz to 1 MHz and the detection of slow collective motions of 2D, 3D and 4D structures."
