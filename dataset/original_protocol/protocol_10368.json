    "1. ICC Scaffold Fabrication (Figure 1)\nPrepare the polystyrene (PS) lattices (diameter = 6 mm; 8-13 layers of beads).\n\t\nTo prepare the mold, cut the tips off from 0.2 ml boil-proof microcentrifuge tubes at the 40 µl level. Adhere the top of the cut-tubes to 24 x 60 mm2 microscope cover glass slips with water-proof glue.\nPut the PS spheres (diameter = 140 µm) contained within a water suspension into a 20 ml vial, carefully pipette out the water suspension, and add 18 ml of 70% ethanol solution into the vial. Put the sphere solution into an ultrasonic bath to loosen aggregated spheres. Repeat this washing step several times in order to remove water and water-soluble components completely.\nPipette 100 µl of ethanol into the molds.\nCut the top of a 200 µl micropipette tip by 4 mm. Pipette 25 µl of the spheres into the mold twice using the 200 µl micropipette to achieve a total volume of 50 µl in each mold.\nPlace the molds on a rocking shaker at 120 rpm overnight.\nCheck the arrangement of the spheres in each mold under an optical microscope. If the spheres are not ordered hexagonally, add 50 µl of 70% ethanol and shake manually in the longitudinal and lateral axis direction to correct the arrangement.\nLet the ethanol evaporate at room temperature (RT) for two nights. Place the mold and bead complex in a 130 °C furnace for 6 hr to anneal the PS beads.\nPreparing bare and ECM-coated PEGDA scaffolds.\n\t\nSynthesize PEGDA macromers using established protocols45,46 for acrylating linear PEG macromers (Mw = 4.6 kDa).\nPrepare 50% (w/v) PEGDA solution in de-ionized (DI) water and allow the macromer to properly dissolve by centrifuging at 4,713 x g until it is completely dissolved.",
    "For ECM conjugated ICC scaffolds, dissolve an additional 10% (w/v) Acryloyl-PEG-NHS (Mw=3.4 kDa) in the 50% PEGDA solution.\nPrepare a 20% (w/v) stock solution of 2-hydroxy-4'-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone (PI) in 70% ethanol.\nAdd 50 µl of 20% (w/v) PI stock solution per 1 ml of 50 % (w/v) of PEGDA. Adjust the needed amount of PI stock solution based on the molecular weight of PEGDA.\nVortex the mixture in centrifuge tube for 1 min to reach a homogenous solution.\nPeel the molds from the glass slide (from step 1.1.7), remove the glue from the molds, push the lattices out carefully using a spatula and place each of them into a 1.5 ml tube. Pipette 300 µl of the PEGDA solution and centrifuge at 845 x g for 5 min to allow proper PEGDA solution infiltration into the lattice.\nRemove the lattice from the tube using tweezers and carefully blot dry excess PEGDA solution on gloves. Place the lattice on a paraffin film-covered glass with the flat circular surface facing up.\nExpose the PEGDA solution infiltrated scaffold to 365 nm ultraviolet (UV) light (10.84 mW/cm2) for 5 min using a UV spot lamp.\nPlace PEGDA-polymerized crystal lattices in new vials (around 10 lattices per vial) and add 20 ml of tetrahydrofuran (THF). Shake the vials on an orbital shaker at 300 rpm. Change THF at least 3 times with an interval of 1-2 hr.\n\t\tNote: Do not remove THF completely when changing the THF in order to prevent bubbles from entering the scaffolds, which in turn can cause incomplete removal of PS. Leave enough solution to cover the lattices and add new THF.\n\t\tCaution: THF is toxic. Wear gloves, a lab coat and goggles. Avoid inhalation by operating under the fume hood.",
    "Check if PS spheres are dissolved by putting water into the used THF solution and observing the solution color. Repeat step 1.2.9 if the PS spheres are not properly dissolved.\n\t\tNote: The solution color will change to white if there are any remaining PS spheres.\nClean the scaffolds in the biosafety cabinet (BSC).\n\t\nTo sterilize the scaffolds, prepare a 50 ml centrifuge tube with 2 ml of 70% ethanol per scaffold and place the scaffolds in the tube using a spatula. Allow the scaffolds to soak in ethanol for 1 hr. From this step forward, conduct all the procedures in the BSC.\nCarefully pour the ethanol out and replace with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (2 ml per scaffold) and centrifuge at 524 x g for 3 min to remove bubbles. Keep it in the refrigerator and change the PBS a few times with an interval of 1-2 hr.\n\t\t\nFor Collagen type I-coated scaffolds, prepare another 50 ml centrifuge tube containing Collagen type 1 stock solution (1 ml per scaffold), transfer the sterilized scaffolds to this tube using a spatula, and centrifuge at 524 x g for 3 min. Shake the scaffolds at 400 rpm on an orbital shaker for 30 min and keep the tube in the refrigerator overnight.\nWash the scaffolds with PBS twice before use by submerging the scaffolds in fresh PBS and then aspirating the PBS.\n\t\t\tNote: Other ECM proteins can also be used instead of Collagen type I because the NHS chemistry requires an amine group to form the bond (Figure 2).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54331/54331fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Overview of ICC fabrication. PEG-based ICC scaffolds are fabricated using microfabrication techniques with and without ECM-functionalization. ECM-coated ICC scaffolds require PEG-NHS as well as PEGDA (as detailed in Figure 2). The PS lattice has a diameter of 6 mm and a height of 8-13 bead layers.

ICC Structure Characterization\nTo analyze ICC structure with or without conjugated proteins, use scanning electron microscopy (SEM)47.\n\t\nFix the scaffolds with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), serially dehydrate them in 25, 50, 75, 95 and 100% ethanol solutions, and store them at -80 °C until the ethanol evaporates completely.\nDry samples in a freeze drier for 48 hr.\nAffix the sample onto sample holder using carbon tape and place in a sputter coater.\nAfter automatic vacuuming, coat it with a Pt film of 10 nm thickness by sputtering for 60 sec at 20 mA.\nImage ICC scaffolds using SEM at a voltage of 5 kV (Figure 3A, Figure 4A).\nTo measure the pore and interconnection diameter of cavities, analyze SEM micrographs using image analysis software48 (e.g., ImageJ; Figure 3B,C).\nTo visualize the conjugated collagen to the scaffold without cells, fluorescently tag the collagen using antibodies (1:100) against the collagen type I and image with confocal laser scanning microscopy47 (CLSM; Figure 4B).\n3. Huh-7.5 Cell Culture and Seeding",
    "Culture Huh-7.5 cells at a seeding density of 2-2.5 x 106 cells/ml in 100 mm cell culture dishes with 10 ml Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin (growth media) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Change the media every three days in the BSC until they have reached 75-80% confluency.\nPrepare the scaffolds for cell seeding in the BSC.\n\t\nCarefully place the scaffolds in a 24-well plate with the flat surface facing up.\nTo wash the scaffold, pipette 2 ml PBS to each well containing a scaffold. Aspirate the PBS and pipette 2 ml fresh PBS into each well.\nAspirate the PBS and pipette 2 ml of growth media (see step 3.1) and leave for 30 min. Aspirate the media and allow the scaffold to dry for 1 hr.\nDetach confluent Huh-7.5 cells (from step 3.1) from the culture plate in the BSC using the trypsin digestion method.\n\t\nAspirate media from plate, add 4 ml PBS to wash adherent cells and then aspirate PBS.\nPipette 0.75-1 ml 0.25% trypsin and place in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 3 min.\nRemove plate from incubator and pipette 5 ml media to stop the trypsin reaction. Pipette media, detached cells, and trypsin mixture into a 15 ml tube.\nCentrifuge at 524 x g for 3 min, remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 5 ml media.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer and calculate the volume of the cell suspension that contains cells at target number, N0, per 25 µl (for standard experiment, N0 is 1 x 106 cells).\n\tVolume of cell suspension=(target number of cells)/(concentration of cell suspension)",
    "Slowly pipette 25 µl of cell suspension (containing N0 cells) directly on top of each scaffold (from step 3.1.4). Place the 24-well plate in the incubator.\nAfter 12 hr, transfer the scaffolds carefully with the use of a spatula into a new 24-well plate and pipette 2 ml of media into each well. Place the 24-well plate in the incubator.\nChange the media every 3 days or depending on when media is collected for protein secretion analysis (see Step 5.1).\n4. Cell Viability\nTo qualitatively analyze cell viability, use fluorescent live/dead staining kits to stain the cells and image using CLSM.\n\t\nFollowing kit instruction, prepare a solution with 4 µM calcein AM and 8 µM ethidium homo-dimer-1 in media (see step 3.1.3).\n\t\tNote: Optimize depending on the cell number. Use double the amount of reagent if cells proliferate and double in number (around 2 million).\nIn the BSC, aspirate media in each well with a scaffold (step 3.7) and pipette 500 µl of the prepared solution. Incubate samples in a 37 °C incubator for 1 hr.\nCover the plates in foil to protect the samples from light when removing the plate out of the incubator. Image samples using CLSM49.\nTo quantitatively assess cell viability, measure enzymatic activity (in live cells) using colorimetric assays50 (i.e., 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (monosodium-salt reagent)).\n\t\nCreate a standard curve for the ICC platform (i.e., a graph of absorbance (OD) versus given cell number).\n\t\tNote: Cell seeding is not 100% efficient in comparison to other platforms, since cells can pass through the cavities of scaffolds.\n\t\t\nDetermine the cell seeding numbers, N0 that will be used to make the standard curve.",
    "Note: Choose a range that includes cell numbers that are estimated in the experiment. For example, if the initial cell number is 5 x 105 cells and there is an estimated ~3 fold increase by the last day of the experiment, choose 2.5 x 105, 5 x 105, 1 x 106, and 2 x 106 cells as N0.\nPerform cell seeding in the ICC scaffolds (one N0 per scaffold with seeding volume of 25 µl) as described in steps 3.1-3.6.\nAfter 6 hr, transfer the scaffolds to another 24-well plate well. Select a time that allows cell adherence but not cell proliferation.\nPerform cell counting on the transferred ICC scaffold.\n\t\t\t\nDilute 10x monosodium-salt reagent (MSR) solution to 1x with media in the BSC and pipette 500 µl 1x MSR solution into each well with a scaffold. Incubate the 24-well plate at 37 °C for 1 hr.\nFrom each well, transfer 100 µl into a 96-well plate well. As a blank, pipette 100 µl of fresh 1x monosodium-salt reagent solution into different wells on the 96-well plate. Manually remove any bubbles present using a dry pipette tip and cover the 96-well plate in foil to protect it from light.\nMeasure OD at λ = 450 nm reading using a spectrophotometer. Subtract the blank OD from other values to find the accurate OD51.\nCount the number of cells (NL) remaining in the well after transferring the scaffold (step 4.2.1.3) using a hemocytometer.\n\t\t\tNote: Use 300 µl of trypsin to trypsinize the cells.\nCalculate the actual cell number, NA.\n\t\t\tactual = initial - left in well\n\t\t\tNA=N0-NL\nMake standard curve by plotting OD obtained in Step 4.2.1.4.3 vs. actual cell number (NA) and use this to estimate the cell number in the experiments.",
    "Note: Make a new standard curve if any ICC parameters (i.e., porogen size, dimensions of the scaffold, ECM protein, etc.) are changed.\n5. Cell Function\nAnalyze protein secretion by the Huh-7.5 cells (i.e., albumin, urea) from the collected media (from step 3.7) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)52.\n\tNote: Dilute the media, depending on the number of cells seeded and the amount of media collected. For 5 x 105 cells seeded in ICC, use a ~1:25 ratio, before introducing it to the antibody-precoated wells.\nTo qualitatively analyze cell function, immunostain specific intracellular proteins (i.e., albumin), enzymes (i.e., CYP450), stain structural components (i.e., cellular actin) as well as the nuclei and image using CLSM49.\n\t\nAspirate media (from step 3.7) and pipette 2 ml PBS to wash the cell-laden ICC scaffolds.\nPipette 1 ml of 4% PFA and incubate for 5 min at room temperature for fixation.\nWash 3x with 2 ml PBS.\nPermeabilize membranes by incubating the scaffolds in 1 ml of 0.1% 4-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)phenyl-polyethylene glycol (surfactant) for 30 min.\nWash 3x with 2 ml PBS to remove any leaking proteins.\nPipette 500 µl 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and incubate at RT for 1 hr to block non-specific binding.\nPrepare diluted primary antibody (i.e., albumin, CYP450) solution.\n\t\t\nPipette 500 µl of 1% BSA solution into a 15 ml tube and add 4.5 ml of 0.1% surfactant solution to prepare a total 5 ml of 0.1% BSA solution.\nPipette 98 µl of the 0.1% BSA solution into a 200 µl microcentrifuge tube and 2 µl of the primary antibody to produce a 1:50 (primary antibody: 0.1% BSA) primary antibody solution.",
    "Pipette 40 µl of the primary antibody solution on the scaffold and cover the substrate with paraffin film. Wrap the 24 well plate with aluminum foil and store the dish at 4 °C overnight.\nWash 3x with 2 ml PBS and shake the plate gently in between washing.\nPrepare diluted biotinylated secondary antibody (i.e., Anti-mouse antibody) stock solution.\n\t\t\nPipette 198 µl 0.1% BSA solution and 2 µl second antibody to produce a 1:100 (secondary antibody: 0.1% BSA) secondary antibody solution.\nPrepare a 0.1% stock solution of rhodamine or fluorescein labeled phalloidin (to stain the cellular actin filaments) in the 0.1% BSA solution.\nPipette 25 µl of each solution in a tube and mix well.\nPipette 50 µl of the secondary antibody stock solution on the scaffold. Cover the scaffold with paraffin film, wrap the dish with aluminum foil and store at RT for 2 hr.\nWash 3x with 2 ml PBS.\nPipette 200 µl of 0.2% 4'-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; a nucleus stain) solution on the scaffold and keep at RT for 2-3 min. Cover the plate with aluminum foil.\nWash 2x with 2 ml PBS.\nUsing a dropper, place a drop of mounting media on the substrate.\nCarefully put the scaffold on a glass slide and image using CLSM47.\nAssess the gene expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Use standard kits for reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)53 and qPCR54 as per manufacturer's instructions. Extract the RNA from the cells as described below.\n\t\nPlace the scaffold (from step 3.7) in a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube.\nPipette 1 ml of an RNA extraction solution into the tube and keep in a sonicator for 5 min at RT.",
    "Pipette 200 µl of chloroform into each microcentrifuge tube and shake the tube vigorously in hand for 15-20 sec. Keep the tubes at RT for ~3 min until the phases separate.\nCentrifuge the sample at 13,000 x g, 4 °C for 15 min and remove the tubes carefully so that phases do not mix.\nCarefully pipette 500-600 µl of the upper aqueous phase from the first tube into a second microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd an equivalent volume (500-600 µl) of isopropanol to this second tube.\nInvert the tube 3-5 times and leave the tube standing at RT for 10 min.\nCentrifuge the sample at 13,000 x g, 4 °C for 15 min.\n\t\t\nIf a pellet is not visible at the bottom of the tube, centrifuge again for 5 min.\n\t\t\tNote: If there is still no visible pellet, the amount of RNA may be insufficient.\nInvert tubes with the cap open to discard supernatant and pipette in 1 ml 70% ethanol diluted in DEPC water into the tube.\nSlightly vortex the tube so the pellet detaches from the wall of the tube and then let the tube air dry.\nAdd 50 µl of DPEC water to resuspend the pellet.\nKeep pipetting until the pellet dissolves.\nKeep for 10 min at 55 °C in order to denature the double-stranded RNA into single-stranded RNA.\nLightly drum fingers on the tube bottom and then centrifuge the tubes briefly (7,500 x g, 4 min, 4 °C).\nKeep the tubes in ice until performing reverse transcriptase55 and real-time PCR as described in 56.\nSubscription Required.
