    "Note: All animal procedures and animal care methods should be approved by the institution’s Institutional Animal Care and Usage Committee (IACUC). Study described here was performed in accordance to the guidelines established by SRI International’s IACUC. \n1. Acquisition and maintenance of LOX-deficient mice\nPurchase 5-LOX-deficient or 12/15-LOX-deficient mice and respective strain and sex-matched controls at age 7-8 weeks and allow several days for acclimation to facility after arrival.\nMaintain mice in group housing on a 12-h light-dark cycle and give food and drinking water ad libitum.\n2. MPTP precautions, storage, preparation, decontamination and disposal\nNote: MPTP intoxication from intravenous exposure in humans has been shown to cause parkinsonism10; MPTP is highly lipophilic and can readily cross the blood-brain barrier26. Precautionary measures should be taken to ensure safe handling, detoxification and disposal. Its metabolism involves multiple steps including conversion to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyridinium by the enzyme monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B)27. MAO-B inhibitors may be utilized in case of accidental human intoxication.\nEnsure that personnel have appropriate safety and handling training before utilizing MPTP as dictated by the institution’s Health and Safety Committee. Each institution may establish and implement its own standard operating procedures for use of MPTP, based on recommendations comprehensively outlined in the literature17,22.\nPrior to preparation, don appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) including the following: disposable lab coat or full body suit, double nitrile gloves, surgical mask, hair cover, safety goggles, and disposable shoe covers. Proper PPE should be worn during preparation of MPTP, the injection paradigm and 72 h post-injection when handling animals and/or bedding.\nPerform calculations prior to preparation. Institutional guidelines for dosing volumes should be followed; delivery of 100-150 µl is typically used for 25-30 g mice.",
    "To prepare a 3 mg/ml MPTP solution in saline, apply a correction factor (1.211 MPTP-HCl: 1.0 MPTP free base); the concentration of MPTP-HCl in saline vehicle is 3.633 mg/ml.  \nPrepare all equipment, supplies and reagents needed for MPTP preparation and potential spill decontamination prior to handling the neurotoxin.\nRemove MPTP-HCl source vial from proper storage location.\n\tNote: MPTP should be maintained at RT in a closed vial within a secondary container, and stored within a locked cabinet, labeled “MPTP.”\n\t\nCover area surrounding scales with pads or paper towels dampened with 10% bleach solution to reduce the risk from spilled powder. Keep tissues and 10% bleach solution nearby as a precaution.\nUsing an analytical balance located in a fume hood, weigh 50 mg of MPTP-HCl into glass vial with secondary containment containing 10% bleach-soaked tissue. Label the glass vial “MPTP” with concentration and date.\nClose source vial and wipe the outside with 10% bleach.\nSlowly add 13.763-ml sterile saline to vial and close completely for mixing. (Solution is 3.633mg/ml MPTP-HCl.)\n\t\nIn the hood, carefully sterilize MPTP solution by filtration using a 0.22 µm filter into labeled injection vial within a secondary container with 10% bleach-soaked tissue. Clean any spill with bleach-soaked tissue.\nCarefully dispose of sharps and vial in appropriately labeled biohazard container. Maintain MPTP solution in vial in the secondary container with bleach-soaked tissue for transport to animal procedure room.\n\t\tNote: do not autoclave MPTP solution for sterilization as its vaporization is an inhalation hazard.\nReturn MPTP source vial to its secondary container and place in storage location. Decontaminate spatula, analytical scale and hood surface for 10 min using 10% bleach.\n3. MPTP administration",
    "Prepare disposable cages with standard microisolator perforated lids containing polyester filtered liners marked “MPTP” (minus wire food grill), disposable cage liners, pre-wet food pellets and hydrogel as water source. Weigh all animals and record volume of 3 mg/ml MPTP in saline required for 15 mg/kg injection.\n\tNote: MPTP metabolites are detectable in excreta for 3 days following injection28,29; however, mice excrete MPTP n-oxide, a non-toxic derivative that does not cross membranes because of its hydrophilicity30.\n\t\nWearing all PPE listed above and holding mice over a disposable absorption pad, inject saline vehicle or MPTP solution for 15 mg/kg dose into the intraperitoneal cavity (i.p.), daily for 4 days with a disposable 26-gauge tuberculin syringe.\nDo not recap syringe after use; dispose into a dedicated and labeled MPTP biohazardous sharps container. Maintain 10% bleach and tissues nearby to clean any accidental drips.\nPlace animals injected with MPTP in disposable cages, up to 5 mice per cage, and house on open racks. Do not use ventilated racks.\n\t\nPlace MPTP use placards on rack containing mice and housing room door until 72 h after last injection.\n\t\tNote: ensure temperature of housing room is between 22.2 - 24.4oC, as mice experience transient hypothermia up to 12h following MPTP intoxication.31\nDecontaminate work surface with bleach after each use (see step 2.8), dispose of leftover MPTP solution by addition of a volume equivalent of 10% bleach, and discard contents as biohazardous liquid waste.\nDiscard all used PPE in dedicated disposal bin. If needed, spray with 10% bleach before disposal.",
    "Check animals regularly and refresh food and water source daily during injection paradigm and 72 h after the last injection. Note: although no contamination is anticipated in the area immediately surrounding the outside of the cage, this region is treated with the bleach solution as a precaution (as described in Step 2.8).Care should be taken when handling all mice and equipment during this period.\n\t\nThree days after the last injection, dispose of all cages and liners in appropriately labeled biohazard bag. Resume use of regular PPE and normal housing for animals; remove door and shelf placards.\n4. Tissue harvesting \nEuthanize animals by cervical dislocation 7 days following the last MPTP injection. Immediately dissect brain on ice using pre-chilled brain mold with 1-mm slots in the coronal plane.\nDissect the striatum from a forebrain slice 2-mm thick at the level of the anterior commissure.\n\t\nRemove surrounding cortical and subcortical regions using a scalpel. Snap-freeze striatal tissue from each hemisphere in a separate 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube for neurochemical or biochemical analysis.\nBlock midbrain/hindbrain in the coronal plane at the level of anterior hypothalamus and immersion-fix tissue in 4% formaldehyde aqueous solution.\n5. Tissue processing\nProcess for biochemistry\n\t\nHomogenize striatal tissue from one hemisphere using an ultrasonic cell disruptor in 200-µL Tris-EDTA lysis buffer (25mM Tris base, 1mM EDTA, 1:100 protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails) for 10 pulses at 10-12 Hz and centrifuged for 10 min at 4oC at 1000xg.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant, and reconstitute the pellet in 150-µl lysis buffer. Fractions are used for biochemical analysis by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.\n\t\tNote: use protease and phosphatase inhibitor-containing buffer within 1 h of preparation due to instability in aqueous solutions.\nProcess for neurochemistry",
    "Utilize striatum dissected from other hemisphere from each sample stored at -80°C for HPLC. Thaw striatal tissues in microfuge tubes on ice, add 500-μl 0.3N perchloric acid (PCA) and homogenize using sonicator.\n\t\tNote: To make 100 ml of 0.3N PCA, measure 90-ml ddH2O, add to a 100-ml graduated cylinder, add 2.58 ml of 70% PCA, and bring to 100-ml mark. This sample buffer can be stored at 4°C for up to one month.\nSonicate striatal tissue in 500-µl ice-cold 0.3N PCA, for 10 pulses at 10-12 Hz and place on ice. To ensure homogeneity, sonicate samples a second time for 10 sec, then centrifuge for 12 min at 4oC at 16,100xg. \nImmediately decant supernatant to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and store at -80°C. Air-dry the pellet fraction in hood.\nMaintain the supernatant at -80°C until use for measurement of dopamine and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) by HPLC with electrochemical detection.\nOnce dry, reconstitute the pellet fraction in 0.5N NaOH (500 µL), and briefly sonicate. Store reconstituted pellet fraction at 4°C until use for determination of total protein using the Lowry method.\nProcess for immunohistochemistry\n\t\nImmersion-fix mid- and hind-brain blocks overnight in 4% formaldehyde aqueous solution and cryoprotect in graded sucrose solutions (10% in phosphate-buffered saline (0.01 M PBS; 0.138 M NaCl, 0.0027 M KCl, and ddH2O, pH 7.4) for 24 h, then 30% in PBS until until the tissue sinks) at 4°C. Briefly blot cryoprotected blocks to remove excess sucrose solution, freeze on dry ice and store at -80°C until use.\nMicrotome sectioning of brain blocks containing mid- and hind-brain in a cryostat.\n\t\t\nRemove tissues from -80°C, equilibrate at -16°C for 1 h in cryostat, and mount in tissue embedding media.",
    "Collect coronal sections at 40-µm thickness into cryoprotectant solution (0.01M PBS with 30% sucrose, 30% ethylene glycol, pH 7.4) at -16°C. Collect tissue serially into 6 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes at 240-um intervals and store at -20°C. \n6. Immunoblotting\nDetermine protein concentration in striatal supernatant fraction (prepared as described in Section 5.1) by BCA assay.\nCalculate dilution required for each sample to yield 10 µg per well delivered in 20 µl of volume.\nDilute supernatant protein with 4X Laemmli buffer and homogenization buffer to yield 10 µg protein in 1X Laemmli buffer solution. Example calculation:\n\t\nDetermine final concentration of protein and volume required. In this case, 10 µg in 20 µl (0.5 mg/ml) is required.\nDetermine the final volume of the protein solution needed. Although 20 µl is required for loading, extra volume should be prepared (30 µl).\nSince the final volume and concentration are known, and the concentration of the protein supernatant fraction is known (determined by the BCA assay), calculate the volume of the protein supernatant required using the equation:\n\t\tVsupernatant = (Vfinal x Cfinal)/C supernatant\n\t\tThus, for a supernatant protein concentration of 1.5 mg/ml,\n\t\tVsupernatant = (30 µl x 0.5 mg/ml)/1.5 mg/ml\n\t\tVsupernatant = 10 µl\nCalculate amount of 4X Laemmli buffer required to yield a 1x concentration in 30 µl of volume (30 µl / 4 = 7.5 µl). Note: 4X Laemmli buffer must be diluted to 1X strength in the sample preparation.\nCalculate amount of homogenization buffer required to bring volume to 30 µl (and obtain desired final protein concentration of 0.5 mg/ml):\nPrepare sample by vortexing then pipetting 10 µl of protein supernatant into 12.5 µl of homogenization buffer. Add 7.5 µl of 4X Laemmli buffer for a 30-µl sample working solution and 0.5 mg/ml concentration.",
    "Prepare all samples using procedure described, vortex and boil for 5 min.\n\tNote: Use screw-top microcentrifuge tubes to prevent leakage and opening due to pressure during boiling.\nAfter 5 min, immediately place on ice. Load 20 µl of sample working solution per gel well (10 µg of protein). Separate protein samples by SDS-PAGE on a 12% Tris-glycine gel.\n\t\nUse a pre-stained protein ladder for confirmation of molecular weights. Running buffer is 25 mM Tris-base, 192 mM glycine, 0.1% SDS, and ddH2O, pH 8.3.\nSeparate proteins by electrophoresis: run at 80 V to clear the wells (10 min) and 125 V (approximately 1 h; until protein ladder has fully separated) to resolve the proteins.\nPerform protein-to-nitrocellulose transfer using 0.2 µm nitrocellulose membrane in Tris-glycine transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine, 0.04% SDS, 20% methanol and ddH2O, pH 8.3) overnight for 40 V at 4°C.\nWash nitrocellulose blots in 1x Tris saline (TS; 25mM Tris, 0.9% NaCl in ddH2O, pH 7.4) for 10 min at RT. lncubate in Ponceau S for 5 min then rinse in ddH2O to provide a rough verification of equivalent protein loading. Scan image to retain record for notebook and destain using PBS.\n\tNote: Alternatively, wash blot in Milli-Q or ddH2O containing HCl (0.2%) for approximately 5 min. Scan for record. Remove Ponceau S stain from membrane by subsequent incubation step (i.e. place in the blocking buffer).\nBlock blots in 5% non-fat milk powder in TS for 1 h at RT and incubate 24h at 4ºC with rabbit anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (1:1000), anti-β-actin (1:200); anti-GFAP (1:1000) in 5% milk-TS.",
    "Wash blots 3 x 5 min in TS with 0.05% Tween-20 and 1 x 5 min in TS, then incubate in HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5000 in TS containing 5% milk), matched to the species of the primary, for 2 h at RT.\nPrepare chemiluminescent substrate using equal volumes of luminol and peroxide solutions and apply for 1-3 min. In a darkroom, place blot in a plastic sleeve for film exposure and expose to film; film is then developed using an automatic processor.\nStrip blots with commercially available stripping buffer at 37°C for 30 min, wash 3x 10 min in TS with 0.05% Tween-20, and 1x 10 min in TS and then reprobe for loading control or other protein of interest.\nQuantify the signals by Image J software for optical density measurements and normalize to the internal loading control β–actin.\n7. Neurochemistry\nTissue for analysis is prepared as described above in Section 5.2. Please refer to Table 1 for mobile phase recipe.\n\tNote: All reagents must be ≥99.0% pure and of HPLC grade. Ensure buffer integrity with clean, dedicated glassware and stir bars. Mobile phase buffer should be utilized within seven days of preparation.\n\t\nWeigh the dihydrogen phosphate and citric acid, add 1 L of ddH2O and mix in a 2-L graduated cylinder. Filter the solution through a 0.22-µm GSTF membrane.\n\t\tNote: This maximizes the extraction of contaminants in the phosphate and citric acid, which helps to minimize background currents.\nAdd the OSA followed by the acetonitrile and EDTA solution. Add HPLC grade ddH2O to approximately 1900 ml prior to adjusting the pH to 3.0 with phosphoric acid.",
    "Add HPLC grade ddH2O to the 2-L mark, and then pour into a 2-L flask. Add a dedicated stir bar, and degas the mobile phase by stirring it under vacuum for > 10 min.\nPrepare the standards for dopamine, and DOPAC and HVA for standard curves. Stock solutions of standards are prepared at 1 mg/ml in 0.3 N PCA.\n\t\nWeigh 12.4 mg of dopamine-HCl, and add 10.0 ml of 0.3 N PCA to make 1 mg/ml dopamine.\nWeigh 10.0 mg of DOPAC, and add 10.0 ml of 0.3 N PCA to make 1 mg/ml DOPAC.\nWeigh 10.0 mg HVA, and add 10.0 ml of 0.3 N PCA to make 1 mg/ml HVA.\nPrepare working standard solutions from the stock solutions. Five-point standards are used to generate a concentration curve.\n\t\nFor measurement of striatal dopamine, prepare standard concentrations of 12.5 ng/ml, 25 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml, and 200 ng/ml.\nFor striatal DOPAC, prepare standard concentrations of 2.5 ng/ml, 5 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 20 ng/ml, and 40 ng/ml.\nFor striatal HVA, prepare standard concentrations of 5 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 20 ng/ml, 40 ng/ml, and 80 ng/ml.\nGenerate five-point standards: dilute 1 mg/ml dopamine stock solution to 5 µg/ml using 0.3N PCA. Dilute 1 mg/ml DOPAC stock solution to 1 µg/ml using 0.3N PCA, and dilute 1 mg/ml HVA stock solution to 2 µg/ml using 0.3N PCA.\nTransfer 1 ml of 5 µg/ml dopamine, 1 ml of 1 µg/ml DOPAC, and 1 ml of 2 µg/ml HVA into a 25-ml volumetric flask and bring volume to 25 ml mark with 0.3 N PCA.\n\t\tNote: The mixed standards in the volumetric flask contain the highest concentration of the five-point standards: 200 ng/ml of dopamine, 40 ng/ml of DOPAC, and 80 ng/ml of HVA.",
    "Transfer 1 ml of the mixed standards into clean 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Perform 1:1 serial dilution four times to generate the subsequent four-point standards.\n\t\t\nFor example, to 250 μl of the mixed standards, add 250 μl of sample buffer and vortex thoroughly to produce mixed standards at 50% of original concentrations; repeat process until desired dilutions are achieved.\nPrepare the HPLC system (pump, autosampler, reverse-phase column (C18, 150×3.2 mm, 3 µm)). Purge the pump with fresh mobile phase to replace all previous solution in the HPLC system and trapped air bubbles with fresh mobile phase. Chill the autosampler to 4°C. Warm the column to 35°C, which reduces the total pressure.\n\t\nSet the voltage at -150 mV and 220 mV for the first and second electrodes of the electrochemical detector, respectively. Equilibrate the system for at least 2 h, and ideally overnight, with the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min.\n\t\tNote: During equilibration the cells should be on, and the baseline reading monitored. Stable reading indicates that the system is ready to use. For the two hours of the equilibration phase, allow the mobile phase to go into a waste container instead of recirculating it. After this period, the mobile phase can be recycled overnight for equilibration.\nOnce equilibration is complete, adjust the mobile phase flow rate to 0.6 ml/min. Inject 20 µl of each of the five-point standards.\nThaw striatal samples on ice, and inject 2 x 20 µl of each sample into the HPLC system. Utilize standards at the beginning and randomly throughout each set of striatal samples.",
    "Use the software to analyze the area under dopamine, DOPAC, and HVA peaks produced by the standards and samples. Identify analytes by retention time and measure by comparing the area under peak to that of 5-point curve for its corresponding standard.\nPrepare pellet fraction as described in Section 5.2.3. Perform a Lowry protein assay on the striatal pellet. Note: This assay will measure the amount of protein present in the striatal samples in mg/ml; this information is used to determine the ng/mg concentration of analyte.\n8. Immunohistochemistry\nGFAP/TH dual immunofluorescence\n\t\nRemove tubes containing sectioned midbrain from -20°C freezer and bring to RT. Remove tissue sections containing substantia nigra from cryopreservative solution in a tray containing PBS.\nPlace tissue sections in polystyrene inserts with polyester mesh bottoms for free-floating immunochemistry. Wash 3 x 5 min in PBS.\nTransfer sections to 96-well plate with 180-µl block solution (5% normal donkey serum, 1% PVP, 1% BSA and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) in each well. Incubate 40 min at RT.\n\t\tNote: All wash and incubation steps are performed with light agitation on shaker.\nTransfer sections to wells containing the primary antibody solution (180 µl per well). Incubate in primary antibody cocktail, rabbit anti-GFAP (1:1000) and sheep anti-TH (1:400) diluted in PBS with 1% BSA and 0.3% TX-100, for 24 h at 4°C. IgG from the primary species serves as the negative immunostaining control.\nIncubate in secondary antibody cocktail (1:200 donkey anti-rabbit 568 and 1:200 FITC donkey anti-sheep in PBS with 0.1% TX-100). Use foil to protect solution from light during preparation and incubation; incubate at RT for 2 h.\n\t\t\nFor a negative control, incubate sections in IgG from the primary species diluted to the same concentration as used for the primary antibodies.",
    "Wash 2 x PBS and 1 x TS for 5 min each at RT. Mount tissue sections on plus slides in mounting medium with Hoechst stain and coverslip.\nIncubate in secondary antibody cocktail (1:200 donkey anti-rabbit 568 and 1:200 FITC donkey anti-sheep in PBS with 0.1% TX-100). Use foil to protect solution from light during preparation and incubation; incubate at RT for 2 h.\nWash 2 x PBS and 1 x TS for 5 min each at RT. Mount tissue sections on plus slides in mounting medium with Hoechst stain and coverslip.\nProtect slides from light and oxidation until imaging by storing in a slide box at 4°C.\nAnalyze the negative control first to determine the background level of fluorescence, then evaluate for positive immunoreactivity using fluorescent microscopy.\nIba1 immunohistochemistry with chromagen precipitation\n\t\nRemove tubes containing sectioned midbrain from -20°C freezer and bring to RT. Remove tissue sections containing substantia nigra from cryopreservative solution in a tray containing PBS.\nPlace tissue sections in polystyrene inserts for free-floating immunochemistry. Wash sections 3 x 5 min in PBS, and place sections directly into 12-well plate containing pre-heated 10 mM citric acid monohydrate, pH 9.0, 80°C for 30 min, for epitope retrieval.\nCool plate 20 min at RT. Return sections to inserts and wash 3 x 5 min in PBS.\nTransfer sections to 96-well plate containing 180-µl blocking solution (10% normal goat serum, 1% BSA in PBS) per well, and incubate 40 min at RT.\nTransfer sections to wells containing 180-µl diluted primary antibody (1:1000 in 1% BSA-PBS). Incubate overnight at 4°C.\nTransfer sections to inserts. Wash 3 x 5 min PBS and apply biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200 in 1.5% normal serum-PBS) for 1 h at RT.",
    "Prepare ABC solution 30 min before use. Wash 3 x 5 min PBS and transfer to ABC solution for 1 h at RT.\nPrepare DAB solution in hood. Wash 2x 5 min in PBS and 1x 5 min in TS, and incubate sections in DAB.\n\t\t\nDevelop for 3-4 min. Negative control should remain light in color.\n\t\t\tNote: perform this step in fume hood as DAB is a known carcinogen. A solution of 0.2M potassium permanganate in ddH2O for decontamination should be maintained in proximity in case of accidental drips.\nRinse sections briefly in ddH2O, then in TS 3 x 5 min. Mount sections on plus slides and air-dry overnight in fume hood.\nDecontaminate DAB waste with an equal volume of 0.2M potassium permanganate in ddH2O, vortex, and incubate in a fume hood overnight before storing in appropriately labeled DAB waste bin in fume hood.\n\t\tNote: Bleach solution does not eliminate the mutagenic properties of DAB.\n\t\t\nDecontaminate items to be reused (i.e. polystyrene inserts) and wash with detergent.\nDehydrate/counterstain lightly with Cresyl violet (CV). All dehydration/wash steps are 3 min: ethanol 70%, 95%, 100%, 95%, ddH2O, CV (30 seconds), ddH20 x 2, 95% ethanol + glacial acetic acid (0.1%) x 2, 100% ethanol, and xylene.\nCoverslip in distyrene-toluene-xylene mounting medium and dry in fume hood.\nObserve positive immunoreactivity by a light microscope. IgG from the primary species serves as the negative immunostaining control.\n9. Statistics\nAssess differences among means by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare differences between genotype and by two-way ANOVA to compare differences between genotype and toxicant treatment. Utilize Tukey’s HSD post hoc analysis when differences are observed by ANOVA testing (p≤0.05).\n\tNote: experiments (with n = 6-9 mice/group) are performed a minimum of two times to ensure reproducibility.\nSubscription Required.
