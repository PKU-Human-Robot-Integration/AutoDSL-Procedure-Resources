  "procedures": [
    "The protocol to generate aligned functional myocardial tissue can be divided into three major parts. The fabrication of the micropatterned master using soft lithography techniques is not considered part of the following protocol but can be made based on established method6.\n1. Microcontact Printing of Fibronectin onto PDMS Substrates\nMix Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning) PDMS elastomer at a 10:1 base to curing agent ratio and degas the assembly using a desiccator to eliminate any air bubbles.\nCure PDMS against a previously fabricated master with 20 μm wide and 2 μm tall ridges, separated by 20 μm spacing for either 2 days at room temperature or 4 hr at 65 °C to obtain microtextured PDMS stamps.\n* Curing in a desiccator is highly recommended to eliminate any air bubbles.\nSpin coat PDMS onto glass cover slips (e.g. 22x22 mm) at 5,000 rpm for 2 min using a Headway Spin Coater to produce thin and even PDMS substrates of 15 μm thickness.\nClean stamps with 70% Ethanol to remove dust and dirt particles. Let them air dry.\n* Stamps can be used several times, however, renewing PDMS stamps on a regular basis is recommended due to a surface abrasion over time.\nPlace stamps in a SPI Plasma-Prep II Plasma Cleaner and process for 1 min at 275 mTorr to render PDMS surfaces hydrophilic.\n* Oxygen plasma treatment should be watched. Longer treatment times can result in cracking of the elastomer.\nSterilize stamps with 70% Ethanol for 1 min. Dry quickly with compressed air.\n* Further steps should be performed in a biological safety cabinet to maintain sterility.\nCover stamp surfaces with Fibronectin solution (50 μg/ml in ddH2O). Let it adsorb at least 10 min.\nShake off Fibronectin solution from stamps and dry quickly with compressed air.",
    "Establish conformal contact between stamps and PDMS substrates for 2 min and press firmly.\nRinse micropatterned substrates with ddH2O. Store them in ddH2O for a maximum of 2 weeks at 4 °C unless initially used. Store PDMS stamps in ddH2O.\n2. Maintenance of Double Transgenic Embryonic Stem Cell Lines\nFirst, prepare the following media for culturing mouse ES cells:\nMouse Embryonic Fibroblast (MEF)-Medium: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) ES cell- or Differentiation-grade, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (P/S)\nEmbryonic Stem Cell (ESC)-Medium: DMEM, 15% FBS ES cell-grade, 1% Non-Essential Amino Acids (NEAA), 0.5% P/S, 0.2% Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), 0.0007% 2-Mercaptoethanol (2-ME)\nCoat 6-well plates with sterile 0.1% Gelatin in ddH2O and let it adsorb 15 min at 37 °C.\nAdd MEFs from a thawed aliquot to 50 ml PBS in a conical tube and centrifuge them at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. Resuspend MEFs in MEF-medium.\nAfter adsorption, aspirate excess Gelatin and add MEFs into the wells. Allow MEFs 1 day to attach.\n* An aliquot of 10 million MEFs suffices for 3 6-well plates.\nWhen MEFs have attached, add ES cells from a thawed aliquot to 50 ml PBS in a conical tube and centrifuge them at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. Resuspend ES cells in ESC-medium and add them to the wells containing MEFs. Culture ES cells in ESC-medium until confluence is reached.\n* Once ES cells have reached confluence, passaging is required to avoid overgrowth and to maintain ES cell colonies.\nPrepare ES cells for passaging. Aspirate ESC-medium and wash once with sterile PBS.\nAspirate PBS and add 500 μl of Trypsin. Process 3.5 min at 37 °C.\nPipette the Trypsin solution up and down several times to break down ES cell colonies and neutralize it with 500 μl of ESC-medium.",
    "Passage ES cells according to your desired ratio, e.g. transfer 33 μl to another well with previously prepared MEFs to passage 1/30. Maintain ES cells in ESC-Medium.\n* A passage ratio of 1/30 allows ES cells to reach confluence within 3 days. Passage ES cells according to your in vitro differentiation schedule.\n3. In vitro Differentiation of Double Transgenic Embryonic Stem Cell Lines and Isolation and Seeding of Cardiac Progenitors\nFirst, prepare the following media required for the in vitro differentiation of ES cells:\nAdaptation-Medium: Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM), 15% FBS ES cell-grade, 1% NEAA, 0.5% P/S, 0.2% LIF, 0.0007% 2-ME\nDifferentiation-Medium: IMDM, 15% FBS Differentiation-grade. 1% NEAA, 0.5% P/S, 0.35% of 0.1M Ascorbic Acid, 0.0007% 2-ME\nStart in vitro differentiation when ES cells have reached confluence. Coat 10 cm culture dishes with sterile 0.1% Gelatin in ddH2O and let it adsorb 15 min at 37 °C.\n* Be aware of the duration of the in vitro differentiation process. It takes 8 days until cardiac progenitors can be isolated. Plan your experiments accordingly.\nHarvest ES cells as before. After adsorption, aspirate excess Gelatin and add approximately 1/3-1/2 of the ES cell suspension to prepared culture dishes containing Adaptation-medium. Culture cells for 2 days.\n* Choose the amount of ES cells for adaptation according to your experiments.\nHarvest adapted ES cells into a 50 ml conical tube containing PBS using 1. 5 ml of Trypsin. Centrifuge dissociated ES cells at 1,000 rpm for 5 min and resuspend them in Differentiation-medium.\nMake embryoid bodies (EBs) of approximately 1,000 cells per 10 μl drop in 15 cm culture dishes using a multi-channel pipette. Invert the plates and culture EBs as hanging droplets for 2.5 days at 37 °C.",
    "After 2.5 days, pool EBs of 6-8 15 cm culture dishes into one using Differentiation-medium and culture them for a further 3.5 days at 37 °C.\nAfter 3.5 days, collect EBs in a conical 50 ml tube and let them sink to the bottom for approximately 5 min. Suck up the supernatant and wash EBs with sterile PBS. Let EBs sink again to the bottom for approximately 5 min.\nDissociate EBs by processing them with 2. 5 ml of Trypsin for 2 min in a water bath at 37 °C shaking the tube softly. Then, add 2. 5 ml of sterile PBS to the Trypsin solution and pipette up and down with a 10 ml serological pipette approximately 8-10 times to break down cell clusters. Neutralize Trypsin with 10 ml of FACS buffer containing 7.5% FBS ES cell- or Differentiation-grade and 0.01% DAPI in PBS.\nCentrifuge dissociated EBs at 1,000 rpm for 5 min and resuspend them in approximately 1 ml of FACS buffer. Pipette up and down with a 1 ml pipette approximately 8-10 times to break down cell clusters.\n* Add FACS buffer according to the estimated amount of dissociated EBs. Too highly concentrated cells may clog during FACS and too low concentrated cells may prolong FACS time unnecessarily.\nTransfer cells to a sterile round-bottom tube with a 35 μm cell strainer to obtain a single cell suspension.\nSort differentiated ES cells using a FACSAria Flow Cytometer and obtain purified populations of CVP.",
    "*We developed a multi-step gating strategy to isolate highly purified colored cells. In brief, we first gate on Forward Scatter Amplitude (FSC-A) and Side Scatter Amplitude (SSC-A) (Figure 1A). This allows us to separate whole cells from cellular debris. We then gate on FSC-A and Forward Scatter-Width (FSC-W) (Figure 1B). This allows us to isolate cell singlets from doublets and other cellular aggregates. We then gate on SSC-A and Side Scatter-Width (SSC-W) (Figure 1C). This increases the purity of cell singlets. We then gate on DAPI staining to isolate viable cells (DAPI-negative) from non-viable cells (Figure 1D). We then gate on Phycoeryhthrin Amplitude (PE-A) and PE-Cyanine dye 7 Amplitude (PE-Cy7-A) to obtain true red-positive (R+) and true red-negative (R-) cells and to exclude autofluorescent red-negative cells (Figure 1E). R+ and R- cells are then gated separately on Fluorescein isothiocyanate Amplitude (FITC-A) and PE-A to sort true green-positive (G+) and true green-negative (G-) cells within these populations (Figure 1F+1G). This results in 4 populations of cells as follows: R+G+, R+G-, R-G+ and R-G- (Figure 1H).\nPassivate micropatterned substrates with 1% Pluronic F-127 in ddH2O for 10 min. Then, wash them 3x with sterile PBS.\n* Pluronic F-127 is a surfactant that blocks cell adhesion. It supports confinement of cell adhesion to micropatterned area.\nAttach PDMS gaskets around the patterned region and press firmly. Then, seed CVP onto Fibronectin micropatterned substrates.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
