    "Approval was obtained for the collection of human-biopsied tissues from patient tumors (1912208231R001, University of Arizona Human Subjects Protection Program; IRB protocol number: 1099985869R001 , University of Arizona Human Subjects Protection Program TARGHETS).\n1. Establishing patient-derived gastric organoids from biopsies\nCollect 1-2 mm of human biopsied tissues from the tumor region of gastic cancer patients undergoing esophageal gastro-duodenoscopy in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Table 1).\n\tNOTE: All procedures henceforth should be conducted in an aseptic environment using sterile materials and reagents.\nMince the biopsied tissues using scalpel blades on a Petri dish. Transfer the minced tissues to a 15 ml conical tube and add 5-10 mL of 1x PBS.\nCentrifuge at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant. Add 1-2 mL of prewarmed digestion buffer (Table 1) to the pelleted tissues.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 15-30 min, depending on the size of the minced tissues. Monitor the status of digestion by looking under the microscope for small cell clusters every 5-10 min.\nStop the digestion by diluting 5-fold with cold Advanced Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium/Ham's F-12 medium (Advanced DMEM/F-12). If clumps of undigested material are visible, filter the tissues through 30 µm filters. Collect the flow-through.\nCentrifuge the flow-through at 300 × g for 5 min at room temperature to pellet the cells. Discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pelleted cells (10,000-100,000) in an appropriate volume (2-4 mL) of thawed basement membrane matrix (see the Table of Materials) on ice. Seed as 30-50 µL cell-basement membrane matrix drops in 24-well culture plates.\nIncubate the plates at 37 °C for 15 min to allow the cell-basement membrane matrix drops to solidify. Overlay the cell-basement membrane matrix drops with prewarmed gastric organoid culture medium (Table 1).",
    "Maintain organoid cultures at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Replace the culture medium with fresh medium every 3-4 days, depending on the organoid growth. Passage the organoids once every 7-10 days in a 1:3 ratio.\n2. Establishing patient-derived gastric organoids from surgical specimens\nCollect human gastric cancer tissues from resected specimens of gastric cancer patients during surgical procedures in 1x Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) supplemented with antibiotics (Table 1).\n\tNOTE: All procedures hereafter should be processed in a biosafety cabinet, maintaining an aseptic environment and using sterile materials and reagents.\nMince the resected tissues using surgical scalpel blades on a Petri dish. Wash the minced tissues with 5-10 mL of 1x DPBS containing antibiotics.\nTransfer the tissue to a 50 mL conical tube. Add 10 mL of prewarmed ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) stripping buffer to the minced tissues. Monitor the status of digestion every 5-10 min. Incubate the tube in a 37 °C shaker for 10 min.\nLet the tissues settle at the bottom of the tube, remove the EDTA buffer without disturbing the tissues, and add 10 mL of fresh EDTA buffer. Incubate the tube in a 37 °C shaker for 5 min.\nLet the tissues settle at the bottom of the tube. Remove the EDTA buffer and wash the tissues twice (follow step 2.4) with 10 mL of advanced DMEM/F-12 supplemented with antibiotics (no centrifuge) (Table 1).\nAdd 5-10 mL of prewarmed digestion buffer (Table 1) to the tissues, depending on the tissue size. Incubate the tube at 37 °C for 15-30 min with mild agitation, depending on the size and texture of the tissues. Check for the appearance of cell clusters under a microscope every 10 min.",
    "Stop the digestion by diluting two-fold with cold Advanced DMEM/F-12 plus antibiotics. Filter the undigested tissues through 40 µm filters and collect the flow-through.\nCentrifuge the flow-through at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the cells. Discard the supernatant, and wash the cells with cold 1x DPBS plus antibiotics at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Carefully discard the supernatant, and store the cells on ice.\nResuspend the pelleted cells in an appropriate volume of the basement membrane matrix on ice. Seed 30-50 µL cell-basement membrane matrix drops in 24- or 12-well cell culture-treated plates.\nIncubate the plates at 37 °C for 15 min to allow the cell-basement membrane matrix drops to solidify as a dome. Overlay the cell-basement membrane matrix dome with prewarmed gastric organoid culture medium (Table 1).\nMaintain the organoid cultures at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Replace the culture medium with fresh medium every 3-4 days, depending on the organoid growth. Passage the organoids once every 7-10 days in a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio, based on the organoid density.\n3. Maintenance and expansion of organoid cultures\nNOTE : All procedures should be conducted in an aseptic environment using sterile materials and reagents.\nMaintenance and expansion\n\t\nMaintain the organoid cultures for 7-10 days until they are 70-80% confluent. Harvest the organoids in ice-cold DMEM. Transfer the organoids to 5 mL round-bottom polystyrene tubes.\nCentrifuge the organoids at 400 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet cells.

Repeat the passaging of the cells once every 7-10 days in a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio, based on the cell density.\n\t\t\nTo coat the plates with basement membrane matrix, dilute the matrix in ice-cold cell culture grade water in a 1:10 ratio. Uniformly coat the plate with 1 mL of ice-cold diluted matrix solution using a cell spreader, and incubate the coated plate at 37 °C for 2 h. Remove the remaining coating solution and let the plate dry without the lid inside the biosafety hood for 30 min, right before plating the cells.\nTo coat the plates with gelatin, uniformly coat the plate with 1 mL of an ice-cold gelatin-based coating solution. Incubate the coated plate at room temperature for 5 min. Remove the remaining gelatin solution and plate the resuspended cells.\n4. Culturing immune cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)\nNOTE: All procedures should be conducted in an aseptic environment using sterile materials and reagents.\nPBMC isolation\n\t\nDilute whole blood with an equal volume of 1x PBS.\nDepending on the total volume of the diluted blood sample, dispense an appropriate volume of density gradient medium (see the Table of Materials) into a 15 mL tube.\n\t\tNOTE: The recommended ratio is 3 mL of the density gradient medium to 4 mL of the diluted blood sample.\nCarefully layer the diluted blood sample onto the density gradient medium. Centrifuge at 400 × g for 30 min-1 h without brake.",
    "After centrifugation, carefully transfer the mononuclear cells at the interface into a new 15 mL conical tube.
