    "All animal care protocols were approved by the University of British Columbia's Animal Care Committee in accordance with the Canadian Council on Animal Care guidelines.\n1. Brain digestion for microglia isolation\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65080/65080fig01.jpg\nFigure 1: Simple flow chart of the protocol. The mice are first transcardially perfused with HBSS, and the brain is dissected. The brain is then dissociated through chemical digestion and mechanical disruption to result in a single cell homogenate. The immune enriched fraction is collected via discontinuous density gradient, after which the cells are stained for P2RY12. Stained cells are either 1) sorted via fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) to lead to RNA analysis or downstream protein analysis and/or 2) fixed, permeabilized, and stained for intranuclear proteins. The protein level is quantified by median fluorescence intensity in the channel of interest determined by flow cytometry. Boxes colored in blue are part of protocol step 1) Brain digestion for microglia isolation. Boxes colored in red are part of protocol step 2) Intranuclear flow staining for protein expression analysis. Created with BioRender.com.

However, this is not required if just assessing protein signal as the cells are largely quiescent when kept on ice.\n\t\nFluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (20 mL per sample): Dissolve bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1x Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) to create a 2% BSA solution. Dissolve EDTA to a final concentration of 1 mM in the 2% BSA solution. Filter sterilize using a 0.2 µm filter and store at 4 °C for up to 1 week prior to use.",
    "Digestion buffer (1 mL per sample): Reconstitute a vial of papain in HBSS to a final concentration of 20 U/mL in 1 mM L-cysteine with 0.5 mM EDTA. Activate at 37 °C for a minimum of 10 min or until ready to digest tissue. Just prior to use, add DNase I to the activated papain solution to a final concentration of 200 U/mL. Prepare this on the day of experiment and do not store.\nIsotonic density gradient solution (5.5 mL per sample): Add 10x HBSS to cold density gradient medium to a final concentration of 1x HBSS, resulting in a final density of 1.117 g/mL. Vortex to mix for at least 30 s prior to use. Place on ice until use.\n37% density gradient solution (4 mL per sample): Add isotonic density gradient to 1x HBSS to make a final concentration of 37% with a final density of 1.043 g/mL. Add 20 µL of phenol red for each mL of 37% density gradient to make a pink solution for visualization during layering. Vortex for at least 30 s prior to use. Place on ice until use.\n70% density gradient solution (2 mL per sample): Add isotonic density gradient to 1x HBSS to make a final concentration of 70% with a final density of 1.082 g/mL. Add 5 µL of trypan blue for each mL of 70% density medium to make a blue solution for visualization during layering. Vortex for at least 30 s prior to use. Place on ice until use.\nPerfusion and brain dissection",
    "NOTE: The perfusion protocol is similar to Posel et al. which features video depiction of mouse thoracotomy, transcardial perfusion, and brain removal21. Here, we use adult C57BL/6J male and female mice (10-15 weeks old, 20-30 g), but this protocol can be used to perform a thoracotomy for any mouse. All animal procedures must be approved by the institutional ethics committee prior to conducting experiments.\n\t\nMouse anesthesia: Anaesthetize mice with 4% Isoflurane in 100% oxygen until past the plane of surgical anesthesia, which can be confirmed with a toe pinch, or a lack of reflex upon firmly pinching the mouse's foot. Place the mouse on its back and firmly pin its four paws down into the surgical dissection board placed tilted in a plastic tray, ensuring the nose is secured into the isofluorane nose cone. After transfer, ensure the animal is still past the surgical plane of anesthesia before proceeding.\nMouse thoracotamy: Grab and lift the abdominal skin using forceps and make a shallow incision through the skin and abdominal wall to expose the xyphoid without damaging the descending aorta or any underlying organs.\nGrip the xyphoid with forceps and make lateral incisions beneath the ribcage to expose the diaphragm and liver. Make careful shallow cuts through the diaphragm along the length of the rib cage using fine scissors and through the ribcage using tissue scissors and pin the sternum to the surgical station near the head of the mouse to expose the heart and lungs for transcardial perfusion.\nTranscardial perfusion: Prepare a peristaltic perfusion pump and attach a 26.5G needle onto one end of the tubing. Prime the tubing for the procedure by inserting one end of the tubing into a vial of cold 1x HBSS and switching on the pump to completely fill the tubing with 1x HBSS.",
    "While holding the heart with blunt forceps, insert the tip of a 26.5G needle with the attached perfusion tubing into the left ventricle of the heart and make a small incision in the right atrium. Turn on the perfusion pump to carefully perfuse the mouse at a rate of ~2-4 mL/min with at least 15-20 mL of cold 1x HBSS.\n\t\tNOTE: A complete perfusion is often indicated when the liver begins to clear blood and becomes the same color as the heart.\nBrain removal: Decapitate the mouse using tissue dissecting scissors and make a midline incision in the scalp from neck to nose. Peel the skin flaps to the sides to expose the skull and remove excess tissue and bones at the caudal end of the skull with dissecting scissors.\nCarefully slide one blade of the scissors under the skull into the foramen magnum with the sharp side facing the bone and carefully cut up the midline toward the nose. Make lateral cuts at both the base of the skull and near the nose using dissecting scissors. Using fine forceps, life the skull from the midline to the exterior to crack off the skull pieces and expose the brain. Gently lift the brain with a spatula and place on dissection blot paper.\nBrain dissection: Place the brain on a piece of dissection blot paper wetted with 1x HBSS on top of a closed Petri dish filled with ice. Remove the cerebellum and bisect the brain hemispheres using a clean razor blade.\nRemove the brainstem, striatum, and white matter from each hemisphere, while keeping the hippocampus and overlaying cortex intact. Transfer the hemispheres containing isolated cortex and hippocampal tissue into a 15 mL tube with 5 mL of cold 1x HBSS and keep on ice.",
    "NOTE: It is important to perform the dissections as quickly as possible so that the tissue remains cold with no more than 2 min between decapitation and final placing of dissected tissue in 1x HBSS on ice. If isolating microglia from multiple animals, brains can be stored on ice in 1x HBSS for ~1 h before proceeding with processing the entire cohort of animals for digestion etc.\nBrain digestion and homogenization\n\t\nMechanical and chemical dissociation: Place the brain tissue from each mouse and 1 mL of digestion buffer into individual Petri dishes on ice. Using a clean scalpel blade, thoroughly chop the brain into small pieces (<1 mm).\nCut the tip off a plastic transfer pipette and carefully transfer each of the minced brains into separate wells within a 24-well plate on ice. Cover the plate with transparent flexible film and incubate on ice for 30 min.\n\t\tNOTE: When chopped correctly, the brain tissue resembles well-minced garlic.\nDounce homogenization: Transfer digested brain solution from each well into individual 7 mL glass dounce homogenizers on ice each filled with 5 mL of cold FACS buffer. Dounce each brain gently with the loose pestle (A), approximately 30-40 times, until a single cell suspension is obtained. After douncing with the A pestle, gently dounce with the tight pestle (B) 3-4 times to ensure a single cell suspension.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not push the pestle more than ¾ of the way down to avoid crushing the tissue at the bottom of the homogenizer. The final solution should be opaque and milky.",
    "NOTE: If digesting multiple brains in a single experiment, time the transfer of the brain digest into FACS buffer so that each sample is only in the digest buffer for 30 min. Over-digestion can result in cleavage of surface proteins, reducing downstream antibody binding and signal.\nObtaining immune enriched fragment\n\t\nEstablishing density gradient: Transfer the homogenate from each brain into separate 15 mL polypropylene tubes and add 2.125 mL of isotonic density gradient and top to 8.5 mL with FACS buffer for each to obtain a final concentration of 25% density gradient. Gently invert the 15 ml tubes 20x to mix thoroughly.\nUsing a narrow-graduated transfer pipette, gently underlay 4 mL of 37% density gradient to each tube, being very careful to establish clean layers. Switch transfer pipettes and gently underlay 2 mL of 70% density gradient (Figure 2A). Transfer to a centrifuge cooled to 4 °C and spin at 500 x g for 20 min with the braking ramp set to zero.\nCollecting immune enriched fragment: Using clean transfer pipettes, gently aspirate the myelin from the top of the volume in the 15 mL tube using a clean transfer pipette and discard. Carefully collect the top fragment of the density gradient into a clean 15 mL polypropylene tube using a transfer pipette.\nCarefully collect the immune enriched fragment (1.5 mL above and 1.5 mL below where the 70% and 37% density gradient layers meet) into a new 15 mL polypropylene tube (Figure 2B). Add 10 mL of FACS buffer to the immune-enriched sample to dilute out the density gradient medium and invert the tube gently 20x to mix thoroughly.",
    "NOTE: As cells tend to stick to the sides of the tube, ensure to gather all cells in the sample during the collection steps by slowly circling the pipette along the sides of the tube while collecting the liquid.\nPellet the cells in the immune-enriched sample by centrifuging the 15 mL tubes in a 4 °C centrifuge at 500 x g for 10 min with the downhill ramp brake set to zero. Immediately upon the end of the spin, remove the supernatant carefully, leaving approximately 300 µL of liquid in the 15 mL tube, being careful not to disturb the pellet (which may not be visible).\nCollect the supernatant in another 15 mL tube to ensure that the cells were pelleted in the spin (discard this fraction once verification with the cell counts of the resuspended pellet is done). After resuspending the cell pellet in the 300 µL volume using a P1000 pipette, count cells with a hemacytometer to estimate the total cell yield.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65080/65080fig02.jpg",
    "Figure 2: Obtaining the immune enriched fragment by discontinuous density gradient. (A) The brain homogenate is made to 25% density medium, underlay 4 mL of 37% density medium colored pink via phenol red and 2 mL of 70% density medium colored blue via trypan blue. (B) Following centrifugation, the fractions have separated. Microglia rests at the interface of 37% and 70% density media fragments. The myelin fragment is at the top of the 15 mL tube and will be discarded. The top fragment is collected as back up in case the spin fails, and no cells are recovered. If that occurs, the gradient can be repeated using this fraction. The immune enriched fraction is collected downstream. The bottom fraction containing any red blood cells remains in the tube and is discarded. (C) Example figure depicting complete layers. Created with BioRender.com.

Quickly remove the supernatant in the sink by flicking the plate to dispose of the supernatant, leaving the cell pellet intact at the bottom of the well.\nResuspend the cells in 50 µL of FACS buffer with anti-mouse CD16/32 FC-Receptor blocking reagent using a P200 pipette (final concentration 10 µg/mL, dilution factor 1:50) to prevent non-specific binding of antibodies to monocytes or other FcR bearing cells. Incubate for 10 min on ice.",
    "Antibody staining: Prepare the appropriate volume of a 2x master mix containing P2RY12- Allophycocyanin (APC; dilution factor 1:50, concentration 4 µg/mL for a final well concentration of 1:100, concentration 2 µg/mL) and violet 525 live dead stain (dilution factor 1:50 for a final well concentration of 1:100). Add 50 µL of the staining master mix to the cell suspension (obtained after blocking in section 1.5.1) and incubate the plate for 30 min in the dark on ice.\n\t\tNOTE: For this protocol, we present staining the cells with P2RY12. Firstly, P2RY12 is a homeostatic marker for microglia that can be downregulated in certain disease contexts. For example, 5XFAD Alzheimer's model mice have downregulated P2RY12 levels which might make them difficult to identify22. Alternative stains that can be used for the isolation include Tmem119, Cd11b and CD4523. Secondly, the conjugate fluorochrome APC can be adjusted to suit the desired panel of antibodies. However, choosing a bright fluorochrome, such as APC or PE, will help to ensure the positive and negative populations are easily distinguishable24.\nAfter staining, add 200 µL of FACS buffer directly to each well to wash the cells. Spin at 500 x g at 4 °C to remove supernatant by flicking. Resuspend cells in 200 µL of FACS buffer with a P200 pipette, spin at 500 x g at 4 °C, and flick plate to remove buffer from wells.\nPreparing flow controls: Prior to staining, separate necessary volumes of cells from each sample after blocking in step 1.5.1 for the required flow controls.",
    "NOTE: Flow controls are required for each experiment to establish the gates. The flow controls can be taken from an additional animal or from a fraction of each of the experimental wells. When splitting cells ensure to assign enough cells per control as 10,000-30,000 cells per control is required to establish gates with high confidence.\n\t\t\nThere are three relevant flow controls: no stain, live dead, and P2RY12 isotype control. For the no stain control, do not add any antibody. In the P2RY12 isotype control, treat cells with viability dye (1:100) and an isotype control antibody conjugated to APC (1:100).\nTo prepare the live dead control, aliquot cells into a separate well and move half of the cell volume into a 500 µL tube. Place the 500 µL tube into the -80 °C freezer for 5 min, followed placing in 37 °C incubator for 5 min to kill the cells. Return the aliquot of dead cells into the live dead control well and stain with an amine binding viability dye on violet 525 (dilution factor 1:100) to mark dead cells.",
    "NOTE: The protocol is written for plate staining with a flick method for supernatant removal. However, this requires the supernatant to be removed immediately following completion of the spin and the flick needs to be done with enough force to quickly remove the supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Alternatively, 1.5 mL RNAse/DNase free tubes can be used for the staining, with the following modifications: Transfer cells into 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and pellet at 800 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Aspirate supernatant with pipettes. Tip: For speed, a 5 mL transfer pipette with a P200 tip can quickly and accurately aspirate the supernatant. When aspirating, check for the pellet. If pellet is not visible, leave 50 µL of supernatant and adjust calculations accordingly. When washing out antibodies, add additional FACS to increase the dilution of antibodies (1000 µL instead of 200 µL) to account for incomplete removal of supernatant. Depending on the cytometer, use the 1.5 mL tubes for sorting, reducing the amount of supplies required.\nFACS sorting for microglia\n\t\nPreparation: Resuspend each well in 200 µL of FACS buffer with a P200 pipette and transfer into labelled flow sort tubes and add FACS buffer to a total of 500 µL for a concentration of approximately 5 x 105 events per mL. Store on ice in the dark until analysis. Prepare post sort tubes by adding 100 µL of FACS buffer as a cushion for cells in 1.5 mL RNAse free tubes.\nCytometer settings: Sort cells on a flow cytometry cell sorter set up with the 100 µm nozzle. Sort cells using 18-20 psi.",
    "Gating: On the cytometer, gate for cell size using side-scatter (SSC) area versus forward scatter (FSC) height using the no stain control to help distinguish debris, put SSC-A on a log axis to visualize a cell population and gate closely to select for cells (gate S1; Figure 3). To remove any doublets, plot FSC-H vs FSC-W and gate closely around the cell population removing any debris and doublets (gate S2). Using the P2RY12 isotype control, examine the cells in the APC channel and set the gate for autofluorescence to determine P2RY12+ cells. Using the no stain and live dead controls, gate for the cells that are not fluorescent on violet 525 nm as live cells.\nSorting: Plot violet 525 nm vs APC and determine the population that is P2RY12+ and live by FMOs (MG). Sort those cells into the labelled post sort tube (Figure 3). The final sort percentage is approximately 50% of the total events with the majority of event total loss being debris removed in gate S1 (~70% of events are cells; Table 1).\nRNA isolation and analysis\n\t\nTranscription and translation inhibitors: If planning RNA extraction, to eliminate the risk of isolation associated transcriptomic signatures, include inhibitors of translation and transcription in the buffer steps. Prepare the inhibitor cocktail as described by Marsh et al. including actinomycin D, anisomycin and triptolide25.\n\t\t\nInhibitor preparation: Reconstitute inhibitor stocks and store as follows: Reconstitute actinomycin D in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to 5 mg/mL and store at -20 °C. Reconstitute triptolide in DMSO to 10 mM and store at -20 °C, protected from light. Reconstitute Anisomycin in DMSO to 10 mg/mL and stored at 4 °C, protected from light. Store all inhibitor stocks for no longer than 1 month after being reconstituted.",
    "Buffer modifications: Add inhibitors in four different buffers in the protocol as follows: When performing the transcardial perfusion, prepare HBSS with actinomycin D (5 µg/mL, 1:1000 from stock) and triptolide (10 µM, 1:1000 from stock). Following perfusion, transport brains to the lab in HBSS containing actinomycin D (5 µg/mL, 1:1000 from stock), triptolide (10 µM, 1:1000 from stock) and anisomycin (27.1 µg/mL, 1:368.5 from stock). Prepare FACS buffer with actinomycin D (5 µg/mL, 1:1000 from stock), triptolide (10 µM, 1:1000 from stock) and anisomycin (27.1 µg/mL, 1:368.5 from stock). Prepare digestion buffer with actinomycin D (5 µg/mL, 1:1000 from stock), triptolide (10 µM, 1:1000 from stock) and anisomycin (27.1 µg/mL, 1:368.5 from stock).Prepare post sort wash buffer, with HBSS containing actinomycin D (5 µg/mL, 1:1000 from stock), triptolide (10 µM, 1:1000 from stock) and anisomycin (27.1 µg/mL, 1:368.5 from stock).\n\t\t\tNOTE: When adding the inhibitors, ensure to add them immediately prior to use and protect any prepared buffers from light while in use. Avoid freeze-thaws of stock solutions.\nPost-sort washes: Because the cells have been sorted into 1.5 mL RNase free tubes in FACS buffer, which will interfere with RNA isolation, it is necessary to wash the cells. Spin the cells at 1000 x g at 4 °C for 5 min and remove supernatant, leaving approximately 50 µL of liquid.\nAdd 200 µL of 1x HBSS containing actinomycin D (5 µg/mL, 1:1000 from stock), triptolide (10 µM, 1:1000 from stock) and anisomycin (27.1 µg/mL, 1:368.5 from stock) and mix thoroughly. Repeat the spin and remove supernatant leaving 50 µL of liquid (wash 1). Add 200 µL of post sort wash buffer, mix thoroughly and repeat the spin and remove supernatant leaving 25 µL of liquid (wash 2).",
    "RNA extraction: For RNA isolation from microglial cells, use a low-input RNA isolation kit for high and consistent RNA yields and RIN scores above 9 (see below and Table of Materials for product recommendations). To the cell pellet, add 350 µL of the lysis buffer from recommended kit + β-mercaptoethanol (1:100) and mix well.\n\t\t​NOTE: If necessary, the protocol can be suspended at this point. Samples can be stored in the lysis buffer in the -80 °C until RNA extraction. If extracting RNA after storage, thaw the lysate on ice and proceed with the kit-specific instructions for the isolation.\nTransfer lysate into column-based cell shredder (see Table of Materials for product recommendations) and centrifuge at max speed at 4 °C for 2 min. Elute in a minimum of 14 µL of RNase-free water and determine the concentration as appropriate. RNA can be used for any downstream application after this point.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65080/65080fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Gating strategy for flow sort. Events are gated for cell size on SSC-A vs FSC-H (S1). Then, cells are gated to be singlets on FSC-H vs FSC-W (S2). Singlet cells are sorted as live if negative on Comp-FL8-A::405-526-52 (violet 525 live dead stain) and as P2RY12+ if positive on Comp-FL32-A::640-671_30 (P2RY12-APC) using the P2RY12-isotype control. Cells are labelled as MG and sorted if both live and P2RY12+.

Intranuclear flow staining for protein expression analysis",
    "NOTE: Other cell types can be started at this point, this protocol is tested with cultured cells including HEK293 cells, BV2 microglia-like cells, and human IPSC-derived microglia.\nFixation and staining of cells\n\tNOTE: For the following protocol, use an intracellular staining kit that is optimized for nuclear staining. See Table of Materials for product recommendations.\n\t\nAliquot extracellularly stained cells from section 1.5.2 into 96 well plate (5 x 104- 1 x 106 cells). Spin cells for 5 min at 500 x g at 4 °C and flick to remove FACS buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: To obtain data with high confidence of median levels, a minimum of 10,000 cells per well should be used. While there is no recommended maximum, it is best to keep the number of cells consistent throughout the experiment to ensure there is no significant effect of different coefficient of variations (CV).\nFixation and permeabilization: Add 200 µL of 1x fix concentrate and gently mix with P200 pipette to resuspend cells. Incubate in the dark for 45-60 min. Centrifuge plate for 5 min at 500 x g at room temperature (RT) and flick to discard supernatant.\n\t\tNOTE: If necessary, the protocol can be suspended at this point. After discarding supernatant, re-suspend cells in long-term storage buffer for immune cells (see Table of Materials for product recommendations). Samples can be stored at 4 °C for 12-18 h, protected from light and covered in transparent film to protect buffer evaporation.\nAdd 200 µL of 1x permeabilization buffer to each well and pipette with a P200 to mix. Centrifuge plate for 5 min at 500 x g at RT and flick to discard supernatant. Repeat permeabilization buffer wash a total of 3x.",
    "Preparing flow controls: Split volume of cells from each sample for the required flow controls (10,000-30,000 cells per control well is sufficient).\n\t\t\nTo prepare the no stain control, fix the no stain cells from the sort or aliquot unstained cells into a separate well that will not receive any antibody.\nTo prepare the fluorescence minus one (FMO) control, aliquot cells for each of the antibodies on the panel except the one in that channel.\nFor the relevant channels, include the isotype control antibody in the FMO for gating. For example, in a panel containing P2RY12-APC and H3K27Ac-AlexaFluor568 - there should be two FMOS: (1) the APC-FMO which contains only H3K27Ac-AlexaFluor568 and the P2RY12 isotype control antibody and (2) the 568-FMO which contains only P2RY12-APC and the isotype control primary and 568 secondary.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This protocol is presented to test a single HPTM, however panels can be established that contain many HPTMs conjugated to different fluorophores.\nPrimary antibody staining: Add 50 µL of 1x permeabilization buffer with the appropriate concentration of primary antibody to each well. Incubate for 30 min at RT in the dark. Wash 2x with 200 µL of 1x permeabilization buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: The concentration of antibodies used for each HPTM is included in the Table of Materials. The concentration is determined by testing different concentrations of the antibodies on cultured cells treated with a stimulant that would cause a dramatic increase, e.g., an HDAC inhibitor for acetylation marks and ensuring both untreated and treated cells were well within the range of detection (above the isotype control and below the maximum detection range of the cytometer). The optimal antibody concentration for HPTMs should have an average median fluorescent intensity in the fluorophore channel between 5 x 104 and 1 x 105.",
    "Secondary antibody staining: Block with 200 µL of 1x permeabilization buffer with 2% normal donkey serum (NDS) for 10 min at RT. Spin for 5 min at 500 x g at RT and flick to remove supernatant.\nAdd 50 µL of 1x permeabilization buffer with 2% NDS and the appropriate concentration of secondary antibody and incubate for 30 min at RT in the dark. Add 200 µL of 1x permeabilization buffer to wells to dilute, centrifuge the plate for 5 min at 500 x g at RT, and flick to discard supernatant. Wash cells 2x with 200 µL of 1x permeabilization buffer.\n\t\tNOTE: If necessary, suspend the protocol at this point. Resuspend cells in 200 µL of long-term storage buffer for immune cells with P200 pipette (see Table of Materials for recommendations) and store at 4 °C for 12-24 h protected from light.\nPreparing for flow cytometry: Centrifuge plate for 5 min at 500 x g at RT and flick to discard supernatant. Resuspend cells in 200 µL of FACS buffer using a P200 pipette for flow cytometry. Seal with transparent film for transport to the cytometer.\nFlow cytometry\n\t\nTo analyze the proposed antibody panel, ensure that the cytometer is equipped with at least four lasers including violet (405 nm), blue (488 nm), yellow (561 nm), and red (633 nm). The cytometer needs filters to detect FITC (blue-525 nm), KRO (violet-525 nm) PE (yellow-585 nm), and APC (red-660 nm). Add additional antibodies depending on the cytometer chosen.\nCalibration and standardization: At the start of each experiment, run rainbow fluorescent beads and adjust the photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage until the bead peaks are comparable to the target values run for previous experiments. This method of standardization allows for accommodation of equipment drift over time.",
    "Compensation: After the PMT voltage and gain has been set for the experiment, use antibody captured compensation beads to establish the compensation matrix for the panel of antibodies. This calculation will ensure that the fluorophores are not contributing to the changes of signal in other channels. This is increasingly necessary when multiplexing multiple antibodies.\nSize gating: In a dot plot, plot SSC-A on log vs FSC-H on linear. Gate out debris and select for cell size using the S1 gate. Select for singlet cells in a dot plot of FSC-W vs FSC-H and gate as S2. (Figure 4).\nEstablishing fluorophore gates: Using the relevant FMO for each fluorophore channel, establish the gates to determine what is a positive signal in each channel using single parameter histograms (Figure 4).\nMeasuring the samples: Carefully record the samples using the established gating strategy. Identify the microglia using P2RY12+ signal, determine the expression of the protein in the respective channels for the microglia only.\nFlow cytometry data analysis\n\t\nEstablishing analysis gates: Using the above steps for the cytometer on the analysis software user interface, use the same gates used for recording for analysis.\nObtain MFI values using flow cytometry analysis software (see Table of Materials for recommendations): Recapitulate the cytometer gating strategy for flow analysis. Using the add statistics function, select median for the population of interest (e.g., 568+) on the compensated channel height. Using the table editor, export the median fluorescent intensity (MFI) values for the respective channels into a spreadsheet to proceed with statistical analysis (Table 2).\n\t\tNOTE: Supplementary File S1 includes example data from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) injected mice and an example analysis file with the gating strategy and MFI values.",
    "Analyzing MFI values to protein fold change: After obtaining the MFI values, calculate the fold change of the MFI relative to the control or untreated population (Equation 1). The MFI fold change is reflective of the fold change in protein levels. Using the fold change values, assess the change in expression and calculate the statistical significance using a t-test or ANOVA.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65080/65080eq01.jpg    Equation 1\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/65080/65080fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Gating strategy for protein MFI assessment. Events are gated first for cell size on SSC-A vs FSC-H (S1). The cells are then gated for singlets on FSC-H vs FSC-W (S2). Singlet cells are then identified as microglia by P2RY12-APC signal (APC+) with the gate established based on fluorescence in an APC-FMO control which contains an isotype control antibody. Cells are then gated for H3K27Ac-AlexaFluor568 signal on Comp-FL5-A::Y610-mCherry. The fluorescent intensity of the 610+ cells is determined as a proxy for protein expression.
