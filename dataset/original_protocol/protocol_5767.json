    "Note: The dialysis and precipitation steps do not cause losses of HA fragments as small as 4 kDa. HA extraction from mouse mammary glandMammary glands were isolated from 8 weeks old C57Bl/6 female mice as described in Tolg et al. (in review) Steps 2-3. The typical HA yield is 5-15 µg/100 mg tissue. Add 800 µl of tissue lysis buffer to 50-200 mg mammary gland tissue. Incubate samples 16-24 h at 55 °C. Mix samples during incubation, an Eppendorf Thermomixer at 500 rpm mixing speed works well. The following day, centrifuge digested samples at 18,000 x g (13,000 rpm) for 5 min at room temperature. This step removes undigested debris. Dispose of undigested debris as a biohazard. Pour the supernatant into a new Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube. Increase the NaCl concentration of the sample to 2 M by adding 11.7 mg NaCl powder/100 µl sample. Dissolve the NaCl powder by inverting samples end over end 10 times, then let samples sit for 1 min to allow undissolved NaCl crystals sink to the bottom of the tube where they will be visible. If necessary, repeat mixing until NaCl is dissolved. It takes a few minutes for the NaCl to dissolve. Remove proteinase K by chloroform extraction: Determine the sample volume and add the same volume of chloroform to the sample and mix by turning the sample upside down several times. Centrifuge the sample for 10 min at 18,000 x g (13,000 rpm) to separate aqueous and chloroform phases. Transfer the upper aqueous phase (Figure 1) into a new Eppendorf tube and repeat the chloroform extraction (Step A6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180530/20180530222228_9847.jpgFigure 1. Separation of aqueous and chloroform phases. After centrifugation the aqueous (top) and chloroform (bottom) phases are clearly visible.",
    "Centrifuge the sample for 10 min at 18,000 x g (13,000 rpm) and transfer the upper aqueous phase into a new Eppendorf tube. Reduce NaCl concentration by dialysis against 0.1 M NaCl: Remove 80% of the aqueous phase of each sample and transfer into two MINI Dialysis Units (7,000 MWCO, 0.1 ml capacity). Add the Dialysis Units to a beaker with 4 L of 0.1 M NaCl and dialyze for 2 h at 4 °C. During dialysis, slowly stir the 0.1 M NaCl using a magnetic stirring plate.Precipitate HA by Ethanol precipitation: Transfer samples from the Dialysis unit into 1.5 ml micro-centrifuge tubes, add 4 vol of 100% EtOH, mix and then store 16-24 h at -20 °C. Samples can be stored at -20 °C for up to one week. Centrifuge samples for 30 min at 18,000 x g (13,000 rpm), 4 °C.Remove supernatant and discard as chemical waste. Add 500 µl cold 70% EtOH to the pellet. Mix and repeat centrifugation for 10 min at 18,000 x g (13,000 rpm), 4 °C. Remove supernatant and discard as chemical waste. Allow HA pellet to dry by keeping sample tubes open under the cell culture or laminar flow hood for 1 h. Remove co-precipitated DNA by digestion with the nuclease Benzonase: Dissolve HA pellet in 100 µl of 50 mM Tris pH 8.3, 20 mM NaCl, containing 500 U Benzonase and digest for 4 h at 37 °C.Increase the NaCl concentration of the sample to 2 M by dissolving 11.7 mg NaCl powder directly in the sample as described in Step A5.Determine the sample volume and add the same volume of chloroform to the sample and mix by turning the sample upside down several times.",

This technique is able to remove some non-HA contaminants and to fractionate a polydisperse HA sample into low polydispersity (i.e., narrow size range) fractions between ca. 7 and 100 kDa, but does not subfractionate the higher molecular mass HA components. No preferential sample loss for any size of HA in IEX fractionation is observed.",
    "Very high molecular mass HA can also be washed out from the column without sample loss, due to the porous structure (3µ) of the column material (a regenerated cellulose-based membrane). All relevant solutions and apparatus must be at room temperature before use. Temperature affects the size of HA eluted from the IEX column. If cold elution solutions are used, HA will be prematurely eluted at a lower salt concentration than expected. Elution reproducibility is also strongly dependent on centrifugation time and force applied to the IEX columns. The centrifugal force and time applied to the IEX spin column need to be kept constant, and the force is recommended to be no higher than 400 x g. Higher force can result in premature release of HA from the column.The passed liquid is collected in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes with caps open and pointed toward the center of the rotor. Always align the printed letter Q in the IEX column toward the center of the fixed angle rotor, so that the solution can pass through the column resin uniformly. For each step, centrifuge at 400 x g for 2-5 min. It is recommended to spin for 2 min and check to see if the solution has passed. Spin for 1 min at a time and check repeatedly until all of the solution has passed. It is important not to over spin the columns. Do not wait for long periods between elution steps, as the column may dry out and prevent proper elution of the solutions and sample.If the sample volume is much larger than 400 µl, several columns may be used. This works better than repeated loading of a single column.The sample pH should be higher than ~5. The pKa for HA is ~3.",
    "2, and the pH of the NaCl solution is ~5.6.Elution using NaCl concentrations of 0.9 to 2.0 M elute sulfated glycosaminoglycans. Sample preparationHA samples are loaded in 0.1 M NaCl. The HA stock concentration should be less than about 0.5 µg/µl. You will use 400 µl of each sample. The maximum load is about 200 µg per column. If starting with HA sample in de-ionized water, add 2 M NaCl to bring the final salt concentration to 0.1 M.Pre-washing and equilibration of the IEX columnsWe found that an unknown (possibly cationic) species may be shed from the columns during sample elution and later cause precipitation of HA following fractionation and dialysis. The IEX column is therefore pre-washed once with 400 µl of 0.1 M NaCl, then 3 times with 400 µl of 0.800 M NaCl, and then re-equilibrated using 5 washes with 400 µl of 0.100 M NaCl before use.Sample loading on columnLoad 400 µl HA sample solution (in 0.1 M NaCl) onto the column and centrifuge at 400 x g for 2-min. Wash through unbound or weakly bound materialWash the column with 400 µl 0.1 M NaCl to fully elute unbound neutral or positively charged contaminants. Then wash the column with 400 µl 0.2 M NaCl three times to remove any weakly bound impurities. Only HA less than ~4 kDa (10 disaccharides long) will elute at this concentration. Fractions collected using 0.2 M NaCl can be analyzed for HA oligomers by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (FACE).HA Fraction ElutionElute HA from low to high molecular mass by increasing NaCl concentration in each elution. For each elution, 2 x washes are needed to completely wash out that HA fraction. Combine the elutions from the same NaCl concentrations for dialysis. HA will be eluted out by NaCl solutions from 0.3 to 0.",

Centrifugal concentration of HA solutions containing salt can cause HA degradation. Alternatively, precipitate HA with 4 vol EtOH."
