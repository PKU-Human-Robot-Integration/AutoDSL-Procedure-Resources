    "TreatmentPlate the cells to be tested in a 150 mm culture dish to obtain 80-90% confluency the following day (do not exceed 4 x 107 cells per labeling reaction). Note: In our study, we used SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with TrkB receptor cultured in RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.3 mg/ml of geneticin, 0.5 µg/ml fungizone, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Ho et al., 2002). The cells were plated at a density of 2 x 106 cells/plate. On the following day, replace the standard cell culture media with media that does not contain serum (serum free media).24 h later treat cells as desired.Note: In our study, we treated the cells with NPY at a concentration of 10-7 M and BDNF at 1 ng/ml for 8 min (Czarnecka et al., 2015). Untreated cells served as a control.  BiotinylationDissolve the contents of 1 vial containing 12 mg of Sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin in 48 ml of ice-cold PBS to obtain a final concentration of 0.25 mg/ml biotin in the biotin-labeling solution.Upon the desired treatment, remove media and wash cells twice with 10 ml of ice-cold PBS per dish. Remove PBS immediately after washing.Note: Do not allow PBS to remain in contact with the cells for more than 5 sec to prevent rounding and detachment of cells.Add 12 ml of biotin-labeling solution to each dish.Place culture dishes on a rocking or orbital shaker and gently agitate for 30 min at 4 °C (cells must be covered with the biotin-labeling solution).Add 600 µl of quenching solution (kept and applied at 4 °C) to each culture plate to quench reaction. Ensure even coverage of the cells by gently tilting the plate and subsequently proceed to the next step.",
    "Gently scrape cells into solution and transfer the contents to corresponding 50 ml conical tubes. Rinse each plate with a single 4 ml volume of ice-cold TBS. Add the cells remaining in the rinse solution to previously collected cells in the 50 ml conical tubes corresponding to the appropriate treatment group.Centrifuge cells at 500 x g for 3 min at 4 °C. Discard supernatant.Add 5 ml of ice-cold TBS and re-suspend cells by gentle pipetting.Centrifuge cells again for 3 min at 4 °C.Discard supernatant.Cell lysisSupplement the desired amount of lysis buffer (number of samples x 370 µl + 10% excess by volume) with protease inhibitor cocktail at a 1:100 ratio.Re-suspend cells in 370 µl of lysis buffer by pipetting and then transfer to a tube that is fitting for the sonication process (in our case 15 ml tube).Sonicate (1.5 power) 5 x 1-sec bursts.Incubate cells for 30 min on ice, and during that period:Vortex every 5 min for 5 sec.Sonicate additionally every 10 min on ice.Transfer clarified supernatant to a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube. At this stage:Measure protein concentration using the Bradford method (Bio-Rad protein assay) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Normalize protein concentrations for all samples and use equal volumes of these normalized lysates for subsequent steps (approx. 400 µl).Note: Our protein of interest is expressed at low levels; therefore we used the highest possible protein concentration, normalized to the least concentrated sample. However, we suggest to adjust the protein amount used in the assay according to the expression level of tested protein based on previous experiments, or to establish the proper concentration in a separate pilot experiment. Set aside 30 µl of each normalized lysate to be run on a gel as a loading control. Use the remaining volume (approx.",
    "370 µl) for the isolation of biotinylated cell surface proteins (step D6 below).Isolation of labeled proteinsInsert a column into a collection tube.Add 350 µl of NeutrAvidin agarose gel to each column and cap the column.Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g, and then discard flow-through (FT).Add 400 µl of wash buffer to the gel.Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g, and then discard FT.Apply bottom cap to each column and add cell lysate to agarose; apply top cap to each column (wrap each cap in parafilm, as shown in Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161011/20161011001359_5497.jpgFigure 1. The sketch of a single column with applied bottom and top caps (in red) wrapped in parafilm (blue) Incubate for 60 min at room temperature, mixing throughout by placing columns on a rotator/rocking platform.Add protease inhibitor cocktail to the desired amount of the wash buffer calculated according to the following formula: number of samples x 4 washing steps x 400 µl + an excess of 10% by volume.Remove bottom caps and place columns in their collection tubes. Centrifuge columns for 1 min at 1,000 x g, and then discard FT.Return columns to collection tubes, remove the top caps and add 400 µl of wash buffer to each column.Apply both caps to columns and mix content by inverting columns.Note: To simplify this step, in place of a bottom cap, a piece of parafilm can be held (a fresh piece needs to be used for each sample in each step).Remove bottom caps and centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g, and then discard FT.Remove top caps.Repeat steps D11-D14 three times.Replace bottom cap on columns.Protein elutionPuncture foil covering one No-weigh DTT microtube with a pipette tip, and add 50 µl of ultrapure water to obtain 1 M DTT.",
    "Prepare the loading buffer by combining the desired volume of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (number of samples x 150 µl + 10% excess by volume) with 1 M DTT solution at a 1:20 ratio to obtain a final concentration of 50 mM DTT.Add 150 µl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing DTT to each column (the resins must be covered), and then cap columns from top and bottom.Incubate columns for 60 min at room temperature on a rocking platform.Note: Alternatively, as mentioned in the original protocol provided in the kit, samples can be heated in a heat block for 5 min at 95 °C. However, it will lead to the recovery of some NeutrAvidin protein monomer (15 kDa) in the eluates.Remove a column’s top cap first, and then the bottom cap; place columns in new collection tubes and apply a top cap.Note: The sequence of caps removal is particularly important in the case of elution at a high temperature (step E4 above), as it prevents eluate leakage from the tubes.Centrifuge for 2 min at 1,000 x g.Analyze eluates and input samples by Western blot (see below). Store samples at -20 °C if not used immediately.Protein separation and target protein identification by Western blotDenature eluates by incubation in boiling water for 2 min. Note: Eluates are already in SDS-PAGE sample buffer used to elute the biotinylated proteins from columns, as described in the ‘Protein elution’ section.In addition, prepare the previously obtained lysates for Western blotting by adding SDS-PAGE loading buffer with reducing agent (50 mM DTT) and denature samples, as described in point 1 above. Separate both fractions (namely, eluates and lysates) on 4-20% Tris-glycine gels and transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane according to the standard procedures.Block the nitrocellulose membrane with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.2% of Tween 20 (TBST).",
    "Blot with the desired primary and secondary antibody to detect the surface receptor of interest. Note: In our study, we used goat polyclonal anti-Y5R antibody diluted at 1:1,000 in 5% milk/TBST followed by donkey anti-goat-horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody diluted at 1:25,000.Develop immunoblots with SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate. Optionally, the more sensitive Femto chemiluminescent substrate can be used if a weak signal is expected."
