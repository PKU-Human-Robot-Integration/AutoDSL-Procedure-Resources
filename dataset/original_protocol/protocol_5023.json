    "Preparation of citrate synthase and maltodextrin glucosidaseCommercially available citrate synthase is supplied in ammonium sulphate suspension to keep the enzyme in an inactive state. The suspension is then pipetted into a fresh microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 15,000 x g, for about 10 min at 4 °C. The enzyme CS is present in a solid state and therefore will be collected in the pellet fraction. Discard the supernatant and dissolve the pellet containing enzyme CS in sterile water at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. The CS should be further purified by size exclusion chromatography and dialysed against 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0). For refolding assays, CS stock solutions at concentration of 150 μM is prepared in TE buffer by concentrating CS using Amicon Ultra microconcentrator with 30 kDa cutoff before use.The expression plasmids pCS19MalZ containing (His)6 tagged coding region of malz gene are transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells and plating is performed on Luria Bertani agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin for selecting pCS19MalZ. A single colony from the transformed bacterial cells grown on Luria Bertani agar plate containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin is picked and grown in the Luria Bertani broth containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin. The tube is incubated for overnight at 37 °C with constant shaking at a rate of 150 rpm. About 2% of the overnight culture is inoculated in fresh Luria Bertani broth containing ampicillin 100 µg/ml and then incubate it for 2 h at 37 °C with constant shaking at a rate of 150 rpm. The expression of MalZ protein is then induced with 100 µM IPTG and left for 12 h. The IPTG induced culture is pelleted through centrifugation at 11,510 x g for 50 min.",
    "The supernatant is discarded, wash the cell pellet with binding buffer and resuspend the cells in binding buffer, along with DNAse I (1 µl/ml of cell lysate), 0.5 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM PMSF (a serine protease inhibitor). The cells are disrupted through sonication on ice, and the supernatant is collected after centrifugation. (Sonication was performed for 5 min at 1 sec on and 2 sec off cycle and at 30% amplitude) The protein is further purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The column is washed with 5 column volumes of washing buffer and the protein is eluted with 5 column volumes of elution buffer (Goyal et al., 2014). Note: Nickel nitrilotriacetic [Ni-NTA] chromatography is used for purification of 6x His-tagged recombinant proteins overproduced in bacteria. The Ni-NTA agarose resins possess high affinity and specificity for 6x His-tagged recombinant fusion proteins. The proteins bound to the resin are eluted by competition with imidazole.The concentration of the protein is determined using Bradford reagent. The standard curve is plotted using different concentration of bovine serum albumin by determining the Optical Density using spectrophotometer and plotting the 595 nm values (y-axis) versus their concentration in µg/ml (x-axis).The concentration of dialyzed protein is then determined using the standard curve.Thermally induced aggregation assay To elucidate the chaperonic function of hRes protein on the thermal aggregation of CS, recombinant GroEL protein is used as a positive control and lysozyme as a negative control. Note: Chaperone to substrate ratio is critical and initially different ratios should be used to determine the optimal ratio for the effect of chaperone activity.We maintained 1:1 ratio between hRes (chaperone) vs. CS (Suragani et al., 2013). The proteins are used at 0.15 µM concentration.",
    "Similarly, to analyze the chaperone function of MoxR1 protein on thermal aggregation of MalZ, GroEL is used as a positive control and lysozyme as a negative control. GroEL and lysozyme are used at 2 µM concentration. In this case, we maintained the initial 12:1 ratio between MoxR1 (chaperone) and MalZ (Bhuwan et al., 2016) (see Note 1). Stirred 0.75 ml quartz cuvettes are to be used in a fluorescence spectrophotometer. The stirring is achieved by removing the cuvettes out of the spectrophotometer and sealing it by Parafilm and mixing the solution by see-saw movement during the time interval of each data point. The emission and excitation slits should be set to 2-5 nm.Pre-equilibrate 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) with and without chaperones at 45-47 °C for 50 min. The chaperone dialysis buffer without chaperones is used as a control which is included in the assay to rule out the possibility of stabilizing effects of buffer. Note: After each sample analysis the quartz cuvettes should be thoroughly washed with a strong jerk using MilliQ water to remove the traces of previous protein samples and any film formed on the side of the cuvettes and after washing, the cuvette should be dried before using it at the next step. The initial light scattering signals are monitored at a constant wavelength of 320 nm for CS and NdeI. Here, the data points should be taken at every 5 min and the kinetics are constantly measured for 45 min at 45 °C. The increase in light scattering is observed to visualize the thermal aggregation of CS. The light scattering signal for MalZ is to be recorded at 500 nm wavelength.",
    "Note: The range of absorbance for dynamic light scattering to detect aggregation is 300 nm to 600 nm and can also be optimized for different chaperone analysis.Take the data at 5 min interval and the kinetics is monitored for 15 min at 47 °C (see Note 2).The signal prior to CS or NdeI and MalZ addition is set to 0 (= no aggregation).The readings are exported in a Microsoft Excel format and graph. Plot the data for Optical Density on x-axis vs. Time on y-axis using Origin or Graphpad Prism 5 software to obtain a graph.The resulting sigmoidal graphs will allow identifying the chaperonic function of a protein by preventing thermal aggregation of CS or NdeI and MalZ."
