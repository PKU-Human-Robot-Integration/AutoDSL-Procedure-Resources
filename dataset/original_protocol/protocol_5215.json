    "Preparations (Day 1)–Coating of wells with collagenDefrost one collagen aliquot for 2 wells of a 6-well plate or an according volume for other well sizes (see Table 1) slowly (2-3 h) on ice in a refrigerator (4 °C)If necessary, defrosting aliquots in the refrigerator without ice is possible.Table 1. Volume adjustment according to well sizeimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170515/20170515010955_3606.jpgDilute collagen to 50 µg/ml with 0.05 N HCl.Note: 0.05 N HCl aliquots can be stored at -20 °C.Vortex thoroughly. At least 10 sec until small bubbles form (turn the tube to ensure that the viscous collagen stock solution does not continuously stick to the bottom).Coat wells evenly with collagen solution (volume see Table 1).Put the plate on a shaker, 1 h at room temperature, 25 rpm.Move the plate to 4 °C for storage (overnight possible).Note: It is also possible to coat the plates on the day of endothelial cell preparation. Isolation (Day 2)Preparations:IceSterilization of instrumentsApprox. 50 ml DPBS in a 150 ml sterile beaker on ice (for each sample).Disinfectant (70% EtOH) in a sterile beaker on ice (approx. 50 ml in 150 ml sterile beaker)Switch on laminar flow and prepare cellulose chromatography paper, tissue grinder, scalpel, tweezers and 50 ml centrifuge tubes (one for each sample).Precool centrifuge to 4 °C.Anesthetize mice according to your local animal regulations. We use an overdose of isoflurane, which leads to breathing arrest within one minute. Decapitate the mouse with a big scissor and dip the head in ethanol (on ice). Remove the brain swiftly (Figure 1A) and store it in DPBS on ice. Repeat for all brains.Cut off cerebellum and olfactory bulb.Remove meninges by rolling the brains on cellulose chromatography paper using blunt tweezers.Cut cerebrum in 2 to 4 pieces and put the pieces in 5 ml working medium (4 °C). Repeat for all brains.",
    "Transfer brains with 5 ml working medium (4 °C) into a tissue grinder (Figure 1E) and homogenize (30 strokes with pistil A, 25 strokes with pistil B, Figure 1F). Use a maximum of 10 brains in one tissue grinder.Transfer homogenate into a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Rinse tissue grinder with 5 ml working medium (4 °C) and add to the homogenate (10 ml altogether).Centrifuge homogenate at 1,350 x g, 5 min, 4 °C. Remove supernatant carefully using a pipette or vacuum pump.Resuspend the pellet in 15 ml dextran solution and vortex extensively (2 min). The result is a white, cloudy, homogenous suspension (Figure 1G).Centrifuge at 6,080 x g, 10 min, 4 °C. In the meantime, supplement digestion medium with 100 µl collagenase/dispase, 40 µl DNase I and 100 µl TLCK each per 10 ml digestion medium. Pre-warm digestion medium to 37 °C.After centrifugation, remove the fluffy myelin layer (top, black arrows in Figures 1H and 1I) and the dextran as completely as possible. Use a 10 ml disposable pipette. Remove the filter of the pipette first if necessary.Resuspend the pellet (white arrows in Figures 1H and 1I) in 10 ml digestion medium (37 °C).Digest the tissue for 1 h 15 min in a 37 °C water bath (shake from time to time for 2 to 3 sec–approx. every 15 min).Centrifuge cell suspension at 1,350 x g, 5 min, room temperature. In the meantime, get the pre-coated plate from the refrigerator, fill sterile DPBS (10 ml per sample) in a centrifuge tube and heat it to 37 °C. Optionally, supplement full medium with puromycin and pre-warm to 37 °C (see step B2q).Remove digestion medium.Resuspend pellet in 10 ml warm DPBS.Centrifuge at 1,350 x g, 5 min, room temperature.",
    "In the meantime, remove collagen from the coated wells and wash twice with DPBS. DPBS from the second wash is left in the wells until cells are ready for seeding.Remove DPBS and resuspend the pellet in full medium. 2.5 ml full medium per well for a 6-well plate. Use 4-6 brains per culture plate.Mix cell suspension carefully before seeding to ensure even distribution.Add puromycin as indicated in Table 2. (Can be added directly to the full medium, see step B2l).Table 2.

Typical images for the preparation of the brain, removal of meninges, homogenization and subsequent dextran gradient centrifugation. The images depict the first steps of the isolation procedure showing the brain in situ after removal of the skullcap (A), before (B. cut planes indicated by dashed line) and after removal of cerebellum, olfactory bulb (C) and the meninges (D). Then, collect the brains in a Dounce tissue grinder (E), homogenize them (F), and centrifuge the tissue homogenate. Next, resuspend the cells in the dextran solution and vortex extensively (G). Following the centrifugation, the resulting myelin layer is at the top while the vessel fragments collect around the edge of the tube bottom (H + I, black arrows: myelin layer, white arrows: pellet location). The size of the vessel fragment pellet depends on the number of brains used. In E-I, two brains were used for the preparation.Day 3Wash cells twice with DPBS.Change full medium.Add puromycin (alternatively, puromycin can be added in advance to the full medium).Day 4Change full medium.Note: No puromycin needed anymore.CultivationChange medium 1-2 times per week, first time approx. 4-6 days after isolation.Split the culture 1:2 (or 1:3) if the cells are confluent. Use trypsin 5-10 min and inactivate with full medium. Plate cells and change medium the next day.",
