    "All patients provided a signed written informed consent and the approval of the local Ethics Committee (EC/2014/0438) was obtained.\nNOTE: The inclusion criteria for the presented protocol were: male; age ≥18 years; signed written informed consent; fit for operation; isolated urethral stricture; urethral stricture ≤3 cm; urethral stricture only at the bulbar or membranous site. The exclusion criteria were: female; transgender; age <18 years; absence of signed written informed consent; unfit for operation; >1 concomitant urethral strictures; urethral stricture >3 cm; urethral stricture outside of the bulbar or membranous site.\n1. Preoperative Work-up\nEvaluate the patient through history taking, physical examination, and uroflowmetry followed by an ultrasonic residual volume measurement.\nConfirm the presence of a stricture by urethrography (retrograde and/ or antegrade). If there is any doubt, additionally perform urethroscopy.\nAfter the appropriate diagnosis, schedule patients with isolated short bulbar urethral strictures or with strictures at the membranous urethra for urethroplasty by vessel-sparing excision and primary anastomosis (vsEPA). Plan the surgery at least 3 months after any urethral manipulation including catheter use, dilation, or direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU). In the case of urinary retention, place a suprapubic catheter to ensure urinary derivation. In the case of pelvic fracture-related urethral injuries, perform urethroplasty at least 3 months after the initial trauma.\nPerform preoperative investigations to evaluate the patient’s fitness for operation as prescribed by local guidelines. If necessary, conduct therapeutic interventions accordingly.",
    "One week before surgery, perform a urine culture with an antibiogram and, in the case of a urinary infection, start the appropriate antibiotics 24 h before surgery. If there is no urinary infection, administer a single shot of 1 g of cefazoline (dissolved in 10 cc of NaCl, 0.9%) intravenously (through the peripheral venous catheter using a 20 cc syringe and an 18 G needle) at the start of the operation.\nObtain routine venous thrombo-embolism prophylaxis by the administration of compression stockings.\nKeep the patients sober at least 6 h before surgery.\n2. Initiation of Surgical Procedure\nNOTE: The following steps take place after the surgical safety checklist and the administration of general anesthesia.\nPatient’s positioning\nPlace the patient on the operating table in a supine position.\nPlace the patient in a modified lithotomy position in which the knees and the hips are flexed 60–90° with 45° of abduction and the feet and calves are supported in supportive boots or leg holders. Make sure the patient’s buttocks slightly pass the caudal border of the operating table to provide sufficient accessibility. Check extensively for areas with excessive compression to prevent neurovascular compression syndromes.\nIf necessary, obtain a 10–15° Trendelenburg position to fully visualize the diseased urethra.\nStart-up of the surgical procedure\nShave and disinfect the exposed perineum and external genitals using an iodine-based scrub as antiseptic.\nIn the case of the presence of a suprapubic catheter, instill the bladder with 100 mL of diluted (10%) iodine-based scrub.\nCreate a sterile operating field by the administration of sterile drapes. Keep the operating field as small as possible and include the penis and scrotum without the anus. In the case of the presence of a suprapubic catheter, include this in the operating field to ensure suprapubic access to the urethra, if necessary.",
    "As the surgeon is seated between the legs of the patient, position an assistant next to him/ her and place the instrumentalist on the left side of the patient, handing over the instruments from above the operating field.\n3. Surgical Procedure\nAccessing the bulbar urethra\nMake a midline perineal skin incision using a scalpel (blade number 24) and dissect the subcutaneous fat tissue through Colles’ fascia with a monopolar electrocauter (coagulation and cutting mode on 25 Watt and pure) until the bulbospongious muscle is encountered. Coagulate any bleeding vessels with the monopolar electrocauter.\nIncise the bulbospongious muscle at the midline using a surgical blade number 24 and dissect it away from the underlying corpus spongiosum with Jones scissors.\nFix the bulbospongious muscle at the perineal skin using 4 silk 2-0 stay sutures and ensure further surgical exposure by a self-retaining retractor: attach the hooks of the elastic stays to the bulbospongious muscle, create sufficient traction, and secure the elastics to one of the slots of the retractor (Figure 1).\nIdentify the bulbar urethra.\nMobilization of the bulbar urethra\nDissect the bulbar urethra circumferentially in a sharp fashion with Jones scissors starting at the mid-bulbar region. Incise Buck’s fascia on each side of the bulbar urethra with Jones scissors allowing a further dorsal dissection of the urethra and a detachment of the dorsal Buck’s fascia from the tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa.\nEncircle the bulbar urethra with a vessel loop and secure it with a Kocher clamp to facilitate manipulation (Figure 2).",
    "First, continue the dorsal dissection and detachment in the distal direction, towards the penoscrotal angle. Use sharp scissors dissection, closely follow Buck’s fascia in this dorsal detachment as it provides a rather avascular surgical plane. Coagulate the communicating vessels between the corpus spongiosum and the corpora cavernosa with a monopolar electrocauter.\nContinue the dorsal dissection proximally, towards the urogenital diaphragm. Do not dissect the bulb of the corpus spongiosum at the anal side and leave the perineal body intact.\nOpening of the stricture\nIntroduce a 20Fr silicone urethral catheter or a 20Fr metal sound in the meatus urethrae and pass it up toward the distal extent of the urethral stricture.\nAt this level, open the urethra dorsally in a longitudinal fashion (dorsal stricturotomy) using a scalpel (blade number 15 or 24).\nPlace 2 silk 3-0 stay sutures (1 on each side of the opened urethra) to facilitate the exposure of the urethral lumen.\nInsert a 3Fr ureteral catheter through the dorsally-opened urethra and pass it up proximally through the strictured area.\nFurther open the stricture on this 3Fr ureteral catheter using Jones scissors or a surgical blade number 15 until healthy urethral tissue is encountered.\nEvaluate the patency and caliber of the proximal urethra by introducing a 20Fr metal sound and move it up toward the bladder.\nPlace 2 silk 3-0 stay sutures (1 on each side) on the opened proximal urethra.\nFor bulbar strictures, resect the stricture as well as the surrounding spongiofibrosis using Jones scissors until healthy spongious tissue is encountered ventrally. Leave this healthy spongious tissue intact.",
    "For strictures at the membranous urethra, fully resect the scar tissue using Jones scissors or a surgical blade number 15 until the apex of the prostate is reached. After the removal of the suprapubic catheter, introduce a cystoscope through the suprapubic tract to facilitate the identification of the prostatic apex.\nUrethral anastomosis\nIf necessary, split the corpora cavernosa to shorten the distance towards the proximal urethra. Use a surgical blade number 15 on the midline between the corpora cavernosa and once the avascular plane between both corpora is encountered, continue with a blunt dissection.\nGrasp the urethral mucosa with a DeBakey forceps with a large grip.\nIn the case of a bulbar stricture\n\t\t\nCreate the ventral urethral plate by suturing the ventral ends of the proximal and distal urethra from the inside of the urethral lumen using interrupted 4-0 sutures (polyglactin 910).\nDorsally, spatulate the healthy urethral edges for about 1 cm using Jones scissors and remove the stay sutures.\nClose the dorsal edges of the urethral ends transversely over a 20Fr silicone urethral catheter with interrupted 4-0 sutures (polyglactin 910).\nClose the corpus spongiosum over the urethra (spongioplasty) using 4-0 sutures (polyglactin 910).\nIn the case of a stricture or obliteration at the membranous urethra\n\t\t\nSpatulate the distal urethral end dorsally and the proximal urethral end ventrally over 1 cm using Jones scissors.\nPlace eight 4-0 sutures (polyglactin 910) and pass a 20Fr silicone urethral catheter into the bladder.\nCatheter drain and wound closure\nLeave a 20Fr silicone urethral catheter in place.\nLeave a 10Fr suction drain behind between the corpus spongiosum and the bulbospongious muscle. Perforate the skin of the right inguinal region with the 10Fr drain needle. Cut the needle off.",
    "Cut the stay sutures with Mayo-Stille scissors, remove the retractor, and close the bulbospongious muscle over the underlying urethra, corpus spongiosum, and suction drain using a 3-0 running suture (polyglactin 910).\nSuture Colles’ fascia in a running fashion, also using a 3-0 suture (polyglactin 910). Suture the skin with interrupted Donati stitches using 3-0 sutures (polyglactin 910).\nFix the suction drain at the groin using a silk 2-0 suture and attach the suction drain to the vacuum flask. Apply a perineal compressive dressing.\nFlip the penis and transurethral catheter toward the lower abdomen and keep them in place by supporting and compressive underwear.\nIf a suprapubic catheter was present, remove this, except in the case of previous irradiation.\n4. Postoperative Care\nAfter recovery, bring the patient to his room and provide standard postoperative care.\nRemove the suction drain after 24 h.\nIn the case of a preoperatively established urinary infection, continue the antibiotic treatment regimen as prescribed.\nDisinfect the perineal wound repeatedly and use a hair dryer 3–5x a day to keep the wound dry and neat.\nIn the case of no major complications, discharge the patient from the hospital on postoperative day 2 with the indwelling transurethral catheter in place. Give further instructions, especially regarding wound care, and foresee an appointment to remove the catheter.\n5. Follow-up Visits\nAfter 7 (simple repair) to 14 days (irradiated cases), perform a voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) and, if there is no or insignificant contrast leakage, remove the transurethral catheter. In the case of significant extravasation, replace the transurethral catheter and perform the VCUG again 1 week later.",
    "Schedule follow-up visits 3 months postoperatively, 12 months postoperatively, and annually thereafter. During these visits, evaluate the patient through history taking, a physical examination, uroflowmetry, and an ultrasonic residual volume measurement. Perform further technical investigations such as retrograde urethrography (RUG), VCUG, or urethroscopy only in the case of arguments for stricture recurrence such as symptoms, an obstructive voiding curve, or high residual urinary volumes.\nDefine surgical failure as stricture recurrence requiring additional urethral manipulation, including dilation.\nSubscription Required.
