    "All animal experiments were conducted in compliance with the University Laboratory Animal Resources under protocols approved by the University of California, Irvine, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The experiments were performed with male B6C3-Tg(APPswe, PSEN1dE9)85Dbo/Mmjax (APP/PS1) mice (13-month-old, n = 35). The mice were obtained from commercial sources (see Table of Materials).\n1. Brain tissue preparation\nAnesthetize the mice using a lethal dose of a phenytoin/pentobarbital-based anesthetic (150 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally (see Table of Materials) following approved animal protocols. Perform cardiac perfusion with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (1x PBS) for 5 min at a speed of 5 mL/min to clear the brain vasculature14.\nHarvest brain tissue following the previously published report15, separate into the left and right brain hemisphere and place the right hemi-brain of each mouse into a 15 mL conical tube containing 5 mL of freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in 1x PBS for 72 h at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: The brains may be immersion-fixed from 24-72 h depending on the antigen being studied. The left hemi-brain, without the cerebellum, can be snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 °C, followed by processing for biochemical assays such as ELISA and biochemical Aβ detection16.\n\tCAUTION: PFA is a probable carcinogen, and skin contact with PFA may lead to allergic skin symptoms. Use nitrile or butyl gloves, masks, and eye protection for handling it, and prepare under a chemical fume hood.\nAfter incubation in 4% PFA, incubate the hemi-brains sequentially in 5 mL of 10%, 20%, and 30% sucrose solutions prepared in 1x PBS for 24 h, each at 4 °C until the brain tissue sinks to the bottom of the conical tube.",
    "After incubation in the 30% sucrose solution, remove the hemi-brain, gently dab the brain on a filter paper to remove the excess sucrose solution, and freeze the fixed hemi-brain in powdered dry ice for 30 min. Store the frozen hemi-brain in well-labeled aluminum foils at -80 °C until cryosectioning.\n\tNOTE: In the current protocol, the hemi-brains were stored at -80 °C for 6-8 months.\nSection the frozen hemi-brain into 20 µm thick sections using a cryostat (see Table of Materials).\n\t​NOTE: For the current protocol, the hemi-brains were sectioned into sagittal sections, and if needed, coronal sections can also be prepared17. Step 2 is for Aβ immunofluorescent staining on fixed and cryoprotected brain tissue samples.\n2. Immunofluorescence\nPlace the sagittal brain tissue sections (step 1.5) into a 24-well plate (up to six mouse brain sections per 300 µL per well). Wash for 5 min with 1x PBS three times at room temperature (23 °C) by placing the plate on a shaker with gentle swirling.\nIncubate the brain tissue sections with 70% formic acid in dH20 at room temperature for 10 min.\n\tCAUTION: Formic acid is corrosive, so avoid skin and eye contact.\nWash the brain tissue sections for 5 min with dH20 three times at room temperature.\nBlock non-specific binding with 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.3% TritonX 100 (see Table of Materials) in 1x PBS at room temperature for 1 h.\nIncubate the brain tissue sections with a fluorophore-labeled primary antibody (6E10, see Table of Materials) diluted (1:1000) in 1x PBS containing 0.3% TritonX 100 at 4 °C for 24 h.\n\tNOTE: Since the primary antibody is fluorophore-conjugated, the plate needs to be covered from this step onward, or all work must be done in a dark room to maintain fluorophore effectiveness.",
    "Wash the brain tissue sections for 10 min with 1x PBS three times at room temperature.\nMount the brain tissue sections onto positively-charged glass slides (see Table of Materials) that are well labeled (label information on the slide is based on preference), after a brief wash with dH20 to remove remaining salts. Let the slides air dry in the dark.\n\tNOTE: The brain sections must be mounted carefully to avoid folds and rips, impacting data quantification. In case of rips and/or folds that lie in the region of interest and can interfere with data quantification, re-staining and re-mounting are recommended.\nMount the brain tissue sections with an aqueous mounting media (see Table of Materials) and place the glass coverslip over the tissue. Seal the ends of the coverslip with clear nail polish and store the slides in a slide box at 4 °C until imaging.\n\t​NOTE: In the current protocol, the slides were imaged within 1 month after staining.\n3. Imaging\nImage the 6E10-stained brain sections using a fluorescence (epifluorescence or confocal) microscope (see Table of Materials), that has a 2x objective to capture the entire brain tissue section in one image and is equipped with the appropriate filter (GFP in this work).\n\tNOTE: Imaging settings must be consistent across different slides.\nSave the captured images as a TIFF file or as required and open them in the image analysis software (see Table of Materials) as described in step 4.2 below for 6E10 quantification.\n\t​NOTE: Include a scale bar before capturing the image to quantify in the image analysis software, ImageJ.\n4. Full-region of interest analysis",
    "NOTE: The present work's two regions of interest are the hippocampus and the iso-cortex. Full-region of interest analysis represents the analysis of the entire iso-cortex (referred to as the cortex going forward) or the hippocampus in the imaged brain tissue section.\nDownload the image analysis software (see Table of Materials) and start the software once installed.\nOnce the software runs, click on File | Open | Choose the image to be analyzed.\nClick on Analyze | Set scale| Click to remove scale. Select the Straight tool from the software tool bar and draw a straight line along the length of the scale bar. Click on Analyze | Measure. Note the length or distance of the scale bar in pixels. Click on Analyze | Set scale.\n\t\nIn the pop-up window, enter the distance in pixels, the known distance of the scale bar (in µm in this case), and the unit of length as µm. Check Global to apply the new scale setting to all following images if multiple images are processed. Click OK to apply the settings.\n\t\tNOTE: It is always recommended to check if the accurate scale is applied to the image before further analysis.\nTo set the desired measurement to the area of the section, go to Analyze | Set measurements | Select the Area and Display Label boxes. Check that the image being analyzed is selected under Redirect to.\nFor ease of hippocampus or cortex visualization, go to Image | Adjust | Brightness/Contrast. Drag the Maximum slide bar gradually to the left to increase tissue clarity until the brain regions of interest are identifiable.\n\tNOTE: Do not apply this setting to avoid false measurements during analysis, instead proceed to the next step.",
    "Use the Polygon selection or Freehand selection tool to outline the hippocampus region. Click on the Reset option of the Brightness/Contrast settings once the hippocampus is outlined to revert to the original brightness.\n\tNOTE: The steps must be repeated separately for the cortical region.\nTo measure the total tissue area of the selected region, click on Edit | Clear outside. Once the selected region is the only image on-screen, click on Analyze | Measure to obtain the total tissue area analyzed in a pop-up window. Save the data in an Excel file for later use.\nTo measure the 6E10-positive area, go to Image | Adjust | Color threshold. A pre-made filter under the Thresholding method usually provides desired results highlighting the strongest signals in red.\n\tNOTE: The optimal threshold selection will depend on the background of the image and the staining intensity. Select a threshold setting that picks up the stain and not the background.\nAfter selecting the appropriate threshold, check Dark background. This will highlight the Aβ spots (the stain of interest) on a black background. Click on Select | Original | Select, giving the dark signals (the Aβ deposits) on a white background. Click on Analyze | Analyze particles and click OK when the pop-up window generates.\nCopy the summary output generated by the software by clicking on Edit | Copy. Paste into the previously started Excel file with respective labels. This is the 6E10-positive area in the selected regions of interest (either hippocampus or cortex).\n\t​NOTE: In Excel, there will be a column for the total 6E10-positive area (step 4.10) and the total tissue area (step 4.7).\nCalculate the 6E10-positive area (%) as follows16: (Total 6E10-positive area/Total tissue area analyzed) x 100.\n5. Sub-region of interest analysis",
    "NOTE: Sub-region of interest analysis represents the analysis of a part of the cortex or the hippocampus in the imaged brain tissue section.\nDownload the image analysis software and start the software once installed.\nOnce the software runs, click on File | Open | Choose the image to be analyzed.\nClick on Analyze | Set scale| Click to remove scale. Select the Straight tool from the software toolbar and draw a straight line along the length of the scale bar. Click on Analyze | Measure. Note the length or distance of the scale bar in pixels. Click on Analyze | Set scale.\n\t\nIn the pop-up window, enter the distance in pixels, the known distance of the scale bar (in µm in this case), and enter the unit of length as µm. Check Global to apply the new scale setting to all following images if multiple images are processed. Click OK to apply the settings.\n\t\tNOTE: It is always recommended to check if the accurate scale is applied to the image before further analysis.\nTo set the desired measurement to the area of the section, go to Analyze | Set measurements | select the Area and Display Label boxes. Check that the image being analyzed is selected under Redirect to.\nAdjust the brightness and contrast if the image is too dim and the brain regions (e.g., the hippocampus or the cortex in this case) cannot be easily identified. Use the software toolbar and click on Image | Adjust | Brightness/Contrast and drag the Maximum sliders to the left as needed to increase the tissue visibility.\n\tNOTE: Do not apply this setting to avoid false measurements during analysis, instead proceed to the next step.",
    "Using the Rectangle tool, select the region of interest in the cortex or the hippocampus. Use the toolbar and click on Edit | Selection | Specify, changing the height and width to a pre-defined value. Adjust the box, so it is completely covered by tissue. Reset the brightness/contrast to revert to the original brightness.\n\tNOTE: The size of the box used to select the regions of interest must be consistent for all the images. For the present analysis, the box size was either 300 pixels x 300 pixels (equivalent to 1177 µm x 1177 µm) or 400 pixels x 200 pixels (equivalent to 1569 µm x 784 µm).\nDuplicate the selected region of interest by right-clicking the box and clicking on Duplicate. A new window with the selected region will open. Rename the duplicated image to display the region it is located in (e.g., cortex or hippocampus).\nAdjust the duplicated image type by using the toolbar and clicking on Image | Type | 8-Bit to convert the duplicated RGB image to 8-bit to best analyze the plaques. Invert the image by clicking on Edit | Invert.\nTo measure the 6E10-positive area, go to Image | Adjust | Threshold. A pre-defined filter under the Thresholding method usually provides the desired results by highlighting the strongest signals in red.\n\tNOTE: The optimal threshold selection will depend on the background of the image and the staining intensity. Select a threshold setting that picks up the stain and not the background.\nAfter selecting the appropriate threshold, select Apply.\nTo analyze the 6E10-positive area, use the toolbar and click on Analyze | Analyze particles, ensuring the \"Summarize Results\" is checked.",
    "Copy the Summary output with the %Area generated by the software by clicking on Edit | Copy. Paste into the previously started Excel file with respective labels.\nRepeat steps 5.3-5.12 for the different regions in the tissue. Ensure the placement of each box to outline the region of interest is consistent between each image.\n\tNOTE: The rotation tool can be utilized if the Rectangle toolbox dimensions cannot fit into the specified region due to tissue curvature.\nTo rotate the rectangle, use the toolbar and click on Edit | Selection | Rotate and adjust the rotation degree as needed. Duplicate the image as mentioned in step 5.7 and clear the outside by using the toolbar and clicking on Edit | Clear outside, which clears the 6E10 stains outside the specified rectangle. Proceed with step 5.8 described above."
