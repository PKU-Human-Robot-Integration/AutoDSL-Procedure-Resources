Upon 6% starch solution injection, macrophages\n      are recruited to the peritoneal cavity and phagocytosed starch granules.\n      After starch induction, 1–2×107 macrophages can be recruited.\n      The proportion of macrophages in the collected peritoneal lavage fluid\n      reaches 80–90%. To clearly distinguish donor and recipient cells,\n      CD45.1+ and CD45.2+ mice are used. By this way, the\n      efficiency of adoptive transfer can be detected by flow cytometry. We used\n      CD45.2+ mice as donor mice and CD45.1+ as recipient\n      mice here. The genotypes of recipient and donor mice can be determined by\n      the experimental design.\n    \n        Intraperitoneally inject CD45.2+ C57BL/6J mice with 0.7–1 mL\n        sterile 6% starch solution.\n      \n3 days later, sacrifice the mice by anesthesia.\nCritical: The number of infiltrating\n      macrophages peaks at 3 days.\n    \n        Soak the mice in 75% alcohol for 3 min and then move them to the\n        ultra-clean workbench.\n      \n        Cut the skin of mice to expose the peritoneum. Use scissors to carefully\n        make a small incision in the center of the peritoneum.\n      \n        Irrigate the peritoneum with 1 mL sterile PBS by sterile dropper. Repeat\n        for 4–5 times until the irrigating solution becomes clear.\n      \nCritical: Irrigate gently to avoid\n      intraperitoneal bleeding.\n    \nNote: The final volume of irrigating\n      solution is about 4 mL. To avoid liquid lost, we recommend gently\n      collecting the lavage against the lateral wall of the peritoneal cavity.\n    \n        Centrifuge the irrigating solution at 500 × g for 5 min.\n        Remove the supernatants.\n      \nNote: If a large number of red blood cells\n      (RBC) exist in the peritoneal lavage fluid, resuspend cell pellets with\n      3 mL mouse RBC lysis buffer. Place on ice for 5 min. Centrifuge at",
    "500 × g for 5 min and then discard the supernatants. Resuspend the\n      pellets with 5 mL PBS. Centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min and discard\n      the supernatants.\n    \n        Suspend the cell pellets using DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and\n        1% penicillin–streptomycin. Adjust the cell density to 2\n        × 106/mL.\n      \n        Seed the cells on the 10 cm cell culture dishes. Place the dishes at\n        37°C under 5% CO2 for 4 h.\n      \n        Discard the supernatants to remove the unattached cells. Wash the dishes\n        with PBS.\n      \n        Add fresh DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1%\n        penicillin–streptomycin. Culture the cells at 37°C with 5% CO2\n        for 24 h.\n      \nNote: Approximately 1 × 107\n      peritoneal macrophages can be collected from a C57BL/6J mouse 3 days after\n      1 mL-starch injection.\n    \nPause point: The donor peritoneal\n      macrophages can be cultured at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 48 h before\n      proceeding to the next step.\n    \n      Macrophage depletion in CD45.1+ recipient mice\n    \nTiming: 48 h\n      This section describes the main procedure to clear macrophages in\n      CD45.1+ recipient mice. Clodronate liposomes are phagocytosed\n      by macrophages and induced apoptosis by blocking mitochondrial respiratory\n      chain, which finally results in the depletion of macrophages. After the\n      depletion of CD45.1+ macrophages, the recipient mice can\n      receive CD45.2+ macrophages, which can be derived from a\n      specific gene knock mouse. Therefore, the function of the donor\n      macrophages can be clearly characterized.\n    \n        Intraperitoneally inject CD45.1+ C57BL/6J mice with 200 μL\n        sterile clodronate liposome.\n      \n        The mice are maintained in a normal chow diet under specific\n        pathogen-free conditions for 2 days.\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2701-Fig2.jpg\n              Figure 2.

Fill a 1 mL syringe with 100 μL cell\n        suspension.\n      \nCritical: The volume of the transfer\n      liquid should not exceed 200 μL.\n    \nNote: To ensure that the cell suspension\n      is homogeneous before injection, step 15 should be done immediately before\n      injection of each mouse.\n    \n        Place a heater around the mice for 10 min to dilate the tail veins.\n      \n        Find the tail veins of CD45.1+ recipient mice.
