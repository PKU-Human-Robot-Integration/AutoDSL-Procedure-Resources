    "This study does not refer to ethical approval and consent to participate. The data used in this study was obtained from gene databases.\n1. Prediction of disease targets\nAccess the GeneCards database (https://www.genecards.org) and online Mendelian inheritance in man database (OMIM, https://www.omim.org), utilizing \"anus eczema\" as the search term for disease targets.\nDownload the spreadsheets of the disease targets. Delete the repeated targets to obtain the anus eczema targets.\n2. Selection of active components\nSearch the keyword \"indigo naturalis, golden cypress, calcined gypsum, calamine, and Chinese Gall\" on the Traditional Chinese Medicine system's pharmacology database (TCMSP; http://tcmspw.com/tcmsp.php) to obtain the list of the candidate active ingredients and targets of SDG.\nEntrust the component onto the Swiss ADME database (http://www.swissadme.ch/index.php), extracting details of those exhibiting \"high\" GI absorption, coupled with at least two \"Yes\" DL values as active elements.\n\tNOTE: Normally, only ingredients with drug-like (DL) values ≥0.18 in the database are included as active ingredients.\n3. Construction of the PPI network and screening of the core proteins\nIn Venny2.1( https://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/index.html), enter the targets of SDG and anus eczema into LIST1 and LIST2, respectively. A visual representation of the intersection is generated instantly. Click on the shared area to reveal the common targets in the Results section.\nAccess the STRING database (https://string-db.org/). Enter the targets in the List of Names field. Then Select Homo sapiens as the Organism and proceed with Search > Continue.\nWhen the results are available, open Advanced Settings and select the hide disconnected nodes in the network. In the Minimum Required Interaction Score, set the highest confidence (0.900) and then click on Update.\nClick on Exports to download the text of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in .png and .tsv format.\n4. Construction of a drug-component-disease-target network",
    "Open Cytoscape 3.9.1 and import the .tsv file mentioned in step 3.4. Click on the Style bar in the control panel to optimize the color, font, and side of the network nodes.\nFor network topology analysis, employ the Analyze Network function. To obtain hub genes, use CytoHubba in Cytoscape software. Establish the drug-component-disease-target network.\n5. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis\nAccess the Metascape website (https://metascape.org/). Select a file or paste a gene list into the dialog box and click the Submit button. Then select H. sapiens in both Input as Species and Analysis as Species; after that, enable the Custom Analysis function.\nIn the enrichment option, select GO Molecular Functions, GO Biological Processes, GO Cellular Components, and the KEGG Pathway database. Check Pick Selective GO Clusters, then click on the Enrichment Analysis button. Upon completion of the progress bar, initiate an Analysis Report Page click to retrieve the enrichment results.\n6. GEO gene chip dataset analysis\nSearch and analyze the GEO gene chip dataset (GDS3806) using the GEO2R tool (https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/) to investigate the expression of central genes in different data groups (control group-non-atopic dermatitis; experimental group-atopic dermatitis).\nEnter the GEO database website (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Input keyword or GEO Accession, and click on the Search button. Select the best matching result. Find the Reference Series (GSE26952).\nEnter the GEO2R tool website (https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/), enter the reference series in the GEO Accession box, and click the Set button. Select Atopic Dermatitis as the experimental group, select Nonatopic Control as the control group, and click the Analyze button. After the calculation is completed, the result will appear.\n7. Molecular docking\nOpen the TCMSP database and download the 3D structure of the selected ingredients. Use the Chemical Name search box and search the selected ingredient names to download the corresponding 3D structure files in mol2 format.",
    "Open the RCSB protein database (http://www.pdb.org/) and download the crystal structures of the key targets. In the search box, search the target names and download the corresponding crystal structure files in pdb format.\nImport ingredients and target structure files into the analysis software. Delete water molecules by clicking on Edit > Delete Water. Add hydrogens by clicking on Edit > Hydrogens > Add. Set the ingredients as the ligand, select whole targets as the receptor, and perform blind docking.\nDetermine the range of molecular docking.\n\t\nSelect the receptor and ligand in sequence. Click on Grid > Grid Box to adjust the grid box to include the entire model. Click on File > Close saving current to save the grid box status. Save files in gpf format.\nClick on Run > Run Autogrid4 > Parameter Filename > Browse, select the gpf file, then click the Launch button.\nUse AutoDock 4 to perform molecular docking.\n\t\nClick on Docking > Macromolecule > Set Rigid Filename to select the receptor. Click on Docking > Ligand > Open/ Choose to select the ligand.\nClick on Docking > Search Parameters to set operation algorithms and Docking > Docking Parameters to set docking parameters. Select the dpf file, then click the Launch button. Save files in the dpf format.\nClick on Analyze > Docking > Open, select the dlg file, click on Analyze > Macromolecule to open the receptor, click on Analyze > Conformations > Play, Ranked by Energy to analyze the results. Click Set Play > Write Complex to save the results in pdbqt format.\nImport the docking files into PyMOL software to construct further visualization.",
    "Select the ligand, and click on Action > Find > Polar Contacts > To Other Atoms in Object to display hydrogen bonds between ligands and the external environment. Click on c to change color.\nClick on Action > Extract Object. Click on Show > Sticks to show the stick structure of the receptor. Identify the residues connected to ligands and show the stick structure.\nClick on Hide > Sticks to hide the stick structure of the receptor. Click on Wizard > Measurement and click on two atoms in sequence. Click on Label > Residue to show the label of the residues. Adjust the background color and transparency if necessary. Click on File > Export Image as to save the picture.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
