    "All animal procedures described below were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Greater Los Angeles VA Healthcare system and were performed under sterile and pathogen-free conditions.\n1. Preparation of Luciferase-expressing 8226 Cells (8226-LUC)\nMaintain the human MM cell line, 8226, in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% carbon dioxide (CO2).\nGenerate stable LUC-expressing reporter 8226 cells by transfecting 1 x 106 8226 cells with a luciferase reporter vector followed by a selection with hygromycin (100 - 350 mg/mL) as previously described6.\nMaintain the cells under standard sterile culturing conditions for 2 - 3 weeks, changing the medium every other day, until the establishment of a stably transfected 8226 cell line has been generated.\nConfirm the in vitro luciferase activity in 1 x 106 transfected cells/100 µL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) by adding the luciferase substrate, D-luciferin (150 µg/mL working solution in prewarmed culture medium), and measuring the bioluminescence of the cells in a test tube or 96-well plate using a luminometer6.\n2. Orthotopic Xenograft Model\nMaintain NOG mice (4 - 6 weeks old, male or female) under sterile/pathogen-free conditions in an appropriate animal care facility.\nPrepare the 8226 LUC-transfected cells for IV injection into the NOG mice (~5 x 106 cells/mouse) on the day of the experiment. Wash the cells 3x in ice-cold PBS, count them, and resuspend them in ice-cold PBS (minus antibiotics and FBS) at a final concentration of 5 x 106 cells/200 µL of PBS) in a sterile test tube. Keep the cells on ice and challenge the mice as soon as possible (within 30 - 120 min).",
    "Anesthetize the mouse (with isoflurane, 1% - 3% in air at 0.5 - 1 L/min) and place the animal in a supine position on a heating pad with the head facing away. Check the level of anesthetization by pinching the toe. Apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes.\nInject the 8226-LUC cells into the mice through the tail vein (200 µL/injection) using a 1 mL insulin syringe and a 26-G needle.\n\tNote: A heat lamp can be used to warm the tail, thereby dilating the vein and increasing the efficacy of injections.\nReturn the animal to their home cage and monitor the animals until they have fully recovered.\nConfirm the engraftment of 8226-LUC cells in the mouse skeleton by measuring the BLI in anesthetized mice (described below and shown in Figure 1A).\n\tNote: BM exudates can also be stained for human CD45 expression using flow cytometry (Figure 1B) or by the immunohistochemistry of harvested bone (Figure 1C).\n3. Measurement of BLI In Vivo\nNote: Typically, measurable BLI from engrafted tumors in mice can be observed first between 10 - 20 days postchallenge, but this may need to be experimentally determined.\nAnesthetize the mouse (with isoflurane, 1% - 3% in air at 0.5 - 1 L/min) and check the level of anesthetization by pinching the toe. Apply ophthalmic ointment to its eyes.\nGive the animal an IP injection (200 µL/injection) of “in vivo-grade” D-luciferin substrate (30 mg/mL diluted in sterile saline).\nMeasure the BLI within 5 - 10 min, following the injection of the luciferin substrate (although the BLI activity can be observable in the mice for up to 45 - 60 min), by placing the anesthetized animal in a supine position in a small-animal imaging system (Figure 2). Select luminescent and X-ray analysis and acquire images (Figure 3).",
    "Measure the average radiance (photons/s/cm2/steradian) in selected regions of interest (ROIs) using imaging software (Figure 4).\nReturn the animal to its home cage and monitor it until it has fully recovered (approximately 15 - 20 min).\n4. Treatment of the Mice with Targeted Therapy\nMeasure the baseline BLI and randomize the animals into treatment groups (4 - 8 mice/group).\nTreat the mice with an IP injection (200 µL/injection) of temsirolimus (0.2 - 40 mg/kg mouse) using a regimen of five daily IP injections followed by 2 days of rest and an additional five daily injections11.\nMeasure the luciferase activity (photons/s/cm2/steradian) 2x per week as described in section 3 and plot the change of the BLI over time. Changes in tumor BLI can be presented as serial images of the mice (Figure 5B).\n\tNote: It is recommended that daily monitoring of the animals be performed until they present the following symptoms (typically within 45 - 60 days of the initial challenge): weight loss (loss of more than 10% relative to the weight prior to implantation) and/or hind limb paralysis, at which time they should be euthanized using a CO2 chamber followed by cervical dislocation.\n5. PET/CT Analysis Using 18F-FDG to Measure Changes in Tumor Metabolism\nFast the animals in their home cage by removing their food for 24 h prior to the experiment to avoid excess non-specific uptake of 18F-FDG.\nPrepare 18F-radiolabeled FDG PET probes (50 - 100 µCi/injection in sterile saline) on the day of the experiment. Record the time and activity of the 18F-FDG probe with a dose calibrator.\n\tNote: Because 18F has a relatively short half-life (~2 h), a careful preparation and planning for the use of these probes must be established.",
    "Anesthetize the animal (with isoflurane, 1% - 3% in air at 0.5 - 1 L/min) and place it in a supine position on a heating pad with the head facing away. Check the level of anesthetization by pinching the toe. Apply ophthalmic ointment to its eyes.\nInject the probe via the tail vein (100 µL/injection) using a shielded 1 mL insulin syringe and a 26-G needle.\n\tNote: A heat lamp can be used to warm the tail, thereby dilating the vein and increasing the efficacy of injections.\nMeasure the residual radioactivity in the needle/syringe in a dose calibrator and note the activity and time.\n\tNote: The standardization of mouse incubation, dosage, and timing is essential to ensure data reproducibility and comparability.\nMaintain the mice under anesthesia and at 37 °C using a heating pad during the whole period of probe uptake (~45 - 90 min).\n\tNote: It is important that the mice remain quiescent and at 37 °C to avoid non-specific uptake of the probe.\nStagger the injections of the 18F-FDG probe to occur at approximately 20- to 30-min intervals to ensure similar labeling times in the mice.\n\tNote: Proper workflow and timing of the probe injections will result in optimal and reproducible imaging conditions.\nMeasure the 18F-FDG activity in a PET/CT small-animal imaging system in selected regions of interest that correspond to the engrafted tumors (Figure 6).\n\tNote: Initially, a 10-min static PET exposure and a 2-min CT exposure are recommended, but the exact exposure times may need to be experimentally determined.\nReturn the animals to their home cages and monitor them until fully recovered. House the mice in a dedicated return room for 24 h while the probe decays to background levels.",
    "Note: Because of the short half-life of 18F, multiple measurements using a fresh probe can be made as frequently as 2x per week.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
