    "This procedure was in accordance with the Regulations of Experimental Animal Administration issued by the State Committee of Science and Technology of China on Oct. 31, 198811. Scientists should follow the guidelines established and approved by their institutional and national animal regulatory organizations.\nNOTE: Animal and regents: Four-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-350 g) were supplied for this experiment. All rats were housed in groups (four or five per cage) at a temperature of 23 ± 1 °C with a 12-h light-dark cycle. Food and water were available ad libitum. The rats were acclimatized to the housing conditions for 7 days before the procedure was performed. Aβ25-35 was dissolved in 1% DMSO saline to 1 mg/mL, and sonicated for 5 min in an ultrasonic oscillator until completely dissolved. AlCl3 and RHTGF-β1 were dissolved in saline at 1% and 0.1 mg/mL, respectively. Congo red, silver nitrate, and other chemicals were of analytical grade and were purchased from ordinary commercial sources.\n1. Surgical Procedure\nNote: 20 male Sprague-Dawley rats were microinjected with composited Aβ into the lateral ventricle and anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, and designated as the composited Aβ-treated group. Another 20 rats were subjected to the same operation but received 0.1% DMSO saline microinjection, and designated as the sham-operated group.\nAnaesthetize the rats with 100% isoflurane by inhalation and then restrain on a Brain Stereotaxic Apparatus.\nShave the fur on the vertex of the head with surgical scissors and disinfect with iodophor. Then, cover disposable surgical towel on the head.\nMake an incision on the head skin along the median longitudinal calvaria with surgical bistouries and scissors.\nSeparate the subcutaneous tissue and fascia, wipe the skull calvarium with a sterile dry cotton for stopping the bleeding, and mark the bregma with a marker pen.",
    "Refer to the Rat Brain Stereotaxic Map12; considering the bregma as the point of origin, mark the three points, the anterodorsal thalamic nucleus (ad) (posterior (P): 2.0 mm to the bregma; lateral (L): 1.4 mm to the midline) for injecting RHTGF-β1 and fixing one screw, the lateral ventricle (LV) area (posterior (P): 0.8 mm to the bregma; lateral (L): 2.0 mm to the midline) for injecting Aβ25-35 and AlCl3, and the second screw fixing place (Front (F): 2.0 mm to the bregma; lateral (L): 1.5 mm to the midline).\nGently drill three 1 mm diameter holes with a flexible bone drill, designated at the above three points of skull (1.5. step). Do not screw deeper than necessary to avoid stabbing the brain tissue.\nStop the bleeding and clean the skull surface repeatedly with sterile dry cotton.\nInsert a needle linked to the micro-injection pump, to the brain at 4.6 mm depth and gently inject 1 μL RHTGF-β1 (10 ng) into the ad area. Stay needle 2 min after injection and slowly pull out the needle (Supplemental File 1).\nFix the two screws into the skull, designated in the points of ad and the second screw fixing place of skull (which were designated at 1.5. step) with a small screwdriver. Do not screw deeper than necessary to avoid stabbing the brain tissue.\nAssemble the cannula implantation system (Supplemental File 2), Insert the dummy cannula into the guide cannula after disinfection by high pressure.\nInsert the stainless-steel tubing guide cannula to the brain at 4.6 mm into LV area through the skull hole (Supplemental File 3), with the help of cannula holder of rats’ stereotaxic apparatus.",
    "Mix the denture base material with denture base water at ratio of 1.5 g per 1 mL, put the paste to cover the guide cannula plastic pedestal and two screws for immobilizing the guide cannula and till cover the whole skin incision for avoiding the skin infection.\nOn day 2 of the operation, anaesthetize the rats with isoflurane inhalation using the Small Animal Anesthesia Machine. Draw out the dummy cannula, insert the internal cannula into the guide cannula, and screw the fixing screw to immobilize the internal cannula.\nSet the polyethylene pipe that links the microinjection pump to the internal cannula and regulate the injection speed to 1 μL/min. Microinject the Aβ25-35 or AlCl3 to the LV.\nMicroinject 4 μg (1 μL) Aβ25-35 daily for 14 days in the morning and 3 μL AlCl3 (1%) daily for 5 days in the afternoon under isoflurane anesthesia.\nWait 5 min after finishing the injection, gently draw out the internal cannula and insert the dummy cannula again into the guide cannula.   \nOn day 15 post surgery (which corresponds to the last injection day of Aβ25-35) dismantle the cannula implantation system. Gently remove the denture base material solid with surgical scissors and forceps, unscrew the two screws, pull out the guide cannula, and disinfect the wound with betadine. Fill in the hole of the skull with bone cement and suture the skin with a simple interrupted suture method.\nPerform the same operation with the sham-operated group and microinject 0.1% DMSO saline.  \nPostoperative nursing\nHouse 2 rats per cage after operation and provide food for 30 days.\n\t\tNote: 18 rats in the sham-operated group survived (90% success rate of operation), and 19 rats in the composited-treated Aβ group survived (95% success rate of operation).",
    "2. Screening for Successful Model Rats and Assessment of Spatial Memory with Morris Water Maze\nMorris water maze\n\tNote: The Morris water maze was used to assess rat spatial memory13. The Morris water maze is a stainless-steel circular tank with 120 cm diameter and 50 cm depth. The water maze test was performed, based on the \"gold standards\" paradigm described in Behavioral Neuroscience by J. Nunez14.\n\t\nBlacken the pool water with several drops of food coloring.\nMaintain the depth of water at 31.5 cm and the temperature at 23 ± 1 °C.\nSet a 1.5 cm circular transparent plexiglass platform below the water surface.\nMaintain that all spatial signals around the water maze are invariable during the water maze tests.\nDivide the pool into 4 equal quadrants by imaginary lines for descriptive data collection.\nPlace the hidden platform in the first quadrant (Q1) of water maze.\nCapture the rat swimming behaviors (measured by latency, trajectory, or crossing number) through a video camera, over the water maze linked to a computer-based graphics analytic software.\nScreening for successful model rats to the composited Aβ-treated group\nOn day 45 of surgery, perform the Morris water maze training for 4 consecutive days to screen for successful model rats with memory impairment and collect the screening ratio (SR).\n\t\tNote: The SR is defined as the average latency of each composited Aβ-treated rat and the sham-operated group of rats to find the hidden platform under the water surface on day 4 of water maze training. “A” is the average latency of each composited Aβ-treated rat to find the hidden platform and “B” is the average latency of the sham-operated group of rats to find the hidden platform, on day 4 of water maze training, in the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56157/56157eq1.jpg",
    "When SR was larger than 0.2 for one composited Aβ-treated rat, the rat was regarded as a successful model rat with impaired memory of composited Aβ-treated rat15. The intraday memory performance was calculated to the data of 2 trials by the average value of rats to find the hidden platform. The process of the Morris water maze test was designed such that the rats were permitted to swim in the water maze tank and search for the hidden platform within 60 s. If a rat did not find out the hidden platform within 60 s, then the rat was put on the platform with hand of experimenter. When a rat reached on the hidden platform (independently or assisted), the rat was let stay there for 20 s. Then, the rat was removed from the tank and allowed a physical recovery for 10 s between the 2 trials.\n3. Neuron examination\nOn day 86 post surgery, under isoflurane anesthesia, euthanize the rats by decapitation (Figure 1).\nPut the brain on ice and gently separate the two hemispheres at the raphe. Take the left hemisphere of the optic chiasma and fix in 4% formaldehyde for light microcopy observation of neuron hematoxylin and eosin (HE), Congo red, or silver nitrate stain (see Sections 4-6). Fix the right hemisphere hippocampus CA1 area in 2.5% glutaraldehyde for electron microcopy observation (Section 7).\nProcess the brain for the light/electron microcopy sample preparation, as previously described16,17.\n4. Neuron HE Staining\nDeparaffinize each slide (20 min each) with gradient alcohol (100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, and 70% alcohol) to distilled water in a fume hood.\nStain for 3 min with hematoxylin (0.5% w/v), and then rinse with tap water to remove the unbound dye from slides.",
    "Rinse with 0.1% hydrochloric acid in alcohol for 1 s to remove the color of unstained nuclei.\nImmerse in 0.5% ammonia solution for 2 min until the background turns light blue.\nStain for 1 min with 1% eosin.\nDehydrate for 5 min with gradient alcohol (70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, and 100% alcohol).\nClear in xylene and mount with resinous mounting medium.\nObserve and count the living neurons of the HE stain per 0.125 mm in the middle CA1 of the hippocampus and per 0.0352 mm2 in the cerebral cortex at a magnification of 400x with an optical microscope by a person blinded to the experimental design.\n5. Congo Red Staining for Assaying Neuron Aβ Burden\nDeparaffinize each slide (20 min) with gradient alcohol (100%, 95%, 90%, 80%, and 70% alcohol) to distilled water in a fume hood.\nStain for 20 min with Congo red working solution (0.5 g Congo red, 80 mL methyl alcohol, 20 mL glycerinum).\nRinse in distilled water for 5 min.\nDifferentiate quickly with alkaline 80% alcohol solution (0.2 g alcohol/100 mL potassium hydroxide) for 3 s.\nRinse twice, each for 5 min with distilled water.\nCounterstain in Gill's hematoxylin for 3 min.\nRinse in tap water for 2 min.\nDip in ammonia water (add a few drops of ammonium hydroxide to tap water and mix well) for 30 s or until the sections turn blue.\nRinse in tap water for 5 min.\nDehydrate with gradient alcohol (70%, 80%, 90%, 95%, and 100% alcohol).\nClear in xylene and mount with resinous mounting medium.\nObserve and count the cells stained with Congo red at a magnification of 400x, with an optical microscope by a person blinded to the experimental design.\n6.
