    "All mice used in the study were maintained and housed in the vivarium of the La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI) under specific pathogen-free conditions with controlled temperature and humidity. Animal experiments were performed with 8-14 weeks old female C57BL/6 mice according to guidelines and protocols approved by the LJI Animal Care Committee.\n1. Preparation of cultured tumor cells for implantation\nCulture B16-F10 melanoma cells in Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 mM MEM nonessential amino acids, and 100 U/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin. Maintain the cell line at 37 °C under 5% CO2.\nSeed 1.5-2 x 106 B16-F10 cells in a 175T flask and culture for 2 days. Harvest cells when they are 75%-80% confluent.\nRemove the culture medium and wash the flask once with PBS. Aspirate PBS and add 5 mL of 0.25% trypsin-EDTA followed by harshly tapping the rim of the culture flask.\nAdd 15 mL of culture medium to neutralize the trypsin-EDTA and pour the contents of the flask into a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Wash the dish surface with 10 mL of PBS and pour into the same 50 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cells for 5 min at 200 x g. Discard the supernatant and break the cell pellet by finger tapping the bottom of the tube.\nAdd cold 10 mL of PBS and gently pipet the cell suspension; then, manually count cells using hemocytometer. Keep the cells on ice before injection.\n2. Tumor implantation",
    "Gas anesthetize mice with 5% isoflurane at gas flow rate of 1.0 L per min in the fume hood. Change the flow rate to the maintenance dose of 2% isoflurane once the mice are fully anesthetized. For this protocol, anesthetization was performed by the veterinarian following the institutional animal care and use guidelines.\nShave the hair on the left flank of the mice and sterilize the injection site using alcohol wipes. Intradermally (i.d.) implant B16-F10 tumor cells at 5 x 105 cells in 50 µL of cold PBS in the left flank using a 30 G needle.\n\tNOTE: The dose of implanted B16-F10 tumor cells may need to be adjusted in the range of 0.5-5 x 105 cells for successful tumor development.\nAfter implantation, measure the tumor length and width three times a week using an electronic digital caliper. Calculate the tumor volume (mm3) using the formula:\nTumor volume (mm3) = width2 × length × 0.5\n\tTreat mice with tumor vaccine when tumors have reached a size of ≥2 mm.\n\t​NOTE: Tumors usually can be measured on day 3 after implantation of 5 x 105 tumor cells. Faster B16-F10 tumor growth rate was observed in male C57BL/6, Rag1-/-, or Rag2-/-γc-/-mice. A similar observation was described in other studies8. Keeping the gender of the mice consistent is recommended. However, note that the NIH places emphasis on sex as an important biological variable in biomedical research.\n3. Vaccine preparation and injection of Flt3L-expressing B16-F10 (B16-Flt3L) cells\nMaintain the B16-Flt3L cells in DMEM containing 8% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and 100 U/mL each of penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2.",
    "Seed 1 x 106 B16-Flt3L cells in a 175T flask and culture for 2 days. Harvest cells when they are 75%-80% confluent as described in steps 1.3 to 1.6 and suspend in 1 mL of cold PBS.\nIrradiate cells at 150 Gy dose of gamma rays using X-ray Irradiator with 160 kV and 25 mA parameter setting. Count and check the cell viability by trypan blue staining before injection.\nGas anesthetize mice as described earlier and sterilize the injection site using alcohol wipes. Intradermally inject the mice with 1 x 106 irradiated B16-Flt3L cells in 50 µL of cold PBS on the same flank as the original tumor implantation, ~1 cm away from the site of the primary tumor on days 3, 6, and 9 after the initial cell implantation.\nMark the vaccine injection sites with a colored pen to distinguish it from the primary tumor.\n\t​NOTE: If 0.5 x 105 B16-F10 cells are initially implanted, it is recommended to perform vaccine treatment on days 8, 11, and 14.\n4. Intratumoral immune cell isolation\nSacrifice mice using CO2 and cervical dislocation in the fume hood at the end of the experiment (on day 15 after tumor implantation; Figure 1).\nSurgically remove the tumor with the skin from each mouse and put it into 24-well plate with 1 mL 10% FBS/RPMI-1640 medium. Dry the tumors using a paper towel before weighing it.\nCut the tumors into small pieces. Add 2 mL of digestion buffer (100 µg/mL TL Liberase and 200 µg/mL DNase I in RPMI-1640 medium) and incubate for 25 min at 37 °C.",
    "Add 10 mL of 10% FBS/RPMI-1640 medium to stop the digestion. Transfer the cells using a 25 mL serological pipette and use the plunger of a 1 mL syringe to grind tissue on a 40 µm cell strainer.\nCentrifuge the cells at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of 40% density gradient specific medium in PBS, diluted to 1x concentration).\nAdd the cell suspension slowly on top of 5 mL of 80% density-gradient-specific medium containing PBS. Centrifuge the cells at 325 x g with low brake setting for 23 min at room temperature (RT).\nAfter centrifugation, carefully collect the leukocytes layer at the interface between 40% and 80% density-gradient-specific medium and pass it through a 40 µm cell strainer. Centrifuge the cells at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nIncubate the pellet in 2 mL of red blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer for 5 min at RT. After incubation, add 10 mL of 10% FBS/RPMI-1640 medium to quench the RBC lysis buffer.\nCentrifuge the cells at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Resuspend the cells in 0.5 mL of 10% FBS/RPMI-1640 medium and count the total number of cells before use for further analysis.\n\t​NOTE: Collect the spleen or dLN as controls for gating strategy of immune cell subsets by flow cytometry analysis. Follow the cell isolation method as described above with the following changes: Use the plunger of a 1 mL syringe to grind tissue on a 70 µm mesh filter. Wash the tissue with 10% FBS/RPMI-1640 medium to get single-cell suspensions. Lyse the RBC as described.\n5. Flow cytometry analysis\nNOTE: Cells collected from the leukocytes layer contain immune cells and tumor cells. Two independent staining panels are recommended.\nSurface staining",
    "Transfer the cells into a 96-well V-shape-bottom plate. Wash the cells with PBS and stain them with cell viability dye (50-100 µL/well) for 15 min at RT.\nCentrifuge the cells at 500 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Stain the surface markers with mixed antibodies (detailed dilution is provided in Table of Materials) in FACS buffer (1% FBS and 0.05% NaN3 in PBS) for 30 min on ice (50-100 µL/ well).\nCentrifuge the cells at 500 x g for 5 min and wash them with FACS buffer twice.\nFix the cells with cell fixation buffer (50-100 µL/ well) for 35 min on ice. Centrifuge the cells at 500 x g for 5 min and wash them twice with FACS buffer.\nStore the samples in FACS buffer (150-200 µL/tube) at 4 °C and protect from light. Acquire the samples on a flow cytometer. For DCs and T cells population, follow the gating strategies provided in Figure 2B and Figure 3A.\n\t\tNOTE: For the staining of myeloid DCs, incubating FC-blocker (Rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32) for 15 min on ice before surface antibodies incubation (step 5.1.2) is recommended.\nCytokine analysis upon ex vivo re-stimulation\n\t\nPlate the cells in complete medium (RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.2-7.6, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acid, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 U/mL each penicillin and streptomycin, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mM L-glutamine) and stimulate with 50 ng/mL of PMA plus 1 µM ionomycin in the presence of protein transport inhibitor for 4 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2.\nPerform surface staining for surface markers as described above in step 5.1.",
    "Add the permeabilization solution (50-100 µL/well) and incubate for 5 min at RT for intracellular staining. Incubate the cells with antibodies specific for cytokines or nuclear proteins in permeabilization solution (50-100 µL/well) for 60 min on ice or overnight at 4 °C.\nCentrifuge the cells at 500 x g for 5 min and wash them with FACS buffer twice. Store the samples at 4 °C and protect from light. Acquire the samples on a flow cytometer.\n\t\tNOTE: Antibody dilution may have to be adjusted as necessary to accomplish optimal staining.\nSubscription Required.
