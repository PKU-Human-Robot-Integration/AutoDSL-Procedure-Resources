    "1. Transgene Subcloning\nChoose an appropriate restriction enzyme recognition site (or sites) in the MCS of pEUI(+), and subclone the gene of interest in the desired direction (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The EGFP or FLAG epitope-tagged ankyrin repeat domain 13A (ANKRD13A) transgene was subcloned in EcoRI site of the pEUI(+) vector using T4 DNA polymerase in a sequence- and ligation-independent cloning method19.\nLinearize the pEUI(+) with EcoRI for 1 h at 37 °C. Mix 50 ng/µL of linearized pEUI(+) with 40 ng/µL of PCR-amplified EGFP or ANKRD13A, and react with T4 DNA polymerase (1 U) for 1 min at room temperature (RT) before incubation on ice for 10 min. Add 10 µL of the reaction mixture directly to 100 µL of DH10B competent cells for the following transformation experiment.\n\tNOTE: Although several restriction enzyme recognition sites were added to the MCS of pEUI(+) (Figure 1B), we recommend subcloning the target gene into the EcoRI site, using ligation-independent cloning technology19,20.\nVerify the insert by sequencing and then purify the DNA using a DNA purification kit that is suitable for transfection.\n2. Transient Transfection and Teb Treatment\nPrepare four cell culture dishes (60 mm diameter) containing freshly passaged HEK293 cells in 5 mL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5 - 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin). Hereafter, \"cell culture medium\" or simply \"culture medium\" represents the DMEM supplemented with FBS and antibiotics. Maintain the HEK293 cells at 37 °C.",
    "Transfect 1 µg of purified DNA into the HEK293 cells at 50 - 60% density using 3 µL of transfection reagent. Add the transfection reagent to 200 µL of diluent (DMEM without FBS and antibiotics) containing the DNA. After the incubation of the reaction mixture for 30 min at RT, add the mixture to the HEK-293 cells on the culture dish. Use two dishes for transfection, and leave the other two untreated as controls.\nAfter 12 - 24 h of transfection, add Teb (final concentrations, 0.2 - 10 µmol) to one of the transfected samples and to one of the non-transfected controls. Leave the other two samples untreated as experimental controls.\n\tNOTE: The Teb stock solution (50 mM dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide) can be diluted in cell culture medium, DMEM, or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at an appropriate concentration before adding to the cultured cells depending on the experimental parameters. However, due to the low solubility of Teb in aqueous solution, avoid preparing a master mix with a high concentration of Teb in medium; instead, replace the complete cell culture medium with fresh medium containing Teb at the desired concentration.\nCultivate the Teb-treated and untreated cells for 12 - 48 h at 37 °C.\nIf using the EGFP insert, analyze EGFP expression under a fluorescent microscope ( Figure 2). Otherwise, harvest the cells for an immunoblotting assay.\n\t\nFor the immunoblotting assay, rinse the cells twice with ice-cold PBS and then scrape them out using a cell scraper.\nFor piling the cells, spin down the harvests in a 15 mL conical tube at 21,000 x g for 2 min at 18-25 °C (RT).",
    "After discarding the PBS completely, add 0.5 mL of ice-cold mammalian protein extraction reagent (M-PER), together with protease inhibitor (5 µL of 100x protease inhibitor cocktail), to the pellet if the cells are cultured in a 60 mm dish.\nRe-suspend the cells with several rounds of pipetting, and then incubate the suspended cells for 15 min at 18 - 25 °C (RT).\nSpin the cell lysate at 21,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.\nTransfer the aqueous supernatant into a fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nAnalyze the supernatant by immunoblotting, following standard protocols with appropriate antibodies.\n3. Generation of Stable HEK293 Cell Lines with Genomic Integration of the pEUI(+) Gene Switch\nTransfect 5 - 10 µg of the purified pEUI(+) with the transgene into HEK293 cells that are 50 - 60% confluent in a 90 mm diameter cell culture dish, using 15 - 30 µL of the transfection reagent. Add the transfection reagent to 500 µL of diluent (DMEM without FBS and antibiotics) containing the DNA. After the incubation of the reaction mixture for 30 min at RT, add the mixture to HEK-293 cells on the culture dish.\nAfter the transfection, allow the transfectants to grow and express the puromycin-resistance gene products under non-selective culture medium (without puromycin) for 24 - 48 h at 37 °C.\nDissociate the cells from the culture dishes by trypsinization. After discarding the culture medium, rinse the transfectants with pre-warmed PBS (37 °C), add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and incubate for 1 min at 37 °C. After quenching the trypsin/EDTA by adding pre-warmed culture medium (10 mL, 37 °C), harvest the cells using a cell scraper, followed by centrifugation in a 15 mL conical tube at 21,000 x g for 2 min at 18-25°C.",
    "Re-suspend the transfectants in 50 mL of pre-warmed culture medium (37 °C), and transfer 10 mL of the cells into 90 mm fresh cell culture dishes. Culture the cells at 37 °C until 50 - 60% confluency before the puromycin treatment (in general, this takes approximately 24 - 48 h).\nCultivate the transfectants at 37 °C in cell culture medium supplemented with 3 µg/mL puromycin for 3 - 4 weeks. During the selection period, change the cell culture medium containing puromycin (3 µg/mL) every 2 - 3 days to maintain selection pressure. When the cells become fully confluent, split them following the procedures in steps 3.3 - 3.4, with puromycin-containing culture medium. Discard the remaining cells in the culture medium, if not needed.\n\tNOTE: Puromycin selection conditions must be established experimentally for specific cell types. We used 3 µg/mL of puromycin in cell culture medium; this was enough to induce cell death in non-transfected HEK293.\nHarvest the cells from individual colonies, using a cloning cylinder, and follow the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\nDiscard the cell culture medium. Rinse the plate twice with pre-warmed (37 °C) PBS to remove floating cells.\nUsing sterile forceps, set the cloning cylinder over the individual colonies.\nAdd 0.2 mL of 0.35% trypsin/EDTA to each cylinder.\nIncubate the dish at 37 °C for 1 min until the cells are detached, and then add a few drops of pre-warmed (37 °C) culture medium to the cylinders.\nTransfer the cells from each cylinder to individual wells of a 6-well plate, with 2 mL of culture medium and 1 µg/mL of puromycin in each well.\n\t\tNOTE: When the cells become confluent, scale up the culture. Now clone(s) may be established.\nMaintain individual clones in cell culture medium supplemented with 1 µg/mL of puromycin.",
    "Validate individual colonies by testing their sensitivity to Teb treatment (final concentration, 10 µM) for 24 h. Test the responsiveness of the clones to the Teb by analyzing the expression level of the transgene with immunoblotting. Select a desired clone (or clones). Cultivate a Teb-treated and an untreated sample in culture medium for 12 - 48 h at 37 °C before analyzing the induction level of the transgene. The expression level of transgene can be measured through immunoblotting, following the procedures in steps 2.5.1 - 2.5.7.\n4. Depletion of Teb\nQuench the Teb stimuli by replacing Teb containing cell culture medium with Teb-free medium.\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to replace the growth media without first reseeding the cells onto a new culture dish. Residual Teb appears to cling to the plastic dish and will elicit a strong background expression of the transgene. Before reseeding the cells on a new culture plate, rinse the harvested cells several times with either culture medium or PBS.\n\t\nDissociate the cells from the culture dishes by trypsinization. After discarding the Teb containing culture medium, rinse the Teb-stimulated cells twice with pre-warmed PBS (37 °C), add 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA, and incubate for 1 min at 37 °C. After quenching the trypsin/EDTA by adding pre-warmed Teb-free culture medium (10 mL, 37 °C), harvest the cells using a cell scraper, followed by centrifugation in a 15 mL conical tube at 21,000 x g for 2 min at 18-25 °C.\nRe-suspend the cells in 50 mL of pre-warmed Teb-free culture medium (37 °C), and transfer 5 mL of the cells into three 60 mm fresh cell culture dishes. Culture the cells at 37 °C for 24, 48, and 72 h respectively.",
    "Harvest the cells at different time points and measure the expression level of the transgene by using immunoblotting.\n\t\tNOTE: Under these experimental conditions, the transgene expression became undetectable approximately 3 days post-culture of the cells in the Teb-free cultural medium (Figure 3). The expression level of transgene can be measured by immunoblotting, as per steps 2.5.1 - 2.5.7.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
