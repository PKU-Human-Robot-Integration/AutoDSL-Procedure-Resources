    "The experimental procedures described below were approved by the National Institute of Mental Health Animal Care and Use Committee and were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n1. Pre-operative Preparation\nClean all tools in a hot bead sterilizer before aseptic surgery, clean the surgery site with 70% ethanol, and put down clean drop cloths.  Wear sterile gloves.  Anesthetize the animal with freshly prepared 1.2% avertin solution, given at 0.02 ml/g, intraperitonially.  Alternatively, anesthetize with isoflurane gas through a nose cone, 5% for induction, 1.5% for maintenance, with a passive scavenger circuit.  Check the anesthesia level using tail or toe pinches to ensure full sedation.    \nCover the animal's eyes with sterile ophthalmic ointment, and inject freshly prepared dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg) and carprofen (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously to prevent brain swelling and inflammation11.  Shave the hair over the skull between the ears, and sterilize the skin with betadine scrub and three alternating swabs of 70% ethanol. \nMount the animal in a stereotaxic surgery stage with earbars, with a water circulation heating pad below the animal set at 37 °C.  Regularly check the animal's anesthesia levels, and supplement the original anesthetic dose as needed. \nInject 200 μl of 0.5% Marcaine under the scalp skin to numb the area.  Incise the skin and remove the skin flap over the skull.  Remove the periosteum and dry the area with clean cotton swabs. \n2. Chronic Cranial Window Surgery",
    "Use a high-speed dental drill with a 0.5 mm burr to gently outline a 3-5 mm diameter circle over the brain region of interest.  Periodically wet the drilling site with sterile 0.9% saline and clear away bone dust with clean cotton swabs.  If the bone bleeds, use gelfoam presoaked with sterile saline to blot the bleed and wait for it to stop.    \nWhen the last bone layer is reached, lift and remove the bone island with fine-tipped forceps.  Dura attachments to the bottom shelf of the bone may be encountered if the window crosses a bone suture.  These should be gently removed as the bone flap is lifted.\nRoll moistened gel foam gently over the exposed dura to clean its surface and wait for any dural bleeding to stop.  Critical step: do not proceed until all dural bleeding has stopped.  Blood that becomes trapped inside the cranial window usually leads to an opaque window. \nIf the region of interest is under a location where the dura is particularly thick, removing the dura above it may be necessary.  If this is the case, gently separate the dura from the pia below with very fine forceps, make a small incision in the lifted dura with another pair of fine forceps, then grasp the cut edges and gently split the dura.  The dura is thin but strong, so be careful not to slice the brain with the intact edges of the dura. \nRinse the area with sterile ACSF or sterile saline. \nLay a sterile glass coverslip (3-5 mm) over the dura or pia.  Critical step: If the surrounding skull curves significantly, use Kwiksil12 adhesive to fill in spaces where the dura or pia would not make close contact with the coverslip in regions that will not be imaged.",
    "Use cyanoacrylate gel to cover the elastomer adhesive and the edges of the glass coverslip.  Cover the entire exposed skull with cyanoacrylate gel, or a krazyglue and dental cement mixture.  Critical step: Do not allow any cyanoacrylate gel to touch the brain surface. \nEmbed a custom-made metal head fixation bar at the opposite end of the skull. \nReturn the animal to a warm recovery chamber, after an intraperitonial injection of ketoprofen, 5 mg/kg, for pain management.  Continue the analgesic for two more days post-operatively.    \nAfter two weeks of post-operative recovery, anesthetize the animal with isoflurane (5% for induction, 1.5% for maintenance), mount it in a custom-made microscope stage with a head-fixation frame, and check the cranial window for optical clarity under illumination with blue light.  Brain surface blood vessel clarity is highly indicative of cranial window quality.  If the blood vessel edges are sharply defined, the window is likely to be useable. The two-week post-operative recovery time is recommended to allow sufficient time for the animal to recover from surgery.  Cranial windows typically clear and improve during this time, and remain optically transparent for additional weeks to months until regrowth of skull or thickening of the dura degrades window quality. \n3. Behavioral Protocol and Laser Scanning Two-photon Microscopy\nAnimals with clear cranial windows will be exposed to an environmental stimulus or subjected to a behavioral training session, and then imaged afterwards at the time of maximal Arc-GFP expression.  Before beginning a behavioral protocol, the animal should be kept in a consistent home cage environment to minimize day-to-day variation in baseline Arc-GFP expression levels.",
    "Begin behavioral training or environmental stimulation paradigms, depending on the brain region of interest.  For example, animals can be exposed to different visual environments over consecutive days, and imaged each day after visual stimulation to identify stimulus-specific responses in the visual cortex10. \nArc-GFP fluorescence in neurons typically reaches its peak level two hours after stimulation.  The experimental timeline may be optimized to facilitate the detection of Arc-GFP expression in neurons at their peak fluorescence levels. \nAfter a behavioral training session or environmental stimulation is completed, anesthetize the animal with isoflurane (5% for induction, 1.5% for maintenance) and mount the animal in the custom-made microscope stage with head-fixation frame under the two-photon microscope. \nThe animal's head position is fixed to the head-fixation frame that connects directly to the stage, using the implanted metal bar on the skull.  Isoflurane and oxygen are continuously supplied to the mouse through a nose cone.  Body temperature is maintained using a heating pad.\nEnsure that the microscope detectors are protected from ambient light by conducting two-photon laser scanning in a dark room. Use a 20x or 25x (1.05 numerical aperture) water immersion lens for imaging.  First, under epi-fluorescence illumination, acquire an image of the surface blood vessel patterns over the brain region of interest with a CCD camera for future image alignment.",
    "Start two-photon laser scanning to acquire a 3-D image stack.  An Olympus FV1000MPE multi-photon microscope is used in our setup.  The excitation wave-length of the two-photon laser is set at 920 nm, and the power of the laser emitted from the objective is set at approximately 50 mW.  Emitted fluorescence is simultaneously detected in green and red channels (dichroic mirror at 570 nm, barrier filters at 495-540 nm and 570-625 nm), using an external two-channel photomutiplier detection system placed close to the specimen.  Arc-GFP fluorescence only appears in the green channel, whereas tissue auto-fluorescence appears in both channels13, 14.    \nTypical image stacks have dimensions of approximately 320x320x100  μm (width x length x depth), a horizontal resolution of 0.5  μm/pixel, and a vertical resolution of 3  μm/pixel.\nAfter acquiring the image stack, return the animal to its home cage. Do not disturb the animal until the next behavioral and imaging session.  Repeat the behavior and imaging procedure across days as desired.  Use the previously acquired brain surface blood vessel image to orient back to the same imaging location. \nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
