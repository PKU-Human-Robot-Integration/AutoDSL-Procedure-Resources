We use a 1 training session/day protocol, i.e., each training step we describe here should be performed on consecutive days. The probabilistic training protocol consists of two cues and associated reinforcement; one cue predicts likely reward (80% reward, 10% punishment, 10% omission) and the other cue predicts likely punishment (25% reward, 65% punishment, 10% omission).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/978-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. The probabilistic Pavlovian conditioning task\n(A) Flowchart indicating the states of the task.\n(B) Schematic diagram of reinforcement contingencies during different training phases.\nNote: These contingencies were calibrated to keep mice motivated on the task. We found that mice often stop licking the water spout when applying a higher ratio of air-puff punishments.\nNote: It takes approximately 1 week for young adult animals to reach Stage 5 on the task and then an additional week to achieve stable, good performance. Nevertheless, behavioral sessions of the full task can be continued beyond this period for recording or other purposes based on the experimental design. We observed stable performance for 2–3 months, beyond which we have no experience.\nInitial steps (perform these before each training session)",
    "Turn on the computer, plug in the speakers, launch Matlab and Bpod. If combined with recording, start the data acquisition system (e.g., Open Ephys; see refs. (Hangya et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Laszlovszky et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10])). If combined with optogenetic tagging (Lima et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Kvitsiani et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Hangya et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Széll et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]), turn on the laser.\nMake sure that the water tank used for reward is filled.\nClean the head-fixation platform with 70% ethanol.\nRemove the air bubbles from the water tube by opening the water valves through Bpod. Make sure to collect the water and thus keep the setup dry.\nPut the mouse onto the head-fixation platform of the setup. If combined with recording and/or optogenetics, connect the cables and/or patch chords as appropriate for your system.\nCarefully restrain the head of the animal.\nAdjust the position of the licking spout with an xyz-stage so that it is close to but not touching the animal’s snout.\nCritical: Make sure that the licking spout is well-positioned, within convenient range of the animal’s tongue. Too close, too far, and asymmetric positions critically impact behavioral performance. Using a dentist’s mirror tool can aid optimal positioning.\nCritical: Make sure that air has been completely removed from the water delivery system.\nHabituation to head restraint (see problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]), learning to lick for water (Operant phase)\nIn a brief operant phase, the mouse receives water reward (3–5 μL) every time it licks the water spout (see problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nCritical: If the mouse appears distressed, is vocalizing or trying to escape, terminate the protocol and attempt to repeat another time.\nIntroducing the cue that predicts likely reward (Stage 1)\nThe animal performs 20 operant trials (as in the Operant phase), then the reward predicting cues start.",
    "Each trial starts with a no-lick period, in which the mouse has to withhold licking for 1.5 s. This is followed by a variable foreperiod, randomized between 2 and 4 s.\nThen, a 1 s long pure tone is played, followed by a variable 200–400 ms delay (300 ms on average, with uniform distribution), after which the animal receives water reward in 80% of the trials, in a pseudorandomized order.\nIn this stage, there is no punishment; therefore, the reinforcer is omitted in the other 20% of the trials.\nNote: We recommend starting the training with the likely reward cue, since the high probability of reward after the cue motivates mice better during the initial training phase.\nNote: If the mouse licks in the foreperiod, the trial is restarted from the no-lick period. This way of enforcing no licking before the stimulus is not critical for forming the cue-reward association. However, it helps interpret the anticipatory lick response of mice (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]). It also helps disentangle neural responses correlated with licking vs. different phases of the trials when concurrent recordings are performed (see problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nCritical: The variable delay between tone offset and reward delivery is important for the formation of the anticipatory lick response (see quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis]). In our experience, if the reward delivery time is fully predictable, some mice do not develop anticipatory lick responses.\nIntroducing the cue that will predict likely punishment (Stage 2)\nThe animal performs 5 operant trials before the cued outcome trials. Two pure tones of well-separated pitch (e.g., 4 kHz and 12 kHz) predict likely reward (75% of all trials) or unlikely reward (25% of all trials) in a pseudorandomized order. (The latter cue will predict likely punishment in future training phases.)",
    "There is no punishment in this training phase; therefore, the likely reward cues are followed by reward in 80% and omission in 20% of the cases, whereas the unlikely reward cues are followed by reward in 25% and omission in 75%.\nNote: We recommend testing mice with reversed cue-reward contingencies to rule out that the cue tones themselves induce differential behavior or neural activity based on their potential behavioral significance or previous experience of the animals.\nIntroducing punishment (Stage 3)\nOperant trials are not included for this phase.\nAir puff punishments are introduced in this phase. This modifies the outcome probabilities as follows: the likely reward cues predict 80% reward, 10% punishment, 10% omission and the likely punishment cues predict 25% reward, 65% punishment and 10% omission.\nThese probabilities represent the final task contingencies. The two trial types are pseudorandomly interleaved in a 3:1 ratio, as in the previous phase.\nNote: The animals’ performance can transiently drop at this stage due to the aversive nature of air puff punishment (see problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nRamping up likely punishment trials (Stage 4)\nLikely reward and likely punishment trials are pseudorandomly interleaved in a 6:4 ratio.\nFinal task (Stage 5)\nLikely reward and likely punishment trials are pseudorandomly interleaved in a 1:1 ratio.\nThis is the final phase of the training protocol, and it can be maintained throughout the course of the experiment.\nNote: Mice are actively engaged in more trials if they are trained at the beginning of their active (dark) phase (Remmelink et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]; Birtalan et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]), although we had success in training during the light phase as well. Nevertheless, we recommend adjusting the time of training to the light/dark cycle of the animals (see also problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).",
    "Critical: Training should be performed at a consistent time of day, maintained throughout the experiment (Gritton et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nNote: When training multiple animals sequentially, keeping the order of mice helps maintain consistency during the experiment and further reducing environmental factors that can lead to poor performance. However, see problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nCritical: Overtraining animals on intermediate stages slows down or prevents further learning; ideally do not train more than 1 or 2 days on the intermediate stages of the task. Note that aged (over 12 months) mice learn slower and may be trained up to 3 days on intermediate steps.\nCritical: Skipping training days at the initial phase of the training (especially in the first week) can significantly reduce performance and the animal may not be able to learn the task eventually.\nCritical: The cumulative water consumed during the training session should be taken into account when calculating daily water consumption.\nCritical: The daily water should be provided hours after the training session, ideally approximately at the same time every day, to prevent mice from forming an association between water and the end of training.\nPerfusion\nTiming: 1 h\nAfter concluding the behavioral experiments, animals are anesthetized, and the brain tissue is preserved by transcardial perfusion of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) fixative.\nNote: This process is performed when the training protocol is combined with neuronal recordings or optogenetic manipulations, to allow histological processing of the brains. However, transcardial perfusion is not necessary for purely behavioral or systemic pharmacological manipulation studies.\nPut mice in an isoflurane chamber to induce anesthesia.\nInject mice with a mixture of ketamine, xylazine and promethazine intraperitoneally (83 mg/kg, 17 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg respectively, dissolved in saline) to achieve deep anesthesia.\nWait until the animal does not respond to tail pinch.",
    "Restrain the limbs on the perfusion platform.\nStart the perfusion pump with saline.\nMake a longitudinal cut on the skin over the abdominal region by using small surgical scissors and tweezers.\nHold the xiphoid process with a pair of forceps and cut the diaphragm to open the chest cavity. Carefully avoid piercing the heart.\nCut the ribcage on both sides; hold the basis of the sternum and lift it up, exposing the heart.\nMake a small incision at the apex of the left ventricle and insert a feeding needle (connected to the perfusion pump). Gently push the needle into the aorta. Fix the needle with a small clamp.\nMake a small cut on the right atrium to drain the blood.\nPerfuse with saline for ∼2 min, then switch to 4% paraformaldehyde fixative for an additional 20 min.\nStop the pump and disconnect the feeding needle.\nDecapitate the animal and remove the brain.\nOptional: The brain can be immersed in 4% PFA for enhanced preservation or can be stored in a buffer solution with sodium-azid at 4C°."
