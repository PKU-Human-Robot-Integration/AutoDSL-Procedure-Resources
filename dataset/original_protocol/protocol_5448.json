    "Generation of the codon-optimized Tg(UAS:GFP-aequorin-opt) transgenic line    Generate a codon-optimized sequence, GFP-aequorin-opt, for expression in zebrafish from original sequence of mammalian GFP-aequorin (we used to online tool freely available made by Integrated DNA Technology: https://eu.idtdna.com/CodonOpt[href=https://eu.idtdna.com/CodonOpt], original and optimized DNA sequences provided in Supplement file 2[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20170903/Supplement file 2 Sequence aequorin GFP optimized Zf.docx]).   Subclone GFP-aequorin-opt into a PT2 14xUAS plasmid.   Inject the UAS:GFP-aequorin-opt construct in the Tg(mnx1:gal4)icm11 embryos to generate the Tg(mnx1:gal4;UAS:GFP-aequorin-opt)icm09 double transgenic line. Injection mix is composed as follows: 2 µl ADN (120 ng/µl) + 2 µl ARN transposase (175 ng/µl) + 1 µl KCl 2 M +1 µl 2% phenol red, complete to 10 µl with MilliQ H2O.   Maintain adult AB and Tüpfel long fin (TL) strains of Danio rerio on a 14/10 h light cycle and water is maintained at 28.5 °C, conductivity at 500 μS and pH at 7.4.    Raise embryos in ‘blue water’ (3 g of Instant Ocean® salts and 2 ml of methylene blue at 1% in 10 L of osmosed water, see Recipes) at 28.5 °C during the first 24 h before screening for GFP expression.     Characterization of GFP-aequorin expression with immunohistochemistry   Fix 4 dpf larvae in 4% PFA for 4 h at 4 °C followed by 3 x 5 min washes in PBS.   Block larvae for 1 h in blocking solution (see Recipes) (agitation required).   Incubate larvae with the primary antibody (anti-GFP, dilution 1:500) over night at 4 °C in incubation solution (see Recipes) (agitation required).    Wash three times for 5 min in washing solution (see Recipes), then incubate larvae in the dark with the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-chicken IgG, dilution1:1,000) in PBST (agitation required) for 2 h at RT.",
    "Wash three times for 5 min in PBST, then mount larvae on a slide with mounting medium and image on a standard upright confocal microscope (Olympus FV-1000).    Perform negative IHC controls by omitting the primary antibody.   Image the entire immunostained Tg(mnx1:gal4;UAS:GFP-aequorin-opt)icm09 larvae to confirm selective expression of GFP-aequorin-opt in spinal motor neuron populations and absence from muscle fibers. We noted more prominently primary dorsal motor neurons but also intermediate and ventral secondary motor neurons (Figure 1) without any expression in the muscles and only very limited expression in the brain and hindbrain.  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170911/20170911204037_2159.jpg Figure 1. Expression pattern of GFP-aequorin-opt in motor neurons. Fluorescent image (upper panel) and immunohistochemistry for GFP (lower panel) in a 4 dpf Tg(mnx1:gal4;UAS:GFP-aequorin-opt) double transgenic zebrafish larva showing selective expression in spinal motor neurons (arrowhead: dorsal primary, arrow: ventral secondary motor neurons), and strictly no expression in muscle fibers (white arrow in the upper panel).      Soaking of larvae in coelenterazine solution   Prepare 10 mM stock solution from lyophilized coelenterazine-h: e.g.,    For 250 µg of coelenterazine-h, final volume is 60 µl (M = 407.5 g/M).   Add propylene glycol to (25% of final volume, e.g., 15.4 µl).   Sonicate cyclodextrine at 45% (4.5 g in 10 ml).   Add cyclodextrine (75% of final volume, e.g., 46 µl).    Prepare 60 µM coelenterazine-h soaking solution from stock: Dilute stock solution in ‘blue water’ (e.g., 6 µl in 1 ml for 10 embryos).   Dechorionate embryos at 1 day post-fertilization under optical magnification.   Soak dechorionated embryos overnight at 26 °C (e.g., 100 µl for each embryo, use 48-well plate sealed with paraffin).   Renew 60 µM soaking solution at 2 days post-fertilization. Embryos are maintained in the dark.   Perform behavioral experiments at 4 days post-fertilization (total soaking time is 72 h).",
    "Monitoring neuronal activity with bioluminescence   Build a lightproof setup for bioluminescence assay (Figure 2)  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170911/20170911204557_7801.jpg Figure 2. Bioluminescence setup for escapes. A. Signals emitted from spinal motor neurons in Tg(mnx1:gal4;UAS:GFP-aequorin-opt) double transgenic zebrafish larvae at 4 dpf were recorded using a photomultiplier tube under infrared illumination during active behaviors elicited by an acoustic stimulus. B. Picture of the setup showing every component: 1: high-speed camera; 2: 50 mm objective; 3: IR 850 nm LED; 4: Diffuser; 5: Long-pass filters; 6: photomultiplier tube.    Using black boards, create a 1 m square lightproof box.   Infrared light illumination is provided by an 850 nm LED mounted with 2 long-pass 780 and 810 filters and a diffuser.    Video acquisition is performed at 1,000 Hz using a high-speed infrared sensitive camera at 320 x 320 pixels resolution controlled by the video software (Hiris®).    Photons are counted with a photomultiplier tube located under the larva arena and sent to an acquisition card. A band-pass filter (525 nm/50 nm) and a short-pass filter (670 nm) are placed between the larva and the PMT.   A custom application-programming interface synchronizes the video acquisition with the photon count and the stimulus delivery using a 30 trials batched TTL chronogram.     Run the bioluminescence assay one larva at a time   Place larva in a circular (2 cm diameter) 3D-printed arena (larva can also be head-embedded in 1.5% low-melting point agarose with the tail free to move).   Place the larva in the arena and attach the arena to a small 2-Ohm speaker.   Deliver sinusoidal stimuli (5 cycles, 500 Hz) produced by the waveform generator and audio amplifier through a 2-Ohm speaker attached to the larva arena.   Adjust intensity to the lowest value reliably eliciting an escape response (between 0.5 and 5 V usually).",
    "Each trial consists in a 500 msec baseline followed by a 10 msec acoustic stimulus and 1,990 msec subsequent recording.   Assays consist of 30 trials with 1-min inter-trial intervals to reduce habituatio."
