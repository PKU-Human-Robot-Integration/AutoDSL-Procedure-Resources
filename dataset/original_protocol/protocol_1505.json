    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMitochondrial preparation\nTiming: 2–3 h\nMitoPunch requires a freshly isolated stock of cell-free mitochondria for transfer into recipient cells. This protocol uses the Qiagen Qproteome Mitochondrial Isolation Kit[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=b13c089e-17ec-4707-8efe-10d52d84349d&lang=en] (Qiagen, Cat#37612) with minor optimizations for efficiency and purity in this application; however, other mitochondrial isolation methods are also compatible with MitoPunch. Here we define purity as the absence of intact mitochondrial donor cells that escape through the disruption and mitochondrial isolation process. We have measured the purity of our mitochondrial isolates in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]-figure supplement 1 of (Sercel et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nHarvest mitochondrial donor cells.\nAspirate culture medium from T-225 flasks.\nPipette 20 mL DPBS into each flask.\nRelease cells from the flasks using a cell scraper.\nSuspend scraped cells in DPBS and collect into 50 mL conical tubes.\nCentrifuge tubes at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Aspirate supernatant.\nWash cell pellets in 10 mL DPBS and centrifuge again at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Aspirate supernatant.\nCritical: Keep samples on ice when outside the centrifuge for the remainder of the mitochondrial isolation process.\nDisrupt mitochondrial donor cells using the Qiagen Qproteome Mitochondrial Isolation Kit.\nNote: The buffers used in the following steps are from the Qiagen Qproteome Mitochondrial Isolation Kit and must be handled according to manufacturer protocol.\nResuspend cell pellets in ice-cold Lysis Buffer at a concentration of ∼1 × 107 cells per 1 mL and transfer to 2 mL tubes.\nPrepare Lysis Buffer with 1:100 Protease Inhibitor Solution prior to resuspension.\nIncubate on end-over-end shaker for 10 min at 4°C.\nNote: Ensure microcentrifuge is chilled to 4°C during this incubation in preparation for the next step.\nCentrifuge the samples at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C and aspirate supernatant without disrupting the pellet.",
    "Resuspend each cell pellet in 1.5 mL ice cold Disruption Buffer with a 1 mL pipette tip.\nPrepare Disruption Buffer with 1:100 Protease Inhibitor Solution prior to resuspension.\nDisrupt cells using a blunt-ended 26G (VWR, Cat#89134-164) needle attached to a 3 mL Luer-Lok syringe.\nSlowly pull the entire lysate into the syringe and expel the volume 10 times, avoiding the formation of bubbles in the suspension.\nNote: If clogging of the disruption needle occurs, see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nMitochondrial purification.\nCentrifuge lysate at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4°C and transfer supernatant to a new sterile 1.5 mL tube.\nOptional: Repeat this step to reduce the probability of intact cells contaminating the mitochondrial preparation.\nNote: Pellet will be diffuse and easily disrupted. Take care in removing supernatant to minimize the mass of pellet that is carried over to the next step.\nNote: Supernatants should be combined at this point.\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 6000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Carefully aspirate supernatant.\nNote: The pellet now contains isolated mitochondria.\nResuspend the pellet with 1 mL Mitochondrial Storage Buffer using a 1 mL pipette tip and centrifuge at 6000 × g for 20 min at 4°C.\nCritical: Prepare the MitoPunch apparatus during this centrifugation step to minimize time between resuspension of mitochondrial isolate and MitoPunch transfer as MitoPunch efficiency is negatively impacted by older mitochondrial preparations.\nRemove supernatant. The mitochondrial mass should appear as a compact, pin-head-sized pellet at the bottom of the 1.5 mL tube.\nResuspend the mitochondrial pellet in a volume of DPBS with calcium and magnesium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#14040133) equal to 120 μL times the number of MitoPunch replicates and keep on ice.\nMitoPunch mitochondrial transfer\nTiming: 1 h",
    "The following instructions describe the process of delivering freshly isolated mitochondria to recipient cells using the MitoPunch apparatus. Briefly, the mechanism by which MitoPunch delivers isolated mitochondria to recipient cells requires pressure generated by a solenoid-driven mechanical plunger. Isolated mitochondria are loaded into a PDMS reservoir to which a cell culture filter insert seeded with recipient cells is sealed. The solenoid is activated which drives the mechanical plunger into the underside of the PDMS reservoir, causing the internal pressure of the reservoir to increase. This increase in pressure forces mitochondrial suspension directly through the pores in the filter insert and into the recipient cell cytoplasm. We have previously quantified the transfer efficiency of MitoPunch by delivering fluorescently labeled isolated mitochondria to 143 BTK− ρ0 and BJ ρ0 recipient cells and measuring the fraction of the recipients positive for the fluorescent marker by imaging flow cytometry (Sercel et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). We observe ∼50% of 143 BTK− ρ0 recipient cells and ∼15% of BJ ρ0 recipients as positive for the fluorescent mitochondria. Additionally, we measured the mean and median number of fluorescent mitochondrial puncta present in recipient cells by imaging flow cytometry. We observed a mean of ∼5 and a median of ∼3 puncta for 143 BTK− ρ0 recipients and a mean of ∼2 and a median of ∼1 puncta for BJ ρ0 recipients. Finally, it is important to keep the isolated mitochondrial sample on ice while performing MitoPunch transfers and to minimize the time that isolated mitochondria are kept on ice prior to transfer.\nSpray 70% ethanol into a tissue and wipe down the MitoPunch apparatus before entering it into a biosafety cabinet.",
    "Connect MitoPunch apparatus to breadboard and connect breadboard to power supply (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). Connect power supply to the 120 V wall outlet and ensure device has power by testing piston actuation.\nRemove a sterile PDMS reservoir from an autoclave bag and place on MitoPunch apparatus.\nWash PDMS reservoir 3 times with 120 μL DPBS with calcium and magnesium, pipetting up and down 3 times with each wash, being sure to cover the entire surface area of the reservoir.\nNote: This step is important to remove any traces of bleach or ethanol from pre-autoclave sterilization and to help the hydrophobic PDMS more readily hold the mitochondrial suspension evenly without pooling into a large droplet.\nPipette 120 μL mitochondrial suspension or DPBS control into the PDMS reservoir.\nRemove 12-well dish of recipient-cell-seeded filter inserts from the incubator and enter it into the biosafety cabinet. Using sterile forceps, remove one filter insert and secure it into the top plate of the MitoPunch apparatus.\nTo secure, remove the top internal ring from the upper plate of the MitoPunch and place the plastic wings of the filter insert on the remaining ring such that the filter insert is supported within the hole of the top plate. Carefully screw the top internal ring until tight against the filter wings.\nLower the top plate along the optomechanical assembly rods such that the filter insert contacts the PDMS reservoir and ensure it is firmly pressed against the PDMS, creating a seal.\nActuate the MitoPunch piston using the switch on the breadboard. Leave the piston in the protracted position for 3 s, release the piston switch, remove the filter insert from the apparatus, and replace it in the 12-well dish in its original medium.",
    "Critical: Apply gentle pressure to the top plate with a hand while actuating the solenoid to maintain a seal between the filter insert and the PDMS.\nAfter completing all MitoPunch transfers, place the 12-well dish in a humidified 37°C incubator for 2 h prior to collecting the recipient cells.\nRecipient cell collection\nTiming: 1 h\nMitochondrial recipient cells need to be harvested and plated on 10 cm dishes after the 2 h incubation that follows mitochondrial transfer for expansion and selection.\nAspirate medium from the wells containing filter inserts.\nCarefully aspirate medium from within the filter insert, being mindful to not contact the cell layer on the PET membrane.\nAspirate medium from outside the filter insert, making sure to collect the medium retained at the contact point between the bottom of the filter insert and the well.\nNote: The PET filter can retain medium and reduce the efficacy of dissociation reagents if not handled properly.\nCritical: Change aspirator tip between samples to avoid contamination of intact cells from the mitochondrial preparation that may be present on the outside of the filter insert.\nWash filter inserts with DPBS without calcium and magnesium.\nApply 0.5 mL DPBS gently to the filter insert and 1.5 mL DPBS to the well outside the filter insert.\nCarefully aspirate DPBS from within the filter insert and then from outside the insert, being sure to remove any residual liquid retained between the bottom of the filter and the well.\nCritical: Ensure that DPBS reaches both sides of the filter insert.\nCritical: Change aspirator tip between samples to avoid contamination of intact cells from the mitochondrial preparation that may be present on the outside of the filter insert.\nApply Accutase dissociation reagent to the filters and incubate for 5 min in a 37°C humidified incubator.",
    "Pipette 0.5 mL Accutase to the filter insert and 1.5 mL to the well outside the insert.\nCritical: Ensure that Accutase reaches both sides of the filter insert.\nNote: Visually inspect the plate under an inverted microscope to verify that the cells have released from the filter. If dissociation is incomplete (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B), return plate to the incubator for 3 min and repeat until cells have released from the membrane (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C).\nOnce the cells are released from the membrane, apply 0.5 mL uridine-supplemented medium to the filter insert and gently disrupt the cell layer with a 1 mL pipette tip.\nDo not draw liquid from outside the filter to reduce the risk of intact mitochondrial donor cell contamination.\nPipette the full volume from the filter insert to a 10 cm dish containing 10 mL warm uridine-supplemented complete medium. If few cells are observed in the dish, see troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nPlace 10 cm dishes in a 37°C humidified incubator.\nSIMR clone selection\nTiming: 1 week\nRecipient cells need to be cultured in a dialyzed, nucleotide-free selection medium to isolate stable mitochondrial recipient cells. The selection medium is not permissive for ρ0 cells as they are incapable of generating nucleotides de novo. A negative ρ0 control is essential for determining the endpoint of the following selection protocol.\nIncubate the 10 cm dishes of MitoPunch recipient cells in a 37°C humidified incubator with uridine-supplemented complete medium for 3 d following transfer.\nCritical: Monitor confluence daily and do not allow cultures to exceed 80% confluence. If cultures reach >80% confluence, proceed with step 20.\nExchange the complete medium for SIMR selection medium.\nExchange the medium daily with 10 mL fresh SIMR selection medium and record the confluence of the ρ0 negative control.",
    "Note: Small colonies will form on the MitoPunch recipient plates and be visible by microscopy typically 3–5 d into SIMR selection medium treatment.\nContinue daily feeding with SIMR selection medium until the ρ0 control plate is no longer viable, typically 5–7 d under SIMR selection medium treatment.\nNote: Proceed to either clone isolation or crystal violet staining as soon as the control plate is no longer viable.\nAlternatives: When the recipient cells used were determined to require galactose SIMR selection medium in Test recipient cell sensitivity to different SIMR clone selection media conditions, proceed to step 22.\nAt 5 d post-delivery, feed cells with galactose SIMR selection medium.\nNote: Follow selection scheme developed in “Test recipient cell sensitivity to different SIMR clone selection media” for the specific recipient cells used.\nSelection medium should be exchanged daily and condition of the cells noted.\nContinue galactose selection until the DPBS control transfer has completely died, up to 7 d post-transfer.\nAfter death of the control, exchange the selection medium for SIMR selection medium to allow clones to grow large enough to harvest.\nNote: When selection fails to slow cell growth and induce cell death, see troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]. In the event no clones appear after selection, see troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nSIMR clone harvesting\nTiming: 1 h\nAfter the selection process, isolate SIMR clones from 10 cm dishes and passage them onto 6-well dishes for expansion. This must be done before clones overgrow as large clones can merge with neighboring clones or become internally over confluent and die.\nSelect clones for isolation that are not adjacent to or in contact with other clones.\nNote: When selecting multiple clones, mark the location of desired clones with a permanent marker or a microscope mounted object marker.",
    "Aspirate the medium from the dish and wash with 5 mL of DPBS. Aspirate the DPBS.\nFor each clone to be isolated, coat one side of a cylinder in sterilized high-vacuum grease. Gently adhere each cylinder to the dish and fully encompass one clone within the cylinder.\nSlowly add 200 μL of Accutase to each cylinder and incubate for 5 min in a 37°C humidified incubator.\nCritical: Watch for any leaks from the bottom of the cylinder while adding dissociation reagent and immediately stop when one appears. Any leaked dissociation reagent can prematurely disrupt other clones adhered to the plate.\nAfter incubation, verify that the cells have fully dissociated from the dish under an inverted microscope.\nWhen the cells have not fully dissociated, incubate for another 3 min.\nOnce the cells have fully dissociated, use a micropipettor to move the cell suspension into a well of a 6-well dish containing 2 mL of warm complete medium.\nIncubate the newly plated clones in a 37°C humidified incubator and continue to expand until ready for use in downstream analysis.\nCrystal violet staining\nTiming: 2 h\nThis protocol enables visualization of clone morphology, number, and distribution. Plates treated with this protocol can be stored indefinitely away from light. Additionally, when stain does fade with time, plates can be re-stained with additional crystal violet to increase color saturation for future imaging.\nAspirate medium from the plate, taking care to not disturb clones.\nApply 1 mL of freshly diluted 4% paraformaldehyde to the dish and tilt the dish to fully coat the surface.\nIncubate at RT in a chemical fume hood for 15 min.\nAspirate the 4% paraformaldehyde from the dish and dispose of in the appropriate chemical waste container.",
    "Apply 2 mL of crystal violet solution to each plate and tilt to fully coat. Incubate at RT in the chemical fume hood for 30 min.\nRemove excess crystal violet using a serological pipette and dispose of it in the appropriate chemical waste container.\nRinse each plate twice with DI water to remove excess crystal violet solution.\nDry plates upside-down on an absorbent surface to allow any residual crystal violet solution to drip off the plate.\nStore plates away from light until ready to analyze."
