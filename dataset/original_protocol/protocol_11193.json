    "This single-center retrospective study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board of Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University.\n1. Obtaining informed consent\nBefore the TRA interventions, have interventional radiologists (IRs) explain the benefits and potential complications of TRA to the patients.\n2. Patient evaluation\nAfter obtaining informed consent, evaluate the RA for the feasibility of puncture and cannulation.\nPerform a comprehensive review of the patient's medical history. Confirm if patients had severe vascular tortuosity, severe peripheral vascular disease, a fistula for dialysis, or preparation for RA dialysis operation. These are relative contraindications for patients receiving TRA interventions.\nEvaluate the visibility of the RA.\n\t\nPerform a Barbeau test with the use of pulse oximetry to evaluate how visible the hand collateral arteries are before intervention11. The Barbeau D waveform is considered an absolute contraindication for RA cannulation.\nFor patients tested as Barbeau C waveform, apply a Doppler ultrasound examination to provide more reliable information about the amount of collateral circulation in the forearm and hand. An inner diameter smaller than 2 mm is considered a contraindication.\n\t\tNOTE: After medical history evaluation and the RA evaluation, patients with contraindications should abstain from a puncture via the ipsilateral RA. The contralateral RA might serve as an ideal supply if it is found to be patent through Barbeau test evaluation. The left RA is initially chosen as a preferred access route. The right RA might serve as an alternative choice if the left RA was found unsuitable.\n3. Radial artery access\nPlace the patient in a supine position on the angiography table. Then, place the left arm parallel to the patient’s body and close to the left waist, allowing easy placement of the catheter and wire and enabling operator positioning comparable to that with the TFA.",
    "Mark the distal RA pulse by palpation. Clean the skin surface with 10% povidone-iodine surgical scrub solution and allow the solution to air dry. Cover the left arm with a surgical drape.\n\t\nIn case of potential left RA puncture failure, prepare an alternative access route by sterilizing and draping the right arm or right inguinal region.\nApply local anesthesia (i.e., 1 mL of lidocaine 2%) proximal to the styloid process along the axis of the most powerful pulsation of the left RA.\nExtend the wrist, and puncture the RA with a 20 G needle using the modified Seldinger technique. When pulsatile arterial blood return isobserved , introduce a 0.025 inch hydrophilic guidewire.\n\t\nRetract the guidewire and readjust the needle if resistance is encountered. Do not force the insertion of the guidewire. With the assistance of of digital subtraction angiography (DSA), inject about 1 to 2 mL of contrast to highlight the RA and help insert the hydrophilic guidewire.\nOnce access is obtained, remove the needle and introduce a 4-French hydrophilic sheath with the guidewire. After sheath insertion, gently pump back a small amount of arterial blood with a syringe to confirm that the sheath tip is within the vessel.\n4. Anticoagulation and vascular dilation\nPrepare 10 mL of a vasodilation cocktail solution (3,000 IU of unfractionated heparin, 0.1 mg of nitroglycerin, and 20 mg of lidocaine).\nAdminister 8 mL of the vasodilation cocktail solution through the sheath at a speed of 0.5 mL/s (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: Reduce or stop the dose of heparin for patients with moderate or high bleeding risk.\n5. Catheter selection",
    "Use a 4-French, 125 cm common catheter and a standard 0.035 inch x 180 cm hydrophilic wire to traverse the subclavian artery and engage the descending aorta. Use DSA fluoroscopy to visualize the proximal axillary artery during navigation within the arm to avoid potential lesions to an artery loop or vascular tortuosity.\n\tNOTE: The subclavian artery has many arterial branches. Angiographic guidance prevents guidewire catheters from entering collateral vessels during retrograde catheterization. A few cases have an artery loop in the radial artery. If the standard wire cannot pass the loop, use of a microcatheter and angled 0.016 inch or 0.018 inch microwire is recommended.\nUse the 4-French, 125 cm common catheter in combination with a standard 0.035-inch wire to negotiate the transverse arch to direct the guidewire toward the descending aorta.\n\tNOTE: If the angle between the aorta and left subclavian artery is very acute, a Cobra 2-shaped catheter (e.g., Simmons I or Simmons II catheter) is recommended to accomplish this turn.\nAfter catheterization of the descending aorta, replace the common catheter via a coaxial technique. Once the common catheter is inserted into the descending aorta, steer the catheter tip ventrally for catheterization of the celiac trunk under the guidance of DSA fluoroscopy. In most cases, it is easy to catheterize and perform angiography of the celiac trunk, the hepatic artery, and superior mesenteric artery.\n\tNOTE: If the angle between the celiac artery and the descending aorta is very acute, use a Cobra catheter to complete the procedure.\nFor hepatic embolization procedures, perform super-selective catheterization and chemoembolization using a coaxial technique and place a 2.8-French 150 cm microcatheter into the targeted branch of the hepatic artery feeding the tumors (Figure 2). Perform TACE according to the burden of disease and patient preference.",
    "Perform an angiogram through the common catheter using a high-pressure injector to confirm adequate embolization. The catheter tip is usually located in the common hepatic artery. Inject 9–12 mL of the contrast agent at a rate of 3–4 mL per s, with a fluoroscopy time of ~15 s. Then, remove the catheter over a guidewire to avoid damage to the RA. \n6. Radial artery hemostasis\nNOTE: Nonocclusive hemostasis is performed using a special tourniquet to maintain RA patency (Figure 3).\nAdminister the remaining 2 mL of vasodilation cocktail solutions (section 4) through the RA sheath. Immediately after, retrieve the sheath about 5 cm.\nPlace a tourniquet over the radial access site on the left wrist, and adequately inflate the tourniquet air bag of with air using the accompanying syringe. Then completely remove the sheath, and slowly deflate the air bag. When leaking is observed at the access site, add 1 mL of air back to the cuff. Typically, 10–15 mL of air is added to the air bag to keep hemostasis.\nConfirm that there is no bleeding or leaking. At the same time, ensure that the distal radial artery pulse is palpable during hemostasis. Use the pulse oximeter waveform to confirm the arterial waveform on the left thumb.\nSlowly inflate the air sac at ~2 mL every 2 h for no longer than 6 h. Reconfirm that hemostasis is accomplished once the tourniquet is removed 6 h after operation.\n\tNOTE: If bleeding or leaking from the puncture site is observed during deflation, air is added back to the air sac for 30 min and the process is repeated.\nBefore discharge, conduct Barbeau test to confirm the patency of the RA and record patients with radial artery occlusion and closely follow up.\n7. Follow up",
    "About 1 month after intervention, give TRA patients a thorough physical examination, including inspection of the left wrist and pulse examination. For patients with potentially occluded RAs, perform subsequent evaluations of hand blood supply using forearm Doppler ultrasound or pulse oximetry.\nClosely follow up all patients after TACE. If new tumor nodules were evident on CT scans and the initial lesions seemed to revascularize, perform another TACE treatment.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
