    "1. Preparation of nanoparticle probes\nNOTE: This assay utilizes Functionalized Gold Nanorods (AuNRs; 25 nm diameter x 71 nm length) that are covalently conjugated with neutravidin polymers (AV) and have a surface plasmon resonance peak that produces a red (641 nm peak) scattering signal upon DFM illumination.\nWash 40 µL of AuNR-AV (2.56 x 1011 particles) three times with 200 µL PBS (pH 7.0) by centrifugation and aspiration (8,500 x g at 4 °C for 10 minutes), followed by a final centrifugation and aspiration step after which the AuNR-AV pellet is suspended in 40 µL PBS.\nMix this AuNR-AV suspension with 10 µL biotinylated antibody (0.5 mg/mL) specific for an antigen on the surface of the exosome subtype of interest and 150 µL of PBS and then mix at 4 °C for 2 h using a mixer to allow neutravidin-biotin binding to reach completion.\nWash the resulting antibody-conjugated AuNRs (AuNR-IgG) three times by centrifugation and aspiration (6,500 x g at 4 °C for 10 minutes), and then suspend them in 200 µL PBS and store them at 4 °C until use.\n\tNOTE: Sterile technique and short storage times must be used to avoid contamination and degradation of the AuNR-IgG. It is best to use antibody-conjugated AuNRs within 24 hours of their conjugation.\n2. Preparation of EV capture slides\nDilute selected exosome capture antibodies to 0.025 mg/mL in PBS and add 1 µL/well of this dilution onto a multi-well protein A/G slide, and then incubate this slide at 37 °C for 1 h in a humidified chamber to allow capture antibody binding to protein A/G immobilized on the slide.",
    "Aspirate wells to remove unbound antibodies, and wash wells three times by the addition and aspiration of 1 µL/well of PBS, then load each well with 1 µL of blocking buffer (see Table of Materials) and incubate the slide for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber to block any remaining protein binding sites.\nAspirate wells to remove blocking buffer, wash wells three times by the addition and aspiration of 1 µL/well of PBS, and immediately use the blocked slides for exosome capture and analysis.\n3. Standard curve preparation\nTo accurately quantify the absolute or relative abundance of a specific exosome subtype, the user must generate a standard curve with a pure exosome population that uniformly expresses the exosome surface biomarker of interest. This study analyzes the abundance of exosomes expressing a metastasis-associated membrane protein, Ephrin A2 receptor, which has a reported relationship with pancreatic cancer stage and prognosis6,18.\n\tNOTE: The human pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1 and its exosomes are known to express this protein and isolated exosomes from this cell line were used to generate a standard curve to quantify the number of exosomes that express this protein in complex exosome samples.\nCulture cells for 48 hours at 37 °C in serum-free culture media to allow exosome accumulation in the media, then isolate cell culture supernatants by centrifugation of suspension cultures or direct aspiration of culture media from adherent cell cultures.\nCentrifuge the collected media at 2000 x g for 30 min to remove debris and recover the supernatant.\nFilter the clarified culture supernatant through a 0.45 µm low protein binding filter unit of appropriate capacity (e.g. a 250 mL polyethersulfone vacuum filtration unit).",
    "Concentrate the resulting filtrate by centrifugation at 3200 x g using a 100,000 nominal molecular weight limit filter system to a 250 µL final volume. Collect the retained volume from this filter, then wash the filter with 200 µL PBS, and combine this wash volume with the collected exosome sample volume.\nCentrifuge this sample at 21,000 x g for 45 minutes and carefully recover the supernatant, taking care not to collect any precipitated material.\nCentrifuge the recovered supernatant at 100,000 x g for 3 hours to precipitate the exosomes. Aspirate away the supernatant and collect the exosome pellet in 100 µL PBS.\nStore the resulting exosome suspensions at 4 °C if used within 24 hours or at -80 °C for long term storage.\n\tNOTE: Do not subject exosome samples to repeat freeze-thaw cycles.\nQuantify an aliquot of the exosome suspension after mixing by direct measurement of exosome numbers (e.g., by nanoparticle tracking analysis or tunable resistive pulse sensing or by measuring the protein concentration of exosome lysates by micro-bicinchoninic acid assay, or an equivalent method, as a means to approximate exosome quantity)16,19.\nGenerate a set of serial dilutions of the exosome suspension to allow comparison of nanoparticle signal to input exosome number or protein content.\nTransfer 1 µL of each exosome standard to each of its replicate wells on the assay plate.\n\tNOTE: Standard curves can be used to calculate the slope of the correlation line between nanoparticle signal and exosome concentration to (1) evaluate assay performance and (2) determine the relative concentration of target exosomes in experimental samples.\n4. Processing human plasma or serum samples",
    "Collect plasma or serum samples by standard methods and store at -80 °C until needed for exosome analysis. Rapidly thaw samples in a room temperature water bath. Repeatedly mix the thawed samples by inversion to promote homogenous suspension.\n\tNOTE: Results from serum and plasma samples may not be equivalent, since there is a significant release of exosomes during the clotting reaction.\nCentrifuge plasma or serum samples at 500 x g for 15 min to precipitate protein aggregates and other debris. Transfer an aliquot of the plasma or serum sample to a fresh tube and add PBS to generate a 1:1 dilution. Mix the diluted sample by gentle vortexing or inversion, as appropriate. Transfer 1 µL of each plasma or serum suspension to each of its replicate wells on the assay plate.\n5. Exosome capture and detection\nLoad wells of a blocked EV capture slide with 1 µL/well of exosome sample, using 8 replicates per sample, and incubate the slide overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. Aspirate all sample wells and then add 1 µL/well of PBS to wash wells and remove unbound exosomes and other contaminants from the loaded exosome sample.\nLoad sample wells with 1 µL/well of a previously prepared AuNR-IgG suspension (see section 1 above) and incubate the slide for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Aspirate the nanoparticle solution and wash the slide in PBS supplemented with 0.01% Tween-20 (PBST) for 10 min using a mixer, then aspirate and wash all sample wells with deionized water for 10 min using a rotating mixer, and air-dry for subsequent LMDFM imagery.\n\tNOTE: Inter-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) are assessed from eight replicates of the same sample. Samples that exhibit CVs >20% are considered non-informative and should be repeated, if there is sufficient sample.",
    "6. DFM Image Capture\nCapture images for exosome quantification under consistent lighting using a digital camera attached to a microscope equipped with a dark-field condenser (1.2 < NA < 1.4) and a 4x objective employing a 1/220 s exposure time.\nOpen the image capture software.\n\tNOTE: We use NIS-Elements microscope imaging software (see Table of Materials) for the protocol described below, but it is possible to use another software that can match its image capture parameters. NIS-Elements Viewer imaging software is a free standalone program to view image files and data sets that contains analysis, visualization and archiving tools. The parameters below are also for a microscope with autofocus and an automated stage that permits multiple images to be automatically captured and stitched into a single image.\nPlace the slide upside down on the microscope stage, adjust the slide position and apply a small drop of immersion oil on the back of the slide, where the condenser lens contacts the slide.\nClick the live button in the software interface, and adjust the exposure time against a high concentration standard well to ensure the image is not saturated.\nOpen the Scan Large Image window from the Acquire tab and set the software interface parameters as follows: Macro Image Optical conf = current; Objective: 2:10x, Scanning Optical conf = current, Objective: 2:10x; Stitching Overlap = 20%; Stitching via = Optimal Path.\nChoose Create Large Image, Close active shutter during stage movement, Wait before each Capture: 20 ms, Focus manually at start, and Use step-by-step focus every 20 field. These setting will be saved with the scanned images.",
    "Move the microscope stage to define the left top right bottom limits of the target scan field. Adjust the focus to achieve a clear image on the monitor and adjust the condenser settings and environmental lighting as necessary to minimize any lighting irregularities in the focused image.\nName the image output file in the software. Click the Scan button and allow the microscope to scan and create and save a stitched image of the entire slide.\nOpen the saved image with the image capture software you are using and save it at 1/8 scale for subsequent analysis on the DSM plugin in ImageJ.\n7. DFM image analysis\nDownload the ImageJ program (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/). Install the DSM algorithm plugin into ImageJ using the instructions listed at https://imagej.net/Plugins#Installing_plugins_manually.\nOpen the ImageJ software, then set the following input parameters within the DSM algorithm: Contour threshold (Ct) = 253.020, Type = Red, Center scale (S) = 0.8, Low (Lt)/High (Ht) quantification limit = 0/62.\nOpen the saved image from section 6.8 with ImageJ. Choose the DSM Scan button from the Plugins tab, then define the number of columns and rows according to the opened image. The program can recognize the detecting areas and analysis the scatter intensity of nanoparticle in according areas automatically. Set the following input parameters within the DSM Scan window: Resize Percentage = 25, Spot Diameter (in pixels) = 190 – 200, Diameter Range = 32, Increment diameter (in pixels) = 8, DSM Configuration - Low limit = 0, High limit = 62, Adjacent Distance = 100, Subtract Bias = 0.\n\tNOTE: The results of scatter intensity of nanoparticle reflect the quantity of bound exosomes on the slide."
