    "Print or acquire pieces 1A (Figure 1A, Supplementary Coding File 1, Supplementary Coding File 2) and 1B (Figure 1B, Supplementary Coding File 3, Supplementary Coding File 4).\nAttach double-sided polyimide tape to piece 1A and attach 1/8\" thick foam strip with one-side adhesive to piece 1B.\nAdhere the connector packaging of the device to the tape on piece 1A.\n\tNOTE: The ideal orientation of the connector on the tape will leave the shank suspended over the edge, as shown in Figure 4B.\nSecure piece 1A and piece 1B together (Figure 4C). Align the holes and secure using stainless steel screws and wing nuts (see Table of Materials).\nUsing zip ties, fasten the assembly to the vacuum desiccator tray using the holes in the bottom of piece 1A as shown in Figure 4C.\nIf applicable, place square material samples into the slits at the bottom of the frame (Figure 4D). Here, 1 cm x 1 cm square silicon wafer diced samples are used as an example.\n\tNOTE: The exact material will need to match the substrate of the treated device, which will vary depending on the device.\nComplete the gas-phase deposition by placing the solution into an appropriate receptacle within the vacuum desiccator opposite and in line with the secured assembly.\n\tNOTE: Aluminum weigh dishes were used as receptacles for the (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) deposition, as an example here.\n\t\nPlace a vacuum gauge (see Table of Materials) within the desiccator to record the exact pressure. Position the port of the desiccator lid near the secured assembly and in line with the solution (Figure 4E).\n\t\tNOTE: Further details regarding this method of gas-phase deposition are described in a previously published Reference49.\n2. Handling assembly for surface reaction via aqueous solution",
    "NOTE: The components and assembled apparatus for handling and holding devices during aqueous phase deposition and surface treatment are illustrated in Figures 5-7. The following steps will detail the procedure required to place the devices into the apparatus for deposition and treatment.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63500/63500fig05.jpg\nFigure 5: Assembly of 3D printed pieces for handling functional devices for the surface reaction occurring in aqueous solution. (A) Guide piece to be glued to the lid of the culture plate. (B) The benchtop piece was used to stabilize pieces (C) and (D) while assembling. (C) and (D) together secure the suspension of devices for placement in the well plate. (E) further secures pieces (C) and (D) to the well plate lid.

    "Construct a lid for the well plate to suspend the electrode array of the device in solution (Figure 6). This protocol describes the use of a 24-well plate.\n\t\nCut rectangular holes 19 mm x 10.5 mm into the lid of the well plate using a laser cutter or manually with a box cutter. Match the number of holes to the number of devices desired for treatment.\n\t\tNOTE: For ease of assembly, it is recommended to treat six devices per well plate, or at minimum, place holes over non-adjacent wells (Figure 6).\nPrint or acquire the appropriate number of guides (piece 2A (Figure 2A), Supplementary Coding File 5, Supplementary Coding File 6).\nUse cyanoacrylate adhesive to secure guides to the lid. Align the rectangular holes in the guides and lids while gluing to ensure the guide's rectangular hole is unobstructed, as shown in Figure 6.\nFill the well plate with the desired solution at locations where treatment will occur. For example purposes, the solution comprises EDC and Sulfo-NHS (see Table of Materials) in MES buffer.\n\tNOTE: The volume of the solution will depend on the electrode device's dimensions. For Michigan-style microelectrode arrays (see Table of Materials) with low-profile connectors of 8.6 mm and shank length of 3 mm, there is ~9 mm clearance50. Using 2 mL of solution will allow for the shank of the device to be fully submerged while keeping the remainder of the device out of the reaction solution.\n\t\nIf substrate samples are being used to confirm surface treatment, place square material samples in a well of the plate and submerge them in the reaction solution.\nSecurely suspend the devices (see Table of Materials) in a well plate. The sequence is shown in Figure 7.",
    "Tape piece 2B (Figure 2B, Supplementary Coding File 7, Supplementary Coding File 8) to a benchtop (Figure 7A).\nPlace double-sided polyimide tape to cover the base of piece 2C (Figure 2C, Supplementary Coding File 9, Supplementary Coding File 10).\nPlace 1/8\" foam tape with single-side adhesive to cover the base of piece 2D (Figure 2D, Supplementary Coding File 11, Supplementary Coding File 12).\nFit piece 2C into the groove of piece 2B (Figure 7A).\nAdhere the connector packaging of the device onto the tape, oriented, so the length of the device shank is suspended (Figure 7B).\nSecure the device by sliding piece 2D (shown in orange in Figure 7) into piece 2C. This assembly effectively secures the device between the tool pieces (Figure 7B).\nHolding the edges of the assembly, carefully lift to remove from piece 2A.\nFit the assembly into the lid by aligning the outward-facing semicircles on pieces 2C and 2D with the corresponding guides on piece 2A (shown in green in Figure 7C).\nSecure assembly placement by press-fitting piece 2E (Figure 2E) over the guides (shown in green in Figure 7D, Supplementary Coding File 13, Supplementary Coding File 14).\nFor reactions that benefit from continuous mixing of the solution, agitate the well plate. Transfer the assembled well plate to a shaker table and run at speeds under 100 rpm.\nIf multiple solution-based reactions or wash steps are desired, carefully transfer the lid to a new well plate with desired solution(s) distributed to the appropriate wells.\n\tNOTE: Step 2.4 is optional.\nRemove devices from the well plate.\n\t\nTape piece 2B to a benchtop.\nRemove piece 2E from the lid.\nCarefully remove the assembly holding the device from the well plate.",
    "Orient the assembly, so that piece 2C faces the benchtop and piece 2D faces upward. The shank of the device needs to be parallel to the benchtop. Fit piece 2C of the assembly into piece 2B as was completed previously (step 2.3.4) when fitting together the assembly.\nSeparate piece 2D from piece 2C by carefully pulling them apart. Apply slight pressure on the tabs of piece 2C into the bench to provide stability for this task.\n\t\tNOTE: The tabs of 2C are longer than that of 2D to facilitate this handling.\nUse forceps to hold onto the device's connector packaging to remove from the tape and transfer the device to the desired storage container.\nSubscription Required.
