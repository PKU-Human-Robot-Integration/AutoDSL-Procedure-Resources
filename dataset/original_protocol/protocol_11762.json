    "Human skin was obtained from patients undergoing reconstructive surgery at Castle Hill Hospital and Hull Royal Infirmary (Hull, UK) under full informed, written patient consent, institutional guidelines, and ethical approval (LRECs: 17/SC/0220 and 19/NE/0150). Non-diabetic skin was collected from patients undergoing routine surgery (mean age = 68). Diabetic skin was selected from donors who had established type II diabetes and a history of ulceration (mean age = 81). Samples from surgery were transported in holding media and processed immediately upon arrival at the laboratory. All experimental steps using unfixed human tissue were performed at Biosafety Level-2 (BSL-2) in a class II laminar flow biosafety cabinet.\n1. Preparation of skin culture media and staining reagents\nNOTE: All reagent and consumable details are provided in the Table of Materials. Ensure all reagents and equipment used for the processing and culture of human tissue are sterile. Sterilize instruments prior to the use and decontaminate with disinfectant following contact with the tissue. Decontaminate waste products in 1% disinfectant before disposal.\nHolding media: Supplement high glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 2 mM L-glutamine and 4% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic solution.\nHank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) with antibiotics: Add 4% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic solution to HBSS. Store at 4 °C until use.\nDulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (DPBS): Prepare DPBS by dissolving 9.6 g of DPBS powder per liter of distilled water (dH2O). Autoclave to sterilize and store at 4 °C until use.\nHuman skin growth media: Supplement high glucose DMEM with 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic solution and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Store at 4 °C until use.",
    "Skin fixative: To 450 mL of dH2O, add 40 mL of formaldehyde solution, 10 mL of glacial acetic acid, 4.5 g of sodium chloride and 0.25 g of alkyltrimethylammonium bromide. Store at room temperature (RT) and use within a few days.\n\tCAUTION: Fixative is hazardous (irritant and flammable). Handle with care and dispose of via an appropriate route.\nPhosphate buffered saline (PBS): Prepare PBS for whole-mount staining by adding 6 g of sodium chloride to 100 mL of phosphate buffer solution and 900 mL of dH2O.\nStaining wash buffer: Dissolve 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS.\nBlocking buffer: Add 0.2% (w/v) sodium azide and 2% (v/v) animal serum to staining wash buffer. Store at 4 °C for up to two weeks.\n\tNOTE: Block in the serum of the secondary antibody host species. Sodium azide will prevent bacterial growth during incubation.\nDAPI working solution: Prepare a 5 mg/mL stock of 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in dimethyl sulfoxide. Dilute the stock 1:1,000 in staining wash buffer to give a 5 µg/mL DAPI working solution.\nPeroxidase block: Add 0.3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide to staining wash buffer. Store at 4 °C until use. Keep in the dark to prevent decomposition.\nABC-HRP Kit:\n\t\nHRP-conjugated secondary antibody: 1 drop of biotinylated rabbit anti-goat IgG in 5 mL of staining buffer. Store at 4 °C for up to two weeks.\n\t\t​NOTE: The kit/secondary used will depend on the host species of the primary antibody.\nAvidin-biotin complex (ABC) reagent: 2 drops of reagent A and 2 drops of reagent B in 5 mL of staining wash buffer. ABC reagent should be prepared at least 30 min prior to use. Store at 4 °C for up to two weeks.",
    "Peroxidase substrate: 3 drops of reagent 1, 2 drops of reagent 2, 2 drops of reagent 3 and 2 drops of hydrogen peroxide in 5 mL of dH2O. Peroxidase substrate should be freshly prepared immediately before use and cannot be stored.\n2. Preparation of skin for wounding\nNOTE: These steps should be performed in a class II laminar flow biosafety cabinet.\nCollect the skin in holding media and transport to the BSL-2 cabinet.\nPlace the skin dermis side down within a 90 mm sterile Petri dish and remove adipose tissue with sterile scissors.\nPlace the skin in a 50 mL tube containing 25 mL of HBSS with antibiotics for 10 min at RT. Shake intermittently to remove any residual blood and adipose tissue.\nRepeat step 2.3 using a new 50 mL tube.\nPlace the skin in a fresh 50 mL tube containing 25 mL of HBSS, this time without antibiotics for 10 min at RT. Shake as in step 2.3.\nPerform a final skin rinse by placing skin in a new tube with 25 mL of DPBS. The skin is now ready to wound.\n3. Creating ex vivo human skin wounds\nNOTE: These steps should be performed in a class II laminar flow biosafety cabinet.\nPrepare the skin culture dishes prior to wounding. In a 60 mm Petri dish, stack two sterile absorbent pads and add 4 mL of human skin media via the side of the dish. Place a sterile nylon filter membrane onto the absorbent pad stack.\n\tNOTE: Skin media can be altered depending on the required treatment conditions. Up to three wound explants may be cultured on each stack.\nDry the dermal side of the skin on sterile gauze in a 90 mm Petri dish to remove residual DPBS.",
    "NOTE: This prevents the skin from sliding around when wounding.\nPlace the skin dermis side down on a clean 90 mm Petri dish lid and dab the epidermis dry with fresh sterile gauze.\n\tNOTE: It is easier to wound the skin in a Petri dish lid than the base. Subsequent work should be carried out quickly to prevent the skin drying out.\nHolding the skin taut, press a 2 mm biopsy punch against the skin and twist gently. Do not punch entirely through the skin.\n\tNOTE: Partial thickness wounds are designed to punch through the epidermis and partially into the dermis. There may be donor-to-donor and site-to-site variability in the force required to create the partial thickness wound.\nUse curved toothed tissue forceps to pick up each side of the 2 mm wound and hook curved iris scissors under the 2 mm wound to cut it out uniformly.\nBiopsy around the central 2 mm wound using a 6 mm biopsy punch to create a 6 mm explant with a partial thickness 2 mm wound in the center.\n\tNOTE: A 6 mm biopsy punch may be used to score the skin to mark out where each 2 mm wound should be. Take care not to pierce through the tissue entirely. Create wound explants in a honeycomb pattern to reduce wastage.\nPlace wound explants epidermis side up on the nylon filter membrane stack (prepared in step 3.1).\n\t​NOTE: When handling wound explants, be careful not to damage the central wound. Use small forceps and pick up each explant at opposite sides.\nIncubate wounds at 32-37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere (90-95%) for 1-7 days. Replace the media every 2-3 days.\n4. Whole-mount staining of ex vivo wounds",
    "NOTE: This section describes immunofluorescence and immunoperoxidase staining methods. Mix all reagents well before use.\nFluorescent staining method\n\t\nCollect wound explants in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes containing 500 µL of skin fixative and incubate at 4 °C overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: The fixative used in this protocol works well for the described antibodies. Optimization will be required for other antibodies. Tissue fixation longer than 24 h may lead to over-fixation.\nThe following day remove the fixative and replace with 1 mL of staining wash buffer. Biopsies can be stored in staining wash buffer at 4 °C up to 2 weeks prior to staining.\n\t\t​NOTE: For all wash buffer steps, use a serological pipette or pipette tip, taking care not to damage the wound.\nAspirate the staining wash buffer and perform one more rinse with 1 mL of staining wash buffer.\nCalculate the amount of blocking buffer required for steps 4.1.5-4.1.6 (number of samples x 300 µL = amount of blocking buffer in µL). Make extra buffer if required.\nAdd 150 µL of blocking buffer to each sample and incubate for 1 h at RT. For all staining steps, ensure each sample is sufficiently covered and that there are no bubbles covering the biopsy wound surface.\n\t\t​NOTE: This step onwards can be performed in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes or in a 48 well plate. If using a 48 well plate, incubate the wounds face down in each well.\nDilute the primary antibody in the remaining blocking buffer.\n\t\t​NOTE: Anti-mouse keratin 14 (K14) diluted 1:1,000 in blocking buffer works well. Optimize this step for use with other antibodies or multiple probes.\nAspirate the blocking buffer and add 150 µL primary antibody per well/microcentrifuge tube. Incubate wound explants in primary antibody at 4 °C overnight.",
    "The next day, aspirate the primary antibody and rinse in staining wash buffer containing 0.2% sodium azide for 1 h at RT (500 µL per sample).\nPerform three more rinsing steps using staining wash buffer (30 min per wash, 500 µL per sample).\nDilute the fluorescently conjugated secondary antibody in staining wash buffer (e.g., goat anti-mouse 488 at 1:400 dilution).\nCalculate the required amount of secondary antibody (number of samples x 150 µL = amount in µL).\nAdd 150 µL of secondary antibody to each well/microcentrifuge tube. Incubate for 1 h at RT. Perform incubation steps 4.1.10 - 4.1.16 in the dark as the secondary antibody is light sensitive.\n\t\t​NOTE: This step can be performed at 4 °C overnight if required. Optimize the concentration of secondary antibody required for adequate signal and limited background staining.\nRemove the secondary antibody and perform 3 x 30 min rinses with staining wash buffer (500 µL per sample).\nDiscard the leftover wash buffer and calculate the amount of DAPI working solution required (as per step 4.1.11).\nCounterstain each explant with 150 µL of DAPI working solution for 10 min at RT.\n\t\t​NOTE: DAPI will stain cell nuclei blue. Hoechst dye can be used as an alternative to DAPI.\nPerform two final 30 min washes with staining wash buffer (500 µL per sample). Biopsies can be stored in staining wash buffer at 4 °C in the dark up to two weeks prior to imaging.\nBrightfield staining method.\n\t\nPerform steps 4.1.1 - 4.1.3.\nQuench endogenous peroxidase activity with peroxidase block at 4 °C overnight.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is important when using an HRP-conjugated antibody to reduce non-specific background staining from the tissue. Highly vascularized tissue will contain more endogenous peroxidase activity.\nDiscard the peroxidase block and rinse twice for 30 min in staining wash buffer.",
    "Perform steps 4.1.4 - 4.1.8.\n\t\t​NOTE: Washes after step 4.1.7 are particularly important to remove sodium azide from the samples. If sodium azide is not adequately removed, it will inactivate the HRP and interfere with staining detection.\nAdd 150 µL HRP-conjugated secondary antibody to each well/microcentrifuge tube and incubate overnight at 4 °C or 1 h at RT.\nRemove the secondary antibody and perform 3 x 30 min washes in staining wash buffer.\nAdd 150 µL ABC reagent to each well/microcentrifuge tube and incubate overnight at 4 °C or 1 hour at RT.\nAspirate the ABC reagent and perform 3 x 30 min washes in staining wash buffer.\nAdd 150 µL peroxidase substrate to one explant and determine the time required to detect a noticeable color change.\n\t\t​NOTE: Choose a sample where strong staining is expected. In this case, a red ring to show the migrating epidermis (K14). 3,3'-diaminobenzidine-4, or any other appropriate chromogenic substrate, may be used as a replacement for this peroxidase substrate.\nOnce a color change is observed, remove the peroxidase substrate, and replace with 1 mL of dH2O.\nRepeat the peroxidase substrate detection for the other explants, incubating for the time determined in step 4.2.11.\nRinse all explants with 1 mL of dH2O to remove residual peroxidase substrate. Although explants may be stored up to one week at 4 °C prior to imaging, it is better to image them as soon as possible to prevent leaching of the peroxidase substrate into the dH2O over time.\n5. Imaging and quantification\nFluorescent imaging",
    "NOTE: Fluorescent imaging is performed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. However, an inverted fluorescent microscope may be sufficient for acquiring 2D images to quantify wound closure rates. When selecting secondary antibodies, ensure that the chosen fluorochromes are compatible with the excitation and emission spectra of the microscopy equipment available.\n\t\nUse a confocal laser-scanning microscope equipped with a 2.5x, 10x and 20x objective, x-y-z motorized stage, digital camera, and acquisition software. Switch on the transmitted light detector (TPMT) to allow easy visualization of each biopsy and to enable measurement of total wound closure. Alternatively, measure each wound via brightfield microscopy following fluorescence imaging.\nPlace a 60 mm Petri dish base on the imaging platform and add a thin layer (around 1 mL) of DPBS.\n\t\t​NOTE: If too much DPBS is used, the biopsy will move around during imaging. Alternatively use a 48 well plate if a plate holder is available.\nUse small tissue forceps to transfer wound explants from wells/microcentrifuge tubes to the Petri dish containing DPBS. Place the biopsy wound side down in the Petri dish.\nUse the eyepiece and fluorescent lamp to locate and focus on the wound. If bubbles are trapped under the sample in the field of view, pick up the wound with tissue forceps and reposition.\nSet up the imaging software, ensuring equal pinhole size between channels for optimum confocality. For this, check the value of one airy unit for each channel and select the largest value. Select scan speed, image quality and averaging.\n\t\t​NOTE: The fluorochromes of the conjugated secondary antibodies and the chosen counterstain (e.g., DAPI) will dictate the channels required.\nSwitch on the live acquisition software and adjust the laser power and gain of each channel to the levels required to visualize staining. Reduce background noise by increasing the digital offset.",
    "Position the wound in the center of the imaging plane.\n\t\t​NOTE: If the wound does not fill the entire image due to using a smaller objective or creating a larger wound, take a panel of images and stitch them together (manually or with a tiling function in the relevant imaging software).\nAcquire images of the wound biopsies. Use the same imaging settings between explants.\n\t\tNOTE: Higher power images will allow assessment of tissue structures and cellular marker expression and location.\nCollect serial Z stacks through the wound, especially where the tissue is not completely flat against the Petri dish. Use analysis software to collapse the Z stack into a single maximum intensity projection image.\nBrightfield imaging\n\tNOTE: Brightfield imaging of immunoperoxidase stained biopsies can be performed in multiple ways.\n\t\nInverted microscope imaging: Prepare wound explants for imaging by placing them in a Petri dish/well as described in steps 5.1.2-5.1.3. Acquire digital images under brightfield illumination on an inverted microscope equipped with a digital camera. Stitch together multiple images if required.\nWireless digital microscope imaging: Use a wireless digital microscope connected to a phone or laptop to obtain high quality images in a cost-effective manner. Place explants wound side up onto some tissue and remove any residual dH2O (or staining wash buffer) from sample storage. Position the wound explant in the center of the microscope field of view. Acquire images using the connected camera.\nQuantification\n\t​NOTE: Percentage wound closure can be quantified in any software that allows freehand shapes to be drawn and measured. ImageJ can be used to perform quantification as follows:\n\t\nOpen the image to be quantified in ImageJ software.",
    "Use the freehand shape tool to draw around the outside of the re-epithelialized wound where it meets the normal skin. Press M (or Analyze | Measure) to acquire an 'outer' area measurement.\n\t\tNOTE: The re-epithelialized wound tissue texture differs from normal skin. The images do not need to be scaled prior to this type of analysis.\nUse the freehand shape tool to draw around the open wound area. This is where the open wound meets the inside edge of the re-epithelializing tissue. Press M (or Analyze | Measure) to acquire an 'inner' area measurement.\nUse the following equation to deduce percentage wound re-epithelialization/closure:\n% Closure = (Outer Wound Area - Inner Wound Area) / (Outer Wound Area) x 100\n\t\tNOTE: Percentage area coverage of antibodies can be deduced in the same way (e.g., K14) or as a percentage of the total wound area. Percentage intensity can also provide semi-quantitative information about tissue level expression of markers of interest, while high power imaging presents expression data at the cellular level."
