Refer to steps 15–18 in the Before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] section before starting.\nIsolate 1st instar larvae of your desired genotypes from your vial/plate. Clean larvae gently by immersing and swishing them in a watch glass containing ddH2O and transfer to a clean apple juice plate.\nSet up imaging platform as shown (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/423-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Assessing muscle function through larval locomotion\n(A) Set up imaging platform, agar plate, and smartphone as indicated.\n(B) Image of optional dartboard paper used for recording final larval movement.\n(C) Setup of dartboard paper placed under agar plate.\n(D) Image of agar plate and ruler beside it to set scale during the experiments.\n(E) Place larva at the center of the plate/dart board paper and record movement.\nPlace a fresh 10 cm wide apple juice agar plate below the imaging platform (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nOptional: An additional aid to help record larval crawling data is a dartboard paper, a circular piece of paper the same size as agar plate divided into concentric circles. Each circle in the dartboard is numbered, recording how far a larva moves with respect to the dartboard can prevent further confusion when handling large numbers of larvae (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B and 3C).\nPlace a ruler/measuring tape alongside the 10 cm plate. Acquire an image of the agar plate with ruler beside it (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nNote: The ruler or measuring tape is required to set scale and measure distance traveled by the larvae in standard units (cm, mm, etc.)\nPlace larva from the first well of genotype of interest at the center of apple juice agar plate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).",
    "Note: It is not required to provide an attractant for the larvae, the larvae crawl both in the presence and absence of an attractant with no significant difference in velocities observed between the two groups.\nStart recording larval movement using a smartphone or camera for 45 s.\nNote: Choose a time period for tracking larval movement, e.g., 30, 45, 60 s, etc., based on your preferences. On selection of a time period, keep the time constant throughout all tracking experiments. We do not recommend choosing a time under 30 s as larvae often need time to acclimatize and begin moving. Allowing the larvae 2 s to acclimatize before recording their movement is beneficial.\nStop recording larval movement once 45 s is over or when the larva reaches the edge of the plate, whichever comes first.\nRemove larva from plate using paintbrush and transfer back to well 1. Transfer larva from well 2 to the plate and repeat steps 5–7 until all larvae of the genotype/plate have been recorded.\nNote: In our experiments we tracked 8–10 larvae per genotype.\nChange apple juice plate before tracking larvae from the next genotype.\nNote: As larvae crawl on the apple juice, plate they leave their tracks on the plate. Over time, subsequent larvae follow the same tracks skewing the results. Track a maximum of 8 larvae on a single plate.\nRepeat steps 4–8 till all larvae from all genotypes/plates are tracked. Place plates with larvae back at 25°C.\nAfter 24 h, isolate 2nd instar larvae and repeat steps 1–10. Repeat the process every 24 h till larvae reach late 3rd instar stage.\nNote: Day 1, 1st instar; day 2, 2nd instar; day 3, early 3rd instar; day 4, late 3rd instar.",
    "For more details on how temperature can influence development, please refer to Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/423-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Drosophila development and larval musculature\n(A) Illustration depicting the influence of temperature on Drosophila development.\n(B) Image of a heat-fixed 3rd instar larva expressing Tropomyosin-GFP with the different thoracic and abdominal hemisegments labeled. Scale bar, 100 μm.\n(C) Schematic diagram depicting muscles from abdominal hemisegments (A1–A5) of the larva when viewed externally.\n(D) Schematic diagram depicting muscles from abdominal hemisegments (A1–A5) of the larva when viewed internally.\nMuscle names are as follows: muscle position (D, dorsal; V, ventral; L, lateral) followed by orientation (A, acute; L, longitudinal; O, oblique; T, transverse); SBM, segment border muscle.\nNote: While currently there is no evidence to suggest that larval movement is affected by circadian rhythms, ensure that larval tracking occurs during the light cycle of the larva (Sawin et al., 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). It is recommended to track the larvae at the same time every day.\nOnce late 3rd instar larvae have been tracked, dissect, fix, stain, and mount each larva individually as described in Azevedo et al. (2016)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]. Examine muscle structure and count number of muscles with structural defects.\nQuantify muscle structure defects by scoring the number of defective muscles present in the larval abdominal hemisegments A2-A7 (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B–4D). The affected muscles were divided into different classes/groups based on severity of defects. The percentages of muscles affected were plotted as graphs, and statistical significance was calculated using two-way ANOVA.\nThe above experiment was repeated again using a different group of larvae. Quantification of muscle function and larval tracking analysis are explained in detail in the Quantification and statistical analysis[href=https://www.wicell.org#quantification-and-statistical-analysis] section.\nAnesthetizing larvae to visualize muscle structure at different larval stages\nTiming: 30–45 min/day × 4 days",
    "The steps below describe how to anesthetize a larva and image its musculature throughout larval development.\nIsolate 1st instar larvae of desired genotype and clean larvae gently by immersing and swishing them in a watch glass containing ddH2O.\nTransfer and place larva on the lid of 6-well plate containing Kwan Loong Medicated Oil , such that the larva is placed directly over the well containing the oil.\nNote: Ensure that the larva does not dry out on the lid. Adding droplets of water to the larva using a paintbrush can help prevent larva from drying out.\nIncubate larva in the chamber until it is anesthetized, i.e., stops moving when disturbed with a paintbrush.\nNote: Incubation times of larvae greatly vary, so need optimization. Here, we present sample incubation times experienced with a larva; e.g., 1st instar, 3–5 min; 2nd instar, 5–8 min; early 3rd instar, 10–12 min; late 3rd instar, 15 min.\nTransfer anesthetized larvae to a microscope slide containing 50% glycerol and mount with a cover slip.\nRecord orientation of mounted larva (e.g., dorsal side up or down, head and mouth left or right) and identify the hemisegments of the larval musculature to be imaged. Image hemisegment(s) and record hemisegment numbers.\nNote: While imaging, take care not to squish or squeeze the larva, as it can lead to larval death.\nAfter imaging, carefully remove coverslip from larva, remove larva, and wash gently with 1× PBS, and then with ddH2O.\nTransfer larva to clean apple juice plate until it awakens. Once larva begins moving transfer larva to the first well of larval collection plate.\nIsolate second larva and repeat steps 15–21, until all larvae of desired genotypes have been anesthetized and imaged.\nMove larval collection plate at 25°C in light-dark incubator.",
    "After 24 h isolate 2nd instar larvae and repeat steps 15–23. Repeat the process every 24 h till larvae reach late 3rd instar stage.\nNote: When imaging the same larva at successive instars, ensure that the larva is mounted in the same orientation as done for the 1st instar larva. Image the same hemisegments imaged in the 1st instar larva.\nNote: Day 1, 1st instar; day 2, 2nd instar; day 3, early 3rd instar; day 4, late 3rd instar.\nVisualizing and quantifying sarcomere structure and size from the late embryonic stage throughout the larval stages using heat fixation\nTiming: 30 min/day ×4 days\nThese steps describe how to analyze and image muscle structure analysis at embryonic and larval stages.\nSet up laying pots of appropriate genotype containing fluorescent reporter(s) (e.g., Zasp-GFP) at 25°C.\nLabel and change apple juice plates on laying pots within 20 h, keeping the old ones for embryo and larval collection.\nIsolate 1st instar larvae and distribute larvae into 3 different vials and an apple juice plate.\nNote: We isolated and transferred ∼10 larvae into each vial and apple juice plate.\nUse the remaining embryos on the plate for collection.\nPour enough water to cover embryos on plate and remove dead flies using paintbrush.\nGently disturb the embryos on the plate using a paintbrush and then transfer them to a collection basket.\nPlace collection baskets in a plate with 50% bleach and dechorionate embryos for 4 min at room temperature.\nRinse the embryos in the collection basket with distilled water repeatedly to remove any traces of bleach from the embryos.\nHeat Fixation\nEmbryos: Dip collection baskets with embryos into a water bath at 65°C for 1–2 s, ensuring that embryos are submerged in water.",
    "Larvae: Pick up larvae of any developmental stage by the tail or head using forceps and submerge into a water bath at 65°C for 1–2 s.\nMounting\nEmbryos: Transfer embryos from the collection basket to a microscope slide using a paintbrush and then spread on the slide. Mount in either halocarbon oil or 50% glycerol, and cover with a coverslip.\nLarvae: Transfer larvae onto a microscope slide containing halocarbon oil or 50% glycerol. Orient larvae such that their dorsal sides (containing trachea) are either parallel or perpendicular to the long axis of the slide, and cover with a cover slip.\nImage the embryos or larvae immediately using a microscope (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/423-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

Red box highlights the length of the line, i.e., sarcomere length which is then plotted.\n(G) Image of a larval muscle segment expressing Zasp-GFP to count number of sarcomeres using Cell counter plugin. Red box highlights the number sarcomeres counted, i.e., number of blue dots on the muscle, in a segment of the muscle.\nNote: Both embryos and larvae were imaged on an inverted LSM 700 laser-scanning confocal microscope using either the 10×/0.30 NA or 20×/0.8 NA air objectives.\nFurther analysis of muscle structure such as muscle length, sarcomere size, and number can be performed upon image acquisition.\nMuscle length\nOpen image of muscle in Fiji (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nUsing Line tool draw a line from one end of the muscle to other (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nNote: Sometimes it is difficult to determine muscle ends from a single fluorescent reporter line. Using an additional marker such as moesin-mCherry (Millard and Martin, 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]) aids in visualization of the muscle ends.\nTo register each measurement, select: Analyze> Measure (a new window will pop up when this is assessed for the first time) (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E).\nCopy all measurements into Excel, and plot graphs using wither Excel or GraphPad Prism. Statistical significance of muscle length between genotypes at different stages were calculated using multiple t tests.\nSarcomere width\nOpen image of muscle in Fiji.\nNote: To measure sarcomere width or number, it is preferable to use a fluorescent Z-disc marker such as Zasp-GFP or α-actinin-GFP (Clark and Kadrmas, 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nUsing a line tool draw a line from one Z-disc to the next Z-disc. Register each measurement by Select: Analyze> Measure. Repeat the step by drawing a line from each Z-disc to its neighbor throughout the length of the muscle (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]F).",
    "Copy all measurement values into an Excel sheet. Calculate average sarcomere size by averaging the measurements of sarcomere size from a single muscle. Repeat the above steps for subsequent muscles.\nNote: Alternatively, another option is to draw a line from one end of the muscle to the other. Register the measurement by selecting Analyze > Measure. Count the number of Z discs, i.e., sarcomere number. To calculate average sarcomere size in the muscle, use the following formula: Muscle length/Sarcomere number.\nIn our experiments, we calculated average sarcomere sizes for at least 10 different muscles from 5 different larvae.\nSarcomere number\nOpen image of muscle in Fiji.\nOpen the Cell counter plugin by selecting Plugins> Cell Counter (a new window will pop up when this plugin is selected). Select initialize option followed by Type 1 option in the pop-up window.\nBegin clicking all the Z lines within the muscle. Once all the Z lines are counted, the number next to the Type 1 option in the pop-up window indicates the number of sarcomeres.\nSelect Type 2 option and then quantify the sarcomere number in the next muscle (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]G). Once all muscles in an image are quantified, open new image and repeat above steps.\nCopy all measurement values into an Excel sheet. Calculate average sarcomere number by averaging the number of sarcomeres from different muscles. Graphs were plotted in Excel or in GraphPad Prism.\nIn our experiments, we calculated sarcomere numbers from at least 10 different muscles from 5 different larvae for each genotype. Statistical significance of sarcomere number between genotypes and/or at different stages were calculated using either Student’s t test or multiple t tests."
