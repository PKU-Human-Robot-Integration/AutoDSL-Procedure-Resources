    "Quantitation of parcel-specific axonal and dendritic lengthsGenerate the necessary PNG files with GIMP. From the original unmodified neuronal reconstruction (Recipe 1), manually segregate the axons and dendrites within each anatomical parcel. If parcel-specific information is not required, simply separate the axons from the dendrites to estimate the corresponding axonal and dendritic length (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. 2D image manipulation. GIMP is used to selectively erase axons or dendrites from the various parcels to isolate them for later analysis.Load a PDF into GIMP (e.g., File: Open “Harris-Stewart-2001-41-BrainRes-Fig2A.pdf”) (Figure 2A).Use GIMP to erase the extraneous parts of the figure (Figure 2B).Select the eraser tool from the Toolbox window.Select Hardness 100 from the Brushes window.Set the brush size to the desired size (e.g., 25) in the Tool Options windows (Figure 2B, red box).Hold down the left button of the mouse to erase parts of the figure.Save the XCF version of the erased figure that includes both kinds of neurites in all layers (e.g., File: Save As... “SCA_all_allColors_both”). IMPORTANT: The structure of the name should be preserved for the pixel count.Export the PNG version from the XCF version of the figure to the same folder (e.g., File: Export As... “SCA_all_allColors_both.png”). The PNG is selected as the file format of choice because its default background is transparent. This reduces any potential errors from accidentally counting pixels included in the background.Use GIMP to erase the axons from the figure based on the color code (axons are shown in red in Figure 2B) by repeating steps b i-iv (Figure 2C, Video 1).Save the XCF version of the figure with the dendrites in the layer of interest to the same folder (e.g., File: Save As... “SCA_SO_allColors_Ds.xcf”).Export the PNG version from the XCF version of the figure to the same folder (e.g., File: Export As... “SCA_SO_allColors_Ds.png”).",
    "Use GIMP to erase the dendrites from the figure based on the color code (dendrites are shown in black in Figure 2B) by repeating steps b i-iv (Figure 2D, Video 1).Save the XCF version of the figure with the axons in the layer of interest to the same folder (e.g., File: Save As... “SCA_SO_allColors_Ax.xcf”).Export the PNG version from the xcf version of the figure to the same folder (e.g., File: Export As... “SCA_SO_allColors_As.png”).Save the axonal and dendritic domains in distinct files for every layer and subregion to the same folder (Figure 2E and 2F).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4073/bioprotoc-11-13-4073-g002.jpgFigure 2.

Pixel count from 2D images. A custom-made MATLAB program is used to count all pixels included in the 16 color channels of an image.Place the separated images in the data folder.Open MATLAB, making sure that the current working folder is open (e.g., “dir_QuantifyNeurites_v2”) (Figure 3A1, red boxes).Run the command convert (Figure 3A1, green box).",
    "From the displayed menu, select the image to be worked on by typing the number and pressing enter (Figure 3A2).After the image is open, select the carousel mode to identify the color channels that contain pixels (Figure 3A3).Press m to choose the color channels that contain pixels (the number of pixels is displayed in brackets) (Figure 3B1).If the channel does not contain any pixels, just press the space bar to move to the next channel (Figure 3B2).Optional step: plot the image with the selected color channels to verify that the selected channels contain all of the pixels by typing p and pressing enter (Figure 3B3).A histogram with the total pixel count is displayed (Figure 3C1). The command window displays the selected channels and number of pixels.Optional step: save the images that contain the selected (Figure 3C2) and unselected (Figure 3C3) channels by typing s and pressing enter. The images are automatically saved to the output folder.Select a new image from the data folder by typing l and pressing enter.End the process by typing / and pressing enter.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4073/bioprotoc-11-13-4073-g003.jpgFigure 3.

Measuring a calibration bar in pixels. Plot Digitizer is used to measure the length in pixels of a neuronal reconstruction’s calibration bar. The X coordinates of the two ends of the calibration bar are recorded, and their difference is the final measurement in pixels.Open the original reconstruction with Plot Digitizer.Place the cursor over the start of the calibration bar and take note of the number.Do the same at the other end of the calibration bar.The difference between the numbers represents the length of calibration bar in pixels.Conversion from pixel number to length.Determine the mean neurite width by randomly selecting three locations for every neuron image, parcel, and neurite domain, measuring the branch width in pixels at each location, and averaging the three values (Video 4).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 4. Neurite width estimation. Plot Digitizer is used to estimate the widths of axons and dendrites in each layer containing portions of a neuronal reconstruction. Three examples are measured for each layer to obtain an average estimate of the neurite width per layer.Calculate the pixel length in physical units, which is simply the nominal calibration scale-bar value (in µm) divided by the measured bar length in pixels.Obtain the parcel-specific neurite length by multiplying the pixel count for that neurite in the given parcel by the physical pixel length and dividing the result by the average branch width in pixels.Correct for the artifactual flattening of three-dimensional arbors into two-dimensional images by combining the parcel-specific length, lp, with the reported section thickness, ts, using Pythagoras’ formula:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210629/20210629001837_0135.jpg whereimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210629/20210629001920_7771.jpg represents the final corrected length.",
    "Determination of the axonal and dendritic path distances (Figure 4, Video 5)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 5. Measuring somatic distance. Fiji with the Simple Neurite Tracer plugin is used to measure the length in pixels from the soma to the end of the selected axon or dendrite. Three examples are measured for each type of neurite to determine the average.Open the original file with Fiji: File – Open – File source (Figure 4A).Convert the image to binary: Process – Binary – Make Binary (Figure 4B).Open the plugin “Simple Neurite Tracer:” Plugins – Neuroanatomy – SNT (Figure 4C).Open the image in the SNT command window: File – Choose tracing image – From (Figure 4D).Trace the distance along the dendrite/axon by clicking on the soma and at the end of the segment. If the tracing does not correspond with the structure, increase the accuracy by clicking multiple times along the segment: press y, and continue tracing along the path (Figure 4E).Once the tracing is complete, move on to the next one by accepting the trace. Press F to finish the tracing.The values are estimated in pixels (Path manager window, if values are not visible: tag – Morphometry – Length), so convert them to length using the pixel/length factor (Section 3, Figure 4E).When all traces are done, save them for future reference.

    "Presented is a representative Simple Neurite Tracer console that shows one path in blue (middle), with the options to finish the path and continue tracing on the console (left), and the path manager, with all the traces that correspond to the different parcels of the original image (right). F. Shown are the menu steps to run the Hull And Circle plugin for the dendrites located in the parcel of interest (e.g., CA1 stratum oriens; green box) for the convex hull measurement. G. The Hull And Circle toolbox (left) is used to scan the current image, where the image with the delimited area is shown in green and the bottom panel shows the emerging results window.Determining the convex hull volume from 2D reconstructions (Figures 4F and 4G, Video 6)Open the generated segmented images that only contain axons or dendrites (PNG file) with Fiji: File – Open – File source.Convert the image to binary: Process – Binary – Make Binary.Open the plugin: Plugins – Shape Analysis – Hull And Circle (Figure 4F).From the new window, select the option Scan current Image or Roi (Figure 4G).A new window containing the results is generated (Hull and Circle Results, Figure 4G).Save the results: File – Save as.An image with the calculated hull volume is displayed. This image cannot be saved, but it provides information about how the resulting convex hull area was calculated (Figure 4G).Convert the area measurements from pixel units to µm2 and multiply the resulting values by the reported slice thickness, assuming that the reconstruction is located in the middle of the slice.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 6.

    "Determining the convex hull volume from 3D reconstructionsDirectly estimate the real volume using the 3D Convex Hull plugin.Calculating the average number of synapses per neuronal pair.Calculate the average number of synapses per pair of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, Ns, from their parcel-specific axonal and dendritic lengths, by separately estimating the number, Nsx, of axonal-dendritic overlaps in each parcel x (Tecuatl et al., 2021). For any x, the value Nsx can be derived as the product of three factors:The probability that presynaptic and postsynaptic elements occur within a given interaction distance, r, is the ratio between the volume of the interaction sphere, within which the two elements are found, and the volume of the entire parcel, Vx (Recipe 2).The number of presynaptic elements (axonal boutons) in a given anatomical parcel is specified by the presynaptic axonal length in parcel x, Lax, divided by the average distance between consecutive presynaptic boutons, bd (Recipe 3; example files are accessible at hippocampome.org/php/data/Bio-protocol_sample_files.zip).The number of postsynaptic elements (dendritic spines or shafts) in the same parcel is given by the postsynaptic dendritic length in x, Ldx, divided by the distance between postsynaptic elements, sd.To calculate the average number of synapses per pair of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in a specific parcel, use the following formula:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210629/20210629002551_5083.jpg The total count of synapses per directed neuron pair, Ns, is just the sum of the number per parcel, Nsx, over all parcels.Calculate the number of contacts per connected pair.Assume that a given pair of neurons forms at least a single synaptic contact, and calculate the expected number of additional contacts for that pair as:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210629/20210629002637_7686.",
    "jpg where the volumetric ratio between the sphere defined by the radius of interaction r and Vo represents the chance of an encounter for any given pair of axonal boutons and dendritic spines or shafts, and Lax/bd and Ldx/sd correspond, respectively, to the number of axonal boutons and dendritic spines or shafts in parcel x.Determine the volume of the intersection, Vo, by:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210629/20210629002716_9916.jpg where Vdx and Vax are the dendritic and axonal convex hull volumes in parcel x.Calculate the overall number of contacts per connected pair as the sum of the contacts in each parcel augmented by one, reflecting the initial assumption that the neuronal pair is connected:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210629/20210629002756_9688.jpg where the symbol Σx represents the sum over all parcels.Calculate the connection probabilitiesCompute the connection probability for a pair of neuronal types in parcel x by dividing the average number of synapses per neuronal pair by the number of contacts per connected pair in the same parcel:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210629/20210629002830_0436.jpg Determine the overall probability of connection for a pair of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons in any parcel by the sum of inclusive events:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210629/20210629003040_8302.jpg where the symbol Πx represents the product over all parcels.Table 1.
