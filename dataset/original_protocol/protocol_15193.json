Pre-surgical Steps\nPrior to surgery, the rats are housed under a 12:12 light/dark cycle with free access to water and rodent chow.\nAnesthesia is induced with 4% isoflurane in 100% O2 gas mixture in an induction chamber until the rat no longer withdrawals to rear paw pinch. \nAseptic technique should be maintained during this procedure including use of sterile gloves, sterile surgical instruments, and a sterile surgical drape11. \nThe crown of the head is shaved with electric hair clippers.\nThe rat is placed in the prone position on an absorbent pad lying on a temperature-controlled operating surface (thermal blanket).\nThe head is placed in the stereotactic apparatus starting with placement of the gas anesthetic face mask.\nNext, the ear bars are inserted and tightened. \nDuring the procedure anesthesia is maintained with 2% isoflurane in 100% O2 gas mixture.\nLubricant ophthalmic ointment is applied to both eyes, and the eyelids are closed to prevent eye desiccation during the surgical procedure. \nA rectal temperature probe is inserted to maintain a constant animal core temperature of 37±0.5 °C.\n  \nWith the head held firmly in the stereotaxic device, the surgical area is cleansed with alternating 2% chlorhexidine and saline three times. \n2. Surgical Steps",
    "Using a scalpel, a midline incision is made on the skin overlying the calvarium from the most caudal aspects of the eyes (nasion) to between the ears (superior nuchal line).    \nThe skin is then retracted laterally with 3 bulldog clamps. \nConnective tissue is removed from the skull using dry cotton swabs so that multiple structures can be seen clearly.  These include bregma, the coronal suture, and the right lateral skull ridge. Cotton swabs are used to remove blood from the surgical field.\nUsing the surgical microscope, bregma is located, and the stereotaxic manipulators are adjusted until the 1.0 mm round drill bur is zeroed at bregma. \nThe drill bur is then moved to 1.6 mm anterior and 5.2 mm lateral to bregma. \nA bur hole that penetrates the skull is drilled for cannula placement (Figure 1). Excess debris and blood are continually cleared using cotton swabs. \nAt this point, a guide cannula can be inserted (step 7) or a direct ET-1 injection through the bur hole can be performed (proceed directly to step 16).  \nNext, bur holes for 3 mounting screws are drilled through partial thickness of the skull using a 1.0 mm inverted cone drill bur (Figure 1). One hole is drilled in each frontal bone about 1-2 mm anterior to the coronal suture and 1-2 mm lateral to the sagittal suture.  One hole is drilled in the parietal bone about 2-3 mm posterior to the coronal suture and 2-3 mm lateral to the sagittal suture ipsilateral to the guide cannula bur hole. Three 0-80 x 3/32 mounting screws are placed in these bur holes and will provide support for the cement holding in the cannula.  The screws should only be advanced 2 or 3 turns so as not to damage the dura matter.",
    "The guide cannula is placed in the stereotaxic cannula holder and bregma is located. \nThe stereotaxic manipulators are adjusted until the guide cannula is zeroed at bregma.  The cannula is moved to the bur hole located 1.6 mm anterior and 5.2 mm lateral to bregma. \nFinally, the guide cannula is lowered into the bur hole with the final tip position of 4.5 mm ventral to bregma. \nLaser Doppler flow probe placement (optional)    \n    \n In order to monitor cerebral blood flow using LDF, a probe holder can be placed into position prior to affixing the guide cannula with dental cement.        \nThe probe holder base is trimmed flush with the pedestal except for small wedge shaped tab. \n The probe holder is then placed posterior to the guide cannula and just medial to the lateral skull ridge with the tab oriented medially (Figure 1).        \nThe probe holder and guide cannula are affixed together using dental cement. \nDental cement is then used to secure the cannula in place. The cement is in contact with all three screws and surrounds the entire base of the cannula. \nThe cement should be completely dry prior to removal of the cannula holder.  This takes about 5 min. \nAfter these steps, the surgical incision can be closed and the cannula dummy can be screwed into the guide cannula. Alternatively, ET-1 induced MCAO can be performed on the rat after a period of recovery from the cannula implantation surgery. For this method, step 19 should be performed next and steps 14-18 can be performed at a later time. To perform guide cannula implantation and ET-1 injection during the same surgery, step 14 should be performed next. \nThe infusion syringe is loaded with ET-1 (diluted to 80 μM in PBS) and then mounted in the stereotaxic injector.",
    "The stereotaxic manipulators are adjusted until the needle tip is zeroed at the rim of the guide cannula.\nThe needle tip is lowered through the guide cannula to a position of 17.2 mm ventral to the rim of the guide cannula. If a guide cannula is not used, the needle tip is zeroed at bregma and lowered through the bur hole to a position 8.7 mm ventral to bregma. \n3 μl of 80 μM ET1 is infused at a rate of 1 μl per min.\nThe syringe is left in place for 3 min after the infusion is complete and then slowly removed. \nThe incision is closed with 3.0 nylon suture and the cannula dummy is screwed into the cannula.\nA dose of appropriate analgesic (i.e. buprenorphine at 0.05-0.1 mg/kg) should be used after the surgery to minimize pain and discomfort during the recovery period.\nThe rat is removed from the surgical suite and placed in a warm, dry recovery area to prevent hypothermia, with free, easy access to soft food and water.\nSubscription Required.
