    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of cell culture\nTiming: 2–3 days\nYeasts were typically stored in glycerol stock at −80°C, and this step explains how to revitalize frozen cells in preparation for live-cell imaging.\nStreak out the strain(s) of interest on YPD plates. Incubate them for 1–2 days at 25°C or 30°C.\nNote: Use YE5S plates for fission yeast.\nNote: Cells on rich media can survive for 3–4 weeks at 4°C. To prevent the plates from drying out, they should be sealed with parafilm. Minimal media are not recommended for storage purposes because cells on such media are prone to lose viability more quickly.\nA day before the planned imaging, inoculate cells from a single colony on the plate (step 1) into 4 mL of SC liquid medium in a test tube (16 × 150 mm, round bottom) and shake them at 25°C for 6–8 h in a water bath shaker (at 210 rpm).\nNote: For fission yeast, we use 8 mL of YE5S liquid medium in a test tube (25 × 120 mm, flat bottom).\nCritical: YPD liquid medium should be avoided for imaging purposes due to its high background of autofluorescence.\nOptional: As an alternative, make a thin cell patch on a fresh plate from a single colony and then incubate at 25°C. This also works sufficiently well.\nTransfer preculture (inoculation volume needs to be calculated, see note) to 4 mL of SC medium in a test tube (16 × 150 mm, round bottom) and shake them at 25°C overnight for 12–16 h in a water bath shaker (at 210 rpm). Cells are cultured until they reach the mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.3–0.7, 0.4–1 × 107 cells/mL).",
    "Note: For fission yeast, we use 8 mL of YE5S liquid medium in a test tube (25 × 120 mm, flat bottom).\nNote: Use the spreadsheet to calculate the inoculation volume (See Table S1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/942-Mmc1.xlsx])\nOptional: To increase the likelihood of capturing cells at the right phase of growth for imaging, prepare multiple cultures by serial dilution to gain a broader range of cell density at the time of collection.\nLive-cell imaging\nTiming: 3–4 h\nThis step explains how to prepare the sample and acquire time-lapse images.\nSample preparation\nTransfer 1 mL of mid-log culture to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: Use a low retention tube for harvesting cells because cells in a minimal medium tend to adhere to the tube's inner wall and are not pelleted efficiently in a regular tube.\nDeclump cells by sonication for 5 s at 15% power (Q55, Qsonica).\nNote: The sonication step can be skipped if cells do not form aggregates.\nConcentrate cells by centrifugation (8,000 × g) and remove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet to 150 μL fresh SC medium.\nNote: Use YE5S medium for fission yeast.\nPlace the entire cell suspension to the Con A/Lectin-coated glass-bottom dish.\nMount the dish on the microscope stage and incubate 5–15 min to sediment the cells. During cell sedimentation, check the cell density on the glass bottom occasionally by microscope. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]\nWhen the cell density reaches an appropriate level (see details below), gently remove the supernatant and wash cells with 200 μL fresh SC medium. Repeat the wash step 2–3 times to get rid of floating and unattached cells. Gently remove the supernatant and add 1–1.5 mL of SC medium.\nNote: Use YE5S medium for fission yeast.\nNote: While changing medium, leave a small amount of supernatant to prevent cells from drying out.",
    "Note: Indicated medium volume (1–1.5 mL) is for a single chamber in the 4-chamber 35 mm dish (D35C4-20-1.5-N, Cellvis). If you use a regular non-chambered 35 mm dish, add 4–5 mL to provide cells with sufficient nutrition.\nCritical: We prefer the cell density at 50–70% field coverage by cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Overcrowded fields (90–100% field coverage, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) should be avoided because the cell-free area will be used as a background reference in the following data analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/942-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Examples of cell densities in a microscopic field for imaging in budding yeast\n(A) A field of cells at an appropriate density for analysis (50–70% coverage).\n(B) A field of cells at an excessive density for analysis (90–100% coverage).\nOptional: We recommend this preparation method because it is simple and does not require special equipment or reagents. This method can keep cells healthy for prolonged imaging times (>2 h) and allows for drug perfusion. There are many alternative ways to prepare specimens for live-cell imaging, e.g., using an agarose pad (Okada et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). If you need special conditions, such as accurate temperature regulation, you should select the appropriate method for your experiment (Babic et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]).\nTime-lapse imaging\nThese are typical settings for our routine imaging (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]). The conditions should be adjusted to be appropriate for the protein of interest and your imaging system.
