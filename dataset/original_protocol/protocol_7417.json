  "procedures": [
    "Cell culture Grow MH-S cells inside of a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 at 37 °C in complete RPMI growth medium (see Recipes) to 90% confluency in a 100 mm dish.Remove the culture media and wash the cells with 10 mL of PBS 1×.After removing the PBS, add 2 mL of trypsin/EDTA solution to detach cells, incubate in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 5 min at 37 °C, and add 8 mL of complete RPMI growth medium to stop the reaction.Note: Temper the growth medium and trypsin solution at 37 °C in a water bath.Collect the cells and centrifuge at 423 × g for 5 min. Remove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of complete RPMI growth medium.Calculate the cell concentration using an automated cell counter.Seed MH-S cells in 35 mm μ-dishes (3 × 105 cells per dish) in 1.5 mL of complete RPMI growth medium.Note: Remember to seed additional dishes for control condition (see step B3). Incubate cells at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 overnight.Temper the starving medium (see Recipes) at 37 °C in a water bath.Change the cells to tempered starving medium and incubate under the same culture conditions for approximately 3 h.BSA-oleate treatment Defrost an aliquot of BSA-oleate monounsaturated fatty acid complex (5 mM) in the water bath for 2 min.Prepare the BSA-oleate working solution at 100 µM in starving medium.Note: For 1.5 mL of medium, you need 60 µL of BSA-oleate monounsaturated fatty acid complex.Change the starving medium to starving medium + BSA-oleate (100 µM) or starving medium + BSA for the control.Prewarm the stage of the 3D Cell Explorer microscope to 37 °C at least 30 min before starting the acquisition.",
    "Place the plate in the 3D Cell Explorer microscope stage where the incubation conditions (37 °C and 5% CO2) will be maintained during the rest of the experiment.Note: Other holotomographic microscopes can also be used. Image acquisition This protocol is customized for a 3D Cell Explorer microscope equipped with a 60× magnification dry objective (λ = 520 nm, sample exposure 0.2 mW/mm2) and a depth of field of 30 μm.Proceed to capture images every minute for 18 hours, using the Steve software that controls the microscope.Each image provides a reconstruction of 30 μm in the z-axis, which corresponds to 100 images. Most of the images from the 100-image stacks are in fact out of focus, because samples are only visualized in a small range in the z-axis (around 5–10 stacks). From the whole z-stack, select at each time point the z-image in which the focus and resolution of the cells is best observed. LD are observed as intracellular spheres that have a high RI.Export the image using Steve software to transform RI volumes into .tiff format. Pictures are exported by default as 32-bits images.Process the exported image (.tiff format) using the FIJI software for performance purposes. Transform images to 8-bits and adjust gamma, brightness, and contrast identically for compared image sets using Fiji software.An example of time-lapse refractive images of LD in alveolar macrophages (MH-S cells) is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4629/bioprotoc-13-05-4629-g001.jpgFigure 1. Time-lapse refractive images of lipid droplets (LD) in alveolar macrophages (MH-S cells). Images show LD accumulation in MH-S cells treated with oleic acid (green) compared to control condition (blue). Close-up images shown at the right column correspond to the position indicated in the small squares."
