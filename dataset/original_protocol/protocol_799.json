    "**Long-term culture of human brain organoids**\n_Thawing human pluripotent stem cells \\(hPSCs)_\nMaintain hPSCs in mTeSR medium in feeder-free 10 cm tissue culture dishes coated with Geltrex membrane.\n1. Coat a 100 mm tissue culture dish using a 1% Geltrex solution in DMEM/F-12; hold prepared Geltrex on ice until transfer to the dish. \n  2. Place coated dish in a 37°C incubator for at least 30 minutes. \n  3. Thaw cells by placing cryovial in 37°C water bath \\(for preparation of the cryovial refer to section “freezing hPSCs”). \n  4. Immediately transfer contents to a 15 mL conical tube containing 4 mL of pre-warmed mTeSR to dilute freezing medium. Minimize pipetting of thawed cells.\n  5. Centrifuge at 200 g for 4 min. Aspirate the supernatant. Gently resuspend the pellet in mTeSR with ROCK inhibitor \\(12.5 μM).\n  6. Transfer to coated 100 mm tissue culture dishes and culture in a 37°C incubator. \n  7. Replenish the medium daily by completely aspirating the mTeSR and replacing it with 10 mL of fresh mTesR. \n  \n_Passaging hPSCs_\n1. Passage PSCs upon 70% confluency. \n  2. Prepare a fresh 10 cm Geltrex-coated dish as described above.\n  3. Aspirate mTeSR from the culture dish and add 5 mL of Gentle Cell Dissociation Reagent \\(for a 10 cm dish).\n  4. Incubate at room temperature for 5-6 minutes. Under the microscope, colonies should appear to separate into pieces but not detach from the plate.\n  5. Aspirate reagent and add 5 mL mTeSR.\n  6. Use a cell lifter to gently scrape off colonies, using a circular motion. \n  7. Slowly triturate colonies four times using a 5 mL pipet, trying not to break up colonies. Some degree of colony splitting is unavoidable, and beneficial to the protocol. However, creating single-cell suspension should be prevented.",
    "8. Pipette off 2.5 mL of cell aggregates, transfer to a 15 mL conical tube, and make a 1:4 dilution of aggregate suspension with mTeSR. \n  8. Aspirate excess Geltrex solution from the 10 cm coated dish.\n  9. Add the 10 mL of the diluted cell aggregate suspension onto the new dish. \n  \n_Freezing hPSCs_\nFreeze cells at optimum density \\(70% confluency). Prepare an appropriate number of cryovials; plan to put the equivalent of one 10 cm plate into each cryovial. Label each cryovial with the cell line, passage number, date, operator’s initials, and culture size per vial. Place vials on ice and pre-chill the freezing container at 4°C.\n1. Dissociate colonies as in passaging protocol \\(steps 1- 7) and collect into a 15 mL conical tube.\n  2. Centrifuge at 200 g for 4 minutes.\n  3. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 0.5 mL of ice-cold freezing media \\(90% mTESR / 10% DMSO by volume) per cryovial.\n  4. Immediately pipet cell suspension into cryovials. Immediately transfer cryovials to the freezing container and place it in a -80°C freezer.\n  5. After 24 hours, transfer cryovials to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\n  \n_Generation of embryoid bodies_\n1. Grow hPSC colonies in a 100 mm dish until 70% confluent. Colonies should have no evidence of differentiation and should display optimal features. Clusters of differentiated cells should be designated with a marker on the plate while inspecting the dish under a tissue culture microscope and then aspirated off before proceeding.\n  1. Aspirate mTeSR medium and wash plate with 3 mL of PBS.\n  2. Aspirate off PBS, then add 5 mL of Accutase and place the dish back in the incubator for 10 minutes.",
    "3. Cells should detach from the plate. Use a pipettor fitted with a P1000 pipette tip to triturate and wash the plate to detach the remaining cells.\n  4. Add cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube with 5 mL pre-warmed mTESR.\n  5. Triturate up and down with a P1000 pipette a few times to ensure a single-cell suspension. \n  6. Use a hemocytometer to count a sample of the hPSCs. \n  7. Meanwhile, centrifuge cells at 200 g for 3 minutes. Aspirate and resuspend cells in 5 mL of embryoid body medium \\(EBM). \n  8. Add a volume of the single-cell suspension to a tube of 15 mL of EBM so as to create a suspension with 2,500 cells per 150 μL of EBM. \n  9. Pipet hPSC suspension into a reservoir. \n  10. Using a multichannel pipette, add 150 μL of cell suspension into each well of a low-attachment, round-bottom 96-well plate. \n  11. Replenish EB medium every 48 hours by removing 75 μL of EB medium from each well and adding 150 μL of fresh EBM. Include Rock inhibitor \\(50 μM) and bFGF \\(4 ng/mL) in the EBM medium for the first 4 days. \n  **Tip:** Before removing the 75 μL of EB medium, gently agitate the medium to remove debris accumulated around the embryoid body \\(typically due to cell death). To agitate, use a multichannel pipette set at 30 μL and gently pipette up and down. To prevent the debris from resettling at the bottom of the wells, resuspend and change media for the first six columns of the 96-well plate before proceeding to the next six.\n_Neural Induction_",
    "1. The development of the organoids is counted from the day of EB seeding \\(Day 0). On Day 6, transfer EBs from low-attachment, round bottom 96-well plates to intermediate induction medium \\(IIM) in low-attachment, flat-bottom 24-well plates. \n  a. Fill each well of the 24-well plates with 500 μL of IIM. \nb. To avoid disrupting the EBs, use a cut 200 μL pipette tip to individually transfer each EB to a well of the 24-well plate. \n2. On Day 8, add an additional 500 µl of Neural Induction Medium \\(NIM) to each well.\n  \n_Embedding in Matrigel_\n1. On Day 10, thaw Matrigel at 4°C and keep on ice for the rest of the procedure. \n  2. Use Parafilm to make a grid of indents on which to shape the Matrigel droplets. \n  a. Cut a piece of Parafilm using sterile scissors. Spray Parafilm with 70% ethanol before placing it in the tissue culture hood. \nb. Stretch the piece of Parafilm over an empty tip tray for 200 µL sized tips. \nc. Use a gloved finger to push the Parafilm partway into the holes in the tip tray, creating dimples in the Parafilm sheet. Make sure each dimple is a smooth hemisphere. \nd. Detach the Parafilm sheet from the empty tip tray and use sterile scissors to cut it into 4x4 dimple sheets. Place one 4x4 dimple Parafilm sheet in each 60 mm tissue culture dish. \n3. Use a cut-tip 200 μL pipette set at 35 μL to individually transfer each tissue from the low-attachment, 24-well plate to a Parafilm dimple. Use an uncut 200 μL pipette to aspirate off most of the medium used in transferring the tissues, leaving the tissue surrounded by minimal medium.",
    "4. Add 35 μL of thawed Matrigel to each dimple. Immediately after adding the Matrigel droplet, gently reposition each tissue in the middle of the Matrigel droplet using a pipette tip. Complete embedding as soon as possible after aspirating off excess medium in step 3 to avoid drying out the tissue.\n  5. Place the dish back in 37°C incubator for 20 minutes to allow the Matrigel droplets to solidify. Then rinse each Parafilm sheet holding the tissues with 5 mL CDM without vitamin A. If necessary, use sterile forceps to dislodge the Matrigel droplets from the Parafilm sheet. Remove the Parafilm sheet and make sure each tissue is completely enveloped in a Matrigel droplet. Otherwise, repeat steps 3-5 for any organoids that failed to be completely embedded. \n  6. Place dish with organoids back in incubator and continue culturing. \n  7. On Day 12, replace the CDM in each dish by aspirating off the medium and adding 5 mL of fresh CDM without vitamin A. \n  \n_Transferring to spinner flasks and long-term culture_\n1. On Day 14, use a 50 mL pipette to gently transfer the tissues to a 125 mL spinner flask containing 80 mL of CDM with vitamin A. Transfer up to 40 organoids per spinner flask. Maintain cultures on a magnetic stirrer set at a speed of 35 rpm. \n  2. Replenish the medium once every six days by completely aspirating the medium and adding fresh CDM with vitamin A. \n  3. On Day 30, add freshly-reconstituted brain-derived neurotrophic factor \\(BDNF) to the flask at a concentration of 14 ng/mL. From this point on, use media with BDNF to change the media every 6 days.",
    "**Tip:** When changing media, remove the cap from one of the arms of the spinner flasks to reach an aspirating pipette into the flask; avoid removing the main top cap of the spinner flask as a preventative measure against contamination. \n**Tip:** Make sure to remove any debris that may accumulate over time around the paddle of the flask, using an aspirating pipette. Check the caps periodically and replace caps if necessary. Periodically replace the spinner flasks as needed. \n_Single-cell dissociation of brain organoids for droplet sequencing_\n1. Transfer one organoid from the spinning bioreactor into a 60 mm cell culture dish containing 5 mL of prewarmed Worthington papain solution \\(PAP2) with 250 μL of Worthington DNase solution \\(D2). \n  2. Cut the organoid into small pieces with a blade.\n  3. Place the 60 mm dish that contains the tissue onto a digital rocker in a primary cell culture incubator, and incubate with rocking speed set at 27 rpm for 60 minutes at 37°C.\n  4.  Collect digested tissues into a 15 mL tube and add 5 mL of RT EBSS.\n  5. Triturate the mixture with 10 mL plastic pipette 20 times, by pipetting up and down. Allow any pieces of undissociated tissue remaining after trituration to settle to the bottom of the tube.\n  6. Carefully transfer the cloudy cell suspension to a 15 mL tube. Be careful to avoid including any pieces of undissociated tissue.\n  7.  Add 2.7 mL of EBSS, 3 mL of reconstituted Worthington inhibitor solution \\(OI.BSA), and 250 µl DNAse solution to the 15 mL tube with the tissue. Mix gently, avoiding bubbles.\n  8. Pellet cells by centrifuging at 300 g for 5 minutes at room temperature.\n  9. Resuspend cells in 1 mL of ice cold neurobasal medium, and filter through a 20 μm Nitex mesh.",
    "10. Count cells using trypan blue. \n  11. Dilute cells in ice cold DPBS+ 0.2%BSA to a concentration of 100 cells/μL.\n  12. Place cells on ice until ready for droplet collection.\n   Total time required for dissociation: 1 hr and 45 min.\n**Electrophysiological Recordings**\n_Building the electrophysiology rig_\n1. Assemble a dark box inside the Faraday cage.\n  2. Mount the silicon probe and wire up the SmartBox system \\(Figure 1).\n  **Tip:** Accurate probe maps will need to be constructed for data analysis. We recommend that the user makes a careful note of all connections between the probe and the SmartBox. Paying close attention to the position of the FFC jumpers, the orientation of the SmartLink32 headstages relative to the AB3 breakoutboard, and port assignments at the SmartBox. \n**Tip:** During setup, mark SmartLink cables with colored cable ties, at both ends. These will help to trace wires.\n**Tip:** Use cable ties to secure the SmartLink Cables to the silicon probe mounting post. This will reduce stress on the connection between the SmartLink32 headstages and the AB3 breakout board.\n3. Assemble and position the recording chamber inside the darkbox \\(for assembly refer to Figure 2).  \n  a. Detach the floating micro-electrode array from its leads.\nb. Make some holes in the side of the PTFE teflon tube. These are required to join the inner and outer chambers \\(the inner chamber holds the organoid; the outer chamber holds the AgCl ground/ref, the bath thermistor, the carbogen line, and receives drugs). \nc. Use Kwik-Sil to:\ni. Fix the tissue culture dish to the glass slide.\nii. Mount the PTFE Teflon tube inside the culture dish. This will form inner chamber used to mount the organoid.\niii. Fix the stainless steel disks to the heating stage isolator.",
    "iv. Mount the detached floating micro-electrode array inside the inner chamber. This will be used to anchor the organoid.\nd. Make 5 holes in the culture dish lid \\(one large central hole, Ø 27 mm; four small radial holes, Ø 3 mm). Holes in the recording chamber lid are used to access the inner and outer chamber by key elements of the recording setup \\(see Figure 2c).\n4. Assemble and position carbogen manifold inside the darkbox \\(for assembly refer to Figure 6). \n  5. Assemble the organoid chute \\(see Figure 7).  \n  6. Assemble and collimate the light source \\(for assembly refer to Figure 10: the collimation procedure is described on the \"ThorLabs\":https://www.thorlabs.com/newgrouppage9.cfm?objectgroup_id=2692 website)\n  7. Position the light source over the recording chamber, and center on the organoid anchor \\(Figure 11).\n  8. Calibrate LED power with power meter and sensor \\(perform calibration in the dark).\n  9. Position the micro-manipulator and set approach angle for the silicon probes; the target is 3-4 mm above the center of the recording chambers anchor. Ensure that the approach angle does not obscure the light path \\(to avoid costly accidents we advise using dummy silicon probes during the alignment process).\n  10. Position digital microscopes. \n  11. Microscope #1 is positioned to give a bird’s eye view of the organoid; it will be used during the placement of the organoid onto the anchor. Position microsope #1 above the longpass dichroic mirror \\(item 12 in Figure 10). \n  12. Microscope #2 is positioned to view the silicon probe and organoid at high magnification; it will be used during the implantation of the silicon probe. Position microsope #2 close to the recording chamber, being careful not to obscure the light path or the approach angle of the silicon probe.\n  \n_Setting up the DAQ_",
    "1. Wire up and ground the DAQ according to the user manual \\(Neuronexus SmartBox).\n  2. Suggested amplifier settings:\n  a. Sampling rate = 30 kHz\nb. DSP cutoff frequency = 1.00 Hz\nc. Lower bandwidth = 0.1 Hz\nd. Upper bandwidth = 7.5 kHz\n3. Checklist:\n  a. Confirm all analog channels are active.\nb. Confirm the digital channels, receiving TTL pulses, are active.\n**Tip:** On-line spike detection can be facilitated by applying an additional software filter to the displayed data \\(for example, a 100 Hz high-pass filter).\n**Tip:** Set file save format appropriate for the analysis procedure. A flat binary file with no header is appropriate for analysis with Klusta software \\(for SmartBox software, this format is provided by the *.dat file option).\n**Tip:** If TTL pulses are going to be used to drive an LED, send the signal to one of the DAQ digital inputs. \n_Mount the Organoid_\n1. Prepare aCSF \\(see Reagents – Electrophysiology) and bubble with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>. Warm aCSF to 30°C in a water bath.\n  2. Position the recording chamber lid.\n  3. Position the bath thermistor, the carbogen line, and the AgCl ground/ref into the outer chamber of the organoid bath.\n  4. Turn on the heating stage.\n  5. Add 15 mL of aCSF to the recording chamber, maintaining the recording bath at 30°C.\n  **Tip:** In the described setup, the heating stage temperature is under homeothermic control, NOT the recording chamber. Therefore, the temperature of the heating stage will need to be set higher than the target temperature for the recording chamber. Make sure that you are monitoring the bath temperature.\n**Tip:** If pharmacological compounds will be added to the chamber during the experimental protocol, accurately record the total volume of aCSF dispensed into the bath during this and subsequent steps.",
    "6. In the culture room, transfer the organoid from the culture media into a tube with prewarmed aCSF \\(bubbled with 95%O<sub>2</sub>/5%CO<sub>2</sub>). \n  **Tip:** Exposure of the organoid to light should be avoided.\n7. Move the organoid chute into position over the organoid anchor, and lower into position. \n  **Tip:** IR digital microscope #1 can be used to visualize the chute and anchor.\n8. Turn off the room lights, and put on the night vision goggles.\n  9. Use a pipette to gently drop the organoid down the chute.\n  **Tip:** While raising the tissue chute using the manipulator, pipette a few drops of aCSF down the chute. This will help to secure the organoid onto its anchor.\n10. Let the organoid acclimatize for 30 minutes at 30°C. \n  11. Over a further 30 minutes, slowly raise the temperature of the recording chamber to 36°C.\n  \n_Implanting the Silicon Probe_\n1. Position the silicon probe over the recording chamber.\n  2. Connect the recording chamber AgCl ground/ref to the headstage.\n  **Tip:** There are alternative connectors on the breakout-board; these are closer to the chamber and require a shorter jumper wire.\n3. Seal the dark box and turn on the room lights.\n  4. Submerge the silicon probe into the aCSF.\n  5. Measure the probe impedance at 1000 Hz in aCSF. \n  **Tip:** These values should be recorded before and after the experiment, and used to remove bad channels from analysis.\n6. While viewing the organoid and silicon probe tip on IR digital microscope #2, position the probe tip over the organoid using the three orthogonal axes \\(x, y, z) of the micro-manipulator.\n  7. Zero the axes distance counter on the micro-manipulator controller.\n  8. Implant the probe into the organoid.\n  **Tip:** During implantation, set the micro-manipulator speed to slow.",
    "**Tip:** To avoid stress to the silicon probe shaft and organoid, the probe should be advanced along the axis of the silicon shaft. This can be done by using the 4<sup>th</sup> virtual “approach” axis of the micro-manipulator.\n9. While advancing the silicon probe, use the micro-manipulator controller to monitor the distance advanced along the approach axis.\n  10. Adjust the probe position until spikes are isolated.\n  11. Acquire spontaneous activity.\n  12. Trigger light stimulus by sending TTL pulses to the LED driver.\n  \n_Analysis_\n1. Generate a probe map for the recording set up.\n  2. Identify the probe channels with either a high or low impedance. Remove these defective probe sites from the list of channels to be analyzed.\n  3. Process the raw data file\\(s) using spike detection and clustering software designed for high density microelectrode arrays, Klusta<sup>5</sup>."
