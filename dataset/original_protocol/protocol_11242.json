    "This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the University of California San Diego (UCSD) Institutional Review Board (IRB). IRB #090401 Approval was received from the UCSD Institutional Review Board (IRB) to collect surgical specimen from patients for research purposes. An informed consent was obtained from each patient and a surgical bone prostate cancer metastasis specimen was obtained from orthopedic repair of a pathologic fracture in the femur. Animal protocols were performed under the University of California San Diego (UCSD) animal welfare and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved protocol #S10298. Cells from mechanically and enzymatically dissociated patient tumor tissue were intra-femorally injected into 6 to 8 week old male Rag2-/-;γc-/- mice as previously described17. Xenograft tumor volume was determined using an in vivo bioluminescence imaging system and caliper measurements. Upon tumor growth up to 2.0 cm (the maximal allowable size approved by IACUC), the tumor was harvested for 3D organoids establishment.\nNOTE: Figure 1 shows the workflow for establishing 3D Organoids and a protocol number for each step of the experimental procedures.\n1. Processing of patient derived xenograft (PDX) tumor tissues\nNOTE: This is an initial step for organoid establishment for a tumor derived from a xenograft mouse model. This protocol is adapted from a previous publication by Drost et al.5 and we have modified the media conditions to include serum supplementation to organoid media.\nProcess the tumor specimen as described below.\n\t\nMince tumor samples to 1-3 mm3 sized pieces and digest the samples with 10 mL of cell dissociation solution for 45 min at room temperature.\nTo terminate digestion, add 20 mL of DMEM complete media to the samples.",
    "Filter the suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer. Use a sterile plunger flange to push any leftover tissue on the top of 70 μm cell strainer.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.\nWash the cell pellet three times with fresh adDMEM complete media. Match the volume of media for wash and resuspension with the volume of media suggested in Table 3. For example, for a 24 well plate culture condition, the volume for the wash should be 500 µL.\n\t\tNOTE: As shown in Table 3, the protocol is applicable to different culture conditions.\nDetermine final cell counts using Trypan blue dye and a hemocytometer.\nAfter obtaining cell counts, re-suspend cell pellet in 80 µL of 2% FBS in PBS per 2 x 106 tumor cells.\nAdd 20 µL of Mouse Cell Depletion Cocktail per 2 x 106 tumor cells. Mix well and incubate for 15 min at 2-8 °C.\nAdjust the volume to 500 µL with 2% FBS in PBS buffer per 2 x 106 tumor cells.\n\t\tNOTE: Up to 1 x 107 tumor cells in 2.5 mL of cell suspension can be processed on one LS column.\nLoad the LS columns on the magnetic column separator and place a 15 mL conical tube on a rack underneath to collect the flow-through.\nRinse each column with 3 mL of 2% FBS in PBS buffer. Discard the conical tube with the wash flow-through and replace with a new, sterile 15 mL conical tube.\nAdd the cell suspension (up to 2.5 mL of 1 x 107 tumor cells) onto the column. Collect flow-through that will be the enriched with human tumor cells.\nWash the column twice with 1 mL of 2% FBS in PBS buffer.",
    "NOTE: It is important to perform wash steps as soon as the column is empty. Also, try to avoid forming air bubbles.\nAliquot the appropriate volume of cell suspension to a 1.5 mL tube for the desired culture set up (Table 3).\nCentrifuge the 1.5 mL tube at 300 x g and 4 °C for 5 min.\nCarefully remove and discard the supernatant.\n2. Processing of patient primary tumor tissues\nNOTE: This is an initial step for organoid establishment.\nFollow all of step 1 except the mouse cell depletion process, which is not necessary for processing of patient primary tumor tissues.\n3. Forming an attached round dome on the plate\nNOTE: This manuscript describes three ways to make a dome from a mixture of the cell pellet and the basement membrane (e.g., Matrigel) as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. In Steps 2-4, the cells and the basement membrane should be kept on ice to prevent solidification of the basement membrane.\nResuspend the cell pellet in the appropriate volume of basement membrane (e.g., 40 µL) for a 24 well plate set up (Table 3).\nPipette up and down gently to ensure that the cells are re-suspended well in the basement membrane.\nPipette the appropriate volume (Table 3) of the cell-basement membrane mixture (and optional 10 µL of adDMEM complete media) into the center of the pre-warmed tissue culture plate.\nInvert the plate and immediately place the plate upside down in the CO2 cell culture incubator set at 5% CO2, 37 °C for 15 min. This prevents cells from settling and adhering to the plate bottom while allowing the basement membrane to solidify.\nPipette the appropriate volume (Table 3) of pre-warmed medium containing 10 μM Y-27632 dihydrochloride into each well.",
    "Place the plate right side up inside the CO2 cell culture incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C).\nChange the media every 3-4 days. After 5-7 days, use culture medium without 10 μM Y-27632 dihydrochloride to maintain the cultures.\n4. Forming a floating dome from an attached round dome on the plate\nAfter step 3.7, detach the dome using a cell scraper.\n5. Forming floating beads\nNOTE: This protocol is named as floating beads since the mixture of basement membrane, media, and organoids look like beads.\nCut a 2 inch x 4 inch piece of paraffin film.\nPlace the paraffin film on the top of the divots of an empty tip-holding rack from a 1000 µL plastic pipette tip box.\nGently press down on the paraffin film to trace the divots using a gloved index finger but without breaking through the paraffin film.\nSpray the paraffin film with 70% ethanol and turn on the UV lamp in the cell culture hood to sterilize the prepared paraffin film for at least 30 min.\nPrepare a mixture of cells and 20 µL of basement membrane. Seeding density can be 50,000 - 250,000 cells per dome.\nPipette the mixture of cells processed from step 1 or 2, and 20 µL of basement membrane into the mold of the divot formed in the prepared paraffin film.\nResuspend the cell pellet in basement membrane and pipette the cell suspension in the prepared paraffin filmed divots.\nPlace the solidified beads and paraffin film into a 6-well plate. One well in a 6-well plate can fit up to 5 beads.\nPipette 3-5 mL of pre-warmed medium containing 10 μM Y-27632 dihydrochloride into each well while gently brushing beads off of the paraffin film.",
    "NOTE: As a minimum volume, 3 mL is recommended. For a maximum number of beads (N=5) per well, 5 mL of medium is recommended.\nPlace the plate inside a CO2 incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C).\nChange the organoid media every 3-4 days. After 5-7 days, use culture medium without 10 μM Y-27632 dihydrochloride to maintain the cultures.\n6. In vivo organoids image stitching using microscope8\nNOTE: Certain microscopes are unable to reach the outer perimeter of the cell plate (edge wall); therefore, we suggest using the wells close to the perimeter of the cell plate when image stitching.\nPlace the cell culture plate in an upward position into the plate holder in the Keyence microscope.\nPlace the lens on the center of the target dome.\nSet up the automatic stitching process by selecting number of the frames. For examples, 3 x 3 or 5 x 5 can be chosen to generate 9 images or 25 images total.\nPress the capture button to initiate imaging process.\nOpen the image viewer software and load a group of images taken by step 4.\nClick Image Stitching to create a high-resolution stitched image.\n\tNOTE: Capturing of serial 9 or 25 images can be performed either by manual or automatic set up to focus the cells.\n7. Organoid processing for histology: the agarose spin down method\nNOTE: This protocol is adapted from a previous publication by Vlachogiannis et al.7. We have added a step involving agarose embedding to successfully embed all populations of organoids.\nRemove existing media from the well. Be careful not to aspirate the basement membrane domes.\nAdd an equal (equal to the volume of media removed from step 1) volume of cell recovery solution and incubate for 60 min at 4 °C.",
    "Dislodge the basement membrane dome using a pipette and crush the basement membrane dome using a pipet tip. Collect the dissociated dome and cell recovery solution in a 1.5 mL tube.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g and 4 °C for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant (cell recovery solution). Save all supernatants in separate tubes until the end when the presence of organoids is confirmed in the final pelleting step.\nAdd desired volume (Table 3) of cold PBS and gently pipette up and down to mechanically disturb pellet.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g and 4 °C for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant (PBS).\nFix the pellet in a matched volume (e.g., 500 µL for one pellet from the 24 well plate culture condition, Table 3) of 4% PFA for 60 min at room temperature.\nFollowing fixation, centrifuge at 300 x g and 4 °C for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant (PFA).\nWash with matched volume (e.g., 500 µL for one pellet from the 24 well plate culture condition, Table 3) of PBS and centrifuge at 300 x g and 4 °C for 5 min.\nPrepare warm agarose (2% agarose in PBS).\n\tNOTE: Here, cell pellets for frozen sections can be directly re-suspended in 200 µL of OCT compound without further steps in Protocol 7.\nRe-suspend the cell pellet in 200 µL of agarose (2% in PBS).\n\t\nImmediately after adding agarose, gently detach the cell pellet from the wall of the 1.5 mL tube using the 25 G needle attached to 1 mL syringe. As shown in Figure 3, if the cell pellet is not physically detached from the wall of the 1.5 mL tube, then there is a risk of losing all or part of the cell pellet during the agarose embedding process.",
    "Wait until the 2% agarose in PBS is completely solidified.\nDetach the solidified agarose block from the 1.5 mL tube using a 25 G needle attached to the 1 mL syringe.\nTransfer the detached agarose block containing the cell pellet to a new 1.5 mL tube.\nFill the tube with 70% EtOH and proceed further using the conventional protocol for tissue dehydration and paraffin embedding.\n8. Histology and Immunofluorescent cytochemistry (IFC) of organoids\nSelect the slide(s) for histology or IFC.\nBefore initiating the staining process, find out where the cells are located on the slide and draw a circle around the cells on the slide using a marker.\nDraw the perimeter around the edge or boarder of the slide and where circles are located on the slide in a laboratory notebook to record their locations.\nPerform desired staining.\n\tNOTE: During this process, marked circles disappear since regular maker is not resistant to the chemicals. Even some histology permanent markers may be erased during staining process.\nAfter the staining process, place the slide over the drawing in the laboratory notebook to find the locations of cells on the slide.\nSubscription Required.
