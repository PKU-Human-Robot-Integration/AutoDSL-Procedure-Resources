    "Prepare 5-6 days in advanceCover glass cleaning and sterilizing procedure: wash the cover glass for 2 days in 100% ethanol, then repeat the wash for 2 days in Milli-Q water; dry cover glasses individually on filter paper, then place in a small glass beaker, cover with aluminum foil, then autoclave; store at RT.Check the sharpness of scissors used for decapitation by making a cut on red Theraband band.Autoclave dissection tools individually in sterilization pouches.Prepare 24 h prior culture preparationPlace 4 micro cover glasses in each tissue culture plate and coat plates with laminin-PDL coating solution (use 1 ml/35 mm dish) for at least 24 h (48 h is better) before use and place them in the water jacketed CO2 incubator.Remove the coating solution and wash the plates on the day of the culture twice with TC water (autoclaved Milli-Q water); then let them dry under the hood (if more plates are made than are needed for the culture; wrap them in parafilm and store in a 4 °C refrigerator for up to one month after coating). If using previously-coated plates stored in the 4 °C refrigerator, bring plates to RT by placing them in the biological safety cabinet; to further minimize the possibility of contamination, UV sterilize opened plates in biological safety cabinet for 15 min.Prepare on the day of culturePrepare working Dissociation Medium (DM/Ky.Mg). You will need a minimum of 60 ml per culture (store at 4°C).Prepare fresh Growth Medium with serum (sGM) before starting the neuron culture procedure.Prepare fresh Growth Medium (GM) right before starting the neuron culture procedure.Prepare Enzyme (Papain) solution right before beginning culture procedure.Prepare Trypsin Inhibitor solution right before beginning culture procedure.Macro-dissection (Figures 1 and 2)Run UV in the biological safety cabinet for 15 min.",
    "Wipe the dissection table and dissection microscopes with 70% ethanol, then place a small biohazard bag and tissue paper on the dissection table.Place autoclaved dissection tools in the biological safety cabinet.Pipette 5 ml of DM/Ky.Mg in a 60 mm Petri dish and place dish on ice.Pipette 2 ml of DM/Ky.Mg in a 35 mm Petri dish and keep this dish on ice as well.Bring newborn mice (postnatal day 0-1; P0-P1) to tissue culture room in approved containers.Note: The number of mice used for culture depends on the size of litter and the planned number of experimental conditions and the number of repeats. Spray the mouse with ethanol, then rapidly euthanize by decapitation.Using a scalpel, expose the skull by making an incision from the nasal bone to the occipital surface.Once the skull is exposed, use scissors or scalpel to make a T-shaped cut along the nasal bone and midline.Cut the skull from the starting between the eyes on the nasal bone to the occipital bone along the sagittal suture.Gently remove the parietal and interparietal bones with forceps from both sides.The brain should then become visible; use extreme caution to avoid damaging the brain tissue when removing the bone.Use the curved spatula to isolate the brain and place it immediately into the 60 mm Petri dish with ice cold DM/Ky.Mg.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3990/bioprotoc-11-08-3990-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic representation of the steps to isolate the brain (macro-dissection). After decapitation of the newborn mouse, remove the skin to expose the skull (step 1). Cut the skull along the midline using a scalpel (step 2A) and partially remove the skull using a pair of fine tipped tweezers (step 2B). Lift out the intact brain with a scalpel or spatula (step 3A) and place it into a 60 mm Petri dish containing ice-cold dissection medium (DM/Ky.Mg) (step 3B).",

Images were recorded using an AmScope SM-4TZ-144A Trinocular Stereo Microscope, equipped with an 18MP color CMOS microscope camera.Micro-dissection (Figures 3 and 4)Remove the cerebellum and separate the two hemispheres.Place the 60 mm dish with the brain in ice cold DM/Ky.Mg under the stereo microscope for the following steps.Carefully expose and remove the hippocampi; then place them into the 35 mm dish containing ice cold DM/Ky.Mg; repeat these steps for every brain used for culture.If the microscope doesn’t have a cooling function, you can perform the micro-dissection on the top of a clean 10 cm dish with ice; change the ice frequently when performing this procedure on multiple brains.Begin warming up the Papain (Enzyme) solution on the water bath with beads set to 37 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3990/bioprotoc-11-08-3990-g003.jpgFigure 3. Schematic representation of the steps to isolate the hippocampus (micro-dissection). Use a scalpel to make a coronal incision to remove the cerebellum (step 1A), then separate the two hemispheres by a sagittal cut along the midline (step 1B). Under a stereo microscope turn the hemispheres with the medial surface facing up; then expose the hippocampus by removing subcortical structures (striatum, thalamus, and brainstem) using fine tweezers (step 2). The hippocampus appears as a crescent shaped structure located below the in-folded cortex (step 3). With one tweezer clamped tight, pin down the brain by the olfactory bulb, while with another tweezer gently peel of the meninges above the hippocampus.",
    "Use fine tweezer snip along to dissect out the hippocampus (step 3). Collect the isolated hippocampi into a 35 mm Petri dish with ice-cold DM/Ky.Mg or directly into a 50 ml sterile centrifuge tube containing 10 ml of DM/Ky.Mg (step 4).

Isolated hippocampi (step 3 from Figure 3). Images were recorded using an AmScope SM-4TZ-144A Trinocular Stereo Microscope, equipped with an 18MP color CMOS microscope camera.Digestion with PapainTransfer the isolated hippocampi into a 50 ml sterile centrifuge tube containing 10 ml of DM/Ky.Mg.Wash the hippocampi 3 times with 10 ml of ice-cold DM/Ky.Mg using the Pipette-Aid; avoid touching the hippocampi with the pipette.After the 3rd wash, the DM/Ky.Mg should be kept in the biological safety cabinet at RT.Add 5 ml of warmed Enzyme solution to the 50 ml sterile tube with hippocampi and incubate for 15 min in the water bath at 37 °C.Remove the Enzyme solution, avoiding touching the hippocampi and add another 5 ml of Enzyme solution to the tube and perform another 15 min of incubation.Wash the hippocampi 3 times with 5 ml of DM/Ky.Mg.Enzyme inhibitionBegin warming up the Trypsin inhibitor solution and Optimem/Glucose solution in a 37 °C water bath.Add 3 ml of the warm Trypsin inhibitor solution to the hippocampi and incubate for 3 min in the 37 °C water bath.",
    "Repeat this step 2 more times with 3 ml of fresh Trypsin inhibitor solution.Remove Trypsin inhibitor solution and wash hippocampi 3 times with 5 ml of sGM.TriturationRemove the sGM used for washing and add 5 ml of fresh sGM.With a 5 ml pipette, pipette the hippocampi up and down about 15-30 times or until large chunks disappear and the medium becomes cloudy.Do not seal the pipette tip opening against the bottom of the tube to avoid bubbling, this leads to changes in pH; let the undissociated tissue settle (about 1 min).Transfer cell suspension into a 50 ml tube with 25 ml of warm Optimem/Glucose solution.Add 1 ml of fresh sGM to the pellet and dissociate further by pipetting up and down 10-15 times using a 1 ml pipette.Let the undissociated tissue settle (for about 1 min), then transfer the cell suspension into the 50 ml tube with 25 ml of Optimem/Glucose solution.Discard undissociated tissue, as it contains mostly tissue debris.Centrifuge the cell suspension in Optimem/Glucose for 10 min at 1,000 × g at RT in a swinging-bucket centrifuge.Carefully remove supernatant and resuspend cells in warmed up sGM.PlatingResuspend pelleted cells in warmed up sGM at 1 million cells/ml density.The yield from one newborn mouse or 2 hippocampi is 5 million cells; therefore use 5 ml of sGM/mouse to achieve a suspension at 1 million cells/ml density.Plate cultures at 1 million cells/ml density in a 35 mm Petri dish with coverslips: use 2 ml suspension/35 mm Petri dish; higher density leads to higher rate of survival and better transfection efficiency.On the second day in vitro (DIV2) replace serum containing GM with Neurobasal-B27 plus medium based GM.",
    "Transfection of primary dissociated neuron cultures with the CofActor system on DIV5:Prepare transfection solutions A and B in sterile conditions, in the biological safety cabinet:A: 100 µl Optimem + 6 µg plasmid DNA (2 µg Actin-GFP + 4 µg mCherry-Cofilin)B: 100 µl Optimem + 12 µl Lipofectamine 2000Mix solution A and B and incubate the resulting transfection mix (AB) for 15 min at RT in the biological safety cabinet.Replace conditioned medium (CM) on neuron cultures with warm transfection medium (TM); save CM.Add 200 µl of transfection mix AB/35 mm Petri dish (or 10% of the CM, if using a different size dish) and incubate for 2 h in tissue culture incubator.Spin CM at 1,000 × g for 10 min and discard pellet; place CM in incubator.After 2 h, replace TM containing AB with CM.24-48 h later, check transfection efficiency using a tissue culture microscope; transfected neurons should express both constructs (signal in green and red channels).Live cell imaging and stimulation of neurons expressing the CofActor system (Figure 5)Place glass coverslips with transfected neurons facing down into the glass bottom dish with PBS and transfer to Keyence microscope.Locate transfected neurons, mark their positions (x- and y-axis) and take images before stimulation.Treat neurons with 10 µl of 10 mM Azide and 6 µl of 6 mM DDG for 10 min without disturbing the position of the culture dish in the Keyence microscope.Stimulate neurons with blue light for 30 s without disturbing the position of the glass bottom culture dish.Return to pre-marked positions to image the neurons of interest and record their response at 1-10 min following stimulation.Note: Length of treatment and imaging is determined by user. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3990/bioprotoc-11-08-3990-g005.jpgFigure 5.

Fiji steps to measure actin/cofilin rod formation. Upload the pre-light treatment image to Fiji (A). Use the polygon out tool to cover the area of the neuron to be measured (B). Select Analyze > Analyze Particles on the Fiji control panel. Select a size of 20-200 pixel units and restrict the circularity to 0.20-1.00 (C) and press OK to analyze. With the original pre-light treatment image with the polygon still outlining it, open the post-light treatment neuron image. With the post-light treatment neuron selected press Shift > E; this will transfer the polygon made in the pre-light treatment step. Align this over the same area in the post-light treatment step (D). Then re-analyze the post-light treatment using the same steps from C."
