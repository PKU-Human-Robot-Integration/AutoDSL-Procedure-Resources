Let the magnetic beads settle down for 2.5 min at room temperature.\nRemove the magnet. In one continuous motion, invert the tube, pouring off the enriched cell suspension into a new tube.\nCount the cell numbers as described in step 6.5.\nSet up the cytotoxic reaction.\n\t\nDilute the NK cells to 5 × 105 cells/mL using the corresponding culture medium.
