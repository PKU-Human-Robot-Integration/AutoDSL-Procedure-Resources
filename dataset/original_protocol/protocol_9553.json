    "1. Filtering Solutions and Lipids\nNote: All reagents and tools used in this protocol should be as clean as possible to avoid the introduction of particulate contaminants in the samples, which can clog the LCP injector.\nFilter all precipitant solutions and molten lipids through 5 µm spin-down filters. Clean syringes thoroughly and apply compressed air to dry. Optionally, use a portable clean-room hood to prevent trapping dust particles or fibers during sample preparation procedures.\n2. Reconstitution of MP in LCP\nNote: The choice of the best LCP host lipid for crystallization depends on the target MP, and is typically identified during host lipid screening crystallization trials14. Monoacylglycerols (MAGs) represent the most common class of lipids used for LCP crystallization15. The protocols are based on using 9.9 MAG (monoolein) as the host lipid, since this is the most successful lipid for in meso crystallization to date16. 9.9 MAG can be substituted by other LCP host lipids or lipid mixtures after taking into account differences in their phase behavior. For instance, in the case of GPCRs, monoolein is typically doped with cholesterol for receptor stabilization. Here, use 9:1 (w/w) 9.9 MAG:cholesterol mixture as the host lipid.\nMix target MP, which is purified in detergent micelle solution, with the appropriate LCP host lipid using two syringes (#1 and #2) and a coupler, as described previously13.\nBriefly, load syringe #1 with the molten lipid and syringe #2 with the MP solution. Use a ratio between lipid and aqueous MP solution corresponding to the level that is just below the maximal hydration capacity of the corresponding LCP host lipid, e.g., 3:2 v/v lipid/MP solution for 9.9 MAG, 1:1 v/v lipid/MP solution for most other shorter chain MAGs (7.9 MAG, 9.7 MAG, etc.).",
    "Connect the syringes through a syringe coupler and start mixing the substances by depressing the plungers to move the mixture back and forth between the syringes, until the sample becomes homogeneous and transparent. Prepare approximately 50 µl of the LCP sample for the collection of a complete dataset by LCP-SFX. The final sample volume will typically increase by approximately a factor of two (to ~100 µl) after sample consolidation and lipid titration (Section 5).\n3. Setting up Crystallization in Syringes\nAfter a transparent and homogeneous LCP is formed, move the entire sample into syringe #2. Detach syringe #1, while keeping the coupler connected to syringe #2.\nConnect a removable needle (gauge 26s) to another 100 µl clean syringe (syringe #3) and aspirate approximately 70 µl of the precipitant solution into it. The composition of the precipitant solution that triggers formation of high-density microcrystals is unique for each target MP and should be determined before proceeding to these protocols. Here, use an optimized precipitant solution composition that yields showers of microcrystals of the A2A receptor (40 mM sodium thiocyanate, 100 mM sodium citrate pH 5, 26-28% PEG400).\nDisconnect the needle from syringe #3 while keeping the Teflon ferrule inside the syringe.\nConnect syringes #2 and #3 through the coupler, making sure that Teflon ferrules are correctly in place in both syringes. Carefully screw the coupler tightly into position.\nOrient the coupled syringes vertically with syringe #2 on the bottom and inject the protein-laden LCP sample from syringe #2 into syringe #3 slowly and steadily until the LCP string touches the plunger of syringe #3. The injected LCP volume will amount to about 1/10 of the initial precipitant volume in syringe #3 (~7 µl). Verify the volume by the scale-reading on both syringes (both plungers should move by about 7 µl).",
    "Disconnect syringe #2. The coupler now is only connected to syringe #3 that contains the sample immersed in the precipitant solution.\nUse Parafilm to completely seal syringe #3, including the plunger syringe interface, the opening end of the coupler and the needle nut. Incomplete sealing during this step can cause the precipitant conditions to change and the sample to dehydrate.\nRepeat steps 3.3-3.7 to set up crystallization in 6 additional syringes (#4-#9) utilizing a total of ~50 µl of the LCP sample (~7 µl of LCP per each syringe).\nStore sealed syringes in a plastic sealable bag with one or two fiber-free cleaning tissues pre-soaked with water to protect against sample dehydration. Seal the bag and store syringes in a 20 °C incubator during crystal growth.\n4. Crystal Detection\nRemove the syringes from the incubator to image the LCP samples directly inside the syringes (#3-#9) every 12-24 hr under a stereomicroscope with cross-polarized light. Identify crystals as tightly packed shiny particles or, in the case of smaller crystal size as a uniform glow from the LCP filament.\nReturn the sealed syringes to the bag, and store at 20 °C for future use.\n5. Sample Consolidation and Titration with 7.9 MAG",
    "Note: The lipid titration step described here serves two purposes: a) to absorb the excess precipitant solution and b) to prevent lipid freezing upon injection into the XFEL beam. When an LCP sample composed of 9.9 MAG is injected into a vacuum chamber for data collection, intensive evaporation can cool the sample down to temperatures below the equilibrium phase transition temperature (~18 °C), converting parts of the sample into a lamellar crystalline phase (Lc). These patches of Lc phase, when hit by the beam, produce intense powder diffraction rings that can damage a sensitive detector6, such as the Cornell-SLAC pixel array detector (CSPAD). Titration of 9.9 MAG sample with a shorter chain lipid (9.7 MAG or 7.9 MAG) alleviates this problem, as such mixtures have lower phase transition temperatures. Here, we describe titration of a LCP composed of 9.9 MAG with a 7.9 MAG. When shorter chain MAGs (9.7 MAG, 7.9 MAG, etc.) are used for crystallization or when serial crystallography data are collected at ambient pressure the titration in step 5.11 is still required, but it can be performed using the original LCP host lipid employed for crystallization.\nAbout 1 hr before the beginning of data collection, remove syringes with samples from the 20 °C incubator.\nSelect 2-4 syringes for sample consolidation based on a similar crystal appearance and similarity of crystallization conditions.\nCarefully remove the Parafilm sealing from the selected syringes.",
    "Remove the syringe coupler and attach a clean removable needle (gauge 26s) to the first selected syringe. Gently and slowly push the plunger forward to squeeze the precipitant out through the needle into a microcentrifuge tube. Exercise caution at this step because applying a high pressure on the plunger in this step could eject some of the crystal laden LCP along with the precipitant solution, leading to a partial or complete loss of the sample.\nStop the plunger when most of the precipitant has been removed and the LCP has accumulated at the needle entrance.\nRepeat step 5.4-5.5 with the other selected syringes.\nTo consolidate the resultant LCP samples, connect two syringes together through a clean coupler.\nDepress the plunger on one syringe to transfer the entire sample from one of the syringes to another.\nDisconnect the empty syringe.\nRepeat steps 5.7-5.9 to consolidate all of the crystal laden LCP material from the two to four pre-selected syringes into one syringe. Remove as much precipitant as possible.\nAdd ~5 µl of 7.9 MAG or the original shorter-chain MAG host lipid to an empty syringe. Connect this syringe to the syringe with the consolidated sample through a syringe coupler and mix by alternatively depressing syringe plungers. Repeat until all residual solution is absorbed and a homogeneous and transparent LCP is formed. The final amount of LCP after titration can vary from 20 to 35 µl depending on the volume of the excess precipitant and its composition.\nMove the entire mixed LCP sample into one syringe and disconnect the empty syringe.\n6. Characterization of Microcrystals\nAttach an LCP-injector loading needle (point style 3, gauge 22, one inch in length) to the syringe with consolidated sample.",
    "Carefully eject ~1 µl of the LCP sample on a glass slide and cover it with a glass cover slip. Gently press on the cover slip to sandwich the sample.\nTake images of the LCP sample under a stereo microscope at the highest possible magnification (typically 100X) using a bright-field illumination and cross-polarizers. If possible, take additional images using a UV-fluorescence microscope and a SONICC (Second Order Nonlinear Imaging of Chiral Crystals)17 imager to confirm the existence of protein microcrystals in the sample.\nEstimate crystal size and density10. The ideal crystal density for a data collection experiment will depend on the crystal size, the diameter of the X-ray beam and the diameter of the LCP stream, and should result in a crystal hit rate of about 10-40%.\n7. Adjustment of Crystal Density\nNote: If the crystal density found in Step 6.4 is too high, resulting in a large percentage of multiple crystal hits, the crystals should be diluted following the steps outlined below to optimize the sample for data collection. If the crystal density is too low for efficient data collection in all prepared samples, then the crystal growth conditions should be re-optimized, since there is no reliable method for concentrating MP crystals in LCP.\nPrepare the required amount of neat LCP to be used for dilution by mimicking the LCP composition (same lipid and precipitant) of the original sample with crystals that needs to be diluted.\nMove all neat LCP into one syringe. Detach empty syringe but leave the coupler connected.\nRemove the needle from the syringe that contains the LCP sample with microcrystals. Connect the sample syringe to the syringe containing neat LCP through the coupler.\nMix the content of the syringes by pushing it back and forth through the coupler until homogeneity is achieved.",
    "Repeat Section 6 to re-evaluate the microcrystal density in the adjusted sample.\n8. LCP Injector Loading and LCP-SFX Data Collection\nDisconnect the coupler from the syringe with the sample and attach a 1\" loading needle to the syringe.\nTransfer 20-40 µl of the sample into the reservoir of an LCP injector.\nInsert the LCP injector into the sample chamber18, start the injector, adjust the flow rate and collect LCP-SFX data.\n9. Incorporation of Soluble Protein Crystals in LCP\nNote: Using highly viscous media, such as LCP, for delivery of crystals of soluble proteins allows one to dramatically decrease protein consumption in a serial crystallography experiment. In these steps we describe how to incorporate crystals of soluble proteins in LCP. Crystals can be obtained by any technique, consolidated together in the form of a crystal suspension and filtered if necessary.\nAdjust crystal density in suspension to ensure crystal hit rates of approximately 10-40%.\nTest the compatibility of the precipitant solution with LCP using 7.9 MAG, 9.7 MAG or a 1:1 mixture of 7.9 MAG and 9.9 MAG as the host lipid.\nMix ~25 µl of the crystal suspension with ~25 µl of the host lipid using a syringe mixer until a homogeneous LCP forms.\nEvaluate crystal size and density as described in Section 6. Load the sample in the LCP injector and collect data as described in Section 8."
