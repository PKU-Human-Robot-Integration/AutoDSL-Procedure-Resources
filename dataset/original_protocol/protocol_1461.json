    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nProlonged restraint stress\nTiming: [12 or 15 h]\nPhysical restraint is among the most commonly used stressors for the evaluation of immune responses or other physiological functions in stressed animals (Glaser and Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Accordingly, mice are confined in small tubes that restrict their movement without causing pain, constriction, or suffocation (Buynitsky and Mostofsky, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). Overnight restraint during the nocturnal phase, in which mice are active, provides a model of prolonged psychological stress (Glaser and Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nTransfer mice to a procedure room separate from the original housing room. Physically confine each mouse for 12 h during the light-off period in a commercial or makeshift restrainer (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). During the confinement period, place the restraining device(s) inside a new cage(s). For 12 h of prolonged restraint stress, begin at 19:00 and end at 07:00 on the following day.\nTransfer the stressed mice back to their original home cage.\nOptional: The duration of the confinement period can be extended to 15 h, starting at 19:00 and ending at 10:00, with high circulating levels of corticosterone readily detectable during this period (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nThe non-stressed control cohort should remain undisturbed in their home cages in the original housing room with free access to food and water.\nOptional: Prolonged restraint stress results in food and water deprivation, which is a strong physiological stressor on its own. To isolate the psychological effects of restraint from the animals’ inability to access food and water, separate non-stressed cohorts can be deprived of food and water for 12 or 15 h as applicable.\nOptional: Animals can be subjected to additional interventions or receive agents or reagents of interest, such as those triggering select immune responses, before, during, and/or after the prolonged restraint period.",
    "Optional: Monitor physiological functions and/or disease outcomes, for instance by collecting blood and/or tissue specimens (e.g., primary and/or secondary lymphoid organs) at appropriate time points. Venous blood can be collected after snipping the tip of the tail using glass capillary tubes. Alternatively, blood can be drawn from the saphenous vein into a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube.\nOptional: Soluble factors and mediators of interest (cytokines, chemokines, enzymes, stress hormones, antibodies, etc.) can be quantified in the serum/plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or similar assays. For example, α-galactosylceramide (αGC), a glycolipid agonist of invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells, can be administered (100 μg/kg, i.p.) at the end of prolonged restraint stress, and blood cytokine levels can be measured at various time points post-αGC injection (Rudak et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]).\nOptional: Immune cells can be isolated from various tissues for downstream analyses (e.g., immunophenotyping, transcriptomic studies, functional assays). Fluorochrome-labeled antibodies and tetramers used for cell staining must be titrated to determine optimal working dilutions.\nUpon the completion of the confinement period, soak restraining tubes in a 1:125 solution of Virox 5 (e.g., 8 mL Virox 5 in 1 L of water) for 10 min. Subsequently, rinse the tubes in water and air-dry them for future use.",
    "Critical: It is recommended to house stressed and control mice in separate cages. Returning stressed animals to cages that contain control cage-mates will stress the latter due, in part, to odor cues (Sterley et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]). Of note, however, in our recent prolonged restraint stress experiments (Rudak et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23], 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]), in which we used cage-mates to fully control for housing conditions, we found restrained mice to exhibit a far greater stress response and significantly poorer innate-like invariant T cell responses than did control cage-mates. This suggests that the impact of social transmission of stress can be relatively mild compared to that of physical confinement. Removing one mouse from a cage that accommodates only two animals can cause stress, due to isolation, and should be avoided (Ieraci et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Senst et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib27]).\nRepeated restraint stress\nTiming: [once daily for 3 weeks]\nIn the repeated restraint stress (RRS) model, animals are exposed to the same stressor in a predictable manner, thus enabling habituation to the stressor. Repeatedly subjecting mice to restraint results in a gradual decrease in stress-induced neural activity (Matovic et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]) and glucocorticoid release (Grissom and Bhatnagar, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). This entails daily restraint at a fixed time (e.g., 11:00–12:00) for 21 days.\nPlace each mouse inside a commercial or makeshift restrainer made from a 50-mL conical tube (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) for 1 h. Place restrainers in a new cage(s).\nTransfer mice back to their home cages between restraint cycles and leave them undisturbed for the rest of the day.\nOptional: Animals can be subjected to additional interventions and/or injected with agents or reagents of interest, such as those prompting immune responses, before, during, and/or after the RRS procedure.",
    "Critical: Stress levels in animals can be affected by a multitude of confounding factors, including but not limited to environmental noise and vibration, unstable room temperatures, and poor breeding conditions. It is therefore critical to include unstressed control cohorts in each experiment. The animals’ body weight and appearance should be monitored daily. A body weight loss of up to 10% can be expected. A loss of over 15% relative to the starting weight is considered too severe, and the animal should be withdrawn from the experiment.\nCritical: Restraint should be applied at the same time of the day. This is because the effects of stress have been reported to differ between active and inactive phases (Bartlang et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Rybkin et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib25]).\nChronic variable stress\nTiming: [twice daily for 3 weeks]\nChronic variable stress (CVS) is designed to minimize habituation by applying different stressors in an unpredictable fashion (Franco et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Herman et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). Accordingly, mice are subjected to heterotypic psychological and physical stressors (including restraint), once daily and once nightly, for 21 days (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The daytime stressors, which are of brief duration, are each randomized to be introduced anytime between 08:00–18:00. The nighttime stressors can be started anytime between 17:00–19:00 and terminated anytime between 08:00–10:00 on the following day. Below, we describe several daytime and nighttime stressors, which we routinely use in our optimized protocol.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1005-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. A typical mouse model of chronic variable stress (CVS)\n(A) A weekly cycle in which various stressors are introduced is schematically illustrated and needs to be repeated thrice for a 21-day CVS study.",
    "(B) Materials and/or conditions employed to apply various stressors include cage shaking (80 rpm for 1 h), physical restraint (1 h), cold exposure (at 4°C for 1 h), forced swimming (for 15 min in a bucket containing 30°C water), cage tilting overnight (at a 30-to-45-degree angle), and wet bedding overnight. Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B is a composite of six independent images.\nDaytime stressors:\nCage shake:\nPlace cages on a horizontal rocking laboratory shaker (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) set to a speed of 80 revolutions per minute (rpm) for a one-hour duration.\nRestraint stress:\nHold mice within a restrainer prepared using a 50-mL conical tube (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) for 1 h. Place restrainers in a new cage(s).\nCold exposure:\nPlace cages inside a laboratory refrigerator maintained at 4°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) for 1 h.\nForced swim:\nFill a plastic bucket (20 cm in diameter at the top) with water to create a depth of at least 15 cm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nAdjust the water temperature to 30° ± 1°C using a thermometer. Place a mouse inside the water-filled bucket for 15 min. Dry the animal using paper towels before returning it to its home cage.\nCritical: The water temperature commonly used for forced swim is 24°C–30°C (National Research Council (US) Committee on Guidelines for the Use of Animals in Neuroscience and Behavioral Research, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). Experimenters should be aware that water temperature even within this range (e.g., 25°C vs 30°C) can have different effects on the stress response and behavior (Bächli et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Drugan et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Therefore, using a consistent water temperature is important. Switching to different temperatures requires re-evaluation of the end points.\nNighttime stressors:\nLight on:\nLeave the light on in the room where mice are housed overnight.\nCage tilt:",
    "Elevate one side of the cage until it rests at a 30–45-degree angle (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Leave the cage tilted overnight.\nCritical: Make sure the water bottle is full and mice have access to water.\nWet bedding:\nPour tap water into home cages. The amount to be used should be sufficient to soak the bedding but not too large to create a pool of free-floating water in the cage. For a standard mouse cage (26 cm × 16.5 cm × 14 cm), approximately 200 mL of room temperature water is needed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nLeave mice in their wet cage(s) overnight.\nTransfer mice to a new cage(s) with fresh bedding.\nFood deprivation:\nRemove access to food overnight by transferring mice into a new cage(s) without food. Using new cage(s) is important because mice can potentially feed on small pieces of food pellets that may fall onto the bedding of their original cage(s). Overnight food deprivation can start anytime between 17:00–19:00 and end anytime between 8:00–10:00 on the following day.\nWater deprivation:\nWithdraw access to water overnight by removing drinking bottles from home cages. Overnight water deprivation can start anytime between 17:00–19:00 and end anytime between 8:00–10:00 on the following day.\nOptional: Animals may receive additional interventions and/or agents or reagents of interest before, during, and/or after the CVS procedure.",
    "Critical: Stress levels in animals can be affected by a multitude of confounding factors, including but not limited to environmental noise and vibration, unstable room temperatures, and poor breeding conditions.

A loss of over 15% relative to the starting weight is considered too severe, which warrants the animal’s withdrawal from the experiment.\nCritical: In the case of overnight food deprivation and water deprivation, body weight needs to be measured 24 h after food/water is reintroduced to allow for recovery from a transient weight loss. Nighttime food deprivation and water deprivation should not be introduced consecutively. Moreover, their application, each, should be limited to once a week to avoid severe physiological challenges, otherwise introducing adaptive changes in addition to stress responses."
