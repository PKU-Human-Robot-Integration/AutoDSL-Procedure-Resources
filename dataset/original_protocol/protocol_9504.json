  "procedures": [
    "1. Extraction of Total RNA from Plant Seeds\nPrepare buffer sets, spin columns, 1.5 and 2.0 mL polypropylene tubes, and nuclease-free 1.5 mL polypropylene tubes.\nAdd 1% (w/v) molecular biology grade polyvinylpyrrolidone (hereafter referred to as PVP) to cell lysis buffer for RNA extraction and vortex vigorously. Incubate for 20 min at 25 °C to dissolve completely. After 20 min incubation, mix the buffer gently by turning the tube upside down to prevent the formation of bubbles. Store at room temperature (15-25 °C) before use.\nHarvest fruits from Arabidopsis thaliana plants and place in 1.5 mL polypropylene tubes on ice. Place fruits on aluminum plates kept at 4 °C and isolate seeds from the fruits under a stereo microscope.\n\t\nPlace the isolated seeds (approximately 200 seeds) into 1.5 mL polypropylene tubes that have been stored in an aluminum rack on ice and immediately place the tubes in liquid nitrogen.\nRemove the tubes from the liquid nitrogen and return them to the aluminum rack on ice. Add 100 µL of the buffer containing 1% PVP and centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C.\nHomogenize the sample with a stainless steel pestle using a motor-grinder for 60 s while keeping the tube in the aluminum rack on ice.\nAdd 550 µL of the buffer containing 1% PVP, mix the buffer gently by turning the tube upside down, and incubate for 10 min at 25 °C.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 8,000 x g at 25 °C and transfer 550 µL of the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL polypropylene tube.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 10,000 x g at 25 °C and transfer 450 µL of the supernatant to a new 1.5 mL polypropylene tube.",
    "Use the supernatant as the cell lysate for RNA extraction. Hereafter, follow the procedure described in the manufacturer's instructions in the commercially available kit.\nElute the RNA using a minimum volume of the elution buffer to ensure a sufficiently high concentration of RNA for monitoring the expression patterns of low level transcripts. Store the RNA in a deep freezer until used.\n2. Verification of RNA Quality\nThaw the total RNA, mix by gentle tapping, and place the tube in an aluminum rack on ice.\nMeasure the RNA concentration, A260/A280 ratio, and A260/A230 ratio using a microvolume spectrophotometer.\nDilute the total RNA in RNase-free water to a final concentration of 70 ng/µL.\n3. Reverse Transcription of Total RNA from Seeds\nThaw the total RNA and buffer sets from the commercial kit. Keep the enzymes from the kit on ice after gentle tapping. Prepare nuclease-free 0.2 mL polypropylene tubes.\nAdd 5 µL of total RNA, 1 µL of Oligo dT primer (50 µM), and 1 µM of Random 6-mer (50 µM) to the 0.2 mL polypropylene tube on ice.\nIncubate for 15 min at 37 ºC and place on ice.\nHereafter, follow the procedure described in the manufacturer's instructions in the reverse transcription-PCR kit.\nPlace the reverse transcription products on ice before use.\n4. Quantitative Real-time PCR Analysis\nConstruct plasmids harboring the target gene sequences using the manufacturer's protocol.\nAdjust the concentrations to 100-500,000 copies/µL for DNA templates for the standard curves.\nDilute the cDNA solutions (1:100) with distilled water.\nAdd 2 µL of the diluted cDNA solutions and the plasmids for the standard curves to the master mix from the quantitative real-time PCR kit.",
    "Set up real-time PCR using the following cycling conditions: 95 °C for 30 s and then 40 cycles at 95 °C for 5 s and 60 °C for 35 s.\nAnalyze the copy numbers according to the manufacturer's instructions for the real-time PCR system.\nSubscription Required.
