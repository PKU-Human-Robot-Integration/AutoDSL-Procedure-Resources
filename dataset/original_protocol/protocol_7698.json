    "Sort 4,000 cells directly in 75 μl of RLT buffer (Qiagen RNeasy Micro Kit) using BD FACSAria cell sorter.Isolate total RNA from sorted cells using the RNeasy Micro Kit according to manufacturer’s protocol without the addition of β-mercaptoethanol to RLT buffer. Perform on column DNA digestion for 15 min according the manufacturer’s instructions using the DNase that is provided with the RNeasy Micro Kit and elute in 14 μl of RNase/DNase free water. Yield of total RNA using a NanoDrop 1000 ranges between 30-80 ng. Amplify RNA and generate cDNA with complementary sequences to the original mRNA using the WT-Ovation Pico RNA Amplification System according to manufacturer’s instruction. Expected yield of amplified cDNA measured on a NanoDrop 1000 is between 5-10 μg. A quality control step can be included at this point by performing Real-Time PCR for known transcripts that are expected to be present in the amplified cDNA pool. Generate sense-strand cDNA targets from 3 μg of complementary sequence cDNA using the WT-Ovation Exon Module kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. Sonicate 3 μg of sense-strand cDNA that is diluted to a final volume of 400 μl Tris-EDTA pH 8.0 buffer to generate cDNA fragments in the 200-500 bp range. Sonication with Sonic Dismembrator 550 and a 419 Microtip is performed on ice with six pulses of 20 sec each (magnitude setting of 3) and a 60 sec rest interval. Quantify sense-strand sonicated cDNA on a fluorometer using the Qubit HS dsRNA assay kit according to manufacturers’ instructions and aliquot 30 ng for generating the Sequencing library.Perform End Repair (Reagents are part of the TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation Kit)table:\n﻿0,1\nSense-strand cDNA (30 ng),30 μl\nWater,10 μl\nT4 DNA Ligase Buffer with 10 mM ATP,5 μl\n10 mM dNTP mix,2 μl\nT4 DNA Polymerase (3 U μl-1),1 μl",

The majority of the amplified cDNA should appear between the 150-300 bp range. Primer dimers and adapters appear at the 30-60 bp range. Purify library by gel extracting the DNA that appears in the 150-300 bp range using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit according to manufacturer’s instructions and eluting with 15 μl RNase/DNase free water (Figure 2). Quantify library final yield on a fluorometer using the Qubit HS dsDNA assay according to manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries generated using this protocol yielded between 200-700 ng.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20130615/20130615074659_1147.jpg Figure 2. Example of gel extracted band alongside 100 bp ladder. Adapters visible around 30-60 bp. A quality control step can be included at this point by performing Real-Time PCR for known transcripts that are expected to be present in the generated library. If a quality control step was performed at step 3, before generating the library, the results should be similar.Run the cDNA library on an Illunina HiSeq 2000.
