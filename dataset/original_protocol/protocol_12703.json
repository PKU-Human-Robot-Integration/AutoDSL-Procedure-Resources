    "1. Human islet dissociation\nObtain human islets isolated from cadaver organ donors of either sex, ages between 15-80 years, without pre-existing diseases unless islets from donors with specific demographics are required for the study purpose.\n\t\nAfter isolation, have the isolated islets kept in the tissue culture facility for 2-3 days at the supplier. It often takes more than 1 day for islet damages to become visible.\nPlace the islets in a bottle and immerse it completely in the islet medium. Get it to the laboratory by overnight shipment.\nObtain the islet equivalent quantity (IEQ) of the shipped islets from the islet supplier.\nRecover islets from the shipment on the day of islet arrival. Perform this step using a hood to minimize the chance of contamination.\n\t\nCool the complete islet media (CMRL-1066, 10% (v/v) FBS, 1x Pen-Strep, 2 mM glutamine) in a refrigerator.\nTransfer the islets from the bottle to a 50 mL conical tube.\nAdd 10 mL pre-cooled complete islet media to the emptied bottle to wash out the remaining islets. Transfer the media to the conical tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 200 x g for 2 min to recover islets. Aspirate the supernatant leaving about 1-2 mL media with the pellet.\nResuspend the islets with pre-cooled complete islet media. Based on the IEQ provided by the supplier, add 12 mL media per 5000 IEQ.\nPour the islets in the media on a 10 cm non-treated tissue culture dish. Incubate overnight in a tissue culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in atmospheric air.\nDissociate islets as shown below. Perform this step following overnight incubation.\n\t\nPre-warm complete islet media and cell dissociation solution.\nPrepare 1x PBS containing 0.04% BSA at room temperature.",
    "Count and hand-pick 200-300 islets using a P200 pipette and transfer the islets to a 15 mL conical tube containing 5 mL pre-warmed complete islet media.\nCollect the islets by centrifugation at 200 x g for 2 min. Gently aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the pellet on the bottom.\nAdd 1.0 mL pre-warmed cell dissociation solution and disrupt the pellet by pipetting gently up and down. Incubate the islets at 37 °C for 9-11 min. Every 3 min pipette up and down slowly for 10 s to dissociate the cells into single cells.\nOnce islet cells are well dissociated and the solution becomes cloudy, add 9 mL complete islet media and filter through a 30 µm cell strainer into a new 15 mL conical tube.\nWash the tube and cell strainer with 2 mL complete islet media to collect the remaining islets and add to the same tube.\nCollect cells by centrifugation at 400 x g for 5 min.\nGently aspirate media and resuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL 1x PBS containing 0.04% BSA (PBS-BSA).\nFilter through a new 30 µm cell strainer into a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min to collect cells.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 200-300 µL 1x PBS-BSA solution.\nMeasure the cell concentration and adjust volume to a final concentration of 400-500 cells/µL.\n2. Single cell suspension quality control\nDetermine the cell concentration using a fluorescence-based automated cell counter34.\n\t\nMix 10 μL cells with 0.5 μL AO/DAPI. Pipette mix thoroughly. Load 10.5 μL onto the slide and run the cell count assay to determine count and viability.\nDilute and/or filter the cell suspension as necessary based on the cell count.",
    "3. Single cell partitioning using a microfluidic chip. Follow protocol from microfluidic chip manufacturer35.\nBring 3' gel beads and reverse transcription (RT) reagents to room temperature (>30 min). Reconstitute the RT primer in TE buffer if needed.\nPrepare RT master mix in a low bind tube as outlined in Table 1.\nDetermine the number of cells to be input for each sample. Calculate the cell suspension volume (X) necessary to deliver the desired target cell number. The calculated volume of nuclease-free water to add to each sample will be 33.8-X μL.\nFor each sample to be partitioned, add 33.8-X μL nuclease-free water into 0.2 mL PCR strip tube. Then, add 66.2 μL master mix to each strip tube. Do not add the cells to the strip tube at this point. Pipette gently to mix. Place the prepared strip tubes on ice.\nPlace a microfluidic chip into a chip case. Orient the chip case ensuring oil wells (row labeled 3) are closest to the person performing the experiment.\nIf running less than 8 samples, use 50% glycerol to fill unused channels in the following order:\n\t\nAdd 90 µL of 50% glycerol into the wells in row 1 for all unused channels.\nAdd 40 µL of 50% glycerol into the wells in row 2 for all unused channels.\nAdd 270 µL of 50% glycerol into the wells in row 3 for all unused channels.\nSnap the gel beads into a vortex. Vortex at full speed for 30 s. Tap the strip on the bench top several times to collect beads. Confirm that there are no bubbles present.\nAdd X μL of cells into the prepared strip tubes. Pipette to mix 5 times. Without discarding the pipette tips, transfer 90 μL of cell mixture to row 1 of the chip.",
    "Wait for 30 s, then load 40 μL of gel beads to row 2. Pipette very slowly for this step. Dispense 270 μL of partitioning oil to the wells of row 3.\nHook the chip gasket onto the tabs of the chip holder. Place the assembled chip holder into the single cell partitioning device and press the run button.\nImmediately remove the assembled chip holder upon run completion.\nRemove the chip gasket from the holder, open the chip case at a 45° angle, and remove 100 μL of the emulsion from the chip into a blue plastic 96-well plate.\n4. Single cell cDNA amplification. Follow protocol from microfluidic chip manufacturer35.\nReverse transcription.\n\tNOTE: Perform this step under a clean PCR-only hood to prevent microbial and other contamination of the unamplified cDNA.\n\t\nSeal the 96-well blue plate with a foil seal on a heated plate sealer.\nRun the reverse transcription reaction in a thermal cycler as follows: 53 °C for 45 min à 85 °C for 5 min à 4 °C hold.\n\t\tNOTE: This is a safe stopping point. Samples can hold at 4 °C for up to 72 h.\nPost-RT purification\n\t\nBring the nucleic acid binding magnetic beads and nucleic acid size selection magnetic beads to room temperature and vortex to re-suspend. At this point, thaw the sample cleanup buffer for 10 min at 65 °C. Bring all other reagents to room temperature and vortex.\nPrepare the buffers as shown in Tables 2 and Tables 3.\nChemically break the emulsion and purify.\n\t\nTo do so, gently remove the foil seal from the plate.",
    "Dispense 125 μL of pink emulsion-breaking reagent into each emulsion. Wait for 1 min, then transfer the entire volume to a clean 0.2 mL strip tube. Ensure that there is a layer of clear and a layer of pink in the strip tube.\nRemove 125 μL of the pink layer from the bottom of the strip tube without disturbing the clear layer. It is normal for a small volume (~15 μL) of the pink layer to remain in the tube.\nAdd 200 μL of cleanup mix from Table 2 to the strip tube and incubate at room temperature for 10 min.\nTransfer the strip tube to a magnetic stand and allow the solution to clear. Remove the supernatant and discard, then wash the beads with 80% ethanol twice. Allow the beads to dry for 1 min.\nRemove the strip tube from the magnet and add 35.5 μL of elution solution from Table 3 to the beads. Pipette to resuspend the beads in the solution. Incubate for 2 min at room temperature.\nTransfer the strip tube to a magnetic stand and allow the solution to clear. Remove the purified cDNA from the strip tube and dispense it to clean 0.2 mL strip tubes.\nAmplify the cDNA.\n\t\nPrepare amplification master mix in Table 4, below.\nAdd 65 μL of cDNA Amplification Master Mix to each sample. Place the strip tube in a thermal cycler and run the following program: 98 °C 3 min à 15 cycles of [98 °C 15 s à 67 °C 20 s à 72 °C 1 min] à 72 °C 5 min à 4 °C hold\n\t\tNOTE: This is a safe stopping point.
