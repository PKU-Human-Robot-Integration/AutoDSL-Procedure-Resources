    "This experimental protocol illustrates a typical taVNS set-up for use in a laboratory or clinical setting in which we target stimulating the anterior wall of the auditory canal (tragus) in a supine posture with an 8mm diameter round metal electrode. These methods can be mimicked for alternative active treatment sites by simply changing electrode position to the cymba concha. All methods and procedures have been IRB approved by the Human Research Protection Program (HRPP) at City College New York.\n1. Materials\nEnsure all materials required to administer taVNS are prepared (Figure 3). The taVNS stimulator may be either a battery driven device that meets local safety regulations or powered from a conventional electrical outlet with built-in safety mechanisms that prevent unintended electrical surges. A constant current (current controlled) stimulator with a maximum output of 5 mA is required.\nFor taVNS, use stimulation electrodes made of a round conductive metal (tin, Ag/AgCl, gold) combined with a conductive medium such as electrolyte gel or conductive paste (see table of materials). Alternatively, use conductive electrodes made with flexible conductive carbon electrodes and conductive gel that may or may not be adhesive. Never place electrodes directly on the skin without a conductive medium, as this may pose unnecessary risk to the participant and can cause discomfort or pain.\nUse computer running script software (see Table of Materials) that is programmed and used to control the stimulator and initiate stimulation with specific parameters. These parameters include current intensity (mA), pulse width (μs), frequency (Hz), duty cycle (On/Off time, s), session duration (min).\nUse alcohol preparation pads (70% isopropyl alcohol) to prepare the skin surface before attaching electrodes to the ear. This removes surface oils from the skin surface and reduces the resistance of the skin, ensuring stimulation is delivered at safe power levels.",
    "2. Ear Targeting and Skin Preparation\nUse the following general inclusion criteria for conducting taVNS in the research setting: Age 18–70, no facial or ear pain, no recent ear trauma, no metal implants including pacemakers, not pregnant.\nIn the experiments involving healthy participants in a laboratory setting, use the following exclusion criteria: personal or family history of seizure, mood, or cardiovascular disorders, dependence on alcohol or recent illicit drug use, on any pharmacological agents known to increase seizure risk.\nSeat the participant on a comfortable bed or chair in a supine or other relaxed position with legs elevated and head supported.\nInspect the left ear of the participant. Ensure no jewelry is attached and all make-up and lotion are removed. Confirm there are no skin-related contraindications at the site of stimulation, including sun burn, cuts, lesions, open sores.\nFind the stimulation target, landmarked by the anterior wall of the outer ear canal externally by finding the tragus. Stimulation will be delivered to the portion of the ear canal directly behind the tragus (Figure 4).\nUse an alcohol prep pad to gently scrub the target site, both internally and externally, to decrease skin resistance and increase conductance.\n3. Electrode Preparation and Placement\nIf using non-disposable electrodes, visually inspect electrodes to ensure clean, corrosion-free surface is exposed. Ensure that electrodes are disinfected to prevent spread of bacteria between subjects. This can be done using alcohol or sterilization wipes to scrub the electrodes. If using disposable electrodes, skip to step 3.2.",
    "Spread a thin layer of conductive paste to the surface of the electrode evenly. This will distribute electricity to the stimulation site. For an 8 mm diameter round electrode, a pea-sized amount of paste is sufficient. Spread the paste using a narrow wooden applicator to form a thin layer <1 mm of paste on both electrodes.\nConnect electrode cables to the stimulation device while the device is turned off and verify the polarity of the electrodes (red/positive electrode: anode, black/negative electrode: cathode). This is an important detail as targeting is polarity specific — the anode (red/positive terminal) is the electrode placed inside the ear canal and targeting the anterior wall of the outer ear canal. The cathode (black/negative terminal) sits on the outside of the ear attached to the tragus. For sham stimulation, the anode is placed on the anterior side of the ear.\nClip the spring electrode onto the tragus with the anode making contact with the anterior wall of the outer ear canal and the cathode contacting the anterior part of the tragus.\nNOTE: If conducting sham stimulation, clip the electrode onto the earlobe (active control). Alternatively, sham stimulation may be delivered by attaching stimulation clips to active site and delivering no electrical current (passive control).\nAs subjects will feel the pressure of the electrodes clipped to their ear, ensure this pressure is not uncomfortable or disruptive to regional blood flow as demonstrated by pale white skin at clip site or physical pain sensed by the subject. After this point, determine perceptual threshold (PT) which will be described in the next procedural step.\n4. Determination of Perceptual Threshold (PT)",
    "NOTE: Perceptual threshold is a critical value used to determine the power of taVNS stimulation. This value is defined as the minimum amount of electricity required to perceive electrical stimulation on the skin described as a pricking or tingling sensation.\nDetermine the PT using a simple step-up and step-down binary parametric search. First turn on the stimulator and set the output to 3 mA. Deliver a 1 second train of taVNS stimulation at desired pulse width (typically 250–500 μs) and frequency (25 Hz, can vary based on application).\nAsk the subject whether they felt the stimulation. Sensation is generally reported as a \"tickle\" or \"pricking\" sensation.\nIf YES, turn down stimulation intensity by 50% and repeat step 4.2. If NO, increase stimulation intensity by 50% and repeat step 4.2.\nRepeat the process described in step 4.2 until recording a minimum of 4 \"YES\" responses in which the 4th YES response must come after a NO. The intensity (in mA) of the PT will the value at which the subject says their fourth YES response to.\nUse the example PT threshold finding is listed in Table 1 to assist in PT determination.\n5. Delivering Stimulation\nOnce the subject is comfortable stimulation electrodes with properly attached to the desired target, and the perceptual threshold determined at the desired pulse width and frequency, begin the stimulation.",
    "Use a computer running a pulse generating GUI (e.g., stimDesigner, freeware included with this manuscript) connected to a data acquisition unit (DAQ) to drive the stimulation system. The software should output TTL pulses as programmable settings (Figure 5). The TTL pulses will be sent via a BNC cable to the stimulator \"trigger in\" port. This interface software/stimulator interface allows modulation of frequency, duty cycle (on/off time), and session duration (Figure 6). The GUI used is attached as a free, open-source resource with this manuscript.\nEnsure that stimulation is delivered at super-threshold levels, such as 200% of PT8,9. For example, if the PT was determined to be 0.8 mA, stimulation will be delivered at 1.6 mA.\nEnsure that the guidelines for duty cycles are followed when conducting long stimulation sessions. Typical duty cycles have 30–60 s \"on\" periods and 60–120 s \"off\" periods, or 20–50% duty cycles.\nVary the length of stimulation session (total time). Studies suggest that 30-60 min stimulation sessions at a 25% duty cycle is safe and free of any acute side effects or adverse events. These sessions can be repeated with 12–24 h between sessions safely.\nNOTE: taVNS safety is unclear for longer periods of stimulation sessions, larger percentage duty cycles (>40%), accelerated paradigms, and higher stimulation current doses.\n6. After taVNS\nWhen stimulation is completed, record objective data regarding the stimulation discomfort and side effects. Although taVNS, like implantable VNS, has limited safety concerns8,28, monitor and record sensation, discomfort, and any adverse events on a rating from 0–1029.\nRemove the stimulation electrode from the ear and clean residual conductive paste from the subject's ear using an alcohol prep pad.\nUse alcohol to clean and disinfect the stimulation electrode immediately upon removing from the subject's ear.",
