    "NOTE: All procedures described in this paper are performed according to guidelines established by the Stanford Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care (APLAC).\n1. Timed Pregnancies – Superovulation Technique (Figure 1)\nNOTE: Precisely timing the gestational age of mouse embryos for fetal surgery at E16.5 and E18.5 is of critical importance. In this section we detail our protocol for timing mouse pregnancies using pregnant mares serum (PMS) and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) injections to induce superovulation.\nInject female mice (<5 per cage) intraperitoneally (IP) with 3.0-5.0 international units (IU) of PMS in a volume of 100 μl PBS between 1:00 and 3:00 PM for day 1.\nBetween 12:00 and 2:00 PM of day 3 (forty-five to 47 hr after PMS injection), inject female mice IP with 3.0-5.0 IU of HCG in a volume of 100 μl PBS.\n\tNOTE: The HCG injection induces ovulation approximately 12 hr post-injection.\nImmediately following HCG injections, mate females with males aged 8-16 weeks.\n\tNOTE: We typically place two females into a cage of individual males.\nSeparate females from males on the morning of day 4 (6:00 – 10:00 AM) and record as fetal age E0.5.\n\tNOTE: Vaginal plugs can be checked at this time; however, the observation of a vaginal plug does not guarantee pregnancy and females can become pregnant when no plug is observed. Given that pregnancy is typically observable by visual inspection and/or palpation at gestational ages E16.5 and E18.5, checking for vaginal plugs on the morning of day 4 is not strictly necessary. In our experience, and depending on the strain, approximately 30-50% of super-ovulated females become pregnant using the technique described here.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52297/52297fig1highres.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "2. Murine Fetal Surgery (Dorsal Wounding) on E16.5 and E18.5 Embryos (Figure 2)\nBefore the procedure, clean all surfaces of the operating room and equipment with 70% isopropyl alcohol. In addition, sterilize all surgical supplies and instruments that will be used in the procedure by autoclaving them. Some institutions may allow subsequent use of hot bead sterilization. Per operation, use sterile packs that include gauze and surgical instruments.\nInduce anesthesia in pregnant mothers (fetal age E16.5 or E18.5) under 2.5% isoflurane/oxygen mixture at 2 L per min followed by maintenance anesthesia at 1 L per min.\nTo confirm proper anesthetization, ensure the deep pedal reflexes of the mouse are suppressed and place the mouse in the prone position.\nApply a vet ophthalmic ointment such as Puralube to prevent eye irritation or dryness during the procedure.\nPrepare abdomen by administering a light application of depilatory cream for no longer than 30 sec (Figure 2A).\nPrepare abdomen for aseptic surgery with povidone-iodine and alcohol (Figure 2B and 2C).\nPerform midline laparotomy under microscope using microsurgical scissors (Figure 2D and 2E).\nGently expose uterus and fetus selected for surgery (Figure 2F).\nIrrigate surgical field with warm (38 °C) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) using a blunt-tip needle\n\tNOTE: One can be made by carefully bending the tip of a large-bore needle. (Figure 2G and 2H).\nPosition the fetus in a manner that allows full access to dorsum.\nPass a purse string stitch using 7-0 nylon suture through the uterus overlying the site of intended dorsal wounding (Figure 2I). Position purse string over a region of dorsum to the left or right of spinal cord, and in a region of uterine wall devoid of large blood vessels.",
    "Make a 3 mm incision through uterine wall and amniotic sac in the center of the purse string (Figure 2J).\nIrrigate incision site with warm (38 °C) PBS.\nUsing microsurgical scissors, cut a single full-thickness excisional wound, approximately 1 mm in length, in the dorsum of the fetus.\nGently blot incision site dry with cotton-tip applicator.\nInject 3 μl volume India ink subcutaneously into the wound site to mark location of wound (Figure 2K).\nIrrigate with warm (38 °C) PBS to ensure ink has been retained within wound site.\nHave surgical assistant inject warm (38 °C) PBS through blunt-tip 10 G syringe into the amniotic sac as the purse string is closed ( Figure 2L). Retract syringe as purse string closure nears completion (Figure 2M).\nGently return uterus into the abdominal cavity (Figure 2N).\nEvert skin and peritoneum.\nHave surgical assistant irrigate abdominal cavity with warm (38 °C) PBS.\nClose abdomen quickly by stapling skin and peritoneum closed (Figure 2O). The standard closure is performed in two layers; peritoneum and abdominal muscle in one layer, subcutaneous tissue and skin in the second layer. For immediate sacrifice and harvesting of the fetus, our demonstration shows closure in one layer.\nPlace the animal under observation in a warm incubator set at 37 °C for 30 min or until the animal regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nDo not return the animal to the company of other animals until it has fully recovered from the procedure.\nUpon awaking from anesthesia and during the subsequent 48 hr, administer subcutaneous injection of buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg) every 12 hr for analgesia as needed based on pain assessment. Administer carprofen (5 mg/kg) via subcutaneous injection for additional post-operative pain relief as needed.\nReturn animals to the cage and provide them with food and water ad libitum.",
    "Monitor closely for manifestations of pain.\n48 hr post-surgery, sacrifice pregnant mother with an overdose of isoflurane and harvest wounded fetus. In order to do this, adjust isoflurane concentration to 5% or higher and maintain exposure for 1 min after cessation of breathing. Confirm euthanasia with cervical dislocation. Harvest an unwounded embryo for age-matched control. Late embryos should have a separate method of euthanasia consistent with IACUC recommendations, such as decapitation, cervical dislocation, or chemical injection.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/52297/52297fig2highres.jpg\nFigure 2.
