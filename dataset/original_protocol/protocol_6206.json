    "Cell collectionE. coli strains are inoculated by picking a single colony and cultured in 2 ml of LB with appropriate antibiotics using 14 ml tubes until they reach an optical density (OD) at 600 nm of 0.4 with a digital photometer.Fifty microliters of culture is inoculated to 50 ml of LB with appropriate antibiotics in a 200 ml flask and cultured until they reach an OD at 600 nm of 0.4 with a digital photometer.Transfer 50 ml of culture to a 50 ml tube and collect cells by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, then remove the supernatant.After washing the cell pellet twice each with chilled 1 ml of PBS (pH 8.0), resuspend the cell pellet in 2 ml of Lysis buffer and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.Collect cells by centrifugation at 8,000 x g for 5 min and gently remove the supernatant.DNA shearingResuspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of TE buffer (pH 8.0) and transfer the cell lysate to a milliTUBE 1 ml AFA Fiber.Transfer the milliTUBE into a CovarisTM M220 Focused-ultrasonicatorTM Instrument and conduct the following shearing protocol [peak power (W): 75.0; duty factor (%): 5.0; cycles/burst: 200; treatment (sec): 1200; temperature (°C): 9.0 (maximum), 7.0 (setpoint), 5.0 (minimum)] to dissociate the genomic DNA into 300-400 bp fragments.Purification of sheared genomic DNADispense a 125 μl aliquot of the total 1 ml sheared DNA solution into eight 1.5 ml Note: The capacity of the NucleoSpin Gel is limited (≤ 25 μg, 50 bp-20 kb). Purification of sheared genomic DNA is performed at room temperature.Mix sheared DNA solution with 250 μl Binding Buffer NTC.Place a NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up Column into a 2 ml Collection Tube and load sample. Centrifuge for 30 s at 11,000 x g.",
    "Discard flow-through and place the column back into the collection tube.Add 700 μl Wash Buffer NT3 buffer to the NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up Column.Centrifuge for 30 s at 11,000 x g.Discard flow-through and place the column back into the collection tube.Centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g to remove Wash Buffer NT3.Place a NucleoSpin® Gel and PCR Clean-up Column into a new 1.5 ml tube.Add 20 μl Elution Buffer NE and incubate at room temperature (18-25 °C) for 1 min.Centrifuge for 1 min at 11,000 x g. Pool all eight eluted DNA solutions into a new 1.5 ml tube.Duplex-specific nuclease reactionDetermine the DNA concentration of purified genomic DNA with QubitTM dsDNA BR Assay Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.Add 10x DSN master buffer and DSN solution (final conc. 0.05 U for 1 μg of purified DNA fragments) to purified DNA fragments, and adjust the total reaction volume to 200 μl.Note: The efficiency of the dsDNA cleaving is very high. We have demonstrated that 0.05 U is enough to cleave the 2 μg of dsDNA completely (Figure 2). In addition, since quantification of ssDNA with the fluorescent dye of the Qubit ssDNA Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Invitrogen) might not be absolutely accurate, in this protocol, treated DNA samples are qualitatively assessed.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190731/20190731210333_9458.jpgFigure 2. DSN reaction efficiency. dsDNA cleaving reaction from 2 μg of DNA pool including 70-mer ssDNA was either mock-treated or treated with 0.05, 0.1, or 0.3 U of DSN and analyzed by TapeStation with the D1000 ScreenTape.Incubate the reactions at 65 °C for 20 min to specifically cleave the dsDNA on the heat block.To inactivate the DSN reaction, add 1.5 μl of 0.5 M EDTA (final concentration: 5 mM) and incubate at room temperature for 5 min.Add 604.5 μl AMPure XP (3.0x) and mix by pipetting.",
    "Note: Because the enriched ssDNA size is expected to be about 100 bp, a little bit more AMPure is used to recover the whole amount as much as possible.After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, place the reaction tube into a magnetic stand for 2 min to separate the beads from the solution.Aspirate the supernatant from the reaction tube and discard.Dispense 200 μl of 80% EtOH and incubate at room temperature for at least 30 s.Aspirate out the ethanol and discard.Repeat Steps D7-D8 again.Take out the tube from the magnetic stand and incubate at room temperature within 5 min to remove EtOH completely.Add 17 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and mix by pipetting.Incubate at room temperature for 2 min.Place the reaction tube into a magnetic stand for 1 min to separate beads from solution.Transfer purified product to a new 0.2 ml tube.Examples of purified ssDNA before and after DSN treatment are shown in Figure 3. One microliter of sample is used in this demonstration.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190731/20190731210413_0033.jpgFigure 3. Distribution of ssDNA after the ssDNA enrichment by DSN treatment. Sixty micrograms of genomic DNA was used in a volume of 300 μl for 20 min with 1.5 U of DSN, and the reaction was inactivated by 5 mM EDTA. The enriched ssDNA was observed by the TapeStation with the D1000 ScreenTape.Dephosphorylation of ssDNAAdd 3 μl of 10x FastAP buffer and 2 μl of FastAP to the purified ssDNA and adjust the total reaction volume to 30 μl.Transfer the tube to the thermal cycler and incubate at 37 °C for 10 min.Inactivate and denature the dephosphorylated ssDNA solution by incubating the reaction at 95 °C for 2 min, quickly transfer the tube onto ice for 2-3 min, and then subsequently transfer it to room temperature (products: 50 μl of [deP-ssDNA]).",

Reagents used for primer annealingimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190731/20190731220535_4545.jpgIncubate the reactions at 65 °C for 2 min and place on ice for 1 min.Transfer the tube to a precooled thermal cycler at 15 °C (leave the lid open) and add 1 μl of Gflex.Increase the temperature by 0.1 °C/s, from 15 °C to 68 °C, and maintain the reaction at 68 °C for 5 min.",
    "Wash the beads with 1x B&W buffer (product: [dsDNA-beads]).I-SceI restriction digest to release the product from the beadsAdd 1 μl of I-SceI and 5 μl of 10x CutSmart buffer to [dsDNA-beads], and bring the volume up to 50 μl.Incubate at 37 °C for 1 h, and transfer the supernatant to a new tube.Add 150 μl AMPure XP (3.0x) and mix by pipetting.Note: The fragment size is expected to be about 100 bp, a little bit more AMPure is used to recover the whole amount as much as possible.After incubation at room temperature for 5 min, place the reaction tube into a magnetic stand for 2 min to separate the beads from the solution.Aspirate the supernatant from the reaction tube and discard.Dispense 200 μl of 80% EtOH and incubate at room temperature for at least 30 s.Aspirate out the ethanol and discard.Repeat Steps J6-J7 again.Take out the tube from the magnetic stand and incubate at room temperature within 5 min to remove EtOH completely.Add 10 μl of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and mix by pipetting.Incubate at room temperature for 2 min.Place the reaction tube into a magnetic stand for 1 min to separate the beads from solution.Transfer purified product to a new 0.2 ml tube.Library preparation and sequencingThe library is prepared using the ThruPLEX DNA-seq Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions.Note: Because a low amount of adapter-ligated DNA fragment is expected, the low input library preparation kit (ThruPLEX DNA-seq Kit) is used. Of course, other kits may be used (such as Low input Library Prep Kit, Clontech Laboratories, Inc.). Using this protocol we successfully prepared the library with 14 cycle amplification.Quality check of the library is performed by the TapeStation with D1000 ScreenTape (Figure 4).",
    "Sequencing is performed on the NextSeq 500 instrument using a NextSeq 500 High Output Kit (75 bp single-end read).Note: The read length should be 70 bp or more in consideration of the adapter size. The optimal amount of sequence read is 1 million for E. coli genome. The library is pooled according to the amount of read required to analysis. In the case of NextSeq 500 High Output Kit (75 bp single-end read), you can pool approximately 1% of the total.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190731/20190731210457_5830.jpgFigure 4. Final library of ThruPLEX with 14 cycle amplification was analyzed by the TapeStation with the D1000 ScreenTape assay. The electropherogram shows a peak with a maximum at 212 bp."
