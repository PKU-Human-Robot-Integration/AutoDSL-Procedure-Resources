    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nYeast induction and slide preparation\nTiming: 24 h\nThis protocol yields yeast cells that are expressing the protein of interest. Here, yeast cells are grown for 16–20 h in raffinose media to prime the cells for induction and then transferred to galactose media to induce expression of MATR3-eGFP. After induction, cells are harvested and immobilized on an agarose pad for imaging.\nInducing yeast.\nPrepare a 5 mL culture of MATR3-eGFP yeast in liquid raffinose synthetic yeast media with histidine drop-out (SRaff-His, see Recipe). This can be inoculated from newly transformed plates of yeast or from glycerol stocks of yeast (see yeast transformation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2] step 13). Incubate this culture in a rotating drum or in a shaker at 30°C for 16–20 h.\nPreparing yeast for induction.\nMeasure the OD600nm of the SRaff-His yeast cultures.\nCalculate the volume of culture needed to prepare 5 mL of culture at OD600nm 0.5 and transfer this volume to a new tube.\nPellet the transferred cells at 3,200 × g (4,000 RPM) for 5 min and decant the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 5 mL of liquid galactose synthetic yeast media with histidine drop-out (SGal-His, see Recipe).\nIncubate the yeast cultures in a rotating drum at 30°C for 5 h.\nNote: You may need to induce for more or less time depending on the expression level of your protein of interest.\nAgarose pad slide preparation.\nPreparing agarose pads.\nAdd 40 mg of low melting point agarose and 1 mL of liquid SGal-His media to a 1.5 mL tube with safe-lock.\nHeat the solution to 100°C in a thermomixer. Vortex and flick the tube to dissolve the agarose into the media. Once melted, flick the tube to dislodge bubbles.",
    "Note: The agarose/galactose solution can be used repeatedly once dissolved. Store at 20°C–25°C after use and reheat for next use to melt the agarose. This solution can be stored up to 6 months.\nApply a single layer of lab tape to about a half-dozen microscope slides. Ensure that the tape lies completely flat, with no bubbles, and does not wrap around to the back of the slide. These slides are simply used for spacing to achieve an appropriately thick agarose pad and will not be used for imaging.\nForming agarose pads.\nTape a clean piece of parafilm down to the lab bench. Lay out alternating clean microscope slides and taped microscope slides (see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Be sure to keep the slides flat and even with each other.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1876-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Diagram of slide layout alternating plain and taped microscope slides on a piece of parafilm\nTaped slides are used to achieve equally thick agarose pads on all slides. Created with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nCarefully pipet 23 μL of melted agarose/galactose solution to the center of a microscope slide that does not have tape applied.\nAfter a brief pause (∼5 s) to allow the solution to cool slightly, lay another clean microscope slide perpendicular across the agarose drop to set the thickness of the agarose pad (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1876-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Diagram of layout of slides for formation of agarose pads of uniform thickness\nCreated with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nAllow the agarose pads and slides to set for approximately five minutes to ensure that the agarose has solidified.\nCarefully separate the paired slides by lifting off the top slide and laying it down with the agarose pad face up (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Try not to let the agarose pad fold over on itself. Use whichever slide the agarose pad sticks to.",
    "imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1876-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Process of preparing slides for imaging\n(A) Separate slides and place slide with agarose pad facing up.\n(B) Apply 5 μL of resuspended yeast (pink) directly to the center of the agarose pad.\n(C) Add a 12 mm circular coverslip (green) on top of the yeast.\n(D) Stabilize the coverslip with a pair of tweezers and apply clear nail polish (purple) around the coverslip.\n(E) After a few minutes, apply a second coat of nail polish.\nCreated with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nHarvesting and applying yeast to agarose pads.\nHarvest the yeast from the expression cultures by pelleting the cells at 3,200 × g (4000 RPM) for 5 min. Decant the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in 200 μL of galactose media and transfer the cells to a 1.5 mL tube.\nOptional: At this stage, the yeast cells could be incubated with Hoechst stain for nuclear imaging if desired.\nApply 5 μL of resuspended yeast directly to the center of the agarose pad (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nLay a 12 mm circular Type 1.5 glass coverslip on top of the yeast and agarose pad (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nStabilize the coverslip with a pair of forceps while gently applying clear nail polish around the edges of the coverslip (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D). The nail polish should contact the full perimeter of the cover slip and should also contact the microscope slide in a full perimeter beyond the agarose to be sealed.\nAllow the nail polish to dry for several minutes, then apply a second layer of nail polish to ensure the agarose pad is fully sealed (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nStore and transport the slides horizontally to the microscope for imaging. Slides are suitable for imaging up to several hours after preparation.",
    "Note: We typically prepare 2–3 slides per strain in case a slide is not properly sealed or if slides break during acquisition.\nFRAP imaging\nTiming: 3–4 h\nA Zeiss LSM880 Confocal Microscope with Airyscan was employed to acquire FRAP data for MATR3-eGFP. This section details the parameters and steps for performing FRAP experiments on MATR3-eGFP with this imaging system (see Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). Although our yeast strains are immobilized between the agarose pad and coverslip, we found that the MATR3 condensates move throughout the cell. To circumvent this limitation, we streamlined acquisition and opened the pinhole for a greater depth of view. Considerations for optimization of different protein systems are found in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1876-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Schematic detailing the steps to setup, acquire, and process a FRAP experiment\nCreated with BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nMicroscope Setup.\nTurn on the microscope system and ZEN Black software with the 488 nm and 405 nm laser lines turned on. We used an alpha Plan-Apochromat 100× / 1.40 Oil DIC M27 objective.\nJust before imaging each slide, confirm that the nail polish seal is intact by checking that a yeast film is visible beneath the coverslip. Add a drop of 30C immersion oil to the objective and place the microscope slide onto the stage.\nNote: We do not utilize a heated chamber for live yeast cell imaging.\nNote: We recommend the use of 30C immersion oil due to the prolonged imaging of each slide. This oil will prevent overheating of the sample.\nUnder the Locate tab of ZEN, use GFP epifluorescence to locate and focus on the yeast cells (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1876-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Setting up ZEN Black software and adjusting key parameters\n(A) Details of the “Locate” tab including the light path. Corresponds to step 3c.",
    "(B) Details of the “Acquisition” tab including experimental setup, light paths, and acquisition parameters. Corresponds to step 3d.\n(C) Details of the “Processing” tab including parameters for Airyscan Processing. Corresponds to step 5a.\nSwitch to the Acquisition tab of ZEN to setup the parameters for FRAP imaging as follows (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B):\nCheck the “Time Series”, “Bleaching”, and “Regions” boxes.\nNote: To acquire images with appropriately fast time frames, we do not utilize Z-stack imaging.\nUnder “Imaging Setup”, setup GFP detection from the LSM Tab.\nUnder “Acquisition Mode” set the frame size to 520 × 520 pixels, speed to 2.02 μsec, line averaging of 2, bit depth of 8 bits, bidirectional scanning, and 4× zoom (see problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).\nUnder “Channels” setup a single track for EGFP with the 488 nm laser set to 1.5% and 824 V gain. Open the pinhole to 5.38 Airy units (AU) (see problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nNote: The laser power represented in percentage is a relative number between systems. Furthermore, the absolute power compared to laser percentage can vary on the same system depending on the age of the laser source. As such, one should always optimize laser power when starting a new set of experiments. See problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1] for more information about optimizing laser power during bleaching, or problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7] for more information about optimizing laser power to minimize general photobleaching.\nNote: By partially opening the pinhole, the detectors receive more signal from a larger Z slice. Since we are unable to use multiple Z-slices in our experimental setup, this helps us collect more Z information. Additionally, a deeper field of view will help minimize the impact of Z drift of our focus-of-interest. However, opening the pinhole further could be detrimental by allowing more than one focus within the Z plane.",
    "Under “Time Series” use 100 cycles with an interval of 0 for a total of 2 min of acquisition. With these acquisition settings, our frame interval is about 1.3 s per frame.\nUnder “Bleaching” set to acquire five scans before bleaching. Bleach for 50 iterations. Use a different scan speed for bleaching at 16 μsec/pixel. Activate the 405 nm laser at 1% and the 488 nm laser at 70% for bleaching (see Note above, and see problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]). A decrease in GFP signal of at least 50% should be achieved consistently with these parameters.\nNote: On ZEN Black, all of these acquisition parameters can be saved under the experimental manager to be recalled for future imaging sessions.\nAcquiring a FRAP Experiment.\nFor a new experiment, first use Continuous mode to locate a field of view with multiple yeast cells and focus on the condensate of interest.\nCritical: To prevent pre-photobleaching of the sample, be sure to complete this process quickly and turn off Continuous mode before proceeding to the next step.\nNote: Continuous mode uses the laser power, detector gain, pixel dwell time, and scan speed settings which were set in Acquisition Parameters (see step 3d).\nNote: In selecting a focus for bleaching, try to find one which is rather stable in its position (i.e., not moving around the cell or drifting away slowly). Furthermore, a focus must >500 nm in diameter for bleaching.\nUnder “Regions” draw a horizontal rectangular region of interest (ROI) across the widest point of the condensate of interest.\nAdjust this rectangle to a width of 25 pixels and a height of 1 pixel.\nRecenter on the condensate if necessary (see problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nWithout delay, start experiment to acquire the data.",
    "Note: Upon initiation, check that the drawn ROI is still aligned with the condensate of interest, which may have shifted during setup. If the ROI is no longer aligned, or if the condensate disappears from view during acquisition, the experiment should be aborted as it will not be a useful trial.\nData Processing and Analysis.\nNote: This section details how to determine if an experiment meets the criteria to be counted as a trial for qualitative reporting. It is helpful to perform this analysis during an imaging session to keep track of how many additional trials are needed per strain.\nUnder the “Processing” tab of ZEN Black, select Airyscan Processing and run 2D processing on your newly acquired image (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). For all MATR3-eGFP data, we processed images with a 6.9 Airyscan parameter.\nNote: All images in a data set need to be processed using the same Airyscan Parameter. For a new data set, run 2D Airyscan processing on a variety of images using the automatic function and note their resulting Airyscan parameter. Choose a representative or mean Airyscan parameter and reprocess all images in the data set using this parameter.\nEvaluate the deconvolved image under the “Mean ROI” tab. This tab will automatically generate a curve of GFP signal measured within the drawn ROI versus time (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Additionally, it shows the deconvolved micrographs adjacent to the generated recovery curve.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1876-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. ZEN Black software screen shots of “Mean ROI” automatically generated recovery curves and corresponding micrographs\nGenerated recovery curves plot the signal intensity within the drawn ROI against time. In the case of bleached focus drift in the X, Y, or Z directions, the generated curve does not represent recovery within the bleached region.",
    "(A and B) Data presented of an experiment which does meet the criteria of a trial (6A) and an experiment which cannot be counted as a trial (6B). White box indicates bleached region. Note that due to drift, the data shown in experiment A cannot be quantified, but does demonstrate recovery.\nScale bar, 1 μm.\nNote: Although a recovery curve is automatically generated in the “Mean ROI” display, this curve may not be an accurate depiction of recovery observed in the experiment. In our experiments, the bleached focus nearly always drifted in the X, Y, and sometimes Z direction. Since the drawn ROI does not drift with the bleached focus, the ROI does not remain aligned with the bleached region if the focus drifts. The automatically generated curve plots the signal detected within the ROI against time, which does not represent recovery within the bleached region in the case of focus drift. The main use of the generated recovery curve is to observe the percent decrease in signal from pre-bleach to post-bleach images.\nEvaluate if the experiment can be counted as a trial by ensuring that each experiment meets each of the following criteria:\nThe focus was bleached.\nThe bleached region is in the center of the focus, not on the edge.\nThe GFP signal decreased at least 50% from pre-bleach to post-bleach (evaluate with automatically generated curve).\nThe focus remains within the field-of-view over the two-minute recovery period such that recovery or lack-thereof is evident.",
    "Note: In Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A, the experiment meets all of the above criteria to be counted as a trial. Clear recovery of the focus can be observed by two minutes post-bleach, although the focus has drifted in the XY plane. Because of this movement of the focus, recovery cannot be accurately quantified and analysis should instead be done qualitatively. In Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B, the experiment does not meet the requirements to be counted as a trial. The bleached region is on the edge of focus rather than in the center, which makes recovery more difficult to observe. Additionally, the focus drifts in the Z direction in addition to some XY drift, which means the focus is not clearly within the field-of-view. As such, we cannot observe whether the focus recovered from the bleaching or not. Note that the recovery curve for Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B is very jagged due to movement of the focus, indicating that it cannot be used to accurately assess if the focus recovered or not.\nSave a copy of the table in “Mean ROI” to have the real time stamps of each frame.\nSave all images with both raw and processed files for your records.\nObtain at least ten trials per strain for qualitative publication of the results."
