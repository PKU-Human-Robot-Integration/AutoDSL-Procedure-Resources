    "All these experiments follow the animal care and ethical guidelines of the Centro Académico de Medicina de Lisboa.\n1. Fertilized quail and chicken egg incubation\nPlace fertilized eggs of Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) in a 38 °C humidified incubator for 3 days. Incubate the eggs (egg blunt end) facing up in the air chamber.\n\tNOTE: The humidified environment is achieved by placing a water container at the bottom of the incubator.\nIncubate fertilized eggs of chicken (Gallus gallus) for 2.5 days in a 38 °C humidified incubator. Incubate the eggs in a horizontal position and mark the upper side using a piece of charcoal to identify the embryo location.\n\tNOTE: Start with 40 quail eggs and 60 chicken eggs when establishing this experiment.\n2. Isolation of quail endoderm containing the prospective domain of the thymic rudiment\nNOTE: Use a horizontal laminar flow hood and sterilized instruments and materials for egg manipulation procedures in sterile conditions.\nRemove the embryonic region containing the presumptive territory of thymic rudiment, the pharyngeal arch region containing the 3rd and 4th arches (3/4PAR), as described7,8.\n\t\nFill a large borosilicate glass bowl (100 mm x 50 mm; 100 cm3) with 60 mL of cold phosphate-buffered saline solution (PBS).\nWith the help of curved scissors, tap and cut a circular hole in the shell of a quail egg that has been incubated for 3 days. Make the hole on the opposite side of the egg blunt and transfer the yolk (with the embryo) to the bowl with cold PBS.\nRemove the embryo from the yolk by cutting the vitelline membrane externally to extra-embryonic vessels using curved scissors.\nWith the help of thin forceps, transfer the embryo to a small bowl (60 mm x 30 mm; 15 cm3) filled with 10 mL of cold PBS.",
    "With a skimmer, move the embryo to a 100 mm Petri dish with a black base (see Table of Materials) containing 10 mL of cold PBS and place it under a stereomicroscope.\nDissect the 3/4PAR, as previously described8.\nAspirate the 3/4PAR and transfer to a glass dish three-quarters filled with cold PBS using a 2 mL sterile Pasteur pipette.\nIsolate the endoderm containing the presumptive territory of thymic rudiment (the 3/4PP endoderm) by enzymatic digestion with pancreatin.\n\t\nWith the help of spatula and thin forceps, transfer the 3/4PAR to a glass dish three-quarters filled with cold pancreatin (8 mg/mL; 1:3 dilution of 25 mg/mL with cold PBS).\nIncubate for 1 h on ice for enzymatic digestion.\n\t\tNOTE: The time of enzymatic digestion depends of the stage of development (Table 1).\nPlace the glass dish under the stereomicroscope (40x-60x magnification) to isolate the endoderm from the 3/4PAR.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep all surfaces and solutions cold during this procedure. Change to a new cold pancreatin solution if taking a long time to dissect the tissues (>15 min). As an illumination source, use LED lights incorporated in the stereomicroscope or in the optic fibers, considering the limited heat load.\nTo isolate the endoderm from the surrounding tissues, use two stainless steel microscalpels in pin holders.\n\t\tNOTE: Use microscalpels with a diameter between 0.1 mm and 0.2 mm and nickel pin holders with a jaw opening diameter of 0 mm to 1 mm.\n\t\t\nFirst remove the neural tube and mesoderm attached to the dorsal surface of the pharyngeal endoderm.\nWith the dorsal side up, carefully detach and remove the mesenchyme between the pharyngeal arches and expose the pharyngeal pouches. Perform this procedure on both sides of the 3/4PAR.\nRemove the heart tube and the mesenchyme surrounding the anterior pouches.",
    "With the ventral side up, cut the ectoderm of the 2nd and 3rd pharyngeal arches and carefully remove the mesenchyme attached to the pouches. Repeat this procedure on the other side of the 3/4PAR. At this stage the thyroid rudiment should be visible.\nRemove any remaining mesenchymal cells attached to the pharyngeal endoderm with the two microscalpels.\nMake a transversal cut between the 2nd and 3rd PP, dissociating the pharyngeal endoderm containing the 3rd and 4th pouches from the anterior part of the endoderm having the thyroid rudiment and 2nd pharyngeal pouch.\nWith the help of spatula and thin forceps, transfer the isolated 3/4PP endoderm to a glass dish three-quarters filled with 100% cold fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nKeep the glass dish with the isolated tissues on ice during the preparation of in vitro assay. Alternatively, the isolated tissues can be three-dimensionally preserved and in situ analyzed for gene-expression.\n3. Isolation of chicken somatopleura mesoderm\nNOTE: Perform egg manipulation procedures in sterile conditions using a horizontal laminar flow hood and sterilized instruments and materials.\nRemove the embryonic territory containing the somatopleura mesoderm at the level of somites 19-24 (ss19-24).\n\t\nRemove the chicken egg from the incubator after 2.5 days of incubation.\nWith curved scissors, open a small hole in the shell. Insert a needle and aspirate 2 mL of albumin with a 10 mL syringe to lower albumin volume inside the egg and prevent damage of the embryo (located below the marked region of the shell). Discard the aspirated albumin.\nCut a circular hole (up to two-thirds of the top surface area) in the marked region of the shell using curved scissors.\nCut the vitelline membrane externally to the extraembryonic vessels while holding the embryo with thin forceps.",
    "Under a stereomicroscope, place the embryo in a 100 mm Petri dish with a black base containing 10 mL of cold PBS.\n\t\tNOTE: Use a stereomicroscope from this point forward for progressive magnification of microsurgery procedures.\nUse four thin insect pins to hold the embryo to the bottom of the plate. Place the pins in the extraembryonic region forming a square shape.\nPerform two cuts between the somites 19 and 24 transversely to the embryo axis and crossing all embryo territory, using wecker eye scissors.\nRelease the embryo section, ss19-24, by cutting marginal embryonic edges.\nAspirate the ss19-24 tissues and transfer to a glass dish three-quarters filled with cold PBS using a 2 mL sterile Pasteur pipette.\nIsolate the lateral mesoderm from somatopleura region (ss19-24) by enzymatic digestion with pancreatin (8 mg/mL; 1:3 dilution of 25 mg/mL with cold PBS).\n\t\nWith the help of spatula and thin forceps, transfer the ss19-24 tissues to a glass dish three-quarters filled with cold pancreatin solution.\nIncubate for 30 min on ice for enzymatic digestion.\nUnder the stereomicroscope, isolate the mesoderm from the surrounding tissues using two microscalpels in a holder.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep all surfaces and solutions cold during this procedure. Change to a new cold pancreatin solution if taking a long time to dissect the tissues (>10 min.). As an illumination source, use LED lights incorporated in the stereomicroscope or in the optic fibers, considering the limited heat load.\nDuring mesoderm isolation, first remove the ectoderm at the surface followed by careful detachment of the ventrally located splancnopleura tissues.\nRelease the right lateral mesoderm of the somatopleura by cutting it in a parallel motion to the neural tube.\nRepeat the mesoderm separation of the left side of the embryo.",
    "NOTE: Make slow microscalpel movements during this procedure. The exposed extra-cellular matrix proteins stick to tissues and instruments preventing fluid movements.\nWith the help of spatula and thin forceps transfer the isolated mesoderm to a glass dish three-quarters filled with cold FBS.\nKeep the glass dish with the isolated tissues on ice during the preparation of in vitro assay.\n4. In vitro  organotypic assay: heterospecific association of quail 3/4PP endoderm and chicken somatopleura mesoderm\nPrepare the culture medium with RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep3,5.\nPlace a metal grid in a 35 mm Petri dish with 5 mL of culture medium.\n\tNOTE: Remove the excess of liquid to level the medium surface with the top of the grid.\nWith the help of thin forceps, dip a membrane filter into the culture medium and then place it on the top of the grid to have one surface in contact with air.\n\tNOTE: One-quarter of the membrane area (with 13 mm diameter) is adequate for the tissue association.\nUnder the stereomicroscope, associate the isolated tissues on the top of the membrane filter. First transfer the 3/4PP endoderm (step 2) from the glass dish by gentle sliding with the help of a transplantation spoon (or spatula) and thin forceps. Repeat this procedure for the isolated mesoderm (step 3).\n\tNOTE: With the help of a microscalpel, mix the tissues to maximize its association.\nCarefully place the associated tissues in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 48 h. Cultured tissues can be grafted onto the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) .\n\tNOTE: Ectopic organ formation in the CAM was previously detailed8.\nSubscription Required.
