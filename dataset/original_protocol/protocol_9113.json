    "1. Preparation of biotin- λ-DNA\nNOTE: Biotin-λ-DNA molecules are prepared by ligating a biotin-labeled oligonucleotide, 5'-AGGTCGCCGCCC(A)20-biotin-3' to λ-DNA molecules20.\nPrepare 0.1 mM biotin labeled oligo in TE buffer.\nHeat 0.5 mg/mL λ-DNA stock at 65 °C for 60 s, and plunge into wet ice right away.\n\tNOTE: Fast quench cooling reduces λ-DNA concatemerization.\nPipette 100 µL of the λ-DNA solution into a microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd 1 µL of the 0.1 mM oligo into 9 µL of TE buffer.\nAdd 2 µL of the oligo solution to the microcentrifuge tube containing the λ-DNA. Mix thoroughly.\n\tNOTE: Oligo is present in approximately a 12-fold molar excess over the complementary λ-DNA end.\nHeat the λ-DNA/oligo mixture at 65 °C for 60 s.\nSlowly cool the mixture to room temperature.\n\tNOTE: This step allows the oligo to anneal to the complementary λ-DNA end.\nPlace the mixture on ice. Add 11 µL of T4 DNA ligase reaction buffer (final buffer concentration 1x). Mix gently. Then add 2 µL (800 units) of T4 DNA ligase enzyme. Mix gently.\nIncubate the mixture for 2 h at 16 °C or overnight at 4 °C.\nPurify the product using centrifugal filter tubes with a nominal molecular weight limit of 100 kDa. Specifically, transfer the step 1.9 mixture into a centrifugal filter tube and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 5 min, wash with 400 µL TE buffer twice, and collect the purified product.\n\tNOTE: The as-purified biotin-λ-DNAs in TE buffer are stable at -20 °C for up to one year.\n2. Coverslip functionalization",
    "NOTE: Glass coverslips are functionalized by reacting with silane-PEG-biotin. This one-step reaction protocol is simpler and more reliable in our experience than the standard two-step reaction protocol20. Coverslip functionalization with silane-PEG-biotin creates binding sites for streptavidin and minimizes nonspecific DNA and protein adsorption to the coverslip surface.\nSonicate five no. 1 coverslips in 95% ethanol inside a staining jar for 10 min and then rinse with ultrapure water for three times.\n\tNOTE: The fifth coverslip provides a spare in case of breakage.\nFill the staining jar with 1 M KOH, sonicate for 10 min and then rinse with ultrapure water three times.\nRepeat the 2.1-2.2 cycle twice.\nDry the coverslips under clean dry N2 gas flow.\nFurther clean and dry the coverslips by applying air plasma treatment at 900 mTorr pressure for 5 min.\nIncubate coverslips with 25 mg/mL silane-peg-biotin dissolved in 95% ethanol at room temperature for 2 h. Specifically, sandwich 50 µL silane-peg-biotin solution between two clean dry coverslips, and incubate the coverslip \"sandwiches\" inside a closed pipette tip box with about 10 mL of water at the bottom (not in contact with the coverslips) to minimize solvent evaporation.\nWash away excess PEG molecules with ultrapure water and dry the PEG coated coverslips under clean dry N2 gas flow.\n\tNOTE: The functionalized coverslips can be stored up to three days under ambient conditions.\n3. Flow cell construction\nNOTE: Flow cells are constructed by sandwiching a double-adhesive tape with pre-cut channels between a PEG functionalized coverslip and a PDMS slab containing inlet and outlet holes. Multiple channels are integrated per flow cell.",
    "Design flow channels in a CAD software and cut the channels (the width, depth and length of each channels are 1, 0.13 and 12 mm, respectively) on a double-adhesive tape by using a tape cutter (typically eight channels are integrated per flow cell). Remove tape residuals to form the flow channels.\nTo make PDMS slabs, thoroughly mix 45 g of PDMS with 5 g of crosslinking reagent (enough for making twelve 5-mm thick PMDS slabs which can be stored indefinitely under ambient conditions) using a mixer, pour the mixture into two 10 cm Petri dishes, and leave the dishes inside a vacuum chamber until essentially all air bubbles are gone (manually remove air bubbles if any remain when the dishes are removed from the vacuum chamber). Then transfer the dishes into an 80 °C oven until PDMS solidifies (about 2 h).\nCut out a PDMS slab that matches the size of the double-adhesive tape with pre-cut channels. Peel one protection film off the double-adhesive tape and adhere the film to a flat face of the PDMS slab. Punch the outlet and inlet holes on the PDMS slab using a biopsy hole-puncher with a 23 Gauge needle.\nPeel the second protection film off the double-adhesive tape and adhere the PDMS-tape assembly to the functionalized surface of the coverslip (make sure that the coverslip is flat. See a picture of a fully assembled flow cell in Figure 1a).\n4. TIRF Imaging\nNOTE: Biotin-λ-DNAs are tethered to a flow channel surface and laminar flow is applied to flow stretch the DNA molecules (Figure 1b). The > 80% stretched DNA molecules serve as spatially extended templates for observing the binding and transport activity of fluorescently labeled molecules. The trajectories of single molecules are tracked by time-lapse TIRF imaging (Figure 1c & e).",
    "Fix the flow cell on a microscope stage and load pre-degassed blank buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, 2 mM NaCl, 50 µM EDTA, 20 mM ethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.01% Tween-20, 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4), 0.2 mg/mL streptavidin solution, 1 mg/mL Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) solution and 100 pM biotin-λ-DNA solution into four reservoirs that each have a Tygon tubing connected to a solenoid value and another Tygon tubing connected to a PEEK tubing by sleeving the Tygon tubing over the smaller PEEK tubing (prevents backflow of reagents). Degas small volumes of buffer by overnight exposure to vacuum or shorter exposure to vacuum with stirring (until bubbles are no longer visible).\nInsert the PEEK tubing of the blank buffer reservoir into one inlet hole of the flow cell. Prime the channel by flowing in blank buffer, and insert three other PEEK tubing into inlet holes The air pressure driven flow of each reagent is controlled by solenoid valves and fully automated via a computer script. Be careful not to induce air bubble formation in the channel.\nConnect a Tygon tubing with a short PEEK tubing from the outlet hole to a waste container. The short PEEK tubing at the outlet helps suppress air bubble formation during infusion by maintaining positive pressure inside the channel.\nTethering biotin- λ-DNA molecules to a flow channel surface.\nFlow in 0.2 mg/mL streptavidin solution, incubate for 5 min and then flow in blank buffer to wash out the unbound streptavidin.\nFlow in 1 mg/mL BSA solution, incubate for 1 min, and then flow in blank buffer to wash out the unbound BSA.\n\t\tNOTE: BSA further suppresses DNA and sample adsorption to the surface.",
    "Flow in 100 pM biotin-λ-DNA solution, incubate for 10 min and then flow in blank buffer to wash out the unbound DNAs.\n\t\tNOTE: After the DNA is bound to the surface, avoid rapid flows to prevent damage to the tethered DNA molecules.\nTo check the quality of the functionalized coverslip, flow in DNA staining dye such as Sytox orange under the assay conditions to be used (read 4.6 below), and start fluorescence imaging under 532 nm laser illumination.\n\tNOTE: The quality of the functionalized coverslip is typically good and the density of flow stretched DNA molecules will be high. It is essential to have a high enough density of flow stretched DNA molecules so that DNA binding and sliding/1D diffusion events can be observed.\nFine tune the TIRF angle to achieve best signal to noise ratio of images of stretched DNA molecules (Figure 1d).\nTo record trajectories of single molecules moving along DNA, repeat steps 4.2-4.4 inside a new channel (without DNA staining dye), then infuse pre-degassed sub-nanomolar fluorophore labeled molecules at a high enough flow rate by using a syringe pump and collect time-lapse fluorescence images with a frame rate of 100 Hz.\n\tNOTE: A flow rate equivalent to a Weissenberg number (Wi: the dimensionless product of the longest polymer relaxation time - approximately 0.2 s for λ-DNA - and the shear rate - the change in flow velocity with distance from the coverslip surface) of 500 inside the channel is recommended for single molecule imaging with a frame rate of 100 Hz21.\n\t\nCollect 10,000 frames in one Field-Of-View (FOV) to produce a movie, and collect similar movies from multiple (typically ten) FOVs per sample.",
    "NOTE: The density of single particles in one FOV should be neither too high - which will complicate data analysis by making object assignment across frames ambiguous, nor too low - which might lead to low occurrence of single molecule events on DNA.\nOptimize the illumination intensity so that molecules bound to the coverslip surface are quickly photo-bleached to suppress background while molecules diffusing on DNA are not bleached too quickly so that longer trajectories can be detected.\n\t\tNOTE: We typically use 200 - 800 W/cm2 power density in the FOV.\nAt the end of step 4.6, infuse DNA staining dye to confirm that DNA molecules can still be flow-stretched.\nRun both positive and negative control samples.\n\tNOTE: A good positive control is a tetrapeptide, TetraMethylRhodamine(TMR)-KRRR (TMR is coupled to the N-terminal amine) which has a mean 1D diffusion constant of 10.5 ± 0.7 (standard error) M(bp2/s) at neutral pH11. A good negative control is to measure labeled samples of interest in assay buffer in a channel that has no DNA tethered, where no on-DNA diffusion activity should be detected.\n5. Data Analysis:\nNOTE: A custom single particle tracking software is used to identify trajectories of single molecules diffusing along DNA and estimate diffusion constants. This software first determines the centroid positions of single particles with high accuracy, identifies particles that are stuck on the coverslip surface, and then links particles in different frames to form time-lapse trajectories. From these trajectories, the 1D diffusion constants are estimated.\nTo start data analysis, open a scripting software (see table of materials) and go to the directory of the single particle tracking software. Open the script named \"largedataprocess3.m\". One important parameter to be defined is the threshold value for single particle detection.",
    "To determine the optimal threshold value, run the \"Determine_threshold_value.m\" script. This script will indicate how the threshold value affects single particle detection.After determining the optimal threshold value, run the \"largedataprocess3.m\" script.\nAfter completion of single particle tracking analysis, filter the raw trajectories by running the \"Trajectory_filtering.m\" script. A Graphic User Interface (GUI) is built in to visualize the filtering step.\nOn the GUI panel, set the minimal displacement along DNA, MinXDisp, to 2 pixels; set the maximal displacement transverse to DNA, MaxYDisp, to 2 pixels; set the minimal number of frames, minFrames, to 10; set the minimal number of states of triplet, minTriplets, to 10; set the minimal diffusion constant along DNA, D_par, to 0; set the maximal estimated diffusion constant transverse to DNA, D_trans, to 10 M(bp2)S-1; set the minimal statistic parameter, Chi2_stat, to -5; set the minimal ratio of displacement along DNA to that transverse to DNA, MinX/Y, to 2.\n\tNOTE: All raw trajectories that pass these filtering parameters are listed in Table 1, and those that do not are listed in Table 3.\nClick on a trajectory number in Table 1, the trajectory will be displaced in Graphics 1 &2. Click on the \"Play\" button to play the raw fluorescence images. Click on the \"Add_to_Table2\" to identify the trajectory as a single molecule sliding trajectory. In the end, all trajectories added to Table2 will be saved when closing the GUI.\nTo calculate the mean diffusion constants, run the script \"Calculate_mean_diffusion_constant.m\". The mean diffusion constant is estimated from the set of trajectories that have passed all filtering steps and been added to Table 2."
