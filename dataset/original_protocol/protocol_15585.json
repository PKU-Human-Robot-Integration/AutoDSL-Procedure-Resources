    "1. Cleaning the LFPI cylinder\nCarefully detach the syringes attached to the transducer housing and fill port, as well as the cable connected to the pressure transducer (see Figure 1 for a schematic of injury device components).\nWhile being careful not to drop the cylinder, unscrew the hand knobs at the back of the device from the cylinder clamps to free the cylinder.\nRemove the piston at the end of the cylinder, transducer, transducer housing, and plunger O-rings.\nDrain fluid out of the cylinder.\nAdd mild detergent, such as dish washing detergent, to the cylinder and scrub lightly using a dish or bottle brush13.\nTo ensure that all the detergent is rinsed off, completely fill the cylinder with water and rinse thoroughly.\n2. Degassing the fluid used to fill the cylinder\nUse a vacuum pump to degas the fluid before refilling the cylinder to prevent the formation of new bubbles and absorb existing bubbles.\n\tNOTE: Approximately 1.5 L of fluid will be needed to fill the cylinder, although degassing approximately 2 L will leave a small supply for replacing any fluid lost during use and testing.\n\tNOTE: House vacuums are too weak to effectively degas the fluid. The vacuum must be able to produce a pressure of 25-28 inHg.\nAdd a stir bar to the fluid and place the fluid container on a stir plate. Stirring the fluid during the degassing process helps to stimulate bubbling and the release of gas. Stirring also prevents a large sudden increase in bubbling.\n\tâ€‹NOTE: The degassing process should be over when very few bubbles are being produced; this occurs after roughly 45 min.\n3. Reassembly of the LFPI device\nApply a thin layer of petroleum jelly to the piston plunger.",
    "Attach the piston plunger with the plunger protruding approximately 32 mm from the cylinder14.\n\tNOTE: Air frequently gets trapped at the plunger before the leading O-ring. To get rid of this excess air, twist the plunger while moving it in and out to work the air out of this gap.\nApply a thin layer of petroleum jelly to the other O-rings as well and attach them to the cylinder, with exception to the O-ring on the fill port.\nWrap Teflon tape twice around the transducer's threads.\n4. Refilling the LFPI device and attachment to the base\nConnect a 10 mL syringe filled with degassed fluid and free of air bubbles to the Luer lock hub on the transducer housing.\nHold the transducer with the threaded end pointing upward, and completely fill the well inside the threaded region of the transducer with the degassed fluid using a 10 mL syringe. The goal here is to fill the transducer well without introducing any air bubbles. Be careful not to damage the delicate membrane at the bottom of the transducer well.\nWith the cylinder placed at an angle to prevent air from reentering the transducer housing, attach the transducer housing to the cylinder13 and use a wrench to tighten it snugly.\nRemove the cap from the fill port and cylinder once the degassed fluid reaches approximately 2/3 of the cylinder capacity.\nPlace the cylinder horizontally and finish filling the cylinder with degassed fluid.\n\tNOTE: To avoid the formation of air bubbles, pouring the fluid in slowly is recommended14.\nReplace the cap at the fill port and close all stopcocks.\nManipulate the cylinder to work any air bubbles to the fill port14.",
    "Open the stopcock on the fill port and inject fluid using the syringe on the transducer housing to force any air bubbles out of the port14.\nInspect the entire device and ensure that there are no air bubbles.\nAdd a 10 mL syringe filled with degassed fluid to the Luer lock hub on the fill cap.\nReattach the cylinder to the base using the hand screws.\nEnsure that the cylinder is horizontal and lined up with the center of the weighted hammer on the pendulum.\nSubscription Required.
