    "1. Experimental Preparation\nPrepare the following reagents: Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (PBS); Triton X-100; 0.2% PBST (PBS + 0.2% Triton X-100); 32% paraformaldehyde (PFA), diluted into 4% before use; silicone elastomer base and curing agent; antifade mounting medium (e.g., ProLong Gold); and fingernail polish.\nPrepare the following equipment: dissection microscope, two sharp forceps and a pair of scissors for microdissection, a number of pins for microdissection, a Petri dish for making the dissection dish, microscope slides and coverslips, a confocal microscope, and a computer with Fiji ImageJ software installed.\n2. Larvae Collection\nMate UAS-Sox102F-RNAi flies with UAS-GFP, ppk-GAL4, or W1118 wild type flies, respectively. Culture flies in standard conditions at 25 °C.\nIn ~5 - 6 days, collect the third instar larvae of UAS-Sox102F-RNAi/ ppk-GAL4, UAS-GFP or UAS-GFP, and ppk-GAL4 /+ control carefully with forceps for dissection.\n3. Dissection of Larvae\nNOTE: All procedures in this section are operated under a microdissection microscope. The magnification is up to the investigators. Try to adjust to the optimal sight view. ~4 - 6X magnification is recommended.\nPlace a larva on a dissection dish made of silicone elastomer base and a tissue culture Petri dish.\nPin the larva mouth hook to allow the dorsal side to face up, and then pin the tail of larva. Place the dorsal side in the middle as much as possible to expose the midline, which will be the open-up marker.\nAdd 200 µL of PBS to the larva to maintain body moisture.\nMake a cut with a pair of scissors along the dorsal midline between the two tracheas, from caudal to rostral. Make a small cut at each of the four corners of the larva body.\nPlace a pin at each of the four corners of the body so the body lies flat.",
    "Fix the larva body wall in 4% PFA for 25 min at room temperature.\nWash in PBST for 5 min. Repeat twice more.\nRemove the pins from the tissue. Then transfer the tissue onto a glass slide, cover with antifade mounting medium, and mount with a cover slip. Air dry for 1 h and seal the edges with fingernail polish.\n4. Imaging Processing\nNOTE: Images were taken using an inverted confocal microscope system. The user can photograph the sample using a 20X objective (recommended).\nCapture Z-series images. Open the \"Capture Z-series\" dialog box in the confocal microscope software. Determine the range for capturing the Z series images.\n\t\nClick the \"Top and Bottom\" button. Determine the top and bottom position and input the values to \"Bottom:\" and \"Top:\" boxes. Set the \"Step\" in \"Capture Z-series\" dialog box as 0.5 µm. Then click the \"Run now\" button to acquire the Z-series images.\nSave the obtained images as *.tiff or *.nd2 files.\nStore the slides in a dark holder at 4 °C after imaging.\n5. Dendrite Evaluation\nNote: GFP protein was co-overexpressed in UAS-GFP and ppk-GAL4 flies in the da neurons for GFP fluorescence imaging analysis. The length, branching, and structure of da neurons in the third instar larvae were quantified. Analysis parameters include length of dendrites (µm), surface area (µm2), total number of branches, and branching structure (%). Figure 1 shows the analysis parameters in detail.\nLength of Dendrites\n\tNOTE: The length of dendrites is the sum of all dendrites labeled in tracer plugin.\n\t\nSetup and run Fiji ImageJ (https://fiji.sc/)20 software. Then split images into separate channels, if there are several channels of images.\n\t\t​NOTE: The image in this protocol only has one channel of GFP.",
    "Run \"Image | Stacks | Z project\" to get a Z projection; a new window will appear with the name 'Z-projection.' Click \"max intensity\" for projection type, and organize numbers between start slice and stop slice depending upon individual preferences. Click \"OK.\" A Z-projection image will appear presenting the dendrite projection clearly.\nTrace the neurites.\n\t\t\nSelect \"Plugins | Segmentation | Simple Neurites Tracer\" in the window to trace the dendrites. Find the neuron soma, and then click one point at a dendrite starting from the cell body, and another point at the tip of this dendrite.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The program will connect the two points with a blue line.\nPress \"Y\" in the plug-in window if the path is clear; the dendrite path is traced until the endpoints of the selected path in the visible images. Click \"complete path\" on the same plugin window; the segment is completed (Figure 2).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Some dendrites ended farther from the starting points, in which the pathway was divided into smaller segments. The segments were combined to provide a complete path for the tracer.\nAfter a path is completed, go back to a new point where the branches are. The new path can be built on; the \"All paths\" window box will show the length values of all the paths (Figure 3). Save the tracing file, and continue with unfinished traces as shown in Figure 2.\nExport the dendrite length data by clicking, \"File | Export as *.cvs\" in the 'Plugin' window. Then sum up all the path lengths, and export the data to a data analysis/spreadsheet software. (Figure 3).\nSurface Area of the da Neurons",
    "Select the Freehand drawing tool in the 'Fiji ImageJ' window. Trace the path, and then connect the endpoints. From the 'Analyze' menu, select \"Set Measurements | Area.\" Click \"measure\" from the 'Analyze' menu. The result appears in a new box with the value for the area selected (Figure 4). Copy it to the data analysis software.\nTotal Number of Branches and Branching Structure of the da Neurons\nCalculate the total number of branches by opening \"Analysis\" and then \"Render | Analyze Skeletonized Paths\" in the plugin window of tracing (Figure 5).\n\t\tNOTE: The structure of the arbor is the sum of the levels of branches. The path was defined between the cell body and the dendrite tips, and one path can include multiple branches, such as the primary arbors are the dendrites from the neuron cell body. The secondary arbors are branches from the primary and so on with the tertiary, quaternary, and quinary arbors. The structure of dendrite branching is separated depending on the levels of branches. For instance, the primary % is the number of branches divided by total number of branching, and so on.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
