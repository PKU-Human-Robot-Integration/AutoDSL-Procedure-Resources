    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation for craniotomy\nTiming: 30 min\nThis section describes the surgical steps to prepare the mouse skull for craniotomy.\nAnesthetize the adult mouse (> 2 months old) in a chamber filled with 3% isoflurane in oxygen.\nClamp the nose of the mouse on the stereotaxic instrument (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). Isoflurane (1%–1.5% in oxygen) is provided from the nose clamp during the surgery. The body temperature is maintained by a servo-controlled heating pad.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1599-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation for craniotomy\n(A) A mouse is fixed by a nose clamp.\n(B) After opening the skin. The muscles above the cerebellum skull (dashed circles) will be detached next.\n(C) The muscles above the cerebellum have been detached. The lateral muscles near the auditory cortex (dashed circles) will be detached next.\n(D) After detaching both muscles.\n(E) Connective tissue on the skull surface was scraped off using a scalpel.\n(F) After cleaning the skull surface with 70% ethanol.\nInject baytril (10 mg/kg) and dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) subcutaneously to prevent possible infection and inflammation.\nDisinfect the head skin with 70% ethanol and betadine.\nCover eyes with Vaseline to keep eyes from drying.\nCut out and remove the skin above the skull with scissors. Expose the dorsal skull above the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum.\nClean the skull surface using Kimwipe soaked with 70% ethanol.\nDetach muscles on the lateral edges of cerebellum to increase skull surface area (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B and 2C). Leave the detached muscles posterior to the skull.\nDetach lateral muscles near auditory cortex to increase skull surface area (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D).\nLeave the detached muscles at the original place.\nKrazy glue and dental cement will be placed in the ‘pocket’ between the lateral muscle and the skull in steps 33 and 34.",
    "Critical: These steps of increasing skull surface area are critical to secure a head bar on the skull in later steps because a large portion of the dorsal skull will be removed for the ultra large cranial window.\nScrape off the connective tissue on the skull surface using a scalpel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nNote: Make sure to completely remove the connective tissue. Remaining tissue loosens the head bar attachment in later steps.\nClean the skull surface using Kimwipe soaked with 70% ethanol (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nMarking the stereotaxic coordinates\nTiming: 40 min\nThis section describes the steps to mark the stereotaxic coordinates on the mouse skull. A photo with the marks and the cortical vasculature patterns will be used to find the target cortical areas during two-photon imaging.\nLevel the skull using the stereotaxic instrument.\nUse a needle fixed on a motorized micromanipulator to measure the height at each coordinate (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1599-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Marking the stereotaxic coordinates\n(A) A needle on a manipulator will be used to measure the coordinate from the bregma.\n(B) A rough marking with a permanent pen. The white dot on the ink (highlighted by a red circle) was marked by sticking the needle to confirm the accurate coordinate.\n(C) Extra ink was removed by a drill to make sure that the correct coordinate is at the center of the ink.\n(D) After marking all coordinates. Note that the midline sinus and the midline suture line are slightly misaligned in this mouse around the posterior cortex. The ML coordinates for the posterior areas started from the midline sinus instead of the suture line for this animal.",
    "(E) The skull was made semi-transparent by saline application, visualizing the vasculature patterns on the dorsal cortex. A photo of this image will be used as a reference to find target imaging areas under a two-photon microscope.\nEqualize the heights between the bregma and the lambda and the heights between ±2 mm lateral from the bregma.\nMark the following coordinates on the skull using a water-resistant permanent marker. [Anteroposterior (AP) coordinate from bregma, Mediolateral (ML) coordinate from bregma] = [0 mm, 0 mm], [±1.0 mm, 0 mm], [±2.0 mm, 0 mm], [±3.0 mm, 0 mm], [0 mm, ±1.0 mm], [0 mm, ±2.0 mm], [-2.0 mm, ±1.0 mm], [-2.0 mm, ±2.0 mm].\nNote: These marking coordinates can be changed based on the size of craniotomy and target cortical areas. We recommend including at least 2 lines that span along ML axis so that we can interpolate the missing coordinates within the cranial window.\nFind each coordinate using the needle.\nMark the coordinate using the marker (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nConfirm the coordinate by sticking the needle down to the ink.\nRemove extra ink by a drill (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). The needle mark from step c needs to be at the center of the ink mark. Although the manually marked coordinates at step b are not very accurate, this extra drilling step improves the accuracies.\nNote: Midline sinus is occasionally misaligned with the midline suture on the skull (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D and 3E). Confirm the alignment by making the skull semi-transparent by placing a drop of saline and wait for ∼30 s. If large misalignment is found, the ML coordinates for the marks should begin from the midline sinus under the skull instead of the suture line at each AP coordinate.",
    "Cover the dorsal skull with saline and wait for at least 30 s to make the skull semi-transparent.\nTake a photo of the semi-transparent skull with the marked coordinates and the vasculatures on the cortex (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nNote: Older mice occasionally have thicker skulls, and their skulls may not become transparent enough to visualize the cortical vasculatures. If the transparency is not sufficient, thin the skull by drilling until you get sufficient transparency.\nUltra large craniotomy and window implantation\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis section describes the steps to make a large cranial window that exposes most of the dorsal cortex.\nWash the glass plug with saline.\nPlace the glass plug on the skull to check the necessary craniotomy size for the window implantation.\nNote: The craniotomy size needs to be larger than the protrusion glass.\nTake off the glass plug and thin the skull along the edges of the intended cranial window using a drill (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1599-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Ultra large craniotomy and window implantation\n(A) The dorsal skull is thinned along the edges of the cranial window and the suture lines. The skull needs to be thinned until the underlying vasculature pattern becomes clearly visible as shown in the zoomed image.\n(B) The split bones will be removed in the ascending order from #1 to #4. Grab the bone with forceps and slowly slide it toward the arrow direction on the image.\n(C) After removal of the bones. Dura is kept intact.\n(D) A glass plug is pressed on the cortex, and the position is fixed with 3M Vetbond and Krazy glue.\n(E) After the glass implantation.",
    "No need to mark the outline of the window on the skull, but frequently place the glass plug on the skull during skull thinning to make sure that the size of your craniotomy is sufficient for the glass window.\nUse a compressed air duster to clear the skull debris.\nNote: Do not penetrate the skull with a drill. Thin the skull as much as possible without exposing the brain. To stop bleeding, place a saline-soaked gelatin sponge on the bleeding site.\nThin the skull along the midline and coronal suture lines (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nCritical: The skull along the suture lines are especially sticky to the dura. Dura will be damaged if you skip this step when the skull is removed in later step. Skull thinning followed by saline exposure makes it easier to detach the skull from the dura and the sinus.\nCover the dorsal skull with saline and wait for at least 1 min.\nNote: This step makes the skull less sticky to the dura.\nRemove the skull in the order of left parietal bone, right parietal bone, left frontal bone, and right frontal bone by the following procedure (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B and 4C). Keep saline on the skull throughout these steps.\nCarefully and slowly lift the bone from its edge using the fine forceps.\nDetach the bone except along the midline sinus which is particularly sticky to the bone.\nGrab the bone with the forceps and slowly slide it to the side for its removal (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nStop bleeding by placing gelatin sponges on the bleeding sites.\nNote: The bone should be detached from the sinus by sliding laterally. The sinus will be damaged if the bone is pulled upward.",
    "Note: The frontal bones are stickier to the dura than the parietal bone. If the bones do not easily detach from the dura, carefully slide in the fine forceps between the bone and the dura.\nNote: We leave the dura intact to minimize inflammation.\nClean the glass plug with saline and Kimwipe.\nPlace the glass plug on the exposed cortex.\nPush the glass plug down using the micromanipulator (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]D). We use a sharpened wooden bar that is attached to the manipulator.\nNote: We do not need to push the full ∼440 μm height of the protrusion glass into the cranial window in most cases unless the skull is very thick. However, adding gentle pressure to the brain at this step is critical for stable two-photon calcium imaging from the cortical areas near the midline sinus of behaving mice. If the pressure is too weak, the midline sinus dilates and pushes the medial cortical areas such as the retrosplenial cortex when mice move during the behavior task. However, the pressure should not be so much that it blocks the blood flow in the sinus. The pressure should be adjusted based on the blood flow. We did not observe obvious effects on neural activity from this procedure.\nRemove extra saline between the base glass and the skull using Kimwipe.\nFill the gap between the base glass and the skull with 3M Vetbond using a syringe, and wait for at least 30 s.\nRemove extra 3M Vetbond using Kimwipe.\nPut Krazy glue (cyanoacrylate glue) around the edges of the window using a syringe with a 25G needle.\nLift the wooden bar after making sure that the glass plug is stably glued to the skull (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]E). It should be stable even before the Krazy glue dries.",
    "Fixing the head bar and the cranial window\nTiming: 40 min\nThis section describes the steps to fixate the head bar and the cranial window using Krazy glue and dental acrylic cement. Use a syringe with 25G needle for Krazy glue, and use double-ended carver to mix and apply cement.\nCover the exposed muscles behind the cerebellum with a thin layer of Krazy glue and mount dental acrylic cement until the height becomes roughly equal to the skull above the cerebellum (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1599-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Fixing the head bar and the cranial window\n(A) Dental cement is mounted on the back muscle until it reaches the height of the cerebellum skull.\n(B) Head bar is glued on the cement and skull.\n(C) All exposed skull surface is covered by Krazy glue.\n(D) Dental cement is mounted on the skull to make a wall.\n(E) Cranial windows immediately after the surgery (left) and 6 days after the surgery (right). Note that the residual bleeding immediately after the surgery has cleared.\nPlace the head bar behind the glass window (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B).\nAfter making sure that the head bar is roughly parallel to the skull, apply Krazy glue to secure the position of the head bar.\nCover all exposed skull with Krazy glue, including the lateral areas that were exposed in step 9 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C).\nApply dental cement using double-ended carver.\nMake a wall around the glass window by repeatedly applying the Krazy glue and the dental cement (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nNote: The head bar also needs to be covered to achieve sufficient stability during imaging.\nNote: The wall height is matched to the height of the head bar in our preparation, but it can be adjusted if working distance of the objective lens is the limiting factor.",
    "Note: The first layer on the skull surface and the head bar should be always the Krazy glue instead of the dental cement because the dental acrylic cement does not strongly stick to the skull.\nInject buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) subcutaneously.\nAfter the cement dries, clean the glass window with a cotton swab soaked in 70% ethanol and take a photo of the cranial window (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]E). This photo and another photo from step 15 will be used to find the target cortical areas during two-photon imaging.\nTransfer the mouse to an animal cage and leave the cage on a heating pad until the mouse recovers from anesthesia. If water-restriction is necessary for the animal training, give at least 5 days of recovery after surgery before starting the water-restriction.\nPerform two-photon calcium imaging from the target cortical areas\nTiming: 15 min (excluding the imaging and the image registration time)\nThis section describes the steps to find the target cortical areas and perform two-photon calcium imaging.\nFind the cortical vasculature patterns within the target field-of-views (FOVs).\nCheck the vasculature patterns within the target FOVs on the photo from the step 15 (Coordinate photo).\nFind the corresponding vasculature patterns on the photo from the step 37 (Post-surgery photo).\nHead-fix the mouse under the two-photon microscope (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A and 6B).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1599-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Preparation for two-photon imaging\n(A) Head-fixation stage under a two-photon microscope. The animal stage is rotatable.\n(B) High zoom image of a head-fixed mouse.",
    "(C) Angular discrepancy between the focal plane and the glass window can be checked by the reflected light on the glass window. Light will be reflected along a line when there is angular mismatch, while the light will be uniformly reflected on the glass when the angles are matched. Adjust the angles of both the animal stage and the objective lens to achieve uniform light reflection on the glass window.\n(D) Measure the rotational angle of the microscope (objective lens) using an angle gauge for reproducibility.\n(E) Measure the horizontal angle of the animal stage for reproducibility.\nNote: If the mouse is not pre-trained under head-fixation, we recommend habituating the mouse to the head-fixed condition at least for a few days before collecting calcium imaging data.\nPerform two-photon imaging with a water-immersion objective lens.\nFind the vasculature patterns of the target FOVs by referencing the photos from the step 39.\nAdjust the angles of the animal stage and the objective lens to make the glass window perpendicular to the light path through the objective lens.\nTo find the angular discrepancy between the glass window and the objective lens, image the glass window while repeatedly moving the z-depth of the focal plane up and down around the window.\nThe excitation light will be reflected along a line when there is an angular discrepancy, and the moving direction of the line during the movement of z-depth tells the directions to which the angles of the animal stage and the objective lens need to be corrected (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nAfter correcting the angular discrepancy, the excitation light will be uniformly reflected on the glass window.\nMove the objective lens down to the target depth.\nStart the calcium imaging (e.g., ScanImage for data acquisition) and the behavior task.",
    "After imaging, record the angles of the animal stage and the objective lens (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D and 6E).\nRemove the motion artifacts and distortions from saved images using image registration algorithms such as PatchWarp (Hattori and Komiyama, 2022b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nTrack the identical neural population across sessions for longitudinal analyses\nTiming: 15 min (excluding the imaging time)\nThis section describes the steps to find the identical neural population between different imaging sessions for longitudinal analyses.\nCreate a reference image of each target FOV by averaging all frames of the registered images from a reference session. PatchWarp automatically generates the reference image at the step 47.\nSet the angles of the animal stage and the objective lens to the recorded angles from the step 46.\nFind the target FOV based on the cortical vasculature patterns and move the focus down to the same depth as before.\nCompare the current FOV with the FOV in the reference image, and adjust the imaging depth and the animal stage angle.\nNote: Vasculatures are more reliable landmarks than neurons for the FOV matching, because only neurons that are currently active are often visible with GCaMP signals.\nNote: The FOVs do not need to match completely because the FOVs from different imaging sessions can be registered post-hoc (e.g., Across-session registration function of PatchWarp).\nStart the calcium imaging and the behavior task."
