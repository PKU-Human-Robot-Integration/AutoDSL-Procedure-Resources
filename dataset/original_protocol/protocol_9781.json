    "1. Device fabrication\nMake the designs for the microencapsulation device and dissociation device using CAD software10,11.\nSpin-coat the three layers of SU-8 photoresist sequentially on a silicon wafer (Figure 2A) to achieve structures with the desired heights: 60, 100, and 150 µm.\n\tNOTE: The process for the top and bottom molds is identical.\n\t\nSpin coat a clean 10 cm silicon wafer with SU-8 2025 negative photoresist at 1,100 rpm to create the first 60 µm layer. After a soft bake at 65 °C for 3 min and 95 °C for 10 min on a hot plate, expose the mold using a maskless aligner by uploading the design file of the core channel pattern to the µPG 101 PC. Then, proceed with the post-exposure bake at 65 °C for 3 min and at 95 °C for 10 min.\nSpin coat the second SU-8 2025 layer (40 µm) at 1,500 rpm and expose by uploading the appropriate CAD file for the shell channel pattern.\n\t\tNOTE: Soft and post-exposure bakes were similar to the previous step.\nSpin coat the third SU-8 2025 layer at 1,400 rpm to achieve 50 µm height and repeat the above process but expose the structures for the oil phase.\nDevelop the mold with all three layers in a single step by submersion in SU-8 developer until all the unexposed photoresist is removed.\nHard bake the mold on a hot plate at 160 °C for 10 min to improve adhesion and seal minor cracks that could appear after the development.\nExpose the mold to chlorotrimethylsilane to avoid elastomer bonding in the next step and place it in 15 cm Petri dishes until use.",
    "Prepare the dissociation device mold in the same manner, as described in Figure 1D and Figure 2B. Spin coat one layer of SU-8 photoresist on a silicon wafer, as described earlier in step 1.2.3, to achieve structures with the desired height: 50 µm. Conduct the soft and post-exposure bake, development, and hard bake similarly to the previous step.\n\tNOTE: An array of triangular-shaped posts covered the whole chamber, with spacing between posts decreasing as chamber width decreased toward the outlet. Triangle posts were 200 µm per side with a pitch ranging from 400 µm (at the inlet) to 30 µm (at the outlet).\nPrepare the molds by soft lithography using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).\n\t\nMix PDMS elastomer base and elastomer curing agent in a 10:1 w/w ratio in a planetary centrifuge. Pour the mixture onto both microencapsulation master molds and dissociation master mold to create a 3-4 mm layer.\n\t\tNOTE: A mixture of 50 g of elastomer base with 5 g of curing agent is sufficient to cover a master mold with 3 mm thickness.\nPlace the Petri dishes containing the molds in a vacuum desiccator for 15 min to de-gas the uncured PDMS.\nMove the Petri dishes to an oven and bake at 80 °C for a minimum of 60 min.\nRemove the master molds from the oven and allow them to cool down. Using a precision knife, carefully cut the PDMS following the shape of the wafer and peel out the PDMS pieces from the master mold.\nCut out the PDMS slabs by trimming the edges of each device with a scalpel, then punch out inlet/outlet fluidic ports in the dissociation device and only in the top microfluidic device using stainless steel needles. Cover the devices with magic tape to avoid contamination.",
    "NOTE: The needle gauge is 14 G and 15 G for inlet and outlet ports, respectively.\nFor bonding, treat the patterned sides of the top and bottom PDMS pieces with O2 plasma on a plasma etcher for 2 min.\nAlign both PDMS parts under a stereoscope after adding a thin separating layer of distilled water directly in the microchannels (2 µL).\nPlace the aligned PDMS device in the oven at 80 °C overnight to complete the bonding and restore the PDMS to its original hydrophobic state. Store the devices until further use.\n\t\tNOTE: This results in a coaxial flow-focusing device with three different heights of 120 µm for core, 200 µm for shell, and 300 µm for oil channels.\nIn order to use the device right after the plasma bonding, carefully but firmly inject 30 µL of hydrophobic coating solution into the fluidic channels to achieve hydrophobic coating. Then, immediately purge air into the channels until no residues of the hydrophobic coating solution are observed in the device.\nBond the dissociation device by first treating the patterned side of the device and a cleaned slide glass with O2 plasma for 2 min, and then assemble them for further curing in the oven at 80 °C overnight.\n\t\t​NOTE: Devices can be stored until further use.\n2. Preparation of solutions\nStock solutions. First, prepare stock solutions (concentrated solutions) that will be diluted to lower concentrations for actual use.\n\tNOTE: Stock solutions are used to save preparation time, conserve materials, reduce storage space, and improve accuracy when preparing a working solution in lower concentrations.",
    "Prepare 30 mL of 2x core solution (16% PEG and 34% density gradient media): mix 4.8 g of 35 kDa PEG, 10.2 mL of density gradient media, and 19.8 mL of DMEM/F12 media. Filter this core solution using a 0.22 μm syringe filter.\nPrepare 50 mL of mineral oil with 3% surfactant: mix 48.5 mL of mineral oil and 1.5 mL of surfactant. Keep in a sterile condition after filtration through a 0.22 µm syringe filter.\nPrepare 50 mL of mineral oil with 0.5% surfactant: mix 49.75 mL of mineral oil and 0.25 mL of surfactant. Keep in a sterile condition.\nPrepare 1 M Dithiotheritol (DTT): dissolve 1.5425 g of DTT in 10 mL distilled water. Keep in a sterile condition.\nPrepare 1 M Triethanolamine (TEA): add 66.4 µL of TEA in 433.6 µL of distilled water. Keep in a sterile condition.\nPrepare 1% Pluronic F127 (PF127): dissolve 100 mg of PF127 in 10 mL of distilled water. Keep in a sterile condition.\nWorking solutions\n\t\nPrepare a crosslinker emulsion by mixing 4.5 mL of mineral oil with 3% surfactant and 300 µL of 1 M DTT (1:15 ratio). Vortex the solution for 2 min and sonicate for 45-60 min in an ultrasonic bath at 20 °C. Load this solution to a 5 mL syringe with a 27 G needle.\n\t\tNOTE: Emulsion is generated by sonicating oil/water mixture.\nPrepare shielding oil solution by loading the mineral oil with 0.5% surfactant to a 5 mL syringe with a 27 G needle.",
    "Prepare shell (8% w/v PEG-4-Mal and 15 mM TEA) solution by adding 32 mg of PEG-4-Mal in 400 µL of 1x DPBS to form 8% w/v solution, and vortex the solution for 2 min. Then, add 6 µL of 1 M TEA (final concentration 15 mM TEA). Finally, centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 5 min through a spin-filter and keep it in the dark on the rocker for 30 min. Then, load this solution to a 1 mL syringe with a 27 G needle.\n\t\tNOTE: Leave the PEG-4-Mal container to sit at room temperature for 10 min before opening the lid, and blow N2 gas to replace the O2 with N2 before closing the lid. Vortex TEA before adding to the solution.\nPrepare the cell suspension in core solution\n\t\nTreat the hPSCs with trypsin for 5 to 10 min at 37 °C. Then, collect them from plates. Quench the trypsin with the medium after cell detachment, and then transfer the cells to a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge the bulk cell suspension (400 x g, 5 min). Carefully aspirate the supernatant and then resuspend the cell pellet using a minimal volume of growth medium. Count the cells using an automated cell counter.\n\t\tNOTE: Typical cell aliquots contain 12-20 x 106 cells and are enough to make 400 µL of the core solution.\nTake 12-20 x 106 cells from the bulk cell suspension and centrifuge the cell/media suspension (400 x g, 5 min).\nCarefully aspirate media from the cell pellet. Then, add 200 µL media and 200 µL of 2x PEG solution (final concentration 30-50 x 106 cell/mL) and mix gently.\n\t\tNOTE: Low cell concentrations (less than 20 x 106 cells/mL) resulted in many empty capsules.\nAdd 30 µL of 1% PF127 to the solution.",
    "Insert a micro stirrer bar (2 mm x 7 mm) into a 1 mL syringe, and then load the cell containing core solution to the syringe with a 27 G needle. Keep the solution cold with ice during the whole encapsulation process.\n3. Experimental setup\nPlace bonded PDMS droplet device, four pieces of 20 cm long and one piece of 5 cm long inlet micro tubes (0.38 mm I.D. x 1.1 mm O.D.), one piece of 10 cm outlet tube (0.5 mm I.D. x 1.5 mm O.D.), and six pieces of 0.5 cm fitting tubes (1 mm I.D. x 1.8 mm O.D.) beneath a germicidal light source (typically built into biological safety cabinets) and sterilize for 30 min.\nUse forceps to fit the tubing into the fluidic inlet ports and the dissociation ports.\nUse the three pieces of 20 cm long inlet microtubes for the shell, oil, crosslinker emulsion inlets, and one piece for the inlet of the dissociation device. Then, insert the opposite end of the tubes to the needle of the syringe with the corresponding solution. Meanwhile, connect the core inlet of the microfluidic device and the outlet of the dissociation device with one 5 cm microtube (Figure 1C).\n\tNOTE: The inlet microtubes should be tightly secured within the fitting tubes, which were inserted in the last step.\nInsert one outlet tube into the fluidic outlet port and place the opposite end into a collection reservoir.\nPlace the device on a microscope stage and attach the tubing to avoid moving. Align and focus the microscope on the device nozzle for flow inspection.",
    "Place each syringe on different syringe pumps and secure properly (Figure 1B). Program each pump according to manufacturer's protocols to the following flow rates: core (3-5 µL/min), shell (3-5 µL/min), shielding oil (20-80 µL/min), and crosslinking oil (40-60 µL/min). Start the flow in all pumps.\nWait for each fluid to enter the device and fill up the channels while pushing out the remaining air.\n\tNOTE: If there is a large amount of air in the inlet tubing, temporarily increase each flow rate until the air is completely removed. Be mindful that excessive flow rate could lead to PDMS-to-PDMS bond failure.\nWhen the capsule formation is stabilized (Figure 3), place the opposite end of the collection tube to a new conical tube with 5 mL of mTeSR media.\n\tNOTE: The media contains 10 μM ROCK inhibitor, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin.\nAfter a sufficient number of capsules are collected, incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 10 min. Capsules residing in the oil phase will be at the top of the tube (see Figure 4A). Gently tapping on the tube causes capsules to sediment to the bottom. After this, most of the oil and media may be aspirated.\nCollect the capsules from the bottom of the conical tube, place them on a cell strainer (100 μm pore size), and wash with copious amounts of media. Then, collect microcapsules using 2 mL media in a 6-well culture plate by running the media through the filter as it is inverted on top of the well-plate (see Figure 4A).\n4. hPSC culture and analysis in microcapsules\nBasic culture\n\t\nIncubate the stem cell capsules in a 6-well plate culture dish at 37 °C with 5% CO2.",
    "Change the media every other day by collecting the capsules on a cell strainer filter, washing them with excess media, and resuspending them to a new well in 6-well plates with 2 mL media as was done in step 3.10.\nCulture the capsules for at least 10 days.\nPerform the live/dead assay to determine viability of encapsulated stem cells.\n\t\nThaw live/dead assay solutions (ethidium homodimer-1 and calcein AM).\nAdd 4 µL of the 2 μM ethidium homodimer-1 and 1 µL of the 4 μM calcein AM solutions to 2 mL of sterile DPBS. Vortex to ensure complete mixing.\nCollect approximately 100 microcapsules on a cell strainer and rinse them with sterile DPBS to allow diffusion of medium out from the capsules.\nCollect them again to a 12 well culture plate by using 1 mL of the solution prepared in step 4.2.2. Incubate at 37 °C for 20 min.\nVisualize the cells under a fluorescence microscope.\n\t\tNOTE: Cell viability is quantified by calculating the percentage of live cells, which are visualized as green, among the total number of cells.\nSpheroid size characterization.\n\t\nWhen desired, place the well plate with microcapsules under the microscope and measure the diameter of spheroids shown on the related software with proper scale bars.\nMeasure and analyze the spheroid size.\nSubscription Required.
