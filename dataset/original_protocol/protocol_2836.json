This method relies on the different densities of blood components for their separation in distinct phases. The Ficoll solution allows the partition of erythrocytes and polynuclear cells at the lower part of the tube due to their density being higher than Ficoll while plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) lay on top of it. Monocytes (CD14+ cells) can then be isolated from PBMCs by positive magnetic sorting. Subsequently they can be differentiated into human primary macrophages, hMDMs, by culturing them in the presence of recombinant human M-CSF (rh-MCSF) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2541-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Generation of human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs)\nCell isolation: Separation of PBMCs from whole blood (or buffy coat).\nDilute blood with equal volume of PBS (at room temperature, RT).\nAdd 15 mL of Lymphocytes Separation Medium in 50 mL Falcon tubes (RT).\nPipette slowly 30 mL of PBS-diluted blood over the separation medium, be careful not to mix both phases.\nNote: For volumes less than 30 mL of PBS-diluted blood, use a Ficoll to blood ratio of 1:2 and adjust all volumes accordingly.\nCentrifuge tubes for 30 min at RT and 300 × g, with an acceleration of 2 and without breaks.\nRetrieve plasma and the PBMC layers (the white band above the Ficoll band, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]), transfer to new separate 50 mL tubes and add PBS to a final volume of 45 mL.\nCentrifuge cells during 10 min at 300 × g and 10°C.\nDiscard supernatant, pool all pellets, add PBS to a final volume of 45 mL and centrifuge cells during 10 min at 300 × g and 10°C.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 2 mL of cold MACS buffer and count the cells with Trypan Blue.\nTransfer the cells to a 15 mL falcon tube, spin down the cells and resuspend in 8 μL of MACS buffer for each   1 ∗   10 6    cells.\nIncubate the cells on ice for 5 min to prevent the internalization of CD14 magnetic beads by the phagocytic cells.\nCell isolation: Separation of Monocytes from PBMCS by positive magnetic sorting.\nAdd CD14 magnetic beads to the cells with a volume of 2 μL for each   1 ∗   10 6    cells.\nIncubate at 4°C for 15 min with gentle agitation on a roller shaker set at 40 rpm.\nAdd 5 mL of MACS buffer right after incubation to dilute the beads and avoid non-specific binding.\nCentrifuge cells during 10 min at 300 × g at 10°C. In the meantime, prepare the column and magnet by placing the column on the magnet and the filter on top of the column.\nWash column with 3 mL of MACS buffer.\nRemove supernatant after centrifuging and resuspend the pellet in 5 μL of MACS buffer for each   1 ∗   10 6    cells then directly transfer the cells on the column.\nWait until the last drop and then proceed with 3 washes of the column with 3 mL of MACS buffer.\nRemove column from the magnet and, at a recommended distance of 30 cm from the magnetic field, add 5 mL of MACS buffer to the column and flush the contents with a plunger into a 15 mL tube.\nAdd cells to a new column without filter and repeat steps e, g, and h.\nCritical: Using two columns improves the purity of the cells and avoids the presence of red blood cells.\nCount cells.",
    "Centrifuge cells during 10 min at 300 × g at 10°C and discard supernatant.\nCell culture: Differentiation of Monocytes into Macrophages.\nPrepare medium for differentiation; X-VIVO-15 or RPMI10%FBS supplemented with 25 ng/mL of rh-MCSF and warm it up to 37°C.\nPlate cells either in 10 cm Nunc™ UpCell™ dishes (maximum of   8 ∗   10 6    in 12 mL) or in 6-well Nunc™ UpCell™ plates (maximum of   1 ∗   10 6    cells in 2 mL per well) depending on the obtained cell count.\nCritical: The detachment technique is important to maintain the cell-integrity of the macrophages. Using thermosensible dishes such as Nunc™ UpCell™ plates greatly enhances cell viability and integrity after detachment.\nKeep cells in a humidified incubator at 37°C + 5% CO2,\nThree days after plating the cells, add 6 mL of pre-warmed rh-MCSF supplemented culture medium to a 10 cm dish or 1 mL to a well of a 6-well plate.\nWait until day 6–7 after plating to obtain fully differentiated macrophages.\nPlace plates at 20°C for 20 min inside an incubator or at RT on a bench-top for the cells to detach. Cells can be left at RT for up to 40 min if required for improved detachment.\nCollect half of the supernatant and place it in a 15 mL Falcon tube.\nFlush the dish or the well with the remaining medium to further detach the cells and collect them in the falcon tube.\nAdd 5 mL and 1 mL of PBS to the dish and well, respectively and repeat the flushing step.\nCollect the supernatant, check with the microscope for good detachment of the cells. Repeat step h if necessary.\nSpin down harvested cells at 400 × g for 10 min at RT, resuspend in preferred culture medium without phenol red and count cells.",
    "Pause point: One can continue with the experiment or stop at this point and freeze the hMDMs in 1 mL of CryoStor® CS10 freezing medium or in 1 mL of 10% DMSO in FCS, at a cell concentration between   0.5   and   10 ∗   10 6    cells/mL. Differentiated hMDMs can be conserved in liquid nitrogen for several months.\nPreparation of bacteria\nTiming: 4 days\nInfection of macrophages is conducted with fluorescent-protein expressing strains in order to track infection and replication dynamics during the whole time-course of infection. Here, Legionella pneumophila, a gram-negative intracellular bacterium responsible for the Legionnaire’s disease, is used to infect hMDMs. Legionella pneumophila has a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that injects bacterial effectors into host cells to subvert several cellular processes including mitochondrial parameters such as the mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and cell death.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]\nThe strain used Is L. pneumophila Strain Paris (Lpp) containing the pNT28 plasmid,4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] which constitutively expresses GFP and has a resistance cassette to chloramphenicol (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2541-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Preparation of bacteria and hMDM infection\nStreak L. pneumophila strains taken from the −80°C glycerol stock on Charcoal Yeast Extract (BCYE) agar and incubate the plate for 3 days at 37°C.\nInoculate 10 mL Buffered Yeast Extract (BYE) liquid medium at OD600 = 0,1 the day prior to the infection and allow bacteria to grow overnight while shaking at 37°C at an rpm of 200 rpm until OD600 reaches about 4,2.\nMonitor the bacteria under the light microscope to check they are motile, indicating that the flagella are expressed and hence that the bacteria are in the infectious state.",
    "Aliquot 2 mL of the bacterial culture, measure OD600. To calculate the number of bacteria in the culture, use an OD600 = 2,5 which is representing a concentration of   2,2  ∗   10 9    bacteria/mL. Dilute the bacteria in the final cell culture medium to obtain a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10.\nPlating & infection of hMDMs with fluorescent bacteria\nTiming: 2 days\nPlating of hMDMs (a day before the infection) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nAdjust the concentration of the cells to 200 000 cells/mL using culture media and add in a 384-well plate 50 μL per well to obtain a final concentration of about 10 000 cells per well. This density of cells is adequate in terms of numbers but also for segmentation during image analysis.\nLeave the cells to attach overnight.\nNote: This protocol can be adapted to 96-well plates by adjusting the cell number to 300 000 cells/mL and the assay volumes to 100 μL (30 000 cells per well).\nInfection of hMDMs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nWash the hMDMs twice by removing 40 μL of the medium and then gently flushing the attached cells with the same volume of fresh phenol red-free culture medium. Keep the final volume in the well to 50 μL.\nRemove 25 μL from all wells and add 25 μL of a 2× bacterial suspension to wells meant to be infected and culture media to the others. MOI = 10.\nSpin the plate at 200 g for 5 min at RT to synchronize infection. This is considered the T = 0 of the infection.\nIncubate the plate at 37°C for 5 min in a water-bath and 25 min in a humidified incubator at 37°C + 5% CO2.",
    "Critical: Incubation of the plate in the water-bath after infection increases phagocytosis of bacteria by macrophages.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] It is important to use a support to stabilize the plate inside the water-bath as well as to properly adjust the water level of the water-bath. Only the bottom of the plate should be on the surface of the water without reaching the lid of the plate.\nWash cells three times as described above to remove extracellular bacteria and proceed with the staining.\nStaining of hMDMs\nTiming: 30 min\nTo measure mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and early cell death during infection, macrophages are stained with Tetramethylrhodamin, methyl ester perchlorate (TMRM) and with Annexin-V Alexa Fluor 647 conjugate, respectively. TMRM is retained inside mitochondria in a ΔΨm dependent manner, and its fluorescence is proportional to the ΔΨm. An OXPHOS uncoupler such as FCCP (10 μM) can be used as a control for mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Annexin-V is binding phosphatidylserine that is a marker of cell death when it is on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Cells are also stained with Hoechst 33342, a DNA marker used to detect nuclei of living cells.\nPrepare the 2× dye mix to a final concentration of 200 ng/mL of Hoechst H33342, 10 nM of TMRM, and 1/100 Annexin-V- Alexa Fluor 647 in prewarmed phenol red-free culture medium. This can be performed during the previous incubation step.\nRemove 25 μL of culture medium and add 25 μL of the 2× dye mix.\nIncubate 30 min at 37°C / 5% CO2 (1 h post infection). Proceed with image acquisition.\nNote: The staining solution is not washed and remains in the wells during the whole assay, as cells would need to take up the dyes if there are changes in the measured parameters.\nAutomatic acquisition of confocal images",
    "Timing: 17 h\nFor fluorescent live imaging we used an automated microlens-enhanced spinning disc confocal microscope (Opera Phenix™ High Content Screening System, PerkinElmer) equipped with a 63× water objective, excitation lasers at 405, 488, 561, and 640 nm, and emission filters at 450, 540, 600, and 690 nm, respectively. The microscope system is controlled by the Harmony software v.4.9 (PerkinElmer).\nStabilize the incubation chamber of the microscope at 37°C / 5% CO2 (This can take an hour if the chamber was not heated before).\nLoad the 384-well plate.\nSet up the experiment by adjusting the focus and the exposure time/intensity of the lasers for each channel.\nProgram the acquisition to image multiple fields (from 9 to 25) per well, every hour, starting at 1 h post-infection until 18 h post-infection (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2541-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Automatic image acquisition\nScale bar: 30 μm.\nStart acquisition at least 30 min after staining to obtain a proper fluorescence intensity from Hoechst dye.\nCritical: In order to properly sort extracted data during image analysis, it is important to fill the plate layout in the software according to your plate map.\nImage analysis\nTiming: Can vary from 1 h to overnight",
    "Acquired images need to be translated into datasets that allow quantitative analysis of measured parameters. For this, automatic high-content image analysis is performed. Here, Perkin Elmer’s High-Content Imaging and Analysis software Harmony® is used. A script is written from pre-programmed blocks that are available in the software. Alternatively, other similar software such as CellProfiler (open-access) can also be used. The most important point for the precise analysis of the parameters measured is the segmentation of cellular and subcellular parameters. For this purpose, the fluorescent signal of the staining is used. An example of the analysis building blocks is depicted in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and associated images are shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2541-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Image analysis workflow – Building blocks\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2541-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Image analysis workflow – Images\nScale bar: 30 μm.\nAnalysis workflow:\nSegment nuclei.\nStart analysis by calculating a mask of nuclei from the input image (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], step 1) using the Hoechst signal in the 405/450 channel. This nuclei mask becomes a new channel (“calculated image nuclei”, step 2).\nFind and identify nuclei using the “calculated image nuclei” channel (step 3).\nCalculate morphological properties of identified nuclei to filter out objects that were wrongly selected. By using nuclei roundness and area, we can eliminate artefacts from the analysis (step 4).\nCritical: Make sure to check several timepoints when filtering out objects to avoid being too strict and thus loose events that are not artefacts.\nAt this point you obtain the “real nuclei” population based on the selected nuclei.\nSegment cytoplasm.\nCreate a mask for the cellular cytoplasm by creating a new channel that sums up TMRM and Annexin V signals in the 561/600 and 640/690 channels (step 5).",
    "Verify that the cytoplasm is well segmented by testing the different detection methods provided by the software as ready-to-use processing modules. In the case of Harmony software, the cytoplasm detection method “A” normally works well.\nNote: In order to properly segment the whole cytoplasm of infected cells, you can also consider adding GFP to create this new channel as bacterial vacuoles sometimes take a large part of the cytoplasm at the end of the infection.\nDetect the cytoplasm region among the “real nuclei” population created in the previous step using the mask of cellular cytoplasm (step 6).\nResize the regions selected as cytoplasm to 30% to completely encompass each cell (step 7).\nMeasure fluorescent parameters.\nMeasure the intensity in the 561/600 channel for TMRM (mean and SD) (step 8).\nCalculate SD/Mean for TMRM (step 8).\nNote: For some parameters measured such as the mitochondrial membrane potential, it is better to consider the SD/Mean rather than the mean in the cell. For the ΔΨm, the signal compartmentalized in the mitochondria is what we want to measure. However, the distribution of the dye can change, switching from cytoplasm to mitochondria while the mean intensity remains constant. Hence, dividing the SD by the mean allows to follow a ratio that takes into consideration compartmentalization, which gives a reflection of the ΔΨm in the mitochondria when measuring fluorescence in whole cells (see Figure 3 at Duchen et al., 2003).6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nMeasure the intensity in the 640/690 channel for Annexin V (mean) (step 9).\nIdentify infected cells.\nDetect bacteria within the “real nuclei” population using the GFP signal in the 488/540 channel (step 10).\nCalculate morphological properties such as area in μm2 in order to follow the evolution of the vacuole size overtime (step 10).\nDiscriminate infected cells from non-infected cells (step 11).",
    "Note: In order to correctly monitor the bacterial replication, measuring the vacuole area in μm2 is preferable to counting the number of bacteria as single bacteria are more difficult to accurately segment once replication starts.\nSelect calculated outputs.\nSelect the desired calculated outputs depending on the experiment e.g., total number of cells (“real nuclei”), number of infected cells, number of spots per cell (bacteria), sum of spot area in μm2 per cell, intensity of TMRM per cell (mean, SD and SD/mean), intensity of Annexin-V per cell (mean).\nNote: The same analysis sequence can often be re-used with little adjustments for different experiments that have similar setups."
