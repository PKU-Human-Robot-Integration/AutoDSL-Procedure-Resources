    "Preparation of standardsStandards are prepared in 80% methanol by combining 0-20 μl of the racemic 20 μM 2HG working solution with 2 μl each of the 10 mM sodium lactate and 500 μM ISTD stocks into screw cap microcentrifuge tubes (Table 1). Lactate facilitates derivatization of the low concentration of 2HG found in the standards. Standards are vortexed and briefly centrifuged.Table 1. Preparation of 2HG standardsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160810/20160810193452_5090.jpg DerivatizationMetabolite extracts (200 μl) are transferred to 2 ml screw cap microcentrifuge tubes.Standards and biological samples are evaporated to dryness using a Speedvac roto-evaporator with drying rate set to “HIGH” (~65 °C oven temperature). Complete evaporation of all water is critically important as the derivatization reaction will not occur in the presence of water. Evaporation may also be performed under nitrogen gas (Note 2). Derivatization reagent is prepared by dissolving DATAN in acetonitrile:acetic acid (4:1, v/v) to 50 mg/ml. The esterification reaction requires an aprotic solvent. Acetonitrile is more polar than dimethyl chloride, and we found this solvent more capable of dissolving the dried residue. Additionally, acetonitrile was directly compatible with our chromatographic approach. Dried samples are treated with 50 μl DATAN solution and heated at 70 °C for 2 h in a temperature controlled heat block. The derivatized standard solutions change color from clear to clear-yellow, while samples change from clear to dark yellow-brown. We previously used derivatization times as short as 30 min, but have found that 2 h results in consistently complete derivatization. Samples are cooled to room temperature and spun briefly. Derivatized samples are diluted with 50 μl acetonitrile:acetic acid (4:1, v/v), vortexed, spun briefly, and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube for LC-MS analysis. Note: Diluting in acetonitrile:acetic acid was critically important for achieving adequate separation of the enantiomers chromatographically.",
    "Importantly, this method does not require an additional evaporation and resuspension step prior to LC-MS analysis as required by other published protocols.  Liquid chromatographySeparation is performed on a ZIC-HILIC stationary phase with guard column.Mobile phases are prepared from 200 mM formic acid in LC-MS grade water titrated to pH 3.25 with ammonium hydroxide, acetonitrile, and LC-MS grade water.The autosampler wash solution is 95% LC-MS grade acetonitrile in LC-MS grade water. Samples are injected at 5 μl using a 20 μl sample injection loop.Liquid chromatography is performed using a 15% buffer A and 85% buffer B isocratic elution of 30 min per sample.Mass spectrometryThe mass spectrometer is tuned using a standard solution of racemic 2HG to optimize ionization and ion optics. The mass spectrometer is operated in selective reaction monitoring mode, and the following mass transitions are monitored over the duration of the chromatographic run: 363 > 147 + 129 m/z (derivatized 2HG), 147 > 129 m/z (2HG), and 149 > 105 m/z (ISTD). We found the signal intensity for the 147 > 129 m/z transition was much greater than the 363 > 147 m/z transition and used the former for quantification of 2HG enantiomers. We confirmed that underivatized and derivatized 2HG peaks were well separated chromatographically, and confirmed the retention times of the derivatized samples using the 363 > 147 m/z transition in standard samples (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160810/20160810190415_2314.jpgFigure 2. Derivatization of 2HG standards. Standard solutions of D2HG (5 μM), L2HG (5 μM), and D2HG plus L2HG (5 μM each) were prepared at 5 μM in 200 μl of 80% methanol. These samples were evaporated, derivatized, and analyzed by LC-MS as described above.",
    "The 147 > 129 m/z extracted ion chromatogram of the racemic 2HG mixture (purple trace) demonstrated two well resolved peaks corresponding to the retention times observed for the derivatized D2HG sample (green trace) and the derivatized L2HG sample (blue trace). The green and blue traces are offset on the Y-axis by 5,000 intensity units for clarity. The 363 > 147 m/z extracted ion chromatogram (gray trace plotted on the right Y-axis) confirms these peaks represent derivatized 2HG. Underivatized 2HG elutes with a retention time of 6 min (not shown).Data analysisChromatographic peak areas for D2HG, L2HG, and the ISTD are integrated using Xcalibur software.Peak area ratios are calculated (D2HG/ISTD and L2HG/ISTD) for the standards to generate a standard curve (Figure 3).The sample concentration for each 2HG enantiomer is interpolated from the standard curve. Sample concentrations of 2HG should be normalized to some measure of sample mass (cell count, cell protein, tissue mass).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160810/20160810190805_9714.jpgFigure 3.
