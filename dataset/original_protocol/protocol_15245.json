  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were conducted in compliance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Loma Linda University.\n1. Presurgical Preparations\nAseptic techniques are recommended for all surgical procedures. Disinfect the stereotactic apparatus and prepare sterile surgical tools prior to surgery. Wear personal protective equipment (PPE) during all animal handling. Use a heating pad during surgery to maintain the animal's physiologic body temperature.\nWeigh the 8-12 week old mouse using a triple beam animal scale.\nCo-inject ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally then allow 7-10 min for the anesthesia to take effect (monitor for an adequate sedation).\nPlace the mouse onto a thermal blanket and shave the scalp.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to both eyes.\nSecure the airway, by gently moving the tongue laterally, and carefully secure the mouse's head onto the stereotactic apparatus. Note: The head must be secured horizontally to the basis of the stereotactic frame.\nDisinfect the surgical area with Betadine, and rinse with 70% ethanol. Repeat alternating applications of Betadine and 70% ethanol for a total of three times. Cotton-tipped applicators can be used for this purpose.\n2. Blood Injection Model\nMake a 1 cm long midline incision of the scalp with a #10 scalpel blade.\nUse cotton-tipped applicators to clear away the soft tissue covering the skull, in order to expose the perpendicular intersection point of the coronal and sagittal suture (bregma).\nMount the Hamilton syringe (250 μl) onto the injection pump, and stereotaxically direct the needle (26 Gauge) over bregma.\nNext, adjust the stereotactic manipulator arms to position the needle 0.2 mm anterior and 2 mm laterally to the right. At these coordinates make a small cranial burr hole, using a variable speed drill with a 1 mm drill bit.",
    "Suspend the animal's tail and disinfect its lower surface with 70% ethanol.\nPuncture the central tail artery with a sterile needle (e.g. 26 Gauge) and collect the arterial blood into an unheparinized capillary tube.\nTransfer the blood quickly from the capillary tube into the glass barrel of the Hamilton syringe, then insert the plunger.\nReattach the now 30 μl or more of arterial blood containing Hamilton syringe onto the injection pump and insert the needle (with its beveled edge facing the sagittal suture) through the burr hole just until its bevel is no longer visible.\nFrom this point advance the needle 3 mm ventrally and inject 5 μl of autologous blood at a rate of 2 μl/min.\nAfter completion of the first injection advance the needle 0.7 mm further in depth.\nWait for 5 min then inject 25 μl of blood into the right striatum.\nUpon completion of the second injection, leave the needle in position for additional 10 min, before withdrawing it at a rate of 1 mm/min.\nSeal the burr hole with bone wax and suture the skin.\nFor postoperative analgesia inject 0.05 mg/kg of buprenorphine subcutaneously in pre-warmed fluids (normal saline).\n3. Collagenase Injection Model\nFollowing the presurgical preparations, repeat steps 1-4 as described for the blood injection model.\nFill the Hamilton syringe (10 μl) with 0.075U of bacterial (clostridial) collagenase VII-S dissolved in 0.5 μl of saline. Avoid the formation of air bubbles.\nReattach the Hamilton syringe onto the injection pump and insert the needle (26 Gauge), through the burr hole just until its bevel is no longer visible.\nAdvance the needle 3.7 mm ventrally and inject the 0.075U of collagenase into the right striatum at a rate of 2 μl/min.",
    "Upon completion of the injection, leave the needle in position for additional 10 min, before withdrawing it at a rate of 1 mm/min.\nSeal the burr hole with bone wax and suture the skin.\nInject 0.05 mg/kg of buprenorphine subcutaneously in pre-warmed post-operative fluids.\n4. Sham Operation\nFollowing the presurgical preparations, repeat steps 1-4 as described for the blood injection model.\nInsert the needle (26 Gauge) 3.7 mm ventrally through the burr hole. The needle should remain in position for 10 min before being withdrawn at a rate of 1 mm/min.\nSeal the burr hole with bone wax and suture the skin.\nInject 0.05 mg/kg of buprenorphine subcutaneously in pre-warmed post-operative fluids.\n5. Representative Results",
    "Experimental intrastriatal hemorrhage evokes morphological as well as behavioral changes in rodents. These changes can be evaluated to ensure an adequate execution of the procedure, or to investigate the effects of potential treatments. Generating the bleed in a targeted brain area (e.g. basal ganglia) is most essential for a reproducible approach, and can be verified on gross or histologically stained brain sections (Figure 1-2). Injury to the basal ganglia results in sensorimotor deficits, which can be quantified via various behavioral assessments. Results of the corner turn test showed that, after experimental right-sided ICH, mice turned significantly more often ipsilaterally and away from the impaired contralateral (left) side, than sham operated animals at 24 and 72 hr after surgery (Figure 3 A). Furthermore, the ability to adequately place the impaired (left) forelimb on a surface, following vibrissae stimulation, was evaluated via the forelimb placing test. At 24 and 72 hr after surgery, mice subjected to right-sided ICH showed significantly fewer placements than sham operated animals. Measurement of brain edema is frequently employed to quantify the extent of brain injury after experimental ICH. Intracerebral injections of autologous blood (30 μl) or bacterial collagenase (0.075 U) led to a significant increase of brain water content in the ipsilateral cortex and basal ganglia at 24 (Figure 4 A) and 72 hr (Figure 4 B) after surgery (compared to sham). The outcome of the behavior tests (Figure 3) and the extent of brain edema (Figure 4) showed no difference between the blood and collagenase injection models at given volumes.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4289/4289fig1.jpg",
    "Figure 1. Modeling ICH in mice.  (A) The simplified schematic of a coronal brain section 0.2 mm anterior of bregma illustrates the proposed location of autologous blood or collagenase injection. The lateral ventricle is marked LV. CPu stands for caudate-putamen, a part of the striatum, and GP identifies the globus pallidus. Both, the striatum as well as the globus pallidus belong to a group of sub-cortical nuclei, also known as basal ganglia. (B) Representative photomicrograph of a coronal brain section 0.2mm anterior of bregma, obtained at 24 hr after intrastriatal injection of autologous whole blood.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/4289/4289fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Histological manifestation of the hematoma.

Intrastriatal injection of autologous blood (30 μl) or bacterial collagenase (0.075 U) caused reproducible neurofunctional deficits. (A) Mice after experimental ICH showed significantly more right turns than sham operated animals at 24 and 72 hr after surgery. (B) Forepaw placing capacity of the left limb was impaired after ICH at 24 and 72 hr after surgery. Values were expressed as mean±S.E.M. and analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks, followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls Method. A P value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant; n=6-12 per group, *P<0.05 compared to sham.
