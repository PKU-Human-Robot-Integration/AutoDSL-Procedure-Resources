    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of precursor molecules required for the introduction of the 124I radiolabel\nTwo epichaperome agents, PU-H71 and PU-AD (also called PU-HZ151) were discovered and translated to clinic as therapeutics for cancer and neurodegenerative diseases (Bolaender et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Inda et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Jhaveri et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Pillarsetty et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]; Rodina et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Sugita et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). Because the agents kinetically select for the epichaperomes over abundant chaperone pools, labeled derivatives of PU-H71 and PU-AD, can be used as epichaperome detection reagents (Bolaender et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). A favorable feature of these two epichaperome agents is the endogenous presence of iodine on their chemical structure. This naturally occurring stable isotope iodine-127 (127I) can be replaced with the positron emitter iodine-124 (124I) to provide a probe for use in epichaperome detection by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging or with iodine-131 (131I) for detection by autoradiography. These probes could be used to detect, track and quantify epichaperomes, and in turn PPI network dysfunction, at both cellular and organismal level, in either tissues or in live patients (Bolaender et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Inda et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Jhaveri et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Pillarsetty et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nA two-step synthesis was designed for radiolabeling of the epichaperome agents PU-AD and PU-H71. It entails converting the original molecule into the tin precursor (PU-H71-SnMe3 for PU-H71, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] and Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and PU-AD-SnMe3 for PU-AD, see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]), which is then radiolabeled using [124I]-NaI or [131I]-NaI (see Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and Tables 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] and 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]), to yield the epichaperome detection probes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1597-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "The steps below describe the first part of the protocol, which is to prepare, purify and characterize the tin precursor molecules.\nNote: All reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. PU-H71 and PU-AD, which we use below to prepare the tin precursors, were prepared as previously reported (Bolaender et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; He et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). Alternatively, both chemicals are available and can be purchased from several commercial suppliers.\nSynthesis of 9-(3-(isopropylamino)propyl)-8-((6-(trimethylstannyl)benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)thio)-9H-purin-6-amine (PU-H71-SnMe3) and of 9-(2-(Neopentylamino)ethyl)-8-((6-(trimethylstannyl)benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)thio)-9H-purin-6-amine (PU-AD-SnMe3)\nTiming: 2 h for each precursor\nThese steps describe how to prepare PU-H71-SnMe3 (See Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]) and PU-AD-SnMe3 (See Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Please refer to Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for the amounts of individual reagents to be added at each of the steps.\nWeigh PU-H71 (or PU-AD) and Tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) [Pd2(dba)3] in a 10 mL round-bottom flask containing a magnetic stirring bar. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nStopper the flask with a rubber septum. Insert through the septum a syringe attached to a nitrogen-filled balloon to replace the air in the reaction vessel with an inert atmosphere.\nCritical: It is important to carry out these reactions in the dark (eg. wrap the reaction vessel in aluminum foil) under an inert atmosphere and using dry solvents to obtain the maximum yield.\nMix the hexamethylditin in 3 mL of dry toluene and add this mixture through the septum using a syringe.\nPlace the reaction flask in an oil bath containing silicone oil kept on a hotplate stirrer and stir the reaction solution at 500 rpm for 2 h at 70°C.\nConcentrate the reaction mixture using a rotary evaporator and purify the resulting residue by preparatory thin layer chromatography (PTLC) as mentioned below:\nDissolve the residue in 0.5 mL of CH2Cl2:MeOH (1:1) and load it onto the PTLC as a uniform band.",
    "Develop the PTLC using a solvent mixture (mobile phase) composed of CH2Cl2:EtOAc:Hexane:NH3/MeOH (7N) at 2:1:2:0.5 (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for mobile phase recipe).\nScrap off the silica band containing the desired product (Rf∼0.45). The deiodinated byproduct band is observed at Rf∼0.33.\nDissolve the desired product in 50 mL of CH2Cl2:MeOH (10:1) and filter this suspension using a sintered glass funnel. Dry the filtrate under vacuum to afford the tin precursor molecules. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nCharacterize each product by NMR spectroscopy (1H NMR and 13C NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) (see the expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] section).\nNote: PU-H71 and PU-AD contain a secondary alkyl amine which could theoretically interfere during the synthesis of the corresponding trimethylstannyl derivative using palladium (0) catalyst resulting in unwanted side reactions. Former synthetic protocols, employing tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)Pd(0) as a catalyst, used Boc to protect the free amino group (Taldone et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). In the current protocol we use tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) as catalyst and have confirmed using LC-MS that the secondary alkyl amine is tolerant to this synthetic protocol and does not need Boc protection.",
    "Note: Using 25 mg of PU-H71 and 10 mg of PU-AD as the starting materials, yields approximately 19 mg of PU-H71-SnMe3 and 6.8 mg PU-AD-SnMe3, respectively (∼70% and 64% yield, respectively). The synthesis has been repeated at least three times, and the yield of the reaction has been stable. A 2.5 mg stock of PU-H71-SnMe3 (or 2 mg PU-AD-SnMe3) is sufficient for 100 labeling reactions. This amount of product can be aliquoted for individual reactions after dissolving it first in 1 mL of methylene chloride:methanol 1:1 v/v and then transferring 10 μL aliquots into brown Eppendorf tubes. Upon drying under vacuum in the Genevac for 2–3 h, the vials are then stored at −20°C. The remaining product can be stored at −20°C as solid powder in an aluminum wrapped glass vial.\nNote: It is recommended to check precursor stability every 6 months by reconstituting the content of 1 vial in 20 μL of methylene chloride:methanol 1:1 v/v and applying the mix onto a LC-MS instrument.\nPause point: The products can be stored at −20°C for at least a year.\nSynthesis of the radiolabeled probes\nTiming: 30 min\nThe steps below describe the second part of the protocol, which is to prepare, purify and characterize the radiolabeled epichaperome probes, specifically [124I]-PU-H71 (See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] and Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3]) or [131I]-PU-H71. Similar steps can be used to prepare [124/131I]-PU-AD (See Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] and Table 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl4]).\nNote: The following steps use and yield radioactive compounds, and therefore, require special laboratories and permission to handle radioactivity.\nCritical: Radioactive iodine isotopes (iodine-124, iodine-131) that we use for radiolabeling emit high energy gamma rays and are considered potent radiation sources. Appropriate training of personnel and the use of proper facilities are required to handle radioactive substances. Regular monitoring of workers exposure, including thyroid monitoring, is necessary.",
    "Critical: This protocol requires the handling of radioactive materials and therefore needs radiation safety and appropriate biosafety approvals according to institutional guidelines.\nPipette 20 μL of ethanol into the brown Eppendorf tube containing 25 μg of PU-H71-SnMe3 precursor.\nPipette ≤100 μL of 124I-Sodium Iodide solution (0.5–20 mCi) into the vial.\nPipette 5 μL of chloramine-T solution (2 mg/mL in acetic acid) into the vial and allow the reaction mixture to incubate for 5 min at 24 ± 2°C.\nNote: After the addition of the above reagents, it is recommended to centrifuge the samples in a minifuge (approximately 12 × g) for 15 s. This is to ensure that all the reagents are at the bottom of the Eppendorf, and thus able to react. This is to minimize deposition of the reagents on the sides of the Eppendorf which can lead to low/no yields.\nNote: The reaction should be shielded from light. Performing the reaction in the brown Eppendorf tube is typically sufficient for this purpose.\nAssay the amount of activity in the reaction vial by placing in the dose calibrator chamber. Select iodine-124 as the radionuclide in the isotope selector. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nNote: The dose measurement is sensitive to placement of the reaction vial within the chamber. Please ensure that the measurement vial is suspended from the plastic dipper to be placed near the center of the chamber. Capintec recommends using a calibration setting number of 570 for 124I on the CRC-15R dose calibrator.\nPre-condition the C18 cartridge with 10 mL of ethanol followed by 10 mL water. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nDraw 10 mL of water into a syringe. Eject 1 mL of the water from the syringe into the reaction mixture, then draw the water/reaction mixture back into the same syringe.",
    "Load the reaction mixture onto the preconditioned C18 cartridge and elute the leftover radioactive iodine with water. Discard the water fraction as waste.\nNote: The water fraction will contain some amount of radioactivity. Ensure that the water fraction is stored as radioactive waste and can be disposed as non-radioactive waste only after complete decay.\nRinse the C18 cartridge with an additional 10 mL of water and discard the eluted water as waste.\nNote: See note above.\nUse ≤3 mL of ethanol to elute the product from the C18 Sep-Pak into individual Eppendorf tubes. Record the eluted activity and time.\nNote: To minimize ethanol content, it is recommended that users elute the compound in 0.3 mL fractions and combine fractions with highest activities.\nWorking at a temperature ≤45°C, use inert gas flow to reduce the ethanol volume to approximately 0.1–0.3 mL. Record the reduced ethanol volume.\nNote: The inert gas flow should be highly regulated at a flow rate of <100 mL/min to minimize creating vortexes that can lead to spilling of the evaporating liquid to the sides or out of the vial leading to loss of radioactivity. Complete drying of solvent is not recommended because redissolving will require high volumes.\nFormulate the reaction mixture in 1–10 mL of saline and pass through a 0.2 μm sterile filter into the final product vial.\nRecord the final product information.\nRemove 0.05 mL of the final product using sterile and pyrogen free pipettes or tuberculin syringe for QC test (see below steps 20–24).\nQuality control of the radiolabeled epichaperome probes\nTiming: 60 min\nThe steps below describe the method employed for the analysis and characterization of [124I]-PU-H71. Similar steps can be performed for [124I]-PU-AD or the I-131 labeled probes.",
    "Because the mass of radiopharmaceutical being synthesized is in the sub nanogram range, traditional analytical methods such as NMR or mass spectrometry cannot be used. Therefore, the most common way to ascertain the identity of the radiolabeled probe is using HPLC wherein the retention time of the radioactive sample is matched with the retention time of non-radioactive (cold) standard (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). The radioactive HPLC chromatogram can be used to evaluate the % purity of the sample by integrating the area under the curve of desired compound and of observed impurities. If the compound is administered to animals or humans, it needs to be formulated in a saline and/or buffered solution with minimal amounts of excipients. Ethanol is commonly used as an excipient to increase solubility, but its concentration should be lower than <5% v/v in saline or buffer. Usually, gas chromatography is employed to determine residual solvent content. The injectable should be clear and particle free upon visual inspection (Table 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1597-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

CPM, counts per minute.\n(B) Same as (A) for PU-H71 and [124I]-PU-H71.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1597_8.csv\nPrepare the blank solution by adding 0.6 mL of ethanol to a 10 mL vial of saline.\nPU-H71 analytical run is done using isocratic condition (28% acetonitrile/ 72% water with added 0.1% TFA, see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] for mobile phase recipe) and running the samples in the following sequence:\nBlank, 20 μL.\nReference Standard Solution, 20 μL.\nBlank, 20 μL.\n[124I]-PU-H71, 20 μL.",
    "The radiochemical identity of the compound is confirmed by matching its retention time with that of the cold standard.\nNote: Instead of sequential runs, both cold standard and radioactive standard can be co-injected to confirm the identical retention time.\nThe radiochemical purity of the radioactive product is calculated by integrating the areas under the curve (in the radioactivity channel) of radioactive compound and the rest of the peaks.\nTake 2 μL of the final formulation and drop it onto a pH paper to measure the pH. The pH should be between 5.5 and 8.0 for the radiopharmaceutical.\nNote: Ideally the pH should be near 7.4, but depending on the nature of the compound, the injectate can be buffered within a pre-defined acceptable range to improve solubility. This also minimizes residualization of radioactivity on the syringe used for injections.\nIn vitro blocking experiment to validate the specificity of the radiolabeled probe\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis section describes the steps performed to validate the specific binding of the [124I]-PU-AD probe. Similar steps can be used for the other radiolabeled epichaperome probes.\nNote: This experiment uses radioactive compounds, and therefore, requires special facilities and the permission to handle radioactivity.\nCritical: Radioactive iodine isotopes (iodine-124) emit high energy gamma rays and are considered potent radiation sources. Appropriate training of personnel and the use of proper facilities are required to handle radioactive substances. Regular monitoring of workers exposure, including thyroid monitoring, is necessary.\nCritical: This protocol requires the handling of radioactive particles and therefore needs biosafety approval according to institutional guidelines.",
    "Steps 8–10 in ‘before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]’ section described the process of plating cells. Use the trypan blue dye exclusion-based method to count viable cells and to calculate the number of cells needed to seed in 6-well plates for each condition in a final volume of 2 mL per well. Typically, 0.5 × 106 of MDA-MB-468 cells per well are optimal for this experiment to get the cells at 70% confluence the next day.\nNote: Some cell lines may require higher or lower cell numbers depending on the experimental conditions.\nCritical: To minimize variation and ensure even distribution between wells, add the calculated number of required cells in a single 50 mL Falcon tube first and then distribute to the respective wells.\nTreat the cells with Vehicle, 1 μM of PU-AD and 1 μM of PU-H71 in triplicates.\nNote: Use a 10 mM stock solution of PU-H71 or PU-AD in DMSO. To obtain the 1 μM final concentration, add 2 μL of the stock solution to each well containing 2 mL of media.\nAdd 18.5–37 kBq (0.5–1 μCi) of [124I]-PU-AD per well and incubate for 1 h at 37°C.\nAdd the same amount of sample in separate Eppendorf tubes to serve as controls for the added total activity. This sample will be used for counting in the gamma counter.\nFrom the 6 well plates, carefully aspirate the media from the wells and wash cells three times with the cold 1× PBS to remove unbound radioactivity.\nDetach the cells using 0.25% trypsin for 5 min and collect them into Eppendorf tubes.\nUse a gamma counter to measure the radioactivity associated with each experimental condition. Record the raw values in CPM (counts per minute) for each sample. Measure the radioactivity in controls (step 26).",
    "To obtain % uptake (normalized to each experimental condition), divide the CPM values from each sample to CPM values from the control and multiply by 100 (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). In general, we present the data as % uptake/million cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1597-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Representative bar graph indicating the percentage uptake of the radiolabeled PU-AD\nGraphed is the specific uptake in MDA-MB-468 cells after 1 h of concurrent treatment of cells with Vehicle (DMSO), PU-AD or PU-H71 (1 μM) and a tracer amount of radiolabeled PU-AD (1 μCi, approximately 1 pmole). Graph, mean±SD, n = 3 replicates.\nNote: The number of cells in each well is determined prior to plating (see step 25). Alternatively, cells can be plated in control wells (in triplicate) and counted on the day of the radioactivity measurements to determine the average cell number per well.\nPET imaging in mice\nThis section describes the steps to inject the radiolabeled epichaperome probe, to acquire data through non-invasive positron emission tomography imaging and to process the acquired data. It provides an example in the use of the probes for detecting and profiling epichaperome-positive tissues in vivo and demonstrates the specificity of the probe for epichaperomes in the context of a whole organism (e.g., mouse).\nNote: All animal experiments must follow the Institutional Animal Care policies and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines under an approved protocol.\nPET scanning\nTiming: 1 h – 72 h (depending on how many imaging time-points are planned)\nTail vein injections: 2–5 min per animal.\nAnesthesia: 5 min per animal.\nImaging time: Depends on the scanning time, approximately 10 min at early time points and up to 30 min at later time points.",
    "Steps 11–15 in ‘before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin]’ section described the process of tumor implantation. We suggest performing the PET imaging experiment when the size of the tumors reaches 250–400 mm3. For this experiment female athymic nude mice bearing single or bilateral tumor xenografts on forelimbs were used. The iodine-124 has a long life (t1/2 = 4.2 days), which permits the study of the drug kinetics non-invasively for a prolonged time.\nCritical: Make sure the mouse cages are clearly labeled with radioactive cage cards.\nCritical: Starting 48 h prior to tracer administration, add 0.01% potassium iodide solution to the drinking water to minimize the thyroid uptake of free iodide arising from metabolism of I-124 labeled probe.\nUsing a 1.0 mL insulin syringe, inject intravenously via the tail vein, 5.55–9.25 MBq (150–250 mCi) of [124I]-PU-H71 or [124I]-PU-AD formulated in 200 μL of 5% ethanol in saline. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nNote: Place the mouse under a heat lamp for 2–4 min and rub the area with an alcohol swab to induce vasodilation for intravenous administration. If necessary, to confirm placement of needle in the tail vein, pull the syringe’s plunger outward to observe the blood flow.\nNote: Syringe withdrawal from the tail vein can lead to minor bleeding. If necessary, using a sterile alcohol wipe, apply mild pressure at the injection site for 5–15 s to control the bleeding. Ensure that the tail is wiped clean after the injection using the sterile alcohol wipe. If tail markings are used for mouse identification, then remark them as necessary.\nAt designated time points post probe administration, place the animal in an induction chamber for anesthesia using 2% isoflurane in oxygen at a flow rate of 2 L/min.\nNote: Anesthesia takes about 5 min to be effective so consider scheduling your experiments accordingly.\nPrepare the PET scanner.",
    "Create a new file in the MicroPET 2.0. program with appropriate acquisition time parameters (10 min for early time points and 20 min for time points after 16 h).\nInput the necessary information regarding the mouse and the administered radioactive dose, including the physical half-life of 124I, the remaining activity in the used syringe, and the time-point of the measurement.\nPlace the animal in the scanner to be at the center of the field of view of the PET scanner.\nPlace the mouse in a prone and headfirst position.\nMaintain the animal under 2% isoflurane anesthesia in oxygen at a flow rate of 2 L/min during the entire scanning period.\nInitiate a 30 min PET scan.\nObtain list-mode data (10–30 min acquisitions) for each animal at various time points to obtain a minimum of 5 million coincident counts. Troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.11].\nNote: Use an energy window of 420–580 keV and a coincidence timing window of 6 ns.\nTake the mouse out of the scanner when the acquisition is finished and move it back to the mouse cage displaying a radioactive cage card. Mice administered a radioactive compound must be housed separately from other mice. The bedding, cage, food, water, waste is considered as radioactive waste and should be disposed accordingly.\nAnalyzing data from PET imaging\nTiming: 2 h (varies depending on the number of animals)\nSort the resulting list-mode data into 2-dimensional histograms by Fourier rebinding and reconstruct transverse images by filtered back projection (FBP).\nCorrect the image data for dead-time count losses and physical decay to the time of injection (no correction applied for attenuation, scatter, or partial-volume averaging).\nNote: The measured reconstructed spatial resolution of the Focus 120 is 1.6-mm FWHM at the center of the field of view.",
    "Note: The transmission scan is performed for clinical PET/CT to correct for attenuation, which can be significant for humans. For mice no such corrections are applied.\nOpen the corresponding data file using the ASIPro VMTM (Siemens Medical Solutions, USA), or other software. Perform ROI analysis of the reconstructed images using ASIPro VMTM (Siemens Medical Solutions, USA), and record the maximum pixel value for each tissue/organ ROI.\nReconstructed microPET images, including 124I images, are initially parameterized in terms of count rate (cps/voxel). These images are then quantitated, that is, parameterized in terms of activity concentration (μCi 124I/mL) using a system calibration factor (i.e., μCi/mL/cps/voxel), derived from reconstructed images of a mouse-sized water-filled cylinder containing a known concentration (μCi /mL) of 18F. The 18F calibration factor is converted to the 124I calibration factor by adjusting for the difference in positron branching ratio between 18F (0.967) and 124I (0.228) to convert the 124I count rates per voxel to activity concentrations.\nNormalize the resulting image data to the administered activity to parameterize the microPET images in terms of %ID/g (corrected for decay of 124I to the time of injection).\nPost-reconstruction smoothing can be applied to improve the quality of images. Smoothened images/frames should not be used for obtaining parametric data (%ID/g). Troubleshooting 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.13].\nNote: When analyzing data from PET imaging, %ID/g values are more commonly used for mice and other small animal studies, whereas for humans, the standardized uptake value (SUV) is preferred. The standardized uptake value (SUV) can be calculated using the formula:\n  S U V =   %   I D  g  ∗ w e i g h t  o f  m o u s e   100 %",
