    "Construction of vectors and Arabidopsis transformationTo deliver a protein of interest to the chloroplast IEM, we have to fuse at least two distinct targeting signals to it. One signal is the transit peptide, and the other is the chloroplast IEM targeting signal (Figure 3). The transit peptide has been known to serve as the targeting signal to the chloroplast stroma and found in the majority of precursor proteins targeted to the chloroplast interior. However, the transit peptide seems to be insufficient to target cargo proteins, in our case the cyanobacterial bicarbonate transporters, to the chloroplast IEM. As an additional IEM targeting signal, we fused the mature portion of the Cor413im1 protein to the chimeric construct shown in Figure 3. This portion can function as the IEM targeting signal in transgenic Arabidopsis (Uehara et al., 2016). Another study has shown that a membrane protein leader can serve as the IEM targeting signal in a transient expression system (Rolland et al., 2016). In addition, it is necessary to add a tag to detect chimeric proteins if specific antibodies are unavailable. The length of the transit peptide and the mature portion of Cor413im1 shown in Figure 3 has been already described in detail elsewhere (Okawa et al., 2008 and 2014).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180201/20180201025345_0696.jpgFigure 3. Construct design for the specific targeting of bicarbonate transporter SbtA II to the chloroplast IEM. Schematic diagram of the chimeric SbtAII construct used in this study. TP indicates transit peptide and serves as the targeting signal to chloroplasts. The Cor413im1 portion of the construct was derived from the mature portion of Cor413im1 and can function as the targeting signal to the chloroplast IEM. The protein A domain of the fusion construct contains two IgG-binding domains from Staphylococcal protein A and serves as the tag for detection of the chimeric protein.",
    "Arabidopsis chloroplast isolationWe developed a method to isolate sufficient amounts of intact chloroplasts using a smaller number of plants based on the method described in Smith et al. (2002). This method is useful if large numbers of seeds cannot be obtained for the isolation of chloroplasts (e.g., mutants, transgenic lines). Throughout the procedure, samples should be kept on ice unless stated otherwise, and buffers should be chilled prior to experiments.Sow sterilized seeds on 0.5x MS plates (100 seeds per plate, four plates per isolation, see Recipes) supplemented with 1% sucrose. Allow Arabidopsis plants to grow in growth chambers under a 16 h-light/8 h-dark cycle, 100 μE m-2 sec-1, 22 °C for 14-18 d (Figure 4A). Harvest the entire aerial portions of the plants with a razor blade, and place immediately in a 90 mm diameter Petri dish containing 10 ml digestion buffer (see Recipes) on ice. Plants harvested from two plates should be placed into one enzyme digestion reaction so that you need to prepare two 90 mm diameter Petri dishes for four Arabidopsis plates. When all tissue has been harvested, chop the tissue rapidly using a razor blade for up to 1 min (Figure 4B).Note: Do not chop for more than 1 min or smash the tissues. Remove the digestion buffer from the Petri dish. Add 13.5 ml digestion enzyme solution (see Recipes) to the Petri dish, and distribute the tissue uniformly with the fingertips (Figure 4C). Place the Petri dishes into a plastic container, and incubate in a growth chamber for 3 h at 22 °C (light intensity at around 50-100 μE m-2 sec-1).During digestion, prepare a 40% (20 ml, upper layer):85% (7 ml, lower layer) AT Percoll (see Recipes) step gradient in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and maintain on ice.",
    "We use one gradient for two Arabidopsis plates (one enzyme digestion) so that we usually prepare two gradients for one isolation. You may also use smaller Percoll volumes and tubes (Smith et al., 2002). Harvest the protoplasts through gentle swirling (or gentle agitation) of the plate for 30-60 sec, then filter the medium through a 200 μm mesh cone, placed inside a small funnel, into a 50 ml centrifuge tube on ice. Collect protoplasts from one Petri dish into one 50 ml tube that you need to prepare two tubes. Transfer any tissue from the nylon mesh back into the Petri dish and wash the tissue with 10 ml of ice-cold fresh digestion buffer. Filter the tissue-buffer mixture into the same 50 ml centrifuge tube. Wash the tissue one or two times more to ensure that as many protoplasts are released as possible (Figure 4D). Centrifuge the protoplasts for 5 min at 100 x g, 4 °C (Figure 4E). Remove and discard the supernatant carefully with an aspirator. Be careful not to disturb the protoplast pellet, as it is very loose. Resuspend the pellet in 5 ml protoplast resuspension buffer (see Recipes) by gently swirling the pellet while the buffer is dispensed down the side of the tube. After the protoplasts are resuspended, add another 5 ml protoplast resuspension buffer and gently mix (Figure 4F). Centrifuge the protoplasts for 4 min at 100 x g, 4 °C (Figure 4G). Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 5 ml protoplast breakage buffer (see Recipes). After the protoplasts are resuspended, add another 5 ml protoplast breakage buffer and gently mix (Figure 4H). Immediately transfer the resuspended protoplast pellet into the barrel of the protoplast-rupturing device.",
    "Holding the end of the device over a 50 ml centrifuge tube on ice, carefully replace the plunger, and gently and firmly force the suspension through the layers of mesh (Figure 4I). Repeat this procedure once. Quickly and carefully layer the 10 ml broken protoplasts onto the AT Percoll step gradient (Figure 4J). Centrifuge in a swinging-bucket rotor for 10 min at 2,500 x g, 4 °C, with the brake off (Figure 4K). Following centrifugation, there should be two visible green bands in the gradient: an upper band of broken chloroplasts at the protoplast breakage buffer/40% Percoll interface, and a lower band of intact chloroplasts at 40%/85% Percoll interface. Remove the load zone and the upper band of broken chloroplasts by aspiration. Harvest the lower band using a Pasteur pipet, and dilute the intact chloroplasts with 40-45 ml HEPES-sorbitol buffer (see Recipes), pH 8.0, in a 50 ml centrifuge tube (Figure 4L). Intact chloroplasts from the two AT Percoll gradients should be combined into one tube. Centrifuge the diluted intact chloroplasts for 5 min at 700 x g, 4 °C (Figure 4M). Carefully decant the supernatant, and discard all excess buffer without disrupting the pellet. Resuspend the pellet in a small volume (200-300 μl) of HEPES-sorbitol buffer, pH 8.0 (Figure 4N).Dilute 5 μl of the chloroplast resuspension into 995 μl 80% acetone. Mix vigorously and microcentrifuge at ~15,000 x g for 2 min to remove the protein precipitate. Measure the A652 of the supernatant against an 80% acetone blank. Calculate the chlorophyll concentration (mg/ml) by using the following equation (Smith et al., 2002):(A652/36) x 200 to compensate for the dilution factor. Adjust the chlorophyll concentration to 1 mg chlorophyll/ml using HEPES-sorbitol buffer.",
    "The prepared chloroplasts should be used immediately for Procedures C and D, while chloroplasts for procedure E can be stored at -80 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180201/20180201025754_6819.jpgFigure 4. Overview of Arabidopsis chloroplasts isolation (Procedure B)Fractionation of chloroplastsCentrifuge 0.5 ml of 1 mg chlorophyll/ml chloroplasts prepared in Step B11 for 5 min at 700 x g, 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and measure the volume of supernatant by pipetting. Resuspend the chloroplast pellet in TE/DTT buffer (see Recipes) containing 0.6 M sucrose to a concentration of 1 mg/ml chlorophyll (Figure 5A). Let stand for 10 min on ice. Freeze the chloroplast suspension for 1-2 h at -20 °C. If you do not proceed to the fractionation stage immediately, it is possible to keep the frozen chloroplast suspension at -80 °C until use. Thaw the suspension and dilute with 3 volumes of TE/DTT buffer. To collect the total chloroplast proteins, take 5 μl of chloroplast suspension into 1.5 ml microtubes before the addition of TE/DTT. Homogenize with 20 strokes in a Dounce (or Potter) homogenizer with a tight pestle (Figure 5B). Transfer the suspension into 3.5 ml polycarbonate ultracentrifuge tubes. Ultracentrifuge the lysed chloroplasts in a fixed angle rotor for 1 h at 40,000 x g, 4 °C (Figure 5C). Remove the brownish supernatant containing the stromal content using a pipette and store at -80 °C (Figure 5D). Resuspend the membrane pellet in TE/DTT buffer containing 0.2 M sucrose to a concentration of 1 mg chlorophyll/ml by pipetting (Figure 5D) and homogenization (Figure 5E, 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer). Set up a sucrose step gradient consisting of 1 ml of 1 M sucrose, and 0.7 ml of 0.46 M sucrose in 2.2 ml polyallomer tubes. Layer the membrane suspension (0.2 M sucrose) onto the top (Figure 5F and Figure 6A). Apply 0.",
    "5 ml of membrane suspension on each gradient. Ultracentrifuge the samples for 1.5 h at 270,000 x g, 4 °C, in a swinging-bucket rotor using low acceleration and deceleration rates (Figure 5G). Collect the interface from each step of the gradient (Figure 5H and Figure 6B). The upper interface (0.2:0.46 M sucrose) contains residual stroma and plastoglobules. The middle interface (0.46:1 M sucrose) is highly enriched in envelope membranes. The thylakoid membranes form a tight pellet at the bottom of the tube. Precipitate the stromal proteins (collected in Step C2) by adding 100% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) to give a final concentration of 10% and tRNA to give a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Incubate for 60 min or longer on ice. Collect the TCA precipitate by centrifugation for 30 min at ~20,000 x g, 4 °C. Wash the pellet with 1 ml of 80% acetone and centrifuge for 15 min at ~20,000 x g, 4 °C. Resuspend the pellet directly in 200 μl SDS-sample buffer (see Recipes). Precipitate the total chloroplast proteins (5 μl collected in Step C2) by adding 1 ml of 80% acetone and vortex. Keep the tube on ice for 30 min and centrifuge for 30 min at ~20,000 x g, 4 °C. Resuspend the pellet directly in 50 μl SDS-sample buffer.To collect the envelope membranes, dilute the 0.46:1 M sucrose interface fraction with 3 to 5 volumes of TE/DTT buffer and centrifuge in a fixed angle rotor for 1 h at 270,000 x g, 4 °C (Figure 5J). Remove the supernatant with a pipette and discard. Resuspend the pellets in 30 μl of SDS-sample buffer for analysis (Figure 5K). Thylakoid pellets are suspended in 0.3 ml SDS-sample buffer (Figure 5H).",
    "After the quantification of proteins in each fraction, analyze total chloroplast (3 μg), stroma (3 μg), envelope (1 μg), and thylakoid (1.5 μg) fractions by SDS-PAGE.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180204/20180204195353_1095.jpgFigure 5. Overview of chloroplastfractionation (Procedure C)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180204/20180204194508_9402.jpgFigure 6. Schematic drawings of sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation for the separation of envelope and thylakoid membrane (Step C4). This experiment uses 2.2 ml Ultra-ClearTM centrifuge tubes. A and B represent sucrose density gradients before and after ultracentrifugation, respectively.Trypsin treatment of intact chloroplastsTrypsin is capable of permeating the outer envelope membrane (OEM) but not the inner envelope membrane (IEM) of intact chloroplasts (Jackson et al., 1998; Inaba et al., 2003). Therefore, proteins localized to the OEM, such as Toc75, are sensitive to trypsin treatment. This method allows us to determine whether a protein of interest localizes to the OEM or IEM of chloroplasts.Dilute 25 μl of 1 mg chlorophyll/ml intact chloroplasts (Step B11) with 125 μl of HEPES-sorbitol buffer. Add 150 μl of 2x trypsin buffer (see Recipes), mix gently, and incubate for 30-40 min on ice. Stop the reaction by adding 300 μl of 2x stop buffer (see Recipes). Mix very carefully by inverting the tube several times and incubate on ice for 10 min. After incubation on ice, isolate the chloroplasts by centrifugation through a 1x 40% Percoll (see Recipes) for 5 min at 2,500 x g, 4 °C.Carefully aspirate the supernatant and 1x 40% Percoll, containing some broken chloroplasts. Resuspend the chloroplast pellet in 500 μl of 1x HEPES-sorbitol buffer (see Recipes). Centrifuge the chloroplasts for 2 min at 2,500 x g, 4 °C. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 50 μl of SDS-cOmpleteTM buffer (see Recipes).Alkaline extraction of chloroplastsTo investigate whether a protein of interest is integrated into the envelope membranes, chloroplasts can be subjected to alkaline extraction.",
    "If the protein is integrated into the envelope membranes, it should be recovered in the pellet fraction after alkaline extraction and subsequent ultracentrifugation. Peripherally associated IEM proteins, such as Tic22, are released from the IEM during the extraction (Kouranov et al., 1998).Dilute 25 μl of 1 mg chlorophyll/ml chloroplasts (Step B11) into 1 ml of 0.2 M Na2CO3, pH 12, in a 1.5 ml polyallomer tube and incubate for 10 min on ice.Ultracentrifuge the mixture in a fixed angle rotor for 15 min at 100,000 x g, 4 °C. Carefully collect the supernatant containing the stroma and transfer to a fresh tube. Resuspend the membrane pellet in 80 μl SDS-sample buffer. Dissolve the pellet completely. Precipitate the alkaline supernatant by adding 100% (w/v) TCA to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) and tRNA to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Incubate for 30 to 60 min on ice. Collect the TCA precipitate by centrifuging for 30 min at ~20,000 x g, 4 °C. Wash the pellet with 1 ml of 80% acetone and centrifuge for 15 min at ~20,000 x g, 4 °C. Resuspend the pellet directly in 80 μl SDS-sample buffer. Dissolve the pellet completely.Dot blot assay for estimation of protein concentrationsEstimation of concentrations of samples from Procedures C and D are performed as follows:Cut a square of WhatmanTM 3MM Chromatography paper (3MM paper) and place it on a clean sheet of paper towel. Mark the concentration of BSA standards and each sample to be tested on 3MM paper with a pencil (see Figure 7).Dilute the 2.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) with SDS-sample buffer to make BSA standards (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.5 mg/ml). Dilute 3 μl of each sample to be tested with 3 μl SDS-sample buffer.",
    "If the protein concentration is expected to be high, make a serial dilution as shown in Figure 7.Gently dot 2 μl of the BSA standards and each sample onto the 3MM paper with a pipette. Dry the 3MM paper at room temperature for at least 20 min. Stain on a shaker with Coomassie Blue stain for 30 min.Collect Coomassie Blue stain as much as possible (reusable).Destain the paper on a shaker with Coomassie destain solution. Change the destain solution every 20 min. Destain until the background is clear. Dry the 3MM paper on a paper towel.Estimate the concentration of each sample by comparing the intensity of the blot color to the BSA standards."
