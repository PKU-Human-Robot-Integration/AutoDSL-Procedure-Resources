    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nProcess PDOs to single cells\nTiming: ∼30 min\nOrganoid size and growth rate can vary greatly between different patient derived cultures. Therefore, the culture size and density prior to processing is dependent on the growth dynamics of the individual PDO model. For examples of PDOs that are ready for processing, see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1492-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Example of PDOs that are ready for processing\n(A) Low magnification image of PDOs in culture, showing numerous organoids at different depths (at the focal plane and below) in the Matrigel dome, illustrating the 3D culture environment and providing an example of confluency and organoid size (Scale bar 400 μm).\n(B) Examples of different PDOs that are ready for processing (Scale bar 200 μm).

    "Note: Adjust the volume of TrypLE Express depending on the number of wells added to the 15 mL Falcon tube.\nNote: Some PDOs may require longer incubation times to achieve single cell suspensions. In such cases 100 μg/mL DNase I may be added to TrypLE Express to prevent cell clumping, caused by the release of “sticky” DNA molecules from dying cells. However, DNase I should not be used prior to downstream processes involving DNA or RNA extraction.\nAdd 2 mL of Basic PDO Culture Medium to stop the effect of TrypLE Express and centrifuge at 300×g for 3 min.\nCarefully remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 1 mL Basic PDO Culture Media.\nLabel single cells with PKH26 dye\nTiming: ∼ 1 h\nThe following protocol has been optimized for PKH26 labeling of CRC PDOs and uses a final concentration of 2 × 10-6 M of PKH26 and 1 × 107 cells per mL suspended in a final volume of 2 mL. This method may also be used for in vitro and ex vivo labeling of other cell types from a wide variety of systems. PKH26 fluorescence is extremely stable and compatible for downstream use with green, violet, red, or far-red viability probes, DNA dyes, fluorescent proteins, and antibodies. For further details on PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker Kits for General Cell Membrane Labeling see manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/deepweb/assets/sigmaaldrich/product/documents/271/475/mini26bul.pdf[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/deepweb/assets/sigmaaldrich/product/documents/271/475/mini26bul.pdf])\nCritical: Over-labeling of cells will cause loss of membrane integrity and reduced cell recovery. It is therefore essential that the amount of lipophilic PKH26 dye incorporated into cell membranes be limited.\nDilute 10 μL of cell suspension with 10 μL of trypan blue and place 10 μL into a hemocytometer to count live cells.",
    "Prepare a 2 × 107 per mL single cell suspension in Basic PDO Culture Media in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and centrifuge at 300×g for 3 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant with a micropipette leaving no more than 25 μL of supernatant in the tube.\nResuspend cells in 1 mL of Diluent C (provided with the PKH26 Red Fluorescent Cell Linker Kit) with gentle trituration with a P1000 tip to ensure complete dispersion of cells.\nCritical: Do not disperse cells in Diluent C by vortexing and do not keep cells in Diluent C for extended periods, i.e., no more than 5–10 min, including incubation time in step 14 below.\nAdd 4 μL of PKH26 dye to 1 mL of Diluent C in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube and mix well.\nCritical: Prepare the dye solution in Diluent C immediately prior to staining.\nImmediately after preparation of the PKH26 dye solution, add the 1 mL Diluent C cell suspension to the 1 mL dye solution and instantly triturate with a P1000 tip.\nCritical: Staining is instantaneous. Therefore, for uniform and reproducible cell labeling ensure rapid and uniform dispersion of cells in dye solution.\nIncubate cell-dye suspension for 2–3 min and triturate with a P1000 tip every 30 s.\nStop the staining by adding the cell-dye solution to a 15 mL Falcon tube containing 8 mL of 10% FCS DMEM/F12 and incubate at room temperature (20°C–22°C) for 1 min.\nCentrifuge at 400×g for 5 min, carefully remove supernatant, resuspend in 10 mL of Basic PDO Culture Media and transfer to a fresh 15 mL Falcon tube.\nCentrifuge at 300×g for 5 min, remove supernatant and wash cells in 10 mL Basic PDO Culture Media. Repeat two more times to ensure removal of unbound dye.",
    "Note: Successfully PKH26 labeled cell pellets will appear visibly pink.\nOptional: For flow cytometric evaluation of PKH26 labeling and cell viability, prior to the final wash step remove 500 μL of the cell suspension, transfer to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and centrifuge at 300×g for 3 min. Resuspend cells in 500 μL Basic PDO Culture Media containing a 1:10,000 DAPI dilution, pass through a 70 μm cell strainer into FACS tubes, place on ice (for up to 3 h) and proceed with flow cytometric analysis.\nCentrifuge at 300×g for 3 min and place the 15 mL Falcon containing the stained cell pellet on ice.\nResuspend cells on ice in the appropriate volume of Matrigel, i.e., 120 μL Matrigel per well of a 6-well plate.\nNote: The volume of Matrigel used for resuspension and the number of wells used for plating is dependent on the number of cells isolated and their growth dynamics as organoids in Matrigel. Organoid proliferation rates and sizes can vary greatly between patient models and so the number of cells resuspended per Matrigel dome should be individually determined based on the previously observed growth dynamics of each PDO model.\nRemove pre-warmed 6-well plates from the incubator and add 120 μL of Matrigel-cell suspension to the center of each well.\nNote: For immunofluorescence staining and confocal analysis of PKH26 labeled PDOs (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E), increase the volume of Matrigel added to resuspend the cell pellet in step 19 and add 12 μL of Matrigel-cell suspension per well of a 48-well plate, allow to set at 37°C, overlay with Complete PDO Culture Media and culture for 12 days. After 12 days, formalin fix cells and proceed with immunofluorescence staining as described in (Regan, 2022[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]).",
    "Allow Matrigel to set at 37°C for 10 min in the incubator and overlay solidified Matrigel domes with 2 mL of Complete PDO Culture Media.\nVisually inspect and record PKH26 labeling under a fluorescence microscope (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1492-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "As the PKH26 labeled single cells proliferate and self-organize into PDOs they will dilute the dye between successive daughter cells. Therefore, after 12 days in culture the majority of PDOs will be PKH26Negative and a rare minority of non-proliferating quiescent cells will remain PKH26Positive.\nAfter 12 days in culture, visually inspect Matrigel domes with a fluorescence microscope. The majority of PDO cells will be PKH26Negative. Rare PKH26Positive cells will be observed both inside and outside PDOs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nTo isolate PKH26 label retaining cells for functional testing and RNA-sequencing, process PDOs to single cells as described in steps 1–7.\nCarefully remove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 5 mL Basic PDO Culture Media containing a 1:10,000 DAPI dilution, pass through a 70 μm cell strainer into FACS tubes, place on ice and proceed with FACS.\nNote: Prepare the appropriate FACS compensation controls of unstained cells and single stained cells (freshly labeled with PKH26 or PE, e.g., EpCAM-PE only, and DAPI only).\nLoad the sample tube and create the appropriate gating strategy to isolate and sort single live DAPINegative PKH26Negative cycling cells and DAPINegative PKH26Positive non-cycling LRCs.\nCreate a Forward Scatter (FSC) versus Side Scatter (SSC) plot and adjust the individual FSC and SSC photomultiplier tube settings to ensure that all cells are visible.\nSet and adjust the FSC Threshold to remove FSC-low cellular debris.\nCreate a gate to select “all cells”.\nCreate a FSC-H vs. FSC-A (or FSC-W) plot to exclude doublets and multiplets (cells stuck together that may be counted as a single event when passing through the laser) and apply the “all cells” gate onto it.\nCreate a gate to select “singlets”.\nCreate a FSC vs. DAPI plot and apply the “singlets” gate onto it. Create a gate around the DAPINegative cells and label it “live cells”.",
    "Create a FSC vs PKH26 (PE) plot and apply the “live cells” gate.\nNote: Use the negative control to set the positive and negative gates and discern the positive signal from background fluorescence.\nPerform a purity check and make any necessary technical adjustments before proceeding with collection of cell subpopulations.\nProceed with FACS collection of cellular subpopulations for functional testing and RNA-sequencing as described below.\nNote: The number of PKH26Positive cells and their fluorescence intensity will vary between PDO models. Subpopulations of slow-cycling cells that have not had time to completely dilute the PKH26 dye may have low-to-intermediate levels of label retention (PKH26Positive/Low). Such cells can be excluded from FACS isolation by setting the gate for PKH26Positive/High cells at the far end of the PKH26Positive cell dot plot. Alternatively, if a large number of PKH26Positive/Low cells are observed, consider extending the culture period to allow further dye dilution before proceeding with FACS isolation steps.\nFunctional testing of PKH26Positive LRCs\nTiming: 20 Days\nFunctional analyses of PKH26Positive LRCs are carried out to determine their self-renewal and proliferative capacity as non-adherent spheroids and as organoids in adherent Matrigel culture, respectively.\nFor spheroid formation assays, prepare 384-well non-adherent ultra-low attachment plates by adding 100 μL Complete PDO Culture Media per well.\nSeparately sort single live PKH26Negative cells and PKH26Positive LRCs directly into 384-well plates at a frequency of one cell per well.\nNote: Adjust the frequency of cells plated per well and the number of wells used per cell dilution depending on the clonogenicity of the cell population, e.g., for less clonogenic cells, set up a limiting dilution assay in 96-well non-adherent ultra-low attachment plates with cell frequencies ranging from 1 – 100 cells per well.",
    "Visually inspect each well with a microscope to confirm the presence of a single cell per well, incubate plates at 37°C and culture for up to 20 days.\nNote: The time required for qCSCs from different PDOs to recover from sorting, exit quiescence and initiate spheroid formation may vary between models. Extend the culture period if no spheroids have formed by day 20.\nCount the number of spheroids formed by PKH26Negative cells and PKH26Positive LRCs and calculate CSC frequency using ELDA software (http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/index.html[href=http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/elda/index.html]) (Hu and Smyth, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]).\nOptional: Image each well using a microscope to measure spheroid size using ImageJ software.\nFor adherent colony forming proliferation assays, sort live PKH26Negative cells and PKH26Positive LRCs separately into chilled FACS collections tubes containing 500 μL Complete PDO Culture Media.\nDilute 10 μL of each cell suspension with 10 μL of trypan blue and place 10 μL into a hemocytometer to count live cells.\nTransfer the sorted cell suspensions to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and centrifuge at 4°C at 300×g for 3 min.\nResuspend cells at a concentration of 100 live cells per 5 μL Matrigel.\nNote: Include an additional 10% cells and Matrigel in the overall volume to account for loss during pipetting.\nRemove pre-warmed 96-well plates from the incubator and add 5 μL of Matrigel-cell suspension to the center of each well.\nNote: When pipetting small volumes of Matrigel into large multi-well plate formats it is especially important to keep pipette tips chilled. This will help to minimize solidification of Matrigel on the pipette surface and reduce loss of Matrigel-cell suspension during pipetting.\nOverlay each well with 100 μL Complete PDO Culture Media and incubate for 12 days. Wait for organoids to begin forming before changing media. Thereafter, change media every 2 days.",
    "Note: Some PDO cells may require more time to recover and form organoids after sorting.\nImage each well with a microscope, measure organoid size using ImageJ software and use CellTiter-Glo viability assay (https://www.promega.de/en/products/cell-health-assays/cell-viability-and-cytotoxicity-assays/celltiter_glo-luminescent-cell-viability-assay/[href=https://www.promega.de/en/products/cell-health-assays/cell-viability-and-cytotoxicity-assays/celltiter_glo-luminescent-cell-viability-assay/]) to determine differences in cell proliferation between the PKH26Negative cell-derived PDOs and PKH26Positive LRC-derived PDOs.\nLibrary preparation and RNA-sequencing of PKH26Positive label-retaining qCSCs\nTiming: 3–4 days\nThe RNA-seq experiments in (Regan et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]) used the Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 and Ultralow V2 Library System, which are optimized for purified total RNA in the range of 5–100 ng. However, other suitable library construction methods, such as the Universal Plus Total RNA-Seq library preparation kit with NuQaunt (Tecan) may also be used. Detailed instructions for whole transcriptome RNA amplification for preparing amplified cDNA from total RNA (https://lifesciences.tecan.com/ovation-low-input-rna-seq-kit-v2?p=tab--1[href=https://lifesciences.tecan.com/ovation-low-input-rna-seq-kit-v2?p=tab--1]) and library preparation (https://lifesciences.tecan.com/universal-rna-seq-library-prep-kit[href=https://lifesciences.tecan.com/universal-rna-seq-library-prep-kit]) can be found on the manufacturer’s website.\nCollect DAPINegative PKH26Negative cells and DAPINegative PKH26Positive LRCs by FACS from four different biological replicates into collection tubes containing RLT lysis buffer at 4°C.\nOptional: For single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), collect cells in Complete PDO Culture Media and load single cell suspensions onto a 10× Chromium platform. For detailed instruction see the manufacturer’s website (https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/library-prep/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v31-chemistry-dual-index[href=https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-gene-expression/library-prep/doc/user-guide-chromium-single-cell-3-reagent-kits-user-guide-v31-chemistry-dual-index]).\nProcess samples for RNA using an RNeasy Plus RNA extraction kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/total-rna/rneasy-plus-kits/[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/products/discovery-and-translational-research/dna-rna-purification/rna-purification/total-rna/rneasy-plus-kits/]).\nNote: Depending on the number of PKH26Positive LRCs collected, an RNeasy Micro Plus or Mini Plus extraction kit may be used. For lower cell numbers (< 5 × 105 cells, which is likely for qCSCs) it is recommended to use a Micro Plus kit.\nQuantify the amount of RNA recovered using a Qubit instrument or Nanodrop.\nNote: A Qubit Fluorometer instrument is more sensitive and preferable for quantifying low amounts of RNA. Alternatively, use a Fragment Analyzer System to assess both quality and quantity.",
    "Pause point: RNA can be stored in RLT buffer at −80°C for long-term storage (up to three months).\nConstruct cDNA libraries and perform sequencing using a next-generation sequencer (e.g., Illumina HiSeq 2500) according to the manufacturer’s (http://www.illumina.com/[href=http://www.illumina.com/]) and the sequence core facility’s instructions.\nCheck raw data in Fastq format for sample quality and map reads to the human reference genome using the STAR aligner (version 2.4.2a) (Dobin et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nCompute the total read counts per gene, e.g., using the Subread package program featureCounts.\nPerform variance-stabilizing transformation, e.g., using the Bioconductor package DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]), for normalization and differential-expression analysis comparing PKH26Negative cycling cells to PKH26Positive label-retaining qCSCs."
