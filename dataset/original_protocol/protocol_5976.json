    "Growing cellsSeed 2.0 x 105 SKBR3 cells onto sterile BSA-coated glass-bottomed dishes and cover with 2 ml of RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS and 2 nM L-Glutamine. BSA-coating minimizes non-specific binding of the fluorescent ligands (Zanetti-Domingues et al., 2012).Incubate cells with 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C for two days or until they have reached ~70% confluency.Drug treatment and labelingConjugate HER2 and HER3 Affibody ligands to the appropriate Alexa Fluor maleimide dyes according to manufacturer’s instructions. Thanks to the unique cysteine site at the C-terminus of Affibody molecules, the dye molecule:ligand molecule can be at most 1:1, but check for incomplete labeling in a spectrophotometer. Briefly:Dissolve the protein at 50-100 µM in a suitable buffer at pH 7.0-7.5 (10-100 mM phosphate, Tris, HEPES) at room temperature. Prepare a 1-10 mM stock solution of the reactive dye in DMSO immediately before use. Protect all stock solutions from light as much as possible by wrapping containers in aluminum foil. Add sufficient protein-modification reagent from a stock solution to give approximately 10-20 moles of reagent for each mole of protein. Add the reagent dropwise to the protein solution as it is stirring.Allow the reaction to proceed for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Separate the conjugate on a gel filtration column, such as a PD-10 purification column. Also see Yan, 2011.The degree of labeling can be calculated using the following formula: imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181202/20181202190124_4574.jpgwhere Ax = the absorbance value of the dye at the maximum absorption wavelength. ε = molar extinction coefficient of the dye or reagent at the maximum absorption wavelength. For Alexa 488 this is 73,000 cm-1 M-1. The MW (molecular weight) of affibodies is 6,000 Da. Therefore, assuming a 1 mg/ml protein solution has A280 = 1, their molar extinction coefficients are 6,000 cm-1 M-1.",
    "Conjugate NRGβ1 to the appropriate NHS ester Alexa Fluor dye according to manufacturer’s instructions and see above. Check dye molecule:ligand molecule ratio in a spectrophotometer and ensure that it is as close to 1:1 as possible (Protein concentration measured at 280 nm and Alexa 647 concentration measured at 647 nm. The extinction coefficient of Alexa 647, at the wavelength of maximum emission (647 nm), is 270,000 cm-1 M-1).Ensure that the NRG-dye conjugate is as active as the unlabeled protein by performing control Western Blot or ELISA assays for HER3 and HER4 phosphorylation. Briefly for cell culture and Western Blotting: Seed MCF7 cells at 0.5 x 105 cells/well in 24-well plates using DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS as growth media. Using FuGENE HD, transfect cells with HER3 or HER4 plasmid DNA (follow the manufacturer’s instructions). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, treat pre-chilled cells with ice-cold 10 nM NRG-Alexa 647 in PBS and incubate for 1 h at 4 °C. Lyse cells in 1x sample buffer containing 1 mM DTT, protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Sonicate and centrifuge before running on SDS-PAGE gel (using XCell apparatus from Invitrogen) alongside HiMark Prestained HMW and Novex Sharp Prestained protein standards (Invitrogen). Transfer to a membrane and analyze by Western blotting. Briefly, first bind anti-HER2 pY877 or anti-HER3 pY1289 from Cell Signaling Technology (follow the manufacturer’s instructions) and then the species-specific secondary antibody conjugated to HRP (Horse-radish peroxidase) from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Develop the blot using the Supersignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate solution from Pierce. Image with a BioRad ChemiDoc MP system Imager and analyze using densitometry in ImageJ. After stripping the blot of antibodies, reprobe with anti-Total HER2 or anti-Total HER3, antibodies and then the species-specific secondary antibody conjugated to HRP. Develop and analyze as above.",
    "Change the media on the cells to serum-free RPMI 1640 media (SFM) including, if required, 14 nM Lapatinib or 41 nM Bosutinib. Incubate all dishes at 37 °C/5% CO2 for two hours.Using a serological pipette and electronic pipette filler/dispenser, remove the cell media and replace with 1 ml PBS to wash. Remove the PBS to add 1 ml of fresh PBS including the appropriate drug treatment if required. Chill all samples on ice at 4 °C for 10 min (to minimize receptor internalization).Incubate half of the samples in 1 ml of 100 nM HER2Affibody-Alexa488 and 50 nM HER3Affibody-Alexa647 diluted in ice-cold PBS and, if required, the appropriate drug (either 14 nM Lapatinib or 41 nM Bosutinib).Incubate the remaining dishes in 1 ml of 100 nM HER2Affibody-Alexa488 and 10 nM NRG-Alexa647 diluted in ice-cold PBS and, if required, the appropriate drug. Incubate all the dishes on ice for at least 1 h. Wash three times each with 1 ml of ice-cold PBS.Fix cells with 1 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde diluted into ice-cold PBS. To ensure complete fixation, incubate cells on ice at 4 °C for 30 min-1 h, then wash three times using 1 ml of PBS per wash.Store samples at 4 °C in PBS and prior to imaging supplement fresh PBS with 50 mM cysteamine HCl (total volume 1 ml).ImagingSupplement objective lens (1.46 NA 100x oil immersion objective) with immersion oil and mount sample on microscope stage (Figure 1 and see https://applications.zeiss.com/C125792900358A3F/0/8DF1FE51A0C52599C1257C1D0073F96D/$FILE/EN_41_011_061_ELYRA.pdf for microscope setup).Locate sample using eyepiece and set up a 2 dimensional (2D), 2 color dSTORM (Endesfelder and Heilemann, 2015) experiment using the 488 nm and 641 nm excitation laser lines in separate tracks with the appropriate filters (a possible setup for this pair of dyes would be BP420-480/BP495-560/LP650).",
    "See Figure 2 (left) for parameter settings in Zen software.Locate a cell and position it in the center of the field of view (FOV) then refocus, ensuring that the entire cell membrane is clearly in focus (Figure 2 [right] for example image). Using TIRF illumination, gradually increase laser powers separately for each channel to excite the Alexa 488 and Alexa 647 fluorophores and push them towards quasi-equilibrium (Dempsey et al., 2011).Acquire dSTORM raw data over 10,000 frames with exposure time 20 ms, EM gain 250, alternating the lasers to image the two receptors sequentially every 300 frames.Use the 405 nm laser line, if necessary, at low power (< 1%) to aid fluorophore blinking at any time. During acquisition use excitation laser powers of ~9-10 kW/cm2 at the sample (we used 7.6-11.7 kW/cm2, average 8.9 kW/cm2 for 488 nm laser and 7.6 -13.8 kW/cm2, average 10.4 kW/cm2 for 640 nm laser). Low levels of 405 nm laser can also be used (0.001-0.005 kW/cm2).Repeat imaging procedure to obtain dSTORM data for at least 12 regions (25.6 µm x 25.6 µm) per treatment group with each region including at least one cell. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181202/20181202185724_6641.jpgFigure 1.

    "Number of frames; 6. Exposure time; 7. EM gain. 8. Frames per cycle.Use the PALM function in ZEN software to process and render the images (Figure 3). Use ZEN to first define the point spread function (PSF) mask size (typically 9 pixels, max 10 pixels) and intensity to noise ratio (typically 6) then apply to localize each blinking event using a 2D Gaussian fit model. Take overlapping fluorophores into account using the Account for overlap setting. Correct for displacements of molecules in the lateral plane from drifts using feature detection and cross-correlation methods in the PAL-Drift tab.Implement channel alignment (Figure 4) of the reconstructed images using a standard MultiSpec bead sample.Co-ordinates of the localizations in the final reconstructed images (typically 30,000+ for HER2 and 5,000+ for HER3 per region, Figure 3) are passed into the Bayesian cluster identification algorithm designed by Dylan Owen et al. (Griffié et al., 2016).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181202/20181202185803_6337.jpgFigure 3. Zen settings for data analysis parameters. 1. PALM function. 2.
