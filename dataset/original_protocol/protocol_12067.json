    "Microinjection of larvae was approved by the Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care under Protocol 2011N000127.\n1. Device Fabrication\nNOTE: All computer assisted drawing (CAD) files used to design photolithography masks described here (Figure 1) are available for download. See Table of Materials for links.\nFabricate the master mold wafer in a Class 1,000 clean room using standard photolithographic techniques7. For the microstructure arrays and channels, pattern the epoxy-based negative photoresist sequentially in 3 layers using 3 separate masks, according to the manufacturer's instructions: 100 µm for the shallow features, 200 µm for the medium features, and 400 µm for the deep features. For the imaging device, pattern two layers using 400 µm for the shallow features and 600 µm for the deep features.\nTape the completed wafer to the base of a 15 cm Petri dish for casting (Figure 2).\n2. Preparation of Microstructured Surface Arrays - PDMS\nTo make usable devices, cast polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), using the master wafer as a mold. Combine 50 g of PDMS monomer with 5 g of initiator and mix thoroughly in a plastic weighing dish with a plastic fork.\nPour mixture carefully over the mold.\nDegas in a vacuum desiccator at 16-25 inHg (54-85 kPa) for 1 h.\nTo cure the PDMS, bake at 65 °C for at least 3 h. The PDMS should cure to a firm but flexible solid.\nCarefully cut around the device on the master wafer using a scalpel, making sure to maintain contact between the tip of the scalpel and the wafer surface. Using forceps, peel the PDMS replica away from the wafer and transfer to a clean 10 cm Petri dish, feature side up (Figure 3).\nTreat the device with oxygen plasma using a plasma oven for 35 s to reduce hydrophobicity.",
    "Cover with zebrafish embryo medium (E3) containing 168 mg/L of ethyl 3-aminobenoate methanesulfonate (MS-222, pH 7.5). Remove any bubbles from deeper features by flowing water over the surface of the device using a transfer pipette.\n3. Preparation of Microstructured Surface Arrays - Agarose\nTo make a negative PDMS mold, first treat a PDMS device with oxygen plasma.\nTreat the PDMS device with 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane (PFDTS) silane vapor to create an inert surface8. Briefly:\nPlace the PDMS to be treated feature-side-up in a vacuum chamber within a fume hood.\nNext to the PDMS, place a small open glass or aluminum dish, and carefully pipette 200 µL of PFDTS (98% silane) into the dish.\n\t\tCaution: PFDTS silane is highly volatile, reacts violently with water, is flammable, and causes severe skin and eye damage on contact. Read MSDS in detail before use.\nClose the vacuum chamber and apply vacuum for 15-30 min, or until the PFDTS silane is completely evaporated.\nPlace the device in a Petri dish and use as a mold for fresh PDMS, prepared as described in step 2.1-2.3.\nBake at 65 °C for at least 3 h, then peel the entire layer of fresh PDMS from the treated device and place in a fresh Petri dish. This can then be used as a negative mold to cast agarose.\nTo prepare agarose, boil a 2% solution of low gelling temperature agarose in E3 in a microwave until the agarose is fully dissolved.\nPour the hot agarose over the PDMS negative mold and remove any bubbles in the agarose covering the device by flowing hot agarose over the features with a transfer pipette.\nOnce bubbles are removed, refrigerate at 4 °C to set the agarose.",
    "Remove the agarose block from the negative PDMS mold by deforming the PDMS from underneath by hand, transfer the agarose block to a new Petri dish, and wet with E3 containing MS-222.\n4. Preparation of PDMS Imaging Devices\nTo make usable devices, cast PDMS, using the master wafer as a mold. Combine 50 g of PDMS monomer with 5 g of initiator (same as used in step 2.1) and mix thoroughly in a plastic weighing dish with a plastic fork.\nPour mixture carefully over the mold.\nDegas in a vacuum desiccator at 16-25 inHg (54-85 kPa) for 1 h.\nTo cure the PDMS, bake at 65 °C for at least 3 h. The PDMS should cure to a firm but flexible solid.\nCut the devices from the Master Wafer and punch out ports using a 1.5 mm punch.\nTreat the devices and a 6-well glass-bottom well plate with oxygen plasma for 35 s, as described in step 2.6.\nBond one device feature-side-down to each glass coverslip of the 6-well plate by placing it on an 85 °C hotplate for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: To confirm successful bonding, apply firm pressure to one side of the bonded device using forceps. The device should remain attached to the glass coverslip.\n5. Zebrafish Culture\nCulture zebrafish embryos to 2 dpf using standard techniques3.\nDechorionate embryos using forceps or 1 mg/mL protease mix (see Materials Table)3 at least 30-60 mins prior to loading onto device, to allow them to straighten.\nAnaesthetize embryos using (168 mg/L) MS-222 (pH 7.5) by adding 1 mL of 25X stock solution to the E3 in their Petri dish.\n6. Orientation of Zebrafish on Microstructured Surface - Divot Arrays",
    "Prepare the PDMS block from step 2.7 (Figure 3A) in its Petri dish such that it is covered by a thin (1-2 mm) layer of E3, which allows easier manipulation of the embryos.\nTransfer required number of embryos (generally 10-20 per condition) onto the surface of the PDMS block using a transfer pipette.\nUsing a micromanipulation tool (hair loop or similar), push the embryos into the microstructured divots (Figure 3A). Use of divots is particularly suited to dorsal and ventral orientations.\n\tNOTE: For the divots with a tighter fit (dorsal and ventral), try positioning the embryos on the surface of the block in parallel to the divot, and then rolling them into position using a hair loop. Pushing them deeper into the divot will help to keep them stable.\n7. Orientation of Zebrafish on Microstructured Surface - Microstructured Channels\nDraw E3 off the PDMS block patterned with microstructured channels (Figure 3B) using a transfer pipette until the level of E3 drops below the edge of the block, but is still present in the reservoir and channels and in a thin layer on the PDMS.\nTransfer 10 embryos from step 5.3 into the reservoir using a transfer pipette, being careful not to overflow the edges.\nUsing a hair loop, manipulate each embryo into the funnel at the entrance of the appropriate channel and orient such that the head of the embryo is toward the channel and the embryo has the appropriate orientation as it enters the channel.\nSlide each embryo down the channel using a hair loop until it reaches the orienting microfeatures in the channel walls that help to keep it in place. Use of microstructured channels is particularly recommended for the lateral orientation.",
    "NOTE: To reduce embryo sliding during microinjection, try adjusting the amount of surface tension by drawing E3 from the reservoir.\n8. Microinjection of Zebrafish\nPrepare microinjection needle.\nMake borosilicate glass microcapillary needles using a micropipette puller as previously described4. The resulting needles should be tapered to a point at one end, with a taper length of approximately 10 mm.\nPrepare solution to be injected, in this case 100 nM chemoattractant (N-Formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) or Leukotriene B4 (LTB4)) and 100 nM of 70 kDa Rhodamine dextran tracer in PBS.\nLoad 5 µL of solution into the needle using a finely tapered pipette tip (see materials table).\nMount the needle into a micromanipulator mounted on a magnetic stand and connected to a picopump microinjector.\nBreak the tip of needle at a 45 ° angle by pinching the tapered tip with forceps.\nAdjust injection bolus size to 1 nL by adjusting the injection time on the picopump controller.\nAdjust the angle of the microinjection needle. A needle angle of 45 ° on the micromanipulation controller is generally a good starting point, with the needle parallel to the length of the embryo. A steeper angle may be used to minimize lateral movement of the embryo during microinjection.\nControlling the Petri dish with the left hand and the needle micromanipulator with the right, bring the needle as close as possible to the intended site of microinjection, in this case the otic vesicle.\n\tNOTE: The otic vesicle can be identified as the oblong organ posterior to the eye containing two smaller distinct dark oblong structures (otoliths).\nUsing the micromanipulation controller, penetrate the target tissue (in this case the otic vesicle) such that the tip of the needle is within the vesicle, and inject the preset volume using the picopump foot switch.",
    "NOTE: If the tissue resists penetration, try gently tapping the micromanipulation controller knob.\nTo release the embryos, flow E3 over the surface from top to bottom using a transfer pipette, or by swirling the dish such that the embryos are released into the surrounding E3.\nTransfer the embryos to a recovery dish of E3 without MS-222 using a transfer pipette.\n9. Screening of Embryos Using the PDMS Imaging Device\nPrime the device from step 4.7 by flowing E3 (+ MS-222) through the port. This can be done using either a 1,000 µL pipette or a narrow-tip transfer pipette.\nFill the well with E3 + MS-222 until the device is covered.\nDeliver 4 injected embryos from step 8.7 into each well using a transfer pipette. Embryos can be pre-anesthetized if desired by incubating in E3 + MS-222 for 1-2 min prior to loading (step 5.3).\nUsing a micromanipulation tool (hair loop or similar), orient the embryos at the entrances of the imaging channels in the desired orientation (tail-first or head-first, depending on the device used), and push them partially into the device (Figure 4A). This will help draw them into the device evenly.\nDraw E3 through the device from the port using either a 1,000 µL pipette or transfer pipette until the embryos are drawn into the channels in the correct orientation for imaging (Figure 4B).\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to suck the embryos past the trapping point, this will damage the embryos and alter their orientation.\nTransfer well-plate to microscope for imaging (Figure 4C).\nImage using an inverted fluorescent microscope.\nAdjust magnification by selecting the appropriate lens. 10X is usually a useful magnification for imaging zebrafish neutrophil migration.\nAdjust light source intensity and exposure time for each channel so that each signal is clear, but not saturated.",
    "Capture images for each channel. Here, we used green fluorescent protein (GFP, Ex: 470/22, Em: 525/50), Texas Red (TxRed, Ex: 585/29, Em: 628/32) and Transmitted channels. Multichannel images can be combined during post-processing (Figure 4B-I).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
