    "Animal experiments were approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital.\n1. Preparation of the reagents and animals\nDissolve doxorubicin hydrochloride (Pfizer, USA) in sterilized water. Vortex to obtain a Dox solution of 1 mg/mL and keep at 4 °C.\nUse C57BL/6 mice (8–10 weeks old; 25–30 g weight). For this study, mice were purchased from the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University and kept in the animal room of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital.\nPathogen-free mouse cages were maintained under a 12 h light/dark cycle at a constant temperature of 23 °C. All animals were fed on a normal chow diet and got food and water ad libitum.\n2. Establishment of DCM animal model\nRandomize mice into a normal (n = 5) group and Dox (n = 5) group.\nAdminister the Dox solution intraperitoneally at a dose of 5 mg/kg using a 1 mL sterilized syringe 1x a week for the Dox group. Treat the control mice in the same way with the same amount of saline solution.\nMeasure the body weight of the two groups weekly. Accordingly, adjust the injection dose based on body weight weekly for a total of 4 weeks, with a cumulative dose of 20 mg/kg (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: A time period of 4 weeks was chosen because echocardiography at 4 weeks showed a significant difference in cardiac function between the two groups.\n3. Echocardiographic examination\nAt the end of the fourth week, conduct an echocardiographic examination of the mice.\nAnesthetize the mice with 2% isoflurane intranasally. If the mice do not respond to a pinch of the skin with a toothed tweezer or stimulating the toes and tails, continue with the protocol.",
    "Place the mouse on an animal-handling platform in the supine position. To maintain the anesthesia, cover the animal's nose and mouth with a nose cone and deliver 2% isoflurane.\n\tNOTE: For IP anesthesia, inject 4% chloral hydrate at a dose of 0.2 mL/20 g.\nRemove chest fur carefully with an electric shaver. Assess cardiac function in vivo using transthoracic echocardiography.\nPerform the LV echocardiogram in both the parasternal long-axis and short-axis views at a frame rate of 233 Hz. End-systolic and end-diastolic dimensions were defined as the phases corresponding to the ECG T wave and to the R wave, respectively.\nOn the M-mode tracings, measure the average LV end-systolic diameter (LVIDd), LV end-diastolic diameter (LVIDs), interventricular septal thickness (IVS), and LV posterior wall thickness (LVPW) from 3–5 heart beats. Also calculate the ejection fraction (EF) and fraction shortening (FS) based on echocardiography.\n4. Histological staining\nAfter the echocardiographic analysis, sacrifice the mice by intraventricular injection of 10% potassium chloride.\nPerfuse the heart with about 30 mL of saline after dissection until the liver and lung become pale.\nExcise the heart and thoroughly wash it in phosphate buffer solution to extrude blood.\nFix the heart in 4% formalin at room temperature for 24 h and treat the tissue in a paraffin box so that the paraffin wax cools down and solidifies.\nCut the hearts into 5 μm thick slices for pathological staining.\nDewax and rehydrate sections containing papillary muscle.\n\t\nIncubate slides at 55 °C for 30 min. Then, incubate in xylene 2x for 2 min each; 100% ethanol 2x for 2 min each; 95% ethanol 2x for 2 min each; 80% ethanol for 2 min; 75% ethanol for 2 min; and 50% ethanol for 2 min.\nStain using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) as well as Masson’s stain.",
