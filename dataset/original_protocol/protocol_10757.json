    "1. BioBrick Assembly\nBioBricks from the Registry of Standard Biological parts are provided by iGEM headquarters. To construct a new BioBrick from existing BioBricks, digest the donor BioBrick (up to 1.0 μg) with the enzymes EcoRI and SpeI for positioning the donor part downstream of the acceptor part. Digest with XbaI and PstI for positioning the donor part upstream of the acceptor part. Add a third appropriate restriction enzyme that cuts in the backbone of the donor. Perform the digestions in a total volume of 20-25 ml with the appropriate buffer, according to the supplier (final concentration 1x). Use 5 units/μg DNA for the restriction enzymes.\nDigest the acceptor BioBrick with either EcoRI and XbaI or SpeI and PstI.\nIncubate the digestions for (at least) one hr at 37 °C. Inactivate the restriction endonucleases by heat, incubation at 80 °C for 10 min and centrifuge shortly.\nLigate the digested BioBrick parts (donor and acceptor) together. Since XbaI and SpeI generate compatible DNA ends, a mixed site is created that cannot be cut with any restriction enzyme resulting in a new 'combined' BioBrick that flanked by the 4 standard restriction sites. In the ligation mixture the final DNA concentration is preferably ~100 ng/μl. Perform the ligation reaction in a total volume of 10-15 ml with the T4 ligation buffer (final concentration 1x) and T4 ligase (1 unit/μg DNA).\nIncubate the ligation mixture at 16 °C for at least 3 hr.\nPerform transformation reaction with circa half of the ligation mix.\nConfirm the BioBrick to be correct with sequencing.",
    "To construct a new BioBrick from synthesized DNA, modify the genes for synthesis for optimal expression in E. coli by means of the JCat website tool (http://www.jcat.de/[href=http://www.jcat.de/]). Make further modifications in accordance with the requirements of the BioBrick standard. This standardization implies that every BioBrick is composed of a DNA sequence of interest preceded by a prefix and followed by a suffix. The prefix and suffix are sequences that contain predefined restriction sites, that are absent in the remaining plasmid sequence. These standard restriction sites make it possible to interchange and extend the BioBrick inserts flexibly 9. The prefix and suffix have the following sequences:\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2\nName,Sequence,Comment\nPrefix,5' GAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAG3',\n,5' GAATTCGCGGCCGCTTCTAGAG 3',\"If the following part is a coding sequence or any part that starts with \"\"ATG\"\"\"\nSuffix,5' TACTAGTAGCGGCCGCTGCAG 3',\n2. Alkane Conversion Resting Cell Assay, In Vivo\nThis assay was performed based on the method described by Fujii et al. (2004).\nCulture E. coli cells expressing the Alkane Hydroxylase system (BBa_K398014[href=http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398014]) and cells carrying an empty vector (BBa_J13002[href=http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J13002]) in 5 ml LB medium with appropriate antibiotics overnight.\nTransfer 500 μl of the overnight culture into 50 ml of fresh LB (with antibiotic) and incubate until the cell turbidity reached an OD (optical density) of 0.3 at 600 nm.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 4,000 rpm and resuspend the pellet in 5 ml 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).\nCentrifuge again for 10 min at 4,000 rpm and resuspend the pellet in 5 ml 0.1 M phosphate buffer now containing E2 salts and 0.66% v/v glycerol (nitrogen-deficient medium).\nMeasure the cell turbidity (OD600).\nPrepare cell-mixture aliquots of 6 ml in 25 ml closed-cap glass flasks and no-cell controls (E2 salts + 0.66% v/v glycerol).\nAdd 100 nmol of alkane to each flask.",
    "Incubate the mixtures at 37 °C for 24 hr (shorten when higher rates are obtained).\nMeasure the OD600 after incubation.\nExtract the hydrocarbons in the culture media by ethyl acetate and determine hydrocarbon concentration in cell culture by gas chromatography (see protocol 3).\nCalculate the degradation per unit of biomass by dividing the total amount of alkane converted by the total biomass present in each flask (convert OD600 to dry weight). Dividing the result by the experimental duration yields the degradation activity per unit biomass per time unit. The average is taken from three individual runs.\n3. Alkane Conversion Enzyme Assay, In Vitro\nThis assay was performed essentially according to the method described by Li et al. (2008).\nCulture E. coli cells expressing the ladA gene (BBa_K398017[href=http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398017]) and cells carrying an empty vector (BBa_J13002[href=http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J13002]) in 50 ml LB medium with appropriate antibiotics overnight.\nTransfer 500 μl of the overnight culture into 50 ml of fresh LB (with antibiotic) and incubate until the cell turbidity reached an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm.\nCentrifuge 10 min at 4,000 rpm (4 °C) and resuspend the pellet in 5 ml of 50 mM Tris buffer.\nSonicate (Cell disrupter, LA Biosystems) the cells at 40% duty cycle with an output control of 4, keep the solution on ice for the entire duration.\nCentrifuge the resulting mixture for 5 min at 4,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove the cell debris. Transfer the supernatant to a fresh vial.\nDetermine the total protein concentration of the cell extracts by Bradford assay. Note: Use glass vials to prevent the increase of background and/or loss of protein.\nPrepare a 100 ml mixture containing 0.1% v/v alkane and 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer.",
    "Heat the mixture at 100 °C for 5 min. Note: Perform this step only for medium-long chain alkanes with high boiling point. (e.g. C16: 287 °C).\nTo achieve an optimal solubility of the alkane, sonicate for 1 min while still warm until a homogenous, viscous mixture is obtained.\nAdd 1mM of NADH, 1 mM FMN, 1 mM MgSO4 and 0.01 v/v Triton X-100.\nPrepare 6 ml aliquots in 25 ml closed-cap flasks.\nAdd adequate amounts of cell extract (depends on Bradford assays, final concentration of 5 mg protein/l). Prepare a no-protein control.\nIncubate at 60 °C (for optimal enzymatic activity) for 24 hr.\nExtract the hydrocarbons in the culture media by ethyl acetate and determine hydrocarbon concentration in cell culture by gas chromatography (see protocol 3).\nCalculate the degradation per unit of biomass by dividing the total amount of alkane converted by total protein added to each flask (by Bradford calibration curve). Further dividing by experiment duration yields the degradation activity per unit of cellular protein per time unit. The average is taken from three individual runs.\n4. Ethyl Acetate Hydrocarbon Extraction and Concentration Measurements\nAlkanes are extracted from the aqueous solution by adding 2.5 ml ethyl acetate (apolar solvant) to 6 ml experimental solution. An internal standard is added to the solvent at a concentration of 0.1 % (v/v). The standard (e.g. cyclo-decan) varied depending on the expected range of the peaks of interest.\nOptional: Add Triton X-100 to the aqueous mixture and centrifuge the samples for 10 min at 4,000 rpm in order to get a proper bi-phasic system.\nVortex the mixture for 5 sec (1,500 rpm) and incubate at room temperature until the two phases separate.\nRemove a maximal amount of the organic layer (top) and dry the solvent using anhydrous magnesium sulphate.",
    "Remove MgSO4 by filtration (0.2 μm) and transfer the filtrate into gas chromatograph vials for measurements, or store at -20 °C.\nDetermine the concentration by gas chromatography using a CP-SIL 5CB column (length = 5 m). Inject 10 μl of sample in split mode (1:10, 230 °C). Set the column gas flow to 1 ml/min (Helium). The following oven temperature program is used:\n table:\n﻿0,1,2\nRate,Temperature [°C],Time [min]\n0,50,7.5\n50,90,1.0\n50,110,2.0\n50,130,2.0\n50,145,2.0\n50,160,2.0\n50,170,2.0\n50,185,2.0\n50,210,2.0\n50,250,2.0\n50,320,2.0\nIntegrate peaks and correct the concentrations with respect to the internal standard.\n5. Alcohol/aldehyde Dehydrogenase Activity Assay\nThis assay was performed essentially according to the method described by Kato et al. (2010).\nCulture E. coli cells expressing the ADH (BBa_K398018[href=http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398018]) or ALDH (BBa_K398030[href=http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398030]) gene and cells carrying an empty vector (BBa_J13002[href=http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_J13002]) in 50 ml LB medium with appropriate antibiotics overnight.\nTransfer 500 μl of the overnight culture into 50 ml of fresh LB (with antibiotic) and incubate until the cell turbidity reached an optical density of 0.6 at 600 nm.\nCentrifuge 10 min at 4,000 rpm at 4 °C and resuspend the pellet in 5 ml of 50 mM Tris buffer.\nSonicate the cell solution at 40% duty cycle with an output control of 4 (keep the solution on ice during the sonication).\nCentrifuge the resulting mixture for 5 min at 4,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove cell debris.\nDetermine the total protein concentration of the cell extracts by Bradford assay (Note: use a glass vial to prevent protein binding).\nLoad a 96 well plate with 180 μl 57 mM glycine buffer containing NAD (final concentration 1 mM, pH 9.5) in each well.",
    "Add 5 μl of the alcohol (aldehyde) to be tested to the wells. Note: Heat long chain alcohols before the start of the assay to have a liquid. For each alcohol (aldehyde) a control without substrate should be added (negative control). In addition, prepare a blank containing a mixture of buffer and the substrate without cell extract.\nPreheat the plate of the plate reader (Tecan Magellan v7.0) for 15 min at 37 °C to allow equilibration of the system.\nAdd adequate amounts of cell extract (depends on Bradford assays, final concentration of 5 mg protein/l). Prepare a no-protein control.\nMeasure the NADH production using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 340 nm every 2-3 min for 1 hr at 37 °C.\nCalculate the NADH production rate from the slope of the OD (340 nm). Take into account the light path length and the extinction coefficient of NADH of 6220 M-1cm-1. Divide the NADH production rate by the total amount of protein added to express the activity of the dehydrogenase reaction in the cell extract (U/mg whole cell protein). Calculate the mean and the standard deviation from three independent runs.\n6. pCaiF Characterization\nCulture E. coli cells expressing the pCaiF-GFP construct (BBa_K398331[href=http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398331]) and cells carrying the promoter alone (BBa_K398326[href=http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398326]) overnight in 5 ml LB medium the appropriate antibiotics overnight.\nInoculate 5 ml M9 containing 10 g/l glucose and antibiotics with 50 μl of the overnight culture and grow overnight.\nSubculture 50 μl of the overnight outgrowth into 5 ml of fresh M9 with10 g/l and incubate until the cell turbidity reached an optical density of 0.2 at 600 nm.",
    "Load a 96 well plate with 100 μl of fresh M9 medium containing the desired amount of carbon source for testing in each well. Perform triplicate experiments for statistical evaluation and add the respective negative controls (wild-type E. coli K12).\nAdd 5 μl of the overnight culture to the medium containing wells.\nMeasure the growth curve (OD600) and GFP fluorescence (485 nm excitation and 520 emission) using a plate reader every 10 min for 18 hr at 37 °C with constant shaking.\nCalculate the growth rate and the specific GFP content from the respective measurements and compare to the control. Calculate the mean and the standard deviation of at least three independent experiments.\n7. Tolerance Assay\nCulture E. coli expressing PhPFDα and β gene (BBa_K398406[href=http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398406]) overnight in 5 ml LB medium and the appropriate antibiotics. E. coli expressing ladA gene (BBa_K398017[href=http://partsregistry.org/Part:BBa_K398017]) is used as negative control.\nSubculture 10 μl of the overnight outgrowth into fresh 5 ml of LB (with antibiotic) and incubate until the cell turbidity reached an optical density of 0.3 to 0.4 at 600 nm.\nDilute the cultures with fresh medium until an OD600 of 0.1 is reached.\nLoad a 96 well plate with 180 μl M9 medium containing the appropriate antibiotics and the proper final concentration of the toxic compound (e.g. 0, 4, 8, 10% of n-hexane) in triplicate. Because alkane-water mixtures could lead to two-phase systems it is essential to have appropriate controls on the plate (e.g. different strains and the respective blank experiments).\nAdd 20 μl of the culture (control) into the wells.\nMeasure the biomass concentration (OD600) using a plate reader every 10 min for 24 hr at 37 °C with constant shaking.",
    "Calculate the growth rates from the respective measurements for the different agent concentrations and compare to the negative control. Calculate the mean and the standard deviation of at least three independent runs.\n8. Homolog Interaction Mapping\nThe application HIM was developed to perform protein queries on a PostgreSQL server running the STRING database (free for academic use) 20. The homologue interaction mapping application identifies interacting proteins in the original host organism using the STRING database. The sequences of the respective interacting genes are used in a BLAST search to find homologous genes in the target organism. Cytoscape 4 is used to visualize the result of the mapping. The HIM software tool can be downloaded at: https://github.com/jcnossen/InteractionHomologMapping.[href=https://github.com/jcnossen/InteractionHomologMapping]\nTo perform a mapping, (1) enter the BioBrick ID and the application will automatically download the part sequence data from the Registry of Standard Biological Parts 9, or (2) enter (paste) the sequence data in the application.\nUse the STRING Database website to find the STRING protein ID for the entered amino acid sequence.\nA protein with high homology is determined using BLAST. Subsequently the application lists each known interacting protein in the source organism and searches for homologs in the host organism (e.g. E. coli).\nExport resulting putative interaction list to text or Cytoscape.\nSubscription Required.
