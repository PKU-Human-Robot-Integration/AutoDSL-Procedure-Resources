    "1. Preparations before beginning the experiment\nPrepare lysis buffer stock.\n\tNOTE: The optimal nuclear isolation buffer can be different for each cell type. We recommend testing both the hypotonic buffer used in the original paper8 and a CSK buffer12,13 for each cell type using trypan blue staining.\n\t\nTo prepare hypotonic buffer (Greenleaf buffer), mix 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl, 3 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% NP-40.\nTo prepare CSK buffer, mix 10 mM PIPES pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl, 300 mM sucrose, 3 mM MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100.\nEnsure that the cell culture conditions are optimal; examine the cells under a light microscope to make sure that there are no elevated levels of apoptosis.\nTurn on the centrifuge to let it reach 4 °C.\n2. Cell harvest\nAspirate media from a culture of cells at <80% confluency. Cells are typically grown in a 35 mm or 60 mm dish, based on the number of cells needed, treatments, etc.\nWash the cells with 1 mL or 3 mL of PBS.\nAdd 0.5 mL or 1 mL of Trypsin and incubate for 2-3 min (depending on the cell types). Carefully use a 1 mL pipette to mix well.\nAdd 1 mL or 2 mL of media to the plate and mix well. Transfer to a 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge the cells in a 15 mL tube for 3 min at 300 x g.\n\tNOTE: A swinging bucket rotor is recommended to minimize cell loss.\nAspirate the media and resuspend the cells in 1 mL or 2 mL of medium.",
    "NOTE: It is critical to prepare a homogenous single-cell solution. For tissues, a Dounce homogenizer can be used to homogenize tissues and minimize large cell clumps or aggregates. Some tissues require filtration (e.g., cell strainers) and/or FACS cell sorting to isolate viable cells and obtain a single cell solution.\nCount the cells using a cell counter.\n\tNOTE: In this study, an automated cell counter (Table of Materials) was used.\nCentrifuge the required cell volume (e.g., a volume containing 1 x 106 cells based on cell count) at 300 x g for 3 min at room temperature (RT).\nResuspend the cell pellet containing 1 x 106 cells in 1 mL of cold PBS.\n\tNOTE: If cell numbers are less than 1 x 106 cells, decrease the cold PBS volume to prepare the cell solution at the same concentration (1 x 106 cells/mL).\n3. Cell lysis\nTransfer 25 µL (= 2.5 x 104 cells) to a new 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube. Centrifuge for 5 min at 500 x g at 4 °C and carefully discard the supernatant\n\tNOTE: A swinging bucket rotor is recommended to minimize cell loss. Leave about 3 µL of supernatant to ensure that the cells are not being discarded.\nAdd 25 µL of lysis buffer and resuspend the cells by gentle pipetting up and down. Incubate on ice for 5 min\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 500 x g at 4 °C and carefully discard the supernatant.\n\tNOTE: A swinging bucket rotor is recommended to minimize cell loss. Leave about 3 µL of supernatant to ensure that the cells are not being discarded.\n4. Tn5 tagmentation",
    "Immediately resuspend the pellet in 25 µL of Tn5 reaction mixture. The Tn5 reaction mixture is as follows: 12.5 µL of 2x Tagmentation DNA buffer (TD buffer), 1.25-5 µL of Tn5 transposase, and 11.25-7.5 µL of nuclease-free water.\n\tNOTE: The standard concentration of Tn5 is 2.5 µL for 2.5 x 104 cells.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37 °C.\n\t​NOTE: Mix the solution every 10 min.\n5. DNA purification\nNOTE: Purification is required before amplification. DNA purification is done using the MinElute PCR purification kit (Table of Materials).\nAdd 5 µL of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2).\nImmediately add 125 µL of Buffer PB and mix well.\nFollow the PCR purification kit protocol starting at step 2.\n\t\nPlace the spin column in a 2 mL collection tube.\nApply the sample to the spin column and centrifuge for 1 min at 17,900 x g at RT.\nDiscard the flow-through and place the spin column back in the same collection tube.\nAdd 750 µL of Buffer PE to the spin column and centrifuge for 1 min at 17,900 x g at RT.\nDiscard the flow-through and place the spin column back in the same collection tube.\nCentrifuge the spin column for 5 min to dry the membrane completely.\nDiscard the flow-through and place the spin column in a new 1.7 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nElute the DNA fragments with 10 µL of Buffer EB.\nLet the column stand for 1 min at RT.\nCentrifuge for 1 min at 17,900 x g at RT to elute the DNA.\n6. PCR amplification\nNOTE: PCR amplification of transposed (tagmented) DNAs is necessary for sequencing. Nextera kit adapters (Table of Materials) were used in this example. The primers used in this study are listed in Table 1.",
    "Set up the following PCR reaction in 200 µL PCR tubes (50 µL for each sample). The PCR reaction mixture is as follows: 10 µL of eluted DNA (step 5.), 2.5 µL of 25 mM Adapter 1, 2.5 µL of 25 mM Adapter 2, 25 µL of 2x PCR master mix, and 10 µL of nuclease-free water\nPerform PCR amplification program part 1 (Table 2).\n\tNOTE: For initial amplification, the same conditions are used for all samples using a standard thermal cycler.\nReal-time qPCR (total of 14.5 µL per sample)\n\t\nUsing 5 µL of the product from the PCR amplification part 1 (step 6.2.), set up the following reaction, this time including SYBR gold and detection in a real-time PCR machine.\nPrepare the PCR reaction mixture as follows: 5 µL of PCR product from step 6.2., 0.75 µL of SYBR gold (1000x diluted), 5 µL of 2x PCR master mix, and 3.75 µL of nuclease-free water.\n\t\t​NOTE: The precise cycle numbers for library amplification before reaching saturation for each sample are determined by qPCR (Table 3) to reduce the GC and size bias in PCR10. SYBR Gold was diluted with nuclease-free water. To make the diluted solution, 1 µL of SYBR Gold (stock concentration 10,000x) was added to 999 µL of nuclease-free water. The run time of RT-qPCR mentioned in Table 3 is about 60 min.\nDetermine the required number of additional PCR cycles using the run parameters from step 6.3.\n\t\nNumber of cycles = 1/4 maximum (saturated) fluorescence intensity (typically 3 or 4 PCR cycles)",
    "PCR amplification program part 2 (volume = 45 µL; Table 4): Once you determine the cycle number, set up PCRs with additional cycles calculated at step 6.4.1. For instance, if the cycle number calculated is 3, set up 3 cycles in the program below. The total cycles would be 8 (5 in step 6.2., plus 3 additional cycles in step 6.5.)\n7. Beads purification\nNOTE: Here, AMPure XP (Table of Materials) beads were used.\nTo the PCR products amplified in the previous step, add 150 µL of beads at RT.\n\tNOTE: Homemade AMPure beads14 can be used in this process.\nIncubate for 15 min at RT.\nPlace the tubes on a magnetic stand for 5 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant.\nWash the beads with 200 µL of 80% ethanol.\n\tNOTE: 80% ethanol should be prepared fresh.\nRepeat step 7.4.\nRemove the ethanol completely.\nAir dry the samples for 10 min at RT.\nResuspend with 50 µL of elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0).\nRepeat the beads purification (steps 7.1.-7.9.) to further minimize primer contamination.\n8. DNA concentration and quality check\nMeasure the DNA concentration by using a nucleic acid quantification kit (Table of Materials).\nCheck the amplified DNA fragments by gel electrophoresis using SYBR Gold (0.5x TBE, 1.5% agarose gel) or an automated electrophoresis system (e.g., TapeStation, bioanalyzer).\n9. Sequencing\nPerform high-throughput sequencing using the amplified DNA samples12,13.\n\t​NOTE: Amplified DNA samples are ready for high-throughput sequencing. To retain nucleosomal DNA fragment information, paired-end sequencing is recommended over single-end sequencing. Both ends of the DNA fragments indicate where the transposase bind. For mapping open chromatin regions, 30 million reads/sample is typically sufficient.\n10. Data analysis\nData filtration based on base call quality: Set the minimum average base quality score to 20 (99% accuracy).",
    "Adapter trimming: Remove the adapter sequences using an appropriate tool.\n\tNOTE: The Trim Galore wrapper tool (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) was used to remove adapter sequences. For ATAC-seq libraries prepared by Illumina Tn5, the following sequence is used as an adapter sequence: CTGTCTCTTATACACATCT. The minimum sequence length to recognize adapter contamination is set to 5.\nGenome mapping: Map the reads to the appropriate genome with Bowtie using the following parameters \"-I 0 -X 2000 -m 1\"15. An example of mapping quality from MDA-MB-231 basal breast cancer cells is below:\n\tReads with at least one reported alignment: 52.79%\n\tReads that failed to align: 13.10%\n\tReads with alignments suppressed due to -m: 34.11%\nDeduplication: Mark the PCR duplicates by Picard tools16.\nGenerating a genome coverage file for data visualization: Convert the deduplicated paired-end reads to single-end read fragments. Genome coverage tracks are obtained using genomeCoverageBed from bedtools17.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
