    "All animal experiments were approved by the Ethical Committee on Animal Experimentation of the University Medical Center Utrecht (Utrecht, the Netherlands) and conform to the 'Guide for the care and use of laboratory animals'.\nNOTE: The protocol to perform a closed-chest balloon occlusion is not part of the current manuscript and is described in detail elsewhere5. In short, pigs (60 - 70 kg) are subjected to 75 min transluminal balloon occlusion of the midportion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD).\nBoth, three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3D-TEE) and pressure-volume (PV) loop measurements can be performed at baseline, short-term and long-term follow-up. Note that these measurements are considered unreliable in the first hours after myocardial infarction due to frequent arrhythmias in this phase. Infarct size (IS) and area-at-risk (AAR) measurements are preferably assessed at short-term follow-up (24 - 72 hr)15,16, since changes in microvasculature and secondary myocardial scar thinning culminate in less reliable results. Infarct size staining is performed using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (CAUTION, irritant), which is considered highly reproducible and relatively inexpensive. TTC is a white powder that colorlessly dissolves in saline. Upon contact with various dehydrogenases, it is converted to a brick red color. Thereby, it discriminates between viable (red) and dead myocardial tissue (white). For an overview on both invasive and non-invasive infarct size determination, readers are directed to a comprehensive review on this subject17.\nFigure 1 shows the timeline including anesthesia, surgical preparation and primary outcome measurements used in this study.\n1. Medication and Anesthesia\nEnsure that the animal does not eat or drink for at least 5 hours prior to the procedure. Pre-treatment, anesthesia and post-operative pain treatment protocols have been described in detail elsewhere5.",
    "In short, the day prior to surgery a buprenorfine patch (5 µg/hr) is applied to the skin that is active for seven days to limit post-operative pain. On the day of surgery, sedate pigs by intramuscular injection of 0.4 mg/kg midazolam, 10 mg/kg ketamine and 0.014 mg/kg atropine. Wait for approximately 10 - 15 min. Insert an 18 G cannula in one of the ear veins and administer 5 mg/kg sodium thiopental to induce anesthesia.\nIntubate the pig using an endotracheal tube (size 8.5 for pigs of 60 - 70 kg). If necessary, perform balloon-ventilation (frequency 12/min) and transport the pig to the operating theater.\nUpon arrival in the operation theater, start mechanical positive pressure ventilation with FiO2 0.50, 10 ml/kg tidal volume and a frequency of 12/min using continuous capnography recording.\nStart balanced anesthesia by continuous intravenous infusion of a combination of midazolam (0.5 mg/kg/hr), sufentanil (2.5 μg/kg/hr) and pancuronium (0.1 mg/kg/hr).\nConfirm anesthesia by testing the corneal reflex and monitoring the breathing pattern (e.g., spontaneous breathing in combination with mechanical ventilation indicates incomplete anesthesia). Use vet ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness while the animal is under anesthesia.\n2. 3D Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE)\nTo allow for heart rate monitoring and data acquisition, connect the animal to the 5 leads ECG on the echocardiography machine.\nPlace the animal in the right lateral position. Make sure the probe is straight and flexible at the tip by unlocking the operating piece.\nOpen the pig's mouth and carefully insert the echo probe in the esophagus. If necessary, use a laryngoscope for visualization. Be careful to avoid ending up in the normal anatomic pharyngeal pouch, resembling a Zenker's diverticulum18.",
    "Insert the probe for 50 - 60 cm (measure from the tip of the snout). Slowly rotate the probe and flex the head to a left anterolateral position to visualize the heart (Figure 2A - B). Make sure all walls are clearly visible.\nUse the \"3D full volume\" option on the display of the echocardiography machine to display two perpendicular images of the left ventricle as shown in Figure 2C - D. Then maximize the sector width that is being acquired by selecting \"FV Opt Volume\". Pause ventilation by temporarily switching off mechanical ventilation and press \"Acquire\" to obtain full volume measurements.\nAfter echo acquisition, make sure the tip is flexible by unlocking the operating piece. Then slowly remove the probe from the animal.\n\tNOTE: Do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nPerform offline analysis with validated software as described previously19.\n3. Admittance-based Pressure-volume Loop Acquisition\nPre-soak the sensing tips of the 7 F tetra-polar admittance catheter in 0.9% saline (room temperature to 37 °C) for a minimum of 20 min to ensure proper hydration and minimal baseline pressure drift during the experiment20.\nAdminister medication and anesthesia as described in section 1.\nPerform surgical preparation and obtain vascular access as described previously5.\n\t\nIn short, shave and clean the neck. Disinfect the surgical area with iodine 2% and cover the non-sterile parts of the pigs with sterile surgical drapes.\nMake a medial incision in the neck to expose the carotid artery and internal jugular vein. Insert an 8 F sheath into the carotid artery and a 9 F sheath into the jugular vein.",
    "Insert a Swan-Ganz (SG) catheter through the 9 F sheath in the jugular vein and wedge it in a small pulmonary artery by inflating the balloon at the tip of the catheter. After adequate placement in the peripheral part of the lung, deflate the balloon. Connect the SG to an external cardiac output device.\nAttach a 20 ml syringe containing 0.9% sterile saline to the injection port that connects to the lumen with the most proximal debouchment. Measure cardiac output by rapid infusion of 5 ml 0.9% saline (room temperature) and obtain heart rates to calculate stroke volume (SV). Repeat this procedure three times and calculate the average SV.\n\tNOTE: Cardiac output is (automatically) calculated using the Stewart-Hamilton thermodilution equation and is based on temperature changes in the pulmonary artery upon infusion of room temperature saline21.\nRemove the SG catheter. Insert an 8 F Fogarty catheter through the 9 F sheath in the jugular vein and position it in the inferior vena cava.\nCalibrate the pressure signal of the PV loop catheter using the \"Course\" and \"Fine\" button, while the tip remains in 0.9% saline. Then input the measured SV into the system.\nAdvance the PV loop catheter through the 8 F sheath in the carotid artery and center the tip in the left ventricle (LV) under fluoroscopy.\nSelect the largest adequately placed-segment by plotting the raw conductance signal against the pressure signal. Ensure that the pressure-conductance loops are of rectangle shape. Phase signal is expected to show a sinus trace with values between 3 and 5 degrees. Pause ventilation and perform a baseline scan to convert Conductance to Volume.",
    "Accept the baseline data by pressing \"Continue\" when the signals are stable (no arrhythmias), heart rate is equal to ECG or pressure derived heart rates and end-systolic (ES) / end-diastolic (ED) conductance are adequately sensed by the system20.\n\t\tNOTE: The latter can be verified by plotting the raw conductance signal against the pressure signal and comparing ES / ED conductance values derived from the baseline scan to real-time conductance. If any of the requirements above is not met, repeat the procedure.\nAcquire baseline pressure-volume loops by recording 10 - 12 consecutive beats during apnea by pausing ventilation.\nInflate the Fogarty catheter under fluoroscopic guidance to reduce preload and record 10 - 12 consecutive beats as described above. Make sure systolic blood pressure remains >60 mmHg and no arrhythmias interfere with the measurements.\nRemove the Fogarty and PV loop catheters. Keep recording arterial pressure before and during removal of the PV loop catheter to enable correcting for pressure drift (i.e., ex vivo pre- and post-procedural baseline pressure difference).\n\tNOTE: Do not leave the animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nPerform offline analysis of geometrical measurements and functional parameters with validated software22.\n4. Area At Risk (AAR) and Infarct Size (IS) Quantification\nDissolve 1.00 g Evans blue (CAUTION23, toxic) in 50 ml 0.9% saline, fill two 50 ml Luer lock syringes with 20 ml and 30 ml of 2% Evans blue solution respectively and keep at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Work in a fume hood and wear a dust mask to limit exposure to hazardous dusts and use gloves and protective glasses to prevent contact from skin and eyes.",
    "Taking similar precautions, dissolve 1% 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazoliumchloride (TTC) (CAUTION, irritant) in 37 °C 0.9% saline and keep at 37 °C.\nSurgically prepare the animal to obtain vascular access to both carotid arteries. Perform a sternotomy to allow for direct visualization of the effect of in vivo Evans blue infusion5.\nInsert a 7 F and an 8 F introducer sheath in the respective carotid artery. Alternatively, insert both introducer sheaths in one single carotid artery or use one of the femoral arteries for one of both guiding catheters.\nConnect two standard Y-connectors to a 7 F JL4 and an 8 F JL4 guiding catheter respectively. For a femoral approach, use a JR4 for the right coronary artery (RCA) and a JL4 for the left main coronary artery (LCMA). Connect an additional three-way tap with 10 cm extension to both Y-connectors.\nAdminister 100 IU/kg heparin. Position the 8 F JL4 guiding catheter in the ostium of the LMCA via one of two introducer sheaths.\nUsing a 0.014\" guidewire, advance a coronary dilatation catheter through the LCMA catheter and position the balloon at the site where coronary occlusion was performed during MI induction. Do not inflate yet.\nPosition the second 8 F JL4 guiding catheter in the ostium of the RCA via the second introducer sheath.\nPerform a coronary angiography (CAG) by infusing contrast agent under fluoroscopy to confirm correct positioning of both guiding catheters and the balloon in the coronary arteries, using anteroposterior and LAO 30° views.\nAttach the two 50 ml syringes containing 30 ml (LCMA) and 20 ml (RCA) 2% Evans blue to the respective three-way taps attached to the Y-connectors on the guiding catheters.",
    "Inflate the balloon and confirm occlusion of the coronary artery by CAG. Only when the balloon completely blocks the passage of any contrast agent, inject Evans blue dye through both guiding catheters (5 ml/s) while the balloon is inflated.\nDirectly after the completion of Evans blue infusion, induce ventricular fibrillation by placing a 9 V battery on the non-infarcted part of the heart.\nIncise the caval vein to release pressure and make sure a suction unit is available to allow for drainage of blood.\nDeflate the balloon, retract it together with both guiding catheters and explant the heart by dissecting surrounding membranes. A transverse cut through the large vessels (i.e., aorta, pulmonary artery/veins) allows for complete explantation. Rapidly wash off blood and superfluous dye on the exterior surface and in the cardiac cavities using 0.9% saline.\nCarefully dissect the left ventricle and make cuts in 5 equal 10 mm thick sections from apex to base, in a plane parallel to the atrioventricular (AV) groove.\nPhotograph both sides of all five slices separately under ambient light conditions, as a possible Evans blue washout may occur in the subsequent step. For calibration, make sure a ruler is present in the image.\nIncubate for 10 min in 1% TTC solution at 37 °C, turning the sections around after 5 min for equal staining.\nAgain, photograph both sides of all five slices separately under ambient light conditions and make sure a ruler is visualized in the image for calibration.",
    "Weigh all slices. Use software suitable for the analyses5. When using ImageJ (version 1.47), click the \"Straight line\" button. Now, draw a straight line with a known distance using the ruler in the image (e.g., 5 cm). Click \"Analyze\" -> \"Set scale\" and enter the distance in the box \"Known distance\". This procedure allows for calibration of distance in pixels to SI units of length.\nUsing the \"Polygon selections\"button, select the total area that corresponds to the LV myocardium in the present image, click \"Analyze\" -> \"Measure\" to acquire measurements. Perform this procedure for both sides of each slice of myocardium, and average per slice.\n\t\nMultiply by the weight of the slice proportional to the total weight of all five slices and average these measurements for all slices.\nPerform similar measurements for area at risk (AAR) and infarct size (IS). Divide IS/AAR, AAR/LV and IS/LV and multiply by 100% to obtain respective outcome measurements5.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
