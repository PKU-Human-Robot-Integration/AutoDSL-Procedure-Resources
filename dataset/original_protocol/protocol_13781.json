    "Written informed consent was obtained from each POR patient with diminishing ovarian reserve who enrolled in the drug-free IVA treatment. This study was approved by ethical committee of International University of Health and Welfare (No. 17-S-21). Clinical trial was registered under number UMIN000034464 and carried out in accordance with the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki).\n1. Ovarian cortex extraction\nRemove part of ovarian cortex (10 x 10 mm, 2-3 mm thickness) from one or both ovaries under general anesthesia through laparoscopic surgery as previous described19,20.\nPlace the collected ovarian cortexes in a sterile container containing 10 mL of modified HTF (mHTF) at 37 °C.\n2. Ovarian cortex fragmentation\nNOTE: Prior to dissection of the ovarian cortex, warm up mHTF to 37 °C. Maintain sterile conditions throughout the procedure. All tools for this procedure are listed in Table of Materials.\nPlace the collected ovarian cortexes in a plastic dish containing 5-10 mL of mHTF at 37 °C and place them on the heat plate to maintain the tissue at 37 °C (Figure 2A).\nTake a picture of each cortex using a digital camera with patient's name before starting next procedure to link patient background data.\nPlace an individual cortex on a sterile gauze moistened with mHTF (Figure 2B).\n\tNOTE: Apply additional mHTF with a disposable pipette on the gauze to prevent the surface of cortex being dried out during this procedure.\nRemove residual medulla tissue where looks pink using a micro-scissors so that thickness of tissue reaches 1-2 mm (Figure 2C and D).\n\tNOTE: To avoid the loss of follicles at early stage, do not prepare the cortical strips less than 1 mm in thickness, because the early-stage follicles are located within 1-2 mm from the surface of ovarian cortex21.",
    "Dissect a 1 mm x 1 mm x 5 mm of tissue piece from each ovarian cortical strip using a fine scalpel and subject it to histological analysis to determine the presence of residual follicles as previous described18 (Figure 2E).\n\tNOTE: The dissected tissues for histology are immersed in mHTF and keep at 4 °C until fixing (Figure 2F, see Step 4).\nCut the cortex into 1mm x 1 mm x 10 mm strips using a fine scalpel (Figure 2G).\n\tNOTE: It is easier to cut by pressing down on the scalpel than by pulling on it.\nCut these tissue strips into 1 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm small cubes (Figure 2H).\n\tNOTE: To avoid changes of osmotic pressure in the medium, add mHTF in moderation before tissue autografting.\n3. Auto-grafting of ovarian cortical fragments\nOpen the package of the IVA cannula and put it on a sterile drape.\nRinse inside of the IVA cannula with mHTF by aspirating and discharging mHTF several times.\nAspirate 100-200 µL of mHTF to fill the tip of IVA cannula to avoid the cortical cubes from drying out during loading (Figure 3A).\nLoad the cortical cubes into the tip of IVA cannula using a fine tweezer (Figure 3B-E).\n\tNOTE: The number of cortical cubes for loading depends on the grafting site. Generally, 20-30 cubes can be transplanted into an orthotropic remaining ovary, whereas 10-15 cubes can be transplanted into a pouch beneath the serosa of the Fallopian tube.\nAfter loading the cortical cubes, hold the tip of the cannula containing the cortical cubes by the fingers until transferring the IVA cannula to a surgeon. This will avoid the cube temperature to decreases.",
    "​NOTE: The details of autografting procedure under laparoscopic surgery have been reported previously19. For grafting ovarian cortical cubes, a cannula-shaped device (IVA cannula) was developed by our collaborator, the Kitazato Corporation.\n4. Histological analysis of ovarian cortex\nNOTE: To count the number of residual follicles, perform histological analysis as previous described15.\nMark the cortical strip surface with a tissue marking dye before sample fixation. This will indicate the side of cortex in strip for histology.\nFix the tissue strips overnight at 4 °C using Bouin's solution.\n\tNOTE: To detect atretic follicles, we do not recommend using paraformaldehyde for fixing to avoid shrinkage of oocyte cytoplasm.\nDehydrate and embed the tissue strips in paraffin.\nSerially section the paraffin block containing the tissue sample.\nStain each section using hematoxylin and eosin to visualize the follicles.\nCount the follicles as previously described17.\nSubscription Required.
