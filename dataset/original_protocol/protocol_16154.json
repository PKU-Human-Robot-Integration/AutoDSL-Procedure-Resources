    "The pharmacological manipulation of myogenic differentiation is an important tool for studying the mechanisms of differentiation. A variety of compounds have been reported to both positively and negatively influence differentiation kinetics in vitro (De Angelis et al., 1998[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0004]; McRae et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0017]; Montesano et al., 2013[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0019]; Pavlidou et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0021]; Zhao et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0035]). One such compound is metformin which may inhibit or enhance differentiation depending on the presented dose (Pavlidou et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0021]). Specifically, metformin acts to induce adenosine monophosphate (AMP) accumulation, which mimics an energy-deprived state, thereby inducing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and cellular autophagy (Viollet et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0031]). This has both myogenic enhancing and impairing effects. As reported in Pavlidou et al. (2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0021]) low concentrations of metformin have a slight myogenesis-promoting effect in the cell but are inhibitory at high concentrations. Here we demonstrate a methodology to assess the impacts of metformin across a range of concentrations on the differentiation of primary myoblasts isolated from the hind limb muscles of mice. Myogenic differentiation is assessed by immunostaining against myosin heavy chain (MYHC), a marker of terminal differentiation (Zammit, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0034]), followed by microscopy to obtain phase contrast and fluorescence images of the samples. Subsequently, the fusion index, a measure of differentiation efficiency, is obtained by calculating the number of fused nuclei in developed myotubes divided by the total number of nuclei (Simionescu-Bankston et al., 2015[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0026]). However, primary myoblast cell lines may exhibit distant differentiation capacities and kinetics, even if from the same genetic background. Therefore, prior to pharmacological treatment, an evaluation of the basal differentiation efficacy of the primary myoblast cell line is necessary to determine how to best implement a pharmacological dose-response curve.",
    "To achieve this, primary myoblasts are differentiated in the absence of the pharmacological agent over an extended time course in order to identify the optimal differentiation endpoint. Subsequently, using this established endpoint, a dose-response curve is performed to evaluate the impact of specific pharmacological agents on myogenic differentiation over a wide range of concentrations. The assessment of pharmacological modulation on the differentiation capacity in primary myoblast models provides insight into the therapeutic potential of these agents in enhancing muscle regeneration and treatment of myopathies.",

Culture myoblasts in GM on 35-mm dishes until they reach ∼95%-100% confluency. Subsequently, wash cells once with PBS. After washing, induce differentiation by replacing GM with DM for the desired differentiation period.",
    "Ensure even distribution of myoblasts on the dish to prevent cell clumping and premature differentiation. Medium changes during differentiation may impact the differentiation efficiency and therefore should be optimized for each cell line and treatment assay. It is also important to consider the impact of medium changes on pharmacological agent potency during differentiation. In the experiments presented in Figures 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-fig-0003], 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-fig-0002], 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-fig-0004], the DM was not changed during the differentiation experiments.\nDifferent myoblast cell lines exhibit varying differentiation capacities and kinetics. An optimal differentiation should result in myotubes that are mature and fully developed. Differentiation for excessive durations of time results in myotube death, while ending the differentiation experiment prematurely does not provide the opportunity for cells to properly differentiate. We recommend performing a differentiation time course to identify the optimal differentiation endpoint. A time course will also permit the selection of specific time points of interest, for instance a partially differentiated cell population and a fully differentiated cell population. To perform a differentiation time course, seed primary myoblast cells in one 35-mm collagen-coated dish for each time point (e.g., seed five 35-mm plates if examining days −2, 0, 2, 4, and 6 post-differentiation).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e8aa299d-09cc-485a-ad2c-f7eb622a84eb/cpz1565-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2",

Aspirate DM and wash samples twice with PBS.\n5. Fix samples by incubating each 35-mm dish with 750 µl of 4% PFA solution for 20 min at room temperature.\n6.

Block cells with 750 µl IF blocking solution for at least 1 hr.",
    "The blocking solution contains both BSA and serum from the secondary antibody's host animal to prevent non-specific interactions.\n9.

Aspirate primary antibody solution and wash three times for 10 min each in IF washing solution.\nThe primary antibody solution can be kept and stored at 4°C for reuse. However, the number of times the primary antibody solution can be reused is specific to each primary antibody and thus must be validated prior to reusing to ensure consistent results.\n11. Dilute the secondary antibody 1:1,000 in IF blocking solution and incubate cells in 250 µl of secondary antibody solution for 1 hr at room temperature in the dark to prevent photobleaching.\n12. Aspirate the secondary antibody solution and wash it three times for 10 min each time with IF washing solution, ensuring the samples are kept in the dark during the washes. Let dry 5 min at an angle, then remove any residual liquid from the corner of the dish.\n13. Add 1 drop of mounting medium. Place a cover slip onto the drop of mounting medium using tweezers, removing any remaining air bubbles by gently tapping on the cover slip. Let sit overnight to dry at room temperature in the dark.\nImage myotubes and determine nuclear fusion index\n14. Using an inverted fluorescent microscope, acquire images of the DAPI, MYHC, and phase contrast channels with the 10× and 20× objective magnification.\nImages presented in Figures 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-fig-0003], 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-fig-0002], 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-fig-0004] were taken with a 10× objective and fusion counts were determined from images taken with a 20× objective.",
    "15. To quantify the fusion index, we use FIJI software (Schindelin et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0024]). Open DAPI, MYHC, and brightfield images into FIJI and merge the channels (Image → Color → Merge Channel) to produce a single image. Then, open the Channels Tool (Image → Color → Channels Tool), enabling the individual and combined viewing of each channel.\n16. Open the cell counter tool (Plugins → Analyze → Cell counter) and click initialize to permit counting of the merged image. Count all nuclei (represented by DAPI staining) in the image within two categories: single nuclei that are unfused and nuclei within stained myotubes (represented by MYHC staining), which contain ≥2 nuclei (i.e., fused nuclei). The fusion index is then calculated using the following equation (Equation 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-disp-0001]): \n         \nformula:\n\\begin{equation} {\\rm{Fusion\\ index\\ }}\\left ( { {\\% }} \\right) \\;=\\; \\frac{{{\\rm{Number\\ of\\ fused\\ nuclei\\ }}}}{{{\\rm{Total\\ number\\ of\\ nuclei}}}} \\times {\\rm{\\ }}100 \\end{equation}\nTo facilitate the counting of nuclei in FIJI, label different nuclei as cell type 1 (unfused) or cell type 2 (fused) and the cell counter will automatically tally the marked nuclei.\nPerforming a dose-response curve to assess pharmacological modulation of differentiation\n17. Based on cell morphology and nuclear fusion index, select the desired differentiation time points as identified in steps 3-16 to assess the impact of a particular pharmacological agent on myogenesis. Repeat steps 3 and 4, with the purpose of seeding cells to perform a dose-response curve.",
    "The concentration range selected should induce a series of phenotypic changes, from no or minimal changes in myogenesis at lower concentrations to increasing changes as the dose elevates, eventually reaching cytotoxicity. Cells may be pre-treated prior to differentiation or contemporaneously treated at the time of changing to DM with the compound. A vehicle control should be included to rule out any impact from the compound solvent.\n18. Repeat steps 5-16 to assess pharmacological modulation of myogenic differentiation at the different concentrations of the compound.",
    "RT-qPCR is a simple method that can be used to evaluate changes in the transcriptional landscape. Myogenesis is controlled by dynamic and temporal expression of specific myogenic regulatory factors during distinct phases of the differentiation program. The dynamic expression of these myogenic proteins during differentiation are reflected at the level of transcription; in chronological order, Pax7, Myf5, MyoD, MyoG, and Myh2 are temporally expressed during myogenesis (Soleimani et al., 2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0027]; Zammit, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0034]). Thus, RT-qPCR can reveal changes in the levels of myogenic gene transcripts in samples during different stages of the differentiation process. To isolate RNA, Trizol allows for rapid cell lysis while protecting RNA from degradation (Meng & Feldman, 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0018]). Then, the Bio-Rad Aurum RNA Isolation kit provides a quick and clean method to isolate total RNA. This protocol combines both Trizol and the Bio-Rad Aurum Total RNA Mini Kit to obtain high quality RNA for analysis by RT-qPCR. Subsequently, complementary DNA (cDNA) is generated from RNA by reverse transcription. Lastly, the relative levels of transcripts across cDNA samples are assessed using qPCR. Methods outlined in this protocol are applicable for monitoring the expression of myogenic transcripts whose expression indicates different phases of differentiation and may be affected following treatment with a pharmacological agent. Here, we present gene expression analyses from primary myoblasts differentiated in the presence and absence of the pharmacological modulator metformin that have been collected at select time points (as described in the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-prot-0001]).\nMaterials\nMyoblast cells (see Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-prot-0001])\nInvitrogen Trizol Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no. 15596-026)\nAurum Total RNA Mini Kit (Bio-Rad, cat. no. 732-6820)\nChloroform, molecular biology grade (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

Determine the average threshold cycle (Ct) value for each gene between technical replicates within a given sample.\nThe standard deviation should be <0.5.

    "In this support protocol, we demonstrate the detection of myogenic protein expression using western blotting. In chronological order of expression during differentiation, these are: PAX7, MYF5, MYOD, MYOG, and MYHC (Seale et al., 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0025]; Zammit, 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0034]). Harvested cell populations are lysed to collect total protein extracts. Subsequently, lysates are resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a membrane, which undergoes immunoblotting to reveal protein expression. This analysis enables the tracking of protein expression changes that occur during differentiation, which serve as markers of distinct phases within the differentiation program. By comparing cells treated with pharmacological agents to control (vehicle treated) cells, the impact of pharmacological agents at discrete stages during the differentiation program can be determined. Here, we present the protein expression analyses of primary myoblasts differentiated in the presence and absence of metformin that have been collected at select time points (as described in the Basic Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-prot-0001]).\nMaterials\nCollagen solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-rec-0002])\nPrimary myoblasts (see Current Protocols article: Filippelli et al., 2021[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-bib-0006])\nSterile PBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-rec-0010])\nGrowth medium (GM; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-rec-0004])\nDifferentiation medium (DM; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-rec-0003])\nLysis buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-rec-0008])\nBradford reagent (Bio-Rad, cat. no. 5000006)\n4× Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad, cat. no. 1610747)\n100× phosphatase inhibitor (Nacalai, cat. no. 07575-51)\n100× protease inhibitor (Nacalai, cat. no. 25955-11)\n12% acrylamide gel (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-rec-0001])\nWestern blot protein ladder (Bio-Rad, cat. no. 1610374)\nPolyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF; Bio-Rad, cat. no. 1620-77)\nSemi-dry transfer buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-rec-0012])\nPonceau S solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-rec-0011])\nPolyoxyethylene-20 (Tween 20; Bio Basic, cat. no.

Lyse cells by resuspending the cell pellet in lysis buffer (typically 50 µl for a 100-mm plate and 30 µl for a 60-mm plate) containing 1× protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail and incubate on ice for 30 min.\nEnsure a homogenous lysis of the cell pellet by gently flicking the tube every 10 min.\n4. Centrifuge in a microcentrifuge at 15,000 × g at 4°C for 20 min.\n5. Perform a Bradford assay to assess protein concentrations and dilute lysates in sterile deionized water to obtain desired protein concentrations.\nFor the results presented in Figure 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-fig-0003], we loaded 20 µg of protein. However, the amount of protein to be loaded should be optimized across experiments.\n6. Add 4× Laemmli buffer to the lysates and denature samples at 95°C for 5 min.\nResolve proteins by SDS-PAGE",
    "7. Polymerize SDS-PAGE gels, with the final acrylamide concentration depending on the molecular weight of target proteins.\nWe have found that 12% acrylamide is applicable for all target proteins shown in this protocol.\n8. Place gel into the running buffer tank, then fill it with 1× running buffer diluted from the 10× running buffer stock. Load sample lysate into the acrylamide gel alongside a protein ladder.\n9. Run at 50 V until the dye front passes the stacking-resolving gel interface. Then increase voltage to 120 V until the dye front runs off.\n10. In a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc imaging system, use the stain free imaging protocol to image the total protein load on the acrylamide gel.\nTo generate the data shown in Figure 2D[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-fig-0003], the parameters of 45 s UV activation and 10 s exposure were used. Depending on the ladder used while running the SDS-PAGE, this exposure may saturate the image. Thus, optimization is required. Alternatively, one may leave an empty well between the ladder and cell lysate lanes when loading the gel.\n11. Saturate the Turbo blot cassette and stacking papers with transfer buffer and assemble within the cassette. Assembly order from bottom to top is: stacking papers, PVDF membrane, acrylamide gel, stacking papers. Remove air bubbles by gently rolling over the top set of stacking papers with a roller.\n12. Drain excess buffer and run the “Turbo” protocol, selecting the specific protocol most relevant for your transfer (mini or midi).\nImmunoblotting\n13. To confirm proper transfer of proteins to the PVDF membrane, remove membrane and stain with Ponceau S solution, then rinse thoroughly with distilled water.\nA transfer is considered proper if there is no smearing or bubbles in the Ponceau S stain at the molecular weight of the protein of interest.",

Incubate the PVDF membrane in the primary antibody solution overnight at 4°C with agitation. The primary antibody solution consists of the primary antibody diluted to its respective optimal concentration (as identified in Table 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.565#cpz1565-tbl-0007]) in 5% skim milk powder (w/v) in PBST.\nPrimary antibodies can be re-used multiple times and may be kept frozen at −20°C for long-term storage.
