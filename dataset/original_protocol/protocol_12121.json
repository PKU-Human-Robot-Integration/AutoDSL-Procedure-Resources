    "All work with human subjects requires Institutional Review Board approval and oversight. Methods reported here, when used in research, have been reviewed and approved by the Human Subjects Protection Program through the Rutgers Arts and Sciences Institutional Review Board (IRB).\n1. Preparation\nSchedule the baby for 1 hr of testing in a sound-attenuated and electrically-shielded chamber. The study protocol presented in this article that produced representative data includes 20 - 30 min of EEG testing.\nAllocate three people per testing session: one “primary tester”, one “net assistant” and one “entertainer”.\nFor high-density infant EEG recording, use at least a 64-channel net. For the representative data presented here, a 128-channel sensor net was used.\n2. Net Application\nSet up the following supplies in the recording chamber: Coban self-adherent wrap tape, measuring tape, marking pen, 2 towels, and pipettes. Calibrate sounds to testing level (e.g., dB SPL, HL, etc.).\nMake the electrolyte solution (distilled water, Potassium Chloride and baby shampoo) well before estimated family arrival time. To ensure that the net is not too cold on the baby’s head, warm 8 ounces of water to be added to the solution just before application.\nWhen the family arrives, obtain consent with IRB approved forms.\nIn the testing chamber, sit the infant on the caregiver’s lap, and have the entertainer begin to play with the infant. If it is the first visit, explain the net application procedure.\nMeasure the infant’s head circumference at the widest point of the head and choose the net size based on this measurement. To obtain the best fit, choose a smaller-sized net if the circumference is close to the minimum size for one age. Submerge the chosen net in the electrolyte solution.",
    "Measure nasion-to-inion and mark the scalp at ½ of the total measurement. Do the same for the ear-to-ear measurement. The final mark is Cz (vertex).\nRemove excess solution from the net by placing it on a dry towel. Have the net assistant invert the net and grasp the Cz electrode; holding the net so that the primary tester can position their fingers at the front of the net.\nFlip the net over and place the net on the infant head as the net assistant moves the chinstrap and colored front threads (connecting the nasion electrode and chinstrap) outside of the net.\nAdjust the net position on the infant’s head, placing Cz at the vertex scalp mark. Position/align each of the electrodes starting from the back and working toward the front, making sure that there is a right angle between each electrode and the head surface.\nCollect the wires, adjust the chinstrap, secure wires with Coban tape, and plug in the net connector.\nMeasure the electrode impedance with a threshold of < 50 KOhms, or according to system instructions. If some electrodes have high impedance, re-soak the electrode with an electrolyte-filled pipette and gently move the hair from beneath the electrode.\n3. Stimuli Presentation and EEG Recording\nPresent auditory stimuli in free-field with speakers equidistant from the infant’s head.\n\tNOTE: The representative study stimulus parameters were as follows: 70 msec tone-pairs with a fundamental frequency of either 800 or 1,200 Hz and 15 harmonics (6 dB roll-off per octave) are presented in two blocks (70 or 300 msec inter-stimulus interval). The low-high pairs (800 Hz - 1,200 Hz) are presented as deviants (15% = 125 trials) among low-low (800 Hz - 800 Hz) standards (85% = 708 trials).",
    "Record the EEG according to hardware and software instructions. Use the following parameters for the representative data: Sampling rate: 250 Hz, Low-pass Hardware filter: 100 Hz, Elliptical, High-pass filter: 0.1 Hz, Auto: set to Nyquist, Board gain: 1.\nProvide a calm, quiet, mildly engaging environment for the infant during recording. Engage the infant by playing an age-appropriate silent video or with quiet toys (e.g., blow bubbles, point to pictures in books, puppet play). Providing the caregiver with earphones to listen to music avoids inadvertent caregiver interference with the infant response. If the infant is restless, impacting the EEG, pause stimulus presentation and EEG recording until a calm environment can be restored.\nAfter the experiment is completed, gently remove the net and dry the infant’s hair and head.\nSave and backup the raw, unfiltered EEG data before closing the programs at the end of the testing session.\n4. Data Processing - ERPs\nVisually inspect the raw EEG data and reject segments with high-amplitude artifact.\nNOTE: Reject channels with high amplitude and interpolate. Maximum percent of rejected channels should be set at 30%. Alternative methods (e.g., ICA, PCA, see also reference 30) may be employed to reduce or reject artifacts present in the data.\nFilter the data with pre-established parameters that accord with cortical activity. For infants, use an off-line bandpass filter of 1 - 15 Hz.\nSegment the continuous data to create epochs around “Time 0” (stimulus onset) according to software instructions. For segmentation, include sufficient pre-stimulus time to establish baseline activity and post-stimulus time to capture the entire response.\nReject noisy epochs according to an appropriate rejection criteria (e.g., +/- 200 µV for infants). Set maximum percent of rejected epochs at 30%.",
    "Average the epochs for each individual and each condition and combine these averages according to group and condition for grand averages.\nIf the number of epochs contained within each average varies across subjects, weight the number of epochs so that subjects with more/less epochs are equally valued.\n\t\nTo weight the grand average, calculate the individual average from each condition as n times the waveform, where n equals the number of epochs that comprise the average, then divided by the total number of epochs for all subjects. This method gives each trial equal weight in the final average.\n5. Data Processing – Source Localization\nFor infant data, co-register each individual and grand average ERP file with either an age-appropriate MR template or an individual MR scan (refer to previous publications 31,32).\nNOTE: In the co-registration process, the electrode positions and reconstructed head are registered into a single coordinate system. Grand averages may be used to define the dipole model.\nEstimate the number and location of underlying sources to be fitted to the data. For an auditory paradigm, use two dipoles with free location and rotation.\nNOTE: Source estimation is then automatically guided through a minimization of a cost function that is a weighted combination of 4 residual fit criteria to obtain the “best fit” location to the time window of interest.\nMake sure age-appropriate parameters are used for scalp thickness, skull thickness, width of the subarachnoid space and bone conductivity as these factors change rapidly during development. For the representative data, parameters are: skull: 1.5 mm; scalp: 2.5 mm; subarachnoid space: 1.7 mm; bone conductivity: 0.0581.\nBeginning with a grand average ERP, choose a time window of interest corresponding to a peak. Conservative parameters are typically +/- 20 msec around the peak of interest 31.",
    "Check the “goodness of fit” for the dipole solution using the software outputs of residual variance. This is the amount of signal that remains unexplained on the given time window of fit by the current dipole model. Adjust the time window to minimize the residual variance. Use a distributed source model (CLARA) to check the solution within the extended activity region.\nSave the dipole-source solution and waveforms for each condition and peak.\nRepeat the procedure for every individual average file.\nFor statistical analysis of source location, use values of peak latency, amplitude, and location coordinates in the X (medial-lateral), Y (anterior-posterior), and Z (superior-inferior) directions for each dipole from each individual average file solution. In the case presented here, 2X2 Repeated measures ANOVA (Stimulus (standard, deviant) X Hemisphere (Left, Right) for the amplitude and latency of the sources can be useful to look at strength and timing of the generators. Source coordinates can be evaluated in the same way (for review, 31,32).\n6. Data Processing – Time-Frequency Analysis in Source Space\nApply the dipole model solution to the raw, unfiltered, continuous EEG data.\n\t\nApply the source solution (saved in step 5.6.) to the raw EEG data file as a virtual electrode montage.\n\t\tNOTE: The use of the dipole model in this way applies a fixed spatial filter onto the surface channel recording (sensor space) to transform the continuous high-density EEG into a virtual 2-source montage (brain source space).\nTransform the time-domain single-trial source signal into the time-frequency-domain (Figure 1).",
    "NOTE: Currently, several approaches can be utilized to transform single-trial data into the time-frequency domain, including wavelet analysis and application of a Hilbert transform to filtered data. While a comparison of these methods is outside the scope of this article, several published articles have thoroughly described these methods 33-36. The time-frequency analysis using the complex demodulation procedure found in a commercially available coherence software program 37, calculates the instantaneous envelope amplitude and phase of each brain activity as a function of frequency and time 37-39. This produces measures of instantaneous power shifts (Temporal Spectral Evolution, TSE) and phase-locking (Inter-trial Phase Locking, ITPL).\nUse the following parameters: 1 Hz wide frequency bins from 2 to 80 Hz and 50 msec time resolution from -1,500 to 1,500 msec. The epoch time window should be long enough to allow filtering or processing at the lowest desired frequency without incurring artifacts 40,41.\nVisualize the frequency peaks of activity in EEG in order to avoid interpretation of possible spurious artifact-related or circular related oscillations 41,42.\nPerform permutation testing and cluster analysis to determine regions of significant differences across conditions and groups 24,43."
