  "procedures": [
    "In the development of this model, three cadaveric heads were obtained through the Oregon Health & Science University Body Donation Program and handled per the Code of Ethics approved by the Oregon Health & Science University Institutional Review Board.\n1. Head Preparation\nObtain fresh cadaveric heads. Secure the head in the sink, resting on a block with the neck facing upwards.\nPrepare a 5 L 1:100 solution of anticoagulant citrate dextrose and warm water. Use the solution within 72 h.\nInsert a 5-mm arterial cannula into the right jugular vein (lateral to carotid) and apply an arterial cannula clamp around the vessel. Perfuse the vessel for 15 min with a perfusion pump and anticoagulant citrate dextrose solution to wash the vessel. Remove the cannula and repeat with the left jugular vein and carotid arteries bilaterally. Repeat with a 3-mm cannula on the vertebral arteries bilaterally.\nAllow the heads to sit and dry overnight. Position the heads with the face facing upwards and neck positioned at a 45 ° angle with a supporting block underneath. Then store in a cold room at 5 °C overnight.\nEmbed the heads in 2 L of embalming solution. Store heads in a bucket, submerged in 10% formalin fixative solution.\nUse the prepared heads with either silicone compound injections to train with static anatomy (step 2) or arterial injury and perfusion setup to train with dynamic anatomy (step 4).\n\t\nTo complete the silicone compound injections (step 2): complete step 2, then move to step 3 to complete the dissection.\nTo complete the arterial injury and perfusion setup (step 4): complete the step 3 dissection, then move to step 4 for perfusion instructions.\n2. Silicone Compound Injections",
    "Prepare the silicone compound solution according to the manufacturer's instructions (50 µL diluent, 40 µL red silicone compound dye, and 4.5 µL curative agent).\nUse dissection to identify the external carotid arteries. Clamp the right external carotid artery with a hemostat to focus the injection into the intracerebral vasculature.\nInsert the arterial cannula into the right internal carotid artery and apply the arterial cannula clamp around the vessel. Inject 20 µL of silicone compound solution. Stop the injection when the flow of the silicone compound solution is noted at the left common carotid artery.\nClamp the common carotid arteries bilaterally with hemostats.\nInsert an arterial cannula into the right vertebral artery and apply an arterial cannula clamp around the vessel. Inject 10 µL of silicone compound solution. Stop the injection when the flow of silicone compound solution is noted at the left vertebral artery.\nClamp the vertebral arteries bilaterally with hemostats.\nAllow the head to sit at room temperature for 30 min, then gently remove all clamps.\n3. Tissue Dissection\nPosition heads with the face upwards and the neck positioned at a 45° angle with a block positioned beneath it in order to visualize the nasal passages.\nObtain 0- and 30-degree endoscopes of 4 mm diameter and 18 cm length. Connect it to a fiber optic camera and a light source.\nPrepare all heads with both ETA and TOPA dissections.\nETA 14 :\n\tNOTE: See Figure 1A for representation of the ETA dissection.\n\t\nUse a speculum to move the middle turbinates laterally on bilateral sides.\nUse suction and a Penfield 1 dissector to identify the sphenoid ostium bilaterally.",
    "With an 11-blade knife, make an incision on the right side of the nasal septum at the articulation of the sphenoid rostrum and vomer to bone. Make the incision 1 cm below the cribriform plate and to the floor of the nasal cavity.\nDissect the mucoperiosteum from the bone using a Penfield 1 dissector.\nDisarticulate the sphenoid rostrum from the bony nasal septum with a Penfield 1 dissector and perform septectomy.\nUse a Kerrison 2 to cut the bone from the sphenoid ostia to the floor of the sphenoid sinus bilaterally.\nGrasp and remove the keel with a large pituitary rongeur to expose the sphenoid sinus, and remove mucosa.\nUse a trans sphenoidal drill to drill the remaining inferior rostrum of the sphenoid flush with the floor of the sphenoid sinus.\nIdentify the bony impressions of the cavernous carotid arteries, opticocarotid recess, sella, and clivus (Figure 2); drill the clivus to expose its dura.\nRetract the pituitary gland (which should be in clear view) and drill out the clivus using a 5-mm coarse diamond burr.\nRemove the posterior clinoid.\nDissect the lateral pituitary gland dura free from the pituitary gland; it is not necessary to dissect the dura over the pituitary gland.\n\t\tNOTE: If any inadvertent pituitary gland dura dissection occurs, it will not impact the function of the model.\nUse a Kerrison to remove bone fragments to expose the clival dura.\nExcise the clival dura to expose the basilar artery, anterior inferior cerebellar arteries (AICA), superior cerebellar arteries (SCA), and posterior cerebral arteries (PCA) (overview in Figure 3, anatomy detailed in Figure 4).\n\t\tNOTE: The clival dura may be retracted with a U-based flap and stabilized with a 2-0 silk suture.\nTOPA 14 :\n\t​Note: See Figure 1B for representation of the TOPA dissection.",
    "Move the caruncle laterally using forceps, then use scissors to make an incision medial to the caruncle where the conjunctiva meets the skin.\nUse iris scissors to widen the incision superiorly and inferiorly: the incision should continue behind the superior and inferior limbs of the medial canthal tendon; perform blunt dissection along the posterior limb of the medial canthal tendon to the posterior lacrimal crest.\nUse a Penfield 1 dissector to make an incision in the periosteum posterior to the lacrimal crest.\nLift the periosteum from the medial orbit wall; continue to lift the periosteum toward the orbit apex in the subperiosteal plane.\nIdentify and divide the anterior and posterior ethmoid arteries along the fronto-ethmoidal suture.\nInfracture the lamina papyracea between the ethmoid arteries and below the fronto-ethmoid suture with gradual pressure from a joker.\nUse a pituitary rongeur to remove bone in order to expose the sella, clivus, contralateral opticocarotid recess, and cavernous carotid arteries.\n4. Arterial Injury & Perfusion Setup\nPrepare arterial injury.\n\t\nUse an endoscope to visualize the anatomy of the posterior circulation (representation in Figure 3 and Figure 4).\nSelect the location for the desired bleeding. For possible locations for simulated aneurysm bleed see Figure 5. Make a 3-mm laceration in the desired artery.\nPerfusion setup & bleeding\n\t\nCannulate the common carotid artery and secure with a clamp. Connect the cannula to the perfusion pump.\nPrepare artificial blood with a 3:1 ratio of water to commercially purchased fake blood. Then add 2 drops of red coloring for every 250 mL of water.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepared artificial blood may be reused for multiple simulations. 3 L of blood is prepared for each cadaveric head prior to the start of the simulation. This can be stored at room temperature. Shake before use.",
    "Start the perfusion pump and measure the mean arterial pressure (MAP) delivered to the cadaver head via an arterial line transducer and vital signs monitor. Maintain MAPs within a range of 65-110 mmHg to produce realistic bleeding depending on the desired simulation scenario.\n5. Clip Placement in Simulation Training\nUse an aneurysm clip and clip applier for vessel clipping in this model (Figure 6).\nUse a clip applicator for clip placement (Video 1) at the simulated aneurysm sites of the posterior circulation (Figure 5).\nSubscription Required.
