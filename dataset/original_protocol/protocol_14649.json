    "The government of Middle Franconia in Bavaria, Germany, granted permission for the procedures described. Any similar experiments require prior authorization by the appropriate authorities.\nNote: The following manual can be used for previously discussed groups A through C. Steps that have to be left out in groups A and B are marked accordingly.\n1. Preparations\nPut on gloves, place the polystyrene pad underneath the microscope, and focus the lens on the area slightly above the pad.\nSplit the sterile sheet and place half over the polystyrene pad and the other half just next to it.\nSterilize the surgical instruments and place them on a sterile sheet next to the Polystyrene pad.\nUnbend a large paper clip to form an arch. Turn it upside down and press it into the polystyrene pad at the top end - just next to where the animal's head will lie.\nPlace the mouthpiece of the vaporizer between the two limbs of the arch. (Figure 7)\nSet up a heating lamp about 40 cm from the place where the animal's head will lie. Make sure the heat at the level of the polystyrene pad does not exceed 40 °C.\nPrepare a separate cage for operated animals.\nPrepare a defined quantity and volume (maximum of 50 µl) of tumor cells in a flex tube and store it on ice.\n2. Anesthesia\nPlace the mouse into a plexiglas box and begin anesthetic induction on high flow isoflurane (5% isoflurane at a flow of 10 L/min).\nAfter going through the different stages of anesthesia, remove the mouse from the plexiglas box just after it has entered the stage of agonal breathing, which can easily be recognized by a drastic decrease in respiratory rate (<20/min) and deep gasps shaking the animal's entire body.",
    "Quickly place the animal belly-up onto the sterile drape covered polystyrene pad and continue ventilation on low-flow isoflurane by inserting the mouse's snout into the mouthpiece to maintain anesthesia. Use an inspiratory fraction of 1.8-2.2% at a flow of about 1 L/min.\nEvaluate the depth of anesthesia during the operation by calculating the respiratory frequency, which is ideally between 45 and 60 breaths per min. Adapt the inspiratory isoflurane fraction accordingly if this is not the case.\n\tNote: Changes in the inspiratory isoflurane fraction take about 60 sec until they become effective. Avoid carrying out drastic changes rapidly. Instead, modify the anesthetic's application gradually.\n3. Operation\nDisinfect the chest and abdomen with an adequate disinfectant and change gloves afterwards.\nInject a weight-adapted volume of carprofen (5 mg/kg bodyweight) into the animal's thigh.\nGently pinch the abdominal skin with a forceps to test if the depth of anesthesia is adequate.\nPerform an incision along the median line from the xiphoid to the mid-abdomen using scissors and forceps.\nCarefully dissect the area around the xiphoid to expose it from the surrounding tissue.\nPlace a stay suture through the xiphoid (from inside to outside) and attach both threads to the retainer above the animals head using the clamp.\nPinch the retractor's limbs together and slowly introduce the \"U\"-shaped retractor tips along the animal's internal abdominal wall.\n\tNote: These measures expose the liver to facilitate access to the different lobes. The identification of the liver's median and left lateral lobe should now be possible.\nUse a saline-soaked cotton swab and gently push the median lobe downwards. Dissect the ventral three quarters of the falciform ligament, which will now be visible between the median lobe's surface and the diaphragm.",
    "Now, use two saline-soaked cotton swabs to shift the median lobe and left lateral lobe upwards against the diaphragm.\nVisualize the thin membrane between the left lateral lobe and the caudate lobe and carefully dissect it.\n\tNote: When performing this protocol on animals from group A, jump to step 3.18 at this point.\nPlace a size 4-0 ligature diagonally along the left lateral lobe's base.\nNext, use the cotton swab to return the left lateral lobe to its original position.\nCarefully tie the ligature as close to the lobe's base as possible and assess for color change in the lobe to test for adequately interrupted blood supply.\nResect the left lateral lobe by following the line of the lobe's base and note the resected lobe's weight.\n\tNote: When performing this protocol on animals from group B, jump to step 3.18 at this point.\nPlace a second ligature between the left lateral lobe's stump and the median lobe's base.\nReposition the median lobe as well and tie the ligature. Again, assess for color change in the lobe to test for adequately interrupted blood supply.\nResect the median lobe and note its weight.\nConnect the 1 ml syringe to the 30 G needle and fill it with the tumor cells from the flex tube without tilting the syringe at any time.\nUse the cotton swabs to move the intestinal loops to the animal's left in order to expose the inferior right lobe.\nInsert the cell-loaded syringe into the \"third-hand\" device at a 30° angle to the vertical.\nCarefully move the device next to the mouse with the needle just above the inferior right lobe.\nSlowly advance the syringe within the third hand device until the needle's tip is in the inferior right lobe's center part.",
    "Inject the entire volume into the lobe's center part over a period of 30-45 sec.\nCompress the injection site for at least three minutes until bleeding has stopped.\nRemove the stay suture and the retractor.\nClose the fascia with a resorbable 5-0 suture using single button knots.\nClose the skin with a 4-0, non-resorbable suture using single button knots.\nStart ventilating the mouse on high flow oxygen for about 1 min.\n4. Post-op procedure\nPlace the animal into a warm environment (approximately 40 °C) for the next half hour to ensure adequate recovery.\nAdmix the animal's drinking water with 5 mg/ml of metamizole for 72 hr postoperative.\nExamine the integrity of the sutures closely for at least three days after the procedure.\n5. Observation Period and Euthanasia\nMeasure the animal's weight daily for a total of 14 days. Score them regarding their well-being and limitations respectively.\nAfter 14 days, anesthetize the animal following steps 2.1 and 2.2 of the operative protocol and proceed with institution's protocol for animal euthanasia.\nPerform a median laparotomy as explained in step 3.4. To facilitate access to the abdomen, extend the incision 1-1.5 cm caudally. Insert the retractor as pointed out in 3.7.\nDissect along the rest of the falciform ligament and cut the inferior vena cava just as it exits the liver cranially.\nSeparate the liver from the diaphragm, by grabbing the diaphragm with the forceps and bluntly dissecting into the space between liver and muscle tissue.\nLift the mobilized liver tissue off the retroperitoneum and dissect it off the remaining structures it is still attached to: retroperitoneal fatty tissue, the inferior vena cava and the portal vein.",
    "Inspect the liver after extraction for any additional tissue, which would falsely contribute to its actual size and weight. An extracted liver and its tumor are displayed in Figure 6.\nDissect the tumor off the inferior right lobe.\nMeasure the size and weight of both the tumor and the liver parenchyma.\nConserve additional tissue samples from the peritoneum, lymph nodes or other organs as needed for tissue analysis\nSubscription Required.
