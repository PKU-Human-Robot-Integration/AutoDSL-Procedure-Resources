    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGeneration of MHC immunoaffinity column\nTiming: 3 h\nThe following steps describe the preparation of an immunoaffinity column for MHC class I pull-down.\nNote: Wash the glass column with 1% TFA before packing the column for the first time to ensure no contamination from the glass column comes into the antibody-Sepharose column or in pre-column packed with Sepharose beads only.\nTransfer the required amount of protein A Sepharose to a 15 mL Falcon tube and wash the beads three times with 10 mL PBS.\nNote: Conjugate 10–20 mg of W6/32 antibody per mL of protein A Sepharose beads.\nDilute the antibody solution to a concentration of 0.5–2 mg/mL in PBS.\nRetain an aliquot of 5 μL of antibody solution and label it as pre-mAb.\nAdd antibody to protein A Sepharose beads. Rotate gently end-over-end at 20°C–25°C for 1 h to allow binding.\nTransfer the antibody-bound Sepharose beads to a glass column.\nCollect the flow through in a fresh tube.\nRetain 5 μL of this flow through and label as post-mAb.\nWash antibody-bound Sepharose beads with 10 c.v. of borate wash buffer at 20°C–25°C.\nWash antibody-bound Sepharose beads with 10 c.v. of 0.2 M triethanolamine, pH 8.2, at 20°C–25°C.\nAdd 4–5 c.v. of freshly prepared 40 mM DMP cross-linker to the column and let it pass through until only a small meniscus is left at the top of the Sepharose beads. Allow the reaction to proceed at 20°C–25°C for 1 h.\nWash the antibody-bound Sepharose beads with 10 c.v. of ice-cold 0.2 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the antibody-bound Sepharose beads with 10 c.v. of 0.1 M citrate buffer, pH 3. at 20°C–25°C.\nWash the antibody-bound Sepharose beads with 10 c.v. of PBS, at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Run an SDS-PAGE for the samples aliquoted at steps 2 and 5. Both the heavy chain and light chain bands should be present in the pre-mAb sample and absent in post-mAb.\nTroubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]\nCritical: Maintaining the pH of triethanolamine at 8.2 is important.\nPause Point: The antibody column can be stored at 4°C for 2–3 months in the presence of 0.02% sodium azide/PBS\nPreparation of Sepharose protein A column for pre-clearing of cell lysate\nTiming: 3 h\nThis section describes the steps to make a column for pre-clearing the lysate before IP.\nTransfer 1 mL protein A Sepharose beads to glass column.\nWash the column with 10 c.v. of PBS.\nNote: The pre-column can be used 10 times or till the column gets blocked.\nPause Point: This column can be stored at 4°C for 2–3 months in the presence of 0.02% sodium azide/PBS.\nPreparation of cell lysate\nTiming: 3 h\nThis section describes steps involved in preparation of cell lysate.\nAdd 2 mL cell lysis buffer (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) for 100 M cells and let it thaw on ice.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_517_1.csv\nHomogenize the sample using 18G × 38mm needle. Repeat this 4–5 times in 15 min intervals.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 2,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to a fresh tube and centrifuge it at 20,000 × g for 60 min at 4°C.\nPass the supernatant obtained in step 18 through a 0.45 μm filter to remove any debris and aliquot 30 μg equivalent cell lysate in a microcentrifuge tube and label it as pre-IP.\nNote: Lysis of cells should be performed at 4°C. Do not store the cell lysate for more than 12 h as proteins tend to aggregate. Best practice is to lyse the cells and immediately carry out immunoprecipitation",
    "Optional: Combine the pellets obtained in steps 17 and 18. Add 2% SDS/50 mM TEABC, pH 8.0 to lyse the membrane bound organelles obtained. Sonicate and centrifuge it at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Perform western blot on the lysate obtained after adding 2% SDS/50 mM TEABC and at step 19, using anti-MHC class I antibody. MHC class I band corresponding to 40 kDa should be in the lysate from step 19 while it should be absent in the cell lysate obtained with SDS.\nImmunoprecipitation of MHC class-I complex\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis section describes steps for carrying out immunoprecipitation of MHC class I complex from cell lysate\nNote: Same approach can be used for carrying out immunoprecipitation of MHC class I complex from tissue lysate\nPass 10 c.v. of PBS through protein A Sepharose pre-column to remove sodium azide.\nPass cell lysate obtained in step 19 through the pre-column.\nCollect flow through in a fresh tube.\nPass 10 c.v. of PBS through the antibody column to remove sodium azide.\nPass 5 c.v. of cell lysis buffer (without detergent) through the antibody column.\nPass the pre-cleared cell lysate obtained in step 22 through the antibody column and collect flow through in a fresh tube.\nPass flow through obtained in step 25 through the antibody column.\nCollect flow through in a fresh tube.\nAliquot 30 μg of flow through to a microcentrifuge tube and label it as post-IP.\nWash antibody column with 10 c.v. of cell lysis buffer (without detergent).\nWash antibody column with 10 c.v. of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl.\nWash antibody column with 10 c.v. of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 450 mM NaCl.\nWash antibody column with 10 c.v. of 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, and 150 mM NaCl.",

The pH of liquid flowing out from the column should be more than 7.\nPool all fractions collected in step 32.\nTroubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nPause Point: The samples can be stored for a couple of days without much loss.\nNote: Clear the protein from pre-column by washing the column with 5 c.v. of 10% acetic acid and regenerate by passing 10 c.v. of 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 followed by 10 c.v. of PBS. The pH of liquid flowing out from the column should be more than 7. If reusing pre-column, ensure no protein is left on the column by running later fractions of acid wash on SDS-PAGE. Flow through can be run on SDS-PAGE to ensure no protein is bound to pre-column to avoid cross contamination.\nOptional: Perform western blot for the samples labeled pre- and post-IP using anti-HLA-A/B/C antibody. 40 kDa band should be detectable in pre-IP sample and absent in post-IP sample\nPurification of peptides from MHC- class I complex by reverse phase liquid chromatography\nTiming: 1–3 h\nThis section describes the steps and parameters for purifying peptides from MHC complex.\nSet the flow rate of HPLC system to 2 mL/min (Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_517_2.csv\nEquilibrate the column with 2% Solvent B.\nAdd trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to the sample obtained at step 33 such that the final concentration of TFA is 1%.\nTransfer the eluate to auto sampler vial.\nResolve peptides using the following LC gradient:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_517_3.csv\nCollect 500 μL fractions in micro centrifuge tubes.",
