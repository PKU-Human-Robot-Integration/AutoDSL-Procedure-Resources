    "The experiment has been approved by the ethics commission of the Hamburg medical association (PV4509).\n1. Participant Selection\nBeyond standard selection criteria, such as fitness for pain stimulation, head implants or pre-existing neurological conditions, make sure the participants are not suffering from acute or chronic pain, are not taking any pain medication, and have no known history of substance abuse. Participants should also not have taken part in any pharmacological studies during the 4 weeks prior to the experiment.\nInclude participants of any gender, yet take care to only include female participants that are using hormonal contraceptives13,14 to minimize the effect of cyclic changes in pain perception.\nBefore administering any kind of stimulation, make sure participants have given informed consent in writing.\n2. EEG Setup\nSelect an appropriate cap size and prepare the EEG electrode setup as per the system's instruction manual.\nSet the sample rate and high/low cutoff as well as the impedance limits of the recording equipment (recommended: 500 Hz, 0.5 Hz high-pass filter, impedances <20 kΩ).\nMake sure the stimulation device and the EEG device are not electrically coupled by running the EEG system on battery.\nEnsure that any link between the EEG system and the computer controlling the electrical stimulation device is potential-free.\n3. Electrical Stimulation Setup\nTo best make use of the time resolution of the EEG recording, keep the electrical stimulation as short as possible. Set the stimulator to a single, monophasic stimulation pulse with 1 ms duration and 400 V maximum voltage. If a more intense pain level is needed, or the exact timing of the post-stimulus EEG recording does not take precedence, other stimulation protocols can be used.",
    "Make sure the electrical stimulator is switched on but the output to the electrode is switched off. For the DS7A stimulator the switch labeled 'OUTPUT' to the right of the device should be in the down position.\nLocate the landmark(s) that identify the chosen stimulation site. For a stimulation at the hand, use the muscle between thumb and index finger (abductor/flexor pollicis brevis). Ask the participant to lay their hand on a flat surface with all digits stretched out and apposed. Identify the stimulation site by bisecting the distance between the first knuckles of the thumb and index finger.\nClean the skin by applying electrode preparation gel. Make sure not to use alcohol or disinfectant, which might leave residue on the skin that can lead to irritation or unreliable stimulation.\nAttach the stimulation electrode and fasten it in place with textile tape.\nAsk the participant to find a comfortable position for the hand and to try not to move the hand during the experiment, if possible. For the participant's convenience, place a soft tissue under the hand to absorb any humidity, depending on the surface permeability.\nEnable the stimulator's output by switching the 'OUTPUT' switch to the upward position.\n4. Determine Starting Points\nInstruct the participant on how to operate the rating scale on the screen using the mouse. The left half represents non-painful sensations; the right half corresponds to a standard pain VAS scale, providing a visual equivalent for a range of continuous sensation intensities in the form of a horizontal line. Point out to the participant that the absolute center point of the scale cannot be selected. Provide the participant with the standardized instructions about the anchor points15 (Table 1).",
    "Give the participant the opportunity to get comfortable with the rating process by applying stimuli of varying intensity and recording the responses. Use the information gathered during this phase to get an estimate for two intensities that consistently evoke strong but nonpainful sensations (low-point) and moderately painful sensations (high-point), respectively. Continue the stimulation for about 25 - 30 trials or until satisfied with having reached good estimates. During this time, it can be beneficial to query the participant for verbal feedback on the intensities and the subjective similarity of repeatedly presented stimulus intensities.\nTry to pick the intensities randomly to evoke responses around the scale center. For best results, do not simply increase or decrease the intensities linearly, and also explore the more extreme ends of the painful side. This phase should also give the participant the opportunity to get accustomed to the potentially unfamiliar stimulation and establish some reference for a consistent rating range. Because of this, it is advisable to apply intensities from the whole range of possible stimulus intensities, while also repeating some intensities.\nOnce satisfied with having obtained estimates for both a high-point and low-point starting intensity, inform the participant that the first part of the experiment is about to start and (s)he should keep on rating as practiced while random stimulus intensities are presented.\n5. Determine Threshold",
    "NOTE: The QUEST algorithm requires some parameters to be specified before starting estimation. Those parameters include the steepness of the psychophysical function (beta, typically 3.5), the fraction of trials where a random answer is expected (delta, typically 0.01), and the fraction of trials where a positive response is expected even though no stimulation is given (gamma, no recommendation). For Bayesian estimation, the range (SD) of the expected ratings and the spacing of possible responses (grain) must be specified. For a VAS, grain should be set to the resolution of the scale (typically 1), and the SD should be set large enough to include both the scale zero point and the maximum possible intensity plus some safety margin. The recommendations and \"typical\" values given here are explained in detail in the QuestCreate source code included with PsychToolbox6,16. For pain at the threshold, a gamma value of at most 0.01 should be plausible. The estimation method is relatively robust in terms of misspecification of the parameters, however for settings with only few trials, failure to specify sensible parameters might increase the uncertainty of the final estimate. If the standard deviation is set too low, the procedure will have problems converging on estimates that lie outside the area spanned by the standard deviation around the prior guess for the parameter. Thus it is important to rather err on the side of a too large standard deviation.\nCreate two QUEST sessions with the parameters given above. Start one from the high-point intensity and one from the low-point. Information about the implementation logic of the estimation process can be found in the supplemental material (S1).\nRandomly select a probe intensity of one of the two runs given by the respective QuestMean function.",
    "Set the electrical stimulator to the probe intensity. If a different intensity than the one suggested by the algorithm needs to be applied or the suggested intensity is out of range, feed the presented intensity back into the QuestUpdate function in step 5.5.\nTrigger the stimulus.\nAfter the participant has rated the stimulus, run QuestUpdate for the respective estimation session and supply it with the actual stimulus intensity presented as well as the participant's rating.\nContinue running rating trials until the estimates are stable or a predefined stopping criterion (>40 trials) has been reached.\nRecord the mean threshold estimate between both estimation runs, starting from the high and low starting point as given by QuestMean.\nAllow the participant to take a break at this stage, if desired.\n6. Stimulate at Threshold Level\nNote: It is possible to adjust the rating and block count to your needs as long as it is tolerable to the participant.\nInform the participant that for the remaining part of the experiment, more blocks with random stimulation will be following and they should keep rating as they did before. If needed, refresh the instruction on the scale anchor points.\nStart the EEG recording.\nSet the electrical stimulator to the mean threshold estimate obtained in step 5.7 and keep the setting constant throughout the rest of the experiment.\nStart a rating block (30 trials) and observe the data quality of the EEG recording. Depending on the EEG data quality, run 4 - 5 rating blocks and allow the participant to take short breaks in between the blocks.\n\tNOTE: Try to keep social interaction with the participant to a minimum during these breaks or standardize the interaction as much as possible.",
    "When finished, stop the EEG recording, switch the stimulator output to off, and remove the electrode. Debrief the participant after removing the EEG cap.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
