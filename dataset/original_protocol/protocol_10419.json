    "1. Preparation of the Capillary Microreactor\nCut the 100 µm internal diameter (ID) x 360 µm outer diameter (OD) capillary to a length of 7-8 cm, and the 20 µm ID x 90 µm OD capillary to 3-5 cm with the glass capillary cleaver; verify under the microscope that both capillary ends have a clean, straight cut, without any protruding burrs.\nInsert the 20 µm ID x 90 µm OD capillary into one end of the 100 µm ID x 360 µm OD capillary, for a length of ~6 mm; in case of need, observe this operation under a microscope.\nApply a small droplet of glue E6000 around the junction of the 90 µm OD/100 µm ID capillaries with the end of a Q-tip, and let the glue cure O/N at RT.\nCut the inserted 20 µm ID x 90 µm OD capillary to a length of ~10-15 mm; this will be the electrospray ionization emitter.\nPre-cut the 1/32\" OD PEEK, 1/16\" OD PEEK and 1/16\" OD PTFE tubing in pieces of 4-5 cm in length; these will be the sleeves used in capillary unions for providing a leak-free connection.\nConnect the opposite end of the 100 µm ID x 360 µm OD capillary to a PEEK union; use a 1/32\" PEEK sleeve for providing a leak-free connection.\nInsert/tighten a piece of ~5 cm long 1/16\" PTFE tubing into the opposite end of the union.\nWeigh ~4 mg of C18 (5 µm) particles in a pre-cleaned/dried 2 ml glass vial; add 0.5 ml isopropanol, close the vial and disperse the slurry in the ultrasonicator bath.",
    "Withdraw with a 250 µl syringe approximately 200 µl slurry, insert the syringe needle in the 1/16\" PTFE tubing of the PEEK union, and dispense slowly the slurry into the 100 µm ID x 360 µm OD capillary; observe under the microscope as the capillary fills with particles until a length of 2-3 mm packing is achieved; this will be the microreactor (Figure 1). The 20 µm ID capillary retains the particles in the microreactor through a Keystone effect.15\nRinse the microreactor with ~50 µl solution of H2O/CH3CN 50:50 v/v, and then with ~50 µl solution of H2O/CH3CN 98:2 v/v.\n2. Preparation of Sample Solutions\nNote: Operations that involve handling of organic solvents and acids and solution preparation are to be performed in a fume hood. Wear goggles, gloves and protective clothing.\nRinse with CH3OH and dry a few glass vials (4 ml) and polypropylene tubes (15 ml).\nPrepare 10 ml of a solution of H2O/CH3CN (98:2 v/v) in a 15 ml polypropylene tube by mixing 9.8 ml H2O with 200 µl CH3CN; mix by sonication.\nPrepare 10 ml of a solution of H2O/CH3CN (50:50 v/v) in a 15 ml polypropylene tube by mixing 5 ml H2O with 5 ml CH3CN; mix by sonication.\nPrepare 4 ml of an acidified aqueous solution (TFA 0.01% v/v) by adding 4 µl TFA(10%) to 4 ml H2O/CH3CN (98:2 v/v) in a 4 ml glass vial; mix by sonication.\nPrepare 4 ml of an acidified organic solution (TFA 0.01% v/v) by adding 4 µl TFA(10%) to 4 ml H2O/CH3CN (50:50 v/v) in a 4 ml glass vial; mix by sonication.",
    "Weigh 16 mg NH4HCO3 with an analytical microbalance in a 4 ml glass vial; add 4 ml of the H2O/CH3CN (98:2 v/v) solution and disperse by sonication; this results in a 50 mM solution of NH4HCO3 (pH~7.8) in aqueous buffer.\nWeigh 5 mg of a standard protein (e.g., bovine serum albumin, hemoglobin α/β, cytochrome C, carbonic anhydrase, α-2-HS-glycoprotein, etc.) with an analytical microbalance in a 4 ml glass vial; add 4 ml DI water and disperse by sonication; this typically results in a high µM-level concentration solution.\nPrepare 1 ml protein solution (1-2 µM) by diluting the high µM-level concentration solution with an appropriate volume of NH4HCO3 (50 mM) aqueous buffer; mix by sonication.\nPrepare the trypsin solution (5 µM) by dissolving 20 µg sequencing-grade trypsin in 170 µl NH4HCO3 (50 mM) aqueous buffer; disperse by sonication.\n3. Experimental Setup \nNote: The LTQ-MS system is fitted with a modified ESI source that includes a home-built XYZ-stage which enables interfacing of the mass spectrometer to various sample input approaches.\nDisconnect the capillary microreactor from the PEEK union and connect to the PEEK Tee.\nInsert a ~2 cm long Pt wire in the side-arm of the PEEK Tee; use a 1/32\" PEEK sleeve for providing a leak-free connection and for insulating the Pt wire.\nConnect a 50 µm ID x 360 µm OD (~0.5 m long) sample transfer capillary to the opposite end of the PEEK Tee; use a 1/32\" PEEK sleeve for providing a leak-free connection.\nSecure the PEEK Tee on the XYZ-stage and position the ESI emitter ~2 mm away from the mass spectrometer inlet capillary.\nConnect the Pt wire to the ESI power supply source of the mass spectrometer.",
    "Connect the opposite end of the sample transfer capillary to the stainless steel union; use a 1/16\" PEEK sleeve for providing a leak-free connection.\nConnect a 4-5 cm long 1/16\" PTFE tubing to the opposite end of the stainless steel union and insert the 250 µl syringe needle in the PTFE tubing; turn on the pump and set the flow rate at the desired value (e.g., 2 µl/min).\nInput tandem MS data acquisition parameters into the software package that controls the MS instrument and save as a method file to ready the setup for performing the analysis; for the LTQ-MS system, use the following data dependent analysis parameters: dynamic exclusion enabled for 180 sec with exclusion mass width ±1.5 m/z; one MS scan followed by one zoom and MS2 scans on the top 5 most intense peaks, zoom scan width ±5 m/z; collision induced dissociation (CID) parameters set at isolation width 3 m/z, normalized collision energy 35%, activation Q 0.25, and activation time 30 msec.\n4. Microfluidic Setup \nPrepare a microfluidic device from glass or polymeric substrates;16-18 the layout of the device is provided in Figure 2A, consisting of a microreactor (1) (0.13 mm width x 2 mm length x 50 µm deep) connected to an inlet (2), outlet (3) and a side port (4); the interconnecting channels for fluidic manipulations are ~110 µm wide and ~50 µm deep; a multichannel structure (5), consisting of ~1.5-2 µm deep x 10 μm wide x 100 μm long microchannels placed 25 µm apart, will act as a filter for retaining the particles in the microreactor.\nEnable fluid-delivery connections to the chip by gluing specialized connectors to the inlet ports, or by devising a polymeric stand that accommodates fittings for fluid delivery (Figure 2B).16",
    "Prepare a slurry of C18 particles (5 µm) as described in step 1.8; deliver the slurry to the microreactor with a syringe by using 1/16\" PTFE tubing connected to the chip side port (4); seal the port after particle loading with epoxy glue and cure for 1 hr in an oven at 90 ºC.16\nInsert a capillary (20 µm ID x 90 µm OD x 10 mm length) in the outlet port, seal with E6000 glue, and let cure O/N; this will become the ESI emitter (6).\nConnect a 50 µm ID x 360 µm OD (~0.5 m long) sample transfer capillary to the chip inlet port (2); connect the opposite end of the capillary to a 250 µl syringe and the syringe pump, as described in 3.6-3.7.\nPlace a light-weight PEEK Tee connector on the sample transfer line just prior to the inlet port (2) and insert a Pt wire on the side-arm of the Tee, as described in 3.2; this will be the ESI electrode.\nSecure the microfluidic device on the XYZ stage with the ESI emitter positioned ~2 mm away from the mass spectrometer inlet capillary; prepare the MS for analysis as described in 3.8.\n5. Sample Loading, Proteolytic Digestion and Elution for MS Analysis\nNote: All solution/sample transfer steps are performed with the aid of a syringe pump and should allow for a few additional minutes to complete, to compensate for the dead-volumes associated with the transfer lines to and from the microreactor; the necessary time will depend on the flow rates involved.\nRinse the microreactor and prepare it for analysis by infusing an aqueous solution of NH4HCO3 (50 mM) in H2O/CH3CN (98:2 v/v) at 2 µl/min for 5 min; use a 250 µl syringe.",
    "Load the protein sample (1 µM) on the microreactor by infusing the sample solution at 2 µl/min for 5 min; use a 250 µl syringe.\nInfuse the trypsin solution (5 µM) over the adsorbed protein on the microreactor at 2 µl/min for 1-3 min.\nQuench the proteolytic digestion process by rinsing the microreactor with an acidified aqueous solution of TFA (0.01% v/v) in H2O/CH3CN (98:2 v/v) at 2 µl/min for 5 min; use a 250 µl syringe.\nStart eluting the protein digest from the microreactor by infusing an acidified organic solution of TFA (0.01% v/v) in H2O/CH3CN (50:50 v/v) at 300 nl/min.\nTurn on the MS data acquisition process and the ESI voltage (~2,000 V); acquire MS data using the data acquisition parameters provided in step 3.8; observe the elution of the tryptic peptides.\n6. Data Processing\nProcess the tandem MS data with a search engine compatible with the raw MS data format.\n\t\nProcess the LTQ-MS raw files using an organism specific minimally redundant protein database; upload the raw data in the search engine, set the parent and fragment ion mass tolerances to 2 and 1 Da, respectively, and use only fully tryptic fragments with up to two missed cleavages for the search; do not allow for posttranslational modifications; set the high and medium-confidence false discovery rates (FDR) to 1% and 3%, respectively, and do not allow for posttranslational modifications.\nFilter the data to select only high-confidence peptide matches to the proteins in the database; evaluate the protein and peptide-level results.\nSubscription Required.
