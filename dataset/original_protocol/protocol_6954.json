    "Check whether the protocols are relevant to the pET plasmid of interest by cross-referencing Tables 1 and 2. If so, order the required oligonucleotide set.Protocol 1 will correct a design flaw in the T7lac module, converting it to T7pCONSlac. This protocol only applies to the pET plasmids listed in Table 1.Protocol 2 will replace the standard TIR with one of two optimised TIRs. This protocol only applies to pET expression plasmids encoding an N-terminal poly-histidine tag, such as those listed in Table 1.Table 1. pET plasmids that will benefit from each protocolimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210816/20210816192635_1327.png Order the oligonucleotide sets required for implementing the T7CONSlac promoter (Protocol 1) and/or the TIR (Protocol 2). The oligonucleotides have complementarity to the plasmid template at their 3’ ends and to each other at their 5’ ends. The sequences are provided in Table 2.Table 2.
