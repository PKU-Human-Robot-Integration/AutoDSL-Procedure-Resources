    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPrepare fecal inocula\nTiming: 1 h\nReceive the fecal sample from the participant, take aliquots for later DNA extraction and combine remaining fecal matter with sodium phosphate buffer to produce a 16% w/v inoculum for ex vivo fermentation experiments.\nImmediately transfer the sample to the anaerobic workstation\nPartition five aliquots of 0.5 g feces into 2 mL cryovials and freeze immediately at −80°C (for DNA extraction)\nTransfer 96 g of the remaining sample into a sterile sample collection pottle\nAdd 300 mL sterile pre-reduced sodium phosphate buffer\nSeal the pottle with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer bar inside and gently mix on a magnetic stirrer plate for 5 min in anaerobic conditions\nCritical: Treat unscreened fecal samples as potentially infectious. Handle under strict Physical Containment 2 procedures. Wear double-gloves, a face mask, and eye protection always. Clean surfaces thoroughly with 75% ethanol.\nNote: This will produce an inoculum of 32% w/v.\nNote: Gentle stirring helps to homogenize the inoculum. Avoid vigorous stirring, which can reduce methanogen viability.\nStrain the inoculum through a double layer of cheesecloth with 16 threads per cm in both directions, within the anaerobic workstation\nNote: This method of filtration helps to ensure that the inoculum contains both attached and unattached microorganisms (Williams et al., 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib31]).\nPrepare fermentation bottles\nTiming: 1 h\nAdd the fecal inocula and the sodium phosphate buffer to the serum bottles to begin the fermentations.\nIn the anaerobic workstation, add 5 mL sodium phosphate buffer to all serum bottles; add an additional 5 mL sodium phosphate buffer to positive blanks.\nAdd 5 mL fecal inoculum to all serum bottles containing test substrates, and to the negative blanks (final concentration 16% w/v inocula).\nSeal the serum bottles with a rubber bung and crimp cap.",
    "Remove from the anaerobic workstation and immediately transfer to a shaking incubator at 37°C and 50 rpm.\nNote: Each fermentation bottle contains 10 mL fluid in total with 40 mL headspace.\nHarvest fermentation bottles\nTiming: 48 h\nAt the following time points (hours of fermentation), harvest one set (duplicate) of bottles; 0, 3, 6, 10, 24, and 48 for sampling.\nRemove the harvested bottles from the incubator and immediately transfer to a water bath at 37°C.\nUse a gas pressure probe to measure the gas pressure in the bottle, via a needle through the bung. Troubleshooting Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]\nNote: Before the experiment, calibrate the pressure probe by injecting air into a 50 mL serum bottle with 10 mL water inside. Inject known volumes of air and measure the probe with the pressure to create a calibration curve. Conduct the calibration at 37°C. Use the calibration curve to calculate mL of gas produced.\nRemove 2 mL headspace gas using a syringe and inject into a 5.9 mL Exetainer vial for later GC analysis of hydrogen and methane.\nRemove 0.6 mL fermentation fluid from all bottles except those for dry matter and organic matter quantification\nInject 0.5 mL into a five-times volume of RNAlater Stabilization Solution\nInject 0.1 mL into a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 1 mL zinc acetate solution (2%) (for sulfide determination)\nMix each sample and freeze at −80°C\nPlunge samples into an ice water bath for 20 min to slow bacterial activity (Feng et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Warren et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28]).\nUse a pH probe to measure and record the pH of the samples. Troubleshooting Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]\nTransfer samples to 15 mL centrifuge tubes\nCentrifuge at 6,750 × g for 15 min at 4°C\nRemove two aliquots of 1.5 mL supernatant for later metabolite profiling",
    "Centrifuge the remaining supernatant at 24,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C\nAliquot the remaining supernatant into 1.5 mL fractions\nHomogenize the pellet with a spatula and split into two equal aliquots\nFreeze all samples at −80°C\nPause Point: Analyze samples for sulfide determination within 3 months of collection to minimize the loss of sulfide\nSample analysis\nTiming: 8–12 weeks\nPrepare samples for the following analyses; metagenomics, metabolomics, metatranscriptomics, organic acids, headspace gases, sulfide, dry matter, and organic matter.\nExtract DNA from the fermentation pellet and fecal aliquots and conduct whole-genome sequencing\nUse the NucleoSpin Soil kit following the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.takarabio.com/assets/documents/User%20Manual/NucleoSpin%20Soil%20Genomic%20DNA%20Purification%20User%20Manual_Rev_05.pdf] with the addition of a bead-beating step for 4 min to extract DNA from the samples (BioSpec Mini-Beadbeater 96, Bartlesville, OK, United States) (Young et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib36])\nPrepare libraries using the Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-free kit\nSequence DNA on an Illumina MiSeq with 24–30 million paired-end reads per run (read length 2 × 150 base pairs), and output of 3–4.5 gigabytes per run\nAnalyze one set of supernatant samples by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine the relative abundance of all detectable metabolites. For LC-MS (Vanden Bussche et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]):\nThaw supernatant samples and centrifuge at 13,300 × g for 5 min\nSyringe filter sample through a 13 mm diameter, 0.22 μm pore size Polyvinylidene Fluoride filter\nDilute sample 1:5 with ultrapure water\nRun sample through the LC-MS with an HSS-T3 C18 column (1.8 μm, 150 mm × 2.1 mm)\nNote: This is a reversed-phase column which will not retain highly polar molecules, allowing semi-polar and non-polar molecules to elute for MS analysis.\nRun the mass spectrometer in polarity switching mode, with sheath, auxiliary and sweep gas at 50, 25, and 5 arbitrary units, respectively",
    "Set the heater and capillary temperatures to 350°C and 250°C\nSet the tube lens, skimmer, capillary, and spray voltages to 60 V, 20 V, 90 V, and 5 kV (±), respectively\nApply a scan range of m/z 50−800, and a resolution 100 000 FWHM at 1 Hz For GC-MS (Farag et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]):\nTo 200 μL sample, add 800 μL of acetonitrile/methanol (1:1 v/v) mixture\nIncubate at 4°C for 30 min\nCentrifuge sample at 12,000 × g for 4 min\nTake 100 μL of the sample, and evaporate to dryness under a stream of nitrogen\nAdd 150 μL N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide to the residue and incubate at 60°C for 40 min\nRun the samples on the GC-MS using an Rtx-5MS column (30 m length, 0.25 mm inner diameter, and 0.25 μm film)\nSet injections to a 1:15 split mode\nSet the injector at 280°C, column oven at 80°C for 2 min, rate 5°C/minute until 315°C, then maintain for 12 min\nUse Helium as the carrier gas at 1 mL/minute\nSet transfer line and ion-source temperatures to 280°C and 180°C, respectively\nExtract total RNA from the fermentation fluid stored in RNAlater Stabilization Solution and conduct RNA-seq analyses\nUse the RNeasy Mini Kit to extract total RNA from samples, according to the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.qiagen.com/es/resources/resourcedetail?id=14e7cf6e-521a-4cf7-8cbc-bf9f6fa33e24&lang=en]\nPrepare libraries using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA library preparation kit\nAnalyze mRNA on an Illumina Miseq generating short-read data, with 44–50 million paired-end reads per run (read length 2 × 75 base pairs), and an output of 3–3.8 Gigabytes per run\nAnalyze gas samples on a GC fitted with a TCD to measure hydrogen and methane concentration.\nPrepare one set of supernatant samples according to the referenced protocol (Richardson et al., 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]) for analysis of organic acids using a GC-FID.\nFor the sulfide assay:\nThaw frozen samples",
    "Add 0.1 mL sample to 1 mL distilled water\nAdd 0.1 mL diamine solution and 0.1 mL Fe solution and mix\nStand for 10 min at 21°C–27°C\nRead and record the optical density (OD670) Troubleshooting Problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]\nNote: The rate of air-water transfer of sulfide and the final equilibrium are affected by both temperature and pH. If samples differ in either of these factors, a calculation to account for variances in dissociation and emission can be used (Yongsiri et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib35]).\nFor entire fermentation samples kept for dry matter and organic matter quantification:\nDry the total fermentation (supernatant and pellet) to a constant temperature in an oven at 103°C to determine the dry matter content (ISO 6496 1999)\nAsh the dry matter samples in a furnace at 550°C to determine organic matter content (ISO 5984 1978)\nNote: Only time points from the start and end of the fermentation need to undergo dry matter and organic matter quantification (0 and 48 h).\nOptional: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR) may be used as an initial screening tool for differences in metabolites occurrence. It can inform the targeting strategy for LC-MS and GC-MS analyses. The fermentation supernatant is suitable for solution-state NMR. After freeze-drying, the fermentation pellet is suitable for solid-state NMR analysis which can indicate changes in the chemical composition of the test substrates used."
