    "Immunofluorescent staining of proteins found within mRNP granules allows for the visualization of subcellular mRNP granule homeostasis. Cells are grown on microscopy-optimized plates and treated with sodium arsenite, which induces stress granule formation in mammalian cells in an eIF2α phosphorylation–dependent manner (Bernstam & Nriagu, 2000[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-bib-0002]). Following treatment, the cells are fixed and permeabilized. Primary antibodies are used to bind to the protein of interest, that is, an mRNP granule marker. Subsequently, a secondary antibody, raised against the species of the primary antibody and conjugated to a specific fluorophore, binds to the primary antibody. The localization and quantity of subcellular particles present within a given cell provide insight into a number of aspects related to mRNP granule biology, such as mRNA stability and mRNP granule homeostasis and dynamics.\nMaterials\nCollagen solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-rec-0001])\nPrimary myoblasts (see Support Protocol)\nComplete myoblast growth medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-rec-0003]), 37°C\nSterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-rec-0011])\n0.125 mM sodium arsenite (Sigma, cat. no.

To coat plates, pipet 400 µl collagen solution onto coverslip (inner circular area) of a 35-mm imaging plate, covering its surface area. After 30 min, remove collagen solution and leave plate to dry for ≥2 hr.\nSteps 1 to 3 should be performed in a tissue culture hood.\nThe collagen solution can be reused up to five times.\n2. Seed primary myoblasts in 2 ml pre-warmed complete myoblast growth medium onto collagen-coated plate. Culture cells in a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator until they reach a confluency of ∼70% (2 to 3 days).\n3. Optional: Aspirate medium from the plate and wash cells once with sterile PBS. Add 2 ml of 0.125 mM sodium arsenite or vehicle (sterile MilliQ water) diluted in complete myoblast growth medium (treatment medium) to a total volume of 2 ml and incubate cells for 1 hr in the incubator.\nInduction of stress granules is optional. We suggest including this step as a positive control to induce stress granule formation to ensure the validity of conclusions drawn from experiments.\nFixation, permeabilization, and antibody staining",
    "4. Aspirate complete myoblast growth medium from step 2 or treatment medium from step 3 and wash cells once with PBS. Add 400 µl formaldehyde solution to cells on the coverslip in the plate and incubate samples for 20 min at room temperature.\n5. Aspirate formaldehyde solution and wash plate three times with PBS for 5 min each.\nPotential pause point: Cells can be left at 4°C in PBS for up to 14 days.\n6. Aspirate PBS and incubate cells on the coverslip with 400 µl IF permeabilization solution for 10 min at room temperature.\n7. Aspirate IF permeabilization solution and wash with cold IF washing solution for 10 min at room temperature. Repeat this step for a total of three times.\n8. Aspirate IF washing solution and incubate cells on the coverslip with 400 µl cold IF blocking solution for ≥1 hr at room temperature.\nBlocking solution contains bovine serum albumin (BSA) and donkey serum (the serum of the animal used to make the secondary antibody), which prevent nonspecific binding of the antibodies.\n9. Using primary antibodies that stain against mRNPs, such as G3BP1, DCP1A, and RCK, prepare cold IF primary antibody solution as indicated in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-tbl-0001]. Aspirate IF blocking solution from the plate and add 250 µl IF primary antibody solution to cells on the coverslip. Incubate overnight at 4°C.\nPrimary antibodies of different species can be applied simultaneously. Primary antibodies of the same species can also be used sequentially, as described previously (Buchwalow, Samoilova, Boecker, & Tiemann, 2018[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-bib-0007]). Primary antibody solutions can be saved and reused for subsequent samples. The ability to reuse antibodies is antibody dependent, and the number of times that an antibody can be reused should be tested.",
    "10. Aspirate IF primary antibody solution from the plate. Wash cells with cold IF washing solution for 10 min at room temperature. Repeat this wash step for a total of three times.\n11. Prepare cold IF secondary antibody solution as indicated in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-tbl-0002]. Aspirate IF washing solution from the plate and add 250 µl to cells on the coverslip. From this point, cover plate in aluminum foil to protect the samples from light. Incubate for 1 hr at room temperature.\nSecondary antibodies against different species can be applied simultaneously.\n12. Aspirate IF secondary antibody solution from the plate. Wash cells with cold IF washing solution for 10 min at room temperature. Repeat this wash step for a total of three times.\nSample mounting and imaging\n13. Aspirate IF washing solution and let plate air-dry on an angle for 5 min. Collect any remaining washing solution at bottom of the angled plate with a P200 micropipet. Add one drop of mounting medium with DAPI to center of the coverslip in the plate. With tweezers, place one 18-mm-diameter circular coverslip above the mounting medium and drop at an angle. If air bubbles are trapped under the 18-mm coverslip, tap coverslip gently with tweezers or a P200 micropipet tip to remove them, as air bubbles may interfere with imaging. Dry coverslip overnight at room temperature in the dark. The next day, store samples at 4°C until imaging.\nAlternatively, nuclei staining and mounting can be performed in separate steps to reduce background. We recommend staining with DAPI for 5 min, followed by a wash step and then mounting with ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Fisher, cat. no. P10144).",
    "The 18-mm-diameter circular coverslip adequately covers the surface of the polymer coverslip at the bottom of the 35-mm plate, thus allowing the mounting medium to dry and harden. In this case, the 18-mm coverslip is not used for direct imaging of the samples. It is important to wait for the mounting medium to cure before proceeding to image the samples (see step 14). If the mounting medium is not entirely cured, this results in a blurry image.\n14. Using an inverted microscope with a motorized stage allowing Z-stack capability, capture Z-stacks of samples in the microscope software using the optimal spacing for Z-stacks.\nIt is highly recommended to use a high-resolution immersion objective with a numerical aperture ≥1.3. In our work, we use the Plan-Neofluar 100× NA1.30 objective (Zeiss, cat. no. 000000-1018-595) with immersion oil (Immersol™ 518 F immersion oil, Zeiss, cat. no. 444960-0000-000). Use the optimal LED intensity and an adequate exposure time to reach a fluorescent signal intensity that will cover ideally 30% to 50% of the dynamic range of the camera. Never exceed 80% of the dynamic range to avoid overexposure of the image and subsequent photobleaching of samples. Images presented in this article (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-fig-0002] and 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-fig-0003]) were acquired with a pixel size of 0.031 µm/pixel and a Z-spacing of 0.49 µm.\nIf using the 35-mm µ-Dish ibiTreat Ibidi plate, cells are imaged using the microscopy-optimized #1.5 Ibidi polymer coverslip at the bottom of the plate. If using glass coverslips to image cells, it is important to use #1.5 (between 0.16 and 0.19 mm) to ensure image sharpness and quality.",
    "Z-stacks are used to capture the three-dimensional localization of subcellular particles within cells. If users of this protocol are not using ZEN software and therefore do not have access to the “optimal” Z-stack recommendation feature, the Z-spacing must follow the Nyquist criterion and be twice smaller than the optical sectioning to optimize deconvolution in subsequent steps (North, 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-bib-0032]).\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/da2f6f26-328e-4521-a53b-1df31b7cb81f/cpz1325-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nImmunofluorescence microscopy and automated quantification of mRNP granules.

The number of mRNP granules was then quantified using CellProfiler. The numbers of G3BP1-, DCP1A-, and RCK-positive subcellular particles per cell are shown in panels (B), (D), and (F), respectively. Scale bar represents 2 µm.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/53070cac-7c65-4c43-9897-4f011cb3810e/cpz1325-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3\nImmunofluorescence microscopy and automated quantification of autophagosomes.

Fluorescent microscopy Z-stacks were taken and deconvolved, and maximum intensity images were generated (Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-prot-0004]), for which representative images are shown. The number of autophagosomes per cell was quantified using CellProfiler (B). Scale bar represents 2 µm.",
    "Autophagy is a catabolic and self-destructive process involving the degradation of intracellular aggregates and damaged organelles (Glick, Barth, & Macleod, 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-bib-0016]). In the case of autophagy, cargo is sequestered within a double-membrane entity known as the autophagosome (Glick et al., 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-bib-0016]). Here, we outline an automated method to count the number of autophagosomes per cell to gain insight into the autophagic state of primary myoblasts. We alter the protocol presented in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-prot-0001] to include the inhibition of lysosomal proteases using bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), an inhibitor of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase, as well as the use of anti-WIPI2 antibody, which identifies autophagosomes, for immunodetection.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-prot-0001])\n100 nM BafA1 (Sigma, cat. no. 196000, CAS: 88899-55-2) or vehicle (sterile 100% dimethyl sulfoxide; DMSO; BioShop, cat. no.

Aspirate complete myoblast growth medium from the plate and wash once with sterile PBS. Add appropriate volume of 100 nM BafA1 or vehicle (sterile 100% DMSO) diluted in complete myoblast growth medium (treatment medium) to the plate.\nInhibiting autophagic flux with BafA1 is strongly suggested to prevent the turnover of autophagosomes. Comparison between BafA1-treated and untreated cells provides an indicator of autophagic flux within cells.\nAntibody staining, sample mounting, and imaging\n3.

    "Magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) is an efficient and gentle approach for isolating primary cells from tissue. Here, we describe the isolation of primary myoblasts from skeletal muscle tissue obtained from the hind limbs of mice. Dissected muscles are enzymatically digested and homogenized using a gentleMACS Octo Dissociator with Heaters instrument. Muscle homogenates are subjected to filtration and centrifugation, followed by negative cell selection and subsequently positive cell selection using magnetic cell separators. This protocol yields a pure population of primary myoblasts that can be passaged and cultured on collagen-coated tissue culture dishes (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-prot-0001] and Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-prot-0002]).\nMaterials\nPBS (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-rec-0011]), sterile, 4°C\nCollagenase/dispase solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-rec-0001])\nFetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, cat. no. 12483020)\nMACS buffer (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-rec-0010]), 4°C\nSatellite Cell Isolation Kit, mouse, including satellite cell isolation cocktail (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. no. 130-104-268)\nAnti-integrin α-7 MicroBeads, mouse (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. no. 130-104-261)\nComplete myoblast growth medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-rec-0003]), 37°C\nSharp dissection scissors (Fine Science Tools, cat. no. 14060-11 and 14184-09)\nNon-coated and collagen-coated (see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-prot-0001], step 1) 6-cm tissue culture dishes (Fisher, cat. no. 08772B)\ngentleMACS C tubes (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. no. 130-093-237)\ngentleMACS Octo Dissociator with Heaters (Miltenyi Biotec, cat. no. 130-096-427)\n70-μm cell strainer (Falcon, cat. no. 352350)\n15- and 50-ml conical tubes, sterile (FroggaBio, cat. no.

    "1. Sacrifice mice according to institutional animal care guidelines. Using dissection scissors, remove fur and skin of the hind limbs to expose the hind limb muscles.\n2. Dissect out hind limb muscles and place muscles in a non-coated 6-cm tissue culture dish filled with cold sterile PBS kept on ice. Remove any visible fur, fat, and bones and avoid contaminating muscle preparation with blood. Transfer muscles to a new non-coated 6-cm tissue culture dish containing PBS to further clean the muscles.\n3. Transfer muscles to an empty non-coated 6-cm tissue culture dish and remove as much PBS as possible. Then, transfer muscles to a gentleMACS C tube. Mince muscles directly in the tube with sharp dissection scissors. When the tissue chunks reach ∼2 mm3 in size, add 5 ml collagenase/dispase solution. Continue mincing tissue and rinse scissors in the solution.\n4. Secure cap onto the C tube and invert tube, ensuring that all muscle pieces come down into the solution. Insert C tube into the gentleMACS Octo Dissociator with Heaters and place heater element on top of the C tube. Perform a 2-min “Slice and Dice” using the following program parameters: 1. temp ON; 2. loop 10×; 3. spin 360 rpm, 5”; 4. spin –360 rpm, 5”; 5. end loop; 6. end. Then, perform a 25-min “Muscle Digestion” program: 1. temp ON; 2. spin 60 rpm, 3’ 0”; 3. spin –30 rpm, 9’ 0”; 4. loop 10×; 5. spin 360 rpm, 5”; 6. spin –360 rpm, 5”; 7. end loop; 8. spin –30 rpm, 12’ 0”; 9. end. At the end of the program, remove heater element and C tube from the instrument.",
    "The result of this step is a homogenous cell suspension without any aggregates or clumps. Although we suggest using the Dissociator instrument as an automated approach for obtaining homogenous cell suspensions with increased viability, it is possible to perform the digestion and homogenization manually. In this case, muscles should be minced in a 6-cm tissue culture dish with 5 ml collagenase/dispase as in step 3. The plate containing minced tissue should then be placed in a 37°C incubator for 30 min. Every 10 min, the plate should be removed, and additional mincing should be performed.\nHomogenate preparation\n5. To quench the digestion, open C tube and add 5 ml FBS. Mix well by pipetting up and down.\nThis and the following steps (steps 5 to 16) should be performed in a tissue culture hood to minimize potential contamination of primary cell cultures.\n6. Place a 70-μm cell strainer on top of a 50-ml conical tube and pre-wet strainer with 2 ml FBS. Add muscle cell suspension gradually to the strainer and collect flow-through. Rinse empty C tube with 8 ml PBS by closing the cap and shaking vigorously to maximize cell yield and pass PBS through the cell strainer. Rinse C tube again with another 8 ml PBS and pass solution through the cell strainer.\n7. Transfer filtered cell suspension into two 15-ml conical tubes and centrifuge 10 min at 600 × g. Aspirate fatty floating layer sitting on top of the supernatant and then aspirate supernatant, leaving ∼100 µl of supernatant volume above the pellet. Resuspend each pellet in 100 µl cold MACS buffer and combine the two pellets into one 15-ml conical tube.\nCell labeling and separation",
    "8. For negative cell labeling, add 20 µl satellite cell isolation cocktail (from Satellite Cell Isolation Kit). Mix by gently agitating tube and incubate at 4°C for 15 min. Then, add 300 µl cold MACS buffer to adjust volume of the cell lysate to ∼500 µl.\n9. Place an LD separation column in a MidiMACS or QuadroMACS separator placed onto a MACS MultiStand. Add 2 ml cold MACS buffer to column to pre-wet the column.\n10. For negative selection, place a clean 15-ml conical tube under column and add 500-µl cell suspension to the column. Collect the unlabeled cells that pass through the column. When there is no more flow-through coming out of the column, wash column with 1 ml cold MACS buffer. Perform a second wash with an additional 1 ml cold MACS buffer. Collect all flow-through in the same tube.\nIt is important to wait until there is no more liquid on top of the magnetic beads within the column before adding additional solution. The flow-through contains unlabeled cells that include satellite cells.\n11. Centrifuge cells for 5 min at 600 × g. Aspirate supernatant, leaving ∼100 µl of supernatant volume above pellet. Resuspend cell pellet in 100 µl cold MACS buffer.\n12. For positive cell labeling, add 20 µl anti-integrin α-7 MicroBeads. Mix by gently agitating tube and incubate at 4°C for 15 min. Then, add 400 µl cold MACS buffer to adjust volume of the cell lysate to ∼500 µl.\n13. Place an MS separation column in a MiniMACS or OctoMACS separator placed onto a MACS MultiStand. Add 500 µl cold MACS buffer to column to pre-wet the column.",
    "14. For positive selection, add 500-µl cell suspension to the column. When there is no more flow-through coming out of the column, wash column three times with 500 µl cold MACS buffer. Discard flow-through, which contains the unlabeled cell fraction.\nLabeled satellite cells are retained in the column.\n15. Remove column from the MACS MultiStand and place column into a clean 15-ml conical tube. Add 1 ml cold MACS buffer to column and immediately flush out cells by pushing the provided plunger through the column. Repeat this step with another 1 ml cold MACS buffer and combine the two flow-throughs. Centrifuge cells for 5 min at 600 × g.\n16. Remove supernatant, making sure to leave 100 µl of supernatant volume above pellet (which should be barely visible). Resuspend cell pellet in 5 ml pre-warmed complete myoblast growth medium and transfer to a collagen-coated 6-cm tissue culture dish. Incubate cells in a 37°C, 5% CO2 humidified incubator for 2 days.\nIt is recommended not to disturb the culture for 2 days to allow the cells to settle and attach to the dish. Primary myoblasts are small round cells that appear bright under a transmitted light microscope. Debris and floating cells may be observed at 2 days following the isolation. Medium should be changed and replenished every 2 days, and cells can be passaged and transferred to new collagen-coated plates when they reach approximately 60% to 70% confluency.",
    "For an unbiased and automated approach to quantifying stress granules, P-bodies, and autophagosomes (referred to as subcellular particles), we use CellProfiler (Carpenter et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-bib-0008]). This software allows for high-throughput analysis of a large number of images to relate subcellular particle count to specific cells following immunofluorescence imaging (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-prot-0001] and Alternate Protocol[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-prot-0002]). Deconvolution of Z-stacked images, where each slice from each fluorescent channel is exported as a TIFF, is recommended to allow for particle counts across many focal planes within a cell. Maximum intensity projections of DAPI images and subcellular particle images are generated using slices from the appropriate fluorescent channel in CellProfiler. DAPI staining is used to identify individual nuclei of cells, and subcellular particle layer(s) are also independently split into gray 8-bit images for analysis. The nuclei, using DAPI images, and cytoplasms, using particle images, of individual cells are then identified after smoothing using global Otsu thresholding (Otsu, 1979[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-bib-0034]). Cytoplasms are also expanded to ensure complete encapsulation of each cell's cytoplasm. Once appropriately identified, the 8-bit gray-scaled particle images are enhanced using provided modules within CellProfiler to increase the intensity of particles within each image. The enhanced particles are then overlayed within the expanded cytoplasm to generate a mask to restrict particle counting within each cell. Following this, individual particles are identified based on fluorescence using adaptive Otsu thresholding (used in this case to adjust for non-uniform cytoplasmic staining) (Otsu, 1979[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-bib-0034]). Finally, particle counts are directly related to independent cells using previously identified nuclei, allowing for counting of “particles” per cell, exported into .csv format. Importantly, prior to high-throughput/batch analysis of large numbers of images, 20% of images are randomly selected to calibrate and validate particle counts prior to quantification for each experiment.\nMaterials\nZeiss ZEN Blue software (Version 3.2.0.0000)\nComputer",
    "CellProfiler (download for free at https://cellprofiler.org/releases[href=https://cellprofiler.org/releases])\n1. To deconvolve Z-stacks, open Zeiss ZEN Blue software on a computer:\n         \nOpen Z-stacks using ZEN image processing within the software.\nUnder the “Processing” header, open “Method” tab. Select “Deconvolution (defaults)” in “Method” tab.\nUnder the “Method Parameters” section of “Processing,” open “Parameters” tab. Select deconvolution method best suited to the given sample.\nThere are three different deconvolution settings offered: “Simple, very fast (Nearest Neighbor),” “Better, fast (Regularized Inverse Filter),” and “Good, medium speed (Fast Iterative).” Deconvoluted Z-stacks in this paper were generated using “Simple, very fast (Nearest Neighbor)” for presentation purposes and qualitative analysis. However, the “Nearest Neighbor” algorithm is not quantitative so should not be used to quantify fluorescence intensity. To obtain quantitative deconvoluted Z-stacks, we suggest using the “Fast Iterative” algorithm. To learn more about quantitative deconvolution, we refer the reader to the referenced chapter (Goodwin, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-bib-0017]). Deconvolution can also be performed using third-party software, such as the DeconvolutionLab2 plugin for FIJI.\nDeconvolution uses model-based methods to increase the sharpness of images by subtracting the out-of-focus fluorescence due to the diffracted light, which causes the typical blur of wide-field images (see Current Protocols article; Biggs, 2010[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-bib-0003]; Goodwin, 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-bib-0017]). This increases the signal-to-background ratio, which allows for clearer presentation of puncta and thus subcellular particles.\nUnder the “Image Parameters” section of “Processing,” open “Input” tab. Drag desired Z-stack into the “Input” tab.\nUnder the “Image Parameters” section of “Processing,” open “Output” tab. Specify name of the output Z-stack by typing it into the “Custom Output Name” box.\nClick “Apply” button at the top of the “Processing” display.\nSave deconvoluted Z-stack in .czi file format. Save each slice of each fluorescent channel within Z-stack as a TIFF.",
    "For faster high-throughput analysis, it is recommended to perform the deconvolution processing in batch format. In the “Processing” tab, select the “Batch” function. Click “+ Add” to select all your images to deconvolve. Under the “Batch method” section, choose “Deconvolution,” which will be applied only to the first image in the table. Select this first image and then select “Copy Parameters.” Select all the other images in the table and select “Paste parameters,” followed by “Run Selected.”\n2. To generate maximum intensity images, using CellProfiler (Carpenter et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-bib-0008]), create a maximum intensity image from slices within each Z-stack:\n         \nIn the “Metadata” module, enable metadata extraction. To allow for grouping of multiple files, in “Groups” module, select the appropriate subfolder name to group by metadata category.\nCreate and name maximum projection images using “MakeProjection” module, selecting “Maximum” as the type of projection.\nSave maximum projection images using “SaveImages” module.\nMaximum projection images must be generated prior to feeding these images into the subcellular particle counting pipeline, described in step 3, as the “MakeProjection” module does not become available in subsequent modules until completion of all the image processing cycles.\n3. To create the analysis pipeline for subcellular particle counting, using CellProfiler (Carpenter et al., 2006[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-bib-0008]), generate a pipeline for automated image analysis through addition of individual modules made available in CellProfiler using the following steps:\n         \nIdentify nuclei by addition of “IdentifyPrimaryObjects” module using the grayscale maximum intensity DAPI image as the input image. Name identified primary objects (here, we use “Nuclei” as an example). Within the “IdentifyPrimaryObjects” module, select “Global Otsu Thresholding” using two-class thresholding.\nSmoothing can optionally be used to simplify nucleus identification. Clumped objects can optionally be distinguished by shape.",
    "Identify cytoplasms by addition of “IdentifySecondaryObjects” module using the grayscale maximum projection image as the input image and using the identified nuclei (see step 3a) as the input objects. Name identified secondary objects (here, we use “Cytoplasm” as an example). Within the “IdentifySecondaryObjects” module, select “Global Otsu Thesholding” using two-class thresholding.\nIn our work, cytoplasms were identified using the “Watershed” option within the module (Shafarenko, Petrou, & Kittler, 1997[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.325#cpz1325-bib-0039]). Smoothing can optionally be used to simplify cytoplasm identification.\nTo ensure complete encapsulation of each cytoplasm, expand size of each cytoplasm by 2 to 5 pixels (depending on the magnification of the image) using the “ExpandOrShrinkObjects” module and using the identified “Cytoplasm” as the input object.\nWe term the input object “ExpandedCytoplasm.”\nTo enhance particles within images, use “EnhanceOrSuppressFeatures” module to apply filtering and opt to enhance the intensity of particle features specifically based on their size.\nWe name the output image “EnhancedParticles.”\nOverlay “EnhancedParticles” images within the “ExpandedCytoplasm” using the “MaskImage” module to generate a mask to restrict particle counting within each cell.\nThis image is named “MaskParticles.”\nTo identify the individual particles within each image, use “IdentifyPrimaryObjects” module with the “MaskParticles” image as the input image. Name identified primary objects (here, we use “Particles” as an example). Ensure measurement of average diameter and intensity of particles to limit identification. Within the “IdentifyPrimaryObjects” module, select “Adaptive Otsu Thresholding” using two-class thresholding.\nWe recommend to avoid using smoothing or any distinguishing of clumped objects.\nAfter particles found within “MaskImage” have been identified, use “RelateObjects” module to directly relate particle counts to independent cells.\nMore specifically, we use “Nuclei” objects as the parent objects and “Particles” objects as the child objects within the module. Ultimately, this allows for the counting of “Particles” per cell.",
    "Export counts of particles per cell to .csv format using the “ExportToSpreadsheet” module.\nSpecifically, the “Nuclei” data should be exported to ensure that the particle-to-cell relationship is being studied. Counts will be separate based on image and the cell within each image.\nSave pipeline.\n4. To run the analysis pipeline for subcellular particle counting, organize deconvoluted Z-stack slices as TIFFs within subfolders, where the subfolder name and file name distinguish the channel (for example, “SubfolderC1” subfolder name and file name prefix “C1_” for Alexa Fluor 488 slices in TIFF format). Drag parent folder into Cell Profiler. Click “Analyze Images” button."
