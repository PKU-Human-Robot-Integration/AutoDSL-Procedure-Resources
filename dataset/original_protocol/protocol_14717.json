    "This protocol has been conducted at our institution with approval from the institutional research ethics board and is in compliance with all institutional, national, and international guidelines for human welfare.\n1. Collection of Peripheral Blood from Patients with Advanced Prostate Cancer\nNote: Select patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Obtain written patient consent and record clinical characteristics of patients, including age at isolation and previous chemotherapy and hormonal treatments. Patients with metastatic disease will potentially have highest concentration of CTCs in peripheral blood.\nCollect blood samples after informed consent and under an appropriate Institutional Review Board approved protocol. Wear latex gloves and a laboratory coat throughout the procedure.\nConnect 25 G butterfly needle and tubing to needle holder. Use an alcohol swab to clean area of antecubital vein between bicep and forearm, then apply tourniquet to patient’s upper arm.\nInsert butterfly needle into antecubital vein and push blood collection tube into needle holder to start collection. Collect approximately 10 ml of blood in collection tubes that contain ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to prevent clotting.\nRemove butterfly needle from patient and apply pressure with sterile gauze pad over site of vein puncture for 1 min. Cover site with a sterile bandage.\n2. Isolation of Mononuclear Cells\nNote: The blood collected from step 1 will contain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (e.g., lymphocytes and monocytes) in addition to the mononuclear CTCs.\nPipette whole blood into 50 ml polystyrene conical tube with a 5 ml serological pipette and add Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) in a 1:1 ratio. Gently pipette mixture to homogenize.\nAdd 15 ml of a commercially prepared solution (Ficoll-Paque) to separate blood components by low speed density gradient centrifugation to an empty 50 ml polystyrene conical tube.",
    "Gently pipette whole blood and HBSS mixture, from step 2.1, into the polystyrene tube from step 2.2, to form distinct top layer. Set pipette to lowest setting to minimize mixing of solutions, this will ensure efficient separation.\nCentrifuge at 400 x g for 30 min at RT (25 °C). Set deceleration to lowest setting to prevent mixing of solutions after separation. Acceleration may be set to any speed.\nAfter centrifugation, identify the thin white-grey stripe of PBMCs and CTCs sandwiched layer between plasma on top and separation solution at the bottom of the tube.\nCollect the cells from the white-grey stripe in step 2.5 into a 50 ml polystyrene tube using a plastic transfer pipette.\nAdd HBSS to 50 ml polystyrene conical tube with PBMCs and CTCs and centrifuge again at 400 x g for 10 min RT to wash.\nDecant liquid and resuspend pellet in 50 ml of HBSS and centrifuge again at 400 x g for 3 min at RT to wash.\nDiscard the supernatant, resuspend the remaining pellet with 5 ml of Red Blood Cell Lysis buffer and incubate the solution for 5 min at RT.\nRemove the red blood cell lysis buffer by centrifugation at 400 x g for 3 min at RT.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml PBS 1x supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) to block prior to antibody staining.\n3. Staining Mononuclear Cells with CD45-FITC Antibody for Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)\nQuantify the number of viable (trypan blue-negative) cells (from step 2.11) using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter. Prepare a 1 x 106 cells/ml suspension (in PBS 1x with 10% FBS) and place it on ice for 1 hr.",
    "Distribute the quantified cell suspension from the previous step into two tubes. Label tubes as control and CD45 staining.\nIn the control tube, add IgG1κ-FITC (2.5 µg/ml) at a dilution of 1:250. In the CD45 staining tube, add CD45 FITC (2.5 µg/ml) conjugated primary antibody at a dilution of 1:250 and incubate the cell suspensions on ice for 30 min. CD45 antigen labeling is used to exclude hematopoietic cells.\nCentrifuge the cells at 400 x g for 3 min at 4 °C, and discard the supernatant.\nWash the cells twice, by suspending each pellet with sterile 1 x PBS supplemented with 10% FBS followed by centrifugation at 400 x g for 3 min at 4 °C.\nResuspend the cells in a 1 ml solution of PBS 1x containing 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) at a concentration of 10 µg/ml.\nFilter the final solution through 35 µm strainer caps into 12 mm x 75 mm polystyrene tubes.\n4. Isolation of Prostate CTCs by FACS\nNote: Utilize a flow cytometer to collect live CD45 negative CTCs.\nSet compensation controls using cells from the tube labeled, “Control.”\nCreate gates that exclude debris and clusters of cells using appropriate forward-scatter and side-scatter parameters.\nEstablish the FITC gates using the cell suspensions from the tube labeled, “CD45-FITC.”\nGate viable (DAPI-negative) cells using the pacific blue-A channel.\nCollect CD45 negative population into a sterile 15 ml polystyrene conical tube containing 2 ml of Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS.\nCentrifuge the sorted prostate tumor cell suspension at 400 x g for 3 min, then resuspend the pellets in 200 - 500 µl of RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS.\n5. Injection of CTCs into Mice and Monitoring of Xenograft Growth",
    "Note: Conduct all animal procedures in compliance with protocols approved by the institutional animal care committee. This protocol has been conducted at our institution under a specific Animal Use Protocol approved by our Animal Care Committee in accordance and compliance with all relevant regulatory and institutional agencies, regulations and guidelines.\nMix the sorted prostate tumor cell suspension with extracellular matrix at a 1:1 ratio and place on ice.\nAnesthetize mouse prior to subcutaneous implantation in a chamber supplying 5% (v/v) inhaled isoflurane in 1 L/min of oxygen. Ensure appropriate anesthesia by checking for loss of corneal and toe reflex in the mouse.\nUsing a 25 G needle and a 1 ml syringe, inject 250 µl of prostate tumor cell and extracellular matrix cell suspension subcutaneously into both upper flanks of a 8-10 week old male immunodeficient mouse. Inject 250 µl regardless of CTC concentration as the injection volume is the important value. Maximum SQ administration in mouse is no more than 1 ml.  \nMonitor mice by performing weekly palpation of mouse injection sites for growth of subcutaneous nodular densities and by measuring mice weight twice a week.\nEuthanize mice by carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by cervical dislocation and harvest subcutaneous human prostate cancer xenografts when tumor size is more than 0.5 cm and less than 1 cm in greatest diameter to ensure enough tumor tissue for molecular analyses and serial passage. Euthanize mice with signs of distress or weight loss of 15% despite no tumor is palpable. \nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
