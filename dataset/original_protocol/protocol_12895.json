  "title": "Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Protocol for Low-abundance Embryonic Samples",
  "procedures": [
    "According to German animal care guidelines, no Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approval was necessary to perform the chicken embryo experiments. According to the local guidelines, only experiments with chicken HH44 (18-day) embryos and older require IACUC approval. However, the embryos used in this study were all in earlier stages of embryonic development (i.e., HH19 (72 h)).\nNOTE: The purpose of this protocol is to provide a detailed description of the ChIP assay so it can be effectively combined with qPCR or next-generation sequencing (i.e., ChIP-seq) to investigate histone modifications in low-abundance embryonic samples (ranging from 5 x 104 - 5 x 105 cells for each ChIP reaction) and different tissue types (Figure 1). The protocol should be applicable to investigating the binding profiles of transcription factors and co-activators (e.g., p300). However, due to the lower abundance of these regulatory proteins, larger cell numbers are likely to be required (5 x 105 - 5 x 106 cells for each ChIP reaction).\n1. Preparation of Eggs and Microdissection of the Chicken SNT\nNOTE: The procedure for microdissections technically differs from tissue to tissue and from animal model to animal model. This section describes in detail the dissection protocol used to obtain brachial SNT sections from stage-HH19 chicken embryos as an example.\nIncubate fertile white leghorn hen eggs, obtained from a local breeder, in horizontal orientation at 37 °C and 80% humidity for 3 days to get stage-HH19 chicken embryos.\nDetermine the stages according to the Hamburger and Hamilton chicken embryonic developmental staging system17.\nPerform all microdissections under cold conditions; otherwise, chromatin integrity could be compromised.\nIsolate the HH19 embryos.\nTo make the embryos accessible, extract 3 mL of albumin using a 10-mL syringe with a needle (0.90 x 40 mm) to lower the blastoderm.",
    "Make a small opening in the egg using fine scissors and add 1 mL of Locke solution (see the Supplementary Materials for the recipe) to facilitate the removal of extra-embryonic membranes.\nInject 10% Indian black ink/Locke solution by using a 1-mL syringe with a needle (0.55 x 25 mm2) under the blastoderm to make the visualization of the embryos easier.\nCut off the extra-embryonic membrane that surrounds the embryo using medical surgical fine scissors and forceps.\nUse a perforated spoon to transfer the embryo to a 4.5 cm Petri dish containing 20 mL of 1x PBS solution.\nDissect away the amnion and the remaining parts of extra-embryonic membrane using fine scissor and forceps under a stereomicroscope.\nCut the transverse SNT segment at the brachial level of the embryo, extending caudally into the thoracic region to isolate the SNT (Figure 2).\nRemove tissues that laterally/ventrally surround the SNT (e.g., lateral plate mesoderm, ectoderm, notochord, and aorta) using forceps (Figure 2).\nImmerse each dissected chicken SNT segment in a 3.5 cm Petri dish containing 5 mL of warm (37 °C) trypsin (Trypsin/EDTA solution 1:250).\nStop the trypsin treatment when loosening of the non-neural tissues around the SNT is detected under a stereomicroscope.\n\tNOTE: The trypsinization time must be tightly controlled to avoid the over-digestion and dispersion of neural tissue and to retain the structural integrity of the SNT.\nAfter trypsin treatment, remove the remaining mesenchymal and ectodermal tissues manually to prepare the clean SNT section.\nTransfer the SNT section to a 1.5 mL tube and flash-freeze it in liquid nitrogen. Once sufficient SNT sections are accumulated (pool the SNT sections from ~30 chicken embryos for one ChIP reaction), store at -80 °C.",
    "NOTE: If sufficient embryonic tissue (i.e., 5 x 105 - 5 x 106 cells) can be dissected from a single or a few chicken embryos, then freezing is not necessary and it is possible to proceed directly to the next steps. Please refer to the troubleshooting guide in Table 1.\n\tNOTE: Caution! Liquid nitrogen has an extremely low temperature, wear appropriate protection.\n2. Crosslinking Proteins to DNA: Day 1\nNOTE: Perform all steps on ice unless stated otherwise.\nAdd 500 µL of DMEM with 10% FBS and 10 µL of 1 M Na-butyrate directly to the frozen tissue or, alternatively, immediately to the freshly dissected tissue. Homogenize the cells by re-suspending gently with a 1 mL pipette.\n\tNOTE: The addition of Na-butyrate is optional but recommended if investigating histone acetylation. Instead of DMEM-10% FBS, samples can be resuspended in 1x PBS with 0.1% BSA. The addition of FBS or BSA is optional, but it facilitates pelleting the samples in the subsequent centrifugation steps.\nAdd 13.5 µL of 37% formaldehyde (1% formaldehyde final) and place it on a rotator for 15 min at room temperature.\n\tNOTE: Caution! Formaldehyde is toxic.\nAdd 25 µL of 2.5 M glycine to the tube and place it on a rotator for 10 min at room temperature to quench the formaldehyde.\nSpin the tube at 850 x g for 5 min at 4 °C in a table-top centrifuge. Discard the supernatant.\nWash the pellet once with 500 µL of cold freshly prepared wash buffer (see the Supplementary Materials for the recipe), centrifuge at 850 x g and 4 °C for 5 min, and discard the supernatant.\n3. Lysis and Sonication",
    "Prepare complete lysis buffer (LB) (see the Supplementary Materials for the recipe) and chill on ice. For 1 mL, use 950 µL of LB, 40 µL of protease inhibitor concentrate (25x), and 10 µL of 100% PMSF.\nResuspend the pellet in 300 µL of complete LB by pipetting and place it on a rocking platform for 10 min at 4 °C.\nSonicate the samples using the following settings: Temp = 4 °C, Total time = 7 minutes, “on” interval = 30 s, “off” interval = 30 s, amplitude = 25%\n\tNOTE: Sonication conditions need to be optimized for each tissue and will vary depending on the sonicator used. It is recommended to use the lowest sonication settings that result in sheared DNA ranging from 200 to 600 bp in size. Shearing varies greatly depending on tissue type, quantity, sonication volume, crosslinking conditions, and equipment. Please refer to the troubleshooting guide in Table 1.\nSpin the sonicated sample at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C to pellet the cellular debris.\nTransfer the lysate (supernatant) to a fresh 1.5-mL tube.\n\tNOTE: If the starting material is deemed sufficient for two ChIP experiments, then 300 µL of complete LB can be added to the sonicated chromatin (i.e., final volume: 600 µL).\nAdd 30 µL of 10% octylphenol ethoxylate for every 300 µL of sonicated lysate (final concentration: 1%) and mix by pipetting.\n\tNOTE: Caution! Octylphenol ethoxylate is acutely toxic (oral, dermal, inhalation).\n4. Antibody Incubation\nAliquot the 330 µL of sonicated lysate into two 1.5-mL tubes: 300 µL for ChIP and 30 µL as the input control (10% of the starting material). Store the \"30 µL input control sample\" at -20 °C.",
    "NOTE: If two ChIP reactions are performed from the same sample, then the 660 µL of sonicated lysate can be distributed into three 1.5 mL tubes (300 µL for ChIP#1, 300 µL for ChIP#2, and 60 µL as input control (20% of the starting material of each ChIP)).\nAdd 3 - 5 µg of antibody to the 300 µL of sonicated chromatin aliquot and invert to mix.\n\tNOTE: In this study, each ChIP reaction was performed with an antibody specific for Histone H3 tri methylated at K4 (H3K4me3), Histone H3 di methylated at K4 (H3K4me2), Histone H3 tri methylated at K27 (H3K27me3), and Histone H3 tri acetylation at K27 (H3K27me3). The success of this protocol is entirely dependent on the quality of the antibody used. The antibody should be specific and efficient at the immunoprecipitation of a specific protein. It is important to determine the amount of antibody that can be used to immunoprecipitate the crosslinked protein-DNA complex. Also, the specificity of the antibody can be checked by Western blot to ensure that it detects the correct protein. An antibody that detects multiple nonspecific bands is not recommended for ChIP.\nPlace the tube on a rocking platform at 4 °C overnight (12 - 16 h) to bind the antibody to the chromatin.\n\tNOTE: Please refer to the troubleshooting guide in Table 1.\n5. Preparation of Magnetic Beads: Day 2\nAliquot 50 - 100 µL of Protein G/magnetic bead slurry for each ChIP reaction into a 1.5 mL microfuge tube on ice.",
    "Wash the magnetic beads three times with cold block solution (see the Supplementary Materials for the recipe) (4 °C). Add 500 µL of cold block solution and mix by inverting or flicking. Put the tube into a magnetic holder and wait for the beads to settle on the side of the tube. Pour off the clear liquid and repeat. After the last wash, remove all liquid with a gel-loading tip.\n6. Immunoprecipitation of the Chromatin\nAdd the 300 µL of antibody-bound chromatin to the washed beads and invert to mix.\nRotate vertically on a tube rotator at 4 °C for at least 4 h to bind the antibody to the beads.\n7. Wash, Elute, and Reverse the Crosslinks\nChill RIPA Wash Buffer (see the Supplementary Materials for the recipe) on ice, set the water bath to 65 °C, and precool the centrifuge to 4 °C.\nWash the chromatin-bound beads four times in 1 mL of cold RIPA Wash Buffer and keep on ice. To do so, add 1 mL of cold RIPA Wash Buffer and mix by inverting or flicking. Place the tube into the magnetic holder and wait for the beads to settle on the side of the tube. Pour off the clear liquid and repeat.\n\tNOTE: The number of washes with RIPA Wash Buffer might need to be optimized depending of the sample type, sample abundance, and antibody being used. An increased number of washes will diminish the background but will also decrease the total amount of recovered DNA, which can compromise downstream analysis by qPCR or ChIP-seq.\nAdd 1 mL of TE/50 mM NaCl to the tube and transfer the chromatin-bound beads in TE/50 mM NaCl to a fresh 1.5-mL microfuge tube before removing the liquid by using the magnetic holder, as described above.",
    "Spin the beads at 900 x g for 3 min at 4 °C, place the tube back into the magnetic holder, and remove all remaining TE with a gel-loading tip.\nAdd 210 µL of elution buffer (see the Supplementary Materials for the recipe) at room temperature and resuspend by flicking.\nElute for 15 min at 65 °C in a heat block while shaking.\nSpin the beads at 16,000 x g for 1 min at room temperature and place the tube into the magnetic holder.\nTransfer the supernatant (~200 µL) to a fresh microfuge tube once the beads have settled.\nThaw the input control samples (30 µL) from -20 °C to room temperature (frozen in step 4.1), add 3 volumes of elution buffer (90 µL), and mix by briefly vortexing.\nIncubate the chip and control samples at 65 °C overnight (12 - 16 h) to reverse the crosslinks.\n8. Digest Cellular Protein and RNA: Day 3\n8.1At room temperature, add 1 volume of TE buffer per tube (to dilute the SDS) and invert to mix: add 120 µL of TE to 120 µL of control sample and 200 µL of TE to 200 µL of the ChIP sample.\nAdd RNase A to a 0.2 mg/mL final concentration and invert to mix: add 2.4 µL of 20 mg/mL RNase A to 240 µL of control sample and 4 µL of 20 mg/mL RNase A to 400 µL of the ChIP sample.\nIncubate the tubes at 37 °C in a water bath for 2 h to digest the RNA.\nAdd Proteinase K to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/mL and invert to mix: add 2.4 µL of 20 mg/mL Proteinase K to 240 µL of control sample and 4 µL of 20 mg/mL Proteinase K to 400 µL of the ChIP sample.",
    "Incubate at 55 °C in a water bath for 2 h to digest the protein and purify the DNA.\n9. ChIP-qPCR\nNOTE: Perform DNA extraction and purification, as described in the Supplementary Materials.\nNOTE: Verify sonication efficiency as described in the Supplementary Materials, to confirm that 200- to 500-bp DNA fragments are obtained (Figure 3).\nNOTE: A critical step is to determine if the ChIP actually worked. If there are known genomic binding sites for the protein of interest, primers can be designed for quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine if the known sites are specifically enriched in the ChIP DNA, in comparison with negative-control regions not expected to be bound by the candidate proteins. As an example, this work shows the ChIP-qPCR results obtained with ChIPs performed for H3K4me3 (active promoter histone mark) and H3K27me3 (inactive promoter histone mark) in SNT sections isolated from HH14 chick embryos ( Figure 4A).\nMix each primer pair (forward and reverse) in the same tube and prepare a stock concentration at 20 µM each using dH2O (Table 2).\n\tNOTE: the efficiency of each primer pair should be evaluated before ChIP-qPCR analysis.\nUse the ChIP and 20% input control DNA obtained in step 8.5 for qPCR optimization.\n\tNOTE: The input DNA is typically diluted 20x (to 1% of the starting material used in the ChIP reactions) for qPCR analysis.\nFor each 10 µL of PCR, mix the following components in a PCR tube: for DNA mastermix, add 2 µL of dH2O, 2.5 µL of SYBR green mix, and 1 µL of DNA (from ChIP or 1% input); for mastermix with primers, add 2.375 µL of dH2O, 2.5 µL of SYBR green mix, and 0.125 µL of forward and reverse primer mix.",
    "Mix the samples by vortexing for 2 s and briefly centrifuge at 900 x g for 1 min.\nPerform real-time PCR (an example of primers and cycling conditions used here can be found in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively).\n\tNOTE: ChIP-qPCR data analysis: ChIP signals are calculated as the percent of the input. Briefly, once Ct values are obtained for each qPCR reaction, a dilution factor of 100 or 6.644 cycles (log2 of 100) is applied to the Ct values obtained for the input DNA reactions. Then, for a given region of interest (i.e., primer pair), the ChIP signals are calculated as follows:\n\tAdjusted input = Ct (Input) - 6.644\n\tChIP signal = 100 x POWER(2;average of adjusted Input-Ct value ChIP sample)\n10. ChIP-seq Library Preparation; End Repair: Day 4\nDilute up to 100 ng of ChIP-DNA in 60 µL of elution buffer (see the Materials Table).\nAdd 40 μL of end repair mix and pipette gently 10 times. \nIncubate at 30 °C for 30 min on a thermal cycler.\nVortex the magnetic beads and add 160 μL to the tube containing the end repair mix. Mix thoroughly by pipetting 10 times. Incubate 15 min at room temperature .\nPlace the tube into the magnetic holder and wait for the beads to settle on the side of the tube..\nPour off the clear liquid.\nWhile keeping the tube on the magnetic holder, add 200 μL of freshly prepared 80% EtOH.\nIncubate at room temperature for 30 s and discard the supernatant. Repeat once..\nKeep the tube for 15 min on the magnetic holder at room temperature. Once the pellet is dry, remove the tube from the magnetic holder.\nResuspend the pellet in 20 μL of resuspension buffer. Gently pipette 10 times to mix thoroughly.",
    "Incubate for 2 min at room temperature.\nPlace the tube into the magnetic holder and wait for the beads to settle on the side of the tube . Transfer 17.5 μL of the supernatant to a new tube.\n11. ChIP-seq Library Preparation; Adenylate 3' Ends\nAdd 12.5 μL of A-tailing mix to the new tube and  mix thoroughly by gently pipetting up and down 10 times.

Spin down and then vortex on maximum speed for 5 s. Spin down to position the sample at the bottom of the tube.\nLoad the samples into the quality-control system.",
    "Once the run is complete, analyze the results by setting the contrast at the maximum value to make sure no primer dimers are present in the sample (Figure 5); primer dimers should correspond at a band around 135 bp. If even a weak band is present, proceed to a second clean-up by adding elution buffer (see the Materials Table) up to a 50 µL volume and add 47.5 µL of the mixed magnetic beads. If the concentration of the sample is too low (<2 nM), proceed to run the PCR (step 13.1), using 18 cycles instead of 15, with the 12.5-µL volume of sample left from step 12.16.\nQuantify the libraries individually by qPCR using commercially available kits.\n\tNOTE: Pools of libraries can be sequenced using a sequencer with a single-read of 1 x 50 nt protocol aiming at 30 M reads/sample.\nSubscription Required.
