    "1. Preparation of Cells, Media, and Reagents\nPreparation of Methylcellulose-containing Medium\n\t\nDissolve 1.5 g of methylcellulose in 100 ml of sterile Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (no additives) in a 250 ml flask.\nHeat the solution on low in a microwave for 5 min; take care to avoid boiling over.\nOnce the methylcellulose powder is semi-dissolved, add a clean magnetic stirrer and media to take the volume to 125 ml.\nMix, invert, and stir at room temperature for 1.5 hr, followed by stirring at 4 °C overnight.\nDivide the solution equally into four 50 ml tubes and centrifuge for 1.5 hr at 2,300 x g.\nCollect the clear, highly viscous supernatant (approximately 90-95% of stock), aliquot into sterile 50 ml tubes, and store at 4 °C for up to 3 months.\nCulture and Labeling of Cells\n\t\nMaintain ovarian cancer cell lines in monolayer in a tissue culture incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in appropriate growth media (DMEM for the KGN cells17 and MCBD110:M199 for the OVCA429 and OVCA433 cell lines18) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.\nMaintain LP9 human mesothelial cells in M199:Hams F12 media containing 15% FBS, 10 ng/ml Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) and 400 ng/ml hydrocortisone, in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nSeed cells in the desired flask size and grow to approximately 75% confluency. Harvest cells by trypsinization using 0.05% trypsin/EDTA, spin at 186 x g for 5 min, and wash cell pellet twice with PBS.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer.\nOptional Fluorescent Cell Labeling Method\n\t\nResuspend cancer cells at a final concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml in 1 ml of prewarmed PBS/0.1% BSA.",
    "Add 2 μl of 5 mM stock Cell Trace CSFE solution (or other preferred cell label which is retained long-term) to cells at a final concentration of 10 μM and incubate at 37 °C for 10-15 min in a waterbath.\nQuench the reaction with 1 ml of ice cold medium containing 10% FBS and re-pellet by centrifugation. Resuspend in 10 ml of the appropriate prewarmed growth medium (see Step 1.2.1).\nSeed cells into a 75 cm2 filter-capped flask and culture at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nCheck cells under a fluorescence microscope to verify that the level of fluorescence labeling is adequate for detection. Once cells reach approximately 75% confluency, harvest and count as in steps 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 above.\n2. Generation of Spheroids in Methylcellulose\nCalculate the volume of ovarian cancer cells from Section 1 needed for spheroid generation (a total of 300,000 cells are required for each full 96-well plate experiment). Note: if using different cell lines than presented here, cell densities for uniform spheroid generation may need to be optimized for each line.\nTo calculate dilution of cells in methylcellulose media, firstly subtract the cell volume required (step 2.1) from 15 ml.\nAdd 3 ml of methylcellulose stock solution (to make 20% methylcellulose final) to a volume of culture medium appropriate for each cell line, equal to 15 ml minus the cell volume and mix thoroughly by gentle inversion.\nAdd 300,000 cells to the methylcellulose containing medium and mixed thoroughly by gentle inversion.\nPipette 150 μl of the cell/methylcellulose/media mix (for a total of 3,000 cells/well) into each well of a 96-well concave bottom culture plate and culture at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 1-4 days or until uniform spheroids form (1 spheroid/well is typically observed).\n3. RTCA Cell Invasion Assays",
    "NOTE: Impedance readings are expressed as Cell Index (CI), a dimensionless parameter which is a relative change in measured cell impedance representing the cell status. For analysis, import data into a spreadsheet, such as Microsoft Excel.\nPlate Preparation\n\t\nWorking in groups of 4 wells at a time, add 50 μl matrix (diluted 1:10 in serum-free culture media) to each well of the upper chamber of a 16-well RTCA CIM plate to ensure that the total surface area is covered. Remove 30 μl of matrix immediately, but slowly, to get rid of any excess fluid.\nIncubate plate at 37 °C for 4 hr prior to use in a tissue culture incubator.\nAdd 30 μl of the serum-free medium (SFM) appropriate for each cancer cell line to the upper chamber and 160 μl of media with or without serum (as per your experimental design) to the lower chamber.\nAssemble the CIM plate by clicking the lower chamber into the upper chamber and equilibrate in a 37 °C incubator for 1 hr in a tissue culture incubator.\nProgramming the RTCA Instrument\n\t\nOpen the RTCA program and select the ’Layout’ tab. Highlight all experimental wells.\nRight click on wells and select 'Turn on wells'; then fill in experimental conditions and cell names as desired.\nTo add steps or substeps to the program, select the ’Schedule’ tab and right click on ‘Add a step’. The first step is a preprogrammed background sweep, which is automatically incorporated into the program once ‘add a step’ is chosen.",
    "Enter the desired program details for Step 2 of the RTCA program, which will record readings during the establishment of the LP9 monolayer. Add the time intervals between impedance readings by selecting the ‘Interval’ tab and entering ‘15 min’. Add experimental duration by selecting the ‘Duration’ tab and entering a time between 12-24 hr.\nTo add subsequent steps, select the ’Schedule’ tab and right click on ‘Add a step’ and enter details of the additional steps, as above. Step 3 of the RTCA program will direct the instrument to take readings during spheroid invasion; enter ‘5 min’ under the ‘Interval’ tab and ’48 hr’ under the ‘Duration’ tab.\nSelect ’Plate’ on the menu bar and save.\nGeneration of LP9 Monolayer and Measurement of Spheroid Invasion\n\t\nPlace CIM plate in RTCA instrument and open program from Step 3.2 above. Prior to adding cells, select ’Execute’ in the menu bar and then ‘Start’. A background sweep will automatically be performed (Step 1 in the RTCA software instructions).\nRemove the CIM plate from the instrument following the background sweep and place in a tissue culture hood.\nPlate 50,000 LP9 cells suspended in 160 μl SFM into the upper chamber of each CIM plate well.\nPlace the plate in the RTCA instrument and take readings every 15 min while the LP9 monolayer is establishing overnight (Step 2 of the RTCA program).\nHarvest cancer spheroids generated under Step 2 ‘Generation of spheroids in methylcellulose’, above.\n\t\t\nAseptically, cut 1 mm off the top of a 1 ml pipette tip and use to gently retrieve the contents of each well. Transfer to a sterile tube.\nCentrifuge spheroids at 120 x g for 8 min, and remove methylcellulose containing medium by gentle aspiration.",
    "Wash spheroids twice more with PBS, centrifuging at 120 x g for 8 min to pellet spheroids after each wash.\nFor each experimental well, resuspend a total of 10 spheroids in 160 μl of medium without FBS.\nPause the RTCA experiment by selecting ‘Execute’ from the menu bar and checking ‘Pause’. Remove the CIM plate from the instrument, and place in a tissue culture hood. Aspirate off the media from each well and replace with spheroid-containing media (10 spheres in 160 μl) or fresh media for LP9-only control wells.\nReturn the plate to the RTCA instrument. Select ‘Execute’ from the menu bar and check ’Abort step’. The program will move to the next step automatically. To resume the experiment, select ‘Execute’ from the menu bar and check ‘Start/Continue’. Step 3 in the RTCA program will initiate.\nData Analysis\n\t\nTo determine the level of spheroid cell invasiveness, subtract the values obtained for the LP9 monolayer only from the individual readings obtained for the ovarian cancer cell lines at each timepoint.\nTo plot 'spheroid invasion', normalize all values to the time point at which the spheroids were added to the plate, by setting that time point to '0'."
