Representative images of collecting bone and bone marrow\n            \n(A and B) Mouse dissection and collection of arm and leg.\n(C and D) Removal of skin from leg (C) and arm (D).\n(E) Cleaned bones after the removal of muscles and tendons.\n              (F and G) Collection of bone marrow (from tibia) after cutting the\n              epiphyses. The collection of the bone marrow should be in 1.5 mL\n              tube. Shown here is a microplate for visualization purpose.\n            \nCritical: Sterility is crucial; entire\n      hood and materials that you work with should be clean.\n    \nNote: The cleaned bones should not contain\n      any residue of muscle, tendons, or skin.\n    \nPut each cleaned bone in individual well of the 12 well plate.\nRepeat the process for each mouse.\nNote: 3 mice would provide enough cells to\n      plan an experiment with multiple conditions. Pooling 3 different animals\n      increases reproducibility between experiments.\n    \n        Once all bones are collected and cleaned, cut the epiphyses of the bones\n        with a small scissors.\n      \n        Flush the bone marrow several times with a 1 mL syringe with 25G needle\n        in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube with 1 mL basal medium, until the bone",
    "becomes completely devoid of bone marrow (the bone becomes white) (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F and 2G).\n      \nNote: For each bone, use 1 mL of medium\n      for collecting the bone marrow in different Eppendorf tubes.\n    \n        Place the bone back in a clean well of the 12-well plate containing\n        basal medium and follow the osteoblast culture protocol (see Part 2).\n      \n        Keep the bone marrow-containing Eppendorf tubes for osteoclast culture\n        protocol (see Part 3).\n      \nPart 2: Osteoblast culture protocol\nTiming: 2–3 h for initial culture\n      preparation, minimum 2 weeks for cell passages and up to 14-–21 days more\n      once the treatment has started.\n    \n        Flush the bones at least four times with basal medium in the 12-well\n        plate to clean the bone from other cells. The bone should look clear\n        from any residual bone marrow or attached muscle cells. Move the bone to\n        a new clean well filled with basal medium and flush one last time to\n        remove any unwanted residual cells.\n      \nNote: Using several wells of the 12-well\n      plate ensures sterility and decreases the risks of other cell type\n      contamination. This is an important step to avoid contamination of other\n      cell types in the osteoblast culture.\n    \n        Prepare Digestion medium freshly as described in\n        material and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section.\n      \n        Cut each bone with sterile scissors into small pieces with a length of\n        1 mm and put them into a 25 cm2 flask containing 6 mL\n        digestion medium. All the bones from one mouse can be pooled in one\n        flask, leaving 3 flasks at the end of this step.\n      \nNote: Too big bone pieces might reduce the\n      migration out of the osteoblasts.\n    \n        Incubate the flask for 90 min at 37°C with mild shaking in vertical\n        position.\n      \nNote: Using a flask is required to ensure\n      sterility of the preparation.\n    \n        Aspirate the digestion medium containing collagenase, keeping the bone",
    "pieces in the flask. Discard the medium containing unwanted digested\n        cells.\n      \n        Rinse the flask with 10 mL basal medium and discard the medium, keeping\n        the bone pieces in the flask. Repeat this step 2 times.\n      \n        Add 6 mL basal medium to the flask with bone pieces and incubate the\n        cells to spread and proliferate at 37°C 5% CO2 for\n        3–4 days. The cells will migrate from the bone pieces to attach\n        to the flask and start proliferating (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\n        \nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/588-Fig3.jpg\n              Figure 3.

If this is\n      the case, wait for each flask to reach 70%–80% confluence and\n      passage them independently.\n    \n        Osteoblast passage protocol:\n        \nTiming: 30 min –1 h for preparation\n          of passaging preparation.

It will mainly help to weaken the\n              extracellular matrix.\n            \n            Add 5 mL basal medium to stop the digestion and collect the medium\n            completely in a 50 mL falcon tube.

Flush the flask several times to detach the cells and\n            collect the medium in a 50 mL falcon-tube that is used in step 22c.\n          \nNote: It is normal that some cells will stay attached to the\n            flask (strongly), they are mostly dendritic cells and should not be\n            taken.\n          \nCentrifuge at 178 × g for 8 min at 4°C.\n            During the centrifugation, use a 5 mL serological pipette with a cut\n            tip to enlarge the aspirating end, and collect the remaining pieces\n            of bones with 5 mL basal medium. Transfer it all to a new 75 cm2\n            flask.\n          \n            At the end of the centrifugation, aspirate and discard the\n            supernatant from the cells and resuspend them in 15 mL basal medium.\n          \n            Transfer all the cells to the respective new 75 cm2\n            flasks. Be sure that the bone pieces are evenly spread through the\n            flasks before incubating at 37°C.\n          \n            Let the cells to grow (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B), until they\n            reach 90% confluence.

Arrows\n                  indicate multinucleation of the osteoclasts.\n                \nFor a 6-well plate: 4 × 105 cells/well in\n            2 mL medium (2 × 105cells/mL or 4.2\n            × 104 cells/cm2).\nFor a 12-well plate: 1 × 105 cells/well in\n            1 mL medium (2.6 × 104cells/cm2).\n          \n            After 48 h, change the medium and initiate the differentiation using\n            the osteoclast differentiation medium (See\n            material and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]\n            section).\nImportant: If you want to check the effect of treatment on\n            osteoclast differentiation, start supplementing the differentiation\n            medium with the appropriate treatment.\n          \n            Check the cells every day to follow the differentiation process (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B–4D)\n            \nCritical: It is important to\n              follow the differentiation process every day. Indeed,\n              differentiated osteoclasts (big multinucleated cells) cannot be\n              cultured very long, therefore after the differentiation happened,",
    "no more than 1 or 2 days of culture can be extended; otherwise,\n              the cells will burst and die. (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E\n              as an example of this process).\n            \n            Change the osteoclast differentiation medium every 4 days.\n            \nNote: If the medium is changed\n              more frequently, the differentiation may not occur.\n            \n            If the effect of the treatment needs to be assessed on\n            differentiated osteoclasts, wait until the osteoclasts are\n            differentiated (big multinucleated cells), and add your treatment\n            for 1 or 2 days before stopping the cell culture.\n            \nCritical: Be sure you started\n              your treatment at the correct timing as the differentiated\n              osteoclasts could die very fast. Therefore, after the\n              differentiation happened, no more than 1 or 2 days of treatment\n              can be applied. Stop the experiment and perform the different\n              protocols to assess the osteoclasts differentiation.\n            \nNote: For characterization of\n              osteoclasts, RNA collection (see step 34) and TRAP staining (see\n              step 35) can be performed.\n            \nPart 4: Analysis of osteoblasts\n        RNA Extraction (6-well plate)\n        \n            Aspirate the medium from the cells when they are at day 7 of\n            differentiation.
