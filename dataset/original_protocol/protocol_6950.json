    "Sample preparationDissect the samples using a dissecting microscope with forceps and razor blades. This step can be omitted for cell cultures.Prepare the fixation buffer immediately prior to dissection. Place the dissected samples in an adequate amount of fixation buffer in 20-ml glass scintillation vials at room temperature. The volume of the fixative needs to be at least 15 times the volume of the sample.For plant samples, vacuum-infiltrate the samples (without the vial cap) for 15 min at 0.1 mPa in a vacuum bell jar. Repeat this step at least 3 times until the samples completely sink to the bottom of the fixation buffer.Store the fixed samples overnight at 4°C in fixation buffer. Samples can be stored at 4°C in fixation buffer for up to one week before embedding.Wash off the fixation buffer by incubating the samples in PBS (1×) buffer 3 times for 20 min each.Dehydrate the samples by incubation in an ethanol series of 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% for 30 min each.Incubate the samples in 75% ethanol/25% histoclear, 50% ethanol/50% histoclear, and 25% ethanol/75% histoclear solution for 1 h each.Wash the samples 3 times in 100% histoclear for 1 h each.Add 5 ml fresh histoclear to the sample and then add paraplast to fill the jar. Incubate at 58°C overnight.The next day, add fresh paraplast to fill the jar. Repeat this step every hour until the melted wax fills up the jar.Wash the sample with freshly melted wax every 3 h. Repeat this step 3 times.Transfer the paraffin-embedded sample to the processing cassettes in the right orientation for sectioning.Cool the samples at room temperature. Store embedded samples at 4°C. Samples can be stored for up to 6 months.Section the samples using a paraffin microtome. The suggested section thickness is 6-10 µm.",
    "Transfer 1-2 sections carefully to the center of a gold fiducial-labeled coverglass using a paintbrush.Completely dry the samples by leaving the coverglass at 37°C for 2 days.Probe designVARNISH (Vetting and Analysis of RNA for in situ Hybridization) probes are designed automatically on our sRNA-PAINT probe design website hosted at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center server: https://wasabi.ddpsc.org/~apps/varnish/[href=https://wasabi.ddpsc.org/~apps/varnish/].Enter the sRNA target sequence in the “Paste your small RNA sequence” field. Input the desired salt concentration and hybridization temperature (or use the default settings).Enter or select the docking strand from the docking strand dropdown menu.Enter or select the linker sequence.The results of the probe design will be sent to you via email with a link for ordering.In situ hybridization and washesDeparaffinize the samples twice by incubation in 100% histoclear for 10 min each.Rehydrate the samples by immersing the slides in an ethanol series of 100%, 95%, 80%, 70%, 50%, 30%, 10% (vol/vol), and water for 1 min each.Incubate the slides in 250 ml protease solution at 37°C for 20 min.Neutralize the samples in 250 ml 0.2% glycine solution for 20 min at room temperature.Wash the slides twice in PBS (1×) buffer for 2 min each.Dehydrate the samples by immersing the slides in water and ethanol series of 10%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 95%, and 100% for 1 min each.Immerse the slides in 100% ethanol for an additional 1 min.Store the samples in fresh 100% ethanol at 4°C for at least 4 h. Slides can be stored at 4°C for 1 week.Add 1 µl 250 µM probe to 9 µl water and 10 µl formamide. Heat denature at 90°C for 3 min and immediately chill on ice.Add 80 µl hybridization buffer to the solution mix in Step C9. Mix gently by pipetting without causing bubbles.",
    "Apply 100 µl probe mix to the sample slide and cover with hybridization membrane. Alternatively, simply place the slide (sample side down) on a wet paper towel that has been covered with a layer of parafilm such that the sample side touches the parafilm (Figure 1). Avoid bubbles during this step.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4128/bioprotoc-11-16-4128-g001.jpgFigure 1. Assembly of the sRNA-PAINT hybridization chamber Place the slide in a moist chamber and seal with plastic wrap. A simple moist chamber can be made by placing a sheet of parafilm on top of a wet paper towel in a flat-bottomed container.Hybridize at 53°C overnight (or at least 16 h).Pre-heat 0.2× SSC buffer to the same hybridization temperature as in Step C13.After hybridization, wash the samples twice with 0.2× SSC for 1 h each.Wash the samples in TBS (1×) buffer for 5 min at room temperature.To immobilize the hybridized probes, incubate the slides twice in freshly prepared EDC buffer at room temperature for 10 min each.Immerse the slides in EDC solution for 1 h and 15 min at room temperature.Neutralize the slides in 0.2% glycine solution for 30 min.Wash the slides twice in TBS (1×) buffer for 10 min each.Store the slides at 4°C in TBS (1×) buffer until imaging.sRNA-PAINT imagingSecure one slide on the imaging perfusion chamber with the sample side facing up (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4128/bioprotoc-11-16-4128-g002.jpgFigure 2. Assembly of the sRNA-PAINT imaging system. A. System for buffer storage and perfusion. B. Multiple tubes connect the perfusion unit to the imaging chamber. C. Imaging chamber setup for buffer exchange during image acquisition.Start the perfusion system and adjust the perfusion rate so that at least 2 ml imager solution is perfused through the sample during a 20-min imaging acquisition time.",
    "Image the sample on a microscope capable of total internal fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) fitted with a 63× or 100× objective that is compatible with TIRFM. Use a 100-200 ms camera exposure time and collect about 10,000-20,000 frames for each imager strand. Save the images in a format that can be opened with Bio-Formats.Switch the perfusion input to buffer C and wash off the imager strand.Image the sample under the same conditions as in Step D3 to collect a buffer control image.Switch the perfusion input to a non-specific imager strand.Image the sample under the same conditions as Step D3 to collect a non-specific imager strand control image."
