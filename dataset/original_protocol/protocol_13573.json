    "NOTE: Workflow for the detection of biomarkers for sperm function damage by flow cytometry includes (1) cell preparation, (2) staining with fluorescent reagents, and (3) flow cytometric analysis and data interpretation (Figure 1). The protocol follows the guidelines of the Ethics Committees of the Army Medical University (1.0/2013.4-12).\n1. Cell preparation\nObtain human semen samples by masturbation in plastic clinical specimen jars, preferably after 3-5 days of abstinence.\nImmediately incubate the semen samples in a 37 °C incubator and completely liquefy the samples (up to 1 h).\n2. Sperm cells counted using computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA)\nMix the liquefied semen samples thoroughly.\nAdd 10 µL of semen into a sperm counting chamber (see the Table of Materials).\nScan the slides in the Sperm Class Analyzer (see the Table of Materials), and count at least six areas and 400 spermatozoa for the estimation of sperm concentration.\n\t​NOTE: Semen samples must be fresh, not frozen, for sperm apoptosis and MMP analysis.\n3. Staining sperm cells\nDetection of sperm apoptosis using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining\n\t\nAdd 1 × 106 sperm cells to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube.\nWash the cells with 500 µL of cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nCentrifuge the sperm cell suspension at 300 × g for 7 min and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the sperm cells in 200 µL of 1x Binding Buffer.\nAdd 2 µL of FITC Annexin V and 2 µL of PI (see the Table of Materials).\nGently vortex the cells, incubate for 15 min at room temperature (25 °C) in the dark, and place them in the flow cytometer immediately for analysis.\nAnalysis of mitochondrial membrane potential using JC-1 probe\n\t\nAdd 2 × 106 sperm cells to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min.",
    "Resuspend the sperm cell suspension in 1 mL of JC-1 working solution (see the Table of Materials).\nGently vortex the cells and incubate for 20 min at 37 °C in the dark.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 600 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant.\nWash the pellet twice with 1 mL of PBS at a speed of 600 × g for 5 min each.\nResuspend the dyed sperm cells in 1 mL of PBS in flow cytometer tubes, and place the tubes in the flow cytometer immediately for analysis.\nUse carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP) as a positive control. Resuspend the sperm cells (as previously described in step 3.2.1) in 1 mL of CCCP working solution (see the Table of Materials), and gently vortex the cells and incubate for 20 min at room temperature. Centrifuge the suspension at 600 × g for 5 min and discard the supernatant. Repeat steps 3.2.2-3.2.6.\nSperm chromatin structure assay\n\t\nPlace an aliquot of liquefied raw semen (0.25 mL) into a cryotube, and immediately freeze the semen samples in liquid nitrogen (-196 °C) until ready for the SCSA.\nThaw the semen samples in a 37 °C water bath and dilute them with TNE buffer (see the Table of Materials) to a concentration of 1-2 × 106 cells/mL.\nAdd 200 µL of the diluted sample to a flow cytometer test tube and mix it with 400 µL of acid solution (see the Table of Materials) for 30 s.\nStain the samples with 1.2 mL of AO staining solution (see the Table of Materials) and place in the flow cytometer immediately for analysis.",
    "Use a reference sample as an internal standard to flow cytometer set-up and calibrations. Dilute the reference sample with 4 °C TNE buffer to a concentration of 1-2 × 106 cells/mL. Repeat steps 3.3.1-3.3.4.\n\t\tNOTES: All solutions and buffers are stored at 4 °C. (1) The semen should not be diluted before flash freezing. Raw semen samples should be thawed and diluted with TNE buffer at the time of flow cytometry measurements. (2) For infertility clinics, ~0.25 mL of raw semen should be flash-frozen in an ultracold freezer or a LN2 tank. These frozen aliquots can then be sent to an SCSA diagnostic laboratory on dry ice or in a LN2 dry shipper. (3) A human ejaculate sample that demonstrates heterogeneity of DNA integrity (e.g., 15% DNA fragmentation index [DFI]) was used as an internal standard reference.\n4. Flow cytometer setup\nNOTE: Before starting the flow cytometer, the instrument's system check should be performed to verify analytical performance. Run the samples after all checks have been completed and passed.\nOpen the flow cytometer software and start the cytometer.\nCollect sample data.\n\t\nFirst, load a control sample onto the flow cytometer, and click RUN to start data collection (adjust settings if needed). Wait for the instrument to begin aspirating the sample and provide a real-time preview of detected events.\n\t\tNOTE: The control sample: a negative control (unstained sperm cells) for sperm apoptosis; a positive control (CCCP-treated cells) for MMP; a reference sample for SCSA.\nCreate dot plots for viewing data and select the x/y-axis parameters (such as FSC, SSC) and linear to specify data are displayed. Select and apply a polygonal gate to delineate the sperm population for analysis, and so that the instrument plots detected events in real-time.\nAnalyze the sperm events within the region.",
    "For sperm apoptosis, set the FL1 as the x-axis and the FL2 as the x-axis. To isolate the live, apoptotic, or necrotic cells, tap and drag the quadrant gate to subset the sperm populations down to four specific populations.\nFor MMP, set the FL1 as the x-axis and the FL2 as the y-axis. Create a polygonal gate to subset the sperm populations down to two specific populations.\nFor SCSA, set the FL4 as the x-axis (red fluorescence, 125/1,024 flow cytometry channels) and the FL1 as the y-axis (green fluorescence, 475/1,024 flow cytometry channels). Draw the gates at a 45° angle to exclude cellular debris signals.\nSet a run limit to indicate when to stop collecting data. Calculate a total of 10,000 sperm cells for each sample for sperm apoptosis, MMP, and SCSA analyses.\nSet the fluidics rate (slow, medium, and fast, or a custom fluidics rate), depending on the cell numbers.\n\t\tNOTES: For SCSA analysis, to determine sperm concentrations, thaw the frozen raw sample and run it on the FCM. If the flow rate is >250/s, dilute the sample to the correct flow rate. Measure all samples independently twice, and calculate the mean values. A reference sample was tested when every 10-15 samples were measured to ensure standardization and stability of the instrument from day-to-day.\nSet the threshold to eliminate debris and noise from cell samples. Apply these settings for all samples in the experiment.\nIf needed, set the color compensation to correct fluorescence spillover.\nGently back-pipette the samples before loading them onto the flow cytometer, name the sample, and run the samples.\nOnce all samples have been run, save the sample data as FCS files by giving them a file name for further software analysis. Save the work template of the current experiment for retrieval in future runs (optional).",
    "5. Data analysis\nImport the data into the data analysis software for the flow cytometer (see the Table of Materials).\nDouble-click the first sample in workspace. Wait until a Graph window opens, showing a plot of events along FSC versus SSC parameters. Create a gate that isolates the sperm population included within the gate, producing a 'child' population from the parent set of events.\nDouble-click within the gated area, and open a new Graph window containing only the sperm events. Set the x- and y-axis parameters to select fluorescent channel.\nSelect the Gate tool. Click within the plot to make the gates appear, so that the created gates isolate the different cell populations.\nRight-click (or control-click) any of the highlighted rows, and select Copy analysis to group. Apply the gating tree to all samples within the group.\nSave and export the data table."
