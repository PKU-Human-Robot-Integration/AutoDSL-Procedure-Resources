The use of the human material was in full compliance with the university policy for use of cadavers and recognizable body parts, Institute of Anatomy, University of Erlangen.\n1. Harvest the flexor tendons\nHarvesting the flexor digitorum profundus\n\t\nPlace a fresh cadaveric upper limb on the dissecting table with the ventral-palmar side facing the surgeon. Use a standard hand fixation device to keep the phalanges in the extension.\nNote the age and the gender of the deceased.\nUsing a No. 15 scalpel, place a median longitudinal incision at the index finger on the palmar side beginning from the distal phalanx distally toward the A1 pulley22 over the metacarpophalangeal joint22.\nSever the A1 and A2 pulleys22 longitudinally without injuring the flexor tendons. Sever the flexor digitorum profundus22 at the level of the distal interphalangeal joint using a scalpel.\nUse the band of a surgical lap sponge to set the tendon under traction and retrieve the flexor digitorum profundus at the level of the A1 pulley.\nMake a 6 cm transversal incision on the rascetta crease22 using a No. 15 scalpel.\nMake another transversal incision 10 cm proximal to the rascetta.\nNow make a longitudinal incision at the median of the palmar side of the forearm, connecting the two aforementioned transversal incisions.\nDevelop two opposing skin flaps at the level of the forearm fascia to expose the flexor tendons. The flexor tendons are readily identifiable under the skin.\nAgain, use the band of a surgical lap sponge to place the flexor digitorum tendon under traction and retract the tendon proximal to the wrist.\nNow, sever the tendon at the musculotendinous junction for maximal tendon length by using a No. 11 scalpel.",
    "Place the tendon specimen into 500 mL of 0.9% saline solution.\nRepeat steps 1.1.1 to 1.1.12 for the third to fifth fingers.\nHarvesting of the flexor digitorum superficialis\n\t\nSever the tendon of the flexor digitorum superficialis of the index finger proximal to the wrist at the tendino-muscular junction, where the whitish tendon changes into brownish muscle tissue.\nNow use the band of a surgical lap sponge to retract the tendon at the site of the A1 pulley of the index finger.\nSever the vinculae22 of the tendons in the palm.\nRetract the flexor digitorum superficialis22 distally to the proximal interphalangeal joint.\nUse a No. 15 scalpel to sever the flexor digitorum superficialis at the chiasma, just at the proximal interphalangeal joint22.\nPlace the tendon specimen into 500 mL of 0.9% saline solution.\nRepeat step 1.2.1 to 1.2.6 for the third to fifth fingers.\nHarvesting of the flexor pollicis longus22\nUse a No. 15 scalpel to make a 9 cm longitudinal median incision at the palmar side of the thumb from the distal phalanx until the A1 pulley.\nIncise longitudinally the A1 and A2 pulleys.\nExpose the flexor tendon of the thumb, and by using a No. 15 scalpel sever the tendon at its insertion over the base of the distal phalanx.\nUsing of the band of a surgical lap sponge, retract the tendon at the level of the A1 pulley.\nAt the surgical site proximal to the wrist, find the flexor pollicis longus tendon at the radial-most corner of the flexor compartment and retract it with a band of a surgical lap sponge.\nSever the tendon at the musculotendinous junction.\nPlace the tendon specimen into 500 mL of 0.9% saline solution.\n2. Transection of the tendon (Figure 1)",
    "Fix the tendon specimen on an expanded polystyrene plate with pins or 18 G cannulas.\nTransect the tendon in the middle using a scalpel with a No. 11 blade.\n\tâ€‹NOTE: Do not transect the tendon twice or the length will not be sufficient for stable mounting onto the servohydraulic measuring machine.\n3. Tendon repair\nKirchmayr-Kessler two-strand core repair with the Zechner and Pennington modifications18,19 (Figure 2)\n\t\nUse a No. 11 blade and make a 5 mm stab incision in the midline of the right-handed part of the tendon, approximately 1.5 cm from the stump (i.e., the site of the severed tendon).\nThrough this incision insert the sharp round needle of the suture and exit at the side of the tendon on the same level toward the surgeon. This pass of the needle needs to be on the superficial plane.\nNow insert the needle at the surface of the tendon approximately 3 mm further to the right and dive into the deep plane.\nExit at the stump and insert the needle at the exact opposite side at the left-handed part of the tendon.\nEmerge at the surface of the tendon, at the side nearest to the surgeon, approximately 1.8 cm from the stump.\nNow enter the side of the tendon 3 mm toward the stump and follow a path transversely to the tendon. Exit at the side opposite to the surgeon.\nEnter the surface of the tendon 3 mm further from the stump and follow a deep plane exiting at the left stump.\nEnter the right stump and follow a longitudinal deep plane until exiting at the surface of the tendon approximately 1.8 cm from the stump.\nInsert the needle at the far side of the tendon, at the level of the initial stab incision. Emerge from the stab incision.",
    "Tie a surgical knot with eight throws, alternating the direction manually23.\nAdelaide cross-lock four-strand core repair11,19 (Figure 2)\n\t\nInsert the needle into the left stump of the transected tendon. Follow the path of the tendon on the surgeon's side for 1.5 cm and exit at the surface of the tendon. Insert the needle 3 mm to the left and take a bite of 3 mm, exiting toward the surgeon.\nInsert the needle 3 mm to the right, next to the exit point of the first path and follow the tendon to the very side until the left stump. Insert the needle into the right stump in a path at the very outer part of the tendon. Exit approximately 1.5 cm to the right of the stump.\nNow insert the needle again at 3 mm to the right and take a grasp, exiting at the side of the tendon.\nInsert the needle back toward the right stump, entering approximately 3 mm to the left. Exit at the right stump and enter again into the left stump for 1.5 cm. Grasp a portion of the tendon of 3 mm with the suture and exit near the midline.\nReinsert the needle 3 mm nearer to the stump and follow the direction of the tendon to the right, making sure to exit at the stump.\nInsert the needle into the right stump and follow the tendon fibers approximately 1.5 cm to the right. Exit at the surface.\nRe-enter the tendon further to the right (3 mm) and take a grasp, aiming to the far side. Insert the needle 3 mm to the left and follow the tendon exiting at the stump. Now tie a surgical knot with eight throws, alternating the direction manually.\nM-Tang six-strand core repair11 (Figure 2)",
    "Insert the needle of the loop approximately 1.5 cm from the right stump of the tendon and grasp a portion of the tendon of approximately 3 mm in size.\nPass the needle through the loop and insert the needle into the surface of the tendon.\nFollow the path of the tendon and exit between the stumps.\nReinsert the needle into the opposite stump and follow the tendon in the deep plane for 1.8 cm.

Uniaxial tensile test\nSet up the tensile testing machine",
    "Mount the load cell on the upper crosshead of the standard tensile testing system using the connection system and respective bolts.\nMount the specimen grips on the lower part, moving the crosshead and the load cell using the connection system and respective bolts.\nSwitch on the control computer and open the testing software. Wait for the initialization of the tensile testing machine. Click on File > Open and then choose the Zwick test program Simple Tensile Test for Fmax determination. Then click ok.\nSet up the current specimen grip distance by clicking on Machine > Setup. Measure the specimen grip distance using a caliper and write the value in Current tool separation/Current grip to grip separation and click ok.\nSet up the measurement sequence by clicking Wizard. Go to Pre-test and set the grip to grip separation at the start position to 20 cm. Then, tick Pre-load and set the pre-load to 0.50 N. Go to Test parameters and set the Test speed to 300 mm/min. Click on Series Layout to finish the setup process.\nClick Start position to set the grip separation to the start position.\nMounting and testing of the repaired tendon\n\t\nClick Force 0 in the testing software directly before the sample mounting.\nTransfer the repaired tendon immediately after repair to the tensile testing machine (Figure 3 and Figure 4) using forceps.\nInsert coarse paper between the specimen grips and the tendon to increase friction during the specimen testing. Close the specimen grips hand-tight and stress-free.\nClick Start to initiate the measurement sequence. The linear traction force is documented by the dedicated testing software. Document the maximum force prior to failure.\nInspect the construct visually and document the sample photographically with any commercial camera. Define the mode of failure based on the subsequent classifications:",
    "Slippage: The loops of the suture material slip through the tendon and the suture pulls out.\nKnot failure: The knot fails and unties.\nBreak: Rupture of suture.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Taking a photo of the failed specimen is just for qualitative purposes, not for a measurement, and therefore it does not have to be in a standardized way. For example, no standard light or distance.\nExport raw data (force-displacement-data) in the form of a Table (.xls file) for graphic representation. Summarize the results in a table of values expressed in Newton (N).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
