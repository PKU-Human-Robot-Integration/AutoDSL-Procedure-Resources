    "1. Fabrication of negative pattern polyimide-based stencils\nGenerate a pattern (Figure 2A) in .dxf format using computer-aided design software (e.g., AutoCAD, SolidWorks, Onshape, Adobe Illustrator).\n\t\nGenerate a circle (diameter = 22 mm) to delineate the border of the stencil.\nDraw a solid-filled shape or the pattern desired.\nInclude a chiral letter (e.g., R) to mark the front side of the stencils.\n\t\tNOTE: As an example, an array of squares and rectangles is generated to pattern iPSC-CMs at single-cell and cell-pair levels. The design files are available (see Supplemental Files). The microfabrication resolution limit is ~10 µm.\nSubmit the design to a microfabrication company to laser-cut polyimide film and fabricate stencils (Figure 2B,C).\n2. Preparation of sulfo-SANPAH aliquots\nNOTE: The protocol is modified from Fischer et al.11.\nUse a moisture-resistant cardboard sample storage box (e.g., 100 well, 10 x 10 spaces for centrifuge tubes, dimensions: 13.4 cm x 13.4 cm x 5.1 cm). Label it \"name/date/sulfo-SANPAH 40 µL/reconstituted with 1,200 µL of PBS\".\nLabel 50 microcentrifuge tubes (polypropylene, 1.5 mL) with an 'S' on the lid.\nTake 4 mL of anhydrous, extra dry dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and sterile filter the solution using a membrane filter unit (pore size = 0.22 µm) into a sterile 15 mL conical tube.\nPrepare a liquid nitrogen bath and cover with the lid to minimize the evaporation of the liquid nitrogen.\nDissolve 50 mg of sulfo-SANPAH in 2 mL of the filtered DMSO.\nVortex well to fully dissolve the sulfo-SANPAH in the DMSO.\nDistribute 40 µL aliquots of the sulfo-SANPAH solution into sterile 1.5 mL tubes.\nTransfer the tubes into the box.\nFlash-freeze the tubes in liquid nitrogen for 5 min.\nStore the aliquots at -80 °C.",
    "NOTE: The aliquots can be used for up to 6 months without diminished efficiency. The stock sulfo-SANPAH concentration is 25 mg/mL or 50.77 mM.\n3. Sterilization of tools\nAutoclave two forceps, 24 glass coverslips (22 x 22 mm, No. 1 or No. 1.5), one razor blade, and three lint-free absorbent wipes.\n\tNOTE: To make 12 hydrogel constructs, 24 glass coverslips are needed. There should be two coverslips per construct. It is advisable to prepare some spare coverslips.\nPlace two pieces of paraffin film (4 x 4 inch) in an ethanol resistant plastic box (e.g., a 1,000 µL pipette tip box) and sterilize them in fresh 70% ethanol for at least 15 min. \n4. Preparation of polyacrylamide hydrogel precursor solution\nNOTE: The protocol is modified from Lee et al.12.\nDissolve 125 mg of aminoethyl methacrylate (AEM) in 36.25 mL of deionized water in a 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube by vortexing.\nTo prepare 50 mL of 10 kPa polyacrylamide precursor solution (8–0.15–15 mM), mix 10 mL of 40% acrylamide solution, 3.75 mL of 2% bis-acrylamide solution, and 36.25 mL of the AEM solution prepared in step 4.1 in a new 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube.\n\tNOTE: The final concentration of precursor solution is 8% acrylamide, 0.15% bis-acrylamide, and 15 mM AEM, which was measured to have ~10 kPa stiffness by atomic force microscopy. According to the tissue applications of interest, the stiffness of the hydrogel can be altered by changing the ratio of the 40% acrylamide to the 2% bis-acrylamide solution. For example, 8% acrylamide–0.08% bis-acrylamide solution yields 3 kPa hydrogels; 8% acrylamide–0.48% bis-acrylamide solution yields 38 kPa hydrogels; 8% acrylamide–0.48% bis-acrylamide solution yields 60 kPa hydrogels. It is advisable to confirm the stiffness of hydrogels made from the precursor solutions with altered ratios.\n5. Preparation of photoinitiator solution",
    "For 1 mL of 5% photoinitiator solution, first dissolve 50 mg of 2-hydroxy-4’-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone powder in 700 µL of 100% ethanol in a 1.5 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube with lid.\n\tNOTE: 2-Hydroxy-4’-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone is not soluble in water. Make sure to fully dissolve the powder in ethanol by vortexing.\nAfter completely dissolving the 2-hydroxy-4’-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone in ethanol by vortexing, add 300 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for a final volume of 1 mL.\n\tNOTE: The final concentration of 2-hydroxy-4’-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone solution is 5%. The foiled 5% photoinitiator solution is good for 4 weeks at 4 °C.\n6. Preparation of basement membrane matrix protein solution\nNOTE: Basement membrane matrix (Table of Materials) is a temperature-sensitive material. Make sure to work on ice with chilled pipette tips and tubes as well as ice-cold solutions. A new stock of basement membrane matrix should be thawed slowly on ice at 4 °C overnight.\nPrepare 200 µL of basement membrane matrix protein solution per hydrogel construct. For 12 constructs, 2.4 mL of basement membrane matrix protein solution are needed. Prepare 10% extra solution (e.g., 2.6 mL).\nFor every new batch/lot of basement membrane matrix protein solution, optimize the dilution ratio. For the first time, test dilution ratios of 1:10, 1:20, 1:40 to find the dilution ratio that yields the best qualities for cell patterning.\n\tNOTE: If the basement membrane matrix protein solution is too viscous, it will form a gel on top of the stencil, and it is more likely to peel off when removing the stencil. If the protein solution is too fluid, it will penetrate through the pattern holes of the stencils, which will result in poor quality patterning.",
    "Dilute basement membrane matrix protein stock solution on ice with ice-cold Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium/Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F12) media or 1x PBS to the optimized dilution ratio above. For example, dilute 120 µL of the stock solution in 2.4 mL of DMEM/F12 media (1:20) and keep on ice for later use.\n7. Hydrogel fabrication\nPlace a UV bench lamp (365 nm, 4 mW/cm2) in a biological safety hood.\nPlace the sterilized paraffin films from step 3.2 and dry completely under sterile conditions. If the paraffin films are not completely dry, use a vacuum aspiration system to remove any residual liquid. Place six autoclaved coverslips from step 3.1 on each paraffin film using the autoclaved forceps.\nPrepare UV-crosslinkable polyacrylamide precursor solution by diluting 5% photoinitiator solution (step 5.2) with polyacrylamide precursor solution (step 4.2) in a 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube. For 5 mL of UV-crosslinkable polyacrylamide precursor solution, add 50 µL of 5% photoinitiator solution to 5 mL of polyacrylamide precursor solution.\nFilter the precursor solution from step 7.3 using a 50 mL filter unit with a 0.22 µm pore size for sterilization.\n\tNOTE: Always prepare fresh precursor solution.\nDispense 200 µL of polyacrylamide precursor solution from step 7.4 on each 22 x 22 mm glass cover slip in the paraffin filmed Petri dish and carefully cover with another 22 x 22 mm glass coverslip on top to sandwich the solution in between (Figure 3A).\n\tNOTE: Paraffin film is used to avoid spilling and to confine the precursor solution in between the coverslips.\nPlace the coverslip-containing Petri dish from step 7.5 under the UV bench lamp and photopolymerize the polyacrylamide hydrogels for 5 min (Figure 3B).",
    "NOTE: If the surface is non-white, the UV absorbance of surface reduces the photocrosslinking efficiency. The coverage of white paper on the non-white surface is important to minimize the UV intensity loss. To protect from UV radiation, cover the lamp with aluminum foil and wear UV protection goggles.\nCarefully detach one cover slip off from the other using a razor blade by leverage action (Figure 3C).\n\tNOTE: The hydrogel will usually stick to the top coverslip. Pay extra attention when detaching the coverslip from the soft hydrogel, because it is likely to break.\nFill a disposable polypropylene reservoir with PBS. Transfer the hydrogel-coverslip composites in a PBS-containing reservoir to rinse the hydrogels in PBS for 5 min. After rinsing, place the hydrogel construct back on the paraffin film in the Petri dish.\n8. Protein conjugation\nPrepare an ice bucket and precool PBS.\n\tNOTE: For six hydrogels, 1,200 µL of cold PBS is needed.\nTake out the sulfo-SANPAH aliquot (1 vial = 6 gels).\n\tNOTE: If necessary, the amount of sulfo-SANPAH used can be reduced after optimization.\nAdd 1,200 µL of cold PBS into a vial of sulfo-SANPAH aliquot and mix by pipetting up and down.\nDispense 200 µL of sulfo-SANPAH on the paraffin film in the Petri dish and cover with the hydrogel-coverslip composite with hydrogel contacting sulfo-SANPAH (Figure 3D).\n\tNOTE: Sulfo-SANPAH is very susceptible to water due to hydrolysis. Freshly thaw from -80 °C right before usage. Do not reuse or refreeze any leftovers.\nExpose the hydrogel to the UV lamp at 365 nm, 4 mW/cm2 for 5 min to activate sulfo-SANPAH.",
    "NOTE: After exposure, the sulfo-SANPAH will change from orange to brown (Figure 3E). If the hydrogel turns brown, it indicates successful activation of the phenyl azide group of sulfo-SANPAH and incorporation of sulfo-SANPAH onto the hydrogel. Directly proceed with steps 8.6−8.9 within a maximum of 10 min, because the activity of sulfo-SANPAH will decline.\nReplenish a disposable polypropylene reservoir with fresh PBS. After sulfo-SANPAH activation, transfer the activated hydrogels and quickly rinse the hydrogels in a PBS reservoir to remove unbound sulfo-SANPAH.\n\tNOTE: A long wash can result in low protein conjugation efficiency.\nAfter a quick rinse, place the hydrogel-attached coverslips on the paraffin film in the Petri dishes and carefully dab the hydrogels with sterile lint-free wipes.\n\tNOTE: The remaining PBS on top of the hydrogel will result in leakage of the basement membrane matrix protein solution through the stencil, and drying too extensively will lead to rupture of the hydrogel upon removal of the stencil due to too high adherence to the stencil.\nPlace the stencil on top of the hydrogels and dab with autoclaved lint-free wipes to ensure tight sealing between the stencil and the hydrogel (Figure 3F).\nCarefully dispense 200 µL of the diluted basement membrane matrix protein solution prepared from step 6.3 (Figure 3G) on top. Leave overnight in the incubator (37 °C).\n\tNOTE: When the stencil-hydrogel contact is tight and the basement membrane matrix protein solution concentration is optimal, the basement membrane matrix protein solution will be sequestered and remain on top of the stencil (Figure 3H). Incubation time can be reduced upon optimization. Theoretically, it can be reduced down to 30 min–2 h.\nThe next day, transfer the hydrogels to a 6 well plate and fully immerse them in PBS.",
    "NOTE: It is recommended to peel off the stencil with PBS immersion over the coverslip to prevent tearing and sticking of the hydrogel to the stencil.\nCarefully remove the stencil using autoclaved tweezers without tearing the hydrogel. Resuspend well with DMEM, return the patterned hydrogels to the incubator, and leave them overnight to test for any contamination.\nIf the media remains clear, the hydrogels are ready to be used for cell plating. Optimize the cell plating density and incubation time to allow adhesion of the cells for respective applications.\n\tNOTE: For single cell patterning of hiPSC-CMs, seed and incubate overnight. The following cell numbers are recommended for seeding: 30,000, 60,000, and 90,000 cells/well. Seeding too many cells leads to more than one cell per pattern. A cell strainer is recommended to strain out non-single cells before cell seeding.\nThe next day, observe cell attachment and spreading, and change the media to get rid of detached cells.\n9. Cleaning of the used stencils\nTo remove residual matrix proteins on the used stencils, submerge the stencils in enzyme solution (Table of Materials) for 10 min at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: The enzyme should be selected depending on the matrix proteins used. For collagen-rich matrix protein solution, use collagenase. A 10–15 min ultrasonication in enzyme solution is also recommended.\nAspirate the solution and replenish with 10% bleach. Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.\nRinse 3x with PBS.\nStore in 70% ethanol at 4 °C until use.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
