    "E. coli transformation (Day 1: ~2.5 h followed by over-night incubation)Note: We recommend a fresh transformation prior to each imaging experiment to ensure proper mRNA-SiRA expression. Add 50 ng of the plasmids (pET-GFP and pET-GFP-SiRA5) into each autoclaved microcentrifuge tube and put them on ice.Thaw chemically competent E. coli BL21 StarTM (DE3) cells for 15 min on ice.Add 40 μl of E. coli BL21 StarTM (DE3) cells to each tube and incubate for an additional 30 min on ice.Heat the tubes for 45 s at 42 °C followed by incubation on ice for 2 min.Add 250 μl of pre-warmed (37 °C) LB medium to each tube and shake them at 650 rpm for 60 min.For the selection of bacteria carrying the plasmid, streak 20 μl of the bacteria on LB agar plates containing 30 μg/ml of kanamycin.Incubate the LB agar plates overnight at 37 °C.Note: In the morning, place the agar plates at 4 °C and keep them there throughout the day.Induction of mRNA expression in bacteria (Day 2: 15 min followed by over-night incubation; Day 3: ~ 5 h)Add 5 ml of LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin into a 15 ml Falcon and start an overnight culture using a single colony picked from each LB agar plate using a sterile pipette tip.Incubate the Falcon at 37 °C with vigorous shaking at 170 rpm overnight.The next morning, measure the optical density (OD600) for a 1:10 dilution of each overnight culture.Generate a starter culture from the overnight culture. For this, add 10 ml of LB medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin in a 50 ml Falcon and add the overnight culture to give an OD600 of 0.05.Shake the culture at 37 °C and 170 rpm till the OD600 reaches 0.35.Note: This usually takes 1.5-2 h.",
    "Induce the expression of GFP mRNA by adding 10 μl of IPTG (1 mM final concentration) and shake the culture for an additional 3 h at 37 °C.Note: Currently the SiRA system has only been used for imaging highly overexpressed GFP mRNAs. In order to visualize lower copy numbers, a larger number of tandem repeats can be designed and further optimization of the protocol (e.g., dye concentration) might be necessary.Preparation of poly-D-lysine coated glass chamber slides (Day 3: ~3 h, in parallel to Steps B5-B6)Note: The poly-D-lysine solution for coating needs to be prepared freshly every time just before adding it to the well. The poly-D-lysine coated glass chamber slides, however, can be prepared up to 24 h in advance and stored in the refrigerator at 6 °C. Warming up to RT before use is recommended. Remove the 8-well ibidi glass slides from the packaging and incubate each well with 200 μl of a 10 M aqueous KOH solution for 5 min.Remove the KOH solution from the wells very carefully, wash them thoroughly multiple times with 400 μl sterile MilliQ water and air-dry them for 60 min.Mix 1,000 μl of water with 20 μl of the poly-D-lysine stock (~50 μg/μl final concentration) and add 250 μl of the solution quickly into each well (recipe for 4 wells).Incubate the wells for 45 min at room temperature.Wash each well twice with 300 μl sterile MilliQ water and air-dry for at least 30 min prior to the immobilization of the bacteria.Preparation of E. coli samples for imaging (Day 3: ~1 h)Note: For live-cell imaging experiments, we recommend to image up to 2 wells at a time, due to the short mRNA half-life and bacterial metabolism.",
    "Transfer a 200 μl aliquot of each culture (Step B6) to an autoclaved microcentrifuge tube and pellet the cells at 5,600 x g for 2 min at room temperature.Remove the LB medium and suspend the bacteria in 1 ml of M9 imaging solution (Recipe 1).Add 200 μl of the cell suspension into each well of the coated 8-well ibidi slide.Incubate the bacteria for 35 min at room temperature to allow for adhesion to the surface.Gently wash each well with 400 μl of M9 imaging solution.Add 300 μl of M9 imaging solution containing 500 nM of the silicon rhodamine fluorogenic dye and directly prepare for imaging.Note: Permeation of the dye into the bacterium is quite fast (5-10 min) at 37 °C; therefore, the time for microscope adjustment is sufficient for incubation. If permeation issues occur, prewarming of the dye/M9 imaging solution to 37 °C is recommended.Imaging GFP-SiRA5 mRNA using a confocal microscope (Day 3: ~1-2 h)Turn on the 488 nm (green channel) and 640 nm (red channel) lasers for fluorescence illumination of the point scanning confocal microscope and use the 525/50 nm and 700/75 nm emission filters for green and red channel, respectively.Attach the temperature incubation chamber to the microscope, prewarm to 37 °C and place the 8-well slide with adherent E. coli into the chamber.Use the bright-field illumination to focus on the immobilized E. coli with the Nikon N Apo 60x NA 1.4 λs OI (WD 0.14 mm, FOV 0.21 x 0.21 mm) objective, starting with the pET-GFP-SiRA5 transformed cells.Determine a suitable exposure time for the GFP and red channel as well as the correct z-axis. Choose the settings such that you do not saturate the pixels but still obtain the highest fluorescent signal.Acquire the brightfield and fluorescence images of all channels (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200425/20200425115643_7652.jpgFigure 4.",
    "Example of GFP mRNA imaging in live E. coli using a confocal microscope. A. Schematic of the plasmid used in the imaging experiment. Binding of the fluorophore to the SiRA aptamers generates a fluorescence signal in the red detection channel of the microscope. B. No-wash live-cell imaging of GFP mRNA in live E. coli cells. The cells were transformed with either the GFP plasmid or the GFP-SiRA5 plasmid, and the images taken with the bright field, green (protein expression) and red channel (mRNA detection). Scale bars = 5 µm. C. Zoom-in of the images depicted in Figure 4B. Scale bars = 5 µm.Repeat Steps E3-E5 with the E. coli cells carrying the control plasmid pET-GFP using the same microscope settings.For background correction, we use Fiji/Image J image analysis software. Manually pick a surface area without attached E. coli cells and subtract its mean fluorescence signal from the whole image.(Optional) Adjustment of the STED microscopeEnsure spatial and temporal overlap of the 640-nm excitation and 779-nm depletion beam foci by scanning a gold bead (GC80) with detection in both color channels.At first, separate the reflected/scattered excitation and depletion light beams into two beams by a 650-nm long-pass dichroic mirror. Then, filter the two beams by band-path filters 780/10 nm (center/width) and 640/10 nm until they are detected by the two avalanche photodiodes (APDs).Use the Imspector software to synchronize the scan signal and photon detection intervals, thus generating two-channel images without spectral crosstalk.Note: If necessary, the depletion beam needs to be slightly adjusted to ensure that the center of the STED image (with a doughnut-like profile) is precisely overlaid with the excitation image (with a Gaussian profile). Check the temporal overlap between the excitation and depletion pulses.",
    "Therefore, collect the reflected 640-nm and 779-nm light by the gold beads by using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) card and sort them with respect to the common trigger signal. The delay between the 640 nm excitation and 779 nm pulses can be monitored in the oscilloscope display-module of the TCSPC software.Note: For optimal depletion, the delay between the excitation and depletion pulses can be adjusted (in our example ~200 ps) by using a delay box, which routes the trigger output of the depletion laser to the trigger input of the excitation laser.Imaging dark-red beads (Day 3: ~1 h)Note: Images of dark-red beads are taken to determine the resolution of the STED microscope and should be carried out before or in parallel to the sample preparation. Dilute FluosphereTM 40-nm dark-red beads (660/680) from the stock solution into PBS at a volume ratio of 1:104.Add 200 μl of the solution to one of the poly-D-lysine coated imaging chambers and incubate for 5 min at room temperature to immobilize the beads on the surface.Wash the coverslip twice with 250 μl MilliQ water and finally add 250 μl MilliQ water for imaging.Place the coverslip onto the microscope slide holder.Adjust the excitation power to 5 μW at the sample and image with the depletion laser at different powers between 0 mW to 150 mW. Scan a rectangular area of 10 x 10 μm2 with 1,024 x 1,024 pixels, covering dozens of individual dark-red beads.Note: To minimize photo-bleaching upon multiple scans of the same region, it is recommended to use a fresh region for STED imaging at the different STED laser intensities. Generate a comparable image between confocal and STED modes (Figure 5A). Therefore, image the same area sequentially by confocal and STED microscopy.",
    "Note: By changing the depletion power, the effective resolution can be varied, as shown by images of a bead taken at different powers of the depletion beam (Figure 5B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200425/20200425115706_5091.jpgFigure 5. Dark-red bead images. A. Confocal (upper left) and STED (lower right) image of fluorescent beads on a glass coverslip, showing the enormous resolution enhancement due to STED imaging. Scale bar = 3 µm. B. Image of an individual bead taken at different powers of the depletion beam.Evaluation of the STED resolution using dark-red bead images (Day 3: ~1 h)For data evaluation, select ten beads for each STED intensity. For each bead, extract a line (with single-pixel width) crossing the bead through its center and fit with a Gaussian function.Note: The fit yields a raw full width at half maximum (FWHMr), which includes the size of the dark-red beads (d0 = 40 nm). The real STED resolution (FWHM) can then be estimated as (FWHMr2 - d02)1/2. Based on the statistics of ten beads, the symbols and error bars in Figure 6A show, respectively, the means and standard deviations of the FWHMs at each STED intensity. The theoretical curve, which is fitted with the model FWHM = FWHM0/(1 + γ·ISTED2)1/2, describes the image resolution as a function of STED power. Here, FWHM0 is the resolution of the confocal microscope (with depletion beam off), ISTED is the intensity of the depletion beam, and γ is a coefficient that depends on the slope of the STED doughnut and the saturation intensity of the depletion beam (Harke et al., 2008). Compare cross-sectional intensity distributions obtained by confocal (zero depletion power) and STED imaging (150 mW depletion power) of a 40 nm bead (Figure 6B).",
    "[Example Figure 6A: FWHMs of Gaussian fits (solid lines in Figure 6A) yield FWHMr = 339 ± 11 nm for confocal mode and 50 ± 3 nm for STED mode. Removing the size of the dark-red beads, we obtain an estimated resolution of our STED microscope as 32 ± 5 nm.]imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200425/20200425115730_0550.jpgFigure 6. Determination of the STED resolution. A. Solid squares: Quantification of the widths of cross-sections through individual beads as a function of the power of the depletion laser (see Figure 5B). Data were corrected for the intrinsic size of the beads and are shown as means ± standard deviations from ten bead images. Red line: fit with a square-root function according to STED theory. B. Cross sections through a single bead imaged at 0 and 150 mW depletion laser power (see Figure 5) showing the enormous resolution enhancement offered by STED microscopy. Gaussian fits are shown as solid lines.Imaging GFP-SiRA5 mRNA in live E. coli with STED microscopy (Day 3: ~1-2 h)Attach the temperature-controlled sample chamber to the microscope, prewarm to 37 °C and add the 8-well imaging slide used in Step E2.Set the power of the excitation and depletion beams (Example Figure 7: Excitation 5 μW, depletion 150 mW). Scan repeatedly a square region of 10 x 10 μm2, covering a group of E. coli cells, for five frames of 1,024 x 1,024 pixels (Pixel dwell time in Figure 7A: 30 μs, the main image of Figure 7A corresponds to the inset with t = 126 s).After taking the STED images, switch off the depletion laser and take a confocal image (Figure 7B).Note: No deconvolution was carried out on either the STED or the confocal images. Different color maps can be used for the STED and confocal images to optimally display cell structures.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20200425/20200425115755_4271.jpgFigure 7.",
