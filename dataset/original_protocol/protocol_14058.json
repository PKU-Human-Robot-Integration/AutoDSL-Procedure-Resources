    "1. Preparation of connectors and infusion lines\nSterilely retrieve the connectors.\nOn the 3-way extension stopcock, screw 1 connector into each socket of the stopcock and 1 connector into the end of the extension line. Take 0.9% NaCl with a 50 mL syringe to purge the extension and the lines. Purge each 3-way extension with 0.9% NaCl through the 2 connectors of the stopcock.\nTake the infusion manifold. Unscrew each single-use cap. Screw 1 connector into each socket of the manifold to replace the caps. Purge the infusion line through each connector by turning each stopcock sequentially.\n\tNOTE: At the end of this step, there are 3 extensions with 3-way stopcock with purged connectors and an infusion manifold with purged connectors.\n2. Placement of the catheter\nPlace the central venous catheter sterilely according to usual practice in the unit or a previously described protocol9.\nCheck the permeability of each line by aspiration of blood and then reinjection of 0.9% NaCl serum. Clamp the lines.\n3. Installation of the connectors\nScrew the extension’s connector of each 3-way extension stopcock into each catheter line. These connectors, directly connected to the lines of the catheter, are the \"proximal connectors\". Unclamp the lines.\nConnect the infusion manifold line to one of the connectors of the 3-way stopcock of the distal line.\n\tNOTE: There is no need to place a vein guard on the manifold or extensions.\n4. Use of connectors and infusion lines\nBefore each infusion, disinfect the end of the connector for 3 s with a sterile compress soaked in 70% isopropyl alcohol. Connect the syringe or tubing directly to the connector by screwing and injecting. After injection or infusion, unscrew the device. Do not remove the connector.",
    "If needed, rinse an unused line with 3 mL of saline. There is no need to clamp or infuse an unused line with a vein guard. Leave the proximal valve in place even if the line is not perfused.\n5. Replacement and maintenance of connectors and infusion lines\nAlways change the connectors every 7 days except for the proximal connectors. Thus, every week, the nurse prepares the extensions with 3-way stopcock and the infusion manifold in sterile conditions (see step 1).\nUnscrew the used extensions at the proximal valve and screw the new sterile and purged extensions to the catheter on the proximal connector (see step 3).\nOnly change a proximal connector if it is soiled (to maintain the catheter in a \"closed\" system).\nIn case of macroscopic contamination, rinse the connector with 10 mL of 0.9% NaCl. If there is still contamination, replace the connector. In the event of transfusion, infusion of lipid solution (e.g. propofol) or parenteral nutrition, change the tubing and connectors of the line concerned every 24 hours.\nChange other infusion lines and tubing according to the practices and protocols of each unit.\nSubscription Required.
