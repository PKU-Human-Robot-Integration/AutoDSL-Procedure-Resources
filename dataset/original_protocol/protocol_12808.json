  "procedures": [
    "All procedures were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th ed., National Academies Press, Revised 2011), and have been approved by the NINDS Animal Care Committee.\n1. AAV9-miRNA design strategy and miRNA selection\nUse miRWalk predictive database to select candidate miRNAs that interact with the mRNA 3'UTR region of the target gene.15\n\tNOTE: Restrict minimum seed length of miRNA sequence to at least 7 nucleotides. Select other established miRNA prediction programs (miRanda, miRDB, Targetscan) for comparative analysis. Based on these selection criteria, here, miR-185, miR-298, miR-873, and miR-877 were selected for further evaluation.\nRetrieve the sequence of the selected miRNA from miRBase (http://www.mirbase.org/).\nClone the pri-mir (60- 70 nts) and its 250-300 nts flanking genomic sequence on both sides, or a mock sequence, into the appropriate AAV cis vector.\n\tNOTE: The flanking sequence is required for correct pri-mir expression and mature microRNA processing. Select a dual-promoter rAAV cis vector with an expression cassette consisting for example of a human elongation factor-1 alpha (EIF1α) promoter followed by the selected miRNA or mock sequence, and the human cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter followed by cDNA encoding the GFP fluorescent tag. The EIFα promoter was chosen because it guarantees stable and homogeneous expression, with minimal risks of silencing. Tissue specific or conditional promoters can be used, depending on specific applications.\nPrepare, purify, and titrate the AAV, following published protocols.16\n\tNOTE: Here, cloning of the pri-mir into the AAV vector and viral production were performed by an external manufacturer.\n2. Tail Vein Injection of AAV-miRNA Plasmid",
    "NOTE: This step needs adjustment according to the target gene and the age and weight of the mice. Use the Institutional and Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines to determine the dose range, volume and best route of administration based on the age and weight of the mice. GFP fluorescence signal and miRNA expression levels in target tissues are expected to peak starting 2 weeks after the injection. The following protocol refers to male mice in early adulthood. AAV should be handled as a biohazard under Biosafety Level 1 guidelines.\nDivide AAV-miRNA plasmid stock in 100-200 µL aliquots containing a viral load of 1010-1011 viral genomes per mL (vg/mL) using sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Laboratory biohazard personal protective equipment should be used to handle the AAV solution.\n\tNOTE: Once an aliquot is thawed it can be stored at 4 °C for up to two weeks. Viral stock can be stored in -80 °C freezer.\nRestrain the mouse in commercially available restrainers such as plastic or tapered plastic film tube of proper size.\nClean the surface of the tail with 70% alcohol wipes.\nHold a warm pad (28-30 °C) under the tail to increase vasodilation for 30 s. Alternatively, warm the animals using a red heat lamp (at a distance of 2-3 feet) or by dipping the tail into warm water.\nStarting from the distal portion of the tail, insert the needle (27-30 G) loaded with the viral aliquot, bevel up, 15° from the tail, into the vein. Before injection, ensure the needle is inserted correctly.\nIf resistance is felt during injection, or swelling appears under skin, stop the procedure. Remove the needle and re-insert the needle above the previous injection site.",
    "NOTE: Alternatively, this can be achieved by gently aspirating the needle and observing blood. Hard aspiration can collapse the tail vein. If the vein blanches during injection, the needle is inserted correctly.\nAfter the injection has been completed, wait a few seconds before raising the needle.\nObserve the injection site for bleeding. Apply moderate pressure using two fingers to the site until bleeding stops.\nReturn the animal to its cage.\n3. Behavioral Assays\nNOTE: All experiments were conducted blindly by a third party with concealment of treatments by uniquely coded vials. Order of treatments was randomized. When performing the tests described below, experimental conditions (type of room and time of the day) should be controlled to reduce variation. This test should be performed on mice older than four weeks to attain reliable results. Mouse underwent behavioral assessment once before viral injection at 5 weeks of age to obtain baseline of normal performance. After viral injection, mice were assessed once a week starting 48 h after injection, up to 40 weeks of age.\nBring the mouse injected with AAV to a quiet, dark room that is free of noise or other disturbances at least 30 min before starting the tests. Do not disturb the animals during this period of acclimatization.\nAcclimatize the mouse to the new room for 30 min and then start the following behavioral assays (steps 3.3 and 3.4). Keep a gap of 10 min in between each behavioral assay.\nHanging wire test\n\tNOTE: This test monitors muscle strength and motor dysfunction.",
    "Use a padding sheet to act as a cushion. Pick up the mouse by its tail and place it on the center of the wire grid rack. Raise the rack 15-20 inches above the surface and slowly invert the screen to allow the animal to adjust its grip on the screen.\nOnce the rack is completely inverted, start the timer, and record the time to fall.\n\t\tNOTE: Mice will hang with four limbs on a grid. If the wire is set too low the mice may not hang on. If mice fall off the grid before 60 s, place them back on the grid, reset the timer, and repeat this procedure up to two more tries. Register the best performance.\nWhen the time limit of 60 s is reached, return the animal back to the cage.\nFoot print assay\n\tNOTE: The absorbent sheet should be a narrow runway about 70 cm long and 5 cm wide with 5 cm high walls.\n\t\nHold the mouse gently by one hand and apply red ink to the front paws and blue ink to the hind paws with a brush.\nPlace the absorbent sheet on the floor of a narrow runway.\nAllow the mouse to walk or run over an absorbent sheet in a straight line in the runway from one end to other.\nRepeat the process two more times with the mouse using a fresh absorbent sheet.\nMeasure the distance between two consecutive steps in the forward movement. Do not include first and last few footprints where the animal is just initiating and finishing its run.\n4. Euthanasia and Tissue Harvest\nUse a euthanasia chamber or a bell jar. If using a bell jar, perform the procedure under a fume hood.",
    "Soak cotton with isoflurane and place it in the bell jar. Use a physical separator to keep the animal from physical contact with the anesthesia material. Place the animal in the jar immediately after this step.\n\tNOTE: The bell jar should not be pre-charged with isoflurane to avoid the possibility of hypoxemia in the animals.\nContinue isoflurane exposure until 30 s after breathing stops.\nImmediately after removing the mouse from the jar, euthanize by cervical dislocation.\n\tNOTE: This step should take place as rapidly as possible to avoid tissue degradation.\nHarvest the spinal cord first and then the quadriceps skeletal muscle.\nTo harvest the spinal cord, expose the backside of the mouse and fix the four limbs on the side to a dissection board.\nWash the site of dissection with 70% ethanol.\nPerform cervical dislocation using a sharp scissor.\nMake an incision in the skin in the median line. Remove the pelt by either cutting or careful tearing of the skin in the transverse plane, followed by pulling the pelt up and over the head. Remove the head by cutting with scissors beneath the shoulder blades and at the C1-2 region of the column (found adjacent to the base of the skull).\n\t\t\nCut the abdominal wall musculature on the ventral side and continue laterally, one direction at a time, until the spinal column is reached.\nUsing a sharp scissor remove vertebrae starting from the cervical spinal cord. Remove the lateral parts of the vertebrae by cutting across the vertebral arches at both sides.\nAfter removing the entire vertebrae release the spinal cord.\nSnap freeze the harvested tissues in pre-chilled 2-methylbutane using the following method:\nHalf fill a stainless steel bowl with 2-methylbutane and submerge the bottom quarter of the bowl in a container filled with liquid nitrogen.",
    "Pre-chill the 2-methylbutane in liquid nitrogen for 1-2 min.\nPlace the skeletal muscle with forceps in the 2-methylbutane until it turns white. Immediately transfer the tissue to dry ice and then store it at -80 °C.\nFor spinal cord immunostaining, embed the tissue in paraffin blocks at room temperature before snap freezing as described.17\nFor biochemical analysis and miRNA quantification,1 place the harvested tissue in a cryovial and freeze in liquid nitrogen. Store the samples at -80 °C."
