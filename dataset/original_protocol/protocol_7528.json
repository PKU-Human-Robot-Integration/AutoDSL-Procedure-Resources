    "Human kidney progenitor cells (KPC): isolation, maintenance, and cryopreservation In this section, we describe how to isolate primary kidney progenitor cells from human tissue. The method we describe exploits the ~50-fold higher proliferative capacity of KPC cells in comparison to other renal cell types in a specific growth medium (Peired et al., 2020). Based on our experience, this method allows to obtain a pure population of viable kidney progenitors more easily than the multi-step process based on separation using magnetic beads.Isolation of KPC from human kidney tissueCollect a fragment of kidney cortex (from 1 to 3 cm3) from the pole opposite to the tumor. Store the tissue in sterile physiological saline solution during transport to the laboratory. We recommend performing the kidney cell isolation within 1 h after surgical tissue collection.Remove the kidney capsule and transfer the sample to a 100 mm sterile dish. Mince the cortex in pieces as small as possible using a scalpel. Add to the dish 5 mL of 750 U/mL collagenase type IV prepared in EBM medium. Incubate for 45 min at 37 °C in the incubator. Neutralize the enzymatic reaction by adding 10 mL of EBM containing 10 % FBS. CAUTION:  During mincing, maintain the tissue fragments humidified by adding a drop of sterile physiological saline solution.Transfer the suspension to graded mesh screens (60 and 80 mesh). Mechanically break down the tissue suspension using a glass pestle and pass it through the 60 and 80 mesh screens. Wash thoroughly with 20 mL of kidney progenitor cell washing medium and recover the flowthrough in a polypropylene urine container. Transfer this suspension to a 50 mL polypropylene tube and centrifuge at 400× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Aspirate the supernatant and wash the pellet with 5 mL of PBS.",
    "Centrifuge at 400× g for 5 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of red blood cell lysis buffer.Incubate for 4 min at 37 °C and then stop the reaction by adding 10 mL of kidney progenitor cell washing medium.Centrifuge at 400× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 10 mL of kidney progenitor cell growth medium.Count cell suspension using a Bürker counting chamber.Transfer the cells in 75 cm2 flask (500,000 cells/flask) in 8 mL/flask kidney progenitor cell growth medium. Label as passage 0.Place the cells in a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator.After three days, replace the medium with fresh kidney progenitor cell growth medium to remove unattached cells and continue with twice-a-week changes until cells reach 80% confluency. It usually takes 7–10 days.Expansion and sub-culturing of KPCSub-culture when the cells are approximately 80% confluent.Aspirate the medium and wash with 6 mL of PBS.Aspirate PBS and add 2 mL of a 0.25 mg/mL trypsin/EDTA solution. Incubate in a 37 °C incubator for approximately 5 min. Check under the microscope if cells are detached.Neutralize the enzymatic reaction by adding 4 mL of kidney progenitor cell washing medium and collect the cells in a 15 mL polystyrene tube. Centrifuge the cells at 400× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Aspire supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet and resuspend the cells in 5 mL of kidney progenitor cell growth medium.Count the number of cells using a Bürker counting chamber.Replate the cells in 75 cm2 flasks with a ratio of 1:3 in kidney progenitor cell growth medium.Change medium twice a week during maintenance of cultures in a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator.",
    "Cryopreservation of KPCKidney progenitors are cryo-stored in 1 mL of freezing medium at a density from 5 × 105 up to 1 × 106 cells/cryogenic vial.Aspirate the medium from the 75 cm2 flask and wash with 6 mL of PBS.Aspirate the PBS and add 2 mL of a 0.25 mg/mL trypsin/EDTA solution. Incubate in a 37 °C incubator for approximately 5 min. Check under the microscope if cells are detached.Neutralize the enzymatic reaction by adding 4 mL of kidney progenitor cell washing medium and collect the cells in a 15 mL polystyrene tube. Centrifuge the cells at 400× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Aspire supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet and resuspend the cells in 5 mL of kidney progenitor cell growth medium.Count the number of cells using a Bürker counting chamber.Centrifuge the cells at 400× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Resuspend the cell pellet in freezing medium at a density of 1 × 106 cells/mL. Mix well.Aliquot in 1 mL per cryovial.Transfer the cryovials to a freezing container and put the freezing container into a -80 °C freezer.The next day, transfer the cryovials to a liquid nitrogen tank for long-time storage. CAUTION:  Minimize as much as possible the time cells remain in freezing medium at room temperature. Transfer immediately in the freezing container to -80 °C.Thawing of kidney progenitor cellsThaw a vial of cells. To achieve rapid warming, place the frozen vial into a 37 °C water bath.Transfer immediately the content of each vial to a 15 mL tube containing 4 mL of kidney progenitor cell washing medium.Centrifuge at 400× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells into 2 mL of kidney progenitor cell growth medium.",
    "Transfer the cell suspension to 75 cm2 flasks at a density of approximately 500,000 cells/flask in 8 mL/flask of kidney progenitor cell growth medium. Place the cells in a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator.Differentiation of KPC into podocytes Detach the cells at 60%–80% confluency with trypsin as described above.Count cells and plate in a 6-well plate at a density of 80,000 cell/well in 1.5 mL/well of kidney progenitor cell growth medium.Place the cells in a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator.After 5–6 h (or when cells are attached to the plate), gently remove the medium and replace with 1.5 mL/well of EBM without any supplement and without serum. Place the cells in a 5% CO2, 37 °C incubator.After 16 h, remove the EBM medium and stimulate the cells for 48 h with 1.5 mL/well of differentiation medium containing 0.2 μM panobinostat in DMEM-F12 + 10% HyClone Defined FBS.At the end of differentiation, characterize the cells using qRT-PCR and immunofluorescence. CAUTION:  To obtain better differentiation results, use cells at early passages (P1–P2)."
