    "The Institutional Review Board of the Clement J. Zablocki Veterans Affairs Medical Center approved the protocols. Written informed consent was waived because invasive cardiac monitoring and TEE are routinely used in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery in our institution. Patients with relative or absolute contraindications for TEE, those undergoing repeat median sternotomy or emergency surgery, and those with atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmias were excluded from participation.\n1. Anesthesia\nProvide each patient with intravenous midazolam (1 to 3 mg) and fentanyl (50 to 150 µg) for conscious sedation before surgery.\nUse local anesthesia (subcutaneous 1% lidocaine) for insertion of intravenous and radial artery catheters. Test the quality of the local anesthesia with a pinprick.\nEnsure that the patient receives supplemental oxygen using a nasal cannula (2 to 4 L/min).\nPlace a central venous or pulmonary artery catheter using local anesthesia (subcutaneous 1% lidocaine) under sterile conditions through the right or left internal jugular vein with ultrasound guidance based on appropriate clinical indications.\nInduce anesthesia using intravenous fentanyl (5 mcg/kg), propofol (1 to 2 mg/kg), and rocuronium (0.1 mg/kg). Maintain anesthesia using inhaled isoflurane (end-tidal concentration of 1%) in an air-oxygen mixture, fentanyl (1 to 2 µg/kg/h), and rocuronium (0.05 mg/kg) titrated to effect using neuromuscular monitoring.\nSuction the stomach using an oral-gastric tube.\nPlace ultrasound jelly in the patient’s hypopharynx. Lift the jaw anteriorly and advance a TEE probe into the esophagus with gentle pressure to overcome resistance of the hypopharygeus muscle.\n2. Transesophageal Echocardiography\nPerform a comprehensive TEE examination following American Society of Echocardiography/Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists guidelines42 in each patient.\nPlace a pulse-wave Doppler sample volume between the tips of the mitral leaflets to record trans-mitral blood flow velocity in the mid-esophageal four-chamber TEE imaging plane (Figure 1).",
    "Identify the early LV filling and atrial systole blood flow waveforms of trans-mitral blood flow velocity, and measure their corresponding peak velocities and velocity-time integrals (VTIE and VTIA, respectively) using the echocardiography equipment’s integrated software package (Figure 1).\nCalculate the atrial filling fraction (β) as the ratio of atrial to total LV filling:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58374/58374eq1.jpg\nMeasure the maximum diameter of the LV outflow tract immediately below the aortic valve in the mid-esophageal aortic valve long axis TEE view during mid-systole (Figure 2A).\nCalculate the area of the LV outflow tract assuming circular geometry as the product of π/4 and the square of the diameter (see step 2.5 above).\nObtain a deep transgastric long axis TEE view, and place a pulse-wave Doppler sample volume in the distal LV outflow tract to record a blood flow velocity envelope (Figure 2B) at the same level where the diameter was measured (see step 2.5 above); integrate the area of this waveform using the echocardiography equipment’s software package to obtain VTI.\nMultiply the resulting velocity-time integral (VTI) of the LV outflow track blood flow velocity waveform (Figure 2B) by the area of the outflow track (see step 2.6) to obtain stroke volume (SV).\nRecord video clips of the mid-esophageal bicommissural and LV long axis TEE imaging planes, respectively42. Be sure to include several cardiac cycles in each recording.\nVisually inspect slow-motion images of the video clips (see step 2.9 above) after the ECG T-wave to choose the maximum opening of the mitral valve leaflets.\nMeasure the distance between the mitral leaflets (Figures 3A and 3B) using the echocardiography equipment’s “caliper” function.\nCalculate the mitral valve diameter (D) as the average of the major (transcommissural anterior-lateral-posterior-medial) and minor (anterior-posterior) lengths.\nCalculate VFT using the formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/58374/58374eq2.jpg\nPerform all quantitative echocardiographic measurements in triplicate at end-expiration.",
    "3. Experimental Design\nDetermine VFT, indices of LV diastolic function, and hemodynamics during steady-state conditions 30 minutes before and 15, 30, and 60 minutes after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in 10 patients with normal preoperative LV ejection fraction under coronary artery surgery to test the hypothesis that CPB transiently decreases VFT39.\nTest the hypothesis that LV pressure-overload hypertrophy produced by aortic valve stenosis reduces VFT by examining (in one group of 8 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement) for severe aortic stenosis and comparing observations to another group of 8 patients with normal LV wall thickness undergoing coronary artery surgery40. Measure VFT, LV diastolic function, hemodynamics, and end-diastolic posterior wall thickness during steady-state conditions 30 minutes before CPB.\nTest the hypothesis that abnormal diastolic blood flow entering the LV affects trans-mitral LV filling efficiency in 8 patients with aortic valve stenosis and moderate aortic insufficiency versus 8 patients with aortic stenosis who do not have regurgitant valves38. Measure VFT and other parameters as described above (step 3.2).\nTest the hypothesis that advanced age is associated with a reduction in LV filling efficiency quantified using VFT in 7 octogenarians (82 ± 2 years) compared to 7 younger patients (55 ± 6 years)41 undergoing coronary artery surgery. Ensure that both groups have normal preoperative LV ejection fraction. Measure VFT and other parameters as described above (step 3.2).\n4. Statistics\nPresent the data as mean ± standard deviation.\nEvaluate data using analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni’s modification of Student’s t-test.\nUse linear regression analysis to determine the relationships between VFT and end-diastolic posterior wall thickness and between VFT and age.\nReject the null hypothesis when p < 0.05.\nSubscription Required.
