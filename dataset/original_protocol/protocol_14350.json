    "Participants in the study from which the representative-subject data presented below were extracted20 (n = 11) were required to give their written informed consent prior to initiation of testing after the experimental procedures, associated risks and potential benefits of participation had been explained. The first visit comprised a familiarization session during which the swimmers were introduced to the concept of tethered swimming and the measurement techniques that would be in effect during the actual testing. An all-out tethered-swimming test was performed during the second visit and the rapidly incremented tethered-swimming protocol was performed on the third visit. Both tests were done in a semi-Olympic pool (25 m) with water temperature at 28 °C.\n1. Preparation of swimmer\nInstruct the swimmer to avoid strenuous exercise for 24 h preceding each testing session.\nInstruct the swimmer to arrive at the pool in a rested and fully hydrated state ≥3 h postprandial.\nInstruct the swimmer to refrain from ingesting stimulant beverages and alcohol for 24 h prior to each test.\n2. All-out tethered-swimming test\nPrepare the 500 kg load cell that will be used to measure the highest force that the swimmer can exert during two trials comprising 30 s of all-out swimming21.\n\t\nOpen the N2000PRO Software (Power Din Pro - CEFISE) program on the computer.\nOpen the Help Menu to verify the communication link between the computer and the load-cell analyzer.\n\t\t\nObserve a green signal that indicates that the connection to the RS232 interface is well established.\nSet the countdown to start the test depending on circumstances.\nSet the sampling duration. Set the rest interval. Set the frames per second at 100 Hz.\nSet the unit of force measurement at N or kg depending on personal preference. Set the acquisition time in milliseconds.",
    "Calibrate the load cell22 with 0 and 10 kg loads with the swimmer outside pool.\nAttach a load cell to the start block via the L-shaped flattened iron bar that is designed by CEFISE specifically for tethered-swimming measurements.\nAttach one end of the inelastic rope to the load cell and the other end to the swimmer by means of the custom-designed belt (CEFISE), which has ropes attached to both hips such that leg kicking will not interfere with the force measurement.\nPrepare the swimmer for performance of the two-trial test.\n\t\nProvide instructions to the swimmer regarding correct performance of all-out front-crawl swimming (e.g., prevent the head and trunk from rising while swimming as rapidly as possible, concentrate on kicking at a maximal rate in addition to maximal stroking, etc.).\nInstruct the swimmer to perform stretching and arm/leg swings at poolside in preparation.\nInstruct the swimmer to enter the pool and perform a standard warm-up protocol comprised of front-crawl swimming for 800 m at a light intensity with care taken to avoid engendering any lingering effects that could influence the results of the test.\nAllow the swimmer to exit the pool and rest at poolside for 10 min.\nSecure the belt around swimmer's waist. Attach the free end of the inelastic rope to the belt.\nDetermine the load required to maintain the swimmer's body horizontally with a minimum amount of tension on the measurement system (loadbase).\nSignal the swimmer to begin Trial #1 of the test.\nMonitor the swimmer during performance of the test.\n\t\nProvide verbal encouragement to swimmer throughout 30 s test.\nSignal the swimmer to end the test. Detach the swimmer from the inelastic rope.\nInstruct the swimmer to perform a standard cool-down protocol comprised of front-crawl swimming at a light intensity.",
    "Allow the swimmer to rest for 30 min at poolside.\nReattach the swimmer to the inelastic rope.\nSignal the swimmer to start Trial #2 of the test which is identical to Trial #1 (30 s of all-out swimming).\nSignal the swimmer to end the test.\nInstruct the swimmer to perform a standard cool-down protocol comprised of front-crawl swimming at a light intensity.\nAllow the swimmer to exit pool.\nAnalyze the data collected during the two-trial test.\n\t\nApply the smoothing process to the data using the N2000PRO software package23.\nCalculate the peaks of the wave-frequency signal from the force-time sinusoidal curve (range, sine 80°-100°) above loadbase for Trials #1 and 2.\nDefine the averaged peaks of the force-time wave-frequency signal in the first 5 s and entire 30 s, respectively, as the peak force (Fpeak) and average force (Favg) for each trial.\nUse the higher values for Fpeak and Favg for further calculations.\n3. Incremental tethered-swimming test\nCalculate the loads that will be used to resist the swimmer's forward displacement during the incremental test.\n\t\nCalculate the starting load as 30% of the Favg above loadbase.\nCalculate the increments to be applied per 60-s stage as 5% of Favg above loadbase.\nPrepare the automated portable metabolic unit for data collection.\n\t\nOpen the unit's software.\nVerify the communication link between the computer and the automated portable metabolic unit.\nPower on unit and allow to warm up for 45 min. Ensure that batteries are fully charged.\nPerform calibration of unit for environmental air24.\nPerform calibration of unit for reference O2 (16%), CO2 (5%) and N (balance) concentrations24.\nPerform mask time-delay calibration24.\nPerform calibration of turbine with 3 L syringe24.\nEnter the subject data, ambient temperature and humidity.\nPrepare the swimmer for performance of the incremental test.",
    "Install a facemask and a snorkel on the swimmer.\nInstruct the swimmer to rest at poolside for 10 min to collect \"baseline\" gas exchange and ventilatory data.\nInstruct the swimmer to enter the pool and perform a standard warm-up protocol comprised of front-crawl swimming at a light intensity.\nSecure a belt around the swimmer's waist. Attach an inelastic rope to the belt with the other end of rope attached to the loading system.\nInstruct the swimmer that once the test begins to use the two markers on the bottom of the pool for reference points, which allow them to maintain a relatively-fixed position (e.g., ± 1 m from the desired position).\nSignal the swimmer to begin the test.\nMonitor the swimmer during performance of the incremental test.\n\tNOTE: A research assistant who is experienced in monitoring this type of testing should hold the gas-analysis unit at poolside being cognizant to do so without impeding swimmer displacement and/or elevating the swimmer's head.\n\t\nIncrease load while timing the 60 s stages.\nTerminate the test and record the time to limit of exercise tolerance when the swimmer is no longer able to maintain the requisite position despite strong verbal encouragement from the testers.\nUse the time to limit of exercise tolerance to calculate stages completed.\nRecord loads for each stage and peak load.\nDetach the swimmer from the inelastic rope.\nInstruct the swimmer to perform a standard cool-down protocol comprised of front-crawl swimming at a low-to-moderate intensity.\nAllow the swimmer to exit the pool.\nAnalyze the data collected during the incremental test.\n\t\nSmooth breath-by-breath gas-exchange data that were collected before and during test using the unit's software program.\nExport gas-exchange data in consecutive 9 s bin averages.\nPerform three-point rolling average on consecutive 9 s bin averages for V̇O2.",
