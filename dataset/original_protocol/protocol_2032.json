    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDay 1 – Seed cells\nTiming: 30 min\nWe use DLD-1 BRCA2−/− and BRCA2 WT complemented cells, a derivative of the colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, DLD-1, a BRCA2 heterozygous cell line. BRCA2 was knocked out in DLD1, using a construct targeting exon 11 with flanking LoxP sites (Hucl et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). The BRCA2 WT complemented cell line was described previously (Chatterjee et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]).\nSeed cells in 6 cm2 plates, exact cell numbers will depend on the cell line used. Aim for cells that are sparse and actively growing at time of treatment (the following day). The cells should be in exponential growth and must not be over-confluent at the time of treatment. The number of plates seeded is determined by the number of experimental conditions being tested. Optimize cell seeding number to have cells at ∼30% confluency at time of treatment (note: correct cell density is crucial). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nDay 2 – Treatment with thymidine analogs (CldU and IdU) and fork stalling agent\nTiming: 8 h",
    "Nascent DNA in replicating cells is sequentially labeled with two different halogenated thymidine analogs, 5-chloro-2′deoxyuridine (CldU) followed by 5-iodo-2′deoxyuridine (IdU), for 30 min each. Cells are treated with 100 μM CldU in cell culture media containing FBS, for 30 min, washed three times with PBS, then treated with 100 μM ldU for 30 min, followed by three washes with PBS. The nascent DNA synthesized during the sequential treatments will incorporate CldU and IdU facilitating the visualization of DNA fibers at later steps. Immediately following CldU and IdU treatment, cells are washed to remove all traces of CldU/IdU and treated with 4 mM HU in the media for 5 h resulting in replication forks to stall (Schlacher et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]). Silanized coverslips are prepared which provide a positively charged, clean glass surface to which the DNA fibers will adhere. This method uses a combination of the liquid-phase silanization and UV-ozone cleaning (Labit et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Marheineke et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]). Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nTreat with thymidine analogs (time sensitive).\nPrepare CldU in cell culture media at a 100 μM concentration, prepare fresh. Stock is 10 mM in NaOH. Very light sensitive, prepare and use in the dark.\nRemove cell culture media from cells, add media containing CldU to cells, incubate cells for 30 min exactly, at 37°C and 5% CO2 (or standard tissue culture incubator conditions).\nPrepare IdU in cell culture media at a 100 μM concentration, prepare fresh. Stock is 10 mM in NaOH. Very light sensitive, prepare and use in the dark.\nAfter 30 min, remove CldU media and wash cells quickly 3× with PBS.\nRemove last PBS wash from cells and add media with IdU, place cells back in incubator for 30 min exactly.\nAfter 30 min, remove IdU media. Wash cells quickly 3× with PBS.",
    "Critical: Thymidine analogs are light sensitive; all analog treatments should be performed in the dark. Protect cells from light throughout treatments. The timing of analog incubations needs to be exact as just small variations will influence the results. Add and remove analogs/washes quickly as replication is ongoing during these intermissions.\nInduce fork stalling using hydroxyurea.\nMake a 1 M stock of hydroxyurea (HU) using water.\nDilute stock to 4 mM using cell culture media.\nRemove last PBS wash from cells and add HU media for 5 h.\nCritical: Hydroxyurea 1 M stock needs to be made fresh each time from powder (Schwob et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]).\nCoverslip preparation – perform in the fume hood (Labit et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Gallo et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Silanized coverslips perform best when prepared and used fresh. Preparation should be done in parallel with the DNA fiber combing experiment, the coverslips will be fully prepared the evening before combing. The preparation is a two-step process: cleaning followed by the formation of the organosilane monolayer.\nPlace 10 coverslips in a Wash-N-Dry rack (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A) using a fine point tweezers to handle the coverslips.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1626-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Example equipment used for this protocol\n(A–F) (A) Wash-N-Dry coverslip rack, (B) submerged coverslips, (C), Jelight UV Ozone cleaner, (D) glass desiccator jar, (E) water bath sonicator, (F) Fiber Comb machine.\nSubmerge the Wash-N-Dry rack in 200 proof Ethanol for 5–10 min, Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nAllow coverslips to dry uncovered, in the fumehood for 30 min.\nTreat each side of the coverslips using a UV Ozone cleaner, 30 min, seen in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C.\nLine the UV Ozone cleaner with aluminum foil.\nPlace coverslips on foil and treat for 30 min.\nFlip coverslips and treat the other side for 30 min.\nDehydrate the coverslips in the rack, for 1 h, in a 70°C incubator.",
    "Submerge coverslips in 70 mL N-Heptane + 1 mL Silane in a glass desiccator jar with drierite in the fumehood for 16–18 h, as seen in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D.\nCritical: Extreme caution must be taken in use of N-Heptane and silane, and they must be used in the fumehood. Do not cover the beaker containing silanization solution with parafilm or aluminum foil as the vapors will dissolve these coverings, the glass desiccator jar will provide an appropriate environment for the vapors. Other cleaning methods can be used if a UV Ozone cleaner is not available such as piranha solution or ion plasma cleaning (Marheineke et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nDay 2 – Preparation of agarose plugs and proteinase K treatment\nTiming: 2 h\nThe labeled cells are harvested and embedded in an agarose plug. This plug provides a scaffold which protects the cells from mechanical stress. Proteinase K treatment of the plug digests the cell membrane and proteins present in the labeled cells. The high concentration of EDTA present throughout the proteinase K treatment inhibits DNase activity protecting the genomic DNA.\nAgarose plug preparation.\nSet one water bath at 68°C and a second water bath at 50°C.\nPlace 1.2% low melting agarose aliquot at 68°C for 10 min, once melted, move agarose to 50°C water bath. 45 μL of agarose is needed per sample.\nTrypsinize and count cells. For DLD-1 cells, approximately 1.5 × 105 cell number is ideal for future steps. The cell number required is dependent on the replication aspect being investigated. Between 1 × 105 to 3 × 105 cells per plug is recommended as starting material for global replication analysis. 1–2 million cells per plug are needed for replication analysis of specific loci or telomeres.",
    "Pellet appropriate cell suspension volume for required cell number by centrifuging at 200 g for 5 min.\nWash cell pellet with 1 mL PBS by gently pipetting up and down.\nPellet cells by centrifuging at 200 g for 5 min.\nResuspend cells in 45 μL of trypsin by pipetting up and down.\nWarm cell suspension in 50°C water bath for 10 s. Add 45 μL of agarose and mix by pipetting up and down with a P200 pipette, while holding tube in the water bath.\nAdd trypsin-agarose solution to a well in a sealed plug mold (sealed using tape, Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A and 3B), avoid bubbles.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1626-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Gel plug mold setup\n(A and B) (A) Bio-Rad plug mold with plunger, (B) plug mold sealed with tape.\nPlace mold upright in a box, cover, and incubate at 4°C for 1 h to solidify.\nProteinase K treatment – prepare fresh.\nPrepare ESP buffer – 275 μL per plug.\n200 μL 0.5 M EDTA pH=8.\n25 μL 10% (w/v) Sarkosyl/0.5 M EDTA pH=8.\n50 μL Proteinase K (20 mg/mL).\nPlace 275 μL of ESP buffer in a 15 mL tube for each sample.\nPush each plug out using a plastic plunger into the ESP solution ensuring plug is immersed in ESP buffer.\nIncubate tubes at 50°C for 16–18 h.",
    "Note: Multiple plugs can be prepared for each sample. If more fibers are needed, multiple plugs per sample should be prepared to ensure an individual plug is not overloaded with DNA. See step 5 (c) in relation to appropriate cell number per plug. The optimal cell number per plug will be determined by the purpose of the study, and the cell type used, this number should be determined by each user based on the unique details of their study. Multiple plugs for the same sample can be washed (step 7) together.\nCritical: If plug isn’t fully solidified (step 6 (c)), do not move forward. Incubate at 4°C for another hour.\nCritical: Plugs are translucent and fragile after treatment, caution is needed during the following wash steps.\nDay 3 – Plug washing and β-Agarase treatment\nTiming: 9 h\nPlugs are extensively washed to remove any debris from the previous proteinase K treatment. The agarose is then melted at 68°C and the plug treated with β-Agarase to digest the agarose, releasing the DNA fibers into solution.\nWash plugs with TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCL, 1 mM EDTA pH=8).\nFill (pipette gently) 15 mL tubes with buffer to the very top of the tube to avoid air/bubbles which can damage the plug.\nPlace 15 mL tubes on rotating mixer set at 15 rpm for 1 h.\nUsing a spatula and large glass beaker or a cell strainer, gently remove each wash. Tilt the tube, pouring off the liquid using the spatula to retain the plug. Gently pour off the wash buffer, do not aspirate. Plugs can be easily damaged.\nPerform 3× 1 h washes on rotating mixer set at 15 rpm, removing the wash buffer after each wash.\nPerform final 1× 3.5 h wash for extensive washing.\nβ-Agarase treatment.",
    "Set two water baths at 68°C and 42°C.\nAdd 1 mL of 0.5 M MES (pH=5.5) into a 2 mL round bottom tube. A round bottom tube is necessary to avoid damaging the plug.\nUsing a spatula transfer each plug to a round bottom tube ensuring immersion in MES solution.\nIncubate tubes at 68°C for 20 min, ensure the plug is melted before proceeding.\nQuickly transfer tubes into 42°C water bath for 10 min.\nAdd 1.5 μL of β-Agarase to each tube while in the water bath.\nIncubate at 42°C for 16–18 h, making sure the tube is in a fixed position avoiding agitation.\nCritical: β-Agarase is stored at −20°C, to avoid local solidification when added to plug-MES solution, hold the β-Agarase in the pipette tip for 10 s before adding. Do not mix the DNA solution when adding the β-Agarase, this can damage the DNA which is now unprotected and easily suffers mechanical stress. Allow the β-Agarase to spontaneously diffuse in the DNA solution.\nCritical: The pH of the MES solution is critical and should be accurately determined in freshly made MES on the day of use. The MES pH dictates the density, degree of stretching and the specific binding of the DNA to various surfaces (Allemand et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). It can be varied and optimized in a range of pH 5.2–6.5 depending on the fibers required (Iyer et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nAlternatives: Heat blocks can be used instead of water baths, be aware of dehydration of small liquid volumes during long incubations and samples will take longer to reach required temperature compared to a water bath, keep this in mind during short incubations.\nCoverslip preparation continued – perform in the fumehood (Gallo et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Labit et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]).",
    "After overnight silane treatment, submerge coverslip rack in 70 mL of N-Heptane and place in a water bath sonicator for 5 min, as seen in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E.\nSubmerge coverslip rack in distilled H2O for 5 min in a water bath sonicator.\nAllow coverslips to dry uncovered, in the fumehood.\nSubmerge coverslip rack in fresh chloroform for 5 min in a water bath sonicator.\nDry the coverslips, in the rack using air gas. Stream air over the coverslips until all liquid has been removed and coverslips appear dry.\nStore protected from dust until use, at 20°C–25°C. We suggest a clean, plastic box, stored within a cabinet. See below note for length of storage.\nOptional: Quality control (QC) of fully prepared coverslips can be performed using lambda DNA and YOYO-1 staining. Most problems with DNA combing are a result of poor quality silanized coverslips, QC at this step is key to troubleshooting. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].\nNote: Coverslips are most effective when prepared fresh for each experiment. The positively charged coating degrades over time and can lead to inconsistent fiber binding (Demczuk and Norio, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nDay 4 – Combing and immunodetection\nTiming: 9 h\nA silanized glass coverslip is submerged into the DNA fibers solution and removed at a slow constant rate. These fibers are stretched and aligned while binding the silanized coverslip. The meniscus of the solution with the slow, constant rate of movement (300 μm/s) straightens and aligns each individual DNA fiber along the same axis (fibers are elongated at a constant rate of 2 kb/μm) (Michalet et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). Subsequent immunodetection steps with primary and secondary antibodies culminate in visualization of the fibers using a fluorescent microscope with one slide containing hundreds of individual DNA molecules.\nDNA fiber combing.",
    "Add 1 mL of 0.5 M (pH=5.5) MES solution to a Teflon reservoir for each sample.\nPour the DNA solution into the reservoir, do not pipette!\nUse a DNA combing machine, see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F, to submerge a coverslip into the DNA solution.\nUse a fine point tweezers to handle silanized coverslips so as not to damage the coating.\nClamp a silanized coverslip above a Teflon reservoir.\nSubmerge the coverslip in the DNA fiber solution.\nRemove the coated coverslip at a slow, constant rate. The Fiber Comb combing machine removes coverslips at a rate of 300 μm/s.\nReturn each combed coverslip to a rack.\nDehydrate coverslips in a 65°C incubator for 2 h. This ensures the DNA fibers are fully attached to the glass coverslip.\nCritical: Do not pipette the DNA solution into the reservoir, gently pouring will avoid damaging the delicate DNA fibers.\nNote: Ensure each reservoir is full of liquid, top up with 0.5 M MES if necessary. After combing, both sides of the coverslip are coated in DNA.\nOptional: Quality control of combed coverslips can be performed using YOYO-1 staining. This will confirm DNA fibers have bound to the coverslip and show the quality of the DNA fibers. The Fiber Comb machine can comb two coverslips at once into the same sample allowing one slide to be used for quality control YOYO-1 staining.\nNote: We use disposable Teflon reservoirs and the Fiber Comb machine purchased from Genomic Vision (www.genomicvision.com[href=http://www.genomicvision.com]), these can be built, or 3D printed in-house. How to build a combing machine is described in-depth by Gallo et al. A motorized platform with clamps to hold coverslips can be used as a non-commercial alternative, ensure the clamps remove the coverslips at a constant rate of 300 μm/s.\nImmunodetection.",
    "Denature combed coverslips using 0.5 M NaOH + 1 M NaCl (make fresh in water) for 8 min by submerging rack into solution into a glass beaker, as seen in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, and shaking on an orbital shaker, set at 75 rpm (use this setting for all future shaking steps).\nWash 3× by submerging rack in PBS – 2 min and shaking as above.\nDehydrate coverslips in 70% ethanol (freshly prepared) by submerging rack for 5 min and shaking as above.\nFurther dehydrate the coverslips in 100% ethanol for 5 min with shaking.\nDry coverslips on the bench for 30 min or until completely dry, meaning no droplets or liquid can be seen on the glass surface.\nBlocking: 5% BSA in PBS – submerge coverslips in rack into 5% BSA solution in a glass beaker and incubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nPrepare a moist box, shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A as follows:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1626-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Setup of humid chamber for antibody incubations\n(A–C) (A) Setup of a moist, plastic box, protected from light for antibody incubation of coverslips, (B) addition of antibody solution, (C) addition of coverslips on top of antibody solution. Purple color used for contrast and visualization in this image.\nUse a plastic box. If transparent, cover with foil (the secondary antibodies need protection from light).\nPlace parafilm on the bottom of the box.\nSurround the edge of the box with tissue paper, wet this tissue paper to maintain humidity in the box during incubations.\nPrepare primary antibody in 5% BSA, per sample: 40 μL BSA, 4 μL mouse anti-BrdU, 1 μL rat anti-BrdU (total= 45 μL per sample).\nIn this moist box, add 45 μL to parafilm (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B) and place coverslip on top (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C). Keep track of which side has antibody.",
    "Incubate at 37°C for 1 h.\nReturn coverslips to rack, keep track of orientation. Wash 3× in PBS – 5 min and shaking.\nPrepare secondary antibody in 5% BSA, per sample: 44 μL BSA, 0.5 μL anti-mouse Cy3, 0.5 μL anti-rat Cy5.\nAdd 45 μL to clean parafilm and place coverslip on top. Keep track of which side has antibody.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nReturn coverslips to rack, keep track of orientation. Wash 3× in PBS – 5 min and shaking, protect from light while washing.\nMount coverslips on microscope slides using 15 μL of Prolong Diamond Antifade.\nStore slides at 4°C for 24 h before imaging.\nOptional: Denaturation step can be adapted and optimized. NaOH denaturation is optimal for IdU visualization but is moderate for CldU. HCL can be used for denaturing and provides best visualization of CldU but does not work well for IdU. If NaOH denaturing results in limited CldU visualization, consider increasing the CldU concentration used (Iyer et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nOptional: All ssDNA can be fluorescently visualized alongside the nascent DNA fibers. This can be done using a layered approach, meaning the primary and secondary antibody incubations to detect IdU and CldU are completed and followed by a 30 min primary antibody incubation for ssDNA (Millipore MAB3868) and a 30 min secondary antibody incubation (BD Biosciences #746352) (Bianco et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]). This is necessary as all ssDNA antibodies available are either of mouse or rat origin. To ensure no cross-reactivity, the mouse ssDNA primary antibody is incubated separately with the secondary being a different isotype. After mounting, all ssDNA on the coverslip can be visualized using a blue-fluorescence lens. If available, other species of BrdU antibodies can be used along with mouse ssDNA antibodies to avoid this layered approach.",
    "Critical: The use of a moist box for incubations at 37°C is important to maintain humidity which prevents the DNA fibers from desiccation.\nDay 5 – Imaging and analysis\nDNA fibers are viewed and imaged using an epifluorescent microscope with a 60× objective. Using ImageJ software, the length of each tract is measured and a ratio of IdU/CldU represents the level of fork protection/degradation. A reduction in the IdU/CldU ratio indicates the IdU tract is shorter in length, implying degradation of the nascent DNA, and therefore, a deficit in fork protection.\nImaging - troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nVisualize fibers at 60× magnification using an oil immersion lens in an inverted epifluorescent microscope e.g., Keyence BZ-X800E.\nVisualize Cy3 labeled tracts with a TRITC filter and Cy5 labeled tracts with a Cy5 filter.\nOverlay both filters to produce images of entire DNA tracts, meaning both the CldU and IdU tracts.\nTake multiple images per sample, ensuring each field of view is separate, not overlapping. The number of images taken is determined by the density of fibers in each field of view, an average of 10–20 fields of view has proven sufficient in our studies.\nA minimum of 100 fibers per sample is needed for future analysis to ensure reliable estimation of fiber length accounting for the variability between fibers within a sample.\nInclude a scale bar for later quantification, 1 μm = 2 kilobases.\nAnalysis.\nAnalyze images using the Java-based image analysis program ImageJ, developed by the NIH.\nSet the global scale using a scale bar in μm.\nDraw a straight line across the scale bar.\nSelect Analyze, Set Scale.\nSet length of scale bar as Known Distance and the unit of the scale bar as the Unit of Length.\nSelect global.",
    "Using the line drawing tool measure the length of each tract (red/green) of each fiber, only include bicolored fibers i.e., fibers with both tracts.\nCalculate the ratio of IdU/CldU, with a minimum of 100 fibers measured for each sample.\nCritical: Avoid measuring fibers that are too short/long, non-consecutive or fiber bundles. These fibers are unreliable, and this can skew the data. See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] and troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nOptional: DNA fibers can be analyzed in many different ways using the length of the DNA tracts. Independent of the replication parameter being investigated, the data acquired are based on the lengths of the fluorescent DNA tracts. Length of individual tracts (red or green) can be analyzed, also the length of the entire DNA tract in total can be measured. Differences in tract length can provide information on many replication aspects such as the progression of the fork, stalling of the fork, the speed of the fork. To analyze the speed of the replication fork, the length of each tract, once measured, is converted from μm to kilobases, with the conversion factor of 2 kb/μm (Michalet et al., 1997[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). This conversion rate is specific for DNA combing method. The fork speed is then calculated by dividing the tract length by the labeling time (kb/min). Other dynamics such as replication fork restart, fork symmetry, new origin firing, interorigin distance, and ssDNA gaps can be investigated using DNA fiber combing. An example of origin firing in a DNA fiber is shown in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A. These approaches and analyses are reviewed in-depth by Quinet et al., in DNA Fiber Analysis: Mind the Gap!\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1626-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.
