  "procedures": [
    "Enteroids were derived from small intestinal samples from premature infants (born at 22 to 36 weeks gestation) obtained at the time of surgery for NEC or other intestinal conditions with non-inflammatory etiologies. All specimen collection and processing was performed after informed consent and approval from the Institutional Review Boards at Washington University in St. Louis (IRB Protocol numbers 201706182 and 201804040) and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (IRB protocol number 21-3134).\n1. Isolation and plating of crypts from human neonatal small intestine to establish enteroids\nMedia preparation\n\t\nPrepare all media required as described in Table 1. Ensure aseptic technique is used for the preparation of all media. Filter sterilize media using a 0.2 µm filter and store at 4 °C until use.\nWashing and mincing intestinal tissue\n\t\nPlace the cell culture matrix hydrogel on ice to thaw. Obtain human intestinal tissue from the operating room. Immediately place the sample in 5 mL of ice-cold tissue washing media to inactivate endogenous proteases.\nFlush intestinal contents with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (D-PBS) using a 10 mL syringe fitted with a trimmed P1000 pipette tip. Transfer the intestinal tissue to a 35 mm dish containing 5 mL of ice-cold D-PBS.\nCut the intestinal tissue longitudinally to expose the lumen, and cut it into small pieces using fine scissors. Rinse intestinal tissue by gently agitating in D-PBS in the tissue culture dish.\nTransfer tissue fragments to a clean 35 mm dish. Mince tissue with fine scissors. The optimal size is 0.5 cm2 per piece. The intestinal tissue should pass through a trimmed 1 mL pipette tip.\nDissociating intestinal tissue\n\t\nAdd 1 mL of prewarmed collagenase I to the tissue. Mix tissue with collagenase by pipetting 10-15 times, and transfer to a 15 mL conical tube.",
    "Secure the tube horizontally on a shaker set at 50 rpm. Shake for 20 min at room temperature.\nAfter the incubation, remove the tubes from the shaker, and resuspend the solution by pipetting 10-15 times. Optional: Remove a small aliquot to verify the presence of single crypts using phase contrast microscopy.\nIsolation of intestinal crypts\n\t\nFilter crypts through a 70 µm strainer into a 50 mL conical tube on ice. Wash the strainer with 9 mL of ice-cold tissue washing media. Transfer the filtrate to a 15 mL conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C, and gently remove the supernatant. There will be approximately 200 µL of media remaining in the tube. Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of the ice-cold tissue washing media.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of tissue washing media and transfer to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the crypts. Carefully and completely aspirate the supernatant as much as possible using a pipette. Place the tube on ice.\nPlating intestinal crypts\n\t\nResuspend the pellet in cell culture matrix hydrogel (20 µL/well of a 48-well tissue culture plate) using a pre-chilled pipette tip to make a homogenous suspension of crypts while the tube remains on ice. Avoid making bubbles when pipetting. Keep the tube on ice until ready for use.\n\t\tNOTE: The cell culture matrix hydrogel will polymerize at temperatures above 8 °C. Crypts isolated from a piece of intestinal tissue 0.5 cm-1 cm in length are generally plated in 10 wells of a 48-well tissue culture plate.",
    "Plate the crypt/cell culture matrix hydrogel suspension in a pre-warmed 48-well tissue culture plate. Warm the plate to aid in the solidification of the matrix. Place the suspension in the center of the well. Avoid bubbles when plating.\nIncubate the plates for 20 min at 37 °C to polymerize the matrix. It is essential for the cell culture matrix hydrogel to fully polymerize before adding media.\nAfter the matrix polymerizes, add 300 µL of pre-warmed 50% L-WRN conditioned media to each well. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nChange media every 2 to 3 days. Replace with warm 50% L-WRN conditioned media. Passage every 7 to 10 days. Passage enteroids when they are 50%-90% confluent and exhibit bud formation.\n\t\tNOTE: The media may need to be changed more frequently if it becomes yellow. The frequency of passage will depend on the enteroid density and the rate of growth of a particular patient's cells. Enteroids will need to be passaged if their centers turn dark in appearance.\nPassaging the enteroids\n\t\nGently aspirate media from the wells. Carefully wash wells with 500 µL of warm D-PBS. Be careful not to disturb the matrix.\nAdd 250 µL of cold cell recovery solution to each well. Scratch the bottom of each well with a fresh pipette tip to disrupt the cell culture matrix hydrogel. Incubate plate on ice for 30 min.\nDissociate enteroids by vigorous pipetting (~25-50 times with P200 pipette) and add 500 µL of tissue washing media.\nTransfer enteroid suspension into a 15 mL tube and add an additional 5 mL of cold tissue washing media. Pipette gently to form a homogenous solution.",
    "Centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the enteroids. Place the tube on ice and aspirate the supernatant as completely as possible. There will be approximately 30-60 µL remaining in the tube.\n\t\tNOTE: If there are difficulties breaking up the enteroids with pipetting, 0.25% trypsin-EDTA or enzymatic dissociation reagent can be utilized to facilitate this process.\nResuspend enteroids in the residual volume of wash media with a P200 pipette. Avoid bubble formation while pipetting.\nAdd 20 µL of cell culture matrix hydrogel per new well of a 48 well plate to the enteroid suspension. Split the enteroids 1:3, 1:4, or 1:5, depending on their density.\nAdd the suspension to a pre-warmed 48-well plate. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 20 min to solidify the matrix.\nAfter polymerization, add 300 µL of pre-warmed 50% L-WRN conditioned media to each well. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n2. Neonatal intestine-on-a-chip model\nNOTE: For detailed instructions on handling the microfluidic chips and using this equipment, please see the manufacturer's duodenum intestine-chip culture protocol37.\nMedia preparation\n\t\nPrepare all media required as described in Table 2. Ensure aseptic technique is used. Filter sterilize media using a 0.2 µm filter and store at 4 °C until use.\nDay (-3): Thawing and expanding human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMECs)\n\t\nThaw a vial of HIMECs and plate per the manufacturer's recommendations.\nCoat a 25 cm2 flask with gelatin-based coating solution for 2 min. Remove excess solution. Add HIMECs (approximately 0.5-1 x 106 cells) resuspended in 6 mL of HIMEC media to the flask. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nChange HIMEC media every 48 h. Add HIMECs to the endothelial (bottom) channel of the chip within 48-72 h of becoming 100% confluent.",
    "Day (-1): Activating and coating the chips prior to the addition of the enteroids\n\t\nReconstitute the chip activation reagent 1 (CR-1) powder to make CR-1 solution. Ensure CR-1 powder and chip activation reagent 2 (CR-2) solution are at room temperature for this step.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep the CR-1 powder and the CR-1 solution that is prepared in the following steps protected from light at all times. The light should be off in the hood for these steps.\n\t\t\nPlace the chip and chip carrier into the chip cradle, then place them in a tissue culture dish in the cell culture hood. See the manufacturer's protocol for the proper technique for chip placement in the carrier37.\nAdd 1 mL of CR-2 solution to the vial of CR-1 powder and then directly transfer the solution from the CR-1 powder vial to a 15 mL tube wrapped in aluminum foil to protect it from light. Do not mix the solution with the pipette. The goal is to avoid bubble formation.\nAdd another 1 mL of CR-2 solution to the CR-1 vial, and transfer to the 15 mL tube. Repeat for a total of 4 rinses and a total of 4 mL of CR-2 rinsed through the CR-1 vial. Add the cap to the vial and invert for the last rinse to remove any residual powder.\nAdd an additional 6 mL of CR-2 to the 15 mL tube containing CR-1 for a final volume of 10 mL (0.5 mg/mL). Mix this solution with a pipette without introducing bubbles. Ensure that CR-1 is fully dissolved prior to proceeding to the next step.\nAddition of CR-1 solution to chip\n\t\tNOTE: It is critical to avoid introducing bubbles to the channels while adding these solutions. CR-1 solution should remain protected from light for this step.",
    "Using a 200 µL pipette tip, add 20 µL of CR-1 solution to the bottom channel inlet until the solution begins to exit the bottom channel outlet. Add 50 µL of CR-1 solution through the top channel inlet until the solution begins to exit the top channel outlet. Remove any excess CR-1 solution from the surface of the chip by gentle aspiration.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Solutions should always be added to the bottom channel before the top channel. If bubbles are noted, flush both channels with CR-1 solution and repeat 2.3.2.1.\nIf the lid of the tissue culture dish containing the chips is in place, remove it for this step. Place chips under UV light for 15 min. Remove CR-1 from the top and bottom channels.\nRepeat steps 2.3.2.1 through 2.3.2.2 for a total of two UV activation steps. After this step, the chips are no longer light-sensitive.\nRemove CR-1 from the top and bottom channels. Wash both channels with 100 µL of CR-2 solution. Remove the CR-2 solution from the top and bottom channels.\nWash both channels with 100 µL of sterile D-PBS. Repeat the washes 2x. Add 100 µL of D-PBS to both channels. Remove excess from the surface of the chips but leave the channels full.\nCoat channels with the extracellular matrix.\n\t\t\nThaw fibronectin, collagen IV, and cell culture matrix hydrogel on ice immediately prior to this step and keep these solutions on ice for the remainder of this section.\nPrepare the following extracellular matrix (ECM) solutions for the top and bottom channels of the chip:\n\t\t\tTop Channel: 100 µL of 200 µg/mL of type IV collagen and 100 µg/mL of cell culture matrix hydrogel in D-PBS per chip.\n\t\t\t​Bottom Channel: 100 µL of 200 µg/mL of type IV collagen and 30 µg/mL of fibronectin in D-PBS per chip.",
    "Completely remove D-PBS from the top and bottom channels. Add 50 µL of ECM to the bottom channel inlet until a drop appears on the outlet. Repeat for the upper channel. Make sure to use the appropriate ECM solutions for each channel and add the solution to the bottom channel first.\nAdd D-PBS to the chip cradle reservoir and replace the lid on the tissue culture plate. Place the chips in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator overnight.\nDay (0): Seeding chips with HIMECs and enteroids\n\t\nVacuum equilibration of media\n\t\t\nAdd the required volume of HIMEC media and chip expansion media, to complete the experiment, to a sterile 50 mL conical tube. Equilibrate media to 37 °C in a water bath for at least 1 h.\nConnect the vacuum filtration device to 50 mL tubes containing warmed media. The tubes should be oriented with the prewarmed media at the bottom of the 50 mL conical tube. Vacuum at -70 kPa or higher for 10 s.\nFlip the tubes so that the media moves through the filter. Continue to vacuum for 5 min. Upon completion of vacuum filtration, remove the vacuum filtration device and place the 50 mL tubes containing media into the 37 °C incubator.\nWashing the chips\n\t\t\nWash the endothelial channel by flushing with 100 µL of prewarmed HIMEC media.\n\t\t\t​Wash the epithelial channel by flushing with 100 µL of prewarmed chip expansion media. Remove any media that spread onto the surface of the chips.\nRepeat washing step. Media should remain in the channels as well as inlet and outlet ports after these flushes. Replace the lid of the culture dish containing the chips and return to the incubator until ready for use.\nHarvesting HIMECs",
    "Aspirate media from the 25 cm2 flask containing HIMECs. Wash the monolayer gently with D-PBS. Add 2 mL of prewarmed 0.05% trypsin-EDTA to the flask and rinse gently over the monolayer.\nIncubate the flask at 37 °C for 2-5 min. Neutralize trypsin with 10 mL of HIMEC media. Resuspend cells in media and transfer to a 15 mL tube.\nSpin at cells 150 x g for 5 min. at 4 °C. Resuspend cells in 200 µL of HIMEC media.\nRemove 10 µL of cells and place the tube on ice. Count cells using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter. The desired concentration of HIMECs is 6 x 106 to 8 x 106 cells/mL.\nSeeding HIMECs onto the chip\n\t\t\nRemove the chip from the incubator and bring it into the hood. Aspirate any media that may have leaked on the surface of the chip.\nFlush the epithelial (top) channel of the chip with 100 µL of prewarmed chip expansion media. Flush the endothelial (bottom) channel of the chip with 100 µL of prewarmed HIMEC media.\nGently resuspend HIMECs to obtain a homogenous distribution. Completely remove the media from the endothelial (bottom) channel. Add 10 µL of HIMECs (~36,000 cells/chip) to the endothelial (bottom) channel.\n\t\t\tNOTE: If it is difficult to fill the HIMEC channel without bubble formation when using 10 µL of HIMECs, increase the volume of cells added. It should be the same number of cells per chip.\nAdd additional organoid growth media to the epithelial (top) channel if it is not full. Check the seeding density of the HIMECs. If they are not uniformly distributed and do not cover 80%-90% of the chip surface, flush the channel and repeat seeding.",
    "Invert the chip into the chip cradle in the cell culture dish. Add D-PBS to the reservoir in the chip cradle. Replace the lid to the cell culture dish and place it in the incubator.\nLeave the chip inverted at 37 °C for 2-3 h to allow HIMECs to attach to the chip membrane. After incubation is completed, return the chip/chip cradle to an upright position.\nGently wash the endothelial (bottom) channel with 100 µL of warm HIMEC media. Leave media in the channel. Gently wash the epithelial (top) channel with 100 µL of organoid growth media. Leave media in the channel.\nReturn chips to the 37 °C incubator while completing the next steps.\nHarvesting enteroids and seeding on chip\n\t\tNOTE: Chips are seeded with enteroids that were split 10-14 days prior, are 50%-75% confluent, and at passage 7 and 20. Please see Figure 2 for the appearance of enteroids on Day 0. The time required for enteroids to be ready for seeding will depend on the rate of growth of a particular patient's cells.\n\t\t\nGently aspirate media from the wells. Carefully wash wells containing cell culture matrix hydrogel with 500 µL of warm D-PBS. Be careful not to disturb the cell culture matrix hydrogel.\nAdd 250 µL of cold cell recovery solution to each well. Scratch the bottom of each well with a fresh pipette tip to disrupt cell culture matrix hydrogel. Add contents of wells to a cold 15 mL tube on ice.\nIncubate tube on ice for 45 min, and invert the tube every 3-5 min. During this step, prepare enteroid dissociation media. Place this media in the 37 °C water bath when 10 min are remaining in the incubation step.",
    "Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the enteroids. Remove the supernatant.\nAdd 2 mL of enteroid dissociation media per harvested plate to the pellet and place in a 37 °C water bath for 60 s to 120 s. Gently swirl tube during incubation. Incubate long enough to achieve fragmented enteroids but without dissociation into a single cell suspension.\nAfter incubation, add 10 mL of cold tissue washing media to each 15 mL tube. Centrifuge at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C to pellet the enteroids. Aspirate the supernatant completely.\nResuspend the pellet in 200 µL of chip expansion media. Dissociate enteroids by vigorous pipetting (~25-50 times with P200 pipette).\nCombine cells into a sterile 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Pipette gently to form a homogenous solution. The goal is to seed the chip with fragmented enteroids in small clusters of 10-30 cells.\nRemove 10 µL of cell suspension for counting. Place the remaining cell suspension on ice. Adjust the volume of chip expansion media to achieve a concentration of 6 x 106 cells/mL.\n\t\t\tNOTE: It may be necessary to centrifuge the enteroids and resuspend them in a smaller volume of media to achieve the required density.\nBring the microfluidic chips into the hood and aspirate the media from the epithelial (top) channel of the chip. Load the top channel of the chip with 30 µL of resuspended cells (~180,000 cells/chip). Ensure complete and uniform coverage of the epithelial channel of the chip for the formation of a monolayer. If this is not achieved, rinse the enteroids through the chip and reseed.",
    "NOTE: If there are difficulties achieving a uniform suspension while loading multiple chips, the enteroids can be separated into 40 µL aliquots in individual 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes. This will minimize variability in the enteroid numbers and fragment size as loading proceeds.\nReturn the chips to the chip cradle in the cell culture dish (if they have been removed). Add D-PBS to the reservoir in the chip cradle. Replace the lid to the cell culture dish, and place chips at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight.\nDay (1): Preparing pods and introducing flow to chips\n\t\nBring the chips into the tissue culture hood. Gently flush the epithelial channel twice with 100 µL of chip expansion media. Gently flush the endothelial channel twice with 100 µL of HIMEC media. Remove excess media from chip surface.\nPrime pods and regulate per the manufacturer's protocol37. Add 2 mL of appropriate media to the inlet reservoirs. Add 300 µL of the appropriate media to the outlet reservoirs. The flow rate will be 30 µL/h. Stretch will not be initiated yet.\nDay (2): Monitoring monolayer development and changing media\n\t\nPause the culture module and bring the pods into the hood.\nInspect chips and pods for bubbles. Examine the epithelial monolayer using a phase contrast microscope. Capture images in consistent locations across the chip to monitor progress. Image the chips while they remain in the pods.\nRemove the media from the upper channel inlet reservoirs and replace it with 2 mL of chip differentiation media. Add 1 mL of HIMEC media to the lower channel inlet reservoir. Leave enough media in the inlet reservoirs to ensure that the bottom of the reservoir remains covered with a thin layer of media.\nReturn the pods to the culture module and restart flow at 30 µL/h.",
    "Day (3): Monitoring monolayer development, initiating stretch, and adding media\n\t\nRepeat steps 2.6.1.1. and 2.6.1.2. Add 1 mL of chip differentiation media to the upper channel inlet reservoir and add 1 mL of HIMEC media to the lower channel inlet reservoir.\n\t\tNOTE: Remove media from the outlet reservoirs of both channels once they begin to reach 50-75% capacity.\nReturn the pods to the culture module. Restart flow at 30 µL/h, and initiate stretch at 2% strain and a frequency of 0.2 Hz.\nDay (4): Monitoring monolayer development, increasing stretch, and adding media\n\t\nRepeat steps 2.6.1.1. and 2.6.1.2. Add 1 mL of chip differentiation media to the upper channel inlet reservoir and add 1 mL of HIMEC media to the lower channel inlet reservoir.\n\t\tNOTE: Remove media from the outlet reservoirs of both channels once they begin to reach 50-75% capacity.\nReturn the pods to the culture module. Restart flow at 30 µL/h and increase stretch to 10% strain and a frequency of 0.2 Hz.\nDay (5) through Day (7): Monitoring monolayer development and adding media\n\t\nRepeat steps 2.6.1.1. and 2.6.1.2. Add 1 mL of chip differentiation media to the upper channel inlet reservoir and add 1 mL of HIMEC media to the lower channel inlet reservoir.\nReturn the pods to the culture module, and restart flow and stretch. Once villus-like axes are visualized, proceed to the NEC-on-a-chip model.\n3. NEC-on-a-chip model\nIntestinal bacteria culture\n\tNOTE: This step requires a pre-titrated frozen stock of enteric bacteria from a patient with NEC that is prepared in advance of initiating this protocol. For these experiments, a previously described polymicrobial enteric bacteria slurry from one patient with severe surgical NEC was used38.\n\t\nMake a 50% glycerol stock of enteric bacteria and store in a -80 °C freezer until further use.",
    "Thaw an aliquot of the intestinal bacteria and inoculate 10 µL into 3 mL of Luria-Bertani (LB) media. Incubate at 37 °C with shaking at 150 rpm overnight.\nOn the same day, gently wash channels with 100 µL of pre-warmed antibiotic-free chip differentiation media (top channel) or 100 µL of pre-warmed antibiotic free HIMEC media (bottom channel). Fully aspirate the medium and repeat flush for a total of 3 washes.\nAfter aspirating the third wash, replace the media in the channels and leave in place.\nRinse top and bottom channel inlet reservoirs with sterile D-PBS and then fill with 3 mL of the appropriate antibiotic-free media. Prime pods and regulate as in 2.5.2.\nReturn the chip to the culture module, and re-initiate stretch and flow.\nThe following morning, take 1 mL of the overnight bacterial culture and inoculate it into 25 mL of fresh LB media.\nReturn this new culture to the 37 °C shaker until the OD600 reaches 0.6 ± 0.02 measured using a 1 cm cuvette. Dilute the bacterial culture to 7 x 108 colony forming units/mL in antibiotic-free chip expansion media.\nSave an aliquot of this culture to confirm the concentration of the inoculum39. It may be necessary to adjust the concentration of the bacteria depending on the response of the epithelium.\nRemove the media from the epithelial (top) channel. Add 30 µL of the bacterial culture diluted in antibiotic-free chip expansion media to the top channel of the chip. Be very careful to avoid cross-contamination of the HIMEC (endothelial) channel with bacteria. Remove any extra media from the surface of the chip.",
    "Allow the chips to remain under static conditions for 30 min to facilitate bacterial adherence to the apical side of the neonatal epithelium. After the incubation, flush the top channel with 100 µL of antibiotic-free expansion media to remove unattached bacteria. Return chips to the culture module and re-initiate stretch and flow.\nEvery 24 h, remove the pods from the culture module, and slowly flush 100 µL of antibiotic-free chip expansion media through the epithelial channel. This will aid in preventing bacterial overgrowth.\n4. Intestinal permeability assay\nNOTE: This can be performed at any step during the protocol. If initiated when chips are seeded, the intestinal permeability assay can be used to serially assess monolayer confluence. If initiated upon the addition of intestinal bacteria, this assay can be used to determine the influence of intestinal bacteria on gut epithelial monolayer integrity.\nRemove media from the inlet reservoir for the epithelial (top) channel. Add appropriate media containing permeability dye (50 µg/mL) to the inlet reservoir. Use antibiotic-free chip differentiation media for the NEC-on-a-chip model.\nCollect the effluents from the epithelial and endothelial channels every 24 h. Quantify the concentration of permeability dye by using a microplate reader as per Lanik et al.36.\n5. Immunohistochemistry\nGently wash the bottom channel and top channel of the chip with 200 µL of D-PBS. Completely aspirate D-PBS from the channels.\nFix the cells by flushing both channels with 4% paraformaldehyde, leaving solution in the channels. Aspirate excess from the chip surface. Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nWash both channels with 200 µL of D-PBS. Leave D-PBS in the bottom channel and remove completely from the top channel.",
    "Permeabilize the epithelial layer by flushing the top channel with 100 µL of 0.1% detergent solution, leaving solution in the channels. Aspirate excess from the chip surface, and incubate at room temperature for 45 min.\nWash both channels with 200 µL of D-PBS. Leave D-PBS in the bottom channel and remove completely from the top channel.\nAdd 10% donkey serum (or an appropriate blocking agent) to the top channel for 1 h at room temperature. Wash both channels with 200 µL of D-PBS. Leave D-PBS in the bottom channel and remove completely from the top channel.\nDilute primary antibodies in 5% donkey serum and add to the top channel of the chip (antibodies and concentrations previously tested are available in Lanik et al.36). Incubate at 4 °C overnight.\nWash both channels 3x with 200 µL of D-PBS. Leave D-PBS in the bottom channel and remove completely from the top channel.\nDilute fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies diluted 1:200 in 5% donkey serum in D-PBS and either Hoechst 33342 or DAPI (nuclear stains). Add secondary antibodies to the top channel of the chip. Incubate at room temperature for 1 h, protected from light.\nWash both channels 3x with 200 µL of D-PBS. Leave channels filled with D-PBS after the final wash. Place the chip in an imaging dish with D-PBS for image acquisition using confocal microscopy.\n\t​NOTE: Fixed chips, either stained or unstained, can be stored at 4 °C for up to 1 week in PBS. Ensure channels do not dry up during this period.\n6. Isolation of RNA, preparation of cDNA, and quantitative real-time PCR\nGently wash the bottom channel and top channel of the chip with 200 µL of D-PBS. Completely aspirate D-PBS from the channels.",
    "Extract total RNA from the cells using an RNA extraction reagent per the manufacturer's instructions. To isolate RNA from the epithelium only, infuse through the top channel only.\nQuantify the RNA concentration using a nano-volume spectrophotometer. Reverse-transcribe 1 µg of total RNA. Perform quantitative real-time PCR. Primers previously used in this model are available in Lanik et al. 36.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
