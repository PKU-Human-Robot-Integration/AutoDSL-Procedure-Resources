    "1. Preparation for Formation of Alginate Discs\nPrepare a 4% (w/v) alginate solution in 1x Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline without added calcium chloride or magnesium chloride and place in a 37 °C water bath. Concentrations of the alginate solution can vary, but 1 - 4% (w/v) alginate solutions are recommended.\nMix the alginate solution at a ratio of 1:1 with warm cell culture media base (e.g., Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium) for the desired cell type. The alginate concentration is now half of the original concentration, i.e., 2% (w/v). Sterilize alginate/media solution using sterile 0.2 µm nylon syringe filters.\nPrepare a bath of sterile 102 mM calcium chloride dihydrate in sterile water with enough solution to submerge molds (~ 200 - 300 ml).\nCollect the sterile \"gel formation mold\" (6 mm diameter x 3 mm tall cylindrical wells in a 3 in x 3 in aluminum plate, see Figure 1) and endplates (Bottom: one 3 in x 3 in aluminum plate, Top: one 1.5 in x 3 in aluminum plate) and prepare molds as follows:\n\t\nCut thick filter paper (blotter filter paper) and the cell microsieve membrane (10 µm pore size) to the sizes of the top and bottom endplates and place them in the calcium chloride bath until saturated, approximately 1 min. If desired, sterilize the thick filter paper and the microsieve membrane via autoclave or ultraviolet light for 30 min prior to use.\nSet-up one half (the bottom half) of the mold construct.\n\t\t\nPlace the following items atop one another in the following order and smoothen using a sterile spatula: large endplate (3 in x 3 in), thick filter paper, and then the microsieve membrane.\nInvert and press the mold onto a stack of paper towels to ensure loss of excess calcium chloride solution.",
    "Place the \"gel formation mold\" with the cylindrical wells on top of the cell microsieve membrane and gently fasten the mold together on two sides using binder clips on the left and right sides. Make sure to leave enough room for the top endplate (1.5 in x 3 in) to cover the wells completely later.\nSet-up the second half (the top half) of the mold construct.\n\t\t\nPlace the following items atop one another in the following order and smoothen: small endplate, thick filter paper, microsieve membrane.\nInvert and press this half of the mold onto a stack of paper towels to ensure loss of excess calcium chloride solution. Do not fasten this half of the mold using binder clips at this time.\nCulture cells as recommended per manufacturer's instructions. Harvest the desired cells to embed in the layered alginate hydrogels. The recommended cell density is 1 - 2 x 106 cells/ml, but this can be varied depending on desired experiments.\n\tNote: When using this method for making layers with different cell types, make sure to culture two cell types in parallel for layering. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seeded at a cell density of 1 x 106 cells/ml will be used as an example for the following protocol. Cell number and disc number can be scaled for experiments as needed.\n\t\nOne to two weeks prior to embedding, seed mesenchymal stem cells at a cell density of 3,000 - 5,000 cells/cm2 in 10 ml of basal growth media (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum, 2% L-Glutamine, 1% Non-essential Amino Acids, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin) in T-75 flasks.\nRemove spent media every 2 - 3 days and replace with 10 ml of basal growth media until the cells are 80 - 90% confluent.",
    "To harvest cells, remove spent media, and pipette 3 ml of 1x Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline without added calcium chloride or magnesium chloride to rinse cells. Remove this solution, pipette 3 ml of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA onto cells growing in T-75 flasks, and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C. After cells have lifted from the adherent surface, add 6 - 9 ml of basal growth media.\nCentrifuge MSCs at 600 x g for 5 min at room temperature, aspirate the supernatant, and re-suspend in 1 - 5 ml of basal growth media. Count the cells using a hemocytometer using device instructions.\nRemove 1 x 106 cells from the total cell resuspension, centrifuge using the same conditions, and aspirate the supernatant.\n2. Formation of Cell Seeded Alginate Discs\nRe-suspend the cell pellet with 1 ml of the sterile alginate/media solution to achieve a cell density of 1 x 106 cells/ml. The cell-alginate mixture will be homogenously cloudy in appearance when cells are mixed in appropriately.\nPipette 130 µl of the cell-alginate mixture into six 6 mm diameter x 3 mm tall wells in the bottom half of the mold construct dropwise, so as not to create any bubbles. A slight convex meniscus should be visible above the edge of each well.\nCarefully smoothen the top half of the mold construct using a sterile spatula and turn it over, so that the cell microsieve membrane is on top of the wells. Place the mold construct on top of the wells, making sure to cover the wells containing the cell and alginate mixture completely.",
    "Lift the loaded mold construct and, while pressing down firmly on the center, binder clip the remaining two sides (top and bottom) to fasten the top and bottom halves of the mold construct. The cell-alginate solutions should be securely nestled in the wells at this time.\nImmerse the fastened mold construct in the 102 mM calcium chloride bath, making sure that the entire construct is submerged. Incubate in the cell culture hood at room temperature for 90 min.\nAt the end of the 90 min, remove the mold construct from the 102 mM calcium chloride bath and place on a stack of paper towels in the cell culture hood. Remove all four binder clips and separate the two halves of the mold construct. Hydrogels formed in the wells should not have any bubbles and should fill the wells completely.\nUsing a spatula, carefully trace the edge of the wells containing the hydrogels to carefully loosen and wedge out the hydrogels. After removing the hydrogels from the mold construct, drop the hydrogels directly into a bath of 1x Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline with calcium chloride and magnesium chloride. Cover the gels completely to wash off the excess calcium chloride solution for 1 - 5 min.\nTransfer the hydrogels into basal growth media solution in desired dish (e.g., 6 well plates) that completely covers the hydrogels. Incubate for at least 1 hr in the cell culture incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before continuing to the layering step.\n\tNote: Hydrogels containing cells can be kept in the cell culture incubator indefinitely at this time until layering of gels with another cell population is desired, provided that media changes are completed every 2 - 3 days.\n3. Layering of Alginate Discs",
    "During the last half hour of the 1 hr incubation, collect and prepare sterile molds and solution for annealing the gels.\n\t\nPrepare the \"cutting mold\" by fastening a mold that has wells half of the height of the \"gel formation mold\" (6 mm diameter x 1.5 mm tall wells in a 3 in x 3 in aluminum plate) to an endplate (3 in x 3 in aluminum plate) using binder clips on the left and right sides.\nPrepare the \"annealing mold\" by fastening a mold that is 3 mm larger in diameter than the \"gel formation mold\" (9 mm diameter x 3 mm tall wells in a 3 in x 3 in aluminum plate) to an endplate (3 in x 3 in aluminum plate) using binder clips on the left and right sides.\nPrepare a solution of 100 mM sodium citrate/30 mM EDTA (sodium citrate dihydrate, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt dihydrate) in sterile water.\nRemove gels of desired cell populations (in this example, two discs with hMSCs) from the media in the dish, and place into the \"cutting mold\" wells. Each gel should fit snugly into the wells with half of the gel protruding above the mold.\nUsing a scalpel, slice the gel along the surface of the mold (this will cut the hydrogel in half). Flip the top half of the gel and place it into an open mold well. The half of the gel should also fit snugly into the mold well, but now both half gels should be the height of the mold with the cut inner surface visible. Repeat with second gel.",
    "Note: Warning: Only the inner cut surfaces will form layered discs. Using the outer surfaces will result in the halves separating. It is suspected that texture from the microsieve membrane transferred onto the gel surface prevents success of the annealing process.\nPlace a piece of dry cell microsieve membrane on top of the wells, making sure that the microsieve membrane is in contact with all of the gel halves to be annealed and covering them entirely. Place thick filter paper on top of the microsieve membrane, making sure to cover the gels completely.\nPipette a solution of 100 mM sodium citrate/30 mM EDTA (Sodium citrate dihydrate, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tetrasodium salt dihydrate) onto the thick filter paper until it is saturated. Approximately 750 µl is sufficient for four wells.\nIncubate the gels for 1 min at room temperature. Then, remove the cell microsieve membrane and thick filter paper and discard them. Remove the binder clips and open the mold.\nFor each annealed gel, transfer one sodium citrate/EDTA-treated half of the hydrogel to the prepared \"annealing mold\" with the cut surface facing upwards. This will be one half of the annealed construct.\nUsing a spatula, lift and place a second sodium citrate/EDTA-treated half-gel (may contain a different cell type) onto the gel already in the \"annealing mold\", flipping this second half-gel so that the cut surface is in contact with the cut surface of the gel already in the \"annealing mold\".\nPress gently down on the two gels using a spatula to remove any bubbles between to the two gels. Also, reposition the gels as needed to make sure that they are directly on top of one another.",
    "Gently lift the \"annealing mold\" and submerge it in the 102 mM calcium chloride bath for 30 min. Do not cover the wells with an endplate.\nAfter the 30min incubation, remove the \"annealing mold\" and place it onto paper towels. Remove the binder clips and separate the mold from the endplate.\nUsing a spatula, collect the annealed gels and place them into a 1x Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline with calcium chloride and magnesium chloride bath to wash the gels. Subsequently, transfer annealed hydrogels to cell culture media in a desired dish (e.g., 6-well plate) for culture.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
