    "Sample preparationUsing a pipette, remove a 2 ml aliquot from the liquid culture, place in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube, and centrifuge at 13,000 x g for 10 min to pellet the cells.Remove and keep the supernatant; this is the extracellular medium that contains secreted organic acids. At this point the supernatant may be frozen at -20 °C for later HPLC analysis or analyzed immediately as described in the following steps.Filter 500-700 µl of the sample supernatant into chromatography vials using a 1 ml disposable syringe and a 0.45 µm-pore-size filter to remove particles that may interfere with the organic acid detection and potentially clog values and lines. Repeat individually for each organic acid standard sample that will be used to construct the standard curve. Cap the vials. These are now ready for HPLC analysis.HPLC procedureUse 8 mM H2SO4 as the mobile phase for isocratic elution. Sequentially increase the column temperature to 35 °C and then 45 °C using the Chromquest software (use a mobile phase flow rate of 0.1 ml min-1). Set the Refractive Index Detector to 50 °C. Once the column has reached 45 °C, download a method for measuring samples with the following settings. These settings are a standard protocol for the fermentation monitoring column; the only optimization is the increased run time to ensure the sample has completely eluted from the column. Surveyor LC pump: total flow, 0.5 ml/min; pressure limits, 0-1,100 psi; run time, 40 min.Surveyor PDA Plus: run time, 40 min; scans, 200-360 nm, scan rate, 1.0 Hz; bandwidth 1 nm.Surveyor AS: injection volume, 25 µl; needle height from bottom, 2.",
    "0 mm; syringe speed, 8 µl sec-1; flush speed, 70 µl sec-1; flush volume, 500 µl; wash volume, 300 µl; flush/wash source, 8 mM H2SO4 mobile phase; set tray temperature to 10 °C; enable column oven control temperature to 45 °C.Surveyor RI Plus: run time, 40 min; data rate, 10 Hz; temperature control set to 50 °C.Wait 10 min for baseline to stabilize, place vials in the autosampler tray, create a new sequence file for your run, autozero the PDA Plus and RI detectors, and start the run.Data analysisTypical chromatograms generated by the PDA Plus detector are shown in Figure 1. Similar chromatograms are generated by the RI detector. The organic acids secreted by different strains (Figure 1A) can be identified by comparing retention times to those of known standards (Figure 1B).Use the Chromquest software to integrate and quantify the area under each organic acid peak.Create a standard curve for each organic acid by plotting the peak area vs the known concentration. Example calibration curves are shown in Figure 2. Use the standard curves to calculate the concentrations of each organic acid in the supernatant samples. This will give the concentration of organic acid present in the extracellular media. Data can be normalized to cell count to determine the amount of organic acids secreted per cell.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160414/20160414035811_6500.pngFigure 1.

The retention times for each organic acid using our experimental procedure are as follows: α-ketoglutarate, 5.74 min; pyruvate, 6.52 min; succinate, 7.36 min; acetate, 9.51 min; α-ketoisocaproate, 10.45 min.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160414/20160414035851_7732.pngFigure 2.
