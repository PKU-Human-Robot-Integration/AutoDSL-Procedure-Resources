    "1. Surgical Retrieval\nNote: An IRB approval was obtained to collect the ACL stump during ACL reconstruction surgery. IRB exemption was given as the ACL stump used were generally discarded as surgical waste. 20 patients were used to collect the ACL stump.\nAdminister general anesthesia and pre-operative antibiotics as per institution's protocol to the patient.\nApply tourniquet and inflate 100 mg above systolic blood pressure.\nSituate the patient in the supine position. Make a horizontal anterolateral incision with knee in 30-45° flexion for a 5 mm portal and insert the arthroscopic trocar and camera into the suprapatellar pouch at 30°.\nPerform a routine diagnostic arthroscopy.\nEnter a notch and debride the membranous synovium over the torn ACL.\nUse a 4.5 mm shaver and ablator to identify the ACL stump.\nUse a duckbill straight bitter to collect multiple specimens from the remaining ACL stump.\nMaintain the sample in normal saline in a sterile container.\nSend the samples to pathology for decoding and final delivery to the laboratory facility.\nRecover patient and perform post-operative care as per institution's protocol.\n2. Tissue Digestion and hACL Isolation\nTransfer the human ACL tissue received from pathology to a Petri dish with sterile saline/PBS (Phosphate buffered saline).\nMince the tissue using sterile scissors into 1-2 mm3 pieces and wash the minced tissue with saline at least 3 times.\nDigest the minced tissue with 0.4% Collagenase in DMEM/F-12 (50/50, 1x) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin for 4-6 hr at 37 °C.\nCentrifuge the cells at 1,000 x g for 5 min and then resuspend the cells in the medium.\nWash the cells with the medium for 2-3 times and then seed/culture in T-25 flasks for 2-3 days.\n3. Cellular Expansion, Freezing and Thawing",
    "Use a light microscope to visualize the cells cultured for 2-3 days in a T-25 flask.\nMaintain the cells at 37 °C in the DMEM/F-12 (50/50, 1x) medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (P/S).\n\tNote: Change the media when cells show adherence and standard morphology. Use a light microscope to observe the cells.\nWash the confluent cells with PBS at day 7 (~1.3 X 106 cells/flask). Add Trypsin (0.5 g/L) and incubate the cells at 37 °C for 5 min. Add media to suspended cells to neutralize trypsin. Divide the media-cell mixture between three T-25 flasks.\nWash the confluent cells with PBS, add trypsin (0.5 g/L), and resuspend them in freezing medium containing DMSO, FBS and the complete medium (DMEM/F-12 Medium + 10% FBS + 1% P/S) in the ratio 1:2:7.\nStore the cryogenic vials at -80 °C if the cells will be used within a month, and in liquid nitrogen if the cells will be stored for longer durations.\nThaw the vials in a 37 °C water bath for reuse.\n\tNote: Typically 90-95% cells survive.\n4. Fabrication of Tissue Engineered 2-D Poly Lactic-co-glycolic Acid (PLAGA) Scaffold\nDissolve 1 g of PLAGA in 12 ml dichloromethane in a 20 ml scintillation vial and vortex the solution for 8 hr at a constant speed (800 rpm).\n\tNote: Detailed description in Gupta et al.15\nTransfer the dissolved solution to a glass Petri dish lined with Fluorinated protection paper.\nPlace the Petri dish under a vacuum hood for 30 min. Leave the Petri dish at -20 °C overnight and then at room temperature. Place the Petri dishes in lyophilizer to ensure complete evaporation of the solvent to obtain thin films of the polymer.\nPlace the polymer films in a desiccator for 24 hr.",
    "Cut the polymer films into 12 mm diameter circular disks and store them in a desiccator until needed.\n5. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)\nWash the cells (50,000 cells/disk) seeded on the control TCPS and the PLAGA scaffold with PBS 7 days subsequent to seeding.\nUse 1.5% Glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Cacodylate buffer to fix the cells and 2.5% OsO4 in 0.1 M Cacodylate buffer for post-fixation.\nWash the fixed cells with 0.1 M Cacodylate buffer. Dry the fixed cells using serial ethanol dehydration (50%, 70%, 80%, 90% and 100%) for 15 min each, and further dry in Hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) overnight.\nVent the chamber of SEM sputter coating system with button valve and raise the top plate.\nPlace the dried samples in chamber. Lower the top plate.\nSwitch the control knob to pump to start evacuating the chamber.\nOpen argon leak valve. Wait for the vacuum to drop to 0.05 mbar.\nCoat the dried samples with a thin layer (0.13 nm) of Gold/Palladium.\nReturn the argon leak valve to its closed position.\nSwitch the control knob to off.\nVent the chamber with button valve and raise the top plate.\nRemove the samples and store them in a desiccator for 24 hr.\nObserve the samples under an scanning electron microscope.\n6. Immunofluorescence Staining\nWash the cells (50,000 cells/disk) seeded on the control TCPS and the PLAGA scaffold with PBS 7 days subsequent to seeding.\nFix the cells using 70% ethanol (cold) for 10 min.\nIncubate the fixed cells at room temperature with 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in PBS having 0.05% Triton X-100 for 20 min.\nImmerse the samples in 1% Tween at room temperature for 20 min.\nAdd monoclonal mouse Anti-β-actin antibody (1:400) and incubate the cells overnight at 4 °C.",
    "Wash the cells with 0.05% Tween. Add secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse F (ab') 2 fragment of IgG conjugated with a fluorescence probe, 1:400) to the cells and incubate for 1 hr at room temperature.\nWash the cells with the PBS. Stain the cells with nuclear stain and mount using 80% Glycerol.\nObserve the cells under a confocal microscope.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
