    "The study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine (permission no. 202004A002). The study strictly followed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines on the Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication No. 85-23, revised 2011). Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats (weight, 300 ± 50 g; age, 12 ± 14 weeks) were used in this work.\n1. Animal preparation\nDeprive the rats of food and water for 12 h before surgery. Preoperative fasting aims to prevent pulmonary aspiration14.\nSterilize all instruments before surgery using a high-pressure steam sterilizer.\nAnesthetize the rats by administering pentobarbital sodium (1.5%, 75 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection (see Table of Materials).\nAssess the effectiveness of anesthesia by performing the pinch-toe test.\n\tNOTE: The rat is considered sufficiently anesthetized if no reflexes are observed when its hind paw is held by the tweezers.\nStraighten the middle section of two paper clips to form an \"S\" shape. Pull down the wide section of each \"S\" to form a small retractor.\nCut a 2 mm diameter polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tube into 7 mm-length pieces. Insert a 10 cm long 4-0 suture into the PVC tube, and tie its ends.\nLigate the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and the PVC tube together using a 6-0 suture. Cut a groove in the middle of the PVC tube using ophthalmic scissors, and use the groove to thread the 6-0 suture through the tube to prevent it from falling off.\n\tNOTE: The PVC tube and \"S\" shape retractors are shown in Supplementary Figure 1.\n2. Surgery procedure\nPerform surgery to generate the improved MIRI rat model following the steps below.\n\tNOTE: The animal model group generated by the improved MIRI method is referred to as the experimental model group throughout the article.",
    "After anesthesia (step 1.2), fix the limbs of the rat with tape by placing the rat on the surgical board in the supine position. Shave the neck and left anterior chest area with depilatory cream, and clean the skin with 75% alcohol and iodophor scrub.\nCut the skin of the neck lengthwise along the median cervical line using ophthalmic scissors.\nSeparate the neck muscles using ophthalmic tweezers, and place a retractor (step 1.4) on each side to retract them further.\n\t\tNOTE: It is necessary to expose the trachea adequately, as it is critical for preventing bleeding from the thyroid gland during this step.\nAfter exposing the trachea, identify the space between the fourth and fifth tracheal rings. This space is the puncture point.\nMark this point using the blunt edge of a needle tip. Make a 3 mm incision parallel to the cricoid cartilage at this point.\nInsert a suction trocar (see Table of Materials) into the trachea via the incision (step 2.1.5), and mechanically ventilate the rat to maintain normal respiration at a rate of 80 breaths/min and a tidal volume of 8 mL/kg.\nNext, make a 4-5 cm incision from the xiphoid to the middle of the second left intercostal space while holding the scalpel at a 45° angle. Gently and slowly, separate the pectoralis major and serratus anterior muscles using ophthalmic tweezers to access the intercostal space.\nMake a 1.5 cm incision transversely between the left third and fourth ribs using ophthalmic scissors.\nIf required, cut out the fourth rib to expose the heart covered by the left lung. This gives better visibility.",
    "To prevent injuries, place cotton balls soaked in the physiological saline solution above the lungs in the thoracic cavity. Dissect the pericardium using ophthalmic tweezers, lift the left atrial appendage by tweezers, and identify the coronary ostium present at the root of the aortic artery.\nIn the section between the left lung and auricle, ligate the LAD and the pre-prepared short tube (step 1.6) together using a 6-0 surgical suture, and tie it using a slipknot. Place the slipknot in the groove of the PVC tube, and tighten the ligated tube and LAD using a second slipknot for 45 min15 (Figure 1A,B).\nRecord the color change in the anterior part of the left ventricle and ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram (ECG) during the ischemia period.\n\t\tNOTE: The anterior part of the left ventricle turns pale during the ischemia period.\nClamp the chest muscles and skin using an artery clip, and cover the wound with moist saline gauze.\nLoosen the slipknot, and remove the pre-prepared short tube after 45 min15 (Figure 1C).\nKeep the rats anesthetized during reperfusion for 2 h.\nPerform surgery to generate the rat model following the previously published procedure16.\n\tNOTE: This animal model group is referred to as the existing model group throughout the article.\n\t\nBefore ligation of the LAD coronary artery, perform the same steps as the experimental model group.\nDuring the ischemic period, ligate each rat's proximal LAD coronary artery with a slipknot only using a 6-0 surgical suture at the same position as the experimental model group and tie a slipknot for 45 min.",
    "After the ligation, loosen the slipknot with tweezers, suture the incisions of the rat with a suture needle and tweezers, and keep the animal in deep anesthesia of 1.5% pentobarbital sodium throughout the period of reperfusion17,18,19 for 2 h before harvesting the rat's hearts.\n3. Assessment of triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining\nAt the end of reperfusion, the rats are euthenized while still deeply anesthetized. Sacrifice the rats and harvest their hearts16,20 immediately. Wash the hearts in PBS solution, and store them at −20 °C for ~20 min to harden the tissues.\nSubsequently, cut the hearts into 2 mm slices with a microtome blade, incubate them with 2% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) (see Table of Materials) at 37 °C for ~30 min, and fix them in 10% neutral formalin.\nPhotograph the heart slices, and calculate the infarct areas using an image processing program of ImageJ software (see Table of Materials).\n\t​NOTE: Due to the staining, the infarct sites appear pale white, whereas normal tissues appear dark red.\n4. Histological staining\nHarvest the hearts under deep anesthesia of 1.5% pentobarbital sodium at the end of the reperfusion period.\nFix the hearts in 10% formalin at 4 °C for 48 h.\nSubsequently, section the hearts with a microtome into at least 6 slices (5 µm thick) and ensure at least three slices for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and Masson staining20,21.\nObserve the slides under a light microscope, and photograph them.\n5. ECG assessment\nRandomly divide animals into experimental or existing MIRI model groups or sham groups to assess the ECG changes.\nAnesthetize all rats during the surgical ligations and assess standard limb lead II tracing20,21 to identify ECG changes and confirm myocardial ischemia.\nStore all images in a digital library.\n6. Statistical analysis",
    "Perform statistical analyses using scientific graphing and statistics software (see Table of Materials).\nExpress all data as mean ± standard error of the mean. After normality and lognormality tests of each group, perform a one-way analysis of variance and t-tests22 to determine significant differences among the groups. Consider p-value <0.05 as statistically significant."
