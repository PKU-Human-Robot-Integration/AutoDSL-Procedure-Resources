    "Design spacer-nick sgRNAs Note: For testing gene editing efficiencies of sgRNAs, you can select any available system that is suitable for your laboratory, such as T7EI (T7 endonuclease I) or Sanger sequencing following ICE analysis. Additionally, sgRNAs could be ordered as a pair of oligos, cloned into expression vectors, and tested in human cell lines such as HEK293T. You can also order synthetic sgRNAs, generate pre-assembled ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes of Cas9 nuclease and synthetic sgRNA, and perform in vitro T7EI assay on PCR amplicons. Define 5′ and 3′ areas flanking mutation hotspots (Figure 1) with a spacer distance of 200–350 bp.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4661/bioprotoc-13-08-4661-g001.jpgFigure 1. Design pools of spacer-nick sgRNAs. Scheme showing selected areas with a spacer distance of 200–350 bp, flanking a mutation. Pools of 5′ and 3′ sgRNAs with configurations of PAM sites facing outwards (PAM-out) are designed.Design pools of sgRNAs on the selected areas with a PAM-out configuration using CrispRGold software. In combination with the Cas9D10A nickase, 5′ sgRNAs nick the plus strand, whereas 3′ sgRNAs nick the opposite strand of the dsDNA molecule.Order designed sgRNAs, clone them into the suitable plasmids, and test gene editing efficiencies of these sgRNAs using T7EI assay or Sanger sequencing following ICE analysis.Select several pairs of PAM-out sgRNAs (one 5′ sgRNA and one 3′ sgRNA) with equal and high gene editing efficiencies (>80%) for the spacer-nick gene repair approach.Design DNA donor templates Note: In order to quantify gene correction efficiencies, we insert a diagnostic restriction enzyme site by introducing silent mutations into correct sequences or develop correct integration PCR, which allows us to amplify repaired and non-repaired alleles. To clone DNA donor fragments into the AAV genome vector, we inserted NotI sites into both ends of DNA donor fragments together with six random nucleotides.",
    "Design a DNA donor template carrying 5′ and 3′ HAs of at least 0.5–1.5 kb outside of each nick site (Figure 2).In order to minimize a mini-homologous sequence (highlighted in green; Figure 2) between two nick sites, we modify this sequence by introducing silent mutations (in case of repairing mutations in coding exons) or by partially ablating this sequence (in case of inserting cDNA into loci).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4661/bioprotoc-13-08-4661-g002.jpgFigure 2. Design the DNA donor template. Scheme showing configuration of the DNA donor template that carries 5′ and 3′ homology arms, flanking a modified sequence (marked in green) for gene correction and NotI sites at both ends for cloning into the pAAV vectors.Add NotI restriction enzyme sites to both ends of the DNA donor template.Order the dsDNA template from IDT.Generation of spacer-nick RNPs Note: We calculated the amounts of sgRNAs and Cas9D10A nickase for a reaction of 20 μL electroporation. For a reaction of 100 μL electroporation, scale up proportionally. Order crRNAs, tracrRNA, and Cas9D10A nickase from IDT.Generate sgRNA complex by mixing 20 μL of each crRNA (100 pmol) with 20 μL of tracrRNA (100 pmol) at a molarity ratio of 1:1 in a PCR tube.Incubate the mixture at 95 °C for 5 min and ramp down at a rate of 1 °C/s to room temperature in the thermocycler.Store sgRNA complexes at -20 °C up to six months or -80 °C up to one year.Generate RNP complexes by mixing 2 μL of sgRNA (100 pmol) with 0.75 μL of Cas9D10A nickase (~50 pmol) at a molarity ratio of 2:1 in a PCR tube and incubate the mixture at 25 °C for 10 min in the thermocycler.Note: Assembled RNPs should be freshly made before use.",
    "Production and purification of AAV6 donor vectors Note: We recommend using high-fidelity KOD hot-start DNA polymerase for PCR amplification of the DNA donor template. However, you can use any high-fidelity DNA polymerases that are available in your laboratory. Production and purification of AAV6 donor vectors are described in detail in our previous protocol (Tran et al., 2020).Amplify the NotI-containing dsDNA donor template (step B4) with specific forward and reverse primers (carrying six random nucleotides, NotI site, and target-specific sequence) using any high-fidelity DNA polymerases.Purify PCR products using NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Cleanup kit.Digest PCR products with NotI restriction enzyme and load on 0.8% agarose gel.Cut digested dsDNA band and purify it using any gel extraction kit.Clone the purified dsDNA template into NotI-linearized pAAV vectors using T4 DNA ligase.Transform the cloned pAAV vectors into competent TOP10 bacteria using heat-shock method.Spread transformed bacteria on 10 cm LB agar dishes containing 50 μg/mL of carbenicillin and culture these dishes in a bacterial incubator at 30 °C overnight.Pick bacterial colonies and inoculate these with 2 mL of liquid LB medium containing 50 μg/mL of carbenicillin at 30 °C overnight in a bacterial incubator with shaker.Extract plasmids using any plasmid purification kit and confirm the insert by Sanger sequencing.Produce large quantities of pAAV donor vectors using NucleoBond Xtra Maxi kit.Transfect, purify, concentrate, and calculate copy number of AAV6 donor particles following our previous protocol (Tran et al., 2020).Culture human HSPCs Note: In order to achieve sufficient expansion of human CD34+ cells, we recommend that you culture ~4 × 105 HSPCs per 2 mL in a well of a 6-well plate and monitor the culture every day until these cells are used for electroporation. In case expanded cells are at high density, you should split them into new wells of a 6-well plate.",
    "Isolate human CD34+ HSPCs from mobilized peripheral blood or bone marrow of healthy donors or patients using Ficoll-Paque Plus and follow human CD34+ microbead kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Freeze isolated CD34+ HSPCs in serum-free freezing medium (BAMBANKER) at a density of 1 × 106 per milliliter and store in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.Thaw frozen vials and culture CD34+ HSPCs at a density of 4 × 105 per 2 mL of completed serum-free StemSpanTM SFEM II medium in a well of a 6-well plate.Exchange half of the old medium with new medium 24 h post culture.Seventy-two hours post culture, harvest expanded HSPCs and count cell number using TC20 cell counting system.Transfer 2 × 105 HSPCs to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and spin down at 300 × g for 5 min.Remove supernatant, wash the cell pellet two times with room temperature PBS, and proceed to Section F or Section G.RNP and dsODN electroporation for Tn5-mediated GUIDE-seq Note: Prepare 1 mL of pre-warmed medium by adding 1 mL of completed serum-free StemSpanTM SFEM II medium to a well of a 12-well plate and place it into an incubator at 37 °C prior to electroporation. For long-term storage, annealed dsODN should be stored at -80 °C. Order forward and reverse oligos of dsODN as previously described (Tsai et al., 2015) from IDT.Anneal two oligos of dsODN by mixing 50 μL of each oligo (100 pmol), incubate at 95 °C for 5 min, and ramp down at a rate of 1 °C/s to room temperature in the thermocycler.After the last wash with PBS in step E7, remove supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet with 20 μL of P3 Primary Cell electroporation buffer by pipetting up and down 10 times.Add 2.75 μL of 5′ and 3′ assembled RNPs (step C5) and 0.",
    "5 μL (25 pmol) of the annealed dsODN to cell suspension and mix well by pipetting up and down five times.Transfer the mixture to a well of a 16-well nucleocuvette strip.Electroporate the cells using the DZ-100 program of Lonza 4D-Nucleofector.Transfer the electroporated cells to pre-warmed serum-free StemSpanTM SFEM II medium.Place the cell plate into an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Change medium every 2–3 days.At day 10 post electroporation, harvest the edited HSPCs by pipetting up and down five times, transfer cell suspension to a 15 mL Falcon tube, and spin down at 300 × g for 5 min.Wash the cell pellet three times with room temperature PBS.Deplete the dead cells by using dead cell removal kit and follow manufacturer’s specifications.Isolate gDNA using GenFind V3 reagent kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.Measure concentration of gDNA using NanoDrop and dilute gDNA to 20 ng/μL.Check quality of gDNA by loading 500 ng of gDNA on 0.8% agarose gel (Figure 3) and proceed to Section H.Note: In order to achieve good results of Tn5-mediated DNA tagmentation, we recommend using GenFind V3 kit for gDNA isolation. This kit yields high quality of gDNA, and DNA fragment size is >20 kb (Figure 3). However, you can also use other gDNA isolation kits with equal quality that are available in your laboratory. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4661/bioprotoc-13-08-4661-g003.jpgFigure 3. Quality control of the genomic DNA. 500 ng of gDNA of samples #1 and #2 are loaded on 0.8% agarose gel. GeneRuler 1 kb Plus DNA ladder is used as a marker. Optimal length of gDNA fragments is >20 kb.RNP electroporation and AAV6 infection for LAM-HTGTS Note: We normally infect the electroporated HSPCs with rAAV6 donor vectors at a MOI of 1 × 105 genome copy/cell. Higher MOI leads to cell death; we recommend carefully titrating your rAAV donor particles.",
    "At the last wash with PBS in step E7, remove supernatant and resuspend 2 × 105 HSPCs with 20 μL of P3 Primary Cell electroporation buffer by pipetting up and down 10 times.Add 2.75 μL of 5′ and 3′ spacer-nick RNPs (step C5) to cell suspension and mix well by pipetting up and down five times.Transfer the mixture to a well of a 16-well nucleocuvette strip.Electroporate the cells using the DZ-100 program of Lonza 4D-Nucleofector.Transfer the electroporated cells to pre-warmed completed serum-free StemSpanTM SFEM II medium.Place the plate into an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.Fifteen to thirty minutes later, add rAAV6 donor particles to the well containing the electroporated cells at a MOI of 1 × 105 genome copy/cell.Change half the medium with new completed serum-free StemSpanTM SFEM II medium 6–8 h after AAV infection.Change medium every 2–3 days.At day 18 post infection, harvest the cells by pipetting up and down five times, transfer cell suspension to a 15 mL Falcon tube, and spin down at 300 × g for 5 min.Wash the cell pellets three times with room temperature PBS.Deplete dead cells by using dead cell removal kit following manufacturer’s specifications.Isolate gDNA using Wizard Genomic DNA purification kit (see the note at step F15) and proceed to Section I.Tn5 transposase-mediated GUIDE-seq Note: Accurate concentration of gDNA is essential for reproducible Tn5-mediated tagmentation. We describe a Tn5-tagmented DNA protocol for exactly 100 ng of gDNA. If you want to conduct the protocol for more or less than 100 ng of gDNA, you should optimize these conditions. The Tn5-mediated DNA tagmentation should produce DNA fragments in the range of 300–1,500 bp. If DNA fragments are smaller or larger than this, you should reduce or increase the incubation time for the tagmentation, respectively.",
    "Importantly, you must carry out the Tn5-mediated DNA tagmentation at room temperature; do not use vortex for mixing. Primers used in this protocol are the same as described in Tran et al. (2022). Add the following reagents stepwise to a well of an 8-well PCR strip as in Table 2:Table 2. Tn5-mediated DNA tagmentation table:",
