    "The following methods describe sample preparation and experimental setup needed to perform UV-visible absorption, CD, thermal denaturation (both secondary structure and [4Fe-4S] cluster), EPR, and ICP-AES. These protocols have been successfully demonstrated on the CCIS protein and helix-1 of CCIS (Jagilinki et al., 2020). These methods can be used in general for any natural and artificial [4Fe-4S]-binding proteins.UV-visible spectroscopySwitch on the UV-visible spectrophotometer.Open the spectra manager suite and under the settings tab, update the following information: Start, 800 nm; stop, 260 nm; average time, 0.1 sec; data interval, 1 nm; and scan rate, 600 nm/min.Add 1-2 ml of buffer A into a 1 cm path quartz cuvette and record the background blank spectrum between 800 and 260 nm.Add 1-2 ml of 100-200 µM holo-CCIS in buffer A into a 1 cm path quartz cuvette (Figure 1A) and seal with an airtight cap inside the anaerobic chamber; transfer the cuvette into the UV-visible spectrometer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4202/bioprotoc-11-20-4202-g001.jpgFigure 1. Airtight cuvette for UV-visible spectroscopy. A. A 1 cm path length quartz cuvette with airtight cap for performing UV and CD in visible region. B. UV-visible spectra of CCIS protein.Record the spectra between 800 and 260 nm, subtracting the buffer A spectrum from the sample spectrum.Typical [4Fe-4S] spectra contain a significant peak with absorbance maxima between 395 and 400 nm and a characteristic shoulder between 320 and 360 nm (see Note 1). Refer to Figure 3(A) inset in         Jagilinki et al. (2020)         or Figure 1B.Turn off the UV-visible spectrophotometer.CD spectroscopy in far UVBefore switching on the CD spectrometer, turn the nitrogen flow into the CD spectrometer and let it purge for at least 30 min.During this time, exchange the protein buffer to buffer B using a PD-10 column (see Note 2).",
    "Cut the bottom tip of the PD-10 column and drain off the liquid from the column through gravity flow inside the anaerobic chamber.Pass 50 ml of buffer B to equilibrate the column, then load 2.5 ml of protein and allow it to enter the PD-10 column.Then, intermittently add 1 ml of buffer B and start collecting protein from 3 ml to 6 ml.If the protein concentration is higher and more than required, dilute with buffer B until the concentration reaches 10-20 µM.Switch on the CD spectrometer and set the following parameters in the Chirascan Q100 Software: bandwidth, 1 nm, and digital integration time, 2 s. Ensure that there is an uninterrupted flow of nitrogen into the CD spectrometer throughout the duration of the experiment.Add 200-300 µl of buffer B into a 1 mm path quartz cuvette and record the background blank spectrum between 250 and 195 nm.Add 200-300 µl of 10-20 µM protein into a 1 mm path quartz cuvette and seal with an airtight cap inside the anaerobic chamber; transfer the cuvette into the CD spectrometer.Record the spectrum between 250 and 195 nm, subtracting the blank spectrum.Record the spectra for both holo and apo forms of the protein (see Note 3).A typical far UV spectrum of α-rich helical proteins contains two prominent negative bands at 222 and 208 nm (see the traces in Figure 2A), whereas a typical far UV spectrum of β-rich proteins has one major broad dip between 215 and 218 nm.After performing the CD experiments, close the CD program and turn off the CD spectrometer. Allow the nitrogen inflow into the CD spectrometer for another 15 min, before turning off the nitrogen flow.To convert the CD values into Mean Residue Ellipticity, use the following equation:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20211017/20211017225323_6893.",
    "png where,MRE stands for Mean Residue Ellipticity,(θ) is the ellipticity in degrees,C is the molar protein concentration,N is the number of amino acids in the protein,l is the optical path length in cm.CD spectroscopy in visible regionBefore switching on the CD spectrometer, turn the nitrogen flow and purge it for at least 30 min.Add 1-2 ml of buffer B into a 1 cm path quartz cuvette and record the background blank spectrum between 800 and 300 nm.Add 1-2 ml of 200 µM protein into a 1 cm path quartz cuvette (Figure 1A) and seal with an airtight cap inside the anaerobic chamber; transfer the cuvette into the CD spectrometer.Record the spectrum between 800 and 300 nm subtracting the blank spectrum (see Note 4).A typical [4Fe-4S] CD spectrum in the visible region contains two significant troughs at approximately 360 nm and 550 nm and a characteristic crest between 430 and 440 nm (see the traces in Figure 2B). For CD spectra in the visible region for other types of clusters, refer to         Freibert et al. (2018)        .imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4202/bioprotoc-11-20-4202-g002.jpgFigure 2. Thermal denaturation profiles. A. Thermal denaturation profile of helix-1 of CCIS in the far UV region to determine the thermal stability of the secondary structure of the protein. B. Thermal denaturation profile of helix-1 of CCIS in the visible region to determine the thermal stability of the [4Fe-4S] cluster.Thermal denaturation using CD spectroscopy in far UVAfter recording the CD spectrum in the far UV region, as mentioned in section B, initiate the thermal kinetics program within the CD operational software.Set the temperature range between 20 and 90°C with intermittent steps of 2°C between scans. Allow the sample to incubate for at least 5 min at each temperature.Start the thermal denaturation program.",
    "Record for both holo and apo forms of the protein individually (see Note 5).Select a specific wavelength from the above experiment (222 nm for α-helical proteins or 218 nm for β-sheet proteins) and plot a trace against the temperature on the X-axis to determine the melting temperature (Tm) of the protein (see Note 6).Thermal denaturation using CD spectroscopy in the visible regionAfter recording the CD spectrum in the visible region, as mentioned in section C, initiate the thermal kinetics program within the CD operational software.Set the temperature range between 20 and 90°C with with an increment of 2°C between scans. Allow the sample to incubate for at least 12 min at each temperature (see Note 7).Start the thermal denaturation program. Perform the experiment only for the holo-protein.Select a specific wavelength from the above experiment (typically between 400 and 450 nm) and plot a trace against the temperature on the X-axis to determine the melting temperature (Tm) of the iron–sulfur cluster within the protein (see Note 6).Iron-sulfur cluster identification within the CCIS by EPRIron-sulfur cluster in its resting redox state, [4Fe-4S]2+, is diamagnetic and EPR-silent. For EPR characterization, the iron-sulfur clusters are reduced to paramagnetic state [4Fe-4S]1+ using sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4) (see Note 8).Prepare two EPR samples in the anaerobic chamber: one in the resting state [4Fe-4S]2+ and the second in the dithionite-reduced state [4Fe-4S]1+. For each sample, use 200 µl of 200 µM holo-CCIS in buffer C (see Note 9). For the dithionite-reduced sample, add 8-10 µl of 1 M sodium dithionite (Na2S2O4).Mix the solution properly in an eppendorf tube and transfer the resting and reduced state samples into clean EPR quartz tubes; seal the open end of the tubes with an airtight rubber cap.Take out the EPR tube from the anaerobic chamber and immediately freeze in liquid nitrogen.",
    "Keep the samples frozen at all times.Record the continuous-wave (cw) EPR spectra of the reduced and resting state samples at 10-30 K using a rectangular EPR resonator (Bruker 4102ST) and Oxford helium-flow cryostat (ESR900).Apply the following experimental conditions: microwave power, 0.2-2 mW, and modulation amplitude, 1-2 mT.Confirm absence of any EPR signal for the holo-protein sample in its resting redox state, [4Fe-4S]2+.A typical EPR spectrum of sodium dithionite reduced [4Fe-4S]1+ protein exhibits an axial EPR line shape consisting of two major peaks and showing up at magnetic fields corresponding to g|| (g1) with average values between 2.08 and 2.04 and g⊥ (g2,g3) with average values between 1.94 and 1.90. Refer to Figure 3(B) by         Jagilinki et al. (2020)         or Figure 3. For EPR spectral properties of other types of iron-sulfur clusters, refer to         Bertini et al. (1995)        .imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4202/bioprotoc-11-20-4202-g003.jpgFigure 3. EPR spectra of CCIS. The EPR spectra of CCIS protein with g values indicating the presence of [4Fe-4S] cluster within the protein.To accurately determine the characteristic g-factor values of the [4Fe-4S]1+ signal, perform the EPR signal simulations using the EasySpin toolbox developed for Matlab (Stoll and Schweiger, 2006).The quantitative yield of reduced [4Fe-4S]1+ clusters in the holo-peptide sample can be determined through spin counting analysis, where the integrated intensity of recorded [4Fe-4S]1+ is compared to the integrated intensity of the signal in an EPR-standard sample with a known number of spins (see Note 10). These analyses can be performed directly in the Xepr (Bruker) software.ICP-AES to determine the amount of iron and sulfur in the CCIS proteinSubject 100 μl of 1 mg/ml of CCIS protein in buffer A to acid hydrolysis using 50% HNO3 in a clean glass test tube inside a water bath at 90°C.Following overnight acid hydrolysis, dilute the sample using double distilled water.",
    "The final volume of the sample is 3.7 ml, and the final concentration of HNO3 is approximately 2.5%.Centrifuge the sample in 1.7 ml Eppendorf tubes at 4,427 × g for 5 min at 4°C.Buffer A is treated in the same way as Steps G1-G4.Make serial dilutions of the standard samples in the range of 0.1-5.0 ppm for iron and 0.5-100 ppm for sulfur, using 2.5% HNO3 (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4202/bioprotoc-11-20-4202-g004.jpgFigure 4. Standard curves from ICP-AES. A. The standard curve of Iron. B. The standard curve of Sulfur.Collect the data by selecting the wavelength 238.204 nm for quantifying iron content. Record for both standard, protein, and buffer individually.Similarly, collect the data for quantifying sulfur by selecting 181.972 nm.Subtract the corresponding blank values to determine the exact content of iron and sulfur individually.Plot standard graphs for iron and sulfur individually and determine the values for the protein sample."
