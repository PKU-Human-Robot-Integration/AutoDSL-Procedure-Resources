Fluorescent gelatin matrices are also used for podosome and invadopodia studies (see Figure 1).\n\t\nUnder a sterile laminar flow hood, place a piece of parafilm (20 cm x 15 cm) on the work area and disinfect it with 70% ethanol.\nAliquot 20 µL droplets of 1 mg/mL gelatin in a line, spaced approximately 1 cm apart; refer to Figure 1 for droplet organization.\nCover each 20 µL gelatin droplet with an autoclaved glass coverslip (12 mm in diameter).\nIncubate for 20 min at room temperature. If the gelatin is fluorescent, protect it from light.\nAliquot 40 µL droplets of 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in a line, each spaced approximately 1 cm below the line of coverslips from step 1.1.3.\n\t\tCAUTION: Glutaraldehyde is a toxic fixative agent. Use gloves and do not inhale.\nUsing jeweled forceps, transfer each gelatin-coated coverslip to a glutaraldehyde droplet.\n\t\tNOTE: It is normal that a small gelatin droplet remains on the parafilm. Do not reuse this for another experiment.\nIncubate for 40 min at room temperature. For fluorescent coverslips, protect them from light.",
    "Take a 24-well cell culture plate and fill each well with 500 µL of sterile 1x PBS. Place the coverslips, gelatin side up, into each well.\nWash twice in 1x PBS for 5 min each.\n\t\tNOTE: At this step, the coverslips can be used for experimentation or stored in 1x PBS at 4 °C. Non-fluorescent coverslips can be stored for one week, and fluorescent coverslips can be stored for 48 h.\nFibrillar collagen type I matrix\n\tNOTE: Fibrillar collagen type I matrix is used to study linear invadosome formation and the associated matrix degradation. A combination of fluorescent collagen I and non-fluorescent gelatin coverslips is used to colocalize invadosome markers with collagen fibers (e.g., F-actin in the far-red channel, collagen I in the red channel, Tks5 in the green channel, and Hoechst dye for a nuclear stain). On the other hand, a combination of non-fluorescent collagen I with non-fluorescent gelatin coverslips is used to maximize the number of invadosome markers stained (e.g., F-actin in the far-red channel, cortactin in the red channel, Tks5 in the green channel, and Hoechst dye for a nuclear stain). Finally, a combination of non-fluorescent collagen I with fluorescent gelatin coverslips is used to quantify the gelatin-associated degradation (e.g., F-actin in the far-red channel, Tks5 in the red channel, in the green channel, and Hoechst dye for a nuclear stain) (see Figure 1). Hoechst dye is used to stain the nucleus, and it also checks for mycoplasma contamination, in addition to a PCR test done regularly on the cell lines used.\n\t\nFluorescent collagen I\n\t\t\nUse commercial collagen I extracted from rat-tail tendon in 0.02 N acetic acid. Withdraw the quantity of collagen I necessary to prepare 500 µL of solution per coverslip at a final concentration of 0.4 mg/mL of collagen I.",
    "Add 5-carboxy x rhodamine succinimidyl ester at a final concentration of 10 µg/mL, calculated for the final volume of collagen I solution (n x 500 µL).\nMix the solution by pipetting up and down and incubate for 5 min at room temperature, protected from light.\nDilute to the final volume with 1X Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (DPBS) containing calcium and magnesium, and use directly.\nFibrillar collagen I coverslip\n\t\t\nUse the non-fluorescent or fluorescent gelatin coverslips previously prepared in step 1.1.\nPrepare a solution of fluorescent or non-fluorescent collagen I at a final concentration of 0.4 mg/mL in 1X DPBS containing calcium and magnesium.\nAdd 500 µL of fluorescent or non-fluorescent collagen I solution per coverslip in a 24-well cell culture plate.\nIncubate for 4 h at 37 °C for collagen I polymerization.\nAfter incubation, remove the excess collagen I by tilting the plate and pipetting on the side of the well (not directly on the coverslip) to avoid damaging the matrix.\n\t\t\tNOTE: This matrix cannot be stored. Seed the cells immediately after removing excess collagen I.\n2. Cell seeding, time of culture, and fixation\nDepending on the cell type, prepare the cells in the appropriate culture medium and add cells for a final volume of 500 µL per well.\nTo characterize the ability of a cell line to form linear invadosomes and to degrade the matrix, plate the cells for 4 h, 12 h, and 24 h on collagen I matrix to determine the kinetics of linear invadosome formation and the associated degradation activity.\n\tNOTE: Table 1 contains examples of cell lines tested in the laboratory.\n\ttable:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nCell line,Number of cells per coverslip,Time of contact with matrix for linear invadosome quantification,Time of contact with matrix for quantification of linear invadosome degradation activity\nMDA MB 231,40000,4 h,12 h\nHUH7,40000,12 h,24 h",

This table presents a non-exhaustive list of cell lines used to study linear invadosomes. It indicates the number of cells to seed on the matrix, the time necessary to observe linear invadosomes, and the time necessary to observe the associated matrix degradation. Linear invadosomes have a short lifetime. To be able to observe linear invadosomes in the maximum number of cells, the cells have to be in contact with the collagen I matrix for a short period of time. On the other hand, to be able to visualize the reported gelatin degradation, the cells must be in contact with the collagen I matrix for a longer period of time than those listed above.\nAfter the removal of the cell culture medium, fix the coverslips for 10 min in 500 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde in 1X PBS.\nWash twice with 1x PBS.\nStore at 4 °C, protected from light.\n3. Immunofluorescence\nPermeabilize the cells for 10 min with a freshly prepared solution of 0.2% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS. Do not reuse this solution.\nWash the coverslips twice with 1x PBS.\nPlace a piece of parafilm (20 cm x 15 cm) on the bench.\nDilute primary antibody in 4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in 1x PBS, as described in the Materials Table.\nAliquot 50 µL droplets of primary antibody solution in a line, each spaced approximately 1 cm apart.\nPlace each coverslip on a droplet.\nIncubate for 40 min at room temperature, protected from light.\nAfter the incubation period, wash twice with 1x PBS.\nDilute the secondary antibody, phalloidin, and Hoechst dye in 4% BSA in 1x PBS.",
    "Aliquot 50 µL droplets of the mix, each spaced approximately 1 cm below the first line of coverslips, as done previously.\nPlace each coverslip on a droplet.\nIncubate for 30 min at room temperature, protected from light.\nAfter incubation, wash twice with 1x PBS.\nWash once with distilled water to remove the salts.\nMount the coverslips on a glass slide with polymerizing mounting medium.\nLet the coverslips dry overnight at room temperature, protected from light, before microscopy.\n4. Quantifications\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54911/54911fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Linear invadosome quantification. The macro requires confocal images of F-actin and Tks5 staining (format: 1,024 x 1,024). (A) First, open the F-actin picture and make a mask. (B) Then, open the Tks5 picture and threshold it. Apply the macro. (C) Analyzed results will appear in two tables. The number of linear invadosomes per cell and other information, such as the percentage area used by linear invadosomes in the cell, will be in the Summary table.

Quantify at least 300 cells per n, with n = 3.\nCalculate the percentage of cells forming linear invadosomes by taking the average of three independent experiments, resulting in 900 quantified cells.\nLinear invadosome size and number per cell\n\tNOTE: Use a confocal microscope to take sequential images of the F-actin and Tks5 stains. The macro is adapted to a 1,024 x 1,024 image format.\n\t\nUse ImageJ with the supplementary macro.\nDegradation per cell\nUse three coverslips per condition.\nTake 30 images per coverslip of fluorescent gelatin and Hoechst-stained nuclei.",
    "Use the ImageJ software as described in Martin KH et al.9.\n5. 3D Collagen Invasion Assay\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54911/54911fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Invasion assay schema. Summary of the invasion assay protocol. Collagen I is cross-linked with succinimidyl ester dye and polymerized for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells are added in serum-free medium on top of the collagen I plug. The insert is placed in medium with 10% FBS. Collagen I plugs are fixed 1 h after cell seeding in the control and 3 days after cell seeding in the experimental condition to determine the invasion capacity of the cells. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=http://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54911/54911fig3large.jpg]\nCollagen I plug preparation\nMake a time course of 4 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h for the first experiment to determine the kinetics of invasion into the gel according to the cell type. For each experiment, add a 1 h time point as a reference time point when no invasion occurs.\nPrepare the collagen I solution on ice under a sterile laminar flow hood. Prepare 500 µL of solution for 3 Boyden chamber inserts.\nAspirate 1 mg of commercial rat-tail collagen I to prepare a solution with a final concentration of 2 mg/mL collagen I.\nAdd 5-carboxy x Rhodamine succinimidyl ester at a final concentration of 1 µg/mL, calculated for the final volume of collagen I solution (in this case, 500 µL).\nMix well and incubate for 5 min on ice under the sterile laminar flow hood, protected from light.\nAdd 50 µL of ice-cold, filtered 10X PBS and 6.25 µL of ice-cold 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH).\nAdd sterile water according to the formula 443.75 - x µL of collagen I.\nAdd 100 µL of solution per Boyden chamber insert.",
    "Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C to allow for polymerization.\nAdd cell culture medium enriched with fetal bovine serum (FBS) into new wells; place inserts into these wells.\nSeed 30,000 cells on top of the collagen I plug in FBS-free medium.\nAfter culturing the cells at 37 °C, fix the collagen I plug for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1x PBS.\nComplete immunofluorescence as in step 3, with the exception of the following steps: permeabilize with 0.2% Triton X-100 in 1x PBS for 30 min, not 10 min; incubate with primary and secondary antibody solutions for 1.5 h each, rather than 40 min and 30 min, respectively. Stain for F-actin or nuclei to localize the cells.\nAfter immunofluorescence, use a scalpel to cut around the membrane of the insert and carefully transfer the collagen I plug to a glass-bottom dish. Make sure that the top of the collagen I plug is in contact with the glass. Keep the insert membrane attached to the bottom of the collagen I plug in order to maintain the integrity of the plug.\n\t\tNOTE: The collagen I plug remains intact in the glass-bottom dish. The depth between the glass bottom and the plastic surrounding the glass bottom is equivalent to the thickness of the plug.\nPlace a coverslip on the collagen I plug and mount with polymerizing mounting medium to prevent the plug from drying out.\nUse an inverted confocal microscope to image the collagen I plug; the top of the plug is in contact with the glass bottom of the dish.",
    "Acquire a z-stack from the top to the bottom of the collagen I plug to visualize cell invasion. Determine the thickness of the z-stack by examining how deeply the cells invade the imaging field. Perform acquisitions with a 40X oil objective in a 512 x 512 format with a z-step size of 0.25 μm.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For reference, the average z-stack for MDA-MB-231 cells 3 days after seeding is 30 µm.\nSubscription Required.
