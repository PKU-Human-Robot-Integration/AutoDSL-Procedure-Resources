    "1. Preparation of the Cells and Materials\nCultivate HEK293 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium with a 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% non-essential amino acids. Adjust the pH of the culture medium to 6.8 - 7.6.\nAfter culturing for 5 to 7 d, dissociate the cells with a 0.25% trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution (trypsin-EDTA) and reseed the cells at 5,000-10,000 cells/cm2.\n2. Seeding the Cells in an O-shaped Bag\nDissociate the cells as described in step 1.2 and resuspend them in 2 - 5 mL of culture medium.\nFilter the cell suspension through a cell strainer (40 µm) to collect a single cell suspension.\nCount the number of cells by trypan blue staining and automatic cell counter, and then prepare 20 mL of the cell suspension (2.0 x 105 cells/mL).\nConnect the inlet of the O-shaped bag (Figure 1a) to a clamped 50 mL syringe without a plunger.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57922/57922fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Schematic images and pictures of O-shaped vessels. (a1) This is a schematic image of an O-shaped bag. (a2) This is a picture of an O-shaped bag. (b1) This is a schematic image of an O-shaped dish. (b2) This is a picture of an O-shaped dish. The outer and inner diameter of the O-shaped bag are 90 mm and 20 mm, respectively.

Add 55 mL of clean air through the clean syringe to expand the bag completely.\nClamp the inlet tube and then close the inlet. Finally, remove the clamp from the tube.\nIncubate the cells in the O-shaped bag by shaking them at 45 rpm in conditions of 37 °C and 5% CO2.",
    "3. Medium Change (optional)\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 50 mL tube through the inlet.\nCentrifuge it for 2 min at 200 x g at room temperature, and then aspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 20 mL of culture medium and resuspend the cells.\nAdd the resuspended cells to the O-shaped bag by following steps 2.4 - 2.7.\nIncubate the cells in the O-shaped bag by shaking them at 45 rpm in conditions of 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n4. Collecting the Cells from the Bag\nTransfer the cell suspension into a 50 mL tube through the inlet.\nWash the inside of the bag with 20 mL of calcium/magnesium-free phosphate buffered saline [PBS(-), pH = 7.4 - 7.6] and then drain the contents into a tube to collect the remaining cells from the bag.\nCentrifuge the collected cell suspension for 3 min at 200 x g at room temperature, and then aspirate the supernatant.\nAdd 10 mL of PBS(-) and wash the aggregates.\nCentrifuge them for 3 min at 200 x g at room temperature, and then aspirate the supernatant to collect the aggregates.\nAdd 4 mL of PBS and 1 mL of trypsin and incubate them with the aggregates for 10 min at 37 °C to dissociate the cells for counting (optional).\n5. Preparation of an O-shaped Dish (optional)\nNOTE: See Figure 1b for a schematic image of the O-shaped dish.\nCut out the bottom of a 60 mm or 35 mm dish with a hot knife and utilize it as an inner dish.\nPut the 60 mm dish upside-down on the center of a 100 mm dish.\n\tNOTE: A guide sheet can help to decide the position of the 60 mm dish.\nIf required, put viscosity-adjusted cyclohexanone on the commissure from the inside of 60 mm dish.",
    "Dry the O-shaped dish for a few days and sterilize it by gamma ray or ethylene oxide gas."
