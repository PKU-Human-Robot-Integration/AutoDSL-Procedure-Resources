Here, a clear color of super bond is used, but the color is not important.\nTo relieve pain during scalp incision, inject lidocaine (∼10 μL) into the scalp. Inject dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg) subcutaneously to the back to relieve cerebral edema and prevent inflammation.",
    "Apply a drop of solcorin ophthalmic gel to the eyes to prevent dryness.\nRemove scalp hair neatly to prevent contamination.\nTo remove the hair cleanly, apply a drop of instant adhesive (Loctite 401, Henkel) on the hair of the mouse and spread it thinly in the direction of the hair growth (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B, white arrows). Wait a few minutes for the product to dry (lightly dab with a wet cotton swab doused with alcohol to aid faster drying).\nPull the glued hair in the direction opposite to hair growth (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B; opposite to white arrows) with forceps, holding the back of the neck with the other hand (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B; an orange arrow) and use a forceps to maintain the head fixation.\nApply an antiseptic Povidone to the scalp for skin disinfection.\nTo remove the scalp, lift it slightly with forceps and cut with one snip with scissors. This creates a large oval-shaped removal of the scalp (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nCritical: To reduce EPI image distortion, the skull surface should be made as smooth and as flat as possible. Keep large incision results in EPI images with less distortion than commonly used for suturing a small incision.\nClean the skull with a blade and cotton swabs (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D) and mark the coordinates for implanting the optic cannula and/or virus injection (e.g., primary somatosensory forelimb area [S1FL]; AP: 0.0, ML: 2.2) (a white arrow on Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nUsing a dental drill, perform craniotomy (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F and 3I) and create a hole small enough for the fiber to pass (> 105 μm in our case).\nNote: Because the hole can cause an EPI image distortion, ensure the size of the hole is as small as possible and strive to prevent damage to the brain during craniotomy.\nTroubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: What if damage occurs?",
    "Using the manipulator, position the cannula at the desired coordinates (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]J).\nNote: If a virus injection is needed, inject the virus first before implanting the cannula. In our lab, we made a glass capillary (Glass capillaries for Nanoliter #504949, WPI or Borosilicate glass with filament #BF120-60-10, Sutter instruments) with a tip width of 20–30 μm using Puller (Micropipette puller #P-100, Sutter instruments) and connected it to the end of the injector (Nanoliter 2010, WPI) or tube to an infusion pump. Slowly, insert a virus-filled grass capillary into the brain and inject the virus for viral infection. After virus injection, the optic cannula may be implanted at identical coordinates. The position of the optic cannula can be checked with anatomical MRI scanning; it is highly recommended to perform a short MRI scan before an fMRI experiment.\nBefore fixing the cannula, apply some silicone sealant (Kwik-Cast, WPI) to the area of the brain where the optic cannula is implanted (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]K).\nCritical: Applying the ‘Kwik-Cast’ is very important to protect the exposed brain and to reduce EPI image distortion (minimizing air pockets around the fiber cannula). However, use only a small amount (ex. A drop), since this may hinder firm cannula fixation.\nFor bonding the optic cannula to the skull (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G and 3L),\nMix an adhesion promoter and polymerization initiator in the self-curing dental adhesive kit (Super Bond, C&B).\nApply the Super-Bond to the optic cannula to the skull and a thin layer of cement over the entire exposed skull, not just near the optic cannula.\nRepeat 2–3 times.",
    "Note: The product must be applied evenly and lightly (a minimum 4-mm cannula clear length is needed for tightly connecting the cannula to the L-shaped connector with a sleeve; gray dashed line of Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]L). Ensure that the cannula is firmly fixed. If the cement is applied too thick, it may be difficult to connect the fiber connector. If the cement is not applied evenly, image distortion is likely to occur. The cement needs to be applied at the edge of the exposed skull and nearby scalp (orange arrows in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H) for the reduction of inflammation caused by mouse touching.\nCritical: Be careful not to induce air bubbles when applying cement.\nWhen the cement is sufficiently hardened, loosen the cannula holder and lift it (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).\nTurn off isoflurane and inject meloxicam (5 mg/kg) subcutaneously to relieve pain and prevent inflammation.\nAllow the mouse to recover from anesthesia in the recovery chamber or heating pad. Then, return the mouse to the cage. For an acute experiment, move the mouse to the cradle.\nNote: To reduce the effect of the immune response, it is recommended to conduct an fMRI scan within 2–3 days or at least 2 weeks after surgery.20[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20] However, if you inject the virus into the brain for an optogenetic fMRI experiment, you must wait at least 4 weeks for the virus to expression.\nAnesthesia – Ket/Xyl or Dex/Iso\nTiming: total 3–6 h\nThis section describes how to properly anesthetize animals to perform opto-fMRI.\nNote: During fMRI experiments, maintain a light anesthesia level with the aid of physiological monitoring. Either Ket/Xyl or Dex/Iso can be used for fMRI studies; in our lab, Ket/Xyl is used for circuit mapping,1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],2[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2],3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3],21[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21] while Dex/Iso is used for network changes by behavioral modifications.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9],19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19],22[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]",
    "Before starting fMRI experiments, turn on all equipment (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), including the water heating system, which requires at least 15 min to heat the water sufficiently.\nAnesthetize the mouse with isoflurane in the induction chamber (4%–5% isoflurane in air and oxygen mixed gas for ∼2 min; the time may vary depending on the size of the induction chamber). Then, follow steps ‘a’ or ‘b’ depending on the type of anesthesia (see ‘anesthetic preparation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]’).\nKet/Xyl anesthesia – Intraperitoneally inject the mouse with Ket/Xyl induction solution at a dose of 2.435 μL/g body weight (60 μL/25 g, mixture 1) (ketamine 100 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg). Turn on the stopwatch immediately after the injection to determine the timing of any supplementary anesthetic dose.\nKeep the mouse in the heating system while the anesthetic takes effect (∼5 min).\nNote: Under anesthesia, autonomous body temperature control does not function properly, so it is necessary to use the heating system from this stage onward (even in the induction chamber).\nInsert a needle connected to a syringe containing the Ket/Xyl maintenance solution (mixture 3) into the mouse abdomen for repeated injections (see ‘anesthetic preparation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]’). Check the negative pressure by pulling the plunger back and ensure that there is no blood or urine coming out.\nNote: Since the needle can easily fall out in the process of moving the mouse into the magnet, it is recommended to apply a drop of ‘vetbond’ to the needle insertion area and tape the needle with a surgical ‘3M tape’ to fix it (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).",
    "Inject Ket/Xyl maintenance solution at a dose of 1.552 μL/g body weight (40 μL/26 g, mixture 3; ketamine 35 mg/kg and xylazine 1.75 mg/kg) whenever the animals show signs of arousal. In general, the first injection is performed 1 h after the induction of Ket/Xyl, and the subsequent injection is performed every ∼40 min.\nCritical: The timing of additional bolus injection was determined by changes in physiological signals. When the animal wakes up, the heart rate increases by more than 30 bpm, and the motion-sensitive respiratory wave and CO2 pressure of mouse expiration become irregular.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nAlternatives: Instead of intermittent injections, a continuous infusion can be used. For continuous intravenous infusion, insert a needle connected to a syringe containing heparinized saline (5–7 IU/mL) (later replace with the Ket/Xyl mixture 3 before insertion into the magnet) into the mouse tail vein. After 30 min post-induction bolus, infuse Ket/Xyl mixture3 at a rate of 2 μL/g/h (ketamine 45 mg/kg/h and xylazine 2.25 mg/kg/h).9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nDex/Iso anesthesia – Following step 18, isoflurane anesthesia (2%) is maintained. Then, insert a needle connected to a syringe containing heparinized saline into the mouse tail vein. Until entering the MR room, the mouse is maintained under anesthesia only with isoflurane.\nCritical: The longer the time of isoflurane anesthesia, the more reduced functional hemodynamic responses; thus, preparation time should be minimized.16[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16],23[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23]\n(Continue the process described in ‘positioning and monitoring – inside MR room[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.4]’ [step 25]). During the preparation in the MR bore, replace the heparinized saline syringe with the dexmedetomidine solution (see ‘anesthetic preparation[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]’).\nInject a bolus of 1 μL/g dexmedetomidine solution followed by the discontinuation of isoflurane.",
    "Ten minutes after IV bolus induction, infuse a dexmedetomidine mixture intravenously at a rate of 1 μL/g/h (0.05 mg/kg/h).9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] Isoflurane is used again at ∼0.3% from 30 min after the IV bolus of dexmedetomidine.\nNote: If the animal shows signs of waking from anesthesia, infuse 5 μL of dexmedetomidine mixture at a rate of 1 mL/h instead of increasing the concentration of isoflurane, and immediately restart continuous infusion. A short increase in isoflurane concentration may negatively impact an fMRI response.\nPositioning and monitoring – Outside MR room\nTiming: 20–30 min\nThis section describes how to prepare animals outside of the MR room to keep them stable.\nNote: All processes can be performed in the MR room, however, it is recommended to carry out basic preparations outside the MR room first to ensure easier maintenance of the body temperature. Configure a setup similar to the MR system, comprising an anesthesia system, a monitoring system, a heating system, and a gas supply unit (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nFix the mouse to the cradle using bite bar and ear bars. Check the monitoring system to see if the mouse breathes properly.\nInsert a pair of needle electrodes in the forepaw between digits 2 and 4 for electrical stimulation.\nNote: Be careful not to bleed. Since the needle can easily detach from the digits, tape it with 3M masking tape.\nNote: When the opto-fMRI response does not come out properly, sensory-evoked fMRI scanning may be needed for evaluating the animal’s condition. Herein, forepaw stimulation was used as an example, however, whisker, odor, or visual stimulation can be used as a reference.\nUsing a blade, remove the residue from the optic cannula and wipe the tip of the cannula with a cotton swab sprayed with optic cleaning fluid (FCS3, Thorlabs, Sticklers) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B, blue arrow).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2251-Fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4. Preparation for optogenetic fMRI\n(A) Preparation outside the MR room. a. Clean the tip of the optic cannula (blue arrow) with optic cleaning fluid. Usually, the edge at the cement (orange arrows) has air pockets. b. Apply ‘Kwik-Cast’ over the exposed skull of the mouse’s head, including the crevices.\n(B) Preparation inside the MR room. After mounting the surface coil, connect the optic patch cord to the optic cannula. Wrap around ‘Kwik-cast’ with ‘Blu-Tack’ to block light leakage.\n(C) Differences in MR images with and without ‘Kwik-Cast’. When ‘Kwik-Cast’ was applied, distortion was reduced in both the conventional FLASH image and EPI image (red arrows). A white arrow indicates the position where the optic cannula is inserted. FLASH; fast low angle shot, GE-EPI; gradient-echo echo-planar imaging.\nNote: It is recommended to mark in advance where the sleeve should be inserted into the optic cannula (e.g., 4 mm) for connecting the L-shaped connector and an optic patch cord. Since excessive loss of light generally occurs at the connection part, it is important to connect tightly, leaving no gaps.\nApply silicone sealant ‘Kwik-Cast’ to every corner and the mouse’s exposed skull (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A).\nCritical: This work significantly reduces image distortion (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]C, red arrows). Apply it thoroughly between crevices, such as near the eyes and under the edge of the resin cement (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A, orange arrows). Be careful not to apply too thick, as it may be difficult to place the RF coil (surface coil) close to the brain.\nApply Forus eye ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness and visual response.",
    "Note: Opaque eye ointment (any) reduces unnecessary light stimulation that enters the eye during optogenetic stimulation. However, when conducting visual stimulation experiments together, use only transparent eye drops (e.g., solcorin) for eye protection. The light leaking from the optic fiber should be blocked as much as possible with ‘Blu-Tack’.\nIf the preparation is carried out outside the MR room, then, disconnect all tubes in the cradle from the ventilator, monitoring equipment, and heating equipment, and move the cradle with the mouse to the MR room.\nPositioning and monitoring – Inside MR room\nTiming: 20 min\nThis section describes how to setup the animals for opto-fMRI experiments within the MR room.\nNote: Mouse brain should be placed in the iso-center of the magnet to obtain consistent and minimally distorted MRI scans. After the mouse enters the bore, the state of the mouse should be monitored.\nAfter connecting the mouse cradle (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A–1C) to the body part of the cradle with screws (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D), immediately connect all lines and sensors (heart rate, breathing, temperature).\nNote: When the temperature probe is inserted into the rectum, use the lidocaine jelly to relieve pain.\nNote: Since the depth of anesthesia is judged through heart rate, respiration waveform, and EtCO2 values, ensure these signals are observable.\nFor effective heating, secure a heating pad over the body of the mouse (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nNote: In the cold environment of the MR room, it is difficult to maintain normal body temperature only with the heating tube under the mouse body (see ‘Heating system setup’).\nKeep checking the vital sign values displayed on the monitoring screen (small animal monitoring, SA instruments).\nConnect the stimulator for forepaw evoked-fMRI experiments.",
    "Position the RF coil to the mouse head. When using a surface coil, place it exactly at the target position using reusable putty-like adhesive, ‘Blu-Tack’, and a 3M masking tape to avoid movement (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nConnect the L-shaped optic connector and fiber patch cord to the optic cannula implant with the assistance of black-colored sleeves until there is no gap between the fibers (see marking in the optic cannula, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A b).\nTurn on the laser to ensure the light is transmitted properly and turn it off.\nCover the light leaking out of the optical fiber with an adhesive ‘Blu-Tack’’ to prevent unnecessary visual stimuli (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nPush the cradle into the magnet bore until the mouse brain is positioned at the ‘isocenter’ of the magnet. The use of an accurate positioning device (laser marking) is preferable.\nImaging – BOLD fMRI\nTiming: 2–5 h\nThis section describes how to obtain opto-fMRI images.\nNote: For a successful mouse optogenetic fMRI experiment, high-quality EPI images and stable animal conditions are required. Adjustments to the mouse position and shimming should be performed, as required. Concurrently, mouse physiological status should be maintained with the assistance of monitoring equipment.\nPerform tuning and matching of the RF coil.\nTo optimize the efficiency of signal sensitivity, while checking the spectrometer (Bruker), adjust the tuning capacitor of the RF coil to horizontally shift the dip of the wobble curve to the center frequency of the MR system.\nAdjust the matching capacitor to vertically shift the dip in the wobble curve to minimize the reflected power.\nRun the MRI preparation scans. We generally run a standard localizer or multi-slice localizer to ensure the mouse brain is at the isocenter.",
    "Note: To increase the reproducibility of the experiment, it is necessary to always position the mouse brain in the same position. If you adjust the position, check the coil tuning and matching.\nCritical: The isocenter is the most homogeneous magnetic field inside the MR magnet, and shimming is easy if the mouse head is positioned at the isocenter. The consistent positioning reduces inter-subject variations and increases the reproducibility of high-quality EPI images.\nIn MR software, determine EPI slice positions with reference to the multi-slice localizer image. Then, obtain EPI images.\nNote: If the EPI image is highly distorted or the signal is low, consider re-shimming or adjusting the surface coil position.\nTroubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: What if the image quality is poor?\nStart the GE-EPI sequence for functional imaging (in our case, we used TE/TR = 11.5/1,000 ms).\nKeep monitoring the animal’s vital signs during functional imaging and carefully maintain the animal under consistent anesthesia.\nNote: If you use the Ket/Xyl bolus injection protocol, it is recommended not to acquire functional data within about 6 min after each injection.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]\nNote: Usually, in anesthetized mice, the fMRI signal tends to be weak within 1 h after the initial anesthetic injection.10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] At the beginning of the scan, it is recommended to obtain anatomy images first. The induction of detectable responses in the primary somatosensory cortex via forepaw stimulation is an indication that the anesthetized animal’s condition is suitable for opto-fMRI experiments.\nTroubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]: What if there is no functional response?\nAfter finishing the experiment, remove the cradle bed section from the MR system (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nBefore returning the mouse to the cage, ensure that the mouse is safely recovering from anesthesia. Use any heating equipment to maintain body temperature until the mouse is conscious.",
    "Note: The effects of dexmedetomidine can be quickly reversed by using Antisedan (atipamezole hydrochloride), a synthetic α2-adrenoreceptor antagonist. After finishing the experiment, use the Antisedan, if needed.\nNote: In our case, we set up a heated recovery chamber (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). If more than 5 h are required for the experiment, we recommend that the mouse should be retained in the heated recovery chamber overnight, and subsequently returned to the cage.\nNote: The silicone sealant (Kwik-Cast, WPI) applied to the head does not need to be removed for the use of the next experiment.\nCritical: Maintain the heating temperature within a standard range. Overheating increases the risk of animal mortality.\nPause point: When performing a longitudinal study, a minimum of 1 week of recovery is required after the fMRI experiment."
