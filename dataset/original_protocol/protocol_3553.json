    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThe modified ATAC protocol has the following main steps:\nCells extraction from tissue\nTiming: 1.5 h\nStep 1 enables the extraction of cells from tissues by shearing tissue and creating a cells suspension.\nFlash-freeze 7 last instar female Daphnia juveniles in 2 mL VWR Screw Cap tubes containing 25–30 ceramic beads of 1.4 mm diameter. Store at –80°C.\nPause Point: The frozen tissue can be stored at −80° before further processing.\nThaw samples on ice.\nAdd 300 μL MasterPure Tissue and Cell Lysis Solution with 2.8 μL of proteinase K (50 U/mL).\nShear samples using an automated tissue homogenizer (e.g., Geno/Grinder) at 1,750 rpm for 30 s.\nPlace tubes in 65°C for 15 min, inverting 3 times during the incubation.\nCool samples at 37°C for 5 min.\nAdd 4 μL of 1 mg/mL RNase A.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min.\nPlace on ice for 5 min.\nCritical: The amount of tissue used to obtain sufficient nuclei is determined experimentally. A titration experiment using different amounts of tissue is recommended for this optimization step. For the protocol optimization, we used pools of last instar Daphnia juveniles ranging from 7 to 60 individuals. Please refer to the Expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes] section below for a description of results of the titration experiment.\nNuclei purification\nTiming: 0.5 h\nStep 10 enables the separation of cell material and proteins from the nuclei\nAdd 175 μL MPC protein precipitation reagent (MasterPure Kit) and mix well by gentle pipetting\nCentrifuge at 10,000 × g for 10 min in a refrigerated centrifuge at 4°C",
    "Note: If chromatin deconvolution is not efficient following the steps above, a pico-sonication step for DNA shearing (e.g., Bioruptor, Covaris) can be introduced. For the optimization of this protocol, two settings were used on the Bioraptor: 600 bp and 150 bp. No appreciable differences were observed in the DNA libraries and in the sequencing results between these two settings (see Expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]).\nTransfer supernatant to a clean tube and store at –20°C\nPause Point: The purified nuclei can be stored at −20° until further processing.\nThaw samples on ice and transfer 1/3 of supernatant into tubes containing 1 mL of resuspension buffer (RSB; MasterPure Kit) and 0.1% Tween 20.\nNote: All supernatant can be transferred into the resuspension buffer. It is possible to determine whether the whole resuspension is needed by testing DNA library quality when a proportion of the supernatant is used. Using only a fraction of the supernatant may provide sufficient material for technical replicates. .\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min in a fixed-angle pre-chilled 4°C centrifuge to pellet the nuclei.\nDiscard Supernatant.\nPause Point: The pelleted nuclei can be stored at −20° until further processing.\nTransposition reaction optimization\nTiming: 1.5 h\nThis step is only used in the optimization stage to reduce the amount of transposase enzyme without affecting data quality. A titration of the manufacturer recommended transposase enzyme concentration were used to identify the minimum amount required for a high-quality ATAC library. The results of this titration experiment are in Expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes].\nImmediately following the nuclei preparation, resuspend the pellet in different dilutions of the transposase reaction mix [25 μL 2× TD buffer; 0.63 μL transposase (100 nM final concentration); 22.5 μL of nuclease-free water].\nTest different transposase concentrations. Here we tested four concentrations of the transposase enzyme as follows:",
    "1/1 of the volume recommended: 25 μL 2× TD Buffer; 2.5 μL transposase; 22.5 μL of nuclease-free water.\n1/2 of the volume recommended: 25 μL 2× TD Buffer; 1.25 μL transposase; 23.75 μL of nuclease-free water.\n1/4 of the volume recommended: 25 μL 2× TD Buffer; 0.63 μL transposase; 24.37 μL of nuclease-free water.\n1/8 of the volume recommended: 25 μL 2× TD Buffer; 0.32 μL transposase; 24.68 μL of nuclease-free water.\nIncubate the transposition reaction at 37°C for 30 min in a thermomixer using 1,000 rpm mixing speed\nNote: Longer incubation times may be tested to improve the transposition efficiency. In the optimization phase, incubation of 16–20 h was tested. The Tapestation traces did not show significant difference between the two incubation times (see Expected outcomes[href=https://www.wicell.org#expected-outcomes]).\nStore samples at −20°C until further processing\nPause Point: The transposition reaction can be stored overnight or up to few days at −20° before progressing with the purification step.\nPurify samples using a 1:1 volume Magbio HighPrep PCR beads (Auto Q Biosciences) as follows:\nPlace Magbio HighPrep PCR beads at 18°C–20°C for 30 min\nAdd nuclease-free water to the ligation reaction bringing the reaction volume to 100 μL.\nCritical: Ensure that the final volume is 100 μL before adding Magbio HighPrep PCR beads.\nAdd 100 μL (1.0×) of resuspended Magbio HighPrep PCR beads and mix well using a vortex mixer or a pipette (pipet gently at least 10 times).\nIncubate for 5 min at 18°C–20°C.\nSpin tubes in a microcentrifuge and place on a magnetic rack to separate beads from the supernatant. After the solution clears (about 5 min), discard the supernatant that contains unwanted fragments.\nCritical: Do not discard the beads, which bind to the target fragments.",

    "An optimization of the PCR cycling of transposed DNA is advised as suboptimal amplification or overamplification can introduce biases in the DNA fragments distribution within the libraries. For example, in case of over amplification small DNA fragments are preferentially amplified. Consequently, the DNA libraries suffer from reduced complexity.\nComplete 5 PCR cycles following the cycling conditions below and using NEBNext High-Fidelity PCR master mix and 25 μM Nextera PCR primers: 25 μL NEBNext High-Fidelity 2× PCR Master Mix; 10 μL transposed DNA; 2.5 μL (25 μM) Forward Primer (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]); 2.5 μL (25 μM) Reverse Primer; 10 μL nuclease-free H2O.\nOptimization step 1: PCR cycling\n1 cycle\n30 s, 98°C\n5 cycles\n10 s, 98°C\n30 s, 63°C\n60 s, 72°C\nHold at 4°C until optimization step 2 is complete.\nOptimization step 2: qPCR to determine the optimal number of PCR cycles Perform a qPCR (5 μL NEBNext High-Fidelity 2× PCR Master Mix; 5 μL of amplified DNA from optimization step 1; 0.25 μL (25 μM) Nextera Forward PCR Primer; 0.25 μL (25 μM) Nextera Reverse PCR Primer; 0.09 μL 100 x SYBR Green I; 4.41 μL nuclease-free H2O) with the following cycling program:\n1 cycle\n30 s, 98°C\n20 cycles\n10 s, 98°C\n30 s, 63°C\n60 s, 72°C\nCalculate the total number of PCR cycles and compete step 25.

Use the average library size from the Tapestation QC test to determine the final molar concentration. Other quantitation approaches can be used (e.g., qPCR). Here, we used Qubit combined with Tapestation traces because it allows a higher throughput and is more cost-effective. Information from the Tapestation traces allow to assess the fragment distribution within libraries. A bioanalyzer can be used in alternative to the Tapestation.\nNote: The Tapestation traces appear smooth with a peak at 200–400 bp, depending on the insert size used in the library preparation (see below). The same libraries run on a bioanalyzer tend to show a more laddered profile (data not shown). The profile can vary among samples with some samples showing a wider peak; however, these difference do not affect the quality of the libraries.\nPrepare equimolar pools of ATAC libraries ensuring that different sets of unique paired indexes are used for different libraries.\nAssess the quality and size of the ATAC library pool on Tapestation 2200 (Agilent, G2964AA) using High Sensitivity D1000 Screentape (Agilent - 5067- 5584) and High Sensitivity D1000 Reagents (Agilent - 5067- 5585).\nQuantitate ATAC library pool using Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Q33216) and Qubit 1× dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen, Q33231).\nOptional step.
