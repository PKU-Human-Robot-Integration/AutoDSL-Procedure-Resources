    "1. Preparation of Cytosolic and Nuclear Protein Fraction\nPlate 4 x 106 ACC-MESO-4 cells in a T150 cell culture flask grown in RPMI - 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1x penicillin/streptomycin (100x), and 2 mM L-Glutamine (200 mM). When cells reach a confluence of 80-90% (~5-5.5 x 106 cells), proceed with protein extraction of nuclear and cytosolic fraction.\n\tNOTE: ACC-MESO-4 cell line was obtained from the RIKEN BioResource Centre11.\nAspirate medium, wash the cells by adding 15 mL of 1x PBS, tilt the plate gently a few times and aspirate the 1x PBS. Add 3 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA and incubate the culture flask at 37 °C for 3 min.\n\tNOTE: Look at the cells under the microscope for detachment; if still attached tap the flask against the palm of a hand 3 times.\nAdd 7 mL of RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 1x penicillin/streptomycin (100x), and 2 mM L-Glutamine (200 mM), collect the cells in a 15 mL tube, and spin down at 200 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate medium and resuspend cell pellet with 1.5 mL of 1x PBS, then transfer the cells into a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Spin down at 500 x g and 4 °C for 5 min. Discard the supernatant.\n\tNOTE: From this step onwards, perform all centrifugation steps at 4 °C and keep all reagents on ice.\nResuspend the cell pellet with ice-cold 1.5 mL of 1x PBS and spin down the cells at 500 x g and 4 °C for 3 min. Discard the supernatant.",
    "NOTE: The required amounts of CER I, CER II, and NER reagents are 10, 0.55, and 5 volumes of estimated cell pellet packed volume, respectively; the following protocol assumes a volume of 20 µL. We recommend preparing only the required amount of reagent CER I.\nAdd 200 µL of ice-cold cytoplasmic extraction reagent (CER I) supplemented with 2 µL of 1x proteinase inhibitor, e.g., dilute 1 tablet of Protease Inhibitor (EDTA-free) in 500 µL of water to obtain 100x stock. This amount of reagent CER I is enough to lyse 20 µL of a cell pellet packed volume.\n\t\nTo estimate the cell pellet packed volume, compare the tube containing the cell pellet with a 1.5 mL tube filled with 10, 20, 50 or 100 µL of 1x PBS.\nResuspend the cell pellet by vigorously vortexing the tube for 15 s and incubate the tube on ice for 10 min. Add 11 µL of ice-cold cytoplasmic extraction reagent II (CER II) to the tube, vigorously vortex for 5 s, and incubate 1 min on ice.\nVortex vigorously for 5 s and centrifuge the tube at 16,000 x g and 4 °C for 5 min. Transfer the supernatant to the clean pre-chilled tube on ice. The supernatant is the cytoplasmic fraction that is further used in the RNA-pulldown experiment.\nResuspend the remaining pellet in 100 µL of ice-cold nuclear extraction reagent (NER) supplemented with 1 µL of proteinase inhibitor (100x) and vigorously vortex for 15 s. We recommend preparing only the required amount of NER reagent supplemented with protease inhibitors.\nIncubate the sample on ice for 40 min with occasional vortexing for 15 s (every 10 min).\nCentrifuge the tube at 16,000 x g for 10 min. Transfer the supernatant (this is the nuclear protein fraction) to a clean pre-chilled tube.",
    "Immediately proceed by measuring protein concentration using the bicinchoninic (BCA) method (see Table of Materials).To control for protein purity of each fraction, perform immunoblotting (Figure 1) against α-tubulin (positive detection only in the cytosolic fraction) and Poly ADP-ribose polymerase - PARP (positive detection only in the nuclear fraction). For protein visualization, refer to section 4.\nIn order to keep protein activity and their native state, prepare 25 µL of aliquots of cytosolic and nuclear extracts. Snap-freeze these aliquots by placing them in liquid nitrogen for 5 s and store directly at -80 °C.\n2. Labeling of RNA with Desthiobiotin\nHave RNA probes commercially synthesized and HPLC purified. Resuspend with nuclease-free water at 10 µM.\n\tNOTE: Probe sequences are listed in Table 1.\nUse 50 pmol of RNA per RNA-pulldown reaction. Thaw and keep all reagents on ice except for PEG 30%, used to label 3' terminus of RNA oligo.\nTransfer 5 µL of 10 µM RNA probes, labeled as CALB2 3' UTR (ARE), CALB2 3' UTR (mtARE), and Unrelated-RNA (IRE), into 0.5 mL thin-wall microcentrifuge tubes and incubate in a PCR machine at 85 °C for 5 min. Place the tubes immediately on ice.\n\tNOTE: This step is important, as it promotes the relaxation and accessibility of the RNA probe for labeling.\nFor a single 30 µL reaction, add to the RNA-containing tube the following 10 µL mix: 3 µL of nuclease free water, 3 µL of 10x RNA Ligase Reaction Buffer, 1 µL of RNase Inhibitor (40 U/µL), 1 µL of Desthiobiotinylated Cytidine Bisphosphate (1 mM), and 2 µL of T4 RNA ligase (20 U/µL).",
    "NOTE: To prepare master mix A for 3 samples in excess (3.2), mix 9.6 µL of nuclease free water, 9.6 µL of 10x RNA Ligase Reaction Buffer, 3.2 µL of RNase Inhibitor (40 U/µL), 3.2 µL of Desthiobiotinylated Cytidine Bisphosphate (1 mM), and 6.4 µL of T4 RNA ligase (20 U/µL).\nAdd carefully 15 µL of PEG 30% to the reaction. Use another tip to mix the reaction. Incubate the reaction overnight at 16 °C.\nThe next day, prepare the following: 5 M NaCl (fresh/nuclease-free), chloroform: isoamyl alcohol in 24:1 ratio (e.g., per reaction - 96 µL chloroform and 4 µL of isoamyl alcohol), ice-cold 100% ethanol, and ice-cold 70% ethanol.\nAdd 70 µL of nuclease-free water to the RNA-labeling reaction tubes. Add 100 µL of chloroform: isoamyl alcohol and vortex briefly. Spin-down at 13,000 x g for 3 min. Carefully remove ONLY the upper phase and transfer to a new nuclease-free 1.5 mL tube; avoid touching the lower phase.\nAdd 10 µL of 5 M NaCl, 1 µL of glycogen and 300 µL of ice-cold 100% ethanol. Place the tube at -20 °C for 2 h.\n\tNOTE: At this step, the experiment can be continued on the following day.\nCentrifuge at 13,000 x g and 4 °C for 15 min. Carefully discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet. Add 300 µL of ice-cold 70% ethanol and centrifuge again at 13,000 x g and 4 °C for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant completely and air-dry the pellet (15 min). Resuspend the pellet in 20 µL of nuclease-free water.\n\tNOTE: Proceed with RNA-pulldown on the same day.\nIncubate the RNA at 90 °C for 2 min and place on ice. Place the labelled-RNA on ice during the following step of pre-washing of the streptavidin magnetic beads.",
    "NOTE: A longer incubation time may damage the RNA probe.\n3. RNA-Protein Pulldown\nPre-washing streptavidin-magnetic beads and incubation with desthiobiotin-RNA\nUse 50 µL of streptavidin magnetic beads per 50 pmol RNA. However, this should be optimized depending on the experiment.\nVortex the tube with streptavidin-magnetic beads for 15 s, and quickly remove 200 µL (master mix; enough for 3+1 reactions) into a clean 1.5 mL safe-lock tube using cut pipette tips. Place the tube on a magnetic stand so that the beads collect at the side of the tube and wait 1 min. Remove the resuspension liquid.\nTo wash the beads, remove the tube from the magnetic stand, add 400 µL of 0.1 M NaOH, 0.05 M NaCl solution, and gently pipet up and down several times. Place the tube back on the magnetic stand. Wait 1 min and collect the supernatant. Repeat this step again.\nWash the beads with 200 µL of 100 mM NaCl. Remove the supernatant.\nAdd 200 µL of 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), resuspend beads by pipetting, place the tube on the magnetic stand, wait for 1 min and remove the supernatant. Repeat the step.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic stand, add 200 µL of 1x RNA Capture buffer, and resuspend streptavidin magnetic beads by briefly vortexing. Remove 50 µL of streptavidin magnetic beads and add to each labeled-RNA tube using a cut pipette tip. Incubate the tubes for 30 min at room temperature on a roller.\nBinding of protein to RNA\nPlace the tubes into a magnetic stand, wait 1 min, and remove the supernatant.\nAdd 50 µL of 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5) to the beads and resuspend by pipetting. Place the tubes into a magnetic stand, wait 1 min, and remove supernatant. Repeat this step.",
    "Add 100 µL of 1x Protein-RNA binding buffer to the beads and resuspend by pipetting.\nIn the meantime, prepare the following mix: 10 µL of 10x Protein-RNA binding buffer, 30 µL of 50% glycerol, 50 µg of cytoplasmic proteins, and nuclease-free water up to 100 µL.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare master mix B for 3 samples in excess (3.3) as follows: 33 µL of 10x Protein-RNA binding buffer, 99 µL of 50% glycerol, 165 µg of cytoplasmic proteins and nuclease-free water up to 330 µL. Keep the tube of master mix B on ice.\nPlace the tubes into magnetic stand, wait 1 min and collect the supernatant. Add 100 µL of master mix B, resuspend by gently pipetting up and down, and avoid creating bubbles. Incubate reaction tubes for 60 min at 4 °C on a roller.\nWashing and elution\nPlace the tubes into a magnetic stand, collect the supernatant (which is flow through - FT), and transfer into a new tube.\n\t\tNOTE: Keep this FT on ice for later analysis.\nPipette 100 µL of 1x Wash buffer on the beads, resuspend gently, put back into the magnetic stand, wait 1 min, and discard the supernatant. Repeat this step 2 times.\nAdd 40 µL of Elution Buffer to the magnetic beads, mix by pipetting up and down, and incubate at 37 °C on a tube shaker (950 rpm) for 30 min.\nPlace the tubes into a magnetic stand, wait 1 min, and collect eluted sample (which is eluate - E). Place on ice and use for downstream analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: At this step, each tested RNA probe consists of a flow-through (FT) and eluate (E) sample.\n4. Polyacrylamide Electrophoresis and Western Blot Analysis",
    "NOTE: See Table 2 for recipes for the buffers used in this section. Perform a Western blot according to the Laemmli method12.\nHandcast 12% SDS-PAGE gels (10-wells, 1.5 mm spacer, 66 µL). Prepare a running gel mix: 4 mL of 30% acrylamide-bisacrylamide stock solution, 2.4 mL of Lower Tris buffer, 3.2 mL of dH2O, 9.6 µL of TEMED, 96 µL of 10% ammonium persulfate solution (APS). Prepare stacking gel mix: 3.25 mL of dH2O, 0.5 mL of 30% acrylamide - bisacrylamide stock solution, 1.3 mL of Upper Tris buffer, 10 µL of TEMED, 20 µL of 10% APS.\nAdd 16.6 µL of 6x Laemmli buffer (e.g., 14 mL of Tris/HCl/SDS pH 6.8 (Upper Tris buffer), 2 g of SDS, 1.86 g of DTT, 6 mL of glycerol, and 0.012% bromophenol blue; stored at -20 °C) into the FT sample, and 6.6 µL of 6x Laemmli buffer into E sample. Incubate samples for 5 min at 95 °C.\nLoad the samples (20 µL of FT and whole Elute ~40 µL) and run them for 30 min at 60 V, continuing with 20 V overnight.\nUsing a semi-dry electroblotting system, transfer proteins onto a PVDF membrane for 80 min at 15 V.\n\tNOTE: The PVDF membrane must be activated before performing protein transfer. Incubate the membrane in 100% methanol for 1 min, followed by a 2 min incubation in ultrapure water.\nAfter the protein transfer, incubate the SDS-PAGE gel with Coomassie solution for 3 h, followed by three steps of washing with ultrapure water, each 30 min.\nAt the end of protein transfer, let the PVDF membrane dry for 1 h. Reactivate the membrane as indicated in step 4.5. Block the membrane 1 h with 5% BSA in 1x TTBS.",
    "Incubate the membrane with the first antibody: HuR or mesothelin, both diluted 1:1000 in 5% BSA in 1x TTBS for 4h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C.\nWash the membrane three times for 7 min in 1x TTBS, and incubate with rabbit anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody diluted 1:10,000 in 5% BSA, 1x TTBS.\nVisualize proteins using enhanced chemiluminescence and a digital imager.\nSubscription Required.
