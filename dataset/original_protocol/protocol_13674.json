    "Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180-270 g body weight) were purchased commercially (e.g., Envigo) and were housed under pathogen-free conditions at The Ohio State University Animal Facility. All procedures were humanely performed according to the NIH and the National Research Council's Guide for the Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and with the approval of The Ohio State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC Protocol # 2012A00000135-R2).\n1. Initial setup\nSet up surgical devices.\n\tNOTE: This is a non-survival surgery. If survival surgery is to be performed, sterile instruments and barrier precautions would need to be undertaken. \n\t\nTurn on the heart rate/oxygen saturation monitoring equipment and warming board to 42 °C.\nTurn on the ventilation and anesthesia machine to pre-warm the isoflurane evaporator.\n\t\tNOTE: Use a tidal volume (Td) of 7.2 mL/kg, a positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 2 cmH2O, and a respiratory rate of 80 bpm.\nFill the anesthesia syringe with 10 mL of liquid isoflurane and mount the syringe onto the ventilation and anesthesia machine.\nTurn on the surgical microscope with the height and focus adjusted to the microsurgeon's preferences.\nTurn on the electrocautery device.\nPrepare and lay out surgical tools (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: All surgical tools were autoclaved at 121 °C for 30 min.\nCollect and record body weight of donor and recipient rats.\nUse Table 1 and the rat's body weight to determine the correct gauge of angio-catheter (20, 18, 16 14, or 12 G) to use to make cuffs.\nPrepare cuffs for pulmonary artery (PA), bronchus (Br), and pulmonary vein (PV) using the size guide based on body weight (Table 1 and Figure 2).\n\t\nPlace angio-catheter sized 20 G, 18 G, 16 G, 14 G, or 12 G (Figure 2A-E) on a sterile surface under the surgical microscope.",
    "Then use a rib-back surgical blade #11 (Figure 2F) to cut the angio-catheter at a 90° angle to form a 2 mm in length cuff body with a 1 mm X 1 mm tab (width x height) at the top of the cuff body (Figure 2G).\nStore cuffs in sterile saline until ready to use.\nPrepare solutions.\n\t\nPrepare a mixture of ketamine and xylazine in a sterile injection vial by adding 1 mL of xylazine (100 mg/mL) to 10 mL ketamine (100 mg/mL).\n\t\tNOTE: The expiration date for this cocktail is determined using the earliest expiration date of the components used.\nDraw into syringes the proper dosage for the rats (0.1 mL of the ketamine/xylazine mixture per 100 g of rat's body weight; e.g., for a 200 g rat, 0.2 mL of ketamine/xylazine mixture would be delivered).\n\t\tNOTE: This dosage will deliver 91 mg/kg of ketamine and 9.1 mg/kg of xylazine to the rat and should keep a rat sedated for 60-80 min.\nPrepare heparin which will be delivered at a dose of 1,000 U/kg.\nStore the saline, PBS, and preservation solution on ice (Table of Materials).\n2. Donor rat preparation\nInduce anesthesia in the donor rat by intraperitoneally injecting the ketamine and xylazine mixture and waiting ~10 min for a surgical plane of anesthesia to develop that can be assessed by lack of response to toe-pinch.\nShave the incision area using electronic clippers.\nPlace the donor rat in a supine position on the surgical warming board and wipe the incision area with a sterile gauze soaked with betadine. Then wipe the area with a 70% isopropyl alcohol swab. Repeat 3 times.\nMake a 3 to 4 cm midline skin incision mid-neck using scissors and carefully dissect out subcutaneous tissues and muscles using forceps (instead of scissors to avoid bleeding).",
    "For endotracheal intubation, thread 4-0 silk suture around the trachea and insert a 16 G angio-catheter into the trachea. Tie the suture around the trachea tightly with a double knot, and then finish with a single knot to hold the angio-catheter in place.\nConnect the angio-catheter to the ventilator and maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia in the rat with 1-2% of isoflurane.\nPerform a laparo-sternotomy as a combined midline and transverse incision using scissors.\nInject heparin (1,000 U/kg) with an insulin syringe via the inferior vena cava (IVC) and allow 10 min for systemic circulation.\n\tNOTE: This administration of heparin prevents blood clots in the donor lung.\nDissect the diaphragm carefully by cutting along the thoracic arch, and then expose the thoracic cavity by following the sternum to the neck.\n3. Donor lung warm ischemia and procurement\nEuthanize the donor rat by cutting the IVC.\nWhile lungs are still ventilating, cut both right and left auricles with micro dissecting spring scissors and gravity flush lungs with 20 mL of preservation solution in a syringe hanging at 28 cmH2O by gravity connected to tubing and an 18 G angio-catheter that is introduced directly through the pulmonary artery.\nDisconnect the ventilator from the endotracheal tube and connect it to a 5 mL syringe filled with a proper volume of air based on body weight.\n\tNOTE: Volume of air to inflate lungs can be calculated as with twice of tidal volume (Td = 7.2 mL/kg), e.g., a 200 g rat would have a Td of 1.44 mL and multiplying it by 2 would equal 2.88 mL of air needed to inflate lungs.\nInflate donor's lungs.",
    "Put a Yasargil clamp on the trachea to keep lungs inflated, and cover the lungs and heart with sterile cotton gauze. Moisturize the gauze with saline, wrap the donor rat with an under pad, and leave on the warming surgery board for 1 h to induce warm ischemia in the lungs (Figure 3).\nAfter 1 h of warm ischemia, excise the heart-lung block with micro dissecting spring scissors and forceps and place on sterile gauze dampened with ice-cold PBS on a sterile Petri dish on ice.\n\tNOTE: All of the following steps should occur while lungs are on the Petri dish on ice.\nCarefully incise pulmonary ligaments with micro dissecting spring scissors to separate the left lung from the esophagus and the post-caval lobe.\nCarefully trim the left lung hilar area with Vannas-Tubingen spring scissor and procure the left PV, PA, and Br.\nPlace cuffs on PV, PA, or Br (Figure 4A-C).\n\t\nUse a mosquito hemostat to grab the cuff tab.\nUse fine forceps to grab the distal end of the PV, PA, or Br through the appropriate cuff body, evert the extra tissue around the cuff, and secure using 8-0 nylon suture. Use Vannas-Tubingen spring scissors to trim extra tissue and the cuff around the cuff body.\nKeep the donor lung covered with gauze dampened with saline on the Petri dish on ice until it is ready to be transplanted into the recipient rat (Figure 4D).\n\t​NOTE: Average cold ischemia time is 84 min ± 11 min S.D.\n4. Recipient rat preparation",
    "Induce anesthesia in the recipient rat in the same manner as the donor rat by intraperitoneally injecting the ketamine and xylazine mixture (0.1 mL per 100 g rat) and waiting 10 min for a surgical plane of anesthesia to develop that can be assessed by lack of response to toe-pinch.\nShave incision area using electronic clippers.\nPlace the donor rat in a supine position and wipe the incision area with a sterile gauze soaked with betadine. Then wipe the area with a 70% isopropyl alcohol swab. Repeat 3 times.\nBefore the rat is secured to the ventilation machine, draw lines on the rat's chest in preparation for finding the 4th intercostal space.\n\t\nMeasure the chest from the suprasternal notch to the xiphoid process and draw a line (Figure 5A).\nAt the middle of this line, draw a line along the left side of the chest that measures half of the measurement from the suprasternal notch to the xiphoid process (Figure 5A and B).\nIntubate the recipient using a 16 G angio-catheter via visualization using the fiber optic cable connected to an LED light from the endotracheal intubation kit.\nConnect the angio-catheter to the ventilator and maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia with 1-2% isoflurane.\nTo find the 4th intercostal space, find the area of the chest wall where a strong palpable cardiac impulse can be felt (Figure 5C, red circle).\nAt this location, incise the skin with scissors and the muscle with micro dissecting spring scissors, and use the retractor to open the 4th intercostal space as widely as possible (Figure 5D and E).\n\tNOTE: Use electrical cautery to avoid or stop bleeding during the muscle dissection.",
    "Once the intercostal space is opened widely, carefully dissect the ligaments around the recipient's left lung using Vannas-Tubingen spring scissors and pull the lung out of chest area using sterile cotton swabs and forceps.\nPlace sterile gauze around the left lung and hold it with a Dieffenbach bulldog clamp.\nApply a Yasargil clamp on the left lung hilar area as proximally as possible.\n5. Anastomoses\nPulmonary vein (PV) anastomosis\n\t\nPlace 7-0 nylon suture around the recipient's PV.\nIncise the recipient's PV using the Vannas-Tubingen spring scissors by transversely cutting the upper and lower segmental veins as distally as possible and flush out blood with 0.2 mL of heparinized saline (1 U/mL) using an insulin syringe.\nPlace the donor lung still wrapped with ice-cold wet sterile gauze into the thoracic cavity.\nInsert the donor's cuffed PV into the recipient's PV, and then secure with the prepositioned 7-0 nylon suture (Figure 6).\nBronchial (Br) anastomosis\n\t\nPlace 7-0 nylon suture around the recipient's Br.\nIncise the recipient's Br by cutting the upper and lower segmental airways transversely as distally as possible with Vannas-Tubingen spring scissors.\nInsert the donor's cuffed Br into recipient's Br and secure with the prepositioned 7-0 nylon suture (Figure 6).\nPulmonary artery (PA) anastomosis:\n\t\nPlace 7-0 nylon suture around the recipient's PA.\nIncise the recipient's PA from its adventitial sheath, incise half of the vessel's circumference with Vannas-Tubingen spring scissors, and then flush out blood in the PA with 0.2 mL heparinized saline (1 U/mL) using an insulin syringe.\nInsert the donor's cuffed PA into the recipient's PA and secure with the prepositioned 7-0 nylon suture (Figure 6).\n6. Reperfusion\nRemove the Yasargil clamp on the hilum to allow for reperfusion and ventilation of the transplanted donor lung (Figure 7).",
    "Dissect out the recipient's native left lung using micro dissecting spring scissors and forceps.\nCarefully reposition the transplanted left lung into the recipient's thorax.\nClose the thoracotomy incision by using 6-0 nylon suture.\n\t\nPlace three 6-0 nylon sutures with simple double knots around the ribs superior to the 4th rib and inferior to the 5th rib (Figure 8A).\nUse hemostats to gather the three sutures together (Figure 8B).\nIncrease the PEEP to 6 cmH2O in the ventilation settings.\nTie together all three knots at the same time by pulling away to close the wound (Figure 8C).\nDecrease PEEP to 2 cmH2O immediately.\nClose skin with 6-0 nylon suture.\n\t\t​NOTE: Our laboratory studies the acute phase post-transplantation, so the recipient rat in this model is survived for 3 h post-transplantation under ventilation and anesthesia and then samples are collected.\n7. Collection of experimental specimens (plasma, lung tissue)\nFor control samples, collect the donor's right lobes after the 3 h reperfusion period is initiated.\n\t\nSnap-freeze the superior lobe and post-caval lobe for protein or RNA expression analyses, preserve the middle lobe for histology, and use the inferior lobe for wet-to-dry weight ratio (Figure 9A).\nAt 10 min before the end of the 3h reperfusion time, prepare to harvest the recipient samples by injecting heparin (1,000 U/kg) with an insulin syringe into the jugular vein.\n\tNOTE: This administration of heparin prevents blood clots in the lungs and allows for a more thorough flushing at the time of procurement.\nPlasma collection\n\t\nAt the end of the 3 h reperfusion period, collect 1 mL of blood with a syringe via the IVC.\nStore on ice and then centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 10 min to harvest plasma.\nEuthanize the recipient rat by cutting the IVC to allow for exsanguination.",
    "Dissect the diaphragm along the thoracic arch and expose the thoracic cavity by dissecting out the rib cage.\nCollect BAL fluid from the native or transplanted lungs if desired (optional).\n\tNOTE: If wet-to-dry weight ratio or histology is being performed on the lung, BAL fluid collection should not be performed since it can affect results.\n\t\nThread 4-0 silk suture around trachea and tie a tight double knot around the trachea and intubation tube to prevent fluid leakage.\nCalculate the amount of ice-cold PBS for BAL fluid collection from the right lobes and left lobe.\n\t\tNOTE: The volume ratio for the right lung is 63% while the volume ratio for the left lung is 37%16. Therefore, to determine the amount of PBS to instill into each side, the volume should be calculated as twice the tidal volume (Td = 7.2 mL/kg) multiplied by 63% for the right lung and 37% for left lung.\nPlace a Yasargil clamp on the left lung hilar area (Figure 10A), and, with a syringe connected to the angio-catheter, instill the calculated amount of ice-cold PBS into the right lung (recipient's native lobes) and collect the BAL fluid by pulling up gently on the syringe plunger. Perform twice.\n\t\tNOTE: One should expect 70-80% recovery of instilled fluid.\nRemove the Yasargil clamp on the left lung and place the clamp on the right lung hilar area (Figure 10B).\nCollect BAL fluid from transplanted left lobe in the same way as it was collected for the right lobes, and then remove the clamp on right lung hilar area.\nCut the right and left auricles with micro dissecting spring scissors and flush lungs by gravity through the PA using an 18 G angio-catheter attached to tubing and a syringe with 20 mL of pre-chilled preservation solution hanging at 28 cmH2O.",
    "Collect samples from the recipient's lung.\n\t\nSnap-freeze the superior lobe and post-caval lobe for protein or RNA expression analyses, preserve the middle lobe for histology, and use the inferior lobe for wet-to-dry weight ratio) (Figure 9A).\nDivide the left transplanted left lobe into three parts: the upper region collected for snap-frozen, the middle region for histology, and the lower region for wet-to-dry weight ratio (Figure 9B).\nSubscription Required.
