    "1. SU-8 Master Fabrication (Figure 2)\nNOTE: Perform the fabrication of the SU-8 master molds in a clean room to prevent defects caused by dust particles. Two wafers are needed for the fabrication, one wafer with microfluidic features and one without.\nPrepare the master molds for the microfluidic chip. First apply an adhesion layer to the silicon wafer.\n\t\nDehydrate a silicon wafer for 10 min at 200 °C. Cool the wafer down to RT and load it on to a spin coater and spin coat it with SU-8 2002 with the following protocol.\nDispense about 3 ml resist onto the wafer.\nSpin the wafer at 500 rpm for 10 sec to spread the resist over the whole wafer.\nSpin the wafer at 2,000 rpm for 30 sec to achieve a resist height of approximately 2 µm.\nRemove excess resist from the edge of the wafer with an acetone soaked swab, to prevent sticking of the wafer to the hot plate in the next step. Bake the wafer for 60 sec at 95 °C on a hot plate.\nExpose the whole wafer with ultraviolet light (80 mJ/cm2 at 365 nm). Post-bake the wafer for 120 sec to 95 °C.\nCool the wafer down and immediately spin coat the wafer again using the following protocol for SU-8 2050:\n\t\nSpin the wafer at 100 rpm for 20 sec (dispense about 3 ml SU-8 resist during this step).\nSpin the wafer at 500 rpm for 10 sec to spread the resist over the whole wafer.\nSpin the wafer at 3,250 rpm for 30 sec resulting in a resist thickness of approximately 40 µm.",
    "Again, remove excess resist from the edge of the wafer with an acetone soaked swab and soft bake the wafer on a hot plate for 180 sec at 65 °C and for 360 sec at 95 °C.\nPrepare the photomask by sticking it to a soda-lime glass. See Figure 3 for the mask design. Use a mask aligner to expose the resist with ultraviolet light (160 mJ/cm2, measured at 365 nm) through the prepared mask. Bake the exposed wafer again on a hot plate for 60 sec at 65 °C and for 360 sec at 95 °C.\nAfter cooling down the wafer to RT, immerse it in a glass Petri dish filled with developer for 5 min to develop the resist. Gently agitate the petri dish to remove unexposed SU-8. Rinse the wafer with isopropanol and blow it dry with a nitrogen gun.\nExamine the wafer under a microscope. In case undeveloped resist remains on the features, develop the wafer again for a few minutes, as described in step 1.7.\nRemove any residual solvent by baking the wafers for 2 hr at 200 °C. Check the height of the features with a step profiler. In case the measured height differs from the desired height begin with this protocol again and adapt the spin speed in step 1.1.4.\nTo prevent sticking of the PDMS to the wafer silanize it by placing it in desiccator together with 50 µl of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane in a small porcelain dish. Reduce the pressure in the desiccator to 100 mbar and incubate the wafer for 12 hr.\n\t\nFor the blank PDMS parts silanize another silicon wafer using the method of step 1.10. To save time silanize both wafers at the same time in a single desiccator.\n2. LADE Chip Fabrication",
    "NOTE: The LADE chip is made out of two PDMS pieces that are bonded together by adhesive bonding24. The first part contains the microfluidic features. The other part is flat and used to seal the channels. Bonded together, they form the round shape necessary to interface the chip with the droplet transport system. Here, the fabrication of the two parts and their bonding is described. All process steps are shown in Figure 4.\nPrepare 44 g of PDMS by mixing 40 g of prepolymer with 4 g of the PDMS curing agent (this will result in up to 6 chips). Degas the PDMS in a desiccator until it is bubble free (this will take about 20 min).\nReplica molding of the structured halves.\n\t\nPlace the casting form on top of the wafer and snap it into place using the guiding structures around the design (see Figure 5). Skip the snapping into place for the flat PDMS halve.\nPour approximately 3 to 4 g of the degased PDMS in the casting form and place it for 6 min on a hot plate at 150 °C. Cool down the cured PDMS in the casting form and carefully lift the casting form wafer using a spatula.\nIn order to prevent any contamination of the microfluidic channels cover the side of the chip that was previously in contact with the wafer with tape. Carefully cut the tape along the edge of the PDMS part to remove excess PDMS.\nTo fabricate the flat PDMS halves repeat the above-mentioned steps 2.2.1 to 2.2.3 with the blank silanized wafer.\nPeel of the tape and punch fluid connection holes into the structured halves with a biopsy puncher. Protect the structures with tape during storage.\nBond the PDMS parts together by adhesive bonding using the PDMS curing agent24.",
    "Take an untreated silicon wafer and spin coat it with PDMS curing agent for 30 sec at 6,000 rpm. Take the wafer out of the spin coater.\nRemove the tape from the structured halves and place them with the structures facing downwards onto the wafer. Gently push on top of the PDMS to remove air bubbles.\nRemove the tape from the blank PDMS halves. Take a structured halve from the wafer and manually align it on top of the flat PDMS halve. Gently squeeze the part together to remove air bubbles and let the assembled chip cure for 24 hr at RT. Do not push the parts together with force as this can cause the channels to collapse.\nCut the tip of the chip along the indicator line orthogonal to the nozzle channel with a utility knife to open the outlet nozzle. Use an alignment device to ensure a straight cut, which is necessary for a straight liquid ejection. Inspect the chip under a microscope for defects in the microfluidic channels and dust particles. Put a tape over the inlet holes to protect the chips during storage.\nConnect a Woulff bottle with tubing to a dry nitrogen source and to all inlets of the LADE chip. Deposit 50 µl of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane at the bottom of the Woulff bottle and close it.\nSilanize the microfluidic channels by flushing all channels for 20 min with the nitrogen stream carrying 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrichlorosilane at a flow rate of approximately 1 ml/sec. The chips are ready for experiments and can be stored for at least several weeks at RT.\n3. Preparations for Measurement / Droplet Transport System",
    "NOTE: Build the whole droplet transport system on top of an optical table, since it is necessary to construct a stable supporting structure for the setup. A scheme of the whole droplet transportation system is depicted in Figure 6.\nInstall a custom cyclonic poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) adapter with an 50 cm attached stainless steel tube vertically. Attach the adapter to a helium source with a mass flow controller. Attach a (high-speed) camera and a lamp to the adapter on the opposite sites for droplet visualization.\nPlace a cartridge heater in the middle of the steel tube and use poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) tubing and a Legris tube connector to connect the end of the steel tube with the inlet of the membrane desolvator.\nConnect the outlet of the desolvator with another PVC tubing to a laminar flow adapter, which is directly connected to the ICPMS inlet. Connect the laminar flow adapter to an argon source with a mass flow controller and later on use it to admix Argon to achieve a stable operation condition.\nAlign the adapter as well as the steel tube vertical with a spirit level. If the alignment is not accurate, it may lead to significant losses of droplets. Insert a plug into the adapter to prevent gases leaking out during the system warm up time.\nStart all above-mentioned gas flows and devices using the settings from Table 1. Allow the system to warm up for 15 min. The cartridge heater needs 2 hr to stabilize the temperature, switch it on in advance.\nPlace the syringe pumps on a rack at the height of cyclonic helium adapter. Keep the distance between the syringe pumps and the adapter as short as possible.\n4. Measurements",
    "NOTE: The following protocol is written in general terms because of the variety of solutions and suspensions that can be used. However, cell suspensions should be diluted to a concentration of < 1 x 107 cells/ml, when single cell analysis is performed, to ensure that the majority of the droplets carry only one cell. For measurements with cells place the syringe pumps at an angle so that the outlet of the syringes point downwards and install the tubing in such a way that they point downwards.\nAttach tubing to the syringes. Load two 5 ml syringes with perfluorohexane and one 1 ml syringe with a sample solution or suspension. Remove all bubbles trapped in the syringes and tubing.\nInstall the syringes in a syringe pump and connect them to the inlets of the chip. Start the syringe pumps using the start settings from Table 1 (or higher flow rates). Give the flows 3 to 5 min to stabilize.\n\t\nRemove excess liquid from the tip of the chip with a tissue. The liquids should now eject from the chip in a straight jet. If a straight ejection cannot be achieved by wiping with a tissue replace the chip and start over with this step. \nRemove the plug from the adapter and carefully insert the chip into the adapter. Lubricate the chip with FC-40 if necessary. A chip can be used for at least 2 hr of experiments.\nChange the flow rate to be within the recommended measurement settings from Table 1. Lower flow rate of the PFH not only saves PFH but also reduces signal background, caused by isobaric interferences.\nGive the system 2-5 min to stabilize (depending on the chosen flow rates). Optimize the ICPMS for the highest signal intensity of the analytes of interest.",
    "Successively adjust the flows of all the gases on the mass flow controllers (see the recommended ranges in Table 1) until the maximum signal intensity of the analytes of interest is achieved. Tune the plasma power and the focusing lens voltages (according to the manufacturer's recommended ranges) on the ICPMS in the same way.\nSet the ICPMS to a dwell time of 10 msec (applied for the very ICPMS used but can be adjusted with other instruments to ensure a time-resolved acquisition). Start recording the signal of a particular m/z using manufacturer’s protocol.\nAfter the measurement, transfer the raw data to data analysis program for evaluation. Bin the data, given in counts per 10 msec, with a built-in-function, and plot resulting bin center values against counts. Fit each peak in the plotted frequency distribution histogram with a Gauss function. The mean and sigma of the fit represent the mean signal intensity and its standard deviation, respectively.\n5. Calibration Concept\nMeasure a single or multi-element standard solution containing the element or elements of interest at the same flow rates as the sample.\nPlace a LADE chip in a petri dish on a microscope. For a better image quality use a non-round chip. Fabricate this chip as described in step 2, but using a simple rectangular casting form instead of the partially round shaped one.\nFollow the steps 4.1 to 4.2.1 to start the droplet generation. Set the flow rates to the flow rates used in step 5.1.\nRecord images of the aqueous droplets with a high-speed camera attached to a microscope (20X objective). Use an image analysis software like the droplet morphometry and velocimetry software by Basu25 to obtain the average droplet diameter from the recordings.",
    "Use average droplet diameter to calculate the droplet volume, assuming the droplet is a spherical object.\n\t\nFrom this volume and the known concentration of an analyte in the droplet calculate the number of corresponding atoms. Divide the number of measured ions per droplet by the number of atoms to obtain the detection efficiency. Use this detection efficiency to calculate the number of atoms in an unknown sample.\n\t\tNOTE: Since the variations between individual chips are small22, it is not necessary to repeat the measurement of the droplet size for every chip or solution if the flow rates remain the same. A list of the droplet sizes and frequencies according to the specific flow rates is published by Verboket et al.22.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
