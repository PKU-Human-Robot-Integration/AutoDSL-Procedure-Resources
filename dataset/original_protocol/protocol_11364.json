Conditioned Medium (CM) Harvesting from the Bioreactor Flask\nAfter 1 week, discard all the medium in the medium reservoir of the bioreactor flask.\nRemove all the medium in the cell compartment (i.e., the CM) using a 20 mL syringe connected to a blunt fill needle.\nAdd 50-100 mL of normal medium to the medium reservoir.\nAdd 15 mL of exosome-depleted medium to the cell compartment by removing the old medium and adding fresh exosome-depleted medium using a 20 mL syringe connected to a blunt fill needle.",
    "Fill the medium reservoir of the bioreactor flask with normal medium up to 500 mL and keep the flask in the incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C) for another week.\n\tNOTE: The culture can be continued for more than a year. For step 2.2, the CM from the first harvest will not be used for exosome isolation and is discarded. For the 2nd and subsequent harvest, the CM is kept for exosome isolation.\n3.

Transfer the supernatant into a new tube and discard the pellet. Repeat this centrifugation step once more, recovering the supernatant and discarding the pellet.\nCentrifuge the supernatant from step 3.1.1 at 2,000 x g for 15 min and 4 °C and then discard pellet. Filter the recovered supernatant once through 0.22 µm filters.\nDuring pre-clearing, prepare 25% (w/w) sucrose solution in deuterium oxide by accurately weighing out 1.9 g (± 0.001 g) of sucrose in a universal tube, and then topping up with deuterium oxide until the weight reaches 7.6 g (± 0.001 g).\nFill up an ultracentrifuge tube (see Table of Materials) with 22.5 mL of pre-cleared CM. Make up the CM to 22.5 mL with 0.22 µm-filtered PBS if the current volume is less than that.",
    "Place a glass pipette (see Table of Materials) in the tube and, through it, add 3 mL of sucrose solution so that the solution forms a separate layer beneath the CM.\nCarefully place the tube containing layered CM/sucrose solution into the bucket of a swing-out rotor (see Table of Materials), and secure the bucket into the rotor.\nPlace the rotor into the ultracentrifuge (see Table of Materials) and spin at 100,000 x g for 1.5 h at 4 °C.\nCollect 2 mL of the sucrose layer and add this to an ultracentrifuge bottle (see Table of Materials) containing 20 mL of filtered PBS for a washing step.\nPlace the tubes into a fixed-angle rotor (see Table of Materials) and spin at 100,000 x g for 1.5 h at 4°C.\nCarefully remove the supernatant with a 10 mL serological pipette and resuspend the pellet with 400 µL filtered PBS. Keep this exosome stock at 4 °C or -80 °C for short-term and long-term storage respectively.\n4. Characterization of Exosome Size and Yield by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)\nMake 1:1,000-1:50,000 dilutions of the exosome stock in 1 mL (minimum 750 µL) volume so as to obtain 20-80 particles in the viewing frame of the NTA instrument (see Table of Materials) display.\nInject the diluted exosome stock into the NTA instrument sample chamber using a 1 mL syringe, and insert the temperature probe of a thermometer into the temperature probe inlet.\nSet the NTA software (see Table of Materials) for recording as follows: 3 standard measurements, 30 s each, manual temperature option unchecked; and enter the dilution factor under the Advanced tab.",
    "Set the camera level to 13 and run the capture script on the NTA software, injecting a fresh batch of sample and entering the temperature of the sample chamber when prompted after each reading.\nSet the threshold to 4 for the subsequent analysis part, and note the average modal size and particle concentration of the exosome stock from the measurements.\n5. Characterization of Exosome Purity by Particle:Protein Ratio Determination\nMeasure the protein content of the exosome stock by a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (see Table of Materials) as follows.\n\t\nPrepare the defined standards.\nPrepare the standard of the highest concentration (500 µg/mL) by adding 45 µL of BSA stock solution (2 mg/mL – provided in the assay kit) to a microcentrifuge tube, and make it up to 180 µL with PBS.\nFill 8 microcentrifuge tubes with 90 µL of PBS.\nMake serial dilutions (factor: 0.5) by taking 90 µL from the highest BSA standard and adding this into the 1st microcentrifuge tube with PBS (mix well), then taking 90 µL from this tube and adding it into the 2nd microcentrifuge tube.\nRepeat this until the 7th microcentrifuge tube. The 8th tube will be just PBS (i.e., the blank: 0 µg/mL).\nPrepare the exosome samples by making 1:2 dilution of samples with PBS in a total volume of 90 µL (45 µL of sample, 45 µL of PBS).\nPrepare the BCA working reagent mix.\n\t\t\nCalculate the total volume of BCA working reagent mix needed (50 µL per well, in duplicates, including standards).\nMix the individual BCA reagents according to the following ratio: 25 parts reagent A: 24 parts reagent B: 1 part reagent C.\nPerform the assay and analysis.",
    "Add 40 µL of each standard and exosome sample prepared above into a well of a 96-well plate (duplicates for each standard and sample).\n\t\t\tNOTE: Since this is a colorimetric assay, proper pipetting technique is crucial to achieve accurate results. Change pipettes after adding each standard/sample replicate into each of the wells\nAdd 50 µL of the protein assay working reagent mix into each well, and incubate the plate at 37 °C for 30 min.\n\t\t\tNOTE: To minimize deviations between replicates, add the protein assay working reagent into the 1st replicate of a standard/sample, followed by the 2nd replicate of the same sample/standard, before adding it to the 1st replicate of another sample/standard.\nMeasure the absorbance at 562 nm on the plate reader (see Table of Materials).\nPlot a standard curve from the absorbance values of the standards, and work out the protein concentration in each sample using the equation of the curve.\nCalculate the particle:protein ratio by dividing the exosome yield obtained earlier with the protein concentration of the exosome stock measured above.\n6. Characterization of Exosomal Marker Expression by Flow Cytometry\nIncubate 40 µL of exosomes (≥1x1011 particles/mL) with 10 µL of aldehyde/sulphate latex beads (undiluted from stock) for 15 min at room temperature (RT).\nAdd 5 µL of 100 µM BSA solution (see Table of Materials) to the exosome-bead mixture to achieve a 10 μM final concentration and incubate for 15 min at RT.\nAdd 1 mL of PBS and incubate for 75 min at RT in a microcentrifuge tube with mild agitation on a rocking shaker (~150 rpm).\nCentrifuge the suspension at 580 x g for 5 min at RT and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with 1 mL of 100 mM glycine solution (see Table of Materials) and incubate for 30 min at RT.",
    "Centrifuge the suspension for 5 min at 580 x g. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of 3% FBS/PBS (see Table of Materials).\nRepeat this washing step and resuspend the pellet in 350 µL of 3% FBS/PBS.\nDivide the suspension into 7 tubes, each containing 50 µL of suspension and incubate them with fluorophore-conjugated anti-CD81, anti-CD9 and anti-CD63 antibodies and their corresponding isotype controls (1:10 dilution), respectively, for 45 min at 4 °C. Keep 1 of the tubes as an unstained control but undergoing the same processing.\nAdd 1 mL of 3% FBS/PBS to each tube, centrifuge for 5 min at 580 x g and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet with 200-400 µL of 3% FBS/PBS and analyze the sample on the flow cytometer (see Table of Materials) under the appropriate channels.\n7. Characterization of Exosome Morphology by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)\nFix exosome aqueous dispersions at proper concentrations such as 1010 p/mL in fixing solution (see Table of Materials) for 15 min.\nPlace the samples on 300 mesh carbon coated copper grids and leave to air dry.\nNegatively stain the samples with 0.22 µm-filtered aqueous uranyl acetate (see Table of Materials) for 4 min followed by two 50% methanol/H2O wash (see Table of Materials).\nAir dry the sample.\nObserve the samples under TEM (see Table of Materials). Set the accelerating voltage at 80 kV and the spot size at 2. Use objective aperture with all samples.\n8. siRNA Encapsulation into Exosomes by Electroporation\nPre-chill the electroporation cuvette (see Table of Materials) on ice for 30 min before electroporation.",
    "Mix 7.0 µg of exosomes (32 µL from 7 x 1012 p/mL stock in PBS) with 0.33 µg of siRNA (12 µL from 2 µM stock in RNase-free water) in the microcentrifuge tube. Make up the volume to 150 µL with citric acid buffer (see Table of Materials). The exosome to siRNA molar ratio is 1:60 in this case.\nTransfer the mixture to electroporation cuvette. Cap the cuvette and place it in the cuvette holder of the electroporator (see Table of Materials). Rotate the turning wheel 180° clockwise.\n\tNOTE: The wheel must be turned completely to the locked position, in order for the cuvette to contact the electrodes.\nSelect the desired electroporation program (e.g., X-01, X-05, A-20, T-20, T-30, etc.) and start electroporation by pressing the Start button.\n\tNOTE: A successful pulse is indicated by showing “OK” on the display.\nOnce electroporated, remove the cuvette after turning back the wheel 180° counter-clockwise. Withdraw the sample from the cuvette with the plastic pipette for further processing.\n9. Removal of Free siRNA Using Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)\nEquilibrate the SEC column (2.9 cm [H] x 1.3 cm [W]; see Table of Materials) by passing 3.5 mL of filtered PBS twice.\nDissolve 150 μL of electroporated sample in 350 μL of filtered PBS and transfer this to the SEC column to perform the free siRNA removal.\nCollect the first 500 μL fraction that eluted from the column (F0).\nAdd 500 μL of filtered PBS to the column and collect the next 500 μL fraction (F1).\nRepeat the above step until a total of 10 x 500 μL fractions (up to F9) is collected. F1 and F2 should contain the siRNA-encapsulated exosomes.\nWash the column with filtered PBS (twice, at least) to remove any sample residues.",
    "10. In Vitro Uptake of siRNA-Loaded Exosomes into PANC-1 Cells\nSeed PANC-1 cells in 24-well flat-bottom plates (see Table of Materials) at a density of 50,000 cells per well 24 h prior to the uptake study and incubate the cells in the incubator (5% CO2, 37 °C).\nElectroporate HEK-293 exosomes (7.0 μg) with Atto655-siRNA (0.33 μg) as per Step 8.\nPurify electroporated exosome as per Step 9 and resuspend in 100 μL of PBS.\nAdd 50 μL of the electroporated exosomes to PANC-1 cell and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 4 h.\nCollect cells after incubation.\nWash the cells with 1 mL of sterile PBS and resuspend in 200 μL of PBS in polystyrene round-bottom tube (see Table of Materials).\nAnalyze cells by flow cytometer (see Table of Materials) with 10,000 events acquired per sample.\n\tNOTE: Un-electroporated exosome-siRNA mixture samples and untreated cells with filtered PBS were used as controls."
