    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMouse perfusion and post fixation of the spinal cord (part 1)\nTiming: 2 days\nThis first part describes the perfusion of the mouse and the post fixation of spinal cord tissue which can be then stored for several months.\nInject 200 mg/kg Metamizole (stock concentration: 100 mg/mL, dissolved in saline) intraperitoneally 30 min prior to perfusion followed by deep isoflurane anesthesia. Toe pinch reflection is applied to monitor the depth of anesthesia. It usually takes 5–10 min to achieve deep anesthesia.\nThe type of drugs/anesthesia might vary depending on the approved animal protocol. Another frequently drug alternative prior to perfusion is Ketamine/Xylazine (Ketamine: 50–80 mg/kg; Xylazine: 5–10 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection.\nAfter the mouse is in deep anesthesia, lay it on its back and pin it down on its four limbs.\nUse forceps and dissecting scissors to open the skin and expose the chest cavity.\nCut open the diaphragm using standard scissors and be careful to not pierce the heart.\nGrab at the base of the sternum, cut through the ribcage and lift it to expose the heart.\nInsert the perfusion needle in the apex of the left ventricle and cut open the right atrium with a small cut (by use of fine scissors) to perfuse the mice with 1× PBS at room temperature (20°C–23°C) for 5 min with a flow rate of 3 mL/min flush following with 4% PFA in PBS for 15 min at the same flowrate.\nEvaluate success of perfusion by checking whether liver and muscles became pale and hardened (if blood was not completely removed from the liver, the perfusion is considered unsuccessful).\nAfter successful perfusion, remove the mouse’s head, tail, the fur of the back and the extremities as well as internal intestinal organs to allow better liquid exposure.",
    "Place the remaining body into a 50 mL Falcon tube with 4% PFA in PBS for immersion postfixation overnight (12–14 h). Alternatively, to reduce chemical and storage usage, dissect out the spinal cord immediately as described below and store it in a 10 mL Falcon tube with 4% PFA in PBS for immersion postfixation overnight (12–14 h) at 4°C.\nTransfer body/spinal cord into PBS with 0.02% sodium azide for storage. Spinal cord can be stored in this way for several months, however we usually process the spinal cord the following days.\nCritical: Evaluate success of perfusion by checking whether liver and muscles became pale and hard. Also check after laminectomy if the arteria spinalis anterior is without any residue of blood. Inadequate perfusion will result in poor immunohistochemistry stainings (see troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1], Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nDissection and transverse sectioning of a spinal segment (part 2)\nThis section explains the dissection of identified spinal segments and subsequent vibratome sectioning.\nDissection of a spinal segment\nTiming: 30 min\nHere, we describe the dissection steps to isolate individual spinal segments (see also Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nDispose PBS 0.02% sodium azide and wash the mouse carcass two times with PBS.\nPin the carcass with its paws ventral side up on a Sylgard layer of a dissecting chamber filled with PBS and remove all organs, muscles and connective tissue using “Dumont 2SP Forceps” and “Spring Scissors – angled to side” by Fine scientific tools GmbH to clear your view on the spinal column (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], first panel).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1493-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissection of identified spinal segments",
    "Image series shows step-by-step dissection of a P14 murine spinal cord. From left to right: ventral view of the perfused mouse carcass with intact vertebral column, after laminectomy, isolated spinal cord and zoomed-in lumbar region with identified ventral roots (dotted white lines) and spinal segments (gray dotted lines). Note that the L6 (white arrow) ventral root is significantly smaller than the L5 (yellow arrow head), making it a reliable landmark for identification of spinal segments. Scale bar = 5 mm.\nGain access to spinal cord by a ventral rostral-to-caudal laminectomy using “Dumont #5 Forceps” and “Spring Scissors – angled to side” by Fine scientific tools GmbH together with a binocular microscope with 5× magnification (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], second panel, Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCarefully dissect out the entire spinal cord in rostral-to-caudal direction and pin it into the Sylgard chamber using the “Vannas Spring Scissors - 3 mm Cutting Edge” and the “Dumont #5 Forceps” by FST GmbH (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], third panel, Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nCarefully free the spinal cord from the Dura mater and pull all ventral roots towards the rostral direction to reveal their point of origin (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], fourth panel).\nThe lumbar ventral roots gradually increase by size from L1 to L5. In contrast, L6 ventral root decreases again in size, making L5 ventral root a reliable landmark for the identification of spinal cord segments. Count from L5 ventral root to the desired ventral root of interest and cut out right underneath this root and the next rostral root with a scalpel to isolate your spinal segment of choice (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], fourth panel).\nCritical: Be very careful with the dissection. Ripping off a single ventral root can accidentally result in false identification of the spinal segment.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.",
    "Video S1. Dissection of the spinal cord, related to steps 13 and 14\nTransverse sectioning of a spinal segment\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step describes the transverse sectioning of a spinal segment with the vibratome prior to immunohistochemistry (see also Videos S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2] and S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]). In our experience, vibratome sections have three major advantages compared to cryosections: 1. no cryo-preservation is required, 2. thicker sections are possible, which allows better visualization of entire motor neuron cell bodies and enlarged dendritic trees, 3. better preservation of tissue and cell structure. These 75-μm-sections are suitable for confocal and Stimulated Emission Depletion (STED) analysis.\nEmbedding of spinal cord segments into Agar buffer (Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nMix 5 g of Agar and with a total volume of 100 mL 1× PBS in a 250 mL beaker. Heat up the solution in the beaker at 340°C and stirred at 400 rpm for 10 min to dissolve Agar completely in 1× PBS.\nPour 8 mL hot Agar (190°C) into disposable weighing pans and wait until it stops fuming.\nCarefully place the spinal cord segment into the warm Agar (80°C) using forceps.\nWhen the Agar block is solidified, trim it (with the aid of safety blades) accordingly to the size of the spinal segment. Tip: leave a ∼2–3 mm extra Agar on the bottom of the spinal segment to glue this side to the platform of the vibratome.\nProceed directly to vibratome sectioning and make sure the Agar block is covered in 1× PBS to avoid drying out the tissue (in case you cannot proceed immediately, Agar block can be stored at least one day in 1× PBS).\nTransverse sectioning of the spinal segment (Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3])",
    "Glue the Agar block containing the spinal segment in a rostral-vertical orientation onto the platform of the vibratome with Super Glue and wait at least one minute.\nTransfer the platform into the cutting chamber of the vibratome filled with 1× PBS.\nCut the segment into 75 μm thick slices with a speed of 7 and frequency 7 (Leica vibratome settings). Collect each free floating spinal section directly with a brush and transfer it into 1× PBS in a modified 12-well plate filled with 5 mm Sylgard blackened with graphite powder (one spatula of powder per 24 mL) and Netwell insert (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) to facilitate handling of the sections during immunohistochemistry. Avoid adding more than six spinal cord sections into one Netwell insert to ensure proper antibody penetration.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1493-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Modified 12-well plate for immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nLeft panel: top view from a modified 12-well plate filled with graphite powder blackened Sylgard. Right panel: side view from one well with a Netwell insert for easy transfer of the spinal cord section during IHC.

    "This part includes the staining procedure of sequential spinal cord sections. These mounted sections can be subsequently scanned with confocal or super-resolution STED microscopy. Important: the sections stay in the same Netwell insert during the entire staining protocol. Only the 12-well plates filled with the indicated solutions will be exchanged for every step as described below. Therefore, a minimum of two modified 12-well plates are required for performing immunohistochemistry (one 12-well plate with the sections in the Netwell inserts which will be transferred to second 12-well plate containing already the next step solutions). Thereby, the spinal cord sections do not have to be touched and remain intact (see also the end of Video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nIncubate sections in blocking buffer (5% normal donkey serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) for 90 min at room temperature. Important: each well requires a minimum volume of 700 μL solution per well for each step.\nPrepare primary antibody combinations according to the antibody list (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]) with blocking buffer.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1493_7.csv\nIncubate spinal cord sections in primary antibodies overnight (12–14 h) on an orbital shaker at a speed of 50 rpm at room temperature.\nNext day, wash sections with 1× PBS for 6 × 10 min.\nPrepare secondary antibody solutions for the corresponding primary antibodies (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]).\nIncubate sections with secondary antibodies for 3 h at room temperature to visualize primary antibodies.",
    "Critical: (Important for super-resolution STED) the required photostable secondary antibodies for STED from Abberior anti-rabbit are only available made in goat (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). The ChAT antibody is also made in goat and requires a donkey anti-goat secondary antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 488. Therefore, the donkey anti-goat secondary antibody labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 will label the secondary antibodies from Abberior when applied together. For this combination, apply secondary antibodies sequentially, but not simultaneously.\nApply first the donkey anti-goat Alexa-488,\nWash the sections 3 × 10 min with PBS\nApply the Abberior antibody made in goat.\nNote: This will resolve the cross-binding of secondary antibodies.\nWash sections with PBS for 3 × 10 min.\nCreate a hydrophobic barrier on the glass slide with a PAP pen liquid blocker around the slide perimeter.\nMount spinal sections on glass slides with Glycerol/PBS (7:3) mounting medium using a fine brush.\nFirst, carefully take out a single section from the PBS solution within the Netwell insert by lifting it up with the brush. The section will be wrapped around the brush.\nThen put the section within the hydrophobic barrier by slowly rolling the brush against the glass slide. The section will attach completely intact to the glass slide.\nUse a small piece of tissue to remove remaining PBS on the glass slide to avoid sliding of the sections.\nRepeat this with all sections from the same well and place them next to each other. Recommendation: Do not mount more than six sections per slide. Three sections in the upper row and three sections in the lower row.\nPut a drop of Glycerol/PBS (∼60 μL) carefully in the center of the glass slide.\nPut cover glass on the slides, push off bubbles and remove extra mounting medium.",
    "Seal the cover glass and slide with nail polish and store them at 4°C. Sections can be stored for several months. Do not start imaging before nail polish is completely hardened (>1 h).\nCritical: Use highly photostable secondary antibodies for detailed scanning of small structures with STED microscopy. Secondary antibodies labeled with a fluorochrome (Alexa Fluor and Cy series) usually used for immunohistochemistry and confocal imaging will bleach fast (troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3], Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]) and cannot be used for STED analysis.\nConfocal and STED imaging of premotor synapses (part 4a)\nThis section describes in detail imaging acquisition of premotor synapses by confocal microscopy and distribution of presynaptic proteins by STED microscopy.\nConfocal imaging acquisition\nTiming: ∼1 h per section, total of 3 h per animal\nConfocal scanning is applied to count premotor synapses. The goal is to scan at least five complete motor neuron cell bodies and ten motor neuron dendrites up to a distance of 100 μm from the soma per section. Three sections per spinal segment are scanned to get a total of at least 15 motor neurons and 30 dendrites per animal. We used here a SP8 Leica confocal microscope.\nFirst scan the spinal cord section with a 10× objective to double check the gross morphology and get a sense of the relative position within the spinal cord. An intact transverse spinal cord section (no holes or damage) and a crisp choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) and vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) staining are desirable for optimal results (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, left panel).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1493-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Confocal imaging of proprioceptive synapses",
    "(A) Confocal images of an overview scan of a P14 spinal hemicord (left panel) with a 10× objective and zoomed-in scan of the motor neuron pool (right panel) with a 63× objective using ChAT (green) as a motor neuron marker in the ventral horn and VGluT1 (magenta) to visualize proprioceptive synapses. Scale bar, hemicord = 200 μm, motor neuron pool = 20 μm.\n(B) Six example confocal planes of the same ChAT+ motor neuron (note that there will be more single optical planes) in a z-stack to quantify every VGluT1+ proprioceptive synapse on the motor neuron cell body. Scale bar = 20 μm.\n(C) Left panel: confocal image of a ChAT+ motor neuron with its innervating VGluT1+ proprioceptive synapses. Dotted white line marks the motor neuron outline. Right panel: same scan as left, but without the ChAT signal for better overview. White arrow marks proprioceptive synapses innervating the motor neuron. Yellow arrowheads mark VGluT1+ synapses that are not in contact with the motor neuron and therefore cannot be included in the analysis. Scale bar = 10 μm.\nFor imaging premotor synapses, magnify on the ventral ChAT+ motor neuron pool with a 63× glycerol objective with a zoom factor of 1 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A, right panel). Alternatively, a 40× objective with a zoom factor of 1.5 can be used.\nUse an image stack to ∼50 μm of the 75 μm thick transverse spinal section avoiding the edges of the section (top and bottom), which usually contain higher background due to unspecific binding of secondary antibodies on the section’s surface.\nAdjust laser intensity appropriately to improve signal-to-noise ratio for each channel.",
    "To include every (VGluT1+) synapse as well as the entire cell bodies of motor neurons, sequentially scan the 50 μm stack at 0.4 μm z-steps with a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels, frequency of 100 Hz, and line average of 4. Tip: Use bidirectional scan for faster imaging acquisition, on the assumption that bidirectional scanning does not result in “doubling” of structures, indicative of improper laser alignment.\nOnce the scan is finished, go through the stack to ensure proper intensity of the signal throughout the stack and overall image quality (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B). In certain cases, laser strength compensation can be used (available through a software module).\nRepeat procedure for two more sections from the same segment for a total of three sections per animal.\nSave data file and proceed to image analysis.\nSTED imaging acquisition\nTiming: 10 min per synapse, total of 6 h per animal\nSTED imaging is applied to visualize the distribution of presynaptic proteins. As a proof-of-principle, we scanned the VGluT1 and ChAT channel in confocal mode and used the improved resolution of STED microscopy to distinguish individual spots of the presynaptic protein Munc13-1, which is currently discussed as a possible candidate for vesicular release sites (Böhme et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Karlocai et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Sakamoto et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). We used here an Expert Line Abberior microscope.\nTo visualize the distribution of presynaptic proteins, scan the vibratome sections with STED microscopy stained with appropriate photostable secondary antibodies suitable for STED (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3], Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nFirst locate ChAT+ motor neurons in the ventral horn with a 60× oil objective using the confocal mode.\nZoom into a selected proprioceptive synapse of interest with the 60× oil objective and visualize it in confocal mode (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], first and second panel)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1493-Fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4. STED imaging of presynaptic protein Munc13-1\nFirst panel: confocal single plane image of a VGluT1+ proprioceptive synapse (magenta) onto ChAT+ motor neuron (green) of a P14 WT animal. Dotted white line marks the proprioceptive synapses. Second panel: confocal single plane image of Munc13-1 distribution (cyan) within a proprioceptive synapse. Third panel: STED image of the presynaptic Munc-13 distribution (cyan). Fourth panel: merge of confocal single pane images of ChAT, VGluT1 and STED image of Munc13-1. Scale bar = 1 μm.\nSet a z-Stack for the synapse of interest with the confocal laser.\nAdjust laser intensity appropriately to improve signal-to-noise ratio for each channel.\nSequentially scan the synapse in confocal mode for the ChAT+ motor neuron and VGluT1+ proprioceptive synapse, but scan the intrasynaptic protein Munc13-1 in STED mode. For STED, use a pixel size of 20 nm, a dwell time of 6 μs, and a line accumulation of 3 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nRepeat for ten synapses per animals.\nAnalysis of premotor synapses (part 4b)\nQuantification of synaptic number\nTiming: 1 day\nThis part of the analysis describes the quantification of confocal images of premotor synapses onto motor neurons. We usually conduct our analysis with LAS X free software from Leica, but any other software (e.g., Fiji-ImageJ, Zeiss ZEN) is suitable (see also Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]). The image analysis of STED images critically depends on the scientific question (for recent examples of analysis of STED images of Munc13, see e.g., Böhme et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Fukaya et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Holderith et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Karlocai et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Liu et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).",
    "Critical: Count all proprioceptive synapses on the cell body of the motor neuron to avoid biased analysis with appropriate software (see point 46, Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]). To do so, include only motor neurons of which the entire cell body has been scanned with the z-stack. Importantly, only ∼5% of the proprioceptive synapse are located on the cell body and the majority (95%) are on motor neuron proximal dendrites (Mentis et al., 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Rotterman et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Therefore, the analysis of synaptic density on proximal dendrites is critical to make a statement of the quantity of premotor synapses on motor neurons.\nGo through the z-stack and mark motor neurons of which their entire cell body has been included in this scan.\nDigitally zoom onto one motor neuron cell body and slowly go through the z-stack marking every single VGluT1+ proprioceptive synapse over the entire surface of the motor neuron soma by applying manually a multiple point counter tool such as LAS X or Fiji-ImageJ. Go back and forward through the z-stack of the entire cell body to ensure no omission or double counting of synapses (see Video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]).\nRepeat this procedure for at least 5 motor neurons of one z-Stack and a total of 15 motor neurons per animal.\nProceed with the quantification of the synaptic density of the dendrites. Count the number of VGluT1+ synapses over the entire surface of the primary dendrite up to a distance of 100 μm from the soma as previously established (Mentis et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).",
    "To do so, follow the ChAT+ dendrites originating from the motor neuron soma throughout the z-Stack and divide the length of the dendrite into 50 μm long areas. The first dendritic bin was from 0-50 μm (bin 0–50 μm), the second one from 50-100 μm (bin 50–100 μm) measured from the motor neuron cell body (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1493-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Analysis of dendritic synaptic density\nUpper panel: example of a single confocal plane of a ChAT+ motor neuron (green) and VGluT1+ (magenta) proprioceptive synapse from a z-stack of a P14 WT mouse. White dotted lines mark motor neuron soma and two primary dendrites. Middle panel: same image as above but ChAT channel has been deactivated for better overview. The length of the proximal primary dendrites is divided into 0–50 μm (green line) and 50–100 μm (gray line) bins away from the soma. Scale bar = 25 μm Bottom panel: magnified image of a proximal dendrite (ChAT+, green, dotted white line) with innervating proprioceptive synapses (VGluT1, magenta). Scale bar = 10 μm. Note: dendrites cannot always be followed up to 100 μm length in a single confocal plane. To follow the dendrite in detail, go through the z-stack and quantify the synapses in every panel.\nCount every VGluT1+ proprioceptive synapse in the restricted bin area by going through the z-stack and calculate the density in the selected bin as number of synapses/dendritic length (i.e., 50 μm)).\nRepeat this for at least ten dendrites per z-Stack and a total of a minimum of 30 dendrites per animal, for at least three animals per genotype.",
    "Critical: Count only synapses which are in direct contact with a ChAT signal. Exclude synapses which are close to motor neurons, but are not in apposition with dendrites (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C). ChAT antibodies label α- and γ-motor neurons. Importantly, γ-motor neurons receive less than one proprioceptive synapse on average compared to ∼30 proprioceptive synapses innervating α-motor neurons (Friese et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). To avoid contamination of γ-motor neurons apply NeuN as an additional marker, see troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5], Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nVideo S4.
