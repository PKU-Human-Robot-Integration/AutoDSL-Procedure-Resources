    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nRBP knockout and genetic reconstitution in mammalian cells\nTiming: 3–4 weeks\nThis Major Step describes the procedure to generate RBP-KO cell lines, from which wild type RNPs or RNPs deficient of a given RBP can be purified. We also describe how to genetically rescue these KO cells with the RBP cDNA. These cell lines can be used to dissect RNP’s cellular functions that depend on the contribution of a given RBP (Chen et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10], Chen et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11], Chen et al., 2020b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). Finally, genetically reconstituted cell lines expressing an epitope-tagged RBP provide a convenient source for recombinant RBPs to be used in the subsequent biochemical reconstitution (Major step 5).\nGenomic targeting of the RBP by Cas9-sgRNA RNPs\nSeed 3 × 104 HeLa or mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in a 48-well plate one night before the transfection.\nTransfect reconstituted Cas9-sgRNA RNPs (20 pmol of Cas9 protein, and 20 pmol of sgRNA), together with 2 pmol of pcDNA-GFP, using 1.5 μL of Lipofectamine 2000 diluted in Opti-mem.\nAlternatives: plasmid-borne Cas9 and sgRNAs, e.g., PX459 (Ran et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib26]), can also deliver genome-editing to cells by transfection, also see the discussion in Preparative step 1.\nNote: co-transfect with the GFP-expressing vector enables the enrichment of positive-transfectants by FACS-sorting.\n3 days post-transfection, sort GFP-expressing single cells into two 96-plates.\nAlternatives: seed 1000 cells sparsely in a 10cm dish for cell cloning.\nPick single HeLa colonies after about 14 days, and about 10 days for mESCs.\nPause Point: Prepare cells for colony screeening and freeze down a replicate plate.\nNote: No medium change is necessary during clonal growth.\nScreen for KO clones based on the RBP expression using western blotting or immunofluorescence.\nTo analyze the genomic sequence of the targeted locus, design two PCR primer pairs,",
    "Inside amplicon for detecting unedited alleles: within the two sgRNA cutting sites.\nOutside amplicon for detecting edited alleles: flanking the region to be deleted.\nNote: Successful homozygous deleted clones are expected to be negative for the inside amplicon, while positive for the outside amplicon.\nThe outside amplicon can be further cloned into a TOPO vector, followed by colony sequencing to examine the exact genomic composition post-editing.\nNote: we routinely observe ∼25% clones with monoallelic deletions and ∼7% clones with biallelic deletions.\nGenetic rescuing the KO cell line with an epitope-tagged cDNA of RBP.\nClone cDNA of the RBP in-frame with an epitope tag, into a lentiviral packaging vector such as pCDH-CMV-puro.\nCritical: since the pCDH contains long terminal repeats (LTRs) that are prone to recombination, we recommend propagating them in the Stbl3 stain with reduced recombination frequency.\nFor lentivirus packaging, we transfect 293T cells seeded one-night prior in a 10-cm dish at 50% confluency.\ndilute the following 3rd generation packaging plasmids in 1 mL Opti-MEM:\npMDLg/pRRE: 4.5ug\npCMV-VSVG: 2.5ug\npRSV-Rev: 1.5ug\npCDH-tag-RBP-PuroR or pCDH-GFP-PuroR control: 7ug\nIn a separate tube, resuspend 50 μL of lipofectamine in 1 mL of OptiMEM.\nCombine and mix contents from two tubes, incubate at an ambient temperature around 22°Cfor 20 min.\nAdd the 2mL cocktail into 293T cells in Opti-mem, incubate for 6 h under standard tissue culture condition.\nReplace the dish with a complete culture medium.\n48 h post-transfection, collect the 1st batch of culture medium, and store it at 4°C; replenish the remaining cells with fresh medium.\nCritical: protect the viral supernatant from lights, and handle it with biosafety level 2 precautions.\n72 h post-transfection, combine both supernatants, pass through a 0.45 μM polyethersulfone filter using a syringe.\nCritical: do not use the 0.22 uM filter, as virus particles may be damaged.",
    "To concentrate the viral supernatant, add 1/3 the volume of Lenti-X concentrator, incubate 10–14 h at 4°C. Protect it from light.\nAlternatives: the filtered unconcentrated viral supernatant can be directly used to infect cells.\nThe next day, spin at 1500 × g for 45min at 4°C\nResuspend the visible viral pellet in an 800 μL complete culture medium containing 10% FBS. This concentrated viral solution can be directly applied to infect target cell hosts.\nAlternatives: concentrated viral supernatants can be aliquoted, snap-frozen, and stored in −80°C for future infection. Note potential drop of viral titer can occur during freezing and thawing.\nTo infect target host cells, seed 5 × 104 cells per well of a 6-well plate with a complete medium containing 10 μg/mL polybrene, incubate for 1 h in the TC incubator.\nSwirl-in 100 μL of concentrated viral solution into the culture medium.\nNote: GFP expression in the GFP-transduced cells should be visible by 24 h, which can be used to track the progression of the transgene expression.\n48 h post-infection or whenever most control cells become GFP-positive, begin antibiotic selection by adding 2 ng/μL puromycin.\nNote: We expect complete killing of the mock-transduced control cell within 2 days; while expecting pCDH-transduced cells to show minimum cell death, if at all. Minimum cell death indicates efficient viral transduction. These rescued cells can be further expanded in reduced puromycin.\nCritical: To maintain stable expression of the transgene, avoid extensive passages; instead, go back to a low-passage stock.\nInstructions and examples for immunofluorescence, single-molecule RNA FISH, and biochemical assays can be found in (Chen et al., 2020a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11], Chen et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10])\nRNP purification and biochemical reconstitution\nTiming: 5 days",
    "Efficient cellular fractionations can achieve a significant enrichment for RNPs. Cellular compartments and fractionation procedures may differ per RNP of interest. Here we describe a fractionation procedure relevant for multiple RNPs that differentially distribute between the cytosolic, nucleoplasm, and chromatin compartments. Specifically, we avoid detergent usage, minimize mechanical disruptions, and rely on high salt extraction; thereby, a pool of RNP complexes with high solubility, specific activity, and native folding states are preferentially extracted and enriched. The subsequent purification step depends on an affinity-purified, homemade antibody to purify endogenous RNP complexes with native stoichiometry and specific activity (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]), avoiding potential complications introduced by epitope tagging or overexpression of exogenous constructs (Chiba et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14], Stern et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib29]).\nQuality controls during extract preparation and RNP purification are crucial because introducing molecular aggregates and insolubles into the icSHAPE reaction can complicate data interpretation. For QC of RNP purification and production, assaying a specific activity of RNPs is preferred, as shown with the telomerase assay in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. If such an assay is not available, it is recommended to track the abundance of RNP components in solubilized fractions, e.g., quantitatively assessing protein or RNA levels in “Input extract”, “antibody-depleted extract”, and “eluate” using western and northern blottings.\nFractionate cells into a cytosolic extract “S100”, a high salt nuclear extract, and a DNase I-sensitive chromatin extract.",
    "Note: The procedure is modified from (Dignam et al., 1983[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]), and was described in (Chen et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). For a large-scale extraction, we grow a minimum of 10 ml of Packed Cell Volume (PCV), an equivalent of ∼3 × 109 cells. The large-scale ensures a sufficient amount of purified RNPs for multiple biochemical and structural readouts with necessary replicates, particularly helpful for low-expression RNPs, e.g., telomerase RNP - a couple of hundred assembled RNPs per HeLa cell (Xi and Cech, 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib32]).\nAlternatives: the original Dignam extraction has also been adopted at a smaller scale, with 3× 15 cm tissue culture plates ∼about 1 × 108 mammalian cells (Folco et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib21]). The smaller scale is sufficient to study more abundant RNPs, such as snRNPs with about 0.5 million copies per cell (Castle et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7], Kiss and Filipowicz, 1992[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]).\nCritical: All tubes, homogenizers, and buffers should be pre-chilled before contacting cells and extracts. For all buffers, 1 mM DTT, 200 μM PMSF, RNase inhibitor, and a protease inhibitor cocktail should be added immediately upon usage. RNase-free grade reagents and practices should be used throughout.\nHarvest and wash cells with PBS, aspirate supernatant thoroughly, and measure the PCV (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/620-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Key visualizations during the Dignam nuclear extraction in Major step 3\n(A–D) 293T cells or their nuclei stained by 0.2% Trypan Blue. Intact cells, unstained bright dots; nuclei are stained as darker dots. Pictures were obtained with a 5× objective; yellow scale bars denote for 100 μmM.\n(E) measure packed cell volume (PCV) upon cell harvesting.\n(F) post-hypotonic inbuation, cells swell in volume.\n(G) post-ultracentrifugation visualization.\nCritical: high viability (>95%) of starting cells is crucial for the procedure, as shown in the trypan blue-stained 293T cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).",
    "Resuspend the packed cells in 5× PCV of hypotonic Buffer A (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) with gentle pipetting.\nIncubate the cell suspension on ice for an exact 10min to let cells swell.\nSpin down cells 250 × g for 5min at 4°C, and remove the supernatant.\nNote: as noted in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F, the PCV increased from 40mL to 55mL due to cell swelling, also see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B.\nCritical: post-hypotonic cells become fragile, and pre-mature rupturing of cells is often observed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B). The timing and gentle handling are keys to minimize rupturing prior to homogenization.\nResuspend the pellet in 2× PCV of Buffer A, and transfer to a Dounce homogenizer.\nhomogenize cell suspension with a LOOSE pestle, until 90% of cells are positively stained with Trypan Blue (0.2% final concentration) under a light microscope (see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C for an example of incomplete homogenization, and Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D for the desired endpoint).\nCritical: avoid over-homogenizing the nuclei, which compromises the quality of the final extract. The minimum necessary number of strokes for each cell type needs to be determined empirically (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C and 2D).\nSpin down the homogenates at 25,000 × g for 20min at 4°C.\nTransfer the supernatant, add 11.1% (v/v) of glycerol and 11.1% (v/v) of Buffer B (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) to reconstitute the final S100.\nNote: the salt concentration of the final S100 extract is ∼280 mM.\nNote: S100 contains soluble cytosolic molecules and a fraction of nuclear molecules that inevitably leak out.\nCritical: Avoid collecting debris from the nuclei pellet; also avoid introducing any insoluble debris from the S100 supernatant; re-centrifuge the S100 to pellet any insoluble if necessary.",
    "Aspirate and discard any leftover supernatant with a pipette and add Buffer C (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) to the nuclei pellet, swirl gently to resuspend, and transfer to a homogenizer.\nNote: For every 1mL of starting PCV - an equivalent of ∼3 × 108 mammalian cells, add 0.83mL of Buffer C.\nHomogenize nuclei by a couple of strokes using a LOOSE glass pestle.\nCritical: avoid over-homogenizing the nuclei resuspension.\nPour the homogenates into a chilled beaker.\nNote: choose a properly sized beaker to allow efficient mixing of the solution (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1])\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Key visuals for the Dignam nuclear extraction, related to Major step 3\nMajor Step-3k: transfer nuclei into a chilled beaker with appropriate size.\nMajor Step-3l: drop-wise add 5M NaCl to the beaker while maintaining gentle stirring.\nMajor Step-3m: the pellet becomes viscous and gooey; transfer to a centrifuge tube.\nTo extract nuclear molecules with high salt, drop-wise apply 5M NaCl solution to the homogenate, while maintaining a gentle stirring motion (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). The final concentration of NaCl should be around 0.42 M.\nNote: use the equation below to calculate the volume of 5M NaCl needed:\nNote: with all the NaCl added, the suspension should turn viscous and gooey. (see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nPour the nuclei suspension into an ultracentrifugation tube, e.g. type Ti-45, with care.\nGently rotate the tube for 30 min at 4°C.\nUltracentrifuge at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nAliquot and store the supernatant as the high salt nuclear extract.\nNote: a quality nuclear extract should be visually transparent without debris (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G). Harsh handling or over-homogenizing of cells or nuclei can introduce unwanted damages to the chromatin, resulting in insoluble debris that refrains from centrifugation. See troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "To release chromatin-bound molecules, rinse the pellet with PBS twice, and resuspend in a volume of 1x DNaseI digestion buffer (400 Kunitz Unit/mL) that is proportional to the starting cell number.\nNote: use 200 Kunitz Units of DNase I per 1 × 107 cells (for the recipe of a 10× stock buffer, see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nGently rotate for 30 min at 37°C\nSpin down 21,000 × g, 1min at RT to pellet any insoluble.\nStore the supernatant as the salt-resistant, DNase-sensitive chromatin-bound fraction.\nNote: for QC of the chromatin-bound extracts by western blotting, histones and other chromatin-associating factors such as PCNA should be relatively enriched; whereas, the β-tubulin signal should be relatively depleted.\nAffinity-purify endogenous RNPs\nCritical: For all buffers used here, add 0.2 mM DTT (reduced to preserve IgG), 200 μM PMSF, RNase inhibitor, and a protease inhibitor cocktail immediately upon usage. RNase-free grade reagents and practices should be used throughout.\nNote: high-salt (420 – 450 mM) purification aims to reduce non-specific interactions, and to enrich salt-resistant, high-confidence components of RNP complexes.\nAlternatives: to preserve the salt-sensitive RNP components, dilute the nuclear extract 3-fold with 0.42× Buffer C (diluted in ddH2O) – the final NaCl will be ∼140 mM. Also, adjust NaCl to 140 mM in subsequent steps. Otherwise, proceed to the high salt purification as follows.\nSpinning down the input extract at 21,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. Transfer the cleared supernatant to a new tube.\nWash Protein A-conjugated agarose beads with PBS twice.\nBlock the beads twice with nuclear buffer420 w/ BSA (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]), each with 10min rotation at 4°C.\nWash beads in nuclear buffer420 w/o BSA (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).",
    "Optional: a large batch of blocked and equilibrated beads can be stored as a 50% slurry in 4°C for up to 6 months.\nPreclear the extract with the prewashed Protein A beads by gently rotating at 4°C for 1 h.\nNote: per 1mL of extract, use 60 μL of prewashed protein A beads at 50% slurry.\nPellet the beads at 7000 × g for 30 s at 4°C; transfer the supernatant to a new tube as the precleared nuclear extract.\nTo affinity-purify RNP complexes from nuclear extracts, add 30 μg of purified anti-RBP antibody into 1mL of precleared nuclear extract.\nGently rotate at 4°C for 60 min.\nPipet 60 μL of the prewashed beads (50% slurry, from step 4-d) into the extract with an enlarged tip.\nGently rotate at 4°C for no more than 4 h.\nWash 4 times with ∼30 bead-volume of Lys450 buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nAlternatives: to preserve salt-sensitive components of the RNP, wash instead with a milder NP150 buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nWash for an additional time with 1x direct assay buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nResuspend the RNP-bound beads as a 50% slurry in 1x direct assay buffer w/ glycerol (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). Snap freeze aliquots and store in −80°C freezer.\nNote: set aside a small aliquot of the input, precleared, and depleted extracts, as well as immunoprecipitated fractions; analyze the RNP abundance in each by western and northern blotting or specific activity assays (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for an example).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/620-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. The anti-TERT antibody efficiently purifies and quantitatively depletes the endogenous telomerase RNP from nuclear extracts",
    "The ladder-like bands are Telomerase Repeated Amplification Protocol (TRAP) products- specific activity pattern of the telomerase RNP, serving as a surrogate to evaluate the presence of active telomerase RNP in each fraction tested (Major Step 4). The anti-TERT antibody （T421） was produced by immunizing a rabbit with the amino acid 421-493 of the human TERT protein fused with MBP, and affinity-purified using the GST-tagged antigen, as in Preparation 3-9. 1x and 3x denote the relative amount of each fraction assayed to demonstrate the linear range; 1x representing the corresponding percentage of total fraction volume as indicated for Input (1%), depleted (1%), and IP (2%).\nAlternatives: competitive elution of the bound RNP with 4× bed-volume of 0.6 μg/μL of the antigen peptide. Perform 5× sequential elutions at an ambient temperature around 22°C, 15min each. Pool peak fractions, which can be concentrated using a 10 kDa centrifugal filter device.\nBiochemical reconstitution of purified RBP with RNPs.\nExpress and purify recombinant RBP by affinity purification (See troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: the genetically rescued CRISPR cell line generated in Major Step-2 serves as a cellular source for epitope-tagged RBP, which can be conveniently purified and eluted with commercially available reagents.\nCritical: To facilitate the reconstitution of RBP with the corresponding RNA component of the RNP, it is helpful to vacant the RBP’s RNA binding site by removing endogenous RNA species that copurify with the RBP.\nTo remove copurified RNAs, immobilize the RBP onto its corresponding affinity resin.\nResuspend the resin in Nuclear Buffer420 w/ BSA containing 0.1 μg/μL RNase A, and gently rotate for 1 h at 4°C.\nOptional: the supernatant contains RNA-bridged protein partners of the RBP, and can be further analyzed by proteomic approaches.\nWash the RBP-bound resin with a 100× bed-volume of Lys450.",
    "Critical: it is imperative to thoroughly wash the resin to minimize the carryover of RNase to downstream applications that are RNase-sensitive, such as reconstitution, assaying RNP activity, and probing for RNP structure.\nCompetitive elute the RBP from the resin by rotating in 1x direct assay buffer/ glycerol containing 0.25 μg/μL peptide complementary to the affinity tag.\nNote: the presence of 30% glycerol helpsmaintain beads suspension during prolonged elutions.\nCombine the purified RBP with the RNPs at the desired molar ratio in 1x direct assay buffer w/ glycerol.\nNote: both free and bead-bound fractions of RNPs can be used for the reconstitution.\nIncubate at 37°C for 30 min. Proceed to enzymatic assays or icSHAPE pipeline.\nStructural probing of purified RNPs by icSHAPE-seq\nTiming: 6 days\nIn vivo icSHAPE-seq has been described in a step-by-step protocol (Flynn et al., 2016b[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]), by which structural dynamics of the whole RNA transcriptome can be extrapolated from living cells. To gain insights into RBP binding in vivo, deproteinized, in vitro-folded RNA transcriptomes have been compared side-by-side to yield protein-independent, RNA-intrinsic structure profile (Spitale et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib28], Flynn et al., 2016a[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]). However, the icSHAPE reactions inside living cells vs. test tubes are performed with different conditions and substrate complexity, potentially introducing experimental variations. Additionally, reliable extrapolation of full length, base-resolution structural profile of RNA demands sequencing depth and sufficient coverage , which can be challenging for noncoding RNAs and RNPs of low abundance.",
    "To ensure high-quality structural profiling of candidate RNPs, we modified the icSHAPE protocol with the following considerations: firstly, to alleviate the complication related to depth and coverage, we enriched RNPs and RNAs of interest at a sufficient scale. Specifically, low abundant endogenous RNPs were affinity-purified from large-scale cultures of mammalian cells, and the corresponding RNA in naked form was synthesized at a high yield by in vitro transcription. Consequently, natively purified RNPs and their matching naked RNA can be normalized in terms of abundance and buffer condition, and be processed in parallel through the icSHAPE-seq pipeline (see the Graphic Abstract). Thirdly, to pinpoint the structural footprints of a given RBP in an unbiased fashion, the icSHAPE activity of RNPs with or without the RBP can be differentially compared (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). To further validate an observed structural alternation that depends on an RBP, recombinant RBP can be reconstituted at controlled stoichiometry with the RNP (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) or the naked RNA (data not shown). This discovery provides a structural framework to understand TCAB1’s contributions to catalysis and assembly of the telomerase RNP and attests to the unbiased power of icSHAPE in revealing structural dynamics within an RNP.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/620-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Pinpoint the structural footprint of a given RBP by comparing the icSHAPE reactivity of RNPs with or without the RBP\n(A) Raw icSHAPE reactivity, as a probability score (0%–100%), is graphed for RNA residues (298-430) of the telomerase RNA. The Blue track, telomerase RNP purified from WT cells; the Purple track, telomerase RNP purified from RBP-KO cell lines. RBP’s binding site is boxed in Gray.",
    "(B) Tracking the RBP footprint by RBP-KO and biochemical reconstitution. Relative icSHAPE reactivity from various RNP contexts is graphed onto an RNA secondary structure model. The RBP binding site “UGAG” is boxed in gray. Increased reactivity (shown in Red) at the UGAG is attributed to the loss of RBP from the RNP complex; decreased reactivity (shown in Blue) is caused by saturation of the binding site by adding back of excessive recombinant RBP in vitro, which assembled with the RNP purified from RBP-KO cells (RNP w/o RBP). The RBP’s additional distal binding sites at the P6.1 and P6b of telomerase RNA are not shown for simplicity. The differential icSHAPE reactivity profile (−1.0 to 1.0) from each context is derived by subtracting the value of an independent WT-RNP sample. Error bars represent the SD from two technical replicates.\nAs a proof-of-concept, the biochemical reconstitution of TCAB1, a WD40-containing RBP, decreases the icSHAPE signal at the “UGAG” box – terminal loop residues of the telomerase RNA (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]), indicating icSHAPE can accurately capture TCAB1’s footprint at the conserved CAB box important for telomerase localization in cells (Cristofari et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]). Moreover, we revealed TCAB1’s distal structural footprints at P6.1 and P6b, two base-paired stem helices within the three-way-junction of the telomerase RNA. Lastly, structural dynamics specific to the RNP context can be uncovered by comparing and contrasting with the structure of the naked RNA (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]), generated in Preparative steps 10–15.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/620-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Differential icSHAPE profile of RNPs vs. naked RNA distinguishes RNA-intrinsic vs. RNP-specific structural features",
    "Raw icSHAPE reactivity profiles of three RNPs are compared with the naked RNA that is IVT-synthesized and in vitro-folded. Regardless of the RBP status, icSHAPE profiles are similar among RNPs, particularly the high reactivity at the template region (boxed in gray). In comparison, the naked IVT-RNA shows a reactivity profile largely similar to RNPs, except for the template region, showing diminished reactivity instead. This unbiased comparison suggests that the template region of the RNA, upon assembling into the RNP context, undergoes a structural transition from a buried and inaccessible state, to an open, solvent-accessible state, which has implications in substrate binding and RNP catalysis.\nParallel icSHAPE modifications of purified RNPs and IVT-RNA by NAI-N3\nNormalize the molar concentration of complexed RNA and the IVT-RNA by northern blotting.\nEquilibrate WT-RNP, KO-RNP, and RNP + reconstituted RBP, and the IVT-RNA at 37°C for 30 min.\nCritical: for accurate structural comparison, it is important to process relevant samples throughout the icSHAPE pipeline in parallel to minimize variations caused by the batch effect.\nNote: all fractions should be in the same buffer condition, such as in 1x direct assay buffer.\nFor each fraction, divide evenly into 4× reaction tubes.\nTUBE1: NAI-N3-treatment, replicate1\nTUBE2: NAI-N3-treatment, replicate2\nTUBE3: DMSO/mock-treatment, replicate1\nTUBE4: DMSO/mock-treatment, replicate2\nAdd 100 μM of NAI-N3 or an equal volume of DMSO to corresponding reaction tubes, incubate reactions at 37°C for 12 min in a thermomixer at 1000 rpm.\nPause Point: Stop reactions by addition of Trizol LS reagent.\nCritical: the timing and the incubation condition across samples should be handled with precision and consistency.\nPrecipitate total RNAs, and resuspend them in ddH2O.\nResuspend RNAs in 2.5× volume of 100% ethanol, and purify RNAs using an RNA spin column.\nQuantitate the purified RNAs with the Qubit RNA HS assay and agarose gel.",
