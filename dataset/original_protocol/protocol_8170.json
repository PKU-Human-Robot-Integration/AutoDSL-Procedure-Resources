    "All experimental protocols described were approved by the University of Sydney Animal Ethics Committee (approved protocol number: 2018/1308).\n1. Animals\nNOTE: Mice were obtained from the Australian Rodent Centre (ARC; Perth, Australia) and held at the Medical Foundation Building Animal Facility at the University of Sydney.\nMaintain the mice on a normal 12 h light/dark cycle with environmental enrichment.\nUse male and female C57BL/6 mice (3–5 weeks old) for all experiments.\n2. Preparation of Solutions\nPrepare 1 L of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) composed of 29 mM NaHCO3, 11 mM glucose, 120 mM NaCl, 3.3 mM KCl, 1.4 mM NaH2PO4, 2.2 mM MgCl2, 2.77 mM CaCl2.\nPrepare 200 mL of sucrose-ACSF (sACSF) containing 29 mM NaHCO3, 11 mM glucose, 241.5 mM sucrose, 3.3 mM KCl, 1.4 mM NaH2PO4, 2.2 mM MgCl2, 2.77 mM CaCl2. Prior to the inclusion of CaCl2 to the ACSF and sACSF, gas the solutions with carbogen (95 % O2 and 5 % CO2) to establish a pH of 7.4 and avoid calcium precipitation (cloudiness).\nPrepare K+-based intracellular solution composed of 70 mM potassium gluconate, 70 mM KCl, 2 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 4 mM EGTA, 4 mM Mg2-ATP, 0.3 mM Na3-GTP; with a final pH of 7.3 (adjusted using KOH).\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to filter intracellular solutions with 0.22 µm filters and store 0.5 mL aliquots of the solution at -20 °C.\n3. Preparation of the Brainstem\nPrior to brainstem extraction, equilibrate the sACSF with carbogen and cool at -80 °C for 25 min so that an ice slurry is formed.\nAnaesthetize the mouse with isoflurane (3–5 %) saturated in oxygen (3 mL/min). Once the hind paw reflexes are absent, decapitate the mouse with sharp stainless-steel scissors.\nExpose the skull by making a sagittal incision in the skin using a razor blade (#22 rounded).",
    "Using the pointed end of a pair of standard pattern scissors make a small incision at the lambda and cut along the longitudinal fissure.\nCarefully reflect away the paired parietal bones and the occipital bones using a pair of shallow-bend Pearson rongeurs.\nNOTE: During this whole procedure the brain is continuously bathed in situ using the previously prepared ice-cold sACSF slurry.\nIsolate the brainstem from the forebrain and its bony encasing using a razor blade (#11 straight) to cut down the parieto-occipital sulcus and at the caudal medulla.\nMount the isolated brainstem ventral end down on a previously cut trapezoidal polystyrene block. Remove excess fluid around the dissected tissue with a wick of tissue paper to ensure good tissue adhesion to the cutting stage.\nNOTE: The polystyrene block is cut in a trapezoidal shape, to ensure the rostral end of the midbrain fits and tapers into the spinal cord.\nUse cyanoacrylate glue to fix the polystyrene block with the attached brainstem rostral end down to the cutting stage.\nUsing an advance speed of 0.16 mm/s and vibration amplitude of 3.00 mm, prepare 200 µm transverse slices of the MVN.\nNOTE: Location of the MVN is determined using the Paxinos and Franklin mouse brain atlas (Figures 79–89)20. The MVN (listed as MVe in atlas) lies immediately ventrolateral to the 4th ventricle and is largest right before the attachment of the cerebellum (between the inferior colliculi and the obex).\nUse a plastic-trimmed pipette to transfer slices onto a filter paper disc sitting in carbogenated ACSF at 25 °C for at least 30 min prior to recording.\n4. Instruments\nUse a standard electrophysiological setup to perform whole-cell patch clamp techniques21.",
    "Prepare micropipettes using a two-step protocol (heat step 1: 70; heat step 2: 45) on a micropipette puller (see the Table of Materials). Micropipettes should have a final resistance ranging 3–5 MΩ with internal solution when placed in the bath.\nNOTE: Settings used may vary depending on the temperature within room and can change quite frequently.\n5. Whole-cell Patch Clamp Electrophysiology\nTo obtain whole-cell patch clamp recordings from individual neurons in the MVN, a K+-based internal solution is used within the recording pipette.\nTransfer a single tissue slice from the incubation chamber to the recording chamber and secure the slice using a nylon thread on a U-shaped weight. Continuously perfuse the recording chamber with carbogenated-ACSF at 25 °C at a flow rate of 3 mL/min.\nAfter filling a micropipette with internal solution, locate the MVN using a low power (10x) objective lens. Using a high-power (40x) objective, individual neurons within the MVN can be located.\nNOTE: Cell quality is essential in ensuring quality recordings and durability of the cell when attempting to achieve the whole-cell configuration. A good cell will demonstrate spherical shape, a reflective cell membrane and an invisible nucleus. A bad cell will have a large visible nucleus (egg-like) and a swollen/shrunken appearance.\nBefore breaching the tissue with the pipette, apply a small amount of positive pressure to push debris away from the pipette tip.\nMove the pipette using the micromanipulator towards the chosen neuron and a small dimple should form on the neuronal membrane. Release positive pressure and apply a small amount of negative pressure.\nOnce a 1 GΩ seal is achieved, apply gentle short and sharp positive pressure to the pipette holder through the suction port to rupture the membrane and create a whole-cell configuration.\nMake whole-cell current clamp recordings using standard techniques21,22.",
    "6. Applying Sinusoidal and Stochastic Noise to Individual Medial Vestibular Nucleus Neurons\nApply the stochastic and sinusoidal noise at a range of amplitudes from 3 to 24 pA to determine neuronal threshold and firing rate.\nDetermine the sensory threshold by grouping lower and higher stimulus intensities and perform an ANOVA to observe any differences (as shown in Supplementary Figure 1).\nCalculate the average firing rate over the 10 s period where the depolarizing current step was/will be injected for each individual current level (i.e., 7 total episodes; Figure 1).\nUse the average firing rate values to generate a firing rate versus current plot and perform a linear regression analysis to determine the gradient of the line of best fit. The gradient of the line of best fit is indicative of the neuronal gain22.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60044/60044fig1.jpg\nFigure 1: Diagrammatic profiles of control, sinusoidal and stochastic noise protocols. (A) Control (no noise) protocols applied to MVN neurons. (B) Sinusoidal noise protocol with a frequency of 2 Hz. (C) Stochastic noise protocols where majority of the power spectrum is ≤2 Hz. Each protocol presented here has an amplitude of ±6 pA with a 10 s depolarizing current increasing by 10 pA up to 50 pA. The true stimulus does not have a depolarizing current step and is therefore the first episode of these protocols to determine neuronal gain changes.
