    "All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Chicago (Protocol # 72213-09) and performed under sterile conditions.\n1. Preparations\nMake 500 mL of medium for the culture of HCT116 tumor cells: Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin.\nAutoclave the instruments to be used for the spleen injection model, including 3 - 4 surgical towels, gauze, two small Adson pickups, a needle driver, two pairs of scissors, a small clamp, and 3 microclips, at 251 °F for 20 min.\nPrepare postoperative anesthesia for the mice, to be administered subcutaneously following the spleen injection. Dilute 2 - 4 µg of buprenorphine in 500 µL of 0.9 normal saline per mouse.\nPrepare aliquots of 150 µg/150 µL of firefly luciferin for intraperitoneal injections during the bioluminescence assays. Store at -20 °C and protect from light.\n2. Generation of Luciferase/tdTomato-labeled Monoclonal Cell Lines 10,11\nThaw and maintain HCT116 human colorectal cancer cells and 293FT human embryonic kidney cells in DMEM with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. Maintain in culture at 5% CO2 and 37 °C.\nProduce a high-titer lentivirus.\n\t\nOn D 1, plate 10 - 12 x 106 293FT cells between passage 3 and 10 in 15 cm cell culture dishes in 18 mL of complete DMEM (cDMEM) with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids. Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nOn D 2, transfect the cells using the following transfection solution:",
    "For each dish, use the following: a DNA mixture of 37.5 µg of pFUG lentiviral vector inserted with the luciferase (Luc2) and tdTomato constructs11 (a gift from Dr. Geoffrey Greene at the University of Chicago), 25 µg of pCMVΔ8.74, and 12.5 µg of pMD2.G resuspended in a total of 1,062 µL of sterile H2O. Add 188 µL of 2 M CaCl2.\nAdd 1,250 µL of 2x Hepes-buffered Saline (HBS, 50 mM Hepes, 1.5 mM Na2HPO4, and 180 mM NaCl, pH 7.12) to the DNA/CaCl2 solution, a drop at a time, while blowing bubbles through the solution with a pipette.\nIncubate at RT for 20 min, and then add 15.5 mL of RT cDMEM and chloroquine to make a final concentration of 25 µM.\nAspirate the media in each dish of 293FT cells and replace with the transfection solution. Add 16 mL of the transfection solution slowly, as the plated cells easily dislodge.\nOn D 3, after 8 - 16 h, remove the transfection solution and wash the cells once with Dulbecco's Phosphate-buffered Saline (DPBS), again taking care not to dislodge the cells. Replace the media with 18 mL of fresh cDMEM with 10 mM Hepes.\n\t\tNOTE: Slowly move dishes, aspirate the transfection solution, and add the media through the sidewall of plates so as not to dislodge the cells.\nOn D 4, at 48 h from the time of transfection, collect the media from the dishes by aspirating slowly with a pipette so as not to dislodge the cells. Centrifuge the collected media at 300 x g for 5 min to precipitate the large cell debris.",
    "Filter the viral supernatant using a 0.45 µm low-protein-binding filter flask and centrifuge using a SW-28 rotor for 2 h at 50,000 x g and 4 °C. Decant the supernatant immediately after the centrifugation finishes and dry the inside of the tube with wipers.\nResuspend the viral pellet in 50 µL of Reduced Serum Medium (RSM) with 1% FBS. Aliquots can be stored at -80 °C for future use (viral stock).\nTransduce the lentiviruses into the HCT116 cells and generate a panel of tdTomato-positive clones.\n\t\nPlate the HCT116 cells at a density of 1 x 105 in 24 well plates 1 d before the viral infection.\nDilute 40 µL of resuspended virus (from 2.2.7) in 4 mL of RSM (1:100 dilution) with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 8 µg/mL polybrene (cRSM).\nOn the day of infection, wash the cells once with DPBS, and then add 250 µL of diluted virus from step 2.3.2 to each well. Incubate for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, and then add 1 mL of cDMEM to each well; incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 48 - 72 h.\nResuspend the cells with 1 mL of 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mM EDTA, and then add 1 mL of cDMEM to neutralize the trypsin. Transfer the cells to a microcentrifuge tube and pellet at 300 x g for 4 min. Wash the pellet 3x in 1 mL of Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) plus 2% FBS.\nResuspend the pellet from step 2.3.4 with FACS buffer (2% FBCS and 2 mM EDTA in PBS) into a single-cell suspension at 1 x 106 cells/mL.",
    "Sort the tdTomato-positive HCT116 cells using a cell sorter, gating for PE-positive cells (excitation/emission: 556/585 nm). Grow the collected cells in a 10-cm dish at 5% CO2 and 37 °C to generate parental tdTomato-positive HCT116 cells (Figure 1A).\nResuspend the parental tdTomato-positive HCT116 cells from 2.3.6 with 8 mL of 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mM EDTA for 3 - 5 min, and then add 8 mL of cDMEM to neutralize the trypsin.\n\t\t\nTransfer the cells to a 50 mL tube and pellet at 300 x g for 4 min. Remove the supernatant and dilute the parental tdTomato-positive HCT116 cells to 1 cell per 200 µL in cDMEM (Figure 1B).\nPlate a single cell (200 µL of the dilution) per well in a 96-well plate at 5% CO2 and 37 °C (Figure 1C).\nGrow individual monoclones in flasks at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. (Figure 1D).\n3. Calibration of Fluorescent Signal Intensity as a Function of Cell Number\nPlate the transfected HCT116 cells, now referred to as HCT116-L2T, at a density of 0, 103, 2 x 104, 3 x 105, 5 x 104, 7 x 104, 9 x 104, and 105 cells/well in 96 well plates in triplicates for each density.\nAfter 5 h of incubation, quantify the tdTomato fluorescent intensities using IVIS10.\n\t\nClick on the image software icon on the desktop to start the software. Click the \"Initialize\" button to initialize the imaging system. After initialization finishes (which takes about few min), select \"Fluorescence\", \"4 second\" exposure time, \"Medium\" binning, \"2\" F/stop, \"535\" excitation filter, and \"580\" emission filter.\nPlace the 96 well plate on the imaging station and click on \"Acquire\" to start imaging. After the image is acquired, click \"ROI Tools\" in the tool palette and select 12 x 8 from the slit icon.",
    "Create 12 x 8 slits to cover the area of signal on the image of the 96 well plate and click the measurements tab. Observe a window with a table of ROI measurements with units of photons per s per steradian per square cm (photons/s/sr/cm2).\nConstruct a scatterplot with the argument (X axis) equal to the number of cells and the function (Y axis) representing signal intensity. Calculate regression curves using a data analysis software to calculate the amount of cells corresponding to the unit of fluorescent intensity (Figure 2)10.\n4. Animal Model of Liver Metastases\nOnce the HCT116-L2T cells reach 70 - 80% confluency, prepare them approximately 1 h prior to the spleen injection. Dissociate the cells using 0.05% Trypsin in 0.53 mM EDTA for 3 - 5 min, and then neutralize them with an equal amount of cDMEM. Make sure to pipette thoroughly to avoid clumping.\nCount the cells with an automatic cell counter.\nResuspend the cells in 1x DPBS to a concentration of 1.2 - 2 x 106 cells/100 µL. Make sure to pipette and resuspend the cells thoroughly to avoid clumping.\nKeep the cells on ice until injection, occasionally resuspending them in the tube.\nPrior to anesthetizing the mice, provide a preoperative anesthetic and fluid bolus by subcutaneously injecting 500 µL of the buprenorphine mixture described in step 1.3. Administer the same dose of additional buprenorphine mixture twice a day until signs of pain(reduced mobility, hunched stature, failure to groom, vocalization when handled) have resolved.",
    "Anesthetize 6- to 8-week-old female athymic nude mice with 2% isoflurane in oxygen in an anesthesia chamber. Confirm that the mice are completely under anesthesia by pinching the tail. Use vet ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia. Transfer each anesthetized mouse to an individual nose cone for the spleen injection. Prior to incision, each mouse should be covered with a sterile surgical drape.\nIdentify the spleen as a purple area seen externally through the skin on the left flank of the nude mice. Using microdissection scissors, make an 8 mm left flank incision on the skin just above the spleen.\n\t\nNext, lift up on the abdominal wall and make a small incision. Allow air into the abdominal cavity so that the internal organs move away from the incision site. Enlarge the abdominal wall incision to approximately 5 mm.\nExpose the spleen by gently applying pressure around the incision with a cotton swab. If needed, the pancreatic fat can be gently manipulated to help with exposure so as not to injure the spleen.\nSlowly inject 100 µL of cells using a 1 mL syringe with a 27 G needle into the tip of the exposed spleen. Inject slowly, over a period of at least 30 - 60 s, to avoid extra-liver tumors.\nPlace a microclip on the spleen prior to removing the needle at the end of the injection to prevent leakage of the injected cell suspension.\nLeave the microclip in place for 5 min.\n5 min postinjection, perform a splenectomy using a hand-held cautery device for hemostasis. Dissect the splenic hilum, starting from the anterior side. When dissecting large vessels, pre-coagulate the proximal side of the vessels with adjacent fat tissue, using cautery to avoid excessive bleeding.",
    "NOTE: Methods for hemostasis: coagulate the bleeding point directly with cautery, apply pressure to the bleeding point for 3 - 5 min, or suture-ligate the bleeding point with a 5-0 silk tie.\nClose the flank incision of each mouse in two layers. First, close the abdominal wall with a 5-0 absorbable braided suture (e.g., vicryl) in a single horizontal stitch. Next, close the skin using a 4-0 nonabsorbable monofilament suture (e.g., prolene), again with a single horizontal stitch.\nClean all instruments by spraying 70% isopropanol to maintain sterile conditions between every procedure.\n\tNOTE: Make sure the animals are warmed while they awake from anesthesia. Monitor all mice post-operatively until they become ambulatory and return to normal activity. Typically, the recovery time is approximately 3 - 5 min. Do not leave animals unattended until they have regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until it has fully recovered.\n5. In Vivo  Bioluminescent Imaging\nPerform imaging on a weekly basis to measure and quantify changes in bioluminescence over time.\nPlace mice in an anesthesia chamber and anesthetize them with 2% isoflurane in oxygen. Confirm that the mice are completely under anesthesia by pinching the tails. Use vet ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nNext, intraperitoneally inject each mouse with 150 µL of the preprepared firefly luciferin from step 1.4.\nPlace the mice in an IVIS with individual nose cones administering isoflurane. Place the mice in the supine position with spacers in between to minimize the signal to adjacent mice. A maximum of five mice may be imaged at one time.\nMeasure and analyze bioluminescent intensities 3 min after luciferin injection.",
    "After initializing the IVIS as described in step 3.2.1, select \"Luminescent\", \"1 second\" exposure time, and \"Medium\" binning.\nClick the \"Acquire\" button to start imaging. Make sure to perform each imaging at a consistent time (3 min) after the luciferin injection.\nAfter the image is acquired, an image window and tool palette will appear. Click \"ROI Tools\" and select \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"4\", or \"5\" from the circle icon, corresponding to the number of mice imaged.\nTo define Regions of Interest (ROIs), circle the signal area of the luminescent signal in the abdominal cavity of the mouse, and then click \"measurements\" of the ROI as an arbitrary unit of radiant efficiency ((photons/s/cm2/steradian)/(µW/cm2)). Make sure to have an additional ROI circle of the background.\nAt four weeks post-injection and prior to animal sacrifice, perform Diffuse Luminescent Imaging Tomography (DLIT) using IVIS to evaluate the tumor burden and distribution using real-time 3D reconstruction of bioluminescent intensities of individual tumor colonies.\n\t\nAnesthetize the mice and inject luciferin, as described in step 5.2.4. DLIT is performed on one mouse at a time.\nAfter initializing the IVIS, as described in step 3.2.1, select \"Imaging wizard\", \"Bioluminescence\", and click \"Next\". Select \"DLIT\" and click \"Next\". Select \"Firefly\" probes and click \"Next\". Select \"mouse\" image subject, \"Auto\" exposure parameter, \"C-13 cm\" field of view, and \"0.5 cm\" subject height, and click \"Next\". Click the \"Acquire\" button to start imaging.\nAfter the image is acquired, select the \"DLIT 3D Reconstruction\" tab and the \"Analyze\" tab and click \"Reconstruct\" to generate the 3D reconstruction image.\nClick \"Tools\" and \"3D Animation\". Select \"Spin CCW on Y-axis\" in the 3D animation window. Click \"Record\" and \"Save\" into a .mov format file.\n6. Ex Vivo Fluorescent Imaging",
    "Sacrifice the mice by cervical dislocation while anesthetized, or according to institutional guidelines at 4 - 6 weeks following the spleen injections.\nHarvest the liver. Make a horizontal incision from the left to right flank. Grabbing the xiphoid process with a pickup, dissect the falciform, the hepatic vein, and the inferior vena cava.\n\t\nDissect the right hepatorenal ligament, the hepatoduodenal ligament, and the left hepatorenal ligament, taking care not to injure the caudate lobe while dissecting the hepatoduodenal ligament. After harvesting the liver, remove the gallbladder, as this will display autofluorescence. Make note of any additional extra-liver tumors present.\nTake note of the numbers and sizes of liver tumors present macroscopically, and place the harvested livers in DPBS.\n\tNOTE: Tumors are macroscopically visible to the naked eye as white tumors (for a representative example, see Figure 4).\nPrior to placement on the imaging sheet, take each liver and gently remove excess liquid by blotting on a paper towel.\nMeasure the fluorescent intensities from each tumor colony using the IVIS.\n\t\nSelect \"Fluorescence\", \"4 seconds\" exposure time, \"Medium\" binning, \"2\" F/stop, \"535\" excitation filter, and \"580\" emission filter. Click the \"Acquire\" button to start imaging.\nAfter acquiring the image, locate the image window and tool palette. Click \"ROI Tools\" and select \"1\" from the circle icon. To define ROIs, circle the signal area of individual tumor colonies on the image, and then click \"measurements\" of the ROI as an arbitrary unit of radiant efficiency ((photons/s/cm2/steradian)/(µW/cm2)). Make sure to have an additional ROI circle of the background.",
    "Calculate the total tumor volume by assuming it to be a sphere. Tumor volume = 4 x π x r3 / 3 (r = radius). Calculate the fraction of tumor colony forming cells (Fc) as the number of tumors in the liver divided by the number of cells splenically injected.\nCalculate the total cell number per colony (=X) from the linear approximation from step 3.3. Calculate the number of cell divisions (=Y) as Y = log2X and the Td as Td (day) = 28 / Y.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
