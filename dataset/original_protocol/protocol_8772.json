    "1. Preparation for Tissue Collection (15 – 30 min)\nFire polish three sets of glass Pasteur pipettes in decreasing diameters and number them “1” = approximately 1 mm diameter, “2” = approximately 0.75 mm diameter, and “3” = approximately 0.50 mm diameter.\nResuspend lyophilized Enzyme A with all of Buffer A according to the protocol provided with the Neural Dissociation Kit (see Table of Materials). Do not vortex. Aliquot the solution into 50 µl aliquots and store at -20 ºC for later use.\nMake 1 L of myelin removal buffer and vacuum filter for sterilization [myelin removal buffer = 1,000 ml of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 2 ml of 500 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and 10 g of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA)].\nCut nylon mesh sheet into small 1  x 1 inch (2.5 x 2.5 cm) squares that will be used for filtering cellular debris and autoclave in a small beaker covered with aluminum foil.\nPrepare 1 L of wash buffer [wash buffer = 1,000 ml of 0.1 M PBS, 2 ml of 500 mM EDTA, and 10 g BSA].\n2. Tissue Collection\nTurn on water bath to 37 ºC.\nPrepare Buffer X from the Neural Dissociation Kit by adding beta-mercaptoethanol to Buffer X to a final concentration of 0.067 mM (for 4 samples, add 13.5 µl of 50 mM beta-mercaptoethanol to 10 ml of Buffer X).\nPrepare Enzyme Mix 1 by mixing 50 µl of Enzyme P with 1,900 µl of Buffer X for each sample as described in the protocol for the Neural Dissociation Kit For Example, for 4 samples, mix 200 µl of Enzyme P with 7,600 µl of Buffer X.\nPlace Buffer X in the water bath at 37 ºC.",
    "Place 2 ml of cold Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution (HBSS) (without Ca++ and Mg++) into one well of a sterile 6-well culture plate for each sample that will be collected and keep on ice for tissue dissection.\n3. Tissue Dissection (45 min – 1 hr)\nInject the animal with appropriate volume of euthanasia solution (commercial barbiturate solution, e.g., Euthasol), according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) guidelines, and perfuse out all blood with cold 0.9% saline solution.\n\t\nAdminister Rats with an overdose of euthanasia solution.\nMonitor anesthesia via breathing and via toe-pinch. When the animal is sufficiently anesthetized (no response to the toe-pinch and deep, slow breathing), the rat can be perfused.\nTo perfuse the rat, cut the chest cavity open with a pair of heavy-duty scissors. Cut the diaphragm to allow access up to the heart. Cut the ribs along both sides up to towards the top of the chest, to allow full access to the heart. At that point, the rib cage can be held off to the side using a pair of hemostats.\nPerform cardiac perfusion by inserting an 18 G needle (for adult rats) attached to an electric pump into the left ventricle of the heart. The pump is drawing up cold 0.9% saline solution.\nThen cut open the right atrium with a small pair of scissors to allow for the blood and liquid perfusate to drain from the body.\nPerfuse rats with approximately 10 ml (for adult rats) of 0.9% saline to remove all peripheral immune cells and factors.\nDissect the desired part of the brain region using sterile razor blades and appropriate dissection, then place the tissue pieces into the cold HBSS without Ca2+ and Mg2+.",
    "NOTE: The protocol requires HBSS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ in the early steps of the protocol as these ions may interfere with the enzymes required for neural dissociation.\nAfter all tissue samples have been collected, return to the clean bench or sterile culture hood for tissue processing.\n4. Neural Dissociation (1 hr)\nDice each tissue sample into small pieces using sterile razor blades on the lid of the 6-well culture plate. This protocol has been used for tissue samples of approximately 30 - 100 mg, but is approved for tissue samples of up to 400 mg. For tissue samples larger than 400 mg, the reagent volumes must be scaled up appropriately.\nUse 1 ml of fresh HBSS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ to transfer the diced pieces of tissue with a pipette into a sterile 2 ml centrifuge tube. Repeat steps 4.1 and 4.2 for all sample until all samples have been transferred into a 2ml centrifuge tube.\nCentrifuge the samples at 300 x g for 2 min at RT and aspirate supernatant.\nAdd 1,900 µl of warm Enzyme Mix 1, as prepared in Steps 2.2 and 2.3, to each sample and close the tubes.\nIncubate the samples for 15 min in the 37 ºC water bath, inverting the tubes several times every 5 min to re-suspend the settled pieces of tissue.\nMeanwhile, prepare Enzyme Mix 2 by mixing 20 µl of Buffer Y with 10 µl of thawed Enzyme A (for 4 samples, mix 80 µl of Buffer Y with 40 µl of thawed Enzyme A).\nAdd 30 µl of Enzyme Mix 2 to each sample and invert gently. Do not vortex.\nDissociate each tissue sample with Pasteur pipette “1”, triturating up and down 30 times.",
    "Incubate the samples for 15 min in the 37 ºC water bath; invert the tubes several times every 5 min to re-suspend the settled pieces of tissue.\nDissociate each tissue sample with Pasteur pipette “2”, triturating up and down 30 times. Avoid generating bubbles.\nDissociate each tissue sample with Pasteur pipette “3”, triturating up and down 30 times. Avoid generating bubbles.\nIncubate the samples for 10 min in the 37 ºC water bath; invert the tubes several times every 5 min to re-suspend the settled cells.\nApply single-cell suspension to an 80 micron cell strain placed on top of a 15 ml falcon tube to remove any large pieces of debris and wash the filter and cells with 10 ml of HBSS (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) to stop the enzyme reactions. Repeat until each sample is transferred into a clean 15 ml falcon tube.\nCentrifuge the samples at 300 x g for 10 min at RT and aspirate off the supernatant.\n5. Myelin Depletion (45 min)\nThoroughly re-suspend the pellet of cells with 400 µl of myelin removal buffer.\nAdd specified amount of the myelin removal beads and pipette up and down to thoroughly mix.\n\tNOTE: The volume of myelin removal beads that is used will depend upon the size of the tissue, the age of the animal, and the amount of myelin expected in that particular brain region. e.g., for an adult rat hippocampus sample (approximately 300 mg), incubate the sample with 100 µl of myelin removal beads.\n\t\n\t\nIncubate for 15 min in the refrigerator at 4 ºC.\nWash each sample with 5 ml of myelin removal buffer.\nCentrifuge the samples at 300 x g for 10 min at RT.",
    "While centrifuging the samples, place 1 column for each sample in the magnetic field of the magnetic sorter and place a clean 80 micron filter on top of each column.\nPrepare the columns and filter by rinsing each column with 1 ml of myelin removal buffer, 3 times (3 ml total). Collect all flow-through in a waste container such as the bottom of an empty tip box.\nPosition 5 ml polystyrene round bottom tube directly underneath each column in preparation of sample collection.\nWhen cells have finished centrifugation, aspirate supernatant and thoroughly re-suspend in 500 µl of myelin removal buffer. Immediately apply cell suspension to the column and collect the cells in the tube below.\nWash the filter and column with 1 ml myelin removal buffer, 4 times (4 ml total).\nCentrifuge the cell collection at 300 x g for 10 min at RT.\nAspirate the supernatant and the cells are now ready for staining.\n6. Staining Live Cells for FACS (1 hr for staining)\nBriefly vortex (2 sec) the cells to separate the pellet and immediately add 5 µl of Fc block (anti- clusters of differentiation 32, CD32), vortex again, and incubate in the refrigerator at 4 ºC for 5 min.\nMeanwhile, prepare the primary antibody mixture by adding the three primary antibodies in wash buffer as follows: 0.125 µl of allophycocyanin (APC) -conjugated CD11b antibody (1:800), 1 µl of anti-GLT1 antibody (1:100), and 0.4 µl of Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) – conjugated Thy1 antibody (1:250) for every 100 µl of wash buffer. Each sample will receive 100 µl of primary antibody mixture for incubation; however, if your sample is much larger than 400 mg of tissue, you may want to consider increasing the volume of your primary antibody mixture accordingly",
    "Prepare tubes for single staining controls by removing just 2 µl of cells from each sample tube and adding it to each single stain control tube. The “single stain” controls include: APC-CD11b only, GLT1 only, FITC-Thy1 only, PE secondary antibody only, and the “blank” or unstained control.\n\tNOTE: All samples should be represented in all staining controls, thus 2 µl of cells from each sample should be added to each staining control tube.\nBriefly vortex the tubes (2 sec) and add 100 µl of primary antibody mixture to each sample tube and 100 µl of appropriate primary antibody to each staining control tube, vortex the tubes again, cover the tubes with aluminum foil to protect the fluorescent antibodies from any light, and incubate the tubes in the refrigerator at 4 ºC for 20 min. The samples should be kept cool (at 4 ºC) for the remainder of the procedure to maintain the integrity of the samples and the antibodies.\nBriefly vortex the tubes and add 2 ml of wash buffer to each tube.\nCentrifuge tubes at 350 x g for 5 min at 4 ºC.\nMeanwhile, prepare the secondary antibody mixture by adding 0.2 µl of PE-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody for every 100 µl of wash buffer. Each sample will get 100 µl of secondary antibody mixture; however, if your sample is much larger than 400 mg of tissue, you may want to consider increasing the volume of your primary antibody mixture accordingly.\nWhen the centrifugation is complete, dump the supernatant off of each sample into the sink and blot the tubes upside-down on a paper towel.",
    "Briefly vortex the tubes and add 100 µl of secondary antibody mixture to each sample tube and the appropriate secondary antibody to each staining control, vortex the tubes again, cover the tubes with aluminum foil, and incubate the tubes in the refrigerator at 4 ºC for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: The GLT1-only staining control tube should get the secondary antibody mixture.\n\t\n\t\nAfter the incubation, briefly vortex the tubes and add 2 ml of wash buffer to each tube.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 350 x g for 5 min at 4 ºC.\nWhen the centrifugation is complete, dump the supernatant off of each sample into the sink and blot the tubes upside-down on a paper towel.\nVortex the tubes and add 0.25 ml of sterile PBS to each tube. The samples are ready for sorting.\n\tNOTE: More cells may require 0.5 ml of sterile PBS; however it is best to begin with a lower volume as the sample can always be diluted if it is too concentrated with cells.\n\tNOTE: Optionally add DNase to the tube to prevent clumping of the cells and thus clogging of the sorter. Samples can also be filtered using a sterile 80 micron filter just prior to sorting in order to avoid clogging the sorter.\n\t\n\t\nTake cells to the sorter on ice. Collect the cell populations in 2 ml nuclease-free centrifuge tubes with 0.5 ml of sterile PBS in each tube.\nAfter the sort, spin the cells down at 300 x g for 2 min at 4 ºC. Aspirate off most of the PBS and flash freeze the cells in the -80 ºC freezer until further processing for either RNA extraction (see 1 for further protocol details), DNA extraction (see 2 for further protocol details) or cell lysis for protein analysis.",
