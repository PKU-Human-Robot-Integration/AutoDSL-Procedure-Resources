  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: All procedures performed here were submitted to and approved by IACUC (Office of Research Compliance) and were conducted following NIH guidelines. Mice used in the behavioral testing paradigm were naive and not used for other tests. The C57BL/6 Wild Type and Knock Out mice used in this protocol have been described previously9 and the data presented here are from that manuscript.\n1. Preparation of the Testing Room and Open Field Apparatus\nUse a multiple unit open field maze (OFM) consisting of four activity chambers was used for this analysis (Figure 1). Each chamber measured 50 cm (length) x 50 cm (width) x 38 cm (height) and was made from white high density and non-porous plastic.\nTexture the floors of the maze for traction during ambulation while maze walls were smooth. Maze quadrants were completely empty for the purpose of this test. In consideration of the rest of this protocol, a single quadrant of the maze described above will be utilized to demonstrate the OFM.\nWipe the chamber with a 95% Ethanol prior to use and before subsequent tests to remove any scent clues left by the previous subject mouse.\nAllow the ethanol to evaporate completely prior to testing mice. This may take 5-10 min between each testing session.\nFor this analysis, use the SMART Video Tracking software from PanLab/Harvard Apparatus to record and evaluate mouse movement.\n\tNOTE: Any commercial video tracking camera and software may be used to track the test subject and evaluate results from the open field maze. It is very important for the end user to understand how to calibrate and run the software used for each individual analysis. Regardless of the video camera and tracking software used, best results are obtained when the camera and software are correctly calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "Perform the testing in a standard lit room capable of containing the maze apparatus and the computer required to run the software. Suspend the video camera above the maze either by attaching it to the ceiling or by using any elevated support system which allows the camera lens to see the entire maze area (Figure 2).\nAs the human administrator of the test, be sure to have enough space in the room to be completely unobservable by the test subjects in the maze so as not to influence behavior of the mice.\n2. Preparing the Software to Measure Activity\nOpen the Video Tracking software.\nOnce the software is opened, move the cursor to the “Single-subject tracking” option located under the “Data Acquisition” tab and single click to open this option.\nChoose the “Static Background” option located at the bottom of the screen.\nAfter choosing “Static Background” is chosen, it is necessary to use the software to take an image of the maze prior to addition of the test subjects. To do this, move the cursor to the “Photo” button located at the bottom of the screen and single click.\n\tNOTE: The software will take a picture of the scenario without the test subject which will be subtracted from the image taken during the tracking process. This results in only the movement of the subject being analyzed by the software.",
    "Confirm that the background image taken above is completely removed by the tracking software by moving the cursor to the “Test” button located at the bottom of the screen and clicking once. A solid white field will be shown if the background image is completely removed from the tracking image. If lighting conditions change or the maze is accidentally moved, you will see black “shadows” in this field indicating the two images do not perfectly coincide. To remedy this situation, simply repeat step 2.4 above.\nAfter confirming background settings, use the Timing option to configure the way time is controlled during acquisition. To do this, move the cursor to the “Configuration” tab and click once on the “Timings” heading. Use the newly opened window to enter experimental parameters.\nFor this protocol, chose the “Programmed time” option as 10 min tracking period. Set the “Latency period” to 5 sec to allow the user time to place the mouse in the center of the maze and move away prior to initiation of tracking. Enter the “Acquisition time” of 10 min for the duration of the test. Set the “Stop control” set to “When programmed time (10 min) is over” which will automatically turn off the camera and the tracking function of the software.\nMove the cursor to the “Close” button after all timings have been set to close the window. You are now ready to begin the testing procedure.\n3. Administration of the Open Field Test",
    "NOTE: The software package used in this protocol allows the tracking of up to 16 individual mice at one time. For ease of completion and as mentioned above, the protocol discussed here is for a single mouse using a single quadrant of the OFM. For the equipment in use for this protocol, a maximum of 4 individual mice could be tracked using each quadrant of the maze. If utilizing a multi-enclosure maze, after placing the first subject mouse in its defined quadrant, place the remaining mice into their respective maze quadrant for tracking analysis. For the purposes of this protocol, further instruction will be specific to a single quadrant of the maze.\nBring the mice in their home cages from their housing room into the testing room. Allow the mice to acclimate to the procedure room for a minimum of 30 min prior to starting the test.\nRemove a single mouse from the home cage by gently grasping its tail and place the mouse in the middle of the open field maze while concurrently activating the SMART software by single clicking on the Start button to begin tracking mouse movement. It is normal for the mouse to move immediately to the periphery walls of the maze and the timing of release and tracking capture of the mouse should coincide to record this movement.\nAllow free and uninterrupted movement of the subject mouse throughout the respective quadrant of the maze for a single 10 min period during which time, the tracking software will record movement (Figure 3).\nAt the end of the test period, pick up the subject mouse gently, removing it from the maze and return it to its home cage.",
    "Prior to cleaning the maze, visually count the fecal boli pellets present in the maze and manually record the numbers for further analysis.\nRemove all fecal pellets and wipe up all spots of urination. Spray the floor and walls of the maze quadrant with 95% ethanol and wipe down with a clean paper towel. Allow the ethanol solution to completely dry prior to testing other mice.\nRepeat the procedure with the next mouse.\n4. Measurement and Analysis of Behavior During Testing Procedure\nNOTE: For measurement, three aspects of open field behavior are readily characterized using this protocol (see discussion). A brief instruction on how to access these measurements in the video tracking software follows.\nFrom the main screen of the SMART software, move the cursor to the “Zones” tab and single click “Definition” to open the Zone Editor.\nFollow the detailed instructions in the SMART software User’s Manual do define zones or grids to overlay on the tracking paths. Here, the software was used to define a 5 x 5 grid of 10 cm squares covering the floor of the maze (Figure 4). Be sure to save the zone file created prior to closing the Zone Editor.\nFrom the main screen of the SMART software, move the cursor to the “Analysis” tab and single click to open the Data Analysis window.\nMove the cursor to the “File” tab and open the Zone file created above.\nMove the cursor to the “Configuration” tab and open the “Track Analysis” option. This will open the “Single-subject analysis configuration” window.\n\t\nMove the cursor to the “Standard” tab and move the “Travelled distance” parameter from the Available Parameters box (left side) to the Included Parameters box (right side).",
    "Move the cursor to the “Zones Transitions” tab and move all appropriate parameters to the Included Parameters box as above.\nMake sure the “Full Track” box is checked at the bottom of the window.\nMove the cursor to the OK button and close the Single-subject analysis configuration window.\n\t\tNOTE: Depending on the analysis you wish to perform, many other options can be chosen in this window to mine data from the analysis. Read the detailed User’s Manual of your specific program to determine what parameters are most important for analysis of your data.\nUnder the File tab at the upper left of the program window, open the Single subject track window and place a check mark beside all tracks being analyzed. Move the cursor to the Check Mark button at the top of the window and click to close the Track Explorer window.\nMove the cursor to the “Go” button in the Data Analysis window and single click to initiate analysis of the track data.\nAnalysis data can be output as either ASCII text files or it can be directly exported into an EXCEL spreadsheet. Use the output tools of the software program you are using to output the data for your own use.",
    "NOTE: Total distance traveled and time spent in indicated zones will be output following the data analysis steps outlined above. Again, it is stressed that the steps to reach these measurements represented here will differ depending on the user software used. But the data itself and the interpretation of the results should be similar independent of the software program used. It is also worth noting that test administrator bias is removed from this protocol as all the data collected is quantified data measured by the software and not the administrator. Thus there is no qualifiable element to the data collected as described.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
