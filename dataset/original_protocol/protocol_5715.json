    "Setting up the PhenoMaster TSE systemMeasure body weight of each mouse that will be used for the experiment.Note: Age of mice was matched to eliminate the confounding effect of age on energy expenditure and food intake and to minimize the body weight difference between mice. At the beginning of the experiment, mouse body weight ranged between 20 g and 30 g. It is important to use mice with similar body composition to minimize errors during data analysis when body weight is used to normalize energy expenditure and food intake. Open LabMaster and calibrate gas sensors for O2 and CO2, and weight scales for food and water according to manufacturer’s manual. It is not necessary to turn on the system before calibration.Turn on climate chambers and set the temperature at 23 °C (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180416/20180416034723_6855.jpgFigure 1. The PhenoMaster TSE system. One climate chamber can harbor 6 boxes that can measure O2, CO2, food intake, water consumption.Transfer mice to housing boxes (1 mouse/box; Figure 2) and securely seal lids using 2 latches per cage (one front and one back; Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180416/20180416034837_4567.jpgFigure 2. A mouse housing box for the PhenoMaster TSE system. Each box is equipped with tubing for gas in and out, weight sensors for water and food, and an infrared light beam frame for locomotor activity.Fill water bottles with tap water and food hoppers with regular chow, and hang them at corresponding weight sensors. It is important to check each water bottle and food hopper for good water flow and accessibility of food pellets, respectively. Under the ‘Setup’ tab in LabMaster, input animal IDs, body weight, and set up other parameters such as a measurement interval. In our experiment, the measurement interval was 25 min.Under the ‘Measurement’ tab, select ‘Start’ to begin measurements.",
    "Daily injections and body weight measurementNotes: The room had a 12:12 light:dark cycle with the light on at 7 AM and off at 7 PM.Whenever opening a box to measure body weight, refill water or food, or perform injections, it is important not to open the lid while the system is measuring that specific box to prevent outside air from coming into the box. It is safest to open the lid of a box right after the system has just finished measuring that box. Select ‘Status > Calo’ in LabMaster to identify the box the system is actively measuring. Before opening the box, select ‘Status > Trial Monitor Drink/Feed’ in LabMaster to open the box monitoring screen (Figure 3). Right click on the green circle underneath a box number, and then select ‘Pause Box’ to temporarily pause measurements of that box (Figure 3). The circle turns yellow. Once the box lid is back on and sealed, right click the same circle and select ‘Continue Box’ to resume measurements (Figure 4). Once a week during the experiment, replace dirty mouse box bottoms with clean ones and refill water bottles with fresh water.When an accident happens, such as opening of a box while the system is reading the same box, data from that time point for that box should not be used for later analysis. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180416/20180416035126_4330.jpgFigure 3. Example image of Trial Monitor Drink/Feed screen. The green circles under box numbers indicate boxes included for measurements. In this example, boxes #12 and #24 are not included in the experiment.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180416/20180416035233_8599.jpgFigure 4. Example image showing how to continue measurements of a temporarily paused boxFor overall experimental scheme, see Figure 5.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180416/20180416035412_5105.jpgFigure 5. Overall experimental scheme.",
    "Mice were first acclimated to a new environment and then injected with 3 days of saline followed by 6 days of CNO. Body weight was measured every morning.Day 1-3: Let mice acclimate to a new environment without any disturbance other than refilling water or food. During this period, if water leaks and floods the bedding, replace the faulty parts (e.g., sipper or entire bottle) and the box bottom.Day 4-15: body weight measured daily at 9 AM for each mouse.Day 4-6: saline IP injection twice daily at 9:30 AM and 6 PM for each mouse. Detemin the amount of saline injection by the body weight of the day, such that it matches the amount of CNO working solution (0.06 mg/ml) that would have been needed for that body weight to achieve the dose of 0.3 mg/kg. For example, 20 g mouse receives 100 μl of saline.Day 7-12: CNO IP injection (0.3 mg/kg) twice daily at 9:30 AM and 6 PM for each mouse. The amount of CNO injection is determined by the body weight of the day as described above.Day 13-15: mice recover from daily injections (no injection).Finishing the experiment and retrieving dataOn day 14 after morning body weight measurement, stop measurements by selecting ‘Measurement > Stop’ in LabMaster.Take out mice and put them in regular housing cages with water and food. To export data, first go to ‘View’ to select parameters and box numbers to export data. Select ‘Export > Table’, then designate file name and location."
