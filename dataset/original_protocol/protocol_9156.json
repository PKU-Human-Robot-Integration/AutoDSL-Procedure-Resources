    "1. Head-restraint Overview\nTo assemble a custom-built head-post, insert a 1/16\" stainless steel roll-pin perpendicularly into a hole drilled in a 3/32\" stainless steel rod to form a cross. The vertical piece of the head-post should be about 20 mm and the horizontal cross piece about 15 mm. Tap one end of the vertical rod to accept a #1-72 screw. (Fig. 1).\nDuring surgery and recording, the head-post is secured in a custom-built brass or aluminum mounting bar with a #1-72 screw (Fig. 2). The long piece of the mounting bar should be about 90 mm long and 5-10 mm wide. The head-post fits into a groove cut into a 15 mm extension off the long bar that is angled at 45 deg. To prevent head rotation, the crosspiece of the head-post nestles into a small groove on the bottom of the mounting bar.\nThe mounting bar in then attached to a custom-made aluminum mounting block (Fig. 3). The mounting block is approximately 30 mm x 30 mm x 25 mm. This mounting block is attached to a micromanipulator so that the position of the head-post can be accurately placed along the midline and at Bregma. The mounting block is made of two pieces fitted together with screws. A cut-out in the block allows the mounting bar to slide in and be secured with the screws. The mounting bar is parallel to the table surface. During recording, secure the bar in a custom stereotaxic frame (Fig. 4). The stereotax is designed to mount the bar in the same position as in the mounting block during surgery. This arrangement ensures that the mouse will always be aligned to the stereotaxic frame across experimental sessions.",
    "Cut a tungsten rod (diameter .010\") to approximately 5 mm length, with approximately 1 mm bent at 45°. This rod serves as the ground pin (Fig. 1).\n2. Stereotaxic Alignment for Craniotomy\nNote: All procedures outlined below follow standard aseptic surgical techniques and have been approved by the Washington State University Animal Care and Use Committee and the Animal Ethics Committee of the Garvan Institute.\nAnesthetize the mouse by placing in an induction chamber with 5% isoflurane. The lack of a reaction to tail and/or toe pinch ensures that the animal is fully anesthetized.\nPlace the mouse in a rodent stereotaxic frame outfitted with a mouse adapter (Stoelting). To orient the mouse correctly, place the teeth inside the hole of the bite bar and tighten the nose clamp so it is snug. Place the mouse as straight as possible in the bite bar and nose clamp. Place a face mask made from a piece of latex glove over the mouse's nose, and keep the isoflurane at 5% until the mouse's respiration rate is approximately 1 breath/sec. Turn the isoflurane to 1.5 - 2.0%. Secure the head using the ear-bars being careful to not puncture the ear drum. Bars should be snug but not penetrating too deeply into the ear canals.\nPlace a heating pad underneath the mouse.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to prevent the eyes from drying out.\nShave the scalp from between the ears up to the eyes with a small shaver or fine-point scissors.\nClean and sterilize the scalp by wiping with chlor-hexidine (or betadine) scrub followed by alcohol rinse repeated 3 times.\nTo remove the skin over the top of the skull make an incision along the midline from the back of the head to the eyes.",
    "Scrape the periosteum to the edges of the incision with a scalpel. If required (depending on experimental target), carefully retract the musculature at the back of the neck with forceps, allowing the muscle to tear along fascicles to minimize bleeding. Apply gelfoam underneath scalp tissue to minimize moisture and prevent the skin from moving over the skull.\nDry the skull surface with a cotton-tipped applicator moistened with isopropyl alcohol to enhance the visualization of skull landmarks.\nAlign the skull to standard stereotaxic coordinates13. Insert a fine-point probe in the electrode holder and attach it to the stereotaxic micromanipulator. A sharpened metal rod works well for this purpose (Fig. 5).\nUse the point to identify Bregma (Fig. 5A) and Lambda (Fig. 5B) on the skull. Move the probe back-and-forth between these points, checking that the lateral-medial coordinate for each location differs by no more than 50 μm. Reposition the head as needed by carefully loosening the ear-bars, shifting the head and ear-bars laterally, and retightening the ear-bars.\nVerify that the dorsal-ventral height at each location differs by no more than 50 μm. Adjust the height of the nose-clamp, which will rotate the skull around the axis of the ear-bars, to level the pitch of the skull if necessary. The height of the ear-bar might also need to be adjusted.\nUse an atlas13 to identify the coordinates of the target of interest (Fig. 5C) relative to Bregma. Mark the skull above the target (e.g., an \"X\" or use India ink to dot four corners of a square) where a craniotomy will be made (Fig. 5D).\n3. Head-post and Ground Pin Installation",
    "Use etch gel to clean skull. Use the applicator to scrub and spread etch gel over the surface (10 sec). Wash with water and dry completely. Apply the primer for dental cement to the skull surface using applicator. Spread adhesive with new applicator. Cure the adhesive with a UV light-gun (1 cycle).\nChoose a location for the ground pin that is distal to the target site. Carefully bore a small hole in the skull using the tip of a #65 miniblade scalpel just wide enough for the short end of the ground pin to enter and rest upon the meninges. The ground pin should be oriented so that it is pointing away from Bregma and the future head-post (Fig. 6A).\nSecure the head-post to the mounting bar and block and attach to the micromanipulator. By moving the micromanipulator in three dimensions, position the head-post over Bregma, just touching the skull (Fig. 6B).The base of the head-post should lie flat on the skull.\nUsing dissection probes, apply a small amount of dental cement around the head-post and ground pin (Fig. 6C). Press the cement down to ensure good contact with the skull. Note: Do not use too much cement or it will not harden evenly. Cure the cement with a UV light-gun (3-4 cycles from multiple angles).\nApply the second stage of cement and build up the base around the head-post and cover the grooves of the head-post (Fig. 6D).\n4. Craniotomy\nLocate the craniotomy reference mark, which will be partially obscured by the primer. Use a #65 scalpel to mark a 3 mm x 3 mm square around this site and apply a drop of lidocaine to reduce sensitivity and to minimize bleeding.",
    "Make multiple scores on each side of the square (as many as 10), being careful not to cut through the bone and into the brain (Fig. 7A).\nOnce the bone flap becomes loose, use the tip of the scalpel to pry it up, leaving the dura mater intact (Fig. 7B).\nCover with bone wax.\n5. Post-surgery\nTurn off gas anesthesia and remove the mouse from the stereotaxic frame.\nUse a cotton-tipped applicator to apply Lidocaine ointment around exposed skin to deaden sensation around wound. Use another cotton-tipped applicator to apply Neosporin to the exposed skin. Inject ketoprofen (5 mg/kg IM or IP based on preference of individual IACUC veterinarians) as a post-surgery analgesic. Mouse will generally be up and moving within minutes of gas cessation.\nPlace mouse in a warm cage and monitor until it is ready to return to animal housing.\nThe animal should be checked on at least once per day after it has recovered from surgery. Watch for signs of poor eating and/or drinking and listless behavior. If pain is suspected, provide ketoprofen every 24 hours (same dose as at the end of post-surgery) until alleviated. Lidocaine can be locally applied to the wound if the animal is scratching or shows signs of discomfort. Animals typically recover from surgery without complications or pain.\n6. Recording and Dye Injection\nWait at least one day after head-post surgery before using the mouse for recordings.\nPlace mouse in a foam-restraining device molded to the mouse's body. The mouse has already been adapted to this device, thereby reducing its anxiety. Typical adaptation is to handle the mouse every day after weaning and for approximately one week prior to surgery and experiments, place the mouse in the foam device for 1-5 minutes. Suspend device in the stereotaxic frame (Fig. 4).",
    "Secure head-post to mounting bar, which is now fixed to the stereotaxic frame (Fig. 4).\nConnect to the ground pin with a wire terminated with a blunt 22-gauge hypodermic needle tip.\nRemove bone wax over the craniotomy. Remove dura if necessary using the tip of a miniblade scalpel.\nDrive electrode to proper stereotaxic location and begin recording (Fig. 8). For only electrophysiological recordings, a variety of electrodes can be used. The choice of electrode is dependent on the location and type of recordings required. The choice of electrode for the awake mouse recordings will be the same as what a researcher uses in an anesthetized mouse. For combined electrophysiological recordings with dye/tracer injections, a micropipette electrode is used10. The micropipette is filled with the dye/tracer of choice so that it can be iontophoretically injected at the end of electrophysiological experiments. Multibarrel electrodes can also be used so that pharmacological manipulations can be made. The multibarrel electrode is mounted onto a single recording micropipette (Fig. 8). These techniques are standard in the literature and are not different for anesthetized versus awake recordings.\nRecordings can be made for 4-5 hours over 3-4 consecutive days.",
    "At the end of the recording session, the dye/tracer can be injected. Because there are no pain receptors in the brain, the iontophoretic injection of the dye or tracer into the brain is unlikely to cause discomfort. However, once the electrophysiological response properties of the region where the injection is to be made are characterized, the animal could be anesthetized with isoflurane for the injection. This would eliminate any potential unwanted sensations. Because the dye/tracer is already in the micropipette, the active and ground leads can be switched from the electrophysiological recording set-up to the current generator to iontophoretically inject the dye/tracer. Use appropriate protocol for the dye/tracer in the electrode. Remove the animal from the headpost restraint and body restraint and return to its home cage.\nAt the end of the experiment, follow appropriate protocol for euthanasia and tissue processing to recover injection site and labeling.\n7. Representative Results",
    "Successful installation of the head-post allows the experimenter to record single and multiunit responses from an unanesthetized, awake mouse over multiple days. The restraint system allows for stable electrophysiological recordings of single neurons in the brain. Excellent isolation of single units and strong responses to stimuli can be recorded from the same brain structure over multiple days, for example in the mouse inferior colliculus (Fig. 9A, day one; Figure 9B, day two). With a good head-post installation, each mouse will be consistently aligned to the stereotaxic apparatus and the mouse stereotaxic atlas,13 resulting in reliable localization of particular brain nuclei. This reliable localization allows for injection of dyes and tracers into specific structures after multiple recording days. For example, to assess descending projections from the auditory midbrain to the auditory brainstem, biotinylated dextran amine (visualized using diaminobenzidine as chromagen) can be injected into the mouse inferior colliculus (Fig. 10A) after electrophysiologically identifying neuronal response properties at the site of injection (in Fig. 10A, a neuron was recorded with a best frequency of 51 kHz), and after tissue processing, anterograde labeling in the contralateral dorsal cochlear nucleus can been visualized and plotted (Fig. 10B). Photomicrographs at higher resolution can also be obtained to view anterogradely labeled axons and terminals (Fig. 10C).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3755/3755fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3755/3755fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3755/3755fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3755/3755fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3755/3755fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3755/3755fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3755/3755fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3755/3755fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3755/3755fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. \nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/3755/3755fig10.jpg\nFigure 10.
