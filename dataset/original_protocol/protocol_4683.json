    "Substrate patterning and cell seedingMicro-contact print circular islands of extracellular matrix protein fibronectin onto 35-mm ibidi’s hydrophobic uncoated μ-dishes to confine cells spreading to an isotropic shape. Circle area of 1,800 μm2 was chosen to ensure cells would spread over the entire island and consistently assemble actin transverse arcs. For a detailed protocol on micro-contact printing see Tee et al. (2015).Culture human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF) in growth medium in an incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in air atmosphere.To dissociate cells, begin by aspirating culture medium, rinse cells once with 1x PBS and then add trypsin solution to culture flask and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C.Resuspend trypsinized cells in growth medium.Transfer cells into a centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 800 x g for 3 min.Remove supernatant, resuspend cell pellet in growth medium and then centrifuge at 800 x g for 3 min.Remove supernatant, resuspend cell pellet in growth medium and then perform cell count.Seed 5 x 104 cells in 1 ml growth medium onto the 35-mm printed dish from step A1.Incubate dish for 10 min at 37 °C for cells attachment onto fibronectin circular islands.Aspirate culture medium and rinse once with 1x PBS to remove unattached cells.Add 1 ml of growth medium and return dish to incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Incubate cells for 5-7 h prior to cell permabilization.Cell permeabilizationAspirate the culture medium from dish.Permeabilize cells by gently adding 1 ml of extraction buffer A.Incubate in extraction buffer A for 10 min at room temperature on bench top.Gently aspirate extraction buffer A.Gently wash permeabilized cells with 2 ml of extraction buffer B.Incubate in extraction buffer B for 1-3 min on bench top.Gently aspirate extraction buffer B. Repeat steps B5-7 three times.",
    "Actin cytoskeleton contractility assayStain actin cytoskeleton in cells in 1 ml of staining solution for 10-30 min at room temperature on bench top in the dark.[Optional step] Image the AlexaFluor-488-phalloidin labeled actin cytoskeleton in staining solution under 100x objective for 10-30 min at 37 °C with a 2 min time interval and a 5-10 μm Z-section (step-size, 0.35 μm). Actin cytoskeleton should remain inactive prior to induction of contractility with ATP.Aspirate staining solution.Add 1 ml of contractility buffer.Image the AlexaFluor-488-phalloidin labeled actin cytoskeleton in cells under 100x objective for 30-60 min at 37 °C with a 2 min time interval and a 5-10 μm Z-section (step-size 0.35 μm).Kymograph analysis using Image JDownload freeware Image J from http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/[href=http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/].Open time-series Z-stack image (XYZT) in Image J. Perform a Z-projection (click Image → Stacks → Z project), and choose Max Intensity to add up the brightest pixels from each frame. Use the time-series maximum intensity projection image for step D3.Draw a line along the region of interest - actin transverse arcs between a pair of radial fibers, using the ‘Straight Line’ tool in Image J. In the example Figure 1, a line is drawn from the cell edge towards the cell center.Use the Image J function “Reslice” (click Image → Stacks → Reslice [/]) to generate a kymograph of the time-series stack for the white line using the settings-output spacing 3 pixels, slice count 1, rotate 90 degrees and avoid interpolation. Briefly, each time point gives an intensity line profile, in y-axis, averaged over a 3-pixel width along the drawn line. These line profiles are stacked side by side along the x-axis for all time points, so we get a single image of a distance over time plot in the y- and x-axis respectively (see Figure 1C).",
    "In the example Figure 1, velocity of the centripetally moving actin transverse arcs can be measured from the slope of the green intensity line (μm min-1) (e.g., in the condition with addition of ATP only). The slope of the line in the kymograph is proportional to velocity. In addition, if the line in the kymograph is parallel to the x-axis (e.g., in the conditions without ATP, with addition of AMP-PNP and addition of ATP together with blebbistatin), this means there is no movement over time."
