    "During all the experiment, time and temperature are critical. All the steps have to be performed at +4°C if not otherwise stated. Pre-cool all the centrifuges and rotors.\nAn overview of the protocol is shown in Figure 1. \n**Preparation of zebrafish embryos extracts**\n1- Collect embryos at the one-cell stage in a 35 mm Petri dish with E3 medium \\(100 embryos per condition at least).\n2- Place the embryos at the expected developmental stage into a pre-chilled dounce glass and add 1 ml of ice-cold MB buffer.\n3- Homogenize for 10 times in ice with a loose-fitting pestle by slowly stroking the pestle up and down until all embryo’s chorions are removed. This step also permits to disrupt the yolk sac of the embryos.\n4- Let the homogenate settle on ice for 10 minutes.\n5- Transfer the homogenate into a pre-chilled 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge at 300 _g_ for 5 min.\n6- An optional additional centrifugation step can be added. Re-spin the supernatant at 300 _g_ for 5 min to pellet any cells left.\n7- Resuspend pellet containing the cells with 1 ml of cold-MB buffer.\n**Isolation of mitochondria**\n8- Disrupt the cells with a 1 mL syringe and a 26 G x 2/3 needle 50 times on ice.\n9- Homogenization can be checked by placing 2 µl on a microscope slide and visualizing cell lysis by phase-contrast microscopy. Few intact cells must be visible, if it is not the case re-disrupt homogenate until all the cells are lysed.\n10- Centrifuge cell lysate twice at 1,500 _g_ for 10 min to eliminate nuclei.\n11- Transfer the supernatant containing mitochondria, cytosol and microsomes into a new pre-chilled 1.5 ml centrifuge tube.\n12- Spin the supernatant twice at 10,600 _g_ for 10 min to pellet mitochondria \\(labeled as mito-I).",
    "13- Remove and store supernatant on ice \\(labeled as ER-I) for endoplasmic reticulum membranes isolation.\n14- Gently resuspend the mito-I pellet with 1 ml of cold MB buffer. \n15- Centrifuge again at 10,600 _g_ for 10 min.\n16- Discard the supernatant and save the pellet as mitochondria.\n17- Gently resuspend mitochondria in 50 µl of cold MB buffer.\n18- Determine the protein concentration of the sample \\(Bradford).\n19- Store at -20°C for further investigations \\(western blot) if not used immediately.\n**Isolation of ER membranes**\n20- Place the ER-I supernatant \\(from step 13) into a pre-chilled ultracentrifuge tube and equilibrate the rotor carefully.\n21- Spin at 100,000 _g_ for 1 hour at +4°C.\n22- The pellet is not visible so carefully discard the supernatant and gently resuspend the pellet containing ER membrane in 50 µl of cold MB buffer.\n23- The amount of microsome proteins is determined \\(Bradford).\n24- Store at -20°C for further investigations \\(western blot) if not used immediately.\n**Mitochondrial calcium uptake**\n25- Wash twice the mitochondrial pellet mito-I \\(from step 12) with 1 ml of fresh cold KCL medium.\n26- Centrifuge 10 min at 10,600 _g_ at +4°C.\n27- Determine the amount of mitochondrial proteins \\(Bradford).\n28- Transfer 75 µg of proteins into a new 1.5 ml centrifuge tube and adjust volume to 1 ml with KCL medium.\n29- Centrifuge 10 min at 10,600 _g_ at +4°C.\n30- Gently resuspend the pellet with 180 µl of KCL medium containing 1 μM of the cytosolic calcium probe OregonGreen 5N.\n31- Transfer all the volume in a well of a black 96-well plate with flat and transparent bottom.\n32- OregonGreen 5N fluorescence intensity is measured using a Mithras LB 940 multimode microplate reader with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 510 nm.",
    "33- Fluorescence intensity is measured every 2 s for 5 min.\n34- After 30 s measurement, 20 µl of KCL buffer supplemented with 200 µM CaCl<sub>2</sub> is injected \\(final concentration of CaCl<sub>2</sub> 20 µM).\n35- The decrease of fluorescence intensity following the peak induced by CaCl<sub>2</sub> injection is representative of the mitochondrial calcium uptake."
