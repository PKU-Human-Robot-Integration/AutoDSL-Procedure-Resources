    "All animal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (#06-07-011).\n1. Gold Nanostar Core Synthesis\nNOTE: Gold nanostars are used as cores for both flavors of SERRS nanoprobes used in this experiment.\nPrepare 800 mL of 60 mM ascorbic acid (C6H8O6) solution in deionized (DI) water and 8 mL of 20 mM tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl4) solution in DI water. Cool to 4 °C.\nPerform this reaction step at 4 °C. Place a conical flask containing 800 mL of the ascorbic acid solution on a magnetic stir plate and induce a steady vortex. Quickly add 8 mL of the tetrachloroauric acid solution into the vortex. Within seconds, nanostars will form and the solution will assume a dark blue color. In case the color at any time becomes pink or purple, signifying the formation of nanospheres, the suspension should be discarded and the synthesis reattempted.\nPour the nanostar suspension into 50 mL conical tubes, and centrifuge for 20 min (4 °C, 3,220 x g). Aspirate the supernatant leaving approximate 200 µL of the solution in each tube. Pay caution not to disturb the pellet of nanoparticles at the bottom of the tube.\nNOTE: The supernatant should have a blue tint because of remaining suspended nanostars.\nUsing a micropipette, agitate the solution to suspend and collect the nanoparticles from each tube. Part of the pellet may be compacted on the bottom of the tube and will not resuspend even with vigorous pipetting-discard this part.\nTransfer the nanoparticle suspension to a dialysis cassette (MWCO 3.5 kDa) and dialyze at least three days against 2 L of DI water, changing the water daily. Store nanostars in dialysis at 4 °C for up to a month with water changes every 3-4 days.",
    "NOTE: The nanostars should be kept in dialysis until required for the silication reaction, as described in section 2.\n2. Formation of the Silica Shell\nNOTE: Two flavors of Raman nanoprobes are synthesized. The synthesis procedure is the same for both, with the only difference being the Raman reporter molecule (dye) used. In this experiment, IR780 perchlorate and IR140 are used. The reaction should always be performed in plastic containers. The synthesis is highly scalable and can be adjusted for the desired amount of injectate required. Here, a medium batch synthesis is described, which can be scaled linearly to lower or higher volumes as needed, with the same concentrations and reaction times. The reactions for the two SERRS nanoprobe types can be performed in parallel. Pay attention to avoid cross-contamination. Sonication should be performed for the redispersion of nanoparticle pellets after centrifugation during washing steps, or after the nanoparticles were stored for longer than one hour. Sonication should be performed until the nanoparticles are clearly suspended into the solution, typically for 1 s.\nIn Tube A (a 50 mL conical tube), mix 10 mL of isopropanol, 500 µL of TEOS, 200 µL of DI water, and 60 µL of dye (IR780 perchlorate or IR140, 20 mM in DMF (dimethylformamide)).\nIn Tube B (15 mL conical tube), mix 3 mL of ethanol and 200 µL of ammonium hydroxide. Sonicate the nanostars from Step 1.4 to disperse any clusters in solution and add 1.2 mL of nanostars to the tube.\nNOTE: the ammonium hydroxide solution is highly volatile and hard to pipette accurately. Store it at 4 °C, until needed, to facilitate pipetting.",
    "Place Tube A on a vortex mixer and induce a steady vortex. Rapidly add the contents of Tube B into the vortex and keep mixing for about 5 s. Immediately transfer to a shaker and let react for 15 min while shaking at 300 rpm, at room temperature.\nAfter the 15 min incubation, quench the reaction by adding ethanol to fill the 50 mL tube. Centrifuge for 20 min at 3,220 x g and 4 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant, leaving about 0.5 mL of solution, being careful not to disturb the pellet. Add 1 mL of ethanol and agitate with a pipette to resuspend the nanoparticles. Transfer to a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and wash 4 times with ethanol by centrifuging at 11,000 x g for 4 min, aspirating the supernatant, and resuspending the pellet by ultrasonication for approximately 1 s.\nNOTE: At this stage, the silicated nanoparticles can be functionalized, as described in section 3, or resuspended in DI water with an extra washing step, for storage at 4 °C for up to a week.\n3. Surface Functionalization\nNOTE: IR780 SERRS nanoprobes will be conjugated with folate receptor-targeting antibodies via a PEG crosslinker to form αFR-NPs; IR140 SERRS control nanoprobes will be conjugated with a passivating PEG monolayer, for nt-NPs. Both flavors are formed via a thiol-maleimide reaction in separate but parallel reactions.\nWash nanoparticles twice by centrifuging at 11,000 x g for 4 min, aspirating the supernatant, and resuspending the pellet in 1 mL of ethanol by ultrasonication. Repeat the washing step once more, but redisperse in 1 mL of 85% ethanol, 10% 3-MPTMS (3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane), and 5% DI water. Incubate at room temperature for 1-2 h to introduce thiols on the particle surface.",
    "Wash the thiol-functionalized nanoparticles by centrifuging at 11,000 x g for 4 min, aspirating the supernatant and resuspending the pellet by ultrasonication, twice in ethanol, twice in DI, and finally in HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) buffer (10 mM, pH 7.1), and set aside.\nNOTE: MES (2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid) buffer or HEPES should be used. Buffers with higher salinity, such as PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), may induce nanoparticle aggregation.\nFor the antibody functionalized αFR-NPs, react 200 µg of antibodies (anti-folate binding protein antibody clone [LK26]) with tenfold molar excess of PEG crosslinker (poly(ethylene glycol)(N-hydroxysuccinimide 5-pentanoate) ether N′-(3-maleimidopropionyl) aminoethane (CAS: 851040-94-3), in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) in 500 µL of MES buffer (10 mM, pH 7.1) for 30 min.\nRemove excess crosslinker and concentrate antibody by centrifuging the antibody-PEG solution in a centrifugal filter (MWCO 100 kDa). For the centrifugal filters used in this study, perform centrifugation for 10 min at 14,000 x g and 23 °C. Recover the conjugated antibodies in a fresh tube by inverting the filter and centrifuging at 1,000 x g for 2 min.\nPipette the IR780 nanoparticles from Step 3.2 into the tube with the antibodies and agitate with the pipette to mix. Incubate the mixture for at least 30 min at room temperature, or, alternatively at 4 °C overnight to form the αFR-NPs.\nTo form nt-NPs, add 1% w/v methoxy-terminated (m)PEG5000-maleimide (CAS: 99126-64-4) dissolved in DMSO to the IR140 SERRS nanoparticles from Step 3.2 and let react in 500 µL MES buffer (10 mM, pH 7.1) for at least 30 min at room temperature, or, alternatively at 4 °C overnight.",
    "For administration to mice (section 5), spin down both nanoprobe flavors at 11,000 x g for 4 min, aspirate the supernatant to remove solution with free unreacted antibodies/PEG, and redisperse each flavor in MES buffer (10 mM, pH 7.1) at 600 pM concentration. When resuspending the nanoparticles, minimize unnecessary exposure to the ultrasound, to prevent denaturation of the antibody.\n4. Mouse Model Development\nEstablish a steady culture of human ovarian adenocarcinoma (SKOV-3) cell line. Optionally, to enable monitoring via bioluminescence/fluorescence, use transfected SKOV-3 Luc+/GFP+ cells. Culture cells in RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute) medium with 10% fetal calf serum and passage twice a week. For injection, incubate cells with 0.25% trypsin/0.05% EDTA for 3 min to detach, and subsequently wash and resuspend in PBS at 2 x 106 cells/100 µL.\nTo establish the ovarian micrometastasis model, inject 200 µL of suspended SKOV-3 cells intraperitoneally into athymic female mice (FOXn1nu/FOXn1nu mice, 6-8 weeks old). Disseminated peritoneal spread will occur in approximately 4 weeks. If using SKOV-3 Luc+ cells, tumor growth can be monitored with bioluminescence by administering 2 mg of beetle luciferin in 50 µL PBS via retroorbital injection.\n5. Nanoprobe Injection and Imaging\nPrepare nanoprobes (αFR-NPs and nt-NPs) as described in sections 1-3 and mix at a 1:1 ratio, for a final concentration of 300 pM of each type in MES buffer (10 mM, pH 7.1). Optionally, prepare reference standards of 30 pM of each of the nanoprobe flavors in small (100 µL) conical tubes.\nInject intraperitoneally 1 mL of the nanoparticle suspension in each mouse and gently massage the belly to distribute the nanoparticles within the peritoneal cavity. Return the mouse to its housing. After 25 or more minutes, euthanize the mouse via CO2 asphyxiation.",
    "Fasten the mouse on a surgical platform, at the supine position (for whole abdomen imaging, the platform needs to be mountable onto the upright microscope stage).\nUsing serrated forceps and dissection scissors, remove the skin to expose the peritoneum and perform a large sagittal incision (between 2 and 3 cm in length) to expose the whole abdomen. Attach the peritoneal flaps onto the platform. Wash the inside of the peritoneal cavity with at least 60 mL of PBS using a plastic squirt bottle.\nNOTE: To enable unobstructed imaging of the whole abdomen, the intestines need to be mobilized or excised. For excision, resect with a ligation of the mesenteric vessels in order to reduce hemorrhage into the abdominal cavity.\nAlternatively, to image specific organs, excise them after the PBS wash, and place them onto a microscope slide.\nTransfer the platform or slide to a Raman microspectrophotometer with upright optical configuration and a motorized stage for imaging; use a commercial system with a 300 mW 785 nm diode laser, with a grating of 1,200 grooves per mm, centered at 1,115 cm-1.\nFocus on the area of interest using white light optics, parfocal with the Raman laser. Select the area to be imaged and the desired resolution; in this report a high-speed acquisition mode was used (spectra acquired under continuous laser illumination with the microscope stage constantly moving, with effective spatial resolution 14.2 µm by 200 µm; at 5x magnification, 100 mW power at objective, and <100 ms exposure per point).\nNOTE: The tubes with the reference nanoprobes from Step 5.1 can be placed within the imaged area if desired, to provide internal reference standards for the subsequent analysis. Make sure no extraneous light sources other than the laser reach the objective.",
    "Optionally, prepare the sample for histological processing and validation by fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 °C. Rinse with PBS at 4 °C for 15 min at least twice. Keep the sample in 70% ethanol in water until standard histological processing and paraffin embedding. For histological validation of the tumors, sections (5 µm thick) from different depths of the paraffin block can be stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).\n6. Data Processing and Visualization\nNOTE: All data processing was performed with a graphical user interface developed in-house, using commercial software. All of the functions used have generic equivalents available in other computing environments.\nObtain reference spectra for the two flavors, by interrogating pure suspensions of each. The reference spectra can be derived from point scans of the nanoprobes, imaging of the nanoprobes in well-plates, or by including internal references in the experimental scans in the reference tubes (see Step 5.1).\nPreprocess the reference spectra, by using baseline subtraction (Whittaker filter, λ = 200), normalization by the area under the curve, and Savitzky-Golay derivative filter (second-degree polynomial fit, first-order derivative, width = 15 steps). These preprocessed spectra will serve as references for the classical least squares (CLS) model.\nPreprocess the sample data from the image in the same way as the reference spectra. Obtain CLS scores for each sample point by using an available CLS algorithm. The direct CLS (DCLS) scores are simply the coordinates of the projection of a sample spectrum onto the linear space defined by the generalized inverse matrix (Moore-Penrose inverse) of the reference spectra. Other fitting algorithms can be used (non-negative least squares, partial least squares, or others).",
    "NOTE: Some fitting algorithms can give rise to negative scores, which in this context are not physical. If this is the case, a threshold could be set to exclude negative scores, or a constrained non-negative least squares algorithm be employed instead.\nCalculate the pointwise ratio of the scores on the reference for the targeted nanoparticles (ScoresαFR) over the scores on the reference for the non-targeted nanoparticles (Scoresnt). If the scores are non-negative, the ratio can be expressed in a logarithmic fashion:\n\tR = log10(ScoresαFR/ Scoresnt).\n\tThe ratio R is best displayed in a diverging color scale centered at zero, to express the relative abundance of the probes in orders of magnitude. The resulting image can be overlaid onto the white light image of the sample, to reveal areas of folate receptor overexpression.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
