    "Plasmid DNA isolationCulture L. lactis harboring either pNZ6200, pNZ6202, or pNZ9531 in 200 ml M17 supplemented with 1% glucose in a 200 ml bottle containing the appropriate antibiotic (Table 1) at 30 °C without shaking overnight.Table 1. Characteristics of plasmids used in this protocolimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180702/20180702223124_1327.jpgPellet cells by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 15 min at room temperature.Discard the culture supernatant and freeze the pellets at -20 °C for at least 30 min.Resuspend the pellets in 10 ml resuspension buffer (manufacturer’s solution from the Maxiprep Kit) containing 40 mg lysozyme.Incubate for 1.5 h at 55 °C without shaking.Proceed with the plasmid isolation according to the manufacturer’s protocol from either the JETSTAR 2.0 Maxiprep Kit or PureLinkTM HiPure Plasmid Maxiprep Kit. Include some extra steps to the manufacturer’s protocol: After centrifugation of the lysates to pellet cell debris, perform phenol-chloroform extraction on the supernatants (phenol: chloroform: supernatant in 1:1:1 volume ratio, mix by inverting the tube) and centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 30 min. Transfer the aqueous phase (upper layer) to a new tube and subject to chloroform extraction (aqueous phase: chloroform 1:1 volume) and subsequent centrifuge at 5,000 x g for 15 min. Load purified fractions on the column from the manufacturer’s kit to allow binding of the DNA and continue the steps as indicated in the manual supplied.Determine DNA concentration of plasmid DNA by Qubit (1 µg of DNA is required per transformation where the concentration of the plasmid solution is based on Qubit measurement).Check the quality of the isolated plasmid DNA on a 1% agarose gel.Electrotransformation of pNZ6200 and pNZ9531 into electrocompetent L. lactis cells (Figure 1)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180702/20180702223316_0298.jpgFigure 1.

    "See the notes in the procedure section for specific cases where we advise modifications to this standard flow scheme.Prepare 1 L of the electro competence growth medium GSGM17, 500 ml washing solution 1 and 500 ml washing solution 2 (see Recipes). Culture L. lactis initially overnight in 10 ml GM17 in a 12 ml Cell Culture Tube, incubate at 30 °C without shaking.The next day, inoculate 5 ml culture into 50 ml GSGM17 and incubate cells overnight at 30 °C, without shaking.Dilute the overnight culture 1:8 in GSGM17 if the overnight culture reached an OD600 of ≥ 0.7 and grow the culture to an OD600 of 0.2-0.3.Pellet cells by centrifugation at 6,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.Wash the pellet with 1 volume ice-cold washing solution 1.Pellet cells by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.Wash the pellet with 0.5 volume ice-cold washing solution 2 and incubate on ice for 15 min.Pellet cells by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.Wash the pellet with 0.25 volume ice-cold washing solution 1 and pellet cells by centrifugation at 5,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C.Resuspend cells in 0.01 volume ice-cold washing solution 1 and aliquot cells per 50 µl.Use fresh electrocompetent cells immediately for transformation with the desired plasmid.Option: Store cells for later use at -80 °C.Keep electro-cuvettes on ice and prepare recovery medium containing M17 supplemented with 1% glucose, 200 mM MgCl2 and 20 mM CaCl2 and store it on ice as well.Add 1 µg plasmid to electrocompetent cells and transfer the cell suspension with DNA into the electro-cuvette.Note: Do not pipet up and down after addition of plasmid DNA to the electrocompetent cells. Mix cells and plasmid DNA by gently flicking the tube.",
    "Electroporate; settings for the electroporator device: voltage = 2,000 V, capacity = 25 µF, resistance = 200 Ω.Dry the electro-cuvette with a tissue and tap the electro-cuvette gently onto the bench 5 times to slip down the cells to the bottom of the electro-cuvette.Put the electro-cuvette in the cuvette holder of the electroporator and apply the electrical pulse.Add 1 ml of ice-cold recovery medium as soon as possible to the electro-cuvette and put the electro-cuvette on ice again.Pipet the cells from the electro-cuvette into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and incubate samples in a 30 °C water bath for 1 h without shaking.Pipet serial dilutions for 100 to 10-6 in recovery medium on selection plates with appropriate antibiotics.Incubate plates for 2-3 days at 30 °C under non-shaking conditions.Clean streak positive colonies on a GM17 agar plate supplemented with appropriate antibiotics.Note: If co-transformation of pNZ9531 and pNZ6200 is unsuccessful, transform cells first with pNZ9531. Select positive colonies and culture colonies in GM17 supplemented with 10 µg/ml erythromycin. Subsequently, repeat the preparation for electro competence cells and introduce pNZ6200 by electroporation.The next day, culture single colonies from the clean streak plate in GM17 supplemented with appropriate antibiotics and incubate overnight at 30 °C under non-shaking conditions.Prepare a 25% glycerol stock and store at -80 °C.Induction of natural competence in L. lactis Prepare GCDM (see Recipes) and prepare GM17 agar plates with appropriate antibiotics.Culture L. lactis harboring pNZ6200 and pNZ9531 separately in 10 ml GCDM supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics (Table 1).Prepare a 50 ml CELLSTAR® Polypropylene Tube containing 50 ml GCDM.Incubate cells and the 50 ml CELLSTAR® Polypropylene Tube containing 50 ml GCDM at 30 °C overnight in an incubation stove without shaking.The next day, add chloramphenicol and erythromycin to the 50 ml CELLSTAR® Polypropylene Tube with 50 ml GCDM.",
    "Add 1 ml of the GCDM in a semi-micro cuvette (= blank sample) by measuring optical density at OD600.Add 750 µl of the L. lactis harboring pNZ6200 overnight culture to the 50 ml CELLSTAR® Polypropylene Tube tube containing GCDM.Mix the cell culture by inverting the closed tube.Pipet 1 ml of the culture into a semi-micro cuvette and incubate cells in the 30 °C water bath non-shaking until the culture reaches an OD600 of 0.3 (after approximately 3-4 h).Measure the initial OD600 of the culture.Note: The OD600 of the culture at t = 0 should be around 0.03. If the OD600 is lower than 0.03; add more culture.Culture cells until an OD600 of 0.3 (corresponds with approximately 2-3 x 108 cells) under non-shaking conditions.Prepare calculations and recovery medium (see Recipes, 5 ml recovery medium per transformation).Transfer 10 ml of cell culture at OD600 of 0.3 into a 12 ml sterile tube.Repeat this step to obtain a total of 3 aliquoted cultures.Note: These cultures will be used for the later steps involving the induction of comX expression with 0 ng/ml (negative control), 0.03 ng/ml (optimal) and 2 ng/ml (fully induced) nisin.Subsequently, prepare the fresh nisin dilutions by using either NisinA® P Ultrapure Nisin A or nisin from Lactococcus lactis 2.5% (Sigma-Aldrich, 2.5% nisin).Prepare nisin dilutions in glass-tubes by using distilled water containing 0.05% glacial acetic acid in order to increase the stability of the nisin solutions.Note: When using nisin from L. lactis 2.5% (Sigma-Aldrich), make sure you correct for the dilution factor (40x) as only 2.5% of the dry matter is nisin.Induce the 10 ml culture with nisin. For optimal transformation rates, induce cells with nisin to a final concentration of 0.03 ng/ml nisin.Notes: Optional: as a control, include an uninduced sample and a fully induced sample (2 ng/ml).L.",
    "lactis KF147 harboring pNZ6200 induced with 2 ng/ml nisin will stop growth after 1 h induction but other strains might continue growth at this concentration. Mix immediately by inverting the tubes 3 times after addition of nisin.Put 600 µl of the induced culture in an Eppendorf tube.Add 1 µg pNZ6202.Note: It is likely that other compatible plasmids can also be used to assess transformation efficiencies.Mix by inverting the tube.Incubate at 30 °C for 2 h in a water bath without shaking.Note: Longer incubation with nisin does not lead to increased transformation rates (see Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180702/20180702224521_9996.jpgFigure 2. Transformation rate (transformants/total cell number after induction/µg plasmid DNA) after prolonged nisin induction in L. lactis KF147 harboring pNZ6200. Transformation was examined in uninduced (closed circles), moderately induced (closed squares) and fully induced (closed triangles) cultures. Uninduced and fully induced L. lactis KF147 harboring pNZ6200 were not transformable after shortened, standard (2 h) and prolonged induction with nisin. Moderately induced L. lactis KF147 harboring pNZ6200 could be transformed after prolonged nisin induction, however, prolonged induction did not lead to increased transformation rates as compared with the standard incubation time.Pipet 100 µl of each sample into a semi-micro cuvette containing 900 µl GM17 and measure the OD600 of the sample or perform a total cell count.Note: Take 1 ml of GM17 as a new blank.Add the remaining 500 µl in the 5 ml recovery medium in a 15 ml tube and incubate for another 2 h at 30 °C in a water bath non-shaking.Note: When transforming a plasmid or PCR product that contains a resistance gene against bacteriostatic antibiotics, this recovery step is not necessary.Add 250 µl of the culture in a semi-micro cuvette containing 750 µl GM17 to measure OD600 or perform a total cell count.",
    "Pellet the rest of the culture in the 15 ml CELLSTAR® Polypropylene Tube by centrifugation at 4,000 x g for 10 min.Discard supernatant, leave 100 µl medium onto the pellet, resuspend and plate all cells on GM17A (M17 agar supplemented with 2% glucose) with appropriate antibiotics.Keep the plates in the incubation stove at 30 °C for 2 to 3 days.Calculate the transformation rate as (transformants/total cell number after induction/µg plasmid DNA)."
