    "The following protocol describes an experimental procedure for inducing and monitoring the growth of experimental orthotopic renal tumors and any potential spontaneous metastases. All of the following procedures are done in accordance with institutional policies and approved procedures regarding the humane use of experimental animals.\n1. Maintenance of Cell Lines\nMaintain murine renal adenocarcinoma cell line, Renca, in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 1 mM each of non-essential amino acids, L-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate (referred to as complete RPMI). Culture cells in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: As with any established cell line, it is recommended to use low passage-number Renca cells for transfection and subsequent implantation to minimize any phenotypic or genetic changes that could occur after long-term culture.\n\t\nUse a transposon system to engineer Renca cells to stably express green fluorescent protein (GFP) and firefly luciferase.\n\t\t\nUsing a cationic liposome-based transfection reagent, co-transfect Renca cells with a transposase expression vector (pPGK-SB11) and a transposon vector encoding for the expression of firefly luciferase, as well as a fusion gene encoding for GFP and the zeocin resistance gene, both under the transcriptional control of a bi-directional promoter (pKT2/LuBiG)19.\nTwo days later, plate the transfected cells at a limiting dilution and allow the cells to expand in complete RPMI supplemented with zeocin (300 µg/mL). Confirm GFP expression in each clone by flow cytometry. These cells are termed Renca-GL.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Limiting-dilution cloning will permit the selected cells to be derived from a single cell.\nTo implant Renca cells intrarenally, prepare Renca cells into a single-cell suspension at 2 x 106 cells/mL in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS).",
    "Remove adherent Renca cells from the tissue culture flask using 0.25% trypsin in HBSS. After ~ 5 min, add complete RPMI to the flask to neutralize the trypsin and transfer the cells to a centrifuge tube for washing. Centrifuge the cells at 300 relative centrifugal g force (rcf x g) for 5 min at 25 °C.\nDecant the supernatant and resuspend the cells in HBSS. Count the cells using a hemocytometer and adjust the volume with HBSS to yield 2 x 106 cells/mL.\nDraw the cells into a 1-mL syringe fitted with an 18-gauge needle to prevent shear stress on the cells. Replace the 18-gauge needle with a 28-gauge needle prior to the injection of the tumor cells. An injection of 0.1 mL delivers 2 x 105 cells into the kidney.\n2. Surgical Area Preparation\nPrepare a sterile surgical area in a biosafety cabinet by placing a sterile surgical drape over a heating pad. Gather all supplies, including forceps, scalpel, scissors, eye drops, 5% povidone-iodine antiseptic, and sterile gauze. Autoclave all instruments prior to use.\nPerform the surgery using an aseptic tip technique. Resterilize instruments between animals with a bead sterilizer. Wear sterile gloves, a lab coat, and a face mask.\n3. Animal Preparation\nAnesthetize the mice with ketamine/xylazine (87.5 mg/kg and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively, i.p.) according to institutional guidelines. Determine anesthetic depth by performing a toe-pinch.\nWhen the animal is considered non-responsive, prepare the injection site (e.g., left flank) on Balb/c mice by plucking (with fingers) or shaving (using clippers) the fur.\nMove the mice from the surgery prep area (e.g., the housing cage) to the surgical area and apply vet ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness. Liberally swab the prepared incision site with 5% povidone-iodine antiseptic.",
    "Inject bupivacaine hydrochloride (0.1 mL of a 2.5 mg/mL solution, s.c.) into the area where the incision will be made as a pre-operative analgesia.\nMake a single incision (~ 1.0 - 1.5 cm) on the left flank of the animal using a sterile scalpel or scissors, carefully so as not to penetrate the peritoneum. Separate the dermis from the peritoneum with sterile scissors. Dab the incision site with sterile cotton gauze to remove any blood.\nHold the mouse with both hands, using the left hand to hold the head and the right hand to support the flank.\nIdentify the spleen through the peritoneum and, with one finger of the right hand, palpate the mouse from underneath; the kidney should now be visible through the peritoneum. Keep a firm hold of the animal to provide tension across the peritoneum and kidney.\nHave a second person inject the tumor cells (prepared in section 1.2.) through the intact peritoneum into the center of the kidney using a 1-mL syringe fitted with a 28-gauge needle. Slowly deliver 0.1 mL (2 x 105) of cells. Once the cells are injected, hold the needle in place for 5 - 10 s to reduce the backflow of cells. It is important to note the need for extreme caution during this step, as the person injecting the cells will bringing the needle into close proximity to the fingers of the person holding the mouse.\nRemove the needle and close the incision with a thin layer of cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive.",
    "Place the animal back into a clean cage with a sterile paper towel. Allow the animals to recover on a heating pad. Do not leave the animals unattended during the recovery period. Do not return the animals to standard housing conditions until they are upright and sternal. Follow institutional guidelines in all procedures using laboratory animals.\n4. Bioluminescent Imaging\nMonitor tumor growth by bioluminescent imaging.\n\tNOTE: Procedural details for performing bioluminescent imaging can be obtained from Lim et al.20 The luciferase signal can be detected as early as 24 h after tumor cell implantation. As there is no externally-visible tumor in this model, it is essential to monitor tumor growth periodically. Depending on the designed experiment, orthotopic tumor growth can proceed for varying lengths of time. One benefit of using the luciferase-expressing Renca cells is that tumor growth can be repeatedly monitored in the same animal at regular intervals for the duration of the experiment, and a specific interrogation of tumor-bearing and tumor-free organs can be done at a defined endpoint.\n\t\nInject luciferin (0.1 mL of a 15 mg/mL solution in sterile PBS) i.p. and allow it to circulate for 10 min before placing the mouse into the bioluminescence imaging system. Place the mouse with its dorsal side up, rolled slightly on its side, in order to have the injected kidney facing up.\nMeasure the tumor burden in photons of light emitted per second (photon flux) within a defined region of interest (r.o.i.) using image analysis software.\nQuantitation of tumor burden in individual organs.\n\tNOTE: Quantitation can be performed at defined time points in individual organs after their removal from euthanized mice.\n\t\nInject the mice with luciferin, as in step 4.1.\nAfter 10 min, euthanize the mice using an approved procedure.",
    "Dissect out the organs of interest (e.g., the kidneys and lungs; see section 5 below). Transfer the tissue to 35 x 10-mm Petri dishes and place them into the bioluminescence imaging system.\nMeasure the tumor burden in photons of light emitted per second (photon flux) within a defined r.o.i. using image analysis software.\n5. Organ Harvest\nAt a defined endpoint for the individual experiment, euthanize tumor-bearing mice according to preferred institutional guidelines (e.g., CO2, cervical dislocation, anesthesia overdose). However, avoid cervical dislocation if lungs are to be collected after India ink inflation.\nPerform a gross assessment of primary renal tumor growth in the injected kidney by measuring the wet organ weight.\n\t\nTo determine the tumor mass (in g), isolate21 and weigh the tumor-bearing kidney and the contralateral kidney from the same mouse, where the difference in kidney weights defines the tumor mass. Carefully dissect away any extraneous connective tissue from the excised kidneys before measuring their weights.\nAssess the degree of tumor metastasis to the lungs by inflating the lungs with India ink prior to excision and immediately fixing the lungs in Fekete's solution22. Manual calculation of metastatic lesions on the lung surface can then be performed.\n\t\nMake a midline incision using scissors starting at the mid-abdomen, through the ribcage, and up through the neck/salivary glands. Carefully remove the rib cage using scissors and forceps, without compromising the lung tissue.\nExpose the trachea by removing the connective tissue.\nPrepare a 3 mL syringe with an 18-gauge needle filled with 10% India ink solution in HBSS.\nUsing forceps, carefully thread a silk suture under the trachea. This will be used to tie off the trachea once inflated.",
    "Carefully insert the needle down the trachea and slowly depress the syringe to inflate the lungs with the India ink solution. Approximately 1 - 1.5 mL of India ink solution will fully inflate the lungs.\nPinch the trachea shut by tying several knots, with the suture below the needle to inhibit the backflow of the ink.\nRemove the needle and carefully cut away the connective tissue to remove the inflated lungs.\nIn a chemical fume hood, place the lungs into a 15-mL conical tube containing 5 mL of Fekete's solution (35 mL of 95% EtOH, 15 mL of dH2O, 5 mL of formaldehyde, and 2.5 mL of glacial acidic acid in a 100-mL glass bottle)23.\nAllow the lungs to fix/destain for 24 - 48 h at room temperature prior to manually counting the destained tumor nodules.\nRemove the intact lungs after destaining and carefully dissect the fixed lungs by lobe in a 35 x 10 mm Petri dish. Count the number of tumor nodules (white nodules) on each lobe under a dissecting microscope.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
