    "Design of crisprRNA targeting exon 3 of CD274 and 4-base pair HindIII restriction site insert Search CD274 on an appropriate genome browser (e.g., www.ensembl.org[href=http://www.ensembl.org] or www.genome.ucsc.edu[href=http://www.genome.ucsc.edu]) and download gene sequence. Check the gene for transcript variants, exons/introns, and corresponding protein domains. Cd274 has one protein-coding transcript (Ensembl Gene: CD274 ENSMUSG00000016496; Ensembl Transcript: CD274-201), which has seven exons.Open CD274 sequence on CLC Genomic Workbench and annotate regions of interest [(e.g., exons of targeted transcript with corresponding open reading frames (ORF)].Choose the location you want to target (i.e., exon 3) (Figure 1).Copy the sequence you want to target into an appropriate guideRNA design tool (e.g., www.crispor.tefor.net[href=http://www.crispor.tefor.net]). Choose guide sequence length, the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM site), the Cas9 protein you want to use (i.e., 20bp-NGG–Sp Cas9), and the latest assembly of the respective Mus musculus reference genome (i.e., UCSC Dec. 2011 mm10=C57BL/6J). PAM is a short DNA sequence (2–6 bp, depending on the Cas enzyme) following the DNA region targeted for cleavage by CRISPR/Cas9 and, in case of the Streptococcus pyogenes (Sp) Cas9 nuclease, can be found 3–4 nucleotides downstream of the predicted cut site. While the guide sequence defines the crRNA or guideRNA–DNA interaction, it is essential for the DNA–protein interaction.Choose the best guide sequence to use (see guide sequence “guide_61/fw_ex3” in Table 1 and Figure 1).Note: The goal is to get a double-strand break that leads to homologous recombination, so that a ssDNA donor repair template containing a 4-base pair HindIII restriction site with 57 bp (left) and 50 bp (right) homology arms on either side can be inserted. This will lead to a +1 frameshift and a stop codon 75 bp downstream of the restriction site (Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4724/bioprotoc-13-14-4724-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "Dilute lyophilized crRNA and tracrRNA (usually 2 nmol) to 100 μM stock concentration in TE buffer. Then, further dilute to 10 μM working concentration in TE buffer.Note: Working with RNA requires RNase-free working conditions, as RNA is not very stable and can be degraded by RNases very quickly. RNA samples should always be stored on ice and only diluted in RNase-free reagents. The crRNA and tracrRNA can be diluted and aliquoted in TE buffer and stored at -80 °C for up to a year. Per reaction, in a PCR reaction tube, incubate 3.68 μL of crRNA with 1.84 μL of tracrRNA in 5 μL of microinjection buffer at 78 °C for 10 min on a PCR heating block, followed by 37 °C for 30 min (Mix 1).Note: For uncut control, include one reaction to which you do not add crRNA. Replace this volume (3.68 μL) with ddH2O. Remove from heating block and slowly cool down to room temperature (RT) for 15 min.Take 10.7 μL of Mix 1 and add 0.5 μL of Cas9 (20 μM) and 38.8 μL of ddH2O. Pipette up and down a couple of times and incubate for 10 min at RT (Mix 2).Take 15 μL of Mix 2 and add 2 μL of Cas9 10× buffer and 400–500 ng of target DNA and fill up with ddH2O to 20 μL.Note: With a final volume of 20 μL, maximum 3 μL of DNA target and 15 μL of Mix 2 can be added. When the concentration of the target DNA is low and e.g., 6 μL needs to be added to reach 400–500 ng, increase the Cas9 10× buffer to e.g., 3 μL, Mix 2 to 22.5 μL, and final volume to 30 μL.",
    "Incubate at 37 °C for 60 min and load onto 2% agarose gel (2 g of agarose/mL of TAE buffer).Add loading dye to the samples and load DNA ladder and samples onto the gel. Run the gel at 100 V until bands have separated well.Note: The in vitro digestion allows you to evaluate the potential of your guide for in vivo cutting efficiency. You get an idea of the cutting efficiency by comparing the intensity of the uncut amplicon to the two cutting products. When a guide already does not cut the target amplicon in an in vitro digest, the probability of efficient cutting in vivo might also be low. Likewise, when comparing two guides for the same DNA target site, a combination of specificity score and cutting efficiency will help to choose the optimal guide. Expected band sizes are approximately 400 bp for the uncut amplicon and 200 bp for the cut product (Figure 2). Design ssDNA oligo as HDR donor template to integrate defined frameshift and enzyme restriction site Choose appropriate guide sequence to target locus of interest.Note: For a complete loss-of-function phenotype, a good guide sequence does not target a locus in front of an alternative start site (ATG), a locus including SNPs, or a locus close to the C-terminal site. Furthermore, it is important to not target non-constitutive exons (exons not present in all isoforms of the gene) (Doench, 2018). We targeted exon 3, as these guide sequences generally show higher specificity and efficacy than guides targeting exon 2. We chose guide_61/fw_ex3, as this crRNA has the highest specificity and efficacy score and less off targets than guide_109/fw_ex3 depicted by CRISPOR (Table 4). Table 4. Potential crRNAs with respective target loci, sequence and specificity, and efficacy scores according to CRISPOR.",

    "Design ssDNA donor repair template:To induce homology-directed repair and generate a +1 frameshift, design a ssDNA template that spans the targeted locus and cutting site with two homologous arms of 57 bp (left) and 50 bp (right).Note: The double-strand break will be between position 17 and 18 of the protospacer (guide) sequence. This might differ according to the type of Cas9 and guideRNA used. We used Sp Cas9 that has a cutting site between the third and the fourth bp upstream of the PAM site of guide_61/fw_ex3 (TGG). Add an insert of 1 or 4 bp in between the two homology arms to induce a frameshift (see “HDR template HindIII +1fs” in Table 1 and Figure 3).Note: We designed the insert and homology arms in a way that 3 bp of the wildtype sequence (CGA) get replaced by a 4 bp HindIII restriction site (AGCT), thereby conveniently replacing the A of the start codon in exon 3 with the T of the restriction site. Add homology arms with 57 bp (left) and 50 bp (right) homologous sequences.Order ssDNA donor template.Preparation of microinjection mix with CRISPR/Cas9 ribonucleoprotein particle (RNP) plus HDR oligo repair template Resuspend lyophilized crRNA and tracrRNA in 1× microinjection buffer to a final concentration of 10 μM:Mix a total of 1.84 μL of crRNA and tracrRNA with 5 μL of 10× injection buffer and 0.5 μL of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 protein (20 μM) and subsequently incubate for 15 min at 37 °C.For knock-in mouse production, add 500 ng of ssDNA donor template (HDR template HindIII +1fs) after incubation.Dilute the mix with ddH2O to a final volume of 50 μL.Spin the final mix down at 21,000× g for 3 min at RT.Keep injection mix at RT during the injection procedure.",
    "Notes:  The microinjection procedure was performed at the transgenesis core of the University of Zürich, Switzerland and cannot be performed with simple laboratory equipment. A short description of the procedure is found in section E. For a more detailed description of the reproductive biology and the microinjection procedure, please refer to the transgenesis core of your research facility. As a quality control measure after the microinjection procedure, the enzymatic activity of the injection mix (can be stored at -80 °C) can be tested by adding target DNA and essentially performing an in vitro digestion as described in section B. Zygote microinjection, embryo culture, and retransfer into pseudopregnant foster animals Microinjection was performed at the transgenesis core of the University of Zürich, Institute of Laboratory Animal Science under license of the cantonal veterinary office in accordance with federal law. C57BL/6 mice at 3–4 weeks of age (Charles River Laboratories, Germany) were super ovulated by intraperitoneal injection of 5 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (Folligon, MSD Animal Health GmbH, Luzern, Switzerland) followed 48 h later by injection of 5 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (Pregnyl, MSD Animal Health GmbH, Luzern, Switzerland). Mouse zygotes were obtained by mating C57BL/6J stud males with superovulated C57BL/6 females. Zygote microinjections (pronuclear injection into the male pronucleus), embryo culture o/n, and retransfer of 2-cell stage embryos into pseudopregnant foster animals via surgical embryo transfer were performed according to standard mouse transgenesis protocols (e.g., Harms et al., 2014; Quadros et al., 2018).Screening of founders by PCR followed by HindIII digest of the amplicon Take biopsies of the resulting founder pups after zygote implantation.Amplify the DNA target site by PCR with Qiagen Taq PCR core kit (Table 2 and Table 3). This leads to a 414 (mutated) or 413 (wild type) bp amplicon.",
    "Note: As a negative control, DNA template in PCR mix can be substituted with 1 μL of ddH2O. After amplification, carefully open the PCR strip and add 0.5 μL of HindIII restriction enzyme/reaction, close reaction tubes again, and incubate at 37 °C in the PCR machine overnight. Cave: confirm on the NEB table (https://international.neb.com/tools-and-resources/usage-guidelines/activity-of-restriction-enzymes-in-pcr-buffers[href=https://international.neb.com/tools-and-resources/usage-guidelines/activity-of-restriction-enzymes-in-pcr-buffers]) the activity of HindIII in your Taq buffer. Depending on your Taq, you might need to add HindIII reaction buffer to ensure proper activity.Prepare 1.5% agar gel (1.5 g of agarose/mL TAE buffer).Load DNA ladder and samples with added loading dye onto the gel.Run at 100 V until bands of standard size have separated well.Note: In vitro digestion of amplicon with inserted HindIII restriction site leads to cutting of the 414 bp amplicon into approximately 200 bp fragments. If the donor template has integrated successfully, we expect one band at 200 bp, while the unintegrated wildtype band stays at 413 bp due to the missing HindIII restriction site. Therefore, amplicons derived from wildtype mice will be visible on the gel as one band at 413 bp. Amplicons derived from homozygous mutants will show one band at 200 bp, while heterozygous mutants will show both bands at 200 bp and 413 bp, respectively (Figure 4). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4724/bioprotoc-13-14-4724-g004.jpgFigure 4.

Subsequent digestion with HindIII restriction enzyme after PCR cuts the alleles harboring the de novo integrated HindIII 200 bp fragments. Heterozygous pups show two bands; homozygous pups show one band.",
    "Only pup number 10 has both mutated alleles.Confirm frameshift via Sanger sequencing Prepare your samples for sanger sequencing:Isolate DNA from founder pups and amplify it to get amplicon as described in step F2.Note: Sanger sequencing methods are most precise when DNA is approximately 300–1,000 bp. Choose your primers accordingly. Check quality of DNA template by UV absorption using a NanoDrop.Note: Good-quality DNA will have an A260/A280 ratio of 1.7–2.0. Dilute the DNA template to desired concentration according to the protocol of your sequencing provider.Note: A general rule is 1.5 ng/μL per 100 bp. As our amplicon is 414 bp long, 6–7.5 ng/μL should suffice. Dilute your primers according to the protocol of your sequencing provider.Note: The general rule is 4 μM for premixed primers and 10 μM for separate primers.

Stain the cells with Zombie Aqua and primary fluorophore-conjugated antibodies.Note: In general, it is enough to only stain the cells with a viability dye and an anti-PD-L1 antibody. However, it is recommended to also stain the cells for immune cell markers such as CD45, CD3, and CD11b to discriminate between populations.
