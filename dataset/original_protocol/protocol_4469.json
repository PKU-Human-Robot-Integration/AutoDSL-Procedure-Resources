    "RNA and DNA co-Extraction (Qiagen’s AllPrep DNA/RNA mini kit)For each sample to be extracted prepare one 1.5 ml screw-cap tube and add 300 µl of 1x DPBS.If flow cytometry staining is to be performed, prepare a V-bottom 96 well-plate and add 150 µl of RPMI containing 20% FBS to each sample well.Note: To normalize the data, percentage of CD4+ CD3+ T-cells will be assessed for each sample. If these data are already available, skip steps A2 and A4.Quickly thaw 5 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) aliquot in a 37 °C water-bath, and transfer to 1.5 ml screw cap tube from step 1. Mix well by pipetting a few times. Go directly to step A5 if the flow cytometry staining is not required.Notes: Keep samples on ice during the entire procedure since cell-associated RNA is very unstable.It is highly recommended to not thaw more than two samples at the time; the process before spinning at 8,000 x g cannot take more than 2 min in order to minimize cell-death and loss of cell-associated RNA. Flow staining:Mix the sample by pipetting up and down and transfer 50 µl (around 200,000 cells) to the prepared 96-well plate from step A2.Centrifuge the 96-well plate immediately at 500 x g at room temperature for 3 min.Remove supernatant carefully not disrupting cell pellet with multichannel pipette. Wash with 200 µl RPMI containing 20% FBS; then centrifuge at 500 x g at room temperature for 3 min.Remove supernatant carefully not disrupting cell pellets with multichannel pipette and resuspend in 25 µl staining buffer.Allow the cells to rest for 15 min room tempreture. In the meantime, proceed to the RNA/DNA co-extraction.Pre-mix 1 µl of CD3–APC, 1 µl CD4-FITC, 1 µl CD45–PerCP-Cy5.5 of antibodies per sample in a 1.",
    "5 ml screw-cap tube enough to run all the samples. Add 3 µl of the antibody-mix to each sample well.Incubate 15 min at room temperature in the dark.Add 175 µl staining-buffer to wash the cells.Centrifuge at 500 x g at room temperature for 3 min.Remove supernatant with multichannel and fix the cells with 200 µl of 1% FA. Mix by pipetting up and down and incubate at least 10 min to fix the cells. Acquire the stained samples in the Accuri flow cytometer. If the stained samples are not acquired immediately, store them at 4 °C until acquisition. Analysis should be performed by gating live PBMCs based on forward versus scatter profiles, followed by CD45+ for leukocyte identification. CD4 T cells are identified as double positive for CD3 andCD4 (CD3+ CD4+).Centrifuge the 1.5 ml tubes at 8,000 x g at 4 °C for 2 min.Completely remove supernatant (with a sterile fine-tip transfer pipet) without disrupting the pellet.Add 350 µl RLT plus buffer + β-ME and mix thoroughly to homogenize the cells (vortex for 20 sec).Transfer the homogenized lysate to an All Prep DNA spin column (column with the purple ring) and centrifuge 1 min at >10,000 x g (max speed). Transfer the flow-through to the pink column for RNA purification (steps A11-17).Place the AllPrep DNA column in a clean 2 ml collection tube and store at 4 °C (or room temp for short periods) for DNA purification (steps A18-25). Note: Do not freeze the All Prep DNA spin columns. RNA purificationExtract RNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. Include a DNAse step to avoid any DNA-contamination.To increase RNA yield, heat the elution H2O (provided by the Allprep kit) at 60 °C in a heating block.",
    "For RNA elution, add 35 µl pre-heated H2O to the column and incubate 10 min at room temperature. Repeat elution using the eluate from step 13 at room temperature.Centrifuge 1 min at 10,000 x g.Measure RNA concentration by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop).Immediately proceed to cDNA generation discussed below or store RNA at -80 °C.DNA purificationExtract DNA following the manufacturer’s protocol. To increase DNA yield, perform two sequential elutions (300 µl + 100 µl) with heated 10 mM Tris-HCl or EB Buffer (provided by the Allprep kit) at 60 °C. For the elution, add 300 µl of heated 10 mM Tris-HCl or EB buffer.Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Centrifuge for 1 min at 10,000 x g at room temperature in an Eppendorf tube (provided by the Allprep Kit).Transfer the eluate into a 1.5 ml screw cap tube.Add 100 µl of 10 mM Tris-HCl or EB buffer (second elution).Centrifuge for 1 min at 10,000 x g in an Eppendorf tube.Transfer the eluate to the tube in step A21 for a final volume of 400 µl elution.DNA precipitationAdd to the extracted DNA in this order:1/10 volume of 3 M NaOAc (sodium acetate).1 µl glycogen.2 volumes of 100% ethanol.Mix gently by inverting a few times. A DNA “cloud/ goop” should be visible. Store precipitated DNA samples overnight at -20 °C.Note: If the DNA concentration is expected to be very low DNA can be stored at -80 °C for shorter incubations (at least 2 h) or overnight. After cold incubation, centrifuge at >10,000 x g (max speed) for 30 min at 4 °C.Note: Mark the orientation (north-side) of the tube to indicate where the DNA will pellet.Discard the supernatant carefully with a sterile fine-tip transfer pipet without disturbing the DNA pellet.Wash DNA pellet with 1 ml 70% ethanol (freshly prepared). Mix gently.",
    "Centrifuge at >10,000 x g (max speed) for 30 min at 4 °C.Completely remove supernatant using a fine-tip transfer pipette. Do a quick spin. With a micro-pipette and sterile tip, remove any residual liquid without disrupting the pellet.Let tube air dry for 2 min or until dry.Note: Do not over-dry the pellet.Resuspend DNA pellet in 30 µl of 10 mM Tris-HCl or EB buffer (provided by kit from AllPrep Kit). Measure DNA concentration by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop).Stored at 4 °C (or -20 °C of long term storage).Quantification of HIV DNA [total and 2-LTR circles (long terminal repeat)] and human herpesvirus by ddPCR We recommend running in multiplex CMV and EBV DNA, and total and 2-LTR circles HIV DNA (pol or gag). Since they are rare events, we recommend running them in triplicate. Also we use RPP30 (RNAse P) primer/probe set for host genomic DNA quantification (cell normalizer), which can be run in duplicate. The protocol below describes reagents needed for a single PCR reaction: Scale up to the number of replicates x1.5 to account for sample loss due to pipetting. For example, if running triplicates, prepare DNA and reagents for 4.5 reactions. Preparing DNA samples by restriction digestionEach PCR reaction should contain a final concentration of DNA of ≤200 ng/µl in a total volume of 5 µl per well (maximum 1,000 ng/well). Dilute the samples with 10 mM Tris-HCl if necessary.Notes: If more sample needs to be tested, increase the number of reactions per well proportionally for restriction digestion and later divide into replicate wells for PCR. Do not use more than 1,000 ng of DNA per PCR reaction, as PCR reaction is greatly affected. Prepare a digestion mix with the following components on ice.

Place the plate directly on ice while preparing the subsequent steps. Quantitation of Total and 2-LTR circular HIV DNA, CMV and EBV DNA, and RPP30To quantify RPP30, DNA samples need to be diluted 1:10 to get into the working range-100 ng of DNA is ideal. To do so:In a 96 well plate, aliquot 18 µl of nuclease-free molecular-grade water for each sample.Transfer 2 µl of digested DNA into the appropriate wells.Cap the plate and vortex briefly to mix.Centrifuge at 200 x g for 1 min and place on ice while preparing the subsequent steps.Prepare a PCR mix with the following components on ice.

    "Prepare a 96-well PCR clean plate on ice. Note: When designing a PCR plate layout, it is better to group assay reactions in groups of 8 vertically, with any replicates spanning horizontally across the plate. This optimizes time and use of consumables.For each PCR reaction, add 13.1 µl PCR mix to 6.9 µl non-diluted DNA sample target DNA and diluted 1:10 DNA for RRP30 quantification. Keep the replicates within the same well since they will be divided into separate wells for PCR at the droplet generation stage.For the subsequent droplet generation stage, 8 samples need to be loaded at any one time. If there are insufficient samples to ensure this, prepare the appropriate number of wells containing 20 µl of 1x buffer control solution. Seal the plate using an adhesive film and vortex lightly to ensure adequate mixing of sample and assay mix. Centrifuge at 200 x g for 1 min at room temperature to collect any sample that might have adhered to the top or sides of the wells. Proceed to droplet generation as described below.Droplet generationNote: For this section use low retention pipette tips to reduce pipette errors due to sample or assay mix sticking to plastic tips.Turn on PCR plate sealer to allow it to come to proper temperature (180 °C).Pour 700 ml (1 container) of generator oil into a multichannel reagent trough.Load a cartridge into the droplet generator adaptor.Remove adhesive film from PCR plate. Using low retention tips, transfer 20 µl of PCR reaction to middle wells of cartridge. Use a P-20 multichannel for this process.Note: 8 samples need to be loaded onto a cartridge at any one time. If there are any empty wells, the cartridge will not pressurize correctly and droplets will not form.",
    "Transfer 70 µl of generator oil to the bottom wells of the cartridge. Use a P-200 multichannel for this process. Top wells are empty and will receive generated droplets.Hook generator gasket over generator adaptor and center, load into the droplet generator unit and run.When droplet generation is complete, remove adaptor from unit and discard rubber gasket. Top wells of cartridge will now contain droplets, with middle and lower wells nearly empty.Perform next step slowly and carefully as droplets are fragile and will shear if done too quickly. Avoid pressing and releasing plunger at maximum speed and smoothly draw or aspirate solution with pipette tips to ensure integrity of droplets. Set P-50 multichannel pipette to 40 µl and attach low retention tips; the plunger action on the P-50 is large enough to allow slow pipetting action to reduce shearing of the droplets. With the holder flat, position multichannel at ~80° angle so that pipette tips rest against the bottom of the cartridge. Slowly draw 40 µl of droplets from outlet wells.You should see a milky color in pipette tips; these are the formed droplets. Slowly pipette droplets into one column of 96-Well Semi-Skirted PCR plate. Do not go back to cartridge and re-pipette potentially remaining droplets; these droplets will become sheared and will affect downstream analysis.Repeat steps 18-24 as needed to fill the 96-well plate.Place a piece of sealing foil, glue side down, on top of the plate. Seal plate with pre-heated PCR plate sealer at 180 °C.PCR Use a thermocycler with the ability to set a 50% ramping speed (2-3 °C/sec) and has a heated lid. The chemistry of droplets requires a lower ramping speed to properly come to temperature for PCR reaction.Run the following thermocycler program: table:",

    "When program is complete, store plate containing droplets at 4 °C for no more than 24 h or read immediately in Bio-Rad droplet reader.AnalysisTemplate copies per sample are computed by averaging over all available replicate wells. Total cellular input is measured by halving the estimated number of RPP30 copies. Copy numbers of gag (or pol) or 2-LTR can be normalized to one million PBMCs as determined by RPP30 (total cell count) or to one million CD4 T cells (as determined by the percentage of CD4 T cells as measured by flow cytometry and multiplied by total cell count). CMV and EBV can be normalized to one million PBMCs as determined by RPP30 (total cell count).Quantification of cell associated HIV RNA (unspliced and multiply spliced) by ddPCR We recommend running both unspliced (gag) and multiply spliced (Tat-Rev) RNA in a multiplex format. Poly-A, which quantifies fully elongated and correctly processed HIV-1 mRNA, should be run alone, not multiplexed. All RNA samples can be run in duplicate. The protocol below describes reagents needed for a single PCR reaction: Scale up to the number of replicates x1.5 to account for sample loss due to pipetting. For example, if running duplicates, prepare 3 reactions. Preparing RNA samples by reverse transcriptionDetermine the concentration of RNA (obtained from step A17 from section A) within samples to be tested by spectrophotometry (Nanodrop).

For HIV DNA, we normalize data to million of PBMCs or CD4:First, we calculate the number of PBMCs per well, using RPP30 results:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150604/20150604055325_3325.jpgThen, for each transcript we calculate the copies per million PBMCsimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150604/20150604055410_9470.jpgWe can also normalize to one million CD4 T cells:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150604/20150604055538_2603.jpgIn equation (2), each percentage refers to the fraction positive for that marker within the prior cell population. Thus %CD45+ is the fraction within all PBMCs, %CD3+ is the fraction within all CD45+ cells, and %CD4 is measured among CD3+ cells. If cells are stained for these three markers, the percentages can be obtained by sequential gating on CD45→CD3→CD4. Note that, for clinical samples, the %CD45+ is frequently unavailable. To allow accurate normalization to CD4 cells number, three-color flow cytometry should be performed directly. For HIV RNA Normalization for RNA is controversial. Since RNA expression may vary across cell types, disease stage, ART status, activation status, and other clinical variables, the use of a housekeeping gene is not routinely recommended for normalization of RNA in clinical samples. Here, we propose two alternative approaches for normalization of cellular HIV RNA, using RNA input, or using number of input cells (as measured by cell count or by RPP30 in the DNA fraction). First, we need to calculate the total copies per well:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150604/20150604060029_2476.jpgData can be normalized to: Total RNAFirst, we need to calculate the amount of cDNA that we add to the reaction:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150604/20150604060121_3205.jpgThen, we normalize to 100 ng of RNAimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20150604/20150604060222_5662.jpgMillion of PBMCs First, we need to calculate how many PBMCs are in the aliquot before extraction.

If confidence intervals are desired, the same calculations can be duplicated for the values computed by the Bio-Rad software for the upper and lower confidence bound in copies / µl. This method typically provides a good estimate, because the cDNA copy number measurement is usually the greatest source of uncertainty among all the quantities used in these calculations.Calculator template for HIV DNA and RNA (enclosed[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20150604/20150604060904_2514.xlsx])"
