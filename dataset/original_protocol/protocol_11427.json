    "The isolation process has been approved by the local ethics committee of the University Medical Center Erlangen (#159_15 B, TuMiC-study). Patient inclusion criteria were as follows: CRC, UICC stage I-IV, no history of inflammatory bowel disease, and no neoadjuvant treatment.\n1. Surgery and Preparation of Tissue for Single Cell Isolation\nObtain specimen by surgery from a CRC patient (carcinoma tissue >0.5 g, central non-necrotic tumor; normal colon tissue >10 cm distant from tumor site).\nThe obtained tissue pieces are mostly <1 g for the carcinoma, but >1 g for the normal colon. If pieces >1 g are obtained, split them into multiple 1 g pieces using a fresh scalpel for further tissue processing.\n\tNOTE: If the tumor tissue piece is below 0.5 g from the onset, the isolation usually fails.\nCollect fresh unfixed tissue pieces using sterile forceps in 40 mL of ice cold Hanks balanced salt solution (HBSS) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin/amphothericin B (1% HBSS-pen/strep/ampho) in 50-mL centrifuge tubes and transfer them quickly to the laboratory.\n\t​NOTE: Colon tissue is frequently highly contaminated with bacteria/fungi from the onset. During the whole procedure of isolation, pen/strep/ampho must be added to all solutions in order to eliminate contaminating organisms.\nWash each tissue piece at least 4 times with 40 mL ice cold HBSS-pen/strep/ampho (see step 1.3) in 50-mL centrifuge tubes by transferring the tissue pieces sequentially from one centrifuge tube to the next tube using sterile forceps.\n\t\nClean forceps after each step with 70% ethanol.\nUse separate forceps for the carcinoma and normal colon tissue pieces.\nWeigh all tissue pieces.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not put tissue pieces directly on a scale for weighing. After washing, weigh the last centrifuge tube containing the tissue before and after entering the tissue pieces. Calculate the weight of individual tissue pieces by subtraction.",
    "2. Generation of Single Cell Suspension\nNote: It is recommended to keep the tissue moisturized at all times.\nIf it exists, remove attached fat, other non-tumorous tissue, or potentially necrotic tissue parts from the surgery specimen by transferring the tissue pieces in a sterile cell culture petri dish using sterile forceps.\n\t\nKeep the tissue pieces moisturized at all times by adding 3-5 mL of HBSS-pen/strep/ampho.\nTrim the tissue pieces using a fresh sterile scalpel (Figure 1). Consult a pathologist in case tissue identification is unclear.\nMince remaining tissue into small pieces (approximately 2 × 2 × 2 mm3) using a fresh scalpel with a curved blade. Transfer tissue pieces with sterile forceps into tissue dissociation tubes (for example, gentleMACS C tubes) pre-filled with pre-warmed (37 °C) cell culture medium (Dulbecco´s modified eagle medium [DMEM] basal medium) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\tNOTE: Try to use the scalpel like a rocking tool. Do not squeeze the cells in order to avoid tissue damage.\nDigest/dissociate tissue pieces using a tissue dissociator (like gentleMACS Octo Dissociator) in combination with the tumor dissociation kit for human tissue using the program \"37C_h_TDK_1\" following the manufacturer´s instructions.\nCentrifuge dissociation tubes for 1 min at 300 x g at room temperature (RT).\nAdd 10 mL of pre-warmed (37 °C) DMEM supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (DMEM-Low) to each tube using a serological pipette and filter the cell suspension using a cell strainer (100 µm pore size) on top of a 50-mL centrifuge tube by pipetting the cell suspension on top of the filter.\nAdd 10 mL of DMEM-Low again to each MACS-tube by a serological pipette and transfer remaining cells to the cell strainer on top of the 50-mL centrifuge tube.",
    "Wash the cell strainer once with an additional 10 mL of DMEM-Low medium using a serological pipette.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 7 min at 300 x g at RT and discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 5 mL of pre-warmed endothelial basal medium (EBM)-2-microvascular (MV) medium (Lonza) supplemented with pen/strep/ampho in the same 50-mL centrifuge tube.\nPlate cell suspension in a T-25 cell culture flask pre-coated overnight with 1.5% gelatin-phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\nIncubate cells for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2, wash the cells two times carefully with approximately 5 mL of PBS, and add 5 mL of fresh medium.\nCultivate the cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 until 80-90% confluency (usually 5 - 7 days) with 48 h intervals of medium renewal.\n3. FACS-sorting of Endothelial Cells\nNOTE: Try to avoid losing cells at any point, e.g. by limiting the staining procedure to incubation of the cells in a single reagent tube.\nDetach cells with 1 mL of accutase (approximately 10 min), and add 4 mL of pre-warmed (37 °C) EBM-2-MV medium.\nDetermine cell count using an automated cell counting device (range 10 - 25 µm).\nCentrifuge cell suspension for 4 min with 250 x g at RT and discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells in pre-warmed FACS-buffer (1x PBS, 2.5% bovine serum albumin [BSA], 5 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 10 µM Y-27632) according to cell count (5 x 106/mL).\nAdd FACS-staining antibodies according to cell count/FACS-buffer volume: CD31-FITC (100 µL/mL =1/10), CD144/vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin-PE (100 µL/mL = 1/10), CD105-APC (25 µL/mL = 1/40), mix and incubate for 7 min at RT protected from light; gently flick and incubate for another 8 min (for a total incubation time of 15 min).",
    "Add 2 mL of FACS-buffer to the labeled cell suspension using a serological pipette.\nCentrifuge for 4 min with 250 x g at RT and discard supernatant.\nWash two times by adding 2 mL of FACS-buffer, and conduct a subsequent centrifugation for 4 min at 250 x g at RT and discard supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 500 µL of pre-warmed EBM-2-MV-pen/strep/ampho and transfer cells to the FACS-sorting instrument.\n\t\nEndothelial cells will quickly die during the sorting process if the FACS-instrument is cooled. Therefore, carry out sorting of endothelial cells at RT and immediately transfer the collected cells to the 37 °C incubator afterwards.\n\t\tNOTE: The FACS-instrument is usually unsterile!\nSort/collect triple-positive cells directly into a cell culture dish (e.g., 24-well plate pre-coated overnight with 1.5% gelatin-PBS) filled with 0.5 mL of pre-warmed fresh medium (EBM-2-MV-pen/strep/ampho).\n\tNOTE: Check cell suspension after sorting using a microscope. If the cells cluster together, try to obtain an even cell distribution in the cell culture dish by mixing them slowly or adding medium.\nCultivate cells until 90 - 100% confluency with 48 h intervals of medium renewal and expand the cells to the desired culture dish size (24-well plate → 12 well-plate → 3.5 cm dish → T-25 → T-75).\n4. Harvest and Characterization of Pure Endothelial Cells\nHarvest cells at 90 - 100% confluency and characterize them by an appropriate method (e.g., FACS, cytochemistry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), or endothelial cell function assays7,8).\nAnalyze isolated cells with whichever characterization method is chosen."
