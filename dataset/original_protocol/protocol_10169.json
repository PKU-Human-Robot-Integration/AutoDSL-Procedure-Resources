    "1. Creating a Dilution Library\nLabel 625 Dilution Library plates by hand, ensuring that they match to their corresponding plate from the chemical library. Additionally, connect in flow and out flow hoses to the Multichannel Tip Wash Automated Labware Positioner (ALP) by passing them through the Console Drive to the 5 Gallon Reservoir (see Table of Materials).\nAccess the computer and turn on the wash pump through the connection of the Device Controller to the Multichannel Tip Wash ALP in order to circulate water. This will turn off automatically at the end of the protocol.\nLoad, by hand, the Stacker 10's attached to the Stacker Carousel, in the following order in Hotels A - D (Figure 4, Stacker); one box of AP96 P20 Pipette Tips in Room 1, four 96-Well V-Bottom Plates in Rooms 2 - 5 with the two upper plates containing stock concentrations from the ordered library and the two lower plates empty (Figure 5, Stacker). Additionally, load one box of AP96 P20 Pipette Tips in Room 6, and four 96-Well V-Bottom Plates in Rooms 7 - 9 with the two upper plates containing stock concentrations of the ordered library and the two lower plates empty (Figure 5, Stacker).\nSet up, by hand, the deck with a 300 mL water reservoir on P3, a 300 mL 70% EtOH bath on P7, Tip Loader ALP (TL1), and Multichannel Tip Wash ALP (TW1) (Figure 4, Deck and Figure 5, Deck).\nUsing the operating software, present AP96 P20 Pipette Tips from the Stacker 10 and move them to the Tip Loader ALP.\n\tNOTE: 1.5 through 1.12 all are done with the liquid handling robot's operating software; see Table of Materials.",
    "Present Room 2 from Hotel A and separate all four 96-Well V-Bottom Plates on the deck, placing the bottom two on P4 and P8 and the top two on P5 and P9 (Figure 4).\nLoad AP96 P20 Pipette Tips with the Tip Loader ALP onto the 96-Channel 200 µL Head. Aspirate 90 µL from the 300 mL water reservoir and dispense into the 96-Well V-Bottom Dilution Plate on P4. Repeat this step for the plate on P8.\nMix the chemical library plate on P5 by repetitively aspirating and dispensing 15 µL three times. Additionally, aspirate 10 µL from the chemical library plate on P5 and dispense 10 µL into the dilution plate on P4.\nMix the solutions of the plate on P4 by repetitively aspirating and dispensing 50 µL a total of three times. Once mixed, clean the AP96 P20 Pipette Tips by aspirating and dispensing 70 µL of 70% EtOH from P7, then washing them in the Multichannel Tip Wash ALP by aspirating and dispensing a 110% volume of water four times.\nRepeat steps 1.8 - 1.9 for the second pair of plates on P8 and P9. Upon creating the second 96-Well V-Bottom Dilution Plate, stack the plates in the following order from bottom to top: P9, P5, P8, and P4. Then, place the stack on one empty Static ALP; either P1, P2, P6, P10, P11, P12, or P13.\nRepeat steps 1.6 - 1.10 until Room 5 in Hotel A is empty. Repeat step 1.5 upon reaching Room 6, moving new AP96 P20 Pipette Tips to the Tip Loader ALP and placing the used AP96 P20 Pipette Tips on an empty Static ALP.",
    "Repeat steps 1.6 - 1.10 until Room 9 of Hotel A is empty. However, in order to proceed to Hotel B, the plates and tips on the deck must be reloaded into Hotel A.\nRe-fill, by hand, the 300 mL water reservoir. This step is crucial, and the computer program can incorporate a pause detailing this message, requiring the user to hit 'continue', before carrying out the next step.\nRepeat steps 1.5 - 1.13 for the remaining hotels, ensuring a full 300 mL water reservoir each time prior to proceeding to the next hotel.\n2. Adding Media-seed Mixture to Screening Plates\nMake ½ Murashige and Skoog (MS) Media with 0.1% Agar by the addition of 4.3 g MS Salts, 0.50 g MES, 1.0 g Agar to 1 L DI H2O. Adjust the pH to 5.7 though the addition of 5 M potassium hydroxide while monitoring with a pH probe.\nSterilize seeds by shaking them in 1% bleach and SDS between 15 and 30 min, and then rinse 4 times with an equal volume of water by centrifugation. Once seeds are sterile, place them at 4 °C from 24 hours to 7 days for vernilization. The Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center describes additional methods of sterilization, vernilization, and growth22.\nAdd seeds to media by hand at a density of 0.1 g/100 mL. This density results in an average of 3 - 10 seeds per well of a 96-well plate.",
    "Place, by hand, four 96-Well Flat-Bottom Plates in Rooms 1 and 2 of Hotel A (Figure 6, Hotel A). Place a box of AP96 P250 Pipette Tips on the Tip Loader ALP, a 300 mL reservoir filled with the media-seed mixture created in steps 2.1 - 2.3 on P3, and a 300 mL reservoir filled with 70% EtOH on P7 (Figure 4, Deck and Figure 6, Deck).\n\tNOTE: 2.5 through 2.8 are done with the operating software.\nPresent Rooms 1 and 2 in Hotel A, and separate the stacks of four plates. Place one plate on each of the empty static ALPs (P4, P5, P6, P8, P9, P10, P11, and P12). Load AP96 P250 Pipette Tips on the 96-Channel 200 µL Head.\nAspirate 90 µL from the 300 mL media-seed reservoir on P3 and dispense into the first 96-Well Flat-Bottom Plate. Repeat this process until all eight plates contain the media-seed mixture.\nClean the AP96 P250 Pipette Tips by aspirating and dispensing 70 µL from the 300 mL reservoir filled with 70% EtOH on P7. Wash the tips in the Multichannel Tip Wash ALP by aspirating and dispensing a 110% volume of water four times, unload the tips at TL1, and gather the plates by hand.\n3. Adding Small Molecules to Screening Plates\nLoad, by hand, a box of AP96 P250 Pipette Tips into Room 1 of Hotel A, two 96-Well V-Bottom Dilution Library Plates into Rooms 2, 4, 6, and 8, and two 96 Well Flat-Bottom Screening Plates into Rooms 3, 5, 7, and 9 (Figure 4, Stacker and Figure 7, Hotel A). Additionally, connect hoses to and from the Multichannel Tip Wash ALP to the 5 Gallon Reservoir.\n\tNOTE: 3.2 through 3.10 are done with the operating software.",
    "Configure the deck to contain a 300 mL 70% EtOH wash reservoir at P7; the media-seed reservoir can be left on the deck at P3 (Figure 4, Deck and Figure 7, Deck). Additionally, turn on the Console Drive through connection of the Device Controller to circulate water through the Multichannel Tip Wash ALP. This will turn off automatically at the end of the protocol.\nPresent the AP96 P250 Pipette Tip Box from Hotel A and move it to the Tip Loader ALP.\nPresent the 96-Well V-Bottom Dilution Library Plates from Room 2 of Hotel A to the deck and place one on Static ALP P4 and one on P8. Present the 96-Well Flat-Bottom Screening Plates from room 3 of Hotel A to the deck and place one on Static ALP P5 and one on P9.\nLoad AP96 P250 Pipette Tips with the Tip Loader ALP onto the 96-Channel 200 µL Head.\nMix the 96-Well V-Bottom Dilution Plate on P4 by aspirating and dispensing 50 µL three times. Following that, aspirate 10 µL from this plate and dispense into the 96-Well Flat-Bottom Screening Plate on P5.\nMix the solutions in the plate at P5 by aspirating and dispensing 50 µL three times. Clean the AP96 P250 Pipette Tips with ethanol by aspirating and dispensing 70 µL of 70% EtOH from the reservoir at P7 and then wash the tips in the Multichannel Tip Wash ALP by aspirating and dispensing a 110% volume of water four times.\nRepeat steps 3.5 and 3.6 for the second 96-Well V-Bottom Dilution Library Plate (P8) and 96-Well Flat-Bottom Screening Plate (P9).\nStack the two 96-Well V-Bottom Dilution Library Plates together and the two 96-Well Flat Bottom Screening Plates together. Move the plates to Static ALPs P1, P2, P6, P10, P11, P12, or P13.",
    "Repeat steps 3.4 - 3.9 three times, adding diluted chemicals to screening plates a total of eight times. Finally, check the number of seeds in each well of the screening plates through visual conformation and supplement those wells with fewer than three seeds by additional sterilized and vernalized seed.\n4. Incubation and Visualization of Screening Plates\nIncubate the 96-well Flat-Bottom Screening Plates for four days in an environmental chamber at 22 °C on a 16/8 light/dark cycle in a desiccation proof container. Visualize the 96-well Flat-Bottom Screening Plates under a dissecting microscope. Record all aberrant phenotypes for further investigation.\nSubscription Required.
