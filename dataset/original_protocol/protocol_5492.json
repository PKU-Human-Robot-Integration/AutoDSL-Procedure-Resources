    "Note: Athymic nude mice were purchased from the Jackson’s Laboratory, breeding, husbandry, and surgical procedures were in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were approved by the Central South University or/and by University of Louisville Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). Preparation of UM cellsDr. Klara Valyi-Nagy in the University of Illinois at Chicago generously provided the human UM cell line OCM1.The OCM1 cells are cultured in the medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium [DMEM] with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum [FBS], 100 U/ml penicillin and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, see Recipes) in a 37 °C and 5% CO2 incubator.Cells are passaged at 1:3 ratio when confluent by trypsinization with enough 0.25% trypsin solution to cover cell culture plate surface after removal of the culture medium and rinsing of cells twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).Trypsin is inactivated by adding the culture medium. Add twice the amount of the medium than trypsin solution used above.The trypsinized cells are transferred to a 15-ml tube, centrifuged at 500 x g at 4 °C for 5 min, and resuspended in PBS to make a final concentration of 5 x 104 cells/μl.If not used immediately, cells can be resuspended in a cryopreservation medium (the above culture medium with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, see Recipes) at the concentration of 1 x 106 cells/ml, and then stored in a -80 °C freezer for short-term storage (< one month) or in a liquid nitrogen tank for long-term storage (> one month).Instrument sterilizationPrepare a 30 G blunt needle and a 5-µl syringe, place them into a 50-ml beaker with 30 ml of distilled water and boil for 30 min.",
    "Prepare forceps and scissors, clean the instruments with running water for 5 min, disinfect all the instruments in an autoclave with a standard program (121 °C for 20 min).Prepare cotton swabs, 30 G needles, mydriatic eye drops, Povidone-Iodine and erythromycin eye ointment, glass coverslips.Place a sterilized diaper underneath a surgical microscope or any binocular scope, establish and maintain a sterile field to minimize possible contamination.The operator should wear head cover, mask and sterilized gloves before the operation.Preparation of anesthesia and positioning of the animalPrepare 6-week-old athymic nude mice, by weighing all mice individually to ensure accurate medication dosage for each of them.Give an intraperitoneal (IP) anesthesia shot with a 27 G needle and a 1-ml syringe containing a mixture of 100 mg of ketamine and 10 mg of xylazine per kg of the body weight.Monitor the effectiveness of the anesthesia until the animal completely falls to sleep prior to following procedure.Give a drop of mydriatic eye drop to dilate the pupil.Trim eye lashes with a pair of scissors (with some ophthalmic ointment on the blades).Give 2 drops of Povidone-Iodine to disinfect the eyes.Give a drop of eye lubricant drop to moisture the eyes.Place the animal on the diaper and let it lay on one side to facilitate the operation.Intravitreal injection of tumor cell (see Video 1)Put a sterilized glass coverslip on the eyeball and focalize the surgical microscope to see the fundus clearly.Use a 30 G needle to poke a hole about 1 mm behind the limbus.Before injection, use a 200-μl tip to pipet up and down to ensure a single-cell suspension.Use Hamilton microliter syringe to inject 2 μl of the above prepared cells into the vitreous, and place the needle posteriorly to avoid touching the lens to avoid cataract formation.",
    "Press a cotton swab on the incision for 1 min and cover the eye with erythromycin ointment to stop possible bleeding after the injection.Inject 2 µl of PBS in the same way into the other eye as a shamed control.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Resuspending pellet in buffer I or buffer II: Gently rotate bottles in an ice-bucket to resuspend the bacterial pellet in buffer Animal care after the operationKeep the grafted mice on a warm pad, check their respiration and activity hourly until they revive.Keep the mice under specific-pathogen-free condition, maintain the warmth, ventilation and clean the cage as usual.Check the wound and add ointment daily (while under anesthesia) for the next 5 days to prevent infection.Give 0.1 ml of Meloxicam at 5 mg/ml subcutaneously per 0.25 kg of body weight daily for at least 2 days to reduce wound pain.Tumor growth assessmentPrepare intraperitoneal anesthesia with 1-ml syringe and 27 G needle containing a mixture of 100 mg of ketamine and 10 mg of xylazine per kg of the body weight.Use a drop of mydriatic eye drop to dilate the pupil.Put the animal to lay on one side.Give a drop of eye lubricant drop and place a glass coverslip on the eyeball.Place the animal under the surgical microscope or check the fundus with an indirect ophthalmoscope. The tumor size is estimated in relation to the entire vitreous cavity.Potential metastasis assessmentEuthanize the mice 4 weeks later by CO2 inhalation followed by a cervical dislocation.Isolate the eye, liver, lung, and kidney for paraffin-embedded sections to check formation of primary tumor and metastasis by histology haemotoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.Tumor dissection and histologyPut all collected tissues in 10% neutral buffered formalin and then in 70% ethanol until further processing for embedding in paraffin.Section the tissues at 10-μm for histopathological and immunostaining analyses."
