    "A schematic diagram of the protocol overview is presented in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4711/bioprotoc-13-13-4711-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic diagram of the protocol overview Mouse tracheal dissection Euthanize pregnant mice at E11.5–E16.5 by CO2 exposure, consistent with institutional ethical guidelines and approved protocols. Place one mouse in a CO2 chamber and gradually fill CO2 at a flow rate of 20% of the chamber volume per minute. Keep the animal in the chamber for 4 min and maintain gas flow for an additional 2 min after apparent clinical death. Perform cervical dislocation following CO2 treatment (Figure 1).Isolate embryos from euthanized animals. Clean and sterilize the abdomen with 70% ethanol. Perform laparotomy using surgical scissors and forceps. Transfer the uterus and keep it in ice-cold HBSS in a 10 cm Petri dish. Open the uterus and transfer embryos to a new dish containing ice-cold HBSS (Supplementary Figure 1).Dissect the trachea and lungs from the embryo under the stereoscopic dissecting microscope. For embryonic mice, it is best to start dissection from the abdominal cavity so as not to damage the trachea and lungs in the thoracic cavity. Fix the head and forelimb, remove the skin, carefully open the abdominal cavity not to damage the trachea and lungs, and remove the heart using scissors and forceps. Separate the trachea and lungs from the embryo and trim away the esophagus using forceps. The trachea is cut above the larynx to ensure its integrity. The esophagus is dissected behind the trachea and down from the larynx with two tiny forceps. Transfer the trachea and lungs to a 24-well plate containing ice-cold PBS using a 1 mL pipette to ensure tissue integrity (Supplementary Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 2).Whole-mount immunostaining and imaging The mouse embryonic trachea is tiny.",
    "To avoid sucking it away in washing procedures, we perform whole-mount immunostaining using the whole trachea and lungs and suck out washing buffer when tissues sink to the bottom of the tube. Fix E11.5–E16.5 tracheas and lungs in DMSO:methanol (1:4) (see Recipes) overnight at 4 °C. Incubate samples in H2O2/DMSO/methanol (1:1:4) (see Recipes) for 5 h at room temperature (RT). The purpose of soaking the tissue in a fixative containing hydrogen peroxide is to remove endogenous catalase.Wash samples twice in 100% methanol for 1 h each, once in 80% methanol for 1 h, once in 50% methanol for 1 h, twice in PBS for 1 h each, and twice in 5% FBS/PBS/0.5% Triton X-100/3% BSA (see Recipes) for 1 h each.Incubate tracheas and lungs in primary antibodies diluted in 5% FBS/PBS/0.5% Triton X-100/3% BSA (SOX9, 1:400; αSMA-Cy3, 1:200; GM130, 1:50) for 24 h at 4 °C. Wash samples five times in 5% FBS/PBS/0.5% Triton X-100/3% BSA for 1 h each at 4 °C.Incubate samples in secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, 1:1,000; Alexa Fluor 647, 1:1,000; DAPI, 1:2,000) for 24 h at 4 °C. Wash samples five times in 5% FBS/PBS/0.5% Triton X-100/3% BSA for 1 h each at 4 °C.Dehydrate samples in methanol for 6 h (incomplete dehydration may result in tissue disintegration), and then clear samples in BABB (1:2) (see Recipes) for 24 h.Mount samples in BABB and seal the edges of the cover glass completely with nail polish.After whole-mount immunostaining, tissues are transferred to the microscope for imaging. The position of the trachea is gently adjusted with a pipette as follows: throat and upper trachea in the anterior direction, lower trachea in the posterior direction, cartilage in the upward direction, and SM in the downward direction to obtain a dorsal and ventral view.",
    "Acquire images of tracheal SM and cartilage rings in an anterior–posterior direction with a laser scanning confocal microscope by using a 20× objective and a stereomicroscope with a fluorescence mode by using a 2.5× objective, respectively. Take 10–15 images for whole-mount immunostaining. Take one image for section immunostaining (Figure 1; Figure 2A, 2C, 2E, 2G; Figure 5A–5D).Immunostaining of sections and imaging Fix E11.5–E14.5 tracheas and lungs in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C. Incubate samples in 10% and 30% sucrose for 24 h each at 4 °C.Mount samples in OCT embedding compound. Make transverse sections of the trachea at 10 µm.Fix sections in 4% PFA for 10 min at 4 °C. Incubate samples in permeabilization solution (0.25%Triton X-100/PBS) (see Recipes) for 15 min at RT and in blocking solution (5% FBS/PBS/3% BSA) for 1 h at RT.Incubate samples in primary antibodies (αSMA-Cy3, 1:1,000; CDH1, 1:200, or SOX9, 1:400) overnight at 4 °C. Wash samples three times in 5% FBS/PBS/0.5% Triton X-100/3% BSA for 10 min each at RT.Incubate samples in secondary antibodies [Alexa FluorTM 568 goat anti-rat IgG (H+L), 1:1,000 or Alexa FluorTM 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), 1:1,000] for 2 h at RT. Wash samples three times in 5% FBS/PBS/0.5% Triton X-100/3% BSA for 10 min each at RT.Perform DAPI counterstaining (1:2,000) for 5 min at RT. Wash samples three times in 5% FBS/PBS/0.5% Triton X-100/3% BSA for 10 min each at RT.Mount samples with Mowiol mounting medium. Acquire images using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Figure 1; Figure 4A, 4C, 4E, and Figure 5E).Quantification of SM cell alignment Select the whole area of the imaged tracheal SM.Draw a horizontal line and then a line along the extension of a SM cell using the angle tool in ImageJ. Select the menu Analyze and click the button Measure.",
    "Record the value of the angle for each SM cell.For an individual trachea, measure the value of the angle for 50 SM cells. Quantify six tracheas. Count the number of SM cells in each defined angle value range (-90° to -30°, -30° to 0°, 0° to 30°, 30° to 90°). Calculate the ratio of SM cells (Figure 2).Note: Distribution of SM cell alignment is reflected by the percentage of SM cells in the defined angle value range. Quantification of SM cell polarity Select the whole area of the imaged tracheal SM.The Golgi apparatus for polarity analysis has been used in airway SM cells and vascular endothelial cells (Kwon et al., 2016; Yin et al., 2018). Draw a horizontal line to the middle of the SM cell nucleus and then a line to the GM130-labeled Golgi using the angle tool in ImageJ. Select the menu Analyze and click the button Measure. Record the value of angle for each SM cell.For an individual trachea, measure the value of the angle for 50 SM cells. Quantify six tracheas. Count the number of SM cells in each defined angle value range (-135° to -45°, -45° to 45°, 45° to 135°, 135° to -135°) (Chen et al., 2015). Calculate the ratio of SM cells (Figure 3).Note: Distribution of SM cell polarity is reflected by the percentage of SM cells in the defined angle value range. Quantification of SM cell nuclear aspect ratio (NAR) Select the whole area of the imaged tracheal SM.Draw a line along the horizontal dimension of the SM cell nucleus using Straight Line in ImageJ and assign it as the length 2a.

Record the value of length (Supplementary Figure 3).Calculate the value of NAR using the equation:NAR = a/bFor an individual trachea, calculate the value of NAR for 50 SM cells. Quantify six tracheas. Count the number of SM cells in each defined NAR range (0–1.0, 1.0–2.0, 2.0–3.0, 3.0–4.0).
