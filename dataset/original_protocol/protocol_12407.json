    "Figure 3 shows a summary of the experimental procedure.\n1. Tissue Preparation\nTo determine the consequences of modified expression of a gene of interest, set up the following cross in duplicate and maintain at 25 °C: UAS-transgene (males)X GMR-GAL4; UAS-α-cat:GFP, ubi-DE-Cad:GFP ; + / SM5-TM6b (virgin females) NOTE: To obtain control tissue cross UAS-lacZ males to GMR-GAL4; UAS-α-cat:GFP, ubi-DE-Cad:GFP females. β-Galactosidase generates no defects in cell behavior in the retina.\nTo enhance efficacy of RNAi transgenes, cross UAS-RNAi males to GMR-GAL4, UAS-Dcr-2; UAS-α-cat:GFP, ubi-DE-Cad:GFP; + / SM5-TM6b virgin females.\n\tNOTE: Occasional defects in cell behavior in retinae expressing ectopic Dcr-2 have been observed (data not shown). Vigilance is recommended if using this approach.\nSelect white pre-pupae of appropriate genotypes and place in 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. If the pupae express Dcr-2, select either male or female pupae: expression of UAS-Dcr-2, an insert on the X chromosome, is stronger in males. Pupae should be sexed at 0 hr APF before pigmentation of the pupal case – the gonads of males are visible as large translucent globes on the lateral sides of the pupa (approximately one-third from the posterior).\nIncubate microcentrifuge tubes containing pupae, in a clean plastic tip-box at 25 °C. To prevent desiccation of pupae place a 10 cm2 piece of tissue, soaked in distilled water, into the tip-box.\n\tNOTE: if the humidity in the tip-box becomes too high the pupal case may become soggy and difficult to dissect in subsequent steps.\nIncubate for appropriate time. To capture cell behaviors associated with patterning the eye, prepare pupae for imaging at around 17 hr APF, 20 hr APF or 24 hr APF. See Representative Results for further discussion on when specific cell behaviors are best observed.",
    "Place a piece of fresh double-sided tape onto a black sylgard dissection dish. Position a pupa, dorsal side up, with the head of the pupa adhered to the double-sided tape (Figure 1A).Try not to adhere the thoracic and abdominal regions of the pupa to the double-sided tape. With forceps carefully lift and remove the operculum to expose the pupal head. Tear along the side of the pupal case to expose the area around one eye.\nGently remove the pupa from the adhesive tape. If the pupa remains adherent, apply a small volume of distilled water to the junction between the pupal case and tape to weaken adhesion.\n2. Mounting\nConstruct a small 15 mm2 frame from blotting paper and punch a hole in the middlethat is 5.5 mm in diameter (Figure 1B). Immerse in distilled water and place in the center of a microscope slide. Using a 30 cc syringe, squeeze out a uniform ring of petroleum jelly to surround the blotting paper frame. Ensure that the petroleum jelly ring is marginally higher than the width of the pupa and that the diameter of the ring is marginally less than the width of a cover slip.\nAdd a small bead of petroleum jelly directly onto the slide, in the hole punched into the blotting paper(Figure 1C).Carefully arrange the pupa, on its side, supported by the petroleum jelly bead (Figure 1D).\nPlace a coverslip on top of the petroleum jelly ring so that it contacts the epithelium above the eye neuroepithelium (Figure 1D). Gently compress the preparation to seal the coverslip against the petroleum jelly and generate a small flat contact surface between the pupal eye region and the coverslip.\n3. Fluorescence Imaging",
    "Image the pupal preparation using a fluorescent microscope. Every 7 min capture serial sections through the apical domain of the eye neuroepithelium, in the region of the adherens junctions.\n\tNOTE: a) Appropriate serial sections are usually 4-5 per z-stack comprised of 0.2 μm z-steps. b) Irregularities in the topology of the epithelium, including mild bumps and folds, may make it challenging to acquire in-focus images of large regions of tissue. While imaging, one may find part of an area of interest to be in-focus, and a neighboring region to be out-of-focus. Including a small droplet of distilled water between the pupal eye and coverslip can eliminate some acute tissue folds but not the mildly uneven topology characteristic of the early stages of pupal eye morphogenesis. In these instances oversample the tissue by extending the z-stack until in-focus slices are acquired for the entire field. c) Capturing serial sections every 7 min should enable live-imaging for 3 to 4 hr without a significant reduction in the intensity of GFP fluorescence that may compromise image quality. Shorter time-intervals may reduce the total time of imaging.\nContinue imaging for 3 to 4 hr. Do not use an automatic focus and time function that is available on many fluorescent microscopes since pupal growth and pumping of the hemolymph moves the position of the retina and vigilant re-focusing is required every 14-21 min. NOTE that imaging beyond 4 hours may slow or stall morphogenesis of the eye.\nUse appropriate deconvolution software to reduce background and enhance contrast of the serial section images. For each z-stack file, perform the following in LAS AF software (see Table of Materials): Navigate to the Tools panel, select 3D Deconvolution and click Apply.",
    "Generate a maximum projection (MP) image for each deconvoluted stack file: Navigate to the Tools panel, select 3D Projection and click Apply.\n\tNOTE: The Maximum Projection algorithm may fail to generate a uniformly in-focus image for tissue that has been oversampled. A technique for sharpening out-of-focus regions is outlined in step 5.2.\n4. Post-imaging Pupal Rescue and Phenotype Verification\nTo address whether artifacts were introduced or the pupa harmed during imaging, carefully remove the pupa from the imaging rig: using forceps remove the coverslip and transfer the pupa to a clean vial of food. Store at room temperature or 25 °C until the adult fly emerges.\nCarefully examine the phenotype of the adult eye and compare to the eyes of adult flies emerging from the original fly cross.\n5. Image Processing\nAutomatic Image Alignment:\n\tNOTE: The live Drosophila tissue will shift and grow throughout the imaging process. Consequently, the centers of images gathered at successive time points may not correspond to the same point in the Drosophila tissue. In addition the entire retinal disc rotates about 30° between ~21 and 23 hr APF. To highlight individual cell behaviors and reduce distractions caused by organismal growth,align each MP image.While this can be performed manually,the image editing software used here (see Table of Materials) has built-in algorithms that can expedite the process.\n\t\nFrom the File tab of the main menu, open Scripts and select Load Files into Stack.\nImport the MP image files into the Load Layers panel and select OK. Make sure that the Attempt to Automatically Align Source Images option is not selected.\n\t\tNOTE: If this option is selected, the software may use an alignment algorithm that distorts the image data.",
    "Once all MP files have loaded into the Layers pane, make sure that all images are in chronological order such that the earliest time point is at the top of the layer stack. If the layers are not in the correct order, drag and drop them until they are ordered correctly.\nSelect Auto-Align Layers from the Edit tab of the main menu. Choose Reposition and click OK.\nIf the Auto-Align algorithm fails to orient the frames to a relevant focal point, make minor adjustments using the Move tool.\nComposite Sharpening:\n\tNOTE: Out-of-focus regions of an initial MP image can be sharpened by ‘cropping’ the corresponding deconvoluted stack in LAS AF software. Cropping a stack file allows one to manually restrict the interval of a z-stack that is subjected to the Maximum Projection algorithm.\n\t\nLocate the Crop function in the Tools panel (under the Process tab). Manually restrict the initial and final slices such that they span only the adhesion belt within the initially out-of-focus region. Click Apply to generate a new stack file that is optimized for this region.\nGenerate a new Maximum Projection for the locally optimized stack and export as a TIFF file.\nIn the image editing software (see Table of Materials), open Scripts (located in the File tab of the main menu) and select Load Files into Stack.\nImport the initial MP image file and locally optimized MP file for a particular time point into the Load Layers panel and select OK. Make sure that the Attempt to Automatically Align Source Images option is not selected.",
    "Select both layers in the Layers pane and then choose Auto-Blend Layers (located in the Edit tab of the main menu) to automatically mask the appropriate regions of the two images, yielding a uniformly in-focus retinal field. Save this composite image as a TIFF file.\nRepeat steps 5.2.1 through 5.2.5 for all suboptimal MP images.\nFurther Adjustments: Rotate, crop, and Adjust the Levels of the Movie Layers:\n\t\nWith all of the layers selected, use the Transform tool (Edit > Free Transform) to rotate the images so that the dorsal-ventral axis of the retina is aligned to the y-axis of the movie frame.\nIf necessary, use the Crop tool to reduce the field of view to a desired size and shape.\nUse level adjustment (of individual frames) to help enhance contrast between the cell membrane and cell body.\nFor stylistic purposes and to emphasize specific cell behaviors, introduce false color to highlight points of interest in each frame.\nAnimation: Convert the Images into a Movie:\n\t\nOpen the Animation pane from the Windows tab of the main menu. Select Make Frames from Layers from the menu located in the upper right hand corner of the Animation pane.\nNote that the layers are added to the animation pane in sequential order beginning from the bottom of the stack. To reverse the order of the frames, first select all of the frames and then select Reverse Frames from the Animation pane menu.\nSelect a frame delay time for each frame using the dropdown menu below the frame thumbnail.\n\t\tNOTE: The frame delay for Movies 1 to 4 presented in this paper is 0.8 sec.",
