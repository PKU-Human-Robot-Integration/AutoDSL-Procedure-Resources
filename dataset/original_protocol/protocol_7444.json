    "In this protocol, HeLa cells grown on two coverslips are prepared to study the intra-Golgi localization of giantin, GalT-mCherry, GM130, and GFP-OSBP by side-averaging. For coverslip #1, cells transiently expressing GalT-mCherry are immunostained for giantin and GM130 with fluorophores AF488 and AF647, respectively. For coverslip #2, cells transiently co-expressing GFP-OSBP and GalT-mCherry are immunostained for giantin with fluorophore AF647. Cells are imaged under a Zeiss Airyscan microscope.Prepare glass coverslip for cell culture Add 200 µL of DMEM to two wells in a 24-well plate: well #1 and #2.Wash two pieces of coverslip in 70% ethanol. Then, wipe them with Kimwipe® tissue and place them into the two DMEM-containing wells. Hence, the two pieces of coverslip are referred to as coverslip #1 and #2.Keep the 24-well plate in the 37 °C cell culture incubator until use.Seed HeLa cells onto the glass coverslip Maintain HeLa cells in a T25 flask with DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (complete medium) in the 37 °C cell culture incubator. Cells are sub-cultured at ~80% confluency.Aspirate the culture medium from the T25 flask and add 1 mL of 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA. Return the flask to the 37 °C cell culture incubator for 2 min.Add 3 mL of complete medium to the T25 flask, pipette several times to detach the cells, and collect the cells in a 15 mL centrifuge tube.Pellet cells by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min in a benchtop centrifuge.Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 5 mL of complete medium by pipetting.Aspirate the DMEM medium in wells #1 and #2. Add 0.4 mL of cell suspension (~1 × 105 cells) to the two wells and incubate in the 37 °C cell incubator.Cells are ready for transfection when they are ~80% confluent and well spread on the glass coverslip.",
    "Transfection to express GalT-mCherry and GFP-OSBP Change well #1 and #2 to 500 µL of fresh complete medium.Add 500 ng GalT-mCherry plasmid DNA to 50 µL of Opti-MEM. Add 1 µL of lipofectamine 2000 to 50 µL of Opti-MEM in a separate tube. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, mix the content of the two tubes and incubate the resulting mixture at room temperature for 20 min. Add the final mix to well #1.Note: Other transfection reagents should also be suitable to transfect HeLa cells. Add GalT-mCherry and GFP-OSBP plasmid DNA, 250 ng each, to 50 µL of Opti-MEM. Add 1 µL of lipofectamine 2000 to 50 µL of Opti-MEM in a separate tube. After 5 min incubation at room temperature, mix the content of the two tubes and incubate the resulting mixture at room temperature for 20 min. Add the final mix to well #2.Change well #1 and #2 to the fresh complete medium after 6 h incubation in the 37 °C cell culture incubator.Nocodazole treatment to induce Golgi ministacks Dilute the nocodazole stock solution 1,000-fold by pipetting 1 µL of stock solution into 1 mL of complete medium. The working concentration of nocodazole is 33 µM. Prewarm the nocodazole-containing complete medium to 37 °C.Aspirate the medium from wells #1 and #2 and add 500 µL of prewarmed nocodazole-containing complete medium.Incubate the 24-well plate for 3 h in the 37 °C cell culture incubator.Immunofluorescence labeling Note: Avoid intense ambient light to prevent fluorophores from photobleaching. FixationAspirate the nocodazole-containing complete medium from wells #1 and #2. Next, rinse cells with 0.5 mL of PBS twice and add 0.5 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde fixative solution. After 20 min incubation at room temperature, wash the wells twice with 0.5 mL of PBS, with 100 mM NH4Cl, and again with 0.",
    "5 mL of PBS.Immunofluorescence labelingDilute primary antibodies in the antibody dilution buffer according to their recommended dilution factors. Prepare two types of primary antibody mixtures. Mixture #1 contains giantin and GM130 primary antibodies, while mixture #2 has giantin primary antibody only.Invert the lid of the 24-well plate. Add 10 µL of mixture #1 and #2 onto the inverse side of the lid, corresponding to wells #1 and #2, respectively. Using a pair of sharp forceps, lift the coverslips #1 and #2, cell-side down, and place them onto the corresponding drops of mixture #1 and #2 on the lid. Put the lid into a Ziplock bag with a piece of wet Kimwipe® tissue inside. Seal the Ziplock bag and allow the cells to incubate with the primary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. Transfer the two pieces of glass coverslip, cell-side up, and place them onto the corresponding wells. Wash the glass coverslip with 0.5 mL of PBS three times.Wash the inverse side of the 24-well plate lid extensively with water. Next, wipe dry the inverse side of the lid with Kimwipe® tissue. Re-use the inverse side of the lid for secondary antibody incubation.Repeat the above steps described in step E2b) for the fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies. Use goat anti-rabbit AF488 and goat anti-mouse AF647 for coverslip #1 and goat anti-rabbit AF647 for coverslip #2.MountingAdd two drops of Mowiol mounting medium, 10 µL each, onto a piece of glass slide. Transfer coverslip #1 and #2 from the 24-well plate onto the two drops of Mowiol mounting medium, cell-side down. Dry glass coverslip at room temperature for 1 h. Seal the edge of the glass coverslip with colorless nail polish. The glass slide is then sealed in a Ziplock bag and stored at -20 °C until imaging.",
    "Note: Other mounting media should work too. However, we prefer Mowiol mounting medium as it solidifies, which makes it easier to handle the coverslips. ImagingAcquire cell images (16-bit) under the 63× objective using the SR mode in the Zeiss Airyscan microscope. Select cells with good signals and well-spread morphologies. Collect multiple three-channel image stacks with a z-step of 170 nm and pixel size of 45 nm. Image seven cells with one cell per image. Process raw Airyscan images using Zeiss Zen software."
