    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells\nTiming: 1.5 h\nFigure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] “Mononuclear cell isolation and staining for ALDH activity and lineage restricted cell surface markers” provides a schematic through which this experiment is summarized.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/442-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Mononuclear cell isolation and staining for ALDH activity and lineage restricted cell surface markers\nPlace up to 25 mL of collected whole blood in a 50 mL Falcon tube.\nDilute blood sample 1:1 with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and mix thoroughly.\nWe recommend using a pipetting controller on a slow setting with 10 mL serological pipettes.\n15 mL collection tubes\nFill 15 mL SepMate (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC) tube with 4 mL of room temperature (20°C) Ficoll Paque. Place serological pipette tip in the SepMate insert groove to guide the Ficoll (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A. Visual Representation of Sample Preparation),\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/442-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Visual representation of sample preparation\nNote that this can be done prior to beginning the experiment. You may find it preferable to prepare SepMate tubes in advance and place them in the fridge. This will reduce time needed for the Ficoll to reach room temperature (20°C).\nLayer up to 10 mL of whole blood + PBS solution into the SepMate collection tubes (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) for density centrifugation.\nWe recommend the slowest setting on the pipette controller to gently layer the whole blood + PBS mixture onto the Ficoll.\nLayer the blood while the SepMate tube is at a slight angle. This will limit blood and Ficoll mixing and will improve separation.\nCentrifuge the sample at 1,500 rpm (approximately 425 × g) for 10 min at room temperature (20°C) with the break ON.",
    "If unable to use SepMate system, follow the same procedure, but the sample will need to be centrifuged for 20 min with the break OFF. This will add significant time to cell processing.\nEnsure that the centrifuge is balanced properly to eliminate damage to the cells or centrifuge.\nRemove sample from centrifuge and collect the fluid above the SepMate insert (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) and place into a sterile 50 mL Falcon tube.\nSepMate allows for direct pour-over of contents, the SepMate insert will keep pelleted debris and red blood cells from contaminating the mononuclear cell layer.\nIf not using SepMate, removal of buffy coat should be done using a transfer pipette, with slow manual swirling. User should be very careful to not disturb the red blood cell pellet (See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).\nDiscard used SepMate tubes to maintain a clean workspace. (see Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])\nDilute the mononuclear cell sample 1:1 with PBS + 5% FBS (fetal bovine serum).\nThe growth factors found in FBS maintain cell homeostasis and limit cellular damage due to changes in solution tonicity.\nWe recommend preparing this solution using a full bottle (500 mL) of sterile PBS and then adding 5% (25 mL) of filtered FBS solution. This solution should be properly labeled and placed in a 2°C–8°C fridge for future use.\nCentrifuge the sample at 1,500 rpm (approximately 425 × g) for 7 min with the break ON\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 1 mL PBS + 5% FBS followed by addition 9 mL of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) red cell lysis buffer. (see Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])\nLet the sample rest at room temperature (20°C) for 8 min to ensure red cell lysis.\nCentrifuge the sample at 1,500 rpm (approximately 425 × g) for 7 min with the break ON.",
    "If any pink or red coloring remains in the pellet following centrifugation (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D) of the sample, repeat steps 8–10 to maximize erythrocyte depletion (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E). This repeat can be done up to 2 times, for a total of 3 rounds of red blood cell lysis.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet by washing with 3 mL of Aldefluor buffer assay solution (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC)\nSingle cell suspension should appear cloudy with disruption of the pellet.\nIf the pellet does not dissolve completely and appears as a suspension, you may choose to add more Aldefluor Assay Buffer to ensure proper emulsion. If proper emulsion does not occur, samples may become clogged in the flow cytometer or the cell sorter which may result in loss of sample or other technical difficulties.\nPipette approximately 20 μL of mixed sample into a 0.5 mL Eppendorf tube.\nInto the same Eppendorf, add 20 μL of Trypan blue and mix thoroughly to assess cell numbers and viability.\nAdd 10 μL of the cell solution +Trypan mixture to each hemocytometer chamber and count the viable (clear) and non-viable cells. Cell viability should be >90%. The usual PBMC yield is approximately 1 × 106 cells per mL of peripheral blood drawn. If the cell viability is <90% ensure proper mixture of the cell solution prior to addition of trypan blue. If this does not rectify the cell count, it is possible that that sample is no longer viable and phenotypic analyses may not be accurate.\nThe use of automated cell counting methods are also applicable.\nAdjust the sample to a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/mL with Aldefluor Assay Buffer.",
    "Note: Use of Aldefluor buffer is essential for subsequent steps as it contains a proprietary inhibitor of ATP-binding cassette pumps allowing for accumulation of Aldefluor substrate within viable cells.\nPurification of pro-vascular progenitor cells by ALDH activity\nTiming: approx. 1.5 h\nLabel 5 mL polystyrene Falcon tubes according to various surface markers and controls you will be examining.\nLabel one tube “no-ALDH,” this will be divided into tubes allocated for the unstained control and each fluorescence isotype.\nLabel one tube “ALDH-inhibited,” this will be used to evaluate ALDH-inhibited controls using DEAB.\nLabel one tube “ALDH-stained,” this will contain cells with activated aldehyde dehydrogenase and will be later divided into tubes for examining FMOs and antibody-stained aliquots.\nAllow the Aldefluor reagent and kit components (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, BC) to come to room temperature (20°C)\nRemove an aliquot (we suggest 20 μL of previously activated Aldefluor substrate for each aliquot) from the freezer (−20°C) and allow to come to room temperature (20°C).\nNote: to view activation of Aldefluor protocol and more details regarding product use, visit https://cdn.stemcell.com/media/files/pis/29888-PIS_1_1_2.pdf[href=https://cdn.stemcell.com/media/files/pis/29888-PIS_1_1_2.pdf]\nWe recommend separating the cell solution into several 5 mL polystyrene tubes to reduce formation of sample clogs, however, the use of 5 mL polypropylene tubes are acceptable.\nPlace 1 mL of the cell solution, which equates to approximately 1 × 106 cells/mL into a tube labeled “no-ALDH.” Cap the tube and set it aside.\nPlace 2 mL of the cell solution into an additional tube labeled “ALDH-stained” tube. This sample will act as the Aldefluor-stained positive control.\nAdd 5 μL of Aldefluor DEAB Reagent to the “ALDH-inhibited” (DEAB) tube.\nCritical: Recap DEAB vial immediately. If not, the DEAB will begin to evaporate and reduce inhibition potency.\nDEAB is a reversible pharmacological inhibitor of cytosolic ALDH activity. (see Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])",
    "Add 5 μL of the activated Aldefluor Reagent per mL of sample to the “ALDH-stained” tube.\nMix and immediately transfer 500 μL of the cell mixture to the “ALDH-inhibited” (DEAB) tube.\nMix gently with P1000 pipette.\nPlace “ALDH-inhibited” and “ALDH-stained” samples into a 37°C with 5% CO2 incubator for 30–60 min.\nPlace “no-ALDH” tube at 2°C–8°C until the “ALDH-stained” and “ALDH-inhibited” samples are removed from the incubator.\nStaining of pro-vascular progenitor cells\nTiming: approx. 1 h\nLabel a 5 mL polystyrene Falcon tubes according to single fluorochromes you will be examining.\nFrom your “no-ALDH” unstained control, add an equal sample volume into each fluorochrome labeled tube. For example, you will have one PE labeled tube, one PE-Cy7 labeled tube etc.\nIf following the exact methodology using 6 fluorochromes, you will have 7 tubes in total (including the “no-ALDH” unstained control). This will equal approximately 125 μL into each tube.\nNote: There is no limitation to the number of cells needed to run flow cytometry, less sample, however, may result in fewer events of the desired cell population. We suggest a maximum of 6 fluorochromes to ensure ample cellular events.\nKeep any remaining sample in the “no-ALDH” unstained control.\nLabel a 5 mL polystyrene Falcon tubes for each fluorescence minus one (FMOs) control you will be examining.\nFor example, if you are using 6 fluorophores, you will have 6 FMO tubes.\nLabel a 5 mL polystyrene Falcon tube for each fully stained panel you will be examining.\nFor example, if you have 4 full panels, you will require 4 tubes.\nWe suggest labeling each tube with the cell of interest. For example, “FULL-hematopoietic,” “FULL-monocyte,” “FULL-endothelial” etc.",
    "After 30–60 min in the incubator, remove the “ALDH-inhibited” and “ALDH-stained” tubes from the incubator and mix the contents of each tube with a P1000 pipette (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F).\nFrom the “ALDH-stained” sample tube, allot an equal sample volume into each FMO and full stain tube.\nIf following our exact methodology of 6 fluorochromes, you will have 10 tubes in total, including the “ALDH-stained” control (1 ALDH-stained control, 5 FMO, 4 full stained tubes). This will equal approximately 180 μL into each tube.\nFollowing aliquot, keep any remaining sample in the “ALDH-stained” control.\nCentrifuge all the FMO tubes, full panel tubes, “ALDH-inhibited” and “ALDH-stained” control tubes at 1,500 rpm (approximately 425 × g) for 5 min with the break ON.\nThe unstained “non-ALDH” tube and fluorochrome isotype tubes do not have to be centrifuged at this point.\nFollowing the centrifugation, remove the supernatant of each tube described in step 26, and resuspend the pellet in approx. 200 μL of Aldefluor Assay Buffer per sample tube using P200 pipette.\nAdd 4 μL each antibody to your test tube based on your specified panels (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) using a P10 or P20 micropipette.\nNote: do not dilute the antibodies.\nFollowing addition of all antibodies, mix gently with a P200 pipette to ensure proper mixture of the sample.\nCritical: change pipette tips when introducing each unique antibody to avoid contamination of your sample and antibody storage.\nFor each fluorochrome isotype, place only the fluorochrome of interest. For example, only the PE-conjugated antibody in the PE isotype tube.\nFor each FMO, place every fluorochrome except the one of interest. For example, everything but PE in the FMO-PE tube.\nFor each full panel tube, place all antibodies specific to each cell panel.",
    "Place all samples in the fridge (2°–8°C) for at least 30 min. This will allow for appropriate antibody binding onto MNCs.\nNote: Antibodies can remain in the fridge for longer than 30 min, but we recommend a maximum of 2 h to ensure the analyses of fresh samples.\nFollowing incubation, place all samples including “non-ALDH” unstained control in the centrifuge at 1,500 rpm (approximately 425 × g) for 5 min with the break ON.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend cells in approximately 300 μL of Aldefluor Assay Buffer using a P1000 pipette.\nCritical: Ensure that the pellet is properly dissolved in the solution. If the solution is too concentrated, it will appear cloudy. To remedy this, add more Aldefluor Assay Buffer until the sample is clear. If the sample is not properly diluted, clogging of the flow cytometer or cell sorter may occur, reducing the number of accurately processed events.\nCap the 5 mL polystyrene Falcon tubes and place in the fridge (2°C–8°C) until ready to be analyzed on the flow cytometer.\nNote: If unable to analyze on the cytometer or cell sorter immediately, we suggest leaving the prepared cells in the fridge for a maximum of 3 h. Also note that cells must be analyzed within 24 h of peripheral blood collection to ensure appropriate viability and expression of surface markers. (See Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])\nPreparing for flow cytometry\nA typical flow cytometry panel of this nature contains (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_442_1.csv\nan unstained control to optimize the laser voltages for the cell population of interest;\nan isotype control for each fluorescence-labeled anti-human antibody (which will account for non-specific binding);\na single-stained compensation control tube for each fluorescence-labeled anti-human antibody employed;\ntubes containing fluorescent anti-human antibodies that are used for final analyses.",
    "We divide our antibody panels using cell surface markers expressed on 4 specific cell types including primitive progenitor, endothelial, monocyte precursors, and granulocytes. Each antibody is selected based on published literature and our lab’s experience with these surface markers. Furthermore, our panels typically consist of six different fluorochromes including FITC, PE, PerCP-Cy5.5, PE-Cy7, APC, and BV421.\nRunning flow cytometry\nTiming: approx. 1.5 h\nNote: We typically do not filter our cells prior to flow cytometry as the addition of excess Aldefluor buffer is sufficient to remove clumps of cells that did not properly dissolve. If this technique does not remedy the formation of clumps, we suggest using a 35 μm mesh cap to filter the cells (Falcon 352235).\nBelow is the typical order through which our tubes are assessed. Please refer to Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] “Sample Workflow of Precursor Cell Analyses by Flow Cytometry” for a schematic outlining a sample flow cytometry analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/442-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Sample workflow of precursor cell analyses by flow cytometry\nUnstained control – will be used to establish forward and side scatter which examine cell size and granularity respectively. This allows for the effective characterization of cell morphology during analysis. Furthermore, from this panel we will gate on only cellular events, removing any excess debris or red blood cell contamination (these events have very low forward and side scatter values). We suggest recording 50,000 events to allow for precise gating of cellular events.\nCompensation tubes – each tube will be specific for the fluorochromes that will be utilized. These tubes are used to optimize the compensation and to correct for any spectral overlap between fluorophores. We suggest recording 20,000 events per compensation tube to allow for accurate compensation.",
    "DEAB control – will be used to create a positive and negative region for ALDH activity. This is especially important as we can confirm the immature phenotype of primitive progenitor cells. The gate should be set at < 0.5% and we suggest recording 50,000 events to allow for precise gating of DEAB inhibition.\nALDH activity – will be used to assess ALDH activity in PBMNCs. There should be clear separation of granulocyte precursor and mature cells as depicted in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. Furthermore, what we term ALDHhiSSClow cells should have the greatest ALDH activity as they are the most primitive cell type, as such, they will have a greater forward scatter value than all other cell types. We suggest recording 50,000 events to allow for precise gating of ALDH activity and subsequent cell populations. (see Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting])\nFluorescence minus one (FMO) tubes – will be used to establish gates for each fluorochrome in your panel. Each tube will contain all fluorochromes of interest but one. For example, the FMO for PE in our panel would contain FITC, PerCP-Cy5.5, PE-Cy7, APC, and BV421. We suggest recording 50,000 events for each FMO tube to allow for precise gating of each fluorophore.\nFull panel analyses – is comprised of all surface marker antibodies in the specific panel you are testing. Since most analyses will come from these tubes, we suggest recording upwards of 1 million events to allow for appropriate examination of rare cellular events."
