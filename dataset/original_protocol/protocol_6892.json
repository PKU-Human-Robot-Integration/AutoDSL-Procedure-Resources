    "Construction of expression vectors for BiFC based on Venus. This procedure is based on our published work with BiFC vectors for lentiviral Nef alleles and the Tec family kinases Btk and Itk (Tarafdar et al., 2014; Li et al., 2020) but can be easily adapted to virtually any combination of interacting protein partners. While our approach uses pcDNA3-based expression vectors that drive strong protein expression in 293T cells, other vectors can be substituted depending on the target cell type and application. Additional details related to primer design, subcloning strategy, and sequences of the final fusion constructs are provided in the Appendix[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20210621/4068%20Supplementary%20file%20s1.docx].PCR-amplify the coding sequence for the Venus N-terminal (VN: residues Val2 to Asp173) and C-terminal (VC: residues Ala154 to Lys238) fragments containing the appropriate restriction sites and a stop codon, and subclone the PCR product into the mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3.1(–).PCR-amplify the coding sequence for HIV-1 Nef (SF2) and SIV Nef (mac239) in the same manner and subclone the product into the pcDNA3.1(–)/VN construct.PCR-amplify the full-length human Tec family kinase cDNA clones containing the appropriate restriction sites and a C-terminal V5 epitope tag for ligation in-frame into the pcDNA3.1(–)/VC construct.293T cell culture and transfectionCulture 293T cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 37°C humidified incubator with a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Use 10 ml DMEM per 10-cm culture dish and maintain cells at a density of 2-5 × 104 cells/cm2. When cultures reach 80% confluence, remove the spent medium and split 1:10 by incubating with 1.0 ml 0.05% trypsin-EDTA solution for 1 min at 37°C to generate a single cell suspension. Add 10 ml fresh medium and spin at 500 × g for 5 min. Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml fresh medium and transfer 1.",
    "0 ml cell suspension to new 10-cm dishes with an additional 10 ml fresh medium. For transfection, seed 2.5 × 105 cells per MatTek plate and culture overnight.Transfect cells with BiFC expression vectors using X-tremeGene 9 DNA transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, mix 3 µl X-tremeGene 9 with 97 µl DMEM, add each BiFC expression plasmid (0.5 µg each VN and VC construct), and incubate the mixture at room temperature for 15 min. After incubation, add the transfection complex dropwise to the MatTek culture plate. Treat the cells with inhibitors or the DMSO carrier solvent (0.1% final concentration) 4 h after transfection as needed.Immunofluorescence stainingForty hours post-transfection, fix the cells by replacing the medium with 2 ml 4% paraformaldehyde and incubate for 10 min at room temperature. Wash cells with 2 ml PBS (pH 7.4) for 5 min with occasional gentle shaking by hand.Permeabilize the cells with 2 ml 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Wash cells twice with 2.0 ml PBS for 5 min each.Block the cells with 2 ml 2% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.Incubate the cells with anti-V5 (kinase tag) and anti-Nef or anti-pTyr (or anti-Btk pY551/anti-Itk pY511) antibodies diluted 1:1,000 in 250 µl PBS with 2% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Wash cells three times with 2 ml PBS for 5 min each.Incubate the cells with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to Texas Red or Pacific Blue at a dilution of 1:500 or 1:1,000, respectively. Wash the cells three times with 2 ml PBS for 5 min each. Keep cells in 2 ml PBS for imaging.",
    "Note: This protocol was developed for 3-color imaging to allow simultaneous detection of interaction (Venus complementation) and protein expression of each interacting partner (kinase and Nef), or interaction, kinase expression, and kinase activity (overall cellular phosphotyrosine content or activation loop autophosphorylation). Fluorescence imaging and analysisAcquire images using multi-color confocal microscopy with a 60× objective using x-y scan mode. On the Olympus FluoView1000, we used the violet laser to detect Pacific Blue (405 nm), the green laser to detect fluorescence complementation (Venus; 543 nm), and the red laser to detect Texas Red (633 nm).Perform single-cell image analysis using the Java-based image processing program, ImageJ, as described under Data analysis."
