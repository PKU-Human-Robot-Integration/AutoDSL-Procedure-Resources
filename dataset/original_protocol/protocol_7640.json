    "Pre-activation and storage of SLO aliquots Carefully open the bottle containing the lyophilized SLO.Add 500 μL of PBS + 10 mM DTT to the bottle.Resuspend the SLO by inverting the bottle multiple times and briefly vortexing.Pre-activate the SLO by placing the bottle within a 37 °C incubator for 2 h.Measure the protein concentration of the reconstituted SLO using the protein assay dye reagent.Snap-freeze 10 μL aliquots of pre-activated SLO in liquid nitrogen.Store at -80 °C until use in Procedure C.Note: Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles of the pre-activated SLO aliquots. Isolation of cytosol from cultured HCT116 WT cells Culture 20 mm × 150 mm plates of HCT116 WT cells to 95% confluence in 30 mL of cell culture growth medium at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (DMEM, GlutaMAXTM + 10% FBS).Place the cells on ice and aspirate the conditioned medium.Wash the cells with 10 mL of cold PBS per 150 mm plate.Aspirate the PBS wash buffer.Harvest the cells in cold PBS (containing protease inhibitors) using a cell scraper (1 mL of PBS per 150 mm plate) and transfer to a pre-chilled 50 mL conical tube.Note: This is done five plates at a time. Add 5 mL of cold PBS to one 150 mm plate, harvest the cells, and use this buffer to collect the cells with the next four plates. Centrifuge the cells at 200× g for 5 min at 4 °C to sediment the cells. Discard the supernatant.Resuspend the cell pellet in 3 mL of cold hypotonic lysis buffer and incubate on ice for 15 min.Transfer the cell suspension to a pre-chilled 7 mL dounce homogenizer.Homogenize the cells using approximately 80 strokes with a tight-fitting dounce.",
    "Centrifuge at 1,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C in a SorvallTM ST16R centrifuge using a TX-200 swinging bucket rotor with a 15 mL conical tube adapter to sediment unruptured cells.Collect the supernatant conservatively and transfer to a 5 mL ultra-clear tube.Note: The volume of the post-nuclear supernatant should be ~3–4 mL. Be careful not to disturb the pellet when collecting the supernatant. Centrifuge at ~128,000× g (32,500 rpm) for 30 min at 4 °C in an Optima XE-90 ultracentrifuge using a SW 55 Ti rotor to sediment cellular membranes.Collect the supernatant (cytosol fraction) conservatively and transfer to a 4 mL Amicon 3k concentrator.Centrifuge at 4,000× g for 6 × 10 min at 4 °C in a SorvallTM ST16R centrifuge using a TX-200 swinging bucket rotor with a 15 mL conical tube adapter to concentrate the cytosol.Note: Resuspend the cytosol after each 10-min centrifugation step to prevent protein precipitation. Monitor the retentate and flowthrough using the protein assay dye reagent to ensure minimal protein loss. Collect the cytosol and measure the protein concentration using the Bio-Rad protein assay dye reagent.Note: The cytosol concentration should be ~40 mg/mL. This may vary depending on the cell line utilized. Snap-freeze aliquots of cytosol in liquid nitrogen.Store at -80 °C until use in Procedure D.Note: Avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles of the concentrated cytosol aliquots. Preparation of SLO-permeabilized HCT116 CD63-Nluc cells Culture HCT116 CD63-Nluc cells to ~80% confluence in the desired number of wells within a 24-well PDL-coated plate. We typically utilize three technical replicates per experimental condition.Note: Do not allow cells to become overconfluent. We have observed variability in SLO permeabilization in overconfluent cultures. Place the cells on ice and aspirate the conditioned medium.Wash each well with 500 μL of cold PBS containing 1 mM EGTA.",
    "Aspirate the PBS wash buffer and replace with 200 μL of SLO binding buffer.Gently shake at 4 °C for 15 min on a lateral shaker to allow SLO to bind to the surface of the cells.Aspirate the SLO binding buffer and wash with 500 μL of cold transport buffer to remove excess unbound SLO.Aspirate the wash buffer and add 500 μL of pre-warmed permeabilization buffer.Incubate the 24-well plate at 37 °C for 10 min to initiate cell permeabilization.Assess cell permeabilization (%) using the 10× objective of a phase contrast microscope.Note: The nucleoli of SLO-permeabilized cells should appear very distinct. Approximately 95%–100% of cells should be permeabilized at this stage (Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20231110/20231110001942_4127.jpgFigure 1. Morphology of unpermeabilized and Streptolysin O (SLO)-permeabilized cells. HCT116 CD63-Nluc cells were processed as detailed in steps C1–C9 without (left) or with (right) SLO addition. Scale bars: 100 μm.Return the 24-well plate to ice.Aspirate the permeabilization buffer, replace with 500 μL of cold transport buffer, and gently shake the 24-well plate at 4 °C for 10 min on a lateral shaker.Note: Start to assemble the reaction mixes for the reconstitution reactions at this time (protocol detailed in step C1 and Table 1). Table 1. Sample calculation for biochemical exosome secretion reconstitution reactions. Each column represents a single condition for the reconstitution reaction. The total volume for each reaction mix is 250 μL for one reaction replicate and pipetting error. Each row represents the component to be added to each reaction, and the volumes indicated are in microliter. Each reaction mix can be scaled for the desired number of reaction replicates.table:",

    "Aspirate the transport buffer, replace with 500 μL of cold high-salt transport buffer, and gently shake the plate at 4 °C for 10 min on a lateral shaker.Aspirate the high-salt transport buffer, replace with 500 μL of cold transport buffer, and gently shake the plate at 4 °C for 10 min on a lateral shaker.Proceed immediately to Procedure D.Biochemical reconstitution of Ca2+-dependent exosome secretion In low retention tubes, sequentially assemble the reconstitution reaction mixes by adding the reaction components (from top to bottom). A complete 200 μL reaction contains an ATP regeneration system (1 mM ATP, 40 mM creatine phosphate, 0.2 mg/mL creatine phosphokinase), 0.15 mM GTP, 4 mg/mL cytosol, and 2 mM CaCl2.Aspirate the wash buffer from step C13 and replace with 200 μL of the reaction mix for each condition.Incubate the 24-well plate on ice for 5 min.Place the entire 24-well plate in a 30 °C water bath for 2 min to stimulate exosome secretion.Place the 24-well plate back on ice and immediately load 100 μL of each reaction supernatant into an AcroPrep 96-well 0.4 μm filter plate placed on top of a 96-well collection plate.Centrifuge the AcroPrep 96-well 0.4 μm filter plate at 1,500× g for 1 min at 4 °C in an Eppendorf 5810 R centrifuge using a A-4-62 swinging bucket rotor with a plate adaptor.While waiting on the centrifuge run, add 100 μL of cold transport buffer + 2% TX-100 (containing protease inhibitors) to each well of cells within the 24-well plate (for a final TX-100 concentration of 1%) to lyse the cells.The filtrate collected from step D6 is used to measure exosome secretion, and the lysate from step D7 is used to normalize exosome secretion between sample conditions.",
    "Luminescence measurements For the luminescence measures to quantify exosome secretion:Add 50 μL of the filtrate from step D6 to a microcentrifuge tube.Add 100 μL of Nluc substrate/inhibitor master mix to the filtrate.Vortex the sample briefly (~1 s) and measure luminescence in a Promega Glowmax 20/20 luminometer.Note: This luminescence reading (Measurement A) represents CD63-Nluc luminescence obtained from intact exosomes. Remove the sample tube from the luminometer and add 1.5 μL of 10% TX-100 (for a final TX-100 concentration of 0.1%) to solubilize membranes.Note: This allows the membrane-impermeable Nluc inhibitor to quench any luminescence derived from membrane-protected compartments. Vortex the sample briefly (~1 s) and measure luminescence in a Promega Glowmax 20/20 luminometer.Note: This luminescence reading (Measurement B) represents background Nluc luminescence for each sample. For the luminescence measurements to normalize between samples:Add 50 μL of the lysate from step D7 to a microcentrifuge tube.Add 50 μL of Nluc lytic master mix to the lysate.Vortex the sample briefly (~1 s) and measure luminescence in a Promega Glowmax 20/20 luminometer.Note: This luminescence reading (Measurement C) represents total CD63-Nluc luminescence from cells and is used to normalize exosome secretion between samples."
