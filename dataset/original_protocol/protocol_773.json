    "**Preparation of magnetic nano-ferrite** &#x25CF; TIMING 4 h\n1. Weigh 13.9 g of Iron\\(II) sulfate heptahydrate and place it in 100 ml glass beaker containing a magnetic stirring bar.\n  2. Add 400 ml of distilled water to the beaker.\n  3. Stir the reaction mixture using magnetic stirrer for 10 minutes, at room temperature.\n  4. Weigh 20 g of Iron\\(III) sulfate pentahydrate and add it to the above reaction mixture\\(Step 3) under stirring.\n  5. Add 100 ml of distilled water and stir the reaction mixture for another 20 minutes.\n  6. Measure 50 ml of ammonium hydroxide \\(25%) aqueous solution in dropping funnel.\n  \\! CAUTION Toxic if inhaled and causes burns by all exposure\n7. Add ammonium hydroxide drop-wise to adjust the pH of the solution to 10. \n  &#x25B2;CRITICAL STEP Reaction mixture starts becoming black, indicating the formation of nanoparticles; keep adding ammonium hydroxide slowly to reach the pH ~ 10.\n8. Continually stir the reaction mixture for 1 h at 50 &#xB0;C. \n  9. Separate the nanoparticles from aqueous reaction mixture using external magnet or decantation.\n  10. Wash the nanoparticles with water several times until the pH reaches 7.\n  11. Wash the nanoparticles with acetone two times.\n  12. Dry the nanoparticles under a vacuum at 60 &#xB0;C for 2 h, to yield magnetic nano-ferrite.\n   &#x25A0; PAUSE POINT After drying, the material can be stored in sealed vessel at room temperature.\n**Functionalization of magnetic nano-ferrite** &#x25CF; TIMING 5 h\n13. Weigh 2 g of magnetic nano-ferrite yielded from Step 12.\n  14. Place it in 50 ml round bottom flask.\n  15. Add 20 ml of water and 5 ml of ethanol.\n  16. Disperse the nanoparticles by sonication for 10 min at room temperature.\n  17. Weigh 2 g of dopamine hydrochloride and dissolve it in 5 ml of water.",
    "18. Add this aqueous dopamine solution to the round bottom flask containing dispersed \\(Step 16) nanomaterials.\n  19. Sonicate the reaction mixture for 2 hr at room temperature.\n  20.

Wash the nanoparticles \\(obtained in Step 21) with 2 ml \\(3X) of water.\n   &#x25B2;CRITICAL STEP Nanoparticles obtained in Step 21 need to be washed to remove unreacted dopamine salt, however, use of water in excess amount may solubilize functionalized nanomaterial; materials should not be washed with more than 2 ml of water each time.\n23. Wash the nanoparticles with 5 ml of acetone \\(2X).\n  24. Dry it under vacuum at 50 &#xB0;C for 2 h, to yield amine-functionalized nanomaterial.\n   &#x25A0; PAUSE POINT After drying, the material can be stored in a sealed vessel at room temperature.\n               \n**Preparation of ruthenium hydroxide supported on magnetic nanoparticle \\(nano-ferrite-Ru\\(OH)x) catalyst** &#x25CF; TIMING 40 h\n25. Weigh 2 g of amine-functionalized nano-ferrite obtained in Step 24.\n  26. Place it in 100 ml round bottom flask.\n  27. Add 20 ml of water.\n  28. Disperse the nanoparticles by sonication for 10 min at room temperature.\n  29. Prepare 8.3 x 10<sup>-3</sup> M solution of ruthenium\\(III) chloride in water.\n  30. Add 60 ml of the above solution \\(prepared in Step 29) to dispersed nanoparticles \\(of Step 28).\n  31. Sonicate the reaction mixture for another 10 min.\n  32. Place magnetic bar in the round bottom flask.\n  33. Stir the solution for 20 min at room temperature.\n  34. Prepare 1 M solution of sodium hydroxide in water.\n  35.

    "37. Isolate the nanomaterial by using external magnet or by centrifugation.\n  38. Wash the nanoparticles with 5 mL water \\(2X) and then with 10 mL acetone \\(2X).\n  39. Dry it under a vacuum at 50 &#xB0;C for 2 h, to yield ruthenium hydroxide supported on magnetic nanoparticle catalyst.\n   &#x25A0; PAUSE POINT After drying, the material can be stored in a sealed vessel at room temperature.\n**Hydration of nitriles using nano-ferrite-Ru\\(OH)x catalyst**    &#x25CF; TIMING 1 h \n40.
