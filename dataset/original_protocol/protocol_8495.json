    "1. Culturing and Maintenance of Hana3A Cells\nMaintain cells in 10 mL of minimum essential medium (MEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 µg/mL penicillin-streptomycin, and 1.25 µg/mL amphotericin B in a 100-mm cell culture dish in a 37 °C cell culture incubator with 5% CO2. With every other passage, add 1 µg/mL puromycin to maintain stable transfection of plasmids (See Introduction).\n\tNOTE: Perform all steps involving cell culture in a class II biological safety cabinet to ensure sterile environment.\nSubculture at a ratio of 10-20% in 100-mm dishes every 2-3 days.\n2. Plating Cells for Transfection\nObserve the Hana3A cells under a phase-contrast microscope to ensure cell viability and to estimate confluence.\nAspirate all medium from the cell culture dish.\nWash cells by adding 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) onto the plate, swirling the dish, and aspirating the PBS.\nAdd 3 mL of 0.05% trypsin-ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) onto the plate. Mix for 1 min or until all cells are afloat.\n\tNOTE: Observe the progress of cells detaching from the bottom of the plate under the microscope as necessary.\nInactivate trypsin by adding 5 mL of MEM with 10% FBS and pipette up and down to break up chunks of cell mass.\n\tNOTE: For plating prior to transfection, the medium used should not contain antibiotics. Addition of antibiotics may decrease transfection efficiency.",
    "Transfer an appropriate amount of cells to a 15-mLl tube depending on the number of plates to be transfected. For each 96-well plate, plate 2 x 106 cells, or approximately 1/5 of a 100% confluent 100 mm dish, giving a cell count of 2 x 104 cells per well or a density of approximately 15-30% confluence per well. Centrifuge tubes at 200 x g for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\n\tNOTE: Calculate the correct amount of cells to be plated onto 96-well plates to avoid overgrowing or undergrowing cells prior to stimulation.\nAdd an appropriate amount of MEM with 10% FBS into the 15-mL tube and pipette up and down to break up chunks of the cell mass. For each 96-well plate, resuspend the cells with 6 mL of MEM with 10% FBS.\n\tNOTE: Be careful not to generate air bubbles in the tube.\nAdd the suspended cells into a reservoir. Using a multichannel pipette, pipette 50 µL of cells onto each well of a 96-well plate. Incubate overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\n3. Transfection of Plasmids\nPrior to transfection, observe the plated cells to ensure a proper confluence of approximately 30-50% per well under a phase-contrast microscope and return to the incubator.\nPrepare in advance the Rho-tagged OR construct11,21,22,28, the accessory factor constructs (RTP1S22,36 and M3R23), and the biosensor variant construct29,30 by miniprep. Quantify the DNA concentration by a spectrophotometer and adjust plasmid DNA concentrations (e.g., to 100 ng/µL) with distilled water as necessary.\nPreparation of the Transfection Mixtures\nPrepare a plasmid transfection mixture in 500 µL of MEM for each 96-well plate according to Table 1.",
    "NOTE: When different ORs are tested on the same 96-well plate, the volume of the transfection mixture and the amount of plasmid DNA added must be adapted in function of the number of transfected wells with a given OR.\nPrepare a transfection mixture in a tube with 18 µL of lipid-mediated transfection reagent in 500 µL of MEM.\nMix the plasmid mixture with the transfection mixture by pipetting up and down. Incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nStop the reaction by adding 5 mL of MEM with 10% FBS.\nSpread out a thick layer of sterile paper towels in the cell culture hood. Take a 96-well plate with cells from the incubator. Gently and repeatedly tap the plate upside-down on the pile of paper towel so that the medium is completely absorbed by the paper towel.\n\tNOTE: Do not forcefully or abruptly tap the plate as one could lose cells.\nTransfer 50 µL of the combined transfection mixture to each well of the 96-well plate and incubate overnight for 18-24 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2.\n\tNOTE: A time-managed transfection and stimulation schedule should precede the measurement when more than one 96-well plate are tested in one experiment in order to have all plates measured after the same transfection time and stimulus exposure time.\n4. Stimulation and Measuring OR Activity Using the Real-Time cAMP Assay\nObserve the transfected cells under a phase-contrast microscope to ensure a proper confluence of 50-80% per well and return to the incubator.\nPrepare the stimulation medium by adding 10 mM hydroxyethyl piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) and 5 mM glucose to Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS).\nThaw the real-time cAMP assay substrate reagent aliquots on ice. Store substrate reagent at -80 °C at 55 µL per tube in PCR tubes. Use 1 tube per plate.",
    "Prepare 2% equilibration solution by mixing 55 µL of the substrate reagent and 2750 µL HBSS/HEPES/glucose solution.\nSpread out a thick layer of paper towels on the bench. Gently and repeatedly tap the plate upside-down on the paper towel so that the transfection medium is completely absorbed by the paper towel.\nWash the cells by pipetting 50 µL of HBSS/HEPES/glucose solution to each well.\nGently and repeatedly tap out the HBSS/HEPES/glucose solution from the 96-well plate.\nPipette 25 µL of 2% equilibration solution to each well and incubate at room temperature in dark for 2 h.\nPrepare in advance 1 M odorant stock solutions in DMSO and store at -20 °C until used.\nPrior to the end of the incubation time, dilute the odorant stock solutions to working concentrations in HBSS/HEPES/glucose stimulation medium.\n\tNOTE: The concentrations of the odorant dilutions prepared in this step should be doubled to yield the correct final concentrations in each well.\nUsing a chemiluminescence plate reader and before odorant addition, measure the basal luminescence level of the plate for 2 consecutive times at a rate of 1000 ms per well34.\nQuickly remove the plate from the plate reader and add 25 µL odorant dilutions to each well and immediately start continuous luminescence measurement of all wells for 20 cycles within 30 min.\n\tNOTE: Pipette carefully to avoid contaminating neighboring wells when using different odorants and/or different concentrations of the same odorants in the same plate.\n5. Data Analysis\nExport the data from the chemiluminescence plate reader software.\nCalculate normalized OR response for each time point using the formula\n\t(luminescenceN – luminescencebasal)/(luminescencehighest – luminescencebasal)",
    "where N = luminescence value of a certain well; basal = average luminescence value of the two basal luminescence values; highest = highest luminescence value of a plate or a set of plates.\n\tNOTE: Depending on the purpose of the experiment, alternative graphical representations can be adopted. For example, for screening assays (see Figure 1) and for generating concentration-response curves, the luminescence value of a certain well at a desired time point during the kinetic measurement, such as the maximum value or the final value, can be used.\nSubscription Required.
