    "1. Working concentration of the reaction components\nPrepare the working concentrations of buffers for CD and other reaction components freshly (see Table 1) and keep them at 4 °C before setting up the reactions.\n\tNOTE: For the CD reactions described in this paper, the working concentrations of components are as follows: Sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) 1 mM, ATP 2 mM, DNA 500 nM, Protein 1 µM, MgCl2 10 mM, EDTA 50 mM, ADAADiN 5 µM.\n2. ATPase activity\nBefore CD spectroscopy, establish the ATPase activity of the protein in the presence of the DNA molecules to ensure that the protein used in the CD spectroscopy is active and to identify the DNA molecules that are optimally effective in eliciting ATP hydrolysis.\nMeasure the ATPase activity of the protein in the presence of different DNA molecules by an NADH-coupled oxidation assay consisting of the following two reactions.\n\t\nMix 0.1 µM ADAAD, 2 mM ATP, 10 nM DNA, and 1x REG buffer in a 96-well plate to a final volume of 250 µL.\n\t\tNOTE: The pyruvate kinase enzyme uses the ADP and Pi to convert phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate, thus regenerating ATP. This ensures that ATP is always in a saturating concentration in the reaction. In the second reaction, the pyruvate formed by the action of pyruvate kinase is converted by lactate dehydrogenase to lactate. In this reaction, one NADH molecule is oxidized to NAD+. The consumption of NADH is measured by measuring the absorbance of the molecule at 340 nm.\nIncubate for 30 min at 37 °C in an incubator.\nMeasure the amount of NAD+ at 340 nm using a microplate reader.\nTo measure the amount of NAD+, use the software provided along with the microplate reader.\n\t\t\nClick on the NADH assay to measure the absorbance at 340 nm.",
    "Place the 96-well plate on the plate holder in the instrument. Click on the Read Plate button to record the absorbance.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The concentration of NAD+ is calculated using the molar extinction coefficient of NADH as 6.3 mM−1 by using eq (1).\nA = εcl (1)\n\t\t\tHere, A = Absorbance\nε = Molar extinction coefficient\n\t\t\tc = Molar concentration\n\t\t\tl = Optical path length in cm\n3. Choosing and preparation of CD cuvettes\nCollect CD spectra in high-transparency quartz cuvettes. Use rectangular or cylindrical cuvettes.\n\tNOTE: A CD quartz cuvette (nominal volume of 0.4 mL, path-length of 1 mm) was used for all the reactions described in this paper.\nUse a cuvette cleaning solution to clean the cuvette. Add 1% cuvette cleaning solution in water to make 400 µL of the solution, pour it in the cuvette, and incubate it at 37 °C for 1 h.\nWash the cuvette with water several times to clean the cuvette. Take a scan of the water or buffer in the cuvette to check whether it is clean.\n\tNOTE: The water or buffer must give a reading in the 0 to 1 mdeg range.\n4. Preparation of proteins and DNA oligonucleotide\nKeep the volume of the protein below 50 µL in the reaction to minimize the amounts of the buffer components that sometimes cause the formation of ambiguous peaks. Keep the protein on the ice throughout the experiment to avoid any degradation.\nUse PAGE-purified DNA oligonucleotides in the reactions.\n\tNOTE: In the reactions described here, DNA was used both in native as well as heat-cooled forms (fast-cooled (FC) and slow-cooled (SC)). Fast cooling promotes intramolecular bonding in the DNA, yielding more secondary structures. In contrast, slow cooling promotes intermolecular bonding in the DNA, resulting in fewer secondary structures.",
    "For fast-cooling, heat DNA at 94 °C for 3 min on the heating block and immediately cool it on ice. For slow-cooling, heat DNA at 94 °C for 3 min and allow it to cool to room temperature at a rate of 1 °C per minute.\n5. Setting up control experiments to record the baseline spectra\nKeep the reaction volume at 300 µL in all the reactions. Set up a total of 5 baseline reactions in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes, one by one, as follows: i) Buffer + Water; ii) Buffer + MgCl2 + ATP + Water; iii) Buffer + MgCl2 + ATP + Protein + Water; iv) iii + EDTA or ADAADiN; v) Buffer + Protein +Water.\n6. Setting up the experiments to record CD spectra\nSet up a total of 5 reactions, one by one, in 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes as follows: i) Buffer + DNA + Water; ii) Buffer + DNA + MgCl2 + ATP + Water; iii) Buffer + DNA + MgCl2 + ATP + Protein + Water; iv) iii + EDTA or ADAADiN; v) Buffer + DNA + Protein +Water.\n7. Recording scan\nTurn on the gas and switch on the CD spectrometer.\nSwitch on the lamp after 10-15 min. Switch on the water bath and set the holder temperature at 37 °C.\nOpen the CD spectrum software.\n\t\nSet the temperature to 37 °C.\nSet the wavelength range at 180 - 300 nm.\nSet the time per point to 0.5 s.\nSet the scan number to 5.\nClick on Pro-Data Viewer, make a new file, and rename it with details about the experiment and date.",
    "Keep all the reaction components on ice to avoid any degradation. Make the baselines and reactions, one by one, in centrifuge tubes and mix them by pipetting. Transfer the reaction mix to the cuvette carefully, ensuring that there are no air bubbles.\nIf performing a time-course experiment, incubate the reactions at 37 °C for the required time and take the scan. Add EDTA to the buffer containing the DNA, ATP, Mg+2, and protein to stop ATP hydrolysis.\nIncrease the concentration of EDTA and its incubation time to inhibit ATPase activity completely.\nSubtract the baselines from the corresponding reactions in the software (e.g., subtract reaction 1 from baseline 1). Smoothen the data either in the CD spectrum software or in the data plotting software. Plot the data in the data plotting software.\n\tNOTE: Subtracting the baselines from the corresponding reactions will give the net CD spectra of only DNA.\n8. Data analysis and interpretation\nUse the formula given by eq (2) to convert the values obtained in millidegrees to mean residue ellipticity.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/63147/63147eq01.jpg  (2)\n\tHere, S is the CD signal in millidegrees, c is the DNA concentration in mg/mL, mRw is the mean residue mass, and l is the path length in cm.\nPlot a graph against wavelength and mean residue ellipticity using the data plotting software and analyze the peaks.\nTo plot the graph, select the mean residue ellipticity on the Y-axis and wavelength on the X-axis and plot a straight line graph.\n\tNOTE: This graph will provide the characteristics peaks of different forms of DNA. The forms of DNA corresponding to the peaks can be identified using existing literature6.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
