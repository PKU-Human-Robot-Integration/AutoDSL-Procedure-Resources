    "Obtain actively multiplying walnut somatic embryo cultures or initiate new cultures from zygotic embryos or anther tissue (Dandekar et al., 1989; Mendum and McGranahan, 1995; Leslie et al., 2006).Several days before initiation of transformation:Streak Agrobacterium strains out on a LB plates with appropriate antibiotics. Incubate at 28 °C for 48 h.Culture sufficient numbers of embryos of the desired genotypes.Prepare appropriate antibiotics.Make LB liquid medium.Make co-cultivation liquid medium.Make DKW basal, AS, and selection media.The day before initiation of transformation:Select embryos: Pick out 60-70 or more rapidly growing, small, white, uniform embryos (Figure 1A) and place them onto fresh DKW basal medium. Day 1 (prepare liquid cultures)Inoculate each strain of Agrobacterium to be used into a 50 ml conical centrifuge tube containing 20 ml of LB medium.Place the capped tubes on a rotary shaker at ~200 rpm at 25 °C.After 2 h add the appropriate selective antibiotics for the vector used and return to shaker.Day 2After shaking overnight, the bacterial cultures should be turbid. Determine the Abs600nm of a 10-1 dilution of the culture. For 60-70 embryos, approximately 25 ml of co-cultivation suspension will be utilized. The desired Abs600nm of the co-cultivation suspension is ~0.5 (an Abs600nm reading of 0.5 is approximately equivalent to 2.5 x 108 bacteria/ml). To calculate the needed volume of overnight culture, use the following equation:(Co-cultivation volume needed) x (desired Abs600nm of the co-cultivation suspension)(Abs600nm of the Agrobacterium culture) x (dilution factor)For example: If you need 25 ml of co-cultivation suspension at a concentration of 2.5 x 108 bacteria/ml and an aliquot of the Agrobacterium culture diluted 1: 10 gives an A600 reading of 0.371, how much of the Agrobacterium culture do you need to dilute for use?(25) x (0.5)     =   3.36 ml(0.",
    "371) x (10) Using a sterile pipette, place the calculated volume of Agrobacterium culture into a sterile plastic 50 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge for 10 min at 4,000 x g and ambient temperature to pellet the bacteria.Pour or pipette the supernatant into a waste container and resuspend the pellet in the co-cultivation medium. The pellet is easier to resuspend in a small volume (0.5 ml first) by carefully pipetting up and down, followed by bringing the solution to required final volume.Return the tubes to the rotary shaker at ~200 rpm at 25 °C for 1-2 h.Co-cultivationPlace desired number of embryos into a well of a sterile six-well multiwell plate. The well should be no more than half filled with embryos (about 20-23 embryos). Use more than one well for each transformation in case of contamination problems. Transformations of multiple genotypes can be performed in different wells of the same plate but if using multiple bacterial vectors it is advisable to use separate plates to avoid cross-contamination.   Dispense the appropriate volume of Agrobacterium co-cultivation suspension (about 8 ml, or enough to cover the embryos) into each well using sterile 10 ml pipettes with cotton-plugged ends. Incubate at ambient temperature for at least 10-15 min (Figure 1B and Note 1). Place a sterile filter paper into a number of empty sterile Petri plates equal to the number of wells used.Pipet as much excess co-cultivation liquid as possible from each well into a waste container.  Transfer the embryos from each well onto the filter paper in the Petri plates using sterile forceps. This will wick excess co-cultivation liquid from the embryos.Transfer the embryos to labeled plates of AS medium (about 10 per plate) and place the plates in the dark for 48 h at 20-22 °C (see Video 1).     <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.",
    "org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1. Walnut transformation  Day 4: Selection After co-cultivating for 48 h, transfer the embryos to plates of KAN/Timentin medium containing 200 mg/L kanamycin and 200 mg/L Timentin (see Note 2). Other selection medium may be utilized depending on the selectable marker gene (see Note 3). Incubate the culture plates in the dark at ambient temperature (20-24 °C). Day 6 and onward:Transfer embryos to fresh KAN/Timentin medium after two days and again after an additional five days. This helps to reduce bacterial overgrowth. Thereafter transfer the embryos to fresh KAN/Timentin medium weekly for 8-12 weeks.As new somatic embryos begin to develop from the surface of the original (E0) embryos, separate them from the parent embryos.  Label these new embryos as E1 embryos.  Repeat this process for one more generation (E2 embryos; Figure 1C).After 8-12 weeks of selection, embryos can be moved to selection medium containing only kanamycin. Observe the embryo cultures carefully for the next several weeks to ensure that no residual Agrobacterium has survived.Scoring for GUS expressionAs E2 embryos emerge, test them for GUS (uidA) activity (Jefferson, 1987).Pipette 40 µl of X-gluc staining solution (see recipes) into wells of a sterile 96-well multiwell plate.Using a fine point scalpel remove a small piece of tissue (cotyledon tips work well) from each well-formed and healthy E2 embryo of interest. Put the tissue piece in the X-gluc solution and label and mark the location of the embryo from which it was excised.Incubate at 37 °C and monitor the development of blue color. Color change should be apparent in 10 min to 2 h (Figure 1D).If the tissue piece developed the distinctive blue color, the E2 embryo from which it was cut should be separated and multiplied on selection medium until E3 embryos are available for DNA analysis. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141005/20141005055303_6758.jpgFigure 1.

GUS test, transformed embryos turn blue in X-Gluc solution.PCR based verification of transformationSelect actively proliferating E3 embryos from different embryo lines and use for DNA isolation.Isolate total DNA using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s protocols.Perform PCRs using appropriate primers to confirm the presence of the nptII gene (or other gene of interest). Set up the PCR reactions using 250 ng of genomic DNA in each 25 μl PCR reaction. After PCR is completed, 5 μl of PCR product is electrophoresed to verify amplification of an appropriately-sized band. DNA from untransformed embryos can be used as a negative control (Figure 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141005/20141005055331_3346.jpgFigure 2.

Negative controls or non-transformed lines does not show any bands.Somatic embryo germination and plant productionAfter verification of transformation, some E3 embryos from the desired embryo lines can be desiccated to initiate germination. Choose well-formed somatic embryos and place them in 35 x 10 mm sterile Petri plates with no medium. Cover the plates but leave them unsealed (do not wrap with Parafilm®) and place them in the dark at ambient temperature (20-24 °C) on the rack of a well-sealed desiccator containing 10-15 ml of saturated ZnSO4 or NH4NO3 in the bottom (Figure 3A). After the embryos become an opaque white (typically 2-7 days) remove the embryos from the desiccator and place them on DKW shoot medium in Magenta GA-7 vessels or Petri plates. Culture at ambient temperature under cool white fluorescent lights (16 h day length, ~100 µE) for 2 to 8 weeks.",
    "Most embryos will produce roots, but typically fewer than 10% of embryos develop shoots.  Roots will usually emerge from embryos in 7-10 days (Figure 3B).  Fully germinated embryos possessing both roots and shoots should be removed from the medium as soon as possible and planted in potting soil (for example UC Mix, 25%: 42%: 33% sand: fir bark: peat moss). Alternatively, epicotyls can be excised, micropropagated on DKW shoot medium, and then rooted to generate multiple plants. To acclimatize, keep plants on soil at 100% humidity for 2 weeks and then gradually reduce the humidity. Established plants can be repotted to larger containers as needed and maintained in a greenhouse or lath house.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20141005/20141005055435_0919.jpgFigure 3.
