    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMetabolite extraction\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step involves using a methanol-chloroform-water extraction to isolate the organic and aqueous metabolites from mucosal scrapes and feces (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nSample preparation for metabolite analysis.\nObtain mouse fecal sample.\nRestrain the mouse by holding the skin on the dorsal side of the mouse between the shoulders.\nRotate your wrist so the mouse is belly up. Gently stroke the mouse’s belly until it defecates then collect feces using sterile forceps.\nAlternatively, a 100 milligram of flash frozen human feces can be used. We used human feces from male and female participants between the ages of 18 and 80.\nPlace frozen feces on dry ice and use a sterile fresh razor blade to cut off an approximately 100 milligram portion.\nUse a sterile fresh razor blade to remove this section on dry ice. Flash freezing throughout the paper indicates rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen.\nObtain mouse mucosal colon scrapes:\nMouse mucosal scrapes from the colon can also be used at this step. Euthanize a mouse by carbon dioxide asphyxiation or other institutionally approved method of euthanasia.\nUse scissors to cut through the skin and the peritoneum of the mouse. Using forceps, isolate the colon and lift out of the abdominal cavity. Identify the large pouch of the cecum at the proximal end of the colon, and the connection of the colon to the rectum.\nTransect the colon at the anus and the cecum and remove from the body cavity. Using sharp surgical scissors, slit the colon horizontally to form a long tube.",
    "Wash thoroughly in 1× PBS and lay flat on a glass plate. Using a sterile microscope slide, gently but firmly scrape the luminal portion of the colon. Mucus and epithelial layer should be easily removed and deposited into a pre-weighed Eppendorf tube.\nAlternatively, metabolites can be isolated from the cecum of a mouse.\nThe benefits of cecal metabolites are the large abundance of material, the lack of contamination upon collection, and a snapshot of the metabolites in the more proximal colon.\nDisadvantages are the necessity of sacrificing the mouse to obtain fecal contents.\nThe cecum can be identified by the large pouch at the proximal end of the colon, which can be slit open using surgical scissors, and the contents can be directly taken and weighed.\nPause point: Samples can be stored at minus 80 degrees Celsius for up to one month.\nPreparation of organic-aqueous extraction.\nDeposit two fecal pellets, or approximately 100 milligram of tissue or feces into pre-weighed Eppendorf tube. As most tissue is frozen at this point, dry weight is used. A fecal pellet is one individual mouse poop. Reweigh tube and record weight of the sample.\nAdd 3 mL of dry ice-chilled methanol/chloroform (2:1, v:v) solution to each sample tube. Add one 1.0 mm glass homogenization bead to tube. Homogenize for 2 min using a Tissue Lyser at a rate of 20–30 Hertz.\nIncubate sample on dry ice for 10 min.\nPause point: Samples can be safely stored at minus 80 degrees Celsius for up to one month.\nCentrifuge at 16,000 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nPass the supernatant through a 70-μm cell strainer and centrifuge at 16,000 g for 10 min.",
    "Add 0.6 mL of ice-cold water per 1.5 mL of supernatant and then vortex thoroughly for at least 15 s. Centrifuge the sample at 16,000 g for 10 min to obtain phase separation in a microcentrifuge tube.\nSeparately collect the upper and lower phases into pre-weighed Eppendorf sample tubes without disturbing the interface.\nNote: Amounts of upper and lower phases are variable depending on fecal pellet quantity and extraction, but anticipate approximately 0.6 mL of upper aqueous layer and 1.4 mL of bottom organic layer.\nPlace the samples into a vacuum centrifuge and evaporate the solvent over the course of 8 h cooled to 4°C.\nConfirm that all liquid is removed.\nEnsure that there is a pellet.\nNote: Organic pellet will be a yellowish-brown color, and the aqueous pellet will be clear.\nResuspend samples in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for in vitro applications and corn oil in vivo at a concentration of 5 mg per 100 microliters as described below. Keep pellet lyophilized and store at −80°C until mass spectrometry analysis.\nCritical: Try to keep all samples on dry ice throughout the procedure. Many metabolites are volatile and are prone to evaporation if sample is warmed. Keeping reagents and samples chilled helps to prevent degradation of unstable compounds as well.\nExtraction and derivatization\nTiming: 4 and 16 h incubation\nThis step describes the extraction and derivatization methods used for volatile metabolites such as diaminopropane and reuterin.\nAn example of extraction and derivatization method for Diaminopropane (DAP).\nMix 10 mg of lyophilized sample pellet with a 150 μL volume of [2,3-13C2]-Alanine Internal Standard Solution. Homogenize at 30,000 RCF for 25 s with one 1.0 mm glass homogenization bead per sample.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4°C.",
    "Collect the supernatant in a glass vial and mix with 300 μL volume of a 50 mM sodium hydroxide solution and a 300 μL volume of a 1-propanol/pyridine (3:2, v:v) solution.\nAdd a 100 μL volume of propylchloroformate on ice and vortex for 1 min.\nThe samples were derivatized in an incubator at 35°C for 30 min, then extracted with a 75 μL volume of hexane twice.\nThe 150 μL of extract volume were stored at 4°C for headspace analysis.\nAn example of extraction and derivatization method for reuterin.\nMix 10 mg of sample with a 5 μL volume of 1 mM [2,2,4,4-D4]-]citric acid and a 500 μL volume of ice-cold methanol:water (80:20, v:v). Homogenize at 20–30 Hertz for 25 s with one 1.0 mm glass homogenization bead.\nAdd a 200 μL volume of ice-cold water and a 200 μL volume of chloroform and homogenize again.\nCentrifuge at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCollect the supernatant liquor in a glass vial and dry with a speed vac.\nMix the dried sample with a 50 μL volume of a Pyridine:MSTFA (X:X, v:v) Derivatization Solution (N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA)), and vortex-mix for 5 min.\nDerivatize the samples in a minus 20°C freezer for at least 16 h.\nSonicate the glass vial containing samples for 20 min using a probe sonicator at 20% power, then centrifuge at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nStore the extracts at 4°C for gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Samples should be used within 24 h of extraction.\nMass spectrometry analysis\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step describes the mass spectrometry protocol that we used to analyze bacterial metabolites from extracted fecal pellets.\nGC-MS Method.",
    "Use a headspace sampler (details of the one used in our protocol are in key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). Employ a HP5 ms (5% phenylmethylpolysiloxane) capillary GC column (30 m by 250 μm, with 0.25 μm film thickness, Agilent Technologies) with helium as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 mL/min.\nUse an initial column oven temperature of 70°C for 2 min, then increase to 230°C at a rate of 20°C/min.\nSet the temperature of the front inlet to 250°C, the transfer line to 280°C and the mass spec ionization source to 230°C.\nUse a total run time of 20 min and collect mass spectral data in full scan mode with a mass range m/z 30–400. Use an injection volume of 1 μL.\nRun calibration standards of diaminopropane and reuterin first.\nNote: Appropriate concentrations will vary depending on experiment, and will need to be individually determined. We used 0.1, 1, and 10 micromolar.\nQuantify diaminopropane and reuterin by peak areas of extracted m/z at 276 and 219 (Ghassempour et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Talarico and Dobrogosz, 1989[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]).\nIn vitro and in vivo applications of metabolic extract\nTiming: Variable\nThis step describes some potential applications of the metabolic extract in cell culture and in vivo mouse applications.\nIn vitro cell culture treatment:\nResuspend samples in DMSO for in vitro applications. Recommended DMSO concentration is 50 μL per 5 mg of initial dry tissue weight.\nNote: Resuspension will require significant vortex-mixing and pipetting. At this point, sub-aliquot to smaller volumes of metabolic extract in order to reduce freeze-thaw cycles.\nConcentration needed for functional cell assays must be titrated upon each extraction due to variable conditions and initial starting concentrations.",
    "Note: We found that 1 μL volumes of the suggested resuspension quantity of above extracts from wildtype mouse feces was sufficient to reduce growth of HCT116 cells by 80% on Day 3.\nNote: Use low passage HCT116, ideally under 15 passages.\nNote: We recommend performing a dose curve. We used Cytation 5 to quantify cell growth after treatment with the extract.\nIn vivo Applications:\nResuspend samples in corn oil for in vivo applications.\nNote: Recommended corn oil concentration is 100 μL of corn oil per 5 mg of initial dry tissue weight.\nInject a 200 μL volume of previously resuspended metabolites intraperitoneally into subject mice daily.\nNote: We have used the concentration of 5 mg per 100 μL for our in vivo applications, but titration may be necessary for any other application."
