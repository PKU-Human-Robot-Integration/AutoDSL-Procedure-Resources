    "1. Preparing Media, Vials, and Inoculum\nNOTE: This protocol assumes users have already calibrated the eVOLVER system and are using the Smart Sleeve configuration described in prior work16. Smart Sleeves are easily redesigned or modified, but setup details of volume and control parameters may differ for alternative configurations.\nThe day before the experiment, prepare 2 mL overnight liquid cultures of S. cerevisiae BY4741 reference strain and variant strains in YPD media (Yeast Peptone Dextrose) at 30 °C in a shaking incubator set to at least 300 r.p.m.\nTransfer sterile YPD media into clean, autoclaved bottles fitted with tubing. Alternatively, media may be autoclaved directly in bottles pre-fitted with tubing.\nNOTE: Bottles are fit with tubing by drilling a hole into the cap and running tubing through it with connectors to secure it in place. See Table of Materials.\nAdd stir bar to each vial and screw on a vial lid equipped with influx and efflux straws. Ensure that all components are clean by visual inspection.\nPlace vials in an autoclavable rack, cover with foil, and autoclave on a gravity or vacuum cycle with a 20-min sterilization step.\n2. Setting Up an Experiment\nIn three large beakers, prepare 500 mL of 10% bleach, 200 mL of 10% bleach, and 300 mL of 70% ethanol.\nUsing the switches on the eVOLVER device, turn on the 5 V power supply on the eVOLVER, wait for 5 s, then turn on the 12 V power supply.\nIf running several vials from the same media bottle, connect multiple media input lines with tubing splitters. Custom tubing splitters can be constructed with Luer components.",
    "Submerge the media input lines in the first bleach beaker, and the media efflux lines in the second bleach beaker. Place the downstream end of the media input lines in the second beaker with the efflux lines. Place waste lines into waste carboy.\nAdd 1-2 L of bleach into large empty waste carboy, which will sterilize waste generated during experiment. Consult with a safety coordinator to ensure proper disposal of waste.\nUsing the touchscreen on the eVOLVER, navigate to the setup section, and run all pumps for 20 s to fill fluid lines with 10% bleach. While running, ensure by visual inspection that all lines have been filled and that pumps are operating normally. Allow bleach to sit in the lines for at least 30 min to sterilize.\nRun pumps again using the touchscreen app until lines are no longer submerged, pushing air through the lines to get as much of the bleach out as possible.\nPlace media input lines in the ethanol beaker and repeat as in above, filling the lines with ethanol and flushing with air.\nNOTE: As ethanol kills quickly, there is no need to wait 30 min for sterilization.\nAttach media input lines to the media bottles with the Luer connectors and run the pumps until the media fully runs through the lines, flushing out any residual ethanol.\nPartially insert sterilized vials into the eVOLVER Smart Sleeves and hook up the lines to the proper positions, according to the color coding on the lines. Start by attaching input lines to the short influx straw, and then waste lines to the long efflux straw.\nCAUTION: It is critical to check for loose connections or incorrectly routed lines. Failure to do so will cause overflows and potentially damage the Smart Sleeve.",
    "Run all pumps in 10 s increments to fill the vials with media. Ensure by visual inspection efflux pumps are efficiently removing media through the efflux straws, to prevent overflows. If the efflux straws do not appear to be functioning efficiently, inspect the fluidic line connections and the peristaltic pump. Correct or replace parts as needed.\nPush vials down until fully encased by the Smart Sleeve.\nSet the initial conditions for experimental parameters using the eVOLVER touchscreen on the interactive setup page. For all vials, set the temperature to 30 °C and the stir to 10. This can be done for all vials at once by dragging a finger across the touchscreen to select all of the vials.\n3. Configuring eVOLVER Software and Programming Algorithmic Culture Routines\nIn the eVOLVER dashboard on a computer, navigate to the experiment manager page. Select the base experiment in the experiment navigator panel or an existing experiment as a starting point and click clone new.\nNOTE: It is possible to use experiments from other groups by pasting the GitHub link to the repo where the experimental definition is saved into the experiment manager.\nSpecify the experiment name and the eVOLVER device that the experiment will be run on. Be sure that the desired calibration settings have been selected by modifying these fields on the page.\nUse the vial selector and parameter definition panes to set experimental conditions. For example, to set the temperature for vials 0-4 to 30 °C, select the vials in the vial selector, set the parameter definition to 30, and click Set. Repeat this for OD to set an upper and lower threshold for each vial.\nAfter experimental parameter definitions complete, save the experiment by clicking Save and click Start to run.\n4. Initiating Experiment and Monitoring in Real-time",
    "Once the experiment is underway, navigate to the real-time data panel in the interactive dashboard. For each vial, check that OD values are holding at zero, and that temperatures are at or progressing towards programmed levels by browsing through the graphs.\nTo prepare inoculum, measure the OD of overnight cultures, calculate the desired fold dilution assuming a vial volume of 25 mL, and pipette calculated volume of inoculum into vials through the sampling port. For example, to reach a desired starting OD of about 0.05 in the culture vial from overnight cultures that are at OD 2.0, 625 μL of cells should be added to each vial.\nCheck the graphs on the dashboard to see that the OD graphs have been updated accordingly. An increase to near the desired starting OD should be seen in the graphs.\nTrack different data types (such as OD, temperature, growth rate, generations, and media consumption) throughout the experiment by browsing through the corresponding graphs in the dashboard. These values may inform experimental decisions by the user (e.g. schedule timepoints) or even used in functions to perform automated feedback.\nTo replace media bottles mid experiment, pause the experiment in the experiment manager panel to prevent pump events from occurring. Quickly unscrew the media line from the empty bottle and connect it to the new bottle. Avoid touching the ends of tubing to prevent contamination. Resume the experiment in the experiment manager.\n5. Sampling Yeast Cells from eVOLVER Vials\nPrepare a cycloheximide solution to inhibit protein synthesis and fix yeast cells for flow cytometry analysis. In a 15 mL conical tube, add 12 mL of PBS and 12 μL of 20 mg/mL cycloheximide and vortex for 5 s.\nUsing a multichannel pipette, aliquot 100 μL into each well of a 96-well round bottom plate.",
    "Wrap the plate in aluminum foil to block out light and keep at 4 °C until needed.\nTo sample, pipette through the sampling port on the vial lid using extended length 200 μL tips.\nPipette 100 μL from a vial into a well in the fixation plate, mixing 2-3x by pipetting up and down, then recover in foil and return the plate to 4 °C.\n6. Experiment Break Down and Clean Up\nPrepare 1 L of 10% bleach and two 500 mL DI water solutions in large beakers.\nStop the experiment by sending the stop command in the experiment manager panel. The data is still stored in the cloud-enabled database, and can still be viewed later in the real-time data panel of the dashboard, or downloaded for offline analysis.\nRemove vials from Smart Sleeves and place them in an autoclave rack to avoid overflows in subsequent steps.\nUnscrew the media input lines from the media bottles and place them into the beaker of 10% bleach. Run pumps from the eVOLVER user interface as in setup to sterilize lines and vials.\nDisconnect lines from vials and submerge lines in DI water. Run pumps to flush all bleach out of the system first with DI water, then with air.\nTurn off eVOLVER by first switching off the 12 V power supply, waiting 5 s, and then turning off the 5 V power supply.\nSoak stir bars and caps in 10% bleach, then rinse with DI water. Be sure to rinse the influx and efflux straws of each cap by running DI water through them. Scrub vials using test tube brush if film has formed on walls.\nDispose of waste appropriately and rinse waste containers thoroughly.",
    "CAUTION: Waste containers will contain a mixture of 10% bleach, sterilized cell culture waste, and trace amounts of ethanol. Consult a safety coordinator for proper handling and disposal.\n7. Quantifying Fitness Using Flow Cytometry Analysis of Fractional Populations\nAnalyze collected samples from section 5 using a flow cytometer equipped with the appropriate fluorescence channel and detectors16.\nAcquire at least 10,000 events per sample, and gate for intact cells using the forward and side scatter data.\nGate based on the appropriate fluorescence channel (e.g. GFP) to determine the fractional distribution of each population.\nOn a computer, save data to desired location from the Experiment Manager page by clicking the “Export” button.\nFrom the eVOLVER data files, determine the number of generations completed by each timepoint for each vial. In the eVOLVER code, generations are calculated by first segmenting the OD data between each dilution event, then each segment is fit with a basic exponential of the form imgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59652/59652eq1.jpg to each segment, yielding r, the growth rate16. The number of generations over a time period is then calculated using the following formula:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59652/59652eq2v2.jpg\nPlot the log-ratio of the labelled and unlabeled populations from the flow cytometry data vs generation number from the above calculations at the time samples were taken. Identify the linear region and fit the slope according to the following equation. This slope is commonly defined as the competitive fitness18,19.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59652/59652eq3v2.jpg"
