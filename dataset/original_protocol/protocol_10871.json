    "Note: Pre-Amplification is necessary to enhance signal strength, especially when starting concentration of RNA is limited. The input RNA level determines the optimal number of Pre-PCR cycles. Given the same relative efficiency each PCR cycle should double the concentration of the final product. Since some miRNAs will be more highly expressed, avoid over cycling. However, under-amplification can result in a loss of detection sensitivity, especially for microRNAs expressed at low levels. In our hands 12 pre amplification cycles, using 100ng of total RNA, appeared sufficient. Using serum as starting material, 12 cycles results in detectable miRNA levels, but 15 cycles appeared to be superior. Finally, starting with 3 oocytes (roughly 400 pg total RNA per oocyte3), 16 pre-amplification cycles successfully allowed us to screen for microRNA expression levels4.\n* List of forward primers can be found at http://urology.ucsf.edu/blellochlab/protocols.htm[href=http://urology.ucsf.edu/blellochlab/protocols.htm] \nPrepare Master-Mix (Volumes per reaction) as follows:\ntable:\n﻿0,1\n1. 2x Universal MM,13.75 μl\n2.
