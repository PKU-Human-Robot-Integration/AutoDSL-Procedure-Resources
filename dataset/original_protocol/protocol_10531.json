    "1. Flow Cell Setup and Inoculation\nNOTE: Use a double-inlet microfluidic flow cell described in Song et al., 201414 to grow biofilms. This flow cell is able to create well-defined smooth chemical gradients. The flow cell design is shown in Figure 1 and flow cell fabrication was previously described in Song et al., 201414. Here we detail our methods by using P. aeruginosa and E. coli to form biofilms, but other species may be suitable too. We used P. aeruginosa PAO1-gfp, which constitutively expresses a green fluorescent protein (GFP), as a model organism for biofilm development. Additionally, we used E. coli DH5α to form mixed-species biofilms with P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa and E. coli strains were grown on LB agar plates.\nPrepare the flow cell using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) bound to a glass coverslip via oxygen plasma treatment as described in14. The dimensions of the flow cell chamber are 23 mm × 13 mm × 0.24 mm (length × width × depth).\nPrepare modified FAB growth medium15. To observe biofilm growth under a nutritional gradient within the flow cell, introduce modified FAB medium15 with 0.6 μM glucose in one inlet and introduce FAB medium without any carbon source through the other inlet. Filter-sterilize (pore size = 0.2 μm) the glucose stock solution (60 mM) before adding it to the FAB medium. Also autoclave the FAB medium with cycle 1 (liquid, 15 min; 121 °C, 17 psi) before use.",
    "Sterilize the flow system. Prior to inoculation, autoclave the entire flow path (medium bottles, tubing, bubble traps, flow cells) using cycle 1, except for the plastic three-way valves (disposable and pre-sterilized) located upstream of the flow cell. (Three-ways valves are used for injecting cell culture, fluorescent tracer and microbeads.) To avoid contamination during assembly, cover all the tubing and connector openings with aluminum foil or autoclave bags before autoclaving.\nConnect the flow system. Assemble the components of the flow cell system carefully (see video for flow system assembly) and deliver growth medium to the flow cell via a peristaltic pump that precisely controls the flow rate.\nPrepare cell culture for inoculation by transferring a colony of P. aeruginosa or E. coli from LB plates to 3 ml of LB broth and shake the culture O/N at 225 rpm and 37 °C. Dilute the O/N cell cultures in 1 ml sterilized water to a final OD600 = 0.01 as the inoculum. (Culture and dilute the bacteria in a laminar flow hood to avoid contamination.)\nFor the experiments with mixed-species biofilms, dilute the two bacterial cultures to a ratio of 1:1 in 1 ml with an equivalent OD600 = 0.01 for each bacterium.\nInoculate the flow cell. Inject 1 ml of the inoculum to the flow cell inlet from the three-way valve. After the injection, pause the flow for 1 hr to allow bacterial cells to attach to the cover glass. (Make sure that the flow cell is placed with the coverslip side down to allow suspended cells to settle onto the coverslip.)\nAfter 1 hr, resume the flow and pump the growth medium to the flow cell at a constant rate of 0.03 ml/min for each inlet for 3 days.",
    "2. Characterizing Biofilm Development in Response to Nutrient Gradients Using Confocal Microscopy\nNOTE: P. aeruginosa can be imaged with constitutively-expressed GFP, but E. coli in mixed-species biofilms must be imaged by counterstaining.\nObserve the 3-day biofilms using confocal microscopy. For the representative results, observe biofilms using a confocal microscope with a 63X objective. Prior to imaging, mark the double-inlet flow cell with a grid on the cover glass side. (The purpose of this grid is to allow the experimenter to locate the imaging regions within the flow cell chamber.)\nTo counterstain, dilute 10 μl of cell-permeant red fluorescent nucleic acid stain, such as green fluorescent nucleic acid stain such as STYO 62, stock solution (1 mM) in 990 μl sterilized water and then slowly inject the diluted stain using a syringe into the flow cell chamber from the upstream three-way valve. Keep the flow cell stagnant and in the dark for 30 min, then resume the flow to wash out the unbound stain for 15 min.\nPerform confocal imaging. Activate the 488 nm Argon laser for excitation and the emission collecting channels for GFP (500-535 nm) and nucleic acid stain (for green fluorescent nucleic acid stain, 650-750 nm). Adjust gains and offsets for both channels to have bright and clean images. Select xyz and simultaneous imaging mode. Use the z-control knob to identify the bottom and top of the biofilm in the field. Set the z-step to 0.5 μm for acquiring a 3-D image stack. (To ensure high image quality, use a line average of four for image acquisition.)",
    "To map the spatial patterns of biofilm development within the flow cell, image biofilms at three or more longitudinal (x) distances along the flow cell inlet, and at three transverse (y) positions relative to the imposed nutritional gradient, as shown in Figure 1.\n3. Characterizing Internal Solute Transport by Injections of Conservative Fluorescent Tracer\nNOTE: A conservative fluorescent tracer, such as Cy5, can be used to characterize solute transport patterns within the biofilm.\nDissolve Cy5 (Mono-Reactive NHS Ester) in water to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml as a stock solution. Store the Cy5 stock solution in a -20 °C freezer.\n\tNOTE: As Cy5 is light-sensitive, store, dilute and inject Cy5 solutions in the dark.\nPrior to the injections of the fluorescent tracer, take a 3-D image stack of the 3-day biofilm with confocal microscopy (with a 63X objective). (Wide regions of biofilm colonies are ideal for time-series observations of dye transport.) Also choose a z-plane with well-separated colonies for imaging (as shown in Figure 5A).\nFor each Cy5 injection experiment, dilute 2 μl of the Cy5 stock solution in 998 μl sterilized water to yield an injection solution having a Cy5 concentration of 20 μg/ml.\nStop the pump to pause the flow and inject the Cy5 solution into the upstream of the flow cell using a syringe via the 3-way valve. (It is important to prevent air bubbles from entering the flow path while injecting. Bubble traps should be kept open during the back injection.)\nAfter injecting the Cy5 solution, close the bubble traps, adjust the 3-way valve, and restart the pump to deliver the injected Cy5 solution into the flow cell.",
    "Switch confocal imaging mode to xyt. Activate Cy5 and GFP channels under simultaneous imaging mode. Adjust confocal settings on Cy5 intensity (laser intensity, gain and offset) to avoid saturating signals, which is critical for quantification. (High temporal resolution is preferred for visualizing dye penetration. However, fast scanning decreases image quality.) Choose proper scanning speed and line average to balance the time resolution of imaging and the image quality. For this protocol use a line average of four and a frame rate of 0.15 Hz.\nResume the flow to deliver Cy5 into the flow cell (still at a flow rate of 0.03 ml/min). Simultaneously start time-series confocal imaging.\nQuantify Cy5 penetration by radially averaging Cy5 intensity within a 2-D circular biofilm colony. To average, first identify the edge of a biofilm cluster, then generate a distance map for a 2-D section of the cluster, and finally average radial patterns of Cy5 intensities to generate a penetration curve (see Figure 6).\n\t\nTo computationally realize step 3.8, use BioSPA (Biofilm Spatial Pattern Analysis) software package (unpublished, software package and manual available upon request) or other image analysis programs.\nTo use BioSPA, first import an image set into BioSPA. Then select proper threshold for GFP and Cy5 channels to make binary images. In the analysis/calculation menu, select Advanced Analysis and then Diffusion Analysis. Use the GFP channel to define the edge of a cluster and use the polygon tool to select one cluster as the region of interest (ROI).\nDouble click the selected biofilm cluster to perform diffusion analysis. Save the diffusion analysis results and calibrate Cy5 intensity to Cy5 concentration using a calibration curve.\n\t\t\nTo generate Cy5 concentration calibration curve, measure Cy5 intensities over a Cy5 concentration gradient under confocal microscopy. (Cy5 intensity and concentration have a linear relationship.)",
    "4. Characterizing the Surrounding Flow Field by Tracking Fluorescent Particles\nNOTE: Fluorescent particles, such as fluorescent microbeads, can be used to characterize the flow field around biofilms. Flow field around biofilms can be calculated from the time-series observations of particle positions using particle tracking velocimetry software. The results shown here were obtained with the Streams 2.02 software package16 (software download and user’s guide available at http://www.civil.canterbury.ac.nz/streams.shtml[href=http://www.civil.canterbury.ac.nz/streams.shtml]).\nDilute the fluorescent microbeads (diameter ~1 μm) in sterilized water to a final solid concentration of 0.2% and a final volume of 0.5 ml. Vortex to make sure that the microbeads are well dispersed.\nInject and deliver the diluted fluorescent microbeads into the flow cell following procedures from steps 3.3 to 3.5. To allow an accurate tracking of the particle path, use a relatively low flow rate (0.01 ml/hr for the particle tracking results in this paper).\nSwitch confocal settings to xyt mode to track particle movement at one z-slice and take time-series images. (A frame rate of 1 Hz was used for the representative results shown in this paper.) Repeat particle injection and image at different z locations to generate 3-D flow field.\nPre-process the time-series confocal images by subtracting the background fluorescence signal (the signal in the first acquired image of the image set) using ImageJ (software download and manual available on http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/[href=http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/]) or other programs.\nIn ImageJ, open the first image of an image set and then import the image set. Under Process / Image Calculator, subtract the first image from the image set. Save the pre-processed image set.\nTo calculate flow vectors, import time-series confocal images in Streams 2.02. Under “Open process view”, select and execute “Identify particles”. Use proper threshold to identify particles. Use 0.5 and 5 μm as minimum and maximum diameter thresholds for 1 μm particles.",
    "Then under “Open process view”, select and execute “PTV analysis pipeline” to generate particle paths. Check the particle paths to see if they represent particle movement. Finally, select and execute “Create velocity field” to generate a flow vector map.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
