    "The following protocol adheres to guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (IACUC Protocol #0415011, approved June 18, 2015).\n1. Gavaging Mice with 19F-Labeled Bile Acids\nGavage mice with 150 mg/kg body weight 19F-labeled bile acids. Fill a 1-ml syringe to the necessary volume with 19F-labeled bile acid stock solution [cholic acid-trifluoro-acetyl lysine (CA-lys-TFA; in 1:1 polyethylene glycol 400:Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline) or cholylsarcosine-trifluoro-N-methyl-acetamide (CA-sar-TFMA; in 60% polyethylene glycol 400 and 40% Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline] and attach a 20-gauge 1.5-inch curved bulb-tipped gastric gavage needle. Make sure the gavage needle is long enough to reach the level of the mouse’s xyphoid cartilage when inserted in the esophagus up to the hub of the needle\nFirmly grasp the animal by the loose skin at the back of the neck between the thumb and index finger and use the remaining fingers to grasp the skin on the lower back and tail.\nHold the mouse upright and pass the gavage needle along the side and the roof of the mouth into the esophagus and down into the stomach. If resistance is encountered at the pharynx, reposition the needle until the animal 'swallows' it — do not push against resistance.\nIf anesthesia is required for gavage, place the mouse in a bell jar containing 5 ml isoflurane and close. When the mouse falls on its side, wait 7 sec, remove the mouse and perform gavage. To protect personnel from anesthetic vapors, use the bell jar only in a fume hood.\nObserve the animal recover from isoflurane in a few min.",
    "NOTE: Since isoflurane is metabolized by the liver, a fluorine signal emanating from intact drug or its metabolites excreted into the biliary system and gallbladder can confound fluorine signals from 19F-labeled bile acids15. An alternative is to use ketamine plus xylazine (see section 3.1 for doses).\n2. Harvesting the Gallbladder, the Liver and Blood for Bile Acid Measurements Using Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry\nTo achieve maximal gallbladder filling, fast mice for at least 6 hr before harvesting the organs. Prepare ketamine and xylazine in phosphate-buffered saline (100 µl ketamine, 62.5 µl xylazine, 840 µl PBS).\nUsing a 1-ml sterile syringe, inject a mouse subcutaneously 1 hr prior to organ harvest with 15 µl/g body weight of ketamine/xylazine solution (150 mg ketamine and 18 mg xylazine per kg body weight).\nOne hr after administering ketamine/xylazine confirm adequate anesthesia by toe pinch and place the anesthetized mouse supine.\nUse 5 or 6 inch scissors to make a midline abdominal skin incision from the pubis to the xyphoid and fine scissors (4 inch) to cut the peritoneal lining and expose abdominal organs — do not to pierce the diaphragm.\nGrasp the xyphoid process with a 5 inch clamp and lift back across the chest to expose the upper abdominal cavity. Use forceps and a blunt instrument to dissect and move the liver aside, exposing the gallbladder.\n\tNOTE: Do not lacerate the liver or touch the gallbladder as the former will cause severe bleeding and the latter may stimulate gallbladder contraction and emptying.\nPlace a 4-inch clamp across the common bile duct (Figure 3, dashed arrows). Cut the ligament attaching the superior pole of the gallbladder to the diaphragm and gently move the gallbladder to the right side of the abdomen.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54597/54597fig3.jpg\nFigure 3: Anatomical and Proton MRI Views of the Mouse Gallbladder.",
    "The left panel shows the exposed mouse gallbladder to the left of midline after abdominal incision. The clamp grasps the xyphoid process. The bile-filled fasting gallbladder is indicated by the large arrow and the clamped common bile duct by the dashed arrows. [Inset: Excised intact gallbladder with the common bile duct clamped.

At the point of maximal cardiac pulsation puncture the diaphragm and heart with a 23-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml syringe.\n\t\nSlowly withdraw the syringe while aspirating. When blood starts to fill the syringe, stop withdrawing and maintain suction to collect 0.2 - 0.6 ml blood. Gently rotating the needle or withdrawing it slightly may re-establish flow if it ceases.\nTransfer the blood to a 1.5-ml heparinized tube and centrifuge at 2,000 x g for 15 min. Precipitate the plasma with four parts acetonitrile and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min. Analyze the supernatant by liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC/MS/MS)11-1312-1412-1412-1412-14. If necessary, store the plasma at -80 oC before analysis.\nUsing blunt dissection, free the gallbladder from the liver. Transect the common bile duct below the clamp, remove and weigh the gallbladder, and place it in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Harvest the liver.",
    "Homogenize approximately 100 mg of liver and the entire gallbladder on ice in a size-21 glass tissue homogenizer. Extract with 75% acetonitrile and 25% water (800 µl for liver, 300 µl for gallbladder) and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10 min. Dilute extracts as necessary and quantify bile acid contents using LC/MS/MS11-13.\n3. Live Animal Proton (1H) and Fluorine (19F) Magnetic Resonance Imaging\nTo achieve maximal gallbladder filling, fast mice for at least 6 hr before imaging. Using ketamine and xylazine, anesthetize mice to prevent motion in the MRI scanner. Prepare a stock solution of ketamine plus xylazine in phosphate buffered saline (130 µl ketamine, 42.5 µl xylazine, 827 µl PBS). One hr before MRI, use a 1-ml sterile syringe to inject a mouse subcutaneously with 5 µl/g body weight of this solution (65 mg ketamine and 4.25 mg xylazine per kg body weight). To prevent dryness under anesthesia apply veterinary ointment to the animal's eyes.\nAfter induction with ketamine/xylazine as above, clip a 1.5 cm2 area on left lower half of the mouse abdomen using #40 or finer electric clipper blades. After fur removal, prep the area with 8 - 12% diluted iodine surgical scrub solution and rinse with 70% alcohol — repeat both steps. Insert a 24-gauge by 0.75-inch needle/catheter subcutaneously and tunnel into the abdominal cavity. Make sure the catheter is not in the cecum or other abdominal organ by pulling back on the plunger — there should be no blood or fecal material in the catheter.\nRemove the needle and leave the intraperitoneal catheter. Place the mouse on a temperature-controlled thermal pad in the MRI scanner animal chamber.",
    "Prepare a 1-ml sterile syringe containing ketamine and xylazine in phosphate buffered saline (1,000 µl ketamine, 300 µl xylazine, 6,700 µl PBS) and fill the desired length of 72-inch sterile tubing. Connect the intraperitoneal catheter to the prefilled sterile tubing and extend it away from the MRI scanner. To maintain anesthesia inject 50 µl of this solution every 20 min if the mouse’s vital signs are stable.\n\t​NOTE: Before imaging, make certain no metals are near the MRI scanner.\nUse a 19F/1H dual-tuned linear volume MRI coil to transmit and receive radio frequency signals at 300.283 MHz for 1H and 282.524 MHz for 19F nuclei.\n\t\nPerform system calibration11, 13 and animal localization with three-slice (axial, mid-sagittal, and coronal) scout images using a fast low-angle shot sequence (FLASH). To start the experiment, click the 'traffic light' button in the Scan Control window on the software console.\nAcquire multislice 1H MR images using rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (RARE) sequence in the cross view of the sample or the body of the animal with repetition time 2,200 msec, echo time 8.9 msec, RARE factor 8, field of view 4 x 4 cm2, slice thickness 1.0 mm, matrix size 266 x 266, in-plane resolution 150 x 150 µm2, and number of averages 6. To start the experiment, click the 'traffic light' button in the Scan Control window on the software console.\nAcquire 19F images using a FLASH sequence in the same region of the 1H MRI with repetition time 220 ms, flip angle = 30°, echo time 3.078 ms, matrix size 32 x 32, in-plane resolution 1.25 x 1.25 mm2, slice thickness 4.0 mm, and number of averages 768. To start the experiment, click the 'GOP' (Go- On- Pipeline) button in the Spectrometer Control Tool window on the software console.",
    "After MRI, euthanize the mouse with intraperitoneal injection of 15 µl/g body weight ketamine/xylazine solution (150 mg ketamine/18 mg xylazine per kg body weight) followed by cardiac puncture for exsanguination.\nTo recover a mouse from anesthesia, remove the intraperitoneal catheter but do not leave the animal unattended until it regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\nTo measure 19F-labeled bile acid concentrations11-13 from organ harvest, maintain anesthesia with ketamine plus xylazine as described above.\nSubscription Required.
