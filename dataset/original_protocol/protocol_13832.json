    "The protocol follows the guidelines of the institution's human research ethics committee and the patients of the clinical cases gave their written informed consent to the study.\n1. Technical requirements\nFor 3D acquisition and analysis, use appropriate software and hardware. Use ECG cables of the echocardiography device; moreover, it is mandatory for the complete 3D acquisition protocol described below.\nFor 3D acquisition, use a 3D echocardiographic probe and 3D-compatible ultrasound machine. For 3D RV volumetric analysis, use dedicated software.\n2. Acquisition\nIn the vast majority of cases, perform 3D acquisition of the RV using apical views. In opposed to the LV-focused views, a different patient positioning is recommended. If substantially better image quality can be achieved by switching to one intercostal space over the correct apical view, this foreshortened view may enable better 3D image quality. The foreshortening can be corrected during 3D analysis.\n\t\nCompared to the standard apical echocardiographic acquisition, where the left lateral decubitus position (patient lying on the left side with the left arm stretched above the head) is recommended, have the patient lean back slightly more to enable a more lateral position of the transducer.\nChoose an image depth that only includes the RV. Unnecessarily large depth may lower the acquisition frame rate with the lack of beneficial effects regarding RV volumetric analysis.\nConfirm the correct RV-focused view from 2D echocardiography images. If the free wall of the RV is poorly visualized even from this view, the expected 3D image quality will not be optimal for further analysis.\nSwitch to the live 3D imaging using the 4D button, where further correction of the RV view can be performed.",
    "While the 3D live mode may be quite pleasing aesthetically, use the 12 Slice mode for the 3D view, which shows a triplane image of the region of interest as well as 9 cross-sectional planes that can be freely modified. By rotation and correct positioning of the cut planes, confirm the visibility of the entire RV free wall (including the outflow tract and apical segments).\nFurther adjust the image by using the left tilting of the sector (second page on the touch screen) to improve RV visualization.\nUse two 3D acquisition modes for RV volumetric analysis: the multi beat and the single beat mode. Use both of these approaches in every patient however, in some cases (e.g., certain arrhythmias, severe dyspnea of the patient), only the latter one may be feasible.\nUsing single beat mode, achieve a tradeoff between image quality and frame rate. Choose an optimal image depth, width, and frame rate (lower panel of the touch screen) and obtain 3D loops of the RV without any further action. This method is feasible in the majority of patients; however, it yields generally lower image quality and frame rate compared to the multi beat approach.\n\t\nIn case of an average (60-70/min) heart rate, keep a lower frame rate limit of 16 frames/s for adequate RV analysis; however, if tachycardia is present even higher frame rates are recommended.",
    "Using the multi beat mode, reconstruct the acquired 3D loop from a given number of heart cycles that can be selected on the touch screen (2,3,4 and 6 beat modes can be used). In contrast with the single beat acquisition, generally better image quality and frame rate are expected; however, it requires relatively constant heart cycle lengths and also patient compliance due to the mandatory breath-hold maneuver. The maneuver is essential to avoid the so-called stitching artefacts: when the acquired 3D volume is stitched together, unequal cardiac cycle lengths and/or motion due to breathing may result in this phenomenon.\n\t\nAfter correct positioning of the probe and setting of the machine (similarly to \"single beat\" mode), ask the patient to take a deep breath and hold it. In this case, the expanding lungs usually cover the entire image.\nAsk the patient to exhale slowly, strictly with guidance. In parallel with the deflation of the lungs, the RV becomes visible again.\nWhen the entire RV (free wall and septum) reappears, ask the patient to hold breath in this state.\nBy clicking to multi beat on the screen, begin the acquisition, and the 3D loop builds up during the given amount of heart cycles.\nWhen the acquisition is ready (the entire RV is visualized), ask the patient to breathe freely again.\nCheck the obtained loop to ensure if there are no stitching or drop-out artifacts.\n3. 4D RV analysis\nUsing dedicated software, perform 3D volumetric analysis of the RV. After choosing the RV-focused 3D loop from the patient library, open the software from the Measurement window found in the Volume folder.\nAfter opening the software, orient the RV on four predefined cut planes.",
    "Put two markers (TV Center) to the center of the tricuspid valve in the upper and lower left long-axis planes. Adjust the long-axis of the image to the actual long axis of the RV by using the rotation tool. Reference images on the upper right edges show how the correct orientation should appear.\nOn the upper and lower right panels, align the short-axis images into the correct position by rotation. Similarly to the previous step, reference images help in this process as well.\nAfter finishing, click Set landmarks to the next step of the analysis. Set landmarks in two images.\n\t\nOn the left side, mark the tricuspid annulus at the free wall (TV free wall) and septum (TV septum) and the RV apex on the previously oriented apical four-chamber view.\nOn the right side, set the RV posterior (LV/RV posterior) and anterior insertion points (LV/RV anterior) and the RV free wall (RV free wall). Similarly to the previous window, reference images in the upper right corner help regarding the correct setup. After setting all landmarks, the software automatically jumps to the next window (Review).\nIn this window (Review), review and manually correct the automatic endocardial border detection throughout the entire cardiac cycle, if necessary. By default, 9 panels can be seen: on the left side, 3 moving loops (1 long-axis and 2 short-axis), on the middle the end-diastolic frames of the same images, and on the right side the end-systolic ones.",
    "In the case of false tracking, freely correct the endocardial borders (green lines), the tracked border by clicking on them. Using the rotation tool on the short axis, review images tracking along the entire circumference of the RV. Adjust the magnitude of correction by choosing Pen size on the right side panel. If the tracking is considered to be correct, click on the Results in the same panel.\nIn the last section, review the final 3D volumetric data and other calculated parameters on the upper right side (Worksheet panel). Beyond RV volumes and ejection fraction, the software also displays 2D parameters, such as linear (mid, basal, and long-axis) diameters, as well as FAC and TAPSE values derived from the predefined apical four-chamber view. The software also shows a long- and short axis of the RV (left side), a 3D live model of the RV (upper middle), and a volume-time curve of the chamber (lower right).\n\t\nIn case of the need for further adjustments in the tracking, every previous steps are available for correction by clicking on them on the right panel. If the tracking and the 3D parameters are considered to be valid, save the results by clicking on \"Approve and exit\" on the same panel.\nSubscription Required.
