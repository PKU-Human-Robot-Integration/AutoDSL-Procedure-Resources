    "Prepare 25 ml of NG agar in a flask per a standard recipe (see below) (Stiernagle, 2006). Include a stir bar.Autoclave NG agar using a liquid cycle set at 121 °C and 15 psi pressure for at least 30 min. Cool the NG agar. Add the post-autoclave ingredients from sterile stocks (see Recipes below) and stir on a hot-plate (Figure 1A). Once all ingredients have been mixed, add the dye. Tested dyes have been verified to work at a final concentration of 2 μM. Different concentrations may work for other dyes; when trying new dyes, it is a good idea to compare test plates of various dye concentrations for staining efficiency. Using less dye allows more plates to be made from the same starting amount of dye, which is cost-effective. However, a lower dye concentration also results in weaker staining, so the trade-off must be assessed for each dye.After the dye is added to the medium, stir on a hot-plate until the dye is evenly distributed (Figure 1B). Pipet 5 ml of the dyed medium into 35-mm Petri dishes. You will be able to make 5 plates in total (Figure 1C).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181031/20181031011518_0780.jpgFigure 1.

Note the pink color. C. 35-mm Petri dishes each with 5 ml LysoTracker-containing NG agar.Put plates in a foiled container and dry at room temperature for at least 2 days. If plates are needed sooner, they can be dried in a hood (with the light off).Streak out E. coli OP50 on to an LB agar plate without antibiotics. It is important to streak to single colonies to ensure purity. Grow at 37 °C overnight.",
    "The next day, check the LB agar plate for OP50 colonies and possible contaminants. If OP50 colonies, but no contaminants, have grown, pick a single OP50 colony and inoculate a 5 ml LB liquid culture. Incubate with shaking at 37 °C overnight.Overnight growth will produce a saturated OP50 culture (~108-109 CPU/ml). Transfer 500 μl of the saturated OP50 culture to a microcentrifuge tube and add the same dye that was previously added to the NG agar plates (Figure 2A). Use the same final concentration of the dye as before.Aliquot 100 μl of the dyed OP50 culture on to the center of the dyed NG agar plates (Figure 2B). Keep plates in a foiled container at room temperature for at least 2 days. Bacteria will form a lawn. Plates can be maintained in a covered container for up to 1 week at room temperature, and are suitable for use as long as they do not dry out and crack.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181031/20181031011534_7901.jpgFigure 2. Preparation of dyed bacteria. A. OP50 aliquots with (+) or without (-) LysoTracker Red DND-99. B. Two LysoTracker plates with 100 μl OP50 spotted in the center.For most robust staining, transfer worms to the bacterial lawns as eggs or L1 larvae. C. elegans eggs can be isolated by bleaching. For bleaching, gravid adult worms should be collected. Rinse plates with M9 buffer to collect the worms, and transfer the worms into a 15 ml Falcon tube. Centrifuge at 200 x g for 30 sec to pellet the worms. Remove the M9 buffer, and add 5 ml of fresh worm bleaching solution. Vortex for 5 min to dissolve the animals and release the eggs. Add 5 ml M9 buffer and invert the tube to mix.",
    "Pellet the released eggs at 200 x g for 30 sec, and wash the eggs three times with 5 ml M9 buffer. Plate the eggs directly, or nutate the eggs overnight in M9 buffer to allow the worms to develop into L1 larvae before plating. Either approach is suitable for this application. Introduce about 50 eggs/animals per plate; if more worms are included, the bacterial food source may be exhausted before worms reach adulthood.Put the foiled container with the worm plates into an appropriate incubator. For standard staining, incubation at 20 °C is suitable. When expression of germline transgenes is also desired, incubate at 25 °C to prevent germline silencing (Merritt et al., 2010). Allow the worms to develop into young adults (from the embryo stage, this will take around 3 days, depending on the incubation temperature).Make 1 mm-thick 4% agarose pads that can be used to mount the worms for microscopy. First, separate the two halves of an empty 1 mm gel cassette. Then, melt 1 g of agarose in 25 ml H2O in a glass beaker or flask. Before the agarose solidifies, pour the agarose on to the flat inside surface of one of the cassette halves, and compress the agarose to 1 mm thickness using the other cassette half. Once the agarose solidifies, pull the two halves of the cassette apart; a 1 mm-thick sheet of agarose should stick to one half of the cassette. Use a razor to cut the agarose into small square pads. Place an agarose pad onto a microscope slide and add a drop of 2 mM levamisole (a paralyzing agent used to immobilize worms). Transfer young-adult worms to the levamisole drop and place a coverslip on top. Secure the slide to the stage of a confocal microscope.",
    "Use appropriate filter sets to image the fluorophore of interest (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20181031/20181031011557_8701.jpgFigure 3.

LysoTracker-positive puncta develop in maturing oocytes as they approach sperm (sp). Note that other tissues are also stained. Scale bar = 10 μm."
