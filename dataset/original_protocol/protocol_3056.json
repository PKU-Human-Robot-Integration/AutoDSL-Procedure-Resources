    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nGrow the SARS-CoV-2 virus\nTiming: 9 days\nThis step will provide you with virus stocks for use in co-infection assays. Previously generated stocks can also be used, provided they have been grown without antibiotics.\nNote: All work in steps 4 and 5 should be performed in a CL3 laboratory.\nDay 1 – Set up cells as per steps 1–3.\nPrepare 175 cm2 flasks of Vero E6 cells, seeding them so that they would be 95%–100% confluent in 48 h. Include an additional 25 cm2 flask to be used as a negative control (mock infection). Seed flasks with at 1 × 105 cells/mL, using 5 mL for the 25 cm2 flask and 35 mL for the 175 cm2 flask.\nNote: Vero E6 cells are used for most variants of SARS-CoV-2. However, if you’re using Omicron variants, you should use Vero cells instead.\nDay 3 – Infect cells.\nPre-warm all reagents at 37°C in a water bath or incubator.\nDilute your virus stock to a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 in 5 mL of DMEM (without any supplements). A confluent T175 cm2 flask will have approx. 3 × 107 cells. Use this number and the equation below to calculate the amount of virus to be used:\n        (MOI) ∗ (number of cells) / virus stock concentration in PFU/mL.\nRemove media from flasks.\nWash cells twice with 1× PBS. Add the 5 mL of virus calculated as per step 5.b.\nSet up a “mock” infection in the 25 cm2 flask, where you add 2 mL of DMEM but NO virus stock.\nReturn the flasks to 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 h.\nEvery 10 min gently rock flasks to re-distribute the inoculum and prevent cells from drying out.",
    "After 1 h, remove the viral inoculum and wash cells once with 1× PBS.\nAdd 35 mL of DMEM + 2% FBS.\nIncubate at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 72 h, or until ∼90% cytopathic effect (CPE) is visible.\nNote: CPE for this virus can be described as fusion of neighboring cells into syncytia and cell death leading to the appearance of gaps in the cell monolayer. No CPE should be seen in your mock flask.\nHarvest the media from the flasks.\nCentrifuge at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C.\nTransfer the resulting supernatant into a new tube.\nAliquot and store at −80°C.\nPause point: Once viral aliquots have been placed in −80°C, they can be stored until you have the time to perform plaque assays.\nDay 4–9 Measure virus titer by plaque assay.\nDay 4 - two days before the plaque assay, set up 6 well plates of Vero E6 cells as per steps 1–3. Use a cell density that will ensure that plates are 100% confluent 48 h later. Seed cells at 5 × 104 cells/mL, using 2 mL of media per week for 6 well plates.\nDay 6 – Set up plaque assay.\nSet up 10-fold serial dilutions of your virus samples from step 4.d in DMEM (without any supplements).\nIn 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes, add 450 μL of DMEM and 50 μL of virus stock. Pipette up and down to mix. Discard the tip. Using a sterile tip, take 50 μL from the tube and place it into a new tube containing 450 μL of DMEM. Continue until a 10−7 dilution.",
    "Take 6 well plates out of the incubator. Wash once with 1× PBS. Add 400 μL of virus dilution per well. Return the plate to 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 h. Every 10 min gently rock plates to re-distribute the inoculum and prevent cells from drying out.\nWhile the plates are incubating, prepare your overlay. Mix a ratio of 1:1 of DMEM and 2.4% cellulose in a 50 mL centrifuge tube. Invert vigorously until a uniform suspension has formed. Place the tubes in a 37°C water bath to pre-warm. You will need 12 mL of overlay for each 6 well plate.\nRemove plates from the incubator and place them in the BSC. Take your overlay tubes from the water bath and place them in the BSC. Remove the inoculum from the 6 well plates. Invert the overlay tubes to ensure the suspension is until uniform. Pipette 2 mL per well of the overlay using a serological pipette. Incubate plates at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 3 days. Ensure plates are not moved during this time.\nNote: We do not perform wash steps after the inoculum is removed (step 6.a.iv). We based our protocol on similar protocols described for plaque assays of SARS-CoV-28[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8] and Influenza,9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] which also do not include a wash step before addition of the overlay.\nDay 9 – Fix and stain the plaque assay.\nNote: All the steps should be performed in a BSC, until you are ready to count plaques (step 6.c.v)\nRemove the plates from the incubator and place them in the BSC. Add 2 mL per well of 10% Neutral Buffered formalin (NBF) using a serological pipette. Gently swirl the plates until you can see the cellulose mixture lift up and the NBF is in full contact with the cells. Incubate at 20°C–23°C for 30 min.",
    "Remove the NBF mixture into a waste basin. Rinse the cells once-twice with water.\nAdd 1 mL of Crystal Violet stain (see materials) per well. Incubate at 20°C–23°C for 20 min.\nRemove the Crystal Violet stain. Rinse the cells twice with water. The volume of water does not need to be measured and is most easily done with a wash bottle. Tap excess water on a paper towel. Allow plates to dry in the hood for 15–30 min.\nRemove plates and count plaques.\nCalculate plaque forming units per mL using the following formula: PFU/mL = (number of plaques x 2.5) x (dilution factor).\nNote: The volume of water does not need to be measured and is most easily done with a wash bottle.\nCritical: Stocks MUST be grown without the presence of antibiotics, in order to prevent residual antibiotics from preventing S. aureus growth.\nGrow S. aureus\nTiming: 3 days\nThis step provides you with bacterial inoculum that can be used in co-infection assays. The inoculum must be freshly prepared on the day of the infection. The time for that has been included in the co-infection protocol (see below).\nPrepare the bacterial inoculum.\nDay 1 - Prepare single colony streak plates.\nStreak S. aureus bacteria from frozen glycerol stocks on 100 mm × 15 mm Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) plates. If you are using mutants or strains containing plasmids, include appropriate antibiotics in the agar. Incubate plates at 37°C for 16–18 h.\nDay 2 - Prepare 16–18 h cultures.\nTake a single colony of bacteria and inoculate into 5 mL of Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) in a 30 mL tube. If you are using mutants or strains containing plasmids, include appropriate antibiotics in the broth. Incubate at 37°C, 200 rpm for 16–18 h.",
    "Day 3 – Prepare bacterial inoculum for cell infection.\nTransfer 500 μL of bacteria into a 1.5 mL microfuge tube. Spin at 20,000 × g for 1 min.\nWash twice with 700 μL of DMEM. Spin at 20,000 × g for 1 min between washes.\nRe-suspend bacteria in 500 μL of DMEM.\nMeasure Optical Density (OD) at 600 nm.\nIn a separate tube, dilute your bacteria to a final OD600 of 0.33 in 500 μL of DMEM. Take a sample of this solution to confirm the correct number of bacteria are present.\nTo determine bacterial numbers, use a 96 well plate.\nTake 20 μL of the solution you want to quantify and place it in 180 μL of 1× PBS in well 1. Pipette up and down to mix. Discard the tip. Using a sterile tip, take 20 μL from well 1 and place it into a new well containing 180 μL of 1× PBS. Continue until a 10−7 dilution. Take 10 μL of each dilution and spot them on a 100 mm × 15 mm TSA plate. Repeat the plating step twice, so that you have two replicates plated for each dilution. Incubate plates at 37°C for 16–18 h. After incubation, select the dilution where 10–40 colonies are present and count the number of colonies. Take the average count from the two repeats you plated. Use this average value to calculate CFU/mL using the following formula:\nCFU/mL = (number of colonies) x (dilution factor)/volume plated (mL).\nUse 5 μL of the solution (OD600 of 0.33) from step 7.c.v in a well of a 12 well tissue culture plate. This should be the equivalent of 1 × 105 CFU/well.\nViral bacterial co-infection and pathogen quantification\nTiming: 10 days",
    "This step comprises the viral – bacterial co-infection assay. The outline of the experiments is summarized in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]. The assay relies on previously prepared cells, virus and bacteria. It allows for the quantification of viral and bacterial replication, and assessment of host RNA and/or protein, depending on your experimental needs. Different time points post infection can be used if desired.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2801-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Schematic of the steps during the 4 days of a SARS-CoV-2 – S. aureus co-infection assay\nThe figure demonstrates the main components of the assay – when and how to set up host cells, bacterial cultures and virus infection. Image created using Biorender.\nDay 1 - Plate host cells in 12 well plates as per steps 1–3, and streak bacteria strains.\nFor 12 well plates, cells are routinely seeded at 5 × 104 cells/mL, which results in confluent wells in 48 h. Use 1 mL of media per well for 12 well plates.\nStreak bacteria strains as per step 7a.\nDay 2 - Prepare 16–18 h bacterial cultures as per step 7.b.\nDay 3 – Infect cells with SARS-CoV-2 and S. aureus.\nNote: All work from this step onwards should be performed in a CL3 laboratory.\nPrepare your bacterial inoculum as per step 7c. From this step forward, work should continue in a CL3 laboratory.\nPrepare viral inoculum. For a confluent 12 well plate, assume a cell population of 1 × 105 cells per well. Dilute virus stocks for a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in a volume of 100 μL per well of DMEM (see step 5.b for the formula for MOI calculations).",
    "Remove media from 12 well plates. Wash them twice with 1× PBS at approx. 1 mL per well. Remove PBS and add 100 μL of the virus inoculum prepared in step 10.b per well. Ensure you have a “mock” well, where only 100 μL of DMEM, but no virus, are added. Return the plate to 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 h. Every 10 min gently rock plates to re-distribute the inoculum and prevent cells from drying out.\nRemove plates from the incubator. Take the viral inoculum off. Wash wells twice with 1× PBS. Add 1 mL of DMEM to each well.\nTo desired wells, add 5 μL of bacterial inoculum, as prepared in step 7.c. For each infection, you should have control samples of mock, including virus alone and bacteria alone. If you are testing more than one bacterial strain and/or mutant, ensure you have bacteria only wells for each strain, in order to facilitate bacterial counts.\nIncubate plates at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 24 h.\nDay 4 – Harvest infections for bacteria and virus quantification.\nRetrieve the plates from the incubator. Harvest the culture media into 1.5 mL microfuge tubes. Spin at 15,000 × g for 1 min.\nWhile samples are spinning, add 500 μL of 1× PBS + 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 to all wells.\nOnce centrifugation is complete, take the microfuge tubes back into the hood. Using a 1 mL syringe, gently take the supernatant from the microfuge tube, without disturbing the bacterial pellet. Attach the syringe to a 13 mm, 0.22 μm filter. Filter the supernatant into a new 1.5 mL microfuge tube. These supernatants can now be used for the quantification of virus. They can be measured immediately or stored at −80°C until needed.",
    "Harvest the cell lysates in the 1× PBS + 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 from the wells in step 11.b and add it to the remaining pellets from step 11.c. Pipette up and down a few times to re-suspend the pellet. Perform a serial dilution of this sample (cell lysate and bacterial pellet) and plate on TSA plates for CFU enumeration, as described in step 7.c.v. Incubate plates at 37°C for 18 h.\nPause point: Once viral samples have been placed in −80°C, they can be stored until you have the time to perform plaque assays or other measurement techniques.\nNote: If you encounter difficulties with bacterial growth, refer to common problems and solutions in the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section.\nOptional: Day 4 – Harvest cellular RNA or protein. The protocol allows users to perform host RNA or protein isolation if desired. For this, steps 8–10 are performed as above. Following the incubation described in step 10f, retrieve the plates and place them in a BSC. Follow the steps below for RNA or protein isolation. All work in this step should be performed in a CL3 laboratory and in a BSC.\nNote: If users wish, they can still perform a plaque assay and quantify the amount of virus from samples that will later be used for RNA or protein purification. If you wish to determine PFU/mL in parallel to RNA/protein, perform steps 11a and 11c with the supernatant, and then proceed to use the cells as described below. Please note it is NOT possible to measure bacterial CFU for RNA/protein samples.\nHost RNA isolation.",
    "Infect cells as outlined in steps 8–1o. Following the desired incubation time, remove culture supernatant and wash cells three times with 1× PBS. Add 500 μL of Cell Protect reagent (Qiagen) to each well and incubate at RT for 5 min. Harvest the wells and centrifuge at 1,200 × g for 5 min. Remove the supernatant and store the pellets at −80°C.\nLyse cell pellets with 500 μL of 1× PBS + 0.1% (v/v) Triton - X100 (see Note below). Proceed with the RNA extraction using the QIAGEN RNEasy kit, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Manufacturer’s instructions can be found here: https://www.qiagen.com/ca/resources/resourcedetail?id=14e7cf6e-521a-4cf7-8cbc-bf9f6fa33e24&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/ca/resources/resourcedetail?id=14e7cf6e-521a-4cf7-8cbc-bf9f6fa33e24&lang=en] . For ease of use, we have also included a brief summary of the RNA extraction protocol here (spin version).\nAdd 600 μL of buffer RLT to the re-suspended cell pellets from the previous step. Pipette to mix.\nAdd 1 volume (1.1 mL) of 70% ethanol to the cell lysate and mix well by pipetting.\nTransfer 700 μL of the sample from step iv to an RNeasy spin column and centrifuge for 1 min at 10 000 x g. Discard the flow through.\nRepeat step v until you have passed all the lysate through the column.\nAdd 700 μL of buffer RW1 to the column. Centrifuge for 1 min at 10 000 × g. Discard the flow through.\nAdd 500 μL of buffer RPE to the column. Centrifuge for 2 min at 10 000 × g. Discard the flow through.\nCentrifuge for 2 min at 10 000 × g. Discard the flow through.\nPlace the RNeasy column into a new 1.5 mL collection tube. Add 40 μL of water to the membrane. Incubate for 1 min at RT. Centrifuge for 1 min at 10 000 × g.\nRepeat step x. for a second elution (use the same tube).",
    "You may now remove these samples from CL3 and process the protein as desired. Please follow appropriate decontamination protocols for removing samples from a CL3 laboratory, as per your local SOPs.\nStore RNA samples at −80°C\nNote: We had previously optimized this step for the isolation of RNA from cells infected with bacteria. We determined that the use of 500 μL of PBS + 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 (step a.ii above) improved yield if performed before the addition of RLT buffer and have since included it in all of our RNA isolation protocols. If users desire, they can skip this re-suspension step and proceed directly to the addition of the RLT buffer (step a.iii above).\nHost protein isolation.∗∗\nInfect cells as outlined in steps 8–10 . Following the desired incubation time, remove culture supernatant and wash cells three times with 1× PBS. Add 50 μL of RIPA buffer with protease inhibitor to each well. Incubate samples on a rocker at 4°C for 30 min.\nCentrifuge samples at 12,000 × g for 20 min. Harvest the resulting supernatant and place it in a new tube. You may now remove these samples from CL3 and process the protein, as desired. Please follow appropriate decontamination protocols for removing samples from a CL3 laboratory, as per your local SOPs.\nDay 5 – Count bacteria.\nRemove plates from step 11.e from the incubator. Count colonies and calculate CFU per mL.\n      CFU/mL = (number of colonies) × (dilution factor)/volume plated (mL).\nBacterial replication occurs during the 24 h incubation period. Routinely, we observed at least a 3-log increase in bacterial numbers between 0 h and 24 h. For representative results, please see Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2801-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. S. aureus replication occurs over the 24 h of co-infection",
    "Vero E6 cells were mock infected or infected with CoV-2 at MOI of 1 for 1 h and overlayed with 1 mL of serum free DMEM. 1 × 105 CFU of WT S. aureus strain USA300 were added to the culture media. 24 h later, DMEM was harvested, samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 15000 × g. 500 μL PBS + 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 were added to the tissue culture wells. Following centrifugation, supernatant was removed, and the pellet resuspended in the 500 μL PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100 from the wells. Bacteria were serially diluted and plated on TSA plates. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 18 h and CFU enumerated. Data shown are mean ± SEM of 3-5 independent experiments.

Note that this protocol is for measurement of infectious virus by plaque assay. Other forms of measurement, including TCID 50, qRT-PCR or other methods of your choice can be used instead.\nThe plaque assay protocol is detailed in step 6.\nWe routinely observed higher viral replication levels in the presence of S. aureus with this protocol. For representative results of the difference between mono- and co-infected cultures, see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2801-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

We have found that 6 wells of a 12 well plate provide sufficient protein for western blot analysis.\nCritical: When performing the assay, you MUST filter the virus only samples the same as co-infected samples. The filtration of the sample results in a decrease of PFU/mL of approx. 1-log. Therefore, for accurate comparisons to be possible, all samples need to be filtered."
