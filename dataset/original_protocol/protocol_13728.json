  "title": "SECONDs Administration Guidelines: A Fast Tool to Assess Consciousness in Brain-injured Patients",
  "procedures": [
    "The following protocol and its validation study have been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University and University Hospital of Liège (reference 2017-297) and comply with the institution's guidelines on human research. All subjects (or their legal surrogates) who contributed to the elaboration and validation of the scale gave their written informed consent to participate. All personal data were processed according to the General Data Protection Regulation.\nThis scale has been developed with the aim to provide a comprehensive diagnostic assessment tool that would allow the examination of a large spectrum of patients with varying levels of consciousness. Like the CRS-R on which it is based, the SECONDs does not require specific inclusion or exclusion criteria to be administered. However, it has been validated in a population of patients with prolonged DoC, with predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Representative Results).\n1. The Simplified Evaluation of CONsciousness Disorders (SECONDs)\nBefore starting the behavioral examination, adjust the lighting of the room to be adequate to perform the exam and ensure the patient is comfortably positioned with the four limbs exposed and the head oriented as straight as possible.\nTurn off any TV, radio, or other potentially distracting stimuli.\nNote any recent changes in medication in the patient's current treatment regimen, with particular attention to sedative and psychoactive drugs.\nSelect a mirror of a minimum recommended 10 cm x 10 cm size for a square-shaped mirror or a 10 cm in diameter for a round-shaped one.",
    "NOTE: Items should be administered sequentially from A to H: observation, command-following (score 6), communication (conditional, scores 7 and 8), visual pursuit (score 4), visual fixation (score 3), localization to pain (conditional, score 2), oriented behaviors (score 5) and arousal (scores 1 and 0). This sequence does not follow the scores of the items ordinally. This order was designed to optimize the allocation of the patient's attentional capacities and reduce administration duration. Communication and localization to pain are conditional items and must be administered only under certain conditions (see corresponding sections). The final score corresponds to the score of the highest succeeded item and directly reflects the diagnosis. An additional index score can be calculated to obtain a more accurate measure of the observed behaviors and allows following the evolution of the patient over time (see corresponding section).\n2. Observation (A)\nStimulation: at any time during the assessment, if no sustained eye-opening is observed or if the patients stops following commands for at least one minute, administer auditory (i.e., use patient's own name, clapping hands), tactile (i.e., CRS-R arousal facilitation protocol16), or noxious stimulation (i.e., pressure on fingernail bed) to arouse the patient.\nObserve the patient for one minute and report spontaneous behaviors.\n\t​NOTE: Pay attention to vocalizations, spontaneous movements of the four limbs, head, lips, or eyes, as well as spontaneous interactions with the environment.\nDuring the entire assessment, promote eye-opening before testing each item if needed. Observe the patient and report the presence of eye-opening, either spontaneously or in response to stimulation, as well as the presence of self-oriented behaviors or behaviors oriented toward the environment. See sections 8 and 9 for detailed scoring guidelines of oriented behaviors and arousal.",
    "NOTE: If eye-opening is not possible, oculomotor command-following, visual pursuit, and visual fixation (see sections 3, 5, 6) should be assessed by opening the patient's eyes manually. See section 9 (arousal) for detailed scoring criteria for eye-opening.\n3. Command-following (B)\nSelect three simple movements that were not observed as spontaneously repetitive during the observation period. Appropriate examples include: 'Move your hand', 'Turn your head', 'Blink twice', 'Look at [object or person]', 'Look up/down', 'Open/close your mouth', 'Stick out your tongue', 'Say a word/make a sound'. Adapt the selection of commands to the physical abilities of the patient. In cases of suspected LIS, relate at least one command to eye movements.\nTest each command in three trials, with a 10-second interval between trials. A command may be repeated once within the same trial to increase the patient's motivation. If the first two commands are successfully performed (3/3 trials for both commands with accurate responses), the third command does not have to be administered.\nIn cases of known or suspected deafness, administer written commands. If the patient does not react to any of the oral commands, test at least one written command.\nScore \"6\" for command-following if the patient accurately responds to 2/3 trials for at least one command. To be scored, the response has to be clear and must appear within 10 seconds following the command prompt (and not spontaneously). All unclear, ambiguous responses or reflexive movements due to spasms or grasping must not be scored. Report the commands used on the scoring sheet, as well as the number of successful trials.\n4. Communication (conditional) (C)",
    "NOTE: Perform a communication test if at least two distinct responses to command are successfully performed (i.e., at least 2/3 for two commands) or if the patient can express a \"yes\" and a \"no\", either verbally, through gestures, eye movements or writing, spontaneously or not.\nIf no verbal response can be produced, base the communication code on previously identified motor responses. Clearly explain the code to the patient before starting (e.g., thumbs-up for a \"yes\" and thumbs-down for a \"no\") and employ the most frequently used code for this patient, if any. The examiner can remind the code to be used to the patient before each question.\n\tNOTE: It is necessary to use two distinct responses; the absence of movement cannot be used for a \"yes\" or a \"no\".\nFirst ask 5 binary autobiographical questions - (1) 'Is your name [incorrect name]?' (2) 'Are you born in [correct birth year]?' (3) 'Is your name [correct name]?' (4) 'Are you born in [incorrect birth year]?' (5) 'Do you have children?'\nIf the patient fails to correctly answer the autobiographical questions, ask the following binary situational questions: (1) 'Are we in [place: hospital, home or else]?' (2) 'Am I wearing a hat?' (3) 'Are we at the swimming pool?' (4) 'Am I touching your hand?' (Touch) (5) 'Am I touching your face?' (Do not touch).\nScore \"7\" for intentional communication if the patient responds to at least three out of five questions from one question set, regardless of accuracy. Score \"8\" for functional communication if the patient correctly responds to the five questions from one question set (either autobiographical or situational). Report the nature of the \"yes/no\" code, the modality (verbal, written) and the type (autobiographical, situational) of the questions used, the number of responses and the number of correct ones.",
    "NOTE: Question sets must be considered separately, and correct answers from distinct question sets cannot be added up when scoring the item.\n5. Visual pursuit (D)\nTo assign a visual pursuit score, move silently around the bed while observing whether the patient's gaze spontaneously and clearly follows this movement during at least two seconds in two different directions.\nIf a clear pursuit is not spontaneously observed, position the mirror about 30 cm in front of the patient's face.\nAfter confirming that the patient can see their reflection, move the mirror slowly from left to right (or right to left, depending on the initial position of the patient's eyes), right to the left, top to bottom, and bottom to top for at least four seconds per movement.\nScore a \"4\" for visual pursuit if an uninterrupted visual pursuit is observed in two different directions for at least two seconds. Report the number of observed pursuits on each axis, the type of stimulus used (spontaneous, mirror), and whether manual eye-opening was employed.\n6. Visual fixation (E)\nTo score visual fixation, enter the patient's field of view and observe whether the patient's gaze spontaneously fixates on the examiner for at least two seconds in two different visual quadrants by turning toward the examiner (performing a saccadic eye movement).\nIf no clear and spontaneous visual fixations are observed, present the mirror about 30 cm away from the patient's face in all four quadrants of the patient's visual field, but not in the axis of their gaze, for at least four seconds per quadrant.",
    "Score a \"3\" for visual fixation if two fixations are observed, either spontaneously or induced by the mirror. A clear change of gaze orientation toward the mirror (or examiner) followed by a fixation of at least two seconds should be observed. Report the quadrants in which the patient showed the fixations, as well as the type of the stimulus used (spontaneous, mirror), and whether manual eye-opening was employed.\n7. Localization to pain (conditional) (F)\nNOTE: Test localization to pain only if the patient did not demonstrate command-following (score of 5 or below)\nPlace a pen or pencil on the patient's fingernail bed for five seconds before instructing the patient to 'Remove your hand to avoid the pain'.\nIf the patient does not remove the hand within the next five seconds, administer pressure on the nail bed with the pen or pencil for five seconds. One trial should be performed on each hand. If the patient removed the hand after the warning, do not apply pressure and directly proceed to the other hand and repeat the warning.\nScore \"2\" for localization to pain if, during at least one of the two trials, the non-stimulated hand of the patient clearly touches the stimulated hand. If the patient clearly removes the pain-stimulated hand after the warning but before the stimulation on both trials (anticipation response), score \"6\" for command-following. Report the side (L or R) of each observed localization and anticipation response (always report stimulated side).\n8. Oriented behaviors (G)",
    "To assess oriented behaviors, perform continuous observation as described in 2.3. and score oriented behaviors by considering all of the behaviors observed during the entire examination. These behaviors may include (but are not limited to) scratching themselves, grabbing the bed sheets, holding the bed, pulling on the clothes/tracheostomy/gastrostomy/catheter, placing the hand on the mouth to cough, smiling/laughing/crying contextually, stereotyped verbal response or gesture when spoken to (e.g., grunt, head nod or thumbs up), or any other automatic non-reflexive behaviors.\n\tNOTE: Yawning should not be scored as an automatic non-reflexive behavior.\nScore \"5\" for oriented behaviors if the patient presents at least one clearly observed oriented behavior. Report the type and the number of times each behavior is observed.\n9. Arousal (H)\nTo assess arousal, perform continuous observation as described in 2.3. and score \"0\" for no arousal if, during the entire evaluation, the patient never opened the eyes, with or without stimulation (including nociceptive stimulation). Score \"1\" for arousal if the patient opened the eyes at least once during the assessment, either spontaneously or following stimulation. Report the approximate percentage of time the eyes were open throughout the examination (0-25%; 25-50%; 50-75%; 75-100%).\nSpecify if the eye-opening happened spontaneously or following a noxious, tactile, or auditory stimulation, as well as the number of stimulations of each type that were administered.\n10. Additional index\nNOTE: An additional index score has been developed to give a more accurate account of the behaviors observed during the assessment, allowing monitoring of a patient's level of consciousness over time. For each successful item, specific index points correspond to the type of behavior observed (see Table 1).",
    "Calculate the additional index score by adding up the points earned in each item tested during the assessment. This measure ranging from 0 to 100 is independent from the final score and diagnosis but is designed to more precisely follow the evolution of a patient who may exhibit subtle clinical changes without modification of the diagnosis across repeated assessments.\ntable:\n﻿0,1,2,3,4\nDiagnosis,Score,Item,Sub-item,Additional index points\nEMCS,8,Communication*,5 answers (accurate),29\nMCS+,7,Communication*,3 or 4 answers (accurate),21\nMCS+,7,Communication*,5 answers (inaccurate OK),14\nMCS+,7,Communication*,3 or 4 answers (inaccurate OK),7\nMCS+,6,Command-following,2 commands 3/3,24\nMCS+,6,Command-following,2 commands 2/3,18\nMCS+,6,Command-following,1 command 3/3,12\nMCS+,6,Command-following,1 command 2/3,6\nMCS-,5,Oriented behaviors,More than two different movements,15\nMCS-,5,Oriented behaviors,Two different movements,10\nMCS-,5,Oriented behaviors,One movement,5\nMCS-,4,Visual pursuit,On four (all) occasions,16\nMCS-,4,Visual pursuit,On three occasions,12\nMCS-,4,Visual pursuit,On two occasions,8\nMCS-,3,Visual fixation,On four (all) occasions,12\nMCS-,3,Visual fixation,On three occasions,9\nMCS-,3,Visual fixation,On two occasions,6\nMCS-,2,Pain localization*,On both hands,4\nMCS-,2,Pain localization*,On one hand,2\nUWS,1,Arousal,Spontaneously,4\nUWS,1,Arousal,To auditory stimulation,3\nUWS,1,Arousal,To tactile stimulation,2\nUWS,1,Arousal,To pain,1\nComa,0,Arousal,,0\nTable 1.
