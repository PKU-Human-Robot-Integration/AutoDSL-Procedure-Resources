    "Isolation and culture of CD4+ T cellsPrepare peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors, as previously described (Kummerow et al., 2014). Briefly, for separation of mononuclear cells from human blood, we used lymphocyte isolation medium, according to the manufacturer's instructions, and carry out the density gradient centrifugation at 450 g (acceleration: 1, deceleration: 0) and room temperature (RT) for 30 min. PBMCs were collected, and remaining erythrocytes were lysed with 1–3 mL of erythrocyte lysis buffer (see Recipes) for 1–2 min. Estimated duration: 1.5 h.Negatively isolate human CD4+ T cells from PBMCs, using the AutoMACS Pro Separator with the CD4+ T cell Isolation Kit human, according to manufacturer’s protocols. Estimated duration: 1 h.Resuspend isolated CD4+ T cells at a density of 3 × 106/mL, in a 24-well plate with AIM V medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (1 mL/well), and keep the plate at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 24 h.Prior to AFM experiments, measure the cell density with an automated cell counter, remove the media by centrifugation (1,200 rpm at RT for 5 min) and adjust the cell suspension to a density of 2 × 105–3 × 105/mL, by resuspending the cells in AIM V medium without FBS.Preparation of antibody-functionalized coverslips (see Video 1)Clean glass coverslips, by wiping with 70% ethanol.With a permanent marker, mark a center spot with a diameter of approximately 7 mm at the backside of the glass coverslip.Coat the center spot with 40 µL of Polyornithine solution (optimized concentration for T cells: 100 µg/mL, in sterilized ddH2O) at RT for 30 min.Remove the polyornithine solution with a diaphragm laboratory pump and leave the coverslip to air dry for 10 min.Apply 20 µL of antibody dilution (in PBS) and incubate at 37°C for 30 min, to functionalize a spot of the glass coverslip.",
    "Store at 4°C overnight. In our experiments, the following combination of antibody concentrations showed the best results for IS formation (optimal concentrations might differ if other factors are investigated):αLFA-1 (9 µg/mL)αCD-3 (30 µg/mL)αCD28 (90 µg/mL)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Sample preparation. Preparation of PDMS, and antibody functionalization of PDMS surfacesSlowly pass all materials (e.g., Petri dishes, spatulas) through the arch of an electrostatic deionizer (~2 s), to remove any static charges before bringing them into contact with Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer components A (methylhydrosiloxane-dimethylsolioxane) and B (vinyl-terminated polymethylsiloxane).Mix component A and B in a 10:1 ratio in polypropylene tubes, to create PDMS with a stiffness of approximately 2.5 MPa (adapt according to the manufactures’ protocol, if other stiffnesses are addressed)Note: When handling the individual PDMS components, strictly use polypropylene materials (e.g., VWR Graduated Polypropylene Beaker 100 mL, catalog number 213-3918; Sarstedt Stirring Rod 120 mm, PP, catalog number 81.970), and Kimtech G3 Sterling Nitrile gloves (e.g., VWR catalog number 112-4879). Pour the mixture into 50-mm flat bottom Petri dishes (e.g., Fluordish), and make sure to cover the surface with a layer of approximately 1.5 mm. Leave to settle for 1 h.Place in an incubator to cure at 60°C for 16 h.Prior to AFM measurements, cut 10 × 10 mm squares from the PDMS layer with a scalpel blade, turn the PDMS piece over, and continue with the bottom side.Continue the functionalization process like described for glass cover slips (B), and apply cells as described below (D).Application of T cells on antibody functionalized surfaces (see Video 1)Pipette 100 µL of CD4+ T cell suspension in AIM V medium (without FBS) into the marked center spot of the functionalized surface (Figure 1A, approximately 2 × 104–3 × 104 will be transferred).",
    "Allow the cells to settle and interact with the functionalized surface in a wet chamber at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 15 min (plastic Petri dish lined with wet paper tissue; Figures 1A–1B), to avoid drying.Mount the functionalized glass cover slip onto a glass slide. Pipette 2 µL of sterilized ddH2O between the glass layers, to make sure that the functionalized cover slip or PDMS piece is held by cohesion, and will not move during the measurements (Figures 1C–1D).The sample should be used immediately. Discard the sample and freshly prepare a new one after 60 min of measurements, since the cells will die and start detaching from the surface at RT and without increased partial CO2 pressure.AFM preparation and calibrationNote: In our experiments, the NanoScope 9.1 software was used to operate a BioScope Catalyst system (Bruker, Santa Barbara, USA) mounted onto a Leica DMI 4000 B optical microscope. All methods are specifically described for these systems, but the procedures can be adapted for other software versions and AFM systems, allowing peak force tapping techniques. Insert the MLCT cantilever into the Bruker Fluid Cantilever Holder, using tweezers and a preparation plate (Figure 1E).Make sure to slide the Cantilever back, until it takes up the entire space of the white base plate, and is properly held by the clamp (Figure 1F).Attach the Fluid Cantilever Holder to the BioScope Catalyst Scan Head, and adjust the laser spot to Cantilever B (rectangular), using the BioScope Catalyst EasyAlign table.Attention:  Soft cantilevers are prone to strong thermal drift. Allow the cantilever to equilibrate, which can take up to 10 min. Do not continue until the laser spot has come to rest.In NanoScope software version 9.1, choose PeakForce QNM in Fluid (Standard Amplitude), from the Mechanical Properties Experimental Group.",
    "Determine the cantilevers spring constant, using the thermal tune technique, integrated in the NanoScope 9.1 software (Ohler, 2007).Bring the BioScope Catalyst Scan Head to a vertical position on the BioScope Catalyst EasyAlign table.Pipette a drop of approximately 30 µL of AIM V medium (without FBS) onto the cantilever holder. Make sure that the cantilever is fully submerged in the fluid, but is not damaged by the pipette tip during application of the medium.Bring the BioScope Catalyst Scan Head to a horizontal position, and allow the cantilever to equilibrate, which can take another 10–15 min. Then, readjust the laser spot.Mount an ethanol-cleaned glass slide on the measurement stage, and pipette a 50 µL drop of AIM V medium (without FBS) onto the center of the glass slide.Transfer the BioScope Catalyst Scan Head to the measurement stage, and engage the cantilever to the functionalized surface (a manual pre-approach can be done, until the drop of media on the cantilever holder and the media on the glass slide merge).Calculate the Deflection Sensitivity in V/nm, using the Update Sensitivity tool, which is integrated in the NanoScope 9.1 software.The system is calibrated and ready to measure.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4383/bioprotoc-12-08-4383-g001.jpgFigure 1.

    "Equipment used to insert a cantilever into the cantilever holder (I: tweezers, II: cantilever holder, III: preparation plate, VI: box of cantilevers). F. Detailed view of cantilever holder mounted onto the preparation plate, with adequately inserted cantilever.AFM based elasticity mappingMove the prepared sample (T cells attached to functionalized surfaces) to the measurement stage, and lock it in position with the magnetic Teflon clip.Mount the calibrated BioScope Catalyst Scan Head onto the measurement stage, and engage.Use an empty spot on the functionalized surface between the cells to set all parameters for elasticity mapping. In our experiments, deactivating the ScanAsyst Auto Control, and using the following parameters, showed the best results (if not mentioned here, the NanoScope default value was kept, or automatically set by the system):Starting scan size: 10 µmLine scan rate: 0.25 HzLines: 256Feedback gain factor: 0.5Peak Force Setpoint: 700 pNPeak Force Amplitude: 100 nmSeveral attempts are expected to establish contact between cantilever and surface. If this is difficult to achieve, increase the systems Engage Gain from factor 0.5 to factor 1.5, then withdraw and re-engage.While scanning, use the optical microscope (20× objective, leading to a 200-fold total magnification) to locate a T cell in close proximity, and approach it by shifting the cantilevers’ X-Y offsets, until approximately a quarter of the cell is covered by the cantilever movement (Figure 2A; see also Notes, for information regarding scanning whole cells).Attention:  The manufacturer gives a relatively wide range of possible tip heights for MLCT cantilevers (2.5–8 µm). Therefore, collisions between the T cell and the front cantilever edges, leading to measurement artifacts, cannot be excluded. In our experiments, mostly the lower right or lower left cell quarter was approached, to make use of the cantilever tilt.",
    "However, some cells still turned out to be too large to scan, and some cantilevers turned out to have a tip too short to be used for this application (see also Notes 1, 2, Figure 2E).Use the NanoScope 9.1 “Capture next” or “Capture now” tools to save the data map (Figure 2B, C).If the cantilever is withdrawn from the surface before navigating to the next cell, make sure to set the cantilevers’ X-Y offsets to 0 again, to allow a maximum degree of navigational space within the X-Y movement range of 100 µm for the scan heads.For a detailed introduction of PeakForce QNM data acquisition, we recommend the manufacturer’s video tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I1Hl1gl3Uk[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3I1Hl1gl3Uk]."
