    "General considerations Before starting hybridoma modification, knowledge on the host species and antibody isotype is required. We have used cut sites to knock in inserts upstream or downstream of CH1 heavy chain (HC), upstream of the hinge, and downstream of Cκ light chain (LC), but virtually any other cut site can be used to tailor the antibody to the intended use.It takes 4–6 weeks from the transfection of the target cell lines to the isolation of high levels of modified antibodies (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4613/bioprotoc-13-04-4613-g001.jpgFigure 1. Workflow overview. Hybridoma are transfected on day 0 with a plasmid encoding the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) and guide ribonucleic acid (gRNA), and a plasmid encoding a homology-directed repair (HDR) template containing an antibiotic resistance gene. At day 3, selection pressure is applied, and cells start to grow out. Resistant clones are expanded until reaching confluency, and single-cell clones (SCC) are prepared in 96-well plates. By day 30, positive clones are screened for production of the modified antibody and expanded for production.For the purpose of this protocol and to illustrate the diversity of potential applications, we describe the full characterization of three successfully edited hybridoma: isotype switching of the constant heavy chain (HC) of rat IgG2a (r2a) Ig to a mouse IgG2a (m2a) constant HC and produce a chimeric r2a(V):m2a(C) mAb, introduction of an antigen in the hinge region of r2a HC to produce a Fab’ fragment–antigen fusion, and modification of the mouse IgG1 (m1) HC and mouse kappa (mκ) LC to introduce two site-specific labeling tags.Design of CRISPR/HDR template and gRNA For designing an HDR template and gRNA from scratch, the Addgene CRISPR guide[href=https://www.addgene.org/crispr/guide/] or the CRISPR 101 book[href=https://info.addgene.org/download-addgenes-ebook-crispr-101-3rd-edition] are good starting points.",
    "In Figures 2–6, the process for designing a CRISPR/HDR template and gRNAs is illustrated step by step. We take the example of targeting the C-terminus of m1 CH1 to engineer a mAb-secreting cell line to produce Fab’ fragments bearing a site-specific labeling site at the C-terminus of the CH1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4613/bioprotoc-13-04-4613-g002.jpgFigure 2. Annotating the target sequence. A. Access the genomic sequence of the locus of interest (e.g., on NCBI Gene). Using “sequence text” view, visualize exons and introns in the target locus. B. Remove annotations to visualize only the nucleotide sequence. For a given locus, exons are marked in red and introns in green. Here are highlighted constant heavy chain (CH)1, hinge, CH2, and CH3 in the Ighg1 gene (mIgG1 constant region). C. Copy the sequence in Snapgene and annotate exons to identify the target region. This typically depends on the intended modification. Here, we target the C-terminus of CH1 of mIgG1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4613/bioprotoc-13-04-4613-g003.jpgFigure 3. Identification of the target locus. A. Identify the region to target for the knock in. Here, we selected the C-terminus of the CH1 domain to insert part of the hinge region, a short linker, a site-specific labeling site, and a polyhistidine tag. This effectively transforms a mAb into a Fab’ fragment bearing a site-specific labelling site at the C-terminus of its heavy chain (HC). B. Copy the selected sequence to CRISPOR. C. Choose the appropriate host (here, Mus musculus) and protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) (typically, -NGG) and submit.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4613/bioprotoc-13-04-4613-g004.jpgFigure 4. Selection of gRNAs. A. Protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequences and corresponding gRNA candidates are identified by CRISPOR. All possible PAM sequences (-NGG here) are identified below the input sequence. B. Sequences and characteristics of potential gRNAs are displayed as a table, ordered by predicted efficacy.",
    "The insertion site should be less than 10 bp away from the double strand break if possible. When targeting a new region, select at least two or three gRNAs based on their proximity to the intended site of insertion and precited score. Here, we selected gRNA_m1_HC (5′-CTTGGTGCTGCTGGCCGGGT-3′). By clicking on “cloning,” a new window opens with sequences for cloning into a variety of Cas9-containing vectors. C. We used a U6 expression system (U6 promoter, pX330 vectors, and derivatives) (Cong et al., 2013). Here, we used a 20 nt gRNA, but it was recently proposed to use a 19 nt gRNA for improved efficiency (Kim et al., 2020). Select the appropriate primers and follow the instructions to clone the gRNAs into the pX330 vector at the BbsI site.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4613/bioprotoc-13-04-4613-g005.jpgFigure 5. nserting the desired sequence at the knock-in site. A. Copy the gRNA sequence(s) into Snapgene and B. visualize the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence(s). Insert the sequence to knock in as close as possible to the PAM sequence. C. Insert the predetermined nucleotides containing the desired insert. Here, we inserted part of the hinge region (VPRDC) allowing association with the light chain (LC) downstream of CH1, followed by a multiple cloning site (MCS), a flexible linker (GGGGS), a sortag motif (LAETGG), and a polyhistidine tag (HHHHHH), followed by a stop codon. The insert is followed by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) to allow for transcription of blasticidin resistance gene (BSD) and a simian vacuolating virus 40 (SV40) poly A tail to dissociate ribosomes. Each domain is surrounded by a MCS to allow easy exchange of any part of the plasmid. Here, we additionally optimized part of the CH1 to improve association with the LC (PACSTKVDKKI, S>C mutation).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4613/bioprotoc-13-04-4613-g006.jpgFigure 6. Homology arms (HA) and final HDR template design. The HAs span ca. 0.",
    "6 kb on each side of the insert. Their large size allows a few mismatches between the HAs and the target locus without affecting HA annealing to the genomic locus during HDR. Therefore, small adjustments can be done in the HA sequence compared to the germline sequence initially obtained from the genome browser without affecting HDR efficacy. A. It is necessary to mutate the “NGG” protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence(s). To inactivate the PAM sequences, mutate “NGG” to “NGC,” “NGA,” or “NGT.” If the PAM sequence is located within the coding region, ensure that it is a silent mutation. Alternatively, remove the PAM sequences all together. Cells having undergone successful HDR will not contain PAM sequence(s) and the Cas9 will be inactivated. B. To define 5’HA and 3’HA, select ~0.6 kb on each side of the insert.Sequences of the constant immunoglobulin loci can be accessed on NCBI Gene[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/]; protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM) sequences and gRNA can be determined using CRISPOR[href=http://crispor.tefor.net/] or alternative tools[href=https://www.takarabio.com/learning-centers/gene-function/gene-editing/gene-editing-tools-and-information/sgrna-design-tools].The HDR template should contain 5′ and 3′ homology arms (HAs) flanking the desired insert, a stop codon, an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES), an antibiotic resistance gene (blasticidin or puromycin), and a poly A tail (Figure 8A–C). Inserts are typically 1–2 kb in length. While longer inserts are possible, HDR efficacy greatly decreases beyond 2–3 kb. The length of HAs depends on the length of the insert (~0.5 kb HAs per 1 kb insert), and typically ranges between 0.3 kb and 1 kb, although shorter HAs are possible. Here, we used 0.6 kb HAs.Recommended: Sequence the target region to ensure that no derivation from the germline is present and ensure that PAM sequences and splice acceptor sequences in downstream exons are removed from HAs in the HDR template.",

Determine gRNA efficacy for the region of interest through a T7 assay[href=https://international.neb.com/protocols/2014/08/11/determining-genome-targeting-efficiency-using-t7-endonuclease-i].The HDR template is ordered as double-stranded DNA gBlock and cloned in a pSmart vector (e.g., pSMART-HCKan, CloneSmart Blunt Cloning kit). Candidate gRNAs are ordered as single-stranded DNA oligos that are annealed and cloned in vectors from the pX330 family (Cong et al., 2013). A basic cloning protocol is available in Supplementary file[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20220919/Supplementary%20file.docx].After design and cloning, perform midipreps of the plasmid DNA encoding the HDR and gRNA templates using the NucleoBond Xtra Midi Plus EF kit and sequence using standard primers. The A260:A280 ratio should be at least 1.8.We have developed plasmids enabling modification of the HC of rat IgG2a hybridoma to replace the complete constant region by a new isotype, cleave in the hinge and insert any tag of interest (Fab’ fragment) (van der Schoot et al., 2019), and to modify mIgG1 CH1 (depicted in Figures 2–6 and recorded in the video) and Cκ kappa LC of murine hybridoma (Le Gall et al., 2021).

    "Culture of hybridoma cells and titration of antibiotic ahead of transfection Selection of cells that have successfully undergone HDR recombination is performed under antibiotic pressure. Ensuring quality of the parental cell line ahead of the procedure is critical (see Notes). The target hybridoma should be tested for antibiotic (blasticidin/puromycin) sensitivity prior to starting the experiment.Culture target hybridoma cells, either generated in house or obtained from the American Type Culture Collection, in complete culture media. Make sure to maintain cells at a high viability (> 90%).When confluent, seed 1 × 106 cells per well in a 6-well plate in 3 mL of culture medium and supplement with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 10, or 20 μg/mL of the appropriate antibiotic.Incubate cells at 37 °C for 3–7 days depending on the selected antibiotic (three days for puromycin, seven days for blasticidin).Determine the lowest concentration at which no viable cells remain in the culture by using Trypan blue and use the determined concentration to perform the selection procedure (Figure 7A–B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4613/bioprotoc-13-04-4613-g007.jpgFigure 7. Antibiotic titration, transfection, and expansion of resistant cells. A. Titration of puromycin on wild-type (WT) anti-human CD20 [NKI.B20/1]. Serial dilution of 0–12.5 μg/mL puromycin. After 48 h, cells start dying in the treated conditions. Healthy hybridoma cells are round and regular and grow in clusters. Dead or dying cells lose their round shape and become irregular. Dead cells can be spotted at 0.5 μg/mL, and some live cells remain up to 4 μg/mL. From 8 μg/mL on, cells are clearly dead. A trained eye can easily recognize how viable the cells are. B. To quantify the viability, Trypan blue staining allows to discern live (white) from dead (blue) cells. Here, we selected 8 μg/mL puromycin to conduct the procedure. C. AMAXA cuvette and program (Cell line SF, CQ-104).",
    "Carefully pipette the suspension containing cells and DNA between the electrodes (arrow head) without introducing air bubbles. D. After selection, small clusters start to grow out in HDR-transfected plates among a majority of dying or dead cells (day 6). These resistant cells have successfully undergone HDR. Passage the plates until larger clusters start to grow out (day 10) and grow towards confluency (day 13). In contrast, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transfected hybridoma remain dead and no cluster can be seen (day 13, right). When the plate is full, perform a limiting dilution. E. After limiting dilution, monoclonal cell lines can be easily identified at the bottom of their respective well (arrow heads). Expand and characterize these cell lines.Transfection of hybridoma cells This section describes the electroporation of 1 × 106 wild-type hybridoma cells using gRNA/Cas9 + HDR template or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a mock transfection control. Having cells resuspended for an extended amount of time in SF transfection medium from the SF Cell Line 4D-NucleofectorTM X kit Lis detrimental: work fast and organized and perform transfections sequentially.On day 0, use confluent wild-type hybridoma cells at a high viability (>90%) to perform the electroporation.Add 3 mL of culture medium to a 6-well plate and incubate at 37 °C. Pre-warm culture medium in a 50 mL Falcon.Spin down hybridoma cells from your desired cell line (1,500 rpm, 5 min, 4 °C).Resuspend cell pellet in an appropriate amount of wash buffer (aim for 1 × 106–2 × 106 cells/mL)Count the cells using Trypan blue and transfer 1 × 106 cells to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube.Spin down cell suspensions in a tabletop centrifuge [1,500 × g, 5 min, room temperature (RT)].During this time, prepare two or any desired numbers of DNA mixes in 0.",
    "2 mL Eppendorf tubes, by pipetting 1 μg of Cas9/gRNA + 1 μg of HDR template per condition, and 2 μg of pMAX-GFP as mock transfection control (DNA mix tube).Prepare the 4D-Nucleofector with the parameters: Program CQ-104, Cell line SF.Carefully aspirate supernatant of the cell pellet.Add 100 μL of SF transfection medium to the cell pellet and resuspend cells before transferring into DNA mix tube containing HDR template + gRNA or pMAX-GFP.Resuspend and carefully transfer the suspension to the bottom of a 100 μL electroporation cuvette provided with the Lonza nucleofection kit (Figure 7C). Gently tap the cuvette to ensure that the sample covers the electrodes and the bottom of the cuvette and check that there are no air bubbles.Close the lid and insert the cuvette in AMAXA nucleofector. Press Start on the display to perform electroporation with the parameters: Program CQ-104, Cell line SF (Figure 7C).Carefully add 1 mL of pre-warmed medium to the cuvette and transfer cells immediately to the 6-well plate with pre-warmed medium (total volume in well is now ca. 4 mL). Avoid repeated aspiration of the cells.Wash cuvette with medium to make sure that all cells are transferred.Proceed to the next transfection (repeat from step 8).Incubate the 6-well plate at 37 °C in a humidified CO2 incubator.Selection of engineered hybridoma cells and generation of monoclonal cell lines This section describes the selection of successfully engineered hybridoma cells to identify HDR-edited clones. This is done by antibiotic selection pressure of HDR- and GFP-transfected hybridoma from day 3 post transfection. Resistant cells are grown to confluency and monoclonal cell lines can be generated.Transfected cells are cultured for two days in selection-free medium to allow electroporated cells to grow.",
    "On day 1, check transfected cells for viability (by eye) and the transfection control cells for GFP expression using a fluorescent microscope. Handle cells carefully to preserve viability.On day 3, either scrape the cells loose or resuspend until the cells detach and transfer all 4 mL of cell suspension to a 10 cm Petri dish containing 5 mL of pre-warmed culture medium supplemented with the appropriate selection drug at twice the predetermined concentration (2× selection medium). Wash the well with 1 mL of culture medium to collect all the cells and transfer to the Petri dish. After transferring the cells, the final volume in the Petri dish should be adjusted with culture medium to 10 mL to ensure that cells are in 1× selection medium.Starting on day 5, and two times per week, passage transfected cells. Briefly, scrape cells loose and transfer to 15 mL Falcon tubes. Place 5 mL of new pre-warmed 1× selection medium in the 10 cm Petri dish. Spin down (1,500 rpm, 5 min, RT) and discard supernatant. Resuspend cell pellets in 2 mL of pre-warmed 1× selection medium and transfer suspension back to the Petri dish. Wash the 15 mL Falcon with 3 mL of 1× selection medium and transfer back to the Petri dish.By day 5–10 depending on the antibiotic, it should be obvious that small clusters are forming among a majority of dead cells in the HDR/gRNA-transfected plate, while GFP-transfected cells are all dead (Figure 7D). If no cell death is observed, antibiotic concentration should be adjusted (see Notes). If no live cells grow out following antibiotic pressure, refer to the listed troubleshooting solutions (see Notes).Passage cells until these clusters grow out to reach higher confluency and viability (Figure 7D, >90%, typically around day 15–20).",
    "When the HDR-transfected cells are full, cells should still be all dead in the GFP plate. At this point, discard the GFP-transfected plate, and proceed to limiting dilution of HDR-transfected cells. After this step, antibiotic pressure is not required anymore. In case few clusters grow out very slowly or some cells are still alive in the GFP-transfected plate, it is best to keep the selected antibiotic in the medium until after identification of monoclonal cell lines.Pre-plate 100 μL per well of culture medium in five round bottom 96-well plates and incubate at 37 °C.Scrape confluent HDR-transfected cells loose and spin down the cell suspension (1,500 rpm, 5 min, RT). Keep a 1 mL sample of the supernatant and discard the rest.Resuspend cells in 5 mL of culture medium and count using Trypan blue. Dilute the cells in culture medium in two steps to obtain a 50 mL suspension at the concentration of 3 cells/mL.[Example: Initial suspension is at 1.5 × 106 cells/mL → dilution factor: 500,000 (1.5 × 106/3). First dilute 500×, 100 μL of cell suspension in 50 mL of culture medium (3,000 cells/mL). Then take 50 μL of cell suspension (3,000 cells/mL) and dilute 1,000× in 50 mL culture medium (concentration 3 cells/mL).]Plate 100 μL/well of the suspension in the round bottom 96-well plates. The final concentration is 0.3 cells/well in 200 μL or 33 cells/plate.From the original cell suspension keep ~500,000 cells for genomic DNA (gDNA) isolation (ISOLATE II Genomic DNA kit isolation kit). Spin down and follow manufacturer's instructions.Cryo-preserve leftover cells of the bulk population by following a standard cryo-preservation protocol.While the single-cell clones (SCC) are growing, the bulk population and its supernatant should be characterized immediately for integration of the HDR template. For this, follow section 1–3 in the Data analysis section.",
    "Expansion of modified hybridoma cells Incubate plates for 10–15 days at 37 °C without changing the medium.When SCC are visible at the bottom of the wells (Figure 7E), transfer them to a new flat bottom 96-well plate and add 100 μL of new culture medium.When cells are confluent, collect and freeze supernatant and expand the clones to a 24-well plate and then a T75 flask.Collect ~500,000 cells for gDNA isolation and cryo-preserve the expanded clones."
