    "All experiments involving animal experiments were approved by the responsible authorities in North Rhein Westphalia (LANUV-NRW).\n1. Scanning Electron Microscopy of the Mouse Embryonic Node\nSacrifice the pregnant female mouse at ~ E7.5 (2-4 somite stage) by cervical dislocation. A detailed explanation with diagrams of Steps 1.1 - 1.7 is available in mouse embryo laboratory manuals13.\nOpen the abdomen through the skin and mesenteries and remove the uterus using scissors and fine forceps.\nRinse the uterus briefly in distilled water and place it in a small clean Petri dish (6 cm) containing 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nUnder a dissecting microscope and using fine forceps, remove the uterine muscles to free the individual deciduae or implantation sites.\nHold each decidua with one pair of forceps and use the other pair to make a longitudinal full-thickness incision between the red part (future placenta) and white part (where the embryo is located). Make superficial perforations vertically along the white part of the decidua contiguous with the incision. Pull the decidua apart horizontally into two halves and carefully scoop out the embryo in the white part of the decidua.\nTransfer the embryo to a new Petri dish (35 mm) with fresh sterile-filtered PBS. Repeat for all deciduae/embryos.\nRemove Reichert's membrane, a relatively opaque membrane engulfing the embryo, from each embryo by teasing it away like a sock starting at the ectoplacental cone (reddish implantation site). For genotyping, take a little piece (~ 0.1 mm2) of the yolk sac at this stage.\nUnder a chemical hood and wearing appropriate protection (gloves), transfer the embryos to EM grade fixative composed of 2.5% glutaraldehyde in sterile-filtered PBS in a microcentrifuge (1.5 mL) tube at room temperature. Fix the embryos overnight at 4 °C.",
    "Carefully remove the glutaraldehyde fixative from the tube without touching the embryos and discard in a proper waste container. Wash the embryos three times in sterile-filtered PBS, for 15 min each at room temperature.\nDehydrate the embryos in an ethanol series for 5 min each: 50%, 70%, 85%, and three times in 100% or absolute ethanol. Store the embryos at −20 °C in ethanol or proceed directly to the next step.\nTransfer the embryos in ethanol to baskets for critical point drying (CPD) in a critical point dryer machine. Fill the chamber with ethanol to cover the baskets completely.\nExchange the ethanol by carefully flushing with liquid CO2 for ten times at 10 °C. Drain off liquid CO2 after the last step until the chamber is half full. Heat up to 40 °C until the pressure reaches 80 bars (the critical point) and the liquid CO2 changes to gas. Wait for 10 min then slowly blow off the gas over approximately 45 min.\nAs an easier alternative to CPD for drying, add hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) at a ratio of 1:1 to the embryos in ethanol for 30 min. Then transfer the embryos to pure HMDS for 30 min. Remove the embryos out of the liquid using a pipette and leave them to dry for 30 min.\n\tNOTE: Both drying methods worked equally well in our hands.\nUse a fine brush to mount the dried embryos with the ventral side (node) up on an SEM stub with double sided tape.\nInsert the stubs with the embryos into a sputter coating machine for gold particle coating, which is preferred to charge the long thin cilia. Apply a layer of 120-150 Å; the time is dependent on the current, which will vary with each sample.",
    "Place the coated stubs with embryos into an SEM microscope, apply vacuum and observe the embryonic node and notochordal plate cells with cilia at magnifications ranging from 1000X to 15,000X.\n2. Whole Mount Immunofluorescence of the Mouse Node and Notochordal Plate\nUsing ice-cold PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBSTw), follow Steps 1.1-1.7 above to remove the embryos at E7.75 and place them in PBSTw in a 35 mm Petri dish on ice.\nUnder a chemical hood and wearing appropriate protection (gloves), transfer the embryos to a fixative solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS in a microcentrifuge tube. Fix the embryos overnight at 4 °C.\nCarefully remove the paraformaldehyde fixative from the tube without touching the embryos and discard in a proper waste container. Wash the embryos three times in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 (PBSTr) for 5 min each at room temperature. Perform all the wash and next incubation steps on a nutating shaker.\nRemove the last wash and add blocking solution containing PBSTr with 10% heat-inactivated serum (from the host species of the secondary antibody). Block from 2 h to overnight (or longer) on a nutator at 4 °C.\nRemove the blocking and add ~ 1 mL of the primary antibody diluted in blocking solution, for example an anti-T antibody at 1:500 dilution. Incubate overnight (or longer) on a nutator at 4 °C.\nRemove the primary antibody and save it for later use by adding sodium azide to a final concentration of 0.02% (1 µL of 20% stock to 1 mL of antibody solution). The antibody can be reused ~ 10 times. Rinse the embryos twice with PBSTr and then wash them three times for 30 min each on a nutator at 4 °C.",
    "Replace the wash with a fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibody, against the primary antibody host species, diluted at ~ 1:1000 overnight (or longer) on a nutator at 4 °C.\nRemove the secondary antibody and rinse twice with PBSTr, then wash three times for 30 min with PBSTr.\nReplace the last wash with PBSTr containing 1:500 fluorescence-conjugated phalloidin, to stain F-Actin, and 1:1000 DAPI, to stain nuclei, for 1 h at room temperature.\nRinse twice in PBSTr and wash once with PBSTr for 30 min at room temperature.\nReplace PBSTr with PBS and leave the embryos on ice. Prepare clean positively-charged slides (60 x 24 mm) and coverslips (24 x 24 mm) and aqueous glycerol-based mounting media, for example, 90% glycerol in 1xPBS and an antifade reagent, to mount the embryos.\nPut two pieces of clear tape at a distance of ~ 15 mm from each other on the clear part of the slide. This will create enough 3D space (in the Z dimension) that would allow flattening the embryos but not completely squishing them.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, carefully move the embryos using a cut P200 pipette (to allow enough space for the embryo to be transferred and not damaged) to the slide.\nUsing fine forceps, make two full cuts on the lateral sides of the yolk sac to unfold the embryo. Place the embryo with the ventral side (node and notochordal plate) up (dorsal of neural tube down on the slide).",
    "Add 50 µL of mounting media on the embryo. Place 4-5 embryos per slide. Add a dab of mounting media to the side of the coverslip that will first touch the slide (top or bottom side), then place it straddling the two pieces of tape and lower it slowly onto the embryos using fine forceps or a bent fine needle while avoiding creating air bubbles.\nClean the excess mounting media by using an absorbent wipe. Be careful not to move the coverslip in the process.\nUsing a generous amount of nail polish, seal the sides of the coverslip without moving it.\nObserve under a scanning confocal microscope."
