This workflow can be readily adapted for other lymphoid tissues, including lymph nodes, thymus or bone marrow.\nDissect spleens into dissection medium kept on ice or at 18°C–23°C.\nOptional: If analysis of innate immune cell populations is required, perform collagenase digestion:\nTransfer individual spleens into a well of a 6-well plate.\nAdd 4 mL of 18°C–23°C dissection medium.\nUsing a scalpel with a fresh blade, finely chop spleens into 15 or more pieces to maximize surface area for the following enzymatic digestion step.\nAdd 1 mL of 5–10 mg/mL Collagenase type IV, resulting in a final concentration of 1–2 mg/mL.\nIncubate in a 37°C incubator (5% CO2) for 25–30 min.\nStop reactions with addition of 2 mM EDTA.\nNote: If only T-cell and B-cell analysis is required from spleens, there is no need to perform collagenase digestion as these cells are liberated without the need for enzymatic digestion.\nPass spleens through a 40 μm cell strainer, placed on top of a 50 mL conical tube.\nThis process should be facilitated using the plunger of a 20 mL syringe to mash tissue through the mesh.\nRinse through with 2 mL ice cold flow cytometry buffer. Allow the cell strainer to drain and repeat 1–2 more times.\nPellet immune cells by centrifuging in a cold (4°C) benchtop centrifuge at 500 × g (approximately 1,200–1,500 RPM in a conventional lab benchtop centrifuge) for 5 min.",
    "Optional: Red blood cell lysis can be performed at this stage, using 1× RBC Lysis buffer by following manufacturer’s instructions (https://assets.fishersci.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/00-4333.pdf[href=https://assets.fishersci.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/00-4333.pdf]). In our experience, an additional RBC lysis step is not necessary to facilitate downstream flow cytometry analysis, but it can aid in the accurate quantification of lymphoid cells.\nResuspend cell pellets in 2 mL chilled (4°C) flow cytometry buffer by gently vortexing.\nNote: The aim of this step is to resuspend cells at a concentration of ∼2 × 107 – 1 × 108 cells/mL to facilitate downstream cell counting and sample aliquoting. It is anticipated that a spleen from an 8–12 week old female C57BL/6J mouse would comprise 5 × 107-1 × 108 cells. Resuspension volume should therefore be adjusted based on expected cell recoveries. Samples can be pelleted & re-suspended by following steps 3 and 4, or further diluted as needed.\nCount cells using a hemocytometer or automated cell counter (e.g., Countess Cell Counting Chamber Slides and Countess 3 Automated Cell Counter (AMQAX2000)).\nNote: In our experience, a counter stain such as trypan blue is not essential to accurately quantitate immune cells for the purposes of this protocol. Bright, circular immune cells with clearly defined membrane should be counted, and consistency in live cell counting should be maintained across samples.\nAliquot ∼2–5 × 105 cells from each single cell suspension into a well of a 96-well v-bottom tissue culture plate (plate A) to be processed for staining panel A. The plate should be kept on ice or at 4°C for the further duration of the protocol.\nRepeat step 6, to prepare a 96-well v-bottom tissue culture plate containing sample (plate B) for evaluation by staining panel B.",
    "Note: This protocol can be readily adapted to evaluate immune cell populations from non-lymphoid tissues or solid tumors. In general, all non-lymphoid tissue preparation will involve an enzymatic digestion step with collagenase or a suitable alternative in order to liberate cells. Detailed digestion protocols for several tissues,5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] or from solid tumors6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] have been published.\nExtracellular and intracellular flow cytometry staining\nTiming: 3–5 h\nThe next step of the protocol involves staining of immune cell populations with fluorescently labeled antibodies to enable discrimination of cell populations.\nCentrifuge plate A and plate B at 500 × g for 4 min in a 4°C benchtop centrifuge equipped with a microplate holder to pellet the cells. Remove the supernatant by flicking the plate into a sink following a single continuous motion [troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]].\nCritical: Do not blot or dry residual liquid from the plate, to avoid dislodging cell pellets and/or cross-contamination between samples.\nResuspend cells in 100 μL live/dead blue stain, through gentle repetitive pipetting. Incubate at 4°C for 10–15 min.\nNote: Use of a multichannel pipette can increase sample preparation consistency and reduce processing times.\nTop up wells with 100 μL 4°C flow cytometry buffer and centrifuge (500 × g at 4°C) for 4 min. Remove the supernatant through aspiration or by flicking the plate into a sink following a single continuous motion.\nAdd 100 μL/well flow cytometry buffer and centrifuge (500 × g at 4°C) to pellet cells. Remove the supernatant through aspiration or by flicking the plate into a sink following a single continuous motion.\nResuspend cells from plate A in 75 μL/well staining panel A – extracellular antibody panel. Resuspend cells from plate B in 75 μL/well staining panel B – extracellular antibody panel. Perform surface staining for 30–60 min at 4°C in the dark [troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]].",
    "Note: Precise antibody cocktails can be modified as needed to address desired experimental questions. A broader list of antibodies and working dilutions that we have validated previously as part of our characterization of a T-cell lymphoma models have been published previously.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nTop up wells in plate A with 125 μL 4°C PBS and centrifuge (500 × g at 4°C) for 4 min. Remove the supernatant through aspiration or by flicking the plate into a sink following a single continuous motion.\nResuspend plate A in 75 μL BD Cytofix Fixation buffer and incubate for 10–15 min at 4°C.\nTop up wells in plate A with 125 μL ice cold PBS and centrifuge (500 × g at 4°C) for 4 min. Remove the supernatant through aspiration or by flicking the plate into a sink following a single continuous motion.\nNote: BD Cytofix fixation buffer reagent contains paraformaldehyde which may be harmful. Use with care and dispose any waste according to institutional regulations.\nResuspend samples in plate A with 150 μL PBS.\nPause point: Plate A can be stored in the dark at 4°C for 24–48 h before analysis by flow cytometry.\nTop up wells in plate B with 125 μL 4°C PBS and centrifuge (500 × g at 4°C) for 4 min. Remove the supernatant through aspiration or by flicking the plate into a sink following a single continuous motion.\nResuspend plate B in 75 μL/well fix/perm solution for 20–30 min at 4°C.\nTop up wells in plate B with 125 μL ice cold Perm/wash buffer and centrifuge (500 × g at 4°C) for 4 min. Remove the supernatant through aspiration or by flicking the plate into a sink following a single continuous motion.",
    "Resuspend plate B in 75 μL/well staining panel B – intracellular antibody panel. Incubate at 4°C in the dark for 30–45 min.\nTop up wells in plate B with 125 μL ice cold Perm/wash buffer and centrifuge (500 × g at 4°C) for 4 min. Remove the supernatant through aspiration or by flicking the plate into a sink following a single continuous motion.\nResuspend samples in plate B with 75 μL perm/wash buffer. Top up with 75 μL PBS.\nNote: fix/perm buffer contains formaldehyde, which is toxic. Use with care and dispose waste according to institutional regulations.\nNote: fix/perm and perm/wash buffers contain a detergent which creates holes in the plasma and nuclear membranes, allowing fluorescent antibodies to penetrate and stain antigens. Cells must be kept in the presence of permeabilization reagent throughout all intracellular staining steps.\nPause point: plate B can be stored in the dark at 4°C for 24–48 h before analysis by flow cytometry.\nSample acquisition on 4 laser BD Fortessa flow cytometer with high throughput sample loader equipped\nTiming: 2–4 h\nThe next step of the protocol involves acquisition of flow cytometry data. Fixed samples can be kept at 18°C–23°C for the duration of the protocol, and should be kept in the dark to prevent.\nOptional: Samples can be passed through a 40 μm cell straining prior to acquisition. This can be done in a high-throughput manner using for example Pall AcroPrep 96-well 40 μm Filter plates. This will minimize the risk that any clumping of dead cells in the sample will clog the flow cytometer fluidics.\nPrepare flow cytometry compensation controls using UltraComp eBeads™ Plus Compensation Beads according to manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2F01-2222.pdf[href=https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2F01-2222.pdf]).",
    "The BD Fortessa should be calibrated and voltages optimized, acquisition parameters and plate labels should be set up using BD FACSDiva software all according to the instructions in the BD FACSDiva software reference manual.\nSet up an acquisition worksheet in FACSDiva to enable visualization of sample acquisition.\nVisualize dot plots showing a basic gating structure with total lymphocytes (FSC vs. SSC), live cells (viability dye-negative in FSC vs. viability dye), singlet cells (FSC-A vs. FSC-H) and congenic markers CD45.1 vs. CD45.2.\nSet up plate on high-throughput screen (HTS) mode on the BD Fortessa.\nTest sample flow rate using <5 μL spare sample and adjust if necessary to achieve a flow rate of 1,000–5,000 events/second.\nAcquire and record data from all samples.\nFollowing acquisition of samples, export data as an .FCS file.\nImport files into FlowJo.\nUsing single color compensation controls, create and apply a compensation matrix and apply to experimental samples. For detailed instructions on creating and applying a compensation matrix, refer to the Traditional Compensation in FlowJo tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H17WUe7Vlbg[href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H17WUe7Vlbg], FlowJo Media).\nAnalyze data in FlowJo software.\nCritical: Antibody fluorophores must be compatible for use with the particular flow cytometer instrument configuration and laser set up. Alternative antibody panels and/or differential use of fluorophores can be optimized and/or considered, depending on the flow cytometry capabilities available."
