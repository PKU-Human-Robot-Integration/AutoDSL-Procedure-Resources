Next, we will purify the cell population by magnetic beads sorting or by flow cytometry sorting.\nIsolate type II cells from mouse lungs (See Methods Video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1])\nPerfuse the lung with 10 mL PBS at 20°C–25°C via the pulmonary artery (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/338-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Isolating type II cells from mouse lung.\n(A) Dissecting the mouse lung for type II cell isolation. Step 1: perfuse the lung with 10 mL PBS via the pulmonary artery. Step 2: inject 2 mL dispase through the trachea followed by 0.5 mL agarose (2% in PBS).\n(B) Isolated type II cells were fixed on glass slides by cytospin centrifugation and stained with antibody to type II cell marker Sp-C. Scale bar, 40 μm.\nInstill 2 mL dispase into the lung through trachea followed by 0.5 mL melted agarose (2% in PBS) (~45°C) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nImmediately cover the lung with ice for 2 min to let the agarose solidify and seal the upper airways.\nNote: 0.5 mL agarose (2% in PBS) (~45°C) injected after the dispase seal the upper airways and block most of the airway cells from dissociation. In this way, we minimize the contamination of club cells in our type II cell isolation.\nTie the trachea and remove the lung from the mouse using forceps. Incubate the lung in 0.5 mL dispase in a 15 mL tube for 45 min at 20°C–25°C.",
    "Transfer the lung to a 60 mm tissue culture dish containing 5 mL of HEPES-buffered DMEM with 100 unit/mL DNase I. Gently tease the lung tissue into small pieces (smaller than 2 mm3) from the bronchi. Cut 2–3 mm from the tip of a 1 mL pipette tip and use it to pipette the tissue pieces up and down to further dissociate the cells. Incubate the cells at 20°C–25°C for 10 min.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer and then nylon gauze (20 μm pore size) to get single cell suspension in a 15 mL centrifuge tube.\nNote: After the serial filtration, most cells left in the mixture should be single cells. To minimize the cell loss, after the 5 mL cells are filtered through the 70 μm cell strainer, 1 mL of additional HEPES-buffered DMEM can be added to the 60 mm tissue culture dish to collect residual cells and filter through the same cell strainer to be combined with the rest of the cells.\nCentrifuge cells at 130 × g for 8 min at 4°C in a centrifuge suitable for 15 mL centrifuge tubes.\nNote: We used a relatively low speed (130 × g). In this way, most of the type I cells will be removed.\nRe-suspend cells in 5 mL HEPES-buffered DMEM.\nPlace cells in tissue culture plates coated with CD45 and CD32 antibodies.\nIncubate cells at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 1 h.",
    "Note: Occasionally, cell aggregates are seen after 1 h of incubation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). In this case, add an additional aliquot of DNase I directly to the plate. Gently rock and swirl the plate to make it evenly disperse into the medium and incubate the plate for another 10 min. Proceeding with cell aggregates would compromise the purity and yield of the isolation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/338-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cell aggregates in step 1J\nScale bar, 1,000 μm.\nTransfer suspending cells from the plate into a 15 mL tube and pellet the cells by centrifugation at 130 × g for 8 min.\nRe-suspend cells in 1 mL RBC lysis buffer and transfer to 1.5 mL centrifuge tubes. Incubate cells on ice for 1 min.\nNote: If the lung is perfused well, one-minute incubation should be enough to remove all red blood cells. Longer incubation could result in lower type II cell viability. In case 1 min is not enough to remove all blood cells, the procedure can be repeated one more time.\nSpin down cells at 400 × g for 3 min at 4°C and wash cells in PBS twice.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods Video S1. Lung perfusion and intratracheal instillation, refer to step 1\nNote: The cell yield at this stage is ~3 × 106 per mouse.\nPurify the cells with magnetic beads sorting\nRe-suspend cells in 250 μL of FACS buffer (PBS + 2% FBS).",
    "Note: In experiments with S1P treatment, use charcoal stripped FBS instead of regular FBS in FACS buffer. To make charcoal stripped FBS, add 1 g dextran-coated charcoal to 50 mL FBS and shake gently on a shaker at 4°C for 16–18 h. After incubation, remove the charcoal by first centrifuging it down at 2,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C and then filtering the supernatant through a 70 μm cell strainer and a 0.2 μm syringe filter sequentially.\nAdd 4 μL of biotin conjugated anti-EpCAM antibody to the cells and incubate for 45 min on a rotator at 4°C.\nSpin down the cells at 400 × g for 3 min and then re-suspend in 1 mL FACS buffer to wash. Repeat the wash twice and after the last wash, re-suspend cells in 500 μL FACS buffer. Add 20 μL of streptavidin conjugated magnetic beads and incubate for 30 min at 4°C with rotation.\nWash cells in 1 mL of MACS buffer (1× PBS, 0.5% BSA, 2 mM EDTA-pH 7.2) twice, re-suspend in 500 μL MACS buffer and arrange tubes in a magnetic rack (Sigma GE28-9489-64).\nNote: We recommend making fresh FACS and MACS buffer each time for the isolation since it is hard to keep the buffers sterile over time.\nNote: In experiments with S1P treatments, use fatty acid free BSA instead of regular BSA in MACS buffer.\nLet the cells bind for 8 min on ice and remove negative/unbound fraction with a 1 mL pipette.\nRe-suspend positive/bound fraction in 1 mL of MACS buffer.\nLet the cells bind for 8 min and remove negative/unbound fraction with a 1 mL pipette.\nRepeat step f and g one more time.",
    "Stain the cells with trypan blue dye and determine viability and yield. Cell viability is ~70% and yield is ~5 × 105 per mouse at this stage.\nDetermine the purity of isolated type II cells\nCentrifuge cells onto glass slides using a cytospin centrifuge: re-suspend 2–5 × 104 cells in 150 μL PBS. Spin for 5 min at 500 rpm (28 × g).\nDry the cells for 5 min at 20°C–25°C. Circle the cells on slides with a hydrophobic pen.\nFix cells in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) at 20°C–25°C for 15 min. Wash slides in PBS for 3 times.\nPause Point: Cytospin slides can be stored in PBS at 4°C for about a week.\nStain cells with antibody against type II cell marker Sp-C (Kalina et al., 1992[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Korfhagen et al., 1990[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) using general immunofluorescence staining procedures. (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B)\nNote: We use a rabbit anti pro-Sp-C antibody (see details in Key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) and fluorescence conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies in the immunofluorescence staining. See (Chen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and (Liu et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) for more details.\nOptional: The purity of isolated type II cells can also be determined by a PAP assay (Dobbs, 1990[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nNote: By magnetic beads purification, we got ~500,000 cells each mouse. The purity is 95.6% ± 0.04%.\nCritical: 0.5 mL agarose (2% in PBS) (~45°C) is injected after the dispase. In this way, most of the airway club cells are blocked from dissociation and thus the contamination by club cells is minimum.\nCritical: In the first several centrifugations, we used a relatively slow speed (130 × g). In this way, most of the type I cells will be removed.\nPause Point: After fixation, cytospin slides can be stored in PBS at 4°C for about a week.",
    "Alternatives: Type II cells can also be purified by FACS sorting. In FACS sorting, type II cells are isolated by fluorescent lineage labeling (Tomato for SpC-CreER/ROSA-Tomato mice or GFP for SpC-CreER/mTmG mice) and DAPI is added to exclude the dead cells. Sorting was done using the Beckman Coulter MoFlo Astrios Cell Sorter in the flow cytometry core at the University of Illinois at Chicago (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/338-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Gate for FASC sorting of type II cells\nType II cells were sorted with gates for forward, side scatter, DAPI, and lineage markers (depending on the lineage labeling lines used; e.g., Tomato for SpC-CreER/ROSA-Tomato mice or GFP for SpC-CreER/mTmG mice).\n2D culture of isolated type II cells\nTiming: 4–7 days\nIn this part, we culture the isolated type II cells in a 2D culture system. Cells are cultured on coverslips for antibody staining or directly in culture plates for qRT-PCR experiments. In the 2D condition, type II cells undergo transition into type I-like cells in 4–7 days.\nCulture type II cells in 24-well plates\nPlace a 15 mm round glass coverslip in each well to be used of a 24-well plate.\nCoat coverslips or wells with 250 μL 0.2% gelatin (prepared in Milli Q water, heated to dissolve and sterile filtered). Coat for 1–18 h in a 37°C cell culture incubator.\nAlternatives: Coverslips and culture wells can also be coated with 0.01% collagen (Collagen I, rat tail). When coating the coverslips and culture plates, dilute collagen in sterile water to 0.01% (w/v) and add 250 μL per well in a 24- well plate. Coat for 1–18 h in a 37°C cell culture incubator.\nBefore plating cells, pipette off gelatin solution and allow the coverslips or culture wells to dry for at least 2 h inside a tissue culture hood.",
    "Critical: It is important to completely dry the plate before seeding the cells for better cell attachment.\nRe-suspend isolated type II cell pellet in media (HEPES-buffered DMEM, see ”Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” for details). Plate 150,000–200,000 type II cells in each well, 500 μL per well.\nCritical: In experiments with S1P treatment, add charcoal stripped FBS instead of regular FBS in cell culture medium.\nNote: Some type II cell may die at 24–48 h after culture. To increase survival rate, it is important not to disturb the cells too much. Let cells sit for 48 h, then change medium.\nTreat the cultured type II cells with S1P or JTE-013\nStock solution of S1P was made in ethanol at 1 mM and stored at −20°C.\nAliquot enough S1P solution needed for the experiment. Evaporate ethanol under inert gas, i.e., nitrogen or argon, in the tissue culture hood and reconstitute S1P to 125 μM in 4 mg/mL fatty acid free BSA made in sterile water.\nCritical: The reconstituted S1P should be made fresh every time and apply to the cells immediately after made.\nNote: We recommend using inert gas to dry S1P to minimize oxidation. An alternative method is to use a speed vacuum centrifuge.\nAdd S1P to cell culture medium containing charcoal stripped FBS to a final concentration of 1 μM.\nCritical: Regular FBS contains high concentration of S1P. Make sure to use charcoal stripped FBS in experiments with S1P treatment.\nChange half of the medium (250 μL per well) every day with freshly made S1P.",
    "Note: S1P turns over quickly and thus fresh S1P needs to be added to the culture every day. However, type II cells attach loosely in the first 2 days of culture. Therefore, caution should be taken to minimize the disturbance to the cells when changing the medium. We change only half of the medium, and when changing the medium, we keep the plate flat instead of tilted and add fresh medium slowly along the side of the culture wells.\nTo treat cells with JTE-013, dilute 20 mM JTE-013 (DMSO stock solution) in culture medium containing 10% regular FBS to a final concentration of 10 μM and add to the cells. Add same amount of DMSO to the control wells. Change medium after 2 days.\nAnalyze the treated cells:\nFix cells with 4% PFA for 10 min at 20°C–25°C, remove PFA, and gently wash the cells with 1 mL PBS. Proceed for antibody staining for type I cell markers HopX and Ager (Yang et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]) (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/338-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. 2D culture of isolated type II cells\n(A) At 24 h after culture initiation, most cells remained to be cuboidal shape.\n(B) After cultured for 5 days, most cells acquired flattened type I cell-like shape.\n(C) At 24 h culturing, most of the cells still express Sp-C.\n(D and E) At 5 days culturing, many of the cells started to express type I cell marker HopX (D) or Ager (E).\nScale bar, 50 μm for (A) and (B), 70 μm for (C) and (D), 10 μm for (E).",
    "Or, lyse the cells in 1 mL Trizol and proceed for RNA extraction using a RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=14e7cf6e-521a-4cf7-8cbc-bf9f6fa33e24&lang=en[href=https://www.qiagen.com/us/resources/resourcedetail?id=14e7cf6e-521a-4cf7-8cbc-bf9f6fa33e24%26lang=en]) and qRT-PCR to assess the expression of AT1 and AT2 marker genes, such as Sp-C for AT2 cells and HopX and Ager for AT1 cells (Chen et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\n3D co-culture of isolated type II cells with Mlg fibroblasts\nTiming: 3 weeks\nIn this part, we will culture the isolated type II cells in a 3D culture system together with mouse lung fibroblasts Mlg on 24-well Transwell inserts. In this condition, type II cells will generate alveoli-like cysts consisting of both type I type I and type II cells and the progenitor properties of type II cells are maintained.\nPrepare for 3D culture: Grow Mlg and prepare Transwell insert. See above in “Prepare reagents for type II cell isolation and culture[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.2]” for details\nCulture isolated type II cells with Mlg fibroblasts in 3D inserts\nCollect freshly isolated type II cells after either magnetic bead sorting or FACS sorting.\nPellet cells and re-suspend sorted type II cells at 100 cells/μL in 3D culture media (See “Materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]” for details).\nTrypsinize the cultured Mlg cells and re-suspend at 2,000 cells/μL in 3D culture media\nNote: Mlg cells harvested from one 75 mm flask at ~80% confluency are usually resuspended in ~1 mL medium.\nPrepare Matrigel: thaw Matrigel on ice at 4°C for several hours.\nNote: We put 1 mL aliquots of Matrigel in a small styrofoam box with ice inside a 4°C refrigerator and let it thaw about 3–4 h before use.\nIn sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes, add\n100 μL of the Matrigel +\n50 μL of Mlg (@100,000 cells/well) +\n50 μL of type II (@5,000 cells/well)",
    "Mix the cells and Matrigel well and plate the mixture (total 200 μL) in Transwell inserts\nCritical: Matrigel starts to solidify above 10°C. Make sure to keep Matrigel, tubes, and cells on ice when making the mixture. Pre-chilling the tubes and pipette tips can be helpful.\nNote: Be gentle when mixing the cell and Matrigel and when plating the mixture to the Transwell to avoid bubbles.\nIncubate the plates for 30 min in a tissue culture incubator to solidify the Matrigel and then add 600 μL of warm 3D culture medium to the lower chamber\nNote: Do not add medium in the Transwell inserts. Alveolar organoids are grown in an air-liquid interface.\nGrow cells in inserts for up to three weeks and change medium every other day.\nObserve Tomato+ or GFP+ colonies in the Matrigel.\nTo fix cells in the Transwell inserts for further analysis, discard the culture medium and add 600 μL of 20°C–25°C 4% PFA to the wells. Cells are fixed at 20°C–25°C for 20 min and then further fixed at 4°C for 2 days (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/338-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. 3D co-culture of type II cells and Mlg\n(A) Scheme of 3D co-culture of Mlg and type II cells using Transwell inserts.\n(B) 2 weeks after culture, numerous colonies were formed as shown by GFP from the lineage tracing system of SpC-CreER/mTmG mice.\n(C) The inserts were processed for paraffin embedding, sectioning, and antibody staining. One of the colonies was shown to be composed of Sp-C expressing type II cells and T1α expressing type I cells. Scale bar, 1 mm for (B), 30 μm for (C).\nAfter fixation, carefully peel off the membrane from the bottom of the Transwell insert and remove the Matrigel plug from the Transwell insert.",
    "Note: The Matrigel plug will still be soft after fixation, so be careful not to poke into the Matrigel when peeling off the membrane. We found that it is easier to remove the Matrigel plug by gently knocking the Transwell insert upside down and let the Matrigel plug to fall by itself.\nTo treat cells with JTE-013, add 10 μM JTE-013 to purified type II cells before mixing with Matrigel and to the 3D culture medium added to the wells. Change medium every other day with fresh JTE-013 added for 2–3 weeks.\nAlternatives: Primary PDGFRα+ fibroblast cells can be FACS isolated and used in 3D organoid culture instead of Mlg. Type II cells co-cultured with PDGFRα+ fibroblast give rise to more and larger organoids."
