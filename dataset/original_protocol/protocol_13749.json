    "All animal experiments were approved and performed according to the regulations of the Regional Council of Karlsruhe and the University of Heidelberg (AZ 35-9185.82/A-2/15, AZ 35-9185.82/A-18/15, AZ 35-9185.81/G131/15, AZ 35-9185.81/G121/17) conform to the guidelines from Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. Data shown in this protocol are derived from wild type C57Bl6/N male mice (17 ± 1.4 weeks of age). Mice were maintained under specified pathogen-free conditions at the animal facility (IBF) of the Heidelberg Medical Faculty. Mice were housed in a 12-hour light-dark cycle, with a relative humidity between 56-60%, a 15-times air change per hour and room temperature of 22°C +/- 2°C. They were kept in conventional cages type II or type II long provided with animal bedding and tissue papers as enrichment. Standard autoclaved food and autoclaved water were available to consume ad libitum.\n1. Preparation of instruments and drug solutions\nCentral venous catheter: Cut the micro tube (0.6 mm outer diameter) into ~20 cm long catheter tubes. Use forceps to pull one end of the tube onto the tip of a 23-gauge cannula. Cut the other end of the tubing diagonally to create a sharp tip that can pierce the femoral vein.\nEndotracheal tube: For an intubation tube cut a 20-gauge venipuncture-cannula 3 cm in length to remove the syringe attachment.",
    "If the intubation tube does not fit the ventilator connection perfectly, wrap parafilm over the end of the tube where the ventilation device is connected. The connection must be stable and sealed by the thickening (Figure 1A). Shorten the metal guide pin of the 20-gauge venipuncture-cannula to 2.7 cm and use it as an intubation aid. Refined approaches for intubation including light fibers to facilitate visualization of the trachea are also well described, for example by Das and collaborators16.\nAnesthetic mixture used for intubation: Mix 200 µL of heparin (1000 IU/mL) with 50 µL of 0.9% NaCl and 750 µL of 2 mg/mL etomidate from an oil-in-water emulsion based product. Use 7 µL/g body weight (BW) for each mouse (0.1 mg/kg BW Buprenorphine 10 mg/kg BW etomidate).\nMuscle relaxant: Dissolve 100 mg of Pancuronium-bromide in 100 mL of 0.9% NaCl. Use 1.0 µL/g body weight (1 mg/kg BW) for each mouse.\nIsoproterenol solutions: Dissolve 100 mg of isoproterenol in 100 mL of 0.9% NaCl (1 µg/µL). Prepare the following dilutions (Table 1) and transfer each in a 1 mL syringe.\n\t\nTo obtain dilution 1, dilute the stock 1:1.8. To obtain dilution 2, dilute the stock 1:6. To obtain dilution 3, dilute dilution 1 into 1:10. Finally, obtain dilution 4 by a 1:10 dilution of dilution 2.\n15% Hypertonic NaCl (w/v): Dissolve 1.5 g of 0.9% NaCl in 10 mL of double distilled H2O. Filter the solution with a 0.45 µm pore syringe filter.\nPreparation of 12.5% albumin solution (w/v): Dissolve 1.25 g of bovine serum albumin in 10 mL of 0.9% NaCl. Incubate the solution at 37 °C for 30 min. Cool down to room temperature and filter the solution with a 0.45 µm pore syringe filter.",
    "Preparation of the setup: First switch on the heating plate and set it to 39-40 °C. Place a syringe filled with saline on the heating pad and transfer the pressure-volume loop (PVL) catheter into the syringe. Pre-incubate the catheter for at least 30 min before use for stabilization. The setup we use consist of a 1.4-F pressure-conductance catheter, a control unit and the corresponding software, and it is graphically described on Figure 1B and provider references are listed in the Table of Materials.\n2. Anesthesia\nInject buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg BW intraperitoneally) 30 min before intubation.\nPlace the mouse into an acrylic glass-chamber pre-saturated with 2.5% isoflurane and pre-warmed with a heating pad placed on the base of the chamber.\nAs soon as the mouse sleeps (lack of reflex), inject the anesthetic mixture (7 mL/kg BW) containing 10 mg/kg etomidate and heparin (1,200 IU/kg BW) intraperitoneally.\n3. Ventilation\nTransfer the animal to the intubation platform (Figure 1C) 3-4 minutes after the anesthetic injection. The mouse hangs from the teeth with the dorsal view facing the operator.\nGently lift the tongue with forceps. To identify the glottis, lift the mouse's lower jaw slightly with second forceps.\nCarefully insert the endotracheal tube (Figure 1A) into the trachea and remove the guide rod.\nTransfer the animal onto the heating plate, place it on the back and connect the intubation tube to the small animal respirator.\nAdjust respiratory rate to 53.5 x (Body weight in grams)-0.26 [min-1], as described by others12, and tidal volumes to peak inspiratory pressures of 11 ± 1 cmH2O. Establish a PEEP of 2 cmH2O.\nFix carefully the extremities of the mouse on the heating plate with adhesive strips and apply eye ointment on both eyes to prevent dryness.",
    "Insert a rectal temperature probe and maintain core body temperature at 37 ± 0.2 °C.\nInstall a 1-lead ECG and monitor the heart rate on-line as an indicator for anesthesia depth and stability.\nUpon absence of interdigital reflexes, inject 1 mg/kg BW of the muscle relaxant pancuronium-bromide intraperitoneally. This prevents respiratory artifacts during PVL measurements.\n4. Surgery\nGeneral recommendations\n\t\nDuring surgery, ventilate with ~1.5-2% isoflurane vaporized with O2. The isoflurane concentration can also depend on variables like mouse strain, gender, age and weight of the animals, but it needs to be individually and experimentally determined and the values here are reference for the C57BL6/N mouse strain. Importantly, the ventilator is connected to an extraction system to prevent the operator from inhaling isoflurane.\nUse a magnification between 1.5-4x from the stereo microscope for surgical procedures.\n\t\tNOTE: Refer to institutional/local guidance on preparation of the animal for non-survival surgeries.\nFemoral cannulation\n\t\nRinse the hindlimb with 70% ethanol, incise the left inguinal region and expose the left femoral vein.\nBlast the epigastric artery and vein with a cautery.\nLigate the femoral vein with a suture placed distal to the catheter access.\nPass a suture underneath the femoral vein and prepare a knot cranial of puncture site. Puncture the femoral vein with the prepared micro tube (see step 1.1) attached to a 1 mL syringe.\nTie down the knot to fix the tube inside the vessel.\nCounteract fluid loss by the infusion of 0.9% NaCl supplemented with 12.5% albumin at an infusion rate of 15 µL/min with an automatic syringe pump. Additionally, keep exposed tissue humid using pre-warmed 0.9% NaCl.\nThoracotomy\n\t\nRinse the thorax with 70% ethanol.\nIncise the skin just beneath the xyphoid process and bluntly separate the pectoral muscles from the chest wall with forceps or a cautery.",
    "Lift the xyphoid process with forceps, and then cut through the chest wall moving laterally on both sides with a cautery until the diaphragm is fully visible from beneath.\nIncise the diaphragm from beneath and expose the cardiac apex. Then carefully remove the pericardium with forceps.\nPerform a limited costotomy on the left side as previously described6.\nPass a suture beneath the inferior caval vein to perform preload reduction during later stages.\nGently puncture the cardiac apex with a 25-gauge cannula (maximal 4 mm). Remove the cannula and insert the PV catheter until all electrodes are within the ventricle.\nAdjust the position of the catheter by gentle movements and turns until rectangular shaped loops are obtained (Figure 2A).\nKeep always all exposed tissue humid using pre-warmed 0.9% NaCl.\n5. Measurements\nGeneral recommendations\n\t\nDuring measurements, ventilate with ~1.5-2% isoflurane vaporized with 100% O2.\nPerform 2 baseline measurements as well as 2 vena cava occlusions on each step of the dose response protocol.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important that after the first and second vena cava occlusion, both pressure and volume values return to steady-state values as before the first occlusion. This observation is necessary in order to recognize a shift in catheter position due to serial reductions in intraventricular volume. If a shift in catheter position would be the case, especially volume values would be shifted.\nPerform an on-line analysis of parameters (heart rate, stroke volume, dP/dtmax) and wait until steady-state cardiac function is obtained. For the expected parameter range with the here used setting in C57Bl6/N mice please refer to published results6.",
    "Stop the respirator at end-expiratory position and record baseline parameters. After 3 to 5 seconds reduce cardiac preload by lifting the suture beneath the inferior caval vein with forceps in order to obtain preload independent parameters (Figure 2B). Turn the ventilator on. Wait at least 30 seconds for the second occlusion until hemodynamic parameters are stabilized.\nAfter obtaining the measurements under basal conditions proceed to the dose-response of isoproterenol by switching to the prepared syringes. Here the infusion rate stays unchanged in order to avoid modifications of the cardiac preload. Take care not to infuse air bubbles when changing the syringe.\n\t\nWait at least 2 minutes until new steady-state cardiac function is obtained than again stop the respirator at end-expiratory position and record baseline parameters. After 3 to 5 seconds reduce cardiac preload by lifting the suture beneath the inferior caval vein in order to obtain preload independent parameters.\nWait at least 30 seconds for the second occlusion. Afterwards switching to the prepared syringe with the next isoproterenol concentration and repeat the recordings of baseline and preload independent parameters.\n\t\tNOTE: Artifacts like the end-systolic pressure-spike (ESPS, Figure 2C) can occur during the increase in the dosage of isoproterenol, which results from catheter entrapment. Artefacts that occur before the start of basal parameters can be easily corrected via re-positioning of the catheter.\n6. Calibration\nNOTE: Calibration procedures may vary depending on the PVL system used.\nParallel-conductance calibration\n\t\nConnect a syringe containing a 15% NaCl solution to the femoral cannula after the last measurement from the isoproterenol dose-response. Carefully infuse 5 µL of the hypertonic solution remaining in the tube until PVL slightly shift to the right during on-line visualization. Then wait until the loops come back to steady-state.",
    "Stop the respirator at end-expiration and inject one bolus of 10 µL of 15% NaCl within 2 to 3 seconds. Check if PVL largely broaden and are shifted to the right during on-line visualization.\nConductance-to-volume calibration\n\t\nWait 5 min, no less, so that the hypertonic saline bolus is completely diluted. Afterwards remove the catheter and draw at least 600 μL blood from the left ventricle of the beating heart using a 1 mL syringe and a 21-gauge cannula. At this time point the animal is euthanized under deep anesthesia and analgesia by massive bleeding, by stopping the ventilation and removal of the heart.\nTransfer the blood into the pre-warmed (in a water bath at 37 °C) calibration cuvette with cylinders of known volume. Place the PV catheter centrally in each cylinder and record the conductance. By calculating a standard curve for each animal, the conductance units can be converted into absolute volume values.\n7. Analysis\nAfter successful PVL measurements under basal conditions and isoproterenol stimulation, visualize, digitalize, calculate and extract parameters characterizing cardiac function (like PRSW, dP/dt, end-diastolic pressure and volume, end-systolic pressure and volume, relaxation constant Tau, among others) using an appropriate PVL analysis software. Further statistical analysis and graphical representations can be performed with standard analysis software.\nAnalysis of preload independent parameters\n\tNOTE: For this step it is crucial to standardize the procedure.\n\t\nSelect the first 5-6 PVLs showing decreasing preload throughout all measurements for the analysis of preload independent parameters (Figure 2D). A constant number of PVLs selected for analysis during preload reduction will decrease the variability among measurements of the obtained parameters.\nCalculate the mean value of the two measurements on each step of the protocol.\nSubscription Required.
