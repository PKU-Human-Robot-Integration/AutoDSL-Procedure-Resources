    "1. Stem Cell Maintenance\nNOTE: The cell maintenance protocol described below applies to pluipotent stem cells (PSCs) maintained in an adherent monolayer. Media, other reagents, and cell culture plates used prior to DMSO treatment can be adjusted as needed. For all the following protocols in this manuscript, cells should be handled under a biological safety cabinet.\nCoat sterile, 6 well, tissue culture-treated plates with a pluripotent stem cell-qualified matrix or substrate prepared per the manufacturer’s instructions and incubate for at least 1 h in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2, humid atmosphere). Coated plates can be film wrapped and stored at 4 °C for up to one week.\nThaw the cryopreserved PSCs in a 37 °C water bath. Sterilize vial with ethanol prior to introduction to the biological safety cabinet, then immediately transfer the cells by pipetting to a sterile conical tube containing 5-10 volumes of prewarmed stem cell media.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT).\nAspirate the media and gently resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of stem cell media supplemented with a 10 µM ROCK inhibitor, such as Y-27632.\nAspirate the culture matrix from the plate and seed the cells at the desired density, typically 0.5-1 x 106 cells per well in at least 2 mL of stem cell media per well.\nNOTE: The plating density can vary across different cell lines, and clones and should be optimized accordingly.\nMaintain the cells by replacing with prewarmed stem cell media daily. Split the cells at roughly 70%-80% confluency or when the cell colonies begin to make contact.\nFor splitting cells, aspirate the media and wash the cells once with sterile PBS. Incubate the cells with 1 mL of a dissociation enzyme solution per well for 5-10 minutes at 37 °C.",
    "Wash and resuspend the cells with prewarmed stem cell media and transfer to a sterile conical tube with 5-10 volumes of stem cell media. Follow steps 1.3-1.7 to plate the cells.\n2. DMSO Pretreatment\nNOTE: When plating the cells for DMSO pretreatment prior to differentiation, the starting plating cell density should be optimized with consideration of the typical growth rate of the stem cell line as well as the differentiation protocol being used. Validate pluripotency using conventional markers, as necessary. Cells should be passaged at least 1x-2x after initial thawing prior to differentiation.\n2D culture differentiation\nWhen the cells reach an appropriate confluency, prepare coated plates, dissociate the cells, and prepare a single-cell suspension as described above.\nCount the live cells using a hemocytometer or automatic cell counter including trypan blue or another viability marker.\nPlate the cells onto a coated 6 well plate at 0.5-1 x 106 cells per well in stem cell media with the 10 µM ROCK inhibitor.\nNOTE: For the cell lines tested in our laboratory, these densities typically resulted in 80%-90% confluent cells within the 24 h DMSO pretreatment.\nAllow cells to incubate for 24 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2, humid atmosphere).\nPrepare 1%-2% DMSO in prewarmed stem cell media (e.g., 100 µL of DMSO in 10 mL of media = 1% DMSO solution, or 200 µL DMSO in 10 mL of media = 2% DMSO solution).\nAfter 24 h incubation, aspirate the media from cells and replace it with DMSO solution.\nAllow the cells to incubate for 24 h to 48 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2, humid atmosphere) prior to differentiation.",
    "NOTE: Typically, a 24 h DMSO treatment is sufficient across a majority of human ESC and iPSC lines. Cell lines with very slow growth rates (long doubling times) can benefit from the 48 h incubation with DMSO. For a 48 h incubation with DMSO, media can be replaced with fresh stem cell media with 1%-2% DMSO after the first 24 h of treatment.\n3D culture differentiation:\nWhen the cells reach an appropriate confluency, dissociate and collect the cells in a cell suspension as described above.\nCount the live cells using a hemocytometer or automatic cell counter including a viability marker.\nPlate the cells in an uncoated, low-attachment 6 well plate at 0.5-1 x 106 cells per well in stem cell media with 10 µM ROCK inhibitor.\nNOTE: For the cell lines tested in our laboratory, these densities typically resulted in 3D hPSC sphere formation within 24 h of setting cells.\nAllow cells to incubate for 24 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator (5% CO2, humid atmosphere).\nPrepare 1%-2% DMSO in prewarmed stem cell media (e.g., 100 µL of DMSO in 10 mL of media = 1% DMSO solution, or 200 µL of DMSO in 10 mL of media = 2% DMSO solution).\nReplace the media following standard procedures (e.g., tilt the plate at a 30°-45° angle to allow cell spheres to settle at the bottom of the well; transfer cells to a sterile conical tube and allow cell spheres to settle at the bottom of the tube; or gently collect cells in suspension using a 5 or 10 mL pipette into a sterile conical tube and centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 5 min at RT).\nAspirate the media from cells and replace it with DMSO solution, pipetting gently.",
