  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: This protocol requires aliquots of at least 50 µL, with a concentration of 50 µg/mL for each Aβ peptide, as starting material. The Aβ peptides should be dissolved in 20% acetonitrile (ACN) and 4% concentrated ammonia solution in deionized water (v/v) and stored at 80 °C.\nCaution: See Table 1 for safety information.\n1. Preparation of the Solutions\nPrepare 100 mL of 20% ACN and 4% concentrated ammonia solution in deionized water (v/v) by diluting 20 mL of ACN and 4 mL of concentrated ammonia (~25%) in deionized water. Adjust the final volume to 100 mL with deionized water. Make fresh daily.\nPrepare 50 mL of 5 M guanidine-hydrochloride by dissolving 26.08 g of guanidine-hydrochloride in deionized water to a final volume of 50 mL. Store at 20 °C and make fresh monthly.\nPrepare 200 mL of 4% phosphoric acid in deionized water (v/v) by diluting 9.4 mL of concentrated phosphoric acid (~85%) in deionized water. Adjust the final volume to 200 mL with deionized water. Store in the refrigerator and make fresh weekly.\nPrepare 50 mL of 75% ACN and 10% concentrated ammonia solution (v/v) in deionized water by diluting 37.5 mL of ACN and 5 mL of concentrated ammonia (~25%) in deionized water. Adjust the final volume to 50 mL with deionized water. Make fresh daily.\nThaw at least 2.5 mL of human CSF for the calibrators, obtained from de-identified leftover samples from routine clinical analysis.\nPrepare artificial CSF containing 150 mM Na, 3.0 mM K, 1.4 mM Ca, 0.8 mM Mg, 1.0 mM P, and 155 mM Cl in deionized water and add bovine serum albumin to a final concentration of 4 mg/mL. Only 1 mL is needed per analysis, but prepare a large volume, aliquot it, and store for future use.",
    "2. Preparation of the Calibrators\nPrepare 0.5 mL of 4 µg/mL 15N-Aβ1-42 peptide by adding 40 µL of 50 µg/mL 15NAβ142 to 0.46 mL of 20% ACN and 4% concentrated ammonia in a 0.5-mL microcentrifuge tube. Mix on a vortex mixer for 1 min.\nPrepare 2 mL of 100 ng/mL 15N-Aβ1-42 peptide by adding 50 µL of the 4 µg/mL 15NAβ142 to 1.95 mL of 20% ACN and 4% concentrated ammonia in a 2-mL microcentrifuge tube. Mix on a vortex mixer for 1 min.\nPrepare six calibrator solutions (A-F) by mixing the volumes of each solution indicated in Table 2. Use 0.5, 1.5, and 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes. Mix on a vortex mixer for 1 min.\nPrepare the final calibrators (in duplicate) in 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tubes by adding the corresponding calibration solutions and human CSF according to Table 3. Mix on a vortex mixer for 1 min.\n3. Preparation of the Internal Standard\nPrepare 2 mL of 0.8 µg/mL 13C-Aβ1-42 peptide by adding 32 µL of 50 µg/mL 13CAβ142 to 1.968 mL of 20% ACN and 4% concentrated ammonia in a 2-mL microcentrifuge tube. Mix on a vortex mixer for 1 min.\nPrepare 5 mL of 16 ng/mL 13C-Aβ1-42 peptide by adding 0.1 mL of 0.8 µg/mL to 4.9 mL of 20% ACN and 4% concentrated ammonia in a 5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Mix on a vortex mixer for 1 min.\n4. Preparation of the Response Factor Sample\nNOTE: The response factor (RF) determination is performed to determine the concentration of the labeled peptide used for calibration (15N-Aβ1-42). This requires that the concentration of the native Aβ1-42 peptide has been determined using amino acid analysis (AAA). Thus, the volume and concentration of native Aβ1-42 peptide aliquots need to fulfill the requirements of the AAA.",
    "Prepare 0.5 mL of 4 µg/mL native (unlabeled)Aβ1-42 by adding 40 µL of 50 µg/mL native Aβ1-42 to 0.46 mL of 20% ACN and 4% concentrated ammonia in a 0.5-mL microcentrifuge tube. Mix on a vortex mixer for 1 min.\nPrepare a 2-mL 40 ng/mL mix of native and 15N-Aβ1-42 by adding 20 µL of 4 µg/mL native Aβ1-42 and 20 µL of 4µg/mL 15N-Aβ1-42 to 1.96 mL of 20% ACN and 4% concentrated ammonia in a 2 mL microcentrifuge tube. Mix on a vortex mixer for 1 min.\nAdd 20 µL of the 40 ng/mL mix to 0.38 mL of artificial CSF in a 0.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Prepare duplicates and mix on a vortex mixer for 1 min.\n5. Sample Preparation\nNOTE: Thaw the samples to be measured at room temperature on a roller.\nAdd 0.18 mL of each calibrator, response factor, and unknown sample (including quality control [QC] samples, if used) to a 1 mL protein 96-deep-well plate, according to Figure 1 (assuming a full plate is used). Make sure to add the samples in, or close to, the bottom of the wells.\nAdd 20 µL of internal standard to each well (i.e., calibrators, response factors, QCs, and unknowns); it is crucial to release the drop on the side of the well close to the surface of the sample without submerging the pipette tip.\nAdd 0.2 mL of 5 M guanidine-hydrochloride to each well.\nPlace the sample plate on a microplate shaker and mix the samples for 45 min at 1,100 rpm. The optimal frequency might differ depending on instrumentation. Set the frequency and amplitude of the mixer so that the solutions are thoroughly mixed and no drops of internal standard or CSF are left unmixed on the side of the wells.",
    "Add 0.2 mL of 4% phosphoric acid to each well. Vortex mix briefly.\n6. Solid Phase Extraction\nNOTE: In all washing, loading, and elution steps, apply the lowest possible vacuum after adding the solution and gradually increase as needed to load or elute the solution. Disable the vacuum between each loading and elution step.\nPut a reservoir tray for waste under a mixed-mode, cation-exchange, 96-well solid phase extraction (SPE) plate in the extraction plate manifold chamber.\nCondition the SPE sorbent by adding 0.2 mL of methanol to each well.\nEquilibrate the sorbent by adding 0.2 mL of 4% phosphoric acid to each well.\nTransfer all samples (about 0.62 mL in each well) from the deep-well plate to the SPE plate. Use an eight-channel pipette when transferring the samples from the deep-well plate to the SPE plate; it is not crucial to transfer the entire or equal volumes of all samples, since the samples contain an internal standard that will compensate for variations.\nWash the sorbent after the samples have passed through by adding 0.2 mL of 4% phosphoric acid to each well.\nAfter the washing solvent has eluted from the sorbent, replace the reservoir tray with a collection plate or tubes.\nElute the sample from the sorbent by twice adding 50 µL of 75% ACN/10% concentrated ammonia, and note that this solution requires a very low vacuum to pass through the sorbent. Remember to disable the vacuum between each addition.\n\t\nOPTIONAL: Seal the collection plate or tubes and freeze them at -80 °C. Remove the seal from the collection plate or tubes before proceeding to step 6.8.2.\nDry the eluates by using vacuum centrifugation (without applying heat); this can take from one to several hours, depending on the vacuum centrifuge.\nSeal the containers and freeze them at -80 °C.",
    "7. Liquid Chromatography\nPrepare mobile phase A (5% ACN and 0.3% concentrated ammonia in deionized water [v/v]), B (4% deionized water and 0.1% concentrated ammonia in ACN [v/v]), and needle wash (50% ACN and 4% concentrated ammonia in deionized water [v/v]).\nFor 500 mL of mobile phase A, add 25 mL of ACN and 1.5 mL of concentrated ammonia to deionized water. Adjust the final volume to 500 mL with deionized water.\nFor 500 mL of mobile phase B, add 500 µL of concentrated ammonia and 25 mL of deionized water to ACN. Adjust the final volume to 500 mL with ACN.\nPrepare 250 mL of needle wash by adding 120 mL of ACN and 10 mL of concentrated ammonia to deionized water. Adjust the final volume to 250 mL with deionized water.\nPut the mobile phases A and B and needle wash bottles open in a sonication bath for 20 min before use with the LC system\nDissolve each sample with 25 µL of 20% ACN and 4% concentrated ammonia solution and place them on a shaker for 20 min. Centrifuge down the samples and place them in the autosampler (keep at 7 °C).\nInject 20 µL of sample on a 1 x 250 mm2 polystyrene-divinylbenzene (reversed-phase) monolithic column maintained at 50 °C.\nUse the LC gradient shown in Table 4 with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Divert the first two and the last five min to waste (post-column) using a divert valve to reduce the contamination of the mass spectrometer.\n8. Mass Spectrometric Analysis\nNOTE: These parameters were used for a quadrupole-orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer equipped with aheated electrospray ionization source.\nSet the parameters for the ion source according to Table 5.",
    "Set the MS instrument to isolate the 4+ charge states of native Aβ1-42 (1,129.48 mass-to-charge ratio [m/z]), 15N-Aβ1-42 (1,143.00 m/z), and 13C-Aβ1-42 (1,179.50 m/z) in the quadrupole mass analyzer with an isolation width of 2.5 m/z.\nFragment the isolated peptides in the collision cell with a normalized collision energy (NCE) of 17.0. This might need to be tuned for each instrument, even of the same type (and especially if using other types of instruments, such as a triple quadrupole MS).\nRecord the fragment spectra with a resolution of 17.500, with an automatic gain control target of 2 x 105 charges and a maximum injection time of 250 ms.\n9. Data Processing\nUse the sum of the product ions (with a mass tolerance of ± 250 milli mass units [mmu]) in Table 6 to calculate the chromatographic areas for each peptide. Note that the ion types and numbers are only shown for native Aβ1-42 product ions, since they are the same for both 15N-Aβ1-42 and 13C-Aβ1-42.\nDetermine the average response factor of the two response factor samples by dividing the area under the curve (chromatographic peak) of 15N-Aβ1-42 with the area under the curve of native Aβ1-42.\nAdjust the concentration of the 15N-Aβ1-42 used for calibration by multiplying it with the response factor calculated in step 9.2.\nConstruct a calibration curve by plotting the area ratios of 15N-Aβ1-42 to 13C-Aβ1-42 from the two sets of calibrators against the concentration.\nCalculate the slope and intercept of the calibration curve using linear regression.\nCalculate the area ratio of native Aβ1-42 to the internal standard (13C-Aβ1-42) for unknown samples.\nExtrapolate the concentration of unknown samples from the calibration curve using the slope and intercept obtained in step 9.5.\nSubscription Required.
