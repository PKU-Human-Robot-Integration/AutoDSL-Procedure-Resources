    "Sample preparation is one of the most critical steps of the MAM approach. The development of a robust and reproducible sample preparation protocol with minimal sample preparation-induced artificial protein modifications is key to design a robust and reliable MAM workflow. Manual sample preparation has been extensively used, although to date there is no consensus on the protocol and different reagents and buffers that are used in this regard. Conventionally, it requires the researcher to denature, reduce, and alkylate the sample followed by a desalting step or buffer exchange into the digestion buffer prior to enzymatic digestion. Overall, trypsin is the most used protease for peptide mapping on mAbs. However, certain more complex mAbs or other biotherapeutic modalities might require other enzymes to achieve full sequence coverage and a reliable PTMs assessment.\nMaterials\nInfliximab RP, commercial chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody drug product (FDA UNII registry: 4F4 × 42SYQ6)\nInfliximab biosimilars, commercial chimeric IgG1 biosimilars Flixabi, Inflectra and Zessly (Evidentic GmbH; Flixabi batch no.

Wear personal protective equipment when handling.\n1. Adjust the sample (infliximab RP, biosimilars or NISTmAb) concentration to 1 mg/ml by diluting with guanidine-Tris buffer. Place 10 µl of sample (10 mg/ml) into a polypropylene 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and add 90 µl of guanidine-Tris buffer.\nInitial sample concentration should be at least 10 mg/ml because lower concentrations would require the use of a larger volume of sample, which would dilute down the buffer composition. All dilutions are carried out in a 0.5-ml low protein binding polypropylene microcentrifuge tube to minimize protein loss. If different types of samples are being used, a total protein amount between 50 and 100 µg as a starting material is an acceptable range.\n2. Add 2.0 µl of 500 mM DTT and mix by pipetting, yielding a final concentration of ∼10 mM DTT. Incubate the reduction reaction for 30 min at room temperature.\nTo minimize protein loss, polypropylene Eppendorf LoBind microcentrifuge tubes are recommended.\n3. Add 4.0 µl of 500 mM IAC and mix by pipetting to give a final concentration of 20 mM IAC. Store the solution in the absence of light for 20 min at room temperature. Arrest alkylation by adding a further 4.0 µl of 50 mM DTT, resulting in a total volume of 110 µl (11 mM DTT).\nThis step is light sensitive.\n4. Perform buffer exchange by using Bio-Spin P-6 gel column(s) as follows:",
    "Break off the tip and place the column in a 2-ml Eppendorf microcentrifuge tube.\nAfter removing the cap, centrifuge the column for 2 min at 1000 × g, 4°C.\nDispose of the liquid collected in the Eppendorf tube and carefully add 500 µl of 50 mM Tris at pH 7.9 to the top of the BioSpin-6 column.\nRepeat centrifugation for 2 min at 1000 × g, 4°C. Discard the collected liquid.\nRepeat this centrifugation step three more times (four times in total) to completely buffer-exchange the BioSpin-6 column.\nBefore sample preparation, invert the BioSpin-6 columns vigorously several times and allow them to equilibrate at room temperature for 30 min. To save time, prepare the buffer cartridges during the 20 min resting period of the sample during the alkylation (step 3).\n5. Place the spin column in a new 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube and carefully add 110 µl of the alkylated sample to the center of the column bed. Centrifuge the column for 4 min at 1000 × g, 4°C, and collect the eluate.\nThe collected sample is ready for trypsin digestion.\n6. Perform trypsin digestion as follows:\n         \nAdd 100 µl of LC-MS-grade water to a vial of 100 µg of trypsin to give a final concentration of 1 mg/ml.\nMix the solution by gentle vortexing.\nAdd this solution at a 1:10 ratio to the protein sample above (e.g., 10 µl of 1 mg/ml trypsin to 100 µl of sample solution).\nPlace the resulting solution in an Eppendorf ThermoMixer and heat at 37°C for 30 min.\nStop digestion by adding 10% formic acid (1:10 ratio in volume with the digestion solution).\nVerify that the pH is acidic (pH ∼1.5) using a pH meter.\nTransfer the final sample solution to low-binding chromatography glass vials with inserts.",
    "7. Place the sample vials in the sample rack held at 5°C for analysis.\nThe sample can be kept at −20°C or lower until analysis, if needed.",
    "As an alternative, an optimized workflow using automated trypsin digestion is also described in this protocol as developed by Millán-Martín et al. (2020[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.927#cpz1927-bib-0018]). Automation of sample preparation using trypsin magnetic beads allows for high-throughput and improves robustness and consistency. The benefits of automated immobilized enzyme digestion are increased workflow efficiency and simplicity, and reduced sample handling and time needed for sample preparation. Briefly, by using this approach, the protein is unfolded by using heat denaturation; the digestion is performed with a heat-resistant trypsin on a magnetic robotic platform for 30 min at 70°C with the use of MES buffer at pH 6.5. Subsequently, Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP), a reducing agent that is active at reduced pH, is added and significantly improves the digestion efficiency, removing the need for an additional reduction step. The addition of TCEP as a reducing agent without the need for detergents and any further alkylation step also simplifies sample preparation and allows for full, or almost full, sequence coverage.\nAdditional Materials (also see Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.927#cpz1927-prot-0001])\nSMART Digest trypsin kit, magnetic bulk resin option, low pH (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 60109-101-MB-LPH)\nH2O, Milli-Q\nTCEP Bond-Breaker solution neutral pH (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 77720)\n10% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) (see recipe)\n96-well plate, KF deep-well (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 95040450)\n12-tip comb, KF Duo (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 97003500)\nPurification system, KingFisher (KF) Duo Prime (Thermo Scientific, cat. no. 5400110)\nBindIt software version 4.0 (Thermo Scientific)\nCAUTION: TCEP and TFA cause severe skin burns and eye damage.

    "1. Dilute sample (infliximab RP and biosimilars) by adding 150 µl of SMART Digest buffer to the 50 µl sample (previously diluted if needed, to contain 100 µg of protein). Mix the solution by gentle vortexing and add to row A of a 96-well plate.\n2. Prepare wash buffer by adding 50 µl of SMART digest buffer to 150 µl of Milli-Q water in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. Mix the solution by vortexing and add to row E of the 96-well plate.\n3. Prepare magnetic bulk trypsin resin by adding 15 µl of magnetic trypsin beads to 100 µl of SMART digest buffer. Mix the bead solution first by aspiration and then by gentle vortexing. Add the mixed bead solution to row D of the 96-well plate.\nBefore mixing magnetic beads with SMART Digest buffer, thaw the bead solution to room temperature for ∼20 min. The bulk mixture will separate from the solution that the beads are in during thawing; therefore, it is vital that the beads are vortexed thoroughly beforehand.\n4. Place the 12-tip comb in row B of the 96-well plate and add this plate to the KF Duo Prime purification system.\n5. In each well containing sample in row A, add 2 µl of TCEP to the 198 µl of solution to give a final concentration of 5 mM TCEP.\nBecause lane A contains the samples to be digested, the plate must be inserted with row A sitting on the temperature block.\n6. Begin the digestion by pressing start on the software.",
    "Briefly, the robot program moves the magnetic rods to row B to protect the rods with the tip comb. Rods are moved to row D, and magnetic beads are transferred to row E for a wash step. From row E, beads are moved to the sample-containing wells in row A. As row A is placed on a heating block, the temperature is brought to 70°C, and digestion is started. During the digestion, magnetic rods are demagnetized, and they shake the solution by repetitive immersion in the well. After 30 min, magnetic rods are activated again, and the beads are collected and moved to the waste row (F).\n7. Quench after digestion by removing the 96-well deep-well plate from the KF Duo Prime purification system. Add 1 µl of 10% TFA to row A for a final concentration of 0.1% (v/v) TFA. Transfer the final sample solution in row A to a low-binding chromatography glass vial with inserts.\nIf post-digestion cooling is not present in the BindIt method, the plate can be hot to touch. Take care when removing the plate to avoid the metal heating block and prevent burning of the skin.\n8. Place the sample vials in the sample rack kept at 5°C.\nSamples can be kept at −20°C until analysis, if needed.\nThe values listed above are for each sample; if 12 samples are prepared at the same time, the same amount would be needed for each of the 12 wells. The automated sample purification system can digest a maximum of 12 samples in one plate. For larger quantities of samples, additional KF systems are available to allow for digestion of up to 96 samples, such as the KF Flex system, which allows handling up to 24 to 96 samples per run.",
    "After digestion, samples are transferred to chromatography low-binding vials for subsequent RPLC-MS analysis. In this protocol, we describe the RPLC-HRAM MS MAM workflow developed on a Vanquish Flex binary UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Orbitrap Exploris 240 mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) for the MAM discovery phase thus including MS/MS acquisition, or Orbitrap Exploris MX mass detector (Thermo Scientific) with full MS only acquisition for the MAM monitoring phase. Before the analysis of the digested peptides, the LC-MS system was evaluated for optimum performance by using a system performance evaluation test (SET), which consisted of a commercially available bovine serum albumin (BSA) tryptic digest standard. This step is designed to be run during installation and troubleshooting following instrument vendor recommendations. Additionally, sample preparation quality and LC-MS system performance must also be monitored throughout the experiment. To address this, a system check known as system suitability test (SST) is included within each sequence of analysis. NIST monoclonal antibody reference material is used in the present work, but it is not limited to that, and any other well-characterized molecule within each laboratory could also be used.\nIt is important to highlight that other instrumentation can be used from other vendors; however, the performance of the method outlined can be guaranteed only on an equivalent instrument platform.\nMaterials\nFlexMix calibration solution (Thermo Scientific, cat. no.

A full system calibration is typically carried out once a month.\n2. Equilibrate the column as follows:\n         \nAdd solvent lines to their corresponding solvent bottles and flush the system at 50% A (0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water) and 50% B (0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile) by opening the purge valve.\nClose the purge valve, connect the column, and bring it slowly to the operational flow rate in 0.050 ml min−1 intervals.\nContinue until the column pressure is stabilized (within a fluctuation of ±1 bar), which takes ∼30 min.\n3.

The sequence should include replicates of the reference sample, blanks, a reference molecule for system suitability monitoring along the sequence and the sample set under investigation (e.g., stress study, newly produced batch, and biosimilar comparison).\nIt is important to ensure that acquisition does not exceed 72 hr to prevent ion transfer tube blockage and to allow for mass calibration to be performed. Consequently, sequences should be kept to a maximum length of 36 injections. If the system gets too dirty, or to extend the acquisition time, the use of a divert valve is recommended. This will require an adjustment to the gradient to maintain isocratic conditions for 1 min at the start of the analysis. In general, good instrument maintenance and housekeeping are recommended, together with the use of high-quality solvents also when the instrument is used for a different analysis.",
    "The SST should contain a general system check and a special system check; the first evaluates retention time and peak area precision, peak width and peak height and mass accuracy, while the second focuses on monitoring some PTM levels to ensure consistency across all the analyses within or between days, operators, etc. NPD analysis is also performed to ensure no contaminants are present in the system rather than the sample. Table 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.927#cpz1927-tbl-0003] summarizes the SST-monitored peptides, evaluated parameters and acceptance criteria defined for the NIST monoclonal antibody tryptic digestion used. An example of SST extracted ion chromatogram plot showing the location of the NISTmAb reference peptides is shown in Figure 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.927#cpz1927-fig-0002].\nFigure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.927#cpz1927-fig-0003] shows the total ion chromatogram (TIC) and selected ion chromatograms (SICs) of DTLMISR peptide from the heavy chain in the unmodified and oxidized forms respectively for infliximab RP after RPLC-HRAMS MS analysis using the settings described in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.927#cpz1927-tbl-0002]. As it can be observed, oxidation impacts the retention time behavior of the peptides by reducing the retention time based on reversed-phase chromatography. Confident identification is possible also based on MS/MS data analysis searched using the originator sequence, with parameters set to allow for amino acid substitutions.\nTable 3.\n                SST Monitored Peptides, Evaluated Parameters and Acceptance Criteriaa[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.927#cpz1927-tbl3-note-0001_64]\ntable:\n﻿Evaluated parameters,Acceptance criteria\nList of peptides for general check,EEQYN[A2G0F]STYR; EEQYN[A2G1F]STYR; HYNPSLK; ALPAPIEK; LLIYDTSK; NQVSLTCLVK; TTPPVLDSDG; SFFLYSK; VVSVLTVLHQDWLNGK ALEWLADIWWDDKK\nRT % CV,≤2%\nPeak area % CV,≤10%\nPeak width at 10% height,≤10 s\nPeak width at 10% height % CV,≤10%\n\"Peak height (min, max)\",Min ≥1.0 × 107 counts Max ≤7.0 × 109 counts\nComposite scoring,Confirmed\nMass accuracy,≤5 ppm (absolute)\nList of peptides for special system check,DTLM[oxidation]ISR; SLSLSPG[Lys]; EEQYN[A2G0F]STYR; EEQYN[A2G1F]STYR\n% Oxidation,≤3%\n% Oxidation % CV,≤10%\n% C-term Lys,Between 13%-18%\n% C-term Lys % CV,≤10%\n% EEQYN[A2G0F]STYR % EEQYN[A2G1F]STYR,Between 35%-45% Between 35%-45%",

    "The final stage of the MAM approach is the data processing stage, which is also divided into two phases. During Phase I of MAM, evaluation of protein sequence coverage, assessment of most relevant quality attributes and peptide workbook creation are performed. During Phase II of MAM, targeted monitoring of predefined product attributes and non-targeted MS (NTMS) processing or new peak detection (NPD) are attained, to investigate the presence of product- and process-related impurities or any other difference with noticeable inter-sample difference (e.g., potential sequence variants or differences in any quality attribute). The NPD function is a comparative analysis that uses a base peak alignment algorithm to determine any non-monitored differences between the LC-MS chromatogram of a test sample and that of a reference standard. The reporting of the obtained results is also included in this phase. Default report templates are included within the data processing software, which would be implemented by the user by means of including tables with the analytical conditions, data processing parameters, table results and plots of interests. Once the report is custom designed and created by the user this can be saved and used for future analysis.\nIn this protocol, server-based software is used to perform data processing and reporting. The server integrates all the instrument platforms available in the lab, together with all the software platforms used for data acquisition and data processing. The server-based software includes features, e.g., seamless workflow between various applications at the platform level, standardized accessibility to algorithms, data and results, and customizable reporting engines and dashboards.\nSupplementary Data 1 (see Supporting Information) provides screenshots with a walk-through of all the steps described in this section.\nMaterials\nThermo Scientific Chromeleon CDS software version 7.3.1 or equivalent\nThermo Scientific BioPharma Finder software version 5.1 or equivalent",

Introduce the protein sequence and all the information needed for the analysis by selecting the ‘Sequence Manager’ option. Fixed and/or variable modifications, type of protein glycosylation and maximum number of allowed modifications per peptide must be defined.\nMost-common searching parameters for IgG1-type monoclonal antibodies include a list of variable modifications for the N-terminal (e.g., pyroglutamate formation), C-terminal (e.g., lysine content or glycine loss followed by proline amidation) and the side chain (deamidation, oxidation, glycation, succinimide formation or water loss).",
    "The more accurate information provided to the software about protein sequence and the modifications it may carry, the greater is the confidence in the validity of the processed data. Special attention must be paid to the type of sample preparation, i.e., to set up carboxymethylation as a fixed modification to all cysteine residues if alkylation is performed by using IAC. Alternatively, iodoacetamide (IAA) can be used but carbamidomethylation should be selected instead as fixed modification for all cysteine residues.\n5.

View the results for peptide mapping analysis: sequence coverage. \n         \nAfter the application completes the analysis of an experiment, you can open the results by selecting the experiment and clicking ‘Load Results’ from the top pane within ‘BPF results’ folder.\nThe ‘Process and Review’ page opens and displays the different types of chromatograms (BPC-Base peak chromatogram, SIC-Single ion chromatogram or TIC-Total ion chromatogram), trend plots, protein sequence, full and MS/MS spectra, the results table, and the real-time optimization pane. The latter allows users to change any of the method or sequence parameters and reprocess the data in real-time again.\nFilter the results table as summarized in Table 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.927#cpz1927-tbl-0005] to exclude peptides containing sodium or potassium adducts, as well as those that correspond to nonspecific protease activity, gas phase generated ions or unspecified modifications, and to consider peptides with up to only one missed cleavage. Custom defined filters can be saved for future use as *.cfg file format to be applied to another data set.\nThe resulting component list must be selected to include all the filtered peptides in the sequence coverage map. To view the coverage map, select the ‘Mapping’ tab. By default, the application opens the ‘Coverage’ page, which displays the color-coded chromatogram, the sequence coverage map, and the results.",
    "An example of a sequence coverage map of infliximab RP obtained using in-solution tryptic digestion is shown in Figure 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.927#cpz1927-fig-0004]. Full or almost full sequence coverage is attained for light chain (LC) and heavy chain (HC) respectively. The only missing peptide for the LC is EAK, and it is not shown as it can only be detected by full MS and the resulting confidence score is equal to zero, thus it is excluded as does not follow the applied filter rules stated in Table 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.927#cpz1927-tbl-0005].\nPeptide mapping results can be saved in the centralized storage in a report format or downloaded as a pdf or excel file.\nTable 5.\n                Filters Applied to the Results Table for mAb Peptide Mapping Experiment\ntable:\n﻿Field,Operator,Operand,Comment\nModification,Does not contain,+,To exclude adducts\n,Does not contain,Nonspecific,To exclude nonspecific generated peptides (those that do not follow protease rules)\n,Does not contain,Gas phase,To exclude gas phase ions\n,Does not contain,.,To exclude unknown modifications\nDelta (ppm),≥,−5,To include all the peptides within ± 5 ppm accuracy\n,≤,5,\nConfidence score,≥,95,Experimental MS2 spectrum match with the theoretical spectrum\nMissed cleavages,≤,1,To include peptides with up 1 missed cleavage\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c21807c4-5bff-4b3a-a5dc-af0fb7c04dd1/cpz1927-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nSequence coverage map of infliximab RP obtained using in-solution tryptic digestion.

Create target peptide workbook:\n         \na.Navigate to the ‘Modification Summary’ within the ‘Mapping’ tab.",
    "For each modification, the selection of the component included for the calculation of modification percentage abundance is semi-automated, because components are also filtered following the rules specified in Table 5[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.927#cpz1927-tbl-0005]. For IgG1 type monoclonal antibodies, when evaluating N-glycans, the peptide TKPREEQYNSTYR, although containing two missed cleavages, was also included in the component list because of its significant abundance and its harboring of the Fc N-glycans.\nb.Once the components to compute the relative quantitation are selected, right-click anywhere in the components table and choose ‘save as peptide workbook’ → checked.\nc.Save the peptide workbook within the specific folder in the server-based repository. Peptide workbook can be edited any time when needed and it can be overwritten or appended to an existing one.\n8. Choose the PQAs/CQAs that are relevant for your protein. The PQAs/CQAs chosen for relative quantitation in this study are glycosylation, deamidation, isomerization, succinimide formation, oxidation, C-terminal lysine content and N-terminal pyroglutamate formation with relative abundances ≥ 0.1%.\nAll detected charge states for unmodified and modified peptides must be included in the peptide workbook. It is also important to visually check the selected ion chromatograms for all selected components to be sure that peak integration is correct. If necessary, BioPharma Finder applications enable manual integration. For each PQA/CQA, select four isotopes of all the identified charge states by entering ‘4’ in the number of isotopes per peptide box.\nExperiments, reports and created peptide workbooks are automatically saved in the virtual private server or dedicated data storage. The review of the results generated will automatically generate a new version to record the changes that will be accessible to the user or users anytime. The dynamic versioning feature allows for local and global collaboration when multiple users or laboratories are involved, as all the results are securely saved in one location.",
    "9. Export the target peptide workbook. To export the target peptide workbook, click ‘Export’ at the top-right corner above the list of target peptide workbooks.

Open Chromeleon CDS by double clicking the Chromeleon icon to open the home page window:\n         \na.Create a new processing method within the Chromeleon console, by clicking ‘Create’ → ‘Processing method’ from the top panel.\nb.When creating a processing method, you can choose from several predefined method templates.\nFor this study, the MS quantitative processing method layout template is used and edited accordingly. Method parameters used for the relative PQA/CQA quantitation are summarized in Table 6[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.927#cpz1927-tbl-0006].\nc.Once the new method is created and renamed, import the target peptide workbook generated during the previous step into the MS Component Table of the processing method editor by clicking ‘Import’ and selecting the workbook path.\nd.The imported peptide data contains the list of components, RT, charge state, precursor mass and four isotopes used for MS quantitation and confirmation.\nYou must create a processing method before importing the peptide workbook in the Chromeleon CDS.\nTable 6.\n                Chromeleon CDS MS Processing Method Parameter Settings for Target PQAs/CQAs Monitoring and Relative Quantitation\ntable:\n﻿MS detection,Setting\nExtracted ion chromatogram,MS default detection settings\nDetection algorithm,ICIS\nArea noise factor,5\nPeak noise factor,10\nBaseline window,80\nNoise method,INCOS\nMin peak width,3\nMultiple resolution,10\nArea tail extension,5\nArea scan window,0\nMS component table,Setting\nTable S1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.927#support-information-section] (see Supporting Information),.wbpf workbook from BPF\nMS settings,Settings\nMS spectra bunching,—\nPeak spectrum bunch,Width 1 (spectra)\nBaseline correction,No\nMS noise reduction,Do not reduce noise\nMS chromatogram settings,—\nMass precision,4 decimal places\nMass tolerance (manually defined),5.0 ppm\nPeptide table,Settings\nImported from BPF software 5.1 peptide workbook,—\nComposite scoring,Settings\nPass score if at least,2 criteria passed",

View detected components from the MS data and adjust processing parameters to achieve consistent peak detection and integration:\n         \nIn the Chromeleon console, click ‘Studio,’ then click ‘Data Processing’ and select ‘Processing Method,’ ‘MS Components’ and ‘Mass Spectra’ in the top pane group. The MS components pane appears next to the mass spectra at the top, while processing method parameters are shown at the bottom by default.\nIn the ‘MS component table’ tab within the processing method table, select each of the components and double-click to adjust retention properties. Unmodified peptides are selected as a reference component, while for modified peptides, a time distance and a proper component match algorithm are selected.\nWindow width must also be adjusted accordingly so that any peak that must be integrated is within the selected RT window.\nIt may be necessary to adjust the MS detection settings of the processing method, and this will depend on the chromatography and the peak shape of the detected peptides. Some peaks are very sharp, whereas others, normally the ones eluting later in the chromatogram, are broader; thus, increasing the baseline window in the algorithm setting sometimes helps achieve a better integration of the broader peaks. In the present study, a value of 80 was used (50 is the default value, but this could be within 1 and 500).\n12. View the isotopic distribution chart. In the ‘Data Processing’ home, select ‘Interactive Charts’ from the top pane group. Click ‘Charts’ from the top pane → ‘All Charts’ → ‘Isotopic Distribution’ and click ‘Insert Chart.’",
    "This interactive chart shows the observed distribution of isotopes in the selected injections relative to the most abundant isotope. The chart also displays the theoretical distribution relative to the most abundant theoretical isotope, for charge state peptides. Component isotopic distribution provides confidence in the integration and can help to confirm detection of a peptide component.\nNew peak detection: non-targeted MS (NTMS) processing to monitor inter-sample differences\n13. Select NTMS New Peak Detection Algorithm. It is important to select the new peak detection algorithm for data processing once the sequence is created and the RPLC-HRAM MS analysis is performed. In the Chromeleon console select the sequence with the data, right click and go to ‘Properties’ → ‘Features.’ Select BioPharma Finder as the NTMS new peak detection algorithm.\n14. Set up NPD parameters and start NPD analysis:\n         \na.In the chromatography studio, click ‘Non-Targeted MS processing’ from the navigation panel. Define the processing method parameters according to the approach that you would like to take.\nIn the present study NPD is used for biosimilarity evaluation with the aim to detect any new or modified peaks with significant intersample differences in abundance compared to the reference product, which is previously characterize during MAM discovery phase. The parameter settings used for the NPD step in this study are outlined in Table 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.927#cpz1927-tbl-0007].\nb.Once the processing parameters are defined, click ‘Start’ from the top processing pane, if only a single injection is to be analyzed, or ‘Start All,’ to process all the injections within the sequence at a time.\nThe time required for processing a single file will depend on the parameters selected. If a low signal threshold is selected data processing will take longer.\nTable 7.\n                Chromeleon CDS New Peak Detection Settings for Biosimilars Comparison Using BioPharma Finder Algorithm\ntable:\n﻿Property,Value\nGeneral,",

View NPD results. Once the data analysis is completed ‘Component Results table,’ ‘Component Results plot’ and ‘MS plot’ will be shown.\n16. Set up Result Component filters. Results must be filtered with the aim of reducing false negatives/positives, including RT tolerance (min), m/z tolerance (ppm), m/z range, charge state and MS area ratio. The latter allows for an x-fold change, either more or less, in terms of average intensity (Table 7[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.927#cpz1927-tbl-0007]).\n17. Save the NPD processing parameters within the processing method and keep the NPD results in case they are needed in the future. The saved parameters can be modified later.\nNPD processing parameters must be adjusted for each of the approaches for which NPD is used. Any change in the processing method parameters will require the sample to be processed again, and previous results will be overwritten if they are not saved with a different processing method name.",
    "18. Identify the newly detected components. Protein identification software will be needed, as will the use of protein databases to search for the peptide identity. In the present work, BioPharma Finder software is used.\nAny potential new peptide or impurities will require the confirmatory MS/MS data for confident identification, so the initial LC-MS/MS acquired data during the MAM discovery phase will be used for the database search.\nDesign of the electronic report\n19. In the Chromeleon console, click ‘Create’ → ‘Report Template.’ A few default templates are available in the software. Select ‘Empty Template’ and then customize it by including different sheets with the results that you want to be included. To rename the template, right-click the template name and choose ‘Rename.’ The template with its new name appears in the ‘Report Templates’ section in the ‘Report Designer’ from the navigation pane.\nA typical MAM report will contain all sequence results in various worksheets showing sequence overview, PQA/CQA quantitative results, composite scoring, and new detected peak results. The electronic report designer works similarly to an Excel document. Chromeleon provides multiple options for inserting new sheets, report tables, report variables, plots, result charts and illustrations. All the different details and results will be inserted by the selection of the corresponding formulas that are within the application. It is also possible to create custom formulas.\n20. Create a sequence overview tab to summarize sequence and injection details:\n         \nDouble-click the sheet 1 tab and name it accordingly.\nManually introduce sequence details, e.g., name, instrument and processing method and then choose the formula of interest by clicking ‘Insert’ from the top panel and selecting ‘Sequence,’ ‘Injection’ or ‘Chromatogram’ from the ‘Report Variables’ group on the top panel.\nDo the same for the MS acquisition details.",
    "Select an empty cell to introduce injection details and click ‘Insert’ → ‘All Tables’ → ‘Peak Summary Table’ → ‘Table’ → ‘Sequence Overview.’ The different columns in the table can be edited by the user.\nIt is also possible to add a chromatogram view by selecting ‘Insert’ → ‘Chromatogram’ from the ‘Plots’ group on the top panel. The chromatogram view will change depending on the injection that is selected at any time.\nTo add more worksheets, select ‘Home’ from the top panel, click ‘Insert’ from the ‘Cells and Sheets’ pane on the top and then select ‘Insert Sheet.’\n21. Create PTM tabs for the different monitored attributes, e.g., oxidation, deamidation, N- and C-terminal composition and N-glycosylation:\n         \nInsert sequence details at the top of the page as described in step 20b.\nThen, click ‘Insert’ → ‘All Tables’ → ‘Peak Summary Table’ → ‘Summary Table.’ The information contained for each column must be defined by the user, but in general, injection number, injection name and peak area for the detected components could be defined.\nTo enter this information, the application contains a full list of formulas and variables that can be used by just selecting the one of interest at any time.\nTo obtain the value of the relative levels of each of the modifications to be monitored, the formula must be entered manually within a cell.\n               formula:\n$$\\begin{equation*} {\\rm{\\% \\;}}Modification = \\frac{{XIC{\\rm{\\;}}Area{\\rm{\\;}}of{\\rm{\\;}}modified{\\rm{\\;}}peptide{\\rm{\\;}}}}{{{\\rm{SUM\\;}}\\left( {XIC{\\rm{\\;}}Area{\\rm{\\;}}of{\\rm{\\;}}modified{\\rm{\\;}}peptide + XIC{\\rm{\\;}}Area{\\rm{\\;}}unmodified{\\rm{\\;}}peptide} \\right)}}\\times{\\rm{\\;}}100 \\end{equation*}$$\nTo generate a results table showing the area for each specific component, it is important to select the channel ‘MS Quantitation’ and the component of interest from the properties’ summary table. Be aware that the quantitation is based on all the detected charge states for each component using four isotopes.",
    "22. Create a non-targeted MS processing tab to summarize the NPD results in a new worksheet renamed as ‘NPD,’ insert the NTMS processing parameters table at the top of the page by clicking ‘Insert’ → ‘All Tables’ → ‘Peptide Results’ → ‘BioPharma Finder Processing Parameters Table.’ Below, in an empty cell, click ‘Insert’ → ‘All Tables’ → ‘Peptide Results’ → ‘BioPharma Finder Component Results Table.’\nTypically, the information contained in the Component Results table will show component number, RT (min), m/z, charge state, monoisotopic experimental mass, MS area ratio for the sample compared to the reference, and the MS area for both the sample and the reference.\n23. Print the report and save it as a pdf. Select ‘Page Layout’ from the top panel and define page breaks, margins, orientation and autorepeat area. Click ‘Print Preview’ to see the page configuration before generating the final pdf, which could contain all the worksheets or only the ones you would like to include at any time.\nThe MS Component and MS plots in the report template show only the plots for a specific component of the injection that is selected. To print the plots for the component across all the injections, you must set the MS Component and MS plots as an autorepeat area.\nThe generation of the electronic report in the final pdf form takes only a few minutes once the report template is designed for both the monitoring phase summary results and NPD results."
