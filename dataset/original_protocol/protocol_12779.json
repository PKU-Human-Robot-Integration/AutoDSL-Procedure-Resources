    "1. Identification and Cloning of Guide RNA Sequence\nIdentification of guide RNA sequence\nIdentify a 5’-NGG-3’ PAM sequence close to where the stop codon will be inserted. (Figure 1A) Labeled are all PAM sequences found in the first 100 base pairs of TPK2 (Figure 1A).\nNOTE: Guide sequences targeting each C. albicans open reading frame can be found at http://osf.io/ARDTX 11,12.\nIdentify the Forward Guide Primer_3 sequence, which will be the 20 bases directly upstream of a NGG PAM site and will not contain more than 5 Ts in a row. Left-click on the base directly upstream of the NGG and drag the cursor 20 bases, then left-click on the primer tab to add the primer.\nIdentify the Reverse Guide Primer_3 sequence, which will be the complement to the Forward Guide sequence.\nNOTE: Shown are guides that use PAM_3 (Figure 1B).\nRight-click the primer and select “copy primer data”. Paste the sequences into a text editing program.\nAdd overhang sequences to Forward and Reverse Guide oligos to facilitate cloning (Table 1, Figure 1B).\nAdd the nucleotide sequence ATTTG to the 5’ end of the Forward Guide Primer_3 before purchasing.\nAdd G to the 3’ end of the Forward Guide Primer_3 before purchasing.\nAdd the nucleotide sequence AAAAC to the 5’ end of the Reverse Guide Primer_3 before purchasing.\nAdd C to the 3’ end of the Reverse Guide Primer_3 before purchasing.\nDigest CaCas9 expression vector pV1524 with BsmBI.\nNOTE: pV1524 contains an ampicillin (Ampr) and nourseothricin (Natr) markers. Cas9 has been codon-optimized for C. albicans.",
    "Digest the plasmid by adding: 2 μg of pv1524, 5 μL of 10x Buffer, 1 μL of BsmBI, and H2O to 50 μL in a 1.5 mL tube. Incubate at 55 °C for 20 min. (Alternatively, digest pv1524 for 15 min with Esp3I, an isoschizomer of BsmBI, at 37 °C.)\nCool to room temperature (RT) and spin for 30 s at 2,348 x g to bring condensation to the bottom of the tube. Proceed to step 1.4 or store the digested plasmid at -20 °C.\nPhosphatase-treat the digested backbone.\nAdd 1 μL of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) to the digestion mixture and incubate at 37 °C for 1 h.\nPurify the digested plasmid using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction (PCR) purification kit (instructions provided with kit) and elute it in 30 μL of elution buffer (EB).\nPhosphorylate and anneal Forward Guide Primer_3 and Reverse Guide Primer_3.\nAdd 0.5 μL of 100 μM Forward Guide Primer_3, 0.5 μL of 100 μM Reverse Guide Primer_3, 5 μL of 10x T4 ligase buffer, 1 μL of T4 polynucleotide kinase, and 43 μL of H2O to a PCR tube.\nAdd 5 μL of 10x T4 ligase buffer, 1 μL of T4 polynucleotide kinase, and 44 μL of molecular biology-grade H2O in a second PCR tube.\nNOTE: This will serve as the negative control.\nIncubate the reaction mixtures in a thermocycler at 37 °C for 30 min, then at 95 °C for 5 min.\nCool the mixture at the slowest ramp rate to 16 °C to anneal the ,oligos. Then place the annealed oligo mixture at 4 °C.\nLigate the annealed oligos into digested pv1524 from step 1.4.3.",
    "Add the following to a PCR tube: 1 μL of 10x T4 ligase buffer, 0.5 μL of T4 DNA ligase, 0.5 μL of annealed oligo mix, digested CIP-treated purified plasmid (20–40 ng), and H2O to a 10 μL total volume.\nAdd the following to a PCR tube: 1 μL of 10x T4 ligase buffer, 0.5 μL of T4 DNA ligase, digested CIP-treated purified vector (20–40 ng), 1 μL of negative control mixture, and H2O up to a 10 μL total volume.\nIncubate both tubes in a thermocycler at 16 °C for 30 min, then at 65 °C for 10 min, then cool to 25 °C.\nTransform 5 μL of the ligation mixtures into chemically competent Escherichia coli DH5α using a standard heat shock transformation protocol. Select on LB Amp/Nat media (200 μg/mL Amp, 50 μg/mL Nat).\nNOTE: Failure to select pV1524 and its derivatives on double selection media will result in loss of Nat/CaCas9/guide module by FLP/FRT excision in bacteria.\nPurify plasmids from four transformants by miniprep, and sequence the insertion sequence with sequencing primer (Table 1).\n\tNote: Most of the time, sequencing 4 transformants is sufficient to identify at least 1 correct clone.\nSave plasmids that have the guide RNA sequence cloned a single time into the BsmBI cut site at -20 °C.\n2. Designing and Generation of Repair Template\nInsert a stop codon by left-clicking in the gene sequence and adding nucleotides that encode a stop codon and restriction digestion site (Figure 1C, Table 1).\nNOTE: The insertion will disrupt the PAM sequence.\nNOTE: A restriction digestion site will be included in the repair template sequence to facilitate efficient screening of clones (Figure 1C).",
    "Left-click 10 bases downstream of where the mutation will be made and drag the cursor 60 bases upstream. Left-click on the primer tab to add the primer. This will add Repair Template Forward_3. Left-click 10 bases upstream of where the mutation will be made and drag the cursor 60 bases downstream. Left-click on the primer tab to add the primer. This will add Repair Template Reverse 3. (Figure 1C)\nPerform primer extension to generate the repair template.\nAdd 1.2 μL of 100 μm repair template forward primer, 1.2 μL of 100 μm repair template reverse primer, 6 μL of deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) (total concentration 40 mM), 6 μL of buffer, 0.6 μL of Taq polymerase (3 units), and 45 μL of H2O to each of the 4 PCR tubes.\nPerform primer extension by running between 20 and 30 rounds of PCR. Example extension conditions: 2 min at 95 °C, (30 s at 95 °C, 1 min at 50 °C, 1 min at 68 °C) x 34, 10 min at 68 °C.\nCombine contents of all 4 PCR tubes in a 1.5 mL tube and use a PCR purification kit to purify products in 50 μL of H2O.\nQuantitate the primer extension products to ensure sufficient DNA by determining the absorbance at 260 nm.\nNOTE: Typical final concentration of the primer extension product is ~200–300 ng/µL.\n3. Transformation of C. albicans with Repair Template and Plasmid\nMake TE/lithium acetate.\nMix 10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM lithium acetate, and H2O (all stock solution pH 7.5) to achieve 50 mL total volume.\nMake PLATE\nMix 40% PEG 3350, 100 mM lithium acetate, 10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, and H2O (all stock solution pH 7.5) to achieve 50 mL total volume.\nDigest correctly-cloned plasmids from step 1.9.",
    "Add 10 μg of plasmid, 4 µL of 10x buffer, 0.4 µL of 10 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.5 µL of KpnI, 0.5 µL of SacI, and H20 to 40 µL total volume in a 1.5 mL tube. Incubate at 37 °C overnight (Figure 1D).\nGrow an overnight culture of C. albicans SC5314, wild-type prototroph, at 25 °C in yeast peptone dextrose supplemented with 0.27 mM Uridine (YPD + Uri), ideally to OD600 less than 6.\nPellet 5 OD600 units of cells per transformation by spinning for 5 min at 2,348 x g and suspend the 5 OD600 of pelleted cells in 100 µL TE/lithium acetate.\nAdd the following to a 1.5 mL tube in the order listed: 1) 100 µL of cells from step 3.4.1, 2) 40 µL of boiled and quick-cooled salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/mL), 3) 10 µg of plasmid digestion from step 3.3.1, 4) 6 µg of purified repair template, and 5) 1 mL of PLATE.\nAdd the following to a 1.5 mL tube in the order listed: 1) 100 µL of cells, 2) 40 µL of boiled and quick-cooled salmon sperm DNA (10 mg/mL), 3) H2O volume equal to that of transforming DNA in step 3.5, and 4) 1 mL of PLATE.\n\tNote: This will serve as a negative control.\nMix the transformations gently by pipetting and let incubate at 25 °C overnight.\nHeat shock the cells by placing them in a 44 °C water bath for 25 min.\nSpin for 5 min at 2,348 x g in a benchtop centrifuge and remove the PLATE mixture supernatant. Wash once by adding 1 mL of YPD + Uri and centrifuge again for 5 min at 2,348 x g.",
    "Suspend the cells in 0.1 mL of YPD + Uri and incubate on a roller drum or shaker at 25 °C overnight.\nPlate on YPD + Uri with 200 μg/mL nourseothricin. Colonies will appear in 2–5 days.\n4. Streaks for Single Colonies\nDivide a 100 mm x 15 mm Petri dish into quarters, and label each quadrant.\nTouch one of the colonies from the transformation plate with a sterile toothpick or applicator and streak across the longest side of the quadrant.\nStreak for single colonies using an aseptic technique and allow the colonies to grow at 30 °C for 2 days.\n5. Colony PCR\nDesign the forward check primer (FCP) ~200 base pairs upstream of the restriction site that was introduced and the reverse check primer (RCP) ~300 base pairs downstream.\nAdd 0.3 μL of FCP, 0.3 μL of RCP, 0.3 μL of thermostable polymerase (ExTaq 1.5 units), 3 μL of dNTPs (total concentration 40 mM), 3 μL of ExTaq Buffer, and 23 μL of H2O to a 1.5 mL tube.\nNOTE: Addition of 0.5 μL/reaction dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can improve PCR efficiency.\nAdd 0.25 μL of a single yeast colony from step 4.1.2 to the mixture from step 5.1.1, using a P10 pipette tip and taking care not to disturb the agar.\nAmplify DNA by PCR and run 5 μL of the PCR on a gel to ensure amplification is successful, taking care not to disturb the cell pellet at the bottom of the tube.\n6. Restriction Digestion of Colony PCR",
    "Add 10 μL of PCR product (taking care not to not disturb the cell pellet at the bottom of the tube), 3 μL of buffer, 1 μL of restriction enzyme, and 16 μL of H2O, then incubate according to manufacturer’s instructions and resolve on an agarose gel to identify correct genome edits.\nNOTE: The restriction enzyme used here is the site encoded in the TPK2 specific repair template.\n7. Saving Strains\nGrow an overnight culture from colonies that have been confirmed by restriction digestion in YPD + Uri at 30 °C.\nAdd 1 mL of culture and 1 mL of 50% glycerol (bringing the final concentration of glycerol to 25%) to a tube suitable for storage at -80 °C.\nStore the correct clones at -80 °C.\nNOTE: Correct strains can be stored at -80 °C for many years.\n8. Removal of Natr Marker\nStreak correct transformant onto yeast peptone maltose (YPMaltose) (2% maltose).\nPick a colony from the streaked plate and culture the yeast for 48 h at 30 °C in liquid YPMaltose 20 g/L maltose.\nPlate 200–400 cells on YPMaltose 20 g/L maltose and incubate at 30 °C for 24 h.\nReplicate the plate onto YPMaltose and YPMaltose 200 μg/mL Nat.\nIncubate at 30 °C for 24 h.\nNOTE: Colonies that no longer grow on YPMaltose 200 μg/mL nourseothricin but grow on YPMaltose have lost the Natr marker (CaCAS9) and guide RNA.\nSave the strains that have lost the Natr marker (CaCAS9) and guide RNA as done in steps 7.1–7.3.\nNOTE: A similar plasmid, pV1393, uses the SAP2 as opposed to a MAL2 promotor. Growth on YCB–BSA will induce flippase and removal of Natr if pV1393 is used for gene editing."
