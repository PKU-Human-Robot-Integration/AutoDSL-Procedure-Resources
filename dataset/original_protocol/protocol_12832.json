    "1. Identifying Synergy Prediction Mutants from Chemical-genetics Dataset by the Overlap2 Method (O2M)\nNOTE: This is the method for identifying synergy prediction mutants using the published dataset from Nichols et al.17 in E. coli. However, this can be done on any chemical-genetics dataset and microorganism. These data sets contain a library of knockout mutants grown in the presence of more than 100 small molecules, giving a quantitative growth score for each mutant in each small molecule. One synergistic pair must be known, and there should be growth scores for both small molecules included in the dataset.\nCalculate the mean growth score and standard deviation for all mutants grown in the presence of a single concentration of each small molecule.\n\tNOTE: This can be done using any spreadsheet software. The Brown lab uses Excel and the functions =AVERAGE(B3:B3981) and =STDEV(B3:B3981) for the calculations of each column of small molecule.\n\t\nCalculate the means and standard deviations from each column of small molecule, though this orientation may differ if using a different dataset.\nCalculate Z scores for each concentration of small molecule using the same dataset from Nichols et al.17 in a spreadsheet program. For this, negative z scores will be Z(2.5) = mean -2.5*standard deviation, and positive z scores will be Z(2.5) = mean + 2.5*standard deviation.\nDetermine which gene mutants contain significant Z scores in the small molecules that make up the known synergistic pair, being sure to look at all concentrations of those molecules. If the growth score of a mutant is less than the negative Z (2.5) score or is greater than the positive Z (2.5) score for that small molecule, it is considered significant.\nDetermine if any of the significant gene mutants belong to an operon.",
    "NOTE: For E. coli, the authors recommend checking \"Ecoli wiki\" for information regarding if genes are transcribed as part of a polycistronic RNA.\nIdentify gene/operon mutants that are common to the majority of the small molecules of interest at different concentrations (e.g., when looking for molecules that synergize with the antibiotic trimethoprim, identify mutants that show a significant Z score when grown in the presence of trimethoprim and its known synergistic partners such as sulfamethizole or sulfamethoxazole). These are putative synergy prediction mutants.\n2. Predicting Synergizers within the Chemical-genetics Dataset by O2M\nReturning to the dataset17, identify each concentration of small molecule that elicits a significant growth score from the synergy prediction mutant. This is done by looking at the Z scores calculated for each concentration of small molecules. Again, a significant growth score is less than the negative Z score or greater than the positive Z score for that concentration of small molecule.\n\tNOTE: If a molecule appears at even one of its concentrations, the molecule is considered a predicted synergizer. Any molecule that does not elicit a significant growth score is a predicted non-synergizer.\n3. Validation of Predicted Synergistic Interactions\nFinding minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of predicted synergizers.\nGrow an overnight culture of E. coli in M9 minimal media at 37 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: Any overnight culture can be grown in appropriately defined medium for the organism of interest. The Brown lab does not recommend rich media like LB or YPD. M9 minimal media consists of 10.5 g/L M9 broth, 0.2% casamino acids, 0.1 M CaCl2, 0.4% glucose, 1 M MgSO4, 0.25% nicotinic acid, and 0.33% thiamine in H2O.\nIf no MIC data for pathogen of interest is found in the literature upon receiving the small molecules, dissolve in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a high concentration (>10 mg/mL).",
    "Using a 96-well plate, add 100 µL of M9 media to each well. Add an extra 100 µL of M9 media in column 1 so it contains a total of 200 µL.\nAdd an arbitrary amount (~10 µL) of concentrated small molecule solution in column 1. One small molecule per well of column 1 (8 small molecules per plate).\n\t\tNOTE: These are the small molecules of interest, that are predicted to synergize. The Brown lab generally adds 10 µL of highly concentrated small molecule solution, which is below the amount of 100% DMSO that can inhibit E. coli.\nOnce the small molecules have been added, dilute the small molecules across the x-axis of the plate. Take 100 µL of solution from column 1, place in column 2 and mix. Take 100 µL from column 2, place in column 3 and mix. Continue this process until 100 µL are placed in column 11. Mix column 11, then take 100 µL from that column and discard. Leave column 12 with just media to normalize the data.\nInoculate the plate. Obtain the optical density (OD600) from an overnight culture. Prepare a solution with the culture and M9 media to an OD600 of 0.002 (or appropriate concentration that represents 500 cells/µL for the desired organism of interest). Pipette 2 µL of culture solution into each well of the plate so there are 1,000 cells per well.\nGently shake the plate and obtain the OD600 for the 0 h reading. Let the plate grow at 37 °C for 24 h. Obtain the OD600 for the 24 h reading.\n\t\tNOTE: Use appropriate growing conditions for other organisms of interest.\nCalculate the net growth for each well using a spreadsheet program.",
    "Average the net growth of column 12 to obtain the average no drug growth. Normalize the other wells to the average of no drug growth using a spreadsheet software. Look for any well with less than 10% growth to identify the MIC90. Any well with less than 50% growth indicates the MIC50. Calculate the concentration of small molecule in those wells.\nCheckerboard Assays for synergistic interactions\nGrow an overnight culture of E. coli in M9 minimal media as before.\n\t\tNOTE: Use appropriate growing conditions for other organisms.\nAdd 100 µL of M9 media to each well of a 96 well plate and an extra 100 µL in column 1.\nAdd the test small molecule (at ~8x MIC) to each well in column 1 and add double the concentration (~16x MIC) to well A1 (one small molecule tested per plate).\n\t\tNOTE: This amount is determined from the MIC test completed prior and differs for each potential synergizer.\nCreate a gradient dilution on the x-axis by taking 100 µL from column 1 and transferring to column 2. Continue this process until 100 µL is added to column 11. Mix, then take 100 µL from column 11 and dispose. Do not add any drug to column 12 (Figure 1A).\nSet up the second drug gradient across the y-axis for the input drug. Add 100 µL of media containing 2x MIC of the input molecule in row A. Mix and dilute as before, taking 100 µL from row A and placing in B. Continue until 100 µL is placed in row G. Mix, take 100 µL and dispose, ensuring not to add any input drug in row H. This allows row H and column 12 to contain individual MICs of the drug pair tested (Figure 1B).",
    "Inoculate the plate. Add 2 µL of a E. coli culture of OD600 0.002 to each well (1,000 cells per well).\nMeasure the OD600 of each well in the plate for the 0 h reading.\nIncubate the plate for 24 h at 37 °C.\nMeasure the OD600 of each well at 24 h.\nCalculating the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) from Checkerboards\nCalculate the net growth for each well of the plate by subtracting the OD600 at 0 h from the OD600 at 24 h in a spreadsheet program.\nNormalize the growth in the software by dividing each well by well H12, which contains no small molecule.\nFind the MIC90 of the input molecule in column 12 and the MIC90 of the potential synergist in row H.\nLook for all wells that inhibit 90% of growth.\nCalculate the FICI90 for the well that is either the lowest below (synergistic) or highest above (antagonistic) both MIC90 values, using the equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/57241/57241eq1.jpg\nConsider any FICI ≤ 0.5 as synergistic and FICI ≥ 4 as antagonistic (Figure 2).\n\t\tNOTE: This can also be done with MIC50 (50% inhibition of growth) to get an FICI50 based on those MIC values.\nBliss Independence Assay\n\tNOTE: Bliss Independence is run with any potential synergist that did not have an MIC on its own.\n\t\nGrow an overnight culture of E. coli in M9 media at 37 °C, as before.\n\t\tNOTE: Again, appropriate growing conditions for other organisms of interest can be used in this step.\nPrepare 96-well plates for testing the potential synergistic molecule, the input molecule, the combination, and a non-treated control.",
    "Create the potential synergist plate by adding 50 µL of M9 media to each well. Add 50 µL of media containing a set concentration (10 µM or 100 µM) of the potential synergist to each well of a row. Test 8 molecules per plate.\nCreate the input molecule plate by adding 50 µL of media to each well. Add 50 µL containing 4x MIC of the input drug to each well in column 1. Create a gradient dilution along the x-axis similar to MIC plates, taking 50 µL from column 1, dispersing and mixing in column 2. Continue this process until column 12, disposing 50 µL from column 12. Add an additional 50 µL of media to each well so the end total for each well is 100 µL.\nCreating the combination plate by using a 96 well plate, add 50 µL of media to each well. Add 50 µL containing 4x MIC of the input drug to each well in column 1. Dilute along the x-axis similar to MIC plates, taking 50 µL from column 1, dispersing and mixing in column 2. Continue this the whole way to column 12, disposing 50 µL from column 12. Add 50 µL of media containing the potential synergist at 10 µM or 100 µM to each well of a row. Again, there should be one concentration or drug per row.\nCreate the non-treated control by adding 100 µL of M9 media to all wells of the plate.\nInoculate all plates by adding 2 µL of bacterial culture with an OD600 of 0.002 or 1,000 cells to each well as before.\nMeasure the OD600 of each well at 0 and 24 h.\nCalculating the Bliss Independence Score",
    "Calculate the net growth for each well of the plate by subtracting the OD600 at 0 h from the growth at 24 h using a spreadsheet program.\nNormalize the wells to the average growth from the no drug plate in a spreadsheet program.\nUsing spreadsheet software, calculate the inhibition by subtracting the net growth from 1.\nAverage the columns in the control plate containing only the input gradient in the spreadsheet software.\nCalculate the bliss score for each well by the equation:\nBliss Score = (well X + input column X) – Combined well X\nLook for negative scores in wells below the MIC90 of the input.\n\t\tNOTE: Negative scores across multiple concentrations would indicate a synergistic interaction.\n4. High-throughput Screen with Synergy Prediction Mutants to Identify Novel Synergistic Pairs\nIdentify synergy prediction mutants\n\tNOTE: Step 1.5 identified putative synergy prediction mutants. Here, we determine which of these mutants will function best in a high-throughput screen for synergistic drugs. We performed this assay in a Bioscreen machine, but 96 well plate readers should also be acceptable.\n\t\nGrow each putative synergy prediction mutants and wild-type cells in M9 minimal media.\nSet up the 100 well honeycomb plate (or 96 well plate) with the appropriate growth medium, growth medium + input drug, growth medium + known synergistic partner of the input drug, and growth medium + known non-synergistic drug. Ensure to include vehicle controls.\n\t\tNOTE: We recommend four replicate wells for each strain/drug/concentration.\nInoculate 1,000 cells per well, including blank control wells.\nGrow 48 h at 37 °C, with shaking, and read OD600 every 20 min.",
    "Determine drug concentration and time point that shows the largest growth difference between wild-type and synergy prediction mutant cells in the presence of the input drug and its known synergistic partners. At the optimal time point and concentration, there should not be much growth difference between wild-type and synergy prediction mutant cells when grown in the presence of drugs known to not act synergistically with the input drug (Figure 3).\nHigh-throughput screen for synergistic drugs\nGrow wild-type cells and synergy prediction mutant cells in M9 minimal media.\n\t\tNOTE: Use appropriate growth medium for organism of interest.\nAdd drugs from the library to media so each well which contains 100 µL media with small molecules at set concentration which was determined in the previous step. Include blank wells (without cells) and wells with vehicle controls (e.g., DMSO) to account for any growth inhibition by the drug dilution vehicle.\n\t\t\nPrepare at least four vehicle control wells per plate, ideally scattered across the plate to account for well position effects. If assays are variable, then include at least one vehicle control well per row/column and use each row/column control well as the control to calculate Z scores for each row/column instead of for an entire plate (step 4.2.5).\nAdd 2 µL of culture to each well as before. (One plate for wild type bacteria and one plate for predicted synergy mutant bacteria).\nAssess the OD600 at 0 and 18 h for E. coli or 48 h for C. neoformans.\nUsing spreadsheet software, calculate the net growth by subtracting the OD600 of blank wells from the vehicle control wells. Identify wells with a Z-score of -2.5 (Z score = mean - 2.5*standard deviation). These wells contain a potential synergist small molecule.\nValidate screen hits using the methods outlined in step 3.",
