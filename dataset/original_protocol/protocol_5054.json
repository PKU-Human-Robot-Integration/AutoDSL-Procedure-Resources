    "Notes: The in situ hybridization procedure has been described in detail in the Exiqon ISH protocol.Caution of RNA work All steps should take place in a clean and nuclease free environment.All surfaces should be cleaned with RNaseZap. Wear gloves at all times and use autoclaved glassware and RNase grade MilliQ water which is autoclaved for preparation of all solutions. In situ hybridization was performed as mentioned in the Exiqon manual. Optimization Optimization of Proteinase K treatment required before the start of the actual assay. Proteinase K reagent prepared immediately before use at a concentration of 15 µg/ml.Optimization of LNA miRNA probe and scramble miRNA. A probe concentration of 80 nM was optimal for detection of miR-409-3p and miR-409-5p. Reagents to be prepared on the day of the experiment Proteinase KHybridization mix: Place the appropriate amount of probe in a 2 ml non-stick RNase-free tube. Denature the probe at 90 °C for 4 min. Centrifuge the tubes and spin down. Add 2 ml of 1x miRNA ISH buffer. Deparaffinize slides in xylene and ethanolXylene - 5 min, 3 times in a glass jar99.9% ethanol - 10 min, 2 times, in a glass jar99.9% ethanol - 5 min, 1 time, in a glass jar96% ethanol - 10 min, 1 time, in a glass jar96% ethanol - 5 min, 1 time, in a glass jar70% ethanol - 10 min, 1 time, in a glass jar70% ethanol - 5 min, 1 time, in a glass jarPBS - 2-5 min, each 1 time, in a glass jarProteinase K treatment and washAdd Proteinase K to Proteinase K buffer (final concentration 15 µg/ml) (add 7.5 µl Proteinase K stock to 10 ml Proteinase K buffer). Add sufficient volume of proteinase K solution to cover the slides (instructions in the Exiqon manual).",
    "Incubate for 10 min, at 37 °C, in a Hybridizer.Transfer the slides into a new glass jar containing PBS. Repeat this step twice.HybridizationUse PAP pen to mark around the tissue section. Using a glass cutter cut the coverslip (autoclaved) to the size of the tumor tissue section. Add miRNA detection probe (50 µl, hybridization mix) on the tissue section. Avoid air bubbles. If a slide has several serial tissues sections of the same tumor, it can be used to determine several probes (such as miR-409-3p, miR-409-5p and Scramble miRNA). Once the probe is added, place the cut coverslip very carefully without trapping air bubbles. Seal the edge of the coverslip to the slide using colorless nail polish. Let it dry. Place the slides in the Hybridizer at 55 °C for 1 h. Disassembly and washesCarefully remove the coverslips. Place the slides into a glass jar with 5x SSC in a water bath at 55 °C.Note: Use a water bath at 55 °C to do the washes in glass jars. The graded SSC solutions were prepared with autoclaved water.5x SSC - 5 min 55 °C1x SSC - 5 min 55 °C1x SSC - 5 min 55 °C0.2x SSC - 5 min 55 °C0.2x SSC - 5 min 55 °C0.2x SSC - 5 min RTIncubate the slides in PBS.BlockingThe slides were incubated in PBS containing 2.5% horse serum and 20% streptavidin block reagent for 1 h at room temperature.Single QD labelingStreptavidin-conjugated QDs (565 nm [green] and 625 nm [red]) were prepared at a 10 nM concertation in PBS-T with 6% IgG-free, protease free BSA. The slides were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min.Washing The slides were washed 3 times for 5 min each in PBS-T (PBS + 0.4% Triton X-100 + 0.1% Tween-20).",
    "MountingCover the slides with cover glass using aqueous mounting media containing 4’6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).  Image acquisitionThe CRi spectral imaging system was used. Multispectral images were taken using the Nuance v3.1 software. For each field of the tissue, serial images were taken from 450 to 800 nm with an interval of 10 nm. This generates a cube a stack of 36 separate images at different wavelengths and has spectral information for every pixel in the image. Images are acquired at 400x magnification (Figure 2). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170216/20170216224034_7863.jpgFigure 2.

DAPI was stained in blue. Scrambled miRNA was used as a negative control, on a adjacent section on an separate slide of the same tissue. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) was also performed.
