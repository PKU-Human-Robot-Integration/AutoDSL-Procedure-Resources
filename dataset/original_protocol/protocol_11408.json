    "All work was done in accordance with The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (HUM 00052430) and conforms to procedures approved by the University Committee on Use and Care of Animals (UCUCA). The Unit for Laboratory of Animal Medicine (ULAM) oversaw animal care.\nAll work was done with approval from The University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (HUM 00052430) and conforms to all human research ethics committee regulations. Human cells are considered to be a potentially biohazardous material, so follow all special precautions and appropriate biosafety practices that are required by your institution. NSG mice are severely immunocompromised and susceptible to disease caused by bacteria commonly found in the environment.\nAlways use strict sterile technique when preparing materials for implantation and performing the injections.\n1. Cell Culture\nGrow established human NB cell lines (SH-SY5Y, SK-N-BE2, and IMR32) in minimal essential medium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. Supplement IMR32 cells further with 1 mM pyruvate and 0.075% NaHCO3. Maintain all cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and 70-80% confluence.\nGrow human ES cell lines (TC32, A673, CHLA-25, and A4573) in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 6 mM L-glutamine. Maintain all cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 at 70-80% confluence.\nSend all cell lines for authentication.\n\tNOTE: Cell authentication is done at an outside facility, please refer to acknowledgements.\n2. Preparation of Primary Patient-Derived Tumor Cells\nWith patient consent and assent, harvest discarded human NB tumor tissue from patients undergoing surgical resection for local control and transport to the laboratory in tissue storage solution for preservation.\n\tNOTE: All patient samples are de-identified and handled in accordance with Institutional Review Board guidelines.",
    "Generate a single patient-derived cancer cell suspension (UMNBL001, UMNBL002) from tumor tissue using a tumor dissociation kit. Transfer approximately 0.5 g of tumor to a 100 mm cell culture dish containing 5 mL of RPMI buffer, 200 µL of enzyme H, 100 µL of enzyme R and 25 µL of enzyme A from the human tumor dissociation kit.\nMince the tumor into small pieces (2-4 mm each) using scissors and tissue forceps. Mix these fragments with the solutions in step 2.2.\nPipette the tumor mixture into a dissociator tube and close the tube. Invert the tube and attach onto the sleeve of the tissue dissociator. Run on program h_tumor_01.\nIncubate the tumor cell suspension obtained above at 37 °C for 1 h on a rotating rack with intermittent trituration every 15 min.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a new 50 mL conical tube and add 10 mL of RPMI. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 314 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and suspend the pellet in 5 mL of RPMI. Pass this solution through a 40 µm cell strainer and collect the strained solution into a fresh 50 mL conical tube. Wash this strainer once with 5 mL of RPMI media and centrifuge the mixture at 314 x g for 5 min to collect a pellet.\nMeasure the cell density using a hemacytometer15. Suspend the pellet obtained from above in RPMI to obtain a final concentration of 4 × 105 cells/10 µL. Take 5 µL of this cell suspension and 5 µL of matrigel to make 10 µL of cell solution for each injection.",
    "NOTE: Amount of RPMI used depends on the cell density measurement. For example, if the measured cell density of the obtained pellet is 4 x 105 cells, suspend the pellet in 10 µL of RPMI.\n3. Luciferase Tagging of Cancer Cells\nMake 10 mL of transduction media with 5 mL of viral supernatant EF1a-Luc2-IRES-mCherry and 5 mL of stem cell media. Add 7.5 µL of 1x polybrene.\nMix 5 × 106 cancer cells in transduction media and plate in 100 mm ultra-low attachment plate. Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 overnight.\n\tNOTE: As low attachment plates are used, cells will not adhere to plate.\nAfter 24 h, bring the 100 mm plate containing cells under tissue culture hood and transfer the mixture into a 15 mL conical tube. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 314 x g for 5 min to get the cell pellet. Wash the cell pellet once with 1 mL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and suspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of HBSS containing 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\n\t\nSort luciferase cells based on GFP-positive signal on fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis. Plate the sorted cells on 100 mm tissue culture treated dish and maintain at 70-80% confluence, 37 °C and 5% CO2 until required.\nConfirm luciferase signal with luciferase assay kit. Plate 10 x 104 sorted cells per well in an illuminometer compatible 96 well plate and incubate cells overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 24 h, bring the 96 well plate to room temperature and add Steady-Glo reagent to cultured media in wells in 1:1 ratio. Allow cells to lyse for 5 min and read luminescence in spectrophotometer.",
    "Bring the 100 mm dish under a tissue culture hood. Discard the supernatant media. Wash the cells once with 2 mL of 1x PBS.\nAdd 2 mL of 0.25% trypsin and return the 100 mm dish to the incubator for 2-3 min. After 2-3 min, check for dislodged cells under microscope and add 8 mL of RPMI to deactivate trypsin.\nCollect the cell suspension in a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge at 314 x g for 5 min to get a pellet. Discard the supernatant. Wash the cell pellet with 1 mL of 1x PBS, suspend the pellet in 5 mL of RPMI and determine the cell density using a hemacytometer15. Centrifuge yhe remaining cell solution at 314 x g for 5 min to obtain a pellet.\nSuspend the pellet in RPMI to obtain a concentration of 4 x 105 cells/10 µL. Take 5 µL of the cell suspension and 5 µL of matrigel to make 10 µL of cell solution for each injection.\n4. Ultrasound Guided Adrenal Gland (NB) or Renal Sub Capsule (ES) Implantation\nNOTE: All ultrasound procedures are performed using a high resolution in vivo imaging system. For the described procedures, the transducer, which has a center frequency of 40 MHz and a bandwidth of 22-55 MHz was used.\nUtilize 6-8-week-old immune-deficient NSG mice for all injection procedures.\nChill the matrigel and autoclaved Hamilton syringes fitted with a 27G needle (1.25\"), and 22G catheters (0.9 mm external diameter, 25 mm length) overnight at 4 °C.\nPlace the cell solution prepared in step 3 on ice.\nAnesthetize the mice in an induction chamber using 2% isoflurane in O2 delivered at 2 L/min.\n\tNOTE: Adequate anesthesia is determined with the lack of active movement and the maintenance of spontaneous respiration.",
    "Once anesthetized, depilate the back and flank of the animals using hair removal lotion (such as Nair) and a shaver.\nTransfer the animal to the imaging platform with abdominal side down, where the nose of the animal is placed into a nosecone and secured while inhaling isoflurane.\nPlace optical ointment in the animal's eyes to prevent drying. Tape the mouse in place to prevent any inadvertent movement.\nIdentify the murine liver, vena cava, spleen, left kidney, and adjacent left adrenal gland using ultrasound visualization.\nUse sterile gloves, mask and cap for personal protection and maintenance of sterile conditions. Under ultrasound-guidance, gently insert a 22G catheter through the skin and back muscle directly into the left adrenal gland to provide a channel for cellular injection. Remove the needle and leave the catheter in place.\nLoad a chilled Hamilton syringe fitted with a small-bore needle with 10 µL of cell solution, then guide the syringe stereotactically through the catheter positioned into the center of the adrenal gland.\nInject the cells into the targeted adrenal tissue. Leave the needle in place for 1-2 min to allow the matrigel to set. Slowly remove the needle, followed by the removal of the catheter.\nPlace the mice back into their cage and ensure that the mouse regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n\tNOTE: Due to the minimally invasive nature of this technique, post procedural pain is minimal, but still monitored on a daily basis with mice health checks.\" should be followed with a sentence: \"If unexpected signs of pain or distress are identified during the course of an experiment, consult with your institutional veterinary support unit for information regarding analgesia or other medical care.\nSubscription Required.
