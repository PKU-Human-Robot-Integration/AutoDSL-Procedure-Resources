    "1. RNA quantity and quality assessment\nSelect the FFPE samples according to predefined criteria and extract RNA using an appropriate method (e.g., FFPE-nuclei acid extraction kit, Table of Materials).\n\tNOTE: There are several different methods available for FFPE-RNA extraction, including the newer microdissection methods that can work with very little tissue and extract good quality RNA12,13,14.\nUtmost care should be taken to preserve the integrity of RNA at all stages. This includes working with RNase free deionised water, using RNase free plasticware, and cleaning all instruments that come in contact with the FFPE blocks with RNase decontamination reagents.\nRNA should always be handled carefully and kept in ice unless otherwise specified to minimize degradation while handling.\nIf enough material is available, extract RNA from more than one region in the FFPE block to generate biological replicates from as many samples as possible. For some of the samples with ample RNA yield, divide the extracted RNA into two to process as technical replicates.\nIf possible, collect a small amount of sample separately after extraction for QC (i.e., a QC aliquot) to avoid repeated handling and freeze-thaw cycles of the sample that will likely lead to degradation of the RNA.\nCheck the quality of the RNA (preferably from the QC aliquot) by running it on an RNA QC system (e.g., Agilent Bioanalyzer system using an RNA Nano chip, Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nAnalyze the distribution of RNA fragments in the samples (e.g., using the Bioanalyzer 2100 Expert software) by calculating the DV200 and DV100 values as the percent of fragments larger than 200 nt (DV200) or 100 nt (DV100) in size.",
    "Among DV200 and DV100, identify the metric that has a larger spread of values for the given sample set, and pick that for grouping the samples according to their degree of intactness.\n\tNOTE: For sample sets with more intact RNA molecules (i.e., high DV200 values, all or most with DV200 > 40%), DV200 is likely to be a useful QC metric. However, for sample sets with more degraded transcripts (i.e., low DV200 values, all or most with DV200 < 40%), DV100 is more likely to be useful.\nBased on the QC metrics, identify the samples that have DV100 < 40%. Because this degree of degradation is highly likely to not generate useful sequencing data11, it is advisable to avoid processing such samples. If replacements for such samples are available, their quality should be checked to ideally only include samples with DV100 > 50%.\n2. Sequencing library preparation\nBased on the quality of the samples as assessed in section 1, identify an appropriate method for generating the sequencing libraries.\n\t\nFor sample sets with very low degradation and high DV200 values, use mRNA sequencing (i.e., capture of polyadenylated transcripts), targeted RNA sequencing (i.e., use of capture probes for specific genes of interest), RNA exome sequencing (i.e., use of capture probes to enrich for the coding transcriptome), or total RNA sequencing (i.e., use of random primers for reverse transcription to sequence the entire RNA population after removing ribosomal RNA from the samples). However, it is important to note that the fixation process may introduce bias in the extracted RNA. Thus, the capture approaches may not work well in all cases, even with high DV200 values.",
    "If the sample set includes samples with high degradation (DV200 < 30%), use a total RNA library preparation method and not one that depends on the capture of specific regions of the transcripts, because those specific regions may be missing in degraded samples. The use of random primers for generation of cDNA leads to higher representation of usable RNA in the final library, and is, therefore, more suited for FFPE-RNA samples.\nFor ribosomal RNA depletion for sample sets with high degradation, use RNaseH-based methods. These are methods where rRNA-specific DNA probes bind to rRNA, double-stranded molecules are digested by RNaseH, and leftover probes are cleaned up by DNase (e.g., NEBNext rRNA depletion kit, Table of Materials). These methods work better for degraded samples than some other methods8.\nFor generating sequencing libraries, use higher input amounts (if possible) for samples that have more degraded RNA (DV100 < 60%). While samples with reasonably good quality RNA (DV100 > 60%) may yield good sequence data even at lower input amounts (the lowest tested for this protocol with FFPE-RNA was ~20 ng), for more degraded RNA (DV100 < 60%), it is better to start with higher input amounts (e.g., >100 ng).\n\tNOTE: If enough (e.g., >500 ng) sample is available, it is advisable to save at least half of the sample for repeating the library preparation, if needed. For low input samples (e.g., <100 ng), it is usually better to use the entire amount and generate a library of sufficient diversity.\nAfter selecting a suitable library preparation kit for generating total RNA seq libraries from samples with high degradation (e.g., NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina, see Table of Materials), follow the manufacturer’s instructions to generate the libraries.",
    "NOTE: During library preparation, it is important to skip the RNA fragmentation step for degraded samples and to ensure the use of random primers for first strand cDNA synthesis.\nFor improving the efficiency and speed, especially for the low-input samples, use appropriate magnetic racks with strong fixed magnets for bead-based purification and size-selection steps (see Table of Materials).\nFor PCR enrichment of adapter ligated DNA, adjust the number of amplification cycles based on the amount of input DNA to ensure maximum representation while avoiding unnecessary duplication of the library molecules. For low input FFPE-RNA samples (<100 ng), we recommend 16–18 amplification cycles, while the high input samples (1,000 ng) usually generate enough library amounts in 12–14 rounds of amplification.\nFollowing PCR amplification and cleanup per the manufacturer’s instructions, assess the library quality by analyzing library concentration and molecule distribution on an appropriate platform (e.g., Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA Chip, see Table of Materials). For samples with primer peaks (~80 bp) or adapter-dimer peaks (~128 bp), repeat the cleanup to remove those peaks.\nCalculate the average library size for each library (e.g., using the Bioanalyzer 2100 Expert software).\n3. Sequencing library QC\nOnce it has been ascertained that the libraries are free of excess primer and adapter-dimers and have sufficient concentration for subsequent sequencing, quantitate further by qPCR.",
    "NOTE: Owing to the sensitivity of cluster generation towards library concentration, accurate quantification is vital to prevent costly sequencing runs from underperformance or overloading. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) methods are useful for improving cluster density on Illumina platforms without resulting in overclustering. The qPCR method is more precise and more sensitive than the methods based on qualitative and/or quantitative analysis of all library molecules (e.g., Agilent Bioanalyzer), because it measures the templates that have both adapter sequences on either end that will form clusters on the flowcell. Library size must, however, be known in advance as a size correction must be applied to all samples so that results can be compared against a standard curve.\n\tCAUTION: Lab coats and gloves must always be worn when performing qPCR, and the procedure must be performed in a biosafety cabinet following the manufacturer’s instructions.\n\t\nSet up a 96 well plate with three replicates for each sample for error prevention using a suitable kit (e.g., KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Master Mix for Illumina libraries, a part of Library Quantification kit, see Table of Materials), along with the standards, a positive control (e.g, PhiX control, see Table of Materials), and a no template control (NTC). The NTC is qPCR mix without DNA library. The positive control can be any library with known concentration and fragment size.\n\t\t\nPrepare a minimum of six dilutions of the standards following the vendor protocol.\nAfter adding all the components (i.e., qPCR master mix, libraries, standards), cover the plate with sealing film and use a squeegee to ensure the film makes even and secure contact with the plate.\nVortex and spin down the plate at 1,500 rpm for at least 1 min. Visually inspect the plate to make sure there are no air bubbles at the bottom of the wells.",
    "Set up the plate on the thermal cycler (e .g. CFX96 Touch System, see Table of Materials) using the manufacturer's recommended settings.\nSave the run folder where it can be accessed for data analysis.\nDuring data analysis, check that the slope is in the -3.1 to -3.6 range, efficiency from 90% to 110% and the R2 (coefficient of correlation obtained for the standard curve) no less than 0.98.\nPooling: Once the qPCR concentration of the sequencing ready libraries is obtained, pool equimolar amounts of each of the libraries, depending on the number of sequencing reads required per sample and the sequencing output of the instrument.\nQC of the pools: Quantitate the library pools again by qPCR following the same protocol as described in step 3.1.\n4. Sequencing\nDepending on the run parameters, pull the sequencing reagent kits and thaw them following the user guide. Please check the Illumina website for the latest versions of all user guides for sequencing on Illumina instruments.\nMake sure the reagents are completely thawed and place the reagents tray at 4 °C. The run should be started no later than 2 h after the reagents have been defrosted. Not doing that could affect quality of the run results.\nInvert the cartridge 5x to mix reagents and gently tap on the bench to reduce air bubbles.\nSet the unwrapped flow cell package aside at room temperature for 30 min.\nUnwrap the flow cell package and clean the glass surface of the flow cell with a lint-free alcohol wipe. Dry the glass with a low-lint laboratory tissue.\nOpen the Illumina “Experiment Manager” application. Choose “Create Sample Sheet”, then choose the Sequencer and click “Next”.\nCreate and upload the sample sheet based on Illumina sequencer criteria (e.g., Illumina Experiment Manager, software guide).",
    "At the prompts, scan in the reagent kit barcode and enter the run Set Up Parameters (e.g., for a single indexed PE 75 cycle run, enter 76-8-76).\nDenature and dilute the library pool based on the sequencer user guide recommendation (e.g., NextSeq 500 System guide from Illumina, see Table of Materials).\nDenature and dilute the control library PhiX (see Table of Materials) to the appropriate concentration (e.g., 1.8 pM for NextSeq).\nMix sample library and PhiX control to result in a 1% PhiX control volume ratio.\nLoad denatured and diluted sample into the reagent cartridge in the designated reservoir.\nLoad the flowcell, buffer cartridge, and the reagent cartridge.\nPerform an automated check and review to ensure that the run parameters pass the system check.\nWhen the automated check is complete, select Start to begin the sequencing run.\n5. Data analysis and quality assessment\nNOTE: A typical RNA-seq data analysis workflow (Figure 1) includes preprocessing and QC, alignment to genome and post alignment QC, gene and transcript quantification, sample correlation analysis, differential analysis between different sample groups, treatment conditions, and gene set enrichment and pathway analysis.\nThe RNA-seq data may have quality issues that can affect the accuracy of gene profiling and lead to erroneous conclusions. Therefore, initial QC checks for sequencing quality, contamination, sequencing coverage bias, and other sources of artifacts are very important. Applying an RNA-Seq QC pipeline similar to the workflow described here is recommended to detect artifacts and apply filtering or correction before downstream analysis.\nPreprocessing\n\tNOTE: This includes demultiplexing, assessment of sequence read quality, GC content, presence of sequencing adapters, overrepresented k-mers, and PCR duplicated reads. This information helps to detect sequencing errors, PCR artifacts, or contamination.",
    "Demultiplex Illumina sequencing run using the Illumina software tool bcl2fastq2 to generate raw FASTQ files for each sample defined in the sample sheet. Allow one mismatch in the sample index barcodes to tolerate sequencing errors if there is no barcode collision.\nRun the FASTQC15 software tool to perform a quality check on raw FASTQ files to detect any poor quality or abnormalities in sequencing reads.\nFor adapter and low-quality bases trimming, trim the sequencing adapters and low quality bases using Cutadapt16 or Trimmomatic17 software tools. Save the trimmed reads in the pair-end fastq files.\nContamination screen\n\t\t\nRun FASTQ_screen18 to detect possible cross contamination with other species.\nRun miniKraken of Kraken219 to identify the taxonomies of contaminating species.\nAlignment to reference genome and post alignment QC\n\t\nThe trimmed reads can be aligned to a reference genome sequence (GRCh Build hg19 or hg38) using STAR aligner20. Apply the Gencode annotation GTF file to guide the spliced transcript alignment. It is recommended to run STAR 2-pass to increase sensitivity to novel splice junctions. In the second pass, all reads will be remapped using annotated gene and transcripts and novel junctions from the first pass.\nPerform post-alignment QC.\n\t\t\nRun Picard’s21 MarkDuplicates to evaluate the library complexity by determining the amount of unique or nonduplicated reads in the samples.\nRun Picard’s CollectRnaSeqMetrics program to collect mapping percentages on coding, intronic, intergenic, UTR regions, and gene body coverage.\nRun RSeQC22 to determine the read pair inner distance, read distribution among CDS exons, 5’UTR, 3’UTR, intron, TSS_up_1kb, TSS_up_5kb, TSS_up_10kb, TES_down_1kb, TES_down_5kb, TES_down_10kb, read GC content, junction saturation, and library strand information.\nRun multi-QC23 to generate an aggregated report in HTML format.\nGene quantification and correction analysis",
    "Run RSEM24 to get raw count as well as normalized read count on genes and transcripts. The read count measurement such as RPKM (reads per kilobase of exon model per million reads), FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads), and TPM (transcripts per million) are the most often reported RNA-seq gene expression values. Genes expressed below a noised threshold (such as TPM < 1 or raw count <5) can be filtered.\nPerform transcript quantification to aggregate raw counts of mapped reads to each transcript sequences using programs such as HTSeq-count or featureCounts.\nRun Principal Components Analysis (PCA) using an R script to determine batch effects and assess a quality map of the given dataset25. Sample correlation analysis can be carried out using the Pearson correlation between different metrics.\nDifferential gene expression analysis\nPerform gene differential analysis between sample conditions using the program edgeR26,27 and/or limma-Voom28 and use normalization methods including TPM, TMM, DESeq, or UpperQuartile.\nIt is recommended to run at least two differential analysis software tools in order to call two set of DEGs lists for comparison and get the final DEGs to improve detection sensitivity and accuracy.\nGene set enrichment and pathway analysis\nPerform Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)29,30 based on ranking of transcripts according to a measurement of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) list to determine if the DEGs show statistically significant, concordant differences between biological conditions.\nPerform function analysis using resources such as Gene Ontology31, DAVID32,33, or other available software tools.\nSubscription Required.
