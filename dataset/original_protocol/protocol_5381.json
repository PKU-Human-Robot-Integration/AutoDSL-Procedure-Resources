    "The basic steps for using TEM to analyze mitochondrial ultrastructure in skeletal muscle are presented in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180514/20180514182631_4981.jpgFigure 1. The schematic view of general procedures for TEM of skeletal muscle from start to finish Primary fixationThe goal of primary fixation with glutaraldehyde is to preserve the ultrastructure of the skeletal muscle tissue in a physiologically relevant state by cross-linking proteins, primarily reacting with nucleophiles and other amines.Following Recipe 1, prepare the 3% glutaraldehyde solution. Remove the muscle tissue and immediately submerge it in 3% glutaraldehyde in a glass specimen vial and label accordingly (see Note 1).Place the specimen vials on a clinical rotator for 30 min at room temperature. After 30 min, quickly transfer the muscle to filter paper and cut it into the desired size (for mouse soleus, the muscle is cut in half for transverse and longitudinal sections, respectively) using a razor blade or scalpel with a light pulling motion to slice, do not crush tissue (see Note 2). As quickly as possible, place each new section of tissue into its own specimen vial filled with 3% glutaraldehyde and label the vials appropriately. Place the specimen vials on a clinical rotator and leave for 24 h at room temperature.Secondary fixationThe purpose of secondary fixation with osmium tetroxide is two-fold, it cross-links lipids preserving their structure and it effectively stains the tissue by adding electron-dense material, enhancing contrast.Following Recipe 2, prepare 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.4.Remove the 3% glutaraldehyde from the specimen vials with a transfer pipette and transfer the solution to a proper waste container.Add phosphate buffer to the specimen vials and return the samples to the clinical rotator for 5 min.",
    "Dispose of the phosphate buffer in the proper waste container and repeat Step B3 twice more, on the third wash before disposing of the phosphate buffer, have your 1% osmium solution ready so that your sample does not dry out.Following Recipe 3, prepare 1% osmium tetroxide (see Note 3). Under a chemical fume hood with complete attention and care, dispense 1% osmium tetroxide into the specimen vials, cap the vials, and then return to the clinical rotator for 1 h. The specimens should appear black. Under a fume hood, remove the 1% osmium tetroxide solution from the specimen vials and dispose of the solution into the appropriate waste container. Dispose of the plastic caps in an appropriate waste container as well and then use new plastic caps on your specimen vials for subsequent steps.Add the phosphate buffer to the specimen vials and return the samples to the clinical rotator for 5 min.Dispose of the phosphate buffer in the proper waste container and repeat Step B10 twice more.DehydrationWater must be removed from the tissue through graded alcohol dehydration to allow for the infiltration of embedding media.Following Recipe 4, prepare all ethanol dilutions. Transfer 10% ethanol solution to the specimen vials and return them to the clinical rotator for 5 min.Remove 10% ethanol and repeat Step C2 with 25%, 50%, 75%, and 95% ethanol solutions.Transfer 100% ethanol to the specimen vials and return them to the clinical rotator for 5 min.Remove 100% ethanol and repeat Step C4 twice more. Under a chemical fume hood, transfer 100% propylene oxide to the specimen vials and cap the lids tightly (lids may pop off if not secured). Return the samples to the clinical rotator for 5 min.Remove the 100% propylene oxide and dispose of it in the proper waste container.",
    "Repeat Steps C6, C7, and C8 twice more.Infiltration and embeddingPropylene oxide is equally miscible in both alcohol and embedding media, thereby clearing the alcohol and facilitating infiltration of the embedding media into the depths of the tissue.Following Recipe 5, prepare the embedding media. In a chemical fume hood, prepare a 2:1 (propylene oxide:embedding media) solution, the total volume you make will depend on how many samples you have (you want enough solution to completely cover your sample, even when rotating).Transfer 2:1 (propylene oxide:embedding media) solution to the specimen vials, cap them, and place them on the clinical rotator for 1 h (see Note 4). Remove 2:1 solution from the specimen vials and dispose of it in a plastic waste container.In a chemical fume hood, prepare a 1:1 (propylene oxide:embedding media) solution, the same total volume you used with the 2:1 solution can be used here as well. Transfer 1:1 (propylene oxide:embedding media) solution to the specimen vials, cap them, and return the vials to the clinical rotator. Leave the samples on the clinical rotator overnight and store the remaining embedding media in the -20 °C freezer.The next day, dispose of the 1:1 solution in the same waste container and bring the embedding media to room temperature.In a chemical fume hood, prepare a 1:2 (propylene oxide:embedding media) solution, using the same total volume as above. Transfer 1:2 (propylene oxide:embedding media) solution to the specimen vials cap them, and place them on the clinical rotator for 1 h. Remove 1:2 solution from the specimen vials and dispose of it in the designated waste container.Transfer 100% embedding media to the specimen vials and return them to the rotator for 1 h. Remove 100% embedding media and dispose of it in the designated waste container.",
    "Transfer 100% embedding media to the specimen vials, leave the lids off, and place in a vacuum oven pressurized to 20 PSI for 1 h set to room temperature. Specimens are now ready for curing and there is no need to remove the remaining 100% media from the vials, as the specimens will be transferred directly from the vials to the mold.CuringThe viscous embedding media must be cured so that the block containing the tissue becomes hard enough for ultrathin sectioning.Set a vacuum oven to 60 °C and 0 PSI, then confirm the temperature with a thermometer before proceeding. With a pencil, write sample information on a small piece of paper that can fit into the base of the mold to be cured with the sample (will be visible through the cured plastic).Fill the individual wells of the plastic mold halfway with 100% embedding media using a wood applicator to drizzle the media into the wells of the mold.With fine negative-action tweezers, transfer the piece of paper with sample information into the bottom portion of the mold (the part that is farthest away from where the sample will rest). Next, with fine negative-action tweezers, transfer the blackened, osmicated (hard) sample from the specimen vial to the mold (see Note 5).Orient the sample accordingly to ensure that the sample can be sectioned in a cross-section or in a longitudinal section with ease (see Figure 6 for schematic on how it should look in the block). Repeat Steps E4, E5, and E6 with the remaining samples.Transfer enough 100% embedding media to fully fill the wells.Ensure that the samples are correctly oriented one last time, as adding media can distort their position slightly.Carefully, place the plastic mold into the oven to cure for at least 24 h (see Note 6).",
    "Glass knife fabrication Fabricating your own glass knives is a cost-saving technique, allowing you to preserve and extend the life of your expensive diamond knife for only cutting ultrathin sections. Pre-fabricated glass knives can be purchased if this equipment is not available at your institution.Wearing nitrile gloves, clean your glass strip (6.4 x 25 x 400 mm) with detergent and a brush and then rinse it thoroughly with tap water (see Note 7).Using a squirt bottle, rinse another time with distilled water. Leave the glass strip on paper towels to dry in a relatively clean, dust-free environment. Retract the Rear Glass Holder (Figure 2A) by rotating the Rear Glass Holder Knob (Figure 2A) and pull out the knob to lock it in place.Ensure that the Breaking Knob (Figure 2B) on the front is turned fully counterclockwise. Rotate the Locking Lever (Figure 2A) back to the rear position, fully raising the scorer.Push the Scoring Shaft (Figure 2B) all the way in. Make sure that the Score Selector (Figure 2B) above the Scoring Knob is set to.Transfer a cleaned, dry glass strip to the glass knife maker and place it flush against the White Guide Plate (Figure 2B) and then push the strip against the first Lateral Arresting Stud (Figure 2C) (used for 25 mm wide strips).While holding the glass strip in place, swing the Locking Lever gently forward until the Vertical Support Studs (Figure 2C) come into contact with the glass strip.Remove your hands and then press the Locking Lever down further until there is significant resistance.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180514/20180514184210_9935.jpgFigure 2.

    "Place the Glass Fork (Figure 2A) under the left side of the glass strip to catch your glass square.Pull the glass Scoring Shaft Knob in a swift fluid, smooth movement across the face of the glass strip until it stops to score the glass (Figure 3A). Rotate the Breaking Knob clockwise until the glass breaks, you will be able to visually and audibly sense this.Reset the Breaking Knob fully counterclockwise.Rotate the Locking Lever back to the rear position, fully raising the scorer.Push the Scoring Shaft Knob back in completely.Clean off the glass break area with a brush.Place the Dampening Pressure Adjustment Lever (Figure 2C) on the dot.Adjust the Forward and Rear Glass Holder adjustment knobs to fit the glass square.Place the square piece of glass that you just made at a 45° angle onto the Breaking Pins and leave the Glass Fork underneath the square (Figure 3B).Disengage the Rear Glass Holder Knob from Step F4 by pressing it in and then rotating it clockwise to bring the Rear Glass Holder in contact with the corner of the glass square. The glass square should sit with its corners between the forward and rear glass holders.Gently pull the Locking Lever to the forward position until the Support Studs come into contact with the glass square.Press the Locking Lever down further until there is significant resistance.Pull the Scoring Shaft Knob in a swift fluid, smooth movement across the face of the glass square until it stops to score the glass.Rotate the Dampening Pressure Adjustment Lever until the damping pad contacts the corner of glass in contact with the Front Glass Holder.Rotate the Breaking Knob clockwise until the glass breaks; you will be able to visually and audibly hear this.Reset the Breaking Knob fully counterclockwise.",
    "Rotate the Locking Lever back to the rear position, fully raising the scorer.Push the Scoring Shaft Knob back in completely.Reset the Dampening Pressure Adjustment Lever back to the dot.Rotate the Rear Glass Holder Knob counter-clockwise to retract the Rear Glass Holder away from the glass triangles and pull the knob out to lock it in place. Use the Glass Fork to lift the left and right glass knives up and out of the knife maker and place the knives in a glass knife holder. Clean off the glass break area with a brush.Repeat Steps F1-F35 to make more glass knives.To attach a plastic boat to the knife, heat some dental wax in a glass beaker on a hot plate to set to 100 °C. Once the wax has fully melted, use a wood applicator to apply wax to the edges of the plastic boat and immediately align the plastic boat onto the back of your glass knife (see Note 8). With the wood applicator, transfer more melted wax to the edges of the attached boat to seal completely (Figure 3D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180514/20180514184309_3738.jpgFigure 3.

Several glass knives without boats and one with a plastic boat attached with dental wax in the glass knife holder.Test the wax seal by transferring distilled water with a transfer pipette into the plastic boat, creating a convex meniscus of water.",
    "Leave the glass knife with the plastic boat for 5 min and then check the water level to determine if there are leaks.If leak-free, empty water and store it in your glass knife holder for future use.Trim blockTrimming the block into the trapezoidal pyramid shape enhances the thick and thin sections you are able to produce by reducing the frictional and resistive forces on your knives.Remove the plastic mold from the oven (from Step E10) and let it cool for at least 30 min.Once cool, place the plastic block with your tissue sample into the Specimen Holder (Figure 4A) that is set into the Specimen Holder Adapter (Figures 4A and 5A).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180514/20180514184604_5735.jpgFigure 4.

    "The objective is to trim the specimen block into a trapezoidal pyramid that is as small as possible while including your specimen in the center (see Note 9) (Figure 6).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180514/20180514184739_3766.jpgFigure 6. The schematic view of how to trim the blocks prior to sectioning. A. A fully cured block with an osmicated muscle sample aligned to be cut in cross-section should appear like this. From the top, looking down the osmicated muscle will look relatively less dark due to the layer of plastic between the tissue and the top of the block. Using a razor blade, the top of the block face needs to be trimmed down to expose the tissue sample. B. Initially, the trimmed layers will feature plastic only and eventually you will begin to see the black tissue in the trimmed layer with surrounding plastic once the tissue is exposed. Next, trim the plastic around the sample block to create a trapezoidal pyramid. The sample block is now ready to be faced using a glass knife.While looking through the Wide-Field Binocular Eyepieces (Figure 5B) and using a razor blade, trim the face of the block until you bring your sample into plane. You should see the lighter-colored resin and then the dark shadow of your sample in the trimmed slices that you are creating. Next, while looking through the Wide-Field Binocular Eyepieces, use a razor blade to remove excess resin from all four sides of the block around your sample to sculpt your pyramid. Unclamp the Specimen Holder from the Adapter, place the Specimen Holder onto the Specimen Arm (Figures 5C and 5D) of the ultramicrotome and use the screw to secure the Specimen Holder tightly into place.",
    "Unclamp and remove the Specimen Holder Adapter, place your Knife Holder (Figures 4C and 5B) onto the ultramicrotome stage, and clamp the Knife Holder into place. Make sure that the Clearance Angle Adjustment Knob (Figure 4C) is adjusted to the proper clearance angle, which should correspond to the angle written on the box that came with your diamond knife (6°).Use the Knife Clamping Screw (Figure 4C) to clamp a glass knife onto the Knife Holder.Use the East-West Stage Control Knob (Figure 5C) and the North-South Knife Feed Knob (Figure 5B) to bring the knife holder with your glass knife close to your block, without touching. Adjust your Specimen Holder so that the leading edge of your sample (the part that is cut first and the base of your pyramid) is parallel with the knife edge. Using the North-South Knife Feed Knob on the ultramicrotome, slowly bring the glass knife closer to the sample block. Your ultramicrotome is equipped with a light that shines up from the base, illuminating the gap between the knife and the block face. As you bring the knife closer to the block face, this illuminated area will dim more and more, signifying that the two surfaces are almost touching. Set the Manual Fine-Feed Knife Control Knob (Figure 5C) to 1 μm.While looking through the Wide-Field Binocular Eyepieces, rotate the Manual Fine-Feed Knife Control Knob to advance the sample to the knife edge while rotating the Handwheel (Figure 5D) for the Specimen Arm for a full cycle. Repeat Step G17 until you begin to see sections of the sample face coming off onto the edge of the glass knife and then continue until the full face of your sample is being sectioned.Now, the face is trimmed, smooth, and ready for thick sections.",
    "Use the North-South Knife Feed Knob to move the Knife Holder away from your sample. Unscrew the Knife Clamping Screw to loosen your glass knife and remove from the Knife Holder.Cut thick sectionsThe purpose of cutting thick sections and then staining them is to confirm the orientation of the tissue sample before proceeding.Following Recipe 6, prepare the 1% toluidine blue stain. Turn on a hot plate to approximately 100 °C. Place a glass knife with a plastic boat and tighten the Knife Clamping Screw (Figure 4C) to clamp the knife into place. Use the East-West Stage Control Knob (Figure 5C) and the North-South Knife Feed Knob (Figure 5B) to bring the knife holder with your glass knife close to your block, without touching. Adjust your Specimen Holder (Figure 5D) so that the leading edge of your sample (the part that is cut first and the base of your pyramid) is parallel with the knife edge. Using the North-South Knife Feed Knob on the ultramicrotome, slowly bring the glass knife closer to the sample block. Your ultramicrotome is equipped with a light that shines up from the base, illuminating the gap between the knife and the block face. As you bring the knife closer to the block face, this illuminated area will dim more and more, signifying that the two surfaces are almost touching. Fill the plastic boat with distilled water until the water is convex. Place the Suction Syringe (Figure 5D) into the boat beneath the water line. While looking through the Wide-Field Binocular Eyepieces (Figure 5B), use the Suction Knob (Figure 5D) to adjust the water level until you see an even silver reflection over the surface of the water (see Notes 10 and 11) (Figure 7).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180514/20180514185025_8198.jpgFigure 7.",
    "Views through binocular lens showing proper water level in the diamond knife prior to sectioning. The convex surface of water overfilling the diamond knife boat (A). Using the ultramicrotome syringe, the water level is lowered until there is a silvery, reflective surface as shown (B). After lowering the water and attempting to cut sections, if any water collects on the face of the block, the water may need to be lowered slightly further as shown (B), where you can see a slight shadow forming at the knife edge. However, if the water is lowered too much, it will pull away from the knife edge and will need to be refilled.Set the Manual Fine-Feed Knife Control Knob (Figure 5C) to 1 μm.While looking through the Wide-Field Binocular Eyepieces, rotate the Manual Fine-Feed Knife Control Knob to advance the sample to the knife edge while rotating the Handwheel for the Specimen Arm (Figure 5D) for a full cycle. Repeat Step H17 until you begin to see sections of the sample face coming off the edge of the glass knife onto the surface of the water and then continue until the full face of your sample is being sectioned (see Note 12).Once you get a full-faced section, use a metal loop to fish out the part-sections and the full section you just cut and discard them by rotating the metal loop in a beaker of distilled water. Set the Manual Fine-Feed Knife Control Knob to 0.5 μm. While looking through the Wide-Field Binocular Eyepieces, rotate the Manual Fine-Feed Knife Control Knob to advance the sample to the knife edge while rotating the Handwheel for the Specimen Arm for a full cycle. Discard the first couple of sections into the beaker of water. Cut 5-10 more 0.5 μm sections.",
    "Label two glass slides with the pertinent sample information and apply a drop (~2 cm diameter) of distilled water to the slide. Use the metal loop to transfer individual sections to the drop of water on the glass slide and rotate the loop to transfer. After you finish distributing the sections between the two glass slides, place the glass slides onto the hot plate (see Note 13).After the water has fully evaporated, the sections are ready to be stained. While the slides are still on the hot plate, add 1% toluidine blue stain drop-wise to completely cover the dried sections and leave for 2 min (see Note 14). Wash the slides with running water to remove as much excess stain from the slides as possible and allow them to dry.After allowing the slides to dry, view the sections with a light microscope (see Notes 15 and 16). If satisfied with the orientation of the sections, then no adjustment is necessary and you can move on to cutting thin sections.Use the North-South Knife Feed Knob to move the Knife Holder away from your sample. Unscrew the Knife Clamping Screw to loosen your glass knife and remove it from the Knife Holder.Cut thin sectionsIn order to form a high-resolution image, the electron beam must be able to penetrate the section without a significant loss of speed, requiring an ultrathin section.Place a diamond knife onto the Knife Holder (Figure 5B) and tighten the Knife Clamping Screw (Figure 4C) to clamp the knife into place. Use the East-West Stage Control Knob (Figure 5C) and the North-South Knife Feed Knob (Figure 5B) to bring the knife holder with your glass knife close to your block, without touching.",

While looking through the Wide-Field Binocular Eyepieces (Figure 5B), use the Suction Knob (Figure 5D) to adjust the water level until you see an even silver reflection over the surface of the water (Figure 7).Set the Manual Fine-Feed Knife Control Knob (Figure 5C) to 0.5 µm.While looking through the Wide-Field Binocular Eyepieces, rotate the Manual Fine-Feed Knife Control Knob to advance the sample to the knife edge while rotating the Handwheel for the Specimen Arm (Figure 5D) for a full cycle. Repeat Step I9 until you begin to see sections of the sample face coming off the edge of the glass knife onto the surface of the water and then continue until the full face of your sample is being sectioned (see Note 17). Once you get a full-faced section, use a metal loop to fish out the part-sections and the full-faced section you just cut and discard by rotating the metal loop in a beaker of distilled water.",
    "Next, on the power supply, set the value on the Semi-Thin Sectioning Control (Figure 5A) to 0.50 μm. On the power supply, adjust the Cutting Speed Control (Figure 5A) to 1.0 mm/sec (this corresponds to the speed that the ultramicrotome arm uses on the down stroke).Press down on the Motor Drive Control Lever (Figure 5D) that begins the automated advancement and rotation of the Specimen Arm. Look through the Wide-Field Binocular Eyepieces and observe the full-faced sections coming off the knife (see Note 18). After 3-4 sections, look through the Wide-Field Binocular Eyepieces and once the Specimen Arm completes its down stroke sending a new section into the boat, adjust the Semi-Thin Sectioning Control to 0.40 µm.Use a metal loop to fish out the sections you just cut and discard them by rotating the metal loop in a beaker of distilled water.

    "Use the negative-action forceps to pick up a copper grid with your dominant hand and place the eyelash manipulator tool in your non-dominant hand. While looking through the Wide-Field Binocular Eyepieces, bring these tools into view. Submerge the grid under the surface of the water and begin to advance it directly under your section of choice (see Note 20). At the same time, slightly submerge your eyelash manipulator tool next to your section of choice and gently guide the section over your grid. Hold the section in place as best as you can and slowly raise the grid beneath the section until the section rests relatively centered on top of the grid and remove from the water. With your section-mounted grid still resting in the forceps, take a triangle of filter paper and gently lower it next to the outer rim of the grid. Water should begin transferring from the grid to the filter paper (see Note 21). After the water is removed as best that you can, place the grid into the grid box. Continue collecting sections from the boat of your diamond knife, typically 10 grids for each sample is plenty.Allow grids to fully dry in your grid box overnight prior to staining.Stain gridsStaining the sections with uranyl acetate and lead citrate enhances the contrast for countless cellular structures.Turn on a hot plate/stirrer and adjust the temperature to ~200 °C.

After 5 min, use negative-action forceps to pick up the grid and then dunk the grid into one of the 50 ml beakers filled with previously boiled, distilled water. Dunk the grid into and out of the water ~30 times.Advance to the next 50 ml beaker filled with boiled, distilled water and dunk the grid into and out of the water ~30 times (use these same two beakers for subsequent lead citrate washes).Set the negative-action forceps onto the benchtop and apply a triangle of filter paper gently to the outer rim of the copper grid to remove water from the surface of the grid. Transfer the grid back into the grid box and allow it to dry for at least a couple of hours prior to viewing in the electron microscope.Capturing images with the transmission electron microscopeThe goal of imaging with the transmission electron microscope is to provide high-resolution images of skeletal muscle and mitochondrial ultrastructure in an unbiased manner, taking enough images to get a true sense of the microanatomy.Press the Panel On-Off Knob (Figure 9D) to illuminate the screen displaying the microscope settings.",
    "Press the HT (High Tension) button (Figure 9D) where a green light above the button will illuminate and check the emission gauge to ensure that this returns closer to ~0 before proceeding. Turn the Filament Knob (Figure 9D) clockwise ~23 steps with associated clicks as you turn the knob to reach saturation. This will take approximately 2 min and the scope will beep when this occurs. The viewing screen of the microscope should be illuminated in bright green light (see Note 26). Remove the Specimen Holder (Figure 9B) from the microscope by rotating the holder approximately a quarter turn clockwise and then pull it out completely.Place the Specimen Holder onto the Specimen Holder Stand (Figure 9F) and use the clip tool to raise the specimen clip at the end of the Specimen Holder (see Note 27).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180514/20180514185854_6722.jpgFigure 9. Phillips CM10 Transmission Electron Microscope. A and B. A general overview of the electron microscope and its parts. C. The left control panel is mainly used to control the intensity of the electron beam and for adjusting the screens for focusing images with the objective lenses or capturing images by lifting the fluorescent screen. D. The right control panel houses most of the functions needed for adjusting magnification, focusing, and the screen for monitoring the electron microscope system as a whole. E. The vacuum screen shows a schematic of the vacuum system with the various pumps, valves, and pressure gauges used to monitor the performance of the system. F. The specimen holder on the specimen holder stand with the clip opening tool inserted and the grid clip lifted.",
    "Use the negative-action forceps to pick up and transfer your grid from the grid box to the circular grid holder at the bottom of the Specimen Holder, ensuring that the grid rests completely within the area and is not resting slightly outside. Use the clip tool to lower the clip down onto your grid, holding the grid in place. Insert the Specimen Holder halfway into the scope and stop. A red Pre-vacuum Indicator Light (Figure 9B) will turn on and you will hear the pre-vacuum click on.Wait for the red Pre-vacuum Indicator Light to go out and then continue to insert the Specimen Holder fully into the high vacuum chamber by gently rotating the holder counter-clockwise and the vacuum will literally pull the specimen holder in (see Note 28). The grid will now be in view on the viewing screen with a low magnification.Move around your viewing area to find your sample area of interest by rotating the two grips (-x and -y) (Figure 9C). Once in the desired area, increase the magnification with the Magnification Knob (Figure 9D). The screen will display your current level of magnification. As you zoom in, you will have to adjust the viewing area with the two grips to keep it centered as much as possible. After the magnification is increased to ~500x, there will be an audible beep prompting you to flip the Condenser Aperture Lever (Figure 9B), switching from the low magnification aperture to high magnification. As you continue to increase the magnification, the muscle section will begin to come into view; however, the screen will get darker and darker because you have not increased the intensity of the electron beam (see Note 29).",
    "As you zoom in, gently adjust the electron beam intensity by rotating the Intensity Knob (Figure 9C) so that you can see the muscle ultrastructure clearly. Bring the muscle ultrastructure into focus with the Focus Knob (Figure 9D). Turn on the computer monitor and click on the AMT software icon.Before switching on the software and lifting the viewing screen, as a rule of thumb, adjust the intensity of the electron beam to 0.500, which is displayed on the screen next to ‘meter’ (see Note 30). Lift the Fluorescent Screen (Figure 9C) using the lever and click on ‘Click for Live Image’, a gray-scale image of your sample will appear on the monitor (See Note 31). The software is automatically set to ‘QualityLive’ and is in ‘Survey’ mode. If you want to adjust the focus slightly better, click on the ‘Focus’ button that is under the ‘Survey’ button in the software, which will zoom in the image allowing you to get a finer focus. Click the ‘Survey’ button to return to the preview screen.If satisfied, click on ‘Final Image’.Name your image with the relevant information and save the image in a designated folder. Once finished taking images, close the software and lower the Fluorescent Screen using the lever.Decrease your zoom with the magnification knob, while rotating the electron beam intensity counter-clockwise to compensate.An audible beep ~500x will prompt you to flip the Condenser Aperture Lever from the high magnification aperture back to the low magnification one.Continue to decrease the magnification to ~75x and then re-center the viewing area with the -x and -y axis grips.Remove the Specimen Holder from the high vacuum chamber and remove your grid.",
    "Place the specimen holder back into the high vacuum chamber exactly as was described above, waiting for the pre-vacuum to kick off before inserting fully. Rotate the filament knob counter-clockwise until the viewing screen is no longer illuminated and there will be an audible beep. Depress the high-tension button and the green light will go off. Pull out the panel dim knob to turn off the screen."
