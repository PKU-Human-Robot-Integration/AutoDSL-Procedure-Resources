    "Preparation of the pre-culture (to be used for all subsequent culture conditions) Day 0 Streak bacterial strains from -80 °C glycerol stock [equal to 87% (v/v) glycerol in LB] on LB agar plates for single colonies. Use LB agar plates containing appropriates antibiotics, if required, and incubate overnight at 37 °C (approximately 16 to 24 h). Day 1   Take one bacterial colony and inoculate in 10 ml liquid LB medium (in a 50 ml Falcon tube).   Incubate the culture overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 150 rpm. Put the lid loose on the tube. Add appropriate antibiotics, if required.      Preparation of inoculum Day 2   Measure the optical density of the 1:10 diluted pre-culture in a spectrophotometer and calculate the optical density of the pre-culture. Adjust the OD600 of the pre-culture to OD600=1 for a 1 ml volume which corresponds to approximately 5 x 108 CFU.   Add 100 μl of the adjusted pre-culture to 10 ml LB medium (1:100 dilution).       Culture conditions  Standard growth condition to logarithmic and stationary phase in LB medium Add 100 µl of wild type, normalized test and control inoculum to 10 ml LB medium in a 50 ml Falcon tube (a 1:100 dilution of the inoculum). Add appropriate antibiotics and inducer if required.   Logarithmic phase growth condition    Incubate the samples for 3 h at 37 °C with shaking at 150 rpm. Put the lid loose on the tube. The OD600 will be approximately 0.6-0.8.   Normalize each sample to OD600 = 0.6. Shear off flagella as described under D.     Stationary phase growth condition    Incubate the samples for 16 to 24 h at 37 °C with shaking at 150 rpm. Put the lid loose on the tube.   Normalize each sample to OD600 = 0.6. Shear off flagella as described under D.      S.",
    "Typhimurium cell culture invasion condition   Low oxygen, high salt growth condition.    Add 100 µl wild type, normalized test and control inoculum to 10 ml LB medium with high salt concentration in a 50 ml Falcon tube (a 1:100 dilution of the inoculum). Add appropriate antibiotics and inducer, if required.   Incubate the samples at 37 °C with shaking at 150 rpm until OD600 = 0.6-0.7 (takes approximately 4.5 h). Put the lid loose on the tube.   Normalize the OD600 of the samples to the wild type OD600 using LB medium with high salt concentration. Shear off flagella as described under D.        Shearing off cell-associated flagellin (flagella)   Perform the following steps on ice.   Place 5 ml of each normalized sample in an individual sterile petri dish plate.   Lift the inoculum up from the sterile petri dish plate with a sterile Luer lock tip (syringe). Place the sterile needle on the Luer lock tip and eject the cell suspension back in the petri dish plate. Work on a clean bench as this procedure creates aerosol.   Repeat the previous step 10 times with the same material to shear off cell-associated flagella.   Take 1 ml of cell suspension and transfer to an Eppendorf tube. Centrifuge at 17,700 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.   Transfer 800 µl of the supernatant to a new Eppendorf tube. The supernatant contains sheared-off flagella and minor amounts of secreted flagellin. Proceed with E, for flagellar preparation.   Remove the rest of the supernatant. The bacterial pellet is used for analysis of cell-associated protein as described under E, for cell associated protein preparation.      Sample preparation   For flagellar preparation   Centrifuge at 17,700 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.   Transfer 750 µl to a new Eppendorf tube.   Add 250 μl of cold trichloroacetic acid solution and mix gently.",
    "Place the sample for at least 1 h on ice or in a -20 °C freezer.   Centrifuge at 17,700 x g for 40 min at 4 °C, remove the supernatant and remove the residual liquid (eventually through repeated centrifugation).    For cell associated protein preparation   Centrifuge 17,700 x g for 1 min at 4 °C.    Discard the rest of the supernatant and save the bacterial pellet.     Preparation of cell associated protein and flagellin samples for loading on protein gel   Prepare the sample buffer with 90 (v/v)% 1x SDS sample pre-buffer and 10 (v/v)% β-mercaptoethanol.   Resuspend the flagellar protein preparation in 45 μl sample buffer and 5 μl Tris-HCl (pH = 9).   Resuspend the bacterial pellet in 100 μl sample buffer.   Vortex the samples.   Heat up the samples 5 min at 95 °C.   Vortex the samples.   Spin down with a microcentrifuge for few seconds. The samples can be used immediately or stored at -20 °C for further utilization."
