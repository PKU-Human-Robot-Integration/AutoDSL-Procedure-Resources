    "1. Simulator setup\nPrior to all procedures, assemble the simulator as shown in Figure 1 and turn on. Refer to Table 1 for the full list of simulator equipment needed to complete each simulation.\nSelect the patient scenario using the software interface on the attached laptop (Figure 1C).\nSelect the appropriate arterial sheath or guide catheter from the drop-down menu. This does not need to be physically inserted as part of the simulation, but will act as the femoral access site and allow subsequent entry of wires and catheters into the system (Figure 1D). Specific sheath/guide sizes for each scenario are discussed below.\nSelect the appropriate catheter(s), guidewire, and/or microsystem based on the specific scenario as discussed below (Figure 1D).\nTurn on A (PA) and B plane (lateral) fluoroscopy on the software interface. Activate the fluoroscopy with the foot pedals (Figure 1H) and adjust both the patient and image intensifier positions with the joysticks (Figure 1I) until the correct PA and lateral views are obtained.\n2. First patient scenario: Four-vessel angiography\nNOTE: This scenario depicts a 52-year-old male with an unruptured left carotid terminus aneurysm found incidentally on a non-contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the head.\nSelect a 5-French femoral sheath, a 0.035 in guidewire, and a 4-French diagnostic catheter from the drop-down menu as tools to be used in this simulation.\nInsert the guidewire into the simulator machine (Figure 1D) until it registers on the simulation screen, signaling that access has been gained. Advance the guidewire until it is visualized in the descending thoracic aorta and continues into the aortic arch.\nWhen the guidewire is safely in the aortic arch, hold the guidewire in place and insert a diagnostic catheter over the guidewire through the simulated femoral sheath to the aortic arch.",
    "Remove the guidewire and utilize the fluoroscopy puff technique by gently pressing the contrast syringe (Figure 1E) to simulate contrast injection and briefly opacify the vessels as the catheter is advanced into the desired artery.\nNext, create a roadmap guide injecting contrast with the contrast syringe (Figure 1E) while the fluoroscopy foot pedal is depressed (Figure 1H). Next, reinsert the wire to selectively catheterize the desired vessel, advancing the catheter over the wire. Remove the wire for subsequent angiography runs. The right and left internal and external carotid arteries and the right and left vertebral arteries are all catheterized using this technique.\nUsing the diagnostic catheter and the simulator contrast syringe (Figure 1E), perform angiograms of each of the above circulations by depressing the fluoroscopy pedal (Figure 1H) while injecting contrast with the syringe. Obtain high-magnification views of the aneurysm, if necessary. Review angiograms for adequacy prior to removing the catheter.\nOnce the necessary images are obtained, remove the diagnostic catheter/guidewire from the simulation sheath. Simulated closure of the femoral arteriotomy site is not performed.\n3. Second patient scenario: Carotid terminus aneurysm coiling\nNOTE: This scenario depicts a 52-year-old male with a known ruptured left carotid terminus aneurysm, severe headache, nonfocal exam, and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 15.\nSelect a 6-French guide catheter, 0.035 in guidewire, and a 4-French diagnostic catheter, from the drop-down menu.\nInsert a diagnostic catheter over a guidewire into the aortic arch as in steps 2.2–2.3.\nInsert a guide catheter over the diagnostic catheter through the femoral access site (Figure 1D) to the aortic arch.\nRemove the guidewire and create a roadmap guide of the left common carotid artery by roadmap flourscopy foot pedal injecting contrast with the contrast syringe (Figure 1E) while the fluoroscopy foot pedal (Figure 1H) is depressed.",
    "Reinsert the guidewire and selectively catheterize the left common carotid artery and internal carotid artery using fluoroscopy and the roadmap overlay visualized on the image projection monitor (Figure 1B) by leading with the guidewire and advancing the diagnostic catheter and guide catheter once safe access is gained.\nWhen the guide catheter is within the internal carotid artery, remove the diagnostic catheter and wire and perform angiographic runs of the left internal carotid cerebral circulation by depressing the fluoroscopy pedal (Figure 1H) while injecting contrast with the syringe (Figure 1E).\nMeasure the aneurysm using the calculation option on the software interface (Figure 1C). Keeping in mind that the coil diameter for the first coil should be 1 mm wider than the mean aneurysm diameter, select an appropriate coil.\nSelect a microcatheter and microwire from the drop-down menu.\nInsert the microcatheter and microwire through the femoral access site (Figure 1D), and under roadmap guidance obtained as in step 3.6, selectively catheterize the aneurysm with the microsystem.\nRemove the microwire, insert the previously selected coil through the femoral access site (Figure 1D), and advance it slowly into the aneurysm.\nOnce the coil is fully inserted, perform a diagnostic cerebral angiogram by depressing the fluoroscopy pedal (Figure 1H) while injecting contrast with the syringe and assess the patency of the parent artery and aneurysm filling. The goal is to maintain patency of the parent artery and either completely embolize the aneurysm or provide sufficient coverage of the dome or presumed rupture point to appropriately reduce rupture risk.\nDetach the coil on the software interface (Figure 1C) and remove the coil wire. If necessary, repeat steps 3.11 and 3.12 with additional coils until ~30% aneurysm occlusion is obtained.",
    "Remove the microcatheter and guide catheter from the simulation sheath site (Figure 1D). Simulated closure of the femoral arteriotomy site is not performed.\n4. Third patient scenario: Left middle cerebral artery thrombectomy\nNOTE: This scenario depicts a 64-year-old female with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of 12 for aphasia and right-sided weakness who was last known to be normal 4 h earlier. Head CT revealed a hyperdense left middle cerebral artery (MCA) sign and an Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (ASPECTS) of 10, but no hemorrhage. A CT angiogram demonstrated a left M1 segment complete occlusion.\nSelect a 6-French guide catheter,  0.035 in guidewire, and a 4-French diagnostic catheter, from the drop-down menu.\nInsert the guide catheter into the left internal carotid artery and perform angiographic runs of the left internal carotid cerebral circulation as described in steps 3.2–3.6.\nSelect a microcatheter/microwire and a stent retriever device from the drop down menu. \nInsert the microcatheter and microwire into the simulated femoral access site (Figure 1D) and into the left internal carotid artery.\nUnder roadmap guidance obtained as in step 3.5, advance the microwire and microcatheter into the left MCA and carefully past the area of occlusion. Potential complications during this maneuver include vascular perforations and/or embolizing a clot downstream.\nRemove the microwire and insert a stent retriever device into the simulated femoral access site (Figure 1D) and advance into the MCA distal to the occlusion. Then, remove the microcatheter, leaving the stent retriever in place at the level of the occlusion.\nTurn on simulated aspiration on the software interface (Figure 1C), and retract the stent retriever device into the guide catheter by pulling back on the microwire.\nRemove both the stent retriever from the simulated femoral access site (Figure 1D).",
    "Perform an angiogram through the guide catheter by depressing the fluoroscopy pedal (Figure 1H) while injecting contrast with the syringe to ensure removal of the occlusion.\nRemove the guide catheter from the simulation sheath site (Figure 1D). Simulated closure of the femoral arteriotomy site is not performed.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
