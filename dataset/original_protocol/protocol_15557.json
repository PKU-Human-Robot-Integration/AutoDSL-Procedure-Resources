    "All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Virginia and conformed to the guideline on Use of Animals from the National Institute of Health (NIH). See the Table of Materials for details related to all materials, reagents, and instruments used in this protocol.\n1. In vivo vis-OCT imaging\nThe vis-OCT system\n\t\nImage the mice eyes using a small animal vis-OCT system that uses a supercontinuum light source, which delivers visible-light illumination between 480 nm and 650 nm. Ensure that the power incident on the cornea is 1 mW and use an A-line rate of 25 kHz and an integration time of 39.3 µs per A-line.\nEnsure that the spectral detection range of the spectrometer is between 508 nm and 613 nm, which provides an axial resolution of 1.3 µm in the retina. The total imaging volume is approximately 700 µm (x) x 700 µm (y) x 1,500 µm (z). The lateral resolution is between 4.5 µm at the center of the field of view and 8.7 µm at 350 µm from the center11,13.\nMouse anesthesia\n\t\nAnesthetize mice of C57BL/6 background and either sex with an intraperitoneal injection of Ketamine (114 mg/kg) and Xylazine (17 mg/kg) cocktail and dilate their pupils using 1% tropicamide drops. Confirm adequate anesthetization by loss of pedal reflex after a firm toe pinch.\nDuring imaging, keep the mouse warm by using an infrared heat lamp. After each image acquisition, apply artificial tears to prevent corneal dehydration.\nPositioning of the mouse for imaging\n\t\nPlace the anesthetized mouse on the animal holder and keep the mouse in position with the help of two Velcro straps.",
    "NOTE: The animal holder allows movement in three dimensions (vertical adjustment, fine horizontal adjustment, as well as pitch and yaw adjustments) to place the laser into the mouse's eye.\nAdjusting imaging parameters\n\t\nTurn on the computer and open the referenced software, which will turn on the laser automatically.\nAdjust the animal holder until the laser is stable and centered into the mouse's eye. Visualize the posterior part of the eye through an En Face preview in the software interface, the field of view (FOV) of the superficial vascular plexus, and a B-scan, the cross-section of the retina within the FOV.\nAcquire a vis-OCT volume by clicking on the Acquire button on the software interface after performing minor adjustments of the optical focus, which consists of 512 A-lines/B-scan and 512 B-scans/volume.\n\t\tNOTE: This process takes ~10.5 s. Image acquisition is guided by a built-in quality index (QI) estimator to ensure that images below a predetermined threshold (QI < 45) are not included.\n\t\t\nFor each mouse, acquire four vis-OCT volumes from the same eye. Align the optic nerve head (ONH) in each of the four corners in the FOV to cover different areas of the retina.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Such placement minimizes the retinal curvature, which maximizes RNFL reflectance throughout the FOV. It requires ~1 min to reposition the eye between each acquisition (Figure 1A,B).\nVis-OCTF analysis\n\tNOTE: MATLAB is used to perform image analysis.\n\t\nTo generate vis-OCT fibergrams from the vis-OCT volume, use an intensity-based threshold method (MATLAB code line 808) to detect the surface of the retina.\n\t\tNOTE: These lines use the imadjust function to adjust the intensity values of the bscan. The [0.0087 0.08] argument passed to imadjust specifies the range of intensities to map to the full dynamic range of the output image.",
    "Crop the RNFL by selecting the first ~16 µm in depth. See Matlab code line 782.\n\t\tNOTE: The typical in vivo RNFL thickness in an adult wild-type C57BL/6 mouse is ~14 µm and can vary among different segmentation methods13.\nChange the paths of the RAW file (line 9), Files for reconstruction (line 11), and file name (line 15), click Run, and wait for the OCT image to be analyzed by the MATLAB code. Calculate the mean intensity projection along the axial (z) direction (MATLAB code lines 905-908) to generate the fibergram image composed of RGC axon bundles and surrounding vasculature. Montage the four images after fibergram processing for each FOV by aligning the blood vessels with a graphics editor of choice, covering ~1.2 x 1.2 mm in total. The RAW files are usually saved in the folder: Halo Data, under the date of OCT imaging (e.g., 0606 Opticent).\n\t\t​NOTE: The MATLAB codes are available in Supplementary File 1.\n2. Ex vivo confocal imaging\nMouse euthanasia\n\t\nAfter acquiring vis-OCT data, euthanize the mice with a mixture of pentobarbital sodium (390 mg/mL) and phenytoin sodium (50mg/mL). Phenytoin sodium functions by amplifying the effects of pentobarbital sodium, which has been widely applied in rodent euthanasia14,15. For each mouse, use 0.2 mL/20 g of the diluted mixture (156 mg/mL) and perfuse with 20 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then, 20 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS16,17.\nEye dissection and orientation\n\t\nEnucleate the eyes and make a mark on the temporal side to indicate the orientation.\nAfter carefully removing the anterior chamber, the ocular lens, vitreous, and fix the eyecups in PFA for 30 min.",
    "Wash the eyecups with PBS for 30 min, and replace the PBS solution 3x during the washing. Then, wash with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS (pH 7.5) for 30 min.\nIncubate the eyecups in blocking buffer (5% donkey serum with 2.5% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Triton X-100 in Tris-buffered saline [pH 7.5]) for 2 h at room temperature.\nImmunostaining\n\tNOTE: The eyecups are now ready to be stained with the primary antibodies of mouse anti-Tuj1 to detect RGC axon bundles and rat anti-ICAM-2 to detect blood vessels.\n\t\nIncubate the eye cups overnight with the primary antibodies, mouse anti-Tuj1 (1:200 in blocking buffer) and rat anti-ICAM-2 (1:500 in blocking buffer), at 4 °C.\nWash the eyecups 3-5x for 1 h each time, with a phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (PBST) to minimize background and remove any unbound antibody.\nAfter washing, incubate the eye cups overnight with the secondary antibodies, donkey anti-mouse Immunoglobulin G conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 dye (green fluorescence) and donkey anti-rat IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 dye (red fluorescence), all diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer, at 4 °C.\nThe following day, wash the eyecups 3-5x for 1 h each with PBST to minimize background and remove unbound antibody.\nTransfer the eyecups to a Petri dish of PBS before the flat mount.\nFlat-mounted retina\n\t\nAfter the immunostaining process, isolate the retinas from the eyecups under the microscope.\nCut the retinas into four leaves and flat mount them with the RGC layer facing up. Leave the mark on the temporal side attached to the retina to indicate orientation.\nCoverslip the retinas with mounting medium13,18. Seal the slides with nail polish13,18,19.\nConfocal imaging\n\tNOTE: The image processing of confocal images was performed using ZEN Microscopy Software.",
    "Turn on the confocal microscope, and under Locate mode, find the area of interest using the eyepiece of the microscope.\nUnder acquisition mode, set up tiles to cover the whole retina and z-stack slices to cover all layers of information. Image a least 25 tiles across the whole retina to cover the total volume of 5.99 mm (x) x 5.88 mm (y) x 30 µm (z) at a pixel size of 1.24 µm/pixel.\nProject the Z-stack slices to create two-dimensional en face confocal microscopy images (Figure 1C,D)11,13,19,20,21.\n3. Alignment of in vivo  and ex vivo images\nAfter processing the fibergram, create a composite image that includes the four images acquired from each mouse by aligning all the blood vessels with a graphics editor of choice.\n\tNOTE: On average, the final composite image is approximately 1.2 mm (x) x 1.2 mm (y), as shown in Figure 1B.\nUse the optic nerve head (ONH) and the pattern of blood vessels as landmarks to align the composite fibergram. Obtain the in vivo and ex vivo alignment by overlapping the blood vessel pattern of the composite OCT images with the confocal images of the same retina stained with ICAM-2.\nSubscription Required.
