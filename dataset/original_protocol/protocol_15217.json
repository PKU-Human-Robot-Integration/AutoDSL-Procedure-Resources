    "1. SUMO detection in fixed tissue culture cells using recombinant KmUTAG-FL SUMO-trapping protein\nGrow tissue culture cells of choice on 22 mm round cover slips in 6-well TC plates until 70%–80% confluent. Perform steps 1.2–1.8 in the 6-well plate.\nWash cells briefly with 1 mL of DPBS (Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline)\nFor fixation, prepare a fresh solution of 4% Paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution (diluted in DPBS). To fix cells, add 2 mL 4% PFA in DPBS to each well. Incubate the cells for 20 min at room temperature. NOTE: All steps using PFA should be performed in a laboratory safety hood and PFA must be disposed properly.\nWash the fixed cells 3x in 1 mL DPBS while nutating the plate, 5 min each wash.\nTo permeabilize cells, incubate for 15 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in DPBS\nWash the cells 3x in 1 mL DPBS while nutating the plate, 5 min each wash\nIncubate the cells with 500 µL of 0.1 M Glycine-HCL (pH 2.0) for 10 s, then neutralize pH immediately with 500 µL of 10x SUMO Protease Buffer (SPB).\nWash the cells 3x in 1 mL DPBS while nutating plate, 5 min each wash\nRemove the coverslips from the well and place them in a humidity chamber. Then proceed with incubations on the coverslip as follows:\n\t\nFor UTAG-fl staining only: mix 1 µg UTAG-fl with 100 µL of 1x SPB containing 5 mM TCEP in a tube, pipette the mix onto the cells on the coverslip, and incubate at room temperature for 1 h in the humidity chamber.\nOptionally, for UTAG-FL and anti SUMO1 antibody co-staining, proceed with the following:",
    "Mix in a tube 1 µg UTAG-FL and 0.5 µL SUMO2/3 8A2 (obtained for Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank9) with 100 µL of blocking buffer, pipette the mix onto the coverslip, and incubate in room temperature for 1 h.\nWash cells on the coverslip 3 times with 200 µL DPBS, 5 min each wash.\nMix in a tube 0.5 µL anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated antibody with 100 µL Blocking buffer, pipette the mix onto the coverslip, and incubate in room temperature for 1 h.\nTo wash coverslips, pipette 200 µL DPBS on each coverslip and leave in place for 10 min. Repeat the wash 2 more times.\nRemove coverslip from the last wash and invert it onto a pre-cleaned microscopy slide with a drop of mounting medium (see Table of Materials).\nStore overnight in a -20°C freezer before viewing under the microscope. Visualize using the appropriate filter sets for DAPI (DNA), Texas Red (kmUTAG-fl), and Alexa Fluor 488 (if optional SUMO2/3 co-staining is performed).\n2. SUMO detection in fixed nematode gonads using UTAG-fl\nTransfer adult hermaphrodites to an 8 µL droplet of egg buffer14 on a plus-charged slide that has been coated with poly-L-lysine. Release gonads from the worms using 27.5 G needles. Proceed with either antibody labeling or UTAG-fl labeling.\nFor antibody labeling samples, proceed as follows:\n\t\nFreeze-crack samples in liquid nitrogen and then fix overnight in -20 °C methanol in a Coplin jar.\nAlso in Coplin jars, wash slides for 3 times in 1x PBS, then block for 20 min in PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.1% Tween 20.\nAdd 30 µL of anti-SUMO 6F2 antibody (1:10) to each slide covering the specimens. Incubate overnight in a humidity chamber at 4 °C.\n\t\tNOTE: SUMO 6F2 was obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank15.",
    "In Coplin jars, wash slides for 2 min in 1x PBS, then cover and incubate specimens with 30 µL of DyLight 488 goat-anti mouse secondary antibody (1:200) for 1.5 hours in a humidity chamber at room temperature.\nIn Coplin jars, wash slides for 2 min in 1x PBS, perform a quick dip in dH20, and then mount the slides with mounting medium (see Table of Materials).\nFor KmUTAG-fl labeling, proceed with the following:\n\t\nTo fix cells, add 1 volume of 8% PF to samples for a final concentration of 4% PF. Fix for 10 min in a humidity chamber and then quench the reaction by transferring slides to a Coplin jar containing 1x PBS with 0.1 M glycine for at least 5 min.\nIn Coplin jars, wash cells for 5 min in 1x PBS, then permeabilize the samples in 1x PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X for 10 min.\nWash in a Coplin jar for at least 5 min in 1x PBS, then add 200 µL of 0.1 M Glycine-HCl (pH = 2.0) to the samples on the slide for 10 seconds. Immediately add 200 µL of 10x SPB to neutralize the pH.\nWash the slide in 1x PBS in a Coplin jar for 5 min.\nRemove slide from wash and pipette 100 µL of 1x SPB + 5mM TCEP containing 2 µg of UTAG-fl to the nematodes on the slides, and incubate in humidity chamber for 1 h without rocking.\nReturn the slide to the Coplin jar and wash for 15 min in 1x PBS",
    "Remove the slide from the wash, use a laboratory wipe to dry around the sample, and then mount the slides with 5 µL of mounting medium (see Table of Materials). Store the slides at 4 °C. Visualize using the appropriate filter sets for DAPI (DNA), Texas Red (kmUTAG-fl), and DyLight 488 (SUMO2/3).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
