    "The experimental protocol received bioethical agreement (No. 311 from 2022) and was approved by the Bioethics Committee of the University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine Cluj-Napoca, in compliance with both national (Law No. 43 of 2014) and European (EU Directive No 63 from 2010) legislation. See the Table of Materials for details about all materials and instruments used in this protocol.\n1. Necropsy protocol\nNOTE: It is recommended that the same necropsy protocol be used for all the species presented due to easier access it is when performed2,12. The following steps represent the necropsy performed in a medium-sized dog. Adapt the steps when performing necropsies on different subjects.\nWeigh the subject and place it on the necropsy table on its left side (Figure 1A). Proceed to the external examination of the subject (by inspecting and palpation of the cutis and mucosas, noting all the changes in color, consistency, and volume).\nUse a knife (or a scalpel) and make an incision of 7 cm in the right axilla (Figure 1A).\nLocate the coxofemoral junction (Figure 1A,B). Open the capsule with a knife. Cut the ligament of the head of the femur (Figure 1B).\nUse the knife to extend the skin incision in the axilla cranial to the mandibular symphysis and caudally to the perineum (Figure 1B).\nRemove the skin with the scalpel and expose the thoracic and abdominal wall from the ventral midline to the level of the vertebral transverse processes (Figure 1B).\nWith the scalpel and forceps, create a flap through the abdominal wall, ventrocaudal to the right costal arch. Open the abdominal cavity with scissors-follow the caudal aspect of the right hypochondrium (Figure 1B).",
    "Extend the incision caudally along the right paralumbar area until the external iliac crest. Afterward, extend the incision until the pubic insertion of the linea alba.\nBriefly, examine the abdominal organs in situ (by noting any changes in changes in color, consistency, volume, and position of the organs).\nWith the scalpel and forceps, puncture the diaphragm at the highest point (Figure 1B).\nEnter the thoracic cavity by removing the right rib cage with two longitudinal sections using bone-cutting forceps. Section the parasternal cartilaginous segment of the ribs. Next, section the dorsal segment of the ribs, proximal to the costovertebral joints (Figure 1C).\nExamine the heart in situ (Figure 1C). Notice the size, position, color, connections with the adjacent tissues, and by palpation, any changes in the consistency9.\n\tNOTE: If a thrombosis or congenital heart disease is present, the heart must be dissected in situ (this approach allows complete examination of the large vessels).\nUse scissors to examine and open the pericardial cavity with a longitudinal section from the base to the apex of the heart. Examine the pericardial cavity and the epicardium (noting any changes in color, consistency, and volume)12.\nRelease the heart with scissors, yielding transverse sections of the aorta, pulmonary trunk, and both vena cavae. Section the superior vena cava at least 1 cm above the entrance into the right atrium to preserve the crista terminalis11,13.\nExamine the external contour of the organ, the appearance of the epicardium, the appearance of the myocardium by the transparency of the epicardium, and the external appearance of the large vessels (Figure 2A).",
    "NOTE: In general, the opening and examination of the pericardium present some differences among the species. The examination of the pericardial cavity starts with an external inspection and assessment through the transparency of the pericardium of the overall pericardial content1,2. In a cat or dog, the pericardium typically contains about 0.25 mL/kg of thin, clear, translucent to light yellow fluid9. If there are any pathologic effusions, they should be collected with a sterile syringe or vacutainer tube.\n2. Dissection protocol\nNOTE: Several necropsy techniques are used for the heart, each with several advantages. For this protocol, two of the most used techniques were chosen: 1) the \"inflow-outflow method,\" which allows a better examination of the valves and the endocardium and is a protocol used for most of the species2,11,12,16, and 2) the \"four chambers dissection\"/\"echocardiographic plane\" technique, typically used for cats or small-sized dogs1,17.\nThe \"inflow-outflow method\" for cardiac dissection2,11,12,16\nPlace the heart with the atrial face upward (Figure 2A).\nUse scissors and toothless forceps to broadly cut from the caudal vena cava along into the right atrium (Figure 2B). Continue the cut to the right auricular appendage to expose the crista terminalis/sinoatrial node (SA node). Inspect the tricuspid valve from the dorsal view.\nCut a section from the right atrium to the junction between the right ventricle and the interventricular septum (Figure 2C). Display the right atrioventricular valve.\nSection the right ventricle free wall along the interventricular septum. Continue the section until the origin of the pulmonary trunk (Figure 2C,D).\nThoroughly examine the right atrioventricular valves, including the chordae tendineae, and the papillary muscles (Figure 2D). Cut the chordae tendineae.\nPlace forceps through the pulmonary trunk and cut the trunk longitudinally (Figure 2E). Examine the pulmonary outflow tract, pulmonary trunk origin, and semilunar valves.",
    "Cut the left atrium from the pulmonary veins to the tip of the left auricle (Figure 2F). Inspect the bicuspid (mitral) valve from the dorsal view.\nPlace the heart with the interventricular septum facing downward (Figure 2F). Make a large incision in the ventricular free wall from the base of the ventricle to the cardiac apex. Display the left atrioventricular valve completely.\nCut the chordae tendineae of the cusp of the left atrioventricular valve.\nPlace forceps through the left ventricular outflow tract and use it as guidance to open the aorta (Figure 2G).\nUse saline solution to remove all the blood clots. Once all the blood clots are removed, assess and compare cardiac weight against the body mass or standard cardiac weight tables (Table 1)11,13.\nWeigh the heart.\nIf only the SA node is the point of interest, after the left ventricle examination, place the entire heart entirely in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) for 24 h, and trim the right atrium to sample the crista terminalis.\n\t\tNOTE: By this technique, the left and right ventricles can be easily appreciated. The ratio between the left and right ventricular wall thickness is 3:1, with small differences by species and breed; for the animal fetus heart, the ratio is 1:112.\n3. Sampling protocol for histology16\nWith a scalpel, make two longitudinal, parallel cuts (approximately 5 mm apart) involving the right atrium, the tricuspid valve, and the right ventricular free wall (Figure 2I)\nMake two longitudinal parallel cuts (approximately 5 mm apart) involving the left atrium, mitral valve, dorsal papillary muscle, and left ventricle (Figure 2H).\nWithin the dorsal upper-third of the heart, transversally section the base of the heart following a line, including the interventricular septum, right atrium, aorta, aortic valve, and tricuspid valve (Figure 2J).",
    "Make two longitudinal parallel cuts involving the base of the aorta and the interventricular septum (Figure 2J).\nTrim the right atrium around the crista terminalis, and provide several parallel sections oriented transversally on the longitudinal axis of the crista (approximately 3-4 mm apart) to obtain six pieces of the SA node (Figure 3, Figure 4I, and Figure 5H).\nTrim the obtained tissues in histological cassettes.\n\tNOTE: Recommended blocking protocol: step 3.1.-histological block 1 (Figure 6 shows the resulting slide from this block.), step 3.2.-histological block 2 (Figure 7 shows the resulting slide from this block), step 3.4.-histological block 3 (Figure 8 shows the resulting slide from this block), step 3.5.-histological block 4 (Figure 9 shows the resulting slide from this block).\nImmerse the tissues in 10% NBF for at least 48 h.\n4. Sampling of coronary arteries3,10,14\nUse forceps and a scalpel to dissect the coronary arteries from the cardiac paraconal groove (Figure 4K). Fix the coronary artery overnight in 10% NBF.\nIf needed, decalcify adequately in a 1:1 mixture of 8% formic acid and hydrochloric acid.\nMake multiple transverse cuts at 3 mm intervals. Place the sections in a cassette and then put the cassette in 10% NBF until embedding.\n\tNOTE: Pigs can be used as a cardiac model for humans, especially when it comes to coronary heart disease. Hence, supplementary samples and histological sections of coronary arteries are recommended3,10,14.\n5. The \"four chambers\"/\"echocardiographic plane\" dissection technique of the heart1,17\nNOTE: The four-chamber dissection technique consists of a cut from the base to the apex of the heart to obtain the standard view1. The \"four-chamber\" technique is best applied to fixed tissues.\nPlace the whole heart into 10% NBF for at least 48 h.",
    "After the heart is fixed in 10% NBF for at least 48 h (Figure 10A), place two toothless straight dissection forceps, one through the cranial cava-right atrium-tricuspid valve-right ventricle, and the second through the pulmonary vein-left atrium-mitral valve-left ventricle (Figure 10B).\nUse the space between the forceps arms as guidance for the cutting blade from the base to the apex of the heart (Figure 10C). Provide an additional longitudinal section approximately 5 mm apart from the section described in step 5.2. on the cardiac segment, which includes the aorta.\nWith a transversal incision, completely separate the cardiac base from the apex. Place each tissue segment in a histological cassette.\n\tNOTE: Recommended blocking protocol: the cardiac apex-histological block 5 (Figure 11A shows the resulting slide from this block), the cardiac base-histological block 6 (Figure 11B shows the resulting slide from this block).\nPlace the cassettes in 10% NBF until embedding. Fix all the cardiac samples in 10% NBF (more than 10 times the volume of tissue), routinely process them in paraffin wax, section at 4 µm thickness, and stain with hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&E stain) following a previously described protocol10.\n\tNOTE: If myocarditis is suspected, \"a piece of fresh heart tissue should be retained under sterile conditions with sterile surgical material and sterile sample container for microbiological and viral studies\"13.\n6. Photographic documentation\nNOTE: Photographic documentation is an optional step in the necropsy examination. However, photography and video recordings are essential to have an \"accurate documentation of normal and abnormal anatomy\"3.\nFor proper photographic documentation, take digital images while performing \"progressive dissection of cardiac tissues\"13. Refer to the guidelines for photographic documentation and photograph15 the general view-anterior and posterior; a slice of the heart; and any suspected lesions.\nSubscription Required.
