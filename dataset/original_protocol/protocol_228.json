    "**REAGENT SETUP**\n**PBS** Add a BupH Phosphate Buffered Saline Pack to 100 mL of autoclaved DIW, dissolve well and make the volume up to 500 mL using autoclaved DIW. Each pack makes 500 mL of PBS at pH 7.2, which can be stored at RT for a week and at 4 ºC for up to four weeks. \n**MES** Add a BupH MES Buffered Saline Pack to 100 mL of autoclaved DIW, dissolve well and make the volume up to 500 mL using autoclaved DIW. Each pack makes 500 mL of MES at pH 4.7, which can be stored at RT for two weeks. \n**APTES** The procured APTES solution has a purity of 99%. Reconstitute in autoclaved DIW to make 2% \\(v/v) APTES just before functionalization.\n**EDC** The commercial pack contains 25 g EDC. Reconstitute in 0.1M MES buffer, pH 4.7 to make 8 mg/mL. Aliquots can be stored effectively for six months at -20 ºC.\n**SulfoNHS** The commercial pack contains 5 g SulfoNHS. Reconstitute in 0.1 M MES, pH 4.7 to make 22 mg/mL. Aliquots can be stored effectively for six months at -20 ºC. \n**Surface activation and APTES-functionalization   \\(TIMING 1 h 10 min)**\n1. Incubate each of the desired wells of 96-well CMTP with 100 μL of 1% \\(w/v) KOH for 10 min at 37 ºC and wash five times with 300 μL of DIW per well. Washing can also be performed with an automatic plate washer.  **CRITICAL STEP** KOH treatment should not be longer than 10 min as it may cause strong aberrations on the surface, thereby changing its surface properties. \n  2. Incubate the KOH-treated CMTP with 100 μL of 2% \\(v/v) APTES for 1 h at RT inside the fume cabinet. Wash the APTES-modified wells extensively with DIW \\(as described in step 1).",
    "**Antibody immobilization and BSA blocking   \\(TIMING 1 h 30 min)**\n3. Mix 5 µL each of EDC \\(8 mg/mL) SulfoNHS \\(22 mg/mL) to make 10 µL of pre-mixed EDC-SulfoNHS solution.  **CRITICAL STEP** The ratio of EDC and SulfoNHS is critical for optimum cross-linking. **? TROUBLESHOOTING**\n  4. Incubate 990 μL of anti-HFA capture antibody with 10 μL of EDC-SulfoNHS solution for 15 min at 37 ºC. \n  5. Incubate the EDC-SulfoNHS activated antibody in APTES-functionalized wells for 1 h at 37 ºC and wash five times with 300 µL of 0.1M PBS, pH 7.4.\n  6. Block the antibody-bound wells with 300 µL of 1% \\(w/v) BSA for 30 min at 37 ºC followed by extensive PBS washing \\(as mentioned in step 5).  **CRITICAL STEP** Use filtered BSA to remove any microbial or other contaminants. **? TROUBLESHOOTING**\n  \n**HFA CIA  \\(sandwich format)  \\(TIMING 2 h 25 min)**\n7. Add 100 µL of varying HFA concentrations \\(0.3 pg/mL-20 ng/mL) to different BSA-blocked wells. Incubate for 1 h at 37 ºC and wash extensively with PBS \\(as stated in step 5).\n  8. Add 100 µL of biotinylated anti-HFA antibody in each of the HFA-captured wells. Incubate for 1 h at 37 ºC and wash extensively with PBS \\(as mentioned in step 5).\n  9. Add 100 µL of streptavidin-HRP conjugate to the biotinylated anti-HFA antibody treated wells. Incubate for 20 min at 37 ºC and wash extensively with PBS \\(as mentioned in step 5). **? TROUBLESHOOTING** \n  10. Add 100 µL of working solution, formed by mixing equal parts of SuperSignal ELISA Femto Luminol/Enhancer and SuperSignal ELISA Femto Stable Peroxide Solution , to each of the CMTP wells and incubate at RT for 5 min.? TROUBLESHOOTING",
    "11. Record the chemiluminescent intensity at 425 nm in the Tecan Infinite M200 Pro microplate reader.  CRITICAL STEP The chemiluminescent intensity should always be measured immediately \\(or at a fixed time) as it is not an end-point immunoassay."
