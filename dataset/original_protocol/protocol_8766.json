    "All animal procedures were approved by the IACUC of Columbia University and applicable guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals were followed. Note: Prepare all buffers used for the ISH procedures in RNase-free or DEPC-treated water. This recommendation is not strictly necessary after ISH has been completed but it is suggested that buffers are still prepared in autoclaved double-distilled water and/or sterilized by filtering.\n1. Detection of Atf4 mRNA Localized to Cholinergic Axons in the Adult Mouse Brain using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) Followed by Immunohistochemistry\nSample preparation for paraformaldehyde-fixed frozen brain slices\n\t\nFor the following example, prepare slices from fixed frozen mouse brains.\n\t\t\nBriefly, sacrifice 9 month-old mice by anesthesia with ketamine (100 mg kg-1 body weight) and xylazine (10 mg kg-1 body weight) followed by transcardial infusion of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4).\nRemove brains and post-fix in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hrs at 4 oC.\nAfter fixation, wash samples three times in PBS and cryoprotect in 30% sucrose in PBS (pH 7.4) for 24 hrs at 4 oC.\nEmbed brains in OCT freezing compound, serially section at 20 µm on a cryostat and mount on poly-D-lysine treated microscope slides. Keep brain slices at -20 oC until use.\nRemove paraformaldehyde-fixed brain slices from freezer and air-dry for 30 min at RT.\nWash three times with 1x PBS.\nIn a fume hood, re-fix brain slices 20 min with 4% paraformaldehyde at RT.\n\t\t​NOTE: CAUTION: 4% paraformaldehyde is toxic and must be handled and discarded appropriately following safety protocols.\nWash three times with 1x PBS.\nDehydrate brain slices.\n\t\t\nPrepare 50%, 75% and 100% ethanol solutions.\nImmerse slides in 50% ethanol for 5 min at RT.\nImmerse slides in 75% ethanol for 5 min at RT.\nImmerse slides in 100% ethanol for 5 min at RT.",
    "Immerse slides in fresh 100% ethanol for 5 min at RT. Note: Alternatively, slides can be stored in 100% ethanol at -20oC up to 1 month.\nFISH assay followed by immunohistochemistry using heat-induced antigen/RNA unmasking\n\t\nBefore starting prepare all required material:\n\t\t\nHeat the hybridization oven to 40 oC and place a tray containing distilled water in the oven to create a humidified environment.\nTake a slide box and place paper towels soaked in distilled water inside to humidify the slide box. Place the slide box in the hybridization oven.\nRemove probes (both negative and target probes) from fridge and heat them in the hybridization oven for 10 min. Let the probes cool down at RT.\nEquilibrate amplification reagents AMP 1-4 (included in the Fluorescent Multiplex Reagent Kit) at RT.\nPrepare antigen retrieval solution: 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6), 0.05% Tween 20. Note: Solution can be stored at RT indefinitely and be used for future staining.\nPrepare 1x wash buffer diluting the 50x stock solution (included in the Fluorescent Multiplex Reagent Kit) in RNase-free or DEPC-treated water.\n\t\t\tNOTE: 1x wash buffer can be stored at RT for 1 month and be used for future staining. 50x wash buffer might precipitate. If so, heat 50x wash buffer at 40 oC for 10 min before preparing the 1x solution.\nRemove slides from 100% ethanol and air-dry for 5 min at RT.\nPrepare a coplin jar containing 50 ml of antigen retrieval solution. Immerse slides in antigen retrieval solution and boil them for 10 min in a microwave oven.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively place slides horizontally in a 100 mm diameter round glass dish containing 100 ml of retrieval solution.\n\t\t\nFill up a 1 L beaker with distilled water and place it in the microwave.\n\t\t\tNOTE: The water will “buffer” the heat when performing unmasking.",
    "Place the slides in antigen retrieval solution inside the microwave. Boil slides at high power for 5 min. Immediately after samples have stopped boiling, heat slides again at high power for extra 5 min.\nCool down slides at RT.\n\t\t\tNOTE: CRITICAL STEP: boiling duration and procedure should be determined by user, depending on the microwave characteristics. The faster the boiling starts the higher the chances of solution evaporation. In this case it is recommended that samples are boiled for shorter time periods more than twice to complete a total unmasking time of 10 min. On the contrary, if heating is performed at medium or low power, unmasking can be performed once for 10 min. However, if samples do not boil continuously for a total of approximately 10 min, this might result in partial unmasking of both the target RNA and protein to be detected.\nWash slides three times with 1x PBS.\nAdd 2 - 3 drops (~100 μl) of the dapB probe set to those brain slices used to assess background staining. Note: The dapB probe set targets a bacterial gene and should not recognize any mammalian RNA.\nAdd 2 - 3 drops of the targeting probe set to those brain slices used to detect the RNA of interest. Note: a probe set targeting residues 20 - 1,381 of the mouse Atf4 mRNA is used in this example.\nCover slides with parafilm to avoid probe evaporation, place them in the humidified slide box inside the hybridization oven and incubate them at 40 oC for 2 hrs.\n\t\t​NOTE: OPTIONAL: additional brain slices can be hybridized with a probe set targeting mouse Polr2A and used as positive controls.\nWash slides twice with 1x wash buffer for 2 min at RT.",

    "Wash slides three times in 1x PBS for 5 min at RT.\nAdd 100 - 200 μl of the appropriate Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody (e.g., Alexa-594 donkey anti-goat for this particular example) to the slides, cover with parafilm and incubate for 1 hr at RT.\nWash slides three times in 1x PBS for 5 min at RT.\nWash slides once with distilled water.\nMount slides with DAPI-containing mounting medium.\nVisualize brain slices under a fluorescence microscope.\n2. Detection of Atf4 mRNA Localized to Axons in Human Brain Samples using Chromogenic In Situ Hybridization (CISH) Followed by Luxol Fast Blue and Cresyl Violet Counterstaining\nSample preparation for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human brain samples\n\t\nBake slices in a dry oven at 60 oC for 1 hr.\nDeparaffinize brain slices in a fume hood.\n\t\t NOTE: CAUTION: reagents are toxic and must be handled and discarded following the appropriate security guidelines\n\t\t\nImmerse slides in xylene alternative clearing agent twice for 10 min.\nImmerse slides in 100% ethanol twice for 1 min.\nAir-dry slices 5 min at RT. Note: Alternatively samples might be dried at RT O/N but must be used within 24 hrs.\nDiaminobenzidine (DAB)-based chromogenic ISH assay followed by luxol fast blue and cresyl violet stain using heat-induced and protease-induced RNA unmasking\n\t\nBefore starting prepare required materials:\n\t\t\nHeat the hybridization oven to 40 oC and place a tray containing distilled water to create a humidified environment.\nTake a slide box and place paper towels soaked in distilled water inside to humidify the slide box. Place the slide box in the hybridization oven.",
    "Prepare 1x Pretreat 2 by diluting the 10x stock solution (included in the CISH Reagent Kit) in RNase-free or DEPC-treated water. If pretreatment is performed on a hot plate, add 100 ml of pretreat solution to a 100 mm diameter glass dish to increase the contact surface between the dish and the hot plate (if pretreatment is performed in a microwave, a coplin jar can be used instead as specified in 1.2.3). Heat solution to 100 oC and keep it boiling no longer than 30 min before submerging samples.\nHeat negative and positive probes 10 min at 40 oC and cool down at RT.\nEquilibrate amplification reagents AMP 1-6 (included in the CISH Reagent Kit) at RT.\nPrepare 1x wash buffer diluting the 50x stock solution (included in the CISH Reagent Kit) in distilled water.

    "Repeat steps 2.2.28 to 2.2.32. Perform incubations with luxol fast blue solution in 10 - 20 min steps, carefully monitoring the counterstain and the presence of RNA granules. Note: Typically, optimal counterstain is acquired in 60 - 90 min (total incubation time) but time can be shortened if it is suspected that RNA granules might be masked by the luxol fast blue stain (see Figure 2 for examples).\nIncubate slides in cresyl violet solution for 10 min at RT.\nRinse slides in distilled water.\nDip slides 5 to 10 times in 70% ethanol.\nDehydrate brain slices through 3 quick changes of 100% ethanol.\nIn a fume hood, clear brain slices by incubating twice in xylene alternative clearing agent for 2 min and a third time for 5 min at RT.\nMount brain slices in xylene-based permanent mounting medium.\nAnalyze samples under a brightfield microscope.\nSubscription Required.
