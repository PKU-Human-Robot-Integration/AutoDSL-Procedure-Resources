The lysate is now separated into 3 phases, as shown in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]. RNA partitions to the upper, aqueous phase, while DNA partitions to the interphase and proteins end up in both the lower organic phase and the interphase.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/595-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Phase separation during RNA purification protocol\nExample of the three phases that are formed after the addition of chloroform and after centrifugation (step 4). The upper, aqueous phase contains RNA and should be carefully transferred in step 5.\nNext, 600 μL of the upper aqueous phase is transferred to a new collection tube on a cooling unit, to which 900 μL ethanol is pipetted. Carefully transfer the upper, aqueous phase with a 200 μL pipet and avoid disturbance of the white interphase. Troubleshooting 1",
    "Samples are thoroughly mixed by pipetting up and down, loaded (up to 700 μL) on a RNeasy MinElute spin column and centrifuged for 15 s at 10000 × g at room temperature (18°C – 22°C). The flowthrough is discarded and loading and centrifugation repeated using the remainder of the samples.\nAfterwards, 700 μL RWT buffer is added to the column and samples are centrifuged for 15 s at 10000 × g. Flowthroughs are discarded.\n500 μL RPE buffer is pipetted onto the columns, followed by centrifugation for 15 s at 10000 × g. Again, flowthroughs are discarded.\n500 μL 80% ethanol is loaded onto the columns. Samples are centrifuged for 2 min at 10000 × g, and afterwards, the columns are placed into a new collection tube (with open lid) and dried for 5 min at full speed (16900 × g).\nFinally, the columns are placed in a new collection tube, 14 μL RNase-free water is added to the center of the column membrane, and RNA is eluted by centrifugation for 1 min at full speed (16000 × g – 21000 × g). An RNA eluate of 12 μL should be obtained. Troubleshooting 2\nTransfer 12 μL of the RNA eluate to a new collection tube on a cooling unit.",
    "Critical: To avoid degradation of RNA, create and maintain an RNase-free environment for the entire sample preparation and RNA purification procedure. Ribonucleases (RNases) are stable and active enzymes that are difficult to inactivate. Even small amounts of RNases are sufficient to degrade RNA. Do not use any plastic- or glassware without first eliminating possible RNase contamination. A proper aseptic technique should always be maintained when working with RNA. Bacteria or molds from the surface of the skin or from dusty laboratory equipment can result in inadvertent RNase contamination. Always wear gloves when working with RNA samples and keep tubes closed whenever possible. Regularly decontaminate the bench surface, glassware, plasticware, and laboratory apparatus with RNase AWAY Surface decontaminant (Cat# 7000TS1, ThermoFisher Scientific). Note that when working with chemicals, such as chloroform, a suitable lab coat, disposable gloves, protective goggles, and working in a fume hood are necessary. For more detailed information, consult the appropriate material data sheets, available from the product supplier.\nPause Point: We advise to continue directly with gDNA removal on the RNA eluate to avoid an unnecessary freeze/thaw cycle. However, the RNA eluate can be safely stored at −80°C and thawed on a cooling unit immediately before gDNA removal. Please ensure the number of freeze/thaw cycles is identical for all samples of the same project.\nNote: We recommend to isolate RNA from a maximum of 12 samples in parallel. Including more samples might hinder a fluent execution of the protocol and lead to a longer processing time per sample, possibly resulting in RNA degradation.",
    "Note: This kit is a good compromise between low input volume and high mRNA yield as determined in the Extracellular RNA Quality Control Study (unpublished work). If more input volume is available, we recommend the QIAamp ccfDNA/RNA Kit (Cat# 55184, Qiagen) that can process up to 4 mL of biofluid. As also other kits exist, we recommend doing a comparative test in your lab using your samples, including spike-in RNA controls, to determine RNA purification performance parameters, such as yield, concentration, and precision.\nGenomic DNA removal\nTiming: ∼30 min for 12 samples\nThis step describes the protocol for the removal of contaminating genomic DNA (gDNA) in total RNA samples extracted from biofluids using HL-dsDNAse (Cat# 70800-202, ArcticZymes) and 10× Reaction buffer (Cat# 66001, ArcticZymes).\nVortex the 10× Reaction buffer and flick the tube with HL-dsDNase enzyme, and spin both reagents down. Put the enzyme on a cooling block.\nCreate a reaction master mix containing HL-dsDNase and 10× reaction buffer for all samples on a cooling block. Per sample 1μL HL-dsDNase and 1.4μL 10× reaction buffer should be added in the master mix.\nFlick the tubes with the mix and spin down.\nTransfer 12 μL of each RNA sample to a 96-well plate.\nAdd 2 μL ERCC working solution c to each RNA sample in the 96-well plate.\nDistribute 2.4 μL of the mix to each spike-in supplemented RNA sample in the 96-well plate.\nSeal the 96-well plate using an adhesive PCR seal, flick the 96-well plate and spin down.\nVisually inspect whether the sample wells contain an equal volume of reaction master mix and RNA.\nPut the samples in a T100 Thermal Cycler and incubate for 10 min at 37°C, followed by 5 min at 58°C.\nImmediately put the samples on a cooling unit upon the completion of the protocol.",
    "Note: HL-dsDNase is especially developed to remove contaminating gDNA from RNA samples. The HL-dsDNase treatment of RNA does not affect the quantity of the RNA. The treatment however slightly fragments RNA. Therefore, multiple DNase treatments highly degrade RNA and are contra-indicated for downstream processes where RNA quality is essential for good performance (not for already highly fragmented exRNA). In addition, while both a single treatment and multiple treatments have an impact on qPCR measurements, conclusions of downstream RT-qPCR-based gene expression analyses do not change as long as all samples within the study are treated equally. Therefore, it is imperative that all samples undergo the same DNase treatment in order to be able to compare sample results.\nNote: This step results in 16.4 μL DNase treated and spike-in added RNA, sufficient for ∼2 library prep replicates (see step 3).\nPause Point: Store the DNase treated RNA at −80°C and thaw the RNA samples on a cooling unit immediately before the start of the library prep. Avoid multiple freeze/thaw cycles.\nmRNA: capture library preparation\nTiming: ∼4–5 days\nTheoretical background of the library preparation protocol",
    "This step explains how to convert total RNA into a sequencing-ready library of template molecules of known strand origin. The coding regions of the transcriptome are captured using the reagents provided in the Illumina TruSeq RNA Exome Library Prep kit (Cat# 20020189, Cat# 20020490, Cat# 20020183, Illumina). An overview of all steps is provided in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. The resulting library is suitable for subsequent cluster generation and sequencing. The protocol provided here is optimized to allow successful RNA sequencing of low-input biofluid samples containing fragmented RNA. In brief, modifications to the manufacturer’s manual (https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/samplepreps_truseq/truseq-rna-exome/truseq-rna-exome-reference-1000000039582-01.pdf[href=https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina-support/documents/documentation/chemistry_documentation/samplepreps_truseq/truseq-rna-exome/truseq-rna-exome-reference-1000000039582-01.pdf]) include a shorter incubation time in the fragmentation step (as RNA in biofluids is already degraded to some extent), an augmentation of the number of PCR cycles, and no pooling of samples during capture. A detailed step-by-step protocol is described below, preparation of the required consumables per step is summarized in Table 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl7]. Throughout the mRNA capture preparation protocol the following plastics are used: 96-well PCR plates and seals (Cat# SP-0074, Cat# SP-0027, Cat# SP-0028, Cat# SP-0605, ThermoFisher Scientific) and RNase/DNase-free eight-tube strips and caps (Cat# SP-0085, ThermoFisher Scientific). The time needed for each step in the protocol depends on the experience of the researcher as well as the number of samples included in the library preparation. When performing the protocol for the first time, we recommend to foresee sufficient time. The timing provided here, is an indication for 48 samples performed by a skilled lab technician.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/595-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Schematic overview of the different steps in the TruSeq RNA Exome library preparation workflow\n(A) Total RNA is used as input material for this library preparation.\n(B) The RNA is fragmented using divalent cations under elevated temperature.\n(C) cDNA is generated from the RNA fragments using random priming during first strand synthesis.",
    "(D) The second strand synthesis removes the RNA template and synthesizes a replacement strand.\n(E) During the 3’ end adenylation step a single ‘A’ nucleotide is added to the 3’ ends of the blunt fragments to prevent them from ligating to one another during the adapter ligation reaction.\n(F) During the ligation process the indexing adapters ligate to the ends of the ds cDNA, preparing them for hybridization onto a flow cell. This is followed by a PCR that is used to selectively enrich those DNA fragments that have adapter molecules on both ends and to amplify the amount of DNA in the library.\n(G) The coding regions of the transcriptome are then captured from this library using sequence-specific, biotinylated probes to create the final library. This is followed by the first capture, using streptavidin beads to capture the biotinylated probes that are hybridized to the targeted regions of interest. Two heated wash procedures remove non-specific binding from the beads. The enriched library is then eluted from the beads and prepared for a second round of hybridization. This second hybridization/capture is required to ensure high specificity of the captured regions.\n(H) Finally, the captured library is purified using AMPure XP beads and a second PCR amplification is performed to amplify the enriched DNA library for sequencing. Note that all steps before the first PCR amplification should be performed in a separate, pre-PCR-amplification room to avoid contamination with PCR products.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_595_7.csv\nVortex and spin down all buffers, indices, oligos, and beads before use.
