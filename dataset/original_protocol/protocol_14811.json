    "This protocol follows the LUMC and AMC guidelines of human research ethics committee.\n1. Surgical Procedure and Tissue Collection\nNote: Although various techniques for surgical excision of Dupuytren’s contracture exist, the current gold standard is the partial fasciectomy 15. Most patients are treated in the day-surgery clinic.\nPerform surgery under general or regional anesthesia according to patient's and anaesthesiologist's preferences and to patient’s co-morbidities. These considerations are beyond the scope of this paper. Prior to incision, touch the skin with a sharp object to verify that anesthesia is satisfactory. Use a tourniquet to facilitate surgical visualization in a bloodless field.\nAfter sterile prepping and draping, mark out the anticipated incision with a pen. Incise the skin with a scalpel under loupe magnification either longitudinally or using zigzag incisions to prevent additional contractures and also to allow for sufficient exposure.\nUsing scissor dissection, free the skin and subcutaneous layer from the underlying contracted fascia palmaris. Identify and protect the neurovascular bundle of the finger because the diseased cord can displace it toward the midline. Once the fibrotic tissue (nodule and/or cord) is outlined, excise it sharply and regionally (subtotal) using a scalpel. Perform meticulous hemostasis under tourniquet control at the end of the procedure to prevent hematoma formation.\nTo close the skin, use additional Z-plasties to obtain partial lengthening of the skin.",
    "For these studies use only the nodule part of the fibrotic cord, the most active and cellular part of the disease. Have the surgeon perform macroscopic identification. The isolated nodules in the palm of the hand are often precursors or a cord but are hardly ever resected, as they usually do not cause symptoms. The ones we resected were the nodules that were part of a cord of the contracted finger. Identify these nodules by the hard thick part of the cords in the handpalm (Figure 1A).\nOnce the surgeon removes the tissue, immediately transfer it using sterile forceps to a 50 ml tube containing DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% (P/S). Keep the tissue for a maximum of 2 hr in this medium on a box of wet ice (4 °C) (e.g., transportation of the tissue from the operation room to the cell culture facility).\nKeep the samples on wet ice (4 °C) while preparing for the next step. Preparation of the materials and cell culture chamber requires 10-20 min.\n2. Preparation of Instruments, Culture Medium and Culture Inserts\nNote: All procedures are performed at RT unless specifically stated.\nPrepare 500 ml of DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% (P/S) and filter sterilize. Prewarm the medium at 37 °C.\nAutoclave forceps, a pair of curved-bladed Mayo scissors (150-170 mm in length) and a pair of Metzenbaum scissors and store in a sterile container.\nUnder laminar flow, open a sterile 12-well culture plate. Place one culture insert (0.45 µm pore size, 12 mm diameter) in each well of the 12-well plate (Figure 1B, lower panel).",
    "Fill the 12-well plate with 600 µl of prewarmed (37 °C) culture media by pipetting on the well and not directly on the membrane of the insert. Place the plate into the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) (Figure 1B, upper panel).\n\t\nAlternatively, use a 24-well plate and add 300 µl of medium per well. The volume of medium per well is optimal when a meniscus layer is formed between the liquid and the lower part of the membrane insert.\n\t\tNote: the medium at the bottom of the well diffuses through the nitrocellulose membrane forming the meniscus layer as depicted in schemes of Figure 1B (lower panel).\n3. Tissue Preparation and Ex Vivo Tissue Culture Setup\nNote: All procedures are performed at RT unless specifically stated.\nTransfer the nodule part of the cord from the 50 ml tube on a 100 mm Petri dish and add 10 ml of prewarmed (37 °C) medium. Ensure that the tissue is in contact with the liquid during the entire procedure.\n\t\nRemove the perinodular fat layer using the Metzenbaum scissors. Discard the fat tissue. With the use of forceps and the curved-bladed scissors, cut transversally the tissue into smaller pieces (maximum thickness of 200 µm).\nTransfer the 12-well plate from the incubator into the laminar hood. Check that the membrane of the insert has turned transparent (wet) and therefore is in contact with the medium.\nUsing forceps carefully lift a tissue part by touching the outer layer (do not apply tension on the tissue). Place one tissue part onto the membrane of the cell culture insert so that the tissue remains in the air-medium interphase. Culture a maximum of two tissue parts on the same insert/ well.",
    "Ensure that the tissue is placed flat on the membrane, in longitudinal contact with the medium such that the tissue neither floats off the membrane nor is fully covered by medium. Avoid air bubbles.\n\tNote: At this stage, it is possible to add growth factors or inhibitors of interest to the media; for instance, test compounds (A, B, C, D, E) in replicates and/or in concentration curve. Include at least 2 control (untreated) pieces of tissue under normal growth conditions to ensure that the experiment has been set up properly. Incubate tissues for 3-7 days in a tissue culture incubator.\nInfect the tissue with either lentiviral or adenoviral construct if overexpression or knock down experiments of a gene-of-interest need to be performed (Figure 2). Transfer a tissue part from the 12-well plate into a 35 mm dish using forceps.\n\t\nUse a maximum volume of 10 µl of high titer virus.\nPerform the injection under a dissection microscope with an insulin syringe loaded with 50 µl PBS containing 10 µl of the selected virus. Place the needle perpendicular to the center of the tissue.\nSlowly inject the content of the syringe. Do not retract the needle directly. When puncturing the tissue, do not let the needle go through the other side but maintain the needle within the tissue itself (around the center of the tissue).\nTransfer the tissue back into the 12-well plate, close the culture plate and place it into the incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2).\n4. Whole-mount Immunofluorescence Staining and 3D Reconstruction\nNote: All procedures are performed at RT unless specifically stated. The protocol for whole mount immunostaining and imaging described below is an adaptation from previously reported methods used for other tissues 16-19. Buffers and materials are described in Table 1 and Materials List.",
    "Transfer tissues from the culture plate to 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes containing PBS. Wash 2x for 5 min in PBS solution on a rotating platform. Fix tissues in 4% buffered PFA (1.5 ml solution per tissue in 2 ml microcentrifuge tubes), O/N at 4 °C on a rotating platform.\nRemove PFA and wash 3x in PBS for 5 min each.\nDehydrate tissues by immersion in a 25% methanol solution for 2 hr at RT on a rotating platform. Increase the methanol percentage gradually (50%, 75%, 100%) with the tissues immersed at each solution for 2 hr at RT on a rotating platform.\nTransfer tissues in DMSO/methanol solution (permeabilization step) for 3 weeks at 4 °C, as described previously 18.\n\tNote: At this stage, tissues can be stored long term in 100% methanol at -20 °C.\nProceed with staining procedure 16, 17; gradually rehydrate tissues (75%-50%-25%-0% methanol series). Perform each rehydration step for 2 hr at RT or O/N at 4 °C, under constant agitation.\nIncubate samples with primary antibodies in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 20% DMSO O/N at 4 °C. Use antibodies at the following ratios using the commercial stocks in PBS: anti-α smooth muscle actin (1:500, mouse), anti-collagen type I (1:500, goat), anti-collagen type III (1:500, goat).\nWash extensively in PBS for 48 hr at 4 °C (change PBS solution 3 to 4 times).\nDilute appropriate secondary antibodies (Alexa 555 anti-mouse, Alexa 488 anti-goat) at 1:250 dilution in PBS containing 1% (BSA) and 20% DMSO. Incubate O/N at 4 °C.\nWash extensively in PBS for 48 hr at 4 °C and incubate with nuclear counterstain, TO-PRO-3 diluted 1:500 in PBS at the final washing step.",
    "Note: TO-PRO-3 is a far-red emitting DNA dye (with a He-Ne 633 nm laser line) and is combined for simultaneous imaging with other channels; in this case collagen type I / collagen type III (488 nm), α smooth muscle actin (555 nm), TO-PRO-3 (647 nm).\nTransfer the tissues to a methanol series (25%-50%-75%) to slowly dehydrate the tissue; perform each dehydration step for 2 hr at RT or O/N at 4 °C under constant agitation.\n\t\nTransfer tissues in polypropylene tubes. Clear tissues in methylsalicylate (handle under chemical hood) 18 or as an alternative use BABB solution 19. Incubate at RT under constant agitation until the tissues become transparent. Mount between a slide and a coverslip sealed with hard set mounting medium (Figure 1C, upper panel).\nImage samples on an inverted confocal microscope equipped with high NA 63X and/or 100X oil immersion objectives (Figure 1C).\n\t\nClean the lens with cleaning solution provided by the microscope manufacturer.\nApply one drop of the oil on the objective lens. Place the slide with the specimen on the microscope stage and focus on the sample.\nSet the configurations on the microscope for simultaneous imaging of three-channel fluorescence with laser lines 488 nm, 514 nm and 633 nm.\nAcquire single XY images or multiple focal plane images (Z stack) (Figure 3A). Use increased width of Z stack for performing 3D reconstruction. To obtain a high-resolution image use low scanning speed, number of average scans (≥ 3) and acquire 16-bit images of 1,024 x 1,024 pixel resolution.\nAnalyze the Z stack acquired images: first rename and save image file (xyz). Using the software program of the confocal microscope, configure a maximum intensity projection of the Z stack images into a 3D reconstructed image.",
    "Select the xyz file, in the “Process Tools”, click under “Visualisation” and “3D Projection”. Enter “Maximum” in the method of projection (or “Average” if the fluorescent signal is saturated). For a single projection do not change the X, Y, and Z planes, and apply the projection tool (Figure 3B, r1).\nUse the Z stack images to create a 3D projection with animation (confocal software) for viewing purposes. Select the xyz file, in the Process Tools, click under “Visualisation” and “3D Projection”.\n\t\nClick on “Create Movie”. Enter the Start Rotation angle in degrees (e.g., 0° as starting point of the movie, Y axis) and click on “Set Start”. Enter the End Rotation angle in degrees (Y axis) as end point of the movie (e.g., 180° or 360° for a complete rotation) and click on “Set End”.\nSelect “Maximum” as a method of projection (or “Average” if the fluorescent signal is saturated). Enter the ”Number of Frames” for the rotation of the 3D reconstruction (e.g., 20 rotations or higher to reduce the speed of rotation). Click on “Apply”. Export the movie as visual file (e.g., “avi”) (Supplementary Movie 1) or export as “tiff” file which creates an image file for each rotation angle (Figure 3B; rotation r4, r10, r18).\n5. Combined Second Harmonic Generation (Collagen) and Two-photon Excited Fluorescence (Elastin) Imaging on Ex Vivo Tissue during Culture\nNote: All procedures are performed at RT unless specifically stated.\nRemove transwell plates from incubator and place a single (unfixed) tissue part in a 35 mm cell culture plate containing 500 µl of medium.\nPosition the tissue so that the long axis is flat on the plate. Keep tissue wet at all times however, not floating.\nPlace water-immersed objective of the multiphoton microscope directly in contact with the tissue (Figure 1C).",
    "Obtain images with an excitation wavelength of 800 nm and collect emitted light between 371-425 nm (SHG, collagen) and 474-532 nm (autofluorescence, elastin) (Figure 3C). Perform two-photon microscopy in an upright confocal microscope equipped with a femtosecond laser using a 20X/1.0 NA water-immersion objective. Process confocal stacks with manufacturer’s software.\n\tNote: Excitation with a near infrared laser of collagen molecules creates high contrast imaging of native collagen structures in different depths.\nSubscription Required.
