    "Note: All procedures are performed in a tissue culture hood to prevent contaminations. Day 1: Plating PLAT-E cellsTransfectionPlate 0.5 x 106 cell/well in a 6-well plate in 2 ml complete RPMI media.  Note: At the moment of plating, cells should be 75-90% confluent. The quality of the cells will highly impinge on the transfection frequency and thereby on retroviral production for infection.B cell purificationSacrifice Aicda-/- mice and extract the spleen using sterile utensils and place into a well of a 6-well plate containing sterile PBS. Note: From here on work in the cell culture hood. A filmed example of the procedure to remove the spleen and extracting the lymphocytes by the method described in points 2-4 below has been previously published (Zaheen and Martin, 2010).Put the spleen on a 70 µm cell strainer placed on top of a 50 ml falcon. Add 1 ml complete RPMI media onto the spleen and gently press using the flat end of a 10 ml flat syringe plunger.Add complete RPMI media 1 ml at a time and continue squishing the spleen until all the cells have been extracted from the organ (should only be left with clear tissue on the strainer and lead to a final volume of 5 ml).Pipette up and down gently with a 5 ml pipette to produce a homogeneous suspension and transfer cells to a 15 ml conical tube.Introduce a sterile, long Pasteur pipette in the tube.Slowly pipette 3 ml of Lympholyte-M into the Pasteur pipette to underlay the cell suspension.Handle the tube gently to avoid disturbing the phasesCentrifuge 1,250 x g for 20 min at RT-with no break.  Note: Brake must be turned off in order to maintain the lymphocyte interphaseimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160205/20160205152736_4614.jpg Figure 3.",
    "Typical aspect of the lymphocyte-rich interphase between medium and lympholyte after centrifugationCollect the interphase using a 5 ml pipette, avoiding as much Lympholyte-M as possible. Tilt the 15 ml conical tube and place the tip of the pipette slightly on top of the interphase, touching the side of the canonical tube. Aspirate gently avoiding as much of the Lympholyte phase as possible (Figure 3).Resuspend the cells by pipetting up and down a few times in 15 ml PBS 1% BSA.Centrifuge 800 x g for 10 min at RT-break is ok now.Resuspend the cells in 15 ml PBS 1% BSA.Centrifuge 400 x g for 10 min at RT.Resuspend in 100 µl PBS 1% BSA.Add anti-CD43 microbeads. Use 20 µl per spleen. Note: Resting B cells are CD43-. Depleting the splenic cell suspension of CD43+ cells will eliminate most T and activated B cells (note that this protocol is very inefficient in extracting dendritic cells or macrophages). A typical purity of >90% naïve B cells is achieved.Incubate 45 min at 4 °C mixing gently every now and then.Add 15 ml of cold PBS 1% BSA.Centrifuge 400 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Resuspend in 1 ml MACS column buffer and pass the cells through a 40 μm cell strainer to avoid cell clumps in the AutoMACS.Proceed to AutoMACS separator and use DEPLETE program with quick washes in between samples. Note: Remember this is a depletion of activated cells (i.e., you want the cells that flow through, not the retained ones).Collect the flow through cells from the AutoMACS and wash with cold PBS 1% BSA, then centrifuge 400 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Resuspend in 1 ml complete RPMI media.Count the cells (do a 1/20 dilution in PBS and then 1/2 with trypan blue).",
    "Note: The quality of the depletion could be monitored by flow cytometry using anti-CD43 and anti-B220 markers. Typically, this procedure yields >90% pure resting B cells.Plate 106 B-cells per well in a 24-well plate in 1 ml complete RPMI media. Plate as many wells as constructs you want to test + one well as uninfected control.Add 1 ml of medium containing 0.5 μg/ml anti-CD180 (final concentrations of 0.5 x 106 B cells/ml and 0.25 μg/ml anti-CD180). Anti-CD180 antibody promotes B cell proliferation without inducing AID expression or CSR.Put cells in the tissue culture incubator.Day 3Observe the cells, B cells should start to proliferate and clump. Remove media from transfected PLAT-E cells and add 2.5 ml fresh RPMI media supplemented with 10 mM HEPES.Day 4: B cell infectionTransfer the viral supernatant from transfected PLAT-E cells to a 15 ml conical tube. Centrifuge at 200 x g, 5 min at room temperature.Transfer viral supernatant to a new tube.Adjust the concentration of viral supernatant to 20 mM HEPES and 16 μg/ml Polybrene.Remove 1 ml media from the top of each well containing B cells avoiding disturbing the cells, and add 1 ml of supplemented viral supernatant for a final concentration of 8 μg/ml Polybrene and 10 mM HEPES.Centrifuge the 24-well plate at 515 x g for 1.5 h at 30 °C.Place the plate for 4 h in the tissue culture incubator at 37 °C.After 4 h remove most of the media from each well, and add 2 ml complete RPMI media containing appropriate mitogens and cytokines as follows.",
    "For IgG1 switching: 5 μg/ml LPS + 25 ng/ml IL-4 (for saturating conditions) or 5 μg/ml LPS + 5 ng/ml (for non-saturating conditions)//For IgG3 switching: 25 μg/ml LPSFor IgG2b switching: 5 μg/ml LPS (+TGF-β1 next day, see below)Day 5: For IgG2b, add 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 (it is added 24 h after infection because it delays proliferation)Day 6: For IgG1 or IgG3, transfer cells to a 12-well plate and add 2 ml of fresh RPMI (no cytokines needed). For IgG2b leave cells alone.Day 7: Measure class switch recombination to IgG1 or IgG3 (Figure 4)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160205/20160205152754_5574.jpg Figure 4. Example of Aicda-/- B cells transduced with vector control or pMXs-AID-ires-GFP and stimulated as explained aboveDay 8: Measure class switch recombination to IgG2b if desiredMeasuring Class Switch Recombination:Resuspend the cells GENTLY and transfer 500 µl of cells into FACS tubes.Top up tube with PBS and centrifuge at 400 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.Block by incubating cells in 100 µl PBS 1% BSA containing 1:10 dilution of FcR block for 10 min at 4 °C. Add 100 µl PBS 1% BSA containing 1:100 dilution of anti-IgG1/anti-IgG3 or 1:50 dilution of anti-IgG2b. Incubate at 4 °C for 30 min.Top up the tube with cold PBS and centrifuge at 400 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Resuspend cells in 100 µl of anti-biotin-APC at 1:50 dilution in PBS 1% BSA by gently vortexing.Incubate 10 min at 4 °C in the dark.Top up the tube with cold PBS and centrifuge 400 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.Resuspend the cells in 200 µl PBS.Bring to flow cytometer.Add 5 µl of 100 µg/ml propidium iodide per tube to exclude dead cells.  Note: Infection efficiency can be affected by the AID variant used.",
    "With wild type AID in pMX-ires-GFP we typically obtain ~40-60% infection efficiency and ~20% switching to IgG1 among the GFP+ cells."
