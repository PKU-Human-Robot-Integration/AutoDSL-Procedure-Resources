    "1. Microfabrication of Patterned Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with Network Design\nWafer Fabrication to Create a Negative Template of the Network Design\nCreate a network pattern using any computer-aided design (CAD) software. Ensure that the diagonal dimension between the inlet and outlet match the distance between the inlet and outlet reservoirs on the housing devices in future steps (see 2.1.1).\n\t\tNote: The design of the pattern itself is custom depending on the specific research goals of the user (see Figure 1 for example patterns).\nGenerate a mask of the network pattern using high resolution printing or order a chrome photomask from a commercial supplier. A more detailed protocol of the photolithography process is available elsewhere 35.\nClean an 8\" silicon wafer for 5 min at 100 W with oxygen plasma treatment.\nPour enough negative photoresist (SU-8 2,100 works well) onto the wafer such that the resist forms a dollop with diameter of 2.5 cm. Using a spin coater, spin the wafer at 500 rpm with 100 rpm/sec ramp and maintain for 10 sec. Then ramp up to 1,600 rpm with 300 rpm/sec and maintain for 30 sec. Note: The speed and ramp need to be optimized for each laboratory condition to yield a resist thickness of 150 µm.\nSoft-bake the wafer at 65 °C for 7 min, ramp up to 95 °C with 360 °C/hr, and maintain for 45 min. Slowly cool down to room temperature on the hot plate. Imprint the vessel pattern onto the coated wafer by exposure to 365 nm UV light under a chrome photomask, with exposure triple that of the manufacturer's recommendation (350 mJ/cm2 for a SU-8 thickness of around 150 µm).\n\t\tNote: Since SU-8 is a negative resist, the exposed regions (everything except the pattern design) will become insoluble to the developer in step 1.1.7.",
    "Hard-bake the exposed wafer at 65 °C for 5 min and ramp up to 95 °C with 360 °C/hr and maintain for 25 min, then allow it to slowly cool down to RT on the hot plate.\nImmerse the wafer in SU-8 developer for 10 - 15 min to wash away unexposed resist, then clean with isopropyl alcohol and dry under a compressed nitrogen flow. Inspect the pattern under a light microscope to ensure the SU-8 resist is well bonded to the wafer (look for unwanted peeling and bubbles).\nMeasure the thickness of the pattern features using a profilometer according to manufacturer's instructions 36. During measurement acquisition, avoid regions of the structure that are essential for network function (i.e., inlet and outlet conduits) as a contact based profilometer could compromise the structural integrity of the patterned features on the wafer. Alternatively, use a non-contact method (i.e., optical profilometer) to avoid this issue altogether.\nGeneration of Patterned and Flat Molds for Collagen Molding\n\tNote: Handle silanes within a chemical fume hood.\n\t\nPlace the wafer in a desiccator with 100 µl of trichloro(3,3,3-trifluoropropyl)silane for 2 hr to silanize the surface.\nTransfer silanized wafer into a 120 x 120 mm square Petri dish. Pour mixed and de-gassed PDMS elastomer and curing agent (10:1 w/w ratio) over the wafer to achieve 4 - 6 mm thickness. Pour additional PDMS into a separate 120 x 120 mm square Petri dish to generate flat molds without patterns. Cure at 65 °C for 2 hr.",
    "Remove from oven and allow the PDMS to cool to room temperature. Using a scalpel carefully cut a square around the SU-8 and slowly peel off the PDMS mold from the wafer. Trim edges to 30 mm x 30 mm. For flat molds, cut cured PDMS without an imprinted pattern into square pieces about 40 mm x 40 mm.\n2. Housing Devices\nFabrication of Top and Bottom Housing Pieces\nFabricate vessel housing using poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). To fabricate, order the parts from a standard machine shop with computer numerical controlled (CNC) milling capabilities. See Figure 1 for a schematic of the top and bottom pieces.\nDesign the top housing piece (Figure 1D) to include a 20 mm x 20 mm well on the underside of the device with a depth of 1 mm, two collagen injection ports (4 mm diameters) on the top of the device located at the corners of the square well, two inlet and outlet reservoirs with 6 mm diameters, and four screw holes (3 mm diameter) at the four corners of the device.\n\t\tNote: Additional holes may be drilled on the periphery of the piece for handling purposes.\nDesign the bottom housing piece (Figure 1E) to include a square hole in the middle (dimensions 15 mm x 15 mm) with a surrounding 25 mm x 25 mm shelf with a depth of 0.25 mm. Drill 4 screw holes with 4-40 thread. Ensure the screw holes in the bottom and top pieces will align together during future assembly steps.\n3. Microvessel Device Fabrication\nPreparation of Materials",
    "Wash and autoclave two sets of tweezers, a stainless steel spatula, a small flat screw driver, stainless steel screws, and several stainless steel dowel pins. For the fabrication of the vessels, also autoclave micropatterned PDMS molds, PDMS flat squares, glass coverslips (22 x 22 mm), and cotton pieces.\nSterilize the PMMA housing pieces in bleach for at least 1 hr, then rinse with autoclaved water in the tissue culture hood twice, and allow to air dry in sterile tissue culture dishes (150 mm x 25 mm).\nSterile Polyethyleneimine-glutaraldehyde (PEI - GA) Coating\nTreat inner wells of sterilized dry PMMA pieces with plasma for approximately 1 min. Add 1% Polyethyleneimine (PEI) onto the inner wells (the 20 mm square well on the top and the 25 mm square shelf on the bottom) of the PMMA pieces for 10 min. Rinse with sterile H2O and allow to dry in the tissue culture hood.\n\t\tNote: The time needed for plasma treatment is variable depending on the device used - the PEI should spread easily indicating a hydrophilic surface. If not, additional plasma treatment may be necessary.\nApply 0.1% glutaraldehyde (GA) onto PEI treated surfaces of the PMMA pieces for 30 min. Rinse twice with sterile water and allow to dry.\n\t\tNote: In future steps, collagen will adhere to the coated surface through collagen-glutaraldehyde crosslinking. This helps secure the gel in place within the device during future assembly steps and throughout the device culture period.\nCollagen Gel Preparation\nFabricate vessels using 0.6% - 1% collagen solutions. To make 0.75% collagen for vessel fabrication, mix type I collagen stock solution (1.5% - isolated from rat tails 37) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH),10x Media Supplement (M199), and cell culture media. Keep all solutions on ice.",
    "Determine the volume of collagen by the following equation, where Vƒinal is the final volume of gel required (typically, 1 ml of collagen per device is sufficient), Vstock collagen is the volume of stock collagen needed, Cstock collagen is the concentration of the stock collagen, and Cƒinal collagen is the desired concentration of the collagen in the vessel.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54457/54457eq1.jpg\nUse a 1 ml syringe to transfer the appropriate volume of stock collagen to a new 30 ml conical tube. Determine the volumes of the neutralizing NaOH (VNaOH), M199 10x media supplement (V10X), and cell culture media (V1X) as follows and mix separately in a 15 ml conical tube:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54457/54457eq2.jpg\nAdd the mixture of neutralizing reagents (V10X, VNaOH, V1X) to the aliquoted collagen, and use a small spatula to gently mix the solution until a homogeneous gel is obtained. Avoid introducing bubbles by stirring slowly and gently.\nTo incorporate cells into the matrix at the desired concentration (e.g., 0.5 - 20 million cells/ml), add the cells to the collagen solution after it is mixed with the neutralizing reagents, and continue to stir until the cells are homogeneously distributed.\nWhen cells are added, adjust the volume of cell culture media to accommodate the additional volume, as determined by the following equation, where Vcells is the required volume of the cell suspension, Cƒinal cell density is the desired density of cells in the vessel, Csuspension cell density is the density of cells in the stock solution.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54457/54457eq3.jpg\nCollagen Injection - Top Piece\nPlace the micropatterned PDMS mold in a 100 mm x 20 mm dish. Plasma clean the PDMS mold for 1 min.",
    "Align the top PMMA piece on top of the PDMS mold so that the square reservoirs on the mold are directly under the inlet and outlet reservoirs (see Figure 1D - dashed lines). Place the stainless steel dowel pins into the inlet and outlet reservoir holes on the top PMMA piece to maintain clear access from the reservoirs to the pattern.\nUse a 1 ml syringe to extract ~ 0.5 - 0.6 ml collagen. Ensure that no bubbles remain in the syringe.\nPress down lightly with tweezers on the top housing to ensure flush contact between the top piece and the PDMS mold. Inject collagen slowly through an injection port on the top PMMA piece. Check that collagen fills in the 20 mm x 20 mm domain above the pattern and does not leak out.\nClose the dish without jostling the dowel pins and allow to gel in a 37 °C incubator for 30 min.\nCollagen Injection - Bottom Piece\nPlace a 22 x 22 mm glass coverslip in the center of the bottom piece. Use a 1 ml syringe to dispense ~ 0.25 ml collagen evenly onto the glass slide. Gently lower the PDMS flat square over the collagen, ensuring the PDMS is flat against the PMMA and there are no trapped bubbles. Allow to gel at 37 °C for 30 min.\nDevice Assembly\nAfter gelation, add enough PBS around the flat PDMS piece on the bottom piece to surround the PDMS (about 1 ml). Use tweezers to remove any excess collagen around the edges, and slowly peel off the PDMS piece. Add more PBS on top of the collagen to maintain hydration.",
    "To prepare the top piece, use tweezers to pick up the top PMMA piece and flip it over so that the PDMS mold is on top. Add a few drops of PBS to the interface, then quickly and firmly remove the PDMS mold from the top PMMA piece.\nGently remove stainless steel dowel pins from the other side of PMMA housing using another pair of tweezers. Add several more drops of PBS onto the micropatterned collagen. Flip the PMMA top piece over so that the collagen faces down and place 4 screws into the corner holes.\nGently lay the top piece on top of the bottom piece, aligning the screws with the corner holes on the bottom piece. Do not allow the two pieces to slide against each other. Use a screwdriver to tighten the screws using a gentle touch. Do not overtighten.\nAspirate the PBS surrounding the PMMA surfaces and place a small piece of cotton under one edge of the device. Using a pipette, remove any PBS from the reservoirs and replace with cell culture media. Allow the device to gel together in a 37°C incubator for at least 1 hr.\nCell Seeding\nCulture human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in endothelial growth media at 37 °C (CO2, O2) to confluency 38. Whenever possible, use between passages 4 and 7.",
    "Trypsinize endothelial cells by washing the culture flask with 6 ml of PBS and then adding 2 ml of 0.05% trypsin at 37 °C to dissociate the cells. Leave the cells in trypsin until most of the focal adhesions have detached and the cells are rounded up (this typically takes about 2 - 3 min). Stop the trypsin reaction by adding 4 ml of endothelial growth media containing fetal bovine serum (FBS). Wash the flask with the media several times to ensure the cells are detached from the flask and collect in a conical tube.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer and resuspend them at a density of 10 million cells per ml. Remove all cell culture media from the inlet and outlet reservoirs. Using a 200 µl gel loading tip, add 10 µl of cell suspension into the center of the inlet reservoir. The cells should begin to flow into the network immediately and coat the network.\nAdd 200 µl media equally to both reservoirs and let cells attach and spread within the network for at least 1 hr.\nDevice Culture\nCulture the device with gravity driven flow through the network by adding 200 µl of cell culture media to the inlet reservoir and 50 µl to the outlet reservoir. With this method of culture, replace media every 12 hr to maintain endothelial viability.\n\t\tNote: If continuous flow culture conditions are desirable (to maintain constant shear stress, collect media at the outlet, etc.) a syringe pump may be used instead of gravity driven culture.\nAllow the seeded endothelial cells at least 24 hr to attach and stabilize before applying continuous flow. Prior to continuous flow setup, maintain the devices with gravity driven flow conditions.",
    "NOTE: The media conditions for applied flow differ from gravity driven culture. The addition of a plasma expander, such as dextran, to the media stabilizes the engineered microvessels and prevents vascular collapse during sustained perfusion 39.\nTo make media for continuous flow setup, dissolve 3.5% Dextran (70 kDa) in endothelial growth media for optimal vessel culture. Using sterile technique, fill 10 ml syringes with endothelial growth media with 3.5% Dextran.\nPrepare a sterile culture dish for flow by melting holes in the side wall of a Petri dish using a soldering iron.\nAttach 12\" silicon tubing (1/32\" ID) to a Luer lock coupling (Female, 1/16\" ID), and a 1/16\" straight tube-to-tube connector with a 1\" segment of tubing on the other end. Insert a 1/4\" 20G blunt needle (detached from the needle hub) to the free end of the 1\" segment. Also prepare a 3\" segment of tubing attached to a tube-to-tube 90° elbow connector joint (to be fitted in the housing inlet). In subsequent steps, the longer tubing will be threaded through the prepared dish and attached to the 3\" segment via the 20 G needle. Outlet tubing should mirror inlet tubing, with a free end instead of a Luer lock coupling. Autoclave all segments prior to use.\nThread autoclaved inlet and outlet tubing through holes in the prepared dish. Attach 3\" segments to inner 20 G needles. Attach the Luer lock coupling to the media-filled syringe and perfuse media through the tubing using the syringe pump set at a high flow rate. Ensure that there are no bubbles in the tubing or connectors, as these will impede flow to the vessel.\nInsert the connector joint into the housing inlet. Set the syringe pump to the desired flow rate and begin perfusion.",
    "NOTE: This can be adjusted depending on the vessel geometry and experimental conditions of applied shear stresses. For a 100 µm diameter channel, a flow rate of 3 µl/min works well.\nIf desired, collect perfusate with prepared outlet tubing inserted into a sterile 5 ml polystyrene round bottom tube containing 500 µl of media.\n\t\tNote: A small amount of media is added to the collecting tube to prevent bubble formation that can block flow.\nDepending on flow rate, the syringe may need to be refilled after 24 to 36 hr. This is done by removing the connector from the housing inlet, replacing the syringe, and allowing media to perfuse at a high flow rate for several min. This sequence ensures that bubbles are not introduced to the tubing. Reset the pump to the desired flow rate for culture, insert the connector into the housing inlet, and return to the incubator.\n4. Device Analysis\nPermeability Analysis\nUse 40 kDa FITC-Dextran to visualize the permeability of the vessel in situ. Place the vessel housing on a confocal microscope and focus at the vessel plane. Add 5 µM 40 kDa FITC-Dextran to the inlet and image at 4X magnification, 25 msec exposure time, and at 1 frame per sec for 10 min.\nAnalyze the image series with analysis code to estimate the permeability of Dextran across the vessel wall into collagen (µm/sec) based on a model published by Zheng et. al. 31.\nImmunostaining & Confocal Imaging Analysis",
    "To fix vessels, perfuse with 3.7% formaldehyde through the inlet for 20 min and wash by perfusing PBS three times (20 min per wash). Block nonspecific antibody binding with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.5% Triton X-100 perfused through the network for 1 hr. Perfuse primary antibody solutions overnight at 4 °C and wash three times with PBS. Perfuse secondary antibody solutions for 1 - 2 hr, and wash again with PBS in the same manner.\nTake immunofluorescence images of microvessels in situ using a confocal microscope with a z-step of 1 µm. Image the microvessels at a magnification of 4X, 10X, or 20X.\n\t\tNote: Magnification of 4X will provide global network structure information, while 10X and 20X magnified images will provide cellular details such as elongation, junction formation, etc.\nAnalyze the image stacks using ImageJ with Z projections (Image/Stacks/Z-project), cross sections (Image/Stacks/Orthogonal view), and 3D reconstructions (Image/Stacks/3D Project).\nScanning Electron Microscopy Imaging\nFor electron microscopy analysis, fix in situ by perfusing half-strength Karnovsky's solution (2% paraformaldehyde/2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 M cacodylate buffer) overnight. Disassemble the vessel and carefully separate the two pieces. Trim edges and fully immerse in the fixative solution for several days.\nImmerse the thick top portion of the vessel in 25% glutaraldehyde for 20 min and rinse three times with PBS (2 min each). Dehydrate in serial ethanol washes of 50%, 70%, 85% (2 min each) and two washes in 100% ethanol (5 min each).\nPrepare the sample for analysis with further dehydration by critical point drying following the manufacturer's protocol 40. Sputter coat the vessel with gold-palladium (7 nm) and analyze under a scanning electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of 5 kV, spot size 3.\nSubscription Required.
