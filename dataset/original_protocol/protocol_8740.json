    "Animal care was in accordance with guidelines approved by Swiss local authorities (Amt für Landwirtschaft und Natur des Kantons Bern, Veterinärdienst, Sekretariat Tierversuche, approval Nrs. 52/11 and 35/14). These guidelines are in agreement with the European Community Directive 2010/63/EU.\nNote: Work in a laminar flow hood with sterile instruments and solutions for all steps 1 - 5 including sub-steps.\n1. Preparation of MEAs\nNote: MEAs are composed of a glass substrate, micro-fabricated metal electrodes and a SU-8 polymer insulation layer (also see Tscherter et al. 3). For the purpose of this study, commercially available MEAs were ordered with a customized electrode array layout (Figure 1 A&B). The 68 electrodes are arranged in a rectangular grid that is split into two zones by a 300 µm wide groove free of electrodes, electrical leads and insulation. Each electrode is 40 x 40 µm in size and they are spaced apart by 200 µm from center to center. Four large ground electrodes are positioned around the recording site. They differ from other commercially available standard MEAs in their size (21 mm x 21 mm) and they have no fixed recording chamber.\nFor disinfection rinse MEAs in 100% ethanol (2x), 70% ethanol (1x) and distilled water (2x) for at least 30 sec each. Let dry. Put 10 - 12 MEAs in a clean glass petri dish (150 mm x 25 mm) and close the lid.\nAutoclave MEAs for 20 min at 120 °C. Store at RT.\nPrepare the coating solution (see materials list) for the MEAs and store aliquots at -20 °C.\nPut each MEA in an individual sterile petri dish (35 mm x 10 mm).",
    "Use a cooled pipette to put 150 µl chilled coating solution on top of the electrodes and close the lid of the petri dish. After about 10 min, check for air bubbles on top of the electrodes and gently remove them with a rubber-covered spatula if necessary. Let rest for 1 hr at RT.\nAspirate coating solution residues, wash 1x with medium optimized for prenatal and embryonic neurons and 2x with distilled, sterile water. If MEAs are not used until the next day, keep them in distilled, sterile water at 37 °C in the incubator O/N. Otherwise, let directly dry at RT.\n2. Ingredients Required for the Preparation and Growth of Organotypic Cultures\nPrepare calcium-free wash solution (see materials list).\nReconstitute chicken plasma in wash solution (1:1, shake gently, avoid formation of bubbles), centrifuge at 3,000 x g for about 20 min and decant the clear content into a sterile tube. Aliquot 200 µl into cryotubes and store at -20 °C.\nReconstitute thrombin from bovine plasma accordingly (200 U/ml) and sterile-filter (0.2 µm pore filter). Aliquot 200 µl into crytotubes and store at -20 °C.\nFor 30 cultures prepare 100 ml of nutrient medium (see materials list).\n3. Spinal Cord Tissue Dissection\nNote: Procedure yields, depending on the number of embryos, spinal cord slices for about 25 - 35 co-cultures and is prepared inside a laminar flow hood under sterile conditions.\nApply a lethal dose of pentobarbital (0.4 ml) to the mother animal by intramuscular injection. Confirm deep anesthesia by checking the pedal withdrawal reflex. Deliver E14 rat embryos by cesarean section and sacrifice by decapitation.\nTransfer the bodies of the embryos into a petri dish filled with sterile, chilled, wash solution.",
    "Perform one complete transversal cut with a scalpel above the hindlimbs and another one above the forelimbs and remove the limbs from the body. Next, make a cut in the frontal plane to separate viscera from the back piece containing the spinal cord.\nFor slicing, transfer the back pieces containing the spinal cord one at a time on a mounting disk and cut at a thickness of 225 - 250 µm with a tissue chopper. Put a drop of wash solution on the chopped tissue and transfer slices with a spatula in 35 mm x 10 mm petri dishes filled with sterile, chilled, wash solution.\nFor each slice separately, dissect spinal cord away from remaining tissue. Leave dorsal root ganglia attached.\nLet the slices rest for 1 hr at 4 °C.\n4. Mounting Spinal Cord Tissue Slices on MEAs\nWarm up sterile nutrient medium in the incubator (37 °C, lightly unscrewed lid for oxygenation).\nPosition MEA with sterile tweezers with rubber-covered tips at RT in the petri dish under a stereo microscope with the electrode array in focus. Center a 6 µl droplet of chicken plasma on the clean, dust-free, and sterile electrode array. Using a small spatula, carefully slide two spinal cord sections with ventral sides facing each other into the plasma droplet. Do not touch the electrodes with the spatula.\nAdd 8 µl of thrombin around the chicken plasma droplet. Using the thrombin pipette tip, carefully mix and spread the chicken plasma/thrombin mixture around the two slices. Again, do not touch the brittle electrode array directly. Just before coagulation, aspirate excess chicken plasma/thrombin.\nCap the petri dish to retain high humidity while the MEA/culture assembly sits for about 1 hr in a humidified chamber inside the incubator at 37 °C.",
    "Carefully add 10 µl of nutrient medium to the culture chamber, cap the petri dish and put back into the incubator for about 30 min.\nPlace each MEA/culture assembly with sterile, rubber-covered tips into a roller tube, add 3 ml of nutrient medium and tightly close the lid. Place the roller tube in the roller drum rotating at 1 - 2 rpm in the incubator in a 5% CO2-containing atmosphere at 37 °C.\nChange half of the nutrient medium after 7 days in vitro (DIV) and afterwards 1 - 2 times per week.\n5. Mechanical Lesions\nTake the MEA/culture assembly with sterile, rubber-covered tips out of the roller tube and place in a petri dish without nutrient medium under a stereo microscope with the tissue in focus. Visually verify that the two slices are fused.\nHold the MEA/culture assembly steady by placing tweezers with rubber-covered tips on the MEA.\nPlace a scalpel blade in the groove of the MEA close to the tissue slices. Hold the scalpel rather horizontally.\nLift the scalpel handle up but let the scalpel blade stay in the groove of the MEA in such a way that the blade “rolls” from base to tip and thereby cuts through the tissue covering the groove.\nSevere any residual tissue connections with a 25 G needle tip if necessary. Work only in the area within the groove and do not touch the tender edges.\nPut the MEA/culture assembly back into the roller tube. Provide 3 ml of fresh nutrient medium to the cultures and place them back into the roller drum in the incubator.\n6. Electrophysiological Recordings of Spontaneous Activity",
    "To investigate functional regeneration among the two spinal cord slices after the chosen number of DIV, mount the MEA/culture assembly in a recording chamber on a microscope and apply about 500 µl extracellular solution (see materials list).\nWait 10 min before the first recording to allow the system to stabilize.\nRecord basic spontaneous activity 2x for about 10 min from each activity-detecting electrode of the MEA at RT.\nTo ensure stable extracellular conditions, exchange extracellular solution after every recording session.\nTo disinhibit the network, apply extracellular solution containing strychnine (1 μM) and gabazine (10 μM).  Wait for at least 2 min before starting the recording.\n7. Data Analysis\nNote: For the detection of the extracellularly recorded action potentials use for each electrode a detector based on standard deviations and a subsequent discriminator. This procedure is described in detail in Tscherter et al. 3.\nDisplay the detected neuronal activity of each electrode in a raster plot according to standard procedures 3 (Figure 1F).\nDetermine and display the total network activity for each slice by summing up the number of events in the according channels within a sliding window of 10 msec, shifted by 1 msec steps (Figure 1G and see Tscherter et al. 3).\nDetect in each slice individual bursts (clusters of activity that appear on several electrodes). Therefore, set a minimal peak activity threshold in the corresponding total network activity and define each burst start and burst end. For example, an appropriate threshold is 25% of the average burst amplitude and a burst start can be defined by being the first event in a time window of at least 5 msec, a burst end by being the last event in a time window of at least 25 msec (see Heidemann et al. 10).",
    "To quantify functional regeneration calculate the percentage of synchronized bursts between the two slices. To do this, calculate the latency between a burst in one slice and the following burst in the other slice.\n\tNote: A burst pair is termed “synchronized” when the latency is smaller than the average burst length. Especially in co-cultures with a lot of activity, the possibility exists that both sides coincidentally initiate a burst in the chosen latency window. This fact has to be taken into account in the quantification of the percentage of synchronized bursts. For a detailed description of the calculations see Heidemann et al.10.\n8. Fixation of the Cultures and Immunohistochemistry\nFor all steps that include washing or incubation make sure to put the cultures on a tilting table to ensure proper diffusion of the solution through the tissue.\nDirectly after the recording session is finished take the MEA/culture assembly out of the setup, put it in a petri dish (35 mm x 10 mm) and add about 2 ml of extracellular solution.\nTo separate the slices from the surrounding cell layers that have formed during the time in vitro, take a 10 µl pipette tip and circle the slices. Pay attention not to damage the cultures. It is possible to omit this step but embedding later on is easier when it is performed.\nUse a thin nonmetallic syringe needle (see materials list) in combination with a 1 ml syringe filled with extracellular solution to gently blow the culture off the MEA.",
    "Remove the tip of a Pasteur pipette and fit the rubber bulb on the slivered end. Use the back end to transfer the culture into fixative (4% paraformaldehyde with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M)). Do not use the standard tip of the Pasteur pipette for the transfer because it is too small and the cultures would be folded and probably damaged. Fix for 1 - 2 hr at 4 °C. Rinse the MEA with distilled water and remove tissue residues with fingertips but do not scratch with the nail. Store MEAs in distilled water at 4° C.\nWash the cultures 3x in PBS for at least 10 min each. Store in PBS at 4 °C or directly start with the staining procedure.\nIncubate the cultures for at least 90 min in blocking solution (5% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.3% detergent in PBS).\nAdd the first antibody diluted in blocking solution and incubate for 3 nights at 4 °C.\nWash 3x in PBS for at least 30 min each.\nAdd the second antibody diluted in PBS for 2 hr at RT.\nWash 3x in PBS for at least 30 min each.\nTransfer the slices with a Pasteur pipette with removed tip on an object slide. Remove excess PBS and embed with mounting medium."
