    "Protoplast preparationStreak the U. maydis strain from a 25% glycerol stock (maintained at -70°C) on solid YPD agar (Yeast extract, Peptone, Dextrose; see Recipe 7), incubate for 1-2 days at 28°C, and then store the plate at 4°C.Select a colony with a sterile toothpick.Culture cells at 28°C and 180 rpm in 100 mL of YPD medium for 18-24 h.Inoculate cells in 1 L of YPD liquid medium (at an initial optical density at 600 nm = 0.04 = 9 × 105 cells/mL) and incubate for 24 h at 28°C/180 rpm. The incubation time and culture media should be adjusted to your specific needs.Collect the cells using a pre-weighed 500 mL centrifuge bottle. Centrifuge for 5 min at 3,800 × g and 4°C in the FiberliteTM F12-6 × 500 LEX. Remove supernatant, suspend the cells in distilled water, and repeat the centrifugation step. Decant the supernatant.Measure the wet weight of the pellet, and add 12.5 mL of solution A per gram of wet weight. Use a glass or Teflon rod to suspend the cells. At this stage, cells can be vortexed to disperse cell aggregates. Transfer the cell suspension to a glass beaker. Add 0.016 g of the T. harzianum lysing enzymes per gram of wet weight. Gently mix with a Teflon or glass rod, and incubate for 30-60 min at 30°C in a water bath.To check the formation of protoplasts, shake the cell suspension every 10 min, withdraw 20 µL of the suspension, and mix with 980 µL of distilled water. Measure the optical density at 600 nm (Figure 1A). Due to the osmotic shock, cells without a cell wall burst, and their content are released to the medium. This results in a decrease in the optical density of the suspension.",
    "When the optical density reaches its minimal value, the formation of protoplasts is complete.Note: From this step, all procedures should be carried out at 4°C. Centrifuge the suspension at 3,800 × g at 4°C for 5 min to recover the protoplasts. Decant the supernatant.Add 12.5 mL of cold solution B per gram of initial wet weight, to wash the lysing enzymes. With a Teflon or glass rod, carefully suspend the protoplasts. Do not use the vortex to disperse the protoplasts. Then, centrifuge the suspension for 10 min at 3,800 × g and 4°C. The new pellet should be compact.Mitochondria isolationTransfer the pellet of protoplasts to a Teflon pestle homogenizer and add cold solution C (40 mL/25-30 g of the initial wet weight of cells) containing the complete cocktail of protease inhibitors plus PMSF (1 mM final concentration).Attach the Teflon pestle to the electric drill. Connect the drill to the variable autotransformer (rheostat), select an output intensity of 40, and homogenize for 20 cycles. Avoid the formation of foam and bubbles.After homogenization, bring the volume to 130 mL with cold solution C (containing protease inhibitors), transfer the suspension to 50 mL polycarbonate tubes, and eliminate cell debris and nuclei by centrifuging at 3,800 × g and 4°C for 10 min.Recover the supernatant from the polycarbonate tubes and centrifuge at 17,000 × g and 4°C for 10 min. Carefully decant the supernatant. Then, with the buffer remaining in the tube and with the help of a soft paintbrush (number 8 or 12, according to the biomass), suspend the mitochondrial pellet. Keep mitochondria at 4°C for same-day experiments, or at -70°C to be used later.Determine the protein concentration of your sample by the Lowry method (Lowry et al., 1951).",
    "Prepare a stock solution of 1 mg/mL BSA and construct a standard curve in the range of 5 to 100 µg protein. Dilute the sample tenfold using 0.4% sodium deoxycholate solution, and use 5-10 µL of the diluted sample for protein determination.Oxygen consumptionTo measure the respiratory activity of isolated mitochondria in a thermostated chamber with magnetic stirring, use a Clark-type oxygen electrode coupled to a YSI5300A biologic oxygen monitor.Bring the thermostated chamber, the solutions D and E, and the distilled water to 30°C.Pour 1.135 mL of distilled water, 65 µL of solution D (final concentration 50 mM), and 100 µL of solution E (final concentration 20 mM) in the chamber with magnetic stirring. Adjust the signal to 100%, which corresponds to the dissolved oxygen.Add 5-10 µL of isolated mitochondria; wait until the signal is stabilized and then stimulate oxygen consumption by adding 10 mM succinate (13 µL from 1 M stock solution), or 0.15 mM NADH (9.8 µL from 20 mM stock solution).To inhibit respiratory complex IV, add 0.5 mM KCN (2.6 µL from 0.25 M stock solution), or 2 µM n-octyl gallate (1.3 µL from 2 mM stock solution), to inhibit the alternative oxidaseWash the chamber with distilled water before adding new media.Calculate the specific activity by dividing the oxygen consumption slope by the amount of protein (mg) or the dry weight (g).Mitochondrial membrane potential assayTurn on the Olis Modernized AmincoTM DW-2 spectrophotometer and allow the lamp to warm up for 30 min. Select the dual-beam option, and adjust the wavelengths of monochromator 1 (MONO1) to 511 nm, and of MONO2 to 533 nm. In the dual-beam mode, the sample is illuminated with two different wavelengths, one corresponding to the reference wavelength and the other to the measuring wavelength.",
    "The output corresponds to the electronic subtraction of the absorbance at 511 nm minus the absorbance at 533 nm.Transfer 2.7 mL of solution F into a 3.7 mL glass cuvette containing a magnetic stirrer. Start the magnetic stirring. Add 2 µM safranine (5.4 µL from 1 mM stock solution) and then the mitochondrial sample (0.5-1.0 mg protein). Place the cuvette in the spectrophotometer and close the cover.Adjust the baseline and add, through a small hole made in the chamber cover, the substrate of your interest (for example, 10 mM of succinate, or 0.15 mM NADH) with a Hamilton syringe.To collapse the membrane potential generated by succinate or any other respiratory substrate, add 2-10 μM FCCP."
