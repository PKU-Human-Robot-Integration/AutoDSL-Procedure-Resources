    "1. Preparation of Agarose Coated Slides\nNOTE: Before fabricating the polymer microarrays, aminoalkylsilane-coated glass slides are coated with agarose I-B to minimize non-specific background binding and allow evaluation of polymers that bind or repel bacteria6. Silane coating facilitates the binding of agarose to the slides.\nMake up a 2% (w/v) solution of agarose I-B in distilled water in a 250 ml bottle.\nAfter capping the bottle loosely, heat the suspension in a microwave oven in 30 sec periods until dissolved. Ensure that the cap is not tightly closed to avoid any potential pressure build up. Remove the bottle regularly and swirl gently.\nEnsure that the solid has dissolved and the solution is clear. Pour this agarose solution into a 100 ml beaker, and place in a 65 °C water bath to maintain a liquid solution.\nDip the silane-coated slides into the agarose solution, ensuring uniform coating, and wipe the back of the slide with a tissue paper.\nDry the slides, with the coated side up, in a dust-free environment (e.g., inside a cupboard or fume hood) for a minimum of 24 hr.\nConfirm a uniform coating by visual inspection. Coating can be easily assessed by breathing onto the slide — condensation will form on uncoated regions. Only slides coated entirely and evenly should be used for microarray printing.\n2. Preparation of Polymer Solutions for Printing\nPrepare solutions (1% w/v) of a selection of preformed polymers consisting of polyacrylates, polyacrylamides and polyurethanes in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) in glass vials. (prepare 1 ml of each polymer). Vortex until the polymer is fully dissolved. Synthesis of polymers is described elsewhere6.",
    "Using a micro-pipette, fill each well of a 384 microwell plate with 25 µl polymer solution, ensuring that there is no cross contamination and each well contains a unique polymer. Use NMP as a negative control in at least 2 wells. Record the identity of polymer solution in each well on a well plate template or spreadsheet file.\n3. Printing Polymer Microarrays Using a Contact Printer\nNOTE: Printing of microarrays was performed using a contact printer. Specific instructions regarding polymer microarray printing are given below. For general guidelines on using the printer and safety recommendations, follow the user manual from the manufacturer. Although we use a contact printer, a suitable manual stamping device could also be used.\nAs advised in the printer user manual, create a routine (see step 3.3) that allows the printing of 384 liquids (the polymer solutions or NMP) in quadruplicates, using a 32-pin microarraying head (arranged as 8 rows and 4 columns).\nPrint 1,536 spots arranged as 48 rows and 32 columns. Program the routine to print in 12 sections, i.e., 32 solutions at a time, so that the printer can be stopped after printing each section to allow for cleaning of pins.\nTo create a printing routine:\n\t\nOpen the software and from the available options choose 'Create a new routine'. Select the 'Description' tab to input details of the experiment. Select the 'Head' tab and choose '32-pin microarraying head'.\nSelect the 'Source' tab and choose plate holder (source plate holder (1x5)), plate type (plate 384 x 6,000), total plates (1) and source order (by columns).",
    "In the tab 'Slide design', choose '3x1'' slide' and choose arraying by 'Field number'. Then select 'Arraying pattern'. Input 'Spot view' as 'layout' and 'Pattern dimensions' as 'Row count' (6), 'Column count' (8), 'Row pitch' (750) and 'Column pitch' (560). Choose one section to print first.\nIn the 'Slide layout' tab input the number of slides used for printing. Select the 'Print' tab to input the printing parameters (number of stamps per inking: 1, number of stamps per spot: 5, stamping time: 200 msec, inking time: 100 msec).\n\t\tNOTE: A routine is now created for printing 384 liquids (the polymer solutions or NMP) in quadruplicates, using a 32-pin microarraying head (arranged as 8 rows and 4 columns). In total the routine should print 1,536 spots arranged as 48 rows and 32 columns with a row pitch of 750 µm and column pitch of 560 µm.\nPlace the agarose-coated slides on the platform and ensure a good vacuum seal to hold the slides in position.\nAdjust the print-head so that all the pins are at the same height. Check this by manually lowering the head on to a glass slide and confirming that the pins move up at the same time. If there are any discrepancies with the height, adjust by using the sleeve on the pin up or down.\nPlace the well plate on the plate holder in the correct orientation, i.e., well A1 is to the top right of the holder and ensure the well plate is fixed firmly.\nUsing the height adjustor, ensure that the height of the plate holder is such that when picking the polymer solutions, the pins do not touch the bottom of the wells.",
    "NOTE: This is important for uniform polymer spotting and also to avoid spilling of polymer solutions into adjoining wells, thereby causing cross-contamination.\nSelect the 'Start' tab and choose the 'Run type' as 'Normal'. Click 'Run', and confirm that slide, well plate, etc., are in position when prompted.\nPrint 1 section at a time (32 solutions at a time; 12 sections), allowing for cleaning of pins between sections. Clean the pins thoroughly with paper towel dipped in acetone, followed by dry tissue paper to ensure the pins are fully dry.\nOn completion of printing of the microarrays, place them in a slide holder and dry them overnight in a vacuum oven set at 45 °C to remove the NMP in the polymer spots. After sterilization with UV light for 30 min, the microarrays are ready for inoculation of bacteria.\nBefore inoculating slides with bacteria, take a measurement of background fluorescence (as described in section 5). Use this measurement in the calculation of bacterial binding.\n4. Inoculation of Polymer Microarrays with Bacteria\nNOTE: Ensure good aseptic technique. All handling of cultures should be performed in a sterile environment: either using a Bunsen burner or in a flow hood. Cultures should be grown with oxygen availability, growth medium, and temperature adjusted to the requirements of each species.\nPrepare overnight cultures by inoculating 5 ml Luria-Bertani broth (LB: 10 g L-1 bacto-tryptone, 5 g L-1 NaCl, and 10 g L-1 yeast extract) with a colony from a plate. Incubate overnight at 37 °C, shaking at 200 rpm.\nPrepare freezer stocks of overnight cultures by addition of glycerol (10% concentration overall) and store the stock at -80 °C.",
    "In order to determine the cell numbers from samples of the thawed bacterial stocks, perform serial dilutions of each stock and grow the bacteria overnight on solid media. Accurate determination of cell numbers in stocks ensures appropriate inoculation of each species6.\nPrepare inocula for microarray. Single species cultures are grown as above and applied directly to the microarrays. BacMix-1 is a bacterial mixture of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (S. saprophyticus), and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). BacMix-2 is a bacterial mixture consisting of Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans), S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis).\nTo produce either mixed culture, mix overnights in equal volumes (3 ml each) and dilute four times with fresh LB (to around 50 ml final volume).\nPlace UV-sterilized polymer microarrays in rectangular 4-well plates and incubate them with 6 ml of mixed bacterial cultures at 37 °C with gentle agitation (30 rpm) for 5 days.\nAfter incubation, gently rinse the microarrays twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS: 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.8 mM KH2PO4) and incubate with a solution of 1 µg ml-1 of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) stain in PBS for 30 min.\nWash the stained microarray slides in a fresh well plate by covering with PBS and swirling gently, changing the PBS once. Dry under a flow of air. Apply a glass cover slip to the microarray slide and seal in place with glue. Once dry, sterilize the outer surface with 70% (v/v) ethanol.\nSafely dispose of cultures according to their containment level.\n5. Microarray Imaging and Analysis",
    "Capture single images for each polymer spot in brightfield and DAPI (Ex/Em = 358 nm / 361 nm) channels. Perform this manually with a fluorescent microscope or using an automated fluorescence microscope (with an X-Y-Z stage controlled by an image acquisition software) fitted with a 20X objective.\n\tNOTE: Refer to the manual18 for operating the software and adjusting the microscope to obtain images using brightfield and DAPI channels. Ensure that the gain and exposure time for image capture for all the microarrays are the same.\nObtain the average fluorescence intensity of each spot in the DAPI channel by choosing the spot area and quantifying the fluorescence with an image processing software.\nFor the background fluorescence of each spot, obtain images of the polymer spots on a replicate microarray incubated only with media with no bacteria. Deduct the background fluorescence from the intensity of the spot to obtain fluorescence from bacteria.\nCalculate average normalized value from the four spots, representing each polymer, used for comparing bacteria binding of various polymers6.\nIdentify the polymers that exhibit the least bacterial binding (lowest fluorescence) as 'hit' polymers6.\n6. Coating of Cover Slips for 'Hit' Validation\nTo Coat Coverslips with Polymers:\n\t\nPrepare solutions of 'hit' polymers (~2% w/v) in tetrahydrofuran (THF), or other appropriate solvent.\nSpin coat circular glass coverslips of suitable size with the polymer solutions using a spin coater at 2,000 rpm for 10 sec.\n\t\tNOTE: In absence of a spin coater, coverslips or other materials may be dip coated, although spin coating produces a more uniform surface.\nDry the coated coverslips in a convection oven at 40 °C overnight and sterilize using UV light for 30 min prior to inoculating bacteria.\nTo Coat Coverslips with Agarose for Negative Controls:",
    "Clean coverslips either by plasma treatment for 10 min or immersing in 1 M NaOH for 4 hr.\nImmerse the coverslips in acetonitrile containing 1% (3-aminopropyl) triethoxysilane overnight. Clean the coverslips with acetone 3 times and put into an oven (100 °C) for 1 hr.\nDip coat the dried coverslips with 1% agarose aqueous solution maintained in a water bath at 60 °C. Place the agarose coated coverslips on flat surface in dust-free ambient conditions for 24 hr and sterilize using UV light for 30 min prior to inoculating bacteria.\n7. Attachment and Analysis of Cover Slip Using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)\nAfter sterilization with UV light for 30 min, place the cover slips (polymer/agarose coated or uncoated glass) in a standard 12-well plate or 24-well plate (depending on the size of the coverslips) and incubate with bacteria as described in section 4.\nAfter incubation with bacteria, wash the uncoated and coated coverslips twice with 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and then fix with 2.5% (w/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 hr.\nPost-fix samples with 1% (w/v) osmium tetroxide for 1 hr at room temperature and dehydrate with sequential ethanol washes at 50, 70, 90 and 100% (v/v) for 30 min each.\nDry samples in CO2 according to standard protocols19. Drying time will depend on the nature of the sample.\nCoat samples in a gold/palladium alloy (60/40%) using a sputter coater with current at 30 mA and vacuum at 0.75 Torr. Examine under an electron microscope as per standard protocols20.\n\tNOTE: Ensure adequate safety precautions to manage risks resulting from storage, handling and disposal of Osmium tetroxide, as it is highly toxic.",
    "Visually compare images of the uncoated coverslips and those coated with agarose or the 'hit' polymers to confirm bacterial binding/repelling abilities of the polymers.\n\tNOTE: Resistance of attachment should be easily visible as a reduction of cells present.\nChoose the most promising 'hit' non-binding polymers for the coating studies with medical devices (e.g., central venous catheters)6.\n8. Selection of a Solvent for Coating Catheters\nEvaluate various solvents for their compatibility with the indwelling part of the catheter, as well as their ability to dissolve the 'hit' polymer. Cut parts of cath-1 and into cylindrical pieces 5 mm in length, and measure with a digital Vernier calliper.\nEvaluate various solvents such as acetic acid, ammonia, acetone, acetonitrile, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dimethylformamide (DMF), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, toluene and xylene. Immerse catheter pieces in the solvents for 12 hours and evaluate visually for integrity of catheter and clarity of solvent.\n\tNOTE: Choose a solvent that does not cause the catheters to swell or disintegrate or result in a turbid solvent. The solvent must dissolve the 'hit' polymers.\n9. Analysis of Bacterial Attachment on Catheters by Confocal Microscopy\nPrepare 2.5% (w/v) polymer solutions in acetone, or other suitable solvent as determined in section 8. Place 5 mm catheter pieces into a small glass vials (5 ml) and immerse them in 1 ml of the polymer solution for 2 min. Remove the excess polymer solution and dry the catheter pieces overnight in a vacuum oven at 40 °C.\nPrepare inoculum by mixing thawed bacterial stocks to give approximately 106 cells of each species in 50 ml LB6.\nSterilize coated and uncoated catheter pieces with UV light for 30 min and incubate with 1 ml inoculated LB in a 24-well plate, at 37 °C for 3 days, with gentle agitation6.",
    "After incubation, wash the catheters with PBS (2x, 2 ml), fix the bacteria with 10% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min, and wash with PBS (1 ml). Stain the bacteria on catheter pieces with DAPI (1 µg ml−1) for 20 min and wash with PBS (1 ml).\nObtain confocal images of the catheter pieces using the following settings: 405nm blue diode laser, detector range 414 to 502 nm, pin hole - Airy1, image Size - 1,024 × 1,024 pixels, voxel width - 105.2 nm, Z-stacks spacing 0.5µ m, magnification - 40X 1.25.\nComplete the confocal imaging by Z-stacking 50 images across 100 µm length of the catheter.\nAnalyze the images using suitable analysis software: flatten the Z-stacked images in the Z plane, using the function to extend depth of field, to create a single image of a catheter piece.\n\tNOTE: This image should then be analyzed to obtain the area of the catheter covered by bacteria, after background-correction using the 'flatten background' function.\n10. Analysis of Bacterial Attachment on Catheters by SEM\nPrepare 10% polymer solution (w/v) in acetone.\nPress a pipette tip (for 200 µl micropipette) into the mid portion of the cut piece of the catheter to hold it and dip the piece in the polymer solution for approximately 30 sec. Dry the coated piece in ambient conditions for 30 min. Apply a second coating by immersing again into the polymer solution and dry overnight in ambient conditions.",
    "After UV treatment and incubation with bacteria wash the pieces (n = 3) with PBS (2x, 1 ml) and transfer them into 48-well plates containing 10% formaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. After fixing, wash the pieces with PBS (1 ml), dry overnight at room temperature, mount on stubs with conductive carbon disks, and gold coat using a sputter coater (see step 7.5).\nObtain images using a scanning electron microscope6."
