Proceed immediately to the next step.\nInfect Vero cells with metacyclic trypomastigotes using a MOI of 100.\nMix 5 × 105 Vero cells (see preparing Vero cells for infection experiments[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4]) with 5 × 107 metacyclic trypomastigotes recovered in the previous step.",
    "Divide the mix of cells and parasites in two 75 cm2 culture flasks, complete the volume to 10 mL with complete culture medium and incubate at 37°C in a humid 5% CO2 environment.\nAfter 24 h of infection, discard the medium and rinse 2 times with 10 mL of DPBS to remove all trypomastigotes that have not invaded the cells.\nAdd 10 mL of complete culture medium to each flask and incubate at 37°C in a humid 5% CO2 environment.\nAfter 72 h of infection, replace the medium with fresh 10 mL of complete culture medium and incubate at 37°C in a humid 5% CO2 environment.\nAfter 96 h of infection, recover cell-derived trypomastigotes by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 20 min at 12°C.\nSuspend parasites in 2 mL of complete culture medium and determine the trypomastigotes number as described above.\nCritical: The first release of cell-derived trypomastigotes after an infection of Vero cells with metacyclic trypomastigotes can take more than 96 h. If the number of released parasites is less than 5 × 106 cells, add fresh 10 mL of medium to culture flasks and continue to incubate, monitoring daily until enough trypomastigotes have been released into the culture medium. See also troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section (problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nPrepare infective cell-derived trypomastigotes using a MOI of 10.\nMix 5 × 105 Vero cells (see preparing Vero cells for infection experiments[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4]) with 5 × 106 cell-derived trypomastigotes in a total of 20 mL of complete culture medium.\nDivide into two 75 cm2 culture flask and incubate for 4 h at 37°C in a humid 5% CO2 environment.\nDiscard the medium and rinse 2 times with 10 mL of DPBS to remove all free trypomastigotes.\nAdd 10 mL of complete culture medium and incubate at 37°C in a humid 5% CO2 environment.",
    "After 72 h of infection, replace the medium with a fresh 10 mL of complete culture medium and incubate again at 37°C in a humid 5% CO2 environment.\nAfter 96 h of infection, recover the cell-derived trypomastigotes by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 20 min at 12°C.\nCritical: To achieve higher infection rates for the intended assays, perform at least three cycles of reinfection with cell-derived trypomastigotes before storage. See also troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section (problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nStore infective cell-derived trypomastigotes in liquid nitrogen.\nSuspend the cell-derived trypomastigotes in the appropriate volume of 10% DMSO in FBS (v/v), to reach a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/mL.\nTransfer 1 mL to each cryotube.\nPut the cryotubes in a CoolCell container and place it in a −80°C freezer for 24 h.\nAlternatives: If a CoolCell container or similar is not available, it is possible to freeze the cryotubes in a small Styrofoam box for 4 h at −20°C and then for 20 h at −80°C.\nStore the frozen cryotubes under liquid nitrogen.\nCritical: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until there are at least 30 frozen vials of 5 × 106 cell-derived trypomastigotes. This is particularly important to keep experiments running continuously without having to prepare cell-derived trypomastigotes for each round of testing. Alternatively, it is possible to expand the number of flasks at the same time to have more cell-derived trypomastigotes, minimizing batch to batch variations.\nCompound testing in cell infection assays – Phase I: Preliminary screening for exclusion of non-active and toxic compounds\nTiming: 10 days",
    "In this step, the compounds are tested using cell infection assays in a single curve with a sparse number of concentration points. Compound testing in cell infection assays is very laborious and time consuming. Therefore, this approach is particularly interesting for a first screen, when a large number of compounds must be tested, allowing for exclusion of compounds non-active against T. cruzi and of compounds toxic for the host cells in parallel with pre-selection of those with higher intracellular T. cruzi inhibition for deeper investigation of their activity profile (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2388-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Overview of the compound testing – Phase I strategy\nCritical: Vero cells will be used throughout all the procedure, so it will be necessary always to keep them in culture (see maintaining Vero cells culture[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3]).\nNote: In this work, the amount of Vero cells and trypomastigotes are calculated for testing 28 different compounds (a total of 4 plates) but adjustments can be made according to the number of compounds to be tested in parallel.\nAlternatives: In this work, all pipetting was done manually, but if available, it is possible to use automatic liquid dispensing robots.\nDay 1:\nThaw a frozen vial containing 5 × 106 cell-derived trypomastigotes for obtention of fresh infective trypomastigotes.\nThaw rapidly by gentle agitation in a 37°C water bath and remove just before the content is fully thawed.\nNote: To reduce the possibility of contamination, keep the O-ring and cap above the water.\nTransfer the trypomastigotes to a centrifuge tube containing 9 mL of complete culture medium and centrifuge at 3,000 × g for 20 min at 12°C.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nSuspend the trypomastigotes in 1 mL of complete culture medium.",
    "Mix 5 × 105 Vero cells (see Obtaining Vero cells for infection experiments[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4]) with the trypomastigotes (5 × 106 parasites) in a 75 cm2 culture flask, complete the volume to 10 mL with complete culture medium and incubate for 4 h at 37°C in a humid 5% CO2 environment.\nAfter 4 h of infection, discard the medium and rinse 2 times with 10 mL of DPBS to remove all the parasites that have not invaded the cells.\nAdd 10 mL of complete culture medium and incubate for 96 h at 37°C in a humid 5% CO2 environment.\nDay 3:\nIn parallel, maintain a Vero cell culture for the next steps.\nInoculate 3,5 × 105 Vero cells in 10 mL of complete culture medium in a 75 cm2 culture flask (see maintaining Vero cells[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.3] and preparing Vero cells for infection experiments[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4]).\nIncubate at 37°C in a humid 5% CO2 environment.\nDay 5:\nAt late afternoon, discard the medium of the infected cells (from step 8) and rinse 2 times with 10 mL of DPBS to remove all trypomastigotes that have already been released, aiming to minimize new cycles of infection.\nAdd 10 mL of complete culture medium and incubate at 37°C in a humid 5% CO2 environment.\nDay 6:\nIn the morning, collect the released trypomastigotes by transferring the supernatant to a centrifuge tube.\nRecover the cell-derived trypomastigotes from the supernatant by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 20 min at 12°C.\nSuspend the parasites in 2 mL of complete culture medium and store at 4°C until the time of use.\nadd 10 mL of complete culture medium to the cell layer in the culture flask and incubate at 37°C in a humid 5% CO2 environment for another cycle of trypomastigote release.",
    "Still in the morning, using the cells seeded at step 9 (see preparing Vero cells for infection experiments[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4]), dilute the appropriate quantity of Vero cells in complete culture medium to have 2 × 104 cells/mL (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2388-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

In this work, we use a factor of 1.2 (20% of extra volume).\nUsing a multichannel pipette, transfer 100 μL of Vero cells (2 × 104 cells/mL) to each well of four 96-wells culture plates as indicated in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. Incubate at 37°C in a humid 5% CO2 environment.\nDo not use the wells of the border rows of the plate as they could not be properly analyzed by the automated imaging system but do not leave them empty. Add 100 μL of PBS at cell-free wells.\nNote: If other types of culture plates and automated imaging system provide good images from the edge wells, allowing for proper analysis, it is possible to use the edge wells. However, additional attention should be taken with evaporation issues.\nNote: In the steps using a multichannel pipette, use a sterile multichannel pipette tray or a sterile 9 cm diameter culture plate to keep the cell suspension.",

See also before you begin[href=https://www.wicell.org#before-you-begin] Section - obtaining mice for infection and compound testing[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.6].\nNote: In this work, all the animal experiments were carried out at the Animal Facility of FIOCRUZ ICC Paraná (Laboratory of Animal Models – LACEA) which is responsible to provide housing and husbandry. Specific Pathogens Free (SPF) animals, obtained from certified matrices imported from the Charles River laboratory – USA, are kept under aseptic conditions. All animals – individually identified and grouped according to their respective treatment, with a maximum of 5 animals per cage – are kept inside sterile ventilated racks and are always handled within laminar flows ensuring their sanitary integrity.\nThaw a frozen vial containing 5 × 106 cell-derived trypomastigotes for amplification and obtention of fresh infective trypomastigotes.\nThaw rapidly by gentle agitation in a 37°C water bath and remove just before the content is fully thawed.\nNote: To reduce the possibility of contamination, keep the O-ring and cap above the water.\nTransfer the trypomastigotes to a centrifuge tube containing 9 mL of complete culture medium.\nCentrifuge at 3,000 × g for 20 min at 12°C.\nDiscard the supernatant.\nSuspend the parasites in 1 mL of complete culture medium.\nInfect 5 × 105 Vero cells (see Obtaining Vero cells for infection experiments[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec1.4]) with thawed trypomastigotes (5 × 106 parasites) as described in step 3.\nInfection day:\nRecover cell-derived trypomastigote from the previous step and suspend parasites in DPBS to obtain 106 cells/mL.\nPrepare an appropriate volume for all inoculations: final volume = (100 μL per mouse) × [(number of mice per condition) × (number of conditions: untreated, reference drug benznidazole and test compound) + 2∗].",
    "Note: ∗ 2 extra doses for syringe dead volume.\nNote: T. cruzi strains present distinct virulence and require different amounts of parasites to cause an adequate acute infection and subsequent detection. The indicated parasite load of 105 parasites/mouse was standardized for T. cruzi Dm28c strain.\nInoculate 100 μL of infective parasites intraperitoneally in each mouse (Figure 20[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig20]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2388-Fig20.jpg\nFigure 20.

    "Ensure that the positioning of animals is reproduced in each acquisition, with the animals being placed in the same order.\nCritical: The time interval between D-luciferin inoculation and image acquisition is critical for proper comparison between groups. Ensure that the delayed time for anesthetizing and positioning animals on the IVIS is reproducible to minimize processing differences between groups. This time interval should be previously tested to determine the peak signal intensity and the time window. We found no significant difference in the 10–15 min interval.\nNote: If no signal was detected at this stage, please refer to problem 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.15]: in troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] session.\nNote: Images are processed using the Living Image software.
