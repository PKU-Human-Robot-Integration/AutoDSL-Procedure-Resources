    "**A. Preparation of Agar Plates**\n1. Prepare each culture medium in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.\n  2. After autoclaving and cooling to 47±2°C, supplement Columbia Agar with 5% v/v defibrinated horse blood.\n  3. Pour culture medium into sterile 9cm Petri dishes.\n  4. Leave plates to set and dry.\n  \n**B. Preparation of Culture Plates**\n1. Sub-culture each bacterial or fungal culture from frozen stocks onto the following agar medium: P. aeruginosa, _E.coli_, _S. aureus_, _K. rhizophila_, _E. faecalis_ and _B.subtilis_ on PCA; _M. haemolytica_ and _S. pneumoniae_ on CBA;_ A. brasiliensis_ and _C. albicans_ on SDA. \n  2. Incubate plate cultures at 37°C for approximately 24 h \\(bacterial strains), at 30°C for approximately 48 h \\(_C. albicans_) or at 30°C for 7 days \\(_A. brasiliensis_).\n  3. For each strain, with the exception of A. brasiliensis, collect from 3 to 5 colonies on the incubated plate.\n  4. Suspend cells in sterile MRD.\n  5. Vortex mix cell suspension to produce turbidity equivalent to that of a 0.5 McFarland standard. A suspension adjusted in this way contains approximately 1.0×108 CFU/ ml. \n  6. For  _A. brasiliensis_, flood the plate surface with MRD so that fungal hyphae are emulsified in the diluent.\n  7. Pipette from the plate into a sterile vial.\n  8. Prepare serial decimal dilutions in MRD, to a final level of 10-7 of each bacterial and fungal suspension. Apply dilutions of each bacterial or fungal strain to the surface of the appropriate agar plates using spiral plating and conventional surface spread plating.\n  9. For spiral plates use a 50 μl volume of each dilution 10-2, 10-3 and 10-4 on each of the appropriate agar plates.",
    "10. For spread plates applying a 0.5 ml volume of each dilution 10-5, 10-6 and 10-7 to the appropriate agar plate and distribute the inoculum with a sterile plastic “hockey stick” spreader. \n  11. Incubate plate cultures at 37°C for approximately 24 h \\(bacterial strains), at 30°C for approximately 48 h \\(_C. albicans_) or at 30°C for 4 days \\(_A. brasiliensis_) to ensure the formation of discrete colonies.\n  \n**Automated Colony Counting** \n1. For each organism, select a single incubated plate from each spiral plate and spread plate series choosing plates where single discrete colonies are obtained.\n  2. Place each selected plate on the ProtoCOL 3 stage and configure the instrument in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. \n  3. For reading CBA plates of _M. haemolytica_ and _S. pneumoniae_, insert the black plate to remove lower illumination. \n  4. Adjust software settings to count touching colonies as well as light colonies on a dark background or dark colonies on a light background, as appropriate.\n  5. Read spiral plates using the spiral frame setting with two sectors.\n  6. Read spread plates using the circular counting frame.\n  \n**Manual colony counting**\n1. Count colonies on both spiral and spread plates, using the on screen image of the plates produced by ProtoCOL 3.\n  \n**Comparison of plate counts**\n1. Analyse the manual and automated counts for each plate type \\(spiral and spread Tables 1 and 2) using a two-tailed t-test for paired samples \\(Microsoft Excel 2010 software).\n  2. For spiral plate data use the log CFU/ml figures to ensure normally distributed data. Results obtained using the t-test were p = 0.105 for spiral plate data.",
    "3. For spread plate data, use the count per frame to ensure that the raw colony counts within the circular frame are compared. Results obtained using the t-test p = 0.143 for spread plate data.\n  4. The t-test does not identify significant differences between manual and automated colony counting methods, for either plate type, at the 95% confidence level."
