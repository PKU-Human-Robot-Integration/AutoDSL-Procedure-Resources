  "procedures": [
    "All procedures used throughout this study were carried out according to the British Home Office regulations with regard to the Animal Scientific Procedures Act 1986.\n1. Determination of Calcium Binding Protein or Protein Content of Interneurons and Biocytin Visualization Following Electrophysiological Recordings and Biocytin Filling\nNote: At the end of the electrophysiological recordings, slices that contain biocytin-filled cells are fixed overnight prior to histological procedures. The fixative solution will be replaced with a single change of 0.1 M phosphate buffer the next morning, if the rest of the procedure is carried out on another day, in order to prevent tissue damage. The fixation solution (4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% saturated picric acid solution, 0.025% glutaraldehyde solution in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB)) must be made fresh on the day of the recordings for best results.\nAt the end of the electrophysiological recording, carefully pick up the slice containing the recorded cell(s) with a paintbrush and place it in a pot containing artificial cerebral spinal fluid (ACSF).\n\tNOTE: Details of the protocol used for slice preparation and intracellular recordings using sharp electrodes have been described previously28.\nIn a fume hood, carefully pick up the brain slice with a paintbrush and roll it onto a small piece of fine quality filter paper. Place another piece of moistened filter paper onto the slice and place the two pieces of wet filter paper in a small plastic pot containing 5-10 mL of fixative solution and store in the fridge overnight at 4 °C.\nPrepare a solution of gelatin in distilled water. Place 20 mL of distilled water in a beaker on a hot plate and heat it to 60 °C. Add progressively 2.4 g of gelatin to the water, wait until dissolved and allow it to cool to 35–40 °C before use to prevent tissue damage.",
    "Replace the fixative solution with 2 mL of 0.1 M PB. Place the slice in a Petri dish and cut away any excess tissue with a scalpel blade. Place the trimmed tissue in a Petri dish (diameter of 9 cm, height of 1.4 cm), ensuring that it lies flat with no folds or creases, and remove the excess buffer using a dry paintbrush.\nCover the tissue with the warm gelatin solution and place the Petri dish onto a frozen block to quickly cool the solution.\nUsing an angle-poise lamp to provide contrast, look through the side of the dish and keep the slice flat using light pressure from a fine paintbrush until the gelatin begins to set.\n\tNOTE: The gelatin can be re-melted if the tissue does not lie flat. Any imperfections on the surface of the gelatin caused by the removal of the paintbrush as it solidifies may be removed by melting the surface layer gently by moving the bulb of the lamp close to the surface for a few seconds.\nMove the dish of setting gelatin to the fridge and leave at 4 °C for 30-60 min.\nIn a fume hood, cut out a small block (~ 1 x 1 cm) containing the gelatin-embedded tissue of the dish using a scalpel blade, lift the block using a small spatula and carefully place it in the same but fresh fixative solution used to fix the slices for at least 30 min at 4 °C.\nWash the gelatin block in 5 mL of 0.1 M PB three times, dry it using a piece of paper tissue and stick the block side up (i.e., with the tissue at the top) onto a vibratome chuck using superglue.",
    "Remove excess glue with a piece of filter paper and use a scalpel blade to cut the corners of the block off, leaving a diamond shape.\nSection the slice at 50 µm thickness using a vibratome and place each section carefully in a glass vial containing 10% sucrose.\nCarefully pick up a section from the vial, place it flat into a Petri dish lid. Using a dissecting microscope and a fresh scalpel blade, remove the gelatin from around the section and return the section to a vial containing 2 mL of fresh 10% sucrose\n\tNOTE: It is crucial to remove as much gelatin as possible at this stage to reduce tissue shrinkage during the dehydration step (Step 1.37).\nCryo-protect the sections in 0.1 M PB-based sucrose-glycerol solution at room temperature by incubating them for 10 min in 10% sucrose solution, 20 min in 20% sucrose-6% glycerol solution twice and finally 30 min in 30% sucrose-12% glycerol solution twice under constant agitation.\nPlace the sections flat onto a small rectangle of tin foil using a paintbrush. Remove any excess liquid from the sections and carefully fold the tin foil into a parcel.\nHold the parcel close to the surface of liquid nitrogen without touching the surface for 30 s and then allow the sections to thaw completely for approximately 30 s. Repeat the freeze-thaw another two times.\nRemove all sections with a paintbrush and place them in a glass vial containing 2 mL of 0.1 M PB under constant agitation to wash off excess sucrose.\nRemove the PB with a Pasteur pipette and incubate the sections in 2 mL of 1% aqueous H2O2 for 30 min. Wash the sections in 2 mL of 0.1 M PB 3x 5 min.",
    "Remove the 0.1 M PB with a Pasteur pipette and add 1 % sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in 0.1 M PB.\n\tNOTE: Do not cap the vial, as NaBH4 solution gives off hydrogen gas.\nRemove the sodium borohydride with a Pasteur pipette and wash the sections thoroughly in 2 mL of 0.1 M PB 5x 5 min.\nReplace the 0.1 M PB with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) in 0.1 M PB for 30 min.\nRemove the goat serum and incubate the sections overnight at 4 °C in a mixture of mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies made up in ABC solution.\n\tNOTE: A list of primary antibodies used in previous studies is displayed in Table 1 in Botcher et al. (2014)29.\nIncubate the sections for 2 h in the dark in a mixture of fluorescently-labelled secondary antibodies (Table of Materials).\nMount the sections onto the slides in mounting medium and cover with a coverslip.\nTake images of fluorescence labelling at 40X magnification (Figure 1Bb).\nAfter the fluorescence imaging, place the slide into a glass Petri dish containing PBS and carefully remove the coverslip. Then wash the sections off the slide using gentle pulses of PBS from a Pasteur pipette. Place the sections into a clean glass vial containing PBS.\nPerform the avidin-HRP reaction by firstly incubating the sections in ABC for at least 2 h to amplify the HRP reaction product.\nPrepare the 3,5 diaminobenzidine (DAB) solution by adding one tablet to 5 mL of distilled water.\nWash the sections with PBS three times for 10 min and then with Tris buffer twice for 10 min. Remove the Tris buffer after the last wash.",
    "Quickly add one drop of 8 % NiCl2 solution to the DAB solution, pipette the solution in and out to mix and quickly add 1 mL of this solution over the sections. Incubate the sections in the DAB/NiCl2 solution for 15 min.\nAdd 10 µL of 1% H2O2 to the DAB solution. Allow the reaction to proceed in the dark under constant agitation for about 1 to 2 min and monitor the labelling of the filled cells with a dissecting microscope.\nStop the reaction by removing the DAB/NiCl2/H2O2 solution and wash the sections with Tris buffer twice for 5 min.\nIn a fume hood, place a small circle of filter paper into a Petri dish and dampen it with 0.1 M PB. Lift the sections one at a time from the glass vial using a paintbrush, and place them carefully flat upon the paper.\nCover the sections with another moistened circle of filter paper and remove excess buffer by gently touching tissue paper to the surface.\nApply 8–9 drops of 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1 M PB to the top paper, cover the dish and retain in the fume hood for at least 30 min, but no more than 1 h.\nOpen the Petri dish and lift the top filter paper. Lift the sections carefully one at a time with a paintbrush, place them in a glass vial and rinse them in distilled water twice.\nDispose of osmium tetroxide waste appropriately. Rinse all disposable equipment and place them in appropriate bins.",
    "Place each section flat onto a glass slide and coverslip the sections. Transfer the slide into a Petri dish, place an empty glass vial over the coverslip to retain it in place and cover with 50% alcohol. After 15 min, remove the slide from the solution and remove the sections from the slide. Place the sections back on the slide and then place the slide in 70% alcohol for 15 min. Repeat the same process with 95% and finally 100% alcohol solution.\nFollowing the dehydration step, transfer the sections to a glass vial containing 100% alcohol on a shaker in a fume hood. Replace the alcohol solution with propylene oxide (C3H6O) and wash three times for 5 min. Following the last wash, keep ~2 mL of propylene oxide in the vial and add resin (1:1 ratio). Ensure that the resin is dissolved and keep the sections under constant agitation for 30 min.\nPlace each section in an aluminum planchette containing epoxy resin using a wooden stick and incubate overnight.\n\tNOTE: Do not leave the sections in the resin longer than 24 h to avoid the risk of damaging the sections.\nPlace the planchette over a hot plate for approximately 10 min. Pick up each section with a wooden stick and place them on a clean slide. Keep the orientation of each section consistent using a dissecting microscope. Place a coverslip over the sections. Place the slide in the oven for 48 h at 56 °C for curing.\n2. 3D Neuronal Reconstructions\nNOTE: Neurolucida software is used. Instructions provided below only apply to a specific neurone reconstruction system (Table of Materials). The sections obtained from the cutting are matched prior to the reconstructions using a microscope.",
    "Place a slide on the stage and secure with stage clip and open the neuron reconstruction software. Click on Acquire tab and select Live image.\nMeasure the thickness of each section using 100X oil objective lens. Make a note of the value on the z-meter at the top and bottom of each section and calculate the section thickness as the difference of the two values.\nUse a low-magnification objective to focus on the Home section containing the cell body. Then use a 100x objective, focus on the cell body and click in the center to mark the reference point.\nFrom the Trace tab, select Serial Section Manager. Then select Create New Section (+ icon) in the Serial Section Manager window. Enter the number of sections. Name each section in the correct Z order and enter the cut thickness measured in Step 2.2.\nTo trace the soma in 3D using 100X objective, select Contour from the Trace tab and select the Cell Body contour. Use the joystick to move the focus to the very top of the cell body. Place the points by clicking around the perimeter of the part that is currently in focus. Right-click and select Close Contour to finish this first outline. Repeat this process at different z positions until the bottom of the cell body is reached (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Select 3D visualize in Trace tab to visualize the cell body in 3D.\nTo trace the cell body in 2D using 100X objective, select Cell Body from the Neuron menu in the Trace tab. Focus on the middle of the cell body. Place the points by clicking around the perimeter of the cell body. To complete the cell body, right-click and select Finish Cell Body.",
    "To trace the dendritic arbor, select Dendrite or Apical Dendrite in the Neuron menu. First trace a short, initial segment for each dendrite using the mouse scroll wheel to adjust the diameter of the cursor to match the diameter of the dendrite. Trace along each dendrites using the joystick to move across the section and the mouse scroll wheel to adjust the diameter of the tracing.\nCheck the alignment of the tracing with the live microscope image and adjust if necessary, especially after moving using the joystick. In the Trace tab, select Align Tracing, click on the tracing and then click on the correct location.\nWhen a node in the tree is reached, right-click and select Bifurcating Node or Trifurcating Node from the drop-down menu.\nWhen the end of a branch has been reached, select an ending from the drop-down menu in the Neuron menu. Select the correct ending type, i.e., High ending, normal ending or low ending to facilitate matching across sections.\nReduce the magnification on the microscope once all dendrites in the current section have been traced, select the Joy Free tab and move to a section that matches immediately above or below the completed section.\nTo identify matching points between the dendrites in a section that matches the completed section, click on the Move tab and select Match points. Select the number of points needed to be matched (three or more points is preferred) and then press OK. Click on the ending of a completed branch and then click on the branch. Repeat this for each match point. Repeat this process at 100X magnification to ensure accurate matching.",
    "Add matching branches to the previous section directly by right-clicking on the ending. Select Add to Ending when the branch lines up with the completed traced branch and trace as previously described.\nOnce all the dendrites of each section have been traced, trace the axon using the same process by selecting Axon from the Neuron menu.\nGo to the Home section, re-align the reconstruction with the live microscope image and select Contours from the Trace tab. Select a pre-defined contour/layer border/region border and click to trace along a contour. Select End Open Contour. Trace all desired layers and region outlines.\nUse 3D visualize in Trace tab to visualize the reconstructions in 3D.\nTo record videos of 3D reconstructions (Video 1), open the 3D reconstruction and open Create movies. Set a file destination and desired rotation speed. It is recommended to set the rotation to 270°. Select Start recording, record for a few seconds, then click Auto-rotate. Select Stop recording when required. Edit the video with a video editing software (Table of Materials).\nTo export the files into Tiff or JPEG files, select File | Export | Export tracing as image. Choose a µm/pixel ratio and select Fit. Select a background color and select File. Name the file, select Tiff or JPEG and press Save. To export the files into vector files, select File | Export | Export tracing as vector files.\nUse a neuron reconstruction analysis software to perform morphometric analyses.\n\t\nTo analyze dendritic trees and obtain a dendrogram, open the file in Neurolucida Explorer. Select Analyze | Structure and select Dendrogram from the drop-down menu (Figure 3).",
    "To perform a comprehensive morphometric analysis of the 3D reconstructions (branch complexity, volumes of branches and somas, surface area), open the file in the software. In the View tab, click Select all. Select the Analyze tab. Then select Structure and Branch Structure Analysis.\n3. Trouble-shooting\nChange camera settings. For best results, set the exposure time to less than 100 ms and gain and offset as close to 0 as possible.\nIf the neuron reconstruction software does not automatically display the traced contours as a 3D cell body in 3D visualize in Trace tab, select Select objects in Trace tab, hold down the Ctrl key on the keyboard and click on all the drawn contours, right click and then select Set cell body on the drop-down menu.\nTo adjust the z-parameters of an individual branch, select the tree (Select objects in Trace tab) and set the z-adjustment of all points via the right-click menu drop down. Select Modify z position, then select Shift z value and enter the required value.\nRealign the reconstructions using 'Go To' in the ' Move' tab when it is necessary to move a large distance over the tracing.\nAdd additional nodes at any point during the reconstruction process. Select the branch where the node is to be placed into (Select Object in Trace tab and click on the branch), right-click, and select Insert Node into Selected Tree. Then click on the right location on the branch.",
    "When reconstructing a complex neurone, trace matching branches individually and later splice them for easier identification of branches. Trace the branches in the new section individually and then attach these branches to the matching branches on the previous section by hovering over the ending of the branch to be spliced, right-click and select Splice, then hovering over the ending that the branch is to be spliced to and click.\nIf a branch is traced under the wrong tree type, select the tree, right-click and select Change Tree Type, and select the correct tree type.\nIf a point is incorrectly placed, perform Ctrl + Z, or click the Undo button in the Trace menu to remove the last point. However, this procedure will not work if the joystick is used to move across the section before attempting to remove a point. In this case, the point may be removed when the branch is ended. Select the branch (Press Select Object and click on the branch), hover over the point to be removed, right-click and select remove point.\nIf unsure whether two branches are matched, either 1) use 3D Visualize in Trace tab to check whether the branches match in the z-plane, or 2) use Show Flanking feature in the Serial Section Manager to display sections immediately above and below the current section in grey.\nIf a section is flipped, go to Tools in the Trace tab. Select Adjust XY Scaling and change X-axis to -1. Then select Correct Z-shrinkage and change z-axis to -1. Then trace branches as usual. Remember to reverse these changes when moving to a section which had the original orientation. Changing the x- and z-axis will not change branch ending labels, so take care when splicing that the correct endings are being used.",
    "Correct Z-shrinkage can be corrected, if there is a significant difference between the section cut thickness and the mounted thickness measured. In the Trace tab, select Tools, then Correct Z-shrinkage, and enter the shrinkage factor for the z-axis as a decimal representation of the cut thickness divided by the mounted thickness."
