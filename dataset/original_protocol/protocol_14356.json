    "1. Preparation of Mutant pcDNA3.1/GLA and pcDNA3.1/GAA Constructs\nNOTE: The cloning strategies for the GLA and GAA coding sequences (cds) have been reported earlier15,18.\nSite-directed Mutagenesis Using Site-Directed Mutagenesis\nUse the reference sequences NM_000169.2 and NM_000152.4 as templates for the mutagenesis of GLA and GAA genes, respectively. Have a set of high purity salt free primers (25-37-mers) synthesized by a commercial provider, with sense and antisense primers carrying one of the respective sequence modifications central to their length to individually introduce the mutation. Use the free primer design tool to support the primer design19.\nFor the reaction mixture, use the standard conditions for the reaction solution and PCR conditions provided by the manufacturer.\n\t\t\nMix 5 µL of 10x reaction buffer, 10 ng of double-stranded template plasmid DNA (pcDNA3.1/GLA or pcDNA3.1/GAA), 125 ng of each primer, 1 µL of the provided dNTP mixture, 3 µL of DMSO reagent in an appropriate volume of deionized water (final reaction volume: 50 µL). Finally, add 2.5 U of DNA polymerase and mix by pipetting up and down. As a negative control, carry along a no-primer sample.\nStart the PCR using the following program: step 1: 95 °C for 1 min, step 2: 95 °C for 50 s, step 3: 60 °C for 50 s, step 4: 68 °C for 8 min, repeat step 2-4 18 times, and step 5: 68 °C for 10 min.\n\t\t\nFollowing PCR, add 1 µL of the DpnI restriction enzyme (10 U/µL) and further incubate the reaction vial at 37 °C for 1 h.\nTransformation and Screening for the Desired Clone",
    "Transform an aliquot of ultracompetent cells in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. Use SOC medium (tryptone 2% (w/v), yeast extract 0.5% (w/v), NaCl 10 mM, KCl 2.5 mM, sterilize at 121 °C, and then add sterile-filtered solutions of MgCl2 and glucose up to final concentrations of 10 and 20 mM, respectively) instead of the manufacturer's medium. After the procedure, plate 250 µL of the sample mutagenesis on an LB plate containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin and incubate at 37 °C for 18 h.\nAssure that the number of transformants is >10 and the reaction yields at least three times as many colonies as the no-primer control reaction, e.g., using a luminous plate to facilitate colony counting. Then pick 3 colonies and prepare 3 mL overnight cultures in LB Broth medium.\nThe next day, carry out plasmid preparation with a standard kit and analyze whole sequence using T7 (5ʹ-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3ʹ) and BGHr (5ʹ-TAG AAG GCA CAG TCG AGG-3ʹ) primers via standard Sanger sequencing.\nUse a suitable molecular biology tool to analyze the sequence. When the desired mutation is detected and no further sequence abnormality compared to NM_000169.2 (α-galactosidase A) or NM_000152.4 (acid α-glucosidase) is seen, select the clone for transfection-grade plasmid purification.\nDetermine the purity of the DNA by measuring the absorbance in a spectrophotometer.\n\t\tNOTE: Allow only preparations that yield a plasmid purity with a 260/280 absorbance ratio of >1.8 for cell culture experiments.\n2. Cultivation of HEK293H Cells\nMaintain HEK293H cells in high glucose (4.5 g/L) Dulbecco´s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Keep the cells in a water-jacket incubator at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere.\nCultivate the cells to a density of 80 - 90%.",
    "Aspirate the medium and wash once using phosphate buffered saline (PBS) without Ca2+ and Mg2+.\nPassage by adding 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA and incubate for 5 min at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nSplit the cells 1:15 in fresh medium and seed into a new T75 flask to maintain the permanent culture. Do not use cells with more than 25 passages.\n3. pcDNA3.1/GLA and pcDNA3.1/GAA Plasmid Transfection and Treatment of HEK293H\n24 h prior to the transfection, wash the HEK293H cells in a T75 cell culture flask once with PBS with Ca2+, Mg2+. Harvest the cells with 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA as stated above and seed 1.5 x 105 cells in the cavities of a 24 well culture plate using 500 µL DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS without antibiotics.\nCarry out a transfection protocol according to the manufacturer's manual. Typically, use a mixture of 1 µg of plasmid DNA and 2.5 µL of transfection reagent in 100 µL of serum-free DMEM. Incubate for 20 min at room temperature and add to the cells in a drop-wise manner thereafter.\nRemove the medium containing the transfection reagent after a period of 4 h at 37 °C/5% CO2 and add 500 µL of fresh DMEM with 10% FBS/ 1% penicillin/streptomycin.\n\tNOTE: During this step, 1-Deoxygalactonojirimycin Hydrochloride (DGJ) or 1-Deoxynojirimycin Hydrochloride (DNJ) might be added to the culture medium where intended (use an aqueous stock solution of 10 mM in order to obtain a final concentration of 20 µM DGJ and DNJ). Fresh DGJ or DNJ was added 42 h after plasmid transfection.\n4. Cell Harvest and α-galactosidase A or Acid α-glucosidase Activity Measurement\nCell harvest\nOn the day of the harvest, remove the cells from the incubator and aspirate the medium. Carefully wash the cells 2 times with PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+.",
    "NOTE: This step is critical because DGJ and DNJ are potent inhibitors of α-galactosidase and α-glucosidase, respectively, and any leftover would invalidate the test.\nAdd 200 µL of deionized water directly on top of the cells. Rinse the cells from the plate and transfer them to a 1.5 mL reaction tube.\nHomogenization by freezing and thawing\nPut the samples in an appropriate foam rack and vortex for 5 s to make the lysis more efficient. Put the samples alternating in liquid nitrogen for 10 s and in a room temperature water bath until the thawing was complete (5 min).\nRepeat this procedure 5 times and then spin the samples for 5 min at 10,000 x g. Retain the supernatant and pipette in a new reaction tube.\nProtein concentration determination using bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay\nPrepare a fresh tube for each sample containing 40 µL of deionized H2O and add 10 µL of sample. Mix solution by vortexing briefly and transfer 10 µL into a cavity of a 96 well plate (each sample in triplicate). Dilute a 2 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (BSA) stock solution in deionized H2O as follows to obtain a standard curve: 50 µL H2O/50 µL BSA; 60 µL H2O/40 µL BSA; 70 µL H2O/30 µL BSA; 80 µL H2O/20 µL BSA; 90 µL H2O/10 µL BSA; 100 µL H2O.\nStart the reaction by adding 200 µL of BCA reagent (Reagent A and reagent B mixed at a 50:1 ratio) and incubate for 1 h in the dark at 37 °C under slight agitation on an orbital shaker (300 rpm). Measure the absorbance at 560 nm in a plate reader.\n\t\tNOTE: The samples typically contain between 1 and 1.5 µg protein per µL.\nEnzyme activity measurement with artificial 4-Methylumbelliferyl substrates (4-MUG)",
    "Dilute the calculated amount of each sample and pipet into fresh 1.5 mL reaction tubes to obtain 0.05 (for α-galactosidase A) or 0.5 (for acid α-glucosidase) µg protein/µL solutions. Vortex the samples for 5 s again and pipet 10 µL of this dilution into a 96 well plate (each sample in duplicate).\nStart the reaction by adding 20 µL of the respective substrate solution:\n\t\tFor α-galactosidase A: 2 mM 4-Methylumbelliferyl-α-D-galactopyranoside (4-MU-gal) in 0.06 M phosphate citrate buffer, pH 4.7.\n\t\tFor acid α-glucosidase: 2 mM 4-methylumbelliferyl α-D-glucopyranoside (4-MU-glu) in 0.025 M sodium acetate, pH 4.0.\nIncubate the enzyme reactions for 1 h in the dark at 37 °C under slight agitation on an orbital shaker (300 rpm). Terminate the reaction by the addition of 200 µL of 1.0 M, pH 10.5 adjusted glycine-NaOH buffer.\nPrepare a standard curve of 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) from a 0.01 mg/mL stock as follows:\n\t\t100 µL H2O/ no 4-MU; 80 µL H2O/ 20 µL 4-MU; 60 µL H2O/ 40 µL 4-MU; 40 µL H2O/ 60 µL 4-MU; 20 µL H2O/ 80 µL 4-MU; no H2O/ 100 µL 4-MU, pipet 10 µL of each dilution into the 96 well plate (in duplicates) and add 200 µL of the 1.0 M glycine-NaOH buffer to each well in order to adjust the volume and pH.\nMeasure the enzyme activity in a fluorescence reader equipped with the appropriate filter set and analyze the data using the appropriate software for the fluorescence reader device.\n\t\tNOTE: Both 4-MUG substrates are reduced to 4-MU during exposure to α-galactosidase A or acid α-glucosidase. Released 4-MU is a fluorochrome, which can be measured at 360 and 465 nm as the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively, using a microplate fluorescence reader.\nSubscription Required.
