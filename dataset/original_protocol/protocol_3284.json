    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTransfection\nTiming: 24 h\nWhen detecting exogenous ubiquitination of target proteins, cells need to be transfected with target protein plasmid and ubiquitin plasmid. The 10 cm dish was taken as an example here.\nPlasmid transfection\nObserve the density of 293T cells under a microscope. The optimal cell density for transfection is 80%.\nDiscard the culture medium and change to 5 mL DMEM (No FBS, No antibiotics).\nPrepare the DNA solution: Mix an appropriate amount of plasmids as indicated in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] with 250 μL DMEM (No FBS, No antibiotics).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3053_10.csv\nPrepare the Lipofectamine 2000 solution (see problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]): Add the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent in a ratio of 1 μL: 1 μg plasmid in 250 μL DMEM (No FBS, No antibiotics).\nMix the DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 solutions: Add the diluted DNA solution dropwise to the diluted Lipofectamine 2000 solution while pipetting to mix.\nIncubate the mixture: Let the DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 mixture incubate at 25°C for 15 min.\nAdd the mixture to the cells: Add the DNA- Lipofectamine 2000 mixture to the cells in a dropwise manner, while gently swirling the plate to ensure even distribution.\nChange to complete culture medium 4–6 h after transfection.\nIncubate the cells in a 37°C incubator for 24 h to allow for protein expression.\nNote: If you detect the endogenous ubiquitination, you can skip this step.\nImmunoprecipitation\nTiming: 24 h\nNext, you need to pull down your target protein by co-IP to detect its ubiquitination.\nCell lysis\nAdd MG132 to the 293T cells at a final concentration of 10 μM. Incubate the cells in a 37°C incubator for 3–6 h.\nDiscard the culture medium and wash the cells with 3 mL PBS.",
    "Discard PBS and add 700 μL cell lysis buffer (WB-IP) to lyse the cells. Then collect the cells by gently scraping with a cell scraper into a 1.5 mL EP tube and incubate on ice for 30 min.\nNote: You need to add PMSF (100 nM) and protease inhibitor cocktail (100×) to the lysis buffer at a ratio of 1:100.\nAfter that, the sample needs to be centrifuged at 4°C and 14,000 × g for 5 min. Then the supernatant is separated into the new EP tube.\nAbsorb 100 μL supernatant as INPUT to detect the expression of transfected plasmids. Add 25 μL 5 × loading buffer and boil for 10 min at 100°C.\nNote: The sample can be stored at ‒20°C for up to 1 year.\nCO-IP\nAdd 3–5 μL of antibody specific to your target protein (for endogenous ubiquitination) or the tag of your target protein (for exogenous ubiquitination) into the remanent supernatant, then incubate and shake the mixture gently at 4°C for 1 h.\nAdd 40 μL protein G beads that bind to the antibody, incubate and shake the mixture gently at 4°C for 12–16 h.\nCollect the beads by centrifugation at 4°C and 14,000 × g for 30 s, carefully absorb the supernatant with a pipette and discard it.\nWash the beads with 1 mL PBS (containing 25% lysis buffer WB-IP and 1% PMSF) and shake the mixture gently at 4°C for 10 min (see problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]).\nRepeat steps c. and d. three times.\nFinally, collect the beads by centrifugation at 4°C and 14,000 × g for 30 s and discard the supernatant with a pipette. Add 20 μL washing buffer and 5 μL 5× loading buffer and boil for 5 min at 100°C.",
    "Note: The sample can be stored at ‒20°C for up to 1 year.\nWestern blot\nTiming: 2 days\nPrepare SDS-PAGE gels.\nPrepare the resolving gel solution: Mix the appropriate amounts according to the formula.\nNote: The concentration of the gels can vary depending on the size of the protein of interest. Low-concentration gel is used for high molecular weight proteins. High-concentration gel is used for low molecular weight proteins.\nPour the resolving gel: Carefully pour the resolving gel solution into the gel cassette, leaving 2 cm for the stacking gel to be added on top. Add 1 mL ddH2O to the resolving gel solution.\nNote: Let it polymerize for approximately 30 min. When you see a clear dividing line between water and gel, it means the gel has polymerized.\nPrepare the stacking gel solution: Mix the appropriate amounts according to the formula.\nPour the stacking gel: Discard the ddH2O and carefully pour the stacking gel solution on top of the resolving gel.\nInsert the comb: Insert the comb into the stacking gel solution and let it polymerize for approximately 30 min.\nNote: Try to avoid bubbles.\nSDS-PAGE\nClamp gel into apparatus, and fill electrophoresis chambers with 1× SDS buffer.\nRemove the comb and carefully load IP samples (20 μL), INPUT samples (20 μL), and protein marker (5 μL) into the wells.\nRun the electrophoresis at 80 V until the proteins run out of the stacking gel, then change to 120 V and run until the dye front reaches the bottom of the gel.\nTransmembrane\nAssemble the transfer sandwich: Wet four pieces of filter paper with transmembrane buffer and place them onto the transfer apparatus one by one.\nNote: Try to avoid bubbles between the filter paper.",
    "Prepare the PVDF membrane: Cut a piece of PVDF membrane (6 cm × 9 cm) and soak it in methanol for 1 min. Then place the PVDF membrane on top of the filter paper, and wet it with transmembrane buffer.\nNote: Try to avoid bubbles between the filter paper and the membrane.\nPrepare the gel: Carefully remove the gel from the cassette and rinse it briefly with distilled water. Place the gel onto the PVDF membrane, making sure there are no air bubbles between the gel and the membrane.\nWet four pieces of filter paper with transmembrane buffer and place them onto the gel one by one. Then clamp the transfer apparatus.\nAdd the transfer buffer: Add enough transmembrane buffer to the transfer apparatus to cover the gel and the membrane.\nNote: To avoid excessive heat during transmembrane, the transmembrane equipment can be placed on ice.\nTransfer the proteins: Run the transfer apparatus at 300 mA for the appropriate amount of time, depending on the protein size and transfer efficiency (see problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nNote: To detect the ubiquitination of protein, the transmembrane time is 1.5 h.\nDetect proteins.\nBlock the membrane: Block the PVDF membrane with a blocking buffer (5% non-fat dry milk in TBST) for 2 h at 25°C to prevent the non-specific binding of the primary antibody.\nIncubate with primary antibody: Incubate the membrane with the primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer 12–16 h at 4°C with gentle agitation.\nAlternatives: Incubate the membrane with the primary antibody diluted in blocking buffer for 2 h at 25°C with gentle agitation.\nNote: Dilute the primary antibody according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nWash the membrane: Wash the membrane with TBST buffer three times for 10 min each to remove the unbound primary antibody.",
    "Incubate with secondary antibody: Incubate the membrane with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP), diluted in blocking buffer for 1 h at 25°C with gentle agitation.\nNote: Dilute the secondary antibody according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nWash the membrane: Wash the membrane with TBST buffer three times for 10 min each to remove the unbound secondary antibody.\nDetect the protein: Detect the protein using a chemiluminescence imaging system. Typical exogenous and endogenous K27-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS is shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] (see problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3053-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. The effect of UBL7 on the K27-linked polyubiquitination of MAVS\n(A) Ubiquitination detection of exogenous MAVS. 293T cells were transfected with pcDNA4.0-Myc-MAVS, pcDNA3.0-flag/pcDNA3.0-flag-UBL7 and HA-ub-K27 as indicated. After 24 h, the cells were treated with 10 μM MG132 for 3 h. Then cells were harvested and lysed by lysis buffer, cell lysates were IP with anti-Myc-MAVS antibody followed by IB analysis with anti-HA-ub-K27 antibody.\n(B) Ubiquitination detection of endogenous MAVS. We isolated primary MEFs (embryonic fibroblasts) from WT or UBL7 KO mice following standard protocol. MEFs were harvested and lysed by lysis buffer, cell lysates were IP with anti-MAVS antibody followed by IB analysis with anti-K27-ub antibody."
