    "1. Synthesis of DOX-PA\nWeigh 390 mg of doxorubicin and 243 mg of palmitic acid hydrazide, and transfer to a round bottom flask.\nAdd 150 ml of anhydrous methanol to the flask with a glass syringe. Add 39 µl of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) with a pipette. Using a magnetic stirrer, stir the reaction mixture for 18 hr at RT in the dark.\nNOTE: The quantities of reaction materials can be scaled up or down to obtain different amounts of DOX-PA. The ratio of reactants should be maintained in the same proportions. Reactions using DOX quantities in the range of 78 mg to 1,170 mg can be performed in a regular chemistry laboratory.\nPurification of DOX-PA using a silica gel column.17\nRemove the solvent in the reaction mixture with a rotary evaporator. Add 3 g of silica gel after the volume of the mixture is reduced to around 20 ml. Continue rotary evaporation to yield dry powders and to allow the adsorption of products onto the silica gel. Keep the sample under a vacuum for an additional 30 min after the dry powders are formed.\nPack 50 g of silica gel into a column using dichloromethane as a solvent. Carefully add the silica gel sample containing adsorbed product to the column.\nElute the column with a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol, while gradually increasing the percentage of methanol, thereby increasing solvent polarity (Table 1).\nCollect fractions of eluent in test tubes (25 ml/tube) and monitor the progress by thin layer chromatography (TLC).\nCombine all fractions containing pure DOX-PA and remove the solvent using a rotary evaporator until dry powder is formed. Further dry the product under a vacuum O/N.\nAnalysis of DOX-PA by TLC.",
    "Cut a 4 cm x 8 cm section of TLC plate. Spot sample solutions 0.5 cm from the bottom of the plate with TLC spotting capillaries using methanol as the solvent.\nPlace the TLC plate into a developing chamber containing a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol (3/1, v/v). The depth of solvent should be just less than 0.5 cm.\nRemove the plate from the developing chamber when the solvent front reaches the top of the plate. Mark the location of the solvent front with a pencil and allow the plate to dry. Place the TLC plate into a staining chamber containing saturated iodine vapor in order to visualize samples.\nAnalysis of DOX-PA with 1H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-NMR).18\nDissolve 15 mg of DOX-PA in 1 ml of methyl sulfoxide-d6 (DMSO) and transfer the sample into an NMR tube.\nInsert the NMR tube into the magnet of the NMR instrument. Measure the proton spectrum, selecting DMSO as a solvent. Remove the NMR tube from the magnet. Analyze the NMR result18.\n2. Preparation of DOX-PA Micelles by Film-dispersion Method\nDissolve DSPE-PEG (40 mg) and DOX-PA (4 mg) with 2 ml of methanol in a 10 ml glass vial.\nRemove the organic solvent under a vacuum using a rotary evaporator until a thin film forms in the vial.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, evaporate the organic solvents under inert gas (e.g., argon or nitrogen gas) to form a film and keep the vial in a vacuum desiccator to further remove residual solvent.\nTransfer 2 ml of Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4, DPBS) to the glass vial.\nPlace the vial in an ultrasonic bath for 3 min at RT to generate micelles.",
    "NOTE: Ultrasonic power varies among different models of ultrasonic baths. Select a unit which can generate enough ultrasonic power to disperse the thin polymer/drug film. The output power of ultrasonic bath used in this protocol is 110 W.\nKeep micelles at 4 °C for short-term storage and -20 °C for long-term storage.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, micelles can also be freeze-dried and reconstituted with water before use. Usually, no cryoprotectant or lyoprotectant is needed for this formulation.\n3. Characterization of DOX-PA Micelles\nDetermination of DOX-PA concentration in micelles and drug encapsulation efficiency\nDissolve DOX-PA synthesized in previous steps in DMSO to prepare DOX-PA solutions of five different concentrations: 1 µg/ml, 5 µg/ml, 20 µg/ml, 50 µg/ml, and 100 µg/ml. Measure the absorption of DOX-PA solutions with a UV-VIS spectrometer at 490 nm. Generate a standard curve based on the DOX-PA drug concentrations and their corresponding absorption at 490 nm.\nDilute 25 µl of drug-loaded micelle with 500 µl of DMSO. Measure the absorption at 490 nm with a UV-VIS spectrometer. Calculate drug concentrations with the standard curve generated in 3.1.1.\nCalculate encapsulation efficiency using the following equation:\n\t\tDrug Encapsulation Efficiency (%) = (amount of drugs in micelles)/(amount of added drug) × 100%\nCharacterization of particle size with dynamic light scattering (DLS)\nDilute micelles with DPBS (pH 7.4) to a final DSPE-PEG concentration of 1 mg/ml. Analyze a 2 ml sample with a particle size analyzer to obtain the Z-average size and polydispersity index (PDI).\nEvaluation of in vitro anticancer activity\n\tNOTE: Use appropriate sterile technique and operate inside a biosafety cabinet.\n\t\nRemove the cell culture medium from a cell culture flask (e.g., T25) containing DU-145 human prostate cancer cells and rinse the cells with 2 ml of DPBS (pH 7.4).",
    "Aspirate DPBS, add 1 ml of trypsin solution (0.25%), and incubate for 2 min at 37 °C to detach the cells.\nAdd 10 ml of cell culture medium (RPMI 1640 + 10% Fetal Bovine Serum + 1% Antibiotic-Antimycotic), when most of cells are detached from the flask. Transfer cells to a 15-ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge the cells at 1,000 x g for 5 min.\nRe-suspend the cell pellet with 5 ml of cell culture medium and remove a sample for counting cell numbers with a hemocytometer. Dilute the cells with cell culture medium to a density of 50,000 cells/ml. Add the diluted-cell suspensions into a 96-well cell culture plate (100 µl/well). Incubate the cells in a cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for 18 hr to allow cell attachment.\nDilute DOX dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution and DOX-PA DMSO solution with cell culture medium to obtain final drug concentrations of 0.1 µM, 0.5 µM, 2 µM, 5 µM, and 10 µM, respectively. Keep final DMSO concentration in all above samples to 0.5%. Dilute DOX-PA micelle with cell culture medium to obtain final drug concentrations of 0.1 µM, 0.5 µM, 2 µM, 5 µM, and 10 µM, respectively. Use the blank cell culture medium a control.\nRemove the 96-well cell culture plate from the incubator and replace the cell culture medium with 100 µl of medium containing different treatment agents prepared in step 3.3.5 (n = 4 for each group). Incubate the cells in the cell culture incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2) for an additional 72 hr.\nAspirate the medium and add 100 µl of medium containing 0.5 mg/ml of 3-(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT).\nIncubate the cells in the cell culture incubator for additional 2 hr. Carefully remove the medium and add 100 µl of DMSO to dissolve formazan crystals.",
    "Measure absorbance with the microplate spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 670 nm.\nCalculate the cell viability using the following equation:\nCell Viability (%) = (ATest  ⁄  Acontrol) × 100%\n\t\tNOTE: Compare the cell viability between different groups using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical test. Calculate the IC50 based on cell viability vs. drug concentration data.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
