    "1. Bioprinting Platform Establishment\nThe printer modification was based on a HP Deskjet 500 thermal inkjet printer and HP 51626a black ink cartridge.\nRemove the top plastic cover of the printer and carefully detach the control panel from the cover.\nDetach the 3 cable connections between the printer top portion and base. Remove the printer top portion from the base.\nOn the printer top portion, remove the small plastic and rubber accessories (printhead cleaning system) at the right hand side under the ink cartridge.\nRemove the base of the paper tray with springs.\nRemove the metallic plate covering the plastic paper feeding bar.\nCut off the plastic paper feeding bar at the middle feeding wheel position using a hand saw or other cutting tool.\nRemove the 2 paper feeding wheels exposed after the previous step. The wheel plastic is very hard and an electronic saw will be helpful.\nClean the dust and debris using canned air and ethanol wipes.\nAttach the printer top portion to the base.\nUV sterilize the modified printer for at least 2 hr in a laminar flow hood before using.\nCut off the cap of a HP 51626a ink cartridge using a hand saw or other cutting tool.\nEmpty the ink and remove the filter that covers the bottom well reservoir of the cartilage.\nRinse the cartridge thoroughly using running tap water.\nUltrasonicate the cartridge in de-ionized (DI) water for 10 min to remove the residual ink.\nExamine the cartridge to make sure all the ink has been removed. Rinse or spray the cartridge thoroughly with 70% ethanol for sterilization, followed by sterilized DI water.\nSet up a long-wavelength ultraviolet lamp over the printing platform to provide simultaneous photopolymerization capacity.",
    "Measure UV intensity at the printing platform using a UV light meter. Adjust the distance between the UV lamp and the printer platform so the intensity at the printing subject is between 4-8 mW/cm2 (approximately 25 cm from lamp to the printer platform).\n2. Bioink Preparation\nMonolayer chondrocyte expansion\n\t\nPlate 5 million human chondrocytes into each T175 tissue culture flask for cell expansion in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum and 1x penicillin-streptomycin-glutamine (PSG). Culture cells at 37 °C with humidified air containing 5% CO2. Change the culture medium every 3 days until the flask is 85% confluence. Use cells from the same passage.\nDissolve PEGDA in PBS to a final concentration of 10% w/v. Add photoinitiator I-2959 to a final concentration of 0.05% w/v. Filter sterilize the solution.\nSuspend cultured human chondrocytes in the prepared PEGDA solution at 5 x 106 cells/ml.\n3. Cartilage Tissue Printing\nTurn on the printer and laptop.\nCreate a printing pattern of a solid circle with 4 mm in diameter using Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop.\n\t\nAdjust the position of the pattern and make sure it will print exactly into the plastic mold.\nCalculate the number of prints needed to reach the desired thickness of scaffold. For 4 mm in height, 220 prints are required to create the desired scaffold.\nLoad the bioink into the ink cartridge. Cover the cartridge with aluminum foil to protect from the direct UV exposure during printing.\nSend printing command to the printer. Pull the paper sensor when the printer starts to print. The whole printing process should take less than 4 min for a scaffold with 4 mm in diameter and 4 mm in height.\nTransfer printed neocartilage to a 24-well plate and add 1.5 ml culture medium to each well.",
    "4. Cell Viability Evaluation in 3D Scaffold\nIncubate the printed neocartilage in LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity working solution at room temperature for 15 min in dark.\nCut the cell-laden hydrogel in half and take fluorescent images of the cutting area.\nCount live (green) and dead (red) cells by a blinded observer at five randomly taken images. Calculate cell viability by dividing the number of live cells by the total number of live and dead cells.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
