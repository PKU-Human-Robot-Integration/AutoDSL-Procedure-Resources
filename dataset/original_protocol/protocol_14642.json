    "1. Prepare Cell Culture Filter Inserts for Seeding HIBCPP Cells in an Inverted Model System\nPre-warm DMEM/ F12 (Ham) supplemented with 5 µg/ml insulin, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS).\nUse sterile forceps to place 0.33 cm² growth area cell culture filter inserts with a pore size of 3 µm upside down into a 12-well plate (Figure 1E).\nFill medium into the lower compartment of the cell culture filter insert (about 3 ml) and 100 µl on top of the filter insert. Flood the plate as well as the lower compartment with medium. Aspirate the excessive medium in such a way that the lower compartment of the filter insert stays filled (Figure 1E).\n\tNote: It is recommended to use a serological pipette for this step.\nCover 12-well plate with the lid and transfer the prepared cell culture filter inserts to the incubator, 37 °C, 5% CO2 until addition of cells.\n2. Cultivation and Passaging of HIBCPP Cells\nPrepare DMEM/ F12 (Ham) supplemented with 5 µg/ml, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin and 10% FCS.\nPre-warm medium and PBS in a 37 °C water bath. Aspirate medium from flask. Add 10 ml PBS to the flask and swirl. Repeat this step once.\nAdd 3 ml 0.25% trypsin-EDTA to the flask and swirl. Place into the incubator, 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nAfter approximately 20 min remove the flask from the incubator. Ensure that the cells are detached from the bottom of the flask and display a round shape when surveyed with the microscope.\n\tNote: The cells do not detach completely from each other and are often found in agglomerates. It is recommended to use the cells up to passage 38.",
    "To stop trypsinization add 17 ml medium. Resuspend the cells by pipetting up and down and transfer the suspension into a 50 ml tube. Centrifuge at 50 x g for 10 min at room temperature.\nResuspend the cells in an appropriate volume of medium and count the cells by using a hemocytometer.\n\tNote: The concentration of resuspended HIBCPP cells should be 1 x 106 cells/ml. For maintenance of HIBCPP cells it is suggested to transfer an amount of 1-6 x 106 cells in 10 ml medium to a T75-flask. Change medium every second day.\n3. Seeding Inverted Cell Culture Filter Inserts with HIBCPP Cells\nOn top of each inverted filter insert (i.e. the bottom side of the filter) add 80 µl of cell suspension (i.e. 8 x 104 cells) (Figure 1E).\n\tNote: Make sure that the cells are evenly distributed in the suspension by inverting the tube before seeding.\nCover the seeded-cell culture filter inserts with the lid of the 12-well plate and transfer to the incubator, 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nOn the first day, fill 1 ml medium into the wells of a 24-well plate. Lift the cell culture filter inserts by using forceps out of the 12-well plate, discard the medium inside, turn the filter inserts and place them in the standard orientation into the prepared 24-well plate (Figure 1E).\nPlace the cells into fresh medium every second day. Prepare 24-wells with fresh medium and transfer the filter inserts to it. Fill inserts with 0.5 ml fresh medium. Check TEER every day as described in section 4.",
    "When TEER values of HIBCPP seeded-cells on cell culture inserts exceeds 70 Ω x cm² (approximately 4 days after seeding), then continue cell culture in medium containing 1% FCS and 5 µg/ml insulin. Prepare 24-well plates with 1 ml medium for each well. Transfer filter inserts to the prepared wells and exchange medium in the upper compartment.\n\tNote: This serum withdrawal after confluency leads to the formation of a higher membrane potential.\nAspirate medium from filter compartment, transfer to the prepared well and fill with 500 µl medium. Repeat this step once. Put the cells overnight into the incubator, 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n4. Measurement of Transepithelial Electrical Resistance (TEER)\nImmerse the electrode tips of epithelial tissue voltohmmeter for 15 min in 80% ethanol. Transfer voltohmmeter under the hood and let electrode dry for a moment. Place electrode into respective culture medium used for the cells for another 15 min to equilibrate.\nPerform measurements by positioning the longer arm of the electrode so that it touches the bottom of the lower compartment each time, place the shorter arm into the filter insert compartment.\n\tNote: Resistance values of cell culture filter inserts without cells in medium should be used as blank values ((measured value (Ω) – blank value (Ω)) x filter surface (i.e. 0.33 cm²)).\nAfter measuring place the electrode back into 80% ethanol for 15 min. Store in a dry tube.\n5. Determination of Paracellular Permeability\nDissolve 1 g FITC-Inulin in 200 ml culture medium supplemented with 5 µg/ml insulin 1% FCS. Apply 50 µg/ml of the solution into the upper filter compartment before infection of the cells.\nAfter infection collect medium samples from the lower well to determine how much Inulin passed from the filter compartment through the cell layer.",
    "Prepare a FITC-Inulin standard solution and perform 1:2 dilutions, 10 times (100%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, 3.13%, 1.56%, 0.78%, 0.39%, 0.2% and 0%). Determine fluorescence by measurement of all samples in microplate reader.\n6. Preparation of Bacteria for Infection of HIBCPP Cells on Cell Culture Filter Inserts\nOne day prior to the experiment, scrape the frozen N. meningitidis strains off a glycerol-stock and streak out on Chocolate Agar with Vitox. Grow overnight in the incubator, at 37 °C, with 5% CO2.\nExtract 20-30 colonies from the overnight culture and transfer into a tube containing 8 ml Proteose Peptone Medium supplemented with 0.042% NaHCO3, 0.01 M MgCl2 and 1% Polyvitex.\nShake the bacteria for 1.25 hr at 220 rpm, 37 °C. Pellet the bacteria by centrifugation at 2,684 g for 10 min at room temperature. Discard supernatant and resuspend the bacterial pellet with 8 ml serum-free medium. Vortex to ensure an even suspension.\nTo determine culture density, measure a dilution of 1:10 at an optical density (OD) of 600 nm. Adjust the bacterial suspension to an OD600 of 0.1.\n\tNote: This suspension contains approx. 1 x 108 CFU/ml.\nTo confirm the bacterial cell concentration, dilute the suspension stepwise (1:10) up to a dilution of 10-5 and plate onto Chocolate Agar plates.\n\tNote: Similar serial dilutions need to be performed to calculate bacterial growth curves.\n7. Infection of HIBCPP Cells on Cell Culture Filter Inserts and Determination of Bacterial Invasion by Double Immunofluorescence\nAfter continuing cell culture in medium containing 1% FCS and 5 µg/ml insulin, measure cells every day using an epithelial tissue voltohmmeter. If cells have reached a TEER of around 500 Ω x cm² , carry out the infection.",
    "Infect the cells with the prepared bacterial suspension at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Store the infected cells in the incubator, at 37 °C, with 5% CO2 for the indicated period of time.\n\tNote: The MOI can be calculated by taking into account the number of cells per cell culture filter insert at confluence (1.21 x 106 cells/cm2).\nStop the infection by washing three times with 500 µl serum-free medium (SFM) containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) applied to the filter compartment, 1 ml to the lower compartment.\nBlock with 500 µl SFM containing 1% BSA buffer in the filter compartment and 1 ml in the lower compartment for 20 min at room temperature to prevent adherence of antibodies to unspecific binding sites.\nIncubate with 100 µl primary antibody anti N. meningtidis α-OMP (1:200) in the filter compartment and 500 µl in the lower compartment for 20 min at room temperature.\n\tNote: If required, the antibody concentration needs to be titrated.\nWash the cells by aspirating the medium from the filter compartment, transfer the filter insert to a prepared well with 1 ml SFM containing 1% BSA and fill the emptied filter compartment with 500 µl SFM containing 1% BSA. Repeat this step twice.\nFix cells with 500 µl 4% formaldehyde in the filter compartment, 1 ml in the lower compartment for 10 min at room temperature.\nWash the cells by aspirating the medium from the filter compartment, transfer the filter insert to a prepared well with 1 ml PBS and fill the emptied filter compartment with 500 µl PBS. Repeat this step once.\n\tNote: Samples can be stored overnight in PBS at 4 °C.",
    "Cut fixed cell culture filters out of the inserts and wash with 250 µl PBS containing 1% BSA. Incubate cells for 15 min at room temperature with 250 µl fluorescent labeled (excitation wavelength 594 nm) secondary antibody chicken anti rabbit (1:500) to stain extracellular bacteria.\n\tNote: If required, the antibody concentration needs to be titrated.\nPermeabilize cells with 250 µl PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 hr at room temperature. Wash cells three times with 250 µl PBS containing 1% BSA.\nIncubate with 250 µl primary antibody anti N. meningitidis α-OMP (1:200) for 30 min to stain extra- and intracellular bacteria. Wash cells three times with 250 µl PBS containing 1% BSA.\nApply 250 µl of fluorescent labeled (excitation wavelength 488 nm) secondary antibody (1:500), fluorescent labeled (excitation wavelength 660 nm) Phalloidin (1:250) and 4´,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) (1:50,000) for 1 hr at room temperature to stain extra- and intracellular bacteria, actin cytoskeleton and nuclei.\n\tNote: If required, the antibody concentration needs to be titrated.\nWash cells three times with 250 µl PBS containing 1% BSA. Embed the cells in mounting medium and store at 4 °C until examination via microscope.\nDetermine number of invaded bacteria per predefined field. Do this by counting 20 fields per filter membrane. Calculate the percentage of invaded bacteria.\n\tNote: Multiply the mean bacterial count of the 20 microscopic fields with an area coefficient. The result expresses the amount of total bacteria present in a 0.33 cm² cell culture filter insert. Divide this value by the amount of bacteria grown in media during the duration of infection.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
