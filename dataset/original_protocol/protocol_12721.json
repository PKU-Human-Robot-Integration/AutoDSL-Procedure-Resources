  "procedures": [
    "Work involving mice was approved by the University of Virginia Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC; #4112).\n1. Generate a Non-random XCI Mouse Model with Genetically Labeled Mecp2 on Xi\nNOTE: Mouse strains used in the study were as follows: Mecp2-Gfp/Mecp2-Gfp (Mecp2tm3.1Bird, Table of Materials) and Xist/ΔXist (B6;129-Xist<tm5Sado>; provided by Antonio Bedalov, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle). Breeding strategies among the respective strains have been designed to expand the mouse colonies for each strain.\nPerform PCR-genotyping on all mice strains and respective progenies obtained after breeding using gene specific primers listed in Table 1.\n2. Design the Mouse Breeding Strategy to Generate XistΔ:Mecp2/Xist:Mecp2-Gfp\nSet up a breeding pair by housing a Mecp2-Gfp/Y male and a XistΔ-Mecp2/Xist-Mecp2 female together (12 h/12 h: light / dark cycle)  (Figure 1A). Ideally, set up at least 5 breeding pairs at a time using viable and fertile mice. After the pregnant female gives birth, allow her to raise her first litter with the male.\nNOTE: Because paternal Xist knockout impairs imprinted XCI, dosage compensation, and differentiation pathways17, the use of XistΔ-Mecp2/Y mice in the breeding will fail to produce the female pups with required genotype.\nAfter weaning the litter at post-natal day 21 (P21), identify and tag the XistΔ:Mecp2/Xist:Mecp2-Gfp female pups using a PCR-based genotyping assay (Figure 1B).\nNOTE: In terms of the number of animals needed per group, for the results reported below, 5 breeding pairs were set up which generated approximately 10 female XistΔ:Mecp2/Xist:Mecp2-Gfp mice.\nUse female mouse models for all the proposed experiments.\nNOTE: Sex is an important biological variable for XCI studies, and the male model does not account for the confounding effects of random XCI.",
    "To be consistent throughout the animal studies and rule out any effects of the animal age, perform all the experiments in 5−8-week-old female XistΔ:Mecp2/Xist:Mecp2-Gfp mice.\n3. Isolate Female XistΔ:Mecp2/Xist:Mecp2-Gfp Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs)\nSet up timed mating between the Mecp2-Gfp/Y male and XistΔ-Mecp2/Xist-Mecp2 female. Set up at least 3−4 mating cages to increase the likelihood of pregnancy.\nAfter confirming the vaginal plug the morning after mating, separate the female and this day is considered embryonic day 0.5 (E0.5). Monitor the weight gain of the prospective pregnant female and visually inspect the abdomen of the mice to confirm pregnancy. On E14.5−15.5, euthanize the pregnant female mice via cervical dislocation.\nUnder a laminar hood, wipe the abdomen of the pregnant female with 70% ethanol. Using sterile scissors, dissect the abdominal cavity and remove the uterine horns containing the embryos. Using forceps, gently take out the embryos while cutting off the remaining abdominal tissue (6−12 embryos is usually expected).\nPlace the uterine horns containing the embryos in a 10 mm tissue-culture dish. Using sterile scissors and forceps, make an incision along the uterine horns to isolate individual sacs carrying an embryo. Carefully, place the uterine horns containing the rest of the embryos in 30 mL of sterile Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) on ice.\nGently cut open the sac and isolate the embryo using sterile scissors and forceps. Remove the placenta by cutting the umbilical cord.\nDecapitate the embryo.\nNOTE: While the rest of the embryonic tissue will be further processed, the tissue from the embryo head will be used to isolate DNA for genotyping.\nOpen the abdomen by cutting the midline of the embryo using sterile scissors and forceps. Remove the visceral organs, such as the heart, liver, and lungs.",
    "Transfer the remaining embryonic tissue into a sterile 60 mm tissue-culture plate and cut into small pieces using scissors or a razor blade. To break open the cell clumps, add 3 mL of trypsin-EDTA (0.05%) and incubate at 37 °C for 15 min.\nNeutralize trypsin-EDTA by adding 5 mL of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10 µg/mL penicillin/streptomycin (pen/strep) to the plate and dissociate the tissue by repetitive pipetting (approximately 20−30 times).\nSpin down cells at 300 x g for 5 min and re-suspend the cell pellet in 4 mL of DMEM with 10% FBS and 10 µg/mL pen/strep. Plate the cells on a 60 mm culture dish, and culture the cells at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2.\nCarry out steps 3.5−3.10 for each embryo.\nCulture MEFs obtained in step 3.11 for at least 3−4 days.\nNOTE: At this stage, MEFs can also be cryopreserved for future experiments.\nTo determine the sex and genotype of each embryo, carry out genotyping-PCR using DNA isolated from the heads of the embryos using primers and PCR conditions listed in Table 1.\n4. Confirm the Lack of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) Expression in the Brain of XistΔ:Mecp2/Xist:Mecp2-Gfp Mice Using a Ffluorescence Activated Cell Sorting-based Assay\nUsing scissors, separate the cerebral cortex from the rest of the brain hemispheres, and place in 1 mL of ice-cold nuclei isolation media (NIM) buffer containing 250 mM sucrose, 25 mM potassium chloride (KCl), 5 mM magnesium chloride (MgCl2), 10 mM Tris-Cl, supplemented with 2% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and 0.1% nonionic surfactant (Table of Materials).\nHomogenize using an ice-cold glass homogenizer.\nSpin down homogenized tissue at 600 x g, 4 °C for 5 min.\nRemove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1 mL of 25% iodixanol in NIM solution.",
    "Add 1 mL of 29% lodixanol in NIM solution to a 4 mL ultracentrifuge tube (store on ice until samples are ready) and carefully layer 1 mL of sample (in 25% lodixanol).\nCentrifuge at 9,000 x g, 4 °C for 10 min in an ultracentrifuge.\nAspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 500 μL of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] supplemented with 1 mM EDTA, 0.05% sodium azide, and 2% bovine serum albumin [BSA]).\nNOTE: Samples can be stored at 4 °C or up to 1 week.\nAdd 5 μL of 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD; 50 mg/mL) for 5 min at room temperature to stain DNA.\nAnalyze samples for 7-AAD and green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal using flow cytometry.\n5. Determine Feasibility of the XistΔ:Mecp2/Xist:Mecp2-Gfp Mouse Model for Xi Reactivation\nSeed 1 x 105 cells/mL female XistΔ:Mecp2/Xist:Mecp2-Gfp MEFs, Mecp2/Mecp2-Gfp and Xist-Mecp2/Y MEFs obtained in step 3.12 in a 6-well format and in chamber slides, in DMEM with 10% FBS and 10 µg/mL pen/strep, at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2.\nNOTE: Mecp2/Mecp2-Gfp and Xist-Mecp2/Y MEFs are used as positive and negative controls in the experiments.\nAdd fresh medium to the cells after 24 h. For XistΔ:Mecp2/Xist:Mecp2-Gfp MEFs, add medium supplemented with XCIFs inhibitors (e.g., 0.5 μM LDN193189 and 2.5 μM GSK650394), or vehicle alone. Replace medium supplemented with fresh inhibitor or vehicle alone every 2 days. For Mecp2/Mecp2-Gfp and Xist-Mecp2/Y MEFs, add fresh medium every 2 days.\nPost 1 week of inhibitor treatment, harvest MEFs either for RNA isolation (6-well plate) or fix cells for immunofluorescence (chamber slides). Use MEFs isolated from Mecp2/Mecp2-Gfp embryos as positive and Xist-Mecp2/Y embryos as negative controls respectively.",
    "For RNA isolation, isolate total RNA by guanidinium thiocyanate-based RNA extraction reagent, and reverse transcribe using reverse transcriptase. Measure Mecp2-Gfp expression by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) using Mecp2-WT and Mecp2-GFP, and primers listed in Table 1, as described previously12.\nFor immunofluorescence, stain MEFs with an anti-GFP primary antibody (1:100), as described previously12,16. Measure GFP intensity by quantitative immunofluorescence in drug treated XistΔ:Mecp2/Xist:Mecp2-Gfp MEFs, as described previously18.\n6. Demonstrate the Pharmacological Xi Reactivation in the Brain of the XistΔ:Mecp2/Xist:Mecp2-Gfp Mouse Model\nPrepare drugs and vehicle control.\nPrepare a fresh, sterile solution of vehicle (0.9% NaCl, 0.5% methylcellulose, 4.5% dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]) for brain injections.\nPrepare chemical inhibitors including 1.5 mM LDN193189 (small molecule inhibitor of ACVR1) and 1.6 mM GSK650394 (small molecule inhibitor of SGK1, a downstream effector of PDPK1) re-suspended in vehicle (0.9% NaCl, 0.5% methylcellulose, 4.5% DMSO), or vehicle alone. The total volume of chemical inhibitors or vehicle injected is 10 µL per dose per animal.\nPrepare animal for brain injections.\nPrepare the surgical area by wiping the bench and heating pad with disinfectant (10% sodium hypochlorite solution).\nAnesthetize the 4 week old mouse with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine/xylazine mixture at a dose of 140 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, respectively. Use the pedal withdrawal reflex to determine the level of anesthesia.\nApply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes following induction of anesthesia to prevent corneal drying.\nShave off the fur from the neck to the top of the head of the mouse.\nPosition the mouse in the stereotactic platform by hooking the mouse’s incisor teeth in the bite bar of the snout restrainer and tightening the nose clamp over the snout while ensuring that the mouse’s head is on a level plane.",
    "Adjust the height of the ear bars, as necessary, to reach the caudal portion of the ear canal, securing them such that the mouse’s head is in a level plane and immobilized on finger touch.\nDisinfect the head of the mouse with alternating wipes of a topical antiseptic, such as povidone-iodine and 70% ethanol.\nAdminister drugs.\nUsing a sterile scalpel, make a 0.75 cm horizontal incision in the mid-scalp.\nUsing a 0.45 mm burr, drill two symmetrical holes above the right and left cortical hemispheres (2 mm from the sagittal suture and 2 mm from the lambdoid suture, approximately the middle of parietal bone).\nAttach a 10 μL syringe to the stereotactic platform firmly.\nMix the solution of chemical inhibitors, and draw 10 μL of solution into the syringe. Avoid any air bubbles in the syringe.\nAdvance the syringe needle into the burr hole maintaining the needle perpendicular (90°) to the skull. When the needle traverses the skull, zero out the coordinates on the stereotactic digital display and then advance the tip of the needle until it reaches a depth of 2.5 mm.\nWithdraw the needle 0.5 mm to the depth for 2 mm.\nSlowly inject 10 μL of solution (~1 min). After injection is complete, leave the needle in the brain for ~1 min and then withdraw the needle.\nRepeat the injection for the second hemisphere (vehicle only control).\nUsing sutures or “skin glue” close the skin of the mouse (if wound is > 0.5cm both sutures and “skin glue” should be used).\nLoosen the ear bars and remove the mouse from the stereotactic apparatus.\nAdminister analgesics (Buprenorphine SR 0.5 mg/kg IP) and place the mouse on a heating pad set to 37 °C until the animal regains consciousness.",
    "Once the mouse is alert and responsive, transfer the animal back to its original cage.\nRepeat the procedure every 2 days for 20 days. Repeat drilling of the area is not required for subsequent injections.\nIsolate the mouse brain.\nOnce the dose regimen is completed, euthanize the mouse in a CO2 chamber.\nImmobilize the mouse on a surface using needles.\nMake a lateral incision through the integument and abdominal wall just beneath the rib cage using scissors and forceps. Carefully separate the liver from the diaphragm.\nUsing scissors, cut the diaphragm and continue cutting along the entire length of the rib cage to expose the pleural cavity.\nUsing scissors, make an incision to the posterior end of the left ventricle.\nImmediately, start injecting the right heart chamber with ~15 mL of PBS over ~2 min. Liver color change from red to pale pink is indicative of good perfusion.\nInject the right chamber of the mouse heart with ~10 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS over ~2 min.\nDecapitate the mouse, and use scissors to make a midline incision of the scalp to expose the skull.\nPlace one tip of the scissors into the foramen magnum, and cut laterally into the skull toward the eye. Repeat for the other side. Try to keep the end of the scissors as superficial as possible to avoid injury of the brain.\nUse scissors to cut the region between the eyes and above the nose of the mouse.\nUse forceps to gently peel the cranial bones from the brain hemispheres.\nLift the brain with a spatula, and use scissors to carefully dissect the cranial nerve fibers that fix it to the skull.",
    "Place the brain on a plastic dish, cut out the cerebellum and olfactory bulbs, and place the brain into a 15 mL tube filled with 4% PFA is PBS.\nCryo-section the mouse brain.\nFix brain in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C overnight.\nRinse the brain with PBS at 4 °C at least 3x for 5 min each.\nLabel the disposable molds for cryopreserving the tissues.\nCut out the front of the brain using scissors and forceps (start making ~5 mm sections from injection sites).\nTransfer the brain to the cryomold with the front of the brain facing down to obtain coronal sections. Submerge the mold containing brain in the optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT).\nPour liquid nitrogen into a 10 mm plastic petri dish and place the brain in the cryo-mold into the nitrogen.\nNOTE: It is important to orient the tissue as described in step 6.5.5 to guide the sectioning of the brain.\nWhen the OCT is solid white, place the frozen brain into an -80 °C freezer for storage.\nEquilibrate the brain to -20 °C for at least 30 min prior to sectioning with cryostat and cryosection (5−6 μm thickness) the brain, mounting 2−3 sections per slide. Slides can be stored at -80 °C for later use.\nDetermine Xi reactivation using an immunofluorescence-based approach.\nBefore starting the staining procedure, dry the brain sections overnight at 4 °C.\nImmerse slides in antigen retrieval solution (0.1 M citric acid, 0.1 M Tris-base, pH = 6.0) on a 100 °C heat block for 5 min.\nWash slides 4x with 1x PBS for 5 min each at room temperature.\nImmerse slides in blocking solution (0.1 M NH4Cl/PBS/0.2% gelatin/0.05% nonionic surfactant) for 20 min at room temperature.",
    "Wash slides 3x with wash buffer (PBS/0.2% gelatin) at room temperature for 5 min each.\nStain brain sections with anti-GFP-AlexaFluor647 (1:100) and anti-MAP2 (1:1,000) antibodies in incubation medium (PBS/0.2% gelatin/1% BSA) and incubate at 4 °C overnight.\nCollect primary antibodies (can be reused). Wash slides 4x with wash buffer for a total of 30 min at room temperature.\nIncubate brain sections with goat anti-chicken Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled secondary antibody (1:1,000) in incubation medium and incubate 1−2 h at room temperature in the dark.\nWash slides 4x with wash buffer for a total of 30 min at room temperature.\nPlace a drop of mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) on a 22 mm x 50 mm coverslip, then invert the coverslip onto a slide, covering all tissue sections.\nImage on a microscope and adjust images for contrast and brightness. Capture images and quantify the number of GFP-positive cells for both drug-treated and vehicle treated XistΔ:Mecp2/Xist:Mecp2-Gfp mouse brain hemispheres.\nSubscription Required.
