    "1. Preparation of the Cas12a plasmids\nNOTE: The plasmid containing the Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 Cas12a (LbCpf1, pCSN067) codon optimized for expression in S. cerevisiae, was previously constructed19, deposited at a plasmid repository (see the Table of Materials). This is a single-copy episomal S. cerevisiae/E. coli shuttle plasmid containing a KanMX resistance marker gene to allow for selection of S. cerevisiae transformants on geneticin (G418).\nObtain the pCSN067 plasmid (see the Table of Materials).\nAmplify the pCSN067 plasmid to obtain a high amount.\n\t\nTransform 25 µL of purchased chemically competent E. coli cells with the plasmid pCSN067 according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Dilute the transformation mix 10 and 50 times in 2x peptone-yeast (PY). Plate out 10x and 50x dilutions on 2x PY agar plates containing ampicillin (0.1 g/L) and incubate overnight at 37 °C.\nPick 2 to 3 colonies and inoculate each colony in 3 mL of 2x PY and grow overnight at 37 °C in a shaking incubator at 180 rpm.\nPurify the plasmid using a plasmid purification kit according to manufacturer's instructions.\n2. Preparation of the single crRNA array expression cassette\nPrepare the single crRNA array.",
    "NOTE: The single crRNA array comprises an SNR52 RNA polymerase III promoter from S. cerevisiae2, a direct repeat specific for LbCas12a and a spacer (genomic target sequence), together repeated for each target19 and ends with a SUP4 terminator from S. cerevisiae2. The single crRNA array is assembled by in vivo recombination into the linearized plasmid pRN1120 to generate a circular plasmid, thus regions homologous to plasmid pRN1120 must be present at the start and end of the single crRNA array (see Figure 2A). It is recommended to in advance evaluate the functionality of a number of designed crRNAs separately19. This information is subsequently used to select most functional crRNAs to combine these into the direct repeat and spacer sequences to create a single crRNA array for the multiplexing purpose.\n\t\nOrder the single crRNA array for multiplex genome editing experiments as synthetic DNA (see the DNA sequence of the single crRNA array in Supplementary Table 1).\nAmplify the ordered single crRNA array (e.g., using primers KC-101 and KC-102 (Supplemental Table 2)).

This multi-copy plasmid contains a NatMX resistance marker gene to allow selection of S. cerevisiae transformants on nourseothricin (NTC).\n\t\nObtain the pRN1120 plasmid.\nAmplify the pRN1120 plasmid to obtain a high amount.\n\t\t\nTransform 25 µL of purchased chemically competent E. coli cells with plasmid pRN1120 according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

    "Analyze the linearized plasmid by electrophoresis on an agarose gel (0.8%, 40 min, 5 V/cm) using a DNA loading dye and DNA ladder with DNA fragments in a range of 100 to 10,000 bp. As a control include a circular plasmid in the analysis.\nPurify the linearized plasmid using a PCR purification kit according to the instructions of the manufacturer.\n3.
