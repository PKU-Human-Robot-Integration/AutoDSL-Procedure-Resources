    "All steps are performed at room temperature, unless otherwise indicated.\n1. Enucleation and Fixation of Postnatal Eyes\nPlace humanely killed mouse pup on its side, remove the skin covering the eye with scissors.\nUse scissors and forceps to enucleate the eye.\nPlace scissors below the enucleated eye, cut the optic nerve and surrounding tissues and lift out the eye. Transfer to a 24-well plate containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) made up in 2x PBS at room temperature.\nAllow each eye to fix for 10 - 15 min, then transfer to cold 2x PBS on ice for 5 - 10 min. It is best to stagger enucleations and subsequent fixation to ensure the degree of fixation is equal for each eye.\n2. Dissection of Postnatal Murine Retinas\nTransfer eyes into a Petri dish containing 2x PBS using a plastic Pasteur pipette that has been cut to widen the bore and place under a dissecting microscope.\nRemove any fat around the eye using forceps and scissors.\nPierce the edge of the cornea with sharp scissors and cut around the cornea and iris and discard.\nInsert forceps between retina and sclera and remove the sclera taking care not to tear the retina. The choroid layer can also be removed, but if there is a risk of damage to the retina occurring during this step, the choroid layer can be left on as it should not significantly affect the quality of the immunostaining.\nRemove the lens and the vitreous humour using forceps.\nRemove the hyaloids vessels by gathering them together in the center of the eye with fine forceps then quickly pull away from the center of the retina (alternatively snip at base of hyaloid vessels with fine scissors).\nRinse the cup shaped retina with PBS in a clean Petri dish.",
    "Make 4 to 5 radial incisions reaching approximately 2/3 of the radius of the retina using spring scissors to create a 'petal' shape.\nDraw off PBS using a Pasteur pipette to flatten the retina, and then remove any excess PBS with a small piece of absorbent paper.\nSlowly pipette cold (-20 °C) methanol drop by drop onto surface of retina until totally covered and then flood with additional methanol. This will help to fix the retinas and will facilitate permeabilization. The retinas will turn white.\nTransfer to a 2 ml tube using a plastic Pasteur pipette that has been cut to widen the bore.\nLeave retina in cold methanol for at least 20 min before proceeding with immunostaining. Of the antibodies used here, only VE-Cadherin cannot be used successfully on methanol fixed retinas. In this case retinas need to proceed straight to immunostaining after step 9.\nIf required, retinas can be stored in methanol at -20 °C for up to several months prior to staining.\n3. Immuno/isolectin Staining of the Retinal Vasculature\nCarefully remove/pour off methanol and gently rinse retinas briefly in PBS (at this stage the retina is still in the same 2 ml tube from step 11 above).\nRemove PBS and cover retinas with 100 μl of Perm/Block solution (PBS + 0.3% Triton + 0.2% BSA) + 5% of appropriate serum (see Table 1) and shake gently for 1 hr.\nRemove Perm/Block and incubate retinas with gentle shaking overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of selected primary antibodies (see Table 1) and/or IsolectinB4, all prepared by diluting in Perm/Block.\nRemove antibody/isolectin and wash retinas 4 x 10 min in PBS + 0.3% Triton (PBSTX).",
    "In some cases, e.g. following staining with IsolectinB4-Alexa488 or a directly conjugated primary antibody, a secondary antibody is not required and retinas can be mounted directly (step 7). When an unconjugated primary antibody has been used in step 3, then 100 μl of the appropriate fluorescent secondary antibody (diluted 1/200 in PBSTX) is added and left to incubate overnight at 4 °C or for 4 hr at room temperature.\nRemove secondary antibody and wash retinas 4 x 15 min in 2 ml PBSTX.\nTransfer retinas onto slides using a wide bore plastic Pasteur pipette and remove excess PBSTX with absorbant tissue. Mount retinas by adding 50 μl of Prolong mountant onto a coverslip and gently position over the retina.\nTransfer slides to fridge overnight at 4 °C, ensuring that they are flat and protected from light, to allow the Prolong mountant to set.\nImage retina using a confocal microscope or an epifluorescence microscope.\nSubscription Required.
