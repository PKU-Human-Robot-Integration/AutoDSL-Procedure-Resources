  "title": "Assessing the Coherence of Parents' Short Narratives Regarding their Child Using the Five-Minute Speech Sample Procedure",
  "procedures": [
    "The Human Research Review Board of the University of California Riverside, CA, USA and the University of Haifa, Israel, approved the procedures described here. This paper is an introduction to the FMSS procedure and its coherence coding. Using it requires further training provided by the author upon request.\n1. The FMSS procedure20\nThis paper presents only the main steps of the FMSS procedure. Using the FMSS protocol requires its author’s20 permission.\nEquipment\nKeep a voice recorder, stop-watch and word processing software ready.\nInterview procedure\nSit with the parent in a quiet room. Administer the FMSS as the first measure to collect from the parent.\nTurn on the audio recorder and ask the parent: “For the next 5 minutes, please tell me about your thoughts and feelings regarding your child. Please tell me what kind of a person your child is and how the two of you get along together.” Turn on the stop-watch to count the 5 min.\nIf the parent falls silent for 30 s or longer, offer the following prompt (only once): “Please tell me anything about your child for a few more minutes.”\n2. FMSS transcribing protocol\nTranscribe the FMSS, starting from the instructions given to the parent. This will enable coders to take into consideration interviewers’ drifts from the protocol, which may affect the quality of the parental narrative.\nDocument in the transcript any of the following: changes in the parent’s tone of voice (e.g., “laughs”; “changes tone of voice to mimic the child”); length of pauses in parent’s speech (e.g., “20 seconds pause”); and external interruptions during the 5 min (e.g., “a phone rings for 10 seconds”).\nIf the parent spoke for more than 5 min, mark when the 5 min ended.\nInsert continuous line numbers to facilitate coders’ consensus discussions.",
    "3. The FMSS-Coherence coding method\nNOTE: The complete manual that includes seven 7-point rating scales can be obtained from the author. Low and high scores of the scales and examples of coded FMSS are presented herein as an introduction to the coding system.\nStep 1: Rating six components of coherence\nFor each of the following six subscales, use “+” or “-” signs throughout the transcribed FMSS to mark segments that reflect the subscales positively or negatively. Based on these “+” and “-” signs, determine a score for each subscale according to the following guidelines.\nFocus:\n\t\t\nAssign a high score when the parent refers to the child and/or to their relationship as the focal subject of the FMSS.\nAssign a low score when the parent refers to other matters for the majority of the FMSS, or narrates about her/his children as a whole instead of focusing on the target child, e.g., “... I believe my schedule varies from the other jobs, so I usually work on Tuesday nights, Wednesday nights and Thursday nights, some weekends, but usually I get a Monday off and Friday off. I work two jobs, um 7:30 to 4:30 and the other one from 5:30 to about 8:30.”\nElaboration:\n\t\t\nAssign a high score when the parent provides detailed and rich descriptions of the child and/or the relationship.",
    "Assign a low score when the FMSS is laconic and includes only a few brief sentences, e.g., “He is a friendly boy. He is a good boy, there isn’t anything special I could say about him. He takes an active part in the family and in school, he is a very good boy. He takes an active part in other settings as well. At home also. I don’t know what else to say. This is it. This is his personality. There is nothing unusual about him.”\nSeparateness:\n\t\t\nAssign a high score when the parent describes the child as having a distinct personality with needs and desires that are different from her/his own.\nAssign a low score when the parent shows difficulties in describing the child as a separate entity, e.g., “We are phenomenally close; we’re very touchy feely mother. I kiss her I hold her I bathe with her. I’m proud that she’s not afraid to show that she loves me anywhere anytime…she kisses me and holds me.”\nAssign a low score also when the parent shows boundary dissolution, namely, describes the parent’s and child’s roles as equal or reversed. For example, “I can consult with him more than with any of my close friends, even more than with my husband. I can ask him questions that are very personal. If I need something, I know I can go to him…he is not always available to me, but if I really need him, he is there for me.”\nConcern: \n​Assign a low score when the parent does not articulate worries or concerns.",
    "Assign a high score when the parent refers several times to characteristics of the child or the relationship that concern her/him, e.g., “I am concerned about his social skills. I am worried that he doesn’t have any close friends. I think it’s affecting his self-confidence. He keeps to himself a lot and I am worried about it. I don’t know what to do, I just don’t know what to do.”\nReverse code the score given in Concern, as a low score is a positive marker of coherence.\nAcceptance/rejection:\n\t\t\nAssign a high score when the parent speaks lovingly of the child, is pleased and proud with the child's accomplishments, and displays empathy for the child's weaknesses and negative behaviors.\nAssign a low score when the parent expresses rejection, disappointment, devaluation or a judgmental stance regarding the child, even if she/he also shows a few expressions of affection, e.g., “Um she’s crazy (laughs). She is a little hyper. She cries when she doesn’t get her way. She does very good in school, can do her homework on her own… but she is in everybody’s business all the time and tries to be her teacher’s pet.”\nComplexity: \n​Assign a high score when the parent addresses both positive and negative aspects of the child or the relationship in different contexts and provides supporting examples for most of her/his statements.",
    "Assign a low score when the parent provides a unidimensional portrayal that focuses only on positive, or primarily negative or concerning aspects of the child and the relationship, or when the parent does not provide examples from everyday life to support her/his statements, e.g., “She is a charming girl, a very good girl. Compare to other children that I see around, she listens, she understands, she is very clever, she is polite. She is really a very good child. We have a strong relationship. That’s it, I have nothing else to add.”\nStep 2: Rating the coherence of the FMSS \nRead the FMSS again, mark contradictions in the text, and go over the scores assigned in step 1 to integrate impression of the FMSS as a whole.\nAssign a high score when the FMSS was rated as high in focus, elaboration, separateness, concern (reverse scored), acceptance and complexity, and provided a consistent portrayal of the child and the relationship.\nAssign a low-moderate score when the parent provided a description of the child or the relationship, but the FMSS was rated as low in focus, elaboration, separateness, concern (reverse scored), acceptance or complexity or if it included contradictory statements.\nAssign a low score when the FMSS did not provide a description of the child or the relationship.\nStep 3: Data analyses\n\tNOTE: Depending on the research question, check if the continuous coherence 1–7 scores can be used or convert the scores into dichotomized coherent (score of 5 or higher) versus incoherent (score of 4 or lower) categories.\n\t \nCoding example 1: A section of a transcribed FMSS of a mother of an 8-year-old boy.\n\t1 “Ok, Joseph did very well last year at school. He got attendance awards and was one of the",
    "2 highest students in his class in reading and got a silver medal. He’s very friendly and outgoing.\n\t3 He comes home from school and tells me that a new kid started, and that he made friends with\n\t4 him and so um I’m very proud of him that he will go up and talk to other kids that don’t know\n\t5 anybody else. And at home he helps out he’s, out of all my kids, he wants to help the most. He\n\t6 likes to help clean and I’m just excited that he’s very go getter and hopefully he stays that way.\n\t7 Umm he fights with his brother a lot because they share a room and his brother likes to mess\n\t8 up the room and of course Joseph feels responsible to clean it up because he’s the older one.\n\t9 and now he’s starting to want to go and hang out with his friends. He’s got a friend that lives\n\t10 across the street and he goes over there a lot and he’ll spend the night a couple times a week\n\t11 um this summer and um I don’t know. He’s just becoming more confident and very outgoing\n\t12 which is so exciting cause he used to be so shy and didn’t want to talk to anybody before.\n\t13 (30 second pause) Please tell me anything about Joseph just for a few more minutes. \n\t14 Um he has been helping his dad out in the garden. We have like a garden in the backyard and\n\t15 he likes to go out and help pick vegetables, pull the weeds and help water.”\n\t\nAssign a high score in Focus, as the mother talks only about the child (no “-” signs).",
    "For Elaboration, denote a “+” next to the following: doing well in school (lines 1–2); very friendly and outgoing (lines 3–5), helps (lines 5–6) fights with sibling (lines 7–8), hangs out with friends (lines 9–11), helps dad (lines 14–15). Accordingly, assign a high score in Elaboration.\nAssign a high score in Separateness, as there are no separateness issues (no “-” signs).\nAssign a low score in Concern, as the mother does not articulate any worries or concerns (no “-” signs), and reverse code the score from low to high.\nFor Acceptance, denote a “+” near the following: the mother is proud (line 4), excited to see improvement in the child’s behavior (line 12), when relating to a negative behavior she expresses an understanding (lines 7–8). Accordingly, assign a high score in Acceptance.\nAssign a high score in Complexity, as the mother describes different child’s characteristics (school performance, relationships with peers and family), relates to his strength (did well in school, friendly and outgoing, helps) and weaknesses (fights with sibling, used to be shy) and supports her statements with examples.\nRate the FMSS as high in Coherence, based on the scores given in the above subscales as well as lack of contradictions in the text.\nCoding example 2: A section of a transcribed FMSS of a mother of a 4-year-old boy diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).\n\t1 “James is a loveable child, not only I love him, his father and his sister also love him very much.\n\t2 He used to get upset easily, perhaps it’s because it was hard for him to express his emotions\n\t3 and thoughts, but now he speaks better, in short sentences, but it is easier now to understand",
    "4 him. His relationship with his sister and cousins has also improved. He loves to play with them.\n\t5 When he was younger it was difficult because he did not know how to play and ended up alone.\n\t6 But now he succeeds more, which is great. I noticed that it helps him if we explain to him in\n\t7 advance what’s going to happen. For example, if I want to go with him to the zoo, I will talk\n\t8 with him about it before we leave home. If I don’t prepare him and try to drive in a route that\n\t9 is not the one that he takes every day, he will start screaming. It’s not that everything is easy,\n\t10 for example, yesterday I returned home very tired from work. He wanted something but I just\n\t11 couldn’t figure out what he wanted. We tried to talk, but we just couldn’t communicate. He\n\t12 became upset and screamed and cried and I was also very upset, and he probably noticed it.\n\t13 I hugged him and kissed him until he calmed down and then I told him let’s try again, and this\n\t14 time we succeeded. I understood what he wanted. So there are moments in which we still\n\t15 experience difficulties but I see improvement all the time. What else? He likes to play with\n\t16 other children, he is good in “catch” games. For example, last weekend we visited friends and\n\t17 he played “catch” with their daughter so nicely. We really enjoyed watching them. So more\n\t18 and more there are moments in which I say to myself that he is growing to be an easy child.”",
    "Assign a high score in Focus, as the mother narrates solely on the target child (no “-” signs).\nFor Elaboration, denote a “+” next to the detailed examples of the following: there is improvement in child's behavior (lines 3–4, 6), they still experience some difficulties (lines 10–14); and the child is good in \"catch\" (lines 16–17). Accordingly, assign a high score in Elaboration.\nAssign a high score in Separateness, as there are no indicators of difficulties in separateness and the mother describes the child as a separate person, with needs and desires that are different from her own (no “-” signs).\nAssign a low score in Concern, as no “-” signs are denoted. The mother is not overwhelmed with concern. She describes the child difficulties, which are probably related to his ASD diagnosis, but emphasizes the improvements she sees in the child's behavior and their relationship (lines 3–4, 6, 15, 18), and communicates a sense of competence in parenting the child and helping him acquire more adaptive behaviors (lines 6–7, 13–14).\nReverse the concern score from low to high.\nFor Acceptance, denote a “+” near the following: the mother’s expression of warmth (lines 1, 13, 18), enjoyment in the child’s strength and development (lines 6, 17), and expression of empathy and understanding when describing the child’s negative behaviors (lines 2, 6–8, 13). Accordingly, and as there are no sign of rejection (no “-” signs), assign a high score in Acceptance.",
    "Assign a high score in Complexity, as the mother addresses different aspects of the child (language, emotional, social, behavioral and motor skills), narrates about the child’s relationships with varied people and describes his behavior in different contexts (at home, on the way to the zoo, at their friends’ house), describes the child’s strengths (lines 4, 15–17) as well as weaknesses (lines 2, 9–12) and provides vivid examples from everyday life to support her descriptions (lines 3–4, 6, 10–14, 16–17).\nAssign a high score Coherence, in light of the above scores in the coherence sub-scales and as the mother provides a clear, consistent and multifaceted portrayal of the child and their relationship that is not unduly colored by the child’s ASD and behavior problems.\nCoding example 3: A section of a transcribed FMSS of a mother of a 16 year-old-girl.\n\t1 “She is my first child, so every step in her development was new to me and maybe because of\n\t2 that, everything is so dramatic with her, or maybe I’m just overreacting. For example, the\n\t3 terrible-twos was terrible (laughs) she resisted all the time and had tantrum attacks but only\n\t4 in retrospect I realized that I reacted in a wrong way, and every time it’s the same story, only\n\t5 in retrospect I understand where I was wrong. Now she is in her adolescence\n\t6 years, and it’s difficult for me. She is stubborn, she disobeys me, and this annoys me.\n\t7 Her room is always a mess. When I go to work, I miss her but when I come home, we just\n\t8 don’t get along. She thinks only of how to go out and have fun with her friends.",
    "9 She does not study hard enough. I know she can do better but she does not care.\n\t10 The message I get from her is \"you’re old and don’t understand anything\".\n\t11 It really gets me angry.”\n\t\nAssign a high score in Focus, as the mother talks only about the child (no “-” signs).\nFor Elaboration, denote a “+” next to the description of the child’s behavior at age 2 (line 3) and the examples of the difficulties the mother is currently experiencing with her daughter (lines 6–10). Accordingly, assign a high score in Elaboration.\nAssign a high score in Separateness, as the mother describes her daughter as having a distinct personality (no “-” signs).\nFor Concern, denote a “+” next to the description of the concern the mother experiences regarding her parenting (lines 2–5). In light of these remarks, assign a high score in Concern.\nReverse the score in Concern from high to low.\nFor Acceptance, denote a “-” next to the mother’s expressions of rejection of her daughter when stating that everything is dramatic with the child (line 2) and listing the daughter’s behaviors that annoy and make the mother angry (lines 6–11). Accordingly, assign a low score in Acceptance.\nAssign a low score in Complexity as the narrative is one-sided negative and relates solely to aspects that concern (lines 2–5) or upset (lines 2, 6–11) the mother.\nAssign a low score in Coherence, as although the narrative is consistent, it is one-sided negative, and colored by the mother’s concern and negative view of her child.\nEstablishing reliability\nBefore coding FMSS transcripts from the study, establish inter-rater reliability with the FMSS-Coherence authors.\nCode and have another trained coder code at least 20% of the narratives of the sample to establish inter-coder reliability30.",
    "NOTE: With small samples, it is recommended that a higher percentage of the FMSS would be coded by the two coders30.\nOnly after establishing reliability, discuss discrepancies in the scores and resolve them through consensus.\nCalculate interrater reliability using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for the continuous coherence scores and Kappa for the dichotomized coherence scores30."
