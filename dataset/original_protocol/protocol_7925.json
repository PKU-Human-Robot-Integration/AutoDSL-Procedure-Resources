    "1. Preparation of Buffers, Stock Solutions, and Gradients\nPrepare the following stock solutions that can be stored up to 6 months at 4 °C.\n\t\nPrepare 1 L of Tricine buffer (1 M, pH 8.4) and Tricine buffer (1 M, pH 7.6). Adjust pH by adding KOH pellets.\nPrepare 1 L of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 0.5 M, pH 8) and 3-(N-morpholino) propane sulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer (1 M, pH 7.8). Adjust pH by adding NaOH pellets.\nPrepare 50 mL of MgCl2 (1 M).\nPrepare 50 mL of protease inhibitors solutions: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF set up in isopropanol, 100 mM), benzamidine hydrochloride hydrate (100 mM), and ε-amino caproic acid (50 mM).\n\t\tNOTE: While PMSF and amino caproic acid are stable in solution for months at 4 °C, benzamidine solution should be stored at -20 °C.\nPrepare the following solutions the day before the experiment and store all solutions at 4 °C.\n\t\nPrepare 4 L of grinding medium pH 8.4 containing Tricine-KOH (20 mM, pH 8.4), sorbitol (0.4 M), EDTA (10 mM, pH 8), and NaHCO3 (10 mM). Adjust pH by adding NaOH pellets. Add bovine serum albumin (BSA) at 0.1% (w/v) just before use and mix well.\nPrepare 500 mL of washing medium (2 x) pH 7.6 containing Tricine-KOH (20 mM, pH 7.6), sorbitol (0.8 M), MgCl2 (5 mM), and EDTA (2.5 mM). Adjust pH by adding NaOH pellets. Dilute such solution after preparation of Percoll gradient solution to obtain washing medium (1 x).\nPrepare 200 mL of Percoll gradient solution for chloroplast purification by mixing Percoll with washing medium (2 x) at an equal volume to get a final solution at 50% (v/v) Percoll / 0.4 M sorbitol.",
    "Prepare 50 mL of sucrose solutions for chloroplast fractionation by mixing MOPS (10 mM, pH 7.8), MgCl2 (4 mM), and different concentrations of sucrose (0.3 M, 0.6 M, and 0.93 M).\nPrepare the following gradients and buffers prior to starting the experiment.\n\t\nPrepare six tubes of Percoll gradients (each containing 30 mL of a 50% Percoll / 0.4 M sorbitol) by centrifugation at 38,700 x g for 55 min at 4 °C. Keep the brake off to prevent blending of the gradients. After centrifugation, store the tubes containing the preformed gradients in a cold room until use.\nPrepare four tubes of sucrose gradients, with each gradient formed of three following sucrose layers: 3 mL of 0.93 M, 2.5 mL of 0.6 M, and 2 mL of 0.3 M sucrose. Carefully overlay each layer, using a peristaltic pump starting with 0.93 M at the bottom and finishing with 0.3 M at the top.\nPrepare 50 mL of hypotonic medium for chloroplast lysis containing MOPS (10 mM, pH 7.8), MgCl2 (4 mM), PMSF (1 mM, set up in isopropanol), benzamidine hydrochloride hydrate (1 mM), and ε-amino caproic acid (0.5 mM). Store the buffer on ice until use.\nPrepare 50 mL of membrane washing buffer containing MOPS (10 mM, pH 7.8), PMSF (1 mM), benzamidine hydrochloride hydrate (1 mM), and ε-amino caproic acid (0.5 mM). Store the buffer on ice until use.\n2. Growth and Harvesting of Arabidopsis Leaves\nFor growth of Arabidopsis plants, prepare 4 large plastic pans (for a total surface of 0.5 to 1 m2) of Arabidopsis plants by sowing 30 mg of seeds in each pan. Grow Arabidopsis plants for 5 weeks at 12-h light cycle at 23 °C (day) / 18 °C (night) with a light intensity of 150 μM m-2 s-1.",
    "Incubate plants in a dark and cold room (4 °C) overnight prior to the experiment (to reduce the amount of starch granules in chloroplasts).\nPre-weigh a 1 L beaker and then place it on ice before starting harvesting of leaf material.\nHarvest Arabidopsis leaves by avoiding soil (compost). Re-weigh the beaker and record the tissue weight.\n\tNOTE: 400 to 500 g of leaf material are expected from four pans.\nHomogenize leaves in a cold room with 2 L of grinding buffer (add BSA before use) three times/2 s each time, in a blender at high speed.\nFilter the homogenate in a cold room using 4 layers of muslin and one layer of nylon blutex. Gently squeeze the homogenate leaves inside the muslin/nylon blutex to extract all the liquid.\nRecover the remaining tissue in the blender cup for a second extraction. Repeat steps 2.5 and 2.6 using 2 L of grinding medium and new 4-5 layers of muslin (in a cold room).\n3. Purification of Crude Chloroplasts Using Differential Centrifugation\nEqually distribute the crude cell extract into six 500 mL bottles and place the bottles on ice before centrifugation. Centrifuge for 2 min as soon as the maximum speed (2,070 x g) is reached (maximum acceleration and brake on, 4 °C).\nGently discard the supernatant.\nAspirate the remaining supernatant using a water pump and keep the pellets containing concentrated crude chloroplasts on ice.\nGently resuspend pellets by adding a minimal volume of washing medium (1 x) (final volume of the combined chloroplast suspensions = 36 mL) using a paintbrush or a curved plastic spatula. Use a 10 mL pipet to add 3 mL of washing medium in each bottle.",
    "NOTE: Do not use pipet with very fine tips to avoid breakage of chloroplasts. Alternatively, cut the blue tip of a pipet with a razor blade to generate a larger hole.\nCollect the resuspended chloroplasts in one tube by using a 10 mL pipet. Gently mix by inverting the tube to obtain a homogenous suspension prior to loading on Percoll gradients.\n4. Purification of Intact Chloroplasts on Continuous Percoll Gradient\nSlowly load 6 mL of the chloroplast suspension on top of each of the six Percoll gradients using a 10 mL pipet to avoid breakage of chloroplasts.\nCentrifuge the gradients for 10 min at 13,300 x g, 4 °C using a swinging-bucket rotor.\n\tNOTE: The acceleration should be slow, and the brake should be disconnected (brake off or slow deceleration) to prevent blending of the Percoll gradients.\nAspirate the upper phase that contains broken chloroplasts and intact mitochondria using a water pump, and then retrieve intact chloroplasts present in the lower phase (the broad dark-green band) with a 10 mL pipet. Be careful not to aspirate nuclei and cell debris (found at the bottom of the tube) with the intact chloroplasts (Figure 2A).\nDilute 3-4-fold the intact chloroplast suspension with washing buffer (1 x). Centrifuge for 2 min as soon as the maximum speed (2,070 x g, 4 °C) is reached (maximum acceleration and brake on).\nCarefully discard the supernatant.\nCompletely aspirate the remaining supernatant with a water pump and keep the pellet of concentrated intact chloroplasts on ice.",
    "Before chloroplast lysis, keep an aliquot of intact chloroplast fraction in approximately 1 mL of washing medium (1 x) for further analyses using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and western blotting. Keep a small aliquot of these intact chloroplasts for determination of protein concentration. Store the intact chloroplast fraction in liquid nitrogen for further experiments.\n5. Lysis of Intact Chloroplasts Using a Hypotonic Buffer and Purification of Chloroplast Sub-Compartments on Discontinuous Sucrose Gradients\nLyse the purified intact chloroplasts by resuspending the pellet in hypotonic medium that contains protease inhibitors (the final volume should not exceed 12 mL).\n\tNOTE: From this step, the use of pipet with fine tips (blue tips) is possible since intactness of chloroplasts is no more essential (pipetting chloroplasts up and down as long as pellet is not entirely resuspended). Arabidopsis chloroplasts are very fragile (when compared to pea chloroplasts, for example) and their lysis is almost immediate after incubation in hypotonic medium.\nSlowly load 3 mL of the lysed chloroplasts on the top of each preformed sucrose gradients using a peristaltic pump.\nUltracentrifuge the gradients for 1 h at (70,000 x g, 4 °C). Balance pairs of tubes using hypotonic medium buffer prior to centrifugation.\nCarefully recover the soluble stromal proteins by pipetting the upper phase of the gradient (3 mL from each gradient) (Figure 2B). Take an aliquot for determination of protein concentration7. Store the stroma in liquid nitrogen for further experiments.\nAspirate the remaining upper phase of each gradient up to the yellow band using a water pump.\nRetrieve the yellow band (the envelope) with a pipet (approximately 1 mL from each gradient). Pool the envelopes in one tube.\nRemove the remaining phase of each gradient up to the thylakoid pellet using a water pump.",
    "6. Washing and Concentration of Thylakoid and Envelope Membrane Systems\nResuspend the thylakoid pellets (green pellets) in a minimum volume (2 mL) of membrane washing buffer (1 x) (with protease inhibitors).\nDilute the envelope and thylakoid suspensions 3-4-fold in membrane washing medium (adjust volume to 10 mL) and ultracentrifuge for 1 h at (110,000 x g, 4 °C). Balance pairs of tubes using membrane washing buffer prior to centrifugation.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatants using a water pump.\nAdd approximately 100 µL of membrane washing buffer (with protease inhibitors) to the envelope pellet. Take an aliquot for determination of protein concentration7. Store the purified envelope membrane preparation in liquid nitrogen.\nResuspend thylakoids pellet in 3 mL of membrane washing buffer (with protease inhibitors). Take an aliquot for determination of protein concentration7. Store thylakoid membrane fraction in liquid nitrogen."
