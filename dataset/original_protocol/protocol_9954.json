    "The authors acknowledge the healthy volunteers who kindly donated their blood. Blood specimens were obtained after informed volunteer consent according to institutional review board (IRB) protocol #2018H0268 reviewed by the Biomedical Sciences Committee at The Ohio State University.\n1. Microfabrication of bioparticle microarray\nUsing standard photolithography procedures, generate the master silicon wafer.\n\t\nGenerate a proof of the desired design using a computer-aided design (CAD) software, then send to a photomask manufacturer to produce a chrome photomask. The design used here is 4 mm x 4 mm rectangular arrays of 30 µm diameter filled in circles with a 150 µm center-to-center spacing. This design can be modified as desired for different applications.\nSpincoat a 40 µm thick layer of a negative photoresist onto a silicon wafer. Bake wafer at 65 °C for 5 min and 95 °C for 10 min.\nExpose wafer to UV light through a chrome photomask with 150–160 mJ/cm2 (Figure 1A).\nBake wafer at 65 °C for 5 min and 95 °C for 10 min. Submerge wafer in photoresist developer for 10 min and rinse with isopropyl alcohol. At this stage, the pattern should be visible on the wafer (Figure 1B).\nThoroughly mix a 10:1 ratio of polydimethylsiloxane prepolymer and its curing agent (i.e., 20 g of prepolymer and 2 g of curing agent) and pour the uncured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mixture over the master wafer in a Petri dish (Figure 1C).\nVacuum treat the uncured PDMS mixture until no air bubbles are present over the master wafer. Cure at 65 °C overnight.\nUse a scalpel to cut around the exterior of the patterned section of the wafer, and slowly remove the cured PDMS slab. Place the PDMS slab on a clean cutting board with the patterned side facing up (Figure 1D).",
    "Punch out individual stamps from the PDMS slab with an 8 mm biopsy punch (Figure 1E). For one glass slide, eight stamps will be needed.\nPlace each stamp face down on the adhesive tape to remove any debris.\nIn advance, prepare a 1.6 mg/mL solution of CP in water.\n\t\nAdd the proper amount of the CP powder to water (e.g., 0.8 g to 500 mL).\nMix on a stir plate at room temperature overnight, or until all the solid is dissolved into the water. The CP solution can be stored at room temperature for 6 months.\nIf desired, make the CP solution fluorescent by adding poly-L-lysine labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (PLL-FITC).\n\t\t\nAliquot about 10 mL of the CP solution. Add a small amount of PLL-FITC (0.05 mg) to the aliquoted volume. The amount can be altered to adjust the brightness of fluorescence as desired.\nVortex the CP solution labeled with FITC for 20 s, or until the solution is a uniform, pale yellow color. Protect from light and store at 4 °C for up to 1 month.\nWith the stamps face-up, prime each stamp with 100 µL of 1.6 mg/mL solution of CP, ensuring no air bubbles form between the CP solution and the stamp (Figure 1F).\nInvert the stamps onto a layer of CP solution (Figure 1G).\nRemove the stamps from the CP solution after 1 h.\nDab each wet stamp face down onto a clean glass slide 6–8x to remove excess liquid.\nVacuum treat the stamps for 1–2 min.\nAdhere an eight well, 9 mm diameter imaging spacer on the top of a clean glass slide as a guide for stamp placement. With this spacer, each glass slide can have eight microarrays.",
    "Place a stamp face down on the glass slide in the center of each well of the imaging spacer (i.e., use eight stamps total).\nPlace a 5.6 ± 0.1 g balanced weight on top of each stamp and allow 10 min for stamping (Figure 1H). A balanced weight is required to ensure the stamp is pressed evenly onto the glass slide and promote even transfer of the CP to the glass slide.\nRemove the weights and stamps from the glass slide (Figure 1I). Allow the CP layer to dry at room temperature for 24 h before adding the bioparticles, as described in step 1.17. If the CP is tagged with FITC, the effectiveness of the stamping can be checked at this point with a fluorescent microscope at 488 nm before proceeding to step 1.17 (Figure 1M).\nCut a blank PDMS slab to the size of the imaging spacer and use the 8 mm biopsy punch to create wells in the PDMS that align with the wells of an imaging spacer. Adhere the PDMS slab to the glass slide with the imaging spacer (Figure 1J).\nThaw a solution of bioparticles (e.g., E. coli or zymosan) and dilute to 500 μg/mL in water for injection (WFI).\n\tNOTE: The bioparticles do not need to be opsonized. Neutrophil surface receptors directly recognize molecules on these bioparticles19,20,21.\nAdd 100 μL of bioparticle solution to each PDMS well on the glass slide (Figure 1K).\nRock the glass slide for 30 min.\nRinse the wells thoroughly with water. The bioparticle microarray can be stored in a dust-free environment at 4 °C for up to 3 months. At this point, the pattern should be checked with a fluorescent microscope at 594 nm before proceeding to step 2.1 (Figure 1N).\n2. Sample Preparation",
    "Collect at least 2 mL of fresh blood in K2-EDTA tubes from the desired donor. The expected yield of neutrophils is 1–2 x 106 cells/1 mL whole blood. The imaging assay requires approximately 1.5 x 105 neutrophils, and the analysis of the supernatant requires 1 x 106 neutrophils. Use the blood within 4 h.\nSeparate red blood cells (RBCs) by adding an erythrocyte aggregation agent in a 1:5 ratio to the whole blood. Wait 45 min for a translucent layer (buffy coat) to separate from the layer of RBCs.\nRemove the buffy coat and wash with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) using 1 mL buffy coat: 9 mL PBS.\nCentrifuge for 5 min at 190 x g and 20 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet at 5 x 107 cells/mL.\nUse a negative immunomagnetic selection kit to isolate neutrophils.\n\t\nAdd 50 μL of antibody cocktail/1 mL cell suspension. Wait 10 min.\nAdd 100 μL of magnetic beads/1 mL cell suspension. Wait 10 min.\nAdd cell suspension to a round-bottom tube and place in a cylindrical magnet. Wait 10 min.\nPour supernatant into a centrifuge tube. Add up to 10 mL of PBS. Centrifuge for 5 min at 190 x g and 20 °C.\nAspirate supernatant. Resuspend white pellet in IMDM with 0.4% human serum albumin.\nStain nuclei with 20 µg/mL Hoechst 33342 for 10 min at 37 °C.\nAdd 5 mL of IMDM with 0.4% human serum albumin to rinse. Centrifuge for 5 min at 190 x g and 20 °C.\nResuspend cells at 7.5 x 105 cells/mL in IMDM with 0.4% human serum albumin.\nAdd 100 µL of the cell suspension to a PDMS well containing a bioparticle microarray. Ensure the cell suspension is convex over the top of the PDMS well and does not contain any bubbles.",
    "Seal with a 12 mm diameter coverslip. Cover the opening of the PDMS well with a 12 mm diameter coverslip. Press down gently onto the coverslip with tweezers so the excess cell suspension escapes to the edge of the well. Use a tissue to remove the excess cell suspension.\n3. Running the assay and image analysis\nLoad microparticle array with cells on the live cell imaging station with a microscope equipped with a cage incubator set to 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 90% relative humidity.\nUse time-lapse fluorescent and brightfield microscopy to record images at 10x magnification every 10 s at 405 nm, 594 nm, and brightfield. In a typical experiment, images are collected up to 2 h.\nUse an automated cell tracking software to track the migration of individual neutrophils toward the bioparticle cluster.\n\t\nUse the autoregression mode of a spot detection cell tracking software. Set the spot radius to 5 µm (the approximate size of a neutrophil nucleus). Set the minimum track length to 120 s and a maximum gap size of one frame.\nFrom the data generated by the cell tracking software, extract the files that contain the neutrophil position and speed. These files can be used with a graphing software to generate neutrophil migration tracks (Figure 2C) and a heat map of speed vs. time (Figure 2D), respectively.\nUse the 405 nm fluorescent images to track swarm size over time on an image analysis software of your choice.\n\t\nDefine regions of interest (ROIs) around each bioparticle cluster where neutrophils will swarm. Keep the same size ROI to analyze each bioparticle cluster.\nAnalyze the mean fluorescent intensity of the 405 nm images within each ROI over time.",
    "Generate a calibration curve of mean fluorescent intensity to swarm size by taking manual measurements at various swarm sizes from 0 µm2 to the maximum swarm size. Use this calibration to calculate the swarm size over time.\n4. Supernatant collection and protein detection\nIncubate the neutrophils in the wells containing the bioparticle microarray at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 3 h. Take samples at desired time points. Typically, samples will be taken at 0, 0.5, 1, and 3 h. To overcome the limit of detection of the protein array assay, the entire volume of supernatant of a single well (200 µL) was used for each time point. Each time point was analyzed in triplicate.\nUsing a brightfield microscope, verify that swarms are formed on the microarray.\nAspirate the supernatant with a 200 µL pipette and load in a 0.45 μm centrifuge filter tube.\nCentrifuge the supernatant at 190 x g and 20 °C for 5 min and collect the filtrated volume.\nStore samples at -80 °C until the processing time.\nUse a microarray kit that detects a range of human proteins to process samples.\n\t\nAdd 200 μL of each sample to a separate dialysis tube provided with the kit.\nPlace the dialysis tubes in a beaker containing at least 500 mL of PBS (pH = 8.0). Stir gently on a stir plate for at least 3 h at 4 °C. Change the PBS in the beaker and repeat this step.\nTransfer each sample to a clean centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 9,000 x g for 5 min to remove any precipitates. Transfer each supernatant to a clean tube.",
    "Biotinylate each sample by adding 36 µL of 1x labeling reagent from the kit per 1 mg of total protein in the dialyzed sample to 180 µL of dialyzed sample. Incubate at 20 °C for 30 min. Mix gently every 5 min.\nAdd 3 µL of stop solution provided with the kit into each sample tube. Transfer each sample to a fresh dialysis tube and repeat steps 4.6.2–4.6.3. At this stage, the sample can be stored at -20 °C or -80 °C until you are ready to proceed.\nThe glass slide provided with the kit is stored at -20 °C. Allow it to come to room temperature. Place the assembled glass slide in a laminar flow hood for 1–2 h at room temperature.\nAdd 400 μL of the blocking buffer provided with the kit into each well of the assembled glass slide. Incubate at room temperature for 30 min.\nCentrifuge the prepared samples for 5 min at 9,000 x g to remove precipitates or particulates. Dilute 5x with blocking buffer.\nRemove the blocking buffer from each well. Add 400 μL of the diluted samples into the appropriate wells. Incubate for 2 h at room temperature while rocking.\nDecant the samples from each well. Wash 3x with 800 μL of the 1x wash buffer I provided with the kit at room temperature for 5 min each while rocking.\nIn a clean container, submerge the assembled glass slide in 1x wash buffer I. Wash 2x at room temperature for 5 min each while rocking.\nAdd 400 μL of 1x Cy3-conjugated streptavidin to each sub-array. Cover with plastic adhesive strips. Protect from light for the remainder of the protocol.\nIncubate for 2 h at room temperature while rocking.\nDecant the solution and disassemble the glass slide from the sample chambers.",
    "In the 30 mL centrifuge tube provided with the kit, carefully add the glass slide and enough 1x wash buffer I to cover the glass slide. Wash 3x for 10 min each at room temperature while rocking.\nIn the 30 mL centrifuge tube, wash 2x with 1x wash buffer II for 5 min each at room temperature while rocking.\nWash the glass slide with 30 mL of ddH2O for 5 min. Remove the glass slide from the centrifuge tube and allow to dry for 20 min in a laminar flow hood. The prepared glass slide may be stored at -20 °C until ready to scan.\nScan the glass slide with a microarray scanner at a fluorescence emission of 555 nm.\nSubscription Required.
