  "procedures": [
    "All animal experimental procedures complied with the relevant ethical Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publication no. 85-23, revised 2011) and were approved by the committees on animal research of Huadong Hospital affiliated to Fudan University. Fourteen-week-old male C57BL/6 mice (28-30g) were randomly divided into four groups: Sham group, Sham+Ang II group, RDN group, RDN+Ang II group, n = 6 in each group. All animals were maintained under specific closed pathogen-free conditions in a temperature-controlled room at 24 ± 1 °C with a 12h light/dark cycle and free access to standard rodent chow and water ad libitum.\n1. Preparation of the operation field\nDisinfect the operation table with 70% ethanol. Adjust the heating pad temperature to 37 °C.\nEnsure that all surgical instruments are sterilized before surgery at 121 °C for 30 min or by other methods. This procedure requires micro surgical scissors, two fine straight forceps, two fine curved forceps, hemostatic forceps, sterile gauzes, and weighing papers.\n2. Angiotensin II induced hypertension\nProvide meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg, SC) to the C57BL/6 mice shortly before anesthesia induction. Then, anesthetize the mice using sodium pentobarbital injection as previously described20,21. Isoflurane can also be used, if preferred. Confirm anesthesia depth with a negative toe pinch reflex.\nRemove the hair on the back with a shaver. Apply vet ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nPlace the animal on an operating table in the dorsal position. Swab and wipe the shaved area with povidone-iodine followed by three wipes with 70% ethanol.\nMake a 1 cm incision using a sterile scalpel blade, perpendicular to the tail, behind the ear over the shoulder blade of the front leg.",
    "Use a sterile hemostat to make a subcutaneous tunnel under the skin and create a pocket for the pump22. Insert an osmotic pump filled with Angiotensin II (1,000 ng/kg/min) into the pocket gently. Ensure that there is enough free space to suture the wound without stretching the skin.\nSuture the muscle with interrupted 6-0 Vicryl sutures and close the skin with interrupted 4-0 nylon sutures. Swab and wipe the wound site with povidone-iodine. Perform the same surgery with equal volume of saline for the control group.\nPlace all the surgical instruments into a sterilizer for 10 s and replace the sterile gloves between surgeries. Monitor all mice until fully recovered.\nClosely monitor and observe wound healing in mice at least twice a day during the first week and once every day subsequently, including redness, swelling, and infection. Perform dissection immediately if the mice die during Ang II infusion.\nMeasure blood pressure at baseline and every week after Ang II infusion with the tail-cuff plethysmography method23 in conscious mice. Ensure that the blood pressure measurement experiments are conducted in a quiet area, at 22 ± 2 °C, where mice are acclimatized for 1 h before the experiment begins. Habituate mice for at least 5 consecutive days before baseline blood pressure measurements23,24.\n3. Bilateral renal denervation\nSelect the mice with elevated blood pressure (BP) ≥140/90mmHg or 25% increase in systolic BP/diastolic BP, 1 week after the Ang II infusion.\nRecord animal weight before surgery and choose animals with a minimum weight of 24 g for renal denervation surgery.\nAnesthetize the mice using sodium pentobarbital. Confirm anesthesia depth with a negative toe pinch reflex.\nRemove the hair on the abdomen with a shaver. Perform this procedure carefully and thoroughly to avoid any surgical contamination.",
    "Place the mice on the operating table, keeping the abdomen up and fix its limbs with tape. Disinfect abdominal skin with povidone-iodine followed by three wipes with 70% ethanol.\nMake a 2 cm ventral midline abdominal incision using a scalpel blade. Pull back the intestine with gauze soaked in 37 °C saline to expose the left renal artery. Carefully yet bluntly dissect the fat away from the renal artery using curved tweezers. (Figure 1A-C).\nCut the weighing paper into a rectangle of the same size as the renal artery with sterile sharp scissors. For reference, cut the weighing paper in the same size as shown by the dotted line in Figure 1C.\n\tNOTE: It is a critical part of the surgery, try to cut several pieces of the weighing paper at a time to keep the same shape.\nDip the weighing paper in 10% phenol/ethanol solution for at least 30 s. Cover the surface of the left renal artery and wrap the vessel with the weighing paper, keep for 2 min (Figure 1D). Use gauze to protect the surrounding tissues to avoid the weighing paper from touching the surrounding kidney and intestine.\n\t​NOTE: The phenol solution is stable in plastic tubes but not in glass vials. Therefore, the solution must be freshly prepared for every experiment18.\nPerform the same procedure for the right renal artery. Perform the sham surgery with weighing paper immersed in saline.\nReposition muscles into their initial position and close the peritoneum with 6-0 Vicryl sutures in an interrupted suture. Then, close the skin with interrupted 4-0 nylon sutures. Monitor all mice until fully recovered.\n4. Post-operative care\nApply povidone-iodine to the incision and place the animal in a warmed electric blanket for recovery and post-operative monitoring.",
    "Monitor the mice twice a day to assess for redness, swelling, and pain or abdominal infection. Provide meloxicam (0.5 mg/kg, SC) to all mice about 1 h before and 24 h after the RDN procedure.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
