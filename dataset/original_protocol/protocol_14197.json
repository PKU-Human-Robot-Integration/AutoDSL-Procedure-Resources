    "All experimental procedures were conducted according to the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes, set by the National Health and Medical Research Council in Australia. Ethics approval was obtained from the Howard Florey Institute Animal Ethics Committee (approval number 13-044-UM and 13-068-UM for rats and mice, respectively).\n1. Intraocular Pressure Measurement in Conscious Rats\nSet the laboratory rebound tonometer to the rat setting. Swaddle the awake rat in a piece of soft cloth to calm the animal. Expose the head and neck. Gently hold the torso in one hand, with the animal's back resting against the investigator's chest.\n\tNOTE: Topical anesthesia is not required.\nUse the other hand to bring the rebound tonometer near the rat's eye, so that the tip of the IOP probe is approximately 2 - 3 mm away from and perpendicular to the corneal apex. Use the right hand to measure IOP in the animal's right eye, and left hand for the left eye.\nWait a few seconds for the rat to calm and press the measurement button once. Observe the tip of the IOP probe gently hit the corneal apex once; and hear the rebound tonometer beep once.\n\tNOTE: A single beep of the tonometer confirms successful measurement, which can be read from the LCD screen. A double beep indicates a measurement error. Measurement errors can arise from factors such as inappropriate working distance between the probe and the cornea, an excessive tilt in the orientation of the tonometer, or the probe striking the eyelid or a non-central part of the cornea. Refer to the rebound tonometer manual from the manufacturer for further detail regarding measurement errors.",
    "Repeat step 1.3 ten times at an interval of 1 - 2 second, from these measurements derive an average IOP value for that time point. Reset the tonometer after the 5th reading.\nFor serial monitoring, measure IOP at the same time of the day and under consistent lighting conditions to minimize variation due to the diurnal IOP cycle20,21.\n2. Intraocular Pressure Measurement in Conscious Mice\nSet the rebound tonometer to the mouse setting according to manufacturer's instruction.\nTo restrain the mouse by hand, place the mouse on a grill cage top and gently pull the tail backwards.\n\tâ€‹NOTE: This will prompt the animal to grip onto the metal grill with its front legs and attempt to pull itself forward, which will slightly stretch its body.\n\t\nUse the other hand to grasp the loose skin immediately behind the ears. Secure the lower body of the animal by holding the tail between the ring finger and middle finger (or between the little finger and your palm).\n\t\tNOTE: Try not to grasp the skin too tight, to avoid suffocation and applying pressure on the eyes.\nWith the now free hand (initially holding the tail), bring the rebound tonometer near the mouse's eye, so that the tip of the IOP probe is approximately 2 - 3 mm from and perpendicular to the corneal apex. To measure the other eye, rotate the mouse so that the other eye is now in front of the tonometer.\nWait for the mouse to calm and press the measurement button once. Observe the tip of the IOP probe gently hit the corneal apex; with a single beep confirming successful measurement.\n\tNOTE: A double beep indicates a measurement error. It may help to have a second experimenter read and document the IOP readings whilst the first experimenter takes the measurements.",
    "Repeat step 2.4 to obtain ten successful readings to derive an IOP. Reset the tonometer after the 5th reading. Allow an interval of 1 - 2 seconds between readings.\nAs per serial measurement in rats, measure mouse IOP at the same time of the day and under consistent lighting conditions.\n3. Induction of Intraocular Pressure Elevation in Anesthetized Rats and Mice\nClean the surgical bench with 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% ethanol. Cover the bench with sterile drapes. Autoclave all surgical equipment beforehand. Ensure all experimenters wear appropriate personal protective equipment (surgical masks, gowns and sterilized gloves).\nTo induce general anesthesia, place the animal in an induction chamber. Deliver 3 - 3.5% isoflurane with O2 at a flow rate of 3 L/min.\n\t\nMaintain anesthesia with 1.5% isoflurane at 2 L/min delivered via a rodent face mask throughout the surgery. Ensure sufficient depth of anesthesia by the absence of a paw pinch reflex.\nAvoid respiratory depression by adjusting the flow rate when necessary to maintain the respiratory rate at approximately 60 breaths/min.\nRandomly select one eye to induce ocular hypertension, with the contralateral eye to serve as an untreated control. Instill one drop of 0.5% proxymetacaine ophthalmic solution for topical anesthesia. To clean the ocular surface, rinse the eye with 3 mL of sterile normal saline.\nCover the animal with a sterile, fenestrated surgical drape, exposing the eye to be sutured.\nPerform a purse-string suture on the bulbar conjunctiva around the globe. In rats, weave the 7/0 nylon suture parallel and 2 mm posterior to the limbus (Figure 1). In mice, place the 10/0 nylon suture at 1 mm posterior to the limbus.\n\t\nTake care not to penetrate the sclera. A sudden pupillary dilation during the surgical procedure indicates the sclera has likely been penetrated.",
    "Anchor the suture on the conjunctiva using 5-6 anchor points in rats, and 4-5 anchor points in mice.\nAvoid direct compression on the major episcleral veins by threading the suture underneath the conjunctiva at the crossing of these veins.\n\t\tNOTE: While we recommend avoiding compression of the major episcleral vein in rats, this is not routinely done in mice due to low visibility of these veins in mouse eyes. Even though the major veins are not directly compressed, it is likely that the smaller vessels in the episcleral vein plexus are under pressure, which may be a contributing factor to the sustained IOP elevation (please see Discussion for mechanism of IOP elevation).\nFasten the purse-string suture by tying a slipknot then followed by a second simple knot (Figure 1). To avoid an excessively high post-surgical IOP spike, have an assistant measure the IOP immediately before fastening the second knot.\n\t\nIf the IOP is found to be too high, adjust the slip knot by partially releasing the tension on one end of the suture (arrow in Figure 1A).\nAfter the desired IOP is achieved (ideally 30 - 60 mmHg in rats or 30 - 40 mmHg in mice), tie off the second knot while maintaining a continuous pulling force on that end of the suture (arrow in Figure 1A).\nAfter the second knot has been tightened, trim the ends of the suture to minimize any foreign body sensation. Monitor the animal during recover from general anesthesia.\n\t\tNOTE: It is important to use the slipknot when tying the first knot to ensure adequate inward compression on the eye. After several weeks it is usually noted that the ends become embedded in the conjunctiva.\n4. Monitoring IOP",
    "Take the first IOP measurement at 2 minutes post-operatively under isoflurane anesthesia. Subsequently, monitor IOP when the rodent has regained consciousness as per the aforementioned steps 1 and 2.\n\tNOTE: Monitor the IOP twice during the first day (2 minutes and 1 hour), daily in the first week and once or twice per week thereafter.\n5. Assaying Retinal Structure and Function\nAt the desired experimental end point (in this case after 8 weeks in rats and 12 weeks in mice), under general anesthesia using intraperitoneal injection with ketamine/xylazine, measure retinal function with the dark-adapted electroretinogram (ERG) as described in greater detail elsewhere15,16,17.\n\tNOTE: We have found robust ganglion cell dysfunction, retinal nerve fibre layer thinning and ganglion cell loss for durations between 8-12 weeks. Others have successfully employed longer periods of IOP elevation14,15.\nImmediately after ERG measurement, measure the thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and total retinal thickness using spectral domain optic coherence tomography (SD-OCT) 16,18.\nAt the end of the longitudinal study, euthanize the animals under deep anesthesia.\n\t\nDissect the retina for histology18, for example immunostaining of whole-mount retina using a retinal ganglion cell (RGC) specific antibody such as RNA-binding protein with multiple splicing antibody (RBPMS) or brain-specific homeobox/POU domain protein 3A (Brn3a)16,19,22.\nSubscription Required.
