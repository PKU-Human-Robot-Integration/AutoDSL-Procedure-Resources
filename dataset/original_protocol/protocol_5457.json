    "Preparation of plant extracts    Sweet green pepper (Capsicum annuum) fruits were provided by Syngenta Seeds S.A. (El Ejido, Spain) from plants grown in experimental greenhouses with optimal nutrients supplementation applied on rockwood as substrate.    Surface-sterilize Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia seeds for 5 min in 70% ethanol containing 0.1% SDS. Then, place in sterile water containing 20% (v/v) commercial Bleach and 0.1% SDS for 20 min. Wash four times with sterile water. Grow seeds on Petri plates over commercial Murashige and Skoog medium (Sigma-Aldrich) at a pH of 5.5, containing 1% (w/v) sucrose and 0.8% (w/v) phyto-agar. Place the seedlings for 14 days at 16 h light, 22 °C/8 h dark, 18 °C, under a light intensity of 100 μE m-2 sec-1.    Homogenize plant samples (between 0.1 to 0.5 g) in a mortar and pestle with Gridding buffer (see Recipes) in a ratio 1:1 (w/v) for pepper fruits and ratio 1:3 (w/v) for Arabidopsis. Perform these operations at 0-4 °C, for example using a container with ice (see Figure 1).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170914/20170914201847_6025.jpg Figure 1. Illustrative picture showing the Disposition of the mortar in the container with ice    Centrifuge extracts at 27,000 x g at 4 °C for 20 min.   Use the supernatants for the protein assays. Determine protein concentration with the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Dye Reagent (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) using bovine serum albumin as the standard according with the ‘Microassay Procedure’ as outlined by the manufacturer.     SDS-PAGE and S-nitrosothiols staining   Pre-run SDS-PAGE using a precast 4-20% gradient TGX Mini-Protean gel (without samples) for 30 min at 30 mA per gel with standard running buffer containing 1 mM EDTA. Note: The gel is pre-run primarily to remove any potential traces of unpolymerized acrylamide.   Prepare samples with sample treatment buffer (see Recipes) in ratio 1:1 (v/v).",
    "For each samples, 25 µg of protein is loaded per lane.   Run the electrophoresis at 15 mA per gel. The electrophoresis should be stopped when the front line indicated by the bromophenol blue (used for tracing the migration of samples) is 1 cm from the end of the gel (usually for 45 to 60 min).   Wash the gel with 20-25 ml ultrapure water containing 1 mM EDTA for 5 min.   Coat the gel with Gel staining solution (28 µM DAF-FM) for 10 min at room temperature in the dark. Note: Cover with a piece of Parafilm of the same size and use a roller to gently smooth the staining solution over the gel such that there is a homogenous distribution of the solution.   Expose the gel to UV light for 5 min.   Take a picture with the fluor imager (PharosFMTM) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength of 530 nm) (see Figure 2).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170914/20170914202029_7142.jpg Figure 2.
