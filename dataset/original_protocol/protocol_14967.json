    "Protocols have been approved by the \"comité d'éthique en matière d'expérimentation animale de Strasbourg\" (CREMEAS).\n1. Baseline Measurement of Paw Withdrawal Thresholds\nAllow the mice to habituate to the animal facilities for at least 10 days to 2 weeks before initiating the testing procedures.\nHabituate the mice to the von Frey testing set-up and to the von Frey procedure that are described in section 4.\nBefore surgery, evaluate the mechanical paw withdrawal thresholds with von Frey filaments as described in the section 4.3. Note: Repeat the procedure on separate days until at least three stable consecutive values are obtained for paw withdrawal thresholds.\nAssign the mice to the different experimental groups so that these groups do not initially differ for paw withdrawal thresholds.\n2. Surgery Procedure for Cuff Implantation\nWeigh the animal. Note: Mouse body weight should be over 20 g for the cuff insertion procedure described below.\nAnesthetize the animal with an intraperitoneal injection of 4 ml/kg of a mixture of ketamine (17 mg/ml) and xylazine (2.5 mg/ml) in 0.9% NaCl, which provides around 45 min of anesthesia.\nCheck the absence of paw reflexes by pinching a hind paw with tweezers and check the absence of eye reflexes to make sure that the animal is fully anesthetized.\nShave the right leg from the knee to the hip using an electrical shaver.\nApply protective eye liquid gel to the eyes with a cotton-tipped swab.\nPlace the animal on its left side and place the right hind limb on a small pillow and maintain the right hind limb to the pillow with adhesive tape.\nDisinfect the surgery field with chlorhexidine and 70% ethanol using gauze pad or cotton-tipped swab.",
    "Find the femur using the forefinger and make an incision of approximately 0.5 cm, parallel to the femur and approximately 1.5 mm anterior to the femur.\nSeparate the muscles close to the femur with two autoclaved sticks. Notes: Never cut the muscle. Normally, the muscle layers separate easily without any bleeding and the sciatic nerve is then visible. In case of bleeding, use a sterile cotton-tipped swab to absorb the blood.\nInsert two autoclaved sticks below the sciatic nerve to expose its main branch, and hydrate the nerve with a sterile physiological solution (0.9% NaCl).\nHold the pre-prepared sterile 2 mm section of split PE-20 polyethylene tubing (cuff), 0.38 mm ID / 1.09 mm OD, with the help of a pointed steel stick and a bulldog clamp.\n\t\nInsert the pointed steel stick into the cuff, which will slightly open it.\nUsing the cuff lateral opening, insert the bulldog at one end of the cuff and parallel to the cuff. Rotate the bulldog (180°) so that it will hold the cuff by the side that is opposite to the lateral opening. Close the bulldog and remove the pointed steel stick. Note: The rotation is done to allow holding-on the cuff in an optimized position for the insertion, the bulldog clamp is also helping to maintain the cuff partly open. The model and the size of the bulldog clamp are critical for this step of the procedure.\nHave a second experimenter hold the two sticks under the nerve and gently separate the sticks to facilitate the access to a section of sciatic nerve that is around 4 mm long.",
    "Insert the 2 mm cuff around the main branch of the sciatic nerve, starting by inserting the part of the cuff that is distal to the bulldog around the part of the nerve that is proximal to the hip.\nClose the cuff gently by exerting pressure on its two distal sides with pliers, without squeezing or changing the form of the tube. Turn the cuff to ensure that it is closed correctly.\nSuture the shaved skin layer with surgical knots.\nPlace the mouse on its left side in a clean home cage. Keep it under the heat lamp until the mouse is awake.\nAdd extra water and place some chow directly in the home cage.\n3. Surgery Procedure for Sham Controls\nApply the same surgery procedure as described above from step 2.1 to step 2.9, then follow with steps 2.15 to 2.17. For sham controls, omit the steps 2.10 to 2.14 that only concern the cuff insertion.\n4. von Frey Testing\nPlace the mice in clear individual boxes (7 cm x 9 cm x 7 cm) with holes, on an elevated perforated plate of smooth stainless steel (1 m x 50 cm, 5 mm circle perforations with 2.5 mm between perforation borders). Note: Up to 12 mice can be concomitantly tested on this set-up. Operated animals can be tested the day after the surgery. However, 3 days of recovery are recommended to diminish the post-surgery hypersensitivity observed in sham controls.\nAllow the animals to habituate for 15 min prior to testing.",
    "Apply the von Frey filaments to the plantar surface of each hind paw in a series of ascending forces. Notes: The von Frey filaments are plastic hairs of calibrated diameters. They are 5 cm long and are fixed on hand-held applicators. The speed of filament application, the degree of bending and the duration of the application can influence the threshold values that are obtained with this test3. With the present procedure in mice, the filaments that are the most often used are the 0.16, 0.4, 0.6, 1, 1.4, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 g.\n\t\nApply the chosen filament to the plantar surface of the left paw until the filament just bends. Repeat the procedure three to five consecutive times, and then do the same to the right paw. Once the filament has been tested on both paws, test the next animal. Notes: Avoid paw lateral borders which can be more sensitive. The expected response is a paw withdrawal, sudden flinching or paw licking. Consider the response as positive if at least three expected responses are observed out of five trials. A given paw is always tested three times, but the fourth and the fifth trials are done only if 1 or 2 response(s) was (were) observed during the first three tests. In C57BL/6J mice, start the pre-surgery tests with the 1.4 g filament. After surgery, start the tests with the 0.4 g filament. If a positive response is observed with the first tested filament, test a filament of lower force (instead of greater) at step 4.3.2.",
    "Apply the same filament to the next animals according to the 4.3.1 procedure. Once all animals are tested, start again on the first animal with the next filament of greater force. Repeat the procedure until all mice give a positive response. Notes: Test each animal until two consecutive filaments give a positive response. Consider the gram value of the lower filament that gave a positive response as the paw withdrawal threshold for this animal."
