    "**Plasmid Super-Coiling Assay**<sup>1,2</sup>\n1.   In our experiments, we mixed 2 pmol of core histones from HeLa cells \\(see &#x201C;Preparation of Core Histones by FPLC&#x201D;) with 4 pmol or 8 pmol of GST or GST-JDP2, respectively, in the assembly buffer \\(tube A).  The instructions that follow refer to a generalized assay. \n  2.   Incubate the reaction mixture at 30 &#xB0;C for 30 min.\n  3.   In parallel, mix 100 ng of plasmid DNA \\(see Note 1) and 5 units of topoisomerase I in topoisomerase I reaction buffer and incubate at 37 &#xB0;C for 30 min \\(tube B).\n  4.   Combine the topoisomerase I-relaxed circular DNA \\(in tube B) and core histones \\(in tube A) that were pre-incubated with, in our experiments, GST or GST-JDP2 in 50 &#x3BC;l of assembly buffer.\n  5.   Incubate the mixture at 37 &#xB0;C for 1 h.\n  6.   Add an equal volume of 2x stop buffer and continue incubation at 37 &#x2B0;C for 30 min.\n  7.   Extract the plasmid DNA with phenol, chloroform and isoamyl alcohol.\n  8.   Precipitate the DNA in cold ethanol.\n  9.   Fractionate the purified DNA by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel \\(see Note 2), and visualize by staining with ethidium bromide \\(Figure 1). \n    \n**Nucleosome Assembly on a Fragment of 5S DNA<sup>3</sup>**\n1.   Prepare 200 ng of a 197-bp-long fragment of 5S DNA by digestion of pB100-Uless/Strider DNA with EcoR I \\(see Note 3).\n  2.   Incubate the DNA in 10 &#x3BC;l of reaction buffer at 37 &#xB0;C for 1 h with or without 200 ng of core histones that have been pre-incubated with increasing concentrations of, for example, either human His-TAF-1&#xF062;&#xF020;or GST-JDP2.  \n  3.   Fractionate samples on a 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in TBS buffer and visualize reaction products by staining with ethidium bromide or SYBR Gold \\(see Note 4).",
    "4.   Excise gel portions that correspond to mononucleosomes.  Allow them to equilibrate at room temperature for 15 min in the standard buffer for SDS-PAGE, prepared with 0.1 % SDS.\n  5.   Transfer proteins to an ImmobilonTM membrane \\(PVPF membrane; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA, USA).\n  6.   Analyze proteins by Western blotting with antibodies against histone H3 \\(Figure 2)."
