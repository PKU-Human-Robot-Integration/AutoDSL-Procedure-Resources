    "The experiment is conducted in two separate sessions. During the first session a functional MRI experiment (e.g. a functional localizer) is carried out in order to define the desired TMS target areas on an individual subject basis. The fMRI results are then fed into a stereotactic navigation system for an accurate TMS targeting. The second session is held following the analysis of the fMRI data, during which EEG is recorded concurrently with TMS. The protocol described here was approved by the ethics committee of the Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center.\nIn the example given in this paper, data were analyzed with MATLAB version 7.7 (R2008b).  The Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM 5) software for MATLAB and MarsBar toolbox for SPM 23 were used for fMRI data processing.\n1. fMRI Session and fMRI Data Analysis\nRun a functional MRI task using an echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence to determine the desired foci of activation to be targeted with TMS. For a better dissociation between adjacent areas, such as the OFA and EBA in the example below, high-resolution scanning is recommended. Voxels of 3 mm3 or smaller, obtained with an MRI head-coil of 8 channels or more, are sufficient for delineating adjacent regions.\nRun a T1-weighted structural scan to obtain neuroanatomical data. Make sure that the face of the participant is entirely included in the field of view of this scan, since external markers on the image (e.g. the tip of the nose) will be later used to coregister the subject's head with its scan.",
    "After data collection, use the MarsBar toolbox for SPM to define the desired brain regions of interest based on contrasts between the experimental conditions. Use the contrasts face>objects to define the Occipital Face Area (OFA), and bodies>objects to define the Extrastirate Body Area (EBA). To further ensure that the two cortical targets are functionally distinct, use \"conjunction\" (in MarsBar) to mask from each ROI any voxels responding to the other experimental condition (exclude face-voxels from the EBA, and body-voxels from the OFA).\nCorregister the structural T1 images with the functional scans, using SPM.\nCopy the files of the structural scan, as well as the relevant functional contrast files, to a portable drive in order to upload to the navigation system.\n2. Preparing a Paradigm for the EEG-TMS Experiment that will allow ERP Extraction\nDescribed in the section below is a method for collecting EEG data during TMS application in a way that allows extraction of reliable and replicable ERPs19. The advantage of this technique is that it easily handles the secondary, long lasting, TMS artifact, and is robust enough even to allow restoration of data at electrodes located right under the TMS coil, where the artifact is of the highest voltage and longest duration.\nOrganization of the paradigm\n\t\nRun the different TMS conditions (the different target brain areas, as well as a no-TMS condition) in separate blocks.\nWithin each block present the participant with all stimulus conditions (e.g. faces, objects, scenes and so forth) randomly in an event-related design.\nFor better quality of ERP and TMS-noise template (below) make sure to have at least 50 trials per condition.",
    "Set the timing of the TMS pulse/pulses to the desired latency after image onset. This is done via writing to a parallel port, from which a cable goes to the TMS stimulator. This function is available in most software for psychological experiments, such as Psychtoolbox (versions 2 or 3) for MATLAB 24 or E-Prime (see Materials Table). Jitter the inter stimulus interval (ISI) to reduce stimulus (and pulse) predictability (e.g. add a random value between 0 to 500 msec at each ISI).\nPrepare an additional blank-screen condition:\n\t\nPrepare trials during which TMS will be applied at the same intensity, but with no stimulus presentation on the screen. These blank-screen TMS trials will be served to calculate a TMS artifact template in the absence of visual stimulation.\nSet the number of repetitions of the blank trials to be identical to the number of repetitions of any one of the experimental conditions within the block.\nFor an accurate representation of the shape of the TMS residual artifact, randomize the blank trials throughout the whole block rather than presenting them all at the beginning or at the end.\n3. Setting up the EEG and the Neuronavigation System, and Conducting the Experiment\nAccurate TMS targeting of individually defined ROIs is possible with the use of a stereotactic navigation system, comprised of an infrared camera, infrared sensors mounted on the participant's head, and a specialized software.",
    "Screen participants based on TMS safety criteria. Exclude from participation subjects with a self or family history of epilepsy, subjects with other neurological conditions or with frequent migraines, and subjects on psychoactive drugs. Although not typically screened for, subjects with suspicion for autonomic disorders such as vasovagal syncopes (mostly manifested as a tendency to faint easily) may also be excluded. Instruct participants to avoid alcoholic drinks starting the prior evening, and caffeinated drinks at least 2 hr before the experiment.  For further instructions and discussion of safety see Rossi et al25, and the Magstim safety review (http://joedevlin.psychol.ucl.ac.uk/tms/docs/magstim_safety.pdf[href=http://joedevlin.psychol.ucl.ac.uk/tms/docs/magstim_safety.pdf]).\nPrepare the neuronavigation system:\n\t\nBefore the session starts, feed the structural scan files into the navigation system's software.\nOverlay the functional MRI results (the contrasts) on the structural images.\nUsing the Neuronavigation software, mark the desired targets on the images, as well as the external anatomical markers that will serve for coregistration: the tip of the nose, the deepest part of the nose bridge often referred to as nasion, and the tragus of each ear.\nMount the EEG cap on the participant's head and connect the electrodes:\n\t\nTry to keep electrode impedance not higher than 5 kΩ.\nTo avoid TMS-related heating of the electrodes, use as little gel as possible. To achieve good impedance with little amount of gel perform a thorough skin preparation. Optionally, ask participants to wash their hair before coming to the experiment.\nMake sure that the electrode wires do not cross each other and are oriented away from the coil's location. Avoid loops in the wires.\nUse a high sampling rate for a better representation of the noise artifact. It is recommended to use 1 kHz or above, as most previous studies using this method have done7,26-28.",
    "Place the reference and ground electrodes as far from the coil as possible. In this example, areas in the occipital cortex were targeted using a nose reference and an Fz ground7. For other examples see3,4,27,29,30. Note that data can be re-referenced offline to a new reference as needed, such as the common average.\n\t\tNote: For a review about optimization of TMS-EEG setup, see Veniero et al31.\nCoregister the subject's head with the scan, as follows:\n\t\nMount the infrared detectors on the participant's head.\nCoregister the head location with the navigation system using the predefined markers (tip of the nose, etc. See Figure 3). It is advised to repeat the coregistration between blocks to ensure accurate coil placement at all stages.\nLocate the target areas:\n\t\nHave the subject seated with the chin resting on a chinrest at the desired distance from the screen.\nMake sure the participants are comfortable at their chair, as they are asked to refrain from movements during the experimental blocks (important for an accurate noise-template measurement).\nChoose a TMS target from the navigation system Figure 3.\nUsing the pointer tool (see Materials Table), let the navigation system guide the user to the optimal coil location and mark it with a small sticker on the electrode cap. It is important to hold the pointer perpendicular to the head. Repeat this stage prior to each block. Note that it is not recommended to use online navigation during the block (navigating the coil itself while holding it) since any coil movement should be avoided for a best measurement of the TMS artifact template. It was found that predefining and marking the TMS location is the optimal way to achieve stable stimulation.",
    "Guide the coil's precise center to the marker, while being held by a holder. Make sure it is tangential to the head.\nSet the TMS intensity to the desired value. Administer one test pulse for the participant's approval.\nRun the experimental block.\nNo-TMS condition: if a specialized sham TMS coil is not available, place the TMS coil next to the subject's head and tilt it in 90°. Run the block as usual, including the blank trials.\n\tThe reader may also refer to the JoVE video paper by Andon and Zatorre32 for further demonstration of the navigation system.\n4. Analyzing the EEG Data and Computing ERP\nRemove the immediate pulse artifact, as follows:\n\t\nIf a clipping device is not available (see above), the first step in the EEG data processing would be to cut out the immediate TMS pulse artifact itself from the data. Note that this step can be skipped if filters are not desired. But if filters are applied, the sharp-edge shape of the artifact will create distortions in the data. A narrow time-window of 10 to 15 msec after pulse onset should suffice, but be sure to verify this by visual inspection of the data.",
    "Connect the two cut ends created after pulse removal. Two main methods for accomplishing this have been suggested in previous reports: 1. simply join together the two ends remaining after pulse removal (see Fuggetta et al.26 and Figure 1); 2. interpolate a line between the two cut ends by generating equally spaced values between them7. The equation used for this interpolation is as follows: for each missing data point y at sample x, compute y=y0+((y1-y0)*(x-x0))/(x1-x0) where x0 and y0 are the coordinates for the last data point before the cut segment, and x1 and y1 are the coordinates for the first data point after the cut segment. Both techniques assure that filters can be applied on the data without producing ripples due to sharp voltage steps, as demonstrated in Figure 1. Refer to the work by Reichenbach and colleagues27 for a more complex 3rd order polynomial interpolation.\nApply the subtraction method:\n\t\nFor each experimental block, including a no-TMS control condition if present, calculate an averaged ERP to the blank screen trials by time-locking them to trial start (as if an image had been presented).\nSubtract this averaged template from each trial of all other stimulus conditions. If several blocks were run for the same stimulation site, do this separately for each block, as the template will be slightly different between the blocks.\nAll other preprocessing and processing steps are carried out as in any other ERP experiment.\nSubscription Required.
