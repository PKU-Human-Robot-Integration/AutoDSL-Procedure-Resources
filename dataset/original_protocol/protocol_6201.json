    "Fabrication of 3D microstructure array on ChipTake the clean Si wafer and Spin-coat with photoresist polymer (THB 151N at 163.56 x g [1200 rpm]) to obtain a resist layer of about 50 μm thickness. To achieve a higher thickness for 100 and 150 μm SAF structures, repeat the spin coating step 2-3 times.After spin coating, bake Silicon wafer at 70 °C for 3-5 min. The thickness of photoresist coating is chosen to obtain structures with an aspect ratio of about 1, ideal for injection molding.Perform edge bead removal to obtain a thickness uniformity under ± 2 μm over the 4-inch wafer area (Figure 1A). The edge bead removal is performed with the robotic arm of the spin coater by dropping continuously acetone solution (to dissolve photoresist) at the edge and continuous spin at 1000 rpm at the same time). Due to the spinning of the wafer, the solution moves outwards so it does not affect the rest of the coating of Silicon wafer.Execute the FAPL process with a mask pattern of round holes with diameters ranging from 50 to 200 μm using hard contact mode.Load the wafer into the tilting stage, fixed at a given tilt angle and rotated clockwise at 15 rpm and while delivering a dose of 1500 mJ/cm2 throughout the UV exposure.Note: The photoresist refractive index and the necessity of a 60-degree tilt on the final SAF structures lead to a fixed tilt angle θrot = 52.3 degrees (Figure 1B). After the UV exposure, automated equipment (Gamma Cluster System 2M, Suss MicroTech) is used to develop the wafers by exposing them to 10 puddles of AZ726 MIF developer for 60 s. Later, rinse the wafers with deionized water before final drying.",
    "The sputter Nickel Vanadium (Ni/V) = 80 nm or (Chromium (Cr)/ Gold (Au) = 20/60 nm metal Cr/Au seed bilayer together with sputtering 1 μm thick Aluminum (Al) sacrificial layer (Kurt J Lesker) (Figure 1C).Perform the Ni electroplating (Microform.200, Technotrans) in three steps by increasing the current in 3 steps. The current goes up linearly from 0 to 0.5 A during the first 15 min, and from 0.5 to 1.5 A for the next 15 min. As soon as the current reaches up to 17 A, keep it constant for 6 h and after that decline it to 0 with a slow rate. The current density should not drop suddenly to minimize the residual stress and achieve a thickness of 350 μm. After electroplating, Si is etched out in a KOH bath at 80 °C. Then the remaining Ni shim is cut in required size for installation in injection molding machine (ENGEL Victory 80/45 Tech).Use TOPAS 5013L COC pellets for injection molding for polymer chip. The polymers get dry in the hopper of injection molder (airflow at 90 °C) and extra moisture is removed.The temperature of injection molding cylinder is increased gradually from 250 °C as polymer exited the hopper to reach 300 °C at the nozzle. Molten COC gets injected into the mold at a speed of 21 cm3/s and a pressure of 600 bars as presented in Video 1.The mold temperature may vary (Variotherm process) from 155 °C (at the moment of injection) to 103 °C when the demolding is performed. Also, a packing pressure of injection molding (600 bars) is applied for 6 s injection molded to produce the structures into the microfluidic device. The final chips had the dimensions of a microscope slide (76 mm x 25 mm x 1 mm).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1.",
    "A schematic video of the Injection molding machine to present the molding process Perform the precise spotting on each SAF structure in an array by sciFLEXARRAYER S5 (SCIENION, Germany). Take a glass tip (Type 1) and use it in washing step each time before and after changing the sample for spotting in the software program. This process is automated and controlled by the software developed by SCIENION.Solid phase PCRDNA preparationStreptococcus pneumoniae is from the culture collection of The National Food Institute, Technical University of Denmark (DTU-Food). Isolate S. pneumonia genomic DNA using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, Germany) as instructed by the supplier. Determine DNA concentration with Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific, USA). Record DNA concentration in ng/μl and quality scores (260/280 and 260/230). Store the DNA at -20 °C for further use.Report the cut-offs you used for high-quality DNA. The 260/280 ratio of less than 1.7 can be indicative of poor quality DNA. Most studies have cut-offs for 260/280 and 260/230.PrimersTo make a model to confirm the performance of SP-PCR on FAPL-generated SAF structures for pathogen detection, we selected one pair of a forward and a Cyanine-3 (Cy3)-labeled reverse primer (Table 1) to amplify pneumolysin gene as target sequence for S. pneumoniae detection in the liquid phase (Greiner et al., 2001). A Primer-BLAST from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) is used to design a nested probe as the surface primer based on pneumolysin gene sequence for SP-PCR. A random sequence from S. pyogenes genome is used as the surface primer for non-target amplification.Immobilization of surface primersPrepare 100 μl solution of surface primer containing 50 μM of poly (T) poly (C)-tagged surface primers containing 5x SSC and 0.004% Triton X-100 at final concentration.",
