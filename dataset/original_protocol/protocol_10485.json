    "1. Preparation of Labeling and Fixation Reagents\nPrepare labeling buffer (BSA-GEL-PBS) using autoclaved phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 (PBS). Supplement with 1% BSA (bovine albumin fraction V, biotin-free) and 0.2% gelatin (GEL, from cold water fish skin) and vortex/shake well.\n\tNote: Can be stored for ~5 days at 4 °C.\nPrepare washing buffer (BSA-PBS) from autoclaved phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4. Supplement with 1% BSA and vortex/shake well. Note: Can be stored for ~5 days at 4 °C.\nPrepare 50 mM borate buffer (BB) from 200 mM boric acid stock solution, pH adjusted to 8.3 with 200 mM sodium tetraborate. Note: Can be stored for ~12 months at 4 °C.\nPrepare 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (CB) from 0.2 M sodium cacodylate stock solution, pH adjusted to 7.4, supplemented with 0.1 M sucrose.\n\tNote: Opened stock solution can be stored for ~5 days at 4 °C.\nPrepare 0.1 M glycine in PBS (GLY–PBS).\n\tNote: Can be stored for ~2 months at 4 °C.\nPrepare 3% paraformaldehyde in CB (3% PFA) from freshly made or opened vial of 16% PFA, stock solution, EM grade.\n\tNote: Opened stock solution can be stored for ~5 days at 4 °C.\nPrepare 2% glutaraldehyde in CB (2% GA) from freshly made (or opened vial of) 25% GA stock solution, EM grade.\n\tNote: Opened stock solution can be stored for ~5 days at 4 °C.\nPrepare 300 nM EGF-biotin labeling solution\n\t\nDilute 6 µM EGF-biotin stock solution in BSA-GEL-PBS, use a volume of 100-200 µl per microchip. Use within a few hr.\nPrepare 10 nM STR-QD labeling solution",
    "Centrifuge the streptavidin-QD stock solution for 4 min at 8,000 x g, take supernatant and dilute 1:10 in BB. Different types of QDs can be used, for example, QD655, or QD800. Dilute to final concentration in BSA-GEL-PBS, use 75-100 µl per microchip. Use within a few hr.\n2. Preparation of Silicon Nitride Membrane Microchips\nClean a microscope glass slide, as used for light microscopy, with a clean room tissue and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade ethanol.\nIn a laminar airflow workbench with a low dust level, open a 100 mm diameter Petri dish, and lay the cleaned microscope glass into the dish; leave the dish open.\nWith clean tweezers, preferentially coated with carbon fiber or other coating, take 4-10 microchips with thin (50 nm) silicon nitride membranes, one after the other, out of their storage box and onto the glass slide. Grab the microchips gently at their sides and avoid touching the fragile upper side, consisting of the thin silicon nitride membrane. Take great care to always keep the membrane side up and do not touch it.\n\tNote: The microchips should be rectangular and have flat edges perpendicular to their silicon nitride covered face, so that they can be gripped easily.\nClose the lid of the petri dish and bring it to a fume hood. Get a new clean room tissue and deposit it beside the petri dish. Prepare two clean 200 ml glass beakers by filling one with 50-70 ml acetone, and the other with a similar volume of ethanol, both of HPLC grade. Transfer the microchips from the glass slide first onto the clean room tissue.",
    "From the tissue, transfer microchips one by one into the first beaker with acetone for removing the protective resist layer. Wait 2 min, while gently moving the beaker a few times to ensure that the microchips are well rinsed.\nTransfer the microchips directly into the beaker with ethanol, without letting them dry out. Wait 2 min. Then transfer the beaker to the laminar airflow workbench. Get a new clean room tissue.\nTransfer the chips onto the tissue and let them dry for a few min. Transfer the microchips onto the glass slide in the Petri dish, close the dish, and bring it to the plasma cleaner.\nDeposit the glass slide with the microchips into the plasma cleaner. Run a 5 min cleaning program to render the surface of the silicon nitride membrane hydrophilic.\n\tNote: Suitable settings applied for our plasma cleaner are: 70 mTorr, gas flow of 11.5 sccm for O2 and 35.0 sccm for Ar, 50 W forward radio frequency (RF) target, 5 W RF range and max. reflected RF.\nPut the glass slide with the microchip back into the petri dish, and close its lid. Take care to keep the microchips sterile from now on.\nExamine the window areas of the microchips under a light microscope for possible membrane ruptures or remaining dirt particles.\nBring the petri dish to the laminar airflow workbench.\nPlace the following items in the laminar airflow workbench: tubes/bottles containing sterilized 0.01% poly-L-lysine solution (PLL, mol. wt 150,000–300,000, sterile-filtered, and cell culture tested), HPLC grade water, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, DMEM without serum, a new clean room tissue, a sterile 24-well plate (a 12-well plate can also be used), a sterile 96-well plate, sterile pipet tips, a pipette, and flat, rounded tip, tweezers.",
    "Take the 24-well plate, and fill one well with PLL, and two wells with HPLC grade water, use an approx. volume of 1 ml per well. Take the 96-well plate and fill for every microchip two wells with serum supplemented DMEM and one well with serum-free DMEM, use an approx. volume of 200 µl per well.\nFrom now on use tweezers with sterile tips to handle the microchips. Achieve this, for instance, by briefly flaming and subsequently cooling off the tips of the tweezers.\nFirst transfer the microchips from the glass slide onto the clean room tissue.\n\tFrom the tissue, transfer up to six microchips into the PLL-filled well, incubate the microchips for 5 min.\n\tNote: For an experiment with more microchips, fill additional wells in the 24-well plate.\nSubsequently rinse the microchips by placing them, one-by-one, into the first water-filled well, and from there into the second water-filled well. Don't leave the microchips in the water longer than about a minute to avoid removal of PLL.\nFinally place them individually into the DMEM-filled wells of the 96-well plate. Store the 96-well plate in the CO2 incubator until the cell suspension is prepared.\n3. Preparation of Cells on Microchips\nPerform a subculture of COS7 cells to prepare a cell suspension with a concentration of approx. 5 × 105 cells/ml. Make sure the cells are mono-dispersed.\nTake the 96-well plate with the microchips and add one droplet of cell suspension to each microchip. Wait 5 min.\nStart to examine the window areas of the microchips with an inverted microscope to choose the right moment for transferring it into a new well with serum-free DMEM.",
    "Note: A good density of cells is achieved with approximately one cell per 2,500 µm2 area, corresponding to 24 COS7 cells on a window size of 150 x 400 µm. Higher cell densities have the risk to hinder maximal flattening of the cells. Be aware that after a cell has settled down onto the SIN membrane, it needs 3-5 min to develop enough adhesion to resist floating off during transfer into the new well.\nTransfer microchip to the next well when sufficient cells have adhered onto the window. Keep the microchips always with the cells facing up and avoid any touching of this side.\nAfter the transfer, examine each microchip window again. If too many cells were washed off and the number of remaining cells is insufficient, re-triturate the cell suspension (to break up newly formed cell clumps) and repeat steps 3.1-3.5.\nWhen all transferred microchips have enough adhering cells on their window areas, transfer the chips into the last well with serum-free DMEM. Place the 96-well plate back into the CO2 incubator and let the cells recover and flatten out for several hr, best O/N.\n4. EGFR Labeling, Fixation, and Fluorescence Microscopy\nFor the following steps, use a 96-well and a 24-well plate. Pre-fill wells with the respective solutions, and use one row or column per microchip. The 24- well plate is used under the fume hood for the fixation steps with CB, PFA and GA. Always transfer microchips with the cells facing up and avoid any touching of this side.\nRinse microchips by placing the microchips in a well with fresh BSA-GEL-PBS, then place 96 well plate in incubator at 37 °C for 5 min.",
    "Incubate with 300 nM EGF-biotin solution for 3 min at 37 °C. Because the cells will start endocytosis of EGF-labeled EGFRs, proceed as fast as possible to step 4.4.\nRinse 3 times with PBS, and 1 time with CB (now the 96 well plate is again at RT).\nIncubate in 3% PFA for 10 min.\nRinse chips 1 time with CB, and 3 times with PBS.\nIncubate in GLY-PBS for 2 min, rinse 2 times with 1 time PBS.\nIncubate in 10 nM STR-QD for 10 min.\nRinse 4 times with BSA-PBS.\nSubmerge a microchip in a glass-bottom 35 mm dish pre-filled with BSA-PBS at RT.\nAcquire differential interference contrast (DIC) images and fluorescence images of QD-labeled cells.\n\t\nUse a 40X air objective for overview images of cells labeled with QD655. Use an oil immersion objective (for example, 63X) to allow the most efficient collection of the emitted fluorescence light; this is especially needed when imaging cells labeled with QD800.\nUse a filter cube that exposes the QDs to fluorescence excitation light between 340 and 380 nm, and allows the collection of emitted light above 420 nm suitable for most QDs (Filter cube A in this case).\nMinimize the light intensity to avoid too intense light that might damage the sample. Set the exposure time to at least 300 msec, so that the signals of all QDs are captured, noting that the fluorescence of QDs has a blinking behavior.\nAdjust the light intensity, and the amplification to provide bright images without visible image noise, while minimizing the light intensity.\n\t\tNote: Alternatively, shorter exposure time can be used if image series are taken from the same region. These series can be processed to yield a maximum projection image, leading to averaging and thus noise reduction of the resulting image.",
    "Place the imaged microchip back (cells facing up) into a well of a 96-well plate filled with BSA-PBS.\nRinse microchips 1 times in CB.\nIncubate in 2% GA for 10 min.\nRinse 1 time in CB, and 3 times with BSA-PBS.\nStore microchips until ESEM imaging, in BSA-PBS pre-filled wells of a new 96-well plate. For every microchip fill a row of four wells with HPLC-grade water.\n\tNote: The samples can be kept at 4 °C for several weeks, however, the best results are achieved when the complete imaging series is performed within two days. QDs will slowly start to detach from the sample, it is therefore not recommended to wait more than 10 days before the ESEM imaging is done.\n\tNote: Fluorescence images are stored for future analysis. The positions of the cells in the images can easily be correlated with electron microscopy images via localizing the corners of the SiN window and measuring the positions relative to the corners.\n\tNote: It is advisable to print high quality fluorescence images and use them for orientation purposes when recording the ESEM images.\n5. Wet ESEM-STEM of Whole Cells\nPrepare the ESEM for wet STEM\n\t\nMount the gaseous secondary electron detector (GSED), and the Peltier stage, containing the STEM detector (located under the sample).\nStart the flow of cooling water through the stage, and set the temperature to 3 °C.\nSet the stage x-y coordinates to zero, and adjust the working distance to approximately 6 mm.\nDuring the ESEM imaging, keep the 96-well plate with the microchips cool, for instance on frozen cooling elements, in a Styrofoam box.",
    "For loading a sample into the precooled ESEM-STEM stage, take the 96-well plate out of the cooling container and place it close to the opened ESEM stage. Put a new clean room tissue beside it.\nQuickly rinse a microchip (with the cells facing up) by dipping it four times, each time for about a second, into a well filled with HPLC-grade water.\nBlot the backside of the microchip briefly on the clean room tissue and place the microchip into the precooled stage. Make sure that the cells remain wet, this can be recognized by a reflective surface (drying results in a dull surface).\nWet the sample surface with 3 µl of cooled HPLC-grade water (make sure not to touch the surface with the pipet tip), and fix the sample in the stage.\nPlace three additional 3 µl water droplets on the stage close to the sample.\nClose the specimen chamber\nPurge the specimen chamber by cycling the pressure five times between 800 and 1,500 Pa. End the cycling with 800 Pa.\nSwitch the electron beam (30 kV) on and examine the sample under the lowest magnification with both detectors, i.e., the GSED, and the STEM detector to search for the location of the microchip window.\n\tNote: If the water layer is too thick, the window may not be visible. In this case, start lowering the pressure to 760 Pa and wait a few min. The window first becomes visible with the GSED.\nPosition the SiN membrane window in the center of the image by moving the specimen stage and reduce the pressure to 750-720 Pa.\n\tNote: When the water layer is thin enough, the window also becomes visible with the STEM detector.",
    "From now on use the dark field segment of the STEM detector to record images. First, acquire one or two images showing all cells on the complete window area.\nCompare these ESEM images with the light microscopy images, locate the corners of the SiN window.\nCorrelate the coordinate frames of both microscopy modalities by comparing the magnification, rotation, and possible mirroring. Locate the same cells in both images.\nSelect very small dirt particles or a cell region with small features to adjust imaging settings, such as the eucentric height, the fine focus and the correction of lens stigmatism. Work at a magnification of at least 50.000X, use an electron probe current around 0.6 nA, a pixel-dwell time of 30 µs, and an image size of 1024 x 884 pixels.\n\tNote: Other settings may also be used as long as an increase of the electron dose is avoided.\n\tNote: Even when working very clean, the chip surfaces will in practice always contain some dirt particles, because the protocol is not executed in a clean room environment.\nTo record STEM images from the QD-labeled cells, refer to the fluorescence images and choose a cell of interest.\n\tNote: It is best to start with a cell showing strong QD signals.\nRecord a STEM overview image of this cell.\nGo to a peripheral region where the cell border is visible and zoom in to reach 50.000X magnification.\nRecord images showing individual QDs, use pixel dwell times of 20-30 µsec. In order to avoid radiation damage, image every region only once with high magnification.\n\tNote: Usually, at this stage both, the focus and the correction of the stigmatism, need some fine adjustment.",
    "After the recording of a sufficient number of high magnification images, zoom-out, and acquire another STEM overview image, depicting the regions just recorded with high-magnification as dark rectangles.\n\tNote: These overview images will later serve to correlate ESEM and fluorescence images and to determine the precise location of the high magnification images within the cellular context.\nProceed to the next cell of interest, start with an overview image, record a series of high magnification images, and end with an overview image.\nAt the end of an ESEM imaging session, increase the pressure to 850-900 Pa before starting to vent the chamber.\n\tNote: This increase of pressure improves the chance of recovering the microchip with a still wetted surface; however, this cannot always be achieved. A sample that has never been dried out can be restored in BSA-PBS and, if desired, reinvestigated in the ESEM at a later point in time."
