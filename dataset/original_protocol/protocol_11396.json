    "1. Colony Formation Assays\nCulture A549 cells at a concentration of 20,000 cells/cm2 in 15 mL of RPMI1640 cell culture medium supplemented with 10% FBS (Fetal Bovine Serum) and 1% antibiotics in a 75 cm2 flask in a CO2 incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nOn the day of the experiment, determine the cell concentration by using a hemocytometer. Collect 50,000 cells by centrifugation at 400 x g for 7 min in a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and re-suspend cells in 100 µL of 1x sterile PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) in 1.5 mL tubes.\nDispense 1.1 mL of semi-solid methylcellulose-based medium (MCBM) in 15 mL tubes with a multipipette. Prepare one tube for each condition.\nAdd 110 µL of FBS to 1.1 mL of MCBM using a P200 micropipette.\nSeeds cells at 1,000 cells/mL. Collect 2.4 µL of cell suspension from the stock solution (50,000 cells in 100 µL of 1x PBS) using a P2 micropipette and add to 1.1 mL of MCBM supplemented with 10% FBS.\nAfter adding the cells, vortex the tubes for 1 min, holding them vertically at the highest speed to mix MCBM and cells well.\nAdd test compounds (OT48 alone or in combination with A1210477). Prepare a separate tube as a control for the solvent used (here dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)). Depending on the concentration of the compounds and the volume added for each condition, the solvent control will include the highest concentration of solvent used for the dilutions of the test compound, to assess for adverse effects caused by the solvent.\nVortex tubes for 1 minute.\nFor each assay, add 1 mL of the mixture with a P1000 micropipette to the center well of a 12-well cell culture plate.\nFill empty wells with 1 mL of sterile water or 1x PBS to stabilize humidity.",
    "Incubate culture plates for 10 days in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nAfter 10 days of incubation, add 200 µL of an MTT (methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) stock solution (5 mg/mL) to each well to reach a final concentration of 1 mg/mL.\nIncubate 10 min in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Viable colonies will turn violet.\nCapture the image using a digital camera using the white background plate (LAS white dia tray). Use the following settings: Method, digitize; Exposure type, precision; Exposure time, manual, 1 second; Sensitivity/resolution, high resolution. Save the image in tiff format.\nQuantify viable colonies by using ImageJ software. Select menu \"Image | Type | 8 bit\". Select menu \"Adjust | Threshold\". Set threshold to control and keep constant for all conditions; Select menu \"Analyze | Analyze Particles\". Save data and analyze with a statistics software for graphical representation.\n2. Spheroid Formation Assay\nCulture A549 cells at a concentration of 20,000 cells/cm2 in 75 cm2 flasks with 15 mL of RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics.\nOn the day of the experiment, prepare a 96 well U-bottom plate.\nPlate 10,000 cells into a well which already contains the compound of interest (here 50 µM of OT48 and/or 20 µM of A1210477). Adjust the final volume to 100 µL of cell culture medium. The number of cells that form uniform spheroids with an intact outer boundary is considered adequate to form spheroids.\nIncubate for 3 days in an incubator at 37 °C and at 5% CO2.\nAfter 3 days of incubation, capture images of the spheroids using a light microscope with 4x magnification.\n3. Zebrafish Xenograft Assay\nNOTE: This technical approach is visualized as a schematic (Figure 1).\nPreparation of stock reagents",
    "Prepare 1 L of 30x Danieau’s solution: 1740 mM NaCl, 21 mM KCl, 12 mM MgSO4∙7H2O, 18 mM Ca(NO3)2, and 150 mM HEPES. Adjust to the pH of the buffer to 7.6 using a pH meter.\nPrepare 1% (50x) tricaine solution: Dissolve 20 mg of ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate (tricaine) in 2 mL of distilled water.\nPrepare 1% phenol Red-PBS solution: Add 2 µL of Phenol Red sodium salt solution to 198 µL of sterilized PBS solution in a 1.5 µL tube.\nPrepare 3% methylcellulose: Add 3 g of methylcellulose to 100 mL of 1x Danieau’s solution.\nZebrafish egg production and incubation\nSeparate one female and one male zebrafish in a partition tank filled with UV-sterilized and filtered tap water at 28.5 °C in the dark. After 24 h of separation, mix fish of both genders to initiate mating. Transfer fertilized eggs from the mating tank to a Petri dish containing 5 mL of fresh Danieau’s solution.\nWash eggs three times with 5 mL of Danieau’s solution. For the washing, carefully aspirate the eggs with a pipette and transfer to 5 mL of fresh solution. Incubate for 8 h at 28.5 °C.\n\t\t\nAfter 8 h of incubation in Danieau's solution, change to Danieau's solution containing 0.03% 1-phenyl-2-thiourea (PTU) to inhibit pigmentation. Sort out opaque eggs (unfertilized or containing undeveloped embryos) to prevent contamination.\nEmbryo dechorionation\n24 h post fertilization (hpf), dechorionate zebrafish embryos using sharp forceps. Incubate hatching embryos in Danieau’s solution with 0.03% PTU at 28.5 °C until 48 hpf.\nCompound-treated cell preparation",
    "Seed A549 cells at 20,000 cells/cm2 in 25 cm2 culture flasks. After 24 h of seeding, add compounds (here OT48 at 50 µM and and/or A1210477 at 20 µM) for 24 h in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Set up the treatment time for each compound to maintain the viability of the cells but to commit them towards cell death. This time point needs to be individually set up based on cell viability, morphology and molecular markers.\n2 h before the end of the treatment, stain cells with 4 µM of fluorescent cell tracker dye CM-Dil at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After 2 h of incubation, trypsinize cells with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA, and dilute 106 cells in 50 µL of phenol Red-PBS solution prior to injection.\nMicro-injection of cancer cells for xenograft formation\nAnesthetize zebrafish in a 0.02% tricaine solution for 5 min until they settle down on an agar plate.\nPull a 1.0 mm (outside diameter (OD) glass capillary) by a micropipette puller (Program settings: P: 300, Heat: 260, Pull: 60, VEL: 50, and Time: 200). Cut the microcapillary with a syringe to produce a sharp edge. Load microcapillaries with 20 µL of cell/phenol Red-PBS solution. Set injection pressure and time to dispense 2 nL per injection.\nInject 100–200 cells into the yolk sac by injecting 6 to 10 nL via 3 to 5 injections. After injection, allow fish to recover for 10 to 30 min in 5 mL of fresh Danieau’s solution containing PTU solution. Dispatch fish in 24-well plates with 1 mL of Danieau's solution containing PTU solution are and incubate for 72 h at 28.5 °C.",
    "After 72 h of incubation, anesthetize fish in a 0.02% tricaine solution and immobilize on a glass slide with a drop of 3% methylcellulose. Take 5x pictures by fluorescence microscopy at a wavelength of 620 to 750 nm.\nQuantify the size of fluorescent tumors by ImageJ software. Select menu \"Analyze | Measure\". Save values corresponding to the fluorescent signal and analyze with a statistics software for graphical representation.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
