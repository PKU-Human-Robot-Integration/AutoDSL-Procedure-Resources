    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nTreat cells with NAI or DMSO and UV crosslink\nTiming: 3 h\nTreat cells with the structure probing reagent NAI or mock treat with DMSO, followed by UV crosslinking to covalently link RNA binding proteins to bound RNA molecules. Complete these steps for all protocol types: fSHAPE-eCLIP, SHAPE-eCLIP, or “in vitro” SHAPE-eCLIP.\nCell sample requirements\nGrow cells to ∼30–40 million cells per sample. With two treatment conditions each needing at least two replicates, this adds up to at least four samples, 120–160 million cells total.\nfSHAPE-eCLIP and SHAPE-eCLIP both consist of two RNA treatment conditions performed in parallel. The different conditions are referred to here as “A”, “B”, or “C” (see Graphical Abstract):\nfSHAPE-eCLIP consists of one set of cells treated with NAI (“A”), i.e., RNA is treated in vivo. The other set is mock-treated with DMSO, but later treated with NAI once its RNA is in vitro (“B”).\nSHAPE-eCLIP consists of one set of cells treated with NAI (“A”) and the other mock-treated with DMSO (“C“). An “in vitro” variant of SHAPE-eCLIP consists of two sets of samples that are both mock-treated with DMSO at the cell stage, but one set later treats RNA with NAI in vitro (“B“).\nSetup\nPre-chill on ice 100 mL 1X PBS.\nSet an incubator to 37°C.\nPre-chill on ice metal plate that fits inside crosslinker. Set crosslinker to 400 mJ/cm2 and 2 min. Crosslinker should emit UV-C light at ∼254 nm wavelengths.\nFetch some dry ice.\nTreat cells with the structure probing reagent (NAI) or mock-treat with DMSO\nSplit cells into 30–40 million cells per sample, two samples for each treatment condition.Instructions are for suspension cells; see note below on adherent cells.",
    "Reduce each cell sample volume to 2 mL in plain media (no FBS) in 10 cm plates.\nPer sample pair: For “A” conditions (in fSHAPE-eCLIP or SHAPE-eCLIP), add 170 uL 2 M NAI structure probing reagent to each sample. For “B” or “C” conditions (in fSHAPE-eCLIP or the “in vitro” variant of SHAPE-eCLIP), add 170 uL DMSO to each sample. Swirl to mix.\nIncubate plates at 37°C for 10 min.\nUV crosslink cells and wash\nPlace pre-chilled metal plate into crosslinker and place plates on top. The chilled plate prevents cells from heating up during crosslinking.\nRemove lids from plates. Run the pre-set crosslinking program.\nMove cells from plates to 15 mL conicals. Spin down at 500 g for 3 min.\nRemove supernatant (NAI-treated supernatant should go into its own waste container).\nResuspend cells in 5 mL cold PBS. Spin down and remove supernatant as before. Resuspend again with cold PBS.\nSpin down cells one more time, remove PBS supernatant, and flash freeze cells in dry ice. Store at −80°C.\nCritical: Removing lids from plates before crosslinking is critical to cells being properly crosslinked.\nNote: Adherent cells should have media removed and replaced with 2 mL plain media (no FBS) and subsequently treated with 170 uL NAI or DMSO, swirling to mix. Cells should then be crosslinked as instructed, then scraped off plates with a cell scraper and transferred to 15 mL conicals, following the same washing and centrifugation steps outlined for suspension cells.\nPause point: Cell pellets can be stored at −80°C for months.\nLyse cells and immunoprecipitate RNA\nTiming: 3–16 h\nLyse protein-bound RNA from cells. Pull down RNA bound to the protein of interest with a monoclonal antibody coupled to magnetic beads. Complete these steps for all protocol types.\nSetup\nPre-chill eCLIP Lysis Buffer.\nThaw Protease Inhibitor.",
    "Bioruptor sonicator water tank should be at 4°C (in a cold room).\nPre-heat Thermomixer to 37°C.\nPre-set 1.5 mL tube centrifuge to 4°C.\nCouple antibody to Dynabeads M-280\nPrepare beads.\nUse 125 μL beads per sample, 500 μL for two conditions each with two replicates.\nApply bead solution to magnet; remove supernatant.\nWash beads twice in 500 μL cold eCLIP Lysis Buffer.\nResuspend beads in 100 μL cold eCLIP Lysis Buffer for every sample, typically 400 μL.\nBind antibody.\nAdd 10 μg antibody per sample to prepared beads.\nRotate at 15°C–25°C for 45 min.\nLyse cells, while beads are rotating\nFor two replicates—four samples total—combine 4 mL eCLIP Lysis Buffer with 22 μL Protease Inhibitor Cocktail III and 44 μL Murine RNase Inhibitor.\nRetrieve cell pellets from −80°C, keeping on dry ice. Immediately add 1 mL master mix from 7a to each pellet, pipetting to resuspend. Move each sample to a 1.5 mL tube.\nPlace on ice (not dry ice) and allow to lyse for 5 min.\nFragment RNA\nSonicate lysed samples in Bioruptor on “low”, 4°C, 5 cycles of 30 s on and 30 s off. This assists cell lysis and shears chromatin, aiding release of RNA-protein complexes.\nNote: Alternatively, sonication may be done on ice with a probe sonicator, sonicating each sample twice at 5 decibels in 10 second bursts. Avoid touching the side of tube with sonicator.\nDilute 1 μL RNase I in PBS at 1:50 on ice.\nAdd 10 μL Turbo DNase to each lysed sonicated sample.\nAdd 10 μL diluted RNase I (20 U total) to each sample.

Treat RNA and ligate an adapter, later used for reverse transcription.\nSetup\nVerify High Salt Wash Buffer, Wash Buffer, and 1x FastAP Buffers are cold.\nPre-heat Thermomixer to 37°C.\nSet aside non-immunoprecipitated sample controls, referred to as “Input” samples\nOf the sample conditions (“A”,”B”, or “C”; see 1b for naming convention), pick one condition to take sample Input controls from. Typically “B” or “C” conditions. One can carry forward Input controls for all conditions if one chooses, but this creates more controls than is necessary.\nGently mix samples from 9e well.
