    "1. Design of BDs of SINEUP Constructs for Target mRNAs\nCheck transcription starting site (TSS) and translation starting site of target mRNAs in the cells of interest. Acquire TSS data from both the ENCODE and FANTOM projects (cap analysis of gene expression, CAGE) (ZENBU: http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/zenbu/).\nOpen the browser, search genes of interest and check TSS by CAGE peaks.\nConsult the example analysis of cell and tissue specific TSS of Parkinson disease protein 7 (PARK7) mRNA shown in Figure 2.\nDesign BD sequences of several different lengths corresponding to 40 bases upstream and 32 bases downstream of the first methionine (AUG), 72 nt in total.\nCustom order the designed BDs in SINEUP expression vector (see Table of Materials).\nNOTE: Check the sequence specificity by basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) to avoid off-target effects26.\n2. Cell Culture and SINEUP Transfection\nSeed cells of interest in a 6 well-plate or 24 well-plate for 24 h before transfection of SINEUPs. In the case of human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293T/17) (see Table of Materials), seed 0.5 x 106 cells per well of a 6 well-plate or 1.5 x 105 cells per well of a poly-D-lysine coated 24 well-plate (see Table of Materials). It becomes 70% confluent after 24 h.",
    "After 24 h, change the medium to 1.5 mL of fresh medium for a 6 well-plate or 0.4 mL of fresh medium for a 24 well-plate. In case of SINEUP-GFP, transfect 0.6 µg of pEGFP-C2 (see Table of Materials) and 3.4 µg of SINEUP-GFP in one well of a 6 well-plate or 130 ng of pEGFP-C2 and 670 ng of SINEUP-GFP in one well of a 24 well-plate with transfection reagent (10 µL in 6 well-plate and 3 µL in 24 well-plate) by following the manufacturer’s instructions (see Table of Materials), and incubate at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h.\nWash cells with 2 mL of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) (37 mM NaCl, 8 mM Na2HPO4, 2.6 mM KCl and 1.5 mM KH2PO4) in each well of a 6 well-plate or 0.5 mL of PBS in each well of a 24 well-plate. Only for poly-D-lysine coated 24 well-plate, add 25 µL of 0.05% weight per volume Trypsin, incubate in a 5% CO2 incubator for 5 min and add 275 µL of cell medium per well. In case of 6 well-plate, add 2 mL of PBS in each well. Pipet up and down to harvest 3/4 of cells (1.5 mL for a 6 well-plate or 225 µL for a 24 well-plate) from 1 well for protein extraction (go to protocol 3 for protein extraction) and 1/4 of cells (0.5 mL for a 6 well-plate or 75 µL for a 24 well-plate) for RNA extraction and  centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C (go to step 5 for RNA extraction).\nNOTE: Analyze the effect of SINEUP-GFP in a poly-D-lysine coated 24 well-plate by imaging. Go to step 7 (imaging analysis).\n3. Protein Extraction",
    "Carefully aspirate 1.5 mL of PBS and add 140 µL of lysis solution (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na2EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% (w/v) Triton, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 μg/mL leupeptin, and 0.005% (w/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)) (see Table of Materials) for a 6 well-plate or 60 µL for a 24 well-plate to the cell pellets.\nMix by pipetting and then mix thoroughly by rotating at slow speed for 1 h at 4 °C.

Prepare all the reactions at room temperature.\nPrepare 5-6 times dilution of bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein standard in ultrapure water with concentrations ranging from 0.2-1.5 mg/mL protein. Prepare fresh standards each time.\nPrepare working reagent Aʹ by mixing 1 mL of reagent A (alkaline copper tartrate solution) with 20 µL of reagent S (surfactant solution).\nLoad 5 µL of water (negative control), BSA standard (protein standard and positive control) or protein sample in each well of a 96-well-plate.\nAdd 25 µL of reagent Aʹ in each well. Carefully add 200 µL of reagent B (Folin reagent) per well avoiding any bubble formation. Cover the plate with aluminum foil and wait for 5-10 min.\nMeasure the protein absorbance at 750 nm with a spectrophotometer. The absorbance is stable for at least 1 h.\nPrepare standard curve by plotting BSA standard protein concentrations (mg/mL) on the x-axis and their respective absorbance on the y-axis. Calculate sample protein concentration by applying standard curve equation.",
    "NOTE: Pause the protocol at this step if needed or go to step 4. For long-term storage, snap freeze protein samples in liquid nitrogen and store at -80 °C.\n4. Protein Separation by SDS-PAGE and Detection of Target Proteins with Antibodies (Western-blot Analysis)\nAdd one volume of 2x loading dye (0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 1.42% 2-mercaptethanol and 0.2% bromophenol blue) to each volume of protein sample from step 3.3. Heat at 90 °C for 5 min and immediately cool on ice for 1 min.\nLoad 10-20 µg of protein samples to 10% SDS poly-acrylamide gel and separate at 100-150 V) (see Table of Materials).\nTransfer protein from gel to 0.45-µm nitrocellulose membrane (see Table of Materials) by semi-dry transfer instrument with transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine and 20% methanol) at 25 V for 30 min.\nAdd blocking solution (5% non-fat dry milk in 1x TBST buffer (137 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.1% Tween-20)) (see Table of Materials) to the container until the membrane is completely soaked and incubate it at room temperature for 30 min.\nIn the case of SINEUP-GFP, hybridize the protein with anti-GFP antibody (diluted 1:2000 in blocking solution) (see Table of Materials) by incubating the membrane for 30 min with shaking at room temperature. As an internal control protein, detect β-actin protein by hybridizing with Anti-β-Actin antibody (diluted 1:2000 in blocking solution) (see Table of Materials) for 30 min with shaking at room temperature.\nAdd 1x TBST buffer to the container until the membrane is completely soaked and wash for 5 min at room temperature. Repeat the wash step two more times (a total of three washes).",
    "Hybridize GFP protein to diluted (1:1000 in blocking solution) anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and hybridize β-actin protein to diluted (1:1000 in blocking solution) anti-mouse antibody conjugated with HRP on the membrane for 30 min with shaking at room temperature.\nWash membrane with 1x TBST buffer for 5 min at room temperature. Repeat the wash step two more times (a total of three washes).\nMix equal volume of HRP-enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection reagent 1 and 2 (see Table of Materials).

Carefully remove the membrane from ECL reagent mix and expose using a luminescence imaging instrument.\n5. RNA Extraction and DNase Treatment\nExtract total RNA following the standard protocol for RNA extraction from cells grown in a monolayer27 or alternatively use a commercially available RNA extraction kit (see Table of Materials). To state in brief, add any monophasic lysis reagent (MLR) of guanidine isothiocyanate and phenol to the harvested cells in step 2.3 (1 mL MLR per ~5 million cells)27.\nNOTE: Change gloves frequently. Use RNase-free reagents, and diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated plastic ware and glassware to prevent RNA degradation. Pause the protocol at this step if needed. Store extracted RNA at -80 °C.\nAdd 0.1 volume of 10x DNase buffer and 2 U of DNase to the purified RNA from step 5.1 (see Table of Materials).\nSet the reaction volume to 50 µL with nuclease-free water and mix gently. Incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.\nAdd 0.1 volume of re-suspended DNase inactivation reagent and mix well (see Table of Materials). Incubate for 5 min at room temperature with gentle shaking.",
    "Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 90 s. Transfer the supernatant (DNA-free RNA) to a fresh RNase-free 1.5 mL tube. Be careful not to touch the pellet because this can cause carry-over of DNase which is troublesome for downstream steps.\nQuantitate RNA by measuring A260 and A260/A280 ratio (for pure RNA, the range is 1.8-2.0) in a UV spectrophotometer.\n6. First Strand cDNA Synthesis and qRT-PCR Analysis\nPerform first strand cDNA synthesis following a standard cDNA synthesis protocol as below (see Table of Materials).\nMix 0.75 µM oligo dT primer, 4.3 µM random primer, dNTPs (10 mM each) with 200-500 ng total RNA (from steps 5-8) in 10 µL of total reaction volume.

Mix gently and incubate the reaction mix at 30 °C for 10 min, then at 42 °C for 60 min, and finally at 95 °C for 5 min to inactivate the enzyme. Cool the tubes on ice.\nNOTE: Thaw RNA samples and all the reagents on ice and prepare the reaction mix on ice. If target RNAs are only polyA RNAs, use oligo dT primer only (2.5 µM). Pause the protocol if needed. Store synthesized cDNA at -20 °C.",
    "Perform qRT-PCR in technical triplicates (n=3, Cт standard deviation > 0.2) and within biological replicates (n ≥ 3) using 1 µL of 10 ng cDNA, 0.4 µL of reverse primer (10 µM), 0.4 µL of forward primer (10 µM), 10 µL of mixture solution of DNA polymerase, 0.4 µL of double-strand DNA staining dye, 10 µL of nuclease-free water (reaction volume was 20 µL) to detect PCR products using following conditions; hold stage (1 cycle) for 30 s at 95 °C, cycling stage (40 cycles) for 5 s at 95 °C and for 30 s at 60 °C, melt curve stage.
