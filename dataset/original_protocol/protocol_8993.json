    "Wire the bipolar stepper motors by screwing the wires into the connectors supplied with the driver board. Wire colors on bipolar stepper motors are standardized (Figure 1).\n\tNote: The described stepper motors have a resolution of 1.8°/step, geared to 0.346°/step. A standard stereotax has 3 mm/360° of travel. The final resolution is 2.88 μm/step. The motors are also capable of fractional stepping.\n\t\nConnect the green wire to A+, connect the black wire to A-, connect the red wire to B+ and connect the blue wire to B-.\nSlide the couplers over the stepper motors, being careful to align the mounting holes, and secure them using 12x M3 Socket Head Screws (20 mm) (Figure 2).\n\t\nEnsure that the couplers are firmly attached to the motors.\n\t\tNote: The 3D models do not include threads. The parts are labeled with thread size, but they must be tapped after they are manufactured.\nRemove the set screws from the thumb grips on all 3 axes of the stereotaxic instrument using a small hex key. The thumb grips are threaded, so turn them counter-clockwise for removal. Keep the PTFE washers in place on the arm (Figure 3).\nScrew the threaded end of the collars onto the threaded rods of the stereotaxic instrument's arms (Figure 3).\n\t\nEnsure there is no gap between the collars and PTFE O-rings. This guarantees that coordinates are maintained when the robot changes directions.\nSecure the collars onto the threads of the stereotaxic arms using 3x NF10-32 (1/4 inch) cup point set screws.\nSlide each motor and coupler over the collars & stereotaxic arms. Ensure that the motors sit flush with the arms, and the set screw holes on the collars line up with the flat portion of the motor shafts (Figure 4).",
    "Secure the couplers to the stereotax using the mounting holes and 6x NF10-32 (1/2 inch) cup point set screws (Figure 4).\nSecure the collars to the motor shafts using 3x NF10-32 (1/4 inch) set screws (Figure 4).\nPrepare the CNC driver board by setting each of the controller pins to half stepping.\n\tNote: This stepper motor driver comes as an exposed circuit board. A case may be built, although it is not necessary. Also, a number of different bipolar stepper motor drivers may be used. If so, ensure that the setup instructions are followed for the specific board purchased.\n\t\nAlign all 6 pins per stepper motor in the same way. Half-stepping allows for double the step resolution in Degrees/step (Figure 5).\nFlip pin 1 to the on position, pin 2 to the off position, pin 3 to the on position, pin 4 to the off position, pin 5 to the on position, and pin 6 to the off position (Figure 5).\nPlug the motors (X - Y - Z) into the stepper motor driver, along with the 12 V power supply. The correct placement is marked on the driver. Also, attach the stepper driver to a computer's serial port using a DB25cable (Figure 6).\nInstall CNC milling software onto a personal computer (this will need to be located in a surgical area) following the default instructions. Once installed, open the software to begin configuration.\n\t\nConfigure the software to communicate with the stepper motors.\n\t\tNote: The following instructions are intended for use only with the TB6560 stepper motor driver.\nClick through the software's menus as follows. Open →Config→ Ports and Pins→Output Signals. Fill in the prompt to match Figure 7 and hit apply.",
    "Click through the software's menus as follows. Open→Config→Ports and Pins→Input Signals. Fill in the prompt to match Figure 8 and hit apply.\nClick through the software's menus as follows. Open→Config→Ports and Pins→Motor Outputs. Fill in the prompt to match Figure 9 and hit apply.\nClick through the software's menus as follows. Open→Config→Motor tuning. Fill in the prompt to match Figure 10 and click Save Axis Settings. Repeat the previous step for all 3 axes using the same values.\nCalibrate the stereotax to the scale of the CNC software.\n\tNote: The software is designed for standard milling machines, so its unit of measure will not be proportional to the travel of a stereotaxic instrument.\n\t\nSet the motors' velocity to 1 inch per minute, and \"jog\" the stereotaxic instrument's Z-axis with PgUp/PgDn to the nearest millimeter.\n\t\tNote: The maximum recommended jogging speed is 3,500 µm/sec and the maximum recommended cutting speed is 500 µm/sec.\nZero the Z-axis, and Jog the stereotaxic instrument 1 mm. The distance traveled on the Z-axis in Mach3 is the \"Scaling Constant\". Machine coordinates are determined by multiplying skull coordinates (mm) by the \"Scaling Constant\".\nPerform random tests of all 3 axes by programming them to travel some known distances, and ensure the movements are accurate. If the stereotax travel is too far or short, modify the scaling constant accordingly.\n\t\tNote: Once scaling is complete, the included custom scripts may be used to generate g-code for surgeries. However, it is highly recommended that users become familiar with g-code before attempting to auto-generate surgeries. This is imperative for troubleshooting and modifying automated surgeries.\nAttach the micro motor drill to the stereotaxic instrument using the extra large probe holder. Note: The minimum recommended drill bit speed is 40,000 rpm.",
    "Auto-generate G-Code for a sharp edge craniotomy with 3 skull screw holes.\n\t\nPlace all of the custom scripts from the software table into a single folder on a PC.\nOpen the script \"SharpEdgeCraniotomy.m\"and run the code.\nSelect Both to the prompt \"What Type of Surgery Will You be Performing?\" (Figure 11).\nSelect Custom, to define the corners of the skull window. Fill in each prompt to match Figure 12.\nDefine the X and Y positions of the craniotomy corners. Each coordinate must be entered in correct order, according the example in Figure 13.\nEnter 3 in the prompt to produce 3 skull holes (Figure 14).\nSelect Define Using Coordinates, and enter the coordinates of each hole from the template in Figure 15.\n\t\tNote: If precise coordinates are not important, there is an option to point and click the holes' positions onto an image of a rat skull. Positions will be automatically generated.\nDefine the drilling parameters. For the first tests surgery, accept the default values.\n\t\tNote: These values are dependent on the stepper motors, and the animal's skull. Every rat breed and target location has a slightly different skull thickness. For the initial few surgeries using this device, be prepared to test the drilling depths and remove any remaining skull pieces manually. The values can then be modified for future surgeries (Figure 16).\nName the g-code; it will be automatically generated and saved to the working directory.\nLoad the g-code into the CNC milling software and a test skull into the stereotaxic instruments ear bars.\n\t\nManually jog the drill bit to Bregma using the arrow keys. Use a slow jog speed (~5 inch/m) to ensure accuracy.\nStart the drill bit rotating at greater than 38,000 rpm.",
    "Press CycleStart; the stereotax will perform many passes of the same cut, at different depths. Between each pass, the stereotax will pause, so the surgeon may continue or abort cutting. Press Continue Cycle (Alt-R) to continue cutting passes.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
