    "All animals received humane care and all studies we carried out in accordance with policies and guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. All procedures were carried out under Animal Use Protocols that were approved by the University Health Network Institutional Animal Care Committee.\nNote: A schematic overview of the study protocol is presented in Figure 1.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53765/53765fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Study protocol. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53765/53765fig1large.jpg]\n1. Animals\nUse male Yorkshire pigs (30 kg) in this protocol.\n2. Kidney Graft Retrieval\nPreoperative Procedure\n\t\nHouse the male Yorkshire pigs in a research facility for at least one week to acclimatize them. Use intramuscular injection of a third-generation cephalosporin, such as ceftiofur, for 3 days to reduce the potential risk of infections with Streptococcus suis and Salmonella. Fast the pigs for a minimum of 6 hr before induction of anesthesia to prevent aspiration.\nInitiate anesthetization of the pig by an intramuscular injection of ketamine (20 mg/kg), atropine (0.04 mg/kg), and midazolam (0.3 mg/kg). Subsequently, transport the animal from the housing facility to the operating room (OR).\nPlace the pig in a supine position on the OR table. Allow the pig to breathe 2 L of oxygen with 5% of isoflurane spontaneously. Expose the vocal cords with a laryngoscope and spray them with 2% lidocaine topical solution to prevent intubation-induced laryngospasm. After intubation with a 6.5 mm tube, block the cuff with 3-5 ml of air.\n\t\tNote: Capnometry confirms the correct position of the tracheal tube.",
    "Decrease the isoflurane gas to 2.5%. Set the ventilator to 14-16 breaths/min and the tidal volume to 10-15 ml/kg body weight. Monitor the pig closely. Heart rate and oxygen saturation are recorded by pulse oxymetry. Confirm proper anesthetization by reduced heart rate (below 150 beats/min) and blood pressure (below systolic values of 100 mmHg) as well as absence of porcine movements (no usage of muscle relaxants).\nUnder sterile conditions, introduce an 9.5 Fr. single lumen permanent catheter into the internal jugular vein using Seldinger technique 27. Briefly, use a needle to puncture the vein. After introducing the guide-wire, replace the needle with the peel-away introducer, followed by replacement of the wire with the vascular catheter. Fix the catheter to the skin using a 3-0 silk or non—absorbable monofilament suture.\n\t\t\nAdminister 500 mg of metronidazole, 1 g of cefazolin, and 20 mg of pantoprazole. Administer 200 ml of lactated Ringer's solution with 5% dextrose (D5W) and 1 ml of fentanyl citrate per hour intravenously throughout the surgery. Apply veterinary ophthalmic ointment on eyes to prevent dryness while under anesthesia.\nSurgical Procedure\n\t\nFollowing sterile disinfection and coverage of the surgical field, perform a midline incision of 25 cm in length. Insert a retractor. Cover large and small bowels with a towel and position them to the left side for optimal access to the right kidney.\nFree the ureter and the right kidney itself from any adherent tissue using the cautery.\nDissect the right renal vein and artery using the cautery until their origin from the inferior vena cava and the aorta, respectively, are free. To avoid arterial vasospasm, administration of 30-65 mg of papaverine should be considered.\nAfter complete renal dissection, tie (silk, 3-0) and cut the ureter distally. Prepare a bowl of ice and a sterile organ bag.",
    "First, clamp the renal artery close to the aorta and second, clamp the renal vein close to the vena cava using vessel clamps. Next, resect the kidney graft and immediately cannulate the renal artery with a renal artery cannula. Use 500 ml of ice-cold histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution to flush out the blood. Store the kidney on ice until transplantation.\nIn situ, close the remaining renal artery with a ligature (silk, 2-0) and the renal vein with a running suture (prolene, 6-0).\nAfter checking the dissected area for bleeding, close the abdominal wall with a running suture (monofil, 1) and the skin with a 3-0 silk or non—absorbable monofilament suture..\nPostoperative Procedure\n\t\nFix the venous catheter subcutaneously with a suture (silk, 3-0) and tunnel it to the pig's back to prevent unwanted manipulation. After placing the pig prone, suture (silk, 3-0) the catheter firmly to the skin.\nWean the pig from the ventilator and let it recover in its housing area after extubation. Administer Ringer's lactate intravenously for volume expansion and administer 0.3 mg buprenorphine for analgesia. Do not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency.\n3. Kidney Graft Transplantation\nPreoperative Procedure\n\t\nAnesthetize the pig using intravenous injection of propofol (1-2 mg/kg body weight) followed by a continuous infusion of propofol at a rate of 50-100 mg/hr. Re-intubate the pig as described in step 2.1.3 and 2.1.4 and set the isoflurane gas to 3-4%.\nAdminister 1 g of cefazolin and 20 mg of pantoprazole i.v. During surgery, use the same anesthetic protocol as described in 2.1.4.",
    "Following sterile disinfection, make a cut of 4 cm next to the trachea. Dissect the tissue to expose the carotid artery. Pass over-holt forceps and a silk tie (2-0) around the artery. Use the Seldinger technique to introduce a plastic catheter to continuously measure the arterial pressure throughout the surgery. Alternatively, non-invasive blood pressure measurement techniques can be utilized.\nSurgical Procedure\n\t\nAfter sterile disinfection, reopen the abdominal cavity by cutting the stitches of the skin and fascia sutures, reintroduce the surgical retractor to expose the abdominal cavity, and reposition the bowel to the left side to allow better access to the infrarenal vessels.\nTransplant the preserved kidney graft end-to-side to the infrarenal vena cava and aorta. Therefore, dissect vena cava and aorta over 5-8 cm above the iliac bifurcation using pickups and cautery. If possible, do not disturb the lymphatic vessels; if not possible, close them with 5-0 prolene sutures.\nAfter completing the dissection, check for bleeding and remove remaining tissue from the vessels. Ensure that complete clamping of the vena cava and aorta with a Satinsky clamp is feasible.\nNext, resect the contralateral (left) kidney. To do so, position the bowel to the right; dissect the ureter, the kidney itself, the renal vein, and the renal artery from adherent tissue. Tie the ureter and blood vessels and resect the kidney. Check for bleeding.\nReposition the bowel to the left to expose the infrarenal aorta and vena cava. Inject heparin (100 IU/ kg body weight) and wait for at least 2 min.\nVenous Anastomosis:\n\t\t\nUse a Satinsky clamp to completely clamp the vena cava and make a slit incision that matches the size of the opening of the renal vein, using an 11 blade. Pott scissors can be used to further extend the slit.",
    "After wrapping the kidney into a cloth containing sterile ice, remove it from the ice and position it into the surgical field. Use two double-armed 6-0 prolene sutures to perform a cranial and a caudal corner stitch.\nApproximate the kidney, tie the upper corner and perform a running suture using 6-0 prolene, starting with the back wall. After having finished 2/3, use the other end of the tie to complete the suture at the front side. After tying the cranial stitches, tie the stitches at the caudal corner.\nPosition a bulldog clamp on the renal vein and open the Satinsky clamp. Check the anastomosis for bleeding.\nArterial Anastomosis:\n\t\t\nUse the Satinsky clamp again to completely clamp the aorta. Use an 11 blade to make a slit incision, matching the opening of the renal artery. Use a 4.0 mm round punch to secure a clean opening.\nUse one 6-0 prolene suture to perform the arterial anastomosis, starting at the recipient side. Ensure that the arterial endothelium is included in each suture to prevent a dissection. Meanwhile, start a continuous drip of 10 ml norepinephrine (16 mg/250 ml) diluted in 500 ml of Ringer's lactate and titrate to keep the systolic pressure above 100 mmHg.\nInject verapamil intra-arterially before completion of the arterial anastomosis and administer papaverine topically to the outside of the vessel to prevent vasospasm.\nPosition a bulldog clamp on the renal artery and open the Satinksy clamp. Check the anastomoses for bleeding.\nUnwrap the kidney from the cloth and remove the ice. Open the venous bulldog clamp first, followed by the arterial bulldog clamp. After reperfusion, urine production should start immediately.\nUse cloth to secure a favorable position for the transplanted graft and maintain a homogenous reperfusion.\nUreteral Anastomosis:",
    "Use Pott scissors to open the ureter from the graft and the recipient over a longitudinal length of 0.5 cm.\nUse two 6.0 polyester, poly (p-dioxanone) sutures for the side-to-side ureteral anastomosis. Perform a corner stich at each side, then run the back wall in a continuous manner first, followed by the front wall.\nAfter checking for bleeding, remove the cloth and wrap some of the small bowel around the kidney to hold it in position. Close the abdominal wall with two monofil 1 sutures. Close the skin with 3-0 silk or non—absorbable monofilament suture.\nMaintain the systolic pressure above 100 mmHg continuously by carefully titrating the norepinephrine infusion until the pig has been placed into prone position.\nPostoperative Procedure\n\t\nAfter abdominal closure as mentioned above, keep the pig warm using a heating pad and heat-circulating blanket. Remove the arterial line, close the puncture hole in the artery with a 6-0 prolene stich and close the incision site.\nTurn the pig onto prone position, stop the norepinephrine drip and wean the pig from the ventilator. Allow the pig to recover in its housing area and monitor it closely to ensure its smooth recovery from the procedure. Take blood gas samples each hr via the implanted jugular catheter. Provide Ringer's lactate to substitute volume and administer 0.3 mg buprenorphine for analgesia.\nFollowing extubation, monitor the pig closely until it is able to drink spontaneously. Do not leave an animal unattended until it has regained sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency. Do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\n4. Postsurgical Follow Up",
    "Administer 0.3 mg buprenorphine i.v. every 8 hr for at least 2 days post surgery or longer if needed. Routinely administer a single prophylactic dose of antibiotic during surgery. In the event of signs of infection, administer cefazolin 1 g i.v. twice per day and metronidazole i.v. once per day until clinical improvement occurs. Administer Ringer's lactate until the pig drinks sufficient water. 1,000 IU heparin can be used to lock the catheter to prevent clotting.\nCollect venous blood samples via the jugular catheter and urinary samples to assess the pig's clinical condition and renal function.\nFor euthanasia, induce anesthesia of the pig with propofol i.v. (5-10 ml) and maintain it with isoflurane 5%. Intubate the pig as described above. After relaparatomy and renal tissue sample collection, induce cardiac arrest by intravenous injection of 40 mval KCl."
