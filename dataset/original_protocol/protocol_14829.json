    "Animal work conducted at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center was performed in accordance with the NIH Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare guidelines and under institutional animal care and use committee protocol #EP080716. Tissues from hunter-harvested animals were gifts from the Wisconsin or Michigan Departments of Natural Resources.\n1. Solution Preparation\nNOTE: The solutions listed below are required for preparation of the CER assay substrate in Section 2 below. Prepare each of these solutions from higher concentration stock solutions; recommended concentrations for stock solutions will be given in parentheses after each respective chemical name listed. Prepare all solutions fresh upon substrate preparation and store at 4 °C until used.\nFor lysis buffer, prepare a solution of the following in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5 (1 M Tris, pH 7.5 stock solution recommended): 100 mM sodium chloride (NaCl, 1 M stock solution), 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA, 500 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 stock solution), 0.5% NP-40 (10% stock solution), 0.5% deoxycholate (DOC, 10% stock solution).\nFor conversion buffer, prepare a solution of 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, 10% stock solution) and 0.5% Triton X-100 (10% stock solution) in 1 phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 10, pH 7.4 stock solution).\nFor chaotropic solutions, prepare two 3 M solutions of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl, 8 M stock) in 1x PBS (10x stock solution). Adjust the pH of one of the solutions to 3.5 ± 0.05 using concentrated hydrochloric acid (HCl). Check that the pH of the second solution remains at pH 7.4 ± 0.05 and adjust using concentrated HCl or sodium hydroxide (NaOH) if necessary.\n2. Prepare CER Assay Substrate Pairs",
    "Obtain healthy, non-TSE-infected brain tissue from species of interest and prepare a 10% weight-per-volume (w/v) homogenate in lysis buffer using any of the following methods: dounce, bead-mill, or mortar and pestle homogenization. Further refine resulting homogenates by subjecting them to syringe-and-needle homogenization, using needles of increasing gauge until substrate can be aspirated and expelled with ease through a 27 G syringe needle.\n\t\nFor substrates prepared from rodents and other small mammals, homogenize whole brain(s); for substrates prepared from larger mammals, use obex (brainstem) tissue to prepare homogenates. When selecting the quantity of brain homogenate, prepare no more than 50% of the capacity of the centrifuge used for protein precipitation in step 2.6.\nIf the quality of acquired brain tissue is questionable, assess PrPC levels by SDS-PAGE16 and immunoblot17 prior to substrate preparation.\nDivide brain homogenate into two equal volumes in separate labelled plastic conical tubes. Add GdnHCl (3 M solutions in 1 PBS) at either pH 3.5 or 7.4 to each tube in a 1:1 volume ratio to brain homogenate.\nCheck the pH values of the two solutions. Adjust the pH of the pH 3.5 substrate to pH ± 0.05 using concentrated HCl. Ensure the pH of the other substrate remains at pH 7.4 ± 0.05 and adjust pH if necessary with HCl or NaOH as needed. Avoid overshooting pH values by judicious addition of acid or base.\nRotate solutions on an end-over-end mixer at room temperature (RT) for 5 hr.\nPrecipitate protein by adding four volumes of methanol to the substrate solutions in each conical tube, vortex to mix well, and incubate at -20 °C for 16-18 hr.",
    "Sediment samples by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Carefully decant and discard the supernatants and allow methanol to evaporate from the pellets. Use cotton-tipped applicators to assist in absorbing methanol clung to the inside of the tube. Do not allow pellets to over-dry and once methanol is no longer visible, proceed to the next step.\nResuspend protein pellets in conversion buffer. Use a quantity of conversion buffer equal to the amount of brain homogenate starting material dispensed into each tube in step 2.2.\n\tNOTE: It is critical that the conversion buffer used to resuspend protein pellets from both pH 3.5 and 7.4-treated substrate preparations is the solution defined in step 1.2 above (which contains low levels of detergents and a physiological pH).\nBriefly sonicate substrate solutions in a cuphorn sonicator (10 sec at ~30% maximal power), aliquot into 0.5 - 1.0 ml volumes in labeled 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes. Perform a quality control immunoblot (step 2.9) on an aliquot of each substrate. Store other aliquots at -80 °C until ready to perform CER assay (Section 4).\nPerform quality control on CER substrate pairs prior to use (Figure 2). These steps ensure that CER substrates will provide optimal results in conversion studies.\n\t\nEnsure comparable amounts of PrPC in the two substrates. Compare PrP levels in 10-25 µl of each substrate by SDS-PAGE16 and immunoblotting17. If protein levels in the pH 7.4 and 3.5 substrates are within ~10% of each other, the substrate pairs are appropriate for use in CER studies.\n\t\tNOTE: The PrP immunoblots should not show evidence of extensive PrPC degradation. The PrP immunoreactivity should be mainly >20 kDa. Bands less than this molecular mass can be degradation products. Banding patterns should be roughly equivalent between substrate pairs.",
    "As the PrPC in both substrates should be PK sensitive, treat 10-25 µl of each substrate with PK at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml and digest samples at 1,000 rpm at 37 °C for 1 hr in the thermo-shaker. Assess any remaining PrP signal by SDS-PAGE16 and immunoblotting17. Substrates with PrPres are not appropriate for use in CER studies.\n3. Prepare TSE Agent Seeds\nObtain TSE-infected brain tissue from species of interest and prepare a 10% (w/v) homogenate in 1x PBS pH 7.4 using the methods listed in step 2.1 above.\n\tNOTE: Seeds could also be produced from other TSE-infected tissues outside the central nervous system, however, efficiency of conversion of brain derived substrates by seeds derived from TSE-infected peripheral tissues has not yet been experimentally assessed in the published literature.\nAliquot resulting homogenate(s) into 100 - 300 µl volumes in 0.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and store at -80 °C until ready to perform the CER assay.\n4. CER Assay\nNOTE: The CER assay involves addition of a relatively small amount of PrPTSE (provided in the “seed”) from one species into a relative excess of PrPC (provided in the uninfected brain “substrate”) from another species that has been partially denatured at either pH 3.5 or 7.4. Following an extended shaking incubation period, template-driven conversion of PrPC by PrPTSE in each reaction is assessed by the densitometric signal of PrPres remaining after PK digestion and immunoblot detection. Comparing PrPres levels in the substrates previously denatured at pH 3.5 vs. 7.4 provides a measure of the species barrier. An experimental overview of this assay procedure is provided in Figure 1.",
    "Slowly thaw uninfected CER substrate pairs (assay requires equal volumes of substrates previously denatured at both pH 3.5 and 7.4) and TSE-infected seed solutions by placing them on top of a bed of ice (approximately 1 hr thaw time).\nOnce fully thawed, aspirate and then expel each substrate solution through a 27 G syringe needle several times to re-homogenize it. Briefly sonicate each TSE-infected seed solution for 10 sec at ~30% maximal power. Keep all solutions on ice while preparing conversion reactions.\nLabel 5 individual low binding, thin-walled PCR tubes per TSE agent being tested.\nPrepare conversion reactions in these tubes by adding 5 μl of 10% TSE-infected seed solution to 95 μl of (a) CER substrate prepared at pH 7.4 and (b) CER substrate prepared at pH 3.5.\n\t\nFor each experimental sample, prepare parallel reactions in CER substrate pairs previously denatured at both pH 3.5 and 7.4.\nOptimize ratios of TSE agent seed to uninfected brain substrate through empirical determination. Common seed:substrate ratios employed maintain a total reaction volume of 100 μl and include 1:99 μl, 2:98 μl and 5:95 μl. For most applications, the 5:95 μl seed:substrate volume ratio is appropriate and is what is presented in this protocol.\nPrepare three control samples per TSE agent being tested as follows: (a) add 5 µl of 10% TSE-infected seed solution to 95 µl conversion buffer as a control for input PrPres; add 5 µl conversion buffer to 95 µl substrate prepared at (b) pH 3.5 and (c) pH 7.4 as controls for non-specific, non-templated conversion.\nBriefly vortex each sample in its closed PCR tube to mix seed and substrate well. Follow with a momentary pulse in a low-speed bench top mini-centrifuge to remove any volume of the reaction mixture trapped in the PCR tube lid.",
    "Load samples in individually-labeled PCR tubes into a bench top thermo-shaker equipped to accept PCR tubes. Shake samples at 1,000 rpm at 37 °C for 24 hr.\nFollowing shaking, add sarkosyl to a final concentration of 2% (w/v) and PK to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Digest samples at 1,000 rpm at 37 °C for 1 hr in the thermo-shaker.\n\tNOTE: Addition of sarkosyl to samples post-conversion aids in PK digestion of PrPC. False positive signals in unseeded samples (Step 4.5) are virtually eliminated by addition of sarkosyl.\nAdd SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heat samples to 95°C for 5 minutes and resolve remaining PrPres in each sample by SDS-PAGE16 followed by immunoblotting17.\n\tNOTE: After addition of sample buffer and heating, samples may be immediately processed or samples can be stored at -20 °C or -80 °C prior to immunoblotting. All data presented here were generated using the Novex NuPAGE gel and transfer systems. Individual samples from the CER assay were treated with sample buffer and reducing agent according to manufacturer’s instructions. Samples were subsequently heated at 95 °C for 5 min and 30 µl of each sample was loaded into a 12% bis-tris precast gels.\nCalculate the conversion efficiency ratio (CER) as a measure of species barrier. Measure levels of PrPres by densitometry17 and divide the total density of the pH 7.4 sample by that of the pH 3.5 sample. Multiply by 100 to produce a percentage.\nCompile data from independent experimental replicates to generate a mean CER ± standard deviation for a species with a given TSE agent.\nSubscription Required.
