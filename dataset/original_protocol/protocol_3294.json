    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nAssembly and purification of polyubiquitin chains with a Cy3 fluorophore at the first ubiquitin\nTiming: 2–3 h\nThis major step describes the synthesis of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains with Cy3 conjugated to the most proximal ubiquitin in the chain (Cy3Ub-Ubn). The proximal ubiquitin is the ubiquitin closest to the substrate and in case of unanchored chains has a free C-terminal glycine, while the distal ubiquitin extends away from the substrate and represents the last moiety added to a ubiquitin chain (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). For studies with Cdc48-UN, we aimed to generate chains that were heterogenous in length with about 2–6 ubiquitins. The C-terminal His-tag on Cy3Ub-His serves two purposes. Since this construct does not contain a C-terminal Gly-Gly, Cy3-labeled ubiquitin can only serve as an acceptor for chain elongation and be present at the most proximal position in synthesized chains. The His-tag is also used to purify Cy3Ub-Ubn chains from untagged Ubn chains and gp78RING-Ube2g2.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3062-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

Additions of unlabeled ubiquitin to Cy3Ub every 30 min led to a controlled elongation of the polyubiquitin chain. Gel samples were taken at the indicated time points of the ubiquitination reaction and following elution from Ni-NTA resin. Cy3-labeled chains were visualized by a scan for Cy3 fluorescence.\nCreate a mixture of 50 μM Cy3Ub-His, 100 μM Ub, 1 μM mE1 and 20 μM of the E2-E3 chimera, gp78RING-Ube2g2, in ubiquitination buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section).",
    "Note: Make sure to prepare ubiquitination buffer freshly each day and store at 4 °C to assure sufficiently reduced DTT.\nInitiate chain elongation by adding ATP from a 500 mM ATP stock to a final concentration of 10 mM and react at 37°C for 30 min. This constitutes the first round of chain elongation. troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nAdd unlabeled ubiquitin to 100 μM and react at 37°C for another 30 min.\nRepeat step 3 until the desired chain length has been reached as visualized on an SDS-PAGE gel.\nCritical: The E2-E3 chimera gp78RING-Ube2g2 is highly processive.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5] Gradually adding unlabeled ubiquitin to Cy3Ub-His ensures robust formation of chains with a tight length distribution (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). The amount of unlabeled Ub added at each elongation step and the total number of additions might need to be optimized. Ideal reaction conditions will depend on the ubiquitin preparations and the method by which their concentrations were determined.\nDilute the reaction with NiA buffer and pass over Ni-NTA resin to selectively capture His-tagged Cy3Ub-Ubn. Unlabeled Ubn chains and gp78RING-Ube2g2 will remain in the flow-through.\nChains are eluted with the addition of NiB buffer.\nNiB buffer is exchanged by repeated concentration and ten-fold dilution with GF buffer. This dilution step is done three times to ensure efficient buffer exchange.\nAssembly and purification of polyubiquitin chains with a Cy3 fluorophore at the second ubiquitin\nTiming: 3–4 h",
    "This major step describes the synthesis of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains with Cy3 conjugated to the ubiquitin positioned second in the chain, i.e., the first distal moiety that is directly attached via an isopeptide bond to the proximal ubiquitin (Ub-Cy3Ub-Ubn). For studies with Cdc48-Ufd1/Npl4, we aimed to generate heterogenous chains centered around Ub5 in length. The C-terminal His-tag on unlabeled MCM-Ub-His serves the same purpose as in the major step above. Only unlabeled Ub will be present at the most proximal position in a chain. Formation of Ub-Cy3Ub-Ubn, however, requires two steps. In this first step, limiting Cy3Ub is added to MCM-Ub-His to form Ub-Cy3Ub and small amounts of Ub-Cy3Ub-Cy3Ub. After a Ni-NTA purification step, Ub-Cy3Ub is mixed with unlabeled Ub to form Ub-Cy3Ub-Ubn.\nCreate a mixture of 50 μM Ub-His, 5 μM Cy3Ub, 1 μM E1 and 20 μM of the E2-E3 chimera, gp78RING-Ube2g2, in ubiquitination buffer.\nInitiate elongation by adding ATP to 10 mM. Ideally, the major products will be Ub-Cy3Ub and unreacted Ub-His. troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nCritical: The goal of this part of the protocol is to add limiting amounts of Cy3Ub to the ubiquitination reaction such that the major product is elongation of Ub-His by a single addition of Cy3-labeled ubiquitin (to form Ub-Cy3Ub). Conditions that lead to elongation of Ub-His by multiple additions of Cy3-labeled ubiquitin Cy3Ub (forming Ub-Cy3Ubn) should be avoided. Small-scale test reactions can be performed using different molar ratios of Ub-His to Cy3Ub to determine optimal ubiquitination reaction conditions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A), which can vary depending on how the concentrations of Cy3Ub and Ub-His samples were quantified.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3062-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Shown are the gel samples collected from ubiquitination reactions containing the indicated molar ratios of unlabeled Ub-His to UbCy3. Cy3-labeled chains were visualized by a scan for Cy3 florescence.\n(B) Elongation of Ub-Cy3Ub dimers with unlabeled ubiquitin. Shown are the gel samples at the indicated time points of the 90 min reaction with unlabeled ubiquitin added every 30 min. Cy3-labeled chains were visualized by a scan for Cy3 florescence.\nDilute the reaction with NiA buffer and pass over Ni-NTA resin to selectively capture Ub-Cy3Ub and unreacted Ub-His. Any Cy3Ubn and gp78RING-Ube2g2 will remain in the flow-through.\nUse a 3 kDa MWCO spin filter to repeatedly concentrate and dilute into NiA buffer.\nTo synthesize unlabeled chains on the Ub-Cy3Ub dimer, set up a ubiquitination reaction in the same way as the one to form Cy3Ub-Ubn above.\nNote: Again, unlabeled Ub should be slowly added in batches over time (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: The amount of ubiquitin within each addition and the total number of additions may need to be optimized.\nPass the reaction over Ni-NTA to selectively capture Ub-Cy3Ub-Ubn and elute chains with NiB buffer.\nNiB buffer is exchanged for GF buffer by repeated concentration and dilution.\nNote: Contaminating unlabeled Ub-Ubn will also be present following Ni-NTA elution.\nFRET-based assay of polyubiquitin engagement by Cdc48-Ufd1/Npl4\nTiming: 1 h",
    "This major section describes a FRET-based assay to monitor substrate engagement by Cdc48-UN that uses the Cy3-labeled polyubiquitin chains synthesized above. Initiation of substrate translocation by Cdc48-UN occurs through the ATP hydrolysis-independent insertion of the N-terminus of an unfolded ubiquitin moiety into the central pore of the Cdc48 ATPase.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] Cryo-EM structures of this initiation state revealed that the unfolded “initiator” ubiquitin was positioned proximal to two folded ubiquitin molecules bound to the Npl4 cofactor.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] Since no ubiquitins proximal to the engaged moiety were resolved in the structure, it was impossible to localize the initiator moiety within the length of the polyubiquitin chain, and we therefore sought to monitor pore insertion with a FRET-based assay for determining the positions of suitable initiator ubiquitins within a polyubiquitin chain. We synthesized Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains labeled with a Cy3 donor fluorophore on the N-terminus of the first or second ubiquitin using the protocol described above and purified Cdc48 hexamers containing Cy5 acceptor fluorophores attached near the bottom of the central channel in the D2 ATPase domain, where the N-terminus of the initiator ubiquitin is located after initiation and prior to the onset of ATP-dependent translocation. Upon mixing of Cy3-donor-labeled chains with C5-acceptor-labeled Cdc48 in the presence of the UN cofactor and the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog ATPγS, we only observed a high-FRET state when the donor label was present at the second ubiquitin moiety, which indicated that Cdc48-UN preferentially engages ubiquitins distal in a chain, preceded by at least one other ubiquitin on the proximal side.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] This FRET-based assay not only revealed important kinetic and mechanistic details of a ubiquitous AAA+ ATPase motor, but also highlighted the power of methods for the assembly polyubiquitin chains with site-specific modifications.",
    "Create a sample of 0.4 μM Cy3-labeled polyubiquitin chains (Cy3Ub-Ubn or Ub-Cy3Ub-Ubn) in assay buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment] section for assay buffer, which can be stored for several weeks at 4°C) supplemented with 1 mM ATPγS (ATPγS-containing assay buffer should be stored at 4°C and used within 1 day). This is the 2X polyubiquitin sample.\nCreate samples of 4 μM Cy5Cdc48 (labeled through AzF incorporated at position 602 of S. cerevisiae Cdc48, see ref. 1 for detailed labeling protocol) with and without 4 μM UN in assay buffer supplemented with 1 mg/mL BSA and 1 mM ATPγS. These are the 2X Cy5Cdc48 and Cy5Cdc48-UN samples.\nCreate mixtures consisting of 6 μL of the 2X polyubiquitin sample and 6 μL of the 2X Cy5Cdc48 or Cy5Cdc48-UN sample. Incubate at 30°C in a thermocycler. The final concentrations are 0.2 μM Cy3Ub-Ubn or Ub-Cy3Ub-Ubn, 2 μM Cy5Cdc48, 0 μM or 2 μM UN, and 0.5 mg/mL BSA.\nNote: Pore-insertion kinetics are rapid (∼3 s)ref. 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] and therefore incubation of the mixture at 30°C for a few minutes is sufficient.\nTransfer 10 μL of each mixture into wells of a 384-well black plate (Corning, Cat. No. CLS3820) pre-heated at 30°C and load into a microplate reader (BMG Labtech CLARIOstar Plus) equipped to measure fluorescence emission spectra of Cy3 and Cy5 following excitation at the absorbance maximum for Cy3.\nIncubate at 30°C and scan wells for fluorescence emission between 525 nm and 725 nm using an excitation wavelength of 480 nm troubleshooting 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].",
    "Critical: Since both Cy3Ub-Ubn and Ub-Cy3Ub-Ubn contain contaminating unlabeled polyubiquitin chains, pore-insertion experiments are performed with a 10-fold excess of Cy5Cdc48-UN to avoid any competition between labeled and unlabeled chains. However, these conditions lead to technical challenges due to some extent of direct Cy5-acceptor excitation when exciting the Cy3 donor, which is further exacerbated by the fact that Cdc48 homohexamers can be modified with multiple Cy5 fluorophores depending on the labeling conditions and efficiency. If there is excessive direct excitation of Cy5, the Cy5 emission peak will dominate the spectrum and, due to spectral overlap, introduce some background fluorescence in the region of the Cy3 emission peak as well. To minimize Cy5 fluorescence emission resulting from direct excitation, experiments should be performed with an Cy3-donor excitation wavelength of 480 nm or lower.\nPore insertion under these conditions is best quantified by the quenching of donor fluorescence at the emission maximum observed in the presence of both Cy5Cdc48 and UN (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3062-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The Cy5 acceptor fluorescence is not a reliable indicator of FRET, as the observed changes are usually small due to direct excitation of excess Cy5 fluorophores.
