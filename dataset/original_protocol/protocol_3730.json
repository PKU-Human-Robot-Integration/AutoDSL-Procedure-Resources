    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol is organized into three main sections (see below). Section 1 and 2 both take several weeks to complete, and Section 3 can be carried out in 2 days after the conclusion of Section 2. Buffers and BH3 peptides described above may be prepared prior to starting the experiment.\nSection 1: Leukemia transplantation to create AML PDX models\nSection 2: Generating acquired resistance to BH3 mimetics in AML PDX models\nSection 3: Dynamic BH3 profiling on BH3 mimetics resistant myeloblasts\nSection 1: Leukemia transplantation to create AML PDX models\nTiming: 4 Weeks\nMice were injected with human AML cells to create PDX models for experimentation and analysis.\nNote: If not using a primary patient sample, a large repository of viably frozen PDX cells can be obtained from cBioportal (Townsend et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]) (https://www.cbioportal.org[href=http://www.cbioportal.org]). The time between tumor transplantation and leukemia development varies depending on PDX model. We were generally able to detect disease burden as circulating myeloblasts after 3 weeks of engraftment using FACS analysis.\nObtain human leukemia cells from a bone marrow (BM) biopsy.\nSubject BM aspirate (BMA) of human patient to Ficoll-Paque gradient to isolate mononuclear cells.\nDilute the BMA 1:5 (1 mL BMA: 5 mL 20°C–22°C PBS), filter through a 70 μm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL Falcon tube, and layer the BMA onto the Ficoll.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 30 min at 20°C–22°C without the brake. Collect the white blood cells from the interphase layer and transfer to a new 50 mL Falcon tube.\nAdd 4°C PBS to a final volume of 50 mL and mix by inversion. Centrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C. Look for pellet; aspirate the supernatant.",
    "Resuspend the cells in 5 mL of 4°C PBS to a final volume of 30 mL. Count the cells.\nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C. Look for pellet; aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend mononuclear cells in 200 μL of 20°C–22°C PBS.\nPause Point: We used immunocompromised NSG mice without prior pre-conditioning. We acclimated mice for 5-7 days before serial transplantation.\nPlace the mice under a lamp light to briefly warm them so that tail veins become more visible. Sterilize the mouse’s tail with an alcohol wipe.\nInject 0.6–1.0 × 106 human leukemia cells in 200 μL of PBS intravenously (IV) (Passage 1).\nBleed mice weekly to evaluate circulating peripheral blast counts and the engraftment progress via flow cytometry.\nUsing a surgical lancet, puncture the facial submandibular vein and collect 20–50 μL of blood in a microtainer blood collection tube. Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]\nLyse the cells by adding a 1:10 ratio of blood:RBC lysis buffer (Qiagen). Incubate for 10 min in a 5 mL FACS tube at 20°C–22°C.\nWash the cells with 4 mL of PBS.\nCritical: RBC lysis is a critical step of this protocol, but it is important to limit the incubation period to no longer than 10 min with lysis buffer. Extended exposure to RBC lysis buffer may cause the lysis of desired (non-RBC) cell populations too.\nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C. Look for pellet; aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in FACS staining buffer and proceed for hCD45 antibody staining at 1:100 dilution.\nUsing FACS analysis, determine the percentage of human myeloblasts circulating in the blood by gating on SSClowhCD45dim cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/655-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Gating strategy for identification of circulating human myeloblasts in AML PDXs",
    "Representative flow cytometry plots for circulating human myeloblasts in the peripheral blood of NSG mice.\n(A) Healthy NSG mice (non-transplanted).\n(B) NSG mice at 3 weeks post leukemia engraftment.\n(C) NSG mice after leukemia progression.\nSacrifice the mice and harvest key organs once FACS analysis reveals >70% circulating human myeloblasts.\nEuthanize mice in CO2 chamber equipped with a CO2 delivery rate of 10%–30% of the chamber volume per min.\nExpose peritoneum to remove spleen and collect the pelvis, femur, and tibia bones from both legs. Remove excessive fat and muscle.\nProceed with tissue processing to prepare the spleen and bone marrow for serial passaging of the leukemia cells.\nFor the spleen: Place spleen onto 70 μm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL Falcon tube. Add 5 mL PBS, smash the spleen using the plunger from a 5 mL syringe, and add 20 mL PBS to prepare a single cell suspension.\nFor the bone marrow: Crush all bones in 1 mL of PBS using a mortar and pestle. Filter the bones through a 70 μm cell strainer on top of a 50 mL Falcon tube to prepare a single cell suspension.\nPerform RBC lysis: Resuspend the cells in RBC lysis buffer (Qiagen) for 5 min at 20°C–22°C. Wash the cells with 4 mL of PBS.\nTo prepare cells for leukemia transplantation, resuspend 0.6–1.0 × 106 spleen myeloblasts in 200 μL of PBS. Cells can also be viability frozen using freezing media at this stage for future transplantations.\nSection 2: Generating acquired resistance to BH3 mimetics in AML PDX models\nTiming: variable by PDX model and drug\nBegin continuous treatment of leukemia-bearing mice with BH3 mimetics until leukemia blasts relapse, indicating acquired drug resistance.",
    "Pause Point: Time to develop acquired resistance depends on PDX model and individual drug. For BH3 mimetics, we typically observed resistance developing between 45–120 days on treatment, denoted by >70% circulating peripheral blast counts or signs of disease progression in the mice.\nRepeat section 1 step 5 to perform leukemia transplantation with murine spleen cells (Passage 2).\nNote: We utilized splenic cells to perform serial transplantation because the spleens typically yielded a higher number of cells compared to the bone marrow.\nBleed the mice weekly with section 1 steps 6 and 7 to assess for circulating peripheral blasts.\nWhen FACS analysis reveals >5% circulating peripheral blasts, begin treatment with BH3 mimetics.\nTo administer venetoclax: Use an oral gavage feeding tube to administer 100 mg/kg, PO, 5 days per week.\nTo administer S6383845: Use a 281/2g needle to inject 40 mg/kg, IV, 2 days per week.\nContinue to bleed the mice weekly to assess for circulating peripheral blasts. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]\nWhen FACS analysis reveals >70% circulating peripheral blasts, sacrifice the mice and harvest bones and spleen following section 1 steps 8a-c.\nProceed to dynamic BH3 profiling. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]\nSection 3: Dynamic BH3 profiling (DBP) on BH3 mimetics resistant myeloblasts\nTiming: 2 Days\nPerform dynamic BH3 profiling (Montero et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) on cells with acquired resistance to BH3 mimetics to identify new or persistent drug vulnerabilities based on drug-induced mitochondrial priming (threshold to apoptosis).\nSeed myeloblasts harvested from the spleen and bone marrow samples in section 2 separately in a 24-well plate at a density of 1.0 × 106 cells per 1 mL of RPMI per well. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.7]",
    "Note: While we harvested both splenic and bone marrow cells for downstream molecular studies, we primarily utilized splenic cells for DBP. Bone marrow samples often did not yield enough cells to evaluate larger drug panels, though we performed DBP on them when possible.\nTreat with desired drug panel for 14–16 h at 37°C.\nCollect the cells for DBP in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and prepare for cell surface staining.\nCentrifuge at 600 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C. Look for pellet; aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend 1.0 × 106 cells in 100 μL of FACS staining buffer.\nIncubate with 1 μL Fc blocker in the dark at 4°C for 15 min.\nWash the cells with 1 mL of PBS.\nIn the meantime, prepare a cocktail of antibodies and Zombie Yellow Fixable Viability dye in 100 μL of FACS staining buffer, each at 1:100 dilution. Do this for anti-hCD45, anti-hCD33, anti-hCD34, and anti-hCD38.\nIncubate the stained cells in the dark 4°C for 30 min.\nCritical: Cell surface staining steps are time-sensitive. For this reason, always prepare a little more of the antibody cocktail than is required to avoid coming up short.\nWash the cells with 1 mL of PBS.\nProceed with DBP.\nObtain pre-made peptide plates from the “Before you begin: Prepare multiwell high-throughput BH3 peptide plates for DBP” step, or prepare peptide plates in real-time as directed above.\nIf using pre-made plates stored at −80°C, thaw the plates in a 26°C incubator for at least 30 min before use.\nCentrifuge the PBS-washed cells at 600 × g for 5 min at 20°C–22°C. Look for pellet; aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend cells at 5 × 104 cells per 15 μL MEB buffer. Transfer the 15 μL cell suspension to a 384W BH3 peptide plate.",
    "Mix the cells with the BH3 peptides by gently tapping all 4 sides of the plate. Visually inspect the plate to ensure that the cells are not stuck to the sides of the wells.\nIncubate the cells with BH3 peptides in a 26°C incubator for 60 min.\nCritical: Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) processes are time- and temperature-sensitive. Make sure to incubate cells at a constant temperature no longer than the time described.\nIn a chemical hood, add 10 μL of 4% paraformaldehyde to each well to fix the cells and terminate BH3 peptide exposure. Repeat mixing, and incubate for 15 min at 20°C–22°C.\nAdd 10 μL of N2 buffer to each well to neutralize the 4% paraformaldehyde and terminate cell fixation. Repeat mixing, and incubate for 10 min at 20°C–22°C.\nAdd 10 μL of pre-made CytoC staining buffer and antibody mixture to the wells. Repeat mixing, and incubate at 4°C overnight (14–16 h) in the dark.\nCritical: Mixing well is very important to ensure homogenous staining across each well. For the last step, thoroughly mix the cells and stain by covering the plate with an adhesive sealing film and shaking the plate from side to side.\nProceed with acquisition and FACS analysis.
