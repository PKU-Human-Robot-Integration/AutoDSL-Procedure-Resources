    "Ethics Statement: All patients enrolled in these studies were done so in accordance with approved institutional review board oversight at New York University School of Medicine.\n1. Patient Selection and Initial Preparation for Imaging\nNote: The following materials are required: 0.5% tropicamide ophthalmic solution, 2.5% phenylephrine ophthalmic solution, cSLO equipped with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), and internal fluorescence reference.\nPrior to imaging, appropriately set up cSLO for data acquisition according to manufacturer's instructions.\nMount an internal fluorescent reference in the cSLO. Note: The internal fluorescent reference, as purchased from the manufacturer, is housed in a metal ring and is placed directly behind the camera lens. If a cSLO from another manufacturer is used, there may be a different configuration than that which is described in this protocol.\n\t\nIn order to insert the reference into the cSLO, twist the lens to remove it, unscrew the machine's metal ring, and replace it with the new metal ring containing the reference.\n\t\tNote: the internal fluorescent reference is essential to the qAF technique, as it allows correction for variation in laser power and detector sensitivity/gain.\nHave patients recruited for imaging undergo a routine dilated eye examination and obtain background information regarding past ocular history and underlying medical conditions that may manifest with ocular findings.\nDilate pupils with 0.5% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine. CRITICAL STEP: Dilate pupils to at least 6 mm. Note: This is essential for uninterrupted passage of light, and thus for optimal visualization and measurement of the fundus.\nPrior to imaging, position the patient properly on the cSLO, with chin resting on the chinrest, forehead placed against the forehead rest, and lateral canthi properly aligned with the indicators.\n2. Baseline Imaging of the Ocular Fundus",
    "First, image the fundus with near infrared reflectance (IR) light (wavelength of 820 nm) in order to centralize the camera over the macula and obtain rough focus.\n\t\nWith patient properly positioned, switch the hardware setting on the control panel to IR imaging mode, position camera manually until the fundus is in full focus, and take an image\nAdjust the setting on the control panel to \"IR-OCT\", which uses spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in conjunction with IR imaging to evaluate the macula for underlying disease.\nUse the guides present in the imaging window to correctly orient the OCT to the IR image of the fundus. To achieve optimal SD-OCT quality, position the camera such that the OCT image is in the top third of its imaging window. Acquire at least one horizontal line scan through the fovea and spanning the entire imaging field.\n3. Setting up qAF Imaging\nUse \"High speed\" image acquisition. Note: This setting allows for faster image acquisition, which decreases risk of signal loss due to patient movement and resulting blockage of light by the iris or eyelids.\nUse \"Mean of 9\" frames. Note: This setting allows for the rapid, sequential capture of 9 image frames, which can be subsequently \"averaged\" to reduce noise and artifact (see below).\nUse \"30 x 30 degree\" field. Note: This refers to the degrees of retinal area captured during image acquisition.\nPrior to imaging, warn patient about the blue light, as this can be alarming at first.\nTurn on the AF mode and align camera axis such that the screen is maximally \"filled\" with fundus AF (minimal darkening of the sides and corners of the image).",
    "If patients have difficulty tolerating the bright blue light, start imaging with the camera further away from the eye and then bring the camera slowly toward the patient until the fundus is in full view.\n\t\tCRITICAL STEP: If light entering into or exiting from the eye is obstructed, decreased signal will result. Localized decrease is visible as asymmetric darkening of an image side or corner. Generalized loss of signal is seen when eye movements alone obstruct light passage.\nAlign the camera such that the AF signal is at its highest level throughout the field. Aim for maximal signal rather than sharpest image, however they roughly correlate. Adjust the camera focus by moving the cSLO to reposition the camera either manually or with the ophthalmoscope joystick.\nAdjust the sensitivity/gain such that fundus AF is easily visible, but avoid over-saturation. During image acquisition, colored pixels visible in either the internal reference (located at the top of the image) or the fundus indicate over-saturation and thus loss of signal.\n4. Image Acquisition\nNote: CRITICAL STEP: The goal in image acquisition should be to obtain 2 high quality 9-frame image stacks per session to control for variability between images within a session. After repositioning the patient and camera, obtain a second session of two images to assess and control for variability. All images will ultimately be calibrated to the internal reference (described below).\nAcquire images only after at least 20 sec of \"bleaching\" (full exposure of retina to AF light) to minimize absorption of light by rhodopsin in the sensory retina 9.\n\t\nUse this period to optimize camera alignment, focus and sensitivity.\nHave the subjects blink before each image acquisition as a fresh tear film improves signal quality.\nAvoid eyelids in the plane of acquisition.",
    "Note: It may be helpful to manually open eyelids for more challenging patients. The authors recommend that an assistant performs this task.\nOptimize alignment before each image acquisition to ensure that light is not obstructed by the iris resulting in decreased signal.\n\tNote: As at least minor movement is very common, the authors recommend fine realignment as necessary before each image acquisition. Guiding and encouraging the patient while imaging helps decrease movement. The authors also recommend using the machine's foot-pedal as the \"acquisition button\" so as to minimize operator distraction.\nPerform post-image processing by computing the \"mean\" of the 9-frame stack to increase signal-to-noise ratio. Calculate the mean of a stack using the cSLO software by selecting the option to calculate the mean.\n\tNote: There may be stacks where some frames are not of optimal quality (i.e., have localized or generalized decreased signal relative to the optimal frames), therefore carefully inspect each stack and deselect suboptimal frames before computation of the mean.\n\tNote: Mean images with acceptable signal-to-noise ratios can be processed from at least 3 frames. It is normal for the sides and corners of each image to have lower signal than the central 20 degrees due to limitations within the cSLO itself.\n\t\nIf the software asks whether the operator would like to normalize the gray levels (i.e., stretch the histogram) between 0 and 255, select \"No\". This maintains unaltered gray levels for analysis.\n5. Image Analysis\nAnalyze AF images as previously described using image analysis software developed for the qAF technique (IGOR; 9). A brief description of a typical image analysis using this software is included below.\n\t\nLoad the qAF program in IGOR and import images (in .bmp format) exported from the cSLO software with pixel aspect ratio 768 x 768 (default output parameter).",
    "Select the image in the drop-down menu and initiate analysis.\nReposition calibration indicators on the image such that the \"crosshairs\" overlie the fovea and the \"bracket\" abuts the optic disc (these indicators are used to scale and position the ROIs). When properly positioned, use software prompts then populate the image with circumferential ROIs surrounding the fovea (see Figures 1, 2).\nSelect the option in IGOR to calibrate the overall gray levels of each image to those levels present in the internal fluorescent reference. Note: This step allows for calibration of machine-related factors, including the electronic zero level of each image and the internal reference calibration factor of each machine, as well as patient-related factors, including age, refraction and corneal curvature.\n\t\tNote: The analysis software then displays the fixed regions on the resultant image and a qAF value is demonstrated within each region. qAF values are also automatically entered into a spreadsheet format in a separate window.\"\nGenerate qAF \"heat maps\" by selecting the option within the command prompts. All images and data can be exported from the IGOR software in an excel spreadsheet by selecting the appropriate options.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
