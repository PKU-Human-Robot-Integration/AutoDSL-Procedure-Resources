    "The following methodologies for the housing, care, and study of zebrafish have been approved by the Saint Joseph's University IACUC.\n1. Zebrafish Housing and Care\nObtain the subject zebrafish from a local supplier, or from wild-caught populations. Please note that housing the zebrafish is subject to IACUC guidelines and additional permits are required for housing wild-caught populations.\nIdentify and separate zebrafish according to sex. Alternatively, skip this step or replace with a different method of separation based on the study hypothesis.\n\tNOTE: Sex characteristics are difficult to determine in zebrafish, particularly in females. Refer to these guidelines10 or useful online manuals to distinguish sex.\nRandomly separate the populations further into the appropriate ratio of focal fish to stimulus fish. Note: Focal fish are the test subjects followed through the series of behavioral assays, and stimulus fish are the individuals that will occupy the stimulus chambers in the aggression and shoaling assays.\n\tNOTE: Traditionally, between 1 and 5 stimulus fish per focal fish in shoaling assays and a 1:1 stimulus:focal fish ratio in aggression assays14,17 are used. However, the researcher needs to specifically design the study with the hypothesis in mind (i.e., should stimulus fish be kept constant to maintain consistency in focal fish behavior, or should stimulus fish be rotated between each assay to ensure proper randomization).\nStore all fish in zebrafish housing racks (27.5-28.5 °C) under a strict 12:12 light/dark cycle. Feed all focal and stimulus fish flake food daily and brine shrimp weekly, on non-research days.\nBe sure that all testing is done between ZT1 and ZT5 (zeitgeber time) to avoid circadian rhythm effects26.\n2. Randomization and Tank Setup",
    "Randomize all individuals a priori to a specific sequence of behavioral assays. Set up a consistent randomization scheme using an online random sequence generator27 or a random sequence generator from a statistical software package (R).\n\t\nLabel each assay from 1 to 3 and keep this assignment consistent. Assign a random sequence to each individual and map the sequence according to the behavioral assay label. For example, for three total assays (1 mapped to Shoaling, 2 mapped to Boldness, and 3 mapped to Aggression), a given individual may have a randomized sequence of '2,3,1', which will require them to perform the specific behavioral assays in the specified sequence.\nSet up the assay tanks (boldness, aggression, and shoaling) in the laboratory in places that minimize the possibility for adverse external stimuli and be sure to have enough room for a video camcorder to capture the entire tank. Ensure that the camcorder has enough clarity to view tank labels as well as be able to distinguish subtle behaviors of the focal fish and setup the camcorder in this position.\nRecord all behavioral assays with the camera maintained in the same position with a full view of the specified tank to minimize unintended differences in behavioral scoring as a result of differential recordings.\n\tNOTE: Avoid placing tanks in heavy trafficked areas and by doors as movement and sound will affect zebrafish behavior.\nEstablish unique JWatcher protocols24 for scoring each behavioral assay. Refer to the JWatcher manual to learn how to create focal master files to assign behaviors to keystrokes and focal analysis files to summarize data collected.\n\tNOTE: JWatcher is behavioral scoring software that allows for reliable and repeatable customized behavioral scoring24.",
    "Define a labeling scheme to track the date, fish number, and assay number for all behavioral assays (e.g., 'F5-B-123115' implying Fish 5, Boldness assay, on December 31st, 2015) and label the outside of the tank with tape in view and in focus of the camera. Keep and record this information in a lab notebook for quick reference and future quality control.\nSet up an acclimation tank that will be used between all assays as well as directly after the individuals are removed from the housing rack.\n\tNOTE: The acclimation tanks and terminal tanks are small aquariums (40 cm x 20 cm x 25 cm) with gravel and a filter that closely resemble the housing rack.\nAfter the assays are all completed, transfer the individual into a separate terminal tank that will serve as the final destination tank for all used focal individuals. Use a tank that is large enough to house a group of individuals for the remainder of their lives (e.g., 25 gallon).\n\tNOTE: It is very important to maintain consistent and similar water temperatures and conditions across all tanks. This includes housing, acclimation, and all testing tanks.\n3. Conducting the Aggression Assay\nConduct the aggression assay in a 19 L rectangular tank measuring 30 cm x 15 cm x 10 cm. Outfit the tank in external opaque partitions surrounding three sides of the aggression tank, leaving the front exposed for viewing, to reduce undesirable outside stimuli. Divide the tank with external markings into four equal rectangular quadrants and fix a mirror permanently (with silicone caulk) within the lower left quadrant, inclined at 22.5° forming a right triangle against the far left side of the tank.",
    "Ensure that the temperature of the water in the acclimation tank and aggression tank is within 2 °C of the housing rack. To do so, have fresh, aged water pre-warmed to 27.5-28.5 °C ready to add to the aggression tank. Please note that it is important to change the water in between each assay to eliminate unwarranted olfactory cues.\nTransfer, by cupping, a focal fish from the housing rack to a separate acclimation tank where it will acclimate for 10 min.\n\tNOTE: It is important to reduce stimulus introduced to the fish through improper handling. Transfer individuals as previously described27.\n\t\nSpecifically, manually and carefully place a small, transparent plastic cup into the tank of interest. Without disrupting the fish as much as transferring by using a net, slowly scoop up the fish into the cup.\nEnsure that the video camcorder is ready to record by confirming that the aggression assay tank (see step 3.1) is in focus and immediately before transferring the individual into the aggression tank, press record on the device. Transfer focal fish via cupping from acclimation tank to aggression tank.\n\tNOTE: It is important to record prior to the fish entering the aggression tank to track the exact time of entry.\nRecord the aggression tank for 10 min and 30 sec and then cup the focal fish from the aggression tank back into the acclimation tank.\nWhen watching the recording, wait 30 sec after the fish has been introduced to the tank as an additional acclimation period before scoring behaviors.",
    "Using the JWatcher scoring system defined for aggressive behaviors, quantify the following behaviors for 10 min: Time spent near mirror, number of mirror approaches, number of darts, number of attempted bites (opening mouth in direction of mirror), and number of lateral displays (dorsal, pectoral, anal, and caudal fin erection)9.\nScore a single aggression assay at least twice, until the assay is scored with high agreement between iterations.\n4. Conducting the Boldness Assay\nConduct the boldness assay in a small 1.5 L trapezoidal tank, measuring 15 cm tall x 26.5 cm top x 22.5 cm bottom x 6 cm width. Wrap opaque paper around all sides of the tank but leave the front exposed for viewing. Place a single, thin piece of tape external to the tank to demarcate the top from the bottom portion of the tank.\nEnsure that the temperature of the water in the boldness tank is within 2 °C of the housing rack (see step 3.2)\nTransfer the focal fish from the housing rack to the acclimation tank (see step 3.3) and let acclimate for 10 min.\nEnsure that the camcorder is ready to record the boldness assay and, once ready to transfer the focal fish, press record on the device. Transfer the focal fish from the acclimation tank to the boldness tank and record for 8 min and 30 sec.\nWhen watching the recording, allow for an additional 30 sec acclimation period after the fish is introduced to the tank before scoring.\nUsing JWatcher software, quantify boldness behaviors for 8 min. Specifically, quantify the following behaviors: Time near surface, latency to enter upper portion, number of transitions into the upper portion, and number of erratic movements (darts)29.\nScore a single boldness assay at least twice, until the assay is scored with high agreement between iterations.",
    "5. Conducting the Shoaling Assay\nConduct the shoaling assay in a 76 L tank that has three compartments divided by two glass dividers sealed with silicone caulk (the resulting three compartments consist of two stimulus zones and one focal compartment). Externally, mark two preference zones designated 6.35 cm from each of the stimulus zones' glass divider, indicative of two body lengths30. Apply opaque partitions externally around three sides of the shoaling tank, but leave the front exposed for viewing.\n\tNOTE: This preference zone can be customized to test for specific hypotheses for different sized species.\nDepending on the nature of the study, select stimulus shoals to acclimate for at least 12 hr before testing and remain in the shoaling tank throughout the course of the experiment.\n\tNOTE: Stimulus shoals are collections of individual fish that are used to assess how the focal fish behaves in the presence or absence of these shoals. Different stimulus shoal combinations can be selected to test a number of diverse shoaling hypotheses. Be sure that the stimulus shoals are rotated between each stimulus zone to avoid side bias and are also allowed to acclimate for at least 12 hr before testing.\nTransfer the focal fish into the acclimation tank as previously described (see step 3.3)\nTransfer, by cupping, the focal fish from the intermediate acclimation tank to the central compartment in the shoaling tank.\nAllow for a 10 min acclimation period before a 10 min live-scoring observation period. Alternatively, record the shoaling assays and score later using JWatcher. Fish are determined to be shoaling when they are within the preference zone in the chamber housing the target shoal.\nQuantify time spent in each preference zone and time spent in the center volume.",
    "As an additional descriptive measure, calculate 'strength of shoaling' (SoS). Assign a value between -1 and +1 where the magnitude describes how often an individual fish shoals.\nCalculate the ratio of time spent shoaling divided by the area of the shoaling zones and subtract the ratio of time spent not shoaling and the area of the non-shoaling zones. Place this quantity over the sum of time spent in each zone divided by the volume of each zone individually. More information about this calculation can be found in a previous study14.\n6. Data Quality Control\nAnalyze data using traditional data analysis tools31-32.\nTest for homogeneity of variance using nonparametric Levene's test for all behaviors. If a behavior is non-homogeneous perform a log-transformation33.\nConfirm that there are no sequence effects (i.e., that the randomization order did not affect the individuals' behavior) using a Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA on the homogeneous data34.\nConfirm that there are no side biases for the shoaling assay by creating univariate general linear models on SoS indices with side as a fixed factor35.\n\tNOTE: If there are little to no issues with the data, downstream analyses can be conducted. If there are issues, reconcile with additional transformations, rationalize with biologically plausible explanations, and/or increase sample sizes.\n7. Analyze Data\nCalculate two-tailed Spearman rank correlations36 for all behaviors separately within the boldness and aggression assays.\nCalculate intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) as a two-way mixed model with consistency for behavioral assays that were conducted more than one time for a given individual36. In this setting, the ICC is a measurement of how consistently a fish behaved in a given assay measured more than one time.\nPreprocess boldness and aggression behaviors by centering and norming all behaviors to prepare for input to a principal components analysis (PCA)25.",
    "NOTE: Preprocessing the measurements by centering and norming is a vital step. Without this preprocessing step behaviors that occur with more frequency and more variably will excessively influence the interpretations of the extracted components. The process of centering and norming will remove this bias.\nPerform a PCA with a correlation matrix to determine if boldness and aggression are linked together as a behavioral syndrome. Interpret behavioral loadings of each component significant at >0.6. See Budaev 201024 for a comprehensive guide for reporting PCA for behavioral studies. A scree plot will be informative on which eigenvectors should be kept for interpretation.\nUsing statistical software package such as R or SPSS31,32, extract scores for each component for each individual. The scores represent how much the given individual's behavior can be explained by the particular component.\nCalculate Spearman rank correlations between factor regression scores and the strength of shoaling36.\n\tNOTE: A behavioral syndrome is considered present if boldness and aggression behaviors load on the same component or, if any component with significant interpretable loadings correlates with strength of shoaling. Also, note that strength of shoaling is not included in the PCA to allow for better interpretations of the more complex behavioral quantifications (boldness and aggression). The PCA will orthogonally collapse boldness and aggression features into eigenvectors to maximize the amount of variation explained and is well suited for these complex measurements. Interpreting the resulting eigenvectors and regressing our strength of shoaling measurements on each of them gives a much more intuitive interpretation of how each of the complex behaviors (boldness and aggression) relate to a more well-defined binary shoaling measurement (i.e., the fish is shoaling or not shoaling).\nSubscription Required.
