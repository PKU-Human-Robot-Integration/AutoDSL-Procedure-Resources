Stereotaxic intracranial injection of virus for induction of glioma.Transfection and viral packaging procedure (Figure 1A)Note: We follow the manufacturer provided protocol for Polyjet mediated transfection (http://signagen.com/DataSheet/SL100688.pdf[href=http://signagen.com/DataSheet/SL100688.pdf]). Day 1: Plating of 293T cellsPlate 293T cells (around 3-4 x 106) in poly-L-lysine coated 10 cm diameter dishes in DMEM with 10% FBS media (D10 culture media). Cells will become 70-80% confluent after 24 h. Note: Plan accordingly to allow 5-6 h next day for transfection and medium change.Day 2: Transfection dayPre-transfection checkCheck for confluence next day and use the plates with 70-80% cell confluence. Note: Higher confluence can be a hindrance as cells don’t have space to grow.1 h before transfection, change media with fresh D10 media–4 ml per plate.Use the following table for 10 cm plates for transfection (Table 1).Table 1. Transfection miximgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170713/20170713191049_0662.jpgTransfectionMix the calculated concentration of DNA in 500 µl DMEM without FBS and gently mix.Add 45 µl of Polyjet in 455 µl of serum free DMEM media and gently mix with pipette and immediately mix with diluted DNA of step A2b i. Gently mix them and incubate at room temperature for 10-15 min. Note: Not more than 20 min.Then add it into the plates drop wise and gently shake. Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5 h. Note: Do not keep longer as it can be toxic to the cells. Discard the transfecting media and add fresh D10 10 ml per plate and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h.Day 3: 1st collectionCollect the media and centrifuge at 600 x g (2,000 rpm) for 10 min and collect supernatant, leaving the cellular debris at the bottom.",
    "Collected media can be stored at 4 °C for 3 days at max (Tiscornia et al., 2006) before ultracentrifuge concentration.Add fresh D10 media 10 ml per plate and incubate again for next 24 h.Day 4: 2nd collectionCollect the media and centrifuge at 600 x g (2,000 rpm) for 10 min and collect the supernatant, leaving the cellular debris at the bottom.Pool the media from day 3 and day 4 and filter using 0.45 µm pore size filter.Ultracentrifugation for viral concentrationWe use Beckman Coulter rotor SW 32 Ti, which has capacity to hold six 38 ml open-end tubes. Balance the tubes to the maximum difference of 0.5 g and centrifuge at 68,300 x g (20,000 rpm) for 2 h at 4 °C. With each tube holding 30 ml, a total 360 ml of media can be centrifuged in one run. If required to run more media, discard the supernatant after 1st spin without disturbing the pellet add fresh media for 2nd run.Note: Do not use the tubes filled less than half of its capacity which increases the risk of collapse.Pour off the supernatant after the run and aspirate rest of the droplets from the wall without disturbing the pellet.Transfer the centrifuge tubes in to 50 ml screw capped tubes and keep them upright on shaker at 4 °C overnight and allow the residual media to re-suspend pellet (roughly around 20-30 μl/tube). Centrifuge briefly and collect the re-suspended pellets from all the tubes, aliquot the concentrate in 4-10 μl volumes and store at -80 °C for more than a month. Avoid repeated cycles of thawing and freezing that can drastically reduce the viral titer.For in vivo injection, further purification of virus by sucrose cushion is recommended (Tiscornia et al., 2006).",
    "Sucrose cushionCollect the viral concentrate after overnight shaking and wash the tube with 100 µl of HBSS and pool it with collected viral concentrate.Using round bottom 5 ml tubes, fill it with 1.5 ml of 20% sucrose in HBSS and add 200 μl of viral concentrate. The rotor used is SW 55 Ti and after balancing, spin at 48,600 x g (20,000 rpm) for 2 h at 4 °C. Pour off the supernatant and allow rest to drain off by inverting the tubes. Re-suspend the pellet in 50-100 μl of HBSS, cover with Parafilm and shake slowly for 20-30 min. Collect the concentrate, aliquot it and store at -80 °C.Check for the titer in a reporter cell line. We use mouse embryonal fibroblasts, which express tdTomato reporter upon Cre expression.Titration of retrovirusMEF (mouse embryonic fibroblasts) cells are isolated from E13.5-14.5 embryos of CAG-Rosa-tdTomato reporter mice (THE JACKSON LABORATORY) (Durkin et al., 2013) for retrovirus titering. These cells express tdTomato when exposed to Cre-expressing viruses and allowing us to assess the viral infectivity. For virus titration, we use the procedure described by Tiscornia et al. (2006).Coat the 24-well plate with 500 µl poly-L-lysine per well with incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, aspirate the media and wash with autoclaved deionized water and let it dry for 1-2 h in biosafety hood.Plate 105 MEF cells in 500 µl D10 media per well in 24-well plate. Use a minimum of 8 wells including one as negative control.Incubate it for 6 h and then check after 6 h if they adhere to the plate.Make 10-fold dilutions of retrovirus (undiluted to 106) in PBS with total volume around 50 µl.Change 480 µl D10 media with polybrene at a concentration of 4 µg/ml.",
    "Add 20 µl of each viral dilution to the well and mix gently and thoroughly. Incubate the cells at 37 °C for 48 h. TdTomato will be visible within 24-48 h. Assess the percentage of tdTomato positive cells by counting on Neubauer cell counting chamber or by using FACS and calculate the titer by using following formula: imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170713/20170713191533_4736.jpgViral titer ≥ 107/ml is adequate for tumor formation.Intracranial stereotaxic injection procedure (Figure 1B)Note: Neonatal or young adult mice can also be used with appropriate stereotaxic device adapter.  Pre-surgical preparationSwitch on the incubator or heating pad.Check the micro-drill, anesthesia machine for oxygen pressure and adequate isoflurane flow and overhead light source.Set up the stereotaxic instrument as per the instructions of the manufacturer.Switch on the anesthesia machine with attachment for mouse enclosure. Oxygen flow (0.8-1.5 L/min) and isoflurane (2-3%) are set for induction of anesthesia and decreased to 1-1.5% for maintenance. Alternatively, use ketamine and xylazine combination which is injected intra-peritoneal. Load the concentrated virus in syringe (e.g., 3 µl per each mouse to be injected) slowly avoiding bubbles and set it up on the holder in stereotaxic device. Apply artificial tear ointment on exposed cornea to avoid drying.Surgical procedureAnesthetize the mouse and check the anesthesia level by toe pinch.Set up the mice on stereotaxic device with nose and ear holders firmly to avoid any accessory movement of head during the procedure and isolate the surgical area with sterile drape or covers.Clean the operative area (back of the skull) using autoclaved cotton tips with chlorhexidine and isopropanol alternatively three times each. Wait for a few minutes.Make an incision on the back of head of about 1-1.5 cm in length to expose bregma.",
    "Adjust the stereotaxic device in relation to bregma as a reference and then use the coordinates depending on the age and area of brain to be targeted (e.g., for targeting the corpus callosum in adult mice, we used the coordinates: Anteroposterior + 0.2 mm, Lateral ± 0.5 mm and dorso-ventral 2.2 mm.Mark the targeted area with surgical site marker.Drill hole in bone using micro-drill being careful to avoid going too deep.Lower the syringe needle 0.4-0.6 mm deeper to the desired depth (e.g., here 2.2 + 0.6 mm), wait for 1-2 min and retract back to desired depth to form a small pocket and slowly inject 1 μl of viral concentrate, wait for 1-2 min, retract 1 mm and inject 1 μl again. We usually inject 1-3 μl of viral concentrate in one adult mouse. Slowly retract the needle to avoid leaking of the concentrate.After complete retraction, use tissue glue to join the tissue flaps.Give buprenorphine injection intra-peritoneal. (0.05-0.1 mg/kg)Keep the mouse on heating pad or incubator till it becomes conscious.Monitor the mice for next 2-3 days and administer analgesics as per the protocol.Wash the needle with 70% ethanol and three times with sterile water."
