    "1. Preparation of Proteins and DNA Substrates\nPurify S. pombe Rad51 and Swi5-Sfr1 proteins to homogeneity (judged by Coomassie staining), as previously reported13,21.\nPrepare oligonucleotide DNA substrates listed in Table 118.\n\tNOTE: The oligonucleotides were purchased (see Table of Materials) and synthesized at HPLC grade. For the DNA strand pairing reaction, oligonucleotides 16FA(-), 16A(-)_40bp and 16AR(+)_40bp are required. For the DNA displacement assay, oligonucleotides 16A(-), 16FA(-)_40bp and 16AR(+)_40bp are required (Figure 1 and Table 1). All DNA concentrations in this protocol refer to fragment concentrations as opposed to nucleotide concentrations.\nTo form donor dsDNA, mix equimolar amounts of complementary strands in a thin-walled PCR tube with annealing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2), ensuring a total volume greater than 20 µL. Perform this mixing on a prechilled metal rack on ice (between 2 °C and 4 °C).\n\tNOTE: The combination of oligonucleotides for the pairing assay are 16A(-)_40bp and 16AR(+)_40bp. For the displacement assay, anneal oligonucleotides 16FA(-)_40bp and 16AR(+)_40bp.\nHeat the annealing mixture at 90 °C for 5 min and cool down over 3 h to 30 °C using a PCR machine. Store the annealed DNA at -20 °C.\n2. DNA Strand Pairing and Displacement Assays\nPerform DNA strand pairing assay.\n\t\nPrepare 1.6 mL of reaction buffer A (30 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 1 mM dithiothreitol [DTT], 15 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM ATP, 0.1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin [BSA], and 0.0075% polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate) containing 36 nM 16FA(-) in a 2.0 mL micro-centrifuge plastic tube (polypropylene) and pre-incubate it at 37 °C for 5 min.\nTo form Rad51-ssDNA filaments, add Rad51 protein to a final concentration of 1.5 µM in the pre-incubated reaction buffer and incubate it at 37 °C for 5 min.",
    "Add Swi5-Sfr1 protein to the mixture to a final concentration of 0.15 µM and incubate it at 37 °C for a further 5 min.\nTake 1.5 mL of the mixture and transfer it into a 1.0 x 1.0 cm quartz cuvette containing a magnetic stirrer and set the cuvette into a spectrofluorometer. Configure the peltier temperature controller of the spectrophotometer to 37 °C and set the magnetic stirrer to 450 rpm to ensure rapid mixing of the injected sample.\nStart measuring the fluorescence emission of FAM at 525 nm (bandwidth: 20 nm) upon excitation at 493 nm (bandwidth: 1 nm). Collect data every second.\nAfter starting the measurement for 100 s, inject ROX-labeled donor dsDNA to a final concentration of 36 nM into the mixture using a syringe and measure the change in emission at 1 s intervals for a further 30 min.\nPerform DNA strand displacement assay.\n\t\nPrepare 1.6 mL of reaction buffer A containing 36 nM 16A(-) in a 2.0 mL micro-centrifuge plastic tube and pre-incubate it at 37 °C for 5 min.\nForm Rad51-ssDNA filaments in the presence of Swi5-Sfr1 at 37 °C, as described in steps 2.1.2. and 2.1.3.\nTake 1.5 mL of the mixture and transfer it into the quartz cuvette containing a magnetic stirrer and set the cuvette into the spectrophotometer, as described in step 2.1.4.\nStart measuring the fluorescence emission and after 100 s, inject FAM- and ROX-labeled donor dsDNA as described in step 2.1.6. Measure the change in fluorescence emission at 1 s intervals for a further 30 min.\n3. Analyzing Experimental Data from the Pairing and Displacement Assays\nEstimate maximum FRET efficiency.\n\t\nPrepare 16FA(-) annealed with 16AR(+)_40bp and 16FA(-)_40bp annealed with 16AR(+)_40bp using the same procedure described in steps 1.3 and 1.4.",
    "Prepare 130 μL of reaction buffer A containing 36 nM of either 16FA(-), 16FA(-) annealed with 16AR(+)_40bp, 16FA(-)_40bp annealed with 16AR(+)_40bp or 16FA(-)_40bp in a 0.2 x 1.0 cm quartz cuvette.\nSet the cuvette into the spectrofluorometer and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.\nMeasure fluorescence spectra from 500 to 600 nm upon excitation at 493 nm.\nTo test the effect of Rad51 on the emission of FAM and quenching of FAM by ROX, add Rad51 to a final concentration of 1.5 μM to the mixture and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.\nMeasure fluorescence spectra from 500 to 600 nm upon excitation at 493 nm.\nCalculate maximum FRET efficiency (Emaximum) using the equation described below:\n\t\tEmaximum = (Fluorescence intensity at 525 nm of dsDNA labeled with both FAM and ROX) / (Fluorescence intensity at 525 nm of FAM labeled ssDNA)\nAnalyze experimental data from the displacement assay.\n\t\nTo convert the change in fluorescence observed in the displacement assay to the change in the amount of final product, normalize raw experimental data obtained from this assay using the equation described below, where Fraw is fluorescence intensity from raw data and Fnormalized is the change in fluorescence calculated by the following equation.\n\t\tFnormalized = ([Fraw at time x] - [Fraw at time 0]) / (([Fraw at time 0] / Emaximum) - [Fraw at time 0])\n\t\t​Fraw at time 0 is the average fluorescence monitored for the first 5 s after the dead time (i.e., the time required for mixing after an injectant is introduced into the cuvette).\nTo exclude the effects of photobleaching and spontaneous displacement, subtract Fnormalized without protein from Fnormalized of the sample to obtain FD, which is the change in the amount of final product in this assay.",
    "FD = [Fnormalized of sample] - [Fnormalized without protein]\nAnalyze experimental data from the pairing assay.\n\t\nNormalize raw experimental data obtained from the pairing assay using the equation described below, where Fraw is fluorescence intensity from raw data and Fnormalized is the change in fluorescence calculated by the following equation.\n\t\tFnormalized = (Fraw at time x) / (Fraw at time 0)\n\t\t​Fraw at time 0 is the average fluorescence monitored for the last 20 s before initiating the reaction by injecting the dsDNA substrate.\nTo convert change in fluorescence into change in amount of substrate and exclude the effects of photobleaching and spontaneous pairing, normalize Fnormalized of sample using the equation described below, where FP is the change in amount of substrate in this assay.\n\t\t​FP = 1 - (([Fnormalized without protein] - [Fnormalized of sample]) / [1-Emaximum])\nTo examine the reaction kinetics of DNA strand exchange, perform non-linear last-square regression analysis of the pairing reaction using the analysis program23 (see Table of Materials).\n\t\t\nPrepare a file in .txt format containing time course data of FP.\nStart the program and paste the script in the Supplemental Code File into a window of the program:\nStart non-linear last-square regression analysis. The results of this analysis will be displayed in the same window."
