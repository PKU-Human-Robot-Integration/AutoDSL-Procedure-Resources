    "1. Culturing of 1536-well 3D Tumor Spheroids\nPrepare a fresh 3D tumor spheroid medium stem (cell medium + knockout serum replacement + insulin-transferrin-selenium) by adding the following reagents to 500 mL of Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM/F12): 1x penicillin/streptomycin, 10 ng/mL of human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), 20 ng/mL of human epidermal growth factor (EGF), 0.4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Fraction V), 1x insulin-transferrin-selenium, and 1% knockout (KO) serum replacement (do not freeze-thaw).\nFilter-sterilize the entire medium with the supplements through a 0.4 µm bottle-top filter system.\nDetach the cancer cell lines, which have been growing according to recommended routine culture conditions, from the traditional cell-culture flasks by washing them 3x with 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and adding an appropriate amount of 0.25% trypsin (1 mL per 5 cm2) for 5 min to create a thin layer over the cells. Neutralize the trypsin with 5x the amount of the medium containing the serum and proceed to count the cells. For example, use 25 mL of medium for 5 mL of trypsin.\nAdjust the concentration of the cell solution to 62.5 x 104 cells/mL in order to seed a total of 500 cells per well in 8 µL of spheroid medium into the 1536-well tissue-culture-treated plates.\nIn a biological safety cabinet, seed the cells using a sterilized, small stainless-steel-tipped cassette with a peristaltic-pump-based system. Between different cell lines, flush the tubing of the cassette with 1x PBS and 70% Ethanol for 10 s.\nAlternatively, seed the cells using a liquid handler located within a HEPA-filtered room using either a sterilized, small stainless-steel-tipped cassette and a peristaltic pump or an attached syringe pump, depending on the number of plates per cell line needed.\nSeal the plates using a breathable adhesive plate seal either manually or using a plate sealer.",
    "Place the plates in a spinning incubator set at 10 rpm and 37 °C with 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) and 95% relative humidity. Allow the spheroids to form for 3 d.\n2. Culturing of 1536-well 2D Cancer Lines\nNOTE: The 1536-well 2D cancer lines should be cultured 24 h before the addition of the compound to the 3D plates.\nPrepare a 2D cancer cell medium by adding the following reagents to 500 mL of an appropriate growth medium for the selected lines: 1x penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).\nFilter-sterilize the entire medium with the supplements through a 0.4 µm bottle-top filter system.\nDetach the cancer cell lines, which have been growing according to recommended routine culture conditions, from the traditional cell-culture flasks by washing them 3x with 1x PBS and adding an appropriate amount of 0.25% trypsin (1 mL per 5 cm2) for 5 min to create a thin layer over the cells. Neutralize the trypsin with 5x the amount of the medium containing the serum and proceed to count the cells. For example, use 25 mL of medium for 5 mL of trypsin.\nAdjust the concentration of the cell solution to 62.5 x 104 cells/mL in order to seed a total of 500 cells per well in 8 µL of complete medium into 1536-well tissue-culture-treated plates.\nIn a biological safety cabinet, seed the cells using a sterilized, small stainless-steel-tipped cassette with a peristaltic-pump-based system. Between the different cell lines, flush the tubing of the cassette with 1x sterile PBS and 70% Ethanol for 10 s.\nAlternatively, seed the cells using a liquid handler located within a HEPA-filtered robotics room using either a sterilized, small stainless-steel-tipped cassette and a peristaltic pump or the attached syringe pump, depending on the volume of the plates per cell line needed.",
    "Seal the plates using a breathable adhesive plate seal either manually or using a plate sealer.\nPlace the plates in a spinning incubator set at 10 rpm and 37 °C for 24 h prior to the compound addition, with 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity.\n3. Compound Addition\nPrepare 8-point, 3-fold serial dilutions of MAPK inhibitors in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) on a liquid-handling robot with a 10 mM top concentration. The proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib is used as a positive control for a complete cell killing to determine the dynamic range of the assay.\nQuick-spin all assay plates and compound plates at 100 x g to collect any condensation. Remove the adhesive seal from each plate and place a plate on an acoustic dispenser set-up to add a total of 8 nL of each compound/dilution representing a final concentration of 0.1% DMSO per well and a top compound dose of 10 µM.\nAfter the addition of the compound is completed, place a custom-made, stainless-steel cell culture lid which prevents evaporation on the plate and place the plate into a spinning incubator at 37 °C for 5 d, with 5% CO2 and 95% relative humidity.\n4. Detection Reagent Addition and the Acquirement of Raw Data\nPre-warm an adequate volume of a cell lysis reagent containing luciferin to detect changes in adenine triphosphate (ATP) and, thus, changes in the cell proliferation at room temperature or in a 37 °C water bath. Add a total of 3 µL of the detection reagent to each well using a peristaltic pump and incubate the plate at room temperature for at least 15 min.\nCapture the luminescence on a plate luminometer.\n5. Data Processing",
    "Extract the raw data from the instrument and normalize all fields containing test compounds to the average of all wells containing DMSO alone as the neutral control. From this value, calculate the percent growth inhibition of each compound. This is completed using the formula function in Microsoft Excel where f(x)={(sample value relative light units (RLUs)/(average DMSO value RLUs)*100)}.\nGenerate the dose-response curves and inhibitory IC50s by graphing the values of the normalized data from step 5.1 against the compound concentration using a graphing program.\n\tNOTE: We analyzed the data using Helios, an internal NIBR software tool. To complete this function, we selected the nonparametric curve analysis tool.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
