    "All animal-involved protocols described in this manuscript have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UCSF.\n1. Preparation of polymer electrode arrays for insertion (~30 min)\nAttach piece 1 to piece 2 by inserting a screw through aligned, vertically oriented holes to lock the pieces together (Figure 2). Hold these two pieces in a vice. Attach double-sided tape (Table of Materials) to the top of piece 2. Attach the stabilizing piece 4 to the end of piece 1. It will be held in place by friction.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59957/59957fig02.jpg\nFigure 2: Assembly for array-shuttle alignment.\n(A) Assembly of pieces 1, 2, and stabilizing piece in preparation of insertion shuttle attachment.

When the probe is aligned with the longitudinal axis of piece 1, adhere the array connector to the polyimide double-sided tape on the flat portion of piece 2.\nWith plastic tipped forceps, contacting only the polyimide wing attached to the array ribbon, lift the insertion shuttle-electrode array device tip off piece 1, to the exterior of the stabilizing piece (Figure 3A).\nApply a small amount of cyanoacrylate (Table of Materials) or other adhesive (~10 µL) to the end of piece 1. Too little will not strongly adhere the insertion shuttle to piece 1, risking detachment during insertion or retraction. Too much risks overflowing the shuttle and adhering the array itself to piece 1.",
    "Using plastic tipped forceps, contacting only the polyimide wing attached to the array ribbon, re-align the device with the narrow segment of piece 1, with the square tab of the insertion shuttle (and only the shuttle) atop the glue (Figure 3B). Make small alignment adjustments by manipulating the side of the silicon shuttle or the PEG. Avoid applying excessive force to the ribbon or shanks.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59957/59957fig03.jpg\nFigure 3: Alignment, attachment, and sterilization of array-shuttle.\n(A) Proper orientation of insertion shuttle-electrode array device for application of glue on docking station of piece 1.

Steam sterilization is not appropriate for these devices.\n2. Design of base piece\nDetermine craniectomy sizes for selected stereotactic targets as well as locations of skull screws and ground screws. Craniectomy size is determined by array footprint, with a few hundred (~300) micron circumference for placement adjustments to avoid surface vasculature.",
    "Using a design software (e.g., CAD), design the footprint of the base piece to surround the planned craniectomies and fit within the perimeter defined by the temporal ridge and skull screws, maximizing skull surface area that will be outside of the base piece to which adhesive luting cement can bind to adhere the implant to the skull.\nContour the bottom surface of the base piece so it can be adhered to the skull without gaps, reducing the chance of infection and preventing saline or silicone elastomer from seeping out.\nSet the height of the base piece to 3-7 mm, high enough to hold saline and silicone elastomer but low enough to not impede visibility during array insertion(s).\n\tNOTE: The base piece can be designed with vertical posts or similar features to which the polyimide wings can be tethered at a point higher above the skull. Do not allow attachment points to impede view.\n3D print the base piece (Figure 4) and sterilize the base piece prior to implantation.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59957/59957fig04.jpg\nFigure 4: Skull prepared for implant.\nDurectomies complete with skull screws, base acrylic layer, and base piece fixed to skull.\n3. Preparation of skull (~2 h)\nSelect a rat 400 g or greater to support the weight of the implant. Male Long-Evans rats, at 6-12 months of age were used.\nAnesthetize the rat. Place the animal into an anesthesia chamber. Turn on 5% isoflurane.\nInject an intraperitoneal dose of ketamine (50 mg/kg), xylazine (6 mg/kg), and atropine (0.14 mg/kg).\n\t\nMonitor anesthesia depth every 20 min throughout the procedure by verifying there is no withdrawal from paw pinch and respiratory rate remains 50-75 breaths/min.\nApply eye ointment to the rat.\nShave the head of the rat.\nPlace the animal into the stereotaxic holder.",
    "Prepare the surgical site by scrubbing with three alternating scrubs each of Povidone-iodine surgical scrub, followed by sterile saline.\nInject 0.2 cc of 0.5% lidocaine into the scalp.\nMake a sagittal incision at the midline of the skull exposing at least 3 mm anterior to the bregma and 3 mm posterior to the lambda.\nRemove the periosteum using cotton swabs.\nMark insertion and craniectomy sites by scoring the skull with a scalpel using a Cartesian coordinate plane zeroed at the bregma with a stereotactic instrument.\nDrill craniectomy sites, leaving a thin layer of bone that can be removed with forceps. Do not expose dura. This allows for cleaning skull of bone dust without disrupting dura.\nDrill and insert bone screws, one at a time, to prevent bone dust from entering the holes. Use generous isotonic irrigation to remove bone dust. For an implant of approximately 50 grams, use 10-12 screws. Titanium screws allow osseointegration49.\n\t\nAdvance the screws to a depth that fully penetrates the skull without impacting the brain.\nConnect at least one bone screw to an electrically conductive wire to function as a circuit ground.\nAfter all drilling is complete, clean the skull of bone dust with a saline wash.\nDry the skull with cotton swabs or other absorbents and apply an initial layer of adhesive luting cement (Table of Materials) to the screws (do not use enamel etchant on rodent skull). This preliminary adhesive luting cement layer will increase implant adhesion and decrease labor in later adhesion steps.\nRemove the thin layer of bone remaining at each craniectomy site.\nIncise dura using a 30-gauge needle with a bent tip while avoiding any vasculature. The length of the incision matches the dimensions of the insertion shuttle.",
    "If there is bleeding, irrigate manually with a gentle saline drip and do not continue until the bleeding has stopped.\nIf multiple durectomies are being performed, keep sites moist with gel foam or another method, such as regular irrigation every few minutes with body-temperature saline.\nDry the skull again with cotton swabs or other absorbents in preparation for luting cement adhesion of the base piece to the skull.\nPosition the sterile base piece. If the base piece will cover the bregma, mark another location at a known distance away as a proxy.\nApply adhesive luting cement around the perimeter of the base piece. Fill the adhered base piece with saline; identify and patch any leakage with adhesive luting cement at the interface between the base piece and the skull interface (Figure 5).\n\tNOTE: It is crucial that the base piece be completely secured to the skull to prevent leakage of the artificial dural sealant silicone gel, as this will prevent adequate adhesion of the implant to the skull. The animal is ready to have arrays inserted.\n4. Serial insertions of arrays and retractions of shuttles (~1 h per array)\nNOTE: This procedure should be piloted with a nonviable device, particularly for multiple-array implants where one device may interfere with the implantation of subsequent devices.\nLoad pieces 1 and 2 onto the retraction micromanipulator piston. Set piece 1’s micromanipulator to an extended position and piece 3’s micromanipulator to a retracted position. The piston will slide to a terminal depth inside of piece 1. Piece 2 fits within the top portion of piece 3, with the holes aligned.\n\t\nLoad piece 3 onto the insertion micromanipulator piston, and secure in place with a screw on the underside of piece 3 (Figure 5A,B).",
    "Load and screw pieces 2 and 3 together, so that moving the insertion micromanipulator moves the whole insertion apparatus (Figure 5C).\nRemove the screw that holds pieces 1 and 2 together. Piece 1 moves independently of Piece 2, to allow separate retraction of the insertion shuttle from the apparatus.\nInsert this screw into the lateral hole of piece 1, perpendicular to the piston track, until the screw applies pressure on the piston. This assures that piece 1 moves in accordance with the retracting piston, as seen in Figure 5D. Be sure to choose the lateral hole that will not impede vision when the apparatus is mounted on the stereotactic instrument.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59957/59957fig05.jpg\nFigure 5: Assembly of inserter.\n(A) Mounting of piece 3 to micromanipulators.

Use the real or proxy bregma for stereotactic targeting. When moving the device to the insertion site, maintain a height of at least a few centimeters above the skull.\n\t\nAvoid prolonged periods of the array-shuttle device near the skull or brain to decrease the chances that condensation will detach the array from the insertion shuttle prior to or during insertion. If this occurs, attempt to raise the array-shuttle device high above the brain and skull and wait for it to dry and re-adhere.\nAdjust implant coordinates to avoid surface vasculature. As during craniectomy and durectomy, avoid penetrating vessels directly.",
    "Insert the device briskly (~25 µm/s), lowering with the stereotactic instrument until the device enters the brain. The device will not penetrate the brain immediately. The degree of resistance and dimpling will depend on the target location and the device design (e.g., two versus four shanks, tip angle), but dimpling usually does not exceed 1 mm (Figure 6).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59957/59957fig06.jpg\nFigure 6 : Array-shuttle insertion.\nArray-shuttle is advanced into brain to target depth. Four-shank array-shuttle shown.\nOnce in the brain, lower with micromanipulator, decreasing speed on approach to target depth:\n\t\nUse the stereotactic arm to start inserting at 25 µm/s.\nUse the micromanipulator to insert at 10 µm/s when 2 mm to 1 mm above the target depth.\nSlow insertion with micromanipulator to 5 µm/s when 1 mm to 500 µm above the target depth.\nSlow insertion further to 1-2 µm/s during the final 500 µm to the target.\nVisualize the device wings (horizontal polyimide tubing) and the point of insertion during lowering to avoid premature shuttle-array detachment.\nWhen the target depth has been reached (Figure 7A), bilaterally anchor the polyimide wings to the base piece attachment sites via light-curable acrylic or another adhesive such as cyanoacrylate (Table of Materials). Dry, if necessary, the wings or the attachment point on the base piece, as condensation can collect on these surfaces and prevent adhesion. If visibility or other space constraints require, anchoring at only one polyimide wing is typically sufficient.",
    "Prior to dissolution, the PEG will appear as a globular mass sitting atop the array and insertion shuttle interface (Figure 7A). Dissolve PEG by gently dripping body-temperature saline on the array at the point where it is adhered to the shuttle. The length of time this requires will depend on the molecular weight of the PEG selected and complete dissolution can be verified with direct visualization. When the PEG has fully dissolved the boundaries of the arrays will be completely discernable from the shuttle and piece 1 (Figure 7B).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59957/59957fig07.jpg\nFigure 7: Retraction of shuttle.\n(A) Tethering of wings before retraction.

Continue saline irrigation (~1 drop/s) onto the array being retracted. Use retraction speeds that are the same as the insertion speed at relevant distances from target depth:\n\t\nRetract using the micromanipulator at 1-2 µm/s from target depth to -500 µm.\nSpeed up the retraction using the micromanipulator at 5 µm/s when -500 µm to -1 mm.\nSpeed up the retraction using the micromanipulator at 10 µm/s when -1 mm to -2 mm.\nRetract using the stereotactic arm at 25 µm/s from -2 mm from target and upwards.",
    "Visualize the interface between the array and insertion shuttle during retraction. The polymer array will visibly separate from the shuttle and appear translucent as the shuttle is retracted at the semicircular junction between shanks of the insertion shuttle (Figure 7B).\nRemove the array connector from piece 2 and move to a location that will not interfere with subsequent insertions. The polymer electrode array is now in the brain and no longer connected to the stereotactic instrument (Figure 7C). Remove the insertion shuttle and other insertion hardware.\nFor multiple insertions, repeat steps 4.1-4.9; do not move on to next section until all desired arrays are inserted. It is ill-advised to insert two devices within 250 µm of each other, as the slight bowing of the device ribbon between brain and wings in the strain relief region can extend at least this far.\n5. Implant construction (~2 h)\nAfter the final array insertion, empty saline from the base piece using a pipette or cotton swab, being careful not to disrupt the implanted arrays or ribbons.\nFill the craniectomies and the base piece with low-viscosity silicone elastomer, or other artificial dural sealant. Allow it to cure (Figure 7D). With multiple insertions, place the hardware connectors where they do not interfere (Figure 8A). Appropriately orient the array connectors, and construct implant, so the ribbons are in their final desired position.\nCover the arrays, array ribbons, and connectors in medium-viscosity silicone elastomer. Give special attention to the polymer-connector interface, as this soft-hard material interface is prone to damage. Cover the array ribbons completely such that when the medium-viscosity silicone cures, they are immobilized.\nEnclose the elastomer-covered devices in the designed case.",
    "Reinforce the implant base with dental acrylic. Do not allow acrylic to come into direct contact with the array ribbons because expansion of the acrylic while it cures can damage the conductive traces.\nApply Bupivicaine and bacitracin ointment around the incision.\nClose the incision using 4-0 nylon sutures and skin glue.\n6. Recovery and implant care\nRemove animal from stereotactic instrument and place on its side on a heating pad.\nGive subcutaneous injection of warm Ringer’s solution (5 – 10 mL) to hydrate animal.\nOnce animal is locomoting (10 – 60 min), transfer to a cage with half of the cage under a heating pad at 37 °C for 2-3 days.\nUnder a heating pad, give access to softened food and water.\nInject animal with 2 mg/kg Meloxicam every 24 h (subcutaneous or oral administration) for 1 week as needed for pain control.\nAllow the rat 1-2 weeks to heal and adjust to the implant weight (Figure 8B).\nPerform regular chlorhexidine wash of the tissue around the implant and daily inspection for irritation, infection, or dehiscence.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59957/59957fig08.jpg\nFigure 8: Multiple inserted arrays and rat after recovery from implantation.
