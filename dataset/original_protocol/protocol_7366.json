    "Assay setup  Set up the appropriate number of 0.5 mL plastic tubes in a rack at room temperature. Reactions should be performed in at least duplicate.Prepare fresh reaction buffer (room temperature) by adding DTT prior to the start of the assay.Prepare a suspension of streptavidin-coated beads in wash buffer.Transfer a total volume of slurry corresponding to 15 µL of slurry per reaction into a tube.  Example: In an assay with eight reactions to be assayed in duplicate, 240 µL [(8  ×  2)  ×  15 µL] of slurry should be prepared along with an additional 60 µL (4  ×  15 µL) for the standards, to make a total of 300 µL slurry (240 µL + 60 µL). The combined slurry should be resuspended with 1,000 µL [(16 + 4)  ×  50 µL] wash buffer after washing. Be sure to include in the calculation for the beads the additional beads needed for NBD standards at the end of the assay (see step C5).  Wash the beads once by adding a total volume of wash buffer corresponding to 50 µL per reaction to the tube and inverting the tube several times.Centrifuge the beads at 2,700 ×  g  and 4 °C for 1 min in a tabletop microcentrifuge and aspirate the supernatant using a 26½ G needle.Resuspend the beads with a total volume of wash buffer corresponding to 50 µL of wash buffer per reaction.Keep tube on ice.Aliquot reaction buffer and the desired concentrations of NBD-fatty acyl-CoA (we typically use 10 μM) and Shh peptide (we typically use 10 μM) into each tube. For inhibition or substrate competition assays, include drug/inhibitor [e.g., RU-SKI 201 (Cayman, catalog number: 21101)] or unlabeled substrates (e.g., non-fluorescent fatty acyl-CoA or non-biotinylated Shh protein/peptide) at desired concentrations. Include appropriate control reactions.",
    "Note: The final volume in each tube should be 100 µL, and importantly, should include a final concentration of 0.1% DDM (detergent component of the purified Hhat eluate). Final concentrations of MES, OG (w/v), and DTT from the reaction buffer should be in the range of 125 mM, 0.06%, and 750 µM, respectively. If desired, a master mix of reaction buffer and substrates can be prepared.   Reaction  Initiate the reaction by adding purified Hhat enzyme (or equivalent volume of mock purified eluate or elution buffer as a negative control) (we typically use 130 nM Hhat). Briefly vortex and pulse-spin in a PicoFuge to collect the sample at the bottom of the tube.Immediately incubate the reactions in the dark at 37 °C for the desired amount of time. Note: For kinetic studies, a time course must be performed first to determine the linear range of the reaction. Suggested time points for initial kinetic studies are 0, 10, 20, 40, 60, and 90 min.  Quench the reactions by placing the tubes on ice and adding 60 µL of ice-cold bead suspension. Isolation and quantification of reaction products  Incubate tubes in the dark with rocking at 4 °C for 1 h.Centrifuge the beads at 2,700 ×  g  and 4 °C for 1 min in a tabletop microcentrifuge and carefully aspirate the supernatant using a 26½ G needle.Wash the beads three times with 100 µL of wash buffer. Between each wash, spin tubes and aspirate supernatant as above. Tip for washing: place the tubes in a single rack, cover the top of the rack, and invert the rack approximately five times to wash.",
    "After the final wash, carefully aspirate the supernatant, resuspend the beads in each tube with 60 µL of wash buffer, and carefully transfer the beads from each tube to individual wells of a black side, transparent bottom 96-well plate. Use a fresh pipette tip for each tube. Note: To maximize bead transfer, after the first transfer of beads into the plate, use the pipette tip to push residual beads from the sides down to the bottom of the tube where some suspension remains and transfer this remaining suspension into the same well.  To obtain a conversion factor of NBD fluorescence (RFU) to pmol of NBD-labeled product for data quantification (see next section), load standards [known amounts (e.g., 500–2,000 pmol)] of NBD-acyl-CoA in bead suspension (60 µL, as in step C4) into separate wells of the plate.Read NBD fluorescence (RFU) in a plate reader at excitation/emission wavelengths of 465/535 nm."
