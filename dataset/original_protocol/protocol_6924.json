    "PreparationPrepare fresh DRGs from experimental animals (Lin et al., 2018). Alternatively, DRG samples can be prepared in advance and stored at -80°C.Prepare the fresh buffers listed below and maintain them at 4°C (buffer volumes shown below are for one DRG sample).Note: It is important to vortex any solutions containing iodixanol well every time before use. 7.5 ml Working Solution (50% iodixanol): 6.25 ml 60% iodixanol solution + 1.25 ml Diluent.1.25 ml 30% iodixanol: 750 μl Working Solution + 500 μl Stock Buffer HB + 1.5 μl 35% BSA + 2 μl RNase inhibitor.1.25 ml 40% iodixanol: 1 ml Working Solution + 250 μl Stock Buffer HB + 1.5 μl 35% BSA + 2 μl RNase inhibitor.5 ml Working Buffer HB: 5 ml Stock Buffer HB + 6 μl 35% BSA + 7.5 μl RNase inhibitor.400 μl 5% IGEPAL CA-630: 20 μl IGEPAL CA-630 + 380 μl Working Buffer HB.Pre-cool centrifuge, ultracentrifuge, and rotor to 4°C. All centrifugations should be done at 4°C.Note: Using swing-bucket rotors is recommended to improve the final nuclei recovery. Prepare one ultracentrifuge tube for each DRG sample. In each tube, prepare the density gradient solution by layering 1 ml 40% iodixanol at the bottom and then slowly adding 1 ml 30% iodixanol on top of it, without disturbing the interface. Pre-cool tubes on ice.Note: While preparing the density gradient solution, pipette just above the 40% layer against the wall, allowing it to form two distinct layers. Try again if you do not see two distinct layers after sitting for 1 min. Before placing the tube on ice, pre-indent the ice with another tube to avoid disrupting the density gradient layers. LysisTransfer each DRG sample to a 5-ml centrifuge tube. Prepare one DRG sample at a time.",
    "Add 4 ml Working Buffer HB to the 7-ml Dounce homogenizer and pre-cool the homogenizer on ice.Add 1 ml ice-cold Working Buffer HB to the DRG sample and place the tube on ice for 15-30 s until the DRGs sink.Homogenize the DRG sample with a Tissue-Tearor using the low setting (< level four out of seven levels for Tissue-Tearor 985370-04) for about 5 s. Visually inspect the sample and confirm that the tissue is homogenized.Transfer the homogenate to the pre-cooled 7-ml Dounce homogenizer.Further homogenize the tissue by douncing with a tight pestle for 10-12 strokes.Add 320 μl 5% IGEPAL CA-630 and dounce with a tight pestle for five additional strokes. Dounce slowly to avoid bubbles.Filter the homogenate through a 40-μm cell strainer into a 50-ml conical tube.Add 5 ml recently vortexed Working Solution to the lysed sample to reach a final volume of 10 ml. Gently pipette up and down to mix the solution.Note: The iodixanol concentration in the lysed sample is 25%. Place the 50-ml conical tube containing 10 ml lysed sample on ice. Repeat Steps B1-B9 for each additional DRG sample.Note: Lysed samples can be placed on ice for as long as 30 min before proceeding to Procedure C. It is important to remove undissociated myelin and fully clean the Tissue-Tearor and 7-ml Dounce homogenizer by rinsing with Stock Buffer HB several times between samples. Gradient formation and centrifugationUsing a 1-ml pipette tip, slowly pipette each of the lysed samples onto the 30% iodixanol layer of the density gradient solution prepared in Step A3.Balance the weight of the samples with nuclease-free water prior to centrifugation. Seal the top of each ultracentrifuge tube with parafilm.Ultracentrifuge samples at 10,000 × g (equivalent to 7,600 rpm with SW 41 Ti rotor) for 18 min at 4°C.",
    "After ultracentrifugation, white particles that contain the desired nuclei may be visible at the interface between 30% and 40% iodixanol if there is sufficient starting material (Figure 1).Discard ~10 ml of the top layer to facilitate access to the interface between 30% and 40% iodixanol.Place a 1-ml pipette tip at the interface between the 30% and 40% iodixanol layers. While moving the pipette tip around the layer, slowly aspirate 400 μl nuclei sample just above the 40% iodixanol layer and transfer it to a new 1.5-ml centrifuge.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4102/bioprotoc-11-15-4102-g001.jpgFigure 1. Illustration of iodixanol layers and nuclei positions after ultracentrifugation Dilution and resuspensionNote: This step may vary based on the downstream analyses. Here, we demonstrate the sample preparation for inDrops single-cell RNA sequencing (Zilioniset et al., 2017) and 10× Genomics assays such as the Single Cell Gene Expression Assay and Single Cell Assay for Transposase-accessible Chromatin (ATAC). As an optional step, fluorescence-activated cell sorting can be used to further remove cellular debris and/or purify genetically labeled cell populations. inDropsTake 10 μl nuclei sample, stain it with Trypan Blue, and count nuclei using a hemocytometer (Figure 2).Dilute nuclei with 30% iodixanol to 80,000 nuclei/ml.Proceed to inDrops.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4102/bioprotoc-11-15-4102-g002.jpgFigure 2.
