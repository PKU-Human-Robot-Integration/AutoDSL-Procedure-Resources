    "The animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Kaohsiung Medical University, Taiwan (protocol no: IACUC-102046, 104063, 105158).\n1. Animal Preparation and Anesthesia\nPorcine animal model\n\tNote: This study applied the protocol described in the literature to establish a prospective porcine model of IONM11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,22.\n\t\nUse KHAPS Black or Duroc-Landrace pigs (3-4 months old; weighing 18-30 kg).\nEnsure that the experimental protocol is consistent with national/international regulations and guidelines for animal experiments, including the 3R principles (replacement, reduction, and refinement). Obtain ethical approval of the experimental protocol from the committee for care and use of experimental animals at the relevant institution.\nAnesthesia induction\n\t\nPre-anesthesia preparations\n\t\t\nWithhold food 8 hours before anesthesia and withhold water 2 hours before anesthesia.\nPre-medicate with intramuscular azaperone (4 mg/kg) at 2 hours before anesthesia. Use a 500 mL saline bottle to fabricate a face mask for each piglet. Trim as needed to ensure a secure fit to the snout.\nUse the weighing function on the operating table to measure the net weight of each piglet (Figure 1A).\nMaintain body temperature with a circulating water mattress set to 40 °C.\nInduce general anesthesia (GA) with 2-4% sevoflurane at a fresh gas flow of 3 L/min via the face mask with the piglet in a prone position. GA can also be induced by intramuscular tiletamine and zloazepam. An adequate depth of anesthesia is usually achieved in 3-5 minutes. Confirm the depth of anesthesia by no severe movement to pain due to peripheral venous catheterization.\nIdentify a superficial vein on the outer side of one ear and sterilize the selected region (about 6 x 6 cm2) with 75% alcohol. For maximum safety, use a 24-gauge peripheral intravenous catheter.",
    "Administer intravenous anesthetic such as propofol (1-2 mg/kg) or thiamylal (5-10 mg/kg) to alleviate noxious stimulation by direct laryngoscopy.\n\t\tNote: Use of neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) is not suggested. In subsequent experiments, NMBA may complicate intubation by depressing spontaneous breathing and may diminish electromyography (EMG) signals. Additionally, sevoflurane inhalation combined with a bolus of propofol or short-acting barbiturates is reportedly sufficient for facilitating tracheal intubation.\nTracheal intubation (Figure 1B)\nPrepare the equipment and materials required for EMG tube intubation: a size #6 EMG endotracheal tube, a face mask for assisted ventilation, two slings to hold the mouth open, one gauze strip to pull the tongue, a blunt tip suction catheter, a veterinary laryngoscope with 20cm straight blades, an elastic bougie, a 20-mL syringe, a stethoscope, and adhesive tape.\nPosition the piglet in a prone position on the operating table. Align the head and body to ensure clear visualization of the upper airway.\nDirect the assistant to apply traction of the upper and lower jaw to maintain an adequate mouth opening and to avoid rotation or overextension of the head. Cover the tongue with gauze and pull the tongue out to optimize the visual field.\nHold the laryngoscope and place it directly in the oral cavity to depress the tongue.\nDirectly visualize the epiglottis and use the laryngoscope to press the epiglottis downward toward the tongue base.\nWhen the vocal cords are clearly identified, gently advance the elastic bougie into the trachea. Slight rotation of the elastic bougie may be required to overcome resistance. Next, advance the EMG tube at the mouth angle to a depth of 24 cm.\nInflate the EMG tube cuff to a volume no larger than 3 mL. If ventilation by manual bagging reveals no obvious air leakage, in situ deflation of the EMG tube is feasible.",
    "When the EMG tube is placed at the proper depth, confirm the free passage of fresh gas by manual bagging. Further confirm the proper tracheal intubation by end-tidal carbon dioxide (etCO2) monitoring (capnography) and chest auscultation for early identification of inadvertent esophageal or endobronchial intubation.\n\t\tNote: Capnography showed both the etCO2 waveform and the digital value in mmHg. When esophageal intubation occurred, etCO2 was absent or near zero after 6 breaths. When the EMG tube was in the correct place, the typical etCO2 waveform and adequate value (usually >30 mmHg) was noted. Furthermore, the breathing sound of a bilateral lung filled is clear and symmetric as determined by chest auscultation.\nUse medical tape to fix the EMG tube at the mouth angle. Since the tube usually requires adjustment during IONM experiments, do not fasten the tube to the snout.\nConnect the EMG tube to the ventilator. Continuous capnography is mandatory for monitoring the etCO2 value and curve throughout the experiment.\nAnesthesia maintenance (Figure 1C)\nAfter the EMG tube is fixed, position the piglet on its back with the neck extended (Figure 1C). Maintain general anesthesia with 1-3% sevoflurane in oxygen at 2 L/min.\nVentilate the lungs in volume-control mode at a tidal volume of 8-12 mL/kg, and set the respiratory rate to 12-14 breaths/min.\nBegin physiologic monitoring, including capnography, electrocardiography (ECG)and monitoring of oxygenation (SaO2).\n2. Equipment Setting and Animal Operation (Figure 1D)\nEquipment Setup\n\t\nConnect the channel leads from the EMG tube to the monitoring system.\nSet the monitoring system to run a 50 ms time window. Set pulsed stimuli to 100 μs and 4 Hz. Set the event capture threshold to 100 μV.\nSurgical procedure\n\t\nWear sterile surgical gloves and use povidone iodine with cotton swabs to disinfect the neck surgical site.",
    "Make a transverse collar incision about 10-15 cm in length with a scalpel to expose the neck and the larynx.\nRaise the subplatysmal flap 1 cm cranially from the clavicle to the hyoid bone.\nRemove the strap muscles and visualize the tracheal rings and nerves. Use monopolar and bipolar electrocautery to assist the surgical dissection and hemostasis.\nLocalize, identify, and carefully expose the EBSLN, RLN, and VN with a handheld stimulation probe.\nPosition an automated periodic stimulation (APS) electrode on one side of VN for stimulating during continuous IONM (CIONM). Connect the APS electrode with the monitoring system. Set pulsed stimuli to 1 Hz, 100 µs, and 1 mA.\nAt end of experiments, euthanize all piglets by the veterinarian.\n3. Electrical Stimulation\nNote: To apply the 3R principle in porcine IONM studies, always perform repeatable electrophysiology studies that do not cause nerve injury before performing experiments that may cause nerve injury. This can be used to study the intensity, safety, and cardiopulmonary effects11,17. The IONM equipment can be classified as stimulation equipment or recording equipment (Figure 2A).\nEvaluate the baseline EMG responses of the target nerves, including the EBSLN, RLN, and VN (Figures 2B, 2C).\n\t\nStart with an initial stimulation current of 0.1-mA current and increase stimulation in 0.1-mA increments until an EMG response is detected and recorded.\nFurther increase the current until the maximal EMG response is obtained.\nRecord the baseline amplitude, latency, and waveform of the EMG response.\nDefine the minimal stimulus level as the lowest current (mA) that clearly evoked EMG activity of >100 µV. Define the maximal stimulus level as the lowest current that evoked the maximal EMG response.\nEvaluate the Safety of electrical stimulation11,19\nApply a continuous 1-minute stimulus at the fifth tracheal ring level of the VN or RLN.",
    "Progressively increase the stimulus current from 1 mA to 30 mA.\nDuring VN stimulation, evaluate hemodynamic stability by monitoring of heart rate, ECG, and invasive arterial blood pressure.\nFinally, evaluate nerve function integrity by comparing EMG responses proximal to the nerve stimulation site before and after each level of stimulation is applied.\nEffect of anesthetics (muscle relaxants and their reversals)12,20\n\tNote: Improper use of NMBAs is a potential cause of unsuccessful IONM. The proposed animal model was used to compare recovery profiles among different depolarizing NMBAs (e.g., succinylcholine) and nondepolarizing NMBAs (e.g., rocuronium) at varying doses and to identify the optimal NMBA for use in IONM. The animal model can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of NMBA reversal drugs (e.g., sugammadex) for rapidly restoring neuromuscular function suppressed by rocuronium.\n\t\nFirstly, apply C-IONM and use the automatically calibrated baseline latencies and amplitudes of EMG as control data.\nAdminister a bolus injection of 0.3 mg/kg rocuronium in a volume of 10 mg/mL and observe the real-time EMG changes.\nThree minutes after injection, perform one injection of 2 mg/kg sugammadex in a volume of 100 mg/mL as a rapid bolus. Record the recovery profile of laryngeal EMG for 20 minutes.\nStimulation electrodes (Stimulation probes/dissectors) (Figure 3)17\n\tNote: There are different types of stimulation electrodes that can be used for nerve stimulation during IONM, e.g., monopolar probes (Figure 3A), bipolar probes (Figure 3B), and stimulation dissectors (Figure 3C).\n\t\nTo mimic direct stimulation of nerves during surgery, apply 1 mA stimulation to the EBSLN, RLN, and VN without overlying fascia.\nTo mimic indirect mapping and localizing of the nerve position before visual identification during surgery, apply 1 mA stimulation at a 1- and 2-mm distance away from the nerves at overlying fascia.",
    "Record and compare the EMG responses between different types of stimulation electrodes.\nRecording electrodes (EMG tubes/needle electrodes/pre-gelled skin electrodes) (Figure 4)\nUse the animal model to evaluate how rotation or upward/downward displacement of the EMG tube electrode (Figure 4A) affects the stability of the EMG signal. Additionally, use the animal model to compare the EMG responses between different electrode types (e.g., needle electrodes and adhesive pre-gelled electrodes, Figure 4B) and different recording approaches (e.g., transcutaneous/percutaneous and transcartilage approaches, Figures 4C and 4D) in terms of feasibility, stability, and accuracy during IONM.\nFor a feasibility study, apply a 1 mA stimulus current to bilateral EBSLNs, VNs and RLNs. Record and compare EMG responses evoked by each electrode tested (i.e., EMG tube, transcutaneous, percutaneous, and transcartilage electrodes).\nFor a stability study, evaluate and compare EMG signal stability in C-IONM under experimentally induced cricoid/tracheal cartilage displacement.\nFor an accuracy study, evaluate and compare the accuracy of the tested electrodes in C-IONM for identifying EMG signal degradation under RLN injury.\n4. RLN injury study (Figure 5)\nIn accordance with the 3R principle, perform RLN injury experiments in the porcine model after all repeatable electrophysiology studies are completed. Perform tests of nerve segments from proximal nerve segments to distal nerve segments (i.e., proceed from the caudal part of the RLN to the cranial part of the RLN).\nUse C-IONM to confirm and compare patterns of real-time changes in evoked laryngeal EMG signals during and after acute RLN injuries with different injury mechanisms (e.g., traction, clamping, transection, or thermal injuries) (Figures 5A and 5B). Use C-IONM for continuous real-time display and recordation of EMG changes and sequential recoveries throughout the experiment (Figure 5C).\nCollect injured RLN segments for histopathological analysis of morphological alterations caused by the nerve injury experiments.\nTraction compression/stretch injury",
    "Note: Traction compression or stretch injuries are the most common intraoperative RLN injuries. Experimentally induce traction stress and observe the resulting electrophysiological EMG changes and histopathological changes.\n\t\nTraction compression injury13\nWrap a thin plastic loop (e.g., a vascular loop 1.3-mm wide) around the RLN and use a force gauge to apply retraction with 50 g of tension (Figure 5A). This scheme mimics an RLN trapped against a dense, fibrous band or a crossing artery at the region of Berry’s ligament during medial traction of the thyroid lobe.\nTraction stretch injury16\nWrap the RLN with a wider elastic material (e.g., a 10-mm wide silicone Penrose drain), and use a force gauge to retract the RLN with 50 g of tension) This scheme mimics an RLN adhered to or encased in the goiter capsule and stretched forward during medial traction.\nClamping injury\n\tNote: Intraoperative mechanical trauma to the RLN usually results from poor exposure or visual misidentification of the RLN. 13,16\nAfter the traction compression RLN injury experiment, pinch the distal segment of the RLN with hemostatic forceps for one second. This scheme mimics the nerve being inadvertently clamped owing to visual misidentification as a vessel during the operation. Record the accompanying EMG signal change for comparison with further histopathological findings of the nerve specimen.\nThermal injury\n\tNote: Most intraoperative RLN thermal injuries result from thermal spread when electrocautery devices and various energy-based devices (EBDs) are used to induce hemostasis near the RLN. Like traction injury, thermal injury is rarely visible to the naked eye. Therefore, perform animal IONM experiments to determine the best model for evaluating the pathophysiology of RLN thermal injury and to test the thermal tolerance14 and the safety of EBDs15,18.\n\t\nUse C-IONM to register the EMG changes continuously throughout the experiment.",
    "For the activation study, investigate how energy-based devices (EBD) can be safely applied for hemostasis and dissection near the RLN during surgery (Figure 5B).\n\t\t\nActivate the EBD (electrothermal bipolar vessel sealing system, set power at level 2, and the energy discontinues automatically by 2 to 4 seconds) at a 5-mm distance away from the RLN.\nIf EMG signals remain stable after several tests, perform a further test at the narrower distance (e.g., 2-mm, and followed by 1mm distance).\nIf any substantial EMG change occurs after any test the experiment is complete and followed by continuous real-time EMG recording for at least 20 minutes.\nFor the cooling study, evaluate the cooling time to determine post-activation optimal EBD cooling parameters.\n\t\t\nContact the activated EBD on the RLN directly after a 5 second cooling time.\nIf the EMG signals remain stable after three tests, test the shorter cooling time (e.g., 2 seconds, and followed by 1 second).\nIf the EMG remains stable after repeated tests, confirm the safety of the EBD by touching the RLN immediately after activation.\nSubscription Required.
