    "This protocol requires the use of healthy donor-derived CD34+ HSPCs and requires ethical approval from the local institutional review boards (IRB) and signed informed consent. The CD34+ HSPCs used in this protocol were isolated from the umbilical cord blood (UCB) of term deliveries (>34 weeks of gestation). Informed consent was obtained from the mothers prior to delivery, and ethical approval for the collection of UCB was obtained (IRB approval: 31-322 ex 18/19) from the Medical University of Graz. A full list of materials used in this protocol can be found in the Table of Materials.\n1. sgRNA design and evaluation of cutting efficiencies\nSearch for the location of the desired mutation and the correct transcript on an online database tool (e.g., COSMIC, https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic).\nSelect an sgRNA adjacent to the mutation (exonic targeting) or in the previous intron (intronic targeting) by using an sgRNA design tool. In this protocol, the online tool from Benchling is used. See The Table of Materials for a list of possible online tools for sgRNA design.\nSelect the + (create) option > DNA Sequence > Import DNA Sequences > Import from Databases. Enter the desired gene e.g., CALR and select human as the species > Search > Select the correct transcript (e.g., CALR-201 -ENST00000316448) > Import. Select the region of interest in which to introduce the DS break (e.g., intron 7).\nSelect the CRISPR option on the right-hand side of the screen and select Design and analyze guides. Select single guide, keep the guide length to 20 bp, and PAM sequence for editing with SpCas9 (NGG).",
    "Pick a guide with a high on-target score (high chance for editing at the desired locus) and a high off-target score (low chance of editing at unwanted loci). Pick at least three guides to test in order to find the best performing sgRNA. Order the sgRNA as a chemically modified synthetic sgRNA from a commercial vendor.\n\tNOTE: It is advisable at this stage to order a small amount of the synthetic sgRNAs for the initial screen. Once a good performing sgRNA has been identified, proceed with a larger order of the selected sgRNA.\nThaw 2 x 105-5 x 105 CD34+ HSPCs. Transfer the cells into 10 mL of pre-warmed RPMI1640 supplemented with 1% antibiotics (e.g., penicillin/streptomycin).\n\tNOTE: CD34+ HSPCs with a purity >90% should be used to achieve the best and most reproducible results.\nCentrifuge at 350 x g at room temperature (RT) for 10 min. Count the cells with a hemocytometer and suspend the cells in SFEM II medium supplemented with 0.2% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S), 100 ng/mL thrombopoietin (TPO), 100 ng/mL stem cell factor (SCF), 100 ng/mL FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L), 100 ng/mL interleukin-6 (IL-6), 35 nM UM171, and 0.75 µM StemRegenin1 (SR1) to a concentration of 2.5 x 105 cells/mL . Incubate at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 48 h - 72 h.\n\tNOTE: The complete medium will be referred to from now on as the HSPC retention medium.\nCollect the cells in a 15 mL tube and count the cells. Check the cell viability by trypan blue exclusion.",
    "Before starting, turn on the transfection system and select the option for the cuvettes. Select the appropriate program and nucleofection solution for HSPCs (see Table of Materials). Between 2 x 105 and 5 x 106 cells can be nucleofected in one 100 µL cuvette. Set aside a small number of cells (e.g., 1 x 105-2 x 105) to keep in culture for 48 h to be used as a WT control.\nPrepare the RNP complex. In a 1.5 mL tube, add 15 µg of Cas9 and 8 µg of sgRNA (molar ratio 1:2.5) and incubate at 25 °C for 10 min in a heating block.\nWhile the RNP complex is incubating, centrifuge the cells at 350 x g at RT for 5 min and discard the supernatant by using a pipette. Suspend the cells in 100 µL of nucleofection solution.\nMix the cells with the RNP complex and transfer into the cuvette. Gently tap the cuvette to remove any eventual air bubbles that might have formed during the transfer.\nInsert the cuvette into the holder of the transfection system and electroporate the cells with the DZ-100 program.\nImmediately after electroporation, add 400 µL of pre-warmed HSPC retention medium without P/S.\nTransfer the cells with a fine transfer pipette into a culture plate containing pre-warmed HSPC retention medium without P/S. Depending on the cell number, use an appropriate culture plate (24-, 12-, or 6-well plate) in order to reach a density between 0.25 x 106 and 1 x 106 cells/mL.\nTransfer the plate to the incubator at 37 °C/5% CO2. Incubate the nucleofected cells for 6-8 h.",
    "Following 6-8 h, remove the old medium and replace with fresh pre-warmed HSPC retention medium supplemented with P/S. Suspend the cells at a concentration between 2.5 x 105 and 5 x 105 and transfer to a cell culture plate (24-, 12-, or 6-well plate). Incubate the cells for 48 h at 37°C/5% CO2.\nHarvest 2 x 105 cells and centrifuge at 350 x g at RT for 5 min. Before starting, set the heating blocks at 65 °C and 98 °C.\nDiscard the supernatant and suspend the cells in 1 mL of 1x DPBS in a 1.5 mL tube. Centrifuge at 350 x g at RT for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and suspend the cells in 50 µL of DNA extraction solution. Vortex for 15 s.\nIncubate for 6 min at 65 °C. Vortex for 15 s and incubate for 2 min at 98 °C.\nAmplify the region of the DSB by PCR using primers that generate an amplicon of about 400-600 bp with the DSB in the center. Use 0.5-1 μL of extracted DNA for the PCR reaction.\n\tNOTE: Due to the composition of the DNA extraction solution, the DNA concentrations cannot be accurately quantified by spectrophotometry.\nRun the PCR product with a DNA ladder on a 1.5 % agarose gel at 100 V for 45-60 min. Place the gel on a blue light or UV transilluminator.\nExtract the DNA band of the correct size from the gel by using a commercially available kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials).\nSequence the samples by Sanger sequencing using the forward primer or reverse primer from the PCR. For PCR products of 400-600 bp in length, 75 ng of DNA is required for sequencing with a concentration of 5 ng/mL in a total volume of 15 μL.",
    "Analyze the editing efficiency of the sgRNAs by uploading the sequencing files to a program designed to calculate the editing efficiency by identifying the insertion and deletions produced by the sgRNA. Select the best-performing sgRNA to proceed with.\n\t​NOTE: Dedicated online tools are listed in the Table of Materials. This analysis requires the .ab1 files of the transfected and WT HSPCs, the sgRNA sequence, and the PAM sequence.\n2. Homology-directed repair (HDR) vector construction\nHDR template design\n\tNOTE: Two HDR templates should be designed: a template for the WT sequence and a template for the mutated sequence.\n\t\nImport the genomic sequence and the coding sequence (CDS) of the desired gene into an appropriate software for molecular cloning (dedicated tools can be found listed in the Table of Materials). From the genomic sequence file, design the left homology arm (HA) by selecting ideally 400 bp on the 5' end of the DSB. Paste this sequence into a new file.\nIf an intron is targeted with the sgRNA, a splice acceptor (SA) sequence needs to be included. Select the last 150 bp of the targeted intron and paste it after the left HA. If the exon is directly targeted, this sequence is not necessary (Figure 3).\nFrom the CDS file, select the cDNA of interest. In case an exonic sequence is targeted, ensure the cDNA starts immediately downstream of the DSB site and includes all the following exons of the gene of interest as well as the stop codon. In case an intron is targeted, ensure the cDNA starts with the first codon of the following exon. Codon-optimize the cDNA and insert it after the SA sequence. Use dedicated online tools for this purpose (Table of Materials).",
    "Insert a 3' polyadenylation (PolyA) signal after the cDNA of interest (e.g., SV40 or bGH) (Table 1). Following the PolyA, insert a promoter sequence (e.g., spleen focus forming virus [SFFV] or polyubiquitin C [UBC], Table 1) for the fluorescent protein.\nInsert the sequence for the fluorescent protein (i.e., either GFP, BFP, or mCherry). Insert a second but different PolyA signal.\n\t\tNOTE: The insertion of a different PolyA sequence will avoid problems such as bacterial recombination of the plasmid or problems with sequence aligning because of two identical sequences in the template.\nFrom the genomic sequence file, design the right HA by selecting ideally 400 bp on the 3' end of the DSB. Insert this sequence after the second PolyA.\nCreate a copy of the whole template and modify the cDNA of interest so that it contains the sequence of the desired mutation.\nExchange the fluorescent protein with a different fluorescent protein. For example, if GFP was used for the WT template, then exchange it with BFP or mCherry for the mutant template. Construct and clone the HDR templates into the pAAV-MCS plasmid (or other suitable backbones).\n\t\tNOTE: The fragments required for the assembly can be produced either by PCR or ordered commercially and need to contain overlapping sequences with their neighboring fragments. If the mutation of interest is a point mutation, a small insertion, or a small deletion, the mutated cDNA can be produced by PCR by performing a site-directed mutagenesis on the HDR template containing the WT cDNA.\nTransform competent Escherichia coli with the assembled product by using the heat shock method. Before starting, place the bacteria to thaw on ice for 10 min.\nAdd 2 μL of the assembled products to 50 μL of bacteria. Mix the contents by gentle flicking.",
    "Place the samples on ice for 30 min. Transfer the samples to a thermoblock set to 42 °C for 30 s.\nTransfer the samples on ice for 5 min. Add 450 μL of room temperature SOC medium and incubate the samples at 37 °C for 1 h.\nSpread the samples onto LB agar plates containing ampicillin. For each sample, spread 100 μL of three different dilutions of the bacterial solution (undiluted, 1:5, and 1:10) in order to obtain LB agar plates with single colonies that can be picked. Incubate the plates overnight at 37 °C.\nThe next day, pick three colonies per sample. Transfer the colonies to 15 mL tubes with caps containing 4 mL of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin and incubate overnight in a shaker at 37 °C.\nAliquot 500 µL of the bacterial solution from each colony and store it in the fridge for later use. Perform a mini-prep to extract plasmid DNA as per the manufacturer's instructions.\nSend the samples for Sanger sequencing to confirm the correct assembly of the plasmids. Use enough primers distributed throughout the plasmid to ensure uninterrupted sequence confirmation, ideally covering each region twice with forward and reverse reads.\nAdd 200 µL of the bacterial solution containing the correctly assembled plasmid to 200 mL of LB media supplemented with ampicillin and incubate in a shaker overnight at 37 °C.\nPerform a midi- or maxi-prep to extract the plasmid DNA as per the manufacturer's instructions. Store the plasmid DNA at −20 °C.\nRecombinant AAV6 preparation\n\tNOTE: Two separate AAV6 preparations will need to be performed: one for the rAAV6 with the WT HDR template and one for the rAAV6 with the mutated HDR template. This section describes the steps needed for the preparation of only one virus.",
    "Thaw HEK293T cells, transfer the cells into 10 mL of pre-warmed DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% P/S, and 25 mM HEPES, and centrifuge at 350 x g at RT for 5 min.\nSuspend the cells at a concentration of 1 x 105 cells/mL and transfer to a suitable flask (e.g., a 175 cm2 flask). Transfer the flask to an incubator at 37 °C/5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: HEK293T cells should be thawed in advance in order to allow the cells to fully recover and to obtain a sufficient number of cells (11 x 107 cells are necessary for the production of one virus). It is recommended to use the cells after a minimum of three passages and to keep the cells below 20 passages. HEK293T cells should be split three times a week. While maintaining the cells, these should not exceed 70%-80% confluency. The DMEM used in the AAV preparation should also already be supplemented with L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate.\nCollect the cells in a 50 mL tube and centrifuge at 350 x g at RT for 5 min.\nSuspend the cells in 20 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% P/S, and 25 mM HEPES and count with a hemocytometer. Use trypan blue for dead cell exclusion.\nSeed 3 x 106 cells in 20 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% P/S, and 25 mM HEPES in a 175 cm2 flask. For the production of one virus, prepare at least four 175 cm2 flasks. Incubate the cells at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 3 days.\n\t\tNOTE: This step is best performed on a Friday as it allows the cells to expand during the weekend.\nHarvest and count the HEK293T cells.",
    "For the preparation of one of the viruses, prepare ten 150 mm dishes each containing 11 x 106 HEK293T in 20 mL of DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% P/S, and 25 mM HEPES.\nPlace the dishes in the incubator at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 24 h. Carefully discard the old medium and replace with 20 mL of antibiotic-free DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 25 mM HEPES, and 1 mM sodium butyrate. Before proceeding, check that the confluency of the cells is not above 80%.\nPrepare two 15 mL tubes that will contain the transfection mixes.To Tube 1, add 5 mL of reduced serum medium, 60 µg of rAAV6 mutated HDR plasmid, and 220 µg of pDGM6 (helper plasmid). To Tube 2, add 5 mL of reduced serum medium and 1120 µL of 1 mg/mL polyethylenimine solution (PEI, transfection reagent).\nAdd the contents of Tube 2 to Tube 1 and vortex for 30 s. Incubate for 15 min at RT to ensure proper encapsulation of the DNA into the PEI micelles.\n\t\tNOTE: Do not keep the solution for more than 20 min.\nCarefully add dropwise 1.1 mL of the solution to each dish and distribute by swirling gently. Place the dishes in the incubator at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 48 h.\nAfter 48 h, add 250 µL of 0.5 M EDTA to each dish and place the dishes in the incubator for 10 min. Harvest the cells by washing them off the dish and transfer to a 500 mL centrifuge tube or multiple 50 mL tubes.\nCentrifuge at 2,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Discard the supernatant. To ensure the complete removal of the supernatant, centrifuge again at 2,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C.",
    "Discard any remaining supernatant. Any residual supernatant could impair the virus purification.\nLoosen the pellet by vortexing and extract the virus by using an AAV purification kit (see Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Alternatively, perform extraction by iodixanol gradient ultracentrifugation30,31.\nAliquot the purified virus and store at −80 °C. Titrate the AAV functionally or quantify the AAV titer by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR)32 in order to determine the optimal transduction conditions.\nRepeat this process for the preparation of the rAAV6 WT HDR plasmid.\nAAV titration by ddPCR\n\t\nBefore starting, set the heating blocks at 65 °C and 98 °C.\nExtract viral DNA by adding 15 µL of DNA extraction solution to 5 µL of the virus. Vortex for 15 s.\nIncubate for 6 min at 65 °C. Vortex for 15 s. Incubate for 2 min at 98 °C.\nUse the extracted DNA (which is a 1:4 dilution of the viral DNA) to prepare serial dilutions (1:400, 1:40,000, 1:160,000, 1:640,000) with nuclease free (nf) H2O for the ddPCR.\n\t\tNOTE: The dilutions can be stored at −20 °C if the ddPCR will not be immediately performed.\nSelect three of the dilutions for the ddPCR. The choice of the dilution to use depends on the concentration of the virus. Preferably, use three different dilutions (e.g., 1:40,000, 1:160,000, and 1:640,000) to find the best dilution that is within the detection limit of the machine.\nKeep the reagents on ice while working. Prepare a master mix (all the samples will be measured in duplicates). For each reaction, prepare the following: 12.5 µL of ddPCR Supermix for Probes, no dUTP, 1.25 µL of PrimeTime Std qPCR Assay, AAV-ITR (see Table of Materials), and 6.25 µL nf-H2O.",
    "Mix 5 µL of DNA with 20 µL of the master mix. Perform this for the 1:40,000, 1:160,000, and 1:640,000 dilutions.\nPlace a cartridge in the cartridge holder. Add 70 µL of droplet generation oil to the probes in the row denominated as Oil. Be careful not to generate any bubbles.\nAdd 20 µL of the sample volume in the row denominated as Sample. Be careful not to generate any bubbles.\nSeal the cartridge with the gasket and place it in the droplet generator.

Open the software on the desktop.\nEnter the plate layout and select ABS in the experiment tab and ddPCR Supermix in the Supermix tab. Then, first press PRIME, followed by clicking FLUSH SYSTEM on the software to initiate the system.\nEnter the plate into the reader. Start the run and, when finished, export the data as a CSV file for subsequent analysis as a spreadsheet.\n\t\tNOTE: The numbers generated by the software are genome copies (GC) per µL. These need to be multiplied by the dilution factors: GC/µL x 5 (dilution of the DNA in the master mix) x initial dilution (i.e., 40,000 or 160,000).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/64558/64558fig03v2.jpg",
    "Figure 3: Schematic overview of intronic and exonic targeting during CRISPR/Cas9 HDR knock-in. Schematic comparison between intronic and exonic targeting strategies for CRISPR/Cas9 HDR knock-in. (A) During intronic targeting, a double-stranded break is introduced in an intron of the DNA. The HDR template is comprised of an LHA, cDNA sequence, and RHA. The intronic targeting requires, additionally, the presence of a slice acceptor containing the 3' splice site, branch point, and the polypyrimidine tract. This allows for correct splicing. The green dotted box represents the region corresponding to the SA sequence. The size of the SA is 150 bp. (B) Exonic targeting relies on the production of a double-stranded break directly in the exon. The HDR template is comprised of an LHA, cDNA sequence, and RHA. The orange dotted boxes indicate the regions corresponding to the LHA and RHA. The ideal size of the HAs is 400 bp each.
