In case of using a less common Cas nuclease, make sure the appropriate PAM sequences are selected.\nIn the “Sequence map” tab, select the region in which you want to design a gRNA. Then, in the “Design CRISPR” tab, click on the “+” symbol.\nSelect a gRNA with high “On-target” (Doench et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) and “Off-target” (Hsu et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) scores.\nNote: Scores above 60 are considered adequate.\nCloning of gRNAs. For each selected gRNA order two complementary oligos with different overhangs: a “forward” oligo with a cacc 5′ overhang and a “reverse” oligo with a aaac 5′ (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1747-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Example of how to design the gRNA\nThe “forward” primer should contain a cacc overhang (in this example: 5′ caccGGCTAGAATAGCTAGCTAGC 3′). The “reverse” primer should start with a aaac overhang (in this example 5′ aaacGCTAGCTAGCTATTCTAGCC 3′).\nNote: These overhangs are used to generate restriction sites for the BbsI enzyme, and different sequences should be added in case other restriction enzymes are used.\nOrder forward gRNA oligo with a 5′ cacc overhang.",
    "Order reverse gRNA oligo with a 5′ aaac overhang.\nMix 1 μL of each oligo (100 μM stock in TE) together with 8 μL of H2O (10 μL final volume). Anneal using the following conditions:\n5 min at 98°C.\nCool at 5°C/min rate down to 25°C.\nDilute reaction 1:200 in H2O. Annealed oligos can be stored at −20°C.\nPrepare the CRISPR-Cas9 vector.\nNote: CRISPR-Cas9 is used to generate a DSB at a specific site, which dramatically improves the insertion of a donor DNA template by HDR. To this purpose, a single guide RNA (gRNA) that can recognize a 20-nucleotide target sequence is expressed together with a Cas9 enzyme. Then, both the gRNA and Cas9 form a complex that specifically binds to the target site and generates a DSB. In this protocol, both the gRNA and Cas9 are transfected into cells and transiently expressed from the same plasmid.\nNote: A variety of CRISPR-Cas9 expressing vectors are available on Addgene. In this example, we used the px330A_hCas9_long_chimeric_gRNA_G2P vector, which is not listed on Addgene. This vector expresses hSpCas9; GFP fused by T2A to a puromycin-resistance gene; and the inserted gRNA (https://benchling.com/s/seq-sHYI3xBkQ3weqGOaQZDZ?m=slm-vUjeRzZzAmSvmf3h868G[href=https://benchling.com/s/seq-sHYI3xBkQ3weqGOaQZDZ?m=slm-vUjeRzZzAmSvmf3h868G]). Other vectors can be used, but it is important that they express an antibiotic resistance gene to select for positively transfected cells. We recommend puromycin resistance since it enables a more rapid selection in comparison with other antibiotics. For example, pSpCas9(BB)-2A-Puro (PX459) V2.0 from Addgene (Plasmid #62988).\nDigest vector for gRNA insertion with the corresponding restriction enzyme. For the px330A vector, we use BbsI.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1747_3.csv\nOvernight (from 12 to 24 h) at 37°C.\nRun the digested product in a 1.5% agarose gel.\nGel purify the linearized vector using a commercial kit (e.g., QIAquick PCR & Gel Cleanup Kit).\nLigate annealed oligos with CRISPR vector:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1747_4.csv\n30 min at 25°C.\nTransformation:",
    "Add 2.5 μL of the ligated reaction to 30 μL of chemically competent cells (NEB 5-Alpha).\nChill on ice.\nHeat-shock for 1 min at 37°C and then 1 min on ice.\nAdd 1 mL of LB and incubate 30 min at 37°C.\nPlate transformed bacteria on LB-ampicillin plates and incubate at 37°C overnight (12–20 h).\nPick a colony and grow overnight (12–20 h) at 37°C in 4 mL of LB-ampicillin.\nTake 1 mL of the culture and make a glycerol stock (20% glycerol + 80% LB-ampicillin) for long-term storage at −80°C.\nPurify the plasmid by performing a miniprep using 3 mL of the bacteria culture and a commercial kit of your choice (e.g., PureYield Plasmid Miniprep System; https://www.promega.es/resources/protocols/technical-bulletins/101/pureyield-plasmid-miniprep-system-protocol/[href=https://www.promega.es/resources/protocols/technical-bulletins/101/pureyield-plasmid-miniprep-system-protocol/]).\nQuantify the plasmid and verify the sequence by Sanger sequencing.\nDesign and cloning of donor template\nTiming: 10–15 days\nThis section describes how to design and clone the CRE that will be used as a donor template for the CRISPR-Cas9 knockin.\nNote: For obtaining the donor template, it is necessary to first clone each DNA fragment (enhancer and homology arms) into a donor plasmid and then amplify all of them together by PCR (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Alternatively, it is also possible to synthesize the enhancer with the HAs and restriction sites and then directly clone this into the donor plasmid.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1747-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Generation of donor template\nFirst, the HAs and the enhancer of interest are cloned into a donor plasmid using overlapping restriction enzymes. Then, the complete cassette is amplified by PCR and gel purified. The resulting dsDNA product is finally used to transfect the cells and to insert the candidate enhancer in the desired genomic locus by HDR. The red arrows correspond to the forward and reverse primers used to amplify the donor template.",
    "Note: To generate the donor template, we used a “donor vector” to separately insert the HAs and the enhancer sequence. Once all the elements are inserted in the vector, a PCR is performed to obtain a dsDNA with the enhancer sequence flanked by the two HAs. Since the donor vector will be only used as a PCR template to obtain the desired dsDNA, any vector with a multiple cloning cite (MCS) can be used. Importantly, the MCS should contain at least 4 different and compatible restriction enzyme sites. In this example, we used a simple vector that contains a MCS, a bacterial origin of replication and a kanamycin resistance gene under the EM7 promoter (https://benchling.com/s/seq-oEmdhAQmCYW2OsMVhtjh?m=slm-40wylnJzrZ4TzwErasYI[href=https://benchling.com/s/seq-oEmdhAQmCYW2OsMVhtjh?m=slm-40wylnJzrZ4TzwErasYI]). For the rest of the protocol, we will consider the restriction enzymes present in this vector, which are NdeI-SpeI-MluI-NotI (from 5′ to 3′).\nDesign primers for amplification of homology arms (HAs) and the enhancer of interest.\nDesign two sets of primers to amplify the left and right HAs from genomic DNA (gDNA). Each HA should be designed to cover approximately 300 bp flanking the site of integration (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1747-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Example of how to design the HAs\nHAs are amplified using primers flanking the gRNA recognition site. The right HA should extend from the cutting site (dashed line). The left HA should extend up to +1 from the cutting site.",
    "Critical: To improve the efficiency of the knockin by HDR, it is recommended to leave 1 bp between both HAs, preferentially the +1 position from the cutting site (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]) (Suzuki et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). In addition, each primer should contain a restriction site present in the multiple cloning site (MCS) of the donor plasmid (also with the same order). In this example, we used the primers “right HA fwd”, “right HA rev”, “left HA fwd” and “left HA rev” which are listed in the key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] with their respective restriction sites (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). In addition, order “donor template fwd” and “donor template rev” primers, which will be used for amplifying the donor template (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nDesign primers to amplify the enhancer of interest (“cloning_enhancer fwd” and “cloning_enhancer rev”). The forward primer should contain an overhang with the same restriction site as the “left HA reverse primer” and the reverse primer should contain the same restriction site as the “right HA forward primer”.\nCloning of HAs.\nAmplify left and right HAs with a high fidelity polymerase (e.g., Kapa Hifi or Q5; see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). Pure gDNA is preferred for this reaction (e.g., extracted with PureLink™ Genomic DNA Mini Kit). These are the conditions we used for the Kapa Hifi polymerase:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1747_5.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1747_6.csv\nVisualize the PCR product by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel and purify the band with a gel purification kit (e.g., QIAquick PCR & Gel Cleanup Kit).\nDigest overnight (12–24 h) at 37°C approximately 1 μg of each purified reaction with the chosen restriction enzymes. In our case, the left HA is typically digested with SpeI and NdeI; and the right HA with MluI and NotI.\nPurify the digested PCR products with a column PCR purification kit (e.g., QIAquick PCR & Gel Cleanup Kit).",
    "Prepare the donor vector.\nNote: The CRISPR-mediated DSB triggers the HDR process to mediate a strand-exchange process with the DNA repair template, which contains a homologous sequence of the target site and the desired cassette (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). Repair templates can be used in different flavors: plasmids, short circularized DNAs, double-stranded linearized DNA (dsDNA), single stranded DNA (ssDNA) and dsDNA with ssDNA overhangs (Dokshin et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Miura et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Suzuki et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]; Zhang et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]). In this method, we use a linearized dsDNA since, in our hands, it shows greater efficiency compared to the other donor types.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1747-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Inserting an enhancer into an endogenous locus via HDR\nThe CRISPR-Cas9 system is used to induce a DSB, which improves the insertion efficiency of a donor template with the enhancer of interest into a specific locus by HDR.\nNote: The homology arms (HAs) of the repair template should flank both sites of the integration cassette, since it improves the HDR rate (Suzuki et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). Therefore, the enhancer sequence of interest will be flanked by a left and right HA (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nDigest the donor vector with the first pair of restriction enzymes (i.e., NdeI-SpeI).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1747_7.csv\nOvernight (from 12 to 24 h) at 37°C.\nRun the digested product in a 1.5% agarose gel.\nGel purify the linearized vector using a commercial kit (e.g., QIAquick PCR & Gel Cleanup Kit).\nLigate the left HA into the digested donor plasmid:\nMix 200 ng or more of digested and purified left HA with 50 ng of the digested donor plasmid, 1 μL of ligase and 1× ligase buffer. Add H20 up to a final volume of 10 μL.\nIncubate 30 min at 25°C.",
    "Transform chemically competent cells as previously described (step 3.e), amplify and purify the vector using a miniprep kit (e.g., PureYield Plasmid Miniprep System) and Sanger sequence it to confirm that the left HA has been successfully cloned. For sequencing the generated plasmid you can use any forward primer located between 50 to 200 bp upstream of the left HA.\nLigate the right HA:\nDigest the donor plasmid containing the left HA with the restriction enzymes that correspond to the right HA (i.e., MluI and NotI).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1747_8.csv\nOvernight (from 12 to 24 h) at 37°C.\nRun the reaction in a 1.5% agarose gel and purify the band using a commercial kit.\nLigate the right HA as previously described for the left HA (Design and cloning of donor template: step 6.d).\nTransform chemically competent cells as previously described (step 3.e), amplify and purify the vector using a miniprep kit and sequence it to confirm that the right HA has been successfully cloned.\nDigest overnight (12–24 h) at 37°C 700 ng of the donor plasmid containing both HAs with the restriction enzymes corresponding to “left HA rev” and “right HA fwd” (i.e., SpeI and MluI).\nGel purify (e.g., QIAquick PCR & Gel Cleanup Kit) the digested plasmid and store at −20°C.\nCloning the enhancer of interest into the donor plasmid.\nSelect the enhancer sequence you want to study:\nAmplify the enhancer sequence with a high fidelity polymerase (e.g., Kapa HiFi or Q5) and primers “Cloning_enhancer fwd” and “Cloning_enhancer rev”.

We typically use Kapa Hifi polymerase in this step.\nVisualize the PCR product by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel and purify the band with a gel purification kit.\nCritical: Even though the PCR product is purified from the gel, the amplification of the donor template should not result in additional (unspecific) bands/products. The presence of unspecific bands might significantly affect the efficiency of subsequent integration events. If you see unspecific bands, try changing the conditions of the PCR (e.g., increasing the annealing temperature).\nTransfection, selection, and establishment of clonal cell lines\nTiming: 7 days\nThis section describes how to perform the knockin of CREs in mESC.\nNote: The donor template and the CRISPR-gRNA-expressing vector will be used to generate knockins of the enhancer of interest in the previously selected genomic site.\nTransfection of mESCs:",
    "Prepare a gelatin coated well (6 well plate (wp)) by adding 0.1% gelatin (just enough to cover the whole well) and incubate them 2 h at 37°C.\nThaw a frozen stock of mESC, centrifuge cells at 300 × g for 3 min, remove the supernatant and resuspend in 1 mL of mESC growth medium (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]).\nRemove gelatin from the gelatin-coated plate and add 2 mL of mESC growth medium. Then, plate the resuspended cells.\nGrow mESCs until approximately 80% confluent and prepare two gelatin-coated wells of a 12 wp (step 9.a).\nPrepare the transfection reaction by mixing 2.5 μL of HD fusion reagent (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) with 250 ng of CRISPR-gRNA vector (px330 vector with the cloned gRNA), 500 ng of donor template and 80 μL of OptiMEM.\nIncubate 15 min at 25°C.\nWhile incubating, trypsinize cells with 500 μL trypsin (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]) and plate a 1/20 dilution into two gelatin-coated wells of a 12wp (step 9.a) with 400 μL of mESC growing medium.\nOnce the 15 min incubation time finishes, add the transfection reaction into one of the wells. The other well should remain as a non-transfected control.\nIncubate at 37°C overnight (12–24 h).\nNote: For increasing efficiency, the transfection is performed as the cells are split.\nSelect transfected cells.\nThe transfection efficiency can be initially evaluated by visualizing the number of GFP positive cells in the transfected population. For an optimal transfection efficiency, you should see at approximately 80% of GFP positive cells. If you are using a CRISPR plasmid without GFP, this step can be omitted.\nChange medium in both wells (transfected and negative control). The medium should contain 1.7 μg/mL of puromycin.",
    "Note: This concentration is the optimal for selecting transfected cells in 48 h, but you could increase or decrease the concentration if the negative control is not dying or the negative control dies before 48 h, respectively.\nIncubate cells at 37°C until all the cells in the non-transfected well are dead (dead cells detach from the well surface). This should take approximately 48 h.\nGrow the transfected cell population in mESC medium without puromycin until confluent.\nNote: This will take between 3 and 6 days depending on the initial transfection efficiency.\nTrypsinize the cell population with 250 μL of trypsin (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), inactivate with 500 μL of mESC growth medium and split in half: plate half of the cells in a gelatin-coated well of a 12 well plate (step 9.a) and the other half in a 1.5 mL tube.\nExtract gDNA from the 1.5 mL tube:\nSpin down cells at 300 × g for 3 min (25°C) and remove supernatant.\nResuspend cells in 25 μL of gDNA extraction buffer (50 mM KCl, 10 mM TRIS pH 8.3, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.45% NP40, 0.45% Tween 20).\nAdd 1 μL of 20 μg/mL of Proteinase K.\nIncubate 5 min at 65°C.\nIncubate 1 min at 98°C.\nDilute 1:2 with H2O.\nMeasure concentration with Nanodrop.\nScreen for the presence of the desired knockin in the population by PCR genotyping.\nPerform PCR reactions with primer pairs that either flank the homology arms or are located within the inserted enhancer (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1747-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Primers used for PCR-based genotyping of transfected cells",
    "Combination of P1+P3 and P4+P2 should only amplify a product if the desired insertion is present in the transfected cell population, but no product should be detected using WT gDNA. Primers P1+P2 should amplify a large and a short product corresponding to the inserted and WT alleles, respectively. In WT cells, primers P1+P2 should only amplify the short product. In the transfected cell population, both products should be ideally observed. However, only the short product is often observed in the transfected cells as it is preferentially amplified over the larger one.\nNote: Ideally, PCR products should be in the range of 300–700 bp. Use gDNA from the transfected population and the GoTaq polymerase (M7123 Promega) with the following conditions:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1747_12.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1747_13.csv\nVisualize the PCR products by electrophoresis in an agarose gel to determine whether the desired insertion can be detected within the transfected cell population.\nNote: That primers P1+P2 might only amplify a product corresponding to the WT allele even if the insertion is present in the population due to the smaller size of the WT product (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]).\nSingle cell seeding.\nGrow the transfected population until it is confluent.\nTrypsinize the transfected population with 250 μL trypsin, inactivate with mESC growth medium and split into three 1.5 mL tubes.\nTwo tubes should be used for freezing the population in cryovials.\nNote: This can be used as a backup if you encounter any problem in the following steps and you need to perform a new single cell seeding.\nSpin down cells at 300 × g for 3 min.\nResuspend in 1 mL of Freezing medium (30% FBS + 20% DMSO + 50% mESC growth medium).\nSave at −150°C.",
    "Pause point: Alternatively, you can freeze the three tubes of cells and store them at −150°C until the next step is planned and started.\nThe other tube is used to seed single cells in two full gelatin-coated 96wp (as step 9.a):\nDilute the cells 1:3 with medium and count the cells with a cell counter (we use TC20 Automatic cell counter from Bio-Rad).\nCritical: The cellular density should be between 5 × 105 and 2 × 106 (if the density is higher, dilute with medium and count again).\nMake serial dilutions to obtain a cellular density of approximately 150 cells in 20 mL.\nCritical: Cell counting is only performed in the previous step. As a recommendation, perform 5 serial dilutions until obtaining the desired cellular density.\nNote: As an example, if your initial count was 1 × 106: transfer 200 μL of the counted cells in 2.8 mL medium (this will be your dilution 1 and you would have 6,666 × 104 cells/mL). Then, transfer 500 μL of dilution 1 in 4.5 mL medium (this will be your dilution 2 and you would have 6666 cells/mL). Transfer 500 μL of dilution 2 in 4.5 mL medium (this will be your dilution 3 and you would have approx. 666 cells/mL). Transfer 1 mL of dilution 3 in 4 mL medium (this will be your dilution 4 and you would have approx. 133 cells/mL). Transfer X in final volume 20 mL (dilution 5). X should be calculated according to the initial cell count. In this example, X= (150 cells / 130 cells/mL) × 1 mL = 1.13 mL.\nUse the final dilution (150 cells in 20 mL) to plate 100 μL in each of the wells of two 96 wp.\nIncubate both plates at 37°C.\nScreening for clones with the insertion",
