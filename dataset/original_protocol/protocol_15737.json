    "Experiments were conducted strictly in accordance with the ARRIVE guidelines and the National Institutes of Health guide for the care and use of Laboratory animals, and adhere to the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in Wenzhou Medical University (WMU) and Joinn Laboratory (Suzhou). The male Saanen goats, aged from 4 to 6 months with weight of 19-23 kg, were housed in the WMU animal facility. The male Rhesus macaques, aged from 5 to 6 years with weight of 5-7 kg, were housed in the Joinn animal facility. All the animals were maintained in an air-conditioned room with controlled temperature (21 ± 2 °C) under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle with food ad libitum.\n1. Flash visual evoked potential (FVEP) in goat\nGeneral anesthetization\n\t\nShave the hock hair with an electronic razor.\nPrepare the skin by rubbing with 70% alcohol three times to clean the skin, and then expose the subcutaneous vein.\nInsert a peripheral venous catheter intravenously (0.9 mm x 25 mm), and then inject atropine (0.025 mg/kg) and propofol (5 mg/kg).\nIntubate the goat with a 6 mm tracheal tube and connect it to an artificial respirator.\nMaintain anesthesia with 3.5% isoflurane in oxygen at a constant flow rate of 2 L/min.\n\t\tNOTE: The goat recovers from the anesthesia induced by propofol within minutes, so be fast to intubate the goat.\nCardiopulmonary monitoring\n\t\nPlace the temperature sensor beneath the tongue.\nConnect the pulse oximeter to the proximal end of the ear.\nTie the blood pressure cuff to the base of the thigh.\nClamp the ECG clips onto the limbs accordingly.",
    "NOTE: The normal heart rate of goats is 68-150 bpm. Due to the use of gas anesthesia, the heart rate of goats will increase. Therefore, our heart rate during inspection is 170 ± 30 bpm. The systolic blood pressure of goats under normal conditions is 110-130 mmHg, and the diastolic blood pressure is 50-60 mmHg. In the state of inhaling oxygen, the goat's blood oxygen saturation can always be maintained at 99%. The breathing rate of goats under anesthesia is synchronized with that of the ventilator, which is 10 breaths/min. Since the temperature was measured from under the tongue of the goat, not the core temperature, the temperature of the goat is generally 35 ± 2 °C.\nSkull screws implantation and electrodes placement\n\t\nShave the hair with a clipper. Disinfect the skin on the center of the frontal bone by rubbing with a cotton ball soaked in betadine and 70% alcohol three times.\nUse sterilized screws and scissors.\n\t\tNOTE: Autoclave all surgical instruments for sterilization (121 °C, 20 min).\nMake a 5 mm skin incision to expose the frontal bone with an ophthalmic scissor, and then implant a sterilized screw at the center of the frontal bone using a screwdriver.\nShave the hair and disinfect the skin on the central occipital bone between two ears with betadine and 70% alcohol, one followed by the other, three times.\nMake a 5 mm skin incision to expose the occipital bone with an ophthalmic scissor, and then implant a sterilized screw at the center of the occipital bone.\n\t\tNOTE: The ground needle electrode is inserted subcutaneously beneath the frontal skull screw. The active and reference electrodes are connected to the occipital and frontal screws, respectively, with alligator clips to reduce the electrode impedance16.\nAnimal preparation",
    "Use lightproof cloth to cover the eye and fix by the blindfold to patch one eye.\nApply topical anesthetic eyedrops (proparacaine hydrochloride eyedrops) onto both eyes. Bilateral pupils are dilated by topical administration of mydriatic eyedrops with tropicamide (5%) and phenylephrine (5%).\nPlace the head of the goat into the Ganzfeld stimulator and dim the ambient light.\n\t\tNOTE: It was found that goats can maintain good eyeball fixation under anesthesia, so no extra eyeball fixation operation intervention is required.\nCover the stimulator and the goat's head with a black blanket for 5 min for adaptation.\nUse eyelid speculum to expose the bulbar conjunctiva. Fold the upper ring, pull the upper eyelid up, and insert the upper ring first into the conjunctival sac of the upper eyelid and then into the lower eyelid in a similar manner.\nPress the Impedance button to check the electrode-tissue contact impedance and the values of impedance will be shown in each channel.\nEnsure that the impedance is below 10 kΩ for each electrode to avoid electromagnetic interference from other electrical devices in the same room.\n\t\tNOTE: If it is above 10 kΩ, reconnect or replace the electrode. The impedance may appear abnormally high if the electrical metal surgical bed, where the goat lies, is plugged. The impedance should differ by less than 1 kΩ between the active and reference electrodes to reduce electrical interference17.\nPress the Oscillograph button to check the baseline noise without light stimulation.\n\t\tNOTE: If there is a large baseline noise, unplug all other electrical devices in the same room and turn off cell phones. If the baseline problem persists, jump to step 1.3.10. to check if a typical FVEP waveform can be elicited. If not, reschedule the FVEP test at another time.",
    "Start FVEP recording by choosing the light intensity of 0.025, 0.5, and 3.0 cd·s/m2, respectively in the white background box in the upper-right corner. Then, press the Examination button. Note that FVEP recording at each light intensity is performed twice.\n\t\tNOTE: If the two waveforms appear obviously different, one more repeat is needed.\nMoist the cornea with artificial tear eyedrops, if it appears dry on the infrared camera.\n\t\tNOTE: Monitor the eye position from the incorporated infrared camera before recording to make sure that the visual gaze is correct and the pupil is fully exposed (so that the field size of a flash stimulus is 90°. The eye position of an anesthetized goat can be adjusted by turning its head accordingly. Based on our observation, gaze wandering rarely occurs during FVEP recording (~10 min) in goat under general anesthesia9. So there is no need to pause and re-adjust the gaze while recording.\nRepeat the above steps for the contralateral eye.\nCease isoflurane supply and increase the tidal volume slightly on the ventilator to help the goat recover from general anesthesia.\nAfter general anesthesia, treat the goat with gentamicin (4 mg/kg, IM) and ceftiofur sodium (a cephalosporin, 2 mg/kg, IM) to prevent infection.\nFVEP measurement and quantitative analysis\n\tNOTE: As shown in Figure 1A, the first positive and negative peaks in the FVEP waveform are designated as P1 and N1, and the second positive peak as P2. The typical implicit time of P1, N1, and P2 are around 40, 60, and 120 ms, respectively. P1 and P2 amplitudes are measured from the trough of N1 waveform to the peaks of P1 and P2 waveforms, respectively.\n\t\nIn case of monocular injury, use interocular comparison of amplitude and implicit time to help reduce intersession variation and increase sensitivity17.\n2. PVEP in rhesus macaque",
    "NOTE: Pattern VEPs could be elicited in rhesus macaques9 and are more stable than Flash VEP in amplitude and implicit time17. Therefore, PVEP was used to detect the integrity of the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway in non-human primates.\nAnimal preparation\n\t\nAnesthetize the monkey with isoflurane (1.5%-2%) after induction with Zoletil50 (4-8 mg/kg IM, tiletamine/zolazepam).\nPosition the sterilized ground electrode at the earlobe. Insert the sterilized active and reference electrodes subcutaneously along the midline at the frontal and occipital bone, respectively.\nApply eyelid speculum to expose the bulbar conjunctiva.\nUse adhesive opaque black tape to patch the contralateral eye.\nPVEP recording\n\t\nPress the Impedance button to check the electrode-tissue contact impedance and the values of impedance will be shown in each channel; ensure that it is below 10k Ω. If not, reconnect or replace the electrode.\nCheck the values of impedance in Impedance Test Window and ensure that the impedance differ by less than 1 kΩ between the active and reference electrodes to reduce electrical interference17.\nPress the Oscillograph button to check the baseline noise without stimulation.\n\t\tNOTE: If there is a large baseline noise, unplug all other electrical devices in the same room and turn off the cell phones. If the baseline problem persists, redo the PVEP test on another day.\nRecord PVEP responses of the unpatched eye by choosing the light intensity of 0.5 and 1.0 cycle/degree, respectively in the white background box in the upper-right corner, and then press the Examination button.\n\t\tNOTE: For each recording, 64 traces are averaged to yield one waveform. For each frequency, a minimal of two recordings are acquired to verify the reproducibility of PVEP signals.\nRepeat the procedure for the contralateral eye.\nOnce done, cease isoflurane supply to awake the monkey.",
    "After general anesthesia, treat the monkey with gentamicin (4 mg/kg IM) and ceftiofur sodium (2 mg/kg IM) to prevent infection.\nPVEP measurement and quantitative analysis\n\t\nAs shown in Figure 1B, the first negative and positive peaks in the PVEP waveform were designated as N1 and P1, which typically occur at around 50 and 90 ms. The P1 amplitude is measured from the trough of N1 to the peak of P1.\nIn case of monocular injury, use interocular comparison of amplitude and implicit time to help reduce intersession variation and to increase sensitivity17.\n3. Pattern ERG (PERG) in goat\nNOTE: In the previous study, no interocular crosstalk of PERG signal was observed in goats, so PERG responses can be recorded simultaneously from both eyes9.\nExamination preparation\n\t\nAnesthetize the goat using xylazine (3 mg/kg, IM), and place on an exam table.\nPlace a temperature sensor under the goat's tongue.\nConnect the pulse oximeter to the proximal end of the goat's ear.\nTie the blood pressure cuff to the thigh.\nClamp the ECG clips on the limbs accordingly.\nTo reduce electrode impedance, place a sterilized skull screw on the frontal bone and connect to the ground electrode with an alligator clip.\nPlace two sterilized needle reference electrodes subcutaneously 1 cm behind the lateral canthi on both sides.\nUse the eyelid speculum to expose the bulbar conjunctiva.\nPlace two disinfected ERG-Jet recording electrodes at the center of bilateral corneas after topical application of artificial tear.\nPlace two 47.6 cm x 26.8 cm LED monitors in front of both the eyes with a viewing distance of 50 cm.\nAdjust each monitor to be parallel to the pupil plane on the same side and align the center of the monitor to the pupil plane.",
    "Ensure that the contrast-reversing checkerboard (temporal frequency, 2.4 Hz) is displayed on both the monitors and has a maximal aspect ratio of 4:3, which is set by equipment settings.\nEnsure that the contrast between white and black checkers remains 96%, and the mean luminance is 200 cd/m2 (Candela per square metre), which is checked by the luminance meter.\n\t\tNOTE: According to ISCEV, a mean photopic luminance of 40-60 cd/m2 is required in humans17. In another study using mice model, the pattern remained at a mean luminance of 800 cd/m2,18. A field size of at least 15° in its narrowest dimension is needed for a standard PERG test in humans17. Adjust the position of corneal electrode if it is not at the center of the corneal surface.\nPERG recording\n\t\nDim the ambient light and press the Impedance button to check the electrode-tissue contact impedance. The values of impedance will be shown in each channel.\nCheck the values of impedance in Impedance Test Window and ensure that impedance is below 10 kΩ. If not, reconnect or replace the electrode.\nPress the Oscillograph button to check the baseline noise without light stimulation.\n\t\tNOTE: Pay attention to protect the fragile ERG-Jet recording electrodes. Baseline noise in PERG is usually smaller than that in FVEP in goat.\nStart PERG recording from both eyes simultaneously at the spatial frequencies of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 12.6 cycles/degree consecutively. For each spatial frequency, 64 traces are averaged to yield one readout.\nFinally, turn off the monitor to record PERG without visual stimulus as a negative control.\n\t\tNOTE: PERG signals are usually stable and don't need repeat.\nRemove the front skull screw and awake the goat by injecting Idzoxan (1.5 mg/kg), which is a xylazine antagonist.",
    "After general anesthesia, treat the goat with gentamicin (4 mg/kg IM) and ceftiofur sodium (2 mg/kg IM) to prevent infection.\nPERG measurement and quantitative analysis\n\t\nSet the bandpass filter to range from 1 to 75 Hz. For 3.0 cpd PERG, the bandpass filter is set to be from 1 to 50 Hz to smoothen the trace without affecting its amplitude.\nAs shown in Figure 1C, the first positive and negative peaks in the waveform are designated as P1 (typically around 25 ms) and N1 (typically around 55 ms). The PERG amplitude is measured from N1 to P1.\nIn case of monocular injury, we use interocular comparison of amplitude and implicit time to help reduce intersession variation and reduce sensitivity17.\n4. PERG in rhesus macaque\nNOTE: It is unclear if there is interocular crosstalk of PERG signal in rhesus macaque, so PERG responses from both eyes are recorded separately.\nExamination preparation\n\t\nAnesthetize the monkey with isoflurane (1.5%-2%) after injection of Zoletil50 (4-8 mg/kg IM, tiletamine/zolazepam) and tracheal intubation.\nPlace a sterilized ground electrode subcutaneously on the frontal bone. Insert a sterilized needle reference electrode subcutaneously, 1 cm behind the lateral canthus on the same side.\nPlace a disinfected ERG-Jet recording electrode on the central cornea after topical application of artificial tear.\n\t\tNOTE: Adjust the position of corneal electrode, if it is not at the center of the corneal surface.\nUse adhesive opaque black tape to patch one eye.\nPlace a monitor (47.6 x 26.8 cm) at a viewing distance of 50 cm.\nEnsure that the monitor is adjusted to be parallel to the pupil plane. Align the center of the monitor to the pupil plane.",
    "Ensure that the black and white checkerboard is reversing at a frequency of 2.4 Hz, and the aspect ratio is 4:3, which is set by equipment settings.\nEnsure that the contrast between the white and black checkers is 96%, and the averaged luminance remains 200 cd/m2, which is checked by luminance meter.\nPERG recording\n\t\nDim the ambient light and check the electrode-tissue contact impedance.\nEnsure that impedance is below 10 kΩ. If not, reconnect or replace the electrode.\nCheck the baseline noise without light stimulation.\nPatch one eye and start PERG recording from the other eye at spatial frequencies of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, and 12.6 cycles/degree consecutively.\nRepeat the steps 4.2.1-4.2.4 for the contralateral eye.\nCease isoflurane supply to awaken the monkey.\nAfter general anesthesia, treat the monkey with gentamicin (4mg/kg IM) and ceftiofur sodium (2 mg/kg IM) to prevent infection.\nPERG measurement and quantitative analysis\n\t\nAs shown in Figure 1D, the first positive and negative peaks in the waveform are designated as P1 (typically around 40ms) and N1 (typically around 85 ms). The PERG amplitude is measured from N1 to P1.\nIn case of monocular injury, we use interocular comparison of amplitude and implicit time to help reduce intersession variation and increase sensitivity17.\n5. OCT in goat\nAnimal preparation\n\t\nAnesthetize the goat using xylazine (3mg/kg, IM), and then intubate.\nDilate the pupil by topical administration of mydriatic eyedrops with tropicamide (5%) and phenylephrine (5%).\nUse the eyelid speculum to fully expose the pupil.\nPlace the head of the goat on the chin rest.\n\t\tNOTE: Although gas anesthetization is not performed, intubate the goat regularly to protect the airway from being compressed by the chin rest.\nOCT imaging",
    "NOTE: The retinal OCT imaging is performed using the OCT system at a wavelength of 870 nm in this study. The optical axial resolution of the OCT scanner is 12 µm. Circular scan mode is used to scan the optic nerve head (ONH) with high-resolution mode. 100 frames are averaged to optimize the image quality. The detailed training guide is available online (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nInitial OCT scanning (baseline exam)\n\t\t\nClick on the Start button to enter the detection interface. Wait for the machine to finish loading, and then press the yellow Start button to initiate imaging.\nAlign the goat with the infrared camera to center the ONH in the confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (cSLO) image by modifying its head position.\nAdjust the joystick to evenly illuminate the entire infrared image to improve image quality.\nMove the joystick forward until an upright retinal OCT image is showed on the upright screen.\nModify the joystick to have an evenly dense and horizontally placed retinal OCT image.\nPress the button on the joystick to catch the image automatically and hold the joystick to maintain the image quality on the live image screen until image acquisition is completed. Then, press Acquire.\nAwaken the goat by injecting Idzoxan (1.5 mg/kg), which is a xylazine antagonist.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Centering the ONH in the baseline exam helps align the baseline scan and follow-up scan according to our experience.\nFollow-up OCT scanning\n\t\t\nSelect a high-quality initial OCT image; right-click and select Set Reference.\nInitiate OCT imaging as mentioned above.\nPress the Follow-up button to allow automatic match of the current scan to the reference scan.\nOnce matched (the circular scan ring turns green), press the button on the joystick to activate Automatic Real-time Tracking.",
    "Awaken the goat by injecting Idzoxan (1.5 mg/kg ), which is a xylazine antagonist.\n\t\t\tNOTE: To facilitate the process of matching, (1) move the ONH in the live window by turning the head accordingly or (2) rotate the ONH in the live window by tilting the head to make the current cSLO image appear more similar to the baseline image. This vestibulo-ocular reflex works well under xylazine anesthesia19.\nOCT measurement\n\t\nClick on the Measurement button to enter the measurement window.\nChoose the eraser tool and wipe the RNFL line, which is automatically labeled by the program.\nChoose the Line Drawing tool to manually outline the boundary between IPL and INL (Figure 2).\n\t\tNOTE: GCC thickness in six peripapillary regions (T, TS, TI, N, NS, NI) and averaged GCC thickness around the ONH (G) can be read on the screen (Figure 2). The student test, one-way ANOVA or two-way ANOVA can be used to quantify the OCT data in case of normal distribution.\n6. OCT in rhesus macaque\nPerform retinal OCT imaging in rhesus macaque using the same equipment and procedure as done in the case of goat.\nSubscription Required.
