    "The recording of the surgical procedure and the use of its content for scientific and educational reasons were explained to the patient; he then signed a consent form, according to the Institution's human ethics committee. Written informed consent for the surgical and anesthetic procedures was also obtained.\nNOTE: Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of achalasia by manometry and barium esophagram findings can be included in the protocol for robotic myotomy and partial fundoplication. A preoperative pre-anesthesia evaluation was performed, and patients with increased surgical risk were excluded. Patients who failed to meet the diagnostic criteria of achalasia and/or presented other esophageal motility disorders were excluded. Failure to sign both anesthetic and surgical forms also implied exclusion.\n1. Operative setting and trocar placement\nOnce under general anesthesia, place the patient in a supine position.\nCreate a pneumoperitoneum using a Veress needle. Insert the needle above the umbilical scar.\nUse four 8 mm robotic trocars, one 12 mm trocar and one 5 mm trocar in this procedure. Place the 12 mm trocar in the supraumbilical area, left to the midline, for the robotic camera system. This positioning allows better visualization of the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ).\nPlace the remaining trocars along a straight line above the umbilicus: two 8 mm trocars, one at the left and one at the right midclavicular line subcostal margin, and the remaining two trocars at the left and right lateral abdominal walls (Figure 4). A 5 mm trocar is placed in a subxiphoid position and then replaced by a Nathanson liver retractor.\n2. Dissection of the lower esophagus and division of the short gastric vessels\nPlace a Nathanson liver retractor in a subxiphoid position in order to elevate the left lobe of the liver.",
    "Start the operation by dividing the short gastric vessels, starting from the middle of the great curvature of the stomach all the way to the angle of His.\nPerform full mobilization of the gastric fundus, using an ultrasonic harmonic scalpel to free it from the retroperitoneum while an atraumatic grasper retracts the stomach.\nDivide the gastrohepatic ligament - below the hepatic branch of the vagus - and progressively dissect it in order to identify and expose both diaphragmatic crura.\nPlace tape around the esophagus, allowing gentle traction.\nProceed with the isolation of the esophagus by separating it from the left and right crura by blunt dissection. During the dissection, identify and preserve the posterior and anterior vagal trunks and both pleurae. The anterior vagal trunk is adhered to or embedded in the esophageal wall, and the posterior trunk lies on a layer of adipose tissue posterior to the esophagus.\nMobilize the esophagus circumferentially, creating a longer intra-abdominal esophagus.\n3. Heller myotomy\nRemove the fat pad by holding the adipose tissue that lies above the pharyngoesophageal ligament and separate it circumferentially from the esophagus wall with a harmonic scalpel in order to expose and better visualize the gastroesophageal junction.\nBefore performing the myotomy, mark the esophageal wall with the bipolar forceps in the anterior midline of the esophagus, with an extension approximately 6 cm above the gastroesophageal junction.\nGrasp the borders of the myotomy and disrupt the muscular layer while moving the borders away from each other until exposure of the submucosal layer.\nProceed with the myotomy with the harmonic scalpel by interposing the inactive jaw of the scalpel between the submucosal (pinkish) and muscular layers (whitish) and activating the trigger in order to cut and cauterize.",
    "During this dissection, make sure to separate the muscle edges of the myotomy laterally, thus avoiding it to fuse when healing. Use a sterile measuring stripe to ensure the length of the myotomy is 6 cm above the gastroesophageal junction and 3 cm below it.\nContinue the demarcation and myotomy below the gastroesophageal junction laterally into the stomach as the muscle fibers change direction from circular to oblique. Adequate extension of myotomy is crucial to achieve good postoperative results and avoid the recurrence of dysphagia.\n4. Creation of the partial fundoplication\nPerform the repair of the hiatus with the figure of eight stitches, with 2.0 cotton sutures, although silk or polyester sutures may also be suitable options. Be aware not to tighten the hiatus, which may lead to postoperative dysphagia.\nProceed with the Heller Pinotti fundoplication. That technique involves creating an anterior-lateral-posterior fundoplication using three suture lines to connect the gastric fundus and esophagus.\nMobilize the gastric fundus and bring it around the back of the esophagus in order to perform the suturing of the gastric fundus to the posterior wall of the distal esophagus.\nPerform interrupted stitches with 2-0 cotton sutures, and attach the seromuscular layer of the stomach to the muscular layer of the esophagus. The extension of the suture should correspond to that of the myotomy; usually 2-3 stitches are enough. The first stitch of that row should also incorporate the hiatus. Although this maneuver does not prevent the migration of the valve, it restrains its rotation.\nResect a muscular strip over the gastroesophageal junction, when needed.\nNext, perform the second row of sutures from the gastric fundus to the left edge of the myotomy. As with the first row, the initial stitch should also be attached to the hiatus.",
    "Perform the third and last row of sutures from the gastric fundus to the right edge of the myotomy. By the end of these steps, the exposed submucosa of the esophagus should be covered by gastric serosa.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
