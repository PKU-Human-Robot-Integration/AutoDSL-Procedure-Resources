    "Seed 10 cm dishes with 3 x 106 293T cells in 8 ml of complete DMEM. For this assay, we typically use at least 2 dishes per condition.Allow the cells to grow at 37 °C in 5% CO2 until they reach 70-80% confluence, this should take approximately 24 h.Transfect viral plasmid(s) of interest. For M-MLV, we typically use 10 μg of plasmid DNA, though this may be optimized based on the virus (Note 1).Return the cells to the incubator for virus production for a period of 72 h (Note 2).Before collecting the viral supernatant, pre-cool the ultracentrifuge to 4 °C.Collect the viral supernatant (roughly 15 ml) using a serological pipette, and transfer it into a 50 ml conical tube.Centrifuge this supernatant for 5 min at 500 x g to clear cellular debris.During this centrifugation step, prepare the appropriate number of syringes and 450 nm filters.Transfer the cleared supernatant into a syringe and filter it directly into a Type 70Ti tube.Top up each tube with media or PBS such that they contain approximately 5.5 ml below the maximum threshold.Place a sterile Pasteur pipette into each 70Ti tube, with the thin side immersed in viral media. Refer to Figure 2.Slowly add the sterile 20% sucrose solution through the Pasteur pipette so it may form a cushioning layer below the viral supernatant. Five milliliters of this solution is sufficient (Note 3). Refer to Figure 2.Balance each tube appropriately for ultracentrifugation. Sterile media or PBS can be used to adjust the mass of viral samples.Cap each tube, ensuring the O-rings and aluminum caps are sealed properly. Insert these tubes appropriately into the Type 70Ti rotor and insert the rotor into the ultracentrifuge (Note 3).",
    "Ultracentrifuge these samples with an acceleration and deceleration set to 50%, for 3 h at 4 °C at 100,000 x g (Note 4).Remove the tubes from the rotor, visualize the pellets and circle with a marker. As time passes after the centrifugation, these become more difficult to see so you need to proceed as fast as possible. Refer to Figure 2.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829193149_3449.jpgFigure 2. Virus concentration by ultracentrifugation. A Pasteur pipette (A) is used to add a distinct underlayer of sucrose (B). After ultracentrifugation, the pellet is visualized and identified with a marker (C).Gently remove supernatants using a serological pipette and resuspend the pellet in 1 ml of PBS (Note 4).Incubate this concentrated viral sample with an excess of antibody-conjugated beads (we used 30 μl) targeting a surface antigen (i.e., anti-GFP) for 3 h at 4 °C with constant gentle rotation.Using the μMACs system (Note 5), ready the μ-columns on the MultiStand.Add PBS to prime the column prior to sample addition (Note 6).Load the viral sample into a μ-column and allow PBS to flow through the column by gravity. Flow through from this stage can be collected for analysis with the enriched portion. Refer to Figure 3.Wash the column with 5x volume of sterile PBS (5 ml for each 1 ml of virus).Elute from the column as desired. Miltenyi describes multiple conditions for elution, both denaturing and non-denaturing. In our case, we desired to reduce non-specific elution and maintain viral integrity. To achieve this, remove the column from the magnetic stand, insert it into a microcentrifuge tube and add 250 μl of sterile PBS to the column, which is collected in the tube. The eluate will also contain the magnetic beads, so it will be a translucent brown colour as shown in Figure 3.",
    "Samples can be stored short-term (< 1 day) at 4 °C, and long-term (weeks) at -80 °C.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180829/20180829193207_8101.jpgFigure 3. μMACS isolation of intact viruses and gentle elution. A μ-column is securely fit into the separator on the magnetic stand and a microcentrifuge tube can be placed below to collect flow through (A). Removal of the μ-column from the magnetic field (B) will enable mobility of the magnetic beads in any desired elution buffer. The beads will also elute from the column, giving the eluate a translucent brown colour (C)."
