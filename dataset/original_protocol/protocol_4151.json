    "Enzyme preparation and storageEnzyme was overexpressed using E. coli Rosetta 2 (DE3) cell line and the pET overexpression system, His-tag and Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography [for specifics, please see Goodlett et al. (1995)].After chromatography and buffer exchange, the enzyme was divided into 50 μl aliquots and was snap-frozen before long-term storage at -80 °C.Enzyme assaysEnzyme reactions were performed in 2 ml microfuge tubes.199 μl of AA solution in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) plus cofactors (if needed) were placed in each reaction tube.20 μM pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP) was added based on bioinformatic evidence that the enzyme has a PLP-binding motif.To pre-condition the assay solution, the assay tubes were kept at 37 °C for 5 min before enzyme addition.Assay was initiated by the addition of the purified enzyme to a final volume of 200 μl.The final enzyme concentration was determined empirically and varied based on the particular substrate used. In our case, between 1 μM and 2 μM final enzyme concentrations were used to determine relative substrate specificity, and between 1 nM and 2 μM - to calculate the enzyme kinetics. For further specifics, please see Goodlett et al. (1995). The molar concentration of enzyme used was kept at 10% or less of the initial substrate concentration.Assay was performed at 37 °C for 1 min.The assay duration was chosen so that only 10% or less of the initial substrate was consumed in order to minimize the occurrence of the reverse reaction.To quench the assay, 40 μl of 2 M HCl was added and mixed by pipetting.In preparation for derivatization, 40 μl 2 M NaOH was added to neutralize the acid.50 μl of the neutralized, quenched assay was transferred to a new 2 ml microfuge tube.100 μl of 0.5% Marfey’s reagent in acetone was added.",
    "20 μl of 1 M NaHCO3 was added to make the solution alkaline, and the contents were mixed via pipetting.Derivatization was performed on a heat block at 40 °C for 1 h.During this time, fresh 1 L HPLC buffer was prepared and passed through 0.22 μm bottle top filter every time before sample analysis.Also, 900 μl of 80% 0.05 M TEAP buffer (pH 3.0) and 20% acetonitrile (HPLC grade) was placed in new 2 ml microfuge tubes in preparation for the 10-fold dilution of the derivatized products.Derivatization reaction was briefly centrifuged to collect any condensation from the lid of the microfuge tube.Reaction was cooled at room temperature for 5 min.100 μl of the reaction was mixed with the solution in step B11b to prepare a 10-fold dilution.The diluted derivatization reaction was passed through a PTFE 0.22 μm syringe filter and placed into an amber HPLC vial.Derivatization reactions should be kept in an amber vial to prevent photochemical decomposition of the absorbing chromophore (Marfey, 1984). In our case, assays were analyzed within 48 h after derivatization. The same procedure as above was followed (the enzyme addition was omitted.) to determine AA elution times and prepare standard curves. HPLC analysisThe specific column employed in our case was Waters Nova-Pak, C18 column.10 μl of the diluted derivatized reaction (from step B15) was analyzed.Flow rate was 0.5 ml/min.Derivatized products were detected at 340 nm.Several gradients were employed for the separation of different enantiomeric pairs.For a description of the gradients, please refer to the methods section and supplementary material of the original publication by Radkov and Moe (2013).Data analysisDue to differences in the derivatization efficiency between enantiomeric pairs, derivatized D-AAs yield a higher UV response relative to L-AAs. The data provided by Goodlett et al.",
    "was used to adjust for these differences before preparing standard curves and calculating specific activities.Example chromatogramimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140426/20140426232917_9898.jpgThe Solver function in Microsoft Excel was used to perform non-linear curve fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation.An example dataset (attached here[href=https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20140505/20140505182857_7383.xlsx]) is provided as a supplementary file."
