    "The institutional animal care and use committees of Academia Sinica and Taipei Medical University approved this protocol for the use of experimental animals.\n1. MCAO/reperfusion model\nProvide the mice with free access to water and chow until the surgery.\nAutoclave the surgical tools and sanitize the surgery table and equipment using 70% ethanol. Wear a surgical mask and sterile gloves. Use a dry bead sterilizer to resterilize the surgical tools if multiple mouse surgeries will be conducted in one experiment.\nAnesthetize an 8- to 12-week-old mouse (mass: 25–30 g) by using 0.8% chloral hydrate, via an intraperitoneal injection. Make sure the anesthetized mouse does not have a pedal reflex (as tested using a firm toe pinch) after the anesthetization.\nUse vet ointment to prevent eye dryness for the mouse while it is under anesthesia.\nUse a noninvasive blood pressure system to monitor the mouse’s blood pressure.\nUse a physiological monitoring system to monitor its rectal temperature and arterial blood gases. Maintain the body temperature at 36.5 ± 0.5 °C.\nSubcutaneously inject the mouse with a prophylactic antibiotic (25 mg/kg cefazolin)8.\nPlace the mouse in the supine position on the heating pad.\nUse electric clippers to expose the skin by shaving the mouse’s fur on the ventral neck region, as well as in the region between the right eye and right ear.\nUse epilating cream to clear the fur from the mouse’s body and disinfect the surgical site alternating scrbus with povidione-iodine and  70% ethanol.\nUse iris scissors to cut a 1 cm-long midline incision at the neck.\nUse iris forceps to carefully dissect the CCA free from the vagus nerves without causing physical injury.\nUse 5-0 silk sutures to isolate the CCA.\nMake a 0.3 cm incision in the scalp at the midpoint between the right eye and right ear.",
    "Use microscissors to cut the temporalis muscle to expose the zygomatic and squamosal bone.\nUnder a stereo dissecting microscope, use a microdrill to create a 2 mm-diameter hole directly over the right-side distal MCA.\nLigate the trunk of the right-side distal MCA using a 10-0 suture.\nOcclude the right-side CCA using a nontraumatic aneurysm clip.\nAfter either 10 or 40 min of ischemia, remove the aneurysm clips and suture to restore blood flow to the MCA and CCA.\nUse a suture clip to seal the skin incision on the head.\nSeal the cervical skin incisions using a single suture followed by closing neck skin with suture or staple9. \nSubcutaneously inject buprenorphine (0.1 mg/kg) for pain relief9.\nMaintain the mouse’s body temperature at 36.5 ± 0.5 °C on the heating pad until it has fully recovered from the anesthesia. Do not return the animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until it has fully recovered. Do not leave the animal unattended until it regains sufficient consciousness.\nPlace the mouse into the autoclaved cage so that it can freely access water and chow after it has fully recovered.\n2. Staining with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride\nAnesthetize the mouse with 0.8% chloral hydrate via an intraperitoneal injection.\nUse operating scissors to decapitate the animal.\nExpose the skull by using iris scissors to make an incision in the skin of the head.\nUse operating scissors to cut the anterior of the frontal bone.\nUse iris scissors to cut the skull along the sagittal suture.\nUse a bone rongeur to push aside the frontal and parietal bone and expose the brain.\nUse iris forceps to dissect the brain.\nUse a mouse brain matrix and razor blades to obtain 2 mm coronal slices.",
    "Stain the brain slices for 10 min at 37 °C with 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) in 1x phosphate-buffered saline.\nRinse the brain 2x with 10% formalin.\nFix the brain in 10% formalin at room temperature for 24 h. \n3. Measurement of infarct size\nArrange the sections on a clean plastic slide and orient the sections from rostral to caudal.\nScan the slide using a scanner. Place a metric ruler and make sure it is visible in the scanned image. Flip the slide over and scan the reverse side.\nCalculate the infarction area of each section using ImageJ software.\n\t\nOpen the image file and set up the scale for the image.\nUse freehand selection to select the infarct area.\nUse the regions of interest (ROI) manager to measure the area of interest.\nSum the infarction areas for each section and multiply the result by the section thickness to estimate the total infarction volume.\n4. Statistical analysis\nUse GraphPad Prism 6 to determine the statistical significance with Student’s t-test.\n\tNOTE: The error bars on the bar graphs represent standard errors of the mean (SEMs).\nUse G*Power 3.1 to calculate the appropriate sample size and perform a power analysis10.\nSubscription Required.
