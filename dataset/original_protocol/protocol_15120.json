    "1. Preparation of C12FDG, Bafilomycin A1, and Cell Culture\nDissolve the C12FDG powder in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a final concentration of 20 mM. Aliquot and store at -20 °C. DMSO should be used with appropriate safety conditions.\nDissolve the bafilomycin A1 powder in DMSO to a final concentration of 0.1 mM. Aliquot and store at - 20 °C. Bafilomycin should be used with appropriate safety conditions.\nCultivate RPMI 8226 cell line, or other cell lines adherent or not, in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotics, at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Estimate the number of cells needed for the experiment. In order to record a sufficient number of events during the flow cytometry analysis, 5 x 105 cells are required. To determine the percentage of senescent cells, three cell samples are required: unlabeled sample, untreated cells stained with C12FDG, treated cells stained with C12FDG.\nSeed the cells 24 hr prior performing the experiment so that cells are in the log-phase of the cellular proliferation curve.\n2. Induction of Senescence\nInduce senescence of cancer cells by adding a chemotherapeutical drug. Drug concentration and duration of the treatment should be adapted to the cell type tested. Start with a 48 hr treatment at the final concentration of 50 nM doxorubicin for a concentration of cells at about 106 cells/ml. Do not forget to include untreated sample (negative control).\n3. Bafilomycin A1 Treatment",
    "Check cell viability by mixing cells with trypan blue (v/v), as the chemotherapeutical drug used in the previous step might lead to cell apoptosis. Fill into a Malassez chamber and count the number of blue cells (dead cells) and of white cells (living cells). If the percentage of viability is less than 70%, dead cells might be removed using an appropriate kit to ensure that dead cells will not bias the subsequent analysis.\nRemove the culture media and replace by prewarmed fresh culture media. Treat the cells with a final concentration of 100 nM of bafilomycin A1. Bafilomycin A1 is used to neutralize the acidic pH of lysosomes. Incubate 1 hr at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\n4. C12FDG Staining\nDissolve C12FDG in prewarmed fresh culture media to a final concentration of 2 mM.\nAdd the compound to cells at a final concentration of 33 μM and incubate 2 hr at 37 °C, 5% CO2. If using non-adherent cells, centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C (the speed might have to be adjusted to the cell type used), wash 2x with PBS. Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 μl of cold PBS. If using adherent cells, remove the media and wash 2x with PBS. Harvest the adherent cells using a trypsin solution and centrifuge cells at 300 x g for 5 min at 4 °C (the speed might have to be adjusted to the cell type used). Resuspend the cell pellet in 500 μl of cold PBS. In both cases, the cell concentration should be about 106 cells/ml.\nPerform a co-immunolabeling to further characterize the population of senescent cells.\n5. Flow Cytometry Analysis",
    "Calibrate the flow cytometer using the control beads recommended by the manufacturer of the flow cytometer. For all steps, at least 104 events have to be recorded.\nRun the first sample containing unlabeled cells. Prepare a two-parameter graphic displaying Forward Scatter Channel (FSC) versus Side Scatter Channel (SSC). Set the PhotoMultiplier Tubes (PMTs) and define a region of interest excluding dead cells and cellular debris that might have appeared during the sample preparation. Gate this region of interest in a one-parameter histogram displaying FL1 on the log scale of the x-axis and the number of events in the y-axis. The total number of events represents the number of cells analyzed. Set the PMT so that unlabeled cells appear in the first decade on the log scale of the x-axis. Determine the autofluorescence of the cells if necessary.\nRun the second sample containing untreated cells. On the one-parameter histogram displaying FL1 (fluorescence of C12FDG), place the cursor after the dimly labeled population. This threshold will allow the discrimination between non-senescent cells (dimly labeled cells) and senescent cells (brightly labeled cells).\nRun the third sample containing treated cells. Brightly labeled cells, i.e. senescent cells appear above the threshold determined in the previous step. Evaluate the percentage of senescent cells by dividing the number of bright events per the total number of events. If needed, the activity of the β-galactosidase can also be estimated using the mean fluorescence intensity.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
