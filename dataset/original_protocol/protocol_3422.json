In order to generate MADMTG/TG,gene-X animals and MADMGT/GT;Nestin-Cre animals please refer to the step-by-step protocol provided by our group12[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12] (see Troubleshooting Problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.1]).\nCheck for vaginal plug to monitor successful mating and to facilitate the experimental planning (see Troubleshooting Problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.3]).\nMales and females of the F1 generation can be used as experimental animals (genotype is either control [MADMGT/TG;Nestin-Cre] or genetic mosaic [MADMGT/TG,gene-X;Nestin-Cre]).\nPerform experiment at developmental stage(s) of choice.\nNote: Experimental animals can be used at embryonic stages, P0, early postnatal stages and up to adulthood (>P21). Here we made use of Nestin-Cre that is expressed in neural stem cells in both the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system.13[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13] Based on our experience, the protocol will most efficiently work with embryonic up to P0 brains, which show a low percentage of debris and exhibit high cell survival rate. In general, the time required for sorting increased with the age of the experimental animal due to an increase of myelin-containing debris in the single-cell suspension.\nNote: Here we describe the usage of Nestin-Cre. Besides Nestin-Cre, any other Cre-driver can be used, provided Cre is expressed in dividing stem and progenitor cells, to target cell types and lineages of interest. Depending on the use of specific chromosome with targeted MADM cassettes and the particular Cre driver, interchromosomal recombination and MADM-labeling efficiencies in experimental animals might vary1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] (see Troubleshooting Problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.5]).",
    "Note: If your experimental needs require sample pooling, perform genotyping with your standard genotyping protocol for your experimental mice to make sure your sample pool consists of the correct genotypes before you proceed with the protocol.\nPreparation of single-cell suspension from MADM-labeled mouse brains\nTiming: 1.5–3 h\nThis section of the protocol documents the dissection and preparation of single-cell suspension from MADM-labeled mouse brains for sorting of fluorescent cells.\nPrepare equipment (on the day of experiment) and required solutions:\nTiming: 30 min\nClean all dissection tools (2 curved forceps and scissors) with 70% ethanol and RNase Away, a decontamination reagent that removes RNase from equipment and surfaces.\nPre-warm shaking water bath (37°C) for single-cell suspension of desired tissue.\nPrepare collection tubes and respective buffer to sort your cells in.\nNote: The type of tube depends on your downstream analysis: use 1.5 mL microfuge tubes for 10× genomics single-cell RNA-seq experiments, 1.5 mL microfuge tubes for proteomics, or 0.2 mL PCR tubes for bulk RNA-seq with SMART-seq technology.\nNote: Since neither sorting device can hold 0.2 mL PCR tubes in its collection tube holders, prepare custom-made PCR tube holders for sorting:\nTake 1.5 mL microfuge tubes and cut off the lid.\nFill the 1.5 mL tubes with paper tissue or Parafilm (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nInsert a PCR tube in the middle of the stuffed 1.5 mL tube.\nAfter sorting, PCR tubes can be taken out of the 1.5 mL tubes with forceps and PCR tube holders can be reused by inserting a new PCR tube.\nNote: Here, we describe dissociation of the mouse cortex and midbrain as two examples of gray and white matter-rich tissues, respectively. However, this protocol can be used for all regions of the brain with suitable adaptations.",
    "Note: For more efficient dissociation and yield, mice P7 or older should first be perfused transcardially with cold HBSS before tissue isolation to remove blood from the brain. Additional debris removal steps (steps 30–38) based on a density-gradient are recommended when isolating white matter-rich regions like the cortex from mice ≥ P7, or the midbrain from mice ≥ P0 (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Debris not only includes dead cells, but also myelin fragments. With increasing levels of myelination in distinct brain regions, the amount of debris in your single-cell suspension increases. Thus, debris removal will help to increase the yield of your viable cell population for your FACS experiment.\nCritical: For brains requiring perfusion, supplement EBSS and DMEM/F12 with cell survival supplements in subsequent dissociation steps.\nCritical: There is no stopping point in the protocol after starting with dissection of the experimental animal until the end of sorting.\nPrepare all solutions listed below required for tissue dissociation:\nCold HBSS (for dissection of embryonic brains and perfusion of postnatal brains only).\nEBSS or EBSS with cell survival supplements.\nPapain-DNase solution.\nSolution 2.\nDMEM/F12 or DMEM/F12 with cell survival supplements.\nMedia.\nCold PBS (for debris removal steps only).\nDebris removal solution (for debris removal steps only).\nCritical: Adjust volume of Papain-DNase solution and Solution 2 according to amount of tissue per enzymatic digestion reaction.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_3187_13.csv\nDissect brains\nTiming: 10–30 min\nFor embryos and up to P7 postnatal mice, sacrifice mice by decapitation.\nExtract brain and dissect brain region of interest of embryos up to E16 in cold HBSS solution in a Petri-dish under a dissection microscope. Between E16 and P7, extract the brains as follows (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2H) and then skip to step 21:\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3187-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

This can be done by observing a complete lack of response after pinching their paws with forceps. If mice are still responsive after 5 min of administering anesthesia, more anesthesia working solution can be added in small amounts.\nPlace the anesthetized mouse in supine position on a perfusion tray and secure each foot with a separate needle.\nFill a 20 mL syringe with 20 mL of cold HBSS solution and attach a needle. Remove air bubbles and keep on ice until perfusion.\nDisinfect fur with 70% ethanol.",
    "Make a medial incision below the rib cage with scissors and surgical forceps through the skin and the underlying muscle layer. Continue to cut laterally until rib cage is exposed (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nLift the tip of the sternum with forceps and cut along the base of the diaphragm. Cut each sides of the rib cage to expose the heart (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J).\nMake an incision to the posterior end of the right atrium using small iris scissors to allow blood to drain during the perfusion (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K).\nInsert the needle attached to the 20 mL syringe needle containing cold HBSS into the lower left ventricle of the exposed heart.\nCritical: Be careful to not puncture the wall into the left atrium (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K).\nPress the syringe plunger at a steady pace (up to 20 mL/min depending on the age of the mouse) and perfuse with HBSS until the liver turns pale (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]L).\nWhen perfusion is complete, withdraw needle and decapitate mouse.\nExtract the brains as follows (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]M and 2N):\nRemove the skin and skull over the brain.\nMake a long cut on the top of the skull along the midline.\nFlip the cut skull to the side to have access to the brain.\nPlace curved forceps underneath the brain and remove it from the skull.\nAllow perfused brains to rest for 2 min in a beaker containing cold HBSS solution on ice before proceeding (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]O).\nCritical: A pale color of the brain is an indication of a successful perfusion (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]P).\nPrepare single-cell suspension\nTiming: 45 min to 2 h 15 min\nDissect region of interest (e.g., hippocampus, cortex or midbrain) from isolated brains by placing the brains in a petri dish and using forceps (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3187-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Dashed lines indicate hippocampus, cortex and midbrain, respectively. Abbreviations: Hi – hippocampus; Cx – neocortex; Mb – midbrain.\nNote: For perfused brains, perform dissection on ice cold surface.\nNote: For more efficient enzymatic dissociation, cut large pieces of tissue in smaller pieces using a sharp razor.\nCritical: In our experience, careful and precise dissection is most efficient to avoid contamination from cell types originating from other brain areas. The stepwise isolation of cortices, hippocampi and midbrain is illustrated (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A‒3F for perinatal brain; Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]G‒3N for adult brain).\nTransfer isolated tissue to prepared Papain-DNase solution in a 50 mL bioreactor tube (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A–4E).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3187-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

    "Critical: Avoid creating air bubbles (Figures 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]F and 4G). We prefer mechanical dissociation with a pipette over using a scalpel to keep the number of ruptured cells as small as possible.\nIncubate tissue in Papain-DNase solution at 37°C for 30 min covered from light in a shaking water bath set to 150 rpm.\nFor brains ≥ P7, briefly interrupt incubation after the first 15 min with manual dissociation described in step 23 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]H).\nDuring the incubation time, prepare the respective buffer or media for sorting and the appropriate collection tubes (0.2 mL PCR tubes) or 1.5 mL microfuge tubes.\nAfter 30 min, remove the bioreactor tube containing the dissociated tissue from the water bath and add Solution 2.\nMix thoroughly by pipetting up and down to dissolve remaining tissue parts (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]I) (see Troubleshooting Problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.9]).\nCentrifuge at 200 × g for 10 min at 20°C–22°C. A cell pellet should be visible (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]J).\nRemove supernatant and resuspend the pellet in Solution 2.\nAdd 4 mL DMEM/F12 as a wash buffer and mix well.\nCentrifuge at 350 × g for 10 min at 20°C–22°C. A washed cell pellet (smaller than the previous one) should be visible (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]K).\nFor cortices ≥ P7 or midbrain ≥ P0, perform debris removal steps starting from step 34. For younger brains, skip to step 42 (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]L) (see Troubleshooting Problem 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.11]).\nRemove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 1.5 mL cold PBS per pellet and transfer to individual 15 mL falcon tube per reaction. Perform the rest of debris removal steps on ice.\nAdd 1 mL cold Debris Removal Solution per tube and mix well.\nCarefully overlay 2 × 1 mL cold PBS per tube using a P1000 pipette with filtered pipette tips.",
    "Note: Prevent mixing by tilting the falcon tubes at a 45° angle while adding PBS. A clear PBS upper layer should be visible over a cloudy cell suspension bottom layer (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]M).\nCentrifuge at 3,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C (with maximum acceleration and brake speed).\nAfter centrifugation, an interface containing debris will be visible between layers 1 and 2.\nCarefully aspirate the top layer and then the debris interface with a P1000 pipette and discard, leaving most of the bottom layer containing the cell pellet undisturbed (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]N).\nFill each tube up to 5 mL with cold PBS and gently invert flacon tubes 3 times.\nCritical: Do not vortex.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C (with maximum acceleration and brake speed). A final pellet will be visible (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]O).\nRemove supernatant and resuspend pellet in 100–300 μL media depending on the size of the final cell pellet.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3187-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5.

    "(D) Dot plots showing the gating concept for MADM-labeled cells from P0 MADM-19 GT/TG;Nestin-Cre cortex. Use this strategy as a template for your experiment: first set a gate on live cells (gate P1) and then use area (A) and width (W) measurements of forward scatter (gate P2) and side scatter (gate P3) to gate on true singlets. For the final gating step, display fluorescence intensities for GFP and tdT/mCherry from live singlets and place gates on GFP+, tdT+, and GFP+ tdT+ cell populations. Abbreviations: FSC-A – forward scatter area; SSC-A – side scatter area; FSC-W – forward scatter width; SSC-W – side scatter width.\nNote: Cell-suspension should be milky without visible pieces of tissue.\nCritical: Cell suspension that is too dilute results in unnecessary extra time during FACS which, depending on the sorting buffer, might lead to low survival rate of cells. Cell suspension that is too concentrated can be further diluted using media at a later stage.\nKeep single-cell suspension on ice until sorting.\nSorting MADM-labeled cells for downstream molecular analysis (collection of low cell numbers)\nTiming: 45 min to 3 h\nIn this section of the protocol we describe how MADM+ cells can be sorted according to their fluorescent colors and collected for downstream molecular analyses such as RNA-sequencing on two different sorting devices: BD Aria III and SONY SH800. We will describe the general protocol for sorting and highlight SONY- or Aria-specific steps.\nNote: Successful sorting requires recording of various parameters at the flow cytometer that a) ensure visualization of size and cellular granularity to perform size exclusion (Figures 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A and 5B): FSC (forward scatter), SSC (side scatter) or BSC (back scatter), and b) allow visualization of fluorescence intensity of the MADM labeling in order to properly gate on MADM-labeled cell populations (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C): GFP and tdT.",
    "Note: Be aware that you need to define the negative and positive signal of your selected fluorophores individually. This is done best by using a histogram to visualize fluorescence intensity. We usually define negative populations by adjusting the voltage of the respective fluorophore to a value that places the maximum of the negative population peak at 102 (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]C). For this purpose, negative populations are cells without MADM-labeling which should be the majority and result in a large peak. The MADM-labeled positive populations will make up a distinct and much smaller peak.\nNote: A summary of the complete gating concept for MADM-labeled cells is provided in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D. First set a gate to discriminate between debris and live cells and thus to select the live cell population. Next, remove doublets by use FSC-A and FSC-W. Then, use SSC-H and SSC-W at Aria or BSC-A and BSC-W at SONY to perform a second round of doublet exclusion. Finally, display GFP and tdT to set your gates for sorting MADM+ cells (GFP+, tdT+ and optionally GFP+ TdT+ double positive) cells (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]D).\nEnsure that the cytometer is correctly set up for your sorting experiment.\nUse the 100 μm nozzle.\nSelect/turn on the 488 nm and 561 nm lasers.\nSet the temperature for sample and collection tubes to 4°C.\nPrepare one FACS tube with RNase Away and one FACS tube with RNase-free water (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3187-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "(D) Collection tube inserted in 2 way tube holder at SONY SH800.\n(E and F) Collection tube inserted in 4-way 1.5 mL tube holder at BD Aria.\nFlush the system with each solution for approximately 1 min. First use RNase Away, then RNase-free water.\nFilter your entire sample through a 40 μm cell strainer using a P1000 with filter tips (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nDilute your sample with 200–300 μL media, which is additionally pipetted through the cell strainer.\nInsert test sort collection tubes (empty 1.5 mL microfuge tubes or empty 0.2 mL PCR tubes, depending on your downstream application).\nNote: We have chosen to depict the tube holder for 0.2 mL PCR tubes in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C) into the collection tube holder at SONY (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]D) or BD Aria (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]E and 6F).\nNote: Only at BD Aria: Use “test sort” to adjust the side streams in order to allow the side streams to hit the middle of the collection tubes. Afterwards, discard the test sort collection tubes. At SONY, side streams cannot be adjusted by the operator.\nIn the parameters window, select FSC-A, FSC-H, FSC-W, BSC-A, BSC-H, BSC-W, GFP, and tdT when operating the SONY SH800 (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A, left).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3187-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7.

Note that settings for sorting are instantly visible at the bottom of SONY sorting software.",
    "(D) Selection of basic settings (selecting parameters as well as setting voltages, left), adjustment of axis display for dot plots by selecting biexponential display (middle) and setup of sort layout (right) at BD Aria. Note that the sort layout window needs to be attentively opened by clicking on the tab “Sort” and selecting “Sort layout” in BD DIVA software.\nSelect FSC-A, FSC-H, FSC-W, SSC-A, SSC-H, SSC-W, FITC, and mCherry when operating the BD Aria (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D, left).\nSensor gain should be optimized according to signal strength (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A, middle). For detailed video guide, see Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1].\nLoad your sample and record 30,000–50,000 events in order to set up the gating parameters with the recorded cells.\nNote: The baseline settings at SONY might not show all FSC and BSC events within the range of the axes. You can manually adjust the axes ranges by right-clicking on the respective axis, selecting “properties” and then entering a different minimum or maximum value for the axis scale (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]A, right).\nNote: At BD Aria, detectors for FITC and mCherry will not show a spill-over of one fluorophore to the other, therefore no compensation is needed. However, the detector configuration of SONY requires compensation. With MADM, we recommend to perform manual compensation at SONY by dragging the respective cell populations with the cursor in the correct direction (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]B).\nNote: Dot plots showing fluorescence intensities usually display logarithmic scales by default. We recommend to switch to biexponential display for an inclusive visualization of all acquired cells and thus a better discrimination of negative and positive populations (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C for SONY; Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D, middle, for BD Aria).\nPrepare the collection tubes for your sorted cells.\nNote: The type of tube depends on your downstream analysis:",
    "For low input bulk RNA-seq, prepare 0.2 mL PCR tubes containing 4 μL Lysis buffer as collection tubes for your sorted cells. Since neither sorting device can hold 0.2 mL PCR tubes in its collection tube holders, prepare custom-made PCR tube holders for sorting. We show this type of collection tubes as examples in the figures of our protocol (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C–6F):\nTake 1.5 mL microfuge tubes and cut off the lid.\nFill the 1.5 mL tubes with paper tissue or Parafilm (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nInsert a PCR tube in the middle of the stuffed 1.5 mL tube.\nAfter sorting, PCR tubes can be taken out of the 1.5 mL tubes using forceps and PCR tube holders can be reused by inserting a new PCR tube.\nFor 10X Genomics scRNA-seq, prepare 1.5 mL microfuge tubes containing 100 μL media.\nFor proteomics, prepare 1.5 mL microfuge tubes containing 50 μL lysis buffer (LYSE-NHS from PreOmics iST-NHS kit).\nFor sorting at SONY: the sorting options are already visible at the bottom of the software wizard (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]C, bottom), thus you can instantly select the correct tube holder (in our case: 2 way tubes).\nFor sorting at Aria: open the “sort layout” in BD DIVA software, choose 4 tube collection device and select 4-way purity as the sorting mode to sort your sample (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]D, right).\nAssign the sorting gates to the collection tubes.\nStart sorting.\nNote: Depending on your experimental needs and the MADM lines used, either set a maximum number of labeled cells that shall be collected or collect an indefinite number of cells to obtain as many cells as possible.\nNote down the number of sorted cells from each selected cell population when sorting at BD Aria.",
    "Note: As opposed to SONY sorting software, BD DIVA software does not save the number of sorted cells from each sample.\nNote: For bulk RNA-seq: The RNA Lysis buffer described in this protocol was used and optimized for single cells and low amounts of cells (max. 400 cells). If a greater number of cells will be collected with FACS, a different lysis buffer needs to be used. For details, please see.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]\nNote: For bulk RNA-seq: Design a layout for collecting your samples. Keep in mind that you may want to sort a higher number of cells (up to 400 cells) as a positive control for your sequencing experiment in one of the wells. For this purpose, you can make use of the MADM-unlabeled cells as they are not limited in cell number.\nCritical: Prior to sorting, consult with your sequencing facility regarding the plate layout since empty wells and a positive control might be needed at specific positions.\nOnce sorting is completed, proceed with your collection tubes to the next steps depending on the further downstream application (see Troubleshooting Problem 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec7.13]).\nNote: For bulk RNA-seq: transfer the entire volume of the collected sample into an empty well in a 96-well plate, which should remain on dry ice throughout the procedure. Be fast with pipetting since samples freeze in the pipette tip if this step is executed too slowly.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1. Video guide to software settings at SONY and BD Aria flow cytometers, related to step 52",
    "Collect all replicates for your RNA-sequencing experiment in the same 96-well plate. Either fill the entire plate on a single day, or add individual samples on a day-to-day basis. When adding few samples over a time course of several days or weeks, store the plate at ‒80°C until further processing or additional samples can be added.\nNote: The described setup with collecting samples on a 96-well plate allows sample collection for RNA-sequencing on consecutive days. However, sample collection and handling may need to be adapted to individual use and respective purposes.\nAfter sorting of all required samples is completed, seal the plate with AluminaSeal, freeze immediately on dry ice and store at ‒80°C until further processing. In order to ensure maximum sequencing efficiency plates should be processed within three months after collection.\nNote: For 10X genomics scRNA-seq: spin down the tubes with your sorted cells, remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in Chromium Next GEM Master Mix. Proceed with sample preparation according to the 10X genomics protocol used by your sequencing facility.\nNote: For proteomics: Immediately after sorting, boil your samples for 10 min and then continue with the protocol of the iST-NHS kit (PreOmics).7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nCritical: Since only one sample can be sorted at any time, it is important to determine the required number of cells for your sequencing experiment beforehand. The longer a sample is kept on ice before it is processed by FACS, the higher the amount of dead cells. Instead of preparing single-cell suspensions from multiple samples at the same time, consider to prepare single-cell suspensions in multiple batches to keep the waiting time of individual samples on ice short and thus increase the cell survival rate."
