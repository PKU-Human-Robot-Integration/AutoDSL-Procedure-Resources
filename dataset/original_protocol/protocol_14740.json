    "1. Isolation of EVs from a biofluid \nIsolate EVs by one of the established methods, such as the differential ultracentrifugation8, precipitation, or size-exclusion chromatography9.\nConfirm the presence of expected surface and luminal biomarkers and the absence of biomarkers indicating cross-contamination of the preparation. Confirm the lipid bilayer morphology of the isolated particles by electron microscopy.\n\tNOTE: When isolating the exosomes, the hydrodynamic size distribution measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) or dynamic light scattering should be in the expected range. The details of EV and exosome isolation are beyond the scope of this protocol. The selected method will depend on experimental questions and the goal of the study10. The following steps provide a concrete illustration of the procedure to enrich the exosomes by precipitation from the growth medium of MCF-7 breast cancer cells using a commercially available precipitation kit (Table of Materials).\nBefore cell culture expansion, store MCF-7 breast cancer cells in liquid nitrogen. Thaw cells to subculture.\nFollowing aseptic practices, perform cell plating on 150 mm plates. Use the growth medium composed of the Eagle’s minimum essential medium, 0.01 mg/mL human recombinant insulin, and 10% exosome-free fetal bovine serum.\nAerate the culture by 95% air and 5% CO2 and incubate at 37 °C.\nAfter the cells are settled (approximately 24 h after plating), change the media. Split the plate at 1:10 ratio and culture ten plates, each containing 20 mL of media.\nHarvest and pool media from 9 of these plates (180 mL) at ~70−80% confluence when cells are still in the growth phase.\nDivide the media into 60 mL and 120 mL, further split into 30 mL/tube, and centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 15 min.\nTransfer the supernatant from each tube to a new sterile 50 mL tube and perform the exosome isolation.",
    "Isolate exosomes by precipitation according to published protocols (see, for example, reference11) or follow the manufacturer’s instructions if a commercial isolation kit (Table of Materials) is used. As a first step in the latter case, centrifuge cell medium at 3,000 x g for 15 min. Withdraw supernatant and discard cells and cell debris.\nAdd the precipitation solution (1:5 volume ratio) to the supernatant, mix, and refrigerate overnight.\nCentrifuge at 1,500 x g for 30 min at room temperature. Discard the supernatant after centrifugation.\nSpin the remaining exosome pellet for another 5 min at 1,500 x g. Without disturbing the pellet, remove the remaining precipitation solution by aspiration.\nResuspend the pellet in 100−500 µL of 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer and divide into multiple aliquots as needed for the downstream analysis.\nImmediately proceed to the surface immobilization of the isolated exosomes for AFM imaging. If necessary, freeze the aliquots at -80 °C for later use while taking precautions to avoid damage to the sample during the freeze-thaw cycle.\n2. Surface fixation of extracellular vesicles\nUse strong double-sided tape, epoxy, or an alternative adhesive to firmly attach a mica disk to an AFM/scanning tunneling microscope (STM) magnetic stainless-steel specimen disk.\nCleave mica disc by using a sharp razor or utility knife, or by attaching an adhesive tape to the top surface and then pealing it off to remove a layer of material.\n\tNOTE: Either method should reveal a virgin surface by removing a thin layer of mica previously exposed to the environment. After the procedure, the attachment of mica to the AFM/STM metal specimen disk must remain firm.\nAt room temperature, treat the top surface of mica for 10 s with 100 µL of 10 mM NiCl2 solution, which modifies the surface charge from negative to positive.",
    "Blot NiCl2 solution with a lint-free wipe or blotting paper. Wash the mica surface 3x with deionized (DI) water and dry it with a stream of dry nitrogen.\n\tNOTE: It is a good practice to scan the modified surface with AFM to confirm it is free from contaminants.\nPlace the AFM specimen disk with the attached surface-modified mica in a petri dish.\nDilute the exosome sample from step 1.14 with 1x PBS to obtain a concentration between 4.0 x 109 and 4.0 x 1010 particles per mL of solution. Validate the diluted particle concentration using NTA.\nForm a sessile drop on the surface of mica by emptying 100 μL of the diluted exosome solution from a pipette.\nPlace lid on the petri dish and seal it with a paraffin film to reduce sample evaporation. Incubate the sample for 12−18 h at 4 °C.\n\tNOTE: The surface density of the immobilized exosomes will increase with the incubation time and the concentration of EVs in the liquid. Longer incubation time may be necessary if exosomes are present in the sample at lower concentrations.\nAfter incubation, aspirate 80−90% of the sample without disturbing the surface. At this point, the exosomes will be electrostatically immobilized on the mica substrate.\nBefore imaging hydrated EVs, rinse the surface with 1x PBS. Repeat 3x. Take care to keep the sample hydrated throughout the rinsing process.\nAfter washing the mica surface with 1x PBS, remove 80%−90% of liquid, and pipette ~40 μL of fresh 1x PBS to cover the sample.\nWhen imaging the desiccated EVs, rinse the substrate with DI water. Repeat 3x.\n\tNOTE: Rinsing with DI water will prevent the formation of salt crystals and the deposition of solutes on the surface as the substrate dries.",
    "Before imaging desiccated EVs, aspirate as much liquid as possible without touching the surface and dry the rest with a stream of dry nitrogen.\n3. AFM imaging \nTo image the desiccated EVs, select a cantilever designed for scanning in the air in tapping and non-contact imaging modes and mount it onto the probe holder.\n\tNOTE: The characteristics of an example cantilever listed in Table of Materials (123 μm length, 40 μm width, 7 nm tip radius, and 37 N/m spring constant) may be used as a guide when selecting a probe compatible with the available AFM instrumentation.\n\t\nPlace the preparation from step 2.13 on the AFM stage. The magnetic stainless-steel specimen disk will immobilize the sample on the stage. Allow time for the preparation and the stage to equilibrate thermally.\nUse the tapping mode to scan a sufficiently large area of the mica’s surface. For example, choose an area of 5 x 5 µm, rastered in 512 lines at a scan rate of ~1 Hz. Acquire both the height and phase images as they provide complementary information on the topography and the surface properties of the sample.\n\t\tNOTE: The scan time will increase with the imaged area and the number of lines selected to form the image but decrease with the scan rate defined as the number of lines scanned per second. Fast scan rates may impact the image quality. Therefore, the speed of rastering should judicially balance the tradeoff between the acquisition time and the image quality.\nTo image hydrated vesicles, select a cantilever appropriate for scanning soft, hydrated samples and mount the cantilever onto a probe holder designed for scanning in liquids.",
    "NOTE: When selecting a probe compatible with the available AFM instrumentation, the specifications of the probe listed in Table of Materials (triangular cantilever with 175 µm nominal length, 22 µm width, 20 nm tip radius, 0.07 N/m spring constant, and optimized for imaging with the drive frequency in the range between 4 to 8 kHz) may be used as a guide.\n\t\nWet the tip of the cantilever with 1x PBS to reduce the likelihood of introducing air bubbles into the liquid during scanning.\nPlace the preparation from step 2.11 on the AFM stage. The magnetic stainless-steel specimen disk will immobilize the attached mica containing immobilized EVs on its surface.\nAllow time for the preparation and the AFM stage to equilibrate thermally.\nImage the hydrated mica surface in the tapping mode. Acquire both the height and phase images.\n\t\tNOTE: The imaging quality is influenced by the instrumentation, selected probe, and scan parameters. When optimizing the scanning conditions, the following choices may be used as a starting point: 5 x 5 µm area scanned in 512 lines with ~0.8-1.0 Hz scan rate and drive frequency between 4 to 8 kHz.\n4. Image analysis\nNOTE: The following data processing and analysis steps are applied to the acquired height images. A similar procedure may be adapted to analyze the phase data. The description below is specific to Gwyddion12, a free and open source software available under GNU General Public License. Similar capabilities are available in alternative software tools.\nGo to Data Process, SPM modes, Tip and choose Model Tip (Figure 2). Select the geometry and the dimensions of the tip used to scan the sample and click OK.",
    "Correct the tip erosion artifacts by performing the surface reconstruction. Open the image. From the menu, select Data Process, SPM modes, Tip, then choose Surface Reconstruction and click OK (Figure 3).\nAlign the imaging plane to match the laboratory XY plane by removing the tilt in the substrate from the scan data. To accomplish this task, select Data Process, Level and choose Plane Level (Figure 4).\nAlign rows of the image by selecting Data Process, Correct Data and then choose Align Rows. Several alignment options are available (Figure 5). For example, Median is an algorithm that finds an average height of each scan line and subtracts it from the data.\nGo to Data Process, Correct Data and choose Remove Scars (Figure 6), which removes common scanning errors known as scars.\nAlign the mica surface at the zero height, Z = 0, by selecting Flatten Base in Level drop-down menu accessible from Data Process (Figure 7).\nIdentify EVs on the scanned surface by using Mark by Threshold in Grains drop-down menu (Figure 8A). This algorithm identifies surface-immobilized exosomes as particles protruding from the zero-surface substrate by the height above the user-selected threshold. Select a threshold in the range between 1 and 3 nm, which will eliminate most of the background interference. Smaller thresholds are used with cleaner background.\n\tNOTE: The threshold in Figure 8A is 1.767 nm. The outcome of the MCF-7 exosome identification with this thresholding is shown in Figure 8B. Gwyddion offers several alternatives to thresholding as the algorithm to automatically identify vesicles in the image, including automated thresholding (Otsu's method), edge detection, and the watershed algorithm.\n\tNOTE: Particle agglomerates, if present in the AFM image, may be masked and excluded from the analysis.",
    "Perform geometric and dimensional characterization of the identified EVs using the available Distributions algorithms accessible from Grains menu.\n\tNOTE: Gwyddion provides tools to assess the distribution of scalar-valued, areal, volumetric, and other properties of immobilized EVs in a hydrated or dessicated state. An example of a scalar-values property is shown in Figure 9, which gives the distribution of maximum heights within the footprint of each identified exosome.\nExport the AFM data from Gwyddion for specialized analysis by other computational tools and custom computer programs.\nSubscription Required.
