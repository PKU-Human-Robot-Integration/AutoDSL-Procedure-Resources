    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nInduction of Anesthesia\nTiming: 5 min\nThese steps ensure the transition from an awake animal to a state of controlled and stable anesthesia.\nWeigh mouse - This is important to calculate the proper amount of premedication and to follow recovery and weight gain post-surgery.\nPrepare premedication/analgesia: Buprenorphin (Buprenex®) diluted at 0.03 mg/mL – Final dose 0.1 mg/kg.\nNote: Analgesia protocols must be adapted to local guidelines and legislation concerning the use of opioid drugs. It is recommended to seek advice from local animal welfare and veterinary committees.\nNote: Keep records of anesthesia/surgery procedures for post-surgical care. See for example Supplementary document 1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/73-Mmc1.docx].\nAlternatives: NSAID are good alternatives to opioids. For example Carprofen (Rimadyl®) diluted at 0.5 mg/mL – Final dose 5 mg/kg.\nPlace pregnant dam in the induction chamber with air flow at 1 L/min and Isoflurane at 5% until the animal is sedated.\nNote: This step takes on average 60 to 90 sec depending on animal’s age, weight and body fat. Longer time may indicate a leakage in the circuit or Isoflurane exhaustion from the evaporator.\nCritical: This step must be monitored carefully to avoid a potentially lethal Isoflurane overdose.\nTake the mouse out of the induction chamber and place it face down (ventral decubitus) on the surgical drape.\nRapidly inject the premedication mix by subcutaneous injection in the interscapular area.\nTreat both eyes with moisturizer/corneal protection gel (Ocry-Gel®) immediately before placing the animal’s head into the mask.\nLay the animal face up (dorsal decubitus), head entirely in the mask, with air flow at 1 L/min and Isoflurane at 2%.\nCheck the absence of reflex (indicating a deep anesthetized state) by pinching the hind paw and the tip of the tail.",
    "Note: Steps 4-7 must be performed quickly (∼15 sec) to avoid the animal waking from anesthesia.\nCritical: From this point the whole procedure should be finished within 30 minutes to ensure pups viability. Longer surgeries negatively impact litter viability.\nLess experienced surgeons should chose to inject/electroporate fewer embryos in order to remain within the 30 minutes optimal timing. This is especially important when using strains with large litter size (such as Swiss mice)\nSurgical Preparation\nTiming: 5 min\nThese steps ensure the proper preparation of an aseptic surgical zone and surgeon. If instructions are followed properly, post-surgical antibiotic therapy is not necessary.\nSurgical hair clipping on a square zone of about 4x4cm centered around the umbilicus (navel). The region corresponds approximatively to the space comprised between the mammary glands 3 (thoracic) and 4 (abdominal) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/73-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Preparation of the Mouse for the Surgery\n(A) Clipping region on the abdomen of the mouse, centered around the umbilic. Anatomical marks are the 3rd and 4th mammary glands.\n(B) The region is prepared by alternative Alcohol-Iodine treatment. After the 3rd wash, Iodine solution is left over the skin for the surgery and not washed away.\nCritical: Stretching the skin of the abdomen avoids skin lesions/micro cuts when shearing. Skin irritation has a strong negative impact on post-surgical well-being and can lead to lack of care of newborn litter.\nSurgical zone preparation: using surgical gauze, alternate cleaning with 70% surgical ethanol and Povidone-iodine (Betadine®) Scrub 2 times, then one final time with Vetedine® solution (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nNote: Follow a circular pattern from umbilic to the outer part of the clipped region without returning to center.",
    "Remove the soiled surgical drape by gently lifting the mouse without touching the prepped zone. At this stage the mouse should be in dorsal decubitus, on a clean, sterile drape, above the heating pad.\nPrepare surgery tools: adjust the light above the surgical site. Open the surgical box and gently drop instruments on the sterile drape (without touching them). Open the electrodes box. Open one suture pack. Open one sterile 10mL syringe. Open the 50mL conical tube containing sterile heated PBS. Gently break the tip of the microcapillary and place it in a tube containing DNA plasmid (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/73-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Surgical Instruments Are Disposed on a Sterile Surgical Drape in a Convenient Way for the Surgeon to Avoid Cross-contamination by Touching Non Sterile Material\n(A–J) (A) 10mL syringe. (B) Gold paddles. (C) Resorbable suture. (D) Sterile gauze. (E) Surgical drape (to cover mouse during surgery). (F) Suture clips. (G) Michel clip forceps. (H) Iris forceps. (I) Halsey needle holder. (J) Iris scissors.\nCritical: Carefully check that everything ‘non sterile’ has been prepped for surgery as the next steps will be performed with sterile, surgical gloves.\nSurgical Procedure\nTiming: ∼20 min depending on the number of embryos. Should not be longer than 25 min for optimal viability.\nThis is the main step of the procedure consisting of a laparotomy to expose the embryos, plasmid micro-injection, electroporation, and suture.\nPut on surgical (sterile) gloves. You can now touch sterile instruments and drapes but should refrain from touching non sterile parts (animal, lamp…).\nNote: The surgical box contains two gauze pads that have been autoclaved with the instruments and can thus be used to touch non sterile parts during the surgery, such as the genepaddles and injector.",
    "Place a sterile surgical drape covering the whole mouse with 4x2cm aperture centered on the umbilic.\nOptional: You may use single use sterile plastic drapes. The aperture can be customized by cutting the fabric before placing the drape above the mouse.\nUse forceps on left hand to raise the skin above umbilic and with scissors on your right hand, gently perform a mid-sagittal (“vertical”) incision of about 2.5cm (1cm above umbilic and 1.5cm below). The incision should expose the umbilic scar and the white line joining the two abdominal muscles (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/73-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Skin Incision Is Performed by Gently Raising the Skin and Cutting with the Iris Scissors\nThe white line joining the two abdominal muscles (A) and the umbilical scar (B) are visible under the scissors tip. Subsequent incision of muscle along the white line prevents bleeding during surgery and strongly increases functional recovery and delivery.\nCritical: Use the needle holder to gently dilacerate adherences between skin and abdominal muscle. To do so, put the tip of the closed needle holder in the wound, in contact with the muscle. Gently open it so its jaws push skin tissue on the side. This step will facilitate embryo mobilization and future suture.\nUse forceps on left hand to raise the umbilic and with scissors on your right hand, very carefully make a small (1mm) incision. After pneumo-abdomen (entry of air into the abdomen) has been obtained, perform a 2cm incision along the white line (0.8cm above and 1.2cm below umbilicus).\nNote: The entry of air into the abdomen should release the abdominal organs from adhering to the abdominal wall and hence facilitate the incision of the muscular plane.",
    "Expose one uterine horn with forceps. Carefully pull out all the horn from one side up to the ovary and count embryos.\nNote: Assess embryo viability. Healthy embryos have a light pink coloration and clear amniotic liquid. Embryos that are all white, or presenting signs of hemorrhage, or cloudy amniotic liquid, should be skipped as they are unlikely to survive, and injection risks cross-contaminating healthy embryos.\nUse your left hand to stabilize one embryo between thumb and pointer fingers. Embryos are fairly mobile in the amniotic pouch and with care can be oriented to better suit the injection. It is important to take care not to damage either the placenta or the blood vessels while manipulating/injecting.\nCritical: Refrain to apply too much pressure on the amniotic bag, which could otherwise break as it is punctured by the capillary.\nPerform plasmid injection: with the microcapillary, gently poke into the lateral ventricle. You may often feel two steps of injection (two hit pass), corresponding to the capillary going through the uterus, and then through the skin and skull. Inject ∼0.2-0.3μL of plasmid DNA using the foot pedal from the microinjector (or mouth aspirator tube) (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) (Video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/73-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Plasmid Microinjection\nLeft hand is used to stabilize the embryo.\n                Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n            \nVideo S2. Approach to microinjection of plasmid DNA into the lateral ventricle (related to Surgical procedure - Step 19)",
    "Left hand is used to stabilize the head of the embryo while with the other end the tip of the capillary is pushed through the uterus and the skull, into the lateral ventricle. Note the penetration of the tip of the glass capillary into the skull of the embryo. Once inside the ventricle, plasmid solution in injected until the ventricle is filled with the light-blue solution. The capillary is then removed and the surgeon can proceed to the next step (electroporation).\nNote: The length of the tip inserted in the skull is usually a fairly short length, for the ventricle is not located very deep in the brain. One good estimation would be about 4mm total, 2mm through the uterus and 2mm into the skull (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nCritical: Injection can be visualized by filling of the ventricle with the blue dye, giving a crescent shape. If ventricle filling is not observed, the injection is most likely unsuccessful owing to a wrong injection angle or depth (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]). It is not advised to give more than two attempts on a single embryo.\nNote: The interval between injection depends on the experience of the surgeon and is approximatively 0.5 min for a trained surgeon.\nNote: To save time, experienced surgeons may perform sequentially all injections, then all electroporations. This significantly cuts the procedure time by limiting handling and alternating between injection and electroporation. However sequential injections increase the risk of plasmid diffusion and dilution which would affect the electroporated zone. For these reasons less experienced surgeons should refrain from performing sequential injections.",
    "Perform electroporation: place the anode (positively charged electrode) on the side of DNA injection and the cathode on the other side of the embryos head and press foot pedal. Wait until the electroporation has been delivered in full (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]) (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). It is normal to witness slight contractile movements of the embryo during electroporation.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/73-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Position of the GenePad Electrodes during the Electroporation Procedure\nUse the flat side of the negatively charged electrode to stabilize the embryo. Make contact of the edge of the positively charged electrode close to the injected region (“blue crescent”).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_73_1.csv\nNote: Keep the uterus hydrated at all time during the procedure by dripping warm sterile PBS over the uterus (using the 10mL syringe). This is especially critical to ensure a good electroporation rate. Be careful not to overload with PBS to prevent soaking the anesthetized mouse, since a wet animal is more prone to potentially fatal hypothermia.\nWhen all embryos on one side have been electroporated, carefully put back the uterine horn in the abdomen, starting by the extremity attached to the ovary. Pull out the other horn and perform steps 18-20 over again.\nCritical: Longer procedure (>30 minutes from induction of anesthesia to arrest of isoflurane) strongly impacts viability of the whole litter. We recommend less experienced surgeons, who are slower at injecting and electroporating, to refrain from injecting and electroporating all the embryos.\nNote: Although this is not described in this protocol, it is possible to perform multiple injections in the same embryo. Time between the two injections and electroporations is required for plasmid wash out of the ventricle. See for example (Zhou et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib22]).",
    "Stitching: using the forceps and needle holder, perform sutures using resorbable string. Spacing between two passes of the string should be about the size of forceps tip (closed).\nMuscle stitching: running suture, lock with a knot every 3 passes.\nSet the isoflurane on 1% to lighten anesthesia and speed recovery.\nSkin stitching: running suture, lock with a knot every 3 passes.\nTurn off isoflurane. Before the mouse wakes from anesthesia (1 minute), you may place surgical clips (x4) above knots to prevent the mouse removing skin stitches.\nNote: Typically the suture size should be 6 passes (with one intermediary knot) for muscle stitching and 9 passes (with two intermediary knots) for skin suture.\nNote: Tension on the knot should be limited. Tight knots tend to be less tolerated by the animal and are more likely to be removed by the animal out of irritation/pain.\nPost-surgical Care\nTiming: 15 min (immediate care) and 2 days (follow-up care)\nPost-surgical care includes the immediate aftermath of the surgical procedure (i.e. getting the mouse to awaken completely and be back in the cage), and the follow-up care in the days following surgery.\nImmediately after isoflurane has been turned off and/or clips have been placed (step 22), remove the mouse’s head from the surgical mask. The mouse should gradually wake up, starting from 30-60 seconds, and be fully awake within 2 to 5 minutes.\nHeating: place the mouse back in the home cage. A heated block placed under the cage should provide a warm environment. It is important that the heated block does not cover all the surface of the cage so the mouse can move to a part of the cage without heating if it feels more comfortable.",
    "Alternatives: The cage can be placed instead under a heating lamp. Although this solution offers faster body temperature recovery, it requires extra care since a lamp too close can cause burning and dehydration.\nWithin 5 minutes the mouse should be on its 4 feet and moving upon stimulation. Leave the mouse in shelter and observe regularly for the next 10 minutes. Within 15 minutes following surgery the mouse should be moving spontaneously in the cage and start cleaning.\nOptional: At this stage a pain assessment scoring can be performed. This scoring will serve as a baseline for subsequent recovery and pain evaluation.\nNote: Occasionally vaginal discharge can be observed following surgery, often resulting from breakage of the amniotic bag during surgery. Although this situation should be avoided, this discharge is not systematically predictive of abortion (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nFollow-up care\nInspect the mouse twice a day for 48 hours following surgery. Perform a pain assessment scoring and decide accordingly regarding the use of analgesic medicine (Supplementary document 1[href=https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/73-Mmc1.docx]). Standardized mouse grimace scales are a good resource to evaluate post-surgical pain (Langford et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nOn the day following surgery, inspect the wound and be especially attentive to removed stitches. The loss of skin stitches happens rarely (less than 5% of cases) when stitches are performed properly. In most of the cases this problem is detected in the thoracic region when stitches are too tight and is typically well supported by the mouse (Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nCritical: Excessive stress to the mother leads to birthing complications, litter rejection or cannibalism. Stress can disrupt nest building and future care for newborn pups. It is critical to limit mouse handling as much as possible in the few days following surgery and around birth. Mouse cage must be placed in a calm room with little traffic."
