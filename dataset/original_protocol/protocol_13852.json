    "The protocol follows the operating room guidelines of the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute, University of Miami and is applicable to infants, young children, and uncooperative adults. Patients who cannot have general anesthesia due to safety issues should not have the procedure.\n1. Operating room selection and modification\nSelect an operating room with low 60 Hz background electric current noise and proper electrical grounding, to avoid ERG recording interference. Use a room with an isolated electrical circuit without connection to or is near heavy appliances (e.g., refrigerator).\n\t\nPerform trial ERG recordings in the operating room at the location where the ERG recording will take place. Check the ERG recording baseline as well as the trial recording waveforms to determine the absence of 60 Hz background electric noise.\nInspect the operating room for light leaks from ceiling, door, and window openings. Perform human observation after full dark adaptation (30 to 45 minutes) given that the normal human eye can detect light as dim as approximately 4 photons, which is better than any man-made light meter except liquid nitrogen-cooled detectors for astronomy.\nInstall opaque non-reflective black curtains on tracks to cover the operating room door and window openings fully without light leakage (Figure 1). Select curtain material that is washable and resistant to staining and bacterial growth. Follow local operating room regulations and procedures for proper interval cleaning. Block light leaks from the ceiling if present.\n2. Foldable portable darkroom selection and modification",
    "Select a portable darkroom that is easy to install and store and large enough to enclose the patient’s head, the ERG examiner, and the ffERG stimulus. Use folding portable darkrooms designed for an optic physicist (e.g., www.scientex.co.jp/pdf/pdf-b-lp-eng.pdf, 48”x 48”x81” cross type) which are available commercially and optimizes the maintenance of retinal dark adaptation of the patient during scotopic ffERG recordings (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: The fabric of the portable darkroom mentioned was tested by the eye institute’s microbiology department for ease of disinfection and the optical transmission was tested by the eye institute’s biomedical department before purchase. This is recommended if a different portable darkroom is used.\nAdd a small opening with double flaps at the rear of the portable darkroom to allow routing connections and cables (Figure 3).\n\tNOTE: During scotopic ffERG testing, the ffERG light stimulus is inside the folding portable darkroom and the ERG recording system is outside of the portable darkroom. The ERG electrode wire connections and the cable connecting the ERG light stimulus to the ERG recording system go through the opening created with a double closure system to ensure total darkness. We use a small handheld ffERG light stimulus to ease ERG recording inside the folding portable darkroom and record one eye at a time. A larger ffERG light stimulus can record both eyes simultaneous but will need to be held by a metallic arm requiring a larger opening at the rear of the portable darkroom and will likely require a larger darkroom.\n3. Patient preparation and retinal dark adaption\nConfirm medical reason for ffERG and obtain informed consent for examination under anesthesia, ffERG, and other procedures of interest for patient management such as retinal imaging (e.g., fundus imaging, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography) and venopuncture for genetic testing.",
    "NOTE: Most common reasons for ffERG in infants and young children include decreased vision, nystagmus, nyctalopia, visual photosensitivity, abnormal fundus, and medication with risk of retinal toxicity (e.g., vigabatrin). Important to recognize factors that are likely to affect ERG recordings including high myopia and albinism. In general, ffERG responses from infants younger than age 6 months are small and still developing, making interpretation of recorded responses difficult.\nPlace ocular anesthetic drop (proparacaine 0.5%) followed by pupillary dilation combo drop (cyclopentolate 1% + phenylnephreine 0.5%) to each eye. Repeat the combo drop to each eye 2 to 3 times with 5 minutes between drops.\n\tNOTE: The proparacaine decreases burning sensation and increases corneal absorption of the dilating drops but may have to be skipped in patients with very poor cooperation.\nPatch both eyes for retinal dark adaptation of at least 30 minutes. With eyelids gently and completely closed, place 2 regular-size self-adhesive eye occlusion patches over each eye without significant pressure on the eye.\n\t\nPlace the first patch conventionally and oriented horizontally with the wider end of the patch temporally. Place the second patch horizontally over the first patch with the wider end nasally and adjust the position typically with a tilt counterclockwise to prevent light leak nasally.\nAfter placing the eye patches over each eye, place opaque black tape horizontally across to cover both eyes without significant pressure on the eyes. Make a small vertical cut at the inferior edge of the black tape before placement at the location across the bridge of the nose to avoid pressure on the nose.\nPlace the black opaque relaxation sleeping mask with head headband over the patched eyes (Figure 4).",
    "NOTE: ISCEV international standard for dark adaptation is 20 minutes. Dark adaptation of at least 30 minutes is preferred to facilitate optimal scotopic ffERG recording given the retinal dark adaptation curve reaches a more asymptotic point compared to 20 minutes. Based on our experience, vast majority of infant and young children are tolerant of bilateral patching, and parental support and encouragement are critical. Explaining the purpose of dark adaptation and the benefit of reducing general anesthesia time helps the parents to understand. Parental tender loving care including cuddling, music from cell phone, and pacifier are very helpful during the dark adaptation period. Of over 120 infants and young children who underwent the method, only 2 patients could not tolerate bilateral patching for dark adaptation. Both patients were dark-adapted after general anesthesia induction instead and the ERG responses were subsequently successfully recorded using the same method.\n4. Dark-Adapted full-field electroretinogram recording in the operating room\nPrepare the operating room by placing translucent red filter films over monitors and opaque black tape over LEDs and light sources (Figure 5A-5B). Set up folding portable darkroom. Close curtains over door and window openings.\nInduce general anesthesia or sedation by anesthesiology team on bilaterally-patched patient followed by continued anesthesiology monitoring. Perform timeout to verify procedures to be performed.\nPlace ERG recording electrodes, ffERG light stimulus, a very dim red light mounted on a forehead band, topical 0.5% ophthalmic proparacaine, 2.5% ophthalmic hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (if Burian-Allen electrode is used), and sterile gauze (for wiping excess methylcellulose) close to ERG examiner position before placing the portable darkroom to enclose the head of the patient and ERG examiner (Figure 6A). The ERG examiner will be using the mounted red forehead band to perform scotopic ffERG recordings.",
    "NOTE: The red light mounted on a forehead band is modified by placing layers of red light filter films over the LEDs. The red light should be as dim as possible to allow the ERG examiner to perform the procedure so dark adaptation is maintained. Helpful for the examiner to wait a few minutes to have some of his or her own partial dark adaptation before placing the electrodes. Experienced ERG examiners tend to use very dim red light or can do the procedure by feel without any red light if Burian-Allen electrode is used.\nPlace the ground ERG electrode clip with conductive paste on one ear lobe. Snake the ground ERG electrode connection and ffERG light stimulus cable through the modified flap opening of the portable darkroom and the ERG technician connects them to the ERG system outside of the darkroom.\nClose the front opening of the portable darkroom with large binder clips. Turn off room lights and check and cover any remaining uncovered light sources with black tape.\nRemove the black mask over both eyes. Remove the black tape and patches over the right eye only and place the corneal ERG recording electrode on the right eye to record the scotopic ffERG responses using the hand-held full-field light stimulus in accordance to the ISCEV standards (Figure 6B).\n\t\nSnake the ERG recording electrode connection through the modified flap opening of the portable darkroom for the ERG technician to connect it to the ERG system outside of the darkroom. Take care to use the dimmest red light possible, and a brief period of additional dark adaptation, approximately 5 min, is recommended for recovery after lens insertion in accordance to the ISCEV standards.",
    "After checking for electrical baseline stability and ERG electrode impedance, proceed with recording of the rod responses (dark-adapted 0.01 cd·s·m-2 flash ERG), followed by the combined rod-cone responses (dark-adapted 3.0 cd·s·m-2 flash ERG and 10 cd·s·m-2 flash ERG) and the dark-adapted 3.0 flash oscillatory potential responses. Be mindful of the recommended time intervals between the light stimulus to maintain dark adaptation.\n\t\tNOTE: When a handheld ERG light stimulus is used to test one eye at a time, keep the other eye monocular patched to maintain dark adaptation during scotopic recordings of the first eye. Dawson Trick Litzkow (DTL) fiber electrode or bipolar Burian-Allen ERG corneal electrodes are typically used. The DTL electrode is better tolerated by a conscious patient and has lower amplitude-to-noise ratio compared to the Burian-Allen ERG corneal electrode. Given patient tolerance is not an issue during sedation or general anesthesia, Burian-Allen electrode is preferred for sedated ERG recordings given its superior amplitude-to-noise ratio.\nRemove the black tape and patches of the left eye and proceed with scotopic ffERG recording of the left eye following same procedures as for the first eye as in step 4.6 with the hand-held full-field light stimulus.\n\tNOTE: Recorded scotopic ffERG amplitudes tend to be mildly lower in the second recorded eye given the retinal dark adaptation of the second eye is typically affected by the ERG stimulus flashes diffusing to the eye through bone and tissue during ERG recording of the first eye.\n5. Light-Adapted full-field electroretinogram recording in the operating room\nAfter completion of the scotopic ffERG recordings, turn on all overhead room lights. Disconnect the ERG electrode connections and the ffERG light stimulus cable from the ERG recording system and snake them back to the inside the portable dark room through the modified flap opening. Remove the portable dark room.",
    "Light adapt both eyes for 10 minutes by using the overhead room lights in accordance to the ISCEV standards (background luminance 30 cd·m-2). Keep the bipolar Burian-Allen ERG electrodes in place for both eyes given the built-in eyelid speculums of the electrodes will hold the eyes open. If DTL lenses are used, use eyelid speculums to keep both eyes open with instillation of periodic lubricating eye drops to avoid corneal drying.\nConnect the ERG electrode connections and the ffERG light stimulus cable to the ERG system and proceed to record, in accordance to the ISCEV standards, the cone flash responses (light-adapted 3.0 cd·s·m-2 flash ERG) followed by the cone flicker responses (light-adapted 3.0 flicker ERG).\n\tNOTE: This completes the ffERG recording. Other diagnostic retinal imaging including OCT, fundus photos as well as venopuncture for genetic testing can easily follow while the patient remains sedated.\nSubscription Required.
