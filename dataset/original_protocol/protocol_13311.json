    "The present procedure was approved by the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee (CEEA) of the Comparative Medicine and Bioimage Centre of Catalonia (CEEA-CMCiB). The Government of Catalonia also authorized the experimental protocol (no. 11652), file identification number FUE-2022-02381434 and ID QBXQ3RY3J. Experienced practitioners, including certified veterinarians providing supervision and assistance, performed all experimentation. Piglets (Sus scrofa domestica), 4-6 days old, weighing 2.5-3.5 kg, were used for the present study. An attempt was made to balance gender distribution to avoid related biases.\n1. Sedation, intubation, and access\nInitiate sedation through a snout mask with ketamine (20 mg/kg), midazolam (0.3 mg/kg), dexmedetomidine (0.02 mg/kg), and buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg), followed by propofol (0.5 mg/kg) (see Table of Materials).\nPosition the piglet supine. Perform orotracheal intubation using a 2.5 mm cuffed endotracheal tube (see Table of Materials), using direct visualization of the trachea.\n\t\nConfirm appropriate endotracheal tube placement via direct auscultation of the lung bases.\nSet the mechanical ventilation to deliver a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, a tidal volume of 8-12 mL/kg, and an end-expiratory pressure of 4 cmH2O.\nContinuously monitor the depth of anesthesia during the protocol via heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and oxygen saturation (spO2). Adjust ventilatory and sedation parameters as necessary.\n\tNOTE: The ideal values for vitals are a HR of 130-160 bpm, BP of 75-95/60-70, and an spO2 > 85.\nMaintain sedation with 1.5% sevoflurane and fentanyl (25-200 µg/kg/min) (see Table of Materials).\nUse direct visualization to place catheters in the femoral artery (3 Fr) and vein (4 Fr) (see Table of Materials).\n\t​NOTE: These catheters will be used for medication administration and sample acquisition. As such, it is important to maintain access.\n2. CPB circuit setup and priming\nCustomize and set up the CPB circuit following the steps below (Figure 3):",
    "Shorten the tubing as much as possible, while still allowing enough distance to reach the animal from the machine.\nCreate and attach a tubing bridge that connects the outflow from the membrane oxygenator (see Table of Materials) to the inflow into the pump.\n\t\tNOTE: The bridge is vital to allow blood to continue circulating through the machine while the CAs of the animal are being performed.\nOnce all the connection points are sealed, prime the circuit with 300 mL of a heparin-saline solution (1,000 UI of heparin mixed into 1 L of saline) and 300 mL of fresh donor pig blood, followed by 3.5 mEq sodium bicarbonate, 350 UI of heparin, and 450 mg of calcium gluconate (see Table of Materials).\n\t\n\"Sweep\" the circuit by running the blood, heparin-saline, sodium bicarbonate, and calcium gluconate mixture through the entire circuit for 2 min at a rate of 0.3 L/min.\n3. Surgery and CPB initiation\nNOTE: Supplementary Figure 1 depicts the surgical materials required for cannula placement.\nExpose the left internal jugular vein and the right carotid artery to prepare for cannulation (Figure 4).\nFor cannulation, use the Seldinger or \"over-the-wire\" technique21.\n\t\nFirst, insert a needle catheter into the left internal jugular vein. Once a flash of blood is visualized, carefully insert a guide wire into the vessel and remove the needle, ensuring the wire stays in place.\nThread a dilator over the wire and into the vessel, then remove the dilator.\nWith the wire still in place, thread an 8 Fr venous cannula and slowly advance it ~4 cm into the vessel. Carefully remove the wire, ensuring the cannula remains in place.\nRepeat the Seldinger wire technique with dilation to place a 6 Fr pediatric arterial cannula (see Table of Materials) into the right carotid artery.",
    "At the time of arterial cannulation, administer a bolus of intravenous heparin (50 IU/kg) via the newly placed arterial cannula.\nOnce access is achieved, securely fix both cannulas to the animal using 3-0 poly absorbable sutures and tape to prevent inadvertent removal (Figure 5).\nConnect the cannulas to the CPB circuit, ensuring saline with heparin is added to connection points to prevent air in the circuit.\nSet the initial flow to 80-85 mL/kg/min and slowly increase it to an ultimate flow rate of 150 mL/kg/min.\n\t​NOTE: The animal can remain on the CPB for as long as the experiments require. A schema of steps 1-3 is depicted in Supplementary Figure 2.\n4. Circulatory and cardiac arrest (CA)\nTo induce CA, administer 9 mEq of KCl. Use vitals to assess complete arrest and confirm with echocardiography. Administer additional KCl as necessary.\nOnce the heart is stopped, isolate the animal from the circuit to induce circulatory arrest.\nMaintain CPB circuit flow using the previously described bridge (step 3.5) circulating at 1,500 rpm.\n5. Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR)\nOnce the appropriate CA condition (0 min, 30 min, or 60 min) has been achieved, begin eCPR resuscitation.\nReconnect the piglet to the CPB circuit.\nAdminister 3 mL of calcium gluconate (2.25 mmol/10 mL, diluted 1:2) and 6 mL of sodium bicarbonate (1 M, diluted 1:2) via peripheral arterial access, adding doses as necessary.\n\t​NOTE: Cardioversion or inotropic drugs (adrenaline or dopamine) may be used if necessary.\n6. Postoperative care\nOnce resuscitated, monitor vitals for 15 min to ensure stability.\n\tNOTE: Ideal parameters in the intensive care unit period are: HR of 100-150 bpm, BP of 75-95/60-70, and spO2 > 85.\nTransfer the animals for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).",
    "NOTE: In this study, after imaging, the animals were euthanized for histological study of the brain lesions15.
