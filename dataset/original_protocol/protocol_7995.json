    "All animals used were bred at the CICS-UBI Health Science Research Centre in accordance with the national ethical requirements for animal research and with the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals Used for Experimental and Other Scientific Purposes (Directive 2010/63/EU).\n1. Rat embryo cortex primary cell culture\nCulture medium preparation\n\t\nPrepare the Neurobasal Medium (NBM) by adding the following supplements: 2% B27, 0.5 mM glutamine, 25 µM glutamate and 120 µg/mL gentamicin. Homogenize, adjust the pH to 7.2 and sterilize the medium with a vacuum filtration step, using a 0.22 µm filter. For the neuron-glia cell culture, supplement the NBM cell culture medium with 10% of Heat-Inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (HI-FBS).\nPrepare the Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM) medium with the following supplements: sodium hydrogen carbonate 2.2 g/L, insulin from bovine pancreas 5 mg/L, D-glucose anhydrous 3.4 g/L, penicillin (12 U/mL) /streptomycin (12 µg/mL) and 10% HI-FBS. Homogenize, adjust the pH to 7.2 and sterilize the medium with a filtration step.\nPreparation of materials and equipment\n\t\nPuncture the terminal part of a 1 mL plastic micropipette tip from side to side, using a needle with a specific diameter (0.5 mm for S; 0.6 mm for M; 0.8 mm for L) and seal the opening of the tip using a flame.\nSterilize all the glassware. Throughout the dissection keep the tools used (e.g., scissors, tweezers, scalpel) immersed in 70% ethanol. Spray the materials with 70% ethanol before entering them in the laminar flow chamber.\nSet the water bath temperature to 37 °C and place the cell culture medium in the water bath before starting the procedure.\n\t\tNOTE: For immunocytochemistry assays, poly-D-lysine coating should be performed in multiwell plates containing coverslips.\nRat embryonic cortex culture",
    "Remove the rat embryos from a female Wistar rat with 15-16 days of gestation (the end of the mating, which should last 24 h, is considered the 1st day of the embryonic development). For that purpose, anaesthetize the female with ketamine (87.5 mg/kg) and xylazine (12 mg/kg) and remove the embryos. Then euthanize the female rat by cervical dislocation, following standard protocol.\nPlace the embryos in a 50 mL sterile tube, add phosphate buffer saline (PBS) until it covers the embryos and quickly take them to the culture room.\nStill inside the yolk sac, place the embryos in a Petri dish containing 25 mL of cold PBS. With the help of scissors and tweezers, break the yolk sac, remove the embryo and transfer it to another Petri dish containing also cold PBS. The PBS in the Petri dish should be enough to cover the entire embryo.\n\t\tNOTE: Be careful when opening the yolk sac to avoid damaging the embryo. In 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 we used 90 mm diameter Petri dishes placed on top of ice packs covered with absorbent paper to keep the PBS at low temperature.\nFor dissection of the embryo, transfer it to another Petri dish containing 30 mL of cold PBS. Place the embryo under a dissecting microscope and immobilize it using a tweezer. Make the initial incision parallel to the cortex, going from the ocular cavity to the end of the muzzle and be careful not to decapitate the animal.\nCarefully remove the scalp and the meninges using tweezers, in order not to damage the cortical brain tissue. Make the next incision to separate the cortex. Transfer the cortical tissue to a 15 mL tube containing 5 mL of PBS using a Pasteur pipette.",
    "Perform the mechanical digestion of the cortical brain tissue using the 1 mL plastic tips prepared in 1.2.1. Triturate 10 times with a regular pipette and repeat the process using pipettes with progressively smaller holes (L, M and S), until the chunks have fallen apart.\nAfter the mechanical digestion, centrifuge the suspension at 400 x g for 3 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the sediment with the appropriate cell culture medium previously warmed at 37 °C.\nDetermine the total number of cells present in the cell suspension (cell density) using a Neubauer chamber, make the appropriate dilutions and plate the cells. The initial cell density was defined based on a previous study5.\n\t\t\nFor a neuron-enriched culture, use 0.21 x 106 cells/cm2 as the initial cell density and maintain the cells in NBM culture medium without HI-FBS.\nFor the neuron-glia cultures use 0.14 x 106 cells/cm2 as the initial cell density and maintain the cells in NBM culture medium supplemented with 10% HI-FBS.\nFor an astrocyte-enriched culture, use 0.26 x 106 cells/cm2 as the initial cell density and maintain the cells in MEM supplemented as previously indicated.\nPlace the cells in an incubator set at 37 °C, 95% O2 and 5% CO2.\n\t\t\tNOTE: For longer culture periods, an anti-mitotic such as 27 μM 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine with 68 μM uridine should be added to suppress cell growth.\n2. Co-culture system\nPreparation of materials",
    "Heat the paraffin at 150 °C in a heating block for approximately 7 min. Keep at 150 °C until finishing the procedure. Then, with the help of a 1 mm diameter sterile glass Pasteur pipette, add a small drop over sterilized and PDL-coated coverslips. The paraffin spheres are irregular, but they have approximately 2 mm diameter. The spheres will allow the two cultures to be separated by approximately 1.25 mm.\nAs the paraffin is not sterile, place the multiwell with the paraffin spheres under ultraviolet radiation for 15 min.\nTo establish the co-culture, transfer the coverslip with the paraffin spheres using a tweezer previously immersed in 70% ethanol for 15 min.\nCo-culture\n\t\nWhen the two cultures are ready to use (i.e., after 7 days in culture under the conditions mentioned in step 1.3.8), transfer the neurons seeded in the coverslips with paraffin spheres to the wells containing the astrocytes.\n24 h before the two cultures are brought in contact, change the culture medium of neurons and astrocytes to NBM supplemented, or not, with HI-FBS, depending on the purpose of the experiment.\nAfter placing both cell types in contact, wait 8-12 h before starting the different stimuli and procedures.\n\t\tNOTE: The schematic representation of the co-culture system is shown in Figure 1.\n3. Oxygen and glucose deprivation\nCulture Medium Preparation\n\t\nFor the OGD experiments, use Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Prepare the HBSS medium with the following reagents: 1.26 mM CaCl2, 5.36 mM KCl, 0.44 mM KH2PO4, 0.49 mM MgCl2, 139.9 mM NaCl, 4.17 mM NaHCO3, 3.38 mM Na2HPO4. Homogenize and adjust the pH to 7.2. Sterilize the medium by filtration.\n\t\tNOTE: If appropriate, supplement the HBSS solution with glucose (HBSSglu+), by adding 5.56 mM glucose. For cultures submitted to OGD do not supplement the HBSS medium with glucose (HBSSglu-).",
    "OGD procedure\n\t\n7 days after seeding the cells, remove the culture medium and wash two times with HBSSglu-. After washing add the HBSSglu- cell culture medium and place the multiwell in the hypoxia chamber.\nSeal the hypoxia chamber and add a gas mix containing 95% N2/5% CO2 for 4 min with a flow of 20 L/min to remove the oxygen present inside the chamber. After this, stop the flow and place the hypoxia chamber in an incubator at 37 °C for 4 h or 6 h, depending on the extent of the intended ischemia.\nAfter the period of OGD, replace the HBSSglu- medium with the appropriate culture medium for the remaining procedures.\n\t\tNOTE: The OGD experiment aims to simulate the in vitro conditions that the cells suffer during an ischemic event, so it is important to certify that all the media used previously is removed.\n4. Immunocytochemistry assay\nNOTE: Perform the immunocytochemistry assay as previously described5.\nBriefly, to characterize the different cortical cultures, incubate the cells overnight at 4 °C with rabbit anti-GFAP (1:2000) and mouse anti-microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2; 1:500); and then 1 h at room temperature with the following secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa Fluor 546 and anti-mouse conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, both at 1:1000 dilution.\nLabel the cell nuclei by incubation with 2 µM Hoechst 33342 for 10 min at room temperature.\nMount coverslips in fluorescence mounting medium and acquire images on an epifluorescence microscope with a 63x magnification.\n5. Statistical analysis\nExpress data as percentage of the total number of cells or as a percentage of control and presented as the mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) of at least 3 independent experiments performed in triplicate.",
    "Perform statistical analysis with software (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA), using the unpaired Student’s t test. The results were considered significant when values of p < 0.05.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
