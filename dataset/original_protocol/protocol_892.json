    "All studies involving mice should be carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health regulation concerning the care and use of experimental animals and approved by the home institution’s animal care and use committee. All animals used for development of this protocol were used in accordance with the National Institutes of Health regulation concerning the care and use of experimental animals and approved by Einstein College of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee.\n**Passivation of windows**\nAdapted from http://www.mmsonline.com/articles/how-to-passivate-stainless-steel-parts.\n1. Wash the window frames with a 1% \\(w/v) solution of the enzyme-active detergent.\n  2. Place the window frames in a glass jar containing a 5% \\(w/v) solution of sodium hydroxide for 30 minutes at 70 C.\n  3. Discard the solution and rinse the window frames with deionized water.\n  4. Transfer the window frames into a new glass jar containing a 7% \\(w/v) solution of citric acid at 55 C for 10 minutes.\n  5. Rinse the window frames with sterile deionized water.\n  6. Repeat the step number 2, and rinse the window frames again with sterile deionized water.\n  \n**Preparation for Lung Window Surgery**\n7. Surgeries should be conducted in a separate area within a lab, in a hood or laminar flow cabinet. The surgical area should include three distinct zones: \\(i) preparation, \\(ii) surgery, and \\(iii) recovery. The rationale is to avoid contaminating the operative field with loose animal fur, splashes from incision site scrubbing, and bedding dust and fur from nearby cages. Surgical personnel should wear a bouffant cap, mask and clean lab coat. These should be new at the start of the surgical session, but do not need to be changed between animals. Surgical procedure must be performed under sterile conditions for each subject.",
    "8. Before beginning the surgical protocol, passivate the window frames and sterilize all instruments and all parts that will come in contact with the mouse during the surgery. Surgical instruments should be autoclaved. If multiple surgeries are performed, instruments must be resterilized by using a hot bead sterilizer.\n  9. Warm the surgical bed and turn on the bead sterilizer.\n  10. Wash hands with an antiseptic soap. \n  11. Wear sterile surgical gloves. If another animal is handled to anesthetize and prep it, gloves should be changed. If performing multiple surgeries, new gloves should be donned between animals.\n  12. Tie a 2 inch length of 2-0 silk suture to the base of the 22 gauge catheter as shown in **Figure 1**.\n  \n**Lung Window Surgery**\n13. Anesthetize the mouse with 5% isoflurane.\n  14. Apply sterile ophthalmic ointment in both eyes to prevent drying and possible corneal damage. \n  15. Administer a pre-operative injection of 10 µL \\(0.1 mg/kg) buprenorphine diluted in 90 µL of sterile PBS subcutaneously to provide sufficient perioperative analgesia.  \n  16. Shave the upper left chest incision site. Generally an area approximately 3 times the size of the proposed incision should be shaved. \n  17. Nair the mouse’s upper chest from the sternum to the left back as shown in **Figure 2**. \n  18. Intubate the mouse with the 22 gauge catheter following either the published protocol by Das et al.9 or by DuPage et al.10\n  19. Test to make sure that the lungs inflate bilaterally using the lung inflation bulb.\n  20. Tie the 2-0 silk suture around mouse’s snout, securing the intubation catheter under the mouse’s upper incisors \\(**Figure 3**).\n  21. Transfer mouse onto the heated surgical platform and place mouse in the right lateral decubitus position exposing the left thorax.\n  22. Connect the 22 gauge catheter to the ventilator.",
    "23. Let the mouse’s breathing stabilize for one minute and lower isofluorane to 3%. In order to insure maintenance of the appropriate surgical plane of anesthesia which will provide both amnestic and analgesic effects, it is important to periodically check for nervous response via a toe pinch test. The health and vitality of the mouse should also be periodically be checked by looking for continuance of the mouse’s natural respiration and for a healthy pink color to the lung tissue once the thoracic cavity has been breached. \n  24. Tape mouse’s front paws cranially, back paws caudally, and place one piece of tape down the posterior ridge to operating table for stabilization and optimal exposure as shown in **Figure 4**.\n  25. Open the sterile instruments inside the hood. \n  26. Sterilize the mouse skin with antiseptic.\n  27. Define the point implantation by measuring 7 mm laterally to the left of the sternum and 7 mm superior of last left rib.\n  28. Lift skin with the Graefe forceps and cut a 10 mm circular incision through the skin. \n  29. Isolate the main vessels and cauterized them at both ends with the electrocautery pen.\n  30. Remove soft tissue \\(mammary fat pad) and muscle overlaying the ribs.\n  31. With the Graefe forceps, pick up rib 6 or 7 toward the center of the lung \\(which can now be seen beneath the ribcage).\n  32. Insert one blade of the blunt micro-dissecting scissors with the rounded side down through the muscle between ribs 6 & 7 to breach thoracic seal. \n  33. Block the expiratory tube to the ventilator to collapse the lung. \n  34. Cut a 5 mm circular hole in the rib cage.\n  35. Make a purse-string stitch with 5-0 silk suture ~1 mm from the edge of the hole, interlacing with the ribs.",
    "36. Fit the window frame into the space with ribs/muscle fitting snuggly within the grooved edge of the window frame as seen in **Figure 5**.\n  37. Tie the suture three times in a locking knot.\n  38. Place ~100 µL of cyanoacrylate adhesive into a 1 mL insulin syringe.\n  39. Gently apply a stream of compressed air to the lung tissue for ~10-20 seconds to dry the tissue.\n  40. Grasp the outside edge of the window frame and lift the frame and the chest wall to create ample space between the surface of the lung and the underbelly of the window frame.\n  41. Use the insulin syringe to place a small amount of cyanoacrylate adhesive along the entire underbelly of the ring.\n  42. Inflate the lung by increasing the positive end expiratory pressure \\(PEEP) on the ventilator.\n  43. Gently press the window frame onto lung tissue and hold for 10-20 seconds.  \n  44. Dispense the remainder of the cyanoacrylate adhesive in the syringe onto a rectangular coverslip, forming a 5 mm drop.\n  45. Using the Vacuum Pick-Up System with Pump , pick up the 5 mm coverslip, dip it into the cyanoacrylate adhesive and scrape off the excess against the edge of the cover glass three times.\n  46. Place the coverslip into the window frame recess bringing it in contact with the exposed lung surface and keep gentle pressure applied until the cyanoacrylate adhesive is set \\(at least 25 seconds). \n  47. Lower isoflurane to 0%.\n  48. Use 5-0 silk suture to place a second purse-string stitch <1 mm from the cut edge of the dermis surrounding the window.\n  49. Tighten the suture and use both Graefe forceps to tuck the skin under the top rim of the window. Cinch the purse string stitch and tie using three locking knots.",
    "50. Remove the residual air from the thoracic cavity by inserting a new sterile insulin syringe just under the xiphoid process pointing towards the left shoulder to penetrate through the diaphragm and drawing back the plunger \\(see **Figure 6**).\n  51. Remove tape from all paws and back.\n  52. Cut the 2-0 silk suture tying the intubation catheter to the snout, but allow mouse to continue being ventilated with 100% oxygen. \n  53. When the mouse is nearly ready to wake up \\(starting to twitch and move), extubate the mouse and move to a clean cage.\n  \n**Post-surgical Recovery**\n54. Continue to allow the mouse to recover under a under heat lamp.\n  55. If the animal displays any signs of distress \\(inability to resume normal respiration, lack of mobility, etc.), it should be euthanized following approved protocols.\n  56. Once the mouse becomes more active, inject with another dose of 10 µL buprenorphine for analgesic. Mice need be monitored for several hours after surgery. \n  57. Add 10 mL of oral antibiotic solution in 250 mL of drinking water.\n  58. Check the health and condition of the mouse daily. Animals should be bright, alert, and active. They should be interacting normally, eating and drinking, and have normal posture.\n  59. Provide a 10 µL \\(0.1 mg/kg) buprenorphine injection daily. \n  60. Apply antibiotic ointment every day or two to skin surrounding the implanted window to aid in healing of the skin around the window frame."
