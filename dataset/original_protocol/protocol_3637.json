Experimental workflow\nDetermine the stereotaxic coordinates\nTiming: 30 min\nThe skull sutures are used to determine the two landmarks, the bregma and lambda (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). The bregma point is formed by the intersection of the coronal and sagittal sutures, whereas the lambda point is formed by the intersection of the sagittal and lambdoid sutures. Stereotaxic coordinates for specific brain regions can be easily determined using a brain atlas (for example, The mouse brain in stereotaxic coordinates, by Paxinos and Franklin) (Franklin and Paxinos, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). This atlas provides the medial-lateral (X), rostral-caudal (Y), and dorsal-ventral (Z) distances from the bregma when its position is assigned the coordinates (X, Y, Z) = (0, 0, 0).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/562-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Procedure to determine the stereotaxic coordinates\n(A) Illustration indicating the bregma and lambda regions on the mouse skull.\n(B) Stereotaxic coordinates for the hypothalamic perifornical area in a mouse brain atlas (Franklin and Paxinos, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]).\nDetermine the stereotaxic coordinates of a targeted brain region using a mouse brain atlas (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). The coordinates for the hypothalamic perifornical area are (0.47, −0.7, 4.75).\nNote: There are at least two methods to determine the z coordinate. One utilizes the distance from the bregma on the skull surface, while the other uses the distance of the targeted region from the pia surface. In the former case, we use the scale provided in the brain atlas. For the latter, we measure the distance between the pia and the targeted region on the atlas map to calculate the actual distance.",
    "Critical: Before administering a viral injection, it is recommended that one injects a dye using a different set of animals. After dye injection, please confirm the accuracy of the determined stereotaxic coordinates on brain sections. If necessary, one can adjust the coordinates to improve the accuracy.\nStereotaxic surgery\nTiming: 1 day\nDisinfect the microsyringe needle with 70% ethanol.\nAnesthetize an adult male Ucn3-Cre mouse with 2% isoflurane in the induction chamber.\nHang the mouse’s front teeth on the hole and cover the nose with the anesthesia mask connecting to the isoflurane anesthetizer (Figure.2B[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nPut an ear bar on the head.\nFix the head to the stereotaxic frame.\nWipe the head with an alcohol swab and shave the hair.\nUsing a scalpel, cut the scalp approx. 0.5 cm along the midline.\nRemove the periosteum with a cotton swab.\nAdjust the nose height by moving the nose clamp vertically to ensure that the heights of the bregma and lambda were at the same level.\nLower the microsyringe so that its tip touches the bregma, and read the height scale.\nMove the microsyringe to the lambda position.\nAs in step 8a, read the height scale.\nReturn the microsyringe to the bregma position. Adjust the nose level so that the bregma and lambda heights are the same.\nMove the microsyringe in the rostro-caudal and medial-lateral directions towards a targeted coordinate.\nLower the microsyringe, mark the drilled position using a marker if necessary, and drill the skull surface to make a hole of approximately 1-mm diameter.\nNote: When accidental bleeding occurs, apply pressure on the hole with a cotton swab to stop bleeding.\nFill the microsyringe with the viral solution.",
    "Note: Injection needles can be easily clogged. Please confirm that the viral solution is released from the needle when pushing the plunger. After that, wipe off the solution with a cotton swab.\nLower the microsyringe to the targeted z-coordinate.\nInject 0.25 μL of viral solution (1 × 1013 copies/mL) at a flow rate 0.1 μL/min and leave the needle in place for 3 min after injection.\nSlowly pull out the microsyringe to prevent the backflow and suture up the incision.\nApply isodine solution and then xylocaine gel on the wound.\nNote: Please keep this order because xylocaine gel makes a barrier to antisepsis when administered prior to isodine solution (Doshi et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nLeave the mouse on a heated pad until it awakens.\nHouse the mouse alone in a home cage for 4 weeks until behavioral testing.\nCritical: Please refer to institutional guidelines for specific instructions on aseptic and analgesic managements.\nCritical: The fixation of the head is a very important step for accurate stereotaxic injection.\nHabituation and weight measurement\nTiming: 2–3 days\nThis procedure is performed in order for animals to habituate to the testing environments.\nTransport animals in their home cages to a behavioral testing room or to its front chamber a few days prior to beginning the behavioral testing.\nPlace the cages on a rack and leave for 2–3 h.\nReturn the animals to their breeding room.\nRepeat the above steps for at least 2 days.\nOn the last day of habituation, weigh the animals and determine the volume of CNO that will need to be injected.\nCritical: Behavioral results are influenced by stress and novel experiences. It is important to carry out this procedure in the same way as in the day of testing.",
    "Critical: Behavioral tests should be performed within a fixed time period of the day. It is better to perform the tests during the dark phase to avoid disturbing the animals’ sleep. However, this might not be possible in animal experimental facilities. In this case, we are going to perform the tests during the initial few hours of the light phase, from 9:00 to 13:00 (12 h light-dark cycle, lights on at 8:00).\nOpen field/novel object test\nTiming: 2–4 h\nBoth open field and novel object tests can be used for evaluating animal anxiety (Belzung and Le Pape, 1994[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Calhoon and Tye, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). These tests can be sequentially performed on the same day (Anthony et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Dietrich et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Horii-Hayashi et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]), which can save time and evaluate behavioral responses to novel environment and novel objects.\nAnxious animals prefer to stay along the edges and the corners of the enclosure and tend to avoid the center of the field, which is frequently accompanied with decreased locomotion (Calhoon and Tye, 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). Similar to the open field test, high anxiety decreases object investigation time represented by sniffing and stretch-attend posture behaviors toward the object (Ren et al., 1981[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]).\nThe following procedure describes how to perform the open field test followed by the novel object test using chemogenetically activated mice. However, this protocol can also be applied to animals subjected to other manipulations. Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] shows behavioral categories, parameters, and analysis methods in the open field and novel object tests.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_562_3.csv\nPrepare the required volume of diluted CNO solution immediately before the test:",
    "Calculate the volume of the diluted CNO solution required. When administering 1 mg/kg of CNO to mice, the stock solution (2 mg/mL) is diluted 20 times to obtain a final concentration of 0.1 mg/mL, of which 100 μL is injected per 10 g of a mouse’s body weight (e.g., 250 μL of the diluted solution should be injected into a mouse weighing 25 g).\nDilute the stock solution (2 mg/mL) with saline. Saline is used for control animals.\nNote: The CNO concentration of 1 mg/kg is recommended for the first trial.\nTransport animals to the experimental room in the same way as during the habituation period (step 20).\nPlace the cages on a rack and leave them for at least 30 min before commencing testing.\nUsing a photometer, adjust the brightness in the open field box to 100 lx. Intraperitoneally inject the CNO solution (1 mg/kg) or saline 15 min prior to the test and return the mouse to their home cage.\nNote: Intraperitoneally injected CNO (3.5 mg/kg) reaches cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue at 15‒30 min after the injection (Jendryka et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]).\nNote: Duration between CNO injection and behavioral testing should be the same for all of the mice.\nStart behavioral testing\nOpen field test: Start the video recording, put the mouse in the corner of the open-field box, and leave for 10 min.\nReturn the mouse to its home cage. Clean the field with the diluted hypochlorite solution and fix a novel object at the center of the field using double-sided tape (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/562-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Open field/novel object test\n(A) Open field test followed by a novel object test using the same box.\n(B) Examples of novel objects.",
    "Novel object test: Start video recording, put the mouse in a corner of the field, and leave for 10 min.\nReturn the mouse to the home cage.\nNote: It is recommended to use the following shaped objects, column, conical, or spheroidal (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]B). Because these shapes are uniform, one can easily surround and determine the object area with a circle on the behavioral software, while one would have difficulty in the accurate surrounding of ununiformed-shape objects with a mouse pointer. Besides, anxious mice sometimes stay at a particular corner in the box. In that case, they would see a limited aspect of the objects from one angle, which might generate redundant differences in individual animals. A uniformed shape can resolve this problem because mice can see the same scene wherever they stay in the box.\nNote: Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1] shows examples of stretch-attend posture during single object burying test. A similar behavior could be observed in the novel object test. Please refer to the movie.\nCritical: Do not put the mouse in the center of the box in both tests.\nCritical: It is recommended to avoid using shiny materials as novel objects, as this could cause bias depending on the way the light hits them.\nCritical: Use the same object consistently, so that the measured values can be compared.\nCritical: Limit to one behavioral test per day, except for open field/novel object tests.\nCritical: Do not repeat open field/novel object tests using the same animals.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S1. Stretch-attend\nposture and burying behaviors during the single object burying test, related to steps 49 and 50\nThe movie shows examples of stretch-attend posture (SAP) and burying behaviors. The upper line and bottom line of view are recorded from overhead and side-view cameras, respectively.",
    "Single object burying test\nTiming: 2–4 h\nThe following procedure describes how to perform the single object burying test. One should keep at least a 1-day interval between the former and the present tests to relieve animals’ stress. Ethologically, burying and risk assessment in rodents are categorized into defensive behavior (Blanchard et al., 1991[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; De Boer and Koolhaas, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Horii-Hayashi et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Koolhaas et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). Activation of hypothalamic Ucn3 neurons increases both behaviors (Horii-Hayashi et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]). This test directly measures burying action and concurrently enables the evaluation of investigatory behaviors, including risk assessment and sniffing. This point is different from the marble-burying test, in which burying activity is evaluated by counting the number of buried marbles. Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] shows behavioral categories, parameters, and analysis methods in the single object burying test.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_562_4.csv\nOptional: The number of stretch-attend postures is also countable. However, the discrimination of the end of burying action and the withdrawal following the posture is difficult, especially in CNO-treated animals (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]).\nDilute the CNO stock solution in the same manner as described above (step 25) and transport animals in the same way as in the habituation period (step 20).\nPlace the cages on a rack and leave them for at least 30 min before commencing testing.\nAdjust the brightness to 5 lx using a photometer for mouse cage recording (approximately the same brightness as in breeding conditions).\nPrepare new cages containing bedding material at a height of up to 4 cm from the floor.\nIntraperitoneally inject CNO solution (1 mg/kg) or saline 15 min prior to the test and return them to the home cage.\nNote: Duration between CNO injection and behavioral testing should be the same for all of the mice.",
    "Field exploration session: Start video recording, put the mouse in the new cage, and leave for 10 min.\nReturn the mouse to the home cage.\nFix a novel object in a corner of the cage.\nNovel object session: The mouse is placed in the cage and left for 15 min.\nReturn the mouse to the home cage.\nCritical: When using the same animals as in the open field/novel object tests, use an object that is different from that used in the novel object test.\nCritical: When the field exploration session (step 35) is skipped, mice tend to utilize the time for field exploration during the novel object session (step 38).\nMarble-burying test\nTiming: 1–2 h\nThe marble-burying test is simple, easy to perform, and widely used for evaluating repetitive/stereotypic behaviors and the effects of anxiolytic drugs (Fodor et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Thomas et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib20]). One should keep at least a 1-day interval between the former and the present tests to relieve animals’ stress. The procedures given below describe how to perform this test. However, it is also notable that burying is a natural and innate behavior in rodents. Thus, result interpretation does not always provide a single conclusion; rather, they depend on the animal models and types of treatments used (De Boer and Koolhaas, 2003[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; de Brouwer et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). Table 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl3] shows a behavioral category, parameter, and analysis method in the marble-burying test.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_562_5.csv\nDilute the CNO stock solution in the same manner as described above (step 25) and transport animals in the same way as in the habituation period (step 20).\nPlace the cages on a rack and leave them for at least 30 min before commencing testing.",
    "Adjust the brightness in the testing room to 5 lx using a photometer (approximately the same brightness as in the breeding conditions).\nPrepare new cages containing bedding material placed up to a height of 4 cm from the floor, and align 24 glass marbles (6 × 4) at specific intervals (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/562-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Marble-burying test\n(A) An example of a cage for the marble-burying test.\n(B) An example of a marble-burying cage covered with an upside-down stainless steel lid.\n(C) Illustrations indicating the criteria for buried marbles.\nInject the CNO (1 mg/kg) or saline solution intraperitoneally 15 min prior to the test and return the mouse to its home cage.\nPlace the mouse in a cage containing glass marbles, cover the cage with an upside-down stainless steel lid, and leave for 30 min (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B).\nCarefully return the mouse to its home cage so that the bedding material is not scattered.\nCount the number of marbles that remain unburied and thus calculate the number of marbles buried.\nNote: The criterion for considering a marble to be buried is that more than two-third of it is covered with bedding material (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]C).\nBehavioral analysis\nTiming: 1–2 weeks\nOpen field test\nAssign 30% of the open field as the center area using TopScan LITE software.\nMeasure the behavioral parameters listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] with the same software.\nNovel object test\nAssign a 1-cm-diameter area around the novel object as the object area with the TopScan LITE software.\nMeasure the behavioral parameters listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1], except for the number of stretch-attend posture movements, using the same software.\nExperimenters blinded to the animal groups calculate the number of stretched approach posture movements.",
    "Note: Each time a mouse places its nose less than or equal to 1 cm from the novel object, it is defined as a sniffing event.\nNote: A stretch-attend posture is defined as when the mouse lowers its back and stretches its neck towards an object while either standing still or moving forward without moving its hind paws.\nSingle object-burying test\nAssign a 1-cm-diameter area around the novel object as the object area using TopScan LITE.\nMeasure the behavioral parameters listed in Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2], except for the duration of burying, using the same software.\nThe duration for which a mouse is engaged in burying behavior is measured by experimenters who are blinded to the animal groups.\nNote: Each time a mouse places its nose less than or equal to 1 cm from the novel object, it is defined as a sniffing event.\nNote: Burying is defined as the action in which a mouse replaces or push bedding material toward a novel object, regardless of whether the object is covered (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]). Although mice frequently dig at the corner of the cage with their back to the object, it is not counted as burying behavior.\nMarble-burying test: Data are expressed according to the number of marbles buried.\nCritical: After behavioral testing, it is critical to histologically confirm the accuracy of the viral injection and reporter gene expression under a fluorescent microscope."
