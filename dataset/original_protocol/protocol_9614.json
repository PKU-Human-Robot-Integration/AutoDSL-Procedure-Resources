    "1. Collecting the citrus budwood samples to ship\nSend Technology Evolving Solutions a spreadsheet of tree information for them to load into their web server (eventually, the user will create new trees).\nUse the phone app TES tracker to select a tree, and hold a near-field communication (NFC) collar tag to the phone to load the tree information to the tag.\nInsert three to four citrus budwood samples into the BTE-compatible plastic bag carrier, and close with the lid.\n\t\nEnsure that the length of the budwood does not exceed 8 in and is not less than 5 in.\n\t\t\nIf the length is greater than 8 in, use a sterile disposable razor blade or pruning shears decontaminated with 10% bleach solution (1% sodium hypochlorite) to make it shorter.\nIf the length is less than 5 in, collect a different budwood sample to put into the bag.\nEnsure that any axillary growth or large thorns are removed by hand or using 10% bleach-sanitized cutting tools (1% sodium hypochlorite).\n\t\tNOTE: This step is important so that the budwood is easier to maneuver in the opening of the chamber.\nEnsure that there are no budwood samples that have curved features. If they do, remove them using 10% bleach-sanitized cutting tools (1% sodium hypochlorite), and place in the BTE bags only the straight portions of the sample.\n\t\tNOTE: Curved budwood is very difficult to maneuver into the instrument, resulting in uneven bark striping.\nUse the phone app TES tracker to scan the NFC collar tag of the tree and link it with the NFC clip tag on the sample bag.\nPay attention to the thickness of the budwood as that determines how the operator will strip the phloem-rich budwood bark inside the BTE chamber.",
    "If the budwood has a thickness below 0.20 in, be careful while stripping the budwood because the high-velocity spinning threads in the chamber will pulverize the whole budwood to its core, beyond the bark layer and into the non-phloem-rich tissues of wood and pith.\nSelect thicker budwood because it is easier to strip the bark tissues while avoiding the non-phloem-rich budwood tissues.\nPlace the samples into an insulated shipping container with a few ice packs.\n2. Setup in the fume hood\nNOTE: It is preferred to operate the BTE inside a fume hood. This will reduce the risk of plant tissue cross-contamination and lab contamination.\nDisinfect using a 10% (1% sodium hypochlorite) spray bottle.\n\t\nSpray the surface of the hood, and let the bleach sit for around 1 min before wiping it with a paper towel.\nSpray a paper towel with the bleach solution. Wipe the TE base, weight scale components (scale, air shield, and tower), and a marker pen.\nUnwrap a syringe set for the number of samples to be processed, and place them inside a covered cardboard box.\nHave a pack of swabs available outside of the hood in case they are needed.\nPrepare the weight scale.\n\t\nRemove the weight tower from the scale, and hold the power button to turn it on. Place the tower on the center of the scale after the scale displays 0.\nSlide the weight scale air shield over the front of the scale.\nPrepare the tissue extractor base by flipping the switch on the back. Ensure the switch on the left side of the box is pressed down on the top. Wait for a blinking green LED, which indicates that the chamber is ready.\n3. Set up the cleaning stations (Supplementary Figure S1).\nPlace 1 L of water in the ultrasonic cleaner.",
    "Wrap two trash bags over the top of the ultrasonic cleaner.\nPour ~5 L of 10% bleach (1% sodium hypochlorite solution) into the ultrasonic cleaner.\nFill the water tub with enough water to submerge a chamber.\nTurn on the air compressor and open the valve.\nSet up a backdrop to catch the liquid while the chamber is drying.\n4. Processing the material for the BTE for citrus budwood bark stripping\nLoad the chamber onto the BTE Base.\n\t\nPrepare the BTE Chamber.\n\t\t\nAttach an empty sample bag to the back of the chamber. Use two O-rings to secure the empty bag to the back nozzle of the BTE chamber.\nInspect the blade for signs of wear or damage, such as cuts forming on the blade where it continues into the plastic or cuts forming on the tip. Ensure the arrow on the blade lines up with the single lock symbol.\nEnsure the air release on the bottom of the chamber is turned toward the O symbol. Place the clear lid over the chamber opening, and slide the clear BTE slide onto the chamber using the track on the right of the chamber. Push the lock on the bottom of the chamber as far as it can go into the slide. Ensure the plunger cap is mounted on the top of the slide.\nPlace the chamber on the BTE base with the BTE base's nozzle protruding into the back of the chamber. Wait for the blue LED to blink, indicating that the placement is successful.",
    "Load the sample onto the BTE base by moving the white sticker on the NFC clip tag to a Z on the right side of the box. Move the tag in a slow circular motion on Z until the yellow light starts blinking. Attach the sample to the BTE base, and ensure that the sample bag has no holes in it; if there is a hole, patch it with tape. Place the O-ring over the sample bag to secure it to the front of the BTE nozzle.\nLoad the unused syringe set.\n\t\nTare the syringe set. Place the unused syringe set onto the weigh scale tower. Remove the syringe set when a red light begins flashing or the scale displays 0.\nRemove the plunger from the syringe with the filter. Ensure the fluid is in the bottom (non-filter) syringe. Place the plunger aside on a paper towel or on the tower where the black plunger is not touching any surfaces.\nAttach the syringe to the slide exit port by pressing the exit port into the syringe and turning 90°.\nProcess the budwood sample.\n\tCAUTION: BTE has high-velocity moving parts. All operation needs to occur inside a fume hood. All users should use protective eyeglasses, earmuffs (earplugs), and all other personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves and lab coats.\n\t\nPress the top black button to start the machine. Press a second time to stop the motor at any time during processing.\n\t\tNOTE: The box has speed and temperature sensing to ensure it functions properly.\nGrab one budwood stick through the bag, and put it through the top of the BTE nozzle.",
    "Grab the budwood stick on the other side of the chamber with the other hand, and slowly inch down into the blade. Listen for a gentle buzzing sound indicating that the budwood is being stripped of its bark. Slowly move the budwood back and forth while rotating it.\n\t\t\nIf a loud, aggressive chopping sound is heard, quickly move the branch to the top and/or press the top button to stop the motor. To stop the motor, use the right-side switch to finish processing (see step 4.4.3.2).\nIf no material is coming out of the exit when cutting, then the chamber has a clog. Turn off the motor, remove the slide plunger cap, and use the plastic of the swab to push the clog out the exit of the machine. Use the right-side switch to finish processing: Up = Forward cutting; Middle = Motor off; Down = Reverse Cutting.\nRepeat step 4.4.2 and step 4.4.3 for the remaining branches.\n\t\tNOTE: A general indicator that enough budwood bark has been stripped is when 25% of the syringe has been filled with plant tissue. Graft-transmissible pathogens of citrus could be unevenly distributed in the tree. Therefore, three to four budwood samples are collected from around the citrus tree canopy. It is important for every budwood sample in the BTE carrier bag to contribute to the final ground tissue sample to ensure that a full tree representative sample will be tested for pathogens.\nPress the top black button to stop the processing. Wait for the light to begin flashing yellow again.\nVerify the sample weight.\n\t\nRotate the syringe 90°, and pull it down to detach. Place the plunger back on the syringe, and place the syringe on the tower.",
    "Wait for the scale to auto-detect the sample, and determine if it is within the proper weight range (0.25 ± 0.05 g). If the sample weight is too low (<0.20 g), repeat step 4.4; the red LED will begin blinking. If the sample weight is too high (>0.30 g), remove some of the sample material; the yellow LED will begin blinking more slowly. If the sample is within the range, the green LED will begin blinking.\nHomogenizing the budwood sample\n\t\nRemove the plunger from the syringe with the sample, push the fluid into the syringe with the sample, and re-add the plunger. The plunger pushes the buffer and plant sap through the mesh filter (withholding any large bark tissue pieces) and via the rubber tubing into the empty syringe.\nMix the sample by pushing the buffer and plant sap back and forth from one syringe to the other. Repeat ~3x-4x and until the sample becomes a homogeneous green liquid mixture.\nOnce well homogenized, push the plant sap sample into the syringe without the mesh filter, and detach the rubber tubing and the syringe with the filter from the syringe with the sample.\nExpel the plant sap sample from the syringe into a 2 mL sterile microcentrifuge tube, and store at −20 °C until further use. Use a permanent marker to label the sample with the bag number.\n\t\tNOTE: The plant sample sap from step 4.6.5 can now be processed with any of the available nucleic acid, RNA or DNA, extraction methods based on phenol-chloroform, silica column, or magnetic beads9,25,26,27 for nucleic acid extraction and purification (see step 7) and the downstream detection of graft-transmissible pathogens of citrus (see step 8).\n5. Sanitizing the BTE removable chamber",
    "CAUTION: If the buffer from the syringe set gets onto the chamber or slide, rinse, and follow all the safety rules of the laboratory before cleaning. The syringe set contains guanidine thiocyanate. If the buffer from the syringe set comes into contact with bleach, it will create cyanide gas.\nPerform the following steps after the 10th sample is processed in the chamber. Note that the green LED will continue blinking instead of moving to blue blinking.\nDisassemble the BTE chamber to clean all the possible contaminants; remove the clear plastic cover, clear the chamber slide, and clear the clog port on the chamber slide.\nTurn the air release valve on the bottom of the chamber to the open position (open padlock mark). Place the chamber components into the set-up ultrasonic cleaner (see step 3.1). Place the lid under the chamber to prevent it from floating. Run the ultrasonic cleaner for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: The ultrasonic cleaning bath (5 L) can hold up to two chambers.\nRinse the chamber components in the water bath (step 3.4) for at least 30 s. Move the chamber components to the drying station.\n\tCAUTION: Drying will cause fast-moving parts within the chamber, loud noises (~85 decibels [dB]), and possible splashing. All users should use protective eyeglasses, earmuffs (earplugs), lab coats, and all other PPE as required by the safety rules of the operating laboratory.\nDry the BTE chamber.\n\t\nPosition the air gun in line with the groove of the upper opening of the chamber (where the slide would typically be). Press the trigger of the gun to dispense air for ~30 s.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure the opening is away from the user toward the backdrop. This should spin the blade set to remove the liquid trapped underneath it.",
    "Position the air gun toward the top nozzles of the chamber. Press the trigger of the air gun, and slowly trace three full circles of each nozzle entrance.\nPosition the air gun in the center of the BTE. Starting from the innermost point, hold the trigger down, and move until the air gun points toward where the slide would be.\nQuickly run air over the entire chamber, front and back, to get the surface water off the outside.\nDry the BTE slide.\n\t\nPosition the air gun into the plunger slot of the slide, and press the trigger to eject water out of the slide exit.\nRun an air gun along the interior surface of the slide to dry it.\nRun an air gun along the slide groove to push out water.\nQuickly run air over the entire exterior to get surface water off it.\nDry the components.\n\t\nHold the slide plunger cap and O-rings in hand, and press the trigger.\nRun an air gun over the interior surface of the lid.\nPlace the components in the chamber and slide to continue drying or reassemble them.\n\t\t​NOTE: For a high tissue-processing environment with multiple functional BTEs, a batch sanitizing system can be provided that is capable of decontaminating 10 chambers simultaneously.\n6. Disposing and sanitizing\nDispose of the syringes and rubber tubing in the designated guanidine waste container.\nDispose of any plant material in the biohazardous waste container.\nRemove the BTE chamber from the BTE base.\nDisassemble the BTE chamber and proceed to their decontamination, as described in step 5.\n7. Assessment of the tissue processing and the quality of RNA purified from the BTE citrus budwood extracts",
    "NOTE: In this protocol, we used budwood samples from 255 citrus trees to compare the time required for citrus budwood tissue processing and the quality of RNA purified from bark tissue extracts prepared by BTE (Figure 2, right side, step 1, step 5, and step 6) versus that prepared following the regulatorily approved citrus budwood tissue-processing method utilizing hand peeling and chopping, freeze-drying, pulverization, and centrifugation of the bark tissue, as described by Dang et al.23 (Figure 2, left side, steps 1-6).\nCurrent laboratory procedure: Prepare budwood samples for tissue processing as per the regulatorily approved method23.\n\t\nCarry out hand peeling and chopping of the bark tissue, freeze-drying, pulverization, centrifugation, and transfer of the plant sap to the RNA extraction tube, as described by Dang et al.23 (Figure 2, left side, steps 1-6).\nAfter hand peeling the three to four budwood samples from each tested tree, place all the budwood inside a BTE-compatible plastic bag carrier, and store at 4 °C until the BTE processing (step 7.2).\nBTE procedure: Initiate the BTE citrus budwood tissue processing (section 4, steps 4.1-4.6; Figure 2, right side, step 1, step 5, and step 6).\n\t\nUse the budwood samples stored inside the BTE carrier bags from step 7.1.2.\nExtract and purify the RNA from the plant sap obtained from the current laboratory procedure (step 7.1.1) and the BTE procedure (step 7.2.2) using the regulatorily approved semi-automated magnetic bead-based method8,23,28.\nAssess the RNA quality by measuring its concentration, purity, and integrity8,23,24,29,33,31.\n\t\nTo calculate the concentration, use spectrophotometry and optical density (OD) at a wavelength of 260 nm.\nTo assess the purity, use a spectrophotometric OD ratio of 260/280.\nTo check the integrity, use reverse transcription (RT) quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) reaction targeting the mRNA of the NADH dehydrogenase citrus gene24,32.",
    "8. Assessment of the cross-contamination and detection of citrus viruses and viroids using RNA purified from BTE citrus budwood extracts\nNOTE: In this protocol, we used budwood samples from 72 non-infected citrus trees and one tree mix-infected with viruses and viroids to assess the potential of cross-contamination between samples when processed by BTE (Figure 2, right side, step 1, step 5, and step 6) and the suitability of RNA purified from bark tissue extracts prepared by BTE to be used as a template for the RT-qPCR detection of citrus viruses and viroids.\nFirst BTE sample processing: Conduct a baseline experiment with 72 non-infected samples.\n\t\nPrepare three (A-C) BTE chambers (step 4.1.1).\nPrepare all the non-infected citrus budwood samples (1-72) in BTE carrier bags, and prepare an equal number (72) in the two-syringe BTE sample collection system, with one syringe system for each sample (step 2.4).\nSeparate the sample carrier bags and sample collection syringes into six batches (I-VI) of 12 samples each.\nInitiate the BTE citrus budwood tissue processing (step 4) following the sequence below (steps 8.1.4.1-8.1.4.6) (See Table 1, First BTE Sample Processing).\n\t\t\nFor Batch I/Samples 1-12, process 12 samples using chamber A. Sanitize chamber A after sample 12 (step 5).\nFor Batch II/Samples 13-24, process 12 samples using chamber B. Sanitize chamber B after sample 24 (step 5).\nFor Batch III/Samples 25-36, process 12 samples using chamber C. Sanitize chamber C after sample 36 (step 5).\nFor Batch IV/Samples 37-48, process 12 samples using the sanitized chamber A (step 8.1.4.1).\nFor Batch V/Samples 49--60, process 12 samples using the sanitized chamber B (step 8.1.4.2).\nFor Batch VI/Samples 60-72, process 12 samples using the sanitized chamber C (step 8.1.4.3).\nStore the BTE carrier bags with all the samples at 4 °C until use at step 8.2.",
    "Extract and purify the RNA from the 72 plant sap samples generated in steps 8.1.4.1-8.1.4.6 using the regulatorily approved semi-automated magnetic bead-based method8,23,28.\nPerform RT-qPCR for the detection of citrus viruses and viroids, as previously described8,33.\nFor the second BTE sample processing, perform a cross-contamination experiment with 70 non-infected samples and two mixed infected samples.\n\t\nPrepare three (A-C) BTE chambers (step 4.1.1).\nPrepare the mix-infected citrus budwood sample (73) in two BTE carrier bags (step 1.3) for a total number of two infected samples.\nGather the BTE carrier bags with the non-infected citrus budwood samples from step 8.1.5, except Sample 3-Batch I and Sample 51-Batch V (see sample replacement in step 8.2.4), for a total number of 70 non-infected samples.\nInclude the first BTE carrier bag with the mix-infected sample 73 in place of Sample 3 in Batch I and the second one in place of Sample 51 in Batch V for a total number of 72 samples.\nPrepare an equal number (72) in the two-syringe BTE sample collection system, with one double-syringe system for each sample (step 2.4).\nSeparate the 72 sample carrier bags and sample collection syringes into six batches (I-VI) of 12 samples each.\nInitiate the BTE citrus budwood tissue processing (step 4), following the same sequence as in steps 8.1.4.1-8.1.4.6.\n\t\tNOTE: The only difference is the replacement of Sample 3 in Batch I and Sample 51 in Batch V with the infected sample 73 (step 8.2.4) (Table 1, Second BTE Sample Processing).\nExtract and purify the RNA from the 72 plant sap samples generated in step 8.2.7 as in step 8.1.6.\nPerform RT-qPCR for the detection of citrus viruses and viroids, as in step 8.1.7.\nSubscription Required.
