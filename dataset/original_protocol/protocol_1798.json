A typical electrode uses 31 mm of polyimide tubing, 30 mm of hypodermic tubing, and 55 mm of 75 μm platinum/iridium Teflon insulated wire (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1387-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Electrode fabrication\n(A) Parts include wire, stainless steel hypodermic tubing, polyimide tubing, and cyanoacrylate glue.\n(B) Strip the insulation from a straight section of electrode for 1 mm. Distance of stripping will determine impedance.\n(C) Thread the other end of the wire through the tubing and sheath. Thread the tubing into the sheath. Align the tip so it protrudes 1.5 mm from the sheath.\n(D) Apply cyanoacrylate so it wicks into the sheath on either end.\nUse iris scissors to carefully remove 1 mm of insulation from the stimulation end to achieve impedances under 1000 Ohms (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B). For higher impedances, less insulation may be removed.\nUse a Dremel cut-off wheel to cut and file down the desired amount of hypodermic tubing. Probe the hypodermic tubing with 26G Precisionglide syringe needle to make sure the holes of both ends of the tube have not been blocked by the cutting process. Use file to smooth down both ends of the tubing. Ream the entire section of tubing using tungsten wire.\nThread the materials. Locate the stimulation end of the wire (straight) and thread the other end through the metal hypodermic and then the polyimide sheath. The metal hypodermic is threaded through the polyimide sheath (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nPull the wire so less than 1.5 mm protrudes from the polyimide on the stimulating end, with up to 25 mm on the tail end.",
    "Glue the wire into the tubing on both ends with cyanoacrylate. The Krazy Glue brand seems to wick into the tubing most effectively. Not all cyanoacrylates are equal in this attribute (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nFree insulation from the tail end by mechanical stripping. In some applications, a butane torch may be used, but if the wire is to be welded, mechanical stripping is preferred because it avoids leaving a residue that may interfere with welding.\nMeasure the impedance after removing the insulation. The ideal value is 1000 Ohms at 1 kHz but range of 100–3000 Ω will be acceptable. Typically the reference path electrode is placed in a saline solution, and a 1 kHz signal is pushed from electrode to reference using a current of 1 microamp, and the peak-to-peak voltage measurement is the impedance in megaOhms.\nStore electrodes in a conventional microelectrode storage box and sterilize them using a low heat method, plasma or gas (McEvoy and Rowan, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). The electrode should be steam durable, but the electrode boxes are typically not.\nThe length of insulation removed will dictate the impedance. Preventing irreversible reactions at the metal/brain interface will require charge densities stay within acceptable limits, and delivery of 0.5 mA through a 1 mm length of platinum or iridium with a diameter of 75 μm falls well within these limits (Shannon, 1992[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]). If the impedance measurement is too high, above 10 kOhms, or too low, under 100 Ohms, the tip must be inspected and/or replaced.\nNote: These methods have been previously reported briefly (McCairn and Turner, 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Turner and DeLong, 2000[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]).\nStimulation electrode and implantable pulse generator (IPG) implantation\nTiming: 3 h\nThis step describes implantation of stimulation electrodes to deliver stimulation into NB using an IPG (see Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] for this stage).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1387-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Implanted electrode procedure parts and process\n(A) A bone screw is installed in the bone allowing a direct path to the target of interest.\n(B) A guide tube, 23 mm long, is inserted 5 mm into the brain using a stereotaxic positioner, and aligned with the target of interest.\n(C) The electrode is inserted into the guide tube manually. The length of the electrode, from tip to polyimide tubing tail, allows the tail to be flush with the bone screw when inserted to proper depth.\n(D) The stylus is held in a second stereotaxic positioner and pushed into the guide tube. The width of the stylus requires the electrode to be advanced as the stylus advances. E. The stylus advances the electrode to depth. F. The guide tube is raised using the first stereotaxic positioner.\n(G) The stylus and guide tube are removed. The electrode is glued into the bone screw with silicone until there is a hydraulic seal.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1387-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Micro-welding\n(A) The wires are positioned with uninsulated (stripped) ends of the wire crossed at a 90 degree angle over the tips of the welding tweezers. The tweezers are masked with electrical tape except around the tips. Not shown: the tweezers squeeze the joint between the two wires creating an electrical path from one tweezer face, through both wires, to the other tweezer face. This path creates a thermocouple between the two wires which, with appropriate current pulse, will melt the two wires together. A pulse is delivered.\n(B) The two wires with a weld are shown. Scale bar = 1 mm. The non-stranded wire used in these images is 0.003” wide at its uninsulated section.\nBefore starting surgery, determine target coordinates for implantation of electrode into the NB.",
    "A preoperative MRI is optimal for determining placement. Alternatively, we have used average stereotaxic coordinates when obtaining an MRI was not practical for an animal.\nUsing a vertically oriented electrode approach, NB is accessible at the following stereotaxic coordinates: 16 mm anterior to the interaural line; 9 mm lateral to the midline; 29 mm below the surface of the cortex.\nNote: This position places the electrode 2 mm posterior to the rear margin of the anterior commissure where it crosses the globus pallidus in coronal view.\nNote: This landmark is easily viewed on coronal MRI or histological sections and implantation coordinates may be adjusted to target it more accurately in individual cases.\nNote: The vertical oriented approach in the macaque monkey minimizes disruption of cortical gray matter and is consistent with most stereotaxic frames and positioners.\nPrepare the monkey for surgery\nSolid food is withheld for 12 h before surgery.\nSedate monkey with intramuscular (i.m.) ketamine (5 mg/kg) and dexmedetomidine (0.2 mg/kg)\nOptional: the monkey may receive i.m. injections of atropine (0.04–0.06 mg/kg, im) to control secretions.\nShave surgery area comprising the scalp and subscapular area with hair clipper and scrub with Nolvasan.\nIntubate and secure endotracheal tube in location.\nCritical: make sure the tube is in place by tightening a strip of gauze around the subject’s head.\nPut the monkey prone on the surgery table.\nCritical: Use a heating pad to maintain the body temperature during surgery, aiming for 36°–38°C.\nAnesthetize with isoflurane, 3% for induction, 1.5% for maintenance delivered in 2 L/min oxygen. Monitor anesthesia by means of SpO2, Heart Rate, Respiration Rate, End-title CO2, temperature.\nAdminister ophthalmic ointment in both eyes of the animal to protect the corneas from drying and abrasion.\nSecure monkey on stereotax.\nDisinfect shaved area: clean the surgical site with antiseptic scrub.",
    "Administer lidocaine subcutaneously at the surgical site (2 cc of 2% solution).\nCut a flap of scalp through the galea to expose the bone.\nDrill a hole according to coordinates obtained from MRI.\nImplant a bone screw with a radially centered hole in it.\nCritical: The bone screw and hole should both be performed in stereotaxic vertical orientation and not orthogonal to the bone angulation and should be vertically above the desired stimulation location.\nNote: Bone screws were custom designed with Gray-Matter Research, and are 4.5 mm long, with a 1.85 mm diameter through hole. The threads are bone screw pitch, 1.25 mm spacing.\nNote: The bone screw seats well in the cranial bone and creates a minimal defect in the sealing of the cranium that can be easily sealed. It also enables later removal of the electrode should it become necessary for repositioning or MRI imaging (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nLower a 19 ga. sharp hypodermic guide tube using the manual rotational drive on the stereotaxic micropositioner. The tip should be carefully advanced at least 5 mm below the dura mater. The guide tube is advanced in stereotaxic vertical orientation, and acts as the primary targeting vector for the electrode tip. Check its orientation carefully. Measure the length of the electrode to be inserted, and the length of its wire tail (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nCritical: The guide tube for this procedure is 23 mm long, which is important for its later removal. The guide tube needs to be long enough to pass the dura, and short enough that it can be later removed while visualizing the tail end of the electrode.",
    "Insert the stimulation electrode manually into the guide tube, and push the electrode until the polyimide sheath is fully within the guide tube. Insert the stylus into the guide tube and advance electrode to appropriate depth using a clamped manipulator with Vernier scale or microdrive. The guide tube is then raised while the stylus depth is maintained (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C–2F).\nAlternatives: Use a longer guide tube in a stylus free preparation. In that scenario, advance the electrode until its shank is flush with the rear of the guide tube. Then, remove the guide tube. Advance the electrode to target depth. This approach will also work if the tail of the electrode shank will be approximately positioned at the top of the bone screw, and will thus provide its own guidance on depth.\nCheck tail length of electrode after dropping to confirm depth (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G). Glue electrode into bone screw head using one drop of quick curing silicone to stabilize the electrode in the bone screw.\nRepeat for the second electrode.\nA surgical site for the IPG is located on the back, caudal enough to avoid touching the scapula, and lateral enough to avoid touching the spine. Make a horizontal incision perpendicular to the spine. Dissect a pocket bluntly in the subcutaneous space to fit the IPG caudal to the incision.\nUse a tunneling kit to tunnel from the head surgical location to the back incision.\nNote: Large hemostats (8” or 12”) are useful surgical tools before moving to the tunneling tool.\nThe tunneling tool is advanced subcutaneously from scalp incision to IPG pocket.\nThe straw is left in the tunnel, and the pigtail wire inserted through the straw.",
    "Note: The pigtail wire is a Boston Scientific product, and contains an industry standard 8 lead connector on one end, and eight stranded wires on the other end.\nOnce the pigtail is inserted, the straw is removed.\nWelding. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nUse a Sunstone 100 ws single pulse resistance spot welder, along with its Tweezer hand piece weld attachment.\nSet the energy to 4% with a 0.45 ms pulse width.\nUse electrical tape to mask the Tweezer except where the two faces come together.\nThe electrode wire tail, and pigtail wire, both mechanically stripped of insulation, are overlaid at a 90 degree angle in between the tweezer faces so that the only current path is from one tweezer face through the joint between the wires to the other tweezer face.\nNote: Typically two people are needed to hold the Tweezer and both wires. One person holds both wires at 90 degree angles, while the other positions the Tweezer.\nThen, a pulse can be used to spot weld the wires. Wire alignment on the Tweezers is critical, and practice prior to surgery recommended. These welding settings are specific to the wire diameters and composition used in this study.\nCritical: The welding step must not be performed while the IPG is connected to avoid damage to the IPG.\nCheck channel number using a multimeter. The connectivity between the weld and the pigtail connector contacts can be used to determine which channel is attached to the electrode. A nonsterile multimeter and two sets of sterilized alligator clip wires, and two pairs of forceps, are used to find the connector contact matching each weld.\nCheck impedance.\nPlug the pigtail connector into the IPG, and place IPG into a previously created subcutaneous pocket.",
    "Test impedance using a Boston Scientific tablet, which is a specific accessory associated with their IPGs.\nNote: Impedances in the 4 kOhm range or lower are expected. Impedances above 10 kOhm indicate replacement of the electrode should occur.\nNote: Often the bone screw will need to be removed to facilitate removal, if needed. Once both electrodes are welded and verified, move on.\nPlace a drop of silicone on the skull for each of the two welds. Hold the uninsulated section of the welds in the silicone to insulate them.\nFlush head and IPG surgical sites with 3% hydrogen peroxide diluted 50:50 in 0.9% NaCl irrigation solution. Insert IPG into the subcutaneous pocket. Coil extra pigtail wire under IPG. Silk sutures may be used to secure the IPG. Subcutaneous silk sutures should be used to secure the pigtail at the cranial location to avoid pigtail creep.\nSuture both sites closed using interrupted 3-0 Vicryl for the galea (scalp) or cutaneous (back) layer, and a subcuticular running 4-0 Monocryl for skin, and apply Dermabond to the incisions.\nThe relative positions of pigtail wire, electrodes, and IPG are shown in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1387-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Schematic figure of implanted rhesus monkey\nLocations of implanted electrodes, route of pigtail wire from cranial surface to subscapular subcutaneous implantable pulse generator are shown.\nTreat the monkey post-operatively with opioid analgesics (e.g., buprenorphine) for up to 72 h, followed by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., ketoprofen) for up to 1 week.\nNote: Suspected infections around the wound margin may (rarely) require antibiotic treatment. Suspected brain edema may require treatment with steroid drugs (e.g. dexamethasone).\nStimulation electrode implantation – Stimulation through external connector\nTiming: 3 h",
    "In some preparations it is desirable to have the connector to the electrode externalized through an acrylic cap that will also be used to anchor recording chambers. This alternate approach describes implantation of stimulation electrodes to deliver stimulation into NB using an external stimulator, connected to the electrodes through a removable connector, in dental cement or acrylic.\nRepeat steps 1–21 of electrode fabrication and stimulation electrode implantation, above.\nOnce both electrodes are implanted, and wires are loose, the wires are attached to the connector via soldering. A bare piece of platinum wire is wrapped around a separate bone screw to act as the ground.\nThe wires and connector are encased in a bone-cement head cap, adhering to the screws.\nImplantation of additional screws may be needed for added stability. Alternatively, this procedure may be performed in monkeys who already have a headpost/recording cylinder implanted and covered by bone-cement. The bone cement that has been added to stabilize the electrodes then attaches to the rest of the implant.\nA cap may be added to protect the connector; all parts of the electrode are encased in acrylic at the end of the procedure.\nCombined stimulation – Neural recording\nTiming: 2 h\nMonkeys that have already had cranial implants that allow neurophysiological recordings prior to the stimulation electrode implantation (e.g., headpost and cranial well that allows insertion and removal of micro-electrodes through a craniotomy into the brain) may undergo simultaneous deep brain stimulation and neural recording with a data acquisition system such as the APM recording system. The first step in this experiment is to load the electrodes into the micro-electrode microdrive and prepare and test the neural recording system (see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] for this stage).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1387-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Trial structure for combined behavioral and neural recording",
    "Each minute consists of 45 s of behavioral trials, which may contain different events such as fixation periods, visual stimulus presentations, delay periods, and response periods, represented by different color rectangles. The number of trials that take place in each period depends on the duration of each trial (4 trials are shown in this example). Behavioral trials are interleaved with 15 s periods of stimulation, when no behavior is performed, and animals are conditioned simply to pause. Comparisons can be made between blocks of trials involving stimulation during the 15 s pause period, and blocks of trials not delivering stimulation (sham). No trials are performed during stimulation because voltage recordings are contaminated in that period.\nHead fix monkey and put recording stage on and connect to preamplifier\nTest impedance of stimulation electrode by connecting external connector to an impedance meter. The use of implanted electrodes includes the possibility of failure, and regular impedance checks are necessary to ensure connectivity (see also problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1] in Troubleshooting section).\nConnect stimulator to stimulation electrode (e.g., isolated pulse stimulator Model 2100, A-M Systems, Sequim WA).\nNote: Connect a 10 μF capacitor in series to the stimulating electrode to prevent net charge accumulation.\nAdvance the micro-electrodes into the brain (e.g., prefrontal cortex) through the cranial well and stop when neural signals have been isolated.\nStart behavioral task, implemented in the MATLAB environment e.g., as described in (Meyer and Constantinidis, 2005[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]) or equivalent. Behavioral program will trigger stimulation.",
    "Critical: During the time interval of electrical stimulation, electrical artifacts are visible in the neurophysiological data acquisition. These make recording of neurophysiological signals anywhere in the brain impossible, for a brief period of time (<1 s). It is imperative therefore that the behavioral task and data acquisition be structured so that artifacts do not interfere with recordings during task execution. At the same time, presence of artifacts in the neurophysiological recording when delivering electrical stimulation provides confirmation that the stimulation circuit is closed and the current application is effective.\nThe recommendation is to construct a recording task consisting of 45 s of trials, with 15 s pauses interleaved. During the 15 s pauses, biphasic stimulation can be delivered to one or both hemispheres at intensities up to 0.5 mA, with 100 microsecond phase length, biphasic charge balanced pulses. Good effects of stimulation have been documented at 80 pulses per second during that 15 s period (Liu et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Qi et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]).\nRetract the recording electrodes first from the recording chamber; when task is done then power off and disconnect the stimulator.\nClean cranial well with sterile saline. Remove guide tube and electrodes, clean with alcohol followed by distilled water and sterilize with UV irradiation.\nCombined stimulation/IPG – Behavioral recording (see Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6] for this stage)\nTiming: 1 h\nMonkeys that have not had cranial implants that allow neurophysiological recordings, or when obtaining behavioral measures alone is adequate, NB stimulation can be performed around behavioral recording. An example is shown in Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1387-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6. Monkey interacting with the apparatus\nMonkey performing a delayed match to sample working memory task in its home cage using a cage-mount touchscreen apparatus.",
    "Test impedance of stimulation electrode. Connections between the implanted electrodes and the IPG may fail, and regular impedance checks are necessary to ensure connectivity. The IPG system allows impedance testing remotely.\nCreate a program of stimulation. Intermittent stimulation comprises biphasic pulses delivered to one or both hemispheres at intensities up to 0.5 mA, with 100 μs phase duration. Positive effects of stimulation have been documented at 80 pulses per second during that 15 s period. The activating function is proportional to the square root of the current (McIntyre et al., 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Murasugi et al., 1993[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]; Stoney et al., 1968[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]), and currents of 200–500 microamps per pulse have been used in the macaque\nPrepare and test behavioral control system.\nApply stimulation for a period of 1 h, starting stimulation at the same time the monkey engages with a behavioral task.\nDaily sessions of stimulation during the task may alternate with sessions beginning after the 1 h of stimulation."
