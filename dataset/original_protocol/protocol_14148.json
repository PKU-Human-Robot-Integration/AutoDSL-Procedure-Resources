  "procedures": [
    "This study is conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (64th version, Brazil 2013) and in accordance with the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO), the guidelines of Good Clinical Practice, and the local institutional review board (Medisch Ethische Toetsingscommissie; M18.228393).\n1. Patient Admission to ICU and Screening\nNOTE: For screening, a digital list with minimum patient data is updated throughout the day, and inclusions and exclusions are registered. The screening list is stored in the secured hospital electronic system with exclusive access for researchers. To protect patient privacy, all physical copies of the lists are destroyed at the end of the day. Inclusion criteria are: acute and unplanned admission; and patients above the age of 18.\nScreen the patient management system for all new admissions and check whether patients meet the inclusion criteria.\nImmediately exclude readmissions, elective admissions, patients younger than 18 years of age, and those who will not be able to give informed consent.\nNOTE: We also exclude patients with a non-trauma neurological admission reason as we have established multiple patient groups in SICS-I, in which this group was hemodynamically stable and ICU admission concerned mainly neurological treatment1.\nAdd the possible inclusions to a continuously updated patient list. Use this list to plan new and repeated measurements daily based on the time of admission/inclusion.\n2. Clinical Examination 1",
    "NOTE: The first clinical examination is conducted in all patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria within 3 h after admission. This examination is performed by the student-researchers if the patient is admitted during the day shift. For patients admitted during the evening or night shifts, this first clinical examination is conducted by a member of the ICU student team and data are processed and finalized the next day by the student-researchers. For a full description of the protocol of the first clinical examination, see clinicaltrials.gov13. At the bedside, if possible, patients are asked if they consent to the clinical examination at that moment. Written informed consent is obtained later on: see Step 1.2 for instructions and Step 7 .\nPhysical examination\nStart by ensuring the required safety/isolation rules for the patient: disinfect hands and wrists following standard hospital procedures with 70% alcohol and use non-sterile gloves and a plastic apron or additional precautions such as an isolation gown during patient contact.\nIntroduce yourself and ask the patient for permission to conduct the examination if they are not sedated, conscious and adequate. Explain to the patient what is being done.\nNOTE: Formal informed consent is requested at a later stage during ICU admission or after discharge to the ward, either from the patient themselves or from the next of kin if the patient is unable. This is described in further detail in Step 7.\nRegister the hemodynamic variables heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and central venous pressure (CVP) from the bedside monitor.\nRegister the oxygen saturation (SpO2) and whether the patient receives non-invasive respiratory support or is mechanically ventilated. If so, register the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and the fraction of inspired O2 (FiO2).",
    "Determine reperfusion of the knee and sternum by pressing 10 s on the skin and letting go, then counting the number of seconds until full reperfusion.\nDetermine the subjective skin temperature by palpating the extremities with the hands and estimate if they are cold or warm.\nRecord the bladder temperature from the monitor, which shows the temperature measured by a sensor attached to an indwelling urinary catheter.\nDetermine the skin temperature on the dorsum of the foot by placing an additional temperature sensor on the middle of the dorsum and connecting it to the monitor. Reconnect the bladder temperature sensor to the monitor after this measurement.\nScore the degree of mottling if observable by using the Ait-Oufella knee scale14.\nRegister whether the patient receives sedation and, if yes, which drug, at what pump speed, and in which dosage.\nDetermine and register the patient's Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)15.\nEstimate the patient's survival in hospital, 6 months survival and ability to return to their original residence based on an educated guess and the results from this clinical examination16,17. Ask the nurse and physician for their estimations as well and register all estimations on the CRF.\n3. Clinical Examination 2\nNOTE: The second clinical examination is conducted within 24 hours after admission and includes CCUS measurements. This examination is always conducted by student-researchers trained in CCUS, and not by members of the ICU student team. In addition, in patients who meet the inclusion criteria and got clinical examination 1 but are shown later to suffer exclusively from a neurological condition (e.g., non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage), repeated measurements including CCUS are not performed, and these are ultimately excluded.\nObtain informed consent.",
    "​NOTE: Under University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG) regulations for observational measurements, per 1st of January 2016, the ultrasound images collected during clinical examination can be used without expressed consent. However, it is policy of the SICS-II study to seek informed consent from patients at the earliest possible moment while simultaneously upholding the principles of minimizing \"stress\" to the patient, increase shared decision making, and giving the patient enough time to consider participation. Since most patients are unable to provide consent early in their ICU stay, \"delayed\" consent is usually obtained. If, conversely, they are able to provide or refuse consent before or after the examinations, these will either not be carried out or all already obtained data is deleted, respectively.\n\t\nBefore starting the examination, determine if the patient is alert/conscious and able to engage with the student-researchers by determining their GCS score. Provide capable patients with an explanation regarding the examination to be conducted, and leave a standardized, written letter which they must sign.\nShould the patient not be able to be consulted for consent (due to impaired consciousness, limited mental capacity, etc.), monitor their GCS score daily and consider obtaining family consent if family members are reachable (as described in Step 7.1).\nPerform the physical examination following the steps described for Clinical Examination 1.\nPerform CCUS of the heart and the lungs.\n\tNOTE: This protocol is valid when using an ultrasound machine in the Table of Materials, the cardiac transducer for the parasternal long axis view (PLAX), and the cardiac phased array transducer for the apical four and five chamber views (AP4CH, AP5CH). For other ultrasound systems, users should consult the operating manuals of their specific device.",
    "Turn on the machine. Register the patient's anonymous study ID, start a new exam, and wait for the automatic 2D imaging mode to be displayed on the screen.\nIf the patient is clothed, unbutton their gown to expose the chest. Place new electrocardiogram (ECG) stickers and connect them to the ultrasound machine if necessary.\nConnect the ECG cable from the machine to the patient's bedside monitor. Wait for it to stabilize and register the heart rate measured by ECG in the CRF.\nWhen possible, position the patient slightly rotated on their left side. This improves the quality of both cardiac and kidney imaging.\nNOTE: Technical Considerations: Before starting the examination, click the Configure button, and set the image settings to five heart cycles, a depth of 10–15 cm, an image width of 65°, and a frequency of 1.7/3.4 MHz. Check if the correct probe is selected by clicking the Probe button.\nPut a sufficient amount of ultrasound gel on the ultrasound transducer and place the transducer on the lateral left of the sternum, between the 3rd and 5th intercostal spaces, to obtain the PLAX view in the 2D mode. Adjust the depth as needed to record images for the left ventricular outflow tract measurements and save the image.\nNOTE: The maximal width of the left ventricle should be visible with a maximal opening of the mitral valve. No muscle of the valve should be visible. Before placing the transducer on the patient's chest, warn them that the gel is cold and can feel uncomfortable, and that they will feel some pressure (especially around the sternum when recording images for the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT). Be aware in patients that have costal fractures some places should be avoided as this may be uncomfortable for the patient).",
    "In the 2D mode, adjust the depth to 15–20 cm, and place the transducer over the apex of the heart, caudal to the left areola. The AP4CH view is obtained, with all four chambers clearly visualized. Save the image.\nRoll the trackball so that the cursor is on the boundary between the tricuspid valve and the right ventricle wall to obtain the Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE). Press the M-Mode button to obtain the correct image and save it when defined sinus waves are seen. Save the image.\nPlace the cursor over the tricuspid valve with the trackball. Decrease the width of the image to increase the number of frames per second, necessary for the RV S' quality. Press the TVI button first, and then the PW button, to obtain the correct image for the RV S' and save it.\nFrom the AP4CH view, tilt the transducer upwards (i.e., flatten it) to obtain the AP5CH view and get the aortic root on screen. Save the image.\nPlace the cursor right above the aortic valve and press the PW button to obtain the LVOT pulse wave Doppler. Place the cursor at exactly the same place where the LVOT diameter was measured. Save the image with the highest quality (sharp Doppler wave boundaries, hollow on the inside and well distinguishable from retrograde or mitral flow). These will later be used to calculate the velocity time integral (VTI), and subsequently the CO.\nNOTE: Always try to obtain at least three flow waves for every measurement. In case of an irregular rhythm, at least five waves should be saved.",
    "Proceed to the lung ultrasound using the same phased array cardiac transducer and changing the settings to a frequency of 3.7 MHz, depth to 15 cm, and record the images only during 2 heart cycles. Place the transducer in 6 different locations, with the light of the transducer at 12 o'clock, according to the BLUE protocol18. Make sure to always obtain the image in the same sequence, to avoid confusion when viewing images later.\nObtain a superior anterior mid-clavicular view of the lungs by placing the transducer on the intercostal space of the 2nd and 3rd rib on both sides. Save the images for each side.\nObtain an inferior anterior mid-clavicular view of the lungs by placing the transducer 2 to 3 ribs lower. Save the images for each side.\nObtain a mid-axial view of the lungs by placing the transducer under the patient's arm pits. Save the images for each side.\nOnce cardiac and pulmonary imaging is complete, wipe excess gel off the patient's chest.\nPerform CCUS of the IVC and the kidney.\nClick the Probe button and use the trackball to change the active probe to the convex/curvilinear array (abdominal) transducer for the IVC and kidney examination. The light of the transducer, which may be used for orientation, should be at 12 o'clock for both measurements.\nUsing the 2D mode and with settings set to a depth of 10–20 cm, and a frequency of 2.5/5.0 MHz, place the transducer just below the xiphoid process and displace it approximately 2 cm to patient's right. The IVC should become visible. Save the image.\nPlace the cursor just above the superior wall of the IVC and outside the lumen using the trackball and press the M-Mode button. Save the image.",
    "For the renal ultrasound, start with the 2D mode and adjust the settings to a depth of 10–15 cm, and a frequency of 2.2/4.4 MHz. Place the transducer dorsal and caudal of the rib cage. Get the chosen kidney central in the image and save it.\nNOTE: Make sure to place the transducer as dorsal as possible to filter out liver tissue and bowel loops. For reliable measurements of the kidney length, the borders of the kidney should be clearly visible, and the distance between the central sinus complex (the more echogenic center of the kidney) and the cortex should be similar throughout the image.\nPress the Color button to get a color Doppler image of the kidney and determine flow in the renal vasculature. Place the cursor over any artery at the corticomedullary junction in the center of the kidney where Doppler flow is clearly visible using the trackball.\nAdjust the cursor angle and press the PW button. Adjust the signal amplitude and the contrast in Active Mode if necessary. Save the image.\nDetermine if there is also sufficient venous signal (i.e., flow visible in the negative half of the y axis), which is required for later measurements. If not, repeat Step 3.4.5 and place the cursor over a vein at the corticomedullary junction in the middle where venous flow is visible. Save the image.\nOnce all imaging is complete, disconnect all cables, wipe excess gel off the patient and the transducer, redress or cover the patient and clean the transducer with ultrasound-approved disinfecting wipes.\n4. Clinical Examinations 3 and 4\nNOTE: The third and fourth clinical examinations are conducted on days 3 and 5 after admission if the patient is still in the ICU (i.e., no death or transfer to the ward took place).\nPhysical examination",
    "Conduct the physical examination following the steps described for Clinical Examination 1.\nCCUS of the heart and the lungs\nConduct the ultrasonographic examination of the heart and lungs according to Step 3.3. Obtain LVOT only once since it is a static measurement, and therefore does not have to be recorded in Clinical Examination 3 and 4.\nCCUS of the IVC and the kidney\nConduct the ultrasonographic examination of the IVC and kidney according to Step 3.4. Obtain kidney length only once since it is a static measurement, and therefore does not have to be recorded in Clinical Examination 3 and 4.\n5. Measurements and Analysis of the Ultrasound Examinations\nNOTE: The images saved during the clinical examination are used after each examination to measure the desired variables. The measured values are registered on the CRF and transcribed to an online clinical patient data management system. Images in which measurements are performed and visible should also be saved, in addition to the original images which will later be used for validation.\nLVOT measurement\nClick the Probe button to select the cardiac transducer in order to start the measurements.\nUsing the image saved in Step 3.3.5, pause the image when the valves are fully open.\nClick the Measure button, and then select the Cardiac-Dimension-LVOT options on the right-side menu, to start the measurement.\nOnce the cursor appears, choose two points at the base of the aortic valve, one on each side of the lumen, from inner to inner edge, during end-diastole. Save the image.\n\t\tNOTE: The LVOT measurement must be done and saved before the CO measurement, so that this can be automatically determined by the machine.\nCO measurement\nUsing the image saved in Step 3.3.10, trace the left ventricular output. Adjust the horizontal sweep to 100 cm/s.",
    "Select three well-shaped, hollow waves with clear borders which align with the ECG. Click the Measure button and use the trackball to select the Cardiac-Aortic-LVOT Trace options.\nTrace the waveform line, starting and ending at the baseline, and the ultrasound machine automatically calculates the CO. Repeat this for three waves and save this image.\nNOTE: In case of an irregular rhythm, record the average CO value obtained for five waves.\nTAPSE\nUsing the M-mode image saved in Step 3.3.7, click the Measure button, and use the trackball to select the Cardiac-Dimension-TAPSE options on the right-side menu.\nPlace the cursor first on the lowest point of a well-defined sinus wave and then on the highest point. The difference between the two (the TAPSE) should appear on the top left corner of the screen. Do this in three sinus waves and take the average of the three TAPSE measurements. Save the image.\nRight Ventricular Systolic excursion (RV S')\nUsing the image saved in Step 3.3.8, click the Caliper button and place the cursor on the highest peak of a well-defined curve. Do this in three curves and take the average. Save the image.\nKerley B-line artifact assessment\n\tNOTE: The horizontal A-lines which represent a normal lung surface can be used for reference in the detection of B-lines. These arise from the pleura and are hyperechoic compared to A-lines.\n\t\nAdjust the contrast of the image and/or the gain. B-lines are not always immediately visible in the saved images.\nDetermine and register the number of Kerley B-lines for each of the six images obtained. Since the number of B-lines is not saved in the machine, it must be immediately registered on the CRF (between 0 and 5).\nIVC diameter and collapsibility",
    "Click the Probe button to select the abdominal transducer in order to start the measurements.\nUsing the 2D image saved in Step 3.4.2, click the Caliper button and measure the distance between the two walls of the IVC at 2 cm from the where it enters the right atrium. This is the IVC diameter, save this image.\nUsing the M-mode image saved in Step 3.4.3, click the Caliper button and measure the IVC expiratory and inspiratory diameters. Save this image.\nNOTE: The expiratory and inspiratory diameters of the IVC are the maximum and minimum diameters seen in the M-mode image, respectively.\nKidney length and blood flow\nUsing the 2D image saved in Step 3.4.4, click the Caliper button and draw the longest line spanning from the caudal to the cranial ends of the renal cortex. This is the kidney length in cm, register this finding in the CRF. Save this image.\nUsing the Doppler image saved in Step 3.4.6, analyze the venous flow line seen below the baseline as continuous, monophasic or biphasic. Register the findings in the CRF.\nUsing the image saved in Step 3.4.6, click the Measure button and use the trackball to select the Abdominal-Renal-PS/ED/RI options on the right-side menu.\nPlace the cursor on the peak and on the lowest point of the pulsatile flow wave in the positive half of the y axis.\nNOTE: The G6 machine can calculate the Doppler renal resistive index (RRI) automatically if a continuous pulsatile flow wave is stored, using the formula: RRI = (peak systolic velocity — end diastolic velocity)/peak systolic velocity. Save the image with the measurement from the ultrasound machine on the screen.",
    "Using the image saved in Step 3.4.6 or 3.4.7, click the Caliper button and place the cursor, first, over the peak maximum flow velocity, and then over the maximal flow velocity at nadir (i.e., end diastolic)19. Save the image after measurement.\nNOTE: The venous impedance index (VII) is calculated from: VII = (peak systolic velocity — end diastolic velocity) / peak systolic velocity20,21. The VII is not registered in case of monophasic flow, as then only one peak is visible and no diastolic and systolic phases are distinguishable.\n6. Data Registration, Storage, and Validation of Ultrasound Images\nNOTE: As Figure 1 shows, data registration is done after each clinical examination. Below, the procedure of entering the data obtained from the measurements, clinical examination, and biochemical information (Table 2) retrieved from the electronic health record into the study subject's anonymized online file is described.\nAccess the online secured patient management system and open the dossier of the recently included patient. Register the blood gas analysis values, general serum variables, serum renal variables, and 24 h urine analysis. The list of all the variables that are obtained and instructions to do so are presented in Table 2.\nValidate the cardiac CCUS images.\n\tNOTE: This validation is done by independent experts of a Cardiovascular Imaging Core Laboratory in accordance with EACVI guidelines22. The quality of the images obtained by the student-researchers is assessed and the measurements performed are repeated to ensure the required quality of dimensional measurements and tracings of velocity profiles.\n\t\nPerform the LVOT measurements at end-diastole, as seen on the ECG signal, just beneath the aortic valve.\nTrace the PW signal taken from the LVOT in an AP5CH view to obtain the left ventricular stroke volume and left ventricular CO.",
    "Validate all images and measurements of the IVC and kidneys. This should be performed by an independent experienced abdominal radiologist. Should there be issues with obtaining the desired images during clinical examination, the independent abdominal radiologist can be called to perform the CCUS, in which case no further validation takes place.\n7. Patient Follow-up\nRegistering informed consent\nIf patient or family consent is obtained during any of the clinical examinations or after the clinical examinations protocol is finished but the patient is still admitted to the hospital, register this in the patient data management system and upload the hand-signed consent form.\nIf consent was denied, register this in the patient data management system along with the reason for not obtaining consent, and notify the study coordinator, who will delete all patient data.\nMortality data\nFor patients who die during admission, register mortality directly from the electronic patient record and the associated cause of death.\nFor patients without in-hospital mortality, obtain mortality data from the municipal registry in the Netherlands, which is updated every 90 days."
