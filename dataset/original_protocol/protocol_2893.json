    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nSECM lysis\nTiming: 2–3 h\nIn this step, cfDNAs of SECM are released after degradation of proteins and other components.\nMeasure the volume of each SECM sample with a micropipette and add nuclease-free water to reach a total volume of 16.6 μL. If the original volume of the sample is more than 16.6 μL, use only 16.6 μL.\nNote: As the volumes of the collected SECM samples are generally more than 5 μL with variation, we have adapted the lysis step of the single-cell PBAT protocol for SECM by increasing the total volume of the lysis reaction from 5 μL to 20 μL.\nCritical: The volume of the SECM sample should be accurately measured.\nAdd the lysis buffer (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) to each SECM sample from step 1 to make a final lysis reaction volume of 20 μL.\nMix well by vortexing and spinning down for a few seconds.\nImmediately place the tube in a heating block, incubating for 1 h at 50°C and then 30 min at 75°C.\nCentrifuge at 9,000 g for 1 min and immediately place the tube on ice.\nPause point: Lysed SECM samples can be stored at −80°C for up to six months.\nBisulfite conversion and purification\nTiming: 5–7 h\nIn this step, unmethylated Cs are changed to Us while methylated Cs (most in the CpG context) are preserved, and thus the information on DNA methylation is provided at single base resolution.\nDissolve the CT Conversion Reagent by shaking it in a Thermomixer at 37°C until completely clear.\nCritical: The CT Conversion Reagent should be stored away from light and fully dissolved when used. The temperature can be increased to 42°C to ensure no precipitation.",
    "Add 130 μL prepared CT conversion reagent to each 20 μL SECM lysate. Mix by vortexing. Incubate at 98°C for 8 min, 64°C for 3.5 h for bisulfite conversion of the SECM cfDNA, and then hold at 4°C.\nPause point: The bisulfite-converted SECM cfDNA can be stored at −20°C for up to 3 days or 4°C for 1 day.\nTroubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nPurify the bisulfite-converted SECM cfDNA using the Zymo EZ-96 DNA Methylation-Direct™ MagPrep kit.\nAdd 10 μL of MagBinding Beads and 600 μL of M-Binding Buffer to 1.5 mL DNA LoBind Tubes.\nAdd the 150 μL bisulfite-converted SECM cfDNA from step 5 to the MagBinding Beads and M-Binding Buffer, vortexing fully for 30 s.\nIncubate the mixture at 20°C–25°C for 5 min to bind the DNA to the beads.\nPlace the tubes on a magnetic stand until the solution clears, and then remove and discard the supernatant by pipetting.\nRemove the tubes from the magnetic stand and add 400 μL M-Wash Buffer. Mix the beads by vortexing.\nPlace the tube on the magnetic stand until the solution clears, and then remove the supernatant by pipetting and discard the supernatant.\nRemove the tubes from the magnetic stand and add 200 μL of M-Desulfonation Buffer, and mix thoroughly by vortexing for 30 s.\nLet tubes stand at 20°C–25°C for 15 min. Then place the tubes on the magnetic stand until the solution clears, and then discard the supernatant by pipetting.\nRemove the tubes from the magnetic stand and add 400 μL of M-Wash Buffer to the beads.\nPlace the tubes on the magnetic stand until the solution clears, and then discard the supernatant by pipetting. Repeat this step once.\nTransfer the tubes to the heating block and dry the beads for 20 min at 55°C.",
    "Resuspend the beads with 21.5 μL of M-Elution Buffer, and heat the elution at 55°C for 2 min to fully elute the DNA.\nPlace the tubes on the magnetic stand until the solution clears, and then remove and transfer 19.5 μL supernatant to a clean PCR tube.\nNote: As the MagBinding Beads precipitate very easily, keep the solution well mixed throughout the process. One can use the preamplification priming mixture for dissolving the DNA, as described by Clark et al.18[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib18]\nPause point: Purified bisulfite-converted DNA can be stored at −20°C for no more than two weeks.\nPreamplification by random priming\nTiming: 4 h\nIn this step, four rounds of DNA stands (the first strands) complementary to the bisulfite-converted DNA are synthesized using Klenow DNA polymerase and random primers with the adapter I being tagged.\nPrepare the preamplification priming mixture as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2606_3.csv\nMix well by gently pipetting up and down. Incubate the mixture on a heating block at 65°C for 3 min. And then immediately transfer the PCR tubes on ice.\nNote: After adding 1 μL of Klenow DNA polymerase in step 9, the total volume will reach 25 μL.\nCritical: The tubes need to be sufficiently cooled to avoid reduction of the activity of the Klenow DNA polymerase.\nAdd 1 μL of Klenow DNA polymerase (3′-5′ exo-, 50 U/μL, from TIANGEN or New England Biolabs) to the mixture. Mix well by gently pipetting up and down 15 times. Centrifuge at 300 g for 10 s at 20°C–25°C and then place the tubes on a pre-cooled (4°C) thermocycler.\nIncubate the tubes in the thermocycler for one round of preamplification as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2606_4.csv\nHeat the mixture to 95°C for 1 min in a thermocycler and then immediately cool it at 4°C.",
    "Critical: The tubes need to be sufficiently cooled to avoid reduction of the activity of the Klenow DNA polymerase.\nAdd the following freshly prepared solution for the next round of preamplification:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2606_5.csv\nNote: The dNTPs mixture of 2.5 nM is diluted from the dNTPs mixture of 10 mM, and the P5-N9-oligo1 of 25 pΜ is diluted from the P5-N9-oligo1 of 10 μΜ, both with 1× Blue Buffer.\nMix well by gently pipetting up and down. Incubate the tubes in the thermocycler as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2606_6.csv\nRepeat steps 11–13 for additional two times, making four rounds of preamplification in total.\nAfter the PCR cycles, centrifuge the tubes at 500 g for 1 min. Next, purify the First-strand random priming product using 0.8× AMPure XP beads.\nAdd 26 μL of AMPure XP Beads to the PCR Tube.\nGently shake the PCR tube until a homogeneous solution is seen.\nIncubate the PCR tubes for 10 min at 20°C–25°C for maximum recovery.\nPlace PCR tubes on the magnetic stand at 20°C–25°C for 5 min until the solution becomes clear.\nRemove and discard the supernatant carefully.\nAdd 200 mL of 70% ethanol to each tube and pipet up and down 10 times gently, then remove the supernatant.\nRepeat step f.\nRemove the tube from the magnetic stand and place it at 20°C–25°C until the ethanol is evaporated.\nNote: In this step, XP beads become light brown, which means they are in a dry state.\nAdd 21.5 μL nuclease-free water, and mix by vortexing for 30 s.\nIncubate at 20°C–25°C for 2 min and then place the PCR tube again in the magnetic stand until the solution becomes clear.\nTransfer 19.5 μL of the supernatant to the next step.\nNote: XP beads need to be placed at 20°C–25°C for 30 min before use.\nTagging adapter II",
    "Timing: 3 h\nIn this step, the second DNA strand complementary to the first DNA strand is synthesized using Klenow DNA polymerase and random primers with the adapter II being tagged.\nPrepare the adapter II tagging mixture on ice as follows:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2606_7.csv\nNote: After adding 1 μL of Klenow DNA polymerase in step 18, the total volume will reach 25 μL.\nHeat the mixture at 95°C for 3 min in a PCR thermocycler, then immediately place the PCR tubes on ice.\nAdd 1 μL of Klenow DNA polymerase (3′–5′ exo-, 50 U/μL) to the mixture.

    "Note: The cfDNA from the SECM of the ICSI-generated blastula has three main cellular components: the blastula, the cumulus cell, and the polar body. We have identified 769 cumulus-specific differentially methylated regions (C-DMRs) and 548 oocyte/polar body-specific DMRs (O-DMRs).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] The average methylation levels of the C-DMRs of the blastula, the cumulus cell and the oocyte/polar body are 4%, 92% and 3%, respectively. The average methylation levels of the O-DMRs of the blastula, the cumulus cell, and the oocyte/polar body are 22%, 19% and 82%, respectively. The mathematical relationship between the methylation levels of each DMRs (DMRi, referring to C-DMRs or O-DMRs) in the SECM cfDNA and the proportional contribution of each component (component k, referring to the blastula, the cumulus cell, and the polar body) can be expressed by the formula MMi = ΣMCik × Pk × aik, in which MMi represents the methylation levels of DMRi in the SECM cfDNA, MCik represents the average methylation levels of DMRi in component k, Pk represents the proportional contribution of component k to the SECM cfDNA, and aik represents PCR amplification efficiency of DMRi in component k (Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1]). Therefore, there are three unknown Pk (P for the blastula, the cumulus cell and the polar body) in three formulas (the formulas for C-DMRs and O-DMRs, as well as the formula that the sum of three Pk is equal to 100%). By solving the three-variable linear equation, we can get the values for three Pk. The parameters of MCik and aik are listed in Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1].\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2606_11.csv\nNote: “MC”: the average methylation level of DMR i in component k. “a”: correction factor for the potential bias of PCR amplification toward the unmethylated allele.19[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]\nCalculate the methylation level of C-DMRs for the SECM cfDNA.",
