    "1. Biofilm Cultivation\nPreparation of Bacterial Strains\n\t\n1 day prior to biofilm cultivation, prepare planktonic bacterial cultures by inoculating 2 ml of appropriate growth medium from frozen bacterial culture. Use Luria-Broth medium (10 g L-1 NaCl, 10 g L-1 yeast extract, and 10 g L-1 tryptone) for mucoid P. aeruginosa and its Δpel and Δpsl defective mutants. Incubate overnight at 37 °C and 200 rpm shaking conditions. Dilute overnight cultures to an OD600 of 0.40 using a spectrophotometer.\nAssemble flow cell setup, which has been described previously 14, preferably on a mobile station or trolley that can be brought into the microscope room for imaging the flow cell without disassembly.\nPrepare sterile growth medium in 2 L or 5 L bottles for each flow cell. Use minimal medium M9 (48 mM Na2HPO4, 22 mM KH2PO4, 19 mM NH4Cl, 9 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgSO4, and 0.1 mM CaCl2) supplemented with 0.04% glucose (wt/vol) and 0.2%(wt/vol) casamino acids) for P. aeruginosa flow cell biofilms.\nAliquot fluorescent microspheres into microcentrifuge tubes and spin down in sterile H2O for 5 min in centrifuge at 9,391.2 g. Remove supernatant and resuspend in 1 ml growth medium to remove sodium azide (disinfectant) prior to adding to growth medium in 2 L or 5 L medium bottles.\n\t\tNOTE: Different sizes of microspheres come in different concentrations and should be diluted accordingly to instructions. For example, disperse 120 µl of 1.0 µm diameter microspheres, 15 µl of 0.5 µm diameter microspheres and 0.96 µl of 0.2 µm diameter microspheres into 2 L of growth medium to give 2.18 × 106 microspheres ml-1 for each particle size.",
    "Attach medium bottle to upstream of flow cell and allow growth medium to flow through entire setup. Stop flow and inject diluted overnight cultures into flow cell chambers. Allow bacteria to attach to the coverslip substratum for 1 hr before continuing flow of growth medium at a flow rate of approximately 5.5 x 10-3 m sec-1,or 8 rpm with a peristaltic pump.\n\t\tNOTE: Biofilms are usually grown at room temperature (25 °C) for 3-7 days.\nAlternatively, for static culture setup, dilute overnight cultures 100 fold in microcentrifuge tubes by adding 10 µl of overnight culture to 1 ml growth medium with particles. Increase the particle concentration in the growth medium for static culture by approximately 500-fold compared to that used for flow biofilms (e.g. wash and resuspend 600 µl of 1.0 µm diameter spheres in 10 ml of growth medium) as flow cell biofilms are constantly replenished with particles but static cultures are not.\n\t\t\nAdd 200 µl of diluted overnight culture with particles to the chambers of 8 well slides. Incubate at 37 °C under static conditions. Biofilms are usually grown for 1 day. Replace spent growth medium daily with fresh growth medium with particles if biofilm is grown for more than 1 day.\n2. Microscopy\nOn day 3 and 5, switch off flow from peristaltic pump and bring flow cell setup into the microscopy room. Clamp tubing near the entrance and exit of the flow cell chambers to prevent drift (a systematic error cause by changes in the environment) from flow. Place the flow cell onto the microscope stage of an upright microscope.\n\tNOTE: Use an inverted microscope for imaging of microwells.",
    "Use fluorescent microscopy with 40X oil objective to take videos of microsphere motion embedded in the biofilm at various locations (microcolonies and flat undifferentiated layers) and in different days (day 3 and 5) for temporal and spatial investigations. Take shorter videos with higher frame rate to investigate events occurring within short time scales (e.g. 1.5-3 min videos at frame rate of 25-50 frames per second for fast dynamics), and longer videos with lower frame rate to investigate events over longer time scales (e.g. 15-30 min videos at frame rate of 2.5-5 frames/sec for slower dynamics).\n\tNOTE: A video typically contains 5-10 particles, and is typically of 1.0-2.5 GB in file size. Larger microcolonies may hold more particles. Take 5-10 videos for each category (e.g. 5-10 videos of different microcolonies and of different locations in flat undifferentiated layers). The biofilm has a heterogeneous architecture that may consist of microcolonies, channels, voids and flat undifferentiated layers.\nSave videos in appropriate format that can be read by Fiji/ImageJ (e.g. czi, tif).\nCheck videos for drift by scrolling through finished video and observing that the particles do not move in the same direction simultaneously. Drift can be caused by z-stage motion, currents in the flow cell, imbalance of anti-vibration table, air pressure or temperature changes. Correct minor drifting using post-processing techniques usually provided with microscope software. Discard any videos wherein drift cannot be corrected. Record the following parameters, which are required during Particle Tracking Analysis: Resolution (px/um), Number of Frames, Duration.\nRemove flow cell from microscope stage and restart peristaltic pump to continue cultivating the biofilm.\n3. Particle Tracking Analysis\nObtain particle trajectories by using the plug-in TrackMate in open source software (ImageJ). Download Fiji at  http://fiji.sc/Fiji[href=http://fiji.sc/Fiji]. Open the video with Fiji and under the Plugins menu, select Tracking and TrackMate.",
    "Check or adjust settings in the window suggesting initial calibration settings to match the video parameters as recorded in step 2.4.\nDetect particles in TrackMate using ImageJ.\n\t\nSelect 'LoG detector', input particle diameter and threshold value (e.g. 1,000). Scroll through the video whilst clicking on 'Preview' button to check that the purple circles follow the particles throughout the video. Adjust the diameter and threshold values as necessary: increase the threshold value if purple circles appear in the empty space. Reduce the threshold value if not enough particles are detected. Click the next button to complete detection the particles.\nClick the next button when presented with the option to add or remove particles detected in 'Initial thresholding', 'Select a view' and 'Select a filter' windows to continue without adjustment if initial particle detection was satisfactory.\nSelect 'Simple LAP tracker' in the option bar of 'Select a tracker method' window as particles rarely move out of focus in the biofilm and are easily tracked. Use the suggested or low linking and gap-closing max distance values, and click next.\nCheck that particle tracking is satisfactory by scrolling through the video to see that particles follow the tracks drawn by TrackMate, and that there are no unwanted or missing tracks. Skip the various filtering steps. Go to the final window 'Select an action'. Select 'Export tracks to xml file' from the drop down menu and click 'Execute'. Choose a folder to save the tracks.\n\t\tNOTE: There are various programs available in the public domain for the analysis of particle trajectories and use of microrheology. msdanalyzer and TrackArt are examples of particle tracking analysis programs that run in the Matlab environment.",
    "Prepare Matlab to import the particle trajectories in the xml files by selecting in the menu of Matlab File>Set Path... and add the scripts folder available with the Fiji package.\nTo analyze the particle trajectories with msdanalyzer, download the link to the zip file or the tar.gz file at http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/40692-mean-square-displacement-analysis-of-particles-trajectories[href=http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/40692-mean-square-displacement-analysis-of-particles-trajectories].\n\t\nExtract the @msdanalyzer folder15 and drop it in a folder that belongs to the Matlab path (e.g. C:\\Documents and Settings\\<Username>\\My Documents\\Matlab). Start Matlab and initiate the analyzer by typing:\n\t\tma = msdanalyzer(2, 'um', 'sec')\n\t\twhere um and sec are the physical space and time units in the video.\n\t\t\nImport the particle trajectories by typing:\n\t\t\t[tracks, md] = importTrackMateTracks('FileName.xml', 'clipZ', 'scaleT')\n\t\t\tma = ma.addAll(tracks);\n\t\t\twhere 'clipZ' removes the z dimension for a 2D video, and 'scaleT'.\nPlot the trajectories onto graph using:\n\t\t\tma.plotTracks;\n\t\t\tma.labelPlotTracks;\nCompute the MSDs of the particles using:\n\t\t\tma = ma.computeMSD;\n\t\t\tma.msd\nPlot the MSDs of each particle:\n\t\t\tfigure\n\t\t\tma.plotMSD\nCombine particle trajectories from other videos of the same categery (e.g. particles embedded in wild-type microcolonies at day 3) by repeating 3.5.1.1 to 3.5.1.4).\nPlot the ensemble mean or the average over all curves:\n\t\t\tma.plotMeanMSD\n\t\t\tChange the y- and x-axis from linear to logarithmic scale. At long lag times, the MSD curves become noisy due to insufficient statistics at longer timescales. The MSD curves may also rise steeply due to dynamic error. These regions of the curve can be removed by using the brush tool to select the end of the curve and selecting 'Brushing' > 'Remove Unbrushed' in the Tools menu.",
    "Download Ezyfit at http://www.fast.u-psud.fr/ezyfit/[href=http://www.fast.u-psud.fr/ezyfit/] and add Ezyfit to a folder belonging to the Matlab path (e.g. C:\\Documents and Settings\\<Username>\\My Documents\\Matlab). Install the Ezyfit menu by typing in Matlab workspace efmenu install. Restart MATLAB with Ezyfit menu in the figure window. Fit the MSD curves to the power law by selecting in the Ezyfit menu 'Show Fit' > 'Power' > 'a*x^n' were n is the estimated diffusive exponent α.\n\t\tNOTE: msdanalyzer requires the Curve Fitting Toolbox in Matlab for fitting of MSD curves. Ezyfit is an alternative and free software that can perform curve fitting.\nClear current particle trajectories and MSDs to calculate new particle MSDs at other locations or time:\n\t\tclear\nAfter calculation of various mean MSD curves of particles in medium (control), and microcolonies and undifferentiated areas of various strains, copy and paste the curves into one graph for comparison. Sample stiffness and crosslinking increase with lower MSD values. Flat curves have lower α and sample is more elastic than steeper curves with higher α.\nSelect the curve and go to \"Tools\" to look at the data statistics, such as the median and range. The MSD of the bead is proportional to the creep compliance, J(t) of the material in which the bead is embedded according to the relation,\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/53093/53093eq1.jpg\n\t\twhere J = creep compliance, d = particle diameter, kB = Boltzman constant, T = temperature and t = time.\nSubscription Required.
