    "1. Fly preparation for ovary dissections\nPut 10-15 Drosophila melanogaster female flies (1-2 days old) of the desired genotype in a narrow vial containing ~8 mL of Drosophila fly medium sprinkled with a small amount of granulated baker's yeast 2-3 days prior to dissection at 25 °C. Adding a few males to the vial can boost egg chamber yield. However, ensure that the total number of flies does not exceed 20 as this can negatively affect ovary development.\n\t​NOTE: Description of Drosophila males and females, and useful tips and advice for scientists without prior Drosophila experience can be found in the cited articles34,52. Adding yeast will stimulate egg production and generate ovaries with different stages represented. Moreover, it will also fatten the ovaries and make them easier to excise. Wet yeast can also be used instead of granulated yeast, however, for weaker stocks, the flies may get stuck and die.\n2. Ovary dissection and fixation\nNOTE: For additional resources on ovary dissection and staining, readers are directed to the cited protocols53,54,55.\nOn the day of dissection, prepare fresh fixation solution with a final concentration of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) by diluting the PFA stock solution in 1x phosphate buffer saline (PBS).\nAnesthetize the flies using CO2 and place them on a fly pad. Keep the flies anesthetized until dissection. Consider flies properly anesthetized once their movements have ceased, which usually takes 10-20 s.\n\tNOTE: Although using CO2 is recommended as a safer and faster option, flies can be anesthetized using ice.\nPlace a glass concave slide or staining dish with shallow depression wells under a dissecting microscope and fill the wells with 1x PBS.",
    "Grasp a female fly at the lower thorax using a pair of forceps. Ensure the sex of the flies by the absence of male genitalia at the posterior end of the abdomen and the absence of sex combs on their forelegs as a secondary characteristic52. Dissect flies individually using another pair of forceps (step 2.5) while submerging them into wells filled with 1x PBS under the dissecting microscope (20x magnification is recommended).\nWhile looking through the dissecting microscope, use another pair of forceps to tug at the posterior part of the fly abdomen, making the internal organs (e.g., ovaries, gut) visible.\nGently squeeze the anterior part of the fly abdomen (as with a tube of toothpaste) to force the ovaries out of the abdomen. This method should keep the ovaries intact. Detach and carefully remove other organs and fly debris.\nUsing forceps or dissecting needles, separate the ovarioles of the ovary while keeping the overall ovary structure intact. The purpose of this step is to break the muscle sheath covering the ovaries and allow for a more efficient and homogenous staining.\nQuickly transfer the ovaries to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube containing 1x PBS and keep the tube on ice until all the flies are dissected. Do not keep the tube on ice if microtubules or microfilaments (or vesicles trafficked by these cytoskeletal components) are to be visualized as this can cause depolymerization.",
    "Once all the ovaries are dissected and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube, allow them to sink to the bottom of the tube and remove all but ~50 µL of the PBS. Add 1 mL of 4% PFA and place on a nutating platform rocker for 15 min. Importantly, check whether the ovaries are moving back and forth in the fixation solution to allow for proper fixation as incomplete fixation could lead to staining and imaging issues.\n\tNOTE: The speed of the nutator is not crucial. While some nutators have a speed control, others come with a preset speed. The preset speed is sufficient, and if adjustable, set to 40-50 rpm.\nRemove the fixation solution (as in step 2.9), and then perform two quick washes with 1 mL of 1x PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X 100 (1x PBST), by gently inverting the microfuge tubes 5-6 times. Then, proceed with four 10-15 min washes (long wash) with 1 mL of 1x PBST (40-60 min total).\n\tNOTE: It is recommended to use 1x PBS + 0.1% Triton-X 100 for washes as increasing the percentage of detergent could result in GFP denaturation, leading to decreased fluorescence and detection of GFP-tagged BM proteins.\nFor dye staining, e.g., DNA and F-actin staining, proceed to step 3. For immunostaining, proceed to step 4. The ovaries can be stored in 1x PBST at 4 °C for up to 24 h before proceeding.\n3. Standard DNA/F-Actin staining\nAfter fixation and washing, remove PBST. Add 500 µL of DNA and F-Actin staining solution. To prepare the DNA/F-Actin solution, mix Hoechst (DNA stain; 1:1000 dilution of 1 mg/mL stock solution) and fluorophore-tagged phalloidin (F-actin stain; 1:500 dilution for Alexa Fluor 546 or 1:100 dilution for Alexa Fluor 647, each of 66 µM stock solution) in 500 µL of PBST.",
    "Cover the tubes with aluminum foil to keep the ovaries and dyes in the dark to maintain the fluorescence for efficient imaging and incubate on a nutating platform rocker for 15 min.\nAfter incubation, remove the DNA/F-Actin solution (as in step 2.9). Perform two quick washes and three long (10-15 min) washes in 1x PBST as described in step 2.10. Proceed to mounting as described in step 5.\n4. Fluorescence immunostaining\nNOTE: This is a standard immunostaining protocol for fluorescent imaging and is compatible with most primary antibodies.\nBlocking and primary antibody immunostaining (Day 1)\n\t\nAfter fixation and washing, remove PBST as described in step 2.9. Add 1 mL of blocking solution (PBS + 5% BSA) and block the ovaries on a nutating platform rocker for 1 h minimum.\n\t\tNOTE: In addition to BSA, fetal bovine serum (FBS) or normal goat serum (NGS) can be added to the blocking solution. Alternatively, the ovaries can be blocked overnight on a nutating platform rocker at 4 °C.\nRemove blocking solution as in step 2.9 and add 300 µL of primary antibody solution containing primary antibodies diluted at their appropriate concentrations (specific to the antibody used) in the blocking solution. Incubate overnight on a nutating platform rocker at 4 °C. The next day, remove the primary antibody solution and proceed to secondary antibody immunostaining.\n\t\tNOTE: Some primary antibodies can be saved and reused. In some instances, reused primary antibodies can reduce background staining, resulting in better imaging. However, reuse should be tested for each antibody to ensure efficiency.\nSecondary antibody immunostaining (Day 2)\n\t\nAfter removing the primary antibody solution, perform two quick washes and four long (10-15 min) washes as in step 2.10. Carefully done repetitive washes using fresh 1x PBST will decrease non-specific background and lead to optimal imaging.",
    "Remove PBST as in step 2.9 and add 500 µL of secondary antibody solution containing fluorescent secondary antibodies that will detect the primary antibodies used. Protect the tube from light by covering it in aluminum foil from this point on for optimal conservation of fluorescence, which is critical for image acquisition and analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: The secondary antibody solution should contain secondary antibodies conjugated with fluorophores that do not overlap with endogenously tagged proteins. For example, if using GFP-tagged proteins, the use of Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies at red or far-red wavelengths is recommended (e.g., 546, 568, or 647 nm). Fluorescent dyes, such as Hoechst and Alexa Fluor 546 or 647 conjugated phalloidin, can be added to the secondary solution. These stains could be helpful to mark the overall cell structure (i.e., nuclei and F-Actin). Refer to step 3.1 for the concentrations.\nIncubate the ovaries in the secondary antibody solution on a nutating platform rocker for 2 h at room temperature. Perform two quick washes and four long (10-15 min) washes in 1x PBST as in step 2.10. Proceed to mounting as in step 5.\n5. Mounting of stained ovaries\nNOTE: This method works very well if the ovaries are well-developed and abundant. Careful mounting of the ovaries on the slide is critical for optimal imaging.\nAfter the last wash, use a p1000 pipette to gently pipet the ovaries up and down in the tube to separate the egg chambers. Allow the egg chambers to sink to the bottom by keeping the tube in an upright position for 5-10 min. Careful separation of individual egg chambers is critical to achieve optimal image acquisition.",
    "Remove PBST using a Pasteur pipet, leaving ~50 µL. Remove as much of the remaining PBST as possible using a p200 pipette. Add two drops of mounting medium, enough to spread evenly on a 22 mm x 22 mm coverslip. Ovaries can be stored in mounting medium in microcentrifuge tubes at 4 °C for up to 1 month prior to mounting.\n\tNOTE: Several different mounting media are available commercially; using hard-setting mountants, such as Aqua-Poly/Mount or ProLong Glass Antifade Mountant, is recommended to achieve optimal imaging conditions. The use of glycerol as a mounting medium is discouraged since it can lead to poor imaging conditions (e.g., fluorophore instability). For mounting media that do not polymerize, seal the coverslip using a coverslip sealant/nail polish to secure it in place.\nLabel a glass slide and wipe it with soft, dust free paper to remove dust and fingerprints. Cut off the end of a p200 pipette tip to allow easy transfer of the viscous mounting medium to the slide from the microcentrifuge tube. Next, slowly transfer all the egg chambers in the mounting medium to the glass slide, ensuring not to create bubbles.\nUnder a dissecting microscope, gently spread out the mounting medium and separated egg chambers using a new p200 tip or forceps to cover an area approximately the size of the coverslip.\nUsing forceps, carefully place the coverslip (cleaned with dust-free paper) on the egg chambers at an angle to avoid bubbles.\nStore the slide at room temperature on a flat surface in the dark for 2 days to polymerize. Once the mounting media has cured, the slide can be stored at 4 °C in the dark for a few weeks for imaging.",
    "NOTE: It is important for hard setting mounting medium to polymerize before imaging. If the medium has not yet polymerized, the ovaries will float under the coverslip, affecting image acquisition. Moreover, the optimal reflective index of mounting media is only achieved after it completely sets (see the manufacturer's information for details).\nAlternative mounting method: This method is recommended to reduce tissue loss if ovaries are not abundant. In this method (described below), separate the ovarioles and the egg chambers on the slide while mounting, instead of separating them in a microcentrifuge tube by pipetting as described in step 5.1.\n\t\nAfter the last wash, remove all but ~100 µL of the wash solution. Using a Pasteur pipette or p1000 pipette, transfer the intact ovaries in PBS to the slide. Using a p200 pipette, carefully remove as much PBST from the slide as possible. Use a dust-free paper to wipe away the PBST, if needed. Do not touch the ovaries.\nAdd two drops of mounting media. Carefully separate the ovarioles and egg chambers using forceps or dissecting needles. Remove and discard extraneous tissue, and then spread out the egg chambers and ovarioles in the mounting medium. Proceed to steps 5.5-5.6.\n6. Confocal image acquisition\nNOTE: This section provides key parameters to achieve optimal image acquisition using any confocal microscope (Figure 2).\nSet up the microscope and locate the sample as described below.\n\t\nBefore imaging, it is crucial to locate the region of interest (ROI) using the eyepiece of the fluorescence microscope. Use a low magnification objective (20x) or the objective to be used for image acquisition (i.e., 40x or 63x). Select an egg chamber to image.\n\t\tNOTE: For image acquisition, using high magnification objectives such as 40x or 63x is recommended (see 6.2.1).",
    "Once the ROI is selected, proceed to image acquisition; proceed to step 6.2 for confocal imaging, and step 7 for super-resolution imaging.\nSelect the key parameters for optimal image acquisition as described below (examples of key parameters for the representative images are given in Table 1).\n\t\nSelecting an objective: For confocal image acquisition of the intracellular trafficking and secretion of BM proteins in the FE, use a 40x or 63x objective.\n\t\tNOTE: To achieve the best resolution possible, the use of Plan-Apochromat objectives, with high numerical aperture (NA) that provide the highest achromatic correction, is highly recommended.\nSelecting lasers for each channel/track: For GFP, use laser 488 nm; for DAPI or Hoechst, use laser 405 nm; for Alexa Fluor 546 or 568, use laser 561 nm; and for Alexa Fluor 647, use laser 640 nm.\n\t\tNOTE: Each laser selection will result in a different channel/track formation. Here, the term channel refers to the image formed by the recorded intensity distribution for excited fluorophores for the selected ROI at the specific wavelength of each channel.\nPinhole setting: To reduce out-of-focus light during image acquisition, set the pinhole for each channel to 1 AU.\nLaser intensity and detector gain settings: To fine tune the image sensitivity, use both the detector master gain and laser power. To properly set the image sensitivity, a range indicator is recommended. Set both the master gain and laser power to have a proper sensitivity where the structures of interest (e.g., BM-containing vesicles) are clearly visible while avoiding detector saturation.",
    "NOTE: To avoid photobleaching, use the minimal laser power necessary. It is recommended to increase the detector gain first while using the lowest laser power possible. If an increase of the detector gain cannot achieve the desired intensity, then increase the laser power. Laser power intensity between 0.5%-1.2% is recommended.\nFrame size: it is recommended to use the optimal image size determined by the acquisition software. For most applications, use a maximal resolution of 1024 x 1024. Higher resolution will significantly increase the acquisition time.\nScan speed: Use a scan speed between 6-9, which is safe for most samples. If the sample is noisy, use a slower scan speed to improve signal-to-noise ratios. However, low scan speeds increase photobleaching and acquisition time.\nMean intensity averaging: To improve image quality, use mean intensity averaging via successive scans with identical settings. For most cases, use an averaging of two to improve signal-to-noise ratios without photobleaching the sample.\nZoom: Adjust the scan area using the zoom function. Use a zoom between 2x-4x with both 40x and 63x objectives as the most effective value to clearly visualize BM-containing vesicles in the FE. Carefully select the minimal ROI to reduce the acquisition time.\nTo acquire a z-stack using Zeiss Zen software, use the following Z-sectioning parameters and set them as described below.\n\tNOTE: Vesicles and other intracellular structures containing BM proteins are 3-dimensional (3D) structures. Acquiring a z-stack through the FE will significantly improve image quality and resolution. Usually, a range spanning the thickness/depth of the tissue is sufficient to efficiently visualize intracellular localization. For optimal 3D reconstruction, using the optimal interval that is determined by the software is recommended. For 40x and 63x objectives, avoid intervals higher than 0.5 µm between each z-section to allow for optimal 3D reconstruction.",
    "Click on the z-Stack checkbox in the main area under the Acquisition tab. Select the All Tracks Per Slice scanning mode for the z-stack. This will result in a change in channel tracks for each z-position slice.\nSelect the desired channel to observe the specimen and click on Live to start a live scan. Use of the channel needed to detect the GFP-tagged BM protein is recommended.\nSet a range for the z-stack as described. Using the fine adjustment knob on the microscope, find the z-location for one end of the specimen, and click on Set First. Similarly, find the z-location for the other end of the specimen and click on Set Last.\nFor each location in the z-stack, click on each channel separately with the range indicator selected, and adjust the intensity of the laser and the master gain as needed, as described in step 6.2.4.\nSet the interval for the z-stack to assign the step size as recommended in the NOTE below step 6.3. Click on Start Experiment to begin z-stack acquisition.\n7. Super-resolution image acquisition\nSelect an Airyscan compatible objective. To visualize the intracellular localization of BM protein, use of a 63x oil objective is optimal (Figure 3). Set the objective to 63x and gently place a drop of immersion oil on its lens. Position the slide on the objective with coverslip facing the objective to locate the specimen.\nSelect a configuration with appropriate settings for the fluorophore to image as described below.\n\t\nClick on the Smart Setup button in the Acquisition tab to configure a new experiment. Select Airyscan (super-resolution); when this is selected, a further selection between Resolution (Airyscan SR), SNR/sensitivity (Airyscan Confocal), and Speed (Multiplex SR-2Y) will be required. For fixed tissue, select Resolution as that will result in the best acquisition.",
    "Click on + in the Configure Your Experiment box to add tracks/channels. Select the tracks for specific dyes from the Dye Database. For a multi-channel experiment, add each track as needed by selecting the appropriate dyes.\nAfter all the tracks have been added, select one of the experiment proposals provided by the software. For this experiment, use Best Signal, as although the speed will be a little slower compared to the Smartest (Line) proposal, it will create the best hardware settings for each dye, resulting in maximum signal gain and minimal emission crosstalk. Once the experiment has been set and loaded, it will appear in the Imaging Setup window in the Acquisition tab.\nOnce a smart setup is selected, the range of wavelengths for the detector GaAsP-PMT will automatically be selected. Adjust the range by moving the scroll bar at the bottom to increase or decrease the range or completely move the range to another region as required. Use this to make sure that the ranges of two different channels do not overlap to avoid crosstalk. Save the configuration to reuse in the future.\nOnce the configuration is set, proceed to adjust the zoom and scan area as in step 6.2.8. Optimize the scan area to focus on the region of interest to reduce scan time and storage space. Proceed to acquiring images.\nFor each individual channel, select a track under Channel and click on Live. Adjust the master gain and laser power using the range indicator tool as described in step 6.2.4 and follow all the guidelines described to avoid saturated pixels. Confirm that the hexagonal detector view is centered and aligned by clicking on the Airyscan Detector View button. In most cases, the hexagonal detector view is automatically centered and aligned. Repeat for additional channels.",
    "In the Acquisition mode toggle window, under Image Size, click on SR (super-resolution-limited pixel count) to maximize the capabilities of the detector. This will adjust the frame size automatically.\nKeep the averaging to None as it is usually not necessary, and this will decrease the scan time. In some cases, an averaging of 2x may improve the signal-to-noise ratio.\nCollect raw data with 8-bit data depths. Click on Snap to acquire an image. To acquire a z-stack, follow step 6.3.\nPerform image processing as described below. This will produce a 16-bit image.\n\t\nOnce the image or z-stack is obtained, click on the Processing > Method and select Airyscan Processing.\nPerform auto filter to start with and perform further manual processing by changing the SR value to obtain the best results for the sample. Once the optimal SR value has been determined, click on Apply to generate a processed image. In the case of z-stack images, process either as one z-slice (Current Image [2D]) or as the whole z-stack by clicking on the 3D Processing box.\n8. Image processing and data analysis (orthogonal projection, 3D reconstruction and intensity profile)\nNOTE: For this method, the steps used to generate orthogonal projections, 3D reconstructions, and intensity profiles are described for the Zen software (see Table of Materials). Similar data analyses may also be performed with ImageJ software56.\nPerform orthogonal projection as described below (Figure 4).\n\t\nOnce a z-stack has been obtained using confocal or super-resolution microscopy, generate an orthogonal projection to view the vesicles in the z-axis of the cell in a 2D view (compared to 3D reconstruction). To do this, click on the Processing > Method and select Orthogonal Projection.",
    "Under parameters, select the projection plane required. For a projection of the z-axis (z-stack), select the Frontal (XY) plane. Under Method, select Maximum to result in the highest quality projection.\nNext, determine the thickness of the projection by selecting the starting position (starting z-slice), and determine the thickness (total number of z-slices) in the projection. It is ideal to select the thickness equal to that of one cell in the z-axis.\nOnce the parameters have been set, click on Apply to create the projection of the z-stack in an XY plane manner.\n\t\tNOTE: When creating orthogonal projections of multiple z-stacks to compare the amount of a particular object of interest, it is imperative to keep the thickness of the projection the same (or as close as possible) for data accuracy.\nPerform 3D reconstruction as described below (Figure 5).\n\t\nCreate 3D reconstructions of z-stacks to observe the localization and shape of structures. Do this for z-stacks acquired using confocal and super-resolution approaches. Process super-resolution z-stacks first using 3D processing as in step 7.8 for 3D reconstruction.\nTo generate a 3D image, click on the 3D icon in the preview window. Once clicked, a 3D tab will appear in the display control section in the bottom half of the screen. 3D views, such as Transparency, Volume, Maximum, Surface, and Mixed will be visible. Use Surface or Mixed views when viewing the structure of vesicles (preferable).\nFor the highest quality image, select the Precise setting, as the fastest setting will be less accurate and lead to poor 3D rendering.\nOnce the image has been generated, manipulate it by rotating and zooming to focus on a preferred location to view the objects of interest. Manipulate the 3D image under the Appearance tab.",
    "Once a satisfactory view has been obtained, under the 3D tab, select Displayed Resolution, and then click on Create Image. This will create a snapshot of the image in the same orientation as it was viewed and can be saved and exported in various file formats.\nGenerate an intensity profile as described below (Figure 7).\n\tNOTE: The distribution and intensity profiles of the pixels associated with the different fluorescent signals can be viewed as an overlay image to determine their colocalization.\n\t\nOnce an optimal image has been acquired via confocal or super-resolution imaging, in the View panel of the Preview window, click on Profile. In the preview window, a histogram displaying the intensity profile as a function of distance will appear, as well as a table showing distances and intensity values.\nIn the display controls area at the bottom of the screen, click on the Arrow Tool in the Profile Definition tab. Draw an arrow along the length of the object for which the intensity profile of the different pixels needs to be assessed. To draw the arrow, zoom in on the image.\nThe intensity profile will appear on the left of the image preview, where the distance and the corresponding peaks along the path of the arrow will be displayed. To remove the histogram displayed on the image itself, uncheck the Show Profile in Graphics box.\nIn the Dimensions tab in the display control area, deselect any channels that are not to be included in the intensity profile.\nIn the Graphics tab, double-click on Profile shown under the Annotations/Measurements box to open the Format Graphical Elements pop-up box. Use this to change the color of the arrow as well as its style and stroke thickness. Close the box after selecting the desired settings.",
    "Click on the Profile View tab. In the new image section, click on Current View and then on Save As to save the file. It is recommended to save the file as a .tif file to avoid data compression and loss.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
