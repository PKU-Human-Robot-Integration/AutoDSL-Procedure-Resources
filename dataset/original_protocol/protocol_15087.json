    "1. Seeding of Endothelial Cells into Well Plates\nCultivate murine brain microvascular endothelial cells (cEND) in T75 culture flask, changing the medium (DMEM containing 10% FCS, 50 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 1% L-glutamine) twice a week, until confluence is reached. (For the generation and immortalization of brain microvascular endothelial cells, please see Burek et al., 2012; Förster et al., 200521,19).\nWash the cells with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Remove the PBS and trypsinize the cells with 2 ml warm trypsin-EDTA solution.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C for 5 min or until the cell layer is dispersed.\nAdd 8 ml culture medium into the cells. Tap the flask several times to detach the cells.\nView cells under the microscope to ensure complete detachment from flask.\nPipette medium with detached cells up and down. Swirl the flask to mix the cell suspension.\nTake 20 µl of the cell suspension, put into a hemocytometer and count the number of cells.\nDetermine the cell density and seed 20,000 cells/cm2 into the well.\nTransfer the cell suspension into collagen1 precoated 6-well flexible-bottomed culture plates (57.75 cm2) in a total volume of 3 ml/ well. Each well has an area of 9.62 cm2.\nGrow the cells at 37 °C for one week until confluent. Change the culture medium twice per week.\n2. Cell Differentiation Prior to Stretch-induced Injury\nChange the culture medium of the cells with differentiation medium (DMEM containing 1% serum-stripped fetal calf serum (ssFCS), 50 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin).\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C for 24 hr.\n3. Stretch-induced Injury of Endothelial Cells\nTurn on the cell injury controller device.\nSet the delay to 50 msec.\nSet the regulator pressure to 15 psi and press the trigger a couple of times until the registered peak pressure becomes stable.",
    "Set the regulator pressure to the desired value. Use Table 1 as a guide for generating various degrees of stretch injury.\nPlace the 6-well flexible-bottomed culture plate (57.75 cm2) into the tray holder. Make sure that the well selector is set to the correct well size (i.e. large well).\nPlace the adapter plug firmly over the well. Hold the plug firmly into place with one hand while the other hand pushes the trigger.\nRecord the peak pressure generated.\nImmediately put the plate back into the 37 °C incubator for the desired length of time or use immediately for succeeding experiments or evaluation.\n4. Assessment of Stretch Injury by Dye Uptake Assay\nImmediately after the cells were stretched (step 3.7), add 30 µl of a 1 mg/ml solution of the viability stain that acts as a cytotoxicity marker (please see supplemental table of materials and equipment) to the cell culture medium (Note: 10 µl of the dye solution is to be used for every ml of cell culture medium).\nUpon addition of the dye to the cells, immediately view under a fluorescence microscope.\n5. Assessment of Stretch Injury by Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Release\nImmediately after stretching the cells (step 3.7), remove 200 µl of cell culture medium from the well. Do the same for every time point post-injury you would like to include in your investigation of LDH release (i.e. e.g. 30 min, 1 hr, 2 hr, etc.)\nCentrifuge the cell culture medium at the highest setting of a microcentrifuge for 5 min to remove any cell debris. Remove the supernatant and use this for the succeeding steps.",
    "Once you have finished step 5.1 and have taken the necessary samples you would like to have from the various time points you would like to investigate, lyse the cells using the lysis solution included in the LDH assay kit (please see supplemental table of materials and equipment).\nPut 100 µl of the assay medium included in the assay kitto every well of a 96-wells plate provided in the kit.\nPut 100 µl of the cell-free cell culture medium into two parallel wells of a 96-wells plate included in the assay kit.\nIncubate the plate at 37 °C for 30 min.\nRead the absorbance at 492 nm."
