    "This study was approved by the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa ethics committee. Informed consent to participate was obtained before the procedure from each subject.\n1. Preparation of the structural images\nRecord a high-resolution T1-weighted structural MRI of the whole head for each subject (preferably with a 0 mm slice gap and 1 mm slice thickness). Acquire the images as specified in the neuronavigation system's instructions.\nUpload the MR images to the navigation system in its preferred format (typically DICOM or NifTI).\nGo through the MR images, and check for any errors (e.g., blurry cardinal points, noise disturbances, or misplacements in the 3D model reconstruction).\nFind the cardinal points (i.e., the middle of the ridge in each earlobe and the nasion) in the axial, sagittal, and coronal MRI planes, mark them by pressing the crosshair function in the planes, and choose the exact spot by clicking the left button of the mouse. Then, press the \"add landmarks\" button with the mouse.\nInsert parcellations of the brain areas of interest (e.g., pinpointed by other functional methods [MEG, fMRI, PET] or based on MRI databases or atlases)21. Choose the \"overlay image\" function.\n2. Preparation for neuronavigation\nCheck that the subject does not have any metal items (e.g., earrings) in the head and neck area, and ensure that there are no absolute contraindications such as intracranial metal clips.\nPlace the subject in the patient chair. Adjust the chair so that the subject is sitting comfortably, with the neck, hands, and legs relaxed. Adjust the chair height so that the operator can comfortably stimulate the whole hemisphere under investigation.",
    "Place the head tracker so that it is stabilized during the stimulation session (with a sticker or a strap) and does not block the TMS coil from being moved freely over the head, especially over the temporal areas. The tracker may be situated slightly right on the forehead if the left hemisphere is stimulated and vice versa if the right hemisphere is stimulated to ensure that the anterior frontal lobe areas can be stimulated.\nCo-register the subject's head to the MRI-reconstructed 3D head model. Use a digitizing pen on the participant's head to mark the cardinal points (nasion, pre-auricular points) that were selected on the MRIs. Digitize additional points over the whole skull surface to reduce the final registration error. Place the digitizing pen over each highlighted spot on the 3D head model, and press the left pedal when the spot starts blinking on the navigator screen.\nValidate the registration, even if the overall error is acceptable (below 4 mm). Touch the subject's head with the tip of the digitizing pen. Double-check visually that the pen is at the analogous place on the surface of the 3D MRI-based model. If its position does not correspond to the point in the MRI, repeat steps 2.1-2.4.\nEnsure that both the subject and the operator wear ear protection before starting the stimulation.\n3. Defining the hot spot and motor threshold for M1 stimulation\nFor determining the resting motor threshold (rMT), choose a distal hand muscle (e.g., the abductor pollicis brevis [APB]) from the right hand.\n\tNOTE. The motor threshold is used to define the initial stimulation intensity, which may be subsequently changed as explained below. Thus, any distal hand muscle can be used for this purpose.",
    "Place a single-use gel electrode (diameter: ~30 mm) over the right APB (the belly of the muscle), and another on the middle of the thumb (tendon). Place the ground electrode near the wrist (or follow the manufacturer's guidelines).\nConnect the electrodes to the electromyography (EMG) amplifier, and verify that the APB is at rest by observing the continuous EMG signal. Change the position of the hand if the recorded muscle cannot be easily relaxed.\nFind the cortical hot spot for determining the APB motor threshold. Starting from the motor hand knob area22, deliver a few TMS pulses, and continue by moving and rotating the coil until APB motor evoked potentials (MEPs) appear.\n\tNOTE: Usually, motor representations of the thumb are located perpendicular to the lateral wall of the hand knob.\n\t\nChoose a TMS intensity that evokes MEPs of around 200-500 µV. Optimize the coil location and orientation by slightly changing its angle to evoke the maximum MEPs.\nSave the optimal coil location in the neuronavigation software by right-clicking over the pulse number corresponding to the hot spot site and choosing the option to repeat the stimulus. Repeat the stimuli, and apply an automatic threshold hunting algorithm23 by right-clicking on the hot spot and choosing the option of motor threshold from the neuronavigation software.\nIf these options are not available, apply the rule that a TMS pulse needs to evoke 10 MEPs (≥50 µV) out of 20 trials24.\n4. Baseline naming of images\nFamiliarize the subject with the images before the baseline object naming task11,12. Print the images (or show them in digital format), and let the subject practice before the session starts (the subject could also practice at home).\n\t\nUse properly standardized normalized color images (e.g., from the Bank of Standardized Stimuli25; Supplementary Figure 1).",
    "Use only images that are frequently seen in an everyday environment, have a minimal number of synonyms, and have high name agreement.\nIf available, attach an accelerometer on the skin above the larynx and the vocal cords to record the speech onset, as explained in Vitikainen et al.26.\nShow the images to the subject one by one and ask them to name the images aloud without stimulation.\n\t\nPresent the images to the subject on a screen placed at a 0.5-1 m distance.\nUse a display time of 700-1,000 ms per image.\nAdjust the inter-picture interval (IPI) to make the task slightly challenging for each subject (e.g., start with 2,500 ms, and vary between 1,500-4,000 ms).\n\t\nIf many errors occur during the baseline naming task, increase the IPI in steps of 200-300 ms. If the task is too easy, decrease the IPI in steps of 200-300 ms.\nFor the actual speech mapping session with nrTMS, omit the images that during the baseline testing were not trained adequately, not named correctly, not named clearly, not articulated correctly, named with delay or hesitance, or seemed difficult for the subject.\nRun the baseline naming task three times, and repeat steps 4.3-4.5 if performance is not satisfactory.\n5. Speech cortical mapping\nVary the stimulation intensity by increasing/decreasing it in steps of 1% of the stimulator's output so that each target area receives the same induced electric field (E-field), as defined for the rMT of the hand muscles at the cortical hand motor hotspot. Usually, higher intensities need to be applied for parietal than for frontotemporal targets to reach similar cortical E-fields as for the rMT hotspot.\n\t\nLower the intensity when stimulating cortical structures located closer to the head surface (E-field above the pre-defined rMT E-field).",
    "Check before starting the stimulation that the induced E-field values are approximately similar (with a 2-3 V/m difference) in the different speech-related areas in both hemispheres.\n\t\nAdjust the cortical depth (peeling depth) if needed.\nEnsure that the coil center is not in the air.\nStart with a default picture-to-TMS interval (PTI) of 300 ms, or use a 0-400 ms PTI; a PTI above 150 ms is preferred to optimize the overlap of stimulation with language processing.\nStart with five pulses at a 5 Hz stimulation rate. Start from a cortical area not related to speech processing so that the subject gets used to the sensation induced by the stimulation. Then, move the coil to the expected speech-related areas.\nKeep the coil in the same position until the pulse train is over and the subject's naming is completed.\nFocus on the subject's performance as described below.\n\t\nIf no error is observed, move on to the next locus.\nIf an error, or even a hesitation, is observed, continue stimulating that site for an additional two to three nrTMS trains, and then move on. Keep the site in mind for possible later re-stimulation.\nMake small coil adjustments when even a slight error is detected (e.g., minor hesitation or a louder voice during the naming due to an increased effort) to provoke clearer errors.\nAvoid repeating stimulation on the same site for more than five consecutive trains. Continue with other cortical sites, and revisit the site later.\nIf repeated errors appear at several stimulated locations, lift the coil in the air above the scalp, and check if errors still occur.\nIf errors still occur, take a break, and wait until the naming returns to normal.",
    "​NOTE. Repeated naming errors unrelated to the stimulation may be common if speech-related areas are affected by a tumor or other lesion.\nStimulate in blocks of 7-10 min (maximum) continuously, and have 2-5 min breaks in between.\n\t\tNOTE: Errors become more common with long stimulations and if the subject is tired.\nStimulate all the possibly related anatomical areas (e.g., IFG, STG, SMG, middle temporal, precentral, postcentral, and angular gyri, and the prefrontal cortex) to obtain as many control responses as possible.\nIf feasible and/or clinically supported, stimulate both hemispheres. Stimulate carefully inside and around the tumor region or the estimated location of the lesion even if those regions do not belong to the classical speech-related areas (for tumor and epilepsy patients).\n\t\nInvestigate cortical areas that are located away from the lesion site to identify possible spatial shifts in the language areas due to plastic changes or the mass effect, especially in patients with large lesions.\nReduce the TMS intensity in steps of 2%-5% of the maximum stimulator output if the mapping induces pain or discomfort.\nStop the measurement if the induced pain or discomfort are not tolerated by the subject.\n6. Strategy when no naming errors occur\nTerminate the stimulation, and change stimulation parameters.\nDecrease the IPI in steps of 200 ms from the default value (e.g., from 2,500 ms to 2,300 ms).\nChange the frequency of pulse delivery from 5 Hz to 7 Hz. Change the interval between the onset of the presented image and the rTMS (currently, there is no consensus on whether to increase or decrease it). Increase the stimulation intensity (without evoking discomfort).\n7. Off-line analysis of the evoked naming errors\nCollaborate with an expert (e.g., a neuropsychologist), who should optimally be present in the operating room.",
    "Double-check the evoked naming errors by observing the coil positioning and possible pain interference from the video recordings.\nClassify the errors according to Corina et al.27 (e.g., anomia, semantic and phonological paraphasia, performance errors).\n\t\nIf a particular type of error repeats itself in the baseline video, do not consider it as an error when analyzing the stimulation session videos.\nIf an object is named after the rTMS train, consider this as a delay or a no-error; check also for possible discomfort of the subject during the pulse delivery.\nIf the subject cannot name a given object although the tongue, lips, and jaws are moving, record a no-response error.\nIf an image is named differently in each session, discard it.\nIf unsure, control the performance of the neighboring stimulation site or the effect of the stimulation of the other hemisphere with the same image."
