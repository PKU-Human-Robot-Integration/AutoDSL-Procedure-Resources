    "1. Preparation of capillary and DNA solution for injection\nPurify plasmid DNA with a Maxi-prep or equivalent method, and make a final concentration of 2-3 μg/μl.  Aliquot 100 μg of DNA, add 10μl of fast green dye (1% stock) and TE (10mM Tris Base, 1mM EDTA Solution, pH 8.0) and adjust a volume to 100 μl to make the final DNA concentration for injection mix to 1μg/μl.   The concentration of plasmid DNA can be changed depends on the size of plasmid, and also its transfection efficiency, which needs to be tested individually.\n Spin the DNA solution for 5 minutes at 14,000 RPM at room temperature and collect supernatant to remove any residue.\nPull a glass capillary tubea glass capillary tubes using a micropipette puller. Pinch off the tip with forceps to make the tip has a 20–30 μm diameter.  Measure 800 μm-1 mm from the tip and check the external diameter is less than 60 μm (Fig. 1A). \nConnect the capillary to the micromanipulator, and fill with mineral oil. To fill the capillary with the DNA solution, submerge the tip into the solution and suck up the DNA solution.  \n2. Stick platinum electrodes \nHere we used stick platinum electrodes (Nepe gene, CUY611P2-1) to electroporate into superficial region of brain, such as the cortex (Fig. 1F).  \n3. Preparation of micro-electrodes\nUse micro-electrodes to electroporated into deep parts of the brain (i.e., thalamus and hypothalamus) (Fig. 2B-E). \nOne end of the tungsten (for negative electrodes) and platinum (for positive electrodes) wires is coiled on gold-plated pins and fixed with parafilm. Insert the wire to the stem of a cotton swab and wrap both ends with parafilm (Fig. 1B).",
    "Evenly sharpen the tip of the wire with sandpaper until it reaches 20–30 μm external diameter and 60 μm from 800 μm-1 mm of the tip (Fig. 1C and D).\nApply a thin coat of nail polish to the wire for insulation. After the nail polish has dried, use an acetone-soaked cotton swab to remove it from the tip (about 200 μm from the tip). \n\tImportant note: In order to prevent damage to the mouse’s uterus, the portion within 800 μm-1 mm of the tip should be no more than 70 μm in diameter (Fig. 1E). \n4. Preparation of the surgery \nAnesthetize a pregnant mouse (E9.5-E15.5). We demonstrate anesthetization with pharmaceutical grade sodium pentobarbital (Table II; 50 μg per gram body weight, inject intraperitoneally and wait for 5 min). Alternatives to sodium pentobarbital as an anesthetic include Ketamine/Xylazine injection or gas anesthetics (gas is preferable for short duration procedures). The injection should be done with attention to avoid any organs, otherwise it will cause to damage the uterus or kill animal. When successful IP is done, the survival rate is more than 95%. Also the surgery can be performed in open-air environment. Before started the operation, test for a lack of response by the animal to pinching their toe to confirm anesthetic.\nShave the hair from the abdomen using a razor blade and 50% EtOH. Prepare the skin with alternating scrubs of betadine and alcohol (70%).\nMake an incision at the abdominal midline with fine scissors and pull out all uterine horns carefully onto a 37 °C pre-warmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-moistened cotton gauze, which is placed around the wound. Keep the uterus moist with PBS all of the time.",
    "Hold a flexible fiber optic cable between the index and middle fingers and place it under the uterine horn. Clean cable with 70% EtOH prior to use. No microscope or magnifier is required for visualization. Position uterus between the optic fiber light optic cable and the thumb, and squeeze gently to push up the embryo closer to the uterine wall.\n5. Injection of DNA and electroporation \nWhen embryo is positioned, insert glass capillary carefully into target ventricle and inject approx 1 μl of DNA solution (Fig. 2A).\nFor electroporation to superficial part of the brainIf using with stick platinum electrodes for electoporation, place the electrodes outside of the uterus and apply suggested square-wave current pulses according to manufacture’s instruction (Table I).  If usingFor electroporation to deeper part of the brain,  nmicro electroporation, eedle type electrodes are used.  Iinsert a fine tungsten negative electrode into DNA injected ventricle and a platinum electrode into the uterus and place target region between two electrodes, then apply suggested square-wave current pulses (Table I) (Fig. 2B).\n6. Post electroporation\nPlace the uterine horn back in its original location with and add 500 μL of 37 °C pre-warmed PBS.\nSuture the inner layer with surgical suture and close outer layer with a 9 mm autoclipauto clip. \nPlace animals on a heating pad for 2 hours to allow recovery from anesthesia. Analgesics such as carprofen or buprenorphine can be administered for post operative pain.\n7. Representative results:",
    "Some examples of cortical electroporation of pCAG-EYFP construct using stick platinum electrodes at different time points are shown in figure Figure 32.  Brains are electroporated at E13.5, E14.5 and E15.5, and harvested at postnatal day (P) 6.  AThe ntibody staining of RORc reveals position of layer 4 and position of EYFP transfected cells are revealed by GFP antibody staining, and both images are super imposed (Fig. 3A and B).  Labeled cortical cells are layer of cortical cells electroporated is clearly different in each experiment (Fig. 32), which suggests time- dependent electroporation makes cortical layer-specific GOF/LOF possible. \nThe viability of embryos and efficiency of cell transfection varies depending on the age of embryo and the location of electroporation. Samples are listed on Table 1, however, conditions should be optimized for each electroporation depending on the stage and part of the brain.\nElectroporation into a deep tissue such as thalamus and hypothalamus with using stick platinum electrodes often give low efficiency (Table 1).  This problem can be solved by using micro-electrodes whichelectrodes, which will reach to deep parts of the brain.  Figure 3 4 shows example of pCAG-EYFP electroporation into the developing diencephalon.  Plasmid DNA solution is injected into the 3rd ventricle at E11.5 and followed by micro electroporation (Fig. 3C4C).  The electroporated area is restricted in the thalamus where most of the axons project to the cortex (Fig. 3B4B).  Axon projection to layer 4 of the cortex can be also visualized by EYFP, which fillesfills up the entire neuron. (Fig.  3A4A).",
