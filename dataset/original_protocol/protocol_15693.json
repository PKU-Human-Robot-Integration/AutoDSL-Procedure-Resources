    "All animals used in this study were obtained, housed, cared for, and used in accordance with the \"Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of Animals in the Field of Physiologic Sciences\" published by the Physiologic Society of Japan20, and with the previous approval of the Animal Care Committee of the University of Yamanashi (Yamanashi, Japan).\n1. Preparation of cell medium, transplantation medium, and anesthesia mixture\nPrepare the cell medium by adding 10% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin in DMEM.\nPrepare the transplantation medium by adding hCSF1 (250 ng/mL) and hTGF-β1 (100 ng/mL) to the cell medium.\nPrepare the anesthesia mixture for intraperitoneal injection by mixing 0.45 mL of medetomidine hydrochloride, 1.2 mL of midazolam, and 1.5 mL of butorphanol tartrate in 11.8 mL of normal saline.\n2. Preparation of iPSMG\nNOTE: Frozen iPSMG (Table of Materials) were kept at -80 °C until use.\nThaw the frozen cells quickly in a 37 °C water bath. Swirl the samples until all visible ice has melted.\nAdd the thawed iPSMG to the culture media warmed to 37 °C. Add 1 mL of thawed cells containing medium (1 × 106 cells) to 10 mL of the culture media.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 min to obtain a cell pellet.\nAfter centrifugation, remove all supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet. Complete removal of supernatant is desirable to reduce dilution of the cytokine concentration in the transplantation medium.\nAdd the transplantation medium to obtain a cell concentration of 1 x 105 cells/µL.\nPlace the iPSMG on ice and immediately proceed to transplantation.\n\t​NOTE: Preparation of iPSMG for transplantation is performed on a clean bench to avoid contamination.\n3. Preparation of mouse for transnasal transplantation (Tsn)",
    "Feed the wild-type male mice (C57BL/6J, 8 weeks old) with PLX5622 containing diet for 7 days.\nAt the end of the 7th day, cease the PLX diet and feed the mice with a normal diet till the end of study.\n\tNOTE: PLX5622 containing diet is prepared by adding 1.2 g of PLX5622 in 1 kg of AIN-93G (Table of Materials).\n4. Transnasal transplantation of cells\n24 h after the cessation of PLX feeding, weigh the mice and anesthetize them using an intraperitoneal injection of the anesthesia mixture (0.2 mL/20 g).\nAfter the mice are completely anesthetized as assessed by unresponsiveness to pedal withdrawal reflex (firm toe pinch), administer 2.5 µL of hyaluronidase in PBS (100 U/mL) at 1 h before Tsn of iPSMG to each nostril twice using a 10 µL pipette tip to increase the permeability of the nasal mucosa.\nAfter the application of hyaluronidase, place the mice in the supine position.\nRepeat step 4.2 10 min before the transnasal transplantation of iPSMG.\nApply 2.5 µL of cell suspension into one nostril of the mouse using a 10 µL pipette tip.\nPlace the mouse in the supine position for 5 min before administration of cell suspension to the other nostril.\nRepeat steps 4.5 and 4.6 four times, applying a total volume of 20 µL per animal.\nPlace the mouse in the supine position on a 37 °C heat pad until recovery from anesthesia.\nAt 48 h after the cessation of PLX feeding, repeat steps 4.1-4.7 on the same mice once again.\n\t​NOTE: It should be noted that iPSMG are placed on ice during the transplantation.\n5. Application of cytokines\nAnesthetize the mice by an intraperitoneal injection of anesthesia mixture (0.2 mL/20 g).",
    "Apply 2.5 µL of the transplantation medium into one nostril of the mouse using a 10 µL pipette tip.\nPlace the mouse in the supine position for 5 min before administering the transplantation medium to the other nostril.\nRepeat steps 5.2 and 5.3 four times, applying a total volume of 20 µL per animal.\n\tNOTE: It should be noted that transnasal administration of transplantation medium (human cytokines) is required every 12 h for the viability of transplanted iPSMG till the end of the study."
