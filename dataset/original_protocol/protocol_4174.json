    "Thermal Shift Assay (TSA) test run for the determination of optimal amount of protein   Prepare a dilution series of your protein sample in buffer ranging from 1 to 10 μM final concentration in a total volume of 25 μl. Add 1 μl of 1x SYPRO® Orange to each tube.   Perform a thermal cycler run using the parameters as described in step 3. Analyze the melt-curve (see step 4) and determine the optimal amount of protein that gives at least 30 fluorescence unit. Reduce amount of protein if the fluorescence signal is saturated.  Notes: Typical final protein concentration is around 5 μM. The Rotor-Gene® 3000 is equiped  with a gain optimization function that can be adjusted for optimal signal (refer to manufacturer’s manual).     Assay   Start by defining the number of conditions that you need to test, including appropriate controls such as protein sample in buffer only if testing nucleotide binding, or in presence of DMSO if testing compounds. This will determine the total volume of master mix of protein needed to conduct the entire experiment. Each reaction is conducted in a total volume of 25 μl.   Prepare on ice just prior use a master mix containing your protein in the Thermal Shift Assay buffer using the concentration of protein that gave the peak fluorescence (without signal saturation) in step 1.    Dispense 23 μl of protein/buffer, add 1 μl of ligand (10 to 200 μM) or 1 μl of DMSO/buffer for the control experiment and 1 μl of diluted SYPRO® Orange (1:100). Prepare tubes in duplicate. If the protein to test is highly unstable at room temperature, it is recommended to prepare the tubes on ice. Nucleotide solutions are typically used at a final concentration of 200 μM final, divalent cations at 1 mM final and kinase inhibitors at 40 μM final.",
    "Thermal cycler program   Fluorescence-based Thermal Shift Assay can be performed using instruments that combine both sample temperature control and dye fluorescence detection. In this instance, we used the Qiagen/Corbett Rotor-Gene® 3000 RT-PCR machine.    Start at 25 °C, hold at 25 °C for 2 min, increase temperature of 1 °C/min for 65 cycles (25 °C to 90 °C) reading fluorescence intensity every °C. Return to 25 °C. Excitation is at 470 nm (green chanel) and emission is at 555 nm (yellow chanel).     Data analysis   Save data as fluorescence intensity vs temperature. Export file in a format suitable for import into Microsoft Excel or Prism for analyses.   The highest fluorescence density is used as a cutoff for the data, therefore remove all data after the high fluroescence density peak. Fit fluorescence intensity curve to a Boltzmann sigmoidal curve using Prism.    Obtain the melting temperature (Tm) of the protein in buffer/DMSO, which correspond to the midpoint for the protein unfolding curve. Similarly, obtain the Tm of the protein when ligand is added.    Calculate ΔTm = Tm ligand - Tm buffer/DMSO. A positive ΔTm indicates that the ligand stabilizes the protein from denaturation, hence binds to the protein. A value ≥ to 2-3 °C is an indicator of ligand binding.    Below is an example of a typical TSA experiment. Notes: If PRISM software is not available, non-linear regression analysis of experimental data can be conducted using a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Brown, 2001).    imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20140530/20140530193639_0113.jpg Figure 1. Practical example of a TSA experiment. (Top) Thermal Shift Assay data were obtained for mouse MLKL in the presence and absence of nucleotides. The midpoint for the unfolding transition in the absence of ligand was observed to be 44.8 °C while the Tm shifted to 53.8 °C in presence of ATP, inducing a shift of 9 °C.",
