Isolation of exosomes from cancer cell culture medium\n(A) Overview of exosome separation.\n(B) Cleared media are transferred to an ultracentrifuge tube and the appearance of the exosome pellet is observed after ultracentrifugation.\n(C) After isolation, exosomes are characterized using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and immunoblotting. Some figure elements were created using BioRender.com[href=http://BioRender.com].\nNote: All cell lines should be mycoplasma-tested prior to exosome isolation.\nCritical: For short-term (<24 h) cultures, it is advisable to utilize serum-free media to prevent contamination of bovine proteins and exosomes in the conditioned culture medium. For long-term cell cultures, the use of exosome-depleted FBS media can be considered based on downstream applications and experimental objectives.\nCritical: For functional assays, particularly for protein aggregation, we suggest creating fresh exosome isolates. These can be kept in storage at 4°C (<24 h) and used the following day. However, avoid storage at 4°C for a prolonged duration.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nSeed 3 × 106 cells and culture MCF7-shCtrl and shGPR143 cells in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum-cultured cells at 37°C in 5% CO2.\nChange serum-free EMEM medium when cells reach 80% confluence.\nCollect the supernatant of cancer cells after 24 h.\nIsolation of exosomes by serial ultracentrifugation (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nNote: All steps are performed at 4°C. Supernatant and the re-suspended exosome pellet should be kept on ice between isolation steps.",
    "Remove cell debris from culture medium by sequential centrifugation at 300 × g for 10 min, 3,000 × g for 10 min, and 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nFilter the supernatant using a 0.22-μm stericup filter unit.\nPause point: Conditioned media supernatant can be stored at −80°C for long-term storage (up to 6 months) or 4°C for short-term storage (<24 h) before ultracentrifugation.\nUltracentrifuge the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 90 min. Collect exosomes from the pellet and resuspend in cold PBS.\nCentrifuge the re-suspended pellet at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4°C to collect the washed exosome pellet (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nDiscard the PBS supernatant by decanting and remove all liquid by gently tapping the inverted tube to avoid backflow.\nNote: After this step, performing additional centrifugation at 10,000 × g would further enhance the purity of isolated exosomes.\nResuspend the exosome pellet in 100 μL (depending on the experimental scale) cold PBS and store at −80°C.\nReserve aliquots for downstream quantification and characterization, such as protein quantification, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), to avoid freeze-thaw cycles (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C).\nCritical: It is very important to accurately balance the tubes in the ultracentrifuge. An unbalanced rotor can cause spillage, contamination, or run failure and can even damage the rotor/ultracentrifuge.\nQuantify exosomes through total protein quantification using a BCA protein assay kit.\nPause point: Exosomes can be characterized as described below and used immediately or stored at −80°C for 3 months.\nDetermine the size distribution and number of exosomes using NTA.\nNote: The Nanosight NS500 and NTA3.1 programs (Malvern) are used in this protocol.\nDilute exosomes with PBS to make a sample concentration range of 0.05–0.1 μg/μL.",
    "Critical: For optimal resolution, we empirically determined that using 50–100 μg of exosome protein is recommended for NTA analysis with our instrument settings. The size of the sample injection loop determines the maximum sample volume that can be loaded, necessitating a sample concentration range of 0.05–0.1 μg/μL (typically 108–109 particles/mL) for NTA. It is important to consider that for exosomes derived from different cell types or tissues, these parameters may require empirical optimization due to variations in exosome complexity.\nUse these solutions for measuring the size of particles with the NanoSight NS500 using NTA software 3.1 (Malvern) following the manufacturer’s instructions[href=https://www.malvernpanalytical.com/en/support/product-support/nanosight-range/nanosight-ns500].\nTurn on the equipment and start the NTA v.3.1 program.\nConnect the peristaltic pump tubing to the bottle containing PBS, which is used as the diluent, and place the sample tubing into the waste port.\nClick the ‘Prime Fluidics’ button to fill the sample chamber and tubing with diluent.\nVortex the sample tube containing the exosomes and place into the sample tray.\nPlace the sample tubing into the sample tube and press the ‘Load’ button.\nNote: Ensure that the tubing reaches down to the bottom of the tube to avoid air being introduced when loading samples.\nAfter loading the sample, set the camera level to the maximum value and press the ‘Start Camera’ button.\nAdjust the camera level so that all particles can be seen clearly without too much saturation.\nNote: The optimal number of particles in the field of view is between 10 and 100, with particle concentrations ranging from 1 × 108 to 109 particles/mL. Concentrate or dilute the sample appropriately.\nAdjust the focus and take the measurement.\nAfter capturing the video, set the detection threshold by checking the frame particle count and noise level in each frame.",
    "Note: The detection threshold setting must not be altered between videos for the same sample measurement.\nStart the measurement process and export the data.\nMove sample tubing to the waste port and flush the sample chamber and all tubing before the next sample.\nRepeat steps f-l.\nAt the end of the experiment, empty the fluidic system.\nDetection of exosomal markers by western blot.\nResuspend 0.5 mg exosome pellet in 250 μL RIPA buffer (with protease inhibitor added) and vortex for 30 s.\nPlace on ice for 5 min to allow complete lysis.\nAdd 2× SDS buffer and heat at 95°C for 5 min. Chill on ice before loading onto the gel.\nPerform standard SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and western transfer onto a PVDF membrane.\nBlock with 5% non-fatty acid milk in Tris-buffered saline + 0.05% Tween (TBST) for 1 h.\nIncubate the blot at 4°C (<18 h) with exosome marker primary antibody.\nWash three times with TBST for 10 min each.\nIncubate for 1 h at 20°C–25°C with secondary antibody.\nIncubate with western blotting substrate and visualize using ImageLab.\nOptional: Isolated tumor-derived exosomes can be used to evaluate their effects on different functions of cancer cells or cells in the cancer microenvironment, including proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion, in an in vitro setting.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1] The ideal exosome concentration and treatment duration will vary depending on the specific cell line chosen.\nGeneration of lung metastasis animal model\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThis section describes the establishment of a 4T1 breast cancer lung metastasis model. We designed this protocol with ref.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nPreparation of cancer cells.\nThaw 4T1 cells in a 37°C water bath and culture cells with complete growth media in a 10-cm dish at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator.",
    "Split the cells every 2 days for two to three passages before injection. This is normally a sub-culture. Apply 6 mL pre-warmed Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle medium to each dish and use a 10-mL pipettor to dissociate into single cells.\nNote: We recommend letting the cells grow for around 1 week to recover from the liquid nitrogen. 4T1 cells should be passaged when they reach 70%–80% confluence. We do not recommend using cells that are too confluent, as this can compromise cell viability.\nOptional: Labeling cell lines with fluorescence or luciferase allows for continuous monitoring of lung metastasis using imaging instruments.\nCritical: Cells should be tested for mycoplasma contamination before use. If possible, low-passage (i.e., fewer than six passages) cells should be used.\nTransfer cells to a 15-mL conical tube and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in pre-warmed complete growth medium.\nPlace cells back into a new 10-cm dish.\nPrepare 4T1 cells for intravenous implantation. Each mouse will be injected with 1 × 105 living cells in 100 μL PBS.\nRemove growth medium by aspiration and rinse cells with 5 mL PBS in each well.\nApply 2 mL Trypsin-EDTA and place the 10-cm dish in a 37°C incubator for 1 min. Inspect the dish and ensure the complete detachment of cells by gently tapping the side of the dish with the palm of the hand.\nApply 5 mL pre-warmed growth medium to each dish. Use a 1-mL pipettor to mix the cells several times and ensure they dissociate into single cells.\nTransfer the cells to a 15-mL conical tube. Take 50 μL cells to a 1.5-mL centrifuge tube and mix with the same volume of trypan blue.",
    "Transfer 10 μL staining cell suspension to a hemocytometer and count cells under a microscope.\nNote: We recommend counting 100–200 cells in the hemocytometer, as this range provides the most reliability and accuracy. We recommend using cells with >90% cell viability.\nAdd additional growth medium to the 15-mL conical tube to achieve a total volume of 10 mL. Centrifuge the tube at 300 × g for 5 min to pellet the cells.\nCarefully discard the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.\nAdd 1 mL PBS to the 15-mL conical tube, gently resuspend the cell pellet with a pipettor.\nTransfer all cells to a 1.5-mL centrifuge tube. Centrifuge the cells at 400 × g for 5 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet. Use P200 and then P10 tips to remove any residual liquid.\nAdd a calculated volume of PBS to the cell pellet to achieve a cell density of 1 × 105 cells/100 μL\nGently mix the cells, and put them on ice. The cells are now ready for intravenous injection.\nCritical: Although we find that cells kept in PBS on ice show 90% survival for 4 h, preparing fresh cells every 2 h is recommended if you have many mice that need injections.\nIncubate 4T1 cells (density 1 × 105 cells/100 μL) with MCF7-shCtrl or -shGPR143 cell-derived exosomes (10 μg/mouse) in the 1.5 mL centrifuge tube for 30 min at 37°C.\nNote: Do not vortex or rotate the cell/exosome mixture.\nKeep the tubes on ice during injections.\nCritical: Ensure that cells are kept on ice and injected immediately after preparation.\nIntravenous injection.\nPrior to injection, place mouse cages no closer than 15 cm in front of a heat lamp for 5–10 min until tail vein dilation.",
    "Optional: Mice may also be warmed by using a warming box or warm water.\nCritical: Be careful to avoid overheating the mice.\nLoad a syringe with the cell/exosome mixture or PBS using a 31-gauge sterile needle. Ensure there are no air bubbles in the syringe.\nInject 120 μL cell/exosome mixture or PBS as a control into the lateral tail vein of 6-week-old female BALB/c nu/nu athymic mice.\nInject exosomes through the tail vein twice a week for a duration of two weeks.\nTwo weeks after exosome injection (10 μg/mouse), evaluate lung metastasis.\nNote: The health condition of mice should be monitored daily after injection.\nNote: In parallel with the 4T1 mouse model, we established a metastasis mouse model using the MCF7 human breast cancer cell line to investigate the impact of tumor-derived exosomes on metastasis. In this model, we injected 1 × 106 MCF7 cells along with either exosomes (10 μg in 100 μL PBS) or 100 μL PBS as control into the tail veins of 6-week-old female BALB/c nu/nu athymic mice. Exosomes were administered through the tail vein twice per week. Mice were sacrificed 6 weeks after cell injection following the same procedure as described in this protocol.\nTissue sample collection\nTiming: 2 days\nThis section describes the harvesting of tissue and collection of different lung pieces.\nWeigh mice.\nEuthanize mice with CO2.\nOptional: Use another anesthetic such as chloral hydrate, isoflurane, or Nembutal as approved by your Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee for humane euthanasia.\nDissect the lung tissue and rinse the tissue using a 50-mL syringe filled with ice-cold 1× PBS.\nCritical: Tissue harvesting should be completed relatively quickly.\nObserve and count the number of metastatic nodules under a stereomicroscope.\nRecord body weight, lung weight, and number of metastatic nodules for each mouse.",
    "Resect different lung lobes for downstream analysis.\nFor protein and RNA, store fresh tissue in liquid nitrogen.\nFor histochemistry, immerse a slightly larger piece of tissue in 10% formalin for 24 h and then place in 70% ethanol for 24 h before paraffin embedding.\nPerform paraffin embedding, slice tissue into 5-μm sections, and mount the sections on slides for subsequent histopathological assay.\nNote: It is important to cut the same lung lobe from the same area for each tissue sample.\nOptional: Collect other tissue such as the liver, spleen, or kidney if important for your experiment.\nHematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and analysis\nTiming: 3 days\nThis section describes the examination of morphological and structural pathological changes in lung tissue.\nPlace slides on a sectioning rack and bake in an oven at 60°C for 1 h to fully melt the paraffin wax.\nNote: The baking time should be sufficiently long to completely melt the paraffin, as incomplete melting of paraffin may lead to uneven coloring of the sections. However, the baking time should also not be too long, which may inactivate the antigens in the tissue and lead to false negative results.\nDip slides into three baths of xylene for 3 min each to deparaffinize the tissue.\nHydrate slides with 100% anhydrous ethanol, 95% ethanol, 80% ethanol, and 70% ethanol in sequence for 2 min each and wash in tap water for 5 min.\nNote: Reagents must be plated in the correct order when hydrating.\nTransfer the slides to hematoxylin for 5 min and terminate the staining with distilled water.\nWash off the excess hematoxylin with tap water for 2 min.\nDip the slides into 1% HCl five times and wash with tap water.\nDip the slides into water containing 1% ammonia five times and wash off with tap water.",
    "After the moisture is moderately removed by drying, transfer the slides to eosin for 1 min and then terminate the staining with distilled water.\nWash off the excess eosin with tap water for 2 min.\nTransfer the slides sequentially to 70%, 80%, 95%, and 100% ethanol for 2 min each.\nPlace the slides in two baths of xylene for 3 min each and let stand at 20°C–25°C.\nDrop a small amount of Permount on the tissue and cover with a coverslip.\nLeave to dry for at least 2 h before observation.\nNote: Slowly press down the coverslip from one side to avoid air bubbles.\nPhotograph under a bright field with 400× magnification.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2858-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Quantification of lung metastasis lesions using Qupath software\nDrag all data to Qupath or open the data through ‘File>Open’ (step 1). Annotate interesting regions using a selection tool such as ‘Wand’ (step 2). To lock the annotation, select it and then right-click to bring up the pop-up menu (step 3). Click the ‘Table’ button and select ‘Show annotation measurement’ to obtain the area of each annotation (step 4).\nData analysis:\nExport collected image fields and open a file in Qupath software.\nAnnotate the whole tissue region and metastatic regions using the ‘Wand’ tool (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], step 2).\nNote: To prevent accidental editing or loss, annotations can be locked or unlocked by right-clicking on a selected annotation.\nExport the areas of the annotated regions by selecting the ‘Table’ button in the toolbar.\nCalculate the percentage of metastatic lung fraction by dividing the sum of the area of metastatic regions by the area of the whole region.\nNote: Refer to Bankhead et al. (2017)3[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3] for detailed guidance in using Qupath software."
