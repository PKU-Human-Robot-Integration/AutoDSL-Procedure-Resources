    "All procedures described in this experiment were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at the Northern Sydney Local Health District, NSW, Australia (project number RESP17/55).\n1. Anesthesia and intubation\nNOTE: Turn on and set up the stereomicroscope, the heat pad (covered with an absorbant sheet) and ventilator system.\nClean gloves, the surgical area, and the tools with 70% ethanol.\nWeigh the mouse to calculate the dosage of anesthesia injected by the intraperitoneal route (ketamine 40 mg/kg, xylazine 5 mg/kg, atropine 0.15 mg/kg) and give the injection.\nOnce the mouse reaches a deep plane of anesthesia, shave the ventral left side of the thorax with a trimmer.\nPlace the mouse in a chamber containing 2% isoflurane (ensuring adequate extraction ventilation in the room).\n\tNOTE: The relatively low dose of ketamine/xylazine injection together with 2% isoflurane inhalation reduces the risk of mouse death while allowing optimal intubation without waking the mouse up.\nPlace the mouse supine and restrain it from its upper incisor teeth with a 3.0 suture taped to the bench, as shown in the video. Confirm sedation by performing a toe pinch. Position a high-intensity illuminator above the mouse neck so that the oropharynx can be visualized.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, the mouse can be placed on the stand from the intubation kit (e.g., Kent Mouse Intubation Kit) with an elastic band secured under the top incisors to hold the mouth open to identify the trachea.\nUse a curved spatula to open the jaw and another pair of spatulas/blunt forceps to lift the tongue gently out of the way. Be sure to intubate while positioned at or slightly below eye-level with the body of the mouse.\nVisualize the opening and closing of the vocal cords. When open, insert the 20 G plastic catheter supplied with the intubation kit.",
    "Carefully transfer the intubated mouse to an operating surface equipped with a heating pad. Connect the mouse to the ventilator (e.g., MouseVent) that automatically sets the target volume based on mouse weight.\nDeliver 1.5-2% isoflurane with oxygen (which is automatically regulated by the ventilator: ensure there is a connection from an oxygen cylinder to the automatic ventilator at 1-2 L/min flow rate to the ventilator). Verify the intubation by checking for bilateral chest rise. Verify anesthesia by performing a toe pinch.\nApply opthalmic ointment (e.g., Puralube Vet Opthalmic Ointment) to both eyes to prevent them from drying out.\n2. Preparing the surgical field\nSecure the intubation tube with tape at the connecting site between the ventilator and the breathing tube/catheter.\nCut a longer piece of tape and secure its left front foot to the operating surface in a slightly elevated position. Also tape down the other extremities.\nClean the chest with sterile 70% isopropanol and povidone iodine solution, cleaning in a circular motion moving from center to periphery.\nVerify anesthesia once more with a toe pinch.\nAdminister 0.08 mg/kg Temvet (buprenorphine) in 0.1 mL of 0.9% saline via subcutaneous injection.\n3. Left lateral thoracotomy\nUse fine-tip forceps to gently lift the skin at a point approximately 5 mm to the left of the prominent xiphoid cartilage. Use surgical scissors to create a superomedial incision in the skin from this point upwards and towards the midline, to the level of the manubrium.\nUse curved forceps to gently separate the skin and muscle layers. Open the muscle layer, following the skin incision.\nIdentify and make an incision in the third intercostal space, following the natural angle of the ribcage.\nUse a retractor to gently spread apart the 3rd and 4th ribs.\nGently remove the thin pericardium with forceps.",
    "If the LAD is not visualized, gently push the left auricle (see Supplementary Figure 1) upwards and locate the coronary arteries underneath.\n4. Left anterior descending (LAD) permanent coronary artery ligation\nCut a ~3 mm long 3-0 silk suture and put this reinforcing 3-0 silk suture piece on top of the LAD in the same direction as the LAD (as shown in the video at time point 02:12 – 02:20).\nIdentify the LAD and pass a 7-0 silk suture under the LAD. If the LAD is not clearly visualized, insert the needle 1 mm inferior and medial to the inferiormost point reached by the tip of the left auricle during dynamic movement of the heart.\n\tNOTE: This structure is a lighter color red to the ventricular chambers of the heart but darker than the adjacent lung and is best visualized in the video at time point 01:54 – 01:55 where it is visible just inferior to the superior arm of the retractor, superior to the left lung (see Supplementary Figure 1 for annotated video still image).\nComplete two throws with the 7-0 silk suture and close it tightly passing on top of the supportive 3-0 silk suture to secure the LAD. If the ligation is successful, the anterior ventricular area distal from the ligature will blanch.\nComplete the knot with a third throw in the opposite direction to secure it, ensuring no upward traction force is transmitted to the suture. Additional throws are not required to reduce the risk of damage to the myocardium or LAD by suture cutting through.\n5. Transplantation of the bioprinted patch onto the epicardium\nCarefully move the bioprinted patch from a six well plate to the infarct area by using the sterile inside surface of an opened surgical scalpel packet.",
    "Carefully position the bioprinted patch onto the anterior epicardial surface, where it should cover the whole surface and drape over the inferior and lateral edges, covering the left ventricle and the infarct zone (blanched area).\nGently close and remove the retractor without directing sharp edges towards the heart.\nUse 6-0 prolene sutures in a simple interrupted pattern to close the ribcage and the muscle layers.\nWith the Sigh Breath function while closing the chest with the 6-0 prolene sutures, inflate the lungs to remove excess air in the pleural cavity, which would otherwise become trapped in the chest cavity and result in a pneumothorax.\nEnsure that the chest is tightly sealed.\nDecrease the isoflurane to 1.0%. Close the skin with 6-0 prolene sutures in a simple interrupted pattern. Turn the isoflurane vaporizer off.\n6. Mouse recovery\nTopically apply 2 mg/mL bupivacaine in 0.9% saline to the incision. Administer also: i) Antisedan (atipamezole) 1 mg/kg; ii) Lasix (furosemide) 8 mg/kg; iii) 600 µL of 0.9% saline solution via a subcutaneous injection.\n\tNOTE: Antisedan is to reverse the anesthetic more rapidly; furosemide is to offload excess fluid due to cardiac output compromise and additional fluid administered with drug injections.\nMonitor the mouse and wait until independent breathing is observed to remove the mouse from the intubation tube.\nWhen the mouse demonstrates an adequate bilateral breathing rate and depth and responds to a toe pinch, place the mouse in a clean recovery cage placed on a heat pad.\nProvide the mouse with moist food (moistened for chewability), a water bottle and nutrient/hydrating gel. Monitor for an exaggerated breathing effort, excessive bleeding, or other potentially life-threatening complications.",
    "For the next three days, administer 0.08 mg/kg Temvet (buprenorphine) in 0.1 mL of 0.9% saline via subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection, twice daily, then once daily up to the fifth day following the procedure.\nHouse mice in pairs separated by cage dividers to prevent isolation whilst preventing fighting behaviors. Monitor mice at least daily until the end of the experiments (28 days) with close attention to their wellbeing and increased frequency of monitoring if there are any concerns."
