  "procedures": [
    "Unused segments of saphenous veins were obtained from patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery at the Heart Institute (InCor), University of São Paulo Medical School. All individuals gave informed consent to participate in the study, which was reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee.\n1. Isolation, culture, and characterization of primary human saphenous vein endothelial cells (hSVECs)\nPreparation\n\t\nAutoclave a pair of straight or curved forceps and tissue scissors (7-8 cm).\nPrepare sterile gelatin. Mix 0.1 g (0.1% w/v) or 3 g (3% w/v) of porcine skin gelatin with 100 mL of ultrapure water, autoclave for 15 min, and store at 4 °C. Warm to 37 °C to liquefy before coating the cell culture dishes and slides.\nPrepare sterile collagenase (1 mg/mL) inside the laminar flow hood. Dilute the collagenase in PBS and sterilize it with a 0.2 µm filter.\nCoat a 60 mm cell culture dish and an 8-well chamber slide with 0.1% w/v gelatin for at least 30 min at 37 °C. Remove the excess gelatin prior to seeding the cells.\nPrepare complete endothelial cell medium: endothelial cell growth basal medium (EBM-2) supplemented with EGM2 growth factors.\n\t\tNOTE: The EGM2 growth factors is supplied as a kit by a company listed in the Table of Materials. The concentration of the factors is not disclosed by the company.\nMake 2% and 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA), and 0.1% Triton X-100 solutions, all in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).\nIsolation and culture of hSVECs\n\t\nCollect at least a 2-3 cm long saphenous vein segment for this procedure.\n\t\tNOTE. All the cell culture procedures must be carried out under sterile conditions and inside a laminar flow hood.",
    "Transfer the vein segment to a Petri dish filled with pre-warmed PBS. Insert a pipette tip into one end of the vein and gently flush with PBS to remove all the blood inside the lumen. Flush it until the washing flow becomes completely clear.\nClose one of the ends of the vein with a sterile cotton suture. Carefully fill the vessel with 1 mg/mL collagenase type II solution. Close the other end of the vessel with a cotton suture (Figure 1A). Incubate the vessel with collagenase solution in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 1 h.\nAfter that, cut one of the ends of the vessel inside a 15 mL tube and collect the collagenase solution. Cut the other end and flush the luminal surface with 1-2 mL of PBS to collect all the detached ECs. Put all the PBS together with collagenase solution inside the same tube.\nCentrifuge the tube at 400 x g for 5 min at room temperature (RT) to pellet the cells.\n\t\t​NOTE. The cell pellet is very small and difficult to visualize. If the blood is not completely removed before collagenase treatment (step 1.2.2.), the blood cells will also precipitate, and the pellet will be reddish.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 3-4 mL of complete endothelial cell medium (EBM-2 supplemented with EGM2 growth factors) and an additional heparin solution (5 U/mL, final concentration). Plate the cells in a 60 mm cell culture dish pre-coated with 3% w/v gelatin.",
    "NOTE: Gelatin was the first choice due to its ease of accessibility and low cost. As the coating with gelatin successfully maintains the EC phenotype, no other coating substance was tested. Collagens and fibronectin can be tested in studies aiming to investigate the influence of different extracellular matrix components on EC adhesion and the phenotype.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 4 days without changing the medium. After that, change the media every other day. From this moment on, the additional cell media supplementation with heparin is no longer necessary. Examine the plate under the microscope to ensure that the red blood cells were removed.\nAfter 3-10 days post-extraction, depending on the size and diameter of the vein segment, visualize the hSVECs by phase-contrast microscopy.\nEvaluate the degree of confluence and their cobblestone morphology in phase-contrast microscopy.\nContinue changing the media every 2 days until the cells reach 70%-80% confluency.\nPassage the hSVECs with 0.25% trypsin-0.02% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution.\n\t\t\nWash the cells with pre-warmed PBS.\nAdd 1 mL of trypsin-EDTA solution to the 60 mm cell culture dish. Incubate at 37 °C for 2 min or until all the cells are detached.\nAdd 2 mL of complete endothelial cell medium to inactivate the trypsin.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL tube and centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min at RT.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of culture medium.\nCount the cell suspension in 1:1 trypan blue (0.4%) to plate viable cells.\nTo expand the culture, plate the cells in a 100 mm cell culture dish with 10 mL of pre-warmed complete endothelial cell medium and culture it at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2.",
    "NOTE. On average, the seeding of 4 x 104 hSVEC/cm2 will be 100% confluent after 48 h.\nTo cryopreserve the cells, resuspend the pellet from step 1.2.11.5 in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in fetal bovine serum (FBS) and store in liquid nitrogen.\nCharacterization of hSVECs: Flow cytometry staining for CD31\n\t\nTransfer 1 x 105 hSVECs to one 1.5 mL tube and centrifuge at 300 x g for 3 min at RT. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 100 µL of PBS containing 2% BSA and CD31-FITC monoclonal antibody (1:100).\nStain the cells for 30 min at RT in the dark.\nWash the stained cells by adding 0.5 mL of PBS and centrifuge them at 300 x g for 3 min at RT. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 400 µL of PBS with 2% BSA.\nUse unlabeled hSVECs, without CD31 antibody, as the negative control.\nProceed to flow cytometer acquisition analysis using a blue laser and FITC channel (excitation/emission max [Ex/Em] of 498/517 nm). If other fluorochromes are used, check whether the cytometer has appropriate filter sets for their detection. Separate the cells from debris in the function of their size and granularity, then gate single cells by forward scatter and side scatter.\nCharacterization of hSVECs: Fluorescent staining for CD31 and VE-cadherin\n\t\nPlate 0.1 x 105 cells in the gelatin-coated 8-well chamber slide. Incubate the cells overnight at 37 °C, 5 % CO2, to allow the cells to attach to the culture surface.\nRemove the medium and wash the cells once with PBS.\nAdd 0.3 mL/well of 4% PFA to fix the cells. Incubate for 15 min at RT.\nWash three times with PBS.\nAdd 0.3 mL/well of 0.1% Triton X-100 solution to permeabilize the cells. Incubate for 15 min at RT.",
    "Wash three times with PBS.\nTo block non-specific antibody binding sites, add 0.3 mL/well of 5% BSA solution to the cells. Incubate for 15 min at RT.\nWash three times with PBS.\nIncubate the cells with the primary antibodies (CD31 and VE-cadherin, 1:100) diluted in PBS with 2% BSA overnight with gentle rocking at 4 °C. Leave one well incubating with PBS with 2% BSA (no primary antibody) as the negative control.\nWash three times with PBS.\nIncubate the cells with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies diluted (1:500) in PBS for 1 h at RT. Add 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for nuclear staining to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL.\nWash three times with PBS.\nRemove the media chamber with the separator. Place one drop of the mounting medium reagent (50% glycerol in PBS) and place a glass slide (24 mm x 60 mm) while avoiding trapping bubbles.\nObserve the cells under a fluorescence microscope.\n\t\t​NOTE: DAPI is detected with a DAPI light cube (Ex: 335-379 nm; Em: 417-477 nm), and CD31/VE-cadherin is detected using a green fluorescent protein (GFP) light cube (Ex: 459-481 nm; Em: 500-550 nm). Light cubes with a similar excitation/emission wavelength range are also adequate for these fluorochromes. If other fluorochromes are used, check whether the microscope used has appropriate filter sets for their detection.\n2. Shear stress on hSVECs\nPreparation\n\t\nCoat the flow chamber slide with 0.1% w/v gelatin for at least 30 min at 37 °C. Remove excess gelatin prior to seeding the cells.\nEquilibrate the fluidic unit and sterile perfusion set with 10 mL reservoirs overnight inside the incubator in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C.\nShear stress experiment",
    "Seed 2 x 105 ECs suspended in 100 µL of EC medium into the gelatin-coated flow chamber slide. Incubate the cells for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 to allow the cells to attach to the culture surface.\nPlace the perfusion set on the fluidic unit as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Fill the reservoirs and the perfusion set in about 12 mL of pre-warmed complete endothelial cell medium. Remove manually air bubbles from the perfusion set to equilibrate the level of both reservoirs at 5 mL.\nPlace the fluidic unit with the mounted perfusion set, without the chamber slide, in the incubator and connect its electric cable to the computer-regulated pump. Remove all air bubbles from the reservoirs and perfusion set, running a predefined protocol in the pump control software.\n\t\tNOTE. It is very important to remove air bubbles for the system to function correctly.\nTake the fluidic unit with the mounted perfusion set to the laminar flow hood and attach the slides with a confluent cell monolayer.\nPlace the fluidic unit with the mounted perfusion and slides with cells in the incubator and connect its electric cable to the pump.\nIn the pump control software, set up the following parameters: viscosity of the medium (0.0072), type of slide, perfusion set calibration factor, shear stress rate (20 dyn/cm2), type of flow (unidirectional), and time (72 h), and start the flow (see the equipment instructions for further details). Harvest the cells treated with the same media without exposure to flow as static controls.\nAfter the stimulus is completed, wash the cells once with PBS and proceed to harvest the samples according to the required assay. For fluorescent staining, see step 2.3.1, and for RNA extraction, see step 2.3.2.\nDemonstration of the effectiveness of the shear stress protocol",
    "Fluorescent staining of actin filaments (F-actin)\n\t\t\nFix and permeabilize the cells as indicated in steps 1.4.2-1.4.6. Use a volume of 100 µL in the µ-slide.\nStain the F-actin with fluorescent-labeled phalloidin (diluted at 1:200 in PBS) and counterstain the nucleus with DAPI (final concentration of 1 mg/mL in PBS) for 2 h at RT, protected from light.\nWash three times with PBS.\nObserve the cells under a fluorescence microscope.\n\t\t\tNOTE: DAPI is detected with a DAPI light cube (Ex: 335-379 nm; Em: 417-477 nm) and phalloidin is detected with a GFP light cube (Ex: 459-481 nm; Em: 500-550 nm). Light cubes with a similar range of excitation/emission wavelength are also adequate for these fluorochromes. If other fluorochromes are used, check whether the microscope used has appropriate filter sets for their detection.\nGene expression by real-time quantitative reverse transcription (RT-qPCR)\n\t\t\nCollect the cells from the µ-slide with 350 µL of a commercial guanidine-thiocyanate-containing lysis buffer. Isolate the total RNA with column-based extraction kits, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Due to the limited number of cells cultured in the µ-slide, the use of column-based extraction of RNA is recommended.\nPrepare cDNA using a cDNA synthesis kit with transcriptase reverse enzyme, according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nVerify the expression of the gene(s) regulated by shear stress: KLF2, KLF4, and NOS3. Use the housekeeper gene PPIA/cyclophilin to normalize the results. The specific primers for the reaction are listed in Table 1.",
    "Perform RT-qPCR using an SYBR green fluorescent DNA stain kit under the following reaction conditions: i) 50 °C for 2 min, ii) 95 °C for 15 min, iii) 94 °C for 15 s, iv) 60 °C for 30 s, v) 72 °C for 30 s. Repeat steps iii through v for 40 cycles. Add a melting step at the end of the reaction to verify the primer's specificity.\n3. Cyclic stretch on hSVECs\nPreparation\n\t\nApply silicone-based lubricant to the tops and sides of the 6-well equibiaxial loading station of 25 mm.\n\t\tNOTE: This reduces friction between the culture plate membrane and the station, allowing better distribution of the cyclic strain. This step must be done before each experiment.\nCyclic stretch experiment\n\t\nSeed 4 x 105 cells suspended in 3 mL to each well of the 6-well flexible-bottomed culture plates coated with collagen I (Table of Materials). Plan to have a plate(s) in static condition as a control group. Keep the cells in the incubator (37 °C in humidified air with 5% CO2) until they reach 100% confluency (usually 48 h after seeding). Prior to the start of the stretch protocol, wash the cells once with pre-warmed PBS and add 3 mL of fresh culture medium per well.\nInsert the baseplate with all lubricated loading stations in the incubator and appropriately connect the tubing with the controller equipment of the tension cell stretching bioreactor system (see the equipment instructions for further details).\nAttach each culture plate to one red gasket, provided by the tension cell stretching bioreactor system. Then, put them into the baseplate inside the incubator.",
    "Make sure the plates are fully seated, pressed, and sealed to the baseplate to avoid air leaking during the vacuum pumping. It is important to have all four culture plates in the baseplate to have the proper vacuum and the stretching loading.\nIn case of having fewer experimental plates, use an empty one(s) to complete the four positions in the baseplate. Add the acrylic sheet (supplied with the equipment) on top of the culture plates to improve the baseplate sealing. Place the static plates in the same incubator.\nTurn on the controller equipment and the computer system. Open the software icon and configure the desired regimen: size of the loading station to be used, type of strain, percentage of elongation, waveform shape, frequency, and time. For detailed information, see the manufacturer's instructions. Select and download the regimen. Here, the following regimen was used: 1/2 sinus waveform shape, 1 Hz frequency, 5% of elongation (to mimic venous stretch), and 15% of elongation (to mimic arterial stretch) up to 72 h.\nTurn on the vacuum system and click on Start on the computer screen to run the stretching. Check if the silicone membrane is moving and stretching the cells.\nAfter the stimulus is completed, wash the cells once with PBS and proceed to harvest the samples according to the required assay. Here, to demonstrate the effectiveness of cyclic stretch, collect the hSVEC culture medium, keep it at -80 °C for further nitric oxide (NO) measurement, and fix the cells for fluorescent staining.\n\t\tNOTE. The baseplate cannot be stored inside the incubator when not in use; otherwise, the temperature can modify the flat shape and make it useless.\nDemonstration of the effectiveness of the cyclic stretch protocol\n\t\nFluorescent staining of F-actin",
    "Fix the cells as indicated in step 1.4.3. Use a volume of 1 mL per well.\nWash the cells three times with PBS. Maintain the cells in PBS so they do not dry while preparing the silicone membrane for the next steps.\nUse a cotton swab to remove the excess silicone-based lubricant from the bottom of the membrane. Then, gently apply window cleaner or hand soap with a new cotton swab. Repeat the process until all the lubricant is removed from the membrane. Then, clean with deionized water.\n\t\t\tNOTE. It is important to completely remove the lubricant from the silicone membrane to have microscopy images of good quality.\nCarefully cut the silicone membranes into small pieces to fit on 8-well chamber slides for staining. Permeabilize the cells as indicated in step 1.4.5.\nAfter the washing steps, stain the F-actin using phalloidin and the nucleus with DAPI. Proceed to the analysis, as indicated in steps 2.3.1.2 and 2.3.1.3. Use a volume of 0.3 mL per chamber well.\nRemove the media chamber with the separator. Place one drop of mounting medium reagent (50% glycerol in PBS) and place a glass slide (24 mm x 60 mm).\nObserve the cells under a fluorescence microscope.\n\t\t\tNOTE: DAPI is detected with a DAPI light cube (Ex: 335-379 nm; Em: 417-477 nm) and phalloidin is detected with a red fluorescent protein (RFP) light cube (Ex: 511-551 nm; Em: 573-613 nm). Light cubes with a similar range of excitation/emission wavelength are also adequate for these fluorochromes. If other fluorochromes are used, check whether the microscope used has appropriate filter sets for their detection.\nNO measurement-estimated by the nitrite (NO2) accumulation in the hSVEC conditioned medium using a potassium iodide-based reductive chemiluminescence assay\n\t\t\nPreparation",
    "Prepare a standard curve from 0.01-10 mM of sodium nitrite (NaNO2 in ultrapure water) solution.\nAdd 5 mL of acetic acid and 1 mL of potassium iodide (50 mg in 1 mL of ultrapure water) into the purge vessel of the nitric oxide analyzer.\nNO measurement\n\t\t\t\nAdd 20 µL of the NaNO2 standard curve into the purge vessel of the nitric oxide analyzer. Measure it according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nAdd 20 µL of the conditioned medium into the purge vessel of the nitric oxide analyzer. Measure it according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nCalculate the NO2 concentrations based on the standard curve calibration. Adjust the values obtained by the total volume of the conditioned medium analyzed6,11.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
