    "This protocol describes the thawing and expansion of one cryovial of an uncharacterized hiPSC clone in the range of p5-p10 to derive hiPSCs for an MCB. For details of general hiPSC culture, consult Frank, Zhang, Schöler, & Greber (2012[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-bib-0020]).\nMaterials\nSix-well plates or T75 flasks, coated with Geltrex (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-rec-0018])\nFTDA medium with and without Y-27632 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-rec-0010])\nWashing medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-rec-0017])\nReprogrammed, uncharacterized hiPSC clones, p5-p10\nY-27632 (rho kinase inhibitor) solution (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-rec-0018])\nDulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline (PBS; e.g., ThermoFisher 14190)\nAccutase solution with Y-27632 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-rec-0001])\nTrypan blue dye, optional\nWater bath, 37°C\nIncubator with CO2 and N2 gas supply with an O2 control system set to 37°C, 90% relative humidity (rH), 5% CO2, 5% O2 (hypoxic condition)\nWarming cabinet or other dry warming device, 37°C\nFreezers, −80°C and −150°C (or liquid nitrogen)\nDry ice\nSerological plastic pipets (e.g., Sarstedt 86.1685.001, 86.1254.001, and 86.1253.001)\n50- and 15-ml conical centrifugation tubes (e.g., Falcon®)\nCentrifuge\nNunclon® Delta Surface six-well plates and T75 flasks (ThermoFisher)\nCell counter (e.g., CASY cell counter) or Neubauer chamber\nThawing of hiPSCs\n1. Prewarm water bath and incubator (with Geltrex-coated plate inside). Prewarm washing medium and FTDA (both with Y-27632) in the warming cabinet.\n1 million frozen hiPSCs can be thawed on 9.6 cm² in 2 ml FTDA (one well of a six-well plate); adjust plating if necessary.\n2. Pick up frozen hiPSC cryovials stored in liquid nitrogen tank or −150°C freezer and transfer to the bench on dry ice. Thaw cryovial in water bath at 37°C for 2-3 min without shaking.\nThe water bath is prone to causing contamination, so vials should be sprayed with 70% ethanol or isopropanol after removal from the water bath.",
    "3. Draw up 5 ml washing medium in a pipet. Place the tip of the pipet into the cryovial, and gradually draw up the cell suspension into the washing medium inside the pipet. Slowly let cells and washing medium run down at the inner side of a 50-ml conical centrifugation tube. Centrifuge for 2 min at 200 × g, room temperature.\nThis will result in a gradual dilution of cells and cryoprotectant in medium, which decreases the osmotic shock for the hiPSCs.\n4. Aspirate supernatant, loosen cell pellet by tapping bottom of tube with finger, and resuspend carefully in FTDA medium with Y-27632. Aspirate Geltrex solution from the coated plates and plate cells.\nIf hiPSC clones were reprogrammed and frozen under different conditions, thaw them in the original medium and change condition gradually after thawing: e.g., change ratio every second day from 100% to 75%, 50%, and then 25%.\n5. Place the cells in an incubator under hypoxic condition at 37°C, 90% rH, 5% CO2 and 5% O2.\nDisperse cells equally by moving plate three times back and forth, three times side to side and let cells attach for at least 30 min before moving the plate again.\nFeeding of hiPSCs\n6. Monitor hiPSCs daily under the microscope.\nCheck attachment of the cells to the well or flask, confluency of cell layer, cell morphology, potential beginning of spontaneous differentiation (Fig. 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-fig-0002]), and color change of medium.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/0dd32762-2f63-449d-a94a-0e3352dd868c/cpsc127-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nMorphology of hiPSCs during culture.

(C, D) Examples of hiPSC cultures with islands of cells that have lost stem cell morphology (differentiated hiPSCs), delineated by dashed lines.\n7. Prepare aliquots of FTDA medium without Y-27632, and prewarm to 37°C.",
    "8. Aspirate most of the medium with one pipet for each cell line. Add 2-4 ml FTDA dropwise to each six-well plate.\nAdjust amount of FTDA to medium consumption indicated by the color (pH) of the medium. 90%-100% confluent cells (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-fig-0002]) benefit from feeding twice a day and should be passaged the next day.\n9. Return the cells into the incubator.\nPassaging\n10. Prewarm Geltrex-coated plate, PBS, Accutase with Y-27632, and FTDA with Y-27632 to 37°C.\n11. Aspirate medium, and wash with 1 ml PBS per 9.6 cm² (that is, per six-well plate).\n12. Detach cells with 1 ml Accutase with Y-27632 per 9.6 cm² for 5-10 min in the incubator.\nCheck cells frequently under the microscope for complete detachment.\n13. Wash off cells in 2 ml washing medium per 9.6 cm² and transfer to a 50-ml conical centrifugation tube.\nAll cells from different wells should be pooled and distributed into next passage.\n14. Centrifuge 2 min at 200 × g, room temperature. Aspirate supernatant, loosen cells by tapping bottom of conical centrifugation tube with finger, and resuspend carefully in 500 µl to 1 ml of FTDA with Y-27632.\n15. Count cells with CASY or manually with Neubauer chamber with Trypan Blue dye diluted 1:1 with cell suspension.\nProliferation (relation of harvested and seeded cells) and viability (percent of living cells) should be documented at every passage. Viability goal for expansion phase is viability >80%, with harvest density 2.5-3.5 × 105 per cm². For CASY counting, the aggregation factor (AGG) should be <2.1 according to settings for hiPSCs dissociated with Accutase from the manufacturer's instructions.\n16. Dilute cell suspension with FTDA with Y-27632. Aspirate Geltrex solution from the coated plates, and plate cells at a seeding density of 4.5-7 × 104 cells per cm² surface.",
    "Plate, e.g., 400,000-650,000 cells in 2 ml FTDA per 9.6 cm² (one six-well plate). Depending on seeding density, the next passaging will be necessary after 3-5 days.\n17. Incubate at 37°C, 90% rH, 5% CO2 and 5% O2, and document data.\nData documentation includes viability, aggregation factor, cell count, and morphology.\n18. Around p12-p15, scale up culture from six-well plates to T75 flasks.\nFeed with 15-30 ml FTDA depending on confluency (see steps 7 and 8), and use 7 ml Accutase to detach cells for transfer into the flask (see step 12).",
    "This section describes the freezing of a master cell bank (MCB) or working cell bank (WCB).\nMaterials\nTwo to four T75 flasks of confluent (90%-100%) hiPSCs at p18-p25 (Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-prot-0001])\nFetal bovine serum, advanced (FBS; Capricorn Scientific GmbH FBS-11A)\nAccutase solution with Y-27632 (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-rec-0001])\nWashing medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-rec-0017])\nFreezing medium (see recipe[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-rec-0008])\nPasteur pipets, sterile, autoclaved\nIncubator with CO2 and N2 gas supply with an O2 control system set to 37°C, 90% relative humidity (rH), 5% CO2, 5% O2 (hypoxic condition)\n50-ml conical centrifugation tube\nCryovials\nCryogenic storage labels or ethanol-resistant markers\nFreezing container with isopropanol or freezing machine\nFreezer, −80°C and −150°C (or liquid nitrogen tank)\nCryopreservation of MCB\nVolumes listed below are suitable for one T75 flask. For six-well plates, adjust according to growth surface. Two T75 will usually give rise to 25-30 cryovials containing 1 million hiPSCs each.\n1. Image cell morphology just before harvesting for MCB, and document.\n2. Aspirate medium using a sterile, autoclaved Pasteur pipet for each cell line. Wash with 10 ml PBS per T75 flask.\n3. Add 7 ml of Accutase with Y-27632 and incubate 7-10 min in incubator.\nIncubate until cells detach completely, with no scraping or tapping.\n4. Resuspend cells in 10 ml washing medium. Centrifuge cells in 50-ml conical centrifugation tube for 3 min at 200 × g, room temperature.\n5. Aspirate supernatant, loosen the pellet by tapping bottom of conical centrifugation tube, and carefully resuspend in 2-3 ml FBS.\n6. Count cells in CASY or manually with Neubauer chamber.\nCell count goals: AGG <2.1, viability for freezing >90%, harvest density a bit lower than for passaging, between 1.5 and 2.0 × 105 per cm2, to assure exponential growth phase. Aliquot sample for pluripotency marker test on fresh cells.",
    "The fresh cell population just before the freezing should be examined, as the expression of surface markers might alter during freeze-thaw (see Anticipated Results).\n7. Calculate the amount of freezing medium required to give a final concentration of 1 million cells per 1 ml of freezing medium.\n8. Prepare fresh freezing medium (10% DMSO/90% FBS) in an extra tube in advance.\nCalculate FBS amount including the amount used for pre-suspension in the step 5, so that the final concentration of DMSO will be 10%. Add 10% extra for pipetting volume.\n9. Add freezing medium to the cells. Invert and pipet very gentle, and aliquot immediately into labeled cryovials.\nConsider using printed labels. The full cell line name with clone number, passage number, MCB/WCB, and freezing date should appear.\n10. Transfer MCB vials in the freezing container to a −80°C freezer and let it sit overnight. The next day, transfer to −150°C or liquid nitrogen.\nThe freezing container allows gradual freezing at −1°C per minute in the −80°C freezer for the first 24 hr. Avoid moving of the container in the freezer during the freezing procedure. A controlled-rate freezing machine can be used as an alternative.\n11. Document all the data in a file, and prepare detailed information in the storage list.\nRedundancy of information is helpful for detecting mistakes, e.g., with numbering.\nCryopreservation of WCB\n12. Thaw 1 vial of the MCB, expand further for 3-5 passages, and cryopreserve as WCB by repeating steps 1-11 and quality controls as specified in Figure 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-fig-0003] (see Support Protocols 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-prot-0003]-4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-prot-0006]) .\nQuality controls include proof of pluripotency, potency, sterility, viability, transgene clearance, and genetic stability (Fig. 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-fig-0003]).

    "3. On the viability control plate, plate into each well 2 ml from each MCB cryovial.\n4. On the sterility control plate, pool the remaining 300 µl from both vials and add 1 ml FTDA with Y-27632.\nViability control\n5. Document recovery by photographing the cell density of the viability control plate.\nDependent on their confluency after thawing, it may be desirable to plate the hiPSCs into a larger number of wells in future, or MCB production might need to be repeated (Fig. 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-fig-0004]).\n6. Feed hiPSCs daily, and consider subjecting them to further analysis (Support Protocols 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-prot-0005] and 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-prot-0006].\nControl for bacterial and fungal contamination including mycoplasma\n7. Check regularly for bacterial contamination for 10 days, without changing the medium, by monitoring medium color and potential bacterial motion under the microscope at high magnification, as well as the growth speed and morphology of hiPSCs.\nUsually bacterial contaminants are fast growing and clearly visible after 2-3 days, but slowly growing bacteria (e.g., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia or Burkholderia cepacia) can take 10 days to become apparent. We generally do not recommend using antibiotics in hiPSC cultures.\n8. Optional: Send supernatant for sterility check.\nHospital hygiene departments provide standardized tests and insight into the types of bacterial contamination that can help avoid recurring heavy infections.\n9. After 72 hr, sample medium supernatant for detection of mycoplasma by PCR as described by Breckwoldt et al. (2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-bib-0010]) or using an alternative commercially available mycoplasma detection test.\nTesting for potential mycoplasma contamination is also highly recommended after thawing young clones and during expansion. Sample medium supernatant of fully confluent hiPSCs to assure that the detection threshold is reached.",
    "The specificity and sensitivity of mycoplasma tests varies and should be validated (Nikfarjam et al., 2012). The sterility test specified in this protocol assures that cell cultures are in general aseptic. However, this does not assure sterility (Fleming et al., 2006).",

The potency of hiPSCs in regard to differentiation into the three germ layers is examined by qRT-PCR (see Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-tbl-0001]; Bertero et al., 2016[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-bib-0009]; Breckwoldt et al., 2017[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-bib-0010]; Schaaf et al., 2014[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-bib-0040]).

Transfer 3 ml of cell suspension to a T25 flask previously coated with Pluronic® F127 and washed.\n9. Transfer the remaining cell suspension into a 1.5-ml tube as the day 0 sample. Remove supernatant after a short centrifugation, snap-freeze cell pellet in liquid nitrogen, and store at −80°C.\n10. Incubate T25 flask at 37°C, 90% rH, 5% CO2 under normoxic conditions. Cell aggregation will give rise to embryoid bodies overnight (Fig. 5B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-fig-0005]).\n11.

Let this sediment, and remove supernatant so that only about 1 ml of medium with EBs is left. Transfer to a labeled 1.5-ml tube. Centrifuge 1 min at 300 × g, room temperature. Remove supernatant, snap freeze cell pellet in liquid nitrogen, and store at −80°C.\nRT-qPCR for germ layer markers, viral clearance, and stem cell markers\n13. Isolate RNA and transcribe into cDNA.\nUse, for example, the RNeasy Plus Mini Kit and High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription according to manufacturer's instructions. Measure RNA concentration and purity with a Nanodrop spectrophotometer.\n14. Run RT-qPCR with primers for markers of each germ layer, for endogenous pluripotency genes (as listed in Table 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpsc.127#cpsc127-tbl-0001]), and for reprogramming virus primers according to manufacturer's instructions.",
    "Include negative controls without addition of reverse transcriptase to detect potential genomic artifacts. Also include as positive controls samples from differentiated cells, hiPSC and transduced fibroblasts.\n15. Normalize expression to household gene and evaluate expression of differentiated cells as fold of hiPSCs (day 0).\nAt least one marker of all three germ layers should be upregulated, and markers of stem cell and self-renewal should be downregulated, on day 7 as compared with day 0. Sendai virus should be detectable only in transduced fibroblasts.\nClones should be transgene free before functional experiments are conducted. If quality controls need to take place in a laboratory with biosafety level 1 (BSL1), it may be useful to verify viral clearance during expansion, as transgene clearance verification is a prerequisite for the use of S1.",
