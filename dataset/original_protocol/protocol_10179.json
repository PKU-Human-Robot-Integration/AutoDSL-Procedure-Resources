    "1. Fabrication of the Microfluidic Device Mold\nDesign the pattern of the microfluidic device using commercially available software (Clewin5 or AutoCAD 2016, etc.). For the function of the Clewin5, see the user manual (http://manualzz.com/doc/7159150/clewin-user-s-manual).\n\tNOTE: The design file is available in Supplementary File 1.\nTransfer the design file to a micro pattern generator and load the tool with a chromium mask coated with the positive photoresist.\nExpose the positive photoresist in the pattern area using a micro pattern generator.\nDevelop the positive photoresist using the developer (Table of Materials) and rinse the mask with deionized (DI) water.\nUsing the chromium etchant (Table of Materials), etch the chromium in the exposed area where the positive photoresist was removed. Rinse the mask with DI water.\nRemove the remaining the photoresist on the mask using acetone.\n\tNOTE: Transparency mask can be an alternative for the Cr mask.\nPrepare a clean silicon wafer (4 inch, P(100)) and spin coat hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS) at 3,000 rpm for 30 s.\nSoftbake HMDS for 5 min at 120 °C and cool the wafer for 5 min at room temperature.\nSpincoat the negative photoresist (Table of Materials) at 500 rpm for 10 s and 1,200 rpm for 30 s.\n\tNOTE: The spin coating condition should yield the photoresist layers with a thickness of approximately 100 µm on the wafers after photolithography.\nPrebake the negative photoresist for 45 min at 95 °C and cool the wafer for 60 min at room temperature.\nCheck the UV light intensity in each experiment and calculate the exposure time for a total exposure energy dose at 250 mW/cm2. Place the photomask (step 1.1-1.6) on the wafer and expose them to the UV light.",
    "Postbake the negative photoresist for 1 min at 65 °C and 5 min at 95 °C. Allow the wafer to cool down for 1 min at room temperature.\nDevelop the negative photoresist layer for 15 min in the first developer (Table of Materials) bath and 2 min in the second bath. Rinse the wafer in the first isopropanol (IPA) bath for 10 s and in the second IPA bath for 10 s.\nHardbake the negative photoresist for 30 min at 200 °C and cool the wafer for 5 min at room temperature.\nMeasure the thickness of the negative photoresist layer using a surface profiler.\nPlace the wafer in a desiccator connected to a vacuum pump and add 200 µL of silane (trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane). Turn on the pump for 10 min, then turn it off and keep the wafer in the desiccator for 4 h.\n2. Fabrication Steps and the Assembly of PDMS Layers\nCast the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) pre-polymer (PDMS base: curing agent = 10:1 (w/w)) and degas in a vacuum chamber for 2 h.\nCure PDMS at 80°C in an air-vented oven overnight.\nPeel off the PDMS from the silicon wafer.\nPunch the holes 1A - 3B (Figure 1) and the spheroid culture well. Use a 2-mm diameter punch for holes 1A - 3B, and a 1-mm diameter punch for the spheroid well.\nClean the PDMS slab and a glass cover slip (24 mm × 24 mm) with adhesive tape, by repeatedly sticking and peeling off the tape. Then treat the PDMS slab with air plasma for 40 s (40 mW, 50 sccm).\nBond the PDMS slab onto the glass cover slip to expel any air bubbles from the surface between the PDMS slab and the cover slip and cure at 80 °C for at least 12 h.\n3. Spheroid Preparation",
    "NOTE: In the study, red fluorescent protein expressing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (RFP-HUVECs) and green fluorescent protein expressing HUVECs (GFP-HUVECs) are used in the spheroid and microchannels, respectively, to distinguish the origin of HUVECs after the construction of a perfusable vascular network. If the origin of HUVECs is not needed, unlabeled HUVECs are enough for the experiment.\nThaw the RFP-HUVECs (3.0 × 105 cells/vial) and human lung fibroblast (hLF) (1.0 × 106 cells/vial) and add them into 10 mL of medium for endothelial cells and fibroblast cells, respectively (Table of Materials). Culture them in a 100-mm dish at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2-3 days for sub-confluent RFP-HUVECs and hLFs. This preparation will yield ~200 spheroids.\nDetach the RFP-HUVECs and hLFs from the dishes with 2 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and stop the trypsin reaction with 4 mL of DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin.\nAfter centrifugation at 220 x g for 3 min, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the RFP-HUVECs and hLFs in the endothelial medium to final cell concentrations at 2.5 × 104 and 1.0 × 105 cells/mL, respectively.\nGently add 200 µL of the cell suspension (5,000 cells for RFP-HUVECs and 20,000 cells for hLFs) per well in a 96-well plate with ultra-low binding surface.\nIncubate the 96-well plate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for a period of 2-4 days.\n\tNOTE: Since the spheroid diameter depends on the culture period and initial cell number in the 96-well plate, it can be controlled by these two parameters.\n4. Cell Seeding in the Microfluidic Device",
    "Note: The naming convention for the holes, channels and the spheroid well are demonstrated in Figure 1. We define day 0 as the day when cell harvesting into the microfluidic device is finished. Schematic of the experimental timelines is shown in Figure 2.\nDay −1) Spheroid loading\n\tNOTE: The following step should be performed on ice to prevent gelation of collagen and fibrin.\n\t\nDissolve fibrinogen in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for a final concentration of 2.80 mg/mL.\nPrepare neutralized collagen (3.0 mg/mL in PBS) according to the manufacturer's protocol.\nCombine 107.2 µL of fibrinogen solution (2.80 mg/mL), 8.0 µL of neutralized collagen (3.0 mg/mL), and 3.6 µL of aprotinin (5 U/mL) per reaction in a tube. This solution is labelled \"master mix solution\" (MS).\n\t\tNOTE: The volume is enough for loading one spheroid. If there is more than one spheroid, multiply each volume by the number of spheroids.\nDissolve thrombin in PBS for a final concentration of 50 U/mL.\n\t\tNOTE: Aliquots of 50 U/mL thrombin (20 µL/tube) are stored at −30 °C and are thawed before each experiment.\nPlace the 96-well plate containing the spheroids inside the biosafety cabinet.\nPrepare two 35-mm Petri dishes inside the biosafety cabinet, with one dish on ice (dish 1) and the other dish on the benchtop (dish 2). Pipet 99 µL of MS at the center of dish 1 (Figure 3a) to form a droplet.",
    "Trim the tips of 2 yellow (10-100 µL) and 3 clear pipette tips (1-100 µL) for the collection of spheroids from the 96-well plate, mixing thrombin with MS, precise collection of the spheroids, injecting the spheroids into the device, and injecting media into the device, respectively. The pore size of the tip should be slightly larger than the diameter of holes 1A - 3B of channels 1 and 3 or the spheroid well in channel 2 for a snug fit.\n\t\tNOTE: Hereafter, unless otherwise noted, use the pipette tips cut in this step. The photograph of cut tips is available in Figure 4.\nCollect a spheroid with 100 µL of medium from the 96-well plate and add it to dish 2 (Figure 3a).\nPick up the spheroid with minimum volume of media from dish 2. While holding the pipettor upright, the spheroid should move towards the bottom of the pipet tip by gravity. Eject the spheroid by touching the pipet tip onto the meniscus of the MS droplet in dish 1 (Figure 3a).\n\t\tNOTE: The following steps 4.1.10 & 4.1.11 should be performed quickly.\nAdd 1 µL of thrombin (50 U/mL) and mix gently with the yellow pipet tip.\nWith the pipette set to 7 µL, pick up the spheroid and slowly place it into the spheroid well (Figure 3b).\nIncubate for 15 min at 37 °C for the gelation of fibrin.\nSlowly inject the endothelial medium from holes 1A and 3A and fill channels 1 and 3 with media (20~30 µL/channel).\nPlace the device in a 100-mm dish with a wet Kimwipe to prevent evaporation of media from the device (Figure 3c).\nPlace the device at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 24 h to remove the bubbles at the interface between the media and fibrin.",
    "Day 0) HUVECs loading\n\t\nThaw GFP-HUVECs (3.0 x 105 cells/vial) and add them to 10 mL of the endothelial medium. Culture them in a 100-mm dish at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2-3 days to reach sub-confluency. One dish of sub-confluent GFP-HUVECs is enough for preparing 8-10 devices.\nDetach GFP-HUVECs from the dishes with 2 mL of 0.05% trypsin-EDTA and stop the trypsin reaction with 4 mL of DMEM containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin.\nAfter centrifugation at 220 x g for 3 min, resuspend the GFP-HUVECs in the endothelial medium at 5.0 x 106 cells/mL.\nInject HUVECs cell suspension into channel 1 through hole 1B (20 µL/channel).\nTilt the microfluidic device 90°, place it on the side and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min to ensure that the HUVECs adhere to the fibrin in channel 2.\n\t\t\nConfirm the attachment of HUVECs on the fibrin. When the number of HUVECs attached at the interface between the gel and medium is not sufficient, the vasculature may be disconnected at the vascular root after a few days of device culture (Figure 5). In the protocol, the success rate of the perfusion is >50%.\nRepeat steps 4.2.4 and 4.2.5 for channel 3.\nCulture cells in a 100-mm dish with a damp Kimwipe at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 7-14 days.\nDay 1~) Media exchange\n\t\nExchange half of the media in channels 1 and 3 every day.\n5. Nuclei Staining\nPrepare 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS.\nRemove the media from channels 1 and 3 and add 20 µL of 4% PFA per channel. To replace the solution in 4% PFA, repeat removing the solution from the device and adding 4% PFA three times.\nIncubate the device at 4 °C overnight.",
    "Remove 4% PFA from the device and wash the channels three times with PBS.\nAdd 20 µL of 10 µg/mL the fluorescent dye (Table of Materials) per channel to stain cellular nuclei. To exchange the solution in the device, repeat removing the solution from the device and adding 10 µg/mL the fluorescent dye three times.\nStore the device at 4 °C for 24 h.\n6. Fluid Perfusion of a Spheroid\nPrepare the spheroid after culturing for more than 7 days in the device at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for the completion of a continuous vascular pathway.\nRemove the medium from holes 1A, 1B, 3A and 3B.\nIntroduce 10 µL of 10 µM solution of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran in PBS into holes 1A and 1B.\nMonitor the flow of microbeads or FITC dye under an inverted microscope.\n7. Quantification of Sprout Length\nNOTE: ImageJ ver. 1.49 software is used for all of analysis of the image in this study.\nOverlap the images of GFP-HUVECs days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7.\nSubtract the position of the vasculature tip of day 0 from the same position at images taken on days 1, 3, 5 and 7.\nDetermine the growth of the vascular tip from the root position (Figure 6). The distance between the vascular tip and root was defined as the sprout length in this study (Figure 7b).\n8. Quantification of Vascular Angles\nNOTE: Vascular angle was defined as the angle consisted by vascular angle, root and the center of the spheroid (Figure 7c).\nBinarize the fluorescent images of the coculture spheroid containing RFP-HUVECs and measure \"centroid\" position by analysis function in ImageJ. In this study, the measured \"centroid\" position is defined as the center of the spheroid (Figure 6).",
