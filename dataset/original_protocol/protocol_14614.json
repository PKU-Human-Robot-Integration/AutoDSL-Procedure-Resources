    "All animal studies were conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Canadian Council on Animal Care, under protocols approved by the Western University Animal Use Subcommittee.\n1. Organ Isolation (Lung, Brain, Bone, Lymph Node)\nPrepare four sterile 50 ml conical tubes (one for each organ to be isolated) containing approximately 30 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Pre-weigh each tube of PBS using an electronic balance.\nEuthanize 6-12 week old mouse by CO2 inhalation. Mice should be left in the CO2 chamber for approximately 1 - 2 min or until the mouse stops moving and breathing. Successful euthanasia can be further confirmed by a lack of heartbeat when checked manually with a finger. Avoid cervical dislocation as this method may rupture blood vessels of the neck leading to difficulty removing axillary lymph nodes.\n\tNote: Previous work has specifically used healthy female nude mice, Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn1nu13.\nIn a sterile tissue culture hood, place the mouse on its back on a polystyrene foam pad, spread the limbs and use pins to keep them in place.\nUsing sterile forceps and scissors, cut the abdominal skin at the midline at the genitalia and cut upwards toward the mouth. Gently pull back the abdominal skin from the abdominal muscles and pin in place on the polystyrene foam pad.\nLocate the axillary, brachial, and inguinal lymph nodes.\n\tNote: Lymph nodes are usually surrounded by fatty tissue. The inguinal lymph nodes are the easiest to locate as they are found superficially at the junction of two blood vessels on the pulled back abdominal skin. Axillary and brachial lymph nodes are located deeper within the tissue and require gentle maneuvering of tissue.",
    "After you have located the lymph nodes, use the scissors to gently and carefully cut the lymph nodes away from the skin, fat and vessels and remove them from the mouse. To confirm proper dissection, roll the forceps over the removed tissue. If a hard lump exists when rolling the forceps over the tissue, then a lymph node has likely been removed successfully.\nPlace removed lymph nodes in ice cold PBS.\nUsing the forceps and scissors, open the abdominal cavity by cutting through the exposed abdominal wall in an upward motion towards the chest. Carefully cut through the sternum, exposing the thoracic cavity.\nLocate the diaphragm below the lungs and cut the diaphragm. It should pull towards the ribs due to tension.\nLift the lungs from underneath and cut the underlying tissue towards the trachea. This allows the lungs to be removed freely from the thoracic cavity. Remove the heart and lungs en bloc and place in ice cold PBS. The heart can be removed from the lungs here or just before weighing in Step 2.\nRemove the pins, keeping the mouse in place on the polystyrene foam pad. Turn the mouse over and cut the skin of the lower back all the way across from flank to flank.\nUsing a sterile piece of gauze to hold the torso of the mouse, peel the back skin of the mouse over the legs and feet of the mouse.\nUsing the same piece of sterile gauze, hold the lower leg in place, carefully break the ankle joint of the mouse foot and peel the skin over the joint proximally towards the knee joint.\nUsing scissors, remove the tibia free from the knee joint and place in ice cold PBS.\nRepeat steps 1.11) to 1.12) with opposite limb.",
    "Using forceps, hold the femur in place, cut away surrounding muscle tissue using the scissors and remove the femur, placing it in ice cold PBS.\nRepeat step 1.14) with opposite limb.\nUsing a new piece of sterile gauze, hold the head of the mouse in place. Using forceps and scissors, gently remove the skin to expose the skull. Using scissors, carefully cut the occipital skull from the top center in a straight and downward line to expose the posterior brain.\nUsing forceps, scoop underneath the brain towards the anterior and remove the whole brain. Place the brain in ice cold PBS.\nRepeat steps 1.1) to 1.17) for at least four mice.\n2. Organ Weighing\nFollowing organ isolation, weigh each PBS tube containing lung and brain tissue using an electronic balance.\nCalculate the weight difference by subtracting the pre-isolation weight (PBS only) from the weight of the PBS tube + organs (lung and brain).\nDetermine the amount of media needed to resuspend tissue fragments from the calculated weight difference.\n\tNote: Lung and brain tissue are weight normalized by resuspension in a 4:1 media:tissue ratio (vol/wt).\n3. Generation of Lung- and Brain- Conditioned Media\nIn a sterile tissue culture hood, invert PBS tubes containing lung or brain three times to remove residual blood from organs and aspirate PBS containing blood. Repeat with fresh cold PBS until solution appears clear with no evidence of blood.\nPlace lungs and brains in separate 60 mm2 glass petri dishes. Using two sterile scalpel blades, mince lungs or brains by repeatedly slicing back and forth until tissue fragments are approximately ~ 1 mm3 in size.\nResuspend tissue fragments in appropriate volume (determined previously in step 2.3) of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM):F12 media supplemented with 1x concentrated mitogen supplement and penicillin (50 µg/ml)/streptomycin (50 µg/ml).",
    "Add resuspended lung or brain tissue fragments to one well of a 6-well plate.\nIncubate tissue fragments in media for 24 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Following incubation, collect conditioned media for each tissue and further dilute by adding three equivalent volumes of fresh media in a 50 ml conical tube.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 x g in diluted conditioned media for each organ at 4 °C for 15 min to remove large tissue debris. Collect media supernatant and filter through a 0.22 µm syringe filter.\nPool conditioned media from each organ (i.e., lung with lung and brain with brain) from multiple mice to account for mouse-to-mouse variability. Aliquot and store conditioned media at -80 °C until use.\n4. Generation of Bone Marrow-conditioned Media\nIn a sterile tissue culture hood, trim excess tissue from the bone and remove epiphyses (end pieces) from the bones with scissors.\nUsing a 27 ½ G needle, flush medullary cavity of bones by pushing 1 ml of PBS through the center of each bone. This will allow you to collect bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC)into a fresh tube containing PBS.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and wash BMSC twice with PBS. Resuspend bone marrow stromal cells in 20 ml of bone stromal cell growth media (DMEM:F12 media supplemented with 1x concentrated mitogen supplement, penicillin (50 µg/ml)/streptomycin (50 µg/ml) and 10% fetal boven serum (FBS)).\nPlate 10 ml of resuspended bone marrow stromal cells in one T75 flask.\n\tNote: Combine and plate cells from every 2 mice in each T75 flask; for four mice, two T75 flasks are needed (approximately 1 x 107 cells/flask).",
    "Incubate bone marrow stromal cells in bone stromal cell growth media for 24 hr at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Following incubation, remove media from both T75 flasks and put into new T75 flask, label this flask as \"Floater Flask\". Add fresh bone stromal cell growth media to previous 2 flasks and incubate all 3 flasks at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nAfter cells reach approximately 70% confluency (approximately 5 - 7 days) passage cells. To do this, remove medium and wash cells twice with PBS (3 ml each wash). Remove PBS and add 3 ml of trypsin/EDTA solution, ensuring that trypsin covers the entire surface of the flask. After cells lift off the flask (~ 2 - 3 min), stop trypsinization reaction by adding 3 ml bone stromal cell growth media). Centrifuge 900 x g for 5 min at 4 °C, discard media, and resuspend cells in 10 ml of fresh bone stromal cell growth media.\nPool cells from all flasks and passage 1:5 into three new T75 flasks and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2. After cells once again reach 70%, repeat step 4.6 and pool and passage all adherent cells a second time. Re-plate all cells to four T75 flasks and incubate 37 °C and 5% CO2. Bone stromal cell growth media should be used for all steps.\nAllow cells to reach confluence, wash cells three times with PBS and add bone stromal cell collection media (DMEM:F12 media + 1x concentrated mitogen supplement + penicillin (50 µg/ml)/streptomycin (50 µg/ml); 10 ml/T75), making sure that this media is free of FBS. Collect bone marrow-conditioned media 72 hr later, filter through a 0.22 µm filter, pool, aliquot, and store at -80 °C until use.",
    "If desired, confirm the phenotype of the isolated bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) using antibodies against mouse Sca-1, CD105, CD29, and CD73, CD44, using standard flow cytometry techniques as described previously13.\n5. Generation of Lymph Node-conditioned Media\nIn a sterile tissue culture hood, invert PBS tube containing lymph nodes three times to remove residual blood from lymph nodes and aspirate bloody PBS. Repeat with fresh cold PBS until solution appears clear with no evidence of blood.\nPlace lymph nodes in 60 mm2 glass petri dishes. Using two sterile scalpel blades, mince lymph nodes by repeatedly slicing back and forth until tissue fragments are approximately 1 mm3 in size.\nIn a conical tube, resuspend tissue fragments in 10 ml of Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 (RPMI1640) media supplemented with penicillin (50 µg/ml)/streptomycin (50 µg/ml), 5 x 10-5 M sterile β-mercaptoethanol (1.75 µl/500 ml media) and 10% FBS.\nCentrifuge at 900 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspend all cells in 30 ml media. Add 5 ml media/well in a 6-well plate and incubate for 7 days at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nFollowing the 7 day incubation, discard media, wash adherent cells with 5 ml warm PBS and add 5 ml fresh media to each well. Allow cells to grow to confluency (approximately 5 - 7 days), trypsinize, pool all cells, and passage as described in step 4.6. Re-plate cells to 6-well plate. Repeat this step three times.\nAfter three passages, allow cells to grow to confluency, wash wells three times with PBS and add 2 ml/well of DMEM:F12 + 1x concentrated mitogen supplement and penicillin (50 µg /ml)/streptomycin (50 µg/ml), ensuring that this media is free of FBS. Collect lymph node-conditioned media after 72 hr, pool, aliquot, and store at -80 °C until use.",
    "If desired, confirm the phenotype of the isolated lymph node stromal cells (LNSC) using antibodies against mouse CD45 and gp38, using standard flow cytometry techniques as described previously13.\n6. Use of Organ-conditioned Media for Downstream Assays Related to Metastatic Behavior of Cancer Cells\nOnce the organ-conditioned media has been generated as described in steps 1 - 5, use it to carry out different downstream cell and molecular biology assays in order to determine the influence of soluble organ-derived factors on the metastatic behavior of cancer cells. Examples of standard assays (described elsewhere in the literature) include protein arrays13, cellular growth assays13, cellular migration assays13, tumorsphere formation14, and RT-PCR15. The original base media used to generate the organ-conditioned media (i.e., unconditioned DMEM:F12 media supplemented with 1x concentrated mitogen supplement and penicillin (50 µg/ml)/streptomycin (50 µg/ml) should be used as a negative control.\nSubscription Required.
