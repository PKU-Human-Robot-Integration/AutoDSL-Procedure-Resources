Then add 15 g of urea and mix until dissolved (store at 4 °C in the dark).\nPrepare PBT (PBS with Tween-20) buffer. This buffer contains PBS/Tween-20 (0.1% v/v). For 1 L of PBS, add 1 mL of Tween-20.\n3. Preparation of small molecules",
    "Reconstitute thiazovivin (ROCK inhibitor) powder in 10 mM aliquots of 50 µL in DMSO and store at -20 °C for up to 6 months. Protect from light.\nPrepare 2.5 mM aliquots of 10 µL each of Cal-520 AM in DMSO and store them at -20 °C for up to 6 months. Protect from light.\n4. Cardiac spheroid generation\nNOTE: For larger amounts of CSs, seed up to 1 million CMs in a 6-well ultra-low attachment plate with 2 mL of hiPSC-CM re-plating media. This study used a minimum of 2,500 (2.5k CS) up to 20,000 (20k CS) hiPSC-CMs per well of a 96-well plate.\nFor one 96-well plate, prepare a cell culture containing a minimum of 2 x 106 human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs)10.\nWhen the cultured hiPSC-CMs reach confluence, add 0.1 mL/cm2 of sterile cardiac detachment solution (e.g., tryple) to each well. Incubate the plate at 37 °C for 15 min.\nUsing a 5 mL pipet, mechanically dissociate the cells by flushing with 2 mL of warm basal medium to make a single cell suspension. Confirm the detachment with a bright field microscope (4x magnification); cells will look white and have a round shape.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a 15 mL conical tube and centrifuge for 3 min at 300 x g.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 1 mL of hiPSC-CM re-plating media.\nUsing a 1,000 µL pipet tip, mechanically dissociate the cell pellet. The solution appears homogeneous after three or four mixes. Count the cells. Transfer the appropriate amount of cells in 100 µL of the re-plating medium to each ultra-low attachment round-bottom 96-well well.",
    "Place the plate of CSs on an orbital shaker at 70 rpm in the incubator for 24 h. Set the incubator conditions to 37 °C, 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 90% humidity.\nAspirate 50 µL of medium from each well and add 100 µL of RPMI + B27 medium per well for the first 48 h.\n\tNOTE: Always keep 50 µL of the medium in the 96-well plate to avoid accidental aspiration and spheroid rupture.\nAspirate 100 µL of the medium from each well and add 100 µL of the maturation medium per well. Maintain the cells in the maturation medium and refresh the medium every 2-3 days.\n5. Cryopreservation of CSs\nNOTE: CSs can be cryopreserved for long-term storage. Cryopreservation can be performed from day 3 after the generation of CSs. CSs can be cryopreserved directly in the wells of a 96-well plate or as a CS suspension in cryovials.\nPre-cool the plate by placing the plate on ice for 10 min.\nCentrifuge the spheroid plate for 3 min at 70 x g.\nRemove the supernatant till 50 µL remains and add 200 µL of ice-cold hiPSC freezing medium per well.\n\tNOTE: Keep the CS suspension on ice for the entire duration of the procedure. In the case of a 6-well plate with spheroids, freeze one well in a 500 µL freezing medium cryovial.\nSeal the plate with plate sealing film.\n\tNOTE: The 96-well plate needs to be stored in a polystyrene box or, when not available, a silicon mold can be made as described in step 5.5.1.\nTo ensure uniform heat exchange between the well plate and the freezer, place the plate carefully into a polystyrene box or in a silicon mold.",
    "To prepare the silicon mold: Vigorously mix two components of the silicon elastomer kit in a 10:1 ratio. De-bubble the solution using a vacuum pump for 15-20 min. Subsequently, cast the solution inside the bottom part of the well plate and de-bubble using a vacuum pump for 10 min. Place the mold into an oven and cure at 60 °C for 8 h to obtain a semi-flexible elastomer that is peeled off the plate.\nFreeze the plate at -80 °C for a minimum of 4 h in the polystyrene box or the prepared silicon mold.\nTransfer the plate to a liquid nitrogen tank or a -150 °C freezer for long-term storage.\n6. Thawing of cardiac spheroids\nNOTE: Do not thaw more than one plate at a time to ensure a quick thawing process.\nPrepare 20 mL of 37 °C preheated basal medium in a 50 mL conical tube.\nCollect the cell plate with CSs from the liquid nitrogen and place it in the incubator for 15 min. Set the incubator conditions to 37 °C, 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 90% humidity.\nRemove the supernatant and the cell pellet remains, and resuspend each well in a warm basal medium. Use 200 µL of medium per well.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 70 x g.\nRepeat steps 6.3 and 6.4.\nRemove the supernatant until the cell pellet remains and add 200 µL of CM thawing medium in each well.\nPlace the plate of CSs on an orbital shaker at 70 rpm in an incubator for 24 h. Set the incubator conditions to 37 °C, 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 90% humidity.\nAspirate 50 µL of the medium from each well and add 100 µL of RPMI + B27 medium per well for the first 48 h.",
    "Aspirate 100 µL of the medium from each well and add 100 µL of maturation medium per well. Maintain the cells in the maturation media and refresh the medium every 2-3 days.\n7. Assessment of intracellular Ca2+ transients\nNOTE: CSs are in culture for a total of 3 weeks; 2 weeks before freezing, and 1 week after thawing. The 'fresh' controls are age-matched.\nAfter 1 week of culture, the thawed CSs are optimal for calcium handling optical imaging. Use a calcium dye (e.g., Cal520AM) to assess the uptake and release of Ca2+ from the cells.\nTreat them with 100 µL of calcium dye medium per well and incubate for 60 min in the incubator. Set the incubator conditions to 37 °C, 5% CO2, 21% O2, and 90% humidity.\n\tNOTE: Cal520AM is light-sensitive. Perform all loading procedures and experiments in the dark.\nPrepare the calcium acquisition and analysis system.\n\t\nPower the microscope, ensuring the environmental control option is on.\nAdjust the camera and framing aperture dimensions to minimize the background area.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, the Leica Thunder DMi8 microscope was used; other microscope systems are applicable as well until they allow a sampling rate above 30 frames/second (fps).\nRecord a video with a consistent stream of 2−10 peaks within 10 s and scan across the 96-well plate, initially moving to the left, then downward in a zig-zag fashion to cover the whole plate. Measure the calcium signal using a 488 nm laser; set the contrast to a black background with a bright green signal during calcium release.\nAfter acquiring the Ca2+ transients, analyze the data with the fluorescence traces analysis software (e.g., CyteSeer, Vala Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n8. Flow cytometry analyses of dissociated cardiac spheroids",
    "NOTE: In this study, flow cytometry was used to determine the viability of the CSs before and after the thawing process.\nCollect the CSs in a 15 mL conical tube using a 5 mL pipet to avoid spheroid damage and centrifuge for 3 min at 70 x g. Aspirate the supernatant and add 1 mL of PBS.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 200 x g. Aspirate the supernatant and dissociate the CSs by adding 1 mL of cardiac detachment solution (e.g., tryple). Incubate the tube at 37 °C for 15 min.\nUsing a 5 mL pipet, mechanically dissociate the cells by flushing with 2 mL of basal medium until single cells can be seen when observed under the microscope.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 200 x g.\nAspirate the supernatant and fix the CMs with 200 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in 1x PBS. Incubate for 10 min at RT.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 200 x g. Aspirate the supernatant and add 1 mL of PBS.\n\tNOTE: Pause point: The fixed hiPSC-CMs can be stored at 4 °C for up to 4 weeks.\nTransfer the cell suspension to a FACS tube and centrifuge for 3 min at 200 x g. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend 1 x 105 cells in 50 µL of the permeabilization buffer.\nIncubate the cells for 30 min at 4 °C.\nFor immunofluorescence flow cytometry analysis, perform steps 8.9.1-8.9.4.\n\t\nResuspend the cells in the flow cytometry buffer (50 µL) containing the α-actinin antibody at a dilution of 1:300. In another FACS tube, resuspend 1 x 105 cells in the flow cytometry buffer (50 µL) with the respective isotype control (e.g., FITC mouse IgM, κ isotype [1:200 dilution]). Similarly, resuspend 1 x 105 cells in 50 µL of flow cytometry buffer for negative control.",
    "Incubate the cells for 30 min at 4 °C.\nAdd 2.5 mL of flow cytometry buffer and centrifuge the cells at 200 x g for 3 min at 4 °C; discard the supernatant and repeat this washing step twice.\nResuspend the cells in 50 µL of flow cytometry buffer with the secondary-antibody goat-anti-mouse (1:300 dilution).\n\t\tNOTE: Place the tube in the dark since the secondary-antibody solution is light-sensitive.\nFor viability check with propidium iodide (PI), add 150 µL of PI per sample (1:1,000) and incubate for 15 min.\n\tNOTE: Place the tube in the dark since the PI solution is light-sensitive.\nAdjust the gates according to the standard gating strategy as shown in Supplementary Figure 1 and analyze the cells with a flow cytometer.\n9. Immunofluorescence staining of whole 3D spheroids\nNOTE: This protocol is based on the protocol for high-resolution 3D imaging of whole organoids upon immunofluorescent labeling, which was previously published29 and adjusted for cardiac spheroids. During the procedure, all pipet tips and conical tubes can be coated with 1% wt/v BSA-PBS in order to prevent the spheroids from sticking to plastics. To coat the materials, dip into the 1% BSA-PBS. Be careful not to damage the spheroids by using the 5 mL pipet, avoiding mechanical disruption.\nCollect the CSs in a 15 mL coated tube with a 5 mL pipet. The spheroids are visible to the eye. Collect ~20-50 spheroids per antibody combination. Centrifuge for 3 min at 70 x g and aspirate the supernatant.\nCarefully resuspend the spheroids in 1 mL of ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution in 1x PBS using a coated 1 mL tip.\nFix at 4 °C for 45 min. After 20 min, gently resuspend the spheroids using a coated 1 mL tip. This evens fixation among all spheroids.",
    "Add 10 mL of ice-cold PBS to the tube and gently mix by inverting the tube. Incubate for 10 min at 4 °C and spin down at 70 x g for 3 min.\n\tNOTE: From this step onward, coating of tips and conical tubes is generally not needed as CSs do not stick to the tip after fixation.\nBlock the CSs by resuspending the pellet in ice-cold SWB (200 µL of SWB per well) and transfer the spheroids to a 24-well suspension culture plate.\n\tNOTE: CSs from one large pellet can be split over multiple wells to perform different stainings. Use ~20-50 CSs per antibody combination.\nIncubate at 4 °C for at least 15 min.\nAdd 200 µL of the SWB in an empty well to serve as a reference well.\n\tNOTE: For the immunofluorescent staining, 48- or 96-well plates can also be used to reduce antibody usage. However, the staining and washing results can be reduced due to the smaller volume per well.\nAllow the spheroids to settle at the bottom of the plate, by leaving the plate tilted at a 45° angle for 5 min.\nRemove the SWB, leaving the CSs in 200 µL of the SWB (use the reference well to estimate the minimal volume of 200 µL).\nAdd 200 µL of the SWB with the primary antibodies 2x concentrated (e.g., ɑ-actinin [1:200] and Troponin T [1:200]) and incubate overnight at 4 °C while rocking/shaking (40 rpm on a horizontal shaker).\nThe next day, add 1 mL of the SWB to each well.\nAllow the spheroids to settle at the bottom of the plate by leaving the plate at a 45° angle for 5 min.\nRemove the SWB, leaving 200 µL in the plate. Add 1 mL of SWB and wash for 2 h with slow rocking/shaking.",
    "Repeat steps 9.12 and 9.13 twice more.\nAllow the CSs to settle at the bottom of the plate by leaving the plate tilted at 45° for 5 min. Remove the SWB, leaving 200 µL in each well\nAdd 200 µL of the SWB with secondary antibodies, conjugated antibodies, and dyes 2x concentrated (e.g., DAPI [1 µg/mL], mouse-AF488 [1:500], rabbit-AF568 [1:500]), and incubate overnight at 4 °C in the dark, while slowly rocking/shaking.\nThe next day, repeat steps 9.12 and 9.13 twice more.\nCarefully transfer the CSs to a 1.5 mL tube and spin down at 70 x g for 3 min.\nRemove as much of the SWB as possible by pipetting without disrupting the CSs.\nAdd the embedding solution (ES; at least 50 µL, at RT) using a 200 µL tip with the end cut off and resuspend gently to prevent bubble formation and incubate at RT for 20 min.\nIn the meantime, create a square container on a glass slide with either nail polish or silicone sealant.\nCut off the end of a 200 µL tip and transfer the CSs in ES to the middle of the square container.\nPlace a square coverslip on top. To reduce air bubbles, place one side of the coverslip first, then slowly lower the coverslip from one side to the other until there is no trapped air under the surface, and then release the coverslip.\nGently push on all edges of the coverslip to seal it to the nail polish or silicone sealant.\nLeave the slide overnight at RT. The next day, the slide is ready for imaging.",
    "NOTE: Optical clearing by the ES can cause minor tissue shrinkage. However, this cannot affect the overall morphology of the CSs. The staining procedure can be paused here by storing the slides at 4 °C (for at least 1 week) or at -20 °C (for at least 6 months)."
