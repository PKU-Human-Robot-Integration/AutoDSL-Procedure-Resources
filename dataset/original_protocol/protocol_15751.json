    "Procedures involving animals have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Missouri-Columbia.\n1. Construction of DNA plasmids\nNOTE: For in vitro and in vivo imaging, DNA plasmids encoding GCaMP5G/6s with astrocyte- and neuron-specific promoters and mitochondrial targeting sequences are constructed.\nInsert mitochondrial matrix (MM)-targeting sequence (mito-) ATGT CCGTCCTGAC GCCGCTGCTG CTGCGGGGCT TGACAGGCTC GGCCCGGCGG CTCCCAGTGC CGCGCGCCAA GATCCATTCG TTG17 into the cloning sites EcoRI and BamHI in the backbone of adeno-associated virus (AAV) plasmid pZac2.1 to obtain plasmids containing astrocytic gfaABC1D promoter or neuronal CaMKII promoter18,19,20.\nSubclone GCaMP5G/6s into the cloning sites BamH I and Not 1 in the above plasmids to obtain new plasmids pZac-gfaABC1D-mito-GCaMP5G/6s and pZac-CaMKII-mito-GCaMP5G/6s that target transgene expression in mitochondria in astrocytes and neurons20,21 (Figure 1A).\nPrepare pZac-gfaABC1D-mito-GCaMP5G and pZac-CaMKII-mito-GCaMP6s DNA plasmids for transfection for in vitro study (Section 2). Produce AAV vectors with serotype 5 for astrocytes and serotype 9 for neurons for in vivo study18 (Section 3).\n2. In vitro mitochondrial Ca2+ imaging in astrocytes and neurons\nPrepare primary astrocytes from the cortex of P1 neonatal mice and primary neurons from the cortex of E15-16 embryos18,22,23,24, and culture them on 12 mm diameter glass coverslips in 24-well plates using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and neuronal basal medium (NBM) containing 2% B27, respectively.\nTransfect mature astrocytes and neurons with pZac-gfaABC1D-GCaMP6s and pZac-CaMKII-GCaMP5G plasmids using lipid based transfection reagent to express GCaMP6s in the mitochondria of astrocytes and GCaMP5G in the mitochondria of neurons18,20,21. Transfect cells in each well with 0.5 µg of DNA, and change the medium 6 h later.\n\tNOTE: The astrocytes and neurons are ready for imaging 1-2 days after transfection.\nPerform in vitro mitochondrial Ca2+ imaging 1-2 days after transfection.",
    "Transfer the glass coverslips cultured with astrocytes or neurons to the PH-1 perfusion chamber under an epifluorescence or two photon microscope.\nStimulate astrocytic mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake with 100 μM ATP in ACSF, or stimulate neuronal mitochondria with 100 μM glutamate/10 μM glycine20,25 (Figure 2 and Figure 3).\n\t\tNOTE: Solution changes from ACSF to ATP- and glutamate/glycine-containing ACSF are controlled by an ALA-VM8 perfusion system21. The speed of the solution change is controlled at 1-2 mL/min by adjusting a valve.\n3. In vivo mitochondrial Ca2+ imaging in astrocytes and neurons\nAAV preparations.\n\t\nPrepare the following recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors using the DNA plasmids prepared in section 1: rAAV2/5-gfaABC1D-mito-GCaMP5G and rAAV2/9-CaMKII-mito-GCaMP6s vectors.\n\t\tNOTE: In this experiment, rAAV vectors of serotype 5 were prepared to express GCaMP5G in mitochondria in astrocytes and rAAV vectors of serotype 9 were prepared to express GCaMP6s in mitochondria in neurons.\nStereotaxic AAV injection.\n\t\nAnesthetize the mouse with 3% isoflurane.\n\t\tNOTE: Later during the surgery, the isoflurane levels are reduced to 2%.\nAfter the mouse reaches a surgical level of anesthesia, as determined by tail and toe pinch, shave the hair over the surgery site, motor or somatosensory cortex, with a hair trimmer.\nPosition the mouse on the mouse stereotaxic device and fix the head with ear bars. Apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to protect them during the surgery. Use a heating pad to keep the body temperature of the mouse at 37 °C throughout the surgery.\n\t\tNOTE: Perform surgery using aseptic procedures. All surgical tools need to be sterilized either by autoclaving or a hot bead sterilizer.\nAfter the mouse is mounted on the stereotaxic device, sterilize the scalp with alternating iodine based scrub and 70% ethanol three times. Make an incision in the midline of the scalp to expose the injection site.",
    "Cut open the skin in the bregma-lamda axis and a create a ~1 mm diameter burr hole with a high speed drill at the intended injection location of the motor or somatosensory cortex.\nUse a 33 G Hamilton syringe containing adeno-associated virus (rAAV2/5-gfaABC1D-mito-GCaMP5G vectors [1 x 1011 GC] or rAAV2/9-CaMKII-mito-GCaMP6s vectors [1 x 1011 GC]) to inject up to 1 µL of virus at the target area.\n\t\tNOTE: For example, for cortical viral delivery, inject the virus solution at two depths in multiple steps. First, insert the needle to a depth of 1 mm from the dura and allow 5 min for the brain to recover. Then, move the needle up to ~700 µm depth and inject 500 nL of the virus solution at an injection speed of 10 nL/s using a hamilton syringe controlled by a microsyringe pump controller. After the injection is completed, wait for 5 min to allow the virus to diffuse into the brain. Then, move the needle up to the second injection location at a depth of 300 µm. Here, inject an additional 500 nL of the virus solution. Wait for 10 min to allow the virus to diffuse into the brain.\nClose the scalp and the skin using a tissue adhesive. Let the mice recover on the heating pad. Send mice back to the animal facility after recovery.\nCranial-window intstallation and in vivo two-photon (2-P) imaging of mitochondrial Ca2+ signals.\n\tNOTE: Cranial window implantation is done 3 weeks post AAV injection over the motor or somatosensory cortex26,27,28,29. Carprofen (10 mg/kg) is injected subcutaneously to provide relief from potential pain before surgery. The cranial window surgical procedures are identical to the AAV injection surgical procedures and are performed under aseptic conditions.\n\t\nAnesthetize the mouse with 3% isoflurane.",
    "NOTE: This is the initial dose and reduce to 2% for the surgery later on. During imaging, an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 130 mg ketamine/10 mg xylazine/kg body weight dissolved in ACSF is used for anesthesia.\nPosition the mouse on the mouse stereotaxic device and fix the head with ear bars. Apply ophthalmic ointment to eyes. Use a heating pad to keep the body temperature of the mouse at 37 °C throughout the surgery.\n\t\tNOTE: All surgical tools need to be sterilized.\nMake an incision of 5-8 mm long in the midline of the scalp and remove a flap of skin using a pair of scissors.\nAfter the skull is exposed, perform 2.0-3.0 mm diameter craniotomy using a high-speed drill over the virus injected area (i.e., motor cortex or somatosensory cortex, Figure 1B). First, make four small holes, and then drill along in a circle connecting the holes. Then, lift and remove the bone with sharp scissors and remove. The exposed dura mater can be removed or kept intact for impantation of the cranial window.\nPlace a glass coverslip of 3-5 mm in diameter carrying a transparent silicone over the craniotomy. Use a toothpick to push the cranial window gently onto the surface of the brain. Then, seal the edge with a small amount of silicone adhesive.\n\t\tNOTES: Alternatively, instead of silicone disk, 1.2% low melting point agarose gel can be used between the cover glass and the brain tissue.\nFinally, seal the edges of the coverslip with dental cement. Take care to apply the cement slightly at the edge of the cranial window for strong bonding. Attach a custom-made metal head plate to the skull with dental cement.",
    "NOTE: The metal plate is used to fix the head of the mouse to the stage of 2-P microscope during the imaging session (Figure 1C).\nAdd 0.5 mL of ACSF solution over the coverslip on the cranial window for water immersion during imaging.\nPerform time-lapse in vivo 2-P imaging of mito-GCaMP5G in astrocytes and mito-GCaMP6s in neurons with 910 nm wavelength through the cranial window (Figure 1C)18,20,27.\n\t\tNOTE: During imaging, mice are on the heating pad to maintain physiological temperature. The mice will be sacrificed immediately after the imaging session is completed.\nLabel astrocytes in vivo with sulforhodamine 101 (SR101) when it is necessary to determine colocalization.\n\t\t\nAt the end of step 3.3.4, apply 100 µL of 100 µM SR101 in ACSF on the cortical surface for 1-5 min.\nRinse the surface with ACSF to wash away the unbound SR101. Using 2-P imaging, co-labeling of mito-GCaMP5G and SR101 in astrocytes can be observed 45-60 min later (Figure 4A).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
