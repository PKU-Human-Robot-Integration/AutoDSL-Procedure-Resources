    "Sprague Dawley rat (Charles River) pups of both genders are used. Litters are culled to 12 on PD1 (birth being PD0). The dams are maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. Experimental procedures have been approved by Memorial University’s Institutional Animal Care Committee.\n1. Nose Plug Construction\nNOTE: This procedure was adapted and modified from Cummings et al. (1997)35.\nAquire polyethylene-20 tubing and 3-0 silk suture thread.\nCut a small piece of polyethylene-20 tubing to approximately 0.8 mm.\nThread silk suture through the prepared tubing such that there is thread on either side of the section of tubing.\nOn one end of the thread outside of the plug, tie a knot in the thread.\nPull the section of tubing down over the knot in the thread. The knot should lodge inside the tubing.\nTrim both ends of the thread such that ~2 mm of thread is protruding from one end of the tubing (see Figure 1A).\n2. Naris Occlusion before Training\nRemove pup from dam and place in a secure dish covered with regular bedding.\nUse a cotton tip application to dab a local anesthetic jelly, 2% Xylocaine, on the naris to be occluded.\nAllow the pup to rest in the dish for ~3 min.\nHold the pup gently but securely in the non-dominant hand.",
    "Using the dominant hand, pick up a nose plug and dab the same local anesthetic jelly around the tip from which the thread is not protruding. This will act as both an anesthetic for any minor pains associated with plug insertion and will act as a lubricant inside the naris. NOTE: The effect of Xylocaine starts within a couple of minutes and lasts 20-30 min. Pups in general show good tolerance for plug insertion after xylocaine jelly application (minimum struggling and vocalization).\nGently insert the nose plug by firmly holding the pup and slowly rotating the plug with very gentle pushes until the plug is fully inserted and only the 2 mm thread is protruding from the naris (see Figure 1B). There should be no bleeding from either naris during this process. Pups with bleeding during nose plug insertion are excluded and returned to dams\nAllow the animal to rest in this dish for 5 min in order to habituate to the plug.\nRemove the pup from the habituation dish and begin the conditioning paradigm24.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51808/51808fig1highres.jpg\nFigure 1. Construction of a nose plug. A) Schematics showing the steps of making a nose plug. A thread is pulled through polyethylene tubing; a knot is made and pulled into the middle of the tubing to block it; two ends are cut with a 2 mm residue in one end out of the tubing. B) Front and lateral view of a rat with a nose plug in one naris.\n3. Scented Bedding Preparation\nWearing new gloves and in a fume hood to prevent odor contamination, place 500 ml of woodchip bedding into a plastic bag.\nUse a syringe to draw up 0.3 ml peppermint extract, and spray this over the bedding in the plastic bag.",
    "Tie the bag shut, shake the bag vigorously, and allow the bedding to rest in the bag for 5 min.\nPlace the scented bedding in a clear, shallow, acrylic training box (20 x 20 x 5 cm3, Figure 2A) uncovered in a fume hood for 5 min before use. Once the bedding is prepared, discard these gloves, and do not allow these gloves to come in contact with the animals.\nPlace the unscented bedding in an identical clear plastic box, and ensure that it does not come into contact with the scented bedding or used gloves.\n4. Odor Conditioning Paradigm (See Picture in Figure 2A)\nPups undergo either a single conditioning session, on PD 6, or multiple trial sessions (one session per day, PD 3-6).\nPlace the habituated pup on scented bedding. For control odor only (O/S-) pups, leave these pups on the bedding for 10 min, then skip to step 4.5. For experimental odor + stroke (O/S+) pups, continue to the following steps in this section.\nStroke the pup for 30 sec using a small paintbrush. Use rapid circular motions primarily around the hind region of the pup.\nAllow the pup to rest for 30 sec.\nRepeat steps 4.2 & 4.3 for a total of 10 min (i.e. 10 pairings of stroking + odor).\nRemove pup from the conditioning box, remove the nose plug and return the pup to the dam.\n5. Lateralized Odor Preference Testing (See Picture in Figure 2B)",
    "Testing occurs at various time points (e.g., 24 or 48 hr) following the final training session. Testing is carried out in a stainless steel testing chamber (30 x 20 x 18 cm3), which is placed on top of two training boxes (training box is described in 3.4), separated by a 2 cm neutral zone. One training box contains peppermint-scented bedding while the other box contains clean, unscented bedding. The floor of the testing chamber is a metal grid, which is then covered by a removable sheet of plastic mesh (Figure 2B).\nPrepare one peppermint and one unscented bedding as per Section 3, and place each box under opposite sides of the testing chamber, 2 cm apart. Place the plastic mesh on the metal-grid floor of the testing chamber.\nRemove the pup from the dam and place a firm dab of odorless silicone grease on the naris that is occluded during training. Re-apply the grease throughout the first testing procedure as needed. NOTE: Random naris occlusion during training and testing may be considered to avoid bias.\nPlace pup in the neutral zone of the testing chamber.\nAllow the pup to explore the chamber for 1 min, recording how long the pup spent over the two sides of the chamber (i.e. over peppermint or neutrally-scented bedding).\nAllow the pup to rest for 1 min in a covered plastic holding chamber.\nRepeat steps 5.2 & 5.3 for a total of 10 min (i.e. 5 test trials separated by 5 rest trials) switching the initial orientation of the pup in the chamber in order to control for direction preferences.\nImmediately following testing, wipe away the grease from the naris.\nInsert a polyethylene noseplug into the opposite naris as per section 2 and allow the animal to rest for 10 min.",
    "Test the pup once again as in 5.3 -5.6, remove the plug, and return the pup to the dam. Remove and clean the plastic mesh of the testing chamber with 95% ethanol and allow the liquid to evaporate. Place the mesh back before testing the next pup.\n\tNOTE: Applying silicone grease at the first naris occlusion during testing prevents the chance of bleeding and stress associated with nose plug insertion.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/51808/51808fig2highres.jpg\nFigure 2. Early odor preference training and testing. A) Early odor preference training using odor + stroking paradigm. B) Two choice odor preference testing with peppermint bedding on one side, control unscented bedding on the opposite side. A 2 cm neutral zone is placed in between.\n6. Testing the Effectiveness of Single Naris Occlusion\nThis experiment is performed to determine whether single naris occlusion leads to lateralized activation of the olfactory system.\nPerform unilateral naris occlusions on PD 6 or 7 pups as described in section 2.\nAfter ~5 min habituation, place the pup in a covered plastic container and expose it to 30 µl pure peppermint oil soaked in a piece of tissue for 10 min.\nImmediately after the peppermint odor exposure, inject the pup intraperitoneally (i.p.) with chloral hydrate (400 mg/kg) as a general anesthetic, or pentobarbitol, (150 mg/kg).\nOnce fully anesthetized (showing no response to tail or foot pinch), transcardially perfuse the pup with ice-cold solutions of saline (0.9%) for ~1 min, followed by paraformaldehyde (4%, dissolved in 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution, PBS).\nAfter 10 min of paraformaldehyde perfusion, collect the brain and place it in paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, then transfer the brain to a sucrose solution (20% in PBS) for an additional 24 hr.",
    "Cut coronal brain slices at 30 μm thickness with a cryostat. Collect OB and PC slices and mount onto gelatin-coated slides, followed by standard immunohistochemistry staining for pCREB antibody21,25,30.\n7. Testing the Reversibility of Single Naris Occlusion\nThis experiment tests whether the blocking effect is reversible at 24 hr following the removal of the nose plug.\nPerform unilateral naris occlusions on PD 6 or 7 pups as described in section 2.\nAfter 15 min (equivalent to the duration of the naris occlusion during training – 5 min habituation + 10 min training), remove the nose plug, and return the pup to the dam.\n24 hr later, expose the pup to the peppermint odor in a covered plastic container for 10 min as described in 6.2.\nFollow same steps in sections 6.3-6.6.\nSubscription Required.
