    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell seeding on the assay plate for HCS\nTiming: 26–48 h\nIn this step, the seeding of the cells on the assay plate is described.\nPreparation of HCS plates (∼2–24 h).\nCoat a black wall, clear F-bottom 96- or 384-well plate with appropriate coating solution. We recommend using Geltrex (1:100 dilution).\nCritical: The use of transparent clear bottom microplates is essential for this assay. To determine the appropriate microplate type to be used, it is helpful to check beforehand which microplates are already calibrated with the correct dimensions in the instrument. Further helpful information on specific requirements and plate considerations can be found here: https://www.perkinelmer.com/de/lab-products-and-services/application-support-knowledgebase/microplates/high-content-screening-plates.html[href=https://www.perkinelmer.com/de/lab-products-and-services/application-support-knowledgebase/microplates/high-content-screening-plates.html].\nAlternatives: Other coating reagents may also be used. Instead of Geltrex, it is also possible to use Matrigel (200 μg/mL). However, Matrigel is not a defined material, so it may be possible to observe batch-related variability. We obtained comparable results also using poly-l-ornithine (50 μg/mL on glass; 20 μg/mL on polystyrene) plus laminin (10 μg/mL on glass; 5 μg/mL on polystyrene).\nNote: Follow manufacturer’s guidelines for coating with Matrigel (https://www.corning.com/worldwide/en/products/life-sciences/products/surfaces/matrigel-matrix.html[href=https://www.corning.com/worldwide/en/products/life-sciences/products/surfaces/matrigel-matrix.html]).\nSeeding of iPSC-derived neural cells (∼ 24 h).\nSplit the cells using 0.5 mL Accutase for 6-well plates for 5 min at room temperature (RT) (20°C–25°C).\nDilute the Accutase to reduce its activity by adding at least double amount of culture media.\nTransfer the cells into a 15 mL falcon tube.\nCentrifuge for 3 min at 120 × g, remove the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in culture media.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer or cell counter.\nPipette 100 μL cell suspension containing 30,000–50,000 cells per well of a 96-well plate.\nPlace the plate in a tissue culture incubator for 24 h.",
    "Critical: Optimal seeding density might need to be adapted according to the cell type used. Very dense cultures make HCS image analysis difficult, as the individual cell identification becomes more challenging. When using NPCs, we recommend using 30,000–50,000 cells per well of 96-well plates (90,000–150,000 cells∗cm-2) and 13,000–16,000 cells per well for 384-well plates (130,000–150,000 cells∗cm-2) (Zink et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]).\nNote: The described NPCs retain their multipotent identity over multiple passages and can therefore be used in a wide passage range. We generally use NPCs in the range of 10–25 passages.\nStaining procedure for monitoring mitochondrial membrane potential\nTiming: 1 h",
    "To detect changes in ΔΨm in live cells, iPSC-derived neural cells are stained with the potentiometric fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM). This dye is a lipophilic cation that accumulates across plasma membranes and within the mitochondrial matrix in an inverse proportion to the mitochondrial membrane potential according to the Nernst equation. TMRM accumulation in the mitochondria is dependent on both the plasma membrane potential and the mitochondrial membrane potential. Based on the surface-to-volume ratio, equilibration of TMRM across the mitochondrial membrane occurs more rapidly than across the plasma membrane (Nicholls, 2006[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). At high concentration, TMRM forms non-fluorescent aggregates within the mitochondrial matrix. Therefore, high concentration of TMRM should be avoided, and the dye should be used in non-quenching mode, which is considered to be the case for concentrations below 30 nM (Ward et al., 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). The incorporation of the dye indicates active mitochondria and does not affect mitochondrial function. Several papers describe the use of TMRM to analyze ΔΨm with slight differences in the staining method (Zimmermann et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Perry et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]; Nicholls, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). In our protocol, iPSC-derived NPCs are stained with 10 nM TMRM for 30 min, and then washed before imaging. In our hands, this is the most robust approach, as during imaging the ΔΨm signal remains relatively stable for 30 min (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). For imaging experiments exceeding 30 min, we recommend to not wash out TMRM before the analysis but instead to dilute the TMRM concentration by adding more media to each well. This approach may allow the TMRM dye to remain in equilibrium for a longer time window (Iannetti et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).",
    "Lastly, given the influence of plasma membrane potential on TMRM accumulation, we advise to not use TMRM in case there might be indications that the plasma membrane potential is changing during the specific experimental set-up. In these cases, alternative strategies to TMRM should be applied (Nicholls, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]).",
    "imgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1880-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Kinetic assessment of ΔΨm\n(A) Continuous monitoring of the ΔΨm over time and assessment of the robustness of the assay (Z′ score) in NPCs treated with DMSO or with FCCP and antimycin A (AA). iPSC-derived NPCs were stained with 10 nM TMRM (in non-quenching mode) for 30 min followed by a washing step and HCS-based quantification of ΔΨm.\n(B) Quantification of ΔΨm intensity based on the TMRM signal in iPSC-derived NPCs treated with DMSO or with FCCP and antimycin A (AA) at dedicated time points. Mean ± SD, unpaired Student’s t-test, ∗∗p < 0.01.\nPrepare TMRM stocks.\nPrepare a stock solution of TMRM at a concentration of 25 mM in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).\nAlternatives: Instead of TMRM, it is also possible to use TMRE (Invitrogen/Molecular Probes T-669).\nNote: Protect TMRM solution from light, and store sealed at −20°C. Prepare further dilutions in media fresh before each experiment.\nPrepare staining solution.\nAdd 10 nM TMRM and 1 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 dye to the culture media.\nCritical: The concentration of TMRM should be adjusted depending on the neural cell type used. For iPSC-derived NPCs, we carried out dose-dependent experiments and determined 10 nM as the lowest concentration of TMRM showing a reliable signal for HCS.\nFor control wells, prepare the staining solution containing ΔΨm modulators: FCCP and antimycin A (collectively defined as F+AA).\nAdd 10 nM TMRM, 1 μg/mL Hoechst 33342 dye, 10 μM FCCP and 10 μM antimycin A to the culture media.\nNote: FCCP and antimycin A lead to ΔΨm depolarization and therefore serve as internal controls for the HCS assay. FCCP and antimycin A are dissolved in DMSO as 25 mM stock solutions. Adjust FCCP and antimycin A concentrations depending on the neural cell type used if needed.",
    "Alternatives: In addition to F+AA, other mitochondrial inhibitors and modulators may be included to support ΔΨm quantification (Nicholls, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). For example, rotenone can be used to lower ΔΨm by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I, oligomycin to increase ΔΨm and prevent reversal of ATP synthase that may lead to unwanted usage of cytosolic ATP, and cyclosporine A to mitigate the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP).\nInclude DMSO controls accordingly.\nCritical: Wear protective clothing, gloves, and eye/face protection when handling DMSO or solutions containing DMSO. DMSO irritates the skin and eyes. Dispose DMSO in accordance with applicable regional, national, and local laws and regulations.\nOptional: For high-throughput compound screenings, we recommend to add the compounds to the iPSC-derived neural cells prior to the staining, and then incubate the drugs for 1–24 h. The incubation time depends on the respective compounds and may need to be experimentally validated and adjusted accordingly. Following appropriate incubation, neural cells can be stained by adding 2 × TMRM and Hoechst (in medium) directly to the cells (without aspiration of the old medium) to obtain a final TMRM concentration of 10 nM and 1 μg/mL Hoechst 33342. After addition of the staining solution, continue with step 9.\nAspirate the medium and wash once with PBS without MgCl2/CaCl2.\nIncubate the iPSC-derived neural cells with 50 μL live-cell staining solution for 96-well plates and 30 μL for 384-well plates (with and without ΔΨm modulators) and incubate for 30 min at 37°C, 5% CO2.\nTurn on the HCS imaging platform. If possible, set the temperature to 37°C and the CO2 level to 5%. If CO2 control is not available, ensure that the imaging media contains an alternative pH buffer such as HEPES.",
    "After the incubation time, remove the live-cell staining solution and gently wash 1–2 times with pre-warmed (RT) PBS without MgCl2/CaCl2.\nAdd 100 μL for 96-well plates and 30 μL for 384-well plates of phenol red-free cell culture media appropriate for your cell type of use (e.g., for NPCs see media list above).\nCritical: In our hands, the TMRM signal is relatively stable for 30 min when washed out and kept without temperature control (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). In case of time-dependent variability or lack of comparable and robust TMRM signal intensity across the plate, we recommend to perform image acquisition without complete washing of TMRM and to dilute the concentration of the dye by adding imaging medium (Iannetti et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]) (see also troubleshooting problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]).\nProceed to step 13 (HCS imaging) immediately for HCS.\nHCS imaging\nTiming: 1–2 h (depending on image acquisition settings)\nThis step describes the image acquisition using the Operetta CLS High Content Analysis System (PerkinElmer).\nPlace the plate in the HCS imaging platform.\nDefine the plate type (e.g., 96- or 384-well plate based on step 1.a).\nCheck manufacturer comments on plate usage.\nSelect the appropriate light source and filter: for instance, detection at wavelength ranges from 365–465 nm for Hoechst 33342 and 550–610 nm for Alexa Fluor 568 / TMRM.\nAlternatives: Instead of Alexa 568, comparable results can be obtained using Cy3.\nChoose operational mode non-confocal (wide-field fluorescence).\nSelect the objective.\nSee the notes section for advice on which objective to use.\nNote: For live-cell imaging, always apply the control of temperature and CO2 if possible.\nAlternatives: It is possible to select confocal as operational mode. For measuring TMRM intensity, the non-confocal wide-field fluorescence mode is sufficient. However, for other HCS experiments (for example to assess detailed mitochondrial structure) confocal imaging may be crucial.",
    "Note: For image acquisition of an entire 96- or 384-well plate, we recommend using the 20 × objective, as it reduces the image acquisition time. In our hands, the 20 × objective (air or water immersion) provides most robust results.\nDetermine microscope settings, exposure time, and Z-set-off for additional Z-positions. We suggest binning of 2 × 2, which reduces noise and the image size and increases acquisition speed, even if it lowers the digital resolution.\nSelect a well containing iPSC-derived neural cells and take a snapshot. Find focus height using the Z-stack. The Z-stack heights may need to be optimized. Start at negative values and go up to positive until cells are in focus. Set the appropriate focus height for each channel individually.\nEvaluate brightness and set exposure times for each channel individually.\nCritical: Set up the image acquisition based on a well containing control cells. However, check the settings also in the wells treated with ΔΨm modulators (or test compounds) in order to cover the dynamic range of the experiments and avoid over- or underexposure. Different drugs may cause big changes in ΔΨm and TMRM fluorescence. Hence, imaging should be tuned to avoid signal saturation and take into account the expected dynamic range of the experimental set up.\nChoose a different well to confirm or adjust settings and exclude plate-tilting.\nNote: Accidental tilting of the plate could lead to out-of-focus images on one side of the plate. Ensure that the plate is placed correctly in the plate holder.\nDefine the plate layout.\nSelect scan area and number of fields.\nDetermine the appropriate number of fields needed to represent the well (e.g., 8 fields in a single well of a 96-well plate).\nStart the run.",
    "Note: Maximal excitation for TMRM may vary depending on the concentration of the dye in the mitochondria and the solvents used.\nNote: Choosing “all fields” in plate layout definition will prolong the time of measurement.\nNote: Avoid using the outer rows and outer columns of any given HCS plate due to edge effects (e.g., thermal evaporation and differences near the plate edge). The outer rows and outer columns should not be left blank but should be filled with buffer solution or PBS (at least the same volume as the wells containing cells, e.g., 100 μL for 96-well plates).\nHCS analysis of the mitochondrial membrane potential using open-source software (CellProfiler)\nTiming: ∼2–6 h (depending on the computer capacity and the number of images to be processed)\nThis step describes the HCS image analysis for the quantification of ΔΨm in iPSC-derived neural cells based on the open-source software CellProfiler (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, 1B and 1D), which is also suitable to quantify images from high-throughput experiments. The image processing time is based on the number of images acquired per field and the computing capacity. In our hands, 4–8 images (fields of view) per well are sufficient to generate robust data. When using the Operetta CLS, 16-bit images are generated with a pixel resolution of 2160 × 2160 resulting in 8–10 GB imaging data per 96-well plate (no outer row image acquisition).\nThe pipelines and examples images that can be used to try out our HCS protocol can all be downloaded here: https://github.com/StemCellMetab/Mitochondrial-membrane-potential[href=https://github.com/StemCellMetab/Mitochondrial-membrane-potential]. We also included a video showing all the steps of the CellProfiler analysis pipeline.\nInstall CellProfiler (https://cellprofiler.org/releases[href=https://cellprofiler.org/releases]) and download the analysis pipeline (CellProfiler-Pipeline_MMP_20×.cpproj), and pipelines for illumination correction (CorrectIlluminationCalculate.cpproj, ApplyIllumCorr_DNA.cppoj, AplyIllumCorr_TMRM.cpproj) from GitHub (https://github.com/StemCellMetab/Mitochondrial-membrane-potential[href=https://github.com/StemCellMetab/Mitochondrial-membrane-potential]).\nOpen the “CorrectIlluminationCalculate” pipeline.",
    "Note: For measuring intensity, correction of the illumination variation can be important. Due to the optics of the microscope, or imperfection in the slide or sensor bias, the intensity within a fluorescence image can vary by more than two-fold across the field of view. By applying the “CorrectIlluminationCalculate” and “CorrectIlluminationApply” modules, it is possible to compensate for non-uniformities in illumination.

    "Note: The illumination pattern may differ between experiments. For example, different staining reagents for a batch of images or changes in the settings in the optical path of the microscope will change the illumination pattern. This means that the illumination function has to be performed for each set of imaging or sample preparation condition separately.\nNote: For small image sets, the workflow for creating and applying the illumination correction can be integrated into the CellProfiler analysis pipeline. For large image sets, it is advisable to first create and save the illumination functions using one CellProfiler pipeline, and then retrieve and apply the illumination functions using the CellProfiler analysis pipeline as described in this protocol.\nFor image analysis of ΔΨm using CellProfiler, open the CellProfiler analysis pipeline (CellProfiler-Pipeline_MMP_20x.cpproj: https://github.com/StemCellMetab/Mitochondrial-membrane-potential[href=https://github.com/StemCellMetab/Mitochondrial-membrane-potential]).\nAdd the pre-processed images (or raw images if illumination correction has not been applied) generated in step 37 by dragging and dropping them into CellProfiler.\nGo to “Metadata”.\nEnter the extraction method and metadata source as under step 25.\nGo to “NameAndTypes” and adjust the settings.\nIn the default settings of the downloaded pipeline channel 1 is set as DNA (Hoechst staining for nuclei) and channel 2 is set as TMRM (TMRM staining for ΔΨm).\nSet the default input and output folders.\nSelect the “File” dropdown menu and select “Preferences”.
