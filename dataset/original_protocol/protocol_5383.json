    "Figure 4 provides the overview of the protocol, including all the possible stop points and temperatures (theoretically you can stop at these points for up to multiple weeks).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180328/20180328210903_7190.jpgFigure 4. Flowchart summarizing the steps in Part II: Total RNA isolation and rRNA degradation Designing DNA probes against rRNA sequencesDesigning the DNA probes against rRNA sequences is a key part of this procedure, as this is how you target RNA for degradation. For targeting nuclear rRNA, you need to obtain the sequences of 5S, 5.8S, 18S and 25S rRNAs and their internal and external transcribed spacers. If you plan to carry out rRNA degradation for total cellular RNA, remember to also target mitochondrial and plastid rRNAs. For many species, these sequences can be found from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/[href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nucleotide/].Design your probes to be 60 bp long, cover the entire length of rRNA (including the spacer regions as they will be present in nuclear rRNA), and to reverse complement the rRNA sequences. Any sequence analysis software able to convert sequences to reverse complement (SnapGene, Geneious, etc.) can be used.Order your probes (DNA oligos) as a pre-made mix at 10 nmol in 1,000 μl of water. This is your 10 μM stock.Dilute your stock 10x into a working mix where each probe is at 1 μM.Total RNA isolation with QIAGEN RNeasy Micro Kit from nuclei isolated using INTACTPurify the nuclear RNA using the QIAGEN RNeasy Micro Kit as follows:Start by adding 350 μl of lysis buffer RLT (with 10 μl beta-mercaptoethanol/1 ml added) to the 20 μl of purified nuclei. Vortex vigorously for 2 min.Centrifuge the lysate at 1,000 x g (3,100 rpm) for 2 min at RT to pellet the beads. Place the tube onto a DynamagTM-2 Magnet and transfer the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml tube.",
    "Add 350 μl of 70% ethanol and vortex several times to mix.Pipette lysate/ethanol mixture into an RNeasy MinElute spin column resting in a 2 ml collection tube and centrifuge at 10,000 x g (9,700 rpm) for 1 min at RT. Discard flowthrough.Add 350 μl of buffer RW1 to the column. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g (9,700 rpm) for 1 min at RT. Discard flowthrough and move the column to a new 2 ml collection tube.Add 500 μl of buffer RPE to the column. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g (9,700 rpm) for 1 min at RT. Discard flowthrough.Add 500 μl of 80% ethanol to the column. Centrifuge at 10,000 x g (9,700 rpm) for 1 min at RT. Discard flowthrough and move the column to a new 2 ml collection tube.Open the column lid and centrifuge at top speed (16,000 x g) for 5 min at RT. Discard the flowthrough and place the column into a new 1.5 ml tube.Add 20 μl RNase-free water onto the column membrane and allow to stand for 1 min. Centrifuge at 16,000 x g for 1 min at RT.Store RNA at -80 °C. DNase I treatment to eliminate genomic DNA contaminationUse DNase I protocol for Turbo DNase I as follows:Add to 20 μl of RNA:2 μl of 10x DNase I reaction buffer1 μl DNase IIncubate for 30 min at 37 °C.Add 2 μl DNase I inactivation reagent (vortex well before adding) and incubate for 5 min at RT (vortex every 1 min).Spin down (2,000 x g for 5 min) and recover 20 μl into a new tube.RNA cleanup using Agencourt RNAClean XP bead to remove DNase bufferAdd 1.8 volume (e.g., 36 μl for 20 μl of RNA) of RNAClean XP beads to the reaction.Incubate at RT for 10 min.Onto a magnet for 5 min.",
    "Remove most of the supernatant (leave 5 μl behind to avoid pipetting up beads).Leave tubes on the magnet, add 200 μl 70% ethanol, let stand for 30 sec.Remove all the supernatant.Repeat 70% wash as above once more (two washes total).Remove as much of the EtOH as possible.Air dry beads on the magnet for 10 min (until appear dry, see Figure 5).Add 15 μl RNase-free water to the first aliquot dried bead and mix.If you have aliquoted samples, pool back together.Incubate at RT for 5 min.Onto the magnet for 5 min.Recover 15 μl eluate.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180403/20180403184118_4026.jpgFigure 5. Appearance of Agencourt XP beads. A. After ethanol has been removed, the beads appear glistening and wet. B. Beads ready for elution look dry, the pellet is thinner and often lighter in color.NanoDrop for [RNA] and 260/280 so that you know the RNA concentration for adjusting probe concentration.rRNA probe hybridization to bind DNA probes to rRNAReaction size for Steps 6 and 7 needs to be 6 μl + 4 μl (total 10 μl) for the buffers to be optimal for each step. You can prepare multiple aliquots of the reaction and pool back before DNase I treatment (Step 8). Successful RNA-Seq libraries have been made from a single 0.1 μg reaction.Add following together:3.8 μl RNA (if this would be more than 1 μg RNA, make up with RNase-free water) 1.2 μl 5x Hybridization buffer H1 (Recipe 1)1.0 μl probe mix–choose your concentration as follows:If your RNA amount is 1 μg, use 1 µM/oligo working stock of probe mix.If your RNA amount is 0.1 μg, dilute probes to 0.1 µM/oligo. Note: This is the most common probe concentration in our experiments.If your RNA amount is 0.01 μg, dilute probes to 0.01 µM/oligo.If your RNA amount is under NanoDrop detection range, use 0.01 µM/oligo.",
    "Incubate as follows in a PCR machine:95 °C for 2 minRamp down to 45 °C at 0.1 °C/sec45 °C for 5 minHold at 45 °CHybridase® (thermostable RNase H) reaction to digest RNA from RNA:DNA hybridsPrepare a master mix that you preheat to 45 °C (in a hot block):1 μl 10x Hybridase buffer H2 (Recipe 2)1 μl Hybridase (5 U/μl)2 μl nuclease-free waterAdd 4 μl of the MM to hybridization reaction still at 45 °C (keep in the PCR machine).Incubate at 45 °C for 30 min.Remove to ice.DNase I treatment to digest DNA oligos/probes from RNA poolUse DNase I protocol for Turbo DNase I.Add to 40 μl of RNA (for four aliquots pooled):4 μl of 10x DNase I reaction buffer2 μl DNase IIncubate for 30 min at 37 °C.Add 2 μl DNase I inactivation reagent (vortex well before adding) and incubate for 5 min at RT (vortex every 1 min). The minimum volume of inactivation reagent to add is 2 μl–so even smaller volumes (e.g., 10 μl), add 2 μl.Spin down (2,000 x g for 5 min) and recover 43 μl into a new tube.RNA cleanup using Agencourt RNAClean XP beadsAdd 1.8 volume (e.g., 77.4 μl for 43 μl of RNA) of RNAClean XP beads to rxn.Incubate at RT for 10 min.Onto a magnet for 5 min.Remove most of the supernatant (leave 5 μl behind to avoid pulling up beads).Leave tubes on the magnet, add 200 μl 70% ethanol, let stand for 30 sec.Remove all the supernatant.Repeat 70% wash as above once more (two washes total).Remove as much of the EtOH as possible.Air dry beads on the magnet for 10 min (until appear dry, see Figure 5). Add 10 μl RNase-free water to the first aliquot dried bead and mix. If you have aliquoted samples, pool back together.",
    "Incubate at RT for 5 min.Onto the magnet for 5 min.Recover 10 μl eluate. Store RNA at -80 °C.Note: The eluate contains your rRNA-free RNA. This is suited for RNA-Seq library construction but remember to skip any polyA-enrichment steps. The RNA-Seq library protocol we used (Reynoso et al., 2018) is the non-strand specific random primed library described by Townsley et al. (2015)."
