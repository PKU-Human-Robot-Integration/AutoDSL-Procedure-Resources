    "All experiments were approved by the local regulatory agency (LANUV of Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany) and were performed according to the guidelines of animal use. Animals were fed with a standard chow diet and received tap water ad libitum. All equipment and chemicals necessary to each step of the experiment are available in the Table of Materials.\n1. Preparation of the Latex Cap and Intraventricular Balloon\nMake an aluminum mold using a milling machine that matches the average size of the rat heart (bodyweight of 300-350 g). Polish the mold with superfine (10/0) emery paper.\n\tNOTE: The detailed metrics of the mold are shown in Figure 1A.\nVertically fix the neck of the aluminum mold to the milling machine to prepare the latex cap.\n\tNOTE: The milling machine causes the mold to slowly rotate. Alternatively, an electric motor can be used.\nPour 20 mL of liquid latex (commercially purchased, see the Table of Materials) into a 50 mL glass beaker.\nLower the mold until the entire body of the mold is immersed in the latex solution.\nSlowly lift the mold (5 cm/min) while rotating.\nKeep rotating the mold for an additional 15 min, until the latex on the surface of the mold is solidified.\nAdd about 1 g of talcum powder to the surface of the mold (already covered by a thin latex film) to prevent damage while detaching.\nGently detach with fingers the already dried latex cap from the mold surface; the latex cap is now ready for use (Figure 1B).\nConnect the outlet of the latex cap to 15-cm silicon tubing (ID = 0.2 mm), used later for the collection of CT.\nFill the ventricular latex balloon with water and firmly fix it onto an L-shaped metal cannula connected to a 1 mL, water-filled syringe (Figure 1C).",
    "NOTE: This will be used to ensure the upright positioning of the heart (see below).\nMake sure that the balloon is airtight by performing several deflating/inflating tests with the attached 1 mL syringe.\nConnect the cannula, via a three-way stop, to a pressure transducer for the future measurement of intraventricular developed pressure (Figure 1C).\n2. Preparation of Krebs-Henseleit Buffer (KHB) and the Langendorff Perfusion System\nSet up a Langendorff perfusion system by using either constant-flow (driven by a roller pump) or constant-pressure (generated by static pressure in a glass column) mode.\n\tNOTE: Details of the Langendorff heart preparation have been described previously12.\nPrepare 2 L of a modified KHB (in mM: 116.02 NaCl, 4.63 KCl, 1.10 MgSO4·7H2O, 1.21 K2HPO4, 2.52 CaCl2·2H2O, 24.88 NaHCO3, 8.30 D-glucose, and 2.0 sodium pyruvate).\nWeigh all chemicals but CaCl2 and dissolve them in 1.8 L of double-distilled water in a 2-L flask.\nBubble the medium with carbogen (95% O2/5% CO2) for at least 5 min for equilibration (pH: 7.4) under magnetic stirring.\nAdd 0.74 g of CaCl2.2H2O and bring up the total volume to 2 L with double-distilled water.\nContinue stirring and bubbling the medium with carbogen for an additional 5 min.\nFilter the KHB through a 0.2 µm filter to eliminate small particles that may obstruct the microcirculation of the heart.\nPreparation of the Langendorff perfusion system.\nPlace the filtered KHB into a pre-warmed water bath (38 °C); keep bubbling with carbogen to generate a pressure of 100 cmH2O inside the KHB reservoir.\nConnect the reservoir to the glass column to establish 100 cmH2O hydrostatic pressure for the Langendorff perfusion with KHB; continue bubbling the KHB inside the column with carbogen.\nAdjust the temperature of the warming system so that the temperature at the aortic cannula outlet is 37 °C.",
    "Ensure that the tubing system is bubble-free.\nOxygenate the KHB with carbogen for an additional 5 min, until the PO2 in the KHB reaches 500-600 mmHg (measured by a blood-gas analyzer).\nSet up the perfusion system to run either at a constant pressure of 100 cmH2O or at a constant flow of about 10-20 mL/min using manual switching. Alternatively, use an interchangeable STH pump controller to instantly switch to the perfusion mode.\n3. Isolation and Cannulation of the Heart\nNOTE: Male Wistar rats with bodyweights of 300-350 g were used so that the sizes of hearts matched the pre-cast latex cap. Rats underwent either a ligation of the left arterial descending (LAD) for 50 min, followed by reperfusion or were sham operated. Details of the methodology for the induction of myocardial infarction (MI) were reported elsewhere13. The reversed-heart experiments in the infarct animals were performed 5 days after operation.\nAnesthetize rats using an isoflurane vaporizer (2% V/V) connected to an animal holding chamber (20 L).\nTransfer the rats to an operation table (not temperature controlled) after deep anesthesia is reached.\nLift the skin and muscle just below the sternum using forceps and cut around the lower margin of the ribs with heavy scissors.\nUsing fine scissors, make a small cut into the diaphragm, at the rib margin. Cut the ribs caudally to make a flap of the entire ventral chest wall.\nGently grab the heart with the thumb and index and middle fingers and slowly lift it upwards so that the cardiac vessels become slightly stretched.\nExcise the heart until the aorta is fully exposed.\nPlace the heart in a 100 mL beaker containing 50 mL of ice-cold KHB (4 °C) and move it to the perfusion apparatus.",
    "Immediately mount the heart via the aorta onto a dripping cannula and securely tighten it with a suture (4-0). Avoid air bubbles entering the heart.\nApply constant perfusion pressure (100 cmH2O). Alternatively, a full flow rate (starting with 20 mL/min) can be applied.\n\tNote: The time from the opening of the thorax to the attachment of the heart to the perfusion cannula should take about 3 min in the hands of an experienced operator.\n4. Reversed-heart Model\nGently rotate the aortic cannula until the posterior wall of the heart is in en face view.\nRemove the connective tissue with scissors to expose the opening of the left atrium, making it ready for intraventricular cannulation.\nInsert the deflated latex balloon attached to a rigid catheter via the left atrium into the left ventricle.\nInflate the balloon until it fills the entire ventricular cavity (the inflating volume is pre-marked on the syringe).\nInvert the heart until it is upside-down, supporting it by the intraventricular balloon catheter.\nAs demonstrated in Figure 1C, mechanically stabilize the inverted heart in an upright position using the intraventricular balloon with a rigid metal catheter.\nAdjust the position of the heart to avoid excessive twisting of the aortic root.\nAdjust the diastolic pressure to 3-5 mmHg (measured by the intra-ventricular balloon; see Figure 1C).\nObserve the epicardial surface of the heart and ensure that small droplets form.\nPlace the latex cap onto the surface of the heart by gently pushing it to cover the entire heart using the fingers.\nMake sure that the latex cap covers most of the ventricular surface.\nRemove the air bubbles, if any, inside the cap and the tubing by gently sucking with a 1-mL syringe.\nAdjust the distal opening of the CT-letting tubing to 10 cm below the horizontal level of the heart.",
    "NOTE: This procedure ensures slight sucking by negative hydrostatic pressure.\nCollect drops of CT in a 1.5 mL collection tube placed in ice mixed 1:1 with NaCl. Collect about 0.15-1.5 mL of CT.\n\tNOTE: The ice/NaCl mixture stabilizes the temperature in the collection tube to below zero (about -4 °C).\n\tNOTE: The sampling time depends on the experimental purpose. The flow rate of the CT is about 27 ± 20 µL/ min in sham-operated animals (n = 3) and 100 ± 47 µL/min for the coronary-ligated animals (n = 11).\nWeigh and snap-freeze CT samples in liquid nitrogen and store them at -80 °C for later measurements.\n5. Analysis of the CT\nUse the CT fluid for the analysis of metabolites, depending on the scientific question.\n\tNOTE: The data shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 were collected from a constant-pressure perfusion (100 cmH2O), and about 0.15-1.5 mL of CT fluid was collected within a period of 10 min. This time and volume were sufficient for the proteomic (minimum: 50 µL; Figure 2)14 and HPLC (minimum: 20 µL; Figure 3)15 analysis of various purines.\nSubscription Required.
