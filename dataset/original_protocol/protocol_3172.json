The assay is\n      performed using the inner 60 wells of a 96-well plate using eight\n      different concentrations of test substance. Each condition is tested in\n      three technical replicates (see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). The highest\n      concentration used in this assay (concentration 8, C8) should be\n      determined by literature research on solubility and estimated\n      cytotoxicity.

If the analysis is finished different icons\n                  appear. In the “Details Analysis” the color legend of the\n                  plot, the mathematical models used for fitting and the RPFs\n                  and their confidence intervals were reported. The third icon\n                  “Report Analysis results” contain the plots fitted with\n                  four-parameter models for RPF determination (see\n                  Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]). The heading of the plots refers\n                  to the model, which is used for the analysis (Expon m5; i.e.,\n                  exponential model).\n                \nNote: The symbols in the plots",
    "(black triangle, red cross, green diamond…) follow\n                  alphabetical order of labels in the data set column\n                  “compound”.\n                \nNote: In these plots the doses\n                  from the second substance are expressed in multiplicative of\n                  the first substance (using the RPF) and then added to the dose\n                  of the reference substance. From the obtained plots it is not\n                  possible to visually see the potency of the substances. This\n                  will be only possible by using another data format, which is\n                  only compatible with the R-Version of PROAST. The RPF will be\n                  displayed in the legend of the plots and named RPF-“first\n                  three letters of the respective compound” (see\n                  Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4], here “RPF-B”).\n                \nNote: Ensure that the names of\n                  your test compounds differ clearly in the first three letters.\n                \nCritical: In the web\n                  application, data are analyzed by fitting with two different\n                  four-parameter models: Exponential model and Hill model (see\n                  Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).

This\n            contains the concentration of the single substances (column A and B)\n            the mean value and standard deviation of the respective response and\n            the sample size, as well as a column which defines if it is a single\n            substance or a mixture (column “Compound”), see example in\n            Table 13[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl13].\n            table:files/protocols_protocol_2941_14.csv\nNote: The symbols in the plots\n              (black triangle, red cross, green diamond…) follow alphabetical\n              order of labels in the data set column “Compound”. Therefore, the",
    "mixture should be named with the prefix \"zz-\" in the\n              \"Compound\" record column to ensure that the mixtures\n              receive the same symbol in all plots.
