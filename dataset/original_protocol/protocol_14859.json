    "The Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal protocols.\n1. Equipment\nThe composite system set up, ready to measure the PV curve is shown in Figure 1.\nVolume measurement:\n\t\nGenerate a constant rate of inflation and deflation by using a syringe pump with a switch that allows the user to quickly reverse the pump after reaching the pressure limits. For mouse PV curves, use a very lightly greased 5 ml glass syringe with the initial volume (prior to inflation) set at 3 ml of air. 3 ml is sufficiently large to measure volumes in nearly all mouse PV curves.\nMeasure the volume delivered by the pump by attaching a linear differential transformer to the pump housing, with a small sensor rod connected to the moving syringe plunger.\n\t\tNote: An empirical means to correct for gas compression in the system is described under the PV curve recording section.\nPressure measurement:\n\t\nUse a standard inexpensive pressure gauge with a range of 0-60 cm H2O (0-1 PSI).\nRecording measurement:\n\t\nTo record the PV curve use any digital recorder with XY capabilities (e.g., PowerLab). Set one channel to record the corrected volume signal and another channel to record the transpulmonary pressure (Ptp), in order to graph the PV curve. Use a bridge preamplifier that connects to the main Powerlab to measure the pressure. Calibrate the pressure channel from 0-40 cm H2O, and calibrate the volume channel from 0-3 ml.\n2. Correction for Gas Compression\nNote: This is a critical initial step in the set up, since as the pressure increases, the gas volume decreases, and thus the volume of air delivered to the mouse will be increasingly less than the displacement of the syringe barrel.",
    "Close the stopcock that will connect the PV system to the lungs, so no gas can leave the system. Start the infusion and observe if the corrected Volume channel on the recorder shows any measurable changes as the pressure increases to about 40 cm H2O. If so, then correct as in the next steps.\n\t\nCorrect for gas compression empirically by subtracting from the plunger displacement measurement (i.e., the uncorrected volume) a term proportional to the inflation pressure. Do this on a Powerlab channel (called Vc) to show the volume signal minus a coefficient times the pressure.\nDetermine the coefficient in the equation. First, make an initial guess, turn the chart recording on, and start the pump. Since the inflation tubing is sealed, adjust the pressure coefficient multiplier to make the Vc channel read zero as the pressure rises from 0-40 cm H2O. If it goes up or down, simply adjust the correction factor until it stays flat over this pressure range. This correction factor will always be the same, if the same 3 ml starting volume in the syringe is not changed.\n3. Experimental Tests in Mice\nProcedure for measurement of the PV curve in mice. All animal protocols were approved by the Johns Hopkins University Animal Care and Use Committee.\n\t\nAnesthetize mice (C57BL/6 mice at 6-12 weeks of age) with ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (15 mg/kg), and confirm anesthesia by the absence of reflex motion.\n\t\tNote: The PV curve can be completed in anesthetized mice in less than 10 min and is a terminal procedure.",
    "Tracheostomize the mice with an 18 G stub needle cannula. Do this by making a small incision in the skin overlying the trachea, locating the trachea, then making a small slit in the trachea, where the stub needle can be inserted. Secure the cannula by tying with thread.\nAllow the mice to breath 100% oxygen for at least 4 min. This can be via spontaneous breathing from a bag or with a ventilator nominally set with a tidal volume of 0.2 ml at 150 breaths/min.\nClose the tracheal cannula and allow 3-4 min for the mouse to absorb all the oxygen. This oxygen absorption procedure results the death of the animals and in a nearly complete degassing of the lung11. Confirm death of the mouse by measuring the cessation of the heartbeat with ECG electrodes or direct observation.\nOnce the degassing of the lung is complete and the lung volume is zero, begin inflating the lung with room air in the syringe pumpÂ at a rate of 3 ml/min. Monitor the pressure trace on the digital recorder, and when it reaches 35 cm H2O, reverse the pump.\nFollow the deflation curve until pressure reaches negative 10 cm H2O, by which time the airways have collapsed, trapping air in alveoli preventing further volume reduction. Immediately reverse the pump again, allowing the lung to reinflate as the collapsed airways open. This heterogeneous opening is normally apparent by the noisy looking inflation limb at the initial part of this 2nd inflation.\nWhen the pressure again reaches 35 cm H2O, reverse the pump direction, and continue to deflate the lung until this 2nd deflation limb reaches 0 cm H2O. Then stop the pump.",
