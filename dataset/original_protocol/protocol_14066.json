    "All procedures were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the University of Louisville Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC-approved protocol 18223) and the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals11.\n1. Animals\nUse 4-month-old female Fisher 344 rats (BW~150-180 g) for the study.\n2. Ultrasound Imaging before IR surgery\nAnesthetize the rat with isoflurane - induction chamber at 5% with 1.5–2.0 L/min O2 flow followed by 1.5–2.0% with 1.5–2.0 L/min O2 flow. This anesthesia is maintained throughout the experiment, during the resting and stress stages.\nPlace the animal in a supine position and shave the thorax. Maintain the body temperature at 37-38 °C using the built-in warming platform. Monitor the heart rate using the software.\n\tNOTE: Proper anesthesia is crucial for maintaining the heart rate at normal physiological rates (between 295-350 beats/min).\nApply ophthalmic vet ointment to prevent the dryness of eyes prior to the imaging.\nPerform echocardiography using 13–24 MHz linear probe (e.g., MS250) (Figure 1A).\nPlace the animal in the supine position on the heated platform. Ensure that the anesthesia is controlled via the nose cone. Then position the probe to obtain the parasternal short axis view (PSAX) using the rail system (Figure 1B).\nMoving the probe in the rostral direction from the PSAX, locate the pulmonary artery (Figure 1B).\nMove the probe slightly in the direction caudal from the pulmonary artery to view the LAD and store the image.\n\tNOTE: The LAD is difficult to find without Color Doppler, so B-Mode images of the LAD are not always possible.\nWhen individual differences make it difficult to locate the LAD coronary artery, follow the technique mentioned below:\n\t\nMove the probe lateral to the pulmonary artery.",
    "Angle the platform so that the animal is inclined, inverted, or slightly towards the right side so that the left ventricle is more readily visible with the probe.\nOnce the image in B Mode is captured or cine-stored, click the Color Doppler on the touch screen (Figure 1C). Visualize the coronary artery (white arrow indicates LAD) in the short axis (Figure 1C). The red color, as seen in real time, is indicative of the direction of the flow (i.e., blood flow is towards the probe).\nAfter visualizing LAD on a color-Doppler mode, change the mode to the pulse wave (PW)-mode. Look for the presence of a yellow-indicator line on the coronary artery (Figure 2A).\nPlace the yellow PW-line in the middle of the coronary artery. Ensure that the angle is parallel to the direction of the flow.\n\tNOTE: Velocity of the flow is highly dependent on the angle of the PW line, so be sure to match the angle of the on-screen probe with the angle of the LAD. Use the touch screen to adjust the angle; PW angle should be less than 60°.\nUse cine store to capture the velocity of the resting LAD coronary flow at the peak diastole as wave forms (Figure 2B).\nAfter obtaining of resting LAD flow velocity, measure the maximum flow velocity of LAD during the stress to calculate CFR. To measure the maximum flow velocity during the stress, infuse Dobutamine at a dose of 20 µg/kg/min via tail vein8 (Figure 2C).\n\tNOTE: Dobutamine infusion should not be more than 8 min. Use an infusion pump and set the diameter of the infusion pump to 14.43 for BD 10 mL syringe.",
    "Use 25-G infusion butterfly set for the tail vein cannulation. To place the infusion needle, place a small strip of gauze around the base of the rat’s tail, then grab with hemostats and twist the tourniquet to apply pressure and cause the vein to enlarge.\nPlace the needle while directly connected to Dobutamine syringe.\n\t\tNOTE: Take extra care not to accidentally introduce drug when drawing up blood to ensure proper placement of the needle in the tail vein. Also, be sure to avoid introducing an air bubble into the vein, as an embolism may be fatal to the animal.\nOnce the needle is placed, stabilize it with a glue and a piece of surgical tape, securing the infusion line to the tail.\nRemove the hemostats and tourniquet to recover the flow.\nPlace Dobutamine syringe in the infusion pump and set it to inject 20 µg/kg/min.\nDuring Dobutamine infusion, carefully monitor the LAD peak and heart rate. Periodically record LAD PW peaks in the Doppler mode, especially whenever it increases in response to Dobutamine.\n\t\tNOTE: The stress challenge induced by Dobutamine causes the heart to work harder; this often results in the movement of the heart and the LAD. Be prepared to move the animal, the probe, or both in order to keep the LAD in view.\nAfter LAD peaks and heart rate have plateaued during the challenge, stop the Dobutamine infusion, remove the tail vein infusion set and remove the animal from the platform. Allow the animal to recover in its home cage.\nSelect Peak Vel tool to obtain the peak diastolic velocities from the images shown in Figure 2B and C.\nCalculate the CFR index as the ratio of the LAD stress (Dobutamine) peak diastolic flow velocity to the resting LAD peak diastolic flow velocity (Figure 2A).",
    "3. Ischemia Reperfusion Injury\nAnesthetize rat with isoflurane - induction chamber at 5% with 1.5–2.0 L/min O2 flow followed by 1.5–2.0% with 1.5–2.0 L/min O2 flow.\nConfirm the depth of anesthesia by the lack of the pedal withdrawal reflex. Use ophthalmic vet ointment on the eyes to prevent dryness. Maintain the proper body temperature of 37-38 °C using a heating pad or an animal temperature controller.\nAdminister pre-surgical Meloxicam, 5 mg/kg intramuscularly, 15 min before the surgery, followed by 2 mL subcutaneous bolus of 0.9% saline to prevent dehydration during the surgery. Sterile gloves and instruments were used, and aseptic techniques were employed. Using the fiber-optic light source, intubate rat using 18-gauge IV catheter and connect to the ventilator.\nLigate LAD using 8-0 monofilament suture through 15 mm opening at the 5th intercostal space. Tie a plain knot and leave for 30 min. Visually confirm ischemia in all rats via discoloration of the heart surface12. Release the ligature after 30 min and verify reperfusion by the reddening of the previously discolored area of heart muscle for 1-2 min12.\nClose the rib cage using 4-0 absorbable suture with an interrupted suture pattern, then close the skin using 5-0 non-absorbable silk suture with continuous suture pattern.\nRemove the animal from anesthesia. Allow the animal to recover in the home cage. 5mg/kg Meloxicam was injected intramuscular in every 24 hours before euthanizing the animal (72hours after surgery).\n4. Ultrasound imaging after IR surgery\n72 h after IR surgery, measure the coronary flow and CFR again. Compare the measurements to before IR measurements. Repeat steps 2.1 to 2.15 as described above.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
