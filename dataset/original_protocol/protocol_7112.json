    "Part I: Preparation of conditioned medium (CM) Cultivation of HEK293T cells to condition media with Noggin, Rspondin-1, and Wnt3a (Figure 1)Note: HEK293T cells that have been genetically modified with mNoggin-Fc, mRspondin-1-Fc, or mWnt3a express the proteins of interest and secrete them into the medium. This conditioned medium is an important component of the medium used for organoid cultivation. Thaw one aliquot of each HEK293T cell line, transfer into 10 mL of corresponding culture medium, and centrifuge at 500 × g for 5 min.Carefully aspirate the supernatant to remove the DMSO present in the freezing medium.Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of culture medium and transfer the suspension into a T175 flasks containing 25 mL of growth medium (for a total of 30 mL).Incubate cells at 37°C and 5% CO2 under humidified atmosphere.When cells are properly attached (usually after 1-2 days), add antibiotics for selection (sAB) if necessary (mNoggin-Fc cells = 500 µg/mL GeneticinTM; mRspo1-Fc cells = 300 µg/mL ZeocinTM; mWnt3a cells = no sAB).When cells reach approximately 80% confluency, split all cells into new flasks (p1) by washing with PBS and further trypsinizing them until cells detach from the plate; dilute cells and plate them into new T175 flasks (1:3-1:4).Add sAB to all flasks of mNoggin-Fc and mRspo-1-Fc cells.When cells reach 80% confluency, split cells for passage 2 (p2) again at 1:3 or 1:4.Note: Higher dilutions are also possible to obtain more cells. For conditioned medium (CM), cells must reach 100% confluency.IMPORTANT: DO NOT add sAB into flasks for conditioned medium.Note: If cells for further cultivation are required, add antibiotic to those cells/flasks only. When cells have reached 100% confluency, remove the culture media and add 50 mL of Ad+ medium (without selection antibiotics).",
    "After at least 5 to 7 days incubation, pool the conditioned media (CM) of the corresponding cell lines to be filtered through 0.22 µm filters into sterile bottles and aliquot. To prevent the bottle top vacuum filters from clotting, CM can be transferred into 50 mL tubes and centrifuged at 800 × g for 3 min at 4°C (to pellet and remove non-adherent cells) before filtration.Store the CM at -20°C for further use, avoid freezing and thawing.The remaining cultivation flask can be used for at least 3-6 passages, to repeat this process and generate more conditioned medium.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4298/bioprotoc-12-02-4298-g001.jpgFigure 1. Graphical illustration of the medium conditioning procedure for one HEK293T cell line. sAB; selection antibiotics.Note: Some researchers cultivate passage 2 (p2) still with antibiotics (with sAB) until cells reach 100 % confluency. Importantly, Ad+ medium has to be free of selection antibiotics (NO sAB). Performing dot blot analysis, to determine the quantity of Rspondin-1 and Noggin in conditioned media (CM) (Figure 2)Note: In the HEK293T cells utilized, Noggin is fused to a human IgG1 Fc-fragment and Rspondin-1 is fused to a murine IgG1 Fc-fragment. Dot blots are performed to detect Fc-coupled proteins. If needed, prepare a dilution series of the respective IgG standard for the dot blot. Standard for Rspondin-1: Normal mouse IgG1, Santa Cruz, catalog number: SC-3877. Standard for Noggin: InVivoMAb human IgG1 isotype control, bxcell, catalog number: BE0297.Recommended dilution for the standard row (IgG Stock 0.2 mg/mL): From 0.2 to 0.025 mg/mL, in 5% BSA in TBS-T (0.1% Tween® 20).Thaw an aliquot each of the conditioned Noggin and Rspondin-1 medium and prepare a dilution series. Dilute in 5% BSA in TBS-T: undiluted – 1:2 – 1:4 – 1:8 – 1:16.",
    "Prepare two nitrocellulose membranes, by cutting an approximatelly 7 × 9 cm sized blot, which can be incubated in 50 mL tubes. Draw lines with a pencil, to indicate where the spots will be applied.Spot 2 µL of samples or standards on the corresponding membranes. Minimize the area by applying the solution/dot very slowly. Spot all samples, standards, and negative controls.Transfer sampled nitrocellulose membranes into a box or Petri dish, cover with a lid, and let membranes dry (for several hours or overnight).Transfer each membrane into a 50 mL tube.Block nonspecific sites by incubating membranes in blocking solution (5% milk in TBS-T) for 30-60 min at RT on a roller.Remove blocking solution and incubate with the HRP-conjugated secondary antibody [anti-human HRP (mNoggin-Fc) or anti-mouse HRP (mRspo1-Fc), both 1:10,000 in blocking solution] for 30 min at RT on a roller.Wash three times with TBS-T, for a minimum of 10 min each on the roller.Use a Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate to develop the signal (usually, very strong signal is achieved).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4298/bioprotoc-12-02-4298-g002.jpgFigure 2. Representative dot blots of Rspondin-1 and Noggin conditioned medium. Dot blot analysis used to estimate the amount of Rspondin-1 (Rspo1) (A) and Noggin (B) in the conditioned medium (CM). Undiluted (undil.) and diluted CM were spotted and, for quantification, the respective standards were spotted on each membrane. Standard 1 for Rspo1: Normal mouse IgG1, Santa Cruz, material #71. Standard 2 for Noggin: human Fc fragment, InVivoMAb human IgG1 isotype control, material #72. Unconditioned Ad+ medium was used as blank.Note: The standards can also be used as a concentration series, to better quantify amounts as in (B).Performing TopFlash assay, to determine the activity of Wnt3a conditioned medium (CM) (Figure 3)Notes:  1) For the TOPFlash assay, a well-transfectable cell line, such as H1299 cells, can be used.",
    "2) Wnt3a is not fused to a Fc-fragment, hence dot blot analysis as performed for Noggin and Rspondin-1 is not possible. Therefore, the TopFlash assay is performed to assess the activity of produced Wnt3a. Culture a well-transfectable cell line.Seed cells into a 6-well plate in 2 mL of culture medium.After 24 h culturing, transfect cells with 500 ng TOP/200 ng Renilla or 500 ng FOP/200 ng Renilla plasmid, using LipofectamineTM 3000 according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.After 24 h of incubation of cells with the transfection reagent, remove medium and add 2 mL of conditioned Wnt3a medium. Incubate for at least 16 h at 37°C.After incubation with Wnt3a CM, a luciferase assay is performed using the Dual-Glo® Luciferase Assay System, according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4298/bioprotoc-12-02-4298-g003.jpgFigure 3. Representative result of TopFlash assay. Conditioned medium (CM) was used in the TopFlash assay, to estimate the activity of Wnt3a in the medium. Therefore, cells were transfected with TOP or FOP plasmids and incubated with CM Wnt3a. Unconditioned Ad+ medium was used as blank control.Part II: Preparation of murine matched-pair organoids from one donor mouse Note: Colonic matched-pair organoid preparation means the generation of tumor-derived and normal epithelial-derived organoids from the same recipient. Murine colorectal tumors were induced using the chemicals azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), as previously described (Tanaka et al., 2003; Becker et al., 2005; Klemke et al., 2021). Preparation of organoids Isolation of mouse intestinal epithelia and tumorsNotes:  1) For an optimal reduction of contamination risk, disinfect or sterilize all used tools before starting. 2) For an optimal reduction of contamination risk, PBS can be supplemented with antifungal drugs, such as amphotericin, antibiotics, such as penicillin/streptomycin, or combined drug solutions, such as antibiotic-antimycotic (e.g., from Thermo Fisher).",
    "3) When a fresh vial of Matrigel® is used, it can be slowly thawed at 4°C on ice overnight, then aliquoted into 1.5 mL or 2 mL tubes. Before usage, thaw Matrigel® aliquots on ice for at least one hour. 4) Matrigel® should always be kept on ice. There are different possible ways to handle Matrigel® under the biosafety hood. For optimal sterility, disinfectable gel-filled cooling bags or cooling racks can be used for cooling. Ice-filled disinfectable buckets or boxes provide easier handling, but pose a higher risk of contamination. 5) Matrigel® can be diluted generally up to 15-20% in cold medium before usage, depending on protein concentration and stiffness of the Matrigel® lot. Attention should be paid for lot variations (protein concentrations should be higher than 9 mg/mL and endotoxin levels should be lower than 1.5 EU/mL). 6) Plates can be pre-warmed to facilitate Matrigel® solidification. Euthanize and prepare a mouse using an appropriate method, according to local legislation and the respective animal experiment application.Remove the intestinal tract completely or any intestinal segments individually.Note: Optimal sterility at these steps minimizes contamination risks in culture. For easier handling, attach the mouse in a supine position to a sanitizable cutting board or a styrofoam board using needles or cannulas. Disinfect the fur before opening the skin with a pair of scissors. For optimal sterility, carefully separate the skin from the abdominal wall to prevent perforation of the peritoneum. Using fresh scissors, open the peritoneal cavity. Remove the mesenteries with a forceps and cut the intestine into smaller easier to handle parts (e.g., roughly the diameter of a Petri dish). Place the intestinal parts into cold PBS, labelled appropriately for small intestine and large intestine (colon).Gently flush the intestinal parts with cold PBS e.g., by using a rodent gavage needle.",
    "Place the intestinal parts onto a Petri dish lid and open each intestinal part longitudinally, with the luminal surface upwards.For tumor preparation from the colon, dissect several tumors, transfer them into ice-cold PBS, and cut them in small fragments.For normal small intestinal and colonic epithelia preparation, very gently scrape off excess mucus or residual feces from the intestine with a cover slip.Cut normal intestinal fragments out of the intestine. Be careful and avoid dissection of parts with tumorous epithelial tissue. Cut intestinal fragments into smaller pieces of approximately 2 mm × 2 mm. (For example, cut once longitudinally and then transversally, using a razor blade to guide and a scalpel to cut.)Transfer the pieces into a 50 mL tube filled with approximately 15 mL of cold PBS. From now on, always work on ice.Washing:Normal small intestine:Wash thoroughly. Use a pre-wet 10 mL serological pipette to pipette the pieces up and down (approximately 30 times). This step is crucial to remove the intestinal microflora adhered on the mucosa. To improve the preparation yield, pre-coating the pipettes with FCS can be recommended.Let the pieces settle by gravity and gently aspirate the supernatant.Add 15 mL of cold PBS and repeat the rinsing procedure.Repeat these washing steps (i-iii) 10 times. The supernatant should be almost clear at the end of this procedure. Because of the high amount of mucous in the small intestine, washing steps must be carried out properly.Normal colon:Wash moderately. Use a pre-wet transfer pipette to pipette the pieces up and down (approximately 10 times). This step is crucial to remove the intestinal microflora adhered on the mucosa. To improve the preparation yield, pre-coating the pipettes with FCS can be recommended.Let the pieces settle by gravity and gently aspirate the supernatant.Add 15 mL of cold PBS and repeat the rinsing procedure.",
    "Repeat these washing steps (i-iii) 3-5 times. The supernatant should be almost clear at the end of this procedure.Colonic tumor:Wash thoroughly. Use a pre-wet transfer pipette to pipette the pieces up and down (approximately 10 times). This step is crucial to remove the intestinal microflora adhered on the mucosa. To improve the preparation yield, pre-coating the pipettes with FCS can be recommended.Let the pieces settle by gravity and gently aspirate the supernatant.Add 15 mL of cold PBS and repeat the rinsing procedure.Repeat these washing steps (i-iii) 5-7 times. The supernatant should be almost clear at the end of this procedure.Note: The amount of washing steps might differ from person to person but, in any case, washes can be terminated when the supernatant is almost clear. Crypt and tumor cell isolationNormal small intestine:Aspirate the supernatant. Equilibrate with approximately 15 mL of 5 mM EDTA solution, remove the supernatant, add 15 mL of fresh EDTA solution, and incubate for 30 min on a benchtop roller at 4°C.Note: During incubation, checking for visible crypts in the supernatant, by pipetting a little drop onto a clean dish or microscope slide for examination under a phase-contrast microscope, can help to optimize incubation times at this step. Prepare 50 mL tubes under a sterile cell culture hood, add a cell strainer (100 µm pore diameter), equilibrate the filter by rinsing it with 10 mL of PBS, and let the PBS stay in the tubes.After 30 min EDTA incubation, use a sterile serological pipette to pipette up and down six times. Let the pieces settle by gravity and aspirate the supernatant as a first fraction.Note: Working quickly at these steps reduces EDTA-mediated toxicity on isolated crypts. Check for characteristic crypts using a phase-contrast microscope.",
    "Depending on the number of crypts present in the fraction, the first fraction can be either discarded or filtered through the cell strainer into the 50 mL tube containing ice cold PBS, to directly dilute the EDTA solution. Add 10 mL of ice-cold PBS to the intestinal pieces, pipette up and down several times, check for crypts using a microscope, and repeat filtering into the 50 mL tube for every fraction. Repeat until the tube is filled or until enough crypts have been isolated.Normal colon:Aspirate the supernatant. Equilibrate with approximately 10 mL of 4 mM EDTA solution, remove the supernatant, add 5 mL of fresh 4 mM EDTA solution, and incubate for 30 min on a benchtop roller at 4°C.Notes:  1) For colonic crypts, we achieved proper yield in viable and well-isolated crypts using 4 mM EDTA. However, for small intestinal crypts, 5 mM EDTA was needed for a proper crypt isolation in our hands. Concentrations of EDTA might even be increased up to 10 mM, depending on the yield of isolated crypts (Lukovac and Roeselers, 2015). The EDTA concentration needed might not just depend on the respective part of the gut, but also on the strength of mechanical disruption. 2) During incubation, checking for visible crypts in the supernatant, by pipetting a little drop onto a clean dish or microscope slide for examination under a phase-contrast microscope, can help to optimize incubation times at this step. Prepare 50 mL tubes under a sterile cell culture hood, add a cell strainer (100 µm pore diameter), and equilibrate the filter by rinsing it with 10 mL of PBS.After 30 min EDTA incubation, pipette up and down vigorously (approx. 10 times), and check the supernatant for crypt numbers in the first fraction.",
    "Usually, the number of colonic crypts in the first fraction from the EDTA solution supernatant is quite low, so the supernatant can be discarded. However, if there are many crypts present in the EDTA supernatant, the first fraction can be used.Add 10 mL of cold PBS to the intestinal pieces, pipette up and down vigorously (approximatelly 10-20 times), let the pieces settle by gravity, and aspirate the supernatant as a new fraction. Check for crypt numbers under the microscope. If an appropriate number of crypts is present, filter through a cell strainer under the cell culture hood into the fresh 50 mL tube containing 10 mL of cold PBS.Repeat step iv until the tube is filled or until enough crypts have been isolated. In case more crypts can be isolated from the pieces, use a new 50 mL tube.Colonic tumor:Aspirate the supernatant.Add 2 mL of 2 mg/mL Collagenase type I solution in Ad+ medium, incubate at 37°C for 20-30 min. Pipette the tissue pieces up and down every 10-15 min, using a transfer pipette to facilitate cell detachment.After 30 min incubation, add 10 mL of PBS, and pipette up and down vigorously until almost no bigger tumor pieces are left.Filter the suspension through a cell strainer into a new 50 mL tube.Work under sterile conditions from now on.In any case, if necessary, add up to 50 mL of ice-cold PBS to the tubes.Centrifuge tubes at 700 × g for 3 min at 4°C.Aspirate supernatants carefully.Add 10 mL of cold Ad+ medium and carefully suspend pellets.Centrifuge tubes again at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Aspirate the complete supernatants carefully and place tubes on ice.",
    "SeedingNote: The volume [µL] per Matrigel® dome is an approximate value or recommendation for routine cultivation, and can be adjusted to the specific experimental needs (Table 1). Table 1. Cell suspension with recommended Matrigel® and medium volumes for different plate formats. table:",

    "Notes:  1) For an optimal reduction of contamination risk, disinfect or sterilize all used tools before starting. 2) For an optimal reduction of contamination risk, all organoid culture media can be additionally supplemented with antifungal drugs, such as amphotericin, or combined antifungal/antibacterial drug solutions such as antibiotic-antimycotic (e.g., from Thermo Fisher). 3) Matrigel® should always be kept on ice or otherwise cooled. To minimize Matrigel® loss, pipette tips can be pre-cooled at -20°C. Add an appropriate volume of Matrigel® (Table 1) to the pellets and gently mix until pellets are completely dispersed. Avoid generating air bubbles in the Matrigel®. 4) Usually, after preparation of one mouse, enough crypts and tumors cells were isolated to culture 1-2 wells in a 6-well plate for crypts, and 2-3 wells in a 6-well plate for tumor cells. Seed 200 µL of the cell suspension per well in a pre-warmed 6-well plate (8 drops of 25 µL for one well). The number of wells depends on the isolation yield and the desired volume and cell density.Incubate at 37°C for approximately 30 min until the Matrigel® has solidified.Add 2 mL of pre-warmed organoid medium per well and cultivate under humidified atmosphere at 37°C with 5% CO2.Exchange medium every 2-3 days.Cultivate and treat according to your experimental needs.Note: Keep in mind that Matrigel® may retain treatment solutions. Medium and treatment traces in the domes cannot easily be washed away. Therefore, wash-out of treatment must be done thoroughly: After aspiration of the supernatant, perform an initial washing step with pre-warmed PBS. Add medium and incubate at 37°C for at least 30 min. Then, change medium again. Change medium again the next day, to further reduce treatment traces.",
    "Special considerations for seeding in 96-well plates:  Prepare 96-well flat bottom culture plates by prefilling the outer row of wells with PBS and pre-warming the plate in an incubator at 37°C.Dispense organoid suspension well (when passaging from a 50 mL tube, gentle shaking is sufficient).Continue with seeding. Seed 10 µL of organoid suspension per well. Seed the droplet into the center of the well carefully, to not touch the wall of the well. For beginners, precision can be improved by tapping the loaded pipette on the bottom of the well once without ejection for depth-orientation before seeding.Note: More volume will increase the number of organoids that can be used for experiments, but will also increase the risk of the droplet adhering to the wall of the well, which must then be excluded from analysis. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for every well, dispensing the suspension after every seeded well, to prevent unequal seeding densities.Carefully transfer plate into an incubator for 30 min to solidify the Matrigel®.Add 100 µL of culture medium per well (using a multi-channel pipette is recommended).Cultivate and treat according to your experimental needs.Notes: For aspiration of the supernatants in 96-well format, the following can be recommended:  1) Use the lowest power setting on the vacuum pump. 2) If the suction still damages the Matrigel® domes, the power can be further reduced by stacking plastic pipette tips. PassagingNote: Splitting is recommended after approximately 4-7 days, for small intestinal organoid culture, or after 6-8 days, for colonic and tumor organoid culture, with a splitting ration of 1:2 or 1:3, depending on seeding density and on the physical disruption before seeding. Aspirate media carefully from wells.Dissolve Matrigel® domes by adding ice-cold PBS to each well.Transfer the suspension to a 50 mL tube containing 5-10 mL of cold PBS.",
    "Rinse wells with ice-cold PBS again, if there is still Matrigel® with organoids left.Add up to 50 mL of ice-cold PBS.Centrifuge tubes at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.Aspirate supernatants carefully.Add 3 mL of ice-cold PBS, pipette up and down vigorously 20 times. For longer splitting intervals or for smaller fragments, pipette up and down 40 times with a 1 mL pipette. For optimal mechanical disruption with minimal destruction, place the blue pipette tip diagonally to the side of the tube bottom, not directly into the center. Alternatively, a 200 µL pipette tip attached onto a 5 mL serological pipette can be used for mechanical dissociation.Notes:  1) To enhance Matrigel® removal, incubation in 2 mL of cell recovery solution on ice for 10 min can be recommended after step 6. Centrifuge tubes at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C and aspirate supernatants. 2) If organoid fragments are still too big after step 7, organoids can also be dissociated by incubation in 4 mM EDTA solution for colon and 5 mM EDTA for small intestine, for 30 min on a roller at 4°C, followed by additional mechanical disruption. Add up to 50 mL of ice-cold PBS.Centrifuge tubes at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C.Aspirate supernatants carefully and place tubes on ice.Add 10 mL of cold Ad+ medium and carefully suspend pellets.Centrifuge tubes again at 500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Aspirate the complete supernatants carefully and place tubes with the cell pellet on ice.Continue with seeding as described in section B.Note: To verify that normal colon-derived organoids are not contaminated with tumor-derived organoids, one well of normal colon organoids can be seeded in parallel and cultured in the related organoid medium without Wnt3a conditioned medium.",
    "Whereas tumor organoids can grow without Wnt3a, normal colon organoids do not, which serves as a functional control. Furthermore, normal colon-derived organoids differ in their morphology from tumor-derived organoids. As seen in the graphical abstract, normal colonic-derived organoids (green) display a thicker and crypt-like epithelial layer, whereas tumor-derived organoids (red) are round with a thin epithelial layer."
