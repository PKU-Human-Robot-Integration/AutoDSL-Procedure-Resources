    "Day 1Pick a single colony from a plate, and inoculate an overnight culture of cells in 15 ml of synthetic media. Grow at 30 °C, 170 rpm in a shaker incubator. Do this 1-2 days beforehand, depending on growth rate of strain.Day 2Inoculate the overnight culture grown on day 1 into 110 ml of synthetic media supplemented with 250 nM biotin. Biotin is added to favor in vivo biotinylation of the tagged H3 proteins. The amount of cells to inoculate depends on growth rate (see below; typically, inoculate 3 OD units of cells of most X-Y strains into 110 ml media, which are then grown for 12 h). Grow at 30 °C, 170 rpm in a shaker incubator.Day3 Cross-linking H3 dimers with DMSHarvest at desired cell density. The desired cell density is 0.25 at OD600; don’t use more than 100 ml of cells at OD600 = 0.3 per Streptavidin-pull down described below, in order to assure that chromosomes are adequately digested with 20 μl MNase to generate mostly monosomes.Spin down cells in Swing bucket rotor at 2,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C. Gently pour off supernatant.Resuspend cells in 0.5 ml E buffer at 4 °C and transfer to a 1.5 ml O-ring screw-cap tube. Spin down in microfuge 20 sec at max speed at 4 °C. Remove supernatant.Wash 3 times with 1 ml E buffer by vortex. Spin down in microfuge 20 sec at max speed at 4 °C. Remove supernatant. Thorough washing is important here to remove amine-containing compounds that will impair crosslinking.Resuspend each tube of cells completely in 900 μl E buffer at 4 °C, and add 0.5 ml glass beads.Bead beat: 3 times of 1 min beating (2,100 rpm) in the Mini-Beadbeater-96 (5 min between pulses, on ice).",
    "Heat a 26 gauge needle with a gas burner (Figure 2A), and puncture the tube bottom with the red-hot needle (Figure 2B). Place into a 12 x 75 mm plastic tube (‘FACS tube’) (Figure 2C) and spin for 2 min at 365 x g in a tabletop centrifuge at 4 °C (Figure 2D). Discard screwcap tube with glass beads (Figure 2E).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180314/20180314031851_0245.jpgFigure 2. Step by step photos of the procedure Day 3, Step A7Resuspend pellet in the liquid (a mixture of E buffer and cell lysate on the bottom of FACS tube) completely, and transfer to a 1.5 ml microfuge tube. Make DMS stock 11 mg/ml in E buffer (typically 1 ml) at room temperature. This stock should be made freshly every time.Remove 0 min aliquot, 100 μl for SDS-PAGE. Add 1/10 volume 100% TCA. Incubate at room temperature for 10 min. Spin down in a microfuge for 10 min at max speed at room temperature. Remove supernatant, wash pellet with 1 ml of acetone at room temperature. Leave the lid open for 30 min to air-dry the pellet. Resuspend air dried pellet in 50 μl 2x SB. Store at -20 °C.Add 1/10 volume of 11 mg/ml DMS to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Incubate at room temperature with rotating for 60 min.Add 1/20 volume of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 to a final concentration of 50 mM for quenching the DMS crosslinking and further rotation for 15 min at room temperature. Remove 60 min aliquot, 100 μl for SDS-PAGE. Add 1/10 volume 100% TCA to the aliquot, process as above. Go next step (MNase digestion) immediately after the cross-linking.",
    "MNase digestionAdd 1/100 volume of 1 M MgCl2 to a final concentration of 10 mM (really 8 mM final, since E buffer contains 2 mM EDTA), and add 1/100 volume of 0.1 M CaCl2 to a final concentration of 1 mM to the DMS-crosslinked sample (the remaining amount after Step A-13, approximately 800 μl) at room temperature. Take 100 μl to generate an un-digested DNA sample for gel analysis. Store on ice.Equilibrate at 37 °C in a water bath for 5 min.Add 20 μl of MNase, invert the tubes 5 times and incubate at 37 °C for 20 min.Add 1/25 volume of 0.25 M EDTA/EGTA to a final concentration of 10 mM and invert 5-10 times to inhibit MNase. Take 100 μl to generate an MNase-digested DNA sample. Spin at 8,000 x g for 1 min, 4 °C, take supernatant for Streptavidin-pull down.Gel analysis of MNase digestionFor DNA purification, add 5 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml) to the 100 μl sample aliquots and incubate at 37 °C for 30 min.Add 5 μl of 20% SDS and 2 μl of Proteinase K (20 mg/ml). Incubate at 65 °C for 3 h.Add 200 μl of 7.5 M NH4Ac and 300 μl of ddH2O.Add 600 μl of PCI and vortex. Spin for 5 min in a microfuge at max speed.Take aqueous phase, and precipitate with 1 volume of 2-propanol.Spin down for 20 min at max speed at room temperature right after isopropanol precipitation.Wash pellet with 1 ml of 70% ethanol, spin for 5 min and air dry for 1 h.Resuspend pellet in 10 μl of TE.Add 2 μl of 6x loading buffer and run on 1.5% TAE agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide at 5 V/cm for 50 min.Streptavidin-pull downEquilibrate CL2B Sepharose beads with E buffer at 4 °C.",
    "To block the beads, add 10 μg insulin per 40 μl slurry for each sample, rotate for 30 min at 4 °C. Add MNase digested samples (described at Step B4) to 40 μl slurry preblocked CL2B Sepharose beads, rotate for 30-60 min at 4 °C.Spin at 8,000 x g for 1 min, 4 °C. Take 30 μl supernatant + 30 μl 2x SB as ‘Input’ sample. Store at -20 °C.Transfer the supernatant into a new 1.5 ml tube. Add 30 μl slurry streptavidin-Sepharose beads preblocked with insulin (use 10 μg insulin per 30 μl slurry for each sample, process as above), rotate 2 h at 4 °C.Spin at 8,000 x g for 1 min, 4 °C. Take 30 μl supernatant + 30 μl 2x SB as ‘Unbound’ sample.Wash beads three times with 1 ml W buffer at 4 °C, by rotating at 4 °C for 5 min each time. Spin at 8,000 x g for 1 min at 4 °C, then discard supernatant.After the last wash, remove all supernatant with a 26 gauge needle on a vacuum. Resuspend the beads in 50 μl 2x SB. Store at -20 °C.Western blotBoil samples at 100 °C for 10 min.Load 10 μl of 0 min and 60 min samples, 15 μl of Input samples and 8 μl of Bound samples. Run on 17% SDS-PAGE gels in 1x SDS-running buffer at constant 8 mA while bromophenol blue goes through the stacking gel, and 18 mA as it goes through the resolving gel. Continue running for 15 min after bromophenol blue runs off the bottom to improve the resolution of histones. Total run time is approximately 2 h.Transfer to Nitrocellulose membrane in blotting buffer at constant 0.5 A for 48 min.Block the membrane in 5% milk/TBST for 1 h at room temperature.",
    "Incubate membrane overnight at 4 °C with anti-V5 antibody (1:10,000 dilution in 5% milk/TBST). Wash the membrane three times each for 10 min with 5% milk/TBST.Incubate the membrane with secondary antibody (anti-Mouse IgG 1:15,000 dilution in 5% milk/TBST) at room temperature for 1 h.Wash the membrane three times each for 10 min with TBST.Remove the TBST and incubate the membrane with 1 ml ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) solution for 10 min.
