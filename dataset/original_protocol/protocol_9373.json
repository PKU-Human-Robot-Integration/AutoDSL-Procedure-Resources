    "1. Treatment of Cells and DNA Damage Induction\nCulture the human BCR-ABL+ B-cell acute lymphoblastic cell lines BV173 or SUP-B15 in IMDM supplemented with 20% FCS, 50 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Count cells and plate at 2 x 106 cell/mL in 6-wells plates, at 5 mL/well.\n\tNOTE: Optionally, suspension cell lines of various origin can used.\nTo arrest the BCR-ABL+ B-ALL cells in the G1-phase of the cell-cycle, add 5 μM of imatinib methanesulfonate (STI571), and incubate overnight.\nOptionally, omit this step when studying protein-protein interactions throughout the cell-cycle or in BCR-ABL-negative cell types.\nInduce DNA damage by adding 50 ng/mL neocarzinostatin (NCS) to the culture, and incubate for 2 h.\nAlternatively, induce DNA damage by irradiating the cells using a radioactive source [137Cs] at 0.5 Gy/min, at a dose of 5 Gy. After irradiation, let the cell recover for 2 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.\nOptionally, to assess the involvement of ATM kinase activity in response to DNA damage, add 5 μM of the ATM kinase inhibitor KU55933 prior to addition of NCS or the irradiation treatment.\nPrepare 1x PBS + 10% BSA by layering 5 g of fraction-V BSA on top of 50 mL of 1x PBS in a beaker or Erlenmeyer flask, and let sit at RT until BSA is dissolved. Do not shake or stir as this will cause extensive foaming. Slowly filter through a 0.22 μm filter and keep on ice.\nHarvest cells and wash twice with ice-cold 1x PBS. Count the cells and resuspend at 2 x 106/mL in 1x PBS + 10% BSA. Keep cells on ice.\n2. Cytocentrifugation, Fixation and Permeabilization",
    "Prepare the 4% paraformaldehyde solution in 1x PBS freshly. Add 2 g of PFA to 50 mL of 1x PBS and incubate in a 55 °C shaking water bath until the solution is clear. Filter the solution through a 0.22 μm filter and store at RT until use.\n\tNOTE: Optionally, 4% PFA fixative can be stored frozen at -20 °C. After freezing, thaw only once for use. Otherwise, the 4% PFA solution in PBS can be purchased directly.\nCarefully polish 76 mm x 26 mm microscopy slides with lint-free tissue and degrease them by placing in 96% ethanol in a Coplin jar for 5 min. Let the microscopy slides air-dry for 10 min.\nAssemble microscopy slides into the cytospin/cytology funnels with an area of 6 mm. Pre-coat slides by pipetting 50 μL of 1x PBS + 10% BSA into each funnel and centrifuge for 1 min at 500 rpm.\nAdd 100 μL of the cell-suspension (equaling 0.2 x 106 cells) to each funnel and centrifuge for 5 min at 500 rpm. For each antibody combination, at least 4 preparations are required (dual-antibody experiment; two single-antibody controls; no antibodies control).\nCarefully disassemble the funnels, and make sure not to touch the spots. Proceed to sample fixation immediately.\nOptionally, let slides air-dry for at least 30 min. After air-drying, wrap slides individually in aluminum foil and store at -20 °C until use. When using frozen preparations, make sure to thaw the slides wrapped in a paper towel to prevent overt condensation onto the slides.\nDraw a circle (approximate diameter 15-20 mm) around the spot using a PAP pen liquid blocker (5 mm tip).\nAdd 50 μL of 4% PFA fixation solution to each spot and incubate for 30 min at RT.",
    "Wash the cells 3 times for 5 min with 1x PBS in a Coplin jar at RT with gentle agitation.\nDry the slides around the spots with a lint-free tissue and remove as much liquid from the spot as possible using a pipet without touching the spot, or by tilting the slide. Add 50 μL of 0.25% Triton-X in 1x PBS to each spot and incubate for 10 min at RT without agitation.\nWash the slides 3 times for 5 min in ~50-60 mL of 0.05% Tween-20 in TBS (TBS-T) in a Coplin jar at RT with gentle agitation. 10 slides can be processed simultaneously in this fashion.\n3. Blocking and Primary Antibody Incubation\nTap off TBS-T and dry the slides around the spots with a lint-free tissue. Remove as much liquid from the spot as possible using a pipet without touching the spot, or by tilting the slide. Shortly vortex the blocking solution and add one drop (~ 40 μL) to each spot. Incubate for 1 h at 37 °C in a pre-warmed humidified chamber.\nPrepare the antibody cocktail by mixing the goat-anti-ATM at 1:1,000 and the rabbit-anti-phospho-Ser15-p53 at 1:100 in commercial antibody diluent, vortex antibody diluent before use. For control experiments, prepare antibody dilutions containing only the goat-anti-ATM and only the rabbit-anti-phospho-Ser15-p53 antibody (single-antibody controls).\nTap off the blocking solution but take care not to let the cells dry prior to adding the antibody dilutions. Add 30 μL of each antibody cocktail dilution and incubate in a humidified chamber overnight at 4 °C.\nPrepare in situ Wash Buffer A and Wash Buffer B by dissolving the content of one pouch of Buffer A and Buffer B mix in a final volume of 1,000 mL of water each.",
    "Alternatively, prepare wash buffer A by dissolving 8.8 g of NaCl, 1.2 g of Tris-base and 0.5 mL of Tween-20 in 800 mL water. Adjust pH to 7.4 using HCl and add to a final volume of 1,000 mL.\nAlternatively, prepare Wash Buffer B by dissolving 5.84 g of NaCl, 4.24 of Tris-base and 26.0 g of Tris-HCl in 500 mL of water. Adjust pH to 7.5 using HCl. Add water to a final volume of 1,000 mL.\nFilter both solutions through a 0.22 μm filter.\nWash the slides 2 times for 5 min with 1x in situ wash buffer A in a Coplin jar at RT with gentle agitation.\n4. PLA Probes, Ligation and Amplification\nPrepare PLA probes by diluting the anti-goat PLUS and anti-rabbit MINUS both 1:5 in the commercial antibody diluent. Tap off 1x in situ wash buffer A from the slides and add 30 μL of the PLA probe-mixture to each spot. Incubate 1 h at 37 °C in a pre-warmed humidified chamber.\n\tNOTE: Any combination of secondary antibodies PLUS and MINUS PLA probes can be used (anti-mouse, anti-rabbit, anti-goat), as long as the applied primary antibodies are raised in different species, and the combination of PLA probes should always contain a PLUS probe and a MINUS probe.\nWash slides 2 times for 5 min with ~50-60 mL 1x in situ wash buffer A in a Coplin jar at RT with gentle agitation.\nPrepare the Ligation-Ligase solution on ice by adding 1 μL of Ligase to 39 μL of Ligation solution and add 40 μL of Ligation-Ligase solution to each spot. Incubate 30 min at 37 °C in a pre-warmed humidified chamber.",
    "Wash the slides 2 times for 5 min with ~50-60 mL 1x in situ wash buffer A in a Coplin jar at RT with gentle agitation.\nPrepare the Amplification-Polymerase mixture on ice by diluting the Amplification stock solution 1:5 in water. Then add 0.5 μL of polymerase to 39.5 μL of 1x Amplification solution for each spot.\n\tNOTE: The amplification reagents are light sensitive and should be protected against direct exposure to light. The amplification reagent comes in four different colors (RED: excitation 594 nm, emission 624 nm; FarRED: excitation 644 nm, emission 669 nm; ORANGE: excitation 554 nm, emission 576 nm; GREEN: excitation 501 nm, emission 523 nm), make sure that the microscopy setup available has suitable excitation properties and filters to image these colors.\nTap off 1x in situ wash buffer A and add 40 μL of Amplification-Polymerase mixture per spot. Incubate for 100 min at 37 °C in a pre-warmed humidified chamber.\n5. Mounting and Imaging\nPrepare 0.01x in situ wash buffer B by adding 1 mL of 1x Wash Buffer B to 99 mL of water.\nTap off the Amplification-Polymerase mixture and wash slides 2 times for 10 min with 1x in situ wash buffer B in a Coplin jar at RT with gentle agitation.\nWash the slides 1 min in 0.01x wash buffer B.\nTap off excess 0.01x wash buffer B and dry the slides around the spots with a lint-free tissue. Remove as much liquid from the spot as possible using a pipet without touching the spot, or by tilting the slide.\nDilute DAPI-containing mounting medium 1:5 in mounting medium without DAPI to avoid overstaining of the nuclei.",
    "Add 25-30 μL of 1:5 DAPI-containing mounting medium to a 24 mm x 24 mm coverslip and pick up the cover slip with the slide, apply slight pressure to ensure that there are no trapped air bubbles. Seal the coverslip with nail polish and wait at least 15 min before imaging.\nAnalyze the slides using a (confocal) fluorescence microscope.\nCount the number of punctate PLA signals per cell in at least 4 acquired image fields (20x objective, counting at least 20 cells per condition or antibody combination, based on a power calculation using an anticipated mean of 7 ± 5 signals in the treated cells, and 2 ± 2 signals in the untreated cells, with a probability of a type-I error of 0.05, and a power of 80%, as reported previously15).\n\t\tNOTE: The best resolution is achieved by acquisition of a Z-stack and deconvolution using software packages (e.g., ImageJ, the Leica Acquisition Suite (LAS)). The signals should be readily discernible within the nuclear perimeter, as defined by the DAPI staining.\nDo not count signals that clearly appear outside the nuclei. Typically, NCS treatment or γ-irradiation results in approximately 5-10 phosho-p53/ATM PLA signals per cell. The 'single-antibody' controls may give some background signal, but this should not exceed 1-2 PLA signals per 1 out of every 20 cells.\nFor publication and presentation purposes, capture images using a 40X or 63X immersion oil objective. Slides can be stored at 4 °C and should be protected from exposure to light.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
