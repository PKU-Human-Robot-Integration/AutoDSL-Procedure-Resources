Blocking plates Prepare 100 mL of TBST 3% BSA for every 96-well deep well plate (Cole-Parmer) to be blocked. Transfer to reagent reservoir.Add 1 mL of TBST 3% BSA to each well of 96-well deep well plate.Blot top of plate with kimwipes to remove excess liquid.Seal plate well with MicroAmp optical adhesive film.Note: Plate may be sealed by pressing outward from the center of plate to eliminate large air bubbles, then by using a sealing paddle to eliminate all remaining air pockets. Invert plate several times to ensure the liquid is moving throughout the plate.Tape 96-well deep well plate to the plate rotator at 4°C and rotate end-over-end overnight.Phage-antibody complex formation (Video 3)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 3. Phage-antibody complex formation Thaw VirScan T7 phage library on ice. Characteristics of the library are shown in Table 1.Prepare 110 mL of diluted T7 phage library for each 96-well deep well plate.

    "Make aliquots of serum diluted to 0.2 μg/μL in PBS in 96-well PCR plates.Notes:  Concentration of IgG in human serum is generally 5–10 μg/μL. Dilute 2 μL of serum in 98 μL of PBS (1:50 dilution) to reach a concentration of approximately 0.2 μg/μL human IgG. Mix well. If needed, the concentration of IgG in a sample can be measured by IgG ELISA. Serum samples are typically run in duplicate. Eight no-serum controls are typically included for each run. Pour out blocking solution from 96-well deep well plates into sink. Flick plates several times to remove all blocking solution.Blot the surface of the plate with a kimwipe to remove liquid.Add 1 mL of diluted phage library to each well.Blot the surface of the plate with a kimwipe to remove excess liquid.Add sera containing 2 μg of IgG to each well, or 10 μL of the 0.2 μg/μL plate previously prepared.Blot the surface of the plate with a kimwipe to remove excess liquid.Seal plates extremely well with a new MicroAmp optical adhesive film, using a paddle. Make sure no air bubbles remain between wells.Invert plate several times to ensure that liquid is moving throughout the plate. Secure plates on rotator at 4°C and rotate with end-over-end mixing for 20 h or overnight.Seal plate with diluted serum samples and store at -80°C.Immunoprecipitation (Video 4)<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 4. Immunoprecipitation Centrifuge 96-well deep well plate at 500× g for 3 min to collect liquid away from seal.Tightly hold down plate while removing seal. Avoid splashing and cross-contamination between wells.Resuspend Protein A and Protein G Dynabeads by shaking bottles until there are no remaining beads settled at the bottom.",
    "For each 96-well deep well plate, add 2 mL of Protein A and 2 mL of Protein G Dynabeads to a reagent reservoir and mix with a serological pipette.Add 40 μL of Protein A/G to each well of the 96-well deep well plate.Blot the surface of the plate with a kimwipe to remove excess liquid.Seal plate with a new MicroAmp optical adhesive seals and tape plate to a rotator. Rotate for 4 h at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.Take one plate off at a time for washes. Centrifuge the 96-well deep well plate at 500 × g for 3 min to collect liquid away from the seal.Perform three washes using a liquid handling robot, as shown in Video 4, washing with 170 μL of PhIP-Seq Wash Buffer each time. At one point during the washes, transfer beads to a new 96-well deep well plate (Thermo Fisher) to avoid phage that may have bound non-specifically to the wells of the original plate. The Bravo protocol file is available in the Supplementary materials.Alternatively, perform washes manually.Place the plate on a magnetic separation rack.Let plate sit for 2 min to allow beads to collect. You should be able to see the solution become clear.Aspirate the liquid from each well. Switch tips after each well to avoid cross-contamination.When aspirating, make sure to hold the plate flush against the magnetic rods to avoid aspirating the beads.Note: Adjust the direction depending on where the magnetic rod sits relative to the wells. After aspirating the liquid from each row of wells, add 400 μL of PhIP-Seq Wash Buffer to the empty wells to prevent the beads from drying out.",
    "Remove the plate from the magnetic separation rack and use a multichannel pipettor to resuspend the beads in all the wells by pipetting up and down 10 times.Repeat steps i-iv for a total of three washes. During the first wash, transfer the beads to the new 96-well deep well plate.Cover the plate with a new MicroAmp optical adhesive seal and centrifuge the beads at 500 × g for 1 min. Aspirate any remaining liquid.Resuspend the beads in each well in 40 μL of sterile water and transfer to PCR plate. Seal plate.Spin PCR plate with resuspended beads in centrifuge for ~10 s, until centrifuge reaches 50 × g, to collect beads off the sides of the wells.Heat plate to 95°C for 10 min to lyse T7 phage.Store plate at -80°C for up to a week or proceed directly to library preparation for next-generation sequencing.Library preparation for next-generation sequencing (Video 5)Note: When setting up PCRs, keep PCR plate on aluminum block on ice at all times.

    "If a well fails to amplify by qPCR, run out the corresponding PCR1 and PCR2 products to diagnose the problem. If necessary, redo PCR1 and/or PCR2.Pool 2 μL of each sample of PCR2 in a reservoir, mix, and transfer to 1.5 mL microfuge tube.Notes:  Pool samples from individual plates separately. If sequencing input library, add 10× the volume of any given sample into the final pool, i.e., if pooling 2 μL of each sample, add 20 μL of the input library to the pool. Run 40 μL of pooled PCR2 products from each plate on a 2% agarose TAE gel.Gel extract correct size band using QIAgen Gel Extraction Kit.Notes:  The expected amplicon size for the T7 VirScan library is 376 bp. There may be a faint band directly below the correct-size band. Do not extract this faint lower band, as it contains products with truncated or missing Primer IS4 or Index Primer sequences. PCR purify gel-extracted samples using QIAquick PCR Purification kit.Note: PCR purification is performed after gel extraction to ensure greater purity of the sample prior to next-generation sequencing. Quantitate DNA using dsDNA HS Qubit assay, then pool equal amounts (ng) of each plate.Next-generation sequencingSubmit the pooled library for sequencing. The following sequencing parameters are required:Note: We generally sequence pooled libraries of 192 samples at a core facility with an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument and the NextSeq 500/550 High Output Kit v2.5 (75 Cycles), which yields ~400M reads. We order single-read, single-index sequencing, detailed below. Read 1: 75 cyclesNote: Only 50 cycles are required, but we typically order 75 cycles and truncate the reads during the Data Analysis steps.
