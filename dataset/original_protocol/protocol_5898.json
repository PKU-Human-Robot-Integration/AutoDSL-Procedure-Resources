    "Notes: Assemble behavioral training chamber according to the manufacturer’s instructions and optimize for your needs. Set up cameras and program the delivery of stimuli [odor(s), shock(s), air, vacuum, etc.] and duration of training and testing protocols into FreezeFrame by following the instructions provided with the software. This protocol will detail training and testing murine olfactory fear learning with a single odor, ethyl valerate (E5), but can be adapted to test multiple odors by adding additional odor vials and lines to the testing chamber (see Ross and Fletcher, 2018). It could be expanded for use with discriminate conditioning by adding additional odor vials and lines to the training chamber. Users can also add consecutive testing days to assess extinction if desired. Modify the training and testing chambersUse a drill to make a hole into one side of the training chamber for the vacuum line. The hole should be situated at the middle of the chamber between the shock floor and drop pan. Insert the 1/2” NPT male pipe adapter with 1/4” barb, which should fit snugly, into the drilled hole from the outside of the chamber and secure with a 1/2” NPT nut. The nut should be on the inside of the chamber and the barb should extend from the outside of the chamber (Figure 1B).Use a drill to make a second smaller hole in the opposite side of the training chamber for the odor line. The hole should also be situated at the middle of the chamber approximately 1/2-1” above the shock floor. Insert the 1/8” NPT male pipe adapter with 1/16” barb, which should fit snugly, into the drilled hole from the outside of the chamber and secure with a 1/8” NPT nut.",
    "The nut should be on the inside of the chamber, and the barb should extend from the outside of the chamber (Figure 1B).Place the testing chamber inside the isolation cubicle and run all tubing/cords through the holes on the back of the chamber to the inside (Figure 1C).Place the infrared light source inside the cubicle towards the side of the testing chamber that will not hold the mouse/the side that odorized air will enter the chamber. Situate to minimize glare on the chamber/camera by pointing the light source directly at a wall of the isolation cube rather than the camera or testing chamber (Figure 1C).Insert and thread the NPT end of the 1/2” NPT Male Adapter to 1/4” Hose Barb into one of the holes on the sides of the testing chamber. Attach the vacuum line to the barbed end (Figure 1).Assemble odor vial(s)Remove 16 G 1½ needles from individual packaging and lock a stopcock onto the female Luer side of each needle. If not already separated, remove the plastic cap from the 20 ml scintillation vial. Drill two holes into the top of the cap, leaving enough space between the holes for the needles with attached stopcocks. The holes should be as close to the size of the needles as possible. Secure the cap with drilled holes onto the bottle.Carefully uncap the needles and insert the beveled end through the holes on the cap, so that the needles are inside the bottle. Needles should fit snugly in drilled holes.Mix epoxy and apply to the cap of the bottle liberally to secure the needles to the cap. Make sure not to get epoxy on the stopcocks or the bottle itself. Let cure overnight.Use a sharpie to mark one of the stopcocks.",
    "This stopcock will act as the “odorized air” side of the odor vial. The other stopcock will receive non-odorized air from the Olfactory Stimulus Control. Cut a length of Kflex tubing that will fit your specific setup (long enough to stretch from bottles to chambers without excessive tension). In one end of the Kflex tubing, insert the 1/16” hose barb end of a male Luer. Attach the male end of the Luer to the top of the marked stopcock and attach the other end of the Kflex tubing to the training or testing chamber as desired.Notes: It can be difficult to detach tubing from barbed luers; therefore, is advantageous to have a separate length of tubing from the odor vial(s) to each chamber.  If using more than one odor for testing, Kflex tubing should be similar length for all odor vials to testing chamber. Multiple tubes can be secured to one another with parafilm and inserted into the hole on the side of the testing chamber.Assemble clean air and odorized air delivery systemAttach one end of the Masterflex Tygon tubing to one of the aquarium air pump outputs and the other end of the Tygon tubing to the input of the flowmeter. On a second piece of Tygon tubing, connect the 1/8” female Luer and cap it off with the corresponding male Luer lock plug. Attach the other end to the opposing flowmeter input.Attach one end of a short piece of the 1/16” Tygon tubing to the flowmeter output, in the other, place the Masterflex Y-connector. Cut two more pieces of the 1/16” Tygon tubing, approximately equal lengths, and join to the remaining barbs on the Y-connector. One of these lines will supply the air for the “clean air” line while the other will supply air for the “odor” line(s).",
    "The tubing designated for “clean air” should be paired with a Normally Open pinch valve with 1/16” ID tubing, while the tubing for the “odorized air” line should be paired with the Olfactory Stimulus Control. Fit the end of the “clean air” line with Luers to connect to the pinch valve tubing. Use a combination of 1/16” male and female Luers to adjoin (optionally, you can use straight barbed connectors with 1/16” barbs on both sides).After attaching the “odorized air” tubing to the back of the Olfactory Stimulus Control, connect another length of tubing to one of the three ports on top of the Olfactory Stimulus Control. Place a 1/16” male Luer to the other end of the tubing so that it can be connected directly to the unmarked stopcock on the odor vial(s).Wire the pinch valve to 2-Channel SPDT Relay Board, making sure to match the pinch valve type (NO or NC for Normally Open and Normally Closed, respectively) to the correct contact.Notes: For more information regarding wiring of relay boards, please refer to the schematics provided on the Winford website[href=https://www.winford.com/products/rly102.php]. In order to minimize noise emitted by the pinch valve during training and testing, we place the pinch valve inside a styrofoam or plastic (such as a used pipette tip) box with foam or styrofoam peanuts. We drill small holes in the side of the box for the pinch valve wires and mount the relay board to the top (lid) of the box. Using a combination of 1/16’ male and female Luers (or 1/16” straight barbed connectors), connect the remaining “clean air” pinch valve tubing to 1/16” Kflex tubing. Direct and attach this tubing to the training or testing chamber as needed.",
    "Note: Again, it may be advantageous to have separate “clean air” lines for the training and testing chambers that can be attached to the pinch valve separately.Assemble vacuum systemWire the 1/4” ID tubing pinch valve to a 2-Channel SPDT Relay Board (as before) and enclose in a container for noise reduction if desired.Fit one end of 1/4” ID Tygon tubing directly onto laboratory vacuum nozzle. Place a 1/4” straight barbed connector into the other end and attach directly to the pinch valve tubing.Place the second 1/4” straight barbed connector into the opposite end of the pinch valve tubing and connect it to another length of 1/4” ID Tygon tubing.Attach this end of the vacuum line to the training or testing chamber as needed.Note: It can be difficult to detach tubing from barbed connectors. Optionally, you can cut two lengths of 1/4” ID Tygon tubing and designate one for the training chamber and one for testing chamber. In this case, use a combination of 1/4” male and female Luers to join the pinch valve and vacuum tubing in Step D3. Attach each length of vacuum tubing to the appropriate chamber and connect to the pinch valve as needed. Program FreezeFrame protocols for stimulus deliveryOpen the FreezeFrame Recorder and create a training protocolNote: Refer to the FreezeFrame software manual[href=https://www.harvardapparatus.com/media/manuals/Product Manuals/FreezeFrame4 Manual.pdf] provided by Coulbourn for additional information regarding FreezeFrame setup. The training protocol should consist of 6 odor-shock pairings that occur every other minute starting in the second minute of the training protocol (Figure 2A). The odor presentations should last 10 sec each with the shock occurring 0.5 sec before the end of the odor presentation and lasting until the end of the odor presentation (i.e., Odor 60-70 sec, shock 69.5-70 sec; Odor 180-190 sec, shock 189.5-190 sec, etc.).",
    "Clean air and vacuum should be on at all times except during odor presentations (i.e., Clean air/vacuum 0-60 sec; 70-179 sec, etc.). Approximate training time = 720 sec.To test learned fear for just the training odor, the protocol should consist of 2 presentations of the conditioned odor (Figure 2B). Presentations should last for 20 sec every 240 sec starting in the second minute of the testing protocol (i.e., #1 60-80 sec; #2 300-320 sec). Clean air and vacuum should be on at all times except during odor presentations (i.e., Clean air/vacuum should be on from 0 sec to 59 sec and 120 sec to 299 sec but programmed to be off from 60 to 119 and 300 to 359)Note:The testing protocol can be adapted to increase the number of presentations and/or to test multiple odors. Adding epochs 240 sec apart with 20 sec presentations as needed. Remember, the clean air and vacuum lines are attached to NO pinch valves, meaning the trigger from the computer will signal to close the pinch valve, thus shutting the air and vacuum off. Prepare odor(s) for training/testingNote: Prepare odor(s) fresh daily. Empty any waste odorant into an appropriate container.Inside a fume hood, dilute E5 in mineral oil to ~200 ppm (64 μl E5 in 1,936 μl mineral oil) inside the odor vial. Gently shake to mix.Note: Any additional odorants should also be intensity matched to ~200 ppm, which will require different ratios of odor: mineral oil, to be determined by users.  Place the non-odorized air line (from the Olfactory Stimulus Control) on the unmarked stopcock and the “odorized air” Kflex tubing on the marked stopcock. Make sure to open stopcocks during training and testing when odor should reach chambers.Olfactory fear conditioning (training)Turn on humidifier and HEPA filter.",
    "If humidity is low, allow enough time before training to ensure humidity is > 35%. Leave both running throughout training.Ensure that the appropriate camera is plugged into the computer and open the FreezeFrame Recorder.Turn on vacuum, aquarium pump, pinch valves, and Precision Animal Shocker and make sure all necessary tubing is attached to the training chamber. Prepare fresh odor (above), attach necessary tubing, and open the stopcocks on the odor vial.Set the Shocker to deliver 0.8 mA shocks with 8 pole scanned output. Make sure that the shocker switch is positioned to “Remote” (under “Operate”) and “Subject.”Note: Other shock intensities may be used, to be determined by the user. We have elicited fear learning using 0.4 mA and 0.6 mA in addition to 0.8 mA. Use the Stimulus Configuration Panel under the Settings tab to ensure all stimuli are functioning and will be triggered appropriately during training.Select the training protocol from the dropdown menu.Specify a data file for storing data.Enter a unique name for each mouse (ideally this should relate to a physical identifier such as tail mark, ear punch, etc.) and take the reference frame.Note: If transporting mice from animal facility, allow at least 30 min before subjecting to training. Place mouse in the chamber and allow 5 min for habituation.Press start and observe mice during training for signs of shock experience (jumping, squeaking, increased freezing, etc.).Remove mouse after completion of training protocol and return to the cage.Note: We wait approximately 24 h after training before testing mice; however, different time points could be useful for determining short-term vs. long-term memory or retention. Clean training chamber with 1% Alconox solution and water, making sure to wipe down the shock floor and drop pan before starting next mouse.",
    "Olfactory fear testingEnsure that the appropriate camera is plugged into the computer and open the FreezeFrame Recorder.Turn on vacuum, aquarium pump, pinch valves, and infrared light and make sure all necessary tubing is attached to the testing chamber. Prepare fresh odor (above), attach necessary tubing, and open the stopcocks on the odor vial.Note: If using multiple odors during testing, move the non-odorized air line to each odor vial shortly before presenting that odor and open stopcocks. The non-odorized air line provides air to the odor vial that will become your odorized air for odor presentations. Make sure all stopcocks on other odor vials are closed when not being presented. Use the Stimulus Configuration Panel under the Settings tab to ensure all stimuli are functioning and will be triggered appropriately during testing.Select the testing protocol from the dropdown menu.Specify a data file for storing data.Enter the same unique name for each mouse as the previous day (to allow matching between training and testing data if desired) and take the reference frame.Note: If transporting mice from animal facility, allow at least 30 min before subjecting to training. Place mouse in the chamber and allow 5-10 min for habituation. During this time, observe mice for behaviors indicative of comfort and exploration, such as rearing and grooming. Mice that exhibit excessing freezing during the first minute of testing will be removed from the analysis (see below), so it is important to provide sufficient time during habituation for any novel context-induced freezing to subside.Press start and allow the mouse to complete testing protocol.Remove mouse after completion of training protocol and return to the cage.Clean testing chamber with 1% Alconox solution and water before starting next mouse."
