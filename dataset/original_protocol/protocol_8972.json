  "procedures": [
    "All procedures should be performed to the animal care standards set out by the institution.\n1. Dissection of the Abdominal Musculature from the Mouse\nBefore starting, make up 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Caution: Always keep PFA within a fume hood and wear appropriate protective equipment.\nEuthanize mouse by an approved method. Note: The mouse shown in the video was euthanized by overdose of CO2 and cervical dislocation. This mouse is a 4-week-old wild-type mouse on a CD1/C57Bl6 hybrid background. This mouse was bred in the animal facilities at the University of Ottawa from mice that were originally purchased.\nMake an initial incision through the skin at the level of the hip and cut through the skin all the way around the mouse.\nPeel off the skin, pulling upwards until you reach the level of the forelimb.\nCut through the abdominal musculature at the level of the hip and continue the incision until you reach the vertebral column.\nAt this point, start to cut upwards through the musculature and the ribs until you reach the upper limb.\nCut straight across until you reach the vertebral column on the other side.\nCut downwards until you reach the point at which you started.\nRelease the diaphragm from underneath (taking care not to damage the TVA muscle) and place it in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in a SYLGARD-coated dissection dish with 0.2 mm dissection pins.\nPin out the rib cage and associated musculature in the dish, superficial side up, making sure the muscle is fully stretched out.\nPour off the 1x PBS and replace with 4% PFA.\nCover and leave on a rocking platform at room temperature for 15 min.\nWash 3x in 1x PBS at room temperature for 10 min.",
    "* At this point the fixed muscles can be left in a fridge overnight before subsequent dissection.\n2. Isolation of the TVA Muscle\nTo proceed with isolation of the TVA muscle, under a dissection microscope, begin by cutting through the external oblique muscle at the level of the last few ribs (See Figure 1 for an annotated guide).\nCut straight down beside the linea alba (taking care not to cut through the TVA below) until you reach the start of the internal oblique muscle.\nThen cut across to release the overlying rectus abdominis and external oblique muscles from the upper part of the TVA below.\nRemove the blood vessel and any overlying fat from the TVA muscle.\nRelease the muscle from the overlying last rib.\nCut around the margins of the muscle and remove to a 24-well plate containing PBS.\n3. Immunofluorescent Labeling and Microscopy of the TVA Muscle\nFor all subsequent steps, remove liquid using a fine tipped pipette and leave the plate on a rocking platform. Unless otherwise stated, all subsequent steps are performed at room temperature.\nIncubate in PBS containing 1:1,000 fluorescently tagged bungarotoxin for 30 min to label the NMJs. This can be done in a dark room or under foil.\nPermeabilize muscle by adding 300 µl per well of 2% Triton X-100 in PBS and leave on a rocking platform for 30 min.\nIncubate in blocking reagent (4% BSA, 1% Triton in PBS) for 30 min.\nIncubate in blocking reagent containing primary antibodies (neurofilament 1:100; synaptic vesicle protein 2, 1:250) at 4 °C overnight.\nWash 3x in 1x PBS.\nIncubate in PBS containing 1:250 secondary antibody for 2-4 hr.\nWash 3x in 1x PBS.\nMount muscles onto glass slides using sufficient fluorescent mounting media and coverslip.",
    "Slides are best viewed using a double band pass filter on a standard epifluorescent microscope.\nNMJs are best imaged using a z-series projection on a confocal microscope equipped with at least a 40X objective."
