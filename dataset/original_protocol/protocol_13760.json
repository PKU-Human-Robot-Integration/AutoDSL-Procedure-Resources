    "NOTE: Studies related to the OP-IVM method have been approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Peking University Third Hospital and the Ethics Committee of Peking University (2014S2004). A summary of OP-IVM is shown in Figure 1. The step-by-step procedure will be introduced in the following section.\n1. Introduction of OP-IVM to appropriate patients\nIdentify potential patients who may benefit from OP-IVM such as those described in steps 1.1.1-1.1.3.:\n\t\nPolycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients with clomiphene resistance who need laparoscopic ovarian drilling surgery.\nInfertile patients who need benign gynecological surgeries, such as hysteroscopic myomectomy, polypectomy, transcervical resection of septum and laparoscopic tubal surgery, and oophorocystectomy, before ART treatment.\nPatients with cancer or hematological disease who are receiving chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy.\n2. Informed consent\nProvide full information to patients, including why OP-IVM may be beneficial, its procedure, uses of IVM oocytes (IVF-ET or cryopreservation), estimated CPRs and LBRs, and possible complications. Ask patients to give informed consent by signing the consent form.\n3. Prepare labels and IVM oocyte medium\nPrint identification (ID) labels with the patient's name and dates for culture dishes and tubes.\nAdd 0.5 mL of IVM medium supplemented with 0.75 IU/mL of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and 0.75 IU/mL of luteinizing hormone (LH) to each well of a 4-well plate. Cover the medium with oil.\n\tNOTE: Perform all these procedures in laminar flow clean benches.\nPrewarm the 4-well plate with IVM oocyte medium at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2 and 5% O2 at least 6 h before use.\n4. Administer anesthesia in an operating room\nCheck the name of the patient before administering anesthesia.\nIntravenously anesthetize the patient by anesthesiologist.\n5. Perform oocyte retrieval\nTag the labels with name, date, and ID on the culture dishes and tubes.",
    "Place the patient in the bladder lithotomy position; constantly disinfect, drape, and scrub the vagina with warm saline.\nPlace the ultrasound probe inside the vagina; scan and record the number of follicles in both ovaries. Find the location closest to the ovary as the puncture site, and avoid the intestine, bladder, and large blood vessels.\nAspirate follicular fluid.\n\t\nWash the needle with pH-stable handling medium before puncturing (see Table of Materials).\nInject the 19 G, single-lumen aspiration needle into the ovaries under the guidance of ultrasound.\nPuncture larger follicles with clear boundaries closest to the probe. At a low position, quickly inject the rinse solution supplemented with 25 U/mL of heparin. Aspirate follicular fluid with the needle under a pressure of 80-90 mmHg, rotating the needle slightly to aspirate as much follicular fluid as possible. Puncture other follicles from the near to far side on this plane.\n\t\tNOTE: During aspiration, follicular fluid containing oocytes will flow into a sterile 10 mL test tube under negative pressure. Heparin can reduce the follicular fluid viscosity to facilitate the aspiration process.\nRemove the needle from the ovary (keep the needle in the vaginal wall). Adjust the direction of the ultrasound probe, and puncture the remaining follicles on other planes. Try to aspirate all the follicles with a diameter of ~5-9 mm.\n\t\t​NOTE: Adjust the probe's position to keep it closest to the ovaries at all times. Press the vaginal fornix with appropriate force to reduce injury and bleeding.\nPull out the needle after finishing in one ovary, wash the needle with the handling medium, and puncture the other side using the same method.\n\t\tNOTE: Complete follicle aspiration within 25-30 min.\nTransfer the follicular fluid from the operation room to the IVF laboratory within a few minutes after confirming the patient's name and ID.",
    "NOTE: Transfer aspirated follicular fluid to the IVF laboratory bench as soon as possible to prevent coagulation.\nDetect active hemorrhage in the pelvic cavity with B-mode ultrasound after puncturing all the follicles. Insert a speculum, and point the tip at the posterior fornix to detect active bleeding at the puncture site.\n\t​NOTE: No active bleeding should be observed at the vaginal puncture site if the ovary position is normal and oocyte retrieval is performed carefully. For light bleeding that continues even after compression, keep a sterile gauze compress in the vagina for 2-4 h. Control excessive bleeding from small arteries using clamps with vascular forceps for 2-4 h. Bleeding in the pelvic cavity or ovary, which seldom happens, should be controlled by electrocoagulation by laparoscopic surgery.\n6. Gynecological surgery\nBased on the need and condition of the patient, perform appropriate gynecological surgery after oocyte retrieval.\n\t\nPerform laparoscopic ovarian drilling surgery for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients with clomiphene resistance.\nPerform benign gynecological surgery for infertile patients before ART treatment, such as hysteroscopic myomectomy, polypectomy, transcervical resection of septum and laparoscopic tubal surgery, and oophorocystectomy.\nPerform ovariectomy for fertility cryopreservation of patients with cancer or hematological disease who need to receive chemoradiotherapy.\n\t\t​NOTE: These gynecological surgeries are basic and standardized clinical operations. Operation guidelines in various countries and hospitals should be relatively similar.\n7. Perform IVM\nNOTE: Perform the whole process of IVM on a 37 °C homothermal flat.\nFilter the aspirated follicle fluid with a 70 µm nylon cell strainer. Repeatedly rinse the culture tube and strainer with pre-warmed pH-stable handling medium. Ensure all the immature COCs are completely transferred to the culture dish. Collect the filtered fluid , rinse, and culture in a 100 x 15 mm Petri dish.",
    "Examine the COCs (Figure 2) under the stereoscope with 40x magnification. Quickly transfer the immatures into a pre-warmed IVM oocyte medium.\n\t​NOTE: Choose an appropriate magnification depending on the operator's habit.\nRecord the number of cultured immature COCs.\nInform the patient about the number of cultured COCs. Discuss the collection of semen with the patients and their partners. Perform sperm extraction according to the normal procedure.\nCulture the immature COCs at 37 °C in humidified air containing 5% CO2 and 5% O2 for 28-32 h.\nAssess the oocyte maturity.\n\t\nDenude the cumulus cells by repeated pipetting using a glass Pasteur pipette under the stereoscope with 40x magnification. Examine the extrusion of the polar body (PB) to identify the developmental stage of the oocytes. See Figure 2 for representative images of oocytes in COCs, metaphase II (MII), metaphase I (MI), and germinal vesicles (GVs) with clear morphological characteristics.\n\t\tNOTE: Use a vertical flame (e.g., of a Bunsen burner) to adjust the diameter of the glass Pasteur pipette to the size of an oocyte.\nCount MII oocytes and record the number.\nChoose mature oocytes for IVF or vitrification.\n\t\t​NOTE: Collect sperm on the day the oocytes mature for IVF, but not for oocyte vitrification.\nCulture the immature oocytes in GV and MI stage in the original IVM culture medium with cumulus cells for another 10-14 h. Repeat steps 7.6.2-7.6.3.\n8. Perform ICSI or oocyte vitrification\nFollow the standard procedure of the reproductive center8.\n9. Culture embryos and perform embryo cryopreservation\nFollow the standard procedure of the reproductive center8.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
