    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nExpression of recombinant PELO protein\nTiming: 2+ days\nThis section outlines procedures to express recombinant PELO protein in E. coli.\nPrepare LB media containing 30 μg/mL kanamycin.\nInoculate 5 mL of LB media in a 50 mL tube with a single colony by using a sterile pipette tip.\nMake sure the tube lid is attached loosely to ensure adequate air exchange of the culture.\nGrow the pre-culture at 37°C for 8–12 h with shaking at 220 rpm.\nAdd 1 mL of the culture to 50 mL of LB media in a 250 mL conical flask.\nCultivate the culture at 37°C with continuous shaking at 220 rpm and regularly monitor OD600 of the culture.\nTake the flask out of the shaking incubator and transfer it onto ice for 10 min once the culture attains 0.8–1.0 (typically within 3–5 h).\nCritical: The OD600 of culture should not exceed 2.0 before adding IPTG.\nAdd IPTG to the chilled culture (25 μL of 1 M stock for 50 mL culture, final concentration 0.5 mM).\nReturn the culture flask to the incubator and enable the expression to continue for 12–18 h at 25°C with shaking at 200 rpm.\nHarvest bacteria.\nCollect cultures to a 50 mL tube and centrifuge at 6,000 × rpm for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and wash the cell pellets with 10 mL 1× PBS.\nRepeat the centrifugation step (6,000 × rpm for 5 min). Remove supernatants.\nPause point: Bacterial pellets can be frozen down and stored at −80°C for several months before proceeding with lysis.\nPurification of recombinant PELO protein\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step describes the details of how to purify recombinant PELO protein.",
    "Use 10 mL of protein lysis buffer to resuspend bacterial pellet (∼2 mL of lysis buffer is needed per 10 mL of expression culture).\nCritical: Perform all steps below at 4°C and with chilled reagents.\nSonicate to lyse the bacteria on ice by using Ultrasonic Homogenizer (Scientz-IlD, Scientz) (35% intensity, 3 s pulses on/off, for 5 min).\nRemove the cell debris by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 30 min, 4°C).\nTransfer the clarified supernatants to a 15 mL tube.\nTransfer 0.5 mL of Ni-NTA agarose beads (∼ 1.0 mL of slurry) into a 15 mL tube.\nWash beads using 10 mL of lysis buffer three times.\nIntroduce the Ni-NTA beads into the clarified lysate and incubate at 4°C for 2 h with gentle rotary agitation. The Ni-NTA agarose beads will capture the His-tagged target protein.\nCollect the beads (4°C, 1,000 × g, 3 min) and discard the supernatant. Wash beads with 10 mL of protein wash buffer three times.\nElute the bound proteins from the beads by incubation with 0.5 mL elution buffer for 10 min. Repeat this step three times.\nCollect eluates and further purify the protein by standard size-exclusion chromatography with Superdex 200 10/300 GL prepacked filtration column.\nFlush the column with 1.5 column volumes of ddH2O to remove the storage solution. Set flow rate to 0.5 mL/min. For Superdex 200 10/300 GL, the column volume is 24 mL and the maximum pressure limit is 1.5 MPa.\nEquilibrate the column with 1.5 column volumes of protein wash buffer at 0.5 mL/min.\nSet the 1.0 mL sample loop state to \"Load\" in the FPLC system. Inject protein wash buffer, whose volume is equivalent to twice of the sample loop, into the sample loop. Repeat the injection twice.",
    "Centrifuge the protein elute at 10,000 g and 4°C for 10 min. Inject the protein solution into the sample loop.\nSet sample loop state to \"Inject\" in the FPLC system. Elute with 1 column volume of protein wash buffer and collect the fractions with the expected volume. We collected the eluates ranging from 7.85 to 23.85 mL at 1 mL per fraction.\nRun SDS-PAGE and stain gel using Coomassie blue R-250 to identify fractions that contain target protein. The targeted protein is mainly eluted between 13.85 to 15.85 mL (Fraction 7&8).\nPool peak fractions containing target protein.\nUse Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter unit with a 10 kDa size cutoff to concentrate pooled fractions (4°C, 5,000 × g, several 5 min spins).\nDetermine the protein concentration by using the BCA method.\nNote: In case of low protein concentration (< 0.2 mg/mL), you can return to step 21 to further concentrate the protein solution.\nAliquot concentrated protein solution into PCR tubes (5 μL or 2 μg aliquot). Snap freeze in liquid nitrogen and store the solution at −80°C.\nPause point: The purified recombinant PELO protein can be kept at −80°C for several months.\nExpression and purification of recombinant flagellin protein\nTiming: 2 days\nThe role of purified recombinant flagellin protein as a ligand is indispensable for the in vitro NAIP5-NLRC4 inflammasome reconstitution; in this specific protocol, recombinant L. pneumophila flagellin fused to the B. anthracis lethal factor (LF) can be produced and purified following the same procedures outlined above for recombinant PELO protein.\nPreparation of native cell lysate containing NAIP5-NLRC4\nTiming: 2 h\nThis step elaborates on the details of preparing NAIP5-NLRC4 containing native cell lysate.\nResuspend NAIP5-NLRC4 expressing HEK293T cell pellet in 200 μL 1× Native lysis buffer containing 1% digitonin and fresh protease inhibitor cocktail.",
    "Critical: Cool all the reagents before use and all the following steps should be performed on ice.\nCritical: The volume of native lysis buffer required to lyse the cells may vary depending on different NLRs expression levels. In our case, the amount of NLRC4 protein in the whole cell lysate from one well of HEK293T cells is about 1 μg. High concentration (> 10 μg/mL) of NLRC4 in the whole cell lysate will lead to ligand-independent formation of NLRC4 self-aggregate.\nNote: Detergents used in native lysis buffer should be determined empirically. Digitonin (0.5–1.0%) works well, but other regular detergent also can be used: Triton X-100 (0.1%–0.5%), dodecylmaltoside (0.1%–0.5%), Brij 96 (0.1%–0.5%).5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nUse 200 μL pipette to triturate per sample 10 times. Repeat 3 times over 30 min at 4°C.\nCentrifuge samples at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nCollect the clarified supernatants to fresh cold 1.5 mL tubes with caution and discard the cell pellet.\nDetermine the total protein concentration per sample by using BCA method and adjust the samples with 1× Native lysis buffer to equalize the total protein between samples.\nCritical: Whenever feasible, utilize native lysates on the same day when they are collected to prevent freeze and thaw cycles.\nPerform in vitro assembly of NAIP5-NLRC4 inflammasome\nTiming: 2 h\nHere we provide procedures for conducting an in vitro assembly of flagellin-dependent NAIP5-NLRC4 inflammasome.\nRemove one aliquot of recombinant PELO and flagellin protein from the freezer and allow it to thaw on ice.\nCritical: Avoid freeze and thaw cycles of the recombinant protein to maintain its activity. To ensure reliable outcomes, use a new portion of the protein for each experiment.\nNote: Ensure the protein activity remains during the process of assay preparation by keeping protein solutions and buffers on ice.",
    "Prepare a water bath in advance to a steady temperature of 37°C.\nMix 10 μL of NAIP5-NLRC4 lysates with ATP (0.2 mM) + Mg2+ (2 mM), 200 ng flagellin, 100 ng PELO in various combinations in a total volume of 20 μL.\nNote: We usually prepare 10×solution: ATP (2 mM)+Mg2+ (20 mM), aliquot and store it at −20°C. Take out and thaw it before use.\nIncubate the mixture at 37°C water bath for 1 h.\nNote: The incubation period may vary depending on the concentration of the NLRs in the reaction mixture.\nCentrifuge samples at 4°C (20,000 × g, for 10 min) to eliminate potential protein aggregates.\nTransfer the supernatant carefully to pre-chilled PCR tubes on ice.\nCritical: Native samples should be run the day they are collected and freeze–thaw of samples should be avoided.\nAnalysis of the NAIP5-NLRC4 inflammasome by blue-native PAGE and immunoblotting\nTiming: 2 days\nBlue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) is a powerful method to separate intact protein complexes by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6] The protein mixtures can be separated based on the molecular size of polyacrylamide gradient gels by using the dye Coomassie blue G-250, which imparts a net negative charge to proteins and at the same time preserves native protein conformation and interactions.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] Previous reports and our results have successfully used BN-PAGE to assess the NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome complex in stimulated cells.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1],4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]\nThis step describes how to perform BN-PAGE to analyze the assembled NAIP5-NLRC4 inflammasome in vitro.\nMix 1.5 μL of 2.5% Coomassie blue G-250 sample additive with 13.5 μL of the final reaction mixture from step 34 to prepare samples for Native PAGE.\nNote: The concentration of G-250 should be 1/4th the detergent concentration. For example, if the digitonin concentration is 1% in the samples, the final concentration of G-250 required is 0.25%.",
    "Remove the white tape near the bottom of the 3%–12% NativePAGE minigel cassettes and carefully extract the comb to avoid any harm to the lane dividers. Flush gel wells twice with 1× Native running buffer before loading samples.\nCritical: Invitrogen offers NativePAGE minigels as precast gels with gradients of 3%–12% and 4%–16%. Choose the proper gels for analysis of the complex of interest. For example, the 4%–16% gels cannot achieve efficient separation of ∼1,200 kDa complexes such as NAIP5-NLRC4 inflammasome. In contrast, the 3%–12% gels allow for separation of protein complexes in such a size. So, in this protocol, 3%–12% gel should be used to analyze NAIP5-NLRC4 inflammasome.\nPut the gels in the gel running tank, and load 1× Native dark-blue cathode buffer into the gel wells.\nLoad 10 μL of prepared samples into each well and load 5 μL of NativeMark protein standard as marker. Denature the reminding samples with SDS sample buffer and run SDS-PAGE for control.\nNote: To facilitate the observation of the sample wells, load samples into sample wells before filling the cathode chamber. Invitrogen NativePAGE minigels are offered as precast in 10-well and 15-well format and 1.0 mm thickness. The loading volume should not exceed 15 μL for 15-well gels.\nFill the inner buffer chamber with ∼200 mL 1× Native dark-blue cathode buffer, and fill the outer chamber with ∼500 mL 1× Native running buffer.\nRun the gel at 150 V for 20 min. The initial current should be ∼ 18 mA per gel.\nPause the run and carefully replace the dark-blue cathode buffer with 1× light-blue cathode buffer.",
    "Critical: For western blotting applications, as excessive dye will block the PVDF membrane during protein transfer, the cathode buffer should be changed from “dark” to “light” after the dye front has migrated about 1/3 of the way through the gel to flush excess dye from the gels.\nContinue the run at 150 V for another 90 min. The current should end at ∼2 mA per gel.\nDisassemble the gel apparatus. Use metal spatula to remove the plastic casing from the gel. Carefully trim the gel ∼1 mm below the well bottom and cut off the gel foot.\nNote: The marker lane can be cut off from the gel and visualized by Coomassie blue staining. Alternatively, the 1,246 and 1,038 kDa markers can be observed through background reaction with secondary antibody during exposure.\nTransfer the trimmed gel to a plastic tray. Equilibrate the gel in 10% SDS solution with shaking for 10 min, and then wash with Native transfer buffer twice (1 min each).\nCritical: To avoid tearing the gel, ensure to lift it from the 12% foot, not the 3% wells.\nNote: Protein complexes can be completely denatured by SDS prior to transfer, releasing all available epitopes for immunodetection by antibody.\nTransfer proteins to PVDF membrane using standard wet transfer protocol.\nActivate the PVDF membranes with 100% methanol for 1 min and rinse with transfer buffer.\nDisassembly the gel and construct the gel “sandwich” in the transfer cassette.\nClamp tightly together to avoid air bubbles between any of the layers.\nLoad a cassette into the wet/tank transfer apparatus.\nTransfer at 100 V for 1 h at 4°C.\nRinse the membrane with pure methanol 3 times (5 min each) to destain the Coomassie blue G-250, then wash the membrane with TBST buffer three times, 5 min each.",
    "Critical: Destaining is very important since Coomassie blue G-250 might interfere with antibody recognition in the following western-blot.\nTo block the PVDF membrane, incubate it in TBST + 5% BSA for 1 h at RT while gently shaking, followed by standard western-blot protocol. We probe the membrane with anti-HA antibody at RT for 3 h to detect the monomeric and oligomeric NLRC4.\nAlternatives: TBST + 5% milk is also suitable for blocking."
