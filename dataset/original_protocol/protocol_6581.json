Express and purify GST-TEV-FUS protein from E. coli BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL cells (Agilent) as follow.Grow FUS-expressing cells in 6 L of Lennox Broth (LB) at 37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm until the OD600 is between 0.4-0.6. Induce cells with 1 ml of 1 M IPTG (final conc. 1 mM IPTG), then grow overnight at 15 °C with shaking at 250 rpm.Spin cells down at 4,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C.
