    "All radioactive reagents and procedures were handled in accordance with local Utrecht University radiation rules and regulations.\n1. Pulse Chase\nPulse Chase for Adherent Cells\n\tNOTE: The volumes given here are based on 60 mm cell culture dishes. For 35 mm or 100 mm dishes, multiply the volumes by 1/2 or 2, respectively. This protocol uses a pulse time of 10 min and chase times of 0, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min. These can be varied depending on the specific proteins being studied (discussed below).\n\t\nSeed adherent cells (e.g., HEK 293, HeLa, CHO) in six 60 mm cell culture dishes so that they will be subconfluent (80% - 90%) on the day of the pulse chase. Use at least one dish per time point and/or condition.\nIf required, transfect the cells with commercially available transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions; or, virally transduce8 the cells 1 day before the pulse-chase experiment with the appropriate construct for expression.\nWash the dishes with 2 mL of wash buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution [HBSS]), add 2 mL of starvation medium (normal culture medium lacking methionine and cysteine and fetal bovine serum [FBS], such as minimum essential medium [MEM] without methionine and cysteine but with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), and place the dishes in a 37 °C humidified incubator with 5% CO2 for 15 min.\nTransfer the dishes to the racks in a prewarmed 37 °C water bath so that they are in contact with water but do not float. Start a timer.",
    "At 40 s, aspirate the starvation medium, draw up 600 µL of pulse solution (starvation media + 55 µCi/35 mm dish label, see the note preceding step 1.1.1) into the pipette, and add it gently to the center of the dish at exactly 1 min. Repeat this step at 1 min intervals for the remaining dishes. Start with the longest chase sample to save time during your experiment.\n\t\tNOTE: When handling radioactive material, it is essential to follow appropriate precautions and local rules and regulations to prevent accidental exposure and/or contamination.\nAt exactly 11 min and for all following dishes, except for the 0 min chase sample, add 2 mL of chase medium directly to the dish, aspirate it, and again, add 2 mL of chase medium. Repeat this step at 1 min intervals for remaining dishes. Transfer all dishes to a 37 °C incubator.\nAt exactly 16 min, add 2 mL of chase medium (normal culture medium + 10 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 5 mM cysteine, and 5 mM methionine) directly to the 0 min sample dish on top of the pulse medium to stop labeling; then, aspirate immediately, transfer the dish to a cooled aluminum plate, and add 2 mL of ice-cold stop buffer (HBSS + 20 mM N-ethylmaleimide [NEM]).\n\t\tNOTE: This is the 0 min chase sample. For this sample, proceed directly to step 1.1.9.\nTransfer each chase dish back to the water bath 2 min before each chase time (e.g., 24 min for a 15 min chase) and, at the exact chase time (e.g., 26 min for a 15 min chase), aspirate the chase media (or transfer it to a microcentrifuge tube if following protein secretion) and transfer the dish to a cooled aluminum plate. Add 2 mL of ice-cold stop buffer.",
    "Incubate all dishes on ice in the stop buffer for ≥5 min; then, aspirate the stop solution and wash it with 2 mL of ice-cold stop solution. Aspirate the wash and lyse dishes with 600 µL of lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] + nondenaturing detergent [see Table of Materials] + protease inhibitors + 20 mM NEM). Use a cell scraper to ensure that the dishes are lysed quantitatively.\nTransfer the lysate to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge for 10 min at 15,000 - 20,000 x g and 4 °C to pellet the nuclei.\nPulse Chase for Suspension Cells\n\tNOTE: To ensure efficient labeling, cells should be pulsed at a concentration of 3 x 106 to 5 x 106 cells/mL, and chase volumes should be 4x the pulse volume. In the following example, we pulsed 5 x 106 cells in a volume of 1 mL for 10 min, to yield five chase time points (0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min) of 1 mL, containing 1 x 106 cells per time point. All solutions are the same as in section 1.1.\n\t\nCulture the suspension cells (e.g., 3T3, Jurkat) according to a previously published protocol9 so that there is a sufficient number of cells at the time of the experiment, at least 1 x 106 cells per time point and/or condition.\nIf required, transfect cells with commercially available transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions, or virally transduce8 the cells 1 day before the pulse-chase experiment with the appropriate construct for expression.\nPellet 5 x 106 cells per condition in a 50 mL tube for 5 min at 250 x g at room temperature, wash them 1x with 5 mL of starvation media, pellet them again, and resuspend them in 1 mL of starvation media.",
    "Transfer the cells to a 37 °C water bath and incubate them for 10 - 25 min. Agitate the tubes every 10 - 15 min to prevent the cells from settling at the bottom.\nStart the timer. At exactly 1 min, add 275 µCi (55 µCi/1 x 106 cells) of undiluted label directly to the tube containing cells and swirl to mix.\n\t\tNOTE: When handling radioactive material, it is essential to follow appropriate precautions and local rules and regulations to prevent accidental exposure and/or contamination.\nAt exactly 11 min, stop labeling by adding 4 mL of chase media. Mix the sample and immediately transfer 1 mL to a 15 mL tube on ice, containing 9 mL of ice-cold stop solution.\n\t\tNOTE: This is the 0 min chase sample.\nRepeat these steps for each successive time point. Once all time points are collected, pellet the cells for 5 min at 250 x g at 4 °C. Aspirate the medium (or transfer it to a new 15 mL tube if following protein secretion). Wash the cells with 5 mL of stop solution and pellet the cells for 5 min at 250 x g at 4 °C.\nAspirate the stop solution, completely lyse the cells with 300 µL of ice-cold lysis buffer and incubate them for 20 min on ice to ensure a complete lysis. Transfer the lysate to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and centrifuge for 10 min at 15,000 - 20,000 x g at 4 °C to pellet the nuclei.\n2. Immunoprecipitation\nCombine antibody (see the discussion) and 50 µL of immunoprecipitation beads (e.g., protein A-Sepharose) (10% suspension [v/v] in lysis buffer + 0.25% bovine serum albumin [BSA]) in a microcentrifuge tube and incubate them at 4 °C for ~30 min in a shaker.",
    "Pellet the beads for 1 min at 12,000 x g at room temperature and aspirate the supernatant. Add 200 µL of lysate to the antibody-bead mixture and incubate at 4 °C in a shaker for 1 h or head-over-head if the immunoprecipitation requires >1 h.\nPellet the beads for 1 min at 12,000 x g at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant and add 1 mL of immunoprecipitation wash buffer. Place the sample in a shaker at room temperature for 5 min.\nPellet the beads as described in step 2.3 and repeat the wash 1x. Then, aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the beads in 20 µL of TE buffer, pH 6.8 (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA). Vortex the sample.\nAdd 20 µL of 2x sample buffer without the reducing agent, vortex it, heat it for 5 min at 95 °C, and vortex again.\n\tNOTE: If only preparing reducing samples, 2 µL of 500 mM DTT should be added at this point. Then, proceed to step 2.7.\nPellet the beads as described in step 2.3. Transfer 19 µL of the nonreduced supernatant to a fresh microcentrifuge tube containing 1 µL of 500 mM DTT, centrifuge the sample, and vortex it before heating it for 5 min at 95 °C again.\nSpin down the sample for 1 min at 12,000 x g; this is the reduced sample. Cool it down to room temperature and add 1.1 µL of 1 M NEM to both the reduced and the nonreduced sample. Vortex and spin down the samples.\n3. SDS-PAGE\nFirst, determine the appropriate SDS-PAGE resolving gel percentage for the protein of interest. For example, HIV-1 gp120, when deglycosylated, runs at ~60 kDa and is analyzed in a 7.5% gel.",
    "Prepare the resolving gel mixture without TEMED according to the manufacturer's instructions (x% acrylamide, 375 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.8,] 0.1% SDS [w/v], and 0.05% ammonium persulfate [APS] [w/v]) and degas under vacuum for >15 min. While the gel mixture is degassing, thoroughly clean the gel glass plates with 70% ethanol and lint-free tissues and place them into a casting apparatus.\nAdd TEMED to the resolving gel mixture (at a final concentration of 0.005% [v/v]), mix thoroughly, and pipette between glass plates, leaving ~1.5 cm space for the stacking gel. Carefully overlay the gel with deionized H2O or isopropanol and leave it to polymerize.\nOnce the resolving gel has polymerized, prepare the stacking gel mixture (4% acrylamide, 125 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 0.1% SDS [w/v], and 0.025% APS [w/v]).\nFlush the top of the resolving gel with deionized H2O and, then, remove all water.\n\tNOTE: Use filter paper to remove the last drops.\nAdd TEMED to the stacking gel mixture (0.005% [v/v]), mix thoroughly, and overlay the resolving gel with stacking gel and insert a 15-well comb. Once the stacking gel has polymerized, transfer it to a running chamber and fill the upper and lower chambers with running buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 192 mM glycine [pH 8.3], and 0.1% SDS [w/v]).\nLoad 10 µL of sample per lane in a 15-lane minigel. Avoid loading the samples in the first and the last lane on the gel and load the nonreducing sample buffer in all empty lanes to prevent the smiling of bands. Run the gels at constant a 25 mA/gel until the dye front is at the bottom of the gel.",
    "Remove the gels from the glass plates, stain the gels with protein-staining solution (10% acetic acid and 30% methanol in H2O + 0.25% brilliant blue R250 [w/v]) for 5 min with agitation, and then, destain for 30 min with destaining solution (staining solution without brilliant blue R250).\nArrange the gels face-down on a plastic wrap and, then, place 0.4 mm chromatography paper on top of them. Place the gel sandwich chromatography paper-side down onto a gel dryer. Following the manufacturer's instructions, dry the gels for 2 h at 80 °C.\nTransfer the dried gels to a cassette and overlay them with autoradiography film or phosphor screen. If using autoradiography film, this step must be performed in a dark room.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
