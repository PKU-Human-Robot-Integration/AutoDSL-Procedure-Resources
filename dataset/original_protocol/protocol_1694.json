    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDirect imbibition of embryos\nTiming: 1–2 h\nIn this step, naked embryos are directly exposed to solutions of varying levels of water potential.\nPrepare solutions of varying levels of water potential.\nPrepare a stock solution containing a high concentration of an osmolyte of your choice that will be used to modify the water potential. For example, in Dorone et al., (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], we used NaCl, mannitol and sorbitol. In the case of NaCl, a solution of up to 6 M can be prepared by mixing 17.532 g NaCl (Sigma-Aldrich) in double-distilled water and adjusting the volume to 50 mL.\nNote: It is best to first prepare a high concentration of the osmolyte (without surpassing its maximum solubility) as well as a high volume to minimize variabilities between experiments. In the example above, we chose 6 M and 50 mL NaCl which will be used as a stock solution in the next step to generate 2 mL solutions of 0.2–1.8 M.\nPrepare dilutions of the stock solutions. In the case of NaCl, prepare solutions in increments of 200 mM from 0 M to 2 M. To mitigate pipetting inaccuracies, we recommend preparing first a 10 mL secondary stock of 2 M, and then preparing solutions of 2 mL using the following table:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1279_1.csv\nNote: We found in (Dorone et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) that exposure of embryos to 2 M NaCl induces a similar subcellular localization of FLOE1 as in the dry state, and therefore chose 2 M NaCl as the upper bound for the serial dilutions. However, depending on the protein of interest, the upper bound may be different and this parameter will need to be determined empirically.\nSeed treatment.\nSeed imbibition:",
    "Submerge 2–3 seeds in 0.5–1 mL in one of the osmolyte solutions prepared in step 1. Ensure that the seeds sink to the bottom of the 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube by inverting it a few times.\nIncubate for 15–30 min at room temperature (20°C–23°C).\nTo examine the dry state of the embryo, submerge 2–3 seeds in 0.5–1 mL glycerin. Glycerin is a non-aqueous solution that, upon seed coat removal, will maintain the hydration state of the embryo as it was in the intact seed (Dorone et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). It also serves as an immersion medium for the embryo during imaging.\nSeed dissection.\nPipette one seed with approximately 5–10 μL of the solution in which it was submerged. Place on a cover slip or slide.\nUnder a dissecting microscope (3× magnification), hold the seed between tweezer tips (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1279-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Dissection of an Arabidopsis thaliana seed\n(A) An Arabidopsis seed is held between tweezer tips while its seed coat and endosperm are being scraped off with a tungsten needle.\n(B–F) The same seed is imaged at different stages of dissection. A cavity is first created by superficially scraping the seed coat and endosperm off. Then, the embryo is gently pushed through it.\nScale bar for (B–F) is shown in F.\nUsing a tungsten needle held with a pin holder (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]), superficially scrape the seed coat and endosperm without damaging the embryo to create a large enough cavity for the embryo to pass through (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C).\nGently push the embryo out of the cavity to remove the seed coat and endosperm (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D–1F).",
    "Note: This step can be particularly challenging when dissecting seeds in non-aqueous solutions or under very low levels of water potential. In these cases, we recommend gently scraping the surface across the entire embryo until all the seed coat and endosperm pieces come off. Damaged embryos (see Figures 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8] and 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]) should be removed from further analysis.\nPipette the seed coat and endosperm debris out.\nAdd 20–50 μL of the osmolyte solution or glycerin depending on the condition.\nPlace a cover slip on top and proceed immediately to Imaging.\nNote: Rinse the tweezers and needle with water and wipe between each dissection to avoid the formation of osmolyte crystals upon evaporation.\nPhysiologically relevant imbibition of the embryos\nTiming: variable (> 1 day)\nIn this step, intact seeds are imbibed at physiologically relevant osmolyte concentrations. After this step, seeds are dissected in glycerin to preserve the hydration state of the embryos as it was prior to seed coat removal. As a result, the subcellular localization of the protein of interest can be assessed at the hydration state that is naturally achieved within intact seeds.\nFresh media preparation.\nPrepare standard growth medium:\nPrepare Murashige and Skoog (“MS”) medium using the following recipe:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1279_2.csv\nBefore adding the agar, adjust the pH to 5.7 using potassium hydroxide.\nAutoclave using a liquid cycle (20–30 min, 121°C).\nNote: Other growth media can be chosen depending on the study. For example, medium containing only water and agar, or MS medium without sucrose can be used.\nPrepare the osmolyte:\nWeigh the osmolyte of choice needed to generate a 5–10× stock medium. For NaCl, weigh 29.22 g (which will be used to make a 1M stock solution in step 4c).\nAutoclave a bottle containing the weighed osmolyte using a dry cycle (20–30 min, 121°C).",
    "Prepare a stock medium by filling the autoclaved bottle from step 4b. with the media prepared in step 4a. to the required volume. In the case of NaCl, add MS medium to the 29.22 g from step 4b for a final volume of 500 mL to obtain a 1M NaCl solution.\nNote: While the osmolyte can be introduced directly in step 4a., we recommend separating these two steps as evaporation during autoclaving will concentrate the osmolyte and affect reproducibility.\nUse the stock medium to prepare diluted media at the desired concentrations. In the case of NaCl, the following range of concentrations can be prepared:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1279_3.csv\nNote: We recommend using this approach of diluting a stock medium instead of preparing each medium individually from scratch. In our experience, even small variabilities during preparation affect the results, which makes the experiment less reproducible.\nNote: Here, 280 mM NaCl was chosen as the maximum concentration since Col-0 (WT) seeds will stop germinating at concentrations above 240 mM (Dorone et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]). However, for other ecotypes or genotypes, this upper bound may differ.\nPlate the media in a sterile, laminar flow hood:\nTo avoid evaporation after plating that may alter the final osmolyte concentration, cool the bottles to 50°C in a water bath set at 50°C.\nGently shake the bottle to mix its content, and pipette 40 mL into square petri dishes (120 × 120 wide × 15 mm high (VWR)).\nClose the plates as soon as they dry (∼10 min) to avoid evaporation.\nSeed sterilization. Work in a sterile, laminar flow hood\nPlace 20–100 seeds in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and add 1–1.5 mL of freshly prepared 70% ethanol (70:30 v/v ethanol:double-distilled water).\nVortex for 5 min.\nDiscard the solution and add 1 mL of 100% ethanol.",
    "Pipette the seeds onto pre-sterilized filter papers (e.g., Grade 410, VWR)\nLet the seeds dry on the filter papers for at least 20 min.\nSeed imbibition.\nPlace the seeds onto the agar plates prepared in step 4e by gently tapping them off the filter papers. Ensure that seeds are spaced out. Seeds that touch one another can be separated with a sterile toothpick.\nSeal the plates with micropore surgical tape (3M).\nPlace the plates at the desired conditions. For example, seeds can be first stratified by placing the plates in the dark at 4°C for 3–5 days, and then placed in a growth cabinet at 22°C–23°C with 16 h light/8 h dark with 130 μmol m−2 s−1 PPFD and 50%–60% relative humidity.\nCritical: The purpose of this protocol is to assess protein localization before Phase III of water uptake (i.e., during germination sensu stricto). It is important to ensure that seeds have not yet entered Phase III when imaging. For instance, under low osmolyte concentrations (e.g., < 80 mM NaCl), Col-0 seeds will typically start germinating within 24 hours when placed in otherwise optimal conditions (e.g., 22°C with illumination at 130 μmol m−2 s−1 PPFD). At that point, cells will have begun dramatic structural changes that will make comparisons with seeds placed under higher osmolyte concentrations less relevant. See Troubleshooting, problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5] for an example of such changes.\nTo capture the hydration state of the seeds at a given time point, pick 2–3 seeds from the plates using a sterile toothpick or equivalent, and submerge in 0.5–1 mL glycerin. If the experiment involves a time series, work in sterile conditions and place the plate back in its experimental conditions until the next time point.\nDissect seeds as described in step 3 and proceed immediately to Imaging[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec2.3].\nImaging\nTiming: 30–60 min",
    "In this step, we describe live embryo imaging using a Leica TCS SP8 laser scanning confocal microscope. While many of the steps described are specific to the Leica system, they can be easily adapted to use other confocal microscopes and software.\nSoftware set up.\nOpen the Leica Application Suite X software.\nSelect resonant mode when prompted.\n“Configuration” settings:\nIn the “Laser Config” tab, turn on the white light laser (WLL) and set at 70%.\nIn the “Hardware” tab, enable “Line Average during Live Acquisition” and set the “Bit Depth Resolution” at 12 bit.\nIn the “USB Panel” tab, select the “Fine” option for the “Phase” setting.\n“Acquire” settings:\nIn the “Acquisition” tab, enable “Bidirectional X”, set the “Line Average” at 32, and set the “Zoom Factor” at 1.25 (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, 2C, and 2D).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1279-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Initial imaging configurations on the Leica Application Suite X software\nNote: the line average can be set at lower or higher than 32 depending on the laser intensity, the fluorescence level of the protein of interest, and the desired resolution.\nSet the excitation wavelength at 488 nm if using GFP (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nSelect the HC PL APO CS2 63×/1.20 WATER objective if using samples mounted in aqueous solutions and 63/1.30 GLYCERIN if mounted in glycerin (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nTurn on one of the HyD SMD (Hybrid Detector Single Molecule Detection) detectors and set a detection interval of 50 nm starting at a wavelength at least 10 nm higher than the emission wavelength. In the case of GFP, set it at 500–550 nm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nSet the lifetime gate filter at 1.00–6.00 ns (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nNote: Since most fluorescent proteins have fluorescence lifetimes within the 2.3–3.5 ns range (Mamontova et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]), a lifetime gate filter of 1.50–6.00 ns can also be used.",
    "Under TLD (Transmitted Light Detection) Turn on PMT Trans (transmission photomultiplier tube) (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nImage acquisition\nLoad sample using the appropriate immersion media (water when using the HC PL APO CS2 63×/1.20 WATER objective and glycerin when using the 63/1.30 GLYCERIN objective).\nNote: We recommend starting with the wild-type ecotype (e.g., Col-0) and getting familiar with the protein storage vacuoles’ autofluorescence to avoid confusing these signals with those of the fluorescently tagged protein of interest. See Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1279-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Protein storage vacuoles are autofluorescent\nA section of an embryonic radicle of Col-0 (WT) was imaged with different settings. Protein storage vacuoles are autofluorescent at imaging settings typically used for GFP imaging (top panels), RFP imaging (bottom left panel) as well as at the lower end of the visible spectrum (bottom right panel). Fluorescence lifetime gating of 1–6 ns (top middle panel) and of 2–6 ns (top right panel) can reduce autofluorescence. Single optical section images are shown.\nFind and focus on the sample. For example, in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]K we centered on an embryonic radicle.\nAdjust the gain on the transmitted light channel (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nStarting with a low laser intensity (e.g., 1% of the laser intensity), adjust intensity until the HyD SMD channel detects the fluorescence signal without reaching saturation which could damage the detector. One way of assessing saturation is to view the acquisition by its intensity values by clicking on the “Over-/underexposure” button (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]J). The laser intensity can then be adjusted until only a minimal number of pixels appear blue.\nCritical: When gating is turned on, the detector is exposed to a higher intensity than it appears on the software. To avoid damaging the detector, gating can be turned off while setting up the laser intensity.",
    "Adjust the phase so that the image appears clear (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nSet the Z-Stack (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nIf needed, adjust the Line Average number (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D) so that the signal appears less grainy.\nStart image acquisition."
