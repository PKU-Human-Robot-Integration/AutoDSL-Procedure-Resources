    "sgRNA in silico design for the LRP10 locusDetermine the optimal CRISPR/Cas9 target sites using the CHOPCHOP web tool (http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no[href=http://chopchop.cbu.uib.no]) (Labun et al., 2019) or another preferable CRISPR/Cas9 design tool. Pick sgRNA (20 bp) with the highest predicted efficiency and the lowest predicted off-targets. The sequence of the optimal sgRNA is used to design sense and antisense oligonucleotides to clone the sgRNA into pSpCas9-(BB)-2A-GFP (see step 2). We recommend testing the targeting efficiency of several sgRNA designed against different exons of the gene of interest.To clone sgRNA into pSpCas9-(BB)-2A-GFP (Ran et al., 2013), order sense and antisense oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) with proper BbsI overhangs. These oligonucleotides need to be phosphorylated at the 5’ ends. Importantly, the pSpCas9-(BB)-2A-GFP allows the expression of the sgRNA under the control of the human U6 promoter, which requires a “G” base at the transcription start site. Therefore, add “G” at the start of the sgRNA sequence. For the LRP10 KO, we used sgRNA targeting the first exon of the LRP10 gene (ordered oligonucleotides: 5′-P-CACCGCGTTTCGGTTCTTACCAAGG and 5′-P-AAACCCTTGGTAAGAACCGAAACGC). The target genomic sequence for the generation of the LRP10 KO was chosen based on the score of the online CHOPCHOP tool and the prior testing of multiple sgRNA targeting different exons of the LRP10 gene.Oligo design template:sgRNA-oligo-FW: 5’-P-CACC(G)NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN-3’sgRNA-oligo-RV: 5’-P-AAACNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN(C)-3’P, phosphorylatedCloning of sgRNA into pSpCas9-(BB)-2A-GFP plasmidOligonucleotide annealing. Adjust the concentration of the oligonucleotides to 100 µM using sterile demineralized water (dH2O) or TE buffer and combine in the annealing reaction (Table 1). Incubate the reaction in the thermal cycler at 95 °C for 5 min. Next, ramp down to 25 °C at 5 °C/min. The annealed product can be stored at -20 °C for several months.Table 1.

    "Set up the restriction enzyme digestion for pSpCas9-(BB)-2A-GFP plasmid with BbsI enzyme (Table 2). Incubate for 90 min at 37 °C. Inactivate the restriction enzyme for 20 min at 65 °C. Load 3 µL of the digested vector on 0.8% agarose gel to check the restriction reaction efficiency. BbsI enzyme cuts the plasmid at two positions, removing 22 base pairs from the plasmid. The uncut plasmid DNA on the agarose gel has a multiple-band pattern (three bands running above 7 kbp) due to several plasmid conformations. The BbsI-digested plasmid DNA shows a single-band pattern running around 9 kbp.Note: Typically, high cutting efficiency of BbsI is achieved and, therefore, purification of the linearized vector from the gel is not required.

    "Next day, pick the colonies (at least six) and inoculate them in a 3 mL bacterial growth medium (LB) containing 50 µg/mL of ampicillin at 37 °C and 200 rpm overnight. Next, perform plasmid mini preparations using a NucleoBond PC mini kit following the manufacturer’s specifications or an in-house protocol. Verify correct clones by Sanger sequencing using a hU6-FW primer (5’- GAGGGCCTATTTCCCATGATT) with BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit or an in-house protocol. Select one correct clone to proceed to the next step.Note: Make sure that your plasmid DNA is transfection-grade. DNA preparations obtained from the NucleoBond PC mini kit are suited for molecular-grade experiments and can be directly used for cell transfections. Cell culture and transfectionMaintain HuTu-80 cells in growth medium (see Recipes) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Split the cells when 80% confluent. Maintain HEK 293T cells in growth medium (see Recipes) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Split the cells when 80% confluent.The day before transfection, seed the following quantities of cells in one well of a 6-well plate: 0.5 million HEK 293T cells and 0.3 million HuTu-80 cells. The next day, cells will reach 30%–40% confluence and are ready for transfection.Transfect the cells in one well of a 6-well plate. Perform the transfection with pSpCas9-(BB)-2A-GFP containing sgRNA using GeneJuice® transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s specifications.Forty-eight hours later, check the transfection efficiency using a benchtop imaging system equipped with the appropriate light cube to visualize GFP-positive cells. Transfected cells express GFP. Transfection efficiency in HuTu-80 cells is low to moderate (10%–30%). Transfection efficiency in HEK 293T cells is high (approximately 80%).Prepare the transfected cells for fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) 48 h post-transfection.",
    "96-well plate preparationOn the day of FACS, prepare three 96-well plates (flat bottom) by adding 150 µL of HuTu-80 or HEK 293T growth medium to each well.Incubate the plates before FACS at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for at least 30 min to equilibrate the medium.FACSFor single-cell sorting, aspirate the medium from the well of the 6-well plate and wash it once with DPBS-/-.Add 1 mL of trypsin–EDTA to the well and incubate it at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5 min.Add 1 mL of growth medium to the well, gently resuspend to dislodge the cells from the plate, and transfer the cells to a 15 mL Falcon tube.Spin the cells at 1,000 rpm (198 × g) for 5 min.Aspirate and discard the supernatant. Next, resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of DPBS-/- containing 4% FBS.Transfer 1 mL of the cell solution to a FalconTM round-bottom polystyrene test tube with a cell strainer snap cap.Add 1 µL of sterile Hoechst 33342 solution to label dead cells and mix gently by inverting the tube.Sort GFP-positive cells into three 96-well plates (1 cell per well) by gating out doublets (forward and sideward scatter-based) and dead cells (Hoechst 33342 positive cells). Select the population of cells with high GFP expression. Figure 1 represents the FACS settings on BD FACSAriaTM III for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated LRP10 KO in HuTu-80 cells. Optionally, include a negative control sample (non-transfected and non-Hoechst–stained cells) to optimally determine the gating of the positive cell population.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4521/bioprotoc-12-19-4521-g001.jpgFigure 1. Example of FACS sorting gating settings for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated KO in HuTu-80 cell line. Expansion of single cells post-sortingImmediately after sorting, incubate plates at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 72 h.Perform the first medium change with 150 µL of growth medium.",
    "Perform subsequent media changes every 72 h until colonies are observed under the light microscope.The colonies start to emerge 14 days after sorting. You can expect a minimum of 10 clones from one 96-well plate for the HuTu-80 cells. You can expect a minimum of 30 clones from one 96-well plate for the HEK 293T cells.When colonies reach 80% confluence, aspirate the media from the 96-well plates, wash with DPBS-/-, add 50 µL of trypsin–EDTA per well, and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5 min.Next, add 150 µL of growth media per well, resuspend to dislodge the cells, and transfer each clone to separate 15 mL Falcon tubes. Spin at 1,000 rpm (198 × g).Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet of each clone in fresh 150 µL of growth media. Add one-half (75 µL) of the cell suspension to a new well of a 48-well plate (PCR processing plate) and fill that well with an additional 225 µL of growth media. Add another half (75 µL) of the cell suspension to a new 48-well plate (propagation plate) and fill that well with an additional 225 µL of growth media.Processing of plates and verification of positive clonesPCR processing plate. Grow clones until they reach 80% confluence. When ready, extract genomic DNA with an in-house protocol or using a blood & cell culture DNA mini kit. Amplify the DNA fragment of interest by PCR using primers flanking LRP10 exon 1 (FW: CAAAGTTTGGCCCGAAGAGG, RV: GGGCAGGCAGGATAGAGTGC), and perform Sanger sequencing following your in-house protocols. Perform INDEL tracking manually or with a freely available web tool (TIDE, http://shinyapps.datacurators.nl/tide/[href=http://shinyapps.datacurators.nl/tide/]) to identify targeted clones (Brinkman et al., 2014).Propagation plate.",
    "Grow clones until they reach 80% confluence and then cryopreserve as follows: aspirate the media, wash with DPBS-/-, add 50 µL of trypsin–EDTA per well, and incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 5 min. To each well, add 300 µL of growth media containing 10% DMSO. Wrap the plates with ParafilmTM wrapper and store them in a zippered plastic bag in the freezer at -80 °C. The cells will stay frozen during the screening. As you identify positive clones, thaw and expand the desired clones according to your in-house protocol. Additionally, thaw and expand three unedited clones (LRP10 WT) that underwent the same genome-editing procedure. These clones can be used as a control condition for the downstream experiments. The amount of LRP10 at the transcript and protein level for each clone can be further characterized by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. Below, we briefly describe the recommendations and kits used for the RT-qPCR and Western blotting experiments.RT-qPCRRecommendations For RT-qPCR, we recommend the following primer sets for the LRP10:Set 1 (LRP10-N-terminal): FW: ACTGCACCTGGCTCATCC and RV: GAGATCAGTGGCTGGAGAGGSet 2 (LRP10-C-terminal): FW: CCAGGAGTACAGCATCTTTGC and RV: TAGCAGAGAACGCAGGTTGCRelative LRP10 mRNA levels can be determined after normalization to the geometric mean of the following housekeeping genes:CLK2 (FW: TCGTTAGCACCTTAGGAGAGG, RV: TGATCTTCAGGGCAACTCG)COPS5 (FW: CCAGGAACCATTTGTAGCAG, RV: GTAGCCCTTTGGGTATGTCC)RNF10 (FW:GCATCTGTGAACTGGCTTTG, RV: CTGACGTTTCCTCTTCTCAATG)Procedure Extract RNA from cells using RNeasy mini kit following the manufacturer’s specifications.For each sample (clonal line), perform first-strand cDNA synthesis with random hexamers using SuperScript® III first-strand synthesis system, followed by RNase H digestion. Follow the manufacturer’s specifications. Use 1 µg of RNA per cDNA reaction.Next, use iTaqTM Universal SYBR® green supermix to prepare RT-qPCR reactions. Follow the manufacturer’s specifications. For each cDNA sample, prepare five separate reactions (five different primer sets). Each reaction contains iTaqTM Universal SYBR® green supermix, a primer set, and 100 ng of cDNA.",
    "Each reaction should be performed in triplicate (technical replicates for the RT-qPCR).Load the PCR tubes or plate into the RT-PCR instrument and start the PCR run. Our thermal cycling protocol is optimized for CFX Opus 96 Real-Time PCR with the following conditions: 3 min at 95 °C (initial denaturation), 40 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C, and 30 s at 60 °C.The relative normalized LRP10 mRNA expression can be quantified using CFX Maestro Software for CFX Real-Time PCR Instruments.Western blottingRecommendations For Western blotting, we recommend using the LRP10-NT (1-440 aa) (Sino Biological, 13228-T16) and LRP10-CT (463-713 aa) (MRC PPU Reagents, DA058) antibodies at the concentration of 1:500 (Grochowska et al., 2021). We recommend the following fluorescently conjugated secondary antibodies: donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody, Alexa FluorTM Plus 800 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A32808), and Alexa Fluor® 680 AffiniPure donkey anti-sheep IgG (H+L) (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 713-625-147) at the concentration of 1:1,000.Procedure Before protein lysis, wash the cells once with 1× TBS (see Recipes). Subsequently, add the protein lysis buffer (see Recipes) that contains freshly added protease inhibitors, 1× cOmpleteTM, and 1 mM Pefabloc® SC.Snap-freeze the lysates. Next, thaw the lysates and clear them by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm (1,628 × g) and 4 °C for 10 min.Mix the lysates with 4× sample buffer supplemented with 100 mM DTT and incubate for 10 min at 95 °C.Separate the proteins on 4%–15% Criterion TGX precast gel.
