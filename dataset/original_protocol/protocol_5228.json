    "Bone marrow isolation and dendritic cell differentiation and cultureSacrifice mice using CO2 accordingly to the institutional IACUC recommendations.Spray the entire mouse fur with 70% ethanol to avoid contaminations. Using a scissor cut the fur at the hip area and pull the skin down off the leg toward the foot.Once the skin removed, cut into pelvis and remove tibia and femur using a scissor. Hold tibia and femur with forceps and clean bones by cutting off all muscle/fat tissue using a scissor.Note: Steps A2 to A4 can be performed on a clean bench. Place the cleaned bones under a laminar flow hood -to work aseptically- into a 10 cm Petri dish with ice cold sterile PBS.Fill 1 ml syringe with fresh sterile cold PBS and, by holding the bone with the forceps, insert the needle into one hand and flush the bone marrow out the other hand in a second Petri dish containing 2-3 ml sterile cold PBS. Make a single cell suspension by passing through up and down with the same syringe.Refill the syringe with the PBS from the second Petri dish and repeat steps A6 and A7 until the bone becomes clear.Collect the cells in a conical 50 ml tube by filtering through a 70 μm cell strainer to remove any contamination of bone debris and tissue. Wash the Petri dish by pipetting up and down 1-2 ml PBS to be sure to recover all bone marrow cells, and add to the 50 ml tube through the 70 μm cell strainer.Adjust the final volume of the conical 50 ml tube to 30-40 ml with ice cold PBS. Pellet cells for 5 min at 435 x g.",
    "Remove the supernatant and resuspend in 1 ml of red blood cell lysis buffer, incubate for 1 min at room temperature, then add 25 ml of PBS to wash the cells and centrifuge for 5 min at 435 x g. Resuspend the pellet in 5 ml of Bone Marrow Dendritic Cells (BMDC) medium (see Recipes) and filter in a new 50 ml conical tube using a clean 70 μm cell strainer to remove dead cells. Count the cells using a hemocytometer or an automatic cell counter. Typically from 1 adult mouse 10 week old the yield should be 40 x 106 cells. Adjust the volume to a density of 106 cells/ml using BMDC medium, and plate 1 ml per well in a 24 well tissue culture plate.Incubate for 5 days in a cell incubator (37 °C, 5% CO2), adding 1 ml of BMDC medium at day 3 of culture. This is day 0. BMDC are semi-adherent, round cells that should not show extending dendrites when immature. BMDC purity can be assessed by flow cytometry using anti-mouse CD11c and MHC-II markers.Before use, count cells from 1 well after removing BMDC by pipetting up and down the medium very gently and washing out the well with 1 ml ice cold PBS. This cell number should be constant throughout the 24 wells. Centrifuge for 5 min at 279 x g. Add directly to the BMDC culture the phagocytic cargo (see Procedure B) resuspended in 200 μl of PBS or medium and then centrifuge the 24 well plate at 279 x g for 2 min.Alternatively, to get rid of contaminant cells that are not differentiated BMDC and adhere to the plate, BMDC can be removed from the 24 well plate as described in step A12 and replated in a new plate.",
    "Incubate BMDC (replated or not) with the phagocytic cargos for 8 h.Leave some BMDC without phagocytic cargo to be pulsed with peptide controls (see step A17 below).Harvest BMDC, collect in a conical tube and wash with cold PBS.Centrifuge for 5 min at 279 x g.Resuspend in T cell medium (see Recipes) at the concentration of 106 cells/ml.Plate in a 96 well plate 100 μl of BMDC immediately before adding the T cells. Pulsed unstimulated BMDC with 1 μg/ml of OVA329-337 and, in separate wells, Eα52-68 peptides. BMDC can be left on ice until T cells are ready.Phagocytic cargo preparationListeria monocytogenes cultureThe night before the infection, prepare a bacteria pre-culture: aseptically pick a loopful of frozen bacteria from the stock using a needle or loop and inoculate into a 5 ml tube with 3 ml of BHI medium.Incubate for 16 h in a 37 °C incubator shaker at 250 rpm.The next day, dilute the overnight culture 1/20 in a sterile flask with 20 ml of fresh BHI medium. Cap and incubate in a 37 °C incubator shaker until the culture reaches the exponential phase (0.5 < OD600 < 1) (usually it takes 1 h). Determine the bacterial concentration (for Listeria monocytogenes, an OD600 = 1 corresponds to 5 x 108 bacteria/ml) and calculate the volume of culture needed to infect A20 cells and BMDC at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 100. Transfer the appropriate volume of bacterial culture in one or more 50 ml tubes, centrifuge for 10 min at 3,113 x g, wash twice with sterile PBS.Add to cells 200 μl of bacteria in PBS or BMDC medium per well of cell culture.",
    "Note: Before addition to BMDC, bacteria should be killed by incubation for 2 h at 37 °C in PBS containing 50 μl of ampicillin, while A20 cells are infected with live bacteria. Preparation of A20 cells as apoptotic cell cargoA20 cells are grown in small flasks in A20 cell medium (see Recipes) in a cell incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2.Three days before the assay, remove the A20 cells from the flask by pipetting up and down and transfer in a 50 ml conical tube.Count A20 cells, centrifuge at 279 x g for 5 min and resuspend them in fresh medium at 1 x 106 cells/ml.Plate 3 ml of cells per well in 6 well plates and place in the incubator.Induction of apoptosis in A20 cells:A20 cells will be rendered apoptotic by anti-CD95 (FasR) treatment, with or without previous bacteria infection, and then used as plain (= uninfected) or infected apoptotic cargos.Plain apoptotic cells:At day 5, remove and count A20 cells, centrifuge at 279 x g for 5 min, then resuspend and plate 3 ml in a 6 well plate at 1 x 106 cells/ml in fresh medium containing the anti-CD95 at the final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml.Incubate for 2 h in a cell incubator. The duration of anti-CD95 treatment can vary and should be precisely determined by each investigator. Apoptosis can be verified by flow cytometry after 7ADD and Annexin V staining (apoptotic cells should be Annexin V positive and 7ADD negative).Infected apoptotic cellsAt day 5, remove and count A20 cells, centrifuge at 279 x g for 5 min, then resuspend and plate 3 ml in a 6 well plate at 1 x 106 cells/ml in fresh medium. Add 200 μl of Listeria at a moi = 100. Incubate for 8 h in a cell incubator.",
    "After 8 h, add ampicillin at the final concentration of 50 μg/ml (to kill all the bacteria) and 0.5 μg/ml of anti-CD95 to the culture, cultivate for additional 2 h.Harvest and count apoptotic cells (they should not appear blue after trypan blue staining–more than 90% must be trypan blue negative–if they are, they cannot be used for the assay and the investigator should re-work the duration of the anti-CD95 treatment).Centrifuge at 279 x g for 5 min, and resuspend in 200 μl PBS or medium per well.Apoptotic cells are added immediately to the BMDC culture at a ratio of 1:2 (BMDC:apoptotic cells) for 8 h.CD4 T cell isolation and CFSE labelingHarvest spleens and prepare a cell suspension in a 10 cm Petri dish containing 5 ml cold PBS by pressing the tissue through a 70 μm cell strainer followed by homogenization using a 20 G needle and a 3 ml syringe. Make a single cell suspension by passing through up and down with the same syringe. Typically, one mouse spleen contains 1 x 108 splenocytes.Transfer the cell suspension in a 15 ml conical tube and centrifuge for 5 min at 435 x g. Optional: Remove the supernatant and resuspend in 1 ml of red blood lysis buffer, incubate for 1 min at room temperature, then add 13 ml of PBS to wash the cell and centrifuge for 5 min at 435 x g. This step can be skipped since red blood cells are eliminated during the step of CD4+ T cell positive selection.Incubate splenocytes in 1x PBS containing 1 μg/ml anti-Fc receptor, 2% FBS, 2 mM EDTA, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and the anti-CD4 magnetic microbeads for CD4 T cell positive selection (Miltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "Proceed to CD4+ T cell positive selection by magnetic columns (Miltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer's instructions.Count and resuspend purified CD4 T cells in PBS at the concentration of 2 x 106 cells/ml.Add CFSE (final concentration 2.5 μM) very slowly to the cells while vortexing the tubes gently. Incubate for 10 min at 37 °C in the dark. Note: Leave some CD4 T cells unstained to perform flow cytometry compensations. Wash twice with PBS by completely filling the tube and centrifuging for 5 min at 435 x g. Successful CFSE staining of the cells should give a yellow/green pellet.Resuspend cells in T cell medium at the concentration of 2 x 106 cells/ml.Add 100 μl of CD4 T cells to the 96 well plates where BMDC were previously plated. Note: OT-II and 1H3.1 TCR transgenic CD4 T cells should be plated in separate wells to avoid antigen competition.Co-culture CD4 T cells and BMDC for 5 days.Assessing antigen presentationAt day 5, wash twice the plate containing the co-culture of CD4 T cells and BMDC with 200 μl of FACS buffer (see Recipes) by centrifuging for 2 min at 778 x g. Discard the supernatant.Add 100 μl of anti-mouse CD4 (1/100) in FACS buffer and incubate for 20 min on ice in the dark.Wash twice with 200 μl of FACS buffer.Resuspend in 200 μl of FACS buffer and analyze by flow cytometry."
