    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nImmortalized astrocyte culture and condition media collection\nTiming: ∼ 1.5 weeks\nImmortalized astrocytes are thawed and grown to confluency in 182 cm2 culture flasks. Condition media is added, and after 72 h the native apoE particle-containing media is collected for subsequent IP.\nNote: This protocol details the pull-down of native apoE lipoprotein particles from APOE3/3 immortalized astrocyte conditioned media as the apoE particle source and will describe the workflow to characterization via SEC with supporting data. However, this protocol has been successfully applied to multiple model sources, including iPSC-derived astrocytes and iPSC-derived organoids, and human biospecimens, including postmortem buffer-soluble human brain lysate, human plasma, and human cerebrospinal fluid. Details regarding the application of this protocol to the above listed apoE lipoprotein particle sources can be addressed through contacting the corresponding author. Therefore, this pull-down to characterization workflow can be adapted to the apoE source of interest and the desired characterization assay. Throughout the protocol, stopping points for specific downstream characterization techniques such as western blot, native PAGE, lipidomics, and SEC will be highlighted.\nNote: It is recommended that a minimum of three biological replicates, specifically independent cultures with subsequent independent pull-down experiments, are performed to account for variation in apoE quantity, pull-down efficiency, and elution efficiency.\nNote: During growth and conditioning of the immortalized astrocytes, we recommend preparing the stock of HJ15.4 antibody and mouse IgG isotype control conjugated beads for use during the subsequent IP.\nDay 1. Thaw 2.0 × 106 cells stored in 10% DMSO-FBS solution at 37°C using a water or bead bath.\nCollect the cells and wash them in immortalized astrocyte growth media.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 300 g for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 10 mL of fresh immortalized astrocyte growth media.",
    "Add them to a 75 cm2 growth area flask for incubation.\nNote: The immortalized astrocytes tend to clump together. Thus, to ensure an equal dispersion of cells be sure to resuspend the cells with moderate rigor and check for clumping using a light microscope before incubating the cells.\nNote: 2.0 × 106 cells will typically reach confluency in a 75 cm2 flask within 3 days of plating. If the cells have not reached confluency in this timeframe, continue to change the growth media every 3 days until confluency is reached.\nDay 4. Once confluency is reached, aspirate the growth media, and add 5 mL of TrypLE Express Enzyme to dissociate the cells from the flask.\nAdd 8 mL of growth media to the flask resuspending any remaining cells.\nCollect and centrifuge the mixture at 300 g for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 20 mL of growth media.\nAdd resuspended cells to a 182 cm2 growth area flask for incubation.\nNote: The time to reach confluency will depend on the passage dilution. A 1:3 passage dilution will typically take three days to reach confluency in a 182 cm2 growth area flask, but variation in the timeline has been observed.\nDay 7. Once optimal confluency is reached, aspirate the growth media, and add 20 mL of immortalized astrocyte condition media (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2735-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Representative images of APOE3/3 immortalized astrocyte growth stages prior, during, and after optimal confluency for conditioning\nAPOE3/3 immortalized astrocytes were seeded at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells in 9.6 cm2 growth area plates and cultured according to the above-described conditions (A-C).",
    "The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) prior to optimal conditioning cell confluency (A), during optimal conditioning confluency (B), and after optimal conditioning confluency (C). Brightfield and DAPI images were taken at 20× magnification. Scale bar = 100 μm.\nIncubate for 72 h before collecting apoE lipoprotein particle containing conditioned media.\nDay 10. Collect the 20 mL of conditioned media.\nCentrifuge at 1,000 g for 5 min to remove cell debris.\nTransfer the supernatant to a separate 50 mL conical tube careful to not disrupt the pellet.\nImmediately add 1× PhosSTOP Phosphatase Inhibitor and 1× cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Cocktail.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2735-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. ApoE size distribution of fresh and frozen APOE3/3 immortalized astrocyte conditioned media (iAS CM)\nThree independent APOE3/3 immortalized astrocyte batches were grown to confluency in 182.0 cm2 growth flasks and conditioned in 20 mL of 2%-FBS containing media for 72 h prior to collection. The media was split into two 10 mL aliquots, one of which was immediately frozen at −80°C, and the other was utilized for SEC. After 48 h, the frozen sample was thawed at 4°C and utilized for SEC. WUE-4 ELISA was performed using fractions 18–56 for both samples, and the size was calculated using commercial protein standard (A). The fractions were then divided into tertiles defined by size (≥615 kDa–20 kDa≥). The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated and paired t-tests (two-tailed) were performed utilizing GraphPad Prism 9.4.1. Data are represented as mean ± SEM. P < 0.05 is considered statistically significant. N.S. = Not significant (B).\nPause point: Store the condition media at 4°C for use within 1 week of collection or in −80°C for use within 1 month of collection.",
    "Note: The storage conditions described above are based on the data we collected within the timelines of our optimization experiments. There was no significant difference in apoE quantity (Fresh = 2.9 ± 0.453 μg/mL; Frozen = 2.4 ± 0.504 μg/mL; p = 0.28) or apoE lipoprotein particle size distribution following one −80°C freeze-thaw event (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The effect of multiple freeze-thaw events on native apoE lipoprotein particles was not thoroughly examined; thus, we recommend performing the IP using fresh media or following one freeze-thaw cycle.\nHJ15.4 and mouse IgG isotype control antibody bead coupling- day 1\nTiming: 5–6 h\nHJ15.4 anti-apoE antibody and mouse IgG isotype control antibody are coupled to CNBr-Activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads for pull-down of native apoE lipoprotein particles.\nAlternatives: HJ15.4 is a mouse monoclonal anti-apoE antibody, which has been validated to effectively pull-down native apoE lipoprotein particles per the described protocol. However, there are other alternative mouse monoclonal anti-apoE antibodies commercially available including WU-E4; however, we have not validated that these alternative antibodies pull-down native lipidated apoE lipoprotein particles.\nWeigh a pre-determined amount of CNBr-Activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads for desired bead stock volume.\nAdd to a 50 mL conical tube.\nNote: 1 g of beads will swell to approximately 3 mL of beads. The volumes described below will assume 1 g of beads are used, but these volumes can be adjusted proportionally for the desired scale.\nAdd 20 mL of 1 mM HCl to 1 g of beads creating a homogeneous mixture.\nIncubate the beads with mild agitation using program F8 (13 rpm) of the ELMI RM-2L Intelli-mixer for 45 min at 20°C–22°C.\nCentrifuge the mixture at 300 g for 1 min.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nWash the beads by adding 20 mL of Coupling buffer.",
    "Centrifuge at 300 g for 1 min and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the beads in Coupling buffer with enough volume to create a 1:1 slurry (i.e., 3 mL of beads + 3 mL of Coupling buffer produces 6 mL slurry).\nTransfer the slurry to a 15 mL conical tube for antibody coupling.\nDilute the stock antibody solution to 1 mg/mL using coupling buffer as the diluent with equal volume to the bead volume (i.e., 3 mL of 1 mg/mL antibody per 3 mL of beads).\nCritical: To ensure that effective antibody bead coupling has occurred, a Bradford Protein Assay will be performed comparing the diluted antibody input to the remaining antibody in the supernatant following the coupling reaction. Be sure to save at least 5 μL of the diluted antibody input for this purpose.\nAspirate the supernatant and add the diluted antibody solution to the swelled beads.\nAllow the coupling reaction to occur at 20°C–22°C with end-over-end mixing (program F1, 13 rpm) for 2.5 h.\nBriefly centrifuge the mixture at 300 g for 1 min.\nRemove 5 μL of the supernatant and perform a Bradford Coomassie protein assay to determine coupling efficacy (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2735-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Representative Bradford Coomassie protein assay results for verification of HJ15.4 antibody coupling to CNBr-Activated Sepharose 4 Fast Flow beads",
    "Three independent antibody coupling reactions were performed for 2.5 h at 20°C–22°C as described in the protocol above. A bovine serum albumin (BSA) standard curve was generated via serial dilution (2000 ng/mL- 0 ng/mL) and 5 μL of the pre-coupling diluted HJ15.4 antibody and the post-coupling supernatant was added to the indicated wells in duplicate, respectively (A). All samples were incubated with 150 μL of Coomassie reagent for 10 min at 20°C–22°C prior to measuring absorbance at 595 nm on a plate reader. Lastly, the mean protein concentration (ng/mL) remaining in the supernatant was divided by the mean protein concentration in the pre-coupling input to determine the percentage of antibody coupled to the beads. Data are represented as mean ± SEM (B). D1-2, Duplicate 1 and Duplicate 2; S1-3, Sample 1–3.\nNote: If a significant amount of protein remains in the supernatant following the initial coupling reaction, continue the reaction for at least another 30 min before repeating measurements.\nAspirate the remaining supernatant carefully to minimize bead loss.\nWash the beads by adding 2 bead volumes of coupling buffer.\nCentrifuge at 300 g for 1 min.\nAspirate the supernatant.\nQuench the unreacted groups on the beads by resuspending with 1 bead volume of 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0.\nPerform end-over-end mixing (program F1, 13 rpm) for 2 h at 20°C–22°C.\nAlternatives: Quenching of unreacted groups can also be accomplished utilizing 1 M ethanolamine pH 8.0.\nWash the beads by alternating between 1 bead volume of 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0 with 0.5 M NaCl and 1 bead volume of 0.1 M Acetate pH 4.0 with 0.5 M NaCl for three consecutive rounds.\nBetween each resuspension, centrifuge at 300 g for 30 s to pellet the beads and aspirate the supernatant.",
    "Following the third round of washing, aspirate the supernatant and wash the antibody conjugated beads with 1× PBS for use in IP.\nPause point: The antibody conjugated beads can be used immediately for IP or can be stored in at least two bead volumes of 0.02% NaN3-PBS at 4°C for prolonged periods of time.\nSample concentration and incubation- day 1\nTiming: 2 h (with ∼ 16h incubation period)\nAPOE3/3 immortalized astrocyte conditioned media is concentrated to the desired apoE concentration. The sample is then added to HJ15.4 and mouse IgG isotype control conjugated beads for native apoE lipoprotein particle pull-down.\nNote: The below steps will assume the conditioned media has been frozen at −80°C following step 4, and a large stock of antibody conjugated beads was stored in 0.02% NaN3-PBS at 4°C following step 16.\nThaw the immortalized astrocyte conditioned media at 4°C or on ice.\nNote: Conditioned media takes multiple hours to thaw at 4°C. We recommend that the media is thawed early in the day to allow ample time. We also recommend preparing the beads for sample incubation during this waiting period (step 20).\nCentrifuge the conditioned media at 1,000 g for 5 min.\nTransfer the supernatant to a separate 50 mL conical tube careful to not disrupt the pellet.\nConcentrate the conditioned media to the desired apoE concentration by adding 15 mL of conditioned media to one Amicon® Ultra-15 Centrifugal Filter Unit.\nCentrifuge at 4,500 g for 20 min at 4°C.\nRemove 5 mL of the flow-through and add the remaining 5 mL of conditioned media.\nCentrifuge at 4,500 g for 15 min at 4°C, or until the conditioned media has reached the desired volume (i.e., for a 20× concentration continue centrifugation until 1 mL of concentrated media remains).",
    "Collect the media from the centrifugal filter unit and store it in LoBind microcentrifuge tubes on ice.\nNote: The input apoE concentration should be determined based on the desired experimental outcome. For example, if the goal is to profile the size of apoE lipoprotein particles via SEC, a maximal possible input concentration is advised to maximize purified apoE quantity.\nNote: Based on our experience with our APOE3/3 immortalized astrocytes, we have observed that 1× conditioned media contains approximately 2.5 μg/mL of apoE per WUE-4 ELISA.\nAcquire the previously prepared HJ15.4 and IgG conjugated beads for washing.\nCentrifuge at 300 g for 1 min to pellet the beads.\nRemove 0.02% NaN3-PBS to 1 bead volume. Resuspend the beads to create a 1:1 bead slurry.\nTransfer the desired amount of bead slurry to LoBind microcentrifuge tubes.\nNote: We recommend that the sample volume is at least 10× the bead volume for equal distribution of beads throughout the media (i.e., 500 μL of sample for 50 μL of beads).\nWash the beads with 1× PBS in excess to remove the residual 0.02% NaN3.\nCentrifuge at 300 g for 1 min to pellet the beads and aspirate the wash buffer.\nCritical: Be careful to minimize bead loss in this step. The HJ15.4 and IgG isotype control beads should be equal in volume to have a proper negative control.\nAdd the immortalized astrocyte conditioned media to the antibody conjugated beads.\nIncubate the samples approximately 16 h at 4°C with end-over-end mixing and mild agitation (program F4, 13 rpm).\nBead wash and native ApoE lipoprotein particle elution- day 2\nTiming: 2 h\nThe native apoE-bound beads are washed to remove nonspecific proteins, and the particles are eluted for downstream characterization.",
    "Note: Stopping points for lipidomics will be pointed out, and workflows towards western blot and native PAGE will also be noted in addition to the primary description of SEC.\nCritical: Minimization of bead loss during the following steps is critical to maximize the quantity of purified apoE lipoprotein particles collected. Therefore, when collecting the supernatant, washing buffer, and eluent use syringes and 26 G × 5/8 subcutaneous needles with the bevel of the needle facing the wall of the LoBind microcentrifuge tube. We recommend placing the bevel of the needle where the beads and supernatant intersect to prevent puncturing the bottom of the tube (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nCentrifuge the apoE-bound beads at 300 g and 4°C for 1 min to pellet the beads.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2735-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4.

HJ15.4 relative apoE pull-down and elution efficiency\nAPOE3/3 immortalized astrocytes were grown to confluency in two 182.0 cm2 growth flask and conditioned in 20 mL of 2%-FBS containing media for 72 h prior to collection. The conditioned media was concentrated 20× and 1 mL of media (Input) was added to 50 μL of HJ15.4 monoclonal mouse anti-apoE antibody (HJ15.4) or the mouse IgG isotype control (mIgG) conjugated beads for IP, as described above. The beads were split into 25 μL aliquots following washing (step 25) and were eluted with 4 bead volumes of 3 M NaSCN (NaSCN EL) or 0.1 M glycine pH 2.5 (Gly EL). The eluent was collected, and the beads were resuspended in 1× SDS-containing sample buffer to elute any remaining apoE lipoprotein particles (NaSCN B and Gly B). A western blot was performed utilizing 1% of each respective sample, and K74180B (1:2000) was used for primary antibody detection (A). The membrane was imaged, and signal strength was quantified using Odyssey® CLx Infrared Imaging System by LI-COR Biosciences (B). Pull-down efficiency is estimated by calculating the percentage of apoE remaining in the supernatant sample (SN) post-16-h incubation compared to the input sample. Elution efficiency has been defined as the difference in apoE quantity pulled down and quantity of apoE eluted.\nPause point: Store the native apoE lipoprotein particles at 4°C while preparing for SEC.\nNote: To measure the elution efficiency via western blot, the beads can be resuspended in 1× SDS containing sample buffer and heated at 95°C for 10 min to elute any remaining apoE (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]). The elution reagent can be used directly for western blot and native PAGE. The apoE band may appear at a slightly higher molecular weight when imaging due to the high salt content in the elution reagent.",
    "Note: 3 M NaSCN is used as the elution reagent in this protocol, instead of the commonly used 0.1 M glycine, because of concerns regarding apoE lipoprotein particle integrity utilizing pH-dependent elution. Previous studies have successfully utilized 3 M NaSCN for apoE lipoprotein particle elution while maintaining particle integrity.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5],6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nSize exclusion chromatography of purified ApoE lipoprotein particles- day 2\nTiming: 4.5 h\nThe purified native apoE lipoprotein particles are diluted with SEC running buffer and manually injected into the ÄKTA pure 25 L1 FPLC system. The sample is run through tandem Superose® 6 Increase 10/300 GL columns fractionating the apoE lipoprotein particles and apoE-associated proteins by size for particle characterization.\nAlternatives: There are multiple FPLC and HPLC systems commercially available such as BioRad NGC Quest Chromatography System and Agilent 1260 Infinity II Bio-SEC Multi-Detector System. These analogous systems and their associated columns utilize the same fundamental principles of SEC, thus should generate comparable data. If using an alternative FPLC or HPLC system, we recommend utilizing the below protocol as guidelines that can be adapted according to the specifics of the alternative system.\nNote: Before beginning the below SEC protocol, make sure the ÄKTA pure 25 L1 FPLC system has been cleaned and prepared properly according to the ÄKTA pure user manual to avoid contamination from previous runs.\nNote: Our system has been configured such that the SEC running buffer is attached to inlet A1. Additionally, for our protocol optimization experiments, we typically use a 0.5 mL capillary loop for manual injection. However, this can be scaled up as needed.",
    "Critical: The columns used for SEC are two Superose® 6 Increase 10/300 GL columns connected in tandem. The column volume is 23.562 mL with a pre-column pressure limit of 5.0 MPa and a ΔC pressure limit of 2.60 MPa. The flow rate for all steps is 0.3 mL/min. These columns are easily damaged by gases, so take precautions to not introduce gases into the FPLC system.\nDilute the apoE lipoprotein particle containing eluent with additional 3 M NaSCN to bring the total volume to the loop injection volume.\nAdd an excess of SEC running buffer to prevent gases from being introduced into the system during the protocol execution.\nNote: For example, using a 0.5 mL capillary loop and 100 μL eluent, add 400 μL of additional 3 M NaSCN elution reagent and at least 150 μL of SEC running buffer to bring the total sample volume to 650 μL.\nUsing a syringe and blunt tip needle carefully draw up the sample.\nInvert the syringe, such that the needle is above the syringe, and remove the blunt tip needle.\nGently tap the syringe to remove gases from the sample prior to manual injection.\nCritical: Be sure all gas bubbles have been removed from the sample prior to injection into the FPLC system.\nInject the sample into the capillary loop via the injection port.\nLeave the syringe attached to the injection port throughout the protocol execution to prevent gases from being introduced into the system.\nNote: The below steps detail the SEC protocol parameters that will be inputted into the UNICORN™ 7 WrkStn pure-BP-exp software to execute SEC.

Following elution, SEC of both the pre-IP and the post-IP samples was performed, and WUE-4 ELISA was used to quantify apoE concentrations of the selected fractions (A). The fraction size was calculated using a commercially available protein standard and the fractions were then divided into tertiles defined by size (≥615 kDa–20 kDa≥).
