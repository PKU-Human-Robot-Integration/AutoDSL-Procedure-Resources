    "All animal procedures performed in this work are conducted according to the guidelines of the Laboratory Animal Facility of the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) and have been approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of HKUST. Safety training for laser handling is required to set up and operate the TPEF-SRS microscope. Always wear laser safety goggles with appropriate wavelength range when dealing with laser.\n1. Setup of the TPEF-SRS microscope (for setup schematic see Figure 1)\nUse an integrated optical parametric oscillator (OPO) connected with a mode-locked Ytterbium fiber laser as the ps laser source for SRS imaging.\n\tNOTE: OPO outputs a Stokes beam (1031 nm) and a pump beam (tunable from 780 nm to 960 nm) with 2 ps pulse duration and 80 MHz repetition rate. The Stokes beam is modulated at 20 MHz by a built-in electro-optical modulator (EOM) for high-frequency phase-sensitive SRS detection at MHz level.\nUse an fs titanium (Ti): sapphire laser as the laser source for TPEF imaging.\nUse a pair of lenses (L1 and L2) to collimate and adjust the size of the fs beam to 3 mm.\nUse a pair of lenses (L3 and L4) to collimate the ps laser beam and expand its diameter to 3 mm.\nChange the polarization of the fs laser beam from p polarization to s polarization using a half-wave plate.\nCombine the two laser beams with a polarizing beam splitter (PBS).\nAdd a pair of 3 mm XY-scan galvanometer mirrors behind the PBS for beam scanning.\nUse a telecentric scan lens (L5) and an infinity-corrected tube lens (L6) to conjugate the scanning mirror and the rear pupil of the 25x objective lens. Expand the laser beam by the scan lens and tube lens to fill the back aperture of the objective.",
    "Place a PBS or dichroic mirror (D2) between the tube lens and objective lens for SRS or fluorescence signal collection. Use a motorized flipper to switch between PBS and D2.\n\t​NOTE: Part of the back-scattered SRS signal is lost when passing through the PBS as a result of its randomly shifted polarization.\nUse a pair of lenses (L7 and L9) to narrow the detection beam and conjugate the rear pupil of the 25x objective lens with a photodiode sensor.\nUse a pair of lenses (L8 and L10) to narrow the detection beam and conjugate the rear pupil of the 25x objective with the detection surface of the photomultiplier (PMT).\nUse a dichroic mirror (D3) to separate the detection path of fluorescence and SRS signals.\nPlace a filter set (Fs1) in front of the photodiode detector to block the Stokes laser and pass the pump beam only.\nPlace a filter set (Fs2) in front of the PMT detector to pass the target fluorescence signal only.\nConnect the PMT to a current amplifier for signal amplification.\nConnect the photodiode to a lock-in amplifier.\nConnect the sync signal from the built-in EOM output to the reference input of the lock-in amplifier for SRS signal demodulation.\nConnect the PMT amplifier and lock-in amplifier outputs to the data acquisition module.\n2. TPEF-SRS microscope system calibration\nStartup of the lasers\n\t\nSwitch the key switch from Standby to On position to turn on the Ti: sapphire laser and wait for 30 min for the laser to warm up.\nSwitch on the OPO by clicking on the Start button on the OPO control panel and wait for 20 min for the laser to warm up.",
    "After the ps laser warms up, use a high-speed photodetector to check the modulation depth of the Stokes beam. Open the laser shutter for the Stokes beam. Click on the Set OPO Power box and enter 20. Place the high-speed photodetector at the OPO output to detect the beam. Connect the output port of the photodetector to the input port of an oscilloscope using a coaxial cable with Bayonet Neill-Concelman (BNC) connector to monitor the laser pulse.\nOpen the EOM Control window in the OPO control software. Adjust the EOM power and phase according to the pulse intensity diagram shown on the oscilloscope to achieve maximal modulation depth at 20 MHz.\n\t\tNOTE: EOM performance is usually stable and only needs to be checked when the SRS signal is found significantly decreased.\nOptical alignment of the combined TPEF-SRS microscope\n\t\nPerform optical alignment for colocalization of the ps and fs beams as described in steps 2.2.2 to 2.2.13.\nOpen the pump laser shutter while stopping the Stokes output in the OPO control software. Use OPO control software to set the wavelength of the pump beam to 796 nm by clicking the Set Signal box and entering the wavelength value 796. Click on the Set OPO Power box and enter 20 to set its power to the minimum (~20 mW) for optical alignment.\nSwitch on the microscope computer and all associated electronic components, including scanners, objective actuators, photodiodes, PMTs, current amplifiers, lock-in amplifiers, and motorized flippers. Start the microscope control software.\n\t\tNOTE: The microscope control software is a homemade interface.\nPlace two alignment plates (P1 and P2 in Figure 1) on the optical path. Place P1 behind PBS at a distance of about 10 cm and place P2 behind P1 at a distance of about 30 cm.",
    "NOTE: The ps and fs beams are combined using a PBS (Figure 1). The two alignment plates are used to check the alignment as well as the colocalization of the two laser beams.\nOpen the microscope shutter for the ps laser beam.\nAdjust the mirror M1 to locate the ps laser beam center at the through-hole of P1. Use an infrared (IR) scope to observe the position of the beam spot at P1 when adjusting the mirror M1.\nAdjust the mirror M2 to locate the ps laser beam center at the through-hole of P2. Use the IR scope to observe the position of the beam spot at P2 when adjusting the mirror M2.\nRepeat steps 2.2.6 and 2.2.7 until the ps beam center locates at the through-hole of both alignment plates. Close the shutter of the ps beam in the microscope control software.\nSet the wavelength of fs Ti: sapphire laser at 740 nm and open the laser shutter. Set the laser power to 5 mW (measured at the input port of the microscope system) for optical alignment.\nOpen the microscope shutter for the fs laser beam.\nAdjust the mirror M3 to locate the fs laser beam spot center at the through-hole of P1.\nAdjust the mirror M4 to locate the laser beam spot center at the through-hole of P2.\nRepeat steps 2.2.11 and 2.2.12 until the fs laser beam center locates at the through-holes of two alignment plates. Close the microscope shutter for the fs beam.\nPerform spatial overlapping of the pump and Stokes beams as described in steps 2.2.15 to 2.2.18.",
    "​NOTE: Although the pump and Stokes beams are roughly overlapped inside the ps laser, fine-tuning of the positions of the two laser beams is required to achieve optimal SRS performance. Since the pump beam is firstly aligned as previously described, next the Stokes beam is adjusted to colocalize with the pump beam.\nPlace a camera at the position of the objective to visualize the location of two beam spots. Mark the position of the pump beam on the camera screen as a reference.\nPlace an alignment plate P0 before L3 (Figure 1). Use a hex key to adjust the optical mirror 1 (OM1) so that the Stokes beam center passes the through-hole of the alignment plate and colocalizes with the pump beam at the laser output port. Use the IR scope to confirm the position of the beam spot at P0 during adjustment.\n\t\tNOTE: OM1 and OM2 are two mirrors in the OPO head to adjust the position of the 1031 nm Stokes beam.\nRemove the alignment plate P0 and use the hex key to adjust the OM2 so that the center of the Stokes beam colocalizes with the reference mark of the pump beam on the camera.\nRepeat steps 2.2.16 and 2.2.17 until the Stokes beam strictly overlaps with the pump beam at both P0 and camera planes.\n\t\tNOTE: When visualizing the beam spots on the camera, all the alignment plates should be removed from the optical path.\nOptimize imaging conditions\n\t\nPerform phase adjustment of the lock-in amplifier as described in steps 2.3.2. to 2.3.7.",
    "NOTE: SRS detection is based on a high-frequency phase-sensitive scheme. For SRL detection, the intensity of the Stokes beam is modulated at 20 MHz and a lock-in amplifier is used to demodulate the signal. The phase and offset of the lock-in amplifier need to be adjusted to achieve the optimal image contrast.\nOpen the lock-in amplifier control software.\nSet the wavelength of the pump laser to 796 nm and the power of the pump and Stokes beam to be 15 mW and 25 mW on the sample, respectively.\n\t\tNOTE: Here use olive oil for SRS imaging optimization and calibration. The Raman peak of olive oil at the carbon-hydrogen region is at 2863.5 cm-1, corresponding to the pump beam wavelength at 796 nm.\nSeal the olive oil in a slide and attach a folded tissue paper to the bottom of the slide to enhance the signal backscattering for epi-SRS detection. Place the olive oil sample on the stage and adjust the focus of the 25x objective onto the sample.\nUse the microscope control software to set the imaging parameters as follows: 512 x 512 pixels for 500 μm x 500 μm field of view (FOV), 6.4 μs pixel dwell time. Use the lock-in amplifier control software to set the time constant value to be 10 μs, which is close to the pixel dwell time.\nScan the laser beam over the sample. Use the lock-in amplifier control software to tune the phase (0-180°) with a step size of 22.5° until the SRS signal intensity reaches the maximum.",
    "NOTE: In this all-analog lock-in amplifier, the signal output is the in-phase component, which is dependent on the phase of the reference signal. The phase can be adjusted by the lock-in amplifier control software with 11° resolution, allowing to maximize the detected signal to within ~2%12. The lock-in amplifier gets out of phase once the sync signal is disrupted. The phase needs to be readjusted every time the sync signal is reestablished.\nScan the sample with laser shutter closed. Use the lock-in amplifier control software to tune the offset value with a step size of 1 mV until the average SRS signal is close to zero.\n\t\tNOTE: The average SRS signal is estimated as the average intensity of all pixels in the SRS image, which is calculated automatically by the microscope control software. Offsets are useful for canceling unwanted phase-coherent signals.\nPerform temporal synchronization optimization as described in steps 2.3.9 to 2.3.14.\nOpen the Delay Manager dialogue (Figure 2) in the OPO control software.\nScan the olive oil and tune the delay stage until the olive oil SRS signal reaches its maximum.\n\t\tNOTE: For the first time of SRS imaging, when the phase of the lock-in amplifier has not been optimized, temporal synchronization is first roughly adjusted to visualize the SRS signal of the sample before optimizing the phase of the lock-in amplifier.\nStop scanning and click on the Add Data button in the delay manager dialogue to record the current delay data.\nRepeat steps 2.3. 10 and 2.3.11 for different chemical samples at different wavelengths.\n\t\tNOTE: Polystyrene beads, heavy water, 5-Ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine, glycerol are used to measure the delay data at different vibrational bands.",
    "Select the Data Fit and Order 5 on the delay manager dialogue to fit the current data points with the fifth-order polynomic function. Apply the fitted data by clicking on the Use As Custom button and checking the check box. The delay stage will be auto-adjusted at different wavelengths according to the fitted delay curve.\nSave all the delay data in a text file, which can be loaded for future use.\n3. Surgical preparation of mouse for in vivo fluorescence and SRS imaging\nSterilize all required tools, including scalpels, spring scissors, forceps, coverslips, and gauze pads.\nDisinfect all the surfaces, which would be touched during surgery with 70% ethanol. Cover the working area of the benchtop with sterile drapes. Put a heating pad under the drape.\nUse Thy1-YFP-H (Tg(Thy1-YFP)HJrs/J)37 transgenic mice that express enhanced yellow fluorescence protein (EYFP) in dorsal root ganglion afferent neurons for in vivo spinal cord imaging. Weigh the mouse and induce anesthetization by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of the ketamine-xylazine mixture (87.5 mg kg-1 and 12.5 mg kg-1).\nPinch the toe of the mouse to ensure deep anesthesia. Supplement with half the original dose of the anesthetics if needed. Apply ointment to the mouse eyes to prevent corneal dryness.\nShave the hair on the back above the thoracic spine, and then completely remove the hair using depilating cream. Disinfect the shaved area with iodine solution.\nMake a small midline incision (~1.5 cm) of the skin over the T11-T13 vertebra with a scalpel.\nIncise muscles and tendons both on top and on sides of the T11-T13 vertebra with spring scissors and forceps. Expose the three adjacent vertebras. Use sterile gauze pads and sterile saline to control bleeding and clean the surgical site.",
    "Stabilize the spine with the help of the two stainless steel sidebars on a custom-designed stabilization stage (Figure 2B).\nUse a #2 forcep to perform a laminectomy at T12. Carefully use the forcep to break the lamina piece by piece until the whole lamina of the T12 vertebra is removed.\nWash away the blood overlying the spinal cord with sterile saline and use the gauze pad to absorb excessive fluid. Apply pressure on the bleeding site with a piece of gauze pad to control bleeding.\nPlace a coverslip (22 x 22 mm) on the clamping bar and fill the interspace between the coverslip and the spinal cord with saline.\n4. In vivo TPEF-SRS imaging of mouse spinal cord\nMount the stabilization stage on a five-axis stage beneath the TPEF-SRS microscope.\n\tNOTE: The five-axis stage allows three-axis translation and ±5° pitch and roll flexure motion.\nSecure the mouse head with two head bars and lower the holding plate to offer enough space for chest movement during breathing, alleviating motion artifacts.\nInsert a heating pad under the mouse to keep the mouse warm during imaging.\nAdjust the z translational stage to tune the focus until the bright-field image of spinal cord vasculature can be observed under a 10x objective.\nLocate the spinal cord dorsal vein at the center of the FOV by tuning the two-axis translational stage of the five-axis stage.\nTune the roll and pitch angles of the five-axis stage to adjust the spinal cord dorsal surface perpendicular to the objective axis based on the bright-field image.\nReplace the 10x with a 25x water immersion objective for TPEF-SRS imaging.\nSet the wavelength of the fs beam to 920 nm. Tune the fs beam power to be 10 mW on the sample.",
    "Set the wavelength of the pump beam to 796 nm. Tune the power of the pump and Stokes beam to be 60 mW and 75 mW on the sample, respectively.\n\tNOTE: Spinal cord SRS imaging is performed at the wavenumber of 2863.5 cm-1, which corresponds to the Raman peak of myelin sheaths at the carbon-hydrogen region based on the measured SRS spectra7,9. The laser power is determined to ensure high-resolution TPEF-SRS imaging of the spinal cord. Tissue damage is not observed under the current imaging conditions.\nFor SRS imaging, select PBS above the objective using a motorized flipper by pressing the Switch button connected to the motorized flipper.\nSet the imaging parameters as follows: 512 x 512 pixels for 150 μm x 150 μm FOV, 3.2 μs pixel dwell time, 2 μs time constant.\nStart scanning the sample and set the focus on the dorsal surface of the spinal cord.\nFinely tune the delay stage by the OPO control software until maximum spinal cord SRS signal is achieved.\n\tNOTE: Biological samples can induce extra chromatic dispersion, the delay stage may require to be adjusted to optimize the temporal synchronization. However, when SRS imaging is performed near the tissue top surface, the temporal difference of the two laser pulses introduced by the biological tissue and the imaging window is usually small (less than several hundred fs).\nFor TPEF imaging, select dichroic mirror D2 above the objective using a motorized flipper by pressing the Switch button connected to the motorized flipper.",
    "Set the imaging parameters and start scanning the sample. To capture the TPEF-SRS image stack, acquire the TPEF and SRS images sequentially with a 1 s interval at the same depth before going to the next depth. The imaging parameters for TPEF imaging are 512 x 512 pixels, 150 μm x 150 μm FOV, 3.2 μs pixel dwell time.\nRemove the animal from the stabilization stage after all images are collected.\nClean the exposed tissue by flushing saline and absorb the excess fluid using a gauze pad. Apply silicone gel on the exposed spinal cord and wait for ~5 min until it gets cured.\nSuture the skin with #6-0 surgical suture to close the wound. Apply burn cream on the skin of the surgical site to prevent infection. Administer analgesic treatment subcutaneously (0.1 mg/kg buprenorphine).\nPlace the animal in a clean cage and place the cage on a heating pad until the mouse fully recovers from anesthesia.\nRepeat analgesic administration every 12 hours for 3 days after surgery.\nClose the shutter of OPO and fs laser. Set the power of the pump and Stokes beam to the maximum.\n\tNOTE: Setting maximal power before turning off the laser is beneficial for laser maintenance.\nSet the wavelength of the pump beam and fs laser to 800 nm.\nSet the two lasers on standby, close all the electronics control software and turn off all the associated equipment.\nSubscription Required.
