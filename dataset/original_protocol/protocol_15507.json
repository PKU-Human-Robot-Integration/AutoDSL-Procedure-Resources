    "All animal care and experimental procedures were conducted following the approval of the Animal Care and Use Committee at The George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences (Washington, D.C., USA; IACUC#2021-004). The study utilized male and female C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) mice aged 10 weeks to 5 months, which were sourced from a commercial supplier (see Table of Materials) and housed at The George Washington University. An overview of the protocol workflow is presented in Figure 1.\n1. Preparation of the spinal cord\nAnesthetize the animals using Avertin (12.5 mg/mL of 2,2,2-Tribromoethanol and 2.5% 2-methyl-2-butanol in sterile water) (see Table of Materials). Confirm the absence of a response to toe and tail pinches in the mice.\nPerform cardiac perfusion with cold 1x Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) to remove peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\n\t\nPlace the animal on a shallow tray and make a lateral incision to expose the pleural cavity. Insert a 23 G perfusion needle connected to a peristaltic pump (see Table of Materials) into the left ventricle and activate the pump. Once cold DPBS flows through the heart, create a small incision in the right atrium.\n\t\t​NOTE: A faster perfusion rate is preferred in this step to enhance cell viability. Blood should be flushed out in under 1 min. Clearing of the liver indicates successful perfusion.\nDecapitate the animal using large scissors and remove the spinal column14. Submerge it in cold 1x DPBS with Ca2+/Mg2+/0.2% glucose in a Petri dish on ice for tissue rinsing.",
    "Starting now, ensure that all steps are conducted in a sterile environment. Use hydraulic extrusion14 to isolate the entire spinal cord. Employ an 18 G needle and a 10 mL syringe filled with cold 1x DPBS with Ca2+/Mg2+/0.2% glucose. Transfer the spinal cord to a Petri dish placed on ice packs containing sufficient cold 1x DPBS with Ca2+/Mg2+/0.2% glucose to submerge the entire tissue.\nCarefully remove the meninges under a microscope within a laminar flow hood. Transfer the spinal cord to an empty Petri dish on ice packs, and using a No. 10 blade surgical scalpel, cut the entire spinal cord into 2-3 mm sections.\n2. Enzymatic cell dissociation\nAdd Enzyme mix 1 and Enzyme mix 2 from the commercially available Adult Brain Dissociation Kit following the manufacturer's protocol (see Table of Materials). Swirl the enzymes in the dish several times to ensure uniform coating of the spinal cord, then incubate at 37 °C for 30 min. Every 5 minutes, gently swirl the dish to prevent tissue clumping and facilitate even distribution of reagents.\nRemove the dish from the incubator and add 350 µL of 0.46 mg/mL DNAse I in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM) (see Table of Materials). Mix by gently swirling.\nAdd 1 mL of cold DMEM/0.5% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) and mix by gently swirling. Immediately transfer the entire contents to a 5 mL tube.\n3. Mechanical cell dissociation\nUsing a P1000 pipette, gently triturate the tissue three times, ensuring that tissue pieces are drawn up each time to further dissociate the tissue. Then, using a plugged 9\" glass Pasteur pipette, gently triturate five more times, ensuring no bubbles are generated during the process.",
    "Place the 5 mL tube upright and allow the tissue to settle at the bottom for 30 s. Once the tissue has settled, draw up the supernatant using a P1000 pipette and pass it through a 30 µm filter into a 15 mL conical tube.\nTo the same 5 mL tube with the remaining tissue, add 1 mL of cold DMEM/0.5% FBS. Using a Pasteur pipette, gently triturate three times.\nAllow the tissue to settle at the bottom for 30 s, then pass the supernatant through a 30 µm filter and collect it into the same 15 mL tube as before. Repeat step 3.3 and step 3.4 once more.\nCentrifuge the filtered cell suspension at 300 x g for 10 min at room temperature (RT). Carefully remove and discard the resulting supernatant using a vacuum aspirator.\n4. Myelin removal\nRemove myelin using the debris removal solution (DRS) provided in the Adult Brain Dissociation Kit following the manufacturer's protocol. After debris removal, add 5 mL of cold DMEM/0.5% FBS to the cell pellet and gently invert the tube three times. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 300 x g for 10 min at room temperature (RT).\n\tNOTE: If the cells will be used for in vitro studies and will remain in culture, pre-warmed DMEM/0.5% FBS should be used instead.\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 1 mL of DPBS/0.5% FBS (cold for RNA studies and warm for in vitro assays). Count the cells and assess viability using Trypan Blue.\n\tNOTE: Cell suspensions from multiple animals may be combined to increase cell concentration.\nWash the cells by adding DPBS/0.5% FBS up to a total volume of 5 mL. Centrifuge the suspension at 300 x g for 10 min at room temperature and discard the supernatant using a pipette.",
    "5. Microglia and astrocyte isolation\nLabel the cells with anti-CD11b or anti-ACSA-2 microbeads following the manufacturer's protocol (see Table of Materials).\nSort the cells by positive selection using the MS columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials). After sorting, centrifuge the sorted cells at 300 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant.\n6. Plating cells for in vitro assays\nNOTE: If cells will not be plated and will be used immediately for RNA analysis, proceed to step 8.\nResuspend the cells in 1 mL of warm DMEM/0.5% FBS. Count the cells and assess their viability using a hemacytometer (see Table of Materials).\nAdjust the cell concentration to 75,000 cells per 50 µL. Add 50 µL of the cell suspension to each Poly-L-lysine-coated coverslip11 in a 24-well plate.\nIncubate at 37 °C for 2 h to allow the cells to adhere to the coverslip.\nCarefully add 450 µL of warm DMEM/5% FBS/Penicillin-Streptomycin (Pen-Strep, see Table of Materials) to each well.\nAfter 3 days, replace half of the media with 250 µL of warm DMEM/5% FBS/Pen-Strep. For maintenance, completely replace the media with 500 µL of warm DMEM/5% FBS/Pen-Strep every 4-5 days.\n7. Immunohistochemistry\nNOTE: It is best to perform immunohistochemistry analyses after at least 3 days when the media has been replaced at least once. This ensures debris has been removed and cells have completely adhered to the coverslip.\nRemove the media and label the cells with anti-mouse mAb O4 (1:100) (see Table of Materials) in warm DMEM/5% FBS/10% normal goat serum (NGS) for 15 min at room temperature (RT) or at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: Skip this step and proceed to step 7.3 if the cells will not be labeled with O4.",
    "Gently rinse the coverslips by dipping them into warm DMEM/5% FBS three times. Add goat anti-mouse 594 IgM (1: 300) (see Table of Materials) in warm DMEM/5% FBS/10% NGS and incubate at RT for 15 min in the dark. Gently rinse three times in warm DMEM/5% FBS.\nFix the cells with cold 5% acetic acid/methanol for 15 min at 4 °C. Wash three times with 1x PBS, then label with the appropriate antibody: anti-rabbit GFAP (1: 500), anti-mouse GFAP (1: 500), or anti-rabbit Iba1 (1: 500) in 1% Triton-X100/10% NGS in 1x DPBS (see Table of Materials). Incubate for 1 h at RT.\n\tNOTE: Keep coverslips in the dark if they have already been stained with O4.\nGently rinse three times with PBS. Label with the appropriate secondary antibody: anti-mouse 594 IgG (1: 500), anti-rabbit 488 IgG (1: 500) (see Table of Materials). Incubate for 30 min at RT in the dark.\nGently rinse three times with PBS. Counterstain with DAPI (1: 1000) for 1 min at RT. Rinse three times with PBS, add mounting medium (see Table of Materials), and mount coverslips onto slides.\n8. RNA extraction\nNOTE: Ideally, there should be at least 100,000 cells to extract sufficient RNA for analysis. If necessary, cells from 2-3 spinal cords may be combined.\nExtract RNA using a commercially available RNA isolation kit following the manufacturer's protocol (see Table of Materials). For each wash step with the RW1 wash buffer provided in the kit, leave the cells in the wash buffer for an additional 2 min.\nRemove any remaining genomic DNA using DNase I according to the manufacturer's instructions (see Table of Materials). Incubate with DNase at RT for 15 min, then wash with RW1 buffer.",
    "To increase RNA yield, prior to elution, incubate the samples in RNAse-free water at RT for 10 min. Assess RNA integrity and quantity using a bioanalyzer15 (see Table of Materials).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
