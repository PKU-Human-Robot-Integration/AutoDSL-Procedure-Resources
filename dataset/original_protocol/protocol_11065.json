    "This protocol followed the standards of care developed and utilized by the Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine (ULAM) of the University of Michigan (U of M), which receives approval and oversight of all animal care procedures and methods by the IACUC. The IACUC is in full compliance with the eighth edition of the Guide. All rabbits were housed in cages that were a minimum of .46 m2 per cage which exceeds Guide minimum requirements.\n1. Methods for the Creation of Female Pairs from Newly Arrived Rabbits that were not Pre-paired by the Vendor.\nGather all of the following materials prior to pairing:\n\t\nCollect urine from a male rabbit. Do this by overturning the liner underneath the cage so that the plastic side is facing up and the urine collects on the top of the liner. Syringe off the urine and store in a sterile conical tube.\nPrepare a clean, neutral cage for the pairing to take place in. Remove the center divider so that the pair has full access to two side by side cages (also referred to as one \"doublewide\" cage). Ensure that this cage contains the following items: a minimum of 2 low-value enrichment items in addition to 2 high value, destructible enrichment items, a minimum of two hide opportunities such as a perch, hut or box, and 2 separate access points for food and water and two separate piles of loose hay.\nFill out the Rabbit Social Introduction Log (Figure 1).\nPrepare a clean spray bottle with fresh water.\nUnpack the first female from the shipping container.\n\t\nWeigh the rabbit and perform a nail trim. Mark the rabbit on the tips of the ears with a non-toxic, animal safe marker if no individual identification is available (hair coat, ear tag, tattoo, etc.).",
    "NOTE: Use a color such as blue or purple that will not be mistaken for bodily fluids such as blood or urine.\nUsing a gauze pad or cotton ball, apply approximately 1 mL of the previously collected buck urine to the rabbit's forehead and place the rabbit into the neutral cage.\nRepeat Steps 1.2 - 1.2.2 with the second rabbit with the exception of marking the rabbit for identification.\n\t\tNOTE: Only one rabbit needs to be marked for identification purposes, however, both should be marked with urine.\nMonitor the pair continuously for a minimum of 1 h and continue to fill out the Rabbit Social Introduction Log as the pair is monitored, recording each behavior observed at each time point.\nIntervene with a squirt of water from the spray bottle only when biting is observed, both rabbits are chasing each other (circling) continuously for over 15 s or fighting behavior (e.g. jousting/lunging) is taking place.\n\t\t\nSeparate temporarily and physically check each rabbit for evidence of wounding if these behaviors are noted.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Do not spray with water if one rabbit is chasing but the other one is fleeing. The intervention should only be when both rabbits are actively engaged in the chasing. Also, do not intervene too quickly. During this stage, it is essential for the rabbits to establish their dominance hierarchy and frequent interruptions and interventions can delay or prevent this necessary process from occurring.\nContact veterinary staff if minor wounding such as a scratch or pulled fur resulting in a small lesion is observed but do not separate the pair.\n\t\t\nContinue to monitor for positive affiliative behaviors indicative of pair success. Refer to 3.2 Positive/Affiliative Behaviors.",
    "Separate immediately if specific types of wounding are noted (see 3.4.3.2), for example actively bleeding lesions or any wounding on or near the genitals or the eyes.\nLeave the room if after 1 h the pair is stable. Complete two additional 10 min checks throughout the rest of the day (Figure 2).\n\tNOTE: Signs of a stable pair include clear dominant and submissive behaviors, resting together, eating/drinking and/or allogrooming (See 3.2 Positive/Affiliative Behaviors). Signs of an unstable pair include both rabbits engaging in clear dominance behaviors, resource guarding or aggressive interactions (See 3.4.1 Aggressive Interactions). The majority of aggressive interactions seen during pairing occur within the first hour, however, if a pair is continuing to display aggressive interactions, monitoring time can be increased.\nLeave the pair together overnight if the pair continues to be stable after both additional checks.\nPhysically check both rabbits the following morning by feeling under the fur to check for wounding and checking the genitals for lesions.\nIf no significant wounding is observed, perform daily 10 min checks on the pair for the remainder of the week. If the pair is maintained for the remainder of the week, consider these as a stable pair. Document this on the Rabbit Social Introduction Log and generate a Social Housed Interaction and Enrichment Log (Figure 3).",
    "NOTE: Pairs are only considered a failure if they demonstrate specific types of wounding (see 3.4.3.2) or if they cannot be left together overnight without new minor lesions being found within two work weeks. Female pairs that were separated due to aggression or research related purposes can be successfully re-paired with the same partner (if separated for research purposes) or with a new female (if separated for aggression), but adult male pairs that were separated can never be re-paired due to the risk of severe aggression. Therefore, the maintenance of male pairs is of utmost importance due to the fact that once separated, they will be singly housed for the rest of their time in the animal facility.\n2. Methods for the Creation of Other Types of Pairs including Female Sibling Pairs at Weaning, Female Non-sibling Pairs within One Week of Age at Weaning, Female Weanlings with their Mother, Male Siblings at Weaning or Adults that were Pre-paired from the Vendor.\nPrepare the neutral caging as described in 1.1.2.\nComplete step 1.2.1 and place the rabbits together.\nMonitor for 5 min to ensure compatibility and generate a Social Housed Interaction and Enrichment Log.\nProceed to step 1.1 if any fighting behaviors are seen and follow the full pairing process.\n3. Observe for Positive/Affiliative, Neutral and Negative Behaviors.\nMonitor pairs daily and record behaviors observed on the Social Housed Interaction and Enrichment Log.\nMonitor for Positive/Affiliative Behaviors.\n\t\nObserve the pair for clear dominance/submission behaviors.\n\t\tNOTE: These behaviors include (but are not limited to) behaviors in which one rabbit is displaying dominant tendencies such as chasing, mounting, grooming, chin marking or thumping and the other is accepting and displaying submission behaviors such as fleeing, allowing mounting or grooming or maintaining a chin down posture.\nObserve the rabbits sharing resources (food, water, hay).",
    "NOTE: Consider sharing resources as a positive indicator of pair stability when there is no competition or aggression over the resource.\nObserve the pair engaging in allo grooming behaviors in which one rabbit is grooming the other.\n\t\tNOTE: The rabbit being groomed should accept the grooming. Typically the dominant is grooming the submissive but this can shift to the submissive grooming the dominant which does not indicate a pair breakdown.\nObserve self-grooming behavior when a rabbit feels secure enough in the shared environment to groom itself.\n\t\tNOTE: Consider self-grooming as a positive indication that the pair is stable. If the rabbit felt threatened, it would not engage in this maintenance behavior which requires a vertical sitting posture increasing the rabbit's vulnerability to attack from a hostile partner.\nObserve the sharing space behavior when the rabbit chooses to be in the same location as their conspecific.\n\t\tNOTE: The standard cage setup provides ample space for the rabbits to stay within their own territory if they choose. When they prefer to share space with their conspecific, this is a positive indicator of a stable pair.\nObserve a rabbit engaging in solo interaction with enrichment items.\n\t\tNOTE: The observation that either rabbit is feeling secure enough to engage in interaction with environmental enrichment is a positive indicator.\nObserve the pair interacting with environmental enrichment items together.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure that both rabbits are mutually engaging in interaction with the environmental enrichment in a non-aggressive and non-competitive manner.\nNeutral Behaviors.\n\t\nObserve instances in which no interaction is observed.",
    "NOTE: There may be a pair that is always observed in a state of neutral or non-interaction. This may not indicate any issues, however, if the pair is consistently neutral and no other positive or negative behaviors are ever observed this pair must be monitored closely. Consistently neutral interactions may indicate that the pair has not yet established a dominance hierarchy and is at a greater risk of fighting and wounding behaviors as time progresses.\nNegative Behaviors.\n\t\nAggressive interactions.\n\t\tNOTE: Define aggressive interactions as both rabbits engaging in a negative behavior at the same time. For example, if one rabbit is chasing and one is fleeing, this is not a negative interaction but if both rabbits are chasing each other (circling), this is considered an aggressive interaction because both rabbits are actively engaged in this dominance behavior.\n\t\t\nClosely watch for biting, wounding, mutual chasing (circling), resource guarding or leaping at each other in a fighting manner (jousting). Treat these as aggressive interactions that must be intervened.\n\t\t\t\nWhen the above behaviors are displayed, intervene with a squirt of water from the spray bottle to distract the rabbits from the behavior.\n\t\t\t\tNOTE: Ensure that the water is never a punishment tool, rather a distraction technique. Typically the rabbits will separate to opposite sides of the cage to groom the water off of their fur.\n\t\t\t\t\nDon thick gloves to prevent injury and manually separate the pair if the water does not distract from the aggression and physical separation is necessary.\nObserve behaviors involving difficulty establishing dominance.\n\t\tNOTE: These situations are essential for observers to be able to identify because a pair that cannot establish a proper dominance hierarchy is at a high risk for pair failure and can result in wounding if it is not identified in a timely fashion.",
    "To identify these situations, look for pairs in which both rabbits are exhibiting displays of dominance or the submissive rabbit often struggles to get away from dominance displays.\n\t\t\tFor example, if the submissive rabbit does not accept mounting and instead flees away or tries to mount the dominant rabbit.\n\t\t\t\nProvide additional monitoring and enrichment intervention to these pairs to try to assist them in their hierarchy establishment.\nWounding.\n\t\t\nContact veterinary staff immediately for any wounding.\nDo not immediately separate the pair unless specific types of wounding are observed, for example, actively bleeding lesions or any wounding on or near the genitals or eyes.\nProvide increased enrichment to maintained pairs with minor, superficial lesions such as small scratches or scabs, barbering or hair pulls and monitor. Do not separate these pairs.\nWhen any of these behaviors are noted, place the pair on increased monitoring and enrichment intervention.\nMonitor for Communication Behaviors that Can Precede Fighting Behaviors.\n\tNOTE: The following behaviors are all natural ways that rabbits use to communicate their dominance hierarchy with each other which if left unchecked can proceed to fight behaviors. Observation of these behaviors is a good indicator that a pair is working through their dominance establishment and would benefit from increased monitoring and enrichment.\n\t\nWatch for Chasing/Fleeing Behaviors.\n\t\tNOTE: This is a very commonly seen behavior in rabbits to establish dominance. This behavior does not warrant intervention with a spray bottle as long as one rabbit is doing the chasing and the other is doing the fleeing.\nWatch for Urine Spraying.\n\t\tNOTE: This behavior is most frequently seen in paired adult males but can be observed in paired females as well as in singly housed rabbits. Urine may be sprayed on the cage or on the submissive rabbit.\nWatch for Mounting Behaviors.",
    "NOTE: This is a very typical dominance display with the dominant mounting and the submissive accepting.\nWatch for Signs of Barbering.\n\t\tNOTE: Barbering is usually first observed on the nose, in between the ears or on the back of the neck. Monitor to ensure it does not progress to lesions.\nWatch for Thumping Behaviors.\n\t\tNOTE: Thumping is done for multiple communication reasons. One of those is to display dominance in a decisive intimidation display of repeated thumping towards the submissive rabbit. Thumping may also be done as a sign of submission when accompanied by a fleeing behavior.\nWhen any of these behaviors are noted, the pair must be placed on increased monitoring and enrichment intervention.\n4. Methods for Pair Maintenance with Environmental Enrichment Intervention.\nTrack the ages of all paired rabbits. Place a note behind the cage card that denotes the age of the rabbits in weeks and update it once per week.\n\t\nIncrease monitoring around weeks 10-20 when problems tend to arise35. Sexual maturity begins between 12-17 weeks of age.\nWhen negative behaviors (Refer to Section 3.4) or communication behaviors (Refer to Section 3.5) are observed, increase the pair's enrichment to three times per week.\n\t\nThree times per week provide the pair with a novel enrichment item (one per rabbit) and increased monitoring documented on the Social Housed Interaction and Enrichment Log.\nIf negative behaviors or communication behaviors worsen or new behaviors are observed, increase the pair's enrichment to daily.\n\t\nEach day (including weekends and holidays) provide the pair with a novel enrichment item (one per rabbit) and associated monitoring documented on the Social Housed Interaction and Enrichment Log.\nEnrichment guidelines.\n\t\nBefore the use of any enrichment item receive clearance from institutional enrichment committee and/or veterinary staff.",
    "Provide a minimum of one enrichment item per rabbit in each pair that is rotated bi-weekly and loose hay daily32.\nEnsure that all paper and cardboard enrichment items are autoclaved prior to use as per institutional policy.\nRemove old enrichment items before adding a new one so that each rabbit does not have more than two items at a time.\nRotate the categories of enrichment to maintain novelty (See Figure 4).\nSubscription Required.
