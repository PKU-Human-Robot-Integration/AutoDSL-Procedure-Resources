Examples of mice bearing soft PDADX tumor and hard PDADX tumor are shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting].\nNote: PDADX tumor formation is generally observed 6-months post-implantation. As approved by our SingHealth IACUC protocol, the humane end-point for mouse maintenance is 6 months.\nPassaging PDADX tumors in mouse models\nTiming: 2 h\nUpon successful establishment of PDADX tumors in mice (P0), tumors will be passaged into the next generation of mice. The objective of this step is to maintain PDADX tumor in mice by serial passaging. A minimum of 5 mice are suggested to be implanted to harvest PDADX tumors for downstream activities.\nSacrifice mouse bearing PDADX tumor through cervical dislocation under anesthesia.\nCollect PDADX tumor from the sacrificed mouse.",
    "For soft tumors that can pass through a 23 G syringe needle, transfer at least 600 mg tumor to a sterile tube or a culture dish (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C) and mix well using a syringe.\nFor solid tumors that are too large to pass through a 23 G syringe needle,\nExcise a piece of tumor using an autoclaved pair of scissors and forceps (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]D).\nPlace tumor on a culture dish (Nunc, Catalog No.: 150288) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]E).\nMince tumor into fine pieces using a sterile scalpel (Swann-Morton, Catalog No.: 0201) (Figures 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]F and 3G).\nTransfer minced tumor to a sterile tube using a syringe (B.Braun, Catalog No.: 9161406V) (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]H).\nTransfer 100 mg tumor into a sterile tube for each mouse (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]I).\nAdd 400 μL of matched filter-sterilized cell-free ascites to the tube.\nResuspend tumor cells by passing through a 23 G syringe needle repeatedly (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]J).\nNote: As a minimum of 5 mice are recommended to be implanted, a master mix of soft / hard tumor corresponding to volumes necessary for 5 mice, i.e., 500 mg tumor and 2 mL matched filter-sterilized cell-free ascites, will be useful to reduce variations between PDADX tumors injected into each mouse. The resuspended tumor is ready for implantation when a homogenous mixture is formed (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]K).\nImplant approximately 500 μL mixture (corresponding to 100 mg tumor) into each mouse via intraperitoneal injection using a 23 G syringe needle (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]L).\nCritical: The success rate of obtaining PDADX tumor at the passaging stage is close to 100%.\nInject 100 μL of 5% filter-sterilized cell-free ascites into each mouse via intraperitoneal injection using a 31 G syringe needle, repeating the injection every three days.\nMaintain implanted mice for PDADX tumor formation.",
    "Monitor mice during routine ascites injection and decide if tumor has developed by observing abdomen size or presence of tumor nodules for soft and hard tumors, respectively (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: PDADX tumor formation takes approximately 4–5 serial passages before the tumor development rate stabilizes to approximately 3–4 weeks (P4 to 5), depending on the aggressiveness of patient cancer cells.\nUpon observable PDADX tumor formation, please follow steps 5–13 to perform serial passaging or proceed to collect the tumor for drug efficacy evaluation.\nHarvesting of tumor for cryopreservation and subsequent revival of PDADX tumors\nTiming: 2 days\nThe objective of this step is to harvest PDADX tumor specimens for cryopreserved stocks and subsequent analyses such as genomic sequencing, morphological characterization and implantation into mice for evaluation of drug efficacy.\nTo cryopreserve PDADX tumor.\nTransfer 100 mg tumor to a cryogenic vial.\nNote: Different methods are applied to collect and process soft and hard tumors, please refer to step 6.\nAdd 1 mL freezing medium to the vial.\nResuspend tumor cells by passing through a 23 G syringe needle repeatedly.\nStore the cryogenic vials in a freezing container at −80°C for 12–18 h.\nTransfer the frozen vials to liquid nitrogen for long-term storage.\nPause point: The frozen tumor cells can be kept in liquid nitrogen for at least 8 years.\nCritical: This step is critical to revive early passages of the PDADX model. At least 10 vials of cryopreserved stocks for each passage are suggested to be stored for further implantation.\nTo revive PDADX tumor in mice.\nThaw one cryopreserved stock of PDADX tumor in a 37°C water bath for 2 min.\nTransfer the mixture to a sterile 50 mL PP centrifuge tube.\nWash with 20 mL 1× PBS.",
    "Note: 1× PBS should be filter-sterilized with a 0.22 μm filter unit (Thermo Scientific, Catalog No.: 567-0020) and stored at 4°C to be used within 1 year.\nCentrifuge at 500 g for 5 min with maximum brake setting using Eppendorf benchtop centrifuge 5810 affixed with Eppendorf A-4-62 swing bucket rotor.\nRemove supernatant.\nAdd 400 μL matched filter-sterilized cell-free ascites.\nResuspend tumor cells by passing through a 23 G syringe needle repeatedly.\nImplant approximately 500 μL mixture (corresponding to 100 mg tumor) into each mouse via intraperitoneal injection using a 23 G syringe needle.\nFollow steps 11–14 to maintain the implanted mice.\nEvaluation of drug efficiency utilizing PDADX mouse models\nTiming: 22 days\nThe objective of this step is to evaluate efficiency of drugs in inhibiting PDADX tumor growth in the matched ascitic microenvironment, which recapitulates the tumor microenvironment in PC patients.\nCritical: Each drug treatment group should include at least 5 mice.\nDay 1\nSacrifice mouse bearing PDADX tumor through cervical dislocation under anesthesia.\nCollect sufficient tumor for the experiment. For this protocol, 2.5 g of tumor is collected for a 20-mice experiment.\nNote: Different methods are applied to collect soft and hard tumors, please refer to step 6.\nAliquot 100 mg ± 1 mg tumor in each sterile tube.\nCritical: Amount of tumor for implantation should be determined for each PDADX model with appropriate experiment schedule. The indicated amount is applied for a 22-day experiment using PDADX models with an average growth rate of 1 month / passage.\nAdd 400 μL of 5% matched filter-sterilized cell-free ascites or 10% FBS treated with 1% appropriate vehicle or optimal concentration of tested drugs to each tube.

    "Note: As a minimum of 5 mice are recommended to be implanted, a master mix of soft / hard tumor corresponding to volumes necessary for 5 mice, i.e., 500 mg tumor and 2 mL appropriate solution, will be useful to reduce variation between PDADX tumors injected into each mouse.\nNote: The optimal concentration of tested drug for each PDADX model can be determined by serial dilution of drugs in the presence of sterile cell-free ascites. Add 400 μL of 5% matched filter-sterilized cell-free ascites treated with 1% appropriate vehicle or a serial dilution of tested drugs to each tube. At the optimal concentration, a significant reduction in tumor burden should be observed with an absence of signs indicating toxicity in mice, for example, drastic reduction in body weight and inability to eat or drink etc.\nOptional: Drug efficiency of oral administration can also be tested using the PDADX model. Resuspend 100 mg tumor with 400 μL of 5% filter-sterilized cell-free ascites or 10% FBS.
