    "Preparation of diabetic mice\n1. Dissolve appropriate amount of streptozotocin with STZ/acetate buffer and inject the mouse \\(i.p., 175-250 mg kg-1 body weight).\n  ?TROUBLESHOOTING\n2. Monitor blood glucose with glucose meter on day 2, 3 and 4.  When the animals are hyperglycemic \\(blood glucose > 18 mM) on two consecutive days they are ready for islet transplantation.\n  Packaging islets for transplantation \n3. Transfer predetermined amount of islets for each recipient into 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes individually and let the islets settle down to the bottom.\n  4. Collect the islets into PE-50 tubing at about the half way of full length of the tubing \\(15~20 cm) with a microsyringe, and then fold the PE-50 tubing at about half way leaving all islets in one end \\(Fig. 1).\n  5. Insert the folded PE-50 tubing into a 200 μl pipet tip, then, put into a 15ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 2500 rpm for 10 min at 4oC \\(Fig.1).\n  6. After centrifugation, attach PE-50 tubing to the microsyringe again, remove the pipet tip and cut a cant at about 1 cm apart from the islet pellet.\n  Islet transplantation\n7. Anesthetize the diabetic mouse with Nembutal \\(i.p., ～0.05ml per mouse) and shave the left flank of the mouse.  Then, swab the shaved area with iodophors.\n  8. Make a small incision through skin and muscle of the left back side of the animal.\n  ?TROUBLESHOOTING\n9. Expose the kidney outside the body using two saline-wetted cotton-tipped applicators.  Apply a slight pressure to both sides of the incision, raise or pop the kidney out of the abdominal cavity.  Keep the kidney moist by applying saline with a cotton-tipped swab.\n  10. Using a 25G syringe needle, make a small scratch on the upper pole of the kidney, creating a nick in the kidney capsule \\(Fig.2)",
    "11. Insert the “L”-type glass rod into the hole in the capsule and carefully move it under the capsule to make a small pouch \\(Fig.2).\n  12. Slightly lift the capsule with the glass rod and carefully insert the islet-containing PE-50 tubing into the pouch.  Then, release the islet-pellet with the aid of microsyringe.  Once all islets are inside the pouch slowly remove the tubing and quickly seal the pouch with a cautery.\n  ?TROUBLESHOOTING\n13. Sew muscle layer with a 4-0 absorbable suture and close the skin with a 4-0 silk suture.\n  Post-transplantation recovery and follow-up\n14. Place the mouse on a heating blanket and inject 1 ml of saline.\n  15. Keep the animal alone until it is completely recovered.\n  16. During the experimental period, the mice are allowed free access to tap water and chow.\n  17. Measure blood glucose every other day post-transplantation.\n  18. In case of graft removal for the confirmation or other immunohistological purposes, repeat steps 7-9 and excise the whole kidney after ligation of the vein and artery.  Then, repeat steps 13-15.\n  19. In case of second transplantation on right kidney, repeat steps 7-15."
