    "All animal work was done according to approved Rutgers-RWJMS IACUC methods.\n1. Solution and Media Preparation\nPrepare stock and buffer solutions as per Table 1. Prepare working solutions as per Table 2.\n2. Culture and Maintenance of F9 RARE-LacZ Cells\nThawing Frozen Cells\nPrepare F9 RARE-LacZ cell culture medium as detailed in Table 2.\nCoat 10 cm culture dishes (cell culture treated) with 10 ml  of 0.2% gelatin (refer to Table 2) for 30 min at RT. Wash off excess gelatin with two rinses of 10 ml distilled water. Immediately add 9 ml of F9 RARE-LacZ cell culture medium into the flask to prevent the gelatin from drying.\nThaw a vial of F9 RARE-LacZ cells14 in a 37 °C water bath for 2 - 3 min. Plate cells (around 1 x 106 cells/ml) into the coated dish containing 9 ml of culture medium. Culture at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Change the medium the next day.\nMaintenance of F9 RARE-LacZ Cells\nMaintain a regular passage every 2 - 3 days at a ratio of 1:10.\n\t\tNote: Do not let cells grow into confluency as this will result in their differentiation.\nSplit the cultures at a confluency of 80-90%. Remove the media and wash the cells with 10 ml of 1x phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Remove the PBS and add 1 ml of trypsin, incubate for 5 min. Add 9 ml of culture medium, pipette up and down and split cells 1:10 for passage.\nFreezing F9 RARE-LacZ Cells\nTrypsinize a 10 cm dish containing F9 RARE-LacZ cells at 80 - 90% confluence as detailed in step 2.2.2. Transfer the dissociated cells into a 15 ml centrifuge tube and spin at 200 x g for 5 min.",
    "Remove supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 10 ml of F9 RARE-LacZ freezing medium (see Table 2). Aliquot 1 ml into labeled cryovials and transfer vials into freezing containers. Place freezing container in -80 °C freezer O/N and transfer vials to liquid nitrogen tanks the next day.\n3. Dissection of E8.5 Embryos\nMating Cage Set-up and Plug Check\nSet-up a mating cage containing one mating pair. The morning of the next day, check for the presence of a vaginal plug and designate the day a plug is found as day 0.523. At day E8.5, harvest embryos.\nDissection of Embryos\nSacrifice the dam through cervical dislocation and spray the abdominal area with 70% ethanol (see Table 2). Make a transverse cut on the skin above the abdomen using surgical scissors and pull the two flaps apart (anterior and posterior) to expose the abdominal area. Make a similar cut on the peritoneum to expose the abdomen.\nLocate the uteri and release uteri from the oviducts and mesometrium using a pair of scissors23. Place the uteri in a 6 cm dish (non-cell culture treated) with 10 ml 1x PBS to wash off excess fat and blood. Transfer to another 6 cm dish containing fresh 10 ml 1x PBS.\nSeparate one uterus containing one embryo by cutting it off using surgical scissors. Remove the uterus and decidua and release the yolk sac containing the embryo using two pairs of no. 5 forceps23.\nSeparate the yolk sac from the embryo, and transfer the yolk sac to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube for genomic DNA extraction to be used for genotyping. Use a P20 pipette with a wide-bore tip, transfer the whole embryo into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube containing 10 µl of trypsin. Place the tube on ice.",
    "Repeat steps 3.2.3 - 3.2.4 until all embryos have been dissected.\nEmbryo Dissociation\nIncubate the 1.5 ml tubes containing embryos in trypsin at 37 °C for 5 min to facilitate enzymatic dissociation.\n\t\t\nTriturate gently using a P20 pipettor for mechanical dissociation of the embryo, and plate the whole 10 µl volume containing one dissociated embryo over one well of F9 RARE-LacZ cells in a 96-well plate (see step 5.1 for plating F9 RARE-LacZ cells in a 96-well plate). Culture O/N at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n4. Laminectomy, Dissection of Adult Lumbar Spinal Cord and Neurosphere Culture\nLaminectomy\nSacrifice an adult (P60) mouse through cervical dislocation.\nSpray the dorsal side with 70% ethanol and make a transverse cut using surgical scissors. Pull both flaps (anterior and posterior) apart to expose the back and vertebral column.\nUsing surgical scissors, trim off the muscles covering the spine. Locate the lumbar region of the spinal cord, below the ribs. Using the scissors, make a deep cut to sever the spine at this point to expose the spinal cord.\nPull up the lumbar region of the spine with no. 5 forceps so that the exposed transverse section of the spinal cord is facing the experimenter. Using the tips of fine scissors, snip the vertebra and muscle at the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions of the exposed end. Grasp the dorsal flap of the cut vertebra with forceps. Continue these cuts caudally until the length of the lumbar spinal cord is exposed.\nRelease the spinal cord from the vertebrae using no. 5 as well as blunt-ended forceps. Transfer the spinal cord to a 15 ml tube containing 3 ml of DMEM/F12 culture medium. Keep on ice until all lumbar spinal cords have been isolated.\nSpinal Cord Dissection",
    "Pour the culture medium with the spinal cord into a 6 cm dish (non-cell culture treated).\nUnder a stereomicroscope, remove the dorsal root ganglia and blood vessels around the spinal cord segment by grasping the ganglia and blood vessels using two pairs of no. 5 forceps and gently pulling them away from the spinal cord. Transfer the spinal cord segment to a 6 cm dish with no medium and mince the tissue finely using a scalpel blade.\nTransfer minced tissue to 15 ml tube containing 1 ml of neurosphere dissociation media (see Table 2). Put tube on ice and repeat steps 4.2.1 - 4.2.2 until all spinal cords have been processed.\nIncubate tubes containing minced tissue in dissociation medium at 37 °C for 10 min, flick the tube on the side to mix and then incubate at 37 °C for another 10 min. After enzymatic digestion, triturate with fire-polished pipettes of decreasing diameters for mechanical dissociation.\n\t\tNote: Prepare fire-polished pipettes of decreasing diameters prior to performing experiments. Take a glass Pasteur pipette and plug the wide end with clean cotton. Using an alcohol lamp, fire polish the tips of the pipettes in the flame to create different diameters: \"regular\", \"fine\", and \"extra fine\". For \"regular\" polished pipettes, twirl the end of the pipette in the flame to round of the edges without decreasing the diameter (~ 1 mm). Rotate the end of the pipette in the flame for a slightly longer periods to create \"fine\" (~ >1 mm and > 5 mm diameter) and \"extra fine\" (~ 0.5 mm) polished pipettes. Do not use pipettes with diameters less than 0.5 mm.\nNeurosphere Culture",
    "Spin down tubes containing dissociated spinal cord tissue at 200 x g for 10 min. Remove supernatant and resuspend cell pellet in 1 ml of neurosphere culture media (see Table 2). Triturate with a P1,000 pipette followed by a P200 pipette to facilitate dissociation.\n\t\tNote: Avoid introducing bubbles, which would decrease cell viability.\nTransfer 10 µl of dissociated cells into a hemocytometer and obtain a cell count. Plate cells at a density of 1x105/10 ml in a T25 flask with 10 ml of neurosphere culture media. Incubate at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 7 days until neurospheres appear 24.\nNeurosphere Dissociation\nCollect neurosphere culture and transfer to 15 mL tubes. Spin at 200 x g for 10 min. Remove most of the supernatant leaving 1 ml behind. Triturate with a P1,000 pipette to resuspend the cell pellet and dissociate neurospheres into single cells. Transfer 10 µl of dissociated cells into a hemocytometer and get a cell count.\nPlate 1 x 105 dissociated neurosphere cells over one well of F9 RARE-LacZ in a 96-well plate (see section 5.1 for plating F9 RARE-LacZ in 96-well plate). Plate 3 wells as replicates. Culture O/N at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n5. RA Assay of E8.5 Embryos and Spinal Cord Neurospheres\nPlating F9 RARE-LacZ in 96-well plate\nOne day prior to harvesting E8.5 embryos or dissociation of neurospheres, coat a 96-well plate with 100 µl of 0.2% gelatin per well for 30 min at RT. Aspirate out the gelatin and rinse twice with 200 µl of distilled water.\nTrypsinize F9 RARE-LacZ cells maintained in 10 cm dishes as detailed in step 2.2.2. Plate 1 x 105 cells/well of F9-RARE LacZ cells, but this time using culture medium without G418.",
    "Prepare enough wells for co-culture of embryos (~ 12 - 20, depending on litter size), neurospheres (3 wells/genotype) as well as for a standard curve in triplicate (27 wells).\nCo-culture of F9 RARE-LacZ and E8.5 Embryos or Spinal Cord Neurospheres\nHarvest embryos as detailed in section 3.2 and plate on top of F9 RARE-LacZ in the 96-well plate from section 5.1. In a similar manner, dissociate neurospheres and plate on top of F9 RARE-LacZ in the 96-well plate as detailed in step 4.4. Culture O/N at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nGenerating a Standard Curve\nTo generate a standard curve, prepare all-trans RA (at-RA) solutions with the following concentrations: 100 nM, 10 nM, 1 nM, 100 pM, 10 pM, 1 pM, 100 fM, by serial dilution of the at-RA stock (see Table 1) with F9 RARE-LacZ culture medium.\nAdd 100 µl of these different at-RA concentrations to F9 RARE-LacZ cells from section 5.1. Assign wells containing untreated F9 RARE-LacZ cells as negative control. Prepare triplicates of each RA concentration and negative control wells. Culture O/N at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n\t\tNote: F9 RARE-LacZ cells respond in a dose-dependent linear manner to varying concentrations of all-trans RA.\nRA Assay\nAfter O/N culture of the 96-well plate containing the standard curves and co-cultures, remove the media and fix the cultures by adding 100 µl of 2.5% glutaraldehyde (see Table 2) for 15 min, RT. Remove the fixative and wash twice with 200 µl 1x  PBS, 10 min per wash.",
    "Remove PBS and wash three times with 200 µl of the LacZ wash solution (see Table 2), 10 min per wash. During the third wash, prepare the X-gal staining solution in a 15 ml tube wrapped in foil (see Table 2). Calculate how much staining solution is needed and prepare the appropriate amount (200 µl/well).\n\t\tNote: X-gal staining solution is light sensitive. Use the staining solution within 15 min after preparation.\nPrepare a humidified chamber by placing a paper towel dampened with distilled water into a plastic container big enough to hold a 96-well plate. Add 200 µl of the X-gal staining solution per well of the 96-well plate and place the plate in a humidified chamber.\nIncubate humidified chamber containing the 96-well plate at 37 °C to allow for development of blue-colored precipitate. For E8.5 embryos, incubate the plate O/N (12 - 16 hr). For neurosphere cultures, incubate the plate for 4 - 8 hr.\nReading Absorbance at OD610 and Imaging\nAfter color reaction, remove the LacZ staining solution and replace with 200 µl 1x PBS. Measure the absorbance at 610 nm using a standard ELISA plate reader to quantify the reporter response to RA. Image individual wells using a standard stereomicroscope equipped with a camera.\n6. Subcloning of F9 RARE-LacZ Cells\nChecking F9 RARE-LacZ rResponse to RA\nBefore starting any experiments, test the response of F9 RARE-LacZ cells to RA. Plate F9 RARE-LacZ cells in 96-well plate (see section 5.1), and add 1 nM all-trans retinoic acid (see step 5.3). Incubate in a humidified chamber at 37 °C O/N.\nVisualize development of blue colored precipitate using a microscope. If color development is not uniform throughout the cells in the well (see Figure 1B, left), perform subcloning detailed below.\nSubcloning of F9 RARE-LacZ Cells",
    "Split the F9 RARE-LacZ cells cultured in 10 cm dishes as detailed in step 2.2.2. Instead of a 1:10 ratio, plate a low seeding density of 1 x 105cells/10 ml in a 10 cm dish to allow for growth of isolated colonies such that each colony arises from a single F9 RARE-LacZ cell.\nAfter two days, coat a 24-well plate with 500 µl of 0.2% gelatin per well for 30 min. Remove gelatin solution and rinse wells twice with 500 µl distilled water. Replace water with 500 µl of F9 RARE-LacZ cell culture medium.\nPick a colony using a sterile P10 pipette tip and transfer into one well; do this 24 times to obtain 24 individual colonies. Culture at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 3 - 4 days.\nSplit the individual colonies into two 24-well plates. After 2 days in culture, add 1nM of RA to each well of one 24-well plate and culture O/N. Perform LacZ staining as detailed in section 5.4 to test for high responders. Visualize color reaction of each well under a microscope to determine strong and uniform responders.\nOnce a strong subclone responder is determined, expand the corresponding culture from the other 24-well plate. Further expand that colony in a 10 cm dish, freeze down several vials as detailed in section 2.3, and discard all other colonies.\n\t\tNote: Only about one-fourth of the original colonies result in high responders. Typically, the first round of subcloning does not result in uniform LacZ staining and a subsequent round of subcloning needs to be done to achieve uniform strong responders."
