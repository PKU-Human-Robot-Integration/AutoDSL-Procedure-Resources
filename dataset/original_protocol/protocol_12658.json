    "This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District (ethical approval D. No. 217/13/03/02/2015).\n1. Preparation of EV-depleted FBS by ultracentrifugation\nTake FBS in (ultra)centrifuge tubes and place them in ultracentrifuge buckets. To ensure that the ultracentrifugation runs smoothly and safely, balance the buckets within 10 mg of each other.\nLoad the buckets on a swinging rotor (type SW28, k-factor 246). Place the rotor in the ultracentrifuge and run at 100,000 x g for 19 h at 4 °C.\nCarefully collect the light-colored upper layer of the supernatant (approximately nine-tenths) and transfer to a 50 mL tube. Do not disturb or pipette the dark brown pellet, as it contains EVs from FBS.\nPass the supernatant through a 0.22 µm filter into a new 50 mL tube.\nAdd the filter-sterilized, EV-depleted FBS to cell culture media when growing cells for EV isolation.\n2. Isolation of osteosarcoma-derived EVs\nPlate OS cells (HOS-143B cell line) in a T-175 flask with RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% normal FBS and 1% antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin). Place the flask in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nWhen the flask is 70%–80% confluent, wash the cells with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) then grow them in media containing 10% EV-depleted FBS (hereafter referred to as EV-depleted media).\n\tNOTE: 1 x 106 HOS-143B cells plated in a T175 flask reaches 70% confluency after approximately 60 h.\nDuring the next 48 h, collect conditioned media from osteosarcoma cells after every 24 h and add fresh EV depleted media.\nCentrifuge the conditioned media at 2500 x g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove cells and cell debris. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube, leaving around 2 mL of media at the bottom.",
    "NOTE: If not directly proceeding with EV isolation at this stage, the supernatant can be stored at -80 ᵒC.\nPour the supernatant into ultracentrifuge tubes and balance them as earlier. Centrifuge the tubes at 100,000 x g for 2 h at 4 °C.\nCarefully discard the supernatant, leaving around 1 mL at the bottom. Add around 20 mL of PBS (0.1 µm filtered) to the tube and pipette gently to wash and resuspend the EV pellet.\nBalance the tubes and perform another round of ultracentrifugation with the same settings.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the EV pellet in 200 µL of PBS by gentle pipetting. Store the EVs in low binding tubes.\n\tNOTE: EVs can be used straightaway or else stored in -80 °C until they are needed.\n3. Characterization of OS-EVs\nNOTE: Purified EVs can be characterized by western blotting (WB), nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)16.\nPerform WB as per the standard protocol16 with EV markers CD63, TSG101, and Hsp70, and with calnexin as a negative control to indicate purity of the EV sample20.\nFor NTA, first dilute the EV sample in 0.1 µm filtered Dulbecco's PBS to obtain (ideally) 30–100 particles per frame.\n\t\nTake around 500 µL of the sample into a 1 mL syringe and load it into the inlet port of the NTA instrument. Check that there are enough particles per frame, for accurate measurements.\nOpen the NTA software and record five videos of 60 s duration, using camera level 13 at ambient temperature. During analysis, use detection threshold = 5 and gain = 10.\nAnalyze EV samples by TEM as described previously21.\n4. AT-MSC culture",
    "NOTE: Human adipose tissue for mesenchymal stem cell isolation was provided as liposuction aspirate (Department of Plastic Surgery, Laser Tilkka Ltd., Finland). Written informed consent was taken from the lipoaspirate donors, who were undergoing elective liposuction procedures.\nIsolate AT-MSCs from liposuction aspirates using standard mechanical and enzymatic isolation methods22.\n\tNOTE: MSCs from other sources (including commercial cell lines) may also be used.\nCulture cells in DMEM/F-12 media supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics.\n5. Treatment of MSCs with OS-EVs\nPlate 15,000 AT-MSCs per well in a 24 well plate.\nAfter 24 h, remove the old media, wash cells with PBS, and change to EV-depleted media.\nTreat cells with OS-EVs (at a particle concentration of 1 x 106 EVs per cell) on Day 1 (24 h after cell adhesion), Day 3 (48 h after Day 1), and Day 5 (96 h after Day 1).\n\t\nStop the OS-EV treatment for timepoint (TP) 0 samples on Day 1, TP 3 samples on Day 3 and TP 7 samples on Day 7 (48 h after Day 5).\n\t\tNOTE: Other timepoint schedules as per the experimental plans can also be followed.\nExtract DNA from the MSCs using an appropriate method. Include positive and negative control samples for the data analysis.\n6. LINE-1 methylation assay\nDesign the customized LINE-1 probe primers, as done previously by Pavicic et al.23. For methylation probes, select three sequences containing the HhaI restriction site within the promoter region of LINE-1. For control probes, select seven sequences lacking the HhaI restriction site from the rest of the LINE-1 sequence.\n\tNOTE: The LINE-1 sequence is available at the GenBank database24 (L1.2, accession no. AH005269.2). Use the MSPA manufacturer's instructions for designing the probes25.\nDilute 70 ng of DNA sample in TE buffer to a 5 µL volume.",
    "Carry out subsequent thermocycling and PCR steps as mentioned in Table 1. Heat the samples for 10 min at 98 °C, then cool to 25 °C.\nAdd 3 µL of probe hybridization mix to each sample and run the thermocycler to allow the probes to hybridize to the DNA.\nAt room temperature (RT), add 13 µL of post-hybridization mix to each sample. Transfer 10 µL to a second tube.\nPlace both sets of tubes in the thermocycler and incubate at 48 °C for at least 1 min.\n\t\nWhile samples are at 48 °C, add 10 µL of the ligation mix to the first set of tubes (undigested series) and 10 µL of the ligation-digestion mix to the second set of tubes (digested series). Run the next thermocycler program.\nSpin down the tubes and simultaneously set the thermocycler to 72 °C.\nAdd 5 µL of polymerase mix to each tube and place the tubes in the thermocycler. Run the PCR program.\nWhile the PCR program is running, prepare a solution of 1 mL formamide containing 2.5 µL of size standard. Pipette 10 µL of this solution to each well of an optical 96 well plate (with barcode).\nAfter PCR, dilute the undigested and digested samples to 1:100 and 1:200 respectively in ultrapure water. Add 2 µL of diluted PCR product to the 96 well plate. Centrifuge the plate at 200 x g for 15–20 s to remove air bubbles.\nCarry out fragment analysis of samples by capillary electrophoresis.\n\tNOTE: The plate should be stored at 4 °C in the dark until analysis.\n7. Fragment data analysis\nOpen the capillary electrophoresis results in an electropherogram analysis software.",
    "Under the Panel column, for one of the samples, choose MLPA from the menu. Click on the Panel header and press Ctrl+D to apply MLPA to all samples.\nIn the same way, set the Analysis method to Microsatellite default for all samples.\nSelect all samples and click on the Green play button to analyze the samples as per the chosen settings.\nSelect all samples and click on the Graph button to visualize the probe peaks.\nZoom in on the peak region for higher resolution of the individual probe peaks. Make sure that all 10 peaks corresponding to the probes from the LINE-1 probe-mix are labeled. Discard additional peaks (<95 bp and >160 bp).\nIn the Genotypes tab, export the results in the comma-separated-values (CSV) format.\nOpen the CSV file in a data analysis software and sort the data into columns.\n\t\nLabel the three methylation site peaks based on their approximate sizes (L1-1m at 153 bp, L1-2m at 119 bp, L1-3m at 133 bp). The remaining seven peaks correspond to the control probes.\n\t\tNOTE: Here, values of the L1-2m probe peaks are used, which have a size of 117 bp, since that region has been used in most LINE-1 methylation assays23.\nFor each sample (undigested and digested), calculate the sum peak area of all seven control peaks. Divide the peak area of each LINE-1 probe by this sum.\nFor each DNA sample, divide the value of the digested sample by that of the undigested sample to obtain the methylation dosage ratio (DM) using the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/60705/60705eq1.jpg\n\t\tWhere: DM is methylation dosage ratio, Ax is the area under peak x (e.g., L1-2m peak), and Actrl is the sum peak area of all seven control probes.\nSubscription Required.
