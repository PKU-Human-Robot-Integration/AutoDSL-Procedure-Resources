    "All animals were handled in accordance with guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committees of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). All efforts were made to minimize the pain and the number of animals used.\n1. Adeno-associated virus injections in the hippocampus\nNOTE: Wild type male mice of mixed background (B6/129 F1 hybrid, 3 months old) were for stereotaxically injected with an AAV encoding the M3 muscarinic receptor (hM3Dq) into the hippocampus. During the entire experiment, mice were single-housed, under a regular 12 h light: 12 h dark (T24) cycle, with access to food and water ad libitum.\nBefore performing stereotaxic surgeries, clean and sterilize the stereotaxic frame and all needed instruments.\n\tNOTE: Surgical drapes could be used to maintain a sterile field and reduce mouse's heat loss.\nDeeply anesthetize the mouse using isoflurane. To do this, first adjust the oxygen flow meter to approximately 1.5 L/ min, and then adjust the isoflurane vaporizer to approximately 3-5% for induction and approximately 1-3% for maintenance.\n\t\nTo ensure that the animal is fully unconscious, pinch the mouse’s paw; the animal is properly anesthetized when the flinching response to pinch is absent.\nPlace the mouse on a heating pad to maintain the stability of the mouse’s body temperature.\nShave the top of the head and fix the head of the mouse to the stereotaxic frame. Then, apply ocular protective lubricant on the eyes, clean the surface by scrubbing with povidone-iodine and 70% ethanol, and expose the skull using a sterile scalpel.\nCalibrate the frame to bregma point, then drill at a medial-lateral coordinate of 2.9 mm and an anterior-posterior coordinate -2.7 mm to target the hippocampus.\n\tNOTE: If other brain target needs to be injected, determine the desired coordinates for injection using the Paxinos and Franklin mouse atlas16.",
    "Once the brain is exposed, unilaterally inject 90 nL of the AAV at the dorsal-ventral depth of -3.0 mm in the hippocampus using a microinjector and pulled microcapillary pipettes (Figure 1A).\n\tNOTE: See Table of Materials for the titer of AAV used in this experiment. For other brain areas, adjust the AAV volume of injection as needed.\nAt the end of the surgical procedure, close the incision with nylon sutures and apply topical antibiotics to the wound site.\nAdminister analgesics (buprenorphine, 0.1 mg/kg) systemically immediately following surgery, and 4-6 hours after.\nBeginning 4 weeks post-injection, subject mice to any of the paradigms described in the following section to chronically control neurons expressing the designer excitatory receptor.\n2. Repetitive CNO delivery using eye-drops\nAcclimate the animals to handling by scruffing each mouse 3 min daily for 3-4 days prior to the administration of eye-drops.\nDissolve Clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 5 mg) in 1 mL of sterile 0.9% saline solution (stock solution: 5 mg CNO/ mL). Keep the solution refrigerated at 4 °C.\nWeigh each mouse before starting the experiment to determine the amount of CNO to be delivered. Use 1-3 μL drop (per eye) to achieve 1.0 mg CNO/ kg body weight.\n\tNOTE: As an example, a 20 g mouse should receive bilateral (2 μL each) eye-drops.\nDeliver the eye-drops during the inactive (light) phase of mice, 2 h before lights turn off (zeitgeber time (ZT) 10). In cases where CNO needs to be delivered during the active (dark) phase of mice, ensure the presence of dim red light for proper animal handling.\n\tNOTE: Precautions should be taken to avoid disrupting the circadian (and light/dark) cycle of experimental animals.\n\t\nUsing a P10 micropipette, load the required amount (1-3 μL) of CNO solution to achieve 1.0 mg CNO/ kg.",
    "NOTE: Use a new and sterile pipette tip for each eye-drop. In this set of experiments, bilateral eye-drops of CNO were performed; however, if a lower CNO concentration is required, unilateral eye-drops could be also applied.\nImmobilize the mouse via scruff.\nSlowly expel the solution until a stable droplet forms on the pipette tip.\nCarefully bring the droplet close to the cornea of the mouse’s eye until the solution is delivered. The pipette tip should never contact the mouse’s eye.\nRelease the mouse, placing it back in its home cage.\nRepeat this procedure every day for 5 days.\n\tNOTE: This duration can be adjusted as per the experimental requirements.\nFor control experiments, use AAV/DREADD-injected mice subjected to sham treatment (eye-drops containing only saline solution), and mice injected with an empty vector (e.g., AAV/mCherry) exposed to the described CNO eye-drops protocol.\n3. Chronic CNO treatment delivered through drinking water\nMake small bottles using 50 mL (plastic) conical tubes and rubber stopper spouts; cover with aluminum foil to avoid any light-mediated effects on CNO stability.\nThree days before starting with the CNO treatment, replace regular water bottles with small bottles, containing 10 mL of regular water, to allow mice to acclimate to them. Secure the bottles to the cages using tape.\nMeasure the daily water consumption for each mouse.\nWeigh each mouse before starting the experiment.\nDissolve Clozapine-N-oxide (CNO, 5 mg) in 1 mL of 0.9% sterile saline solution. Refrigerate the stock solution at 4 °C.\nUse the body weight and the average amount of water consumed to define the concentration of CNO solution to achieve 1.0 mg CNO/ kg (body weight).",
    "NOTE: Adult male mice (~20 g body weight) consume ~5 mL of water per day (Figure 2A). Therefore, to achieve a CNO concentration of 1 mg CNO/ kg, 6.4 μL of CNO stock solution should be added to a final volume of 8 mL of water (final concentration: 4 μg CNO/ mL). Thus, the dose of CNO for a 20 g animal that drinks 5 mL water per day results in 1 mg CNO/ kg.\nDetermine the optimal CNO dose that displays the maximum effectiveness with minimal CNO concentration by testing a range of concentrations. Perform a dose response analysis to determine the optimal CNO dose for the drinking water method.\n\tNOTE: The following CNO doses were tested for this experiment: 1.0 mg/ mL, 0.5 mg/ mL, 0.25 mg/ mL, 0.1 mg/ mL, and saline. 1.0 mg CNO/ kg was first tested, based on i.p. and eye-drops protocols.\nOn day 1, fill the bottle with 8 mL of regular water and add the required amount of CNO.\n\tNOTE: This amount of water is enough for 24 h of ad libitum water access for an adult male mouse. In case other rodent species are used, first measure the amount of water consumed daily to determine the volume needed.\nMonitor the health of the animals throughout the protocol to ensure that there are no adverse side effects caused by water + CNO consumption.\nAfter 24 h, replace the bottles with fresh water + CNO solution. Record the volume consumed during the previous day.\nDispose of the water + CNO solution that was not consumed in waste containers. Discard plastic bottles and replace the rubber stoppers every day, after sanitizing them according to the animal facility guidelines.",
    "NOTE: Do not mix aqueous wastes with organic solvents. Contact the Chemical Disposal Service for instructions for storage and pick-up.\nReplace the bottles at the same time every day for 5 days.\n\tNOTE: This duration can be adjusted as per the experimental requirements.\nInclude control groups, as described in step 2.6.\n4. Restricted CNO treatment using mice’s preference for sucrose\n3 days before starting with the CNO treatment, place a small bottle containing 10 mL of water + 1% sucrose on the cage, preferably away from the original water bottle.\n\tNOTE: Use the same small bottles described in Step 3.1.\nExpose animals to water + 1% sucrose during the last portion of their active phase (ZT 18 – 24). After this exposure, remove the bottle with water + sucrose from the cage.\n\tNOTE: Different time windows of CNO delivery could be used. Additionally, mice could be placed under an inverted light/dark cycle, where the onset of light occurs in the evening hours to facilitate the CNO delivery.\nMeasure the daily water + 1% sucrose consumption for each mouse.\nWeigh each mouse before starting the experiment.\nUse the body weight and the average amount of water + 1% sucrose consumed to determine the dose of CNO solution to achieve 1.0 mg CNO/ kg (body weight).\n\tNOTE: The optimal CNO dose that displays the maximum effectiveness with minimal CNO concentration should be tested, as explained in step 3.6.\nOn day 1, fill bottles with 5 mL of water + 1% sucrose + CNO (1 mg CNO/ Kg) and place them on the cage (always at the same location) during the determined time window.\nAt the end of the restricted time window, remove the bottles and measure the amount of water + sucrose + CNO consumed.",
    "NOTE: Materials and solutions are sanitized or discarded as previously described in step 3.11.\nRepeat this procedure every day for 5 days.\n\tNOTE: This duration can be adjusted as per the experimental requirements.\nInclude a control group, as described in step 2.6.\n5. Data analysis\nPerfuse mice intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) either 2 or 6 h after receiving the last repetitive (5th day) CNO eye-drop. When CNO is delivered through drinking water, replace CNO + water with water at the end of the mouse’s active phase, then perfuse the mouse after either 2 or 6 h post-CNO access.\n\tNOTE: If light exposure could affect the c-Fos induction in the area of interest, keep mice in constant darkness during the last day of the experiments, and before the perfusion.\nCarefully dissect the brain out and submerge in 4% PFA solution for 9-12h.\nAfter PFA fixation, cryoprotect the brain tissue using a 30% sucrose solution (wait until the brain sinks), then section the brain using a cryostat.\nTransfer the coronal brain sections (35 μm) into a solution containing 1x PBS, 10% bovine serum albumin, and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature.\nIncubate the brain sections with an anti-c-Fos (1:2500) antibody solution at 4 °C overnight with constant agitation.\nAfter 3 washes of 5 min each with a solution containing 1x PBS and 0.3% Triton X-100, incubate the samples with an Alexa-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500) solution for 1 h at room temperature away from light and with constant agitation.\nObtain digital images using a confocal microscope. Assemble and process captured images with a photo editing and analysis software (e.g., Adobe Photoshop).",
    "For data analysis, outline and measure the AAV-infected area (mCherry(+) cells) using ImageJ software, and quantify the number of c-Fos(+) cells within this region to obtain the number of activated cells per area. Combine the results obtained from 3 separate sections per animal.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
