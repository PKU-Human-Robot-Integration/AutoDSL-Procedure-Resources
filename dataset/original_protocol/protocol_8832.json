    "NOTE: All animal procedures were performed under guidelines set by the Institutional Animal Care and Use committee at the University of Louisville, adhering to Federal regulations.\n1. Preparation of Low Ca2+ and 2 mM Ca2+ Artificial Cerebrospinal Fluid (aCSF) Perfusates\nPrepare 2x low Ca2+ (0.1 mM) Stock C buffer, 2x normal Ca2+ (2 mM) Stock A buffer, and 2x Stock B buffer as described in Table 1. The individual stock solutions allow modification of ion content (e.g., low or zero Ca2+) and can be stored at 4 °C for up to one month.\nFor intracardiac perfusion during dissection, add 100 ml of 2x low Ca2+ Stock C and 100 ml of 2x Stock B into a plastic bottle to make 1x low Ca2+ aCSF. Mix and store overnight at 4 °C or make fresh.\nFor perfusion of ex vivo spinal cord during imaging, add 500 ml of 2x normal Ca2+ Stock A and 500 ml of 2x Stock B into a 1 L glass bottle to generate 1x aCSF. Mix and store overnight at room temperature or make fresh.\nAdjust pH of aCSF buffers to 7.4. While keeping the aCSF at room temperature, place the low Ca2+ aCSF on ice and then bubble both buffers with carbogen gas (95% O2; 5% CO2) for 30 min prior to use and continuously during perfusion.\n2. Preparation of Ex Vivo Imaging Chamber\nWrap a heating blanket (no automatic shut off) around the aCSF bottle and adjust heat to low/ medium setting.\nInsert a dedicated aCSF perfusion line into the bottle connected to a perfusion pump and in-line heater which is controlled by a bipolar temperature controller and feedback temperature probe as shown in Figure 1A.",
    "Attach a flat microscope stage insert (152 x 102 mm) to the 2-photon excitation/confocal microscope stage fitted with a spill container.\nPlace a large open-bath perfusion chamber (W x L x H; 12 x 24 x 8 mm) into the spill container to accommodate and provide continuous flow of fresh oxygenated aCSF to the ex vivo spinal cord (see Figure 1B for a suitable ex vivo imaging chamber design).\nConnect the in-line heater’s metal output port to the ex vivo imaging chamber using suitable tubing. Place a thin absorbent pad underneath the ex vivo imaging chamber to help maintain the temperature of the buffer/tissue during imaging.\nAdhere the ex vivo imaging chamber to the bottom of the spill container/stage insert using removable sticky tack. The malleability of the sticky tack will allow the chamber to be adjusted as needed to ensure the objective’s light path is perpendicular to the tissue surface. If necessary, use a bullseye level to adjust the chamber.\nSecure an in-line heater feedback temperature probe near the chamber fluid inlet and a stainless steel suction tube connected to a vacuum line at the chamber outlet. Magnetic tape and appropriate micropipette holders are useful in this regard. Turn on the vacuum source.\nTurn on the perfusion pump to start filling the imaging chamber with oxygenated aCSF. Set the perfusion pump to 1.5-2 ml per min.\nControl the volume of aCSF in the imaging chamber by adjusting the vacuum line. It is important that there be enough aCSF in the imaging chamber to cover the spinal cord segment and allow sufficient working distance between a water dipping objective and the tissue surface. Myelin and axons can be detrimentally affected if the tissue segment is not completely submersed in fresh oxygenated aCSF leading to experimenter-induced artifacts.",
    "Adjust the in-line heater temperature controller so that perfusate temperature in the imaging chamber is near room temperature.\n3. Dissection of Adult Murine Cervical Spinal Cord\nEuthanize an adult 6-10 week old thy1-YFP transgenic mouse (use appropriate strain that has fluorescent protein expression in dorsal root ganglion neurons) by injecting an overdose of the anesthesia sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection.\nOnce under the proper level of anesthesia (e.g., no reaction to toe pinch and loss of blink reflex), carefully shave the skin overlying the spinal cord and brain with surgical clippers. Cleanse skin using betadine and 70% ethanol pads.\nSpray chest/abdomen area with 70% ethanol, then perfuse the subject transcardially using chilled, carbogen-bubbled low Ca2+ aCSF. (See Figure 1C for suggested dissection bench top set up).\nAs the liver pales, secure the perfusion needle into the heart using a small clip. Turn the subject over to access the shaved dorsal side of the subject and wipe the shaved area with 70% ethanol.\nMake a dorsal skin incision along the midline starting from the nose to hip using dissection scissors to expose the brain and vertebral column (Figure 2A). Secure the preparation by placing pins at the nose and haunch.\nUsing a dissection microscope from this point on, firmly cut across the dorsal surface of the skull at the level of the olfactory bulbs. Insert one of the scissor tips into the lateral edges of the incision and cut along the edges of the skullcap bilaterally until the cerebellum.\n\tNOTE: Do not completely excise the skullcap as it is needed later to lift the overlying tissue from the spinal cord throughout the dissection (see Figure 2B).",
    "Lift the skullcap to expose the brain. Gently cut the left and right edges of the interparietal bone (located at the cerebellum) and pull it back caudally to expose the brainstem/spinal cord (Figure 2C).\nUse fine tipped scissors held at a 45° angle to the table surface and cut the vertebrae bilaterally just inferior to the posterior nerve roots.\n\tNOTE: Avoid contact with the bright white dorsal columns. These fibers are the ones that will be imaged (Figure 2D) and can be easily damaged.\nLift the skullcap and dorsal surface of the vertebral column with fine tipped forceps, gently pulling the overlying tissue in one piece as cuts are made to expose the spinal cord. Continue to cut vertebrae to the upper thoracic level to isolate a 1-2 cm segment of the cervical cord for subsequent imaging (Figure 2E).\nUse scissors to cut the tissue/bone parallel to the vertebral column and clear tissue underneath the column. Make these cuts as level as possible. It is very important that the tissue lies flat in the chamber so that the cord is level for imaging.\nUse a #11 scalpel to transect the brain stem (past the termination of the gracile fasciculus fibers) and at the upper thoracic level to isolate the cervical spinal cord segment (See Figure 2F). Use scissors to cut tissue/bone at these same two points. The isolated tissue should contain 2/3 of the vertebral column encompassing the caudal brainstem, cervical enlargement, and upper thoracic spinal cord (Figure 2G).\nPlace the isolated spinal column into a petri dish of carbogen-bubbled, chilled low Ca2+ aCSF. If needed, trim the tissue underneath the spinal column until it lies flat in the dish.",
    "Transfer the isolated spinal column to the ex vivo imaging chamber and gradually increase the perfusate temperature over 1 hr to 36 - 37 °C. Maintain this temperature during imaging.\n4. Placement of Ex Vivo Spinal Cord into Imaging Chamber and Myelin Labeling with Nile Red\nCarefully secure the vertebral column in the imaging chamber with an appropriate fitting slice hold down modified with a vertical grid platform consisting of fine Lycra threads (remove middle threads of grid platform to allow space for the spinal cord; see Figure 3A).\nThaw an aliquot of Nile Red (5 mM stock in DMSO and 0.22 μm filtered; can be stored for 1 month at 4 °C, or 6 months at -20 °C in the dark). Just before adding Nile Red to the imaging chamber, reduce the flow of the perfusion pump and adjust the vacuum line to ensure the fluid in the chamber always covers the spinal cord.\nAdd 5-10 µl Nile Red stock solution to the imaging chamber near the caudal end of the cord (Figure 3B). Use a 1 ml pipette to gently mix Nile Red throughout the chamber. Allow Nile Red to stay in chamber for 1-2 min, then place vacuum line back and adjust perfusion pump to 1.5-2 ml per min to continuously perfuse the spinal cord.\nCarefully raise the microscope stage and align the objective with the center of the spinal cord segment and medially over the dorsal columns until the water immersion objective is approximately 10 mm from the surface of the aCSF in the chamber. Use the microscope nosepiece focus wheel to slowly bring the objective down until it gently touches the surface of the aCSF. Use an epifluorescent light source to focus the dorsal columns into the field of view (Figure 3C).",
    "5. Ex Vivo Imaging of the Mouse Spinal Cord with TPLSM and Laser-induced Spinal Cord Injury (LiSCI)\nNOTE: The posterior vein provides a useful marker to center the tissue as the gracile fasciculus fibers (originate from cell body of dorsal root ganglia and ascend from T6 and below along the midline of spinal cord) run parallel to this blood vessel. The thicker YFP+ cervical dorsal root projections also provide a useful marker as the fibers ascend and descend laterally to the YFP+ gracile fasciculus fibers that are smaller in diameter.\nOnce the spinal cord tissue is aligned appropriately, switch to laser scanning mode to perform baseline imaging of the ascending gracile fasciculus myelinated fibers. To excite both YFP and Nile Red, use a two-photon laser source tuned to 950 nm wavelength (~17 mW measured at the exit of a 25X, 1.1 NA objective) and appropriate dichroics (DM) and bandpass filters to isolate the fluorescent emission of the fluorophores (we use 525/50 DM560, 600/60 DM640, and 685/70, to separate YFP, and Nile Red into yellow-orange, and extended red channels, respectively).\n\t\nIf more than 3% of the axons show axonal spheroids during baseline imaging (30-60 min), discard the preparation due to experimenter-induced artifacts.\nInduce a LiSCI by magnifying the field of view to 30.3X (to create a ~20 μm diameter ablation). Tune the laser to 800 nm, and increase the power of the laser to ~110 mW at the sample. Allow 5 complete field of view laser scans to ensure fibers are completely transected.",
    "Confirm LiSCI by changing laser settings back to imaging settings (950 nm, 17 mW at the sample, 2.08X) and scan the tissue to visualize the ablation. Verify the diameter of the ablation and that the primary ablated axons are completely transected (see Figure 3D). Use time-lapse settings on the microscope combined with z capture to record the dynamic response of axons and myelin to injury up to 8-10+ hr after injury.\n\tNOTE: If the ablation is incomplete (i.e., incomplete transection of fibers), discard the preparation, as determination of primary and secondary injury mechanisms will be confounded. In addition, isolated spinal cord segments can be imaged up to 24 hr post-LiSCI with only mild to moderate LiSCI-independent tissue damage.\nSubscription Required.
