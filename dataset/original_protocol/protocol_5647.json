    "Software setupCalibrationUnder the ‘Mode’ tab located in the upper left corner of VideoMot2 software program, select ‘Calibration’ (Figure 2).Hit the button for ‘Calibration’.Draw a line across the diameter of the Barnes maze platform. Enter 1,220 mm in the box for ‘Real length’. This corresponds to the actual diameter of the Barnes maze.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180226/20180226224144_9074.jpgFigure 2. Screenshot of VideoMot2 analysis softwareDefine experimental regionUnder the ‘Mode’ tab in the VideoMot2 program, select ‘Experimental regions’.Use the draw tools located at the bottom of the display window to make a circle that covers the entire Barnes platform. This defines the region where the mouse will be tracked by the software.Define informational regionUnder the ‘Mode’ tab in the VideoMot2 program, select ‘Informational regions’. Use the draw tools to make a circle around the hole covering the escape tunnel.MeasurementSelect ‘Measurement’ from the ‘Mode’ tab.Enter 00:03:00 in the white box to the right of the text ‘Autostop at’. Make sure that the white box to the left of the ‘Autostop at’ text is checked off. This will insure that the video tracking software automatically stops each trial after 3 min.Click on the ‘Start’ button located in the lower right corner of the display window.Enter relevant study information (Study number, etc.) when prompted.Click the spacebar once to start the background measurement and then again to conclude it. During the background measurement, make sure that there is no movement or change in lighting in view of the camera.Enter trial data (Animal #, Group) when prompted.Click the spacebar once to begin tracking the mouse. In the video display, a cross will be superimposed on the mouse’s body and will follow its movements in the maze. Click the spacebar again to end the trial.",
    "To save data for each trial, select ‘Save track as’ under the ‘File’ tab located in the upper left corner of the screen.Barnes maze procedure (Figure 3)Habituation (Day 1)Attach the escape tunnel to the platform and add one piece of clean tissue paper for each mouse habituation trial. The surrounding visual cues should be in place. These cues should remain unaltered for the habituation, acquisition, and probe trial phases.Place mouse in the escape tunnel for 1 min.Put mouse in the center of the apparatus. Allow it to explore until it enters the escape tunnel or 5 min elapses.Clean the apparatus and escape tunnel with 70% ethanolAcquisition training (Days 1-10)Allow an interval of at least 1 h between habituation and the onset of acquisition training. Attach the escape tunnel to the platform at a location different from that used for the habituation trial. The position of the escape tunnel remains at this fixed location relative to spatial cues in the room for the duration of training. Add one piece of clean tissue paper to the escape tunnel for each mouse acquisition trial.Training consists of two acquisition trials daily (3 min limit per trial; intertrial interval ~1 h) with the starting location varied pseudorandomly among the four quadrants.At the start of each trial, the mouse is placed in a gray PVC start chamber located in the center of one of the four quadrants. After a 15 sec period, the start chamber is lifted (Figure 3B), and the mouse is allowed to explore the maze. During each trial, loud white noise (90 dB) is played through a loudspeaker to induce escape behavior. The trial concludes when the mouse enters the escape tunnel (Figure 3D) or 3 min elapses.",
    "If a mouse fails to find the escape tunnel within the 3 min period, it is placed in the tunnel by the researcher and allowed to stay there for 15 sec prior to removal.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180226/20180226224452_1389.jpgFigure 3. Barnes maze procedure. A. Experimental timeline; B-D. Images of a mouse being released from the start chamber (B), checking a hole (C), and entering the escape tunnel (D).Following each trial, the maze and escape tunnel are cleaned with 70% ethanol.For each trial, a number of parameters are recorded to assess performance. These include the latency to locate (primary latency) and enter (total latency) the escape tunnel, along with the number of incorrect holes checked prior to locating (primary errors) and entering (total errors) the tunnel. Errors are defined as checking any hole that does not contain the escape tunnel and are scored live using a tally counter. The distance traveled (path length) prior to locating the escape tunnel and total distance for each trial are also chronicled. In addition, we also make note of the location of the first hole checked relative to the escape tunnel (primary hole distance) by a given mouse during each trial. For this measure, values range from 0 (target hole) to 20 (directly opposite the target hole). Finally, for each trial, the search strategy is classified as spatial, serial, or random (Figure 4). Trials where mice have scores of 3 or less for both primary errors and primary hole distance are defined as spatial searches (Video 1). Trials in which mice spent the majority of the time on the periphery performing systematic hole searches in a clockwise or counterclockwise manner are classified as a serial searches (Video 2).",
    "All other trials are considered random searches, including those in which mice failed to enter the escape tunnel within the 3-min trial period (Video 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180226/20180226224540_5631.jpgFigure 4.

Random search strategy  Probe trialThree days after the final session of acquisition training, mice undergo a 1 min probe trial in which the escape tunnel is removed from the apparatus.The probe trial is administered in a similar manner to the acquisition trials, except that the start chamber is placed in the center of the apparatus, rather than the center of any given quadrant.For the probe trial, the latency and distance traveled (path length) prior to reaching to previous escape tunnel location are recorded, along with the primary hole distance, total distance traveled, number of target hole checks, and number of incorrect holes checks."
