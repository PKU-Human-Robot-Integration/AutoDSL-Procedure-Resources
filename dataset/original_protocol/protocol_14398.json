    "Porcine brains were obtained as byproducts of the Danish food industry. Danish Slaughterhouses are under strict supervision and observation by the Danish Ministry of Environment and Food.\nRats used for isolation of astrocytes were bred and group-housed in the local animal facility at an ambient temperature of 22 °C-23 °C and on a 12/12 h dark/light cycle under inspection of the veterinarian and according to Danish regulations for lab animals. The rats were euthanized before they were sacrificed in accordance with international guidelines on the ethical use of animals (European Communities Council Directive of 24 November 1986; 86/609/EEC) and Danish guidelines. No in vivo experiments on animals or human material were used in these experiments.\nNOTE: Following is a pBEC main protocol describing (Step 1) purification, (Step 2) cultivation and (Step 3) TEER measurements. For setup of a NCC with astrocytes, an alternate protcol (Step 4) describing purification and cultivation of rat and porcine astrocytes is presented.\n1. Purification of Porcine Brain Capillaries\nCollect 8-10 brains from 5-6-month-old domestic pigs (e.g. from a nearby slaughterhouse) and transport them on ice to the laboratory. We recommend starting the following purification procedure within 2-3 h of termination of the animal.\nPlace the brains in a sterile flow bench and gently wash them with 1 L PBS in a beaker placed on ice.\nCarefully remove meninges from one brain at a time using fine-tip forceps and transfer the meninges-free brains to another 1 L beaker with PBS placed on ice. Extending the time taken can complicate the removal. The approximate time used for each brain should be 10-15 min.",
    "Using a scalpel, scrape off grey matter from one brain at a time and transfer the isolated material to Petri dishes (8.8 cm2) containing 20 mL DMEM Nutrient Mixture F-12 (DMEM/F-12) placed on ice. Isolate as much grey matter as possible without withdrawing white matter material. For initial fragmentation, run the grey matter material through a 50-mL syringe without a needle. Continue for all the brains and pool the collected grey matter material. Extending the time taken can complicate the removal. The approximate time used for each brain should be 10-15 min.\nTransfer the isolated grey matter material to the grinder tube of a hand-held tissue homogenizer in a ratio of 50/50 with DMEM/F-12 media. Homogenize the material by making 8 up and down strokes with a loose pestle, followed by 8 up and down strokes with a tight pestle. Continue until all isolated material has been homogenized, then transfer the homogenate to a 500-mL bottle and dilute with DMEM/F-12 to approximately 450 mL total volume.\nFilter the homogenate using a 500-mL blue-cap bottle with filter holder and 140 µm filter-mesh, and isolate capillaries by running the tissue through the filter. Use one filter per 50 mL of homogenate and wash each filter with DMEM/F-12 afterwards.\nPlace the capillary-containing filters in Petri dishes with a digestion solution of trypsin/EDTA (2.5 % trypsin, 0.1 nM EDTA in PBS), collagenase CLS2 (2,000 U/mL) and DNase 1 (3,400 U/mL) in DMEM/F-12. Use 1 Petri dish (8.8 cm2, 20 mL solution) per 3 filter meshes.\nPlace the Petri dishes at 37 °C for 1 h on an orbital shaker at 180 rpm or stir them gently every 10 min. After 1 h, wash off the capillaries from the filters with suspension from the Petri dish using a 1 mL pipette.",
    "Split the suspension from the 3 dishes into 2 50-mL tubes and stop the digestion by adding 10 mL DMEM/F-12 to each 50-mL tube.\nCentrifuge the cell-suspensions at 250 x g, 4 °C for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatants and re-suspend each pellet in 10 mL of DMEM/F-12. Add a further 20 mL of DMEM/F12 to each tube. Repeat this centrifuge step twice.\nLet the tubes cool down on ice for 5 min and transfer the solutions to 2 new 50 mL tubes.\nCentrifuge the cell-suspensions at 250 x g, 4 °C for 5 minutes, and re-suspend each pellet in 8 - 10 mL (approximately 1 mL/brain used) of freezing solution consisting of 10% DMSO in FBS.\nTransfer the cell suspension to cryovials, using 1 mL per cryovial. On average, a purification results in 1 vial per brain used, on average providing endothelial cells for 12-16 inserts. Place the vials in a freezing box at -80 °C for at least 4 h up to overnight. Afterwards, store the cryovials in a cryotank with liquid nitrogen.\n\tCaution: Liquid nitrogen has extremely low temperatures. Please wear appropriate protection.\n2. Cultivation of Primary pBECs (8-10 days)\nInitial Culture (3-5 days)\nDay 1\nTo optimize the conditions for attachment of pBECs, perform coating of a T75 flask by adding a solution with final concentrations of collagen IV (150 µg/mL) and fibronectin (50 µg/mL) in ddH2O to the flask, making sure that the solution covers the whole surface. Use 10 mL for each T75 flask. Incubate at 37 °C for 2 h.\n\t\tNOTE: The coating can be performed just before use or up to a week before and stored with PBS at 4 °C. The coating must not dry out, or it will no longer form a suitable attachment and growth surface.",
    "Prepare 16 mL of pBEC growth medium consisting of DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% plasma-derived serum (PDS), penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 µg/mL), and heparin (15 U/mL). Supplement the medium with puromycin (4 µg/mL) to select for endothelial cells. Be aware that the puromycin treatment can only be used for a maximum of 5 days.\nAliquot the prepared medium into 6 mL and 10 mL volumes in two 15 mL tubes.\nBring a vial with capillaries from liquid nitrogen (Step 1.13), and thaw the capillaries by use of a 37 °C water bath or by adding 750 µL of the prepared medium from the 6-mL aliquot. If thawing by adding medium, carefully pipette up and down to thaw and homogenize the suspension. When thawed, transfer the cell suspension to the 6-mL medium aliquot.\nTo remove freezing medium, spin the capillaries down at 250 x g, 4 °C for 7 min.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and re-suspend the pellet in 1-2 mL of the 10-mL aliquot. When re-suspended, transfer the solution to the 10-mL medium aliquot.\nTransfer the capillary suspension to the coated T75 flask and gently tilt the flask to ensure equal distribution over the surface. Place the T75 flask at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nDay 2\nAfter overnight incubation, prepare 10 mL pBEC growth medium supplemented with puromycin (4 µg/mL) for one T75 flask and perform a medium change. Be aware that all medium solutions applied to cells should be pre-warmed to 37 °C before use.\n\t\tNOTE: Alternatively, a medium change can be performed 4-6 h post-plating when capillaries should have attached to the surface. Incubate the cells until 60-95% confluence is achieved, usually 3-5 days from thawing. Do not allow cells to reach 100% confluence to avoid contact-inhibition that can halt further cell growth.\nDay 4-6",
    "When the desired confluency is achieved, passage the endothelial cells to permeable membrane inserts (see section 2.2). If the desired confluency is not achieved on day 4, change of medium is performed. At the latest on day 6, cells should be passaged on to the permeable membrane inserts. If the required confluency is not achieved by day 6, the cells are not suitable for experimental use.\n\t\tNOTE:Preparation of astrocytes for NCC: When setting up the co-culture model, 2 - 8 week-old astrocytes in culture (see section 4) should be prepared for the co-culture model by performing a medium change on the day before passaging the endothelial cells to inserts. For each astrocyte well, prepare 1500 µL of astrocyte growth medium consisting of DMEM low glucose supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL) and then perform the medium change.\nGrowth of pBECs on Permeable Membrane Inserts (5 days)\nDay 4-6\nPrepare permeable membrane inserts (12-well plate with inserts of 1.12 cm2 surface area, 0.4 µm pores) for seeding of pBEC by coating with collagen IV (500 µg/mL) and fibronectin (100 µg/mL) in ddH2O. Use approximately 300 µL for each insert, and make sure that the solution covers the entire growing surface. Incubate at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for a minimum of 2 h.\nPrepare 30 mL of pBEC growth medium (for media composition, refer to section 2.1.2) without puromycin.\nAspirate medium from pBEC culture in the T75 flask and gently wash two times with 5 mL sterile PBS at room temperature.\nTrypsinize the cells by adding 2 mL of Trypsin-EDTA solution (2.5 % trypsin, 0.1 nM EDTA in PBS) to the T75, and place the flask at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5-7 min.",
    "To detach the brain endothelial cells, gently tap the side of the T75 flask with fingertips, eventually leaving surviving and stronger-attaching pericytes on the surface of the flask. Visually investigate detachment under a microscope. When 80% detachment is observed, stop trypsinization by adding 5 mL of medium.\nTransfer the cell solution to a 15 mL tube using a 10 mL pipette and spin down the brain endothelial cells by centrifugation at 250 x g, 4 °C for 7 minutes.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1mL medium. When suspended, add a further 2 mL of medium to bring the total volume to 3 mL\nCount the number of cells manually by use of a cell counting chamber or an automatic cell counting system. Prepare a cell solution of 2.2 x 105 cells/mL medium, resulting in a final seeding density of 1.1 x 105 cells/insert.\nRemove coating solution from the permeable membrane inserts and transfer 500 µL of the cell suspension to each insert. On one of the inserts, add only medium and use this insert as a 'filter only' control for the TEER measurements.\nEstablish the endothelial cells either in MC, MC with ACM, or in NCC with astrocytes in the following way:\n\t\t\nFor MC: Add 1500 µL of pBEC growth medium/ACM per well of the 12-well plate underneath the permeable membrane inserts. Place the permeable membrane inserts at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and incubate for 2 days.\nFor NCC: Transfer inserts to wells with astrocytes refreshed with astrocyte growth medium the day before. Place the permeable membrane inserts at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and incubate for 2 days.\n\t\t\tNOTE: Be aware of the use of different media types in the bottom wells of the three models.\nDay 6-8",
    "On day 2, change the media on the permeable membrane inserts with pBECs. Prepare 500 µL of pBEC growth medium per insert, and carefully perform the change to minimize disruption of the cell layer. Incubate the cells for two days. Be aware that the media change is performed on inserts only, and not on bottom wells.\nStimulation with Differentiation Factors (1-2 days)\nDay 8-10\nFor each of the different models, stimulation media should be prepared as following:\n\t\t\nFor MC: For each insert and well, prepare 500 µL of pBEC growth medium containing cAMP (250 µM), hydrocortisone (550 nM) and RO (17.5 µM).\n\t\t\tMC: Prepare additionally 1500 µL of pBEC growth medium containing cAMP (250 µM), hydrocortisone (550 nM) and RO (17.5 µM).\n\t\t\tMC with ACM: Thaw 1500 µL of ACM and supplement it with cAMP (250 µM), hydrocortisone (550 nM) and RO (17.5 µM).\nFor NCC: For each insert, prepare 500 µL of pBEC growth medium containing cAMP (250 µM), hydrocortisone (550 nM) and RO (17.5 µM). For each astrocyte well, prepare 1500 µL of DMEM/F-12 supplemented with penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL), heparin (15 U/mL), cAMP (250 µM), hydrocortisone (550 nM) and RO (17.5 µM).\nFor each of the different models, perform media exchange as follows:\n\t\t\nFor MC: Carefully aspirate medium from wells and inserts and add the differentiation medium to both compartments, using 500 µL for each insert and 1500 µL for each well. Be aware that disruption on either side of the insert can affect and disrupt the cell layer.\nFor NCC: Carefully aspirate medium from wells and add 750 µL differentiation medium per well. Carefully aspirate medium from inserts and add 500 µL differentiation medium per insert. Then add the remaining 750 µL differentiation medium to each astrocyte well.",
    "For all models: Place the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and incubate with differentiation medium until the next day.\n\t\tNOTE: Be aware that for the NCC with astrocytes, astrocytes are from this point kept in serum-free medium.\n3. TEER Measurements\nOn the day after stimulating cells with differentiation medium, prepare the tissue resistance measurement chamber system for TEER measurements by rinsing the chamber two times with ddH2O, one time with 70% EtOH for 5 min and 2 more times with ddH2O.\nAdd 4 mL of DMEM/F-12 to the tissue resistance measurement chamber, connect it to the system and calibrate for approximately 30 min as per the following settings: R = 0, Test R = 1000, Mode = R.\nPerform the TEER measurements by carefully placing the inserts in the Tissue resistance measurement chamber. For each insert, perform measurements in triplicate and calculate the average Ω cm2.\n\tNOTE: For the co-culture model, TEER values are expected to reach >500 Ω cm2. If the appropriate TEER level is not reached on the first day of measuring TEER, add new differentiation factors (cAMP (250 µM), hydrocortisone (550 nM) and RO (17.5 µM)) and measure TEER again on the following day. When appropriate levels are achieved, the model should be ready for the planned experiment. Be aware that the cells should rest for at least 3 h before performing the experiment to recover after TEER measurements. After stimulation, TEER values in general remain acceptable for 24-48 h after stimulation.\n\tNOTE: An alternative and quicker method using the rigid STX-100C electrode pair also records high TEER in this model81. The flexible STX2 electrode pair gives less reliable readings.\n4. PREPARATION OF ASTROCYTES FOR NON-CONTACT CO-CULTURE: Alternative Method\nPurification of Astrocytes",
    "For each rat brain used, coat 2 T75 flasks by adding 10 mL of poly-L-lysine (5 µg/mL) in ddH2O to each T75 flask. Incubate the flasks at 37 °C for 30 min.\nIsolation of astrocytes can be performed as follows:\n\t\t\nRat astrocytes:\nDecapitate 2 1 - 2 day old rats using an approved method.\nCut the skin off the skull starting from the neck towards the nose, and cut the bone with a sagittal incision.\nOpen the skull with curved forceps, take out the brain and place it in a 15 mL tube (tube 1) with 11 mL of DMEM low glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and gentamycin sulfate (125 µg/mL).\nCarefully remove meninges using fine-tip forceps and suspend the brain material using a 1 mL pipette.\nPorcine astrocytes:\nObtain 1 brain from a 5-6-month-old domestic pig.\nCarefully remove meninges from the brain using fine-tip forceps and/or hands.\nCollect 4 g of grey matter from the brain and place the pieces in 1-2 mL DMEM low glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and gentamycin sulfate (125 µg/mL) in a Petri dish. If the pieces are large, mince with scalpels or forceps.\nSuspend the isolated material using a 1 mL pipette, move it to a 15-mL tube (tube 1) and fill with DMEM low glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and gentamycin sulfate (125 µg/mL) to a total volume of 11 mL.\nContinue homogenizing the isolated material with a long needle attached to a 10-mL syringe and suspend up and down 3 times. Wait until the big pieces have settled in the bottom of the tube, then collect 7 mL medium from the top of the tube (tube 1).\nFilter the 7-mL cell suspension through a 40 µm nylon filter into a new 50-mL tube (tube 2).",
    "Add 7 mL medium to tube 1 with the brain. Continue the homogenization and filtration from steps 4.1.2.2.5-6 until the volume of filtered cell suspension in tube 2 is approximately 35 mL.\nRemove the coating solution from the T75 flasks [step 4.1.1]. A quick washing with 5 mL PBS after incubation with poly-L-lysine can be used to ensure that the cells are not harmed by any toxic effects of the coating solution.\nDivide and seed the isolated astrocyte solution equally between the T75 flasks. Incubate the flasks at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 3-5 days.\nCulturing Astrocytes and Preparing NCC with Endothelial Cells (3 weeks)\nInitial Culture\nAfter 3 - 5 days of incubation, perform a medium change by carefully aspirating medium and adding 10 mL of DMEM low glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and gentamycin sulfate (125 µg/mL).\n\t\t\tNOTE: After the first medium change, medium should be changed every 5 days. During the first 2 weeks, shake the flasks and wash the cells thoroughly with PBS when changing the medium. This aids in the removal of contaminating microglia.\nAfter 3 weeks of cultivation, trypsinize the cells by adding 2 mL of Trypsin-EDTA solution to the bottom of each T75 flask, and incubate them at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 5-7 min.\nStop trypsinization by adding 5 mL of medium, transfer the cell solution to a 15 mL tube and centrifuge the astrocytes at 250 x g, 4 °C for 7 min.\nCarefully remove the supernatant and re-suspend the cells in freezing solution consisting of 10 % DMSO in FBS.\nCount the number of cells and prepare a cell solution of 4.0 x 106 cells/mL. Freeze the cells in cryovials adding 1 mL per vial.\nGrowth in Permeable Membrane Insert System Bottom Wells (2 - 12 weeks)",
    "Prepare 12-well plates for growth of astrocytes by adding 1 mL of poly-L-lysine (5 µg/mL) in ddH2O to each well. Place the plates at 37 °C for 2 h.\nFor each 12-well plate, prepare 25 mL of astrocyte growth medium (DMEM low glucose supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin (100 µg/mL)).\nBring the vial of astrocytes from liquid nitrogen and thaw the cells by adding 750 µL DMEM low glucose medium. Carefully pipette up and down to thaw and homogenize the suspension. When thawed, transfer the cell-suspension to a 15-mL tube and add medium to a total volume of 7 mL.\n\t\t\tCaution: Liquid nitrogen is extremely low temperature, so wear personal protection such as gloves.\nTo remove freezing medium, spin the capillaries down at 250 x g, 4 °C for 7 min.\nCarefully aspirate the supernatant and re-suspend the cells in medium.\nRemove the coating from the wells of the 12 well plates and transfer the cell suspension to wells using 1 mL per well. Incubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2.\nRefresh the medium every third day and culture the cells for a minimum of 2 weeks before using the cells for co-culture with endothelial cells. The cells can be used for co-culture for up to 12 weeks after thawing, with the optimal age being 2-8 weeks.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
