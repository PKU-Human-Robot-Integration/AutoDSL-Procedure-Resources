    "This procedure to prepare recHPL includes five steps: (A) construction of expression plasmid, (B) expression in E. coli, (C) isolation, (D) refolding, and (E) purification.Construction of HPL expression plasmidST II-fused recHPL was cloned into the pASK-IBA3plus plasmid to allow expression in E. coli. The construct contains a C-terminal Strep-tag II to facilitate separation of recHPL (Figure 1). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190628/20190628033807_7604.jpgFigure 1.

Active recHPL-ST II (1.8-6 mg) was obtained from 1 L of culture, and it showed a specific activity of 1.2-1.9 kU/mg. Specific activity of the fractions was measured using 0.11 M tributyrin emulsified in 1 ml reaction buffer as the substrate. The measurements were performed containing colipase in excess, 0.5 μg/50 μl. After addition of each fraction eluted by gel filtration FPLC in Figure 4 (0.5 μg/50 μl), the NaOH consumption was recorded at a reaction temperature of 37 °C using the automatic potentiometric titrator, pH-stat AT-510 (Kyoto Electronics Manufacturing Co. Ltd.). One unit was defined as the amount of enzyme that released 1.0 μmol of free fatty acid per min."
