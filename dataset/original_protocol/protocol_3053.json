    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nThawing hPSCs\nTiming: 30 min\nRemove one vial of hPSCs from liquid nitrogen tank and place it in a 37°C water bath until a small piece of ice remains, use 1000ul pipette tip to transfer the contents to 5ml E8 medium in a 15ml conical tube.\nCentrifuge the conical tube at 200g for 3 minutes, aspirate supernatant, resuspend the pellet with 6ml E8 medium plus Rock inhibitor (Ri) Y-27632 (10 μM) and gently transfer to three wells of a 6-well plate (2ml per well).\nGently shake the plate to seed the cells evenly and leave the plate in incubator (37°C, 5% CO2) for at least 16 hours.\nNote: We normally cryopreserve 0.5–1.0 million hPSCs in each vial that is enough to be thawed and seeded in 2–3 wells of a 6-well plate.\nMaintain and Passage hPSCs\nTiming: 25 min\nOn the next day after thawing hPSCs, aspirate E8 medium with Ri and change to fresh E8 medium without Ri, culture until cells reach 60-80% confluence.\nPassage at 1:10 ratio every 3-4 days for routine maintenance with E8 medium changed daily.\nTo passage the hPSCs, aspirate E8 medium and rinse the cells with 1 ml 0.5mM EDTA/PBS per well of a 6-well plate to remove the magnesium and calcium from the medium.\nAdd another 1 ml 0.5mM EDTA/PBS per well of a 6-well plate and leave at 37°C for 2-5 mins within the cell culture incubator.\nCarefully aspirate EDTA solution from the plate when the colonies are dissociated into small clumps or single cells but still attach to the plate.",
    "Use certain amount of E8 medium with Ri to wash the colonies off the plate and dilute the cells before seeding them in 2ml/well in ECM-coated 6-well plates. For examples, use 20ml E8 medium to passage hPSCs from 1 well to 10 wells of 6-well plates.\nNote: The duration of EDTA dissociation is determined by the morphology change under microscope that is dependent on cell line and density/confluency of the culture. The best time to remove EDTA is when the colonies are dissociated into small clumps or single cells but still attached to the plate. If the cells are overtreated by EDTA and the colonies are detached from the plate, add 4× volume of E8 medium to dilute and centrifuge the cells at 200 g for 3 min at 20°C, aspirate the supernatant before resuspending and seeding the cells with E8 medium plus Ri.\nPause Point: If cardiac differentiation is not scheduled yet, the hPSCs can be maintained in E8 medium and passaged every 3–4 days waiting for the start of the differentiation. The hiPSCs can be efficiently differentiated into cardiomyocytes even after 50 passages, as long as they are well maintained in fully pluripotent state.\nPrepare hPSCs for Cardiac Differentiation\nTiming: 25 min\nWhen hPSCs reach around 70% confluence, cardiac differentiation can be performed.\nSplit the cells at 1:3 ratio to 6-well or 12-well plates (4x104-6x104 cells/cm2) in E8 medium plus Rock inhibitor (10 μM)\nChange to E8 medium without Rock inhibitor on the next day.\nThe hPSCs should reach 80-90% confluence in two days.\nNote: There is variation of the proliferation rates among different hPSC lines. Control the cell number for each line when they are passaged to ensure they reach the required density in two days.\nCardiomyocyte Differentiation from hPSCs\nTiming: 5 min/day",
    "Day 0: When the hPSCs reach ∼ 80-90% confluent, aspirate E8 medium and replace them with differentiation medium CDM-A (2ml per well of a 6-well plate or 1ml per well of a 12-well plate), count the day as day 0 of differentiation.\nDay 1: After the cells have been cultured in CDM-A for 24 hours, count it as day 1 and change the medium to differentiation medium CDM-B.\nDay 2-4: Change the medium to differentiation medium CDM-C daily on day 2, 3, and 4.\nDay 5-6: Change the medium to differentiation medium CDM-B daily on day 5 and 6.\nDay 7: Change the medium to CDM-D. Then change CDM-D every other day in the first week, but twice per week after day 14 if long-term culture is needed. CDM-D is the medium used for long-term culture.\n(Please see Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] for representative morphologies from Day 0 to Day 7 of differentiation)\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/28-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. hPSC Cardiac Differentiation\nRepresentative phase contrast images show the chronological morphology change from day 0 (iPSCs) to day 7 (beating cardiomyocytes) under the current differentiation protocol. Scale bar, 100μm.\nCritical: There is large amount of cell death during days 2–5, it is a normal process. Shake the plate before aspirating the old medium to remove the floating dead cells and cell debris as much as possible.\nDissociate and Passage the hPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes for Characterization or Other Experiments\nTiming: 1 h\nAspirate CDM-D, gently wash cells once with DPBS.\nAdd 1ml TrypLE per well of a 6-well plate, incubate at 37°C for 5-15 minutes. The incubation time depends on the density of the derived cardiomyocytes on the plate.\nAspirate TrypLE when the cardiomyocytes are dissociated into single cells but still attached to the plate under the microscope.",
    "wash off the cells and gently pipette up and down with 2ml CDM-D per well of a 6-well plate.\ntransfer the cell suspension to 15ml or 50ml conical tube and count the cells before centrifuge them at 200g for 3 minutes.\nFor cryopreservation, see the below steps.\nFor passaging, resuspend the cells with CDM-D plus 10 μM Rock inhibitor and seed them on ECM (Matrigel, Vitronectin or Sythemax, depending on the researchers’ preference) -coated tissue culture plates at 2x105 cells/cm2.\nShake the plate on the next day to remove floating dead cells before aspirating the medium and changing to CDM-D without Rock inhibitor. Maintain the cells in CDM-D for characterization or other experiments.\nNote: The hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes have the highest recovery rate when they are dissociated and split between days 10–15.\nNote: TrypLE treating time is critical for the survival rate after passaging. If it is too short, the cells will not be dissociated into single cells and still attach tightly to the plate and could not be easily washed off via medium. Under this circumstance, increasing the force of pipetting may damage the cells. On the other hand, the cells will go into apoptosis if the treatment of TrypLE is too long. The optimal time point to stop TryLE treatment is when the cells are dissociated into single cells but still lightly attached to the plate (right before detachment). Since there is variation of derived cell density among different hPSC lines (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), the TrypLE treatment time is variable and could be determined by the observation under microscope. The recovery rate of live cell passaging using this protocol is expected to be over 70%.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/28-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Cell Density of Cadiomyocytes Derived from hiPSCs",
    "Phase contrast images show the density variation of derived cardiomyocytes among three different lines at day 10 after differentiation. Scale bar, 100μm.\nCharacterization of hPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes\nAt day 10 after differentiation, the cells should show characteristics of cardiomyocytes, such as spontaneous contraction, cardiac marker expression, cardiac action potential, which could be detected by video recording, immunofluorescence (IF) staining, and patch clamping, respectively.\nImmunofluorescence (IF) staining of cardiac markers (Troponin T, alpha- actinin, NKX2.5, etc) for fluorescence microscopy (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A) or flow cytometry (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B) are the easiest ways to characterize and quantify the hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/28-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Characterization of hiPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes\n(A) Immunofluorescence staining of cardiac markers (cTnT, α-Actinin, MHC, and NKX2.5) shows the cardiomyocytes differentiated from iPSCs at day 30.\n(B) Flow cytometry using cTnT antibody indicates high purity (95%) of cardiomyocytes in the differentiated cells at day 10 after induction of differentiation. Scale bar, 50 μm.\nIf facility and expertise are available, patch clamping can be used to detect action potentials for different subtypes of derived cardiomyocytes, and transmission electron microscope (TEM) can be used to detect the ultrastructure of cardiac sarcomeres.\nFluorescence Microscopy\nTiming: 5 h\nPassage the hPSCs-derived cardiomyocytes from 6-well plate at day 10 to a desired size of plate (24- or 48-well plate).\nAfter 2 days of recovery and growth, remove medium and gently wash cells with DPBS once.\nAspirate DPBS, fix cells with in 3% Formaldehyde solution for 5 min at 20°C.\nAspirate fixative, wash cells with DPBS once and permeabilize cells with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at 20°C (skip this step for cell surface protein staining).\nAspirate Triton X-100, washes with DPBS once, block nonspecific antibody binding with 10 mg/ml Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) for at least 30 min at 20°C.",
    "Aspirate BSA, add cardiac specific primary antibody (diluted in BSA at required concentration) for 1 hour at 20°C or at least 16 hours at 4°C.\nWash off primary antibody by DPBS twice and incubate with secondary antibody (diluted in DPBS at 1:1000) for 1 hour at 20°C.\nAspirate secondary antibody and directly incubate 2 minutes at 20°C with DAPI (1:20 diluted in DPBS by adding 1 drop of DAPI to 1ml DPBS) for nuclei staining.\nWash off DAPI with DPBS twice, the stained cells can be imaged under fluorescence microscope or stored in DPBS at 4°C (avoid light). The immunofluorescence staining can be maintained for more than one month if the cells are not dried out.\nNote: Step 29 and 30 can be combined to one step by preparing a 3% Formaldehyde solution +0.2%Triton X-100 solution for non-cell surface protein staining.\nNote: To save antibody, we recommend culturing cells on small wells (24- or 48-well plate) for IF staining. However, when using vacuum to remove the solution for so many steps during this procedure in such small wells, the cells are prone to detach from the plate even after fixation. To avoid the detachment of cells, we recommend using manual pipetting to gently remove or add solution (antibody or DPBS).\nFlow Cytometry\nTiming: 6 h\nAspirate the culture medium and wash live hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes with DPBS once, incubate with TrypLE (0.5ml / one 12-well) at 37°C for 4-8 minutes, TrypLE incubation time depends on the cell density.\nAfter the cells are dissociated into single cells and partially detached from the plate, add culture medium (1ml / one 12-well) to dilute TrypLE, gently pipette up and down to wash off and suspend the cells, make a total volume of 1.5 ml / one 12-well, move the suspension to 1.5ml Eppendorf tube.",
    "Centrifuge the cells at 200g for 3 minutes in Eppendorf centrifuge at 20°C.\nAdd 3% Formaldehyde solution / 0.1% Triton X-100 to resuspend the pellets, fix and permeabilize the cells for 5 minutes at 20°C (0.3ml / pellet from one 12-well).\nAdd 1ml DPBS to dilute and wash the suspension, centrifuge at 200g for 3 minutes.\nAdd 1% BSA (50μl / pellet from one 12-well) to resuspend the pellet and block nonspecific binding of antibody for 30 minutes at 20°C. If using 96-well plate for FACS, transfer the 50μl suspension to 96-well plate.\nAdd 50μl primary cardiac specific antibody (diluted in 1% BSA) to the original 50μl blocking solution to make a total volume of 100μl, incubate at 20°C for 60 minutes or 4°C for at least 16 hours.\nAdd 100μl DPBS to dilute and wash off the primary antibody, centrifuge the cells at 200g for 3 minutes.\nSuspend the pellet with 100μl AlexaFluor 488 or 594–conjugated second antibody (diluted 1:1000 in DPBS), incubate at 4°C for 60 minutes.\nAdd 100μl DPBS to wash off the second antibody and centrifuge the cells at 200g for 3 minutes.\nResuspend the pellet with 120μl DPBS for flow cytometry analysis.\nNote: Negative control cells (non-cardiomyocytes) need to be prepared by following the same procedure for flow cytometry, we recommend using undifferentiated hiPSCs as negative control.\nNote: Lots of cells will be lost after several steps of washing and transferring of the cell suspension and pellets, as such, at least 1 million cells (dissociated from one 12-well) are required for each flow cytometry experiment.\nCryopreservation of hPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes (optional)\nTiming: 1 h\nDissociate the differentiated cardiomyocytes from plate, see the above steps in Dissociate and passage the hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.",
    "After counting the cells and centrifuging the suspension at 200g for 3 minutes, resuspend the pellet in CryoStor CS10 with 10 μM Rock inhibitor at 10x106 cells/ml, transfer 1ml/cryovial in Corning CoolCell alcohol-free freezing container and place at -80°C for at least 16 hours, then transfer vials to liquid nitrogen tank for long-term storage.\nNote: The hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes have the highest recovery and survival rate when they are dissociated and cryopreserved between days 10–15 of differentiation.\nThawing and Recovery of hPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes (optional)\nTiming: 1 h\nRemove one vial of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from liquid nitrogen tank and place it in a 37°C water bath until a small piece of ice remains, use 1000μl pipette to transfer the content to 5ml 37°C warmed CDM-D in a 15ml conical tube.\nCount the cell viability using cell counter, resuspend the cells in CDM-D plus Rock inhibitor (10 μM) and seed them in desired Matrigel-coated tissue culture plates at a density of 3x105 Trypan Blue negative cells /cm2.\nRemove Rock inhibitor on the next day by changing medium to fresh CDM-D without Rock inhibitor.\nThe hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes can be long-term cultured for different purposes.\nNote: The recovery and survival rate of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes after freeze-and-thaw in our hands is highly variable and ranges between 40%–80%, based on the cell numbers counted before cryopreservation and day 2 after thawing and plating.\nNote: Adding Rock inhibitor (10 μM) for at least 16 h in culture medium significantly improves the survival rate after freeze-and-thaw.\nNote: When the hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes were dissociated and cryopreserved at days 10–12, the cells still have the capacity to proliferate. As such, the thawed and reseeded cells will be getting more confluent in the next couple of days due to cell proliferation and increase of cell size (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/28-Fig4.jpg",
