    "Experiments should be performed in accordance with the animal welfare guidelines prescribed by the experimenter's institution.\n1. Preparation of Pups for Imaging\nNOTE: Pups with sparsely labeled cortical neurons can be obtained by in utero electroporation (IUE) of Supernova vectors5,6. The Supernova system consists of the following two vectors: TRE-Cre and CAG-loxP-STOP-loxP-Gene X-ires-tTA-WPRE. In this system, sparse labeling relies on TRE leakage. In a sparse population of transfected neurons, TRE drives the weak expression of Cre and tTA. Subsequently, only in these cells, the expression of gene X is facilitated by a positive feedback of the tTA-TRE cycles. The achieved sparse and bright labeling allows the visualization of morphological details of individual neurons in vivo. Details of the IUE procedure are not described in this protocol since they have been described elsewhere7,8,9,10,11.\nPrepare timed-pregnant mice for IUE.\nPrepare a DNA solution for IUE. For sparse labeling with RFP, use a solution containing pK031:TRE-Cre (5 ng/µL) and pK029:CAG-loxP-STOP-loxP-RFP-ires-tTA-WPRE (1 µg/µL) or a solution containing pK031:TRE-Cre (5 ng/µL) and pK273:CAG-loxP-STOP-loxP-CyRFP-ires-tTA-WPRE (1 µg/µL).\n\tNOTE: Various proteins can be expressed in the labeled neurons using different combinations of vectors. Also, various genes can be knocked-down or knocked-out specifically in labeled cells5,6 (e.g., a series of vectors for the Supernova system are available from RIKEN BioResource Research Center and from Addgene).\nPerform regular IUE7,8,9,10,11 to label cortical neurons. For the labeling of layer 4 neurons, use embryonic day-14 embryos.\nWait for pup delivery and growth.\n2. Surgery\nAnesthetize the postnatal day-5 (P5) pup using isoflurane gas (1.0%). Perform a tail-pinch test to check the level of anesthesia. If the pup responds to the pinch, increase the isoflurane concentration (up to 2.0%) or wait until the response disappears. Maintain the pup's body temperature during surgery using a heating pad.\nSubcutaneously inject an analgesic (carprofen, 5 mg/kg).",
    "Sterilize the pup's skin covering the skull by wiping it with 70% ethanol three times.\nRemove approximately 20 mm2 of the skin covering the skull using scissors sterilized with 70% ethanol (Figure 1A).\nRemove the fascia of the skull using sterilized forceps and a clean, sterile cotton swab (Figure 1A).\nApply tissue adhesive using loading tips to the incised skin surface to stop the bleeding. Do not apply tissue adhesive to the imaging area (Figure 1B) because this makes the opening of the skull more difficult.\nPlace the pup on a heating pad (37 °C) and allow it to recover from anesthesia. Wait until the tissue adhesive has dried and solidified (approximately 30 min).\nIf necessary, apply more tissue adhesive and wait for it to dry and solidify.\n3. Cranial Window Preparation\nAnesthetize the pup using isoflurane (1.0% - 2.0%) and check the anesthesia level by a tail-pinch test.\nCarefully open the skull with a sterilized razor blade leaving the dura intact (1 mm in diameter) (Figure 1C). Use a gelatin sponge (cut into small pieces, approximately < 2 mm3, using sterilized scissors, and apply them using tweezers) soaked in cortex buffer12 (125 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L KCl, 10 mmol/L glucose, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 2 mmol/L CaCl2, and 2 mmol/L MgSO4; pH 7.4; 300 mOsm/L; room temperature) to stop the bleeding. When opening the skull, apply a cortex buffer to keep the brain surface moist.\nRemove any buffer and blood from the dural surface using a gelatin sponge. Apply a thin layer of 1.0% low-melting-point agarose (dissolved in cortex buffer) using yellow tips. Using a heat block machine, maintain the temperature of the agarose solution at 42°C until application.",
    "NOTE: The draining of buffer and blood must be performed from the side of the craniotomy while taking care that the dry gelatin sponge does not come in contact with the dura. Failure to do so may damage the dura.\nApply a round glass coverslip (No. 1, 3 mm in diameter) onto the agarose gel layer. Remove all bubbles between the coverslip and the agarose gel layer by pouring an excess of agarose gel between them. Remove the excess gel protruding from under the coverslip using tweezers (Figure 1D and 1E).\nSecure the coverslip using dental cement (Figure 1F).\nMix the cement powder and the cement liquid. Apply the mixture using yellow tips before it becomes solidified. Do not apply dental cement onto the dura, because this may damage the brain.\nAttach a sterile titanium bar (custom made, approximately 30 mg, see Figure 1G) on the cranial bone using dental cement. Align the titanium bar and the coverslip (on the surface of the dura) in parallel to easily capture images.\nCover the exposed skull with dental cement (Figure 1H).\nRecover the pup from anesthesia. Keep it on a heater (37 °C) until the dental cement has solidified (1 h).\n4. Two-photon Imaging\nNOTE: The in vivo images in Figure 2 were acquired using a two-photon microscope with a titanium-sapphire laser (beam diameter [1/e2]2: 1.2 mm).\nSet the two-photon laser wavelength. For RFP excitation, use 1,000 nm (450 mW/mm2 at 400 µm of depth).\n\tNOTE: The laser power should be reduced as the z-position moves up.\nWipe the surface of the coverslip with 70% ethanol.\nAnesthetize the pup using isoflurane (1.5% - 2.0%) and check the anesthesia level using a tail-pinch test.",
    "Attach the pup to the titanium plate on the imaging stage using a titanium bar on the pup's head (Figure 2A and 2B). Adjust the head such that the coverslip is parallel to the objective lens using the goniometer stage (Figure 2B). Maintain body temperature of the pup using a heating pad (37 °C).\nSet the isoflurane concentration to 0.7% - 1.0%.\n\tNOTE: A very high isoflurane concentration may cause accidental death of the pup during imaging.\nPlace the imaging stage under the objective lens (20X, NA 1.0) of the two-photon microscope (Figure 2B and 2C).\nApply one drop of water onto the coverslip. Use epi-fluorescence to locate the fluorescent protein-labeled neurons in the area where the dura has been exposed.\nAcquire z-stack images at 1.4-µm intervals. For layer 4 neuron imaging, set the z-width to 150 - 300 µm to image the entire dendritic morphology (Figure 2D and 2E). Use slow scanning and averaging to get clear images showing the neuronal morphology (it usually takes > 20 min to acquire the entire dendritic morphology).\n\tNOTE: The following parameters are recommended for imaging. Excitation wavelength: 1,000 nm, scanner: galvanometer type, dichroic mirror: 690 nm, emission filter: 575 - 620 nm bandpass, detector: GaAsP type, gain setting > 100, image size > 512 x 512 µm, field of view > 600 x 600 µm, pixel resolution < 1.2 µm.\n5. Recovery and Nursing\nDetach the pup from the imaging stage.\nPlace the pup on a heater (37 °C) and allow it to recover (15 min).\nFeed the pup warm milk using a micropipette at 2-h intervals and gently stimulate the stomach to allow excretion. Confirm that the pup is drinking milk by measuring its body weight.\n6. Re-imaging",
    "Anesthetize the pup with isoflurane (1.5% - 2.0%), and check the anesthesia level using a tail-pinch test. Attach it to the imaging stage.\nLocate the previously imaged neurons and acquire a z-stack image. The identification of neurons is easy owing to their sparse labeling with Supernova.\nRepeat steps 5.1 - 6.2 until imaging is completed. NOTE: The pup can be imaged up to 18 h without losing weight.\nSubscription Required.
