    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nDissection set-up\nTiming: 10 min\nIn a 50 mL conical tube, prepare 20 mL of HBSS-H as described below under materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment].\nAdd 10 mL of HBSS-H to a 15 mL conical tube. Add the remaining HBSS-H to a petri dish for tissue dissection. Keep both the conical tube and petri dish on ice.\nThaw 100 μL DNase and 500 μL 2.5% trypsin at 4°C.\nNote: This set-up is intended for the dissection of 2–4 pups for one culture. If preparing multiple genotypes at once, repeat this set-up for each genotype and label as necessary.\nDissection and tissue collection\nTiming: 2 h\nNote: Prior to beginning dissection, 10% FBS/DMEM/PS media should be prepared (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]) and an aliquot of about 20 mL should be incubated at 37°C.\nNote: A video demonstrating cortical dissection similar to the method described below has been previously published.4[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4] Please note this video example uses embryonic pups as opposed to PND 2 pups.\nDecapitate the pup to separate the head from the body.\nSpray the head of the pup with ethanol and grip back (dorsal side) of the body tightly to pull the arms outward.\nFlip the pup so that its stomach (ventral side) is facing up.\nQuickly decapitate the pup with sharp scissors.\nSeparate the brain from the skull to prepare for brain dissection.\nGently remove the skin from the top of the skull (dorsal side) by pulling skin away from the eye sockets with forceps.\nCut open the skull along the midline. Begin at the brainstem opening and continue to the anterior portion of the skull (near eye sockets).\nPeel the two sides of the skull back from the midline cut until the skull has been removed from the top of the brain tissue.",
    "Use a small scoop tool to remove the brain from the base (inferior portion) of the skull.\nPlace the brain in the petri dish containing HBSS-H and keep on ice.\nRemove the meninges, cerebellum/brainstem, olfactory bulbs, and hypothalamus with forceps (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2243-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Illustration of brain dissection and collection of the cortex\n(A) After removing the murine brain from the skull, remove olfactory bulbs, meninges, cerebellum, brainstem, and hypothalamus.\n(B) Carefully cut into the midline of the brain, avoiding cutting all the way through, peeling the cortex away to reveal the hippocampus.\n(C) Flip the brain from the dorsal to ventral side, revealing the striatum. Remove the striatum. Cut along the corpus callosum and peel tissue to reveal hippocampus. Remove hippocampus to isolate cortex.\n(D) Ensuring all meninges are removed from cortex, collect cortex into prepared 15 mL conical tube containing HBSS-H.\nUsing a dissecting scope, dissect out the hippocampus and striatum to isolate the cortex (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 1C). Make sure to keep the tissue/HBSS-H cold.\nWith the ventral side of the brain exposed and the anterior of the brain to the top, use forceps gently roll the cortical layer up to expose the hippocampus.\nFrom the corners created where the two cuts meet at midline, roll back the ventral part of the cortex away from midline to expose the hippocampus.\nInvert the brain (posterior of the brain to the top) and slide curved forceps under the hippocampus to find the lateral edge.\nDisconnect the hippocampus on both lateral sides from the cortex underneath. Also, separate the hippocampus from the tissue that is on the inferior edge.",
    "Identify the striatal tissue (inferior to the hippocampus) and use the curved forceps to remove the striatum as well. Be careful to only remove the superficial portion of the tissue as there is more cortex underneath the striatum.\nCollect the cortical tissue pieces from the petri dish and place into the designated 15 mL conical tube containing 10 mL HBSS-H (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nNote: (Optional) The collected tissues can be cut into small pieces with forceps or razor blades before placing into the conical to aid the trypsinization process.\nRepeat dissection and tissue collection (steps 1–5) for all pups, collecting all the cortical tissue together in the same conical tube of HBSS-H.\nKeep samples on ice during collection.\nFor an additional genotype, collect tissues into a second separate conical with HBSS-H.\nNote: 2–4 pups are typically used for culturing in a 75 cm2 (T-75) flask. 1 pup dissection will take approximately 5–10 min. For 4 pups, the dissection may take up to 40 min.\nNote: During dissection, tail tissue can be collected from pups and can be used for genotyping to confirm assumed genotype.\nNote: If planning to dissect many pups (greater than 6), consider performing multiple dissections so that the tissue remains on ice for no longer than 60 min.\nMixed glial cell culturing\nTiming: 1 h\nCritical: Glial culturing should be conducted in a sterile environment, ideally a cell culture hood.\nNote: DNase should be prepared before beginning culture (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nAspirate (using a vacuum suction system) HBSS-H from the conical tube containing the collected cortical tissue.\nNote: Make sure tissue is settled at the bottom of the conical tube prior to beginning aspiration.",
    "Add 4 mL HBSS, 500 μL 2.5% trypsin, and 70 μL DNase to the conical tube with the cortical tissue and invert to mix well (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2243-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Primary mixed glial culture, shaking, and seeding microglia\n(A) After collecting the cortices from 2–6 pups, incubate cortices with trypsin, HBSS, and DNase at 37°C for 15 min. Every 5 min, invert tube.\n(B) After completing incubation, homogenize the tissue with P1000 and P200 pipettes, then filter the tissue to isolate single cells. These cells may then be plated with warmed media in a T-75 flask.\n(C) At DIV 10–14, cover the flask with aluminum foil and shake cells at 230 rpm for 3–3.5 h. Shaking of the flasks will detach microglia, which adhere in a loose monolayer on the flask. Collect the media containing microglia and plate cells to a 12-well plate.\nIncubate in 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for 15 min, inverting every 5 min to mix the cortical tissue and the HBSS/Trypsin/DNase solution.\nCritical: Monitor incubation at this step closely. It is important to not over incubate the cortical tissue with trypsin.\nAfter the final inversion, wait for the cortical tissue to settle to the bottom of the conical tube then aspirate the HBSS/Trypsin/DNase solution.\nWash the cortical tissue twice with 10 mL HBSS, inverting each time to wash completely.\nNote: Make sure tissue is settled at the bottom of the conical tube after inverting and prior to beginning each aspiration.\nAdd 2 mL HBSS and 30 μL DNase to the conical tube with the cortical tissue. With a P1000 pipette, homogenize the cortical tissue by slowly pipetting up and down 10 times (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nHomogenize the cortical tissue again with a P200 pipette, slowly pipetting up and down 10 times.",
    "To a 50 mL conical tube, add 2 mL of 10% FBS/DMEM/PS media (warmed to 37°C).\nPlace a 70 μm cell strainer on top of the 50 mL conical tube. Wet the strainer with 10% FBS/DMEM/PS media to minimize cell loss or cell death upon first contact with the strainer surface.\nTransfer homogenized cortical tissue using a P200 pipette.\nCritical: A 70 μm cell strainer is required to isolate single cells from tissue.\nCentrifuge isolated cells/media in the conical tube for 4 min 30 s at 300 rcf.\nAspirate media from the conical tube being careful to avoid the cell pellet.Resuspend isolated cells in 5 mL of 10% FBS/DMEM/PS media (warmed to 37°C).\nTo a T-75 flask, add 15 mL of 10% FBS/DMEM/PS media (warmed to 37°C).\nPipette resuspended isolated cells into the T-75 flask and media.\nPlace the T-75 flask with media/isolated cells into a 37°C cell culture incubator (sterile and maintained at 5% CO2).\nNote: Approximately 2.5–3.75 × 106 dissociated single cells are expected per cortex dissected from one mouse pup (PND 1–4) when seeding cells.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nDay of culture is day in vitro 0 (DIV 0).\nMixed glial culture maintenance\nTiming: As long as appropriate for the experiment (typically DIV 14–21)\nNote: A visualization of the development of the mixed glial culture at different timepoints (DIV 1–14) can be found in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2243-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Timeline of mixed glial culture development (DIV 1–14)",
    "During DIV 1–7, a bottom layer consisting of astrocytes forms. Microglia begin forming clusters and individual cells above this astrocytic layer. At about DIV 10, microglia become dense and float above astrocytes (mainly). By DIV 14, microglia have become very dense. Yellow arrows indicate examples of microglia development. Black arrows indicate examples of astrocyte development. Scale bars for all panels represent 100 μm. Images taken at 10× magnification.\nAfter at least 24 h (DIV 1), the media should be aspirated and replaced with 20 mL of new 10% FBS/DMEM/PS (warmed to 37°C) to remove any debris.\nAt DIV 4 or DIV 5, the media should be changed again to remove any additional debris.\nAdditional media changes should be done each week after this point.\nCritical: Whenever replacing media, the new media should be incubated at 37°C for about an hour to avoid cold shock in the culture.\nNote: Microglia should have DIV 10–14 prior to collection for an experiment. Example of healthy cell culture development from DIV 1–14 are visualized in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]. During growth period, check for culture attachment and health with a microscope. If microglia fail to grow by DIV 14 or appear unhealthy, please consult troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 1.\nPreparing plate for microglia plating\nTiming: 10 min hands-on, 2 h total\nPrepare a 12-well plate for the assay 30 min before beginning microglia shake-off.\nTo each well, add one 18 mm glass coverslip.\nAdd 600 μL 1× poly-l-lysine (PLL), described below under materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment], to each well. Agitate the plate to make sure the cover glass is completely submerged.\nIncubate the 1× PLL-coated plate for at least 2 h (at 37°C).\nEvery hour, agitate the plate ensure cover glass is well coated.",
    "Near the end of the microglia shake-off, aspirate the 1× PLL and wash the coated wells with cell culture grade water. Aspirate and repeat wash for a total of two washes with cell culture grade water.\nThe plate is now ready to be plated with cell/media suspension.\nNote: Wait to remove the 1× PLL from the 12-well plate until cell/media suspension is ready to be added. If necessary, leave 1× PLL in 12-well plate and incubate at 37°C longer than 3 h. However, it is not ideal to leave plate incubating for much longer, so timing is important.\nCollection and seeding of microglia\nTiming: 1 h hands-on, 25 h total\nNote: Between DIV 10–14, microglia are ready for collection. To prepare a full 12-well plate with an appropriate number of microglial cells, plan to seed two T-75 glial cultures. Examples of healthy, viable cells and unhealthy cells after plating can be found in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4].\nCover the T-75 flasks containing mixed glia culture to be shaken in aluminum foil. Place the covered flasks on shaker and securely attach the flasks with tape (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2243-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Examples of unhealthy and healthy isolated microglia after shaking\nMicroglia were plated with a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in a 12-well plate. Images were taken three days after plating.\n(A) Unhealthy primary cultured microglia: unhealthy cells have notable debris with a lower density of cells. Cells appear darker with a less defined amoeboid shape than healthy cells.\n(B) Healthy primary cultured microglia: healthy cells have minimal debris with a more defined amoeboid morphology. Scale bars for all panels represent 100 μm. Higher magnifications of the left images (yellow boxes) are shown on the right panels. Images taken at 10× magnification.",
    "Shake the T-75 flasks at 230 rpm at 18°C–26°C for 3 h - 3 h 30 min. Check after 3 h shaking under the microscope and decide whether they will need longer shaking.\nOnce the shake-off is complete, immediately collect the media containing microglia from the flasks with a pipette.\nShaken-off cells should be collected into a 50 mL conical tube.\nNote: Shaking-off microglia from the non-adherent floating cell layer is a commonly used method to isolate microglia from primary mixed glial cultures.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6],7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7] This method yields high-purity microglia cultures, with an expected purity of > 90%.8[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]\nCritical: After shake-off, the isolated microglia must be immediately plated. If the cells/media remain still (either in a T-75 flask or conical tube), the microglia are likely to reattach to the bottom of the container.\nCentrifuge collected cells/media for 4 min 30 s at 180 rcf.\nAspirate media from the conical tube without disturbing the cell pellet and resuspend cells in 10% FBS/DMEM/PS media (warmed to 37°C).\nCount the number of cells collected using a hemocytometer or other similar cell counting method.\nNote: The expected number of microglia obtained after shaking-off is approximately 3.5 × 105 cells per cortex dissected from one mouse pup.\nAfter counting cells, media should be added to the conical such that 1 mL of cell/media resuspension can be added to each well in a 12-well plate.\nIt is suggested that the plated cell density is 5 × 104 cells/well in a 12-well plate.\nNote: (Optional) Add additional 10% FBS/DMEM/PS media so there is 1 mL of media total per well.",
    "After adding the 1 mL cell suspension to each well, tilt the 12-well plate so that the microglia are evenly distributed across the top of the coverslip in each well. Cells may also attach to the bottom of the wells, but the majority will attach to the top of the coverslips.\nNote: Note the density of the cells plated in each well. For the best results, plate no less than 3 × 104 cells/well.\nIncubate the cells for 24 h at 37°C prior to LPS treatment. After 24 h, if cells are not attached, please consult troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 2.\nCritical: Prior to beginning an experiment and treating the newly plated microglia, cells should be checked for health and attachment. Any discrepancies between wells should be noted and taken into consideration when proceeding with the experiment. Examples of plated unhealthy and healthy cells are visualized in Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]. If wells have unhealthy cells, please consult troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 1.\nLPS treatment to microglia\nTiming: 30 min hands-on, up to 25 h total\nPlease refer below to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for LPS stock dilution and Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] for an example of LPS treatment preparation.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2243_12.csv\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_2243_13.csv\nNote: For LPS treatment and during the rest of the experiment, 1% FBS/DMEM/PS is used as a higher percentage of FBS can interfere with experimental conditions. Warm 1% FBS/DMEM/PS at 37°C before adding to wells.\nNote: As a control for LPS treatment, we recommend using the same volume of 1× dPBS.\nUsing the 1 mg/mL LPS Stock (see materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]), prepare LPS treatments according to Tables 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2].\nNote: Revise the components of Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2] according to desired conditions for individual experimental set-up.",
    "Aspirate the media from the 12-well plate, making sure not to disturb the seeded cells. Wash the seeded cells with 1 mL 1% FBS/DMEM/PS media (warmed to 37°C).\nImmediately prior to treating seeded cells, aspirate the remaining media and add 800 μL of the LPS or dPBS treatment(s) prepared in media (based on Table 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl2]).\nNote: An example LPS treatment (dose and length of time) strategy is outlined in Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5].\nIncubate treated cells at 37°C for the desired length of time (suggested: 6, 12 and/or 24 h, see Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2243-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. LPS treatment and timing strategy example for a single 12-well plate\nIn this example, 800 μL of solution should be added to each well. This strategy can be revised according to the desired conditions for an individual investigator’s experimental set-up.\nPhagocytosis assay in microglia\nTiming: 30 min hands-on, 2 h 30 min total\nNote: Before performing the phagocytosis assay, microglia seeded in a 12-well plate can be treated with LPS at the dosage and for the length of time (6, 12, and/or 24 h) of interest. An alternate form of microglia activation can be used such as IFNγ+TNFα.9[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9] These pro-inflammatory stimulants result in microglia transitioning from basal state in which microglia surveil the environment to an activated pro-inflammatory state. This activated state will result in increased phagocytotic activity in microglia. If LPS stimulation fails to activate microglia, refer to troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 5.\nPrepare 10 μL per well of bead treatment solution by mixing latex bead stock in a 1:10 ratio with 1% FBS/DMEM/PS.\nFor example, for 12 wells, prepare 120 μL by adding 12 μL latex bead stock to 108 μL 1% FBS/DMEM/PS.\nThis prepared volume accounts for extra treatment solution as only 8 μL of the solution well be added per well.",
    "Add 8 μL of bead mixture directly to treatment media already in wells, tilting plate to distribute evenly within the well.\nNote: For appropriate treatment controls, incubate one well with 1% FBS/DMEM/PS prepared without fluorescent beads.\nIncubate plates at 37°C for 2 h then aspirate beads and media without disturbing cells/cover glass.\nRinse wells with 1 mL 1× dPBS. Aspirate and repeat for two total washes with 1× dPBS.\nAspirate 1× dPBS from wells and add 1 mL 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (prepare 4% PFA as described above in materials and equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]).\nIncubate wells with 4% PFA for 10 min at 37°C to fix cells.\nWash wells twice with 1 mL 1× dPBS.\nAspirate 1× dPBS from wells and add 1 mL 1× dPBS to each well for storage.\nProtect plates from light by wrapping plates in aluminum foil and store at 4°C.\nPlates can be stored at 4°C for up to 1 month before visualization and analysis.\nFluorescent bead treatment to microglia for phagocytosis\nTiming: Day 1 – 30 min hands-on, 2 h total (Step 50 - 55)\nTiming: Day 2 – 45 min hands-on, 3 h 30 min total (Steps 56–65)\nAspirate 1× dPBS storage solution from wells without disturbing cells and the coveslip.\nIncubate coverslips with blocking solution for 1 h 30 min at 18°C–26°C, covered to protect from light.\nWhile incubating, prepare 70 μL of 1° ab solution per coverslip by adding Anti-Iba1, Rabbit (RB, 0.5 mg/mL, RRID: AB_839504) to blocking solution at a 1:500 ratio (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2243-Fig6.jpg\nFigure 6.

    "(C) Visualization of WT microglia phagocytosis of fluorescent beads after staining. Images are labeled with beads (red), microglia (Iba1, cyan), and nuclei (DAPI, blue). Higher magnifications of the left images (yellow box) are shown on the right panel. Scale bars for left image and right image represent 30 μm and 10 μm, respectively. Cells were imaged at 20× magnification and analyzed using Fiji – ImageJ software. Microglia images are adopted from a previous publication by Parrott et al. (2021).1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nFor example, for 12 wells, prepare 840 μL by adding 1.68 μL Anti-Iba1, Rabbit to 840 μL of blocking solution.\nThis prepared volume accounts for extra 1° ab solution as only 60 μL of the solution will be added per coverslip.\nThis 1° ab solution needs to be placed onto parafilm stretched over a 12-well plate in 60 μL “bubbles” for each coverslip.\nNote: Iba1 is a microglia- and macrophage-specific protein marker commonly used when immunostaining microglia. However, Iba1 alone does not confirm the present of microglia and exclude a potential macrophage contamination. Therefore, other antibodies can be used in addition to anti-Iba1 to confirm microglia and should be selected based on the investigator’s need.\nAntibody for P2RY12, a receptor downregulated during inflammatory response, is specific to identify non-activated microglia10[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10] although due to the LPS-induced activation of microglia suggested in this protocol, P2RY12 might not be an ideal target for identifying activated microglia without an additional primary antibody. Anti-transmembrane protein 119 (TMEM119) antibody is commonly used to distinguish microglia from peripheral macrophages, which would provide information on a potential macrophage contamination.11[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]\nEach coverslip needs to be removed from its well using forceps and placed cell-side down into “bubble” on the parafilm. Carefully place the lid of the 12-well plate over the coverslips.",
    "With forceps, carefully pick up the coverslips and place each cell-side down into the “bubble” on the parafilm. Cover with 12-well plate lid.\nIncubate in the 1° ab solution for 8–18 h at 4°C, covered to protect from light.\nNote: To differentiate background signal from the specific Anti-Iba1 signal, a negative control can be used. Prepare the negative control by adding Rabbit IgG Isotype control (5 mg/mL, RRID: AB_2532938) to blocking solution at a 1:5000 ratio then incubate the desired coverslips with the same method as described in steps 52–55.\nReturn coverslips to the wells of a 12-well plate.\nAdd 1 mL 1× PBS to wells to wash coverslips. Incubate for 5 min, covered, on a rocker. Aspirate 1× PBS and repeat for a total of 3 washes.\nWhile washing, prepare 70 μL of 2° ab solution per coverslip/well by adding Cy™5 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (1.5 mg/mL, RRID: AB_2340607) to blocking solution at a 1:500 ratio.\nFor example, for 12 wells, prepare 840 μL by adding 1.68 μL Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) to 840 μL of blocking solution.\nThis prepared volume accounts for extra 2° ab solution as only 60 μL of the solution well be added per well.\nAs with the blocking and 1° ab solution, the 2° ab solution needs to be placed onto parafilm stretched over a 12-well plate in 60 μL “bubbles” for each coverslip.\nWith forceps, carefully pick up the coverslips and place each cell-side down into the “bubble” on the parafilm. Cover with 12-well plate lid.\nIncubate in the 2° ab solution for 1 h 30 min at 18°C–26°C, covered to protect from light.",
    "Return coverslips to the wells of a 12-well plate. Wash coverslips with 1 mL 1× PBS per well and incubate for 5 min. Repeat for a total 3 washes.\nUsing forceps, remove each coverslip from the wells and mount on microscope slides with 1–2 drops of Invitrogen™ ProLong™ Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (DAPI visualizes nuclear DNA. DAPI staining is used as a nuclei marker that can identify cells).\nMount 2–3 coverslips on each slide.\nAllow slides to dry at 18°C–26°C for 1–2 h, covered.\nCoat the edges of each coverslip on the slide with a thin layer of clear nail polish. This seals the cover glass to the slides.\nAllow nail polish to dry at 18°C–26°C for 8–18 h, covered. Store slides at 4°C for long term storage.\nNote: Samples can be visualized on a Zeiss Confocal microscope or Zeiss fluorescence microscope with Apotome using Zeiss ZEN software (Figures 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]B and 6C). Image analysis and phagocytosis quantification can be completed using Fiji - ImageJ software. See imaging and quantification below for additional information.\nNote: While fluorescent imaging is used in this protocol, an additional method for bead quantification in cells is flow cytometry, which provides the benefit of rapid analysis with a higher throughput. Our protocol uses immunostaining, fluorescent imaging, and manual counting to analyze the number of phagocytosed beads per cell and visualize the morphology of microglia.\nImaging and quantification of phagocytosed fluorescent beads in microglia\nTiming: 2 h hands-on, 2 h total (depending on the sample size, it can be shorter or longer)\nImage microglia and beads using microscope; a Zeiss Confocal microscope or a Zeiss fluorescence microscope with Apotome and a 20× lens.\nPrepare for imaging by determining an exposure time for each channel to be used; DAPI, fluorescent beads, and microglia.",
    "Note: This exposure time needs to remain constant between imaging different slides in the experiment.\nDetermine the Z-stack number and Z-stack interval that will be used for imaging.\nNote: Since microglia are typically about 10–15 μm thick and the diameter of the beads have a 0.5 μm mean particle size, we recommend the Z-stack interval to be between 0.5–1 μm to easily differentiate between beads. We recommend 10–15 Z-stacks depending on the chosen interval.\nTo begin imaging, find an area of the coverslip that includes multiple cells. Set up the first Z-position and last Z-position by focusing up and down using imaging software. Collect 2–3 Z-stack images per coverslip.\nNote: Once image parameters have been optimized, all cells need to be imaged using the optimized exposure time, Z-stack size and Z-stack interval so that cells in the same experiment can be compared.\nNote: For each genotype, treatment, and treatment length, 2–3 coverslips are plated, treated, assayed and immunostained for analysis. Following immunostaining, each coverslip is imaged and 2–3 images are collected for quantification per coverslip.\nFollowing imaging, count beads per microglia using Fiji - ImageJ software.\nWithin each image, assess every microglia (Iba1/DAPI positive) for co-localization of beads (i.e., 0+ beads) by viewing the images in each Z-stack.\nThe Z-stack images provide information on bead size and shape so that individual beads can be identified within range of the microglia marker.\nAll beads per microglia values are averaged for each treatment and treatment length then statistically compared between each genotype.\nNote: If latex beads do not fluoresce, please see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 3, and if immunostaining appears to be nonspecific, please see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 4. Following analysis, if treatment does not increase phagocytosis, please see troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] problem 5."
