    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nInduction of nTE\nTiming: 2–3 days\nPrepare Laminin-E8-coated wells beforehand.\nDilute 1.5 μg (3 μL) of Laminin-E8 (iMatrix-511) in 1 mL/well of PBS and pipette the solution into one well of a newly prepared 6-well plate.\nIncubate at 37°C for at least 30 min.\nNote: The Laminin-E8 concentration is critical and is 0.15 μg/cm2 (0.3 μL/cm2). Instead of pre-coating, Laminin-E8 can be added to the medium and pipetted up and down several times after the naive PSCs are seeded in Step 5.\nNote: MEF feeder cells are not used for the nTE induction.\nDissociation of naive PSCs.\nAspirate the medium from the wells and rinse with PBS two times.\nAdd 500 μL Accutase and incubate at 37°C for 10–15 min.\nAdd 1 mL of Wash medium and gently pipette up and down to dislodge the naive PSCs from the well.\nTransfer the cells to a 15-mL tube and add 5 mL of Wash medium.\nCentrifuge at 1,300 rpm for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 1 mL of t2iLGö medium with Y-27632.\nPrepare a 6-well plate and add 1 mL of 0.1% gelatin solution to a well.\nAspirate the gelatin solution after 10 min of incubation at room temperature and incubate the cell suspension in 1 mL t2iLGö medium with 10 μM Y-27632 on the gelatin-coated well.\nIncubate at 37°C for 2 h to make the MEF feeder cells attach to the well.\nCollect the medium with floating PSCs into a 15-mL tube and count the number of cells.",
    "Critical: The quality of naive PSCs is critical. Naive PSCs show a dome-shaped morphology and express characteristic transcriptional genes such as OCT3/4, NANOG, KLF4, and KLF17. In addition, naive PSCs show specific cell surface markers such as CD75 and SUSD2. Sometimes differentiated cells can be observed as flat shaped cells. Such differentiated cells may reduce the efficiency of the subsequent nTE and nCT differentiation.\nCentrifuge at 1,300 rpm for 3 min and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend with 2 mL of nTE-1 medium.\nSeed the cells at a density of 2 × 104–4 × 104 cells/cm2 on Laminin-E8-coated dishes.\nThe following day, change the medium to nTE-2 medium.\nChange the medium again the next day.\nOn day 3, obtain TACSTD2+ENPEP+ nTE (we obtained an efficiency of 50–60%; Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1135-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Gating strategy\nFlow cytometric gating strategy to sort viable TACSTD2+ENPEP+ cells from differentiated human naive pluripotent stem cells.\nOptional: nTE can be induced without 10 ng/mL recombinant human BMP4 for the first 24 hours of the induction, although at a lower efficiency.\nCritical: The step of depriving MEF is critical. The residual MEF inhibits the differentiation of naive PSCs to nTE.\nNote: A higher concentration of Laminin-E8 reduces the induction efficiency of nTE. A concentration of 0.10–0.25 μg/cm2 Laminin-E8 is recommended.\nNote: hPSCs should be cultured with 10 μM Y-27632 for 24 h upon/after seeding.\nNote: Confirm that cell morphology on day 2 or 3 is polygonal and flat under the microscope (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nNote: nTE strongly attaches to the dish and takes 20–30 minutes to dissociate using Accutase.\nNote: RNA sequencing confirmed that naive PSC-derived TACSTD2+ENPEP- cells on day 2 and naive PSC-derived TACSTD2+ENPEP+ cells on day 3 have a high correlation with pre-implantation trophectoderm in vivo.\nInduction of nCTs",
    "Timing: 4 h; 3–6 days until next splitting\nnTE differentiates into nCT under ACE condition (Io et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPrepare Laminin-E8-coated wells beforehand.\nAdd 1.5 μg (3 μL) of Laminin-E8 to 1 mL of PBS and pipette up and down several times.\nAdd Laminin-E8/PBS solution to one well of 6-well plates.\nIncubate at 37°C for at least 30 min.\nDissociation of nTE from step 8.\nAspirate the medium from the wells and rinse with PBS two times.\nAdd 500 μL Accutase and incubate at 37°C for 20–30 min.\nAdd 1 mL of Wash medium and gently pipette up and down to dislodge the cells from the well.\nTransfer the cells to a 15-mL tube and add 5 mL of Wash medium.\nCentrifuge at 1,300 rpm for 3 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet with 2 mL HBSS with 1% BSA buffer (1% BSA/HBSS) and Y-27632.\nIncubate at 4°C for at least 30 min.\nCentrifuge at 1,300 rpm for 3 min, aspirate the supernatant, and resuspend the pellet with 1% BSA/HBSS with anti-TACSTD2, biotin-conjugated antibody, and anti-ENPEP, PE-conjugated antibody.\nIncubate at 4°C for 30 min in the dark.\nResuspend with 1 mL of 1% BSA/HBSS.\nCentrifuge at 1,300 rpm for 3 min and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend with 1% BSA/HBSS with anti-Streptavidin, APC-conjugated antibody.\nIncubate at 4°C for 30 min.\nResuspend with 1 mL of 1% BSA/HBSS.\nCentrifuge at 1,300 rpm for 3 min and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend with 300–500 μL of 1% BSA/HBSS.\nSort the TACSTD2+ENPEP+ cells (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: As with any cell sorting, make sure the cell sorter is clean before sorting so that contamination with other cells or microbials is avoided.\nNote: Keep the collection medium cool (4°C) during cell sorting to maintain the viability of the cells.",
    "Note: Cell sorting should be performed with a sufficiently rigorous selection to obtain a cell fraction of high purity (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nSeed the TACSTD2+ENPEP+ cells at a density of 2 × 104–4 × 104 cells/cm2 on Laminin-E8-coated dishes in ACE medium with 10 μM Y-27632 and 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin.\nReplace the ACE medium every two days.\nPassage the cells every 3–6 days by dissociation with Accutase for 10–15 min and seed them at a 1:3-1:4 split ratio. Add 10 μM Y-27632 for every passage.\nNote: Around 0.5–1 × 105 TACSTD2+ENPEP+ cells can be usually collected from 1 well of a 6-well plate by flow cytometry.\nNote: The combination of biotin-conjugated anti-TACSTD2 antibody and APC-conjugated anti-Streptavidin antibody demonstrate the sensitivity and resolution (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B and 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nNote: If you use fluorescent dye-conjugated antibodies as primary antibodies, you can omit the secondary antibody (anti-Streptavidin, APC-conjugated antibody).\nNote: If you use flow cytometry upon/after cytotrophoblast induction day 10–12, you can purify naive PSC-derived cytotrophoblasts (TACSTD2+ENPEP+SIGLEC6+cells) effectively.\nMaintenance of nCTs\nTiming: 4 h; 3–6 days until next splitting\nnCTs can be maintained in ACE medium for more than 40 passages as cytotrophoblast stem cells (Io et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPrepare Laminin-E8-coated wells beforehand.\nAdd 1.5 μg of Laminin-E8 to 1 mL of PBS and pipette up and down several times.\nAdd the Laminin-E8/PBS solution to one well of 6-well dishes.\nIncubate at 37°C for at least 30 min in 5% O2.\nDissociation of nCTs.\nAspirate the medium from the wells and rinse with PBS two times in 21% O2.\nAdd 500 μL Accutase and incubate at 37°C for 10–15 min in 5% O2.\nAdd 1 mL of Wash medium and gently pipette up and down to dislodge the cells from the well in 21% O2.",
    "Transfer the cells to a 15-mL tube and add 5 mL of Wash medium in 21% O2.\nCentrifuge at 1,300 rpm for 3 min in 21% O2.\nAdd ACE medium with Y-27632 for 24 h.\nSeed the cells at a density of 4 × 104 cells/cm2 on the Laminin-E8-coated wells in 21% O2 and incubate the cells in 5% O2, 5% CO2.\nReplace the medium every two days (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1135-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Add 10 μM Y-27632 for every passage.\nNote: nCTs should be cultured with Y-27632 for 24 h with every passage.\nPause point: Cells can be cryopreserved in Stem-Cellbanker and stored in liquid nitrogen.\nDifferentiation into naive PSC-derived syncytiotrophoblasts (nSTs)\nTiming: 6 days\nnCTs can differentiate to nSTs according to previous protocols (Okae et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Io et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPrepare Laminin-E8-coated wells beforehand.\nAdd 1.5 μg (3 μL) of Laminin-E8 to 1 mL of PBS and pipette up and down several times.\nAdd the Laminin-E8/PBS solution to one well of 6-well dishes.\nIncubate at 37°C for at least 30 min.\nDissociation of nCTs.\nAspirate the medium from the wells and rinse with PBS two times.\nAdd 500 μL Accutase and incubate at 37°C for 20–30 min.\nAdd 1 mL of Wash medium and gently pipette up and down to dislodge the cells from the well.\nTransfer the cells to a 15-mL tube and add 5 mL of Wash medium.\nCentrifuge at 1,300 rpm for 3 min.",
    "Resuspend with ST medium.\nSeed the cells at a density of 1 × 104 cells/cm2 on the Laminin-E8-coated wells.\nReplace the medium at day 3.\nObserve the nSTs on day 6 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: The cells are incubated in 21% O2, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator at 37°C during the induction.\nNote: Since ST medium contains Y-27632, no additional Y-27632 is needed at seeding.\nDifferentiation into naive cell-derived extravillous trophoblasts (nEVTs)\nTiming: 8 days\nnCTs can differentiate to nEVTs according to previous protocols (Okae et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Io et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nPrepare Laminin-E8-coated wells beforehand.\nAdd 1.5 μg (3 μL) of Laminin-E8 to 1 mL of PBS and pipette up and down several times.\nAdd the Laminin-E8/PBS solution to one well of 6-well dishes.\nIncubate at 37°C for at least 30 min.\nDissociation of nCTs.\nAspirate the medium from the wells and rinse with PBS two times.\nAdd 500 μL Accutase and incubate at 37°C for 20–30 min.\nAdd 1 mL of Wash medium and gently pipette up and down to dislodge the cells from the well.\nTransfer the cells to a 15-mL tube and add 5 mL of Wash medium.\nCentrifuge at 1,300 rpm for 3 min.\nResuspend with EVT-1 medium.\nSeed the cells at a density of 0.8 × 104 cells/cm2 on the Laminin-E8-coated wells.\nAdd 2% of Geltrex to the medium.\nReplace EVT-1 medium with EVT-2 medium on day 3 and add 0.5% of Geltrex to the medium.\nDissociate the cells into single cells with Accutase for 10–15 min on day 6 and then resuspend with EVT-3 medium.\nSeed the cells on new Laminin-E8-coated wells at a 1:2–1:3 split ratio.\nAdd 0.5% of Geltrex to the medium.\nAnalyze the cells on day 8 (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]C).",
    "Note: The cells are incubated in 21% O2, 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator at 37°C during induction.\nNote: Since EVT medium contains Y-27632, no additional Y-27632 is needed at seeding.\nOptional: You may switch to EVT-3 medium without re-plating on day 6.\nIsolation of human cytotrophoblasts\nTiming: 6 h; 3–6 days until next splitting\nThis protocol describes the use of primary patient material. Please confirm that you are allowed to process primary patient material with your local Ethics Committee and request informed consent from the donors. Placental tissues should be kept under sterile conditions.\nPrepare Laminin-E8-coated wells beforehand.\nAdd 1.5 μg (3 μL) of Laminin-E8 to 1 mL of PBS and pipette up and down several times.\nAdd the Laminin-E8/PBS solution to one well of 6-well dishes.\nIncubate at 37°C for at least 30 min.\nHuman chorionic villi are manually separated from the chorionic membrane and decidua.\nCut the chorionic villi into small pieces and transfer to a 50-mL tube.\nRinse the villous fragments with 40 mL of sterile PBS.\nCentrifuge at 800 rpm (120 g) for 2 min.\nAspirate most of the supernatant.\nRepeat the rinse procedure.
