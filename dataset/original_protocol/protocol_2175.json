    "Step-by-Step Method Details\nStep-by-Step Method Details\nSample Preparation: Day 1\nTiming: 1–2 h\nFollowing the collection of the samples, they need to be processed for analysis by BN-PAGE and immunoblotting or in gel activity assays. Sample processing includes the extraction in native conditions of the protein complexes embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane and their preparation to be loaded onto a BN-PAGE gel.\nThaw frozen aliquots or use freshly prepared samples.\nRe-isolate mitochondria by pelleting them by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. Whole-cell lysate pellets can be used directly.\nResuspend the mitochondrial or whole-cell lysate pellets in aminocaproic acid buffer containing protease inhibitors (freshly added). Measure protein concentration at this stage, using the BCA Protein Assay kit (Sigma-Aldrich). Use 200–400 μg protein/sample in a total volume of 50–60 μL for yeast samples or 100 μL for human cells.\nCritical: Quantify protein concentration before adding the detergent. This will lead to reproducible results (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: Digitonin-treated whole-cell lysate pellets are difficult to homogenize by pipetting. Use a pellet mixer for 3–4 s on ice to completely resuspend the pellet. If necessary, repeat until the suspension is homogeneous.\nAdd the optimal amount of detergent to the sample and incubate for 10 min on ice.\nNote: For the detection of individual subcomplexes (assembly intermediates) or complexes, use dodecyl maltoside (DDM). For the detection of supercomplexes, use high purity digitonin or lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol (LMNG). LMNG has been extensively used to determine the structural properties of mitochondrial membrane proteins by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) (Parey et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib17]; Tucker and Park, 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib24]), because it enhances the solubilization and stabilization of integral membrane proteins (Chae et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]), facilitating crystal formation and data analysis.",
    "Note: In the case of Saccharomyces cerevisiae respiratory complexes, individual complexes are detected upon extraction with DDM or LMNG. Otherwise, supercomplex association is preserved in the presence of digitonin or glycol-diosgenin (GDN). Both detergents have been used for yeast supercomplex structural determination by cryo-EM (Hartley et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Rathore et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib19]).\nCritical: The amount of detergent depends on the enzymatic complex and the cell line to be analyzed. It is recommended to start by performing a titration of the protein/detergent ratio to optimize the protocol before the analysis of a new cell line or when using a different supplier for the detergents (as in Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2C). The amount and type of detergent need to be consistent in each replicate to be able to compare and quantify the results (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: For human HEK293T cell lines, a protein/detergent ratio between 1:1–2 of DDM (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B) or 1:2–4 of high-purity digitonin (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A–2C and (Lobo-Jarne et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Timón-Gómez et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib23])), and 1:1–3 of LMNG is recommended (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A). In Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria, a protein/detergent ratio of 1:1–3 for DDM or digitonin is suggested (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B).\nAfter the incubation with the detergent, clarify the extracts by centrifuging the samples at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C. Discard the pellet and carefully transfer the supernatant to a new microcentrifuge tube.\nNote: If a benchtop ultracentrifuge is available, the centrifugation after incubation with the detergent can be done at 35,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C in an ultracentrifuge.\nAdd 10 μL of Native loading buffer 10× to human samples. In yeast samples, add 5 μL of 50% glycerol and 2 μL of Native loading buffer 10×. Samples are ready to be loaded on to the gel.",
    "Load between 5–40 μL of the sample, depending on the type of analysis. Use an amount of 40–160 μg of protein for yeast samples, and 70–100 μg of protein to analyze human samples. A larger amount could be necessary for certain types of analysis, but it is necessary to take into account that excessive protein load leads to poorer resolution of high molecular weight complexes (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: As a protein loading control, these samples can be separated in SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies against TOM20 or ACTIN in human (Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 2B) or Porin in yeast. Add 1% of SDS to the native samples before loading them in SDS-PAGE gels.\nNote: Samples extracted with DDM (or the remaining solution after loading the gel) can be stored at −80°C for up to 1 month for future use.\nCritical: Samples extracted with digitonin may undergo supercomplex disintegration and loss of in gel enzyme activities, and the BN-PAGE analysis of frozen samples may lose resolution. Thus, it is recommended to use the digitonin-treated samples freshly. Samples extracted with DDM, which does not preserve supercomplex integrity, are not affected by this step.\nElectrophoresis: Day 1\nTiming: 21 h\nMitochondrial respiratory chain complexes can be extracted as individual entities or as macromolecular associations (supercomplexes) and separated in acrylamide gradient gels for further analysis.\nUse pre-cast gels from Invitrogen. Different gradients are used according to the type of analysis:\n4%–16% Bis-Tris Gels, to visualize individual complexes and assembly intermediates after DDM extraction.\n3%–12% Bis-Tris Gels after digitonin or LMNG extraction, to analyze individual complexes and supercomplexes.\nNote: Gels are available with 10 or 15 wells. 10-well gels facilitate the loading and visualization of the mitochondrial respiratory complexes.",
    "Optional: Acrylamide gradient gels can be prepared as reported (Diaz et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]), adjusting the percentages of acrylamide optimal for the different analyses.\nFill the electrophoresis chamber with the anode buffer at the bottom and with the dark blue cathode buffer at the upper chamber.\nBefore loading the samples, wash the wells (pipetting up and down with the cathode buffer) to remove traces of non-polymerized acrylamide.\nLoad between 10–40 μL of sample in each well and a molecular weight marker.\nNote: Commercial molecular weight markers are available depending on the size of the complexes we expect to analyze. Alternatively, use apoferritin prepared in the Native loading buffer 1×. Apoferritin, (molecular masses: monomer is 450 kDa; dimer is 900 kDa) is visible in the gel without staining, which provides a useful reference for the size of respiratory complexes and supercomplexes (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nRun the gel at a constant voltage of 30 V for 1 h at 15°C–25°C. Then, change the dark blue cathode buffer for the light blue cathode buffer and run for 20 h at 30 V at 4°C (as shown in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A), to avoid overheating. The change of the buffer will help in the analysis of the samples by immunoblotting or enzymatic activity, by decreasing the amount of Coomassie blue dye in the gel.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/177-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Illustration of Several Steps of a BN-PAGE Experiment and Analysis\n(A) Electrophoresis chamber running a 3%–12% BisTris gel at 4°C, after the removal of the dark blue cathode buffer and replacement with the light blue cathode buffer.\n(B) Materials and equipment necessary for the assembling of the transfer sandwich for electroblotting.\n(C) BN-PAGE gels used for in gel activity analysis of complex I (left), or complex IV (right), mounted in an acrylamide gel drying system.",
    "Note: When analyzing DDM-extracted respiratory complexes, the electrophoretic voltage can be increased to 45 V for 20 h or to 70 V for 4–5 h.\nNote: There is not a pause point after running the gel if BN-PAGE is combined with in gel activity assays or immunoblotting (see below). Only if it is combined with a second dimension SDS-PAGE (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] and Limitations[href=https://www.wicell.org#limitations] sections), the cut gel strips from the first dimension (BN-PAGE) can be frozen at −20°C and stored for up to 2 weeks before running the second dimension (SDS-PAGE).\nCritical: It is highly recommended to run the samples until the Coomassie blue dye front runs out of the gel completely. In order to visualize small subcomplexes and the accumulation of unbound monomeric subunits, it is recommended to use a different gradient (e.g., 4%–16%), rather than running the gel for a shorter time (destaining process will be longer). It is easier to compare bands between different samples when the running time is constant. Twenty hours of electrophoresis allows for the separation of the bands corresponding to higher-order supercomplexes (CI+CIII2+CIVn). Do not leave the electrophoresis longer than 24 h to avoid compromising supercomplex stability.\nNote: When using a large amount of protein (140–180 μg, depending on the cell line), it is possible to directly visualize MRC complexes and supercomplexes as Coomassie G250-stained bands migrating in the gel (as detected in Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Alternatively, the gel can also be used for regular post-run staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/177-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(C) CI (using iodonitrotetrazolium) and CIV in gel activity assays of purified HEK293T mitochondria extracted with increasing concentrations of digitonin.\nAnalysis of Mitochondrial Respiratory Complexes and Supercomplexes: Day 2\nTiming: 4–24 h\nThis method allows alternatively assessing the steady-state levels and general pattern of mitochondrial respiratory complexes and suplecomplexes by Coomassie staining, their composition by immunoblotting with specific antibodies, and their activity using in gel activity stain assays.\nNote: In some instances, it can be convenient to load duplicate samples in the same gel. This can, for example, allow analyzing simultaneously: (i) the activity and the composition of the respiratory complexes, (ii) the distribution of two specific proteins of different complexes which could have a similar molecular weight or be present in the same supercomplex (e.g., supercomplex I+III2 could be detected with CI and CIII antibodies).\nNote: Steps 13–16 describe Analysis by Coomassie staining\nIncubate the gel in a tray containing the Coomassie staining solution and shake it gently for 30 min at 15°C–25°C.\nOptional: Any commercial Coomassie staining solution should work as well.\nRemove the staining solution and replace it with Coomassie destaining solution.\nNote: Coomassie staining solution can be reused multiple times and stored at 15°C–25°C. Keep the bottle sealed to prevent solvent evaporation.\nChange the destaining solution periodically with fresh solution, as it becomes blue from the dye or every 20 min until the background of the gel is transparent, and bands corresponding to MRC complexes and supercomplexes are visible. It takes 2 to 24 h.\nTake a picture or scan the gel using a plastic wrap and, for example, an HP ENVY 5660 scanner.\nNote: Steps 17–26 describe analysis by immunoblotting\nWhen using the eBlot L1 Blotting System, immerse the gel in distilled H2O for 1 min.",
    "Transfer proteins to a membrane using the eBlot L1 Blotting System (GenScript). This is a wet protein transfer system that uses isopropanol instead of methanol.\nNote: The use of this system allows attaining a faster and efficient transfer of high molecular bands corresponding to mitochondrial supercomplexes (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nUse nitrocellulose (NT) or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes.\nNote: PVDF has a higher sensitivity and protein binding capacity (170 to 200 μg/cm) than nitrocellulose. Nitrocellulose membranes, on the other hand, are more resistant and allow more antibodies to be tested sequentially with a minimal background.\nImmerse the membranes in the equilibration buffer, provided with the system (in the case of PVDF membranes, soak them first in methanol, and then in the buffer). It is essential to keep the membrane in the buffer until it is completely wet, to obtain optimal results.\nPrepare the transfer sandwich with dry sponges, membrane, and gel (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nStart the program (Refer to Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for program details).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_177_15.csv\nOptional: Use any wet transfer system. Soak the membrane, when needed, in methanol and, then, in the transfer buffer before assembling the sandwich (usually, it also contains filter paper). Transfer at a constant 30 V for 20 h at 4°C.\nCritical: Do not reuse the transfer buffer and/or equilibration buffer more than five times. The recommended shelf-life of the transfer buffer is 3 weeks at 4°C.\nAir-dry the membrane completely for 1–2 h.\nPause Point: Once dried, the membrane can be kept for weeks before its reconstitution with methanol.\nRemove the dye out of the membrane at 15°C–25°C:",
    "In the case of PVDF membranes, the membrane needs to be completely dry to be destained. Perform a quick immersion in methanol, but do not leave the membrane for more than 5–10 s. Then, transfer the membrane immediately to the Coomassie blue dye washing buffer and incubate for 15 min. Discard the solution and incubate again for 15 min with the same solution. This step helps to expose the epitopes of the proteins that will be recognized by the antibody.\nNitrocellulose membranes require longer destaining steps than PVDF. Incubate in abundant Coomassie blue dye washing buffer for 1–3 h, replacing the buffer every 15–30 min. Then, wash three times for 10 min in Rinse solution 3.\nCritical: To prevent loss of the signal, do not leave the PVDF membrane in the Coomassie blue dye washing buffer for more than 30 min in total.\nBlock the membrane with 5% non-fat dry milk in Rinse solution for at least 1–3 h at 15°C–25°C (usually for 16–20 h at 4°C for nitrocellulose membranes).\nPerform a standard immunoblot protocol, using antibodies specific for mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes (see Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting]).\nNote: Chemiluminescent detection of high-order supercomplexes can be improved using SuperSignal™ West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Thermo). Combine 50 μL of solution A and solution B with 1 mL of each regular chemiluminescent solution, per membrane.",
    "Optional: To determine sub-complex, complex, and supercomplex subunit composition, a two-dimensional (2D) BN/SDS gel electrophoresis can be performed. As the first dimension BN-PAGE separates intact OXPHOS complexes, subsequent denaturing electrophoresis in the presence of the anionic detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) resolves the individual subunits of the respective complexes and supercomplexes. In combination with immunoblotting, it offers the advantage that the signals are usually much stronger and that all proteins can be detected due to increased epitope availability (Calvaruso et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Nijtmans et al., 2002[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). To perform a 2D-BN/SDS-PAGE analysis, following the first BN-PAGE dimension, a lane corresponding to a cell line or mitochondrial sample, is cut out of the gel with a razorblade and placed on a small plastic container for further processing. The gel strip can also be wrapped in plastic and frozen at −80°C for up to 2 weeks, until further use. The strip is then incubated with a denaturing solution (1% SDS and 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol) for 15 min at 20°C–25°C. The denaturing solution is removed and the strip is incubated with 1% SDS for additional 15 min at 20°C–25°C. Solution is removed as completely as possible (excess of solution is drained away using a filter paper). The gel strip is placed at the top of a glass plate and the glass sandwich to cast the SDS gel is further assembled. The first dimension gel should be thicker than the second dimension gel (1.5 mm versus 0.75 mm), to allow the gel strip to be squeezed between at the top of the glass plates. Then, a 10%–12% separation polyacrylamide separation gel is added until 5 mm below the gel strip and is overlay with water or isopropanol to create a smooth horizontal interface.",
    "When the gel is polymerized, the water/isopropanol is removed and a 4% stacking gel is added, covering the gel strip. After polymerization, electrophoresis is started at 30 V for 30 min and then continued at 80–100 V for 2–4 h until the blue dye front reaches the end of the gel. Standard immunoblotting protocols for SDS gels can then be applied.",
    "Note: Steps 27 and 28 describe analysis by in gel activity stain assays\nAfter electrophoretic separation, immerse the gel directly in the desired enzymatic activity solution (Refer to Materials and Equipment[href=https://www.wicell.org#materials-and-equipment]). The amount of time depends on the sample and the complex activity analyzed (from 30 min for CI and CII activities to 12–24 h for CIV activity).\nCritical: All enzymatic activity solutions must be prepared freshly.\nNote: For complex IV activity, it is recommended to incubate the gel immersed into the solution at 37°C to increase the efficiency of the enzymatic reaction. Allow between 12–48 h for optimal visualization of complex IV activity within the supercomplexes of human cultured cells, replacing CIV activity solution with newly made one every 12–24 h.\nWrap the stained gels in plastic and capture the signals using a scanner (use a minimum resolution of 300 dpi in, for example, an HP ENVY 5660 scanner).\nOptional: Dry the stained gels to get a sharper image. Soak the gel in the Gel Drying Solution (Bio-Rad) and place it between cellophane sheets, using an acrylamide drying system to assemble it (as in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C). Be careful to completely remove any air bubble to avoid the crack of the gel."
