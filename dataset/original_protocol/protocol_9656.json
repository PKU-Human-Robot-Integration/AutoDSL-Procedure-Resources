    "The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Utah approved all experimental protocols described here. Prior to the experiment, a total of 12 castrated male or non-pregnant female Yorkshire swine weighing 50-75 kg and between 6-8 months old were acclimated in their enclosures for at least 7 days. During this period, all care is directed by a veterinarian and in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Animal Welfare Act Regulations and Standards. The animals are fasted overnight prior to induction of anesthesia but are allowed free access to water.\n1. Sensor assembly\nCut a 6 cm piece of 3/8 in thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) tubing, 25 mm pieces of 1/8 in and 3/16 in PVC tubing, and 31 mm pieces of 1/8 in and 3/16 in PVC tubing.\nDrill a hole in the top of the non-vented cap to fit the exposed tip of the temperature probe; start with a 3/32 in drill bit, then use a 1/8 in drill bit.\nUse a 5/32 in drill bit to drill out the top part of the T-connector to fit the oxygen sensor.\nSlide the shorter piece of the 1/8 in PVC tubing over the inlet side of the flow sensor. Slide the longer 1/8 in piece of PVC tubing over the outlet side (as designated by the arrow on the flow sensor itself) of the flow sensor. Slide the shorter and longer 3/16 in pieces of PVC tubing over the corresponding lengths of the 1/8 in PVC tubing. Insert the barbed end of the male luer lock connector into the open end of the 1/8 in PVC tubing.",
    "NOTE: If necessary, use a heat gun to heat the tubing prior to sliding over barbed fittings. It is also possible to use isopropyl alcohol to lubricate the barbed end to make it easier to slide the tubing over the barbed connector.\nMix the biocompatible glue.\nExpose the tip of the temperature probe by removing any protective sheathing or tubing. Fill the inside of the tubing of the thermistor with biocompatible glue but do not cover the exposed tip.\nAssemble the parts as shown in Figure 1. Use the glue to secure each luer lock connection, when inserting the thermistor in the non-vented cap, and prior to sliding the 3/8 in TPE tubing over the barbed end.\nPrior to sterilization, ensure the blue cap on the oxygen stick is not twisted too tightly, or it will be difficult to undo after sterilization.\n\tNOTE: An image of an assembled device is shown in Figure 1 for reference. For this experiment, the fiber optic cable was connected to an electro-optical module that contains software that is designed to work with the specific oxygen sensors used in the device. Any luminescence quenching-based oxygen sensor and compatible data collection device will work. In addition, a custom module and a printed circuit board were designed to connect the flow sensor and temperature probe. Custom software was used to collect and display data in real-time.\n2. Experimental procedure\nInduction of anesthesia and monitoring.\n\t\nSedate the animal with a combined intramuscular injection of Ketamine (2.2 mg/kg) and Xylazine (2.2 mg/kg)  and Telazol (4.4 mg/kg).\nDepending on the size of the animal, place an appropriately sized (most likely between 7 mm and 8 mm) cuffed endotracheal tube with the assistance of a laryngoscope.\nApply eye lubricant to both eyes.",
    "Following induction, mechanically ventilate the animal with the maintenance of anesthesia with 1.5%-3.0% gaseous isoflurane mixed in oxygen. Set the fraction of inspired oxygen between 40%-100%, the positive end-expiratory pressure to 4 cm H2O, the tidal volume to 6-8 mL/kg, and adjust the respiratory rate and tidal volume to maintain end-tidal CO2 of 35-45 mmHg.\nMonitor and confirm the proper depth of anesthesia by assessing jaw tone, palpebral reflex approximately every 15 min, and absence of spontaneous movement throughout the experiment. Additionally, monitor clinical parameters of tissue perfusion (mucous membrane color, capillary refill time, heart rate), pulse oximetry, end-tidal CO2, core body temperature, and electrocardiogram.\nPosition the animal in dorsal recumbency on a warming blanket and secure each leg to the table.\nThe protocol is a non-survival procedure with euthanasia of the animal at the end of the experiment, as described in section 5.\nPrepare the animal for the experiment.\n\t\nPrepare all puncture sites (which are listed in steps 2.2.3-2.2.7) by scrubbing the skin with three alternating scrubs of chlorhexidine followed by alcohol. After the third scrub, apply chlorhexidine and allow to dry completely, then drape the surgical site in a sterile fashion.\nLocally infiltrate all puncture and incision sites with 2% lidocaine for local pain relief.\nUsing ultrasound guidance and the Seldinger technique, place a 9 Fr catheter in the right external jugular vein for medication infusion and central venous pressure monitoring and a 7 Fr catheter in the right femoral vein for resuscitation.\nUnder ultrasound guidance, place a 7 Fr sheath in the right brachial artery.\nUnder ultrasound guidance, place a 7 Fr sheath in the right femoral artery.\nUnder ultrasound guidance, place a 7 Fr sheath in the left femoral artery.\nUnder ultrasound guidance, place a 5 Fr sheath in the right or left carotid artery.",
    "Monitor the pressure distal to the balloon of the resuscitative endovascular occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) catheter via the left femoral artery sheath.\n\t\t\nConnect a disposable pressure transducer to the arterial catheter that is distal to the REBOA balloon.\nMonitor the pressure proximal to the balloon of the REBOA catheter via the carotid artery sheath.\n\t\t\nConnect a disposable pressure transducer to the arterial catheter that is proximal to the REBOA balloon.\nPerform a midline laparotomy by making an incision along the midline of the abdomen, starting at the inferior part of the sternum and ending at the pubis.\nWith the abdomen open, identify the bladder and perform a cystotomy, or make a small incision, to insert the tip of a 20 Fr urinary catheter in the bladder. Close the cystotomy with the urinary catheter in place using a purse string suture. After the catheter is in place, secure it to the skin with sutures.\nPrior to connecting the outlet of the catheter to the urinary collection bag, insert the cone-shaped end of the noninvasive PuO2 monitor into the outlet of the catheter.\nPlace the open tubing at the end of the novel PuO2 monitor over the cone-shaped connector on the tubing that is connected to the urine collection bag.\nRemove the spleen to eliminate hemorrhage-induced auto-transfusion.\n\t\t\nLocate the spleen. Identify the hilum of the spleen or the site where the splenic artery and vein enter the spleen. Clamp and transect each vessel.\nAfter transection, ligate each vessel using modified Miller knots using 2-0 sutures.\nPlace the instrument to measure bladder PuO2 and tissue oxygenation.\n\t\nMeasure PuO2 at the outlet of the bladder.",
    "Identify the balloon on the catheter. Just below the balloon make an incision along the long axis of the catheter, ensuring that you do not cut the lumen that connects to the balloon.\nAfter making the incision, insert a t-connector that contains the sensing material into the incision.\nUse tissue glue to secure the t-connector in place.\nConnect the fiber optic cable from the bladder data collection device to the connector that contains the sensing material.\nCreate a new file on the data collection device and note the time difference between the stand-alone collection device and other devices used in the experiment.\n\t\t\t\nFor the data collection device used in this study: push the back arrow to reach the main menu.\nGo to measurement settings and click on Ok. Use the arrows to highlight the measurement browser box and push Ok.\nPush the right arrow to create a new file. Type in the name of the new file and select Done.\nHighlight the new file name and select Ok. Navigate to the measurement screen and click on Ok to start recording.\nMeasure medullary renal tissue oxygenation.\n\t\t\nIdentify the location of the kidney internally.\nMove the bowel so that you have a clear line of site and access to the entire kidney. \nInsert the sensor into 2\" 18 gauge catheter. Adjust the luer lock connector on the sensor so that the tip of the sensor is exposed. Remove the catheter and place it over an 18 gauge needle.\nPlace the 18 gauge needle and 2 in catheter into the renal medulla under ultrasound guidance.\nRemove the needle, keeping the catheter in place. Thread the tissue sensor through the catheter and use the luer lock to connect the sensor to the catheter. \nUse tissue glue to secure the catheter in place.",
    "Connect the tissue sensor to the data collection box.\nWait for 10 min before beginning the experimental protocol after preparing the instrumentation and animal. This will be considered a baseline period.\nExperimental protocol\n\t\nPrior to starting the experimental procedure, ensure the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is ≥65 mmHg. If MAP is below the threshold, give up to two 5 mL/kg boluses of isotonic crystalloid solution. If MAP remains below 65 mmHg, infuse norepinephrine (0.02 µg/kg/min) until target MAP is achieved.\nInduce hemorrhagic shock.\n\t\t\nRemove 25% (estimated as 60 mL/kg) of the animal's estimated blood volume through the right brachial artery sheath over 30 min into gently agitated citrated blood collection bags. Mark the beginning of blood removal as t = 0 min.\nStore the removed blood in a warm water bath at 37 °C.\nThen perform randomization to assign animals to either the REBOA with whole blood or REBOA with crystalloids group (n = 6 for each group).\nPlace the REBOA catheter.\n\t\t\nInsert a 7 Fr REBOA catheter in the right femoral artery sheath. Place the balloon of the catheter immediately superior to the diaphragm and confirm the location using fluoroscopy.\nAt t = 30 min, inflate the REBOA balloon and completely occlude the aorta for 45 min.\nInitiate resuscitation and administer critical care.\n\t\t\nAt t = 70 min, transfuse each animal with their shed blood over 15 min.\nInfuse intravenous calcium over 10 min to prevent citrate-induced hypocalcemia.\nAt t = 75 min, deflate the REBOA balloon over 10 min.\nUntil t = 360 min, resuscitate the animal with fluids and norepinephrine to maintain a MAP > 65 mmHg.\nEnd of experiment and euthanasia\n\t\nCollect any remaining blood or urine samples.",
    "Euthanize the animal by injecting a combination of Pentobarbital Sodium (390 mg) and Phenytoin Sodium (50 mg) (1 mL/10 lbs).\n3. Data processing\nTime-sync all data files.\n\t\nBased on the times that were noted on each device relative to each other and the start of the experiment, align all data files such that t = 0 indicates the start of the experiment.\nRemove any data points associated with error flags from the flow sensor.\n\tNOTE: The error types are High Flow Rate and Air-in-Line. The High Flow Rate error indicates the flow rate exceeded the sensor's output limit. The Air-in-Line error flag is raised when the sensor detects air in the flow channel.\nDiscard the data associated with the negative flow.\n\t\nOnce flow becomes negative, track the volume that flows past the sensor in the backward direction.\nAfter the flow becomes positive, track the volume and compare it to the volume of negative flow to only include measurements from recently voided urine.\nSubscription Required.
