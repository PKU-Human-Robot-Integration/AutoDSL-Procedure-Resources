Flowchart of the experimental procedures, starting with acclimation of the rats to the vivarium through dual-task trainingRats are housed 2-3 per cage in a temperature and humidity-controlled animal vivarium and kept on a controlled light cycle (7:00 AM-7:00 PM). Rats are given ad libitum access to food (Prolab RMH 3000 rat chow pellets) and water during their acclimation to the colony room.After a 7-day acclimation period in the vivarium, rats are individually housed and brought to the laboratory daily for 5-7 days and handled for 15 min per day by experimenter. The experimenter handles the rat by placing a diaper over their lap and placing the animal on top of the diaper, allowing the animal to move freely. After handling, the experimenter places a plastic cup of chocolate sprinkles in the home cage. The rats are given 20 min to eat the sprinkles, and after 20 min the cup is removed. Rats are then put on food restriction (4-5 food pellets daily) to maintain them between 80 and 90% of their free-feeding body weight and given ad libitum access to water. Rats are food restricted starting at pre-training (i.e., the handling period) until the end of testing. Starting weight is recorded on the first day of handling and rats are weighed weekly for the duration of the experiment. Next, rats undergo goal box training. In this phase, rats are brought to the behavior room where the T-maze is located. The animals are confined to the goal arms on the maze and allowed to eat chocolate sprinkles from the reward cups for a total of 6 daily trials (3 per goal arm). A single trial has a duration of 90 sec with an ITI of 10 sec.",
    "The trial is terminated early if the animal consumes the food reward in less than 90 sec. Once rats consume the reward in less than 90 sec on every trial for two consecutive sessions, they progress to forced-run training. It typically takes 3 to 5 days for animals to reach goal box training performance criterion. Forced run sessions consist of 12 trials per day, with 6 left and 6 right trials given in a pseudorandom sequence. Prior to each trial, the experimenter places a removable wooden barrier at the entrance of one of the goal arms. At the start of the trial, the rat is confined to the start box with a second wooden removable barrier. The forced-run trial begins when the start box barrier is removed. The rat is encouraged to run from the start box, down the central arm, turn down the available goal arm, consume the reward, and return to the start box via the return arm. The rat is discouraged from turning around at any point on the maze by blocking his path with wooden stick. This path correction procedure is only necessary on early training sessions after which the experimenter interacts with the rat as minimally as possible. Once rats consume reward on 80% of forced run trials for 2 consecutive sessions, they progress to the single-task phase of training. Forced run training typically lasts for 6 to 7 days. Rats are trained on the CDWM task (Figure 5) or the CDSTANDARD task (Figure 6). The starting task variant is counterbalanced between rats, resulting in two groups; the CDWM group and the CDSTANDARD group. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170514/20170514202428_9499.jpgFigure 5.

See Video 2.<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 2. Example of three trials (1 wood followed by 2 mesh trials) of the CDSTANDARD task. Similar to Video 1, the experimenter flips the inserts between the wood and mesh trials and sham-flips the inserts between the two mesh trials. She then places the food reward in one of the food cups and places the baited cup at the end of the correct goal arm.Notes: Prior to each trial, the experimenter places the floor inserts onto the central stem and both goal arms of the T-maze. The two short left and right goal arm inserts and the half sized central stem insert will be the same color/texture. The goal inserts are used to help the rat learn and maintain the association of the conditional discrimination cue and the location of the food reward (e.g., Wood-Right or Mesh-Left). Our reasoning is that the absence or presence of food will enhance learning of the conditional discrimination if it occurs concomitantly with the presentation of the conditional cue. In the CDWM task, the inserts are half the size of the CDSTANDARD inserts. The central arm insert covers the first half of the central stem of the maze.",
    "The goal arm inserts cover the last half of the goal arms, farthest from the T-intersection. One side of the maze insert is covered with black mesh, and the other side is smooth wood (light brown). We have found that it is not necessary to fasten the removable inserts to the maze. The inserts fit snugly in the maze, so they are placed in the same location on every trial.In both tasks, conditional cues are associated with the location of food reward on the T-maze Rats are required to select either the left or right goal based on the texture and color (smooth wood or black mesh) of the floor insert. For example, rats learn to turn right at the T-intersection of the maze when they experience smooth, wood and turn left when they experience black mesh. Trials are presented in a pseudorandom sequence with equal numbers of mesh and wood trials per session (Fellows, 1967). The reward contingency is counterbalanced across rats, with half of the rats in an experiment learning to select the right goal arm on a mesh trial and the left goal arm on a wood trial and the other half of the rats learning the opposite rule (left on mesh, right on wood). The cue inserts are flipped between each trial, even if the same cue is presented on consecutive trials. Flipping cue inserts is done in order to ensure that the rat cannot solve the task by using auditory cues.Between each trial, rats wait in the start box for 20 sec while the experimenter prepared the maze for the next trial. A typical training session consisting of 24 trials (12 wood 12 mesh) takes about 30-40 min from beginning to end.",
    "Rats are given one session daily of CDWM until they perform the task at a criterion level of at least 80% correct choices on two consecutive sessions.CDWM task training (during either single or dual-task training) includes an additional phase. After rats reach performance criterion on CDWM with short left and right goal arm inserts and the half sized central arm insert, the short goal arm inserts are removed and rats are trained without them, leaving only the first half of the stem cued via the central arm insert. The same performance criterion is used for this phase of training.Next, rats begin the dual-task phase, learning either the CDWM or CDSTANDARD task while also continuing to perform the other task (inter-task interval 15-20 min). In CDSTANDARD, floor inserts were identical to the CDWM floor inserts except for the size of the inserts. CDSTANDARD inserts span the length of the central stem and goal arms of the T-maze. The tasks are identical in every way except for the length of cues available to the animals. Rats are trained on one session of CDSTANDARD and one session of CDWM per day. Task type order during dual-task training is counterbalanced. We have found that rats are able to perform daily training sessions of 18 CDSTANDARD trials (9 wood trials and 9 mesh trials) and 18 CDWM trials (9 wood trials and 9 mesh trials) for a total of 36 daily trials. A typical dual task session takes ~1.5 h to run per rat. Performance criterion is again set at a performance level of at least 80% correct choices on two consecutive dual-task sessions."
