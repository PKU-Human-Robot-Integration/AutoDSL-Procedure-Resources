    "Growing Arabidopsis plantsFill pots with the soil mix and top it off with a 2-cm layer of vermiculite (do not pack too tightly). Cover the pot with 7 x 7-inch fiberglass mesh screen (which prevents the leaves from contacting soil) and hold it in place with a rubber band. Place the pots in a tray and soak soil with an aqueous solution of Gnatrol (1 g L-1). Let it sit for one day. Note: This step is used to avoid development of fungus gnats.Mix Arabidopsis seeds in 5-10 ml of 0.1% agarose in a 15-ml centrifuge tube. Vortex the suspension for 10 sec at maximum speed to dispense the seeds evenly in agarose prior to sowing.Using a 1 ml micropipette, spot seeds (~5 seeds in one spot) in the four corners and the center of the pot. Label each pot with name, date, and genotype of seeds. Cover the tray with a plastic dome, leaving an opening of about 5-10 cm. Keep the tray in a cold room (4-8 °C) for 2 days to allow for efficient and synchronous germination (Figure 1A). imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170301/20170301090625_9005.jpgFigure 1. Dip-inoculation procedure. A. Arabidopsis seeds are sown on a mesh-covered pot and kept in a cold room (4-8 °C) for 2 days to allow for efficient and synchronous germination. B. Arabidopsis 4-5 weeks old plants are used for inoculation. C. The rosette is dipped and gently swirled in the inoculum. D. Inoculated plants are placed in a tray and incubated in an environment chamber. Note: If a growth chamber without relative humidity control is used, cover the tray with a plastic dome leaving a 5-10 cm gap open to keep air relative humidity between 60-70%.",
    "After two days, place the tray in growth chamber set at 22 °C, 65 ± 5% relative humidity (RH), and a 12-h photoperiod under photosynthetic active light intensity of 100 µmol m-2 sec-1. When seedlings are at the 2-leaf stage, thin the spots with forceps such that only one seedling is left at each spot and all 5 plants in the pot look about the same age. Add 0.2 g fertilizer per liter of soil mix as suggested by the manufacturer. Water is added to the tray as needed; generally, 1 L of water per tray 2 or 3 times per week is sufficient. Do not overwater to avoid moisture buildup, growth of algae, and fungus gnat proliferation. Bacterial inoculum preparationFrom the glycerol stock, streak Pseudomonas syringae from a culture stock on low-salt Luria Bertani (LS-LB) medium supplemented with appropriate antibiotic (e.g., Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 is cultured in media containing 100 µg ml-1 of rifampicin). Incubate the plates at 28 °C for approximately 30 h. Once colonies appear on the plate, it can be stored at 4 °C for up to 10 days. In the morning of the day before inoculation, prepare the pre-inoculum by inoculating one colony from this fresh plate into 10 ml of LS-LB with appropriate antibiotic. Additionally, incubate 10 ml of LS-LB to use as a control for culture contamination and to set the standard (blank) for the spectrophotometer reading. Incubate the culture tubes at 28 °C and 200 rpm.After growing the pre-inoculum for approximately 8 h take the optical density (OD) at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer. To make the inoculum, dilute the pre-inoculum to 300 ml of fresh liquid LS-LB medium and the appropriate antibiotic to obtain an OD600 of 0.004. Use the equation V1 x C1 = V2 x C2.",
    "A 10-ml blank should also be included to calibrate the spectrophotometer.Incubate at 28 °C and 200 rpm until mid to late log phase is reached (OD600 of 0.8 to 1). It will take approximately 12 h.Collect the bacterial cells by centrifugation at 2,600 x g for 20 min at room temperature. Resuspend the cell pellet in sterile, distilled water to an OD600 of 0.2, which corresponds to the final inoculum concentration of 1 x 108 CFU ml-1. High inoculum concentration is required to ensure uniform infection of the leaf and avoid sampling problems and large experimental errors. Inoculum must be used immediately to avoid killing bacterial cells. Alternatively, a 1-10 mM MgCl2 solution can be used to resuspend bacterial cells and minimize possible damage associated with osmotic pressure.  To accurately estimate the inoculum concentration, prepare a 10-time serial dilution of the inoculum and plate each dilution on square plates. See the description of serial dilution procedure in the section below (enumeration of apoplastic bacterium population). Add 0.02% Silwet L-77 to the inoculum to ensure that leaves are evenly covered with the inoculum; otherwise, inoculum will runoff and infection will be spotty. This step is required to guarantee reproducibility of the results.Leaf surface inoculation by dippingUse 4-5-week-old Arabidopsis plants with fully expanded leaves for infection (Figure 1B). Acclimate plants at 25 °C for approximately 12 h before inoculation. Environmental condition, other than temperature, must be the same as the used for plant growth.Dip-inoculate plants as shown in Figure 1C and Video 1. Swirl leaves for 5 sec to make sure all leaves are evenly coated with the inoculum. Drip excess inoculum and place the pot back in the tray (Figure 1D).     <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 1.",
    "Dip inoculation of Arabidopsis plants  Add some water in the tray and cover the tray leaving around 5-10 cm gap open such that air relative humidity of 60-65% is maintained. Note: High relative humidity (> 70%) is not recommended as it may interfere with stomatal defense (Panchal et al., 2016a). It is important to inoculate plants at the same time of the day to ensure reproducibility across biological replicates. It is well documented that the plant immune response and stomatal movement vary with the circadian rhythm (Zhang et al., 2013).Place the trays in an environmental chamber set at 25 °C, 60-65% RH, and a 12-h photoperiod under photosynthetic active light intensity of 100 µmol m-2 sec-1. If the environmental chamber has a humidity control, the plastic dome is not needed.Enumeration of apoplastic bacterium populationPluck three leaves from a single plant at the petiole making sure the leaf blade is not damaged by the forceps tip. Fully expanded leaves from the second layer from rosette bottom can be used (see healthy looking plants in Figure 2A). Note: It is highly recommended to do a time course experiment up to 3 days after inoculation. Grow all plants in the same batch for each experiment and use different plants from the same batch for each time point. The time course must include sampling right after inoculation (day 0) to obtain the initial level of total live bacterial population on the plant. For this first time point, leaves should not be sterilized as described in step D2. Do not use the younger (top) or older (bottom) leaves of the rosette, or stressed leaves with curved edges or purpling. For description of Arabidopsis growth stages, please see Boyes et al. (2001).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170301/20170301091313_5282.jpgFigure 2. Enumeration of the bacterial population in the leaf. A.",
    "Three equal sized infected leaves are plucked and surface sterilized with 70% ethanol. B. Fours leaf disks are cut from each leaf using a cork borer. C and D. Four leaf disks diluted and 10 μl from each dilution is spotted twice (technical replicates) on square plates. Repeat B-D for each of the three leaves.Place the leaves in 70% ethanol for 2 min. Next, put the leaves in sterile water for 1 min while rinsing it lightly from time to time in a way that the leaf blade is not damaged. Dry the leaves by blotting on paper towel. Sterilize the cork borer and forceps at every step from here on by rinsing in 70% ethanol and then in sterile water. Remove water from the cork borer by blotting on the paper towel. Using the cork borer number 2, which has an area of 0.125 cm2, punch out four leaf discs (total area of 0.5 cm2), two on either side of the midrib (Figure 2B). Use surface sterilized forceps to collect the punched-out leaf discs and put them in 100 µl sterile water in a microfuge tube (represented by the first tube in Figure 2C). Grind the tissue sample using a plastic pestle attached to a hand-held electric drill. No broken leaf pieces should be visible (see Video 2).     <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 2. Leaf tissue sampling and homogenization  Take 10 µl of this first solution and add to 90 µl of sterile water in another microfuge tube making a 1:10 dilution. Similarly, serially dilute until 10-6 for day 0 (Figure 2C) or until 10-8 for subsequent sampling time points. Pipet 10 µl from each tube and spot in one square of a Petri dish containing LS-LB medium with appropriate antibiotic (see Figure 2D).",
    "Each dilution should be spotted twice as technical replicates (first and second row on the plate shown in Figure 2D). (see Video 3)Repeat steps D5 to D8 (Figures 2B-2D) for each of the three leaves (Figure 2A). After plating all dilutions, let the plate air dry and incubate it at 28 °C for approximately 30 h.     <p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p>   Video 3.
