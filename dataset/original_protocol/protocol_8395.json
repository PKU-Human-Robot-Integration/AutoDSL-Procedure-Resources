    "All animal studies have been performed under approved protocols.\nNOTE: In this section, the sequence of the main phases performed during the experimental procedure and the suggested time interval is provided (Figure 1). Moreover, a step-by-step description of the protocol is supplemented by an illustrative panel, showing critical actions ranging from brain removal to tissue homogenization after the incubation period (Figure 2). The details regarding the materials and instructions to build the apparatus and the subsequent phase for the WB analysis are previously described22.\n1. Surgical Tools, Vibratome Settings and Treatment Preparation\nNOTE: Execute the following steps before starting the experimental procedure:\nPrepare two different artificial cerebrospinal fluids (aCSFs), one used for the brain slicing and the other for the incubation step as previously described29. Briefly, the working concentrations (in mmol) of the two aCSFs are for the \"slicing\" aCSF: 120 NaCl, 5 KCl, 20 NaHCO3, 2.4 CaCl2, 2 MgSO4, 1.2 KH2PO4, and 10 glucose; 6.7 HEPES salt and 3.3 HEPES acid; pH: 7.1. While for the \"recording\" aCSF: 124 NaCl, 3.7 KCl, 26 NaHCO3, 2 CaCl2, 1.3 MgSO4, 1.3 KH2PO4, and 10 glucose; pH: 7.1.\nMix well the solutions and then put on ice and oxygenate the slicing aCSF in order to have it cold while removing the brain and the subsequent sectioning. Keep at room temperature (RT) and supply oxygen to the recording aCSF.\nPlace the instruments under the dissection hood for the decapitation and brain removal, i.e., guillotine, surgical dissection kit (scissors, forceps, blades), and spatula.\nSet up the vibratome parameters by selecting the slice thickness (300 µm in this preparation) and the frequency at 7 and the speed at 6. Insert the vibratome chamber in its appropriate space and surround it with ice.",
    "Open the carbogen (95% O2, 5% CO2) valve to oxygenate the \"slicing\" (aCSF) during the brain sectioning. Select the minimum flow rate, around 2 mL/min.\nTake two 15-mL tubes to prepare the conditions to test. Add in one tube 10 mL of the \"recording\" aCSF alone (control group) and in the other, 10 mL of the \"recording\" aCSF enriched with T30 at a concentration of 2 µM (treated group). Vortex both tubes and keep them on ice until their use in the setup preparation phase (section 3).\n2. Anesthesia, Brain Extraction and Slicing\nNOTE: In this study, 9 wild type P14 male Wistar rats were used. Brain extraction and subsequent slicing constitute a critical part of the protocol since they should be quickly performed (within 10 min) in order to prevent or at least slow down tissue degeneration processes.\nAdd 1.5 mL of 100% w/w of isoflurane on a cotton layer into the induction chamber, place the animal inside, and close the lid. Wait until the animal is deeply anesthetized, confirming the absence of the pedal reflex, and then decapitate the animal using the guillotine.\nKeep the head of the animal within a pot containing ice-cold slicing aCSF during the brain removal step (Figure 2A - C).\nIncise the skin over the skull with a surgical blade, then cut the skull using scissors following the midline, from the posterior part and proceed anteriorly until reaching the bone above the OBs (Figure 2A).\nPull laterally the two sides of the skull using a pair of forceps in order to have access to the brain (Figure 2B). Insert a spatula ventrally to the brain, gently scoop it out, and keep it hydrated in ice-cold \"slicing\" aCSF for approximately 5 min (Figure 2C).",
    "Dispose the brain on filter paper and cut out the cerebellum using a blade (Figure 2D). Glue the brain vertically on the vibratome disc and insert it inside the sectioning chamber, fill it with ice-cold \"slicing\" aCSF, and provide oxygen (Figure 2E).\nAdjust the cutting interval, and proceed with the brain sectioning (Figure 2F). Collect the sections containing the region of interest, such as the medial septum (MS), diagonal band of Broca (DBB), and substantia innominata (SI), as previously described22. From top to the bottom, the three slices contain the rostral (R), intermediate (I), and caudal (C) portion of the BF (Figure 2G).\nDivide along the midline each section with small scissors, obtaining two specular hemislices (Figure 2H), used individually as the control and treated condition at the same anatomical plane.\nKeep the hemisections in the vibratome chamber for 5 - 10 min, then transfer them with a glass pipette into a bubbling pot containing recording aCSF. Keep at RT for approximately 30 min to recover.\nFill, in the meantime, three glass vials with 3 mL of recording aCSF alone (previously prepared in step 1.6) for the control group and three vials with 3 mL of aCSF enriched with T30 (previously prepared in step 1.6) for the treated group.\n3. Setup Preparation\nTransfer the hemisections into their corresponding glass vials (Figure 2I) in order to have three consecutive hemislices (including the rostral, intermediate, and caudal BF region) for the control group (green frame, Figure 2J) and their matching counterparts for the treated group (red frame, Figure 2J).\nTransfer the brain tissue with two different brushes, one for the control hemislices and another for the treated counterparts, in order to prevent any contamination between conditions.",
    "Seal each glass vial with the corresponding lid, presenting the oxygenating needle (21G) (Figure 2J). Connect the main tube of the apparatus to the carbogen source (Figure 2K). Deliver oxygen to the hemislices throughout the incubation period with a minimal flow rate of 2 mL/min in order to avoid any movement of the brain tissue and possible mechanical damage during the experiment. Start the 5 h incubation. Execute the steps 3.1 - 3.3 within 5 min.\n\tNOTE: Check frequently (every 15 - 20 min) whether the oxygen is supplied into all the vials and that its flow is not moving the tissue from the bottom.\n4. Sample Homogenization\nStop the oxygen flow after the incubation and remove all the lids from the vials. Transfer the hemislices, using the proper brushes, into 1.5 mL tubes containing 250 µL of lysis buffer, maintaining the tubes on ice (Figure 2L). To make the lysis buffer, mix PBS 1x with phosphatase and protease inhibitors cocktails both diluted at 1:100, and homogenize the tissue with different pestles to prevent contamination among the samples. Complete these actions within 10 - 15 min.\nCentrifuge the brain lysate at 1,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant into new tubes and keep the samples at -80 °C.\n5. Reading of the Protein Concentration and Western Blot Analysis\nDetermine the protein concentration of each sample and subsequently prepare the aliquots for Western blot analysis as previously described22.\nPerform statistical analysis to evaluate the effects of the treatment on protein expression.\nSubscription Required.
