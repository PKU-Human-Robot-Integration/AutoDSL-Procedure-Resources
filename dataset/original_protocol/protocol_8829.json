    "NOTE: All research volunteers in this study were administered informed consent documents approved by the Institutional Review Board of Howard University and Johns Hopkins University. Only participants who consented by signing the informed consent documents were enrolled into the study. The study base for this analysis consisted of: 20 subjects (12 BD and 10 controls; 30% males) and mean age (s.d.) of 38.2 (14.1) years.\nNOTE: Spray all surfaces with RNase Zap to remove RNase contamination from glass and plastic surfaces.\n1. Biopsy Procedure\nSpray topical lidocaine (xylocaine) liquid 4% and oxymetazoline HCl 0.05% in the nasal cavity of the study participant and allow 15 mins of numbing time.\nSoak ½ x 3 inch surgical cottonoids in a mixture of lidocaine and oxymetazoline and insert in the nasal cavity along superior portion of the nasal septum and allow to sit for 15 min.\nUsing a 30° rigid nasal endoscope to locate the upper section of the nasal cavity, remove nasal mucosa using up-biting nasal forceps from the superior portion of the nasal septum, taking several small specimens.\n2. Preparation of Tissue Blocks\nImmediately prior to biopsy, fill standard sized cryomolds with tissue freezing medium.\nUsing autoclaved tweezers, mount fresh tissue in the freezing medium and freeze on dry ice. Fill remainder of cryoblock with the freezing medium, freeze cryoblock on dry ice, and store blocks at -80ºC.\n3. Cryosectioning\nPrepare polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) membrane glass slides immediately prior to cryosectioning. Spray slides with RNase Zap solution for 5 min. Then rinse slides in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) water and let air dry for 30 min. Activate dried slides under UV light for 30 mins.\nCryosection each block entirely at 30 µm. Keep slides on dry ice, and sections frozen as much as possible. Store slides at -80 ºC upon completion.",
    "4. Laser-Capture Microdissection\nBegin by dehydrating slides immediately prior to microdissection. Let frozen slides thaw for 10 sec, and then apply the following ethanol series to each slide: 60% (2 ml, 15 sec), 80% (2 ml, 15 sec), 95% (3 ml, 25 sec), 100% (7 ml, 60 sec).\nTurn photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) microscope on and set to the following conditions: For 10X magnification set the energy to 82, focus to 74, and speed to 25 - 30. For 20X magnification, set the energy to 63, focus to 67, and speed to 5 - 6. Adjust as necessary to obtain optimal cutting results.\nVisually identify neurons using 20X or 10X magnification. Distinguish the thin surface olfactory neuron layer from underlying sub-mucosa under a microscope without the use of staining procedure. Observe neurons as a dense columnar appearance18.\nUsing the Pencil function in the afore-mentioned microscope in step 4.2, trace around the neuronal layer. Trace slightly away from neurons to prevent burning of neurons from laser. This is essential for obtaining high quality RNA. Then initiate laser guided cutting.\nPick up dissected sections using fine tip microdissection forceps and put tissue in a microtube containing 100 µl lysis buffer on ice. Repeat for all neuronal sections obtained from a single sample. Total dissection time per sample should not exceed 50 min.\nOnce dissection is complete, immediately vortex sample lysates and keep on dry ice. Store samples at -80ºC for total RNA isolation.\n5. Isolation of Total RNA and Quality Control Analysis\nThaw sample lysates on ice. Carry out total RNA isolation with RNAqueous Micro Kit with DNase-I inactivation by following manufacturer's protocol with no modifications (see Figure 1). The total elution volume is approximately 20 µl.",
    "Measure RNA concentration and evaluate RNA quality with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) using Bioanalyzer. Samples that meet the quality control criteria in Figure 2 can be used for cDNA synthesis.\n6. cDNA Synthesis\nSynthesize cDNA using a validated commercial kit (see Table of Reagents). Perform the annealing step by combining 0.1 - 1.0 ng of RNA (depending on availability) and RNase free water to a total volume of 8 μl per tube. Then add 1 μl of oligo d(T)20 primer and 1 μl of 10 mM dNTP mix per tube, for a total volume of 10 μl.\nGently vortex and centrifuge samples and anneal samples at 65 °C for 5 min. After the reaction is completed, immediately cool samples on ice.\nPrepare master mix solution according to the specifications in Table 1. Then add 9.5 µl master mix and 0.5 µl of commercially prepared reverse transcriptase (RT) to each tube. Add 0.5 µl RNase-free water to control tube instead of RT.\nRun a RT reaction with the first incubation at 50 ºC for 50 min, then 85 ºC for 5 min and a final 4 ºC hold, with no cycling.\nDilute all samples by 5x with water and aliquot. Store samples at -80 ºC.\n7. Real Time PCR – Confirm Neuronal Enrichment\nPrepare the master mix solution according to specifications in Table 2. Use an internal control such as GAPDH. Compare olfactory marker protein (OMP) expression in microdissected tissue with OMP expression in undissected tissue to determine neuronal enrichment.\n\tNOTE: OMP is a marker for olfactory neurons.\n\tOMP sequence: forward, 5’-CTGTCGGACCTGGCCAAG-3’\n\treverse, 5’-CACCCTCGCCAAAGGTGA-3’\n\tGAPDH sequence: forward, 5’-CATGAGAAGTATGACAACAGCCT-3’\n\treverse, 5’-AGTCCTTCCACGATACCAAAGT-3’.\nSet up PCR plate by adding 7 µl of master mix in each well and 3 µl of cDNA.",
    "Centrifuge plate for 5 min at 300 x g (1,300 rpm). Run Real Time-PCR reaction using the default thermal cycling conditions specified for commercial supermix such as SYBR GreenER qPCR.\nAnalyze data (see Figure 2 for specifications).\n8. Real Time PCR – Expression of Genes of Interest\nPerform on samples that show neuronal enrichment of 2 fold or more.\nPrepare master mix on ice for each probe (FAM-labeled probe of interest and VIC-labeled GAPDH) in separate tubes according to the specifications in Table 3.\nSet up a PCR plate with 8 µl master mix in each well and 2 µl of cDNA.\nCentrifuge the plate for 5 min at 300 x g (1,300 rpm). Run Real Time-PCR reaction using the default thermal cycling conditions as per the gene expression master mix protocol provided by the manufacturer. Analyze expression results (see Figure 2 for specifications).\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
