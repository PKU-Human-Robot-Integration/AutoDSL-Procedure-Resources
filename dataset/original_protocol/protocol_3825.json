    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nCell synchronization\nTiming: 50 h\nCell-cycle progression is orchestrated via complex networks of reversible posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation, ubiquitination and SUMOylation (Fisher et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3], Kirkin and Dikic, 2007[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9], Wan et al., 2012[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). Nuclear proteins are often phosphorylated during mitosis (Jesper V. Olsen et al., 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]). This part of protocol is used to study whether the transcription factor of interest undergoes phosphorylation during mitosis and identify kinase responsible for its phosphorylation. The method can also be used to study other posttranslational modifications, such as ubiquitination and SUMOylation.\nThymidine, an effective inhibitor of DNA synthesis, can arrest cells in either G1 prior to DNA replication or S phase. If thymidine is removed, cells can reenter the cell-cycle progression. When subjected to double thymidine block (TT block), cells can be synchronized at G1/S boundary (Uzbekov, 2004[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12], Fang et al., 1998[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]). After releasing into normal medium, cells can be collected at different time points and analyzed by Western Blot to determine whether a transcription factor undergoes modification during mitosis.\nCells are cultured in 3.5-cm virgin polystyrene plates (n=8) with 20% confluence for 18∼24 h.\nReplace medium with 2 mL fresh medium containing 2 mM thymidine in incubator at 37°C for 16 h.\nThe medium with thymidine should be freshly prepared right before added to cells.\nThe confluence of cells is about 40% now.\nRemove medium containing thymidine completely and wash cells two times with 2 mL pre-warmed 1× PBS buffer and discard PBS.\n1× PBS buffer is pre-warmed in incubator at 37°C.\nCritical: Ensure that thymidine is completely removed during releasing because a residual amount of thymidine can delay mitotic progression.\nAdd 2 mL fresh medium without thymidine to cells and place the cells in incubator at 37°C for 8 h.",
    "Discard the medium and add 2 mL fresh medium containing 2 mM thymidine for another 16 h in incubator at 37°C.\nCells are now synchronized at the G1/S boundary and its confluence is around 80%.\nCells are washed twice with 2 mL pre-warmed 1× PBS buffer, and released into fresh medium without thymidine again for 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 h.\n1× PBS buffer and fresh medium are pre-warmed in incubator at 37°C.\nDiscard the medium followed by washing cells with 2 mL 1× PBS buffer carefully; store plates with cells in −80°C freezer until lysis.\nFor kinase inhibitors treatment, discard the medium and add 2 mL pre-warmed (37°C) fresh medium containing 0.1% DMSO (vehicle control), 5 μM RO3306 (CDK1 inhibitor), 0.25 μM BI2536 (PLK1 inhibitor), or 5 μM VX680 (Aurora A inhibitor) to the mitotic cells for 15 min in incubator at 37°C.\nCritical: Because of decreased adherence, mitotic cells should be washed with caution to avoid their loss. If mitotic cells are already suspended in media, they can be collected by centrifuge at 850 × g for 3 min.\nLyse cells in plates with RIPA buffer and measure protein concentration using BCA Protein Assay Kit. Cell lysates are now ready for Western blot analysis.\nCell lysates can be stored at −80°C for a few days before Western blot analysis.\nPause Point: Cell lysates can be stored at −80°C before Western blot analysis.\nNote: Both Ser10 of histone H3 (S10-H3) and threonine210 of PLK1 (PLK1-Thr210) are heavily phosphorylated during mitosis, which can be used as mitotic markers in this protocol.",
    "Note: Collecting cells at the peak of mitosis is crucial their subsequent analysis including Western Blot, immunofluorescence, in situ PLA and centrosome isolation. If you use other cell lines, you should examine their morphology under light microscope every other hour after they are released from TT block, because most animal cells undergo a near spherical morphology during mitosis, known as mitotic cell rounding (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). In our study, mitosis is peaked with 60% mitotic cells at 10 h after cells are released from TT block. So, we collect cells at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 h after they are released from TT block and analyze them by Western Blot using anti-pT210-PLK1 and anti-pS10-H3 antibodies. Unexpectedly, we found that RXRα undergoes phosphorylation during mitosis, implying that phosphorylated RXRα (p-RXRα) may be involved in mitotic progression. An example of such an analysis is presented in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/742-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1.

    "Note: Cdk1, PLK1 and Aurora A are master kinases that phosphorylate numerous substrates to regulate mitotic progression (Joukov and Nicolo, 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13], Lindqvist et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). If a transcription factor undergoes phosphorylation during mitosis, it is likely that one of these kinases is responsible, which can be easily studied by using chemical inhibitors of these kinases. We used several inhibitors to help identify Cdk1 as the kinase responsible for RXRα phosphorylation (Xie et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). There are two key points that one should pay attention when using a kinase inhibitor. First, a kinase inhibitor should be added to cells already synchronized at mitotic phase, but not asynchronous cells, in order to avoid its effect on mitotic progression. Secondly, the treatment of mitotic cells with a kinase inhibitor should be as short as possible to exclude its indirect effect on the phosphorylation of nuclear proteins.\nImmunofluorescence\nTiming: 10 h or 18∼20 h",
    "Mitosis is characterized by dramatic changes in chromatin organization and gene expression in eukaryotic cells. Transcription factors are dissociated from mitotic chromatins when they are condensed during mitosis (Martínez-Balbás et al., 1995[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11], Egli et al., 2008[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2], Palozola et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]). Their localization and function during mitosis remains an enigma in the field. There are numerous proteins found to be associated with different subcellular organelles during mitosis, including centrosome, kinetochore, central spindle and midbody, hence playing a role in regulating the mitotic progression (Zitouni et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). This part of the protocol aims to study the localization of a transcription factor from interphase to mitotic phase when it is dissociated from mitotic chromatin. Although the protocol is used to examine the accumulation of the nuclear protein at the centrosome upon phosphorylation, it can also be used to determine whether it resides at other subcellular organelles, such as kinetochore, central spindle and midbody.\nCells are mounted on 8 mm× 8 mm round glass coverslip in 24-well plate with 20% confluence for 18∼24 h, followed by TT block (steps 2∼5)\nRound glass coverslip should be clean and sterile, which is placed in the well before culture medium containing cells is added to the well.\nTransfect cells with plasmids containing mCherry-tagged or EGFP-tagged transcription factor of interest during the second thymidine arrest if you want to confirm the localization of the transcription factor (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D).\nCells are released into fresh medium without thymidine for 10 h after washed twice with 1 mL pre-warmed (37°C) 1× PBS buffer.\nFor kinase inhibitor treatment, discard the medium and add 500 μL pre-warmed (37°C) fresh medium containing 0.1% DMSO, 10 μM RO3306 (CDK1 inhibitor), or other inhibitors, such as PLK1 inhibitor BI2536 or Aurora A inhibitor XV680, to mitotic cells for one more hour.",
    "Wash one time with 500 μL 1× PBS buffer per well and discard PBS.\nThe following steps (10∼12) are also performed in wells.\nCritical: Because the adherence of mitotic cells on coverslips is weak, you should gently perform the experiments below to avoid the loss of mitotic cells.\nCells are fixed with 500 μL −20°C methanol for 10 min at 4°C or 4% paraformaldehyde prepared in 1× PBS buffer for 10 min at 20°C∼25°C.\nMethanol should be pre-cooled at −20°C.\nAfter discarding the fixing buffer, cells are washed twice by 500 μL 1× PBS buffer, then permeabilized with 500 μL 0.05% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS buffer for 8 min at 4°C.\n0.05% Triton X-100 should be pre-cooled at 4°C.\nCells are then washed twice with 1×PBS again and blocked with 500 μL 1% Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) in 1× PBS for 30 min at 20°C∼25°C.\nBlocking buffer (BSA in 1× PBS buffer) should be prepared right before use.\nPause Point: Blocking can be run for 12∼16 h at 4°C.\nTransfer the coverslips from 24-well plate to a covered dish to prevent fluorochrome fading.\nDiscard blocking buffer and incubate cells with 20 μL primary antibody diluted with blocking buffer per coverslip at 20°C∼25°C for 3 h.\nYou should use 20 μL pipette tips to discard blocking buffer carefully and ensure that no liquid is left on coverslips. This prevents dilution of primary antibody.\nThe dilution of primary antibody is often 1:100∼1:200 depending on the valence of antibody. In our case, the dilution of anti-RXRα antibody (rabbit polyclonal antibody), anit-PLK1 antibody (mouse monoclonal antibody) and anti-γ-tubulin antibody (mouse monoclonal antibody) is 1:100, 1:200 and 1:1,000, respectively.\nPause Point: Incubation of primary antibody can be run for 12∼16 h at 4°C.",
    "Remove primary antibody and wash with 200 μL 1× PBS (3× 5 min).\nFor last wash, ensure that there is no much liquid left on coverslips to prevent the dilution of the secondary antibody.\nIncubate cells with 20 μL FITC-labeled Goat anti-Mouse IgG (1:200) diluted with blocking buffer to detect PLK1 or γ-tubulin and Cy3-labeled Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (1:200) diluted with blocking buffer to visualize RXRα at 20°C∼25°C for 1 h.\nDish should be covered during incubation to avoid fluorochrome fading.\nSecond antibody is removed and cells are stained with 20 μL 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (1:10,000 dilution) in 1× PBS at 20°C∼25°C for 5 min to visualize nuclei.\nDiscard DAPI and wash cells in 200 μL 1× PBS (4× 5 min).\nTap off excess PBS from coverslips and wash them in double distilled water for 3 sec by using tweezers. Then remove the residual water from coverslips and mount them on the glass slides using 3 μL mounting medium.\nFor removing residual water, you can use paper towel to carefully touch the edge of coverslips so that water is absorbed.\nMounting medium containing DAPI can be used instead of a separate DAPI staining step.\nCritical: Because 1×PBS buffer can form white crystal and impact the imaging if it dries, washing the coverslips using double distilled water before mounting is necessary.\nPlace slides in dark at 20°C∼25°C for 2 h to dry them before analyzing.\nImages are taken under a LEICA TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope system (Leica).\nConventional confocal microscopy should be good for imaging, and the 40× or 63× oil objective is recommended.",
    "Interphase or mitotic cells undergoing different stages of mitotic phase can be easily identified according to the morphology of nucleus and chromosome revealed by DAPI staining. In our case, we examined the subcellular localization of endogenous RXRα during mitosis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C), and found that RXRα is colocalized with γ-tubulin, a known centrosomal marker, during prophase of mitosis, although it mainly resides in the nucleus at this stage of mitosis. RXRα association with the centrosome became very prominent during prometaphase and metaphase. After cells exit from mitosis, RXRα returned back to the nucleus. Furthermore, transfected mCherry-tagged RXRα also colocalized with PLK1 at the centrosome in mitotic cells (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D). These results allowed us to conclude that RXRα translocates from the nucleus to the centrosome during mitosis.\nFor the identification of kinase responsible for RXRα phosphorylation, we found that RO3306 can inhibit centrosomal RXRα staining, which help us concluding that Cdk1-dependent phosphorylation of RXRα is required for its centrosomal translocation (Xie et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]).\nAfter imaging, slides can be stored at −20°C in dark for up to 6 months.\nNote: In order to have enough time for transfected plasmids to express protein and to avoid interference with S-phase completion (Arroyo et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]), we suggest that you perform the transfection experiment once cells are released from first thymidine arrest.\nNote: Different fixing reagents are required for the exposure of different antigens. So, the choice of fixing reagents depends on the primary antibody used. In our case, methanol is suitable for anti-γ-tubulin antibody. But both of methanol and paraformaldehyde can be used for anti-RXRα and anti-PLK1 antibodies. You can find further information at: https://blog.cellsignal.com/successful-immunofluorescence-fixation-and-permeabilization[href=https://blog.cellsignal.com/successful-immunofluorescence-fixation-and-permeabilization], or check the datasheet of antibody of interest or related publications for optimal fixation conditions.\nIn situ proximity ligation assay (PLA)\nTiming: 8∼10 h",
    "Cdk1 phosphorylation of their substrates provides them with docking sites for recruiting PLK1, which may occur at distinct subcellular localizations, such as centrosome, kinetochore and central spindle (Zitouni et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]). In situ PLA is a powerful technique that visualizes protein interaction in situ (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). We used this method to detect the interaction of RXRα and PLK1 at the centrosome. The protocol is performed using a Doulink assay kit (Sigma/Aldrich) based on the manufacturer’s instructions (https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/protocols/biology/duolink-fluorescence-user-manual.html[href=https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/protocols/biology/duolink-fluorescence-user-manual.html]) with modifications. The protocol can also be modified to study whether the interaction occurs at a distinct subcellular structure during mitosis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/742-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. The principle of In situ proximity ligation assay (PLA)\nThis figure is re-edited from the original figures distributed by Sigma company.\nMount cells with 15%∼20% confluence on 8 mm× 8 mm round glass coverslip in 24-well plate for 18∼24 h, followed by TT block (steps 2∼5).\nIn manufacturer’s instruction, cells should be deposited on glass slides. But we have modified it so that cells are mounted on glass coverslip.\nCells are released into fresh medium without thymidine for 10 h after washed twice with 1 mL pre-warmed (37°C) 1× PBS buffer.\nThe optimal confluence of cells is 50%∼70%.\nWash cells twice with 500 μL 1× PBS buffer per well and discard PBS.\nThe following steps (26∼28) are also performed in 24-well plate.\nAll wash steps below should be performed at 20°C∼25°C.\nFix cells with 500 μL cold methanol (−20°C) for 5 min at 4°C.\nPause Point: After fixation, cells can be left in 1× PBS at 4°C for several days.\nAfter discard fixing buffer, cells are washed twice by 500 μL 1× PBS buffer, then permeabilized with 500 μL 0.05% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS buffer for 8 min at 4°C.",
    "Wash cells two times by 1× PBS and transfer the coverslips from 24-well plate to a covered dish.\nPlace some wet cotton balls around the inner edge of the covered dish to prevent coverslips from drying.\nWe use a covered dish with wet cotton balls instead of a humidity chamber suggested by manufacturer’s instruction.\nBlock cells with a drop of Blocking Solution per coverslip for 60 min at 37°C incubator.\nBlocking Solution and the following reagents except primary antibodies are supplied by the company.\nBe sure to cover the entire sample with Blocking Solution.\nPause Point: Blocking can be run for 12∼16 h at 4°C.\nDiscard Blocking Solution and incubate cells with 25 μL primary antibody diluted in Antibody Diluent per coverslip for 60 min at 37°C incubator.\nFor 8 mm× 8 mm round coverslip, 25 μL of solution is enough for coverage.\nUse 20 μL pipette tips to tap off Blocking Solution as much as possible to prevent dilution of the primary antibody.\nDilute your primary antibodies to a suitable concentration. In our case, the dilution of anti-RXRα antibody and anit-PLK1 antibody is 1:100 and 1:300, respectively.\nPause Point: Incubation of primary antibody can be run for 12∼16 h at 4°C.\nDiscard primary antibody solution and wash coverslips 4 × 5 min with 1× Wash Buffer A.\nIn order to reduce the background signal, we increase the times of washing in this step and the following steps, which are more than that suggested by the manufacturer’s instruction.\nTap off excess wash buffer to avoid dilution of the PLA probe solution.\nIncubate cells with PLA labeled secondary antibodies (anti-mouse, MINUS; anti-rabbit, PLUS) for 60 min in a 37°C incubator.",
    "For a 25 μL reaction, take 5 μL PLA probe MINUS stock, 5 μL PLA probe PLUS stock and 15 μL Antibody Diluent. If multiple coverslips are used, you can scale up volume accordingly.\nDiscard the PLA probe solution and wash the coverslips 4× 5 min again with 1× Wash Buffer A.\nAdd 25 μL of Ligation solution including ligase to each coverslip for 30 min at 37°C incubator.\nFor a 25 μL reaction, first add 5 μL the 5× Ligation buffer to 20 μL ultrapure water to obtain 25 μL 1× Ligation buffer, then add 0.625 μL of Ligase to 24.375 μL 1× Ligation buffer. If multiple coverslips are used, scale up volumes accordingly.\nDiscard ligation solution and wash coverslips 4× 5 min with 1× Wash Buffer A.\nIncubate cells with 25 μL Amplification buffer including polymerase per coverslips for 100 min at 37°C incubator.\nFor 25 μL reaction, first add 5 μL 5× Amplification buffer to 20 μL ultrapure water to obtain25 μL 1× Amplification buffer, then add 0.3125 μL Polymerase to 24.6875 μL 1× Amplification buffer. If multiple coverslips are used, scale up volumes accordingly.\nDiscard the amplification solution and wash the coverslips 3× 5 min with 1× Wash Buffer B and one time in 0.01× Wash Buffer B for 1 min.\nTap off excess wash buffer from coverslips at the last step.\nMount coverslips by using a minimal volume of mounting medium with DAPI.\nUse clear nail polish to seal the edge of coverslips to the glass slides because the mounting medium is aqueous and does not solidify.\nTransferring mounting medium to glass slide by 20 μL pipette carefully and slowly to avoid air bubbles under the coverslip.",
    "Place glass slide in dark at 20°C∼25°C for 15 min before analyzing in a LEICA TCS SP8 confocal laser scanning microscope system (Leica).\nConventional confocal microscopy combined with 40× or 63× oil objective is good for detecting the interaction.\nThe PLA signal is recognized as red fluorescent spots in cells. In our case, PLA fluorescent spots at the centrosome during mitosis can only be observed when both antibodies are present, demonstrating the high specificity of the interaction. The PLA result can be used to illustrate the interaction between RXRα and PLK1 and the location that the interaction occurs during mitosis (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]E).\nAfter imaging, store slides in the dark at 4°C for up to 4 days or at −20°C for up to 6 months.\nCritical: For PLA experiment, the identification of optimal conditions for primary antibodies, including sample processing (fixation and permeabilization), antibody concentration, blocking solution and antibody diluent, is crucial. We suggest to use IF staining to identify conditions for primary antibody, which can then be used for PLA experiment. However, because PLA provides greater sensitivity and signal amplification as compared to IF, the concentration of primary antibodies used for PLA may be less than that used for IF.\nCritical: Make sure that reagents and buffers are prepared and stored under their recommended conditions and that some reagents are completely thawed (e.g., ligation buffer and amplification buffer) and resolved prior to usage.\nNote: Perform all steps at the appropriate incubation times for best results, in particular the primary antibody incubation step and enzymatic steps (ligation and amplification).\nNote: The use of negative controls (e.g., isotype IgG) is highly recommended when performing PLA experiment.",
    "Note: It is important that images should be taken with the same acquisition parameters between experimental and control samples. Settings can be optimized using positive negative controls.\nCentrosome isolation\nTiming: 6 h\nThe presence of a nuclear protein at the centrosome can also be detected by Western blot analysis of purified centrosomes So, this part of the protocol is used to prepare centrosomes from mammalian cultured cells, which is adapted from (Wigley et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14], Gogendeau et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) with modifications, followed by separation of cellular components through a discontinuous sucrose gradient (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/742-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. The procedure of centrosome isolation\nCells cultured in 10-cm plates (n=20) are released from TT block for 10 h, and treated with 1 μg/mL cytochalasin D and 0.2 μM nocodazole for 1 h at 37°C to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules.\nCytochalasin D and nocodazole are added to the medium.\nAfter the treatment, all subsequent steps are carried out at 4°C.\nCollect the cells in 50 mL centrifugation tube by centrifugation at 350 × g for 8 min.\nThe adherence of cells at this stage is weak, so they can be detached from plates by pipetting up and down a few times (3-5 times) before harvesting.\nWash the resulting cell pellet in 20 mL 1× PBS buffer and centrifuge cells at 350 × g for 8 min, followed by resuspending with 20 mL of 0.1× PBS/8% sucrose.\nCells should be handled carefully afterward because they swell due to the hypotonic media.",
    "Cells are recentrifuged at 350 × g for 8 min and resuspended in 2 mL 0.1× TBS/8% sucrose followed immediately by addition of 8 mL lysis buffer. The cell suspension is gently shaken and passed five times through a 10-mL narrow-mouth serological pipette to lyse cells. Place cell lysate on ice for 5 min.\nTake an aliquot of 50 μL as the whole cell extract (WCE) and store it in −80°C refrigerator.\nCell lysate is centrifuged once more at 2,500 × g for 10 min to remove swollen nuclei, chromatin aggregates, and unlysed cells.\nThe resulting supernatant is filtered through a 70 μm Nylon Cell Strainer into a 50 mL centrifugation tube.\nAdd 1 M Hepes to the supernatant to obtain a final concentration of 10 mM Hepes.\nAdd DNase I to the supernatant to a final concentration of 1 μg/mL. Mix well and incubate the supernatant on ice for 30 min.\nThe mixture is gently underlaid with 1 mL of 60% sucrose solution and spun at 10,000 × g for 30 min to sediment centrosomes onto the cushion.\nRemove the upper 8 mL of the supernatant carefully and the remainder, including the cushion, containing the concentrated centrosomes is gently vortexed.\nPrepare a discontinuous sucrose gradient in a 14× 89 mm Ultra-Clear Centrifuge Tube (Beckman) by adding the tube with 3 mL 70% sucrose, 3 mL 50% sucrose, and 3 mL 40% sucrose solution orderly.\n70% sucrose, 50% sucrose, and 40% sucrose solutions should be prepared separately prior to use.\nUse the Pasteur pipet to add the sucrose solution along the inner wall of centrifuge tube slowly.\nThe reminder is then loaded onto the discontinuous sucrose gradient from the bottom and spun at 25,600 × g for 1 h in a Beckman Preparative Ultracentrifuge with an SW28 rotor.",
    "Fractions is collected by Piston Gradient Fractionator (BIOCOMP) and subjected to Western blot analysis.\nThe volume of discontinuous sucrose gradient is 9 mL, and fractions are collected from the top by 200 μL/fraction. Usually centrosomes are enriched in fractions nearby the boundary between 50% and 70% sucrose. Fractions can be stored in −80°C refrigerator for a few weeks before further analysis.\nPause Point: Fractions can be stored in −80°C refrigerator before further analysis.\nFor Western blot analysis, 8% SDS-PAGE gel made by ourselves is appropriate. Fractions are boiled in SDS sample loading buffer with 20 μL/fraction.\nIn our study, pS56-RXRα coaccumulates with the centrosome marker γ-tubulin. β-actin (a housekeeping protein) and Lamin B1 (a nuclear protein) are used as negative controls. This result indicates that pS56-RXRα localizes at centrosome (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]F).\nNote: After cytochalasin D and nocodazole treatment, the adherence of mitotic cell on plates is very weak, so you can suspend mitotic cells into culture media by either using pipette or horizontal shaker.\nNote: The MgCl2 concentration during the lysis step is very important, because it is crucial for dissociation of centrosome from nucleus. The concentrations may range from 0.5 mM to 1 mM depending on cell types (Gogendeau et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]). For HeLa cells, the optimal concentration of MgCl2 is 0.5 mM (Wigley et al., 1999[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14])."
