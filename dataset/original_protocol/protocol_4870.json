    "Cardiac punctureThis section describes the cardiac puncture method for acquiring and handling a blood sample in preparation for measuring serum osmolality (see Note A1). Deep anesthesia will take approximately 10 min overall. Place the rat into the induction chamber. Adjust the oxygen flow rate to 1.5-2 L/min, and the isoflurane vapourizer to 5%. Once the rat has stopped moving for several minutes (2-4 min), it can be transferred onto the working surface and placed on the mask attached to a Bain circuit. Place the rat parallel to self in the supine position, with the head towards your non-dominant hand, and tail towards your dominant hand. Adjust the oxygen flow rate to 0.4-0.8 L/min and continue at 3-5% isoflurane.Verify that it is deeply anesthetized by using the tweezers to pinch the toes. The rat should not respond. Maintain the isoflurane at 3-5% (see Note A2). Test the plunger on the 5 ml tube, making sure that it moves smoothly. Leave the plunger slightly retracted. Attach the 21 G 1 ½ in. needle.Using your non-dominant hand, gently press the forelimbs down on the table and inwards into the body so that the claws face towards its hind legs and the forelimbs are parallel to the chest. This 'squeezing' of the forelimbs into the body will lift up the rib cage providing easier access to the heart.With your dominant hand, insert the needle to the anatomical left of the xiphoid process at a 30° angle (upwards from the chest) and slowly push it into the chest while maintaining a gentle negative pressure with the plunger (see Note A3). You may feel a resistance when you reach the heart, but this is not always the case.Once you have reached the heart, a small amount of blood will enter the syringe. Release the negative pressure.",
    "Let go of the forelimbs, and use your non-dominant hand to stabilize the syringe. Use your dominant hand to slowly pull back on the syringe. Once you have collected your desired amount of blood (see Note A4), gently apply a small positive pressure by pushing the plunger in, and pull the needle out. A bit of positive pressure will prevent hemolysis during retraction of the needle (see Note A5). Immediately transfer the blood in the syringe into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. To do so, remove the needle from the syringe and gently expel the blood into the tube. The blood will have begun to coagulate and if this step is done too quickly, it will cause hemolysis. Leave at room temperature (RT, ~22 °C) for 30-60 min, or place the tube on ice in an insulated foam container with the lid closed for a minimum of 30 min and up to 9 h (see Note A6 and Representative data). Follow up with a recommended physical method of euthanization (e.g., pneumothorax, cervical dislocation) as per your institution’s animal use guidelines. Serum separation This section describes the blood processing necessary to prepare the serum sample for osmolality measurement.Centrifuge the blood sample at 6,000 x g for 5 min. The resultant thick and dark red pellet will contain the haemocytes. The clear, off-white-to-yellow supernatant layer will contain the serum. 1.5 ml of blood provides approximately 0.5-0.7 ml of serum (see Notes B1 and B2).Pipette the supernatant into a fresh microcentrifuge tube. Be sure not to disturb the pellet when collecting the serum.Store at 4 °C until ready for further processing, making sure that the lid is completely closed to prevent evaporation.",
    "Osmolality measurementThis section starts by verifying the reliability of the osmometer by measuring a solution with a known osmolality value (290 mOsm/kg control solution), followed by the method of measuring serum osmolality.Make sure that your osmometer has been recently calibrated following the manufacturer’s guidelines, and is in good working order. This is a quality control step to test the osmometer (see Notes C1 and C2).Attach a sampler tip to the sampler. Use the sampler to draw 20 μl of the 290 mOsm/kg control solution. Wipe the outside of the sampler tip dry with a Kimwipe, including the tip perimeter. Blot excess sample so that the meniscus is in line with the tip or slightly concave (see Note C3).Insert the sampler into the cooling chamber. The measurement will take approximately 1 min. When the measurement has been completed, pull out the sampler, and remove and discard the sampler tip (see Note C4).Dry the sampler plunger wire with a Kimwipe.Clean the cooling chamber with a chamber cleaner as per the manufacturer’s instructionsRepeat steps C2 a-f two more times.Check for any residue at the bottom of your serum sample. Should residue be present, centrifuge the sample again at 6,000 x g for 2.5 min, and pipette the serum into a fresh microcentrifuge tube.Vortex the sample for 5 sec. Measure the serum osmolality using the same technique described in step C2, briefly vortexing (~3 sec) the serum in between each measurement (see Notes C1 and C2).Attach a sampler tip to the sampler. Use the sampler to draw 20 μl of the serum sample.Wipe the outside of the sampler tip dry with a Kimwipe, including the tip perimeter. Blot excess sample so that the meniscus is in line with the tip or slightly concave (see Note C3).Insert the sampler into the cooling chamber.",
    "The measurement will take approximately 1 min. When the measurement has been completed, pull out the sampler, and remove and discard the sampler tip.Dry the sampler plunger wire with a Kimwipe.Clean the cooling chamber with a chamber cleaner as per the manufacturer’s instructions.Repeat steps C5 a-f two more times (see Note C5).When all measurements have been completed, clean the cooling chamber as per the manufacturer’s guidelines.Report the final value as an average of all serum osmolality measurements."
