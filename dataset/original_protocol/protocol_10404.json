    "Ethical approval for the trial was obtained from the ethics committee of Hadassah Medical Center, Ein Kerem, Jerusalem (0306-17-HMO, MOH 2017-10-31_00073 4).\n1. Study design\nSet the target for recruitment at 60 participants and divide the participants into two groups for a 3 month program.\n\tNOTE: Power analysis to demonstrate a difference of 2,000 steps/day in intervention vs. nonintervention patients, with a standard deviation of 2,500 steps/day, at 80% power and .05 probability, requires 50 participants. In order to accommodate potential dropouts, five more participants will be recruited in each group.\nEnsure that the participants are adults above the age of 21, with a diagnosis of ischemic heart disease (acute coronary syndrome with or without revascularization). Note that eligible candidates must be clinically stable ambulatory patients who are able to perform physical exercises.\nExclude the participants with any serious or terminal illness that would preclude CR eligibilityNew York Heart Association Functional Classification (NYHA) above 2 as determined by the assessing cardiologist at the time of the intake. Also exclude patients planning to leave the geographic locale or those who participate in another randomized controlled trials (RCT), and patients who are incapable of using the technology prescribed or do not have a Bluetooth/standardapplication programming interface (API, Apple, Android).\nPerform baseline assessment after informed consent and prior to the start of CR.\nRandomly assign the participants by lottery (sealed envelope method) to the different interventions, namely facility CR or home CR (HCR).",
    "Derive study variables from measurements and questionnaires obtained pre- and post-intervention. Assess measurements at four time points (baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months) and compare the variables between intervention and control groups. Calculate between-group comparisons for continuous variables using an unpaired t-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test, while categorical variables can be compared using a chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test for small numbers.\nConduct within-group comparisons of variables at the four time points using a paired t-test for continuous variables and McNemar's test for categorical variables. Perform all statistical analysis using SPSS.\n2. Preparation and end of the study\nDo clinical tests and anthropometric measurements. Measure the height, weight, waist circumference, visceral fat and BMI, blood pressure, and HbA1c and lipid profile of the patient.\nComplete a sociodemographic survey (SF-36).\nPerform a graded exercise ECG stress test using the Bruce protocol.\nDesign individualized exercise programs.\nAssess the exercise intensity per patient with the heart rate reserve method.\nComplete a survey regarding the benefits and usability of the smart digital garment at the end of the study.\n3. Patients entering outpatient CR\nFacility-based participants\nLet the facility-based participants attend the facility twice/week for 1 h over a 3 month period.\nAsk the participants to exercise at home, as per the guidelines, for at least 150 min of exercise per week at 60% of their target heart rate, with a preference for daily exercise.\nHCR participants\nFor the first 6 weeks, let HCR participants attend the facility twice/week for 1 h, wearing the wristband (at all times) and the smart digital garment (at predetermined times).\nTell the participants that they should perform monitored exercise at their individual capacity for 5 days a week, following instructions found in the app.\nProvide support and assistance regarding interventions and the achievement of goals.",
    "For the next 6 weeks, ask the participants to perform monitored exercise following instructions found in the app and ensure that they exercise at their individual capacity for 5 days a week.\n4. Exercise procedure\nFacility-based training protocol\nCombine resistance and aerobic exercises in each training session.\nMeasure the patient's blood pressure 3x, namely before, during, and at the end of each exercise session.\nHave the participant warm up for 5 min.\nAerobic exercises for 30 min.\nHave the participant bike for 10 min.\nHave the participant walk on the treadmill for 15 min.\nHave the participant paddle on a hand cycle for 5 min.\nHave the participant perform resistance training at seven interval stations with active rest: rowing, chest press, leg press, shoulder press, leg extension, lateral pull down, and leg flexion. Each exercise consists of one set of 15 repetitions.\nHave the participant gradually cool down for 5 min.\nMonitor the heart rate using ECG telemetry.\nMake the training progressively more intense by increasing it from light (30% of 1-repetition maximum [1RM]) to 50% of 1RM.\nHome-based training protocol\nLet the participant attend the CR facility biweekly for the first 6 weeks and encourage them to perform monitored exercises 5 days a week at home.\nProvide the wearable wristband and the smart digital garment to the participant. While the participant is at the facility, have face-to-face sessions for the introduction of the equipment and instructions on how to use it.\nAsk the participant to wear the wristband at all time and the smart digital garment at predetermined times.\nTransfer ECG measurements before, during, and after the patient walks on the treadmill.",
    "Have the participant work out at home according to the instructions given in the app or digitally via chat or face to face by the coordinator. Provide support and assistance regarding interventions and the achievement of goals.\nFor the remaining 6 weeks, let the participant exercise only at home.\nTell the participant to wear the smart garment twice a week, and transfer ECG measurements before, during, and after performing proactive walking.\nHave the participant send manual blood pressure measurements via the app, taken before and after performing proactive walking.\nConfirm that the participant has taken his medications daily."
