    "1. Polymer Synthesis\nIn a fume hood, weigh out 3,523 mg of butanediol diacrylate (C) and transfer to a glass scintillation vial containing a stir bar.\nPre-heat 5-amino-1-pentanol (32) to 90 °C to solubilize the salt, then in a fume hood, weigh out 1,533 mg 32 and add to the scintillation vial containing C. This method will result in a molar ratio of C:32 = 1:1.2.\nImmediately place the vial containing both solutions onto a stir plate. Set stir speed at 600 rpm.\nTransfer the scintillation vial to an oven set at 90 °C. Set stirring speed to 1,000 rpm for 4 hr. If the stir bar gets stuck, lower the speed. After 4 hr, lower speed to 300 rpm and maintain at 90 °C for another 12-16 hr.\nAdd 5 g of C32 to 10 ml of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) in a glass scintillation vial containing a stir bar. Wrap in foil and vortex on high until fully dissolved.\nIn a separate glass scintillation vial containing a stir bar, add 10 mM of Tetraethyleneglycoldiamine (122). Add 40 ml of THF.\nPlace both vials (C32 and 122) on a stir plate for 5 min then combine together. Cover in foil and leave at room temperature stirring at 400 rpm for 24 hr. The final product is termed C32-122.\nWeigh out 5 x 50 ml Falcon tubes for each 5 g batch of C32-122. Note the mass of each tube in a notebook.\nTransfer 30 ml of anhydrous diethyl ether to each 50 ml Falcon tube.\nTransfer 10 ml of C32-122 to each 50 ml Falcon tube.\nVortex Falcon tubes vigorously then centrifuge at 2,500 rpm for 2 min. Note: The extracted polymer will collect at the base of the tube.",
    "Discard the upper solution and repeat steps 1.9 and 1.11 two more times.\nPlace the open tubes containing the extracted C32-122 in the desiccator and vacuum overnight. Ensure all tubes are protected from light.\nWeigh all tubes containing C32-122 to determine the final mass of the extracted polymer.\nDissolve the extracted polymer in anhydrous DMSO at a concentration of 100 mg/ml.\nStore the dissolved polymer at -20 °C protected from light and moisture.\n2. Cell Seeding\nPre-coat the base of a T-150 tissue culture flask with 0.1% (wt/vol) gelatin. The gelatin should remain in the flask for 30-45 min. The gelatin coating helps adhesion of ADSCs.\nAspirate gelatin from the pre-coated T-150 flask.\nAdd 4 x 106 ADSCs (≤ passage 3) to the flask in 20 ml of DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin and 10 ng/ml bFGF.\nPlace the T-150 flask in the incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight.\nBegin transfection procedure the following day.\n3. Nanoparticle Preparation and Transfection\nThe following procedure is for the preparation of nanoparticles containing 16.1 μg plasmid DNA per 1.0 x 106 cells at a polymer to plasmid weight ratio of 30:1.\nDilute plasmid DNA (1 mg/ml, pVEGF165, Aldevron, ND, USA) to a final concentration of 120 μg/ml in sodium acetate (25 mM) in a 15 ml Falcon tube.\nDilute C32-122 (100 mg/ml) to a final concentration of 3.6 mg/ml in sodium acetate (25 mM) in a second 15 ml Falcon tube.\nCombine the contents of each Falcon tubes into a single 15 ml falcon tube and vortex immediately on high for 10 sec.\nLet the tube sit at room temperature for 10 min for nanoparticle formation to occur.\nWhile incubating, replace medium in tissue culture flask with 7.8 ml fully supplemented DMEM per 1.0 x 106 cells transfected.",
    "Transfer the nanoparticle solution to the tissue culture flask and tilt forward and backwards to spread evenly.\nPlace the tissue culture flask in the incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 4 hr.\nAfter 2 hr, replace the nanoparticle containing media with DMEM.\nFollowing a further 2 hr incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2, the cells are ready for in vivo injection.\n4. Hindlimb Ischemia Procedure\nAll experiments were performed in accordance with the Stanford University Animal Care and Use Committee Guidelines and approved APLAC protocols. Generating the murine model of hindlimb ischemia is performed as previously described.8 Please refer to the reference for detailed instructions. A short description is provided below.\nPlace the mouse under anesthesia with 1-3% dosage isoflurane by inhalation and oxygen flow rate of 1 L/min. Ensure anesthetic depth by toe pinch, reduction in respiratory rate, and lethargy.\nRemove hair from the abdominal region and both hindlimb areas of the mouse with shaving cream.\nMake incision at center of medial thigh towards midline and then cut through overlying fat pad to expose the femoral artery.\nLigate the artery at two sites: distal site (close to the knee) and proximal site (just distal to the inguinal ligament).\nTo create the ligations, separate the artery from the vein and thread a 5-0 silk suture around the artery. Tie off the artery with two knots to make the ligation.\nRemove the artery between the two ligation points.\nWash the surgical area with PBS and then suture the incision closed.",
    "The anesthesia can now be removed. Keep the mouse warm until re-awakening. For post-operative care, 2-4 mg/kg Lidocaine can be injected subcutaneously at the incision site prior to re-awakening. Further pain management may include subcutaneous delivery of 0.05-0.1 mg/kg Buprenorphine at 12 and 24 hr. Monitor the health status of the mice once a day for seven days by observing changes in breathing pattern, overt pain or distress, and skin color.\nConfirm hindlimb ischemia by laser Doppler perfusion imaging.\n5. Cell Injections\nWhen the transfected cells and the mice are ready, wash transfected cells with PBS, trypsinize, centrifuge, and then count.\nResuspend cells at a density of 10 x 106 cells per ml in PBS.\nCell suspensions should be separated into separate Eppendorf tubes at a volume of 110 μl. This will ensure that each mouse receives an equal amount of cells.\nPlace each mouse under anesthesia (2.5% isoflurane, 1 L/min oxygen flow rate).\nClean the injection site with alcohol wipes.\nUtilizing a 27 G tuberculin syringe, draw the cells up and down into the syringe to ensure a homogeneous suspension is achieved. Draw up 100 μl of the cell suspension volume into the syringe.\nInject half the cell suspension into the adductor muscle region and then inject the other half into the calf muscle region. Upon injecting, leave the syringe in place for at least 15-30 sec to prevent leakage of the cell suspension.\nProper controls for the animal study include: 1) cells transfected with a non-coding plasmid (e.g. plasmid with no biological activity); 2) cells alone; and 3) PBS.\nWhen injections are complete, remove the mouse from anesthesia and keep warm until the mouse re-awakes.\n6. Bioluminescence Imaging\nTo begin bioluminescence imaging (BLI), anesthetize mice as described above.\nClean the injection site with alcohol wipes.",
    "Utilizing insulin syringe, load 100 μl of 15 mg/ml D-luciferin (the substrate for firefly luciferase). Keep substrate away from light.\nTo perform intraperitoneal injections, hold mice by the skin of their back to pull their anterior skin taut. Insert needle intraperitoneally into the abdominal region and inject 100 μl of substrate.\nPlace the mouse in the IVIS luciferase imaging chamber under anesthesia.\nImage the mice with an exposure time of 1.0 min. When parameters are set, begin to acquire images.\nWhen the image is acquired, mark the region of interest to measure the luciferase signal. In this case, mark the ischemic limb at the cell-injection site.\nContinue to measure the luciferase signal every 3-5 min until the signal reaches a peak and begins to decline. This is the value utilized for comparison across mice and over several time points.\nWhen complete, remove the mice from the chamber and anesthesia. Keep mice warm until re-awakening.\n7. Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging\nLaser Doppler perfusion imaging is performed as previously described.8 The procedure is briefly described here.\nPrior to Doppler imaging the mouse should be cleanly shaven at the areas overlying both hindlimbs and the abdominal region to prevent artifact due to hair.\nWhen prepared to Doppler image, the mouse should be anesthetized as described above.\nWarm the mouse to 36 °C on a hot plate while monitoring body temperature by rectal thermometer.\nPlace the mouse on a non-reflective black surface and keep anesthetized by nose cone. The mouse should be placed on its dorsal surface with its limbs exposed evenly.\nPosition the laser Doppler sensor roughly 15 cm above the mouse and directing the laser pointer from the sensor towards the groin region of the mouse.",
    "When the mouse and the Doppler sensor are in position, images can be taken utilizing the LDPIwin software by pressing the Start button.\nRelative perfusion measurements could be taken by indicating both hindlimbs (ischemic and non-ischemic) as region of interests (ROI). The ratio of mean perfusion of the ischemic to the non-ischemic hindlimb will indicate relative perfusion.\n8. Tissue Harvest Procedure\nWhen prepared to harvest mouse tissue for histology and/or biochemical processing, the mouse should be euthanized. Here, the mouse is euthanized by exposing to 5% isoflurane for 3-5 min, then euthanizing the mouse by cervical dislocation.\nCut the overlying skin surrounding the hindlimb circumferentially at the distal abdominal region and proximal to the hindlimb. The skin is cut from the ventral to the dorsal surfaces, such that the skin can be pulled back over the hindlimb to the foot.\nUpon pulling the skin back, the limb could be amputated by utilizing blunt dissection scissors to cut at the pelvic and femur joint.\nTwo main tissues are taken for analysis: the medial adductor muscles and the gastrocnemius muscles.\nFor histology, embed one or both tissues in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) for cryosectioning.\nFor biochemical analysis, collect one or both tissues into an 1.5 ml Eppendorf and submerge into a bath of liquid nitrogen for at least 2 min. The samples can be stored at -80 °C for future processing.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
