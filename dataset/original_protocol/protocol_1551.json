    "Step-By-Step Method Details\nStep-By-Step Method Details\nInsertion of sgRNAs into Vector\nTiming: 5 days\nDay 1. Vector Digestion using BsaI\nSet up the following reaction using vector of choice (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D and 1E):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_112_4.csv\nDigest 16 h (overnight) at 37°C.\nDay 2. Part One – Purification of cut vector\nAdd 2 μL of Quick CIP and allow reaction to go for 30 min at 37°C.\nRun the cut vector on a 1% agarose gel and perform a gel extraction using the Qiagen gel extraction kit following manufacturer instructions.\nNote: The linear vector should run at ∼7.8 kb.\nDay 2. Part Two – Anneal and phosphorylate each pair of oligos\nNote: Part Two can be completed simultaneously with Part One.\nCombine the following reagents:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_112_5.csv\nIncubate for 30 min at 37°C.\nBoil the reaction at 100°C for 5 min.\nTurn off the heat and allow the reaction to slowly reach 20°C–22°C (room temperature).\nAlternatives: This can also be completed using a ramp down protocol in a thermocycler.\nDay 2. Part Three – Ligate the phosphorylated and annealed oligos into the cut vector\nAdd 1 μL T4 ligase and ∼50 ng of cut vector directly to the reaction from Part Two.\nAllow the ligation to sit at 20°C–22°C (room temperature) for 3 h.\nRemove excess salts via dialysis.\nTransform 1.5 μL of the ligation using 25 μL DH10B electrocompetent E. coli cells.\nAfter transformation, quickly resuspend in 500 μL LB.\nAllow 1-h recovery in 37°C with shaking and then plate 100 μL on LB + 100 μg/mL AMP antibiotic plates.\nAllow the colonies to grow 12–16 h at 37°C.\nPause Point: Plate may be stored at 4°C for multiple days.\nDay 3. Colony selection and miniprep setup",
    "Set up eight minipreps using 3 mL LB + 100 μg/mL AMP in 14 mL tubes that allow aeration.\nPlace in 37°C with 250 rpm shaking for 12–16 h.\nDay 4. DNA purification and validation of sgRNA insertion\nPerform a miniprep of each of the colonies using the Qiagen miniprep kit to extract the plasmid DNA according to manufacturer instructions.\nPrepare the following reaction for each purified colony DNA:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_112_6.csv\nLet each reaction go 3–4 h at 37°C.\nRun a 1% gel to determine if the oligos inserted.\nNote: Insertion of the sgRNA into the vector will produce a single band at 7.8 kb. Failure to insert the sgRNA will result in two bands (2.5 kb and 5.3 kb).\nSelect a colony and add 200 μL from miniprep culture in 200 mL LB + 100 μg/mL AMP in a 1L Erlenmeyer flask. Incubate 16 h (overnight) at 37°C with 250 rpm.\nDay 5. Purification of plasmid DNA\nPerform a maxiprep using the Invitrogen maxiprep kit.\nSend the DNA to Genewiz for sequencing using the U6 Genewiz Universal primer (sequence: GACTATCATATGCTTACCGT).\nPause Point: The product can be stored at −20°C for years.\nViral Package, Injection, and Expression\nTiming: >7 weeks\nPackage plasmids into AAVs.\nNote: For packaging DNA into AAVs, please refer to (Gore et al., 2013[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) for step by step instructions or use a commercial AAV packaging facility.\nCritical: AAV serotypes and titer for AAV-FLEX-SaCas9-sgRNA and AAV-FLEX-EGFP-KASH or AAV-FLEXfrt-SaCas9-sgRNA and AAV-FLEXfrt-EGFP-KASH must be the same to maximize co-transduction efficiencies.\nCo-inject Cre- or Flp-expressing animals with newly synthesized AAV-FLEX-SaCas9-sgRNA or AAV-FLEXfrt-SaCas9-sgRNA (targeting your gene of choice) and AAV-FLEX-EGFP-KASH or AAV-FLEXfrt-EGFP-KASH, respectively (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/112-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Process for the Validation of sgRNAs In Vivo\n(A) Schematic of AAV co-injections into the mouse brain.",
    "(B) Schematic of workflow necessary to prepare nuclei for FACS.\n(C) Left: Schematic of proper gating to isolate GFP-negative and GFP-positive nuclei. Right: Example FACS with GFP-negative and GFP-positive gates labeled.\n(D) Schematic of workflow for the generation and sequencing of amplicons following FACS. Red arrow: SaCas9 cleavage site.\nNote: KASH is a protein domain that is inserted into the nuclear envelope. EGFP-KASH integrates EGFP into the nuclear envelope to appropriately identify virally transduced nuclei by EGFP fluorescence (Swiech et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]).\nCritical: Viral concentrations should be between 1 and 3 × 1012 particles per mL and injected at a volume of 0.5 mL and rate of 0.25 mL/min. AAV-FLEX-SaCas9-sgRNA and AAV-FLEX-EGFP-KASH should be mixed at equal ratios. Optimal injection volumes, ratios, and viral titers should be tested to ensure optimal expression for each targeted cell type and brain region.\nCritical: Allow 4 weeks minimum post-surgery for viral expression, and SaCas9 targeting and genomic DNA cleavage before beginning the next section.\nValidation of sgRNA\nTiming: 2 days\nDay 1. Part One – Homogenize tissue and isolate nuclei\nTiming: 1–1.5 h\nAt 4 weeks (or longer) following viral injection, harvest tissues from the injected animals. If harvesting from a localized brain region, slice brain into relatively thin (approx. 500 μm) coronal slices using a precision mouse brain slicer and biopsy punch. 3–6 tissue punches weighing <2 mg each can be combined into a single reaction.\nPlace 2 mL of cold homogenization buffer in a 2 mL Dounce homogenizer. Keep everything on ice.\nExtract the tissue containing the virus injection using a small Biopsy punch.\nNote: If there is a large amount of tissue, simply divide the tissue into multiple reactions. Too much tissue inhibits efficient homogenization.",
    "Note: Tissue from the same region with no viral manipulations is a good negative control for setting gates for FACS. See step 11c for additional instruction.\nPause Point: Tissue may be flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.\nPlace the tissue directly into 2 mL of homogenization buffer (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nHomogenize the brain slices first by using Dounce A 25x. Then switch to Dounce B 25x.\nPipette this into a 15 mL conical tube on ice.\nAdd 3 mL of homogenization buffer to bring the volume to 5 mL. Keep on ice for 5 min.\nAdd 5 mL of Upper gradient centrifugation buffer and mix by inversion.\nGently load on top of 10 mL of the lower gradient centrifugation buffer into 1 × 3½ Beckman tubes.\nCentrifuge at 7,150 × g for 30 min at 4°C.\nRemove the suspended debris using a KimWipe and then gently decant the supernatant.\nResuspend in 500–1,000 μL sterile 1× PBS.\nDay 1. Part Two – FACS using a BD AriaFACS III\nTiming: 1 h\nPlace 3 μL of REPLI-g Advanced Single Cell Storage buffer (Qiagen) into each well of an 8-well PCR strip. Keep everything on ice.\nSort using the 70 μm nozzle in single cell mode on a BD AriaFACS III. Sort 500 nuclei per well, which results in 1 μL of sorted cell suspension per well.\nDesign gates by comparing the negative control (no viral manipulations) to the experimental group. The GFP-positive gate should contain no GFP-negative nuclei as determined by the negative control (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C). Load the negative control and position the GFP-positive gate such that it contains zero GFP-negative nuclei.\nSort both GFP-positive and GFP-negative nuclei.\nAfter the sort, keep the samples on ice.",
    "Pause Point: Samples may be frozen at −80°C or used directly for whole genome amplification (WGA).\nDay 1. Part Three – Whole genome amplification\nTiming: 2.5 h\nPerform whole genome amplification (WGA) using the REPLI-g Advanced Single Cell kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).\nNote: WGA is used to limit bias during PCR amplification.\nDilute 2 μL of WGA FACS DNA into 100 μL of H2O (1:50) and store at 4°C.\nPause Point: 1:50 WGA FACS DNA can be stored at 4°C, and the remaining WGA FACS DNA at −20°C for long-term storage.\nDay 2 (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D). Amplification of target region\nTiming: 4 h\nSet up the following reaction on ice (PCR 1) using the Phusion high-fidelity DNA polymerase kit and first set of PCR primers:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_112_7.csv\nMix well, then divide the 100 μL reaction into four 25 μL reactions.\nUse the following thermocycler protocol:\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_112_8.csv\nNote: Please refer to potential problems 3–5 in the Troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section to alter thermocycler protocol accordingly.\nCombine the four reactions from PCR 1 into a single tube and mix well.\nSet up the following reaction (PCR 2):\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_112_9.csv\nMix well, then divide the 100 μL reaction into four 25 μL reactions.\nUse the exact same thermocycler protocol from step 13c.\nCombine the four reactions from PCR 2 into a single tube and mix well.\nRun the product on a 2% agarose gel.\nGel extract the final product (single band between 200–400 bp) using the MinElute gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Final product may be sent directly to sequencing or may be kept at 20°C for long-term storage.\nAmplicon-EZ submission\nPlease refer to Genewiz: Amplicon-EZ service for exact submission guidelines.\nNecessary items:\nReference sequence of amplicon\nPCR 2 forward and reverse primers sequence\n500 ng (20 ng/μL) of amplicons"
