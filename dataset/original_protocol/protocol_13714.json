    "This study got approval from the Institutional Review Board of Asan Medical Center (IRB number: 2021-0101).\n1. Pretransplant preparation\nPatient selection\n\t\nInclude patients with end-stage renal disease who require kidney transplantation.\n\t\tNOTE: RAKT may not be considered if a recipient is younger than eighteen years old.\nExclude those with any kind of untreated malignancy or active infection.\nEnsure that the recipient is suitable for surgery with respect to cardiac and pulmonary function and appropriate for a minimally invasive approach.\nDo not consider RAKT if a patient has a history of major abdominal surgery or severe intraperitoneal adhesion. In addition, do not consider RAKT and recommend open kidney transplantation if there is severe calcification in the iliac arteries on computerized tomography.\nPatient preparation\nBegin the standard presurgical preparation. Administer laxative suppository tablets for bowel preparation. Ensure that the patient does not ingest anything orally from midnight of the day of the operation. Administer prophylactic first-generation cephalosporin just before a skin incision.\nProvide the maintenance immunosuppressants (e.g., calcineurin inhibitors, methylprednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil) from two days (conventional cases) or seven days (ABO-incompatible or human leukocyte antigen-incompatible cases) before the transplantation according to the protocol of the respective center.\nPrepare the induction immunosuppressants (i.e., anti-thymocyte globulin or basiliximab) that will be administered during the RAKT.\nEquipment\nEnsure the availability of a robotic system.\nEnsure the availability of standard laparoscopic equipment and robotic instruments (see the Table of Materials).\nEnsure the availability of 6/0 or 7/0 polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) sutures for artery and vein anastomosis.\nEnsure the availability of 6/0 polydioxanone suture and 3/0 polyglactin adsorbable suture for neocystoureterostomy.\nEnsure the availability of a double-J stent.\n2. Surgical preparation\nAnesthesia\n\t\nEvaluate the operative risk according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists' classification of Physical Health.\nInduce general anesthesia and use rocuronium bromide as a muscle-relaxant.",
    "Insert a central venous line and an arterial line.\nInsert a foley catheter and fill the bladder with normal saline. Keep the foley catheter clamped until ureteroneocystostomy is performed.\nPerform arterial blood gas analyses at 1 h intervals during the transplantation.\nReverse the anesthesia with sugammadex (2 mg/kg, intravenous) at the end of the surgery.\nOperation field\n\tNOTE: A schematic arrangement map of the operating room is shown in Figure 1.\n\t\nHave the operator perform procedures from the robotic console.\nHave the first assistant stand on the left side of the patient.\n\t\tNOTE: The first assistant will be in charge of performing irrigation and suction, supplying sutures and bulldog clamps, and helping with retraction.\nHave the second assistant stand on the right side of the patient's hip to exchange robotic instruments and help the first assistant.\nHave a scrub nurse stand on the left side of the patient's left leg.\nPlace the patient in the left lateral decubitus position with the legs parted and the Trendelenburg position (20°-30°). Dock the robot between the legs.\nPreparation of the kidney allograft (Figure 2)\n\t\nEnsure that cold ischemia is started immediately after recovering the kidney from the living donor. Remove the perinephric fat tissue and perform meticulous ligation of the lymphatics around the hilum of kidney allograft on a back table.\nMeasure the weight and size of the kidney allograft.\nConsider arterial reconstruction if there are multiple renal arteries such as side-to-side anastomosis, end-to-side anastomosis of the polar artery into the main renal artery, and polar artery anastomosis to the inferior epigastric artery.\nConsider venous extension with a gonadal vein of the recipient or an iliac vein of the deceased donor.\nInsert a 4.8-French, 12 cm double-J stent in the ureter using a guide-wire.\nWrap the kidney allograft in an ice-packed gauze.",
    "3. Positioning of the robotic and gel ports ( Figure 3)\nEstablish and maintain a pneumoperitoneum at approximately 10 mmHg.\n\tNOTE: Trocar positioning is for right-sided kidney transplantation.\nIntroduce the 12 mm or 8 mm robotic camera port just above the umbilicus.\n\tNOTE: The camera port should be placed at about 10-15 cm from the nearest boundary of the target anatomy.\nPlace the 8 mm robotic port for Arm II on the right lateral side at 8-9 cm away from the camera port.\nPlace another 8 mm robotic port for Arm III along the line between the umbilicus and anterior superior iliac spine at a distance of approximately 8-9 cm from the umbilicus.\nPlace the other 8 mm robotic port for Arm IV at approximately 8-9 cm laterally to the port for Arm III.\n\tNOTE: Ensure a distance of 2 cm between the ports and bony prominences.\nPlace the gel port (6 cm Pfannenstiel incision) on the right suprapubic area (the target anatomy). Make two or three ports on the gel port for the first and second assistants.\n4. Intraabdominal dissection and insertion of the kidney allograft (Video 1)\nIncise the peritoneum along the right paracolic gutter to make a pouch for the kidney allograft with monopolar curved scissors (Arm II), fenestrated bipolar forceps (Arm III), and Prograsp forceps (Arm IV) (see the Table of Materials).\nDissect the right external iliac vessels along their entire length. Encircle each vessel with a vessel loop.\nDissect the bladder for ureteroneocystostomy on the right corner of the bladder and separate it from the peritoneal incision for the kidney allograft.\nAfter opening a cap of the gel port, insert slushed ice followed by the kidney allograft wrapped in the ice-packed gauze through the 6 cm Pfannenstiel incision.",
    "Place the allograft on the peritoneal pouch lateral to the iliac vessels on the right side.\n5. Vascular anastomosis and reperfusion (Video 1)\nKeep the allograft as cold as possible with either slushed ice or cold normal saline.\nClamp the right external iliac vein distal and proximal to the anastomosis site with Bulldog clamps, manipulated by Prograsp forceps (Arm IV).\nMake a venotomy with Potts scissors in a linear or oblique fashion, considering the diameter of the renal vein.\nAnastomose the allograft renal vein to the right external iliac vein in an end-to-side continuous manner using a 6/0 ePTFE suture. Make a knot at the caudal end of veins, and suture the posterior wall intraluminally in a continuous manner. Afterwards, suture the anterior wall in a continuous manner.\n\tNOTE: The anastomosis is performed with a large needle driver on Arm II and black diamond microforceps or Maryland forceps on Arm III for right-handed surgeons.\nFlush the lumen with heparinized normal saline (5 IU/mL) just before knotting the anastomosis using a silastic tube through the gel port.\nClamp the allograft renal vein with a Bulldog clamp.\nDeclamp the right external iliac vein.\nClamp the right external iliac artery proximal and distal to the anastomosis site with Bulldog clamps.\nMake an arteriotomy with Potts scissors. Create a round hole with Potts scissors and without an arterial punch.\nUsing the same method as vein anastomosis, anastomose the allograft renal artery to the right external iliac artery in an end-to-side continuous manner using a 6/0 ePTFE suture.\nFlush the lumen with heparinized normal saline just before knotting the anastomosis using a silastic tube through the gel port.\nClamp the allograft renal artery with a Bulldog clamp.\nDeclamp the right external iliac artery.",
    "Declamp the allograft renal vein and artery if there is no evident bleeding at the anastomosis sites.\nRemove the ice-packed gauze.\nApply warm normal saline on the allograft with an irrigation tube through the gel port.\n6. Ureteroneocystostomy and peritoneal covering (Video 1)\nPerform ureteroneocystostomy according to the Lich-Gregoir technique11.\nPut the distal end of the double-J stent into the bladder.\nStarting at the posterior corner, perform a continuous suture using a 6/0 polydioxanone suture and make a knot at the anterior corner. Then, perform a continuous suture from the anterior corner to the posterior corner.\nFrom the anterior corner to the posterior corner, close the detrusor muscle antireflux tunnel in an interrupted manner using a 4/0 polyglactin multifilament absorbable suture.\nCover the kidney allograft with the incised peritoneum along the right paracolic gutter intermittently using polymer locking clips.\n7. Wound closure\nInsert a closed-suction drain through the 8 mm robotic port for Arm II on the right lateral side and put the drain around the kidney allograft.\nDeflate the pneumoperitoneum by opening the gel port.\nClose the gel port and the camera port incisions layer by layer (peritoneum, muscles, subcutaneous layer, and skin). Close the 8 mm robotic port incisions only at the level of the subcutaneous layer and skin.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
