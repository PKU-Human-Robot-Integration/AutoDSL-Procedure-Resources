    "1. Building the Langendorff Apparatus (See Figure 1)\nUsing 3/8” tubing, connect the heart reservoir to the blood reservoir.\n\t\nEnsure that this tubing goes through a roller pump. NOTE: This may require using two 3/8” to 1/4\" tubing connectors to create a piece of 1/4\" tubing to go through the roller pump.\nConnect the blood reservoir to heater/oxygenator with 3/8” tubing.\nUse 3/8” tubing to connect the heater/oxygenator to a Y-connector.\nConnect one arm of Y-connector to the centrifugal pump, then connect the centrifugal pump to a second Y-connector (all with 3/8” tubing).\nAttach a piece 3/8” tubing securing a hemostasis valve to the upward-facing arm, which will serve as both a bubble trap and means of inserting the pressure transducer.\nAttach a piece of 3/8” tubing to the downward arm. This portion will attach to the aortic cannula (i.e. the afterload line).\nConnect the other arm of the Y-connector to the inflow of the pre-load chamber using 3/8” tubing. Ensure this tubing goes through a second roller pump. \nConnect excess 3/8” tubing to the outflow of this chamber. This portion will attach to the left atrium (i.e. the preload line).\nConnect the oxygen tank and heating apparatus to the heater/oxygenator.\nClamp the line going from the Y-connector to the pre-load chamber, as this line will not be used until the heart is put into working mode.\n2. Pressure-Volume Catheter Preparation\nIn a 37 °C water bath, warm a bottle of saline solution.\nSoak the PV conductance catheter and pressure transducer in the warm saline for at least 30 min.\nTurn on the data acquisition systems, allowing both to warm-up for at least 30 min.\n3. Preparing the Langendorff Apparatus",
    "Turn on the oxygen tank, heating apparatus, roller pump connecting the two reservoirs, and centrifugal pump. The heating apparatus should be set to the animal’s body temperature (~36 °C).\nWash the blood according to manufacturer’s instructions. Slower wash speeds are recommended for more complete removal of waste products from the blood (e.g., excess electrolytes, lysed cellular material).\nOnce the blood is washed, check hematocrit level prior to hemodilution.\nReconstitute the washed red blood cells with normal saline for desired hematocrit concentration (recommended: 20-25%) and add to the Langendorff apparatus.\nAdjust the speeds of the two pumps to begin blood flow through the system (excluding the preload chamber).\nCheck the pH and electrolytes of the blood mixture and adjust until physiologic for the species used. NOTE: To prevent deleterious influx of calcium upon reperfusion, the calcium levels on the Langendorff apparatus should initially be kept low (0.3-0.5 mmol/L).\n\t\nIf there is a decrease in the hematocrit with concurrent increase in potassium, check lactate dehydrogenase and plasma free hemoglobin to rule out hemolysis.\nIn case hemolysis does occur, ensure all connections are tight and there are no areas of obvious sheering.\nAttach the Millar catheter into the Secondary Pressure slot of the PowerLab system.\nCalibrate the pressure transducer according to manufacturer’s instructions.\n4. Preparing the Heart for Attachment to the Langendorff Apparatus",
    "NOTE: A properly arrested heart should be used for any large animal experiments involving an isolated heart system. Lack of cardioplegic arrest can damage the heart such that it will not produce measureable work. Celsior, or low-potassium University of Wisconsin (UW) solution is recommended, as not only are these solutions similar to those used clinically, but the low potassium of the solution helps prevents hyperkalemia while on the circuit. Volume of cardioplegic solution will depend on heart size, with 1 liter sufficient for porcine hearts.\nQuickly remove the heart from the storage container, pour out any storage solution in the ventricles, blot dry and weigh.\nTo help maintain a cold myocardial temperature until the heart is ready for the Langendorff, return the heart to storage container and orient it so that aorta is facing upwards.\nInsert an 3/8” cannula into the aorta and secure with a zip-tie.\n5. Attaching the Heart to the Langendorff\nDecrease the centrifugal pump to a slow trickle.\nTrickle the blood into the aorta until it is filled with blood and completely de-aired.\nCarefully attach the aortic cannula to the aortic tubing on the Langendorff. Make note of attachment time.\nInsert the calibrated pressure transducer through the hemostasis valve[DS1] into the native aorta.\nBegin pressure measurements and adjust centrifugal pump speed until desired reperfusion pressure is achieved. NOTE: Pressure may change as coronary resistance changes. Therefore, monitor aortic pressure closely, especially during initial reperfusion.\nIncrease temperature on warming unit intramyocardial temperature is measured at 37 °C. NOTE: There will be a delay between adjustments made to warming unit and changes in intramyocardial temperatures. Therefore, temperature changes should be made incrementally.\nObtain a baseline (T = 0) sample from the venous blood reservoir to measure pH, electrolytes, and other biochemical measurements.",
    "Insert temperature probe into septum and monitor myocardial temperature. Decrease temperature of warming unit if myocardial temperature rises above 39 °C.\nTake blood samples every 15 min, adjusting the physiologic parameters as desired for the experiment.\n\t\nAdd approximately 1 mmol of calcium to the blood solution every 5 min, ensuring that ionic calcium is > 0.8 mmol/L prior to the initiation of working mode.\n6. Putting the Heart into Working Mode\nInsert an appropriately sized cannula into the left atrium/pulmonary vein. This can be done with either a purse-string suture or zip-tie as appropriate.\nClose any holes in the left atrium that may leak, such as other pulmonary vein origins with suture or staples as needed.\nAdjust the height of the preload chamber such that the column height gives the desired preload pressure. NOTE: Assuming the density of blood/crystalloid mixture is equal to the density of water, 1 mmHg = 1.36 cm of the distance from the aortic valve to the top of the blood level in the preload reservoir (e.g., 15 mmHg = 20.4 cm).\nUnclamp the tubing going to the preload chamber and slowly start the preload roller pump, allowing the preload chamber and preload tubing to fill completely with blood.\nOnce the preload tubing is completely de-aired, slowly fill the left atrium and cannula with blood.\nWithout allowing any air to enter the system, connect the preload tubing to the left atrial cannula.\n7. Obtaining Ventricular Pressure-Volume (PV) Recordings\nFollow the manufacturer’s instructions for pressure and Rho cuvette calibration for the data acquisition systems.\nPlace a purse-string suture using a 3-0 polypropylene suture at the left ventricular (LV) apex.\nUsing a 16 G needle, make a stab incision within the purse-string.",
    "Insert the PV conductance catheter into the apical incision. NOTE: Ideal catheter placement will depend on having all sensing electrodes within the LV and two excitation electrodes outside the LV. Ensure that a properly sized animal and catheter have been selected (see Discussion).\nPress the “Start” button in the top right corner to begin recording data and determine how many volume segments are active.\n\t\nIf all segments are not active, adjust the catheter position until all segments are active. NOTE: Slight twisting of the catheter may be necessary to optimize loop morphology\nIf unable to obtain signals in all segments, adjust the location of excitation electrodes and sensing electrodes per manufacturer instructions.\nOnce the desired configuration is obtained, follow the manufacturer’s instructions for volume and alpha calibration.\nUsing a properly calibrated catheter, obtain at least 30 sec of baseline pressure-volume data. NOTE: These pressure-volume loops will provide volume dependent measurements of cardiac function (e.g., cardiac output, stroke volume).\n\t\nOnce sufficient loops are obtained, continue to the next step without stopping the data recording, so as to obtain occlusion pressure-volume data.\nOcclude the preload tube slowly using a tubing clamp. NOTE: The pressure-volume loops should begin to become smaller and shift down and to the left. This is called the “walk down”.\n\t\nObtain 10-15 sec of the walk down, then release the tubing clamp to allow for preload to reenter the left atrium. NOTE: These pressure-volume loops will provide volume independent measurements of cardiac function (e.g., preload recruitable stroke work, end systolic pressure-volume relationship).\nStop recording data by hitting the “Stop” button at the top right corner of the screen.\nWait at least 5 min before repeating the occlusion.\nRepeat steps 7.7 and 7.8 to obtain replicate measurements."
