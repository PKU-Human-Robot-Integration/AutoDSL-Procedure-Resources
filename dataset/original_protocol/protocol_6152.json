    "Isolation and culture of mouse neural stem cells (NSCs)Isolation of neural stem cells from E14.5 mouse brainDay 1 Prepare several 10 cm Petri dishes filled with Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS), place on ice. Euthanize an E14.5 timed-pregnant mouse with carbon dioxide following institutional animal protocols.Spray the abdomen with 70% ethanol to wet the fur and open the abdomen in Y-shape using standard dissection scissors and dressing forceps (Video 1).<p>imgsrc:https://bio-protocol.org/javascript:;</p> Video 1. Isolation of mouse cortices for NSC culture. (The University of Kansas Medical Center Animal Care and Use Committee approved all protocols performed (ACUP number:2016-2359, August 16, 2016-August 1, 2019).)Dissect out the connective tissues and vessels between the uterine horns, remove the uterus and place it on a 10 cm Petri dish filled with ice-cold HBSS.Use micro-scissors (Ted Pella) and tweezers (Ted Pella) to separate the embryos from the placenta, transfer the embryos to a new 10 cm Petri dish filled with ice-cold HBSS.Decapitate, remove skin and skull bones, and carefully collect embryonic brains under a dissecting microscope. Note: Place a 15 cm dish filled with ice under the 10 cm Petri dish to keep the embryos cold.  Remove the meninges and isolate the cortices, followed by dissecting the cortices into small pieces.Transfer the tissues to a 15 ml conical tube filled with ice-cold HBSS, centrifuge at 100 x g for 3 min at 4 °C.Remove supernatant, add ice-cold neural growth medium (NGM) (0.5 ml per brain), triturate with a 1 ml pipette, followed by incubation on ice for 2 min. Note: Gently pass through a 1 ml pipette for approximately 20 times and avoid bubble formation during trituration. Pass cell suspension through a 40 μm cell strainer to obtain single cells. Count the cells with a hemocytometer or cell/particle counter.",
    "Dilute single-cell suspension with NGM to a final concentration of 5 x 104 cells per ml with NGM.Culture 4 ml (5 x 104 cells per ml) of cells in each 6-well plate. Usually one embryo is sufficient to isolate around 106 total cells.Day 2 On the following day, discard the differentiated cells that have been attached to the bottom of the dish by transferring suspension cells to a new well.Days 3-6 Replace half medium with fresh NGM every other day for 4-5 days to allow neurosphere formation. Note: Cautiously remove the 6-well plate from the incubator to avoid disturbing the neurospheres that are settled at the bottom of the well. Remove 2 ml of medium using P1000 piptetman from the top of each well gently to avoid accidental suctioning of the neurospheres during this time. Discard removed medium and replenish the well with 2 ml fresh medium pre-warmed to 37 °C. Cells may be cryopreserved in NGM with 10% DMSO at this step. Subculturing of neurospheres when the spheres reach a size of 100-150 μm under a microscopeTransfer neurospheres with culturing medium to a 15 ml conical tube using serological pipet, centrifuge at 100 x g for 1 min. Remove supernatant.Resuspend neurospheres in 5 ml Dulbecco’s PBS (DPBS) without calcium and magnesium.Centrifuge at 100 x g for 1 min. Remove supernatant.Add 1 ml Accutase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at room temperature for 3-5 min, followed by gentle trituration using a 1 ml pipette until no large clumps are visible. Note: Gently pass through 1 ml pipette for approximately 20 times and avoid bubble formation. Add 5 ml NGM to neutralize Accutase, leave the tube on the stand for 5 min to allow remaining cell clumps to settle at the bottom, collect the solution that contains dissociated single cells for cell counting.",
    "Centrifuge at 200-300 x g for 4 min. Remove supernatant.Note: Cells may be cryopreserved in NGM with 10% DMSO at this step. Resuspend cells with NGM to a final concentration of 2-3 x 104 cells per ml. Transfer 4 ml of cell suspension into each well of a 6-well plate.Replace half medium with fresh NGM every other day as described in Step A1n, repeat the subculturing process when the spheres reach a size of 100-150 μm (typically in 3-4 days).Induction and culture of glial progenitor cellsCulture single-cell suspension 2-3 x 104 cells per ml from passages 2 to 6 of neurospheres in Oligosphere Medium (OM) to induce glial lineage differentiation. Note: We found that induction efficiency is higher when using single-cell suspension from neurospheres rather than using undissociated neurospheres. Avoid adding ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) to the medium to prevent astrocyte lineage differentiation.  Replace half medium every other day with fresh OM as described in Step A1n.Subculture spheres every 5-7 days for at least 12 days. The spheres should consist of > 95% glial progenitor cells at this time (Li et al., 2015).Setting up the in vitro migration assayPreparation of poly-L-ornithine (PLO)-coated glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek).Add 200 μl PLO solution (Sigma) to glass-bottomed dishes. Place the dishes in the tissue culture incubator at 37 °C for 1 h.Remove PLO solution, allow the dishes to dry at the tissue culture hood for 5-10 min.Rinse the dishes with sterile water twice. Note: PLO-coated glass-bottomed dishes can be stored at room temperature for 2 weeks. Seed cells onto the PLO-coated glass-bottomed dishes.Dilute mouse laminin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with sterile water to a final concentration of 2 μg per ml. Add 150 μl diluted laminin onto the glass-bottomed dishes.",
    "Place the dishes in the tissue culture incubator for 1 h, followed by removing laminin and rinsing the dishes with calcium- and magnesium-containing DPBS once in the tissue culture hood.Add 100 μl NGM at the bottom of the PLO/laminin-coated dishes.Carefully transfer 100-150 μm spheres using 10 μl pipette under the microscope to the PLO/laminin-coated glass-bottomed dishes. Note: We typically seed at least 8 spheres and image 6-8 spheres simultaneously. Allow the spheres to attach to the bottom of the dishes in the tissue culture incubator at 37 °C for 15 min, followed by carefully adding 2 ml pre-warmed NGM. Note: Avoid disturbing the spheres by adding NGM from the edge of the dish slowly.Microscope setup for time-lapse imagingNote: Here we demonstrate how to take time-lapse images using the Invitrogen EVOSTM FL Auto Imaging System with the EVOSTM Onstage Incubator. For detailed information regarding microscope installation and operation procedures, please refer to the EVOSTM user manual. Microscope setupTurn on the EVOSTM FL inverted microscope and the connected computer, select the appropriate stage holder, attach the environmental chamber to the microscope, followed by connecting the heated hose and the sensor cable to the environmental chamber. Add water to the “max fill” line in the water reservoir, and turn on the Onstage Incubator along with the air and CO2 tanks. Open the EVOSTM FL Auto software, set temperature at 37 °C, humidity > 80% and CO2 at 5%. Warm up for approximately 2 h. Note: To prevent water from accumulating around the objective, an empty dish/well should be used during system warm-up. Also, please ensure sufficient gas supply during the experiment. Live-cell imagingOpen the software. Choose the 10x objective and turn on the Trans light.Place a glass-bottomed dish with neurospheres attached to the bottom on the stage.",
    "Select 6-8 neurospheres with a similar size ranging between 100 and 150 μm by clicking “Add Beacon”. Note: Please make sure the dish is tightly sealed around the rim of the stage. Any space would allow water to evaporate, causing blurry images and damaging the objective. The duration of time-lapse image acquisition is approximately 2 h with a capturing interval of 2 min (for cells migrating on the surface coated with 20 μg per ml laminin). Note: For statistical analysis, we use images taken every 4 min during a 2-h period. Total imaging duration partly depends on the speed of cell migration. When the concentration of laminin is low (e.g., 0.5 μg per ml), cells migrate more slowly. Therefore, the duration and interval of time-lapse imaging should be adjusted accordingly."
