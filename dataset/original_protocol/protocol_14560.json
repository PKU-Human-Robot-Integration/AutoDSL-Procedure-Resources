    "The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Arizona. Participants provide their signed consent to participate.\n1. Recruit HIV-infected Participants\nRecruit HIV patients attending the Petersen clinic at Banner-University Medical Center Tucson Campus >50 years of age, able to walk without assistance for at least 15 feet and committed to attending training appointments for 30-60 min, twice a week, for six weeks.\nScreen the recruits for depression with the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) 27 questionnaire. (This is to gather a cohort representative of the more depressed HIV population subset.) If moderately or severely depressed (a score of >16 on the CES-D) ask the person to participate in the study.\n2. Assess the Frailty Status of the Participants by the method of Fried et al.28 with slight modifications for the HIV population29\nMeasure subjects for (1) Shrinking or unintentional weight loss; (2) Slowness or decreased gait speed; (3) Weakness as measured by grip strength; (4) Low physical activity level by calorie count; (5) and Exhaustion or depression by answering the CES-D questionnaire.27\nCollect demographic data pre-intervention along with questionnaires assessing fear of falling (FES-I: Short-Falls Efficacy Scale - International),30 and quality of life (Short-Form Health Survey, SF-1231), fall history, pain assessment using Visual Analogue Scale, activities of daily living (Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living32).\n3. Begin Training Intervention\nConduct Training Exercises for 3 -60 min Over a 6-week Period as Shown in Table 1.\n\t\nHave subjects perform all of the exercises and increase the difficulty of the exercises.\nAttach 5 inertial sensors to the subject's body that allow estimation of joint 3D angles in real-time33 and provide tri-axial accelerometer, gyroscopic and magnetometer data along with quaternion parameters.34,35 Attach sensors at the shanks, thighs and lower back using self- adhering straps.",
    "At Baseline, Measure the Subject's Balance and Gait. Also Measure Balance and Gait at the midpoint and Last Session.\n\t\nMeasure balance as Center of Mass (CoM) sway provided by feedback from the biosensors.\n\t\t\nHave the subject stand for 30 sec with feet in a double stance- first eyes open then repeated with eyes closed; followed by feet in semi-tandem stance â€“ eyes open and then closed.\nObserve the biosensor data and ask the subject to maintain eyesight straightforward at the wall during measurements.\nCollect balance measurements using the sensors placed at the ankles and the waist.35,36 Main balance outcomes included changes in CoM sway in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral direction measured with eyes open and eyes closed.\nEvaluate gait by having the subject perform a walk of 10 m. The trainer can observe the biosensor data but the subject cannot.\n\t\t\nCollect gait measurements for single task (a normal 10 m walk), dual task (10 m walk while performing cognitive task (counting backwards from a given number by 1) and fast walk (a fast-paced 10 m walk).\nAssess main gait outcomes for gait speed and variability as collected by sensors at the ankles and thighs.37,38\nAt the baseline and follow-up sessions, give the subject a shirt to wear for 48 hr with a monitor39,40 to gather normal physical activity data.\n\t\tNote: The exercises above improve balance in patients with peripheral neuropathy.24,41\nIn sessions 1-12, perform an ankle reaching task (Figure 1).\n\t\nExplain the exercise and then have the subject perform the ankle reaching task, which requires forward/backward/sideward/diagonal leaning and partial weight transfer of the subject while standing in front of the computer screen.",
    "Note: Data from shank-mounted sensors provide real-time visual feedback about 2D ankle trajectory. Rotations of the ankle joints are translated to a linear cursor on the computer screen (Figure 1). There are two circles on the screen, one is the starting circle and the other is the target circle (they are separated on the computer screen, one on the bottom and one on the top).\nHave the subject move the cursor (a dot on the screen which represents the subject) from the middle of the starting circle to the middle of the target circle. The cursor's position on the screen is determined by the biosensors so that by moving the ankle the cursor will move on the screen.\n\t\t\nHave the subject navigate the cursor from a start circle to a target circle by ankle joint rotation while standing with feet rooted in place. To move the cursor forward/backward, have the participant move the hip in the anterior-posterior direction to generate ankle dorsi-flexion or plantar-flexion. Medial-lateral hip movement navigates the cursor sideways. A task repetition in the opposite direction completes one cycle.\nHave the subject navigate rapidly (<1 sec) and accurately (in middle of the circle) from one circle to another. Corroborate correct execution by a visual cue (exploding of the target) and auditory cue (explosive sound) feedback. Use these cues as incentives for the subject to remain engaged in the exercise and perceive the improvement during the course of exercise.",
    "Transmit motor-error due to inaccuracy of navigating to and stopping at the center of the target circle in a timely manner to the subject via an audio-visual feedback at the end of the execution of each trial. A visual cue of a green circle in combination with an absence of noise is indicative of the correct action performed too slowly. Whereas a visual cue of a blue circle in combination with an absence of noise is indicative of the correct action performed faster than expected by the program.\nFor each session, perform 9 blocks with 20 cycles of ankle reaching.\n\t\t\nPerform blocks 1 + 4 + 7 in the anterior-posterior direction.\nPerform block 2 + 5 + 8 in a combined anterior-posterior and medial-lateral direction for a diagonal movement.\nPerform block 3 + 6 + 9 with a visuomotor rotation task42 to increase the motor and cognitive challenge. In this task, rotate the trajectory of the cursor by 20o. The subject observes this change in trajectory during the exercise and adjusts ankle coordination to navigate the cursor towards the target circle. Visuomotor rotation improves postural adaptation and postural calibration.37\nHave participants rest between blocks to avoid fatigue (30 to 60 sec).\nIn sessions 9-12, implement a more difficult ankle reaching exercise, the motor-cognitive ankle reaching exercise.\n\t\t\nIn these exercises, present 5 circles on the screen and label with either numbers or letters along with an origin \"home\" circle. Give the command to move the cursor from circle to circle in some order. For example, ask the subject to move the cursor from circle 1 to \"home\" to 2 to \"home\" to 3 and so on or some variation of this order requiring the subject to memorize the order of circles to move the cursor to.",
    "Note: This task is designed to enhance coordination between ankle, knee, and hip joints during weight shifting tasks.24,41\nIn sessions 2-12, perform an obstacle crossing task with increasing degrees of difficulty.\n\t\nIn sessions 2-7, utilize an obstacle crossing task with obstacles at 5% and 10% of height of subject. In sessions 9 - 12, add an additional obstacle crossing task with obstacles at 15% and 20% of the height of the subject.\nHave the subject face the computer screen where an avatar of the subject is present showing the hips and lower limbs. Have the subject watch the screen while performing this task.\nAfter an explanation, have the subject perform the obstacle crossing task (Figure 2). In this task the participant crosses virtual obstacles (boulders) moving on the computer screen from right to left. Real-time feedback is given using a stick figure avatar representing the participant's hip and knee movements. The avatar replicates lower limb movements including lifting the designated leg to an appropriate height to cross an obstacle.\nFor each session, include two or four series of obstacle crossings with ten repetitions each. To cognitively challenge participants, the program requires that they cross the obstacle alternatively with the left or the right leg. If the sequence of leg lifting is mistaken, the subject will be notified via audio-visual feedback. The next obstacle is released only after the participant either crosses or hit the previous obstacle and returns to double-stance for at least 2 sec (for safety).\nGive participants audio feedback at the end of each obstacle-crossing trial which indicated whether they successfully crossed the obstacle or not. They could hold on to a sturdy desk for support if required. However, after gaining confidence, encourage them to perform the exercises without support.",
    "Note: The virtual obstacle crossing task is designed to enhance perception of the position of the lower limbs, reduce reaction time and improve single leg balance.\n4. Trainer Measures and Records All Interventions\nCollect demographic data post-intervention along with questionnaires assessing fear of falling (FES-I: Short-Falls Efficacy Scale - International),30 and quality of life (Short-Form Health Survey, SF-1231), fall history, pain assessment using Visual Analogue Scale, activities of daily living (Barthel Index of Activities of Daily Living32), and depression with the CES-D questionnaire.27\n5. Remunerate Subject For Their Time\n6. Perform Statistical Analysis on All Subjects and Their Measured Responses to the Tasks\nUse paired samples student's t-tests and one-way ANOVA tests to compare patient's measurements at baseline and follow-up against themselves and within groups at follow-up (i.e. depressed/not depressed, pre-frail vs. non-frail, etc.), respectively. Report results as +/- SEM.\nPerform univariate linear regression analysis to explore hypothesized factors and outcomes in response to the training such as depression and frailty status with delta and baseline gait speed. Provide results with statistical significance of p <0.05, and coefficient of determination, R2, for the model fit."
