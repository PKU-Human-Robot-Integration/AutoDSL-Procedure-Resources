    "Preparation of M. smegmatis cultureStreak M. smegmatis frozen culture on a 7H10 agar plate and incubate aerobically at 37°C for 3 days until colonies are visible.Inoculate a single colony into 50 ml 7H9 medium in a 250-ml Erlenmeyer flask and incubate aerobically at 37°C for 16 h with shaking at 180 rpm (overnight culture).Collect cells from the overnight culture by centrifuging at 3,000 × g for 10 min. Wash the pellet twice with nitrogen-free MPLN medium and centrifuge as above. Resuspend the cells in 50 ml MPLN medium as the seeding culture.Re-inoculate 10 ml seeding culture into 1 L MPLN medium supplemented with 10 mM nitrate in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask and incubate aerobically at 37°C for 30 h with shaking to late-log phase (OD600 0.8–1.0).Preparation of M. smegmatis crude extractCollect cells by centrifuging at 5,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.Wash the cell pellet twice with 30 ml degassed 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5).Transfer the cell pellet into an anaerobic chamber and resuspend in 20 ml degassed 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) supplemented with 10% v/v glycerol and 1 mM PMSF.Disrupt cells by sonication (pulse: 0.3 s, stop: 0.7 s) for 10 min on ice and transfer the lysate to a centrifuge tube inside the anaerobic chamber.Centrifuge at 16,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C outside the anaerobic chamber.Bring the centrifuge tube back into the anaerobic chamber and collect the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) as the crude enzyme extract.Note: Keep on ice during the assay and use within 24 h. Determine the total protein concentration of the cytoplasmic fraction using the Bradford method.Preparation of the nitrite standard curvePrepare a nitrite dilution series using sodium nitrite (0, 3, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 300 μM) in deionized water.Pipette 0.",
    "5 ml nitrite dilution series (Test sample) into 1.5-ml tubes. Use 0.5 ml 10 mM sodium nitrate as a control (Blank sample).Add 0.5 ml sulfanilamide solution and 0.5 ml NED solution to all tubes.Mix by swirling and incubate at 25°C for 10 min.Transfer 1 ml assay mixture to a cuvette.Measure the visible absorption at 540 nm using the spectrophotometer.Calculate the absorbance change using the following equation:ΔA540 nm (Sample) = A540 nm (Test) - A540 nm (Blank)Plot the standard curve with the nitrite concentration on the horizontal axis and the absorbance change on the vertical axis (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4098/bioprotoc-11-14-4098-g001.jpgFigure 1. Nitrite standard curve. Error bars indicate the average value of three biological replicates ± SD (n = 3). According to the standard curve, the regression equation is x (µM) = (y-0.0204)/0.0092, where x stands for nitrite concentration and y stands for ΔA540 nm (Sample).In vitro NaR activity assayBefore preparing the reaction mixture for the enzyme assay, degas the solutions used in the assays and place in the anaerobic chamber before use.Pipette the following reagents for the nitrate reduction reaction (Tables 1 and 2) into a 1.5-ml tube inside the anaerobic chamber:Table 1.
