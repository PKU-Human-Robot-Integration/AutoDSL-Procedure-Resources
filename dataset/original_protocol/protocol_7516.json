    "We describe two protocols: one for the measurement of lipid metabolites in cells and the other to measure lipid utilization for energy production. Most of our experiments have been optimized for HEK 293FT cells, so we recommend users to optimize the cell counts if different cell types are used. Note that users using the mass spectrometry and the Seahorse XF analyzer for the first time should seek training or be accompanied by an experienced user before proceeding.Part I: Mass spectrometry protocol The protocol for extracting lipid metabolites is as follows:Prepare 108 HEK 293FT cells per replicate for lipid extraction. Users can grow these cells in T75 flasks or in Petri dishes, in DMEM growth medium supplemented with 8% FBS (DMEM GM). We recommend optimizing the cell counts if different cell types are used for measurement.Check the condition of cells before harvesting them for lipid extraction. Ensure that the cells form a confluent monolayer. Floating cells indicate cell death; users should minimize cell death before proceeding with lipid extraction.Pre-chill extraction solvent (made of two parts of methanol mixed with five parts of Milli-Q water) at 4 °C. The solvent is pre-chilled to stop the enzymatic reactions of the cells, so as to preserve the cell states during the harvesting and extraction process.Discard the growth media by either decanting or aspirating with a serological pipette.Wash the cells by adding 5 mL of 1× PBS at room temperature. Discard by decanting or aspirating with a serological pipette.Repeat the wash two times. After the final wash, discard by decanting or aspirating with a serological pipette.Add 560 μL of pre-chilled extraction solvent to the cell culture.Scrape cells with a cell scraper and transfer them into 2 mL Eppendorf tubes.Add 800 μL of pre-chilled MTBE to the tubes (Note 3).",
    "Shake the tubes using a TissueLyzer at 30 Hz for 5 min at 4 °C. Repeat two times.Sonicate the tubes in an ultrasonic cleaner pre-filled with ice and water for 15 min. Sonication reduces emulsion formation and assist in the phase separation in liquid–liquid extraction.Centrifuge the tubes at 845× g (3,000 rpm) for 15 min at 4 °C.Transfer the upper MTBE layer to a new Eppendorf tube and dry the solvent with a vacuum evaporator at room temperature.Store dried samples in a -80 °C freezer until use.The protocol for mass spectrometry analysis is as follows:Reconstitute dried samples in 100 μL of isopropanol/methanol (1:1) (Note 4).Vortex rigorously for 30 s and sonicate for 5 min.Centrifuge at 20,000× g (15,000 rpm) for 10 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant into LC vial for LC-QTOF MS analysis.Take 5 μL of each sample for pooling into one vial as the pooled QC sample (Note 5).Prepare mobile phase A water/acetonitrile (60:40) with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid.Prepare mobile phase B isopropanol/acetonitrile (90:10) with 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid (Castro-Perez et al., 2010).Analyze samples using an Agilent rapid resolution HT Zorbax SB-C18 (2.1 mm  100 mm, 1.8 μm). The autosampler is set at 4 °C and the injection volume is 5 μL. For users who are not familiar with the protocol or instrument, we recommend doing technical replicates to ensure that the readings obtained are consistent and reproducible.The column temperature is set at 40 °C and the flow rate is set at 0.3 mL/min.The solvent gradient is as follows: 0–2 min, 40% solvent B; 2–12 min, 40%–100% solvent B; 12–15 min, 100% solvent B; 15–15.5 min, 100%–40% solvent B; 15.5–20 min, 40% solvent B.",
    "Mass spectrometric analysis is performed in both ESI+ and ESI- modes using the Agilent iFunnel QTOF LC–MS (Figure 1, Note 6). Collect mass data between m/z 100 and 1,000 Dalton at a rate of two scans per second. The major parameter settings are as follows: the ion spray voltage is set at 4,000 V and the heated capillary temperature is maintained at 350 °C. The drying gas and nebulizer nitrogen gas flow rates are 12.0 L/min and 50 psi, respectively. Note that these settings may differ depending on the instrument used, so users will need to optimize their settings for different instruments.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20230809/20230809202945_7980.jpgFigure 1.

The detailed steps to execute the protocol are as follows:Day 1 Seeding cells onto Seahorse XFe24 cell culture plate Dilute HEK 293FT cells to 5 × 105 cells/mL and plate 200 μL of the cell suspension into each well of a SeahorseXFe24 cell culture plate, such that each well has 1 × 105 cells.Incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 overnight.Preparation of substrate-limited media and assay media Prepare the substrate-limited media supplemented with 1 mM glutamine, 1% FBS, and either 2.5 mg/mL of BSA-conjugated linoleic acid plus 2.5 mg/mL of BSA-conjugated oleic acid or 5 mg/mL of BSA only.Prepare the Seahorse assay media supplemented with either 2.5 mg/mL of BSA-conjugated linoleic acid plus 2.5 mg/mL of BSA-conjugated oleic acid or 5 mg/mL of BSA only.Day 2 Exchanging cell culture growth media with substrate-limited media Check the cells under a microscope to ensure that there is a confluent (> 90%) monolayer of cells.",
    "Wash the cells in each condition with the respective substrate-limited media (fatty acid–supplemented media or BSA-only media as control) (Figure 2). Remove 150 μL of growth media and add 150 μL of the substrate-limited media. Each condition should be performed in at least three replicates.Repeat the wash a second time by removing 150 μL of media but, this time, adding 200 μL of substrate-limited media to make a final volume of 250 μL of media in each well. Perform the washes gently to ensure that the cells are not dislodged.After the cell washes, check the cells under the microscope to ensure that the cell monolayer is still intact across the wells and that no cells have been dislodged.Leave the plate to incubate at 37 °C with 5% CO2 overnight.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4742/bioprotoc-13-16-4742-g002.jpgFigure 2. Example of photos showing how BSA or fatty acids can be used for washing and supplemented to the Seahorse XFe24 cell culture microplate to evaluate lipid dependencies for energy production Hydrating the sensor cartridges Hydrate the sensor cartridges according to the manufacturer’s instructions one day prior to running the Seahorse assay.Fill each well of the utility plate with 1 mL of XF calibrant solution.Lower the sensor cartridge carefully into the utility plate and ensure that the sensors are submerged.Leave the plate and cartridge to incubate in a non-CO2 37 °C incubator overnight (Figure 3). Ensure that the incubator is humidified to prevent evaporation of the calibrant.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4742/bioprotoc-13-16-4742-g003.jpgFigure 3. An example of an XF Prep Station that can be used for incubating the plates at 37 °C overnight Day 3 Dilute the drugs fresh on the day of assay. Refer to Recipes for details.Wash cells with assay media. Remove 150 μL of media and replace with 150 μL of assay media for each wash. Repeat the wash three times.",
    "After the third wash, remove 150 μL of media and add 275 μL of media to top up the volume in each well to 375 μL.Leave the cells to equilibrate in the assay media for at least 30 min in a 5% CO2 37 °C incubator, or in a humidified chamber during transport to a Seahorse facility.Load the drugs into the cartridge (Figure 4) with the following volumes:Port A: oligomycin (70 μL)Port B: FCCP (75 μL)Port C: rotenone + antimycin A (85 μL)imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4742/bioprotoc-13-16-4742-g004.jpgFigure 4. Seahorse XF analyzer. Left: an example of a cartridge for loading the drugs into the Seahorse XF analyzer. By default, each sample is assigned to each quadrant, where Port A can be assigned at the top left, Port B at top right, and Port C at bottom left. Right: the cartridge can then be loaded in a Seahorse XF analyzer.Turn on the Seahorse XF analyzer (Figure 4). Run the Wave software and select the mitochondria stress test assay template, which will assign ports A, B, and C to be oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone + antimycin A, respectively. Click Design to configure the sample positions on the plate map. A standard Seahorse protocol is set up as such:Calibrate.Equilibrate.Baseline readings: loop three times of mix (3 min), wait (2 min), and measure (3 min).Inject port A: loop three times of mix (3 min), wait (2 min), and measure (3 min).Inject port B: loop three times of mix (3 min), wait (2 min), and measure (3 min).Inject port C: loop three times of mix (3 min), wait (2 min), and measure (3 min).End program.Load the sensor cartridge with calibrant plate onto the machine tray and start the calibration step.",
    "Once the calibration is done, replace the calibrant plate with the cell culture plate and continue the run with the pre-set protocol."
