  "procedures": [
    "Note: All animal procedures were approved by the Nationwide Children’s Hospital Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.\n1. Pulmonary Heart Valve Harvest from a Heart Valve Donor Mouse\nAutoclave all the surgical tools before the surgery: 1x fine scissors, 3x micro forceps, 2x micro vascular clamps, 1x clamp applying forceps, 1x micro needle holder, 1x spring scissors, 1x retractor.\nA 6-8 week old female C57BL/6 mouse is used as a pulmonary heart valve donor. Remove the mouse from its cage and weigh it, then euthanize with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (Ketamine, 200 mg/kg and xylazine, 20 mg/kg, IP) overdose.\nClip the chest area and place the mouse in a dorsal recumbence position on a pad. Then make the thoracotomy. Expose the heart, make a small cut on the right atrium, and perfuse the left ventricle with ice cold saline.\nBluntly dissect the pulmonary artery (PA) from the ascending aorta. Cut out the pulmonary valve (PV) along with 2 mm cuff of pulmonary artery. Dispose of the remainder of the heart.\nStore the PV in cold heparin and saline solution (100 units/ml). Note: The PV can be kept in the solution for two hours before transplantation to the donor heart.\n2. Donor Heart Preparation\nA 6-8 week old female C57BL/6 mouse is used as a heart donor. Remove the mouse from its cage and weigh it, then euthanize with a ketamine/xylazine cocktail (ketamine, 200 mg/kg and xylazine, 20 mg/kg, IP) overdose. This is a terminal procedure. \nClip the chest area and place the mouse in a dorsal recumbence position on a pad. Then make the thoracotomy. Bluntly separate the heart, inferior vena cava (IVC), superior vena cava (SVC), ascending aorta, PA, and pulmonary vein. Perfuse the IVC with ice cold sterile saline.",
    "Ligate the IVC, SVC, and pulmonary vein with 6-0 silk suture then cut superior to the ligatures.\nCut the aorta and PA with 2 mm cuff.\nCut out the PV and dispose of it.\n3. Heart Valve Transplantation onto a Donor Heart\nImmediately after step 2.5, place the heart valve from step 1.5 into the donor heart and orient the heart valve.\nSecure the PV with a stitch on the right side of the valve using 10-0 monofilament sutures on tapered needles and start to suture continuously with 5-6 stiches from the other side of the PV.\nAfter finishing the front side, rotate the heart horizontally and start to suture the back side of the PV onto the donor heart.\nStore the heart in a cold sterile heparin/saline solution. Note: The donor heart can be kept in the solution for two hours before implantation to the recipient mouse.\n4. Heterotopic Heart Transplantation on to a Recipient Mouse\nA 6-8 week old female C57BL/6 mouse was used as a recipient. Remove the mouse from its cage and weigh it, then anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine cocktail (ketamine, 100 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg). Ketoprofen (5 mg/kg) is used as preanesthesia analgesic.\nAfter checking the level of sedation by tail pinching, clip the abdominal and chest hair. Lubricate the eyes with sterile ophthalmic ointment, and place the mouse in a dorsal recumbence position on a pad. Disinfect the abdomen with betadine and alcohol pads. Then cover the mouse with a sterile drape and expose the incision area only.\nMake a midline laparotomy incision from below the xyphoid to the suprapubic region, and insert a self retaining retractor. Wrap the intestines in saline moistened gauze. Bluntly define the infrarenal aorta and vena cava.",
    "Place two 6-0 silk sutures proximally and distally around the aorta and IVC to restrain blood circulation.\nPlace the donor heart on the right side of the abdominal aorta and cover it with sterile gauze. Moisturize it with saline.\nMake an aortotomy in the abdominal aorta using a 30 G needle and extend the opening with scissors to the size of the donor aorta.\nPerform an end-to side anastomosis using sterile 10-0 monofilament sutures on tapered needles. Secure the donor aorta with one stitch on proximal end of the opening in the abdominal aorta and start to suture continuously with 4-5 stiches from the distal end of the abdominal aorta.\nFlip the heart to the left side, cover it with saline infused gauze, and start to suture continuously with 4-5 stiches from the distal end of the abdominal aorta.\nMake a venotomy in the IVC using a 30 G needle and extend the opening to the size of the donor pulmonary artery.\nPerform an end to side anastomosis using sterile 10-0 monofilament sutures on tapered needles. Secure the donor PA with one stitch on the proximal end of the opening in the IVC and start to suture continuously with 4-5 stiches from the distal end of the inferior vena cava. This time, because the aorta is in the way, make sure suturing of the left wall of the donor’s PA is on the inside of the IVC.\nFlush the IVC lumen with heparin and saline solution (100 units/ml). Close the right wall of the donor PA and recipient IVC by suturing them continuously to the distal end.\nRemove the distal ligature and control the hemorrhage by applying a topical absorbable sterile hemostat agent. When the hemorrhage stops completely, remove the proximal suture and control the hemorrhage the same way.",
    "Return the intestines and close the abdominal musculature and skin in two layers using a 6-0 black polyamide monofilament suture.\nInject 0.5 ml saline subcutaneously and place the mouse in a recovery cage on a warming pad until the mouse is fully mobile. Upon recovery, return the mouse to a new cage with paper bedding. Give pain medication (Ibuprofen, 30 mg/kg, drinking water) for 48 hr. Do not return an animal that has undergone surgery to the company of other animals until fully recovered.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
