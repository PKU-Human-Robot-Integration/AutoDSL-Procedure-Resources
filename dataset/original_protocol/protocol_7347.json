    "Mounting embryos on an agar padMelt 4% agarose solution in a microwave oven.Dispense between 100 and 300 μL of the melted agarose solution in the center of the slide. Be cautious not to generate air bubbles. Immediately, flatten the drop by placing a glass slide perpendicular to the one holding the drop and press gently (Figure 4A). Let it stand for 1–2 min to allow the agarose to solidify.Gently separate the two slides by sliding one against the other. Using a clean glass slide as a blade, trim the flattened agar pad into an approximately 12 × 12 mm square (Figure 4B).Place 3 μL of M9 buffer at the center of the agar pad. The buffer is used to wash and maintain the embryos alive during the procedure.Under the stereotype microscope, collect 50–80 embryos with the worm pick and transfer them to the drop of M9 buffer on the agarose pad. When transferring embryos from a Petri dish to the agar pad on the slide, carry as little bacteria as possible. If too many bacteria are transferred, they will consume oxygen and cause the embryos to die.Gently squeeze a thin line of high vacuum grease around the agarose path (Figure 4C). Place a cover slip over the vacuum grease and press the corners gently to seal the slide (Figure 4D).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4554/bioprotoc-12-22-4554-g004.jpgFigure 4.

(D) Agar pad covered with a glass cover slip (yellow arrow) by pressing gently pressing the corners with a piper tip (black arrow).Time-lapse recording of C1, C2, and C3 phagosomesSet up microscope parameters: for DIC images, an exposure time of 0.",
    "2 s with a 10% neutral density filter is enough. The percentage of a neutral density filter represents the fraction of light that passes through the filter and illuminates the sample. For recording the mCherry::LGG-1/2 reporters, the exposure parameter for the mCherry channel is 0.1 s with 5% neutral density filter. For recording the engulfment marker ced-1::gfp, the parameter is 0.15 s with a 5% neutral density filter.For optimal imaging, align the DIC light path according to the manufacturer's instructions.Under the 20× objective, find embryos. Under the 100× objective, identify embryos at the age between 280 and 300 min post their first cell division and with their ventral side facing up (Figure 5). Mark these embryos utilizing the “point marking” and “position visiting” functions of the SoftWoRx software. For each strain, we image 15 embryos.Define the position where the z-section recording should start. The serial z-section recording is performed from the embryo's ventral surface and proceeds to the center of the embryo. Set up 12–16 z-sections at 0.5 μm thickness for each section, which is sufficient to cover the entire ventral region.Set up the time-lapse recording parameters. Start recording when the embryo is approximately 320 min post the first cell division; a moment later, the hypodermal cells will engulf apoptotic cells C1, C2, and C3 (Figure 1A). A clue hinting that the engulfment of C1, C2, and C3 is about to happen is the event when the middle part of the embryo slightly contracts towards its center, as shown in Figure 5. The recording time interval is set at every 2 mins for 60 to 120 min or until the embryos reach the 1.5-fold developmental stage, which is at 420 min post the first embryonic division.Keep observing the images during the acquisition process. Adjust the starting focal plane if necessary.",
    "Abort the recording if the embryos slow down or arrest their development. Examples of time-lapse images of LGG+ vesicles are recruited to the phagosomal surfaces and subsequently fuse to phagosomes are shown in Figure 1B.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4554/bioprotoc-12-22-4554-g005.jpgFigure 5.
