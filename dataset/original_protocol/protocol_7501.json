    "Preparation of the working directory Create a directory named tomogram.Download the tomogram GMPCPP_tomoFig5_bin4.mrc deposited on the EMPIAR database (access code 11264, see the link above) and save it to the tomogram folder.Modeling the protofilament path with 3dmod Open a terminal window and enter “cd your_path/tomogram.”Enter “3dmod GMPCPP_tomoFig5_bin4.mrc MT_Model.mod.” The 3dmod Information Window opens (Figure 1A) together with the ZaP window displaying the middle slice (151) of the tomogram (Figure 1B).Select the Model mode in the 3dmod Information Window (Figure 1A, red circle).Note: Regularly save the model during the modeling of the protofilament and microtubule paths using the short-cut key S. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4723/bioprotoc-13-14-4723-g001.jpgFigure 1. Tomogram visualization. (A) 3dmod Information Window. Selection of the Model mode (red circle). (B) 3dmod ZaP Window.On the main menu, select Image > Slicer (Figure 2A), click on the Checkerboard button to activate high-resolution drawing (red circle), on the Centering button (blue circle) to associate the Slicer and ZaP windows, enter 50 in the Thick: Img text box, and press Enter.In the ZaP window, scroll up to Slice 189 and click in the middle of the microtubule at the position marked by a yellow cross in Figure 2B (arrow). The corresponding microtubule segment is presented in the Slicer Window (Figure 2C).In the Slicer Window, position the X rotation slider to 90.0, the Z rotation slider to -57.4, and adjust the zoom text box to 10.00 with the up arrow of the slicer (Figure 2D). The microtubule is displayed in cross section and its protofilaments are well individualized.Notes:  The appropriate zoom level in the Slicer may vary depending on the screen resolution. A 10× zoom is appropriate for a MacBook Pro retina display, which translates to a 5× zoom on a classical display.",
    "If the microtubule is not oriented parallel to the plane of the tomogram, which happens frequently in thick ice layers, adjust the X rotation slicer to maximize the contrast of the protofilaments in cross-section. We advise modeling consistently a microtubule from the bottom towards the top of the tomogram, especially with microtubules showing a high degree of curvature in the XY plane. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4723/bioprotoc-13-14-4723-g002.jpgFigure 2.

In the window that opens (Figure 3A), click on Object type: Open (red circle) and adjust the Sphere radius for points to 3 (blue circle).In the Slicer (Figure 3B) unselect the Centering button (red circle) and click on the top protofilament with the middle button of the mouse. This creates a new contour at this position (green circle) and in the 3dmod Information Window (Figure 3C: Object 1, Contour 1, Point 1). Increase the thickness of the point by adjusting the Thick: Mod to 3.0 (Figure 3B, blue circle).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4723/bioprotoc-13-14-4723-g003.jpgFigure 3.

Here, 11 points were added (Figure 5).Note: During this procedure, recenter the microtubule cross-section with the left mouse key. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4723/bioprotoc-13-14-4723-g005.jpgFigure 5. Microtubule cross-sections at positions listed in Table 1 Notes:  Note that the protofilaments gradually rotate anticlockwise, since they have a ~0.7° left-handed skew. Note also that setting the X-axis slider to -90° instead of +90° would have produced a clockwise rotation of the protofilaments. If the protofilament rotates up to the edge of the microtubule cross-section where it cannot be individualized anymore, add a new contour (Edit > Contour > New), and click on another protofilament. Several contours may be necessary to model a long microtubule with skewed protofilaments. Modeling the microtubule center path In the Slicer Window, select the Centering button (Figure 6A, red circle), and in the Information Window, select point 1 in Contour 1 of Object 1 (Figure 6B).In the main menu, select Edit > Object > New.

Adjust the position of the point with the right click if necessary (Figure 6H).Repeat this operation for every point in Object 1 Contour 1.Note: If several contours have been created, repeat the operation for all contours. Save the model (short key S).Adding points spaced every ~8 nm in the model In the terminal, enter “addModPts MT_Model.mod 10 T.” A new file named “MT_Model_PtsAdded.mod” is created with points spaced every ~8 nm along the microtubule. Note the total number of points created as indicated in the terminal window (here, 81 points).Notes:  The voxel size of the tomogram is 8.3 Å. This can be verified using the command “header GMPCPP_tomoFig5_bin4.mrc.” The command “addModPts MT_model.mod 10 T” places points every 10 × 0.83 nm along the microtubule, i.e., every ~8 nm, which corresponds to the kinesin motor-domain repeat along protofilaments.",

Addition of points spaced every ~8 nm on the model. The points of Object 1 (green circles) follow the microtubule center path, and those of Object 2 (cyan circles) follow the protofilament path.In the terminal, enter “modTwist2EM MT_Model_PtsAdded.mod 10 1.” Two new files are created: a model file named “MT_Model_PtsAdded_Twisted.mod” and a motive list named “MT_Model_PtsAddedRefP10_initMOTL.csv.”Notes:  To list the files present in the working directory, enter “ls” on the terminal. The two numerical values in the modTwist2EM command are the point (10) and contour (1) numbers. The sub-volume extracted at this position will be used as the initial reference in the subtomogram averaging procedure. Hence, this reference point can be chosen based on the quality of the cross-section of the microtubule at any location along the microtubule.

    "Since we have selected the Particle Y axis as Particle model points in the Setup tab, Phi turns around the microtubule (Y) axis, Theta turns in plane, and Psi turns out off plane (Figure 9B). ii. Phi has been set to 12° (i.e., 24° since the search occurs in both directions) to keep the angular search restricted to an interval between two protofilaments. This number might be adjusted using 360°/2N, where N is the protofilament number.

The kinesin molecules display large longitudinal offsets between the three front protofilaments (Figure 12E), indicating that the underlying αβ-tubulin heterodimers share heterotypic lateral interactions of the A-type.",
    "In addition, the kinesin densities of the central protofilament are less well defined than those of the two adjacent protofilaments, suggestive of a transition in lattice-type in this region.Select the Etomo panel and click on File > Exit, then answer Yes to the question “There are still 3dmod programs running.

The three first segments display a A-lattice type organization in the three front protofilaments observed in the Y = 180° view (Figure 15A–15C), while the fourth segment displays a B-type lattice organization in the same region (Figure 15D), implicating that a hole of at least one monomer (or a larger odd number) exists at the transition region between segments 3 and 4 (visualized in the raw data, see Figure 5 of Guyomar et al., 2022).Note: An additional seam is visible on the right in all subvolumes and can be visualized more clearly by turning the maps around Y by 90°. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4723/bioprotoc-13-14-4723-g015.jpgFigure 15.
