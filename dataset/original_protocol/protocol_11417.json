    "The use of experimental research animals and infectious agents, such as lentivirus to transduce the cancer cells, require prior approval by the institutional animal care program and by the institutional biosafety committee. This protocol follows the animal care guidelines of the University of California San Diego (UCSD).\n1. Labeling of Glioblastoma Cells with FP635 or FP720 Construct\nProduce and purify lentivirus according to the protocol described by Tiscornia et al.12\nCulture approximately 2.0 x 106 cells from a human glioma cell line with DMEM plus 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a 15-cm dish; or culture 2.0 x 106 human glioblastoma patient-derived (GBM-PDX) spheres with DMEM/F12 1:1 medium with B27 supplement plus human recombinant epidermal growth factor (EGF; 20 ng/mL) and FGF (10 ng/mL) in a T75 flask.\nMaintain all cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% relative humidity.\nDissociate the cells.\n\t\nFor the glioma cells: remove the supernatant from the plates and adding 3-5 mL of trypsin 1X to the glioma cells.\nFor the GBM spheres: collect the cells by pipetting the cells into a 15-mL tube.\n\t\t\nSpin down the GBM spheres at 200 x g for 5 min using a tabletop centrifuge at room temperature.\nRemove the supernatant and add 3-5 mL of cell detachment solution.\nIncubate all cells at 37 °C for 10-15 min.\nCarefully dissociate the cells by pipetting up and down several times (ensure that spheres and glioma cells are completed dissociated) and spin down at 200 x g for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant and resuspend the cells with 5 mL of medium by pipetting up and down several times. Determine the cell viability by trypan blue exclusion.\nPlate 1.0 x 106 of target cells in a 10-cm dish with 5 mL of medium by pipetting.",
    "Transduce cells with lentivirus expressing fluorescent proteins at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 5 as is described by Tiscornia et al.12 and incubate at 37 °C.\nAfter 24 h, remove the medium from the transduced cells, add 5 mL of fresh medium, and incubate for additional 48 h at 37 °C.\nDissociate the infected cells into a single-cell suspension as described in steps 1.4-1.6. Spin down the cells at 200 x g for 5 min and resuspend in 500 µL of sorting solution (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 1% FBS).\nPipette the cell suspension into FACS tubes. Co-stain the cells with 1 µL/mL of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) dihydrochloride to exclude dead cells. Negative controls are required to set up the flow cytometer gates (non-transduced cells and non-transduced cells/ DAPI stained).\nSort the fluorescent-positive/DAPI-negative cells into sorting solution, as described by Basu et al.13, and collect the sorted cells into a 15-mL conical tube.\nSpin down the sorted cells at 200 x g for 5 min, remove the supernatant, and resuspend in 5 mL of culture medium. Seed the sorted cells in a 10-cm dish by pipetting. Incubate at 37 °C for at least 48-72 h.\nExpand the sorted cells by dissociating the cells following steps 1.4-1.6 and plating into multiple dishes for in vivo experiments.\n\tNOTE: For more details about cell sorting preparation and purification, see Basu et al.13\n2. Intracranial Injection of iRFP-tagged Glioblastoma Cells into Immunodeficient Mice\nNOTE: Before starting the surgery, make sure that the surgical room and tools are clean for the procedure. Use immunodeficient athymic nude (Foxn1nu) male or female mice, between 4-5 weeks old and 17-19 g for intracranial injections. Animals should be housed for at least 3 days after arrival and before surgery.\nCell preparation",
    "Harvest and dissociate fluorescent positive-glioma cells into a single-cell suspension (steps 1.4-1.6) and resuspend 0.5 or 1.0 x 106 cells in 2-5 µL of PBS per injection per animal. Pipette the cell suspension into a 1.5-mL microcentrifuge tube and place on ice.\nAnesthesia preparation and administration\n\t\nPrepare 200 µL of saline solution containing ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) per 20 grams of mouse body weight. Weigh the animals and calculate the appropriate dose of anesthesia.\nProvide an intraperitoneal injection of anesthesia and apply ophthalmic ointment to the eyes to prevent dehydration. For more details about this step see Kathleen et al.14 Place the animal on a pre-warmed water thermal pad at 37 °C.\nCheck that the animals are anesthetized by monitoring the toe pinch response (pedal reflex), usually within 5-10 min.\nIntracranial injection\n\t\nLoad a 5 µL Hamilton syringe (blunt tip needle) with cell suspension and mount in the probe holder.\nPlace the mouse in a small animal stereotactic frame and fix the head using the ear bars and the incisor adapter following the described details by Cetin et al.15\nDisinfect the head with 70% ethanol and betadine solution. Make sure that the surgical site is complete sterile. Perform a middle incision with a small scalpel and separate the skin and connective tissues.\nPlace the Hamilton syringe on the bregma point using the micromanipulator.\nMove the probe holder 1.0 mm anteroposterior and 2.0 mm lateral from the bregma point. Mark this position with a pencil.\nAt this location, carefully make a hole in the skull with a micromotor hand-held drill by applying slight pressure downward until the blood vessels become visible. Do not disrupt the arachnoid mater and brain parenchyma.\nIntroduce the needle into the burr hole and advance 3.0 mm below the pial surface.",
    "Set up the volume (2-5 µL) and flow rate (1 µL/min) of injection using a motorized stereotaxic injector or manually perform the injection.\nAfter the injection, remove the needle gradually by ascending 1.0 mm every 1 min and clean the injection site with 70% ethanol.\nClose the skin wound with surgical staples or by making surgical sutures (often referred to as stitches) and see Kathleen et al.14 for more details.\nAnimal recovery\n\t\nTransfer the animal to a water thermal pad (37 °C) and monitor the body temperature, respiration rate, and heart rate, until full recovery. Administer analgesia per standard protocols.\n\t\tNOTE: For more information about the stereotactic procedure, surgery, and coordinates, see other reports5,14,15.\n3. FMT Imaging\nNOTE: According to the experimental aim, the iRFP-tagged glioblastoma cells can be monitored in vivo before, during, or after treatment. For imaging purpose, anesthetize animals using an isoflurane induction chamber, maintain in an imaging cassette during the scanning, and image in the docking station of the FMT imager.\nRemove the animal from the cage and place in the isoflurane induction chamber. Close the chamber and turn on oxygen flow and vaporizer to 3-5%.\nMonitor the animal until it is completely anesthetized, usually within 1-2 min. Unconscious animals should not respond to external stimuli.\nRemove the anesthetized animal from the chamber and put the animal in the imaging cassette by placing the head adaptor first, followed by placing the animal facing down. Make sure that the head is located in the center of the cassette.\nPlace the top plate of the cassette on top and tighten the adjustment knobs until 17 mm.",
    "Once that the animal is secure in the imaging cassette, proceed to imaging by inserting the cassette into the internal docking station of the FMT imager, where the isoflurane is pumped to keep the animal anesthetized.\nRun the imager and analyzer software by double-clicking the software icon.\nIn the \"Experimental tab\" window, select the \"Database\" and \"Study group\".\nGo to the \"Scan tab\" window and select the subject to image by clicking \"select subject\". Also, select the laser channel in the \"Laser channel\" panel. For the FP635-labeled cells, select \"laser channel 635 nm\", and for FP720-labeled cells, select \"laser channel 680 nm\".\nAcquire an image by clicking the \"Capture\" option in the \"Scan tab\" window. Then, adjust the scan field by clicking and dragging the scan field in the captured image to a determined number of source locations, usually within 20-25 sources for the ipsilateral side.\nCheck the \"Add to reconstruction queue\" option and hit \"Scan\" in the \"Scan tab\" window.\nWait until the scanning is completed and then remove the imaging cassette from the docking station.\nRemove the top plate of the cassette and place the animal back into the cage.\nRepeat the steps 3.1-3.12 for the rest of the animals.\n4. Image Analysis\nFrom the imager and analyzer software, select the \"Analysis tab\" window.\nLoad the dataset and the subject to analyze by clicking the \"+\" button in the \"Dataset selection\" panel of the \"Analysis tab\" window.\nOnce the image has been loaded in the \"Analysis tab\" window, perform the region of interest (ROI) analysis by selecting the ellipsoid icon, located in the upper left corner of the \"Analysis tab\" window.\nAdjust the threshold to zero in the \"statistic data\" panel by right clicking the \"threshold\" column in the \"Analysis tab\" window.",
    "The total value in the \"Statistic data\" panel represents the signal from the fluorescent-tagged glioblastoma cells implanted in the mouse brain.\nRepeat steps 4.2-4.4 for the rest of the animals. Load or remove a new subject by clicking the \"+\" or \"−\" button, respectively, in the \"Dataset selection\" panel of the \"Analysis tab\" window.\n\tNOTE: For more information about the FMT imaging and software operation, see20.\nSubscription Required.
