  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: The recombinant proteins used in this study, Hsp90 and Cdc37, were commercially obtained (see Table of Materials).\n1. Chip activation\nNOTE: All materials to be used in the experiment are listed in the Table of Materials. Filter all prepared solutions through a sterile 0.2 μm filter.\nPrepare 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino propyl) carbodiimide (EDC) solution by adding 2 mg of EDC to 2.5 mL of 1 M 2-(N-morpholino) ethane sulfonic acid (MES) buffer (pH = 6.0) in a 15 mL tube. Prepare N-Hydroxysulfosuccinimide (sulfo-NHS) solutions by adding 6 mg of sulfo-NHS to 2.5 mL of 1 M MES buffer (pH = 6.0) in a separate 15 mL tube. Aliquot 50 µL of each solution in independent tubes and store at -20 °C for future use.\nMix equal volumes of EDC sand sulfo-NHS solution (50 µL of EDC + 50 µL of sulfo-NHS) by pipetting up and down (do not vortex).\n\tNOTE:  The mixed solution of EDC/sulfo-NHS must be used within 30 min to maintain effective cross-linking for proper chip functionalization.\nPlace the biosensor chip (5.7 cm x 2.4 cm; see Table of Materials) supplied by the company in a glass Petri dish with a fitted lid. All the functionalization steps involved in chip activation are suggested to be done within the Petri dish. Apply 50 µL of 1 M MES buffer (pH = 6.0) to the biosensor chip, incubate for 1 min at room temperature, and then aspirate the buffer.\nApply 50 µL of EDC/sulfo-NHS solution immediately to the sensor chip. Cover the Petri dish and incubate for 15 min at room temperature.  Aspirate EDC/sulfo-NHS solution from the chip.\nRinse the chip once with 50 µL of 1 M MES buffer (pH = 6.0); aspirate the MES buffer.\n2. Target protein immobilization",
    "Rinse the chip 2x with 50 µL of 1x PBS (pH = 7.4). Aspirate the PBS from the chip and add the target molecule, Hsp90 (50 µL; 500 nM).\n\tNOTE:  Buffer mismatch may ruin the entire experiment; hence, before the experiment, it is important to make sure that the target molecule is in the same buffer as that used for calibration (e.g., 1x PBS (pH = 7.4)). If needed, perform a buffer exchange by overnight dialysis before the experiment. In this experiment, overnight dialysis was performed for both recombinant proteins, Hsp90 and Cdc37, against 1x PBS (pH = 7.4; see Table of Materials) with proper buffer exchange at 4 °C. The concentration of the target material (Hsp90 in this case) may vary according to different experimental protocols and the nature of target materials (protein/peptide/ligands).\nCover the glass Petri dish and incubate for 30 min at room temperature. Aspirate the solution containing the target molecule and rinse 3x with 50 µL of 1x PBS (pH = 7.4). Aspirate the 1x PBS (pH = 7.4) solution from the chip.\nAdd 50 µL of Quench 1 (3.9 mM amino-PEG5-alcohol in 1x PBS (pH = 7.4)) solution to the chip. Cover the glass Petri dish and incubate for 15 min at room temperature. Aspirate the Quench 1 solution from the chip.\nAdd 50 µL of Quench 2 (1 M ethanolamine (pH = 8.5)) solution to the chip. Cover the glass Petri dish and incubate for 15 min at room temperature. Aspirate Quench 2 solution from the chip and rinse the chip 5x using 50 µL of 1x PBS, leaving the last PBS droplet on the sensor.\n3. Preparing analyte samples",
    "Prepare analyte dilution series for Cdc37 in the desired concentration range. For the first experiment, the following concentrations were used: 25 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM, 200 nM, 400 nM, 800 nM, 1,000 nM, 2,000 nM, 3,000 nM, and 5,000 nM. For the second experiment, a different set of concentrations ranging from 0.4 nM to 200 nM was used.\nDesign the experiment to include at least eight different analyte concentrations to obtain a reliable KD value. Prepare the different dilutions of the analyte protein in the same buffer as that used for calibration and target protein; here it is 1x PBS (pH = 7.4).\n4. Loading of the activated biosensor chip into the FEB device\nNOTE: The FEB device consists of a reader featured with LED light indications and a cartridge to insert the biosensor chip.\nAfter target protein immobilization, insert the activated chip into the cartridge of the device, which is connected via USB to a computer. After the chip insertion, a green LED light will be displayed on the reader indicating that the FEB device is ready for the experiment. Install the automated software (see Table of Materials) supplied by the company on the computer, to which the FEB device is connected, to monitor the experiment step by step as described below.\n5. Run the experiment\nPress the Run Experiment module on the automated software and choose 10 Points with Regeneration or any other desired protocol. Fill in the following details: operator name, experiment name, date (e.g., Yana, Hsp90 + Cdc37, 14.03.2021); regeneration buffer (e.g., PBS buffer); immobilized target (e.g., Hsp90); analyte in solution (e.g., Cdc37). See Supplementary Figure S1 for details.\nPress the Begin the Experiment button displayed on the software and follow the instructions shown by the automated software as described below.",
    "NOTE: The software is fully automated, user-friendly, and guides the user throughout the experiment step by step. A pop-up window will appear on the screen with instructions to proceed further at each step of the experiment. The software will provide instructions for each repetitive step consecutively from calibration, analyte association, dissociation, regeneration, and wash (5x) for each analyte concentration throughout the experiment.\nPerform instrument calibration. To do so, aspirate the remaining PBS solution from the chip and apply 50 µL of calibration buffer (1x PBS; pH = 7.4). Press the Continue button and wait for 5 min until the calibration step is finished. The software displays the endpoint determined for the calibration step (5 min) with a warning alarm to follow-up.\nNext, perform an analyte association. To do so, aspirate the calibration buffer from the chip and apply 50 µL of the lowest analyte concentration (25 nM of Cdc37). Press the Continue button and wait for 5 min until the association step is finished. The software displays the endpoint for the association step (5 min) with a warning alarm to proceed.\nPerform an analyte dissociation. To do so, aspirate the analyte solution from the chip and apply 50 µL of the dissociation buffer (1x PBS; pH = 7.4). Press the Continue button and wait for 5 min until the dissociation step duration (5 min) is finished. The software displays the endpoint for the dissociation step (5 min) with a warning alarm to follow-up.",
    "Next, perform chip regeneration. Aspirate the dissociation solution from the chip and apply 50 µL of regeneration buffer (1x PBS; pH = 7.4). Press the Continue button and wait for 30 s until the regeneration step duration (30 s) is finished. The software displays the endpoint for the regeneration step (30 s) with a warning alarm to follow-up.\nFinally, wash the chip. Aspirate the regeneration solution from the chip and apply 50 µL of wash buffer (1x PBS; pH = 7.4) to the chip. Aspirate the solution from the chip and repeat this 5x. Leave the last drop of wash buffer on the chip and press the Continue button and wait for 30 s until the wash step duration is finished in the software display.\n\t​NOTE: The software displays the endpoint for the wash step (30 s) with a warning alarm to proceed with the next cycle of the experiment.\nRepeat the steps for each analyte concentration used; the five steps of calibration, analyte association, dissociation, regeneration, and wash (5x) constitute one cycle. For the experiment shown here, we performed 10 cycles for 10 analyte concentrations (ranging from 25 nM to 5,000 nM or 0.4 nM to 200 nM; Figure 2).\n6. Analysis\nPress the Analysis button seen at the top of the automated analysis software at the end of the experiment. A display window containing all the experimental points will appear. In the window, ensure that the analyte concentrations used for the prescribed protocol are correct.\nPress the Run Analysis button to generate the KD value automatically. The software generates a Hill fit plot by plotting the analyte concentrations against the corresponding I-Responses from which the dissociation constant at equilibrium, KD value, is calculated.",
    "Export the raw data for analysis in other statistical analysis software by using the data review/export software as described below.\n\t\nCopy the R1R file created automatically at the end of the experiment (e.g., Hsp90 + Cdc37 14.03.2021) to a new folder on the desktop. Open the Data Review/Export software supplied by the company (see Supplementary Figure S2A).\nClick on Data Processing > Process R1R files > OK on the home screen of the data review/export software.\nSelect the folder containing R1R files created on the desktop in step 6.3.1. and press the OK button. This creates a copy of the original R1R data, to review and edit the data without overriding the original file.\nPress the data processing icon seen at the home screen of the data review/export software. Press Load Processed R1R Files > OK. Select the same folder created in step 6.3.1 containing processed R1R files. Press OK. At this step, the folder containing the experiment files is ready to be reviewed.\nAt the home screen of data review/export software, press Data Analysis. Select Calibration > Calibrate edited R1R files > OK (see Supplementary Figure S2B). This step calibrates all the data points according to the first calibration step, to create a baseline.\nAt the home screen of data review/export software, press Data Analysis. Select Review and Edit R1R Files > OK. Review the data points, delete points, or add steps by using the Delete/Add Step button. Make sure all the steps are in the correct place, e.g., the calibration step is on the baseline, the association step is at the peak (see Supplementary Figure S3), and then press the Save button to save all the changes made.",
    "At the home screen of data review/export software, press Data Analysis. Select Analyze/Plot Data, choose the steps to export (see Supplementary Figure S4). Add each association step (e.g., step 2, step 7, and so on) after subtracting the calibration step (e.g.,step 1, step 6, and so on) to the export list before exporting the data.\nPress Export this Data. The software generates a spreadsheet file containing the I-Response for each analyte concentration data point from each transistor (if all transistors are working, we will have three different I-response values for each concentration point). Use this spreadsheet file to further analyze the data in the statistical software.\nOpen the statistical analysis software. Create an XY table with three Y values; press Create. The data for this table (X, Y values) is copied from the spreadsheet file created in step 6.3.8. The x-axis corresponds to analyte concentration (depending on the concentration used), and the three Y values correspond to the I-Responses, obtained from the Data Review/Export software supplied by the company.\nPress Analyze this Data. Choose XY Analyses > Nonlinear Regression (Curve Fit) > Binding Saturation > One Site > Total. The software will automatically analyze the data, generate the KD value, and create a graph of the data points.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
