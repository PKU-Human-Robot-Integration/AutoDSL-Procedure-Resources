    "The University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review board approved this protocol. We excluded subjects if they were under 18 years of age or were pregnant.\n1. Oral Cavity Evaluation: Disease Assessment and Papilla Identification\nInstruct the subject to open the mouth.\nUsing a light source such as a penlight or headlamp, illuminate the oral cavity and examine the seven subsites of the area (tongue, floor of mouth, buccal mucosa, labial mucosa, gingiva, hard palate, and retromolar trigone).\nVisualize the dorsal surface of the tongue. Instruct the subject to lift up the tongue, and examine the ventral tongue surface and floor of mouth, making sure to extend the examination posteriorly to the molars.\nUsing a tongue depressor, lateralize the subject's cheek to visualize the buccal mucosa, as well as the lateral gingiva bilaterally surrounding the upper and lower teeth.\nExtend the examination anteriorly by lifting the upper and lower lips to visualize the surfaces of the labial mucosal and anterior gingiva.\nFinally, visualize the hard palate and retromolar trigone.\nNote lesions, abrasions, and masses or signs of inflammation.\nAgain, ask the subject to open the mouth and extend the tongue.\nUse a light source to visualize the dorsal surface of the tongue.\nIdentify the presence or absence of FP, e.g., a smooth tongue surface\nNote the results of the oral cavity examination before proceeding with taste testing. If investigators conduct this taste test in a medical context, unexpected findings should prompt further work-up.\n2. Psychophysical Taste Testing\nNOTE: Resources and descriptions for the psychophysical taste testing that follow are also available from the following web page: https://osf.io/hn87s/.\nTastant preparation",
    "Prepare solutions as directed below. Make each solution using a volumetric flask to ensure precision of concentrations to ± 0.0002 M. Dissolve samples using ultrapure water. Tailor the choice of compounds to the research goals. The compounds included here are meant as one example.\n\t\t\nDenatonium benzoate (bitter): prepare a stock solution of 4.99 x 10-3 M denatonium benzoate by dissolving 2.228 g of denatonium benzoate in 1 L of water. Add 180 µL of this stock solution to a 500 mL volumetric flask. Add water to bring the volume to 500 mL, producing a solution with a final concentration of 1.8 µM.\nPTC (bitter): Place 0.0135 g of PTC in a 500 mL volumetric flask. Add water to bring the volume to 500 mL. PTC is difficult to dissolve, so place a stir bar in the flask and heat the solution to 70 °C on a hot plate. Use the stir bar to mix the solution until all solute has dissolved (~15 min). This produces a solution with a final concentration of 180 µM.\nQuinine (bitter): Place 0.011 g of quinine HCl dihydrate in a 500 mL volumetric flask. Add water to bring the volume to 500 mL, producing a solution with a final concentration of 56 µM.\nSodium chloride (salty): Place 7.5 g of sodium chloride in a 500 mL volumetric flask. Add water to bring the volume to 500 mL, producing a solution with a final concentration of 0.25 M.\nSucrose (sweet): Place 60 g of sucrose in a 500 mL volumetric flask. Add water to bring the volume to 500 mL, producing a solution with a final concentration of 0.35 M.",
    "Store taste solutions at 4 °C. Some commonly used taste compounds are light-sensitive, and investigators should wrap them in foil or other materials to reduce their exposure to light.\nTo identify common errors in solution preparation, fill one tasting cup with the old solution and one with the new solution. Taste each solution to verify they are identical in strength.\nInclude water as a control solution, presented in the first position to verify subjects understand the testing procedure. Present subjects with each tastant and the control tastant twice, taking care to avoid presenting the same tastant consecutively. For example, to test five unique tastants, feature twelve samples in the questionnaire (see 2.2): the five tastants and water, each presented twice. Aliquot 5 mL of water into individual glass scintillation vials. Label the vial caps with a dark blue sticker bearing the number 1.\nRepeat this process for each tastant. Label vial caps with a circular sticker according to the order of presentation and some color code, example detailed below; match the vial labels with the labels on the taste questionnaire (see 2.2).\n\t\tWater (dark blue)\n\t\tQuinine (light blue)\n\t\tNaCl (green)\n\t\tPTC (yellow)\n\t\tSucrose (orange)\n\t\tDenatonium benzoate (red)\n\t\tNaCl (dark blue)\n\t\tDenatonium benzoate (light blue)\n\t\tWater (green)\n\t\tQuinine (yellow)\n\t\tSucrose (orange)\n\t\tPTC (red)\nPackage samples by placing them into two boxes, samples 1–6 and 7–12 in boxes labeled \"box A\" and \"box B,\" respectively (Figure 1); other packaging strategies are possible.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56705/56705fig1v2.jpg\nFigure 1: Taste kit. Subjects use the kit to rate taste intensity and quality of various color-coded tastants. Box A contains samples 1–6, box B contains 7–12.

    "Prepare the taste questionnaire using a category scale for rating taste intensity and a forced choice for identifying the taste quality of each tastant (Figure 2).\nPlace circular labels of the appropriate color and number next to the appropriate sample in the taste questionnaire (see 2.1.6).\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56705/56705fig2.jpg\nFigure 2: Taste questionnaire entry, comprising a category scale for intensity rating and forced choice response for tastant quality. The taste questionnaire will include one entry for each of the color-coded tastants tested. Please click here to view a larger version of this figure.[href=https://www.jove.com//cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56705/56705fig2large.jpg]\nTaste Test Administration\nProvide subjects with box A, box B, a bottle of water, empty cup, pen, and pen-and-paper taste questionnaire containing entries for 12 samples. Use the same brand of bottled water throughout the duration of any given study. As an alternative to a paper questionnaire, port the material into online survey software and administered via tablet or desktop/Laptop. A sample template is available at https://osf.io/hn87s/.\nInstruct subjects that they will be asked to rate both the intensity and quality (e.g., salty, sour, bitter, sweet, or no flavor) of each tastant. Also, inform subjects they may not experience all qualities.\nExplain the testing procedure, as follows: Rinse your mouth twice with water and spit it out in the cup provided. Pour all of sample 1 into your mouth and hold it there for 5 seconds before spitting the solution into the cup. Do not gargle or swallow the solution. Circle one of the 13 vertical lines corresponding with the sample's intensity, on a scale of 0 to 12, from \"no intensity at all\" to \"extremely intense\" and choose a single quality to describe the taste. Afterward, rinse your mouth with water twice before proceeding to the next sample.",
    "Observe the subject tasting and rating sample 1 (water). Should the rating deviate from \"no intensity at all\" and \"no flavor,\" reiterate the questionnaire instructions before allowing the test to proceed.\nReview the finished questionnaire for completeness.\nScore intensity ratings on a scale of 0 to 12 from the vertical lines that the subjects circled. Average the two intensity ratings for each tastant; this value will be used for analysis.\n3. Genotype\nCollect saliva from each subject using a saliva DNA collection kit.\nPurify genomic DNA from the sample by following manufacturer instructions.\nDetermine TAS2R38 genotype using SNP genotyping assays (rs713598,rs1726866, rs10246939)40.\nDetermine TAS2R19 genotype using SNP genotyping assays (rs10772420)36.\n4. Genotype-phenotype Validation\nReview the available pooled control data from over 800 subjects genotyped for TAS2R38 (rs713598, rs1726866, rs10246939) and TAS2R19 (rs10772420) at the following web page: https://carayata.shinyapps.io/TasteBoxplots/.\nBased on a subject's TAS2R38 genotype, compare his or her psychophysical taste response for the bitter compound PTC with the norms for individuals of the same genotype. Responses should match; however, in rare cases, TAS2R38 genotype does not perfectly predict PTC sensory results35.\nShould responses show significant divergence, compare the subject's taste response for quinine with the norms for individuals of the same TAS2R19 genotype. Responses for quinine intensity and genotype should match36. Should all taste results fail to correspond with genotype, it is possible that the subject (a) does not understand the task (b) is providing spurious ratings or malingering or (c) there has been an data collection error on the part of the investigator.\nIdentify data point outliers, and perhaps exclude them from analysis (Figure 3). Correspondence of sensory results with objective genotyping validates the reliability of the psychophysical testing procedure.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
