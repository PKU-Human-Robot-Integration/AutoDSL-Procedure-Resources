    "**Step A: removing non-invertebrate contamination based on BLASTX hits**\nThe input to Step A is an initial genome assembly for a parasitic worm. \n1. Each scaffold of the initial genome assembly is split into 50 kb chunks. \n  \n2. For each 50 kb chunk, BLASTX is run against two in-house sequence databases consisting of \\(i) all invertebrate proteins from GenBank, and \\(ii) all proteins in the full proteomes of representative species from major non-invertebrate taxa \\(bacteria, vertebrates, fungi, plants, etc.), respectively. Only representative species are included here to reduce run-time. The –dbsize BLAST option is used to ensure that the E values from searching databases of different sizes are comparable.\n  \n3. For a particular chunk, if the e-value for its top non-invertebrate hit is 1E+10 fold lower than the e-value of its top invertebrate hit \\(e.g. E-60 versus E-50), the chunk is considered to be contaminant. \n  \n4. If more than half of the chunks of a scaffold are classified as contaminant, the whole scaffold is considered contaminant and is removed from the assembly. \n  \nThe output from Step A is a genome assembly from which likely contaminant scaffolds have been removed.\n**Step B: removing non-invertebrate contamination based on BLASTP hits**\nThe input to Step B is the de-contaminated genome assembly from Step A above, and a set of protein-coding gene predictions for this assembly \\(e.g. from a gene-finding software such as Augustus \\(Hoff & Stanke 2013)), along with their predicted protein sequences. \n1. BLASTP searches \\(using the –dbsize option) of predicted proteins from genes on scaffolds remaining after Step A are run against the search databases listed in Step A above.",
    "2. For each protein, if its top BLASTP hit is to a non-invertebrate protein, and has an e-value that is 1E+50 times lower than that of the best invertebrate hit, then the gene is considered a putative contaminant gene. \n  \n3. Conversely, if the top hit is to an invertebrate protein, and its e-value is 1E+50 times lower than that of the best non-invertebrate hit, the gene is classified as non-contaminant. \n  \n4. If more than half of the classified genes on a scaffold are considered contaminant, then the scaffold is classified as contaminant and removed from the assembly.\n  \nThe output from Step B is a genome assembly from which any additional likely contaminant scaffolds have been removed.\n**Step C: removing contamination from other invertebrates, based on BLASTP hits**\nStep C is a more stringent version of Step B, designed to remove contamination originating from other invertebrates \\(for example, flatworm contamination in a nematode assembly), as well as any residual contamination from non-invertebrates \\(e.g. bacteria) not removed by Steps A or B.\nThe input to Step C is the de-contaminated genome assembly from Step B above, and a set of protein-coding gene predictions for this assembly. \n1. For the non-contaminant scaffolds that remain after step B, predicted protein sequences for genes on these scaffolds are BLASTP-searched \\(with the –dbsize option) against the database of non-invertebrate proteins used in steps A and B, plus either nematode or flatworm protein sequences from GenBank. \n  \n2. For each query gene on a scaffold from a flatworm species’ assembly, the top ten BLASTP hits in nematodes/non-invertebrates and in the flatworm database are recorded.",
    "3. If the top five of these ten BLAST hits are to nematodes/non-invertebrates, and the e-value of the worst nematode/non-invertebrate hit is at least 5 orders of magnitude lower than the e-value of the best flatworm hit, the query gene is considered to be a contaminant gene. \n  \n4. Conversely, if the top five of the ten hits are to flatworm, and the e-value of the worst flatworm hit is 5 orders of magnitude lower than that of the best nematode/non-invertebrate hit, the query gene is considered a non-contaminant gene. \n  \n5. If a scaffold has one or more contaminant genes, and no non-contaminant genes, it is considered to be a contaminant scaffold and removed.\n  \nThe output from Step C is a genome assembly from which any additional likely contaminant scaffolds have been removed."
