    "1. Design and Vector Construction for Targeting Vectors\nOnce the lineage specific marker is determined, locate the genomic sequence of the gene and design the homology arms accordingly. The length of 5’ homology arm is ~1 kb and of 3’ homology arm is ~1.5 kb (Figure 1).\nTag the reporter cassette sequentially downstream of the genomic sequence right before the stop codon, by subcloning, so that the endogenous expression is not altered or disrupted. Link the reporter, or dual reporter cassette(s), with self-cleaving 2A peptide sequences (F2A, E2A or T2A) 20,21, or internal ribosome entry site (IRES).\n\tNote: Reporters may include fluorescent proteins such as GFP, tdTomato, tagRFP, YFP, luciferase, or antibiotic resistance cassette, a combination of fluorescent protein and antibiotic resistance cassette. An example is shown in Figure 1 for constructing targeting vector for human ALDH1L1 gene, tagged by EGFP and neomycin resistance cassette.\nAdd a positive selection cassette downstream of the reporter. The positive selection is a floxed antibiotic resistant cassette which will be excised from the targeted iPSCs after the positive clones are selected and isolated.\nInclude a negative selection cassette outside of the 3’ homology arm. Common negative selection cassettes are thymidine kinase, TK, and diphtheria toxin A (DTA) 22.\nObtain a human BAC clone containing the sequence of the lineage marker and verify the clone by PCR amplification. Construct the targeting vector in pKD46 containing-DH5α using recombineering to pull down the targeting site 23. Apply multisite gateway, Golden gate strategies23,24 when necessary.\n2. Design and Vector Construction of sgRNAs for CRISPR/Cas9 System.\nDetermine the lineage specific marker that will be targeted to make the reporter. Copy the cDNA sequence from NCBI database. Go to the human BLAT search to obtain genomic DNA alignment.",
    "Click the tab “browser” to view the assembly of the gene. Under “View” tab, click “DNA” to obtain the full genomic DNA sequence in FASTA format.\nLocate the stop codon within the DNA sequence, where the 2A sequence and the reporter cassette will be tagged.\nSearch for the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM, i.e., NGG) within the vinicity (~100 bp flanking area) of the stop codon. Scan both strands to locate the appropriate NGG sequence. Consider the specificity of the upstream sequences to avoid potential off-target events. Use open source tools such as BLAST and CasOT (see Step 5 for details).\nCopy the sequence of 20 bases immediately upstream of NGG and paste it into the web designing tool ZiFit to design oligos with overhangs compatible with human-gRNA-expression vector (with U6 promoter) MLM3636.\nSynthesize both forward and reverse oligos 7.\nTo make double-stranded sgRNA, denature both oligos at 70 °C for 15 min, and gradually cool down to RT. For a 50 µl reaction, add 22.5 µl of forward and reverse oligos (stock concentration is 0.1 mM) respectively, and 5 µl of annealing buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0).\nMix and ligate the oligos obtained from step 2.7 with BsmBI-digested human-gRNA-expression vector (with U6 promoter) MLM3636. For a 20 µl reaction, add 1 µl of oligos from Step 2.7, 100 ng of MLM3636, and 1 µl (400 U) of T4 ligase. Incubate at RT O/N.\nTransform DH5α competent cells with the ligation product by heat shock at 42°C for 30 sec. Grow the bacteria in LB agar Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) plate at 37°C O/N. Pick 3~5 colonies for plasmid miniprep according to manufacturer’s protocol. Sequence the plasmid DNA to confirm using commercial vendors. Maxiprep the correct plasmid according to manufacturer’s protocol.",
    "Evaluate sgRNA by T7 endonuclease 1 (T7E1) assay (see Step 4 for details). Transfect hiPSC with the plasmid and sgRNA will be expressed under the built-in U6 promoter in the MLM3636 backbone (See step 6 for details).\n3. Design and Construction of Cas9n Double Nickase sgRNA\nObtain double nickase Cas9n D10A vector pX335-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9n (D10A).\nDesign a pair of forward and reverse oligos for each targeting locus. Copy the sequence of 20 bases immediately upstream of NGG as described in Step 2 and paste it into web designing tool ZiFit\nTo obtain oligos with overhangs compatible with pX335-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9n (D10A), remove the first and last base of both forward and reverse oligos that are shown by the ZiFit designing tool.\nSynthesize forward and reverse oligos7. Name these oligos as f(n)-F, f(n)-R for PAMs on one side of the target site, r(n)-F, r(n)-R for PAMs on the other side of the target site. Of these, n is the number to designate different PAMs, lowercase f and r represent the location of the PAMs either at sense (f) or antisense (r) strand,, F and R represent forward and reverse oligos.\n\t\nTest multiple pairs (e.g., r5 and f2) using the T7E1 assay (detailed in Step 4) to identify the optimized pair of sgRNAs to be used for Cas9n.\nTo make double-stranded sgRNA, denature both oligos at 70 °C for 15 min, and gradually cool down to RT. For a 50 µl reaction, add 22.5 µl of forward and of reverse oligos (stock concentration is 0.1 mM) respectively, and 5 µl of annealing buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM EDTA, 1.5 M NaCl, pH 8.0).",
    "Mix and ligate the oligos obtained from step 3.5 with BbsI-digested pX335-U6-Chimeric_BB-CBh-hSpCas9n (D10A). For a 20 µl reaction, add 1 µl of sgRNA from Step 3.5, 100 ng of Cas9n (D10A), 1 µl (400 U) of T4 ligase. Incubate at RT O/N.\nTransform DH5α competent cells with the ligation product by heat shock at 42 °C for 30 sec. Grow the bacteria in LB agar Ampicillin (100 μg/ml) plate at 37 °C O/N. Pick 3~5 colonies for plasmid miniprep according to manufacturer’s protocol. Sequence the plasmid DNA to confirm using commercial vendors. Maxiprep the correct plasmid according to manufacturer’s protocol.\nEvaluate sgRNA by T7E1 assay (see Step 4 for details). Transfect hiPSC with the plasmid and sgRNA will be expressed under the built-in U6 promoter in the Cas9n (D10A) backbone (See step 6 for details).\n4. Evaluation of sgRNAs by T7 Endonuclease1 (T7E1) Assay\nFor one 24-well plate, plate 2 x 105 293FT cells per well one day prior (day -1).\nOn the day of transfection (day 0), co-transfect 293FT cells with sgRNA plasmid and Cas9 expression vector. Add 0.5 µg of sgRNA vector, 0.5 µg of Cas9 expression vector JDS246 (Cas9-003), and 1.5 µl of Lipofectamine 2000.\n\t\nFor negative control, add 0.5 µg of GFP expression vector (e.g., CMV promoter driven GFP in a pcDNA3 backbone) instead of sgRNA vectors.\nAfter 72 hr (day 3), harvest cells by adding 100 µl of DNA quick extraction buffer and triturating vigorously.\nIncubate the mixture at 68 °C for 15 min, then 95 °C for 8 min. This is the template for the subsequent PCR experiments.\nDesign both forward and reverse PCR primers to amplify the sequence flanking PAM. Usually the targeting PCR product is around 400-500 bp in length. Synthesize the oligos7.",
    "For a 50 µl PCR reaction, add 1 µl of template from Step 4.5, 0.5 µl of Herculase II, 0.5 µl of DMSO, 10 µl of 5x buffer, 0.5 µl of dNTP mix, and 1 µl of forward and reverse primer mix.\nUse the following PCR parameters: 98 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 98 °C for 20 sec, 59 °C for 20 sec, 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.\n\tNote: The PCR parameters described here yield specific products for several genes tested. However, these conditions are dependent upon user-chosen genes of interest. PCRs using genomic DNA as template often require optimization to ensure that no extra bands appear. These extra bands can be confused with cleavage products after the T7E1 assay.\nMeasure DNA concentration of the PCR products using a spectrometer at A260.\nAdd 400 ng of PCR products to 2 µl of Digestion buffer 2. Add ddH2O to a final reaction volume of 19 µl. Incubate in boiling water for 5 min. Let the reaction sit on the bench and naturally cool down to RT (45-60 min).\nAdd 1 µl (10 units/µl) of T7E1, incubate at 37 °C for 15 min. Stop the reaction by adding 2 µl of 0.25 M EDTA mixed with 6x DNA Loading Dye.\nDissolve 2.5 g of agarose powder to 100 ml of 1xTAE. Microwave the mixture and pour gel onto a gel box. When gel is formed, load the whole 20 µl reaction to the 2.5% agarose gel. Run the gel at 100-150 V for 30 min.",
    "Inspect the gel under UV light (Figure 3). T7E1 cuts at the mismatched sites. For sgRNAs that have caused non-homologous end joining, the PCR products will show additional fast migrating bands (smaller in size) compared to negative control (described in step 4.3).\nEstimate and rank sgRNA cutting efficiency and insertion and deletion percentage (indel%) by comparing the band density using Image J software.\n\t\nFor each sample that run on the gel, designate the gel bands as uncut band, cut band 1 and cut band 2.\nMeasure the density of each band using ImageJ according to the software handbook.\nCalculate fcut using the following formula: fcut = (cut band 1 + cut band 2) / (uncut band + cut band 1 + cut band 2)\nCalculate Indel% using the following formula: Indel=1- √(1-fcut).\n5. In Silico Prediction of Potential Off-target Sites\nNote: Potential off target sites can be predicted using an online open source tool called CasOT17, which is a Perl based program.\nFor a Windows system, download the CasOT program and the human genome database files to local hard drive.\nPrepare the target file of the designed sgRNA in the FASTA format.\nOpen the file named “casot”. A command window appears. Leave it as is for now.\nOpen the file named “opt-generator” to generate option string. Paste the path and name of the target file into the dialog of “-t” or “-target” option.\nPaste the path of the genome sequence file into the dialog of “-g” or “-genome” option.\nInput values of –s or –seed (default value is 2) and –n or -nonseed (default value is 255). The option string is generated and will appear in the box at the top of the page.\nCopy the option string and paste it into the CasOT command window described in Step 5.3.",
    "Note: It might take 30-90 min to run the CasOT program depending on the options and the computer used. Once completed, a folder named ‘<input_target_file>-<genome_file>-<off-target_related_options>’ will be generated. Two files will be included in the folder, a “.stat” file describing the statistics and a .csv (comma-separated values) file containing the detailed search results.</off-target_related_options></genome_file></input_target_file>\nOpen the .csv file with a spreadsheet program. The following information is provided in the file for every off target site: chromosomal and genomic location, sequence of the site, mismatch (Mm) type, total number of mismatched bases, and exon information relating to the off target site.\nDesign PCR primers for the sites that have <2 Mm in either the seed or the non-seed sequence.\nPerform PCR for selected positive hiPSC clone using the following conditions: 98 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 98 °C for 20 sec, 59 °C for 20 sec, 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.\n\tNote: The PCR parameters described here yield specific products for several genes tested in our lab. However, these conditions are dependent upon user-chosen genes of interest. PCRs using genomic DNA as template often require optimization to ensure that no extra bands appear.\nSequence the PCR products, align sequencing results with predicted sequences and search for mutations. If mutations exist, then off-target events are identified.\n6. Electroporation of hiPSCs to Make Neural Lineage Reporters\nCulture hiPSCs in TeSR-E8 medium on Geltrex coated dishes. Change medium to MEF-CM (Mouse embryonic fibroblasts conditioned medium) medium two days before electroporation. Incubate in 2 ml of Accutase for 5 min and collect cells.",
    "Electroporate hiPSCs with linearized targeting vector, Cas9-003 expression vector, and sgRNA vector using the following conditions: 1 x 107 hiPSCs, co-transfect 2.5 µg of sgRNA, 2.5 µg of Cas9 and 50 µg of targeting vector. For double nickase strategy, add 50 µg of targeting vector, 2.5 µg of each sgRNA (with Cas9n co-expressed by the vector).\nSelect clones by positive and negative selections as described24,25.\nIdentify positive clones by Southern blot analysis or long range genomic PCR24,25.\nSubscription Required.
