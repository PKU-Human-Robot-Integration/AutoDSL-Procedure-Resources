    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nVisualization of LacZ activity in murine embryos\nTiming: 1–2 h\nCollecting mouse embryos\nPrepare the E15.5 pregnant mice.\nEuthanize a pregnant female by cervical dislocation. Make a cut along the ventral midline of the skin and take both sides of uterine horns into the petri-dish containing 1×PBS.\nDissect out each implantation site of uterine horn, and carefully remove uterine muscles and the placenta with forceps.\nTransfer embryos surrounded by amniotic membrane from uterus in petri-dish and take embryos out by gently tearing off the yolk sac. Put embryos in each well of a 24-well plate.\nPour 1 mL of 1×PBS containing Mg2+ into each well and keep on ice until X-gal staining is started.\nNote: Since removal of Mg2+ has been shown to decelerate the enzymatic activity of LacZ, use 1×PBS containing Mg2+ in this step (Sinnott and Withers, 1974[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nNote: The yolk sac can be optionally used for genotyping. If you want to use it for genotyping, do not fix it.\nFixation and X-gal staining\nTiming: 4–14 h\nPut embryos in 1 mL of fixative solution for 2 h at 4°C.\nWash embryos with 1 mL of 1×PBS containing Mg2+ twice.\nTransfer embryos into 1 mL of staining solution and incubate for 2 h at room temperature with gentle shaking using an in vitro shaker in the dark.\nWash embryos with 1 mL of 1×PBS twice.\nIncubate embryos in 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde/1×PBS for 12 h at 4°C.\nNote: Ensure that X-gal activity should be displayed as blue color. If the staining is faint, the incubation time can be prolonged up to 12 hours at room temperature with gentle shaking in the dark.\nOptically clearing of embryos and imaging\nTiming: 4 days–2 weeks\nWash embryos with 1 mL of 1×PBS twice.",
    "Transfer embryos into a 15 mL centrifuge tube, add 10 mL of 50% CUBIC-1, and incubate with gentle shaking at 37°C for 6 h.\nMake sure that the skin of the embryo gets transparent and swollen, then switch to 10 mL of CUBIC-1. Continue incubating with gentle shaking at 37°C.\nChange solution with new 10 mL of CUBIC-1 every second day and continue incubating at 37°C for 14 days until the whole embryo becomes transparent (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1] A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1382-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Appearance of E15.5 embryos after fixation or clearing according to the protocol\n(A) E15.5 embryos are fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde before cleaning (left), 2 days in CUBIC-1 (middle), and after clearing for 14 days (right). Scale bar, 1 mm.\n(B) The final appearance of E15.5 embryos of Ostn+/LacZ fixed with 0.2% glutaraldehyde (left), 1% paraformaldehyde and 0.05% glutaraldehyde (center), and 4% paraformaldehyde (right) for 30 min at 4°C. Note the differences of the LacZ activity in the embryos depending on the fixative conditions. Scale bars, 1 mm. Part of a figure was reused from Watanabe-Takano et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7].\nTransfer embryos into petri-dish and pour enough CUBIC-1 solution to immerse the whole embryo. Acquire images by stereomicroscopy using transmitted illumination.\nCritical: Fixative solution should be made carefully following this protocol. Excess paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde would hamper the original LacZ activity and make embryos yellow, respectively (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B).\nVisualization of LacZ activity in adult mice\nTiming: 4–14 h\nAnesthetizing mice and perfusion of whole mouse body at 8 weeks of age\nPrepare all equipment required for dissection, perfusion, and fixation (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1382-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

    "(B) Shaving the hair of a mouse with an electric clipper.\n(C) Setting the mouse for perfusion by use of the needles.\n(D and E) Cutting diaphragm and exposing the chest cavity. Dotted line indicates the border between diaphragm and chest cavity (D). Black and white arrowheads indicate the right atrium and the left ventricle, respectively (E).\n(F) Starting perfusion with 1×PBS through the left ventricle. Note the liver appears to be whitish (arrowhead).\n(G) Peeling of the skin completely including the tail for X-gal staining.\n(H) Fixing the sample with enough amount of the fixative solution with gentle shaking. Note the sample is completely soaked into the fixative solution.\n(I) Staining the sample with enough amount of staining solution with gentle shaking wrapped with aluminum foil to keep it in the dark.\nPrepare an 8-week-old mouse, measure the body weight of the mouse, and anesthetize the mice by injecting 10 μL/g anesthetic reagent intraperitoneally.\nShave the whole coat of the mouse with an electric clipper (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B).\nNote: Fur contamination would directly spoil the appearance of the sample after clearing. Since it is quite hard to remove fur contamination after cleaning, shave the coat of the mice as well as possible in this step.\nPlace the mouse in a supine position by putting in a pin through each of the paws and sterilize its abdomen with 70 % EtOH (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]C).\nCritical: The final result depends on this setting, so you should carefully set up the position of the mouse in this step.\nExpose internal organs by cutting the skin and dermis.\nChange gently the position of some organs such as the small intestine, the liver, and so on to fully expose the diaphragm (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]D).",
    "Make a small incision in the diaphragm with scissors and carefully cut the boundary between the diaphragm and the chest cavity.\nMake an incision in the right atrium and insert a needle into the left ventricle (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]E).\nNote: Be careful not to break through the left ventricle by your needle, otherwise the whole-body perfusion would not succeed. In addition, please keep the tip of the needle into the left ventricle.\nPerfuse the mouse with more than 25 mL 1×PBS from the left ventricle at a constant flow rate of 5 mL/min. Make sure that the liver of the animal appears pale (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]F).\nFixation and staining of the whole mouse body\nTiming: 2 days\nFix the mouse by perfusing with 25 mL of fixative solution at the same flow rate as that in perfusion.\nNote: Ensure the contracture of hind limb muscles and tail in a few minutes after starting perfusion, which is a sign of success.\nGently remove all the skin from the mouse as well as possible.\nPut the mouse into a plastic bag filled with 150 mL of the fixative solution and sealed the bag by a heat sealer. Make sure that the bubbles are driven out of the bag as possible as you can (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]G).\nIncubate for 45 min with gentle shaking at 4°C (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]H).\nWash with 150 mL of 1×PBS twice and transfer the mouse body into 150 mL of the staining solution.\nIncubate the sample in the plastic bag filled with staining solution for 12–16 h at room temperature in the dark (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]I).\nNote: Make sure that the whole-body of the mouse is completely soaked with enough fixative and staining solutions.\nOptical clearing of the whole mouse body\nTiming: 2 weeks",
    "Wash with 150 mL of 1×PBS twice and fix again with 150 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde/1×PBS at 4°C for 12 h.\nWash with 150 mL of 1×PBS twice and transfer the mouse body into 150 mL of 50 % CUBIC-1 at 37°C for 1 day.\nImmerse the mouse in 150 mL of 100% CUBIC-1 and incubate with gentle shaking at 37°C for 2 days.\nReplace the old medium with new 150 mL of CUBIC-1 every two days and keep incubating at 37°C for 14 days with gentle shaking until the mouse becomes transparent.\nNote: Transparency is confirmed by the decolorization that is caused by heme release from the fixed samples incubated with CUBIC-1 as described previously (Tainaka et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]).\nSample was taken out from the plastic bag and put in the clear plastic case filled with enough CUBIC-1 to immerse the whole-body of the mouse.\nTake photos of samples illuminated by a light box (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1382-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.
