    "hiPSC usage in this protocol was approved by the University of Michigan HPSCRO Committee (Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Oversight Committee). See the Table of Materials for a list of materials and equipment. See Table 1 for media and their compositions.\n1. Thawing and plating commercially available cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs for maturation on a maturation-inducing extracellular matrix (MECM)\nWarm all the reagents to room temperature and rehydrate the MECM plates with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing calcium and magnesium, for 1 h prior to cardiomyocyte plating (200 µL of buffer per well of a 96-well plate).\nWash the MECM plates 2x with HBSS or PBS containing calcium and magnesium for 1 h prior to cardiomyocyte plating (200 µL of buffer per well of a 96-well plate) and keep the wells hydrated.\nPrepare a 37 °C water bath.\nRemove the cardiomyocyte tubes from the liquid nitrogen tank, transfer the tubes to dry ice, and slightly open the tube caps to release pressure.\n\tNOTE: Releasing pressure in the tubes is extremely important! If too much pressure builds inside the tubes, they could explode.\nReseal the tube caps and place them in the water bath to thaw for 4 min.\n\tNOTE: Allow them to thaw completely, to avoid cell damage due to partial thawing.\nAfter the cells thaw, spray the tubes with 70% ethanol before opening. Transfer the cells into 15 mL conical tubes with a 1 mL pipette. Slowly drip 8 mL of plating medium, agitating the tube each time 1 mL is added, to allow the cells to adjust to changes in osmolarity.\n\t\nWash the cryovial with 1 mL of plating medium using a 1 mL glass pipette. Then, slowly drip the wash into the 15 mL conical tube.",
    "Centrifuge the tubes at ~300 × g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1 mL of plating medium. Remove an aliquot and perform live cell counting with a hemocytometer. Add additional plating medium to obtain 7.5 × 105 cells/mL.\n\tNOTE: Approximately 10 mL of cell suspension is required to prepare 96 wells.\nDispense 100 µL of cell suspension per well of an MECM-coated 96-well plate using a multichannel pipette.\n\tNOTE: Make sure to avoid cell precipitation and obtain uniform cell density in all wells while plating.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 days prior to changing the medium to maintenance medium (200 µL/well). Change the maintenance medium on day 5 after thawing. Perform EP assays on day 7 or later, as described previously8,9. Change the medium every other day when opting for extending the cell culture.\n2. hiPSC cardiac-directed differentiation and hiPSC-CM purification\nWarm 1x commercially available ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution, HBSS without calcium and magnesium (HBSS--), and 6-well plates coated with solubilized basement membrane matrix secreted by an Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma cell (mouse ECM) to room temperature.\nMark the differentiated colonies by phase-contrast microscopy and aspirate/ablate. Wash each well with 1 mL of HBSS--. Perform two washes in wells containing >10 differentiation spots.\nAspirate the HBSS-- and add 1 mL of EDTA solution to each well. Incubate the plates for up to 5 min at 37 °C. Check the plates after 3 min and look for translucent white, visible colonies.",
    "Aspirate the EDTA solution and add 1 mL to a single well. Dislodge the cells with 2 mL of hiPSC medium by pipetting the suspension up and down repeatedly, using a 10 mL glass pipette to detach all stem cells from the well, and transfer the cell suspension to a collection tube. Repeat the aspiration and dislodging with subsequent wells.\n\tNOTE: Dislodge hard to lift colonies with the tip of the glass pipette.\nCount the stem cells and adjust the volume to plate 8.0 × 105 cells/well. Culture the cells on hiPSC medium (2 mL/well) until the stem cells reach 90% confluence (this time is referred from now on as D0).\nPrepare 2 mL of basal differentiation medium supplemented with 4 µM of CHIR99021.\nOn D0, wash each well of a 6-well plate of stem cells with 1 mL of HBSS per well. Replace the HBSS with basal differentiation medium supplemented with 4 µM of CHIR99021.\nOn D1, do nothing.\nOn D2, prepare basal differentiation medium supplemented with 4 µM of IWP4.\nReplace the medium with 2 mL of IWP4-supplemented basal differentiation medium per well.\nOn D3, do nothing for a ventricular-specific differentiation. For an atrial-specific differentiation, aspirate the medium and add 2 mL of basal medium supplemented with 4 µM of IWP4 and 1 µM retinoic acid (RA) solution per well.\nOn D4, aspirate the medium and add 2 mL of basal medium per well for ventricular differentiation. For an atrial differentiation, aspirate the medium and add 2 mL of basal medium supplemented with 1 µM RA solution per well.\nOn D5, do nothing.\nOn D6, aspirate the medium and add 2 mL of basal medium per well (for both atrial and ventricular differentiation).\nOn D7, do nothing.",
    "On D8, aspirate the medium and add 2 mL of cardiomyocyte maintenance medium. Change the medium every other day until cell separation, or follow a chronic drug exposure plan.\n3. hiPSC-CM purification via MACS (magnetic-activated cell sorting)\nAspirate the cell culture medium and wash each well with 1 mL of HBSS--. Dissociate the cells by adding 1 mL of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and incubating at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 10 min. Resuspend and singularize the cells in each well with 2 mL of plating medium to inactivate the trypsin/EDTA.\nCollect the cells from the six wells into a 50 mL conical tube with a 70 µm strainer. Then, wash the strainer with 3 mL of plating medium. Count the cells.\nCentrifuge the suspension at ~300 × g for 5 min. Aspirate the supernatant and wash the cells with 20 mL of ice-cold MACS separation buffer. Then, centrifuge again at ~300 × g for 5 min.\nResuspend the pellet in 80 µL of cold MACS separation buffer per 5 × 106 cells. Add 20 µL of cold non-cardiomyocyte depletion cocktail (human) per 5 × 106 cells. Gently mix the cell suspension and incubate on ice for 10 min.\nWash the sample by adding 4 mL of cold MACS separation buffer per 5 × 106 cells. Centrifuge the sample at ~300 × g for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 80 µL of cold MACS separation buffer per 5 × 106 cells. Add 20 µL of cold anti-biotin microbeads per 5 × 106 cells. Gently mix the cell suspension and incubate for 10 min on ice.",
    "While the samples are incubating, place the positive depletion columns (fitted with the 30 µm pre-separation filters) on the MACS separator, and place the labeled 15 mL collection tubes below the columns. One column is needed for every 5 × 106 cells.\nPrime each column with 3 mL of cold MACS separation buffer. Mix the antibody-treated cell suspension with 2 mL of MACS separation buffer per 5 × 106 cells, and add to the column.\n\tNOTE: Do not centrifuge! Centrifugation at this step has detrimental effects on cardiomyocyte yield.\nAdd 2 mL of MACS separation buffer to each column, and collect the flowthrough until 12 mL of flowthrough cardiomyocyte suspension is collected.\n\tNOTE: Never allow the columns to fully dry.\nCentrifuge the cardiomyocytes at ~300 × g for 5 min, discard the supernatant, and suspend the cardiomyocytes in 1 mL of plating medium.\nCount the cells to determine the concentration, adjust the volume to the desired seeding density, and plate the cells. Plate the purified cardiomyocytes on the MECM 96-well plates, as described above in steps 1.9-1.11 (7.5 × 105 cells/well).\n4. Optical mapping using voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) and calcium-sensitive fluorophores (CSFs)\nPrepare the appropriate amount of VSD in HBSS with calcium and magnesium, by adding 1 µL of VSD dye per mL of HBSS and 10 µL of loading adjuvant per mL of HBSS.\n\tNOTE: Typically, a 96-well plate requires 10 mL of VSD solution.\nAlternatively, prepare HBSS with calcium and magnesium supplemented with 5 µM of CSF. Aspirate the cardiomyocyte maintenance medium and replace with 100 µL of VSD or CSF per well of a 96-well plate. Incubate the cells for 30 min in the cell culture incubator.",
    "Remove the dyes and replace with assay medium or HBSS. Equilibrate at 37 °C for the acquisition of baseline data optical mapping with a high-throughput optical mapping device.\nTreat the cells with drugs for acute exposure testing, or map the cells that were chronically exposed to drugs of interest.\nFor cardiotoxicity testing in 96-well plates, use four doses of a compound with at least six wells per dose. Use doses ranging from below to above the effective therapeutic plasma concentration, including a dose of the clinical effective therapeutic plasma concentration.\nDilute the drugs in dimethyl sulfoxide, store them as stock solutions at -20 °C, and then dilute them in HBSS to the desired concentrations.\nMake baseline electrophysiology measurements prior to drug application, as described in section 5. Once the drugs have been applied, make electrophysiology recordings at least 30 min later for chronic studies. See the following sections for optical mapping data acquisition and analysis procedures.\n5. Optical mapping using genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECI)\nPlate commercially available or MACS-purified hiPSC-CMs, as described above, using MECM-coated 96-well plates to make mature hiPSC-CMs. To form confluent monolayers, plate 7.5 × 104 CMs per well of each 96-well plate. Use plating medium.\nAfter 48 h in plating medium, switch to cardiomyocyte maintenance medium.\nOn day 4 after thawing and replating, add recombinant adenovirus for expressing GCaMP6m (AdGCaMP6m) to cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 5. Add the virus using CM assay medium.\n\tNOTE: Here, experiments using GCaMP6m were performed in iCell2 cardiomyocytes from a commercial vendor.\nOn day 5, remove the adGCaMP6m medium and replace with fresh RPMI+B27 (cardiomyocyte maintenance medium).\nOn day 7, observe the CMs using microscopy or the optical mapping imager, to visualize spontaneous contractions and corresponding calcium transients.",
    "On day 7 or later, for medication screening, directly transfer 96-well plates of mature hiPSC-CM monolayers expressing GCaMP6m to the optical mapping imager from the incubator for baseline data acquisition.\nFollowing electrophysiology data acquisition, return the plates of the CMs to the tissue culture incubator, for measurements on a subsequent time point.\nFollowing baseline recordings, apply the medications, using at least four doses of each medication and at least six wells per dose. Equilibrate the medications on the cells for at least 30 min prior to data collection. Warm the well temperature to ~37 °C prior to and during the acquisition of data.\nFollowing baseline recordings of an entire plate, add isoproterenol (500 nM) to every well to enable robust drug response data. Quantify the effects of isoproterenol on monolayer beat rate, contraction amplitude (calcium transient amplitude), and calcium transient duration (see Figure 6), as described in section 5.\n6. Acquisition of optical mapping data and analysis\nMake sure that the optical mapping device camera, transilluminator, and plate heater are turned on.\nOpen the acquisition software and determine the file saving location.\nOpen the front drawer and position the plate on the plate heater.\nAcquire a dark frame by clicking on the Dark Frame button.\nSelect Duration (10-30 s) and Frame Rate of Acquisition (e.g., 100 fps; 250 fps for higher temporal resolution), and click Start Acquisition.\nOpen the analysis software and, in the Import/Filter tab, select either Browse for a single file or Tile Multiple to reconstruct a plate.\nSelect Parameter Mode (APD or CaTD), enter Distance per Pixel, and use the Well Wizard to determine the wells' location in the image. Click Process Save to move to the next tab.",
    "Open the ROIs (regions of interest) tab and choose to draw the ROIs Manually, Automatically, or Not Use ROIs at all, which would then consider the whole well for analysis. After the ROIs have been selected, click the Process/Save button to move to the next step. Check the Hide Wells and Only Show Filtered boxes to visualize the ROIs.\nOpen the Analysis tab and, on the top right side of the screen, select each Well or ROI to confirm the Accuracy of Automatic Beat Detection. Add or Remove Beats from the traces by pressing Add Beat/ Save Beats, or by selecting an Individual Beat and pressing Delete on the keyboard.\nOptionally, use the Average Heat Maps feature to create heatmaps of selected parameters for the plate.\nClick on the Time-Space Plot button in the Analysis tab to visualize data for each well or the ROI. After making sure that the beat detection is accurate, proceed to the Export tab and select File Format. Press Export and create a folder for the data to be exported to. Proceed to open data files and run the chosen statistical analysis routine.\n\tNOTE: .xlxs files are preferred as all the parameters are exported in a single file; other formats (.csv or .tsv) generate one file per parameter.\nSubscription Required.
