    "Animal care was in accordance with the Université de Sherbrooke animal care and use committee.\n1. Tube Preparation\nThe day before cell sorting, add 1-2 ml of heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) to 5 ml polypropylene round bottom tubes, and to 15 ml and 50 ml polypropylene conical tubes.\n\tCritical step: Ensure that every tube used in the protocol is coated.\n\tNote: FBS coating prevents germ cells from sticking to tube walls.\nSlowly mix O/N by inversion at 4 °C to coat the tubes uniformly using a rotator.\nThe next day, remove FBS from coated tubes by decanting.\n\t\n*Critical step: Ensure that the 5 ml polypropylene round bottom tubes and the 15 and 50 ml tubes used for cell preparation (protocol steps 2.1 to 2.11) are completely emptied of FBS to prevent fanning (i.e., imprecise deviation of the side streams). Use a P200 pipet to remove the FBS.\n\t\tNote: Residual FBS in tubes prior to sorting may lead to a loss of cells or contamination of other tubes used during cell sorting, \nLeave a small residual volume of FBS (about 100-200 µl) in the 5 ml polypropylene round bottom tubes used for collecting purified cells.\n2. Cell Preparation\nSacrifice one male mouse under anesthesia using O2/isoflurane (induction at 5% then maintained at 2%) followed by CO2 asphyxiation.\nExcise and decapsulate both testes and mince with small scissors in 500 µl of sorting buffer into a 1.5 ml tube.\nFlush germ cells from seminiferous tubules by gentle up and down pipetting in the 1.5 ml tube, first with a truncated 100-1,000 µl tip, and then with an intact 100-1,000 µl tip.\nRemove debris and clumps by one filtration step using a 40 µm cell strainer and collect filtrate into the 50 ml conical tube previously coated with FBS in step 1.",
    "Wash the filter once with sorting buffer up to a total volume of 3 ml and transfer filtrate into the 15 ml conical tube previously coated in step 1.\nAdd 16 µl of 50 mM EDTA pH 8 per milliliter of cell suspension (48 µl for 3 ml) so as to obtain a final concentration of 0.8 mM EDTA.\nTo fix germ cells, slowly add 3 volumes of ice-cold 100% ethanol using a 10 ml pipet with gentle agitation (vortex at low speed), which will produce a milky suspension.\n\tCritical step: Slowly adding ethanol is crucial and important to preserve the integrity of the cell preparation. We noted that rapid addition of ethanol causes cell lysis resulting in a major decrease of sorting efficiency. For a 3 ml cell suspension, 9 ml of ethanol should be added in approximately 1 min.\nIncubate cells on ice for 15 min with occasional mixing by inversion.\nCentrifuge cell suspension at 800 x g for 5 min and remove the clear supernatant.\nGently resuspend the fixed germ cells in 2 ml of sorting buffer.\nAdd 4 µl of SYTO16 DNA dye (1 mM solution in DMSO) and incubate for at least 30 min (protected from light).\n\tNote: Best sorting results are obtained using SYTO16 since it is a permeable DNA dye that is easily incorporated into the highly compacted nuclei of spermatids.\n3. Cell Sorter Set Up\nNote: Here, a 4-Laser (405 nm - violet, 488 nm - blue, 561 nm - yellow-green, 633 nm - red) 20-parameter BDFACSAria III cell sorter is used. The BD FACSDiva 6.1.3 software is used to visualize and analyze the data. The settings may vary depending on the type of sorter used.",
    "Sterilize the FACS sorter by running 70% ethanol as sheath fluid during the fluidics shutdown procedure (\"Cytometer\" menu in the software) prior to sorting. Select \"Cytometer\" in the toolbar of the software and choose \"Fluidic shutdown\". Follow the steps mentioned by the processes.\nPrepare and filter 1x PBS with a 0.22 µm filter so as to eliminate any crystals and contaminants. Fill the sheath tank to the upper weld line on the inside of the tank.\nStart the software and log in. Start the FACS sorter to warm up the lasers for at least 30 min prior to sorting. Run two fluidic startup processes to flush out the ethanol from the fluidics. Select \"Cytometer\" in the toolbar of the software and choose \"Fluidic startup\". Follow the steps mentioned by the processes.\n\tNote: This restores fluidics with normal sheath fluid (1x PBS).\nClean the sorting block and the deflection plates with distilled water and dry them thoroughly. Sonicate a 100 µm nozzle placed in a tube of distilled water for 2 min in a sonication bath. Wipe the nozzle thoroughly.\nInsert the 100 µm nozzle into the flow cell and turn the nozzle-locking lever clockwise to the 12 hr position. Set the sheath pressure to 20 psi.\nTurn on the stream and adjust the amplitude to obtain target values for frequency (around 30), Drop 1 (around 150) and Gap (around 12) and to establish a stable droplet breakoff pattern (few satellite drops). Turn off attenuation.\nMake sure that the stream is straight and hits the center of the waste aspirator by changing the angle of the sort block. Note: A 130 µm nozzle at 10 psi was also tested and no obvious difference was found.",
    "Set laser delay to 0 for the blue, -77.39 for the red, 37.33 for the violet and -39.85 for the yellow-green lasers.\nSet areas scaling to 1.14 for the blue, 1.0 for the red, 0.75 for the violet and 0.96 for the yellow-green lasers.\nUsing a Test Sort (in the \"Side Stream\" window of the software), make sure that side streams are not fanning. In the \"Side Stream\" window, adjust the voltage sliders of each side stream so that they hit the middle of test collection tube. If the center stream is not tight, adjust the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th drop settings to constrain the center stream.\nStart the Cytometer Setup and Tracking (CS&T) application in the software (\"Cytometer\" menu).\nUse the cytometer setup and tracking beads at 1 drop per 350 µl to automate the characterization and tracking of the cytometer performance using manufacturer's instructions.\nQuit the CS&T application. Apply CS&T setting, make sure the stream parameters still allow a stable droplet breakoff pattern, and turn on the Sweet Spot button as described in manufacturer's instructions (in the \"Breakoff window\").\nOptimize the Drop Delay value using fluorescent beads (see Table of Materials).\n\t\nInstall the collection tubes in the holder. Open the sort block door. In the \"Side Stream\" window, turn on voltage then select \"Test sort\" and click the Aspirator Drawer button to open the drawer and have access to the collection tubes.\nOptimize the side streams so they go into the center of the tube. Adjust values and sliders as needed.\nClose the sort block door and make sure to adjust the micrometer dial to obtain the brightest bead spot at the center. Unselect waste drawer, test sort and voltage. Remove the collection tubes.\nOptimize the drop delay according to manufacturers' instructions.",
    "Briefly, shake bead vial vigorously and dilute 1 drop of beads in 0.5 ml of PBS.\nUsing manufacturers' instructions, set the drop delay using the Drop Delay experiment template available in the software. Alternatively, use the Auto Drop Delay feature to set the drop delay.\nLoad the tube of fluorescent beads and adjust the flow rate until the threshold rate is ~3,000 to 4,000 events/second. Set the sort precision to \"Initial\" and finally to \"Fine tune\" in the \"Sort layout\" window. Select the optical filter and sort beads. Adjust the Drop Delay until ~100% are sorted to the left.\n\t\t\tNote: This step is critical to make sure that cells of interest sort into a side stream. The beads and the optical filter are used to achieve close to a 100% droplet deviation. \nPlace a FSC 1.5 ND (neutral density) filter at the left end of the FSC detector block. Set the window extension to 2.00 µs and the FSC Area scaling to 1.00 (in the \"Laser\" tab in the \"Cytometer\" window).\nBefore loading sample tube, place a sample filter line of 50 µm at the end of the sample line to avoid clumping. To do so, select \"Change Sample Filter\" in the \"Cytometer\" menu.\nTest the composition of the sample fluid to achieve good separation without fanning between side stream and to prevent the cells from sticking to the polypropylene tubes.\n\t\nLoad the sample tube, turn on the deflection plates and select \"Test sort\" with the drawer closed. Look at side streams if separation occurs without too much fanning.\n\t\tNote: Fanning is likely due to a high protein concentration in the sample buffer.",
    "Load the sample tube into the FACS instrument. Select a sample agitation of 300 rpm and a sample temperature of 4 °C. Select \"Acquire Data\" in the \"Acquisition Dashboard\".\nIf necessary, dilute the sample to achieve an appropriate event rate to a maximum of 5,000 events/sec (at a maximum flow rate of 3.0). Strictly respect these limits so as to maintain the purity of the sorted cells.\nTo analyze and sort the cells, optimize the FSC threshold value to eliminate debris without interfering with the population of interest. In logarithmic scale, adjust the voltage of the photo-multiplier tube (PMT) detector with the 530/30 filter in order to make sure that the fluorescence signal of the total population fits within the scale, and gate on the positive population (Figure 1, Gate 1).\nProduce a Forward Scatter-area (FSC-A)/Side Scatter-area (SSC-A) plot of the SYTO16 positive population and adjust the FSC-A to around 110 V in linear scale, and the SSC-A to around 150 V in logarithmic scale to visualize all the events while excluding very large cells and cell aggregates.\nIn the \"Sort Layout\" window, set the \"Sort Precision Mode\" to \"4-way purity\" (Yield mask: 0, Purity Mask: 32, Phase Mask: 0). Select \"Continuous\" from the \"Target Events\" menu for continuous sorting.\nAdd populations to sort in the field corresponding to the tubes (in the \"Sort Layout\" window). Place populations with higher frequencies in the middle and those with lower frequencies at the ends. Set the voltage plates to 2,500 V. During sorting, keep the sample collection tubes on ice.    \n4. Cell Sorting\nImmediately before sorting, filter cells using a 50 µm filter in a previously coated 5 ml polypropylene round bottom tube.\nWash the filter extensively with 1-2 ml of sorting buffer.",
    "Sort fixed germ cells using a 488 nm laser-equipped cell sorter following the gating scheme detailed in Figure 1. Collect purified fractions in 5 ml polypropylene round bottom tubes previously coated in section 1 on ice.\n\t\nMake sure that 100-200 µl of FBS is kept in the collection tubes to avoid sticking of the sorted cells to the tube wall.\nMake sure that the concentration of SYTO16 is saturating to avoid fluorescence fluctuations during the sorting period. SYTO16 is saturating when there is no further variation of cell staining intensity at the Alexa Fluor 488 parameter (DNA staining) in the sorting graphics. If necessary, add 1 µl of SYTO16 to the sorting tube to reach saturation.\nDisplay the total events on a graphic displaying the following parameters: number of events vs Alexa Fluor 488-A.\nSelect the positive DNA staining cells with Gate 1, as shown in Figure 1.\n\t\t\nDisplay cells from gate 1 on a graphic using SSC-A vs FSC-A as parameters\n\t\t\t\nSelect the cells with Gate 2, as showed in Figure 1.\nDisplay cells from Gate 2 on a graphic using FSC-A vs Alexa Fluor 488-A as parameters.\nSelect cells with Gate 5 and Gate 6 on Gate 2 graphic, as showed in Figure 1.\nDisplay separately Gate 5 and Gate 6 on graphics using Alexa Fluor 488-W vs Alexa Fluor 488-A as parameters.\nSelect spermiogenesis steps 1-9 spermatids on the Gate 5 graphic and spermiogenesis steps 10-12 spermatids on the Gate 6 graphics, as showed in Figure 1.\nDisplay cells from gate 1 on a graphic using FSC-A vs Alexa Fluor 488-A as parameters\n\t\t\t\nSelect cells with Gate 3 and Gate 4, as showed in Figure 1.\nDisplay separately Gate 3 and Gate 4 on graphics using Alexa Fluor 488-W vs Alexa Fluor 488-A as parameters.",
