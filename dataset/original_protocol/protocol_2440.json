    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nWe generally perform this method with patient derived oral tumor tissues and oral cancer cell lines. However, this protocol may be compatible with other types of solid tumors and primary cells with simple modifications.\nCollagen coating of culture dishes\nTiming: 1 h\nTo culture the dissociated tumor tissues, we have used collagen coated cell culture surfaces. The following method is used for coating the surface of cell culture dishes with collagen-I.\nDilute collagen-I (stock 3 mg/mL) in PBS to 50 μg/mL for the required volume to cover the surface of the dish (for each 10 cm dishes we use 5 mL of collagen coating solution).\nIncubate dishes at 37°C sterile incubator for 30 min.\nAspirate collagen solution and wash the coated surface twice with PBS.\nAir dry the dishes/plates in the bio-safety cabinet.\nSeal the unused plate/dishes and store at 4°C for later use.\nTumor dissociation\nTiming: 2 h\nThe following section will accomplish collection and transportation of tumor samples to the lab, dissociation of tumor to partially digested tissues for explant cultures as well as single cell preparation for flow-cytometry.\nTransport samples to the lab in freshly prepared tissue transport media (prepared fresh and did not store) under chilled condition using frozen gel packs.\nWash tumor sample pieces with PBS containing 2× Gentamicin, 2× antibiotic-antimycotic mix (Penicillin, Streptomycin, Amphotericin B - mix) with gentle rocking for five minutes followed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 s.\nWash the sample with ACK lysis buffer at room-temperature (24°C–27°C) for two minutes with gentle rocking, and centrifuge at 500 × g for 10 s.\nWash twice with chilled PBS containing 2× Gentamicin, 2× antibiotic-antimycotic mix. Centrifuge at 500 × g for 10 s.\nTransfer in chilled tissue transport media. Keep it on ice.",
    "Put a cell culture dish on ice and transfer the sample in the dish in 500 μL tissue transport media.\nMince the sample into fine pieces, using a surgical blade.\nNote: This minced tissue slurry should be pipettable with 2 mL pipette.\nCollect the samples and resuspend in 5 mL of tissue dissociation media (prepared fresh and did not store).\nTransfer the tissue suspension in a 15 mL tube and put in a rack, placed in a 37°C water bath.\nDigest the samples for 60 min with mixing by pipetting up and down by 2 mL serological pipette with gentle pressure against the bottom of the tube for 5 times in every 15 min.\nNote: Keep monitoring the process of tissue digestion by taking a small portion of samples over the glass slide and checking under the microscope. Digesting tumor pieces should not remain bigger than 200–300 micron in size.\nSpin at 500 × g for 10 s.\nNote: This will allow undigested tissue samples to get sedimented in bottom of the tube and digested single cells will remain in suspension.\nCollect all the cells in suspension in a fresh tube (Tube A).\nWash the pellet once by adding 1 mL tissue transport media and centrifuging at 500 × g for 10 s.\nCollect all the cells in suspension and add them to ‘Tube A’.\nNote: This tube contains fully digested single-cell suspension of the tissue.\nPellet contains partially digested tumor pieces.\nResuspend the tumor pieces in 1 mL of tissue transport media.\nTransfer 250 μL of suspension with these partially digested tissue pieces to a fresh tube and label the tube as ‘Tube B’.\nSet aside on ice for explant culture, as mentioned later.\nPellet the remaining partially digested tissue and add 1 mL of tissue dissociation media.",
    "Incubate for 10–15 min at 37°C.\nPipette up and down the tissue slurry for 5 times, and check for dissociation.\nPellet down all indigestible tissue parts at 500 × g for 5 min.\nCollect all the cells in suspension and transfer to ‘Tube A’.\nProcessing of cell suspension (tube A) for flow cytometry\nPass the cell suspension through a 40 μm cell strainer, and spin at 500 × g for 5 min.\nAdd 200 μL of ACK lysis buffer to the pellet and gently rock the pellet for 1 min.\nPellet down the cells by centrifuging at 500 × g for 3 min. Remove buffer.\nWash cell pellets with freshly prepared chilled HBSS(+) buffer twice and again resuspend the cells in chilled HBSS(+) buffer.\nPrepared HBSS(+) buffer can be stored at 4°C for 15 days.\nKeep the tube on ice.\nCount the cells with trypan blue and proceed for flow-cytometry, as mentioned below.\nFlow cytometry\nTiming: 2 h\nThe following section will accomplish the sample preparation for flow-cytometry, acquisition of data and data analysis for detection and quantification of putative oral-SLCCs and its hybrid states.\nAldefluor assay and antibody-based phenotyping\nThe ALDEFLUOR™ reagent is a proprietary item of STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada. This is provided in an inactive and stable form (BODIPY- aminoacetaldehyde-diethyl acetate, BAAA-DA). The dry ALDEFLUOR™ reagent needs to be dissolved in DMSO, converted to the fluorescent-activated ALDEFLUOR™ reagent (BAAA) by treatment with 2 N HCl and diluted with ALDEFLUOR™ assay buffer as per the instructions provided by the manufacturer (link here[href=https://www.stemcell.com/products/brands/aldefluor-aldh-assay.html]). Aliquot the activated ALDEFLUOR reagent and store at −20°C.\nNote: Always keep reagents on ice and away from light, while using.\nCell sample preparation",
    "Count cells in ‘Tube A’ and take the required volume of cell suspension (approximately 2 × 106 cells) in a 15 mL tube after calculations.\nNote: This 2 × 106 cells is the count of large cells in digested cell suspension of tumors. Very small lymphocytes are not included in this count or in further calculations. We generally have observed that contaminating lymphocytes contribute to 30%–50% of total cells.\nPellet down the cells (at 400 × g for 5 min) and resuspend in 2 mL of ALDEFLUOR™ assay buffer at the dilution of 1 × 106 cells in 1 mL of assay buffer.\nTake two separate 1.5 mL tubes and label them as ‘unstained’ and ‘control’.\nNote: The control tube serves as a negative control for ALDEFLUOR Assay as well as negative control of antibody staining (isotype-antibody staining).\nAdd 500 μL of cell suspension in unstained and negative control tubes. Remaining 1.0 mL cell suspension tube is labeled as ‘Test’.\nIn the control tube, add 5 μL of N,N-diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) (5 μL of DEAB /500 μL of cell suspension).\nRecap the DEAB container, immediately.\nCritical: Preincubate all the tubes from steps 33 and 34 at 37°C for 10 min, before advancing to further steps.\nNext, add 2.5 μL of activated ALDEFLUOR reagent in the ‘Control’ tube and 5 μL in ‘Test’ tubes, under dark condition.\nCritical: Enzymatic reaction begins immediately after addition of activated substrate to the cell suspension. Thus, reagent should be added to the DEAB - control tube without any delay.\nNote: Use a separate tip for dispensing reagent in each tube.\nMix by inverting the tubes 5 times.\nIncubate all tubes for 1 h at 37°C in a water bath.\nAfter incubation, transfer all tubes to ice.\nCentrifuge the tubes for 5 min at 400 × g.",
    "Discard the supernatant and resuspend cell pellets in ice cold ALDEFLUOR™ assay buffer for immunophenotyping at the dilution of 1 × 106 cells per 100 μL.\nCritical: Before proceeding to next step, perform Fc receptor blocking using Human BD Fc Block antibody as per the manufacturer’s protocol (link here[href=https://www.bdbiosciences.com/en-eu/products/reagents/flow-cytometry-reagents/research-reagents/single-color-antibodies-ruo/human-bd-fc-block.564219]) to avoid non-specific false-positive binding of antibody.\nAdd APC-conjugated lineage antibody cocktail (in 1:5 dilution), APC-conjugated human CD31 antibody (in 1:20 dilution), BV421-conjugated Human CD24 antibody (in 1:20 dilution) and BV786-conjugated Human CD44 antibody (in 1:20 dilution) in the ‘Test’ tube. Add isotype control antibody in the DEAB-Control tube.\nIncubate tubes for 30 min at 4°C (in the dark).\nAfter incubation, wash the cells twice with the ice-cold ALDEFLUOR™ assay buffer and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min.\nPass cell suspension through 40 μm cell strainer and collect the flow through, to avoid any cell clump.\nAdd propidium iodide at final concentration of 2 μg/mL and incubate for 5 min.\nNote: Propidium iodide is added to exclude all dead cells at the time of analysis. No need to wash propidium iodide for subsequent steps.\nNote: These prepared tubes can be stored only for short period of time (1 h) at 4°C in dark until they are used for flow-cytometry analysis; otherwise analyze immediately.\nNote: For cell sorting purpose, collection buffer may be made by adding 5% FBS in HBSS (+) tubes and stored at 4°C, beforehand. Collect sorted cells into appropriately labeled tubes containing collection buffer.\nPhenotype analysis of CD24, CD44, and ALDH-high cells by BD FACS Aria-Fusion flow cytometer\nSet the gates using the strategy as shown below in Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2074-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. CD24, CD44, and ALDH expression in oral tumors\n(A) Gating strategy has been shown.",
    "(B) (i) Gate 1 shows all intact cells with high-FSC and SCC parameters. Cell debris with low-FSC and SCC as well as aggregates/ large cells with very high FSC and/or SCC values were excluded. B (ii, iii) Gate 2 and 3 were made to include only singlet cell population. B (iv) Live cells were included for analysis by drawing a viable gate for propidium iodide negative population.\n(C) Using DEAB-control and isotype control antibody, gates for lineage negative as in C (i), CD24/CD44 negative as in C (ii) and ALDH-Low as in C (iii) population is shown.\n(D) APC-conjugated lineage antibody cocktail mixed with CD31-APC was used to separate lineage marker-positive and CD31-positive cells. Lineage antibody-negative gate was drawn for including and analyzing lineage marker and CD31-negative tumor cells (D-i). From this gate, cells populated in respective gates are shown for CD24/CD44 expression (D-ii), ALHD-High and Low (D-iii) and CD24/CD44 expressing cells with ALDH-High phenotype (D-iv).\nSet forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) dot plot for excluding debris and clumped cells (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B-i, ii, iii).\nUse unstained cells to set the appropriate voltages for FSC, SSC, and viability (propidium iodide fluorescence) parameters (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B-iv).\nUse DEAB-‘control’ to set the appropriate voltages for background fluorescence parameters for APC, BV421, BV786, and Aldefluor fluorescence (ALDH) (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]C- i, ii, iii, respectively).\nQuantify cell populations (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]D- i, ii, iii, iv).\nNote: For flow-cytometry-based phenotyping, configuration of the instrument must be checked. The combination of fluorochrome used by us did not require any compensation to be performed. Therefore, this combination allows you to avoid compensation controls.\nEstablishment of primary cultures from tissue explants (TUBE B)\nTiming: 12–20 weeks",
    "The following section describes the method for development of pure cultures of cancer cells along with elimination of contaminating fibroblasts growth in primary explant cultures from partially digested oral tumor tissue explants.\nPlace a few partially digested tissue-explants in 20–30 μL volume as droplets over collagen-coated cell culture plates in tissue explant culture media.\nMedia may be stored at 4°C for maximum of 15 days after preparation.\nIt takes a few hours for tissue to get attached to the coated surface. Make sure that the media is not dried-up. Monitoring every hour under microscope is necessary.\nAfter attachment, add extra media just enough to cover the whole surface.\nNote: An outgrowth of cells can be started from the attached tissue explants. The originated cells are mostly spindle-shaped fibroblast and other irregular or star-shaped epithelial cells.\nMedia should be refreshed twice a week.\nOnce the outgrowth of cells reaches confluency, passage the cells.\nFor passaging of the cells, aspirate the media gently without disturbing the attached tissue explant. Wash twice with PBS.\nAdd 1 mL, 37°C pre-warmed trypsin.\nKeep monitoring cell detachment under the microscope.\nAdd serum-containing media to neutralize trypsin.\nNote: Due to this partial trypsinization, the fibroblast cells come off the plate earlier than the growing epithelial cells.\nCollect the detached cells and grow separately in a fresh well of multi-well plate.\nAdd fresh tissue explant culture media in the plate containing explants and allow it to grow.\nRepeat steps 56–59 of partial trypsinization to collect all outgrowing cells from the tissue explants unless the tissue is exhausted or detached, in 4–8 weeks.\nTo enrich epithelial cells, keep repeating partial trypsinization until the epithelial cells outgrow and become major population in the plate.\nThis may take 8–12 weeks.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2074-Fig2.jpg",
    "Figure 2. Removal of fibroblasts from growing mixed cultures results in vacuolization in cancer cells\nPink arrow pointing a cell having multiple vacuoles and green arrow pointing on floating dead cells.\nNote: Outgrowing cells from tissue explants are initially mixed cultures of epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Presence of these fibroblasts is beneficial for the epithelial cells to survive and adapt.\nAlternatives: Enriching epithelial cells can be maintained separately in complete DMEM-F12K medium or in complete EpiLife medium with low serum.\nNote: These enriched epithelial cells are ready to be cryopreserved and sub-culturing as cell lines. Please see the critical points and notes below.\nCritical: During cell culture establishment, there is a major threat of microbial contamination present in the oral cavity of the patient tumor tissues. Thus, washing with antibiotic mix is the most critical step. Therefore, tissue explants are initially grown with a higher dose of antibiotic-antimycotic mix.\nCritical: Removal of fibroblasts from the mixed culture after partial trypsinization is often associated with stress in cancer cells and loss of growth (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). Therefore, it is critical to monitor cell morphology and symptoms of stress (including vacuolization, floating cells) in growing epithelial cells. Re-introduction of fibroblasts or keeping the mixed culture for a longer period of time may be required under this situation. Also, check the troubleshooting[href=https://www.wicell.org#troubleshooting] section for other important points.\nNote: Once the cell line has been established, the STR profiling can be done on a specific interval to authenticate the origin of the cell lines. Purity of the established cell cultures can be characterized by flow-cytometry using marker for epithelial cells (EpCAM+) and fibroblasts (CD90+) or any other assay dependent markers.\nCell culture and passaging\nTiming: 5 days",
    "The following section will accomplish the maintenance of established cell lines in cultures and its cryopreservation for future usage.\nCell Culture.\nTransfer the cryovials containing frozen cells from liquid nitrogen to a 37°C water bath.\nOnce thawed, transfer cells gently to 10 mL of plain medium in a 15 mL tube to dilute DMSO.\nCentrifuge at 400 × g for 3 min.\nDiscard supernatant and resuspend in 1 mL of prewarmed complete media.\nPre-lay 2 mL of pre-warmed complete media into a 60 mm dish and transfer cells in a 60 mm dish having 2 mL prewarmed complete media.\nAny complete cell culture media (complete DMEM/F12K or EpiLife media) may be stored at 4°C for maximum of 15 days after preparation.\nPlace the plate in a 37°C incubator with 5% CO2.\nSub-culturing.\nAfter 48 h of cell plating, remove media and rinse adhered cells with 2 mL of PBS to remove excess media and FBS.\nNote: This process can be repeated twice, in case of strongly adherent cell lines.\nAdd 500 μL of room-temperature (24°C–27°C) 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA, and incubate for 5–6 min in the incubator at 37°C.\nAdd 1 mL of Trypsin neutralizer to the detached cell suspension.\nCollect cells in a tube and spin at 400 × g for 3 min at room-temperature (24°C–27°C).\nDiscard the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL of complete media.\nCount cells and plate at desired cell density for further usage.\nNote: We prefer to revive cells in 60 mm dishes. Though for expansion, cells can be seeded in a bigger surface dish or flask. For sub-cultures we regularly seed 3 × 105–4 × 105 cells in a 60 mm dish. Cell culture medium is stored at 4°C for a maximum of 45 days. Media is pre-warmed to 37°C before using.",
    "Critical: Dead cells should be removed from the culture. If observed in higher number, PBS wash may be given once before adding fresh media. 3% sodium bicarbonate may be added in the media for fast proliferating cells to have better buffering ability of media for pH changes.\nCryopreservation.\nResuspend 1 × 106 cells in 1 mL of freshly prepared chilled cryopreservation media.\nCryopreservation media may be stored at 4°C for maximum of 15 days after preparation.\nTransfer cells-containing media in a cryovial.\nPlace cryovial in a Cryochill 1 degree cooler and keep it at −80°C for 1 day.\nTransfer frozen cell cryovials into liquid nitrogen.\nPrimary spheroid formation from patient-derived cell lines\nTiming: 1 h\nThe following section will accomplish the growth of 3D-spheroids from established cell lines.\nTrypsinize cells as described in the previous section, and make single cell suspension in complete media.\nSuspend cell suspension at 1 × 105 cells per mL in plain media without FBS. Keep cell suspension on ice.\nTake required cells to make cell suspension of 3,000–5,000 cells per mL in spheroid growth culture media containing 1× growth factor supplementation.\nNote: Try to make spheroid growth culture media and 5× growth factor supplements, freshly before use. Can be stored up to 2 weeks at 4°C.\nMix ice thawed Geltrex at final concentration of 1.25% to cell suspension followed by vortexing for 5–10 s.\nCritical: Geltrex is a commercially available basement membrane matrix. It is aliquoted and stored at −20°C and forms a gel at room-temperature (24°C–27°C) or higher. Therefore, it requires thawing on ice. Complete thawing is crucial, and it takes at least 2 h before being ready to be used. Use chilled tips to pipette Geltrex.\nTransfer cells in desired volume in multi-well ultra-low attachment (ULA) culture plates.",
    "1.5 mL of cell suspension may be transferred in one well of a 6 well ULA plate.\nSeeded plates are transferred in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C. Spheroids are formed in 7–10 days of cell plating.\nEvery alternate day of cell seeding add 200 μL of 5× growth factor supplements per mL of culture media as supplement.\nAlternatives: Corning Matrigel (Merck, Cat. No. CLS356234) may also be used as an alternative to Geltrex.\nPassaging of primary spheroids and generation of secondary spheroid\nTiming: 2 h\nThe following section will accomplish the passaging of 3D-spheroids forming cells and generating secondary spheroids.\nTake primary spheroids into a fresh tube and spin at 300 × g for 4 min.\nDiscard supernatant and wash twice with PBS by centrifugation to remove Geltrex.\nAdd 300 μL 0.05% Trypsin-EDTA solution to spheroids and keep in the water bath maintained at 37°C for 10–15 min with intermittent vortexing.\nCheck under the microscope for complete dissociation to single cell suspension.\nAdd trypsin neutralizer solution and spin at 500 × g for 4 min.\nResuspend cell pellet in spheroid growth culture medium with 1× growth factor supplements.\nRepeat the steps of primary spheroid formation (step 73–77) for the secondary spheroid formation."
