    "See Figure 1 for an overview.\nTumor material\n1. Obtaining and Preparing Tumor Samples\nFor the use of patient material, approval of the Ethical Committee is necessary, and informed consent has to be obtained from the patient.\nHarvest representative material (minimum 1 cm3) at the time of intervention, either a biopsy or a resection of a sarcoma. The proper site of biopsy is defined using dynamic-contrast MRI.\nPlace the material immediately in a sterile vial containing DMEM supplemented with 1,000 U Penicillin and 1 mg/ml streptomycin.\nTransport the vial immediately (30 - 90 min) to the lab.\nAll following procedures are performed under laminar flow.\nPour the contents of the vial into a sterile Petri dish.\nPut the tumor sample into small parts of maximally 1 mm3 using a sterile scalpel. Remove all calcified parts as they tend to impair further processing of the tissue.\nRandomly take 10 tumor grafts for application on the CAM.\n2. Preparation of Tumor-derived Single Cell Suspensions\nApproximate duration: 3 hr.\nWeigh the remaining tissue of the sample.\nPut 2 - 4 g of tissue in a dissociator tube, more than one tube may be required to digest all the remaining tumor tissue.\nFor digestion of 2 - 4 g of tissue, add 2.5 ml collagenase 2 solution (500 U/ml RPMI 1640) and 2.5 ml DNase solution (22 KU/ml RPMI 1640).\nProcess the tissue according to the dissociator h_tumor protocol. This involves 2 cycles of incubation at 37 °C in CO2 incubator while the tube is shaken gently for 30 min.\nFilter the remaining suspension through a 150 μm cell strainer.\nCentrifuge the lysate at 1,000 rpm for 5 min.\nRemove the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 10 ml of erythrocyte lysis buffer (ELB), allowing 10 min of incubation with regular suspension.",
    "Note: erythrocyte lysis buffer is manufactured as follows: Add 0.037 g EDTA, 0.99 g K2HPO4, 8.29 g NH4Cl to 1,000 ml aqua, use 10 N NaOH to adjust the pH to 7.3, filter under pressure through a 0.22 μm filter. Store at 4 °C.\nAdd 25 ml of culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) to stop the reaction.\nCentrifuge the suspension at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. The color of the pellet should be white now.\nRemove the supernatant.\nAdd 5 ml of medium to the pellet. Filter the suspension through a 70 μm cell strainer.\nCount the number of live cells/ml by means of an automatic cell counter.\n3. Cancer Cell Lines\nSAOS2 osteosarcoma cells (ATCC number: HTB-85) expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein were electroporated by peGFP-C1 vector using the Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V according to the manufacturer's protocol. To establish stable cell lines, transfected cells were selected in G418 (1 mg/ml) for 4 weeks in line with previous established protocol20. In addition sorting was performed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) according to the manufacturer's instructions.\nCells from the SW1353 chondrosarcoma cell line (ATCC number: HTB-94) or freshly prepared tumor single cell suspensions are labeled using a red fluorescent lipophilic membrane stain.\nRemove the cells from the culture flask in a classical way using Trypsin (0.5% wt/vol) ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; 0.2% wt/vol) solution.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 1,000 rpm.\nRemove the supernatant.\nAdd 1 ml of serum-free medium and 5 μl DiI (Vybrant Red)/106 cells.\nWrap the vial in aluminum foil and put it in the CO2 incubator for 10 min at 37 °C.\nCentrifuge again for 5 min at 1,000 rpm and remove the supernatant.\nChorioallantoic membrane assay\n1. Egg Incubation",
    "Fertilized eggs from a local commercial hatchery guaranteeing 95% fertilisation of the eggs are required.\nFertilized eggs can be stored at RT up to 10 days.\nNote: before starting incubation, dirt, feathers and excrement are carefully removed from the eggshells mechanically by dry wiping with paper towels, which have a rough rather than a soft surface structure. Wiping the eggs with 70% denatured ethanol or any other cleaning reagent significantly reduces the survival rate of the chick embryos.\nPut the eggs in the incubator on one side, marking the upper surface. The day on which the eggs are put in the incubator is designated day 0 of embryonic development.\nSet the incubation temperature at 37.8 °C, and the humidity at 47%. Make sure the automatic rotation option is switched off.\n2. Opening of the Eggs\nDuration: ± 60 min for 25 eggs.\nOn development day 3, the eggs are opened under laminar airflow. Opening the eggs at a further developmental stage results in damage to the CAM, as the membrane tends to stick to the shell. An infrared lamp is used to keep the eggs warm during the procedure. To improve sterility, we recommend the use of hand gloves.\nPlace the egg in the eggcup, with the marked side facing upwards.",
    "Lower the level of the CAM by removing two ml of albumen through an 18 G needle inserted at the tip of the egg. If the needle is blunt after perforating several eggshells, replace the needle. If not, too much force has to be exerted, resulting in damage to the egg yolk or fracture of the shell. Sometimes the needle is blocked by the chalazae, one of 2 spiral bands suspending the yolk in albumen. This can be solved by gently pushing the plunger back down until the block is resolved. If egg yolk is sucked into the syringe, replace the needle as well as the syringe. Sometimes the embryo dies after this event. If an insufficient amount of albumen is removed, the CAM will be damaged when the shell is removed.\nApply a semipermeable adhesive film at the marked upper side of the shell in order to prevent spilling of shell particles onto the CAM while cutting the window.\nMake an introduction hole with a small awl at the surface of the egg.\nCut a window of 1 cm2 in the shell, using a pair of sterile sharp-pointed surgical scissors.\nThe embryo's pulsating heart and adjoining vessels can be observed at the surface of the egg yolk. Remove the non-fertilized eggs or dead embryos. An interrupted aspect of the blood vessels characterizes dead embryos.\nSeal the window with a semipermeable adhesive film. It is not necessary to cover the puncture site, unless the shell has cracked during insertion of the needle.\n3. Inoculation Procedure\nDuration: ± 1 hr per cell line.\nOn chick embryonic development day 9, the eggs are inoculated under laminar airflow.",
    "Evaluation of cancer cell spreading across the CAM requires containment of the cells to a limited surface during inoculation. Matrigel is an extracellular matrix (ECM) gel from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma frequently used in experimental cell culture conditions. It is a fluid when cooled, but will undergo thermally activated polymerization when brought to 20 - 40 °C, thus forming a stable gel. During the experiments, Matrigel is kept in a box containing melting ice.\nNote: We insist not to use perforated coverslips. We observed attachment and growth of grafted cancer cells onto the plastic disc thus biasing growth potential of the cells on the membrane itself.\nResuspend a cell pellet in cooled ECM gel at a concentration of 106 cells/100 μl ECM gel. Keep this solution on melting ice.\nExcise part of the semi-permeable membrane with a pair of sterile surgical under laminar airflow. If the adhesive film is removed completely, this will result in a larger proportion of embryonic death due to contamination.\nTouch the CAM right below the shell window lightly with a sterile glass rod, in order to remove the epithelial cell layer. Touching the CAM with a sterile glass rod proves to be less traumatic than using a scalpel n° 11, which requires more handiness and experience. Small hemorrhages may occur.\nAdding tumor material.\nFor tumor grafts: gently lower one piece of tissue onto the CAM with a pair of sterile forceps, without squeezing it.\nFor the ECM gel procedure: Add 4x 25 μl of the cell-ECM gel suspension to the CAM, on top of each other, allowing the ECM gel to polymerize in between the applications. In this way an adherent plaque containing the cancer cells is created.\nSeal the shell window again with a semipermeable adhesive film.\n4. Imaging and Harvesting of the CAM",
    "Duration: 2 hr for 25 eggs.\nOn chick embryonic development day 16, the CAMs are harvested. Working under laminar airflow is not necessary.\nEnlarge the window with a pair of surgical scissors. Make sure not to cut too low, otherwise the CAM will be damaged, resulting in bleeding of the injured vessels.\nAdd 300 - 500 μl of PBSD with a pipette onto the CAM section containing the inoculated material. If no fluorescent probes are used, buffered formaldehyde may be used as this makes the membrane stiffer, facilitating the cutting of the membrane.\nMake a photograph of the CAM in the egg through a stereo fluorescence microscope, equipped with a digital color camera, using both the GFP or the DSR filter, and no filter. For the tumor grafts, all photographs are made without filters. Illumination from above by LED lights is strongly recommended during photographing (Figure 2).\nRecord tumor cell migration for the labeled cells. The borders of the tumors may be irregular and frayed. Scattered cells may be present near the tumor borders. In some specimens, rows of tumor cells may be observed (Figure 3).\nCut the membrane with a pair of sterile scissors at the border lying against the shell.\nPlace the harvested CAM in a sterile Petri dish filled with PBSD or buffered formaldehyde.\nMake a photograph of both the upper side and the lower side of the CAM, both with and without filter.\nPut the membrane in a labeled container with buffered formaldehyde for at least 72 hr.",
    "Embed the CAMs in paraffin and prepare them for histological examination. Take care to cut the tumor grafts at the center of the nodule, making sure the cut surface is parallel to the bottom of the cassette. If not, the interaction between the CAM and the tumor graft will not be visible. The same strategy applies to the ECM gel plaques: the surface facing the cutting blade should be perpendicular to the plaque.\n5. Histological Evaluation\nHematoxylin-Eosin staining and Ki-67 immunohistochemistry were performed for further clarification, if needed. Immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 3.5 μm in thickness, using an automated slide stainer according to manufacturer's instructions. A mouse primary monoclonal antibody to Ki-67 (clone MIB-1, dilution 1/100) was used. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed using Cell Conditioning 1, and visualization was achieved with the Universal DAB Detection Kit, according to manufacturer's instructions. Dehydratation of the tissue sections was carried out using an automated coverslipper.\nFor the SAOS2 and the SW1353 cell lines, the number of Ki67-positive and Ki67-negative cell nuclei/100 μm2 were counted in three zones: one close to the border of the CAM, one close the surface and one in the center of the ECM gel plaque. This procedure was repeated 6x for each Ki-67 stained slide. The index of proliferation was determined for each slide by dividing the number of Ki67-positive cells by the total number of cells counted.\nNecrosis is defined by a loss of fine dispersion of chromatin in the cell nucleus, accompanied by fading of distinct cell margins. For xenografts, necrosis is scored as complete, partial (often at the surface), or absent. Infiltration of tumor cells into the CAM is defined by the observation of tumor cells within the mesoderm of the CAM, and is scored as being present or absent.",
    "Three items are scored for host behavior. Fibroblast infiltration is defined as elongated cells leaving the CAM and invading the tumor graft/plaque, and is scored as being present or absent. Vascular ingrowth can be observed as ingrowth of proliferating chick vessels, characterized by the presence of nucleated chick erythrocytes.Subscription Required.
