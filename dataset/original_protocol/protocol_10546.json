    "The detailed procedure for operating with the volumetric hand-held optoacoustic probe is described below. This procedure is performed according to approved institutional regulations regarding animal and human experiments.\n1. System Preparation\nSwitch on the laser for a warm-up period of ~15 min prior to operation for stabilizing the output light beam.\nPlace the water enclosing part with the isolating membrane that is in contact with the skin (Figure 1).\n\tNOTE: The distance between the isolating membrane (in contact with the skin) and the region with maximum sensitivity of the transducer (center of the spherical probe) establishes the effective imaging depth.\nFill the whole volume of approximately 100 ml between the isolating membrane and the surface of the transducer with deionized water by means of a pump.\nEnsure that no water leakage nor air bubbles are present. Alternatively, avoid air bubbles by providing recirculation of water.\nPerform the experiments at RT and ensure the coupling medium (water) is maintained at this temperature.\n2. Imaging Preparation\nHuman imaging preparation.\nRemove hair from the to-be-imaged part with a depilation lotion in order to avoid an undesired background in the images (this step is optional).\nApply ultrasound gel onto the skin around the region to be imaged in order to provide efficient acoustic coupling. Place the optoacoustic probe in the region of interest. Ensure that no air bubbles are present in the ultrasound coupling gel.\nAnimal imaging preparation.\nEnsure that the care and experimental procedures with animals are in agreement with institutional and government rules and regulations.\nRemove the fur of the animal in the region to be imaged with a shaving lotion. Protect the eyes of the animal with vet ointment, which prevents dryness and damage from exposure to intense pulsed laser radiation.",
    "Anesthetize the animal by using intraperitoneal injection (IP) of ketamine/xylazine (100 mg/kg KG Ketamine + 5 mg/kg KG Xylazine) prior to the experiment or use isoflurane anesthesia (2-3 % (by volume) with 0.9 l/min gas flow) during the experiment. Confirm anesthetization by checking the reflex of the hind limb of the animal.\nApply ultrasound gel onto the skin around the region to be imaged in order to provide efficient acoustic coupling and place the optoacoustic probe in the region of interest. Ensure that no air bubbles are present in the ultrasound coupling gel.\n3. Pre-view Operation Mode\nEstablish the imaging wavelength(s) between 690 nm and 900 nm and the pulse repetition rate between 10 and 50 Hz. Select the parameters for the acoustic data acquisition system – 1 MΩ input impedance. Acquire 2030 samples for each laser pulse at a sampling rate of 40 megasamples per second and 12 bit vertical resolution. Trigger the acquisition with Q-switch output of the laser.\nEnsure that both the operator and the patient use protective goggles adapted to the optical excitation wavelength(s). Set the laser power so that the light fluence at the tissue surface is maintained below 20 mJ/cm2 during the experiment for near-infrared wavelengths in order to satisfy safety exposure limits for human experiments19 and to prevent thermal strain and skin damage in animals.\nStart the pre-view software with a GPU implementation of processing algorithms to allow visualizing three-dimensional images at a frame rate corresponding to the pulse repetition rate of the laser.\nMove the probe and/or the object to be imaged in order to optimize visualization performance and localize the structures of interest.\n4. Data Acquisition\nData acquisition for scanning (hand-held) mode.\nIf necessary, inject a contrast agent prior to acquisition to enrich the contrast in the region of interest.",
    "NOTE: In our experiments we have not performed contrast-enhanced human imaging. Yet, various contrast agents can be potentially used for this purpose. Indocyanine Green (ICG) is one example of clinically-approved optical contrast agent that can be used for contrast enhancement at maximal recommended dose of 2 mg/kg of body weight in adults.\nStart the hardware for data acquisition with the parameters described in 3.1 maintaining the execution of the preview software. Gently move the probe around the imaged region to track the structures of interest.\n\tNOTE: When images at multiple laser wavelengths are acquired simultaneously, the speed of probe motion in the hand-held mode has to be decreased significantly (preferably below 2 mm/sec for a laser pulse repetition rate of 50 Hz) in order to avoid motion-related artifacts in the spectrally unmixed images.\nData acquisition for stationary mode.\nMount the imaged object (e.g., animal) and the hand-held probe onto the holder and start the acquisition with the parameters described in 3.1 maintaining the execution of the pre-view software.\nMaintain the optoacoustic probe and the imaging part in the same position during the experiment to visualize dynamic biological events in the region of interest.\nInject a contrast agent to track its dynamic distribution in the region of interest.\n\tNOTE: In our mouse experiments, Indocyanine Green (ICG) was used for contrast enhancement. As a general guideline, an amount of 10 nmol or 0.4 mg/kg of ICG has to be introduced into the mouse circulation in order to create detectable contrast with multi-spectral optoacoustics in vivo.\n\tNOTE: The contrast agent must be approved for human and/or animal use by the respective authority.\n5. Finalizing the Experiment\nStop the laser.\nRemove the optoacoustic probe from the imaged region. For animal study, stop the anesthesia supply.",
    "Position the animal under an infrared heater to keep it warm and prevent the contact with other animals until it fully recovered from the anesthesia. Do not leave the animal unattended during recovery from the anesthesia.\n6. Off-line Data Processing\nLoad the file(s) containing the acquired optoacoustic signals in the software application used for data processing.\nUse a reconstruction algorithm to obtain a three-dimensional matrix array corresponding to a volumetric image of the optical absorption for each frame and each wavelength.\n\tNOTE: For the reconstruction it is preferable to use an algorithm accounting for distorting factors, such as heterogeneities and attenuation in the imaged object, effects of final bandwidth and geometrical shape of the detection elements and light fluence variations, in order to obtain a more quantitative representation of the distribution of the absorbed energy.\nUse an unmixing algorithm to obtain, from each multi-wavelength frame, a new set of three-dimensional matrix arrays representing the optical absorption for each absorbing substance present in the sample.\nIf needed, further process the matrix arrays representing the optical absorption distribution to facilitate visualization and reading of biologically relevant parameters.\nSubscription Required.
