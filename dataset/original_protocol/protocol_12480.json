    "Both of the following protocols are most accurate when animals are housed on solid bottom caging with bedding material.\n1. Nest Scoring6\nWeigh out 8-10 g of nesting material.\n\t\nCrinkled paper nesting material (such as Enviro-Dri) is recommended as the substrate for nest scoring since most mice build better nests with this substrate6 but other materials can be used9.\nIdentify the cage(s) to be scored.\n\t\nAnimals should be housed in solid-bottomed cages for optimal performance on this test.\nPlace paper nesting material into the cage.\n\t\nNesting material can be provided at any time convenient to the researcher or animal care staff\nReturn the next day at 7-9 hr after lights on for scoring.\n\tNote: This is the best time to score nests since mice should be inactive10, nests score highest11, and animal rooms are quiet. If animals are active they may trample the nest, altering the score. Variation in nest building will occur depending on the amount of time the mice are given to build, making it important to score the same day and time after new material is provided.\nUse the nest scoring protocol by Hess et al.6 to score each nest (Figure 1).\n\t\nFirst determine whether the material has been manipulated by the mice. This includes being processed or moved around the cage.\n\t\t\nIf the material is untouched the whole nest receives a score of 0;\nNext determine if the majority of the nesting material has been gathered to a central nest site.\n\t\t\nNo nest site: If it is not clear where the nest site is located the cage receives a score of 1 (i.e. the material is spread throughout the cage);",
    "Nest site: If a centralized nest site is present, consider the nest as if it were a square. Each of the 4 sides of the square can be given a separate score from 2-5. The 4 scores are then averaged for the cage nest score.\n\t\t\t\n2 = the nest is flat with no shallow walls;\n3 = a slightly cupped shape where the wall of the nest is less than ½ the height of a dome that would cover a mouse;\n4 = a wall that is ½ the height of a dome;\n5 = walls that are taller than ½ the height of a dome, which may or may not fully enclose the nest.\nNote: Alternatively, scoring can occur 3-4 days after the provision of new material, when peak scores are often reached (unpublished data).\n2. Time to Integrate into Nest Test12\nNote: This test will be most accurate if the animal has a long fiber paper nesting material and has built a nest with a score of at least 2 (see above).\nTake a 2 in square of cotton nesting material (such as a Nestlet) and cut it into quarters, resulting in 4-1 in testing squares.\nTest animals within the first 3 hr of vivarium lights turning on.\n\t\nThis window of testing takes advantage of increased nest building behaviors prior to daytime inactivity11.\nOpen the cage lid and place 1 testing square on the opposite side of the cage from the main nest site.\n\t\nPlace the test square where it can be seen from outside the cage.\nThe test material should be placed in the same location each time the test is conducted.\nReturn to the cage after 10 min.",
    "Note: If the test square is missing from its original location, the cage is TINT positive. If the test square remains in the original location, the cage is TINT negative and additional observations may be needed to determine if the mice require veterinary attention."
