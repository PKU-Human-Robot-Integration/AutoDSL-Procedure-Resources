    "1. Seeding of Endothelial Cells\nObtain primary cultures of RBMEC’s from adult Sprague Dawley rats (or obtain them commercially).\nCultivate RBMECs in 100 cm fibronectin (50 µg/ml) coated petri dishes using the rat brain endothelial cell growth medium. Change the medium every two days, until confluency is reached.\nOn reaching 80-90% confluency, gently wash the cells in 5 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS) by swirling. The cells are then detached by exposing them to 1 ml of warm 0.25% trypsin- ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) solution, equilibrated to 37 °C.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C for 2-5 min until the cells are detached and dispersed.\n\tNOTE: Tap the culture dish to detach the cells. View cells under the microscope to confirm complete detachment of cells from the surface of the dish.\nAdd 5 ml complete media to the petri dish in order to neutralize trypsin. Pipette out the medium containing detached cells and collect it into a 15 ml centrifuge tube. .\nCentrifuge the media containing endothelial cells at 220 x g for 5 min.\nAspirate the supernatant and preserve the pellet containing cells.Suspend the pellet into 3-5 ml fresh rat brain endothelial cell growth medium by gently mixing it up and down with pipette Cells will be then be counted using automated cell counter or a hemocytometer.\nTransfer the cell suspension into fibronectin (50 μg/ml) precoated 8 well sterile chamber slide system, 0.7 cm2/well with a seeding density ranging between 10,000-15,000 cells per well. Grow the cells at 37 °C until confluence is achieved\n\tNOTE: For performing western blots or other experiments,cells can be grown in 10 cm cell culture dishes or special dishes as required by the experiment.\n2. Oxygen and Glucose Deprivation-Reoxygenation In Vitro Model",
    "NOTE: The following protocol has been adapted from Zulueta et al. 1997; Zhu H et al. 20128,9.\nUse the hypoxia cell culture system to study the effects of of OGD-R on RBMECs in (see Figure 1). Setup and calibrate the hypoxia cell culture system before beginning the experiment, according to manufacturer’s instructions.\nRemove the confluent chamber slides (step 1.8) from the 37 °C incubator. Replace the complete medium in the chamber slide with deoxygenated, no glucose, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) and placed in hypoxia chamber with 95%, N2 and 5% CO2 for 2 h at 37 °C, to represent OGD condition.\nMove the cells back to the incubator with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C and provided with fresh rat brain endothelial cell complete medium and incubate for another 1 hr at 37 °C.\n\tNOTE: This step represents a reoxygenation situation.\nUse the chamber slides for immunofluorescence localization and rhodamine phalloidin labeling (see section 3).\n3. Immunofluorescence Localization of ZO-1 and f-actin Labeling Using Rhodamine Phalloidin\nExpose the chamber slides containing RBMEC monolayers to 100 μl of opti-MEM/reduced serum media/well for 1 hr. Wash the chamber slides 3 times in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.0-7.2).\nFix the cells using 100 μl of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.0-7.2) for 15 min and wash the chamber slides for 3 more times in PBS (pH 7.0-7.2).\nPermeabilize the cells using 100 μl of 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS, (pH 7.0-7.2) for another 15 min. Block with 100 μl of 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for an hour. After this step either stain/label cells either for ZO-1 or f-actin.",
    "For immunofluorescence staining incubate the cells with an anti-rabbit primary antibody against ZO-1 in 1:150, prepared in 2% BSA-PBS for O/N at 4 °C. Wash the cells 3 times in PBS,(pH 7.0-7.2). Incubate with 100 μl of Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-tagged anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 hr at RT.\nFor Rhodamine Phalloidin labeling, following blocking, expose the cells to 100 μl of rhodamine phalloidin in 1:50 dilution, prepared in 2% BSA-PBS, for 20 min.\nWash the cells from immunofluorescence staining and rhodamine phalloidin labeling in PBS, (pH 7.0-7.2). Mount the chambers using mounting media containing anti-fade reagent with DAPI.\nVisualize the cells using a 60 X water immersion lens and cells are scanned in a single optical plane under a confocal microscope.\nSubscription Required.
