    "RNA LabelingOrder your modified RNA oligonucleotide. For this protocol, the following sequence is used:5′-GCG GGG ACG ACC CXG C-3′, with X = 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridineThe labeling position should not disturb the overall RNA structure or its function; thus, avoid labeling at catalytically active sites or binding pockets. To minimize possible perturbations, design the modified oligonucleotide strands by exchanging a naturally occurring uridine nucleotide with the modified 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine. Moreover, where possible, it is preferable to integrate the modification into a double-stranded RNA region since this promotes narrow distance distributions.Note: Establish an RNase-free environment: Clean your bench and tools e.g., pipettes with 70% ethanol or RNase Away. Wear protective gloves throughout this workflow. Aliquot the RNADissolve the RNA oligonucleotide in DEPC-treated water (see Recipes).Aliquot 2.5 nmol RNA into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes (Note 1).Dry the RNA oligonucleotide aliquots in a SpeedVac vacuum concentrator or a freeze dryer. Store the dried RNA oligonucleotide aliquots at -20°C.Set up the RNA labeling reactionPre-heat the Thermomixer to 60°C.Dissolve the dried RNA oligonucleotide in 4.4 µl DEPC-treated water (see Recipes).Weigh 1-2 mg CuI (X) into a 2-ml Eppendorf tube and calculate the volume of DMSO (Y), to obtain a 50 mM Cu+ solution:                                               imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210427/20210427231157_7147.pngRead Note 2 before you continue! Dissolve CuI in Y µl DMSO and immediately prepare the Cu+-complex by mixing together:20 µl DMSO8 µl 50 mM Cu+ solution from the previous step3.6 µl 250 mM THPTA/DMSO solutionVortex the mixture and incubate for 5 min at room temperatureSet up the labeling reaction by pipetting the following solutions into the 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube containing the dissolved RNA (Step A3b):2 µl spin label/DMSO solution, taken from the 100 mM stock solution4.",
    "6 µl THPTA-Cu+ solution (Step A3d)Shortly vortex the reaction mixture and incubate the reaction at 300 rpm and 60°C for 30 min (Note 3)Desalt the RNA oligonucleotide and remove Cu+ via an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter deviceAdd 480 µl DEPC-treated water to each reaction tube and transfer each solution to an Amicon Ultra-0.5 filter, previously inserted into an Amicon collection tube.Spin and concentrate for 30 min at 14,000 × g and room temperature.Add 500 µl DEPC-treated water to the Amicon filter device and spin again for 30 min at room temperature and 14,000 × g, discard the flowthrough.Repeat Step A4c one more time.For RNA recovery, turn the Amicon filter device around and insert it into a clean Amicon collection tube. Spin for 2 min at room temperature and 14,000 × g.Pipette 50 µl Milli-Q water into the Amicon filter device and wash the membrane by pipetting up and down or by vortexing. Then, place the filter device again upside down and spin for 2 min at room temperature and 14,000 × g.Wash the filter membrane again, as described in Step A4f, two more times. The sample volume should now be around 200 µl.Determine the amount of RNA oligonucleotide (nRNA) using the NanoDrop: Clean the NanoDrop measurement pedestal with 70% ethanol using a light-duty tissue wiper. Using a pipette, transfer 1 µl DEPC-treated water onto the measurement pedestal and run a blank measurement as a reference. Clean the pedestal with a light-duty tissue wiper, pipette 1 µl RNA solution onto the measurement pedestal and measure the absorbance at 260 nm (Abs260nm). Then, calculate nRNA with the extinction coefficient (εRNA), either provided by the vendor or calculated using an online tool such as the IDT OligoAnalizer Tool and the volume of your RNA oligonucleotide sample (VRNA) using:                                               imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210427/20210427231551_0488.",
    "png Evaporate the excess water from your RNA oligonucleotide sample, either with the SpeedVac vacuum concentrator or the freeze dryer, until you obtain a volume that does not exceed half of your HPLC-loop capacity. If using a 100 µl injection loop, e.g., inject a volume of 30-50 µl.Reversed-phase HPLC purificationStart with the equilibration of your reversed-phase column. Therefore, re-buffer the column to 8% buffer A (acetonitrile) and 92% buffer B (0.1 M triethylammonium acetate).Perform a blank run to check the purity of your column before you purify your sample: Load 30-50 µl Milli-Q water with a Hamilton syringe into the injection loop and start the HPLC run. The blank run uses the same operation parameters as the purification run of your RNA sample. In general, you will need to fine-tune the HPLC run for each new RNA sequence. However, you can use the following settings as a starting point for RNA sequences shorter than 50 nucleotides: Elute with a gradient of 8% → 25% buffer A for 20 min with a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Then, equilibrate your column back to 8% buffer A. For short RNA sequences, use the analytical Zorbax 300SB-C18, 4.6 × 150 mm column, but for sequences exceeding 50 nucleotides, use the preparative Zorbax 300SB-C18, 9.4 x 250 mm column. The elution profile for the preparative column is: Elute with 8% acetonitrile for 10 min and then apply a gradient of 8% → 23% buffer A for 55 min with a constant flow rate of 2 ml/min. Finally, equilibrate your column back to 8% buffer A. It is important to heat your HPLC column to avoid the formation of tertiary RNA structures (Figure 2). Heat the column to 60°C, also during the blank run, to ensure the same conditions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4004/bioprotoc-11-09-4004-g002.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Exemplary normalized HPLC chromatograms of unlabeled RNA at different column temperatures. Upon column heating, the formation of tertiary structures is inhibited, which leads to a single peak (black chromatogram).Inject your RNA sample into the loop. Do not inject more than 2.5 nmol RNA to avoid column overloading. However, you should check the capacity and properties in the manufacturer’s instructions of the particular column you use.Run the HPLC method.Separately collect the fractions of unlabeled and labeled RNA. The collection can be performed manually or, if your HPLC is equipped with a fraction collector, automatically. If you use a fraction collector, you can set a constraint to collect everything that exceeds an absorbance of e.g., 15 mAU.Pool each HPLC peak separately and concentrate the solutions in the SpeedVac vacuum concentrator until you obtain a volume of about 500 µl for each peak.After the HPLC run has finished, proceed with the purification of your next sample or store the HPLC column. The storage of your column is achieved by rebuffering it to 80% buffer A.Desalt the labeled RNA with an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter deviceDesalt the RNA samples using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter device, as already described above in Steps A4a-A4h.After desalting your RNA samples, concentrate them in the SpeedVac vacuum concentrator until you reach the desired concentration. Yields of 50-70% with respect to the starting amount of RNA are usually obtained; the losses largely originate from the purification steps. The labeling itself is quantitative, as shown in the HPLC chromatograms (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4004/bioprotoc-11-09-4004-g003.jpgFigure 3. Normalized chromatograms of different HPLC runs. A. Chromatogram obtained by injection of water (blank run). B. Chromatogram obtained by injection of unlabeled RNA. C. Chromatogram obtained by injection of RNA from a labeling reaction.",
    "From the chromatogram of the labeled RNA (C), it can be inferred that there is almost no unlabeled RNA left in the reaction mixture, as only a negligible peak at a retention time of ~2 min is obtained. For further purification, only the peak at a retention time of 10 min has been collected and used.Determine the purity of your labeled RNA sequence via LC-MS (or HPLC and mass spectrometry separately)Perform an LC-MS measurement of the unlabeled RNA, as a reference. The procedure is analogous to that of an HPLC run (equilibration of the column with buffer C, injection, run, and storage). Use a gradient of 5% → 20% buffer D for 20 min with a constant flow rate of 0.4 ml/min.Perform an LC-MS measurement of the labeled RNA sample; use the gradient specified in Step A7a. Successful labeling can be checked by determining the exact mass of the species present in a specific LC peak.If you do not have access to an LC-MS system, perform an analytical HPLC run and subject the fractions containing RNA to ESI-MS or MALDI-MS to determine the exact mass.Determine the spin labeling efficiencyDetermine the concentration of labeled RNA(cRNA)  using the NanoDrop (Step A4h).Prepare 10 µl 25 µM RNA solution, if each RNA strand is singly labeled. If the RNA strand is doubly labeled, halve the RNA concentration.Fill the solution into a 10 µl capillary.Perform a cw EPR measurement as described in the user’s manual of the EMXnano spectrometer. Use the “spin count” routine from Bruker to determine the spin concentration(cspin).  Another way to determine the spin concentration is to doubly integrate the cw EPR spectrum and to relate this double integral value to that of a reference sample of known spin concentration. The error margin of both spin quantitation methods is 10-20%.",
    "Calculate the labeling efficiency. For singly labeled RNA sequences, the efficiency is given by:                                          imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210427/20210427232633_5312.png For doubly labeled sequences, use:                                          imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210427/20210427232905_5753.png Keep in mind that although LC-MS reveals almost quantitative labeling, the yield of labeled RNA with respect to the starting RNA is 50-70% due to losses during purification.Prepare the PELDOR sampleFor singly labeled RNA, transfer 2.0 nmol into an Eppendorf tube and dry it in the SpeedVac vacuum concentrator or freeze-dryer. Halve the amount for doubly labeled RNA.Dissolve the RNA in 64 µl D2O. Add 16 µl EG-d6 as a cryoprotectant and mix the solution carefully in an Eppendorf tube. This yields a sample of 80 µl with a spin concentration of 25 µM containing 20% v/v EG-d6 (Note 4). During PELDOR measurements, the resonator should be completely filled with your sample; thus, even if your RNA amount is scarce, avoid preparing samples with a volume less than 60 µl.Fill the entire 80 µl into a 3 mm outer diameter Q-band EPR tube with the Eppendorf pipette using the elongated pipette tips. Carefully shake the EPR tube such that the sample collects at the bottom.Freeze the sample by carefully immersing the EPR tube into a Dewar vessel with liquid nitrogen. As EPR tubes may crack during freezing, wear safety goggles and use cold-protection gloves when handling liquid nitrogen. Keep the tube in the Dewar vessel with liquid nitrogen.PELDOR MeasurementsPrepare the ELEXSYS E580 Q-Band EPR spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin) for the PELDOR measurement:As EPR spectrometers are sensitive devices that can be damaged upon operator errors, stick to this protocol and the instructions in the user manual of the instrument. In case of doubt, seek advice from a more experienced colleague.",
    "Connect the turbomolecular pump to the cryostat, switch on the pump, and evacuate the cryostat to a reduced pressure of ~10-4 mbar. Evacuating overnight may be helpful to reach the required vacuum conditions.Switch on the heat exchanger of the spectrometer and check the temperature of the inward and return flow. Depending on the ambient temperature, the former should be around 10-15°C and the latter should not surpass 25-30°C. If the spectrometer has a closed cooling circuit, check the water level in this system and refill if necessary.Switch on the spectrometer console, the magnet power supply, and the TWT amplifier. It is important to keep the TWT in the Standby mode to prevent damage of the detection system. Give the system ~1 h to warm-up before starting measurements as this ensures electronic stability of the spectrometer.Connect the overflow valve of the helium tank to the helium recovery system, if available in your facility. Make sure that the gasflow through the tubing is not blocked (e.g., due to bending) and open the overflow valve on the helium tank to prevent pressure build-up.From this step on, wear cold protection gloves and safety goggles! Open the needle valve on the helium transfer line. Slowly (~3 min for the whole procedure) insert the transfer line into the helium tank. As the transfer line enters the liquid helium, the gas meter will indicate a gasflow and occasionally, a hiss-sound can be perceived. If helium gas exits the tank directly from the upper opening, first screw the nut encircling the transfer line hand-tight and then fix it with a spanner as soon as the transfer line is fully inserted into the tank.Immerse the lance of the transfer line into ethanol and check for gasflow.",
    "Wipe the gas outlet with a tissue and connect the lance to the cryostat of the spectrometer.Close the cryostat with an empty sample rod to prevent condensation of air within the cryostat.Connect the membrane pump to the port on the transfer line. Open the needle valve on the transfer line approximately ¼ turn and switch on the membrane pump to maintain a stream of cold helium gas. Using the gasflow controller of the cryostat, adjust the helium gasflow to ~1 L/h. Switch on the iTC503S temperature controller and set the target temperature to 50K. Cooling down the cryostat from ambient temperatures to 50K usually takes 20-30 min (Note 5).Take the EPR tube out of the liquid nitrogen Dewar vessel and quickly wipe it with a tissue to remove potential contaminants and ice. However, make sure not to keep the EPR tube outside the liquid nitrogen for too long to prevent the sample from warming up. If liquid nitrogen has condensed within the tube, warming up the tube might lead to ejection of the sample or even rupture of the tube.Insert the EPR tube into a tightly fitting sample holder and adjust its position such that the sample will be located in the EPR-active zone of the resonator. For the ER5106-QT2 resonator, the center of the sample should be 38 mm below the lower end of the tube holder.Screw the sample holder, with the EPR tube inserted, into a sample rod.Ensure that the spectrometer is in the Standby mode. Stop the membrane pump, wait until the needle of the gasflow controller has dropped to zero, and remove the empty sample rod from the cryostat. Quickly, but also carefully and straight, insert the sample rod, with the EPR tube mounted, as far as it will go.",
    "Do not leave the cryostat open for a longer period to prevent air condensation (Note 6). Wait at least 20 min before you proceed to the next steps so that the sample is thermally equilibrated.Spectrometer tuning and safety checkFamiliarize yourself with the basic functions and operation windows of the Xepr-software by means of the spectrometer manual. In particular, look up keywords such as “Pulse Tables,” “PulseSPEL,” “SpecJet,” “FT EPR Parameters,” “FT Bridge,” “Microwave Bridge Tuning Dialog Box,” and “Acquisition Trigger.” If you need further explanations, ask a more experienced EPR colleague for advice. In the following steps, the buttons, input boxes, and menu bars in the Xepr-software that you should use at a particular step are set in quotation marks.Connect the Xepr-software to the spectrometer by selecting “Connect to Spectrometer” in the “Acquisition”-menu and open the “Microwave Bridge Tuning Dialog Box.” Go into the “Tune”-mode and set the “Attenuation” to 10 dB. Set the microwave (MW) frequency to ~33.7 GHz.Over-couple the resonator (Note 7). The ER5106-QT2 resonator has two screws to adjust the cavity length (right screw) and the cavity coupling (left screw). Adjust the cavity length such that the resonator tuning dip becomes visible in the MW Bridge Tuning Dialog Box. Note that there are two tuning dips for the ER5106-QT2 resonator, a “real” dip and a “fake” dip. These can be distinguished as the “fake” dip moves markedly when the coupling screw is rotated, whereas the “real” dip stays in place. Changing the cavity length moves both dips simultaneously.Adjust the cavity coupling and the cavity length such that the “real” dip is centered in the Tuning Dialog Box and that the minimum of the “fake” dip is on the right side of the window.",
    "Perform the safety check of the spectrometer’s detection system as described in the instrument manual. Attention: Do not attempt to switch the TWT into the Operate mode, if the defense pulses are absent, as this would damage the detection circuitry. In case of doubt, consult your spectrometer administrator.Optimize a standing Hahn echo (Weber, 2005)Adjust the “Center Field” B0 to the value corresponding to g ~2.00 at the current MW frequency ν (e.g., B0 ~11,980 G at ν ~33.7 GHz).In the Pulse Tables, program the Hahn echo sequence (π/2–τ–π–τ–Echo) into the “+x”channel using pulse lengths of 12 ns and 24 ns for π/2 and π-pulses, respectively. Use τ = 200 ns for the interpulse delay. After entering pulse lengths and delays into the Pulse Tables, confirm each entry by pressing “Enter” on the keyboard.Select the “Acquisition Trigger”-channel from the dropdown menu and set the acquisition trigger “Length” to 4 ns at the “Position” 0 ns. Set the “Integrator Time Base” to 1.0 ns, the “Shot Rep. Time” to 3,000 µs, and the number of “Shots Per Point” to 10.Click “Start” in the Patterns window, “Run” in SpecJet, and decrease the MW “Attenuation” to observe the Hahn echo in SpecJet. Adjust the “Attenuation” to maximize the Hahn echo amplitude i.e., to obtain π/2 and π-pulses at the given pulse lengths (Note 8).Set the “No. of Averages” in SpecJet to 1. Set the “Video Bandwidth” to 20 MHz and adjust the “Video Gain” amplification such that the echo is not clipped. Fine-adjust the MW phase such that the echo is fully detected in the real channel of the quadrature detector (green trace in SpecJet); the signal in the imaginary channel (yellow trace in SpecJet) should be zero on average.",
    "Slight changes in the “Center Field” may be helpful in this context to fully bring the sample on resonance.Record the echo-detected field-swept EPR spectrumAdjust the acquisition trigger “Position” in the Pulse Tables in such a way that the echo starts at the left of the SpecJet window and increase the acquisition trigger “Length” to ~120 ns, in order to cover the whole echo (Figure 4A). This maximizes the spectral resolution of the field-swept spectrum (Figure 4B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4004/bioprotoc-11-09-4004-g004.jpgFigure 4. Initial steps for setting up pulsed EPR experiments. A. Hahn echo. B. Echo-detected field-swept EPR spectrum. The grey area in (A) marks the integration region to obtain the field-swept spectrum.In the “Field”-tab within the FT EPR Parameters window, set the “Sweep Width” to 400 G.Switch to the “Acquisition”-tab to set the “X-Axis Size”, i.e., the number of points in the spectrum. Usually, 800 is an appropriate value, corresponding to a resolution of 0.5 G/point.Press the “Run” button in the main window to record the spectrum (Figure 4B). Depending on the spin concentration, average multiple scans to obtain a good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and save the data to disk.Read off the magnetic field value that yields the maximum signal intensity in the field-swept spectrum and write it down, you will need it later.Perform the Two-Pulse Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (Two-Pulse ESEEM) experiment to obtain information on transverse electron spin relaxation, which limits the dipolar evolution window in the PELDOR experiment. In the Two-Pulse ESEEM experiment, the Hahn echo amplitude is monitored as a function of the interpulse delay τ. The default PulseSPEL program provided by Bruker records it as a function of τ. Note, however, that some literature references show these Hahn echo decay curves as a function of 2τ.",
    "Set the “Center Field” to the magnetic field value of the signal maximum in the field-swept spectrum.In the “Acquisition”-tab, open “PulseSPEL” by clicking the corresponding button.Load the standard PulseSPEL program for the Two-Pulse ESEEM experiment, which is by default located in the folder:“xeprFiles/PulseSPEL/sharedPulseSPEL/Standard/Spel2009/ESEEM”, and the corresponding variable definitions “descrESEEM.def”.Set the variables to the values shown in Table 1.Table 1.

Read off the time value at which the echo amplitude is maximal and set this value as the acquisition trigger delay parameter d0. Usually, this value amounts to d0 = 432 ns.Select the “2P ESEEM” experiment with a two-step phase cycle, set the number of points for this experiment (parameter dim2 in the PulseSPEL program) to 1,024, and click the “Run” button in the main window to record the Hahn echo decay curve (Figure 5B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4004/bioprotoc-11-09-4004-g005.jpgFigure 5.

The inset shows the initial 1.5 µs of the trace, the maximum at 232 ns is highlighted by a red line.If the curve does not reach the zero level at long interpulse delays τ, increase the number of points and/or the time step d30. Read off the time value at which the echo intensity has dropped to almost zero and write it down.Setting up the PELDOR experimentPELDOR is a double-frequency experiment that uses the probe frequency νprobe to create a signal on a spin A in a molecule and flips a spin B in the same molecule with the pump frequency νpump. The four-pulse PELDOR sequence is shown in Figure 6. Firstly, a Hahn echo (HE) is created by a π/2 and a π-pulse applied at νprobe and affecting spin A. Next, a pump pulse πpump at the frequency νpump inverts spin B.",
    "Finally, a refocusing π-pulse at νprobe is applied, refocusing the Hahn echo from spin A. In the PELDOR experiment, the position of the pump pulse is incremented within the interval τ2 and the integrated intensity of the refocused echo (RE) is measured as a function of the delay T. This yields the so-called PELDOR time trace. If intramolecular dipolar coupling between spins A and B occurs, the coupling frequency will be encoded in the oscillations of the time trace. The overall exponential decay refers to the intermolecular dipolar interactions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4004/bioprotoc-11-09-4004-g006.jpgFigure 6. Schematic representation of the PELDOR sequence. Microwave pulses at the probe frequency are shown in black, the pump pulse is displayed in red. “HE” abbreviates the Hahn echo, “RE” the refocused echo. In the PELDOR experiment, the position of the pump pulse is incremented within the first interval τ2 and the integrated intensity of the RE is measured as a function of T.The set-up of the PELDOR experiment consists of various steps, and as PELDOR requires phase cycling and nuclear modulation averaging, it is commonly run from a PulseSPEL program. The Bruker EPR spectrometers are by default equipped with a PulseSPEL program for PELDOR; however, many research groups have developed their own programs featuring custom variable definitions and conventions. Herein, we describe how to set up the PELDOR experiment with our version of the PulseSPEL program, which is available in the Appendix[href=https://os.bio-protocol.org/attached/file/20210105/Appendix.docx].Set the variables for the Hahn echo and optimize it at the pump frequency, which is applied in the center of the resonator dip (33.7 GHz).Load the PELDOR program and the variable definition file into PulseSPEL.Set the following parameters in PulseSPEL (Table 2):Table 2.

However, setting completely improper parameters will result in a poor SNR, a low modulation depth, and data distortion.Click “Compile,” “Show Program,” and “Validate” in this order.Select the “2P ESE Setup” experiment. Press the “Run” button in the main window, click “Start” in SpecJet and in the Pulse Tables, and lower the “Attenuation” to 0 dB.Open the “MPFU control”-tab. Drag the “< +x > Amplitude” slider bar to a level of ~60-70% to maximize the Hahn echo amplitude in SpecJet.Adjust the global MW phase using the “Signal Phase” slider bar in the FT bridge window. The MW phase should be adjusted such that the signal appears in the real channel of SpecJet and the imaginary channel should be zero on average.Apply the pump pulse to invert the echo and determine the optimal pump pulse length.Click “Stop” in the Pulse Tables and in SpecJet.Select the “3P ELDOR Setup” experiment, set the “Current ELDOR Frequency” to the current spectrometer frequency (~33.7 GHz), and press the “Run”-button in the main window. Write down the “Current ELDOR Frequency” for later use.Read off the time at which the maximum of the echo occurs in the viewport (Figure 7A, e.g., 72 ns), add it to d0, and set the new value of d0 (e.g., 432 ns) in PulseSPEL. Press “Run” in the main window; the echo should now be maximal at the zero-time on the abscissa in the view port (Figure 7B).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4004/bioprotoc-11-09-4004-g007.jpgFigure 7.

B. d0 = 432 ns, the echo maximum coincides with the origin of the abscissa.Start SpecJet.",
    "Decrease the “ELDOR Attenuation” to 0 dB, which should invert the Hahn echo (Note 9a-d).Click “Stop” in SpecJet and in the Pulse Tables window. Select the “3P ELDOR Nutation” experiment and press “Run” in the main window; this experiment increments the pump pulse length and measures the amplitude of the Hahn echo. Read off the pump pulse length that leads to the global minimum of the nutation trace and set this value as the parameter p2. Typically, and depending on the sample, optimal pump pulse lengths between 12 ns and 18 ns are obtained (Note 9e).Set the “Attenuation” to 60 dB, the “ELDOR Attenuation” to 30 dB, and switch the TWT amplifier into the Standby mode. Set the MW Bridge into the “CW”-mode.Change the MW frequency and optimize the Hahn echo at the probe frequency.Open the “MW Bridge Tuning Dialog Box” and change the spectrometer frequency by the desired offset (e.g., -80 MHz with respect to the pump frequency) using the “Frequency Slider.”Perform the safety check as described in the instrument manual and switch the TWT into the Operate mode.Select the “2P ESE Setup” experiment, the phase cycle option “< + x > none”, and press “Run” in the main window.Click “Start” in the Pulse Tables window, “Run” in SpecJet, and decrease the “Attenuation” to 0 dB in steps of 10 dB.Drag the “< + x > Amplitude” slider bar in the MPFU control window to maximize the echo amplitude. Adjust the “< + x > Phase” such that the signal has a negative sign in the real channel. The imaginary channel should be zero on average.Select the “< - x > none” phase cycle option and again click “Run” in the main window. Adjust the “< - x > Amplitude” slider bar to maximize the Hahn echo.",
    "Drag the “< - x > Phase” slider such that the signal has a positive sign in the real channel. The imaginary part of the signal should be zero on average.Make sure that the absolute echo amplitudes obtained with the phase cycle options “< + x > none” and “< - x > none” are equal.Choose the length of the dipolar evolution window τ2.The length of the interval τ2, i.e., the length of the PELDOR time trace, is governed by two aspects, namely transverse electron spin relaxation and the inter-spin distance to be resolved. Transverse electron spin relaxation dictates the maximum of the dipolar evolution window, this can be read off the Hahn echo decay curve recorded in Step B5. The minimal length of τ2 is given by the need to resolve at least 1.5 dipolar oscillations encoding the most probable distance in the sample for reliable data analysis.If you have prior knowledge of the expected inter-spin distance (e.g., from in silico spin labeling), compute the expected oscillation period and set τ2 accordingly to resolve at least 1.5 oscillations in the time trace.If there is no information available on the expected distance, choose a value for τ2 according to the Hahn echo decay curve. Set τ2 to a value at which sufficient signal intensity is still left in the Two-Pulse ESEEM-trace. If you later realize that a longer dipolar evolution time window is needed to resolve 1.5 oscillations, abort the PELDOR run, increase τ2, and re-start the measurement. Note that artefacts may occur at the end of the time trace, which have to be cut off later (see section on Data analysis). Take this into account and hence increase τ2 sufficiently.Set the chosen value for τ2 in PulseSPEL and activate it by clicking “Compile,” “Show Program,” and “Validate.",
    "” Depending on the length of the time trace, consider increasing or decreasing the time increment d30. Find a trade-off between a sufficiently high resolution of the dipolar oscillations and acceptable measurement times (Note 10).Optimize the refocused Hahn echo.Set the “ELDOR Attenuation” to 0 dB.Select the “4P DEER Setup” program with the phase cycle option “2-step”. Click “Run” in the main window, “Start” in the Pulse Tables window, and “Run” in SpecJet.Set the “No. of Averages” in SpecJet to 1.Increase the “Video Gain” amplification such that the echo fills the whole display of SpecJet without clipping at the top or bottom edge.In SpecJet, set the “No. of Averages” to a higher value (100-1,000) such that the echo can be recognized clearly. Depending on the number of transient averages to accumulate, this may take a while.Press “Run” in the main window to transfer the echo from SpecJet into the viewport. Read off the time position at which the echo is maximal.Set the integration gate width (parameter pg in PulseSPEL) to the length of the longest pulse in the PELDOR sequence, most likely the π-pulse at the probe frequency.Adjust the acquisition trigger offset d0 such that the echo maximum is located at the center of the integration gate. Example: Assume that the refocused echo, recorded with d0 = 360 ns, peaks at 72 ns (Figure 8A). The integration gate length should be 24 ns starting at the zero-point of the time axis (grey rectangle in Figure 8B). Thus, in order to transfer the echo maximum to the position of 12 ns, set the acquisition delay d0 = 360 ns + (72 - 12) ns = 420 ns.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4004/bioprotoc-11-09-4004-g008.jpgFigure 8.

    "B. d0 = 420 ns, the echo peaks at 12 ns. The grey rectangle indicates the integration gate width of 24 ns for the PELDOR experiment.Click “Run” in the main window and check proper positioning of the echo.Run the PELDOR experiment.Calculate the number of points to be recorded on the PELDOR time trace and set it as the parameter dim5 in the PulseSPEL program. It is given by:                                        imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20210428/20210428011659_9590.png with the interpulse delays d1 and d2 of the PELDOR sequence (τ1 and τ2 in Figure 6), the dead-time delay of the spectrometer d3, and the time increment d30.Select the “4P DEER” experiment and the 2-step phase cycle from the dropdown menu and click “Run” in the main window. Click the “Re/Im”-button in the main window toolbar to display the imaginary channel and make sure that it is flat and around the zero level. Change the MW phase accordingly, if there is an appreciable amount of signal in the imaginary channel.Set a sufficiently high number of scans (50-1,500) to achieve a good SNR. The SNR can be defined as the modulation depth divided by the standard deviation of the noise and should amount to at least 20 or better 100 to permit reliable data analysis. Determination of the SNR can be achieved using e.g., the program SnrCalculator. Depending on the spin concentration, the length of the time trace, and the chosen frequency offset, acquisition times between 4 h and 48 h are usual (Note 10).As the measurement has finished, save the data on disk in the standard Bruker BES3T-format (.DTA / .DSC-files).A summary of all key steps described above is shown in Figure 9.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4004/bioprotoc-11-09-4004-g009.jpgFigure 9.

The integration gate has a length of 24 ns and is indicated by the grey shaded area. C. Raw PELDOR time trace as obtained from the spectrometer prior to data processing.Switch the TWT into the Standby mode. Set the “Attenuation” to 60 dB and the “ELDOR Attenuation” to 30 dB. Switch the microwave bridge into the “CW”-mode and then to “Standby”.If the RNA strand and the spin label are rigid, as is the case here and in Wuebben et al., 2020, orientation selection can occur, i.e., not all orientations of the inter-spin vector with respect to the external magnetic field are sampled in one pair of pump and probe frequency. Orientation selection manifests itself in the PELDOR time traces by the dipolar oscillations becoming dependent on the microwave frequency offset Δν. Moreover, the Fourier-transform of the time traces no longer displays the whole Pake pattern.  Regarding data acquisition, two approaches exist to cope with orientation selection. Firstly, the PELDOR experiment can be performed at the frequency offset with minimal orientation selection; in our hands, this is achieved by applying the pump pulse at the maximum of the nitroxide spectrum and the probe pulses at an offset of -80 MHz with respect to νpump.  Secondly, PELDOR measurements can be performed at different combinations of νpump and νprobe. This approach also offers the possibility to take the orientational selectivity explicitly into account during data analysis (see section on Data analysis; Wuebben et al., 2019).  If you opt for the latter approach, repeat this protocol from Step B6c, now using another offset between νpump and νprobe (Figure 10).",
    "It is recommended to perform orientation-selective measurements on a particular sample directly one after another and not to remove the sample in between. Thus, the tuning and the sample positioning within the resonator will be equal for all offsets and no changes in spectrometer sensitivity will affect the data quality.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4004/bioprotoc-11-09-4004-g010.jpgFigure 10. Echo-detected field-swept EPR spectrum with the positions of the pump pulse and the probe pulses indicated for different frequency offsets Δν If all measurements on a particular sample have been performed, switch off the membrane pump, wait for the needle of the gasflow controller to drop to zero, and remove the sample rod.At this point, one can either perform PELDOR measurements on another sample, or completely switch off the spectrometer as described in the instrument manual.Note: It is good practice to perform the PELDOR experiment on two to three independently prepared samples to ensure data reliability and reproducibility."
