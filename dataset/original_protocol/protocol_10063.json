    "1. Nanoparticle synthesis by rapid solvent shifting technique\nSet up the following for the nanoparticles' preparation: a block heater/sample concentrator, a desiccator, a digital dispensing system with a 1 mL glass syringe, a 12 mL glass vial, a magnetic stirrer, a magnetic flea (15 mm x 4.5 mm, in a cylindrical shape with polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] coating) inside the glass vial, and a rotatory evaporator.\nDispense 2.4 mL of 250 µM falcarindiol stock dissolved in 70% EtOH water mixture in a scintillation vial.\nEvaporate the liquid fraction, using the sample concentrator for approximately 4 h, to obtain dry falcarindiol.\n\t\nInsert the scintillation vial in the block heater; the sample concentrator delivers gas over the sample using stainless steel needles, concentrating the sample. Evaporate at room temperature; do not use heat.\nOnce dried, add the following components of the lipid coating into the above-mentioned scintillation vial: 16.3 µL of 31.64 mM DSPC chloroform stock solution, 3.4 µL of 17.82 mM DSPE PEG 2000 chloroform stock solution, 24 µL of 25 mM cholesterol chloroform stock solution, and 6 µL of 4 mM DiI chloroform stock solution. Clean the syringe with chloroform after adding each component to avoid cross contamination. \n\tCAUTION: Immediately close the vials containing the lipids so that the solvent does not evaporate and, thereby, modify the concentration. Work in a fume hood.\n\tNOTE: The concentrations of chloroform stock solutions can vary, depending upon the chemical supplier or dilutions made in the lab.\nWrap the vial with aluminum foil to protect DiI from light. Leave the sample overnight in the desiccator to evaporate the chloroform.",
    "Dissolve the desiccated sample in absolute ethanol to a final volume of 1.2 mL, which gives final concentrations of DSPC, DSPE PEG 2000, cholesterol, and DiI of 0.43 mM, 0.05 mM, 0.5 mM, and 0.02 mM, respectively. This solution represents the organic phase.\nTake the 12 mL glass vial, fill it with 9 mL of purified water and, add the magnetic flea into the vial containing 9 mL of water. Keep the vial on the magnetic stirrer, stirring at 500 rpm (Figure 1).\nAttach the 1 mL glass syringe to the dispensing system and clean it with chloroform to avoid any contamination. This by, slowly pulling the chloroform into the glass syringe and dispensing manually into a waste collector  at least 10 tiems.\n\tCAUTION: This must be done under a fume hood.\nPrime the syringe with ethanol. Priming replaces the old solvent, as well as removes any air bubbles.\n\tCAUTION: This must be done under a fume hood.\nUsing the syringe, aspirate 1 mL of the organic phase.\nInsert the syringe into the glass vial, up to the middle of the 9 mL watermark, and maintain it steady in the middle of the vial (as shown in Figure 1).\nInject the solution at the selected speed of injection (833 µL/s) by pressing the dispense button on the dispensing system (Figure 2). This generates 10 mL of 50 µM lipid-coated nanoparticles of falcarindiol in 10% ethanol-containing water.\n\tNOTE: This injection speed has been found to achieve the finest particles, obtaining a narrow particle size distribution. It is critical to make sure that the syringe is in the center, steady, and straight when dispensing the solution.\nImmediately after the injection, remove the vial from the stirrer and transfer the sample to a 50 mL round-bottom flask (RBF).",
    "Attach the RBF to the rotary evaporator and evaporate 1 mL of the organic solvent, using the rotary evaporator at room temperature. Avoid excess bubble formation.\n\tNOTE: This step will take ~5 min.\nTransfer the nanoparticle suspension from the RBF to another 12 mL glass vial. Ensure that the volume is 9 mL. Split the sample in two 12 mL glass vials (put 4.5 mL in each).\nAdd 0.5 mL of ultrapure water to one of the vials and 0.5 mL of 10x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to the other vial. Take out 1 mL of each sample for the particle size measurement.\n2. Particle size analysis using the DLS technique\nNOTE: Size measurements were carried out by using a DLS analyzer which determines particle size distributions. It is equipped with a 100 mW laser that operates at a wavelength of 662.2 nm and with an avalanche photodiode detector placed at a 90° angle to the incident angle. The beam is scattered by the nanoparticles and detected by the photodetector.\nTurn on the DLS instrument and set the desired temperature at 20 °C, until it stabilizes.\nSet the instrument parameters as follows: data acquisition time = 4 s, number of acquisitions = 30, auto-attenuation function = On, and the auto-attenuation time limits = 0.\nFill the plastic cuvette with 1 mL of nanoparticle suspension and start the measurement.\nReport the measured size depending on the solvent used (water or PBS).\n\tNOTE: The measurement in PBS is made to have an approximate idea of the size of the cells in the medium when treating the cells. The cell treatment will be done with the nanoparticles dissolved in water.\nRepeat the measurements 24 h after the synthesis, to check for particle aggregation.\n3. Cell treatment",
    "Grow hMSCs in minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, in a humified chamber at 37°C with 5% CO2.\n\tCAUTION: Work in the sterile Laminar Flow Hood for steps 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3.\nSeed approximately 50,000 cells to obtain a cell density of approximately 30% on previously absolute-EtOH-sterilized #1.5 coverslips placed in 6-well plates. Add MEM in order to have a final volume of 3 mL in each well. Incubate for 24 h under the same conditions as in step 3.1. Seed the cells 24 h before the treatment.\n\tNOTE: It is critical the cells are seeded at least 24 h before the nanoparticle treatment, to make sure that the cells are in an adequate confluence.\nWithout removing the medium, add 3 µL of the nanoparticle solution, for a final falcarindiol concentration of 5 µM. Incubate for 24 h in the same conditions as in step 3.1.\n\tNOTE: The nanoparticles' preparation was carried out on the day of the cell treatment, to avoid particle aggregation.\nSubsequently, after 24 h of treatment, wash the cells 2x with PBS, fix them in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature, and store them in PBS at 4°C for up to several months until imaged.\n\tCAUTION: This must be done under a fume hood.\n\t\nAlternatively, after fixation, a 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) nuclear staining can be performed. For this, after fixing the cells, permeabilize them with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, wash them 2x with PBS, and stain them with 250 µL of 300 nM DAPI for 5 minutes, protected from light.\n4. Microscopy\nFluorescence microscopy\nUse a widefield fluorescence microscope equipped with an electron-multiplied CCD camera to acquire images. Use the 150x NA 1.45 oil objective and the GFP LP channel.\nConfocal microscopy",
    "Acquire confocal microscopy images, using the 63x NA 1.4 oil objective, an Argon laser (514 nm) for DiI, and a two-photon laser (780 nm) for DAPI, to verify the uptake of the nanoparticles into the cells.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
