    "Purification of monomeric BSA by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC)Fraction V, lyophilized BSA contains BSA dimers and trimers in addition to 66 kDa BSA monomers. It also contains H2O and other unknown low molecular weight excipients.Preparation of crude BSA for SECAdd 3 ml 0.154 M NaCl, 5.6 mM Na2HPO4, and 1.06 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.4 (PBS) to a 15 ml conical tube (see Recipes).Weigh ~60 mg BSA in a weigh boat using an analytical balance.Add the BSA to the conical tube. It dissolves readily.Wash the weigh boat with the BSA solution to collect more material. Add to the conical tube.Measure the concentration of BSA.Make a 1/50 dilution in PBS.Read the absorbance at 280 nm and 320 nm.Calculate the concentration of BSA in mg/ml:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20211018/20211018000911_0008.png where b is the pathlength and using an extinction coefficient at 280 nm, ε280, of 0.678 (mg/ml)-1 cm-1 for BSA. Multiply by the dilution factor to get the concentration of undiluted BSA. It should be about 12 mg/ml.Soak an 8 in. length of SpectraPor 16 mm diameter dialysis tubing in H2O for ~30 min.Rinse the tubing with approximately 50 ml of H2O, then once with 10 ml PBS.Knot one end of the tubing with three knots, add 3 ml of the BSA solution and seal by adding three knots to the other end of the tubing.Dialyze against 1 L PBS for 6 h, then overnight against 1 L fresh PBS at room temperature. Use a 1 L beaker covered with Parafilm on a stir plate with a stir bar rotating to gently swirl the dialysis tubing.After dialysis is complete, carefully cut the top of dialysis tubing with scissors, remove the BSA solution with a pipet, and add to a 5 ml test tube.Measure the BSA concentration as described above to check for loss of material.",
    "SEC of BSAWash and equilibrate a Superdex 200 SEC column at 1 ml/min with 60 ml H2O, followed by 60 ml 0.5 M NaOH, 60 ml H2O, and 375 ml PBS, all at room temperature.Load ~1.5 ml of ~12 mg/ml BSA at 1 ml/min using a sample loop.Collect 45 ml in a single fraction and collect 0.8 ml fractions at 1 ml/min.Read the A280/320 of peak fractions (Figure 1).Pool the central eight fractions from the major peak into a 50 ml conical tube.Measure the concentration spectrophotometrically, as described above.Dilute to 0.53 mg/ml by adding the PBS SEC buffer.Confirm the concentration spectrophotometrically.Add 0.5 ml aliquots to 1.5 ml bullet tubes, place in a freezer box, and place in a -80°C freezer.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4195/bioprotoc-11-20-4195-g001.jpgFigure 1. Superdex 200 SEC of BSA Dynamic Light ScatteringThe Zetasizer Nano S DLS instrument (Figure 2) uses a 632.8 nm He Ne red laser. It houses a single cuvette and measures light scattered at 173°. It is interfaced to a computer running Windows 10 and controlled with Zetasizer software. The scattering volume in the cuvette is automatically determined to allow for a large range of particle concentrations. Alternatively, the user can specify the position manually. A measurement consists of several averaged normalized intensity autocorrelation decays, called runs, each lasting 10 s. The number of measurements is specified by the user. The number of runs can either be determined automatically by the software based on the intensity of scattered light, which depends on the concentration and size of the macromolecule, or entered manually by the user. For BSA at 0.53 mg/ml, the number of runs is typically around 15. The runs are averaged in a manner that is not well described in the instrument documentation to produce a single z-average particle radius and polydispersity index.",
    "Additionally, the software produces an intensity particle diameter that is calculated using a user-specified algorithm that inverts the Fredholm integral (Eq. 14).  In this protocol, a frozen BSA sample is thawed and prepared for analysis by ultrafiltration and high-speed centrifugation to remove possible large interfering scattering particles, as described below. A trial of four measurements is made on an aliquot. This process was repeated with fresh aliquots from the same thawed bullet tube for a total of eight trials to assess the variation due to aliquoting. Additionally, another sample of BSA is thawed and also subjected to eight trials, each with four measurements to assess possible variation due to freezing, thawing, and sample preparation.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4195/bioprotoc-11-20-4195-g002.jpgFigure 2.

The SOP specifies 1) the temperature and solvent viscosity, on which the diffusion rate depends and which are required for the calculation of hydrodynamic radius (Eq. 4), 2) the solvent refractive index, which is required for the calculation of the scattering vector (Eq.",
    "11), 3) the number of measurements, and 4) the algorithm used in the calculation of the intensity distribution (Eq. 14). The viscosity for most common buffers can be estimated using SEDNTERP. Alternatively, it can be measured using a viscometer. The latter is preferable because errors due to the preparation of the buffer are not identified by SEDNTERP. The refractive index of buffers near physiologic ionic strength is only slightly increased from water, which is 1.333 at 632.8 nm laser wavelength and 20°C. For PBS used in this protocol, a value of 1.334 is used.Select File > New > SOP.

Do not fully expel the contents to avoid air bubbles.",
    "This volume leaves the meniscus in the viewing window of the cuvette, which is satisfactory. It is acceptable if the meniscus is uneven.Cap the cuvette and place in the Zetasizer Nano S instrument.After the measurements (see below), remove and dispel the old sample, repeating the extraction once. If repeating a trial with the same material, simply add 20 μl of fresh sample. If adding a solution containing a different macromolecule or concentration, wash the cell three times with 20 μl of the new solution, extracting the washes as described above, and then add 20 μl for measurement.Making DLS measurementsWhen the Zetasizer software is started, a window appears entitled “Example results,” which lists several records. Close the window by selecting File > Close. Initially, the arrow next to Browse for SOP… on the Toolbar is greyed out (Figure 5A).Select File > New > Measurement file and give the file a name. A .dts file will be created.Save the file in the folder \\Malvern Instruments\\Zetasizer\\Measurement Data. The small arrow next to Browse for SOP… becomes green (Figure 5B).Click on the small green arrow. A window appears for the selection of the SOP.Navigate to \\Malvern Instruments\\Zetasizer\\SOP\\Protein and select the appropriate SOP file. A Documentation window appears (Figure 5C). Enter a name for the sample. If a window appears that does not have OK at the bottom, selecting the SOP has been done incorrectly. Repeat the steps above.After selecting OK, a window appears with a big green arrow (Figure 5D). Click it to start the set of measurements. Initially, when the arrow is clicked, the measurements start after the user-specified equilibration period. On repeat trials, a message appears directing the user to insert the cell. After inserting the cell, click the big green arrow again, and the measurements will start.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4195/bioprotoc-11-20-4195-g005.jpgFigure 5.

(D) Big green start arrow.As a series of runs accumulates into a measurement, select Intensity PSD, and a graph appears showing the distribution analysis as Intensity versus Size and cumulant analysis, showing the Z-average diameter and polydispersity index Figure 6A. At the completion of the run, the distribution function is calculated, and Intensity vs. Size is plotted. Then another run is executed, with continual updating of the intensity vs. size graph until the runs have been completed, which constitutes a single measurement.Alternatively, during measurements, select Multi-View, and a window appears showing: 1)  g2(τ) –1 versus decay time τ, which is updated as a run evolves; 2) the intensity fluctuations described in Background; and 3) the intensity distribution (Figure 6B). The intensity distribution for a monodisperse protein preparation should be monomodal and symmetric, as shown in Figures 6A and 6B. An example of polydisperse sample is shown in Figure 7, which was prepared by mixing BSA with thyroglobulin. If the intensity distribution is multimodal, the sample preparation should be repeated.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4195/bioprotoc-11-20-4195-g006.jpgFigure 6.
