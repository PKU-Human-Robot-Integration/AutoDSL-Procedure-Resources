This will result in more accurate cell counting and provide an even monolayer when seeding.\nNote: The cell dilution above is equal to plating 2.5 × 104 cells per well. You will need approximately 5 mL of cells per plate.\nDay 2\nSample dilution\nTiming: Approximately 2 h (add 10 min per extra plate)\nThis step describes the serial dilution of patient samples in a separate 96-well plate (U- or V-bottom plate).\nIn a sterile 96-well U- or V-bottom plate (Corning Falcon, Cat. No. 08-772-54), add 33.6 μL of infection media to row A (Columns 1–10) and row E (columns 1–10). Add 28 μL of infection media to the remaining wells. Add 1.4 μL of plasma sample to row A (columns 1–10) and row E (columns 1–10). Duplicates can be side by side (wells A1 and A2) or vertically (wells A1 and E1) (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2188-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. A visual layout showing how much infection media (μL) to add to a sterile 96-well plate\nNote: Dilution described above is 1:25 dilution.",
    "Perform a 5-fold serial dilution by transferring 7 μL of the plasma/infection media from row A down to row D. Perform the same serial dilution for the duplicate from row E down to row H. Discard the last 7 μL so that all wells have a total volume of 28 μL.\nMake a master mix of the two SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses, each containing a unique fluorophore (eGFP and mCherry) at a 1:1 ratio. Ideally, titers should be at 50–100 ffu per 25 μL in infection media.\nNote: 2.5 mL of pseudovirus are required for each 96-well plate.\nAdd 25 μL of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses from row D up to row A and from row H up to row E. For column 11 add 25 μL of virus; this will be the virus only control. For column 12, add 25 μL of infection media; this will be the cells only control.\nCritical: Add the virus from the most diluted plasma to the least diluted plasma (row D to A; row H to E) to prevent potential carry-over of highly neutralizing antibodies (if done the opposite way) that may skew the neutralization curve.\nCover the dilution plate and incubate at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 1 h.\nPre-incubation and infection\nTiming: Approximately 15 min is required to prepare one 96-well plate; add 7 min per additional plate\nThis step describes the infection of the target cells.\nWash the half area 96-well plate containing the Vero E6 hACE T2A TMPRSS2 target cells with 50 μL of 1× PBS twice to remove residual growth media, but gently without disturbing the cells.",
    "Transfer 50 μL of the pre-incubated plasma-virus mixture from rows A to D of the U- or V-bottom plates to its corresponding wells of the 96-well plate containing Vero E6 hACE T2A TMPRSS2 target cells with a multichannel pipette. To decrease risk of cross-contamination, change tips for each row. In a similar manner, transfer plasma/virus mixture from rows E to H for the duplicate sample.\nCritical: To minimize plastic waste, one can transfer the plasma-pseudovirus mixture from the least diluted to the most diluted plasma sample (row A to D, row E to H) without changing tips. The row with the least diluted plasma (row A or E), hypothetically has the least amount of infectious viruses and the most diluted (row D or H), has the largest amount of infectious virus. By contrast, if the mixture is transferred from the most diluted (row D or H) to the least diluted plasma (row A or E), non-neutralized virus is potentially transferred up the wells and can skew the neutralization data.\nIncubate (infection) at 37°C and 5% CO2.\nRead plates at 16- to 24-h post infection.\nDay 3\nRead plate using Celigo Image Cytometer\nTiming: Approximately 20 min per plate\nThis section describes how to measure fluorescence via a Celigo Image Cytometer.\nApproximately 16–24 h post infection, place the plate in the Celigo Image Cytometer.\nStart the Celigo cytometer system according to standard protocol and select “Create New.”\nChoose the correct plate type and create a unique Plate ID. Once completed, select “Load Plate.”\nNote: Consider using plates that are supported by the Celigo Image Cytometer.",
    "In the “Scan” tab, under “Application,” select “Expression Analysis,” and “Target 1 + 2 + 3” as there are three channels needed for performing two-color fluorescence analysis. One channel is dedicated to brightfield (BF), and a second and third channel to the detection of the two fluorophores.\nClick the yellow finger icon next to “Application” to name your different channels.\nIt is advisable to label them as: i) BF, ii) color 1 (e.g., eGFP) and iii) color 2 (e.g., red fluorescent protein for mCherry) as it will prevent confusion when assigning the color filter (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) and during analysis.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2188-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Label each channel with the appropriate nomenclature to prevent confusion when performing analysis (e.g., BF = brightfield, GFP = green fluorescent protein and RFP = red fluorescent protein).\nSelect BF as your first channel and under “Motion Control” select “Focus Setup” and “Register Auto”. Set a minor offset (-5 to -10) using the down arrow next to “Auto Focus.”\nNote: Setting a slight offset helps with the counting efficiency.\nFor the first fluorescence analysis, select your second channel, and specific to this protocol, we labeled it as “GFP VOC 1” since it was a pseudovirus that encodes the eGFP gene pseudotyped with the S of a VOC. Then choose the ‘Green 483/536’ under illumination and exposure time (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2188-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Assigning and labeling Channel 2 with a specific laser that will detect a fluorophore (e.g., GFP)\nSelect “Find Focus” after proper exposure.\nThen select “Set Offset”.\nFor the second fluorescence analysis, select your third channel, and specific to this protocol, we labeled it as “mCherry VOC 2” since it was a pseudovirus that encodes mCherry gene pseudotyped with the S of another VOC. Then choose ‘Red 531/629’ under illumination and exposure time (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2188-Fig4.jpg",
    "Figure 4. Assigning and labeling Channel 3 with a specific laser that will detect a second fluorophore (e.g., RFP)\nSelect “Find Focus” after proper exposure.\nThen select “Set Offset”.\nNote: We found an exposure time of 35,000 μs for eGFP (Green 483/536) and 100,000 μs for mCherry (Red 531/629) to be the optimal length of exposure time for our work.\nHighlight all the wells using your cursor, ensuring that all wells light up yellow and select “Start Scan” (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2188-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Press ‘Selection’ and then highlight by dragging the pointer to select all the wells in the 96-well plate\nSelected wells will turn yellow as shown above.\nTo start the analysis, complete the following:\nUnder the “Analysis Settings” select “Well Mask” and set the “% Well Mask” to 100%.\nUnder “Identification”, ensure correct channel is selected and set the “Cell Diameter” to 15 μm.\nUnder “Pre-Filtering” set the “Cell Area” to 40 μm2.\nExport the data by selecting “Export Well-Level Data.”"
