    "Whole cell lysate preparation for in vivo detection of BvgA phosphorylation Note: This protocol has been successfully used with another gram-negative bacteria, E. coli.   To collect bacteria sample, Bordetella pertussis strain BP536, grown at 37 °C for 2 days on BG agar plate, is swabbed from the plate with a polyester-tipped applicator and resuspended in 1.5 ml of PBS.   An aliquot from step A1 is used to determine the OD600 reading.   A 0.3 ml aliquot from step A1 is centrifuged at 15,600 x g in Eppendorf microfuge for 1 min at room temperature. The supernatant is removed, and the resulting pellet is frozen in dry ice. It can be used directly or stored at -80 °C.   The frozen pellet is treated as follows.  Note: Volumes are based on an OD600 reading of 0.5 and a pellet obtained from 0.3 ml, one should adjust the volumes proportionally based on the determined OD600. First, 33 μl of ice-cold 1 M formic acid is added, and the pellet is disrupted by pipetting repeatedly. Immediately, a freshly made ice-cold solution (27 μl) containing 2 μl of 5 N NaOH (to neutralize the acid), 10 μl H2O, and 15 μl of 5x Loading Solution is added.  Note: The color of the solution turns yellow due to the acid, but the bromophenol blue changes back to blue once it enters the gel.    4 μl of the resulting cell lysate are loaded onto the Phos-tagTM gel for electrophoresis. Note: Do not boil the treated cell lysate; the lysate should be kept on ice before loading.

    "For resolving gel: Acrylamide, Tris, SDS, Phos-tagTM, Zn(NO3)2, and H2O are mixed. 10% APS and TEMED are added, and the solution is immediately poured into the gel cassette. The solution is then overlaid with 1 ml of water-saturated butanol. The resolving gel polymerizes in ~40 min at room temperature.   The butanol is poured off of the polymerized resolving gel, and the gel surface is then washed with water. Excess water is removed using absorbent paper.   For stacking gel: Acrylamide, Tris, SDS, and H2O are mixed. 10% APS and TEMED are added, and the solution is immediately poured into the gel cassette. The comb is quickly inserted (avoiding the introduction of air bubbles) and the stacking gel is allowed to polymerize for 20 min at room temperature.   After insertion of the gel cassette into the electrophoresis apparatus, the ice-cold 1x MOPS Running Buffer is added. The entire apparatus is then placed into an ice-filled bucket and the bucket is placed on a platform shaker so that it can be gently rotated until the temperature of the Running Buffer in the chamber has cooled to 4 °C. This typically takes at least 30 min.  Note: Place only one gel cassette in one XCell SureLock® Mini-Cell to ensure that the temperature remains cold during electrophoresis.    The shaker is turned off and the samples are loaded using a pipetman.   After resumption of gentle shaking, electrophoresis is performed with constant 100 V for 30 min, 120 V for 30 min, and then 150 V until the bromophenol blue dye is ~ 1 cm from the bottom of the gel. (Temperature within the inner gel chamber will rise to 10 °C to 15 °C.",
    ")   For Western blot analysis, the gel is washed with 100 ml Transfer Buffer containing 1 mM EDTA for 10 min to remove Zn2+ from the gel, followed by washing again with 100 ml Transfer Buffer for 20 min.   The gel is transferred to a PVDF filter, which was previously rinsed with methanol and then with Transfer Buffer, in a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II apparatus filled with ice-cold Transfer Buffer at 100 constant voltage for 1 h at 4 °C.   The antibody detection of BvgA is carried out at room temperature as follows: After the transfer, the PVDF filter is blocked by washing with 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h, and then incubated with monoclonal anti-BvgA antibody (1:5,000) in 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h. Three 10-min washes with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS are conducted before incubation with HRP-conjugated Secondary Antibody (1:2,000) in 1% non-fat milk in PBS for 1 h. The PVDF filter is washed three times for 10 min, each, with 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS, and then developed with Amersham ECL Primer Western Blotting Detection System, according to the manufacture’s instruction.       Separation of in vitro phosphorylated purified protein   To phosphorylate in vitro, 9 μl purified BvgA (from ~1 to 25 pmol) is mixed with 1 μl 200 mM acetyl phosphate on ice and then incubated for the desired amount of time at 37 °C.   Reaction is stopped by placing the sample on dry ice.   Sample is mixed with 2.5 μl 5x Loading Solution (final concentration of 1x), separated on PhostagTM acrylamide gel, washed, and detected by Western analysis as described above.   Alternately, gel can be stained. In this case, the gel is first washed 3 times in 100 ml of water for 10 min. The gel is then treated with Colloidal Blue following manufacturer’s instructions.",
    "Note: For best results, use either Colloidal Blue or classic Coomassie blue staining rather than other types of protein stains.   Note: The optimal level of purified protein for loading is ~ 1 pmol for Western analysis and ~25 pmol for gel staining   imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20131120/20131120180413_2557.jpg Figure 1. Separation of phosphorylated BvgA from unphosphorylated BvgA by Phos-tagTM SDS-PAGE, analyzed by Western blot. First lane shows the in vivo lysate of B. pertussis, which contains both phosphorylated BvgA (BvgA~P) and nonphosphorylated BvgA (BvgA). Lanes 2 and 3 show purified BvgA, which has been phosphorylated in vitro by the addition of acetyl phosphate or incubated in the absence of acetyl phosphate, respectively."
