    "All animal-handling procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Incheon National University (INU-ANIM-2017-08).\n1. Animal preparation for surgery\nNOTE: Use Sprague Dawley Rat (8-10 weeks old) without the sex bias for this experiment.\nAnesthetize the rat with 90 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine cocktail intraperitoneally. To maintain the desired depth of anesthesia throughout the surgery, provide a supplemental 45 mg/kg ketamine and 5 mg/kg xylazine cocktail when the rat shows signs of waking up.\nConfirm that the rat is under deep anesthesia and regularly check body reflections such as toe pinch, tail pinch, and corneal reflex.\nShave the fur between the eyes and the back of the ears using a trimmer.\nApply an ophthalmic ointment onto the eyes to prevent them from drying out.\n2. Surgery for cortical surface exposure\nFix the rat head on the stereotaxic apparatus with a stereotaxic adaptor. To maintain the body temperature of 37 °C during the surgery, place the rat on a temperature-controlled heating pad.\nSterilize the shaved area with alternating scrubs of alcohol and povidone-iodine three times.\nUse forceps to grasp the scalp firmly and inject 0.1 mL of lidocaine (2%) with a syringe directly into the scalp to induce local anesthesia in the surgery area.\nMake a 2-3 cm long midline incision with a scalpel and pull apart the scalp to expose the skull.\nClamp the scalp with mosquito forceps to expose the skull.\nScratch the surface of the skull with forceps to remove the periosteum.\nBlunt dissect the muscles over the occipital skull to expose the cisterna magna above the axis on the top of the spinal cord.",
    "Incise the cisterna magna with the blade to drain the cerebrospinal fluid and put a sterile gauze inside the incision of the cisterna magna to absorb the cerebrospinal fluid constantly to prevent brain edema and minimize inflammation.\nUsing a pencil, mark on the skull a rectangular window measuring 3 mm in the anteroposterior axis and 6 mm in the right lateral direction from the bregma of the right hemisphere.\n\tNOTE: Marking must secure a 1 mm distance from the midline to avoid superior sagittal sinus rupture.\nDrill the marked area according to the stereotaxic coordinate and remove the skull with a bone rongeur.\nTo remove the dura mater, bend the tip of the 26 G needle to 90°, create a hole in the dura mater, lift the dura mater, insert forceps into that hole, and tear it with forceps.\nPlace saline-wetted gauze on the somatosensory cortex to prevent it from drying out.\n3. Preparation of graphene electrode array connected to the recording system\nPrepare a graphene electrode array with an omnetics connector.\n\t\nDetach the graphene multielectrode array without causing damage by applying the saline solution.\nRemove the outer covering of the reference and ground wires from the connector.\nConnect the head stage with the graphene electrode array to the connector.\nPlug the interface cable linked to the head stage into the recording system.\nSecure the graphene electrode array complex into the stereotaxic arm.\nTo capture neural signals from all channels, position the array on the somatosensory cortex without any bending, following the predetermined stereotaxic coordinates.\nPlace a reference wire underneath the tissue behind the occipital bone and connect the ground wire to the grounded optical table.\n4. Physical stimulation and recording SEPs for mapping\nOpen the neural signal recording software.",
    "Set the recording software environment: (1) set the sampling rate for SEPs and notch filter (60 or 50 Hz, a frequency of household electrical power) to remove the noise from the power line.\nFor whisker mapping, bend the whisker with a fine stick.\nConstantly poke the forepaw, forelimb, hind paw, hindlimb, and trunk with a wooden stick for body mapping.\nRecord neural signals in the data acquisition system for the indicated time.\n5. Animal euthanasia\nAfter all the recording procedures, sacrifice the rats with anesthesia using >5% isoflurane and perform cervical dissection.\n6. SEP measurement for cortical mapping\nOpen MATLAB code-named read_Intan_RHS2000_file.m for signal analysis.\n\tNOTE: read_Intan_RHS2000_file.m can be downloaded from \"https://intantech.com/downloads.html?tabSelect=Software”.\nClick the Run button, select the recording file with the \".rhs\" filename extension, and wait for the file to be processed and read.\nEnter the command \"plot (t, amplifier_data(\"channel number\",:))\" to create a 2D line plot of the recording data, find the SEPs, and calculate the amplitude of SEPs in all channels.\n\tNOTE: Enter the channel number at \"channel number.\" For example, \"plot(t, amplifier_data(1,:))\" creates channel 1's 2D line plot. In addition, when the experimenter calculates the amplitude of the response, choose the response recorded from each channel.\nObtain data by coloring the grid with a different hue according to the amplitude of the SEPs.\n\tNOTE: MATLAB command \"imagesc\" helps obtain a topographic map more quickly.\nSubscription Required.
