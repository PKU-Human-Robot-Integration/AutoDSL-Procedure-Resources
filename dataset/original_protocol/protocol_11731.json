    "1. Hydrogel preparation\nNOTE: All steps must be performed in a cell culture hood that has been disinfected with ethanol and ultraviolet (UV)-sterilized before use to maintain sterility. Tools, such as tweezers and pipettes, must be sprayed with ethanol. Buffer solutions must also be sterile-filtered.\nPreparation of aminosilane-coated glass coverslips\n\t\nPlace the desired number of glass coverslips onto a piece of laboratory wipe.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare an additional 3-4 coverslips to ensure sufficient backup supplies as they break easily. Different materials of glass coverslips will yield different compatibility of cell seeding and attachment. It is better to determine which type suits the experiment best before starting the experiments (see the Table of Materials).\nUse an alcohol burner or Bunsen burner to sterilize each coverslip by passing it back and forth through the flame (30 s for protein assay experiments). Place each glass coverslip on a laboratory wipe to cool down.\nOnce the glass coverslips are cooled down, transfer them onto a Petri dish lined with parafilm to prevent slippage.\n\t\tNOTE: If the coverslips are not cool enough, the residual heat will melt the parafilm onto the slips, rendering them unusable.\nCover the coverslips with approximately 200 μL and 800 μL of 0.1 M NaOH for a 12 mm and a 25 mm coverslip, respectively, and let them sit for 5 min. Then, aspirate the 0.1 M NaOH and allow the coverslips to air-dry for another 5 min to form an even film.\nOnce the coverslips are dried, pipette approximately 80 μL and 150 μL of 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTS) for 12 mm and 25 mm coverslips, respectively. Be careful to avoid spilling the solution onto the parafilm. Allow the solution to sit for 5 min.",
    "Aspirate as much excess APTS as possible and allow the residual APTS to dry for 5 min. Rinse the coverslips well by submerging them in sterile, deionized (DI) H2O three times for 5 min each time.\n\t\tNOTE: If the glass coverslips are not rinsed well, the residual APTS causes unwanted reactions with glutaraldehyde, causing a white precipitate to form and resulting in unusable coverslips.\nMove the coverslips to a new Petri dish with the reactive side facing up. Add enough 0.5% glutaraldehyde to the Petri dish to cover the coverslips entirely and allow the coverslips to sit for 30 min.\nAspirate the 0.5% glutaraldehyde and rinse the coverslips again in DI H2O one time for 3 min. Set the coverslips reactive side up on a laboratory wipe or a clean Petri dish to air-dry completely before using.\n\t\tNOTE: The protocol can be paused here; coverslips must be placed in sterile DI H2O until use.\nPreparation of siliconized coverslips\n\t\nPlace the same number of coverslips as the aminosilane-coated coverslips (step 1.1.1) in a Petri dish lined with parafilm.\nPipette 40 μL or 150 μL for 12 mm and 25 mm coverslips, respectively, of dichloromethylsilane (DCMS) to one side of the coverslip and allow the solution to sit for 5 min.\nAspirate any remaining solution from the coverslip, wash in sterile DI H2O once for 1 min, and place the reactive coverslips face up on a laboratory wipe to air-dry completely before moving onto the next step.\nPreparing hydrogels\n\t\nMix acrylamide, bis-acrylamide, and DI H2O in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube to prepare 500 μL of solutions with varying stiffnesses (see Table 1). Vortex the solution for 30 s to mix it thoroughly.",
    "Working swiftly, add the 10% ammonium persulfate solution (APS) and tetramethylethylenediamine (TEMED) to the tube and vortex the solutions again to mix the solutions.\n\t\tNOTE: Prepare fresh 10% APS and leave it on ice or freeze into single-use aliquots due to its sensitive freeze/thaw cycle.\nPipette approximately 33 μL or 100 μL of the solution onto the dried 12 mm or 25 mm aminosilane-coated coverslips (section 1.1), respectively.\nUsing curved tweezers, immediately place the DCMS-treated coverslip on top of the gel solution with the treated side touching the gel solution, thus sandwiching the gel solution between the DCMS-treated coverslip and aminosilane-coated coverslip.\nAllow the gel solution to polymerize for 5-15 min, while actively monitoring for gel polymerization of the leftover solution in the tube.\nOnce the gel is polymerized, separate the DCMS-treated coverslip with curved tweezers or a razor blade, leaving the gel attached to the original aminosilane-coated coverslip.\nImmediately place the coverslip with the attached hydrogel in a predetermined 4-well/24-well and 6-well plate covered with 500 µL and 2 mL of sterile PBS or DI H2O for 12 mm and 25 mm coverslips, respectively, to prevent the gel from drying out.\nRepeat steps 1.3.4-1.3.7 for all coverslips.\nSubmerge the hydrogels in sterile PBS or DI H2O for 30 min to remove excess acrylamide solution. Store the hydrogels in sterile PBS or DI H2O at 4 °C for a procedural stop here.\nIn a dark room, prepare the sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(4'-azido-2'-nitrophenylamino) hexanoate (sulfo-SANPAH) mixture by mixing 2.5 mL of 50 mM 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl) piperazin-1-yl] ethanesulfonic acid(HEPES) (pH=8.5) with 25 μL of the 50 μg/mL sulfo-SANPAH in a conical tube, wrapped in aluminum foil to protect from light. Use a pipette to mix the solution well before using.",
    "NOTE: A volume of 2.5 mL of sulfo-SANPAH solution is enough for approximately twenty-five 12 mm hydrogels or five 25 mm hydrogels.\nAspirate PBS or DI H2O from the well plate. Add approximately 100 μL or 500 μL for 12 mm and 25 mm coverslips, respectively, of sulfo-SANPAH solution (step 1.3.10) to cover the gel. Ensure the solution covers the gel entirely.\n\t\tNOTE: Adjust the vacuum suction strength to prevent the strong force from ripping or disturbing the hydrogels.\nPlace the gels with the solution under a 15 W, 365 nm UV light for 10 min, uncovered to minimize any interference of the UV light reacting with the sulfo-SANPAH.\nAspirate the excess sulfo-SANPAH by tilting the plate to collect as much of the solution as possible. Wash the gel with 50 mM HEPES two to three times.\nAdd 500 μL and 2 mL for 12 mm and 25 mm gels, respectively, of 50 mg/mL collagen I diluted in 0.2% acetic acid to each well containing the hydrogel. Allow the gels to incubate overnight in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: Dilute collagen I in 0.2% acetic acid instead of 50 mM HEPES to promote homogenous distribution and attachment of collagen I.\nAspirate the collagen I and wash the gels with sterile PBS three times to remove excess collagen I for 5 min each wash. Incubate the hydrogels in PBS with 10% horse serum, 5% FBS for 2 h in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.\n\t\tNOTE: The addition of 10% horse serum promotes higher proliferation compared to only using FBS as done in the previous publication.",
    "Aspirate the medium. Add 500 mL of sterile-filtered Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (P/S) to each well. Store the gels in the 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator until ready for cell culture.\nOnce ready, plate approximately 1.5 × 104 O9-1 cells/cm2 in basal medium in the culture dishes. Incubate the cells for 2 days in an incubator at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Check the cells for confluency to ensure that the cells are sufficiently attached to gels, and that the number of cells is enough before collecting for analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: See the previously published protocol for the steps of recovery, passage, and collection of O9-1 cells20.\nProceed to sections 2, 3, or 4 for further analysis of the hydrogels.\n2. Quantitative analysis of stiffness via AFM\nStart the AFM system computer, followed by the AFM controller (see the Table of Materials).\nMount the AFM cantilever on the AFM probe holder. Use a spherical cantilever with a 0.5 μm silica bead mounted at the end of the cantilever (cantilever with spherical bead).\n\tNOTE: For stiffer hydrogels, such as 10 kPa, 20 kPa, and 40 kPa, a stiffer probe was used with the spring constant of 0.24 N/m. A softer probe was used for softer hydrogels, such as 0.5 kPa and 1 kPa, with a spring constant of 0.059 N/m.\nSet the AFM software under contact mode.\nMount the silicon wafer onto the AFM sample stage to collect force curves by clicking on Engage for the cantilever to touch the silicon substrate, thus generating the force curves.\nUse the force curves above (2.4) for calibration, click on Calibrate in the controlling software to obtain an average spring constant of the cantilever under thermal tune condition, and save the calibrated values in the controlling software.",
    "Mount the samples by placing the coverslip with the attached hydrogel in a 60 mm Petri dish onto the AFM scanning stage. Add 3 mL of PBS into the dish before conducting measurements to prevent the gel from drying out.\nSet the AFM to work in contact mode (fluid) to start measurement. Engage the spherical bead to continuously touch and lift from the gel sample.\nSet the cantilever so that its deflection threshold remains at 10 nm. Keep the ramping size of the probe at 10 μm. Then, record the force curves as in step 2.4.\nAcquire at least 20 force curves from at least 3 to 10 different spots across the surface of the hydrogel.\nCalculate the average Young's modulus of ~20 force curves for each spot with AFM imaging and analysis software. Use extend ramp force curves and a linearized model (spherical). Calculate the average of all spots for each sample to yield the final stiffness.\n\tNOTE: Young's modulus and related data (i.e., standard deviations) are automatically saved as a spreadsheet.\nRepeat steps 2.6-2.10 for all samples.\n3. Molecular analysis of stiffness via immunofluorescence staining\nUse tweezers to transport the coverslip to a new plate to minimize false signals from cells grown directly onto the plate. Wash the cells with 500 µL of sterile PBS three times to remove dead cells and any remaining culture medium.\nFix the cells using 500 µL of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at room temperature, undisturbed. Then, rewash the cells three times using 500 µL of PBS/well for 2 min each.\n\tNOTE: Store at 4 °C for a procedural stop.\nTreat the cells with 500 µL of 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Then, wash the cells three times with 500 µL of PBS/well.",
    "Block the cells with 250 µL of 10% donkey serum (diluted in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20) per well for 30 min at room temperature.\nIncubate the cells with 250 µL of primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Then, wash the cells three times with 500 µL of PBS/well for 5 min each.\n\tNOTE: Anti-Vinculin (Vcl) (1:250) and anti-AP2 alpha (1:250) were used in this experiment and were diluted in 10% donkey serum.\nIncubate the cells with corresponding secondary antibodies and/or phalloidin used for F-actin staining at a dilution of 1:400 in 250 µL of 10% donkey serum for 30 min at room temperature. Then, wash the cells three times with PBS for 5 min each.\n\tNOTE: 568 nm Phalloidin can be co-incubated with 488 nm or 647 nm secondary antibodies or on its own.\nIncubate the cells with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:1000 dilution) in 250 µL of PBS for 10 min followed by one last wash of PBS for 2 min.\nAdd 3-4 drops of mounting medium to each well. Store the samples at 4 °C to set for at least 2 h before imaging to ensure the mounting medium has set properly.\nCapture images of at least 3 random frames per hydrogel sample with a fluorescence microscope, producing individual and merged channels.\n4. Quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR)\nTransfer the hydrogels with the adherent cells for RNA collection to a new plate to minimize unwanted RNA from cells attached to the cell plate. Wash the cells with PBS three times to remove dead cells and culture medium.\nExtract the total mRNA using an RNA extraction kit. Perform reverse-transcription of RNA to cDNA using a reverse transcription supermix following the manufacturer's instructions.",
    "Perform RT-qPCR with primers for Vcl as the stiffness marker of choice and analyze using the 2-ΔΔCT method.\n\tNOTE: Primer sequence of Vcl: Forward 5' GCTTCAGTCAGACCCATACTCG 3'; reverse 5' AGGTAAGCAGTAGGTCAGATGT 3'.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
