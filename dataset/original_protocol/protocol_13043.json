    "1. Device pre-assembly\nLabel the outer ring (30 mm diameter) for sample identification. If necessary, include the project name, device number, crystallization condition, and date (Figure 1A). Place the outer ring upside down on a clean surface (Figure 1B), and carefully place one quartz wafer inside the ring (Figure 1C). This first quartz wafer serves as an entrance window for the incident X-rays.\nPour a small amount of microscope immersion oil (viscosity of 150 cSt) into a Petri dish. Dip a shim in the oil, and make sure that both sides of the shim are properly oiled (Figure 1D). Remove the excess oil by dabbing the shim on a clean surface.\nPlace the oiled shim on top of the first quartz wafer (Figure 1E).\n\t​NOTE: Immersion oil is an excellent sealant that protects the crystallization chamber from potential vapor loss. Properly assembled chips usually last for weeks without visible drying. This pre-assembly step is performed under room light. For light-sensitive samples, all subsequent steps, including sample loading, device storage, and observation, must be carried out under safety light.\n2. Sample loading and device assembly\nUse a pipette to thoroughly mix the protein solution and crystallization buffer on the first quartz wafer. The volume ratio between the protein sample and buffer typically ranges from 2:1 to 1:2 (Figure 1F). Make sure that the total volume of the crystallization solution does not exceed the maximum capacity of the crystallization chamber determined by the shim size and thickness. Avoid air bubbles during mixing.\n\tNOTE: The composition of a crystallization buffer varies from one experiment to another. Refer to Table 1 for crystallization conditions.",
    "Place the second quartz wafer over the mixed solution as the solution starts to spread out (Figure 1G). This second quartz wafer serves as the exit window of the diffracted X-rays.\nTap the second quartz wafer lightly on the edge to help spread the oil while pushing air out. Secure the device by screwing a retaining ring into the outer ring (Figure 1H). Use a tightening tool if necessary (Figure 1I). Be mindful that over-tightening may cause delicate quartz wafers to deform or even crack.\n3. Device storage and crystallization optimization\nStore the assembled devices (Figure 1J) in a box at room temperature or inside an incubator with temperature control.\n\tNOTE: Protein crystals may appear in a few hours to days after a crystallization device is assembled. Typical results from on-chip crystallization are shown for several representative protein samples (Figure 2).\nMonitor crystal growth by observing the crystallization device under a microscope. If necessary, optimize crystallization conditions by iterations of sections 1-3.\n4. Calibration\nNOTE: The programs and commands mentioned in the sections below are run in inSituX software.\nInstall a thin crystal of doped yttrium aluminum garnet on the chip holder (Figure 3). Install the beam stop. Take X-ray fluorescence images of the direct beam by running the program:\nburnmark.py <device>.param\n\twhere <device> is a user-selected name for the crystallization device. <device>.param is a filename that contains device-specific control parameters. The default values will be gradually replaced by specific values along the protocol. A sample <device>.param file is shown in Supplementary File 1.\nFind the precise position of the direct X-ray beam by running the beam profile fitting program:\nbeam.py <burn image> -d <device>\n\twhere <burn image> is the filename of the X-ray fluorescence image (Figure 4).",
    "NOTE: This program calculates the precise direct beam positions as well as the beam size. The beam position marks the translocation destination for all crystals from the same device. The beam size is also used for target planning.\n5. Optical scanning\nPlace a crystallization device in the chip holder and secure the device using a thumbscrew (Figure 3A).\nMount the chip holder onto the translation stage of the diffractometer through a kinematic mechanism (Figure 3B).\nInstall a proper light source for taking micrographs from the optical window of the device. White light, IR light, or other light of choice can be used depending on the light sensitivity of the protein sample as well as the purpose of the experiment.\nRun the scan program:\nscan.py <device>.param\n\tThis program captures a set of micrographs that are automatically transferred to specified user computers.\nRun the tiling program on a user computer:\ntile.py <device> -x <x> -y <y>\n\twhere <x> and <y> are the initial values for column and row displacements of micrographs, respectively. This program stitches all micrographs into a montage of 1-3 μm/pixel resolution (Figure 5).\n\tNOTE: Steps 5.4 and 5.5 usually take a few minutes. The total number of micrographs ranges from several tens to hundreds depending on the scan area and magnification.\nRun the crystal-finding program:\nfindX.py <montage> -c <length> <width> -w <wedge> -x <beam size>",
    "where <montage> is the tiled image. This program performs crystal recognition and shot planning. <length> and <width> indicate the crystal size to be found. If the user wishes to avoid smaller crystals, <width> can be used as a cutoff by setting a number larger than the sizes of unwanted small crystals. <wedge> is an angular value that sets the tolerance for crystals of irregular shape. <beam size> refers to the direct beam size obtained from the profile fitting above (step 4.2; Figure 4). Also, a nominal value can be set by users to further space out targeted shots. These key parameters enable specific crystal selection and target planning (Figure 6).\n6. X-ray diffraction\nRemove the light source and install the beam stop. Set an appropriate detector distance. Follow the beamline safety protocol to search the X-ray hutch. Open the X-ray shutter and laser shutter if applicable.\nRun the data collection program for serial diffraction:\ncollect.py <device>.param -l <light duration>\n\tThis command triggers data collection in which all planned shots are visited one after another according to a preprogrammed sequence. Each targeted crystal is translocated to the beam position (step 4.2). At each stop, X-ray exposure is taken with or without a laser illumination at a scheduled time delay. Movie 1 shows an automated data collection sequence operated at a frequency of 1 Hz. Routinely tens to hundreds of diffraction images are collected from a single crystallization device (Movie 2).\n\tNOTE: Section 4 calibration and section 5 optical scan are self-contained in the inSituX platform, therefore, completely transferable to another beamline. Section 6 X-ray diffraction has to involve some detail in beamline operation.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
