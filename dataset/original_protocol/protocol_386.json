    "**Active induction of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis \\(EAU)**\nEAU was induced with 150&#xB5;g bovine IRBP and 300&#xB5;g human IRBP peptide \\(1-20) in C57bl/6 strain. Disease was induced in B10RIII mice with 150&#xB5;g bovine IRBP and 12-20 &#xB5;g human IRBP peptide \\(161-180) and clinical disease in both strains were established by fundoscopy and histology. Initial signs EAU is observed approximately 7-12 days after immunization, with full-blown disease developing by post-immunization day-14. By day-21 post-immunization there is substantial reduction of inflammatory cells and disease resolution characterized by absence of inflammatory cells or inflammatory cytokines in the retina occurs 28 days post-immunization<sup>6</sup>. \n**Preparation of antigen/CFA emulsion**\n1|  Into a 50 ml polypropylene tube, add 0.5 ml stock bovine IRBP protein \\(6 mg/ml) and 6 mg lyophilized human IRBP peptide \\(1-20) and bring mixture to a final volume of 2 ml\n2|  Add an equal volume or 2 ml of Complete Freund adjuvant \\(CFA) containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Ra \\(2.5 mg/ml), mix and chill on ice for 10 min\n3|  Sonicate at high speed on ice for 20 seconds followed by 30 seconds intervals \n4|  Repeat 4-5 times until the mixture appears as a thick white cream.\n5|  Centrifuge at 1200 RPM for 1 min.\n6|  Prepare CFA emulsion without IRBP to serve as control.\n7|  Transfer emulsion into in 1 ml syringes with 19 gauge blunt-ended needles \n8|  Prepare PTX \\(2 ug/ml) solution in 1 ml syringes with 25 gauge needles \n**Immunization** \n1|  Prepare sufficient PTX \\(2 ug/ml) solution \\(100&#xB5;l/mouse) \n2|  Prepare sufficient CFA/Antigen emulsions \\(200&#xB5;l/mouse)\n3|  Before injections expel any air bubble in the syringe containing PTX or emulsion\n4|  Inject each mouse with PTX solution \\(100 &#xB5;l) intraperitoneally\n5|  Inject emulsion subcutaneously into base of tail \\(100 &#xB5;l) and each thigh \\(50 &#xB5;l)",
    "6|  Sacrifice the immunized at post-immunization day-7, -14, -21, and -28.\nControls: Un-immunized WT mice; mice immunized with CFA emulsion \\(without IRBP)\n**Clinical grading of mice with EAU by fundoscopy**\n1|  Restrain mice by anethesia: intraperitoneal injection of mixture of Ketamine and xylazine \\(Rompun) at 30 mg/kg and 9 mg/kg, respectively. \n2|  After 5-10 min, dilate pupils by applying 1 drop of Mydriacyl \\(1%) to each eye. \n3|  Gently press the cover glass on the cornea.\n4|  Adjust head position to focus retina to the fundoscope for examination \n**Note**: Mydriacyl causes temporary lens opacification within 15-20 min after application; it is important to complete examination within this time. \n**Preparation of sections for ocular histology**\n1|  Incubate enucleated eyes overnight in 10% buffered formaldehyde\n2|  Embed eyes and cut 5&#xB5;M paraffin sections in anterior/posterior orientation.\n3|  Stain sections in hematoxylin &amp; eosin \\(H&amp;E). \n4|  Grading of EAU pathology is as previously described. \n**Inhibition of EAU by IL-17 neutralizing antibody**\n1|  Active immunization of C57BL/6 mice with IRBP in CFA \n2|  Dilute IL-17 or IgD2a isotype control antibodies in PBS\n3|  Inject 500 &#xB5;l IL-17 antibody \\(350 &#xB5;g) intraperitoreally into treatment group \\(4 mice) 1 day before immunization with IRBP/CFA emulsion \\(day -1). \n4|  Inject 500 &#xB5;l IgD2a isotype control antibody \\(350 &#xB5;g) intraperitoreally into control group \\(4 mice) 1 day before immunization with IRBP/CFA emulsion \\(day -1).\n5|  Repeat Ab injection every other day until day 17 post-immunization. \n6|  Perform fundscopic examinations at post-immunization days 12, 14 and 16. \n7|  Sacrifice mice at post-immunization day-19 and perform histology\n**IL-27 expression in PBMC or retina is temporally correlated with progression of EAU**\n1|  Immunise mice \\(8) with CFA or IRBP/CFA emulsion\n2|  Monitor EAU progression by fundoscopy and histology\n3|  Sacrifice mice at post-immunization days, 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28",
    "4|  Section 1 eye for histology and stain with H&amp;E \n5|  Isolate RNA and protein extracts from retina, PBMC or lymph nodes\n6|  Analyze IL-27 protein expression by Western blotting\n7|  Analyze IL27 and Ebi3 expression by RT-PCR and qPCR."
