    "Cell isolationCollect 0.2-1.0 g of human WAT from patientsNote: We have utilized this protocol to isolate ASCs from superficial subcutaneous WAT isolated from morbidly obese individuals who underwent either gastrectomy or gastric bypass surgical procedures, as previously described (Leow et al., 2016). However, in unpublished studies from our lab we have also utilized this protocol to successfully isolate ASCs from deep subcutaneous, omental and mesenteric WAT from lean patients who underwent laparoscopic inguinal and ventral hernia surgery.Transfer human WAT biopsy into pre-weighed 50 ml tube with PBS.Note: A maximum of 1 g of WAT should be digested in one 50 ml centrifugation tube.Calculate WAT tissue weight.Note: For the following steps work in a laminar flow tissue culture hood.  Transfer tissue into a 10 cm cell culture dish and mince the tissue into small pieces with sterilized scalpel or scissors. Note: For better tissue digestion, WAT should be minced thoroughly.Transfer the minced tissue into 50 ml tube. Add 3 ml collagenase solution/1 g of tissue. For tissue less than 0.3 g, use 1 ml of collagenase solution. Note: Collagenase solution should be prepared freshly with pre-warmed PBS (from 37 °C water bath).Digest the tissue in 37 °C incubator with shaking (120 rpm) for 1.5 h. Note: No chunks of WAT should be visible after digestion. If chunks of WAT are still visible then digestion time can be extended accordingly. Inactivate collagenase by adding 35 ml of proliferation medium into the 50 ml tube. Immediately centrifuge at 800 x g for 10 min at room temperature.After centrifugation the cell pellet should be visible at the bottom of the 50 ml tube. Carefully aspirate the supernatant (including fat layer) and re-suspend the cell pellet in RBC lysis buffer. For 1 ml of pellet, add 9 ml of RBC lysis buffer (1:9, v:v).",
    "Incubate for 10 min at room temperature.Immediately centrifuge at 800 x g for 10 min at room temperature.Re-suspend the cell pellet in 20 ml proliferation medium by pipetting up and down. Filter the cell suspension through a 100 μm nylon mesh cell strainer into a new 50 ml tube to remove debris.Immediately centrifuge at 800 x g for 10 min at room temperature.Carefully aspirate the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet containing ASCs in 10 ml proliferation medium.Transfer the cell suspension onto a cell culture treated 10 cm plate and incubate at 37 °C/5% CO2 for 24 h.After 24 h cell culturing, non-adherent cells are removed and adherent cells are washed with PBS. Adherent cells (ASCs) are cultured in fresh proliferation medium until 70% confluence.Passage ASCs 1-2 times to expand cell population. A representative image of growing ASCs is shown in Figure 1A. After several days of culture human ASCs show a typical fibroblastic-like morphology (Figure 1A). ASCs can then be either utilized for relevant in vitro investigations or cryopreserved. To cryopreserve ASCs, trypsinize and count 0.5-1 million cells and centrifuge at 800 x g for 10 min at room temperature. Aspirate the supernatant and re-suspend the cell pellet in 1 ml of pre-chilled (4 °C) proliferation medium containing 5% DMSO in cryogenic vials. Store vials in Mr. FrostyTM freezing container filled with isopropanol at -80 °C overnight, before transferring to a liquid nitrogen Dewar for long-term storage. imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161109/20161109005513_9274.jpgFigure 1.

Collect ~0.2 million cells in each 5 ml FACS tube.Immediately centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and aspirate the supernatant.Wash the cell pellet with 3 ml PBS twice. Add 2 ml of ice-cold 4% PFA to each cell pellet and re-suspend the cell pellet by vortexing gently. Incubate at 4 °C for 30 min or keep the fixed cells at 4 °C for subsequent immunofluorescent staining (up to 6 months).Wash the fixed cells with 3 ml of PBS twice.Re-suspend the cell pellet with 1 ml of 15% FBS in PBS and incubate for 20 min for blocking.Immediately centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min and aspirate the supernatant.Re-suspend the cell pellet with 50 μl of primary antibody diluted in ice-cold 15% FBS in PBS (For antibody information please see Table 1).Incubate on ice for 45 min.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161109/20161109010413_7819.jpgFigure 2. Surface marker expression profile analysis of human ASCs by flow cytometry. Isolated human ASCs (from superficial subcutaneous WAT) were analyzed for MSC markers (CD90, CD44, CD29, CD73 and CD105), hematopoietic lineage markers (CD34, CD14, CD11b, and CD45) and endothelial markers (CD31 and CD106) by flow cytometry. Histograms show results of staining of ASCs for indicated surface markers from one representative experiment. Cell counts are indicated on the y-axis and fluorescence intensity on the x-axis. Gate P2 was set according to staining with appropriate isotype-matched antibody controls. The percentages of ASCs stained positively are indicated in each panel.Add 5 ml of ice-cold 0.",
    "5% BSA in PBS. Immediately centrifuge at 200 x g for 5 min at 4 °C and aspirate the supernatant. Re-suspend the cell pellet with 200 μl of ice-cold 0.5% BSA in PBS.Analyze samples using the BD FACSCanto II machine (BD) and FACSDiva software (BD) software for data acquisition.Note: Alternative FACS hardware and software packages can be utilized.Typically we find that more than 98% of the isolated ASCs express MSC markers, including CD90, CD44, CD29, CD73 and CD105. However, less than 1% of the isolated ASCs express cell surface markers for hematopoietic cells (CD34, CD14, CD11b, and CD45) and markers for endothelial cells (CD31 and CD106) (Figure 2).Adipogenic differentiationTrypsinize ASCs and count cell number.Plate cells on cell culture treated 6-well-plates in proliferation medium (see Recipes) at the density of 10,000 cells/cm2.Let cells grow to confluency and wait for another 48 h to arrest cell division.Treat cells with induction medium (Differentiation medium, containing 1 μM dexamethasone [diluted from 10 mM dexamethasone stock solution], 58 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 mM IBMX, and 200 μM indomethacin, see Recipes) for 2 weeks (We have observed that for longer term and more complex experimental studies [Leow et al., 2016], the treatment with induction medium can be decreased to 1 week). Change medium with fresh induction medium every 3 days. Treat cells with insulin medium (Differentiation medium, containing 10 μg/ml insulin, see Recipes). Change medium with fresh insulin medium every 2 days. Cells can be assayed from day-4 to day-7 post treatment with insulin medium. A representative image of differentiated ASC cultures is shown in Figure 1B, clusters of mature adipocytes filled with lipid droplets are visible.To assess lipid accumulation, Oil Red O staining is performed on differentiated mature adipocytes (Ramirez-Zacarias et al., 1992).",
    "For Oil Red O staining, remove medium and wash the cells with 2 ml of PBS/well. Fix the cells with 2 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)/well for 30 min at room temperature before washing the cells with 4 ml of H2O/well. Incubate the cells with 2 ml of 60% isopropanol/well for 5 min. Aspirate the isopropanol and incubate the cells with 2 ml of Oil Red O working solution/well for 30 min at room temperature. Aspirate Oil Red O working solution and wash the cells with H2O before taking images. Representative images of Oil Red O stained mature adipocytes are shown in Figures 1C (4x objective) and 1D (20x objective). Oil Red O stained lipid droplets are clearly visible."
