    "Thymus withdrawal Mouse euthanasia was performed through 100% CO2 inhalation at a flow rate of 20 L/min in accordance with National and European laws for laboratory animal welfare (EEC Council Directive 2010/63/UE) and the Marseille Ethical Committee for Animal experimentation no. 14. Verify that the mouse is unresponsive to a toe pinch.Place the mouse on its back and pin each limp down to the dissection board. Spray with 70% ethanol to sterilize the mouse body.Open the thoracic cavity with scissors and carefully expose the heart and thymus above without cutting major blood vessels.Gently remove the thymus with a pair of forceps.Note: Make sure to remove fat and connective tissue from the thymus. Transfer the thymus into a 15 mL collection tube pre-filled with 2 mL of enzymatic digestion buffer for WT mice or 2 mL of cold FACS buffer for OTIIxRag2-/- mice.Thymic epithelial cell isolation Digest the thymus from WT mice in a water bath at 37 °C for 15 min in 2 mL of digestion buffer; then, dissociate the tissue by approximately 20 recurrent aspirations through a 1,000 μL tip.Note: Agitate the fractions gently during the digestion process and avoid bubbles. Filter thymic cells through a 70 μm pore cell strainer into a 50 mL tube with 3 mL of cold FACS buffer.Collect remnant undigested tissue from the cell strainer with forceps and return it to the 15 mL tube containing digestion buffer.Digest remnant tissue in a water bath at 37 °C for 15 min. Then, dissociate the tissue by approximately 20 recurrent aspirations through a 1,000 μL tip.Filter thymic cells through a 70 μm pore cell strainer into the 50 mL tube with 3 mL of cold FACS buffer.Repeat steps B3–B5 until complete tissue digestion.Centrifuge at 450× g for 5 min at 4 °C.",
