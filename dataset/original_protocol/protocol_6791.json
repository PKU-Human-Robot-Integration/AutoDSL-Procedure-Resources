  "procedures": [
    "Collect 2-3 fecal pellets (approximately 50 mg) from each mouse into a tube.Note: Feces can be stored at -80 °C until measurement. Add 0.5 ml of ice-cold mucolytic enzyme buffer (Recipe 1) into the tube containing fecal pellets and gently vortex.Note: Vertexing is not necessary if feces are not solid. Sonicate samples using ultrasonic processor for 5 s with 35% amplitude and 3 mm tapered microtip on ice. Repeat ultrasonication following a 10 s interval for a total of 9 cycles or 45 s.Centrifuge sonicated samples at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C.Transfer ~400 μl supernatant into fresh 1.5 ml tubes and measure protein concentration.Note: Supernatant can be stored at -80 °C, until measurement. Adjust the protein concentration to 1 mg/ml by adding ice-cold mucolytic enzyme buffer.Transfer 5 μl (5 μg protein) supernatant of a particular fecal sample into three wells (5 μl each) of a 96-well flat-bottom plate. Add 150 μl of a specific 10 mM nitrophenyl-based substrate (Recipe 2) prepared in ice-cold mucolytic enzyme buffer. For each enzyme tested, corresponding substrate is added into triplicate wells containing the same sample. These procedures are repeated when multiple samples are used.Measure the absorbance at 405 nm in a plate reader at 37 °C at every 30 min interval.Using a known concentration of 4-nitrophenol standard curve (Recipe 3), determine the individual mucolytic enzyme activity (Figure 1).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e3956/bioprotoc-11-06-3956-g001.jpgFigure 1. Time-dependent mucolytic enzymatic activity in mouse fecal samples. Fecal samples collected from healthy mouse were homogenized and processed as described in the protocol. The activity of indicated enzymes was measured in the fecal lysate following the procedure described in the protocol."
