Typically, a well-dispersed 1H-15N HSQC spectrum with cross peaks displaying uniform intensity is a good start.\nCritical: Please consult the local NMR facility and confirm NMR parameters such as pulse width and power level are up to date. For protein backbone assignments, other triple resonance experiments can also be used depending on the size and property of the target protein.\nAdjust the receiver gain using “rga” command in the topspin terminal.\nUse the “zg” command for individual experiment or “multizg” command to run all above experiments.\nNote: Please consult the local NMR facility to set up the triple resonance experiments using non-uniform sampling (NUS) methods, which can reduce data acquisition time to 25%. With NUS, the data acquisition times for the HNCACB, CBCA(co)NH, and HNCA experiments used in this protocol were 13 h (64 scans), 5 h (32 scans), and 4 h (16 scans), respectively.",
    "Note: Prior or during data acquisition, the sample stability should be monitored by running N15-HSQCs every day (or experiment). If the overlay of the HSQC spectra shows extra peaks in the ∼8 ppm [H]/∼126 ppm [N] region, the protein sample is undergoing degradation or denaturing.

Change to c-shell using “csh” command (default shell is bash shell on Linux OS).",
    "Enter the “fid.com” command in the 3D-NMR folder (i.e., HNCACB, CBCACONH, HNCA).\nUse steps 38–44 to process all 3D-NMR data.\nBackbone NMR assignments using CCPNmr\nTiming: 5–7 days\nPeak picking and backbone chemical shift assignment.\nConvert the nmr data from pipe format into sparky using the below command or use pipe-format files (xxxx.pipe) in CCPN assign module.\npipe2ucsf xxxxxx.ft2 xxxx.ucsf.\nOpen CCPNmr Analysis Assign from terminal using “assign” command.\nSelect all ucsf or pipe files from the NMR data folder and drag them into the sidebar or load the spectrums using “ls” command and opens a tab to navigate the folder that contains the NMR data files.\nDrag and drop the 15N-HSQC, CBCAcoNH, HNCACB & HNCA spectra anywhere on the purple box in the drop box area. Spectra with the same frequencies can be shown in the same module, which allows to toggle and overlay between multiple spectra in on/off display mode.\nRight-click on each spectrum and click on contours or use the command CO, then uncheck the negative contours except for HNCACB spectra. Adjust the contour levels to minimize the noise levels for all spectra.\nClick on the 15N-HSQC spectrum and use Ctrl (or Cmd for Mac) + Shift + Left-drag on the contour to create the blue box in the region. Release the button and keys to select the peaks or perform auto peak picking using shortcut PP. Define spectral regions for N & H to select the positive peaks in 15N-HSQC spectra.

To pick peaks in the 3D spectra based on the 15N-HSQC spectrum, use the Pick & Assign module, and use the restricted peak picking tab to pick the peaks. Noise peaks should be removed while using the restricted peak picking tab and then select the following option in the tab NmrChain: NC:@-.\nAlternative to PA shortcut: go to Main Menu ⟶ Assign ⟶ Pick and Assign.\nCritical: Accurate peak picking is critical for backbone chemical shift assignment protocol, particularly when using automatic programs. Noise, artifacts and peak overlap strongly affect subsequence steps and should be inspected carefully.\nTo define the atom nomenclature in the 3D spectrum, Select the NMR atom assigner. Using peak and assign tab or short cut PA, select the peak with index 0 and select the contour using NA tab to define the CA(i), CA(i-1) and CA(i), CA(i-1), CB(i), CB(i-1) and CB(i), CB(i-1) in the HNCA, HNCACB, and CBCAcoNH spectrum respectively.

    "Note: Many other NMR software and online server such as SPARKY (Lee et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]) and PINE (Lee et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]) are also frequently used for analyzing NMR spectra, peak picking, and chemical shift assignment. Alternative to CCPNmr, PINE-SPARKY extension (Lee et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]) also supports interactive assignments.\nUse the Spin Graph assigner to inspect the sequential connection in the given sequence and continue the assignments until all sequential assignments of residues are completed.\nOpen the Assignment Inspector module to check the connectivity of all residues in the given protein sequence.\nMain Menu ⟶ Assign ⟶ Assignment Inspector or shortcut AI.\nNote: Video tutorials and manual for using CcpNmr Analysis V3 can be found at https://ccpn.ac.uk/manual/v3/index.html[href=https://ccpn.ac.uk/manual/v3/index.html].\nChemical shift perturbations (CSPs) calculation and histogram plotting\nTiming: 1 day\nCalculate CSPs in NMR titration experiments (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]) and plot as a histogram. Ligands that specifically bind to the target protein typically induce significant but un-uniform CSPs on multiple crosspeaks, whereas the rest of crosspeaks were little perturbed. Alterations in the solvent environment due to the addition of ligands, such as pH or crowding effect, typically induce uniform changes in all perturbed crosspeaks. In addition, CSPs induced by specific ligands will become saturated as the ligand concentration increases.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2148-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Assignments of amide resonances and analysis of the arginine amide titration experiment\nSuperimposed 1H,15N HSQC spectra of p62ZZ(115-190) collected while arginine amide was titrated in. Assignment of backbone amides were shown.\nInput the processed NMR spectra of apo-formed p62ZZ and p62ZZ bound to dusquetide peptide, arginine amide and free arginine at different molar ratios into the CCPNmr or Sparky software.\nAdjust the counter level of the spectra to get an appropriate signal to noise ratio for further peak picking process.",
    "Perform the automatic peak picking. Inspect all the selected peaks and manually pick the missed ones and delete those that were picked out incorrectly.\nLabel the peaks with the assigned residues on the spectrum of arginine-bound p62ZZ based on the previous assignments.\nCopy the assignments to the spectrum of apo-p62ZZ and adjust peak positions by tracing arginine-induced movement of crosspeaks.\nCritical: Assigning apo-p62ZZ based on the assignment obtained using arginine bound form is highly accurate in this case as the affinity of ZZ/Arg interaction is estimated to be in the millimolar range. All amide crosspeaks in p62ZZ are in the fast-exchange regime and were confidently mapped.\nLabel the peaks with the assigned residues on the spectrum of apo-formed p62ZZ based on the mapped assignments.\nCopy the assignments to the spectrum of p62ZZ bound to dusquetide peptide or arginine amide at a molar ratio of 1:4 and adjust peak positions based on titration experiments.\nOutput the peak lists containing the 1H and 15N coordinates of individual peaks on the spectra.\nCopy the coordinates of the peaks in apo form and substrate-bound p62ZZ NMR spectra to a Microsoft Excel table.\nCalculate the observed CSPs in p62ZZ bound to substrates at a protein/ligand ratio of 1:4 relative to free state using the following formula:   1 / 2    δ H 2  +    α ⋅  δ N     2     , where δH and δN are the chemical shift changes in ppm for the 1H and 15N dimension respectively, and the values are the differences of the corresponding coordinates of individual peaks between apo-formed and substrate-bound p62ZZ. The coefficient α equals 0.2.\nNote: Calculation of CSPs can be performed automatically and raw histogram can be generated in the software. For record keeping purpose, this protocol exports the peaklists and performed the analysis in Microsoft Excel.",
    "Plot the histogram using the residue numbers and the CSPs in Excel. The p62ZZ domain comprised of amino acid 115–190 are included in the plotting except for the proline residues that are not visible in HSQC spectrum. The missing prolines are indicated by filled dots.\nTreat the CSP value as zero for unassigned residues and indicates them with filled squares. CSPs for amino acids 174–190 of p62ZZ are less than 0.01 ppm and not shown.\nMark the threshold with a dash line. Residues with the CSPs above the threshold are considered to be significantly perturbed and involved in the interaction with ligands.\nNote: The threshold is empirically based on each experiment. There is no standard rule to define significantly perturbed crosspeaks across different protein-ligand pairs. In general, a value at one or two times the standard deviation can be used as an initial threshold.\nMapping the perturbed residues onto p62ZZ surface\nTiming: 1 h\nMap the CSPs onto known target protein structure.\nOpen the PDB file of p62ZZ in complex with dusquetide peptide in Pymol software (DeLano, 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]).\nDisplay the background in white color.\nPresent the p62ZZ protein as surface in white and the dusquetide peptide as sticks in pink. Set the surface quality value to 2.\nSelect the most perturbed residues with CSPs above the threshold in the histogram and show these residues as surface in pink.\nLabel the surface-exposed residues on the surface of p62ZZ.\nOutput the graph for figure making."
