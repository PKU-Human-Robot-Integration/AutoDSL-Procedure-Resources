    "Liposome preparationLipids should be kept stored in a glass container in chloroform at -20 °C until required for use. Only prepare liposomes as required and use prepared liposomes within 24 h. Use a glass Hamilton syringe to transfer the required amount of phosphatidylinositol (PI) (10 mg/ml) in chloroform to a clean (methanol washed and dried) glass tube (Pyrex 12 x 75 mm). As 10 µg of extruded liposomes are used per reaction, it will require 1 µl per reaction to be carried out. It is advised to prepare slightly more liposomes than required as some volume is lost during the extrusion process (see step 1e). It is advisable to work with a minimum of 20 µl of chloroform (10 mg/ml) lipids; it is also advised to carry out each reaction in duplicate or triplicate (see Note 1 for further information).Evaporate the chloroform under a stream of nitrogen gas. Use a steady flow rate that is sufficient to disturb and push the lipid up against the side of the tube as it dries, this reduces the chances of residual chloroform becoming trapped under dried lipid. A subtle dried opaque coating should be visible on the tube.Dry the lipid further for 1 h in a speedvac with suitable attachment for the Pyrex tubes. Traces of chloroform can be detrimental to the assay, so it is important that all chloroform is evaporated.Re-suspend the PI in assay buffer (to give a 1 mg/ml solution) and allow 30 min to re-suspend with periodic vortexing and by using a sonicating water bath. The mixture should look chalky/cloudy.",
    "Prepare the lipid mini-extruder by assembling with a 100 nm pore filter, assay buffer (~1 ml) can be used to flush through the extruder and ensure the system is assembled correctly without leakage and this will minimise any loss of volume. Detailed assembly instructions can be found via the Avanti website (http://avantilipids.com/divisions/equipment/mini-extruder-assembly-instructions/[href=http://avantilipids.com/divisions/equipment/mini-extruder-assembly-instructions/]). Collect the lipid solution in one glass Hamilton syringe and attach to the extruder system. Pass slowly through without excessive pressure from one side to the other (~10 times) until the solution becomes clear (as seen on Avanti website: http://avantilipids.com/divisions/equipment/mini-extruder-extrusion-technique/[href=http://avantilipids.com/divisions/equipment/mini-extruder-extrusion-technique/]), indicating that liposomes (Large unilamellar vesicles - LUVs) have been formed and are now in solution. Always ensure that the lipid mixture is at the opposite side to where it began so that everything has passed through the filter.The liposomes are now prepared and ready for use in the in vitro assay.In vitro phosphorylation of PIThis assay is suitable for use with either recombinant (Bago et al., 2014) or immunoprecipitated VPS34 (Munson et al., 2015), although in the latter case it is important to ensure the antibody utilised does not interfere with activity. Follow a standard immunoprecipitation protocol to isolate VPS34 directly or co-immunoprecipitate it by targeting a binding partner (e.g., BECLIN1, ATG14L, UVRAG). As this assay involves the use of radioactive 32P-γ-ATP, ensure that all work is carried out in an area where radioactivity is allowed and meets local regulations and requirements for its use. When carrying out this assay, it is important to include appropriate controls such as a negative bead only/no kinase control, a positive kinase control [this could be recombinant protein of Class I or Class III PI3K as both will form PI(3)P in vitro from PI].",
    "A PI3K inhibitor (such as Wortmannin or VPS34-IN1) can also be used to verify that PI(3)P formation is being observed (as these should block formation).Suspend either recombinant protein or beads if immunoprecipitating in a final volume of 40 μl assay buffer inside Eppendorf tubes. Dilute the extruded liposome mix within the 40 µl volume to a total amount of 10 μg of extruded liposomes per reaction. Add 10 μl of the 5x ATP mix as a final addition to each sample and place directly into a thermomixer at 30 °C/1,100 rpm for 30 min. It is ideal to stagger the addition of ATP mix to each sample to allow time to process each sample at the end of the 30 min reaction. This time will vary dependent if the assay is being carried out on beads from an immunoprecipitation or with recombinant protein. It is advised to become familiar with the following steps and have a trial run to determine the optimal staggering time. Terminate the reaction by the addition of 500 μl Stop solution. If using beads, then first separate the beads by passing through a Spin-X column before addition of Stop solution to the eluate. Sample buffer (1x) can be added to the beads retained in the column and re-eluted into a fresh tube. These samples can then be used for western blot to verify and determine the levels of immunoprecipitated protein between samples and serve as a control for the assay.Once all samples are in Stop solution, the components are phase-split by the addition of 180 μl chloroform and subsequently 300 μl 0.1 M HCl per sample. Vortex samples gently before centrifugation at 0.5 x g/1 min. The samples will split into an upper aqueous (water-methanol) and lower organic (chloroform-methanol) lipid-containing layer.",
    "Prime a pipette tip by briefly pipetting chloroform up and down. Once primed, put the pipette tip through the methanol layer to aspirate the lower chloroform layer and remove to a separate tube. Expel the pipette whilst moving to collect the lower layer to minimise carry over. Dry chloroform samples in a speedvac (~5-10 min). Once dry, samples can either be retained at -20 °C to run at a later date or used immediately for separation of lipid products by TLC. Thin layer chromatography (TLC)Lipid products can be separated by spotting and running on a Silica 60 TLC plate. A simple overview of the TLC process is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20160811/20160811012110_2870.jpgFigure 1. Overview of TLC procedure. Samples are spotted onto the origin (a point above the TLC solvent) and added to the TLC chamber containing solvent. As the solvent travels up the plate, the phosphorylated lipid products are separated. In this case, the lipid product PI(3)P cannot but seen by eye, but will be detected by the incorporation of 32P.Pre-treat the TLC plate by wetting completely in potassium oxalate solution to improve the resolution of phospholipids (Gonzalez-Sastre and Folch-Pi, 1968). Allow to dry fully, this can be left at RT overnight (~16 h) or can be dried more rapidly using a hairdryer. The TLC chamber should also be prepared in advance by addition of the TLC solvent to saturate the chamber. Whatman paper can be added at the sides of the chamber to improve speed and maintain even resolution when running the TLC plates.Mark gently in pencil where each sample is to be loaded at least 2 cm from the bottom of the TLC plate. The loaded samples must not be lower than the solvent level in the tank.",
    "Dried samples should be resuspended in 50-100 μl of chloroform and spotted onto the TLC plate. A glass narrow-bore capillary can be utilised for spotting samples onto the TLC plate. The sample should be applied gradually, allowing the chloroform to dry before adding further. Application speed can be improved by utilising a hairdryer to evaporate the chloroform quickly between spotting.Once completely loaded, the TLC plate should be placed into the TLC chamber and left until the solvent front reaches just below the top of the plate. The plate should then be removed and allowed to dry in the fume hood. The level of phosphorylation can then be determined by multiple means. The incorporation of 32P correlates to phosphorylated lipid and can be measured by exposure to x-ray film. Other methods that have a greater linear range of detection such as a Phosphorimager can be utilised if available for more accurate quantitation. Assay of recombinant VPS34/VPS15 is very clean and produces a single band that migrates up the plate. Signal observed at the origin that does not migrate is likely to be carryover 32P-γ-ATP that has not been incorporated into a lipid product. In the case of an immunoprecipitation, the retained sample buffer from step 2c can be analysed by western blot for VPS34 levels. This can then serve as a loading control to normalise the values obtained via the TLC plate."
