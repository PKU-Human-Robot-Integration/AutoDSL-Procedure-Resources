    "All protocols were performed in accordance with the guidelines in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health and Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Duquesne University.\n1. Preparation and Anesthesia\nNOTE: Aseptic techniques are used for the entirety of the procedure. Only new sterile materials and autoclaved sterile instruments are to be used. Personal protective equipment (sterile gloves, hair bonnet, surgical mask, scrubs) needs to be worn to avoid contamination.\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250–300 g were used in this protocol. Acclimate the rats to standard living conditions, keep them on a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle, and provide food and water ad libitum. House the animal socially, keep them on paper bedding, and provide a special diet (see Table of Materials) to avoid autofluorescence during imaging.\nWith the use of a properly placed heating pad, anesthetize the animal under an initial 5% isoflurane in 20% oxygen, followed by a maintenance level of not less than 1.5% isoflurane and not more than 3%, unless the animal wakes up or retains feeling.\nConfirm proper anesthesia via a lack of response to tail pinches. Monitor the blood flow as well via vital signs throughout the procedure.\n2. Pre-injection Image Aquisition\nImage the animal in a preclinical NIR fluorescence imager by positioning the animal laterally to expose the injection site on the lateral tail to establish a baseline of fluorescence in the tail (Figure 1C,E). Perform a simultaneous image acquisition of both a white light (body view) and near infrared channels using the NIRF imager and associated software, with linked lookup tables (LUT).\nFollowing imaging, move the animal back to the surgical table, and place it under anesthesia for the tail vein injection.",
    "NOTE: Continue monitoring the animal’s vital signs and recheck proper anesthetization via tail pinch.\n3. Tail Vein Injection with NIRF-containing Agent\nWith the animal in the prone position, orient the tail with the dorsal side facing up. Dilate the tail vasculature in warm water for a minimum of 1 min. Orient the tail vein so the lateral side (either right or left) is turned 30° (clockwise or counterclockwise) to expose the right or left tail vein (Figure 1B).\nOnce a lateral tail vein has been located (which appears dark-colored upon dilation), disinfect the entire tail with alcohol pads, repeating 2x.\nAt an appropriate dosage based on the study design, begin injections in the distal coccygeal vertebrae region of the tail and moving more proximal if proper needle placement fails.\nInsert a 25–27 G sterile needle, bevel up, into the lateral tail vein, with the tail at a 180° angle, inserting the needle parallel to the lifted tail. Observe blood flashback in the rim of the needle to ensure correct placement. If no flashback is apparent, slowly move the needle tip (without removing it from the tail) to find vein insertion. If placed subcutaneously, no blood flashback will occur.\nInsert the syringe with the injectable materials into the rim of the needle. When proper placement is achieved, the injectable fluid will not incur resistance upon injection. The injection will advance smoothly and easily. Once injected, remove the needle and the syringe, apply pressure with sterile gauze for at least 1 min to ensure clotting, and mark the spot of injection with a pen on the tail, ensuring it is visible on the white light image.\nNOTE: No hematoma or lesion will be visible at the site of injection.",
    "If the needle tip moves during the syringe insertion, remove the needle and retry the needle entry procedure more proximal on the ipsilateral tail vein. Do not reuse the same needle if a different reentry point is tried.\nNOTE: Alternatively, the injection can be performed with an IV catheter with a blood-flow indicator (see Table of Materials). This has the benefit of visual confirmation of the catheter during venipuncture. Insert the catheter, bevel side up, at the angle previously described. Observe prompt flashback in the entire length of the blood-flow indicator to ensure correct placement. Slight back pressure can be used to pull blood into the syringe to confirm proper placement in the vessel before injecting. Again, no resistance will be felt.\n4. Post-injection Image Acquisition\nPerform quality assessment following tail vein injection in a preclinical NIR fluorescence imager in the same orientation as the baseline pre-injection image. Ensure the animal is still properly anesthetized — and will be so for the duration of imaging — prior to placing it in the imager.\nNOTE: An imaging system containing a drawer housingwith anesthesia connections and a mask for the animal should be used if available.  \nOrient the animal on its lateral side to expose the injection site (as marked) on the lateral tail. Check to see if a NIRF signal is present only at the site of injection. This indicates a successful tail vein injection (Figure 1D).\nNOTE: If the signal is dispersed throughout the entire tail, it is considered to be subcutaneous and, hence unsuccessful (Figure 1F). Figure 2 shows additional examples of failed injections.\n5. Image Quantification\nNOTE: Image quantification can be performed with the imaging software that accompanies the NIR imager, if this function is available. Alternatively, other commercially available image analysis software may be used24.",
    "In the post-injection image, draw a region-of-interest around the area of fluorescence at the injection site2,6. \nMeasure the area and relative fluorescence intensity and record as area/intensity. Compare post-injection and baseline pre-injection images either qualitatively or quantitively by using appropriate statistical analysis(dependent on study groups and conditions).\nNOTE: The researcher can decide on thresholds that discriminate good from bad injections or assign a percentage of quality to the injection."
