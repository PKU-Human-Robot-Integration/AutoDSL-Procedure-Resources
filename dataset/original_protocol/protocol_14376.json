  "procedures": [
    "In all procedures, BALB/c adult male and female mice who express gfp under the promoter of Cx3cr1 were used24. Mice were treated according to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and all procedures were approved from the Swiss government according to the Federal Swiss Regulations on Animal Welfare. Mice were anesthetized by a subcutaneous injection of medetomidine hydrochloride (0.75 mg/kg) and ketamine (45 mg/kg). Proper anesthesia was confirmed by monitoring the respiratory rate and the animal's reflex against a tail pinch. At the end of the experiments, mice were euthanized with CO2 inhalation.\nNOTE: Perform each imaging session as quickly as possible (maximum 20 min), since cataract formation following anesthesia may hamper retinal visualization30.\n1. System Configuration\nTurn on the computer.\nTurn on the power supply. The message \"Start acquisition module\" will appear on the device`s control panel screen.\nDouble click on the software`s desktop shortcut to operate the software.\nOn the database view, click the \"add patient\" icon.\nIn the pop-up window, insert all necessary information (last name, first name, title, date of birth, sex, and patient-ID) and click \"ok\". On the pop window set the corneal curvature to 2 mm and click \"ok\".\nPosition a 78D standard ophthalmic non-contact slit lamp lens in front of the standard 30 ° optic and fasten it safely with tape.\nMake sure that the filter lever on the left of the device is positioned on the indication \"A\" to allow both IR+OCT and AF imaging (Figure 1).\n2. Mouse Preparation",
    "Use a medetomidine hydrochloride dose of 0.75 mg/kg and a ketamine dose of 45 mg/kg in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) to prepare anesthesia solution. Thus, for a 20 g mouse, mix 15 µL of medetomidine hydrochloride with 18 µL of ketamine to a final volume of 50 µL in PBS. Store the solution at 4 °C for up to one week.\nGrasp the mouse by the scruff and apply one drop of tropicamide 0.5% + phenylephrine hydrochloride 2.5% on each eye to achieve pupil dilation.\nKeep the mouse restrained, and with an insulin syringe attached to a 30G needle, inject 50 µL of the anesthesia solution subcutaneously. Put the mouse back in its cage that is placed above a heating pad. Wait 3-5 min until the mouse is fully sedated. To assess anesthetic depth, pinch the tail of the mouse. Check the corneal reflex by gently touching the mouse cornea with a cotton swab. If no positive reflex is observed, continue with the imaging.\n\tNOTE: It is important to monitor respiratory rate during anesthesia. If the mouse is not fully sedated, the respiratory rate will increase upon a painful stimulus.\nHydrate the mouse cornea with an application of 2% hydroxypropylmethylcellulose drops on each eye.\n3. SD-OCT\nPlace a warming patch of approximately 32 °C on the custom-made platform attached on the device`s chin rest (Figure 1).\nTo image the right eye, place the mouse on the left part of the platform (Figure 1). Ensure that the right orbit of the mouse faces the lens and its body lies prone on the left part of the platform.",
    "Apply a drop of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose on the right eye and carefully position a +4 diopter rigid gas permeable contact lens on it (spherical power: -25.00 to +25.00 diopters). Store the contact lens in balanced salt solution (BSS). To grab the lens, use plastic or silicon forceps to avoid damage.\nPress the yellow box on the right corner of the control panel display to start the acquisition module (green box on Figure 2A). The yellow box will turn green and the control panel menu will appear on the screen (Figure 2A).\nFor acquisition of B-scans, select the option IR+OCT on the control panel (Figure 2A). Selected settings are highlighted in blue on the control panel.\nSelect \"Retina\" under \"Application and Structure\" in the software and move the lens towards the mouse eye using the micromanipulator on the device (Figure 1). Before focusing onto the retina, check that the indication \"OD\" is selected on the left bottom part of the screen. The software automatically identifies the left (OS) and the right (OD) eye based on the position of the objective.\n\tNOTE: If the objective is positioned on the middle of the platform, an error message will appear on the bottom of the screen. In that case, re-position the mouse slightly until the software recognizes the correct eye.\nWith the focus knob, focus on the retina until the big vessels are clearly seen in the fundus image on the left of the computer screen. Move the camera by turning the micromanipulator left or right, to move the camera in that direction, or clockwise or counterclockwise, to move the camera up or down, respectively.\n\tNOTE: Reposition the mouse on the platform or move the lens upwards or downwards to achieve the preferred localization of the optic nerve head in the infrared image.",
    "Turn the sensitivity knob counterclockwise to reduce or clockwise to increase the brightness of the fundus image. When optimal focus is achieved, an SD-OCT B-scan will appear on the right of the screen.\n\tNOTE: If the B-scan cannot be visualized by adjusting the focus, press the combination Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O on the keyboard. In the pop-up window, adjust the value of the reference arm until the B-scan appears on the screen.\nOn the bottom right of the screen, choose the single scan from the pattern menu (single line in Figure 2B).\nTurn the micromanipulator of the device (Figure 1) left, right, forward, or backward (to turn the camera in that direction) to ensure that the B-scan is located between the top and bottom corners of the SD-OCT scan window.\nSet the Automatic Real-Time (ART) value to at least 9 to obtain high quality images.\n\tNOTE: ART improves image quality by averaging several consecutive scans. The higher the \"ART\" value, the higher the signal-to-noise ratio and thus the image quality. However, by increasing the \"ART\" value, the acquiring time is also increased.\nPress the \"acquire\" button (Figure 2) on the control panel screen and acquire the images.\nRe-position the mouse to image the left eye and repeat steps 3.2-3.12.\nRemove the contact lens with plastic/silicon forceps and place it into BSS.\nHydrate the mouse cornea with a fresh drop of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and remove the excess with a tissue paper.\nRemove the standard 30 ° optic by rotating it counterclockwise.\nMount the 55 ° lens and repeat steps 3.4-3.12 for each eye.\n4. Auto Fluorescence Imaging\nWithout moving the mouse on the platform, select IR on the control panel.\nWith the focus knob, focus on the big retinal vessels.\nOn the control panel select AF.",
    "Turn the sensitivity knob counterclockwise to reduce or clockwise to increase the brightness of the image.\nPress the sensitivity knob and set the \"ART\" value to 67 or more to obtain high quality images.\nWhen the set \"ART\" value has been reached, press \"acquire\" on the control panel to acquire the image. Press the sensitivity knob again to stop averaging. Adjust the focus, to visualize different retinal layers.\nRemove the 55°  lens and mount the wide field 102°  lens. Follow steps 4.1–4.6 for both eyes of each mouse and for every mouse.\nClick “Save images” on the left upper border of the window and then click “exit”. To save the images in the computer, select the mouse from the list on the right part of the screen by double clicking on the mouse name. Double click on each image separately and then click on the floppy disc icon. Save the image as .tif, .bmp, .jpg, or .png at the desired folder. To exit the software press “File” and “Exit”.\n5. Anesthesia Reversal\nHydrate the mouse eyes with one drop of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and return the mouse on a heating pad.\nPrepare atipamezole solution in a dose of 2.25 mg/kg to reverse the sedative effects of medetomidine hydrochloride. For a 20 g mouse, add 9 µL of atipamezol in a final volume of 150 µL PBS. Store the solution at 4 °C for up to one week.\nmin after anesthesia injection (step 2.2), inject 150 µL of atipamezole solution subcutaneously.",
    "Monitor the mouse until recovery from anesthesia. When the mouse is fully recovered (5-10 min after atipamezole injection) put it back in its cage. Recovery is indicated by the ability of the animal to turn its body when laid on one side, regaining of walking activity, and reacting in response to environmental stimulation.\n6. Manual Retinal Thickness Measurement from SD-OCT Images\nOpen the OCT scan by double clicking on the name of the animal.\nOpen the B-scan obtained with the 30 ° or 55 ° lens.\nChoose \"thickness profile\".\nPress the \"Edit Layer Segmentations\" icon (Figure 2B). The software automatically identifies the inner limiting and base membrane.\nIf necessary, manually correct the position of the inner limiting and base membrane. To do so, choose the layer to be modified from the left side of the screen and then the red circle option (Figure 2B). Move the circle with the mouse button pressed to modify the line.\nModify the line to position the corresponding layer correctly. Click \"Save and close\" to exit the window.\n\tNOTE: Due to reflectivity of the choroid, the software may identify the base membrane incorrectly. Thus, it is preferable to define it manually before proceeding to retinal thickness measurements.\nChoose \"Retina\" under the \"Layer\" option. A diagram of retinal thickness will appear on the bottom of the screen.\nClick on a different position either on the diagram or on the B-scan to view the retinal thickness (indicated in µm) for the selected position.\nMeasure the retinal thickness in the desired distance from the optic nerve head and copy the values in a spreadsheet.\nRepeat steps 5.1-5.9 for each mouse for both the 30 ° and the 55 ° lens.\nPerform statistical analysis with desired software.\nSubscription Required.
