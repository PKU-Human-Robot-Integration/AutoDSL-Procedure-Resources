    "ETHICS STATEMENT: Experiments involving animal subjects were performed in accordance with the guidelines and regulations set forth by Landesamt fuer Gesundheit und Soziales, Berlin, Germany (G0298/13) and the ARRIVE criteria, as applicable. For this study, 10- to 12-week-old male C57Bl/6J mice were used.\n1. Lateral Chronic Cranial Window Preparation\nPerform anesthesia with a subcutaneous injection of ketamine (90 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg). Test for adequate sedation with a pain stimulus.\nSterilize the surgical instruments and surgical field with 70% ethanol.\nRemove the scalp hair from the neck to the eyes using a rodent shaver.\nFix the head in a stereotactic frame.\nUse dexpanthenol eye ointment on both eyes to avoid dehydration.\nClean the surgical area to remove all hairs and sterilize it with 3 layers of 74.1% ethanol and 10% 2-propanolol.\nPerform a midline incision from the neck to the eyes using a scalpel.\nSpan the skin flap with 4 tenting sutures.\nRemove the periosteum carefully on the left hemisphere by scraping it off with a scalpel to the point where the temporal muscle begins.\n\tNOTE: This preparation also serves to create a good adhesion area for the dental glue, which fixes the cover glass.\nPerform a fronto-parietal craniotomy with a diameter of 4 mm by thinning the skull at the rim of the bone flap using a microdrill. Apply saline solution while drilling to avoid heat injury.\nElevate the bone flap with cannulas and remove it using microforceps.\nIrrigate carefully and extensively with saline solution.\nMix the dental glue until it has the proper consistency and is not fluid (i.e., the glue should not produce threads anymore). Place it on the bone around the craniotomy.",
    "Place a cover glass with a 6-mm diameter on the prepared glue and fix it with the rest of the dental glue. Be sure that it is watertight. Wait until the glue is dried and hard by testing it with forceps.\n\tNOTE: An additional irrigation accelerates the curing process.\nRemove the tenting sutures and close the wound with skin sutures.\nPull up the skin of the flank of the mouse. Insert a needle subcutaneously and gently substitute 0.5 ml of sterile saline subcutaneously for fluid balance.\nAfter surgery, keep the animals in the heated recovery cage for 90 min. Wait until the animals are fully awake before leaving them unattended. Wait until the animals are completely recovered before returning them to a cage with other animals.\nRepeat the subcutaneous saline volume substitution after about 12 hr, as described in step 1.16.\nAlways apply analgesia via gavage or directly into the oral cavity after surgery (e.g., paracetamol (10 mg/ml) or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).\nCheck the condition of the animals every day after surgery, and always provide mashed animal food on the floor in a petri-dish to make eating simple and to avoid critical weight loss after surgery.\n\tNOTE: Intravital microscopy can be performed on the first day after cranial window preparation.\n Apply isoflurane anesthesia and fix the animal in a head holder. Open the skin suture and clean the window with cotton buds and sterile saline. After 24 hr, the cranial window should be filled with cerebrospinal fluid by that time point, which enables imaging. Perform imaging by using established microscopy protocols18.\n2. Distal MCAo\nNOTE: The MCAo procedure should be performed about 5 d after CW preparation. This minimizes interference from the immune reaction caused by the CW preparation with the stroke-induced immune reaction.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/54701/54701fig1.jpg",

A feedback controlled heating pad, heated according to the rectal temperature of the mouse, is highly recommended.\nPlace the animal in the lateral position. Fix the nose in the anesthesia mask and adjust the isoflurane concentration to 1.0 - 1.5%.\nApply wet ointment (dexpanthenol) to both eyes.\nUse the skin incision made for the CW preparation.\nGently separate the skin and identify the temporal muscle underneath.\nAdjust the energy of the high-frequency generator (5 - 7 W) and use the bipolar mode.\nUse the electrocoagulation forceps and carefully remove the temporal muscle from the skull, creating a muscle flap, without totally removing the muscle.\nIdentify the MCA below the transparent skull in the rostral part of the temporal area, dorsal to the retro-orbital sinus. If the MCA bifurcation cannot be identified, try to identify the vessel most rostral.\nThin the skull above the MCA branch with a microdrill while continuously irrigating to avoid heat damage.",
    "Lift the bone with cannulas and remove it with microforceps.\nDecrease the energy of the high-frequency generator to 3 - 5 W.\nApproach the artery from above and gently touch it with the bipolar forceps on both sides without lifting the vessel.\nCoagulate the artery proximally and distally to the vessel bifurcation.\nWait for 30 sec, and then touch the artery gently to ensure that the blood flow is permanently interrupted. Repeat the electrocoagulation if a recanalization is observed.\nFix the temporal muscle with 1 or 2 stitches at the muscle insertion to cover the bone defect, if possible.\nSuture the wound and place the animal into the heated recovery box. In general, animals recovery quickly after volatile anesthesia.\nFor volume substitution, apply 0.5 ml of sterile saline subcutaneously, as described in step 1.16.\nAfter surgery, allow the animals to stay in the heated recovery cage for 90 min. Wait until the animals are conscious before leaving them unattended. Only return them to a cage with other animals when they are fully recovered.\nRepeat the volume substitution, as explained in step 1.16, after 12 hr.\nApply postoperative analgesia via drinking water (e.g., paracetamol (10 mg/ml) or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).\nCheck the medical condition of the animals every day after surgery. Provide mashed animal food in a petri-dish on the floor to simplify eating and to minimize postoperative weight loss.\n3. Sham Treatment\nPerform all procedures identically to steps 1 and 2, described above-including CW preparation-except do not coagulate the exposed middle cerebral artery.\nSubscription Required.
