  "procedures": [
    "Mice were housed and cared at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) Division of Animal Care following the National Institutes of Health (NIH) guidelines and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, US Department of Health and Human Services. All animal procedures were approved by the VUMC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee prior to starting the experiments.\n1. Animal preparation and dissection\nTurn on the germinator and water pump of the heating pad about 30 min before starting surgery.\nCut 0.5 mm length polyurethane tubing with a sharp scalpel. Remove 0.2 mm of the circumference by making a cut lengthwise to make a cuff.\n\tNOTE: This is a critical part of the renal artery stenosis procedure that requires extreme precision, attention to details and patience. Try to cut several pieces of polyurethane tubing at a time. Perform all of this procedure under microscope.\nBefore proceeding any further, put on surgical sterile gloves and a surgical mask.\nUse C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) mice of 6-8 weeks. Use an equal number of male and female mice to avoid any sex bias.\nRecord the weight of the mice before performing surgery. The ideal weight to perform renal artery stenosis with polyurethane tube is 18-22 g. Handle mice gently and do not agitate while injecting the anesthesia. Administer pre-operative analgesia (Ketofgen, 5 mg/kg body wieght).\n\tNOTE: While transferring the mice from their housing room to the surgery room, carry them with great gentleness and care to avoid agitation. Carrying mice cages in hands instead of a trolley is highly recommended.\nAnesthetize the mice with a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg BW) and xylazine (10 mg/kg BW) via intraperitoneal (I.P.) injections.",
    "Place the mouse back inside the cage until fully anesthetized. It takes about 4-5 minutes before the mouse is fully unconscious. Pinch the tail or toe with forceps to check if the mouse is fully unconscious and ready for the surgery.\nLay the mouse on its back on a paper towel. Remove the hair of the lateral abdomen using an electric hair clipper following the opposite direction of hair growth. After shaving the surgical site, clean the area with a surgical scrub containing iodine (or chlorhexidine) followed by a rinse with 70% ethanol (or sterile saline).  Repeat 3 times.\n\tNOTE: The hair removal procedure must be performed at some distance or preferably at a different bench than the surgery procedure bench to avoid any hair interference and hair contamination during the surgery procedure.\nCover the heating pad with a sterile sheet. Bring the mouse to the surgical bench and place on to the sterile sheet, facing the mouse’s right lateral side towards the microscope. Maintain a constant pad temperature of 37 °C with circulating water.\nOpen the sterilized bag containing all the surgical equipment. Using a dissecting microscope and sterile sharps scissors, make a small flank incision (close to 13th thoracic rib, the last rib in mouse) and about 0.5 cm away from vertebrae. Proceed along the lumbar vertebrae and make a 1 inch incision.\nPull back the skin and muscle to expose the kidney.\nClean and remove the surrounding fat using sterile cotton swabs to isolate the renal artery. Isolate the renal nerve from the renal artery using curved forceps.\nWhen performing the sham surgery, apply sutures to close the skin and apply antibiotic to the closed wound, then proceed to Post-operative care. If not, proceed with the following section to stenose the artery.",
    "NOTE: Every experiment should have sham animals as controls of the surgical procedure. Sham animals consist of mice that have gone through the surgical procedure of exposing the renal artery without placing a cuff on it.\n2. Right renal artery stenosis\nPlace two nylon sutures under the right renal artery, make loose knots, and then place the cuff around the main renal artery approximately equidistant between the kidney and aorta bifurcation\nClose the cuff using the nylon sutures. Make four knots for each suture to avoid the probability of losing the sutures after the surgery.\nClose the incision in the muscle by applying a simple continuous suture.\nMake simple interrupted sutures to close the skin.\nAdminister IACUC approved analgesics.\n\tNOTE: Autoclave surgical tools before every use. If more than one surgery is being performed at once, wipe all used tools with a sterile alcohol gauge and place them in hot germinator for 15-30 s after every surgery. Change sterile gloves also for each mouse.\n3. Post-operative care\nReturn mice to their cage and leave the cage half on, half off, a circulating water heating pad for 2 - 3 hours. Add gel diet recovery food inside the cage.\nAdminister painkiller (ketoprofen) intraperitoneally (dose: 5 mg/kg BW) the next day.\nWeigh the mice for the next two days; if some mice lose more than 20% of their weight consult with the veterinarian and decide if the animal needs to be euthanized following the appropriate IACUC authorized procedure.\nMonitor the mice daily to assess for redness, swelling, pain or infection.\nSeek veterinary consultation for postoperative complications in accordance with the institutional IACUC policies..\n4. Tissue harvest\nHarvest tissue 3 weeks after surgical procedure. Record the weight of each mouse.\nEuthanize the mouse with an IACUC approved procedure.",
    "Place the mouse on a sterile platform in supine position to dissect.\nSecure and extend the limbs to limit movement.\nThoroughly spray the mice with 70% ethanol.\nMake a midline incision to open the abdomen and chest area using sharp scissors.\nPull back the skin and peritoneal wall.\nCarefully expose the heart and puncture the right ventricle and exsanguinate the mouse.\nRemove both kidneys using forceps. Kidneys are located on the back of the mice.\n\tNOTE: Do not mix both kidneys. Be aware of stenosed, sham, and contralateral kidneys.\nRemove the kidney capsule, clean them from any fat and record the weight of each kidney separately.\nCut a longitudinal section of both kidneys and fixed in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C to be later processed for paraffin embedding, to perform in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Follow ISH and IHC protocols as reported23,24.\nIsolate the cortex of the remaining kidney and flash freeze in liquid nitrogen to perform western blot. Store samples at -80 °C until analysis.\nQuantify renin, and N-GAL expressions with Western blot as described in literature23,24.\n5. Statistics\nUse one-way or two-way ANOVA for experiments with three or more conditions followed by Bonferroni post-hoc tests for comparisons between individual groups. Consider a p-value equal or less than 0.05 significant. Use software (e.g., GraphPad Prism 8.2) to perform all statistical analysis.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
