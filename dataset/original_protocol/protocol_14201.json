See Figure 5.\n2. Risk Stratification Tables\nNote: The risk stratification service provides an automatic computation of the CV risk factor based upon various risk stratification tables that are recommended in the guidelines of the European Society of Hypertension/European Society of Cardiology (ESH/ESC)22. For each of the tables, the CV risk factor is computed and recorded based upon various parameters that are uploaded in the patient profile throughout the steps of the checkup data input. The higher or lower importance of each of the tables in the analysis is provided by the specialist while ensuring that each designed stratification table pays special attention to the specific conditions of the patient.\nClick on the Find patient link and insert the patient code or click on the List patients link and select the patient code for a patient with existing registered checkups.\nFrom the list of checkups, click on the Revise checkup link to access the checkup report and go to the block of risk stratification tables.",
    "Click on the ESH/ESC table link to access the table page. Check the highlighted cell to get the qualitative level of cardiovascular risk. Check the recommendations and possible antihypertensive treatment related to the resulting risk. Click on the Go back link to access the general checkup report.\n\tNote: This decision table uses the SBP and DBP measurements together with several risk factors and diseases (age, abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, metabolic syndrome, etc.) to provide the CV risk factor as well as recommendations or treatment23.\nClick on the MS table link to access the Metabolic Syndrome (MS) table page. Check the presence of MS on the basis of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criterion. Check the presence of MS on the basis of the International Diabetes Fund (IDF) 2005 criterion. Click on the Go back link to access the general checkup report.\n\tNote: This table uses the information related to abdominal obesity, triglyceridemia, c-HDL, BP and fasting glucose24. ATP III criterion indicates the presence of MS if 3 of the above measures are outside the tolerance levels. According to IDF 2005 criterion, MS is determined by the presence of abdominal obesity together with 2 of the other measures outside the tolerance levels.\nClick on the Score table link to access the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) table page. Check the highlighted cell to obtain the 10-year risk of fatal cardiovascular events. Check the color of the highlighted cell in the legend to obtain the qualitative level related to the risk. Click on the Go back link to access the general checkup report.\n\tNote: This table uses information related to age, gender, SBP, smoking, and cholesterol25.",
    "Click on the Framingham table link to access the table page. Check the highlighted cell in the last table to obtain the 10-year risk of suffering a coronary event (angina, heart attack, with or without symptoms, fatal or not). Click on the Go back link to access the general checkup report.\n\tNote: This table uses information related to the parameters of age, gender, smoking, diabetes, cholesterol, cholesterol HDL, and BP26. The highlighted cells indicate the contribution of each category to the final risk.\n3. ABPM Analysis\nNote: ABPM is a common test that allows the monitoring of the patientâs blood pressure throughout their daytime/nocturnal routine9. The device selected for recording ABPM measurements (see the Table of Materials) is among the few BP monitors that are officially validated by international organizations such as the British Hypertension Society (BHS) or the ESH.\nPut the BP monitor on the patient and check that it is operating properly by taking an initial manual measurement. Instruct the patient on how to obtain the measurements manually before going to sleep and on waking up in order to delimit the day and night recordings.\nAfter the recording period, remove the BP monitor from the patient and retrieve the ABPM file. Upload the ABMP file to the block of ABPM measurements of an existing or a new checkup related to the patient (step 1.4.13).\n\tNote: The monitor remains connected throughout a period of time (usually 24h or 48h) and the measurements are regularly recorded at predefined intervals (typically 15 or 30 minutes).\nPerform ABPM analysis.\n\t\nClick on the Find patient link and insert the patient code, or click on the List patients link and select the patient code of a patient with any registered checkup containing ABPM data.",
    "Click on the Revise checkup link to access the checkup report and go to the block of ABPM analysis.\nClick on the ABPM link to access the ABPM information display.\nCheck the rate of valid records in the general information section to ensure that the results extracted from the ABPM file are reliable.\nCheck the information regarding the period of time during which the patient wore the monitor such as the number of hours and quality of sleep, the time of going to sleep and waking up, etc.\nCheck the ABPM map including the graphical representation of all the recordings, such as the SBP, DBP and pulse as well as the areas under or over the maximum normal levels for each measurement.\nClick on the buttons for 48h, 24h (i) or 24h (ii) to change the visualization mode for the 48 h ABPM files.\nClick on the means button to switch the visualization mode to an even representation of the measurements.\n\t\tNote: This visualization mode computes each point from the average among consecutive measurements in the raw data.\nCheck the additional information extracted from the original data such as the means and standard deviations of SBP, DBP, pulse rate and pulse pressure (the difference between SBP and DBP).\nCheck the parameters regarding BP evolution that were automatically computed by the tool: nocturnal BP drop, sleep thought, pre-waking morning surge and day/night quotient for SBP and DBP measures.\nCheck the summary table that contains the automatically computed areas under or over the maximum clinically defined thresholds for the nocturnal and diurnal measurements of SBP, DBP, and pulse pressure.",
    "Note: Furthermore, the ABPM service also calculates the circadian profile from the relation between the daytime and nocturnal BPÂ²Â³. This profile allows cardiovascular risks to be determined by analyzing the presence of BP deviations. The smart report (step 4.4) and the ABPM report (step 4.5) contain the information related to the circadian profile.\n4. Clinical Reports\nNote: The report service provides a set of reports that gather all the relevant information to support the clinical decision-making process, helping physicians in their clinical practice and promoting collaboration among experts.\nClick on the Find patient link and insert the patient code, or click on the List patients link and select the code of a patient with any registered checkup.\nClick on the Revise checkup link to access the full checkup report which contains all the data recorded during the checkup registration process grouped into the various categories.\nClick on the ABPM link to access the data extracted from the ABPM analysis.
