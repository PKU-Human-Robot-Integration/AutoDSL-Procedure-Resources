Collect the cells in a 15 mL tube.\nCentrifuge the tubes at 3,000 RPM (1741 × g) for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nWash the cell pellet with ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1× complete Protease inhibitor and 2 mM DTT. Centrifuge the tubes at 3,000 RPM (1741 × g) for 5 min at 4°C. Discard the supernatant.\nPrepare lysis buffer by supplementing polysome lysis buffer (PLB) with 2 mM DTT, 1× complete protease inhibitor, 200 units/mL RNaseOUT out and 200 units/mL SUPERase IN.\nAdd 5-pellet volumes of freshly prepared lysis buffer to the pellets (for instance, 500 μL of lysis buffer to cell pellet volume of 100 μL) and gently resuspend the pellets by pipetting up and down for a few times.\nLeave the tubes on ice for 10 min, then place them at −80°C overnight to complete the lysis. Samples can be stored at −80°C until use.\nRNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)",
    "Timing: 4 days\nProtein-RNA complexes are precipitated using the specific antibody against the protein-of-interest, and RNA is extracted from the precipitated protein-RNA complexes with trizol-chloroform extraction method. RNA extraction is best done using the Trizol-chloroform extraction method, rather than column extraction method. The amount of RNA obtained from immunoprecipitation may be too low for efficient recovery from extraction columns since a certain amount of RNA can be lost in the columns. Extracted RNA is then purified using Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl Alcohol.\nBead preparation.\nAliquot 50 μL of beads for each RIP [anti-FLAG M2 beads for RIP of FLAG-tagged IGF2BP1 or Protein A/G Dynabeads® for RIP of endogenous IGF2BP1] to protein low binding tubes (Eppendorf, Cat#0030108132).\nPlace the tubes on a magnetic stand for 30 s. Remove the solution.\nWash beads 3 times with ice-cold PBS.\nAdd 500 μL of ice-cold PBS to each tube.\nRemove the tubes from the magnetic stand.\nResuspend the beads in ice-cold PBS by gently inverting the tubes. Centrifuge the tubes briefly with Bench top centrifuge to collect residual beads from the cap.\nReplace the tubes on the magnetic stand for 30 s until the solution becomes clear.\nRemove the supernatant.\nRepeat steps (3ci – v) 2 times.\nNote: For RIP of FLAG-IGF2BP1 using anti-FLAG affinity beads, proceed to step 4.

This blocking step will reduce non-specific interactions.\nLysate preparation and protein concentration measurement can be done while blocking the beads.",
