  "procedures": [
    "NOTE: All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with approved Stanford, Palo Alto VA HCS, and National Institutes of Health Institutional AnimalCare and Use Committee guidelines.\n1. Preparing for Sample Collection and Processing (Time Required: ~10-15 min)\nInoculate murine B16F0 melanoma cells (0.5-1 x 106) subcutaneously at or near the midline of the abdomen in female C57BL/6 mice as described previously6. Alternatively, inoculate tumor cells at additional anatomical sites (e.g. flank, mammary fat pad, etc).\n\tNOTE: Any number of tumors (implanted or spontaneous) can be used and evaluated using this protocol. For example, other commonly used syngeneic tumors in C57BL/6 include the colon line MC38, Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC), and the prostate TRAMP-C2 line. While human xenografts inoculated into immunodeficient mice can also be evaluated in this way, it should be noted that the profiles of the tumor-infiltrating leukocytes will necessarily be altered in accordance with the immunodeficient state of the host mouse.\n\t\nUse complete media (e.g. RPMI containing 10% FBS and additives) or another appropriate protein-containing buffer (e.g. HBSS or PBS +1% FBS or 1% BCS). Chill media or buffer to 4 °C prior to euthanization.\nSet up collection tubes and filters for resected tumors; place these on ice.\n\t\nUse one 50 ml conical tube per tumor to be resected. Insert a 40-70 µm cell suspension filter in each one. Alternatively, use 15 ml conical tubes with metal filter mesh. Use a 5 ml syringe plunger or thick pen to create a cup-shaped filter at the top of the 15 ml tube.",
    "Prepare instruments for resection and tumor processing; use surgical forceps and fine scissors to resect and process tumors. Use 70% ethanol to clean instruments between resections/tumor samples. For larger number of samples (e.g. >10), we recommend simultaneous processing of samples by multiple researchers to avoid significant differences in processing time between tumor samples.\n2. Tumor Resection (Time Required: ~5 min/tumor)\nEuthanize B16 tumor-bearing mice individually using carbon dioxide or other approved method.\nSecure the mouse on a surgical stage. Spray the tumor area with 70% ethanol and wipe excess off; this helps prevent spreading of any hair present. For non-nude mice, shave the skin area around the tumor prior to resection as needed.\nUsing forceps and scissors, resect the subcutaneous tumor en bloc, including overlying and surrounding skin. The amount of “margin” skin taken can be varied, but typically resect 2-3 mm of skin around the tumor.\n\t\nWeigh resected tumors (+/- surrounding skin) at this point. Place the resected skin/tumor section in the filter secured within the plastic conical tube.\n3. Preparing a Single Cell Tumor Suspension (Time Required: ~5-7 min/tumor)\nUse forceps and scissors to mince tumor and overlying/surrounding skin. Mince the sample using scissors until all large sections of tissue are processed into 1-2 mm sections.\n\tNOTE: Typically, whole tumors are processed; alternatively, for larger tumors, representative sections of tumors could be minced and processed.\nUsing a plunger from a disposable 5 or 10 ml syringe, mechanically disaggregate the minced tumor tissue against the secured filter.\nUsing a pipettor, wash the processed tumor tissue with 5-10 mls of cold media or buffer. This will flush the single cells through the filter.\nRepeat the above two steps several times, ensuring that the total number and volumes of washings are approximately the same for similarly sized tumors.",
    "After washing the processed tumor tissue, observe small fragments of skin and/or other connective tissue should be left behind in the filter.\nAlternatively, for tumors where mechanical disaggregation alone may not be sufficient, digestion with collagenase and/or other enzymes can be performed prior to the mincing procedure. This will allow for a more thorough single cell suspension. However, it should be noted that such digestion protocols can affect surface antigen expression20, so caution should be taken in interpreting these results.\nWash and pellet the cells by adding media/buffer and centrifuging at 4 °C 500 x g for 5 min.\n4. FACS Staining of Single Cell Suspension (Time Required: ~30-60 min)\nResuspend cells in ice cold FACS buffer (PBS + 1% FBS).\nCount viable cells using trypan blue and a hemacytometer, or automated cell counter.\nDetermine total viable cell yield per volume. This data can be used to extrapolate absolute numbers of tumor infiltrating leukocytes in combination with FACS data.\nDetermine the number of cells to be stained and analyzed by FACS. This will be influenced by several factors (e.g. tumor histology type, tumor age and size, average percentage of infiltrating leukocytes, etc.).\n\tNOTE: In B16 melanoma, we found a low percentage of tumor infiltrating leukocytes (TIL; typically <5%) compared to tumor cells. Thus, at least 1 x 106 total tumor (tumor + infiltrating leukocytes) cells were typically collected via FACS for analysis.\n\t\nUsing the trypan-stained counting data, calculated volume of cells to be stained for FACS. For example, if TIL typically constitute 5% of total tumor cells (many of the tumor cells will be dead on trypan stain), factor this into the total number of tumor single cell suspension to be stained.",
    "For less common leukocyte subsets e.g. CCR9+ pDC) use a larger number of total tumor cells (e.g. 2-3 x 106) for FACS staining, given the relative low frequency of these cells in the single cell suspension.\nStain the tumor single cell suspension for FACS.\n\t\nFor live/dead discrimination, use a fixable stain or non-fixable stain (e.g. propidium iodide) can be used. If cell are stained without live/dead discrimination, caution must be advised given the potential for non-specific binding of antibodies.\nStain the cell suspension for specific leukocyte subsets using a standard FACS staining protocol. Block cells to reduce non-specific antibody binding with PBS/FBS containing 1% rat serum and Fc block (anti-CD16/32) for 10 min prior to staining with antigen-specific antibodies. Include the correct isotype control antibodies to ensure staining is specific.\nAt this point, after the FACS staining is complete, fix samples with 4% formaldehyde or other similar fixative agent. Store samples at 4 °C in the dark (as to avoid quenching of fluorophores) until time of collection and analysis.\n\t\tNOTE: Storing fixed samples for long periods of time may result in alteration in signal and intensity of the fluorophores21.\nCollect the samples on a flow cytometer. Optimal flow cytometer settings will vary depending on type of instrument and laser/detector setup.\n\t\tNOTE: Additionally, there can be variability between experiments even if using the same machine. Thus, perform appropriate machine setup (e.g. using calibration beads) to ensure appropriate compensation setting prior to FACS collection and analysis of each experiment.\nAnalysis of leukoctye subsets\n\t\nUsing FACS data analysis software, to analyze the data. For a live/dead stain, start by gating out dead cells. Use antibody against a leukocyte specific marker (e.g. anti-CD45) to identify leukocytes within the live cells.",
    "After this, use various gating schemes to identify specific subsets, depending on the staining protocol. For example, to identify CD4+ T cells, select the SSClo region from the CD45+ population and select the CD19-CD3+ cells; from this CD4+ T cells can be identified22.\nAnalyze data and present it in a number of different ways to ensure consistency and identify patterns or trends (i.e. use total numbers, percentages, or ratios to quantify subsets).\n\t\tNOTE: For example, we looked at total live CD45+ cells as a percentage of total tumor cells collected (Figure 1). Additionally, we then calculated the percentage of each leukocyte subset (eg CD4+ T cells) within the tumor and compared these as ratios between the control and test groups (Figure 3).\nSubscription Required.
