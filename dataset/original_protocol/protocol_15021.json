    "This animal protocol was approved by and is in accordance with the guidelines and regulations set forth by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at The Ohio State University. All policies developed by the local IACUC are in compliance with the Animal Experimentation Guide developed by Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare at the National Institutes of Health.\n1. Anesthesia and Endotracheal Intubation\nAutoclave all instruments and surgical supplies before use. Wear sterile, single use surgical gloves throughout the procedure. Maintain a sterile field throughout the procedure. Use of a sterile drape is suggested but not shown in the video to allow for better visualization of anatomical landmarks on the mouse.\nPlace each mouse individually in an induction chamber and provide anesthesia using 5% isoflurane and oxygen with a flow rate of 0.4 L/min until loss of righting reflex and then maintain the animal with 2% isoflurane in 100% oxygen with a flow of 0.4 L/min by means of a nosecone tube connected to the anesthesia apparatus until the tracheal tube is in place. The isoflurane anesthesia machine used should be appropriately vented and equipped with charcoal filters to minimize exposure of the surgeon to isoflurane fumes during the procedure. The nosecone is noted but not shown in the video to allow for visualization of the manipulations to intubate the mouse.\nShave the animal’s chest with an animal hair clipper in a different location than the surgery platform to avoid contamination of the surgery location.",
    "Place the mouse in a supine position on surgery platform for subsequent intubation. A simple small polystyrene foam platform can serve as an operating platform. Cover the platform with a pre-sterilized drape to provide a sterile surface. Place a heating pad between the platform and drape to maintain the body temperature of the mice in surgical procedures.\nAttach a length of 2–0 silk suture of at least 10 cm to the platform with tape and then loop the suture around the front upper incisors. Position the cone in close proximity (2-3 cm) to the edge of the platform over the nose of the mouse. Pull the mouse taut and secure it to the platform by the tail with a piece of tape.\nSecure the legs to the sides of the body with strands of tape. It is important that the front limbs are not over-stretched as this can compromise respiration.\nPrepare the shaved surgical sites with Betadine and alcohol before the neck and chest incisions are made.\nPlace the platform with the mouse head pointing in the direction of the operator. Cut a 0.5 cm median cervical skin incision. Separate the lobes of the thyroid gland at their isthmus to expose the sternohyoideus muscle where the trachea can be seen under the muscle.\nRemove the inner needle of an 18 gauge trocar so it can be used as an intubation tube. The needle point can serve as a holder and 1 cm of the outer tube can serve as the tracheal tube.\nHold the tongue of the mouse with curved forceps in one hand and move it slightly upwards. View the trachea through the cervical skin incision. Use the other hand to gently insert the intubation tube until the tube is seen inside the trachea.",
    "As soon as the tube is in the tracheal, move the curved forceps in other hand towards the tube and quickly remove the inner needle. If the tube cannot be inserted into the tracheal, the tube should be pulled out to avoid producing respiratory problems. It is important to point the tip of the tube up when it is close to the throat in order to avoid inserting the tube into the esophagus instead of the trachea.\n2. Ventilation and Fixation\nProvide artificial ventilation with an animal respirator venting 2% isoflurane in oxygen with a flow rate of 0.4 L/min. Use a modified Y-shape connector to connect the intubation tube with the ventilator. The correct positioning of the tracheal tube can be confirmed by judging the symmetrical chest expansion.\nSet the tidal volume at 260 μl/stroke and ventilation rate is 130 strokes per minute, which can be adjusted to the body weight of a particular mouse if necessary.\nRemove the tape on the tail and turn the mouse gently to place it in a right lateral decubitus position for the subsequent surgery. Use tape to secure the tail and legs to the platform again.\nInsert the rectal probe to monitor the body temperature and adjust the warming pad to maintain the temperature around 37 ºC.\nSecure the probe to the platform using tape. Inject bupivacaine subcutaneously at the incision site to numb the area before the incision is made.\n3. Thoracotomy",
    "Make an oblique incision that is approximately 1 cm long at a site 2 mm away from the left sternal border in the direction of where the left front leg meets the body (approximately 1-2 mm below where the leg and body join). The superficial thoracic vein is near this site and the incision should be made so that the lateral end of the incision goes up to, but does not cut into, the vein.\nCut though the thoracic muscle to expose the ribs underneath. During this step avoid accidental injury of the vessel. If bleeding does occur, use cotton applicators to stop any bleeding before proceeding to the next step7.\nVisualize the ribs and inflating lung through the thin and semitransparent chest wall. Open the chest cavity using surgical scissors to make a 6-8 mm incision in the third intercostal space. This incision should be a minimum of 2 mm from the sternal border where the internal thoracic artery is located. Damage to the artery will produce heavy bleeding that is difficult to control.\nInsert the pre-sterilized homemade chest retractors into the incision and gently pull back to open the incision so that it is about 8-10 mm wide while being careful to avoid the lung. The retractors should be attached to the surgical platform with pins. \nAt this point the heart should be visible, however, the lung will still cover a portion of the heart. Pick up the pericardium gently with curved forceps, pull it apart, and slide the tissue behind the retractors. During this manipulation the lung will lift up and away from the heart.\n4. Positioning LAD",
    "Locate the LAD on the surface of the heart through a dissection microscope. The LAD runs down the middle of the heart wall from near the apex of the heart down through the left ventricle. The LAD appears bright red and will be pulsing strongly. The vein here is sometimes mistaken for the LAD, however proper lighting can help distinguish the two vessels. If the lighting is too bright it can be difficult to appreciate the color differences between the vessels.\nUse a sterile cotton ball fragment with a diameter of approximately 1-2 mm to prepare the LAD for ligation. Place the cotton between the left atrium and left ventricular, which will lift the left atrium and help expose the LAD and clarify its position. If the LAD cannot be located, the fragment can be slid further in so the left atrium is lifted even higher to reveal the aorta where the LAD originates.\n5. LAD Ligation\nThe ideal positioning for the ligature is approximately 2 mm lower than the tip of the left auricle. The pulmonary trunk can be used as a marker to help identify the left auricle. Alternatively, the ligation position can be visualized as a point 1-2 mm away from the branching of the left circumflex. Use curved forceps to gently apply pressure at a site immediately below the intended ligation point. This will make it easier to see the artery and will also help hold the heart in place and simplify tying the ligature. Do not apply pressure with the forceps for more than 5 seconds at a time and avoid compression of the heart that might alter pumping.",
    "Use a tapered needle to pass a 6–0 silk suture underneath the LAD while observing with a dissecting microscope. Insert the needle under the artery with precision as the needle will enter the left ventricle chamber if placed too deeply or damage the LAD if the needle is too shallow. If the LAD is injured remove the needle and suture the LAD to control bleeding, however if bleeding cannot be controlled it is preferable to euthanize the animal.\nMake a loose double knot with the suture, leaving a 2-3 mm diameter loop through which a 2-3 mm long piece of PE-10 tubing is placed8.\nTighten the loop around the artery and tubing then secure the loop by tying one additional slipknot, taking care not to damage the ventricle wall. For permanent ligation, directly tie the LAD with a knot9. Confirm the occlusion of LAD by checking for appearance of a paler color in the anterior wall of the LV that should appear within a few seconds after ligation.\nRemove the retractor and close the wound temporarily by pinching the skin together with a bulldog clamp. The length of time that ischemia is maintained depends on the experiment design, but is frequently 20, 30, 45 or 60 min. The mouse remains on the ventilator for the duration of the LAD artery occlusion.\n6. Reperfusion\nAfter the ischemia period remove the bulldog clip and insert the chest retractors to expose the ligature. Untie the knot and remove the PE-10 tubing. Confirm reperfusion by observing a return of the pink-red color of the anterior wall of the LV after 15-20 sec.\nLeave the suture in place if 2% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) and blue staining will be performed after reperfusion. If staining is not necessary, the suture can be removed.",
    "The reperfusion time will depend on the experiment design, usually spanning from 1 hr to 24 hr.\n7. Chest Closure and Postoperative Care\nClose the chest cavity by sewing shut the incision in the 3rd intercostal space with 4–0 silk suture. It is important that the lungs are clear of the suture and do not become trapped as the 3rd and 4th ribs are sutured together. While tying the suture knots it is helpful to apply slight pressure to the chest with the needle holder to minimize any room air that might be trapped in the chest cavity.\nClose all layers of muscle with continuous sutures using 4–0 silk. Use nylon sutures to close the skin with a continuous suture. Alternatively, the skin can be closed with interrupted suture.\nWhen suturing is complete cease the flow of isoflurane while oxygen continues to flow. Once the mouse moves its whiskers or tail it, should start making attempts to breathe spontaneously. Remove the mouse from the ventilator with the intubation tube still kept in the trachea.\nObserve the animal carefully until the mouse resumes a normal breathing pattern and then extubate the mouse. The tube should be removed slowly to avoid aspiration of oral cavity secretions.\nConfirm the mouse is not in any respiratory distress by observing it for another 3-5 min before returning it to a cage. If signs of dehydration are observed after surgery, provide up to 0.5 ml of sterile saline by intraperitoneal injection.",
    "For post-operative analgesia, administer an opioid analgesic (buprenorphine, 0.1 mg/kg) subcutaneously (SC) before the animal is ambulatory and then provide an additional dose every 4-6 hr for the next 24 hr. Check the animal signs of distress at 12 hr after surgery. Simulation of myocardial infarct using survival surgery requires assessment of pain and distress following recovery from the surgery. The current accepted best practice is to provide analgesia for the first 24 hr following an invasive procedure with additional doses given as warranted due to weight loss or signs of pain. For permanent ligation, body weight should be tracked daily to help to gauge the animal’s recovery.\nIbuprofen (Motrin), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesia and antipyretic activity, or other NSAIDs, may be provided in the animal's drinking water as a 0.2 mg/ml solution for two days before the surgery and up to a 7 days after surgery in along with the buprenorphine  to manage any additional pain/distress.\n8. Measurement of Myocardial Infarct Size\nAnesthetize and intubate the mouse at the end of desired reperfusion time. Cut the chest skin in the midline to the xyphoid. Open the abdomen and the diaphragm below the rib cage and from both sides of the midclavicular line.\nExpose the heart and then re-ligate the LAD in the same location. Cannulate the aorta so 10% Phthalo Blue can be slowly injected directly into the aorta to stain the heart for delineation of the ischemic zone from the nonischemic zone10.",
    "Rapidly excise the heart and wash it in 30 mM KCl (potassium chloride solution) to cease the beating of the heart and allow for more consistent sectioning. Freeze the heart for at least 4 hr at -20 °C and cut the heart into slices of 1 mm using a heart matrix sectioning device11.\nIncubate heart slices with 2% TTC at 37 °C for 40 min. The infarct area is demarcated as a white area while viable tissue stains red.\nFix the stained slices with 10% formaldehyde overnight, which will help to increase the contrast between the infarct area and the normal tissue. Photograph the slices and calculate the area at risk (AAR), the nonischemic zone and the infarct area using ImageJ software.\n9. Measurement of Cardiac Enzyme Levels\nMeasure cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels in the serum of mice by obtaining blood from the portal vein and then isolating serum by centrifugation. Serum cTnI levels are then determined with a quantitative rapid cTnI assay12.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
