    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nThis protocol describes all steps of organoid culture from purified primitive neural progenitor cells (pNPCs) 2D culture to fused forebrain organoids (Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]). Our protocol relies on the fusion of dorsal and ventral forebrain organoids, which provides opportunities to examine the differentiation, migration, and maturation of oligodendrocytes in the organoids. To avoid non-CNS tissue and reduce variability among individual organoid generation, we used pNPCs as the starting cell population to generate forebrain organoids. pNPCs were derived from either hPSCs or hiPSCs between passages (P) 20 and 45 using a small molecule-based protocol (Chen et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Li et al., 2011[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]). The harvested pNPCs were stored in liquid nitrogen for long-term storage, and cells were used no more than P5.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/572-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Timeline for the fused organoids formation\nA schematic procedure for deriving region-specific forebrain organoids from pNPCs by stage-specific medium changes. The stages after week 0 are color-coded based on the expression of GFP:OLIG2.\nThawing pNPCs (week –1)\nTiming: ∼ 30 min\nThis step provides a detailed procedure for thawing pNPCs.\nPrepare the pNPC medium before starting this step\nWarm pNPC medium in 37°C water bath (∼ 20 min) beforehand.\nMove Matrigel-coated 6-well plates from the incubator and place them in the hood.\nRemove cryovial of pNPCs from liquid nitrogen and thaw 1–2 min in 37°C water bath.\nTransfer contents of the cryovial to 15 mL tube, and then add 5 mL of pNPC medium dropwise to cells.\nSpin at 500G for 4 min, aspirate supernatant, and resuspend the cell pellet in 2 mL pNPCs medium.\nAspirate Matrigel from one well of a 6-well plate and add the 2 mL pNPC suspension to the well.",
    "Culture these pNPCs with every two days of media change until you have sufficient numbers to have the desired cell density of 3∗106 pNPCs per well. Cell number of the full confluence of pNPCs in one 6-well plate will be around 1∗107.\nNote: At week 0, we recommend immunostaining with an antibody specific of PAX6 (GeneTex, 1:400) to verify the human neuroectodermal cell fate (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for the antibody).\nOrganoid formation from two-dimensional pNPC culture (week 0)\nTiming: 2 days\nThis step provides a detailed procedure for producing uniform organoids from the two-dimensional culture of pNPCs (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/572-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2.

Scale bars, 100 μm.\n(B) Organoids formed from pNPCs at day 3; scale bar, 200 μm.\nPrepare the NPC medium before starting this step\nAspirate pNPC medium and wash the well with 2 mL of PBS, then aspirate the PBS.\nPipet 2 mL of TrypLE into each well of pNPC.\nPlace the plate in the incubator for 4 min.\nTap the plate and see if the pNPC colonies have completely detached from the wells.\nNeutralize TrypLE with 2 mL of DMEM/F12 medium. Move the contents into 15 mL conical tubes.\nCentrifuge the cells for 4 min at 500 g.\nAspirate supernatant from the 15 mL conical tube.\nAfter cell number calculation, place the cells into the low-attachment 96-well round-bottom plate at a density of 9,000 cells to develop uniform organoids with 250 μl of pNPC medium.\nCentrifuge the plate for 4 min at 500 g.\nReturn cells to the incubator and do not disturb the plate for 48 h.",
    "Two days later, transfer six aggregates per well of a 6-well plate with widened pipette tips to minimize mechanical stress and damage.\nPlace the plate on the orbital shaker in the incubator, set, and keep at 85 rpm.\nRegional patterning of forebrain organoids (week 0–2)\nTiming: 2 weeks\nThis step provides a detailed procedure for patterning and developing the spheroids to generate ventral or dorsal forebrain organoids (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). After spheroids' passaging into the low attachment well, start the long-term culturing on an orbital shaker.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/572-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

Student’s t test: ∗p < 0.05 and ∗∗∗p < 0.001.\nFor the two weeks of patterning culture, the medium will be changed completely every day. In this process, the medium will be the NPC-based medium supplemented with either 5 μM Cyclopamine A (CycA) for dorsalization or sonic hedgehog (SHH; 50 ng/mL) and purmorphamine (Pur; 1 μM) for ventralization.\nPrepare the ventralization and dorsalization media before starting this step\nWorking volume: 2.0 mL per well of 6-well plate\nDo not culture more than five organoids in each well of a 6-well plate.",
    "Culture on an orbital shaker at 85 RPM.\nMedium change: every day\nGently swirl plates so that spheroids will collect into the center of the well.\nSet aside a sterile 1.5 mL centrifuge tube for each well. Collect spheroids with a P1000 pipette. Cut the tip using a sterile scissor to create a wider opening to minimize mechanical stress.\nAspirate the medium remaining in the wells and then add 2.0 mL of each patterning medium to the wells. Note that excessive medium can cause unintended organoid fusion during agitated culture.\nWait till the spheroids sink in the bottom of the Eppendorf tube; remove the supernatant medium with a P1000 pipette without affecting the spheroids.\nGently pipet 500 μL fresh medium supplemented with either CycA for dorsalization or SHH/Pur for ventralization from the well and gently add it to the Eppendorf tube to suspend spheroids.\nWhile free-floating, collect and transfer the spheroids back into their respective well. Repeat this if organoids remain in the Eppendorf tube.\nPlace the plate on the orbital shaker in the incubator, set, and keep at 85 rpm.\nNote: At week 2, we recommend immunostaining with an antibody specific for NKX2.1 (Abcam, 1:200) to verify the ventral forebrain regional identity. Alternatively, qPCR with primers for NKX2.2, DLX1, and LHX6 can confirm the ventral identity. Whereas dorsal forebrain regional identity can be confirmed by an antibody specific for PAX6 (GeneTex, 1:400) and primers for EMX1 and TBR2 at week 2 (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for antibodies and primers)\nOligodendroglial and neuronal differentiation in organoids (week 2–4)\nTiming: 2 weeks",
    "This step provides a detailed procedure for oligodendrogenesis and neuronal differentiation in the patterned forebrain organoids. After two weeks of patterning, the organoid's size reaches between 0.5 – 0.7 mm. For the first week, the 2 mL of medium per well of the 6-well plate will be half-changed every two days.\nNote: Prepare the OPC and ND media before starting this step.\nWorking volume: 2.0 mL per well of the 6-well plate\nDo not culture more than five organoids in one well of a 6-well plate.\nCulture on an orbital shaker at 85 RPM.\nMedium change: every other day.\nGradually transfer the organoids to either the ND medium or OPC medium. Please refer to the section of regional patterning for forebrain organoids for detailed medium change. The 2 mL of medium will be half-changed for a week and entirely changed for the second week every other day.\nVentral organoids → OPC media\nDorsal organoids → ND media\nCritical: We strongly recommend checking dorsal organoids frequently in the process of neuronal differentiation. Healthy organoids exhibit bright and clear surfaces without debris under the microscope. Unhealthy organoids, which can be identified by either the increasing debris over time in medium or organoids gradually turning darker, may compromise the rest of the procedure, including oligodendrogenesis (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/572-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Representative example showing bright-field images of organoids\n(A) Representative of an unhealthy organoid with debris in the medium. Scale bar, 100 μm.\n(B) Representative of a healthy organoid with clear surface. Scale bar, 100 μm.",
    "Note: At week 4, oligodendroglial lineage cells can be identified by nuclear localization of OLIG2 using an antibody specific for OLIG2 (Phosphosolutions, 1:1000). Immunostaining with βIIIT (Millipore, 1:200) and S100β (Sigma, 1:1000) antibodies can be utilized for identifying neuronal or astroglial lineage, respectively (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for antibodies).\nNeuronal maturation in organoids (week 4–6)\nTiming: 2 weeks\nFor fusion, this step of neuronal maturation applies only to week 6 DFO but not to the VFO at week 2, the time point that VFOs are used for fusion. In the fused organoids, neuronal maturation and activity in DFO achieved by this step can influence oligodendrogenesis and myelination. For unfused organoids, MBP signals, a marker for mature oligodendrocytes, can be detected in VFOs that had undergone this full neuronal maturation process.\nPrepare the BrainPhys neuronal medium before starting this step.\nWorking volume: 2.0 mL per well of the 6-well plate\nDo not culture more than five organoids in one well of a 6-well plate.\nCulture on an orbital shaker at 85 RPM.\nMedium change: every four days.\nGradually transfer the organoids to BrainPhys neuronal medium. The 2 mL of medium will be half-changed for a week and fully changed for the second week every four days.\nNote: At week 6, neuronal activity and maturation in organoids can be measured by immunostaining with c-Fos antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:100) and synaptic markers such as Synapsin 1 (Millipore, 1:400) and PSD-95 (Invitrogen, 1:100) (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] for antibodies).\nNote: A dorsal organoid that had undergone full neuronal maturation with BrainPhys is used with a patterned ventral organoid for the next fusion step. Assembly of VFOs at later stages of differentiation will take longer (2–3 days) along with increased cell death.",
    "Critical: Minimize the impact of medium composition transition by a half-changing medium. Avoid cell death/breaking of the organoids.\nAssembly of ventral and dorsal organoids (week 4 and 6 for VFO and DFO, respectively)\nTiming: ∼ 2 days\nThis step provides a detailed procedure for fusing forebrain organoids using a spontaneous fusion method (Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/572-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Representative images showing the organoids during the fusion process\nThe images correspond to the indicated fusion procedural step up to 3 weeks, in which organoids undergo dramatic changes in shape; scale bar, 100 μm.\nUse P200 pipette with a widened tip using sterile scissors to create a wider opening.\nMix the ND and OPC medium at a 1:1 ratio for this fusion step.\nTransfer two organoids into a well of the low-attachment 96-well round-bottom plate.\nPlace the plate in a humidified 37°C with 5% CO2 incubator.\nLeave them in static condition for 2 h without agitation.\nAfter 2 h, circulate medium two times by gentle pipetting up and down every h for 8 h without touching organoids.\n8 h later, transfer the fused organoids into a low attachment 6-well plate.\nPlace the fused organoids in a 6-well plate on an orbital shaker with a speed of 85 rpm.\nCritical: Without circulation by gentle pipetting, cell death can occur, especially from ventral organoids.\nOptional: If the organoids have not been firmly attached, the organoids can be maintained up to 18 h in the low attachment 96-well plate.\nMyelination and maturation\nTiming: ∼2 months\nTwo days after fusion, the organoids will be maintained in OL/ND media for long-term culture.\nSwitch media from ND/OPC media to OL/ND media by gradually changing half of the medium every other day for the first week. Maintain these organoids with media change every four days afterward.",
    "Note: During this period, fused organoids will become round-shaped with a diameter of 1.2–2 mm. They remain steady in size at a week after fusion.\nNote: At week 9, PDGFRα+ and/or MBP+ oligodendroglial lineages can be confirmed using immunostaining with specific antibodies for PDGFRα (Santa Cruz, 1:50) and MBP (Millipore, 1:100; Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]). Additionally, enhanced neuronal network during the long-term culture can be measured by the expression of genes for both inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic machinery, such as HOMER1 and SHANK3 that respectively encode excitatory postsynaptic components and ARHGEF9 and GPHN that respectively encode inhibitory postsynaptic components.
