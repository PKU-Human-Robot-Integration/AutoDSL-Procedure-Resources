  "procedures": [
    "The intubation procedure outlined below was approved by the Barcelona University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (CEEA 180/19)\n1. Experimental preparation\nObtain the following materials: 2 mm diameter polyvinyl chloride (PVC) endotracheal tube, 6 French (Fr) polyurethane feeding tube, flat and wide tip dissection forceps and sterile lubricant (Figure 1).\nDuring the intubation and surgery processes, maintain sterile conditions.\n2. Anesthesia\nAnesthetize the animal with 5 mg/kg xylazine and 25 mg/kg ketamine applied together intramuscularly in the vastus lateralis of the femoral quadriceps. Alpha-2 agonists such as dexmedetomidine can also be used instead of xylazine.\nAllow 3-5 minutes for the medication to reach effect.\nReadminister the same dose until deep anesthesia is achieved (negative pedal, palpebral and corneal reflexes). Ideally, the rabbit will maintain spontaneous breathing until intubation.\n3. Endotracheal intubation\nPlace the rabbit on a thermal blanket at 37 °C. Place the animal in dorsal recumbency with the head in hyperextension. Align the head as straight and midline as possible. A four-centimeter roll made of sterile gauze placed in the dorsal region of the neck may be helpful to achieve at least 45° of extension (Figure 2).\nUse flat and wide tip dissection forceps to open the oral cavity approximately one centimeter wide. Use forceps with a blunt and wide end to avoid mouth trauma.\nMeasure the distance between mouth and the region of stomach (first rib). Introduce a lubricated 6 French (Fr) polyurethane gastric tube to the pre-measured mark (Figure 3-4).\nMove the feeding tube to the left and fix with adhesive tape to the surgical field.\nIntroduce the 2 mm diameter PVC endotracheal tube, covered with sterile lubricant to the 3 cm mark.",
    "If there are any difficulties in advancing the tube, move it completely and reattempt until a smooth glide is achieved. The risk of trauma to the larynx and epiglottis is significant with multiple intubation attempts. Fix the tube with adhesive tape to the surgical field (Figure 5-6).\nConnect the endotracheal tube to the ventilator with following settings: Tidal volume - 10 mL/kg; respiratory rate: 40 breaths/min; FiO2 100%, PEEP 6.\nConfirm the correct position of the tube by the detection of CO2 in exhaled air (ETCO2), direct visualization of thoracic expansion and fogging of the tube. Monitoring of the animal by pulse oximetry and lung auscultation can also be helpful (Figure 7).\nAt the conclusion of the experiment, use a standardized euthanasia protocol that consists of intravenous administration of pentobarbital 120-240 mg/kg. Repeat doses until breath cessation, reflex absence and asystole are acheived.\n\tNOTE: In the surgical experiments, the animal is alive during the ventilation process and finally is euthanized.\nSubscription Required.
