    "1. Inoculate mycelia into 100 ml PDB media \\(200 g potato, 20 g dextrose, 1 L water) in 250 ml flasks. \n  2. Cultivate the mycelia were cultivated in the dark at 28°C under continuous shaking at 50 rpm. \n  3. Harvest the culturesby filtering through sterile gauze.\n  4. Place approximately 5 g of mycelia in a 50 ml tube containing 20 ml of filter-sterilized 1.5% lywallzyme \\(Guangdong Institute of Microbiology, China) in 0.6 M mannitol. \n  5. Incubate the mixtureat 30°C for approximately 2 h with occasional agitation. \n  6. Remove hyphae fragments after 2 h of digestion. MYG agar medium \\(2% malt extract, 0.2% yeast extract, 2% dextrose, 1.5% agar) was used for G. lucidum protoplast regeneration. \n  7. Dilute the protoplast suspension was diluted to 1 x 10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml, and 50 µl of the diluted protoplast suspension was added to a MYG medium plate and inoculated at 25°C in the dark."
