    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nYeast cell culture and metabolic labeling with propargylcholine\nTiming: 5 min to inoculate cells; 48 h to culture yeast; 30 min to label yeast with propargylcholine.\nYeast is cultured in a liquid medium to a density appropriate for experimental purposes and incubated with propargylcholine for a short duration to label only de novo synthesized PtdCho.\nInoculate yeast cells on an agar plate in 2 mL of SD + CA + ATU medium in a culture tube (approx. 16 mL in capacity) and grow at 30°C while shaking at 200 rpm for 12–16 h.\nMeasure optical density at 600 nm (OD600) using a spectrophotometer and dilute the yeast culture with 10 mL of SD + CA + ATU medium to an OD600 of 0.001 in a glass conical flask and grow at 30°C with shaking at 200 rpm.\nGrow yeast cells until they reach an appropriate density.\nTransfer 3 mL of the yeast culture to a new culture tube and add 3 μL of 1 M propargylcholine to the final concentration of 1 mM.\nCulture yeast for an additional 30 min at 30°C while shaking at 200 rpm.\nOptional: To examine the distribution of de novo synthesized PtdCho in autophagic cells, cells at the density of OD600 = 0.8–1.0 are used to ensure robust induction of autophagy. They are rinsed once with DW and cultured in an autophagy-inducing medium (e.g., synthetic defined medium without nitrogen) for an appropriate duration (e.g., 2 h) before the administration of propargylcholine.\nNote: Negative controls can be prepared by culturing cells without propargylcholine, or by culturing cells with a mixture of 1 mM propargylcholine and an excessive amount of choline (e.g., 5 mM).",
    "Critical: The duration of incubation with propargylcholine can be changed, but as it becomes longer, PtdCho synthesized for a longer period of time will be labeled, thus decreasing the temporal resolution of the method. Conversely, if the duration of incubation is too short, the signal may be too weak to be detected.\nClick labeling for fluorescence microscopy\nTiming: 30 min for fixation and permeabilization of cells; 40 min for the click chemical reaction.\nFluorescence microscopy is useful for checking the specificity of the click reaction, overall distribution of labeling, cell-to-cell variation, etc.\nCollect cells by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 1 min and discard the supernatant carefully.\nSuspend cells in 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer by pipetting and incubate for 15 min at RT with gentle agitation.\nNote: Use freshly prepared 4% formaldehyde.\nCollect cells by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 1 min and rinse them once with an ample volume of PBS.\nResuspend cells in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and incubate for 10 min with gentle agitation (e.g., 50 rpm) on a shaker or a rotator.\nNote: Triton X-100 is used to permeabilize membranes and enable penetration of the click chemical reaction solution throughout cells.\nCollect cells by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 1 min and rinse them twice with an ample volume of 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 1 min.\nPrepare the click reaction solution as below. The final solution contains 0.1 mM CuSO4, 0.1 mM TBTA, 2.5 mM ascorbic acid, and 500 nM AFDye546 picolyl-azide in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).\nMix 1 μL of 1 M CuSO4, 10 μL of 10 mM TBTA in DMSO, and 5 μL of 0.5 M ascorbic acid in DW in a 1.5 mL microtube.",
    "Leave the solution for 10 min at RT.\nAdd 983 μL of 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 μL of 0.5 mM AFDye546 picolyl-azide to the tube and mix well.\nAdd the click reaction solution to pelleted cells, suspend them by pipetting, and incubate for 20 min at RT.\nCollect cells by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 1 min and rinse them three times with an ample volume of 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).\nPut the cell pellet between the glass slide and the coverslip using an appropriate mounting medium (e.g., VECTASHIELD) and observe under a fluorescence microscope (Excitation 554 nm/Emission 570 nm).\nNote: As controls, solutions without either CuSO4 or AFDye546 picolyl-azide can be used to check the specificity of the reaction.\nCritical: The click reaction solution must be prepared immediately before use.\nPreparation and treatment of replicas and click reaction\nTiming: 3 h for quick freezing and preparation of freeze-fracture replicas; 24 h for cleaning the replicas; 1 h for click reaction.\nFreeze-fracture replicas are reacted in the click chemical reaction solution, and biotin conjugated to the alkyne residue of the PtdCho headgroup is labeled with colloidal gold particles.\nPerform quick-freezing and prepare freeze-fracture replicas as described in Fujita et al. (2010)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2] and Tsuji et al. (2019)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7].\nNote: For quick-freezing and freeze-fracture replica preparation, refer to instrument manuals for concrete operation.\nNote: Quick-freezing stops molecular motion instantaneously and freeze-fracture physically stabilizes membranes and preserves distribution of lipids and proteins in the membrane.\nIncubate replicas in PBS containing 20 μg/mL Zymolyase, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol, and 1% BSA for 2 h at 37°C.\nIncubate replicas in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 2.5% SDS at 60°C for 12–16 h.",
    "Note: Freeze-fracture replicas of yeast need to be digested with Zymolyase to remove the cell wall and then treated with SDS to remove adhering proteins (Cheng et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]). For mammalian cells, SDS treatment suffices.\nPause point: Replicas before or after the Zymolyase–SDS treatment can be stored in PBS containing 50% glycerol at –20°C for months.\nRinse the freeze-fracture replicas three times with 0.001% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).\nNote: This step and most of the following steps are done in the wells of a porcelain spot plate (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]), in which replicas are observed more clearly than in transparent plastic vessels. Each well can contain approx. 0.5 mL of the solution. Replicas can be transferred to a new well using a micropipette with a 10 μL tip. For each step, solutions need to be agitated thoroughly by repeated pipetting. We repeat pipetting more than 20 times for each step.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1214-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Illustration of washing/blocking and labeling steps\nBars = 50 mm (upper, middle); 3 mm (lower).\nTreat the replicas with 2% cold fish gelatin and 0.001% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) for 10 min at RT.\nNote: This blocking is effective for reducing non-specific labeling in freeze-fracture replicas (Iyoshi et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]).\nPrepare the click reaction solution as below. The final solution contains 1 mM CuSO4, 2.5 mM ascorbic acid, 0.1 mM TBTA, 2% cold fish gelatin, and 5 μM biotin-azide in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).\nMix 1 μL of 1 M CuSO4, 10 μL of 10 mM TBTA, and 5 μL of 0.5 M ascorbic acid in a 1.5 mL microtube.\nLeave the solution for 10 min at RT.",
    "Add 983 μL of 2% cold fish gelatin in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.5 μL of 10 mM biotin-azide to the tube and mix well.\nCritical: Click reaction solution must be prepared immediately before use.\nNote: As controls, solutions without either CuSO4 or biotin-azide can be used to confirm the specificity of the reaction.\nIncubate the replicas in a click reaction solution for 30 min at RT.\nRinse the replicas five times with 0.001% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and once with PBST.\nImmunogold labeling\nTiming: 16 h\nIncubate the replicas with 2% cold fish gelatin in PBS for 30 min at RT.\nRinse the replicas with PBS once.\nIncubate the replicas with mouse anti-biotin antibody (5–10 μg/mL) in PBS containing 1% cold fish gelatin for 12–16 h at 4°C.\nNote: Centrifuge the diluted antibody solution at 21,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min and use the supernatant. The incubation with antibodies is performed on a sheet of Parafilm using 50–100 μl of solution in a sealed container with a wet sheet of filter paper (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]). The concentration of antibodies may need to be adjusted by trial and error. Once blocked with 2% cold fish gelatin, 1% is sufficient to prevent non-specific reaction during the antibody reaction.\nRinse the replicas five times with PBST.\nIncubate the replicas with goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated with 12 nm colloidal gold (GAM12) in 50–100 μL of PBS containing 1% BSA for 30 min at 37°C.\nNote: We generally dilute the colloidal gold-conjugated antibody in 1:20, but an appropriate dilution may vary for each lot. Centrifuge the GAM12 diluted solution at 200 × g at 4°C for 5 min and use the supernatant.\nRinse the replicas five times with 0.1% BSA in PBS.",
    "Rinse the replicas twice with DW.\nPick up the replicas on Formvar-coated EM grids (50 mesh, copper) and dry on filter paper (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nCritical: Do not let replicas dry until step 30. Inclusion of BSA or detergent in solutions prevents replicas from sticking to the porcelain spot plate and pipette tip.\nPause point: Replicas that are labeled and picked up on EM grids can be stored in a grid box or other appropriate container for months to years.\nData acquisition and analysis\nTiming: 1–2 days\nTake photos randomly by transmission electron microscope. Colloidal gold particles of 12 nm in diameter can be easily observed in images at a magnification of 15,000 × or higher.\nCollect images containing membranes of interest (e.g., cytosolic leaflet of the ER).\nNote: For quantification, we generally use more than 15 images for each membrane of interest.\nMeasure the area of membranes (μm2) using ImageJ, count the number of colloidal gold labels, and calculate the density of gold labels (labels/μm2) for each area.\nCompare the result statistically using the Mann-Whitney U test or other appropriate methods (Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1214-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

The data pairs can be analyzed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test using the statistical language R."
