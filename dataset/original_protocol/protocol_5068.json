    "Figure 1 illustrates the experimental setup and electrode placement. In order to determine AP conduction velocity, it is important to keep in mind that there are differences in the procedure for measuring stimulated APs (Figure 1A) and spontaneously generated APs (Figure 1B). Especially in the latter case, it is crucial that APs are not initiated between the two recording sites, as this will result in wrong velocity measurements. APs can spread bi-directionally from their site of initiation, and if APs are initiated between the two recording sites, the measured difference in AP arrival times between recording sites is not representative of APs travelling the distance between the two (Figure 1C, and also step B2). Thus, in the following, detailed procedures are given for measuring conduction velocity of: A.Stimulated APs by means of extracellular stimulation B.Spontaneously initiated APs In both cases, AP conduction velocity is measured as a function of the time the AP needs to travel from one site on an axon/nerve to another site (= ‘latency’). Conduction velocity can be calculated using:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170227/20170227032625_2187.jpgWith v as the conduction velocity,∆x as the spatial distance between recording sites, ∆t as the time difference between recording sites (latency).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170227/20170227025601_8206.jpgFigure 1. Representation of the electrode placement for measuring conduction velocity of stimulated APs (A) and spontaneously generated APs (B & C). A. Left: APs are initiated within the stimulation well and propagate along the axon (green arrows) towards the recording well. Note that APs propagate bi-directionally but are only detected at the recording site. Δx represents the distance between the stimulation and recording wells. Right: Extracellular recording of a nerve showing the latency (Δt) between the onset of the stimulation (stim. artifact) and the AP (gray box). B. Left: Correct electrode placement for measuring conduction velocity of spontaneously generated APs.",
    "Recording wells need to be placed in such a way that the AP is passing the wells without being initiated in-between the wells. Right: The latency in AP occurrence at the two recording sites reflects the time the AP needs to propagate from recording 1 to recording 2. C. Left: Incorrect electrode placement for measuring conduction velocity of spontaneously generated APs. Right: The latency between the two recording sites is small and it only reflects that the AP was initiated spatially closer to recording 1 than to recording 2.Measuring conduction velocity of stimulated APsThe advantage of measuring conduction velocity of stimulated APs is that AP initiation is controlled by the experimenter. Thus, different AP frequencies can be tested, and APs can reliably be elicited in many different conditions (e.g., at different temperatures or in distinct neuromodulatory conditions). However, because the largest axons respond to the lowest stimulation amplitudes, measuring the velocities of small diameter axons may not be feasible with extracellular stimulation.Dissect the nerve of interest. Note: The dissected nerve should be long enough that the two wells constructed in step 2 are separate, and the entire length of the nerve contains the axon of interest. For a detailed protocol how to dissect the stomatogastric nervous system of C. borealis please review Gutierrez and Grashow (2009).Establish the extracellular recording and stimulation as described in companion protocol ‘Extracellular axon stimulation’ by Städele, C., DeMaegd, M. and Stein, W. For electrode placement see Figure 1A.  After determining the AP stimulation threshold, continuously stimulate the axon with a low frequency stimulation (1 to 2 Hz).Identify the AP on the extracellular recording (Figure 1A, right). Note: The stimulated AP will travel from the stimulation electrode to the recording site. From one stimulus pulse to the next, AP amplitude and shape should not change.",
    "Similarly, the latency between the stimulation onset and the AP occurrence should remain constant. If there is no consistency of AP amplitude or latency, then either no AP was elicited or the elicited AP does not pass the recording site, indicating that the axon might be damaged or might project through a different nerve.Measure conduction velocity as described in Data analysis.Variation of the experiment: In many axons, AP conduction velocity is frequency-dependent (Miller and Rinzel, 1981; Weidner et al., 2002) and/or history-dependent (Ballo et al., 2012; Kiernan et al., 1997). To test whether this is the case for the axon of interest, increase the stimulation frequency and observe whether conduction velocity changes as a function of frequency and/or number of APs. Instead of stimulating at a constant frequency, more biological relevant pulse sequences may be applied, such as burst-like changes in frequency (Ballo and Bucher, 2009).Measuring conduction velocity of spontaneously generated APsConduction velocity measurements of spontaneously initiated APs does not require extracellular nerve stimulation. Many axons spontaneously generate APs, and accordingly, most nerve recordings show spontaneously occurring APs. By using spontaneously generated APs, the conduction velocities of small diameter axons can be assessed. However, the occurrence and frequency of the APs cannot be controlled by the experimenter. We are using the anterior gastric receptor neuron (AGR; Smarandache and Stein, 2007) of the stomatogastric nervous system of the Jonah crab (Cancer borealis) as an example. AGR spontaneously generates tonic spike activity (2 to 5 Hz) in its axon trunk that can be measured with extracellular electrodes (Daur et al., 2009; Städele and Stein, 2016). Dissect the nerve of interest. Then, instead of one stimulation and one recording well, both will be used as recording wells (Figure 1B).",
    "Connect the cable of the stimulation electrode to a second channel of the extracellular amplifier. Note: If the neuron of interest is bipolar or able to generate ectopic APs (e.g., Daur et al., 2009), make sure that the site where APs are initiated is not in between the two recording wells since the measured latencies will not reflect travel times between recording sites (Figure 1C). If necessary, this can be determined by adding a third recording well. The order at which the APs arrive at the recordings wells will be indicative of the initiation site. If either of the two outside wells records the AP first, the correct velocity can be measured using the difference in arrival times between the other recording wells. If the center well records the AP first, use longest latency between center and outside wells. Identify the AP of interest on the extracellular recordings. Note: The AP of interest should appear with a constant latency between both recording sites. Its shape and amplitude may differ between recording sites, but should be consistent for each site. If the AP of interest is not the largest unit on the extracellular recording, or difficult to identify for other reasons, see Notes. Measure conduction velocity as described in Data analysis."
