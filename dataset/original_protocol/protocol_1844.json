    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nMicroscope and image setting for the different cell types\nTiming: 5–10 min\nTo perform cellular contractility experiments, a standard microscope coupled with a digital camera is necessary. The microscope contrast needs to be sufficient to identify the cellular membrane. Importantly, the magnification must allow the user to visualize the whole cell, typically requiring between 20×–40× magnification with a pixel size of 0.2–0.5 μm. In order to capture a high-quality image and fully detect the entire cell movement, both microscope resolution and image pixel size should be smaller than the sarcomere length, which is around 1.8 μm (Li et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9]; Pollack and Huntsman, 1974[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib14]). Due to differences in cell contractility speed within the different cell types, a camera should have a frame rate ranging from 25 to 200 fps (see Table 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#tbl1] for details).\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1437_4.csv\nDifferent cell types may require specific microscope settings, and to achieve the best contrast, some adjustments to diaphragm aperture, focus, and light intensity may be necessary. The mature sarcomere structure found in adult cardiomyocytes provides robust contrast for contraction measurements. In comparison, neonatal-CMs and hiPSC-CMs have intrinsically lower contrast due to the absence of an organized sarcomere structure and lack of a t-tubule system (Bedada et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Khan et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8]; Li et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). In addition, contractility can be significantly affected by differences in cardiomyocyte structural maturity. Neonatal-CMs and hiPSC-CMs not only have weaker contraction compared to adult-CMs, but their syncytium self-organization can also contract spontaneously (Bedada et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]; Bezzerides et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib2]; Li et al., 2017[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10]). These characteristics require slightly different microscope settings between these types of cells.",
    "Critical: An inappropriate microscope setting will directly influence the acquisition of contractility that is obtained through cell membrane movement, reflecting in a poor measurement of the contractility parameters.\nFocus: the focus should be adjusted until the cell border is delimited with minimum edge brightness (see Focus on Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1], 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2], and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]). Small adjustments should be made to the fine focus control until the cell border is sharp and without any optical bloom.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1437-Fig1.jpg\nFigure 1. Optimal brightfield microscope settings for adult-CMs\n(A) Focus: Out-of-focus cells present a bright halo around the cell border and poor resolution of intracellular structures. Use the fine focus control to minimize border brightness and to bring intracellular structures into sharp focus. Diaphragm: changes in the diaphragm drastically alter cell visualization. A fully-opened diaphragm (100%) results in low contrast whereas a closed-down diaphragm (10%) produces sufficient contrast but an overall-all dark image. Mean gray value (MGV): Lighting and camera settings should be adjusted so that the gray value histogram is centered on the half-maximal range (127 for an 8-bit image), with no pixel intensities close to zero or to saturation. Ideal settings are highlighted in the red rectangle.\n(B) Gray value histogram acquired for each condition presented in (A). For greater precision, the variation of illumination should be observed from the gray value histogram, generated by the camera's application program or the image can be processed by ImageJ software.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1437-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Optimal brightfield microscope settings for neonatal-CMs",
    "(A) Focus: Out-of-focus cells present a bright halo around the cell border and poor resolution of intracellular structures. Use the fine focus control to minimize border brightness and to bring intracellular structures into sharp focus. Diaphragm: changes in the diaphragm drastically alter cell visualization, when it is fully open (100%) the cell does not have a clear delimitation and contrast. When it is partially 10% opened the cell has a dark border, indicating poor lighting of the cell. Therefore, normally in a brightfield microscope, the diaphragm should be 30% opened to get the best contrast. Mean gray value (MGV): In an 8-bit image, the best illumination will be proportional to the average total pixels of the image, which in this case will be 127. Smaller values do not produce good lighting, and larger values produce an excess of illumination and can reach exaggerated pixel intensity. Ideal settings are highlighted in the red rectangle.\n(B) Gray value histogram acquired for each condition presented in (A). For greater precision, the variation of illumination should be observed from the gray value histogram, generated by the camera's own application program or the image can be processed by the ImageJ software.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1437-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3.

For greater precision, the variation of illumination should be observed from the gray value histogram, generated by the camera's own application program or the image can be processed by the ImageJ software.\nNote: For adult-CMs, the focus should be optimized to obtain the greatest amount of black and white variation longitudinally, providing a clear visualization of sarcomere striations (see Focus on Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A). For neonatal-CM or hiPSC-CM, intracellular vesicles or cell nuclei can be used as a reference to find the best focus. Well-focused vesicles usually will have a black interior and both vesicles and nuclei should have a well-defined border (see Focus on Figures 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).",
    "Diaphragm aperture (Condenser lens): Start with the microscope setup for Kohler illumination. Open the diaphragm fully, which results in a cell image with low contrast and with little cell border delineation (see panel Diaphragm 100% in Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A, 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]A, and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A). Slowly close the diaphragm until the delineation of the cell edge and nucleus appear and contrast is optimized.\nNote: For adult-CMs, good contrast can generally be obtained with the diaphragm 20%–30% open (see Diaphragm 30% Figure 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]A), and for neonatal-CM or hiPSC-CM, 30% (see Diaphragm 30% Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]A).\nMean gray value (MGV): Pixel brightness is converted into a grayscale value that is the primary information in an image. Usually, an 8-bit image is sufficient to acquire the cell contractility parameters. This kind of image has a grayscale that ranges from 0 to 255, and the ideal illumination intensity will nearly fill this range, leaving a margin of error to guarantee that no pixels go below camera sensitivity or above saturation. Thus, the best approach is to adjust lighting and camera settings to set the background close to 127, which is the middle of this range. This procedure can be carried out using a grayscale value histogram plot (Figures 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig1]B, 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]B, and 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3]B).\nNote: The histogram plot can be usually acquired in real time through the software camera acquisition, or the image can be captured, stored, and processed by ImageJ software (‘Analyze’> ‘Histogram’ or Ctrl + h).\nCritical: Make sure that the combination of these steps (focus, diaphragm and mean gray value) leads to the best contrast image.\nCamera setting and image collection for the different cell types\nTiming: 5 min",
    "The first step to cell imaging acquisition is to set up the camera for image collection. Importantly, different cell types require specific parameters, such as image size and capture rate, and they must be set before starting the experiment.\nIn the camera software:\nSelect the image window size to record just the area of interest around the cell. For adult-CMs experiments, using the magnification (40×) and pixel size (0.25 μm/pixel) of our microscope (see Microscope resolution), an image window size of 640 horizontal ×200 vertical pixels allows most cells to fit within the image. Neonatal-CM or and hiPSC-CM require a field of view, and an image window size of 640 × 480 pixels is our standard configuration for these cells.\nNote: If in the experiment more than 5% of the adult-CMs does not fit within the image window, increase the height or width window size. For many cameras, variation of the window height does not affect the maximum frame rate that can be acquired, which is limited by the window width. Therefore, it is easier to change the height size to find the best window size.\nCritical: The resolution window size must be the same within and across experimental groups to provide the best comparison.\nBackground correction\nTo acquire a clearer image without background interference, we recommend the use of background correction (for details, see Troubleshooting - problem 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1]).\nSelect the capture frame rate",
    "The capture frame rate is an important parameter to acquire a complete and robust contraction-relaxation cycle wave. To do so, it is important to keep in mind that mature cells have a greater contraction speed and contraction area compared to immature cells, and therefore, require higher frame rates. To find the best rate, note that the minimum acquisition period to reliably reconstruct a signal needs to be smaller than half the time of the fastest component (Nyquist, 1928[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12]). For more details see Scalzo et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16] (User Manual provided as Methods S1, section 2.2 Requirements, subsection: Minimum frame rate).\nNote: The frame rate and the intrinsic noise produced by the cell movement can influence the way the data is visualized (for more details, see Troubleshooting - problem 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3]).\nSave images\nThe camera should be connected to the computer through a USB 3.0 interface, to provide high frame rate acquisition. Most of the camera software allows capturing and storing the image in different ways. The best way to avoid variation in the capture rate value is to choose the option that first stores the images in the RAM, and then the user saves manually in computer HD.\nCritical: Make sure that throughout image acquisition the capture rate remains at the desired speed during all the capture time. Sometimes, there is a slight variation in the camera capture rate. Be aware that the variation must not exceed 1% of the desired value.\nContractility assay in cardiomyocytes\nAdult-CM experiments\nTiming: 1–4 h",
    "The adult-CM usually has a robust contraction and a good cell image contrast (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]), allowing an easier image acquisition compared to more immature neonatal cells (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]) and hiPSC-CMs (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]). However, since healthy adult-CM require electrical stimulation to contract, and exhibit a higher degree of heterogeneity compared to immature cells, some steps are essential to acquire the contraction properly:\nAssemble the cell-stimulation chamber and fix it onto the stage of the microscope.\nNote: In our cellular contractility experiments, isolated adult-CMs must be plated on a suitable chamber. Our laboratory utilizes a commercial chamber (model ChamlideIC-CU: 109, Live Cell Instrument, Nowan-gu, Korea) (see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table]). However, any mini-incubator with temperature and CO2 control (when required) should work. Usually, the chamber can be attached to the microscope through a specific stage provided with the incubation system.\nSet the temperature to 37°C. Position the recording chamber and platinum electrodes that will provide the field stimulation to generate the cell action potential.\nTurn on the stimulator and set up the parameters (frequency, voltage, and pulse width duration).\nResuspend the dissociated adult-CM in the Tyrode solution.\nNote: High cellular density can impair single cell visualization, so dilution is recommended (for more details, see Troubleshooting - problem 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5]).\nGently homogenize the cell solution and add a few drops of cells in the chamber at 37°C until the experiment starts. Wait at least 1 min for the cells to settle. Usually, the cells attach to the surface without any coated substrates. However, different types of experiments may require the surface to be coated with laminin or another matrix solution (e.g., cell perfusion experiments).",
    "Select a healthy cardiomyocyte, position the cell in the center of the field of view, and rotate the camera as necessary to align the long axis of the cell with the horizontal axis of the image window. To distinguish between healthy and unhealthy cells, please see Troubleshooting - problem 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7]. Due to the strength of their contractions, adult-CMs can occasionally detach from the surface, changing the alignment. However, even in this case, the analysis can be performed provided that no part of the cell leaves the image field of view.\nAdjust the adult-CM image focus as described in the “microscope and image setting for the different cell types[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]” section.\nStart the camera recorder.\nTurn on the stimulator.

    "For a healthy control cardiomyocyte, starting with the cell at rest, the first contraction will be the strongest one, as the sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium store is full. As the stimulation sequence proceeds, there is a decay in the cell shortening of each subsequent contraction through calcium homeostasis. Control cells generally reach a steady state after 10–15 contractions, although this can vary from animal to animal and experimental conditions, such as the temperature setting. After the cell contraction amplitude reaches steady-state, record relevant contractility data.\nCritical: In healthy cardiomyocytes, the cells must contract in synchrony with the stimulation. Moreover, before electrical pacing begins, the cells should be quiescent. Cells that contract in the absence of stimulation or that present arrhythmic events (Methods videos S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4] and S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]) should be excluded from the analysis.\nNote: To obtain the CM fractional shortening, the cell border must be well defined.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \nMethods video S4.

    "Critical: The temperature and the culture medium can strongly impact cardiomyocyte contractility. Hence, subtle variations in these parameters can drastically alter cellular contractility results. In our experiment, we use Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s culture medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for neonatal-CM and RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 μM of Y27632 for hiPSC-CM (for more details, see key resources table[href=https://www.wicell.org#key-resources-table] and Materials and equipment). However, different types of experiments may require a specific culture medium. Wait at least 5 min to stabilize the cell temperature at 37°C.\nSelect the cell in the region of interest (ROI) in the camera image field according to the steps described in the “microscope and image setting for the different cell types[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec3.1]” section.\nNote: It is recommended to acquire the data in a syncytium where all cell contractions are synchronized and that have similar areas and number of cells (that can be estimated by counting cell nuclei). Images of multiple syncytia or an unsynchronized syncytium will not show a typical signal to be analyzed. In neonatal-CM culture select the cell area without debris or fibroblasts (for details see Troubleshooting - problem 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9]).\nImportantly, the size of the pre-set window should be adjusted accordingly and be kept the same throughout the entire experiment. If the syncytium is too big and does not fit in the image, a tip is to look for and acquire the contraction at its center of convergence. Acquire the cell contractility for at least 15 s.\nSaving images\nImages should be saved at a depth of at least 8-bit. There are three standard ways to store contractility images:\nImage sequence: a folder containing multiple images in sequence.\nMultipage image: one TIFF file.\nVideo file data: one video with .avi extension.",
    "It is recommended that images are saved using the TIFF file format. Many other common image formats, such as JPEG, use image compression resulting in loss of information. However, if HD space limitations require the use of compressed file formats, it is important to be aware of the possibility of information loss and to consistently use the same file format in all experimental groups that will be compared.\nContractility analysis using CONTRACTIONWAVE\nOnce high-quality data is acquired, the analysis of contractility parameters can be performed using a variety of available software programs (IonWizard Ionoptix; Boudaoud et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib3]; Grune et al., 2019[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]; Maddah et al., 2015[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib11]; Pasqualin et al., 2016[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib13]; Sala et al., 2018[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib15]). The authors have developed CONTRACTIONWAVE (Scalzo et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]), a high-performance Python program that processes video micrograph films using dense optical flow image analysis. This program has been validated for large-scale analysis of different cell types (adult-, neonatal- and hiPSC-CMs), treated or not with drugs, including both healthy cells and cells isolated from animal models of human disease. Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4] illustrates the CONTRACTIONWAVE window that shows the average speed of contraction-relaxation cycle results of an adult-CM that was electrically stimulated at 1 Hz and processed using the software.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/1437-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Analysis of cellular contractility using CONTRACTIONWAVE\n(A) CONTRACTIONWAVE data analysis window allows interval selections of the contraction-relaxation waves. The software automatically detects the average speed of the contraction-relaxation waves and allows for fine adjustments to improve peak detections (top panel). To assist single or multiple peak selection for data analysis, a zoomed version of the selected interval is displayed on the panel below (bottom panel).",
    "(B) CONTRACTIONWAVE simultaneously displays both the cell image (top panel) and the contraction-relaxation waves (bottom panel). The top panel shows the cardiomyocyte image with the magnitude and motions vectors of the contractility movement acquired during step (2) represented on the bottom panel (the orange area highlights the time in which the upper cell image was acquired). Note that the average speed corresponds to a single contraction-relaxation cycle of an electrically stimulated cardiomyocyte. Colored circles presented in the contraction-relaxation wave (bottom panel) represent (1) contraction initiation; (2) maximum contraction speed (MCS); (3) minimum contraction speed; (4) maximum relaxation speed (MRS); (5) return to baseline. Figure adapted from Scalzo et al. (2021)[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]\nIn the wave detection window, a time interval can be selected by the user (top panel, orange area, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). Once an interval is chosen, the program displays a zoomed plot of the selection in the window below (bottom panel, Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]A). An innovative feature of CONTRACTIONWAVE compared to other available software is its ability to display simultaneous views of the cell image and the derived contraction-relaxation wave (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]B). Contractility analysis using CONTRACTIONWAVE allows for the acquisition of three distinct types of parameters of the contraction-relaxation cycle: speed of contraction at different points along the cycle, time intervals between several important phases of contraction-relaxation cycle, and shortening area, in appropriate calibrated units. For a complete description and definition of all contractility parameters, please see Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3] in the original description of CONTRACTIONWAVE (Scalzo et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib16]).\nNote: CONTRACTIONWAVE is open-source software and all details for download, installation, and optimized use are fully described in Scalzo et al.
