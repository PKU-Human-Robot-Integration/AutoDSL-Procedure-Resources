    "Isolate hepatocytes from 8-15 week-old C57BL6/J mice according to Dentin et al. (2004). As previously described, coat the wells of a 6 wells-plate with collagen I (10 min at RT) and plate 1 million cells per well. After 2 h, change the medium with fresh M199.The next day, treat the cells with the non-stimulated (G5) and stimulated (G25i) conditions for 24 h:a.Low-glucose (G5): M199 media (glucose 5 mM) plus dexamethasone 10-7 M.b.High-glucose insulin (G25i): M199 media (glucose 5 mM) complemented to 25 mM glucose, plus insulin 100 nM and dexamethasone 10-7 M. Add acetate C14 (0.5 µCi per well [0.5 µl]) in the media. C14 will be incorporated in de novo synthetized lipids.After 2 h, wash the cells 2 times with PBS and scrap the cells of each well in 400 µl of PBS. Then the 400 µl is divided into 100 µl and 300 µl for protein quantification and lipid extraction respectively as described below.For protein quantification. Freeze at -20 °C to improve the lysis of the protein. (Optional: sonicate 15 sec in sonication water bath). Quantify using BCA protein assay.From the 300 µl left, perform lipid extraction under a chemical hood as follow. Add 100 µl of M199 media with phenol red to facilitate the recognition of the 2 phases in the later stage. Then add 1.6 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1) and vortex 5 to 10 min. Centrifuge 5 min at 15,000 x g (RCF) at RT and collect the organic phase (lower phase) with glass Pasteur pipet. The phenol red helps to distinguish two phases. Then evaporate under nitrogen blowing (approx. 20 to 40 min) and resuspend in 150 µl of chloroform/methanol (2:1).Add 1 cm of TLC migration solvent in the TLC developing chamber 20 min before loading the TLC plate in the TLC developing chamber.",
    "Mark a line with a pencil at 2 cm from the bottom of the TLC plate. Samples will be loaded every 1.5-2 cm on this line. Load 40 µl as a dot on the TLC plate. To avoid too large dots, at the same time you load, blow nitrogen for immediate drying.Load the TLC plate in the TLC developing chamber. Allow TLC plate migration to 1 cm of the top (approx. 45 min).(Optional) After TLC migration, the lipid can be visualised. Under the chemical hood, dry the TLC plate under the hood and colour lipid with iodine in a clean TLC chamber. Add some iodine stones in the bottom of the TLC chamber and place the TLC plate. Wait until the brown colour appears (10 to 20 min). You can take a picture under the hood or you can put the plate in a closed plastic bag for scanning. Recover the iodine stones in a close bottle (they can be used indefinitely). Note that the coloration disappears outside of the chamber. Remove the coloration under the hood (approx. 10 min). Expose the TLC to the MS Multisensitive Phosphor Screens for at least 5 days in a film cassette. Then scan the screen using Cyclone Plus Storage Phosphor Scanner (Figure 3).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20161030/20161030234133_4372.jpgFigure 3.

Samples from hepatocytes treated 24 h with G5 or G25i where load on the bottom of the plate. TGs are highlighted."
