    "Guide RNA (gRNA) design  Use the user-friendly VBC Score online tool (https://www.vbc-score.org/[href=https://www.vbc-score.org/]) (Michlits et al., 2020) to select gRNAs targeting the genes of interest. It is recommended to select two to three gRNAs per target gene. A high VBC score indicates high targeting efficiency and low off-target effects. The complete oligonucleotide sequences needed for cloning can be found in columns “GeCKO_cloning_FW” and “GeCKO_cloning_RV” in the Microsoft Excel files provided by the tool. The oligonucleotide sequences are as follows:Oligo forward: 5’-CACCG  NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN-3’Oligo reverse: 3’-C  NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN  CAAA-5’ Note: The PAM sequence is not included in the primers but is specified in the “sgRNA + NGG” column.  Order pre-mixed gRNA (forward and reverse) oligonucleotides in 96-well plate format from IDT (https://eu.idtdna.com[href=https://eu.idtdna.com]) as follows:table:\n﻿0,1,2,3\nPlate Specifications,Plate Specifications,Plate Specifications,Plate Specifications\nScale:,25 nmol DNA,,\nPurification:,Standard de-salted,,\nPlate type:,PCR,,\nLoading Scheme,Forward/Reverse mixed in wells,,\nShipping:,,,\nNormalization:,nmol/well,,\n,Amount per well:,4,nm\nIf wet:,Final concentration,40,micromolar\n,Final volume,100,microliters/well\n,Buffer:,IDTE buffer pH 8.0,IDTE buffer pH 8.0\n Preparation of gRNA expression vector  Digest 5,000 ng of the LentiGuide-Puro-P2A-EGFP backbone (Figure 1) for 2 h at 55 °C with the restriction enzyme BsmBI-v2 (Figure 2A).table:\n﻿0,1\nComponent,Volume/Amount\nLentiGuide-Puro.P2A-EGFP,\"5,000 ng\"\nBsmBI-v2,3 µL\nNEBuffer 3.1,5 µL\nddH2O,up to 50 µL (= final volume)\nimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4577/bioprotoc-12-24-4577-g001.jpg Figure 1.

    "Separate the backbone (approximately 9,000 bp) from the filler piece (1,885 bp) on a 0.7% agarose gel. Add an aliquot of undigested backbone to a separate gel pocket for comparison and to verify successful digestion of the backbone. Excise the band at approximately 9 kb with a scalpel and purify with a gel extraction kit. Elute DNA in 30–50 µL ddH2O. Note: As a considerable fraction of DNA is usually lost during gel purification, we recommend performing three to four digestion reactions in parallel and purify DNA from all bands using a single purification column. This will ensure obtaining sufficient quantities of backbone DNA.  Measure the concentration of the eluted DNA and dilute to 100 ng/µL with ddH2O. gRNA cloning in 96-well plate format  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4577/bioprotoc-12-24-4577-g002.jpg Figure 2.

Note: Distribute 5 µL bacteria with a multichannel pipette and streak them out using an inoculation loop.  Incubate overnight at 37 °C. Isolation of plasmids (backbone + gRNA)  Add 2 mL of LB medium + carbenicillin into each well of a 96-deep-well plate.Pick single colonies using an inoculation loop or a pipette tip.Incubate overnight at 37 °C on a shaker.On the next day, isolate plasmid DNA using Monarch®  Plasmid Miniprep kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.Measure plasmid DNA concentration using a spectrophotometer.Submit plasmid DNA to Sanger Sequencing using hU6 prom_fwd sequencing primer (GACTATCATATGCTTACCGT).Check sequencing results using appropriate software (e.g., Geneious Prime) (Figure 4).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4577/bioprotoc-12-24-4577-g004.jpg Figure 4. Example of sequence analysis using Geneious Prime  Cell culture  Notes:   For the arrayed CRISPR/Cas9 screen (Figure 5), we recommend the generation of a functional SpCas9-expressing clone from your cell line of interest.",
    "For validation, conduct a competition assay as described below using control gRNAs. For instance, in human cell lines, gRNAs targeting AAVS1 should be used as negative control, as the introduction of indels into this locus is not expected to have any effect on cellular fitness. gRNAs targeting RPL17 can be used as positive controls, as this gene is essential in most human cells.   It is recommended to perform all functional experiments in at least three biological replicates.   Transfection of Lenti-X cells with lentiviral constructs  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4577/bioprotoc-12-24-4577-g005.jpg Figure 5. Workflow for virus production, transduction of target cells in 96-well plate format, and functional analysis of gene knockouts using a flow cytometry–based competition assay.  Created with BioRender.com. Day 1:  Determine the concentration of all gRNA constructs and dilute to 20 ng/µL in ddH2O in a 96-well plate. This plate can be stored at -20 °C for later use.Culture Lenti-X 293T (Lenti-X) in 10 cm2  dishes in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 4 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 µg/mL streptomycin. Make sure cultures do not grow beyond confluency (≥60%–80%). For the transfection, remove the supernatant, wash once with 5–10 mL of PBS and detach cells by incubating them in 1 mL of trypsin solution for 3–5 min in the incubator. After detachment, resuspend cells in 10 mL of fresh medium.Dilute the cells to 1.4 × 105  cells/mL and transfer 100 µL per well to a flat-bottom 96-well plate. Day 2:  Prepare the transfection master mix as follows:table:",

    "Add 25 µL of master mix and 10 µL of each construct [20 ng/µL] to each well of a 96-well plate.Dilute PEI 1:10 in plain medium, add 12.6 µL per well, and mix thoroughly.Incubate for 25 min at RT.Carefully add 30 µL of each mix to the pre-seeded Lenti-X cells and incubate overnight. Note: From this step onwards, a BSL2 environment is required for work with virus particles.   Day 3:  Carefully remove the supernatant and replace with 170 µL per well of fresh medium. Note: Choose the fresh medium according to the growth medium of the cell line to be transduced. Since the chosen vector contains a fluorescent reporter, such as GFP, you can check the success of the transfection with a fluorescence microscope after changing the medium (Figure 6).  imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4577/bioprotoc-12-24-4577-g006.jpg Figure 6. Bright field (left) and fluorescence (right) microscope picture of Lenti-X cells 24 h post transfection (10×), showing expression of GFP   Day 4/5:  To harvest virus particles, carefully transfer 150 µL of supernatant from Lenti-X cells to a 96-well plate, store at 4 °C, and add 170 µL per well of the same medium to Lenti-X cells for an optional second harvest on the next day. Pool the second with the first harvest and freeze viruses in 100 µL of aliquots at -80 °C. Note: The infectious capacity of lentiviral particles may be reduced upon freezing. However, this step efficiently eliminates Lenti-X cells, which might eventually be present in the supernatant and contaminate target cells with Lenti-X cells during the transduction process.   Transduction of target suspension cells and setup of the flow cytometry–based competition assay  Count target cells and collect the required number of cells by centrifugation. Note: The supernatant obtained after centrifugation and filtering with a 0.",
    "45 µm filter can be kept at 4 °C and used as conditioned medium to supplement cells after the transduction. This is recommended for cells that are particularly susceptible to stress upon external perturbations, such as lentiviral infection. Optionally, the medium can be supplemented with 20% FBS during the transduction process to increase cell viability.  Resuspend cell pellet in medium to reach a concentration of 2 × 106  cells/mL and transfer 100 µL per well to a flat-bottom 96-well plate (= 2 × 105  cells/well).Pre-dilute polybrene to 100 µg/mL in the growth medium of target cells, add 8 µL to 100 µL of virus, and add the mix (virus + polybrene) to each 100 µL of cells (polybrene final = 4 µg/mL).Centrifuge the plate in an aerosol-tight bucket at 1,000 × g for 90 min. After the spinoculation, transfer the plate to an incubator. Notes: For an optional second spinoculation, carefully remove 100 µL per well of supernatant, defrost new 100 µL aliquots of virus, add fresh pre-diluted polybrene, add the mix to cells, and centrifuge again.   For adherent cells, the addition of polybrene and the spinoculation may be omitted.  Remove the virus 6–24 h after the last spinoculation. Centrifuge the plate (300 × g, 5 min) and carefully remove most of the supernatant. Optionally wash cells with PBS before resuspending them in fresh growth medium.Culture the cells as usual. Note: Cells may show reduced growth and increased cell death for a few days post transduction.  After three days, determine the percentage of transduced cells per well by flow cytometry, e.g., via a fluorescent reporter protein such as GFP. After successful transduction, measure the percentage of GFP-positive cells per well every two to three days and split cultures as required.",
    "Note: In addition to monitoring GFP signal, the analysis can be extended to any other parameter that is accessible with flow-based measurements, such as differentiation, apoptosis, and cell cycle analysis to acquire deeper insights into the cellular effects of gene knockout.  The typical monitoring time is two to four weeks post transduction but will depend on the growth characteristics of the target cell line and the effect of the knockout. We recommend transferring the cells to 24-well plates for culturing and monitoring the percentage of GFP-positive cells. Cultures can be efficiently split using a 12-channel pipette using every second tip only. During each splitting event, transfer an aliquot of cells to a 96-well plate and analyze on the IQue Screener Plus flow cytometer or a similar device. Notes:   Transduction rates between 20%–80% are recommended; the optimum is 50%.   Test the procedure with only a few constructs (e.g., a set of controls) and adjust if required.   Optional changes include:   Adjust concentration of Lenti-X cells (e.g., 1 × 104  –2 × 104  cells per well).   Adjust concentration of target cells (e.g., scale down to 1 × 105  cells per well).   Adjust dilutions of virus (dilute virus more or less to decrease or increase transduction rates, respectively).   Increase/decrease number of spinoculations.   Scale up to a 24-well format for transfection and/or transduction.   In general, every flow cytometer equipped with the required laser and detector system to measure the reporter protein can be used for monitoring the percentage of transduced cells. We recommend a device with a plate loader module to most efficiently analyze high numbers of samples that are usually present in an arrayed CRISPR/Cas9 screen.",
    "Analysis of the competition assay  In the Forecyt software of the IQue Screener Plus, use the gating strategy shown in Figure 7 to identify the number of transduced cells as “percentage of GFP-positive cells of singlets.”imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4577/bioprotoc-12-24-4577-g007.jpg Figure 7. Gating strategy for identifying GFP-positive cells as the percentage of all live singlets per well  Generate a heat map of each measurement plate with GFP-positive cells as percentage of all singlet cells for each well. These values can be exported via the metrics function in a .csv format and further analyzed in Microsoft Excel.In Microsoft Excel, normalize all data to the first measurement, e.g., at day 3 post-transduction (Day3pt) and to a negative control (sgAAVS1). Note: It can happen that the percentage of GFP-positive cells still rises after Day3pt. If this is the case, normalize to a later time point, e.g., Day5pt or Day7pt.

Targeting a gene essential for cell proliferation will result in a decrease of the percentage of GFP-positive cells over time. Targeting of a non-essential gene will result in unchanged percentages of GFP-positive cells.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4577/bioprotoc-12-24-4577-g008.jpg Figure 8.
