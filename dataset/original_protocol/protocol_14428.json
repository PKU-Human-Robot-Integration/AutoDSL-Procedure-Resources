    "1. Sample preparation\nNOTE: Successive steps for preparing the samples are described in Figure 1.\nPlant sample preparation\n\t\nFrom wood trunks or fragments, cut 1 cm long samples with razor blades without damaging their structure.\nEmbed samples in polyethylene glycol (PEG) medium, by dipping them in successive solutions of increasing PEG concentration diluted in water until reaching 100% PEG.\n\t\t\nPlace sample under vacuum to remove water.\nGently stir samples in 30% v/v PEG for 24 h.\nGently stir samples in 50% v/v PEG for 24 h.\nGently stir samples in 100% PEG for 24 h at 70 °C (pure PEG is solid at room temperature).\nPlace samples in capsules at 70 °C (on a hot plate) and progressively decrease temperature until reaching room temperature.\nPrepare carefully 30-60 µm thickness flat sections from these PEG blocks using a microtome and disposables blades.\nCollect and wash sections in three successive baths of water for 5 min to remove PEG from the sections.\nFluorescent probe preparation\n\t\nPrepare buffer solution of 30 mM phosphate at pH 6.0.\nWeigh PEG rhand dextran rhodamine probe powder.\nDissolve probe powder into the buffer with continuous stirring in a glass vial for 1 h in the dark at a final concentration of 0.1 g/L.\nPlant sample staining\n\t\nIncubate sections with 500 µL of the fluorescent probe (see 1.2.3) for 72 h (no stirring) in a plastic tube (no more than 3 sections per tube) in the dark.\nPick-up a section with a brush, adsorb the buffer with a clean sheet (avoid drying the section), and then mount the incubated sections between a cover glass and a #1.5H coverslip.\n2. Fluorescence lifetime and spectral measurement system calibration\nNOTE: The complete workflow for sFLIM measurement is presented in Figure 2.\nDetermine the spectral window width of the sFLIM detector.",
    "Put urea crystals in a culture box with a 0.17 µm glass bottom.\nPlace the culture box on a microscope sample holder and select the 20x objective.\nSelect a Ti:Sa laser with a 900 nm wavelength and 2% power, and turn on the scanning.\nCollect the second harmonic signal on the sFLIM detector.\n\t\tNOTE: The second harmonic signal is emitted at exactly half excitation wavelength of 450 nm; while instantaneous, this measure also provides the instrumental response function of the system.\nGradually adjust the laser excitation wavelength from 900 to 980 nm until the second harmonic signal is collected in the second spectral channel (462.5 nm).\nDetermine the spectral window length (12.5 nm).\nIf the spectral range differs from what is expected, troubleshoot by doing the following.\n\t\t\nAdjust the laser to 910 nm.\nMove the grating position with a scroll wheel to measure the second harmonic signal on the first channel only (first channel boundary).\nAdjust the laser to 935 nm.\nMove the grating position with a scroll wheel to measure the second harmonic signal on the first channel only (second channel boundary).\nCalibration of the overall spectrometer channels\n\t\nInsert the mirror on the microscope stage.\nSelect the visible continuous laser (458 nm, 1% power).\nCollect the reflection signal on the sFLIM detector and check if photons are measured in the appropriate spectral channel.\nRepeat step 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 with all available continuous lasers (514 nm, 561 nm and 633 nm).\nIf the spectral channel differs from what is expected, move the grating position with the scroll wheel and repeat steps 2.1 and 2.2.\n3. Sample fluorescence characterization\nIn a spectrofluorometer equipped with a film holder accessory (e.g., Jasco FP-8500 instrument), place the plant section sample (not incubated with the fluorescent probe).",
    "Measure fluorescence emission typically on the range 300-600 nm while exciting the sample typically on the range 250-550 nm.\nPlot the fluorescence intensity versus excitation and emission wavelengths to draw a 3D fluorescence map.\nDetermine the maximum excitation/emission area from the plot.\n4. Spectral FRET measurement\nAutofluorescence calibration\n\t\nSelect the objective 20x (NA: 0.8).\nSet the two-photon laser excitation at 750 nm.\nPlace the wheat straw (WS) alone plant section between the slide and the coverslip.\nApply the following parameters in the software. Switch to lambda mode. Select the spectral detector ChS with a 9.7 nm resolution. Select the spectral range between 420 to 722 nm.\nAcquire the image.\nDetermine the donor emission peak (470 nm with this setup).\nAcceptor's calibration\n\t\nPlace rhodamine-based fluorescent probes in a culture box with a 0.17 µm glass bottom.\nAcquire the image with the same setting.\nDetermine the acceptor emission peak (570 nm with this setup).\nDetermine the spectral range with the maximum \"WS alone\" signal and no acceptor signal as the donor only emission for sFLIM measurements (460-490 nm with this setup).\nSample measurement\n\t\nPlace the stained plant section between the slide and the coverslip.\nAcquire the image with the same setting.\nSave the lsm file.\nQualitatively associate a strong FRET event with a decrease in donor emission peak compared to the \"WS alone sample\" and an increase in the acceptor emission peak compared to the rhodamine sample.\n5. sFLIM measurements\nNOTE: For the sFLIM setup, the system used is a time domain sFLIM setup as described previously10. An upright microscope and various time correlated single photon counting cards and confocal microscope manufacturers can be used and the protocol should be adapted accordingly.\nSwitch the system to sFLIM mode.\n\t\nSet the confocal microscope as described in 4.1.1 and 4.1.2.",
    "Switch to the Non-Descanned mode in the software to send fluorescent photons to the sFLIM detector.\nSet the sFLIM acquisition to the Enable mode to allow photon counting on the SPC150.\nSelect 30 s time collection on SPC150.\nCheck that the CFD is between 1 x 105 and 1 x 106.\n\t\tCAUTION: Ensure that the number of photons measured on the TCSPC card is always less than 1% of the laser excitation frequency (in this setup, the laser excitation frequency is 80 Mhz and detection rate cannot exceed 800 kHz in any pixel to avoid a pile up effect11).\nPlace the \"WS alone\" plant section between the slide and the coverslip.\n\t\nSet the software to Continuous mode to allow the laser scan.\nChoose the measurement area on the sample.\nClick Start on the SPC150.\nSave the sdt file.\nRepeat the process for at least 10 samples per condition.\nPlace the stained plant section between the slide and the coverslip.\n\t\nRepeat steps 5.2.1 - 5.2.5.\n6. sFLIM analysis\nSelect sFLIM data acquired file on \"WS alone\" and import them to the SPCImage software using File | Import.\nSelect fit parameters.\n\t\nFrom Option | Model, select Incomplete multi-exponentials: 12.5 ns.\nFrom Option | Preferences, select Calculate Instrumental Response automatically.\nFrom main panel's right menu, select the 2 exponential fit model:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59925/59925equ01.jpg\nFor each channel, apply the fitting model and save the fit parameters to a spreadsheet (a1, a2, t1, t2).\nFor comparison between channels and experiments, calculate the mean fluorescence lifetime in a spreadsheet (Tm):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59925/59925equ02.jpg\nCalculate the mean lifetime for all samples (at least 10) in all channels.",
    "Analyze Tm on donor channels (from channel 1 to 3: 460-490 nm) and determine the dedicated channel (Channel 2 corresponding to 467.5 - 480 nm) that shows the highest photon number and corresponds to lignin maximum emission. Values from channel 2 must be used in step 6.7.\nSelect sFLIM data acquired file on stained WS and import them to the SPCImage software.\n\t\nRepeat steps 6.1-6.4.\nCalculate the FRET efficiency EFRET for the donor in the previous selected channel WS Alone (TmD) and from stained plant sample (TmDA):\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/59925/59925equ03.jpg\nCompare sFLIM and EFRET values between the WS and the sample.\n\t\nConsider a positive EFRET associated with a homogeneous lifetime decrease between WS and the sample to be analyzed as a FRET event (see representative results and works by Spriet et al.12 and Terryn et al.10 for details).\nConsider a lifetime decrease distributed differently to be due to a mix of FRET and lignin compaction level and do not interpret as molecular interactions.\nConsider no lifetime modification as an absence of measurable FRET signal, but not as a lack of interaction with lignin"
