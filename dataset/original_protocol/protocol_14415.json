    "Animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and was conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th Edition, 2011). Mice were euthanized by methods compliant with the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) Guidelines for Euthanasia of Animals (2013 Edition). C57BL/6J, male, 8 - 16 week old mice were used in this protocol. Mice were housed in a 12 h dark/light cycle environment.\n1. Pre-operative Preparation\nTransfer mice to a clean cage 24 h before the procedure. Allow animals free access to water. Replace chow food with soft food (gel dietary supplement) 4 - 6 h before the surgery to reduce the contents of the small intestine for surgery.\nSterilize all surgical instruments and prepare the single-use sterile surgical materials. Clean the surgery area and the anesthetic nose cone with 70% ethanol.\nSet up a dissection microscope, isoflurane anesthetic vaporizer, instruments, and a temperature-controlled small animal surgical table for body temperature maintenance. Organize instruments, sutures, and syringes in a location for free access during the surgery.\nSet up a light source to provide enough light for the surgical area.\nPrepare sterile 0.9% saline in 5 mL syringe for intestinal and abdominal cleaning.\n2. Ileectomy and Anastomosis\nAnesthetize mice with isoflurane (2 - 3%) in a small animal incubation chamber. Determine adequate anesthetization using the toe pinch technique while the animal is on isoflurane.",
    "Remove abdominal hair by applying hair removal product and wipe hair away using surgical sponges while maintaining anesthesia. Place the mouse on a temperature-controlled small animal surgical table (Figure 1A) to maintain body temperature at 37 Â°C. Maintain anesthesia with isoflurane (1 - 2%) through a facemask. Treat the mouse eyes with ocular ointment.\nClean the skin using povidone-iodine and 70% alcohol and cover the surgical area of the abdomen with sterile surgical gauze (Figure 1B).\nMake a midline abdominal incision using a surgical scalpel once anesthesia is in effect. Use a cotton-tipped applicator to protect the intestine and pull mouse abdominal muscle with retractors to fully open and expose the abdominal cavity (Figure 1C).\nLocate the cecum. Starting from the cecum, carefully move the connected ileum and part of the jejunum out of abdominal cavity (Figure 1D).\n\tNOTE: The cecum can be easily identified due to its large size even after fasting.\nLigate the upper branch of the superior mesenteric artery with a 7-0 silk suture to occlude the blood supplying the ileal segment that is to be excised. The ileal color changes from pink to dark purple after ligation. (Figure 1E - F).\nDepending on the purpose of the experiment, using scissors, excise and remove 50% or 90% of ileum.\n\tNOTE: For sham surgery, do not perform the superior mesenteric artery ligation and do not remove the ileum.\nFlush the lumen of both ileal ends with 0.9% saline.\n\tNOTE: As the remaining intact ileum is still receiving a normal blood supply from the superior mesenteric artery, a small amount of blood will be flushed out during the process. This also indicates that the blood supply to the ileal ends is normal and ensures no ischemia during the anastomosis procedure (Figure 1G).",
    "Locate the mesenteries on the side of both ileal ends. Align the mesenteries and suture the ileal ends together using 8-0 suture (Figure 1G - H).\nSuture the contralateral side of the ileum to keep the ileum anastomosed in a natural manner (Figure 1I).\nSuture the upper and lower sides between the two original sutures to thoroughly join the two ileal ends together (Figure 1J).\nConfirm that there is no leakage from the anastomosis site after finishing the three-step suturing procedure (Figure 1G-I). Return the cecum and the small intestine into the abdominal cavity to the original anatomical location. Wash the surgery area with warm 0.9% saline using a blunt needle. (Figure 1K).\nClose the incision of the abdominal muscle layer with 6-0 suture. Align the abdominal skin incision using forceps and suture the abdominal skin to facilitate optimal wound healing (Figure 1L).\n3. Post-operative Care\nTransfer the post-surgery mice to an intensive care unit for recovery. House them in a paper-bedding cage on a temperature-controlled heating pad to continue the post-surgery recovery overnight. Supply mice with soft food in addition to regular food and water.\nAdministrate buprenorphine (0.05 - 0.1 mg/kg) with subcutaneous injection every 8-12 h for analgesia.\n\tNOTE: Euthanize mice by CO2 if severely sick.\nAt the end-point, sacrifice mice using overdosed isoflurane and harvest samples as needed (section 4).\n4. Evaluation of Ileectomy-induced Bile Overaccumulation\nWeigh and dissect the mice one day after a resection of 0% (sham), 50%, or 90% of ileum.\nRemove the GI tract and weigh it. Calculate the GI weight to body weight ratio to evaluate the severity of bile salt malabsorption and overaccumulation.",
    "Transfer the GI tracts into 15 mL conical tubes and cut them into short segments using scissors. After cutting, centrifuge at 3,000 x g for 10 min. Transfer the supernatant (GI fluid containing bile salts) to a clean tube.\nMeasure the total volume and weight of GI fluid and calculate the fluid weight to GI tract weight ratio to further assess bile overaccumulation in the GI tract.\nDetermine the total bile amount in the supernatant by bile acid assay as described in reference 8.\nSubscription Required.
