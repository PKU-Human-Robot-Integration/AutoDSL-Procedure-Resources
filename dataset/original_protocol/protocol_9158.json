    "All methods described here have been approved by the Northwestern University Institutional Review Board (IRB protocol#: STU00104680). An overall workflow of the protocol is illustrated in Figure 1.\n1. Bioinformatic Analysis of Donor and Recipient HLA Sequences\nRetrieve sequences from IMGT/HLA database15.\n\t\nObtain HLA typing reports of both the organ donor and his/her recipient.\n\t\tNOTE: Ensure proper procedures to protect confidential medical records are utilized. Typically, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval of the study protocol or the experimental test is required per institutional IRB guidelines. If HLA reports were from PCR-based typing (of either high or low resolution) or sequencing-based typing (SBT), go directly to step 1.1.3. If sequences were obtained from genomic/HLA sequencing, and if they are complete, use these sequences directly instead. Occasionally, when only incomplete typing or sequencing results are available, follow the additional step 1.1.2. to assign the \"missing\" alleles via the web tool described in step 1.1.2.\nOpen the Ambiguous Allele Combinations following web link - http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/ambig.html, and search using the “Ambiguous Allele Combinations Search Tool” function to retrieve the hypothetical alleles. Then, proceed to step 1.1.3. to enter the allele name.\nOpen the IMGT/HLA Allele Query Form at the following the web link - http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ipd/imgt/hla/allele.html, and input subject’s allele names (each individually, as shown in Figure 2) into the “Search for” box. Click on the “Search for alleles now” button. HLA allele names should use standard naming systems (i.e., A*, A*01, A*01:01:01:01, and any previous designations like A*01010101).\nFind the matching allele name displayed on the screen. Click on the allele button.\nCopy the \"Protein sequence\", and paste it into a text document underneath a header line of \">allele name\". Effectively, the text document is in a FASTA (FAST-All) format of the allele name and sequence.",
    "Perform gene-based multiple alignments of donor and recipient/patient alleles.\nOne gene (i.e., DQB1*03:01:01:01) at a time, copy and paste all four alleles of the donor and patient FASTA sequences (two from the donor and two from the patient) into a combined text document. At this point, it is important to differentially denote donor allele names from patient allele names (Options include differential use of upper vs. lower cases; or create a distinguishing prefix or suffix extension to each allele name to separately mark donor vs. patient alleles). The input order of the sequences is not important because following alignment the order will be shuffled according to the levels of similarity between any pair of sequences.\nCopy and paste the sequences in FASTA format (as seen in Figure 3) from above into the “Enter your input sequences” box on the Cluster Omega website: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/.\nClick on \"Submit your job\" using standard settings of parameters: such as \"PROTEIN\"; and \"Clustal w/ numbers\". Perform alignment by clicking on \"Submit\". An alignment of the four sequences is displayed on the screen (Figure 4).\nMark donor-specific mismatches.\n\tNOTE: It should be specially noted that the allelic sequences given here were based on the results of HLA typing, not sequencing. Therefore, there is a risk that relevant sequence variation in the particular donor-recipient pair may be missed. This potential problem will be mitigated as more and more transplant centers adopt accurate high-resolution typing and direct DNA sequencing.\n\t\nCopy and paste the alignment text into a text document and create a new document. If the format of the aligned file is disturbed, fix the format by changing font style and size: Always use \"Courier New\" font in small type size to fit the rows. Save the document after the formatting issues are solved.",
    "Manually inspect the aligned sequences to identify all mismatched residues that belong uniquely to the donor. Mark each of these donor-specific residues using a distinguishing font color.\nUnderline all letters in the donor's sequences that extend 14 residues both up- and downstream of the marked donor-specific mismatches (calculated as 15 amino acid peptide minus 1 residue of the mismatch).\nDerive 15-mer peptide sequences in an overlapping series.\n\tNOTE: The reason for choosing 15-mer peptides was based on the general knowledge of typical epitopes being 4-9 amino acids in length. Therefore, when we applied a \"moving window\" procedure with a step size of 4 amino acids ( Figure 1), our selection of a 15 amino acid length left a 15-4=11 amino acid overlap between any neighboring peptides in a series. In theory, this 11 amino acid overlap is sufficient to cover all immune epitopes of up to 9 amino acids in length, so that no epitope will be inadvertently \"split\" in half with only partial sequences on the array.\n\t\nUse the underlined sequences as templates to sequentially derive short 15 amino acid sequences in a series that overlap by 4 residues between any two immediately adjacent sequences in the series.\nCopy and paste these 15 amino acid sequences into a spreadsheet( Figure 5) in a column format accompanied by notation columns that include the corresponding names of the donor alleles. An additional column to include aa residue positions may be useful.\nRepeat the steps from 1.1.3. to 1.3. for each HLA allele (i.e., A, B, C, DQA1, DQB1, DRB1 and DP) of the donor and the recipient pair to derive the 15 aa short sequences of the donor.",
    "Copy and paste all columns into a master spreadsheet to create a long continuous column of all the 15 aa sequences from all the alleles of the donor. Write down the total number of rows (for the peptide sequences) in the document.\n2. Design of Custom Array Layout and Production\nGenerate a spreadsheet of peptide sequences with corresponding allele callings.The array has 20 rows and 30 columns and can hold up to 20x30=600 spots for peptides. Depending on the total number of peptides recorded in step 1.5 from one particular donor, and based our past experience with two examples that we had tried in Liu et al.17, the 600 spot array can hold all the sequences generated from ~2 separate transplant cases.\n\t\nRationally plan the most efficient way to fit the sets of peptides within the 600-spot format of the array.\nIf more than one subject can fit into one whole array, insert empty rows after the first donor's sequences to match the total number of rows that can be divided by 30 (the number of spots in a row on the array).\nImmediately following the last empty row for the first set of sequences, paste in the entire column of sequence contents from the second transplant case.\nRepeat these steps until the array is filled and no more cases can be added without exceeding the 600 spots. If entire empty rows are left to fill at the bottom, \"move\" the empty row to be positioned between the two donor sets. This wide space left between cases makes cutting of the membrane after completion of the synthesis easier - following step 3.2. below.",
    "Program the peptide sequences in the context of array layout. The program of the SPOT synthesizer takes a text format of the sequences (one row one peptide sequence), which can be directly obtained by saving the resulting spreadsheet from step 2.1.4 as a simple text document (without the extra column(s) for allele names, aa positions etc.).\nRun automated peptide array synthesis via the SPOT synthesizer. The entire operation of the synthesis is detailed in Kudithipudi et al.21. Note that Fmoc synthesis of two arrays takes ~4-5 days.\n3. Probe and Reprobe Antisera from a Time Series of an Individual Transplant Recipient.\nNOTE: The 600-spot membrane array has the dimensions ~7 cm x 13 cm. After synthesis, the arrays can be stored at room temperature as dry membranes for at least two years when shielded from direct light. Avoid excessive folding of the membrane to preserve its longevity for repeated use.\nRehydrate the membrane array with ethanol and visualize peptide spots stained with Ponceau S.\nRehydrate the membrane array carrying the peptides following a stepwise procedure optimized in Li et al.24.\n\t\t\nImmerse the array membrane in 20 mL of 100% ethanol.\nAdd 20 mL distilled water to dilute the solution to 50% ethanol and incubate at room temperature for 15 min.\nChange the immersion solution to 40 mL of 100% water three times and incubate 15 min each time.\nWash in a proper working buffer, e.g., 20 mL of TBST (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1%), three times for 5 min each.\nPonceau S staining of the array to visualize synthetic peptides\n\t\t\nAdd 20 mL of pre-formulated Ponceau S solution directly to the hydrated array and incubate for ~30 s with shaking.",
    "Run distilled water continuously over the membrane to de-stain background Ponceau S color. During the process, peptide spots of red color may become visible.\nSeparate the portions of the array for each donor by carefully cutting between the sections of the array for individual cases. Mark the orientation of each array.\nPre-block array.\nBlock the membrane in 20 mL of 5% non-fat milk dissolved in TBST buffer. This milk-based solution will further de-stain Ponceau S color. Replace the milk buffer several times in order to achieve the clearest peptide images.\nFor record-keeping purposes, take a photo of the Ponceau S image of the array using a hand-held camera (example in Figure 6).\nContinue blocking of the membrane in 5% non-fat milk at 4 °C overnight or at room temperature for 2 h with rocking.\nIncubate array with transplant antiserum.\n\tNOTE: It should be noted that a phenomenon known as prozone or the Hook effect may result from complement-dependent interference in serum antibody analysis. To circumvent this problem, an optional serum pretreatment step can be considered with either EDTA or heat inactivation of serum samples.\n\t\nRemove blocking buffer and wash the membrane with 20 mL of TBST three times the next day for 5 min each time.",
    "Add 20 µL of the crude serum of the recipient to 20 mL of 2.5% milk in TBST buffer and incubate with the membrane for 2-3 h at room temperature. Note that in this initial round of probing, it is recommended that the last post-transplant serum (or likely most sensitized serum) in the time series is firstly used. This is based on the assumption that earlier specimens in the series, particularly from pre-transplant time points, have less variety of alloantibodies that tend to develop over time. This way, any possibility of signal interference from \"carry-over\" between probing rounds can be clearly distinguished from truly developed alloantibody reactivity due to immune responses against the graft.\nWash the array using 20 mL of TBST and incubate with secondary antibody.\nWash the membrane three times for 10 min each time.\nIncubate with goat anti-human IgG-HRP (Horseradish peroxidase) secondary antibody at 1:10,000 dilution in TBST buffer supplemented with 1% milk for another 2 h.\nWash and develop the blot.\nWash the membrane three times with TBST for 10 min each time.\nPerform enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) using 5 mL of luminol solution freshly mixed with 5 mL of peroxide solution to develop the membrane (for 1 min).\nVisualize ECL signals using a suitable imager (i.e., ChemiDoc Imaging Systems or Azure C600).\nScan and quantify the blot.\nSave the developed images (Figure 7, lower image) and perform quantification of spot intensity.\n4. Compare Antiserum Reactivity across a Clinical Time Series.\nStrip the array.\nAt this point, keep the membrane wet at all times.",
    "Strip the membrane by incubating with 20 mL of commercial stripping buffer at 37 °C for 20 min, and then wash the membrane with TBST three times for 10 min each. Then repeat the blocking (step 4.2) and probing (step 4.3) steps using a different serum of the patient taken at a different time point.\nBlock stripped membrane.\n\tNote: Following stripping, the membrane can be reused for another round of probing of a different serum from the same patient in a time series.\n\t\nBlock the membrane using 5% milk buffer as before (see step 3.2).\nReprobe a different antiserum from the same time series (repeat steps from 3.3-3.6; example in Figure 7, upper image).\n\tNOTE: The stripped array can then be used to reprobe another serum specimen. Since the peptides are covalently conjugated to the supporting matrix of the membrane, we showed that the array can be reused for up to 20 rounds of stripping and reprobing cycles without losing its performance.\nLong-term storage of arrays.\nStore the membrane in TBS buffer supplemented with 0.02% w/w sodium azide as preservative. Use a sealed plastic bag for long-term storage. At 4 °C under protection from direct light, the wet membrane can be stored for at least 2 years.\n5. Data Acquisition and Analysis\nManually annotate positive antigen peptides.\n\t\nLocate spots showing positive antibody signals and determine each of their grid positions.\nHighlight the corresponding rows in the master worksheet for the positive peptides.\nRetrieve peptide sequences listed in the master worksheet ( Figure 7, bottom list). According to the design principle outlined in step 1.4.1., neighboring serial spots share significantly overlapping sequences (15-4=11), therefore reactive epitopes may be shared by peptides in a consecutive series.\n\t\nHighlight any positive spots occurring in succession.",
    "Determine minimum epitope length for each peptide in a series.\n\t\nHighlight any potentially shared epitope sequences based on overlapping segments of reactive peptides.\nStructurally model antigen epitopes.\nObtain prototype HLA crystal structures from the Protein Data Bank found at the following the web link: http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do.\nDisplay the prototype HLA structure in Pymol (download from www.pymol.org).\nMap\" or model discovered anti-donor epitopes to the 3D structures of the prototype HLA molecules by highlighting the reactive peptide sequences ( Figure 8). Click on \"Display\", then \"Background\", and select \"White\". To save the image, go to \"File\" and \"Save Image As\" and select the file format \"png\".\nReport results and assign reactive epitopes to the corresponding alleles.\nCompare array results to the single-antigen beads (SAB) results, if available.\n\tNOTE: The SAB test using single allelic antigens measures antibody reactivity towards a fixed panel of HLA proteins. Individual peptides that show antibody reactivity belong to certain HLA alleles that, if also included in the SAB panel, allow direct comparison between the array and the SAB results. Our previous study17 showed a high level of correlation between the results, suggesting that the peptide epitopes significantly contribute to the overall reactivity of SAB. In addition, the array results also reveal amino acid-levels of specificity.\n\t\nObtain SAB results from an HLA lab which provides information about whether and which donor alleles are reactive to post-transplant sera of the patient. Results from step 5.5. based on the array analysis also provide information about corresponding donor alleles positive for alloantibody reactivity.\nCompare SAB and array results.\nSubscription Required.
