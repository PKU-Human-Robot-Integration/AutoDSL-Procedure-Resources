    "NOTE: A schematic workflow of the illustrated protocol is shown in Figure 2.\n1. Design of φC31 attB -tagged plasmids (Figure 3)\nCreate attB donor plasmids carrying the following essential components\n\t\nDominant fluorescent marker\n\t\t\nChoose a promoter to drive the expression of the fluorescent marker.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: For Anopheles transgenesis, fluorescent markers are usually under the regulation of the 3xP3 promoter39, which drives expression in the eyes and nerve cord. Alternatively, the PUBc promoter5 can be used when expression in multiple tissues is desired. Donor plasmids and docking lines used as examples in this protocol are marked using the 3xP3 promoter.\nChoose a fluorescent protein (FP) that is compatible with that of the receiving docking line so that they are readily distinguishable.\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Do not use the same marker that is already present in the docking line and avoid the simultaneous use of GFP (green)/YFP (yellow) and GFP (green)/CFP (cyan) as they are very difficult to reliably differentiate. Donor plasmids used as examples in this protocol are marked with either DsRed or YFP as they are to be integrated in a docking line marked with CFP.\nattB recombination site(s)\n\t\t\nUse a single attB site for integration of a transgenic cassette (single-attB design) (Figure 3A).\nUse two inverted attB sites for RMCE (double-attB design) where the sites lay inverted in respect to one another and enclose the donor DNA template (Figure 3B).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The orientation of the attB site(s) must be compatible with that of the attP site(s) present in the docking line.\nDesired transgene cargo",
    "Use any other desired features to be integrated in the mosquito genome based on the specific purpose of the experiment. Here, we describe the integration of an antimalarial effector molecule into the genome of An. stephensi and the integration of the components of the GAL4/UAS system into An. gambiae mosquitoes.\nPlasmid backbone components\n\t\t\nInclude, amongst other essential components for plasmid replication in bacteria, a marker for plasmid selection in vitro (i.e., an antibiotic resistance gene).\n\t\t\tNOTE: The plasmid backbone will be integrated in the mosquito genome in the single-attB design for integration (Figure 3A), while it will not be inserted in the double-attB design for RMCE (Figure 3B).\n2. Preparation of plasmids for the microinjection mix\nNOTE: The protocol illustrated here involves the use of two plasmids: an attB-tagged donor plasmid carrying the transgene of interest, and a helper plasmid that expresses the φC31 integrase under the regulation of the Drosophila Hsp70 promoter40.\nPurify donor and helper plasmids using an endotoxin-free plasmid purification kit.\n\tNOTE: Sequence the final plasmid preparation used for injection to verify the integrity of all components.\nCombine appropriate amounts of the two plasmids to obtain a mix with a final concentration of 350 ng/µL of the donor plasmid and 150 ng/µL of the helper plasmid when resuspended in injection buffer.\n\tNOTE: When calculating the necessary volume of mix, consider that 10-15 µL are sufficient for each day of planned injections and DNA can be prepared in advance and stored at -20 °C. Integrase helper plasmid concentrations of 60-500 ng/µL and donor plasmid concentrations of 85-200 ng/µL have also been reported21,22,26,41.",
    "Precipitate the DNA by adding 0.1 volumes of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2.5 volumes of ice-cold 100% EtOH and vortex. A white precipitate should be immediately visible. Having highly concentrated initial plasmid preparations (i.e., ~1 µg/µL) improves precipitation efficiency.\n\tNOTE: Stopping point - The precipitate can be stored at -20 °C overnight.\nCentrifuge at 15,000 x g for 20 min at 4 °C, discard the supernatant, and wash the pellet with 1 mL of ice-cold 70% EtOH.\nWash the pellet with 1 mL of ice-cold 70% EtOH and centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 5 min at room temperature.\nDiscard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet and air dry.\nResuspend the pellet in 1x injection buffer (0.1 mM Na3PO4, 5 mM KCl, pH 7.2, 0.22 µm filter sterilized) to reach a total final concentration of 500 ng/µL.\n\tNOTE: Assume that some DNA will be lost during the precipitation process; therefore, add a smaller volume of injection buffer first, check the concentration on a spectrophotometer (e.g., Nanodrop), and then add an appropriate remaining volume to reach 500 ng/µL.\nEnsure that the DNA is thoroughly resuspended, prepare aliquots of 10-15 µL each and store them at -20 °C.\nOn the day of injection, thaw one aliquot and centrifuge at 15,000 x g for 5 min to remove any particulate residues.\n\t​NOTE: An alternative method for particulate removal is to filter the solution through a 0.22 µm filter. Avoid the presence of particulate residues in the injection mix as they lead to needle blockage during embryo microinjection.\n3. Microinjection of embryos from an Anopheles docking line",
    "Blood feed 4-7-day-old mosquitoes from the desired docking line 72 h prior to microinjection (i.e., for injection on Monday and Tuesday feed females on the previous Friday; for injection on Thursday and Friday feed females on Monday of the same week).\nBlood feed wild-type (WT) mosquitoes (i.e., mosquitoes with the same genomic background of the docking line) on the same day; these will be needed for outcrossing.\n\tNOTE: The size and quality of the blood meal affect egg quality, so it is recommended to always use fresh blood (i.e., blood drawn within the previous 7 days). Arm feeding or feeding on mice may increase the quality and quantity of eggs, however these methods are not encouraged. Specific approved protocols will be necessary for human and animal use.\nPerform embryo microinjections\n\t\nPerform An. gambiae embryo microinjections in 25 mM NaCl42 by targeting the posterior pole of the embryo at a 45-degree angle. For a detailed protocol for embryo collection, alignment, and microinjection refer to Pondeville et al.43 and Lobo et al.44.\nPerform An. stephensi embryo microinjections in halocarbon oil 700:27 (2:1) by targeting the posterior pole of the embryo at a 30-degree angle. A detailed protocol for embryo collection, alignment, and microinjection can be found in Terenius et al.45 and Lobo et al.44.\nTransfer eggs immediately after injection in a Petri dish filled with sterile distilled water (pH 7.2) and return them to insectary conditions.\nUpon hatching, transfer G0 larvae into a tray with salted distilled water (0.1% tonic salt) daily and rear to pupae.\nRecord hatching rate (i.e., number of larvae hatched/number of embryos injected).",
    "​NOTE: Embryo movement aids hatching, so gentle swirling is desirable. Hatching should start ~48 h after injection. Since injection may cause a slight developmental delay it is advisable to keep monitoring for late-hatching larvae for 3-4 days.\n4. Crossing and screening of transformed individuals\n[OPTIONAL STEP] Screen G0 (injected) 1st or 2nd instar larvae (L1-L2) for transient expression of the fluorescent marker.\n\t\nUse a fine-tip glass pipette to transfer G0 L1-L2 larvae to a microscope slides with wells. Place one larva in each well.\nUse a fluorescence stereoscope with the appropriate filter to screen for the presence of transient expression of the fluorescent marker.\n\t\tNOTE: The pattern of transient expression is dictated by the promoter used. When using the 3xP3 promoter, transient expression of the fluorescent marker is visible in the anal papillae (see Figure 6 in Pondeville et al.43)\nRear G0 positive individuals separately.\nSort G0 pupae by sex under a stereoscope52.\nLet males emerge in separate cages in groups of 3-5 (founder families) and add a 10-fold excess of age-matched WT females.\n\tNOTE: Since males mate multiple times, it is important to provide an excess of WT females to maximize the mating chances of each male.\nLet females emerge in separate cages in groups of 10-15 (founder families) and add an equal number of age-matched WT males.\n\tNOTE: If there is limited space in the insectary, females can emerge all together in a single cage. The female to male ratio can be as low as 1 male to 3 females.\nAllow adults to mate for 4-5 days and provide females with a blood meal.\n\t​NOTE: Blood feed and collect eggs from G0 females multiple times to maximize the chances of getting transformants from multiple gonotrophic cycles.\nBlood feed WT individuals at the same time for outcrossing.",
    "Collect eggs and rear emerging next generation G1s.\nScreen G1 L3-L4 larvae for appropriate fluorescence to identify transformants.\n\t\nCollect larvae in a Petri dish lined with filter paper or on a microscope slide and screen using a fluorescent stereoscope with appropriate filters for the presence of the marker introduced with the attB-tagged cargo.\n\t\t​NOTE: Fluorescence driven by the 3xP3 promoter is visible in all postembryonic stages and the screening may be performed on younger larvae, however these are more fragile and must be handled relatively carefully. Pupae can also be screened.\n\t\t\nFor single-attB designs for integration screen for the presence of the new and pre-existing marker; they should both be present since the new cassette is inserted next to the original one (Figure 3A, Figure 4).\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Screening exception for single attB designs: When using marker-less docking lines22, screen for the presence of the new marker only. When using docking lines where integration results in the inactivation of the pre-existing marker21, screen for the presence of the new marker and the loss of the pre-existing one.\nFor double-attB designs for RMCE, screen for the presence of the new marker and the loss of the pre-existing one, only the newly introduced marker should be present since the new cassette replaces the original one (Figure 3B, Figure 5).\n\t\t\t​NOTE: Occasional integration events can be recovered in RMCE experiments where only a single attP recombined and thus both markers will be present. The screening of G1 individuals can be carried out also at the pupa stage following the same procedure52.\nTransfer transformed G1 individuals into a larval tray and rear to pupae. Discard non-fluorescent individuals and individuals with an unexpected marker expression pattern.\nSort transformed G1 pupae by sex and cross them en masse with opposite-sex age-matched WT individuals.",
    "Allow adults to mate for 4-5 days, provide a blood meal, collect the eggs, and rear the next generation G2 progeny.\n\t\nFor single integration experiments, collect eggs directly from the en masse cross as the integration site is identical in all individuals.\nFor RMCE experiments, collect eggs from single females and maintain progeny separate until molecular assessment is complete due to the potential presence of two alternative cassette orientations (Figure 3B).\nScreen the G2 progeny (at either the larva or pupa stage) for the presence of the fluorescent marker (50% of the individuals are expected to be positive), discard non-fluorescent progeny.\nSet aside a subset of G2 positive individuals for molecular analysis, rear the rest to adulthood.\n\tNOTE: If all G2 individuals must be kept alive, molecular analysis can be conducted on single adult's legs46 or pupal case DNA extractions (L. Grigoraki personal communication). Alternatively, molecular analysis can be performed after all the G2 individuals have oviposited and eggs have hatched.\nAllow adult males and females to intercross in the same cage to establish the new transgenic line.\n\t​NOTE: For RMCE experiments, adult intercross must occur between siblings deriving from a single female until orientation of insertion is determined via molecular analysis.\n5. Molecular validation of the insertion site by DNA amplification (PCR)\nPrepare a map of the predicted insertion site in the genome of the docking line after transformation.\n\t\nSingle integration: Ensure that the predicted insertion site carries the original docking construct plus the whole sequence of the donor plasmid between the two hybrid sites attL and attR (Figure 3A).\nRMCE: Ensure that the predicted insertion site is identical to that of the docking line where hybrid inverted attL sites replace the original inverted attP sites and the exchange template replaces the cassette originally present between them (Figure 3B).",
    "Design oligonucleotide primers to amplify the insertional junction at either side of the integration locus.\n\t\nSingle integration: Design oligonucleotide primer pairs that span across the attR and/or attL sites. One primer must bind to the previously integrated docking construct and the other to the newly integrated transgene (Figure 3A).\nRMCE: Cassette replacement can occur in two different orientations with respect to the chromosome (designated A and B). Design alternative combinations of 4 oligonucleotide primers to give a discrete product in only one of the orientations, with one pair being diagnostic for orientation A, and the other for orientation B (Figure 3B, Figure 6).\nExtract genomic DNA from G2 positive individuals and perform the diagnostic PCR and gel electrophoresis to visualize the presence of expected diagnostic amplicons from the predicted integration site maps.\n\tNOTE: DNA may alternatively be extracted from single adult's legs46 or pupal cases (L. Grigoraki personal communication).\nSequence PCR products to confirm expected sequences.\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/62146/62146fig02.jpg\nFigure 2.
