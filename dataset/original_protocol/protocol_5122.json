    "Experimental preparationFor each experimental condition, plate 3T3-L1 adipocytes in 6 wells of a 24-well plate (~½ million cells/well) in DMEM/10% FBS. Note: 3T3-L1 fibroblast cells are differentiated in a 10 cm dish (~1 x 107 cells/dish) according to the protocol by Subtil et al. (2000). ~3.3 million cells are used per condition, day 5 or 6 post differentiation in DMEM/10% FBS (one 10 cm dish is sufficient for three conditions).After plating in a 24-well plate, allow cells to recover overnight in a 37 °C/5% CO2 incubator before proceeding to Procedure B.ER secretion assayNote: A work flow diagram of the ER secretion assay is shown in Figure 1.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20170326/20170326225922_3476.jpgFigure 1. Work flow diagram for ER secretion in adipocytes. A. Adipocytes are plated in 6 wells of a 24 well plate. B. Cells are treated with BFA for 45 min, BFA is washed out, and allowed to recover for various amounts of time in BFA-free media. Red numbers indicate points of media collection and cell solubilization from a well of the plate.Prepare 5 μg/ml Brefeldin A (BFA) in M-199 protein-free media warmed to 37 °C.Wash all cells three times with M-199 media. Following aspiration of the last wash, add 150 μl of 5 μg/ml BFA (in M-199 protein-free media) to each well. Incubate cells for 30 min at 37 °C/5% CO2. Upon BFA treatment the Golgi rapidly collapses and Golgi proteins undergo retrograde trafficking to the ER. Furthermore, BFA treatment inhibits anterograde trafficking from the ER to the Golgi, and consequently Golgi proteins accumulate in the ER (Fujiwara et al., 1988; Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989 and 1990). Thus, the majority of post-ER adipsin is redistributed back to the ER and the bulk of intracellular adipsin accumulates in the ER.",
    "BFA treatment serves as a way to synchronize cells to allow for accurate comparison of adipsin secretion across conditions.Collect media from well #1 in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Wash cells in well #1 one time with 1x PBS and add 100 μl of 1x LSB. Scrape cells and collect solubilized cells in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube. Set the media and solubilized cells aside on ice.Remove the media from wells #2-6 and add 150 μl of pre-warmed 5 μg/ml BFA (in M-199 protein-free media) for 15 min at 37 °C/5% CO2. This additional BFA treatment ensures that all post-ER adipsin has been cleared.Collect media and solubilize cells from well #2 as described in step B3.Wash wells #3-6 three times with M-199 media to washout the BFA. Add 150 μl of M-199 media (without BFA) to each well to allow for recovery.30 min post recovery, collect media and solubilize cells from well #3.60 min post recovery, collect media and solubilize cells from well #4.120 min post recovery, collect media and solubilize cells from well #5.180 min post recovery, collect media and solubilize cells from well #6.Boil solubilized cells collected from wells #1-6 at 95 °C for 5 min and store at -20 °C.Note: Samples can be set aside on ice until all samples have been collected, and boiled together once collection is complete.TCA protein precipitation of mediaAdd a 1:10 dilution of ice cold TCA to media collected from wells #1-6 (i.e., add 15 μl of TCA to 150 μl of media) and incubate on ice for 30 min.Spin samples in a microcentrifuge at 16,000 x g, 4 °C for 5 min.Discard the supernatant using a pipette tip.Note: The pellet will appear as a thin, clear smear on the side of the Eppendorf tube and can be difficult to observe.",
    "When discarding the supernatant, one should avoid touching the pipette tip against the side of the tube containing the pellet as to not disturb the pellet.Add 200 μl of cold acetone (cool at -20 °C beforehand) to the pellet and vortex.Spin samples in a microcentrifuge at 16,000 x g, 4 °C for 5 min to recollect the pellet.Wash samples once more with cold acetone (repeat steps C3-C5).Remove supernatant from the second acetone wash and air dry pellet at room temperature for two minutes, followed by placing samples in a 95 °C heat block for two minutes to ensure the acetone is fully evaporated. If residual acetone remains, samples can be left for additional time at 95 °C.Add 30 μl of 2x Laemmli sample buffer to each pellet and boil samples at 95 °C for 10 min. Store samples at -20 °C.Western blottingRun samples of TCA concentrated media and solubilized cells on a home-made 10% polyacrylamide gel (see Figures 2A and 2B).Note: If the cell lysates are viscous, samples can be passed through a 26 G ½ needle multiple times until less viscous.Transfer proteins to a nitrocellulose membrane, and block the blot in 5% milk/0.1% Tween-20/PBS for 1 h at room temperature.Probe blots for adipsin using an goat anti-adipsin antibody diluted 1:500 in 5% milk/0.1% Tween-20/PBS overnight at 4 °C.Wash blots 3 x 5 min with PBS/0.1% Tween-20 at room temperature. Incubate blots with HRP conjugated Donkey anti-Goat secondary antibody diluted 1:5,000 in 1% milk/0.1% Tween-20/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Wash blots 3 x 5 min with PBS/0.1% Tween-20 at room temperature.Develop blots using chemiluminescence detection system."
