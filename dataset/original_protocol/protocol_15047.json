    "1. Procedure\nOpen the software via the shortcut on your Windows desktop by double-clicking on the icon.\nClick Patient to activate the Patient Screen.\nTo enter a new patient into the database, click the New button in the patient search area, and then click on the Yes button to confirm you would like to enter a new patient.\nEnter patient details such as last name, first name, date of birth, and gender. Click on the Save button to advance to the next step.\nClick the PWA or PWV button to perform measurement. If only one of these modes is available, there is no need to click on the button, simply proceed to the study screen.\n2. Central Blood Pressure Measurement Using Pulse Wave Analysis (PWA)\nClick on the Study button to enter study parameters. Enter the brachial pressure taken from a calibrated sphygmomanometer and any other details you wish to include.\nClick on the Capture Data button to proceed with a measurement. Attach the three ECG electrodes and leads to the patient in a modified Lead II configuration or using the patient's limbs as indicated on the cables.\nPalpate the patient's radial artery. This is located on the lateral of the wrist, immediately above the wrist joint near the base of the thumb. Gently press the radial artery against the underlying bone with the middle and index fingers.\nPlace the tonometer over the strongest pulse point. Gently press the tonometer down until you see a consistent pressure waveform displayed on the data capture screen.\nIf Auto Capture is enabled (see Note below), the system will automatically save the measurement. To manually save the measurement for analysis, press the spacebar on your keyboard (or step on the footswitch, if used).",
    "If a repeat measurement is required with the same study parameters, click on the Repeat button to return to the Capture Data screen and repeat the measurement as outlined in steps 2.4-2.5 above.\nTo perform a measurement on a new patient, click on the Patient button and return to step 1.3 above.\n3. Arterial Stiffness Measurement Using Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV)\nClick on the Study button to enter study parameters.\nEnter brachial pressure taken from a calibrated sphygmomanometer\n\tEnter the distance measured for the distal (supra-sternal notch to femoral pulse) and proximal (supra-sternal notch to carotid pulse) sites. Medication, Notes, and Operator fields may be entered, if desired\nClick on the Capture button to proceed with the measurement.\nEnsure the ECG signal is of acceptable quality.\nPalpate the carotid artery pulse. This is located between the larynx and the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the neck. It can be felt by pushing the muscle to the side and pressing the artery against the larynx.\nPlace the tonometer on the carotid artery and gently press the tonometer down until you receive a consistent pressure waveform displayed on the data capture screen.\nWhen you have a minimum of 13 sec of consistent waveforms, click the OK button or (press on the footswitch, if used).\nPalpate the femoral artery pulse. This is located over the ventral thigh halfway between the pubic symphysis and anterior superior iliac spine.\nPlace the tonometer on the femoral artery and gently press the tonometer down until you receive a consistent pressure waveform displayed on the capture screen. When you have a minimum of 13 sec of consistent waveforms, click the OK button (or press the on the footswitch, if used).",
    "The report(s) can now be reviewed. These measurements are typically conducted in triplicate. If the user wishes to measure the PWV between carotid and radial arteries, these steps just shown would be repeated except that instead of measuring at the femoral artery, the user would place the tonometer at the radial artery. To perform a measurement on a new patient, click on the Study button and repeat this procedure or use the Search feature to search for an existing patient.\n4. Shut Down\nThe software automatically saves all reports. To close the software, click on System from the main menu, and then click on Exit. Place the tonometer in the module tray for storage.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
