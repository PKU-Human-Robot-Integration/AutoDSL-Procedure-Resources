    "All animal experiments are carried out in accordance with the guidelines of the ShanghaiTech University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, which fulfill the local and international requirements.\n1. Experimental Animals\nUse adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (~300-450 g) between 8-12 weeks old. At this age in the rats, the sperm have arrived in the cauda epididymides.\n2. Isolation of Epithelial Cells from Rat Cauda Epididymides\nNOTE: The following steps are performed under non-aseptic conditions unless otherwise stated.\nPreparation of dissection instruments and reagents\nDisinfect the dissection tools by immersion in 70% ethanol and let them air dry.\nTurn on the warming bath (32 °C); Prepare and pre-warm 500 mL of 1x Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 Medium (RPMI) supplemented with 1% (v/v) antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin final), and labeled as \"RPMI (+P/S 1:100)\". Perform this step in a clean air-flow controlled working station.\nPrepare and pre-warm 1x 500 mL Iscove's Modified Dulbecco's Medium (IMDM) containing non-essential amino acids (0.1 mM) and sodium pyruvate (1 mM), and supplemented with 5-α-dihydrotestosterone (1 nM), 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% (v/v) antibiotics (100 U/mL penicillin and 100 µg/mL streptomycin final), and labeled as \"Full-IMDM\". Create 50 mL aliquots and seal with parafilm; store at 4 °C. Use aseptic conditions.\nPrepare a collagenase enzyme digestion solution by dissolving collagenase Type I and collagenase Type II in RPMI (+P/S 1:100) resulting in 1 mg/mL of each collagenase in the solution. Filter through a 0.22-µm membrane and mark as \"Collagenase Solution\". Keep at room temperature (RT) until use. Adjust the volume of the enzyme solution based on the weight of the enzyme; the minimal volume required for both cauda epididymides from a single rat is 2 mL.\nFill a 35 mm dish with RPMI (+P/S 1:100).\nDissection of rat cauda epididymides",
    "Sacrifice the animal by either using sodium pentobarbital 85 mg/kg i.p. or using an isoflurane chamber until the animal does not respond to tail-pinching stimulation; follow by cervical dislocation.\nDisinfect the lower abdomen by wiping with 70% ethanol, gently push the two testes down to the lower abdomen, and then open the lower abdomen near the scrotum.\nPick up the epididymal fat, dissect out the whole reproductive organs (testes, epididymides, and vas deferens) and immerse in the dish with RPMI (+P/S 1:100).\nTransfer the reproductive organs in the dish with RPMI (+P/S 1:100) to an aseptic working station.\nDissect out the cauda epididymides from the connective and fatty tissues and the epididymal capsule. Place one epididymis with ~0.2 mL of Collagenase Solution in a 1.5 mL tube.Perform this step in a clean air-flow controlled working station.\nDissociation of single cells from rat cauda epididymides\nCut the epididymides in the Collagenase Solution using fine scissors until the tissue becomes a paste-like fluid. Rinse the scissors gently with the rest of (~0.8 mL) enzyme solution in the 1.5 mL tube.\nPlace the tube on a metal thermomixer for 30 min at 37 °C with a shaking speed of 1,000 rpm.\nCentrifuge the enzyme-tissue mixture at 30 x g at RT for 3 min and decant the sticky supernatant that contains mostly the sperm.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL Full-IMDM to quench all the enzymatic activity. Transfer the cell suspension to a 50 mL tube containing 49 mL RPMI (+P/S 1:100).\n\t\tNOTE: Optionally, filter the cell suspension through a 100 µm mesh membrane with constant trituration to avoid large, cell aggregates. However, do not use a mesh filter if cell suspension is needed for growing cell monolayers.",
    "Centrifuge the cellular mixture at 30 x g at RT for 10 min; decant the supernatant.\nResuspend the pellet in 1 mL Full-IMDM with gentle trituration for at least 5 min to dissociate single cells from the enzymatic treated epididymal tissue mixtures.\nSeparation of epithelial cells from other cells under aseptic conditions\nCulture the cell suspension on a 10 cm Petri dish containing Full-IMDM for at least 8 h or overnight, in an incubator at 32 °C in 5% CO2.\nPrepare sterile coverslips in advance by immersion in 100% alcohol. Air dry and dip in a small volume of the culture medium. Place the coverslips in 6 cm culture dishes or in single wells of a 24-well plate.\nNext morning, harvest the dissociated epithelial cells by gently collecting the cell suspension from the Petri dish, which consists mostly of epithelial cells. Centrifuge the cell suspension at 30 x g at RT for 5 min, and then decant the supernatant.\nResuspend the cell pellet in ~2 mL Full-IMDM.\nSeed 0.2 mL of the harvested cell suspension onto the center of each sterile coverslip.\nLet the cell suspension settle in the liquid droplet for at least 10 min to allow cells to loosely adhere to the glass coverslips. Carefully add 1 mL Full-IMDM at the edge of 10 cm dish, or 0.3 mL Full-IMDM to each well of a 24-well plate; do not disturb cells.\nKeep the isolated single cells on coverslips in the incubator at 32 °C in 5% CO2 until the patch-clamp experiments.\n3. Recording Solutions and Micropipettes\nNOTE: For the patch-clamp experiments, use the best quality chemicals and solutions.\nPreparation of stock solutions\nAutoclave all the bottles for stock storage and filter all the stock solutions (except the corrosive solutions) and filter through 0.22-µm membranes before use.",
    "Prepare all stock solutions in advance at RT, and store at 4 oC: 5 M NaCl; 1 M KCl; 100 mM MgCl2; 100 mM CaCl2; 200 mM NaH2PO4; 100 mM EGTA (pH 7.0 with KOH). Handle 5 M NaOH, 1 M HCl and 1 M KOH stocks as corrosive solutions.\nPreparation of standard external recording physiological salt solution (PSS)\nWarm the stock solutions to RT on the morning of the patch-clamp recording.\nPipette the ingredients from each stock according to the desired final volume, except CaCl2, e.g. for preparing 500 mL of PSS: 140 mM NaCl = 14 mL of 5M; 5 mM KCl = 2.5 mL of 1M; 1.2 mM MgCl2 = 6 mL of 100 mM; 1.2 mM NaH2PO4 = 3 mL of 200 mM.\nAdd double-distilled water (ddH2O) to the final volume of 400 mL and equilibrate.\nWeigh 0.9 g glucose and 1.19 g HEPES and dissolve completely in the solution mixture.\nAdd the CaCl2 stock (2.5 mM = 12.5 mL of 100 mM) with stirring.\nAdd up to 99% of final volume.\nAdjust the pH to 7.4 using NaOH or HCl.\nCheck the osmolarity and adjust using 5 M NaCl or glucose, if necessary.\nAdd ddH2O to the final volume of 500 mL in a cylinder.\nPreparation of micropipette internal solutions (low EGTA K+ -based solutions)\nWeigh or pipette the correct volume of the reagents from each stock according to the desired final volume and concentration, e.g. for preparing 50 mL low EGTA K+-based intracellular solution to a volume of ~ 30 mL ddH2O: 100 mM K-gluconate = 1.17 g; 35 mM KCl = 1.75 mL of 1 M; 2 mM MgCl2 = 1 mL of 100 mM; 0.1 mM EGTA = 0.05 mL of 100 mM; 10 mM HEPES = 0.072 g.",
    "Add enough water for ~ 95% of final volume and allow the solution to equilibrate at RT. Make sure that the solution is clear.\nWhile constantly stirring the solution, adjust the pH to 7.2 using KOH.\nWeigh and add 0.078 g Mg-ATP to the solution until it is dissolved completely.\nPlace the solution on ice and use a small aliquot for the measurement of osmolarity; typically, the solutions measures ~290 mOsmol and does not need adjustment. If the osmolarity differs significantly from 280-295 mOsmol, prepare a new solution.\nAdd ddH2O to final volume.\nDivide the solution into 500 µL aliquots, filter with a 0.2 µm syringe filter, tightly seal and immediately store at ≤ -20 °C.\nOn the date of the patch-clamp experiment, thaw one aliquot of intracellular solution on ice and keep chilled during the patch-clamp experiment to prevent degradation.\nPull the patch pipettes from glass capillaries (following pipette puller user's manual) to obtain micropipette sizes with resistance of 5-10 M when filled with intracellular solution.\n4. Setting up the Patch-Clamp Experiment and Establishing Whole-Cell Configuration with Cells\nSetting up the patch-clamp experiment\nTurn on the patch-clamp set up (computer, computer-controlled amplifier, digitizer, etc.)\nOpen the patch-clamp software (e.g. AXON pCLAMP10 or HEKA PatchMaster) and set up the protocols for electrophysiological recordings. Set the filter for the signal to low pass at 1-3 kHz and the digitizer at 10-20 kHz.\nTurn on the camera, micromanipulator and light source.\nWhen the computer-controlled amplifier is on, ground the body of experimenter by touching with hands the patch-clamp rig that has been grounded, before touching the headstage, in order to protect it from electrical shocks.",
    "Transfer the culturing epithelial cells on the glass coverslip to the recording chamber filled with ~1 mL of standard PSS at RT. Carefully change the bathing PSS at least two times using a pipette before any patch-clamp experiments.\n\t\tNOTE: Optionally, fill the perfusion system with standard PSS or another external solution according to the planned experiment. Perfuse the microscope-mounted recording chamber (RC-26G or RC-26GLP) with PSS a few times at a speed of ~2 mL/min before the start off the patch-clamp experiments. Make sure that there are no air bubbles trapped along the perfusion system.\nView and select the cells under an inverted microscope using 10X and 40X objectives equipped with a differential interference contrast optical system. Look for large single isolated cells for recording. Identify the isolated epididymal epithelial cells by their spherical shape with rough microvilli on one end of the membranes and polarized distribution of intracellular contents (Figure 1).\nUsing a 1 mL syringe (a home-made nonmetallic microsyringe needle), fill a micropipette with the internal solution (low EGTA K+-based solution, see step 3.3). Make sure that there are no air bubbles in the micropipette, which can increase the resistance of the micropipette. Use enough solution so that the internal solution submerges the chloride-coated silver wire electrode within the micropipette holder.\nMount the micropipette in the electrode holder, and apply a low positive pressure (~0.2 mL syringe volume). Keep the low positive pressure continuous until touching the cell membrane in the later steps.\nEstablishing whole-cell configuration with cells for recordings\nImmerse the pipette into the bath solution at the highest speed of the micromanipulator. Find the pipette tip in the screen connected to the digital camera; slow down the micromanipulator speed to the medium-high mode.",
    "Quickly check the micropipette resistance (5-10 MΩ) using the data acquisition interface command (e.g. \"Membrane Test\" in the AXON system) by applying a voltage step (e.g. 5 mV for 100 ms) generated from the computer-controlled amplifier. Change to a new micropipette if the resistance is significantly out of this range.\nStart to move down the objective mounted on the microscope; gradually guide the micropipette toward the selected cell. Always lower the objective first, and then lower the micropipette to the plane of focus, untilthe micropipette is above the center surface of the selected cell.\nCancel the liquid junction potential between the pipette and bath solutions to zero using the \"pipette offset\" command in the commander interface of software.\nSet the computer-controlled amplifier commander to the voltage-clamp and the membrane test to the \"Bath\" mode.\nFine focus for a clearer view of the cell, then gradually lower the micropipette using the micromanipulator at the low-medium speed.\nWhen the micropipette is close to the cell (demonstrated by a decreased current when triggered by the membrane test command), remove the low positive pressure immediately and apply a weak negative pressure (0.1 mL syringe volume) to form the gigaseal (>1 GΩ).\nMonitor the resistance with the membrane test. If the resistance is >500 MΩ but <1 GΩ, apply a negative potential (usually as the holding potential which is set to -60 mV), which can help form the gigaseal. Compensate the transient capacitive current of the micropipette.\nIf the seal is >1 GΩ and stable (as shown in the software interface), apply a brief and strong suction in order to break the cell membrane. Do not apply compensation for the series resistance and the cell capacitance.",
    "Immediately after achieving a successful whole-cell configuration, apply a 10 mV hyperpolarizing step (5-traces with minimal time intervals, 20 ms duration, signal sample at 20 kHz) from a holding potential of -60 mV.\nSwitch the voltage-mode to the zero-current mode and mark down the readings from the software interface or perform a gap-free recording (10-60 s) for the membrane potential readings of the cell.\nQuickly switch back to and remain in the voltage-mode and apply the voltage protocols according to the planned experiments and measure the current responses. Subtraction is not applied to the intrinsic leak current during the recordings.\nMonitor the stability of the responses during the recordings, or the different parameters of the cell. For example, use the \"Membrane Test\" command interface to check the input resistance (Ri), the series resistance (Rs) and the cell membrane capacitance (Cm) in the membrane test at the \"Cell\" mode during the switch of protocols.\n\t\tNOTE: Sudden drops in input resistance is usually indicative of a loose patch, and a dramatic increase in the series resistance may be indicative of micropipette tip clogging by the intracellular organelles or membrane fragments. During recording, regularly monitor the micropipette location to check if drift occurs, which may lead to the loss of the patch. If drift is a problem, carefully lift together the micropipette and the patching cell away from the bottom of recording chamber. This step may sometimes lead to the loss of the patch, in which case, it is necessary to repeat the whole-cell patch-clamp procedure.\n5. Analysis of Passive Electrophysiological Properties of Cells",
    "After obtaining the data from the patch-clamp experiments, open the gap-free data in the Clampfit software and measure the mean value for the resting membrane potential for each cell. Alternatively, use the value as marked down from the zero-current voltage at the current mode. Correct the values with the liquid junction potential (12.4 mV in this study).\nOpen the data from the 10-mV hyperpolarizing step (ΔV) obtained from a cell, measure the current difference before and during the step (ΔIstep), and calculate the input resistance (Ri) using the equation as:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55700/55700eq1.jpg\nCalculate the cell capacitance (Cm, in unit of pF) (use the same current data from the 10-mV hyperpolarizing step by integrating the total area under the membrane capacitor current during the initial transient decay current raised upon the voltage step trigger), to obtain the value of the total accumulated charge (Q, in unit of pA•ms) of the cell. Use the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55700/55700eq2.jpg\nCalculate the value of the series resistance (Rs) for each cell by fitting the initial transient current from the 10-mV negative step with a standard exponential algorithm to obtain the time constant decay current (T, in unit of ms) and use the following equation:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/55700/55700eq3.jpg\nSubscription Required.
