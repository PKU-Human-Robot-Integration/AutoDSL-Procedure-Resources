    "Ethics Statement: This study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of The Catholic University of Korea (KC12TISI0861).\n1. Isolation of Monocytic Cells from Blood\nIsolation of monocytic cells (Day -5)\n\t\nObtain at least 10 ml of fresh blood from a blood draw in a cell preparation tube (CPT).\nTransfer the blood to a new 50-ml conical tube and dilute it with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at a 1:4 ratio.\n\t\t​NOTE: A higher ratio of dilution can be used for higher purity.\nAdd 10 ml of density gradient media to a new 50-ml conical tube and carefully layer the diluted blood on top of the density gradient media. Centrifuge at 750 x g for 30 min at room temperature (RT) without a centrifugation brake.\nCarefully transfer the buffy layer to a new 50-ml conical tube, add 30 ml of PBS to the tube, and wash the cells.\nCentrifuge the cells at 515 x g for 5 min at RT.\nDiscard the PBS and resuspend the cells in 0.5 ml of blood cell media.\nCount the cells and plate 1 x 106 cells per well of a 24-well plate. Add PBS to the surrounding wells to prevent evaporation.\nStabilize the cells for 5 days at 37 °C in 5% CO2 before transduction. Add an additional 0.5 ml of fresh blood cell media on days 3-4 without disturbing the cells.\n2. Transduction by Sendai Virus\nTransduction (Day 0)\n\t\nCollect and transfer the blood cells to a 15-ml conical tube and count them using a hemocytometer.\nPrepare 3 x 105 cells per transduction and centrifuge the cells at 515 x g for 5 min at RT.\nDiscard the supernatant by suction and resuspend the cells in 0.5 ml of blood cell media.",
    "Transfer the cells to a well of a non-coated 24-well plate.\nThaw the Sendai virus mixture in ice and add it to the suspended cells. Add Sendai virus to the cells based on the manufacturer's recommendations.\nSeal the plate with a sealing film and centrifuge it at 1,150 x g for 30 min at 30 °C.\nAfter centrifugation, incubate the cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 overnight (O/N).\nCell transfer to feeder matrix (Day 1)\n\t\nThe next day, coat a 24-well plate with vitronectin. Dilute the vitronectin solution in PBS for a final 5 µg/ml concentration. Add 1 ml of vitronectin to a well of a 24-well plate and incubate it at RT for at least 1 hr. Remove the coating solution before use. Coated plates can be stored in RT for 3 days.\nTransfer all the media containing the cells and the virus to the coated well.\nCollect the remaining cells with an additional 0.5 ml of fresh blood cell media and add it to the cell-containing well.\nCentrifuge the plate at 1,150 x g for 10 min at 35 °C.\nAfter centrifugation, remove the supernatant, add 1 ml of iPSC media, and maintain the cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 O/N.\nSecond cell transfer (Day 2)\n\t\nCoat the wells of a new 24-well plate with 5 µg/ml vitronectin, as described in step 2.2.1. Use one well of the plate for each transduction.\nTransfer the cell suspension from the first plate to the newly coated vitronectin plate.\n\t\t​NOTE: If not needed, suspension cells can be discarded. The procedure mentioned in step 2.3 can be repeated 2-3 times with the suspension cells. If the steps will be repeated, harvest the cells.",
    "Meanwhile, add 1 ml of iPSC media to the well of the first plate, for maintenance, and incubate it at 37 °C in 5% CO2 O/N.\nMaintain the attached cells at 37 °C and 5% CO2 and perform a daily media change with fresh iPSC media. Colonies will appear on days 14-21 after transduction.\nCentrifuge the newly coated plate containing the suspension cells at 1,150 x g and 35 °C for 10 min.\nAfter centrifugation, incubate the cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 O/N.\nThe next day, remove the supernatant and replace it with fresh iPSC media.\n\t\t​NOTE: The procedure mentioned in step 2.3 can be repeated 2-3 times with the suspension cells. If the steps will be repeated, harvest the cells in the supernatant and repeat step 2.3.\nMaintain the attached cells with daily media changes until 80% confluency is reached.\n3. Reprogrammed Cell Maintenance\nEarly maintenance after the 24-well plate culture\n\t\n7-10 days after transduction, once the cells are confluent, prepare a vitronectin-coated, 60-mm dish. Dilute vitronectin solution in PBS for a final 5 µg/ml concentration. Add 1 ml of vitronectin to the dish and incubate it at RT for at least 1 hr.\nWash the cells with PBS and add 1 ml of PBS/1 mM EDTA to detach the cells.\nIncubate them at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2 min.\nHarvest the cells and centrifuge them at 250 x g and RT for 2 min. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in 3 ml of fresh iPSC media.\nPlate all resuspended cells onto the newly coated 60-mm dish.\nAdd 10 mM RHO kinase inhibitor to the cells and maintain them at 37 °C in 5% CO2 until the cells are 80% confluent.\nSplit for colony appearance (Subcloning Preparation)",
    "Prepare a vitronectin-coated, 100-mm dish, as described in step 3.1.2.\nWash the cells with PBS and add 1 ml of PBS/1 mM EDTA to detach the cells.\nIncubate them at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 2 min.\nHarvest the cells and centrifuge them at 250 x g and RT for 2 min.\nCount the cells using a hemocytometer and prepare 1 x 104 cells per dish.\nCentrifuge the cells at 250 x g and RT for 2 min.\nResuspend 1 x 104 cells in 6 ml of iPSC media, plate them onto the coated 100-mm dish, and add 10 mM RHO kinase inhibitor to the media.\nIncubate the cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for a week until large colonies appear.\n\t\t​NOTE: Maintain and expand the colonies for subcloning. Subcloning is usually done in under 5 passages.\nColony picking using iPSC colony detaching solution\n\t\nA week before colony picking, seed 1 x 104 cells in a vitronectin-coated, 100-mm dish, as mentioned in step 3.2.7.\nPrepare a vitronectin-coated, 60-mm dish by adding 2 ml of vitronectin solution and incubating at RT for at least 1 hr.\nBy observing through a microscope (40X or 100X magnification), mark colonies with clear boundaries using a marker pen. Remove the vitronectin solution from the new plate made in step 3.3.2 and add 6 ml of iPSC media supplemented with 10 mM RHO kinase.\nRemove the culture medium from the cells and wash them with 3 ml of PBS.\nAdd 1 ml of iPSC colony detaching solution and incubate them for 30 s at RT.\nRemove the solution from the plate and incubate it at RT for additional 30 sec.",
    "Using a P200 pipette, draw 200 µl of media from the plate and detach the targeted colonies by pipetting. Transfer the scattered colonies to the new 100-mm dish.\nIncubate and maintain the cells at 37 °C in 5% CO2.\n\t\tNOTE: After obtaining a pure iPSC colony, cells were maintained until they reached passage 10. Characterization was done after at least 10 passages. Antibody dilutions and primer information are shown in Tables 1 and 2.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
