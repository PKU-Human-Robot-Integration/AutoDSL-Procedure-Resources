    "All animal experiments were approved by the National Institute for Physiological Sciences Animal Research Committees and were in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines. For all experiments, 8-10-week-old male mice were raised under a 12/12 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and water. To visualize Ca2+ activity in microglia, ionized Ca2+ binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1)-tetracycline transactivator (Iba1-tTA) mice were crossed with tetracycline operator-GCaMP6 (tetO-GCaMP6) mice17,18. Thus, in the absence of tetracycline-analog supplementation, the Iba1 promoter drives the expression of GCaMP6, exclusively in microglia. For all experiments, doxycycline dietary supplementation was stopped at 6 weeks after birth. At the end of all experiments, mice were euthanized by isoflurane overdose followed by cervical dislocation. See the Table of Materials for details related to all materials, animals, and reagents used in this protocol.\n1. Surgical preparation of mice for in vivo two-photon imaging; day 1\nPerform all surgical procedures inside a laminar air flow cabinet to maintain sterile working conditions. Before starting surgery, sterilize the cabinet interior with UV light for 5 min.\nSterilize all work surfaces, the surgery frame, and stereotaxic instruments by wiping them down with 70% ethanol.\nSterilize all surgical instruments (scissors, forceps, razor blade, tweezers) and the custom-made head-plate to be attached to the mouse's skull by immersing them in 1% chlorhexidine gluconate solution.\nAnesthetize the mouse with ketamine (7.4 mg kg−1, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) and xylazine (10 mg kg−1, i.p.). Return it to its home cage until the anesthesia takes hold. Confirm the full induction of anesthesia by loss of the toe-pinch reflex.\nSterilize the scalp with 1% chlorhexidine gluconate. Shave away the fur with a razor blade.\nSecure the mouse within the surgery frame via stereotaxic instruments.\nApply vet ointment to the eyes to prevent dryness whilst under anesthesia.",
    "Apply 2% xylocaine jelly to the scalp for pain management. Wait for 5 min.\nRemove the scalp with scissors and expose the skull. Clean away the periosteum and dry the exposed skull surface by rubbing with cotton swabs.\n\tNOTE: The exposed skull areas must be completely dry to ensure strong bonding with the custom-made head-plate.\nSecure the custom-made head-plate to the skull with dental cement.\nOnce the cement has set, fill in any gaps between the skull surface and the borders of the custom-made head-plate with additional dental cement.\nWaterproof the cement and skull surfaces by applying acrylic-based dental adhesive resin cement.\nReturn the mouse to its home cage, placing it on a warming pad. Monitor the mouse until it regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency (within 2 h).\n\t​NOTE: Mice should be fully recovered by the next day and can then be housed with other animals.\n2. Surgical preparation of mice for in vivo two-photon imaging; day 2\nPerform all surgical procedures inside a laminar air flow cabinet to maintain sterile working conditions. Before starting surgery, sterilize the cabinet interior with UV light for 5 min.\nLaminate together two glass coverslips of different dimensions (top glass: 3 mm × 3 mm; bottom glass: 2 mm × 2 mm) with UV-curable optical grade resin.\n\tNOTE: The double coverslip provides long-term protection to the brain region exposed by the cranial window whilst enabling chronic optical access. Thus, its dimensions may be altered to suit the brain region to be imaged.\nSterilize all work surfaces and the surgery frame by wiping them down with 70% ethanol.\nSterilize all surgical instruments (steel drill, tweezers, surgical needle hook) by immersing them in 1% chlorhexidine gluconate solution.",
    "Anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane (4% induction, 1.2%-1.5% maintenance). Secure the mouse within the surgery frame via its head-plate.\nTo make a cranial window over the primary motor cortex, mark a square with dimensions of 2 mm × 2 mm centered 0.2 mm anterior to, and 1 mm lateral from, the Bregma skull landmark.\nThin the skull along the border of the marked square using the steel drill.\n\tNOTE: When close to the desired thickness, the thinned skulled areas will appear transparent when wetted with saline, and hairline cracks will start to appear.\nAfter confirming that the entire border of the marked square has been appropriately thinned, carefully insert the surgical needle hook just below the skull surface, orienting its tip toward the center of the square. Gently lift the square skull piece with the hook and use tweezers to peel it away from the rest of the skull. If bleeding occurs, continuously wash the exposed brain surface with saline until it subsides completely.\nPlace the double coverslip onto the exposed brain surface, orienting the side with the smaller coverslip toward the brain. Ensure the edges of the larger coverslip are in contact with the borders of the cranial window.\nUsing a silicon-tipped glass rod mounted in a manipulator, gently press down on the double coverslip to ensure that it makes good contact with the brain surface.\nFill the gap between the double coverslip, skull, and brain surface with UV-curable resin and irradiate with UV light until hardened (~20 s). Slowly raise the silicon-tipped glass rod away from the double coverslip.\nAllow the mouse to recover, placing it on a warming pad. Monitor the mouse until it regains sufficient consciousness to maintain sternal recumbency (30 min).\nProceed to step 3 or return the mouse to its home cage.",
    "​NOTE: After proficient surgery, the dura and all underlying blood vessels will be completely intact with no bleeding. In this case, inflammation is minimal and it is possible to immediately proceed to step 3. If unsure, wait 1-3 weeks to ensure any inflammation has fully resolved.\n3. Data collection using in vivo two-photon imaging\nTurn on the imaging setup in advance to ensure that the laser has sufficient time to warm up and stabilize. Tune the laser to emit at a wavelength of 920 nm, which is the two-photon spectrum that optimally excites the GCaMP6 fluorophore.\nPosition the mouse under a 25x microscope objective lens and habituate it for 30 min. If necessary, anesthetize the mouse with isoflurane during imaging (4% induction, 1.2%-1.5% maintenance).\n\tNOTE: Isoflurane may not be appropriate for some research applications, as it affects microglial process motility and Ca2+ activity19,20,21.\nSet the zoom to 1x, then search for microglia expressing GCaMP6 in the cranial window area. Search at a depth between 100 µm and 300 µm below the brain surface.\nOnce an appropriate GCaMP6-expressing microglia has been found, maximize the zoom so that Ca2+ activity can be captured with single cell resolution.\nVisually confirm that Ca2+ activity is clearly captured and adjust the laser power and imaging gain if necessary.\n\tNOTE: Laser power should be minimized as much as possible to avoid photobleaching and injury to microglia.\nPerform four-dimensional (4D) image acquisition as follows (steps 3.6.1-3.6.3; Figure 1B):\n\t\nSet the image dimensions to XY area = 512 × 512 pixels, 0.25 µm/pixel; Z area = five z-planes, 3 µm z-step (Figure 1B).\nSet the acquisition rate to 2.5 frames/s.\n\t\tNOTE: Z-scanning at this speed is facilitated by a piezo nano-positioning system.\nAcquire data until at least 10 individual Ca2+ events are observed (usually 10 min).",
    "4. Preparation for analysis (motion correction, mean/max z-projection)\nBefore proceeding to analyze microglial Ca2+ activity, correct the 4D images for motion-related artifacts (image registration) using the ECC image alignment algorithm22 within the MATLAB programming environment (R2020a). Download the code from: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27253-ecc-image-alignment-algorithm-image-registration.\nCreate a reference 3D image by registering all images within the first time frame using the imregister MATLAB operation (standard image processing toolbox).\nRegister all subsequent images, matching them with the corresponding z-plane of the reference 3D image using the ecc function (ECC image alignment algorithm library).\nGenerate mean intensity z-projections from the registered images using the mean MATLAB operation. If the imaging signal is too weak, generate maximum intensity z-projections instead using the max MATLAB operation.\n\tNOTE: The signal to noise ratio is worse when using maximum intensity z-projections.\nProceed to either step 5 or 6. Use the z-projections generated in step 4 as the target of analysis for mapping the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ca2+ activity in steps 5 and 6.\n5. ROI-based analysis\nUsing the z-projections generated in step 4, identify microglial processes that maintain a stable area profile (stable area) throughout the imaging period for subsequent analysis of Ca2+ activity as follows (steps 5.3-5.6):\n\t\nGenerate separate maximum intensity t-projections of the registered 4D images from 2 min samples taken at the start and end of the imaging period using the max MATLAB operation.\nBinarize the t-projections to generate polygons of the microglial morphology corresponding to the start and end of the imaging period using the imbinarize MATLAB operation. Use the automatically set default threshold.\n\t\tNOTE: If the Ca2+ signal is weak during the start and end of the imaging period, binarization may generate polygons with missing borders. In this case, manually draw the missing borders using the pencil tool in ImageJ.",
    "Overlay the t-projection polygons using the imadd MATLAB operation. The overlapping region(s) represent the stable area (Figure 2B).\nWithin identified stable areas, use the drawpolygon MATLAB operation to manually define and trace ROIs for each of the primary microglial processes and any obvious second-order sub-branches.\nTrack the absolute fluorescence intensities averaged across an individual ROI over all time frames (Figure 2C,D).\nFrom the time-series of absolute fluorescence intensities, calculate the relative change in fluorescence intensity (ΔF/F) time series according to equation (1). This time series represents the normalized microglial Ca2+ dynamics at the level of individual ROIs.\nΔF/F = (F(t) - F0) / F0 (1)\n\tWhere F(t) is the recorded fluorescence intensity at a given time and F0 is the 10th percentile of fluorescence intensity in all time frames (Figure 2E).\nIdentify candidate Ca2+ firing events occurring in a given individual ROI as follows (steps 5.5.1-5.5.3):\n\t\nApply type I finite impulse response (FIR) low-pass filtering on the ΔF/F time-series using the fir1 MATLAB operation. Set the cut-off frequency to the Nyquist value (half the sampling rate).\nVisually inspect the filtered trace to confirm that the individual trace peaks correspond to bursts of Ca2+ activity in the registered 4D images (Figure 2F).\nIdentify candidate Ca2+ firing events as concave down inflections in theΔF/F time-series trace. Define a baseline threshold as the median ΔF/F value within upper and lower ceilings that exclude the maximum and minimum 10% amplitudes over all time frames. Define a detection threshold of three SDs above the baseline threshold (Figure 2F,H).\nIdentify true Ca2+ firing events from candidates as follows (steps 5.5.1-5.5.2):\n\t\nCalculate the slope of each candidate event by differentiating across the corresponding filtered ΔF/F time series frames using the numerical gradient MATLAB operation.",
    "Subsequently identify true Ca2+ events based on the rise-time of the profile. Define a baseline threshold as the average of slope values across all candidate events. Define a detection threshold of three SDs above the baseline threshold (Figure 2G,H).\nCharacterize true Ca2+ events as follows (steps 5.6.1-5.6.3):\n\t​NOTE: The following is not an exhaustive list of parameters that can be used to characterize microglial Ca2+ events. Parameters of interest depend on the purpose of the study.\n\t\nDerive the maximum amplitude of a true Ca2+ firing event as the ΔF/F value of the corresponding ΔF/F time-series frame.\nDerive the mean amplitude of a true Ca2+ firing event as the average ΔF/F value across the entire corresponding ΔF/F time-series subset of frames.\nDerive the frequency of true Ca2+ events as the number of events divided by imaging time.\n6. Event-based analysis\nPerform event-based analysis on the z-projections from step 4 using the AQuA library within the MATLAB programming environment. Download the code from: https://github.com/yu-lab-vt/AQuA.\n\tNOTE: A general use walkthrough for the AQuA library is available from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a3lhe0dUth-5J1-S2fZlPOCZlPbeuvUr/view. Detailed documentation for the AQuA library is available from: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CckDLbrkw16b7MPlOQdYpZciIz80Snm_/view.\nAfter launching MATLAB, switch from the default working directory folder to AQuA's designated working directory folder using the cd operation.\nLoad the registered 4D images into the AQuA analysis pipeline as follows (steps 6.3.1-6.3.2):\n\t\nLaunch the AQuA GUI. Type aqua_gui in the MATLAB command window in AQuA's designated working directory folder.\nWithin the AQuA GUI, click new project and select the registered images to be analyzed. Specify the data type (GCaMPInVivo_cyto_Lck_) and imaging parameters (temporal resolution seconds per frame = 1.993; spatial resolution µm per pixel = 0.25; exclude pixels shorter than this distance to border = 5). Click open to load the data.",
    "Define landmarks for the subsequent analysis pipelines by tracing out areas of interest. Usually, landmarks are based on the cell boundary and area of the cell body.\nSubsequently, detect candidate Ca2+ events by running the automated analysis pipelines for the following parameters: active signal, super voxel, event detection, clean events, and merge events.\n\tNOTE: A detailed explanation about each of these parameters and their candidate score outputs is provided in the AQuA walkthrough. Briefly, these parameters adjust the Ca2+ event detection threshold as follows: active signal = fluorescence amplitude, super voxel = clustering of fluoresce in 3D space, event detection = rise/decay kinetics, clean events = signal to noise ratio, and merge events = temporal separation of events.\nVisually inspect the detected Ca2+ events (automatically overlayed onto the original registered images). If necessary, adjust the parameter settings of the analysis pipelines by considering the image quality in terms of the above parameters; if the image quality for a given parameter is good, a higher threshold may be set, and vice versa.\nOnce all the Ca2+ events have been detected appropriately, characterize these events within the main MATLAB environment as follows (steps 6.8-6.14):\nExport the AQuA analysis output files.\n\tNOTE: A detailed explanation about the output files, the extracted features that are used to define Ca2+ events, and the underlying parameters of these extracted features is provided in the AQuA documentation.\n(optional) Categorize all the Ca2+ events into two groups: 1) events starting at the soma, and 2) events starting at the processes.\nAccess the amplitude of individual Ca2+ events within the res.dffMat MATLAB structure of the AQuA analysis output file (.mat file).\nDerive the frequency of individual Ca2+ events using the res.fts.loc.x3D MATLAB operation (AQuA library).\nDerive the duration of individual Ca2+ events using the res.fts.curve.width11 MATLAB operation (AQuA library).",
    "Derive the area of individual Ca2+ events using the res.fts.basic.area MATLAB operation (AQuA library).\nCategorize all the Ca2+ events as: 1) local events, 2) propagative events traveling toward the soma, and 3) propagative events traveling away from the soma. To do this, use the res.fts.region.landmarkDir.chgToward and res.fts.region.landmarkDir.chgAway MATLAB operations (AQuA library) (Figure 3C)."
