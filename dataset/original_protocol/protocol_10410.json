    "1. Hydrogel Bioink Formulations and Preparation\nIn order to provide tissue-specific biochemical profiles, prepare tissue-specific ECM digest solutions as previously described for liver.20\n\tNote: In general, this ECM digest will comprise 40% of the final hydrogel bioink volume that is employed. Several hundred milliliters of ECM digest solution can be prepared, aliquoted, and frozen at -80 °C for future use.\nPrior to hydrogel formulation, dissolve a photoinitiator, 2-hydroxy-4′-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone, in water at 0.1% w/v.\n\tNote: Volumes in the 50-100 ml range can be prepared ahead of time and stored shielded from light at 4 °C for several months.\nTo form hydrogel bioinks, first dissolve the base material components from the hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel kits in the water-photoinitiator solution.\n\t\nDissolve the thiolated HA and thiolated gelatin separately in water-photoinitiator solution (step 1.2) to make 2% w/v solutions.\nDissolve polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA), the crosslinker in the hydrogel kits, in water-photoinitiator solution (step 1.2) to make an 8% w/v solution.\nDissolve polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8-Arm alkyne (10 kDa MW) in water-photoinitiator solution (step 1.2) to make an 8% w/v solution.\nIn general, form hydrogels using the following scheme, although additional customization is possible.\n\t\nCombine 4 parts 2% thiolated HA, 4 parts 2% thiolated gelatin, 1 part crosslinker 1, 1 part crosslinker 2 with 8 parts tissue ECM solution and 2 parts hepatocyte culture media (HCM) (or 10 parts water as a generic non-tissue-specific hydrogel).\n\t\tNote: Additional unmodified HA or gelatin can be added to make the bioink extrude more smoothly. This is described below.\nVortex the resulting mixture on high (speed 10 out of 10) for 10 sec to mix prior to use.\nUse of hydrogel bioink",
    "For extrusion or bioprinting testing, transfer the mixture into a syringe or printer cartridge and allow it to crosslink spontaneously for 30 min (stage 1 crosslinking) at 37 °C.\nFor rheological measurements, transfer the mixture into a 35 mm Petri dish and allow it to crosslink for 30 min.\n\t\tNote: The mixture immediately begins to crosslink through thiol-acrylate bond formation and will begin to increase in viscosity. The mixture should be transferred to a syringe, print cartridge, or target location within 10 min to avoid clogging of a pipette or syringe during transfer.\nWhen secondary crosslinking (stage 2) is desired, irradiate the stage 1-crosslinked gels with ultraviolet light (365 nm, 18 W/cm2) to initiate a thiol-alkyne polymerization reaction.\n\t\tNote: Duration of irradiation is dependent on the surface area of the material. In general, a square centimeter of material only requires 1-2 sec of UV exposure at this UV power.\n2. Printer Compatibility Testing\nPrior to integration testing with bioprinting devices, test extrusion characteristics on the laboratory bench with simple extrusion tests using standard syringes and small gauge needle tips (20-30 gauge).\n\t\nPush the bioink through a standard syringe to achieve smoothly extruded filaments of hydrogel with few or no bumps. Extruding of lines or simple patterns is sufficient to determine success.\nFor bioprinter integration, load bioink preparations by pipetting them into printer cartridges, and allow 30 min for the bioink to undergo spontaneous stage 1 crosslinking within the cartridge.\n\tNote: Volume of bioink depends on the specific application and should be determined by the user. Printer cartridges may resemble or be syringes that are compatible with the bioprinter device.",
    "Evaluate extrusion compatibility for bioprinting by printing a simple pattern using the bioink. For example, print a 7 x 7 mm pattern comprised of parallel lines. Apply pressure (e.g., 20 kPa pneumatic pressure) while the printhead moves in the X-Y plane at a velocity of approximately 300 mm/min.\n\tNote: Printhead nozzle diameters of various sizes can be used, but conical nozzles with 400-500 µM diameter openings are optimal for printing spheroids in the 250-350 µm range.\n\t\nIf the extruded materials are lumpy or irregular, see step 2.4, or reduce the amount of PEGDA to soften the stage 1 crosslinked material. Properly prepared bioink formulations extrude smoothly, allowing precise deposition in desired patterns or architectures.\n\t\tNote: The bioprinting procedures described use a custom 3-D bioprinting device designed in house specifically for tissue construct printing.32 As such, specific printing parameters vary dramatically for each type of device and require testing by the user.\nTo improve extrusion properties, supplement unmodified HA and gelatin to the bioinks (1.5 mg/ml and 30 mg/ml, respectively).\n3. Validation by Bioprinting with Primary Liver Constructs\nPrepare 3-D primary cell liver spheroids by hanging drop methods as the cellular component33\n\tNote: Bioprinting can be performed without spheroids, but instead with individual cells suspended in the hydrogel bioinks as well. Spheroids are employed here to accelerate cell-cell interactions and construct functionality. The number of spheroids or cells employed depends on the specific application and should be determined by the user. These steps should be performed under sterile conditions, using sterile supplies.\n\t\nPrepare HCM by adding the thawed contents of the HCM supplement component kit to the hepatocyte basal media (HBM) and sterile filtering.\n\t\t\nThaw the supplement components until liquid.",
    "Add the supplement components (ascorbic acid, 0.5 ml; bovine serum albumin [fatty acid free], 10 ml; gentamicin sulfate/amphotericin B, 0.5 ml; hydrocortisone 21-hemisuccinate, 0.5 ml; insulin, 0.5 ml; human recombinant epidermal growth factor, 0.5 ml; transferring, 0.5 ml) to the 500 ml HBM.\nSterile filter through a 0.45 μm or 0.22 μm filter using a bottle-top filter unit or a syringe tip filter.\nDetermine the cell density of primary human hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and stellate cells by counting on a hemocytometer after each cell type has been thawed according to manufacturers' instructions.\nCombine primary human hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, and stellate cells in an 80:10:10 ratio by cell number in HCM media that has been warmed to 37 °C in a conical tube.\n\t\tNote: The volume of media to be used depends on the overall cell number specific to the application and should be determined by the user.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension for 5 min at 520 x g at 20 °C.\nAspirate the supernatant, leaving behind the cell pellet.\nResuspend the cell pellet in HCM media to yield a cell suspension containing 1,000 cells per 40 µl media. Total volume is dependent on the number of spheroids being produced.\nTransfer the cell suspension to 96-well format hanging drop plates. Add a total of approximately 1,000 cells to each well in HCM and maintain at 37 °C, in 5% CO2 for 3 days during which multicellular spheroids form.\nCollect liver spheroids from the hanging drop plate using a pipettor. Transfer to a sterile 15 ml conical tube.\nBioprint liver spheroids in liver-specific hydrogel bioink",
    "Prepare a formulation of liver ECM-containing hydrogel bioink as described in Step 1, employing 8% PEGDA and 8% 8-Arm PEG alkyne as crosslinkers. Use this combination for its capability in resulting in a hydrogel close in shear elastic modulus to native liver tissue.\nLet the spheroids settle to the bottom of the conical tube in which they were placed in Step 3.1.7. This varies based on spheroid size and density, but generally occurs within 1-2 min. Remove all media by carefully aspirating or with a pipettor.\nTransfer the desired volume of freshly prepared hydrogel bioink solution to the conical tube containing the spheroids. Generally, an appropriate volume is 10%-25% greater than the volume of the 3-D construct to be printed. Carefully pipette up and down to resuspend the spheroids in the hydrogel bioink solution. Transfer to a bioprinter cartridge using a pipettor or serological pipette.\nInside the bioprinter cartridge, allow the solution to undergo the first crosslinking stage (thiol-acrylate reaction) for 30 min.\n\t\tNote: Depending on spheroid size, the cartridge may need to be slowly rotated or the contents may need to be mixed with a sterile spatula to keep the spheroids distributed throughout the bioink during the stage 1 crosslinking. This is less of a necessity for bioinks prepared with suspended cells instead of spheroids.\n\t\tNote: Following stage 1 crosslinking, users have an operating window of several hours. However, it is recommended to perform the bioprinting process quickly to improve cell viability.\nFollowing stage 1 crosslinking, use a bioprinting device to create desired hydrogel structures containing the primary liver spheroids (or other cells).",
    "Note: This technology provides a system for biofabricating a wide variety of structures. Parameters such as total volume, number of cells or spheroids, the printed structure geometry, and substrate on which constructs are printed are highly dependent on the goals of the user.\nAfter deposition into the desired configuration, administer UV light for 2-4 sec to initiate the secondary crosslinking mechanism, stabilizing the constructs and increasing stiffness to the desired level.\n\t\tNote: The concentration of PEG-alkyne, and thus the overall final crosslinking density, primarily controls the final construct stiffness.\nRepeat the steps 3.2.4 and 3.2.5 in order to create multi-layered constructs.\nSubscription Required.
