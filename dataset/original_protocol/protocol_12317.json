    "Ethics statement: Animal experiments were done under a UK Home office licence to MEP and the experiments carried out was approved by the University of York ethics committee in compliance with the ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines. (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/arrive-guidelines).\n1. Strategy to Generate Fluorescently Tagged Ligands\nBelow is an example protocol for subcloning Wnt8a-HA and eGFP into pCS2, in order to produce the in frame fusion construct Wnta-HA-eGFP:\nSet up and run PCR reactions for Wnt8a-HA and eGFP. Use the primer information displayed in Table1 and the Example PCR reaction and Example PCR conditions displayed in Table 2. Note: Template DNA will vary depending on the construct being produced, in this example, Wnt8a-HA is used as template DNA.\nClean up PCR reactions using a gel extraction kit, perform final elution in 30µl of molecular grade water.\nCheck 2 µl of PCR product on a 1% agarose gel prepared in TAE.\nDigest Wnt8a-HA and eGFP PCR products and pCS2 using the appropriate restriction enzymes (see Table 1), set up reactions as described in Table 2 (Example PCR product digest).\nIncubate reactions for 3 hr at 37°C and then store Wnt8a-HA and GFP PCR products on ice.\nAdd 1µl of calf alkaline intestinal phosphatase (CAIP) to pCS2 digest and incubate for 6 min at 37°C.\nHeat inactivate CAIP by incubating for 15 min at 65°C.\nRun pCS2 and PCR digests on an 1% ultrapure agarose gel prepared in TAE.\nGel extract and clean up pCS2 and PCR products using a gel extraction kit, perform final elution in 30µl of molecular grade water.\nSet up ligation as described in Table 2 (Example T4 ligation) and incubate at 12°C for 16 hr.\n2. mRNA Synthesis: Generating the Template",
    "Produce templates using restriction enzyme digestion of the following plasmids (all in the expression vector pCS2): membrane-Cerulean (memCerulean), membrane-RFP (memRFP), Shh-GFP, Wnt8a/Wnt11b-HA-eGFP.\n\t\nSet up restriction digests as described in Table 2 (Example template digest).\nMix gently and incubate the reactions for 2 hr at 37°C. \nRun 2.5 µl of digested plasmid on a 1% agarose gel (TAE) to check that the reaction has cut to completion.\nClean up the digests using a gel extraction kit, perform final elution in 50 µl of molecular grade water.\n3. mRNA Synthesis: In Vitro Transcription\nSynthesize functional mRNA using the SP6 mRNA transcription kit. Assemble the reactions in 1.5 ml DNAse/RNAse free microcentrifuge tubes.\nSet up mRNA transcription reactions as described in Table 2 (Example mRNA synthesis).\nMix the reactions gently with a pipette and then incubate at 37°C for 4 hr.\nCheck 1 µl of the reaction on a 2% agarose gel (TAE).\nAdd 1 µl of DNAse to the reaction, mix gently with a P20 and incubate the reaction for a further 15 min at 37°C.\nAdd 340 µl of molecular grade water, 40 µl of ammonium acetate and 400 µl of phenol-chloroform to the reaction. Vortex the reactions for 30 sec.\nSpin the mRNA for 5 min, 14,000 x g, 4°C.\nPipette the top (aqueous) layer from each reaction moving it to a fresh 1.5 ml screw cap microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd an equal volume of chloroform to each of the decanted reactions. Vortex the samples for 30 sec.\nSpin the mRNA for 5 min, 14,000 x g, 4°C\nPipette the top aqueous layer from each reaction moving it to a fresh 1.5 ml screw cap microcentrifuge tube.\nAdd an equal volume of isopropanol to each of the reactions and precipitate the mRNA at -80°C for 30 min.",
    "Spin each of the reactions for 15 min at 14,000 x g, 4°C to pellet the mRNA\nRemove the supernatant taking care not to disturb the pelleted mRNA\nAdd 200 µl of 70% ethanol to each of the reactions, mix the reactions and then spin for 10 min at 14,000 x g, 4°C.\nRemove the ethanol taking care not to disturb the mRNA, dry the pellet at room temperature using a vacuum desiccator or speed-vac.\nRe-suspend the mRNA in 10-20 µl of molecular grade water. Spin briefly and keep the samples on ice. Note: Heating the sample to 80 °C for 1 min can help it dissolve.\nRun 1µl of mRNA on a 2% agarose gel (TAE) and analyse 1.2 µl on a spectrophotometer to get an accurate readout of concentration.\n\tCRITICAL STEP: A concentration of 400 ng/µl of synthetic mRNA is required to carry out the following experiments.\n\tCRITICAL STEP: If the 260/280 ratio is outside of the range of 2.00-2.20, or the total amount of mRNA exceeds 12 µg, carry out a lithium chloride precipitation.\nStore mRNA in 1 µl aliquots at -80°C. Use aliquots and then throw away; do not re-freeze mRNA.\n4. Generating Xenopus laevis Embryos\nPrime Xenopus laevis females by subcutaneous injection with 50 units of human chorionic gonadotropin hormone (HCG; Chorulon) a week before the experiment.\nInduce Xenopus laevis females the night before the experiment by injecting 250 units of HCG and incubating them in the dark, O/N at 19 °C.\nDissect out testes from euthanised male frog and store in 1xNAM at 4°C. Note: Male frog is euthanised by terminal anaesthesia in accordance with Schedule 1 of Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 (https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/euthanasia).\nMassage female Xenopus laevis to induce ovulation, collect the laid eggs in a 55 mm diameter round petri dish.",
    "Produce a sperm suspension by crushing ¼ of a Xenopus laevis testis in 1 ml of deionised water.\nBrush Xenopus oocytes with the crushed sperm suspension using a Pasteur pipette and pipette bulb. CRITICAL STEP: Perform fertilisation reactions at approximately 4:30pm on the day of the experiment. \nCulture embryos at 21°C in NAM/10 (see Table 3 for solutions) in 55 mm petri dishes coated with 1% agarose diluted in water (water).\nDe-jelly embryos after 45 min using cysteine/HCL (Table 3). Note: At 21°C, embryos will reach the 2 cell stage after 90 min and cleave every 20 min after that.\n5. Microinjecting Xenopus Embryos\nUsing 1 X 90mm glass capillaries and a Narishige PC-10 dual-stage glass micropipette puller, pull micropipettes for injections. Adjust settings empirically to achieve a fine tip (less than one micron diameter).\nAttach a micropipette (needle) to a gas microinjector (for instance, the Harvard Appartaus PLI-100 PICO-INJECTOR) to repeatedly deliver precise volumes of liquid by applying a regulated pressure for a digitally set period of time. Adjust the pneumatic pressure to deliver a volume of 1.25 to 10 nanolitres as determined using a reticle or calibration slide.\nCoat a 55 mm petri dish with 5 ml of 1% agarose (water). Cut a 35-35 mm square of agarose out of the dish, this will provide a stable surface to microinject embryos.\nTransfer embryos into NAM/3 + Ficoll (Table 3) and move to injection dish.\nInject embryos in the animal hemisphere once they reach the required stage for the experiment.\n\t\nTo analyse the distribution of GFP tagged ligands on the cell surface, inject the embryos bi-laterally at the two cell stage, 10nl per cell. Example mRNA dilutions shown below for Wnt8a-HA-eGFP. CRITICAL STEP: Ensure that all mRNA concentrations start at 400 ng/µl.",
    "Note: The amount of mRNA to be injected needs to be determined empirically by testing concentrations and finding the minimum amount needed to visualise the fluorescent ligand. Western blotting using an anti-HA antibody is an essential step to determine that the mRNAs are translated to similar levels in order to allow the comparison of two different fluorescently tagged ligands; we have done this for Wnt8a-HA-eGFP and Wnt11b-HA-eGFP in Fellgett et al., 2015.\n\t\tNote: When assessing the effect of an injected mRNA (such as one coding for a candidate regulator), a typical control is to inject a non-active RNA, such as LacZ, into sibling embryos in order to control for any effects of the additional transcripts in the embryo.\n\t\t\nDilute memRFP mRNA 1 in 4 (1µl + 3µl dH2O) with molecular grade water to reduce the concentration to 100 ng/µl.\nDilute Wnt8a-HA-eGFP mRNA 1 in 4 (1µl + 3µl dH2O) with molecular grade water to reduce the concentration to 100 ng/µl.\nMix memRFP mRNA in a 1:1 ratio with Wnt8a-HA-eGFP mRNA.\nMix mRNA from 5.5.1.3 in a 1:1 ratio with either the control mRNA LacZ or a modulator such as Sulf1.\nInject embryos bilaterally at the 2 cell stage with 10nl of mRNA per cell (total of 20nl). Note: This results in 250 pg of memRFP, 250 pg of Wnt8a-HA-eGFP, 500 pg of Wnt11b-HA-eGFP and 2 ng of LacZ or Sulf1 mRNA being injected into each cell.\nTo analyse the diffusion of GFP tagged ligands, inject mRNA coding for ligand-GFP together with a lineage marker such as memRFP at the 16-32 cell stage, 1.25 nl per cell.",
    "To analyse the effects of any potential modulator of ligand diffusion, co-inject mRNA coding for the modulator together with the ligand and lineage tracer. Alternatively, inject neighbouring cells: one with mRNAs coding for the GFP-tagged ligand and a lineage tracer (memRFP) and the other with mRNAs coding for the modulator and a different lineage tracer (memCerulean).\nTransfer embryos to a 12.5°C incubator and culture until the following day, Nieuwkoop and Faber (NF) stage 8.\n6. Excising Animal Cap Explants\nTransfer embryos to a 55 mm petri dishes coated with 5 ml of 1% agarose (water). Fill the dish with NAM/2 (Table 3).\nTake circular animal caps using Tungsten needles. CRITICAL STEP: Take large caps at this stage as these will heal better and be easier to image, keep control caps to ensure no convergent extension occurs.\nTransfer animal explants to 55 mm petri dishes coated with 1% agarose (water) and culture embryos at 21°C for 4 hr. CRITICAL STEP:The 4 hr incubation is required to allow fluorescent proteins to mature.\nGenerate relief slides by sticking down two layers of PVC insulation tape onto microscope slides. Cut a 14 mm by 10 mm rectangle out of the tape to leave a chamber for mounting animal caps. CRITICAL STEP: Flatten both layers of tape thoroughly onto the slide before cutting the rectangle.\nPipette 2 separate droplets of NAM/2 (Table 3) into the relief slide, approximately 30 µl per drop.\nTransfer animal explants to the relief slides using a cut off P20 tip and orientate so that the apical side faces upwards. Note: Each slide can hold 10-15 animal caps. CRITICAL STEP: At this stage the animal caps should have partially healed, this means they are less delicate and can be orientated using forceps.",
    "Gently lower a glass cover slip onto the relief slide and allow the cover slip to dry for 20 min. CRITICAL STEP: The size of the animal cap is crucial; ensure the cap is big enough that when the glass coverslip is lowered onto the relief slide it compresses the apical layer of animal cap cells enough to produce a flat surface to image. If the animal caps are too small still then reduce the PVC tape to one layer.\nSeal the slide using nail varnish. CRITICAL STEP: Do not use too much nail varnish to seal the relief slides because if the PVC tape becomes too damp it will raise up and ruin the slide.\nDry relief slides for 20 min in the dark and they are ready to image, typically animal caps will remain healthy for 4-6 hr once sealed in the slide.\n7. Imaging\nNote: Imaging was carried out using an inverted confocal microscope. Lambda mode was chosen for imaging as this allowed multiple fluorophores with overlapping signatures to be used, and removed the problem of potential sample movement between scans.\nFind explants using a low magnification objective then switch to 63x/1.4 oil objective for higher resolution imaging.\nSwitch on requisite lasers; for this example the 405 laser was used to excite memCerulean, the 488 laser was used to excite GFP and the 561 laser to excite memRFP using 405 and 488/561 dichroic mirrors.\nUse lambda mode (In Zen 2011, select lambda mode – 32 bins).\nSelect the 405nm, 488nm and 561nm lasers.To permit a wider field of view, zoom out the image (to 0.6x).\nSet the frame size to the desired image size (1024 x 1024 with pixel sizes of 220nm was used for this data set).",
    "Set averaging to typically 4 to 8 to increase the signal to noise ratio.\nOptimise the pinhole (1 airy unit according to the 561nm laser was used for this data set).\nOptimise the laser powers. CRITICAL STEP: Balance the 405nm, 488nm and 561nm lasers such that all fluorophores can be detected using the 32 detector array whilst minimising the amount of voltage and gain required.\nCollect the light being emitted from memCerulean, GFP and memRFP. For this work light was collected every ~10nm from 415-720nm, although larger collection intervals are also possible (e.g., every ~20 nm).\n8. Image Analysis\nInvestigating the effects of modulators on the cell surface expression of GFP-tagged ligands\n\tNOTE: The following steps are a detailed guide of how the analysis was performed in our laboratory. The end user may want to streamline the process by writing an ImageJ or FIJI script to remove some of the manual steps.\nCRITICAL STEP: It is important the end user samples the spectra of any fluorophores used in the same conditions that the final experiment is performed in order to perform effective spectral unmixing of the multiple fluorophores used in the final experiment.\n\tTwo main types of analysis are performed in this section:\n\t\nCalculating the total number of Wnt-HA-eGFP pixels co-localising with the cell membrane.\n\t\t\nUnmix the green, red and cerulean channels using spectra sampled from single injections of these fluorophores in ZEN software. Save these images as separate LSM documents to use in all of the following steps.\nOpen LSM files directly in image editing software. Note: The following instructions are for FIJI Image J.\nSave the LSM images as image sequence documents, this will automatically split the images into the separate channels.",
    "Save the image sequence into the same folder as the scripts for the script analysis software that will be used to analyse the data(see supplemental code files for actual script). Note: The following instructions are for Matlab. \nOpen up the script analysis software and open the directory in which the scripts are written.\nEnter the file name under Location analysis, the software will take the file name and perform the analysis.\n\t\t\tNote: The file names will read ImageA0000 and ImageA0001 for each image. The script analysis software will use the image marked 0001 as the mask and analyse the percentage of pixels in image 0000 that co-localise with this mask.\nTake the percentage co-localisation number (annotated as Cell membrane populated) and copy this to a spreadsheet. Note: The following instructions are for Excel.\nPlot the percentage co-localisation number on a bar chart either as an absolute or relative value. \nAnalysing the number, size and shape of Wnt-HA-eGFP puncta.\n\t\t\nOpen unmixed LSM files directly in image editing software. Note: the following instructions are for FIJI Image J.\nSplit each image into its separate channels (Image > Colour > Split channels).\nThreshold both the Wnt-HA-eGFP and the membrane marker channels (Image > Adjust > Auto-threshold). CRITICAL STEP: Try a number of thresholds to see which one produces a representative image, without overexposing the channel.\nConvert the membrane marker channel to a mask (Process > Binary > Make mask).\nInvert this mask (Edit > Invert).\nConvert the Wnt-HA-eGFP puncta to a mask as above.\nSubtract the membrane marker mask from the ligand-GFP mask (Process > Image calculator > Wnt mask in top box, membrane mask in bottom box).\nUse the analyse particle function. From here, select the required parameters and analyse the data (Analyse > Analyse particles).",
    "Copy the number of particles, average particle size and circularity data into a spreadsheet and then plot graphs from these data. Note: For this analysis, only particles between 0.1-10µm2 size were analysed, no restrictions were placed on particle circularity. This instruction is for Excel.  \nAnalysing the range of ligand diffusion\n\t\nOpen up all unmixed images in confocal imaging software and then export the files in a TIF format, as raw data and as an RGB image. Note: This instruction is for Zen lite 2011.CRITICAL STEP: Include a scale bar on at least one of the images so that distance can be calculated during the analysis.\nOpen the images to be analysed in image analysis software. Note: The following instructions are for Photoshop.8.2.3) Right click on the background of the image and select ‘layer from background’, to create a new layer.\nSet the membrane marker channels to 0, so that only the ligand-GFP channel is visible (Layer > New adjustment layer > Channel mixer). CRITICAL STEP: Clip the new adjustment layer to the image being analysed, the option to clip the new layer to this image is available as a tick box after clicking on the channel mixer option.\nOpen a new workspace. Set the resolution to 300 pixels per inch and the colour mode to RGB colour (File > New > Clipboard).\nCopy all of the images being analysed into the single workspace (Click on the image and it’s clipped channel mixer by holding control then hold control and Alt and drag the image into the workspace).\nOrientate all of the images so that the maximum length of diffusion for each image can be measured along the horizontal axis, with the cells expressing Wnt-HA-eGFP orientated to the left.",
    "Save the work space as a TIF and then open this in the image analysis software. Note: The following instructions are for FIJI Image J.\nOpen the ROI manager window (Analyse > Tools > ROI manager).\nDraw a rectangle on the first image, the exact size of the rectangle can be specified (Select rectangle tool and draw any rectangle > Edit > Selection > Specify). Note: A size of 650 x 100 pixels length x width was used in this study.\nPosition the rectangle on the very edge of the domain expressing Wnt-HA-eGFP. Place the rectangle over the region with the maximum distance of Wnt-HA-eGFP diffusion. CRITICAL STEP: Even without the membrane marker the regions expressing Wnt-HA- eGFP should be visible due to background fluorescence; if not then consult raw images.\nShift the box 10 µM to the right. Determine the number of micrometres by measuring the length of the scale bar included in one of the images (Draw a line tracing the scale bar > Analyse > set scale). Note: This provides a value for 10 uM in pixels.\nAdd the box to the ROI manager by pressing the add button in ROI manager window.\nMove rectangle to the next image to be measured by clicking back on the rectangle tool to move the rectangle. Repeat steps 8.2.10-11.\nOnce all of the panels have been measured, select multiplot from the ROI manager menu (ROI manager > More > Multiplot > List).",
    "Note: the data represents Wnt pixel intensity (Y) with increasing distance along the horizontal axis (X, measured in Pixels). The value for Y is the average signal intensity of ligand-GFP at the point X and the average is calculated from all of the pixels in the Y axis for each X value. Consequently the taller the box, the more pixels will be analysed to produce this average. A small box (in the Y axis) will be noisier; a tall box will have very low average pixel intensity.\nCopy the data from the multiplot box into a spreadsheet and re-label accordingly. Note: The following instructions are for Excel.\nDiscard the first 10-20µm of data from each analysis as this represents background fluorescence from ligand-GFP expressing cells and distorts the graphs.\nOpen up scientific analysis and graphing software and create a new notebook. Note: The following instructions are for Sigmaplot 13.\nLabel the required number of columns for the data by double clicking on the horizontal numbers on the worksheet and labelling them distance in µm, Wnt8a-HA-eGFP and Wnt11b-HA-eGFP.\nCopy data from the spreadsheet into the relevant columns in the scientific analysis and graphing software.\nCreate a scatter graph (Create graph > Scatter > Multiple scatter > Select X many Y > Select the distance column for X > Select Wnt8a-HA-eGFP and Wnt11b-HA-eGFP for the Y values > Finish).\nPerform regression analysis on Wnt8a-HA-eGFP curve by left clicking on a Wnt8a-HA-eGFP point on the scatter graph. All of the points should highlight. Click on Analysis > Regression wizard.\nSelect the curve equation category (Exponential decay) and the equation name (Single, 3 parameter) then press next.\nSelect the X and Y values to which the curve should be fitted (if the data was highlighted previously, this should be done automatically) then press next.",
    "Continue through the wizard until the Numeric Output options page, ensure ‘create report’ is ticked then press next. Note: The parameters for the fitted curve will be shown in Report 1*.\nOn the Graph options page ensure ‘add equation to graph title’ is ticked then press finish. Note: The wizard will have created Report 1* and Graph 1* tabs at the top of the note book. In addition the curve will have been added to the graph produced in (8.2.20).\nRepeat steps 8.2.21-8.2.25 to fit a curve for Wnt11b-HA-eGFP. CRITICAL STEP: try fitting multiple equation categories and equation names to the data. Note: The curve with the best fit should produce the highest R2 value with the lowest residual sum of squares. \nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
