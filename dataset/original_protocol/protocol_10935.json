    "This study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration. All participants were informed of the purpose and safety of the experiment and signed the informed consent form before participation. This study was approved by the institutional review board of Jiangsu University of Science and Technology.\n1. Experiment procedure\nPreparation for the experiment\n\t\nExplain informed consent to the participants and ask them to sign the consent form.\nPerform a color vision test on the participants to confirm that they have normal color discrimination.\nPresent 30 mineral water brands to participants and ask them to pick the brands that they are familiar with, to ensure that they are unfamiliar with the brands of mineral water used in the experiment.\nIntroduce the procedure of the experiment to the participants.\nConduct a pre-experiment on the participants using mineral water brands other than the ones used in the study, and ensure that they are familiar with the AR and website operations.\nDirect each participant from Group A to perform the AR experiment first, and then to perform the website experiment. Direct each participant from Group B to perform the website experiment first, and then to perform the AR experiment.\nWearing instruments\n\t\nfNIRS probes\n\t\t\nClean the forehead skin of the participants with skin preparation gel (see Table of Materials).\nWrap the probes (see Table of Materials) in a plastic wrap for sweaty circumstances. Fix the probes on the FP1 and FP2 position according to the international 10-20 system with a black headband45. Use a black bandana to cover the probes to protect them against ambient light and improve signal quality.\nClean the transmitter and receiver of the probes using a 70% isopropyl alcohol pad after finishing the experiment.",
    "Eye tracker: Capture eye movement in real-world environments using eye tracking glasses (see Table of Materials). Fit prescription lenses on the head unit of the eye tracking glasses magnetically (if required) and ensure that the participants can walk around freely with a corrected sight.\n\t\t​NOTE: Because the eye tracking glasses are not designed to work in conjunction with standard eye glasses, participants who wear eye glasses may still be included in the study by using optional prescription lenses for correction of either short-sightedness or long-sightedness. Participants can also wear standard contact lenses because although they may slightly increase noise, they do not normally introduce errors in the data. Participants cannot use colored or other lenses that change the appearance of the pupil or iris.\n2. Measures\nfNIRS\n\t\nOpen the recording software (see Table of Materials). Connect the probes to a laptop via a Bluetooth adapter, and then record the changes of concentration of oxygenated hemoglobin (O2Hb) in the participants' prefrontal cortex through the laptop, with a sampling frequency of 10 Hz.\nCheck the received light intensity and tissue saturation index (TSI) quality to control data quality. Ensure that the received signal is located between 1% and 95%.\nEnsure that the participants sit in a comfortable position on a chair and maintain the resting state for 2 min to collect baseline data before the real experiment.\nClick on the Start button on the software interface to record the fNIRS data.\nEye tracking\n\t\nSet up the hardware for the eye tracking glasses. Connect the USB plug of the eye tracking glasses to a USB port on the laptop. Open the recording software (see Table of Materials) and set the sampling frequency to 120 Hz.",
    "Calibration: Perform a one-point-calibration. Ask the participant to focus on a clearly identifiable object in their field of view at 0.6 m. Move the crosshair cursor to the object, where the participant is focused on in the scene video and click on the object.\nPress the Record button on the software interface to start recording.\nQuestionnaire and scale: Present the usability questionnaire and NASA-TLX scale to the participants after they complete the tasks of the AR/website.\n3. Data analysis\nfNIRS data processing\n\t\nConvert the optical density values obtained from the fNIRS recording software into concentrations (μmol) according to the modified Beer-Lambert Law46.\nFilter the raw data at low-pass 0.5 Hz to remove systematic noises such as heartbeats and respiration.\nCheck and correct the data for motion artifacts by removing the data segments that exceeded three standard deviations above the entire time-series47.\nExport the mean and maximum fNIRS data in the AR and website conditions, and then subtract them from the baseline data.\nEye tracking data processing\n\t\nExport the fixation frequency (count/s), total fixation time (ms), average fixation time (ms), saccade frequency (count/s), average saccade time (ms), and average scan path length (px/s) of the participants.\nStatistical analysis\n\t\nPerform a two-tailed test at a significance level of 0.05. Check the data normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and perform a difference test. Perform multiple comparison corrections for p-values using the false discovery rate (FDR) method.\n\t\tNOTE: While performing the difference test, the data that followed a normal distribution were analyzed using a paired samples t-test, and the data that did not follow a normal distribution were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test.\nSubscription Required.
