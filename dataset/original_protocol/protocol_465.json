    "Cell Culture:\n1) Care and culture of the SVEC4-10 cell line is according to the supplier&#x2019;s protocol \\(American Type Culture Collection).\n2) Passage cells according to the supplier&#x2019;s protocol.\nPlating Transwell Insert:\n1) Check tissue culture flasks to ensure endothelial cell cultures are viable and have achieved confluence.\n2) Before passage of cells, prepare 0.1% gelatin mixture to place on transwell insert. Prepare by the following procedure:\n 0.1% Gelatin Mixture\n 0.1 g gelatin\n 1 tab PBS\n 100 mL sterile water\n        2a) Place above ingredients into glass flask and place on hot plate with stir bar.\n        2b) Heat and stir mixture gently for 4-5 minutes, or until solution clears.\n        2c) Pass mixture through filtration system \\(Corning).\n3) Remove transwell inserts from 24 well plates and place them inverted into a 12 well plate.\n4) Pipette 100 &#x3BC;L of 0.1% gelatin solution over each inverted transwell insert.  Place plate into incubator at 37&#xB0;C for 2 hours.\n5) Passage cells as described in manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol. Place cells into 50cc conical tube and centrifuge at 250 x g, 4&#xB0;C, 5 minutes.\n6) Discard supernatant.  Add 1 ml culture medium and count live cells with 0.02% Trypan Blue.  \n7) Resuspend cells at a concentration of 7.5x10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml.\n8) Remove plate from incubator and remove liquid gelatin overlying insert with pipette, being careful not to scratch or puncture the membrane. \n9) Place 100 &#x3BC;l of resuspended cells \\(7.5x10<sup>4</sup> cells) on inverted gelatin covered transwell insert. \n10) Replace into incubator for 3 days. \nAssess confluence of endothelial cells on transwell inserts:\n1) Remove culture plate from incubator.  Remove a single transwell insert from the culture plate and replace plate into incubator\n2) Fix transwell in methanol for 30 seconds.\n3) Place sample in Hematoxylin component stain for 30 seconds.",
    "4) Transfer sample to Eosin component stain for 30 seconds.\n5) Rinse in water for 5 seconds.\n6) Remove mesh membrane with endothelial cells from transwell insert with sharp forceps, being careful not disrupt the cell monolayer.\n7) Place on slide with tissue fixative and cover with slide cover.\n8) Assess for evenly confluent cell layer. If endothelial cells have reached confluence, may proceed to transendothelial migration assay.\nT cell preparation:\n1) Euthanize mice.  \n2) Retrieve desired tissues for T cell harvest, e.g. spleen, lymph nodes, etc.\n3) Place tissues in 50 ml conical tubes with 15 ml complete RPMI medium 1640.\n4) Carefully dissociate tissues, removing stromal components.\n5) Wash cells x3, 250 x g, 4&#xB0;C, for 5 minutes.\n6) Remove supernatant and treat cells with ACK Red Blood Cell lysing buffer per manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol.  Treat for 5 minutes at room temperature. \n7) Add 30 ml media and wash x3, 250 x g, 4&#xB0;C, for 5 minutes.  Remove supernatant and resuspend cells in 1-2 ml 1x R &amp; D T-cell enrichment column buffer.\n8) Isolate T cells via enrichment column per manufacturer&#x2019;s protocol.\n9) Wash cells x3, 250 x g, 4&#xB0;C, for 5 minutes.\n10) Resuspend cells in 1 ml complete medium.  Count cells in 0.02% Trypan Blue stain.\n11) Resuspend T cells at concentration of 5x10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml and store on ice.\n12) T cells or other leukocytes can also be prepared according to local laboratory protocols.\nMigration Assay:\n1) After assessing confluence as per directions above, remove 12-well plates with inverted transwell inserts from incubator. \n2) Remove bead of medium overlying inverted transwell inserts with 200 &#x3BC;l pipette, being careful not to scratch the surface of the membrane.\n3) Remove inverted transwell inserts from 12 well plates and replace in proper position into 24 well plates.",
    "4) Place 600 &#x3BC;l of complete medium with appropriate chemotactic signal \\(e.g., chemokine) in bottom of well. Add 100 &#x3BC;l of previously prepared T cells \\(5x10<sup>5</sup> cells) to upper chamber of transwell.  Set up wells in triplicate for each condition.\n5) Incubate, 37&#xB0;C, 4 hours.\n6) Remove plate from incubator. Remove transwell inserts and gently agitate remaining unmigrated cells in upper chamber with a pipette and remove for quantification. Membranes with endothelial monolayers can be removed with sharp forceps and stained per local laboratory protocol to asses cells within endothelium.\n7) Resuspend cells in lower well in 1 ml medium and count using hemacytometer to quantify migration."
