    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPreparation of cell lines overexpressing therapeutic protein cargo\nTiming: ∼ 4 weeks\nThis process details the establishment of stable C17.2 cell lines overexpressing DNAJB6 at high amounts (Figure 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig2]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2504-Fig2.jpg\nFigure 2. Schematic overview of generation of monoclonal stable cell line expressing the recombinant protein of interest\n(A) Nucleofection of plasmid encoding recombinant protein of interest into C17.2 cells using Nucleofection.\n(B) Selection of the transgenic population by applying antibiotic pressure.\n(C) Establishing a monoclonal stable cell line.\n(D) Selection of the clone expressing high amounts of recombinant protein of interest.\nWe present here a method of monoclonal cell preparation using a paper disc method, which is a labor- and cost-effective method of generating a monoclonal cell line without the need for sophisticated equipment such as a FACS sorter.\nCritical: In our hands, lipofection and lentiviral transduction did not result in stable C17.2 cell lines with high exogenous protein expression (which is necessary for high protein loading in EVs, which in turn would improve the therapeutic efficacy of EVs). Nucleofection gave the best results in terms of high protein expression. Hence, we have used nucleofection in this protocol.\nNote: Nucleofection, combining cell type-specific Nucleofector Solution and electrical pulses, facilitates DNA entry into the nucleus, increasing the chance of genomic integration upon antibiotic selection.\nSeed 2–3 × 106 C17.2 cells per 15 cm cell culture dish (1 for each plasmid nucleofection) and incubate at 37°C/ 5% CO2 overnight resulting in 3–4 × 106 cells/ 80% confluency.\nRemove the culture medium from the cells and wash cells once with Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS), using at least the same volume of PBS as culture medium.",
    "Proceed with harvesting by incubating cells at 37°C with trypsin/EDTA for 3 min or until all cells are detached from the culture dish surface.\nAdd complete medium to the dish, and pipette up and down until you get a homogenous single-cell suspension.\nTake 10 μL from the single-cell suspension and determine the cell density with a hemocytometer.\nCentrifuge 1 × 106 cells/condition at 200 g for 10 min at room temperature (RT). During this time, prepare nucleofection materials:\nAdd Supplement solution to the Nucleofector™ Solution (supplied in the kit).\nStart 4D-Nucleofector™ System (Lonza) and upload DN-100 experimental parameter file as for C17.2 cells, SG transfection solution and Nucleofector™ program DN100 showed good results (refer to this protocol https://bioscience.lonza.com/lonza_bs/CH/en/download/product/asset/21623[href=https://bioscience.lonza.com/lonza_bs/CH/en/download/product/asset/21623], however note that the program is DN100 instead of that mentioned in the protocol, follow the procedure for 100 μL Nucleocuvette™).\nFill 10 mL complete culture medium in each 10 cm cell culture plate (one plate per condition) and pre-incubate/equilibrate plates in a humidified 37°C/5% CO2 incubator.\nPre-warm an aliquot of culture medium to 37°C. Prepare plasmid DNA.\nAfter 10 min of centrifugation, remove the supernatant and resuspend the cell pellet carefully in RT 4DNucleofector™ Solution.\nAdd 5 μg of plasmid DNA to this suspension (max. 10% of final sample volume) and transfer to a Nucleocuvette™ Vessel.\nRepeat this procedure for the rest of Nucleocuvette™ Vessels as required.\nNote: As prolonged incubation of cells in Nucleofector™ Solution may lead to reduced transfection efficiency and viability it is important to work as quickly as possible. Avoid air bubbles while pipetting.\nCritical: Make sure to have <85% cell confluency when collecting cells for nucleofection. Cell confluency >85% will result in reduced transfection efficiencies.",
    "Note: C17.2 cells tend to grow faster at higher passage number, and eventually tend to differentiate into elongated cells that stop dividing. Hence, it is advisable to use cells with low passage number (<15) to generate a stable cell line by means of nucleofection.\nTap the Nucleocuvette™ Vessels gently to cover the sample at the bottom of the cuvette.\nClose the lid and place the cuvette into the retainer of the 4D-Nucleofector™ X Unit in proper orientation.\nPress Start on the display of the 4D-Nucleofector™ Core Unit (for details, please refer to the device manual https://bioscience.lonza.com/lonza_bs/NL/en/document/31856[href=https://bioscience.lonza.com/lonza_bs/NL/en/document/31856]).\nRemove the cuvette from the retainer after completing the run.\nResuspend the cells with pre-warmed medium and mix by pipetting gently only two to three times using the supplied pipettes with the kit avoiding bubble formation.\nAdd the cells to the cell culture plates ready from 6c.\nIncubate the cells in humidified 37°C/5% CO2 incubator. Gene expression is often detectable after only 4–8 h.\nTwo days post-transfection, check the transfection efficiency.\nNote: In our hands, it was ∼50% with 40%–60% cell viability.\nReplace the complete medium with the one supplemented with 3 μg/mL puromycin.\nNote: Generally, 1 μg/mL puromycin is sufficient for polyclonal cell line preparation. However, to select cells with high expression of recombinant protein, a higher puromycin concentration is recommended).\nOver the next few days non-transfected cells will die. To remove dead cells and cell debris, refresh the medium with fresh medium with puromycin every other day.\nAfter a couple of weeks, only cells that have incorporated the exogenous DNA into their genome will have survived the antibiotic selective pressure. A representative fluorescence micrograph of cells expressing XP-GFP-DNAJB6 is shown in Figure 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig3].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2504-Fig3.jpg\nFigure 3. Polyclonal cells expressing XP-GFP-DNAJB6 protein post-nucleofection and post-antibiotic application",
    "GFP and Gray inverse images show the same field of view. White arrows highlight the perinuclear location of accumulated XP-GFP-DNAJB6 in multivesicular bodies where sEVs are generated.\nNote: These are polyclonal cells with various degrees of recombinant protein expression. The accumulated signal (white arrows in inverse grayscale image) indicates the localization of the recombinant protein in multivesicular bodies.\nWash cells with HBSS thoroughly to remove cellular debris, trypsinize cells, and divide over 3 dishes. Return cells to incubator for 2 days.\nAfter 2 days incubation, trypsinize cells with 1.5 mL trypsin/EDTA, and resuspend cells in 10 mL complete medium.\nKeep 2 mL cell suspension aside, and pellet down the 8 mL cell suspension at 200 g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant, add 4 mL freezing medium (complete medium with 10% DMSO) and divide over 4 cryogenic vials and freeze the cells.\nNote: These are backup polyclonal cell line vials, which can be thawed in case of contaminations during the monoclonal cell line establishment.\nCount cells in the 2 mL cell suspension from (23), and seed 50 and 100 cells in 2 different 10 cm dishes. Add 20 mL complete medium. Place the dishes in the incubator.\n24 h post seeding, check if cells have attached to the bottom of the dish and if they look healthy. If everything seems okay, return the dish to the incubator and leave it untouched for 6 more days.\nAfter 1 week post seeding, check for colonies. By now, there should be single colonies visible. They should grow apart from each other as this is important for picking single colonies later on.\nThere should be at least 100 cells per colony. Keep checking the size of the colonies every now and then. Generally, colonies will be ready for picking 2 weeks post-seeding.",
    "In the meantime, cut out Whatman paper (number 1) discs with a punching machine and autoclave them.\nAt the day of colony picking, seal the dish with parafilm. Clean the microscope stage with 70% ethanol and screen the dish for colonies with GFP fluorescence. Encircle the colonies (> 12 clones) with highest fluorescence on the bottom of the dish using a marker pen.\nRemove the parafilm and place the dish back in the incubator. Warm up cell culture medium, trypsin and HBSS. Take 5 mL trypsin in a small dish. Put 12–15 autoclaved paper discs in the lid of the dish.\nDistribute 500 μL complete medium per well in a 24 well plate. Label the wells with numbers.\nTake the dish with colonies out of the incubator and place it in the laminar flow. Wash with HBSS twice. Flame the tweezers twice and let them cool down.\nMeanwhile, remove HBSS from the dish. From this time onwards, one has to work fast in order to prevent cells from drying. Take a paper disc, dip it in trypsin/EDTA and put on the encircled colony. Repeat this for all the colonies. Keep the dish in the incubator for 3 min.\nPick the paper discs one by one and put one disc per well in the 24 well plate.\nAfter transfer of all discs to the 24 well plate, pipette up and down medium in every well with a separate tip with a 1 mL micropipette to rinse the discs with the medium.\nPlace the 24 well plate in the incubator.",
    "Keep checking this plate daily. It will take 4–5 days before cells are detected in the wells. Once the wells are around 70% confluent, discard the Whatman paper discs, transfer cells from one well in 24 well plate to one well in 6 well plate.\nSelect clones that show the maximum amount of GFP and GFP-DNAJB6 expression at the expected localization of XPack™ tagged proteins, i.e., at the plasma membrane and endosomal structures.\nNote: These clones are your parental cell lines for XP-GFP and XP-GFP-DNAJB6 loaded extracellular vesicle production, respectively.\nTransfer each of the selected clones to a separate 10 cm dish, and let cells grow until 80% confluence. Expand each 10 cm dish to 3 10 cm dishes. Freeze cells from 2 dishes in 5 cryogenic vials. Use the remaining 10 cm dish for downstream processing.\nCritical: Expression of XPack™ tagged GFP fusion proteins produces a cellular distribution pattern similar to sEV marker proteins, e.g., the tetraspanin CD9. Specifically, some of the GFP signal is localized on the plasma membrane and most is localized at multivesicular endosomes.1[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1]\nCleaning coverslips for microscopy\nTiming: ∼ 30 min\nThis section describes the preparation of cleaning coverslips for microscopy (Figure 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig4]).\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2504-Fig4.jpg\nFigure 4. Schematic overview of the cleaning coverslips for microscopy\n(A) Dip a coverslip in 100% ethanol.\n(B) Remove excess ethanol by touching the coverslip to the beaker wall.\n(C) Flame the coverslip by holding it in the flame for a second.\n(D) Extinguish the flame by shaking the coverslip.\n(E) Place 1 coverslip per well.\nWe use 13 mm glass coverslips (VWR) to seed cells on in 24 well plates. For quick and effective cleaning, we advise the procedure below which involves dipping the coverslips in 100% ethanol and flaming them to remove dirt and for sterilization.",
    "Use dissecting forceps to hold coverslips gently but firmly to avoid any breakage.\nAliquot 100 mL 100% ethanol in a Scott Duran bottle. Transfer 10–15 mL 100% ethanol from this into a small glass beaker under the cleaned laminar flow.\nPlace a 24 well plate under the laminar flow.\nTake out one coverslip from its case with the forceps, and dip it in the ethanol, ensuring that it is fully submerged.\nRemove the coverslip and touch the beaker wall to remove excess ethanol.\nStart the flame under the hood and swiftly pass the coverslip through the flame for the residual ethanol on the coverslip to catch fire. Stop the flame.\nNote: Keep the beaker with ethanol away from the flame!\nKeep moving the forceps slowly in the air until the flame is extinguished.\nCritical: It is important to keep moving the forceps in order to avoid the breakage of coverslips due to overheating. Keep your hand with forceps away from the beaker with ethanol to avoid fire mishaps. Alternatively, use 70% ethanol and UV light for sterilization.\nPlace one coverslip per well in the sterile 24-well plate.\nThe wells containing coverslips are now ready for cell seeding.\nCharacterization of donor cell lines using immunostaining\nTiming: ∼ 3 days\nThis section describes how to characterize the exosome donor cell lines for the presence of exosome marker proteins using immunostaining.\nNote: Characterization of donor cell lines using immunostaining for extracellular vesicle markers – It needs to be ensured that XP-tagged proteins are localized in multivesicular bodies and colocalize with extracellular vesicle marker proteins\nTrypsinize wild type (WT), XP-GFP, and XP-GFP-DNAJB6b C17.2 cells, count and seed 3 × 104 cells in each well with coverslip in the 24 well plate and incubate for 24 h at 37°C.",
    "24 h post seeding, fix cells with 4% PFA in PBS for 30 min at RT and wash with PBS twice.\nPermeabilize cells with 0.2% Tween-20 (Sigma, P1379) in PBS for 5 min at RT and rinse with PBS before blocking with blocking buffer (3% BSA (Sigma, A7906)/PBS) for 1 h at RT.\nDilute primary antibody against CD9 in blocking buffer (1:200) and add to cells. Incubate cells with antibody overnight at 4°C.\nNote: Alternatively, CD63, ALIX, TSG101 and HSP90 may also be used as markers of multivesicular endosomes.6[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib6]\nThe next day, rinse cells with PBS thrice and incubate with secondary antibody (dilution 1:500) and DAPI in blocking buffer for 30 min at RT.\nAfter rinsing with PBS, mount the coverslips on microscope slides using Faramount mounting medium and investigate with confocal microscopy (Leica SP8, HC PL APO CS2 63×, NA 1.4, oil immersion, filter settings for DiI; excitation 551 nm, emission 565 nm and DAPI; excitation 358 nm, emission 463 nm, GFP; excitation 490 nm, emission 544 nm).\nIsolation of small extracellular vesicles from cell culture\nTiming: ∼ 3 days\nThis section describes the isolation of small extracellular vesicles from donor cell conditioned media.\nsEVs are isolated from the culture medium of recombinant cell lines expressing XP-GFP-DNAJB6b and XP-GFP.\nCritical: We recommend always making fresh sEV isolates for functional assays, including protein aggregation studies. You may store them overnight at 4°C, and use them the next day. However, do not keep them at 4°C for an extended period of time. We have observed that sEVs tend to aggregate over time. Storage of sEVs at -20°C is not recommended either because of the potential loss of functional activities.7[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7]",
    "For nonfunctional assays such as sEV marker characterization with western blotting, you may freeze the samples in loading buffer and store at -80°C. Please refer to 57–69 for further details.\nSeed 3–5 × 106 C17.2 sEV donor cells i.e., high-expression monoclonal XP-GFP and XP-GFP-DNAJB6 cells per flask in 10 T162 flasks (Corning) in 20 mL complete medium at 37°C under 5% CO2 overnight.\nThe next day, wash away the old medium with HBSS and add 20 mL exosome-depleted medium to the cells (they should be about ∼40% confluent).\n48 h later, collect the medium (∼180 mL) in 5 UC tubes (∼36 mL/tube) and isolate extracellular vesicles by sequential centrifugation as follows.\nAdd an equal amount of sterile water in 1 UC tube which will be for balancing. Weigh the tubes to balance and proceed with centrifugation -\nRemove dead cells from the supernatant by centrifugation at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C.\nCarefully transfer the supernatant to a fresh falcon tube by pipetting without touching the pellet. The procedure can be performed at RT.\nNext, centrifuge the supernatant at 2,000 g for 10 min at 4°C to remove cellular debris (Beckman Coulter, Allegra X-15R). Carefully transfer supernatants into a UC tube (38.5 mL, Certified Free Open-Top Thinwall Polypropylene Tube, 25 × 89 mm) by pipetting without touching the pellet. The procedure can be performed at RT.\nRemove apoptotic vesicles and microvesicles by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 30 min at 4°C in Sorvall Discovery 90SE UC using Beckman SW32i rotor.\nFinally, subject the resultant supernatant to ultracentrifugation at 110,000 g for 70 min at 4°C to collect sEVs.",
    "Resuspend the pellet in 5 mL of cold DPBS, transfer the suspension into a new UC (14 mL, Certified Free Open-Top Thinwall Polypropylene Tube, 14 × 95 mm) and ultracentrifuge again by ultracentrifugation at the same conditions using Beckman SW55i rotor.\nRe-suspend the final pellet in 50 μL cold DPBS, and store the sEV suspension at 4°C for downstream processing.\nCharacterization of small extracellular vesicles\nTiming: ∼ 2 days\nThis section describes how to characterize the physicochemical properties of small extracellular vesicles using nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) and western blotting for assessing the enrichment of extracellular vesicle markers.\nMeasure the protein concentration of sEV suspension with DC protein assay kit I (Bio-Rad, 5000111; https://www.bio-rad.com/en-nl/sku/5000111-dc-protein-assay-kit-i?ID=5000111[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/en-nl/sku/5000111-dc-protein-assay-kit-i?ID=5000111]).\nPerform NTA.\nDilute 1 μg and 2 μg total extracellular protein samples in 1 mL of PBS.\nUse these solutions for measuring the size of particles by NanoSight LM14 using NTA software 3.0, Malvern, Worcestershire, United Kingdom following manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.malvernpanalytical.com/en/learn/knowledge-center/user-manuals/man0511en[href=https://www.malvernpanalytical.com/en/learn/knowledge-center/user-manuals/man0511en]).\nWestern blot analysis – To ensure that the therapeutic proteins are present in the sEVs, prepare 30 μg whole cell lysates and sEV by mixing with 2× Laemmli loading buffer with SDS and protease inhibitors (Roche, 11697498001).\nBoil the samples at 90°C for 5 min. There might be some condensation on the Eppendorf lid.\nSpin down the tubes quickly and load the contents onto an SDS-PAGE gel. Run the gel at 200 V for 2 h.\nPlace the gel onto a PVDF membrane (Millipore, IPFL00010) in transfer buffer and allow for the transfer of the proteins at 500 mA for 1 h.\nBlock the membrane with Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-COR, 927-40000) for 1 h at RT.",
    "For primary antibody incubation (Lamp2b, Calnexin, DNAJB6, and GFP), in a 10 cm square petri dish, place a parafilm with the size of the blot on the inner surface of the dish.\nNote: Parafilm, because of its hydrophobicity, will prevent spreading of the liquid and keep it close to the blot.\nAdd 300–500 μL of antibody solution (prepared in odyssey blocking buffer, 1:1000) on the parafilm.\nTake out the blot from the blocking solution, cut a small piece off right corner to mark the protein side, and place the blot with the protein side facing the antibody solution i.e., facing downward.\nPlace one small wet tissue paper along the edges of the petri dish. Make sure that the tissue paper is not touching the blot, to prevent drying of the blot by capillary action.\nClose the dish, and incubate the blots overnight at 4°C.\nNext day, wash the blots with 0.1% PBS-Tween20 4 × 5 min.\nIncubate the blots with secondary antibody solution (1:5000 in blocking buffer) for 1 h at RT, following the same procedure as for primary antibody incubation.\nWash with 0.1% PBS-Tween20 4 × 5 min.\nTake out the blot from the petri dish and acquire images with an Odyssey® Infrared Imaging System (Li-COR) following manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.licor.com/bio/support/contents/applications/western-blots/fluorescent-western-blot-detection-protocol.html?Highlight=on-cell[href=http://www.licor.com/bio/support/contents/applications/western-blots/fluorescent-western-blot-detection-protocol.html?Highlight=on-cell] western assay).\nIn vitro inclusion body assay (fluorescence microscopy)\nTiming: ∼ 4 days\nThis protocol describes the procedure to make an in vitro HD cell model to assess the potency of DNAJB6-containing sEVs using fluorescence microscopy.",
    "Critical: As this is a functional assay, it is important that you use freshly isolated sEVs. We recommend seeding cells for the inclusion body assay on the day you prepare the western blot samples to check for the presence of DNAJB6 and EV markers. When their presence is confirmed, use the sEV isolates within 1–2 days.\nNote: Prewarm HBSS, trypsin, complete medium, and exosome-depleted medium.\nPlace the 13 mm glass coverslips in 24 well plate as described in 40–48.\nTrypsinize Hek293T cells, count and seed 3 × 104 cells in complete medium per well and incubate for 24 h at 37°C.\nTransfect with 200 ng pEGFP-Q74 (encoding HTT-Q74-GFP) using JetPEI® (Polyplus,10110-N) for 4 h following the manufacturer’s protocol (https://www.polyplus-transfection.com/products/jetpei/?hilite=%27jetpei%27[href=https://www.polyplus-transfection.com/products/jetpei/?hilite=%27jetpei%27]).\nRinse the cells rigorously with HBSS. HEK293T cells are easily detached from the well bottom; hence, wash multiple times but avoid cell loss.\nAdd 25 μg total sEV protein content to 500 μL of exosome-depleted medium (50 μg/mL per well) and add to the washed cells.\nIncubate cells for 36 h. Take exosome-depleted medium without sEVs as control.\nCritical: It takes >8 h post-transfection for protein expression. As DNAJB6 acts upstream of aggregation i.e., it prevents aggregate formation but does not remove existing aggregates, it is important that you add sEV solution right after the jetPEI incubation for best results. For cargo proteins acting downstream of protein aggregation, sEVs can be added later after transfection (e.g., 24 h post-transfection).\nFix cells with 4% PFA (in PBS, pH 7.4) for 10 min at RT.\nRinse with PBS and add DAPI (1 μg/mL in PBS) for 20 min at RT directly followed by rinsing (PBS).\nMount the coverslips using Faramount mounting medium (Dako, The Netherlands, S302580).",
    "Image samples using fluorescence microscopy. We used Leica DMI 6000B, HCX PL FLUOTAR L, 40× dry objective with numerical aperture 0.60. Set the excitation/emission settings to GFP (excitation 490 nm/emission 550 nm) and excitation 360 nm/emission 460 nm for DAPI.\nFor each sample, take at least 5 images from different areas randomly.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/2504-Fig5.jpg\nFigure 5. Representative image of HTT-Q74-GFP-expressing cells\nThe bright green blobs represent inclusion bodies/aggregates, some of which are indicated by a white arrow.\nNote: As the inclusion bodies show very high intensity signal, it is advisable to start with low intensity of excitation. See Figure 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig5] for reference.\nAnalysis of inclusion body numbers –\nCount the number of nuclei using ImageJ Plugins > Analyze > Cell counter. Make sure that you only count cells that have been transfected.\nCount the number of inclusion bodies using the same plugin.\nDocument all the numbers in an excel file.\nGet a ratio of the number of cells with inclusion bodies to the total number of transfected cells.\nRepeat the experiment 3 times. Draw a bar graph using Graphpad PRISM or any other software for analsysis.\nFilter trap assay for analysis of protein aggregates\nTiming: ∼ 4 days\nThis protocol explains the filter trap assay, which separates aggregated (insoluble) proteins from soluble proteins. Shortly, cell lysates (Figure 6[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig6]) are passed through the cellulose acetate membrane which traps aggregates >200 nm, separating them from soluble proteins (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]). The trapped proteins can be detected, which enables semiquantitative measurements for protein aggregation.\nPlace coverslips in 6 well plates as described in 40–48.\nTrypsinize Hek293T cells, count and seed 15 × 104 cells in complete medium per well and incubate for 24 h at 37°C.\nTransfect with 1 μg pEGFP-Q74 (encoding HTT-Q74-GFP) using JetPEI® (Polyplus,10110-N) for 4 h following the manufacturer’s protocol.",
    "Rinse the cells rigorously with HBSS. HEK293T cells are easily detached from the well bottom, hence wash multiple times but avoid cell loss.\nAdd 100 μg total sEV protein content to 1 mL of exosome-depleted medium (50 μg/mL conc. per well) and add to the washed cells. Incubate cells for 36 h. Take exosome depleted medium without sEVs as control.\nAfter incubation, rinse cells with HBSS once.\nCritical: Because of the potential risk of transfer of protein aggregates to humans, utmost care should be taken while handling samples to prevent contact. Wear gloves at all times, and work in a fume hood from this point onwards.\nAdd 400 μL of filter trap assay (FTA) buffer with SDS (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 2% SDS) per well.\nScrape the cells in each well. This will result in a very sticky mass. Transfer it to an Eppendorf carefully using 1 mL tips (200 μL tips do not transfer well enough).\nNote: Generally, cell lysates are prepared on ice. However, for filter trap assay samples, because of the presence of highly denaturing conditions such as 2% SDS, it is not required nor recommended to prepare samples on ice as this will lead to precipitation of SDS. Prepare samples at RT.\nSonicate the samples and measure protein concentration with DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, 5000111; https://www.bio-rad.com/en-nl/sku/5000111-dc-protein-assay-kit-i?ID=5000111[href=https://www.bio-rad.com/en-nl/sku/5000111-dc-protein-assay-kit-i?ID=5000111]).\nDilute the cell lysates in assay buffer to achieve 1 μg/μL of final concentration in a final volume of 285 μL.\nAdd 15 μL of 1 M DTT (MedChemExpress, HY-15917) to each sample to make the final total volume 300 μL.\nHeat the samples at 95°C for 5 min.\nNote: Same samples are used for both filter trap assay and western blotting. Remaining sample can be stored at -80°C for later use.",
    "Setting up of FTA Bio-Dot apparatus –\nOpen the Bio-Dot SF apparatus (Biorad, 1706542). Make sure it is thoroughly cleaned with water and soap.\nPrepare FTA wash buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS) and take ∼50 mL buffer in big plastic box.\nSoak 2 thick Trans-blot papers and place them on the base of the apparatus.\nSimilarly, soak 0.2 μm cellulose acetate membrane in the same buffer and place it on the trans-blot papers.\nRemove all the air bubbles by rolling a 10 mL plastic pipette on the membrane by pressing gently.\nAdd the lid of the apparatus and close the assembly by tightening the screws diagonally.\nSlowly apply full vacuum and tighten the screws further under vacuum.\nSwitch off the pump, add 200 μL FTA wash buffer and apply vacuum until all buffer goes through.\nRepeat step once. Close the vacuum.\nAdd 100 μL of the samples into each well.\nApply low vacuum very carefully and let the buffer pass through completely.\nWash the slots thrice as given in step h above.\nMake sure the buffer is completely gone.\nIn another big box, take 20 mL Odyssey Blocking buffer.\nOpen the apparatus, and remove the membrane, and place it in blocking buffer in a square petri dish for 1 h at RT on a shaker.\nRinse the blot with PBS-T and add anti-GFP antibody primary antibody solution (1:2000 in Odyssey blocking buffer) to the membrane. Incubate overnight at 4°C on a shaker.\nThe next day, wash the blot with PBS-T 4 × 10 min.\nPrepare the Odyssey secondary antibody mixture (1:5000 in Odyssey blocking buffer).\nIncubate the blot with the mix for 1 h at RT on a shaker.\nWash the blot with PBS-T 4 × 10 min.",

However, once these are boiled with the loading buffer, they can be stored at -80°C until further use. However, avoid freeze-thaw cycles until use.\nFor western blotting, take 30 μg of total protein of each sample from step 99 and follow steps 61–74 using anti-GFP antibody with the following modifications.\nAs the protein aggregates are too big to travel through running gel, they are trapped in the stacking gel. Hence, it is important to use the entire gel for transfer onto the PVDF membrane.\nThe stacking gel easily breaks during transfer, hence lift and place the gel gently on the membrane.
