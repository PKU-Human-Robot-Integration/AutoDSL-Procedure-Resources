    "1. Phantom Design\nA drawing of the preclinical multimodality phantom is shown in Figure 1 7, 8. The size of the phantom is 38 mm in diameter and 115 mm in length to allow the phantom to be scanned in various animal scanners. The phantom contains five tumor-simulating test objects (diameter: 14, 10, 7, 4 and 2 mm) placed at a depth of 10 mm within the phantom.\n2. Silicone Mold Construction\nSilicone molds are prepared to cast the tumor-simulating test objects as described in this section 7. All acrylic plates and rods required for preparation of the silicone molds are cut with an accuracy of 25 μm in the machine shop at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA).\nMake five holes (diameter: 14, 10, 7, 4, 2 mm) for test objects and another five holes (diameter: 6 mm) for alignment rods in two acrylic base plates (size: 4.2 cm × 11.5 cm × 0.9 cm) (Figure 2A).\nCut spacer pairs with height of 7, 5, 3.5, 2 and 1 mm (size: 1.0 cm × 5.5 cm) (Figure 2B).\nPrepare steel balls (diameter: 14, 10, 7, 4 and 2 mm, accuracy: 2.5 μm).\nPlace two spacer pairs with height of 7 mm and a base plate onto a thin acrylic plate in sequence and tighten them using C-clamps (Figure 2C).\nInsert the steel ball with 14 mm diameter into 14 mm hole of the base plate and glue it using J-B KWIK (Figure 2C). Repeat the procedures for the rest of the balls (Figure 2D) and for the other base plate. Note that the steel balls in two base plates are glued as mirror images 7.",
    "Attach four 2.5 cm-high acrylic plates (size: 2.5 cm × 11.5 cm for two plates and 2.5 cm × 4.2 cm for another two plates) onto each base using masking tape like fences (Figure 3A).\nAttach the top plate (size: 4.2 cm × 11.5 cm, five holes with 0.8 cm of diameter, ten holes with 1.2 cm of diameter) in one of the base plate assemblies to insert five acrylic rods (diameter: 0.8 cm and length: 0.5 cm) with 1 mm tips, and to insert five alignment rods (diameter: 0.9 cm and length: 5.0 cm) and to pour silicone (Figure 3A).\nInsert the acrylic rods into the 0.8 cm holes in the top plate all the way to the top of steel balls and glue them using silicone glue. Then insert alignment rods into the holes in the base plate through larger holes in the top plate (Figure 3A).\nMix part A of silicone rubber compound with part B in the ratio of 10 to 1 by weight.\nPour the silicone rubber compound into the assembly and dry the assembly at room temperature for about 24 hr (Figure 3B).\n3. Rotator Assembly\nThe rotator is prepared from PVC pipe and a rotisserie motor.\nGrind the end of a bolt to fit the hole of a rotisserie motor.\nScrew the ground bolt to the end of the PVC pipe (length: 270 mm and inner diameter: 75 mm) using a nut and a washer.\nBend metal plates and glue them onto a plastic plate using J-B KWIK to support the PVC pipe and to adjust the height of PVC pipe 7.\n4. TM Material Preparation",
    "The protocols for preparing the TM materials are modified from those developed in Dr. Ernest L. Madsen's laboratory at the University of Wisconsin Madison and more details are in Lee et al. 8,11.\n4.1 Background TM material preparation\nPass commercial whole milk (200 cc) through 20 μm and then 10 μm mesh filters.\nDissolve Thimerosal (0.2 g) in the filtered milk (100 cc).\nUsing house vacuum, degas this milk solution for 30 sec at room temperature.\nDissolve dry agarose (2 g) in deionized water (18 MΩ) (100 cc) at room temperature.\nThen add 1-propanol (7.9 cc) and BaSO4 (1 g) to the agarose solution.\nDegas the agarose solution and then heat it in a 95 °C water bath until the agarose solution clears.\nWhile the agarose solution clears in the 95 °C water bath, heat the condensed milk in a 55 °C water bath.\nMove the molten agarose solution to the 55 °C water bath to cool down.\nOnce both solutions are at 55 °C, mix agarose solution (50 cc) with condensed milk (50 cc) to make the ratio of 50 to 50 by volume and slowly stir the mixture followed by air bubble removal from the surface.\nThen add EDTA (0.103 g) and CuCl2·2H2O (0.06 g) to the agarose-milk mixture followed by sufficient stirring to ensure homogeneity.\nLastly, add glass beads (15 - 60 μm diameter, mean diameter: 35 μm) (0.1 g) and stir the final mixture repeatedly. Prior to use, soak the glass beads in concentrated nitric acid for 24 hr to remove any impurities and then rinse off the acid.\n4.2 Test object TM material preparation\nThe test object TM material is prepared in a similar manner as the background TM material except for the following compositional differences:",
    "Pass commercial whole milk (20 cc) through 20 μm and then 10 μm mesh filters.\nDissolve Thimerosal (0.02 g) in the filtered milk (10 cc).\nDissolve dry agarose (0.60 g) in a room temperature solution of deionized water (10 cc) and 1-propanol (0.79 cc).\nDegas the agarose solution and then heat it in a 95 °C water bath until the agarose solution clears.\nWhile the agarose solution clears in the 95 °C water bath, heat the condensed milk in a 55 °C water bath.\nMove the molten agarose solution to the 55 °C water bath.\nOnce both solutions are at 55 °C, mix the agarose solution (5 cc) with condensed milk (5 cc) and slowly stir the mixture followed by air bubble removal from the surface.\nThen add EDTA (0.0017 g) and CuCl2·2H2O (0.0010 g) to the agarose-milk followed by sufficient stirring.\n5. Multimodality Phantom Assembly\nUsing the silicone molds, the following steps are accomplished to construct the multimodality phantom.\nOn the silicone mold without 1 mm holes, attach nylon thread along the center of spheres and glue it at both ends of the mold using silicone glue (Figure 4A).\nUsing a soft brush, apply silicone grease on the surface of two molds (Figure 4A) and assemble two molds using alignment rods.\nPrepare test object TM material as described in section 4.2 and pour it through 1 mm holes of the silicone mold using a 22-gauge needle of a syringe.\nTo allow the test objects to set, store the molds in a refrigerator (5 °C) for about 30 min.",
    "In each side of a half-cylindrical container (length: 115 mm and diameter: 38 mm), make two holes of 1 mm at a depth of 10 mm from the phantom surface in order to mount nylon thread with test objects. Make an additional hole of 6 mm to pour background TM material.\nUnload the test objects with nylon thread from the molds (Figure 4B) and then mount them in the half-cylindrical container (Figure 4C).\nUsing 3M Scotch-Weld DP-100 and 3M duct tape, adhere thin non-conducting aluminum (thickness: 0.12 mm) onto the acrylic container. Block the 1 mm holes in the acrylic container using the same glue (Figure 4C).\nPrepare background TM material quickly and slowly pour it into the 6 mm hole of the container using a small plastic funnel.\nAfter removal of any air bubbles, glue the 6 mm hole using 3M Scotch-Weld DP-100.\nOnce assembled, rotate the phantom at 2 rpm in the rotator for 4 to 5 hr at room temperature.\nRemove the nylon thread after the TM materials in the phantom completely hardens.\n6. Multimodality Imaging\nThe phantom is scanned in preclinical ultrasound, CT and MRI and images in three modalities are acquired. The imaging protocols are described in detail in Lee et al.  7, 8.Subscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
