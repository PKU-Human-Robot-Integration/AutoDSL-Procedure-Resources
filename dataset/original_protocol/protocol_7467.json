    "Prepare mouse testicular lysate C57BL/6N male mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation and the testes were collected after abdominal anatomy (see also Note 4).Use tweezers to peel off the tunica albuginea covering the surface of the testis.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4686/bioprotoc-13-11-4686-g001.jpgFigure 1. Schematic diagram illustrating the tunica albuginea's location and shape and remaining testicular tissues Weigh the testicular tissues and transfer them to a pre-cooled Dounce homogenizer (see Note 4).Homogenize the testicular tissues with lysis buffer (1 mL per 100 mg of testes) by 10–15 strokes.Transfer homogenate to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and incubate on ice for 15 min.Centrifuge at 13,000× g for 2 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant to a fresh 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube on ice.Prepare sucrose gradient Mark the ultra-clear centrifuge tube with the marker block provided by Biocomp and place it in the MagnaBase holder.Add 10% sucrose up to the marker line with a 20 mL syringe.Then, add an equal volume of 60% sucrose at the bottom of the tube with a fresh syringe.Apply the short cap provided by Biocomp and remove the excess solution.Turn on the Biocomp Gradient Station and level the rotating platform using a round bubble level.Place the MagnaBase holder in the center of the plate.Select the pre-programmed 10%–60% (w/v) gradients and press USE.The station will beep when finished. Sucrose gradients should be used immediately.Isolate polysome fractions from the total lysate Take 10% of the lysates prepared in section A to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, add 500 μL of RNAiso Plus, and mix samples well. Label this sample as TOTAL and store it at -20 °C, or extract RNA following the procedure in section D.Fill the tube prepared in section B with residual lysates.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4686/bioprotoc-13-11-4686-g002.jpgFigure 2.",
    "Loading of lysates on sucrose gradients Centrifuge the gradient at 38,000× g for 2 h at 4 °C in an SW41 Ti rotor.After ultracentrifugation, gently remove tubes from the rotor and collect 12 fractions with Piston Gradient Fractionator.Start the Gradient Station Fractionator and clean the upper valve assembly and the collection tubing.Insert the centrifuge tube into the tube holder and lock it in.Place the tube holder on the fractionator and turn it back 90° to lock it.Cut out the cap of 2 mL Eppendorf tubes and place them onto the Fraction Collector.Open the software, select the user profile, and zero the detector.After blanking, press the AIR button according to the operation manual to force air through the entire system until no liquid comes out at the end of the collection tubing.Run the fractionator and collect 12 fractions. The system will plot the absorbance in real time as the sample passes through the flow cell. Export data following software instructions.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/e4686/bioprotoc-13-11-4686-g003.jpgFigure 3. An absorbance graph generated by Biocomp Gradient Maker and Fractionator Transfer 700 μL of each fraction to a new 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, add 500 μL of RNAiso Plus, and mix samples well. Label these samples as FRT#1–12 and store them at -20 °C, or extract RNA following the procedure in section D.Extract polysome RNAs Vortex for 10 s and keep the homogenate at room temperature for 5 min.Centrifuge at 13,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Transfer the supernatant to a new centrifuge tube and add 100 μL of chloroform.Vortex for 10–15 s and keep at room temperature for 5 min.Centrifuge at 13,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C.Transfer the upper layer to a new centrifuge tube.Add one volume of isopropanol and keep it at room temperature for at least 10 min.",
    "Centrifuge at 13,000× g for 15 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and wash the RNA precipitate with 1 mL of pre-cooled 75% ethanol.Centrifuge at 13,000× g for 5 min at 4 °C.Remove the supernatant and keep the RNA precipitate air dried.Dissolve the RNA precipitate with an appropriate amount of preheated nuclease-free water (see Note 5).High-throughput sequencing According to the absorbance graph, combine the RNA solutions extracted from polysome fractions (usually FRT#6–12 or FRT#7–12) and label it as POLY.Subject comparable TOTAL and POLY RNAs to high-throughput sequencing with the Illumina platform (performed by Novogene Co, Ltd). Briefly, the concentration and purity of extracted RNAs were checked using Nanodrop and agarose gel electrophoresis, and integrity was further determined using Agilent 2100. Then, the libraries were constructed using NEBNext® UltraTM RNA Library Prep kit for Illumina®."
