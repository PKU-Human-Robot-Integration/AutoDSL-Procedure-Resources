    "NOTE: One mouse yields sufficient myoblasts for approximately two 35 mm dishes or two live-imaging dishes, so plan mattings, dissection, and coating (step 2.6) accordingly. Since myoblasts are isolated through sequential centrifugations and preplating, the protocol should be done in batches of 5 - 10 animals.\nAll procedures involving animal subjects were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee at Instituto de Medicina Molecular and University Pierre et Marie Curie \n1. Dissection of Neonatal Mice Hind-limb Muscles\nPrepare all solutions in advance (Materials Table) and sterilize by filtration (0.22 µm filter). Make sure all media are at 37 °C before addition to the cells, except the formulations containing basement membrane matrix (e.g., Matrigel).\nSterilize the dissection material (one each of: curved scissors, straight scissors, regular forceps, and fine-tip forceps) and the work bench by wiping them with 70% ethanol.\nPrepare a 100 mm Petri dish with 5 mL of Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS) for muscle collection and keep it on ice until the mincing step.\nDecapitate P6 - P8 mice with straight scissors and sterilize the skin with 70% ethanol.\nMake an incision in the back skin and pull it gently towards the hind limbs until it is removed, completely exposing the hind-limb musculature.\nUse the forceps to remove fat tissue without damaging the muscles.\nTo remove the dorsal hind-limb muscles, keep the limb stretched and bend the paw to expose the heel tendons. Use the curved scissors to separate muscle from bone, starting from the tendons, by gently sliding and cutting upwards. Excise the muscles and place them in iced DPBS.\nIsolate the quadriceps by pinching the muscle with fine-tip forceps and cutting around it without damaging the femur or the knee joint.",
    "After dissecting all animals, proceed to a sterile laminar flow cell culture hood, where all the following steps should be performed.\n2. Myoblast Isolation\nRemove the excess of DPBS. Mince the tissue with sterilized curved scissors in order to obtain a uniform mass.\nCollect the minced tissue in a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube using 5 mL of digestion mix and incubate it with agitation at 37 °C for 90 min.\nStop the digestion by adding 6 mL of dissection medium and centrifuge the suspension for 5 min at 75 x g to pellet the remaining tissue.\nCarefully collect the supernatant. Make sure to not collect tissue debris. Centrifuge it at 350 x g for 5 min; resuspend it in 5 mL of dissection medium.\nFilter the cell suspension through a 40 µm cell strainer. Add 25 mL of dissection medium and preplate it in a 150 mm dish for 4 h in a cell culture incubator (37 °C and 5% CO2) to allow the fibroblasts to adhere.\nWhile preplating, coat dishes with 500 µL of basement membrane matrix diluted 1:100 in cold IMDM for 1 h at RT. Wash once with DPBS and plate the cells immediately (step 2.8) or leave with growth medium until plating.\nAfter preplating, collect the supernatant and centrifuge it at 350 x g for 10 min.\nResuspend it in growth medium and count the cells on a hemocytometer. Adjust the volume so that between 150,000 and 250,000 cells are plated per basement membrane matrix-coated dish. Keep the cells in a cell culture incubator.\n3. Myofiber Differentiation\nNOTE: After 3 d, the cells should start to fuse and form myotubes at around 70% confluency (Figure 1B).",
    "At this point, transfect the cells, if desired, with a siRNA or DNA of interest. If the cells are not to be transfected, change directly to differentiation medium and skip to step 3.4.\nTransfect with transfection reagents following the manufacturer's instructions. Incubate the cells for 5 h with siRNA-lipid complexes (20 nM + 1 µL of reagent) or DNA-lipid complexes (1 µg + 1 µL of reagent). Optimize the siRNA and DNA concentrations if necessary.\nWash them once with differentiation medium and then switch to new differentiation medium.\nThe following day, dilute the basement membrane matrix 1:2 in ice-cold differentiation medium. Remove the existing medium and add 200 µL of ice-cold matrix to each dish.\nIncubate for 30 min in a cell culture incubator.\nSupplement the differentiation medium with agrin (100 ng/mL) and carefully add 2 mL to the cells.\nCarefully change half of the medium every 2 d, always supplementing with agrin to a final concentration of 100 ng/µL.\nMonitor cell differentiation and viability. Depending on a variety of factors (such as FBS and chicken embryo extract origins), the cells might take between 5 - 10 differentiation d to reach full maturation (Figure 2).\n4. Immunostaining in Glass-bottom Dishes\nFor immunostaining, at any time-point of interest, wash the cells once with DPBS and fix them with 4% PFA at RT for 10 min.\nWash them twice with DPBS. At this point, the cells can be stored at 4 °C.\nPermeabilize them with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min at RT.\nWash them twice with PBS and block with blocking solution for 30 min at RT.\nIncubate them with primary antibody diluted in blocking solution O/N at 4 °C.\nWash 3x with DPBS for 5 min at RT.",
    "Incubate them with the secondary antibody and 0.2 µg/mL of DAPI for 1 h at RT.\nWash 3x with DPBS for 5 min at RT.\nAdd 200 µL of mounting medium and proceed to imaging."
