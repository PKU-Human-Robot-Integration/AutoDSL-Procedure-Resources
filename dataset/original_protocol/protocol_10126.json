Assemble PEG-bl­-PPS Nanocarriers via Hand-Powered Flash Nanoprecipitation\n(Optional) Sterilize the confined impingement jets (CIJ) mixer.",
    "Within a biological safety cabinet (BSC), submerge mixer with all parts disassembled within 0.1 M NaOH overnight.\nReassemble CIJ mixer, and flow through endotoxin-free water using luer-lock syringes.\nTest the pH of the water, and continue to flow water through until pH registers as neutral.\nDissolve PEG17-bl-PPS35-SH polymer and hydrophobic cargo in THF (impingement solution 1).\n\t\nWeigh 20 mg of PEG17-bl-PPS35-SH into a 1.5 mL tube.\nAdd hydrophobic dyes (e.g.,DiI, ICG), drugs (e.g.,rapamycin), or other cargo.\n\t\tNote: Cargo may be dry, or dissolved in a water-miscible solvent, preferably THF. If cargo is insoluble in THF or DMF, another water-miscible solvent may be used, but sparingly, as the polymer is unlikely to be soluble. The amount of cargo that can be loaded is dependent on the cargo properties itself (e.g., the molecular weight, the hydrophobicity, steric considerations), and should be explored on a case-by-case basis11,12.\nAdd 500 µL of 100% THF to the polymer and cargo, vortex vigorously to dissolve.\nDissolve hydrophilic cargo in aqueous buffer (impingement solution 2). For this, dissolve hydrophilic cargo to be loaded within polymer vesicles in 500 µL of an aqueous buffer (e.g., phosphate-buffered saline, pure water, etc.) as needed.\nAdd buffer to reservoir.\n\t\nAdd 2.5 mL of an aqueous buffer of choice (e.g., 1x phosphate buffered saline) to a suitably sized reservoir (e.g., a 20 mL glass scintillation vial). Place reservoir under CIJ mixer such that the outflow from the mixer directly enters the reservoir.\nLoad impingement solutions into separate 1 mL plastic disposable syringes.\nImpinge solutions against each other to simultaneously form nanostructures and load them with the payload.\n\t\nInsert syringes into Luer-lock adapters at the top of the CIJ mixer.\nIn a single, smooth, and rapid motion, depress both syringes simultaneously and with equal force.",
    "Note: If performing multiple sequential impingements, first collect outflow in an empty reservoir.\n(Optional) Perform multiple impingements. Split nascent nanostructure solution between two syringes, and repeat steps 2.6.1-2.6.2 up to 4 more times.\nCollect outflow in the aqueous buffer-filled reservoir prepared in 2.4.1 and gently stir to ensure mixing.\nRemove unloaded cargo and organic solvent.\n\t\n(Option 1) Dialyze nanocarrier formulation in the same aqueous buffer used for impingement and in the reservoir, using tubing of an appropriate MW cutoff for at least 24 hours with at least 2 buffer changes. This can be performed at room temperature.\n\t\tNote: Nanocarriers will be retained by tubing with a MW cutoff <100,000 kDa and may potentially be retained by higher cutoffs as well. This option maintains sterility when performed in a BSC using sterile buffer.\n(Option 2) Filter formulation through a size exclusion or desalting/buffer exchange column (e.g., Sepharose 6B column) using 1x PBS as the aqueous buffer.\n\t\tNote: This option maintains sterility when performed in a BSC with a column that has been thoroughly sterilized.\n(Option 3) Remove volatile organic solvent using vacuum desiccation overnight.\n(Option 4) Filter formulation using a tangential flow filtration system using a 50-100 kDa filter at a 20-60 mL/min flow rate for 15 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the molecular weight of the unencapsulated cargo being purified away (larger cargo will take longer).\n(Optional) Concentrate the nanocarrier formulation.\n\t\n(Option 1) Concentrate using a spin concentrator system (e.g., spin column with MW cutoff > 100,000), used as described by manufacturer.\n\t\tNote: Nanocarriers may need to be resuspended between spins and may require a number of spins to concentrate down to desired volume. Spin concentration may reduce sterility of nanocarrier formulations.\n(Option 2) Reduce volume using vacuum desiccation.",
    "Note: Volume change is difficult to control under these conditions, and care must be taken to maintain osmolarity before and after concentration.\nStore nanocarriers at 4 °C for weeks to months. Prior to use after storage, briefly vortex nanocarrier formulations.\n3. Characterize Nanocarrier Formulations\nMeasure loading efficiency\nIf cargo is fluorescent or absorbs strongly at a given wavelength outside of 260-450 nm, measure fluorescence/absorbance using a fluorimeter/spectrophotometer.\n\t\tNote: PEG-bl-PPS absorbs strongly from 260-310 nm and polymersome formulations absorb from 310-450 nm, which may complicate quantification of cargo that absorbs at a similar wavelength.\nIf cargo absorbs within the 260-450 nm range and is hydrophilic, disrupt PEG-bl-PPS nanostructures by adding 25 μL of the formulation to an equal volume of either 1% H2O2 or 1% Triton X-100 and subsequently separate and distinguish cargo from polymer absorbance via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a size exclusion column compatible with aqueous buffers (e.g., a Sepharose 6B column) 11.\nIf cargo absorbs within the 260-450 nm range and is soluble in THF or DMF, lyophilize the formulation by freezing 100 μL in a 1.5 mL plastic tube at -80 °C overnight. Then place the tube into a glass vacuum container and place onto a lyophilizer. Allow 24 hours for lyophilization to occur and subsequently re-dissolve in 50 μL of DMF or THF prior to separation and detection via HPLC.\nMeasure nanocarrier size and morphology\nUse dynamic light scattering (DLS)11 or nanoparticle tracking analysis13 to measure nanocarrier size.\n\t\tNote: Nanocarriers formed from PEG17-bl-PPS35-SH are expected to have an average diameter between 100-200 nm, with a polydispersity index < 0.3.\nDetermine nanocarrier morphology using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM)14.\n\t\tNote: Nanocarriers formed from PEG17-bl-PPS35-SH are expected to be polymer vesicles (polymersomes) with a clearly discernable polymeric membrane and largely spherical shape.\n(Optional) Test formulations for endotoxin",
    "(Option 1) Use a cell-based assay for the presence of endotoxin, e.g., RAW Blue cells or HEK Blue TLR4 cells (see Table of Materials), as described by manufacturer, in either a quantitative or qualitative assay for lipopolysaccharides (LPS)13.\n(Option 2) Use a Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL)15 assay kit, as described by the manufacturer.\n4.

    "Note: Software for operating the Instrument is available upon request. Instrument software source code available upon request. Upon receiving zipped file, download all dependencies specified in the README file. This software includes a simple graphic user interface that enables control over instrument operation, including basic run parameters (motor speed, direction, etc.). Users are encouraged to expand on the existing source code and program custom modules tailored for use in their own experiments. All software was written using Python 2.7.12 and is not currently compatible with Python 3. RPi, PicoBorgRev, kivy, and multiprocessing modules are utilized. The README file contains detailed information regarding the software distribution license.\nInstall a 24 V brushed DC motor (Figure 5A) and precision slide (4.5” (114.3 mm) stroke; 1.27 mm screw lead) (Figure 5C).\n\tNote: The 24 V DC motor used here has a RPMmax, Imax, and full-load torque of 4,252 RPM, 4.83 A, and ~0.2 N*m, respectively.\n\t\n(Optional) Place padding underneath the motor to dampen vibration during operation.\n\t\tNote: It is recommended that a 2-3 mm thick rubber pad is cut to fit the motor carriage dimensions of the instrument base.\nMount the precision slide to the instrument base.\n\t\t\nRemove the threaded rod temporarily.\nMount slide using two #8-32 flat machine screws.\nMount DC motor to precision slide using screw beam coupling (1-1/4” length) containing 6/16” and 1/4” diameter bores.\n\t\tNote: Depending on the thickness of acrylic used to machine the instrument base layers, shims may be needed to level the motor and precision slide shafts.\nAssemble expulsion platform from metal plates and L-shaped corner braces (Figure 5D). Mount base metal platform to sliding platform (attached to threaded rod) using #6-32 screws. See precision slide schematic provided by manufacturer for details regarding the mounting constraints.\nAssemble syringe expulsion system setup.",
    "Attach linear motion pillow blocks (mounting platforms + linear motion bearing) onto M8 chrome-plated stainless-steel rails (the parallel steel rails can be readily observed in Figure 5).\nThread rails through linear shaft guide/support and lock rails. Use three guides per rail. Mount SE parts 1 and 2 onto pillow blocks using M4 machine screws.\nLoosely join SE parts 1 and 2 with M8 hex bolts. Configure the space between SE part 1 and 2 with helical compression springs covering each bolt that are secured between two inward facing nylon bushings (see Figure 5F). Mount these bushings on the exterior of the SE part 1 and SE part 2.\nWire circuit (see Figure 6 for the core wiring diagram)\n\t\nConnect the motor controller to the I2C/SDA, 3.3 V, and GND pins on the single board computer.\nConnect DC motor terminals to the M- and M+ blocks of the motor controller board. Connect the 24 V, 2.5 A power supply (Figure 5B) to the V+ and GND blocks of the motor controller (the controller is encased in a simple electronics box in the final design, see Figure 5H).\nConnect the 3V3 and 5V pins of the motor control board to the respective pins on the single board computer. Connect SDA and SCL pins of the motor controller to pins 3 and 5 of the single board computer, respectively.",
    "Note: Commands are issued to the DC motor from the single board computer through a motor controller. Motor speed is controlled by regulating the voltage across the motor terminals via pulse width modulation. In this setup, the maximum current running through the 24 V DC motor (full-load amperage: 4.83 A) is limited to 2.5 A by the 24 V power supply. It is recommended that the motor circuit is wired through a normally-closed (NC) emergency stop (Figure 5J). Doing so provides a means to disrupt the motor circuit to enable a basic emergency shutdown operation.\nConnect front and rear infrared proximity sensors (digital distance sensors, Figure 5I) to RPi GPIO pins 24 and 23, respectively.\n\t\t\nRoute sensor wiring through conduits in the instrument base.\n\t\t\tNote: The IR sensors are non-contact break-beam motion sensors with a detection range of 2-10 cm.\n4.7.4.2 Snap the wired IR sensors into 3D-printed infrared sensor braces (Figure 5I, black boxes) and mount onto the instrument base. When correctly set into the brace, the sensor face should protrude outwards from the 14 mm x 7 mm rectangular opening of the brace.\n\t\t\tNote: these sensor braces can be temporarily mounted using Velcro or an adhesive (temporary mounting is useful to appropriately adjust and optimize IR sensor placement). Alternatively, permanently mount by drilling small guide holes in the instrument base and securing the braces with M2 screws.\nConnect a 7” touchscreen LCD display to the 5V, GND, and display serial interface (DSI) pins of the single board computer. The 7” RPi and LCD display assembly is shown in Figure 5G.\n5. Fabricate Polymersomes via FNP Using the Custom-Made High-Speed Syringe Pump\n(Option 1) Use auto run mode.",
    "Select Auto Run from the main menu. The system will prompt users to allow the motor to automatically position the syringe expulsion platform to the beginning of the precision slide. Ensure that the path in front of and behind the metal plate is clear prior to proceeding.\nLoad 1 mL plastic syringes as described in section 2.5 and mount syringes onto the female Luer connectors of the CIJ mixer. Load CIJ mixer (with syringes attached) into the rectangular opening of the rear expulsion carriage (see Figure 5E).\nSet the desired motor speed (units: rpm) by using the slider in the GUI (see note below for important considerations). The optimal motor speed will depend on the specific pump and setup but must ensure a flow rate of at least 1 mL/s for the CIJ mixer channel dimensions provided here.",
    "Note: Consider the following while setting flow rate. In the vertical hand-operated FNP configuration, reactants are expelled from the syringes at a rate of ~1 mL/s, but can be highly variable when hand driven. This is simply the flow rate through the syringe barrel, which is controlled by the rate at which the user advances the syringe plunger. Note that the 1 mL/s rate is not referring to the exit flow rate from the smaller diameter nozzle. At the above specified channel dimensions, ~1 mL/s should be maintained to ensure an appropriate Reynold’s number for turbulent mixing10. Different flow rates can be used as long as the channel diameter is adjusted accordingly to maintain a Reynold’s number that supports turbulent conditions. The syringe plungers are advanced by a perpendicular metal plate, which moves along a high-precision aluminum slide coupled to the 24 V brushed DC motor. In this configuration, the maximum barrel flow rate is influenced by a number of factors, including (1) the maximum motor speed (4,252 rpm) and the screw lead of the precision slide (1.27 mm) that is coupled to the motor shaft (2) the torque of the motor (~0.2 N*m of full-load torque), which is needed to overcome resistance to flow (3) back pressure contributions from fluid entry into and exit from the CIJ mixer, and (4) the strength of the syringes used (users should be mindful of the forces acting on the syringes, and use syringes of appropriate strength). Regarding point (2), when increasing flow rate sufficient torque is required to avoid stalling the motor while maintaining steady expulsion under increasing back pressure. Barrel flow rates – to illustrate the barrel flow rate that the aforementioned system can achieve, consider the case where FNP is performed using reactants loaded into two one-milliliter syringes.",
    "To achieve a 1 mL/s flow rate through the barrel, the motor must advance the metal plate the distance defined by the plunger length (~68 mm for a typical one mL syringe) in one second. Provided the 1.27 mm screw lead of the precision slide, it follows that a DC motor operating at 4,252 rpm is capable of advancing the platform up to ~90 mm/s (71 rev/s*1.27 mm/rev). This corresponds to a barrel flow rate of ~1.3 mL/s, which exceeds the 1 mL/s target rate.",
    "Prior to running the instrument, check the system to ensure the that the path of the platform is clear of obstructions, and that the front and rear IR proximity detectors are clear of obstructions (the IR sensors are the small black boxes near the precision slide terminals; see Figure 5I). Also ensure that the capillary tubing outlet from the CIJ mixer is routed into an appropriate collection container (ex: glass beaker, etc.).\nTo expel reactants from the syringes and into the CIJ mixer, press the Run button in the software interface.\n(Option 2) Use manual run mode. Refer to the Auto Run Mode directions above and note the following change to step 5.1.5: press the forward button pressed continuously through the completion of the run (i.e., the platform advances in response to an on-press event, and the motor will stop in response to an on-release event).\n(Option 3) Use manual platform positioning mode; this mode allows users to position the platform by running the motor at low speed (20% power) in response to the forward and reverse buttons on the software interface.\nSubscription Required.
