    "The following protocol describes how to thaw, passage, and maintain hPSCs before inducing organoid differentiation. This step is necessary to ensure that the starting population is healthy, stable, and homogeneous, without spontaneously differentiated areas. hPSC cultures should also be routinely tested for mycoplasma contamination. We recommend performing one or two passages before organoid differentiation, which can take approximately 6 to 10 days depending on the chosen stem cell line and seeding density. The protocol presented here is based on culturing hPSCs on human recombinant Lam-521-coated plates and iPS-Brew medium, which results in a homogeneous cell culture while preserving pluripotency and self-renewal properties (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-fig-0002] and 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-fig-0002]). The protocol could also be adapted to use Matrigel coating but, in that case, we recommend monitoring the quality of hPSC cultures to be alert to the presence of areas of spontaneous differentiation, which should be manually removed.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3d613bc0-5171-48e2-80e2-7be603ae7d87/cpz1555-fig-0002-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 2\nVentral midbrain (VM) organoid differentiation protocol.

    "1. Prepare a solution of Lam-521 (0.5 µg/cm2) in PBS (+Ca2+/+Mg2+) (coating solution).\n2. Coat one well of a 6-well plate with 2 ml/well of the coating solution. Then, gently shake the plate to ensure a homogeneous distribution of the solution and incubate for at least 2 hr (overnight preferred) at 37°C.\nFollowing this protocol, one well of a 6-well plate yields enough hPSCs to generate 100 organoids. In case a different amount is needed, adjust the number of wells accordingly.\nPlates can be prepared in advance: wrap in Parafilm and store for up to a week at 4°C. If the plates are to be stored for more than 48 hr at 4°C, increase the volume of the coating solution to 3 ml to make sure the wells do not dry out. Before use, incubate the plate at 37°C for at least 2 hr.\n3. Before starting the procedure, prepare 5 ml of wash medium (5% KOSR [v/v] in DMEM/F-12) in a 15-ml tube.\n4. Thaw the cells in the automated thawing system or in a water bath at 37°C until approximately half of the medium has thawed.\nTake care not to submerge the tube.\n5. Add 1 ml wash medium to the cryovial dropwise, making sure to collect all the cells from the walls of the vial.\nThis and all following steps should be performed in sterile conditions in the cell hood.\n6. Transfer the cells to the remaining 4 ml of wash medium (step 3) and centrifuge the tube at 400 × g for 5 min at room temperature (RT).\n7. Remove the supernatant and gently knock the tube to detach the pellet from the bottom.\n8. Resuspend the cells in 1 ml iPS-Brew medium supplemented with Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor, 10 µM final concentration).",
    "9. Count the cells with an automated counter (e.g., Countess II) or a Bürker chamber.\n10. Plate cells homogeneously onto Lam-521-coated plates at a density of 15,000 cells/cm2 (approx. 144,000 cells/well for a 6-well plate). Add iPS-Brew medium supplemented with Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor, 10 µM final concentration), to reach a final volume of 2 ml/well.\n11. After 24 hr, replace the stem cell medium with 2 ml/well fresh iPS-Brew medium without the Y-27632 supplement.\n12. For culture maintenance, replace the stem cell medium every day with fresh iPS-Brew medium.\nDuring the weekend, twice the amount of medium can be added to the cells to avoid having to change the medium for one extra day.\nPassaging of hPSC line\n13. Prepare 5 ml of wash medium (5% KOSR [v/v] in DMEM/F-12) in a 15-ml tube and Lam-521-coated plates before starting, as described in steps 1-3.\n14. Aspirate hPSC medium and wash the cells from step 11 once in 2 ml/well D-PBS −Ca2+/−Mg2+, to remove dead cells and debris.\n15. Add 0.5 mM EDTA (50 µl/cm2, e.g., 500 µl/well for a 6-well plate) directly to the cells and incubate at 37°C for 7 min.\n16. Remove the EDTA, then detach the cells by adding 1.5 ml/well wash medium. Using a 1000-µl pipette, quickly but gently triturate the colony into small clumps, without introducing bubbles.\n17. Transfer all cells to the tube containing the remaining wash medium and centrifuge at 400 × g for 5 min at RT.\n18. Aspirate the supernatant and detach the pellet from the bottom by gently knocking the tube.\n19. Resuspend the cells in 1 ml of iPS-Brew medium supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632.\n20. Count the cells with an automated counter (e.g., Countess II) or a Bürker chamber.",
    "21. Plate cells homogeneously onto Lam-521-coated wells on iPS-Brew supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632 with the aim of having 70% confluency on the day of hPSC differentiation.\nFor the hPSC line RC17, approximate recommended seeding densities are: 3 days before seeding, 25k cells/cm2; 4 days before seeding, 15k cells/cm2; 5 days before seeding, 10k cells/cm2.\nNote that different cell lines might have different growth rates and seeding densities might need to be adjusted accordingly.\n22. After 24 hr, replace the stem cell medium with fresh iPS-Brew without the Y-27632 supplement.\n23. For culture maintenance, replace the stem cell medium every 1-2 days with iPS-Brew, as described above.\n24. Proceed to Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-prot-0002] when cells have reached 70% to 75% confluency.",
    "This protocol describes how to guide the self-organization of the hPSCs in Basic Protocol 1[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-prot-0001] into VM-patterned organoids. The cells are first plated in conical wells to favor cell aggregation leading to the formation of embryonic bodies. Cells are then cultured under undifferentiated conditions for 3 days (day -3 to day 0). At day 0, once the cells have aggregated, the culture medium is switched to differentiation medium, which includes the addition of the following extrinsic patterning factors to efficiently drive hPSCs into VM organoids: dual-SMAD inhibitors, ventralizing agent SHH-C24II, GSK3 inhibitor (CHIR99021), and fibroblast growth factor 8b (FGF8b) (Fig. 2A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-fig-0002] and 2B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-fig-0002] and Fig. 3A[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-fig-0003]-E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-fig-0003]). The proper balancing and timing of the different patterning factors used during differentiation is crucial.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4e6eda4d-754f-4e1d-8d28-a9dd89e832d7/cpz1555-fig-0003-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 3",

Expression values were obtained from RT-qPCR analysis and presented as fold change over undifferentiated hPSCs (Log10) normalized over ACTB and GAPDH expression levels.",
    "This protocol has been tested on multiple hPSC and induced PSC (iPSC) lines with similar results. However, the concentration of CHIR99021 may need to be optimized, as different cell lines exhibit slightly different sensitivities to this patterning factor. CHIR99021 titration is required to identify the optimal condition for efficient VM patterning (Fig. 3F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-fig-0003]). During differentiation, when the VM organoids have grown in size, they require scaffolding to support the 3D structure. Matrigel, a natural matrix material resembling the extracellular matrix, strengthens the organization of the organoids in a 3D culture space. The organoids are embedded in Matrigel droplets at day 14 of VM differentiation to enhance organoid architecture and obtain high-order brain functions. Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-prot-0002] can be followed to generate VM organoids containing functionally mature and pigmented DA neurons (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-fig-0004]), which can then be used for biomedical applications as well as for PD disease modeling.\n<p>imgsrc:https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6e18b5d2-8813-404e-927f-46e1cb2b48cf/cpz1555-fig-0004-m.jpg</p>\nFigure 4\nAnalysis of neuromelanin production during VM organoid differentiation.

Prepare 5 ml wash medium (5% KOSR [v/v] in DMEM/F-12) in a 15-ml tube.\n3. Aspirate hPSC medium and wash the cells once in 2 ml/well of D-PBS −Ca2+/−Mg2+.\n4. Incubate the cell culture with Accutase solution (50 µl/cm2, e.g., 500 µl/well for a 6-well plate) at 37°C for 5 min.\n5. Without removing the Accutase solution, gently add 1.5 ml wash medium to each well to detach the cells, using a 1000 µl pipette to mechanically obtain small cell clumps and single cells.\n6.

    "11. Gently add 200 µl/well of iPS-Brew supplemented with 10 µM Y-27632 (total volume 250 µl/well) and leave the plate undisturbed in the incubator.\n12. After 48 hr (day –1), replace 150 µl of medium with 200 µl of fresh iPS-Brew without the Y-27632 supplement.\nThis step should be performed carefully to avoid aspirating the cells.\n13. Wait 24 hr before proceeding to the next step.\nEmbryoid body formation and patterning (days 0 to 14)\n14. Prepare N2 base medium supplemented with 10 nM SB431542, 150 ng/ml Noggin, 1.5 µM CHIR99021, and 400 ng/ml SHH-C24II.\n15. Gently replace 200 µl/well medium with the N2 medium.\nThe culture can be very fragile at this stage as the embryoid bodies are forming. Make sure to remove the medium gently. All supplement factors should be freshly added at every medium exchange. The CHIR99021 concentration indicated here is optimal for differentiation of the hPSC RC17 line and has been previously tested through titration. The optimal concentrations among those tested with other hPSC lines are indicated in Figure 3F[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-fig-0003].\n16. Replace 250 µl/well with N2 medium and fresh supplements (as above) on days 2, 4, and 6.\n17. On day 8, replace 250 µl/well with N2 medium supplemented with fresh 100 ng/ml FGF8b.\n18.

On day 13, before starting the embedding procedure, let the Matrigel thaw undisturbed overnight at 2°-8°C in a bucket of ice.",
    "It is crucial that the temperature of the Matrigel remains low (around 4°C), as Matrigel proteins start to polymerize at higher temperatures, and, under those conditions, the reagent will not be suitable for the embedding procedure.\n20. On day 14, take a support surface with holes arranged horizontally and vertically (e.g., a 96-well plate), coat the surface with a Parafilm layer, and apply finger pressure to generate dimples. Sterilize the dimples with UV/ethanol.\n21. Using a cut P1000 tip, transfer the embryoid bodies from the corresponding well to individual dimples in a small drop of medium.\nEmbryoid bodies at this stage are visible to the naked eye and should appear as round spheres when observed under a microscope.\n22. With a P200 tip, remove as much medium as possible from the surroundings of each 3D culture.\nIf a large number of organoids are embedded at the same time, work quickly to ensure they do not dry out.\n23. Evenly cover each embryoid body with a droplet of Matrigel (∼30 µl/organoid).\nWork quickly during the procedure and keep the Matrigel on ice to avoid polymerization.\n24. Incubate the plate at 37°C for 30 min.\n25. After embedding, transfer the organoids to an ultra-low attachment 6-well plate, at approximately 10 organoids/well. To facilitate the transfer, detach the Parafilm from the support and wash out the embedded organoids with 300 µl/dimple of B27 base medium supplemented with fresh 20 ng/ml BDNF, 10 ng/ml GDNF, 200 µM ascorbic acid, 500 µM cAMP, and 1 µM DAPT. Once all organoids are transferred to the corresponding wells, add medium to reach a final volume of 4 ml/well.",
    "26. For terminal differentiation of the culture, replace 4 ml/well of the medium 2 to 3 times a week for 2 to 4 months (depending on the experimental design) with B27 base medium supplemented with fresh 20 ng/ml BDNF, 10 ng/ml GDNF, 200 µM ascorbic acid, 500 µM cAMP, and 1 µM DAPT. Depending on the experimental design, the organoids can now be analyzed at different time points with the technique of choice. To perform IHF/IHC, proceed to Basic Protocol 3[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-prot-0003].\nBe aware that the morphology and size of the brain organoids will change over time, reflecting different stages of VM differentiation.\nRT-qPCR is one technique that is routinely used to determine progenitor cell identity during VM organoid differentiation. Specifically, for gene expression studies, 1 µg of extracted RNA and random primers were used here for cDNA synthesis (RNeasy Micro kit, Qiagen, cat. no. 74004; Maxima First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit, Thermo Fisher, cat.

    "During the differentiation of human VM organoids, cells in 3D space start exhibiting distinct molecular and architectural features. The presence of characteristic cell structures with apical-basal polarity and the formation of distinct cell layers is commonly analyzed by immunofluorescence staining using specific antibodies for marker proteins. The expression of immature and post-mitotic DA neuronal markers, including FOXA2, LMX1A, OTX2, and TH, detected by immunohistochemistry, is also specifically used to analyze VM differentiation efficiency. Specifically, maturation to A9-like DA neurons, which consist of pigmented neurons located in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in primate VM (Bjorklund & Dunnett, 2007[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-bib-0003]), can be detected using Fontana-Masson staining in combination with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry, which reveals the presence of dark neuromelanin granules (Figs. 3E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-fig-0003] and 4B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-fig-0004]).\nHere, we describe how to molecularly characterize VM organoids generated from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-prot-0002] at the protein level. We report a step-by-step protocol for embedding and sectioning VM organoids to guarantee an efficient immunohistochemical analysis, including detection of neuromelanin pigmented DA neurons after long-term culture. This protocol is based on Fiorenzano et al.

Transfer 3 to 6 VM organoids at the desired time point (from Basic Protocol 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-prot-0002]) to a single well of a 24-well plate, remove any residual medium, and fix them with 500 µl/well of 4% v/v paraformaldehyde for 5 hr at RT.\n2. Perform three 5-min washes with 1 ml/well of 1× PBS.\n3. Remove the PBS and add 2 ml of 30% w/v sucrose to each well and leave overnight at 4°C on a shaker.\n4. Replace sucrose solution with 2 ml of 1:1 (by volume) OCT:30% w/v sucrose mixture for 6 hr at 4°C on an orbital shaker.\n5. Use a 5-ml pipette to transfer VM organoids to a cryomold and fill with OCT.\n6. Immediately transfer the cryomold to dry ice and leave it to freeze for 5 min.\nFrozen cryomolds can be stored at −80°C until needed.",
    "7. Using a cryostat, section the organoids embedded in OCT at 20 μm and then transfer the sections onto glass slides with the help of a brush.\nSections can be stored at −20°C until needed. To perform immunofluorescence, continue to step 8. If neuromelanin detection is desired, please proceed to step 16.\n8. Wash the slides in 1× PBS three times for 5 min each.\n9. Fix the slides in 4% v/v paraformaldehyde for 10 min at RT and wash again three times with 1× PBS, as in step 8.\n10. Incubate each slide with 500 µl of 0.3% v/v Triton X-100 and 5% v/v donkey serum in 1× PBS for at least 1 hr at RT.\n11. Prepare primary antibodies solutions by diluting them in the same solution as step 10.\nCombinations of two or three antibodies, including DAPI, can be used on different VM organoids simultaneously. A list of primary antibodies and relative dilutions is reported in Table 2[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-tbl-0002].\n12. Incubate each slide with 300 µl of primary antibody solution overnight at 4°C.\nA humidified chamber is recommended, to avoid drying of the sections.\n13. The next day, wash the sections in 1× PBS three times, for 5 min each.\n14. After incubation with primary antibodies, incubate the sections for at least 1 hr with 300 µl/slide of the appropriate secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488, 594, and 647 used at 1:400 in the same solution as in step 10) and then mount with coverslip and 500 µl PVA-DABCO containing DAPI (1:1000).\n15. Analyze the immunocytochemically stained VM organoid sections using a fluorescence microscope or a confocal laser scanning microscope to estimate the expression pattern of early and late DA neuron markers. See Figure 3B[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-fig-0003]-E[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-fig-0003].\nImmunohistochemistry for neuromelanin detection",
    "The following protocol is based on the Fontana-Masson method to visualize melanin in cells, as well as argentaffin cell granules and lipofuscins, which takes advantage of a silver-reducing technique. All reagents are included in the Fontana-Masson staining kit listed in Materials. This protocol is also compatible with DAB pre-stained tissue. All steps are performed in staining jars; make sure that all sections are completely covered with solution.\n16. Prepare the ammoniacal silver solution by adding 33% ammonia solution drop by drop to 20 ml of 10% aqueous silver nitrate solution in a glass flask. Constantly agitate the flask to favor the dissolution of the formed precipitate. Stop adding the ammonia solution once a faint opalescence is obtained and the precipitate is dissolved.\n17. After titration, add 20 ml distilled water.\nThe solution can be stored at 4°C for up to a month. For optimal performance, store the bottle in the dark. Note that ammoniacal silver solutions are potentially explosive if stored incorrectly.\n18. Hydrate the sections by rinsing them in tap water.\n19. Wash the sections three times for 1 min each in distilled water.\n20. Transfer the slides to a clean jar filled with the ammoniacal silver solution from step 17, cover with aluminum foil, and incubate in an oven at 56°C for 30 to 40 min.\nAfter 30 min, check the slides on the microscope until optimal staining is observed. Do not over-incubate, to avoid the formation of deposits over the sections. Make sure that the staining jar is clean, as the ammoniacal silver solution will react with any contaminant that might be present in the jar.\n21. Gently wash the slides at least three times for 1 min each in distilled water.\n22. Immerse the slides in 5% aqueous sodium thiosulphate solution for 1 min.",
    "23. Wash well in running tap water for 3 min and rinse in distilled water.\n24. Counterstain with 0.1% neutral red solution for 1 min.\n25. Rinse in distilled water.\n26. Rapidly dehydrate the sections by rinsing them in absolute ethanol three times, for 1 min each.\nAlternatively, dehydration can be achieved through a series of alcohols of ascending concentrations.\n27. Clear the sections by immersion in fresh xylene three times, for 1 min each, and place under a coverslip with DPX mountant.\n28. Analyze the immunohistochemically stained VM organoid section using a bright-field microscope to quantify the number of neuromelanin+ organoids (Fig. 4[href=https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.555#cpz1555-fig-0004]).\nAt the end of the procedure, melanin granules should be visible as black, while nuclei will be red. Users should expect to see between 40% and 60% neuromelanin+ organoids at 5 months."
