  "procedures": [
    "Assembly of a custom-designed, two-port divided T-olfactometer previously described in Mann et al.10 is shown in Figure 1. The olfactometer consists of a 30 cm glass tube that is bifurcated into two separate ports with a Teflon strip forming a T-maze. Each half is analogous to an arm of a 2-choice style olfactometer enabling the test subject to choose between two potential odor fields.\n\t\nAssembly and subsequent assays should take place within a temperature-controlled room or environmental chamber.\nMount glass T-maze olfactometer vertically as shown in Figure 1 and position it under a fluorescent 900 lux light bulb.\nFor optimal light diffusion, the assembly should be mounted within a 1.0 x 0.6 x 0.6 m opaque container to maximize uniform light diffusion.\nConnect the olfactometer arms to odor sources that will be housed in solid-phase micro-extraction holding/odor source chamber (SPMEC) (ARS, Inc., Gainesville, FL) through Teflon;-glass tube connectors. Each SPMEC is comprised of a straight glass tube (17.5 cm long x 3.5 cm wide) supported with an inlet and outlet valve for incoming and outgoing air streams (Figure 1).\nConnect the air delivery system to an external source of humidified and carbon-purified air that is under constant pressure (the air delivery system has both an internal carbon filter for air purification and an air bubbler for humidification if external sources are unavailable).\nDissolve desired chemical samples within appropriate diluent (solvent) and pipette onto a slow release substrate such as a cotton wick (Petty John Packaging, Inc., Concord, NC). The control treatment should consist of a cotton wick impregnated with solvent only.",
    "To prevent significant contamination of the glassware, envelop the treated and control cotton wicks in laboratory tissue (Kimwipes, Kimberly-Clark, Roswell, GA) and place into the two SPMEC arms (ARS, Inc., Gainesville, FL). In the case of live plant samples, a guillotine volatile collection chamber can be attached to the olfactometer containing treatments in place of the SPMEC (Figure 1).\nDeliver purified and humidified air through the SPMEC (or guillotine volatile chamber) via two pumps connected to an air delivery system (Figure 1). Maintain airflow rate at 0.1 L/min through both arms of the olfactometer.\nEmploying olfactometer to test arthropod response to putative repellents. In the present description, a hemipteran insect, Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, was used as a test arthropod. Response was tested to citrus volatiles alone or in combination with a repellent (dimethyl disulfide) and clean air as odor sources.\n\t\nConduct all experiments at a standardized temperature and relative humidity.\nPrior to all tests, expose test subjects to clean air versus clean air or solvent versus clean air in the T-maze olfactometer to verify the absence of positional bias or an effect of solvent on behavior of the test subject.\nAssign an odor source randomly to one of the arms of the olfactometer at the beginning of each bioassay. Reverse this position after every 10 test subjects assayed, at minimum, to eliminate potential of positional bias.\nTest the response of a minimum of 30 (and up to 120) test subjects per treatment combination.\nAllow test subjects 100-300 sec to exhibit a behavioral response based on previously established response (latency) interval.\nRecord if subject enters the treatment arm, control arm or remains in the release port or below the T-maze division.",
    "Score a treatment or control arm choice when a test subject crosses the division in the T-maze and moves into either olfactometer arm.\nScore a release arm choice when a test subject remains in the release port or below the T-maze division.\nClean the olfactometer and connecting tubes thoroughly with 2% soap solution and bake the glass components at 200 °F between the use of different odor treatments.\nFor assays in which putative repellent treatments are presented in the T-maze olfactometer with or without a chemical treatment versus clean air, compare the number of test subjects remaining at the release point and not entering the olfactometer between treatments by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's HSD test (α < 0.05). In cases in which the test subjects leave the release arm, compare the number choosing the control arm versus the treatment arm with Chi square (χ2) analysis at α < 0.05."
