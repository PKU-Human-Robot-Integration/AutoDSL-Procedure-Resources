  "procedures": [
    "All procedures involving animals described in this manuscript were conducted according the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee at the University of Nevada.\nNOTE: The model presented here consists of the removal of the detrusor muscle while the urothelium and SubU/LP remain intact (Figure 1B) to enable investigators direct access to SubU/LP in the course of bladder filling.\n1. Dissection of the Detrusor-free Bladder Preparation\nPlace the isolated bladder in a dissecting dish filled with cold (10 °C) and oxygenated with 5% CO2/95 % O2 Krebs bicarbonate solution (KBS) with the following composition (mM): 118.5 NaCl, 4.2 KCl, 1.2 MgCl2, 23.8 NaHCO3, 1.2 KH2PO4, 11.0 dextrose, 1.8 CaCl2 (pH 7.4)13.\nPin a small portion of the dome of the isolated bladder to a Sylgard-covered dissecting dish filled with KBS. Make sure that the pin goes through a piece of the serosa or the outermost edge of the detrusor muscle far from the innermost edge of the muscle that faces the SubU/LP.\nUsing a microscope, identify the urethra and ureters and pin each of them to the bottom of the dissecting dish.\nRemove the excess adipose and connective tissues so that the entire main body of the bladder, the urethra and both ureters are displayed.\nTie the ureters with 6-0 nylon sutures. Then, pin the open ends of ureters towards the bottom of the dissecting dish to secure the preparation.\nUsing fine-tip forceps, gently pull a piece of the serosa at the corner between the ureter and the bladder body.\nAdjust the light of the microscope to increase transparency and distinguish the margin of the submucosa underneath the detrusor muscle.",
    "Start cutting (not peeling!) the bladder wall with fine-tip scissors along the inner surface of the detrusor muscle layer while gently pulling the cut segment away from the preparation. At all times, ensure that the lateral edge of mucosa can be seen and avoid touching it.\nRemove the detrusor muscle entirely by turning around the dissecting dish so that the position of the preparation is comfortable to continue dissecting out the detrusor muscle.\nLeave a small piece of detrusor muscle on the top of the bladder dome to ensure ability to immobilize the preparation during the remaining steps of the protocol.\nMake a double loop of 6-0 nylon thread, place it around the neck of the bladder preparation, and leave the loop loose.\nAdd a second double loop of 6-0 silk thread, place it around the neck of the bladder preparation, and leave the loop lose. Having two sutures prevents leaks around the sutures.\nCut about 2 cm of 20 PE tubing (catheter), flare up the tip by moving slowly the tip close to a flame.\nFill the catheter with warm (37 °C) oxygenated KBS.\nInsert the catheter in the orifice of the bladder urethra and gently push the catheter until the catheter tip reaches approximately the middle of the bladder.\nTie the suture around the catheter and the surrounding tissue of the bladder neck.\nSlowly fill the bladder with about 50-100 μL of warm (37 °C) oxygenated KBS, lift it briefly (<10 s) above the surface of KBS, and monitor for leaks at the sutures and bladder body.\nIf no leak is observed, the preparation is ready for the experiment. If a leak around the suture is observed, remove the suture and replace it. If a leak from a hole in the bladder body is noticed, discard the preparation.",
    "2. Filling of the Denuded Bladder Preparation\nPerfuse KBS (37 °C) into a 3 mL chamber of a water (37 °C) jacketed organ dish with a Sylgard bottom.\nAdjust the oxygen and suction lines.\nPlace the denuded bladder preparation in the chamber.\nSecure the catheter to the side of the chamber so that the preparation does not float above the surface of the perfusion solution.\nConnect the bladder catheter to a longer PE20 tubing (infusion line) connected to the three way stopcock using same size fitting.\nMake sure that the lines between the infusion pump, the pressure transducer and the bladder are open.\nFill the infusion syringe with fresh, warm (37 °C) and oxygenated KBS.\nAdjust the pump parameters: type/volume of syringe (i.e., 1 mL), operation (i.e. Infuse), flow (i.e., constant), and flow rate (i.e., 15 μL/min).\nPress the Start button on the syringe pump to fill the bladder.\nMonitor filling volume and intravesical pressure during bladder filling.\n3. Detection of Mediators in the SubU/LP Aspect of the Denuded Bladder Preparation\nCollect aliquots of the bath solution into ice-cold microcentrifuge tubes or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) inserts.\nPrepare and process the samples according to the appropriate detection application. In the case of detecting purine availability, process the samples by HPLC with fluorescence detection13,18.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
