    "The protocol was performed in accordance with the guidelines approved by the Institutional Review Board at the University of Maryland, College Park.\n1. Experimental Set-up\nSet up a motion capture system as shown in Figure 1a. Place eight cameras in a circle with a radius of 4 m.\n\tNOTE: The number and positions of cameras can be varied, provided all cameras are appropriately positioned to obtain a clear vision of all reflective markers attached to a participant's body.\nSet up a stepping station in the center of the circle. Position a \"home position\" covered by dark blue felt mats in the center of the stepping station and place six stepping targets covered by light blue felt mats surrounding the home position as its front, back, and side (Figure 1b). Determine the distance between the targets and home position, according to an individual's stepping distance (see step 3 in the foot-stepping SRT task procedure).\nTo control the task pacing condition, place two electric rubber sensors, which generate analog signals when touched, under the home position to detect the time when the feet return.\nPosition a 23'' monitor 2 m in front of the home position. The six visual stimuli are spatially matched with those six stepping targets on the floor.\nControl the appearance order of the visual stimuli using a computer program installed in a laptop.\nSynchronize the laptop and the motion capture system using a data output and acquisition device.\nTurn on the motion capture cameras, and aim them so that each camera can view the volume surrounding the stepping station.",
    "Identify whether there are unwanted reflective objects from the capture volume (e.g., reflection from light, floor, or any reflective materials). Cover these identified reflective objects with fabric material, so that they are not mistakenly collected as data during experimental trials.\nUsing the instructions and equipment supplied with the motion capture system, calibrate the motion capture system to ensure accurate collection of 3-D data from reflective markers18.\nFor dynamic calibration, wave the calibration wand supplied with the motion capture system through the space where all reflective markers would move when participants perform the SRT task. Collect 2,000 frames of imaging data for dynamic calibration.\nFor static calibration, place the calibration wand on the floor with a position and orientation which can be used as the origin of the coordination system of the motion capture system. Run the motion capture system to set the origin.\nDesign a marker set depending on the purpose of study.\n\tNOTE: One example is shown in Figure 1b where a 38-marker set-up is used.\nFollow the vendor-supplied instructions to create a labeling skeleton template that can be used for reconstruction and auto-labelling in later data acquisition and processing18. Specifically, ask a participant to stand on the home position of the stepping station with all markers attached. Instruct the participant to stand as still as possible and make sure all markers are visible through the motion capture system. Capture a trial (lasting about 10 s). In the motion capture system, assign each marker a name and create segments by connecting markers together. Link all segments to finalize the skeleton template (shown in Figure 1c).\n2. Participant Preparation\nInform participants to wear appropriate attire (e.g., shorts and a t-shirt) before visiting the lab.\nUpon arrival, ask participants to carefully read and sign the consent form. Screen for study eligibility.",
    "NOTE: The screening questionnaires could be different based on the purpose of each individual study. These questionnaires may include, but are not limited to, the hand dominance questionnaire19, global physical activity level questionnaire20, neurological health questionnaire, and the Movement Assessment Battery for Children21.\nAsk participants to take off their shoes and socks, then attach 38 spherical reflective markers, each 50 mm in diameter, to the skin at pre-determined significant bony landmarks using double sided, hypo-allergenic adhesive tape and pre-wrapping tape. This marker set-up is the same as the customized skeleton template shown in Figure 1b.\nClear all unwanted reflections other than those 38 markers from the participant's body (see step 1.8).\nInstruct participants to stand quietly on the home position in a T-pose. Run the motion capture system to capture all markers for 10 s (i.e., the calibration trial).\n3. The Foot-stepping SRT Task Procedure\nBefore each participant starts the task, set up the parameters, including, but not limited to: participant ID, group ID, number of learning block, the time length of stimulus presentation, and the time interval between stimuli (ISI) or response-stimulus interval (RSI) that controls the time interval between the completion of movement and the onset of the next stimulus (in this case, electric rubber sensors are needed under the home position; see protocol section 1 for details).\n\tNOTE: The ISI could be varied (e.g., 1,300 ms or 1,000 ms) according to the purpose of the study.\nInstruct participants to stand on the home position and adjust the distance of the home position so that participants can comfortably step onto all six targets on the floor.\nInstruct participants to quickly step on each target several times, and mark the distance from the home position to each target at the most comfortable stepping length for each participant.",
    "Provide the task instructions to participants.\n\t\nInstruct participants that once a stimulus appears at one of six locations shown on the monitor, they need to step as quickly and accurately as possible to the corresponding target on the floor and then return to the home position.\nAsk participants to step with the right foot to the three targets located on the right side (i.e., targets 1, 2, and 6; Figure 1a), and the left foot to the other three targets (i.e., targets 3, 4, and 5; Figure 1a).\n\t\tNOTE: The numbers are invisible to participants during the entire task.\nInform participants that there is a 3 min break after each run (i.e., learning block) of the task. Modify the length of the break based on experimental needs. Set a time alarm to remind participants of the end of the break.\nInstruct participants to keep their elbows by their side and bent at a ninety-degree angle when they perform the task so that the cameras can see the markers placed on the hip.\nRun a practice block that consists of 36 steps (i.e., stimuli appear 36 times with a ISI of 1,300Â ms; see the foot-stepping SRT task procedure for details) so that participants are familiar with the task. Instruct participants that stimuli will continuously appear at one of six locations and they need to respond to stimuli as fast and accurately as they can. Stimuli in this block appear in a random order.\n\tNOTE: The ISI could be replaced by an RSI (see the foot-stepping SRT task procedure for details). If a very short ISI is used, participants may not be able to respond to some stimuli. These steps are considered errors.",
    "After the practice block, start the experimental blocks. In this protocol, there are six blocks and each experimental block is comprised of 100 steps/stimuli. Give participants a mandatory 3 min break after each block.\n\tNOTE: Under the 1,300 ms ISI condition, each block typically takes about 2.5 min. If a RSI is used, the length of each block may vary depending on how fast participants respond to stimuli.\n\t\nInstruct participants to complete six experimental blocks. Set the specific order of visual stimuli according to experimental purposes. Stimuli follow either a specified or random sequence. The presentation of stimulus order is unknown to participants.\n\t\tNOTE: The number of experimental blocks could vary. Here, a 6-block design is introduced where a specified sequence A is given in blocks 1 - 4 and 6 and a novel sequence B is presented in block 5. The specific and random sequence could also be varied. In this protocol, sequence A follows the order of 1423564215 (i.e., 1 - right side, 2 - right front, 3 - left front, 4 - left side, 5 - left back, and 6 - right back) and sequence B follows the order of 3615425214.\nBefore each learning block, instruct participants to response to stimuli as quickly and accurately as they can.\nUpon the completion of all learning blocks, ask participants to complete a posttest that consists of widely used recall and recognition tests described in the literature13,14,22.\n4. Data Processing and Statistical Analysis\nFor each participant, open collected data trials in the motion capture system software. Review each trial and fill in any gaps in the trial data according to the vendor-supplied instructions18.\nExport each data trial as an ASCII file that contains three coordinates for all 38 markers.",
    "Derive variables (i.e., reaction time (RT), movement time (MT), response time, and trajectory of the COM) from the ASCII files following steps below:\n\t\nInput the ASCII data files into data analysis software. Use an eighth-order Butterworth filter with a cutoff frequency of 10 Hz to filter the data3.\n\t\tNOTE: The way to derive the COM movement trajectory depends on the marker set-up. In the 38-marker set-up shown in Figure 1b, methods and anthropometric parameters described by De Leva23 may be employed. One can also track the movement of the approximate COM measured by a marker set at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra24.\nDerive response time, RT, and MT following the descriptions below:\n\t\t\nUse the markers attached on the heels, big toes, and the 5th metatarsals to characterize the trajectories of foot movements in data analysis software.\nPlot the trajectory of these three markers along the vertical direction (perpendicular to the floor). Plot the trajectory of the toe marker within the horizontal plane (parallel to the floor) to identify whether each step is correctly performed to the right target. Steps to a wrong target are excluded for later statistical analyses.\nMark the baseline of each marker's height before and after each step.\nIdentify the movement onset of each marker as the first sample when the marker reaches 10% of the maximum height.\nSince each subject may use different strategies to touch the target (using the toes or the 5th metatarsal), define the movement onset using the marker that reaches its peak the earliest.\nIdentifies the end-point of stepping as the time point when the used marker drops to the same height as the onset.\nContinuously run the data analysis program until 100 steps are processed.",
    "For all steps, calculate and output the response time as the temporal difference between the stimulus onset and the end of movement, RT as the temporal difference between the stimulus and movement onsets, and MT as the temporal difference between the movement onset and its end point. Save the output files in the .xls format.\nUsing these .xls files, calculate means of these variables for each block and across participants, data which will subsequently be used for statistical analyses.\nSince there is typically a within-subject factor (i.e., learning block) in the experimental design, use mixed-effect ANOVAs to analyze data (repeated measures ANOVA could be used with caution regarding the sphericity assumption). Determine the co-variance matrix used in the mixed-effect ANOVA by the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC). Decompose the significant results from the ANOVA using post hoc tests with specific multiple comparison correction procedures (depending on the experimental design). Set the statistical significance level at p = 0.05.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
