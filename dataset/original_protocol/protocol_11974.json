    "All human materials used in this protocol were used in accordance with European Union regulations. The human ES cell line used in this study was derived from a unique embryo. The couple who had donated the embryo was fully informed and gave their consent for an anonymous donation. A clinical-grade human ES cell line was derived from this embryo, banked, qualified, and properly documented by Roslin Cells (UK). hAMs were procured under sterile conditions during a cesarean section in mothers who signed an informed consent for placenta donation according to hospital guidelines (APHP, Hôpital Saint Louis).\n1. Preparation of Culture Media and Reagents\nPreparation of the RPE cell culture medium\nTo prepare the RPE cell culture medium, add 4% serum substitute (20 mL for a final volume of 500 mL), 1,000x diluted 2-mercaptoethanol (500 µL for a final volume of 500 mL), and 1% Eagle′s minimum essential medium (MEM) non-essential amino acids solution (5 mL for a final volume of 500 mL) to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) high glucose (475 mL for a final volume of 500 mL).\nPreparation of the transport/conservation medium\nTo prepare the transport/conservation medium, add 1% of penicillin-streptomycin (5 mL for a final volume of 500 mL) to CO2-independent medium (495 mL for a final volume of 500 mL) and keep it at 4 °C.\nResuspension of the thermolysin enzyme\nPreparation of a stock solution of thermolysin\n\t\t\nTo prepare a stock solution of thermolysin, thaw the thermolysin powder, which was stored at -20 °C, at room temperature.",
    "As the enzymatic activity may be variable from batch to batch, calculate this activity based on the certificate of analysis provided with the thermolysin powder of the batch to be used. Divide the \"Activity Neutral Protease calculated = ANPC\" (indicated in the Certificate of Analysis) by 181 (which is tyrosine's molecular weight). The result obtained corresponds to the total enzymatic activity of the supplied thermolysin powder (U/vial).\nPrepare a stock solution at 200 U/mL by adding the volume of water corresponding to the total enzymatic activity (U/vial) divided by 200 (U/mL).\nDissolve the enzyme by pipetting the water that was added up and down. Vortex the solution for 30 s and check whether the powder has completely been suspended. More pipetting may be required for a full dissolution.\nAliquot the stock solution and store it at -20 °C.\nPreparation of a working solution of thermolysin\n\t\tNOTE: The thermolysin solution must be prepared on the day of the hAM treatment.\n\t\t\nThaw the stock aliquots of thermolysin at 200 U/mL stored at -20 °C. Dilute the stock solution 200x in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) in order to obtain a final enzymatic activity of 1 U/mL. Prepare 40 mL to treat 1–4 hAM patches.\nFilter the thermolysin solution through a 0.2 µm filter prior to use.\nResuspension of gelatin\nPreparation of 20% gelatin solution and block\n\t\tNOTE: The 20% gelatin solution and block may be prepared up to 1 week before use.\n\t\t\nWarm the CO2-independent medium to 42 °C in a water bath for 30 min (up to 1 h). In a 50 mL tube, add 10 g of gelatin to 40 mL of warmed CO2-independent medium and vortex the solution.\nDissolve the gelatin for 30–60 min at 42 °C. Vortex each 10 min to homogenize the solution.",
    "Once the solution is homogeneous, add 4 mL of the 20% gelatin solution to four 6 cm culture dishes. Avoid bubbles. Add a plastic paraffin film to protect the dishes, and allow the solution to solidify at 4 °C.\nPreparation of 8% gelatin solution\n\t\tNOTE: The 8% gelatin solution may be prepared the day before use and stored at 4 °C.\n\t\t\nWarm the CO2-independent medium to 42 °C for 30 min (up to 1 h). In a 50 mL tube, add 4 g of gelatin to 46 mL of warmed CO2-independent medium and vortex the solution.\nDissolve the gelatin for 30–60 min at 42 °C. Add a plastic paraffin film to protect the tube and keep it in a water bath at 37 °C if it is to be used the same day, or store it at 4 °C if it is to be used later.\n2. Thermolysin Treatment of Human Amniotic Membranes\nHuman amniotic membrane wash\nHave hAMs supplied as small pieces (approximately 30 mm x 30 mm) fixed in a nylon scaffold, either already at 4 °C in PBS or frozen. If provided frozen, thaw the membranes at 37 °C in an incubator for 30 min.\nWash the membranes:\n\t\t\nPlace 1–4 membranes in a 250 mL bottle containing 80 mL of PBS. Use as many bottles as required.\nShake each bottle in a plate shaker at a high speed for 5 min, then discard the PBS. Add 80 mL of PBS and repeat.\nThermolysin treatment\nAdd 40 mL of the working solution of thermolysin (1 U/mL) per bottle containing the membranes (1–4 membranes per bottles; up to 3 bottles at a time).\nShake the bottles for 5 min at 450 rpm and then vortex them for 30 s. Repeat 1x.",
    "Discard the thermolysin solution and add 80 mL of PBS.\nShake the bottles for 5 min at 450 rpm. Discard the PBS and add 80 mL of PBS. Repeat 3x.\n3. Fixation of Human Amniotic Membranes on a Culture Insert\nUse long sterile forceps (that can reach the bottom of the bottle) to remove the hAMs one by one, and transfer each hAM to a 10 cm culture dish containing 10 mL of PBS.\nIn a new 10 cm culture dish containing 10 mL of PBS, place one of the membranes with the nylon facing down. Detach two of the four clips that are used to fix the membrane to nylon.\nInsert the smaller ring of the culture insert between the nylon and the membrane.\nMake sure that the membrane covers the smaller ring completely. Clip the second part of the culture insert on top of the membrane. The basement membrane of the hAM is facing up inside the culture insert. Detach the last two clips.\nCut, with sterile scissors, the excess of membrane outside the culture insert if necessary. Using forceps, transfer the membrane fixed in the culture insert to a 12-well plate, add PBS, and store the plate in an incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\nRepeat these operations (from step 3.2 to 3.5) with the other membranes.\n4. Thawing and Seeding of Retinal Pigment Epithelium Cells on Human Amniotic Membranes\nThawing of retinal pigment epithelium cells\nThe RPE cell bank is frozen at 1 million cells per cryogenic vial in liquid nitrogen. Thaw as many cryogenic vials as required (350,000 cells are seeded per membrane).",
    "Prepare a 15 mL tube containing 3 mL of RPE medium per cryogenic vial. Once the vial is thawed, transfer the cells to each tube. Repeat this operation for the other vials.\nHomogenize (pipette up and down a few times to resuspend the cells in the RPE medium) and take 10 µL of the cell solution and transfer it to a 1.5 mL tube. Add 10 µL of trypan blue. Place 15 µL of this solution in a counting chamber, then count the number of viable cells (not colored in blue) under a microscope with a 4X objective. Repeat this operation for the other vials.\nIn the meantime, centrifuge the 15 mL tubes at 110 x g for 5 min. Discard the supernatant and resuspend the cells at 700,000 cells/mL.\nSeeding of retinal pigment epithelium cells into human amniotic membranes\nRemove the 12-well plate containing the membranes from the incubator.\nAspirate the PBS. Add 500 µL of the cell suspension prepared in step 4.1.4 in the center of the culture insert. Add 1 mL of RPE medium outside the culture insert (inside the well). Repeat for the other membranes.\nPlace the 12-well plate containing the membranes in the incubator.\n5. Maintenance of Retinal Pigment Epithelium Cell Cultures on Human Amniotic Membranes\nRenew the medium 2x per week, usually on Monday and Friday, until at least day 30 of the culture.\nAspirate the medium inside and outside the culture insert for each well and renew it with fresh medium (1 mL outside the culture insert and 500 µL inside). Place the plate in the incubator at 37 °C and 5% CO2.\n6. Preparation of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium Patch for Transplantation\nNOTE: Starting at day 30 of the culture, the tissue is ready for transplantation.",
    "Warm the 8% gelatin solution in a water bath at 37 °C for 30 min. Fill the internal chamber of the vibratome with cold CO2-independent medium (at 4 °C).\nPlace the 20% gelatin block into the vibratome.\nTake the 6 cm culture dish containing the block of 20% gelatin from the fridge. Using a scalpel, cut out a 5 cm x 5 cm block. Paste the top side of the block to the support with cyanoacrylate glue or its equivalent.\nPlace a new blade in the vibratome.\nAdjust the level of the block until it is at the same level of the razor blade.\nFill the bath around the support with fresh CO2-independent medium at 4 °C. Cut the block with the vibratome using a medium velocity until the block is cut uniformly, leading to a smooth surface. Set the position 0.\nAspirate the medium around the block of gelatin until it is completely dry, and then take the 12-well culture plate containing the tissues from the incubator at 37 °C.\nUsing forceps, carefully open the culture insert on top of the gelatin block. Cut, with the scissors, all parts of the membranes that do not contain cells (outside the ring where cells were not cultured). Aspirate the entire residual medium.\nAdd 1 mL of the liquid 8% gelatin solution at 37 °C in order to cover the membranes. Carefully remove the excess. Wait 5–8 min to allow the gelatin to solidify.\nAdd fresh CO2-independent medium (at 4 °C) to the bath until the membrane is covered.\nCut, with the vibratome at a position of -100 µm, with a medium velocity, remaining aware of how the block behaves. At the end of the section, be careful to maintain the orientation of the tissue.",
    "With a scalpel, cut a corner to identify the orientation of the section.\nCollect the membrane embedded in gelatin with a spatula and place it in a 6-well plate filled with the conservation medium at 4 °C, until grafting it into the recipient eye.\nAt the time of the transplantation, adjust the size of the implant to the size of the recipient eye under a surgical microscope (1–3 for rats, 10–15 mm2 for non-human primates).\nSubscription Required.
