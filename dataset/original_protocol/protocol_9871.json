    "1. Build the electrical circuit\nNOTE: The protocol for building a single circuit for an available LED is described here. Instructions to expand this up to four LEDs are included in the supplementary info.\nTurn on the smoke absorber and the soldering iron. Add water to the wiping sponge, have the solder at hand.\n\tCAUTION: Make sure to take safety precautions to remove smoke and prevent burns.\nBegin soldering circuit components to the printed circuit board (PCB board) in the order shown in the supplementary panels.\n\tNOTE: Use a small amount of solder on the soldering iron tip to heat the metal of the component and the PCB board first and melt additional solder directly onto the components; flux can help a lot.\nSolder jumper wires and components (Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 3).\n\t\nFor the jumper wires (the insulated wiring that connects two points on the circuit board), use two pieces of orange [7.6 mm (0.3 inch)] and yellow [12 mm (0.4 inch)] wires from the jumper kit.\nClip the PCB board onto the “helping hands” and insert the jumper wires in the following pinholes, bend the terminals 45 degrees and add flux (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 3): a1 and a3 → ground (-) (orange), a7 → power supply (+) #7 (yellow), d2 → d6 (yellow).\nSolder and then trim the back of the wires.\nInsert LM317T voltage regulator in the following pinholes, bend the pins, and add flux (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 4): Adj → e5, Vout → e6, Vin → e7.\nSolder the left and right terminals first, trim them, then solder and trim the middle terminal.",
    "To set the low voltage range of the circuit, insert an 820 Ω resistor all the way down into pinholes, solder and trim c2 → c5 (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 5).\nTo enable LED control by the microcontroller, insert the transistor into b3–b5 (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure 6): Collector → b3, Base → b4, Emitter → b5.\n\t\tNOTE: Be aware of the orientation of the transistor to insert correctly; check the specs to find the Collector, Base, and Emitter designation.\nSolder the wire-to-wire connectors for the POT, LED, microcontroller, and power source.\n\tNOTE: Pay attention to the color of the wires of the wire-to-wire connectors and whether using a female or male wire-to-wire connector.\n\t\nDetermine whether a “low voltage” circuit or “high voltage” circuit is required for the desired LED (Figure 1C).\n\t\tNOTE: If the LED is on the “low voltage” list, a resistor in parallel with the POT is required.\nFor the “low voltage” or “high voltage” circuit, place the wire from a female wire-to-wire connector through hole a5 (Supplementary Figure 7). Do not solder into place yet if making the low voltage circuit.\n\t\tNOTE: Twist the bare wire ends so that the small wire hairs don’t flake out. If the wire seems too thick to push through the pinhole without fraying, cut 2–6 strands and then twist them back together (Supplementary Figure 7B–D).\nIf making the “high voltage” circuit, skip to step 1.4.5. If making the “low voltage” circuit, push a 560Ω resistor through the same hole (a5) and solder with the wire-to-wire connector lead.\nConnect the other end of the resistor to the ground (Supplementary Figure 7G).\nInsert the other end of the female wire-to-wire connector soldered into a5 hole connecting it to the ground and solder it (Supplementary Figure 8A,B).",
    "For the microcontroller connection, insert one end of a male wire-to-wire connector into hole a4 and the other into a hole connected to the ground (Supplementary Figure 9A–C).\nFor the LED connection, insert one end of a female wire-to-wire connector into hole a2 and the other end into a hole connected to the ground (Supplementary Figure 9D,E).\n2.

    "Connect the male wire-to-wire connector to the POT.\n\t\nLoop the wire-to-wire connector's black wire around the middle terminal of the POT (Supplementary Figure 15B).\nTwist the wire that is looped tightly around the terminal and solder it (Supplementary Figure 15C).\n\t\tNOTE: Small precision pliers can assist in making a tight twist.\nRepeat with the red wire connection to the terminal, as in Supplementary Figure 15D.\nUse pliers to break the metal tab near the red arrow (Supplementary Figure 15E,F).\nBuild the microcontroller connection (only necessary for computer-controlled LEDs).\n\t\nIf making a LED driver for more than one LED, cut off the black wires from all but one female wire-to-wire connector (Supplementary Figure 16A).\nCrimp the ends of the wire-to-wire connectors, as shown (Supplementary Figure 16B–D).\nPush the crimped ends through the rectangular connector (Supplementary Figure 16E).\n3. Build the LEDs\nStrip the wire ends (~5 mm) and apply flux using a flux pen as in Supplementary Figure 3G.\n\tNOTE: To efficiently solder the wires onto the LED base, flux must be added to the contacts on the LED base and the wires.\nTin the wire by heating the wire from below and adding solder from the top (Supplementary Figure 17B).\nUse the flux pen to place flux onto the surface contact of the LED base (Supplementary Figure 17C).\nPlace a generous amount of solder onto a large soldering tip (~4–5 mm) (Supplementary Figure 17D), use it to heat the LED base at the contact (Supplementary Figure 17E). After a few seconds, drag the solder across the contact (Supplementary Figure 17F). Repeat steps 3.3–3.4 on the other contact (Supplementary Figure 17G).\n\tCAUTION: The LED base can get very hot during soldering. Place the LED base on a surface that will not melt or burn.",

Hold down the wire (Supplementary Figure 18D) and remove the soldering iron while holding the wire in place (Supplementary Figure 18E).\nPlace a small amount of solder paste onto the pads for the LED connections (Supplementary Figure 19A,B) and place the LED over the pads using forceps (Supplementary Figure 19C).\n\tNOTE: If the placement is a little off, it is okay; it will go into place once the solder paste melts.\nHold the red wire on the “A+” (anode) and clip it with a hair clip (Supplementary Figure 20A–C).\nPlace a generous amount of solder onto the large soldering tip (Supplementary Figure 20D) and press it down onto the wire until the solder on the LED base and the solder paste under the LED melts (Supplementary Figure 20E).\n\tNOTE: After the solder paste melts, the color becomes silver (Supplementary Figure 20H,I).\nChoose the length of the wire needed for the desired set up. Strip the LED wires, and a male wire-to-wire connector (Supplementary Figure 21A) then add flux as in Supplementary Figure 3G.\nPlace the shrink tube over the wires. Use a 3.18 mm (1/8 inch) shrink tube over the wire-to-wire connectors and a 4.76 mm (3/16 inch) shrink tube over the wire (Supplementary Figure 21B).\nClip the wire-to-wire connector with a “helping hands” and twist the connector end with the wire (Supplementary Figure 21C) and solder them.

Accommodate a black box to fit the illumination system\nFor a four LED system, drill four 0.83 cm (21/64 inch) holes on the lid 3.81 cm (1.5 inch) apart where the potentiometers will be attached (Supplementary Figure 25).",
    "Using a high-speed rotary tool, cut a 1.19 cm x 1.90 cm (0.47 inch x 0.75 inch) rectangular hole in the top-left corner (Supplementary Figure 25).\nUsing the spade drill bit, drill a 1.75 cm (11/16 inch) hole on the black box (Supplementary Figure 26).\nFile the holes and insert the grommet into the hole drilled in (Supplementary Figure 26).\nFor the computer-controlled LEDs, sandpaper the area where the microcontroller will be glued in a black box, as well as the bottom side of the microcontroller holder.\nSnap the microcontroller onto the holder before securing the holder in the black box and then epoxy them in place (Supplementary Figure 27A).\nUse sandpaper to sand the bottom of two clips and the area in a black box where the circuit will be placed and secure the clips inside the black box with the epoxy (Supplementary Figure 27A).\nSecure the PCB board into clips (Supplementary Figure 27B).\nPush the power switch through the square hole in the lid made in Supplementary Figure 25 and snap it into place (Supplementary Figure 28A).\nPush the POTs through the holes on the lid, screw into place (Supplementary Figure 28A), and put the knob onto the POT (Supplementary Figure 28B).\n5.
