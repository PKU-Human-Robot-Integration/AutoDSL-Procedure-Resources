    "All human computed tomography data sets were anonymized according to approved SJRMC protocol.\n1. CT Data Acquisition of Pre-clinical and Clinical Samples\nConduct micro X-ray computed tomography to generate a pre-clinical data set. In the present case, use a microCT to image a bone core specimen with the following settings: 45 kV, 0.4 mA, and 1,000 projections.5\nReconstruct raw data at high resolution (125 µm isotropic voxel). To further increase resolution, identify and reconstruct a 1 cm cube with a center at the volume's origin (10 µm isotropic voxel).\nExport the reconstructed data set in DICOM format for additional processing.\nAlternatively, acquire reconstructed CT data sets, such as those of the broken wrist and foot used in this study, from clinical collaborators (data shown here acquired from Saint Joseph Regional Medical Center) or open-source DICOM archives (http://www.osirix-viewer.com/datasets/).\nImport files into the DICOM imaging software and export as decompressed DICOM files if necessary.\n2. Data Processing\nOpen each DICOM data set (comprised of all image slices) using the 'Load DICOM' in the 'View' setting of the image processing software.\nSave each data set as a NIfTI analyze, an established imaging format for scientific analysis. Import the NIfTI files into a program with established use in medical imaging computed and automated segmentation for the generation of surface maps (e.g., 3DSlicer).\nUpload a given NIfTI file into the surface map generator program with the 'Add Data' tool.\nSelect the 'Grayscale Model Maker' tool with the specification \"Create and Rename new model\". Set lower threshold values to approximately 300 HU for the segmentation of bone.\nSave grayscale models as STL files for further data processing.\nImport each surface map into the 3D data preparation software (e.g., Netfabb Studio Basic) and select 'Repair' mode.",
    "Use the 'Select Part' and 'Delete' tools to delete all surfaces that do not represent the structure of interest.\nUse the 'Add Triangle' tool to partially cover the holes in surfaces and the 'Automatic Repair' script to completely close remaining gaps.\nSelect the 'Repair Degenerate Faces' script in the action menu to resolve edges without surface area and the 'Apply Repair' script to exit 'Repair' mode with the modified part.\nUse the 'Cut' tool to remove unwanted features or reduce the size of the model. Designate the location of each cut within the 'X', 'Y', or 'Z' plane in the 'Cut' menu of the context area.\nUse the 'Execute Cut' tool and choose 'Triangulate Cut' in the settings to automatically close all resulting holes.\nUse the 'Select Part' and 'Delete' tools simultaneously to delete all surfaces resulting from the cut that do not represent the structure of interest.\n\tNOTE: If the surface map is going to be adjoined with a scale bar, skip the following step. The anatomical feature and scale bar will be scaled simultaneously after they are united in a single STL.\nSelect the 'Scale' option to modify the dimensions of each surface map. Models may be dilated (bone core) or reduced in dimension (foot), or maintained at original size (wrist) to fit within an 8 cm cube or 5 cm x 5 cm x 8 cm rectangular prism. Note that files at this stage may be sent for SSLE if no labels or scale bars are desired.\n3. Anatomical Labeling\nSelect the 'New' option in the menu of the CAD program (e.g., Autodesk Inventor Professional) to create a new workbook using the metric template for a 'Standard (mm).ipt' part.",
    "Select the 'Create 2D Sketch' option and choose any plane. Use the 'Text' tool in the 'Draw' menu of the toolbar to produce typed anatomical labels with the desired font and size (Times New Roman and 2.0 mm).\nWhen finished, select the 'Finish Sketch' option in the 'Exit' menu of the toolbar.\nSelect the 'Extrude' tool from the 'Create' menu of the toolbar with the option '2D Text'. Designate an extrusion depth (2.0 mm) with the symmetric setting.\nExport text labels in CAD format with the 'Save As Type' STL setting.\nOpen a new workbook for the production of a cylindrical label line. Select the 'File' option to create a new metric template with a 'Standard (mm).ipt' part.\nSelect the 'Create 2D Sketch' tool and choose any plane. Use the 'Center Point Circle' tool in the 'Draw' menu of the toolbar to produce a circle with a center at the origin.\nUse the 'Dimension' tool in the 'Constraint' menu to set the diameter of the circle (1.0 mm).\nWhen finished, select the 'Finish Sketch' option in the 'Exit' menu of the toolbar.\nSelect the 'Extrude' tool chosen from the 'Create' menu of the toolbar with the option '2D text'. Select an extrusion depth (10.00 mm) with the symmetric setting.\nExport text labels and cylinders in CAD format with the 'Save as Type' .stl setting.\n4. Attachment of Labels\nImport models, text labels, and cylindrical label lines into the 3D data preparation software.\nTranslate text labels to the left or right of the associated anatomy using the 'Move Part' tool. Use the 'Rotate Part' tool to orient labels such that they face the same direction.\nTranslate and rotate cylindrical label lines using the 'Move Part' and 'Rotate Part' tools to connect labels to associated structures within the model.",
    "If necessary, enter 'Repair' mode and use the 'Select Triangles' and 'Remove Selected Triangles' to reduce the size of cylinders to the appropriate length.\nIf using the basic version, select all parts and save as a project. Then reopen this project in the professional version.\nIn the professional version, select all parts and export as a single STL.\n5. Scale Bar Design\nNOTE: Two types of scale bars are designed in the CAD program. The first is present in Figure 1 and involves three separate scale bars, with tick marks at distinct measurements, lying on each plane. The second, included in Figure 2, Figure 3, & Figure 4, is composed of perpendicular lines lying on the three axes and converging at a corner. Follow steps 5.1-5.2 to begin designing each scale bar.\nCreate a new workbook in the CAD program by selecting 'New' and 'Standard (mm).ipt' part.\nSelect 'Create 2D Sketch' and choose any of the three planes to begin working on.\n\tNOTE: Continue with steps 5.3-5.16 to produce the first type of scale bar. The dimensions provided were implemented for the creation of a 1 cm scale bar with tick marks at 25 mm increments.\nUse the 'Rectangle' and 'Dimension' tools to draw a rectangle (10 mm x 0.25 mm) with a width that corresponds to the desired length of the scale bar (10 mm) and a length of any reasonable value (0.25 mm). Place the lower left vertex on the origin so x-coordinates can be used for the spacing of tick marks.\nTo create the tick marks, utilize the 'Rectangle' tool to draw a rectangle directly above the scale bar. Constrain the size (0.025 mm x 0.432 mm) with the 'Dimension' tool.",
    "Using the x-coordinates, translate the newly formed rectangle so it lies at the desired distance from the edge. This is the top of the tick mark.\nTo create the bottom of the tick mark, draw another rectangle, with the same dimensions as the top half, directly below the scale bar. Use the 'Align' tool to align the two halves of the tick mark.\nChoose the 'Trim' tool in the 'Modify' menu and select the area where the scale bar and tick marks overlap. This will remove excess lines and allow the part to be interpreted as a single feature when extruded.\nRepeat steps 5.4-5.7 for the rest of the tick marks.\nWhen finished, select the 'Finish Sketch' option in the 'Exit' menu of the toolbar.\nChoose 'Extrude' under the 'Create' menu and select the scale bar. Determine an extrusion distance and direction (0.25 mm and into the screen).\nTo design labels for the tick marks, choose 'Create 2D Sketch' and select the scale bar as the working plane.\nUnder the 'Draw' menu, select the 'Text' tool to create text with a certain font and size (Times New Roman and 0.25 mm). Translate the text to its desired position next to the scale bar.\nWhen finished, select the 'Finish Sketch' option in the 'Exit' menu of the toolbar.\nSelect the 'Extrude' tool from the 'Create' menu of the toolbar with the option '2D Text'. Designate an extrusion depth (0.25 mm) and direction (into the screen).\nRepeat steps 5.12-5.14 to create the other labels.\nExport the completed scale bar in CAD format with the 'Save As Type' .stl setting.",
    "NOTE: After finishing steps 5.1-5.16, continue with steps 5.17-5.31 to create the second type of scale bar. The measurements provided were utilized to create a scale bar that was 2 cm on each axis and 2 mm thick.\nSelect the 'Rectangle' tool to create a square and constrain the length and width (2 mm x 2 mm) with the 'Dimension' tool. The dimensions selected in this step will determine the thickness of the part.\nSelect 'Finish Sketch' to return to the 3D Model setting.\nUnder 'Create', choose 'Extrude' and select the square drawn in 2D Sketch mode. Choose the desired extrusion depth and direction (20 mm and into the screen).\nSelect 'Create 2D Sketch' and continue working on the same plane as the previous sketch.\nUse the 'Rectangle' and 'Dimension' tools to draw a rectangle (2 mm x 18 mm) directly above the square. Match the length of the rectangle to the length of the square (2 mm) and the width should be the desired size of the scale bar minus the width of the square (20 mm - 2 mm = 18 mm). Press 'Finish Sketch' when completed.\nUnder 'Create', choose 'Extrude' and select the rectangle. Enter an extrusion depth, which should be the length of the square (2 mm), and select a direction (into the screen).\nRotate the part so that it looks like the letter 'L'. Create a new 2D sketch and select the front of the 'L' as the working plane.\nDraw a square at the corner of the two rectangles using the 'Rectangle' tool. Constrain the dimensions (2 mm x 2 mm) so that it fits exactly in the corner. Exit the sketch with the 'Finish Sketch' tool.",
    "Under 'Create,', choose 'Extrude' and select the newly created square. Enter an extrusion distance, which should be the desired size of the scale bar minus the width of the square (20 mm - 2 mm = 18 mm). Choose a direction (out of the screen) and apply the extrusion.\nTo add text indicating the dimensions of the scale bar, create a new 2D sketch off of any plane.\nUse the 'Text' tool in the 'Draw' menu of the toolbar to produce a label with the desired font and size (Times New Roman and 2.5 mm).\nTranslate the text to its desired position next to the scale bar. Exit sketch mode by selecting 'Finish Sketch'.\nUtilize the 'Extrude' tool and enter an extrusion distance that matches the thickness of the scale bar (2 mm) and direction that aligns the label with the scale bar (into the screen).\nRepeat steps 5.26-5.30 using the other planes to create labels for all three axes.\nWhen finished, export the scale bar and its accompanying labels in CAD format with the 'Save as Type' .stl setting.\n6. Addition of Scale Bars to Anatomical Models\nOpen the anatomical model in the 3D data preparation software and import the scale bar.\nUse the 'Move Part' and 'Rotate Part' tools to orient the scale bar next to the anatomical model.\nIf the first type of scale bar was created, import the part two more times. Translate and rotate the individual scale bars so one lies on each axis.\nIf using the basic version, select all parts and save as a project.\nOpen the file in the professional version. Select all parts and export as a single STL.",
    "NOTE: Dimensions are retained when surface maps and scale bars are imported into the basic or professional version. Prior to engraving, surface maps, along with associated labels and scale bars, are scaled to fit inside the crystals. Since scale bars are scaled at the same rate as models, alterations in the sizes of scale bars are representative of dimension changes in the anatomical structures.\n7. Reduction of Faces\nUtilize the 'Import Mesh' tool to add an .STL file in the 3D mesh-processing program. Adjustments will be applied to the surface model and all components, including text and scale bars, since the software interprets the mesh as one part.\nUnder 'Filters' and 'Remeshing, Simplification and Reconstruction,' select the 'Quadratic Edge Collapse Decimation' tool to reduce the number of faces present within the mesh.\nEnter the desired number of faces (100,000) under the 'Target number of faces' and select 'Apply.' This operation is done to create a manageable file size for the SSLE software, and prevent excess engraving times.\nExport the finished product as an STL using the 'Export Mesh As…' setting.\n8. Model Engraving in Crystal\nNOTE: Completed STL files are forwarded to an industrial collaborator, where glass crystals are laser engraved to produce physical models of the anatomical data. For inquiries and further assistance, please contact the industry authors of this manuscript.\nOpen the STL file into a laser engraving software program and convert to a SCAX file.\nImport the SCAX file in a software package connected to the 3D laser engraving machine.\nDefine a crystal size appropriate for interfacing with the SCAX file.",
    "Set the power of the laser and enter a voltage and density. While 8.5 V and 0.2 are typically selected for voltage and density, other measurements can be determined by reducing the voltage and increasing the density, making sure that the crystal does not crack or break.\nSend the file to a 3D laser engraver for crystal production."
