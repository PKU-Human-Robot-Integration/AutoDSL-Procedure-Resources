    "NOTE: The experiments comply with the Laws of Animal Protection of Mexico.\n1. Experimental Setup\nGeneral connections\n\t\nConnect the amplifier to a suitable computer through an analog-to-digital converter and use an oscilloscope to monitor the experiment (Figure 1).\nConnect the photostimulator to the A/D converted.\nRecording chamber\n\t\nPlace the recording chamber on top of an anti-vibration table and locate it inside a Faraday cage.\n\t\tNOTE: This prevents mechanical vibration and electrical noise that may affect the recording. Our Faraday cage was made of darkened wire mesh. A homemade, 2 mL, acrylic recording chamber is used (Figure 2).\nPrepare the bath solution to keep the preparation alive13: 205 mM NaCl; 5 mM KCl; 2 mM MgSO4; 13 mM CaCl2; 5 mM Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.3.\n\t\t​NOTE: Solution does not include dextrose or any bubbling by 95% O2, 5% CO2 mixture because the experimental procedure is short enough to detect damage by the electrical recording (see step 4.2.3 for completeness).\nElectrodes\n\t\nUse a chloride-coated silver-wire electrode as the reference electrode\n\t\tNOTE: Silver chloride coating is necessary to allow the electrode reaction: AgCl(s) + e−↔ Ag(s) + Cl-.\nSand a silver wire (thickness ~ 1 mm, length ~ 10 cm) with a fine grade emery paper in order to clean its surface.\nRinse the silver wire with distilled water.\nImmerse the clean silver-wire in a 4-6% sodium hypochlorite solution (NaClO) until it appears dark (approximately 20 min).\nUse thin glass pipettes filled with an electrolyte solution (2.7 M KCl) as the intracellular electrode.\nPull a glass capillary tube (internal diameter ≈ 1 mm) with a micro-pipette puller to obtain a thin tip with a small opening (0.01-0.1 µm)14.",
    "Fill the pulled capillary glass with a 2.7 M KCl solution. First fill it by capillarity (immerse the pipette tip into the 2.7 M KCl solution) and then fill the half of the pipette with a fine injection needle. If necessary, tap the electrode pipette to eliminate air bubbles.\nConnect the electrode to its holder. Connect the holder to the amplifier headstage with the amplifier. Position the electrode-holder-headstage with a stable 3-D micromanipulator. Lower the electrode until bath solution covers its tip.\n\t\tNOTE: The electrode must have a vertical orientation\nSelect the Bridge Mode of the amplifier (in the Mode section of the amplifier, press the Bridge button) and measure the electrode resistance. Make sure that the resistance is about 50 MΩ11.\n\t​NOTE: This electrode size allows a good-quality electrical recording with limited damage to the cell.\nNull the offset current and compensate capacitive transients using the Holding Position button in the section Voltage Clamp of the amplifier, and the Capacitance Neutralization button in Microelectrode 1 section of the amplifier.\nSuperfusion system\n\t\nPour the bath solution (step 1.2.2) into a suitable receptacle (a 250 mL serum bottle) and connect it to an irrigation tubing set (3.2 mm of internal diameter), thus connecting the recording chamber. Use a gravity driven superfusion system. Regulate the flow rate to ~ 0.5 mL/s.\nConnect the chamber to a suction device. Regulate the solution suction system in such a way that the total volume of the recording chamber does not vary. Use a vacuum pump for suction.\n\t\tNOTE: A constant volume in the recording chamber is important to keep stray capacitances constant throughout the experiment.\n2. Biological Material\nNote: Use adult crayfishes P. clarkii (7-10 cm long) in the intermolt stage of indistinct sex.\nCircadian time",
    "One month prior to the experiments, maintain 100 crayfishes under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle15 (white light, 2.4 kW/m2).\n\t\tNOTE: One month is sufficient time to synchronize the crayfish population.\nDetermine the circadian time of the crayfish population by assessing the amplitude of electroretinograms of five randomly chosen animals15.\n\t\tNOTE: 0 h circadian time (CT 0) indicates the beginning of a subjective day, i.e., time during which an organism is normally active16,17,18,19 (Figure 3). The crayfish is a nocturnal animal, so under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle, it is active during the dark phase.\nEyestalk isolation procedure\n\t\nAt the desired circadian time, anesthetize a selected crayfish by immersion in tap water at 0-4 °C, for 15 min.\nBy means of a fine scissor, detach the eyestalk from the base.\nAccess the retina using a razor blade to make an opening (~ 1-mm2) in the dorsal cornea.\nPlace the eyestalk in the center of the recording chamber (the hole covered with silicone) with the access opening to the retina on the top of the chamber.\nKeep the eyestalk under constant darkness for 20 min.\n\tNOTE: 20 min is sufficient time for the photoreceptor cell to be fully dark adapted.\n3. Photoreceptor Impaling\nPut the microelectrode and the eyestalk's longitudinal axis parallel in such a way that the microelectrode is centered for access to the retina. Use a stereoscopic microscope (10X) to place the devices in the correct configuration.\nMonitor the voltage difference between the reference and recording electrodes by selecting the Bridge Mode11 of the amplifier.\nLower the electrode into the bath and thereafter place it right over the retina.\nMove away the microscope and position the photostimulator lamp parallel to the eyestalk's longitudinal axis.\n\tNOTE: Distance between lamp and superfusion chamber is approximately 15 cm.",
    "Slowly lower the microelectrode until a sudden voltage drop is detected.\n\tNOTE: A voltage drop of around −50 mV indicates the impalement of a healthy photoreceptor cell.\nDeliver a test light-flash (white light, 7.2 kW/m2, 10 µs duration) to record the photoreceptor's receptor potential.\n\tNOTE: The photoreceptor's receptor potential is a depolarizing potential of 10-15 mV amplitude and 300 ms duration (Figure 4).\n4. Electrical Recording\nEnsure that the photoreceptor cells are totally adapted to dark conditions (see step 2.3).\n\t\nDeliver a test-light flash every 2 min. Automate the time between flashes by choosing an adequate value (120 s) of \"time between episodes\" in the data acquisition software.\n\t\t​NOTE: 2 min is the necessary time to allow the total recovery of the currents underlying the photoreceptor's electrical response.\nMonitor the resting membrane potential, as well as the amplitude and duration of the receptor potential. Assume that the photoreceptor is completely adapted once the membrane potential, amplitude, and duration of the receptor potential remain unchanged. Eyestalks previously kept under constant darkness for 20 min (step 2.3) complete their adaptation in approximately 5 min.\nStop stimulating the cell 2 min before recording the light-elicited current.\nCurrent recording\n\t\nClamp the voltage at the measured resting membrane potential value of the cell by selecting \"Holding amplitude\" in the data acquisition software (in Waveform on the Analog Output Channel section).\nSelect the dSEVC mode of the amplifier. In the Mode section of the amplifier, select the SEVC button and switch the lever to the Discont SEVC position.\nSet the switching rate to 500-1,000 Hz (by using the Rate Adjust button of the amplifier), as determined by the speed of the electrode11.\nDeliver a light-flash, and observe the evoked ion influx.\n\t\tNOTE: This is the light-elicited or transduction current (Figure 5).",
    "Return to the Bridge mode on the amplifier and record a receptor potential by sending a light flash (see section 3). Make sure that the photoreceptor cell is totally adapted to dark conditions. Measure the receptor potential characteristics (amplitude and duration) and compare with the first measurements. Assume that the impaled photoreceptor cell is a healthy cell if they have the same characteristics.\n\t\tNOTE: After eyestalk ablation, biological preparation is viable during the following 2 h.\nTwo pulse protocol: Measure the recovery from desensitization with a two light-flash protocol.\n\t​NOTE: The two light-flash protocol is similar to the standard two-pulse voltage protocol used to measure recovery from inactivation of voltage-gated channels20. The first light-flash causes a temporary change in the sensitivity of the photoreceptor cell and the second flash evaluates the state of the light-activated conductance.\n\t\nDeliver a pair of light pulses. Apply the second flash after a desired time interval (from 300 ms to 2 min).\nDigitize the currents at 10 KHz sampling with the data acquisition software and save the data for off-line analysis11.\n\t\tNOTE: A table with the configuration values of the software is included as supplementary material.\n5. Data Analysis\nKinetics of the light-elicited current\n\t\nMeasure three current parameters: activation latency L, the time elapsed from the light-flash delivery until the current attains 10% of its maximal amplitude (Figure 5); peak or maximal current amplitude Ip; and desensitization time constant T. Measure the desensitization time constant (Τ) by fitting the current decay phase to:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56258/56258eq1.jpg\n\t\twhere, A = -I(t=0) is a positive constant (Figure 5).\nDesensitization and recovery\n\t​Note: Recovery from desensitization was assessed as the ratio p2/p1, where p1 is the relevant parameter (either L, Ip, or T) of the control current, and p2 is the corresponding parameter of the second test-current.",
    "Plot p2/p1 (either L, Ip, or T) as a function of time between pulses.\nDepending on the parameter, fit the points of each plot to:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56258/56258eq2.jpg\n\t\tor to:\nimgsrc://cloudfront.jove.com/files/ftp_upload/56258/56258eq3.jpg\nUse an appropriate statistical test to determine the number of exponential terms required to fit the experimental data.\nSubscription Required.
