    "Patient samples were collected following approval from the Ethics Review Board of the University Hospitals of Basel and Tuebingen.\n1. Biotinylation of the NKG2D fusion protein\nNOTE: This step is performed with a biotinylation kit (see Table of Materials) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. This step of the protocol must be performed at least 24 h prior to the staining. The biotinylated NKG2D fusion protein should be stored at -20 °C.\nThaw both the biotin, as well as the NKG2D fusion protein tubes at room temperature (RT).\n\tNOTE: If the cells need to be sterile for further experimental use (injection in mice, colony forming unit assays, etc.), reconstitute the fusion protein under a laminar flow hood to avoid contamination. Otherwise, each step can be performed on a bench.\nQuickly spin down the 50µg of lyophilized NKG2D fusion protein. Add 500 µL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to reconstitute the powder and mix thoroughly using a P1000 micropipette.\nAdd 100 µL of the NKG2DL fusion protein to a biotin tube to obtain a final stock concentration of 100 µg/mL.\nMix the solution thoroughly by continuous resuspending with a P100 micropipette.\nIncubate the fusion protein/biotin solution at a controlled RT for 24 h. The fusion protein is now ready to use.\n2. Thawing of primary AML cells",
    "NOTE: Approximately 5,000,000 frozen leukemic cells per patient stored in liquid nitrogen were thawed and then used for the assays right away. Leukemic cells were obtained and frozen as previously described15. Briefly, peripheral blood samples collected from patients with AML and high blast cell percentages (>90% of blasts among mononuclear cells) were processed with a density gradient separation to obtain mononuclear cells and subsequently frozen in fetal calf serum (FCS) containing 10% dimethyl sulfoxide solution (DMSO). Cell numbers highly varied between patients in dependence on the leukocyte concentration in the patient (range: 1,000,000 to 30,000,000 leukemic cells per mL blood).\nPre-warm RPMI medium containing 10% of FCS at 37 °C using a water bath. For each vial of AML cells (up to 30,000,000 cells in 1 mL FCS + 10% DMSO), add 10 mL of pre-warmed medium to a 15 mL reaction tube.\nRemove the cryovial containing primary AML from the liquid nitrogen storage and immediately thaw the cells using a 37 °C water bath. Gently move the tube back and forth in the water, allowing the contents of the vial to thaw until there is only a small ice crystal left.\nImmediately transfer the thawed cells into the medium-containing tube and rinse the vial using 1 mL of medium.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nWash the cells with 5 mL of RPMI medium containing 10% of FCS and centrifuge at 300 x g for 10 min.\n3. Cell counting\nResuspend the cell pellet in a known volume of RPMI medium containing 10% of FCS.",
    "Transfer a small volume of the cell suspension to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube and dilute at a known ratio with trypan blue or any other alternative dye that allows live cell/dead cell discrimination.\nUse any device to count the cells.\nCentrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\n4. Staining of primary AML cells using the biotinylated NKG2D fusion protein\nPrepare the staining buffer by supplementing 500 mL PBS with bovine serum albumin (BSA) and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to a final concentration of 0.07 mM and 2 mM, respectively. Adjust the pH (7.2–7.4) if necessary.\nResuspend the cell pellet with staining buffer to a final concentration of 0.5 x 107 cells/mL.\n\tNOTE: Optionally, prior to staining, the cells can be incubated with a blocking agent (e.g. hIgG (1µg/ml) for 30 min at RT or FcR-blocking agent)..\nTransfer 100 µL of the cell suspension to a cell culture 96-well U-bottom plate and centrifuge the plate at 300 x g for 10 min. Discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nPrepare a master mix of biotinylated NKG2D fusion protein so that cells are resuspended in a final volume of 50 µL per well with a final concentration of 10 µg/mL per well.\nAdd the master mix prepared in step 4.4 using a 100 µL pipette and resuspend the cell pellets with a 300 µL multichannel pipette.\n\tNOTE: Scale down the final volume according to the number of cells to reduce the amount of fusion protein necessary for the staining.\nIncubate the cell suspension for 25 min at RT or 50 min at 4 °C.\nWash the cells by adding 200 µL of staining buffer per well with a 300 µL multichannel pipette.",
    "Centrifuge the plate at 300 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nRepeat steps 4.7 and 4.8.\n\tNOTE: The staining described here is performed in a cell culture 96-well U-bottom plate. Therefore, washing steps are performed twice because of the small volume capacity of such plates. The staining can also be performed in other tubes and washing steps might then be performed only once using a larger volume.\nPrepare a master mix using Streptavidin-PE (see Table 1 for dilutions) so that cells are resuspended in a final volume of 50 µL.\n\tNOTE: Add selection antibodies for your cell type of interest as e.g. CD33, CD34…. for AML.\nAdd the master mix prepared in step 4.10 using a 100 µL pipette and resuspend the cell pellets with a 300 µL multichannel pipette.\nIncubate the cell suspensions for 15 min at RT or 30 min at 4 °C in the dark.\nWash the cells by adding 200 µL of staining buffer per well with a 300 µL multichannel pipette.\nCentrifuge the plate at 300 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nRepeat steps 4.13 and 4.14.\nPrepare a solution of staining buffer including 7-AAD (7-Aminoactinomycin D, 1:1000) or any reagent to distinguish between live and dead cells.\nResuspend cell pellets in 200 µL staining buffer + 7-AAD prepared in step 4.16 in using a 300 µL multichannel micropipette.\nAnalyze the cells using a flow cytometry device.\n5. Staining of single or pooled single anti-NKG2DL antibodies\nUse the same cell suspension as in step 4.2.",
    "Transfer 100 µL of the cell suspension to a cell culture 96-well U-bottom plate using a 300 µL multichannel pipette and centrifuge the plate at 300 x g for 10 min. Discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nPrepare an antibody master mix for each primary antibody or pooled antibodies (see Table 2 for dilutions) so that the cells are resuspended in a final volume of 50 µL.\nAdd the master mix prepared in step 5.3 using a 100 µL pipette and resuspend the cell pellets with a 300 µL multichannel pipette.\nIncubate the cells for 25 min at RT.\nWash the cells by adding 200 µL of staining buffer per well using a 300 µL multichannel pipette.\nCentrifuge the cell culture 96-well U-bottom plate at 300 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nRepeat steps 5.6 and 5.7.\nPrepare an antibody master mix by adding the secondary antibody (see Table 2 for dilutions) so that the cells are resuspended in a final volume of 50 µL per well.\nAdd the master mix prepared in step 5.9 using a 100 µL pipette and resuspend the cell pellets with a 300 µL multichannel pipette.\nIncubate for 15 min at RT or 30 min at 4 °C in the dark.\nWash by adding 200 µL of staining buffer per well using a 300 µL multichannel pipette.\nCentrifuge the cell suspension at 300 x g for 10 min and discard the supernatant without disturbing the pellet.\nRepeat steps 5.12 and 5.13.\nResuspend cell pellets in 200 µL staining buffer containing 7-AAD prepared in step 4.16.\nAnalyze the cells using a flow cytometry device as described in step 6.\n6. Data acquisition",
    "NOTE: Make sure that weekly quality controls of the flow cytometer are performed to ensure that lasers are functioning properly. For the protocol presented here, a weekly Cytometer and Tracking (CTS) process is performed with relative beads to check laser performances on all channels. After the CTS, 10,000 events are recorded using the 8-peak beads as an internal control. All peaks should be in the same position inside their gates and well separated from each other.\nCreate the matrix compensation to subtract spectral overlap between detectors with beads or with cells16.\nRecord 10,000 events for the unstained cells and the single stained beads. For the fluorescence minus one (FMO) controls, record 50,000 events and for the full-stained samples record up to 100,000 events.\n\tNOTE: Alternatively, single stained samples can be performed on the cells. If so, make sure that the cells have a positive signal for the desired marker.\nAcquire a single stained cell or bead sample for each fluorophore used in the experiment to reveal the amount of spectral overlap. Use the compensation creator of the flow cytometry device to calculate spill-over values and apply the compensation matrix to all the measured samples.\n\tNOTE: Secondary antibodies cannot be used for compensation creation using beads if the compensation is calculated with beads. Depending on the type of compensation beads, secondary antibodies cannot be used for the compensation with beads.\nFor the FMO controls and the full stained samples with the fusion protein, firstly, select the cells based on their forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC). After the exclusion of doublets, gate the cells based on their negativity for 7-AAD (PercP-Cy5.5) signal to exclude the dead cells (see step 5.15). The final plot shows the expression of CD34 (Y-axis) and NKG2DL (X-axis) on living singlets.",
    "For the single anti-NKG2DL-antibodies, apply the same strategy to the samples but note that ligand positivity lies in Alexa Fluor 488 and not the PE channel.\nAdjust gates according to the FMO controls for gating strategy from step 6.4 and 6.5 (see Table 3) for appropriate FMO controls to perform for this experiment: In the analysis software, draw a gate on the negative fraction. While recording the full-stained sample, the cells above the previously created gate are positive for the analyzed marker.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
