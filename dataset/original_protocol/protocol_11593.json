    "The procedures presented below were approved by the Institutional Review Board of Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.\n1. Constructing Phantom Acupoints\nNote: The creation of a phantom acupoint with a similar torque amplitude as that of a human acupoint is important in applying this method because practicing acupuncture manipulation on a phantom acupoint must not feel different in quality from practicing on a human acupoint. Thus, a thorough development and validation process is required to qualify a phantom acupoint as a predefined human acupoint. A 5% agarose gel was shown to have a similar torque amplitude (59.2 ± 4.5 and 58.7 ± 4.6 µNm, respectively) to the LI4 acupoint, which is located between the thumb and index finger13.\nAdd 0.75 g agarose to 15 ml distilled water and dissolve the agarose gel; warm the solution in a microwave oven for 20 sec until the agarose becomes transparent. Use a concentration of 5% (0.75 g) to make phantom acupoints with torque amplitudes similar to those of human acupoints (e.g., the LI4 acupoint; Figure 1).\nDivide the agarose gel into 2 ml portions and seal them in five tubes. Make sure to wear gloves to avoid burns. Be careful to position the tubes perpendicularly at room temperature (25 °C) for 2 hr.\nEvaluate the degree of stimulation and biomechanical force of newly created phantom acupoints using an acupuncture needle and motion sensor specifically designed to measure acupuncture manipulation10. Position an acupuncture needle within a hole located at the center of the sensor before starting the evaluation. Evaluate the frequency using power in frequency domain calculated by Fourier transformation.",
    "Apply acupuncture to the phantom acupoint. When the needle is 15 mm deeper than the gel surface, rotate the needle for 15 sec while rotating one full circle clockwise and counter-clockwise in 1 sec (1 Hz). If possible, verify the velocity of rotation with a motion sensor real-time graph. Pull the needle from the gel after acupuncture manipulation.\n2. Implementation of the Acupuncture Manipulation Education System\nPrepare a 5% agarose gel phantom acupoint (process explained in step 1.1) that shows a torque amplitude similar to that of a real human arm, such as acupoint LI4, which is an acupoint located between the thumb and index finger.\nSanitize hands using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer before acupuncture manipulation to avoid possible wounds or infection while practicing acupuncture manipulation.\nPractice acupuncture using this program. Download this program from the website: http://cmslab.khu.ac.kr/downloads/ames and install the program. Start the program on the computer and prepare the motion sensor. Position an acupuncture needle through the hole located at the center of the sensor before starting the evaluation. Because the acupuncture needle is not attached to the sensor, be prepared to move the needle through the hole while the sensor measures the motion of the needle. Prepare the phantom acupoint to insert and manipulate the needle.\nChoose from various templates of acupuncture manipulation, including various frequencies and asymmetric movements. Before starting the manipulation, choose from lifting/thrusting or the rotating manipulation technique by pressing one of the two radio buttons displayed on the graphic user interface (GUI) software and decide whether the intended movement for practice follows the pattern of a 1:1 ratio, a 1:2 ratio, or a 2:1 ratio sine graph.",
    "Position the acupuncture needle (0.25 × 40 mm) in the motion sensor so that it is ready to be manipulated. Place the phantom acupoint under the needle and the sensor.\nCalibrate the motion sensor using a two-axis actuator. Position the acupuncture needle with the participant's finger and press Calibrate on the screen. Through the calibration, the two-axis actuator will recognize and adjust the current position as a zero value in depth.\nManipulate an acupuncture needle on the phantom acupoint for about 1 min while the actual movement of acupuncture manipulation is being measured. Have the participant look at the screen as they manipulate the needle to view the actual movement of his or her acupuncture manipulation concurrently, along with the intended movement. Transmitted actual movement is displayed as the green line, and the template of the intended motion is concurrently overlapped as the red line.\nAcquire real-time motion wave data (80.3 Hz sampling rate) of the lifting/thrusting method of acupuncture manipulation using the motion sensor by clicking the button presented in the software. The real-time motion wave data can also be acquired using the rotation method.\nRepeat this at least eight times to enhance acupuncture manipulation skills.\n3. Data Processing\nFilter out the fluctuating low-frequency signals (< 0.2 Hz) and high-frequency noise signals (> 5 Hz) by applying the infinite impulse response (IIR). Use the Butterworth filter, which allows for filtering of information in a frequency signal that is either lower than 0.2 Hz or higher than 5 Hz.\nSeparate the filtered signals of the participants into repeated motion units by detecting local maximum and minimum points.\nTo generate a pattern template for each participant, normalize the duration (length of sampled motion unit) and amplitude (magnitude of lifting/thrusting or rotation) in every sampled unit.",
    "Calculate the average amplitude and duration of a sampled motion unit for each participant.\nExtract the main frequency from the actual movement using a Fourier transformation, so that the error between the main frequency and frequency of the intended movement is shown on the program screen after the participant finishes a 1-minute training session.\nAnalyze the normalized motion units for each participant using a generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) method9.\n\tNote: In GAMM, model a single manipulation movement (M) for a participant as the sum of smooth function in time (t) and random intercepts for individual units (u). In other words, model M = s(t) + b(u), where M is the motion for a participant, s(t) is a smooth function in time, and b(u) is random intercepts for individual units. Our previous study explained the GAMM model and the calculation of the mean square error (MSE) in detail9.\nCalculate the mean square error (MSE) between the intended movement and the extracted motion pattern of the actual movement by the participant between the first and the last trial of acupuncture manipulation9.\nAnalyze data from the first and the last trial using a two-sample t-test to identify changes in acupuncture manipulation after visual feedback."
