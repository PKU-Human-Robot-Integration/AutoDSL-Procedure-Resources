    "NOTE: The complete experimental sensing curve indicates that the experimental process can be categorized into eight distinct stages.\n1. Sample and buffer preparation\nPrepare sensor chips before the experiment.\n\t\nTreat the chips with the piranha solution (30% H2O2: H2SO4=1:3; v/v) for 2 min. Subsequently, clean the chip thoroughly with a large amount of deionized water and then soak it in anhydrous ethanol, allowing it to dry naturally.\nNext, soak the chip overnight in a solution of 11-mercapto-l-undecanol (MUOH) with a concentration of 50 M. Afterward, place the chip in an epichlorohydrin solution and allow it to react at 25 °C for 4 h.\nRemove the chip from the solution and wash it thoroughly with distilled water and anhydrous ethanol. Finally, drop the dextran basic solution onto the chip's gold film surface and allow it to react at 25°C for 20 h. Clean the chip with deionized water and then immerse it in a bromoacetic acid solution to achieve the dextran hydroxyl carboxymethylation modification. Use quercetin and calycosin with purity ≥98.5% and ≥99%, respectively.\nPrepare all buffers containing running buffer, activator, immobilization buffer (10 mM sodium acetate), and regeneration solution 10 mM Glycine-HCl, pH 1.5. The activator contains 115 mg N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), 750 mg 1-Ethyl-3-(3-dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), and 10.5 mL of 1 M ethanolamine hydrochloride-NaOH at pH 8.5. Dissolve the EDC and NHS by adding 10 mL of filtered deionized water to each vial (see Table of Materials).\n\t​NOTE: Store EDC and NHS aliquots at -18 °C or below, use aliquots within 2 months. All solutions should be degassed before use.\n2. Instrument calibration\nDraw a standard curve of alcohol concentration and peak value injecting alcohol at different concentrations (2%, 1%, 0.5%, 0.2%, and 0.1% volume ratio) on bare gold and comparing the maximum peak value of alcohol.",
    "NOTE: Injecting at a flow rate of 50 µL/min, by origin data analysis software obtained a standard curve.\nAccording to the technical manual, calculate the correction factor of the instrument, represented by K, using the formula:\n\tK=Δθ/Δ[(A-B)/(A+B)]\n\tIn this formula, A and B represent the signal values of the respective detectors. The theoretical slope value, as indicated in the manual, is 0.06. Therefore, the correction factor, K, can be calculated as K=0.06/R, (where R is the slope of the linear regression equation obtained from the standard curve).\nMultiply the measured Δ[(A-B)/(A+B)] value by the correction factor to get the actual Δθ value.\n3. Basic system operation\nTo start the system, turn on the power switch and wait until the detection unit reaches the preset temperature (usually 25 °C).\nOpen the Control Software by clicking Start > Program > OpenSPRTM Control Software, and the software program will automatically connect to the host system after running.\nFollow the standard operating procedure of the SPR instrument to install the COOH chip (glucan-based chip). Firstly, put a drop of cedar oil on the back of the SPR biochip. Then, attach the COOH chip to the prism surface of the sensor, ensuring there are no air bubbles between the chip and the prism. Finally, install the flow pool and tighten it to the light spot.\n\tNOTE: Position the flow pool into the designated slot and securely fasten it using the fixing screws. The channel dimensions are 10 mm x 1 mm x 1 mm.\nChip placement\n\t\nTo open the chip hatch, select Insert Chip option from the Tools menu. If there is already a chip in the chip bay, click Eject Chip option in the Tools menu.",
    "Select the corresponding Chip Type from the chip type drop-down menu if using a new chip and fill in the chip ID with the experimental information related to the chip. The chip lot number can be filled in (optional). If it is a used chip, select Reuse Chip and find the corresponding chip information in the chip ID drop-down menu.\nHold the chip with the word side facing up, gently push the chip into the card slot following the direction of the arrow on the chip, and finally close the door of the chip compartment.\nClick Dock Chip button. The system will automatically switch to the standby state after the chip is placed.\nTo flush the entire internal flow system at a high flow rate, select Tools > Prime command > Start. The entire process takes 6-7 min. Click Close to automatically switch the system to the standby state.\nPress and hold the Black Button on the right side of the tube holder and open the metal cover to the left. After placing the appropriate test tube, gently close the metal lid. If you hear a click sound, the metal cover is locked.\nGently push the test tube holder along the card slot into the sample compartment and hear a click sound, indicating that the test tube holder is in the correct position and locked.\nClick OK in the Eject Rack Tray dialog box to automatically feed the rack into the sample compartment and close the door.",
    "NOTE: There is a time limit when the sample cabin door is opened. The door will automatically close after 60 s of opening. In the last 15 s, the countdown in the dialog box appears in red font and flashes. Wait for the door to close before re-opening it to avoid pinching your hand.\nNormalization of response signals\n\t\nSelect Tool > More Tools, select Normalize in the Maintenance Tools directory, and click Start > Next.\nAdd 120 µL of 70% BIAnormalizing solution to a 7 mm test tube. Place the test tube in the specified position shown in the program (R2F6). After confirming that the tube holder lid is properly closed, place the tube holder in the sample compartment and close the cabin door, and click Start to run the program.\n4. Ligand capturing\npH measurement\n\t\nBefore fixing ligands on the chip, screen a suitable ligand buffer pH to enrich ligands near the surface of the chip through electrostatic adsorption to achieve a better coupling effect. The general ligand concentration is 10-100 µg/mL, and for the first experiment, try using 20 µg/mL.\nScreen the ligand from 10 mM sodium acetate with pH values of 5.5, 5.0, 4.5, and 4. To set the process parameters, select Run-Wizard, Surface Preparation-Immobilization pH Scouting, and click New.\nSelect the chip channel, which can be chosen from channels 1, 2, 3, or 4. The buffer has four preset conditions: 10 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 5.0, 4.5, and 4. Next, enter the ligand name, contact time (180 s), and flow rate (5 µL/min).",
    "After the surface is regenerated with 50 mM NaOH, set the chip surface temperature and the temperature of the sample chamber. Next, select sample and reagent rack1 on the left, and place the solution according to the corresponding position in the sample rack. Save the experimental method and start the experiment by clicking Next.\nLigand immobilization\n\t\nSelect Run-Wizard, Surface Preparation-Immobilization and click New. Set the mobilization capability to four channels: FC1, FC2, FC3, and FC4. Generally, channel 1 is used as the reference when pairing channels 1 and 2, and channel 3 is the reference when mobilizing all four channels.\nUse the reference channels for blank contrast or activation-closed ligand-free fixation, using channels 1 and 2 to couple ligands on channel 2.\n\t\t​NOTE: There are two coupling modes available: aim for immobilized level and specify contact time. In the aim for immobilized level mode, enter the target coupling level, and the software will automatically achieve the corresponding level. The contact time mode requires the input of injection time and flow rate and is generally used based on pre-experiments.\n5. Multi-cycle analyte method\nRun Prime and fill the syringe and chamber with a fixed buffer. Select Run-Manual run, select Channels 1-2 in series on the flow path, and click Start.\nBegin running at the maximum flow rate (150 µL/min) and detect the buffer which is HEPES (pH 7.4). When a stable baseline is reached, flush the sample ring with buffer and empty the sample ring.\n\tNOTE: If the baseline (a line of equilibrium formed on the sensing curve when the buffer is run) is not reached within 10 min, try injecting 10 mM of sodium hydroxide for 30 s.\nActivate the chip with EDC/NHS (1:1, 50 µL each) solution.",
    "Run 200 µL of ligand diluted with the activated buffer on the sample for 4 min. Once the binding is stabilized, wash the sample ring with buffer.\nSample 200 µL of blocking solution, rinse the sample ring with buffer, and empty it with air. Observe the baseline for 5 min to ensure stability.\nDilute the analytes with buffer solution, then take 3.9 µM, 7.8 µM, 15.625 µM, and 31.25 µM quercetin, and 15.625 µM, 31.25 µM, 62.5 µM, 125 µM, and 250 µM calycosin, as samples at 20 µL/min.\nThe binding time of protein (10 µg/mL-50 µg/mL) and ligand is 240 s, with a natural dissociation time of 360 s. Increase flow rate to 150 µL/min and inject appropriate regeneration buffer to remove analyte.\n6. Regeneration\nFor regeneration, use 10 mM Glycine-HCl, high salt, or acid-base solutions of varying pH levels (e.g., 2.5, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, etc.).\nTo screen the regeneration conditions, use run-wizard-assay development-regeneration scouting and click New. Select 1-2 channels in series on the flow path, select the chip, and click Next.\nTo warm up the chip, click on Startup, which should be done more than 3x. Enter the name of the analyte and set the flow rate of the regenerated solution to 150 µL/min.\n7. Data analysis\nAnalyze the experimental results using an SPR data analysis software, using the One to One analysis model.\n\t​NOTE: The whole process is conducted in the running buffer. The other buffers used in the SPR assay process are the same as the injection buffer.\n8. System maintenance",
    "After completing the experiment, remove the detection chip and replace it with the maintenance chip. Replace the running buffer with enough fresh pure water and flush the system with prime. Once primed, the system will automatically switch to standby mode to clean the waste liquid bottle and change the needle water.\nSubscription Required. Please recommend JoVE to your librarian."
