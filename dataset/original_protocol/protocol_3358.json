    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nPart I: Mixing cells with microbubbles and plasmids\nTiming: 30 min\nThese steps prepare the mixture of cells, activated microbubbles and PI/Cal Green or plasmids (i.e., pGFP, pmNG or other plasmid of interest) for sonoporation. Thorough mixing of the components improves the sonoporation efficiency.\nAssembly of sonoporation apparatus (Methods video S1[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc1]):\nFix the transducer on the holder of the tube rack, and place in the water tank.\nAdjust the height of the stage according to the focal length of the transducer and ensure the focal point covers the sample tube.\nConnect the transducer with impedance match that is connected to the Sonic Concepts system using a waterproof BNC-UHF cable.\nFill degassed DI water in the tank and top off the tube stage.\nPrepare cell solutions for validation of the sonoporation parameters (for Part III):\nGenerate cell pellets of 2 × 105 cells in 0.5-mL Eppendorf tubes and suspend in 100 μL degassed PBS (+/+).\nNote: Calcium and magnesium in PBS (+/+) is important in many cellular processes, such as signaling, adhesion, and proliferation. The addition of calcium and magnesium ions to PBS maintains the normal physiological functions of cells in vitro and improves experimental outcomes.\nMix with 2 μL of PI, 0.2 μL of Cal Green and 5 μL of activated microbubbles, and add them to the cell suspensions.\nAdd degassed PBS (+/+) to achieve a total volume of 125 μL in the sample tube.\nThoroughly mix the solution but avoid splashing the liquid into the tube lid.",
    "Note: To ensure thorough mixing of microbubbles, plasmids and cell suspension in the solution in steps 2d and 3d below, gently rotate the Eppendorf tube on a rotator at a fixed speed of 24 rpm. Additionally, flick the tube to dislodge any components adherent to the lid (Methods video S2[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc2]).\nImmediately transfer the tube containing the cell mixture to the sonoporation apparatus, which applies ultrasound to the cells.\nPrepare cell solutions for in vitro plasmid transduction (for Part IV):\nGenerate cell pellets of 2 × 105 in 0.5-mL Eppendorf tubes and suspend in 100 μL degassed PBS (+/+). Troubleshooting 1[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.1].\nMix 9 μg of plasmid and 5 μL of activated Definity microbubbles, and add them to the cell suspensions.\nNote: The plasmid concentration can vary in different preparations. Plasmids are typically stored in glycerol stock at –20°C or –80°C for long-term storage, where the shortage concentration should range from 0.5 to 10 μg/μL. Since cryoprotectant impacts cell function and transfection, it is recommended to concentrate plasmids through lyophilization and reconstitution in either PBS or glycerol stock during storage to achieve the above range.\nAdd degassed PBS (+/+) to achieve a total volume of 125 μL in the sample tube.\nThoroughly mix the solution (as above) but avoid liquid splashing into the tube lid.\nImmediately transfer the tube containing the cell mixture to the sonoporation apparatus, which applies ultrasound to the cells.\nCritical: It is important to perform sonoporation as quickly as possible after mixing the components to ensure the best results. If there is a delay, rotate the tube a few times to keep the components mixed and prevent settling.\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S1.

    "Methods video S2. Thorough mixing of microbubbles, related to step 2\n    \nPart II: Application of ultrasound for sonoporation\nTiming: 1 h\nThese steps induce sonoporation within cells in the Eppendorf tube. Thorough mixing of the components improves the consistency of gene transduction. This protocol is suitable for regular application in cell transfection testing as well as for immediate use in human studies.\nEnter the ultrasound parameters through a computer (‘Remote’ mode) or input them directly from the front panel ('Local’ mode).\nNote: The parameters include the frequency of 250 kHz, the burst length of 33 ms, the period of 500–4000 ms, the total treatment time of 180 s, and the PNPs of 100–200 kPa which correspond to a setting of 200–900 mW on the system (Methods video S3[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc3]).\nNote: It is possible to visualize the ultrasound burst without the sample tube present (Methods video S4[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc4]) and the effect on the microbubbles during ultrasound application is visualized with the Eppendorf tube present (Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5]).\nAfter thorough mixing of the solution (Step 3d in Part II), insert the Eppendorf tube into the place holder at the center of the ultrasound focus.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3123-Fig7.jpg\nFigure 7. Setup for in vitro sonoporation\nThe tube to transducer distance is adjusted to align with the focal point of the 250-kHz ultrasound transducer.\nNote: It is important to ensure that the tube is not floating and is properly positioned at transducer focal region (Figure 7[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig7]).\nPlace an acoustic absorber on the top of the tube to ensure that the ultrasound waves do not escape into the surrounding environment.\nPress the ‘START’ button on the RF drive amplifier and trigger the ultrasound application on the tube. Troubleshooting 2[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.3].",
    "Note: In Methods video S5[href=https://www.wicell.org#mmc5], we first show the effect in an Eppendorf tube with a fluid volume that is too large and second show the effect with the proper fluid volume. Visualize the tube after the experiment to ensure that insonation occurred (Figure 8[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig8]).\nTake off the tube from the sonication apparatus and rotate for 5 min at 20°C. Fix the tube using rubber bands on a rotator for thorough mixing of the sonoporated cells and plasmids. Troubleshooting 3[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.5].\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3123-Fig8.jpg\nFigure 8. Representative pictures of the solutions before and after sonication\nBased on observation, after shaking the cell-microbubble mixture, the larger microbubbles (MBs) tend to float quickly. The MBs with smaller sizes disperse in the mixture solution. The MB concentration in the infranatant was approximately 5 × 104/mL. Without ultrasound exposure, the mixture was stable for 3 min. The solution in the tube is turbid before sonication but is clear after sonoporation, indicating that the microbubbles in the infranatant are destroyed due to the ultrasound bursts.\nNote: To serve as controls, samples treated without ultrasound or without microbubbles are mixed on a rotator for the same duration.\nNote: For cell samples to be used in Part IV, rinse the tube with growth media and then transfer the cells to the appropriate well of a 6-well cell plate (see Part IV, Step 14 for details).\n    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.\n  \n      Methods video S3.

    "These steps validate the ultrasound parameters predicted based on microbubble dynamics simulation for efficient sonoporation in vitro. Propidium iodide (PI) is normally an indicator of dead cells, but due to the increased cell permeability induced by sonoporation, here PI is used as an indicator of sonoporated cells. Cal Green is used as an indicator of live cells.5[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib5]\nFollowing the sonoporation process, add 375 μL of PBS (+/+) to the sample to achieve a total volume of 0.5 mL. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nCell viability measurement.\nTake out 10 μL of sample and thoroughly mix with 0.4% (w/v) Trypan Blue solution (10 μL) using a pipette.\nDraw 10 μL of mixture and add to the cell counter. The cell counter will provide a count of viable cells in the sample.\nCalculate the total number of viable cells per sample by multiplying the number of viable cells per mL by the total sample volume (0.5 mL).\nAnalyze the data and compare the cell viability between the experimental and control groups to determine the significant differences after sonoporation under different ultrasound conditions.\nCentrifuge the cells in the tube (300 × g, 5 min, 4°C) and discard the supernatant.\nPrepare the samples for confocal imaging:\nResuspend the cells in 4% PFA (100 μL), and incubate for 10 min at 20°C in the dark.\nCentrifuge the cells in the tube (300 × g, 5 min, 4°C) and discard the PFA.\nWash the cells with PBS (−/−) and centrifuge again (300 × g, 5 min, 4°C). Discard the PBS.\nResuspend the cells in 30 μL of DI water.\nAdd the cell suspension to a glass slide and spread the cells in a circle within a 12 mm diameter.\nLet the cell suspension dry for at least 30 min at 20°C.",
    "Add a drop of antifade mount reagent on the dried cell samples and carefully place the coverslip on top for further confocal imaging.\nConfocal imaging of PI and Cal Green (Figure 9[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig9]):\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3123-Fig9.jpg\nFigure 9. Confocal images of cells treated with PI (red) and Cal Green (Green)\nUpon treating the sample with microbubbles (MBs) and PNP of 200 kPa ultrasound, a substantial amount of cell debris was observed, while the remaining viable cells exhibited highly saturated PI uptake. Similarly, the use of MBs with lower ultrasound pressure (100 kPa) induced sonoporation, but the PI uptake was lower than that of the MBs+200 kPa ultrasound treatment. Conversely, the samples treated with ultrasound alone or the no-treatment control (NTC) showed low PI penetration, indicating no sonoporation in cells. Scale bar = 50 μm.\nSet up the microscope with the appropriate imaging settings, including the objective lens (40x oil lens), laser intensity, emission filters, and motorized stage for precise movement. PI: excitation peak (Ex) = 566 nm, and emission peak (Em) = 574 nm; Cal Green: Ex = 506 nm; Em = 531 nm.\nUse the microscope to image the sample. Each image is acquired with specific imaging parameters such as the focal plane, exposure time, and laser intensity.\nNote: Before imaging the experimental samples, adjust the confocal parameters using control samples of cells stained with only PI or Cal Green, as well as unstained cells.\nPart IV: Characterization of plasmid transduction\nTiming: 24–48 h\nThese steps aim to assess whether the ultrasound treatment induces sonoporation in cells and determine if the resulting sonoporation effectively enhances plasmid transduction.",
    "After sonoporation, add the plasmid-treated cell suspension to a well of a 6-well plate containing 875 μL cell growth media. The final total volume for each sample is 1 mL. Put the plates into the cell-culture incubator. Troubleshooting 4[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.7].\nCollect supernatant samples and cell samples.\nFollowing a 24-h or 48-h incubation, collect the supernatant from the wells using a sterile pipette and transfer to sterile tubes. Keep the tubes at 4°C to store the samples until further analysis.\nGently wash the cells with PBS (−/−) to remove any residual media. Aspirate the solution.\nAdd 0.5 mL of TrypLE Express to cover the cells and incubate at 37°C for the recommended time (usually 5–10 min for hMSCs).\nCheck the cells under a microscope to ensure they have detached from the bottom of the well and are in a single-cell suspension.\nGently mix the cells with a pipette and transfer them to sterile tubes.\nNote: To prepare for confocal microscopy analysis of adherent cells, the cell samples are seeded in wells containing uncoated 12-mm coverslips and allowed to adhere to the coverslip during culture. Do not use TrypLE Express to harvest the cells on the coverslips.\nNote: The duration of incubation depends on the properties of the plasmids used and the cell types under investigation. For example, the optimal incubation time for observable GFP expression in hMSCs is typically about 24 h, whereas other plasmids (i.e., BMP-6) require up to 48 h to achieve optimal transfection efficiency.",
    "Note: TrypLE Express is a trypsin-like enzyme that is commonly used for detaching cells from culture surfaces. Compared to Trypsin, TrypLE limits the effect on cell viability and yield by reducing damage to the cells during detachment. Additionally, TrypLE does not contain animal-derived components, making it more suitable for applications that require animal-free culture conditions. This is particularly important for research involving human cells for cell therapy or regenerative medicine purposes.\nAlternatives: Trypsin with different concentration of ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) is also available for cell detachment, depending on the cell line and its behavior.\nFlow cytometry for analyzing GFP expression levels.\nCentrifuge the cell samples in a TrypLE-treated cell tube (300 × g, 5 min, 4°C) and discard the supernatant.\nResuspend the cells in 150 μL of PBS (−/−) and add the samples to the wells of a U-bottom 96-well plate.\nCentrifuge the plate (300 × g, 5 min, 4°C). Invert, flick and dab the plate to ensure all the liquid is removed.\nResuspend the cells in 100 μL Live/Dead Blue mix (1:500 dilution in sterile PBS (−/−)), and incubate for 20 min at 4°C in the dark.\nAdd 100 μL of PBS (−/−), and centrifuge the plate (300 × g, 5 min, 4°C). Invert, flick and dab the plate to remove PBS (−/−).\nResuspend the cells in 200 μL of PBS (−/−).\nPrepare compensation controls by using a well with unstained cells, a well with Live/Dead stained cells, and a well with a drop of GFP compensation beads in 175 μL of PBS (−/−).",
    "Note: Alternatively, the cell samples can be fixed (refer to Step 12e) for future analysis. To maintain the accuracy of quantification, we recommend performing measurements on live cells or as soon as possible after fixation to minimize the impact of autofluorescence. Typically, fixed cells samples are stored at 4°C (in a refrigerator) for up to one week.\nExamine the samples using a Guava EasyCyte Flow Cytometer, and process the data with FlowJo Software for analysis. The gating strategy for quantification of the GFP+ cell population is shown in Figure 10[href=https://www.wicell.org#fig10].\nNote: For further information, please see the product brochure of the Guava flow cytometer[href=https://www.emdmillipore.com/US/en/20130828_204340].\nConfocal microscopy for imaging mNG expression in cells.\nimgsrc:https://prod-shared-star-protocols.s3.amazonaws.com/protocols/3123-Fig10.jpg\nFigure 10. Gating strategy for flow cytometry analysis\nIt is important to carefully optimize and validate the gating strategy to ensure accurate and reliable data analysis. First, based on the forward scatter (FSC) and side scatter (SSC), create a gate for single cells. Next, set a live/dead discrimination gate based on Live/dead blue stain to exclude dead cells. Finally, identify the GFP+ cell population relative to the negative control samples.\nWash the cells on the coverslips in the 6-well culture plates with 1 mL PBS (−/−). Repeat this aspiration/wash step twice.\nFix the cells with 500 μL of 4% PFA for 10 min at 20°C in the dark. Aspirate the PFA, and repeat this aspiration/wash step.\nStain the cell nuclei with 500 μL DAPI working solution for 10 min at 20°C in the dark.\nMount the coverslip with the cell samples onto a glass slide using a drop of antifade mount reagent.\nSet up the microscope with the appropriate imaging settings, including the objective lens (20x dry lens or 40x oil lens), laser intensity, emission filters, and motorized stage for precise movement.",
    "Use the microscope to capture multiple images of adjacent regions of the sample, ensuring complete coverage of the specimen with a grid or pattern. Each image is acquired with consistent imaging parameters, including the focal plane, exposure time, and laser intensity. DAPI: Ex = 355 nm, Em = 461 nm; mNG: Ex = 506 nm; Em = 517 nm.\nELISA for measuring the expression levels of the proteins of interest.\nNote: Follow the manufacturer’s specific online protocol[href=https://www.rndsystems.com/products/human-bmp-6-duoset-elisa_dy507] for each ELISA kit. A general outline is described below which has been customized.\nPrepare the working solution of Capture Antibody using PBS (−/−) to dilute the stock solution. Add 100 μL of Capture Antibody in the 96-well plate. Seal the plate and incubate for at least 12 h at 20°C.\nAspiration/wash step: Discard the solutions and wash the wells with Wash Buffer (repeat the washing process twice).\nFor plate blocking, add Reagent Diluent (300 μL) to each well. Incubate at 20°C for at least 1 h.\nAdd 100 μL of the sample collected in Step 15a above per well. Add 100 μL of the standard samples. Seal the plate and incubate 2 h at 20°C. After incubation, repeat the Step 18b. Troubleshooting 5[href=https://www.wicell.org#sec6.9].\nAccording to the manufacturer’s protocol, add Detection Antibody, Streptavidin-HRP, Substrate Solution, and stop solution to each well. Repeat Step 18b when changing the solution.\nImmediately measure the optical density of each well at 450 nm with a microplate reader. Use a reference wavelength of 570 nm to correct for any background signal. Record the readings and use them to calculate the concentration of the analyte in the sample."
