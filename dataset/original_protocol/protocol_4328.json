    "Cell-associated varicella zoster virus (VZV)Grow MeWo or ARPE19 cells in a 24 well plate until they reach 90% confluence (~300,000 or 200,000 cells/well when seeding ~24 h before the infection, respectively). Use 500 µl/well volume to grow and infect the cells. The use of MeWo cells for VZV is documented in Heineman and Cohen (1994), Eisfeld et al. (2007) and Markus et al. (2011).Prepare 10-fold serial dilutions of VZV-infected MeWo cells. Typically, the range of the dilutions is 10-1 to 10-6 of the initial stock. The volume inoculated to each well can range up to 500 µl. Add the infected cells to the 24-well plate containing the 90% confluent naïve cell cultures in triplicate and incubate at 37 °C for at least 2 h. There is no special need to replace the medium after the addition of the inoculum, therefore the infected-cells can be left overnight as well. No agar overlay is required as no secondary plaques are formed by VZV, which does not release virions into the overlaying medium.Using a 10x objective with a fluorescent microscope, count all the fluorescent foci (groups of fluorescent cells) in each well after 2-5 days. Take care not to count the same fluorescent focus twice, and screen all the wells in the same order. This process can be automated with a microscope equipped with a computerized stage and image analysis software. If all fluorescent foci have developed into plaques then units used for the final virus concentration are plaque forming units (PFU).To calculate the PFU/ml, use the average number of foci in the wells with an input virus dilution resulting in 10-100 foci. For example, if the 10-3 dilution resulted in 24, 26 and 30 fluorescent foci per well, and the inoculated amount was 100 µl, then the stock concentration isimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180107/20180107193406_3181.",
    "jpgCell-free VZVGrow ARPE19 cells in a 24 well plate until they reach 90% confluence (~200,000 cells/well when seeding ~24 h before the infection). These cells are more easily infected at low VZV concentrations as compared to MeWo or MRC5 cells (Schmidt-Chanasit et al., 2008; Pasdeloup et al., 2013). Use 500 µl/well volume to grow and infect the cells.Prepare 5-fold serial dilutions of cell-free VZV in high glucose DMEM. In our experience, diluting the virus in growth medium for cells which are not sensitive to the presence of serum does not seem to affect viral infectivity. Typically, the range of the dilutions is 1:5 to 1:625 of the initial stock.Inoculate the ARPE19 cells with 100-150 µl/well of the viral dilutions in triplicates. In a CO2 incubator, let the virus adsorb to the cell monolayer for 2 h, agitating occasionally.Remove the inoculum and add 0.5 ml pre-warmed growth media per well. No agar overlay is required since no secondary plaques are formed by VZV, which does not release virions into the overlaying medium.Monitor the cells for fluorescent foci formation. Usually, 5 days are sufficient for the foci to be easily countable, but this can vary between viruses and experiments.Using a 10x objective with a fluorescent microscope, count all the fluorescent foci (groups of fluorescent cells) in each well after 3-5 days. Take care not to count the same fluorescent focus twice, and screen all the wells in the same order. This process can be automated with a microscope equipped with a computerized stage and image analysis software.

The use of Vero cells for HSV1 and PRV is documented in Moffat et al. (1998), Nicola and Straus (2004) and Pasdeloup et al. (2013).Prepare 10-fold serial dilutions of the virus in high glucose DMEM. Typically, the range of the dilutions is 10-2 to 10-7 of the initial stock. Keep the dilutions on ice.Inoculate the Vero cells with 100 µl/well of the virus in quadruplicates. Let the virus adsorb to the cell monolayer for 1 h in a CO2 incubator, agitating every 15 min.Remove the inoculum and cover the cells with 1 ml of overlaying medium containing 0.3% agarose per well. Work quickly so that the media will not start to solidify before its addition to the cells.Monitor the cultures for formation of fluorescent foci, usually less than 4 days. Using a 10x objective with a fluorescent microscope, count all the fluorescent foci (groups of fluorescent cells) in each well after 3-5 days. Take care not to count the same fluorescent focus twice, and screen all the wells in the same order. This process can be automated with a microscope equipped with a computerized stage and image analysis software.

Fix the cells with 100 µl 4% PFA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. Wash twice with PBS, and add 0.1% crystal violet solution for 10 min. Carefully wash with water until the liquid no longer has traces of blue (usually about 5 rinses). Count the plaques and calculate the PFU/ml as above.Multiplicity of infection (MOI) calculationIn general, the equation of the multiplicity of infection is the following:imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180107/20180107193451_2490.jpgIn order to calculate the MOI, you should first determine the number of cells you are infecting, and the titer of the virus inoculated on them.For example, if 2.5 x 104 human foreskin fibroblasts are seeded in each well of a 24 well-plate, and 250 µl of 104 PFU/ml VZV were used to infect it, the MOI isimgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20180107/20180107193502_2469.jpg"
