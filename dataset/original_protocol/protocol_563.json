    "**1. Preparation of dialyzed IVIg and BSA**     TIMING  12-16 h\ni) Determine the volume of IVIg required by taking into account the number of experimental conditions and the number of mice per experimental condition \\(see Step 3). Use a likewise prepared BSA solution as a control.\nii) Remove the required  length of  the dialysis tubing \\(approximately 15-17 cm for 3-4 mL) and  rinse in distilled H<sub>2</sub>0.\niii) Transfer the desired volume of IVIg or BSA solution into dialysis tube, tie the ends of the tubing, and transfer the tube into sterile beaker containing sterile PBS \\(pH 7.2). \niv) Stir in a beaker overnight at 4<sup>o</sup>C. \n**2. Cell preparation**        TIMING 2 h    \nRemove spleens from appropriate mice  and  mechanically disrupt in 5 mL of culture medium and filter through a 70- &#x3BC;m nylon cell strainer. \ni) Lyse RBC using 1mL of  ACK buffer for 5 min.\nii) Wash cells 2x in RPMI-1640. \nAlternatively, total splenic leukocytes may be replaced with specific cell type. Cell type selected will depend on the experimental set up.\n\\(A) Purification of CD11c+  and CD11c- cells            TIMING  3-4 h \n\\(i) Prepare CD11c+ and CD11c- cell fractions from splenic leukocytes by magnetic separation using the mouse CD11c positive selection kit according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions.\n\\(ii) Disrupt spleen in RPMI-1640 containing 43 U/mL collagenase IV for 20 minutes at 37<sup>o</sup>C.\n\\(iii) Further disrupt the spleen and add EDTA \\(1mM final concentration) for 5 minutes at 37<sup>o</sup>C and filter the spleen preparation through a 70 &#xB5;m nylon cell strainer.\n\\(iv) Wash splenic leukocytes with CD11c purification buffer. \n\\(v) Resuspend the splenic leukocytes in CD11c purification buffer to 2x10\\(8) nucleated cells/mL and incubate with CD11c-PE at 15 &#xB5;L/mL for 15 min at 22<sup>o</sup>C.",
    "\\(vi) After washing, incubate the splenic leukocytes in PE selection cocktail \\(100 &#xB5;L cocktail/mL of cells) for 15 minutes at 22<sup>o</sup>C. \n\\(vii) Add magnetic particles \\(50 &#xB5;L/mL cells) and incubated for 10 min at 22<sup>o</sup>C, followed by separation using a magnet. \n\\(viii) Collect the supernatant as the CD11c- cell fraction.\n\\(ix) Remove the tube from the magnet, resuspend the cells as CD11c+ fraction, wash 1x in RPMI-1640.\n\\(B) Purification of CD11b+  and CD11b- cells            TIMING  3-4 h  \n\\(i) Prepare CD11b+ and CD11b- cell fractions using CD11b immunomagnetic beads according to the manufacturer&#x2019;s instructions.\n\\(ii) Prepare a single-cell suspension by disrupting the spleen in RPMI-1640 and filter through a 70-&#x3BC;m nylon cell strainer.\n\\(iii) After RBC lysis using ACK buffer and washing using RPMI-1640, resuspend cells \\(10<sup>8</sup>/mL) in CD11b purification buffer containing CD11b microbeads \\(10 &#x3BC;L/10<sup>7</sup>) cells). \n\\(iv) Incubate for 15 minutes at 4<sup>o</sup>C.\n\\(v) Wash the cells in CD11b purification buffer and apply  to MACS column. \n\\(vi) Collect the effluent as  CD11b- cell fraction. \n\\(vii) Remove the column from the magnet and flush the cells from the column as  CD11b+  fraction.\n**3. Cell priming** TIMING 1 h   \n     \n\\(A) Incubate splenic leukocytes \\(1.4x10<sup>6</sup>/mL) with 18 mg/mL IVIg or BSA for 30 min at 37<sup>o</sup>C. For CD11c+ or CD11b+ cells use 1.4x10<sup>5</sup>/mL, and for CD11c- or CD11b- cells use  1.4x10<sup>6</sup>/mL. \ni) Wash cells 2x in RPMI-1640.\nii) Resuspend in culture medium to 5x10<sup>6</sup>/mL\n**4. Alternative methods  of leukocyte priming** TIMING 2 h\n\\(A) Fc&#x3B3;RIIIA crosslinking\n\\(i) Incubate splenic leukocytes \\(2x10<sup>7</sup>/mL) with antibody 2.4G2 \\(2.5 &#x3BC;g/mL) or normal rat IgG \\(2.5 &#x3BC;g/mL) for 15 min at 22<sup>o</sup>C in culture medium.\n\\(ii) Wash cells 1x in RPMI-1640.\n\\(iii) Incubate cells \\(2x10<sup>7</sup>/mL) with goat F\\(ab')2 anti-rat IgG \\(25 &#x3BC;g/mL) for 30 min at 37<sup>o</sup>C. \n\\(iv) Wash 2x in RPMI-1640.",
