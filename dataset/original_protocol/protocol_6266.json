    "Soil samplingCollect soil samples (4 kg per experimental set-up) from the uppermost layer (0-10 cm deep) in a sterile zippered bag.Sieve the collected soil samples using a 2-mm mesh sieve.Utilize the sieved soil for DNA extraction, cultivation, and preparation of soil extract (SE).Preparation of culture mediaPrepare R2A, TSA, LB, and NB culture media according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer (Table 1).Prepare 50% diluted R2A by mixing equal amount of normal R2A media and distilled water (d/w) (For example 1 L normal R2A media + 1 L d/w).Prepare R2A-SE by using SE instead of d/w. (Recipe 1).Prepare starch-casein agar-SE (SCA-SE) and J26-SE media by using SE and the composition as mentioned in Table 1 (see Recipe 2). J26-SE media is laboratory formulated media and refer to Table 1 for its preparation.Construction of the diffusion bioreactorTake 2 L plastic container to prepare it as the inner chamber of the diffusion bioreactor.Make holes (6 mm in diameter) in the wall of the inner chamber as shown in Figure 1. To make holes, use electric drill machine or screw driver (with heating) of defined size. Maintain the space of 8 mm in length between the holes.imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190925/20190925212638_2206.jpgFigure 1. Design of the diffusion bioreactor. A.

Overall experimental setup using the newly developed diffusion bioreactor (Figure adapted from Chaudhary et al., 2019).Stick polycarbonate membrane (0.45 µm pore size) on the outer side of the inner chamber.Experimental setup with constructed diffusion bioreactorPlace the inner chamber inside the outer chamber (4 L plastic container).Fill the gap between the walls of the two chambers with soil.",
    "Mix 3 g of soil sample with 300 ml of respective culture medium properly and then add this mixture in the inner chamber. Also, place a magnetic stir inside the inner chamber. (Figures 1 and 2).imgsrc:https://en-cdn.bio-protocol.org/attached/image/20190925/20190925212711_4029.jpgFigure 2. Experimental setup for diffusion bioreactor (Chaudhary et al., 2019)Close and seal tightly the lid of the inner chamber with the sealing tape.Keep stirring (at 60-80 rpm) the diffusion bioreactors on the magnetic stirrer and incubate at room temperature for 4 weeks.Set up a similar experiment for each of the assayed culture media (R2A, TSB, LB, NB, 50% R2A, R2A-SC, J26-SE, and SCA-SE).After incubation, perform the sampling by taking 1 ml of culture broth from diffusion bioreactor and serially dilute the sample. For serial dilution, use freshly prepared normal saline.Spread 100 µl of serially diluted samples from each dilution (10-1-10-7) onto the agar plates for each respective medium. Perform each spreading in duplicates.Incubate aerobically at 25 °C for 4 weeks.After incubation, select the isolated colonies from each plate.Perform subculture repeatedly (at least twice) to obtain pure colonies.Identify pure colonies by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis.PCR amplification and 16S rRNA gene sequencingExtract genomic DNA from the pure colonies using DNA isolation kit.Perform PCR amplification for 16S rRNA gene using the following primer set and conditions:Primers (Frank et al., 2008)Forward (27F), 5’-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3’Reverse (1492R), 5’-TACGGYTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3’Reaction mixture30 µl reaction mixture containing 20 ng of genomic DNAPCR conditions95 °C, 2 min35 cycles: 95 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1 min72 °C, 10 minPurify the PCR products using a Multiscreen PCR384 Filter Plate kit.Sequence the purified PCR products using a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v.3.1 (Applied Biosystems) in a 3730XL DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems).",

Phylogenetic tree. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood algorithm based on nearly complete 16S rRNA gene sequences. It shows the taxonomic affiliations of previously uncultured bacteria using the newly developed diffusion bioreactor with representatives of different established phylogenetic groups (Figure adapted from Chaudhary et al., 2019).Extraction of DNA from soilExtract DNA from soil samples using FastDNA SPIN kit (MP Biomedicals) following the manufacturer’s instructions.Assess the quality of DNA with 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.Determine the purity and concentration of extracted DNA using MaestroNano spectrophotometer (MaestroGen).PCR amplification and pyrosequencingPerform PCR amplification for V1-V3 regions of 16S rRNA gene using the following primer set and PCR conditions:Primers (Hur et al., 2011; Okubo et al., 2012)27F: 5′-CCTATCCCCTGTGTGCCTTGGCAGTC-TCAG-AC-GAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′518R: 5′-CCATCTCATCCCTGCGTGTCTCCGAC-TCAG-X-ACWTTACCGCGGCTGCTGG-3′; where ‘X’ represents unique barcode for each subject.PCR conditions30 °C, 5 min30 cycles: 95 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s72 °C, 10 minAssess the PCR amplicons by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis.Purify the PCR amplicons using QIAQuick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen)Perform the pyrosequencing of the purified PCR products using Roche/454 GS FLX Titanium platform following the manufacturer’s instructions."
