    "Fixation and nuclei extraction   Grow synchronized populations of worms on one large LB agar plate (100 x 15 mm) seeded with OP50 bacteria (~20,000 worms).   Wash worms off the plate with cold M9.   Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,200 x g to pellet the worms.   Wash 3 times with cold M9.   Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,200 x g to pellet the worms.   Fix the worms with 2% paraformaldehyde in 10 ml M9 buffer for 30 min at room temperature on rotation.    Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,200 x g to pellet the worms.   Discard the supernatant and wash one time with 10 ml cold 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5).   Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,200 x g to pellet the worms.   Wash the worm pellet twice with 10 ml cold M9 buffers.   Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,200 x g to pellet the worms and discard the supernatant. Note: At this step you can freeze the worm pellet and store at -80 °C.   Resuspend worm pellet in 2 ml cold Nuclei extraction buffer.   Transfer 2 ml of worms to a steel dounce (on ice) and stroke at least 30 times. Note: Check under the microscope that the worms have been crushed.   Transfer 2 ml of lysate to two RNase free 1.5 ml microfuge tubes and centrifuge 2 min at 40 x g at 4 °C.   Transfer the supernatant to two new RNase free 1.5 ml microfuge tubes.   Centrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C to pellet the nuclear fraction.   Discard the supernatant and wash the nuclear pellet with 1 ml of cold nuclei extraction buffer.  Note: Combine the two pellets in one RNase free 1.5 ml microfuge tube.   Centrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C to pellet the nuclear fraction.",
    "Repeat steps 17 and 18 twice.   Centrifuge for 5 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C to pellet the nuclear fraction.   Resuspend the nuclear pellet in 500 μl RIPA buffer.      Sonication   Transfer the lysate to a 1.5 ml Bioruptor TPX® polymethylpentene tube.   Sonicate sample for 20 min at 4 °C (settings: 30 sec on, 30 sec off, level high 320 W, wave frequency 20 kHz).    Centrifuge for 5 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C. Transfer the supernatant (containing chromatin) to a new RNase free 1.5 ml microfuge tube. Note: At this step samples can be stored at -80 °C.      Immunoprecipitation   Take 1/20 fraction of the supernatant for the input RNA extraction and store on ice.   Use 30 μl of anti-Flag M2 affinity gel for each immunoprecipitation.   Equilibrate the affinity gel with 1 ml of RIPA buffer.   Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C.   Repeat steps 27 and 28.   Add supernatant from step 24 to the equilibrated affinity gel.   Incubate on rotation (continuous rotation at 8rpm) for 1 h at 4 °C.   Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C.   Wash the affinity gel with 1 ml TSE150 buffer and incubate on rotation for 1 min at 4 °C.   Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C.   Discard the supernatant and wash the affinity gel 2 times with 1 ml TSE500 buffer and incubate on rotation for 1 min at 4 °C.    Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C.   Discard the supernatant and wash the affinity gel with 1 ml TSE1000 buffer and incubate on rotation for 5 min at 4 °C.   Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C.",
    "Discard the supernatant and wash the affinity gel with 1 ml LiCl buffer and incubate on rotation for 5 min at 4 °C.   Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C.   Discard the supernatant and wash the affinity gel 2 times with 1 ml TE buffer.   Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C.   Discard the supernatant and remove as much as possible buffer using P200 pipette tips.   Elute the protein-RNA complexes from the affinity gel using 200 μl of elution buffer.   Incubate with rotation for 1 h at 4 °C.   Centrifuge for 1 min at 1,000 x g at 4 °C.   Transfer the supernatant to a new RNase free 1.5 ml microfuge tube.      Reverse crosslink   Take the 200 μl of supernatant from step 47 and input RNA from step 25 (to a final volume of 200 μl with elution buffer) and treat them with 1 μl (20 μg) of proteinase K for 1 h at 45 °C.      RNA purification   Add 750 μl of TRI Reagent® solution to the samples from step 48 and vortex for 30 sec.   Add 100 μl of BCP and vortex for 30 sec.   Incubate at room temperature for 10 min.   Centrifuge for 15 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C.   Transfer the top aqueous phase in a new RNase free 1.5 ml microfuge tube.   Add 1.5 μl of GlycoblueTM and 50 μl of 3 M sodium acetate.   Mix and add 1 volume of isopropanol (typically 400-500 μl).   Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.   Centrifuge for 20 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C.   Wash the RNA pellet with 1 ml of 70% ethanol.   Centrifuge for 5 min at 7,500 x g at 4 °C.   Resuspend the pellet in 44 μl of RNase-free UltraPureTM distilled water.",
    "DNase treatment   Add 5 μl of 10x TURBO DNase buffer and 1 μl of TURBO DNase to the samples from step 60.   Incubate 30 min at 37 °C.   Add 450 μl of RNase-Free UltraPureTM distilled water (total volume 500 μl).   Add 500 μl of Phenol:Chloroform:IAA and mix by vortex.   Transfer the mixture to 1.5 ml Phase Lock Gel tube and centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 5 min at 4 °C.   Transfer top aqueous phase in a new RNase free 1.5 ml microfuge tube.   Add 1.5 μl of GlycoblueTM and 50 μl of 3 M sodium acetate and mix by vortex.   Add 1 volume of isopropanol (typically 400-500 μl) and mix by vortex.   Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.   Centrifuge for 20 min at 12,000 x g at 4 °C.   Wash the RNA pellet with 1 ml of 70% ethanol.   Centrifuge for 5 min at 7,500 x g at 4 °C.   Resuspend in 12.5 μl ofRNase-Free UltraPureTM distilled water.      cDNA Synthesis   Add to the samples from step 73, 1 μl of random hexamer primers, 4 μl of 5x reaction buffer, 0.5 μl of RNase Inhibitor, 1 μl of dNTP mix (0.5 mM final concentration), and 1 μl of Maxima reverse transcriptase.   Incubate 10 min at 25 °C followed by 60 min at 37 °C.   Stop the reaction by heating at 70 °C for 10 min. Note: The reverse transcription reaction can be stored at -20 °C.      qPCR   Dilute the 20 μl sample from step 76 with 100 μl of nuclease free water and use 5 μl as a template in 25 μl qPCR reaction (performed in triplicate reactions); add 12.5 μl of 2x QuantiFast SYBR® Green mix, and primers to a final concentration of 0.6 μM.",
    "For the amplification of nascent RNAs, the primers have to be designed in such a way that at least one PCR primer (forward or reverse) is located in an intron of a target gene and the amplicon is 70-100 bp long. The average Ct value from triplicate qPCR reactions will be consider to calculate the percentage of input. For more information about the percentage of input calculation see http://www.lifetechnologies.com/us/en/home/life-science/epigenetics-noncoding-rna-research/chromatin-remodeling/chromatin-immunoprecipitation-chip/chip-analysis.html.[href=http://www.lifetechnologies.com/us/en/home/life-science/epigenetics-noncoding-rna-research/chromatin-remodeling/chromatin-immunoprecipitation-chip/chip-analysis.html]   For qPCR cycling conditions use the parameters suggested by QuantiFast SYBR® Green mix manufacturers.  Note: The best way to represent the data is by percentage of input (see Figure 1)."
