    "Step-by-step method details\nStep-by-step method details\nHeat inactivation of virus (Batejat et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib1])\nTiming: 30 min\nNote: By the end of this step, the virus gets inactivated, and now all the remaining sample processing steps can be performed in the BSL-2 facility.\nCaution: SARS-CoV-2 Samples should be handled in a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory using BSL-3 practices till virus inactivation is performed and post inactivation, all other steps can be performed on BSL-2 facility.\nNasopharyngeal samples (NPS) and oropharyngeal samples together were collected into 1 mL of viral transport media.\nAround 500 uL of the sample was incubated with a pre-warmed dry heating block maintained at 92°C for 15 min.\nHomogenization of respiratory specimen (Dowling et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7])\nTiming: 5–7 min per sample\nNote: By the end of this step, all the cell's macromolecules like proteins, metabolites, lipids, etc., will be released in solution.\nRespiratory specimens may contain host cells, mucus, bacterial and viral components. Thus, it is essential to homogenize the samples.\nCaution: The high-frequency sound emitted by the Sonicator can damage hearing; therefore, place the sample in a noise isolating chamber and always close the door while operating. Do not grasp an activated horn or touch the tip of a vibrating probe. It can cause severe tissue damage and burns.\nTake 500 μL of respiratory specimen in a new microcentrifuge tube (MCT) and keep it on the ice during homogenization.\nPlace the sample in a noise isolating chamber and submerge the Sonicator probe into the sample.\nNote: The probe should not touch the walls of MCT as it will break the tube and destroy the sample.\nClose the door of the chamber after properly placing the sample tube.",
    "Run the program at Power 20%, Run time 5 min (Cycle – 10 s ON, 10 s OFF) and temperature 22°C.\nRemove and wipe the probe with ethanol.\nNote: Keep the sample on the ice during all the homogenization steps step 2–6.\nPause point: Respiratory specimen can be stored at −80°C for up to 4 weeks.\nOrganic solvent-mediated protein precipitation (Bradford, 1976[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4]; Simpson and Beynon, 2010[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib12])\nTiming: 90 min\nNote: By the end of this step, all proteins will be precipitated.\n200 uL of VTM was placed in acetone compatible tube.\nAdd the 6-fold volume of cold acetone to VTM.\nVortex and incubate for 1–4 h at −80°C.\nCentrifuge for 10 min at 18,000 g.\nCarefully decant the supernatant without disturbing the protein pellet.\nAllow pellet to air dry for 10–30 min in an uncapped tube. (Do not over dry otherwise, the pellet may not resuspend properly)\nResuspend the pellet in 50 uL of Ammonium Bicarbonate Buffer (ABC buffer).\nProtein estimation using Bradford assay (Bradford, 1976[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib4])\nTiming: 30 min\nNote: By the end of this step, the protein concentration of all samples can be quantified.\nTo prepare BSA standards and associated calibration curve, make a stock solution of 2 mg/mL of BSA in PBS.\nNow label vials A to I, and add the stock or the master solution and Buffer as directed in the table below to achieve the desired results concentration of standard.\ntable:files/protocols_protocol_1306_19.csv\nIn a 96 well plate, 5 uL of pre-prepared BSA standards along with blank were added.\n5 uL of unknown samples was also loaded.\nNow to each well, 245 uL of Bradford reagent was added.\nKeep it on a shaker for 15–30 s.\nNow incubate at 25°C for 10 min in the dark.\nTake absorbance at 595 nm within 60 min post-incubation.",
    "Plot a standard absorbance curve at 595 nm on the \"Y\" axis versus the protein concentration on the \"X\" axis.\nRecord the value \"x\" of unknown samples from the graph corresponding to absorbance reading and determine the protein concentration.\nSDS PAGE mediated intra-sample variability detection (Nowakowski et al., 2014[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib10])\nTiming: 5 h\nNote: By the end of this step, the intrasample variability among samples and in their associated group can be detected.\nIn-gel casting apparatus assemble glass plates and spacers.\nMix the component of resolving gel (12%).\nPour the resolving gel mixture between the gel plates till a level 2 cm below the top of the shorter plate.\nPace a layer of Distilled H2O over the top of the resolving gel to prevent meniscus formation in the resolving gel.\nIncubate resolving gel for 30 min at 25°C\nDrain the water from the top of the resolving gel and wick any remaining water away with a Kimwipe.\nMix stacking gel components and pour into gel plates (on top of resolving gel) to fill the gel plates.\nInsert comb at the top of the spacers.\nRemove the comb and assemble cast gel into the SDS apparatus.\nAdd 1× bromophenol blue to each sample.\nAdd freshly prepared 1× running buffer to both chambers of the apparatus\nNow load DNA ladder in first well, 5 ug BSA in another well, and 30 ug equivalent unknown sample protein in other wells.\nRun the gel at 100 V till the dye front migrates into the running gel (∼15 min) and then increase to 120 V until the dye front reaches the bottom of the gel (∼1.5 h.).\nNow Remove the gel from the apparatus and by removing the spacers and glass plates.\nPlace the gel into a small tray.",
    "Note: Never use a metal spatula to separate the glass plates.\nAdd ∼25 mL staining solution and incubate for > 30 min with gentle shaking.\nAdd ∼5 mL destaining solution and destain for ∼1 min with gentle shaking, then Pour off and discard the destain solution.\nFurther, add ∼ 30 mL of destain solution and destain with gentle shaking until the gel is visibly distained (> 2 h).\nPour off and discard the destain solution and rewash the gel with distilled water.\nVisualize on GelDoc.\nIn-solution protein digestion (Gundry et al., 2009[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib8])\nTiming: 26 h\nNote: By the end of this step, all the proteins will be digested, and tryptic peptides will be generated.\n50 ug equivalent proteins are diluted using the buffer till the final volume becomes 100 uL.\nAdd 20 uL of 10 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT) and incubate at 60°C for 1 h in a water bath to reduce proteins.\nPost-reduction, add 15 uL of 10 mM Iodoacetamide and incubate for 30 min in the dark for alkylation of proteins,\nAdd 5 uL of modified sequencing grade trypsin (1 ug/5 uL) reconstituted in 100 uL ABC buffer.\nIncubate at 37°C for 20–24 h in a water bath.\nAfter incubation, add 5 uL of 0.1% (v/v) Formic acid to the reaction mixture to inhibit trypsin activity.\nC18 column mediated desaltation of peptides (Dowling et al., 2020[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib7])\nTiming: 90 min\nNote: By the end of this step, all the contaminants, e.g., salt, will be removed.\nPlease open a new Pierce C18 column, place it in an empty 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube,\nIncubate it with 250 uL of Buffer C for 5 min (Column Washing).\nCentrifuge for 2 min on a tabletop centrifuge and discard the flowthrough.",

    "The peptides were eluted by a 3–95% gradient of buffer B (aqueous 80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid) with a continuous flow rate of 300 nL/min for about 60 min on a 25-cm analytical C18 column (C18, 3 mm, 100 A).\nThe peptides were analyzed using a mass spectrometer with the collision-induced dissociation mode with the electrospray voltage 2.3 kV.\nAnalysis on the orbitrap was performed with full scan MS spectra with a resolution of 70,000 from m/z 350 to 1800. Mascot algorithm (Mascot 2.4, Matrix Science).\nSignificant proteins were identified at (p < 0.05) and q values (p < 0.05). The threshold of false discovery rate was kept at 0.01.\nDatabase curation for host proteome, metaproteome, and virome (Maras et al., 2021[href=https://www.wicell.org#bib9])\nNote: By the end of this step, the database would be curated on which MS.raw files would be mapped.\nThe raw files generated post-LC-MS/MS analysis were analyzed using Proteome discoverer 2.2 for protein identification and quantification.\nOne of the most crucial parts is database curation, against which the mass spectrometric files need to be searched. So, in our case, we created three databases: a Virome (COVID) database, another for humans, and one for metaproteome.\nTo curate the database, visit https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/[href=https://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/].\nFind proteome for your organism of interest by searching for them from proteome ID, e.g., UP000005640 – Homo sapiens) or taxonomic name or ID.\nNow click on the download button> Select all protein entries > Fasta (canonical, compressed, and isoform).
