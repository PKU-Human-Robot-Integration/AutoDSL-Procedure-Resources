    "Construction of sgRNA expression vectors\n1. Design of paired sgRNA oligos.\n  Select paired sgRNAs in a tail-to-tail orientation and separated by 10–30 bp, which have the sequence 5’-CCN\\(52–72)GG.  All possible paired sites for mouse and human exons are available on our website \\(http://www.sanger.ac.uk/htgt/wge/).  For each sgRNA, the 5’-GGN\\(19)GG motif is preferred, however, 5’-GN\\(20)GG or 5’-N\\(21)GG are also satisfactory.  BLAT or BLAST the sgRNA target sites in UCSC or ENSEMBL genome browsers to find those with few or no highly related sites in the genome. Order sgRNA oligos as described in Figure 2.\n2. Annealing oligos prior to cloning.\n  4.5 µl Top Oligo \\(100 µM)\n4.5 µl bottom Oligo \\(100 µM)\n1 µl NEB buffer 2          \nAnnealing oligos using a thermocycler with the following program<sup>2</sup>:\n95°C, 5 min; 95–85°C at −2°C /s; 85–25°C at −0.1°C /s; hold at 4°C.\n3. Preparation of pUC57-sgRNA plasmid.\n  2 µg pUC57-sgRNA\n1 µl CutSmart Buffer\n1 µl BsaI          \nAdd water up to 50 µl and incubate at 37°C for 2 h with occasional shake.\nPurify the digestion product using MinElute PCR Purification Kit.\n4.

Digest paired sgRNA plasmids with Dra I and purify the digestion product.\n  10 µg paired sgRNA plasmids \\(5 µg each)\n10 µl 10 x M buffer\n5 µl Dra I \\(15U/ µl)",
    "Add water up to 100 µl and incubate at 37°C for 3 h with occasional shake.\nCheck plasmids were digested completely by gel electrophoresis, loading 2 µl in 1% agarose gel. Two bands \\(1621 and 1152 bp) will be observed.

    "4. Purify the sgRNAs by MEGAclear™ Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\n  RNA elution option 2 in the manual is preferred.\nPrecipitate with 5 M Ammonium Acetate and ethanol.\nResuspend the pellet using the 30 μL RNase free water.\n20–50 μg RNA will be obtained depending on the quality of DNA template. \n5. Assess sgRNA yield using the One Drop OD-1000+ Spectrophotometer \\(or equivalent) and sgRNA quality by gel electrophoresis.  RNA is loaded in DNA loading buffer and run on a 1% agarose gel \\(180 V for 10 min).\n  6. Aliquot and store at -80°C. The sgRNAs are stable for one year without freeze-thaw cycles.\n  \nTranscription of Cas9-D10A _in vitro_ \n1. Ensure that reagents, tubes and tips are RNase-free and that the work is done in a ribonuclease-free environment.\n  2.

RNA is loaded in DNA loading buffer and run on a 1% agarose gel \\(180 V for 10 min).  A yield of 30-60 μg mRNA is expected.",
    "Note: Due to the size of the Cas9-D10A mRNA, no visible size shift is seen after poly-A tailing. The mRNA quality is good if a smear is not observed.\n6. Aliquot and store at -80°C. Cas9-D10A mRNA is stable for one year without freeze-thaw cycles.\n  \nCollection of zygotes\n1. Superovulate 4-week-old female C57BL/6J \\(~12–14 g) mice by intraperitoneal injection with PMSG \\(5 IU/100 µl) at 14:00 of day 1 and with HCG \\(5 IU/100 µl) at 13:00 of day 3.\n  2. Cross superovulated females with males \\(C57BL/6J or CBA).\n  3. Identify plugged females at 9:00 of day 4. Collect one-cell embryos as described3.\n  \nPreparation of microinjection mixture\n1. Thaw aliquots of the Cas9-D10A mRNA and sgRNAs on ice. Dilute the Cas9-D10A mRNA with EmbryoMax® Injection Buffer to a concentration of 20 ng/μl and the sgRNAs \\(5 ng/μl each) in a final volume of 50 μl. Pipette the mixture up and down several times.\n  2. Centrifuge at 4°C for 1 min at top speed, and carefully transfer 45 μl supernatant to a new tube.  Always keep the tube on ice.\n  \nMicroinjection and embryo transfer\nMicroinjection and embryo transfer are performed using standard methods for generation of transgenic mice as described<sup>4-6</sup>.  We prefer to inject the RNA mixture into both the cytoplasm and larger \\(male) pronucleus.\nGenotyping founders\n1. Tail tips from founders \\(5-day-old) are collected and digested overnight at 58°C with lysis buffer containing 100 µg/ml Proteinase K.  Genomic DNA is extracted by phenol-chloroform and purified by alcohol precipitation.\n  2. Target regions \\(300–700 bp) are PCR amplified from genomic DNA and the products are purified with the PCR Cleanup Kit. Purified PCR products are denatured and reannealed in NEBuffer 2 in a thermocycler using the program<sup>2</sup>: 95°C, 5 min; 95–85°C at −2°C /s; 85–25°C at −0.1°C /s; hold at 4°C.",
    "3. Hybridized PCR products are digested with 0.5 µl T7EN1 at 37°C for 30 min and separated by 2% agarose gel7. Mutant founders will yield lower molecular weight cleavage bands.\n  4. Cloning and sequencing of PCR amplicons from genomic DNA of mutant founders is used to characterize the mutations.  T-A cloning of PCR products is performed using the T-Vector pMDTM19 kit according to manufacturer’s instructions."
